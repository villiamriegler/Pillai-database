2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
An important goal of diabetes care is to achieve adequate glycaemic control in order to reduce 
long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications caused by chronic hyperglycaemia. 
Achieving and maintaining glycaemic treatment goals is a challenge and, in practice, most 
patients will eventually require multiple medications during the course of their disease to 
maintain glycaemic control. Multiple professional organisations, including the ADA, AACE and 
IDF, advocate earlier use of combination therapy in patients with T2DM who have inadequate 
control with monotherapy, and at least two (EASD and Canadian Diabetes Association [CDA]) 
recommend earlier combination therapy when patients have more marked or persistent 
hyperglycaemia. 
Adherence to therapy is especially important for the management of chronic diseases such as 
diabetes, but the need for multiple antidiabetic medications to achieve and then sustain adequate 
HbA1c control often leads to poor adherence. Recent reviews indicate that levels of 
non-adherence in patients with T2DM range from 10% to 30%. Poor adherence leads to 
inadequate glycaemic control and subsequently increased risk of associated complications. Thus, 
a new therapeutic combination of dapagliflozin and metformin available as one tablet would 
provide a treatment option for patients with T2DM, and should improve patient compliance. 
Dapagliflozin propanediol monohydrate (dapagliflozin) is a first-in-class compound that inhibits 
the human renal sodium-dependent glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2), the major transporter 
responsible for renal glucose reabsorption. Dapagliflozin’s mechanism of action is different from 
and complementary to currently available treatment options, and results in the direct and 
insulin-independent elimination of glucose by the kidney. Thus dapagliflozin (INN) lowers plasma 
glucose by inhibiting the renal reabsorption of glucose, and by promoting its urinary excretion. 
Glucosuria, the result of the inhibition of glucose reabsorption, is the primary pharmacodynamic 
effect of the drug, and results in a lowering of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations within 
one week; improved glycaemic control as measured by a reduction in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), 
FPG and postprandial glucose (PPG); and the urinary loss of approximately 280 kcalories/day, 
which ultimately leads to a decrease in weight and body fat. This effect directly addresses one of 
the basic underlying problems in the pathogenesis of T2DM, namely caloric excess. In addition, 
the mild diuretic effect is also associated with modest blood pressure reductions. Furthermore, 
dapagliflozin is associated with a low risk of hypoglycaemia. Finally, as SGLT2 is primarily 
expressed in the kidney, the highly selective nature of dapagliflozin minimises the risk of 
off-target (non-kidney) effects.  
Dapagliflozin marketing authorization (Forxiga - Dapagliflozin film-coated tablet 5 and 10 mg) 
was granted on 12 November 2012. The data submitted in this application is focused on the fixed 
dose combination. Further information on dapagliflozin free treatment can be found in the EPAR 
of Forxiga. 
Metformin hydrochloride (metformin), a biguanide, is a well-characterised medicine that has 
been in widespread use for decades. It is the first-line agent of choice for T2DM, endorsed by 
professional organisations such as European Association for the Study of Diabetes (EASD); 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620505/2013 
Page 9/105 
 
  
  
American Diabetes Association (ADA); American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE); 
and International Diabetes Federation (IDF). Metformin lowers HbA1c, FPG and PPG 
concentrations in patients with T2DM, improving glycaemic control by reducing hepatic glucose 
production, decreasing intestinal absorption of glucose, and improving insulin sensitivity by 
increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilisation. 
A combination of drugs with complementary mechanisms of action, and with clinically important 
effects on HbA1c, FPG, PPG and weight loss, is expected to form a clinically relevant paradigm 
for achieving and maintaining glycaemic control in patients who have difficulty with maintaining 
glycaemic control on metformin alone, or in combination with other oral antidiabetic drugs 
(OADs) or insulin. 
2.2.    Quality aspects 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing a fixed-dose combination of 
dapagliflozin propanediol monohydrate equivalent to 5 mg dapagliflozin and 850 mg and 1000 
mg of metformin hydrochloride as the active substances.  
Other ingredients are hydroxypropylcellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, magnesium stearate, 
sodium starch glycollate type A and film coating composed of polyvinyl alcohol, macrogol 3350, 
talc, titanium dioxide, iron oxide yellow or iron oxide red. 
The product is available in PVC/Aclar//Alu blister packs. 
Active Substance 
Dapagliflozin propanediol monohydrate 
The chemical name of dapagliflozin propanediol monohydrate is (2S,3R,4R,5S,6R)-2-[4-Chloro-
3-(4-ethoxybenzyl)phenyl]-6-(hydroxymethyl)tetrahydro- 2H-pyran-3,4,5-triol, (2S)-propane-
1,2-diol (1:1) monohydrate and has the following structure: 
Dapagliflozin (INN) is a white to off-white powder, soluble in many polar organic solvents and 
non-hygroscopic. Dapagliflozin is a chiral molecule with five stereogenic centres. Only one 
polymorphic form has been observed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620505/2013 
Page 10/105 
 
  
  
 
 The same information on dapagliflozin was submitted in the marketing authorization application 
(MAA) of Forxiga (Dapagliflozin film-coated tablet 5 and 10 mg). It has been confirmed that this 
current application has taken into account all the amendments and responses applicable to the 
application Forxiga. 
Manufacture 
The manufacture of the final active substance was satisfactorily described including a flow-
chartand consists in three main steps: synthesis of the two intermediates and synthesis of the 
final active substance . 
The starting materials, reagents and solvents used for the synthesis of the active substance were 
adequately characterised and justified. The starting materials mark the points in the synthesis 
beyond which GMP and regulatory change control were applied.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates were adequately presented as well as the analytical 
methods used.  
Impurities including residual solvents have been well characterised and controlled during the 
manufacturing process.  
To demonstrate process reproducibility and performance, the potential variables of input 
materials and process parameters that may have an impact on the quality of each intermediate 
and dapagliflozin propanediol were evaluated.  
Based on the risk assessment and other development work, there were no critical process 
parameters (CPPs) identified for the manufacturing process.  
Satisfactory In-process control (IPC) tests were applied throughout the manufacturing process to 
ensure the quality of dapagliflozin propanediol. The acceptance criteria established for reaction 
completion of each process step were based on development and manufacturing experience 
gained during the production of dapagliflozin propanediol to date.  
 The batch analysis data demonstrated the consistency in the quality of batches of dapagliflozin 
propanediol. No data was presented with regard to process validation. However, this was 
considered acceptable since dapagliflozin propanediol is a fully synthetic compound and a non-
sterile active substance.  
A post-approval change management (PACM) protocol for changes in the current supplier of 
starting material was provided as well as a commitment to update the PACM protocol as 
necessary.  
The applicant provided the following general information about its development and control 
strategy:  
• Appropriate critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the active substance were identified on the 
basis of their potential impact on the safety and efficacy of the drug product and thus the 
patient.  
• A collective risk assessment was performed to define quality attributes of the starting materials 
and process intermediates which have the potential to impact the CQAs of the active substance. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620505/2013 
Page 11/105 
 
  
  
In summary, potential variability in the starting materials was understood and appropriate 
specifications have been established.  
• Then individual risk assessment for each step of the process was carried out using a Failure 
Mode Analysis (FMEA) to identify process parameters that could impact the quality attribute of 
the intermediates and may directly or indirectly impact the CQAs of the active substance. These 
process parameters were designated as potential CPPs and were studied further using univariate 
and/or multivariate experiments, as appropriate, to ascertain interdependence of process 
parameters, if any, and to establish Proven Acceptable Ranges (PARs). PARs have been 
established for parameters which may impact the quality attributes with appropriate control 
strategies for the commercial manufacture of dapagliflozin propanediol.  
• Impurities attributed to the starting materials were also controlled. The quality attributes of the 
intermediates from each step that could impact the next process step or intermediate were 
identified with defined control strategies.  
Based on the control strategy for the active substance, it was concluded that no process 
parameters were identified as high risk. In conclusion, the predefined quality of dapagliflozin 
propanediol was achieved and assured by the design of a reproducible and robust manufacturing 
process with established controls. A set of active substance specifications has been established 
that verifies the CQAs and other quality attributes of dapagliflozin propanediol. 
Specification 
Adequate specification was presented and the following parameters were evaluated: appearance 
(visual), colour (visual), identification (IR and HPLC), assay (HPLC), propylene glycol (GC), water 
content (Karl-Fisher), related substances (HPLC), residual solvents (GC) and particle size (Laser 
Light Scattering).  
The analytical methods were described and satisfactory validated in accordance with the ICH 
guidelines. 
Analytical data for 25 batches manufactured with the proposed commercial process have been 
provided. Seven of these batches were of full production scale. Results were found satisfactory. 
The specification was adequately justified and in line with the corresponding ICH guidelines on 
impurities and residual solvents. 
Stability  
Stability studies were conducted on three primary batches of the active substance kept in a 
packaging similar to the commercial packaging under the following ICH conditions: 24 months 
under long term, 25 °C and 60% RH and intermediate 30 °C and 65% RH, 6 months under 
accelerated 40 °C and 75% RH and stress studies including photostability).  
The parameters tested included: appearance, colour, identity (HPLC), assay (HPLC), organic 
impurities (HPLC), polymorphic identity (X-ray powder diffraction), water content and propylene 
glycol content. The analytical methods used during stability studies were the same as the ones 
Assessment report

Page 12/105 
 
  
  
 
 
 
used for the control of the active substance apart from the X-ray method that was presented 
separately.  
Results of the stability study were found well within the specification limits for all the conditions. 
Trends in the long-term, intermediate and accelerated stability data so far indicate no 
degradation of the active substance.  
Based on the stability study data presented, the re-test period proposed by the applicant when 
stored in the primary packaging can be approved. 
Metformin hydrochloride 
The chemical name of metformin hydrochloride (metformin HCl)  is 1,1-Dimethylbiguanide 
hydrochloride and has the following structure: 
Metformin (INN) consists of white crystals, freely soluble in water, slightly soluble in alcohol, 
practically insoluble in acetone and in methylene chloride. Polymorphism is inexistent. The 
substance is non-hygroscopic.  
As there is a monograph of metformin hydrochloride in the Phar. Eur., the manufacturer of the 
active substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia 
(CEP) for metformin hydrochloride which has been provided within the current Marketing 
Authorisation Application.  
Manufacture 
This active substance is sourced by one manufacturer which provides a Certificate of Suitability 
(CEP) in support of its quality. Therefore, the relevant information has been assessed by the 
European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines (EDQM) before issuing the CEP. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes the requirements of Ph Eur monograph Metformin 
Hydrochloride and some additional limits and tests. 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual), filter test (visual), 
appearance of aqueous solution (Ph Eur), identification (IR), identification of chlorides (Ph Eur), 
related substances (HPLC), heavy metals (Ph Eur), loss on drying (Ph Eur), sulphated ash (Ph 
Eur), assay (HPLC) and microbiological testing (Ph Eur).  
The analytical methods used are all compendial and satisfactory batch analysis data on three 
recent manufactured batches is provided. The results are within the specifications and consistent 
from batch to batch.

Stability  
Stability of this active substance is covered by the CEP which contains a re-test period without 
any storage condition when stored in the proposed container. 
2.2.1.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
Dapagliflozin and metformin (Dapa/Met) film-coated tablets were developed as a fixed dose 
combination product to ensure their in vivo performance to be bioequivalent to the mono therapy 
products of dapagliflozin and metformin. Dapa/Met has been developed as four combinations of 
doses (2.5/850, 2.5/1000, 5/850 and 5/1000) but only doses 5mg/850 mg and 5/1000 mg are 
intended for commercial purposes.  
A structured quality by design QbD approach including a science and risk-based model of 
pharmaceutical development of Dapa/Met was applied. Extensive, prior knowledge and 
experience within Bristol-Myers Squibb referring to both drug substances and also previous 
development of a dapagliflozin mono therapy drug product and combination drug products, were 
used in the development of Dapa/Met. 
Quality risk assessments (on safety and efficacy) and design of experiments (DoE) were 
performed to understand the quality of the input raw materials required for a robust formulation 
and the impact of manufacturing process parameters on the critical quality attributes (CQAs) of 
the drug product. The quality target product profile (QTPP) for the finished product Dapa/Met 
was adequately designed.  
The use of risk management was applied throughout the formulation and process development 
as well as for establishment of the control strategy. The risks were considered early in 
development phase.  
These risks were reduced by selection of the process type. A fluid bed granulation process was 
chosen  
The choice of the active substances has been discussed for this type II diabetes combination. 
Dapagliflozin has a high solubility over the clinical dose range and membrane permeability, it is a 
BCS III compound (high solubility/poor permeability based on <90% absolute oral bioavailability) 
but has BCS I-like characteristics (high solubility/high in vitro permeability and/or >90% 
absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract). Also, dapagliflozin is not regarded as an active 
substance with a narrow therapeutic range. The active substance showed satisfactory physical 
and chemical stability and was not sensitive to light. Metformin HCl is compendial a BCS Class III 
compound. 
Compatibility between the two active substances was demonstrated in stability studies. The 
studies confirmed the compatibility of dapagliflozin and metformin HCl with the excipients used 
for the formulation. 
Both dapagliflozin propanediol and metformin HCl are highly soluble throughout the physiological 
range, hence the dissolution is mainly controlled by the disintegration of the tablet resulting in

both drug substances dissolution being similar. The dissolution method was found to be 
satisfactory and discriminatory. 
All excipients are well-known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. 
Eur. Standards and EC Directive 2009/35/EC. There are no novel excipients used in the finished 
product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The Dapa/Met 2.5+850 mg and Dapa/Met 5+1000 mg strengths were selected for the 
bioequivalence study to “bracket” the other two developed strengths of Dapa/Met 2.5+1000 mg 
and Dapa/Met 5+850 mg. Bioequivalence of each active ingredient in the fixed-dose combination 
product to that of the individual mono therapy products administered concomitantly for both 
strengths investigated was established.  
Comparable in vitro dissolution profiles with regard to dapagliflozin and metformin have been 
provided for the respective Dapa/Met product strengths throughout the physiological pH range.  
The proposed commercial manufacturing process is widely used in the pharmaceutical industry. 
All studies from laboratory scale to commercial scale included the same process steps and types 
of equipment, the only difference being adjustments of parameter ranges due to scale. The 
manufacturing process has been well investigated through Design of Experimental studies in 
different scales to gain knowledge and understanding of the manufacturing process. 
In summary, the pharmaceutical development and the bioequivalence of the fixed-dose 
combination product were appropriately discussed and the robustness of the formulation was 
confirmed in manufacturing process studies. The manufacturing process studies performed have 
lead to a comprehensive understanding of the proposed manufacturing process, from laboratory 
to commercial scale. 
The primary packaging is PVC/Aclar//Alu blister packs. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and 
EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data 
and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the magnesium stearate used in the formulation is of vegetable origin. No 
excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process consists of 8 main steps: metformin HCl/magnesium stearate blend, 
preparation of granulation liquid, fluid bed granulation, milling, final blending (two steps, 
blending and lubrication), compression, film coating and packaging.  A narrative of the process 
as well as a flow chart has been provided including all the reagents, equipment, conditions, 
manufacturing steps and appropriate in-process controls.The process is considered to be a 
standard manufacturing process with a non-functional film-coating. A satisfactory validation 
protocol has been submitted and appropriate in-process controls and key process parameters 
have been put in place to ensure the quality of the drug product through all the manufacturing 
steps.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620505/2013 
Page 15/105 
 
  
  
It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished 
product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls and key process 
parameters are adequate for this standard film-coated tablet.  
Product specification 
The finished product release and end of shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this 
kind of dosage form: description (visual), identification dapagliflozin (HPLC and UV), 
identification metformin (HPLC and UV), assay dapagliflozin (HPLC), assay metformin (HPLC), 
related substances dapagliflozin (HPLC), related substances metformin (HPLC), disintegration 
(Ph.Eur.), dissolution (HPLC), uniformity of dosage units dapagliflozin (Ph.Eur. content 
uniformity, HPLC) and metformin (Ph.Eur. mass variation) and microbiological quality (Ph.Eur.). 
The finished product specification is satisfactory. Acceptance criteria have been justified with 
respect to conventional pharmaceutical requirements as prescribed in the relevant dosage form 
monograph of the European Pharmacopoeia and the ICH Q6A guideline. Non-compendial 
analytical methods have been described and validated satisfactorily in accordance with ICH 
guidelines.  
Batch analysis data was presented for 3 pilot-scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability 
Stability data on 3 pilot-scale batches of each strength (and 1 pilot-scale batch of each strength 
for intermediate, accelerated and stressed conditions ) stored in commercial packaging 
PVC/Aclar//Alu  blister under ICH long-term (24 months at 25°C/60%RH), accelerated (6 months 
at 40°C/75%RH) and stressed conditions (photostability testing , 13 months open dish storage at 
25°C/60%RH and bulk container 24 months at 30°C/65%RH) were provided. 
Samples were tested for description, assay dapagliflozin, assay metformin, organic impurities 
dapagliflozin, organic impurities metformin, dissolution dapagliflozin, dissolution metformin, 
microbial purity. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
In addition photostability investigations have been conducted according to ICH Q1B option 2 to 
confirm that Dapa/Met is not sensitive to light.

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substances and finished 
product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to 
the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical 
use.  
2.2.3.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform 
clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory 
way.

Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
This marketing authorisation application seeks to register Xigduo, containing the active 
substances dapagliflozin and metformin. It is intended as a fixed dose combination medicinal 
product for oral use in one pharmaceutical form (film-coated tablets) and two strengths 
(5mg/850 mg and 5 mg/1000 mg), and two presentations (perforated blisters and non-
perforated blisters) in several pack sizes.  
The proposed indication for Xigduo is for treatment in adults aged 18 years and older with type 2 
diabetes mellitus (T2DM) as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in 
patients inadequately controlled on metformin alone or in combination with other glucose-
lowering medicinal products, including insulin or those already being treated with the 
combination of dapagliflozin and metformin as separate tablets. 
Dapagliflozin is an inhibitor of human renal sodium glucose co-transporter (SGLT2), the major 
transporter responsible for renal glucose reabsorption. Dapagliflozin (Forxiga) was approved in 
the EU on 12 November 2012. Metformin is a biguanide that improves glycaemic control by 
improving insulin sensitivity. Metformin is a well-established product in the EU. 
The excipients are commonly used in and do not raise any toxicological concerns. 
The non-clinical overview provided an adequate summary and a critical review of relevant data. 
In the overview, the Applicant mainly refers to the data submitted for dapagliflozin and published 
data for metformin. A 3-month oral combination toxicity study and a 7-day oral toxicokinetic 
study in rat with dapagliflozin and metformin were submitted and evaluated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620505/2013 
Page 17/105 
 
  
  
 
All pivotal toxicity studies supporting the safety of the combination of dapagliflozin and 
metformin were appropriately designed and conducted in compliance with International 
Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines and Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations. 
Dose selection for the pivotal combination toxicity study was principally based upon a range-
finding combination toxicity study or from preceding studies with each agent administered 
individually to ensure that adequate doses were evaluated.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Dapagliflozin (BMS-512148) represents a novel mechanism for the treatment of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus. Dapagliflozin is a potent, selective, reversible, competitive inhibitor of human SGLT2, a 
sodium-glucose co-transporter responsible for the renal reabsorption of glucose. Administration 
of dapagliflozin in mice and normal and diabetic rats increases the urinary excretion of glucose 
resulting in decreased serum glucose.6. These effects have been also  observed in patients 
administered dapagliflozin. In pharmacology studies, single doses of dapagliflozin as low as 0.1 
mg/kg in normal rats and as low as 0.01 mg/kg in diabetic rats were demonstrated to be 
pharmacologically active. 
Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent that improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 
diabetes by lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin acts by decreasing 
hepatic glucose production and intestinal absorption of glucose and improving insulin sensitivity 
by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. These effects have been demonstrated in 
both experimental animals and in patients. 
Based upon the different mechanisms of action for dapagliflozin and metformin and the available 
clinical data in patients treated with both drugs, no adverse pharmacologic interactions are 
anticipated. There were also no adverse safety findings noted in nonclinical combination toxicity 
studies conducted with dapagliflozin and metformin. 
Therefore no additional nonclinical pharmacology studies assessing pharmacodynamics/efficacy 
were conducted. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
No new studies have been conducted and submitted. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No new studies have been conducted and submitted. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
In vitro and in vivo safety pharmacology studies evaluating the cardiovascular, central nervous, 
and respiratory systems were previously conducted for dapagliflozin. There were no adverse 
effects indicative of potential human safety concerns. Dedicated safety pharmacology studies 
were not conducted for metformin due to the lack of adverse outcomes derived from extensive 
cumulative clinical data. Therefore evaluation of the combination in a full battery of safety 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620505/2013 
Page 18/105 
 
  
  
pharmacology studies was considered unwarranted. Nevertheless, potential effects of the 
individual compounds and the combination on the central nervous system and respiratory 
function were evaluated as components of the pivotal 3-month dapagliflozin and metformin 
combination repeat-dose rat toxicity study. Dapagliflozin and metformin either alone or in 
combination had no effects on behaviour or respiration in this study at doses up to 5 mg/kg/day 
dapagliflozin (AUC 24.1 μg•h/mL, at Week 13) and 150 mg/kg/day metformin (AUC 28.7 
μg•h/mL at Week 13). 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No specific nonclinical drug interaction studies were conducted with dapagliflozin in combination 
with metformin. However, toxicokinetics was assessed as a part of toxicity studies. Drug 
interactions in humans were previously assessed through the MAA of dapagliflozin. Briefly, the 
AUC for dapagliflozin was decreased only at high doses of metformin used in the 7-day range-
finding study. In the 3-month combination study, dapagliflozin did not affect metformin AUC and 
Cmax nor did metformin affect dapagliflozin AUC and maximum concentration (Cmax). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic endpoints for dapagliflozin and metformin were previously assessed in 
nonclinical and clinical settings. Based on those assessments, no adverse pharmacokinetic 
interactions were expected. Therefore, no additional nonclinical studies were conducted with the 
compounds in combination. Toxicokinetics was assessed as a part of the toxicity studies and no 
significant increase or decrease in dapagliflozin exposure was observed in the presence of 
metformin in these studies. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The individual toxicities of dapagliflozin and metformin were previously established in a 
comprehensive investigational program. To support the safety of the dapagliflozin and metformin 
fixed-dose combination product, additional toxicity and toxicokinetics assessments including 
safety pharmacology endpoints (central nervous and respiratory systems) were conducted as 
part of a 3-month oral toxicity study in rats. 
An 7 day oral toxicokinetic study was conducted in rats to assist in dose selection for the pivotal 
3-month repeat-dose toxicity study. 
The rat was selected for evaluation of potential toxicity based on the experience with 
dapagliflozin, which demonstrated increased sensitivity in this species including increased 
trabecular bone, exacerbated chronic progressive nephropathy, and tissue mineralization. 
Single dose toxicity 
Single-dose toxicity studies were previously conducted with dapagliflozin and metformin alone, 
but no single dose toxicity study was conducted with a combination of dapagliflozin and 
metformin. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620505/2013 
Page 19/105 
 
  
  
Repeat dose toxicity 
GLP-compliant repeat-dose toxicity studies have been previously conducted and reported for 
dapagliflozin alone for up to 6 months duration in rats and 12 months duration in dogs. 
A seven-day non-GLP oral toxicokinetic study in rats (DN09023) was conducted to provide dose-
selection data for the pivotal study. Oral doses of dapagliflozin and metformin up to 50 and 600 
mg/kg/day respectively, were well tolerated either alone or when co-administered for seven days 
to rats. There were no significant drug-drug interactions noted in this study 
A three-month GLP oral toxicity study in rats (DN10008) was conducted to determine the 
toxicologic or toxicokinetic interaction when dapagliflozin and metformin were administrated in 
combination to rats for 3 months. Dapagliflozin at 1 or 5 mg/kg/day was co-administered with 
150 mg/kg/day metformin by oral gavage to groups of 10 rats per sex. Additional groups were 
treated with vehicle, 5 mg/kg/day dapagliflozin or 150 mg/kg/day metformin alone. 
Dapagliflozin-related effects, which occurred with and without metformin, were consistent with 
effects observed in previous studies in rats and/or were generally considered to be a 
consequence of the pharmacological effects of dapagliflozin. 
There was an apparent increase in urinary protein excretion in the dapagliflozin/metformin 
treated rats but this increase was not statistically significant when compared to rats treated with 
dapagliflozin alone. Increases in urinary protein in dapagliflozin/metformin treated rats were 
characterized as having significant variability and had no correlation with any treatment-related 
histopathology in the kidney or urinary tract. Dapagliflozin-induced increases in urinary protein 
were observed in previous rat repeat-dose toxicity studies in the absence of any drug-related 
histopathology and were hypothesized to be due to the osmotic diuretic effects of dapagliflozin. 
Therefore, there was no evidence of any new toxicities or biologically relevant exacerbation of 
existing dapagliflozin-related effects when administered together with metformin. 
AUC exposure multiples for dapagliflozin and metformin at the NOAEL (5/150) relative to 
exposures at the maximal recommended human dose (MRHD) were 52× and 1.4×, respectively. 
Genotoxicity 
Neither dapagliflozin nor metformin were shown previously to be genotoxic, therefore additional 
genotoxicity studies were considered unwarranted. 
Carcinogenicity 
Individually, neither compound was previously shown to be carcinogenic; therefore a 
combination study was considered unwarranted. Two-year rodent carcinogenicity assays did not 
identify any tumorigenic activity for dapagliflozin. Dapagliflozin did not increase the incidence or 
shorten the latency period of tumours at exposure multiples > 100× the MRHD. There was also 
no indication of any dapagliflozin induced hyperplastic or proliferative signals in the rodent 
carcinogenicity studies. The combination of dapagliflozin with metformin would also not be 
expected to increase the carcinogenic potential of either drug.

Reproduction Toxicity 
•  Fertility and early embryonic development 
No adverse effects on fertility or early embryonic development were previously observed with the 
individual  active  ingredients  at  clinically  relevant  exposures;  therefore  it  was  considered 
unwarranted to conduct studies with the combination. 
•  Embryo-fœtal development 
There  was  no  drug-related  teratogenicity  with  either  active  ingredients;  therefore  it  was 
considered unwarranted to conduct studies with the combination. 
•  Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function 
In  rat  studies,  exposure  to  dapagliflozin  was  associated  with  an  increased  incidence  and/or 
severity  of  renal  pelvic  and  tubular  dilatations  in  offspring.  These  outcomes  occurred  with  drug 
exposures  during  periods  of  animal  development  that  correlate  with  the  second  and  third 
trimesters  of  human  pregnancy.  Thus,  dapagliflozin  should  not  be  used  in  the  second  and  third 
trimesters  of  pregnancy  or  during  first  2  years  of  life;  therefore,  no  pre-  and  postnatal 
development studies were conducted with the combination. 
•  Studies in which the offspring (juvenile animals) are dosed and/or further 
evaluated  
An indication is not currently being sought for humans ≤ 18 years of age; therefore no juvenile 
studies were conducted with the combination. 
Local Tolerance  
The intended clinical route of administration is oral therefore no local tolerance studies have been 
conducted with the combination. 
Other toxicity studies

Based on the PEC/PNEC ratios (see above tables) dapagliflozin and metformin respectively are 
unlikely to present a risk to microorganisms, surface water, groundwater and sediment dwelling 
organisms as log Kow does not exceed 4.5. 
In addition, dapagliflozin and metformin are already used as free combination therapy as 
approved marketed products and no significant increase in environmental exposure is 
anticipated. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology  
Dapagliflozin is a potent, selective, reversible, competitive inhibitor of human SGLT2, a sodium-
glucose co-transporter responsible for the renal reabsorption of glucose. Administration of 
dapagliflozin in mice and normal and diabetic rats increases the urinary excretion of glucose 
resulting in decreased serum glucose. These effects have been also been observed in patients 
administered dapagliflozin. In pharmacology studies, single doses of dapagliflozin as low as 0.1 
mg/kg in normal rats and as low as 0.01 mg/kg in diabetic rats were demonstrated to be 
pharmacologically active. 
Metformin is an antihyperglycemic agent that improves glucose tolerance in patients with type 2 
diabetes by lowering both basal and postprandial plasma glucose. Metformin acts by decreasing 
hepatic glucose production and intestinal absorption of glucose and improving insulin sensitivity 
by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. These effects have been demonstrated in 
both experimental animals and in patients. 
Based upon the different mechanisms of action for dapagliflozin and metformin and the available 
clinical data in patients treated with both drugs, no adverse pharmacologic interactions are 
anticipated. There were also no adverse safety findings noted in nonclinical combination toxicity 
studies conducted with dapagliflozin and metformin. Therefore no additional nonclinical 
pharmacology studies assessing pharmacodynamics/efficacy were conducted. This approach is in 
line with The Guideline on the Non-Clinical Development of Fixed Combinations of Medicinal 
Products (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005). 
In vitro and in vivo safety pharmacology studies evaluating the cardiovascular, central nervous, 
and respiratory systems were previously conducted for dapagliflozin. There were no adverse 
effects indicative of potential human safety concerns. Dedicated safety pharmacology studies 
were not conducted for metformin due to the lack of adverse outcomes derived from extensive 
cumulative clinical data. Therefore evaluation of the combination in a full battery of safety 
pharmacology studies was considered unwarranted. Nevertheless, potential effects of the 
individual compounds and the combination on the central nervous system and respiratory 
function were evaluated as components of the pivotal 3-month dapagliflozin and metformin 
combination repeat-dose rat toxicity study. Dapagliflozin and metformin either alone or in 
combination had no effects on behaviour or respiration in this study at doses up to 5 mg/kg/day

dapagliflozin (AUC 24.1 μg•h/mL, at Week 13) and 150 mg/kg/day metformin (AUC 28.7 
μg•h/mL at Week 13). 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic endpoints for dapagliflozin and metformin were previously assessed in 
nonclinical and clinical settings. Based on those assessments, no adverse pharmacokinetic 
interactions were expected. Therefore, no additional nonclinical studies were conducted with the 
compounds in combination. Toxicokinetics was assessed as a part of the toxicity studies.  
Toxicology 
The individual toxicities of dapagliflozin and metformin have been evaluated as a part of previous 
product review and approval processes. The toxicity of the combination of dapagliflozin and 
metformin in animals was formally evaluated in a GLP-compliant repeat-dose 3-month study in 
rats. Safety pharmacology endpoints (central nervous and respiratory systems) were 
incorporated into the repeat-dose rat toxicity study. No toxicokinetic interactions or any additive 
or synergistic toxicity were demonstrated in the rat following 3 months of dosing with the 
combination of dapagliflozin and metformin at doses up to 5 and 150 mg/kg/day, respectively. 
AUC exposure multiples for dapagliflozin and metformin at the NOAEL (5/150) relative to 
exposures at the maximal recommended human dose (MRHD) were 52× and 1.4×, respectively. 
Individually, neither compound was shown to be genotoxic or carcinogenic; therefore additional 
studies on genotoxicity or carcinogenicity are considered unwarranted.  
No adverse effects on fertility or early embryonic development were previously observed with the 
individual compounds at clinically relevant exposures; therefore it is considered unwarranted to 
conduct studies with the combination.  
Environmental risk assessment  
The Applicant has provided individual environmental risk assessments for dapagliflozin and 
metformin, including study reports. The introduction of this FDC is not expected to result in an 
increase in environmental exposure. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considers that since both dapagliflozin and metformin are approved products and that 
the free combination of the two is included in the indication for dapagliflozin, no further data on 
pharmacology are needed. Also, for the assessment of this FDC there is no need to include a 
more detailed description of available data on the pharmacology of the two components. 
It is agreed that no further data or discussion on pharmacokinetics are warranted. 
No concerns were identified in the 3 month repeat-dose toxicity study in rats. The CHMP is of the 
view that no further studies with the combination on genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive 
and developmental toxicity are warranted.

Since dapagliflozin and metformin are already used in free combination therapy as existing 
marketed products the CHMP considers that no significant increase in environmental exposure is 
anticipated. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The FDC clinical development programme included four studies specific to the FDC 
(D1691C00004, D1691C00002, D1691C00005 and D1691C00003), and an additional five studies 
(MB102014, D1690C00012, D1690C00004, D1690C00010 and D1690C00006) providing either 
existing information that is relevant to the FDC submission, or newer long term data and 
combination therapy data that was not available at the time of the initial dapagliflozin MAA 
submission.  
The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of dapagliflozin are documented in the 
approved SmPC of Forxiga. 
The Phase III programme for dapagliflozin was conducted using QD dosing. Hence it was 
necessary to bridge from QD to BID dosing; metformin IR is a BID formulation therefore the IR 
FDC needs to be a BID formulation. Furthermore, the efficacy study using BID dosing utilised 
individual monotherapy tablets. Hence it was necessary to bridge from the individual 
monotherapy tablets to the FDC. These aspects were taken into consideration when designing 
the four FDC specific studies. 
The clinical development programme was designed in accordance with CHMP guidance (CPMP 
2002); Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of diabetes 
mellitus (CPMP/EWP/1080/00 Rev.1) (CHMP 2012); Guideline on Clinical Development of Fixed 
Combination Medicinal Products (CHMP/EWP/240/95 Rev.1) (CHMP 2009); and the 2010 
Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev 1) (CHMP 2010).  
No specific CHMP scientific advice relating to the FDC development programme has been 
received.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of the active substances (dapagliflozin and metformin) has already been 
evaluated during the MAA for the respective mono-component.  
For a fixed dose combination containing known active substances, bioequivalence should be 
demonstrated between the free combination of the reference formulations and the FDC in order 
to support the substitution indication and also to bridge from the monotherapy tablets used in 
the clinical studies. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetic interaction between the two active 
substances should be evaluated (Guideline on clinical development of fixed dose combination 
medicinal products, CHMP/EWP/240/95 Rev. 1). 
The clinical pharmacology programme of dapagliflozin has been fully characterised across 26 
studies, as described in the initial dapagliflozin MAA; a 2 way drug drug interaction study 
between dapagliflozin and metformin (MB102026) has shown no clinically meaningful effect of 
dapagliflozin on metformin pharmacokinetics parameters and vice versa. 
Three clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted specific to the dapagliflozin/metformin 
FDC programme:  
D1691C00004 demonstrates that dapagliflozin has similar pharmacokinetic and 
pharmacodynamic effects whether administered as 5 mg BID or 10 mg QD.  
D1691C00002 demonstrates the bioequivalence of Dapa/Met IR FDC tablets versus individual 
dapagliflozin and metformin IR (European sourced Glucophage) tablets administered together, in 
the fed state. This study bridges the separate doses used in the clinical programme to the FDC 
formulation.  
D1691C00005 documented the effect of food on the pharmacokinetics of the Dapa/Met IR FDC 
administered with or without food (high fat meal). 
Absorption  
•  Bioavailability 
The individual biopharmaceutic profiles of dapagliflozin and metformin have already been 
evaluated during the initial MAA for Forxiga and Glucophage. 
Dapagliflozin 
Dapagliflozin is rapidly and well absorbed after oral administration. Maximum plasma 
concentrations are usually attained within 2 hours after administration in the fasted state. The 
absolute oral bioavailability is approximately 78%. 
Metformin 
After oral administration, metformin hydrochloride absorption is saturable and incomplete. 
Maximum plasma concentrations are reached in 2.5 hours. The absolute bioavailability is 
approximately 50-60 % in healthy subjects.

•  Bioequivalence 
Study D1691C00002 - A two-part, open-label, randomised, single-centre, phase I 
bioequivalence study comparing (Part I) the fixed dose combination dapagliflozin/metformin IR 
tablet (2.5 mg/850 mg) versus the free combination of the dapagliflozin tablet (2.5 mg) and 
metformin IR tablet (850 mg); and (Part II) comparing the fixed dose combination 
dapagliflozin/metformin IR tablet (5 mg/1000 mg) versus the free combination of the 
dapagliflozin tablet (5 mg) and metformin IR tablet (1000 mg) in healthy volunteers, both parts 
in the fed state 
Methods 
Study design  
The study was a single-centre, two-part, randomised, open-label, crossover bioequivalence study 
with 120 healthy volunteers (60 per study part). The first part was a two-way crossover 
comparing Xigduo 2.5 mg/850 mg to the individual mono components. The second part was a 
two-way crossover comparing Xigduo 5 mg/1000 mg to the individual mono components. Part I 
and Part II were independent of each other. Blood samples were collected pre-dose and at 1, 
0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 16, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60 and 72 hours after drug 
administration.  In both parts there was a wash-out period of at least seven days between the 
study periods. All treatments were administered in the fed state. Thirty minutes prior to drug 
administration the subjects received a standardised non-high fat meal (about 650 calories: 26 g 
protein, 43 g fat (32%) and 65 g carbohydrates).

Populations studied   
A total of 120 (60 in each part) adult healthy male and female volunteers, aged 19-45 years 
were enrolled. There were three drop-outs during the study.  In part 1, one subject was 
discontinued due to non-compliance (tested positive for opiates). In part 2, one subject 
discontinued voluntarily and one subject was withdrawn due to safety reasons (elevated CK 
values). The PK-data of subject E0000167 of Period 2 in Part II of the study were excluded from 
the PK analysis due to vomiting shortly after administration of the FDC tablet. 
Subject E0000279 had comparable plasma profiles of dapagliflozin and metformin with other 
individuals after administration of FDC dapagliflozin/metformin 5 mg/1000 mg (Treatment A in 
Part II). However, after administration of dapagliflozin 5 mg + metformin 1000 mg as two 
separated tablets (Treatment B in Part II) dapagliflozin plasma concentrations of this subject 
were below LLOQ at all time-points, but the metformin plasma profile was comparable to other 
individuals. The reason for this is unknown, but most likely, due to non-compliance. Therefore, 
for Subject E0000279, the plasma concentration of dapagliflozin at all time-points after 
administration of dapagliflozin 5 mg + metformin 1000 mg as two separated tablets (Treatment 
B in Part II) were treated as missing for calculation and analysis. As the lack of compliance could 
not be documented, a separate analysis was performed in which subject E0000279 was included 
in the statistical analysis for Treatment B with the dapagliflozin concentration values for this 
subject being set to LLOQ.  
In total, 59 subjects (Part 1) and 58 subjects (Part 2) completed both study periods and were 
included in the pharmacokinetic analysis.   
Analytical methods   
Plasma concentrations of dapagliflozin and metformin were determined with an LC/MS/MS 
method using 13C6-dapagliflozin and metformin-d6 as internal standards. The calibration range 
was 0.200-50 ng/ml for dapagliflozin and 2.00-2000 ng/ml for metformin. 
Pharmacokinetic variables  
The primary objectives of the study are to determine AUC0-t, AUCinf and Cmax for dapagliflozin 
and metformin as single doses and within each FDC formulation and the and bioequivalence will 
be tested with respect to these two PK parameters for 
Part I: one 2.5 mg/850 mg FDC tablet and one single dose of 2.5 mg dapagliflozin 
together with one single dose of 850 mg metformin 
and 
Part II: one 5 mg/1000 mg FDC tablet and one single dose of 5 mg dapagliflozin together 
with one single dose of 1000 mg metformin 
all administered in the fed state. 
The following PK parameters were determined: 
- 
AUC(0-t) Area under plasma concentration-time curve from zero to time t

[amount•time/volume] 
AUCinf Area under plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity 
[amount•time/volume] 
Cmax Maximum plasma (peak) drug concentration [amount/volume] 
tmax The time relative to administration to reach Cmax, [h] 
t1/2 The terminal phase half-life calculated as ln(2)/λz, [h-1] 
The actual sampling times will be used in the PK parameter calculations. Plasma concentrations 
below limit of quantification (LOQ) will be excluded from the calculations except at time points 
prior to Cmax, where plasma concentrations below LOQ will be taken as zero at protocol time 
zero and as missing at all other time points in the calculation. 
Statistical methods   
The PK analysis will be performed using the PK analysis set including all subjects who received 
the investigational product and who have evaluable PK data appropriate for the comparison of 
interest (with no major protocol deviations or violations thought to significantly affect the 
pharmacokinetics of the drug).  
The primary objectives of this study were to demonstrate bioequivalence for newly formulated 
FDC dapagliflozin/metformin 2.5 mg/850 mg and 5mg/1000 mg tablets versus individual 
dapagliflozin and metformin IR tablets (free combinations). For both objectives, bioequivalence 
was demonstrated if the 90% confidence interval (CI) for the formulation effect was contained 
within the interval of 0.800–1.250 for AUC(0-t), AUC(INF) and Cmax with respect to both 
dapagliflozin and metformin. 
AUC(0-t), AUC(INF) and Cmax were log-transformed prior to analysis. All endpoints were 
analysed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model for each part separately, with sequence, 
period and formulation as fixed effects and subject within sequence as a random effect

•  Food Effect 
The effect of food on Xigduo was evaluated in a two-way cross-over study (D1691C00005 ) to 
assess the effect of food on the fixed dose combination dapagliflozin/metformin tablet (5 mg/100 
mg) in 16 healthy male and female volunteers. Following an overnight fast a single oral dose of

the FDC was administered either in the fasting state or 30 min after a high-fat, high-calorie 
breakfast. The breakfast consisted of 800-1000 calories and derived approximately 150 calories 
from protein, 250 from carbohydrate and 500-600 from fat. There was a wash-out period of 7-14 
days between the treatment periods. 
Administration of the FDC under fed conditions had no effect on AUC for neither of the active 
substances. For dapagliflozin there was a 29% decrease in Cmax and tmax was delayed with 1h 
and for metformin there was a 17% decrease in Cmax and tmax was delayed with 2h after 
administration with food.

Forxiga (dapagliflozin) should be administered once daily. Given that metformin is recommended 
to be administered twice daily, bid administration of Xigduo is proposed. A dedicated clinical 
study was performed in order to support the bid posology.  
Study D1691C00004 was an open-label, randomized, two-period crossover study in 16 healthy 
volunteers to assess the effect of dapagliflozin dosed as 10 mg once a day versus 5 mg twice a

Distribution 
Dapagliflozin 
Dapagliflozin is approximately 91% protein bound. Protein binding was not altered in various 
disease states (e.g. renal or hepatic impairment). The mean steady-state volume of distribution 
of dapagliflozin was 118 L. 
Metformin 
Plasma protein binding is negligible. Metformin hydrochloride partitions into erythrocytes.  The 
mean volume of distribution (Vd) ranged between 63-276 L. 
Elimination 
•  Excretion 
Dapagliflozin 
Dapagliflozin and related metabolites are primarily eliminated via urinary excretion with less than 
2% as unchanged dapagliflozin. After administration of a 50 mg [14C]-dapagliflozin dose, 96% 
was recovered, 75% in urine and 21% in faeces. In faeces, approximately 15% of the dose was 
excreted as parent drug. The mean plasma terminal half-life (t1/2) for dapagliflozin was 12.9 
hours following a single oral dose of dapagliflozin 10 mg to healthy subjects. 
Metformin 
Metformin hydrochloride is excreted unchanged in the urine. No metabolites have been identified 
in humans. 
Renal clearance of metformin hydrochloride is >400 ml/min, indicating that metformin 
hydrochloride is eliminated by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion. Following an oral dose, 
the apparent terminal elimination half-life is approximately 6.5 hours.

•  Metabolism 
Dapagliflozin 
Dapagliflozin is extensively metabolised, primarily to yield dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide, which is 
an inactive metabolite. The formation of dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide is mediated by UGT1A9, 
an enzyme present in the liver and kidney, and CYP-mediated metabolism is a minor clearance 
pathway in humans. 
Metformin 
Metformin is not metabolised. 
• 
Inter-conversion 
Dapagliflozin 
Dapagliflozin contains 5 defined stereocenters. No significant inter-conversion occurs in vivo. 
Metformin 
Metformin is not a chiral molecule. 
•  Pharmacokinetics of metabolites 
No active metabolites of dapagliflozin or metformin have been identified. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dapagliflozin 
Dapagliflozin exposure increased proportional to the increment in dapagliflozin dose over the 
range of 0.1 to 500 mg.  The pharmacokinetics of dapagliflozin did not change with time upon 
repeated daily dosing for up to 24 weeks. 
Metformin 
After oral administration, metformin hydrochloride absorption is saturable and incomplete.  It is 
assumed that the pharmacokinetics of metformin hydrochloride absorption is non-linear. No time 
dependency has been described. 
Special populations 
• 
Impaired renal function 
Dapagliflozin 
At steady-state, subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and mild, moderate or severe renal 
impairment had mean systemic exposures of dapagliflozin of 32%, 60% and 87% higher, 
respectively, than those of subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and normal renal function. The 
steady-state 24-hour urinary glucose excretion was highly dependent on renal function and 85, 
52, 18 and 11 g of glucose/day was excreted by subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620505/2013 
Page 37/105 
 
  
  
 
normal renal function or mild, moderate or severe renal impairment, respectively. The impact of 
hemodialysis on dapagliflozin exposure is not known. Since the efficacy of dapagliflozin is 
dependent on renal function, dapagliflozin is not recommended for use in patients with moderate 
to severe renal impairment. 
Metformin 
When renal function is impaired, renal clearance is decreased in proportion to that of creatinine 
and thus the elimination half-life is prolonged, leading to increased levels of metformin 
hydrochloride in plasma. Metformin is contraindicated in patients with renal failure or renal 
dysfunction (creatinine clearance < 60 ml/min). 
• 
Impaired hepatic function 
Dapagliflozin 
In subjects with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh classes A and B), mean Cmax 
and AUC of dapagliflozin were up to 12% and 36% higher, respectively, compared to healthy 
matched control subjects. These differences were not considered to be clinically meaningful. In 
subjects with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class C) mean Cmax and AUC of 
dapagliflozin were 40% and 67% higher than matched healthy controls, respectively.  
No dosage adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. In 
patients with severe hepatic impairment, a starting dose of 5 mg is recommended. 
Metformin 
Metformin is contraindicated in patients with hepatic insufficiency due to the increased risk of 
lactic acidosis. 
•  Elderly 
Dapagliflozin 
In general, no dosage adjustment is recommended based on age. Renal function and risk of 
volume depletion should be taken into account. Due to the limited therapeutic experience in 
patients 75 years and older, initiation of dapagliflozin therapy is not recommended. 
Metformin 
In general, no dosage adjustment is recommended based on age. The risk of impaired renal 
function in the elderly should be taken into account. 
•  Children 
Dapagliflozin 
No data is available.  
Metformin 
After single doses of metformin hydrochloride 500 mg, paediatric patients have shown similar 
pharmacokinetic profile to that observed in healthy adults.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620505/2013 
Page 38/105 
 
  
  
After repeated doses of 500 mg twice daily for 7 days in paediatric patients the peak plasma 
concentration (Cmax) and systemic exposure (AUC0-t) were reduced by approximately 33% and 
40%, respectively compared to diabetic adults who received repeated doses of 500 mg twice 
daily for 14 days. As the dose is individually titrated based on glycaemic control, this is of limited 
clinical relevance. 
Metformin can be used in children from the age of 10 years and in adolescents. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Dapagliflozin/metformin 
Study MB102026 (described in the initial dapagliflozin MAA) was an open-label, 3-period, 3-
treatment, crossover study in 18 healthy fasted subjects randomized to receive single doses of 
20 mg dapagliflozin, 1000 mg metformin and 20 mg dapagliflozin+1000 mg metformin. 
Dapagliflozin AUC and Cmax changed ≤7% and metformin AUC and Cmax ≤5% during co-
administration. 
Dapagliflozin 
In vivo interaction studies were conducted with metformin, pioglitazone, sitagliptin, glimepriride, 
voglibose, hydrochlorothiazide, bumetanide, valsartan, simvastatin, digoxin, warfarin and 
rifampicin. No clinically relevant interactions were observed. Rifampicin decreased dapagliflozin 
AUC by 22%. Dapagliflozin increased AUC of simvastatin by 19% and simvastatin acid by 31%.  
Based on the dapagliflozin PK characteristics, there is a potential for clinically relevant 
interactions with inhibitors and inducers of UGT1A9. Potent in vivo inhibitors of UGT1A9 seem to 
be rare. Co-administration of the UGT1A9 inhibitor mefenamic acid under steady state conditions 
with a single dose of dapagliflozin resulted in a 55% increase in dapagliflozin AUCt, 22% 
reduction in dapagliflozin 3-O-glucuronide AUC and an increase in urine excretion of glucose. 
Metformin 
The following interaction is included in the SmPC proposed by the applicant: Cationic substances 
that are eliminated by renal tubular secretion (e.g. cimetidine) may interact with metformin by 
competing for common renal tubular transport systems. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamic properties as well as the mechanisms of action of active substances 
(dapagliflozin and metformin) have already been evaluated during the MAA for the respective 
mono-component.  
Mechanism of action 
Dapagliflozin inhibits the human renal sodium-dependent glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2), the 
major transporter responsible for renal glucose reabsorption. It is a highly potent (Ki = 0.55 nM), 
selective and reversible inhibitor of human SGLT2, which it inhibits selectively versus human 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620505/2013 
Page 39/105 
 
  
  
SGLT1, the major glucose transporter responsible for the absorption of glucose in the small 
intestine, and is also highly selective versus facilitative glucose transporters.  
Dapagliflozin’s mechanism of action is different from and complementary to currently available 
treatment options, and results in the direct and insulin-independent elimination of glucose by the 
kidney. Thus dapagliflozin lowers plasma glucose by inhibiting the renal reabsorption of glucose, 
and by promoting its urinary excretion. Glucosuria, the result of the inhibition of glucose 
reabsorption, is the primary pharmacodynamic effect of the drug, and results in a lowering of 
fasting plasma glucose (FPG) concentrations within one week; improved glycaemic control as 
measured by a reduction in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), FPG and postprandial glucose (PPG); and 
the urinary loss of approximately 280 kcalories/day, which ultimately leads to a decrease in 
weight and body fat.  
In addition, the diuretic effect is also associated with modest blood pressure reductions. 
Furthermore, dapagliflozin is associated with a low risk of hypoglycaemia.  
Metformin hydrochloride (metformin), a biguanide, is a well-characterised medicine that has 
been in widespread use for decades. Metformin lowers HbA1c, FPG and PPG concentrations in 
patients with T2DM, improving glycaemic control by reducing hepatic glucose production, 
decreasing intestinal absorption of glucose, and improving insulin sensitivity by increasing 
peripheral glucose uptake and utilisation. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Specifically for the fixed dose combination programme, an additional study (D1691C00004) was 
conducted to characterise the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics to provide support for 
dosing with dapagliflozin 5 mg BID. 
In this open-label, randomised, 2-period crossover, single-centre study the PD effects of 
dapagliflozin 10 mg QD versus 5 mg BID (every 12 hours) administered for 5 days were 
investigated. Both treatments were administered after a standard meal and each dosing period 
was separated by a 7- to10-day washout. The primary objective of the study was to compare the 
effects of the 2 dapagliflozin regimens on the percent inhibition of renal glucose re-absorption 
(IRGRA) at steady state (Day 5). This was calculated as the amount of glucose excreted in the 
urine (Uglu) divided by the amount of glucose filtered by the kidney during a collection interval. 
At steady state, the IRGRA demonstrated no significant difference between the BID and QD 
dosing regimens (24-hour percent IRGRA = 34.4% vs 32.2%; ratio = 1.07 [90% CI: 0.95, 
1.21]). 
An exploratory objective was to determine whether dapagliflozin reduces the rate of absorption 
of a meal. The glucose and insulin responses after breakfast, lunch and dinner were determined 
by measurement of the area under the time-effect curves of the plasma levels of glucose and 
insulin over 180 minutes after the meal [AUE(0-180)]. The AUE(0-180) for meal-induced 
increases in glucose levels demonstrated no significant differences between the treatments. For 
insulin, there were no differences after breakfast or dinner but insulin levels were slightly lower 
with the BID regimen after lunch compared with the QD regimen of dapagliflozin [AUE(0-180) 
ratio = 0.84; 90% CI: 0.76, 0.93]. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620505/2013 
Page 40/105 
 
  
  
In study D1691C00004, the exposure-response relationship was explored by a non-linear 
maximum effect (Emax) regression model. Evaluated pharmacodynamic endpoints were percent 
inhibition of renal glucose re-absorption [IRGRA(%)] and the amount of glucose excreted over 
24-hours. The analysis included the average dapagliflozin exposure in 4-hour intervals at steady 
state for both QD (6 points) and BID (3 points) administration. The analysis yielded an EC50 of 
14.72 ng/mL and an Emax of 73.95% for IRGRA. For the average amount of glucose in urine per 
24-hour interval the EC50 was 15.19 ng/mL and Emax of 100 mmol. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The results of the bioequivalence study (D1691C00002) show that for AUC0-t and Cmax the 
90% confidence interval for the ratio of the test and reference products falls within the 
conventional acceptance range of 80.00-125.00% for both dapagliflozin and metformin. Based on 
the provided results the CHMP considers that the bioequivalence between Xigduo FDC and 
dapagliflozin and metformin administered as mono-components has been demonstrated, in an 
adequately designed bioequivalence study. This is crucial in order to support the substitution 
indication as well as bridging from the monotherapy tablets used in the clinical studies. The study 
was conducted under fed conditions, after administration of a low/medium-fat meal. In general 
bioequivalence studies under fed conditions should be performed with a high-fat meal to reflect a 
worst-case scenario. The effect of food on metformin and dapagliflozin is small. The effect of food 
on the FDC-tablet has also been evaluated in study D1691C00005. In this study the food-effect 
was roughly similar to what has previously been described for respective mono-component. 
Hence, it is unlikely that an additional bioequivalence study with a high-fat meal will provide any 
further contribution to the bioequivalence evaluation.  
In the present dossier the applicant is seeking approval for 5 mg / 1000 mg and 5 mg / 850 mg 
strengths. Bioequivalence has been evaluated for the 5 mg/1000 mg and the 2.5 mg/850 mg 
(not applied for) strengths. Taking into consideration that the most extreme strengths (2.5 
mg/850 mg and 5 mg/1000 mg) were evaluated in the bioequivalence study and all quality 
aspects of a biowaiver are fulfilled (see section 2.2.3 of this report for further details) so that the 
strengths can be considered “formulation proportional”, the CHMP considers that a biowaiver for 
the strength of 5 mg/850 mg can be granted based on a bracketing approach.  
The effect of food on Xigduo FDC has been sufficiently evaluated (study D1691C00005). 
Administration of the FDC with a high-fat meal had no effect on AUC for neither of the active 
substances. For dapagliflozin there was a 29% decrease in Cmax and tmax was delayed with 1h 
and for metformin there was a 17% decrease in Cmax and tmax was delayed with 2h after 
administration with food. These finding were similar as previously reported for dapagliflozin. For 
metformin, a slightly larger food effect regarding both AUC and Cmax (25 and 40% decrease 
respectively) has previously been described. This discrepancy is considered to be of minor 
importance. Therefore the CHMP considers that the food-effect was roughly similar as previously 
reported for the mono-components. Taking into consideration that metformin is recommended to 
be administered with a meal to avoid gastro-intestinal adverse events the CHMP endorses the 
applicant’s proposal to have the same recommendations for Xigduo.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620505/2013 
Page 41/105 
 
  
  
Study D1691C00004 showed that there were no significant difference in AUCss0-24 or Css,av 
when dapagliflozin was administered as an oral 5 mg dose twice daily compared to a single daily 
dose of 10 mg. As expected, Css,max was lower and Css,min higher after administration of the 
lower dose twice daily. Similar exposure after administration of dapagliflozin 5 mg bid and 10 mg 
qd supports the proposed twice daily administration of Xigduo. 
In all studies supporting the clinical pharmacology package, dapagliflozin and metformin 
concentrations were analysed using sufficiently validated LC/MS/MS methods.  
The CHMP considers that the lack of PK-interaction between dapagliflozin and metformin has 
been sufficiently demonstrated and the pharmacokinetics of the new fixed dose combination 
(FDC) tablet has been studied to a sufficient extent.  
Pharmacodynamics 
With the current application only one study investigating the PD profile of the fixed dose 
combination has been provided. This is acceptable considering that both components in the 
combination are approved and well characterised. Data to support the mechanism of action of 
dapagliflozin was provided and assessed as part of the MAA for dapagliflozin. The mechanism of 
action for metformin is not entirely elucidated, but the compound is established in the treatment 
of diabetes. The complementary mechanisms of action for the two drugs form an adequate 
scientific basis for the fixed dose combination. 
Study D1691C00004 was performed in order to provide data in support of the 5 mg BID dosing 
of dapagliflozin since dapagliflozin as mono-component is dosed once daily. The PD parameters 
chosen are considered adequate for the purpose of the study and the study was well designed. 
The glucose excretion, adjusted for renal function (IRGRA), did not differ significantly between 
treatments. In addition, the effect of dapagliflozin on gastrointestinal glucose absorption was 
explored. No difference was observed between treatments. These findings support the proposed 
twice daily administration of Xigduo.  
No data on secondary pharmacological effects of the combination with dapagliflozin of metformin 
has been provided with the current application. This is found acceptable by the CHMP since the 
PD effects of both compounds have been well described and the relevant findings documented in 
the SmPCs of the mono-components. 
The relationship between the mean average exposure of dapagliflozin over 4-hours and the 
pharmacodynamic endpoints IRGRA and amount of glucose excreted over 24-hours was 
described by an Emax model. Based on this model, the 10 mg QD and 5 mg BID dose is 
expected to result in about 71% and 75 %, respectively of the maximum effect of dapagliflozin 
on 24 h urinary glucose excretion in healthy volunteers. For the endpoint IRGRA 54% and 56%, 
respectively, of the maximum effect is expected. These findings suggest that the two different 
administration schedules are expected to translate into a similar effect of dapagliflozin.  
No new data concerning PD interactions has been provided for the fixed dose combination. The 
interaction with diuretics for dapagliflozin is adequately described in the SmPC of Forxiga. The 
interaction between metformin and diuretics is included in the European CSP for metformin 
“Diuretics especially loop diuretics, may increase the risk of lactic acidosis due to their potential 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620505/2013 
Page 42/105 
 
  
  
to decrease renal function.” Therefore, at the CHMP request, the applicant updated Xigduo SmPC 
in accordance with metformin CSP. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Bioequivalence between Xigduo FDC and dapagliflozin and metformin administered has mono-
components has been demonstrated which is crucial in order to support the substitution 
indication and also to bridge from the monotherapy tablets used in the clinical studies.   
The effect of food on Xigduo FDC has been sufficiently evaluated to support the proposed dosage 
recommendations. Similar exposure after administration of dapagliflozin 5 mg bid and 10 mg qd 
supports the proposed twice daily administration of Xigduo.  
The CHMP considers that the lack of PK-interaction between dapagliflozin and metformin has 
been sufficiently demonstrated and the pharmacokinetics of the new fixed dose combination 
(FDC) tablet has been studied to a sufficient extent. 
The PD data provided within the current application is deemed sufficient to support that there are 
no relevant differences in the PD profile with 5 mg BID dosing of dapagliflozin compared to 10 
mg QD.

2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Efficacy has been demonstrated for dapagliflozin monotherapy, as assessed by improvements in 
HbA1c, weight loss and moderate lowering of blood pressure, in the clinical development 
programme that supported the initial dapagliflozin MAA (Forxiga). No dose finding studies were 
performed for the present FDC application since the doses applied for are covered by the already 
approved posology of Forxiga. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
The clinical programme supporting this submission consisted of six Phase III randomised, 
controlled, double-blind clinical studies, aimed to provide the following evidence to support 
efficacy:  
•  Dapagliflozin 5 mg BID as add-on therapy to metformin has glucose lowering efficacy 
(D1691C00003). 
•  Dapagliflozin 5 mg BID has consistent efficacy with dapagliflozin 10 mg QD, both 
coadministered with metformin BID (D1691C00003). 
•  Sustained effects during long-term administration of dapagliflozin and metformin 
(MB102014, D1690C00012). 
•  Noninferior efficacy of dapagliflozin 10 mg add-on to metformin versus a sulphonylurea 
plus metformin (D1690C00004). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620505/2013 
Page 44/105 
 
  
  
• 
Evidence that dapagliflozin improves glycaemic efficacy in subjects not adequately 
controlled on a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor plus metformin (D1690C00010), 
or insulin plus metformin (with or without an additional OAD) (D1690C00006). 
Study D1691C00003 is considered the key study supporting this application. Studies MB102014, 
D1690C00012, D1690C00006 and D1690C00004 were included in the original MAA for 
dapagliflozin. Additional long-term data from studies D1690C00012, D1690C00006 and 
D1690C00004 are included in the current submission. Study D1690C00010 investigates the use 
of dapagliflozin in combination with sitagliptin and includes a stratum with patients on metformin 
in combination with sitagliptin, relevant to this submission. 
Based upon the similar pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic characteristics of dapagliflozin, 
when administered as 5 mg BID or 10 mg QD (study D1691C00004), the expectation was that 
dapagliflozin administered twice daily would have consistent efficacy to once daily administration. 
Across the studies included in this submission, the range of metformin doses allowed was 1500 
mg/day to 3000 mg/day. The mean dose of open label metformin ranged from 1800 mg/day to 
2000 mg/day across all treatment groups, which conforms closely to the daily metformin doses 
of the different formulations of the FDC product. 
As the study design was similar across the study program, the main methodological features are 
presented in the following. 
Methods  
Study design 
All studies included a qualification/enrolment phase of up to 3 weeks, followed in some studies 
by a dose optimisation period in which background medications were added or stabilised. A 
placebo lead-in period that usually lasted 2 weeks was included in all of the studies with the 
exception of the combination with insulin study (D1690C00006). During the placebo lead-in 
period, subjects were given diet and lifestyle instruction according to local practices, and 
adherence to placebo was assessed.  
The studies included a short-term double-blind treatment period of 24 weeks, with the exception 
of studies D1691C00003 (BID add-on to metformin therapy) and D1690C00004 (active 
comparator study), which had ST periods of 16 weeks and 52 weeks, respectively. The primary 
endpoint was analysed at the end of the ST period. 
In all the studies (with the exception of D1691C00003), the ST treatment period was followed by 
LT extension treatment periods of at least 24 weeks duration. Placebo-treated subjects entering 
the LT extension treatment periods continued treatment with placebo.

short-term treatment period 
2 Study D1691C00003 did not include a long-term treatment period 
Rescue therapy 
In all studies, subjects who failed to meet pre-specified glycaemic targets (which became more 
stringent as the trials progressed) received rescue medication or were discontinued. In studies 
D1691C00003 (BID add-on to metformin study) and D1690C00004 (active comparator study), 
there was no rescue medication; in both studies, subjects with lack of glycaemic control based on 
FPG or HbA1c criteria were discontinued from the study. In study D1690C00006, the add-on to 
insulin study, insulin was uptitrated according to prespecified criteria in lieu of oral rescue 
therapy. 
Study Participants 
Males and females ≥ 18 years of age were eligible, and an upper age limit was imposed 
necessitated by the concomitant use of metformin. Similarly, subjects with mild to moderate 
renal impairment were included in the Phase 3 studies, but subjects with significant renal 
impairment were excluded in accordance with metformin labelling. Subjects with hepatic 
impairment or unstable cardiovascular (CV) disease, including Class III and IV heart failure, were 
also excluded from these studies. Phase 3 studies generally did not exclude subjects at advanced 
stages of T2DM, such as those with chronic complications of T2DM (retinopathy, neuropathy, 
mild nephropathy, or chronic CV disease). 
Eligibility criteria for the Phase 3 studies were selected to include inadequately controlled T2DM 
patients with a wide range of baseline HbA1c values. The lower threshold of the HbA1c inclusion 
criterion was ≥ 7.0% in 2 studies (MB102014, D1690C00010). Studies D1691C00003, 
D1690C00004 and D1690C00012 had a lower HbA1c threshold of ≥ 6.5%. HbA1c entry criteria 
were lower (≥ 6.5% to ≤ 8.5%) in study D1690C00012 in order to minimise the need for 
potentially confounding rescue therapy during the 2-year treatment period so that the effects on 
weight loss (primary endpoint) could be analysed. In D1690C00006, the combination study with 
insulin, the lower boundary of HbA1c that defined inclusion was ≥ 7.5% due to the increased risk 
of hypoglycaemia in this population. In all the studies, the upper boundary of HbA1c that defined 
inclusion generally ranged between ≤ 10.0% and ≤ 10.5%.

Treatments 
In study D1691C00003, 2.5 mg and 5 mg doses of dapagliflozin were administered BID and a 10 
mg dose of dapagliflozin was administered QD. 
The dapagliflozin doses of 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg were administered as once daily doses in 
studies MB102014 and D1690C00006. At the start of the 56-week long-term 2 (LT2) extension 
period of study D1690C00006, a prespecified switch of dapagliflozin 5 mg to 10 mg (dapagliflozin 
5/10 mg) was incorporated to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin 2.5 mg, 5/10 mg, 
and 10 mg. 
Study D1690C00004, the active comparator study, used a dose titration procedure (dapagliflozin 
2.5 mg → 5 mg → 10 mg) to match the gradual uptitration recommended for the active 
comparator, glipizide.  
Studies D1690C00012 and D1690C00010 included only the 10 mg dapagliflozin dose. 
Control groups 
The selection of control study medication was based on the study objectives. For control groups 
in the studies designed to demonstrate efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin as add-on combination 
therapy, placebo plus on-going background oral antidiabetic therapy was administered in 
accordance with local country requirements and was an accepted standard of clinical care.  
In study D1690C00004, dapagliflozin was compared to an active comparator, glipizide, on a 
background of metformin IR therapy. 
Background therapy 
Metformin IR was the background therapy used for the add-on studies D1691C00003, 
MB102014, D1690C00012, D1690C00004, and for Stratum 2 in study D1690C00010. 
In study D1690C00006, the background therapy used was insulin with a maximum of 2 OADs. 
Subjects on metformin therapy (either metformin IR or metformin extended release [XR]) were 
on at least 1500 mg/day or at the maximum tolerable dose for at least 8 weeks prior to 
enrolment. Subjects on other OAD medication were on at least half the maximum daily 
recommended dose for at least 8 weeks prior to enrolment. 
Objectives 
• 
Add-on to metformin versus placebo studies 
Study D1691C00003  
This was a 16-week, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, 
parallel group, Phase III trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of dapagliflozin 2.5 mg BID, 5 
mg BID, and 10 mg QD versus placebo in combination with metformin in subjects with T2DM 
who were inadequately controlled on metformin-IR monotherapy.  
The primary objective was to compare the change from baseline in HbA1c after 16 weeks of 
double-blind therapy, achieved with each of the 2 BID doses of dapagliflozin (2.5 mg BID and 5 
Assessment report

mg BID) co-administered with metformin versus placebo plus metformin. In one of the treatment 
groups, 10 mg dapagliflozin QD was co-administered with metformin as a measure of assay 
sensitivity. Efficacy and safety in the 10 mg QD dapagliflozin with metformin treatment group 
were compared only to placebo plus with metformin. No comparison was made between 10 mg 
QD dapagliflozin versus the BID doses of dapagliflozin. 
Study MB102014  
This was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, Phase 3 
trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 3 different doses of dapagliflozin (2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 
10 mg) in combination with metformin in subjects with T2DM who have inadequate glycaemic 
control on metformin alone. The exploratory efficacy objectives were to assess the glycaemic 
parameters, for each dose of dapagliflozin, in the long-term treatment period. To characterize 
the distributions of change from baseline in haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting plasma glucose 
(FPG), and body weight for each treatment group. 
The safety objective was to assess the safety and tolerability of each dose of dapagliflozin plus 
metformin after up to 102 weeks of oral administration of either double-blind or site- and 
subject-blinded treatment. 
Study D1690C00012  
This was an international, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-
group Phase 3 study with a 24-week short-term treatment period followed by a 78-week 
extension period to evaluate the effect of dapagliflozin 10 mg in combination with metformin on 
body weight in adult subjects with T2DM who have inadequate glycaemic control (HbA1c ≥ 6.5% 
and ≤ 8.5%) on metformin therapy alone. The primary objective was to evaluate the effect of 
dapagliflozin 10 mg daily in combination with metformin compared to placebo in combination 
with metformin on total body weight after 24 weeks.  
• 
Active comparator study 
Study D1690C00004  
This was an international, multicentre, randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, active-
controlled, Phase 3 study with a 52-week short-term treatment period followed by a 52-week 
extension period 1 (LT1) and a 104-week extension period 2 (LT2) to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of dapagliflozin as add-on therapy to metformin compared with glipizide (a sulphonylurea) 
plus metformin in adult subjects with T2DM who have inadequate glycaemic control (HbA1c > 
6.5% and ≤ 10.0%) on metformin therapy alone with 1500 mg/day or more. The primary 
objective was to examine whether the absolute change from baseline in HbA1c with dapagliflozin 
plus metformin was non-inferior to glipizide plus metformin after 52 weeks of double-blind 
treatment. Key secondary objectives were weight loss and hypoglycaemic events.

Combination therapy studies 
Study D1690C00010 
This was a 24-week, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, 
international Phase 3 study with a 24-week extension period to evaluate the safety and efficacy 
of dapagliflozin 10 mg daily in subjects with T2DM who had inadequate glycaemic control on a 
DPP-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin) alone or in combination with metformin. 
Subjects were stratified according to their use of metformin. Primary objective for the 24-week 
ST treatment period was the change from baseline in HbA1c.  
Study D1690C00006  
This was a 24-week international, randomised, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled 
Phase 3 study with an 80-week extension period to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
dapagliflozin therapy when added to the therapy of subjects with T2DM with inadequate 
glycaemic control (HbA1c ≥ 7.5% and ≤ 10.5%) on ≥ 30 IU insulin. The primary objective was 
to assess the efficacy of dapagliflozin 2.5 mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg compared to placebo as add-on 
therapy to insulin in improving glycaemic control in terms of the change in HbA1c from baseline 
to Week 24.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
HbA1c was the primary efficacy variable for five of the six Phase III studies included in this 
submission, and was analysed at 24 weeks in three studies; at 16 weeks in D1691C00003; and 
at 52 weeks in D1690C00004. Change from baseline body weight at 24 weeks was the primary 
efficacy variable in D1690C00012.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints included change in FPG; proportion of subjects achieving a 
therapeutic response of HbA1c < 7.0%; reduction in blood pressure; and change from baseline 
body weight. Secondary endpoints in D1690C00012 evaluated additional variables relating to 
weight, while change in HbA1c was assessed as an exploratory endpoint. 
Sample size 
Study D1691C00003 
The sample size for this study was selected to demonstrate a difference in the mean change in 
HbA1c from baseline to week 16 between one of the dapagliflozin treatment groups (2.5 mg BID 
and/or 5 mg BID) versus placebo co-administered with metformin. A review of variability 
estimates from BMS studies MB102013 and MB102014 suggested that the standard deviation 
(SD) associated with change in HbA1c from baseline to week 16 using LOCF was not more than 
0.97%. Since the overall Type I error had to be controlled for the two treatment comparisons 
using a Hochberg procedure, sample size estimation was based on the conservative assumption 
that one dose comparison could not reach statistical significance. In this situation, in order to 
detect a 0.5% difference in mean change from baseline in HbA1c between one of the 
dapagliflozin treatment groups (2.5 mg BID and/or 5 mg BID) versus placebo using a 2-sample 
t-test at a 0.025, two-sided significance level with 90% power, 95 evaluable subjects were

required per treatment group in the Full Analysis Set. If one assumed 3% of the subjects did not 
have a baseline and post-baseline efficacy measurement, 98 subjects per group (392 total 
subjects) were needed to be randomized. 
Further, if 40% of subjects failed to meet entry criteria for randomization (as seen in study 
MB102014), then approximately 654 subjects had to be enrolled. 
Study D1690C00012 
The sample size for this study was selected to demonstrate a difference in the mean change in 
body weight from baseline to week 24 between dapagliflozin in combination with metformin to 
metformin monotherapy (placebo as add-on therapy to metformin). An earlier study, MB102008, 
provided 12-week data for changes in body weight. The average, placebo corrected change in 
weight for the 10 mg dapagliflozin group was 1.3 kg at 12 weeks, and the SD across the 
dapagliflozin doses was 2.6 kg. It is anticipated that data over 24 weeks will demonstrate a 
greater weight reduction, 2 kg, as well as greater variability. Assuming an approximately 50% 
increase in variability, a SD of 4.0 kg is selected for this calculation. To detect a difference of 2 
kg between the treatment groups, 86 evaluable subjects per treatment group are required for 
90% power at a two-sided significance level of 0.050. Assuming that 5% of the randomized 
subjects will be excluded from the primary analysis because of missing data (eg, lost to follow-
up), at least 182 subjects total need to be randomized. 
Study D1690C00006 
Each pairwise treatment group comparison will be tested at a significance level of approximately 
0.019, according to Dunnett’s method, in order to maintain an overall type I error rate < 0.050 
for the primary objective. To detect a difference of 0.5% between each dapagliflozin group 
versus placebo for changes from baseline to week 24 in HbA1c, assuming a SD = 1.2%, and at a 
two-sided significance level of 0.019, 153 evaluable subjects are needed in each treatment group 
to provide 90% power. Assuming that 5% of the subjects will not be evaluable in the full analysis 
set, 161 subjects per treatment group (644 subjects total) are planned for randomization. 
Study D1690C00004 
To demonstrate non-inferiority of dapagliflozin in comparison with glipizide as add-on therapy to 
metformin for changes from baseline to week 52 in HbA1c within a non-inferiority margin of 
0.35%, assuming a standard deviation SD = 1.25%, and at a one-sided significance level of 
0.025, 280 evaluable per-protocol patients are needed in each treatment group to provide 
approximately 90% power (given a true difference of zero between the 2 treatment groups). 
Assuming a 25% exclusion rate from the per-protocol population, 373 patients per treatment 
group (746 patients total) are planned for randomisation. 
Study D1690C00010 
The sample size for this study was selected to demonstrate a difference in the mean change in 
HbA1c from baseline to week 24 between dapagliflozin and placebo within each of the two strata: 
patients on background therapy of sitagliptin monotherapy and patients on background therapy 
of sitagliptin plus metformin. To detect a difference of 0.5% between dapagliflozin versus placebo 
for change in HbA1c from baseline to week 24, assuming a standard deviation (SD) =1.1%, 103 
evaluable patients (full analysis set) for each treatment group within each stratum would provide 
Assessment report

>99% power for the analysis of the two strata combined at a significance level =0.050 or 90% 
power for the analysis of each stratum separately at a significance level =0.050. Assuming that 
5% of the patients will not be evaluable in the full analysis set, 108 patients per treatment group 
within each stratum (432 patients total) are planned for randomisation. 
In 6-month dapagliflozin studies, a SD of 1.1% was selected based upon the Phase II 
dapagliflozin study as well as historical data from other diabetes programs. 
Study MB102014 
With 129 subjects per treatment group with post-baseline measurements, there was 90% power 
to detect a difference in means of 0.5% between each dapagliflozin plus metformin treatment 
group and the placebo plus metformin group, assuming a standard deviation (SD) of 1.1%. 
Assuming that 5% of subjects did not have a post-baseline assessment, a total of 544 subjects 
(136 subjects per treatment group) needed to be randomized. 
Randomisation 
All six studies were randomized studies. Following the assessment of the inclusion/ exclusion 
criteria the subjects meeting the eligibility criteria were randomized to study treatment via an 
Interactive Web Response System (IWRS). In study D1691C00003 the subjects were stratified 
by HbA1c at randomisation (Stratum 1, Stratum 2) and in study D1690C00012 by gender. The 
randomization for each stratum was done within balanced blocks to ensure approximately equal 
numbers of subjects across the treatment groups within each stratum (when applicable). The 
IWRS allocated a randomisation code according to a pre-defined randomisation scheme. 
Blinding (masking) 
All investigational products (dapagliflozin 2.5 mg, 5 mg and matching dapagliflozin 2,5 / 5 mg 
placebo as well as dapagliflozin 10 mg and matching dapagliflozin 10 mg placebo) were identical 
in appearance, smell and taste. The dapagliflozin 2.5 mg and 5 mg tablets and the matching 
placebo were identical in size, whereas dapagliflozin 10 mg tablets and matching placebo were 
slightly larger. They were also packaged into identical bottles.  
Until the completion of the ST of the randomised period, the sponsor, the subjects, the 
investigators, the study monitors and any CRO handling data did not have access to the 
randomisation scheme, with the exception of the IWRS company, the CRO designated to pack 
the investigational products and the drug safety department at Bristol-Myers Squibb and 
AstraZeneca.  
During the LT extension period, investigators, subjects, and study monitors continued to be 
blinded until completion of the extension phase without any knowledge of the treatment codes, 
except for cases of medical emergencies.

Statistical methods 
Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) was used to analyse the primary and all continuous secondary 
endpoints. A modified logistic regression was used for dichotomous secondary endpoints (e.g. 
proportion of responders). The primary endpoint in each study was evaluated by comparing the 
difference in the adjusted mean change from baseline between the dapagliflozin treatment 
group(s) and the comparator group(s), adjusting for multiple treatment comparisons in most 
cases with Dunnett’s method (D1691C00003 being the exception). In D1691C00003, the 
Hochberg procedure was used to control the overall Type I error in the groups (2.5 mg BID and 
5 mg BID) comparisons versus placebo for the primary efficacy variable. 
Statistical testing of secondary efficacy endpoints proceeded in a sequential manner using 
alpha = 0.05 tests for only those treatment groups found to be statistically significant in the 
primary efficacy analysis (an exception to this rule is study D1690C00012 where Hochberg’s 
method was used). For each study, the number and order of secondary endpoints was specified 
prior to breaking of the blind.  
Missing HbA1c data from the ST period were handled in main analyses using LOCF (last 
observation carried forward) methodology, excluding data obtained after rescue therapy (except 
D1690C00004 and D1691C00003 where no rescue therapy was used and D1690C00012 where 
the primary efficacy variable was weight change). Robustness of study conclusions was evaluated 
with respect to the primary endpoint through sensitivity analyses by (i) including versus 
excluding data after rescue therapy, (ii) using observed values versus LOCF values, (iii) 
employing a longitudinal model versus visit specific analyses, and/or (iv) excluding major 
protocol violators versus including all randomized and treated subjects. Generally, confirmatory 
analyses for the ST period of studies were based on LOCF values while exploratory analyses from 
the ST plus LT periods were based on observed values. 
For D1690C00006, a post-hoc analysis of the primary and key secondary endpoints for ST and 
ST plus LT periods was performed on subjects from stratum 2 who took dapagliflozin or placebo 
in combination with insulin plus the OAD of metformin alone. The methodology was similar to 
that described in the study D1690C00006 ST and LT Statistical Analysis Plans (SAPs), with the 
exception that strata as a fixed effect was removed from the ANCOVA and logistic regression 
models.   
Long-term efficacy and safety of dapagliflozin was evaluated over the entire duration of the ST 
combined with the LT treatment period (and extension period if applicable). No p-values were 
calculated for LT efficacy analyses as they were considered exploratory. Analyses were based on 
observed data without application of LOCF, to avoid carrying forward data over long periods of 
time. For continuous endpoints, a longitudinal repeated measures model was used.

Baseline data 
The six Phase III studies enrolled a wide range of subjects, and the demographic and baseline 
characteristics were representative of T2DM patients with inadequate glycaemic control in real 
world practice. Across these studies, the mean age ranged from 52.7 years to 60.8 years, and 
22.8% subjects were ≥ 65 years of age. The proportion of males (51.7%) was similar to the 
proportion of females (48.3%). 
The regions of Europe (59.0%; D1691C00003, D1690C00012, D1690C00004, D1690C00010 and 
D1690C00006); Latin America (23.4%; MB102014, D1690C00004 and D1690C00010); and 
North America (15.2%; MB102014, D1690C00010 and D1690C00006); and South Africa (2.4%; 
D1691C00003) were well represented across the six Phase 3 studies. The majority of subjects 
across the studies were White (86%), with 4% each of Black/African American and Asian 
subjects. Hispanic/Latino ethnicity was reported for 16% of the subjects. Although some regions 
and races were less well represented, the effects of dapagliflozin are expected to be applicable to 
all regional populations as available data suggest that SGLT2 polymorphisms while apparent, are 
infrequent across racial and ethnic groups, and are not known to alter the pharmacodynamic 
action of dapagliflozin. 
While subjects ≥ 65 years were well represented in these studies, there were relatively few 
subjects ≥ 75 years old (2%; 67 subjects). The Forxiga SmPC does not recommend initiation of 
therapy in patients aged ≥ 75 years.  
The duration of T2DM was generally similar across the studies (range of means: 4.80 years to 
6.55 years), except for D1690C00006 where duration of T2DM for the overall study population 
was longer (range of means: 13.13 years to 14.15 years).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620505/2013 
Page 53/105 
 
  
  
Across the studies, the range of mean baseline HbA1c was 7.16% to 8.16%, and the range of 
mean baseline FPG was 148.0 mg/dL to 169.3 mg/dL [8.21 mmol/L to 9.40 mmol/L]. 
D1690C00006 had higher baseline HbA1c (~8.5%) and FPG levels (range of means: 
170.6 mg/dL to 185.4 mg/dL [9.47 mmol/L to 10.29 mmol/L]) for the overall study population 
because of the higher HbA1c inclusion threshold (≥ 7.5%). The range of mean BMI (body mass 
index) was 31.22 kg/m2 to 33.41 kg/m2, representative of the T2DM population. 
The Phase III studies included subjects with mild or moderate renal impairment (baseline 
estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of ≥ 60 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 
≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively). There was a variation in exclusion criteria for renal 
impairment across the dapagliflozin studies, and eligibility was usually determined before the 
baseline visit. The small percentage of subjects with baseline values indicating moderate renal 
impairment did not constitute violations to the study inclusion criteria. 
Numbers analysed 
In general, discontinuation rates were low (5-10 %) in the short-term parts of the studies where 
rescue therapy was allowed with no gross differences observed between actively treated groups 
and placebo. Discontinuation rates were higher in the active comparator study (23 % for SU and 
21 % for dapagliflozin) as no rescue medication was allowed. In studies where rescue therapy 
was applied, rescue rates were higher in the placebo treated groups.

HbA1c change from baseline 
Statistically significant adjusted mean changes from baseline HbA1c were achieved at Week 16 
(LOCF) for the dapagliflozin 5 mg BID treatment group (-0.65% [CI: -0.77, -0.53]), and for the 
dapagliflozin 2.5 mg BID treatment group (-0.52%). Consistent with the results achieved with 
dapagliflozin 5 mg BID, treatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg QD resulted in an adjusted mean 
change from baseline HbA1c of -0.59% [CI: -0.70, -0.47]. The placebo group showed an 
adjusted mean change from baseline in HbA1c of -0.30%. The range of mean baseline HbA1c 
level across treatment groups was 7.71% to 7.94%.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620505/2013 
Page 56/105 
 
  
  
 
Statistically significant placebo-corrected mean reductions in HbA1c at Week 16 were achieved 
for dapagliflozin 5 mg BID (-0.35%) and dapagliflozin 2.5 mg BID (-0.22%). The 
placebo-corrected mean reduction in HbA1c for dapagliflozin 10 mg QD (-0.29%; nominal 
p-value < 0.05 [CI: -0.45, -0.12]), was consistent with the placebo-corrected mean reductions in 
HbA1c achieved in the dapagliflozin 5 mg BID treatment group (-0.35% [CI: -0.52, -0.18]).  
Other glycaemic variables 
Statistically significant placebo-corrected mean reductions in FPG were observed (-15.7 mg/dL 
[-0.87 mmol/L] and -16.7 mg/dL [-0.93 mmol/L] at Week 1, and -10.4 mg/dL [-0.58 mmol/L] 
and -15.3 mg/dL [-0.85 mmol/L] at Week 16, for dapagliflozin 2.5 mg BID and 5 mg BID, 
respectively). FPG reductions for dapagliflozin 5 mg BID were consistent for dapagliflozin 10 mg 
QD (placebo-corrected mean reductions of -17.5 mg/dL [-0.97 mmol/L] at Week 1, and 
-10.0 mg/dL [-0.56 mmol/L] at Week 16).  
Average FPG levels achieved after 16 weeks treatment with dapagliflozin 2.5 mg BID and 5 mg 
BID were 135.2 mg/dL [7.50 mmol/L] and 131.3 mg/dL [7.29 mmol/L], respectively; this was 
not achieved in the placebo group (FPG of 147.7 mg/dL [8.20 mmol/L]). Overall the above 
results were consistent with FPG reductions at Week 24 reported previously in MB102014 and 
D1690C00012. 
Treatment with dapagliflozin 2.5 mg BID and 5 mg BID led to a statistically significantly higher 
placebo-corrected proportion of subjects achieving a therapeutic glycaemic response, defined as 
HbA1c < 7.0%, (12.2% and 16.8%, respectively). This is consistent with MB102014, where a 
higher proportion of subjects treated with dapagliflozin achieved a therapeutic response 
compared with placebo. 
Weight variables 
Treatment with dapagliflozin 2.5 mg BID and 5 mg BID coadministered with metformin achieved 
statistically significant placebo-corrected mean reductions from baseline body weight (-1.62 kg 
[-1.82%] and –1.88 kg [-2.18%], respectively; corresponding mean reductions for treatment 
with dapagliflozin 10 mg QD were -1.48 kg (-1.73%).  
Additional data on efficacy of dapagliflozin add-on to metformin therapy (MB102014 and 
D1690C00012) 
Both pivotal placebo-controlled add-on to metformin studies were included in the initial 
dapagliflozin MAA submission package. 
During the 24-week placebo-controlled study MB102014, treatment with 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 
10 mg dapagliflozin add-on to metformin resulted in statistically significant placebo-corrected 
mean reductions from baseline HbA1c (-0.38%, -0.41% and -0.54%, respectively).  
In study D1690C00012, treatment with dapagliflozin 10 mg add-on to metformin resulted in a 
placebo-corrected mean reduction in HbA1c of -0.28%; this comparatively modest reduction at 
Week 24 was expected as ~38% of subjects had a mean baseline HbA1c value of < 7.0%. 
Statistically significant and clinically relevant FPG reductions at Week 24 were also reported in 
MB102014 (placebo-corrected mean reductions of –11.8 mg/dL [-0.65 mmol/L], -15.5 mg/dL 
[-0.86 mmol/L] and -17.5 mg/dL [-0.97 mmol/L] for dapagliflozin 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg, 
Assessment report

respectively). Average FPG levels were 136.2 mg/dL [7.56 mmol/L] at 24 weeks in the 
dapagliflozin 10 mg group in MB102014. Clinically relevant FPG reductions at Week 24 were also 
reported in D1690C00012 (placebo-corrected mean reductions of -17.1 mg/dL [-0.95 mmol/L] 
for dapagliflozin 10 mg).  
Additionally in MB102014, a statistically significant placebo-corrected higher proportion of 
subjects achieved a therapeutic response of HbA1c < 7.0% (11.7% and 14.7% for dapagliflozin 
5 mg and 10 mg, respectively). 
In MB102014 and D1690C00012, treatment with dapagliflozin add-on to metformin resulted in 
statistically significant placebo-corrected mean reductions in body weight of approximately 2 kg. 
The majority of the weight loss in D1690C00012 was attributable to a statistically significant 
placebo-corrected mean reduction in total body fat mass of -1.48 kg, as measured by dual 
energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA); a statistically significant placebo-corrected mean reduction 
of -1.5 cm in waist circumference was also achieved. 
Long-term efficacy of dapagliflozin add-on to metformin therapy (MB102014 and D1690C00012) 
In MB102014, placebo-corrected mean reductions in HbA1c achieved at Week 24 were 
maintained until Week 102 in the dapagliflozin treatment groups in a dose dependent manner 
(-0.50%, -0.60% and -0.80% for dapagliflozin 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg, respectively; excluding 
data after rescue therapy). Similarly for D1690C00012, subjects in the dapagliflozin treatment 
group showed a placebo-corrected mean reduction of HbA1c from baseline to Week 24 that was 
maintained at Week 50 (-0.40%; excluding data after rescue therapy). 
In MB102014, the placebo-corrected proportions of subjects who were rescued or discontinued 
for lack of efficacy was -7.0%, -16.1%, and -16.0% in the dapagliflozin 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg 
treatment groups, respectively, at Week 102. 
In MB102014, differences in total body weight achieved at Week 24 in the dapagliflozin 
treatment groups were maintained until Week 102 (placebo-corrected mean reductions of 
-2.46 kg, -3.06 kg and -3.10 kg in the dapagliflozin 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg treatment groups, 
respectively; including data after rescue therapy).  
In D1690C00012, further mean reductions in total body weight were observed from Week 24 to 
Week 50; placebo-corrected changes from baseline (including data after rescue therapy) at 
Week 50 were –2.37 kg in the dapagliflozin treatment group.

Non-inferior efficacy of dapagliflozin add-on to metformin versus a sulphonylurea (glipizide) plus 
metformin (D1690C00004)  
In the active comparator study D1690C00004, dapagliflozin add-on to metformin was compared 
to glipizide plus metformin. This study included a dose titration scheme in accordance with the 
dosing recommendations for glipizide. At the end of the titration period, 87% of subjects had 
been titrated to the maximum dapagliflozin dose (10 mg), and 73% to the maximum glipizide 
dose (20 mg). This study was part of the initial dapagliflozin MAA submission package. 
The mean reduction from baseline in HbA1c at Week 52 (LOCF) was -0.52% for both treatment 
groups: dapagliflozin (titrated to 10 mg) add-on to metformin, and glipizide (titrated to 20 mg) 
plus metformin. This decrease was statistically significantly non-inferior for dapagliflozin 
compared to glipizide (non-inferiority margin = 0.35%, with 95% confidence interval completely 
below the pre-defined margin).  
Subjects in both treatment groups also showed a mean reduction in FPG from baseline to 
Week 52 of approximately -20 mg/dL [-1.11 mmol/L]. Although a higher percentage of subjects 
treated with glipizide achieved a therapeutic glycaemic response (HbA1c ≤ 6.5%), 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620505/2013 
Page 59/105 
 
  
  
 
discontinuations due to lack of glycaemic control were numerically more frequent in the glipizide 
group (3.6%, versus 0.2% for the dapagliflozin group).  
A secondary efficacy assessment in this study was a comparison between dapagliflozin and 
glipizide of the proportion of subjects reporting at least one episode of hypoglycaemia over 
52 weeks. There were ten times as many subjects in the glipizide group (40.8%) who 
experienced at least one event of hypoglycaemia compared with the dapagliflozin group (3.5%); 
the difference was statistically significant (p < 0.0001).  
Treatment with dapagliflozin resulted in statistically significant mean weight loss from baseline of 
-3.22 kg versus mean weight gain of +1.44 kg with glipizide (Week 52; LOCF), together with a 
statistically significant mean decrease in waist circumference of -2.33 cm with dapagliflozin 
compared with a mean increase of +1.09 cm with glipizide. The divergence in these effects 
between dapagliflozin and glipizide on weight was maintained during the LT extension treatment 
period up to Week 104.  
Long-term efficacy of dapagliflozin add-on to metformin versus a sulphonylurea (glipizide) plus 
metformin (D1690C00004)  
Persistent glycaemic benefits were observed with dapagliflozin during the LT extension treatment 
period up to Week 104, whereas the magnitude of effect achieved with glipizide was reduced 
from the HbA1c reductions observed at Week 52.  
Mean HbA1c reductions for dapagliflozin and glipizide observed at Week 104 were -0.32% and 
-0.14%, respectively. Mean FPG reductions achieved at Week 52 were also maintained at 
Week 104 with dapagliflozin (-20.2 mg/dL [-1.12 mmol/L]), but not with glipizide (-12.2 mg/dL 
[-0.68 mmol/L]).  
The proportion of subjects discontinuing due to lack of glycaemic control was lower with 
dapagliflozin (14.5%) compared with glipizide (21.6%). Thus treatment with dapagliflozin add-on 
to metformin demonstrated glycaemic efficacy maintained up to 104 weeks compared with 
glipizide plus metformin. 
The mean reduction in body weight achieved from baseline to Week 52 was stable to Week 104 
(-3.70 kg) for the dapagliflozin group. In contrast, subjects in the glipizide group showed an 
increase in mean body weight from baseline to Week 52 and also at Week 104 (+1.36 kg).  
Efficacy of dapagliflozin in combination with a DPP-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin) plus metformin 
(D1690C00010)  
Stratum 2 of study D1690C00010 assessed the efficacy of dapagliflozin 10 mg in combination 
with the DPP-4 inhibitor sitagliptin plus metformin in subjects who were inadequately controlled 
on sitagliptin 100 mg plus ≥ 1500 mg/day metformin. 
Subjects treated with dapagliflozin 10 mg in combination with sitagliptin plus metformin (Stratum 
2) showed a statistically significant placebo-corrected mean reduction in HbA1c (-0.40%) from 
baseline to Week 24 (LOCF), which was consistent with the HbA1c mean reduction achieved in 
the overall study D1690C00010 population (-0.48%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620505/2013 
Page 60/105 
 
  
  
Statistically significant placebo-corrected mean reductions in FPG from baseline to Week 24 
(LOCF) were also achieved (-29.18 mg/dL [-1.62 mmol/L] for Stratum 2), which were again 
consistent with the overall study population results (-27.92 mg/dL [-1.55 mmol/L]).  
Additionally, the placebo-corrected proportion of subjects achieving a therapeutic glycaemic 
response, defined as HbA1c < 7.0% at Week 24, was 8.9% (nominal p-value was < 0.05).  
Statistically significant placebo-corrected mean decreases in total body weight from baseline to 
Week 24 (LOCF) were also achieved (-1.87 kg for Stratum 2), consistent with the overall 
population results (-1.89 kg). These effects were maintained during the LT extension treatment 
period up to 48 weeks. 
Long-term efficacy of dapagliflozin in combination with a DPP-4 inhibitor (sitagliptin) plus 
metformin (D1690C00010)  
Reductions in HbA1c achieved at Week 24 were maintained or improved at Week 48 for subjects 
receiving dapagliflozin in combination with sitagliptin plus metformin (Stratum 2), with 
placebo-corrected mean reductions of –0.59% (excluding data after rescue therapy), and –
0.58% (including data after rescue therapy).  
The placebo-corrected mean change in total body weight observed at Week 24 was also 
maintained or improved at 48 weeks (-2.07 kg, excluding data after rescue therapy; and 
-2.58 kg, including data after rescue therapy; Stratum 2). 
Efficacy of dapagliflozin in combination with insulin with or without other OADs, including 
metformin (D1690C00006)  
Study D1690C00006 assessed the efficacy of dapagliflozin 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg in 
combination with insulin, with or without OADs; a post-hoc subgroup analysis was performed on 
the subset of subjects who received dapagliflozin or placebo in combination with insulin plus 
metformin. This study was part of the initial dapagliflozin MAA submission. 
For the post-hoc subgroup analysis of subjects who received dapagliflozin in combination with 
insulin plus metformin, judged at a nominal two-sided alpha-level of 0.05, placebo-corrected 
mean reductions in HbA1c of -0.44%, -0.59% and -0.61% were achieved for dapagliflozin 
2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg treatment groups, respectively, which were consistent with the results 
of the overall population.  
Long-term efficacy of dapagliflozin in combination with insulin with or without other OADs, 
including metformin (D1690C00006)  
For the subgroup of subjects who received dapagliflozin in combination with insulin plus 
metformin, glycaemic efficacy was maintained until 104 weeks in all dapagliflozin treatment 
groups, with placebo-corrected HbA1c mean reductions of –0.88% for the dapagliflozin 
5 mg/10 mg and dapagliflozin 10 mg treatment groups.

Ancillary analyses 
•  Dapagliflozin effect on blood pressure 
Blood pressure reductions were expected due to the mode of action of SGLT2 inhibition, which is 
associated with a mild osmotic diuretic effect. Treatment with dapagliflozin add-on to metformin 
therapy resulted in moderate reductions in systolic and diastolic blood pressures (MB102014, 
D1690C00012 and D1691C00003). Similar reductions were achieved in combination with 
sitagliptin plus metformin (Stratum 2 of D1690C00010); or in combination with insulin plus 
metformin, with or without other OADs (D1690C00006).

Notes 
A Longitudinal repeated measures analysis over time model was used for 
the analysis of the 102-week data 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
•  Comparison of results in subpopulations 
The pooled data presented in the initial dapagliflozin MAA remain the most comprehensive data 
to describe efficacy results in the subpopulations and is more relevant than data from individual 
studies within this submission, as data from the individual studies presented here would be 
based on smaller numbers of subjects and therefore, may show variability in the subgroup 
categories. It is important to note that data from studies included in this submission (except 
D1691C00003 and D1690C00010) are also included in the pooled data presented in the initial 
dapagliflozin MAA.   
Subgroup analyses in studies D1691C00003 and D1690C00010 were generally consistent with 
results in the overall pool in the initial dapagliflozin MAA.  
The subgroup analyses show that no dose adjustment is required based on age, gender, race or 
body weight. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
No new data have been submitted with the current application.  
•  Use in patients with renal or hepatic impairment:  
The efficacy of dapagliflozin is, due to its mechanism of action, dependent on renal function, and 
efficacy is reduced in patients who have moderate renal impairment and likely absent in patients 
with severe renal impairment. Therefore the dapagliflozin/metformin FDC should not be used in 
patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (CrCl < 60mL/min, or eGFR 
< 60mL/min/1.73 m2). Further to this, metformin is contraindicated in patients with moderate to 
severe renal impairment due to an increased risk of lactic acidosis. No dosage adjustment is 
recommended for patients with mild renal impairment.  
Similarly, as the risk of lactic acidosis associated with metformin is increased in patients with 
impaired hepatic function, the dapagliflozin/metformin FDC should not be used in patients with 
hepatic impairment; this recommendation is consistent with the contraindications for metformin 
monotherapy. 
•  Use in patients at risk for volume depletion, hypotension and/or electrolyte 
imbalances:  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620505/2013 
Page 79/105 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Due to its mechanism of action, dapagliflozin increases diuresis, leading to a modest decrease in 
blood pressure, which may be more pronounced in patients with high blood glucose 
concentrations. Thus, the dapagliflozin/metformin FDC is not recommended for use in patients 
receiving loop diuretics or who are volume depleted (e.g., due to acute illness, such as 
gastrointestinal illness). Caution should also be exercised in patients for whom a 
dapagliflozin-induced drop in blood pressure could pose a risk, such as patients with known CV 
disease, patients on anti-hypertensive therapy with a history of hypotension, or elderly patients. 
Careful monitoring of volume status (physical examination, blood pressure measurements and 
laboratory tests including haematocrit) and electrolytes is recommended for patients receiving 
the dapagliflozin/metformin FDC, especially during intercurrent conditions that may lead to 
volume depletion. Temporary interruption of treatment with the dapagliflozin/metformin FDC is 
recommended for patients who develop volume depletion until the depletion is corrected.  
•  Use in elderly patients (≥ 65 years):  
Because metformin is eliminated in part by the kidney, and because elderly patients are more 
likely to have decreased renal function, the dapagliflozin/metformin FDC should be used with 
caution as age increases. Monitoring of renal function is necessary to prevent 
metformin-associated lactic acidosis, particularly in the elderly. Risk of volume depletion with 
dapagliflozin should also be taken into account. Due to the limited therapeutic experience with 
dapagliflozin in patients ≥ 75 years, initiation of the dapagliflozin/metformin FDC in this 
population is not recommended. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
No dose finding studies were performed which is acceptable considering that the doses applied 
for in this application is already approved. Sufficient data has been provided with the PK/PD 
study D1691C00004 to conclude that the 5 mg BID dapagliflozin dose is bioequivalent to the 10 
mg QD dose and that comparable pharmacodynamic effects are achieved with both doses.  
In the clinical study program for dapagliflozin, the metformin doses were not fixed but ranged 
between 1500 to 3000 mg per day across the study program. The mean dose ranged from 1800 
to 2000 mg which support that the majority of patients were treated with doses of metformin 
corresponding to the doses proposed for the fixed dose formulation. 
A similar study design was applied across the study program and the overall study design was 
adequate and in line with the scientific guidelines. The use of rescue therapy was pre-defined and 
adequate. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were adequate and would enrol a population 
representative for the target population, i.e. patients with inadequate metabolic control on 
metformin where dapagliflozin treatment is adequate. It should be noted that the lower HbA1c 
limit for inclusion differ between studies and that the limit was relatively low (≥  6.5%) in three 
of the studies. 
The choice of primary and secondary endpoints in the studies were adequate and in line with the 
scientific guidelines. Statistical methods applied were adequate. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620505/2013 
Page 80/105 
 
  
  
All studies investigated the dapagliflozin 10 mg QD dose. In addition, study D1691C00003 
included one group treated with dapagliflozin 5 mg BID. In all studies, the inclusion criteria 
stated that patients should be on their maximally tolerated dose of metformin or a minimum 
dose of 1500 mg. 
The study program is considered adequately designed and conducted in order to support the 
proposed fixed dose combination. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the original MAA for dapagliflozin clinical data supporting the combination of dapagliflozin 10 
mg QD with metformin was presented and information on this combination is included in the 
SmPC of Forxiga. The current application is for a fixed dose combination with metformin. As 
metformin is dosed twice daily, the main objective from an efficacy point of view is to provide 
clinical data to support that dapagliflozin 5 mg BID treatment effect is comparable to the 10 mg 
QD dosing regimen. Such data were provided with study DC1690C00003.  
The clinical studies provided with this submission included more than 1,500 patients treated with 
metformin in combination with dapagliflozin and more than 1,000 patients treated with 
metformin in combination with placebo or active comparator. 
Overall, the subjects enrolled are representative of the target population for the fixed dose 
combination. European patients were well represented in the submitted studies. The study 
groups were well balanced with regards to baseline characteristics within the studies. Due to the 
differences in HbA1c inclusion criteria the mean HbA1c differed between studies, which have to 
be taken into account when assessing the primary outcome of the studies. In general, there were 
very few patients with impaired renal function included in the studies, thus exclusion criteria 
were complied with. 
In general, discontinuation rates were low in the short-term parts of the studies with no gross 
differences observed between actively treated groups and placebo/active comparator. In studies 
where rescue therapy was applied, rescue rates were higher in the placebo treated groups. 
In study D1690C00003, a comparable placebo-corrected effect on lowering of HbA1c was 
observed with the 5 mg BID (-0.35 %) and 10 mg OD dosing (-0.29 %). The placebo-corrected 
HbA1c reduction was lower than previously observed in study MB MB102014. The Applicant has 
provided adequate arguments for this finding, one important issue being the higher proportion of 
subjects with a baseline HbA1c < 7.0%. The outcome was comparable to that observed in study 
D1690C00012 where the baseline HbA1c was even lower than in study D1690C00003. The small 
difference observed between the 2.5 mg BID treated group (-0.22 %) and the 5 mg BID group 
may be explained by the overall lower HbA1c reduction figures.  
The primary outcome was supported by the secondary glycaemic endpoints. The effect on HbA1c 
lowering was observed within 12 weeks and no further reduction was seen at 16 weeks. Notably 
the placebo group showed a rather large response. Comparable weight reduction of about 1.5 kg 
was observed in all dapagliflozin treated groups.  
In study MB102014, a weak dose-response was observed with the most prominent effect in 
patients treated with 10 mg dapagliflozin daily. A less marked effect was observed in study 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620505/2013 
Page 81/105 
 
  
  
D1690C00012, which could be explained by the low HbA1c at baseline. Secondary endpoints 
results supported the primary endpoint. These data were assessed as part of the original MAA for 
dapagliflozin and formed the basis for the inclusion of information on the free combination of 
depagliflozin and metformin in the Forxiga SmPC. Long-term data up to 102 weeks of treatment 
in study MB102014 show that the glucose-lowering effect of dapagliflozin is maintained over 
time. Fewer patients in the actively treated groups discontinued due to lack of efficacy compared 
to placebo.  
The data from the active comparator study D1690C00004 were assessed within the original MAA 
for dapagliflozin. After 52 weeks of treatment, non-inferiority for dapagliflozin vs glipizide could 
be shown, both treatments given in combination with metformin. Hypoglycaemia was less 
common in the dapagliflozin treated group. At 104 weeks, the HbA1c reduction was more 
pronounced in the dapagliflozin treated group compared to glipizide. Furthermore, the weight 
reduction observed at 52 weeks was maintained at 104 weeks in the dapagliflozin treated group. 
In study D1690C00010, which included a stratum with patients on dual therapy with sitagliptin 
and metformin, the addition of dapagliflozin resulted in a clinically relevant and statistically 
significant reduction in HbA1c. These data have also been assessed within the on-going Forxiga 
variation EMEA/H/C/2322/II/03. It was concluded that balanced information regarding the study 
could be included in the SmPC section 5.1. Long-term data indicate a maintained and clinically 
relevant effect of dapagliflozin over the 48 week period. 
In study D1690C00006, clinically relevant HbA1c reductions were observed with the three 
dapagliflozin doses investigated, with statistically more responders achieving a HbA1c < 7.0% 
observed in groups treated with 5mg and 10 mg dapagliflozin. Results comparable with those of 
the overall population were observed in the subgroup treated with the triple combination 
insulin/dapagliflozin/metformin. The long-term data show that efficacy was maintained over the 
104 week period. These data were assessed within the original MAA and supported the 
combination of dapagliflozin with insulin. 
The blood pressure lowering effect of dapagliflozin was well documented in the original MAA. 
With regards to special populations, no new data have been provided. The restrictions and 
recommendations regarding the use of the dapagliflozin/metformin FDC in patients with renal or 
hepatic impairment, elderly patients and patients at risk of volume depletion, hypotension and/or 
electrolyte imbalances are based on data for the two components and these data are adequately 
reflected in the SmPC section 4.3 and 4.4. 
No new subgroup analyses in pooled data have been provided with the current submission. The 
subgroup analysis assessed with the MAA for dapagliflozin show that no dose adjustment is 
required based on age, gender, race or body weight.  
Based on the submitted data the CHMP considers that the effect of dapagliflozin as add-on to 
metformin has been adequately shown. The fixed dose combination should only be used when 
dapagliflozin is to be given as add-on in patients already on metformin treatment, fact that is 
clearly described in sections 4.1 and 4.2 of the SmPC.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The clinical program carried out in order to support of the dapagliflozin and metformin FDC 
application is considered adequate. The use of dapagliflozin and metformin as free combination is 
already approved.  
In the placebo controlled studies treatment with 2.5 mg, 5 mg and 10 mg dapagliflozin add on to 
metformin resulted in statistically significant placebo corrected mean reductions from baseline 
HbA1c at week 24. These results were supported by the clinically relevant FPG reductions and 
statistically significant placebo corrected mean reductions in body weight of approximately 2 kg. 
Long-term data up to 102 weeks of treatment show that the glucose-lowering effect of 
dapagliflozin is maintained over time. 
A comparable placebo-corrected clinical effect on lowering of HbA1c was observed with the 5 mg 
BID (-0.35 %) and 10 mg QD dosing (-0.29 %) which along with the similar exposure shown 
after administration of dapagliflozin 5 mg BID and 10 mg QD supports the proposed twice daily 
administration of Xigduo. 
The indication clearly states that Xigduo is to be used – either when dapagliflozin is to be given 
as add-on to metformin (although combination with additional OADs is possible) or as 
substitution therapy. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Safety data from the ST treatment periods for studies MB102014, D1690C00004, D1690C00006 
and D1690C00012 were already extensively reviewed in the initial dapagliflozin MAA. In order to 
provide a comprehensive overview of all relevant data supporting the safety of LT administration 
of dapagliflozin add on to metformin, the analyses of safety included in Xigduo application focus 
on the latest available data for each study (i.e., all data from the ST + LT treatment periods, and 
not only the LT extension periods, of previously reported studies). For D1690C00010, ST + LT 
data (48 weeks) are presented for the overall study population and for Stratum 2 (sitagliptin plus 
metformin). For D1691C00003, only ST data are available (16 weeks). All analyses include data 
after the initiation of rescue therapy, except for studies D1691C00003 and D1690C00004, as 
rescue therapy was not available in these studies. For D1690C00006, a post hoc analysis of the 
safety data was performed on a subgroup of the stratum of subjects with OADs who took 
dapagliflozin in combination with insulin, or placebo plus insulin, with the OAD of metformin 
alone. 
Patient exposure 
In the six Phase III studies included in this submission, 3200 subjects were randomised and 
treated with at least one dose of study medication. Of the 3200 randomised subjects, 1562 
received dapagliflozin plus metformin (some in combination with sitagliptin or insulin), 478 
received dapagliflozin (plus sitagliptin alone, or in combination with insulin with or without other 
OADs [other than metformin alone]), and 1160 received control/comparator. The database for 
studying the safety of the dapagliflozin/metformin immediate release (IR) fixed dose combination 
(FDC) in subjects with T2DM is considered sufficient. Data concerning subjects ≥ 65 years is

limited. There was some variation across the studies in exclusion criteria for renal impairment. In 
most of the studies, eligibility was based on CrCl > 60 mL/min. Patients with severe renal 
impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/ 1.73 m2) and cardiac failure, NYHA class III and IV, have been 
excluded from studies.  
Overall, the subjects enrolled were representative of the proposed target population, and were 
considered to be suitable to assess the safety of dapagliflozin add-on to metformin therapy.  
The number of patients exposed to dapagliflozin at the recommended dosages (10 mg QD) in 
combination with metformin ≥1500 mg is considered sufficient since 1,252 patients have been 
exposed, among these are 100 patients exposed to dapagliflozin 5 mg BID in combination with 
metformin ≥1500 mg. Overall, 1,053 patients have been exposed to dapagliflozin (10 mg QD) in 
combination with metformin ≥1500 mg for at least 48 weeks, among these are 737 patients 
exposed for at least 102 weeks. The extent of exposure to open-label metformin was generally 
similar to the extent of exposure to double-blind study medication. 
Cumulative exposure and mean duration of exposure were comparable across treatment groups 
in 4 of the 6 studies, and slightly shorter in the placebo group than in the dapagliflozin groups in 
2 of the studies (MB102014 and D1690C00006). 
Adverse events 
In study D1691C00003, most common AEs at PT level in the BID 5 mg dapagliflozin/metformin 
IR FDC group were creatinine renal clearance decreased 3.0% (vs 4.0% in placebo), back pain 
3.0% (vs 2.0% in placebo), vulvovaginal candidiasis 3.0% (vs. 0 in placebo), blood creatinine 
phosphokinase increased 3.0% (vs. 1.0% in placebo), upper respiratory tract infection 2.0 % (vs 
1.0% in placebo), UTI 2.0% (vs 1.0% in placebo), pharyngitis 2.0% (vs 0 in placebo), and 
vulvovaginal mycotic infection 2.0% (vs 0 in placebo).  
The adverse events occurring with a frequency ≥2% for the 5 mg BID dapagliflozin/metformin IR 
FDC group and >1.5 times the incidence in the placebo were upper respiratory tract infection 
(2.0% vs 1.0% in placebo), vulvovaginal candidiasis (3.0% vs 0 in placebo), UTI (2.0% vs 1.0% 
in placebo), pharyngitis (2.0% vs 0 in placebo) and vulvovaginal mycotic infection (2.0% vs 0 in 
placebo). 
The most common AEs reported in dapagliflozin-treated subjects in the studies included in the 
Phase 3 safety program were generally consistent with the most common AEs reported for the 
pooled safety datasets in the initial dapagliflozin MAA.  
Adverse drug reactions previously identified for dapagliflozin and likely related to expected 
pharmacodynamic effects of dapagliflozin such as glucosuria or other urine composition 
alterations and genitourinary symptoms were reported at generally similar rates in subjects 
receiving dapagliflozin BID and those receiving dapagliflozin QD or placebo. Thus, vulvovaginitis, 
balanitis, and related genital infections were reported in 0%, 5%, 3% and 1% of subjects in the 
dapagliflozin 2.5 mg BID, 5 mg BID, 10 mg QD and placebo groups, respectively; UTI was 
reported in 2%, 4%, 2% and 1% of subjects, respectively; thirst was reported in 0%, 0%, 1% 
and 0% of subjects, respectively; hyperhidrosis was reported in 1%, 1%, 1% and 0% of 
subjects, respectively; dysuria was reported in 0%, 1%, 1% and 2% of subjects, respectively; 
and polyuria/pollakiuria was reported in 1%, 0%, 0% and 1% of subjects, respectively. The

following adverse drug reactions were not reported in study D1691C00003: vulvovaginal pruritis, 
volume depletion, nocturia, haematocrit increased, blood creatinine increased, and blood urea 
increased. 
In study D1691C00003, dapagliflozin co-administered with metformin did not increase the 
frequency of gastrointestinal AEs commonly observed with metformin use (abdominal pain, 
nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea. Gastrointestinal AEs occurred at similar frequency in the 
dapagliflozin groups and in the placebo group (abdominal pain 0% to 1.0% and 0%, 
respectively; nausea 0% to 1.0% and 1.0%, respectively; vomiting 0% and 1.0%, respectively; 
diarrhoea 0% to 4.0% and 3.0%, respectively. During the 16-week treatment period, the 
proportion of subjects with at least one AE was slightly higher in the dapagliflozin 2.5 mg BID 
and 10 mg QD groups (40.0% and 46.5%, respectively) compared with the dapagliflozin 5 mg 
BID and placebo groups (33.0% and 36.6%, respectively). Hypoglycaemic events were rare, 
reported by 3 subjects (0.8%) across all treatment groups (1 subject in the dapagliflozin 2.5 mg 
BID group [1%] and 2 subjects in the dapagliflozin 10 mg QD group [2%]). No major episode of 
hypoglycaemia was reported and no subject discontinued study treatment due to a 
hypoglycaemic event. In the long term extensions (LT) of the Phase 3 studies of dapagliflozin 
administered QD as add-on to metformin in combination with sitagliptin (D1690C00010)a higher 
incidence of adverse events was observed and hypoglycaemic events was higher in the 
dapagliflozin group (5.3%) than in the placebo group (2.6%)  
The proportion of subjects experiencing at least one AE increased with increasing duration of 
study treatment, with a low proportion of around 40% of the subjects in all treatment groups in 
D1691C00003 (16 weeks duration); 56% to 58% in D1690C00012 (50 weeks); and around 80% 
across all treatment groups in MB102014 (102 weeks). 
Overall, no new safety signals were observed in the more recently reported Phase III studies of 
dapagliflozin administered BID as add-on to metformin alone (D1691C00003) or administered 
QD as add-on to metformin in combination with a DPP-4 inhibitor (D1690C00010). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
A total of 47 deaths have occurred (dapagliflozin integrated safety database, includes data from 
19 Phase 2b/3 studies in the dapagliflozin clinical development program; data cut-off date 15 
July 2011). Deaths were balanced across the placebo population (0.6%); the population 
receiving dapagliflozin and metformin (0.4%); and the population receiving dapagliflozin without 
metformin (0.6%). Twenty-three deaths were due to cardiac/vascular disorders, and 4 deaths 
were due to neoplasms. No deaths were reported in study D1691C00003. One death was 
reported in study D1690C00010. No events with outcome of death were considered related to 
study treatment.  
Serious adverse events 
In the initial dapagliflozin MAA, for the placebo-controlled pool (ST period), the most commonly 
reported SAEs across all dapagliflozin treatment groups (n = 3291) were pneumonia (0.3%), 
angina pectoris (0.2%), acute myocardial infarction (0.1%), cholelithiasis 0.1%), pulmonary

tuberculosis (0.1%), rotator cuff syndrome (0.1%), coronary artery disease (0.1%) and 
cerebrovascular accident (0.1%). 
D1691C00003 (add-on to metformin, dapagliflozin BID and QD) 
The following SAEs were reported. 
Table 19.  D1691C00003: All serious adverse events, by System Organ Class and 
Preferred Term (16-week double-blind treatment period, safety analysis set) 
D1690C00004 (add-on to metformin, direct comparison to SU): During the 104-week ST + LT1 
period, the proportion of subjects with an SAE was higher in the glipizide group (15.2%) than in 
the dapagliflozin group (12.6%). SAEs of myocardial infarction, diverticulitis, hypoglycaemia and 
anaemia were each reported in three subjects in the glipizide group and SAEs of prostate cancer 
were reported in three subjects in the dapagliflozin group. All other SAEs were reported by ≤ 2 
subjects in either treatment group. 
Malignant or unspecified tumours (ST+LT1) in study D1690C00004 are shown in the table below.

Table 20.  D1690C00004: Serious adverse events, by System Organ Class and Preferred 
Term (104-week ST + LT1 period, safety analysis set)  
No new cases of breast and bladder cancer were observed in the six Phase III studies included in 
this analysis of the 15 July 2011 integrated safety database, and one new post-study event of 
prostate cancer was reported in the comparator treatment group of study D1690C00004. 
The overall SAE profile observed in the six Phase III studies seems to be consistent with that 
previously reported for pooled datasets in the initial dapagliflozin MAA. 
Laboratory findings 
Increases in Serum Creatinine and Decreases in Creatinine Clearance and eGFR 
• 
In the short term D1691C00003 (add-on to metformin, dapagliflozin BID and QD, 16 w 
data):  
Mean serum creatinine concentration: subjects in the dapagliflozin groups showed a slight 
increase at Week 1 followed by a gradual decrease to baseline values at Week 16 (reversed at 
follow up). Subjects in the placebo group showed no clinically relevant changes. 
Mean calculated creatinine clearance: subjects in the dapagliflozin groups showed a decrease 
from baseline to Week 1 that remained almost stable until Week 16 (partially reversed at follow 
up). Subjects in the placebo group showed no clinically relevant changes. 
Mean eGFR: subjects in the dapagliflozin groups showed a slight decrease from baseline to Week 
8. The decrease remained stable until Week 16 in the dapagliflozin 2.5 and 5 mg BID groups, 
while subjects in the dapagliflozin 10 mg QD group showed a slight recovery at Weeks 12 and 
16. Subjects in the placebo group showed no clinically relevant changes.

• 
In the long term MB102014 (add-on to metformin, dapagliflozin QD, 102w data): 
Mean serum creatinine concentration and mean calculated creatinine clearance showed no 
clinically relevant changes from baseline were seen for any treatment group. 
Mean eGFR: increases from baseline in eGFR were consistently observed in all treatment groups 
beginning at Week 24. At Week 102, the mean increases were larger in the dapagliflozin 5 mg 
and 10 mg groups than in the placebo and dapagliflozin 2.5 mg group. 
• 
In the long term D1690C00006 (add-on to insulin, 104w data): 
Mean serum creatinine concentration and mean calculated creatinine clearance showed no 
clinically relevant changes from baseline were seen for any treatment group. 
Mean eGFR: subjects in the dapagliflozin groups showed a slight decrease from baseline to Week 
48 followed by a gradual increase to baseline level in the dapagliflozin 5/10 mg group but not in 
the other dapagliflozin groups. At follow-up, most of the changes observed at Week 104 in the 
dapagliflozin 2.5 and 10 mg groups were reversible in the safety analysis set as well as in all 
subjects completing the study. 
Serum electrolytes 
No clinically relevant changes or trends from baseline in serum electrolytes were observed in the 
treatment groups. 
Vital signs 
Consistent with the initial dapagliflozin MAA, slight mean reductions in systolic blood pressure 
(SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were observed during ST and LT treatment periods in 
dapagliflozin-treated subjects in the Phase 3 studies. 
In the add-on to sitagliptin study (D1690C00010) the dapagliflozin treatment group, placebo-
corrected mean reduction in SBP in subjects with baseline seated SBP ≥ 130 mmHg was -0.86 
mmHg at Week 8 (ST). Seated SBP was evaluated regarding change from baseline to week 24 
(LOCF). Analyses including and excluding data after rescue showed a mean decrease of -1.8 and 
-2.1 mmHg in seated SBP respectively, in the dapagliflozin group and no meaningful mean 
change in seated SBP in the placebo group (p<0.05 including data after rescue, p>0.05 
excluding data after rescue for the difference between groups). Proportions of subjects with 
orthostatic hypotension (fall in SBP of > 20 mmHg or DBP of > 10 mmHg [supine to standing]) 
during the ST + LT treatment periods were consistent across all treatment groups, including 
placebo. 
Safety in special populations 
All recommendations and contraindications outlined in this section are based on the proposed 
wording of the SmPC for the dapagliflozin/metformin IR FDC, which reflects the current 
understanding of the safety profile of dapagliflozin when used in combination with metformin.

Elderly 
There is only limited data for patients ≥75 year (n=67 in the ST placebo-controlled pool in the 
initial MAA for Forxiga) and the safety of this group has not been evaluated separately. Due to 
the limited therapeutic experience with dapagliflozin in patients ≥75 year, initiation of 
dapagliflozin/metformin IR FDC therapy is not recommended.  
Monitoring of renal function is necessary to prevent metformin associated lactic acidosis, 
particularly in the elderly (≥65 years). In subjects ≥65 years of age, a higher proportion of 
subjects treated with dapagliflozin had adverse reactions related to volume depletion.  
Gender 
All of the Phase III safety and tolerability data were generated in relatively balanced proportions 
of male and female patients with T2DM. 
In the Phase III programme events suggestive of genital infection and events suggestive of UTI 
were reported for a greater proportion of females than males in all treatment groups. 
Renal impairment and lactic acidosis 
Metformin is excreted by the kidney and moderate to severe renal insufficiency increases the risk 
of lactic acidosis. Therefore, the dapagliflozin/metformin IR FDC should not be used in patients 
with moderate to severe renal impairment (patients with CrCl < 60 mL/min or eGFR < 60 
mL/min/1.73 m2). This recommendation is consistent with the contraindications for metformin 
monotherapy (Glucophage SmPC). No dose adjustment will be recommended for patients with 
mild renal impairment receiving the dapagliflozin/metformin IR FDC 
Hepatic impairment and lactic acidosis 
Because of the risk of lactic acidosis associated with metformin in patients with impaired hepatic 
function described in the Glucophage SmPC, the dapagliflozin/metformin IR FDC will be 
contraindicated in patients with hepatic impairment.  
Tissue hypoxia 
Because of metformin, Xigduo is contraindicated in patients with acute or chronic disease which 
may cause tissue hypoxia such as: cardiac or respiratory failure, recent myocardial infarction and 
shock.  
Heart failure 
Experience in NYHA class I-II is limited, and there is no experience in clinical studies with 
dapagliflozin in NYHA class III-IV. 
Safety based on pioglitazone use 
Available epidemiological data for pioglitazone suggest a small increased risk of bladder cancer in 
diabetic patients treated with pioglitazone. While a causal relationship between dapagliflozin and 
bladder cancer is unlikely, as a precautionary measure, the dapagliflozin/metformin IR FDC will 
not be recommended for use in patients concomitantly treated with pioglitazone. This 
recommendation is consistent with the recommendations for the use of dapagliflozin 
monotherapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/620505/2013

Pregnancy and lactation 
The dapagliflozin/metformin IR FDC will not be recommended during the second and third 
trimesters of pregnancy. Treatment with the dapagliflozin/metformin IR FDC should be 
discontinued when pregnancy is detected. The dapagliflozin/metformin IR FDC must not be used 
while breast feeding. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No dedicated interaction studies have been performed for the dapagliflozin/metformin IR FDC. 
The following statements reflect the current knowledge on the individual active substances. 
Dapagliflozin has a low potential for drug-drug interactions and no clinically relevant interactions 
have been shown for the most commonly used concomitant medications in adult T2DM patients.  
The SmPC includes the wording of the European Core Safety Profile for metformin with regards 
to interaction with diuretics. 
Metformin is excreted by the kidney and moderate to severe renal insufficiency increases the risk 
of lactic acidosis (Glucophage SmPC). The dapagliflozin/metformin IR FDC will not be 
recommended for use in patients receiving loop diuretics or who are volume depleted, e.g. due to 
acute illness (such as gastrointestinal illness). Caution should be exercised in patients for whom 
a dapagliflozin induced drop in blood pressure could pose a risk, such as patients with known 
cardiovascular disease, patients on anti-hypertensive therapy with a history of hypotension, or 
elderly patients. Careful monitoring of volume status (physical examination, blood pressure 
measurements, and laboratory tests including haematocrit) and electrolytes will be 
recommended for patients receiving the dapagliflozin/metformin IR FDC, especially during 
intercurrent conditions that may lead to volume depletion. Temporary interruption of treatment 
with the dapagliflozin/metformin IR FDC will be recommended for patients who develop volume 
depletion until the depletion is corrected. These recommendations are consistent with the 
recommendations for the use of dapagliflozin monotherapy (Forxiga SmPC). 
There is increased risk of lactic acidosis in acute alcohol intoxication (particularly in the case of 
fasting, malnutrition or hepatic impairment) due to the metformin active substance of the 
dapagliflozin/metformin IR FDC. Consumption of alcohol and medicinal products containing 
alcohol should be avoided. 
The intravascular administration of iodinated contrast agents in radiological studies may lead to 
renal failure, resulting in metformin accumulation and a risk of lactic acidosis. Therefore, the 
dapagliflozin/metformin IR FDC must be discontinued prior to, or at the time of the test and not 
reinstituted until 48 hours afterwards, and only after renal function has been re-evaluated and 
found to be normal. 
Lactic acidosis is identified as important identified risk in the dapagliflozin/metformin IR FDC 
RMP. No events of lactic acidosis were observed in the dapagliflozin development program.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Overall, in the Phase III program, no consistent pattern in DAEs was observed that would 
suggest new safety concerns for dapagliflozin/metformin IR FDC. The PTs leading to the 
discontinuation of more than 1 dapagliflozin treated (dapagliflozin + met) subject reported 
consistently across most of the individual studies were creatinine renal clearance decreased 
(0.4% to 4.0% of total subjects) and blood creatinine increased (0.2% to 1.5% of total 
subjects). In metformin + placebo treated subjects creatinine renal clearance decreased in 0.4% 
to 3.0% of total subjects and blood creatinine increased in 0 to 0.7% of total subjects. During 
the 102-week ST + LT period, AEs leading to discontinuation of study therapy were reported by 
similar proportions of subjects across treatment groups (3.7% to 5.1% in the dapagliflozin 
groups and 6.6% in the placebo group. 
Post marketing experience 
At the time of the submission dapagliflozin was not marketed anywhere in the world. There is 
extensive clinical experience with metformin as a widely available and well-established treatment 
for T2DM. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The database for studying the safety of the dapagliflozin/metformin immediate release (IR) fixed 
dose combination (FDC) in subjects with T2DM is considered sufficient. Data on subjects ≥  65 
years is limited. There was some variation across the studies in exclusion criteria for renal 
impairment. In most of the studies, eligibility was based on CrCl > 60 mL/min. Patients with 
severe renal impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/ 1.73 m2) and cardiac failure, NYHA class III and 
IV, have been excluded from studies. The extent of exposure to open-label metformin was 
generally similar to the extent of exposure to double-blind study medication. The daily mean 
dose of open-label metformin ranged from 1800 to 2000 mg daily across all treatment groups, 
which conforms closely to the daily metformin doses of the different formulations of the FDC 
product; metformin 1700 mg (850 mg BID) and 2000 mg (1000 mg BID). The safety profile of 
metformin is well-known. The safety profile of the dapagliflozin/metformin IR FDC is expected to 
be similar to the safety profile of dapagliflozin and metformin as individual components taken as 
combination therapy. 
The deaths observed in the completed studies (as of 15 July 2011) were unrelated to 
dapagliflozin treatment. No deaths were reported in the short term key study BID 5 mg 
dapagliflozin/metformin IR FDC study D1691C00003 (as of 18 Nov 2011). No new cases of 
breast and bladder cancer were observed in the six Phase III studies included in this analysis of 
the 15 July 2011 integrated safety database, and one new post-study event of prostate cancer 
was reported in the comparator treatment group of study D1690C00004. The overall SAE profile 
observed in the six Phase III studies seemed consistent with that previously reported for pooled 
datasets in the initial dapagliflozin MAA.  
In the six Phase III studies proportions of subjects with AEs of cardiac disorders were 2 to 13.4% 
in the dapagliflozin and 2 to 13.2% in the placebo group in the LT extensions of add-on

metformin. SAEs were balanced between groups. Even though these six Phase III studies (add-
on Metformin) were not designed to evaluate CV safety on an individual study basis, no new 
safety signal regarding CV-related AEs was observed either with BID dosing of dapagliflozin add-
on to metformin, or in the LT extensions of the Phase III studies. It cannot be excluded that high 
CV risk patients concomitantly taking loop diuretics and/or antihypertensive drugs may be at 
increased risk for a CV events when starting dapagliflozin, possibly due to diuresis-induced 
decrease in blood pressure. However, the absolute number of CV events in these ongoing studies 
is still limited and the imbalance small and uncertain. According to the well-known safety profile 
of metformin the dapagliflozin/metformin IR FDC is contraindicated in acute or chronic disease 
which may cause tissue hypoxia and information is included in the SmPC. At the CHMP request, 
the applicant has submitted a summary of mean percent change from baseline for dapagliflozin 
and metformin groups versus placebo, respectively, of: total cholesterol (TC), high-density 
lipoprotein cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. When looking at the 
individual studies, the data is not consistent across the studies and there is variability over time. 
This may in part be explained by the limited data set. However, the pooled data show that TC 
continues to increase over time. The increase in HDL over time appears greater than the increase 
in LDL, whereas TG tend to decrease over time. The clinical relevance of the observed changes 
will have to be further investigated in the planned CV outcomes study. Adequate information is 
included in the SmPC. 
Incidence of hypoglycaemic events is relatively low and similar (3.6-5.2%) across treatment 
groups when used as add-on to metformin, or as add-on to sitagliptin with no major episode of 
hypoglycaemia reported, and no subject discontinued study treatment due to a hypoglycaemic 
event. As expected, the incidence is high (42.6-69.3%) in both the dapagliflozin + metformin 
and placebo groups with add-on insulin therapy. The majority of hypoglycaemic events were 
classified as minor. Data from the Phase III studies indicate that BID dosing of dapagliflozin add-
on to metformin, as well as LT treatment with dapagliflozin were generally consistent with those 
reported in the initial dapagliflozin MAA.  
Proportions of subjects with AEs of genital infections were larger in the dapagliflozin (3 to 14.6%) 
than in the placebo group (1.0 to 5.1%) in the LT extensions of add-on metformin. This confirms 
the importance the information included in the SmPC. Most infections were mild to moderate, 
and subjects responded to an initial course of standard treatment, and infections rarely resulted 
in discontinuation of treatment. These infections were more frequent in females. No new safety 
signal regarding genital infections was observed in the LT extensions of the Phase III studies. 
Proportions of subjects with AEs of UTI were larger in the dapagliflozin (2 to 11.8%) than in the 
placebo group (1.0 to 5.1%) in the LT extensions of add-on metformin. This confirms the 
importance the warnings included in the SmPC. Most infections were mild to moderate, and 
subjects responded to an initial course of standard treatment, and infections rarely resulted in 
discontinuation of treatment. Pyelonephritis was uncommon and occurred at a similar frequency 
to control. 
Proportions of subjects with AEs of renal impairment or failure were larger in the dapagliflozin 
(1.5 to 4.4%) than in the placebo group (1.5 to 2.0%) in the LT extensions of add-on metformin. 
Metformin is excreted by the kidney and moderate to severe renal insufficiency increases the risk 
of lactic acidosis (Glucophage SmPC). Therefore, the dapagliflozin/metformin IR FDC should not

be used in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (patients with CrCl < 60 mL/min 
or eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2). 
Proportions of subjects with AEs of volume depletion were slightly higher in the dapagliflozin (0 
to 2.5%) than in the placebo group (0 to 1.5%) in the LT extensions of add-on metformin. Few 
events of syncope (3) and the events were balanced between groups. Small but consistent 
increases in haematocrit were observed among dapagliflozin-treated subjects across the entire 
Phase III dapagliflozin clinical programme, which are likely related to mild plasma volume 
depletion associated with the diuretic effect of dapagliflozin. Proportions of subjects with AEs of 
haematocrit values >55% were larger (0.5 to 2.3%) in the dapagliflozin than in the placebo 
group (0 to 0.7%) in the LT extensions of add-on metformin and in the dapagliflozin group 
(1.3%) vs comparator (SU) (0) and in 4.5% of subjects in the dapagliflozin group vs 0.4% of 
subjects in the placebo group in add-on combination therapy with sitagliptin. This confirms the 
importance the warnings in the SmPC.No subjects reported associated thromboembolic AEs, 
except for one subject in the dapagliflozin 5/10 mg group.  
Liver injury is included as a potential risk in the RMP due to one subject in study D1690C00004 
diagnosed with drug-induced hepatitis and/or autoimmune hepatitis. The event is described in 
the current SmPC. A detailed post marketing plan for liver safety monitoring has been proposed, 
including a pharmacoepidemiology programme and follow-up in the planned CV outcomes study. 
An analysis based on the 15 July 2011 integrated safety database to investigate the risk of liver 
toxicity found that there was no clear association between dapagliflozin treatment and liver 
toxicity, and no evidence of severe drug-induced liver injury. No new hepatic safety signals were 
observed either with BID dosing of dapagliflozin add-on to metformin or in the LT extensions of 
the Phase III studies. Proportions of subjects with AEs of hepatic disorders were slightly higher 
(0 to 3.3%) in the dapagliflozin than in the placebo group (1 to 2.2%) in the LT extensions of 
add-on metformin and modestly higher in the dapagliflozin group (2.7%) vs comparator (SU) 
(1.7%) and lower in 1.3% of subjects in the dapagliflozin group vs 3.5% of subjects in the 
placebo group in add-on combination therapy with sitagliptin. Xigduo will be contraindicated for 
use in patients with hepatic impairment, in line with metformin SmPC, because of the risk of 
lactic acidosis associated with metformin in patients with impaired hepatic function. 
Bone fracture is identified as a potential risk in the RMP based on mean increases in markers of 
bone resorption in dapagliflozin-treated subjects compared with placebo-treated subjects 
observed in the early dapagliflozin clinical programme. In the Phase III studies proportions of 
subjects with AEs of bone fracture were 0 to 3.6% in the dapagliflozin and 0 to 3.0% in the 
placebo group in the placebo group in the LT extensions of add-on metformin. Bone fractures 
were balanced between groups. At the CHMP request, the applicant has submitted a summary of 
mean percent change from baseline for dapagliflozin and metformin groups versus placebo for 
the Phase 3 studies of: 25(OH)D, PTH and calcium and phosphorus. A summary of results of 
bone mineral density measurements (dapagliflozin+ metformin compared to placebo from 
baseline to 102 weeks) in study D1690C00012, was also submitted. In most of the studies, an 
increase in PTH was observed ranging from 2 % to 25 % vs placebo. The clinical relevance of this 
observation remains unclear. The data provided does not indicate an adverse effect of 
dapagliflozin either on calcium, phosphorus, 25(OH)D or BMD. Bone fractures are included as an 
important potential risk in the RMP and adequate information on PTH changes is included in the 
SmPC which is considered sufficient.

Page 93/105 
 
  
  
Across the dapagliflozin Phase III clinical programme, the overall proportion of subjects with 
malignant or unspecified tumours was balanced between dapagliflozin and placebo/comparator 
treatment groups. However, a numerical imbalance between dapagliflozin and comparator is still 
evident for bladder, breast, and prostate cancer. No new cases of breast and bladder cancer 
were observed in the six Phase III studies included in this submission since the analysis of the 15 
July 2011 integrated safety database, and one new post-study event of prostate cancer was 
reported in the comparator treatment group of study D1690C00004. The reported events 
occurred across the clinical programme and in different treatment combinations, indicating no 
increased risk when dapagliflozin is combined with metformin specifically. The overall reported 
neoplasms indicate no change or increased risk associated with dapagliflozin long term therapy 
(up to 2 years). Dapagliflozin will not be recommended for patients who use pioglitazone because 
of a small increase in the risk of bladder cancer ascribed to pioglitazone in recent independent 
pharmacoepidemiology studies. 
At the CHMP request the applicant submitted pooled safety data from five of the six Phase III 
studies. The data from the active comparator study was not included due to differences in study 
design which is acceptable. The pooled data for the short-term parts of the studies (presented by 
number of patients to be consistent with the presentation of safety data for dapagliflozin) showed 
that the safety profile for the FDC is comparable to that of dapagliflozin. Thus the data support 
the inclusion of Genital Infection, Urinary tract infection and Hypoglycaemia in the adverse 
reaction table in section 4.8 of the SmPC with the same frequencies as for dapagliflozin. No 
additional adverse reactions were deemed to be included. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The findings resulting from the submitted data reflecting treatment with dapagliflozin/metformin 
IR for up to 104 weeks show that the safety profile of the FDC is comparable to that observed for 
dapagliflozin. There were tendencies to higher incidences of AEs of elevated haematocrit and 
renal impairment, which emphasizes the importance of the warnings and precautions to be 
included in the SmPC, especially in the elderly population. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The applicant has submitted a signed summary of pharmacovigilance system. The CHMP 
considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the legislative 
requirements.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The main goal in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus is to achieve adequate glycaemic 
control in order to reduce long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications caused by 
chronic hyperglycaemia. In practice, most patients will eventually require multiple medications 
during the course of their disease to maintain glycaemic control. The need for multiple 
antidiabetic medications, however, often leads to poor adherence to therapy. Thus, the 
combination of dapagliflozin and metformin available as one tablet could provide an additional 
treatment option for patients with T2DM, and may improve patient compliance. 
The clinical data provided with this application show that the addition of dapagliflozin in patients 
with inadequate control on metformin alone or metformin in combination with other OADs such 
as sulphonylureas, DPP4-inhibitors or insulin results in clinically relevant and statistically 
significant reductions in HbA1c. The combination of dapagliflozin and metformin has already been 
approved for dapagliflozin, based in most parts on the same data as presented in the current 
application. 
Dapagliflozin when used as single component is dosed once daily. Therefore pharmacokinetic, 
pharmacodynamic and clinical data has been provided to support the 5mg BID dosing needed 
when dapagliflozin is combined with metformin. The proposed metformin dose is well established 
and is covered by the range of doses used in the clinical programme. 
Pharmacokinetic data showing similar exposure after administration of dapagliflozin 5 mg BID 
and 10 mg OD supports the proposed twice daily administration of Xigduo. This is further 
supported by a similar pharmacodynamic response in terms of inhibition of renal glucose re-
absorption for the 5 mg BID and 10 mg OD. 
Bioequivalence between Xigduo FDC and dapagliflozin and metformin administered has mono-
components has been demonstrated which is crucial in order to support the substitution 
indication and also to bridge from the monotherapy tablets used in the clinical studies. 
In the clinical study DC1691C00003, comparable placebo-corrected reductions in HbA1c were 
observed for the dapagliflozin 5 mg BID (-0.35 %) and 10 mg OD (-0.29 %) dosing. The 
outcome was somewhat less than observed for the dapagliflozin 10 mg OD group in study 
MB102014 where a placebo-corrected HbA1c reduction of -0.54 % was observed, but in line with 
the outcome in study D1690C00012 (-0.28 %). The outcome of the primary endpoint was 
supported by the outcome of the secondary variables. A clinically relevant weight reduction 
ranging between 1.5 and 2.0 kg was observed across studies.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The efficacy of the combination has been adequately shown and no uncertainties remain. Long-
term data up to 104 weeks has been provided showing a maintained effect on glycaemic control 
and maintained weight reduction. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
As for dapagliflozin, the most common adverse events in the Phase 3 studies were genital (6.6 % 
vs 1.1 %) and urinary tract infections (4.8 % vs 3.2 %), which are related to the mechanism of 
action for dapagliflozin. Hypoglycemia was also commonly reported (7.9 % vs 6.7 %), although 
the difference between treatment groups were less prominent. There were tendencies to higher 
but reversible incidences of AEs of elevated haematocrit and renal impairment, which emphasizes 
the importance of the warnings and precautions included in the SmPC, especially in the elderly 
population with increased risk for volume depletion. Data is limited in the elderly population.  
The FDC with metformin could increase the risk of lactic acidosis in type 2 diabetes patients with 
significant renal impairment and therefore precaution is needed in this subpopulation. Lactic 
acidosis is a very rare but serious (more than 50% mortality in the absence of prompt 
treatment), metabolic complication that can occur due to accumulation of metformin, a 
component of Xigduo. It is of importance to monitor the renal function before start and during 
treatment with dapagliflozin and inform patients of a healthy intake of water and nutrition to 
balance volume depletion and metabolic changes that could interact with lipid metabolism. The 
incidence of lactic acidosis can and should be reduced by also assessing other associated risk 
factors such as poorly controlled diabetes, ketosis, prolonged fasting, excessive alcohol intake, 
hepatic insufficiency and any conditions associated with hypoxia. 
The pooled long-term safety data from five of the six Phase 3 studies does not indicate any 
change in the safety profile of Xigduo over time. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Lipid changes with increased in total cholesterol, HDL and LDL have been observed with both 
dapagliflozin and dapagliflozin/metformin treatment. The clinical relevance of these changes 
remains unclear and will be further investigated in the planned CV outcomes study which is 
deemed sufficient. 
In most of the studies, an increase in PTH was observed ranging from 2 % to 25 % vs placebo. 
The clinical relevance of this observation remains unclear. The data provided does not indicate an 
adverse effect of dapagliflozin either on calcium, phosphorus, 25(OH)D or BMD. Bone fractures 
are included as an important potential risk in the RMP and adequate information on PTH changes 
is included in the SmPC which is considered sufficient. Bone fractures will also be monitored in 
the planned CV outcomes study.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
When dapagliflozin is added to metformin in patients with inadequate metabolic control, a 
clinically relevant reduction of HbA1c is observed. The improved metabolic control is achieved 
with a concomitant decrease in body weight, which is considered a benefit in type 2 diabetes 
mellitus patients with overweight often being a problem. Providing the treatment in a fixed dose 
combination has the potential of improving compliance. 
The safety profile for dapagliflozin/metformin IR FDC has been adequately described and 
identified safety issues are taken care of within the SmPC and the risk management plan. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The benefit-risk balance for concomitant treatment with dapagliflozin and metformin has already 
been accepted as positive for the free combination. 
The CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of dapagliflozin/metformin fixed dose 
combination is positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Xigduo in treatment of  
“adults aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise 
to improve glycaemic control  
• in patients inadequately controlled on their maximally tolerated dose of metformin alone  
• in combination with other glucose lowering medicinal products, including insulin, in patients 
inadequately controlled with metformin and these medicinal products (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 
5.1 for available data on different combinations)  
• in patients already being treated with the combination of dapagliflozin and metformin as 
separate tablets” 
is favourable and therefore recommends  the granting of the  marketing authorisation subject to 
the following conditions:

•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in 
the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed 
subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
• 
At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk 
profile or as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) 
milestone being reached.  
If the dates for submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they can be submitted 
at the same time.

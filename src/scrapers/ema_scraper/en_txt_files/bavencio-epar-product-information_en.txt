Treatment modifications when Bavencio is used in combination with axitinib 
If ALT or AST ≥ 3 times ULN but < 5 times ULN or total bilirubin ≥ 1.5 times ULN but < 3 times 
ULN, both Bavencio and axitinib should be withheld until these adverse reactions recover to 
Grades 0-1. If persistent (greater than 5 days), corticosteroid therapy with prednisone or equivalent 
followed by a taper should be considered. Rechallenge with Bavencio or axitinib or sequential 
rechallenge with both Bavencio and axitinib after recovery should be considered. Dose reduction 
according to the axitinib product information should be considered if rechallenging with axitinib. 
If ALT or AST ≥ 5 times ULN or > 3 times ULN with concurrent total bilirubin ≥ 2 times ULN or 
total bilirubin ≥ 3 times ULN, both Bavencio and axitinib should be permanently discontinued and 
corticosteroid therapy should be considered. 
Dose modification advice for axitinib when used with Bavencio 
When Bavencio is administered in combination with axitinib, please refer to the axitinib product 
information for recommended dose modifications for axitinib. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is needed for elderly patients (≥ 65 years) (see sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Bavencio in children and adolescents below 18 years of age have not been 
established. Currently available data of Bavencio are described in section 5.1 but no recommendation 
on a posology can be made. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
There are insufficient data in patients with severe renal impairment for dosing recommendations. 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is needed for patients with mild hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). There are 
insufficient data in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment for dosing recommendations. 
Method of administration 
Bavencio is for intravenous infusion only. It must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus 
injection. 
Bavencio has to be diluted with either sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or with 
sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution for injection. It is administered over 60 minutes as an 
intravenous infusion using a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low-protein binding 0.2 micrometre in-line or 
add-on filter. 
For instructions on the preparation and administration of the medicinal product, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Infusion-related reactions 
Infusion-related reactions, which might be severe, have been reported in patients receiving avelumab 
(see section 4.8). 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infusion-related reactions including pyrexia, 
chills, flushing, hypotension, dyspnoea, wheezing, back pain, abdominal pain, and urticaria. 
For Grade 3 or Grade 4 infusion-related reactions, the infusion should be stopped and avelumab 
should be permanently discontinued (see section 4.2). 
For Grade 1 infusion-related reactions, the infusion rate should be slowed by 50% for the current 
infusion. For patients with Grade 2 infusion-related reactions, the infusion should be temporary 
discontinued until Grade 1 or resolved, then the infusion will restart with a 50% slower infusion rate 
(see section 4.2). 
In case of recurrence of Grade 1 or Grade 2 infusion-related reaction, the patient may continue to 
receive avelumab under close monitoring, after appropriate infusion rate modification and 
premedication with paracetamol and antihistamine (see section 4.2). 
In clinical trials, 98.6% (433/439) of patients with infusion-related reactions had a first 
infusion-related reaction during the first 4 infusions of which 2.7% (12/439) were Grade ≥ 3. In the 
remaining 1.4% (6/439) of patients, infusion-related reactions occurred after the first 4 infusions and 
all were of Grade 1 or Grade 2.

Immune-related adverse reactions 
Most immune-related adverse reactions with avelumab were reversible and managed with temporary 
or permanent discontinuation of avelumab, administration of corticosteroids and/or supportive care. 
For suspected immune-related adverse reactions, adequate evaluation should be performed to confirm 
aetiology or exclude other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, avelumab should be 
withheld and corticosteroids administered. If corticosteroids are used to treat an adverse reaction, a 
taper of at least 1 month duration should be initiated upon improvement. 
In patients, whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled with corticosteroid use, 
administration of other systemic immunosuppressants may be considered. 
In patients with pre-existing autoimmune disease (AID), data from observational studies suggest that 
the risk of immune-related adverse reactions following immune-checkpoint inhibitor therapy may be 
increased as compared with the risk in patients without pre-existing AID. In addition, flares of the 
underlying AID were frequent, but the majority were mild and manageable. 
Immune-related pneumonitis 
Immune-related pneumonitis occurred in patients treated with avelumab. One fatal case has been 
reported in patients receiving avelumab (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of immune-related pneumonitis and causes other 
than immune-related pneumonitis should be ruled out. Suspected pneumonitis should be confirmed 
with radiographic imaging. 
Corticosteroids should be administered for Grade ≥ 2 events (initial dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day 
prednisone or equivalent, followed by a corticosteroid taper). 
Avelumab should be withheld for Grade 2 immune-related pneumonitis until resolution, and 
permanently discontinued for Grade 3, Grade 4 or recurrent Grade 2 immune-related pneumonitis (see 
section 4.2). 
Immune-related hepatitis 
Immune-related hepatitis occurred in patients treated with avelumab. Two fatal cases have been 
reported in patients receiving avelumab (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be monitored for changes in liver function and symptoms of immune-related hepatitis 
and causes other than immune-related hepatitis should be ruled out. 
Corticosteroids should be administered for Grade ≥ 2 events (initial dose 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone 
or equivalent, followed by a corticosteroid taper). 
Avelumab should be withheld for Grade 2 immune-related hepatitis until resolution and permanently 
discontinued for Grade 3 or Grade 4 immune-related hepatitis (see section 4.2). 
Immune-related colitis 
Immune-related colitis has been reported in patients receiving avelumab (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of immune-related colitis and causes other than 
immune-related colitis should be ruled out. Corticosteroids should be administered for Grade ≥ 2 
events (initial dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by a corticosteroid taper). 
Avelumab should be withheld for Grade 2 or Grade 3 immune-related colitis until resolution, and 
permanently discontinued for Grade 4 or recurrent Grade 3 immune-related colitis (see section 4.2).

Immune-related pancreatitis 
Immune-related pancreatitis has been reported in patients receiving avelumab. Two fatal cases have 
been reported in patients receiving avelumab in combination with axitinib (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of immune-related pancreatitis. In symptomatic 
patients, obtain gastroenterology consultation and laboratory investigations (including imaging) to 
ensure the initiation of appropriate measures at an early stage. Corticosteroids should be administered 
for immune-related pancreatitis (initial dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by 
a corticosteroid taper). 
Avelumab should be withheld in the event of suspected immune-related pancreatitis. Avelumab should 
be permanently discontinued if immune-related pancreatitis is confirmed (see section 4.2). 
Immune-related myocarditis 
Immune-related myocarditis has been reported in patients receiving avelumab. Two fatal cases have 
been reported in patients receiving avelumab in combination with axitinib (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of immune-related myocarditis. In symptomatic 
patients, obtain cardiologic consultation and laboratory investigations to ensure the initiation of 
appropriate measures at an early stage. Corticosteroids should be administered for immune-related 
myocarditis (initial dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by a corticosteroid 
taper). If no improvement within 24 hours on corticosteroids, additional immunosuppression (e.g., 
mycophenolate, infliximab, anti-thymocyte globulin) should be considered. 
Avelumab should be withheld in the event of suspected immune-related myocarditis. Avelumab 
should be permanently discontinued if immune-related myocarditis is confirmed (see section 4.2). 
Immune-related endocrinopathies 
Immune-related thyroid disorders, immune-related adrenal insufficiency, and Type 1 diabetes mellitus 
have been reported in patients receiving avelumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for 
clinical signs and symptoms of endocrinopathies. Avelumab should be withheld for Grade 3 or 
Grade 4 endocrinopathies until resolution (see section 4.2). 
Thyroid disorders (hypothyroidism/hyperthyroidism) 
Thyroid disorders can occur at any time during treatment (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be monitored for changes in thyroid function (at the start of treatment, periodically 
during treatment, and as indicated based on clinical evaluation) and for clinical signs and symptoms of 
thyroid disorders. Hypothyroidism should be managed with replacement therapy and hyperthyroidism 
with anti-thyroid medicinal product, as needed. 
Avelumab should be withheld for Grade 3 or Grade 4 thyroid disorders (see section 4.2). 
Adrenal insufficiency 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of adrenal insufficiency during and after 
treatment. Corticosteroids should be administered (1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone intravenously or oral 
equivalent) for Grade ≥ 3 adrenal insufficiency followed by a taper until a dose of less than or equal to 
10 mg/day has been reached. 
Avelumab should be withheld for Grade 3 or Grade 4 symptomatic adrenal insufficiency (see 
section 4.2). 
Type 1 diabetes mellitus 
Avelumab can cause Type 1 diabetes mellitus, including diabetic ketoacidosis (see section 4.8). 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients should be monitored for hyperglycaemia or other signs and symptoms of diabetes. Initiate 
treatment with insulin for Type 1 diabetes mellitus. Avelumab should be withheld and anti-
hyperglycaemics in patients with Grade ≥ 3 hyperglycaemia should be administered. Treatment with 
avelumab should be resumed when metabolic control is achieved on insulin replacement therapy. 
Immune-related nephritis and renal dysfunction 
Avelumab can cause immune-related nephritis (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be monitored for elevated serum creatinine prior to and periodically during treatment. 
Corticosteroids (initial dose of 1 to 2 mg/kg/day prednisone or equivalent followed by a corticosteroid 
taper) should be administered for Grade ≥ 2 nephritis. Avelumab should be withheld for Grade 2 or 
Grade 3 nephritis until resolution to ≤ Grade 1 and permanently discontinued for Grade 4 nephritis. 
Other immune-related adverse reactions 
Other clinically important immune-related adverse reactions were reported in less than 1% of patients: 
myositis, hypopituitarism, uveitis, myasthenia gravis, myasthenic syndrome, cystitis noninfective, 
sarcoidosis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome (see section 4.8). 
For suspected immune-related adverse reactions, ensure adequate evaluation to confirm aetiology or to 
rule out other causes. Based on the severity of the adverse reaction, avelumab should be withheld and 
corticosteroids to be administered. Avelumab should be resumed when the immune-related adverse 
reaction returns to Grade 1 or less following corticosteroid taper. Avelumab should be permanently 
discontinued for any Grade 3 immune-related adverse reaction that recurs and for Grade 4 
immune-related adverse reaction (see section 4.2). 
Hepatotoxicity (in combination with axitinib) 
Hepatotoxicity occurred in patients treated with avelumab in combination with axitinib with higher 
than expected frequencies of Grade 3 and Grade 4 ALT and AST elevation compared to avelumab 
alone (see section 4.8). 
Patients should be more frequently monitored for changes in liver function and symptoms as compared 
to when avelumab is used as monotherapy. 
Avelumab should be withheld for Grade 2 hepatotoxicity until resolution and permanently 
discontinued for Grade 3 or Grade 4 hepatotoxicity. Corticosteroids should be considered for 
Grade ≥ 2 events (see section 4.2). 
Patients excluded from clinical studies 
Patients with the following conditions were excluded from clinical trials: active central nervous system 
(CNS) metastasis; active or a history of autoimmune disease; a history of other malignancies within the 
last 5 years; organ transplant; conditions requiring therapeutic immune suppression or active infection 
with HIV, or hepatitis B or C. 
Avelumab should be used with caution in these populations after careful consideration of the potential 
benefit/risk on an individual basis. 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, i.e. essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been conducted with avelumab. 
Avelumab is primarily metabolised through catabolic pathways, therefore, it is not expected that 
avelumab will have pharmacokinetic drug-drug interactions with other medicinal products.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception 
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while receiving 
avelumab and should use effective contraception during treatment with avelumab and for at least 
1 month after the last dose of avelumab. 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited data from the use of avelumab in pregnant women. 
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with avelumab. However, in murine models of 
pregnancy, blockade of PD-L1 signalling has been shown to disrupt tolerance to the foetus and to 
result in an increased foetal loss (see section 5.3). These results indicate a potential risk, based on its 
mechanism of action, that administration of avelumab during pregnancy could cause foetal harm, 
including increased rates of abortion or stillbirth. 
Human IgG1 immunoglobulins are known to cross the placental barrier. Therefore, avelumab has the 
potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus. It is not recommended to use 
avelumab during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires treatment with 
avelumab. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether avelumab is excreted in human milk. Since it is known that antibodies can be 
secreted in human milk, a risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. 
Breast-feeding women should be advised not to breast-feed during treatment and for at least 1 month 
after the last dose due to the potential for serious adverse reactions in breast-fed infants. 
Fertility 
The effect of avelumab on male and female fertility is unknown. 
Although studies to evaluate the effect of avelumab on fertility have not been conducted, there were 
no notable effects in the female reproductive organs in monkeys based on 1-month and 3-month 
repeat-dose toxicity studies (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Avelumab has negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue has been reported 
following administration of avelumab (see section 4.8). Patients should be advised to use caution when 
driving or operating machinery until they are certain that avelumab does not adversely affect them. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Avelumab is associated with immune-related adverse reactions. Most of these, including severe 
reactions, resolved following initiation of appropriate medical therapy or withdrawal of avelumab (see 
“Description of selected adverse reactions” below). 
The most common adverse reactions with avelumab were fatigue (30.0%), nausea (23.6%), diarrhoea 
(18.5%), constipation (18.1%), decreased appetite (17.6%), infusion-related reactions (15.9%), 
vomiting (15.6%), and weight decreased (14.5%). 
The most common Grade ≥ 3 adverse reactions were anaemia (5.6%), hypertension (3.9%), 
hyponatraemia (3.6%), dyspnoea (3.5%), and abdominal pain (2.6%). Serious adverse reactions were 
immune-related adverse reactions and infusion-related reaction (see section 4.4).

tested positive. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For study B9991001 in the UC population, out of 344 patients with at least one valid ADA result at 
any time point treated with avelumab 10 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion every 2 weeks plus BSC, 
325 were evaluable for treatment-emergent ADA and 62 (19.1%) tested positive.

valid ADA result at any time point treated with avelumab 10 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion every 
2 weeks in combination with axitinib 5 mg twice daily, 453 were evaluable for treatment-emergent 
ADA and 66 (14.6%) tested positive. 
Overall, there was no evidence of altered pharmacokinetic profile, increased incidence of infusion 
reactions or effects on efficacy with anti-avelumab antibody development. The impact of neutralizing 
antibodies (nAb) is unknown. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Three patients were reported to be overdosed with 5% to 10% above the recommended dose of 
avelumab. The patients had no symptoms, did not require any treatment for the overdose, and 
continued on avelumab therapy. 
In case of overdose, patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions. 
The treatment is directed to the management of symptoms.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other antineoplastic agents, monoclonal antibodies, ATC code: L01FF04. 
Mechanism of action 
Avelumab is a human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody directed against programmed 
death ligand 1 (PD-L1). Avelumab binds PD-L1 and blocks the interaction between PD-L1 and the 
programmed death 1 (PD-1) and B7.1 receptors. This removes the suppressive effects of PD-L1 on 
cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells, resulting in the restoration of anti-tumour T-cell responses. Avelumab has also 
shown to induce natural killer (NK) cell-mediated direct tumour cell lysis via antibody-dependent 
cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Merkel cell carcinoma (study EMR100070-003) 
The efficacy and safety of avelumab was investigated in the single arm, multi-centre study 
EMR100070-003 with two parts. Part A was conducted in patients with histologically confirmed 
metastatic MCC, whose disease had progressed on or after chemotherapy administered for distant 
metastatic disease, with a life expectancy of more than 3 months. Part B included patients with 
histologically confirmed metastatic MCC who were treatment-naïve to systemic therapy in the 
metastatic setting. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with active or a history of central nervous system (CNS) metastasis; active or a history of 
autoimmune disease; a history of other malignancies within the last 5 years; organ transplant; 
conditions requiring therapeutic immune suppression or active infection with HIV, or hepatitis B or C 
were excluded. 
Patients received avelumab at a dose of 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. Patients with radiological disease progression not associated with significant 
clinical deterioration, defined as no new or worsening symptoms, no change in performance status for 
greater than two weeks, and no need for salvage therapy could continue treatment. 
Tumour response assessments were performed every 6 weeks, as assessed by an Independent Endpoint 
Review Committee (IERC) using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours (RECIST) v1.1. 
Study 003 Part A – previously-treated patients 
The major efficacy outcome measure was confirmed best overall response (BOR); secondary efficacy 
outcome measures included duration of response (DOR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall 
survival (OS). 
An efficacy analysis was conducted in all 88 patients after a minimum follow-up of 36 months. Patients 
received a median of 7 doses of avelumab (range: 1 dose to 95 doses), and the median duration of 
treatment was 17 weeks (range: 2 weeks to 208 weeks). 
Of the 88 patients, 65 (74%) were male, the median age was 73 years (range 33 years to 88 years), 
81 (92%) patients were Caucasian, and 49 (56%) patients and 39 (44%) patients with an Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 and 1, respectively. 
Overall, 52 (59%) patients were reported to have had 1 prior anti-cancer therapy for MCC, 26 (30%) 
with 2 prior therapies, and 10 (11%) with 3 or more prior therapies. Forty-seven (53%) of the patients 
had visceral metastases. 
Table 4 summarises efficacy endpoints in patients  receiving avelumab at the recommended dose for 
study EMR100070-003, Part A with a minimum follow-up of 36 months. Overall survival was 
evaluated in an analysis with a minimum follow-up of 44 months. The median OS was 12.6 months 
(95% CI 7.5, 17.1).

a minimum follow-up of 15 months at the time of the data cut-off (cut-off date 02 May 2019). 
Of the 116 patients, 81 (70%) were male, the median age was 74 years (range: 41 to 93 years), 75 
(65%) were white, and 72 (62%) and 44 (38%) had an ECOG performance status of 0 and 1 
respectively.

Locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (study B9991001) 
The efficacy and safety of avelumab was demonstrated in study B9991001, a randomised, multi-centre, 
open-label study conducted in 700 patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic urothelial 
carcinoma whose disease had not progressed with 4-6 cycles of first-line platinum-based induction 
chemotherapy. Patients with autoimmune disease or a medical condition that required 
immunosuppression were excluded. 
Randomization was stratified by best response to chemotherapy (CR/PR vs. stable disease [SD]) and 
site of metastasis (visceral vs. non-visceral) at the time of initiating first-line induction chemotherapy. 
Patients were randomised (1:1) to receive either avelumab 10 mg/kg intravenous infusion every 
2 weeks plus best supportive care (BSC) or BSC alone. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Administration of avelumab was permitted beyond Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours 
(RECIST) v1.1-defined progression of disease by Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) if the 
patient was clinically stable and considered to be deriving clinical benefit by the investigator. 
Assessment of tumour status was performed at baseline, 8 weeks after randomization, then every 
8 weeks up to 12 months after randomization, and every 12 weeks thereafter until documented 
confirmed disease progression based on BICR assessment per RECIST v1.1. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally well balanced between the avelumab plus 
BSC and the BSC alone arm. Baseline characteristics were a median age of 69 years (range: 32 to 90), 
66% of patients were 65 years or older, 77% were male, 67% were White, and the ECOG PS was 
0 (61%) or 1 (39%) for both arms. 
For first-line induction chemotherapy, 56% of patients received cisplatin plus gemcitabine, 38% of 
patients received carboplatin plus gemcitabine and 6% of patients received cisplatin plus gemcitabine 
and carboplatin plus gemcitabine (i.e. these patients received one or more cycles of each combination). 
Best response to first-line induction chemotherapy was CR or PR (72%) or SD (28%). Sites of 
metastasis prior to chemotherapy were visceral (55%) or non-visceral (45%). Fifty-one percent of 
patients had PD-L1-positive tumours. Six percent of patients in the avelumab plus BSC arm and 44% of 
patients in the BSC alone arm received another PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor after discontinuation 
of treatment. 
The primary efficacy outcome measure was overall survival (OS) in all randomized patients and in 
patients with PD-L1-positive tumours. Progression-free survival (PFS) based on BICR assessment per 
RECIST v1.1 was an additional efficacy outcome measure. Efficacy outcomes were measured from 
time of randomisation after 4 to 6 cycles of platinum-based induction chemotherapy. 
The PD-L1 status of the tumour was assessed using the Ventana PD-L1 (SP263) assay. 
PD-L1-positivity was defined as ≥ 25% of tumour cells stained for PD-L1; or ≥ 25% of immune cells 
stained for PD-L1 if > 1% of the tumour area contained immune cells; or 100% of immune cells 
stained for PD-L1 if = 1% of the tumour area contained immune cells. 
At the pre-specified interim analysis (cut-off date 21 October 2019), study B9991001 met its primary 
endpoint for OS in both coprimary populations: in all randomized patients with a median OS of 
21.4 months (95% CI: 18.9, 26.1; HR 0.69, 95% CI: 0.556, 0.863) in the avelumab plus BSC arm and 
with a median OS of 14.3 months (95% CI: 12.9, 17.8) in the BSC alone arm. For patients with 
PD-L1-positive tumours the median OS was not reached (95% CI: 20.3, not reached; HR 0.56, 95%, 
CI: 0.404, 0.787) in the avelumab plus BSC arm and the median OS in the BSC alone arm was 
17.1 months (95% CI: 13.5, 23.7). Updated OS results with a data cut-off date of 19 January 2020 and 
PFS data with a cut-off date of 21 October 2019 are presented in Table 8 and in Figure 3 and Figure 4 
below.

Renal cell carcinoma (study B9991003) 
The efficacy and safety of avelumab in combination with axitinib was demonstrated in study 
B9991003, a randomised, multi-centre, open-label study of avelumab in combination with axitinib in 
886 patients with untreated advanced or metastatic RCC with a clear-cell component. 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients were included irrespective of prognostic risk groups or tumour PD-L1 expression and had to 
have at least one measurable lesion as defined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours 
(RECIST) version 1.1 that was not been previously irradiated. Patients with prior systemic therapy 
directed at advanced or metastatic RCC; prior systemic immunotherapy treatment with IL-2, IFN-α, 
anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-CTLA-4 antibodies, or active brain metastasis; active autoimmune 
disease that might deteriorate when receiving an immunostimulatory agents; a history of other 
malignancies within the last 5 years; organ transplant were ineligible. 
Randomization was stratified according to Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) 
Performance Status (PS) (0 vs. 1) and region (United States vs. Canada/Western Europe vs. the rest of 
the world). Patients were randomised (1:1) to one of the following treatment arms: 
• 
Avelumab 10 mg/kg intravenous infusion every 2 weeks in combination with axitinib 5 mg 
twice daily orally (N=442). Patients who tolerated axitinib 5 mg twice daily without Grade 2 or 
greater axitinib-related adverse events for 2 consecutive weeks could increase to 7 mg and then 
subsequently to 10 mg twice daily. Axitinib could be interrupted or reduced to 3 mg twice daily 
and subsequently to 2 mg twice daily to manage toxicity. 
Sunitinib 50 mg once daily orally for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks off (N=444) until 
radiographic or clinical progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
• 
Treatment with avelumab and axitinib continued until RECIST v1.1-defined progression of disease by 
Blinded Independent Central Review (BICR) assessment or unacceptable toxicity. Administration of 
avelumab and axitinib was permitted beyond RECIST-defined disease progression based on 
investigator’s assessment of the patient’s benefit-risk and clinical condition, including performance 
status, clinical symptoms, adverse events and laboratory data. The majority (n=160, 71.4%) of the 
patients with progressive disease continued treatment with both medicinal products after progression. 
Assessment of tumour status was performed at baseline, after randomisation at 6 weeks, then every 
6 weeks thereafter up to 18 months after randomisation, and every 12 weeks thereafter until 
documented confirmed disease progression by BICR. 
The primary efficacy endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), as assessed by BICR using 
RECIST v1.1 and overall survival (OS) in the first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC who 
have PD-L1-positive tumours (PD-L1 expression level ≥ 1%). The key secondary endpoints were PFS 
based on BICR assessment per RECIST v1.1 and OS irrespective of PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 status 
was determined by immunohistochemistry. Additional secondary endpoints included objective 
response (OR), time to response (TTR) and duration of response (DOR). 
Study population characteristics: median age of 61 years (range: 27.0 to 88.0), 38% of patients were 
65 years or older, 75% were male, 75% were White, and the ECOG performance score was 0 (63%) or 
1 (37%). 
Patient distribution by International Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (IMDC) 
risk groups was 21% favourable, 62% intermediate, and 16% poor. Patient distribution by Memorial 
Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) risk groups was 22% favourable, 65% intermediate, and 
11% poor. 
Efficacy results are presented in Table 9 and Figure 5 based on a data cut-off date of 28 January 2019. 
With a median OS follow-up of 19 months, OS data were immature with 27% deaths. The observed 
hazard ratio (HR) for OS was 0.80 (95% CI: 0.616, 1.027) for avelumab in combination with axitinib 
compared to sunitinib.

Paediatric population 
Study MS100070-0306 was a multi-centre, open-label, Phase I/II study to evaluate the dose, safety 
and tolerability, antitumour activity, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamics of avelumab in 
paediatric patients from birth to less than 18 years of age with refractory or relapsed solid tumours 
including central nervous system (CNS) tumours and lymphoma for which no standard therapy is 
available or for which the patient was not eligible for the existing therapy. 
The study enrolled 21 paediatric patients with an age ranged from 3 to 17 years (11 patients ≤ 12 years 
and 10 patients > 12 years) receiving either 10 mg/kg (N=6) or 20 mg/kg (N=15) avelumab 
intravenously every 2 weeks until confirmed progression, death, or unacceptable toxicity. 
The primary tumour categories were soft tissue/bone sarcoma (N=12), CNS malignancies (N=8), and 
gastro-intestinal (GI) carcinoma (N=1). 
There was no complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) in this study as assessed according to 
RECIST 1.1. 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Bavencio in all subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of Merkel cell carcinoma, 
urothelial carcinoma, and renal cell carcinoma (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Avelumab pharmacokinetics (PK) was assessed using a population PK approach for avelumab as 
monotherapy and avelumab in combination with axitinib. 
Based on a population PK analysis for avelumab as monotherapy and in combination with axitinib, 
there are no expected clinically meaningful differences in exposure of avelumab between settings 
administered every 2 weeks at 800 mg or 10 mg/kg. 
Distribution 
Avelumab is expected to be distributed in the systemic circulation and to a lesser extent in the 
extracellular space. The volume of distribution at steady state was 4.72 L. 
Consistent with a limited extravascular distribution, the volume of distribution of avelumab at steady 
state is small. As expected for an antibody, avelumab does not bind to plasma proteins in a specific 
manner. 
Elimination 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis from 1 629 patients, the value of total systemic 
clearance (CL) is 0.59 L/day. In the supplemental analysis, avelumab CL was found to decrease over 
time: the largest mean maximal reduction (% coefficient of variation [CV%]) from baseline value with 
different tumour types was approximately 32.1% (CV 36.2%). 
Steady-state concentrations of avelumab were reached after approximately 4 to 6 weeks (2 to 3 cycles) 
of repeated dosing at 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, and systemic accumulation was approximately 
1.25-fold. 
The elimination half-life (t½) at the recommended dose is 6.1 days based on the population PK 
analysis. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
The exposure of avelumab increased dose-proportionally in the dose range of 10 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg 
every 2 weeks. 
When avelumab 10 mg/kg was administered in combination with axitinib 5 mg, the respective 
exposures of avelumab and axitinib were unchanged compared to the single agents. There was no 
evidence to suggest a clinically relevant change of avelumab clearance over time in patients with 
advanced RCC. 
Special populations 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis suggested no difference in the total systemic clearance of 
avelumab based on age, gender, race, PD-L1 status, tumour burden, renal impairment and mild or 
moderate hepatic impairment. 
Total systemic clearance increases with body weight. Steady-state exposure was approximately 
uniform over a wide range of body weights (30 to 204 kg) for body weight normalised dosing. 
Renal impairment 
No clinically important differences in the clearance of avelumab were found between patients with 
mild (glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 60 to 89 mL/min, Cockcroft-Gault Creatinine Clearance 
(CrCL); n=623), moderate (GFR 30 to 59 mL/min, n=320) and patients with normal (GFR 
≥ 90 mL/min, n=671) renal function. 
Avelumab has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment (GFR 15 to 29 mL/min). 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
No clinically important differences in the clearance of avelumab were found between patients with 
mild hepatic impairment (bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN or bilirubin between 1 and 1.5 times ULN, 
n=217) and normal hepatic function (bilirubin and AST ≤ ULN, n=1 388) in a population PK analysis. 
Hepatic impairment was defined by National Cancer Institute (NCI) criteria of hepatic dysfunction. 
Avelumab has not been studied in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (bilirubin between 1.5 
and 3 times ULN) or severe hepatic impairment (bilirubin > 3 times ULN). 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of avelumab was evaluated in 21 children and adolescents from 3 years to 
17 years in study MS100070-0306 receiving either 10 mg/kg (N=6) or 20 mg/kg (N=15) avelumab 
intravenously every 2 weeks until confirmed progression, death, or unacceptable toxicity. 
The paediatric PK parameters and the corresponding PK profiles for all patients were evaluated 
according to dosing and stratified by bodyweight. 
The exposure in paediatric patients receiving 20 mg/kg avelumab were similar or higher compared to 
those in adults receiving 10 mg/kg or 800 mg avelumab. In paediatric patients receiving 10 mg/kg 
avelumab the exposure was lower compared to those in adults. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose 
toxicity in Cynomolgus monkeys administered intravenously doses of 20, 60 or 140 mg/kg once a 
week for1 month and 3 months, followed by a 2-month recovery period after the 3-month dosing 
period. Perivascular mononuclear cell cuffing was observed in the brain and spinal cord of monkeys 
treated with avelumab at ≥ 20 mg/kg for 3 months. Although there was no clear dose-response 
relationship, it cannot be excluded that this finding was related to avelumab treatment. 
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with avelumab. The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is 
thought to be involved in maintaining tolerance to the foetus throughout pregnancy. Blockade of 
PD-L1 signalling has been shown in murine models of pregnancy to disrupt tolerance to the foetus and 
to result in an increase in foetal loss. These results indicate a potential risk that administration of 
avelumab during pregnancy could cause foetal harm, including increased rates of abortion or stillbirth. 
No studies have been conducted to assess the potential of avelumab for carcinogenicity or 
genotoxicity. 
Fertility studies have not been conducted with avelumab. In 1-month and 3-month repeat-dose 
toxicology studies in monkeys, there were no notable effects in the female reproductive organs. Many 
of the male monkeys used in these studies were sexually immature and thus no explicit conclusions 
regarding effects on male reproductive organs can be made.

Handling instructions 
An aseptic technique for the preparation of the solution for infusion should be used. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The vial should be visually inspected for particulate matter and discoloration. Bavencio is a 
clear, colourless to slightly yellow solution. If the solution is cloudy, discoloured, or contains 
particulate matters, the vial should be discarded. 
An infusion bag of appropriate size (preferably 250 mL) containing either sodium chloride 
9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or with sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution for 
injection should be used. The required volume of Bavencio should be withdrawn from the 
vial(s) and transferred to the infusion bag. Any partially used or empty vials have to be 
discarded. 
The diluted solution should be mixed by gently inverting the bag in order to avoid foaming or 
excessive shearing of the solution. 
The solution should be inspected to ensure it is clear, colourless, and free of visible particles. 
The diluted solution should be used immediately once prepared. 
Do not co-administer other medicinal products through the same intravenous line. Administer 
the solution for infusion using a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low-protein binding 0.2 micrometre 
in-line or add-on filter as described in section 4.2. 
After administration of Bavencio, the line should be flushed with either sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for injection or with sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution for injection. 
Do not freeze or shake the diluted solution. If refrigerated, allow the diluted solution in the intravenous 
bags to come to room temperature prior to use. 
Disposal 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Bavencio is and what it is used for 
Bavencio contains the active substance avelumab, a monoclonal antibody (a type of protein) that 
attaches to a specific target in the body called PD-L1. 
PD-L1 is found on the surface of certain tumour cells, and helps protect them from the immune system 
(the body’s natural defences). Bavencio binds to PD-L1, and blocks this protective effect, allowing the 
immune system to attack the tumour cells. 
Bavencio is used in adults to treat: 
• 
Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), a rare type of skin cancer, when it is metastatic (has spread to 
other parts of the body). 
Urothelial carcinoma (UC), a cancer that originates in the urinary tract, when it is advanced 
or metastatic (has spread beyond the urinary bladder or to other parts of the body). Bavencio is 
used as maintenance treatment if the tumour has not grown after so called platinum-based 
chemotherapy as the first treatment.  
Renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a type of kidney cancer, when it is advanced (has spread beyond 
the kidney or to other parts of the body). 
• 
• 
For renal cell cancer, Bavencio is to be used in combination with axitinib. 
It is important that you also read the package leaflet for the medicine containing axitinib. If you have 
any questions about axitinib, ask your doctor. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Bavencio 
Do not use Bavencio 
if you are allergic to avelumab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
Blood tests and weight checks: 
Your doctor will check your general health before and during treatment with Bavencio. 
You will have blood tests during your treatment and your doctor will monitor your weight before and 
during treatment. 
Talk to your doctor before receiving Bavencio: 
It may cause side effects (see section 4). Please note that in some cases symptoms may be delayed, and 
may develop after your last dose. If you suffer from any of these you should seek urgent medical 
attention: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
infusion-related reactions; 
problems due to inflammation of your lungs (pneumonitis); 
inflammation of your liver (hepatitis) or other liver problems; 
inflammation of your intestines (colitis), diarrhoea (watery, loose or soft stools) or more bowel 
movements than usual; 
inflammation of your pancreas (pancreatitis); 
inflammation of your heart (myocarditis); 
problems with your hormone producing glands (the thyroid, adrenal and pituitary glands) that 
may affect how these glands work; 
Type 1 diabetes, including a serious, sometimes life-threatening problem due to acid in the 
blood produced from diabetes (diabetic ketoacidosis); 
problems with your kidneys; 
inflammation of your muscles (myositis); 
problems due to inflammation of your lungs, skin, eyes and/or lymph nodes (sarcoidosis). 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If you experience any of these symptoms when taking Bavencio do not try to treat them on your own 
with other medicines. Your doctor may 
• 
• 
• 
give you other medicines in order to prevent complications and reduce your symptoms, 
withhold the next dose of Bavencio, 
or stop your treatment with Bavencio altogether. 
Check with your doctor or nurse before you receive Bavencio if: 
• 
• 
you have an autoimmune disease (a condition where the body attacks its own cells); 
you have human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or acquired immune deficiency 
syndrome (AIDS); 
you have ever had chronic viral infection of the liver, including hepatitis B (HBV) or hepatitis C 
(HCV); 
you receive medicines to suppress your immune system; 
you have had an organ transplant. 
• 
• 
• 
Bavencio acts on your immune system. It may cause inflammation in parts of your body. Your risk of 
these side effects may be higher if you already have an autoimmune disease (a condition where the 
body attacks its own cells). You may also experience frequent flares of your autoimmune disease, 
which in the majority of cases are mild. 
Children and adolescents 
Bavencio has not been studied in children and adolescents below 18 years of age. 
Other medicines and Bavencio 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Pregnancy 
Bavencio can cause harm to your unborn baby. If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are 
planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
You must not use Bavencio if you are pregnant unless your doctor specifically recommends it. 
If you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must use effective contraceptives while you are 
being treated with Bavencio and for at least 1 month after your last dose. 
Breast-feeding 
If you are breast-feeding, tell your doctor. 
Do not breast-feed while receiving Bavencio and for at least 1 month after your last dose. 
It is unknown if Bavencio passes into your breast milk. A risk to the breast-fed child cannot be 
excluded. 
Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or use machines after you have received Bavencio if you are not feeling well enough. 
Tiredness is a very common side effect of Bavencio and can affect your ability to drive or to use 
machines. 
Bavencio has a low sodium content 
Bavencio contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) in each dose and therefore is essentially 
sodium-free. 
3. 
How to use Bavencio 
You will receive Bavencio in a hospital or clinic, under the supervision of an experienced doctor. 
How much Bavencio you will receive 
The recommended dose of avelumab is 800 mg every 2 weeks. Your doctor will decide how many 
treatments you need. 
How you will receive Bavencio 
You will receive Bavencio as an infusion (a drip) into a vein (intravenously) over a period of 1 hour. 
Bavencio will be added to an infusion bag containing a sodium chloride solution before use. 
Before you receive Bavencio 
For at least the first 4 treatments, you will receive paracetamol and an antihistamine before being 
given Bavencio, to help to prevent possible side effects related to the infusion. Depending on how 
your body responds to treatment, your doctor may decide to continue giving you these medicines 
before all of your Bavencio treatments. 
If you miss a dose of Bavencio 
It is very important for you to keep all your appointments to receive Bavencio. If you miss an 
appointment, ask your doctor when to schedule your next dose. 
If you stop receiving Bavencio 
Do not stop treatment with Bavencio unless you have discussed this with your doctor. Stopping your 
treatment may stop the effect of the medicine. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. Some side 
effects may happen weeks or months after your last dose. 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bavencio acts on your immune system and may cause inflammation in parts of your body (see 
section 2). Inflammation may cause serious damage to your body and some inflammatory conditions 
may lead to death and need treatment or withdrawal of Bavencio.

Handling instructions 
Preparation and administration 
An aseptic technique for the preparation of the solution for infusion should be used. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The vial should be visually inspected for particulate matter and discoloration. Bavencio is a 
clear, colourless to slightly yellow solution. If the solution is cloudy, discoloured, or contains 
particulate matters, the vial should be discarded. 
An infusion bag of appropriate size (preferably 250 mL) containing either sodium chloride 
9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection or with sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution for 
injection should be used. The required volume of Bavencio should be withdrawn from the 
vial(s) and be transferred to the infusion bag. Any partially used or empty vials have to be 
discarded. 
The diluted solution should be mixed by gently inverting the bag in order to avoid foaming or 
excessive shearing of the solution. 
The solution should be inspected to ensure it is clear, colourless, and free of visible particles. 
The diluted solution should be used immediately once prepared. 
Do not co-administer other medicinal products through the same intravenous line. Administer 
the infusion using a sterile, non-pyrogenic, low-protein binding 0.2 micrometre in-line or add-
on filter. 
After administration of Bavencio, the line should be flushed with either sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for injection or with sodium chloride 4.5 mg/mL (0.45%) solution for injection.

Do not freeze or shake the diluted solution. If refrigerated, allow the diluted solution in the intravenous 
bags to come to room temperature prior to use. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for avelumab, the scientific 
conclusions of PRAC are as follows: 
Patients with pre-existing autoimmune disease 
In view of available data on immune-related adverse reactions in patients with pre-existing 
autoimmune disease from the literature, and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the PRAC 
Rapporteur considers a causal relationship between avelumab and an increased risk of immune-related 
adverse reaction in patients with pre-existing autoimmune disease is at least a reasonable possibility. 
The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing avelumab should be 
amended accordingly. 
Sarcoidosis 
In view of available data on sarcoidosis from clinical trials, the literature and spontaneous reports 
including in some cases a close temporal relationship, and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, 
the PRAC considers a causal relationship between avelumab and sarcoidosis is at least a reasonable 
possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing avelumab 
should be amended accordingly. 
Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions 
and grounds for recommendation. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for avelumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing avelumab is unchanged subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

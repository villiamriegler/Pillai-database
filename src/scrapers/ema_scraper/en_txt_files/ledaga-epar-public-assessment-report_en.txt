2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Cutaneous T-cell lymphomas (CTCL) are a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative diseases characterised 
by infiltration of the skin by malignant T-cells. The epidermotropic form of CTCL is the most common and is 
referred to as mycosis fungoides (MF), accounting for 60% of new CTCL cases. CTCL is a rare type of tumour and 
the RARECARE cancer1 registry reports a combined incidence rate of 0.52/100,000 for MF-type CTCL and the 
more aggressive Sézary Syndrome. It is estimated that the 5-year partial prevalence of MF-type CTCL is 11,735 
in EU-28 countries2. Overall survival as well as disease-specific survival decrease with advancing clinical stage. 
In treated patients, median survival with early stage disease (Stage IA, IB and IIA) is reported as 35.5, 21.5 and 
15.8 years, respectively3. The prognosis for patients with MF-type CTCL is worse when the condition is not 
limited to the skin at the time of initial diagnosis (Stages IIB through IV). Median survival for late stage disease 
(Stages IIB, IIIA and IIIB) is reported to be 4.7, 4.7 and 3.4 years, respectively, and decreases further for Stage 
IV disease3. 
The etiology of MF is not known. MF commonly begins with a nonspecific scaly eruption that leads to the 
development of patches/plaques. With further progress, the disease advances with the formation of tumours, 
generalized erythroderma often with a leukemic phase (Sézary syndrome) and lymphadenopathy. Eventually, 
wide-spread visceral lymphoma may lead to death from the disease. Ulceration of tumours, with secondary 
infection with Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, is also a common 
cause of morbidity and death. The diagnosis is made with skin biopsy and is further confirmed with 
immunophenotyping and DNA analysis of the T-cell receptor gene rearrangement to define the clonal 
population. Lymph node biopsies may be performed at initial staging in patients with overt advanced disease or 
if nodes are enlarged on physical examination or imaging studies. Peripheral blood is examined for the presence 
of circulating malignant cells which would serve to identify the leukemia expression of the Sézary syndrome.  
Clinical staging serves to distinguish prognostic groups, where good-risk patients, who have plaque-only disease 
without lymph node, blood or visceral involvement have a better prognosis than intermediate-risk patients, with 
tumors, erythroderma or plaque disease with lymph node or blood involvement (with no visceral involvement), 
and poor-risk patients (with visceral involvement). Staging of patients with MF is essential not only for 
assessment of prognosis but also for decisions in management. The goals of treatment of patch/plaque disease 
without lymph node involvement (IA and IB), and those with enlarged but histologically uninvolved lymph nodes 
(IIA), is to achieve remission, relieve symptoms and achieve cosmetic improvement while avoiding long-term

treatment-related toxicities. For patients with Stage IA, IB or IIA disease, management relies on the 
applications of skin directed therapies. The therapeutic options include topical corticosteroids, topical 
chemotherapy with chlormethine (also known as nitrogen mustard (NM) or mechlorethamine) or carmustine 
(BCNU), ultraviolet B (UVB) therapy, psoralen plus ultraviolet A radiation (PUVA) and total skin electron beam 
therapy. Targretin (bexarotene), an orally available capsule for systemic therapy, is indicated for advanced 
stage cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) in adult patients. Topical chlormethine is included in the EORTC 
(2006), the ESMO (2013) and NCCN (2014) guidelines as a first line therapy for early stage MF-type CTCL and 
for the treatment of cutaneous lesions in late stage MF-type CTCL. 
About the product 
Chlormethine is an alkylating agent that inhibits rapidly proliferating cells (ATC code L01AA05) and is used for 
the topical treatment of mycosis fungoides (MF)-type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (MF-type CTCL). Chemically, 
the cytotoxicity of chlormethine is due to its spontaneous conversion to an electrophilic intermediate that 
covalently binds to cellular components. The highly reactive intermediate is an aziridinium ion formed by 
cyclisation of one of the side chains and displacement of a chloride ion4,5,6,7,8. Chlormethine has two reactive 
2-chloroethyl side chains, classifying it as a bifunctional alkylating agent. 
Alkylation of DNA is the primary basis for the cytotoxic actions of chlormethine. Chlormethine binds to N7 
positions in guanines via its reactive chloroethyl moieties, potentially binding also to N3 positions in 
adenines9, 10. The bifunctional nature of chlormethine along with its small molecular size allows it to form 
interstrand cross-links within DNA, by alkylation of guanine-N7 positions in opposite DNA strands. Monoadducts 
and intrastrand biadducts are also formed, but the formation of interstrand cross-links makes chlormethine a 
more effective tumor chemotherapeutic agent than monofunctional analogues11. Unrepaired interstrand 
cross-links prevent transcription, replication, and segregation of DNA, and ultimately cause cell death12. There 
are numerous reports showing a correlation between the extent of DNA cross-linking and cytotoxicity13 ; 
conversely, tumour resistance to bifunctional alkylating agents has been associated with increased capacity to 
repair DNA cross-links14. Defects in cell-cycle regulation that lead to cell-cycle progression before DNA damage 
can be repaired may also contribute to the sensitivity of cancer cells to these drugs15,16. Cell death caused by 
chlormethine may occur by multiple mechanisms leading to apoptosis or necrosis17,18,19.

Type of Application and aspects on development 
The application was submitted under Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. The reference medicinal product is 
Caryolysine, an aqueous formulation of chlormethine that was first authorised for the treatment of MF-type 
CTCL in France in 1949. Although Caryolysine still holds a valid license in France, it has not been marketed since 
2006. Both Caryolysine and Ledaga contain the same active substance, the same strength, same route of 
administration and with the same proposed indication. However, the pharmaceutical form is different, whereas 
Caryolysine is a concentrate solution for dilution in water or sodium chloride, Ledaga is produced as a gel with 
other excipients. The applicant has claimed that bioequivalence cannot be demonstrated through bioavailability 
studies as the treatment is for topical use (EMA/CHMP/QWP/558185/2014) and no systemic exposure can be 
observed (see non-clinical discussion and clinical pharmacology discussion). The application is based on two  
studies, a multi-center, randomised, active controlled, non-inferiority clinical pivotal trial comparing Ledaga with 
chlormethine compounded in petroleum-based 0.02% chlormethine HCl ointment  and an uncontrolled, 
multi-center, open-label extension of the pivotal study.  
The Applicant has applied for the following indication: 
“Chlormethine gel is indicated for the topical treatment of mycosis fungoides-type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in 
adult patients.” 
The agreed indication is as follows: 
Ledaga is indicated for the topical treatment of mycosis fungoides-type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (MF-type 
CTCL) in adult patients (see section 5.1). 
Posology is proposed as follows: 
A thin film of Ledaga should be applied once daily to affected areas of the skin. 
Treatment with Ledaga should be stopped for any grade of skin ulceration or blistering, or moderately severe or 
severe dermatitis (e.g., marked skin redness with oedema). Upon improvement, treatment with Ledaga can be 
restarted at a reduced frequency of once every 3 days. If reintroduction of treatment is tolerated for at least 1 
week, the frequency of application can be increased to every other day for at least 1 week and then to once-daily 
application if tolerated.

2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of chlormethine hydrochloride is 2-chloro-N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-methylethanamine 
hydrochloride or 2,2’-dichloro-N-methyldiethylamine hydrochloride or bis(2-chloroethyl)methylamine 
hydrochloride or N-methylbis(2-chloroethyl)amine hydrochloride corresponding to the molecular formula 
C5H11Cl 2N
HCl and has a relative molecular mass 192.51 g/mol. The structure is shown is Figure 1:

Figure 1: 
Structure of chlormethine hydrochloride 
The structure of chlormethine hydrochloride was elucidated by using: chloride titration, elemental analysis, 
purity by gas chromatography, FT-IR spectroscopy, mass spectroscopy, 1H NMR spectroscopy, DSC melting 
point, thermogravimetric analysis, and X-Ray powder diffraction. 
Chlormethine hydrochloride is a white to off-white, crystalline hygroscopic solid compound, which is very slightly 
soluble in water, partially soluble in ethanol and soluble in acetone. The active substance does not exhibit 
stereoisomerism. 
Polymorphism was determined by XRPD (X-ray Powder Diffraction analysis), data shown that although different 
crystallization principles and solvents were used, the same polymorph was obtained. Therefore, these data 
demonstrate that the same polymorphic form is constantly produced.   
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The  chlormethine  hydrochloride  manufacturing  process  consists  of  one  chemical  step  starting  from  a 
commercially  available  starting  material,  N-methyldiethanolamine  (MDEA).  During  evaluation,  the  CHMP 
requested to redefine MDEA as starting material, the applicant performed additional investigations in order to 
support the definition of MDEA as starting material following the principles of ICH guideline Q11. As a result of 
these investigations, the specifications for MDEA and chlormethine hydrochloride were significantly revised and 
in addition the distillation step of MDEA was defined and implemented as the first step of the synthesis of the 
active substance; these measures were considered satisfactory and MDEA was accepted as a starting material. 
However,  although  satisfactory,  preliminary  validation  data  have  been  presented  sufficient  to  give  some 
assurance that full validation is likely to be achievable, the validation data to support the proposed methods for 
control of impurities in MDEA has not been completed.  Therefore, the CHMP recommends that the validation 
data should be completed before the marketing of the product.  
Adequate  in-process  controls  are  applied  during  the  synthesis.  The  specifications  and  control  methods  for 
starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The  characterisation  of  the  active  substance  and  its  impurities  are  in  accordance  with  the  EU  guideline  on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised.

The  active  substance  is  packaged  in  an  amber  glass  jar,  sealed  with  a  PTFE-lined,  threaded  polypropylene 
screw-on cap which complies with the Ph Eur 3.2.1. and Regulation 2023/2006/EC. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identification (IR, colorimetry), meting range 
(DSC), water content (Karl Fischer), pH, chloride (titration), assay (titration), related substances (GCs and ion 
chromatography), residual solvents (GCs), microbial limits (Ph. Eur.).  
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological 
and  clinical  studies  and  appropriate  specifications  have  been  set  taking  into  account  ICH  S9  and  M7  and 
considering that chlormethine hydrochloride active substance intended for advanced cancer indications and is 
itself  genotoxic  at  therapeutic  dose.  The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and 
non-compendia methods were appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. except for titration  
(chloride content), GC  (related substances), GC (resisual solvents), and ion chromatography (chloride content)   
Satisfactory preliminary validation data for this analytical methods of active substance and starting materials 
have been presented but the complete validation has not been completed.  The CHMP recommended completing 
the validation data for these methods post authorisation. The CHMP also recommended to provide comparative 
batch  analysis  (for  all  parameters  tested)  by  the  active  substance  and  finished  product  manufacturers. 
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used has been presented. 
Batch  analysis  data  of  the  active  substance  were  provided.  The  results  are  within  the  specifications  and 
consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in 
the intended commercial package for 48 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: assay, appearance, water content, pH and levels of individual and total 
impurities. 
At both storage conditions (long term and accelerated) over the storage periods, all parameters complied with 
specification.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is sufficiently 
stable.  The  stability  results  justify  the  proposed  retest  period  of  60  months  at  the  recommended  storage 
condition (25°C/60% RH) in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
The finished product is presented as a clear, free of particles, colourless gel, packaged in a re-sealable, 
aluminium tube, containing 60 g of gel for cutaneous use. 
The goal of the pharmaceutical development was to provide a non-greasy, chemically stable, single phase 
cutaneous presentation in which the active substance is held in solution, and which dries rapidly upon 
application to the skin. 
The active substance, chlormethine hydrochloride is known to be readily soluble in water and alcohols and 
therefore hydrophilic alcohol-based solvents were selected for the formulation in order to achieve a uniform

product. The physical characteristics of the active substance do not affect the formulation since the active 
substance is highly soluble in the solvents used in the finished product formulation. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. 
There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The formulation used in the pivotal clinical trial is the same as the proposed commercial formulation. 
A  topical  chlormethine  hydrochloride  formulation  was  developed  using  diethylene  glycol  monoethyl  ether 
(DEGEE),  glycerin,  propylene  glycol  and  isopropanol  base.  Compared  to  other  topical  formulations  the 
developed formulation was considered improved on a number of characteristics and attributes appropriate for a 
topically administered anti-cancer product, including viscosity, drying time and lack of greasiness . Satisfactory 
studies have been performed to assure chlormethine hydrochloride remains solubilised in individual formulation 
components and final formulation base, during manufacture and over shelf-life.  Data  has been provided to 
assure  that  the  active  substance  does  not  crystallise  and  that  the  formulation  does  not  undergo  phase 
separation  under  freeze-thaw  conditions.  Substantial  data  have  been  provided  to  demonstrate  formulation 
understanding and provide assurance that the formulation is robust and fit for purpose.   
The  physical  and  chemical  characteristics  of  the  finished  product  formulation  are  that  of  a  solution  wherein 
approximately 97.7% (on a mass basis) of the materials are miscible with each other. The vast majority of the 
solids  come  from  hydroxypropyl  cellulose,  which  is  the  gelling  agent.  Optical  microscopy  was  conducted  on 
multiple batches. The samples were examined using a polarizing light microscope at up to 200 × magnification. 
There was no evidence of chlormethine hydrochloride visible particles observed in the samples. Furthermore, no 
evidence  of  multiple  phases  was  observed.  Sub-visible  birefringent  crystals  and/or  sub-visible  particles 
observed  in  the  samples  were  analysed  by  infrared  spectroscopy  and  identified  as  formulation  excipients 
(glycerol,  edetate  disodium  and  hydroxypropyl  cellulose).  Therefore,  it  was  demonstrated  that  the  active 
substance is fully soluble in the formulation and therefore the dosage form is considered a gel according to 
EDQM standard terms and Ph. Eur. monograph on semi-solid preparation for cutaneous application. 
This  non-sterile  topical  gel  is  largely  alcoholic,  containing  a  very  limited  amount  of  water  (<  2.0%).    No 
antimicrobial agents are incorporated as the finished product is acknowledged to be essentially self-preserving. 
The  microbiological  requirements  of  the  Ph.  Eur.  (5.1.4)  for  preparations  for  cutaneous  use  are,  therefore, 
applied. Tests for efficacy of antimicrobial preservation have been performed as part of development studies for 
clinical batches at 12-32 months following manufacture and on three batches of product, manufactured at the 
proposed commercial scale and facility at 5-7 months following manufacture.  All results comply with Ph. Eur. 
requirements and demonstrate efficacy of antimicrobial preservation. 
The finished product is packaged into aluminium foil tubes with a white exterior coating and lacquer interior 
coating. The dispensing end of the tube is sealed with an aluminium film and a white resealable screw-on cap. 
Product compatibility with the primary packaging components can be extrapolated from the finished release 
testing and stability testing results which show no indication of incompatibility. The lacquer complies with EU 
Directive  2002/72/EC  as  suitable  for  food  contact.  Given  the  potential  hazards  of  this  medicinal  product, 
particularly  to  the  eyes,  coupled  with  its  proposed  use  with  domestic  setting,  a  transparent  sealable 
child-resistant  plastic  bag  is  provided.  Each  tube  will  be  placed  in  the  transparent  plastic  bag  before  being 
delivered  to  the  patient.  To  support  the  claim  of  child  resistance  for  the  re-closable  plastic  bag,  the  CHMP 
recommended providing a certificate demonstrating compliance with BS EN ISO 8317 for re-closable packaging 
before the marketing of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/653881/2017 
Page 12/76 
  
  
The finished product is manufactured by producing sub-parts of the bulk gel and combining them followed by 
tube filling.  
In-process controls of critical quality attributes (appearance, viscosity and homogeneity of chlormethine content 
assay) are described and are considered sufficient. Appropriate process validation has been performed in three 
batches at the proposed commercial scale.  Process times and mixing speeds are reasonably consistent between 
batches.  Results  for  in-process  controls  and  ancillary  test  parameters  are  generally  consistent  within  and 
between batches.  For the bulk finished product, stratified sampling shows chlormethine assay values to be 
reproducible  as  are  content  of  butyl  hydroxytoluene  and  water  content.    Results  for  viscosity  are  similarly 
reproducible. The filling process is uniform, with fill weight reproducibility demonstrated across a range of filling 
speeds. However, the CHMP recommended performing quantitative cleaning validation during commercial-scale 
validation studies to support the proposed process to cleanse finished product residues from the exterior of the 
tube prior to labelling. Supplementary process validation data was presented for a further three batches which 
used the minimum, maximum and mid-point respectively of proposed mixing time and tube filling speed ranges.  
These  data  are  consistent  with  those  of  the  primary  process  validation  batches.  Satisfactory  data  were 
presented to support the proposed bulk hold times.  
All in-process controls are adequate for this pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance, 
viscosity  (Ph.  Eur.),  identity  (HPLC/mass  spectrometry),  water  content  (Karl  Fischer),  identification  of 
butylhydroxytoluene  (HPLC),  assay  (HPLC/mass  spectrometry),  impurities  (HPLC/mass  spectrometry),  tube 
uniformity  (HPLC),  minimum  fill  (gravimetry),  uniformity  of  dosage  unit  by  mass  variation  (Ph.  Eur.)  and 
microbial limits (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards has been presented. The finished 
product  will  be  released  on  the  market  based  on  the  above  release  specifications,  through  traditional  final 
product release testing. 
Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  for  3  commercial  scale  batches  confirming  the  consistency  of  the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data on 3 commercial scale batches of finished product stored under long term conditions for 36 months 
at −25 to −15 °C and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 2 to 8 °C according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided. The batches of the medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were 
packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, viscosity, water content, butylated hydroxytoluene content and assayThe 
analytical procedures used were the same as for release and are stability indicating. 
At the recommended long-term storage condition, all data remain within the  proposed specifications. These 
results showed that the product is stable when stored at the proposed long-term conditions. 
Under accelerated storage conditions, no specific change nor trend is observed. However, an increase of several 
specified impurities and of the total impurities is observed. All data remain below the specification limit. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/653881/2017 
Page 13/76 
  
  
Studies were conducted to determine the effect of temperature on the finished product when cycled between 
refrigerated  and  room  temperature  conditions.  Three  batches  of  the  finished  product  tubes  are  punctured, 
finished product content is dispensed from the tube, and then the tube is resealed with the tube cap closure. The 
tubes were exposed to conditions of 25 °C / 60% RH for 1 hour/day and then returned to refrigeration (2 to 8 °C) 
for up 16 weeks. No trend was observed. Stability-indicating impurities do show an increase over time, although 
all results remain within specification. 
In  order  to  confirm  that  the  product  behaves  as  predicted  by  all  other  stability  data  when  the  temperature 
transition  occurs,  additional  studies  have  been  conducted  in  which  product  has  been  stored  at  long-term 
conditions (−25 to −15 °C) for up to 18 months and then transferred to + 2 to +  8 °C for 6 months. The 
obtained stability data demonstrated that all results remain within the finished product specification. 
A study of the finished product exposed to light under controlled light exposure per ICH Q1B method-defined 
conditions was conducted. These data support the conclusion that the primary packaging (tube) adequately 
protects the finished product from potential light exposure.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months when stored in the freezer (-15°C to –
25°C) and 60 days in the refrigerator (+2°C to +8°C) after defrosting as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are 
acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. However a number of issues were recommended by the CHMP in relation to 
completion of analytical methods of the starting material and active substance, comparative batch analysis (for 
all parameters tested) by the active substance and finished product manufacturers, validation of cleaning of 
exterior of the tube and certification of compliance for the child-resistant re-closable bag.  The results of tests 
carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn 
lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on 
the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  Complete full analytical test method validation for: 
•  MDEA GC method 1 (related substances) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/653881/2017 
Page 14/76 
  
  
•  MDEA GC method 2 (ethylene oxide) 
•  GC (NM-OH in the drug substance) 
•  GC/MS (benzene, carbon tetrachloride and 1,2-dichloroethane in the drug substance) 
• 
Ion chromatography (thionyl chloride in the drug substance) 
•  GC1 (individual and unspecified impurities in the drug substance) 
•  Chloride titration 1 (chloride content of the drug substance) 
2. 
Provide comparative batch analysis (for all parameters tested) by the active substance and finished 
product manufacturers. 
3. 
Perform validation of cleaning of exterior of tube prior to labelling as part of commercial-scale validation 
studies. 
4. 
Provide certification of compliance to BS EN ISO 8317 for the child-resistant re-closable bag supplied 
with the finished product before the marketing of the product. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The applicant did not submit non-clinical studies. A summary of non-clinical characteristics of chlormethine were 
presented from the published literature and is described briefly in the following sections.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
The cytotoxicity of chlormethine has been investigated in a number of human cell lines, and low IC50 values were 
shown for all. In the human colon adenocarcinoma cell line LS174T, the IC50 value was 0.27 µM using the 
sulphorhodamine B assay. The two human colon carcinoma cell lines Colo320DM and Colo320HSR, the human 
histiocytic lymphoma cell line U937, and the human leukemic T-cell lymphoblast cell line J6 had IC50 values of 
1.0, 0.79, 4.1 and 0.55 µM, respectively, using a tetrazolium (MTT)-based colorimetric assay20. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Not available (see non-clinical discussion). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Systemic administration of lethal or supra-lethal doses of chlormethine consistently produced adverse effects on 
the central nervous system in experimental animals. An i.v. injection of 20 mg/kg chlormethine to rabbits 
produced incoordination along with brief convulsive running movements, salivation, urination, defecation, 
lacrimation, bronchorrhea, and mioisis within 5 to 15 min of dosing. In mice, subcutaneous injection of 20 mg/kg 
and above produced tremors, depression, and intermittent convulsive activity followed later in survivors by 
incoordination, severe tremors, over-reaction to stimuli, coldness, diarrhoea, and retropulsive movements. Rats

surviving 3 to 4 days after an i.v. injection (dose not specified) exhibited increased irritability and abnormal 
movements, which was usually followed by death. Among survivors with less severe effects, hyperirritability 
persisting for weeks remained the only sign of injury. Extensive demyelination of the peripheral nerves was 
observed in a third of the rats21. 
In another study22 , rats receiving a single i.v. dose of 0.16 mM/kg (approximately equivalent to 32 mg/kg) 
chlormethine HCl exhibited progressive muscular paralysis and terminal convulsive seizures prior to death 
within 2 to 4 h. i.v. doses of less than 0.02 mM/kg caused some delayed deaths. In cats, single i.v. doses of 0.04 
and 0.08 mM/kg (approximately equivalent to 8 and 16 mg/kg) rapidly produced signs of licking, vomiting, 
salivation, and loose stools. From 20 to 30 min post-dosing, neurological changes starting with an inability to 
support the head were observed, followed by progressive paralysis with gross incoordination, asynergia, 
tremors, dilated pupils, profuse salivation, and complete prostration. Knee jerks were observed throughout 
paralysis, but without signs of muscular fasciculation or specific disturbance of placing or righting reflexes. 
Deaths occurred in less than 18 h. At 0.02 mM/kg, symptoms within 10 minutes of dosing included licking, 
vomiting, salivation, and loose stools. No paralysis was observed and convulsions were noted in only 1 of 3 cats 
at this dose. Deaths occurred between 1 to 3 days following progressive weight loss.  
In the same study, a fall in blood pressure was observed in the cat following an i.v. dose of 0.01 mM/kg 
chlormethine22 . Responses to vagal stimulation and to injected acetylcholine were not significantly altered by 
this dose. An i.v. dose of 0.02 mM/kg abolished the circulatory response to vagal stimulation but had no 
significant effect on responses to i.v. acetylcholine or epinephrine. Chlormethine was shown to stimulate the 
isolated rabbit and guinea pig duodenum, and these responses were prevented by adequate doses of atropine22. 
In dogs receiving a single i.v. dose of 1 mg/kg chlormethine (approximately the LD50), cardiovascular effects 
(decreased blood pressure, marked lack of oxygen saturation of the blood), reduction in body temperature, 
coldness of extremities, relaxation of anal sphincter, respiratory failure, body weight loss, terminal weakness 
and coma were observed prior to death usually between days 3 and 5 post-dosing. These effects arose 
secondary to the significant decrease in plasma and extracellular fluid volume, reduced total plasma proteins 
and chloride and reduction in red cells. These findings resulted at least in part from excessive emesis, which 
started within a few hours of dosing and increased in severity through the second and third days, and diarrhoea 
usually blood stained or frankly haemorrhagic, which occurred on the second to fourth day post-dosing. There 
was no evidence of renal vasoconstriction and renal blood flow increased in dogs at ≥24 h post-dosing; however, 
as circulatory failure occurred, renal blood flow decreased with no consistent change in the filtration fraction. No 
permanent neurological injury was observed in surviving dogs. Leucopenia was most marked on the fourth or 
fifth day postdosing. Gross pathology showed enteritis mainly in the small intestine along with effects on spleen 
and thymus, and histopathology also showed intestinal, lymphoid, and myeloid injury23.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Sensitive biomarker-based (mitotic index, protein, RNA and DNA synthesis) studies performed in mice using 
vaginal, rectal, and dermal administration indicate an absence of systemic or extended local exposure at 
doses/concentrations relevant to the therapeutic application of chlormethine gel. 
In one study, female Swiss mice received a single intravaginal administration of a 1% solution of chlormethine 
in water and the incorporation of radiolabelled protein ([3H]leucine), RNA ([3H]uridine), and DNA 
([3H]thymidine) precursors was measured as indicators of protein, RNA and DNA synthesis. Chlormethine 
completely inhibited DNA synthesis only in the vaginal cells (i.e., locally at the site of application), without 
evidence of systemic absorption (as measured by lack of effect on DNA synthesis in the rectum). Chlormethine 
did not affect RNA or protein synthesis in the vagina or rectum24. 
Inhibition of mitotic activity in the vaginal mucosa was reported in mice (n=9) receiving an intravaginal dose of 
50 μl of 0.01% chlormethine (prepared in water); no evidence of systemic exposure was observed based on an 
assessment of mitotic activity in the rectal mucosa. Conversely, when mice (n=6) received a single intra-rectal 
dose of 0.01% chlormethine, mitosis in the rectal mucosa was blocked, but not in the vaginal mucosa, again 
showing no evidence of systemic exposure25. 
Another demonstration of local, but not systemic, anti-mitotic effects of chlormethine was reported in an animal 
model whereby ultraviolet (UV) light was used to induce epidermal hyperplasia in hairless HRS/J mice26 . 
Chlormethine reduced the mitotic index and DNA synthesis only at the site of application (i.e., the neck) but had 
no effect on these parameters on a control area on the back, indicating that chlormethine effects were local and 
not systemic. 
Distribution 
Following i.v. administration, distribution of chlormethine-derived material other than to the local site has been 
reported. In mice, an i.v. dose of 35 mg/kg produced measurable levels of radioactivity in the brain, spinal cord, 
lungs, and submaxillary glands as determined by autoradiography, whereas in rats 16% of an administered dose 
(unspecified) was found in the spleen, lungs, kidneys, liver, and blood27; in dogs, a 3 mg/kg i.v. dose rapidly 
disappeared from the blood and produced low levels in tissues, with the highest levels in the bone marrow28. 
Metabolism 
In water or body fluids, chlormethine undergoes rapid chemical transformation and combines with water or 
reactive compounds of cells, so that the drug is no longer present in active form. A significant loss of toxicity 
occurred upon incubation of chlormethine in blood ex vivo prior to its injection into rats29 . The biological potency 
of chlormethine was shown to decrease rapidly as measured in mouse, cat, and rabbit arterial occlusion

models29, 30, 31,32. Longer occlusion times resulted in protection from bone marrow damage; this followed a 
dose-response31, 32. 
After topical application, chlormethine may be transformed into three of the most common chlormethine 
degradation products that are formed in aqueous solutions: the half mustard N-methyl (β- chloroethyl) 
2-hydroxyethylamine, the dimer N,N’-dimethyl-N,N’ bis(2- chloroethyl)piperazinium, and 
N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA)4 . With the exception of the dimer, these transformations are likely to occur 
within minutes after contact with body constituents. The primary transformation product, the half mustard, is 
reactive33 and will rapidly cyclize. It was shown to be at least as toxic as chlormethine in older toxicology 
studies4,34. These findings however, were not observed in the arterial occlusion and ex vivo incubation models 
described earlier in this section, in which degradation products produced significantly less mortality and toxicity. 
Neither the dimer nor MDEA showed antimitotic activity on mouse vaginal epithelium33 . MDEA exhibits minimal 
acute toxicity (oral LD50 in rats of 4.78 g/kg and topical LD50 in rabbits of 6.24 g/kg)35. 
Excretion 
Information was found on excretion of chlormethine following i.v. dosing at or above the LD50: in dogs 
administered 0.5–3 mg/kg, low levels of chlormethine were found in the urine; in rats, less than 20% of an 
administered dose of 3.3 mg/kg was recovered in the urine28; in mice, 15% of the dose (4 mg/kg) was 
eliminated as CO2, 5% in the urine, and 13% in the feces after 24 h36. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity  
Single-dose studies have been performed in mice utilizing vaginal, rectal, or other local routes of application and 
concentrations ranging from 0.01–2% chlormethine (concentrations comparable to or up to 100-fold higher 
than those in the clinical studies in MF-type CTCL). Several studies investigated the acute toxicity of 
chlormethine after dermal application. In these studies the compound was applied at very high doses and was 
formulated in solvents that increase skin permeability (e.g., DMSO, chloroform).  
Significant systemic toxicity, including mortality and local toxicity, were described after topical application of 
700-fold the estimated highest daily dose used in the clinical study with chlormethine gel. Signs of systemic 
exposure to the parent drug were not observed in animals after topical application of aqueous formulations of 
chlormethine at concentrations up to 100-fold higher than the concentration in chlormethine gel. Margins to the 
human doses are shown in Table 1

*Assuming human body weight of 60 kg, 0.016% chlormethine per g gel. † In clinical study 201. **For margin calculation, 
daily human dose was multiplied by 7. 
The topical LD50 values for chlormethine free base (≥99% pure) in two vehicles (PEG 300 and DMSO) were 
determined in female Swiss mice37 . For chlormethine in PEG 300, the LD50 was 33.6 mg/kg (corresponding to 
a local concentration of 0.5 mg/cm2). For chlormethine in DMSO, the LD50 was 20 mg/kg (corresponding to a 
local concentration of 0.3 mg/cm2). Body weights were reduced from 24 h post exposure. Death occurred within 
8 to 12 days following topical dosing. In the second phase of the study, chlormethine was administered topically 
at the LD50 dose in DMSO (i.e., at 20 mg/kg).  Body weight was significantly reduced when compared to controls 
at Days 3 (n=6) and 7 (n=4). In haematology, white blood cells (WBC) were decreased and red blood cells 
(RBC) were increased (Day 3). In clinical chemistry, alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase 
(AST) were increased (Days 3 and 7). At necropsy, decreased relative spleen weight and increased relative 
kidney weight were observed (Day 3). Furthermore, biochemical analysis of the liver revealed decreased hepatic 
glutathione (GSH) (Day 3) and oxidized glutathione (glutathione disulfide [GSSG]) (Days 3) and increased 
malondialdehyde (MDA; a measure of lipid peroxidation) (Days 3 and 7), and DNA fragmentation (Days 3 and 
7). 
In a second, similar study38, chlormethine free base (≥99% pure) was administered in DMSO as a single topical 
dose at 0 or 20 mg/kg (corresponding to a local concentration on the skin of 0.68 mg/cm2) to female Swiss mice 
(n=4 on Days 0–4, n=2 on Days 5 and 7, n=3 on Day 6). The following were observed as compared to the 
controls: body weights declined until Days 5-6; decreased WBC count from 24 h onwards with a maximum effect 
on Day 3 followed by subsequent increase; no change in RBC count or haemoglobin; decreased hepatic GSH 
within 24 h, reaching a maximum reduction on Day 7; increased glutathione dioxide at 24 h with progressive 
decreases below control levels on subsequent days; progressive increases in hepatic MDA (beginning on Day 2) 
and percent hepatic DNA damage (beginning on Day 1); no effect on liver and kidney weights; progressive 
decrease in spleen weight beginning on Day 1 until Day 4 with subsequent increase; no significant change in AST 
and ALT levels until Day 4, when the activities significantly increased; and no effect on alkaline phosphatase 
activity. In addition, in the same study, single topical doses of 5 or 10 mg/kg (n=5 or 6/group/time point, local 
concentrations on the skin were 0.17 mg/cm2 and 0.34 mg/cm2, respectively) were applied to female Swiss 
mice. Effects on WBC count, MDA, DNA damage, and spleen weight were observed, generally less pronounced 
when compared to 20 mg/kg, indicating a dose-response relationship.

In another study, female Swiss mice were treated with 20 mg/kg or DMSO as previously described39,40 . Here, 
histopathology was performed on skin, liver, spleen, and kidney. Significant histopathological findings in liver 
included granulovascular degeneration with perinuclear clumping of the cytoplasm of hepatocytes. Hepatic 
lesions were characterised by congestion and haemorrhage. Kidneys showed minimal to severe proximal tubule 
atrophy, minimal to moderate haemorrhage, and necrosis of tubular parenchymal cells. Spleens showed 
vascular congestion and increases in hematopoietic precursor cells, along with hypocellularity of white pulp 
follicles. In the treated skin, there was focal keratinocyte swelling and epidermal necrosis in the stratum 
corneum, with swollen cells throughout the epidermis. Large amounts of inflammatory cells were observed in 
the dermal region. Histopathology changes were greater by Day 7 compared to Day 3 in liver, skin, and kidneys, 
but reduced or resolved by Day 7 in the spleen. 
Tewari-Singh et al.41 reported studies in which SKH-1 hairless and C57BL/6 (haired) mice (n=5) were exposed 
topically to 200 µL acetone alone or to 3.2 mg chlormethine hydrochloride in 200 μL acetone (corresponding to 
a dose of 160 mg/kg) for 12 h, 24 h, 72 h and 120 h. Untreated controls were included in the study. Following 
the above mentioned exposures, mice were euthanised, and the dorsal skin was collected and investigated. 
Chlormethine hydrochloride treatment caused edema, erythema, microblister formation, pigmentation changes, 
dry skin, and wounding on the skin of SKH-1 hairless and C57BL/6 mice. Histopathologically, effects consisted 
of increased epidermal thickness, epidermal-dermal separation, necrotic/dead epidermis, epidermal denuding, 
scab formation, parakeratosis, hyperkeratosis, and acanthosis with hyperplasia42. 
Repeat dose toxicity  
No repeat dose toxicity studies or publications were submitted (see non-clinical discussion). 
Genotoxicity 
Fox and Scott43  and Povirk and Shuker44  have published comprehensive reviews of the mutagenicity of 
chlormethine. Reversions were reported in several bacterial and fungal strains, mutations were reported in plant 
strains, dominant and recessive lethal mutations occurred in insect strains, and dominant lethal and forward 
mutations occurred in mammalian strains. In addition, cytogenetic effects (structural and numerical 
aberrations) have been reported in plant, human, and rodent cells. These data confirm that chlormethine is 
mutagenic in bacterial, plant, and mammalian cells. 
Chlormethine was positive in the Ames assay45 . Metabolic activation was not required to produce mutagenicity. 
A dose-related increase in revertant colonies was observed at all concentrations tested (10 to 40 µg/plate). 
Similar findings were reported by Bruce and Heddle46 .

Chlormethine has been reported to induce chromosome aberrations47,48, DNA damage in vitro49,50 , and 
mutations in peripheral human lymphocytes exposed to chlormethine in vitro. The IC50 for induction of 
hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) locus mutations in the T lymphocytes was 1.34 µM for 
a 30 min exposure period. The IC50 for growth inhibition was in the range of 0.5-3.7 µM for the individual 
lymphocyte populations from nine different donors50. 
In Drosophila flies, chlormethine (0.5 and 1 mM), administered via an abdominal injection, produced an increase 
in recessive lethal mutations; mutagenic activity observed was mainly a result of the formation of DNA 
crosslinks whereas DNA monoadducts were responsible for only a minor contribution to the mutagenic activity51. 
Mutagenicity 
Male Dub:(ICR) mice were treated i.v. with chlormethine at doses ranging from 0.1 to 3.75 mg/kg and were 
mated to untreated females 7 to 20 days post-treatment to assess the occurrence of dominant lethal 
mutations52. A dose-related increase in mutations was observed in the embryos. Similar findings were reported 
when male Dub:(ICR) mice were given a single i.v. injection of 2 mg/kg and 5 weeks later were mated to 
untreated females53. The matings continued for 5 weeks. Chlormethine produced a statistically significant 
increase in dominant lethal mutations in the embryos. 
Carcinogenicity 
Zackheim and Smuckler54 investigated the carcinogenic effect of chlormethine after topical application to mice. 
Female Swiss mice were exposed topically (to the shaved mid-back) to doses of 0.1 and 0.3 mg chlormethine in 
95% ethanol (approx. 5 and 15 mg/kg, respectively) for 20 to 33 weeks. When mice were exposed to 0.3 mg 
chlormethine once per week, 8 of 24 animals developed skin tumours (7 animals with papillomas and 1 
squamous cell carcinoma) after 20 weeks of treatment. Administration of 0.1 mg chlormethine once per week 
produced no tumours in 30 animals after 33 weeks. Administration of 0.1 mg of chlormethine three times per 
week produced skin papillomas with no squamous cell carcinoma in 6/29 animals after 26 weeks of treatment. 
No skin tumours developed in the 34 controls. Irritant dermatitis, alopecia, and scarring were observed in a high 
percentage of the chlormethine-treated animals at 0.1 mg three times weekly and 0.3 mg weekly. 
Epstein55 investigated the effect of chlormethine on UVB irradiation-mediated tumour formation in hairless 
mouse skin. 0.1 mg chlormethine per animal in 95% ethanol (approx. 5 mg/kg) or vehicle were applied weekly 
for 52 weeks to the posterior halves of the backs of four groups of Ucsd (Hr) albino hairless mice (n=42 to 
2
54/group) without and with UVB irradiation (1.98 x 102 mJ/cm
, 3 times per week). Treatment with 
chlormethine/UVB resulted in faster cutaneous tumour formation than ethanol/UVB. The first skin tumours were

Furthermore, administration of chlormethine/UVB increased the tumour size as compared to ethanol/UVB.

alone without UVB irradiation produced skin tumours. The skin of the animals in these groups without UVB 
irradiation showed no gross evidence of damage, thickening, desquamation or premalignant changes at the 
termination of the study. 
In a second, similar study by Epstein56 , a higher dose of chlormethine was used compared to the study 
described above. A dose of 0.1 mg chlormethine per animal applied twice weekly without UVB produced skin 
tumours in 34% of the mice. The chlormethine treatments plus UVB radiation resulted in a significant 
acceleration of tumour formation as compared to either carcinogenic stimulus alone. The twice-weekly 
application of chlormethine in presence of UVB exposure was more tumorigenic than once-weekly application of 
chlormethine in presence of UVB. 
Reproduction toxicity 
Fertility and early embryonic development 
Chlormethine, administered to male Wistar rats via i.v. injection at doses of 0.1, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/kg every 2 
weeks for 24 weeks (i.e., 12 doses), produced significantly impaired fertility at 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg57. The effect 
was generally not reversible after 40 weeks of recovery. No fertility effects were noted at 0.1 mg/kg. Mortality 
was observed at 0.5 mg/kg, where 31% of the treated males died. There was no significant effect on numbers 
of foetal implants at any dose level. 
When chlormethine was administered as a single i.p. or i.v. injection at doses ranging from 0.02 to 4 mg/kg to 
male mice, 3 mg/kg was cytotoxic to spermatogonia and spermatocytes as assessed on Day 11. A dose-related 
decrease in sperm head count occurred at doses of 1 mg/kg and higher on Day 29; this effect was not observed 
at Day 5658 . 
Chlormethine was administered i.p. to male and female C57 BL/6J mice for 4 consecutive days at a dose of 0.5 
mg/kg. Two weeks later, treated males were mated with treated females. The pregnancy rate was 80% for 
untreated males paired with untreated females and 12.5% for treated males paired with treated females. In the 
treated groups, mean litter size was reduced and none of the offspring survived59. 
Embryo-fœtal development 
Female mice (n=78) received a single i.p. injection of 1 to 2 mg/kg on Gestation Day (GD) 10, 11, or 12 and the 
fetuses were examined on GD 14 or later60. Many of the fetuses died, but 178/475 exhibited malformations, with 
150 of the foetuses exhibiting malformations in the foot. A single s.c. injection of 2.5 mg/kg on GD 6 to 13 to 
female mice produced malformations primarily involving defects of the extremities (i.e., limbs and digits); 
embryo lethality was also observed mainly on GD 8 to 1061.

Pregnant female Swiss mice (n=4/group/timepoint) received a single i.p. injection of chlormethine (0.1 to 1 
mg/kg) on GD 11 or 12 and the embryos were harvested on GD 1262. The embryo was dispersed into a cell 
suspension and evaluated for chromosomal aberrations. Following a 6-hour exposure, the frequency of 
metaphases with chromosomal aberrations was 1.3% (untreated control), 1.2% (saline control), and 6.9, 48.7, 
and 82.5% (chlormethine at 0.1, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg, respectively). In addition, doses of 0.5 and 1 mg/kg 
increased the number of multiple aberrations and pulverized chromosomes. Similar effects were observed 
following a 2-hour exposure to 1 mg/kg and continued to be evident at times up to a 24-h exposure. Finally, 
when 5 females were dosed on GD 11 at 1 mg/kg and sacrificed on GD 19, 47 viable foetuses with a mean body 
weight of 0.9 grams were obtained with 15 resorptions and 2 late deaths. In the 5 female controls, there were 
60 viable foetuses with a mean body weight of 1.27 grams, with 1 early and 2 late deaths. Approximately 40% 
of the chlormethine-treated foetuses exhibited gross malformations, primarily in the limbs. No malformations 
occurred in the controls. 
Female rats received single s.c. injections of 1 mg/kg on GD 12, 13, 14, or 15 and the foetuses were removed 
on GD 21. Foetal mortality or resorptions were observed after treatment on GD 12 or GD 13 and abnormal 
foetuses were observed after treatment on GD 13 and 14. When the dose was split in 2 x 0.5 mg/kg over 2 days, 
no abnormalities were observed on GD 1563. A single s.c. injection of 1 mg/kg to pregnant rats on GD 12 or 13 
produced external malformations in 90% of the foetuses, including primarily general growth retardation, small 
meningocele, short mandible, syndactyly, and short kinky tail64. When the same treatment regimen was 
followed and the embryos were examined for chromosomal aberrations, the percentage of abnormal 
metaphases was 0.8% at 6 h, approximately 14% to 18% at 12 to 18 h, and approximately 3% at 24 h as 
compared to 0.1% in the controls.

DEGEE administration was well tolerated after repeated dosing. Dermal administration of 100% purified DEGEE 
up to a high dose of 1000 mg/kg/day in NZW rabbits or 40% DEGEE in water in NZW rabbits or rats did not lead 
to significant systemic toxicity. 
DEGEE was neither teratogenic nor embryotoxic in Sprague-Dawley rats dosed topically four times per day (at 
2.5 hour intervals) on GD 7 to 16 with 0.35 mL/application. Maternal weight gain was lower than in the controls 
(treated with water) which provided evidence of systemic exposure67. 
There was no evidence of in vitro or in vivo genotoxicity with DEGEE66.  
DEGEE was not carcinogenic in a GLP-compliant, 26-week topical carcinogenicity study in Tg.AC mice, in which 
DEGEE was used as the vehicle68. As detailed in a review publication69, there is no evidence for carcinogenicity 
of DEGEE based on use of 40% DEGEE in aqueous solution as an oral dose control arm in a rat study over 92 
weeks for females and 100 weeks for males. In a 52-week albino hairless mouse study in which animals were 
treated with a cumulative UV dose (600 Robertson-Berger units/week), the 5% dapsone topical gel vehicle 
containing 25% DEGEE did not cause an increased incidence of tumours or reduce time to tumor development69. 
DEGEE Exposure and safety margin assessment 
The mean daily clinical dose (DD) of chlormethine gel in the clinical trials was 2.81 g; the estimated highest daily 
dose of chlormethine gel in a single subject was 10.5 grams. DEGEE is present in the Gel at 49.91%. A dermal 
absorption of 50.4% of an applied DEGEE dose can be assumed, resulting in a mean clinically absorbed dose of 
11.8 mg/kg/day and a maximal clinically absorbed dose of 44 mg/kg/day. 
Topical administration of diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (DEGEE) to rabbits resulted in a NOAEL of 1000 
mg/kg/day in a 28-day study. When comparing the NOAEL with the estimated highest daily clinical dose of 
DEGEE with chlormethine gel, the safety margin is 22.7 based on body weight. For the mean daily clinical dose 
of 2.81 g chlormethine gel, the safety margin is 85 based on body weight. 
Oral administration of DEGEE to dogs also resulted in a NOAEL of 1000 mg/kg/day in a 90-day GLP study. The 
resulting safety margins for the estimated highest daily dose of chlormethine gel are 22.7 based on weight and 
12.6 based on human equivalent dose (HED). For the mean DD, the safety margin is 85 based on weight and 46 
based on HED. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An environmental risk assessment report was provided for evaluation of chlormethine gel. A Phase I estimation 
of exposure has been performed for chlormethine hydrochloride, since the use of chlormethine gel increases 
environmental exposure to chlormethine hydrochloride.  
Screening for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity 
According to the CHMP guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00,  1  June  2006),  drug  substances  with  a  log  Kow  >  4.5  should  be  screened  for 
persistence,  bioaccumulation  and  toxicity.  The  measurement  of  the  log  Kow  of  chlormethine  hydrochloride

should be assessed with an aqueous buffer set at a chosen pH so that mainly the neutral form of the molecule 
is present (“Shake-Flask method”, OECD 107).  
As chlormethine hydrochloride is an ionisable molecule due to a basic function with a pKa of 6.4 (TOXNET 2014), 
the neutral form of the molecule is predominant in aqueous solution at pH much above 6.4.  
Therefore the measurement must be performed at pH = 7.4 or optimally at pH = 8.4 where 99% of the molecule 
is neutral. However, a dedicated stability study of chlormethine hydrochloride in aqueous buffered solutions at 
pH = 7.4 and pH = 8.4 showed its rapid decomposition (YAU-R5624): at the time-point 0 minute, chlormethine 
hydrochloride degraded ~50% at both pH values. By 30 minutes, 1 hour and 2 hours, degradation at both pH 
values was ~90%, 98–99% and 100%, respectively. Therefore, the log Kow of chlormethine hydrochloride could 
not be determined experimentally, and only the estimated log Kow value of −1.24, was used.  
An  Fpen  default  value  of  0.01  (1%)  is  proposed  in  the  guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  of 
Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00,  1  June  2006).  However,  if  data  (reasonably 
justified market penetration data, e.g., based on published epidemiological data) are available to estimate a 
more accurate refined Fpen, this may be used. According to recent epidemiological data the number of people 
affected with MF-type CTCL in the EU-28 population is estimated to be 11,735, using available information2. This 
would correspond to an overall prevalence of MF-type CTCL in the EU of 0.22 per 10,000. This is the basis for 
estimating refined Fpen.  
The worst-case (highest) calculation of the PECSURFACEWATER is shown below.  
PECSURFACEWATER of chlormethine HCl = DOSEai × Refined Fpen  
     WASTEWinhab × DILUTION  
PECSURFACEWATER (mg/L) 
   = 2.1 × 0.000022  
200 × 10  
PECSURFACEWATER of chlormethine HCl = 0.000023 μg/L  
In the worst-case predicted surface water concentration for chlormethine hydrochloride is 435 times lower than 
this default threshold value (action limit).  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Chlormethine is a bifunctional alkylating agent that inhibits rapidly proliferating cells. Chlormethine gel, a topical 
formulation of 0.016% w/w chlormethine (0.02% w/w as chlormethine hydrochloride), has been developed for 
the treatment in adult patients of mycosis fungoides type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (MF-type CTCL). The 
applicant submitted non-clinical literature to support the application which was considered to be acceptable in 
view of the known pharmaco-toxicological properties and the extensive clinical experience with chlormethine. 
The available literature shows effects of toxic systemic doses of chlormethine on the function of vital organ 
systems. The relevance of these data (generated in the period 1947-1949) is considered to be limited as the 
investigated dose levels were often beyond the maximum tolerated dose.  Biomarker-based studies performed 
in mice using vaginal, rectal, and topical administration indicated an absence of systemic or extended local 
exposure at doses/concentrations relevant to the therapeutic application of chlormethine gel. These published 
nonclinical studies support a lack of any significant systemic exposure to chlormethine following topical 
application of chlormethine gel. Thus the lack of secondary pharmacology programme is considered acceptable. 
This conclusion is in line with ICH S7A (Safety Pharmacology Studies for Human Pharmaceuticals), which states 
in Section 2.9 that safety pharmacology studies may not be needed for locally applied agents (e.g., dermal or 
ocular) where the pharmacology of the test substance is well characterized, and where systemic exposure or 
distribution to other organs or tissues is demonstrated to be low.

It appears that the metabolism of chlormethine is not fully known. It is possible that after topical application 
chlormethine is transformed into three of the most common chlormethine degradation products that are formed 
in aqueous solutions: the half mustard [N-methyl ß-chloroethyl) 2-hydroxyethylamine], the dimer 
N,N’-dimethyl-N,N’ bis(2-chloroethyl)piperazinium, and N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA). With the exception of 
the dimer, these transformations are likely to occur within minutes after contact with body constituents although 
the rate of transformation in skin is unknown.  As no signs of systemic exposure to chlormethine were observed 
in animals after topical application, no excretion of the test compound or its degradation products is expected. 
There are no anticipated systemic interactions involving chlormethine or its metabolites following topical 
administration of chlormethine gel, given the lack of detectable systemic exposure. 
The single dose toxicity of chlormethine has been adequately characterised in the published literature. Topical 
application of 0.01% – 2% chlormethine to animals, concentrations comparable to or up to 100-fold higher than 
in chlormethine gel, did not lead to systemic toxicity, suggesting absence of relevant systemic exposure to 
chlormethine. 
Chlormethine was genotoxic both in vitro and in vivo. The genotoxicity of chlormethine is well established, since 
its pharmacological mechanism of action is primarily due to DNA cross-linking. Chlormethine was shown to be 
genotoxic in bacterial, plant, and mammalian cells. Chlormethine was carcinogenic in rat and mouse 
carcinogenicity studies after subcutaneous and intravenous administration. 
Chlormethine was carcinogenic following dermal, i.v., s.c., and i.p. administration in mice and/or rats. Dermal 
application of chlormethine to mice at a dose of 15 mg/kg for up to 33 weeks resulted in skin tumours 
(squamous cell carcinomas and skin papilloma). There were no reports of systemic tumours after topical 
administration of chlormethine., which is consistent with no relevant systemic availability of chlormethine.  
Chlormethine adversely affected male fertility and was embryotoxic and teratogenic in mice and rats after 
systemic chlormethine administration. Intravenously administered chlormethine impaired male fertility in rats 
at a daily dose of ≥ 0.25 mg/kg for 2 weeks. No dedicated animal studies on the effects of chlormethine on 
female fertility have been reported in the literature. Chlormethine caused foetal malformations in mice and rats 
when given as single injections of 1–2.5 mg/kg. Other findings in animals included embryo-lethality and growth 
retardation when administered as a single injection. Chlormethine is not recommended during pregnancy and in 
women of child bearing potential not using contraception.   
There was no information on pharmacodynamic drug interaction, repeated-dose toxicity, toxicokinetic data, and 
in pre-and postnatal development presented. The systemic and local toxicities are well characterised and thus, 
the lack of studies is acceptable and no further non-clinical studies are considered necessary.  
The toxicity of DEGEE following topical administration was well characterized. DEGEE is neither genotoxic, 
carcinogenic nor teratogenic. 
The absence of systemic exposure after dermal application of chlormethine at relevant concentrations limits 
potential toxicity to local effects. Topical administration appeared to be well tolerated up to high doses. 
However, nitrogen mustards are vesicants causing skin, eye, and respiratory tract injury. Thus, dermal irritation 
and hypersensitivity reactions are expected (see clinical safety). No additional local toxicity studies for the gel 
formulation are considered necessary. 
Chlormethine hydrochloride is not a PBT substance as log Kow is much below 4.5 and hence, an assessment of 
chlormethine hydrochloride for persistence, bioaccumulation and toxicity was not considered necessary. The 
Phase I action limit of 0.01 μg/L is not exceeded for chlormethine hydrochloride from the use of chlormethine 
gel. In the worst-case, predicted surface water concentration for chlormethine hydrochloride is 435 times lower 
Assessment report

than this default threshold value (action limit). It is expected that the relative half-life of the active form of the 
compound is short in water and body fluids, chlormethine undergoes rapid chemical transformation and 
combines with water or reactive compounds in cells. Thus, chlormethine gel does not appear to represent a risk 
to the environment. However, chlormethine hydrochloride should be used according to the precautions stated in 
the SmPC section 6.6 (any unused medicinal product or waste material, including nitrile gloves used for 
application, must be disposed of in accordance with local requirements) in order to minimise any potential risks 
to the environment. 
Non-clinical information has been reflected in section 5.3 and relevant statements have been included in SmPC 
section 4.6. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical effects of chlormetine containing products have been well established in a comprehensive 
literature review. There is extensive and long term clinical experience with the test substance and no additional 
nonclinical studies are considered.  
Ledaga is not expected to pose a significant risk to the environment.  
Information has been adequately reflected in the SmPC sections 4.6, 5.3 and 6.6.

Absorption  
Study 201 (pivotal study) 
Study design 
Single-arm, 
open-label, 
extension study 
Study 201 was a multi-centre, randomised study comparing the efficacy, tolerability and safety of 0.02% 
chlormethine gel with AP in patients with MF. In a cohort of patients, blood samples were collected pre-dose at 
the baseline visit and 1, 3 and 6 hours after the first application of study treatment and at pre-dose the month 
1 visit (see methods section in 2.4.6.). Samples were analysed using HPLC method  
Results 
Plasma samples were collected from 23 patients (16 patients treated with chlormethine gel and 7 patients 
treated with AP, including patients who received whole body treatment. No measurable plasma concentrations 
of chlormethine were observed in any of the samples assayed. 
Study 202 (extension study) 
Study 202 was an open-label, single-arm study in patients who had completed study 201 but who had not 
achieved a complete response. Patients received up to 7 months of further treatment with a higher strength of 
chlormethine gel, 0.04%. Plasma samples were collected prior to treatment and 1 h after treatment at the 
baseline visit (or month 2 or 4 if the patient had already started the trial). A third sample per patient was also 
scheduled for collection prior to treatment and 1 h after application after 4 or 6 months’ exposure. Samples were 
analysed using LC/MS/MS method (see methods section in 2.4.6).  
Results 
Plasma samples were collected from 15 patients. For all 39 plasma samples assayed, the concentrations of 
chlormethine and half-mustard were below the LLOQ. Further, the chromatograms were examined, and there 
were no detectable peaks, based on lower limits of detection estimated to be 0.3 ng/mL for chlormethine and 1.0 
ng/mL for half-mustard. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The applicant did not submit pharmacodynamic studies (see pharmacology discussion).

2.4.4.  Discussion on the pharmacology aspects 
In clinical study 201 there was no evidence of systemic exposure following topical application of chlormethine 
gel. In study 202 there was also no evidence of systemic exposure following topical application of the higher 
strength gel, thus confirming the lack of systemic exposure at the recommended topical doses of chlormethine 
gel that has been seen in non-clinical studies. Patients who received chlormethine gel in Study 201 had no 
measurable concentrations of chlormethine in blood collected 1, 3 and 6 hours post-application on Day 1, and at 
the first month visit. Similarly, patients who received chlormethine gel 0.04% in a follow-up study (Study 202) 
had no measurable concentrations of chlormethine or its degradation product (half-mustard) in blood collected 
1 hour post-application on Day 1 or after 2, 4, or 6 months of treatment (See SmPC section 5.2.). Animal safety 
pharmacology data collected from publications (see discussion on non-clinical aspects) are considered 
supportive of the pharmacological effect of chlormethine in humans. In view of these findings and since there is 
extensive clinical safety experience with chlormethine gel and related formulations, no further pharmacological 
studies are required.  
2.4.5.  Conclusion on the pharmacology aspects 
The clinical pharmacology of chlormethine gel is considered to have been adequately evaluated from the data in 
the Studies 201 and 202. There was no evidence of systemic exposure following topical application of 
chlormethine gel. There was also no evidence of systemic exposure following topical application of the higher 
strength gel.  It has been demonstrated that there is no systemic exposure to chlormethine following local 
cutaneous administration of chlormethine gel. Therefore, the lack of dedicated PK and PD studies are 
acceptable.  
2.4.6.  Clinical efficacy 
Study 2005NMMF-201-US: Phase II pivotal trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of nitrogen 
mustard (NM) 0.02% ointment formulations in patients with stage I or IIA mycosis fungoides (MF) 
Methods 
Main inclusion criteria

Daily application of a thin topical film at approximately the same time each day, not 
to wash off for a minimum of 4 hours and not to cover the areas of application for 5-10 
minutes. Patients were treated in an outpatient setting.  
Patients with stage IA disease were generally instructed to treat all affected lesions. 
Full body application (excluded the area around the eyes and mucous membranes) 
was generally prescribed if the subject had either (1) stage IB or IIA MF or (2) 
severity of new lesions developing after treatment initiation met the criteria for 
progressive disease (≥25% worsening). The final decision to treat specific lesions or 
whole body was at the discretion of the investigator. 
Treatment Adjustments for Toxicity: Frequency of application was adjusted for 
toxicity. The frequency of application could be reduced or temporarily suspended, 
then re-introduced with a reduced frequency, in case of Grade 3 - 4 skin toxicity/local 
dermal irritation. Topical steroids (up to 1%) were permitted only for non-MF lesions. 
Once daily for up to 12 months, unless disease progression, treatment-limiting 
toxicity, concomitant illness, or any change in health status necessitated 
discontinuation of study therapy 
Grade 3 or 4 local dermal irritation that did not improve to Grade 2 or lower within 2

Usage 
Follow up 
Patients were reminded to return all empty containers and any unused study drug at 
their next scheduled visit. The total usage was estimated by calculating the total 
number of returned used tubes/ total days on study drug. 
Patients were followed off study for an additional 12 months to assess the potential 
for the development of cutaneous tumours, in particular squamous cell carcinomas. 
If patients suffered toxicity, the frequency of application was adjusted according to the protocol-defined 
guidelines Table 3.

Objectives 
The primary objective: To evaluate the efficacy of topical application of nitrogen mustard (NM) 0.02% in a 
propylene glycol ointment (PG) vs. NM 0.02% in an Aquaphor ointment (AP) in subjects 
with stage I or IIA mycosis fungoides (MF). 
The secondary objective: To evaluate the tolerability and safety of topical application of NM 0.02% ointment 
formulations in patients with stage IA, IB or IIA MF. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was response rate defined as response rate (complete + partial) using the 
Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity (CAILS) score. The CAILS requires scoring of up to five index 
lesions (lesions selected for assessment of efficacy) for scaling (0–8), erythema (0–8), plaque elevation (0–3), 
and surface area (0–18). The sum of the scores for each of these categories and each of the five index lesions 
represents the total CAILS score. 70

The CAILS score utilised in Studies 201 and 202 differed slightly from previously published versions. The 
assessment of hypo/hyperpigmentation was eliminated from the scale as well as the assessment of plaque 
elevation was simplified into a more compressed scale because the available data did not support the ability to 
clinically differentiate smaller gradations. There was also the substitution of the percent BSA value for index 
lesions rather than a 0-18 categorical scale.  A comparison of these CAILS scores is shown in Table 5.

Response rate defined as ≥50% improvement in the SWAT which was derived by measuring each 
involved area as a percentage of total body surface area (%BSA) and multiplying it by a 
severity-weighting factor (1=patch, 2=plaque, 3=tumour).Response was defined as ≥50% 
improvement in the baseline SWAT score on two or more consecutive observations over at least 4 
weeks.

Time to first confirmed CAILS response defined as time to first confirmed response for a given patient, 
defined as the time interval from the first day study drug was dispensed to the time of the first confirmed 
response. This is the date of the evaluation at least 28 days after the first assessment of complete or 
partial response which shows that the response was sustained for at least that period of time with no 
intervening assessments indicating otherwise.  
•  Duration of response (CAILS score) defined as time from the first appearance of the response to the first 
assessment where the response is no longer apparent.  
• 
Time to disease progression defined as time from first day study medication was applied to the date the 
first disease progression occurred (≥ 25% increase from baseline CAILS score) 
•  Safety: All patients who received at least one dose of study medication. AEs, physical examination, and 
clinical laboratory data  
• 
PK: Plasma samples were collected to determine/ detect any levels of chlormethine. 
Sample size 
The required sample size to demonstrate non-inferiority was estimated to be 250 patients. This was based on 
assumptions that the response rate in the AP comparator arm would be approximately 68% for patients who 
completed at least 6 months of therapy (Efficacy Evaluable population; no major protocol violations). It was 
considered that approximately 25% of patients would not complete 6 months of therapy e.g. due to dermatitis, 
concomitant illnesses. 
Randomisation 
The Master List of Randomisation Numbers with the corresponding study drug assignments were sent to the site 
pharmacist. It was the responsibility of the site pharmacist to order and provide the correct study drug using the 
Assessment report

master list. Eligible patients were stratified into two groups by MF stage (IA vs. IB, IIA). 
Blinding (masking) 
The study site personnel not involved with patient assessment were not blinded. Investigators and any other 
individuals involved with patient assessments were blinded to the assigned treatment.   
Statistical methods 
This trial is designed as a non-inferiority study comparing the PG formulation of NM, 0.02% to the AP 
formulation of NM, 0.02% in the treatment of Stage I and IIA mycosis fungoides.  The two treatment arms were 
compared with respect to the response rate defined as ≥50% improvement in baseline Composite Assessment 
of Index Lesion Severity (CAILS) score during the 12 month study, confirmed at the next visit that is at least four 
weeks later (primary endpoint). Non-inferiority was assessed based on the 95% confidence interval around the 
ratio of the response rate of the patients treated with the PG formulation to the response rate of the patients 
treated with the AP formulation using the likelihood ratio methods of Miettinen and Nurminen. The PG 
formulation will be determined to be non-inferior to the AP formulation if the lower limit of the 95% confidence 
interval is ≥0.75. Based on the response of a placebo controlled trial72, where placebo response rate was 24% 
(95%CI:12.6%, 38.8%),  the estimated effect size of 68% for chlormethine exceeds the placebo effect of 24% 
and its upper limit of the 95%CI (51%).  All statistical tests of primary endpoint were 2-sided with significance 
level of 0.05. No interim analysis was planned or conducted.  Time to event parameters were estimated using 
Kaplan-Meier (KM) methodology and treatment arms compared using a log-rank statistic.  
As secondary measures of efficacy, the response rates, defined as ≥50% improvement from baseline score 
confirmed at the next visit that is at least 4 weeks later, was compared between the two treatment arms based 
on the SWAT and the percent of total body surface area affected (%BSA). Additional secondary endpoints in the 
SAP were time to first confirmed response, duration of first confirmed response, and the time to initial disease 
progression based on the CAILS score. To control the Type I error, differences in secondary endpoints were 
tested at the 0.01 level. 
The response categories for CAILS and SWAT in the clinical studies are shown in Table 6. All responses were 
assessed at the patient level and were to be confirmed at least 4 weeks after the first assessment (confirmed 
response).

The study duration was 4 years. The date of first patient enrolment: May 2006 and date of last completed: July 
2010. 
Conduct of the study 
There were two significant changes to the supply of chlormethine gel during the study:  
• 
• 
Instruction to patients to store the gel in the refrigerator rather than at room temperature, once dispensed 
(made after approximately one third of patients had completed the study) 
Introduction of gel produced on a commercial scale at the intended commercial facility. 
There were also a number of protocol amendments, including: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Follow-up period was extended to 12 months to capture the occurrence of skin cancer  
The sample size was increased from 90-110 patients to 240-250 patients in recognition that the response 
rates in the Efficacy Evaluable population using the CAILS score would be expected to be closer to 70% than 
84%. To achieve this sample size, the number of clinical sites was increased to 13.  
The requirement for mid- and post-treatment skin biopsies was eliminated. In recognition of this the FDA 
requested that the designation of complete (pathologic) response be deleted from the protocol. 
There had to be concordance on the diagnosis of early MF between the local and coordinating 
dermatopathologist (Fox Chase Cancer Center) 
Prior topical nitrogen mustard was permitted if at least 2 years had elapsed 
The language in the protocol was clarified for: 
o  No other treatments for MF were permitted 
o  Prior BCNU was not permitted 
The SAP was revised to control for the Type I error rate for secondary endpoints as well as incorporate 
changes based on other protocol amendments.

The majority of exclusions in the EE data set (75 patients) were due to the protocol deviations at the one study 
site (18 patients) and skin toxicity (39 patients). 
The major protocol deviations that occurred were related to randomisation. 
Randomisation 
The pharmacist at the site #7 assigned treatments assigned to patients based on their MF Stage and not on the 
master list. A total of 18 patients were recruited at this site (6.9% of patients enrolled). When it was discovered, 
this protocol violation was reviewed with the investigator, who was unblinded. At this time, 6 patients were still 
on treatment. Failure to randomise patients in accordance with the protocol was considered to be a major 
protocol violation. Sensitivity analyses have been introduced to evaluate the impact of this issue. 
Concomitant therapy 
The records of all patients who had corticosteroids listed as a concomitant medicine while receiving study 
therapy were reviewed. The review showed that no patient met the criterion for a major protocol violation. One 
AP arm patient was treated with UVB 3 days prior to the last visit, but 2 weeks after the last application of topical 
chlormethine gel and subsequently withdrew from the study prior to month 2 due to TLT and wasn’t excluded 
from the EE data set.

Outcomes and estimation 
The primary endpoint efficacy analyses were conducted on the Intent-to-Treat (ITT), the Efficacy Evaluable (EE) 
populations (patients with no major protocol violations who were on study for at least 6 months) and an analysis 
for the ITT excluding mis-randomised subjects from the site #7. The results are presented in Table 12.

Efficacy results - Secondary endpoints 
Confirmed SWAT response rate 
Confirmed SWAT response rate was a key secondary efficacy endpoint.  Response was defined as ≥50% 
improvement in the baseline SWAT score on two or more consecutive observations over at least 4 weeks.

Duration of response based on CAILS score 
For patients who achieved a confirmed CAILS response, the duration of response was defined as the time from 
the first appearance of the confirmed response to the first assessment where the response was no longer 
apparent (i.e., the CAILS score showed < 50% improvement from baseline).

Time to progression based on CAILS Score 
Time to disease progression was defined as time to the first ≥ 25% increase from baseline CAILS score. 15 
patients randomised to chlormethine gel arm and 10 patients randomised to the AP arm had a ≥ 25% increase 
from baseline CAILS score at some time during the study (protocol-defined disease progression). However, the

majority of patients remained on treatment and 7 of the patients on the gel arm who stayed on treatment 
achieved a confirmed response.

Ancillary analyses 
Across the different subgroups, the response ratio (chlormethine gel/ AP) was near 1 or exceeded 1 (favouring 
chlormethine gel), (see Table  below) consistent with the overall study results. In addition, in all subgroups, the 
95% CIs for response ratio overlapped those observed in the overall population.

Supportive study 
Study 2007NMMF-202-US (Study 202) 
Study design 
Study 202 was an open-label, multi-center, 7-month extension of Study 201 to evaluate the safety and efficacy 
of higher dosage strengths of Ledaga, i.e. chlormethine gel 0.04% in patients who had completed up to 12 
months of treatment with chlormethine gel or AP without achieving a complete response. Patients who entered 
Study 202 were followed and evaluated for adverse events and skin cancers during the 7-month study treatment 
period and for 5 months thereafter (or the remainder of the 12-month safety follow-up period of Study 201, if 
treatment was discontinued prematurely). 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with a response (≥ 50% reduction in the baseline 
CAILS score of Study 202), confirmed by two or more consecutive observations over at least 4 weeks. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints were ≥ 50% improvement from baseline in the SWAT score, %BSA change from 
baseline and time to CAILS response by KM.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/653881/2017 
Page 48/76 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All analyses were conducted using the Safety analysis set (N = 98), which included all patients who received at 
least one application of chlormethine gel 0.04%. 
Table 19: 
Patient disposition - Study 202 (Safety analysis set) 
Primary endpoint 
CAILS responses for “Prior Index Lesions” (i.e., index lesions that were used to assess efficacy in Study 201) 
were assessed both relative to the baseline scores of Study 201 and relative to the baseline scores of Study 202. 
CAILS responses at the end of Study 202, relative to Study 201 baseline, showed that 12.2% of patients had a 
complete response and 63.3% had a partial response, resulting in a confirmed overall response rate of 75.5%.

Table 20: 
CAILS responses from baseline of study 201 for prior index lesions – Study 202 
CAILS responses relative to the Study 202 baseline showed that 10.2% of patients had a complete response and 
13.3% had a partial response, resulting in a confirmed response rate of 23.5%. CAILS responses for “All Index 
Lesions” (i.e., Prior Index Lesions still present at baseline of Study 202 and new lesions that were identified as 
index lesions upon entry into Study 202 but were already present at baseline of Study 201) were assessed by 
comparison with the Study 202 baseline score only. The confirmed overall response rate was 26.5%, with 6.1% 
of patients showing a complete response and 20.4% showing a partial response.

Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Nitrogen mustard has been part of the treatment of MF-type CTCL for more than a half century. Thus, the 
clinically acceptable dose of nitrogen mustard is well-known and has been well-characterised. The treatment of 
lesions was for the duration of the trial (maximum of 12 months), unless patients suffered treatment-limiting 
toxicities, which would require permanent discontinuation. If toxicity occurred, patients were required to adjust 
the frequency of application according to the protocol-defined guidelines (SmPC section 4.2). It has been 
reported in the literature that maintenance therapy has been variously continued for months, 1-2 years or

longer73. Patients with early MF-type CTLC stage IA, IB or IIA disease require management of the disease by 
application of skin-directed therapies and subsequent monitoring once the lesions have resolved. The EORTC 
consensus recommendations for the treatment of mycois fungoides/Sezary syndrome recommends that topical 
chlormethine therapy is continued for 6 months after clearance of skin lesions.74 Therefore, it is expected that 
patients will be treated for as long as benefit is derived from the treatment of the skin lesions. 
In addition, the application is includes two studies (study 201 andstudy 202). Study 201 is a multi-centre, 
randomised and observer-blinded study to support the efficacy and safety of this new pharmaceutical form. The 
study randomised 260 patients to the two treatment arms. Included patients have stage I or IIA MF-type CTCL, 
who have been treated with at least one skin-directed therapy (excl. nitrogen mustard and carmustine, which is 
a mustard gas-related nitrosourea compound). Both the inclusion and exclusion criteria are acceptable.  
The treatment of chlormethine in the proposed indication is fully acceptable from a clinical point of view as the 
trial is comparing different pharmaceutical forms for an indication that has been previously approved for the 
active substance. Current first-line standard of care of MF-type CTCL stage I and IIA is skin-directed therapies, 
such as topical steroids, psoralens + PUVA, UVB and topical cystostatic agents (mechlorethamine or 
carmustine). The chlormethine control group used in the pivotal study is acceptable to establish efficacy and 
safety of Ledaga, and the activity observed for the control group was in the range of what has been reported for 
chlormethine formulations in clinical trials. 
The principal objective of study 201 was to evaluate the efficacy of topical application of nitrogen mustard (NM) 
0.02% in a propylene glycol ointment (PG) vs. NM 0.02% in an Aquaphor ointment (AP) in subjects with stage 
I or IIA mycosis fungoides (MF). The primary endpoint (CAILS) and several secondary endpoints (SWAT, %BSA, 
time to first comfirmed response, duration of response and time to progression) were considered acceptable. 
The primary endpoint is well-known and has previously been used as one of two co-primary endpoints in the 
approval of Targretin by the CHMP in 2001. The CAILS score utilised in Studies 201 and 202 differed slightly 
from previously published versions (see methods section). SWAT is fully acceptable as a secondary endpoint and 
supports the primary endpoint in the interpretation of data, as it involves direct assessment of the body surface 
area of each MF-type CTCL lesion. The study was designed as a non-inferiority study which is considered to be 
acceptable for this hybrid application. The protocol-defined criteria for non-inferiority was the lower limit of the 
95% confidence interval for the ratio of the overall response rate for chlormethine Gel / AP ≥ 0.75. The chosen 
non-inferiority margin of 0.75 was selected to ensure that the efficacy of chlormethine gel would be greater than 
the historical placebo response rate. Based on the results of Study 201 the conclusion of the non-inferiority 
would have been reached with more conservative margins.   
With regard to the conduct of the study, seven major amendments were made to the protocol during the study, 
and they are all considered reasonable and thus endorsed. There were no major concerns raised on the conduct 
of the study or major non-compliance issues revealed during the assessment of the dossier. There was a breach 
of randomisation at site #7. The applicant has taken account of the breach at the site #7 site in the analyses sets 
of the primary and secondary endpoints and it was concluded that there is no statistical difference between the 
data with or without the site and the results are consistent with the outcome of the primary endpoint. Study 201 
appears to be a well-conducted study with an acceptable study design to support the demonstration of 
non-inferior clinical efficacy relative to the AP formulation in the selected MF patients population.

The baseline characteristics are well balanced, however, there are slightly more patients with stage IA disease 
in the chlormethine gel group, however, it is not considered to have a major impact on the results. Very few 
patients were stage IIA (only two in each arm). Most patients are 18-64 years, have stage IA or IB disease, with 
prior therapy consisting of corticosteroids, phototherapy or Targretin.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The efficacy data derived from Study 201 demonstrate that the gel formulation is non-inferior to the 
comparatorfor both ITT and EE populations for the primary endpoint CAILS response and for the important 
secondary endpoint, SWAT. For the EE analysis set, the overall response rates were 76.7% for chlormethine gel 
and 58.9% for AP comparator (ratio 1.301; 95% CI: 1.065–1.609). The SWAT results demonstrated an overall 
response rate of 63.3% for gel vs 55.8% for the AP in the EE analysis set (ratio 1.135; 95% CI: 0.893–
1.448). There are slightly more patients with stage IA in the chlormethine gel arm, which appear to fair better 
than those with more advanced disease. Time to first confirmed response based on CAILS scores (a secondary 
endpoint), also showed a statistically significant difference in favour of chlormethine gel. The difference is only 
borderline significant in the EE analysis, while non-significant in the ITT analyses. The expected response rate 
for the AP formulation is within the range of responses observed in other studies with other compounded 
presentations of chlormethine. Therefore, the differences observed between Ledaga and the AP comparator are 
not considered clinically relevant and comparable equivalence can be considered demonstrated.   
Additional supportive evidence is shown in study 202. Increasing the dose and extending the treatment period 
seems to increase the chances for complete or partial response, when compared to baseline index lesions at 
study start in study 201. However, the chances for partial responses diminish substantially, when compared to 
index lesion at study start in study 202. This study is considered to be supportive only- as the strength is higher 
than the proposed marketed product.  
The indication ‘ topical treatment of mycosis fungoides-type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (MF type CTCL) in adult 
patients’ is broader than the inclusion criteria of study 201 (early stage I or IIA disease and previously treated 
with at least one skin-directed therapy). Although the claimed indication represents a broader population of 
patients than the inclusion criteria of the pivotal study, no relevant differences in efficacy and safety are 
expected. Safety and efficacy of Ledaga are considered established for treatment of patients at any stage of the 
disease. 
Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The formulation of chlormethine (AP) used in the pivotal trial is considered to be comparable in terms of efficacy 
to the reference product, based on the known pharmacokinetics of the products and given that the two products 
have the same active substance, strength, route of administration and indication, and based on indirect 
comparison of the efficacy and safety profiles. 
Based on the non-inferiority in efficacy of Ledaga compared to the formulation of chlormethine used in the 
pivotal trial, the CHMP considered that the results of appropriate clinical trials have been submitted to 
demonstrate efficacy of Ledaga. These results are supported by the secondary endpoints as well as the results 
from the extension study 202. No additional toxicological, pharmacological or clinical tests were considered 
necessary to establish the efficacy of Ledaga.

2.4.7.  Clinical safety 
Safety data are derived from studies 2005NMMF-201-US and 2005NMMF-202-US. 255 patients were enrolled in 
study 2005NMMF-201-US, 128 on the chlormethine gel and 127 on AP formulation. Approximately 65% of 
patients received study treatment for > 48 weeks. The median duration of treatment for the gel was 51.7 weeks 
and 52.0 weeks for the AP. Safety information is also provided from the published literature, based on the known 
safety profile of the reference product and post-marketing experience in the US. Safety topics of special interest 
were identified as non-melanoma skin cancer, hypersensitivity and adverse events that could indicate systemic 
effects of topical administration of chlormethine. 
Patient exposure 
Patient exposure includes:  
•  255 patients in study 201, (128 on chlormethine gel, 127 on AP) 
•  98 patients in study 202, 90.8% patients received more than 24 weeks of treatment 
•  Chlormethine gel has been approved in the US under the brand name Valchlor. 4 quarterly Periodic 
Adverse Drug Experience Reports have been submitted to the FDA (23 August 2013 to 22 August 2014 
- total of 784 patients)

Adverse events 
In study 201, 84.4% of patients treated with chlormethine gel and 90.6% of patients treated with AP 
experienced at least one AE. AEs that were considered to be possibly, probably, or definitely related to study 
drug were reported by 62% of the patients on the gel arm and 50% of patients on the AP arm. In both treatment 
arms, the majority of AEs were associated with the skin, with the most frequently reported AEs: 
•  Dermatitis (54.7% on chlormethine gel, 57.5% on AP) 
• 
Pruritus (20.3% on chlormethine gel, 16.5% on AP) 
•  Skin infections (11.7% on chlormethine gel, 11.0% on AP)

Adverse events of special interest 
Skin cancers 
Given the known mechanism of action of chlormethine, and specifically the alkylation of DNA, attention has been 
placed on whether treatment with topical chlormethine increases the risk for other forms of skin cancer, 
especially squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas. Vonderheid, in his review of the records of 331 patients, 
reported an estimated relative risk of 7.8 for squamous cell carcinoma and a risk of 1.8 for basal cell 
carcinoma 75. Vonderheid included patients in his analysis who received concurrent skin-damaging or 
immunosuppressive therapies and did not evaluate a chlormethine monotherapy group separately for risk of 
secondary cancer development. Exposure to ultraviolet light or radiation therapy can increase risk of developing

skin cancer. In the Stanford series76  where topical chlormethine was applied as monotherapy, non-melanoma 
skin cancers occurred in 8 of 203 patients; however, 6 of these 8 patients had received subsequent therapies 
such as psoralen UVA (PUVA) or total skin electron beam therapy prior to secondary skin cancer detection. In the 
2 patients who developed skin cancer with chlormethine monotherapy, the skin cancer occurred in sites of 
actinic damage (face) that were not exposed to chlormethine application. The author concluded that the 
potential for secondary skin cancer development is increased in patients who have used multiple sequential 
topical skin-damaging therapies and chlormethine, but not in patients who have used chlormethine as 
monotherapy76 . Similar findings were reported in an earlier publication77 . 
Secondary non-melanoma skin cancers have been reported in the 76literature as a potential toxicity associated 
with chlormethine and other skin-directed therapies such as PUVA and electron beam radiation.  10 patients (3 
on the gel; 7 on the AP arm) developed non-melanoma skin cancers during the study or during the 12 month 
follow-up period. The majority of skin cancers occurred in untreated areas.  
•  Squamous cell carcinoma: 5 patients (updated) 
o  2 on the gel arm (1 in an untreated area) and 3 on the AP arm (2 in an untreated area) 
o  1 AP patient, there was no MF lesion on the dorsal hand, but it could not be confirmed that the 
drug did not get on the dorsal hand during application 
o  1 PG patient developed a SCC in a treated area on her right upper back during the follow-up 
period (previous history of BCC, SCC, breast cancer and prior MF therapies included UVB and 
targretin)

Hypersensitivity 
Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with topical chlormethine. Cutaneous hypersensitivity was 
reported for 3 patients (2.3%) in the chlormethine gel arm and 2 patients (1.6%) in the AP arm in Study 201. 
All cases were considered related or possibly related to study drug and triggered treatment discontinuation.

Deaths 
Study 201: 
There was one death reported during the study, and none during the 12-month follow-up period. One patient 
was diagnosed with widely disseminated metastatic cancer less than 2 months after the initiation of treatment 
with chlormethine gel and died on Day 84 of the study.

The MRI revealed widely disseminated carcinoma (biopsy results favoured colon primary). The disseminated 
metastatic cancer could have been present at baseline and thus, was deemed not related to study treatment.  
Study 202:  
There were no deaths during the study or within 30 days of stopping study treatment. One patient died due to 
metastatic lung cancer 6 months after premature discontinuation of study treatment due to lung cancer. The 
metastatic lung cancer was considered by the investigator as unrelated to study treatment. 
Laboratory findings 
There are no reports of laboratory abnormalities associated with topical chlormethine use in the published 
literature.  Clinical laboratory safety data were monitored throughout the two studies and no trend toward 
abnormal values were noted.  
Safety in special populations 
Elderly patients 
In Study 201, 79 patients (31%) were  ≥ 65 years of age. There was a higher frequency of AEs in elderly patients 
and higher proportions of elderly patients discontinued due to an AE. However, overall, drug related safety 
observations in the ≥ 65 years of age are consistent with the whole population.

The applicant did not submit data on use in pregnancy and lactation. Study protocols for studies 201 and 202 
excluded pregnant or nursing women, and all men and women of childbearing potential had to agree to use an 
effective method of contraception. However, the female partner of one of the male patients became pregnant 
approximately 1–2 months after the initiation of treatment with AP. It was reported that the outcome of the 
pregnancy was a healthy, full-term infant. No other reports of pregnancy in patients treated with topical 
chlormethine were identified in the published literature. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The applicant did not submit studies on drug-drug interactions. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment in study 201  
AEs leading to discontinuation of chlormethine are well described in the published literature. More dose 
modifications triggered by TLTs (reduced frequency/ temporary suspensions) occurred in patients who received 
the gel formulation. A similar number of patients discontinued study treatment due to an AE in both treatment 
groups. The most frequently reported AEs were associated with skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders.

Limiting Toxicity 
AEs leading to discontinuation of study treatment in Study 202  
The most frequent reason for early withdrawal from the study was lack of efficacy, which was reported for 3 
(3.1%) patients. Two (2.0%) patients each withdrew for TLT and other AEs. Of the 98 patients who were treated 
in Study 202, 40 had previously received treatment with chlormethine gel, and 58 had previously received 
treatment with the AP formulation in Study 201. Most premature withdrawals from the study in Study 202 
(10/13) were for patients who had previously received the AP formulation in Study 201. 
Five (5.1%) patients prematurely discontinued study treatment due to AEs: 2 patients who had previously 
received chlormethine gel and 3 patients who had previously received AP. Of these, 4 patients discontinued due 
to AEs of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (one patient who had previously received chlormethine gel and 
3 patients who had previously received AP), and one patient discontinued due to SAEs (hip fracture and 
metastatic lung cancer). 
Assessment report

Of the 4 patients who withdrew due to skin-related AEs, 2 patients experienced treatment-limiting skin toxicity 
requiring discontinuation from the study, as defined in the protocol, and 2 patients were discontinued due to skin 
AEs: one due to pruritus and one due to erythema.

AEs leading to dose modification 
Few patients required dosing modifications: 8 (8.2%) patients required a temporary reduction in dosing 
frequency, and 5 (5.1%) patients required a temporary suspension of dosing. Dose modifications were triggered 
by TLTs. 
2.4.8.  Post marketing experience 
The published experience demonstrates that the vast majority of AEs observed are related to skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders. Chlormethine 0.02% gel was approved as Valchlor in the US in August 2013. 4 
quarterly Periodic Adverse Drug Experience Reports for Valchlor have been submitted to the FDA, covering the 
review period from 23 August 2013 to 22 August 2014. A total of 784 patients have been treated with Valchlor 
since approval to the 22 August 2014, and 243 reports were received including 241 cases from 222 treated 
patients. The remaining 2 cases were reports from care givers who experienced adverse reactions through 
secondary exposure (one who experienced itching after smelling the medication whilst applying the gel to the 
patient and the other who noticed a neck rash in the morning after her partner applied the chlormethine gel at 
bedtime, the night before). 
The most commonly reported AEs were:

•  Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (266 events, 45.5%) 
o  Pruritus (49, 8.4%) 
o  Erythema (37, 6.3%) 
o  Rash (20, 3.4%) 
o  Blister (18, 3.1%) 
o  Skin irritation (17, 2.9%) 
o  Burning sensation (13, 2.2%) 
•  General disorders and administration site conditions (119 events, 20.3%) 
• 
Injury, poisoning and procedural complications (56 events, 9.6%) 
2.4.9.  Discussion on clinical safety aspects 
The safety evaluation is based on two sponsored studies (Study 2005NMMF-201-US (Study 201) and Study 
2007NMMF-202-US (Study 202)) and post-marketing data reported for Valchlor (mechlorethamine) which is 
marketed in the US. 
The safety database included 255 patients; approximately 65% of patients were treated for more than 48 weeks 
in both treatment arms.  Overall, the mean duration of exposure is 39.3 weeks in the chlormethine gel arm 
compared to 41.5 weeks in the AP arm. The median exposure time is 51.7 weeks vs. 51.9 weeks in chlormethine 
gel arm and AP arm, respectively. Taking into consideration the known safety and tolerability of the active 
substance, the safety database provides an acceptable number of exposed patients as well as exposure time to 
the product.  
Given the lack of evidence for systemic exposure to chlormethine after topical use, non-skin related AEs such as 
nausea, sinusitis, back pain, dyspnoea and pneumonia were not considered to be ADRs. The following reactions 
have been assessed as ADRs and have been included in section 4.8 of the Ledaga SmPC: dermatitis, pruritus, 
skin infections, skin ulceration and blistering, skin hyperpigmentation and hypersensitivity.  
The most common AEs are within the SOC “Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders”. Dermatitis is the most 
commonly observed AE and was reported for 70 (54.7%) patients in the chlormethine gel arm vs. 73 in the AP 
arm (57.5%), with a higher incidence of moderate-moderately severe intensity in the chlormethine gel arm. The 
second most common AE is pruritus 20.3% vs. 16.5% in chlormethine gel arm and AP arm, respectively. These 
AEs are all well-known and manageable in the clinical setting. Hypersensitivity was observed in 2% (5 patients, 
3 with chlormethine and 2 with AP) of patients in the study 201. Thus, local skin reactions and hypersensitivity 
have been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC and in the RMP as important identified risks. In addition, based 
on the non-clinical toxicity data and the causality of the skin-related-ADRs and severity of the AEs, contact with 
mucous membranes, especially those of the eyes, must be avoided. Exposure of mucous membranes such as 
the oral mucosa or nasal mucosa causes pain, redness, and ulceration, and these may be severe. Exposure of 
the eyes to chlormethine causes pain, burns, inflammation, photophobia, and blurred vision. Blindness and 
severe irreversible anterior eye injury may occur (section 4.4 of the SmPC). Toxicity to mucous 
membranes/eyes has been included as an important identified risk. 
Five (3.9%) patients experienced 9 Grade 4 AEs in the chlormethine gel arm vs. 9 (7.1%) patients with 10 Grade 
4 AEs in the AP arm. Most of the Grade 4 AEs were observed in the SOC “Skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders”. Three malignant neoplasms (1 basal cell carcinoma, 1 squamous cell carcinoma, and 1 basal cell and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/653881/2017 
Page 71/76 
  
  
squamous cell carcinoma) were observed in the chlormethine gel arm compared to 7 in the AP arm (3 basal cell 
carcinoma, 2 squamous cell carcinoma, 1 merkel cell carcinoma and 1 basal cell/squamous cell carcinoma). 
However, none of the AEs were judged related to chlormethine treatment.  Development of secondary skin 
cancers is a known risk of skin targeted therapies in the treatment MF-type CTCL. Thus, patients treated with 
topical chlormethine should be monitored for skin cancers, as described in section 4.4 of the proposed SmPC and 
skin cancers is included in the RMP as important potential risks. The ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC are 
consistent with the approved SmPC of Caryolysine (chlormethine). 
As chlormethine is to be applied at home by the patient or the caregiver, there is the risk to secondary exposure 
to someone other than the patient, a risk which has been included in the RMP as an important potential risk. The 
PRAC and CHMP considered that given the risk of secondary exposure as well the severity of the toxicity to 
mucous membranes, educational material in the form of a patient and caregiver card (included in each box of 
Ledaga) was necessary in order to educate patients on all steps to be followed when applying Ledaga, to inform 
patients what to do in case of secondary exposure and to inform patients on the use of the transparent sealable 
plastic bag. 
In general, there are comparable number of AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation in the two treatment 
arms, with only small percentage differences, however it must be noted that the numbers are small. 
There are more dose modifications in the chlormethine gel, mainly due to skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders. The guidance on dose modification in section 4.2 of the SmPC is considered adequate. 
No laboratory abnormalities have been noted. This is consistent with the observation that there is no 
documented systemic exposure following topical administration of chlormethine gel. 
There are limited data on the use of chlormethine in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity after systemic administration (see section 5.3 of the SmPC and non-clinical discussion). 
Ledaga is not recommended during pregnancy (section 4.6 of the SmPC). It is unknown whether chlormethine 
is excreted in human milk. A risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded due to the potential for topical or 
systemic exposure of the suckling infant to chlormethine through contact with the mother’s skin. A decision 
must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue Ledaga therapy, taking into account the 
benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the breast feeding mother (section 4.6 of the 
SmPC). The use of Ledaga during pregnancy and lactation has been added as an important potential risk. 
The safety and efficacy of Ledaga in children aged 0 to 18 years have not been established. No data are available 
(section 4.2 of the SmPC). Therefore, the use of chlormethine in paediatric patients has been included as 
missing information. 
2.4.10.  Conclusions on clinical safety aspects 
The safety of Ledaga has been adequately characterised. The ADRs observed in the clinical trials are broadly 
consistent with those in the SmPC for the reference medicinal product, Caryolysine and the published literature. 
Post-marketing events reported to date have not identified any new risks or signals and no regulatory actions 
have been taken for safety reasons.

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This application concerns a hybrid version of chlormethine for a new pharmaceutical form (gel for cutaneous 
use) with reference to Caryolysine (a solution for injection and cutaneous use). The indication for the product 
Ledaga is for the topical treatment of mycosis fungoides-type cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (MF type CTCL) in 
adult patients the same as for the reference medicinal product Caryolysine. Typical bioequivalence studies in 
plasma cannot be conducted for topical products that are not absorbed, and in any case plasma would not be a 
relevant compartment. This is consistent with the guidance from the guideline on the investigation of 
bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **). A review of the published literature was provided 
for this application and considered sufficient to cover the non-clinical aspects as well as to support the clinical 
aspects (efficacy and safety). In addition, this application relies also on the results from a clinical trial and a 
follow up study comparing the commercial formulation chlormethine gel against an adequate chlormethine 
comparator were submitted to provide further pharmacological data (pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics) as well as confirm the efficacy and safety data of the product. These data demonstrate the 
efficacy and safety chlormethine gel, and based on indirect comparison, the efficacy and safety of the gel 
formulation are in line with what has been observed with the reference medicinal product in term of all important 
clinical endpoints.  
The safety and tolerability of topical chlormethine are well known and no new concerns have been raised from 
the reported AEs in the safety database from the studies 201 and 202. The ADRs observed are considered well 
tolerated and manageable following the recommendations in the SmPC, routine PhV and implementation of 
additional risk minimisation activities. The PRAC and CHMP considered that educational material for patients and 
caregivers was necessary to ensure the safe use of the product.  
Taking into account the overall evidence in terms of efficacy and safety, the data are considered robust and

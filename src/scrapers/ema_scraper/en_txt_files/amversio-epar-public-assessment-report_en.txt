2.1.  Introduction 
This centralised application for a marketing authorisation concerns a generic application according to article 
10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC for Amversio (betaine anhydrous), 1 g, oral powder. Application has been initially 
submitted by the Applicant Veriton Pharma Limited, UK.  
Subsequently,  the  Applicant  has  been  changed  to.  Serb,  Brussels,  Belgium  in  order  to  fulfil  EU  legal 
requirements. 
Assessment report  
EMA/203554/2022 
Page 8/19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  reference  medicinal  product  is  Cystadane  1  g  oral  powder  (MAA  No:  EU/1/06/379/001,  Recordati  Rare 
Diseases,  France).  On  9  July  2001,  orphan  designation  (EU/3/01/045)  was  granted  by  the  European 
Commission  to  Orphan  Europe,  France,  for  betaine  anhydrous  for  the  treatment  of  homocystinuria.  Betaine 
anhydrous  has  been  authorised  in  the  EU  as  Cystadane  since  15  February  2007.  Cystadane  was  withdrawn 
from the Community Register of designated orphan medicinal products in February 2017 at the end of the 10-
years  period  of  market  exclusivity.  Amversio  has  the  same  therapeutic  indications  as  Cystadane,  same 
qualitative and quantitative composition, same pharmaceutical form, strength and route of administration. This 
formulation is without any excipients. 
No  bioequivalence  study  between  Amversio  and  the  reference  medicinal  product  Cystadane  has  been 
performed. As Amversio contains betaine only, with no excipients, and as betaine is also freely soluble in water, 
the ‘oral solutions’ section of Appendix II of the BE guideline (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr**) applies. 
Proposed indication 
Amversio is indicated as adjunctive treatment of homocystinuria, involving deficiencies or defects in:  
- 
cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS),  
-  5,10 methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR),  
- 
cobalamin cofactor metabolism (cbl).  
Amversio should be used as supplement to other therapies such as vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), vitamin B12 
(cobalamin), folate and a specific diet. 
Posology 
Amversio treatment should be supervised by a physician experienced in the treatment of patients with 
homocystinuria. 
Children and adults  
The recommended total daily dose is 100 mg/kg/day given in 2 doses daily. However, the dose should be 
individually titrated according to plasma levels of homocysteine and methionine. In some patients doses 
above 200 mg/ kg/day were needed to reach therapeutic goals. Caution should be exercised with up titrating 
doses for patients with CBS deficiency due to the risk for hypermethioninaemia. Methionine levels should be 
closely monitored in these patients.  
Special populations  
Hepatic or renal impairment  
Experience with betaine anhydrous therapy in patients with renal insufficiency or non-alcoholic hepatic 
steatosis has demonstrated no need to adapt the dose regimen of Amversio. 
Paediatric population 
Currently available data are described in section 5.1. 
Method of administration  
The bottle should be lightly shaken before opening. Three measuring spoons are provided which dispense 
either 100 mg, 150 mg or 1 g of betaine anhydrous. It is recommended that a heaped measuring spoon is 
removed from the bottle and a flat surface e.g. base of a knife is drawn across the top of the measure. This 
Assessment report  
EMA/203554/2022 
Page 9/19 
 
 
 
will give the following doses: the green measuring spoon dispenses 100 mg, the blue measuring spoon 
dispenses 150 mg and the purple measuring spoon dispenses 1 g of betaine anhydrous. 
The powder should be mixed with water, juice, milk, formula or food until completely dissolved and ingested 
immediately after mixing. 
Therapeutic monitoring 
The aim of treatment is to keep plasma levels of total homocysteine below 15 µmol/L or as low as possible. 
The steady state response usually occurs within a month. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction  
The finished product is presented as oral powder containing 1 g of betaine anhydrousas active substance.

blue measuring spoon dispenses 150 mg, and the purple measuring spoon dispenses 1 g. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of the active substance is N-trimethylglycine corresponding to the molecular formula 
C5H11NO2. It has a relative molecular weight of 117.15 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
The chemical structure of the active substance was elucidated by a combination of infra-red-(IR)-analysis, 
NMR (1H NMR, 13C NMR), MS, and elemental analysis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/203554/2022 
Page 10/19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The active substance is a very hygroscopic white crystals or white crystalline powder freely soluble in water. 
The active substance has a non - chiral molecular structure.  
Polymorphism has not been observed for the active substance.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of 
the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Betaine (anhydrous) is manufactured from technical grade betaine as the starting material. Betaine technical 
grade is extracted from sugar beet molasses. 
Justification for starting material designation based on ICHQ11 was provided in the restricted part of the ASMF. 
The  CHMP  agreed  with  the  justification  and  the  proposed  starting  material  “technical  grade  betaine”  was 
accepted. 
Betaine anhydrous is synthesized in 12 main steps using commercially available well defined starting 
materials with acceptable specifications. 
Critical steps in the manufacturing process were identified by a risk analysis (following the hazard analysis and 
critical control parameters (HACCP)-system) and they are documented, monitored and controlled. The proposed 
limits for the respective in-process controls are acceptable. 
In humans, betaine is a metabolite formed in the body from the well-described and known choline 
metabolism. The degradation pathways include a couple of demethylation steps to glycine.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The  active  substance  is  packaged  in  two  bags,  the  inner  polyethylene  bag  is  closed  with  a  clip,  the  outer 
laminated aluminium foil bag is heat-sealed, and both bags are protected by a fibre drum. In between the inner 
and outer bag some desiccant material is placed. Conformity with EC 10/2011 as amended has been confirmed 
for the inner layer bag. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (visual), odour (organoleptic), identification 
(FTIR), transmittance (UV/VIS), pH (Ph. Eur.), chlorides (Ph. Eur.), sulphates (Ph. Eur.), ammonium (colour 
reaction), iron (photometric detention), heavy metals (Colorimetry), arsenic (Ph. Eur.), amino acid analysis 
(Ph. Eur.), sugar impurities (HPLC), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), assay (Titration), 
total viable aerobic count (Ph. Eur.). 
Possible impurities from the starting materials could be some included amino acids or sugar residues. 
Accompanying amino acids are determined by using a specific method for eninhydrin positive substances with 
Assessment report  
EMA/203554/2022 
Page 11/19 
 
 
 
 
  
post column derivatisation. The levels are in accordance with the European Pharmacopeia requirements and 
the ICHQ3A and it is considered satisfactory. Absence of sugar residues has been verified. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data (3 commercial scale batches) of the active substance are provided. The results are within 
the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in 
the intended commercial package for up to 48 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and 
other 3 commercial batched stored for up 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according 
to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, odour, lost on drying, assay, transmittance, impurities, 
and total viable aerobic count. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability 
indicating.All tested parameters were within the specifications 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 48 months in the proposed container with 
restriction “Store in dry and dark in well closed drums.” 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as white crystalline free flowing powder. The qualitative and quantitative 
composition is shown in Table 2. 
Table 1: Composition of finished product 
The purpose of the product development was to produce a generic medicinal product Betaine anhydrous 1g 
oral powder, taking Cystadane as the reference product. 
Betaine anhydrous is known to be hygroscopic but remains free flowing when the moisture content is 
controlled. 
The active substance exists as three forms: anhydrous, monohydrate and hydrochloride. The anhydrous form 
was selected due to the better organoleptic properties in comparison to monohydrate and hydrochloride salts. 
Betaine in anhydrous form is a white crystalline powder. It is freely soluble in water. 
The finished product comprises the active substance only without the addition of any excipients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/203554/2022 
Page 12/19 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Betaine anhydrous is moisture sensitive. The physical proprieties of the product may change with high 
temperature and moisture. 
Amversio and Cystadane are chemically identical and accordingly contain the same active substance. No 
bioequivalence study between Amversio, and the reference medicinal product Cystadane has been provided, 
nor is such a study required. As the finished product contains betaine anhydrous only, with no excipients, and 
as the active substance is also freely soluble in water, the ‘oral solutions’ section of 
Appendix II of the guideline on bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/Corr **) applies. 
The manufacturing process is a simple filling process to fill the active substance into the primary packaging. 
Since the active substance is hygroscopic the product manufacturing is performed in a clean, humidity-
controlled environment to avoid any moisture ingress during manufacturing. Initially the active substance is 
sieved in a humidity-controlled room. Sieving is performed to remove any agglomerates or lumps. 
Filling of powder is also conducted in a humidity-controlled environment. Weight checks are performed during 
filling. The containers are induction sealed with an induction sealer at the specified setting to ensure no gaps 
or damage to the seal. Each container is then capped with a child-resistant cap. 
The primary packaging is white opaque HDPE bottles with a child resistant polypropylene cap with an induction 
seal liner, The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements.  
The primary packaging is further packed into a secondary carton containing three polypropylene dosing spoons. 
The three dosing spoons (green, blue, purple) are designed to dispense 100mg (0.14 cc), 150mg (0.22 cc) and 
1g (1.46 cc) powder dose, respectively. The three dosing spoons are CE marked. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 3 main steps: manufacturing process simply comprises filling, capping 
and cartoning.  The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Assessment report  
EMA/203554/2022 
Page 13/19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated in 3 batches at a 1/8th scale by a number of 
studies. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished 
product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The manufacturing process at full scale will be 
validated prior to commercial manufacture since this is a standard manufacturing process, this is considered 
satisfactory. No critical steps were identified and there are no intermediates in the process The in-process 
controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
appearance (visual), appearance of solution (visual), fill weight (gravimetry),  identification odour of powder 
(organoleptic), identification (FTIR), pH (Ph. Eur.), assay (titration, HPLC), trimethylamine (GC), loss of drying 
(Ph. Eur.), uniformity of mass of delivered dose (Ph. Eur.), and microbiology (Ph. Eur.). 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on 3 commercial 
scale batches using a validated ICP-MS, ICP-OES and GF-AAS methods was provided, demonstrating that 
each relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk 
assessment and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any 
elemental impurity controls.  
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for 
marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the 
“Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in 
human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided it is accepted that no 
risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related 
finished product. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed necessary.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for   testing has been 
presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 pilot scale batches confirming the consistency of the manufacturing 
process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing, 
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  from  3  pilot  scale  batches  of  finished  product  stored  for  up  to  24  months  under  long  term 
conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH and 30°C/65% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 
75%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  are  identical  to  those  proposed  for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. All containers were stored in an 
upright position during stability. 
Assessment report  
EMA/203554/2022 
Page 14/19 
 
 
 
Samples were tested for appearance of the finished product, appearance of a constituted solution, odour of 
powder, identification, pH, transmittance, loss on drying, assay, related substances, amino acids and residual 
saccharides, and microbiology. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
Product’s moisture content continues to remain below the limit of ≤2.0%. Assay remains within the 
specification range. Also, the related substance trimethylamine was not detected at any time point for all 
storage conditions. Trending suggests all parameters will remain within specification at 36 months. 
The finished product was tested for any change in quality of the product once the container was opened, the 
induction seal removed, and the polypropylene lid placed securely back onto the container. Two batches of 
Betaine were tested at 25ºC/60%RH. The rationale for this study was to establish the shelf- life of the 
product once the bottle is opened and induction seal removed. This study was performed for 6 months. All 
stability test parameters were within the agreed limits up to 3 months’ time point. At the 6-month time point, 
all parameters except loss on drying were well within limits. Therefore, once opened the finished product has 
a shelf life of 3 months. 
In-use stability reflecting the daily use were performed for 30 days on batches of the finished product under 
ambient  temperature  and  high  humidity  conditions  (75 % RH).  The  results  were  within  the  proposed 
specifications. Therefore, an in-use shelf life of 30 days can be assigned to the product. Additional results of 
stability testing performed on two batches of the finished product, in aqueous solution and in simulated gastric 
fluid were presented. Satisfactory assay results were provided for product solutions over 24 h in water and 2 
h in simulated gastric fluid. Therefore, the finished product was shown to be stable in aqueous solution and 
simulated gastric fluid justifying use of constituted solution on day of preparation and no anticipated changes 
to the product on ingestion are expected. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of the unopened bottle is 3 years, once the bottle is 
first opened the proposed shelf-life is 3 months and keep the bottle tightly closed in order to protect from 
moisture as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. One issue was raised by CHMP as Major Objections (MO). The MO was 
related to redefinition of starting material. The issue was resolved satisfactorily by the applicant as described 
above.  
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to 
generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical 
aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been 
discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  studies  were  submitted.  This  was  justified  by  the  applicant  as  the 
introduction of Amversio, a naturally occurring compound, manufactured by SERB SA is considered unlikely to 
result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all betaine anhydrous containing products 
and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar. 
2.3.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considers the justifications for absence of new non-clinical and ERA data as acceptable considering 
the type of application (natural occurring substance). 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for an oral powder containing betaine anhydrous 1g. To support the marketing 
authorisation application the applicant submitted an exemption to perform a bioequivalence study with the 
reference medicinal product, Cystadane.  
No formal scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product. For the clinical assessment 
Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1) in its current version is of 
particular relevance. 
Assessment report  
EMA/203554/2022 
Page 16/19 
 
 
 
Exemption 
No  bioequivalence  study  between  Amversio  and  the  reference  product  Cystadane  has  been  provided.  As 
Amversio  contains  betaine  only,  with  no  excipients,  and  as  betaine  is  also  freely  soluble  in  water,  the  ‘oral 
solutions’ section of Appendix II of the BE guideline (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr **) applies. This 
section states that: “If the test product is an aqueous oral solution at time of administration and contains an 
active  substance  in  the  same  concentration  as  an  approved  oral  solution,  bioequivalence  studies  may  be 
waived.” 
2.4.2.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
The CHMP considered that the relevant criteria were met for Amversio to support the above exemption. 
2.5.  Risk Management Plan 
2.5.1.  Safety concerns  
None. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacovigilance plan  
No additional pharmacovigilance activities. 
2.5.3.  Risk minimisation measures 
The safety information in the proposed product information is aligned to the reference medicinal product. 
No additional risk minimisation measures. 
2.5.4.  Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1 is acceptable.  
2.5.5.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.5.6.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

2.6.  Product information 
2.6.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This application concerns a generic version of betaine anhydrous as oral powder. The reference product 
Cystadane 1 g oral powder is indicated for the treatment of homocystinuria. No non-clinical studies have 
been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available nonclinical information for the 
active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical perspective, this application does 
not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of 
the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects based on information from 
published literature was considered sufficient. 
No bioequivalence study between Amversio and the reference medicinal product Cystadane has been 
performed. As Amversio contains betaine only, with no excipients, and as betaine is also freely soluble in 
water, the ‘oral solutions’ section of Appendix II of the BE guideline (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ 
Corr**) applies. This section states that: “If the test product is an aqueous oral solution at time of 
administration and contains an active substance in the same concentration as an approved oral solution, 
bioequivalence studies may be waived.” 
The CHMP considered that the relevant criteria were met for Amversio to support the above exemption. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those 
included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus/majority 
decision that the benefit-risk balance of Amversio is favourable in the following indication: 
Amversio is indicated as adjunctive treatment of homocystinuria, involving deficiencies or defects in:  
• 
• 
• 
cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS),  
5,10-methylene-tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR),  
cobalamin cofactor metabolism (cbl).  
Amversio should be used as supplement to other therapies such as vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), vitamin B12 
(cobalamin), folate and a specific diet. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following

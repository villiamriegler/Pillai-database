1.  Introduction 
On 21 June 2023, the MAH submitted the final clinical study report for a paediatric study for Zavicefta, 
in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. A short critical expert 
overview was provided. 
About the product 
Zavicefta - Ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ-AVI) – is a fixed dose combination (FDC) that has been 
developed as an IV administered compound for treatment of patients with infections caused by Gram-
negative pathogens, including pathogens that are resistant to ceftazidime. 
Ceftazidime is an injectable third generation cephalosporin antibiotic which has been in clinical use 
worldwide for more than 25 years for the treatment of infections caused by aerobic Gram-negative 
pathogens. Ceftazidime has been shown to be safe and effective in adult and paediatric patients 
(neonates to adolescents <18 years of age) for a range of indications. However, over the past 15 
years, resistance to ceftazidime has been increasing worldwide. The most common mechanism of 
resistance is bacterial production of β-lactamases, in particular, extended spectrum β-lactamases 
(ESBLs). 
Avibactam is a non-betalactam-lactamase inhibitor with a spectrum of beta-lactamases of class A and 
class C, including ESBLs and serine-based carbapenemases (KPCs). It also inhibits class D beta-
lactamases (e.g. OXA-48 type KPC). Avibactam has no inhibitory effect on class B metallo-beta-
lactamases. 
The fixed dose combination of CAZ-AVI was approved in the United States in 2015 for use in adults 
with cIAI (in combination with metronidazole), cUTI, or HAP/VAP, and in 2019 for use in children 3 
months of age and older with cIAI (in combination with metronidazole), or cUTI, under the brand name 
AVYCAZ. Approval for use in adults in the EU was granted in 2016 under the brand name Zavicefta. 
Extension of indication was approved in October 2020 to include paediatric patients aged 3 months to 
less than 18 years for Zavicefta (for the treatment of cIAI and cUTI, HAP/VAP and aerobic Gram-
negative infections in patients with limited treatment options).

The MAH submitted a final report for the paediatric study C3591024 (PIP, Measure 6). 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study C3591024: A Phase 2a, 2 Part, Open Label, Non-Randomized, Multicenter, Single and Multiple 
Dose Trial to Evaluate Pharmacokinetics, Safety and Tolerability of Ceftazidime and Avibactam in 
Neonates and Infants From Birth to Less Than 3 Months of Age With Suspected or Confirmed Infections 
due to Gram Negative Pathogens Requiring Intravenous Antibiotic Treatment  
Description 
Study C3591024 was a multicentre, open-label, single and multiple dose pharmacokinetic (PK) study. 
The primary objective of the study was to characterise PK of CAZ-AVI and assess its safety and 
tolerability in neonates and young infants aged from birth to <3 months. The efficacy was assessed as 
a secondary objective in the multiple dose part of the trial. The study outline is provided in Figure 1. 
The sequence of cohort startup is provided in Figure 2. 
This study was conducted in about 39 sites in 9 countries (Estonia, Greece, Hungary, India, Italy, 
Philippines, Slovakia, Taiwan, and USA). It was planned to enrol approximately 48 participants. 
However, the study was terminated early by the sponsor on 30 December 2022 due to slow 
recruitment and the collected PK data were by the MAH considered sufficient to support dose 
recommendations and safety/efficacy extrapolation for the neonatal age range. According to the MAH 
this decision was not due to safety concerns. 
Methods 
Study participants 
Participants were hospitalised neonates and infants who were receiving IV therapy for treatment of 
bacterial infection (Part A), and who were requiring IV antibacterial therapy due to suspected or 
confirmed aerobic Gram-negative bacterial infection (Part B). Patients with suspected or confirmed 
central nervous system infection were excluded. Patients with moderate or severe renal impairment 
defined as serum creatinine ≥2 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) for age OR urine output <0.5 
mL/kg/h (measured over at least 8 hours) OR requirement for dialysis were excluded. 
Parts A and B were divided in 3 age cohorts: 
• 
Cohort 1: Full term infants (gestational age ≥37 weeks) with chronological age >28 days to <3 
months (<89 days) or pre-term infants with corrected age >28 days to <3 months (<89 days) 
• 
• 
Cohort 2: Full term neonates (gestational age ≥37 weeks) from birth to ≤28 days 
Cohort 3: Pre-term neonates (gestational age ≥26 to <37 weeks) from birth to ≤28 days

Treatments 
In Part A, participants received a single IV infusion of CAZ-AVI over 2-hours (±10 min) on Day 1, 
according to their cohort as indicated in Table 1. 
In Part B, On Day 1, participants started receiving IV CAZ-AVI over 2-hours (±10 min) every 8 hours 
(±1 hour) according to their cohort as indicated in Table 1. Treatment was to continue for 2 to 14 days 
(with an optional switch to alternative oral therapy or OPAT with another IV antibiotic after at least 48 
hours of IV CAZ-AVI). The dose was to remain the same throughout the dosing period unless local 
standard practice was to reassess weight changes regularly (e.g. weekly) and make dose adjustments.

Protocol Table 2 
Dose rationale 
Dosing for this study was based on modelling and simulation study CAZ-MS-PED-02 which included 
data from the adult Phase 1, 2, and 3 studies, and three prior paediatric studies (patients aged 3 
months to <18 years): D4280C00014, D4280C00015/C3591004 and D4280C00016/C3591005. The 
exposure target was defined as achieving at least 50 percent of time during the dosing interval that 
CAZ and AVI are simultaneously above the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 8 mg/mL for 
CAZ and Critical threshold concentration (CT) of 1.0 mg/L for AVI, respectively. These are the same 
joint PK/PD targets used to support approval in adults. 
Of note, dosing recommendation for CAZ as monotherapy are 100-150 mg/kg/day (divided in three 
doses) and 25-60 mg/kg/day (divided in two doses) for infants >2 months and neonates/infants ≤2 
months, respectively. 
Objective(s) 
The following objectives and main endpoints were evaluated in paediatric patients from birth to less 
than 3 months who are hospitalised and receiving IV antibiotic therapy.

To evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
CAZ-AVI for the treatment of aerobic 
Gram-negative infection in neonates and 
infants from birth to <3 months. 
To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of 
multiple intravenous doses of CAZ-AVI in 
hospitalised neonates and infants from birth 
to <3 months. 
To evaluate the efficacy of CAZ-AVI for 
the treatment of aerobic Gram-negative 
infection in neonates and infants from birth

Safety and tolerability endpoints included AEs, 
SAEs, deaths, discontinuations due to AEs and 
laboratory abnormalities. 
CAZ and AVI plasma concentrations by 
nominal sampling time. 
Efficacy outcome measures included: 
•  All-cause mortality. 
•  Clinical outcome at EOIV, EOT, TOC, and 
LFU. 
•  Cure defined as clinical improvement and 
no need for further antibacterial treatment, 
7 to 14 days after EOT. 
•  Microbiological eradication 7 to 14 days 
after EOT (Micro-ITT Analysis Set). 
•  Emergent infections. 
Clinical response definitions at the EOT, TOC and LFU visits were cure, failure and indeterminate. 
For microbiology evaluations, blood, urine or other specimen and tissue samples from the infection site 
were obtained at TOC. All isolates were sent to the central laboratory for organism identification and 
susceptibility testing. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
See information under “Objectives” above. 
Blood samples for PK (0.3 mL per sample) were collected on Day 1 (Part A) or after at least 3 doses 
had been administered (Part B) at the following time points: 
1) anytime within 15 minutes prior to or 15 minutes after stopping CAZ-AVI infusion,  
2) anytime between 30 minutes and 90 minutes after stopping CAZ-AVI infusion, and  
3) anytime between 300 minutes (5 hours) and 360 minutes (6 hours) after stopping CAZ-AVI 
infusion. 
Preference was to be given to the first and third collection time if only two PK samples were obtained 
for any reason. 
PK samples were analysed using a validated analytical method (not specified) in compliance with 
Pfizer’s applicable SOPs by Labcorp Bioanalytical Laboratory. No bioanalytical reports has been included 
in the current submission.

Sample size 
The planned sample size (48 subjects; 3 cohorts of 16 subjects) was considered adequate to evaluate 
the pharmacokinetics of CAZ-AVI in neonates and infants and to provide critical insight into safety and 
toleration in this population. Similarly, the planned sample size in Part B (24 subjects, 3 cohorts of 8 
subjects) was considered adequate to provide insight into efficacy in this suspected or confirmed 
aerobic Gram-negative bacterial infection population. 
Statistical Methods 
Pharmacokinetic analysis:  The PK analysis set was defined as subjects who received a single IV dose 
of CAZ-AVI in Part A or at least 3 consecutive doses of CAZ-AVI in Part B with at least 1 ceftazidime 
and/or avibactam plasma PK measurement available. 
For each Part, A and B and each Cohort 1, 2, and 3, the plasma concentrations were summarised by 
nominal sampling time using descriptive statistics (e.g., number, mean, standard deviation [SD], 
minimum, median, maximum, geometric mean, and coefficient of variation [CV]). 
For 1 participant (Part A, Cohort 1), there was a deviation in the procedure for dilution of the stock 
volume of the study intervention. It is presumed an unknown and undocumented error occurred in the 
dose administered as a result of the documented procedural deviation based on the participant’s 
plasma CAZ and AVI concentrations being markedly higher than expected; therefore, additional 
pharmacokinetic analyses were provided excluding this 1 participant. 
The MAH states that the avibactam and ceftazidime concentration, paediatric subject demographics, 
and disease status data from Cohorts 1 to 3 will be combined with the data from appropriate previous 
clinical studies in paediatric subjects and/or adults for a population PK (popPK) analysis. The actual 
dosing and plasma sampling times will be used for the analysis. A stand-alone population PK modelling 
and simulation analysis plan will be prepared, and the results will be reported in a stand-alone report, 
for each Part A and Part B, outside of the clinical study report (not submitted in this Art. 46 
procedure). 
Results 
Recruitment/Number analysed 
A total of 48 participants were enrolled in the study and 46 participants were treated. The analysis sets 
are shown below.

Eleven participants in Part B were excluded from the Micro-ITT Analysis Set at Screening because no 
baseline Gram-negative pathogen was isolated: 1 participant in Cohort 1, all 5 participants in Cohort 2, 
and 5 participants in Cohort 3. 
Baseline data 
In Part A (N=25), over half of the participants were female (60%) and were White (72%). The median 
(min, max) age was 25 (2, 89) days and the median (min, max) corrected age was 45 (34, 56) days. 
In Part B (N=21), over half of the participants were male (52.4%) and were White (85.7%). The 
median (min, max) age was 23 (6, 86) days. 
Gestational age across cohorts is given in Table 5. All participants in Cohorts 1 and 2 were ≥37 weeks 
gestational age, except 2 participants in Part A, Cohort 1 (34-36 weeks). Most participants in Cohort 3 
were 30 to 33 weeks gestational age (7 and 5 participants in Part A and Part B, respectively). The 
youngest participants were 31 weeks gestation (7 and 1 participants in Part A and Part B, 
respectively). Four participants in Cohort 3 were 34-36 gestational age (1 and 3 participants in Part A 
and Part B, respectively).

Median (min, max) weight was 4.9 (3.3, 6.4) kg, 3.5 (3.1, 4.0) kg, and 1.7 (1.3, 2.6) kg for Part A, 
Cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively, and 4.3 (2.9, 6.0) kg, 2.9 (2.2, 3.6) kg, and 1.8 (1.5, 2.5) kg for 
Part B, Cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively. 
The most common primary infectious diagnoses were sepsis (18 participants [39.1%]) and urinary 
tract infection (7 participants [15.2%]). For Part B, median time from the diagnosis to the study 
intervention administration was 2 days. 
In Part B, the most frequently reported baseline pathogen (Micro-ITT Set) was Escherichia coli. In the 
Micro-ITT Analysis Set, 2 participants in Part B (Cohorts 1 and 3) had isolates that were resistant to 
ceftazidime (E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae). No isolates tested were reported as resistant to CAZ-
AVI. 
In Part A, 24 participants (96.0%) reported prior antibiotic medications. The most frequently reported 
prior antibiotic medications were vancomycin, amikacin and ampicillin. 
In Part B, 13 (61.9%) and 17 participants (81.0%) received permissible concomitant antibiotic 
medications during the Treatment Phase and the Follow-Up Phase, respectively. Two participants 
received nonpermitted antibiotics during the Treatment Phase, including cefazolin, meropenem, and 
commercial CAZ-AVI. Concomitant antibiotic medications were not restricted during the Follow-Up 
Phase and the majority of Part B participants received other antibiotics during this phase. 
Pharmacokinetic results 
Overall, 45 participants had at least 1 CAZ and/or AVI plasma measurement available and were 
included in the PK Analysis Set. Summaries of CAZ and AVI plasma concentrations according to 
nominal sampling time points are given in Table 6 and Table 7. Box and whisker plots of plasma 
concentrations versus nominal time are presented by cohort for Parts A and B in Figure 3. 
The MAH states that median plasma concentrations of CAZ and AVI were generally similar across 
Cohorts 1 to 3 in Parts A and B although concentrations were slightly lower in Cohort 2 compared to 
those observed in Cohorts 1 and 3 in Part A. Plasma concentrations were higher for early samples 
taken near the EOI at 2 hours and lower for samples taken near the end of the dosing interval at 7 
hours. Inter-participant variability (CV%) was higher for Cohort 1 in Part A due to one medication error 
in 1 participant and for samples taken at 7 hours in both Part A and Part B due to wide window of PK 
sampling collection times. 
Box and whisker plots of plasma concentrations versus nominal time excluding the participant with 
medication error are presented in Figure 4.

Efficacy results 
In Study C3591024, efficacy was assessed as secondary endpoint and the results presented below are 
descriptive. 
All-Cause Mortality (Part B) 
One participant (4.8%) (Part B, Cohort 3) died on Study Day 35 due to SAEs of necrotising colitis and 
septic shock which was considered not related to study intervention by the investigator. 
In addition, 1 participant (Part B, Cohort 1) died on Study Day 67, after completing the LFU Visit. As 
this event occurred outside the active data collection period, it was not included in the analysis of all-
cause mortality. 
Clinical Outcome at TOC (Part B) 
The proportion of participants with a favourable clinical outcome at TOC was 81% (17 of 21 
participants) in the ITT Analysis Set, and the proportion of participants with a favourable 
microbiological response at TOC was 80% (8 of 10 participants) in the Micro-ITT Analysis Set.  
At TOC, 12 of 16 participants (75.0%) in the Modified-ITT Analysis Set had a favourable clinical 
outcome (clinical cure or clinical improvement).

Microbiological Response (Part B) 
At TOC, a favourable per-participant microbiological response rate (eradication or presumed 
eradication) of 80.0% was observed in the Micro-ITT Analysis Set (N=21).  
Nine baseline Enterobacterales were isolated in 10 participants. An unfavourable microbiological 
response was reported for one pathogen because the participant was assessed as a clinical failure at 
EOIV. 
The most frequently reported baseline pathogen was Escherichia coli (6 isolates), and favourable 
microbiological responses were observed for all 6 (4 eradication and 2 presumed eradication).

Safety results 
Extent of Exposure 
In Part A, the median duration of CAZ-AVI treatment was 2.00 hours (min-max:1.8-2.4 h). In Part B, 
the median duration of CAZ-AVI treatment was 7.00 days (min-max:1.0-12.0 d). 
Adverse events

Causalities) by Part - Safety Analysis Set 
Incidence of Adverse Events 
Overall, up to LFU, the most frequently reported all-causality TEAEs by PT in 3 or more participants (≥
5%) were sepsis, anaemia, and vomiting (Table 10). The majority of all-causality TEAEs were mild or 
moderate in severity. Five participants (10.9%) reported severe all-causality TEAEs up to LFU, all of 
which were considered not related to study intervention by the investigator.  
One participant (Part A, Cohort 3) experienced a mild treatment-related TEAE of decreased oxygen 
saturation during the Follow-up Phase. No other treatment-related TEAEs were reported up to LFU. In 
Part B, no treatment-related TEAEs were reported up to LFU.

Clinical Laboratory Evaluation 
In Part A, no clinically meaningful mean changes from baseline were observed in haematology, blood 
chemistry, or urinalysis parameters. There were a few individual clinically significant laboratory 
abnormalities, which were considered unrelated to study intervention and related to the participants’ 
underlying condition. 
In Part B, elevated C-reactive protein levels were observed, consistent with signs of infection, which 
normalised during the course of treatment in most participants (where data were available). In 
addition, increases in lymphocyte counts, lymphocyte/leukocyte ratio, eosinophil counts, and 
eosinophil/leukocyte ratio were observed in several participants, consistent with their underlying 
condition. 
No clinically meaningful changes from baseline were observed in urinalysis parameters in Part B. 
Some laboratory abnormalities were reported as TEAEs, all of which were considered unrelated to 
study intervention by the investigator. 
No clinically meaningful changes from baseline were observed in urine outputs in Parts A or B. 
Vital Signs and Physical Findings 
A mild treatment-related TEAE of oxygen saturation decreased was reported for 1 participant. The 
event started on Study Day 1 and resolved within approximately 1 day. Otherwise, no clinically 
meaningful changes were observed in vital sign measurements (SBP, DBP, PR, oxygen saturation, 
weight, temperature, and respiratory rate) in Part A or Part B of the study respectively. 
In Part A, the majority of participants had normal physical examination findings at each study visit.  
In Part B, the majority of participants had normal physical examination findings at each study visit with 
the exception of general appearance and skin (e.g., poor general clinical condition, appearance of ill

neonate, and jaundiced skin; which is consistent with and not unexpected for hospitalised neonates 
and infants (up to 3 months of age) with suspected or confirmed aerobic Gram-negative bacterial 
infection requiring IV antibacterial therapy.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The MAH has submitted the final clinical study report for the paediatric study 
C3591024/D4280C00017, which is part of the agreed PIP (study 6). The primary objectives of the 
study were to characterise PK and evaluate safety of CAZ-AVI in hospitalised neonates and infants 
from birth to <3 months, including preterm neonates. The weight- and age-based doses used in the 
study were selected based on simulations by a popPK model previously developed using data from 
adult and paediatric patients in the age range of 3 months-18 years (CAZ-MS-PED-02, submitted in 
procedure EMEA/H/C/004027/II/0015). 
Single or multiple dose PK data was obtained from in total 17 infants aged >28 days to <3 months, 12 
full-term neonates ≤28 days and 16 pre-term neonates ≤28 days. Two of the infants >28 days were 
pre-term (gestational age 34-36 weeks). Of the pre-term neonates ≤28 days, 12 had a gestational age 
of 31-33 weeks and 4 had a gestational age of 34-36 weeks. 
There are no expected differences in the mechanism of action of CAZ-AVI based on age as both CAZ 
and AVI exert their effects by acting on the causative pathogen, and the Gram-negative causative 
pathogens are similar in adults and children. The same joint PK/PD targets are therefore relevant for 
dose selection in paediatric patients, and extrapolation of efficacy is possible provided that exposure 
levels are comparable to adults (EMA/CHMP/187859/2017). The acceptability of extending the 
indication to paediatric subpopulations relies therefore largely on the demonstration of comparable 
exposures to those achieved in the Phase III studies in adult patients, and on demonstration of an 
acceptable safety profile. 
Sparse sampling was performed in the current study with three blood samples collected from each 
patient. Consequently, PK parameters could not be calculated by non-compartmental analysis, and the 
MAH has presented tabular and graphical summaries of CAZ and AVI plasma concentrations according 
to nominal time points [2h (end of infusion), 2.5h and 7h post-dose]. The exposures achieved in these 
paediatric cohorts in comparison to adults receiving the approved CAZ-AVI doses and attainment of the 
PK/PD targets have not been discussed by the MAH. Therefore, the appropriateness of the dose 
regimens used in this study cannot be assessed at this stage. An updated popPK analysis including all 
available paediatric PK data and PTA simulations in the relevant age cohorts is awaited. 
CAZ and AVI are eliminated by the kidneys, and Zavicefta is dosed to paediatric patients according to 
age, type of infection and estimated BSA-normalised creatinine clearance (Schwartz bedside formula). 
In the paediatric PK data set supporting the extension of indication down to 3 months of age, data in 
patients with moderate or severe renal impairment was very limited and only 1 patient had a CrCL <50 
mL/min/1.73 m2 with a reported baseline value of 43 mL/min/kg2. Still, dosing recommendations have 
been approved for all renal function categories for children >2 years, and for children aged 3 months-2 
years with creatinine clearance down to 16 mL/min/1.73 m2 (EMEA/H/C4027/II/005). Dose 
recommendations in renally impaired children <2 years were based on simulations in which the effect 
of moderate and severe renal impairment on CL was accounted for by adjustment factors derived from 
adult renal function categories. This approach was at that time considered acceptable considering that 
(i) dosing recommendations are given for ceftazidime as monotherapy in children <40 kg with a CrCL 
down to 5 mL/min, (ii) the exposure of avibactam has been shown to be roughly parallel to that of 
ceftazidime also in this age cohort, and (iii) the conducted simulations supported adequate PTAs for 
the investigated dosing regimens.

Data is now available from pre-term and term neonates and infants <3 months. Children born at term 
are expected to have a GFR of approximately 10-20 mL/min/1.73m2 the first day of life. Thereafter, 
rising up to approximately 30-40 mL/min/1.73m2 after two weeks, adult levels are reached first at two 
years of age. In preterm neonates, the expected GFR is even lower than in children born at term and 
rises more slowly than in children born at term. Estimated CrCL/GFR values for patients included in 
study C3591024 were not provided. Even though patients with moderate and severe renal impairment 
(defined as serum creatinine ≥2 times the ULN for age, urine output <0.5 mL/kg/h or requirement for 
dialysis) were excluded, it is therefore expected that the range of renal function in the current study 
will span lower compared to the previous paediatric studies. In the updated popPK analyses, 
exposure/PK characteristics of CAZ-AVI according to age, weight, renal function (and other covariates 
if relevant) for children <2 years should therefore be re-explored. The updated popPK models should 
be used to establish dosing regimens according to age (and weight/renal function if appropriate) in 
patients <3 months. The updated model could also be used to confirm previous model predictions at 
low weight and low renal function, and thereby support already approved dosing regimens for children 
≥3 months to <2 years. 
In Study C3591024, efficacy was assessed as secondary endpoint, and hence the presented data were 
only descriptive. At TOC 81% (17/21) of participants in the ITT Analysis Set had a favourable clinical 
outcome, and 80% (8/10) of participants in the Micro-ITT Analysis Set had a favourable microbiological 
response. The interpretation of the efficacy outcomes in newborns to <3 months of age is hampered 
by the low number of participants with confirmed infection due to Gram negative bacteria (n=10). 
Safety was a secondary endpoint in part A, and a primary endpoint in part B of this study. The study 
enrolled 27 participants (only 25 were evaluable for adverse events) in part A and 21 participants in 
part B. As expected, the incidence of adverse events was lower in the single-dose part A of the study, 
32 %, compared to the multiple-dose in part B (71.4%). Although low number of events, serious 
adverse events were observed twice as frequent in part B, 23.8%, compared to part A, 12%. However, 
none of the SAEs were considered treatment-related by the investigator. 
Severe adverse events were reported almost 5-times as frequent in part B (19%) compared to Part A 
(4.0%), however, none were considered treatment-related. 
Discontinuation of study drug due to AEs were only reported in part B; 2/21 subjects. 
Two deaths were reported, one during the study and one 55 days after end of study treatment. Both 
were considered due to underlying conditions and not related to treatment. 
Of note, some of the TEAEs classified as unrelated to study treatment are known ADR listed for 
Zavicefta, such as candidiasis, diarrhoea, vomiting and pyrexia. The classification of these events as 
unrelated must be further discussed and justified by the MAH in the upcoming type II variation 
application. No other new or unexpected safety findings were identified. 
In conclusion, the final report for Study C3591024 including PK, safety and efficacy data has been 
submitted. The MAH stated that sufficient PK data was collected to support dose recommendations and 
safety/efficacy extrapolation for the neonatal age range. As the updated popPK analysis and PTA 
simulations have not been submitted in the current Article 46 procedure, the PK bridge and 
appropriateness of the dose regimens used in the above-mentioned study have not been assessed. 
Therefore, no conclusions can be drawn regarding the benefit/risk balance of CAZ-AVI in neonates and 
young infants aged birth to <3 months at this stage. An application for extension of indication to this 
age group based on the data submitted is expected.

3.  Overall conclusion and recommendation 
A detailed critical assessment of the data from Study C3591024 has not been performed as part of this 
Article 46 procedure P46 005. The MAH has notified to EMA (21 June 2023) that they intend to submit 
a Type II variation in Q4 2023. A variation application to extend the indication to the paediatric 
population from birth to less than 3 months of age based on data from Study C3591024 and modelling 
and simulation analyses is thus expected, and a complete assessment of the benefit/risk balance of 
CAZ-AVI in this age group will then be performed based on the full relevant data package.  
This PAM (P46 005) is considered fulfilled, solely based on the fact that the study data have been 
provided. No changes to the SmPC are recommended as part of this procedure’s assessment. However, 
this conclusion is based on the prerequisite that the MAH applies for an extension of the indication for 
Zavicefta within a reasonable time frame. I is expected that the relevant application will be submitted 
by the MAH by the end of 2023. 
 Fulfilled: 
No further action is required in the current procedure. However, additional modelling and simulation 
data are expected in the context of a variation application for extension of indication prior to any 
conclusion on product information amendments. The MAH should submit this extension application 
within 2023.

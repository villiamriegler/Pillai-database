The procedure started on 27 August 1999 
The Rapporteur's first assessment report was circulated to all CPMP Members on 5 November 
1999.  The  Co-Rapporteur's  first  assessment  report  was  circulated  to  all  CPMP  Members  on  5 
November 1999. 
During  the  meeting  on  14  –  16  December  1999  the  CPMP  agreed  on  the  consolidated  list  of 
questions  to  be  sent  to  the  company.  The  final  consolidated  list  of  questions  was  sent  to  the 
company on 16 December 1999. 
The  summary  report  of  the  inspection  carried  out  at  the  manufacturing  sites  between  29 
February and 2 March 2000, dated 13 March 2000, was issued on 15 March 2000.  
The  company  submitted  the  responses  to  the  CPMP  consolidated  list  of  questions  on  13  June 
2000, and the clock started for the second evaluation phase on 23 June 2000. 
The Rapporteur circulated the joint assessment report on the company’s responses to the list of 
questions to all CPMP Members on 21 August 2000. 
Arising from the Joint Assessment Report, a number of issues of concern were identified by the 
CPMP and a list of unresolved issues was adopted at the September 2000 meeting and sent to 
the applicant, with a view to a future oral explanation.  
The  applicant subsequently requested an extension to the time  allowed for preparation  for the 
oral explanation, and this was agreed by CPMP. 
During the CPMP meeting on 12-14 December 2000, outstanding issues were addressed by the 
applicant  during  a  hearing  before  the  CPMP.  Following  discussion  of  the  applicant’s 
presentation, the CPMP, in the light of the overall data submitted and the scientific discussion 
within  the  Committee,  issued  a  positive  opinion  for  granting  a  Marketing  Authorisation  to 
SonoVue on 14 December 2000. 
The  CPMP  opinions  were  forwarded,  in  all  official  languages  of  the  European  Union,  to  the 
European Commission, which adopted the corresponding Decisions on 26 March 2001.

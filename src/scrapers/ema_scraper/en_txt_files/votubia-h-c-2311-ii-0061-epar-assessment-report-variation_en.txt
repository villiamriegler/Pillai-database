2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The current variation seeks to extend the indication of TSC-associated refractory partial onset seizures 
(POS) which is approved for patients ≥ 2 years to patients as young as 6 months of age. This application 
Assessment report  
EMA/471889/2020 
Page 6/36 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
is based on extrapolated results for efficacy from available patient data in TSC studies already submitted 
during earlier procedures, and safety data from internal and external databases. No new clinical studies 
have been conducted for this application. 
Biologic features 
TSC is a rare and debilitating disease with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 6000 live births (Krueger 
and Franz, 2008). It is an autosomal dominant genetic condition involving the tuberous sclerosis 1 gene 
(TSC1) and/or the tuberous sclerosis 2 gene (TSC2). Deficiency of either gene leads to upregulation of 
mTORC1 resulting in abnormal cellular growth, proliferation, and protein synthesis, which can cause a 
variety of benign tumours, or hamartomas, in multiple organ systems including lesions in the kidney, 
brain, skin, lung and heart.  
Neuropathologic lesions of TSC include subependymal nodules, subependymal giant-cell astrocytoma 
(SEGA), cortical hamartomas, areas of focal cortical hypoplasia and heterotopic gray matter (Takanashi et 
al 1995, Weiner et al 1998). The predominant neurological manifestations of TSC are mental retardation, 
epileptic seizures and behavioural abnormalities (Gomez 1999, Curatolo 2003, Chu-Shore et al 2010). 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Epileptogenesis in TSC can start far before birth. Mutation of TSC1/2 genes leads to overactivity of the 
mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway, which can predispose to epilepsy. These changes can 
appear during fetal life (Overwater et al 2015, Moavero and Curatolo, 2018). 
Epilepsy is a common manifestation of TSC, affecting up to 85% of patients. The majority (63%) of TSC 
patients experience seizure onset within the first year of life. In early onset, epilepsy may manifest as 
infantile spasms or focal (partial) seizures, which can coexist (Chu-Shore et al 2010). Early management 
of seizures is important in preventing subsequent epileptic encephalopathy and in reducing the cognitive 
and neuropsychiatric consequences (Davis et al 2017, Moavero and Curatolo, 2018, Wang and Fallah, 
2014). 
Refractory seizures (resistant to first-line pharmacological interventions like vigabatrin, adreno-
corticotrophic hormone, and other anti-epileptic drugs acting on the GABA pathway) occur in up to 67% 
patients. There are only a few studies with sufficiently large sample size focused on infants with TSC and 
epilepsy. In a study to assess the response to anti-epileptic drugs (19 in total) in 71 children with TSC, 
only 30% patients achieved remission beyond 24 months. In another study with 122 children, where the 
youngest child was 2 months of age, significant seizure-free remission was achieved in not more than 
14% children (Sparagana et al 2003, Moavero and Curatolo 2018, Overwater et al 2015). 
Management 
Seizures associated with TSC are treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) or methods such as epilepsy 
surgery, vagal nerve stimulator or ketogenic diet. Other than for infantile spasms in TSC for which 
vigabatrin is usually recommended as first line treatment, there is little evidence to guide effective 
anticonvulsant treatment. The published literature suggests that TSC-associated partial onset seizures 
(POS) may respond to one or several AEDs approved for the treatment of POS, e.g. topiramate, 
lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, and clobazam. The prevalence of medically refractory epilepsy 
in TSC even with adequate trials of currently available anticonvulsant medications has been reported as 
high at approximately 60% (Jobst 2009; Wong 2010).

2.1.2.  About the product 
Votubia contains the active substance everolimus, an antineoplastic and immunomodulating agent with 
currently two ATC codes (L01XE10 and L04AA18 respectively), which acts as selective inhibitor of the 
mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a serine-threonine kinase within the mTOR-raptor signal 
transduction complex 1 (mTORC1) which is involved in the regulation of protein synthesis, cell growth, 
proliferation and survival. Due to its immunosuppressing activity, everolimus was initially developed to 
prevent allograft rejection following solid organ transplantation. In the EU, everolimus is approved under 
the tradename Afinitor for the treatment of patients with advanced renal cell cancer, advanced 
neuroendocrine tumours, and hormone receptor-positive advanced breast cancer.  
Votubia has been authorised in the EU/EEA through the centralised procedure by Commission Decision in 
September 2011 for treatment of (renal angiomyolipoma [subject to a later variation] and) subependymal 
giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). It is available as tablets 
(2.5, 5 and 10 mg) and dispersible tablets (1, 2, 3 and 5 mg). Everolimus dispersible tablets under the 
trade name Votubia received approval from the European Commission in January 2017 for a third TSC 
manifestation, i.e. adjunctive treatment of patients aged 2 years and older whose refractory partial onset 
seizures (POS), with or without secondary generalization, are associated with TSC. This approval was 
based on the results of Study CRAD001M2304 (also referred as M2304, or EXIST-3), a Phase 3 study 
including 294 paediatric patients aged 2-18 years with TSC-associated refractory POS. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
On 23-Jan-2013, the European Medicines Agency agreed on a PIP for ‘refractory epilepsy associated with 
TSC’ and granted a deferral to everolimus (P/0012/2013). In 2017, the PIP was modified (EMEA-C-
000019-PIP08-12-M03). A study in patients less than 2 years of age with infantile spasm was removed, 
and a modelling and simulation study, which extrapolates data from existing studies to the target 
population, was added in order to complete the paediatric development of everolimus in patients below 
the age of 2 with refractory POS associated with TSC. The proposed models incorporated a 
physiologically-based pharmacokinetic model (PBPK) to predict everolimus PK parameters in patients 6 
months to 1 year of age, a population pharmacokinetic (popPK) and population PD (popPD) model to 
predict short-term efficacy, and an exposure-efficacy linear mixed model to predict long-term efficacy. In 
effect, the proposed models would evaluate efficacy in patients between 6 months to 2 years of age. 
In addition, a waiver was granted for patients from birth to <6 months of age on the grounds that 
everolimus does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit in the treatment of infantile spasms over 
existing treatments. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
According to EMEA-000019-PIP08-12-M02 and P/0316/2017, a non-clinical evaluation is not applicable. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The applicant submitted an environmental risk assessment on the active ingredient everolimus dated on 
August 2019 consisting of a justification for not providing an updated environmental risk assessment in 
the current Type II Variation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/471889/2020 
Page 8/36 
 
 
  
  
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A complete ERA for the active ingredient everolimus was provided within procedure EMEA/H/C/2311/II/41 
in 2016. Everolimus was not considered to pose a risk to the environment. Since the PEC calculations in 
the above-mentioned ERA were based on a fraction of market penetration (Fpen) of 0.01, representing 
1% of the population also the patient population aged 6 months to 2 years was included in these 
calculations. 
Based on the provided data, everolimus is not considered to pose a risk to the environment including 
surface waters, sewage treatment plants, groundwater, terrestrial compartments and sediments. 
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
This application does not lead to a significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of 
everolimus. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In the EU, Everolimus is currently approved in three TSC manifestations:  
- SEGA (in adult and paediatric patients; however, the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile of 
Votubia in children below the age of 1 year with TSC who have SEGA have not been established),  
- renal angiomyolipoma (in adult patients only), and  
- adjunctive treatment of refractory partial-onset seizures (POS) in (adult and paediatric) patients aged 2 
years and older.  
The applicant is now seeking extension of the indication of TSC-associated refractory POS from adults and 
children aged 2 years and older to children as old as 6 months of age.  
The clinical studies in TSC patients supporting this application have been submitted previously. No new 
studies have been performed for this submission. The efficacy and safety data relevant to patients 
between 6 months and 2 years of age are obtained from modelling and simulation exercises and safety 
databases.  The clinical trials summarized in the following table served as the source for these exercises; 
they are not used directly to impute the conclusions of the MAH.

2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Objectives 
The proposed modelling and simulation study is aimed at completing the paediatric development by 
predicting exposure in patients 6 months old to 1 year of age (target population for PK) and everolimus 
efficacy in patients from 6 months to less than 2 years of age (target population for efficacy). The 
predicted exposure and efficacy, is used to justify the safe and efficient use of everolimus in patients 
between 6 months and 2 years. 
M&S approach 
The modelling and simulation framework consists of 3 different models that were used in conjunction to 
enable the prediction of precise and reliable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic markers in children 
between 6 months and less than 2 years of age. The first model, a physiology-based pharmacokinetic 
(PBPK) model was built and qualified using currently available PK data in children (≥1 year of age) and 
adults using the Simcyp® simulation software. The PBPK model was used to predict Cmin exposure in 
paediatric patients. This Cmin exposure was then be used as regressor to predict the response

(percentage reduction from baseline in seizure frequency). The response was predicted using two 
exposure-response models, a population pharmacodynamic model and a linear mixed effect model. These 
models were built upon the PD data from study M2304, because this is the only study with POS. These 
models were used to predict the short-term and long-term efficacy in patients under 2 years.  
These three models were developed based on data from three clinical trials which enrolled patients in the 
TSC setting. These data were used to validate the models before performing the predictions: 
-  Study CRAD001M2301 with patients 1 year of age and older with SEGA associated with TSC, to 
provide pharmacokinetic data. Youngest patient’s age: 1.1 year, n=10 patients between the age 
of 1-2 years. 
-  Study CRAD001M2302, performed in the adult population with renal AML associated with TSC, to 
provide pharmacokinetic data. 
-  Study CRAD001M2304 (core phase analysis) with patients 2 years and older with refractory POS 
associated with TSC, to provide pharmacokinetic and short-term pharmacodynamics data. Study 
CRAD001M2304 (Extension analysis) with patients 2 years and older with refractory POS 
associated with TSC, to provide pharmacokinetic and long-term pharmacodynamic data.

Background 
Everolimus is primarily eliminated by metabolism via CYP3A4 and is a substrate for PgP. Data in patients 
with TSC suggested that everolimus clearance was lower in younger patients, while BSA-normalized 
everolimus clearance was higher in younger patients as indicated by dose-normalized Cmin. 
The approved dosing method consists of starting doses and the pre-dose everolimus concentration range 
for therapeutic drug monitoring for patients with TSC-SEGA and TSC-seizures.

PBPK model 
Model building 
The software Simcyp was used for model building and simulations. An adult PBPK model was built to 
predict everolimus PK after single and multiple doses and to ensure proper definition of its clearance 
pathways using the available clinical mass-balance and in vitro phenotyping and clinical DDI data with 
CYP3A4 perpetrators. The developed PBPK model was then qualified to predict the adult TSC patient PK 
data from trials CRAD001M2301, CRAD001M2302, and CRAD001M2304, including PK parameters 
measured in the sub-study of CRAD001M2301. 
These adult PBPK model RAD001 (everolimus) compound file input parameters were first used in the 
paediatric Simcyp model (where demographics, physiology, and ontogeny of clearance pathways vary 
with age). However, there was a consistent under-prediction of Cmin and over-prediction of the apparent 
Cmax across the ages and dose groups when the Simcyp paediatric model was used. An improvement 
was made using a more recently published ontogeny for CYP3A4 (Upreti and Wahlstrom 2016) rather 
than the current ontogeny in the Simcyp paediatric model. The apparent Cmin values were improved; 
however, the Cmax values were still over-predicted, particularly for subjects <12 years of age. For 
subjects < 12 years of age, the absorption parameter, fa, was reduced to 0.5 (from fa=1 in adults) and 
distribution parameters were also adjusted. For subjects < 12 years of age, distribution parameters were 
based upon simultaneous parameter estimation simulations in Simcyp. The applicant stated that although 
the reason for the modification of absorption and distribution parameters of RAD001 for the younger 
paediatric population is unclear, it may be a combination of RAD001 distribution into higher fat content in 
children compared to healthy adults and the potential greater impact of food intake on the absorption of 
RAD001 in children. The model was built originally for healthy adult volunteers in a fasted condition. 
There is a negative food effect with low fat food reducing the AUC by 30-32% and Cmax by 42-50% 
(regular or dispersible tablets) and, for the trials used in the qualification, RAD001 could be taken just 
after a low fat meal (M2301, M2303, M2304). The modifications of the absorption and distribution 
parameters were deemed appropriate by the applicant to simulate the apparent Cmax and Cmin 
concentration values across the pediatric age range of 1 to <12 years of age and across the examined 
dose ranges. 
Model evaluation 
The PBPK model for RAD001 was developed first to simulate the single and multiple dose PK of RAD001 in 
adults. The observed and simulated PK parameters for RAD001 after single oral doses (2 and 4 mg) in 
healthy volunteers were compared. All the PK parameters were predicted within 2-fold of the actual value 
(prediction errors < -50% and > +100%).  
The PBPK model was also built to predict the magnitude of the interaction of RAD001 with CYP3A4 
perpetrators ketoconazole, erythromycin, and rifampin. All PK parameters were predicted within 2-fold of 
the actual values and the DDI (AUC and Cmax ratios) were predicted within 40% of the actual values and 
within the criteria outlined in Guest et al 2011. Therefore, the contribution of CYP3A4 to the clearance of 
RAD001 in adults was deemed to be well defined.  
The PBPK model was then qualified to predict the PK of RAD001 in adult TSC patients. All simulated 
parameters were predicted within a prediction error <40%.  
After refinement of the model for paediatric use, the observed individual patient data from Study 
CRAD001M2301 and from Study CRAD001M2304 were compared to the predicted concentrations.  
The ages were grouped: 1-3 years, 3-6 years, 6-12 years, and 12-18 years.

In table 6-5 (for the ages from 1 to >18 years) and table 6-7 (for ages 3 to <10 years) PBPK-simulated 
PK parameters are compared with the population PK results (RAD001 PopPK Report 2017). Particularly for 
the young ages (ages 1-12 years), the PBPK model simulated the mean BSA corrected blood CLpo and 
ratio of the clearances in children versus adults with a prediction error within ~ ±10%. For older children 
(age 12-18) the simulations had a prediction error of ~ -30%.  
For the youngest investigated patients (1-2 years) PBPK-simulated and observed concentrations are 
depicted in figure 8-5.

PopPK model 
The PopPK model was developed from a previous model with a two-compartment structure with first-
order absorption (ka) and elimination (Cl), developed based on data from the extension of study 
[CRAD001M2301 population PK - 5 years update]. This model was evaluated using pooled data from 
Studies M2301, M2302, and M2304 (core and extension phase) that included 7,262 observations from 
539 patients, the youngest age being 1 year old. The population PK model adequately described the data 
from studies M2301, M2302, and M2304. Time-varying CYP3A4 inducer status was retained as covariate 
on central clearance (Cl), and time-varying BSA was on all parameters related to volume and clearance. 
Mean clearance, either associated or not with the use of a CYP3A4 inducer, was positively related to age. 
When corrected by body surface area (L/h/m2), the mean clearances were near 20 L/h/m2 with a slight 
decrease with increasing age. Adults without inducers had a lower mean BSA-corrected clearance of 
13.66 L/h/m2. Body surface area corrected CL demonstrated consistent variability over the age range, 
with and without inducer, with a coefficient of variation of 30- 40%. This model, was used for Cmin 
prediction in the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis.

Exposure-response  
Pharmacodynamic modelling of everolimus effect on refractory partial-onset seizures associated with 
tuberous sclerosis complex aimed at assessing the efficacy of everolimus when Cmin is included within 5 
to 15 ng/mL. Three different models were developed to evaluate this relation. 
Prediction of short-term efficacy 
The PKPD model consisted of three submodels: the baseline model, the placebo model and the everolimus 
model. 
The baseline disease was developed using the screening phase data, before administration of the first 
dose (either placebo or everolimus) for all patients. Demographic covariate (age, body surface area, 
Race, Gender and comedications) effects on mean number of seizures were assessed. The placebo effect 
was added in addition to the baseline model and demographic/comedications effects. The everolimus 
effect was added by analyzing the entire dataset, with patients in the everolimus arm and patients in the 
placebo arm after they switched to everolimus. Demographic covariate (age, body surface area, Race, 
Gender) effects on everolimus effect parameters were assessed. Finally, daily Cmin concentration at the 
time of seizure recording was predicted for all patients after first everolimus administration based on the 
population PK model described previously and the dose and time of dose as reported during the study. 
Model simulation and fitting were performed in Monolix Suite 2016R1 on the Novartis MODESIM high 
performance computing environment accessing data from the GPSII system. Model fitting was conducted 
using the SAEM algorithm of Monolix. Matlab 2012a was used for simulations. 
The final selected model was an Emax effect model where the maximal value of the effect increased to a 
maximal value of 1 following an exponential equation. This asymptotic exponential equation was driven 
by the time since the first everolimus administration and an estimated parameter describing the log-slope 
of Emax increase. 
Covariate model 
Sex, age, BSA and race effects were tested in a forward-selection process. The only factor deemed to 
influence significantly the baseline was the age at start of screening, where children tended to experience 
more seizures than adults. The model also identified an effect of age on the everolimus effect. Time to 
reach everolimus maximal effect was predicted to increase with increasing age; everolimus, therefore, 
should attain its maximal effect faster in children than in adults. 
A change in age from the median value of 10.1 years to 6 or 18 years would modify the half-life of 
EmaxEVE,i,d from 122.1 weeks to respectively 70.7 and 224 weeks. Inclusion of a second covariate did 
not improve the model fit. 
The final model was used to explore the relation between the exposure (Cmin) and the predicted 
percentage reduction from baseline in seizure frequency. Percentage change from baseline for each 
patient in study M2304 was predicted using the individual estimates from the final model. Also, the 
predicted proportion of responders for each scenario were computed (>50% reduction from baseline in 
seizure frequency). 
The response rate for patients under placebo is about 30% and increased with the everolimus Cmin 
concentration. With Cmin concentrations above 5 ng/mL, the median expected response rate range from 
30% to 50%: The median proportion of responders is positively correlated with Cmin. The curve depicting 
the median proportion of responders appears approximately piecewise linear, with a steeper slope before 
5 ng/mL, suggesting an advantage to targeting Cmin values of 5 ng/mL or greater. There are responders

EMA/471889/2020 
Page 17/36 
 
 
  
  
patients at low everolimus exposure (Cmin as low as 0.5 ng/mL), while other patients would require 
higher everolimus concentrations or a longer treatment. There were also responders among the patients 
treated with placebo only. A concentration of 3 ng/mL was associated with a slightly lower median 
proportion of responders than 5 ng/mL, but the uncertainty was large. 
Predicted Cmin associated with a 50% reduction from baseline in seizure frequency at 6 months justified 
the target range of 5 to 15 ng/mL in this indication. The results support the use of the everolimus target 
range of 5 – 15 ng/mL given the inter-subject variability observed in the exposure-response relationship 
and the absence of enough safety data for Cmin values above 15 ng/mL. 
Prediction of long-term efficacy 
For prediction of long-term efficacy, two different models (Model A and B) were developed. 
Model A: A multiplicative linear regression model for post-baseline SF was used. In this model, the post-
baseline SF after a fixed time interval (12 weeks) was linked to the time-normalized Cmin over the 12 
weeks intervals, accounting for the longitudinal nature of the data. 
The parameter estimates from this model fitted on the M2304 data first were used to predict post-
baseline TSC-associated refractory seizure frequency in the simulated patient population for ten scenarios 
where the subjects started treatment at 6 months old up to 2 years old and were treated for a period of 2 
years (96 weeks). The model considered log-transformed SF at baseline, the number of days the patient 
was on everolimus treatment and log-transformed time-normalized Cmin as covariates and patient as 
random effect. A random subject effect on the slope of days on everolimus treatment is also included. An 
unstructured covariance structure is assumed for the random effects. 
Assessment report  
EMA/471889/2020 
Page 18/36 
 
 
  
  
 
 
Model B: The exposure-efficacy relationship was explored by a multiplicative linear regression model for 
the ratio of post-baseline and baseline SF (SF/SFB) considering time-normalized Cmin over 12 week 
intervals. The factor “time”, i.e. the number of days the patient was on everolimus treatment and the log-
transformed time-normalized Cmin as covariates and patient as random effect were included in the 
model. An additional random subject effect on the slope of days on everolimus treatment is also included. 
An unstructured covariance structure is assumed for the random effects. 
Both linear mixed models (Model A and Model B) allowed the prediction of postbaseline seizure frequency. 
The Model B results were consistent with the Model A results. Time-normalized Cmin and the time of 
exposure to everolimus were found to influence the long-term efficacy of everolimus in reducing the post-
baseline SF to baseline SF ratio (SF/SFB). The reduction effect on the post-baseline SF to baseline SF 
ratio (SF/SFB) was estimated to be 21.44% (95% CI from 13.36 to 28.77) for every 2-fold increase in 
Cmin and 5.64% (95% CI from 3.54 to 7.70) for every additional 12 weeks on everolimus treatment. 
Exposure-efficacy analyses predicted that TSC patients between 6 months and 2 years old would 
experience a reduction in TSC-associated refractory seizure frequency at both short-term and long-term 
exposures. In fact, this effect could be seen as early as 12 weeks into therapy when patients have 
reached steady state. The predicted median reductions in seizure frequency were in the range of 40% to 
70%, more noticeable among younger patients. These results are higher than the reduction in baseline 
seizure frequency actually observed in study M2304 in adult patients (30% to 40%), which can be 
expected given the higher steady state Cmin observed in patients of 6 months to 2 years of age. 
Additionally, PopPD models included an age effect, leading to a quicker response in children. From the 
long-term efficacy analysis based on the M2304 data, seizure control was assumed to improve with 
continued therapy with everolimus, and thus increased reductions in seizure frequency were predicted 
with continued exposure for up to 2 years (96 weeks). 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
A PBPK model has been developed with the available adult data and has been refined for paediatric 
patients. This model is intended to be used to predict PK parameters in children aged 6 months to 1 year. 
PBPK modelling incorporates age-related differences in demographics, physiology, and ontogeny of 
clearance pathways. Since everolimus is mainly metabolized by CYP3A4, CYP3A ontogeny was 
implemented in the model according to a recent publication (Upreti and Wahlstrom, 2016). Nevertheless, 
CYP3A ontogeny during the time between 6 months and 1 year is very steep, thus bearing high 
uncertainty when predicting Cmin concentrations. Due to the high uncertainty it is not considered possible 
to reliably reach the necessary specific target range of Cmin concentrations with this model. 
In addition, the PBPK model was used to generate Cmin concentrations for children aged 1-2 years to be 
used as input for exposure-response modelling. With the currently developed model it remains unclear 
whether the Cmin concentrations are adequately predicted. 
It was agreed that section 5.2 of the SmPC should reflect that in patients with TSC and refractory 
seizures, Votubia concentrations were investigated in n=9 patients in the age between 1 and<2 years. 
Doses of 6 mg/m2 (absolute doses range 1-5 mg) were administered and resulted in minimal 
concentrations between 2 and 10 ng/ml (median of 5 ng/mL; total of >50 measurements). No data are 
available in patients with TSC-seizures below the age of 1 year. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The currently presented PBPK model is not considered adequate to generate valid PK parameters in 
patients aged 6 months to 1 year and Cmin concentrations in patients aged 1 to 2 years in order to be 
Assessment report  
EMA/471889/2020 
Page 19/36 
 
 
  
  
used as input to subsequent exposure-response models. Nevertheless, addition of relevant information on 
concentration data generated in children aged 1-2 years to section 5.2 of the SmPC was agreed. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
No clinical studies evaluating efficacy of everolimus for treatment of POS in TSC patients aged 6 month to 
2 years are available. Efficacy in this indication is intended to be extrapolated from children above 2 years 
of age and adults (source population) to patients aged 6 months to 2 years (target population) via 
modelling and simulation exercises based on previously submitted TSC studies. As shown in Table 1, 
above, study M2304 results were modelled to predict efficacy of everolimus in patients aged 6 month to 
below 2 years with TSC associated POS.  In addition to study M2304, studies M2301 (the pivotal study in 
TSC patients with SEGA, which included paediatric and adult patients, including overall 10 patients 
between the age of 1 and 2 years) and M2302 (the pivotal study in adult patients with renal 
angiomyolipoma) were used to develop the PBPK model. 
For further assessment of the PBPK modelling, population PD modelling as well as the linear mixed effect 
modelling, please refer to Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics sections of this report (sections 2.3.2 
and 2.3.3., above). 
Justification for extrapolation of efficacy 
The following information regarding TSC associated refractory partial onset seizures (POS) in the target 
population was presented in the submitted Clinical overview. The main argument presented by the 
applicant in the Clinical overview in support of extrapolation of efficacy is that due to the common 
aetiology of TSC-refractory POS and presence of the same targets in patients between 6 months and 2 
years of age, everolimus is expected to be effective and safe in this target population as it has been 
demonstrated in patients older than 2 years of age. 
In addition, further information is given in the Bridging Concept: 
In a Massachusetts General Hospital retrospective study that included all children and adults with TSC 
seen between Jan-2002 and Oct-2008 (291 patients), the most common seizures observed were complex 
partial seizures (86.9%, including those with secondary generalization) and infantile spasms (46.4%). 
The onset of seizures typically occurs in the first year of life (with 63% within 1 year of age and 82% 
before 3 years of age); however, adults remain at risk and up to 12% of adult patients with TSC develop 
epilepsy as adults, indicating that TSC patients are at an increased risk of epilepsy throughout their 
lifetime (Chu-Shore et al., 2010). No report on noteworthy differences in POS types between age groups 
has been found. 
According to the Bridging Concept, treatment of POS in TSC is similar to POS resulting from other causes 
and TSC-seizures might respond to AEDs indicated for POS (such as topiramate, lamotrigine, 
levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, and vigabatrin). The guidelines for AED treatment are generally the same 
for children and adults, i.e., the AED strategy should be individualized according to seizure type, epilepsy 
syndrome, co-medication and co-morbidity (Krueger and Northrup 2013). 
Efficacy in source population: 
Everolimus has been approved for treatment of TSC associated POS in patients aged ≥ 2 years based on 
one pivotal study (M2304). Study M2304 was a double-blind, randomized, multi-centre, Phase III trial 
evaluating the efficacy and safety of two different target trough ranges of everolimus in patients (aged 1 
to 65 years in Europe, and 2 to 65 years for the rest of the world) who have refractory TSC-associated 
POS while being on a stable regimen of 1 to 3 AEDs.  
Assessment report  
EMA/471889/2020 
Page 20/36 
 
 
  
  
 
The design, including the choice endpoints, was generally in line with the recommendations of the CHMP 
guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of epileptic disorders 
(CHMP/EWP/566/98Rev.2/Corr) on confirmatory studies in adjunctive treatment of refractory seizures. 
Short-term efficacy: 
During the 12 week maintenance period of the core phase, Study M2304 demonstrated superiority of 
everolimus at two target through ranges (LT: 3 to 7 ng/mL and HT: 9 to 15 ng/mL) over placebo in 
reducing the frequency of TSC seizures in both paediatric and adult patients with refractory epilepsy. 
Statistically significantly higher 50% responder rates (difference to placebo: 13.1% and 24.9% for LT and 
HT, respectively) as well as percent reduction in weekly TSC seizure frequency from baseline (difference 
to placebo: 16% and 27.5% for LT and HT, respectively) were found for both tested everolimus groups 
compared to placebo. Median percent reduction in weekly seizure frequency was 29.3% (95% CI: 18.8, 
41.9) and 39.6% (95% CI: 35.0, 48.7) for the everolimus LT and HT arms, respectively, compared with 
14.9% (95% CI: 0.1, 21.7) for the placebo arm. The magnitude of effect as measured by both endpoints 
was considered clinically relevant, in particular taking into consideration that the study population was 
highly refractory with a high baseline seizure frequency and several previous failed AED regimens. 
Long-term efficacy:  
Reduction in seizure frequency was sustained over an evaluation period of approximately 2 years, during 
which all patients received everolimus. Based on a sensitivity analysis considering patients who 
prematurely discontinued everolimus as non-responders, response rates of 38.4% (95% CI: 33.4, 43.7) 
and 44.4% (95% CI: 38.2, 50.7) were observed after 1 and 2 years of exposure to everolimus, 
respectively. 
Subgroup analyses by age showed higher response rates and increased reductions in seizure frequency 
for both everolimus treatment groups relative to placebo for all age categories (<6 years, 6 to <12 years, 
12 to <18 years, and ≥ 18 years). Seizure frequency at the end of the core phase appeared markedly 
reduced within the lowest age category (2-5 years). Further analyses within the 2-5 year age category 
showed that a reasonable proportion of subjects was actually 2 years and 3 years old. 
Study M2304 was used to build the popPK and popPD model as well as the linear mixed model, which 
were developed in order to predict the short-term efficacy and long-term efficacy, respectively of 
everolimus in the target population aged 6 months to below 24 months of age. 
Modelling and simulation-based predictions of efficacy in target population 
Predictions of short-term efficacy: 
Reduction in seizure frequency (SF) 
The popPD model predicted a substantial reduction in SF among paediatric patients at the predicted 
Cmin. The median predicted percentage reduction in SF was at least 64.2% (5th quantile; 95th quantile: 
46.1%; 74.9%) at 24 weeks from the start of everolimus treatment, which was found for patients aged 
22 months at the start of treatment. The predicted highest reduction in SF was 77.8% (5th quantile; 95th 
quantile: 60.6%; 87.6%), at 24 weeks from the start of everolimus treatment, which was found for 
patients aged 6 months at the start of treatment. 
Percentage responders 
The predicted median responder rate at the predicted 24-week Cmin was at least 57.5% (5th quantile; 
95th quantile: 52%; 64%) and was found for patients who started everolimus at 22 months. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/471889/2020 
Page 21/36 
 
 
  
  
 
predicted highest responder rate was 67.5% (5th quantile; 95th quantile: 61.5%; 72.5%) at 24 weeks 
and found for patients who started everolimus at 6 months of age. 
Predictions of long-term efficacy: 
Based on the long-term model-based analysis, the reduction in SF observed in study M2304 was 21.39% 
(95% confidence interval [CI]: 13.30-28.74) for a 2-fold increase in time-normalized Cmin. Every 
additional 12 weeks of exposure to everolimus was predicted to have a modest, but significant effect on 
SF, resulting in a further decrease of SF by 5.64% (95% CI: 3.54-7.70) per period. Additionally, a 0.5-
fold reduction in baseline SF was predicted to reduce SF by 49.41% (95% CI: 45.68-52.89).  
The proposed dosing recommendations for the target population remain the same as those approved for 
children aged 2 to < 6 years of age: 
Therapeutic drug monitoring to maintain Cmin within a target concentration range is recommended for 
patients with TSC seizures to accommodate for the wide range of body sizes among infants and adults 
and the co-administration of CYP3A4 iso-enzyme inducers. 
The recommended target Cmin exposure range is 5 to 15 ng/mL, based on data of seizure response and 
overall safety observable across this range. The recommended starting doses for patients <6 years of age 
is 6 mg/m2 when administered without CYP3A4/PgP inducer and 9 mg/m2 when administered with 
CYP3A4/PgP inducer. In addition, a flexible titration dose scheme of 1 to 4 mg is also recommended, 
which could potentially reduce the dose titration steps to attain the Cmin within the target Cmin range. 
2.4.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
No clinical studies evaluating efficacy of everolimus for treatment of POS in TSC patients aged 6 month to 
< 2 years are available. Efficacy in this indication is intended to be extrapolated from children above 2 
years of age and adults (source population) to patients aged 6 months to 2 years (target population) via 
modelling and simulation exercises based on previously submitted TSC studies.  
Everolimus has been approved for treatment of refractory TSC associated POS in patients aged ≥ 2 years 
based on one pivotal study (M2304), which was now used to predict efficacy in the target population. The 
predicted (short-term) median reductions in seizure frequency were in the range of 40-70% compared to 
the actual median reduction in frequency of 30% in the low trough and 40% in the high trough dose 
group resulting from study M2304. Results of the linear mixed effect models also predicted maintenance 
of effect. However, there are shortcomings of the modelling and simulation approach indicating that the 
current model is not fit for its purpose, which is detailed in section 2.3 of this report. 
Justification of extrapolation  
The Applicant claims that the common aetiology of TSC and targeted mechanism of action of everolimus 
support the extrapolation of data from patients aged ≥ 2 years to patients aged 6 months-<2 years.  
This is agreed insofar, as the over-activated mTOR signalling may be considered the general underlying 
aetiology of TSC while the general mechanism of action of everolimus is exerted via selective mTOR 
inhibition. However, besides pathological changes in brain tissue (such as cortical tubers) which may 
cause seizures, the dysregulation of the mTOR pathway is also considered to be directly implicated in the 
pathogenesis of epilepsy in TSC. Likewise, the exact mechanism of antiepileptic action of everolimus is 
not yet clear, and both, a reduction in pathological changes in brain tissue (which has been shown with 
Assessment report  
EMA/471889/2020 
Page 22/36 
 
 
  
  
regard to SEGA) as well as direct reduction of hyper-excitability/seizure activity by inhibiting the 
hyperactive mTOR signalling may play a role.  
However, structural brain lesions as epileptogenic foci may change with age, e.g. SEGA, which may lead 
to increase in seizure frequency or occurrence of new seizures, slowly arise over time during the first two 
decades of life.  
It is currently unclear to what extent pathophysiology (POS aetiology) and mode of action may differ 
dependent on age and to what extent these factors may modify efficacy of everolimus between source 
and target population.  
Further, two major assumptions underlie the bridging concept, i.e. that source and target population are 
similar with regard to: 
1) the frequency, type and severity of (POS) seizures (including only rare emergency of new seizure 
types) and 
2) a similar and stable concomitant AED treatment regime. 
The validity of these assumptions is questioned.  
Extrapolability of the exposure-response relationship in the approved TSC seizure indication from patients 
aged ≥ 2 years to patients aged 6 months to < 2 years is currently not adequately justified. 
The Applicant finally agreed not to amend the currently approved indication but to update information 
relevant to the paediatric population in sections 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC. 
2.4.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy of everolimus in the treatment of refractory TSC associated POS in patients aged 6 months to < 2 
years can at present not be concluded as extrapolation of the exposure-response relationship in the 
approved TSC seizure indication from patients aged ≥ 2 years to patients aged 6 months to < 2 years is 
not adequately justified. As a result, the Applicant agreed not to amend the currently approved indication 
but to update information relevant to the paediatric population in sections 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
No new CSR has been submitted within this procedure. 
Safety data in the target population (6 months to 2 years of age) are derived from the Novartis global 
safety database (ARGUS), including cases from previously conducted studies within TSC-related 
indications, and from literature articles. 
Patient exposure 
Definitions of ‘key safety population’ and evaluations performed 
The target safety population for the purpose of the CO (explicitly the ‘CO in patients 6 months to 2 years 
of age with refractory seizures associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)’) are the patients 
between 6 months to <2 years of age (referred to thereafter as ‘Target age group’), for the adjunctive 
treatment of POS with or without secondary generalization, associated with TSC (oncology patients were

not included in this study). Since no specific study is available, a search was conducted in the ARGUS 
safety database and a comparison of safety data was made between the target age group and the closest 
age group, i.e., children in the age group of 2 to <12 year-old (referred to thereafter as the ‘Reference 
age group’). The age range of 2 to <12 year-old was used to get sufficient data as opposed to a narrower 
age range (e.g. 2 to 6 year-old) and to have comparable patients in terms of safety (which might not be 
the case for children older than 12 year-old). 
Only children treated for TSC were included in both groups. No additional filtering on POS status was 
done since it was not systematically reported and only 4 patients in the target age group had an 
indication of TSC related seizures. Except seizure-related events, it is not expected that everolimus safety 
profile would be different in TSC patients with POS compared to those without POS. 
The following sources have been used: 
• 
• 
Individual Case Safety Reports (ARGUS) 
Published scientific literature 
•  Official safety database (World Health Organization and AERS) 
ARGUS was searched based on the patient’s reported age or age group without any restriction in 
preferred terms. MedDRA version 22.0 was used for this search. 
Exposure (in the ‘key safety population’) 
Sales data for specific age groups was not available and hence the drug exposure could not be calculated 
for the target or the reference age groups. The estimated cumulative post-marketing (non-clinical trial) 
exposure values in patient years (PTY) is 23,522. This is the total patient exposure in TSC setting till date 
from post marketing experience across all age groups (cutoff date 31-Mar-2019). The available clinical 
trial exposure data in the paediatric age group is presented below:

Adverse events 
A cumulative search of ARGUS was conducted with a cutoff date of 12-Apr-2019, for adverse events with 
everolimus use in the target and reference age groups in the TSC indication. 
The ARGUS search retrieved 1,314 cases with 4,809 events. The distribution of these cases between the 
two age groups is detailed in Table 5-2.

AEs reported in both the target and reference age groups by system organ class (SOC) as well as the 
reporting ratios are summarized in Table 5-3 and presented visually in Figure 5-1. All cases are in the 
TSC indication. 
Reporting ratios (RR) are defined as the number of events reported for the PT divided by the total 
number of events reported for the age group. The proportional reporting ratios (PRR) correspond to the 
RR for the target population divided by the RR for the reference population.

The 278 events reported in the target age group, 92 (including 53 serious) were assessed as related to 
everolimus therapy by either the reporter or the MAH. Out of the 4531 events reported in the reference 
group, 1503 (including 1038 serious) were assessed as related to everolimus therapy by either the 
reporter or the MAH. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
A comparison of serious and non-serious cases does not show remarkable differences in terms of PRR 
between the target and reference age groups (Table 5-5).

The single fatal case in the target age group was a one-year old male child who died 3 days after 
initiation of everolimus treatment. At initiation of everolimus, the patient's neurological condition was 
very compromised including complete paralysis of the pharyngeal region, complicated with an inhalation 
pneumonitis, disturbances of consciousness with agitation, stupor, obnubilation, increase of left facial 
paralysis, absence of communication and obvious neurovegetative disorders (episodes of tachycardia, 
multifactorial fever). The subject died three days after initiation of everolimus, the cause of death 
according to death certificate was disease progression. No causality was suspected to everolimus 
treatment by the reporter or by the MAH. The cause of death in the 17 cases in reference group were 
reported as glioma (n=3), malignant neoplasm progression (3), general physical health deterioration (2), 
neoplasm progression (2), sudden unexplained death in epilepsy (2), respiratory distress (1), pneumonia 
(1), dyspnoea (1), disease progression (1), death (1), neurological decompensation (1), brain 
oedema(1), pneumonia aspiration (1), seizure (1),respiratory tract congestion (1), somnolence (1), 
depressed level of consciousness (1), cardio-respiratory arrest, syncope (1), asphyxia (1). 
Post marketing experience 
The analyses based on the ARGUS Individual Case Safety Reports are considered as post-marketing 
experience but presented in the previous sections.  
In addition to the analysis of the ARGUS data the MAH reports on post marketing experiences as follows: 
Global external data and literature reports 
Literature reports are in line with the ARGUS-reported data, and overall indicate that everolimus is well-
tolerated. 
In FDA AERS and WHO Vigibase databases as of 27-May-2019 in the age group of 0-23 months, the 
events with higher disproportionality scores (EB05 more than equal to 2) were similar to those reported 
in other age population (majority of these events are also listed for everolimus). All of these cases are 
from patients treated with everolimus.

In two separate studies, infants between 0 to 2 years of age were treated with everolimus for TSC, SEGA, 
refractory epilepsy, or related syndromes (Saffari et al 2019 and Krueger et al 2018). This included a 
total of 62 patients in the target age group. In both studies, most of the AEs were grade 1 or 2 in 
severity. Grade 3 AEs were reported in one study (7/45) (Krueger et al 2018); none of the studies 
reported any grade 4 or 5 (disability/death) events. Nine (out of 45) patients in one study discontinued 
due to AEs. Taken overall, the most common AEs in both studies were infections (or recurrent infections). 
This is similar to the observations from Novartis databases, which also showed that infections and 
infestations were the most frequently observed SOCs in the target population (Saffari et al 2019, Krueger 
et al 2018). 
Two other studies in infants less than 12 months of age indicate similar results. Five patients received 
everolimus for SEGA and 4 patients for TSC-associated West Syndrome. Most of the AEs in both studies 
were low grade in severity (Samueli et al 2018, Kuki et al 2018). Grade 4 events (extensive impetigo 
contagiosa and recurrent pharyngitis) were reported in one study, that resolved after dose interruption 
(Samueli et al 2018). 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety in patients with TSC-associated refractory seizures is well-characterized, in paediatric patients 2 
years of age and above. 
Overall, no major difference in terms of reporting ratios emerges from the presented comparison. The 
high PRR (>2) for cardiac disorders (2 events of “minimal cardiac effusion” both in a context of viral 
infection), and hepato-biliary disorders (1 event) is mainly due to the low number of events in the target 
group; for injury, poisoning and procedural complications, 10 events of product use in unapproved 
indication and 4 of off-label use were reported that account for the difference in PRR (if these 14 events 
are removed from the computations, the PRR reduces from 2.54 to 1.35 (5.65%/4.18%)). 
The overall profile of AEs by PT was similar in both age groups (6 months to <2 years and >2 years). 
PTs with a higher reporting ratio in the target age group (more than twice that of the reference age 
group) are discussed below: 
•  Otitis media, infection, pharyngitis, respiratory tract infection that can be explained by a 
higher sensitivity to infections in this age group 
• 
Focal dyscognitive seizures and epilepsy reflect the underlying TSC. However, the 
absolute number of cases are low in the target age group; therefore, it is not possible to 
draw any conclusions. 
•  Hypertriglyceridemia and increased blood triglycerides are listed events that were all non-
serious except for one case (medically significant as per reporter) in a 22-months old 
patient with a family history of hypertriglyceridemia. However, the absolute number of 
cases are low in the target age group; therefore, it is not possible to draw any 
conclusions.  
• 
Three cases of drug interaction were reported: in one case of interaction with 
oxcarbazepine, everolimus level fluctuations were associated with recurrence of seizures, 
in another case of interaction with phenytoin and phenobarbital, no clinical events were 
reported and in the last case of interaction with voriconazole non-serious liver disorder 
was reported concomitantly with the interaction and abated after everolimus blood levels 
had decreased following dose adjustment. Three non-serious cases of drug ineffective 
were also reported for the target age group.

Note: ‘Product use issue’, ‘Product use in unapproved indication’, ‘Wrong technique in product usage 
process’ and ‘Off label use’ were reported with a higher reporting ratio in the target age group relative to 
the reference age group. This observation could suggest various situations, including the use in a 
population for which everolimus is not approved. 
The patients included in the safety database could have received different doses of everolimus. However, 
the impact is expected to be minimal, considering that treatment with everolimus is titrated to target 
trough plasma levels between 5 to 15 ng/mL. 
A review of the individual case safety reports from the Novartis Safety database in the target age group 
of children between 6 months and 2 years of age did not present any potential new safety signal. The 
analysis neither presented a pattern of data that could indicate a change in characteristic of a known 
safety issue, nor warranted a follow up on specific safety topics. With the limited post-marketing data 
available in the target age group for review, there was no safety information that could impact the safety 
profile of everolimus for this population. Based on post marketing safety data, evaluation of the safety 
profile of everolimus in the target age group appears to be consistent with that of the population for 
which everolimus is currently approved. 
The safety experiences with everolimus presented do not refer to the treatment of seizurers in children 
with TSC below the age of 2 years (There were no cases reported in Novartis safety database where the 
indication for use of everolimus was seizure associated with TSC in the target age group of 6 months – 2 
years.). 
In conclusion, the presented analysis could not show any meaningful difference between the target and 
reference age groups with respect to the nature of reported events, their seriousness, or their outcome. 
In addition, section 4.8 of the current SmPC is already pooling data across different TSC indications (i.e. 
pivotal phase II and III trials). These data are limited to patients older than 1 year of age. In essence, 
considering that from a safety perspective pooling of data of patients with AML, POS and SEGA is 
considered acceptable by CHMP, the remaining safety question not addressed by section 4.8 of the SmPC, 
and by the Novartis Safety database in the target age group of children between 6 months and 2 years, is 
the safety of everolimus in the age 6 months to 1 year (for which no pre- and post-marketing data are 
reported). However, the scope of this application was revised and only information relevant to the 
paediatric population in sections 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC was updated. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The CHMP considers safety in paediatric patients with TSC 1 years of age and above to be well-
characterized. An extrapolation of clinical safety in TSC-associated refractory seizures to TSC-associated 
SEGA (or TSC in more general) is considered meaningful. 
There are no safety data available to support the use of everolimus in the age range 6 months to 1 
year. The Applicant finally agreed not to amend the currently approved indication but proposed to update 
relevant information in sections 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

2.6.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this variation, sections 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated: 
Section 4.2: 
The safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic profile of Votubia has not been established in children below the 
age of 2 years with TSC and refractory seizures have not been established. Currently available data are 
described in section 5.2, but no recommendation on a posology can be made. No data are available (see 
sections 5.1 and 5.2). 
Section 5.1: 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with Votubia 
in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in refractory epilepsy associated with tuberous 
sclerosis complex (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). The marketing authorisation holder 
has completed the Paediatric Investigation Plan for Votubia for refractory seizures associated with TSC. 
This summary of product characteristics has been updated to include the results of studies with Votubia in 
the paediatric population (see section 5.2). 
Section 5.2: 
In patients with TSC and refractory seizures Votubia concentrations were investigated in 9 patients in the 
age between 1 and<2 years. Doses of 6 mg/m2 (absolute doses range 1-5 mg) were administered and 
resulted in minimal concentrations between 2 and 10 ng/ml (median of 5 ng/mL; total of >50 
measurements). No data are available in patients with TSC-seizures below the age of 1 year.  
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template, SmPC 
guideline and other relevant guideline(s). 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
This variation was submitted in order to modify the approved therapeutic indication, adjunctive treatment 
of patients aged 2 years and older whose refractory partial-onset seizures, with or without secondary 
generalisation, are associated with tuberous sclerosis complex, to include the new population of patients 
from 6 months to less than 2 years of age. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Seizures associated with TSC are treated with antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) or methods such as epilepsy 
surgery, vagal nerve stimulator or ketogenic diet (Jobst 2009; Wong 2010). Other than for infantile 
spasms in TSC for which vigabatrin is usually recommended as first line treatment, there is little evidence 
to guide effective anticonvulsant treatment. The published literature suggests that TSC-associated POS 
may respond to one or several AEDs approved for the treatment of POS, e.g. topiramate, lamotrigine, 
levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, and clobazam. The prevalence of medically refractory epilepsy in TSC even

Page 32/36 
 
 
  
  
 
with adequate trials of currently available anticonvulsant medications has been reported as high at 
approximately 60%. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
No clinical studies evaluating efficacy of everolimus for treatment of POS in TSC patients aged 6 month to 
< 2 years were submitted. This application is based on a physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) 
model and a population pharmacokinetic model (popPK). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The Applicant intended to extrapolate efficacy in this indication from children above 2 years of age and 
adults (source population) to patients aged 6 months to 2 years (target population) via modelling and 
simulation exercises based on previously submitted TSC studies. Everolimus has been approved for 
treatment of refractory TSC associated POS in patients aged ≥ 2 years based on one pivotal study 
(M2304), which was intended to be used to predict efficacy in the target population. The predicted (short-
term) median reductions in seizure frequency were in the range of 40-70% compared to the actual 
median reduction in frequency of 30% in the low trough and 40% in the high trough dose group resulting 
from study M2304. Results of the linear mixed effect models also predicted maintenance of effect. The 
exposure-response model is based on exposure parameters derived from the PBPK model. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Extrapolation of exposure-response relationship of everolimus in the TSC-associated POS indication from 
patients aged ≥ 2 years (source population) down to patients aged 6 months of age (target population) 
was not convincingly justified by the Applicant.  
There finally remains uncertainty as to what extent brain maturation impacts the disease and the 
treatment response in children younger than 2 years of age. Taking further into account that everolimus 
is not a “standard” AED but a substance considered to affect epileptogenesis, generation of clinical data in 
the target population in order to provide reassurance that a clinically meaningful treatment response with 
regard to TSC associated POS can be achieved in children below 2 years of age was considered 
necessary. The Applicant argued that the conduct of a confirmatory epilepsy study in TSC subjects of the 
targeted age range is challenging and would not be possible. This is acknowledged. However, general 
infeasibility to generate at least some clinical treatment data on seizure frequency in TSC subjects below 
the age of two years is not considered plausible. 
Further, there are two major assumptions underlying the bridging concept, i.e., that source and target 
population are similar with regard to 1st) the frequency, type and severity of (POS) seizures (including 
only rare emergence of new seizure types) and 2nd) a similar and stable concomitant AED treatment 
regime.  
Regarding the 1st assumption, little information regarding POS seizure characteristics in the target 
population is available.  There is some indication though, that seizure frequency in the target population 
may be higher compared to the source population. Within the source population, POS frequency was 
higher with younger age in study M2304 and baseline seizure frequency was a statistically significant 
factor in the exposure-efficacy models of study M2304. Further, there are age-related differences 
regarding the overall seizure characteristics, as the age related seizure type of infantile spasms often co-
occurs or may be even the predominant seizure type in the target population, particularly in the youngest 
age group below 1 year of age.  
Assessment report  
EMA/471889/2020 
Page 33/36 
 
 
  
  
A discussion including respective evaluations of M2304 study results, in how far potential differences with 
regard to subtype, frequency and severity of POS could be expected to not essentially influence efficacy 
of everolimus in the target population has not been provided. 
Regarding the 2nd assumption, the differences in the concomitant AED regimens appear mainly related to 
the more frequent use of vigabatrin and ACTH/corticosteroids in TSC subjects below < 2 years of age.  
From an efficacy point of view, there are remaining uncertainties regarding a potential pharmacokinetic 
interaction of everolimus with corticosteroids and no data on the impact of concomitant use on seizure 
reduction is available. Furthermore, no data on concomitant use of everolimus and vigabatrin has been 
presented; however, a pharmacokinetic interaction with vigabatrin is considered unlikely. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Unfavourable effects, based on CSRs, of everolimus in patients age 1 to 2 years are, although limited, 
entirely described in section 4.8 of the SmPC of the product. No new safety data deriving from CSRs have 
been generated for the scope of this variation II/61. The post-marketing safety data made available 
within this procedure do not add relevant new information for the mentioned age group. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
For the age group 6 months to 1 year, no safety information at all is available. In addition, no safety data 
(including post-marketing data) for the age group 1 to 2 years are available for the treatment of (TSC 
associated) seizures with everolimus.  
Extrapolation of safety data from patients ≥ 2 years of age to the delicate age group of infants (up to the 
first year of life) in the absence of any PK or safety data in the latter is considered problematic. 
3.6.  Effects Table 
No new clinical data were submitted. 
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Efficacy of everolimus in the treatment of refractory TSC associated POS in patients aged 6 months to < 2 
years can at present not be concluded as extrapolation of the exposure-response relationship in the 
approved TSC seizure indication from patients aged ≥ 2 years to patients aged 6 months to < 2 years has 
not been adequately justified. Additional evaluation, in how far differences between source and target 
population with regard to the two major assumptions underlying the bridging concept may modify the 
predicted treatment effect was not provided. Further, the Applicant did not make a proposal for a clinical 
study in order to provide reassurance that a clinically meaningful treatment response can be achieved in 
patients < 2years with regard to TSC associated POS. 
Safety data in the treatment of TSC associated with AML, POS, and/or SEGA can reasonably be pooled, 
which was already concluded by the CHMP and is implemented in section 4.8 of the SmPC accordingly.  
No (pre- or post-marketing) safety data in the group of patients younger than 1 year are available for the 
overall, pooled safety TSC population. In the specific POS TSC population, the MAH is no longer claiming 
a positive B/R in children younger than 2 years of age.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Efficacy of everolimus in the treatment of refractory TSC associated POS in patients aged 6 months to < 2 
years cannot be concluded currently. Safety data in patients with TSC aged > 1 year are available. In the 
overall TSC population, safety of everolimus can be concluded for this age group based on the data 
presented (and reported in the SmPC). However, in the specific POS TSC population, there are no safety 
data for children below the age of 2. Therefore, the balance of benefits and risks in the proposed age 
group 6 months to < 2 years can currently not be assessed in TSC patients treated for seizures. 
Because of the CHMP’s concern with the provided extrapolation approach, the Applicant agreed not to 
amend the currently approved TSC-seizure indication.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
As the extrapolation of exposure-response from source to target population has not been sufficiently 
justified, no information regarding the reduction in TSC associated refractory seizure frequency as 
predicted by the modelling was included in section 5.1 of the SmPC. Further, the PBPK model is not 
considered appropriate to predict exposure outside the investigated range. Nevertheless, addition of 
relevant information on concentration data generated in children aged 1-2 years to section 5.2 of the 
SmPC was agreed. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Votubia is positive.

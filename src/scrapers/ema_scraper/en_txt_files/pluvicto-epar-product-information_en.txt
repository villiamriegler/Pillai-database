1. 
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
Pluvicto 1 000 MBq/mL solution for injection/infusion 
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
One mL of solution contains 1 000 MBq of lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan at the date and time 
of calibration. 
The total amount of radioactivity per single-dose vial is 7 400 MBq ± 10% at the date and time of 
administration. Given the fixed volumetric activity of 1 000 MBq/mL at the date and time of 
calibration, the volume of the solution in the vial can range from 7.5 mL to 12.5 mL in order to 
provide the required amount of radioactivity at the date and time of administration. 
Physical characteristics 
Lutetium-177 decays to a stable hafnium-177 with a physical half-life of 6.647 days by emitting 
beta-minus radiation with a maximum energy of 0.498 MeV (79%) and photon radiation (γ) of 
0.208 MeV (11%) and 0.113 MeV (6.4%). 
Excipient with known effect 
Each mL of solution contains up to 0.312 mmol (7.1 mg) of sodium. Each vial contains up to 
88.75 mg of sodium.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Pluvicto in combination with androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) with or without androgen receptor 
(AR) pathway inhibition is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with progressive 
prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA)-positive metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer 
(mCRPC) who have been treated with AR pathway inhibition and taxane-based chemotherapy (see 
section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Important safety instructions 
Pluvicto should be administered only by persons authorised to handle radiopharmaceuticals in 
designated clinical settings (see section 6.6) and after evaluation of the patient by a qualified 
physician. 
Radiopharmaceuticals, including Pluvicto, should be used by or under the control of healthcare 
professionals who are qualified by specific training and experience in the safe use and handling of 
radiopharmaceuticals, and whose experience and training have been approved by the appropriate 
governmental agency authorised to license the use of radiopharmaceuticals. 
Patient identification 
Patients should be identified for treatment by PSMA imaging. 
Posology 
The recommended treatment regimen of Pluvicto is 7 400 MBq intravenously every 6 weeks 
(±1 week) for up to a total of 6 doses, unless there is disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Medical castration with a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogue should be continued 
during treatment in patients not surgically castrated. 
Treatment monitoring 
Laboratory tests should be performed before and during treatment with Pluvicto. Dosing may need to 
be modified based on the test results (see Table 1).

Dose modifications for adverse reactions 
Recommended dose modifications of Pluvicto for adverse reactions are provided in Table 1. 
Management of severe or intolerable adverse reactions may require temporary dose interruption 
(extending the dosing interval by 4 weeks from 6 weeks up to 10 weeks), dose reduction or permanent 
discontinuation of treatment with Pluvicto. If a treatment delay due to an adverse reaction persists for 
>4 weeks, treatment with Pluvicto must be discontinued. The dose of Pluvicto may be reduced by 20% 
once; the dose should not be re-escalated. If a patient has further adverse reactions that would require 
an additional dose reduction, treatment with Pluvicto must be discontinued.

Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is recommended in patients aged 65 years or older. 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment with 
baseline CLcr ≥50 mL/min by Cockcroft-Gault. Treatment with Pluvicto is not recommended in 
patients with moderate to severe renal impairment with baseline CLcr <50 mL/min or end-stage renal 
disease as the pharmacokinetic profile and safety of Pluvicto have not been studied in these patients 
(see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment. Pluvicto has not been 
studied in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Pluvicto in the paediatric population in the indication of treatment of 
PSMA-expressing prostate cancer. 
Method of administration 
Pluvicto is a ready-to-use solution for injection/infusion for single use only. 
Administration instructions 
The recommended dose of Pluvicto may be administered intravenously as an injection using a 
disposable syringe fitted with a syringe shield (with or without a syringe pump), as an infusion using 
the gravity method (with or without an infusion pump), or as an infusion using the vial (with a 
peristaltic infusion pump). 
A reduced dose of Pluvicto should be administered using the syringe method (with or without a 
syringe pump) or the vial method (with a peristaltic infusion pump). Using the gravity method to 
administer a reduced dose of Pluvicto is not recommended since it may result in delivery of the 
incorrect volume of Pluvicto if the dose is not adjusted prior to administration. 
Prior to administration, flush the intravenous catheter used exclusively for Pluvicto administration 
with ≥10 mL of sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection to ensure patency and 
to minimise the risk of extravasation. Cases of extravasation should be managed as per institutional 
guidelines. Patients should be advised to remain well hydrated and to urinate frequently before and 
after administration of Pluvicto (see section 4.4). 
For instructions on the method of preparation and intravenous methods of administration, see 
section 12. 
For patient preparation, see section 4.4.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Individual benefit/risk justification 
For each patient, the radiation exposure must be justifiable by the likely benefit. The activity 
administered should in every case be as low as reasonably achievable to obtain the required 
therapeutic effect. 
Risk from radiation exposure 
Pluvicto contributes to a patient’s overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure. Long-term 
cumulative radiation exposure is associated with an increased risk for cancer. 
Radiation exposure to patients, medical personnel, and household contacts should be minimised during 
and after treatment with Pluvicto consistent with institutional good radiation safety practices, patient 
management procedures, and instructions to the patient for follow-up radiation protection at home. 
Patient preparation 
Patients should be encouraged to increase oral fluids and urged to void as often as possible to reduce 
bladder radiation, especially after high activities, e.g. for radionuclide therapy. 
After the procedure 
Before the patient is released, the nuclear medicine physician or healthcare professional should explain 
the necessary radioprotection precautions that the patient should follow to minimise radiation exposure 
to others. 
After each administration of Pluvicto, the following general recommendations for patients can be 
considered along with national, local and institutional procedures and regulations. 
• 
Limit close contact (less than 1 metre) with others in their household for 2 days or with children 
and pregnant women for 7 days. 
Refrain from sexual activity for 7 days. 
Sleep in a separate bedroom from others in their household for 3 days, from children for 7 days, 
or from pregnant women for 15 days. 
• 
• 
Myelosuppression 
In the VISION study, myelosuppression, including fatal cases, occurred more frequently in patients 
who received Pluvicto plus best standard of care (BSoC) compared to patients who received BSoC 
alone (see section 4.8). 
Haematology laboratory tests, including haemoglobin, white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil 
count and platelet count, should be performed before and during treatment with Pluvicto. Pluvicto 
should be withheld, dose reduced or permanently discontinued and patients should be clinically 
managed as deemed appropriate based on the severity of myelosuppression (see section 4.2). 
Renal toxicity 
In the VISION study, renal toxicity occurred more frequently in patients who received Pluvicto plus 
BSoC compared to patients who received BSoC alone (see section 4.8). 
Before and after administration of Pluvicto, patients should be encouraged to increase oral fluids and 
urged to void as often as possible, especially after high activities, e.g. for radionuclide therapy. Kidney 
function laboratory tests, including serum creatinine and calculated CLcr, should be performed before 
and during treatment with Pluvicto. Pluvicto should be withheld, dose reduced or permanently 
discontinued based on the severity of renal toxicity (see section 4.2). 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal/Hepatic impairment 
Careful consideration of the benefit risk ratio in these patients is required since an increased radiation 
exposure is possible. 
Exposure (AUC) of lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan is expected to increase with the degree of 
renal impairment (see section 5.2). Patients with mild or moderate renal impairment may be at greater 
risk of toxicity. Renal function and adverse reactions should be frequently monitored in patients with 
mild to moderate renal impairment (see section 4.2). Treatment with Pluvicto is not recommended in 
patients with moderate to severe renal impairment with baseline CLcr <50 mL/min or end-stage renal 
disease. 
Fertility 
Radiations of lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan may potentially have toxic effects on male gonads 
and spermatogenesis. The recommended cumulative dose of 44 400 MBq of Pluvicto results in a 
radiation absorbed dose to the testes within the range where Pluvicto may cause infertility. Genetic 
consultation is recommended if the patient wishes to have children after treatment. Cryopreservation 
of sperm can be discussed as an option for male patients before treatment (see section 4.6). 
Contraception in males 
Male patients are advised not to father a child and to use a condom for intercourse during treatment 
with Pluvicto and for 14 weeks after the last dose (see section 4.6). 
Specific warnings 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains up to 3.9 mmol (88.75 mg) sodium per vial, equivalent to 4.4% of the 
WHO recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
Precautions with respect to environmental hazard see section 6.6. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No clinical drug interaction studies were performed. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Contraception in males 
Because of potential effects on spermatogenesis associated with radiations of lutetium (177Lu) 
vipivotide tetraxetan, male patients are advised not to father a child and to use a condom for 
intercourse during treatment with Pluvicto and for 14 weeks after the last dose (see section 4.4). 
Pregnancy 
Pluvicto is not indicated for use in females. No animal studies using lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide 
tetraxetan have been conducted to evaluate its effect on female reproduction and embryo-foetal 
development. However, all radiopharmaceuticals, including Pluvicto, have the potential to cause foetal 
harm when administered to a pregnant woman.

Breast-feeding 
Pluvicto is not indicated for use in females. There are no data on the presence of lutetium (177Lu) 
vipivotide tetraxetan in human milk or its effects on the breast-fed newborn/infant or on milk 
production. 
Fertility 
No studies were conducted to determine the effects of lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan on 
fertility. Radiations of lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan may potentially have toxic effects on male 
gonads and spermatogenesis. The recommended cumulative dose of 44 400 MBq of Pluvicto results in 
a radiation absorbed dose to the testes within the range where Pluvicto may cause infertility. Genetic 
consultation is recommended if the patient wishes to have children after treatment. Cryopreservation 
of sperm can be discussed as an option for male patients before treatment (see section 4.4). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Pluvicto may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of safety profile 
Unless otherwise stated, the frequency of listed adverse reactions is based on data from the VISION 
study in which 529 patients received at least one dose of 7 400 MBq (median number of doses was 
five). 
The most common adverse reactions include: fatigue (43.1%), dry mouth (39.3%), nausea (35.3%), 
anaemia (31.8%), decreased appetite (21.2%) and constipation (20.2%). The most common grade 3 to

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Myelosuppression 
In the VISION study, myelosuppression occurred more frequently in patients who received Pluvicto 
plus BSoC compared to patients who received BSoC alone (all grades/grade ≥3): anaemia 
(31.8%/12.9%) versus (13.2%/4.9%); thrombocytopenia (17.2%/7.9%) versus (4.4%/1.0%); 
leukopenia (12.5%/2.5%) versus (2.0%/0.5%); lymphopenia (14.2%/7.8%) versus (3.9%/0.5%); 
neutropenia (8.5%/3.4%) versus (1.5%/0.5%); pancytopenia (1.5%/1.1%) versus (0%/0%) including 
two fatal events of pancytopenia in patients who received Pluvicto plus BSoC; and bicytopenia 
(0.2%/0.2%) versus (0%/0%). 
Myelosuppression adverse reactions that led to permanent discontinuation in ≥0.5% of patients who 
received Pluvicto plus BSoC included: anaemia (2.8%), thrombocytopenia (2.8%), leukopenia (1.3%), 
neutropenia (0.8%) and pancytopenia (0.6%). Myelosuppression adverse reactions that led to dose 
interruptions/dose reductions in ≥0.5% of patients who received Pluvicto plus BSoC included: 
anaemia (5.1%/1.3%), thrombocytopenia (3.6%/1.9%), leukopenia (1.5%/0.6%) and neutropenia 
(0.8%/0.6%). 
Renal toxicity 
In the VISION study, renal toxicity occurred more frequently in patients who received Pluvicto plus 
BSoC compared to patients who received BSoC alone (all grades/grades 3 to 4): blood creatinine 
increased (5.3%/0.2%) versus (2.4%/0.5%); acute kidney injury (3.6%/3.0%) versus (3.9%/2.4%); 
renal failure (0.2%/0%) versus (0%/0%); and blood urea increased (0.2%/0%) versus (0%/0%). 
Renal adverse reactions that led to permanent discontinuation in ≥0.2% of patients who received 
Pluvicto plus BSoC included: blood creatinine increased (0.2%). Renal adverse reactions that led to 
dose interruptions/dose reductions in ≥0.2% of patients who received Pluvicto plus BSoC included: 
blood creatinine increased (0.2%/0.4%) and acute kidney injury (0.2%/0%). 
Second primary malignancies 
Exposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of 
hereditary defects. The radiation dose resulting from therapeutic exposure may result in higher 
incidence of cancer and mutations. In all cases it is necessary to ensure that the risks of the radiation 
are less than from the disease itself. As Pluvicto contributes to a patient’s overall long-term radiation 
exposure, which is associated with an increased risk for cancer (see section 4.4), a potential risk of 
second primary malignancies cannot be ruled out for radiopharmaceuticals such as Pluvicto. At the 
time of the VISION primary analysis (cut-off date 27-Jan-2021), cases of squamous cell carcinoma 
(4 patients; 0.8%) and basal cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma and squamous cell carcinoma of the 
skin (1 patient each; 0.2% each) were reported in patients who received Pluvicto plus BSoC. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In the event of administration of a radiation overdose with Pluvicto, the absorbed dose to the patient 
should be reduced where possible by increasing the elimination of the radionuclide from the body by 
frequent micturition or by forced diuresis and frequent bladder voiding. It might be helpful to estimate 
the effective dose that was applied.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals, Other therapeutic 
radiopharmaceuticals, ATC code: V10XX05 
Mechanism of action 
The active moiety of Pluvicto is the radionuclide lutetium-177 which is linked to a small-molecule 
ligand that targets and binds with high affinity to PSMA, a transmembrane protein that is highly 
expressed in prostate cancer, including mCRPC. Upon the binding of Pluvicto to PSMA-expressing 
cancer cells, the beta-minus emission from lutetium-177 delivers therapeutic radiation to the targeted 
cell, as well as to surrounding cells, and induces DNA damage which can lead to cell death. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Unlabelled vipivotide tetraxetan does not have any pharmacodynamic activity. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
VISION 
The efficacy of Pluvicto in patients with progressive, PSMA-positive mCRPC was evaluated in 
VISION, a randomised, multicentre, open-label phase III study. Eight hundred and thirty-one (N=831) 
adult patients were randomised (2:1) to receive either Pluvicto 7 400 MBq every 6 weeks for up to a 
total of 6 doses plus best standard of care (BSoC) (N=551) or BSoC alone (N=280). Patients who 
received 4 doses of Pluvicto were reassessed for evidence of response, signs of residual disease, and 
tolerability and could receive up to 2 additional doses per physician’s discretion. 
To maintain castration status, all patients continued to receive a GnRH analogue or had prior bilateral 
orchiectomy. Eligible patients were required to have progressive, PSMA-positive mCRPC, Eastern 
Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (PS) of 0 to 2, at least one metastatic lesion 
present on computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or bone scan imaging, and 
adequate renal, hepatic and haematological function. 
Eligible patients were also required to have received at least one AR pathway inhibitor, such as 
abiraterone acetate or enzalutamide, and 1 or 2 prior taxane-based chemotherapy regimens (with a 
regimen defined as a minimum exposure of 2 cycles of a taxane). Patients treated with only 1 prior 
taxane-based chemotherapy regimen were eligible if the patient was unwilling or the physician 
deemed the patient unsuitable to receive a second regimen. Patients with unstable symptomatic central 
nervous system metastases or symptomatic or clinically/radiologically impending spinal cord 
compression were not eligible for the study. Patients underwent a gallium (68Ga) gozetotide positron 
emission tomography (PET) scan to evaluate PSMA expression in lesions defined by central read 
criteria. Eligible patients were required to have PSMA-positive mCRPC defined as having at least one 
tumour lesion with gallium (68Ga) gozetotide uptake greater than in normal liver. Patients were 
excluded if any lesions exceeding size criteria in short axis (organs ≥1 cm, lymph nodes ≥2.5 cm, 
bones [soft-tissue component] ≥1 cm) had uptake less than or equal to uptake in normal liver. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
BSoC administered at the physician’s discretion included: supportive measures including pain 
management, hydration, blood transfusions, etc.; ketoconazole; radiation therapy (including seeded 
form or any external beam radiotherapy [including stereotactic body radiotherapy and palliative 
external beam]) to localised prostate cancer targets; bone-targeted agents including zoledronic acid, 
denosumab and any bisphosphonates; androgen-reducing agents including GnRH analogues, any 
corticosteroid, and 5-alpha reductases; AR pathway inhibitors. BSoC excluded investigational agents, 
cytotoxic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, other systemic radioisotopes and hemi-body radiotherapy 
treatment. 
Patients continued randomised treatment until evidence of tumour progression (based on investigator 
assessment per Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 [PCWG3] criteria), unacceptable toxicity, use of 
prohibited treatment, non-compliance or withdrawal, or lack of clinical benefit. 
The primary efficacy endpoints were overall survival (OS) and radiographic progression-free survival 
(rPFS) as determined by blinded independent central review (BICR) per PCWG3 criteria. Among the 
secondary efficacy endpoints were overall response rate (ORR) as determined by BICR per Response 
Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1 and time to first symptomatic skeletal event (SSE) 
defined as first new symptomatic pathological bone fracture, spinal cord compression, tumour-related 
orthopaedic surgical intervention, requirement for radiation therapy to relieve bone pain, or death from 
any cause, whichever occurred first. Radiographic imaging for tumour assessment (CT with 
contrast/MRI imaging and bone scan) was done every 8 weeks (±4 days) after the first dose for the 
first 24 weeks (independent of dose delays), then every 12 weeks (±4 days). 
Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were balanced between the treatment arms. The 
median age was 71 years (range: 40 to 94 years); 86.8% White; 6.6% Black or African American; 
2.4% Asian; 92.4% had ECOG PS0-1; 7.6% had ECOG PS2. Randomisation was stratified by baseline 
lactate dehydrogenase (LDH ≤260 IU/L vs. >260 IU/L), presence of liver metastases (yes vs. no), 
ECOG PS score (0 or 1 vs. 2), and inclusion of an AR pathway inhibitor as part of BSoC at the time of 
randomisation (yes vs. no). At randomisation, all patients (100.0%) had received at least one prior 
taxane-based chemotherapy regimen and 41.2% of patients had received two; 97.1% of patients had 
received docetaxel and 38.0% of patients had received cabazitaxel. At randomisation, 51.3% of 
patients had received one prior AR pathway inhibitor, 41.0% of patients had received 2, and 7.7% of 
patients had received 3 or more. During the randomised treatment period, 52.6% of patients in the 
Pluvicto plus BSoC arm and 67.8% of patients in the BSoC alone arm received at least one AR 
pathway inhibitor. 
Efficacy results for VISION are presented in Table 3 and Figures 1 and 2. The final analyses of OS 
and rPFS were event-driven and conducted after the occurrence of 530 deaths and 347 events, 
respectively.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Pluvicto in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of PSMA-expressing prostate 
cancer (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan have been characterised in 30 patients 
in the phase III VISION sub-study. 
Absorption 
Pluvicto is administered intravenously and is immediately and completely bioavailable. 
The geometric mean blood exposure (area under the curve [AUCinf]) for lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide 
tetraxetan at the recommended dose is 52.3 ng.h/mL (geometric mean coefficient of variation [CV] 
31.4%). The geometric mean maximum blood concentration (Cmax) for lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide 
tetraxetan is 6.58 ng/mL (CV 43.5%). 
Distribution 
The geometric mean volume of distribution (Vz) for lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan is 123 L 
(CV 78.1%). 
Unlabelled vipivotide tetraxetan and non-radioactive lutetium (175Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan are each 
60% to 70% bound to human plasma proteins. 
Organ uptake 
The biodistribution of lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan shows primary uptake in lacrimal glands, 
salivary glands, kidneys, urinary bladder wall, liver, small intestine and large intestine (left and right 
colon). 
Elimination 
The geometric mean clearance (CL) for lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan is 2.04 L/h (CV 31.5%). 
Lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan is primarily eliminated renally. 
Half-life 
Pluvicto shows a bi-exponential elimination with a geometric mean terminal elimination half-life (t½) 
of 41.6 hours (CV 68.8%). 
Biotransformation 
Lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan does not undergo hepatic or renal metabolism. 
In vitro evaluation of drug interaction potential 
CYP450 enzymes 
Vipivotide tetraxetan is not a substrate of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymes. It does not induce 
cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, 2B6 or 3A4, and it does not inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2, 2B6, 
2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6 or 3A4/5 in vitro. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Transporters 
Vipivotide tetraxetan is not a substrate of BCRP, P-gp, MATE1, MATE2-K, OAT1, OAT3 or OCT2, 
and it is not an inhibitor of BCRP, P-gp, BSEP, MATE1, MATE2-K, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OCT1 or OCT2 in vitro. 
Special populations 
Effects of age and body weight 
No clinically significant effects on the pharmacokinetic parameters of lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide 
tetraxetan were identified for the following covariates assessed in 30 patients in the phase III VISION 
sub-study: age (median: 67 years; range: 52 to 80 years) and body weight (median: 88.8 kg; range: 
63.8 to 143.0 kg). 
Renal impairment 
Exposure (AUC) of lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan increased by 20% in patients with mild renal 
impairment compared to normal renal function. Kidney dosimetry half-life also increased in patients 
with mild renal impairment compared to normal renal function, 51 hours vs. 37 hours, respectively. 
Patients with mild or moderate renal impairment may be at greater risk of toxicity (see section 4.4). 
No pharmacokinetic data are available for patients with moderate to severe renal impairment with 
baseline CLcr <50 mL/min or end-stage renal disease. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
No toxicological effects were observed in safety pharmacology or single-dose toxicity studies in rats 
and minipigs administered a non-radioactive formulation containing unlabelled vipivotide tetraxetan 
and lutetium (175Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan, or in repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats administered 
unlabelled vipivotide tetraxetan. 
Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity 
Mutagenicity and long-term carcinogenicity studies have not been carried out with lutetium (177Lu) 
vipivotide tetraxetan; however, radiation is a carcinogen and mutagen.

6.4  Special precautions for storage 
Do not freeze. 
Store in the original package in order to protect from ionising radiation (lead shielding). 
Storage of radiopharmaceuticals should be in accordance with national regulations on radioactive 
materials. 
6.5  Nature and contents of container 
Clear, colourless type I glass vial, closed with a bromobutyl rubber stopper and aluminium seal. 
Each vial contains a volume of solution that can range from 7.5 mL to 12.5 mL corresponding to a 
radioactivity of 7 400 MBq ±10% at the date and time of administration. 
The vial is enclosed within a lead container for protective shielding. 
6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
General warning 
Radiopharmaceuticals should be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in 
designated clinical settings. Their receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the 
regulations and/or appropriate licences of the competent official organisation. 
Radiopharmaceuticals should be prepared in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety and 
pharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken. 
For instructions on preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 12. 
If at any time in the preparation of this medicinal product the integrity of the lead container or the vial 
is compromised it should not be used. 
Administration procedures should be carried out in a way to minimise risk of contamination of the 
medicinal product and irradiation of the operators. Adequate shielding is mandatory. 
The administration of radiopharmaceuticals creates risks for other persons from external radiation or 
contamination from spill of urine, vomiting, etc. Radiation protection precautions in accordance with 
national regulations must therefore be taken. 
This preparation is likely to result in a relatively high radiation dose to most patients. The 
administration of Pluvicto may result in significant environmental hazard. This may be of concern to 
the immediate family of those individuals undergoing treatment or the general public depending on the 
level of activity administered. Suitable precautions in accordance with national regulations should be 
taken concerning the activity eliminated by the patients in order to avoid any contaminations. 
Lutetium-177 for Pluvicto may be prepared using two different sources of stable isotopes (either 
lutetium-176 or ytterbium-176). Lutetium-177 for Pluvicto prepared using the stable isotope 
lutetium-176 (“carrier added”) requires special attention with regard to waste management due to the 
presence of the long-lived metastable lutetium-177 (177mLu) impurity with a half-life of 160.4 days. 
Lutetium-177 for Pluvicto is prepared using ytterbium-176 (“non-carrier added”) unless otherwise 
communicated on the product batch release certificate. The user must consult the product batch release 
certificate provided before using Pluvicto to ensure appropriate waste management. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

11.  DOSIMETRY 
Radiation dose to specific organs, which may not be the target organ of therapy, can be influenced 
significantly by pathophysiological changes induced by the disease process. This should be taken into 
consideration when using the following information. 
Dosimetry of lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan was collected in 29 patients in the phase III 
VISION sub-study, in order to calculate whole body and organ radiation dosimetry. The mean and 
standard deviation (SD) of the estimated absorbed doses to different organs for adult patients receiving 
Pluvicto are shown in Table 4. The organs with the highest absorbed doses are lacrimal glands and 
salivary glands. 
The maximum penetration of lutetium-177 in tissue is approximately 2 mm and the mean penetration 
is 0.67 mm.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR PREPARATION OF RADIOPHARMACEUTICALS 
The user must consult the product batch release certificate provided before using Pluvicto to ensure 
appropriate waste management (see section 6.6). 
Withdrawals should be performed under aseptic conditions. The vials must not be opened before 
disinfecting the stopper, the solution should be withdrawn via the stopper using a single-dose syringe 
fitted with suitable protective shielding and a disposable sterile needle or using an authorised 
automated application system. 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Preparation instructions 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Use aseptic technique and radiation shielding when handling or administering Pluvicto, using 
tongs as needed to minimise radiation exposure. 
Visually inspect the vial under a shielded screen for particulate matter and discolouration prior 
to administration. Discard the vial if particulates and/or discolouration are present. 
Do not inject the Pluvicto solution directly into any other intravenous solution. 
Confirm the amount of radioactivity delivered to the patient with an appropriately calibrated 
dose calibrator prior to and after Pluvicto administration. 
Intravenous methods of administration 
Instructions for the syringe method (with or without a syringe pump) 
• 
After disinfecting the vial stopper, withdraw an appropriate volume of Pluvicto solution to 
deliver the desired radioactivity by using a disposable syringe fitted with a syringe shield and a 
disposable sterile needle. 
Administer Pluvicto to the patient by slow intravenous push within approximately 1 to 
10 minutes (either with a syringe pump or manually without a syringe pump) via an intravenous 
catheter that is pre-filled with sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection and 
that is used exclusively for Pluvicto administration to the patient. 
Once the desired Pluvicto radioactivity has been administered, perform an intravenous flush of 
≥10 mL of sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection through the 
intravenous catheter to the patient. 
Instructions for the gravity method (with or without an infusion pump) 
• 
Insert a 2.5 cm, 20 gauge needle (short needle) into the Pluvicto vial and connect via a catheter 
to 500 mL sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection (used to transport the 
Pluvicto solution during the infusion). Ensure that the short needle does not touch the Pluvicto 
solution in the vial and do not connect the short needle directly to the patient. Do not allow the 
sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection to flow into the Pluvicto vial 
prior to the initiation of the Pluvicto infusion and do not inject the Pluvicto solution directly into 
the sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. 
Insert a second needle that is 9 cm, 18 gauge (long needle) into the Pluvicto vial, ensuring that 
the long needle touches and is secured to the bottom of the Pluvicto vial during the entire 
infusion. Connect the long needle to the patient by an intravenous catheter that is pre-filled with 
sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection and that is used exclusively for 
the Pluvicto infusion into the patient. 
Use a clamp or an infusion pump to regulate the flow of the sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for injection via the short needle into the Pluvicto vial (the sterile sodium 
chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection entering the vial through the short needle will 
carry the Pluvicto solution from the vial to the patient via the intravenous catheter connected to 
the long needle within approximately 30 minutes). 
During the infusion, ensure that the level of solution in the Pluvicto vial remains constant. 
Disconnect the vial from the long needle line and clamp the sodium chloride line once the level 
of radioactivity is stable for at least five minutes. 
Follow the infusion with an intravenous flush of ≥10 mL of sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for injection through the intravenous catheter to the patient.

21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Instructions for the vial method (with a peristaltic infusion pump) 
• 
Insert a 2.5 cm, 20 gauge needle (short venting needle) into the Pluvicto vial. Ensure that the 
short needle does not touch the Pluvicto solution in the vial and do not connect the short needle 
directly to the patient or to the peristaltic infusion pump. 
Insert a second needle that is 9 cm, 18 gauge (long needle) into the Pluvicto vial, ensuring that 
the long needle touches and is secured to the bottom of the Pluvicto vial during the entire 
infusion. Connect the long needle and a sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for 
injection to a 3-way stopcock valve via appropriate tubing. 
Connect the output of the 3-way stopcock valve to tubing installed on the input side of the 
peristaltic infusion pump following the pump manufacturer’s instructions. 
Pre-fill the line by opening the 3-way stopcock valve and pumping the Pluvicto solution through 
the tubing until it reaches the exit of the valve. 
Pre-fill the intravenous catheter which will be connected to the patient by opening the 3-way 
stopcock valve to the sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection and 
pumping the sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection until it exits the end 
of the catheter tubing. 
Connect the pre-filled intravenous catheter to the patient and set the 3-way stopcock valve such 
that the Pluvicto solution is in line with the peristaltic infusion pump. 
Infuse an appropriate volume of Pluvicto solution at approximately 25 mL/h to deliver the 
desired radioactivity. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•  When the desired Pluvicto radioactivity has been delivered, stop the peristaltic infusion pump 
and then change the position of the 3-way stopcock valve so that the peristaltic infusion pump is 
in line with the sterile sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. Restart the 
peristaltic infusion pump and infuse an intravenous flush of ≥10 mL of sterile sodium chloride 
9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection through the intravenous catheter to the patient. 
Quality control 
The solution should be visually inspected for damage and contamination before use, and only clear

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Pluvicto is and what it is used for 
What Pluvicto is 
Pluvicto contains lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan. This medicine is a radiopharmaceutical 
product for therapy only. 
What Pluvicto is used for 
Pluvicto is used to treat adults with progressive castration-resistant prostate cancer that has spread to 
other parts of the body (metastatic) and has already been treated with other cancer treatments. 
Castration-resistant prostate cancer is a cancer of the prostate (a gland of the male reproductive 
system) that does not respond to treatment that reduces male hormones. Pluvicto is used if the prostate 
cancer cells have a protein on their surface called prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA). 
How Pluvicto works 
Pluvicto binds to PSMA found on the surface of the prostate cancer cells. Once bound, the radioactive 
substance in Pluvicto, lutetium-177, gives off radiation that causes the prostate cancer cells to die. 
Your doctor will carry out tests to see if PSMA is present on the surface of the cancer cells. Your 
cancer is more likely to respond to treatment with Pluvicto if the test result is positive. 
The use of Pluvicto involves exposure to amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the nuclear 
medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit that you will obtain from the procedure with 
the radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk due to radiation. 
If you have any questions about how Pluvicto works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, 
ask your nuclear medicine doctor. 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before Pluvicto is used 
Follow all instructions given by your nuclear medicine doctor carefully. They may differ from the 
general information contained in this leaflet. 
Pluvicto must not be used 
- 
if you are allergic to lutetium (177Lu) vipivotide tetraxetan or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
If any of these apply to you, tell your nuclear medicine doctor before receiving Pluvicto: 
- 
if you have low levels of certain types of cells in the blood (red blood cells, white blood cells, 
neutrophils, platelets) 
if you have or have had tiredness, weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath, bleeding or bruising 
more easily than normal or bleeding for longer than normal, or frequent infections with signs 
such as fever, chills, sore throat or mouth ulcers (possible signs of myelosuppression [a 
condition in which the bone marrow cannot make enough blood cells]) 
if you have or have had kidney problems 
if you have or have had any other type of cancer or treatment for cancer, as Pluvicto contributes 
to your overall long-term cumulative radiation exposure 
- 
- 
- 
Before administration of Pluvicto you should: 
- 
drink plenty of water so that you remain hydrated and urinate as often as possible during the 
first hours after administration 
Children and adolescents 
The safety and efficacy of this medicine have not been established in children and adolescents under 
18 years of age. This medicine should not be given to children or adolescents aged under 18 years 
because no data are available in this age group.

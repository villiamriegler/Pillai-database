1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

SmPC, 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
Labelling and 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of Zessly 
PL 
in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing

Submission of the final study report of study GP11-
05/12/2019 
n/a 
The MAH has submitted complete comparative clinical 
301 including the results from treatment period 3, 
where all subjects continued to receive open-label 
Zessly (GP1111)  treatment for an additional 24 
weeks (Week 54 until Week 78). 
Study GP11-301 was a Phase 3 randomised, double-
blind study assessing the efficacy, safety and 
immunogenicity of GP1111 and infliximab-EU in 
combination with methotrexate in patients with 
moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis 
who have had an inadequate response to 
methotrexate.

manufacturing operation(s) take place, except batch

biol/immunol medicinal products or pharmaceutical 
forms manufactured by complex manufacturing 
processes 
B.II.b.2.a - Change to importer, batch release 
arrangements and quality control testing of the FP - 
Replacement/addition of a site where batch 
safety and immunogenicity data up to week 78 together 
with a comprehensive analysis of the data in patients with 
RA.  The treatment period 3 (TP3) relates to Week 54 
onwards, where all patients received Zessly until the end of 
the treatment period at Week 78. 
Overall, there were no clinically meaningful differences 
between the three treatment groups in TP3. The treatment 
exposure, discontinuation, adverse event and laboratory 
value patterns are in line with what was reported from TP1 
and TP2. Also immunogenicity data post week 54 to week 
78 were similar between treatment groups. No update to 
the product information was therefore considered 
necessary.

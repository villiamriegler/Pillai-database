Extension of Indication for Orencia in combination with methotrexate (MTX) in the treatment of adults with 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have highly active disease with poor prognostic factors (such as ACPA+ 
and/or RF+, joint erosion) not previously treated with MTX. As a consequence, sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the 
SmPC are updated based on results from AVERT study (IM101226). The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. Moreover, the updated RMP version 20 has been submitted. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included EMA Decisions P/100/2009 
(abatacept iv use) and P/0128/2014 (abatacept sc use) on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan 
(PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/100/2009 was completed and PIP P/0128/2014 was 
not yet completed as some measures were deferred.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EC)  No.  141/2000  and  Article  3  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No 
847/2000, the  MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised orphan 
medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to the 
proposed indication.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The active substance of Orencia, abatacept, is a fusion protein that consists of the extracellular domain of 
human  Cytotoxic  T-lymphocyte-associated  protein  4  (CTLA-4)  linked  to  a  modified  Fc  portion  of  human 
IgG1. Abatacept reversibly binds to CD 80/86 on antigen presenting cells via its CTLA-4 portion preventing 
the interaction of CD 80/86 with CD28 on T cells. This interaction provides a co-stimulatory signal necessary 
for  full  activation  of  T-lymphocytes.  Activated  T-lymphocytes  are  implicated  in  the  pathogenesis  of 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and are found in the synovium of patients with RA.  
Orencia  was  initially  approved  in  the  United  States of  America  for  the  treatment  of  adult  RA  patients  in 
Dec-2005  and  in  the  EU  for  intravenous  (iv)  administration  for  the  treatment  of  moderate  and  severe 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/639090/2016 
Page 6/72 
 
  
  
 
rheumatoid arthritis, in combination with MTX, in RA patients with an insufficient response to a TNF-alfa 
inhibitor  (TNF-IR)  in  2007.  Subsequently,  Orencia  was  authorised  for  the  treatment  of  moderately  to 
severely active JIA, in pediatric patients from 6 years of age in 2010 (EMA/H/C/00701/II-24).  
In the same year the indication was extended to include adult MTX-IR RA patients (EMA/H/C/00701/II-33),  
which also included data on MTX-naïve patients treated with IV abatacept (AGREE study; IM101023). Study 
IM101023 was a 1-year phase 3 multi-centre, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate remission and 
joint  damage  progression  in  MTX-naïve  early  erosive  rheumatoid  arthritis  subjects  with  abatacept  plus 
methotrexate  compared  with  methotrexate,  with  an  open  1  year  follow-up  (where  all  patients  received 
abatacept and methotrexate). 
Orencia was licensed for subcutaneous (sc) administration in 2012 (EMA/H/C/00701/X-54). Based on data 
from  clinical  studies 
IM101235  and 
IM101173,  a 
type 
II  variation  submitted 
in  2013 
(EMA/H/C/00701/II-77), an initial abatacept iv loading dose is not required to achieve clinical efficacy with 
abatacept sc. Therefore, the approved posology of sc abatacept in adults with moderate to severe RA is 
currently 125 mg administered subcutaneously once weekly with or without an IV loading dose.  
An alternative presentation Orencia pre-filled pen (autoinjector) was introduced for sc self-administration in 
2015. 
Currently, three TNF-inhibitors (adalimumab, etanercept and golimumab) and one interleukin six inhibitor 
(tocilizumab) are approved in the EU for the treatment of patients with severe, active and progressive RA not 
previously  treated  with  MTX  and  two  TNF-inhibitors  (infliximab  and  certolizumab  pegol)  for  patients  not 
previously treated with MTX or other DMARDs.  
Guidelines  from the  European  League  Against  Rheumatism  (EULAR),  American  College  of  Rheumatology 
(ACR),  and the French Society of Rheumatologists (SFR) working group, specifically recommends the very 
early use (within 6 months of diagnosis) of biological therapy in patients with poor prognostic factors such as 
ACPA positivity, RF positivity, joint erosion, and high disease activity.  
This type II variation application was initially to extend the current indication of Orencia in combination with 
methotrexate (MTX) to the “treatment of adult patients to patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have 
highly active disease with poor prognostic factors (such as ACPA+ and/or RF+, joint erosion) not previously 
treated with MTX.”  
No amendments to the currently approved posology in adult patients were proposed with this application. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Abatacept is a protein composed of natural amino acids and therefore is exempted from testing because of 
its chemical structure in accordance with the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00). 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/639090/2016

The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
• 
Tabular overview of clinical studies  
In support of this type II extension of indication variation the MAH has provided the final results of a single 
study IM101226, the AVERT Study.  
In addition as supplementary evidence the MAH referred to data from study IM101023 (AGREE), which has 
been assessed previously EMA/H/C/00701/II-033 in 2010. This study was a 1-year phase 3 multi-centre, 
randomized, double-blind study to evaluate remission and joint damage progression in methotrexate-naïve 
early  erosive  rheumatoid  arthritis  subjects  (n=509)  with  abatacept  plus  methotrexate  compared  with 
methotrexate, with an open 1  year follow-up (where all patients received abatacept and methotrexate), 
using the IV formulation of abatacept supports this application.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics (PK) of abatacept in healthy adults and adults with RA have been characterised 
previously and are summarised adequately in the current product information. Further evaluation of the PK 
of abatacept was not submitted with this application which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Anti-CCP and Rheumatoid Factor  
All  but  2  subjects  in  study  IM101226  were  positive  for  anti-CCP  at  baseline,  consistent  with  protocol 
requirements. While most subjects in all 3 treatment groups remained positive for anti-CCP at the end of the 
Treatment  Period  (TP  Day  365),  the  percentage  who  became  negative  for  anti-CCP  was  higher  for  the 
abatacept + MTX group (8/98, 8%) than for the MTX monotherapy (1/94, 1%) or abatacept monotherapy 
(1/85, 1%) groups. At the end of the Withdrawal Period (WP Day 365), all subjects who were positive for 
anti-CCP  remained  positive  and  the  subject  in  the  abatacept  monotherapy  group  who  was  negative  for 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/639090/2016 
Page 8/72 
 
  
  
 
anti-CCP remained negative. The majority of the subjects in all 3 treatment groups remained positive for 
anti-CCP  at  the  end  of  the  Re-exposure  Period  (RP  Day  169);  a  higher  percentage  of  subjects  in  the 
abatacept + MTX group (5/46, 11%) were negative for anti-CCP compared with the abatacept monotherapy 
(0/41, 0%) and MTX monotherapy (1/37, 2.7%) groups. 
Similarly, the percentage of subjects who were RF positive at baseline but RF negative at TP Day 365 was 
higher  for  the  abatacept  +  MTX  group  (16/95,  17%)  than  for  the  MTX  monotherapy  (10/93,  11%)  or 
abatacept monotherapy (6/83, 7%) groups. None of the 5 subjects in the abatacept + MTX group who were 
RF negative at baseline seroconverted during the Treatment Period, compared to 1 of 6 subjects in the MTX 
monotherapy group and 1 of 3 subjects in the abatacept monotherapy group. At the end of the Withdrawal 
Period (WP Day 365), the majority (≥90% in each group) of the subjects were still RF positive. At the end of 
the Re-exposure Period, the percentage of subjects who were RF positive at baseline but RF negative at RP 
Day 169 was higher for the abatacept + MTX group (4/46, 9%) than for the MTX monotherapy (2/37, 5%) 
or abatacept monotherapy (2/39, 5%) groups. 
Changes from Baseline in hsCRP Levels 
Mean reductions were seen in hsCRP levels in all groups as early as TP Day 29 (first assessment time point), 
and in general, mean reductions during the Treatment Period were similar for the abatacept + MTX and 
abatacept monotherapy groups and smaller for the MTX monotherapy group. At TP Day 365, the mean (SE) 
reductions in hsCRP for the abatacept + MTX, abatacept monotherapy, and MTX monotherapy groups were 
-12.73  (2.24),  -11.63  (2.49),  and  -8.01  (2.27)  mg/L,  respectively.  Mean  hsCRP  values  rose  following 
discontinuation of study drug during the Withdrawal Period; at WP Day 365, the mean reductions in hsCRP 
for the abatacept + MTX, abatacept monotherapy, and MTX monotherapy groups were -4.19 (5.79), -2.57 
(6.50), and -10.01 (5.32) mg/L, respectively. Following retreatment with abatacept during the Re-exposure 
Period, mean hsCRP values returned to values seen during the Treatment Period; at RP Day 169, the mean 
reductions in hsCRP for the abatacept + MTX, abatacept monotherapy, and MTX monotherapy groups were 
-12.77 (3.02), -13.05 (3.06), and -13.85 (3.40) mg/L, respectively.  
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No  new  pharmacology  data  was  submitted  with  this  application  with  the  exception  of  some  limited 
pharmacodynamic data from the pivotal study IM101226. These include anti-CCP, Rheumatoid Factor Status 
(cross-classification),  and  hsCRP  Levels.  Data  on  immunogenicity  were  also  collected  but  these  are 
discussed in the Clinical Safety Section of this report. 
During  treatment  period,  the  percentage  that  became  negative  for  anti-CCP  or  RF  was  higher  for  the 
combination (abatacept + MTX) group than for the MTX monotherapy or abatacept monotherapy groups. 
However, the classification of the majority of patients remained unchanged. None of the 5 subjects in the 
combination group who were RF negative at baseline seroconverted during the treatment period (in contrary 
with  monotherapy  groups,  in  which  respectively  1-1  subjects  have  been  converted).  At  the  end  of  the 
withdrawal period the anti-CCP status of the patients was not changed, and in the end of the withdrawal 
period more than 90% of the subjects were still RF positive.  
Reductions were seen in hsCRP levels in all groups as early as day 29, and in general, mean reductions 
during the treatment period were similar for the abatacept + MTX and abatacept monotherapy groups but 
smaller  for  the  MTX  monotherapy  group.  These  changes  reversed  upon  discontinuation  and  returned  to 
similar decreased levels after retreatment with abatacept.  
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The scope of the clinical pharmacology program of Study IM101226 was limited and did not provide any 
information that would warrant an update to the product information.

Abatacept for injection was supplied as pre-filled, ready-to-use, glass syringes each containing 125 mg of 
abatacept per syringe (125 mg/mL). Abatacept was administered SC by the subject on Day 1 and weekly 
thereafter during the Treatment Period.  
Reference therapy, Dose and mode of administration, duration of treatment  
Methotrexate was supplied as 2.5 mg tablets for weekly oral administration during the Treatment Period, 
and was titrated over a period of 6 to 8 weeks based on tolerability: Week 1, 7.5 mg; Week 2, 10 mg; Week 
3,  12.5  mg;  Week  4,  15  mg;  Week  5,  17.5  mg;  Week  6,  20  mg.  The  maximum  tolerable  dose  of  MTX 
achieved at Week 6 was maintained throughout the remainder of the Treatment Period. Down titration was 
permitted  only  for  tolerability  reasons  to  a  minimum  of  10  mg/week.  Placebo  matching  abatacept  was 
supplied  as  pre-filled,  ready-to-use  glass  syringes  for  weekly  SC  administration  during  the  Treatment 
Period. Placebo matching MTX was supplied as similarly-appearing tablets for oral weekly administration 
during the Treatment Period.  
Prior and Concomitant medication 
The use of any approved or investigational biologic therapy for RA was prohibited. In addition, subjects 
were not to have received > 4 weeks of prior treatment with MTX at a dose of ≤ 10 mg/week, and were not 
to have received any MTX dose for at least 1 month prior to the screening visit. Any prior treatment with 
chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and/or sulfasalazine was to have been discontinued at least 28 days prior 
to randomization. Any prior use of azathioprine, gold, leflunomide, mycophenylate mofetil, cyclosporine, 
other calcineurin inhibitors,  D-penicillamine,  or  immunosorption  columns  must  have  been  discontinued 
at  least 3 months  prior  to  the  screening  visit.  Subjects  who  were  enrolled  on  oral  corticosteroids  were 
required to be on a stable, low dose (i.e., ≤ 10 mg prednisone equivalent) for at least 4 weeks prior to 
randomization,  and  prior  use  of  an  injectable  corticosteroid  was  to  be  given  at  least 4 weeks prior to 
randomization. In addition, up to two of the following high dose corticosteroid courses are permitted during 
the treatment period at the discretion of the investigator: a short (maximum 2 week) oral course of high 
dose corticosteroids (according to local standard of care); a single IM or IV dose of a corticosteroid; a single 
intra-articular injection of corticosteroids. 
The administration of a live virus vaccine was prohibited for a minimum of 3 months prior to the first dose 
of study drug, during the study, and for 3 months after the last dose of study drug. 
The use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), including aspirin, was permitted during the 
Treatment Period, except within 12 hours prior to a joint count assessment, provided the dose was stable. 
The only acceptable reason for a decrease in NSAID dosage was toxicity or intolerance. 
Subjects were permitted to take the following analgesics during the study for the treatment of pain not 
adequately controlled by baseline and study medications, except for the 12 hours prior to a joint count 
assessment:  acetaminophen  (paracetamol),  narcotic  analgesics  or  combination  products  containing 
acetaminophen and a narcotic analgesic, or tramadol.

Withdrawal Period 
No treatment with abatacept or placebo SC was administered during the Withdrawal Period. The dose of MTX 
or placebo tablets at the end of the Treatment Period was tapered downward to a dose of 0 mg over the first 
month of the Withdrawal Period at a rate of decrease of at least 1 tablet/week. Corticosteroids were also 
tapered. 
All subjects who entered the Re-exposure Period received open-label abatacept 125 mg SC and oral MTX 
tablets once weekly. Subjects were permitted to adjust the restricted medications at the discretion of the 
investigator based upon the subject’s clinical status. 
In addition, one of the following therapies could be added at the investigators discretion and according to the 
manufacturer’s recommendations: sulfasalazine, chloroquine, or hydroxychloroquine. 
Any  concomitant  medication  listed  in  the  prescribing  label  of  the  subject’s  background  therapy  was 
evaluated by the Investigator for continued administration during the subject’s participation in this study.  
Prohibited medication was the same as for the Treatment Period except subjects receiving treatment with 
oral corticosteroids who should have them tapered during the first month. 
In addition, one of the following high dose corticosteroid courses was permitted during the withdrawal period 
at the discretion of the investigator: A short (maximum 2 week) oral course of high dose corticosteroids 
(according  to  local  standard  of  care);  A  single  IM  or  IV  dose  of  a  corticosteroid;  A  single  intra-articular 
injection of corticosteroids. 
These allowances did not apply within 28 days of the WP 169 visit. A joint that received an intra-articular 
injection was counted as ‘active’ for the remainder of the study. 
Re-exposure Period 
Same as Treatment/Withdrawal Period except DMARDs were permitted.   
Objectives 
The  2  co-primary  objectives  were  to  compare  the  clinical  efficacy  of  abatacept  in  combination  with 
methotrexate (MTX) to MTX alone on the following: 
• The proportion of randomized and treated subjects with Disease Activity Score 28 based on C-reactive 
protein (DAS28-CRP) < 2.6 at Month 12 
• The proportion of randomized and treated subjects with DAS28-CRP < 2.6 at both Month 12 and Month 18.  
Secondary study objectives included: 
• To assess physical function and health-related quality of life using Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) 
and Short-Form 36 (SF-36) (version 2.0) in the abatacept/MTX combination, abatacept monotherapy, and 
MTX monotherapy arms 
• To assess joint damage progression by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scoring at Months 6, 12, and 18 
in the abatacept/MTX combination, abatacept monotherapy, and MTX monotherapy arms 
• To assess safety and tolerability including immunogenicity in the abatacept/MTX combination, abatacept 
monotherapy, and MTX monotherapy arms 
Outcomes/endpoints 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/639090/2016 
Page 14/72 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The pre-specified co-primary efficacy endpoints were: 
• The proportion of randomized and treated subjects in the abatacept + MTX and MTX monotherapy groups 
in DAS28-CRP remission (defined as DAS28-CRP score < 2.6) at TP Day 365 (Month 12 after randomization) 
• Proportion of randomized and treated subjects in the abatacept + MTX and MTX monotherapy groups in 
DAS28-CRP Remission at both TP Day 365 and WP Day 169 (Months 12 and 18, after randomization). 
Pre-specified secondary efficacy endpoints (selected):  
• Proportion of subjects in DAS28-CRP Remission at WP Day 169 (Month 18) who were in DAS28-CRP LDAS 
(DAS28-CRP < 3.2) at TP Day 365 (Month 12 after randomization) 
• Proportion of subjects achieving a HAQ response at Day 169 (Month 6 after randomization), as measured 
by a reduction of at least 0.3 units from baseline in HAQ Disability Index (HAQ-DI) 
•  Adjusted  mean  change  from  baseline  over  time  in  DAS28-CRP,  adjusted  for  baseline  value  and 
corticosteroid use stratification  
• Proportion of subjects achieving SDAI-defined remission criteria of ≤ 3.3 at TP Day 365 (Month 12 after 
randomization) and at WP Day 169 (Month 18 after randomization) 
• Proportion of subjects with a HAQ response (defined as a reduction from baseline in the HAQ-DI of at least 
0.3 points) over time 
• Adjusted mean change from baseline over time in HAQ-DI  
• Adjusted mean change from baseline in erosion, synovitis and osteitis scores based on MRI scoring at TP 
Day 169, TP Day 365, WP Day 169, and WP Day 365 (Study Months 6, 12, and 18 after randomisation). 
Sample size 
A total of 116 subjects per treatment group (approximately 348 total subjects) was assumed to yield 90% 
power to detect a difference of 22% in the first co-primary efficacy endpoint, the proportion of subjects in 
remission at Month 12 in the Treatment Period between the abatacept + MTX and MTX monotherapy groups. 
This power estimate assumed a 2-sided alpha level of 5%, and that 60% of subjects in the abatacept + MTX 
group would be in DAS28-CRP remission at Month 12 (TP Day 365) compared with 38% of the subjects in the 
MTX monotherapy group. It was further assumed that 48% of subjects in the abatacept monotherapy group 
would be in DAS28-CRP remission at Month 12 (TP Day 365), yielding an expected treatment difference from 
MTX  of  10%  in  favor  of  abatacept  monotherapy.  A  total  of  116  subjects  randomized  to  the  abatacept 
monotherapy  group  would  yield  a  half-length  of  the  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  around  that  10% 
treatment difference of 13.5%. 
Conditional  on  the  first  co-primary  efficacy  analysis  being  statistically  significant,  a  sample  size  of  116 
subjects per treatment group would also provide 98% power for the second co-primary efficacy analysis - 
comparison of the proportion of subjects in DAS28-CRP remission at both Month 12 [TP Day 365] and Month 
18 [WP Day 169]) between the abatacept + MTX group and the MTX monotherapy group for intent-to treat 
(ITT) population. 
Randomisation 
At the time of enrolment, each subject was assigned a unique sequential subject number for identification 
throughout  the  study  via  the  Central  Randomisation  System  (interactive  voice  randomization  system 
[IVRS]). Sites were to contact the Central Randomization System when subjects provided informed consent. 
Randomization  schedules  were  generated  and  retained  by  the  Randomization  Group  within  Drug  Supply 
Management of BMS until study un-blinding. Each subject who was qualified for randomization was assigned 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/639090/2016 
Page 15/72 
 
  
  
 
a  unique  randomization  number  via  IVRS  in  the  order  in  which  the  subjects  qualified  for  treatment. 
Randomization was stratified by corticosteroid use at the time of the screening visit. After completion of all 
screening evaluations, all eligible subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to abatacept SC + MTX, abatacept SC + 
placebo tablets, or MTX + placebo SC based on corticosteroid use.  
Blinding (masking) 
The  subjects  and  clinical  investigational  staff  were  blinded  to  the  randomized  treatment  assignment 
throughout the Treatment Period. 
Statistical methods 
The populations for analyses were defined by study periods. 
Treatment Period 
Unless  otherwise  specified,  analyses  of  efficacy  and  outcome  endpoints  for  the  Treatment  Period  were 
performed using the Intention to Treat (ITT) analysis population. Analyses of safety and exposure data for 
the Treatment Period were based on the As-treated analysis population. 
Withdrawal and Re-exposure Periods 
Unless otherwise specified, analyses of efficacy endpoints involving time points during the Withdrawal and 
Re-exposure Periods were reported for the ITT analysis population. For the efficacy analyses, subjects were 
analyzed  according  to  the  treatment  to  which  they  were  randomized  in  the  Treatment  Period.  Safety 
analyses (AEs, clinical laboratory data, and vital signs) for the Withdrawal and Re-exposure Periods were 
performed  using  the  All  Treated  Subjects  Entering  the  Withdrawal  Period  analysis  population  or  the  All 
Treated  Subjects  Entering  the  Re-exposure  Period  analysis  population,  respectively,  that  included  all 
subjects who continued into the Withdrawal or Re-exposure Periods.  
Efficacy Analyses 
Except for the co-primary efficacy analyses, no formal statistical testing was performed for any secondary 
efficacy endpoints. 
All construction of CIs for a response rate within a treatment group for a specific time point were based on 
normal approximation, provided there were at least 5 events in each treatment group; otherwise, the exact 
method  was  used.  The  95%  CI  for  treatment  difference  in  response  rate  was  constructed  using  the 
continuity correction. All tests and CIs were 2-sided. 
Unless  otherwise  specified,  adjusted  mean  changes  from  baseline  were  analyzed  using  a  longitudinal 
repeated  measures  analysis  with  direct  likelihood  estimation  on  the  change  form  baseline,  using  an 
observed  cases  dataset.  For  each  scale  (DAS28-CRP,  SDAI,  etc.),  the  model  included  fixed  categorical 
effects of treatment, months, prior corticosteroid use (Yes/No),months-by-treatment interaction as well as 
the continuous fixed covariate of baseline value. An unstructured covariance matrix was used to represent 
the correlation of the repeated measures within each subject.  
Co-primary Efficacy Analyses 
Statistical testing of the 2 co-primary efficacy endpoints was conducted in a hierarchical fashion to maintain 
the overall Type I error rate at 5%. Specifically, formal treatment comparison of the proportion of subjects 
in DAS28-CRP remission at both Month 12 and Month 18 (second co-primary endpoint) was performed only 
if  the  treatment  comparison  of  the  proportion  of  subjects  in  DAS28-CRP  remission  at  Month  12  (first 
co-primary endpoint) was statistically significant. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/639090/2016 
Page 16/72 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Analysis of the first co-primary endpoint involved a comparison of the abatacept + MTX group and the MTX 
monotherapy group using an adjusted logistic regression test that included treatment, baseline DAS28-CRP 
value, and the stratification factor of corticosteroid use at baseline (Yes/No) as explanatory variables in the 
model, and was tested at a 5% significance level. In this analysis, all subjects who prematurely discontinued 
the  study  for  any  reason  were  considered  not  to  have  achieved  remission.  The  odds  ratio  estimate, 
corresponding 95% CI, and p-value were provided from the logistic regression for abatacept + MTX vs. MTX 
monotherapy. 
Analysis of the second co-primary endpoint used a similar adjusted logistic regression test. All subjects who 
prematurely discontinued the study for any reason, or who were not eligible to enter the Withdrawal Period, 
or who entered the Re-exposure Period were considered not to have achieved remission for all time points 
after discontinuation date or entry into the Re-exposure Period. 
As a sensitivity analysis for both co-primary efficacy analyses, a stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) 
Chi-square test, stratified by corticosteroid use at baseline (Yes/No), was performed at a 5% significance 
level. The relative risk and the Chi-square p-value, along with its 95% CI were provided, together with the 
absolute treatment difference and corresponding 95% CI. 
Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
For all secondary efficacy analyses examining remission, subjects who prematurely discontinued the study 
for any reason, or who were not eligible to enter the Withdrawal Period, or who entered the Re-exposure 
Period were considered not to have achieved remission for all time points after discontinuation date or entry 
into the Re-exposure Period. 
With respect to analyses of MRI data, in the event that there were > 20% of joints with a missing score for 
a parameter (erosion, osteitis, and synovitis), the MRI score of each parameter was considered missing. If 
there were ≤ 20% of joints with a missing score for a parameter, the MRI score for that parameter from the 
missing joints was carried forward from the previous MRI assessment, or carried backward from the next 
MRI assessment if missing score occurred at baseline.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol Deviations 
Significant Deviations 
The  most  common  types  of  significant  protocol  deviations  were  related  to  inclusion/exclusion  criteria 
deviations (84 subjects) and incorrect dosing or study drug assignment (83 subjects). A total of 61 subjects 
did not meet the inclusion criteria for active clinical synovitis at least 8 weeks before the screening visit. The 
most commonly reported dosing deviation involved a failure to follow MTX dosing recommendations or the 
titration schedule specified in the protocol (77 subjects). 
Changes in the Conduct of the Study 
There was 1 amendment to the protocol (dated 17-May-2011). The major changes to the protocol included 
the following:  
• update of the time frame for stable oral corticosteroid use as well as allowed routes of administration 
• inclusion of additional  secondary and exploratory objectives 
•addition of wash-out requirements for subjects taking chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, and sulfasalazine 
prior to randomization 
• addition of prohibited use of IA, IM, IV, or oral corticosteroids within 28 days of WP Day 169 
• additional text to clarify MTX titration during the Treatment Period 
• definition of SDAI and CDAI and inclusion of these 2 new analyses as secondary and exploratory objectives 
Changes to the Planned Analyses 
Changes Prior to Database Un-blinding 
Prior  to  database  un-blinding,  the  primary  analysis  of  the  primary  efficacy  variable  was  changed  to  an 
adjusted logistic regression, and the protocol-specified analysis for this variable using the Chi-square test 
was  specified  as  a  sensitivity  analysis.  The  change  was  implemented  as  the  adjusted  logistic  regression 
allowed  all  subjects  from all  3 treatment  groups  to be  included in  the  analysis  model.  Prior  to  database 
un-blinding,  the  first  secondary  efficacy-related  objective  (i.e.,  abatacept  monotherapy  vs.  MTX 
monotherapy)  was  raised  in  the  ordering  of  secondary  objective  from  the  fourth  position  due  to  higher 
clinical relevance.  
Changes After Database Un-blinding 
After the database was un-blinded, the definition for determination of the SDAI was changed from an hsCRP 
unit of mg/L (as specified in the protocol and SAP) to mg/dL. Accordingly, all planned analyses for SDAI were 
repeated using the updated unit of measure for hsCRP. This change was implemented to allow comparison 
with other abatacept clinical studies that included SDAI as a study endpoint. Sensitivity analyses of efficacy 
and safety were conducted to assess the potential effect of missing or erroneous first or last dose dates.

Baseline data 
Baseline/Demographic Characteristics 
The 3 treatment groups were balanced with respect to demographic and baseline disease characteristics at 
entry into the Treatment Period (Tables 1 and 2).

Baseline is Day 1 of the study. Treatment groups represent treatment received in the Treatment Period. 
LDAS is defined as DAS28-CRP < 3.2, MDAS is defined as 3.2 <= DAS28-CRP <= 5.1 and HDAS is defined 
as DAS28-CRP > 5.1 
Majority of patients were positive for antibodies to citrullinated protein antigens (ACPA), with 90.8% of the 
patients  in  the  abatacept+MTX  group  having  high  anti-cyclic  citrullinated  peptide-2  (CCP2)  and  similar 
percentages for the abatacept and MTX groups (90.5 and 93.1 respectively). 
Previous treatments 
Anti-rheumatic  medication  history  was  generally  consistent  across  the  3  treatment  groups.  Prior  to 
screening, most of the subjects who were subsequently randomized had received anti-rheumatic therapy. 
Only 6% had received prior treatment with MTX. Less than half of the subjects had received prior treatment 
with oral and/or injectable corticosteroids, with a mean oral dose of 8.4 mg. 
There  was  little  change  in  the  percentage  of  subjects  who  received  NSAIDs  or  corticosteroids  during 
screening  and  at  enrolment  (79%  and  32%,  respectively)  relative  to  the  use  of  these  drugs  prior  to 
screening.  Two  subjects  assigned  to  the  abatacept  +  MTX  group  were  receiving  a  DMARD 
(hydroxychloroquine) during screening/enrolment. For both subjects, the DMARD was discontinued 1 day 
prior to the Day 1 visit. These were considered significant protocol deviations.  
Concomitant medication 
At Day 1, 32% of the randomized and treated subjects were receiving oral and/or injectable corticosteroids, 
and the use of these drugs was similar across the 3 treatment groups. Fewer subjects in the abatacept + 
MTX group received 1 or 2 courses of high-dose corticosteroid therapy during the Treatment Period 
compared with the other groups. 
The most common concomitant medications (other than corticosteroids) used during the Treatment Period 
(at least 20% in any treatment group) were folic acid (98% in all 3 groups), acetaminophen (28% to 34% 
across groups), diclofenac (19% to 24%), and omeprazole (19% to 33%). 
Numbers analysed 
Efficacy and safety data from all subjects were analyzed according to the treatment group assignment in 
accordance with the randomization schedule. 
The ITT and All Treated Subjects analysis populations for the Treatment Period were identical, and included 
351 subjects (119 in the abatacept + MTX group, 116 in the abatacept monotherapy group, and 116 in the 
MTX  monotherapy  group).  The  All  Treated  Subjects  Entering  the  Withdrawal  Period  analysis  population 
included 225 subjects who had entered the Withdrawal Period (84 in the abatacept + MTX group, 66 in the 
abatacept monotherapy group, and 75 in the MTX monotherapy group). 
The All Treated Subjects Entering the Re-exposure Period analysis population included 146 subjects who had 
entered the Re-exposure Period (55 in the abatacept + MTX group, 48 in the abatacept monotherapy group, 
and 43 in the MTX monotherapy group). 
Outcomes and estimation

Abatacept  125  mg/day  SC  in  combination  with  MTX  showed  significantly  higher  rates  of  remission  on 
treatment at Month 12 as well as significantly higher rates of sustained remission after withdrawal of all RA 
therapy compared with treatment with MTX alone (Month 12 and 18) (Table 3).

Month 12 and at Both at Months 12 and 18 in Study IM101226 – ITT Population 
Odds ratio and p-values are based on an Adjusted Logistic Regression test, including treatment (3 groups), baseline 
DAS28-CRP values as well as the stratification factor (corticosteroid use at baseline). ITT = Intent-to-treat; n = Number 
of subjects with DAS28-CRP Remission at Month 12, m = Number of subjects in the analysis, MTX = methotrexate, N/A 
= not applicable. 
Pre-specified Analyses Using CMH Chi-square Test 
Results of the sensitivity analyses of the co-primary endpoints, using a CMH Chi-square test stratified by 
baseline corticosteroid use, were consistent with those of the primary analyses using the adjusted logistic 
regression model. The treatment difference in the proportion of subjects in DAS28-CRP remission at Month 
12 was 15.65, and favored the abatacept + MTX group over the MTX monotherapy group. Similarly, there 
was a 7.37 difference in the proportion of subjects in DAS28-CRP remission at both Month 12 and Month 18 
between the abatacept +MTX and MTX monotherapy groups (Tables 4 and 5).

Post Hoc Analyses by disease activity at baseline 
Post hoc analysis of the proportion of subjects with DAS28-CRP remission  at  Month  12  by baseline disease 
activity is shown in Table 6. 
Table 6. Study IM101226 - Proportion of Subjects with DAS28-CRP Remission at Month 12 by Baseline 
Characteristic Factors - ITT Population 
DAS28-CRP Remission is defined as DAS28-CRP < 2.6. * Normal approximation is used if the number of subjects with 
DAS28-CRP Remission in subgroup for all treatment arms is at least 5. Otherwise an exact method is used. n = Number 
of subjects with measure/event of interest, m = Number of subjects in the analysis. Imputation rule: missing DAS28-CRP 
Remission not due to premature discontinuation and not at Treatment Period (TP) Day 1 or Withdrawal Period (WP) Day 
169 is imputed as DAS28-CRP Remission if missing value between 2 observed DAS28-CRP Remissions. 
Post Hoc Analyses of Missing First Dose Date 
To account for the subjects with missing first dose dates, a sensitivity analysis was conducted in which the 
IVRS randomization date was used as the first dose date for all subjects. Results of this sensitivity analysis 
were consistent with the primary analysis; 69 of 114 (60.5%) subjects in the abatacept + MTX group and 52 
of 114 (45.6%) subjects in the MTX monotherapy group met the criteria for DAS28-CRP remission (p = 
0.014).

Table 7 presents the adjusted hazard ratio of having a relapse (or flare) during the 12-month Withdrawal 
Period (WP) between the abatacept + MTX group and the MTX monotherapy group. The adjusted hazard 
ratio and p-values were estimated based on a COX proportional Hazard model that included treatment (3 
arms), baseline DAS28-CRP value, and the stratification factor (corticosteroid use at baseline).

The proportion of subjects with a clinically meaningful improvement (response) in physical function (change 
from  baseline  in  HAQ  DI  score  of  ≥  0.3)  was  greater  for  the  abatacept  +  MTX  group  than  for  the  MTX 
monotherapy group both at the end of the Treatment Period (67.2% vs 44%; treatment difference of 23.26, 
95%  CI  =  [10.05,  36.47])  and  6  months  after  withdrawal  of  all  study  medication  (22.7%  vs  10.3%; 
treatment difference of 12.3 [95% CI = 2.2, 22.5]). 
The proportion of subjects with a HAQ DI response in the abatacept monotherapy group at the end of the 
Treatment Period and 6 months into the Withdrawal Period was 52.6% and 16.43%, respectively. 
At Treatment Period Day 365 and Withdrawal Period Day 169 (Months 12 and 18 of study, respectively), the 
adjusted  mean  changes  from  baseline  in  the  HAQ-DI  score  were  -0.87  and  -0.52,  respectively,  for  the 
abatacept + MTX group; -0.73 and -0.49, respectively, for the abatacept monotherapy group; and -0.72 and 
-0.33, respectively, for the MTX monotherapy group. 
SDAI (corrected) at 12 months 
At Month 12 (Treatment Period Day 365), 50 subjects (42%) in the abatacept + MTX group and 34 subjects 
(29%) in the abatacept monotherapy group had achieved SDAI (corrected) remission compared with 29 
subjects (25%) in the MTX monotherapy group; the estimated treatment differences were 17.02 (95% CI: 
4.30, 29.73) and 4.31 (95% CI: -7.98, 16.61), respectively (abatacept + MTX or abatacept - MTX). 
Upon discontinuation of study treatment, SDAI remission rates declined in all treatment groups, and were 
small and similar for all 3 treatment groups (8, 5, and 5 subjects, respectively, in the abatacept + MTX, 
abatacept monotherapy, and MTX monotherapy groups by Withdrawal Period Day 169 (Month 18) (7% to 
12%). 
Inhibition of progression of structural damage up to 12 months and after 6 months of Withdrawal 
Treatment  with  abatacept  +  MTX  was  associated  with  a  reduced  progression  in  structural  damage,  as 
reflected by mean post baseline MRI erosion score, and improvements in MRI osteitis and synovitis scores at 
Month 12 (Treatment Period Day 365)  and at Moth 18 (Withdrawal Period Day 169) (Table 8).

Proportion of Subjects Achieving DAS28-CRP remission and MRI non-progression  
At both time points during the Treatment Period (6 and 12 months), a higher percentage of subjects in the 
abatacept  +  MTX  group  achieved  DAS28-CRP  remission  together  with  MRI  non-progression  in  erosion, 
osteitis, and synovitis (TP Day 365 values of 42.9%, 48.7%, and 49.6%, respectively) compared with the 
MTX monotherapy group (TP Day 365 values of 28.4%, 35.3%, and 35.3%, respectively). Treatment group 
differences from the MTX monotherapy group for the abatacept + MTX group at TP Day 169 and TP Day 365 
ranged from 12.11 to 14.41. 
A small number of subjects in all treatment groups achieved DAS28-CRP remission together with 
MRI non-progression in erosion, osteitis, or synovitis at 6 months after withdrawal of study drug 
(WP Day 169). The percentages for the abatacept + MTX group were 12.6%, 15.1%, and 15.1%, 
compared to the 6.9%, 7.8%, and 7.8%, respectively for the MTX monotherapy group. 
Boolean remission 
Boolean remission was defined as TJC out of 28 joints ≤1 and SJC out of 28 joints ≤1 and subject global 
assessment of disease activity (0-10 cm) ≤1 and hsCRP ≤ 1 mg/dL. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/639090/2016 
Page 26/72 
 
  
  
 
 
 
At TP Day 365, WP Day 169, and WP Day 365 (Months 12, 18, and 24, respectively), the Boolean rates were 
37%, 10%, and 3%, respectively, for the abatacept + MTX group, 27%, 8%, and 4%,  respectively, for the 
abatacept monotherapy group, and 22%, 3%, and 3%, respectively, for the MTX monotherapy group. The 
treatment differences from MTX monotherapy at the 3 time points (12, 18, 24 months) were 14.56 (95% CI 
= [2.19, 26.94]), 6.64 (95%CI = [-0.56, 13.83]), and 0.78 (95% CI = [-4.42, 5.97]), respectively, for the 
abatacept + MTX group. 
CDAI 
During the Treatment Period, CDAI remission (≤2.8) rates were higher in the abatacept + MTX group than 
in the MTX monotherapy group beginning at Treatment Period Day 29. 
At Month 12, 42% of subjects in the abatacept + MTX group and 31% subjects in the abatacept 
monotherapy group had achieved CDAI remission compared with 28% of subjects in the MTX  monotherapy 
group (estimated treatment differences of 14.43 [95% CI: 1.55, 27.32] and 3.45 (95% CI: -9.12, 16.02], 
respectively). 
ACR response rates 
ACR response rates over time in study IMI01226 are summarised in Table 9.

Time to discontinuation due to lack of efficacy 
The median time to discontinuation due to lack of efficacy using this definition was 16.9 months for the 
abatacept + MTX group and 15.2 months for the MTX monotherapy group, with a hazards ratio of 0.80 (95% 
CI = [0.5836, 1.0966]). The median time to discontinuation due to lack of efficacy across the entire study 
was similar for the abatacept monotherapy and MTX monotherapy groups (hazards ratio of 0.95, 95% CI = 
[0.6885, 1.3182]).  
Analysis of the time to discontinuation for lack of efficacy after Month 12 for the subjects who entered the 
Withdrawal Period also showed a slightly longer median time to discontinuation for the abatacept + MTX 
group (17.4 months) compared with the MTX monotherapy group (16.1 months), although the hazard ratio 
for this comparison was 0.91 (95% CI = [0.6212, 1.3192]). The median time to discontinuation for lack of 
efficacy among subjects who entered the Withdrawal Period was 17.8 months for the abatacept 
monotherapy group (hazard  ratio vs. MTX monotherapy of 0.95, 95% CI = [0.6390, 1.4260]).

Efficacy in the re-exposure period of study IM101226 
DAS28-CRP remission during the re-exposure period 
In study  IM101226, among the 146 subjects who experienced an RA flare and entered the Re-exposure 
Period, 64 subjects (43.84%) had achieved DAS28-CRP remission after 3 months (at RP Day 85) and 78 
subjects (53.42%) had achieved remission by 6 months (RP Day169) following the re-initiation of abatacept 
+ MTX treatment. The remission rates were generally similar based on previous randomized treatment with 
abatacept + MTX. 
The mean DAS28-CRP for all subjects entering the Re-exposure Period was 5.47 (SD 1.27). At the end of the 
Re-exposure  Period  (RP  Day  169),  the  change  in  DAS28-CRP  from  the  start  of  re-exposure  indicated  a 
substantial  decrease  in  disease  activity  (mean  change  from  start of  Re-exposure  Period  -3.05  [95%  CI: 
-3.34, -2.75]). Improvement was generally similar based on previous randomized treatment 
The mean difference in DAS28 CRP score between the abatacept + MTX and MTX monotherapy groups at the 
end of the Treatment Period (2.07 [SD: 0.58]) was similar to the score at the end of the Re-exposure Period 
(2.43 [SD: 0.95]).  
Re-exposure period HAQ-DI score 
Following 6 months of re-treatment with abatacept + MTX, the mean HAQ-DI score had decreased by a 
mean (SD) of 0.82 (0.07) points, indicating that subjects realized a meaningful improvement in physical 
function during the 6-month Re-exposure Period.

Supportive studies 
In addition to the pivotal study, results from study IM101023 (the AGREE study), and available comparative 
data  in  MTX-naive  patients  treated  with  adalimumab,  tocilizumab  and  abatacept  were  also  submitted  in 
support of this application. 
Summary of design and methods 
Study  IM101023  (previously  evaluated  by  the  CHMP  during  EMEA/H/C/  000701/II/0033)  was  a 
multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, 2-arm parallel-dosing study, designed to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety of abatacept IV+ MTX in MTX-naïve subjects with early, erosive RA. This 2-year study, with 1 year of 
double-blind treatment followed by 1 year of single-blind, open-label treatment, randomized subjects in a 
1:1 ratio to receive abatacept approximately 10 mg/kg, weight-tiered dose) + MTX (dose titrated to at least 
15 mg per week, not to exceed 20 mg per week) or IV placebo + MTX for the first 12 months of treatment. 
All  subjects  who  continued  into  the  second  year  of  treatment  received  open-label  abatacept  with  a 
background  of  MTX  for  12  months;  the  original  placebo  +  MTX  group  was  switched  to  abatacept  in  the 
second year. 
Overall study methods were similar in study IM101023 to study IM101226. The Randomised population was 
the same as the All Treated population: there were 509 subjects total (256 in the abatacept + MTX group 
and 253 in the placebo + MTX group). 
The co-primary objectives for study IM101023 during the initial 12-month blinded period were to compare 
the  clinical  efficacy  of  abatacept  used  in  combination  with  MTX  vs  placebo  +  MTX  on  the  following:  the 
proportion of subjects who achieved remission at Month 12 of treatment, as defined by a DAS28-C-reactive 
Protein  (CRP)  score  <  2.6  Joint  damage  progression  measured  by  radiographic  evaluation  using  the 
Genant-modified Sharp total score at Month 12. During the second-year, Open-label Period, the primary 
objectives  were  to  evaluate  long-term  safety  and  tolerability  of  abatacept  +  MTX.  Secondary  objectives 
included  assessments  of  physical  function  using  the  HAQ  disability  index  and  inhibition  of  joint  damage 
progression measured by radiographic evaluation using the Genant-modified Sharp scores (for erosion, JSN, 
and total score) at Month 24.  
Summary of results: 
The  baseline  demographic  characteristics  were  similar  for  both  treatment groups  (abatacept  +  MTX  and 
placebo + MTX). The majority of subjects were white females, men age approximately 50 years old. 
In study IM101023, the baseline clinical RA characteristics were similar for both groups (Table 11).

Table 11. Baseline disease characteristics in Study IMI01023 (All randomised and treated subjects) 
Antirheumatic  medications  prior  to  screening  were  similar  between  treatment  groups.  Subjects  were 
allowed prior MTX exposure of 10 mg per week for not more than 3 weeks and no dose for 3 months prior to 
signing the informed consent. In study IM101023, only 2% of subjects received prior treatment with MTX. 
Approximately half of subjects received prior treatment with oral and/or injectable corticosteroids. NSAID 
use prior to treatment was reported in 77% of subject in the abatacept + MTX group.  
In study IM101023, concomitant (or rescue) corticosteroid use was similar to study IM101226. At Day 1, 
31.6%  of  subjects  in  the  abatacept  +  MTX  group  and  28.5%  of  subjects  in  the  MTX  group  reported 
prednisone use. During the first 12 months of the study, 58.6% subjects in the abatacept + MTX group and 
62.5% of subjects in the MTX group reported oral and/or injectable corticosteroid use. The proportion of 
subjects who received corticosteroids (oral and/or injectable) was comparable for both groups during the 
open-label period and similar to that observed in the double-blind period. 
Two (2) subjects were randomized but not treated. The most frequent reasons for not being randomized 
were  subjects  no  longer  met  study  criteria,  the  subject  withdrew  informed  consent,  and  “other”. 
Discontinuations due to death were comparable between the 2 groups (2 subjects in each group). A total of 
232 (90.6%) subjects in the abatacept + MTX group and 227 (89.7%) subjects in the placebo + MTX group 
completed the first year of the study.  
All 459 subjects who completed the double-blind period were treated in the Open-label Period. Few subjects 
(26 [5.7%] subjects) discontinued from the Open-label Period; the most common reason for discontinuation 
was AE (11 [2.4%] subjects; 4 subjects in the original abatacept + MTX group and 7 subjects in the original 
placebo + MTX group). In addition, 2 subjects died (1 subject from each original treatment group). A total 
of 433 (94.3%) subjects completed the Open-label Period of the study. 
Outcomes 
Analysis  of  the  primary  efficacy  variable  for  study  IM101023  demonstrated  that  the  percent  of  subjects 
achieving remission, as defined by DAS28-CRP < 2.6, at Month 12 was significantly higher in the abatacept 
+ MTX group compared with the placebo + MTX group (41.4% versus 23.3%, p < 0.001)/

X-ray imaging was used to evaluate joint damage using a scoring technique based on the Genant-modified 
Sharp algorithm. Of the 509 subjects randomized and treated, 506 (99%) subjects had radiographic data 
collected at minimally 1 time point during the study. There were 484 (95%) subjects included in the primary 
radiographic analysis with data at both baseline and post-baseline (on Month 6, Month 12, and /or on the 
day of discontinuation).

This  analysis  revealed  that  subjects  in  the  abatacept  +  MTX  group  had  significantly  less  progression  of 
structural damage compared with the placebo + MTX group as demonstrated by the mean change  from 
baseline in total score at Month 12 (p = 0.040;) and over time using a Cumulative Distribution Function Plot.  
The mean change from baseline in total scores at Month 12 for the abatacept + MTX group  (0.63) was less 
than that in the placebo + MTX group (1.06).  
Post Hoc Analyses by disease activity at baseline 
Similar to the results from Study IM110226, subjects from study IM101023 were also analysed by disease 
activity at baseline (Table 13).

Abatacept efficacy comparisons with anti-TNF agents  
The ATTEST study examined the safety and efficacy of IV abatacept or infliximab relative to placebo, all on 
a background of MTX, in a MTX-IR population. The AMPLE study compared, in a 2 year head-to-head study, 
the efficacy and safety of SC abatacept and adalimumab, with background MTX, in patients with moderate 
to severely active MTX-IR RA population with mean disease duration of less than 2 years.

The PREMIER and FUNCTION studies were 2 large RCTs that compared adalimumab + MTX or tocilizumab + 
MTX, respectively, to MTX monotherapy in subjects with early RA, naive to therapy with MTX. The proportion 
of the subjects achieving remission and the ACR response rates from these studies are summarised in Table 
15.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The initial scope of this application was to extend the current indication of sc and iv abatacept in combination 
with MTX in the treatment of adults with moderate to severe RA who responded inadequately to previous 
therapy with one or more DMARDs, to the treatment of adults who have highly active disease with poor 
prognostic  factors  (such  as  ACPA+  and/or  RF+,  joint  erosion)  not  previously  treated  with  MTX.  Several 
clinical, laboratory and imaging features have been associated with aggressive disease or poor outcome in 
RA. The MAH initially chose ‘ACPA+ and/or RF+, joint erosion’ as examples of factors with poor prognosis, to 
define the intended target population.  Even though there is evidence that RF and ACPA positivity can serve 
as poor prognostic factors in RA, the validity of these factors as predictors of a poorer outcome was however, 
not considered to be unambiguously clear. On the other hand, the nature and the severity of the studied 
patient  population  were  substantiated  by  radiology  measurements.  The  high  MRI  baseline  mean  values 
indicated that patients had significant joint erosion i.e. had an active progressive disease already at this 
early  stage  of  the  disease.  Therefore,  the  revised  indication  for  the  treatment  of  highly  active  and 
progressive disease in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis not previously treated with methotrexate was 
considered appropriate by the CHMP. 
Efficacy was assessed in a single pivotal controlled clinical trial IM101226 (AVERT). The study compared 
abatacept in combination with MTX to MTX monotherapy and in a third arm to abatacept monotherapy. The 
aim was to show higher proportion of remission on the pre-specified co-primary endpoint of remission at 12 
months,  and  at  both  12  and  18  months,  for  abatacept  in  combination  with  MTX  compared  to  MTX 
monotherapy.    The  supportive  evidence  for  this  claim  includes  study  IM101023  (AGREE)  and  efficacy 
comparisons with anti-TNF agents (studies AMPLE IM1012358, and ATTEST IM1010439).  The results of 
AGREE, AMPLE and ATTEST studies have been previously submitted and evaluated.

Design and conduct of the pivotal clinical study 
The pivotal study IM101226 was a phase IIIb, randomised, active controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy and 
safety  of  abatacept  sc  in  combination  with  methotrexate  in  inducing  clinical  remission  compared  to  the 
active controls, methotrexate monotherapy and abatacept monotherapy, in adults with very early RA. 
Subjects  with  early  disease  (persistent  symptoms  for  less  than  2  years)  with  poor  prognostic  factors 
(seropositive,  structural  joint  damage)  were  enrolled.  Criteria  of  RA  according  to  2010  ACR/EULAR 
recommendations  were  not  required  at  inclusion.  However,  as  the  inclusion  criteria  of  the  pivotal  study 
closely correlated with the ACR/EULAR criteria, it was considered that the target population was appropriate. 
Subjects had to be MTX-and biologic-naive and have a minimum of 3.2 points on DAS28-CRP score. In the 
AGREE study, subjects having RA-diagnosis for less than 2 years were enrolled.  
In study IM101223, stable, low-dose steroid was permitted.  The co-primary endpoints were DAS-defined 
remission  rates  (DAS28-CRP  <  2.6)  at  Month  12  and  at  both  Month  12  and  Month  18.  Other  endpoints 
included other standard measures of disease activity (ACR-response rates, Boolean remission, SDAI, CDAI), 
physical function (HAQ-DI), and structural damage (MRI, using OMERACT RAMRIS scoring). 
The  study  comprised  three  periods:  the  Treatment  Period,  The  Withdrawal  Period  and  the  Re-exposure 
Period. Randomization was stratified according to corticosteroid use (yes/no) at baseline. The co-primary 
efficacy endpoints were assessed at the end of the Treatment Period (12 months) and after 6 months of the 
Withdrawal Period (at both 12 and 18 months).  
Statistics and analysis sets 
Efficacy  Analyses:  The  analyses  for  the  2  co-primary  efficacy  endpoints  were  performed  using  the 
intent-to-treat  (ITT)  analysis  population  by  randomized  treatment  group.  These  analyses  involved  a 
comparison of the abatacept + MTX group and the MTX monotherapy group using a logistic regression test 
adjusting  for  baseline  and  corticosteroid  use  at  baseline.  The  odds  ratio  estimate,  corresponding  95% 
confidence  interval  (CI),  and  p-value  for  the  2  comparisons  were  provided.  The  statistical  testing  was 
conducted in a hierarchical fashion to maintain the overall Type I error rate at 5%. For the first co-primary 
endpoint, all subjects who prematurely discontinued the study for any reason were considered not to have 
achieved remission.  
The other secondary endpoints were also analyzed using the ITT population. The method used for response 
rates were point estimates and 95% CI of treatment difference. The 95% CIs for a response rate within 
treatment  group  were  based  on  normal  approximation,  provided  there  were  at  least  5  events  in  each 
treatment group; otherwise, the exact method was used. The 95% CI for treatment difference in response 
rate was constructed using the continuity correction. The method used for continuous secondary endpoints 
was  a  longitudinal  repeated  measures  analysis  adjusting  for  baseline  and  corticosteroid  use  at  baseline 
including the observed data at all time points. The adjusted means, standard error and 95% CI for adjusted 
mean difference between  treatment groups (abatacept + MTX group vs. MTX monotherapy group) were 
provided. All CIs were 2-sided. 
No concerns were raised on the integrity of the blinding and the randomisation procedure was considered 
acceptable.  
Given the small number of subjects with relevant deviations, per-protocol analyses were not conducted. 
Baseline  demographics  and  disease  characteristics  were  well-balanced  across  the  three  treatment  arms 
suggesting a successful randomisation. Discontinuation during treatment period was generally low (17.4%) 
and the lowest in the combination group (13%). Discontinuation due to lack of efficacy was the highest in the 
MTX mono-arm (9.5%) and the lowest in the combination group (4.2%).  
Overall, no major concerns were raised on the conduct of the study.

Co-primary efficacy analysis  
In the treatment period, on the first co-primary end point, the proportions of RA subjects in remission at 
month 12 compared to treatment with MTX alone were respectively: 60.9 % vs 45.2 %, OR (95% CI) 2.01 
(1.18 3.43), p<0.01. The endpoint is a clinically relevant one for a MTX naïve RA population. The therapeutic 
effect was clear with an effect size comparable or even better than the MAH previous data in MTX-naïve 
patients. On the second co-primary endpoint of remission at both 12 and 18 months (Withdrawal Period) 
significantly higher rates of sustained remission after withdrawal of all RA therapy (Month 18) was also seen: 
14.8  %  vs  12.4%  OR  (95%  CI)  2.51  (1.02  6.18)  p<  0.045,  but  the  results  appeared  of  borderline 
significance.  These  findings  on  the  co-primary  end  point  showed  that  complete  withdrawal  of  all  study 
medications leads to relapse of remission in the majority of the patients. 
Furthermore, consistent post hoc analysis of efficacy across different subpopulations  showed that results 
were not driven by a particular patient subgroup (e.g. by baseline disease severity, RA diagnosis, time since 
RA  diagnosis  or  persistence  of  symptoms,  by  presence  of  erosion  at  baseline,  gender,  region  and  age). 
Especially in relation to baseline disease activity, there was no difference between patients with moderate 
disease activity at baseline (DAS-28 CRP between 3.2 and 5.1) and those with high baseline disease activity 
(DAS-28 CRP > 5.1). 
Secondary analyses  
A large number of secondary end points were analysed, however, it must be noted that no formal statistical 
analyses were performed on any of these variables. Superior efficacy of the combination to MTX is supported 
by a number of secondary endpoints of disease activity. However, DAS-remission, change from baseline 
DAS-scores and Boolean-remission, analysis show the same pattern: efficacy was evident at month 12, but 
the difference of the combination to MTX is not significant at 6 months following discontinuation of therapy.  
Withdrawal period 
The results of the withdrawal period showed a small, but significantly greater number of subjects achieving 
drug-free, DAS-defined remission. This effect however was likely not due solely to the long-term effects of 
abatacept,  as  assessments  were  performed  up  to  12  months  after  the  withdrawal  of  all  treatment  (>  5 
half-lives) and were more pronounced for abatacept+MTX than for abatacept monotherapy.  
Furthermore, a post hoc analyses showed that  the  risk  of  having  a  relapse  after withdrawal  of  all  study  
medications,  including  MTX,  was  similar  across  the  three  study groups. Therefore it was concluded that 
in  this  study  population  drug  withdrawal  leads  to  relapse  of  remission  in  the  majority  of  the  patients 
irrespective of treatment. 
Structural damage 
Use of MRI, instead of plain radiographs, to evaluate of structural damage, both as a response and as an 
inclusion criterion reflected in the indication, has so far been less common in RA clinical trial, at least in the 
EU regulatory setting. According to regulatory and ACR/EULAR clinical guidance it is recommended that in 
clinical  trials  structural  bone  damage  should  be  reported  by  x-rays.  CHMP  guidance  considers  MRI  as  a 
supportive tool. In the pivotal AVERT study of the current Application no radiographs were taken. Instead 
MRI data of the joints was accrued.  
The MAH, however, argued that joint damage – both synovitis and bone changes such as bone oedema or 
bone  cysts-  can  be  detected  within  weeks  of  the  onset  of  symptoms  more  sensitively  using  MRI  or 
ultrasound.  Radiographic  erosions  were  visualised  when  bone  decalcification  occurred,  and  a  lag  time 
between the onset of synovitis and radiographic bone erosion has been recognised. In contrast, MRI can 
detect synovitis and earlier bone lesions such as bone marrow inflammation (bone oedema) which may be 
a forerunner (or at least equivalent) of radiographic erosions (McGonagle et al, 1999).

The IM101102 study (Study II17) was first to demonstrate benefit to structural joint damage over 5 years 
of  therapy  with  IV  abatacept  +  MTX  in  subjects  with  an  inadequate  response  to  MTX.  Study  IM101023 
(Study  VI)  reproduced  the  benefits  of  IV  abatacept  on  structural  joint  damage  over  24  months  in  a 
MTX-naive, early RA population. Study IM101235 (Study SC-II20) then demonstrated the benefits of SC 
abatacept  +  MTX  on  inhibition  of  structural  joint  damage  over  a  2-year  blinded  treatment  period  in  a 
head-to-head comparison with adalimumab + MTX in subjects with an inadequate response to MTX with a 
mean disease duration of less than 2 years.  
Structural damage in the pivotal AVERT study:  
MRI measures were performed to assess change from baseline joint erosion and inflammation (osteitis and 
synovitis).  Even  though  inclusion  criteria  did  not  include  any  baseline  joint  erosion  measure,  high  MRI 
baseline mean values clearly indicated that the studied population had significant joint erosion. Change from 
baseline in erosion and inflammation scores showed that joint damage progressed slower and inflammation 
decreased more in the combination arm compared to monotherapy arms, as reflected by mean post baseline 
MRI erosion score, and larger improvements in MRI osteitis and synovitis scores at month 12 compared with 
the MTX monotherapy group. The treatment difference in MRI erosion scores favoring the abatacept + MTX 
group persisted 6 months after withdrawal of study treatment.   
Structural damage in the supportive AGREE study:  
At the time of the initial assessment of this supportive study the size of the radiological abatacept treatment 
effect as measured by radiographs appeared small and comparisons to other therapies could not be fully 
estimated, which argued against the use of abatacept as first-line monotherapy. In this study, the second 
structural  co  primary  end  point  showed  consistent  results  with  the  first  primary  outcome,  but  some 
reservations  on  the  size  of  the  effect  and  the  statistical  analyses  on  this  outcome  were  raised.  It  was 
subsequently  shown  that  the  results  on  this  endpoint  were  not  sensitive  to  the  choice  of  the  statistical 
analysis  method,  but  that  the  magnitude  of  the  effect  appeared  small.  Evaluation  of  joint  damage  was 
carried out using the Genant modified Sharp score, which is well documented in many clinical studies as a 
robust  tool.  According  to  the  results  of  the  long  term  follow-up  of  this  trial,  radiographic  progression 
remained stable over the observation period.  
Even though there are still some uncertainties regarding these results as no formal statistical analyses were 
performed  on  this  outcome  and  only  descriptive  statistics  were  available,  the  CHMP  agreed  that  overall 
abatacept treatment has a positive effect in reducing structural damage as the abatacept + MTX group had 
significantly  less  progression  in  structural  damage  compared  with  MTX  group  as  reflected  by  mean 
treatment difference of the abatacept + MTX group versus MTX group. Furthermore, a difference between 
the two treatment groups could be observed after 6 months of the complete drug withdrawal.         
Re-exposure 
During the re-exposure period all the 146 patients were treated with the combination (abatacept+MTX). 
Both DAS-remission rates and mean change from baseline values were comparable to those in the treatment 
period.  Remission  rates  and  mean  decrease  in  DAS-scores  were  similar  across  all  prior  treatment  arms 
confidence intervals overlapped.  
Withdrawal 
In  the  pivotal  study  it  was  shown  that  complete  withdrawal  of  all  study  medications  led  to  relapse  of 
remission in the majority of the patients, with the requested post hoc analyses showing  that  the  risk  of  
having  a  relapse  after drug withdrawal was  similar  across  the  three study groups. 
Comparison of abatacept with TNF-inhibitors 
Abatacept has been studied in 2 trials with anti-TNF agents as a reference arm or as a comparator.

Infliximab 
The ATTEST study (IM101043; Study V in the SmPC) examined the safety and efficacy of IV abatacept or 
infliximab relative to placebo, all on a background of MTX, in a MTX-IR population. Greater improvement (p 
< 0.001) in DAS28 was observed with abatacept and with infliximab compared to placebo at six months in 
the placebo controlled portion of the trial; the results between the abatacept and infliximab groups were 
similar. The ACR responses in Study V were consistent with the DAS28 score.  
Adalimumab 
The AMPLE study (IM101235; Study SC-II in the SmPC) compared, in a 2 year head-to-head study, the 
efficacy and safety of SC abatacept and adalimumab, with background MTX, in patients with moderate to 
severely active MTX-IR RA population with a mean disease duration of less than 2 years. 
The  primary  endpoint  showed  non-inferiority  (predefined  margin  of  12%)  of  ACR  20  response  after  12 
months  of  treatment,  64.8%  (206/318)  for  the  abatacept  SC  group  and  63.4%  (208/328)  for  the 
adalimumab  SC  group;  treatment  difference  was  1.8%  [95%  confidence  interval  (CI):    -5.6,  9.2],  with 
comparable responses throughout the 24-month period. The respective values for ACR 20 at 24 months 
were 59.7% (190/318) for the abatacept SC group and 60.1% (197/328) for the adalimumab SC group. The 
respective  values  for  ACR  50  and  ACR  70  at  12  months  and  24  months  were  consistent  and  similar  for 
abatacept and adalimumab. 
Across-study comparison (adalimumab, tocilizumab) 
The effect sizes  were mostly comparable amongst the different biologics, with the exception of a higher 
effect size of tocilizumab 8 mg/kg + MTX versus other biologics on the DAS28-CRP <2.6 measure. However, 
this difference is specific to this measure and the mechanism of action of tocilizumab (i.e. IL-6 antagonism 
that affects CRP more than other biologics), which is highlighted by the lack of differences on other endpoints 
(e.g. ACR scores or remission endpoints). Specifically, the effect size with abatacept + MTX versus MTX 
monotherapy in AVERT for SDAI and Boolean remission measures at Week 52 (17% and 15%, respectively) 
are similar to those observed with tocilizumab 8 mg/kg + MTX versus MTX in the FUNCTION trial (13.7% and 
10.2%,  respectively).  Despite  the  limitations  of  comparison  different  studies,  these  data  may  provide 
additional  evidence  that  when  used  in  combination  with  MTX,  abatacept,  adalimumab,  and  tocilizumab 
provide comparable efficacy in MTX-naive early RA patients. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The main study IM101226 (AVERT) has provided results which support a clinically meaningful efficacy of sc 
abatacept  in  combination  with  MTX  in  MTX-naïve  RA  population  with  highly  active  disease,  in  terms  of 
disease activity, physical function and structural damage of the joint. These results confirm the results of the 
previously submitted IM101023 study (AGREE, also in MTX-naïve, RA-patients). 
Furthermore, across-study comparisons of effect sizes in MTX-naïve population show that combination of 
MTX  with  abatacept,  adalimumab,  or  tocilizumab  provides  comparable  efficacy  in  MTX-naïve  early  RA 
patients. Despite the limitations of indirect comparisons between trials, these studies also provided some 
additional evidence of comparable efficacy of abatacept and TNFi in early, MTX-naïve RA population. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Abatacept has been studied in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis in placebo controlled clinical trials 
(2,111 patients with abatacept, 1,099 with placebo).The safety profile of abatacept is established and is 
characterised by several potentially serious consequences, including but not limited to the identified risk of 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/639090/2016 
Page 45/72 
 
  
  
infections  and  potential  risks  of  malignancies,  autoimmune  disorders,  local  injection  site  reactions  and 
immunogenicity. Pharmacovigilance activities aimed to further characterize the safety profile, as well as 
additional risk minimisation measure (Patient alert card) are in place from previous procedures.  
In  placebo  controlled  clinical  trials  with  abatacept,  adverse  reactions  (ARs)  were  reported  in  51.8%  of 
abatacept treated patients and 46.4% of placebo treated patients. The most frequently reported adverse 
reactions (≥ 5%) among abatacept treated patients were headache, nausea, and upper respiratory tract 
infections.  The  proportion  of  patients  who  discontinued  treatment  due  to  ARs  was  3.3%  for  abatacept 
treated patients and 2.0% for placebo treated patients. 
The  first  study  conducted  with  abatacept  in  RA  patients  not  previously  treated  with  methotrexate  was 
IM101023, using the IV formulation of abatacept. Over the 24-month study, 509 subjects received either 
combination therapy or MTX monotherapy for 12 months, followed by a 12-month open-label period. The 
results of study IM101023 were previously submitted and assessed in 2010 (EMA/H/C/00701/II/0033). 
Key  efficacy  and  safety  results  from  this  study  have  been  included  in  the  EU  Summary  of  Product 
Characteristics for Orencia (Study VI). 
Data supporting this extension of indication application are mainly from Study IM101226.  
Data from the three phases of the study (Treatment Period, Withdrawal Period and Re-exposure Period) are 
presented separately. 
Patient exposure 
During  the  Treatment  Period,  119  subjects  received  abatacept  +  MTX,  116  subjects  received  abatacept 
monotherapy, and 116 subjects received MTX monotherapy.  
The  Withdrawal  Period  included  225  subjects  (84  in  the  abatacept  +  MTX  group,  66  in  the  abatacept 
monotherapy group and 75 in the MTX monotherapy group). 
During  the  Re-exposure  period,  55,  48,  and  43  subjects  in  each  group,  respectively,  were  treated  with 
abatacept + MTX. The overall mean duration of exposure to SC abatacept during the Re-treatment Period 
was 7 months and similar in all groups. Subjects received a mean of 20.6 injections during this period. 
The overall Immunogenicity analysis population included 224 subjects treated with abatacept SC who had 
at least 1 immunogenicity sample taken during the study period (116 in the abatacept + MTX group and 
108 in the abatacept monotherapy group). 
Extent of exposure to all study medications during Treatment Period and Re-exposure Period in all treated 
subjects is presented in Table 16.

Table 16. Extent of exposure to all study medications during Treatment Period and Re-exposure Period in 
study IM101023 
Adverse events 
Across the entire study period, 299 of 351 subjects (85.2%) had at least 1 AE. The most common AEs across 
the full study period were Infections and Infestations, most commonly nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory 
tract infection, and urinary tract infection.  
Adverse Events During Treatment Period 
The overall frequency of AEs reported during the Treatment Period up to 56 days after the last dose of active 
drug was similar for the abatacept + MTX (85%), abatacept monotherapy (80%), and MTX monotherapy 
(83%) groups (Tables 17 and 18).

Table 18. AEs reported during Treatment Period in study IM101023- All Treated Subjects 
Similarly, the incidence rate of AEs was comparable across the 3 treatment groups for Months 0 to 6 of the 
Treatment Period (355.1, 349.5, and 400.0 per 100 p-y for the abatacept + MTX, abatacept monotherapy, 
and MTX monotherapy groups, respectively) and for Months 6 to 12 of the Treatment Period (178.4, 142.1, 
and 166.5 per 100 p-y, respectively)  
The most frequently reported AEs (≥ 5% of subjects in any treatment group) during the Treatment Period 
are summarised in Table 19 (frequency rates) and Table 20 (incidence rates).

Table 20. Exposure Adjusted Adverse Event (Occurring in at Least 5% of Treated Subjects in any Treatment 
Group) Summary 
In all treatment groups, most of the reported AEs in the Treatment Period were assessed by the investigators 
as mild or moderate in severity. Severe AEs  were reported for 7 subjects (6%) in the abatacept + MTX 
group,  11  subjects  (10%)  in  the  abatacept  monotherapy  group,  and  4  subjects  (3%)  in  the  MTX 
monotherapy group. No AE was assessed as very severe in intensity during the Treatment Period. 
The overall frequency of AEs reported during the Treatment Period that were assessed as related to study 
drug was similar for the abatacept + MTX (45%), abatacept monotherapy (41%), and MTX monotherapy 
(44%) groups. 
Severe,  related  AEs  during  the  Treatment  Period  were:  overdose  in  2  subjects,  and  toxicity  to  various 
agents, nausea, mucosal inflammation, headache, and pancytopenia in 1 subject each in the abatacept+ 
MTX  group,  myocarditis  post  infection  and  gamma  glutamyltransferase  increased  in  the  abatacept 
monotherapy group, and dry mouth and epistaxis in the MTX group. 
Adverse events during withdrawal period 
Among the 225 subjects who entered the Withdrawal Period, 46 subjects (20.4%) had at least 1 AE during 
the Withdrawal Period. The overall incidence rate for AEs during the entire Withdrawal Period was 25.5/100 
p-y.  
None of the AEs reported during the Withdrawal Period had a frequency of≥5%. 
Adverse events during the re-exposure period 
Among the 146 subjects who entered the Re-exposure Period, 59 subjects (40.4%) had at least 1 AE. The 
overall incidence rate for AEs during the entire Re-exposure Period was 37.3/100 p-y. Consistent with the AE 
profile during the Treatment Period, the most commonly reported events during the Re-exposure Period 
were infections and infestations, primarily, urinary tract infection, nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory 
tract infection. Among the AEs reported during the Re-exposure Period, only urinary tract infection (5.5% of 
subjects) had a total frequency of ≥5%.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious Adverse Events 
Across  the  full  study  period,  11  subjects  (9.2%),  15  subjects  (12.9%),  and  15  subjects  (12.9%)  in  the 
abatacept + MTX group, the MTX monotherapy group, and the MTX monotherapy groups, respectively, had 
at least 1 SAE (Table 21). Most of the SAEs occurred during the Treatment Period. 
Table 21. Serious Adverse events reported during full study Period in study IM101023- All Treated Subjects 
Serious adverse events during the treatment period 
During the Treatment Period, 31 of 351 subjects (9%) had at least 1 SAE. The percentage of subjects with 
SAEs was higher in the abatacept monotherapy group (14 subjects [12%]) than in the abatacept + MTX 
group (8 subjects [7%]) and MTX monotherapy group (9 subjects [8%]). 
Overdose  was  the  only  individual  SAE  that  was  reported by  >  1  subject  in  any  treatment  group  (i.e.,  3 
subjects in the abatacept + MTX group and 1 subject each in the other 2 groups). Two reports of serious 
overdose in the abatacept + MTX group during the Treatment Period were assessed by the investigators as 
related to study drug, and both were related to an overdose of oral MTX. 
Related serious adverse events 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/639090/2016 
Page 50/72 
 
  
  
 
 
Seven  subjects  had  SAEs  during  the  Treatment  Period  that  were  considered  by  the  investigators  to  be 
related to the study drug (3 each in the abatacept + MTX and abatacept monotherapy groups and 1 in the 
MTX monotherapy group). For 5 subjects, the related SAEs led to discontinuation of study drugs during the 
Treatment  Period.  All  related  SAEs  resolved  either  following  discontinuation  from  the  study  and/or 
therapeutic intervention: 
• Abatacept + MTX group - pancytopenia/increased hepatic enzymes in 1 subject and MTX overdose in 2 
subjects 
• Abatacept monotherapy group - Bowen’s disease, myocarditis post infection, and herpes zoster infection in 
1 subject each 
• MTX monotherapy group - increased hepatic enzymes in 1 subject. 
Serious adverse events during the withdrawal period 
Seven of 225 subjects (3.1%) who entered the Withdrawal Period had a SAE with an onset > 56days after 
the last dose of active drug in the Treatment Period up to the start of the Re-exposure Period (2 subjects in 
the  abatacept  +  MTX  group  and  5  subjects  in  the  MTX  monotherapy  group).  None  of  the  SAEs  were 
considered by the investigators to be related to the study drug. One of these SAEs (uterine neoplasm) in the 
MTX monotherapy group resulted in discontinuation from the study and subsequently, death. Other than this 
event, none of the SAEs reported during the Withdrawal Period led to discontinuation from the study, and all 
but 2 SAEs (post-procedure complication of hepatopathy following cholecystectomy and prostate cancer) 
had resolved prior to database lock 
Serious adverse events during the re-exposure period 
Four of 146 subjects who  entered the Re-exposure Period had had an SAE. One of the SAEs (abatacept 
overdose) was considered by the investigators to be related to the study drug. 
Other significant adverse events 
In the following sections, AEs of special interest have been prospectively identified to be those that may be 
associated with the use of immunomodulatory agents. They are a subset of all AEs and may be either serious 
or non-serious.  
Infections 
Treatment Period 
A similar percentage of subjects in each treatment group had an infection up to 56 days after the last dose 
of  active  drug  in  the  Treatment  Period:  57%,  55%,  and  60%  in  the  abatacept  +  MTX,  abatacept 
monotherapy, and MTX monotherapy groups, respectively. 
Nasopharyngitis was the most frequently reported infection in all 3 treatment groups, reported for 17% to 
22% of subjects across the 3 groups. All reported infection and infestation AEs during the Treatment Period 
were mild or moderate in severity, except for 3 events in 2 subjects the abatacept monotherapy group (viral 
infection, abscess limb and furuncle). 
During the Treatment Period, the incidence rate of infections was similar for the abatacept + MTX, abatacept 
monotherapy, and MTX monotherapy groups during both Months 0 to 6 (116.6, 126.1, and 110.7 per 100 
p-y, respectively). From Months 6 to 12, the incidence rate of infections decreased (64.6, 66.5, and 72.8 per 
100 p-y, respectively). 
Serious infections during the Treatment Period were reported for 1 subject in the abatacept + MTX group 
(pneumonia) and in 4 subjects (3%) in the abatacept monotherapy group (pneumonia, abscess limb, herpes 
zoster,  viral  infection).  With  the  exception  of  the  serious  herpes  zoster  infection,  none  of  the  serious 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/639090/2016 
Page 51/72 
 
  
  
infections during the Treatment Period was assessed as related to study drug. 
Only a single infection-related AE led to discontinuation during the Treatment Period; this event (herpes 
zoster in abatacept monotherapy group) was serious. 
Withdrawal Period 
Twenty-four of 225 subjects (11%) who entered the Withdrawal Period had infections reported with an onset 
> 56 days after the last dose of active drug in the Treatment Period up to the start of the Re-exposure Period. 
These  subjects  were  distributed  across  the  abatacept  +  MTX,  abatacept  monotherapy,  and  MTX 
monotherapy groups (n = 8 [10%], n = 6 [9%], and n = 10 [13%], respectively).  
The overall incidence of infections during the Withdrawal Period was 8.1 per 100 person years (6.5, 5.4, and 
12.2 per 100 person years for the abatacept + MTX, abatacept monotherapy, and MTX monotherapy groups, 
respectively) (Table S.6.41). 
Overall, the most common infections during the Withdrawal Period were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory 
tract infection, urinary tract infection (2.2% each), and gastroenteritis (1.3%). All other infections during 
the  Withdrawal  Period  were  reported  for  <1%  of  subjects.  Upper  respiratory  tract  infection  and 
nasopharyngitis  (2%  each)  were  the  only  related  infections  reported  in  >  1%  of  subjects  during  the 
Withdrawal Period. 
All infections were mild or moderate in intensity with the exception of 1 event of pyelonephritis in a subject 
in the MTX monotherapy group. This event was also serious. 
A  serious  event  of  urinary  tract  infection  was  also  reported  during  the  Withdrawal  Period.  No  subject 
discontinued from the study due to an infection during the Withdrawal Period. 
Re-exposure Period 
A  total  of  37  of  146  subjects  (25.3%)  who  entered  the  Re-exposure  Period  had  infections  during  the 
Re-exposure Period. The overall incidence of infections during the Re-exposure Period was 16.1/100 p-y. 
Overall, the most common infections during the Re-exposure Period were urinary tract infection (5.5%), 
nasopharyngitis (4.8%), upper respiratory tract infection (3.4%), and bronchitis, conjunctivitis, folliculitis, 
influenza, and pharyngitis (1.4% each). All other infections during the Re-exposure Period were reported for 
< 1% of subjects.  
All infections were mild or moderate in intensity with the exception of 1 event of bronchitis. No subject was 
discontinued from the study due to an infection during the Re-exposure Period. 
Malignancies 
Treatment Period 
Four malignancies were reported during the Treatment Period, 1 in the abatacept + MTX group (basal cell 
carcinoma), 2 in the abatacept monotherapy group (Bowen’s disease and pulmonary carcinoid tumour), and 
1 in the MTX monotherapy group (invasive ductal breast carcinoma). 
All malignancies were reported as SAEs; the event of Bowen’s disease was considered by the investigator to 
be related to the study drug. 
During  the  Treatment  Period,  the  incidence  rate  for  malignancies  was  1.8  per  100  person  years  for  the 
abatacept monotherapy and MTX monotherapy groups during Months 0 to 6 and was 1.0 per 100 person 
years each for the abatacept + MTX and abatacept monotherapy groups during Months 6 to 12. 
Withdrawal Period 
Two subjects who entered the Withdrawal Period had a malignancy with an onset > 56 days after the last 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/639090/2016 
Page 52/72 
 
  
  
dose of active drug in the Treatment Period up to the start of the Re-exposure Period. The overall incidence 
of malignancies during the Withdrawal Period was 0.8 per 100 person years. 
One subject in the MTX monotherapy group had a uterine neoplasm that resulted in death. This malignancy 
occurred during the first 6 months of the Withdrawal Period (Months 12 to 18). 
One  subject  in  the  abatacept  +  MTX  group  had  a  benign  keratoacanthoma  on  the  left  ear  and  prostate 
cancer. Both events occurred during the second 6 months of the Withdrawal Period (i.e., > Month 18). These 
malignancies were not considered by the investigators to be related to the study drug. 
Re-exposure Period 
No subject had an event of malignancy during the Re-exposure Period. 
Post-study Period 
Two  malignancies  were  reported  during  the  post-study  period  (i.e.,  >  56  days  after  the  subject  was 
withdrawn from the study). Uterine cancer was reported in 1 subject in the MTX monotherapy group and 
lung adenocarcinoma was reported in 1 subject in the abatacept + MTX group. 
Autoimmune Disorders  
Treatment Period 
Six  subjects  had  pre-specified  autoimmune  disorder  AEs  during  the  Treatment  Period  (1  subject  in  the 
abatacept  +  MTX  group,  2  subjects  in  the  abatacept  monotherapy  group,  and  3  subjects  in  the  MTX 
monotherapy group. 
The incidence rate for pre-specified autoimmune disorders was 1.8 per 100 person years and 3.6 per 100 
person years for the abatacept monotherapy and MTX monotherapy groups, respectively, during Months 0 
to 6, and was 2.0 per 100 person years for the abatacept monotherapy group and 1.0 per 100 person years 
each for the abatacept + MTX and MTX monotherapy groups during Months 6 to 12. 
The autoimmune disorders reported during the Treatment Period among abatacept-exposed subjects were 
mild  Raynaud’s  phenomenon  in  the  abatacept  +  MTX  group,  and  moderate  Sjögren’s  syndrome  and 
moderate psoriasis in the abatacept monotherapy group. 
The latter event was the only autoimmune disorder reported during the Treatment Period that was assessed 
as related to study drug. None of the reported autoimmune disorder events was serious and none resulted 
in discontinuation of study drug. 
Withdrawal Period 
One subject in the MTX group had an autoimmune disorder (pre-specified) of scleritis during the Withdrawal 
Period. The event was considered severe in intensity and not related to study drug. 
Re-exposure Period 
No autoimmune disorders (pre-specified) were reported during the Re-exposure Period.  
Local Injection Site Reactions (Pre-specified) 
During the Treatment Period, 3 pre-specified local injection site reactions were reported for 2 subjects in the 
abatacept + MTX group only (mild injection site swelling). These events were non-serious and all resolved 
within 1 day while the subjects remained in the study. 
The incidence rate for these events was 2.9 per 100 person years for the abatacept + MTX group during 
Months 6 to 12; no local injection site reactions were reported during Months 0 to 6 of the Treatment Period. 
No local injection site reactions (pre-specified) occurred during the Re-exposure Period.

Deaths 
Two deaths occurred during the study (both in the MTX monotherapy group and both after discontinuation 
from  the  Withdrawal  Period).  One  subject  underwent  total  abdominal  hysterectomy  because  of  uterine 
cancer on Day471. Uterine cancer event was thought to be resolved. On Day 475 the subject died due to 
respiratory failure.  
Another subject died on Day 470 due to uterine neoplasm and renal failure. 
Laboratory findings 
During the Treatment Period, the frequencies of hematologic and blood chemistry parameters that met the 
sponsor-defined criteria for a marked abnormality, was small (typically < 5%), and generally similar across 
the 3 treatment groups. 
Marked  abnormalities  in  hematology  and  clinical  chemistry  parameters  were  also  infrequently  reported 
during the Withdrawal Period, with the most frequent abnormalities consisting of abnormalities in serum 
glucose (9% of total subjects with marked reduction, and 2% of total subjects with marked elevation). 
Marked  abnormalities  in  hematology  and  clinical  chemistry  parameters  were  infrequent  during  the  Re 
exposure Period and were consistent with the incidence observed during the Treatment Period.  
Safety in special populations 
There were only 3 subjects whose ages were 75 years or over in the TP and no subjects 85 years or older. 
26 subjects (7.4%) were in the 65-74 years  subgroup. No unexpected AEs were reported in the elderly 
subpopulations. 
Exposure during pregnancy 
Five pregnancies were reported among the study participants. For 3 subjects, the pregnancy resulted in 
discontinuation  of  study  treatment.  In  two  cases,  no  information  was  avaialble  on  the  outcome  of  the 
preganacy. In the other three cases, the outcome was reported as delivery of  healthy, full-term infants. 
Immunological events 
The abatacept-associated immunogenicity rates at each assessment time during the treatment, withdrawal, 
and re-exposure periods are summarized by treatment group and type of seropositive response (CTLA4 and 
possibly Ig or Ig and/or junction region, and combined) in Table 22. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/639090/2016

Table 22. Proportion of subjects with positive abatacept-induced responses (ECL Method) Over Time During 
Study Period - Immunogenicity Population 
At  TP  Day  365,  the  combined  immunogenicity  rates  were  2.9%  and  5%  in  the  abatacept  +  MTX  and 
abatacept monotherapy group, respectively. These low rates and low titers during the treatment period were 
consistent with rates previously observed in the abatacept SC program. 
During  the  Withdrawal  Period,  29  of  77  subjects  (37.7%)  in  the  abatacept  +  MTX  group  and  26  of  59  
subjects  (44.1%)  in  the  abatacept  monotherapy  group  with  samples  assessed  had  positive responses 
to CTLA4 and possibly Ig or IG and/or junction region. In the Re-exposure Period, 7 of 53 subjects (13.2%) 
in  the  abatacept  +  MTX  group  and  6  of  45  subjects  (13.3%)  in  the  abatacept  monotherapy  group  had 
positive responses.  
For most subjects with abatacept-induced seropositive CLTLA4 and possibly Ig responses, titers were low (< 
100); only 6 subjects had CTLA4 and possibly Ig titers of > 200. For many subjects, abatacept-induced 
seropositivity  was  observed  at  only  a  single  time  point  and  was  followed  by  at  least  1  sample  that  was 
negative for anti-abatacept antibodies. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Across  the  full  study  period,  3.4%,  6.9%,  and  6.0%  of  subjects  in  the  abatacept  +  MTX,  abatacept 
monotherapy, and MTX monotherapy groups, respectively, had an AE that led to discontinuation from the 
study. 
During the Treatment Period, 17 subjects (5%) had AEs leading to the discontinuation of study drug. The 
percentage of subjects who had AEs leading to the discontinuation of study drug was similar across the 3 
groups (4 subjects [3%] in the abatacept + MTX group, 8 subjects [7%] in the abatacept monotherapy 
group, and 5 subjects [4%] in the MTX group). 
Overall, overdose was the most common AE leading to discontinuation (1 subject in each treatment group), 
and each of these 3 events was considered serious. No other individual AE leading to discontinuation of study 
therapy occurred in > 1 subject across the 3 treatment groups. All AEs leading to discontinuation during the 
Treatment  Period  in  the  abatacept  +  MTX  group  resolved.  All  but  1  AE  leading  to  discontinuation  in  the

Two  of  225  subjects  (1%)  (both  in  the  MTX  monotherapy  group)  who  entered  the  Withdrawal  Period 
discontinued  study  drug  due  to  an  AE.  The  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  were  uterine  neoplasm 
(subsequently  resulting  in  death)  and  nausea  in  1  subject  each.  Neither  AE  occurred  within  the  first  6 
months of the Withdrawal Period (i.e., Months 12 to 18). 
No subjects in the Re-exposure group had AEs leading to the discontinuation of study drug.

Analysis of Adverse Events 
No new safety signals were evident in either study during the long-term use of abatacept in combination with 
MTX for up to 18 months of treatment in study IM101226 (Treatment and Re-exposure Periods) and up to 24 
months in study IM101023 (Blind plus Open-label Periods). The types of AEs observed were similar across 
periods for both studies. 
The overall AE summaries for both studies are presented in Table 24.

the blinded period pf treatment in IMI01023-All treated subjects 
Deaths 
Study IM101226 
Two deaths occurred during the study (both in the MTX monotherapy group during the Withdrawal Period). 
Neither death was considered by the investigator to be related to study treatment (Table 3.2-1). One subject 
died on Day 475 due to respiratory failure after hysterectomy by reason of uterine cancer and 1 subject died 
on Day 470 due to uterine neoplasm and renal failure. 
Study IM101023 
Deaths were reported in 2 subjects (0.8%) in the abatacept + MTX group and 4 subjects (1.6%) in the 
placebo + MTX group in the first 12 months of the study (Table 3.2-2). The deaths in the abatacept + MTX 
group were considered by the investigator as probably related to study drug. Two (2) of the subjects who 
died in the placebo + MTX group were reported to have discontinued due to an AE. 
In the open-label period, there were 2 deaths (1 in the original abatacept + MTX group; 1 in the original 
placebo + MTX group; Table 3.2-2). These 2 deaths were the result of SAEs reported in the open-label period 
that were considered possibly related to study drug by the investigator (pneumonia, and pneumonia with 
septic shock). 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
All reported SAEs are summarised for studies IM101226 and IM101023 in Tables 25, 26 and 27.

Events Leading to Discontinuation in Study IM101226 
Across  the  full  study  period,  3.4%,  6.9%,  and  6.0%  of  subjects  in  the  abatacept  +  MTX,  abatacept 
monotherapy, and MTX monotherapy groups, respectively, had an AE that led to discontinuation from the 
study. 
Treatment Period 
During the Treatment Period, 17 subjects (5%) had AEs leading to the discontinuation of study drug. The 
percentage of subjects who had AEs leading to the  discontinuation of study drug was similar across the 
abatacept+MTX and MTX groups (4 subjects [3%] in the abatacept + MTX group, and 5 subjects [4%] in the 
MTX group). 8 subjects [7%] in the abatacept monotherapy group had AEs leading to discontinuation. 
Overall, overdose was the most common AE leading to discontinuation (1 subject in each treatment group), 
and each of these 3 events was considered serious. 
No  other  individual  AE  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study  therapy  occurred  in>  1  subject  across  all  3 
treatment groups. 
All AEs leading to discontinuation during the Treatment Period in the abatacept + MTX group resolved.

All but 1 AE leading to discontinuation in the abatacept monotherapy group (emphysema) and 2 AEs leading 
to  discontinuation  in  the  MTX  monotherapy  group  (hypertension  and  invasive  ductal  breast  carcinoma) 
resolved by the cutoff date. 
One subject in the abatacept + MTX group was discontinued from the study due to AEs (anemia and weight 
decreased) that had onsets prior to randomization (Day -5) and thus were not treatment emergent. 
Withdrawal Period 
During the Withdrawal Period, 2 of 225 subjects (1%; both in the MTX monotherapy group) discontinued 
study drug due to an AE. AEs leading to discontinuation were uterine neoplasm (subsequently resulting in 
death) and nausea in 1 subject each (both occurring after Month 18). 
Re-exposure Period 
No subjects in the Re-exposure group had AEs leading to the discontinuation of study drug. 
Events Leading to Discontinuation in Study IM101023 
Blinded Period (First Year) 
The proportion of subjects who discontinued due to an AE was low in both treatment groups (abatacept + 
MTX: 3.1%; placebo + MTX: 4.3%). A small number of subjects in each group were discontinued from the 
study due to a SAE (1.2% of subjects each in the abatacept + MTX and placebo + MTX groups)  
Open-label Period (Second Year) 
In the open-label period, 11 (2.4%) subjects (4 in the original abatacept + MTX group; 7 in the original 
placebo + MTX group) discontinued treatment due to an AE or multiple AEs. 4 of these subjects had AE(s) 
that were considered serious and 5 of these subjects had AEs that were considered related to study therapy. 
There was no pattern in the AEs that led to discontinuation; no individual AE resulted in the discontinuation 
of more than 1 subject. 
Two of these subjects died as a result of the AE. 
Post marketing experience 
To assess the safety of abatacept prescribed as first line therapy using real world data, the MAH analysed 
two US data sources, (as abatacept is approved as first line therapy for the treatment of RA in the US) with 
the objective of comparing the risk of pre-specified events among patients initiating abatacept and TNFi as 
the first line biologic. The data sources selected for these analyses included MarketScan Commercial and 
Supplemental  Medicare  (MarketScan)  [Study  IM101488]  and  the  National  Data  Bank  for  Rheumatic 
Diseases (NDB) [Study IM101045B].  
In  Study  IM101488,  adult  subjects  diagnosed  with  RA  who  initiated  treatment  with  abatacept  or  a  TNFi 
between July 1, 2006 and July 31, 2012 were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. Patients were defined as 
having first line therapy if a claim for abatacept or a TNFi was made without having a claim for a biologic drug 
during the 180 day period prior to the abatacept or TNFi claim. 
In Study IM101045B, adult subjects with RA who completed a comprehensive follow-up questionnaire after 
2005 and who initiated treatment with abatacept or a TNFi were eligible for inclusion in the analysis. First line 
was defined as the initiation of abatacept or a TNFi without reported prior use of a biologic. 
In Study IM101488, propensity scores were estimated by logistic regression analyses to measure potential 
predictors of therapy initiation, including age, gender, year of therapy initiation, and select co-morbidities 
and medications prescribed in the 180 days prior to treatment initiation. A Cox regression analysis, adjusted 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/639090/2016 
Page 59/72 
 
  
  
for propensity score and unbalanced predictors (i.e., cardiovascular disease), was conducted to compare the 
2 cohorts. These results were reported as adjusted hazard ratios. 
In  Study  IM101045B,  marginal  structural  models  were  used  to  estimate  the  effect  of  treatment  on  the 
outcome by an appropriate control for the effects of time-dependent confounders. Variables included sex, 
employment status, marital status, smoking status, education level, income, and select co-morbidities, and 
medications prescribed. These results were reported as adjusted HRs. 
Baseline Characteristics 
In Study IM101488, there were 5,808 patients exposed to abatacept and 28,091 patients exposed to TNFi. 
Patients prescribed abatacept first line were older (mean age 56.5 vs 52.7) and more likely to have had a 
claim  for  hypertension,  diabetes,  hospitalized  infections,  malignancy,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary 
disease,  asthma,  and  chronic  kidney  disease  in  the  180  days  before  treatment  initiation  compared  to 
patients prescribed a TNFi first line. Abatacept patients were also more likely to have been prescribed a 
non-biologic  DMARD,  IV  antibiotics  and  corticosteroids  during  the  180  days  before  treatment  initiation 
compared to TNFi patients. 
In Study IM101045B, there were 348 patients exposed to abatacept and 2,740 patients exposed to TNFi. 
Patients prescribed abatacept first line were older (mean age 62.5 vs 57.9), more likely to have had a history 
of smoking, have had hypertension and diabetes and have used prednisone compared to patients prescribed 
a TNFi first line. 
Hazard Ratios 
The hazard ratios for the pre-specified events in both studies are summarised in Table 28.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data in MTX-naive RA population from the pivotal study IM101226 (119 patients on sc abatacept + 
MTX, 116 on sc abatacept, 116 on MTX) and the supportive study IM101023 (256 patients on iv abatacept 
+ MTX, 253 on MTX) were submitted in support of this application.  
The use of previous IV abatacept (+MTX) data to support the safety of this combination in this larger early 
RA patient population not previously treated with MTX  was considered appropriate, however, as the study 
designs differed considerably, only overall AE profiles were comparable. 
The overall frequency of AEs reported during the Treatment Period in study IM101226 was similar for the 
abatacept + MTX (85%), abatacept monotherapy (80%), and MTX monotherapy (83%) groups. The most 
common AEs were nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory infections and urinary tract infections. Nausea was 
more  common  in  subjects  with  MTX  use  (abatacept  +  MTX  group,  MTX  group)  compared  to  abatacept 
monotherapy.    
The  overall  frequency  of  AEs  in  study  IM101226  was  also  comparable  to  that  reported  from  the  study 
IM101023 during the first year treatment [(abatacept + MTX (85%), MTX monotherapy (83%)].  
When  comparison  between  studies  was  performed,  the  proportion  of  subjects  with  SAEs  and  serious 
infections at 1 year were also very similar:  
SAEs: 7% in abatacept + MTX and 8% in MTX monotherapy (IM101226) vs. 8% abatacept + MTX and 8% 
in MTX monotherapy (IM101023), respectively. 
Serious infections: 1% in abatacept + MTX and 1% in MTX monotherapy (IM101226) vs. 2% abatacept + 
MTX and 2% in MTX monotherapy (IM101023), respectively. 
The frequencies of other relevant safety parameters such as the number of related AEs, and the incidence of 
AEs of special interest were also similar in the pivotal study and in line with previous experience of Orencia. 
Three subjects each in the abatacept + MTX and abatacept monotherapy groups and 1 subject in the MTX 
monotherapy group had SAEs during the Treatment Period that were considered related to study treatment 
by  the  investigators.  All  related  SAEs  resolved  either  following  discontinuation  from  the  study  and/or 
therapeutic intervention. 
No deaths were reported with abatacept at any time during the study. Two deaths were reported with MTX 
(respiratory failure after hysterectomy by reason of uterine cancer in 1 subject and uterine neoplasm and 
acute renal failure in 1 subject) during the Withdrawal Period. 
A  similar  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  abatacept  +  MTX  and  MTX  monotherapy  groups  (3%  and  4%, 
respectively)  were  discontinued  from  the  Treatment  Period  due  to  AEs;  in  the  abatacept  monotherapy 
group, however, 7% of subjects were discontinued due to an AE during the Treatment Period. 
The  frequencies  of  AEs  of  clinical  interest  such  as  infections,  malignancies,  autoimmune  disorders  and 
injection-related events were also comparable between different treatment groups in the pivotal study. 
Four malignancies were reported during the Treatment Period, including 1 in the abatacept + MTX group 
(basal  cell  carcinoma),  2  in  the  abatacept  monotherapy  group  (Bowen’s  disease,  carcinoid  tumor 
pulmonary), and 1 in the MTX monotherapy group (invasive ductal breast carcinoma). Furthermore, two 
other malignancies occurred during the Withdrawal Period: one uterine cancer and one uterine neoplasm 
event, both leading to death of the subject concerned. 
Pre-specified  autoimmune  disorder  AEs  were  reported  during  the  Treatment  Period  for  1  subject  in  the 
abatacept  +  MTX  group,  2  subjects  in  the  abatacept  monotherapy  group,  and  3  subjects  in  the  MTX 
monotherapy  group.  None  of  these  events  was  a  SAE  or  resulted  in  discontinuation  of  study  drug. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/639090/2016 
Page 61/72 
 
  
  
Pre-specified local injection site reactions were reported for 2 subjects (2%) in the abatacept + MTX group 
only (mild injection site swelling). Each event was nonserious and resolved within 1 day. 
Subjects with RA are thought to have a higher rate of infection than non-RA subjects (Doran et al, 2002). 
Literature data also suggest that subjects with increased RA disease activity have a higher rate of serious 
infection  than  subjects  with  lower  disease  activity  (Emery  et  al,  2014),  and  an  increased  rate  also  for 
infections  with  increased  DAS28  parameters  (Favalli  et  al,  2009).  It  is  also  known  that  systemic 
corticosteroid use increases susceptibility to infections. With decreasing disease activity, corticosteroid dose 
can also be decreased, which might result in a decrease in the infection rate. Therefore it is reasonable to 
suggest that the observed increased risk of infections in the Treatment Period compared to Re-Exposure 
Period could be due to the disease itself, the level of disease activity, and the associated therapies (Emery 
et al, 2014). 
The  safety  profiles  of  abatacept  in  combination  with  MTX  in  studies  IM101226  and  IM1010123  were 
consistent  with  previous  clinical  experience  in  MTX-IR  and  TNF-IR  subjects,  and  with  the  known  safety 
profile of abatacept, as characterized in the abatacept Risk Management Plan. 
Safety results from study IM101226 thus confirmed those observed previously in study IM101023, and no 
new clinically important safety issues were identified.  
The unique design of study IM101226 provides new safety information for both SC abatacept in combination 
with MTX and as monotherapy in subjects with early, active RA. While the abatacept monotherapy group had 
a numerically somewhat higher frequency of SAEs, including serious infections, these numbers are too small 
to suggest a clinically relevant difference. 
In study IM101023, similar immunogenicity rates were seen in patients on treatment for the abatacept+ 
MTX, and abatacept monotherapy groups (2.9% (3/103) and 5.0% (5/101), respectively) during the 
double-blind 12 month period. Increased rates of immunogenicity were observed in subjects tested during 
6 months of complete drug withdrawal in the abatacept + MTX and abatacept monotherapy groups (37.7% 
[29/77] and 44.1% [27/59], respectively) with generally low titer antibody responses. No clinical impact of 
these antibody responses was detected, and no safety concerns were observed upon re-initiation of 
abatacept therapy. 
Of the 55 patients who developed ADAs, during the withdrawal period, eleven patients reported AEs, two of 
which  were  potentially  immune-mediated.  Both  patients  entered  the  re-treatment  without  further 
problems and achieved a treatment response.  
Impact of ADAs on efficacy was reviewed by analysing the treatment responses in 8 patients with ADAs 
during treatment period. With the exception of one patient, all achieved a treatment response. 
Impact of ADAs during re-treatment period (RP): Forty-six patients who had ADAs during the withdrawal 
period (WP) entered the re-treatment period. There was a significant treatment effect (DAS28-CRP). The 
response  was  numerically  higher  in  the  abatacept  +  methotrexate  group.  The  treatment  response  and 
likelihood of re-gaining the original level of response were similar in the ADA-positive group and the whole 
RP-group. Seventeen out of 46 ADA-positive patients reported AEs during re-treatment period. Two events 
(severe  pruritus  and  mild  urticaria)  were  possibly  immune-mediated  but  did  not  lead  to  permanent 
withdrawal from abatacept-treatment. No autoimmune disorders were reported. 
Post-marketing data were also submitted fromt he US to assess any potential differecnes in the safety of 
abastacept when used as first line therapy in RA. The two studies (IM10148 and IM101045B) submitted 
reported on the adjusted hazard rations of various types of infections and malignancies.  
In Study IM101488, the crude HR was significantly elevated in the abatacept cohort for total malignancy and 
breast cancer but this risk was attenuated and lost significance after adjustment for propensity score and 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

cardiovascular  disease.  The  crude  HR  for  lung  cancer  was  also  elevated  in  the  abatacept  cohort but  not 
significantly and the risk was further attenuated after adjustment for propensity score and cardiovascular 
disease.  
In Study IM101045B, the crude HR for abatacept was non-significantly elevated for total malignancy and 
NMSC and was attenuated after adjustment for multiple variables. There were no events of breast cancer or 
lymphoma among the abatacept treated patients so models could not be run for these outcomes. 
In both studies, the crude HR for comparing patients prescribed abatacept to patients prescribed a TNFi was 
not statistically different for hospitalized infections.  
Overall, the submitted post-marketing data were consistent with the known safety profile for abatacept from 
the clinical trial experience, with no new signal identified with first line use. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The  safety  profile  of  abatacept  is  well  established  and  is  characterised  by  several  potentially  serious 
consequences, including but not limited to the identified risk of infections and potential risks of malignancies, 
autoimmune  disorders,  local  injection  site  reactions  and  immunogenicity.  Risk  minimisation  as  well  as 
pharmacovigilance activities are in place from previous procedures. Based on the data currently available, 
the adverse event incidence and profile of abatacept in MTX-naive RA-population appears consistent with the 
previous experience with abatacept. There were a slightly higher numbers of serious infections reported in 
the abatacept monotherapy group, but there was no consistent pattern that emerged in a specific infection 
or  group  of  infections  that  had  a  larger  probability  to  occur  in  the  abatacept  treatment  group.  No  such 
increase in serious infections was seen in the combination arm relative to the MTX alone arm.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The next data lock point will be 22 December 2016.  
The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 20.1 is acceptable. No changes to the safety 
concerns, pharmacovigilance plan or risk minimisation measures have been made. The PRAC endorsed PRAC 
Rapporteur assessment report is attached. 
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of Annex 
I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be submitted to 
h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu.

2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
•  Consultation with target patient groups on the Package Leaflet has been performed at the occasion 
of the original Marketing Authorization Application of ORENCIA powder for concentrate for solution 
for infusion for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (EC Decision received on 21 May 2007). 
• 
The readability of the ORENCIA solution for injection Package Leaflet has been tested at the occasion 
of the Extension Application for sc. injection (EC Decision received on 4 October 2012). 
•  Only limited changes (i.e. those relevant to the new indication) are made to the Package Leaflet, the 
routes of administration and the safety profile remain the same. 
•  Administration of ORENCIA powder for concentrate for solution for infusion is done by a health care 
professional. The instructions for dose calculation, preparation, administration, storage and disposal 
that are currently reflected in the approved PL remain unchanged. 
• 
The general design and layout of the proposed PL has not changed compared to the tested ones. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The pivotal study IM101226 demonstrated that s.c. treatment with abatacept + MTX provides a clinically 
significant benefit in MTX-naïve RA patients with highly active disease, in terms of sustained remission, in 
comparison with MTX monotherapy (remission rates, defined DAS28-CRP < 2.6, at month 12): 60.9 % vs 
45.2 % for abatacept+ MTX compared to MTX alone, OR (95% CI) 2.01 (1.18 3.43), p<0.01). Results from 
the supportive study IM101023 with iv abatacept showed similar results (remission at 12 months in 41.4% 
vs 23.3% of patients in abatacept + MTX vs MTX groups, p<0.001). 
Descriptive  results  on  most  of  the  secondary  endpoints  in  both  studies  also  favoured  numerically  the 
abatacept + MTX group. 
In  the  main  study  the  treatment  with  abatacept  +  MTX  was  associated  with  a  smaller  progression  in 
structural damage, as reflected by mean post baseline MRI erosion score, and larger improvements in MRI 
osteitis and synovitis scores at Month 12 compared with the MTX monotherapy group (treatment differences 
= -1.22, 95% CI = [-2.20, -0.25], -1.43, 95% CI = [-2.68, -0.18], and 1.60, 95% CI = [-2.42, -0.78], 
respectively). In the supportive study evaluation of joint damage using the Genant modified Sharp score 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/639090/2016 
Page 68/72 
 
  
  
 
(X-ray) demonstrated less progression in structural damage in the patients treated with abatacept + MTX 
than in the MTX-group: the mean change from baseline in radiographic total score and erosion score in 
abatacept + MTX group was 0.63 and 0.50 respectively and in MTX group 1.06 and 0.89 (p=0.040). 
Further, a small, but significantly greater number of subjects achieved drug-free, DAS-defined remission at 
both 12 months of treatment and following 6 months withdrawal of RA treatment (co-primary endpoint) in 
the  initial  abatacept  +  MTX  group  compared  to  the MTX  group.  A  total  of  26%  of  subjects  who  were  in 
remission  at  one  year  were  able  to  maintain  remission  after  6  months  of  drug  withdrawal  and  12%  of 
subjects maintained remission for 12 months after drug withdrawal. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Although the analysis on the second co-primary endpoint (remission at 12 and at 18 months) showed similar 
results to those on the first co-primary endpoint in the pivotal study, an overall lower magnitude in efficacy 
rate  was  seen  and  results  of  the  analysis  were  only  of  borderline  significance.  Thus,  for  the  majority  of 
patients complete withdrawal of all study medications led to relapse of remission, with the requested post 
hoc analyses showing  that  the  risk  of  having  a  relapse  after drug withdrawal was  similar  across  the  
three study groups. 
Overall, the results of the secondary outcome variables appeared to support those of the analysis on the 
co-primary  endpoint  with  clinically  relevant  changes,  but  it  should  be  noted  that  no  formal  statistical 
analyses were provided on any of these variables; only descriptive statistics was available.  
Although at an average the study sample comprised patients with high RA disease activity as defined by the 
EULAR DAS28-CRP criterion of 5.2 and higher, the inclusion criteria targeted RA patients with a disease 
activity of > 3.2. High proportions of patients in both studies had the highest degree of severity, as defined 
by the EULAR criteria, (approximately 60 %, at an average 5.4 in the pivotal; over 80% in the supportive 
study). The remainder had moderate disease activity.  
A  subgroup  analysis  in  study  IM101226,  based  on  levels  of  disease  activity  showed    that  the  primary 
outcome, DAS28-CRP  remission  at  Month  12 (proportion)  was  higher  in  the SC abatacept + MTX group 
compared to the MTX group, regardless of the level of disease activity at baseline.  The estimated difference 
in response rates was similar in both subgroups of moderate and high disease activity, reflecting a similar 
benefit  in  the  two  populations.  The  post  hoc  analyses  showed  similar  results  for  the  supportive  study 
IM101023.  
Classification of RA according to the 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria was lacking and not an inclusion criterion in 
study IM101226. However, it was concluded that the inclusion criteria of the pivotal study correlated well 
with the ACR/EULAR criteria. This together with the diagnosis of early RA from the treating rheumatologist 
was  considered  strong  enough  evidence  that  the  target  population  was  appropriately  diagnosed  and 
classified with RA.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Studies  IM101226  and  IM101223  provide  2  years  of  exposure  to  abatacept  +  MTX  in  each  study, 
demonstrating the long-term safety of combination treatment in MTX-naïve patients. The AVERT study also 
provides  safety  data  after  drug  withdrawal  and  re-exposure,  with  a  low  frequency  of  adverse  events 
observed during the Withdrawal and Re-exposure Periods 
Overall,  the  AE  profiles  of  abatacept  were  similar  between  MTX  naïve  RA  patients  (the  subject  of  this 
indication  extension)  and  patients  with  RA  in  later  lines  of  treatment  (who  responded  inadequately  to 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/639090/2016 
Page 69/72 
 
  
  
 
previous therapy). The most common AEs in the main study in this application were nasopharyngitis, upper 
respiratory tract infections like sinusitis and urinary tract infections.   
The incidence of anti-abatacept antibodies in the abatacept + MTX group was 2.9% in the Treatment Period, 
37.7% in the Withdrawal Period, and 13.2% in the Re-exposure Period. The corresponding figures in the 
abatacept monotherapy group were slightly higher (5.0%, 44.1% and 13.3%). This is consistent with the 
assumed suppressive effect of MTX on ADA production. However, the overall immunogenicity was similar in 
both treatment groups (44.8% and 43.5%, respectively). The immunogenicity rate was thus particularly 
high  in  the  Withdrawal  Period  (37.7%  in  the  abatacept  +  MTX  group  and  44.1%  in  the  abatacept 
monotherapy group).  
Taken together, the safety data available from the randomized clinical trials and PM studies support a 
favourable safety profile of abatacept as a first line biologic. No new signals or clinically significant safety 
information have arisen study from study IM101226. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Average exposure for abatacept was 12.4 and 12.7 months for abatacept monotherapy and abatacept+MTX 
arms respectively in the Treatment Period in study IM101226. In the re-exposure period average exposure 
was 6.8 months for both abatacept arms.  
Given  that  the  mean  exposure  in  the  Treatment  period  was  only  just  over  a  year,  it  is  considered  as  a 
relatively  short-term  study.  In  the  long  term,  infections  and  local  injection  site  reactions  are  the  key 
identified  risks.  Opportunistic  infections,  malignancies  and  autoimmune  disorders  remain  the  most 
important  potential  serious  adverse  effects  for  abatacept.  Abatacept  has  an  extensive  risk  management 
programme  in  place  that  links  several  registries,  post  marketing  and  clinical  trial  experience;  these risk 
minimisation  measures  apply  equally  to  the  new  proposed  indication  for  abatacept  and  will  reduce  the 
uncertainties in the knowledge about the risks related to abatacept as a first line treatment in RA. 
The rate of anti-abatacept antibodies was unexpectedly high in the pivotal study especially in the Withdrawal 
Period. Current knowledge dictates that immunogenicity status in abatacept treated patients does not have 
an  effect  on  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  abatacept.  The  analysis  of  clinical  correlates  provided  limited 
information in this study due to the small number of ADA-positive patients during the treatment period, 
however the reported cases did not raise any concerns.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
A clinically meaningful sustained remission in a MTX-naïve RA population with an average high disease 
activity, has been demonstrated up to one year in patients treated with abatacept and methotrexate. 
Sub-population analysis revealed similar effects in patients with moderate disease activity at baseline 
(DAS-28 CRP between 3.2 and 5.1) and those with high baselined disease activity (DAS-28 CRP > 5.1)   
Remission is considered an optimal goal in RA and a valid and stringent endpoint. The efficacy rates and 
effect sizes were comparable to previously presented data on abatacept and other data on adalimumab and 
tocilizumab. 
The safety profile of abatacept is already relatively well established. No new major safety concerns were 
identified in this population of MTX-naïve RA patients with highly active disease. Infections remain the 
primary identified risk associated with the use of abatacept also during the long term. Infusion-related 
reactions and injection reactions following iv and sc administration of abatacept respectively are also known 
identified risks. The risk management plan of abatacept, has adequate routine and additional risk 
minimisation activities to manage these risks. In addition, its pharmacovigilance plan consists of extensions 
of clinical trials, pharmacoepidemiological study based of several RA registers and standard post-marketing 
safety surveillance to further characterise potential risks such as malignancies, autoimmune diseases and 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy.

Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
Abatacept in combination with MTX was more efficacious than MTX monotherapy across a wide range of 
clinical measures in study IM101226 including remission, improvement in physical function, and inhibition of 
structural  progression.  In  addition,  results  from  both  IM101226  and  IM101023  are  consistent  with  the 
efficacy profiles of abatacept in MTX-IR and TNF-IR RA patients in other trials, as well as being consistent by 
direct and indirect comparisons to anti-TNF and anti-IL–6 agents evaluated in these populations. Indeed, to 
date, there have been no failed trials in the investigation of abatacept therapy in RA, with consistency in 
results across endpoints and across trials in various RA populations. 
Safety results in studies of abatacept use suggest that the safety profile of abatacept therapy is comparable 
to that with other bDMARDs or anti-TNF agents.  
Integrated analyses of the efficacy and safety data in MTX-naïve RA therefore indicate that the abatacept 
benefit/risk profile is favourable in patients with MTX-naive RA. The therapeutic benefit of abatacept is when 
used earlier in the disease process, was not associated with any observed additional risk. Earlier aggressive 
intervention with an effective therapy for the appropriate patient is also consistent with recent treatment 
guidelines in RA.  
Based on the data available, abatacept in combination with methotrexate (MTX) is approvable for the 
treatment of highly active and progressive disease in adults with rheumatoid arthritis not previously treated 
with methotrexate. 
4.  Recommendations

Extension of Indication for Orencia in combination with methotrexate (MTX) in the treatment of adults with 
rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who have highly active disease not previously treated with MTX. As a 
consequence, sections 4.1 and 5.1 of the SmPC  (for powder for concentrate for solution for infusion) and 
sections 4.1, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC (for solution for injection in pre-filled syringe and solution for injection 
in pre-filled pen) are updated based on results from AVERT study (IM101226). The Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. Moreover, the updated RMP version 20.1 has been agreed. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

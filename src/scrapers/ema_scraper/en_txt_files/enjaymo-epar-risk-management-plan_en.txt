RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART II MODULE SI: EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE 
INDICATION(S) AND TARGET POPULATION(S)  
Sutimlimab is a first-in-class (FIC), humanized IgG4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets the 
CP by inhibiting the CP-specific serine protease, C1s. Upstream inhibition of the CP retains the 
important immune surveillance functional activities of lectin and alternative pathways (APs). 
Sutimlimab has been developed for the treatment of hemolytic anemia in adult patients with CAD, 
a CP-mediated life-threatening orphan disease. 
The epidemiology of the disease is summarized in the following table.

Table 6   Epidemiology of the cold agglutinin disease  
Cold Agglutinin Disease 
Cold agglutinin disease is a sub-type of AIHA characterized by hemolysis driven by activation 
of the CP. (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6) Cold agglutinin disease accounts for approximately 15%-25% of 
all AIHA. (4)(7) The rarity of CAD has limited the ability to perform large population-based 
studies. In 2006, the first population-based study in CAD suggested an annual incidence 
of 10 cases per 100 000 people in Norway. (8) In 2013, the incidence of CAD 
was 0.18 per 100 000 inhabitants in Denmark. (9) In 2020, a published study reported a CAD 
incidence rate of 1.9 per million per year in cold European climates versus a rate of 0.5 per 
million per year in warmer European regions. (10) In Denmark, Hansen (2020) reported that 
the 2008-2016 CAD incidence was 0.18/100 000 person-years, and CAD prevalence 
was 1.04/100 000 persons in 2015. (11) This is similar to the previous estimate of a 
prevalence of CAD of 1.26 per 100 000 inhabitants in Denmark in 2013. (9) In 2020, a 
published study reported a CAD prevalence estimate of 20 per million in cold European 
climates versus a rate of 5 per million in warmer European regions. (10) 
The risk of CAD onset increases after age 55 years. In the Norwegian cohort (N = 86), the 
median age at onset of CAD was 67 years (range 30-92 years) and the male to female ratio 
was 0.55. (8)  
The slight preponderance in women in some studies is likely due to women living to an older 
age, where the onset of the disease is more common. In a retrospective analysis of 89 CAD 
patients in the US (Mayo Clinic, year 1970-2012) median age at diagnosis was 72 years 
(range 43-91 years). (4) In a retrospective longitudinal analysis of CAD patients seen at 
Stanford Health Care, US (N = 29, year 2000 to 2016), 45% of patients were male and the 
average age at disease onset was 59 years (range 19-74 years). (12) 
Based on the recently (13) published first international consensus recommendations for AIHA 
in Dec-2019; it particularly highlights the importance of distinguishing CAD from CAS. Cold 
agglutinin disease is a low-grade B-Cell lymphoproliferative disorder detectable in blood or 
marrow with no clinical or radiological evidence of malignancy. Cold agglutinin disease is 
mediated by CA which are IgM autoantibodies that are able to agglutinate red blood cells upon 
binding to the I surface antigen. Cold agglutinin disease is defined by chronic hemolysis, a 
significant CA titre (most often defined as >64) at 4°C, Typical DAT pattern is a positive 
monospecific test for C3d only. 
In contrast to CAD, cold agglutinin syndrome is a secondary form and associated with 
underlying infections, overt malignancy, or autoimmune conditions. The same laboratory 
criteria apply to CAS complicating aggressive lymphoma or specific infections. (13) Therefore, 
the previous designation of “primary CAD” is aligned with “CAD” as defined in these 
guidelines.

Indication 
Cold Agglutinin Disease 
Main existing treatment 
options 
Natural history of the 
indicated condition in 
the untreated 
population including 
mortality and morbidity 
In EU, there are currently no approved pharmacological therapies for CAD and no established 
standard-of-care treatment. This results in varied treatment protocols with inconsistent 
response. Immunomodulatory and chemotherapy options are utilized off-label with limited 
efficacy in controlling hemolysis with delay in onset, variable hemoglobin responses, and 
incomplete durability of treatment outcome in the setting of significant side-effects and safety 
concerns.  
Cold agglutinin disease is currently managed by supportive therapy (cold avoidance), blood 
transfusions, off-label B-cell directed immunologic therapies and/or chemotherapy (eg, 
rituximab with or without bendamustine or fludarabine).  
Corticosteroid (due to limited efficacy and requirement to use high doses) and splenectomy 
(as extravascular hemolysis occurs predominantly in the liver) are not recommended for 
treatment CAD; however, are utilized. Rituximab monotherapy produces approximately 
50% partial response rates, with a delay in response of 1.5 months, and median response 
duration of 11 months. Whereas the combination of rituximab with chemotherapy has shown 
better results but is associated with more toxicity including severe neutropenia. (1)(3)(14)(15) 
Due to the temporary effectiveness of existing CAD treatments, patients often relapse and 
experience acute hemolytic crisis and require additional interventions (3.5 was the average 
number of therapies that patients with CAD received). (12) While RBC transfusion are utilized 
in CAD, it has limited efficacy due to the ubiquitous presence of the I antigen on all RBC, 
including the donor RBC, which are rapidly hemolyzed after a transfusion contributing to even 
higher hemolytic activity and thus has limited ability to alleviate anemia. Chronic transfusion 
support is typically not used in CAD for this reason, despite the ongoing presence of varying 
degrees of anemia. In population-based retrospective natural history studies, approximately 
35% to 49% of CAD patients did not receive transfusion support despite being anemic. (8)(12) 
Despite its limitations, the majority of CAD patients experience at some point during their 
disease a clinical exacerbation that requires RBC transfusion support. (12)  
Classical complement pathway mediated hemolysis leads to a chronic anemia of varying 
severity, with the median hemoglobin level in a population-based CAD study of 8.9 g/dL. (8) 
Acute Hemolytic Crisis in CAD patients may be triggered by febrile illness, trauma, or surgery. 
Symptoms can range from slight acrocyanosis to disabling Raynaud phenomena, fatigue, 
dyspnea, hemoglobinuria, weakness, and weight loss, with a median overall survival 
of 12.5 years (range, 1-21 years) from disease onset. (4)(8)(16)  
The prognosis of CAD patients depends on the severity of the disease. Death may result from 
infection or severe anemia or sometimes from an underlying lymphoma. Most commonly 
reported causes of death are lymphohematopoietic diseases; other causes of death include 
severe anemia complications, ischemic stroke, and infection. (12) The most recent 
population-based study in CAD, published in 2019, used the Danish National Health Registries 
and found a median survival for CAD patients of 8.5 years. Cold agglutinin disease patients 
had increased mortality compared with a matched general population cohort from Denmark 
(aHR: 1.84; 95% CI: 1.10-3.06; P = 0.020), with the highest mortality observed during the 
ﬁrst 5 years after diagnosis (aHR: 2.27; 95% CI: 1.32-3.89; P = 0.003). Mortality rates 1 
and 5 years after diagnosis were 17% and 39% in the CAD group versus 3% and 18% in the 
comparison cohort, respectively. (9) 
For the 29 retrospectively identified CAD patients in the Stanford Translational Research 
Integrated Database Environment database who were treated from 2000 to 2016, (12) 
7.1 severe anemia events per patient-year were observed over the follow-up time, with 2/3 of 
patients having a severe anemia event within the first year of diagnosis. Patients used a mean 
of 3.5 therapies and 67% had a severe anemia event within 6 months of their initial therapy. In 
reference to CAD-related health care use, in the first year after disease onset, 93% used 
outpatient services with a median of 26 outpatient visits per patient.

Cold Agglutinin Disease 
Recent studies have also shown that patients with CAD have an increased risk of TEs 
compared to matched controls. Similar to other hemolytic diseases, patients with CAD have an 
increased risk of thromboembolisms, including potentially life-threatening TEs such as 
pulmonary emboli and stroke, and early mortality. (17) In addition, the Danish population-level 
study also showed that the incidence rate of TEs was 30.4 (95% CI: 14.5-63.8) per 
1000 person-years in CAD patients, compared with 18.6 (95% CI: 14.2-24.5) per 
1000 person-years in the matched comparison group. (18) Further, a retrospective analysis of 
a Japanese claims database identified 344 Japanese patients with CAD and compared these 
to 3440 matched control patients, and found that the CAD cohort had higher TE rates than 
controls (34.8% versus 17.9%; P<0.0001). Both arterial and venous TEs were increased in the 
CAD group compared to the control group (25.0% versus 4.6% and 8.4% versus 4.0%, 
respectively; both P<0.0001). Most arterial TEs in the CAD cohort (87.2%) were myocardial 
infarctions. Overall odds ratio for TE development in CAD was 2.81 (95% CI: 2.18-3.61). (19)  
Cold agglutinin disease is considered a low-grade B-Cell lymphoproliferative disorder 
detectable in blood or marrow with no clinical or radiological evidence of malignancy. Cold 
agglutinin disease is characterized by immune hemolysis which is entirely 
complement-dependent, predominantly mediated by activation of the classical pathway. 
Cold agglutinin syndrome is transient and associated with underlying infections, overt 
malignancy, or autoimmune conditions. (1)(2)(3)(4)(5) 
Due to the fact that CAD is a rare disease, limited information is available. 
Lymphoproliferative Disorders or Haematological Malignancies: 
In a population-based retrospective follow-up study of 86 CAD patients in Norway, an 
abnormal kappa/lambda ratio in bone marrow was found in 90%, lymphoma in 76%, and 
lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma in 50%. Transformation to aggressive lymphoma occurred 
in 3.5% during 10 years. (8) 
Viral or Bacterial Infections: 
Postinfectious cold agglutinins are seen with viral and bacterial pathogens including 
mycoplasma (20), Epstein-barr virus (21)(22)(23), and legionella. There have been reports of 
cold agglutinin associated hemolysis associated with varicella (24)(25)(26), Citrobacter (27) 
and influenza. (4)(28)(29) 
Immune Diseases: 
Autoimmune diseases other than CAD were reported in 8% of patients in a population-based 
retrospective study of 86 CAD patients in Norway. (8) In addition, there have been other 
reports of association with SLE and rheumatoid arthritis. (30)(31)(32)

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART II MODULE SII: NON-CLINICAL PART 
OF THE SAFETY SPECIFICATION  
Key non-clinical findings 
This section presents a summary of non-clinical safety data for sutimlimab. Because sutimlimab 
either does not bind to or have functional activity against C1s of the CP of any of the non-clinical 
species used, with the exception of the cynomolgus monkey, the non-clinical safety profile of 
sutimlimab was evaluated only in the monkey. The non-clinical safety profile of sutimlimab, was 
evaluated in the following in vivo and ex-vivo studies, 
 Repeat-dose general toxicology studies with sutimlimab up to 26 weeks duration using the 
IV route in cynomolgus monkeys; 
 An enhanced pre/postnatal development (ePPND) toxicology study with sutimlimab in 
cynomolgus monkeys using the IV route; 
 An ex-vivo tissue cross-reactivity study in human tissues with biotinylated sutimlimab; 
 An exploratory in vitro immunogenic potential study 
The sutimlimab-related findings are described below in Table 7.  
The doses administered in the toxicology studies provided substantially higher maximum plasma 
concentration (Cmax) levels in vivo, relative to 90% inhibitory concentration (IC90) values 
determined by an evaluation of CP activity, confirming target saturation. 
Cynomolgus monkeys constitute a pharmacologically-relevant species for non-clinical evaluation of 
sutimlimab. The pharmacologic activity of sutimlimab is comparable to that for humans in vitro 
(half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] values of 15.6 or 14.7 μg/mL for inhibition of 80% 
serum-mediated hemolysis in monkeys and humans, respectively) and in vivo (IC90 values 
of 22.3 or 20.1 μg/mL for inhibition of CP activity in monkeys or humans, respectively). 
Safety pharmacology endpoints were assessed as part of the nonhuman primate repeat-dose 
toxicology studies, evaluating the cardiovascular system (CVS), central nervous system (CNS) and 
respiratory parameters. No sutimlimab-related effects were observed in any of the safety 
pharmacology assessments. 
Sutimlimab was well tolerated in repeat-dose general toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys 
following the IV administration of 100 mg/kg/week for 5 weeks and 180 mg/kg/week for 26 weeks. 
The highest dose administered (180 mg/kg/week) was the no-observed-adverse-effect level 
(NOAEL). Sutimlimab displayed equivalent, maximal inhibition of serum CP activity at all doses, 
but a dose-dependent duration of inhibition was observed. Despite consistent exposure to 
sutimlimab and inhibition of CP activity for up to 31 weeks at 180 mg/kg/week, there were no 
sutimlimab-related alterations in autoimmune parameters, including circulating immune 
complexes-complement component 1, q subcomponent (CIC-C1q) concentrations, and 
anti-extractable nuclear antigen (anti-ENA) IgG and anti-double stranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) IgG 
antibody levels.

Sutimlimab was not evaluated in genetic toxicology studies, which were considered inappropriate 
for biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals, consistent with recommendations in International 
Council for Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use 
(ICH) S6. Based upon the large molecular weight (approximately 145 kDa), sutimlimab is not 
anticipated to cross cellular and nuclear membranes as an intact molecule or to directly interact with 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). 
Based on a carcinogenicity risk assessment, which evaluated the weight-of-evidence from the 
animal toxicology studies and the literature assessment of the CP and its inhibition, sutimlimab does 
not appear to increase the risk of cancer. 
The potential effects of CP inhibition on embryo-fetal and postnatal development were studied in an 
ePPND study in monkeys. Sutimlimab was well tolerated in adult pregnant cynomolgus monkeys 
and in their offspring at doses of up to 180 mg/kg/week IV, which were monitored up to 3 months 
of age. There were no sutimlimab-related findings (maternal, fetal, or infant) in any assessed 
parameter. The maternal and developmental NOAEL was considered to be 180 mg/kg/week IV, the 
highest dose evaluated. 
A tissue cross-reactivity study evaluating the binding of sutimlimab in normal human tissues, 
demonstrated specific immunostaining of C1s that was identified in most tissues evaluated, which is 
the expected staining pattern for C1s. Immunostaining in tissues is primarily within the vasculature 
(plasma) and extracellular spaces (matrix) and not on tissue or cellular surfaces. 
The immunogenic potential of sutimlimab was assessed in an ex-vivo T-cell proliferation assay. 
Results indicated that sutimlimab has a very low potential (0% response rate) for immunogenicity. 
In conclusion, no positive T-cell proliferation responses to the fully humanized sutimlimab antibody 
were observed indicating that sutimlimab has a very low potential for immunogenicity. 
There was no evidence in animal toxicology or pharmacology studies to suggest a dependence 
potential or abuse liability for sutimlimab. The rationale for not performing drug abuse and liability 
assessment studies was supported by the absence of behavioral and anatomic pathology effects in 
the CNS in any of the toxicology studies. 
Overall, sutimlimab has a low potential for causing immune system-related adverse effects, either 
directly through inhibition of C1s or indirectly affecting general immune function.
The key non-clinical findings are presented in the following table.

Toxicity
Repeat-Dose Toxicity 
No test article-related changes were observed in 
repeat-dose toxicity studies in monkeys up to 
26 weeks in duration. The highest dose evaluated 
(180 mg/kg/week IV) was considered the NOAEL.
Reproductive and Developmental Toxicity 
 Embryo-fetal and Developmental toxicity 
In an ePPND study in cynomolgus monkeys, 
sutimlimab was administered IV at doses up to 
The margin of safety is based on comparing the 26 weeks 
repeat-dose monkey AUC at the NOAEL dose to the projected 
human AUC (based on a Population PK analysis; Report 
POH0756) for the highest dose test in humans (7.5 g sutimlimab 
IV per week) is 3.6-fold. 
Since no fertility study was performed with sutimlimab, it is not 
possible to state whether or not sutimlimab would have an effect 
on pregnancy or early embryo development.

Key Safety Findings 
180 mg/kg/week to pregnant monkeys from 
Day-20 post coitum until delivery (approximately 
21 doses). Maternal toxicity endpoints before and after 
delivery were assessed. Monitoring of offspring from 
approximately 3 months after delivery was performed. 
Administration of sutimlimab did not cause any 
embryo-fetal effects or effect on gestation length. No 
differences in maternal loss (abortions or still births) 
were observed. Therefore, it was concluded that 
sutimlimab did not affect either the maintenance of 
pregnancy or natural delivery. 
No sutimlimab-related effects in infants were noted up 
to 3 months after birth in the following parameters: 
clinical observations, body weight, neurobehavioral 
test battery, skeletal development, coagulation, serum 
chemistry, organ weights, macroscopic observations, 
and microscopic findings. 
The maternal and infant NOAEL was 
180 mg/kg/week IV, the highest dose evaluated. 
The margin of safety is based on comparing the 
ePPND monkey AUC at the NOAEL dose 
(180 mg/kg/week) to the projected human AUC (based 
on a Population PK analysis; Report POH0756) for the 
highest dose tested in humans (7.5 g sutimlimab IV 
per week) is 2.9-fold.  
Carcinogenicity  
Based on the weight-of-evidence from the animal 
toxicology studies and the literature assessment of CP 
inhibition, the data supported the conclusion that 
chronic administration of sutimlimab does not pose an 
increased risk of cancer.
Safety pharmacology  
No evidence of sutimlimab-related CVS, CNS, or 
respiratory changes in 5-week and 6-month 
repeat-dose study in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Relevance to human usage 
Evidence from the ePPND study does suggest that sutimlimab 
had no effect on the maintenance of pregnancy, embryo-fetal 
development (eg, no teratogenicity), natural birth, and early 
infant development following birth. Furthermore, reproductive 
organs/tissues (male/female) were not targets following the 
chronic administration (26 weeks) of sutimlimab to cynomolgus 
monkeys. 
While there is no evidence in the literature suggesting that 
inhibition of C1s would have the potential of adversely impacting 
fertility and ability to get pregnant, this has not been evaluated 
for sutimlimab. Considering limited reproductive toxicity 
information and a lack of clinical experience with the use of 
sutimlimab in pregnant or breast-feeding women, appropriate 
recommendations are provided in the label. 
Of note, the risk of CAD onset increases after age of 55 years 
(refer to the Norwegian cohort (N = 86) where the median age at 
onset of CAD was 67 years (range 30-92 years) and the male to 
female ratio was 0.55. (8) Thus, the use of sutimlimab in womb 
or pregnant women is anticipated to be limited. 
A preclinical evaluation that sutimlimab did not pose an 
increased risk of cancer is relevant to human use considering 
that some immunomodulating drugs in the market can be 
associated with higher risk of cancers. 
Pre-clinical studies did not show evidence that treatment with 
sutimlimab increased injury to heart, lung, and CNS in human.

Conclusion: 
No outstanding safety concern has been concluded based on the absence of key-safety findings from 
non-clinical studies.

EXPOSURE  
Sutimlimab (BIVV009) is a FIC, humanized IgG4 mAb that targets the CP by inhibiting the 
CP-specific serine protease, C1s. Sutimlimab has been developed for the treatment of hemolytic 
anemia in adult patients with CAD, a life-threatening orphan disease. The proposed dose regimen of 
sutimlimab is 6.5 g (for patients <75 kg) or 7.5 g (for patients ≥75 kg), depending on the patient’s 
body weight at baseline, which is to be administered by IV infusion over 1-2 hours once per week 
for the first 2 doses followed by every other week dosing thereafter. 
As of the data cut-off date for the RMP, the clinical development program for sutimlimab includes a 
total of 6 clinical studies. All the clinical studies have been completed. A tabular summary of the 
6 studies (BIVV009-01, TNT009-02, BIVV009-03, BIVV009-04, BIVV009-05, and

A total of 208 subjects (76 patients with CAD, 36 patients with other CMDs, and 96 NHVs) were 
enrolled in sutimlimab studies.  
The CAD safety analysis set is the primary focus of the safety analysis in the RMP and includes 
CAD patients who received at least one dose of sutimlimab in the completed Phase 1 open-label 
study BIVV009-01 (Part C), the completed Phase 1 open-label extension phase of study 
BIVV009-01 (Part E), the completed Phase 3 open-label study BIVV009-03 (Part A), the

placebo-controlled Phase 3 study BIVV009-04 (Part A) and the completed open-label extension 
phase of study BIVV009-04 (Part B). Overall, 76 patients with CAD were exposed to sutimlimab 
for a total of 146.94 patient-years. Exposure data from these studies are summarized in Table 9.  
Safety data in patients with other CMD, BP, WAIHA, renal allograft AMR and ITP were 
considered supportive to the safety profile characterized in the CAD population with data included 
from one completed Phase 1 open-label study BIVV009-01 Part C and one completed Phase 1 
open-label study BIVV009-201 Parts A and B. A total of 36 patients with other CMDs received at 
least one dose of sutimlimab for 16.16 patient-years. Exposure data from these studies are 
summarized in Table 10.  
Safety data in NHVs treated with sutimlimab were also considered supportive to the safety profile 
characterized in the CAD population with data included from one completed Phase 1 double-blind 
randomized study BIVV009-01 Parts A and B, one completed Phase 1 double-blind study 
TNT009-02, and one completed Phase 1 open-label study BIVV009-05 Parts A and B. Among the

CAS, treatment of these underlying 
conditions may lead to resolution of 
the cold agglutinins. 
The presence of CAS may confound 
the assessment of the efficacy

(eg, with 
bendamustine, 
fludarabine, ibrutinib, 
or cytotoxic drugs) 
This exclusion criteria is considered as a 
common exclusion criterion in clinical trials 
and not due to specific safety concern.  
Human IgG antibodies are known to cross 
the placental barrier and to pass into 
human milk, however, there is no available 
data evidence in the literature suggesting 
that C1s inhibitors would have a potential 
of adversely impacting fertility and ability 
to get pregnant. 
Moreover, pregnant and breast-feeding 
women may not be a target population 
since risks of CAD onsets increase after 
the age of 55 years. 
Use in females who are pregnant or 
lactating is properly addressed in the 
label.  
Although there is limited Company 
sponsored clinical trial experience with 
subjects who received rituximab or 
rituximab combination therapies or an 
equivalent daily dose of ≥10 mg/day 
prednisone or have had changes in the 
steroid dose during the conduct of the 
study, corticosteroids, rituximab and 
rituximab combination therapies are 
immunosuppressive agents that may 
increase the risk for infections. Therefore, 
exposure to other immunomodulatory 
agents is considered as a risk factor and 
addressed as such in [Part II SVII]. The 
label recommends to use caution when 
treating patients who may be 
immunocompromised.

REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SAFETY SPECIFICATION  
SVI.1 
POTENTIAL FOR MISUSE FOR ILLEGAL PURPOSES  
Overall, there was no evidence in animal toxicology or pharmacology studies to suggest a 
dependence potential or abuse liability for sutimlimab and thus, no dedicated drug abuse liability 
assessment studies of sutimlimab were conducted. The reasons for this are detailed below. 
Sutimlimab is a humanized IgG4 mAb that binds to and inhibits the CP specific serine protease, 
C1s. With a molecular weight of approximately 145 kDa, sutimlimab is unlikely to cross the 
blood-brain barrier to any significant extent. In general, brain penetration is limited unless a 
therapeutic molecule is lipid soluble with a molecular weight of less than 400 to 600 Da. (47) Thus, 
considering the literature data on similar monoclonal antibodies, very low concentrations of 
sutimlimab would be expected in the cerebrospinal fluid and any potential for abuse liability is 
considered very limited. (48)
Monoclonal antibodies do not have any active metabolites and are not precursors of identified 
controlled drug substances. It is generally recognized that monoclonal antibodies are metabolized 
by degradation into small peptides and individual amino acids and follow endogenous catabolism, 
and these small peptides and amino acids lack any other significant biological activity. Therefore, 
the potential for drug dependence and abuse liability from a degradation product of sutimlimab is 
very low. 
In non-clinical, repeat-dose toxicology studies with sutimlimab, no functional or anatomic 
pathology effects in the CNS were evident in cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 180 mg/kg/week 
IV for 26 weeks. No sutimlimab-related abnormal behavioral clinical signs or anatomic pathology 
findings in CNS tissues were observed. In the ePPND study in which sutimlimab was administered 
up to 180 mg/kg/week IV, no test article-related functional effects or anatomic pathology findings 
were observed in the CNS of pregnant monkeys or their offspring which were evaluated up to 
three months after birth. Functional developmental assessments in the offspring from 
sutimlimab-treated pregnant monkeys (including grasp support, eye reflexes, elicited postural tones 
(hip abduction, knee flexed, toes flexed, shoulder abducted, elbow flexed, finder glexed, head 
extended), elicited dorsiflexion (wrist; ankle), moro reflex, build-up, righting reflex, prone 
progression, clasp/grasp reflex, visual following, sucking, rooting, snout reflex, pupil response, 
glabellar tap, lipsmack orient) were comparable to the control group and no sutimlimab related 
effects were observed. For the 26-week repeat-dose toxicology study, the NOAEL Cmax of 
11 700 μg/mL was above the ex-vivo IC90 for sutimlimab-mediated inhibition of CP activity 
(22.3 μg/mL).

SVII.1 
IDENTIFICATION OF SAFETY CONCERNS IN THE INITIAL RMP SUBMISSION  
The following safety topics are discussed and presented in Section SVII.1.1 (Risks not considered 
important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the RMP): 
 Potential harm from overdose 
 Risks related to the administration procedure 
 Effect on fertility 
 Risk in pregnant and lactating women  
 Hypertension 
 Acrocyanosis and Raynaud’s phenomenon 
 Pediatric safety issues 
 Potential for off-label use 
 Potential for transmission of infectious agents 
The following safety topics are discussed and presented in Section SVII.1.2 (Risks considered 
important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the RMP): 
 Serious infections 
 Meningococcal infections 
 Development of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus 
 Serious hypersensitivity reactions and/or anaphylaxis 
SVII.1.1 
Risks not considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in 
the RMP  
Reason(s) for not including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety concerns in the 
RMP 
 Risks related to administration:  
Sutimlimab will have a single formulation, single IV route of administration and be packaged as 
single use vials of 1.1 g each. The final dose will be prepared and dispensed by a healthcare 
professional (HCP) based on the subject’s weight (either 6 vials for a 6.5 g dose or 7 vials for a 
7.5 g dose) in an inpatient hospital or infusion center or at home in case of home infusion at the 
time of each dose. 
-
Potential harm from overdose: Pharmacodynamically, sutimlimab exhibits a binary “all 
or none” complete or nearly complete inhibition of CP deficiency, with increased dose 
levels leading to increased duration of inhibition. The human safety risk from off target 
effects of mAbs therapeutics is generally considered to be low. Based on the data from 
 
RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - Part II Module SVII 
BIVV009 - Sutimlimab 
FINAL 
Version 1.2 
DLP of this module: 25-JAN-2022 
non-clinical and clinical studies conducted to date, there is no evidence of overdose or 
increased risk of intentional overdose. In toxicologic studies, no adverse effects were 
observed from sutimlimab administration up to the highest dose evaluated 
(180 mg/kg/week). Sutimlimab will be prepared by an HCP and administrated within an 
inpatient hospital or infusion center or at home in case of home infusion. Therefore, the 
potential risk of overdose is considered low for which no specific pharmacovigilance or 
risk minimization activities are necessary. 
- Risks related to the administration procedure: Sutimlimab is administered via 
IV infusion pump without an associated medical device. The risks related to the 
administration procedure are similar to other products administered intravenously and 
are unrelated to sutimlimab. Thus, there are no risks related to the administration 
procedure specific to sutimlimab and no specific pharmacovigilance or risk 
minimization activities are required.  
 Risk with minimal clinical impact on patients:  
- Effect on fertility: Dedicated animal fertility studies have not been conducted for 
sutimlimab to assess the impact on fertility or sperm, so it is not known whether 
sutimlimab can affect fertility or sperm development in humans. No adverse effects on 
reproductive organs have been observed in cynomolgus monkeys of either sex, up to the 
highest dose evaluated (180 mg/kg/week) following 26 weeks of administration. The 
target patient population with CAD is generally over 55 years old, so the impact on 
fertility would not be considered applicable for that patient population. A specific 
labeling statement is proposed, and no additional pharmacovigilance or risk 
minimization activities are necessary.

population with CAD is generally over 55 years old. A specific labeling statement is 
proposed, and no additional pharmacovigilance or risk minimization activities are 
deemed necessary. 
 Known risks that do not impact the risk-benefit profile 
- Hypertension: As of the DLP of the RMP, of the 66 patients who participated in 
two phase 3 CAD clinical studies (BIVV009-03 Part A and B and BIVV009-04 Part A 
and B) 16 patients (21.1%), experienced an event of hypertension and 3 patients (4.5%) 
experienced an event of increased blood pressure. Of the 10 patients who participated in 
the BIVV009-01 C and E studies, none of them experienced an event of hypertension or 
blood pressure increased. Overall the increase of systolic blood pressure and diastolic 
blood pressure during treatment with sutimlimab have been minimal with values 
remaining close to normal range, resulting in the initiation of an antihypertensive drug or 
adaptation of underlying antihypertensive treatment in a limited number of patients. This 
is an adverse drug reaction listed in the labeling. 
- Acrocyanosis/Raynaud’s phenomenon: As of the DLP of the RMP, of the 66 patients 
who participated in two phase 3 CAD clinical studies (BIVV009-03 Part A and B and 
BIVV009-04 Part A and B) 13 patients (19.7%) experienced acrocyanosis 
and 7 patients (10.6%) experienced Raynaud’s phenomenon. Of the 10 patients who 
participated in the BIVV009-01 C and E study, 2 (20%) patients experienced Raynaud’s 
phenomenon and none of the patients experienced acrocyanosis. Acrocyanosis and 
Raynaud’s phenomenon are symptoms of the underlying disease (CAD). Substantial

sutimlimab group compared with minimal changes in the placebo group, however in a 
limited subset of patients a new onset or a worsening of these symptoms occurred during 
treatment with sutimlimab. Acrocyanosis and Raynaud’s phenomenon are considered as 
a potential risk of sutimlimab and are addressed in the labeling.

Pediatric safety issues: Cold agglutinin disease is an adult-onset disorder. Pediatric 
subjects are not part of the target patient population for this indication. 
 Other reasons for considering the risks not important 
-
-
Potential for off-label use: The potential for off-label use of sutimlimab is expected to be 
low given the specific mode of action of sutimlimab. 
. Sutimlimab is expressed in CHO cells and is produced using 
Potential for transmission of infectious agents: Sutimlimab is produced from the master 
 derived from the Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-M cell 
cell bank (MCB) 
line 
standard mammalian cell cultivation methods followed by chromatographic purification. 
Drug product is manufactured from drug substance by sterile filtration and aseptic filling 
into Type I glass vials with bromobutyl rubber caps and aluminum crimp seals. The 
aseptic manufacture of sutimlimab is validated and carried out in accordance with the 
“EU Guidelines to Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) for Medicinal Products for 
Human Use, Annex 1”. The risk of transmission of infectious agents is therefore 
considered to be low.

The complement system is part of our innate immunity and consists of three pathways 
(classical, lectin and alternative). The complement system has multiples roles in both innate 
and adaptive immunity. Pharmacologic inhibition or inherited deficiency of the components of 
the complement pathway may lead to impaired opsonization of antigen-antibody complexes, 
phagocytosis and pathogen neutralization or killing. Terminal complement inhibition may 
prevent the formation of the membrane-attack complex which is integral to the killing of 
N. meningitidis. (49)(50) 
Meningococcal infections such as sepsis or meningitis may result in death, be life-threatening, 
or result in significant disability if not prevented or managed appropriately.  
As of the DLP of the RMP, there have been no report of meningococcal infections or

predominate, the types of infections seen in subjects with congenital CP deficiencies include a 
variety of encapsulated bacteria. (49)(54)(55)(56)  
Sutimlimab only targets the CP and leaves both the AP and LP intact for immune surveillance. 
As sutimlimab leaves the lectin and alternative pathways intact for immune surveillance as well 
as the terminal complement pathway intact for formation of the membrane attack complex, the 
risk of infection, particularly with encapsulated bacteria, may be lower than with other 
complement inhibitors. Unlike with terminal complement deficiencies, the type of infections in 
subjects with congenital CP deficiencies mimic those with hypogammaglobulinemia and include 
other organisms besides meningococcus. Cold agglutinin disease patients have an increased 
risk of serious infections at baseline due to impaired immune function as it affects an elderly, 
often medically complex patient population. Cold agglutinin disease subjects may receive other 
immunomodulatory agents, which depending on the gap before sutimlimab treatment may have 
a lingering impact on immune functions. Cold agglutinin disease is most often associated with 
an underlying B-cell lymphoproliferative disorder, which may separately impair immune 
response. 
Frequency: 
As of the DLP of the RMP, of the 66 patients who participated in two phase 3 CAD clinical 
studies (BIVV009 03 Part A and B and BIVV009 04 Part A and B) 10 patients (15.2%) have 
experienced at least one serious TEAE of infection, including infections with Escherichia coli, 
Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, which are encapsulated bacteria. Of 
the 10 patients who participated in the BIVV009-01 C and E studies, 2 (20.0%) patients 
experienced serious infections. While serious infections have been reported in CAD patients 
receiving sutimlimab, these patients are elderly, medically complex, and the majority have other 
underlying risk factors for infection including prior/concomitant immunomodulatory therapies. 
Treatment with sutimlimab was discontinued in one patient due to serious TEAE of Klebsiella 
pneumonia. 
Severity and nature of risk: 
As of the DLP of the RMP, the pattern of infections in patients with CAD was consistent with an 
older, often medically complex patient population, including some patients who received chronic 
immunomodulatory therapies. While serious infections were reported, including with 
encapsulated bacteria (eg, E. coli, Streptococcus pyogenes, S. aureus, and S. epidermidis), 
often the causative organism was not identified. Most patients with serious infections had 
underlying risk factors for infection. 
Seriousness/outcomes:  
Serious infections may result in death or be life threatening. As of the DLP of the RMP, of 
the 66 patients who participated in two phase 3 CAD clinical studies (BIVV009-03 Part A and B 
and BIVV009-04 Part A and B), one patient died due to serious TEAE of K. pneumonia. There 
were no fatal events of infections reported from the BIVV009-01 C and E study. 
Background incidence/prevalence:  
The annual incidence of hospitalized pneumonia has been described in five hospitals in Chicago 
and Nashville, from Jan-2010 to Jun-2012, estimated at 248/100 000 adults (235 to 261), with 
the highest rates in adults aged 65-79 years (630/100 000), and 80+ years (1643/100 000). (57) 
In Europe, the annual incidence of community-acquired hospitalized pneumonia has been 
reported to range from 0.5 to 15.1 cases per 1000 people in adults, and up to 242/1000 in adults 
>85 years old (Sweden). (58)  
In US database studies, the cumulative 24-years incidence of sepsis rose exponentially across 
age groups, from 29.6/100 000 in 18-29 age group, to 2422.3/100 000 in 90-99 age group. The 
incidence of severe sepsis in older patients was 2620/100 000 population. The mean age of 
patients with severe sepsis was 63.8 years in the first study, which increased to 68.2 years in 
the latter study. (59) In a retrospective database study in Norway (Patient Registry and Statistics 
Norway), (60) on the occurrence, patient characteristics and outcomes of sepsis hospitalizations 
in 2011-2012, the annual population incidence of hospitalized sepsis was 140/100 000

Meningococcal infections 
Based on the functions of the CP in the innate and adaptive immune system and experience in 
subjects receiving terminal complement inhibitors, CP inhibition with sutimlimab could 
theoretically lead to impaired opsonization of antigen-antibody complexes and reduced killing 
of N. meningitidis. (49)
Mechanism of action; literature; class effect seen with terminal complement inhibitors. 
Terminal complement component deficiency, particularly of C5b-C8 components, is associated 
with a 7000 to 10 000-fold higher risk of developing meningococcal disease. This is due to 
apparent critical role of the membrane attack complex for cell lysis and bacterial killing of 
Neisserial species. (61) Up to 20-30% of patients with recurrent disseminated Neisserial 
infections have complement deficiency. (50) Use of Eculizumab (SOLIRIS®), a marketed 
C5 terminal complement pathway inhibitor, is associated with a 1000 to 2000-fold increased 
risk of meningococcal infection, even in vaccinated patients. (55) Fifty to sixty percent of 
patients with congenital terminal complement deficiencies have systemic bacterial infections 
reported, which are almost exclusively with N. meningitidis and may recur in 50% of patients. 
In comparison, 20% of patients with early CP deficiencies report systemic infections, over half 
of which are due to S. pneumoniae. These infections in patients with congenital CP 
component deficiencies are rarely recurrent with the same organism and are less likely to be 
overwhelming severe if innate immunity is intact. (53) 
The CP functions as part of the innate and adaptive immune response to foreign pathogens. 
Subjects with inherited CP component deficiencies have an increased risk of infections with a 
variety of encapsulated bacterial organisms, similar to patients with 
hypogammaglobulinemia.(49)(50)(52)(54) Unlike with terminal complement deficiencies where

meningococcal infections predominate, the types of infections seen in subjects with congenital 
CP deficiencies include a variety of encapsulated bacteria. (49)(54)(55)(56) 
Sutimlimab selectively inhibits the CP and leaves the immune surveillance functions of the AP 
and LP intact. Activation of the AP and LP can still lead to downstream activation of the 
terminal complement pathway. Antibody-coated N. meningitidis can activate both the CP and 
AP. However, simultaneous inhibition of the CP and AP prevented killing of antibody-coated 
N. meningitidis. (62) 
As BIVV009 leaves the lectin and alternative pathways intact for immune surveillance as well 
as the terminal complement pathway intact for formation of the membrane attack complex 
following activation of the LP and AP, the risk of meningococcal infection may be lower than 
with other complement inhibitors. Unlike with terminal complement deficiencies, the type of 
infections in subjects with congenital CP deficiencies mimic those with 
hypogammaglobulinemia and include other organisms besides meningococcus.

Seriousness/outcomes:  
Meningococcal infections, such as sepsis or meningitis, may result in death or be

Background incidence/prevalence:  
In Western countries (Finland, Netherlands, and the US), the incidence of bacterial meningitis 
in the general population was 0.7-0.9 per 100 000 per year in the past 10-20 years. In African 
countries (Burkina Faso and Malawi), incidence rates of bacterial meningitis in the general 
population are still substantially higher at 10-40 per 100 000 persons per year. (63) The 
incidence of meningitis in elderly patients (>65 old) has been described in a hospital in 
Barcelona, estimated at 7.4 per 100 000 inhabitants per year in the years 1982-2010 (64) and 
in a larger US study, where it was estimated at 1.73/100 000 1.44 to 2.06) in the 
years 2006-2007. (65) The US study showed a decline in the incidence over calendar years 
from 1998 to 2007. These studies also mentioned the negative impact of co-morbidities or 
conditions that may impair the immune system. 
No epidemiologic data is available regarding the frequency of meningitis in CAD patients.  
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Risk factors for meningococcal infections may include patients that are unvaccinated or 
incompletely vaccinated against meningococcus, including serogroup B; exposure to terminal 
complement inhibitor therapies; other inherited or acquired immunodeficiency; asplenia; 
elderly. 
Preventability  
This risk can be reduced or prevented with an appropriate program of prophylactic

Characterization of 
the risk 
Development of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus 
Long-term CP inhibition could theoretically increase the risk of SLE due to the role of the 
C1 complex in immune complex clearance, as seen in patients with congenital deficiencies of 
C1 complex components (C1q, C1s, and C1r). The proposed mechanism for SLE development 
with congenital CP deficiency is due to impaired immune complex processing, clearance of 
apoptotic cellular debris and regulation of B-cell mediated immune tolerance to self-antigens 
which may all contribute to auto-antibody formation. (67)(68) 
Mechanism of action; literature finding in patients with congenital CP deficiencies.  
Inhibition of the CP may lead to impaired identification, opsonization, and clearance of immune 
complexes and apoptotic cellular debris leading to autoantibody formation and/or tissue 
deposits and inflammation. (67)(69) Extrapolating from rare human cases of congenital 
deficiency of complement factors C1, C2, or C4, which are amongst the strongest genetic risk 
factors for SLE, it is theoretically possible that chronic inhibition of any of these factors could 
result in an increased risk of SLE. (50)(70)(71)(72)(73)(74)(75)(76)(77)(78) Homozygous and 
heterogenous hereditary deficiency of an individual CP components (C1q, C1r, C1s, C4, and 
C2) is strongly associated with an increased susceptibility to SLE. Systemic lupus 
erythematosus incidence in C1q, C4 or C1r/C1s deficiency is 90%, 75% and 50-57% 
respectively. (63)(69) 
However, pharmacologic inhibition of C1s does not necessarily equate to congenital deficiency 
of the C1 complex. Sutimlimab inhibits the C1s enzymatic function in the C1 complex but leaves 
the non-enzymatic function of C1q intact, which is important for the opsonization and 
phagocytic removal of apoptotic cells, which may help protect against autoimmunity. The AP, 
which remains intact with sutimlimab administration, provides some redundancy for clearance of 
immune complexes and cellular debris via C3b binding and ultimately clearance via liver and 
splenic macrophages. (54) It is uncertain what level and duration of CP inhibition might be 
required to increase the risk for SLE development. Thus, SLE remains a theoretical, 
mechanism-related risk from C1s inhibition. 
Frequency:  
As of the DLP of the RMP, there have not been any reports of SLE development in patients 
receiving sutimlimab in CAD. Estimates of incidence and prevalence of SLE in the general 
population in North America are 23.2/100 000 person-years (95% CI: 23.4, 24.0) 
and 241/100 000 people (95% CI: 130, 352), respectively. The lowest incidences of SLE in the 
general population were reported in Africa and Ukraine (0.3/100 000 person-years), and the 
lowest prevalence of SLE in the general population was in Northern Australia (zero case in a 
sample of 847 people). Women were more frequently affected than men for every age and 
ethnic group. Incidence peaked in middle adulthood and occurred later for men. People of Black 
ethnicity had the highest incidence and prevalence of SLE, whereas those with White ethnicity 
had the lowest incidence and prevalence. (79)(80)

Development of Systemic Lupus Erythematosus 
A matched cohort comparison study conducted in 2020 showed that the incidence of SLE in the 
CAD patients was 4.44 per 1000 person-year compared to a 0.45 per 1000 person-year in the 
matching comparison group. (81)(82) 
Severity and nature of risk:  
As of the DLP of the RMP, there have not been any reports of SLE development in patients 
receiving sutimlimab in CAD. Systemic lupus erythematosus is a rare, serious, chronic, 
autoinflammatory autoimmune disease that affects many organ systems and has no curative 
therapy. (83) 
In patients with congenital complement deficiencies, SLE has characteristic features including 
earlier age of onset, prominent photosensitivity, lower frequency of renal disease, and variable 
antinuclear antibody titers (anti-Ro present in approximately two-thirds). (54)  
Seriousness/outcomes:  
Systemic lupus erythematosus may be a life-threatening illness with deaths due to infection, 
chronic vascular disease or kidney-related complications. 15-year survival after diagnosis has 
been approximated at 76%. Subjects with more prolonged survival after SLE diagnosis often 
have considerable morbidity with impaired QOL and reduced functional abilities. (84) 
Patients that have concurrent autoimmune disease, pre-existing autoantibodies. 
Changes from positive to negative and negative to positive in SLE panel results were observed 
in both healthy volunteers and CAD patients receiving sutimlimab with no clear clinical 
correlate. Thus, SLE panel monitoring is unlikely to be useful for clinical management in the 
absence of clinical signs and symptoms. Close surveillance for the signs and symptoms of SLE 
may aid in early detection and treatment. It is unknown how to prevent development of SLE. 
Based on limited therapy choices for CAD patient and available data, benefit-risk remains 
positive.
Healthcare resource utilization may be high in patients with severe disease. 
(85)(86)(87)(88)(89)(90)(91) The individual health risk could be serious if not managed 
appropriately. However, the impact on public health has not been evaluated.

risk 
Potential mechanism 
Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence  
Serious hypersensitivity reactions and/or anaphylaxis 
Large protein molecules, despite humanization, can be immunogenic. Hypersensitivity risk 
with sutimlimab theoretically could be either IgE mediated (acute reactions) or IgG mediated 
(or other isotype) with generalized and acute symptoms due to Fc-IgG mediated activation of 
immune cells. Inhibition of CP doesn’t prevent LP or AP activation, which may produce 
potent anaphylatoxins.  
Class effect with mAbs (literature); mechanism of action  
Large protein molecules, despite humanization, can be immunogenic. Sutimlimab is biologic 
therapeutic protein and hypersensitivity risk, including anaphylaxis, is considered a class 
effect with mAbs. Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been 
observed with other mAbs.

Serious hypersensitivity reactions and/or anaphylaxis 
Frequency:  
As of the DLP of the RMP, there have been no SAEs reported of serious hypersensitivity 
reactions or anaphylaxis.  
As of the DLP of the RMP, non-serious reports suggestive of potential hypersensitivity 
reactions have been reported in patients receiving sutimlimab in the two phase 3 CAD clinical 
trials. AEs suggestive of potential hypersensitivity reactions associated with sutimlimab 
included infusion-related reactions, experienced by 4 (6.1%) patients, injection site 
erythema 2 (3.0%), injection site pruritis 1 (1.5%), Of the 10 patients who participated in the 
BIVV009-01 C and E studies, 1 (10.0%) patient experienced nonserious TEAE of rash that 
was suggestive of potential hypersensitivity reaction. 
Severity and nature of risk:  
Symptoms may range from local injection site reactions to anaphylactic shock which may be 
life-threatening. Onset of symptoms may be immediate upon initiation of infusion or occur up 
to 14 days after administration or with subsequent exposures. The severity and mechanism 
of hypersensitivity reactions may depend on amount of foreign antigen and rate of infusion. 
Seriousness/outcomes:  
As of the DLP of the RMP, of the 66 patients who participated in the two phase 3 CAD 
studies (BIVV009-03 Part A and B and BIVV009-04 Part A and B), one patient discontinued 
sutimlimab due to non-serious event of infusion-related reaction. Of the 10 patients who 
participated in the BIVV009-01 C and E studies, none of them discontinued sutimlimab due 
to an event suggestive of potential hypersensitivity reaction.
History of prior allergic reaction to sutimlimab and/or its excipients; Atopic individuals. 
Exclusion of subjects with history of prior allergic reaction to sutimlimab or its excipients, 
close monitoring during infusions and slowing the infusion time as needed may help prevent 
hypersensitivity reactions in subjects receiving sutimlimab. Patients and HCPs should be 
informed of the signs and symptoms of hypersensitivity reactions to facilitate early diagnosis, 
and potentially mitigate the potential risk and serious outcomes. 
Serious hypersensitivity reactions and anaphylaxis are established potential complications of 
mAb therapy. Appropriate measures are in place as part of routine clinical practice: 
Hypersensitivity to sutimlimab or its components will be a contraindication to sutimlimab use. 
Based on limited therapy choices for CAD patients and available data, the benefit-risk 
remains positive.
There is no public health impact.

III.1 
ROUTINE PHARMACOVIGILANCE ACTIVITIES  
The following routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse reactions reporting and signal 
detection will be/are in place, including: 
 Specific adverse reaction follow-up questionnaires for: 
-
Infections (including serious infections and meningococcal infections)
- Autoimmune disorders (including SLE)
-
Serious hypersensitivity reactions and/or anaphylaxis
III.2 
ADDITIONAL PHARMACOVIGILANCE ACTIVITIES  
An ongoing cold-agglutinin disease-specific registry (Cadence) has been implemented by the 
marketing authorization holder (MAH) as the Sponsor to collect longitudinal data in patients with 
cold agglutinin disease in order to better understand patient and clinical characteristics, disease 
progression, complications, treatment impact, and patient-reported outcomes. While not a 
product-specific registry for sutimlimab, this registry will be used to conduct a post-approval 
non-interventional safety and effectiveness study of sutimlimab in patients with CAD (cohort 
study). Due to the limitations inherent to the rarity of CAD, the future uptake of sutimlimab within 
the registry population, and therefore the size of this cohort study, the approach will remain 
descriptive on the safety endpoints and effectiveness endpoints. The registry will also capture data 
on the vaccination status and dates of vaccination for all patients, including the patients who will 
get exposed to sutimlimab.  
In addition, to describe the distribution, understanding and impact on action of the educational tool 
(Physician’s Guide), which is an aRMM proposed to address the potential risks of meningococcal 
infections and serious infections in relation to sutimlimab treatment, a survey will be carried. It will 
target the population of physicians who treat patients with CAD and may intend to prescribe 
sutimlimab in the European countries included in this survey. This survey may involve 
approximately 50 physicians with possibly arround 10 HCPs having actually prescribed sutimlimab 
(depending on future uptake of sutimlimab), in a self-administered way, and start between 6 and 
18 months after distribution of Physician’s Guide. For the physicians who will have already 
prescribed sutimlimab, the survey will describe the implementation of vaccination (if vaccination 
status of patients has been checked, if vaccinations have been performed), and if patients have been 
counselled regarding course of action should early signs and symptoms of serious infections or 
meningococcal infections occur. The survey may be conducted in up to two waves. In the event that 
the survey has been open for 6 months in all countries and 30 completed surveys have not been 
achieved, with a minimum of 10 of those having been completed by HCP prescribers, a second 
wave of the survey will be conducted 6 to 12 months later.

Cold Agglutinin Disease Real World Evidence Registry (Cadence)
Rationale and study objectives: 
Rationale:  
The aim of this disease registry is to develop an international database of patients with CAD and CAS to prospectively 
collect longitudinal data and better understand patient and clinical characteristics, disease progression, complications 
(including TE events), treatment impact, and patient-reported outcomes.  
All patients with CAD and CAS will be eligible, regardless of the type of CAD-specific therapy they are receiving.  
In addition, the registry will be used to conduct a post-approval safety and effectiveness study of sutimlimab in patients with 
CAD and CAS (as off-label use of sutimlimab) as a drug cohort study. 
Objectives of the drug cohort study:  
The safety objective of the post-approval safety and effectiveness cohort study of sutimlimab is: 
 To describe the long-term safety of sutimlimab in the treatment of patients with CAD in a real-world setting (including 
CAS patients with off-label use of sutimlimab). 
Study design: 
Multinational, multi-center, observational, prospective, longitudinal registry study designed to collect data on patients with 
CAD and CAS. 
This registry study will be conducted in Austria, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, UK and the US, at sites known to 
treat and follow-up patients with CAD and CAS. 
Patients will be followed up throughout the registry duration, for up to 3 years after the last patient is enrolled in the disease 
registry. In total, patients will be followed up for up to 6 years (3-year enrollment period + at least 3 years of follow-up for all 
patients). 
Study populations: 
Patient aged >18 years, with a diagnosis of CAD and willing and able to provide written informed consent to participate in 
the registry. 
The disease registry study plans to enroll approximately 400 patients with CAD or CAS. Among them, at least 30 patients 
with CAD treated with sutimlimab are expected to be enrolled in the drug cohort study (with safety data collection including 
also off-label CAS patients). 
The registry size is constrained by feasibility aspects, and for the patients exposed to sutimlimab, the estimate is based on 
projections about the potential future uptake of sutimlimab in the CAD population.

FINAL 
Version 1.2 
DLP of this part: 25-JAN-2022 
Rationale and study objectives:  
The overall goal of this study is to perform an effectiveness evaluation of the sutimlimab Physician’s Guide among 
physicians who treat patients with CAD.  
Main objectives are to describe physician’s reported levels of receipt and reading of the Physician’s Guide and assess the 
physicians’ knowledge levels of key information included in the ENJAYMO™ Physician’s Guide.  
In addition, among the physicians who will have already prescribed sutimlimab, the survey will describe impact of the 
Physician’s Guide on the clinical actions associated with vaccination (if vaccination status of patients has been checked, if 
vaccinations have been performed), and if patients have been counselled regarding course of action should early signs and 
symptoms of serious infections or meningococcal infections occur. 
Study design:  
Non-interventional, cross-sectional survey study to evaluate the effectiveness of the Physician’s Guide among physicians 
who treat patients with CAD and may prescribe sutimlimab. Countries may include: Austria, Germany, Italy and the 
Netherlands.  
The survey is planned to be conducted in one wave between 6 and 18 months, after the distribution of the sutimlimab
Physician’s Guide. 
The survey may be conducted in up to two waves. In the event that the survey has been open for 6 months in all countries 
and 30 completed surveys have not been achieved, with a minimum of 10 of those having been completed by HCP 
prescribers, a second wave of the same survey will be conducted 6 to 12 months later. 
Study population and study size: 
Study population:
This survey will be conducted amongst HCPs from included countries who treat CAD (potential prescribers) and were sent 
the Physician’s Guide. 
Study size:  
The sample size was determined based on both feasibility and statistical considerations, giving the rarity of CAD and 
therefore anticipated low number of actual sutimlimab prescribers. A sample of 50 completed surveys is targeted for this 
study, with possibly around 10 HCPs having actually prescribed sutimlimab (this number depends on uptake of sutimlimab 
and is difficult to predict).

ADDITIONAL RISK MINIMIZATION MEASURES  
In addition to routine risk minimization measures, an educational tool for physicians, a “Physician’s 
Guide” and an educational tool for patients, a “Patient’s Guide” are proposed to further support the 
safe use of sutimlimab with regards to the important identified risk of serious infections and the 
important potential risk of meningococcal infections.  
These tools will be distributed to potential prescribers of sutimlimab at the product’s launch and 
will be made available thereafter through appropriate channels. 
Details about the Physician’s Guide and the Patient’s Guide are provided in Table 24. Proposed key 
messages to be conveyed by the tools are provided in [Annex 6].

Physician’s Guide 
Objectives 
Rationale for the additional 
risk minimization activity 
Educate physicians that patients should be vaccinated (according to most current local 
vaccination guidelines for vaccine use in patients with persistent complement 
deficiencies) prior to initiating sutimlimab. 
Recommend on-treatment monitoring for early signs and symptoms of infection. 
Recommend individualized patient counselling. 
Risks addressed: Serious infection and meningococcal infections. 
Serious infection, which may result in death or be life-threatening, can be reduced or 
prevented with an appropriate program of prophylactic vaccination.  
Informing HCPs (and patients via HCPs) of signs and symptoms may facilitate early 
diagnosis and treatment.  
Immediate treatment and management could prevent serious outcomes.

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK 
MANAGEMENT PLAN  
Summary of risk management plan for ENJAYMO (Sutimlimab) 
This is a summary of the RMP for ENJAYMO. The RMP details important risks of ENJAYMO 
how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained about ENJAYMO’s 
risks. 
ENJAYMO’s SmPC and its PIL give essential information directed to HCPs and patients on how 
ENJAYMO should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for ENJAYMO should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European public assessment report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of ENJAYMO’s 
RMP. 
I. 
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR  
ENJAYMO is authorized for treatment of hemolytic anemia in adult patients with CAD (see SmPC 
for the full indication). It contains sutimlimab as the active substance and it is given by 
intravenous (IV) route. 
Further information about the evaluation of ENJAYMO’s benefits can be found in ENJAYMO’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European medicines agency 
(EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/enjaymo
II.  RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO MINIMIZE OR 
FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THE RISKS  
Important risks of ENJAYMO, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about ENJAYMO’s risks, are outlined in the next sections.  
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the PL 
and SmPC addressed to patients and HCPs; 

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
 
RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - Part VI 
BIVV009 - Sutimlimab 
FINAL 
Version 1.2 
DLP of this part: 25-JAN-2022 
 The authorized pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
 The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In the case of ENJAYMO, routine risk minimization measures are supplemented with aRMMs 
mentioned under relevant important risks, outlined in the next sections. 
In addition to the risk minimization measures, information about adverse reactions is collected 
continuously and regularly analyzed, including periodic safety update report (PSUR) assessment so 
that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
II.A  List of important risks and missing information  
Important risks of ENJAYMO are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of ENJAYMO. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has 
not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on 
the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the 
long-term use of the medicine);

antibody complexes, phagocytosis and pathogen neutralization or killing. (49)(50) While 
the CP plays an essential role for bacterial killing, particularly gram negative or 
encapsulated organisms, complement activation also occurs with other pathogens, such 
as viruses. (51) 
Risk factors for serious infections may include: patients that are unvaccinated or 
incompletely vaccinated; exposure to other immunomodulatory agents; concurrent 
hematologic and/or solid organ malignancies; other inherited or acquired 
immunodeficiency; asplenia; HIV/AIDS; CSF leak; cochlear implants; poorly controlled

Risk minimization measures
Mechanism of action, class effect seen with terminal complement inhibitors and 
literature findings in subjects with acquired or inherited classical and terminal 
complement deficiency. 
The complement system is part of our innate immunity and consists of three pathways 
(classical, lectin and alternative). The complement system has multiples roles in both 
innate and adaptive immunity. Pharmacologic inhibition or inherited deficiency of the 
components of the complement pathway may lead to impaired opsonization of antigen 
antibody complexes, phagocytosis and pathogen neutralization or killing. Terminal 
complement inhibition may prevent the formation of the membrane attack complex 
which is integral to the killing of N. meningitidis. (49)(50)  
Risk factors for meningococcal infections may include: patients that are unvaccinated or 
incompletely vaccinated against meningococcus, including serogroup B; exposure to 
terminal complement inhibitor therapies; other inherited or acquired immunodeficiency; 
asplenia; elderly.

Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Mechanism of action and literature findings in subjects with acquired or inherited 
classical complement deficiency.  
Long-term CP inhibition could theoretically increase the risk of SLE due to the role of 
the C1 complex in immune complex clearance, as seen in patients with congenital 
deficiencies of C1 complex components (C1q, C1s, and C1r). C4 and C1q deficiency 
identified as the strongest genetic risk factors for SLE. (52)(61)  
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients that have concurrent autoimmune disease, pre-existing autoantibodies.

Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Class effect with mAbs (literature); mechanism of action.  
Large protein molecules, despite humanization, can be immunogenic. Sutimlimab is 
biologic therapeutic protein and hypersensitivity risk, including anaphylaxis, is 
considered a class effect with mAbs. Serious hypersensitivity reactions, including 
anaphylaxis, have been observed with other mAbs. Inhibition of CP doesn’t prevent LP 
or AP activation, which may produce potent anaphylatoxins.
Risk factors and risk groups 
History of prior allergic reaction to sutimlimab and/or its excipients; Atopic individuals.

 The Summary of Product Characteristics 
 The Physician’s Guide  
1.1 The Physician’s Guide:
Relevant information on the safety concerns addressed by the additional risk 
minimization measure (aRMM)  
Sutimlimab targets the classical complement pathway specifically binding to complement 
component 1, s subcomponent (C1s) preventing the cleavage of complement 
component 4 (C4); although the lectin and alternate pathways remain unaffected, patients 
may have an increased susceptibility to serious infections, especially infections caused by 
encapsulated bacteria such as Neisseria meningitidis, Streptococcus pneumoniae and 
Haemophilus influenza.  
In clinical studies, serious infections have been reported in patients receiving treatment 
with sutimlimab (see Product Monograph).  
This risk can be reduced or prevented with an appropriate program of prophylactic 
vaccinations. Informing HCPs and patients of signs and symptoms may facilitate early 
diagnosis and treatment. Immediate treatment and management could prevent serious 
outcomes.
Details on how to minimize the safety concerns addressed by the aRMM 
-
Immunization 
Immunize patients without a prior history of completed vaccination (or if the interval from 
the prior vaccination requires revaccination based on local guidelines) against 
encapsulated bacteria at least 2 weeks prior to receiving the first dose of sutimlimab. This 
should include meningococcal conjugate vaccine(s) and meningococcal serogroup B 
vaccine(s) when recommended and available, as well as the recommended pneumococcal 
vaccine(s). 
If urgent sutimlimab therapy is indicated in a patient without a history of completed 
vaccination, administer vaccine(s) as soon as possible. Comply with the current local 
vaccination guidelines for vaccine use in patients with persistent complement deficiencies. 
Revaccinate patients in accordance with these guidelines, considering the duration of 
sutimlimab therapy. 
The benefits and risks of antibiotic prophylaxis for prevention of infections in patients 
receiving sutimlimab have not been established.
- Monitoring patients 
Monitor patients closely for early signs and symptoms of infections such as meningitis, 
sepsis and pneumonia, evaluate immediately if infection is suspected and treat as 
appropriate.
 
RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART VII 
BIVV009 - Sutimlimab 
FINAL 
Version 1.2 
DLP of this part: 25-JAN-2022 
If sutimlimab treatment is administered to patients with active systemic infections, 
monitor closely for signs and symptoms of worsening infection. Use caution when 
treating patients with serious infections, chronic systemic infections (such as Hepatitis B 
or C or human immuno-deficiency virus [HIV]) or those who may be 
immunocompromised. 
- Key safety messages to convey in patients counselling  
Patients treated with sutimlimab may have an increased susceptibility to serious infections 
caused by certain bacteria. Patients need to receive vaccinations against infections caused 
by certain bacteria before their first dose of sutimlimab. They may need to have additional 
vaccinations during treatment with sutimlimab. Vaccinations may reduce the risk of these 
infections but do not prevent all infections. 
Patients should seek immediate medical attention if they suspect they may have an 
infection or develop any of the following symptoms: headache with nausea or vomiting, 
headache with a stiff neck or stiff back, headache and a fever, fever, chills, fever and rash, 
muscle aches with flu-like symptoms, confusion, eyes sensitive to light, cough/difficulty 
breathing. 
Remarks on the importance of reporting on specific adverse reactions: 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorization of the medicinal product is 
important. It allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal 
product. Healthcare professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions 
especially infections.

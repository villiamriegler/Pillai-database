Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for etelcalcetide, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
A cumulative review of data from post-marketing sources (as of 10 November 2017) identified a total of 
55  hypersensitivity  and  infusion-site  reactions.  Of  these,  seven  cases  were  serious,  including  one  case 
with a fatal outcome. In two of the serious cases, the anaphylactic reaction and face swelling occurred 
after  administration  of the  first  dose of  etelcalcetide.  Based  on  the  available  data  and  considering that 
the  active  substance  is  a  peptide,  the  causal  relationship  between  the  hypersensitivity  reactions  and 
etelcalcetide was considered likely. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for etelcalcetide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing etelcalcetide is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

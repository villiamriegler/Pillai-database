1.  Introduction 
On  2  June  2023,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  (study  20120215)  for 
blinatumomab, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
This  was  a  Randomized,  Open-label,  Controlled  Phase  3  Trial  to  Investigate  the  Efficacy,  Safety,  and 
Tolerability  of  the  BiTE  Antibody  Blinatumomab  as  Consolidation  Therapy  Versus  Conventional 
Consolidation  Chemotherapy  in  Pediatric  Subjects  With  High-risk  First  Relapse  B-precursor  Acute 
Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL). 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The  MAH  stated  that  Study  20120215  a  Randomized,  Open-label,  Controlled  Phase  3  Trial  to 
Investigate  the  Efficacy,  Safety,  and  Tolerability  of  the  BiTE  Antibody  Blinatumomab  as  Consolidation 
Therapy  Versus  Conventional  Consolidation  Chemotherapy  in  Pediatric  Subjects  With  High-risk  First 
Relapse  B-precursor  Acute  Lymphoblastic  Leukemia  (ALL)  is  a  stand-alone  study.  No  changes  to  the 
product labelling are proposed. 
In  addition,  study  20120215  is  classified  as  a  Category  3  Post-Authorization  Safety  Study  (PASS)  in 
the Blincyto risk management plan (RMP). The due date for the final report was expected in July 2024, 
the RMP will be updated at the next opportunity. 
The study 20120215 is part of the blinatumomab European Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP).  
Updated data were submitted within the renewal application and efficacy results were in line with those 
reported and analysed within the type II EMEA/H/C/003731/II/0038 extension of indication variation. 
At this time no new clinical efficacy data are considered to modify the clinical efficacy profile to date. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study<ies> 
Blincyto  is  brand  name  for  Blinatumomab.  Blinatumomab  was  supplied  as  single-use  glass  injection 
vials containing a sterile, preservative-free, white to off-white, lyophilized powder for IV administration 
after reconstitution with sterile water for injection. 
Blinatumomab was administered using infusion pumps approved for use by the appropriate regulatory 
authorities for the country in which the subject was undergoing treatment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Blinatumomab was approved in the European Union as an orphan medicinal product on November 25, 
2015 in the following indication: treatment of adults with Philadelphia chromosome negative relapsed 
or refractory B-precursor ALL. 
Blinatumomab was approved on July 26, 2018 for the treatment of paediatric patients aged 1 year or 
older  with  Philadelphia  chromosome  negative  CD19  positive  B-precursor  ALL  which  is  refractory  or  in

relapse  after  receiving  at  least  two  prior  therapies  or  in  relapse  after  receiving  prior  allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (AlloHSCT). 
Blinatumomab  was  approved  on  January  18,  2019,  for  the  treatment  of  adults  with  Philadelphia 
chromosome-negative  CD19  positive  B  precursor  ALL  in  first  or  second  complete  remission  with 
minimal residual disease (MRD) greater than or equal to 0.1% for BLINCYTO monotherapy. 
Blinatumomab was approved on 21 June 2021 for the treatment of of paediatric patients aged 1 year 
or older with high-risk first relapsed Philadelphia chromosome negative CD19 positive B-precursor ALL 
as part of the consolidation therapy.

Methods 
Objectives and endpoints 
The primary objective of the study was event free survival (EFS) after blinatumomab when compared 
to standard of care (SOC) chemotherapy as calculated from the time of randomization until the date of 
relapse or M2 marrow (bone marrow blast percentage (≥ 5% and < 25% blasts) after having achieved 
a  complete  remission  (CR),  failure  to  achieve  a  CR  at  the  end  of  treatment,  second  malignancy,  or 
death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. 
The secondary objectives of the study were to evaluate: 
•  The  effect  of  blinatumomab  on  overall  survival  (OS)  when  compared  to  SOC  chemotherapy. 
Overall survival was calculated from time of randomization until death due to any cause. 
•  Reduction  in  minimal  residual  disease  (MRD)  after  blinatumomab  when  compared  to  SOC 
chemotherapy. The endpoints were: 
o  Minimal residual disease response, defined as MRD level < 10-4 at the end of treatment 
with investigational products.  
o  Cumulative incidence of relapse. 
•  The  safety  of  blinatumomab  when  compared  to  SOC  chemotherapy.  The  endpoints  were 
incidence  of  adverse  events  (both  serious,  and  non-serious),  treatment  related  adverse 
events, adverse events of interest, clinically significant changes in laboratory values 
•  The  safety  of  alloHSCT  after  blinatumomab  when  compared  to  alloHSCT  after  SOC 
chemotherapy. The endpoints were: 
o  Survival status at 100 days following alloHSCT 
o 
Incidence of anti-blinatumomab antibody formation (blinatumomab arm only) 
•  The PK of blinatumomab. The endpoints were: 
o  Pharmacokinetic sampling for blinatumomab concentrations for population PK analysis 
o  Blinatumomab steady state concentrations 
Study design 
Study 20120215 is a randomized, open-label, controlled, multicentre, phase 3 in paediatric subjects (> 
28 days and < 18 years of age) with Philadelphia chromosome negative high-risk (HR) first relapse B-
precursor  ALL  (as  defined  by  International  Berlin  Frankfurt-Muenster  study  arm  [I-BFM-
SG]/International Study for Treatment of HR Childhood Relapsed ALL [IntReALL] criteria).  
After induction therapy and 2 blocks of high-risk consolidation (HC) chemotherapy, paediatric subjects 
with HR first relapse B-cell ALL were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either blinatumomab arm (Arm 1A) 
or a third block of standard high risk consolidation (HC3) chemotherapy (Arm 2A).

R = Randomization; HC = high-risk consolidation; HSCT = hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
Figure 1. Study Design and Treatment Schema 
The study design included the following: 
-  An  up  to  3  weeks  screening  visit:  It  occurs  after  induction  therapy  and  2  blocks  of  high-risk 
consolidation  (HC)  chemotherapy,  to  evaluate  eligibility  of  the  subject  and  perform 
randomization according to age and marrow status of patients at the end of HC2. 
- 
Treatment  period:  Patients  receive  a  single  consolidation  cycle  with  blinatumomab  or  HC3. 
During  this  period,  subjects  who  are  in  or  achieve  cytomorphological  CR2  (M1  marrow)  after 
completing  consolidation  therapy,  in  any  treatment  arm,  will  undergo  alloHSCT.  Visits  are 
performed on Days 1, 15 and Day 29/End-of-treatment.  
- 
Follow-up period: Two safety follow-up periods were performed from 7 days before alloHSCT to 
36  months  after  alloHSCT  or  died,  whichever  occurred  first.  After  reaching  the  primary 
endpoint, subjects were followed directly in the long-term follow-up period. 
o  A  short-term  efficacy  follow-up  period  of  12  months  after  alloHSCT:  visits  were 
performed at 45 days, 90 days, 6 months, 9 months, and 12 months after alloHSCT. 
o  A long-term follow-up period : visit were performed by telephone and/or e-mail contact 
to  assess  disease  and  survival  status  every  3  months  (+/-  2  weeks)  until  the  last 
subject on study either was followed for 36 months after alloHSCT or died, whichever 
occurred first. 
Study population/ Sample size 
The  study  aimed  to  observe  94  EFS  events  in  approximately  202  randomized  subjects.  The  following 
operating characteristics were based on 5000 simulations using a 2-sided log-rank test with an overall 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/482851/2023

2-sided  type  1  error  of  5%,  a  1:1  randomization  ratio,  exponentially  distributed  EFS  times  for  non-
cured subjects, and a uniform enrollment period of 48 months. 
If the control arm (HC3 group; Arm 2A) were to have a true cure rate of 40% and a median EFS of 7 
months among noncured subjects (Amgen data on file) and the treatment group (blinatumomab; Arm 
1A)  were  to  have  a  true  cure  rate  of  56.2%  and  a  median  EFS  of  11.1  months  among  noncured 
subjects  (a  noncured  hazard  ratio  of  0.63),  then  approximately  84%  of  the  simulations  would  have 
produced a statistically significant result (power). Under the assumption of no-treatment effect (a 40% 
cure  rate  and  a  median  EFS  of  7  months  for  all  the  arms),  the  probability  of  detecting  a  significant 
result in favor of blinatumomab (Arm 1A) was approximately 2.3%, which was similar to the planned 
type  1  error.  To  observe  94  events,  approximately  202  subjects  were  to  be  randomized  during  an 
approximate 48-month enrollment period with each subject followed until the last subject on study that 
either  was  followed  for  36  months  after  alloHSCT,  or  died,  whichever  occurred  first.  Two  interim 
analyses were planned to assess benefit when approximately 50% and 75% of the total number of EFS 
events have been observed.  
Stopping  for  benefit  was  based  on  the  O’Brien-Fleming  (O’Brien  and  Fleming,  1979)  member  of  the 
family  of  Lan-DeMets  (Lan  and  DeMets,  1983)  alpha  spending  functions;  the  critical  p-values 
corresponding to this spending function were 0.0031 for the 50% interim analysis, 0.0183 for the 75% 
interim  analysis,  and  0.044  for  the  primary  analysis,  if  the  interim  analyses  occurred  precisely  at  47 
events (50%) and 71 events (75%).  
To  preserve  the  overall  significance  level,  statistical  testing  followed  hierarchical  structure.  First,  the 
EFS was tested. If blinatumomab demonstrated superiority to SOC chemotherapy for EFS then OS was 
tested.  Hierarchical  testing  was  only  to  be  carried  out  at  the  primary  analysis  (ie,  final  analysis); 
testing  of  OS  at  the  interim  analysis  was  considered  descriptive.  Testing  of  the  other  secondary 
endpoints  was  considered  descriptive.  An  independent  DMC  external  to  Amgen  oversaw  the  first 
preplanned interim analyses and also assessed safety at regular intervals. 
Assessor’s comment 
The planned sample size was 202 subjects. However, on 17 July 2019, the DMC recommended to stop 
enrolment  for  benefit  in  the  blinatumomab  arm,  and  only  continue  with  treatment  and  long-term 
follow-up for those already enrolled on the study per the protocol-specified follow-up period. The MAH 
accepted the DMC’s recommendation. Thus, a total of 108 patients was enrolled (54 per study arm). 
Treatments  
Blinatumomab was administered as continuous intravenous infusion (CIVI) to patients in Arm 1A.  One 
cycle of blinatumomab treatment included 4 weeks of CIVI of blinatumomab dosed at a constant daily 
flow rate of 15 μg/m2/day over 4 weeks (maximum daily dose not exceeded 28 µg/day), followed by 
14 days without dosing, as per the agreed PIP.

Figure 2. Blinatumomab Treatment Cycle 
For  subjects  randomized  in  the  Arm  2A,  a  standard  intensive  consolidation  chemotherapy  treatment, 
known  as  HC3,  was  administered  over  1  week.  It  includes  a  combination  of  chemotherapies  detailed 
below. 
Figure 3. Dosage, Administration, and Schedule 
For  patients,  study  duration  included  a  3-week  screening  period,  a  4-week  treatment  period  (for  the 
blinatumomab arm:  1 consolidation cycle of blinatumomab; for the HC3 arm:  1 consolidation cycle of 
HC3), followed by a 1 week safety follow-up period prior to alloHSCT, a 12 months short-term efficacy 
follow-up, and a long-term follow-up that continued until the last subject on study either was followed 
for 36 months after alloHSCT or died, whichever occurred first. 
Assessor’s comment 
Blinatumomab was given in accordance with the approved scheme regimen. 
Statistical Methods 
The  primary  analysis  was  planned  to  test  whether  EFS  was  superior  in  the  blinatumomab  arm 
compared with the HC3 arm. At the first pre-planned interim analysis, the criteria for primary endpoint 
was  met  and  the  results  for  primary  analysis  (data  cutoff  date  of  17  July  2019)  are  presented  in  the 
primary  analysis  CSR  (dated,  27  April  2020).  The  secondary  endpoints  were  also  summarized  during 
the primary analysis.

Two  interim  analyses  were  planned  to  assess  benefit  when  approximately  50%  and  75%  of  the  total 
number of EFS events have been observed.  
The final analysis was planned to assess the potential long-term effect of blinatumomab on safety. The 
final analysis was triggered when the last subject enrolled in long-term follow-up was 36 months after 
alloHSCT or died, whichever occurred first. At the time of final analysis, the EFS and OS analyses were 
updated with additional follow-up data; these analyses were considered descriptive. If the last subject 
enrolled on study died or was lost to follow-up before 36 months after alloHSCT, the remainder of the 
subjects  on  study  were  followed  until  all  subjects  on  study  reached  36  months  after  alloHSCT,  until 
death  or  lost  to  follow-up,  which  triggered  the  final  analysis.  This  report  presents  the  results  of  the 
final analysis with last subject last visit date of 21 November 2022. 
Assessor’s comment 
In  EMEA-000574-PIP02-12-M03  procedure,  the  applicant  requested  the  addition  of  two  interim 
analyses  to  assess  benefit  when  47  (50%)  and  71  (75%)  events  were  observed  in  study  20120215, 
due  to  the  early  termination  of  recruitment  based  on  the  recommendation  of  the  DMC  because  of 
efficacy. 
The PDCO accepted the study design modification in view of the planned long-term follow-up of 
patients until all subjects on study have reached 36 months following alloHSCT, died or have been lost 
to follow-up, whichever occurred first. 
Results 
Recruitment and disposition of Subjects 
A  total  of  121  subjects  were  screened  and  111  were  randomized:  57  to  the  HC3  arm  and  54  to  the 
blinatumomab arm. Subject disposition in the Full Analysis Set is detailed on the Table 1.

Table 1. Subject Disposition (Full Analysis Set) 
At the time of final analysis, 56 subjects (50.5%) had at least 1 IPD (Table 2).

Table 2. Summary of Important Protocol Deviations (Full Analysis Set) 
The most common IPD was “missing data (other than the subjects that received the wrong treatment 
or  incorrect  dose  [TA]  or  other  treatment  compliance  [TC])”,  most  of  which  occurred  when  bone 
marrow samples were not sent for central review during treatment or short-term follow-up. The second 
and  third  most  common  IPDs  were  “off-schedule  procedures  (other  than  TA  or  TC)”  and  “other 
deviations”,  respectively.  The  nature  of  these  IPDs  were  primarily  administrative,  and  thus  did  not 
have significant impact on study efficacy or safety (Listing 16-2.2.1). 
The summary of randomization stratifications in the Full Analysis Set is presented in Table 3.

Randomization  of  subjects  was  stratified  by  age  (1  to  9  years;  other  [<  1  year  and  >  9  years]),  by 
bone marrow status determined at the end of HC2 and MRD status determined at the end of induction 
(M1 with MRD level < 10-3; M1 with MRD level < 10-3; and M2). 
Assessor’s comment 
The  HC3  arm  and  the  blinatumomab  arm  are  globally  the  same,  even  in  term  of  discontinuation.  On 
the  111  randomized  subjects,  5  discontinued  investigational  product  because  of  adverse  event  (1  in 
the HC3 arm and 2 in the blinatumomab arm) and requirement of an alternative therapy (2 in the HC3 
arm and none in the blinatumomab arm). 
Note that, there is a higher rate of HSCT in the blinatumomab arm (94.4%) compared to the HC3 arm 
(68.4%)  and  a  higher  rate  of  death  in  the  HC3  (47.4%)  arm  compared  to  the  blinatumomab  arm 
(18.5%). This data will be evaluated in the efficacy analysis. 
Regarding  protocol  deviations,  the  number  of  subjects  with  at  least  one  important  protocol  deviation 
was  similar  in  the  2  arms  (30  [52.6%]  in  the  HC3  arm  and  26  [48.1%]  in  the  blinatumomab  arm). 
Some  of  these  deviations,  such  as  Missing  Data  (Other  Than  TA  Or  TC)  (25.2%)  or  Off-Schedule 
Procedures (Other Than TA Or TC) (14.4%), were in the most recurrent. The majority of these missing 
data came from bone marrow samples that were not sent for central review during treatment or short-
term follow-up. However, the applicant states that all cytological evaluations of bone marrow collected 
from screening to the end of short-term follow-up were reviewed centrally by a laboratory or assessed 
by  PCR  and/or  flow  cytometry  when  no  central  examination  were  performed.  The  distribution  of  the 
type of tests performed on these marrows is presented in table 4. 
About  the  other  deviation  (16.2%),  there  were  essentially  subjects  who  did  not  sign  the  updated 
IRB/IEC-approved Informed Consent Form or other significant protocol or GCP deviation. 
Data  were  stratified  according  to  age  and  bones  marrow  status.  The  proportion  of  subjects  in  each 
sub-group of the stratification is similar. 
The overall results were consistent with those reported for the supplemental analysis.  
Baseline  demographic  characteristics  were  detailed  in  the  following  Table  4.  In  the  Full  Analysis  Set, 
approximately  half  of  the  subjects  were  females  (52.3%),  and  most  of  the  subjects  were  white 
(86.5%)  and  were  not  Hispanic  or  Latino  by  ethnicity  (96.4%).  The  median  (range)  age  was  5.0  (1, 
17) years, and majority of the subjects were in the age group of 1 to 9 years (72.1%).

Assessor’s comment 
Baseline  demographic  characteristics  were  generally  consistent  between  HC3  and  blinatumomab 
treatment  arms,  even  if  there  are  some  disparities,  particularly  in  terms  of  genetic  anomalies,  which 
are  not  distributed  in  the  same  way.  Some  genetic  abnormality  are  not  represented  in  the 
blinatumomab arm as the t(v;11q23)/MLL rearranged associated with a poor prognosis. 
Most  patients,  in  the  two  arms,  had  no  extramedullary  disease  at  the  time  of  primary  diagnosis.  At 
relapse,  the  proportion  of  extramedullary  disease  is  more  frequent  in  the  HC3  arms  (26.3%)  than  in 
the  blinatumomab  arm  (18.5%).  The  body  site  for  extramedullary  disease,  was  similar  between  the 
two arms. 
Concerning  the  central  bone  marrow  assessment,  equivalent  cytomorphology  rate  were  showed 
between the two arms. The majority of patients presented a cytomorphology M1 (Representative bone 
marrow  aspirate  or  biopsy  with  blasts  <  5%,  with  satisfactory  cellularity  and  with  regenerating 
hematopoiesis). 
There was a difference between the MRD rates of the two arms. More patients in the HC3 arm had a 
rate above the ≥10-4 threshold, whether measured by PCR or flow cytometry, with 15 subjects (26.3%) 
and 13 subjects (22.8%) respectively, compared with the blinatumomab arm with 10 subjects (18.5%) 
and 9 subjects (16.7%) respectively, which could reflect a higher relapse rate. 
In  addition,  there  was  a  non-negligible  proportion  of  MRD  PCR  (38.7%)  and  MRD  flow  cytometry 
(34.2%) not done.  
The  populations  of  the  two  arms  appear  to  be  balanced  and  the  overall  results  were  consistent  with 
those reported in the SmPC section 5.1.

The  sensitivity  analyses  for  EFS  to  evaluate  potential  bias  of  differing  cycle  lengths  between  the 
treatment arms showed that the results were similar to the results from the primary EFS analysis. The 
estimated hazard ratios within the treatment arms were all < 1 and directionally favored blinatumomab 
treatment. 
Secondary Endpoint:  
At the time of final analysis, 50.9% (29 of 57 subjects) in the HC3 arm and 79.6% (43 of 54 subjects) 
in the blinatumomab arm were alive at last follow-up visit and censored. The overall median follow-up 
time for OS was 55.2 months. The subject incidence of death was 49.1% in the HC3 arm and 20.4% in 
the blinatumomab arm; the treatment difference was statistically significant (p-value of 0.001 from the 
stratified log rank test). The results are presented in the Table 6.

A  total  of  63.2%  of  subjects  (36  of  57)  in  the  HC3  arm  and  29.6%  of  subjects  (16  of  54)  in  the 
blinatumomab  arm  had  either  relapse  or  death  due  to  disease  progression,  of  which  1  subject  had 
disease progression in the HC3 arm and none in the blinatumomab arm. The cumulative incidence of 
relapse hazard ratio from a stratified Cox proportional hazard model was 0.27 (95% CI: 0.15 to 0.48), 
indicating a 73% reduction in the risk of relapse in the blinatumomab arm. The median time to event 
was 7.9 months in the HC3 arm and not reached in the blinatumomab arm. The results from this final 
analysis were consistent with those reported for the primary analysis. 
Assessor’s comment 
About  the  primary  endpoint,  which  was  to  evaluate  EFS  after  blinatumomab  when  compared  to  SOC 
chemotherapy,  the  final  analysis  has  demonstrated  a  significantly  improvement  in  the  blinatumomab 
arm  when  compared  with  HC3  arm  (p  <  0.001  by  the  stratified  log-rank  test).  Indeed,  the  subject 
incidence of EFS events was 64.9% in the HC3 arm and 38.9% in the blinatumomab arm. 
The overall median follow-up time for EFS was 51.9 months. Median time to EFS in blinatumomab arm 
was not reached (95% CI:  24.8 months to non estimable  [NE] vs 7.8 months (95% CI: 5.8 to 13.4 
months)  in  HC3  arm)  and  the  EFS  hazard  ratio  from  a  stratified  Cox  proportional  hazard  model  was 
0.35 (95% CI: 0.20 to 0.61). 
The  36-month  Kaplan-Meier  estimate  was  27.6%  (95%  CI:    16.2%  to  40.3%)  in  the  HC3  arm  and 
63.3% (95% CI:  48.7% to 74.8%) in the blinatumomab arm. The hazard ratio obtained from a Cox 
proportional hazard model with a time dependent covariate (hazard ratio = 0.34; 95% CI:  0.20% to 
0.59%) was consistent with the hazard ratio provided above. 
These  subgroup  analyses  to  assess  potential  bias  between  treatment  groups  show  no  increase  in 
occurrence  in  any  of  the  subgroups,  and  indicate  a  lower  mean  event  rate  and  longer  EFS  for 
blinatumomab compared with HC3. 
About the key secondary efficacy endpoint, the median follow-up time for OS was 55.2 months for the 
overall population and was similar between treatment arms. The OS hazard ratio from a stratified Cox 
proportional  hazard  model  was  0.33  (95%  CI:  0.16  to  0.66)  and  the  median  time  to  OS  was  25.6 
months (95% CI:  17.5 months to NE) in the HC3 arm and not reached in the blinatumomab arm.   
The  36-month  Kaplan-Meier  estimate  was  49.0%  (95%  CI:  34.8%  to  61.8%)  in  the  HC3  arm  and 
80.8% (95% CI: 67.3% to 89.2%) in the blinatumomab arm.  
About the Minimal Residiual Disease Response, 53.1% of subjects in the HC3 arm and 93.9% subjects 
in the blinatumomab arm achieved an MRD response by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and 60.0% 
of subjects in the HC3 arm and 92.6% of subjects in the blinatumomab arm achieved an MRD response 
by flow cytometry. 
Blinatumomab  treatment  resulted  in  a  higher  MRD  response  when  compared  with  HC3  and  the  MRD 
response results by flow cytometry were consistent with the MRD response results by PCR.   
About  the  AlloHSCT  and  the  survival  status  following  AlloHSCT,  82.5%  of  subjects  (47  of  57)  in  the 
HC3 arm and 94.4% of subjects (51 of 54) in the blinatumomab arm received an AlloHSCT.  
The median time to transplant was 1.7 months (range: 1 to 4 months) in the HC3 arm and 1.9 months 
(range:  1 to 3 months) in the blinatumomab arm. 
At  time  of  100  days  post-transplant,  the  mortality  rates  reach  3.9  (95%  CI:  1.0  to  14.8)  in  the 
blinatumomab arm and 5.1 (95% CI: 1.3 to 19.0) in the HC3 arm. The Kaplan-Meier median time to 
death  was  1558.0  days  in  the  HC3  arm  (95%  CI:  431.0  days  to  NE)  and  not  reached  in  the 
blinatumomab arm (95% CI: NE, NE).

Pharmacokinetics Results 
Blinatumomab was administered through continuous intravenous (IV) infusion at 15 µg/m2/day over a 
4-week treatment period. Two PK samples were collected per subject on day 1 (at least 10 hours after 
infusion start and up to 24 hours) and on day 15. Comparison of PK parameters in pediatric patients 
from Studies 20130265, Study MT103-205, and Study 20120215 (current study) are provided in Table 
10.  During  continuous  IV  infusion  of  15  µg/m2/day  to  pediatric  subjects,  the  mean  (+SD)  of 
blinatumomab  steady-state  concentrations  (Css)  was  884  (969)  pg/mL  while  the  mean  (+SD)  of 
clearance  (CL)  was  1.14  (0.836)  L/m2/hr.  The  intersubject  variability,  as  assessed  by  percent 
coefficient  of  variation  in  the  PK  parameter  estimates,  was  up  to  110%.  Given  the  high  observed 
intersubject variability in this study, mean (SD) Css and CL of blinatumomab were generally within the 
range of those previously reported in pediatric subjects from Study 20130265 and Study MT103-205.  
Table 10. Pharmacokinetic Parameters of Blinatumomab in Pediatric Subjects With 
Relapsed or Refractory ALL and High-risk First Relapsed B-cell ALL 
In addition, blinatumomab CL values of subjects with high-risk first relapsed ALL and baseline MRD < 
10-3  were  within  range  of  those  from  the  corresponding  subjects  with  baseline  MRD  ≥  10-3. 
Corresponding  analysis  comparing  CL  values  of  subjects  who  had  baseline  MRD  <  10-4  and  ≥  10-4 
showed similar results. 
No analyses of the relationship between PK and safety data were planned or conducted. 
The  PK  results  from  the  final  analysis  were  consistent  with  the  results  of  the  primary  analysis  given 
that:

• 
the  PK  results  reported  for  the  final  analysis  remain  the  same  as  those  presented  in  the 
supplemental  CSR  as  no  new  PK  data  have  been  generated  since  the  data  cutoff  date  of  the 
aforementioned report. 
• 
the PK results of the supplemental CSR were consistent with those from the primary analysis. 
Assessor’s comment 
The PK results were observed by the laboratory on a population with high intersubject variability 
(110%). Such inter-subject variability is not exceptional. The applicant states that the results observed 
in the latest study are within the range of previous observations: Studies 20130265, Study MT103-205 
which is generally expected. 
Anti-blinatumomab Antibody Assays 
Of the 54 subjects in the blinatumomab arm who were included in the Safety Analysis Set, 52 subjects 
(52 of 54; 96.2%) had a postbaseline antibody result; none of the subjects tested positive for binding 
or  neutralizing  antiblinatumomab  antibodies.  Therefore,  analyses  evaluating 
the  effect  of 
antiblinatumomab antibodies on PK were not conducted.  
Safety results 
At the time of final analysis, the mean (SD) duration of blinatumomab treatment was 27.0 (5.2) days, 
and the median cumulative blinatumomab dose was 419.4 µg/m2.  
A total of 96.2% of subjects (50 of 52) in the HC3 arm and 100.0% (54 of  54) in the blinatumomab 
arm had treatment-emergent adverse events as presented in the Table 11.

Concerning the most frequently reported treatment-emergent adverse events in the overall:   
• 
• 
In  the  HC3  arm,  adverse  events  with  a  subject  incidence  ≥  25%  by  PT  were  stomatitis 
febrile 
(53.8%),  anemia  (46.2%),  neutropenia  (30.8%),  and  thrombocytopenia  and 
neutropenia (25.0% each).  
In the blinatumomab arm, adverse events with a subject incidence ≥ 25% by PT were pyrexia 
(81.5%), nausea (42.6%), headache (37.0%), and vomiting (31.5%).  
The highest subject incidence of treatment-related treatment-emergent adverse events were in system 
organ class of general disorders and administration site conditions (11.5% [6 of 52] for the HC3 arm 
and 59.3% [32 of 54] in for the blinatumomab arm), blood and lymphatic system disorders (57.7% of

• 
Neurologic  Events: Fifteen subjects (28.8%) in the HC3 arm and 26 subjects (48.1%) in the 
blinatumomab arm had neurologic events. By PT, the most frequently reported neurologic event (HC3 
arm;  blinatumomab  arm)  was  headache  (9  subjects  [17.3%];  20  subjects  [37.0%]).  One  subject 
(1.9%)  in  the  HC3  arm  and  3  subjects  (5.6%)  in  the  blinatumomab  arm  had  neurologic  events  that 
were grade ≥ 3 in severity. In the HC3 arm, the grade 3 event by PT was confusional state in 1 subject 
(1.9%)  and  in  the  blinatumomab  arm,  the  grade  3  events  by  PT  were  nervous  system  disorder  and 
neuralgia (each in 1 subject [1.9%]), and a grade 4 event of seizure in 1 subject (1.9%). One subject 
(1.9%)  in  the  HC3  arm  and  5  subjects  (9.3%)  in  the  blinatumomab  arm  had  neurological  event  that 
were deemed serious. The serious adverse event of interest by PT was headache in 1 subject (1.9%) of 
the HC3 arm and it resolved. The serious adverse events of interest by PT were neurological symptom 
and  seizure  (each  in  2  subjects  [3.7%]),  and  nervous  system  disorder  (1  subject  [1.9])  of  the 
blinatumomab arm and all the events were resolved. 
• 
Cytokine  Release  Syndrome: One subject (1.9%) in the HC3 arm and 2 subjects (3.7%) in 
the  blinatumomab  arm  had  CRS;  the  PT  for  all  of  these  events  was  CRS.  No  events  were  deemed 
grade ≥ 3 or serious adverse events for CRS.   
• 
Medication  Errors:  No  subject  (0.0%)  in  the  HC3  arm  and  1  subject  (1.9%)  in  the 
blinatumomab  arm  had  medication  errors.  The  event  by  PT  was  accidental  overdose.  This  event  was 
deemed grade 2 and serious by the investigator and it resolved. 
All  results  presented  above  for  this  final  analysis  were  similar  to  those  presented  for  the  primary 
analysis. 
Assessor’s comment 
Among  the  108  patients  who  received  a  dose  of  treatment,  all  patients  in  the  blinatumomab  arm 
(100%)  versus  96.2%  (50  of  52)  in  the  HC3  arm  experienced  treatment  emergent  adverse  events 
(TEAE). These proportions are globally the same. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs, for blinatumomab, were pyrexia (81.5% of subjects [44 of 54]), 
nausea  (42.6%  of  subjects  [23  of  54]),  headache  (37%  of  subjects  [20  of  54]),  vomiting  (31.5%  of 
subjects  [17  of  54]),  anaemia  (24.1%  of  subjects  [13  of  54]),  diarrhoea  and  stomatitis  (22.2%  of 
subjects [12 of 54] each) and are already known to be associated with the use of blinatumomab. 
The most frequently reported grade ≥ 3 TEAEs, for blinatumomab, were anemia (14.8% of subjects [8 
of  54]),  mucosal  inflammation  (13.0%  of  subjects  [7  of  54]),  platelet  count  decreased  (11.1%  of 
subjects [6 of 54]), neutropenia (9.3% of subjects [5 of 54]) and thrombocytopenia, neutrophil count 
decrease and white blood cell count decrease (7.4% of subjects [4 of 54] for each).  
The  most  frequently  reported  serious  adverse  events  (SAE),  for  blinatumomab,  were  neurological 
symptom and seizure (3.7% of subjects [2 of 54] each).  
In  terms  of  treatment-related  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  (TERAE),  the  overall  number  of 
subjects  in  each  arm  was  similar,  with  41  (78.8%  of  subjects  [41  of  54])  in  the  HC3  arm  and  45 
(83.3% of subjects [45 of 54]) in the blinatumomab arm and concerned  
These  proportions  are  no  longer  equivalent  for  the  grade  ≥  3  TERAEs,  and  are  lower  in  the 
blinatumomab arm (16.7% of subjects [9 of 54]) than in the HC3 arm (63.5% of subjects [33 of 54]). 
No treatment-related grade ≥ 3 adverse events with a subject incidence of ≥ 10% were reported for 
the  blinatumomab  arm  and  the  incidence  of  grade  ≥3  treatment-related  adverse  events  by  system 
organ  class  included:  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders  (3.7%  of  subjects  [2  of  54]  in  the 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

blinatumomab arm), and investigations (9.3% of subjects [5 of 54] in the blinatumomab arm) and are 
already known to be associated with the use of blinatumomab. 
These  proportions  are  also  different  for  serious  adverse  events,  and  are  lower  in  the  blinatumomab 
arm (16.7% of subjects [9 of 54]) than in the HC3 arm (28.8% of subjects [15 of 54]).  
In the blinatumomab arm, the TEAEs led to 6 discontinuations and 2 interruption of the investigational 
product  compared  with  HC3,  in  which  there  were  only  2  treatment  interruptions.  The  adverse  events 
leading to interruption of blinatumomab included nervous system disorder (3.7% of subjects [2 of 54]) 
and  seizure,  abdominal  pain,  accidental  overdose  and  neurological  examination  abnormal  (1.9%  of 
subjects [1 of 54] for each).  
Concerning  the  subject  incidence  of  treatment-related  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  were  in 
system  organ  class  of  general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (11.5%  [6  of  52]  for  the 
HC3 arm and 59.3% [32 of 54] in for the blinatumomab arm), blood and lymphatic system disorders 
(57.7%  of  subjects  [30  of  52]  in  the  HC3  arm  and  3.7%  of  subjects  [2  of  54]  in  the  blinatumomab 
arm), and gastrointestinal disorders (50.0% [26 of 52] for the HC3 arm and 25.9% [14 of 54] for the 
blinatumomab arm). 
These events are listed as very common Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) in the current SmPC, or part of 
the system organ class families.  
Concerning the key risks, there are consistent with the previous study (study 20130320) and already 
mentioned in the SmPC. 
The  types  and  frequencies  of  AEs  reported  were  globally  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of 
blinatumomab  and  concerned  population  of  subjects.  No  new  safety  signals  were  identified  in  this 
study.  
Deaths 
No  subject  had  treatment-emergent  fatal  adverse  events.  Between  the  data  cut  off  dates  of  the 
primary analysis and the  final analysis; no subject died while on the study, and 2 subjects died after 
end of the study.  
From all enrolled subjects (N = 111, Full Analysis Set), 37 subjects (33.0%) died while on study, (27 
subjects [47.4%] in the HC3 arm and 10 subjects [18.5%] in the blinatumomab arm) and 2 subjects 
died after end of the study (Table 1 Subject Disposition (Full Analysis Set)). Overall, the most frequent 
reason for death was due to disease progression in 29 subjects (74.4%; [29 of 39]) (Listing 16-2.7.3).  
Eight  subjects  who  died  (4  subjects  each  in  the  HC3  arm  and  blinatumomab  arm),  the  reasons  for 
death by PT  were: fungal sinusitis, CRS, recurrent acute lymphocytic leukemia, and acute respiratory 
failure,  (1  subject  each  in  the  HC3  arm);  infection,  hepatic  failure,  pneumonia,  and  hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis  (1  subject  each  in  the  blinatumomab  arm).  The  cause  of  death  was  not  reported 
(PT:  not  applicable;  2  subjects  [1  subject  each  in  the  HC3  and  blinatumomab  arm]).  The  8  deaths 
occurred between 51 and 1591 days after the last dose of investigational product.

The death due to recurrent acute lymphocytic leukemia occurred 1591 days after the last dose 
of HC3.  
The death due to hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis occurred 87 days after the last dose of 
blinatumomab.  
The death due to pneumonia occurred 99 days after the last dose of blinatumomab.  
The death due to hepatic failure occurred 162 days after the last dose of blinatumomab.  
The death due to infection occurred 291 days after the last dose of blinatumomab.  
None of these deaths were deemed by the investigator as related to HC3 or blinatumomab. 
3.  Overall conclusion and recommendation 
Study 20120215 was a randomized, open-label, controlled, multicentre, phase 3 in paediatric subjects 
(> 28 days and < 18 years of age) with Philadelphia chromosome negative high-risk (HR) first relapse 
B-precursor  ALL  (as  defined  by  International  Berlin  Frankfurt-Muenster  study  arm  [I-BFM-
SG]/International Study for Treatment of HR Childhood Relapsed ALL [IntReALL] criteria).  
The  planned  sample  size  was  202  subjects.  However,  the  recruitment  in  the  study  was  prematurely 
stopped on 17 July 2019 for efficacy in blinatumomab arm, based on DMC recommendation at time of 
first  interim  analysis  when  approximately  50%  of  the  total  EFS  events  had  occurred.  Thus,  a  total  of 
108 patients was enrolled (54 per study arm). 
The dosing regimen used is consistent with the one approved in the SmPC for Blinatumomab, and the 
population were globally the same. 
Regarding  efficacy  data,  the  EMEA-000574-PIP02-12-M03  report  underlined  the  importance  of  the 
planned long-term follow-up of patients until all  subjects on study have reached 36 months following 
alloHSCT, died or have been lost to follow-up, whichever occurred first. 
- 
The  EFS  has  demonstrated  a  significantly  improvement  in  the  blinatumomab  arm  when 
compared with HC3 arm. The 36-month Kaplan-Meier estimate was 27.6% (95% CI:  16.2% to 
40.3%) in the HC3 arm and 63.3% (95% CI:  48.7% to 74.8%) in the blinatumomab arm.  
- 
The median follow-up time for OS was 55.2 months for the overall population and was similar 
between treatment arms. The 36-month Kaplan-Meier estimate was 49.0% (95% CI: 34.8% to 
61.8%) in the HC3 arm and 80.8% (95% CI: 67.3% to 89.2%) in the blinatumomab arm.  
The EMEA/H/C/003731/II/0018 extension of indication procedure has also mentioned that the data on 
mortality  at  100  days  post-transplant  will  be  essential  for  judging  the  real  benefit  of  Blincyto  in  the 
paediatric population.  
-  At time of 100 days post-transplant, the mortality rates reach 3.9 (95% CI: 1.0 to 14.8) in the 
blinatumomab arm and 5.1 (95% CI:  1.3 to 19.0)  in the HC3 arm. The Kaplan-Meier median 
time to death was 1558.0 days in the HC3 arm (95% CI: 431.0 days to NE) and not reached in 
the blinatumomab arm (95% CI: NE, NE).

4.  Request for supplementary information 
Based  on  the  data  submitted,  the  MAH  should  address  the  following  questions  as  part  of  this 
procedure: 
Question 1. 
The  applicant  is  requested  to  update  the  section  5.1  of  the  SmPC  in  order  to  add  a  brief  text  to 
summarise  the  updated  efficacy  data,  also  in  terms  of  transplant  access  and  100-day  mortality. 
Indeed, these data might be informative to the prescribers. 
MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
Question 1: 
Amgen proposes to include the following text within Section 5.1 of the SmPC: 
The  overall  median  follow-up  time  for  EFS  was  51.9  months  (95%  CI:  47.2%,  62.1%).  In 
patients who received the SOC consolidation chemotherapy (HC3), the 36-month Kaplan-Meier 
estimate  of  EFS,  was  27.6% (95% CI:  16.2%,  40.3%)  compared  to  63.3%  (95% CI:  48.7%, 
74.8%)  in  patients  who  received  BLINCYTO  and  the  hazard  ratio  (95%  CI)  was  0.35  (0.20, 
0.61). 
The median follow-up time for OS was 55.2 months for the overall population and was similar 
between treatment arms. The 36-month Kaplan-Meier estimate was 49.0% (95% CI: 34.8% to 
61.8%)  in  the  chemotherapy  (HC3)  arm  and  80.8%  (95%  CI:  67.3%  to  89.2%)  in  the 
BLINCYTO  arm  and  the  hazard  ratio  (95%  CI)  was  0.33  (0.16,  0.66).  The  median  time  to 
transplant was 1.7 months (range: 1 to 4 months) in the HC3 arm and 1.9 months (range: 1 
to 3 months) in the BLINCYTO arm. 
A  numerically  higher  incidence  of  postbaseline  alloHSCT  was  reported  in  the  BLINCYTO  arm 
compared  with  the  HC3  arm;  82.5%  of  subjects  (47  of  57)  in  the  HC3  arm  and  94.4%  of

subjects (51 of 54) in the BLINCYTO arm. In the HC3 arm, 39 of 57 subjects (68.4%) received 
a transplant while in complete remission, whereas, 51 of 54 subjects (94.4%) in the BLINCYTO 
arm received a transplant while in complete remission. 
At time of 100 days post-transplant, the mortality rates reached 3.9 (95% CI: 1.0 to 14.8) in 
the  BLINCYTO  arm  and  5.1  (95%  CI:  1.3  to  19.0)  in  the  chemotherapy  (HC3)  arm.  The 
Kaplan-Meier median time to death was 1558.0 days in the HC3 arm (95% CI: 431.0 days to 
NE) and not reached in the blinatumomab arm (95% CI: NE, NE). 
Following  agreement  and  close  out  of  procedure  EMEA/H/C/003731/P46/014,  Amgen  intends  to 
implement the changes through a Type Ib variation. 
Assessor’s comment

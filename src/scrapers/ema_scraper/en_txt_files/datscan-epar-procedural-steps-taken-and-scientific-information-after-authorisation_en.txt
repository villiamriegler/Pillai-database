are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

patients with clinically uncertain Parkinsonian Syndromes 
presenting with early symptoms. This review was 
performed following a request from the CHMP. A 
clarification of the approved target population to include 
uncertain case of early Parkinsonian symptoms was 
implemented in section 4.1 of the SmPC.

aspects. This change is a follow-up measure as part 
of the MAH's post approval undertaking for renewal 
procedure EMEA/H/C/266/R/0033.

in this section. The following text will be included in section 
5.3: 
 "Non-clinical data for ioflupane reveal no special hazard for 
humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, single and repeated dose toxicity and 
genotoxicity. Studies on reproductive toxicity and to assess 
the carcinogenic potential of ioflupane have not been 
performed."

The MAH has submitted a variation to update section 4.8 of 
current SmPC and corresponding section of the PL 
with addition of reported adverse drug reactions and 
amended frequencies for existing undesirable effects 
based upon current data. This change is a follow-up 
measure as part of the MAH's post approval 
undertaking for renewal procedure

the SmPC and the corresponding section of the PL with 
additional adverse drug reactions (ADRs) and changes in 
frequency for currently included ADRs based on data from 
clinical trials with Datscan. This change is a follow up 
measure included in the MAH's post approval undertaking 
for a recent renewal procedure. The adverse reactions 
dizziness, nausea, dry mouth and dysgeusia have been 
added to section 4.8 of the SmPC with frequency 
'uncommon'. The PL has been amended accordingly.

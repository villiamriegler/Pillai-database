Update of sections 4.5, 4.6 and 5.2 of the SmPC to 
reflect the results of study 1199-0340 conducted in 
female patients with Systemic Sclerosis associated 
Interstitial Lung disease (SSc-ILD), to investigate a 
potential interaction between nintedanib and the oral 
contraceptive Microgynon, a combination of 
ethynilestradiol and levonorgestrel.   
Update of section 4.6 of the SmPC to reflect that 
patients receiving Vargatef treatment should use 
highly effective contraceptive methods. The MAH 
took the opportunity of this variation to implement 
the QRD template version 10.1 and introduce minor 
editorial changes to the labelling.

SSc-ILD received a single dose of a combination of 30 µg 
and PL 
ethinylestradiol and 150 µg levonorgestrel before and after 
twice daily dosing of 150 mg nintedanib for at least 10 
days. The adjusted geometric mean ratios (90% confidence 
interval (CI)) were 117% (108% – 127%; Cmax) and 
101% (93% – 111%; AUC0–tz) for ethinylestradiol and 
101% (90% – 113%; Cmax) and 96% (91% – 102%; 
AUC0–tz) for levonorgestrel, respectively (n=15), indicating 
that co-administration of nintedanib has no relevant effect 
on the plasma exposure of ethinylestradiol and 
levonorgestrel. However the efficacy of oral hormonal 
contraceptives may be compromised by vomiting and/or 
diarrhoea or other conditions where the absorption may be 
affected. Women taking oral hormonal contraceptives 
experiencing these conditions should be advised to use an 
alternative highly effective contraceptive measure.

the frequency of pruritus in patients treated with nintedanib

small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was comparable to patients 
treated with docetaxel alone. In total 9 reports of a non-
serious pruritus event were identified in the post-marketing 
and compassionate use setting.  As it cannot be ruled out 
that there is a relationship between the use of nintedanib 
and the observed adverse drug reaction based on data 
from the more extensive use of nintedanib in the idiopathic 
pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) indication, ‘pruritus’ is added as a 
new adverse drug reaction in section 4.8 of the SmPC with

Cases of drug-induced liver injury have been observed with 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC for Ofev and 
Vargatef to amend the current warning on drug 
induced liver injury based one case of sever liver 
injury with fatal outcome reported for Ofev during 
the post-marketing phase. In addition section 4.4 of 
the Ofev SmPC is updated to include when the 
majority of the hepatic events occurred and on the 
need for hepatic transaminases and bilirubin levels to 
be measured at regular intervals during the first 3 
months of treatment. Section 4.8 of the Vargatef 
SmPC is also updated to include in the summary of 
the safety profile that the safety data is also based 
on post-marketing data. The Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. In addition, the Worksharing 
applicant (WSA) took the opportunity to update the 
contact details of the Maltese local representative 
and to make some corrections to the Bulgarian, 
Estonian, Icelandic, Latvian and Maltese translations 
for Ofev and Bulgarian, Estonian, Latvian and 
Maltese translations for Vargatef.

nintedanib treatment, including severe liver injury with 
fatal outcome. The majority of hepatic events occur within 
the first three months of treatment. Therefore, hepatic 
transaminase and bilirubin levels should be investigated 
before treatment initiation and during the first month of 
treatment with Ofev. Patients should then be monitored at 
regular intervals during the subsequent two months of 
treatment and periodically thereafter, e.g. at each patient 
visit or as clinically indicated. Elevations of liver enzymes 
(ALT, AST, ALKP, gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GGT)) and 
bilirubin were reversible upon dose reduction or 
interruption in the majority of cases.  
If transaminase (AST or ALT) elevations > 3x ULN are 
measured, dose reduction or interruption of the therapy 
with Ofev is recommended and the patient should be 
monitored closely. Once transaminases have returned to 
baseline values, treatment with Ofev may be resumed at 
the full dose (150 mg twice daily) or reintroduced at a 
reduced dose (100 mg twice daily) which subsequently may 
be increased to the full dose. If any liver test elevations are 
associated with clinical signs or symptoms of liver injury, 
e.g. jaundice, treatment with Ofev should be permanently 
discontinued. Alternative causes of the liver enzyme 
elevations should be investigated.

‘weight decreased’ as a new adverse drug reaction 
based on a safety review of clinical trials and post-
marketing data. The Package Leaflet is updated 
accordingly. In addition, the Marketing authorisation 
holder (MAH) took the opportunity to implement a 
minor correction in the English product information, 
on drug liver injury (DILI) and on the exposure safety 
relationship between nintedanib plasma exposure and liver 
enzyme elevations, the new adverse drug reaction ‘DILI’ 
was included in section 4.8 of the SmPC with an 
‘uncommon’ frequency. Administration of nintedanib was 
associated with an elevation of liver enzymes (ALT, AST, 
ALKP, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT)), bilirubin and 
drug-induced liver injury. These increases were generally 
reversible upon dose reduction or interruption in the 
majority of cases. Patients with low body weight (< 65 kg), 
female and Asian patients have a higher risk of elevations 
in liver enzymes. Nintedanib exposure increased linearly 
with patient age, which may also result in a higher risk of 
developing liver enzyme elevations. Close monitoring is 
recommended in patients with these risk factors. The 
population mean exposure to nintedanib was 33 - 50% 
higher in Chinese, Taiwanese, and Indian patients and 16% 
higher in Japanese patients while it was 16 - 22% lower in 
Koreans compared to Caucasians (body weight corrected). 
Data from Black individuals were very limited but in the 
same range as for Caucasians.

an open label, dose escalation phase I study to 
evaluate the safety and tolerability of continuous 
twice-daily oral treatment of nintedanib in Japanese 
patients with hepatocellular carcinoma. This 
submission fulfils MEA 003. The RMP has been 
amended accordingly. In addition the MAH took the 
opportunity to update the RMP with the required 
updates requested as part of EMEA/H/C/WS0766.

increased exposure, the risk for adverse events may be 
increased in patients with mild hepatic impairment (Child 
Pugh A; see sections 4.2 and 5.2). Limited safety data are 
available in 9 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma and 
moderate hepatic impairment classified as Child Pugh B. 
Although no unexpected safety findings were reported in 
these patients, the data are insufficient to support a 
recommendation for treatment of patients with moderate 
hepatic impairment. The efficacy of nintedanib has not 
been investigated in patients with moderate hepatic 
impairment (Child Pugh B). These findings are reflected 
under section 4.4 of the SmPC. Section 4.2 is also amended 
to reflect that limited safety data available from 9 patients 
with moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh B) are 
insufficient to characterize this population.  The RMP has 
been amended accordingly to reflect the information.

Based on increased exposure, the risk for adverse events 
may be increased in patients with mild hepatic impairment 
(Child Pugh A). However, no adjustment of the starting 
dose is needed for patients with mild hepatic impairment 
based on clinical data (Child Pugh A).  
The safety and efficacy of nintedanib have not been 
investigated in patients with hepatic impairment classified 
as Child Pugh B and C. Treatment of patients with 
moderate (Child Pugh B) and severe (Child Pugh C) hepatic 
impairment with Vargatef is not recommended.

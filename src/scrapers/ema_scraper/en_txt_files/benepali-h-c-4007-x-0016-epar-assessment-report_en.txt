About the product 
Benepali is a biological medicinal product similar to the reference product, Enbrel. Benepali was authorised in the 
European Union in January 2016. The active substance of Benepali is etanercept, an immunosuppressant (ATC 
code: L04AB01). 
Etanercept is a recombinant human tumour necrosis factor receptor p75Fc fusion protein. It interferes with the 
soluble TNF-α by mimicking the inhibitory effects of naturally occurring soluble TNF receptors that deactivate 
TNF-α and therefore down-regulate immune responses. Etanercept acts as a decoy receptor for TNF-α, reducing 
TNF-α affects and hence represents a competitive TNF-α inhibitor (EPAR Enbrel, 2014; Goffe and Cather, 2003). 
Etanercept may also modulate biological responses controlled by molecules further down the inflammatory 
cascade (e.g., cytokines, adhesion molecules, proteinases etc.) that are induced or regulated by TNF-α.  
The already authorised dosage form is presented in a single-use pre-filled syringe (PFS) and pre-filled pen (PFP) 
containing 50 mg of etanercept per mL to be administered via subcutaneous (SC) injection.  
The MAH claims the same therapeutic indications for the proposed biosimilar Benepali 25 mg as granted for 
Enbrel 25 mg in the EU. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The legal basis for this extension application is a similar biological application under Article 10(4) of Directive 
2001/83/EC as amended. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/153085/2017

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Benepali has been developed as a similar biological medicinal product (biosimilar) to the reference medicinal 
product Enbrel having the tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) inhibitor etanercept as active substance. The 
purpose of this line-extension application is to introduce an additional strength of 25 mg solution for injection in 
pre-filled syringe to the existing Marketing Authorization of 50 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe 
(PFS). Benepali 50 mg is additionally available in a pre-filled pen presentation (PFP).  
The composition and presentation of Benepali 25 mg and Benepali 50 mg pre-filled syringes are identical with 
the exception of filling volume. Benepali 25 mg is presented in single-use pre-filled syringes containing 25 mg 
etanercept per 0.5 mL. The target fill volume for Benepali 25 mg is 0. 51 mL and it was selected since this is the 
target fill volume applied for the reference product Enbrel. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Benepali (etanercept) is a homodimer of a chimeric protein, produced by recombinant DNA technology in 
Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, which consists of 934 amino acids, 467 amino acids for each chain. The 
homodimer has a molecular weight of approximately 130 kDa. Each etanercept single chain contains a total of 
22 Cystein (Cys) residues. These Cys residues are linked by multiple intra-chain and inter-chain disulphide 
bonds. Etanercept is a highly glycosylated fusion protein with each monomer containing 3 N-linked glycosylation 
sites and 13 potential O-linked glycosylation sites.  
No changes to the manufacture of the active substance are proposed with the present submission.   
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Benepali finished product (FP) is a clear to slightly opalescent, colourless or pale yellow, sterile and 
preservative-free solution for injection. It is intended for subcutaneous administration, and is presented in a 
pre-filled syringe (PFS; Benepali 25 mg and Benepali 50 mg) and a pre-filled pen (PFP; Benepali 50 mg). The PFS 
consists of a clear type I glass barrel with stainless steel needle, rubber needle cover and rubber plunger. The 
immediate container in the PFP is the same PFS, and the PFP is the PFS assembled into a pen device. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/153085/2017 
Page 10/29 
  
  
The active substance in Benepali FP is etanercept and the active substance and finished product formulations are 
identical. The excipients contained in the active substance and finished product are sucrose, sodium chloride, 
sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate, disodium hydrogen phosphate heptahydrate and water for 
injections. All excipients comply with compendial monographs.  
The excipients and formulation are similar to the reference product Enbrel®, with the exception of L-arginine 
hydrochloride and the concentrations of sodium chloride and sodium phosphate that are adjusted relative to 
Enbrel.  
Compatibility of the active substance and excipients has been studied in formulation development and 
formulation robustness studies.  Benepali FP 25 mg strength is manufactured using the similar process 
parameters for 50 mg FP, with minor modifications. The differences include the volume of pooled bulk drug 
substance (BDS), filling weight, and stopper position and the input parameters were adjusted according to the 
changes. The results from risk assessment showed that there is low risk associated with the changes in these 
parameters in terms of product quality. 
Container closure system 
The FP is presented in a 1 ml syringe with fixed needle and needle shield. This packaging is standard for PFS 
presentations. The glass complies with Ph. Eur. 3.2.1, the silicone oil lubricant with Ph. Eur. 3.1.8 and the rubber 
part of the needle shield with Ph. Eur. 3.2.9. The identification of the needle shield rubber is determined by tests 
for density, ash, UV and IR spectra. The outer rigid polypropylene shell of the needle shield is not in contact with 
the Benepali solution for injection. 
The plunger rod and the backstop on the syringe are functional parts of the container that are not in contact with 
the solution for injection. The plunger rod and backstop materials have been confirmed to comply with FDA 21 
CFR regulations for materials with alimentary contact. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The PFS manufacturing process involves thawing of the active substance, followed by sterile filtration through a 
0.22 μm filter and aseptic syringe filling, and plunger placement. Following manufacture of the bulk PFS, the 
bulk packaged PFSs are shipped to the secondary packaging site for further processing. 
There are no intermediates in the Benepali FP manufacturing process. The same principles for input and output 
definitions applied for active substance are also applied for FP process controls. For the input parameters, 
critical-, key- and non-key control parameters have been defined for each step in the process as well as the 
outputs; critical and process consistency in-process controls and in-process tests. The criticality is associated 
with impact on the defined critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the Benepali FP. The input parameters have action 
limits and operating ranges and the level of action if limits are exceeded have been defined. For the output 
parameters, most of the in-process controls/tests have action limits applied and some have established 
in-process specifications. The definitions for the limits have been described. 
Process validation 
The manufacturing process validation involves the following studies: 1) process validation of the complete 
manufacturing process from thawing of the active substance to visual inspection of the final PFSs, 2) filter 
validation, 3) aseptic fill validation, and 4) filling needle cleaning validation. 
Manufacturing process consistency was demonstrated by the manufacture of three consecutive FP batches in 
commercial scale. No new data were presented for filter validation, aseptic fill validation, and filling needle 
Assessment report

cleaning validation, as these are deemed covered by the previous validation programme for manufacture of 
Benepali 50 mg FP.  
Product specification 
The finished product specification includes test methods for identity, glycan content, biological activity, purity 
and impurities, endotoxin. Other general tests (appearance, pH, osmolality) are also included in the 
specification. The analytical procedures used for release and shelf life testing of Benepali and finished product 
have been appropriately described and validated.  
The release and shelf-life specifications specifications for Benepali finished product are summarized in the 
following table: 
The specifications of Benepali 50 mg FP and Benepali 25 mg FP are identical with the exception of extractable 
volume. No changes were made to the analytical procedures. The specifications for control of Benepali 25 mg FP 
are appropriately justified.  
The impurities present or potentially present in the FP are the same as those identified and controlled in the 
active substance. Microbial contaminants and endotoxin are tested as part of FP release testing. In addition, 
testing for particulates s carried out as part of FP release testing, and characterisation testing for sub-visible 
particles was carried out for the FP. 
Batch analysis data have been presented for the three process validation batches of Benepali 25 mg FP. The 
provided batch data comply with the release specifications. 
Stability of the product 
For 25 mg Process Validation Run (PVR) batches (00001, 00002, and 00003), 6 months data at the long-term 
and the accelerated storage conditions have been provided. For 00001 PVR batch, 3 months data (completed) 
at the stress storage condition are also available.  
Overall, it is confirmed that no critical changes were observed at long-term conditions during 6 months for 25 
mg Benepali FP PVR. There were also no significant changes over 6 months under accelerated conditions. The 
potency and impurities at the initial time point were similar; while upon stress the curves were practically 
superimposable, confirming the similar instability trends and degradation pathway at 40 ± 2ºC/75 ± 5% RH 
between 25 mg and 50 mg Benepali FP from Patheon. 
To confirm the comparable stability, data comparison between 50 mg Benepali FP and 25 mg Benepali FP under 
long-term, accelerated, and stress storage condition was conducted to assess the comparability of stability 
profile. Although there were some variations in the results of TNF-α binding assay and TNF-α neutralising assay, 
degradation patterns in the test items were comparable between 50 mg Benepali FP and 25 mg Benepali FP from 
Patheon under long-term, accelerated, and stress storage condition. Overall, the results of the comparability 
and comparative stability studies indicate 50 mg Benepali FP and 25mg Benepali FP from Patheon are 
comparable in terms of degradation profile. 
Based on the comparability assessment results, the claimed shelf-life of 30 months when stored at 2°C - 8°C for 
Benepali 25 mg FP is considered acceptable.

Comparability exercise for finished medicinal drug product 
Similarity to Enbrel® was demonstrated in the course of the initial marketing authorization application of 
Benepali (i.e. Benepali 50 mg strength). The comparability exercise is also applicable for the 25 mg strength and 
thus no new data was presented. 
Adventitious agents 
The adventitious agents safety evaluation performed in the course of the initial marketing authorization of 
Benepali and the approval of the 50 mg strength is still relevant for the 25 mg strength. No changes are 
proposed that would affect safety with respect to adventitious agents. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The composition and presentation of Benepali 25 mg and Benepali 50 mg pre-filled syringes are identical with 
the exception of filling volume. Thus, the present submission mainly concerns manufacture of the finished 
product. No updates were provided with respect to the manufacture of the active substance, adventitious agents 
safety evaluation or biosimilarity assessment. Concerning these aspects, the information previously provided for 
the 50 mg strength is still relevant for the new strength. Taken together, the provided information regarding the 
additional strength of 25 mg PFS is considered sufficient and adequate. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
This line extension application to introduce an additional strength of 25 mg PFS is approvable from the quality 
point of view. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
The current line extension application was submitted to add a new strength of 25 mg solution for injection in a 
prefilled syringe to the marketing authorization of Benepali. Accordingly, no new additional non-clinical data was 
submitted for this line extension. 
During the initial marketing authorisation application the similarity between Benepali and Enbrel was 
demonstrated on a non-clinical level. 
Therefore, further studies regarding pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, genotoxicity, reproduction toxicology 
and carcinogenicity were not submitted for this line extension application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.3.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The MAH provided a justification for not submitting any environmental risk assessment studies based on the fact 
that Benepali is a protein and therefore unlikely to pose a significant risk to the environment which is in 
accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/153085/2017 
Page 13/29 
  
  
2.3.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A set of non-clinical assays testing the properties of the biosimilar Benepali in comparison with the reference 
product Enbrel, was performed during the initial MAA. This data was generally considered in line with current 
European guidance on development of biosimilars, including the EMA “Guideline on similar biological medicinal 
products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues” 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev. 1) and “Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing 
monoclonal antibodies: non-clinical and clinical issues” (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010). 
The current line extension application to the marketing authorization for Benepali was submitted to add a new 
strength of 25 mg solution for injection in a prefilled syringe. Accordingly, no new additional non-clinical data 
were submitted for this line extension.  
2.3.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Originally submitted comparative pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetic and toxicology data demonstrated 
biosimilarity between Benepali and the reference product Enbrel. The provided non-clinical comparability 
exercise testing strategy was considered as appropriate. Relevant regulatory guidelines were taken into 
consideration. 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The current line extension concerned the introduction of a new strength of Benepali. The 25 mg strength was 
presented in single-use pre-filled syringe containing 25 mg etanercept per 0.5 mL. 
No new clinical studies were performed. Reference is made to the clinical data of the Benepali 50 mg single use 
PFS and the authorised 25 mg strength of the reference product Enbrel. 
Benepali is already authorized presented in a single-use PFS and PFP containing 50 mg etanercept per mL to be 
administered via SC injection.  
For the 25 mg strength the same indications were claimed as for the 50 mg strength. The lower dose will allow 
the option of a twice weekly administration of Benepali, which is in line with the reference product Enbrel. 
Dosing in both pediatric indications is based on body weight. As Benepali, in contrast to Enbrel, is only available 
as a 25mg/50 mg single dose, the presentation is applicable only for pediatric patients with body weight equal 
or greater than 62.5 kg. A wording has been included in the PI, in section 4.2, stating that other etanercept 
products are available for pediatric patients that require less than a full 25mg/50 mg dose. 
In accordance with the procedure applied for including the two paediatric indications juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
and paediatric plaque psoriasis (EMEA/H/C/004007/II/0019/G) recently approved for the 50 mg Benepali 
strength, the product information was updated accordingly. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/153085/2017 
Page 14/29 
  
  
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK similarity was demonstrated between 50 mg/ml Benepali (SB4) and 50 mg/ml Enbrel in the initial 
marketing authorization application (EMEA/H/C/004007). Further PK studies with the introduction of the 25 mg 
strength were not considered necessary. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The clinical evidence of similarity for Benepali was demonstrated during the initial marketing authorization 
application (EMEA/H/C/004007). Further PD studies with the introduction of the 25 mg strength were not 
considered necessary. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK and PD similarity between Benepali and the reference product Enbrel was demonstrated at the time of 
the initial MA. 
Compared to the approved strength (i.e. Benepali 50 mg), no changes were proposed to the manufacturing 
process of the new 25 mg strength with the exception of the filling volume (i.e. 1 ml and 0.5 ml, respectively). 
The composition and control of the drug product remain unchanged. 
Therefore, comparative PK data demonstrating similarity of Benepali 50 mg to Enbrel can be extrapolated to the 
lower 25 mg dose. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
No new clinical pharmacology data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
This line extension introducing a lower dose of 25 mg of Benepali PFSs containing 25 mg etanercept per 0.5 mL 
corresponds to Enbrel containing 25 mg etanercept.  
The applicant claims the same therapeutic indications for the proposed biosimilar Benepali 25 mg as granted for 
Enbrel 25 mg in the EU and also approved for the 50 mg strength of Benepali.  
The introduction of the lower strength will allow a twice weekly administration of Benepali, which is approved for 
the reference product Enbrel 25 mg.  
Therefore, no new clinical studies were performed for this line extension application. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Biosimilarity of Benepali to Enbrel was demonstrated for the approved 50 mg strength, presented as solution for 
injection in a PFS and PFP during the initial application (EMEA/H/C/004007). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/153085/2017 
Page 15/29 
  
  
Compared to the approved strength (i.e. Benepali 50 mg), no changes were proposed to the manufacturing 
process of the new 25 mg strength with exception of the filling volume (i.e. 1 ml and 0.5 ml, respectively). The 
composition of the drug product remains unchanged. 
For the applied 25 mg strength the same indiactions were claimed as for Benepali 50 mg. The introduction of the 
lower strength will allow a twice weekly administration of Benepali, which was approved for the reference 
product Enbrel 25 mg. Therefore the equivalence of a twice weekly regimen of 25 mg etanercept vs once weekly 
50 mg was not assessed per se in this procedure. 
No new clinical studies were performed. The applicant refers to the clinical data of the already authorised 
Benepali 50 mg solution for injection in PFS, which is considered acceptable.  
According to the variation recently approved by EC (EMEA/H/C/004007/II/0019/G) for the 50 mg Benepali 
strength the MAH applied for the inclusion of two new indications for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
and paediatric plaque psoriasis.  
For the treatment of adolescent patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis fulfilling the criteria stated in section 
4.1 of the SPC, a full 25 mg pre-filled syringe twice weekly for paediatric patients weighing 62.5 kg or more will 
be feasible. This is in line with the 50 mg strength and is considered acceptable. 
In line with Enbrel, the dosage recommendation regarding paediatric plaque psoriasis is 0.8 mg/kg (up to a 
maximum of 50 mg per dose) once weekly. According to these recommendations, treatment with the Benepali 
25 mg pre-filled syringe will be in fact only possible for children weighing exactly 31.25 kg, which doesn’t seem 
to be feasible.  
Nevertheless, the indication and dosage recommendation is in line with the SmPC of Enbrel 25 mg pre-filled 
syringe. As with the 50 mg strength, treatment eligibility for children weighing ≥  62.5 kg and alternative 
treatment options for paediatric patients weighing less than 62.5 kg are stated in section 4.2. Therefore the 
indication is considered acceptable. 
The extrapolation of clinical efficacy data from the already approved Benepali 50 mg strength is appropriate, as 
similar efficacy had been demonstrated. According to the EMA guideline on “Similar biological medicinal 
products containing biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues”, 
extrapolation from one disease model to other indications may be accepted based on the totality of the data i.e. 
quality, non-clinical and clinical evidence. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The extrapolation of clinical efficacy data from the already approved Benepali 50 mg strength is appropriate, as 
similar efficacy had been demonstrated. 
No new clinical efficacy data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The MAH referred to the safety information of the already approved 50 mg strength of Benepali. Extrapolation 
of data gained from the Benepali 50 mg application is considered appropriate. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/153085/2017 
Page 16/29 
  
  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
No safety aspects were identified regarding the implementation of the additional new strength of 25 mg solution 
for injection in a prefilled syringe, which could diverge from the already approved 50 mg strength. Benepali 25 
mg  claims  the  same  indications  as  already  approved  for  the  50  mg  strength,  with  the  difference  of  a  twice 
weekly  administration  regimen,  which  has  already  been  approved  for  the  reference  product,  Enbrel.  An 
extrapolation of data gained from Benepali 50 mg was therefore considered appropriate. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
No new clinical safety data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.6.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. 
The annex II related to the PSUR, refers to the EURD list which remains unchanged.

2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Benepali (etanercept) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as a new biological product.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The MAH submitted a line extension application to the marketing authorisation for Benepali (C/H/004007) to add 
a new strength of 25 mg solution for injection in a prefilled syringe. 
The legal basis for this extension application is a similar biological application under Article 10(4) of Directive 
2001/83/EC as amended.  
The already authorised dosage form is presented in a single-use PFS and PFP containing 50 mg etanercept per 
mL to be administered via SC injection.  
This line extension introducing a lower dose of 25 mg of Benepali PFSs containing 25 mg etanercept per 0.5 mL 
corresponds with Enbrel containing 25 mg etanercept.  
The applicant claims the same therapeutic indications for the proposed biosimilar Benepali 25 mg as granted for 
Enbrel 25 mg in the EU. The indications comprise the use in moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 
psoriatic arthritis, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psoriasis, non-radiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis and paediatric plaque psoriasis. These indications are also in line with the approved 50 mg 
strength of Benepali. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The introduction of the lower dose will allow a twice weekly administration of Benepali in the claimed indications. 
This administration regimen is also approved for the 25 mg strength of the reference product. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
No new clinical studies were presented by the applicant for the introduction of the 25 mg strength, presented in 
a prefilled syringe. Extrapolation to the data of the already approved 50 mg strength of Benepali demonstrating 
similarity to Enbrel is considered appropriate. 
Biosimilarity of Benepali 50 mg was demonstrated in the initial marketing authorisation application.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
Compared to the approved strength (i.e. Benepali 50 mg), no changes were proposed to the manufacturing 
process of the new 25 mg strength with exception of the filling volume (i.e. 1 ml and 0.5 ml, respectively). The 
composition and control of the drug product remain unchanged. 
Benepali is a biosimilar of Enbrel which has been approved in the course of procedure EMEA/H/C/004007/0000. 
Similarity of Benepali to Enbrel was demonstrated with regards to the primary, secondary and tertiary structure, 
glycosylation, post-translational modifications (PTMs) and biological activities. No changes questioning the 
initial similarity assessment were proposed with the present submission. 
No new additional non-clinical data were submitted for this line extension. Originally submitted comparative 
pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetic and toxicology data demonstrated biosimilarity between Benepali and the 
reference product Enbrel. The provided non-clinical comparability exercise testing strategy was considered as 
appropriate. Relevant regulatory guidelines were taken into consideration. 
No new clinical data were submitted by the applicant. The applicant refers to the clinical data of the authorized 
Benepali 50 mg single use PFS and the authorised 25 mg strength of the reference product Enbrel. The lower 
strength will allow the option of a twice weekly administration of Benepali for most indications, which is in line 
with the recommendations of the reference product Enbrel 25 mg strength. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There remain no uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
No major unfavourable effects were identified. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There remain no uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects. 
3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
From a quality perspective, no major issues or risks were identified. Similarity to the reference product is not 
questioned, as the proposed manufacturing change is related to filling volume only. Taken together, the new 
strength can be approved.  
No new clinical and non-clincal studies were presented. The applicant refers to the data gained from the clinical 
and non-clinical biosimilarity program of the 50 mg strength of Benepali where biosimilarity of Benepali to Enbrel 
had already been demonstrated. The extrapolation is considered acceptable, as the indications are the same as 
for the Benepali 50 mg strength, as well as for the 25 mg strength of Enbrel. No efficacy or safety concerns arise 
from the introduction of the additional 25 mg strength.

3.7.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Benepali is positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, the CHMP considers by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of, 
Benepali 25 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe is favourable in the following indication: 
Rheumatoid arthritis 
Benepali in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active 
rheumatoid arthritis in adults when the response to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, including 
methotrexate (unless contraindicated), has been inadequate.  
Benepali can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with 
methotrexate is inappropriate. 
Benepali is also indicated in the treatment of severe, active and progressive rheumatoid arthritis in adults not 
previously treated with methotrexate. 
Benepali, alone or in combination with methotrexate, has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of joint 
damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function. 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Treatment of polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in children and 
adolescents from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, 
methotrexate. 
Treatment of psoriatic arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an inadequate response 
to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate. 
Treatment of enthesitis-related arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an inadequate 
response to, or who have proved intolerant of, conventional therapy. 
Etanercept has not been studied in children aged less than 2 years. 
Psoriatic arthritis

Treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the response to previous 
disease-modifying antirheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate. Etanercept has been shown to improve 
physical function in patients with psoriatic arthritis, and to reduce the rate of progression of peripheral joint 
damage as measured by X-ray in patients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease. 
Axial spondyloarthritis 
Ankylosing spondylitis 
Treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an inadequate response to 
conventional therapy. 
Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
Treatment of adults with severe non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation as 
indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence, who have 
had an inadequate response to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). 
Plaque psoriasis 
Treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis who failed to respond to, or who have a 
contraindication to, or are intolerant to other systemic therapy, including ciclosporin, methotrexate or psoralen 
and ultraviolet-A light (PUVA) (see section 5.1).  
Paediatric plaque psoriasis 
Treatment of chronic severe plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from the age of 6 years who are 
inadequately controlled by, or are intolerant to, other systemic therapies or phototherapies. 
is positive.

summary of mode of action 
This  diagnostic  medicinal  product  contains  the  active  substance 
ioflupane (123I) INN, (otherwise referred to as  123I-FP-CIT or  123I-β-
CIT-FP) which is a radioiodinated cocaine analogue. 
important information 
Summary of mode of action 
about its composition (e.g. 
origin of active substance 
of biological, relevant 
adjuvants or residues for 
vaccines 
Summary of mode of action: This cocaine analogue is a ligand with 
high  affinity  to  dopamine  transporter  (DaT)  located  on  the 
presynaptic  nerve  endings  (axon  terminals)  in  the  striatum.  The 
axon  terminals  are  projections  of  the  dopamine  neurones  in  the 
substantia  nigra.  Therefore,  binding  of  ioflupane  (123I)  in  the 
striatum is claimed to reflect the number of dopaminergic neurones 
in  the  substantia  nigra.  Ioflupane  (123I)  is  a  dopamine  transporter 
imaging  agent  for  single  photon  emission  computed  tomography 
(SPECT). 
Important information about its composition: Ioflupane is 
radiolabelled by (123I).

SVII.1.1. Risks not considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the 
RMP  
Known risks that require no further characterisation and are followed up via routine pharmacovigilance 
namely through signal detection and adverse reaction reporting, and for which the risk minimisation 
messages in the product information are adhered by prescribers (e.g. actions being part of standard 
clinical practice in each EU Member state where the product is authorised). 
Risks 
Injection site pain 
Drug ineffective, Drug-drug 
interaction, biodistribution alteration 
Supportive information 
Sufficiently covered by guidance in product information 
Section 4.2 (method of administration): To minimise the 
potential for pain at the injection site during administration, a 
slow intravenous injection (not less 15 to 20 seconds) via an 
arm vein is recommended. 
Section 4.8: Frequency Uncommon. Injection site pain 
(intensive pain following administration into small veins). 
Sufficiently covered by guidance in product information 
less 
Section4.2: Image acquisition 
SPECT imaging should take place between three and six hours 
post-injection.  
Images should be acquired using a gamma camera fitted with 
a  high-resolution  collimator  and  calibrated  using  the  159 keV 
photopeak  and  a  ±  10% energy  window.  Angular  sampling 
should  preferably  be  not 
than  120 views  over 
360 degrees.  
For high resolution collimators the radius of rotation should be 
consistent and set as small as possible (typically 11-15 cm). 
Experimental studies with a striatal phantom, suggest that 
optimal images are obtained with matrix size and zoom factors 
selected to give a pixel size of 3.5-4.5 mm for those systems 
currently in use. A minimum of 500 k counts should be 
collected for optimal images. Normal images are characterised 
by two symmetrical crescent-shaped areas of equal intensity. 
Abnormal images are either asymmetric or symmetric with 
unequal intensity and/or loss of crescent. 
Section 4.5: Ioflupane binds to dopamine transporter. 
Medicines that bind to the dopamine transporter with high 
affinity may therefore interfere with Ioflupane diagnosis. These 
include amphetamine, benzatropine, bupropion, cocaine, 
mazindol, methylphenidate, phentermine and sertraline. 
Potential uptake of (123I) by the 
thyroid gland

Risks 
Supportive information 
Use in patients suffering from 
alcoholism, liver disease and epilepsy 
due to an excipient ethanol 
Risk seriousness: 
No case reports of DaTSCAN concerning adverse reactions in 
patients suffering from alcoholism, liver disease and epilepsy 
due to an excipient ethanol have been identified by the 
Innovator. 
Sufficiently covered by guidance in product information 
Section 4.4: Specific warnings 
This medicinal product contains 39.5 g/L (5% volume) ethanol 
(alcohol), up to 197 mg per dose, equivalent to 5 mL beer or 
2 mL wine. Harmful for those suffering from alcoholism. To be 
taken into account in high-risk groups such as patients with 
liver disease or epilepsy. 
Risk frequency: Not known 
Impact on the benefit/risk balance:  
The benefit / risk balance of the product remains positive in 
the indication currently registered. 
Use in pregnant and lactating women  Risk seriousness: 
Cumulatively, no case reports concerning adverse effects in 
pregnant and lactating women have been identified by the 
Innovator. 
Sufficiently covered by guidance in product information 
Section 4.3: Contraindication: Pregnancy 
Section 4.6: Animal reproductive toxicity studies have not 
been performed with this product. Radionuclide procedures 
carried out on pregnant women also involve radiation doses to 
the foetus. Administration of 185 MBq of ioflupane (123I) 
results in an absorbed dose to the uterus of 2.6 mGy. 
Breastfeeding 
It is not known whether ioflupane (123I) is excreted in human 
milk. Before administering radiopharmaceuticals to a mother 
who is breast-feeding, consideration should be given to the 
possibility of delaying the administration of radionuclide until 
the mother has ceased breastfeeding, and to what is the most 
appropriate choice of radiopharmaceuticals, bearing in mind 
the secretion of activity in breast milk. 
If administration is considered necessary, breast-feeding 
should be interrupted for 3 days and substituted by formula 
feeding. During this time, breast milk should be expressed at 
regular intervals and the expressed feeds should be discarded. 
Risk frequency: Use in pregnancy and lactating women is 
contraindicated. Therefore, the frequency is not known. 
Impact on the benefit-risk balance: 
Considering the target population and the absence of case 
reports, the risk of adverse effects in pregnant and lactating 
women is low. The benefit / risk balance of the product 
remains positive in the indication currently registered.

Risks 
Hypersensitivity 
Supportive information 
Risk seriousness: 
Cumulatively, 19 case reports concerning hypersensitivity and 
potential manifestations has been received for DaTSCAN from 
all sources (both from postmarketing experience and clinical 
trials). Four (4) of the cases were serious and 15 were non-
serious. Most frequently reported reactions were rash, 
hypersensitivity, erythema and pruritus. Information 
concerning outcome was provided in 17 of the 19 cases. In 15 
cases the patient had recovered or were recovering at the time 
of reporting, while in 2 cases the patient had not recovered at 
the time of reporting. The outcome was unknown in 2 of the 
cases. 
Sufficiently covered by guidance in product information 
Section 4.8: No serious adverse reactions related to ioflupane 
have been reported. However, Hypersensitivity reactions have 
been reported with DatScan (Innovator) with a not known 
frequency. 
From the most recently available PSUR for DaTSCAN 
(innovator) five hypersensitivity reports were collected. These 
five reactions were all non-serious. 
Section 4.2: Prior to administration appropriate resuscitation 
equipment should be available. 
Section 4.3: Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any 
of the excipients. 
Section4.4: If hypersensitivity reactions occur, the 
administration of the medicinal product must be discontinued 
immediately and, if necessary, intravenous treatment initiated. 
Resuscitative medicinal products and equipment (e.g. 
endotracheal tube and ventilator) have to be readily available. 
Risk frequency:  
The true incidence of hypersensitivity reaction in the general 
population cannot be estimated from the available data.  
The Innovator DaTSCAN has cumulatively reported 19 case 
reports (until DLP 27.07.2017) concerning hypersensitivity and 
potential manifestations. Compared with the estimated 
exposure of DaTSCAN, the number of case reports suggested 
a very low frequency. 
Impact on the benefit-risk balance: 
Hypersensitivity reactions to ioflupane (123I) have been 
reported as non-serious. The benefit of ioflupane (123I) in 
diagnostic use outweighs the risk of hypersensitivity. 
Risk seriousness: 
No case reports of DaTSCAN were identified concerning SOC 
Congenital, familial and genetic disorders or HLT Radiation 
injuries. Six cases reports were identified within SOC 
Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (including cysts 
and polyps). One serious case from post-marketing experience 
concerning thyroid cancer, provided limited information and 
does therefore not contribute with new information about 
exposure to ionising radiation. The remaining 5 serious cases

Risks 
Supportive information 
were reports from clinical trials, and all events were 
considered unrelated to the study drug, according to the 
reporting investigators. 
Ionizing radiation is linked with cancer induction and can lead 
to development of hereditary defects via radiation induces 
DNA-damage. The administration of radiopharmaceuticals 
creates risks for external radiation contamination from 
improper handling of the product and exposure to urine or 
other bodily excretions from a patient undergoing an imaging 
procedure. 
Safety measures have been implemented in sections 4.4, 4.8, 
of the SmPC in order to minimise this risk. 
Sufficiently covered by guidance in product information 
Section 4.4: For each patient, radiation exposure must be 
justifiable by the likely benefit. The activity administered 
should in every case be as low as reasonably achievable to 
obtain the required diagnostic information. 
Section 4.8: Exposure to ionising radiation is linked with 
cancer induction and a potential for development of hereditary 
defects. As the effective dose is 4.6 mSv when the maximal 
recommended activity of 185 MBq is administered these 
adverse events are expected to occur with a low probability. 
Risk frequency: Not known. 
Impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product: The 
benefit / risk balance of the product remains positive in the 
indication currently registered. 
Risks 
Supportive information 
Increased risk of radiation exposure 
in patients with hepatic or renal 
impairment 
Risk seriousness:  
No relevant case reports concerning adverse effects in patients 
with hepatic or renal impairment have been identified neither 
by the Innovator nor by CURIUM. 
An increased radiation is possible in patients with renal 
impairment because approximately 60 % of the injected 
radioactivity is excreted in the urine. 
Faecal excretion is calculated at approximately 14%. 
Section 4.2: Formal studies have not been carried out in 
patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment. No data 
are available (see section 4.4).  
Careful consideration of the activity to be administered is 
required since an increased radiation exposure is possible in 
these patients. 
Section 4.4: Renal impairment / Hepatic impairment ; 
Formal studies have not been carried out in patients with 
significant renal or hepatic impairment. In the absence of 
data, Ioflupane (123I) is not recommended in cases of 
moderate to severe renal or hepatic impairment.

Patient preparation  
The patient should be well hydrated before the start of the 
examination and urged to void as often as possible during the 
first hours after the examination in order to reduce radiation.

Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan    
Summary of risk management plan for Striascan 
(Ioflupane (123I)) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Striascan.  
Striascan summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential information 
to healthcare professionals and patients on how Striascan should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Striascan should be read in the context of all this information including 
the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Striascan’s RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Striascan is authorised for diagnostic use only.  
It  contains  ioflupane  (123I)  as  the  active  substance  and  it  is  given  by  intravenous  route  of 
administration.  It  is  used  to  help  identify  conditions  in  the  brain.  It  belongs  to  a  group  of  medicines 
called 
“radiopharmaceuticals”,  which  contain  a  small  amount  of 
radioactivity.  When  a 
radiopharmaceutical is injected, it collects in a specific organ or area of the body for a short time and 
this  small  amount  of  radioactivity  can  be  detected  from  outside  the  body  using  special  cameras.  An 
image, known as a scan, can be taken. This scan will show exactly where the radioactivity is inside the 
organ and the body. This can give the doctor valuable information about how that organ is working and 
help in  deciding on  possible treatment.  In the  case of Striascan,  collection  is observed in area of the 
brain.  Changes  in  this  area  of  the  brain  occur  in  Parkinsonism  (including  Parkinson’s  disease)  and 
dementia with Lewy bodies.  
(See SmpC for the full indication). 
Further information about the evaluation of Striascan’s benefits can be found in Striascan’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage 
Page 14/17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimise or further characterise the risks  
Important risks of Striascan, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about Striascan, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These 
measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.   
If important information that may affect the safe use of Striascan is not yet available, it is listed under 
“missing information” below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Striascan are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Striascan. Potential risks are concerns for which an association 
with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been 
established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of 
the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of 
the medicine);

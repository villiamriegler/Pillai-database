2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Rivaroxaban Mylan tablets 2.5, 10, 15 and 20 mg MAAs have been submitted according to the Article 10.1 of 
Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended (i.e. generic application) containing the same active substance in the 
same pharmaceutical form and strengths as the reference product. The reference product is Xarelto 2.5, 10, 
15 and 20 mg film-coated tablets, marketed by Bayer AG, that was first approved in the European Union on 
30/09/2008 via centralised procedure (EU/1/08/472). 
Rivaroxaban is a highly selective direct factor Xa inhibitor with oral bioavailability. Inhibition of factor Xa 
interrupts the intrinsic and extrinsic pathway of the blood coagulation cascade, inhibiting both thrombin 
formation and development of thrombi. Rivaroxaban does not inhibit thrombin (activated factor II) and no 
effects on platelets have been demonstrated. 
The indications applied for Rivaroxaban Mylan are the same as those for the reference products:  
Rivaroxaban Mylan is indicated for:

2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of rivaroxaban is 5-chloro-N-({(5S)-2-oxo-3-[4-(3-oxomorpholin-4-yl)phenyl]-1,3-
oxazolidin-5-yl}methyl)thiophene-2-carboxamide or 5-chloro-N-({(5S)-2-oxo-3-[4-(3-oxo-4-
morpholinyl)phenyl]-1,3-oxazolidin-5-yl}methyl)-2-thiophenecarboxamide corresponding to the molecular 
formula C19H18ClN3O5S. It has a molecular weight of 435.88 and the following structure: 
Figure 1: Active substance structure 
The chemical structure of active substance was elucidated by a combination of elemental analysis, IR, UV, 1H 
NMR, 13C NMR, Mass spectroscopy, and PXRD.  
The active substance is a white or yellowish non-hygroscopic powder practically insoluble in water, freely 
soluble in dimethyl sulfoxide, practically insoluble in anhydrous ethanol and in heptane.  
Rivaroxaban has one chiral centre. It exhibits two structural isomers R and S. The commercial active 
substance has S absolute configuration. R isomer is formed by regioselective synthetic reaction and it is 
controlled in the active substance specification. 
Rivaroxaban exhibits polymorphism and different forms i.e., Modification-I, Modification-II, Modification-III, 
Hydrate and NMP solvate are reported in the literature. The drug substance manufacturer consistently 
produces single polymorphic form of Rivaroxaban.

the EU guideline on chemistry of active substances. Potential and actual impurities were extensively 
discussed with regard to their origin and characterised. Carry-over of the starting materials themselves to 
rivaroxaban has been adequately studied. The discussion and control of possible degradation impurities of 
rivaroxaban were provided and considered satisfactory. Data on the active substance genotoxic impurities 
was presented and considered satisfactory.  
No changes to the manufacturing processes have been described in the manufacturing process development 
section. 
The active substance manufactured by the manufacturer-1 is packaged in LDPE bag twist and tied. Further it 
is inserted in HMLDPE bag and heat sealed. Both these bags are then put into the outer bag of triple 
laminated aluminium bag and heat sealed. These polybags are further packed in HDPE drums, closed with 
plastic lids having rubber gasket followed by locking ring, seal and labelled. All the materials comply with the 
EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
The active substance manufactured by the manufacturer-2  is packaged in transparent under nitrogen 
purging. The transparent bag is placed in a black LDPE bag. This pack is finally put in a HPDPE drum. All the 
materials comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification used by the manufacturer of the finished product shown in Table 1 includes 
tests for appearance (visual), solubility (Ph. Eur.), identification (IR, HPLC), water content (KF), sulfated ash 
(Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), enantiomeric purity (HPLC), residual solvents (GC-MS), 
formic acid (HPLC), particle size (Malvern), melting point (Ph. Eur.), specific optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), 
microbial test (Ph. Eur.) and identification (PXRD). 
The specifications are in accordance with the Ph. Eur. monograph on rivaroxaban, supplemented with more 
tests on PXRD, residual solvents, melting point, specific optical rotation and formic acid. During the procedure 
the tests for microbial quality and PSD were added and the limit for total impurities was tightened to NMT 
0.30%, according to Ph. Eur. Monograph.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented.

Stability 
Stability data from several commercial scale batches of active substance manufactured by manufacturer-1 
stored in the intended commercial package for up to 18 months under long term conditions (25±2°C/60±5% 
RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40±2°C/75±5% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. 
Stability data from several commercial scale batches of active substance manufactured by manufacturer-
2stored in the intended commercial package for up to 24 months under long term conditions 
(25±2°C/60±5% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40±2°C/75±5% RH) according to 
the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The following parameters were tested: description, identification, loss on drying, water content, related 
substances, enantiomeric purity (specific optical rotation) and assay. The analytical methods used were the 
same as for release and were stability indicating. All results were found within the proposed limits and no 
significant changes were observed in the active substance manufactured by both manufacturers. 
Stress studies (acid hydrolysis, base, hydrolysis, oxidation, and heat degradation, thermal (105°C -24 Hrs) 
and after 24 hrs exposure at 90 ±5% RH)) have been performed and changes in assay and related 
compounds have been found and evaluated. The methods for assay, enantiomeric purity and related 
compounds have been demonstrated to be stability indicating.  
Photostability study of one batch of rivaroxaban according to ICH Q1B guideline was performed and showed 
that the active substance is photostable. Additionally, the active substance manufacturers have demonstrated 
that the IR, XRD and chiral purity of the active substance remain unchanged during the stability period.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months without special storage conditions 
for the active substance manufactured by manufacturer-1 in the proposed container and 36 months without 
special storage conditions for the active substance manufactured by manufacturer-2 in the proposed 
container. 
The finished product manufacturer, irrespective of the actual retest period approved for each active 
substance manufacturer (24 or 36 months), applies a more restrictive retest period without special storage 
conditions. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as film coated biconvex, bevelled edge tablet, debossed with RX on onside 
of the tablet and 1 (2.5 mg), 2 (10 mg), 3 (15 mg) and 4 (20 mg) on other side. 
Each tablet shape is round (2.5 mg tablets (approximately 5.4 mm), 10 mg (approximately 5.4 mm), 15 mg 
(approximately 6.4 mm), 20 mg (approximately 7.0 mm)). Strengths are also differentiated by colour (2.5 
mg: light yellow to yellow, 10 mg: pink to brick red, 15 mg: pink to brick red and 20 mg: light pink to pink). 
Since the 10 mg and 15 mg strengths are differentiated only by the debossing and size, whilst shape (round) 
and colour (pink to brick red) are the same, to further reduce medication errors, the CHMP recommends to 
investigate any additional differentiation (colour and/or shape) in the future.

The purpose of the pharmaceutical development studies outlined below was to develop an essentially similar 
generic version of the reference medicinal product Xarelto film coated tablets, suitable for production scale 
batches (large-scale manufacture), exhibit reproducible results and demonstrate acceptable stability 
performance in the proposed marketing pack(s). 
Based on the active substance properties and characterisation of reference product and its label, a quality 
target product profile (QTPP) that includes dissolution, uniformity of dosage units, related substance and 
other aspects of product quality and equivalence were identifiedThe active substance was analysed for 
particle size distribution, bulk density, tapped density, compressibility index, Hausner ratio, and solubility. 
Regarding solubility, relevant data indicate that rivaroxaban is practically insoluble across different pH range; 
however solubility increases with the addition of a surfactant. 
To evaluate compatibility of selected excipients with the active substance, binary mixtures of the active 
substance and excipients were prepared with different ratios and exposed for  defined period at 40°C ±2°C / 
75 ± 5% RH in glass vials closed with rubber stopper with aluminum cap seal. The samples were evaluated 
for physical characteristics, assay and related substance at initial and after exposure. The results of the 
excipients compatibility studies indicate that there was no significant change in the physical appearance of 
the binary mixtures. 
All of the excipients used are conventional pharmaceutical ingredients that comply with the requirements of 
the Ph. Eur. except coating materials. The coating materials are proprietary materials purchased from a 
qualified commercial supplier, to an agreed specification. The individual compendial components used in the 
manufacturing of coating materials comply with the monograph in Ph. Eur. / NF. There are no novel 
excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the 
SmPC. 
Based on identified QTPP, the formulation development was initiated for the finished product. The product 
development involved identifying a feasible prototype formulation followed by optimisation studies for all the 
relevant formulation and process parameters. 
The optimisation studies were carried out for prototype formulation composition and manufacturing process; 
they consist optimisation of: diluent concentration, binder concentration, wetting agent, lubricant 
concentration, disintegrating agent concentration, coating build up and  active substance particle size. 
The speed of the paddle apparatus, the buffer choice and surfactant concentration have been adequately 
justified for all strengths as they are needed to maintain sink conditions and the adequate buffer capacity. 
The discriminatory nature of dissolution method was evaluated with changes in both composition and process 
parameters. The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. 
Various comparisons of dissolution profiles have been elaborated: dissolution profiles of the generic medicinal 
product Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 20 mg film-coated tablets (manufactured by Mylan) and the 
reference medicinal product Xarelto film-coated tablets  were generated in different dissolution media. In all 
the cases the dissolution profiles can be considered as similar.  
A bioequivalence study between Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg film-coated tablets (manufactured 
by Mylan and the reference medicinal product Xarelto 2.5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg film-coated tablets 
(Manufactured by Bayer AG) has been performed. The composition and manufacturing process of the test 
product used in the bioequivalence study is identical to the one proposed for commercial supplies. 
Bioequivalence is confirmed.

A biowaiver for Rivaroxaban 15 mg film-coated tablets was requested. Since the 15 mg strength fulfils all the 
requirements to waive the bioequivalence studies for additional strengths as mentioned in CPMP guideline on 
the Investigation of Bio-equivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98- Rev 01 – January 2010, the bio-equivalence 
study results of Rivaroxaban 20 mg film-coated tablets can be extended to Rivaroxaban 15 mg film-coated 
tablets. The active substance has poor flow properties and low solubility. To improve the flowability of and 
dissolution of the active substance, wet granulation by rapid mixing was selected for the manufacturing of the 
finished product. The additional steps of the manufacturing process consist of: milling and sifting of the 
granules followed by lubrication, compression, and film coating. 
According to the SmPC, tablets may be crushed and administered in a small amount of water via a gastric 
tube or may be crushed and mixed with apple puree immediately prior to use and administered orally. 
Relevant studies in order to demonstrate similarity between the test and the reference product after 
administration via a gastric tube have been provided during the procedure and considered satisfactory. 
Relevant compatibility and stability studies have been provided by the applicant and considered satisfactory. 
The primary packaging is PVC/PVdC/Aluminum foil blister packs or perforated unit dose blisters and white HDPE 
bottles with white opaque PP screw cap with aluminum induction sealing liner wad. The material complies with 
Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data 
and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The finished product is manufactured by one manufacturing site.  
The manufacturing process consists of 11 main steps 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality 
in a reproducible manner. The typical production scale batch size(s) proposed for each strength have been 
validated according to the proposed process validation protocol. Alternate batch sizes between submission 
and proposed production-scale batch sizes, will be fully validated before marketing. The process validation 
scheme is well accepted. 
The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process.  
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: description 
(visual),  dimensions,  identification  (HPLC,  UV),  dissolution  (HPLC),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (by  content 
uniformity),  assay  (HPLC),  related  substance  (HPLC),  water  (KF),  microbial  test  (Ph.  Eur),  and  color 
identification (chemical methods). 
The release specification for the  strengths is the same as the one for the 2.5 mg tablet with the exception of 
the description, dimension, colour identification and content the nominal assay.  
The proposed specification tests are in line with guideline and Ph. Eur. requirements and suitable for an 
immediate release tablet. The specification limits have been fully justified. During the procedure, the limit for 
the dissolution test has been tightened.

The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on several batches 
using a validated ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not 
detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment and the presented batch data it 
can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls.  
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed (as requested) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and 
answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine 
impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional control measures 
are deemed necessary. The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for several commercial scale batches per strength confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from several commercial scale  batches per strength of finished product with the active 
substance manufactured by manufacturer-1 and manufacturer-2 stored under long term conditions (25°C / 
60% RH) and under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The batches with active substance from manufacturer-1, have completed the stability study up to 6 months 
at accelerated condition and 12 months at long term condition and batches, with active substance from 
manufacturer-2, have completed the stability study up to 6 months at accelerated condition and 9 months at 
long term. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed 
in the primary packaging proposed for marketing, i.e., PVC/PVdC blister pack and HDPE bottle pack.  
Samples were tested for description, water, related substance, dissolution, assay, and microbiological testing. 
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. No significant changes have been observed and all 
parameters were within the specifications. 
In-use stability studies were performed in the HDPE bottle The results were found to comply with finished 
product shelf life specification at the tested phases for all the test parameters. Based on results, an in-use 
shelf life of 180 days is agreed for this product. 
An ‘open pot’ stability study was performed to examine the effect on product when continuously exposed to 
the environment (by loading the sample into open containers i.e., petri dish and exposed over a period of time 
at 25 ± 2°C / 60 ± 5% RH). The results of open pot stability study were found to comply with the finished 
product shelf life specifications for the test parameters studied. Hence, the product is found to be stable up to 
a period of 90 days at the studied open pot stability conditions.

In addition, film-coated tablets strength packed in i.e. PVC/PVdC blister and HDPE bottle pack was exposed to 
light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products The 
study results indicated that there were no out of specification results observed for all test parameters; thus, 
it can be concluded that the finished product is not photosensitive. 
Forced degradation / stress studies were performed during validation of the assay and related substances 
test methods. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years and without storage conditions when 
stored in either of the primary packaging proposed for marketing as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are 
acceptable. In use shelf-life for the bottle once open 180 days. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and/or finished product 
and their manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process of 
the active substance, nor for the finished product. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there was a minor unresolved quality issues having no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertain to investigate any additional differentiation (colour and/or 
shape) in the tablets in the future to further reduce medication errors  since the 10 mg and 15 mg strengths 
are differentiated only by the debossing and size, whilst shape (round) and colour (pink to brick red) are the 
same. This point is being put forward and agreed as a recommendation for future quality development. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
- To investigate any additional differentiation (colour and/or shape) in the future to further reduce medication 
errors since the 10 mg and 15 mg strengths are differentiated only by the debossing and size, whilst shape 
(round) and colour (pink to brick red) are the same.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to 
generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical 
aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been 
discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment studies were submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Rivaroxaban Mylan manufactured by Mylan Ireland Limited is considered unlikely to result in 
any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all rivaroxaban containing products and the 
exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar.  
However, from the data submitted and the trend for an overall increase in the sales of rivaroxaban containing 
products the CHMP recommended that the applicant should conduct an ERA in accordance with 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr.2.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical overview is based on published literature data. This is acceptable since rivaroxaban is a well-
known active substance and essential similarity is claimed to the reference product. There are no new non-
clinical studies performed in support of the proposed application hence the presented Non-clinical Overview is 
considered sufficient for this type of MAA. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no objections to approval of Rivaroxaban Mylan from a non-clinical point of view.  
The CHMP recommended an ERA in accordance with EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr.2. should be conducted 
by the applicant. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for film-coated tablets containing rivaroxaban. To support the marketing authorisation 
application the applicant conducted 3 bioequivalence studies with cross-over design under fasting or fed 
conditions. These studies were pivotal for the assessment. 
No formal scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product.

1/ Corr** (20 January 2010) as well as the Guideline on Bioanalytical method validation 
EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09, Rev.1 Corr. 2** (21 July 2011). 
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as 
efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the SmPC of the 
reference product. 
GCP aspect 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Exemption 
The Applicant requested a biowaiver for the 15 mg film-coated tablets, suggesting that the bioequivalence 
study results of 20 mg strength can be extended to 15 mg film-coated tablets, according to CPMP guideline 
on the Investigation of Bio-equivalence - CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1/ Corr **, since the following holds: 
1/ Both strengths of Rivaroxaban i.e. 15 mg and 20 mg film coated tablets, are manufactured by the same 
manufacturer at the same manufacturing site using same manufacturing process. 
2/ The qualitative composition of both strengths is the same. 
3/ The composition of the strengths is quantitatively proportional, i.e. the ratio between the amount of each 
excipient to the amount of active substance is same for both strengths. 
4/ The dissolution profiles of 15 mg and 20 mg strengths are similar in three different pHs. 
5/ The absorption kinetics of Rivaroxaban is linear within the therapeutic dose range. 
6/ As per posology and method of administration, both 15 mg and 20 mg strengths are recommended to be 
taken with food. 
The rationale for a biowaiver for the 15 mg strength was accepted. 
Tabular overview of clinical studies  
To support the application, the applicant has submitted 3 bioequivalence studies:

2.4.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Study RIRO-TFZ-1001: Single-dose, randomized, balanced, two-treatment, two-period, crossover oral BE 
study in healthy adult human subjects under fasting conditions, investigating the bioequivalence of Mylan’s 
rivaroxaban 2.5 mg film-coated tablets to Xarelto 2.5 mg film-coated tablets of Bayer AG. 
Methods 
•  Study design  
RIRO-TFZ-1001 study was a single-dose, randomized, balanced, two-treatment, two-period, crossover oral 
BE study in healthy adult human subjects under fasting conditions, investigating the bioequivalence of 
Mylan’s rivaroxaban 2.5 mg film-coated tablets to Xarelto 2.5 mg film-coated tablets of Bayer AG. 
In each study period, subjects received a single oral dose of 2.5 mg of a rivaroxaban tablet (test or 
reference) after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours. The tablet was swallowed whole without chewing or 
crushing. A washout period of 3 days was maintained between the successive dosing days. 
Access to the randomization code was restricted to the pharmacist or delegated staff during clinical conduct, 
and was provided by the QA department to the medical writers for report writing purposes.  
•  Test and reference products  
Rivaroxaban Mylan 2.5 mg film-coated tablets manufactured by Mylan has been compared to Xarelto 2.5 mg 
fil-coated tablets manufactured by Bayer AG, Leverkusen, Germany.

•  Population(s) studied 
This study was designed based on the known pharmacokinetics of Rivoraxaban and generally accepted 
standards for the conduct of bioequivalence studies. 
As per protocol, 60 subjects were enrolled in the study (30 + 2 additional subjects in group-I and 30 + 2 
additional subjects in group-II) who complied with all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria  
Two subjects withdrew consent before the second period of the study for personal reasons, and therefore 58 
subjects completed clinical portion of the study.  
Four protocol deviations occurred. The reported deviations from protocol have no impact on the outcome of 
the BE study. 
•  Analytical methods 
The plasma samples of subjects were analysed using a validated LC-MS/MS method for rivaroxaban, over a 
concentration range of 1.001 ng/mL (Lower limit of quantitation - LLOQ) to 100.099 ng/mL (Upper limit of 
quantitation - ULOQ), to determine the concentrations of Rivaroxaban in the samples of all analysed subjects.  
A detailed description of the operative procedures and the validation process were provided. 
•  Pharmacokinetic variables 
Employing the estimated concentration vs. time profiles of rivaroxaban, the following pharmacokinetic 
parameters were calculated: 
- 
- 
Primary PK Parameters: Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ 
Secondary PK Parameters: Tmax, Kel and T1/2 
•  Statistical methods 
Descriptive statistics of all the pharmacokinetic parameters were computed and reported for Rivoraxaban. 
The summary statistics (for relevant pharmacokinetic parameters) were computed and reported for both test 
and reference products of Rivaroxaban. 
The ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC0-t of Rivaroxaban were subjected to Analysis 
of Variance (ANOVA). 
Criteria for conclusion of bioequivalence: 
The 90% confidence intervals for the difference of means of ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters 
Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ for rivaroxaban had to fall within the acceptance range of 80.00 to 125.00% to 
conclude the test product was bioequivalent to the reference product under fasting conditions.

•  Safety data 
Two AEs were reported by two subjects over the course of the study. 
The two reported adverse events (Alanine aminotransferase increased) were mild in severity and possibly 
related to the study drug. They occurred during post study safety evaluation and cannot be definitively 
attributed to either of the treatments since testing was performed only at screening and study exit. 
Increased alanine aminotransferase is a known adverse event for rivaroxaban, as in paragraph 4.8 of the 
originator and proposed PI increase in transaminases is characterised as common. 
Overall, Rivaroxaban Mylan Tablets 2.5 mg and Xarelto 2.5 mg rivaroxaban film-coated tablets were well 
tolerated by subjects under fasting conditions.

2.4.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. The 
pharmacodynamics properties of the molecule are well known from the reference compound. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The Applicant has submitted three BE studies i.e. study RIRO-TFZ-1001 with 2.5 mg film-coated tablets in 
fasted state, study RIRO-1-19112 with 10 mg film-coated tablets in fasted state and study RIRO-1-19113 
with 20 mg film-coated tablets in fed state. The BE study on the 20 mg strength was used to support a 
biowaiver for the 15 mg strength. The BE studies for the 2.5 mg and 10 mg tablets in fasted state and the 20 
mg tablets in fed state were performed following the EMA guidance “Rivaroxaban film-coated tablets 2.5, 10, 
15 and 20 mg product-specific bioequivalence guidance” (EMA/CHMP/160650/2016, 1 April 2016). According 
to it “since there is a different food effect resulting in different food recommendations for the lower (2.5 and 
10 mg) and the higher (15 and 20 mg) strengths, fasting study should be conducted for the lower strengths, 
and fed study for the higher strengths”. 
The study population, PK variables, statistical methods as well as the acceptance ranges for bioequivalence 
used in the three BE studies are in accordance with the bioequivalence guideline (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 
Rev.1 Cor**). The pre-set bioequivalence criteria were met for all three studies.  
The analytical method used for the rivaroxaban concentration in plasma determination for all BE studies 
seems to be adequately presented and to follow the requirements of the “Guideline on Bioanalytical method 
validation” (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/09). The Applicant has performed the standard validations for the 
analytical method. 
The in vivo BE study for the strengths of 15 mg can be waived, as all biowaiver of strength criteria are fulfilled. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Based on the three BE studies, it can be concluded that the Rivaroxaban Mylan 2.5 mg, 10 mg and 20 mg 
film-coated tablets are bioequivalent to the Xarelto 2.5 m, 10 mg and 20 mg film-coated tablets. 
Since all the criteria for the biowaiver of strength for the Rivaroxaban Mylan 15 mg film-coated tablets are 
fulfilled, it can be concluded that the Rivaroxaban Mylan 15 mg film-coated tablets are bioequivalent to the 
Xarelto 15 mg film-coated tablets. 
No safety issues have been identified during the BE studies.

2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has 
been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
A QRD form for assessment of user testing bridging proposals [EMA/355722/2014] has been submitted. The 
Applicant successfully justified the grounds for bridging design/layout/format and content with those of the 
Parent PLs (Duloxetine Mylan and Xarelto, respectively) that have been approved after user testing. This 
approach is acceptable and no further user testing is required. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This application concerns a generic version of rivaroxaban film-coated tablets. The reference product Xarelto 
is indicated for:  
•  Rivaroxaban Mylan 2.5 mg 
Rivaroxaban Mylan, co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) alone or with ASA plus clopidogrel 
or ticlopidine, is indicated for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients after an 
acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with elevated cardiac biomarkers (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1).

No non-clinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
non-clinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical 
aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
The bioequivalence studies form the pivotal basis with a two-period, two-treatment cross-over bioequivalence

study in healthy, adult subjects under fasting or fed conditions design. The study design was considered 
adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with the respective European 
requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were 
adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were 
adequate. 
The test formulation of Rivaroxaban Mylan met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when 
compared with the Xarelto. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-
t, AUC0-72h, and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of [range, e.g. 80.00 to 
125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.

Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Sirturo 
bedaquiline 
On 12 December 2019, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
SIRTURO. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Janssen-Cilag International NV. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to the existing indication as follows:2 
“SIRTURO is indicated for use as part of an appropriate combination regimen for pulmonary 
multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in adults and adolescent patients (12 years to less 
than 18 years of age and weighing at least 30 kg) when an effective treatment regimen 
cannot otherwise be composed for reasons of resistance or tolerability (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 
5.1). 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.” 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report (EPAR), 
and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to the marketing 
authorisation has been granted by the European Commission. 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 67 days 
from adoption of the opinion

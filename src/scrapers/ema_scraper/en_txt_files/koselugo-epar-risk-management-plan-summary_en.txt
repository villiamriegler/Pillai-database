SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR KOSELUGO® 
(SELUMETINIB) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for selumetinib. The RMP details 
important risks of selumetinib, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about selumetinib's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Selumetinib's SmPC for EU RMP and its package leaflet give essential information to 
healthcare professionals and patients on how selumetinib should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for selumetinib should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
selumetinib's RMP. 
VI.1 
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
Selumetinib is indicated for the treatment of symptomatic, inoperable plexiform 
neurofibromas (PN) in paediatric patients with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) aged 3 years 
and above (see SmPC for the full indication) . It contains selumetinib sulfate as the active 
substance and it is given orally (capsule formulation of the hydrogen sulfate salt [selumetinib 
hydrogen sulfate Hyd-Sulfate] presented in 10 mg and 25 mg strengths). 
Further information about the evaluation of selumetinib’s benefits can be found in 
selumetinib’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, 
under the medicine’s webpage

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND 
ACTIVITIES TO MINIMISE OR FURTHER CHARACTERISE 
THE RISKS 
Important risks of selumetinib, together with measures to minimise such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about selumetinib's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals. 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging. 
 
 1 (7) 
 
 
 
  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly. 
  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of selumetinib is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
VI.2.1 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of selumetinib are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of selumetinib. Potential risks are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available 
data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing 
information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently 
missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term use of the medicine).

SmPC for selumetinib. 
In paediatric patients with NF1, no specific risk factors have been identified to 
predict which patients might develop LVEF reductions. It could be anticipated 
that patients with pre-existing impaired left ventricular function may be at 
greater risk of developing LVEF reductions.

Risk factors and risk groups 
Physeal dysplasia 
Mechanistically there is a plausible rationale for anticipating an effect on 
bone, and physeal hypertrophy is described pre clinically for the MEK 
inhibitor trametinib. Preclinical evidence of physeal dysplasia following 
selumetinib administration has been identified in the rat (however, not in the 
mouse or monkey). 
Physeal dysplasia can occur whilst the growth plate remains open and this 
reflects the period of risk for paediatric patients. In humans the growth plate is 
open from birth and closure occurs at or prior to adulthood. Limb shortening 
(dwarfism) and joint pain are common clinical manifestations associated with 
physeal dysplasia.

development plan. 
Ocular toxicity 
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine 
Ocular toxicity is a class effect for MEK inhibitors. Although blurred vision 
has been reported as a common event and is considered an ADR for 
selumetinib in the paediatric population, no serious ocular toxicities such as 
 3 (7) 
 
 
 
 
Table VI-3 
Important potential risks 
retinal vein occlusion, central serous retinopathy and retinal pigment epithelial 
detachment were reported for any patient in SPRINT. However, a single event 
of RPED was reported in a paediatric patient receiving selumetinib 
monotherapy for pilocytic astrocytoma involving the optic pathway in an 
externally sponsored paediatric study. In adult patients with advanced cancer, 
few isolated episodes of ocular toxicity were reported (RVO in 1 patient; 
chorioretinopathy and RPED in 2 patients each) and for this reason, ocular 
toxicity is considered to be an important potential risk for the paediatric NF1 
population. 
Risk factors and risk groups  No case reports of serious ocular toxicities such as retinal vein occlusion, 
central serous retinopathy and retinal pigment epithelial detachment have been 
identified in paediatric patients given selumetinib in the SPRINT studies and 
therefore risk factors have not been identified. Patients were excluded from 
taking part in the SPRINT studies if they had a range of ophthalmologic 
conditions that could predispose to ocular toxicities and so it cannot be 
confirmed if clinically predisposing factors for  ocular toxicities result in an 
increased risk for developing RVO, RPED or chorioretinopathy on treatment 
with selumetinib. 
In a retrospective analysis of patients who experienced RVO in a Phase I study 
with an investigational MEK inhibitor, it was noted that predisposing factors 
for retinopathy (hypertension, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia and glaucoma) 
were noted in all patients with RVO; however, these predisposing factors were 
not confirmed prospectively (Lo Russo 2010). 
In accordance to the Royal College of Ophthalmologists RVO guidelines 
2015, conditions that cause systemic inflammation or hyperviscosity increase 
the risk of VTE and can rarely which can, rarely, be associated with a retinal 
vein occlusion.

development plan. 
Myopathy 
CPK increased is listed as a common event in Section 4.8 of selumetinib 
SmPC; however, in the paediatric pool, there was no evidence of muscular 
AEs such as myalgia or muscular weakness in association with 
selumetinib-induced CPK increase, with the exception of a small number of 
reports where other more plausible etiologies were identified. Furthermore, no 
events of hypocalcaemia were associated with events suggestive of muscle 
injury. 
Elevation of CPK, which may accompany and/or herald the onset of myopathy 
(including the serious outcome of rhabdomyolysis), is a very common event 
for MEK inhibitors and is considered a class effect although it is usually not

Important potential risks 
Risk factors and risk groups 
associated with any symptoms or clinical consequences. Dropped head 
syndrome is a rare but distinctive myopathy that has been described with MEK 
inhibition and is fully reversible with discontinuation of the MEK inhibitor 
(Chen et al 2012). Rhabdomyolysis is listed as an uncommon ADR for 
trametinib monotherapy in the SmPC. 
Since no cases of myopathy that appear drug-related have been reported in the 
paediatric population it is not possible to identify potential risk factors for this 
occurrence on selumetinib. For drug-induced myopathy in general, many 
publications report on risk factors for statin induced myopathy which included 
genetic factors as well as advanced age, small body mass index, female 
gender, metabolic co-morbidities, and vigorous physical exercise. Age is a 
particularly strong contributor; however, it is unknown if these risk factors 
apply to MEK inhibitors and paediatric patients (Feng 2012).

See Section VI.2.3 of this summary for an overview of the post-authorisation 
development plan. 
Hepatotoxicity 
Elevations of ALT and AST have been reported in paediatric patients and are 
included with a frequency of very common in Section 4.8 of the selumetinib 
SmPC. Transaminase elevations are also very commonly reported events for 
approved MEK inhibitors. Since the mechanism is poorly understood, it 
cannot be ruled out that elevated transaminases may be a prelude to more 
serious hepatoxicity such as liver injury. 
Since no reports of serious hepatotoxicity such as liver injury (predictable or 
idiosyncratic) have been received for selumetinib in the paediatric population 
it’s not possible to state what risk factors or risk groups can be identified. 
However, it is common for paediatric patients with NF1 to be administered 
medications such paracetamol or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs) for management of tumour pain that could place them at a higher 
propensity to develop hepatic events. In the literature, there are a number of 
risk factors for developing drug induced liver injury (DILI) that have been 
reported for other drugs including older age, female gender, comorbid disease 
and concomitant medications as well as genetic polymorphism of enzymes and 
proteins linked to the metabolism of drugs and overall dose of drug (Harshad 
Devarbhavi 2012).

Choking on the capsule 
Patients of any age may experience difficulty taking any type of medication 
for psychological as well as anatomical and developmental reasons. In 
SPRINT, none of the patients reported an adverse event relating to swallowing 
or choking, nor were there any diary entries to indicate that choking had been 
as a result of, or prevented them from taking, their medication. 
Since no reports that are suggestive of choking have been received for 
selumetinib in the paediatric population it is not possible to state what risk 
factors or risk groups can be identified. There is a theoretical risk that patients 
with large PN in the head and neck region who experience dysphagia may be 
at increased risk of choking on the capsule.  
In general, risks relating to choking and adverse swallow events have been 
shown to be influenced by a child’s demeanour prior to, and at the time of, 
taking a medicine. In a study of 1677 children (aged 1 year to 4 years and 11 
months given albendazole tablets as part of a WHO global programme to 
eliminate soil-transmitted helminthiasis) by Kernell et al 2018, three key risk 
factors were identified for choking: non-content child demeanour before 
administration, child struggling during administration, and the addition of 
water. The authors went on to demonstrate in a multivariate analysis that child 
demeanour was the only risk factor that was significantly associated with 
choking amongst children aged 1 year to 4 years and 11 months.

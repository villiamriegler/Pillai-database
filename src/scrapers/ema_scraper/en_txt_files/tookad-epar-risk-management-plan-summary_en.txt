Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan 
 
 
Summary of risk management plan for TOOKAD® 
(Padeliporfin) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for TOOKAD®. The RMP details important risks 
of TOOKAD®, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about 
TOOKAD®'s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
TOOKAD®'s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how TOOKAD® should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for TOOKAD® should be read in the context of all this information including 
the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of TOOKAD®'s RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
TOOKAD® is authorised for treatment of adult men who have low-risk, localised prostate cancer in only 
one lobe, using a technique called Vascular-Targeted Photodynamic (VTP) therapy (see SmPC for the 
full indication).  
It contains padeliporfin as the active substance and it is given by the intravenous route of 
administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of TOOKAD®’s benefits can be found in TOOKAD®’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage  
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/overview/tookad-epar-summary-public_en.pdf  
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to 
minimise or further characterise the risks  
Important risks of TOOKAD®, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed studies 
for learning more about TOOKAD®'s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
 
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of TOOKAD®, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation measures 
mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
 
 
 
 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of TOOKAD® is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of TOOKAD® are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of TOOKAD®. Potential risks are concerns for which an association 
with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been 
established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of 
the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of 
the medicine);

II.B Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk: Photosensitivity 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
Due to the mechanism of action whereby TOOKAD is activated by 
the medicine 
a specific wavelength of light, there is the possibility that whilst 
the drug remains in the blood stream, exposed areas of the body 
including the eyes may become photosensitive to bright light, in 
particular sunlight, within 48 hours of treatment if the 
recommended controls such as protection from light are not 
followed. 
Important identified risk: Photosensitivity 
Risk factors and risk groups 
The key groups at risk are those patients with known porphyria or 
photodermatoses. 
Patients exposed to bright light within the first 24-48 hours are at 
risk of potential eye photosensitivity injury. Patients who have 
had recent anti-angiogenic treatment for AMD are also at 
additional risk. 
Risk minimisation measures

authorisation development plan. 
Important identified risk: Urethral stenosis 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
Although relatively uncommon, stenosis can occur due to the 
the medicine 
combination of having a urinary catheter in place and 
inflammation due to the procedure itself. Although this can be 
treated usually by urethral dilation and occasionally with a 
urethroplasty, it is considered an identified risk due to the 
unpredictable nature of occurrence and the severity. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
All patients require catheterisation but it is those that may require 
longer term catheterisation that may be at higher risk as well as 
those with a history of urethritis or previous transurethral 
resection.

Important potential risk: Complications of extra-prostatic necrosis 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
The procedure is designed to cause controlled necrosis of the 
the medicine 
prostate gland but if this is excessive it may extend into the 
rectum and it is possible that a fistula may occur between the 
rectum and the urethra. This is considered an important potential 
risk due to the serious nature of the event. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
The key risk factors for VTP are inappropriate placement of light 
fibres and/or excessive light exposure. However, patients with 
inflammatory bowel disease affecting the lower rectum may be at 
increased risk due to the added inflammation expected from the 
VTP procedure. 
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures 
  SmPC section 4.4 to provide guidance on the treatment

See section II.C of this summary for an overview of the post-

Important potential risk: Procedural related injuries and complications 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
The procedure requires trans-perineal insertion of needles so that 
the medicine 
laser fibres can be positioned correctly into the prostate. 
Inevitably this can cause an inflammatory process that causes 
pain and discomfort in the prostate as well as some bleeding. The 
use of a urinary catheter during and after the operation for a 
short period of time may cause other urinary symptoms including 
the possibility of infection. Such events may cause hospitalisation 
hence are considered an important potential risk. These effects 
are usually short lived and resolve completely. Similarly, some 
erectile dysfunction is possible as a common finding directly after 
prostate surgery improving over time. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
All patients undergoing the procedure are at risk of transient 
urinary symptoms principally because of the manipulations of the 
prostate including the insertion of needles and the need for a 
urinary catheter which can also be a cause of infection or 
bleeding. The bleeding risk is increased if they are taking 
anticoagulants or anti-platelet therapy or have a bleeding 
diathesis and possibly in larger prostates. Additionally, the effect 
of the treatment which is to cause necrosis initially will cause 
oedema and swelling of the prostatic tissue which can increase 
the risk of difficulties with urination as well as pain; as the tissue 
shrinks, these signs and symptoms tend to regress. 
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures 
  SmPC section 4.4 to advise of risks to patients with abnormal 
clotting; Section 4.5 to describe management of anticoagulant

Important potential risk: Long-term erectile dysfunction (>6 months)) 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
The TOOKAD VTP procedure involves the surgical insertion of 
the medicine 
needles into the prostate gland so the laser fibres can be 
positioned correctly. Erectile dysfunction is a common finding 
after prostate surgery and is more likely to occur soon after the 
operation improving over time; however, a number of patients 
have experienced long-term erectile dysfunction for more than 6 
months. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
From the data, so far, the greatest risk appears to be when both 
lobes are treated simultaneously so where only unilateral disease 
is treated once (as in the approved indication), this risk would 
appear to be reduced.

Important potential risk: Long-term urinary incontinence (>6 months) 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
Permanent or long-term incontinence (lasting more than 6 
the medicine 
months) is a potential problem if both the internal and external 
sphincter (muscle controlling the urethra) are damaged during the 
surgical procedure. It is a potential risk as usually the procedure 
is planned to avoid this complication. It happened only in a 
patient who had a previous prostate tissue resection via the 
urethra for an enlarged gland with damage at that time to the 
urinary sphincter and the VTP procedure is now not recommended 
in patients who have previously had such an operation. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
The main risk factor is previous transurethral resection of the 
prostate that damages the urinary sphincter. 
Risk minimisation measures

Important potential risk: Procedural related injuries and complications due to non-
compliance with the device manufacturers’ instructions and recommended guidance for 
the VTP Procedure 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
If the treating Physician does not closely follow the detailed 
the medicine 
instructions provided for use of this procedure, this could 
potentially result in an over-treatment of the prostate resulting in 
some of the treatment risks highlighted above. 
All the doctors performing this procedure will have been trained in 
its use but the circumstance of your own disease may mean that 
they believe that the treatment should deviate from the pre-
operative planning. There is a potential risk that this may result in 
more treatment than is required being given to the area around 
the prostate.

Important potential risk: Induction of more aggressive tumour histology by TOOKAD VTP 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
When the original biopsy was taken the type of cancer cells along 
the medicine 
with its location would have been of a sufficiently low grade to 
mean that the VTP surgery was applicable to the patient. 
Sometimes, because the biopsy does not sample all of the cancer 
tissue, it is possible that, on follow-up biopsy, if there are residual 
cancer cells, that more aggressive tumour cells may be 
discovered. It is possible that these were there prior to surgery 
and just missed on the biopsy or that these residual cells have 
become more aggressive. However, there is no evidence at 
present that the procedure itself influences the cells to become 
more aggressive. 
 
Important potential risk: Induction of more aggressive tumour histology by TOOKAD VTP 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Currently, there is no current evidence that the finding of a higher 
Gleason grade represents more aggressive tumour as a result of 
the focal therapy. The possibility that following focal therapy, the 
reduced area of prostate with multiple core biopsies allows a 
better chance to pick up tumour cells which could have been 
missed when the prostate was larger prior to treatment. 
Therefore, any focal procedure that leaves behind prostate tissue 
may carry the risk that previously undiagnosed aggressive cells 
may become apparent or progress to a more aggressive histology.

Important potential risk: Difficulty of subsequent radical therapy due to reduced size and 
fibrosis of the VTP-treated prostate 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
The VTP procedure causes necrosis of the prostate gland and 
the medicine 
causes it to shrink in size and become firmer. Also, in order to 
make sure that as much of the cancer is killed as possible, some 
necrosis just outside the prostate gland is normal and this may 
cause the prostate to adhere to adjacent tissues. While there is no 
current evidence to suggest that this makes the surgery more 
difficult it is potentially possible that, in some cases, the fact that 
the prostate is stuck to local structures makes the surgery, should 
it require removal, to take longer or have more bleeding than 
usual. In addition, it is possible that, if other radical therapy is 
required such as radiotherapy (either from externally or by the 
insertion of radioactive seeds in the prostate), this might not be 
as easy as if the VTP procedure had not been performed.

No particular risk factors or groups have been identified.

1.  Introduction 
On 19 June 2023, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Fycompa tablets, in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
Perampanel is a highly selective non-competitive AMPA-type glutamate receptor antagonist. In the EU, 
Fycompa  (perampanel), 
following  the  extension  of 
indication 
in  the  paediatric  population 
(EMEA/H/C/002434/II/0047), is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of: 
- 
partial-onset seizures (POS) with or without secondarily generalised seizures in patients from 4 
years of age and older. 
- 
primary generalised tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures in patients from 7 years of age and older with 
idiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE). 
Perampanel has also been approved as monotherapy or adjunctive therapy in paediatric patients with 
POS aged 4  years and older in the US as of September 2018. The International Birth Date is 23 July 
2012 in the EU (via the centralized procedure). Perampanel is marketed under the trade name Fycompa 
and is available as 2-, 4-, 6-, 8-, 10-, and 12-mg tablets and 0.5 mg/ml oral suspension. 
EISAI is hereby submitting final study results and report related to paediatric population for Study E2007-
M081-503  (referred  to  as  Study  503).  This  study  503  was  a  specified  Japanese  prospective  post-
marketing  observational  study  following  approval  of  Fycompa  Tablets  2  mg  and  4  mg  by  the  Japan 
Pharmaceuticals  and  Medical  Devices  Agency  (PMDA).  The  purpose  of  Study  503  was  to  evaluate  the 
long-term safety and efficacy of perampanel oral tablets in real-world adolescent epileptic patients, aged 
12 to 17 years, with partial seizures (including secondary generalized seizures) or tonic-clonic seizures. 
No adult patients participated in this study. 
The study enrolled 507 subjects (planned 500 subjects, 50 of which would have tonic-clonic seizures) all 
of whom were less than 18 years of age and treated with perampanel in the study. 
The submission of these final data is being made to the European Medicines Agency to fulfil the obligation 
to present data from any MAH-sponsored study in a paediatric population.  
The Japanese regulatory procedure for this type of study requires that the CSR be reviewed by the PMDA 
before it can be considered as the final CSR. However, it will be several years until the PMDA review and 
approve the CSR for Study 503, which is likely to be 2025 – 2026. Therefore, Eisai has decided to submit 
Study 503 for Art. 46 review now, and if PMDA revise the CSR a further Art. 46 submission will be made 
within 6 months of the PMDA’s decision. 
This study was conducted to meet local (Japanese) regulations and was not part of the PIP obligations. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that Post-authorisation measure - Submission of paediatric study pursuant to article 46 
of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 is a stand-alone study.

2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The investigational medicinal product tested in Study 503 was Fycompa as 2 mg and 4 mg oral tablets. 
Perampanel was orally administered once daily before bedtime. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
This is a prospective post-marketing observational study conducted following approval the 28th March 
2016 of Fycompa Tablets 2 mg and 4 mg in Japan. The study was conducted in accordance with the Risk 
Management Plan (RMP) and the protocol submitted to the PMDA the 15th April 2016. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Description/Methods 
This is a prospective post-marketing observational study assessing the long-term safety and efficacy of 
Fycompa  tablets  in  adolescent  epileptic  patients  with  partial  seizure  (including  secondary  generalized 
seizure) or tonic-clonic seizure in Japan. 
Table 1: Observation schedule

The observation period for a patient was 52 weeks after the start of administration of Fycompa and 104 
weeks at maximum. If the administration of Fycompa was discontinued before Week 104 of treatment, 
a follow-up period of 4 weeks after discontinuation was anticipated. 
Study participants 
Inclusion criteria: 
Patients with epilepsy aged 12 to 17 years and with partial seizures (including secondary generalized 
seizures) or tonic-clonic seizures 
Exclusion criteria: 
Patients with a history of treatment with Fycompa 
Treatments 
Fycompa® (perampanel) 2- and 4-mg Tablets 
The  usual  oral  dosage  for  adults  and  children  12  years  of  age  or  older  is  initially  2  mg  once  daily  as 
perampanel at bedtime, and the daily dose may then be increased by 2 mg at intervals of 1 week or 
longer. 
The  maintenance  dose  is  8  mg  once  daily  in  the  absence  of  concomitant  antiepileptic  drugs  that 
accelerate the metabolism of this product, or 8 - 12 mg once daily in the presence of such concomitant 
drugs. 
Dosage may be increased or decreased as necessary by 2 mg at intervals of 1 week or longer depending 
on the symptoms, but the maximum daily dose should not be over 12 mg. 
Objective/outcomes/endpoints 
This study was conducted to assess the safety and efficacy of Fycompa administered for a long period to 
adolescent epileptic patients with partial seizure (including secondary generalized seizure) or tonic-clonic 
seizure. 
Safety endpoints: 
 - Unexpected adverse drug reactions (ADRs were defined as adverse events [AEs] for which a causal 
relationship with the study drug could not be ruled out; unexpected ADRs were defined as ADRs which 
is not listed in the Japanese perampanel PI) 
- Occurrence of adverse reactions 
- Factors that may affect the safety or efficacy 
- Occurrence of adverse events related to dizziness, balance disorder, ataxia, and muscle relaxation and 
occurrence of falls 
- Occurrence of adverse events related to psychiatric symptoms (aggression...) 
Areas of safety of interest included: dizziness, balance disorder, ataxia and fall, hostility and aggression, 
muscle  relaxation,  dependence,  suicidal  ideation  and  suicidal  behaviour,  effects  on  the  cardiovascular 
system, effects on the growth of children, and safety in epileptic patients with tonic-clonic seizure. 
Efficacy endpoints:

-  Presence  of  seizures  by  seizure  type  from  1  year  to  4  weeks  before  the  start  of  administration  of 
perampanel.  In  addition,  seizure  frequency  for  each  seizure  type  from  the  4  weeks  before  to  the 
evaluation point was investigated at the start of administration of perampanel, at Week 12, Week 24, 
Week 52, Week 76, and Week 104 (or at discontinuation and Week 4 after discontinuation). 
- 50% responder rate (defined as the proportion of subjects with 50% or greater reduction in seizure 
frequency from baseline) at Weeks 12, 24, 52, 76, and 104 and by seizure type 
- Overall improvement of a patient’s conditions by the use of a 7-rank scale for “markedly improved”, 
“considerably  improved”,  “slightly  improved”,  “unchanged”,  “slightly  worsened”,  “considerably 
worsened”,  “markedly  worsened”,  or  “not  assessable”  at  baseline  and  each  evaluation  time  point. 
Efficacy  evaluation  criteria  were  defined  as  efficacy  rates  calculated  based  on  the  number  of  patients 
assessed as “markedly improved”, “considerably improved”, or “slightly improved”. 
Sample size 
500 patients, with an aim to include 50 patients with tonic-clonic seizure among the total patients. 
Rationale: 300 patients are required to detect at least 1 adverse event that occurs at a frequency of 1% 
with  95%  confidence.  On  the  assumption  that  the  dropout  rate  until  Week  52  after  the  start  of 
administration of Fycompa is 40%, the planned number of patients to be registered was set at 500 to 
secure about 300 patients who completed the study during the 52-week observation period. The planned 
number of patients with tonic-clonic seizure in this study was set at 50, which is 10% of the total number 
of patients.

Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 519 patients registered for this study, of which case report forms (CRFs) were retrieved from 
a total of 507 patients from 136 sites throughout Japan.  
Of the 507 patients whose CRFs were obtained, 505 patients were included in the Safety Analysis Set 
and 484 patients were included in the Efficacy Analysis Set (see Figure below). 
Two patients were excluded from the number of patients whose CRF was collected: 1 patient with no 
visits after the 1st dose and 1 patient with a history of treatment with perampanel before the start of 
this study.  
Additional 21 patients were excluded from the Safety Analysis Set: 15 patients had a seizure type other 
than  POS  (including  Secondary  Generalized  Seizures  =  SGS)  or  PGTCS  for  a  year  before  the  start  of 
administration  of  perampanel,  1  patient  did  not  receive  concomitant  antiepileptics  at  the  start  of 
administration, 4 patients were without evaluation for both seizure frequency and overall improvement 
after the start of administration, and 1 patient was reported with off-label use.

Figure 1: 
CHMP comment: 
The planned sample size of about 300 patients who completed the study during the 52-week observation 
period  taking  into  account  a  dropout  rate  of  40%  is  achieved  with  484  patients  (and  310  patients  at 
week 104) for the efficacy analysis set. The safety analysis set includes 505 patients at week 52 and 323 
at week 104. 
The patients’ exclusion of the safety analysis do not raise any concern. 
Recruitment/Baseline data/Number analysed 
In the overall safety analysis set, the mean (SD) age of patients was 14.4 (±1.7) years, with a minimum 
age of 12 and maximum age of 17 years.  
Males accounted for 59.41% (300/505) of patients in the overall safety analysis set:

Table 2: List of patient backgrounds 
The majority of patients had epilepsy for 10 or more years (319/505 [63.17%] patients).  
Symptomatic epilepsy was reported for 405/505 (80.20%) patients and idiopathic epilepsy for 66/505 
(13.07%) patients, while the epilepsy classification for 34/505 (6.73%) patients was “others/unknown”.  
The majority of patients (76.04% [384/505]) had partial epilepsy, 21.19% (107/505) of patients had 
generalized epilepsy and 2.77% (14/505) had undetermined epilepsy.  
The most common seizure type was POS including SGS (71.49% [361/505] patients).  
PGTCS were reported for 15.64% (79/505) patients. 
Table 3: 
The  majority  of  patients  (45.15%  [228/505])  had  unknown  aetiology;  amongst  patients  with  known 
aetiology, abnormal development of brain structure (15.64% [79/505]), and hereditary disease 13.86% 
[70/505]) were the most common.

Developmental disorder or cognitive impairment was reported for 379/505 (75.05%) of patients.  
Psychiatric  symptoms  (aggression…)  or  suicide-related  actions  within  2  years  before  the  start  of 
administration of perampanel were present in 13.86% (70/505) patients.  
The most common symptom was aggression in 61.43% (43/70) patients.  
There were no suicide-related behaviours. 
Table 5: 
The majority of patients in the overall safety analysis set used concomitant oral antiepileptics at the start 
of administration of perampanel (504/505 [99.80%]), of which 425/504 (84.33%) patients used 2 or 
more AEDs and 79/504 (15.67%) patients used 1 AED.  
Concomitant use of EIAEDs was reported for 142/505 (28.12%) patients (at the start of administration 
of perampanel).

CHMP comment: 
In the safety analysis set, a panel of 505 patients were included in this study. All patients were aged 
between 12 and 17 years old. Males accounted for 59.41% (300/505) of patients. 319/505 [63.17%] 
patients had epilepsy for 10 or more years. 
The  most  common  seizure  type  was  POS  including  SGS  (71.49%  [361/505]  patients).  PGTCS  were 
reported for 15.64% (79/505) patients. 
The majority of patients (45.15% [228/505]) had unknown aetiology; abnormal development of brain 
structure (15.64% [79/505]), and hereditary disease 13.86% [70/505]) were the most common known 
aetiology. 
Developmental  disorder  or  cognitive  impairment  was  reported  for  379/505  (75.05%)  of  patients. 
Psychiatric  symptoms  (aggression…)  or  suicide-related  actions  within  2  years  before  the  start  of 
administration of perampanel were present in 13.86% (70/505) patients. The most common symptom 
was  aggression  in  61.43%  (43/70)  patients.  There  were  no  suicide-related  behaviours.  The  symptom 
“aggression” is commonly described in the epileptic population regardless of the antiepileptic perampanel 
treatment. 
The majority of patients used concomitant oral antiepileptics at the start of administration of perampanel 
(504/505 [99.80%]), of which 425/504 (84.33%) patients used 2 or more AEDs and 79/504 (15.67%) 
patients  used  1  AED.  The  most  commonly  drugs  used  in  addition  to  perampanel  were  levetiracetam 
(34.18%), valproate (22.78%), lamotrigine (17.72%) and carbamazepine (10.13%).

Efficacy results 
  Percent change in seizure frequency (by seizure type) 
For  the  main  seizure  types,  the  median  percent  changes  in  seizure  frequency  at  the  time  of  the  final 
evaluation were: 
–50.00 for simple partial seizures (with motor signs),  
–73.33 for simple partial seizures (without motor signs),  
–28.57 for complex partial seizures,  
–62.58 for secondary generalized seizures,  
–20.00 for tonic-clonic seizures. 
Table 8: Seizure frequency and percent change (by seizure type) 
  50% responder rate 
In the 484 patients included in the Efficacy Analysis Set, the 50% responder rate in seizure frequency 
at the time of the final evaluation was: 
-  56.00% (28/50 patients) for simple POS (with motor signs),  
-  58.82% (10/17 patients) for simple POS (without motor signs),  
-  46.86% (112/239 patients) for complex POS,  
-  57.97% (80/138 patients) for secondary generalized seizures,  
-  41.56% (32/77 patients) for PGTCS.

Table 9: 50% responder rate in seizure frequency (by seizure type) 
CHMP comment: 
Considering  the  efficacy  data  for  both  endpoints  (50%  responder  rate  and  percent  change  of  seizure 
frequency),  Fycompa  is  less  effective  in  the  treatment  of  complex  partial  seizures  and  tonic-clonic 
seizures than for simple partial seizures with or without motor signs or SGS, which is likely due to the 
more refractory condition of complex partial seizures and tonic-clonic seizures than POS.  
Through a multivariate analysis, 2 factors were found to have a statistically significant impact of the 50% 
responder rate.  
Indeed,  the  50%  responder  rate  was  lower  in  patients  with  developmental  disorder  or  cognitive 
impairment, even whether the specific contributing factors were unknown and in the patients for which 
the baseline number of major concomitant oral AEDs was recorded as 2 or more AEDs which could be in 
case of a more refractory condition of the underlying disease in patients using more AEDs. 
  Comparison to other results of phase 3 studies 
For comparison, in Study 335, a Phase 3 study in subjects with POS, the 50% responder rate in seizure 
frequency was 19.4% (34/175 subjects) in the placebo group, 23.0% (40/174 subjects) in the 4 mg/day 
group, 36.0% (63/175 subjects) in the 8 mg/day group, and 43.3% (78/180 subjects) in the 12 mg/day 
group.

Table 10: 50% responder rate in seizure frequency in Phase 3 clinical study on partial seizure in 
epileptic patients (Study 335) 
CHMP comment: 
Study 335 was assessed within the framework of a P46 procedure in February 2021 and was a phase 3, 
multicentre,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel  group  study  with  an  open-label 
extension phase in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older who had a diagnosis of inadequately 
controlled partial-onset seizures. The study was conducted in Australia, China, Korea, Japan, Malaysia, 
Taiwan,  and  Thailand.  Subjects  were  randomized  to  1  of  4  treatment  groups  (4,  8,  12  mg/day  of 
perampanel, or placebo) in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. The study randomised 710 subjects (planned 680 subjects, 
170 subjects per treatment group) into the Core phase, 73 of whom were less than 18 years of age. The 
primary objective of Study 335 was to confirm the efficacy of perampanel (4, 8, and 12 mg) compared 
to  placebo  given  as  an  adjunctive  therapy  in  subjects  with  refractory  partial-onset  seizures.  The 
secondary objectives were a) to evaluate the safety and tolerability of perampanel compared to placebo 
given as an adjunctive therapy in subjects with refractory partial-onset seizures, b) to evaluate the long-
term maintenance effect of perampanel (4, 8, and 12 mg) given as an adjunctive therapy in subjects 
with refractory partial-onset seizures. Of the 679 subjects of the Safety Analysis Set, 73 (around 10%) 
subjects were aged 12 to <18 years. 
Even whether the provided study 335 data are interesting, their relevance for comparison with those of 
study 503 is not considered adequate in particular since the study methodology, the included population 
and the dosing groups are different.  
The  results  of  study  503  indicate  that  the  responder  rate  in  the  adolescent  population  is  distributed 
between around 40 and 60% as follows, with the smallest rate of responders in case of PGTCS: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
56.00% (28/50 patients) for simple POS (with motor signs),  
58.82% (10/17 patients) for simple POS (without motor signs),  
57.97% (80/138 patients) for SGS,   
46.86% (112/239 patients) for complex POS, 
41.56% (32/77 patients) for PGTCS. 
These efficacy results confirm the known efficacy profile of perampanel in the adolescent population. 
According to the Applicant, in Study 332, a Phase 3 study in PGTCS, the incidence was 39.5% (32/81 
subjects)  in  the  placebo  group  and  64.2%  (52/81  subjects)  in  the  8  mg/day  group,  were  considered 
similar to those in this study.

Table 11: 50% responder rate in seizure frequency in Phase 3 clinical study on tonic-clonic seizure in 
epileptic patients (Study 332) 
CHMP comment: 
The CSR of the Core Study 332 is dated 19 Aug 2014 and the Final CSR of the Extension Study is dated 
24 Feb 2016. Study 332 was a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group 
study with an open-label extension phase to assess the efficacy and safety of adjunctive perampanel in 
primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures in subjects with epilepsy aged 12 years and older. The primary 
objective was to demonstrate the efficacy of adjunctive perampanel therapy, compared to placebo on 
PGTC  seizures.  The  secondary  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  perampanel  in 
subjects with inadequately controlled PGTC seizures. 
In spite of knowledge that such an indirect comparison has no robust value, the MAH is asked 
to  clarify  to  what  extent  the  50%  responder  rate  on  PGTCS  in  study  332  in  the  8  mg 
perampanel group (64.2%) could be considered “similar” (according to the Applicant) to the 
50%  responder  rate  on  PGTCS  in  study  503  in  the  overall  perampanel  group  (41.56%). 
Moreover, according to the provided results, the 50% responder rate on PGTCS in study 503 
(41.56%)  is  even  rather  similar  to  the  50%  responder  rate  on  PGTCS  in  study  503  in  the 
placebo group (39.50%). 
  Overall improvement 
The  efficacy  rate  of  overall  improvement  (number  of  patients  assessed  as  “markedly  improved”, 
“considerably improved”, or “slightly improved”/total number of the patients excluding those assessed 
as “not assessable”) at the time of the final evaluation was as follows for the following parameters: 
- 
Intensity of seizure, 50.43% (232/460 patients) 
-  Duration of seizure, 45.41% (208/458 patients) 
-  Activity level of daily living, 37.08% (175/472 patients) 
-  Overall improvement, 50.63% (240/474 patients)

Table 12: Overall improvement  
CHMP comment: 
A multivariate analysis was performed for the overall improvement and 3 factors were found to have a 
statistically significant impact on their results.  
The efficacy rate of overall improvement was lower: 
-  in patients for which duration of disease was 5 years or longer (47.59% vs 58.82 [<5 years]) likely 
due to the refractory conditions associated with longer duration of disease.  
- in patients with psychiatric symptoms (aggression…) or suicide-related actions within 2 years before 
the  start  of  administration  of  perampanel  compared  to  patients  without  these  symptoms  (33.33%  vs 
52.93%).  
- in patients with concomitant use of antiepileptics that were EIAEDs; it could be suspected that patients 
receiving EIAEDs may have had decreased blood levels of perampanel, which could have affected the 
results. However, blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis were not collected in this study to confirm 
this assumption. 
Overall, the incidence of ADRs was higher in patients with a history of psychiatric symptoms (61.43%) 
than those without (38.97%), even whether the specific contributing factors were unknown.

Safety results 
  Extent of Exposure 
Most patients in the overall safety analysis set received an initial perampanel dose of 2 mg/day (318/505 
[62.97%]  patients)  of  which  98/149  (65.77%)  patients  received  concomitant  EIAEDs  (ie, 
carbamazepine, phenytoin).  
The mean total treatment period of perampanel (excluding an interruption period) in the overall safety 
analysis set was 70.16 weeks and for patients receiving EIAEDs it was 65.57 weeks.  
The average of the mean daily dose in the overall safety analysis set was 4.42 mg and the average of 
maximum daily dose was 5.95 mg. For patients receiving EIAEDs, the average of the mean daily dose 
was 4.86 and the average of maximum daily dose was 6.62 mg.  
About  half  of  the  patients  completed  the  study  (255/505  [50.50%])  with  250/505  [49.50%]) 
discontinuing. Most common reasons for discontinuation were AEs (121/250 [48.40%]) and inadequate 
response (117/250 [46.80%]). 
Table 13: Presence of discontinuation, reason for discontinuation, and presence of withdrawal 
symptoms 
  Adverse events 
In the overall safety analysis set, 388 AEs occurred in 242 patients (242/505 [47.92%]). 
Table 14: Occurrence of adverse events by seriousness 
A total of 213 patients (213/505 [42.18%]) reported 288 AEs that were considered ADRs.

Table 15: Occurrence of adverse reactions by seriousness 
The most common types of ADRs (by system organ class [SOC] with incidence ≥10.00%), were nervous 
system disorders (110/505 [21.78%]) and psychiatric disorders (99/505 [19.60%]).  
Common  ADRs  (by  preferred  term  [PT]  with  incidence  ≥ 5.00%),  included  somnolence  (68/505 
[13.47%]), irritability (43/505 [8.51%]), and dizziness (26/505 [5.15%]).

CHMP comment: 
According to the Applicant, the incidence of ADRs in this study (42.18%) was lower than the incidence 
rate of ADRs reported in the studies conducted at the time of approval (620/860 [72.09%]).  
The  adverse  reactions  with  higher  incidence  at  the  time  of  approval  (with  the  incidence  of  ≥5.00%) 
include "dizziness" in 40.47% (348/860), "somnolence" in 20.23% (174/860), and "irritability" in 6.16% 
(53/860). In this study, the 3 most frequently reported adverse reactions were overall the same even 
whether  irritability  is  observed  with  a  slightly  higher  frequency  in  this  study  (8.51%  vs  6.16%).  The 
overall  under-notification  is  not  unexpected  and  rather  common  for  products  that  are  on  the  market 
since some years. 
A total of 142 AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug administration were reported in 122 patients 
(122/505 [24.16%]), of which the most common AEs reported included psychiatric disorders (66/505 
[13.07%]) and nervous system disorders (47/505 [9.31%]).  
Table 17: Occurrence of adverse events leading to discontinuation of administration 
The proportion of "patients discontinuing Fycompa" decreased when the initial titration interval became 
longer,  and  significant  differences  were  observed  in  odds  ratio  for  "≥  4  weeks"  (OR=0.211,  P<0.001) 
compared to "< 2 weeks." 
The proportion of patients with "occurrence of adverse reactions" decreased when the initial interval of 
dose  escalation  increased.  Significant  differences  were  observed  for  "≥  2  to  <  4  weeks"  (OR=0.441, 
P=0.029) and "≥ 4 weeks" (OR=0.298, P<0.001) compared to "< 2 weeks."

Table 18: Interval of initial dose increase, rate of discontinuation, and incidence of adverse reactions 
for Fycompa 
CHMP comment: 
In  patients  who  had  their  perampanel  dose  increased  at  least  once  in  the  safety  analysis  set,  the 
proportion  of  patients  discontinuing  perampanel  decreased  when  the  initial  titration  interval  became 
longer, with a significant difference observed after 4 weeks compared to under 2 weeks.  
Also,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  adverse  reactions  decreased  when  the  initial  interval  of  dose 
escalation increased, a significant difference was observed after 2 weeks upwards.  
This  observation  confirms  that  the  most  appropriate  mode  of  administration  to  ensure  safety  is  a 
personalized  increasing  dose  in  a  smooth  dose  escalation  manner  conducted  on  a  sufficient  titration 
interval.

  Deaths, Other Serious Adverse Events (SAEs), and Other Significant Adverse Events (AEs) 
There  were  3  deaths  reported  for  this  study;  however,  1  of  the  3  deaths  (endotracheal  haemorrhage 
that  could  not  be  arrested)  was  outside  of  the  2-year  study  observation  period.  Of  the  2  deaths  that 
were within the 2-year study observation period, 1 patient died of unknown causes (AE reported term of 
“death”) and 1 patient died from the reported AE of “influenza pneumonia”. 
A total of 47 serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred in 26 patients (26/505 [5.15%]). Common SAEs 
(by SOC with the incidence of ≥2.00%), included infections and infestations (15/505 [2.97%]). Common 
SAEs (by PT with the incidence of ≥1.00%), included pneumonia (10/505 [1.98%]). 
A total of 15 serious ADRs occurred in 9 patients (9/505 [1.78%]). Common types of serious ADRs (by 
SOC,  with  incidence  ≥0.50%),  included  nervous  system  disorders  (4/505  [0.79%]),  and  respiratory, 
thoracic,  and  mediastinal  disorders  (3/505  [0.59%]).  Common  serious  ADRs  (by  PT,  with  incidence ≥
0.40%), included somnolence (2/505 [0.40%]). 
Occurrence of AEs related to dizziness, balance disorder, ataxia, and muscle relaxation and occurrence 
of falls caused by these AEs as well as occurrence of AEs related psychiatric symptoms (aggression…) 
were considered as AEs of important interest in this study.  
In addition, unexpected ADRs (defined as ADRs which is not listed in the Japanese perampanel PI) were 
also evaluated: 
•  A total of 32 unexpected ADRs occurred in 24 patients (24/505 [4.75%]), most of which were 
non-serious and each PT occurred in less than 0.6% of patients. 
•  A total of 31 AEs of dizziness occurred in 27 patients (27/505 [5.35%]) of which 30 in 26 patients 
(26/505 [5.15%]) were considered ADRs. No serious events occurred. 
• 
There was no occurrence of AEs or ADRs of balance disorder. 
•  A total of 1 ataxia-related AE occurred in 1 patient (1/505 [0.20%]). This event was considered 
an ADR. No serious events occurred. 
•  A total of 6 muscle relaxation-related AEs occurred in 6 patients (6/505 [1.19%]), of which 5 
events in 5 patients (5/505 [0.99%]) were considered to be ADRs. No serious events occurred. 
•  A total of 1 fall and injury-related AE resulting from AEs related to dizziness, balance disorder, 
ataxia,  and  muscle  relaxation  occurred  in  1  patient  each  (1/505  [0.20%]).  This  event  was 
considered an ADR. No serious events occurred. 
•  A total of 105 hostility- and aggression-related AEs occurred in 96 patients (96/505 [19.01%]) 
of which 3 events in 3 patients (3/505 [0.59%]) were SAEs; 100 of these events in 93 patients 
(93/505 [18.42%]) were  considered ADRs and 1 of these ADRs  in 1 patient  (1/505 [0.20%]) 
was a SAE. 
CHMP comment: 
The three reported deaths in this study are not considered related to the perampanel treatment.  
In addition to the SAE and AESI, unexpected ADRs (defined as ADRs which is not listed in the Japanese 
perampanel package insert) were also assessed. For more details regarding the specific ADR, see later 
on in the AR. Most AE were ADR and non-serious. Overall, no new or unexpected AE is raised during this 
study.

  Other safety findings 
• 
Presence of abuse/dependency 
No SAEs of abuse or dependency occurred. 
•  Occurrence of psychiatric disorder-related adverse events 
A total of 120 psychiatric disorder-related AEs occurred in 102 patients (102/505 [20.20%]). A total of 
3 SAEs occurred in 3 patients (3/505 [0.59%]). Of these, 115 events in 99 patients (99/505 [19.60%]) 
were considered ADRs of which 1 serious ADR (agitation) occurred in 1 patient (1/505 [0.20%]). 
Furthermore, a higher incidence in psychiatric disorder-related AEs were also reported for patients with 
recorded psychiatric symptoms (aggression…) or suicide-related actions within 2 years before the start 
of administration of perampanel. The possible reason for this being that these AEs may occur more easily 
in the presence of history of psychiatric symptoms. 
•  Occurrence of suicide-related adverse events 
Table 19: Occurrence of suicide-related adverse reactions 
Table 20: Occurrence of suicide-related adverse events by patient background factor (multivariate) 
A  total  of  6  suicide-related  AEs  occurred  in  6  patients  (6/505  [1.19%]),  including  3  patients  with 
intentional self-injury and 3 patients with suicidal ideation. All these events were considered to be ADRs. 
No serious events occurred.

The higher incidence of ADRs in patients with a history of psychiatric symptoms (aggression…) or suicide-
related  behaviour  within  2  years  before  the  start  of  administration  of  perampanel  (61.43%  versus 
38.97%) is explained by the fact that patients with a history of psychiatric symptoms were more likely 
to develop adverse reactions of psychiatric symptoms. 
As a result of multivariate analysis, the following factors showed a significant difference with OR >1: For 
the  factor  of  "psychiatric  symptoms  (such  as  aggression)  or  suicide-related  behaviors  within  2  years 
before the start of administration of Fycompa," a significant difference was observed in the patients with 
the condition versus those without the condition (OR=17.632, P=0.013). 
•  Occurrence of central nervous system adverse events 
A total of 138 central nervous system AEs occurred in 120 patients (120/505 [23.76%]). Common AEs 
(by  PT  with  the  incidence  of  ≥3.00%)  included  somnolence  (71/505  [14.06%]),  dizziness  (27/505 
[5.35%]), and epilepsy (20/505 [3.96%]). A total of 10 SAEs occurred in 8 patients (8/505 [1.58%]); 
the most common SAEs were status epilepticus (3/505 [0.59%]) and somnolence (2/505 [0.40%]). 
Table 21: Occurrence of central nervous system adverse events 
CHMP comment: 
The Applicant is asked to provide the narratives and outcomes of the three cases of status 
epilepticus. 
A  total  of  124  central  nervous  system  ADRs  occurred  in  110  patients  (110/505  [21.78%]).  Common 
ADRs (by PT with the incidence of ≥3.00%) included somnolence (68/505 [13.47%]), dizziness (26/505 
[5.15%]),  and  epilepsy  (16/505  [3.17%]).  A  total  of  6  serious  ADRs  occurred  in  4  patients  (4/505

[0.79%]);  of  which  somnolence  (2/505  [0.40%])  was  the  only  serious  ADR  reported  by  more  than 1 
patient. 
Table 22: 
•  Occurrence of coordinated movement-related adverse events 
A total of 1 coordinated movement-related AE occurred in 1 patient (0.20% [1/505]). This event was 
considered an ADR. No serious events occurred.  
•  Occurrence of cardiovascular adverse events 
There was no occurrence of cardiovascular AEs. 
•  Occurrence of adverse events related to eyes, skin, blood vessels, or aortas 
A total of 5 AEs related to eyes, skin, blood vessels, or aortas occurred in 5 patients (5/505 [0.99%]). 
Of these, a total of 2 events (pruritus and rash) in 2 patients (2/505 [0.40%]) were considered ADRs 
related to eyes, skin, blood vessels, or aortas. No serious events occurred. 
•  Occurrence of blood disorder-related adverse events 
A total of 4 blood disorder-related AEs occurred in 3 patients (3/505 [0.59%]) of which 2 were SAEs that 
occurred in 1 patient (1/505 [0.20%]). A total of 2 blood disorder-related ADRs (white blood cell count 
decreased and platelet count decreased; 1 patient each) occurred in 2 patients (2/505 [0.40%]) of which 
1 SAE (platelet count decreased) occurred in 1 patient (1/505 [0.20%]). 
•  Occurrence of endocrine system-related adverse events 
No endocrine system-related AEs occurred. 
•  Occurrence of abnormal lipid metabolism-related adverse events 
A  total  of  1  abnormal  lipid  metabolism-related  AE  (carnitine  deficiency)  occurred  in  1  patient  (1/505 
[0.20%]). This event was not serious and was not considered an ADR. 
•  Occurrence of increased weight adverse events

A  total  of  7  increased  weight  AEs  occurred  in  7  patients  (7/505  [1.39%])  of  which  5  events  (weight 
increased, 4/505 [0.79%]; and obesity, 1/505 [0.20%]) in 5 patients (5/505 [0.99%]) were considered 
ADRs. No serious events occurred.  
• 
Influence of perampanel on worsening developmental disorder or cognitive dysfunction 
Of the 121 patients without developmental disorder or cognitive dysfunction at the start of administration 
of Fycompa, there was no patient with the influence of Fycompa (worsening). Of the 59 patients who 
discontinued  Fycompa  treatment,  none  of  them  was  with  the  "presence  of  influence  (worsening)"  of 
Fycompa. 
Of the 379 patients with developmental disorder or cognitive dysfunction at the start of administration 
with  Fycompa,  0.26%  (1/379)  patients  had  the  influence  of  Fycompa  (worsening)  at  Week  52,  and 
0.00%  (0/379)  at  Week  104  of  administration  with  Fycompa.  Of  the  188  patients  who  discontinued 
Fycompa treatment, 3.72% (7/188) patients had the influence of Fycompa (worsening) at the time of 
discontinuation, and 0.53% (1/188) at 4 weeks after discontinuation. 
Table 23: Presence of influence (worsening) of Fycompa on development disorder or cognitive 
dysfunction 
There  were  15  ADRs  reported  for  worsening  of  developmental  disorder  or  cognitive  dysfunction  by 
perampanel  in  13  patients  (13/505  [2.57%])  of  which  2  were  serious  ADRs  (agitation  and  coma,  1 
patient each) that occurred in 2 patients (2/505 [0.40%]).

Table 24: Occurrence of adverse reactions reported to be due to the influence of Fycompa on 
development disorder or cognitive dysfunction (worsening) by the physician  
CHMP comment: 
It  seems  that  perampanel  did  not  worsen  the  condition  of  any  of  the  patients  that  were  without 
developmental disorder or cognitive dysfunction at the start of administration of perampanel, including 
patients who discontinued perampanel treatment.  
For  patients  with  developmental  disorder  or  cognitive  dysfunction  at  the  start  of  administration  with 
Fycompa, 0.26% (1/379) patients had the influence of Fycompa (worsening) at Week 52, and 0.00% 
(0/379) at Week 104 of administration with Fycompa. Of the 188 patients who discontinued Fycompa 
treatment,  3.72%  (7/188)  patients  had  the  influence  of  Fycompa  (worsening)  at  the  time  of 
discontinuation, and 0.53% (1/188) at 4 weeks after discontinuation.  
The  methodology  of  the  study  did  not  allow  to  impute  (or  not)  the  worsening  of  Fycompa  on 
developmental  disorder  or  cognitive  dysfunction.  It  is  however  reassuring  to  observe  that  there  is  no 
worsening of developmental and cognitive condition during the study in patients without these kind of 
disorders at the start of administration. 
•  Occurrence of memory and learning-related adverse events 
A total of 1 memory and learning-related AE occurred in 1 patient (1/505 [0.20%]) which was considered 
an ADR (amnesia). No serious events occurred.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
EISAI submitted final study results and report related to paediatric population for Study E2007-M081-
503  (referred  to  as  Study  503).  This  study  503  was  a  specified  Japanese  prospective  post-marketing 
observational study following approval of Fycompa Tablets 2 mg and 4 mg by the Japan Pharmaceuticals 
and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). The purpose of Study 503 was to evaluate the long-term safety 
and efficacy of perampanel oral tablets in real-world adolescent epileptic patients, aged 12 to 17 years, 
with partial seizures (including secondary generalized seizures) or tonic-clonic seizures. No adult patients 
participated in this study. 
The study enrolled 507 subjects (planned 500 subjects, 50 of which would have tonic-clonic seizures) all 
of whom were less than 18 years of age and treated with perampanel in the study. 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/483426/2023  
Page 26/29 
 
 
 
 
The  results  of  this  prospective  post-marketing  observational  study  shows  that  perampanel  remains 
generally well tolerated, safe, and efficacious in the long-term treatment of adolescent epileptic patients 
with  POS  (including  SGS).  A  clarification  is  asked  regarding  the  PGTCS.  Indeed,  the  MAH  is  asked  to 
clarify to what extent the 50% responder rate on PGTCS in study 332 in the 8 mg perampanel group 
(64.2%) could be considered similar to the 50% responder rate on PGTCS in study 503 in the overall 
perampanel group (41.56%). Moreover, according to the provided results, the 50% responder rate on 
PGTCS in study 503 (41.56%) is even rather similar to the 50% responder rate on PGTCS in study 332 
in the placebo group (39.50%). 
The AEs described in Study 503 are consistent with the known safety profile for perampanel in the age 
population studied (12 to 17 years), and as seen in the epilepsy population. A review of these AEs does 
not  suggest  new  or  unexpected  information.  A  clarification  is  asked  regarding  the  narratives  and 
outcomes of the three cases of status epilepticus. 
A  total  of  32  unexpected  ADRs  occurred  in  24  patients  (24/505  [4.75%]),  most  of  which  were  non-
serious and each PT occurred in less than 0.6% of patients. 
On  the  basis  of  a  review  of  the  AEs  and  AESIs  in  Study  503,  no  additional  changes  to  the  SmPC  or 
regional product labelling safety information are requested by the Applicant. The data submitted do not 
influence the benefit risk balance for perampanel. Perampanel continues to possess a favorable benefit-
risk profile for the treatment of indicated seizure types. 
3.  Rapporteur’s CHMP overall conclusion and 
recommendation 
  Fulfilled: 
  Not fulfilled: 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should provide satisfactory response to the clarification as part 
of this procedure. (see section “Request for supplementary information”) 
4.  Request for supplementary information 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this procedure: 
1.  In spite of knowledge that such an indirect comparison has no robust value, the MAH is asked to 
clarify to what extent the 50% responder rate on PGTCS in study 332 in the 8 mg perampanel 
group (64.2%) could be considered “similar” (according to the Applicant) to the 50% responder 
rate on PGTCS in study 503 in the overall perampanel group (41.56%). Moreover, according to 
the provided results, the 50% responder rate on PGTCS in study 503 (41.56%) is even rather 
similar to the 50% responder rate on PGTCS in study 332 in the placebo group (39.50%). 
2.  The  Applicant  is  asked  to  provide  the  narratives  and  outcomes  of  the  three  cases  of  status 
epilepticus. 
The timetable is a 30 day response timetable without clock stop.

MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
Following  receipt  of  the  Day  30  preliminary  Assessment  Report  and  Request  for  Supplementary 
Information  (EMA/CHMP/400031/2023)  received  on  14  September  2023,  the  MAH  provided  the 
responses to the Request for Supplementary Information on 19 September 2023. 
Question 1 
In spite of knowledge that such an indirect comparison has no robust value, the MAH is asked 
to  clarify  to  what  extent  the  50%  responder  rate  on  PGTCS  in  study  332  in  the  8  mg 
perampanel group (64.2%) could be considered “similar” (according to the Applicant) to the 
50% responder rate on PGTCS in study 503 in the overall perampanel group (41.56%). 
Moreover, according to the provided results, the 50% responder rate on PGTCS in study 503 
(41.56%) is even rather similar to the 50% responder rate on PGTCS in study 503 [sic; believe 
should be Study 332] in the placebo group (39.50%). 
Applicant’s Response 
The word “comparable” in the translated CSR (pg 116) was not the most appropriate choice of word to 
use in the translation from Japanese to English in this case. In the Japanese original report for Study 
503, the sentence was written as “… which was consistent to the 50% responder rate of seizure frequency 
at the time of approval”. We would like to clarify that this phrase was intended as an overall statement 
encompassing both partial seizures and PGTCS collectively, but not narrowly referring to PGTCS alone. 
When examining by seizure types, 50% responder rate for total partial seizures was 48.00% in Study 
503 which is in alignment of the 50% responder rate observed in Study 335 (23.0% [4 mg], 36.0% [8 
mg], 43.3% [12 mg]). For PGTCS, we acknowledge that the 50% responder rate reported in Study 503 
(41.56%) appears to be lower than that reported in Study 332 (64.2%). One plausible explanation for 
this apparent difference is that the mean daily dose administered in Study 503 was 3.97 ± 2.18 mg for 
tonic-clonic seizures, which is approximately half of the fixed dose of 8 mg evaluated in Study 332. Of 
note,  unlike  Study  332  which  was  a  controlled,  interventional  study  with  a  fixed  prespecified  dose  of 
perampanel under investigation, Study 503 was conducted as an observational study based on electronic 
data  capture  that  reflected  clinical  practice  in  real  world  setting  where  prescription  of  perampanel 
including its dosage was at independent discretion of the treating physician. 
We agree with the assessor that such indirect comparison between interventional and non-interventional 
studies has its limitations. 
CHMP comment:  
The  MAH’s  justification  is  acceptable  and  this  confirms  that  such  indirect  comparison  is  not 
recommended. Issue solved. 
Question 2 
The Applicant is asked to provide the narratives and outcomes of the three cases of status 
epilepticus. 
Applicant’s Response 
The CIOMS form and/or AE report for the three subjects with status epilepticus are attached in Appendix 
1. See response document for more details. 
The outcomes of the 3 cases were as follows: all 3 patients (all male, age ranged from 12 to 17 years) 
recovered from status epilepticus without sequelae.

Latency  of  event  from  perampanel  treatment  initiation  to  event  onset  ranged  from  163  days  to 
approximately  1.5  year.  Perampanel  treatment  and  dose  were  maintained  in  two  cases  (negative 
dechallenge),  and  were  maintained  initially  in  one  case  but  eventually  discontinued  (positive 
dechallenge).  In  this  latter  case,  fosphenytoin  treatment  and  adjustments  to  other  concomitant 
antiseizure medications (ASMs) may have resulted in event resolution.  
There was no case with a positive rechallenge.  
Of  the  3  cases,  1  patient  had  a  history  of  status  epilepticus  reported  prior  to  perampanel  treatment 
initiation. Causality was assessed to be possibly related to perampanel (dose at onset, 6 mg/day) and 
co-suspect phenytoin in a patient with a history of status epilepticus in 1 case, not related to perampanel 
(dose at onset, 8 mg/day) with alternate cause being underlying disease (epilepsy) in 1 case, and not 
related (dose at onset, 3 mg/day) given the event occurred during dose  adjustments to  the patient’s 
other ASMs (co-suspects) and given the patient’s underlying disease (epilepsy). 
CHMP comment:  
The MAH provided the narratives and outcomes of the three cases of status epilepticus that occurred in 
male adolescents aged between 12 and 17 years old. All three recovered without sequelae. The causality 
was assessed to be possibly related to perampanel in one case and not related in the two other cases 
where confounding factors are present, in particular the underlying disease epilepsy itself. Issue solved.

  Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for edotreotide, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Considering the available data from the literature on misinterpretation of PET imaging due to uptake of 
68-Gallium edotreotide by splenosis and accessory intrapancreatic spleen, the PRAC considers a causal 
relationship with edotreotide is at least a reasonable possibility, in view of a plausible mechanism of 
action. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing edotreotide should be 
amended accordingly. 
In view of available data from the literature on the potential for misinterpretation of PET imaging due to 
uptake of 68-Gallium labelled somatostatin analogues by reactive lymph nodes following vaccination 
including cases with a close temporal relationship to receipt of COVID-19 vaccination, the PRAC 
concluded that the product information of products containing edotreotide should be amended 
accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for edotreotide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing edotreotide is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

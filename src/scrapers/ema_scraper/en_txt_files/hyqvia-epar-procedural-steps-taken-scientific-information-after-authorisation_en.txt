1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

(CIDP) as maintenance therapy after stabilization 
with IVIg in adults, children and adolescents for 
HyQvia, based on final results from studies 161403 
and TAK-771-1001; and interim results from study 
161505. 161403 and 161505 are interventional 
Phase III efficacy and safety studies, while TAK-771-
1001 is an interventional Phase I safety study. As a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.7, 4.8, 5.1,5.2 
and 6.6 of the SmPC are updated. The Package 
Leaflet and Labelling are updated in accordance. 
Version 14.3 of the RMP has also been accepted. In 
addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) 
took the opportunity to update the list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet. Furthermore, 
the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD 
template. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary 
of Product Characteristics, Labelling and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

The safety of HyQvia for use in human pregnancy has not 
in order to update the safety information regarding

been established in controlled clinical trials and therefore 
pregnancy, fertility and lactation following new 
additional preclinical data. 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
Furthermore, the Annex II has been revised to 
remove educational material based on the availability 
of additional new data. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder took 
the opportunity to update the list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet and to make

should only be given with caution to pregnant women and 
breast-feeding mothers. SCIg products have been shown to 
cross the placenta, increasingly during the third trimester. 
Clinical experience with immunoglobulins suggests that no 
harmful effects on the course of pregnancy, or on the 
foetus and the neonate are to be expected. 
Development and reproductive toxicology studies have 
been conducted with recombinant human hyaluronidase in 
mice and rabbits. No adverse effects on pregnancy and 
foetal development were associated with anti-rHuPH20 
antibodies and extensive nonclinical safety data package

does not support prior theoretical concerns that anti-
rHuPH20 antibodies could potentially affect fertility or 
pregnancy. In these studies, maternal antibodies to 
recombinant human hyaluronidase were transferred to 
offspring in utero. The effects of antibodies to the 
recombinant human hyaluronidase component of HyQvia on 
the human embryo or on human foetal development are 
currently unknown. 
If a woman becomes pregnant, the treating physician 
should encourage her to participate in the pregnancy 
registry. 
Immunoglobulins are excreted into the milk and may 
contribute to protecting the neonate from pathogens which 
have a mucosal portal of entry. 
There are currently no clinical safety data for HyQvia on 
fertility available. 
In conclusion, the available data indicates that 
administration of the rHuPH20 component of HyQvia to 
pregnant women or individuals of child-bearing potential 
does not impose an additional safety risk.

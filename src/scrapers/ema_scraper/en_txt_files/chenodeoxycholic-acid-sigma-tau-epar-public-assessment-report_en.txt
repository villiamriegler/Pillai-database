Applicant’s request for consideration 
Marketing Authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
The applicant provided a justification for its application for a Marketing Authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances in accordance with Article 14(8) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 based on the following 
claims: the applicant justified that he is unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and 
safety under normal conditions of use, because: the indications for which the product in question is 
intended are encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide 
comprehensive evidence, and that it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical 
ethics to collect such information.  
The applicant proposed as specific obligation to expand the data available and collect long-term data 
on the clinical safety and efficacy of chenodeoxycholic acid in the treatment cerebrotendinous 
xanthomatosis by establishing a patient database. 
Protocol assistance  
The applicant did not seek protocol assistance at the CHMP.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
The inborn errors of bile acid synthesis are a category of metabolic liver diseases (Setchell & Heubi, 
2006). These conditions are extremely rare genetic disorders. Individuals with inborn errors of bile acid 
synthesis lack the enzymes needed to synthesize the primary bile acids. This deficiency in activity of 
specific enzymes results in diminished production of primary bile and the concomitant production of 
high concentrations of atypical bile acids and bile acid intermediates (Heubi et al., 2007). The absence 
of primary bile acids causes hepatocytes to continuously metabolize cholesterol in an attempt to 
established normal bile acid pool. The result is the continued production of high concentrations of 
hepatotoxic metabolites, which cause a progressive cholestasis.  
Cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX; OMIM 213700) is an autosomal recessive lipid storage disease 
caused by disruption of bile acid synthesis that was first described in 1937. A deficiency of the enzyme 
sterol 27-hydroxylase causes the accumulation of cholesterol and cholestanol in virtually all tissues 
(Federico 2013, Skrede 1985). Fat deposition leads to the formation of xanthomas, nodules, and 
plaques in the central nervous system, tendons, skin, lungs, and bones. 
CTX is one of a group of neurologic disorders, collectively referred to as leukodystrophies, which 
predominantly affect the central nervous system white matter. These disorders are caused by defects 
in the synthesis or maintenance of the myelin sheath that insulates the nerves. The main neurologic 
features of CTX are cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal tract signs, and intellectual decline. One or more of 
these is usually apparent by late childhood or early adulthood. The syndrome is slowly progressive, 
and while there is no cure, its course can be altered with treatment. 
About the product 
Assessment report  
EMA/650359/2016

Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) is one of the five major bile acids in humans. The others are 
deoxycholic acid (DCA), cholic acid (CA), ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), and lithocholic acid (LCA). Bile 
acids are composed of four steroid rings forming a hydrocarbon lattice with a convex hydrophobic (β 
face) face and a concave hydrophilic (α face). This amphipathic structure gives the detergent 
properties to bile acid and allows for lipid and fat-soluble vitamin absorption from the small intestine.  
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This application is submitted under Article 10(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC (“hybrid” Application) using 
Xenbilox as reference medicinal product and is supported by clinical data and literature review. The 
applicant did not conduct any clinical studies against the reference medicinal product, which was 
justified by the differences in the indication. The application for Chenodeoxycholic acid sigma tau only 
referred in certain areas to Xenbilox and in all these areas there was no need for bioequivalence or 
comparable bioavailability studies to the reference medicinal product.  
In accordance with Article 14(8) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Annex I, part II of the Directive 
2001/83/EC the applicant applied for a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances. The 
applicant argued that he was unable to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under 
normal conditions of use because the indications for which the product in question is intended are 
encountered so rarely that the applicant cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive 
evidence, and that it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to collect 
such information. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction  
The finished product is presented as hard capsules containing 250 mg of chenodeoxycholic acid as 
active substance. 
Other ingredients are:  
Capsule content: maize starch, magnesium stearate, silica, colloidal anhydrous, and water

section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of chenodeoxycholic acid is 3α,7α-dihydroxy-5β-cholan-24-oic acid corresponding 
to the molecular formula C 24H40O4. It has a relative molecular mass of 392.56 g/mol and the following 
structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/650359/2016  
Page 8/47 
 
 
 
 
 
The structure was determined by elemental analysis, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, 13C DEPT NMR, mass 
spectrometry, IR spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction. 
The active substance is a white crystalline powder that may absorb humidity from atmosphere, and is 
soluble in methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, in acetone, in glacial acetic acid and in dilute aqueous solutions 
of alkali hydroxides. It is weakly soluble in ether and ethyl acetate. It is insoluble in water, in petrol 
ether and in benzene. 
Different crystalline polymorphic forms have been observed. The form manufactured by the proposed 
manufacturer is form I which is known to be stable from published literature. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory.  Adequate in-process controls are applied during 
the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for intermediate products, starting materials and 
reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. 
The active substance is packed in a low density polyethylene double bag as primary packaging and in a 
fibre drum as secondary packaging. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance (Ph. Eur.), solubility (Ph. Eur.), 
identification (IR, TLC), specific optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC), sulphated ash 
(Ph. Eur.), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), melting range, hydrazine, 
particle size (Ph. Eur.), polymorph I (X-ray diffraction), microbiological controls (Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from 6 production scale batches of the active substance were provided. The results 
are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Assessment report  
EMA/650359/2016  
Page 9/47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Stability 
Stability data on 5 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial package for up 36 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 
60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided.  
The parameters tested were appearance, assay, loss on drying, and related substances. Thus far, 
related substances have been quantified by TLC, but a more accurate HPLC method will be used from 
now on as requested by the CHMP. The HPLC method will also be used to measure assay (previously 
determined via acid-base determination) henceforward. So far the new HPLC method has only been 
used to measure long term stability data from one batch for up 12 months. Data on two additional 
batches for up to 12 months has been requested by CHMP. Full compliance with the proposed 
specification was reported, with no significant degradation detected under long term and accelerated 
conditions. The polymorphic form of batches was also tested at either 18 or 24 months by XRD. 
Results indicated that form 1 is stable during storage. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. The stability data 
provided shows that the active substance is not affected by exposure to light. 
Forced degradation studies under stressed conditions (acidic conditions (10% sol in HCl 1 N for 72 
hours), basic conditions (10% sol in NaOH 1 N), oxidising conditions (5% sol in 2-8% hydrogen 
peroxide for 72 hours, heat (130oC)) were also provided on 1 batch. These results provided evidence 
that the substance does not show significant degradation under alkaline, acidic or oxidising conditions 
but and is adversely impacted by the exposure to heating at 130°C.  
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months without special 
storage conditions when it is stored in the proposed container. However, the CHMP recommended 
testing the active substance prior to use in finished product manufacturing, until results at the 12 
month time point using the new HPLC method for the three batches become available. This data should 
be submitted through the relevant variation procedure. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as powder filled hard capsules with a yellow body and orange cap, 
containing a white, compressed powder. 
Chenodeoxycholic acid capsules were developed in the 70s and acquired by the applicant at later 
stage. They have therefore been on the market for many years. However, this product has a different 
indication (orphan) from other products containing chenodeoxycholic acid which are authorised.  
The aim of pharmaceutical development was to develop an immediate release capsule as it is 
considered the most appropriate dosage form for chenodeoxycholic acid and the proposed route of 
administration (oral use). During evaluation, it was considered that the proposed capsules were not 
suitable for use in children as they failed to allow the correct posology and also present a choking 
hazard. Therefore, the CHMP recommended developing an age appropriate pharmaceutical form for 
children or adults who cannot swallow the capsules. In the meantime, the product information was 
updated to include a description of the preparation and administration of a suspension to infants, 
Assessment report  
EMA/650359/2016

children, and adults who cannot swallow the capsules. The capsules may be carefully opened and the 
content added to sodium bicarbonate solution 8.4%. Step by step instructions are provided in the 
product information. The use of sodium bicarbonate as a suspending agent has been adequately 
justified and suspensions have been shown to be stable for up to 7 days. It is recommended that the 
suspension is prepared in a pharmacy and that an oral dosage syringe is provided for administration of 
the correct dose.  
Chenodeoxycholic acid is an organic acid. It is relatively insensitive to the influence of oxygen, light, 
humidity and temperature. The free acid is lipophilic and poorly soluble in water. At pH 7 the substance 
goes into solution slowly. It dissolves quickly forming the corresponding salt (depending on the base 
used) at pH values exceeding 8. 
The finished product is formulated from pharmacopoeial grade excipients commonly used for 
pharmaceutical presentations. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. 
The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of this report. The 
specific excipients were chosen for their known functions and comprise maize starch (binding agent), 
magnesium stearate (lubricant) and colloidal anhydrous silica (disintegrant and anti-adhesive). 
Different formulations were prepared and investigated during development which involved assessing 
the disintegration time and dissolution profile of granules manufactured with a varying amount of 
binding agent and granules manufactured with addition of various excipients. The formulation with the 
optimal disintegration time and dissolution rate proved to be the one containing the smallest amount of 
binding agent. This formulation was subsequently granulated and put into hard gelatin capsules by a 
standard manufacturing procedure without any problems occurring. The release of active ingredient 
proved to be rapid and nearly complete within 30 minutes using the chosen dissolution conditions. It is 
concluded that the formulation obtained with the chosen excipients is a product suitable for the 
intended purpose. 
Differences between the clinical and proposed commercial formulations have negligible impact on the 
release properties of the finished product. 
The proposed manufacturing process of wet granulation and tray drying is considered a standard 
manufacturing process. Therefore no extensive development of the manufacturing process took place. 
The primary packaging is PVC blisters sealed with aluminium foil. The material complies with Ph. Eur. 
and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data 
and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  consists  of  8  main  steps:  weighing  materials,  preparation  of  granulation 
solution,  granulation,  mixing,  pre-compression,  trituration  and  final  mixing,  encapsulation,  blister 
packaging,  and  secondary  packaging.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  standard  manufacturing 
process. 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process.

Product specification  
The finished product release specifications re-produced below include appropriate tests for this kind of 
dosage form: appearance, disintegration time (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), identity 
of the active substance (HPLC, TLC), purity (HPLC), assay (HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), and microbial 
purity (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines.  Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
The finished product is released onto the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  from  3  commercial  scale  batches  of  finished  product  stored  under  long  term  conditions 
for up to 26 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 
75%  RH  according  to the ICH  guidelines  were provided.  The  batches  used  in the  stability  studies  are 
identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging  proposed  for 
marketing. 
In addition, two batches were manufactured by the manufacturing process minus the pre-compression 
step. This manufacturing process is considered to be highly comparable to the proposed manufacturing 
process.  Therefore  stability  data  from these  batches  are  supportive  in  providing  relevant  evidence on 
final product stability parameters. For these batches, stability data for 36 and 24 months respectively 
under long term conditions have been provided. In addition, data from one batch used in a bulk hold 
study was provided. 
Samples  were  tested  for  appearance,  disintegration  time,  uniformity  of  dosage  units,  purity,  assay, 
dissolution and microbiological attributes. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
All the results complied with the shelf-life specification and no significant changes any of the measured 
parameters were observed. 
As requested by CHMP, updated stability results were provided using the new HPLC method for purity 
testing at the last two points of the long term conditions stability study after 23 and 25 moths for one 
batch and after 20 and 22 months for another batch. Considering the results obtained and the fact that 
purity after storage under accelerated conditions was not measured by HPLC, it was agreed that a 
shelf-life based only on long term stability data with no extrapolation based on accelerated data could 
be accepted in this instance. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 22 months with no special storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. The gelatin used meets the criteria as

Chenodeoxycholic Acid is a bile acid originating from cholic Acid that is extracted from ox gall. The 
origin countries are based on   Resolution No.18, 82nd General Session, May 2014 and the 
classification according to OIE rules (referred to in the TSE Note for Guidance EMA/410/01 Rev. 3) and 
the last GBR classification. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
- To test the active substance prior to use in finished product manufacturing, until results at the 12 
month time point using the new HPLC method for the three batches become available. This data should 
be submitted through the relevant variation procedure. 
- To develop an age appropriate pharmaceutical form for children or adults that cannot swallow the 
capsules. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity 
profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
The effects of chenodeoxycholic acid on the metabolism and secretion of bile acids are well known.  
Metabolism of bile acids is tightly controlled via a negative feedback regulation of bile acid synthesis.  
The applicant has provided a review of the pharmacological properties of CDCA. When given orally 
Assessment report

CDCA reduces biliary cholesterol secretion, and increases the proportion of biliary CDCA from 
approximately 33% originally to 70 to 95%, at the expense of formation of cholic acid and deoxycholic 
acid. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Following ingestion, absorption of CDCA will first be by the small intestine, and is then transported to 
the liver by the blood for further processing and conjugation with either taurine or glycine. The 
absorption of CDCA and other bile acids are already clinically well recognised and established, and 
pharmacokinetic characteristics for distribution, metabolism and excretion have been adequately 
described from the literature.   
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
General toxicity: 
Single-dose toxicity studies were carried out by oral administration to hamsters, rats, rabbits, dogs 
and monkeys.  Hamsters were the most sensitive species, with females being the more sensitive, 
followed by rats, rabbits, dogs and primates.  Findings considered CDCA-related were diarrhoea, 
decreased motor activity, flaccidity, atonia, prostration, fasciculation, bradypnea, dyspnoea, salivation.   
A number of repeat-dose studies have been reported with CDCA, and with a CDCA form with an olefin 
group (WP222).  These have been completed in rats, hamster, dogs, monkeys (rhesus and squirrel) 
and baboons.  The majority of species have been studied in excess of 6 months, and non-human 
primates were treated for up to 18 months.   
A number of deaths were reported in high and mid-dose groups treated with CDCA, in baboons (120 & 
320 mg/kg/day), squirrel monkeys (10-130 mg/kg/day), rhesus monkeys (40-120 mg/kg/day) and 
dogs (250 & 500 mg/kg/day). The cause of death was in most cases due to treatment with CDCA, and 
due in some part to liver injury in all species.   
The primary toxic effect of CDCA in rats, hamsters, monkeys and baboons is on the hepatobiliary 
system (liver and bile duct), similar to the toxicity of other bile acids.  Findings included increased liver 
weights, alterations in serum chemistry parameters indicative of hepatic (ALT, AST) and biliary (ALP 
and bilirubin) toxicity. Diarrhoea, gastrointestinal irritation and/or mucosal congestion were sometimes 
observed in the primate species at the high doses tested. 
Genotoxicity: 
Conflicting results on potential genotoxicity of CDCA in vitro have been presented by the applicant.  
However these studies were performed in only two strains of Salmonella tyrphimurium. It has also 
been seen in other Ames studies that CDCA was not mutagenic. There was also no evidence of 
mutagenicity in the in vivo rat dominant lethal assay.  It is therefore unlikely that CDCA acid can be 
considered a mutagen. 
Carcinogenicity: 
CDCA has been tested for its carcinogenic potential in a long term toxicity studies in hamsters and in a 
single GLP 2-year rat bioassays.  CDCA was not carcinogenic at doses of up to 120 mg/kg/day and 60 
mg/kg/day in hamsters and rats, respectively. 
Assessment report  
EMA/650359/2016  
Page 14/47 
 
 
 
 
 
Histological changes in the livers were observed in hamsters which consisted of increased bile duct 
proliferation and elevations in AST and ALT, although these liver changes are considered consistent 
with other signs of hepatotoxicity observed in other general toxicity studies. 
In addition, the applicant has presented several literature articles in which CDCA was co-administered 
with known rodent carcinogens to determine whether CDCA could act as a pro-carcinogen.  In these 
studies it was shown that when administered in combination with known carcinogens, CDCA induced a 
higher level of intestinal tumours, aberrant crypt foci in the colon and hepatocellular foci.  It is noted 
that the relative exposure levels of CDCA (and its conjugates) in these studies are not physiologically 
relevant and present an extreme situation when used together with other potent known carcinogens.  
Overall CDCA is not considered to be carcinogenic in hamsters and rats following long term treatment. 
Reproductive toxicity: 
The reproductive toxicity of CDCA was evaluated in fertility and early embryonic development study in 
rats, embryo-fetal development studies in rats, hamsters and monkeys, and a pre-postnatal study in 
rats.  None of these studies were completed in compliance with GLP. However, they were completed 
prior to this requirement implementation.  The documentation and summaries were therefore 
acceptable given the context of this application.  
There were no significant adverse treatment-related effects on fertility or early embryonic 
development, there were no CDCA-related effects on corpora lutea, or number of implantation sites.   
For embryofetal development, there was no evidence of teratogenicity or increase in embryolethality in 
rats, hamsters or rhesus monkeys.  The only significant finding was in non-human primates where 
there was evidence of changes in the liver (inflammatory cell infiltration and bile duct reduplication, or 
congestion of veins and sinusoids, and hepatic cell necrosis). Pathological effects on adrenals and 
kidneys were also seen in rhesus monkey fetuses. The pre and post-natal study completed in rats 
revealed no changes in terms of behaviour, appearance and bodyweights to offspring. There was 
evidence of a reduction in pup weight at the mid to high dose groups, but these weight changes 
fluctuated and were not consistent of the course of the study.   
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Chenodeoxycholic acid is an endogenous bile acid, which will be degraded and/or metabolised in 
environmental compartments without any Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity (PBT) risks. 
The applicant has provided a Phase I assessment to support the position that CDCA would not pose a 
risk to the environment when administered as 250 mg capsules. PEC surfacewater  calculated to be 0.01 
µg/L represents a worst case scenario ( assuming 100% market penetration).

class) 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical studies have been performed as sufficient non-clinical data was considered 
available.  The applicant relies on the data from the reference medicinal product and literature for all 
non-clinical aspects. The non-clinical development of CDCA as a medicinal product was performed over 
30 years ago and in accordance with regulatory standards of the day.  Extensive toxicology studies 
were conducted in the past and literature data were provided to support the pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and parts of the toxicology programme. 
Animal models of CTX disease have not been described.  The argument was that the pharmacological 
action of the endogenous CDCA is already well known and so the lack of strong supportive non-clinical 
evidence is superseded by the clinical pharmacology.  In the context of this application, the concept of 
using chenodeoxycholic acid in the treatment of inborn errors of bile acid biosynthesis in CTX patients 
was supported. 
In line with the recommendations of ICH S7A, safety pharmacology studies should address the main 
physiological systems such as the cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous systems.  In this 
dossier, no safety pharmacology data was provided but reference was made to the presented 
toxicological studies completed in rats, dogs and non-human primates.  No significant changes in 
safety pharmacology endpoints such as to behaviour, cardiovascular or respiratory have been observed 
in these studies. The data provided by the applicant was sparse.  However, taking into account the 
clinical experience with CDCA and the case of evaluating safety pharmacology endpoints as a part of 
the toxicology studies, no concerns were raised from a safety pharmacology standpoint. 
No dedicated juvenile toxicity study was conducted. However, the Applicant has argued that a number 
of studies for chronic general toxicity used young animals, in addition to the completed reproductive 
toxicity studies.  No differences in toxicity profile could be attributed to age of study animals.   
The applicant has not provided a full ERA, based upon the argument that CDCA is an endogenous 
substance and is found extensively in nature.  Although compounds such as these are no longer 
exempted as stated in the recently revised CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of 
Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2 *), the applicant’s argument has 
been accepted by the CHMP. Phase I assessment supports the position that CDCA does not pose a risk 
to the environment.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The submitted non-clinical data support the clinical use of Chenodeoxycholic acid in the treatment of 
CTX. Cross-references to Xenbilox as well as published data in the scientific literature were considered 
adequate by the CHMP

2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The clinical trial programme comprised two retrospective studies and was supported by literature 
review. No studies have been performed to determine the pharmacokinetic characteristics of 
chenodeoxycholic acid. The applicant has provided a literature review of bile acid kinetics and referred 
to the data available for the reference medicinal product.  
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
Table 2: Overview of clinical studies 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
Absorption  
Orally administered bile acids are absorbed by passive diffusion through plasma membranes along the 
length of the gastrointestinal tract, because of their hydrophobicity. Glycol- and taurine-conjugated 
bile acids are absorbed at ileum through receptor- mediated transportation (apical sodium-dependent 
bile-acid transporter, ASBT). In the presence of enteral bacteria, a portion of chenodeoxycholic acid 
may be dehydroxylated to form secondary bile acid. Absorbed CDCA enters the blood stream of the 
portal vein, and is taken up by hepatocyte via Na+-dependent and Na+-independent transporters.  
CDCA is completely absorbed when taken fasting or with meals. In man, it appears that unconjugated 
CDCA is completely absorbed from the small intestine after single doses of up to 400mg. Peak serum 
concentrations occur 50 to 120 minutes after ingestion.  There was no difference in peak concentration 
but the peak time was later when CDCA was ingested with a meal. (Van-Berge Henegouwen 1977). In 
a review of the pharmacological properties of CDCA, it was noted that when CDCA is taken with food, 
its absorption is delayed but bioavailability is not altered (Iser 1981). 
Distribution 
Distribution is mainly limited to the organs involved in the enterohepatic circulation: the intestine, 
portal circulation, liver and biliary tree, where CDCA exerts its major pharmacological actions. Plasma 
concentrations reflect the balance between intestinal input and hepatic extraction, and in liver disease 
the contribution of hepatic efflux due to diminished canalicular secretion will play a significant role. 
Therefore the therapeutic effectiveness of exogenous bile acids appears to be better related to the 
degree of biliary enrichment rather than the plasma concentration attained.

Elimination 
Removal of conjugated bile acids from hepatic cells to biliary canaliculi through receptor-mediated 
transportation, and bile is stored at gallbladder. Dietary fat stimulates secretion of bile salts. In total 
about 20 to 30 grams of bile acid are secreted into the intestine daily. About 90% of excreted bile 
acids are reabsorbed by active transport in the ileum and recycled that is called “enterohepatic 
circulation”. About 95% of bile acids in the portal circulation are actively up-taken by hepatocyte. The 
rest 5% enters systemic circulation. In the kidney, bile acids pass glomerular filtration, and are 
reabsorbed by proximal renal tubular cells. The un-absorbed bile acids are excreted from urine. As a 
result, about 600 mg of bile salts are synthesized daily to replace bile acids lost in the faeces and 
urine. 
Metabolism 
In physiologic condition, bile acids conjugate with amino acids, glycine or taurine, to form bile salts. 
Conjugated bile acids have lower pKa (1 to 4), which makes them much water soluble and easy to 
emulsify fats at small intestine. In pathologic condition, bile acids conjugate UDP through stimulation 
of UGT expression. Conjugated bile acids become removable from hepatocytes. 
Once absorbed, CDCA is bound to plasma proteins and cleared efficiently by the liver. Subsequent 
clearance from the plasma is also efficient, so that fasting serum levels of CDCA are barely detectable. 
In the liver exogenous CDCA is conjugated with glycine more than taurine, and secreted into bile along 
with the pool of endogenous bile acids in the enterohepatic circulation. Conjugated CDCA is either 
reabsorbed in the terminal ileum, or deconjugated before either excretion or conversion to LCA. 
Absorbed LCA is conjugated and sulfated in the liver to reduce reabsorption on recycling. Thus, 
continued hepatic sulfation and intestinal excretion of LCA prevent accumulation in bile. (Iser, 1981) 
Special populations 
No data is available.  
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Since CDCA is an endogenous bile acid used to replace a deficiency in CDCA in CTX patients, formal 
pharmacodynamics drug interaction studies have not been undertaken, and are not considered to be 
necessary. 
Data on identified and potential interactions between CDCA and other medicines originate from the use 
of CDCA in dissolution of gallstones. CDCA is known to bind with colestyramine, colestipol (both bile 
acid sequestrants) or antacid drugs containing aluminium hydroxide and/or smectite (aluminium oxide) 
in the intestine, thus preventing its reabsorption and efficacy. Consequently, the above listed 
medicines should not be administered together with CDCA. 
Additionally, oral contraceptives, drugs containing oestrogens and clofibrate may increase the 
cholesterol concentration of the bile.  The administration of oral contraceptives reduces the pool size of 
chenodeoxycholic acid. This may worsen the underlying deficiency and counteract the effectiveness of 
chenodeoxycholic acid in CTX. Co-administration with oral contraceptives is not recommended. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No pharmacodynamics studies have been conducted with CA by the applicant. 
Assessment report  
EMA/650359/2016  
Page 18/47 
 
 
 
 
 
Mechanism of action 
In CTX, deficiency of chenodeoxycholic acid causes a lack of feedback of cholesterol 7 alpha 
hydroxylase (CYP7A1) and HMG CoA reductase, causing increased production of atypical bile acids, bile 
alcohols and cholestanol that lead to the pathological consequences of the condition. Exogenous 
replacement with Chenodeoxycholic acid inhibits CYP7A1 (via nuclear receptor, FXR) and HMG CoA 
reductase, thus restoring the feedback inhibition. 
Primary pharmacology  
The primary pharmacodynamic effects of chenodeoxycholic acid are: 
•  Reduced production of cholesterol: reduces serum cholestanol (action on HMG CoA reductase). 
•  Reduced production of cholestanol: reduces serum cholestanol (action on HMG CoA reductase 
and CYP7A1). 
•  Reduced production of atypical bile alcohols and bile acids: through restoration of feedback 
inhibition of primary bile acid synthesis (action on CYP7A1) 
Bile acids have a multitude of functions as shown in Table 5 below. The individual contribution of 
different primary bile acids and their various conjugates have only been partially elucidated.

Secondary pharmacology 
No secondary pharmacological effects of CDCA have been reported in the literature. CDCA use in CTX 
is to replace a deficient or absent endogenous substance to physiological levels. CDCA has important

functions as a metabolic regulator and signalling molecule. Thus, no secondary pharmacological effects 
are expected with CDCA replacement therapy in CTX. 
2.4.1.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Chenodeoxycholic acid has been studied in the literature in terms of its pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics, and to a lesser degree as an exogenous pharmacological agent. Although 
chenodeoxycholic acid is a physiological compound, it cannot be assumed that it will behave the same 
way when administered as exogenous pharmacological agent. In this regard, a pharmacokinetic study 
with the proposed medicinal product would have been useful.  However, chenodeoxycholic acid has 
been used for many years as a therapeutic agent. Furthermore, since the pharmacological effects of 
bile acids are mainly limited to the entero-hepatic circulation rather than plasma, the therapeutic 
effectiveness of bile acids appears related to the degree of biliary enrichment rather than the plasma 
concentrations attained. Serial sampling of the bile pool would give the most meaningful 
pharmacokinetic data. However, the procedure is highly invasive and it would not be ethical to perform 
it on a serial basis. It is therefore acceptable that pharmacokinetic studies such as these have not been 
performed.   
The relevant interactions for chenodeoxycholic acid are expected to be those that are also relevant for 
the other bile acids that are used as medicinal products, i.e. cholic acid and ursodeoxycholic acid and 
therefore data on these other bile acids can be extrapolated to the applied one. The literature data 
indicate that some medicinal products may interact with chenodeoxycholic acid and appropriate 
statements have been included in the SmPC. 
2.4.2.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP considered that the available clinical pharmacology data were suitable to support the 
application for a marketing authorisation of chenodeoxycholic acid. The product information adequately 
reflects relevant pharmacology data. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy  
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
No dose-response or comparative efficacy studies were performed by the Applicant and there have 
been no prospective controlled studies for CDCA in CTX described in the literature.  
The clinical use of CDCA in CTX is spanning 40 years. The usual dose (750mg per day in adults and 
15mg/kg/day in children) was chosen empirically by clinicians based on the use of CDCA in the 
management of gallstone dissolution. It is sometimes increased in cases where the cholestanol and/or 
bile alcohol levels remain high on the initially prescribed dose.

Methods 
This was a retrospective, single arm, cohort study aimed at collecting clinical, laboratory and 
physiological data generated in a group of patient affected by CTX and treated with CDCA. 
For  each  patient  included  in  the  study,  demographic  data,  medical  and  CTX  history,  and  all  other 
clinical,  instrumental,  and  laboratory  data  generated  from  the  beginning  of  CDCA  treatment  up  to  2 
years after (with a minimum of 1 year) and at the last clinical visit, were reported. 
On-treatment assessments were compared to assessments at baseline. Post treatment assessments 
were from 3 visits: post treatment visit 1, post treatment visit 2 and Clinical Current Visit. The visits 
were at different intervals for each of the patients. To include as complete a data set as possible in 
both the studies as possible, the data collection for post treatment visit 1 and 2 was not restricted to 
the 2 years post treatment specified in the protocol.  
Study Participants  
Patients  satisfying  the  following  criteria  were  eligible  for  collection  of  retrospective  data  reported  in 
their medical chart:  
1. Having read the Information for the Patient and obtained a signed Informed Consent Form;  
2. Age between 2 and 75 years;  
3. Diagnosis of CTX of at least 1 year’s duration;  
4. Having received treatment with CDCA;  
5. Having at least one cholestanol level and/or urinary bile alcohol level no more than 3 months prior 
to  treatment  with  CDCA  and  one  cholestanol  level  and/or  urinary  bile  alcohol  level    post-treatment 
within  2  years  from  the  beginning  of  therapy  with  CDCA.  If  not  available,  qualitative  assessment  of 
cholestanol and/or urinary bile alcohols as recorded in the notes could be considered.    
No pre-determined exclusion criteria were defined in the study protocol.  
Treatments 
The patients received CDCA orally at 750 mg/day or 15 mg/kg/day. 
The mean (± SD) duration of treatment was 10.74 ± 6.66 years (median 9.00 years, range 0.4-26.3 
years). The mean (± SD) dose at the screening visit was 661.2 ± 177.4 mg (median 750.0 mg, range 
225-1000 mg). 
Objectives 
The objectives of this study were: 
- 
To evaluate retrospectively the activity of CDCA administered orally 750 mg/day or 
15mg/kg/day in reducing the serum level of cholestanol and, in selected cases, urinary bile 
alcohols; 
- 
- 
To evaluate retrospectively the safety and tolerability of CDCA administered orally 750 mg/day 
or 15mg/kg/day; 
To evaluate the impact of CDCA treatment in halting, slowing or stabilizing clinical disease 
through the evaluation of several parameters including disability scores, electrophysiological 
data, imaging data, laboratory parameters, disease signs and symptoms.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The study compared for the efficacy evaluation: 
1. Biochemical Outcomes on-treatment to baseline  
2. Clinical Outcomes on-treatment to baseline  
3. Disability Outcomes on-treatment to baseline  
The efficacy endpoints of the study were: 
-  Serum level of cholestanol;  
-  Urinary bile alcohols assessments;  
-  Disease signs and symptoms;  
-  Neurological disability scale (Rankin scale score, EDSS scale score). The Rankin scale measures 
the level of disability/dependence and ranges from 0 (perfect health without symptoms to 6 
(death). The EDSS also rates disability and ranges from 0 to 10, with 0.5 unit increments that 
represent higher levels of disability.   
-  Cognitive performance;  
- 
Electrophysiological parameters (nerve conduction in the arms and in the legs; needle 
myography in the arms and in the legs).  
-  Additional laboratory tests, if available;  
- 
The safety endpoints of the study were: 
-  Adverse events;  
- 
Physical examinations;  
-  Routine laboratory tests, if available:  CBC, including RBC, haematocrit, haemoglobin, WBC, 
differential count, and platelet count; chemistry panel including BUN, creatinine, sodium, 
potassium, AST, ALT, total bilirubin, glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, CPK, LDH.  
Sample size 
No formal sample size was calculated in advance. 
Statistical methods 
The following populations were considered for data analysis: 
1.  Screened population, which included all screened patients; 
2.  Evaluable population, which included all screened patients with  
a)  at  least  one  value  or  qualitative  assessment  for  cholestanol  the  same  day  or  before  CDCA 
treatment  start  and  at  least  one  value  or  qualitative  assessment  for  cholestanol  after  CDCA 
treatment start, or  
b)  at  least  one  qualitative  assessment  for  urinary  bile  alcohols  the  same  day  or  before  CDCA 
treatment  start  and  one  qualitative  assessment  for  urinary  bile  alcohols  after  treatment  start;

3.  Safety  population:  Included  all  screened  patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  CDCA 
treatment.  
Analysis of safety endpoints was performed in the safety population. 
Quantitative variables were summarized by using n (sample size), arithmetic mean, standard deviation 
(SD),  median,  minimum  and  maximum.  Categorical  variables  were  summarized  by  using  frequency

Results 
Conduct of the study 
The study was conducted in one study centre in the Netherlands.  The mean (± SD) dose of CDCA at 
the screening visit was 661.2 ± 177.4 mg (median 750.0 mg, range 225-1000 mg).  
Numbers analysed 
Data was available for 35 patients for the initial screening and baseline visit, for 32 patients (91.4% of 
enrolled) for post-treatment Visit 1, and for 33 (94.3%) for post-treatment Visit 2 and clinical current 
condition visit. All 35 screened patients (100.0%) completed the study. The age at first treatment was 
< 21 years in 15 patients (42.9%) and was ≥ 21 years in 20 (57.1%).

baseline. In patients for whom data were available, the majority had improved. A total of 86% 
(18/21), 100% (19/19) and 79% (11/14) patients improved at Visit 1, Visit 2 and current Visit 
respectively and the results were statistically significant (p<0.001).  In about 10% of the patients, the 
urinary bile alcohols level remained elevated. 
Subgroup analysis 
At least a third of patients in both groups had improved. The treatment effect was similar between the 
two age groups.

At baseline, 74% (23/31) presented with diarrhoea which resolved in all patients by the current visit 
i.e. 100% response. The improvement in cataract was mostly driven by the fact that 64% of the 
patients had their cataracts removed. There were little or no differences in the proportion of patients 
with the remaining clinical signs/symptoms compared to baseline

Table 8: Results of EDSS Scale (score) during the study (evaluable population) 
In  the  26  patients  (83.9%  of  the  evaluable  cohort)  with  Rankin  Score  assessments  at  both  Baseline 
and Clinical Current Visit, there was an improvement or stabilisation in 22/26 patients (84.6 %,) with 
Rankin  scores  improving  in  4/26  (15.4  %)  and  stabilising  in  18/26  (69.2%).  In  4/26  patients  (15.4 
%,), Rankin scores deteriorated.  
The  mean  score  of  the  Rankin  scale  increased  slightly  (i.e.  slightly  worsened)  from  baseline  to  any 
post-baseline  visit.  The  increase  from  baseline  was  not  statistically  significant  at  any  post-baseline 
visit.   
In  the  26  patients  (83.9%  of  the  evaluable  cohort)  with  EDSS  scores  at  both  Baseline  and  Clinical 
Current Visit, there was an improvement or stabilisation in 20/26 patients (76.9%) with EDSS scores 
improving in  6/26  (23.1%)  and  stabilising in  14/26 (53.8%).  In  6/26  patients  (23.1%),  EDSS  scores 
deteriorated  over  the  course  of  the  study.  The  mean  score  of  the  EDSS  scale  slightly  increased  (i.e. 
slightly  worsened)  from  baseline  to  any  post-baseline  visit.  The  increase  from  baseline  was  not 
statistically significant at any post-baseline visit.  
The  mean  (±  SD)  changes  from  baseline  were  0.12  ±  0.48  (95%  CI,  -0.08  to  0.32;  p  =  0.228)  at 
posttreatment Visit 1, 0.25 ± 0.83 (95% CI, -0.12 to 0.62; p = 0.171) at post-treatment Visit 2, and 
0.27 ± 1.24 (95% CI, -0.23 to 0.77; p = 0.280) at the clinical current condition Visit.   
The median score did not change from baseline to post-treatment Visits 1 and 2, whereas it was 1.25 
at baseline and 0.00 at the clinical current condition Visit.  
No  statistically  significant  changes  from  baseline  to  any  post-baseline  visit  were  also  observed  in  the

Supportive study 
CDCA-STRCH-CR-14-001 
Retrospective Cohort Study to Investigate the Safety and Efficacy of Chenodeoxycholic Acid 
(CDCA) in Patients Affected by Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis (CTX) 
Methods 
This was a retrospective, single arm, cohort study collecting clinical, laboratory and physiological data 
generated in a group of patient affected by CTX, treated with CDCA orally at 750 mg/day, followed in 
the investigational study site in Italy. The mean (± SD) dose of CDCA at the screening visit was 741.1 
± 47.2 mg (median 750.0 mg, range 500-750 mg).  The median follow-up of 5.75 years (range 0-25 
years).  
For  each  patient  included  in  the  study,  demographic  data,  medical  and  CTX  history,  and  all  other 
clinical,  instrumental,  and  laboratory  data  generated  from  the  beginning  of  CDCA  treatment  up  to  2 
years after (with a minimum of 1 year) and the last clinical visit, were reported. 
Study participants  
Patients  satisfying  following  criteria  were  eligible  for  collection  of  retrospective  data  reported  in  their 
medical chart:  
1. Having read the Information for the Patient and obtained a signed Informed Consent Form;  
2. Age between 2 and 75 years;  
3. Diagnosis of CTX of at least 1 year’s duration;  
4. Having received treatment with CDCA;  
5. Having at least one cholestanol level no more than 3 months prior to treatment with CDCA and one 
value post-treatment within 2 years from the beginning of therapy with CDCA;  
6. Having at least 1 routine laboratory evaluation no more than 3 months prior to treatment with CDCA 
and at least 1 post-treatment laboratory evaluation within 2 years from the beginning of therapy with 
CDCA;  
Twenty-eight patients performed both the initial screening visit and the baseline visit, 26 (92.9% of 
enrolled) performed the post-treatment Visit 1, 21 (75.0%) performed the post-treatment Visit 2, and 
26 (92.9%) performed the clinical current condition Visit. Twenty-five patients (89.3%) completed the 
study and 3 (10.7%) were discontinued. 
Objectives and endpoints  
The objectives of this study were: 
•  To evaluate retrospectively the activity of CDCA administered orally 750 mg/day in reducing 
the serum level of cholestanol and, in selected cases, other bile acid precursors; 
•  To  evaluate  retrospectively  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  CDCA  administered  orally  750 
mg/day; 
•  To evaluate the impact of CDCA treatment in halting, slowing or stabilizing clinical disease 
through the evaluation of several parameters including disability scores, electrophysiological 
data, imaging data, laboratory parameters and bone mineral density.

Rankin scale  
There was no deterioration in Rankin score in 61.5% of patients over the course of the study (range of 
follow-up in these patients was 0.5-13.6 years). The mean score of the Rankin scale increased (i.e. 
worsened) from baseline to any post-baseline visit. The mean (± SD) changes from baseline were 0.3 
± 0.5 (95% CI, 0.1 to 0.5; p = 0.016) at post-treatment Visit 1, 0.1 ± 0.4 (95% CI, -0.0 to 0.3; p = 
0.083) at post-treatment Visit 2, and 0.5 ± 0.6 (95% CI, 0.2 to 0.7; p = 0.001) at the clinical current 
condition Visit. The median change from baseline were 0.0 at any post-baseline visit.  
EDSS scale  
There was no deterioration in EDSS scores in 50% of patients over the course of the study (range of 
follow-up in these patients was 0.5-13.6 years). The mean score of the EDSS scale significantly 
increased (i.e. worsened) from baseline to any post-baseline visit. The mean (± SD) changes from 
baseline were 0.40 ± 0.74 (95% CI, 0.11 to 0.70; p = 0.010) at post-treatment Visit 1, 0.31 ± 0.66 
(95% CI, 0.01 to 0.61; p = 0.044) at post-treatment Visit 2, and 0.90 ± 1.13 (95% CI, 0.45 to 1.36; 
p<0.001) at the clinical current condition Visit. The median changes from baseline were 0.0 at post-
treatment Visits 1 and 2, and 0.50 at the clinical current condition Visit.  
Literature review  
The Applicant has undertaken a systematic review of published literature on the use of oral CDCA in 
the treatment of CTX and complied with the standard reporting guidelines for systematic review 
(PRISMA). The search was limited to articles published in English. Reporting and publication bias are 
potential concerns given the small number of cases reported in the literature as well as their 
geographic concentration.  A total of 112 articles were reviewed, and 70 articles were selected. Of 
these, 39 case series (2 or more patients) and 31 case reports (single cases). The Applicant also 
presented narratives of selected case series.   There were no randomised, controlled trials in CTX.   
Literature on treatment of CTX patients is dominated by oral CDCA supplementation.  Since 1975, at 
least 70 studies have been published involving approximately 200 patients.  In some cases other 
treatments where added to CDCA treatment or separately tested such as UDCA, simvastatin, 
pravastatin and LDL-apheresis. The age of the CTX patients at the start of treatment varied between 2 
months and 64 years, and patients were followed for a period ranging from 1 month up to 18 years. 
The common adult dosage studied was 750 mg per day or 15 mg/kg three times daily, however lower 
doses such as 300 mg/day were also studied. Response was measured in various ways including the 
biochemical parameters, serum cholesterol and cholestanol, bile acids and their metabolites in plasma, 
and bile, urine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations of cholestanol. Clinical parameters included 
cessation of diarrhoea, prevention or halt of cataract, improvement in neuropsychological and 
peripheral neurologic symptoms, bone density and prevention of progressive neurological dysfunction. 
A total of 204 patients’ data was included in the overall efficacy summary based on published 
literature.  Biochemical data was available in 174 (156+18) cases and a response was seen in all 174 
patients. (174/174, 100%). Biochemical response was given numerically in many cases but given the 
variability in units, combining data for comparison was not feasible and therefore the author’s 
conclusion was only included (significant reduction, normalisation- of cholestenol/bile alcohols).  
Neurological impairment was reported in a total of 97 patients, with stabilisation (or improvement) 
seen in 71 patients (71/97, 73.2%) and deterioration in 26 patients (26/97, 26.8%).  
Cognitive impairment was reported in 35 patients, with 31 patients stabilising (or improving) on 
treatment (31/35, 88.6%). Continued deterioration in cognitive impairment was reported in 4 patients,

on treatment. (4/35, 11.4%). The rate of deterioration was not described. Diarrhoea was reported in 
only 17 patients and was reported as resolved in 16 (16/17, 94.1%) with treatment.  
Epilepsy was reported in 18 patients, 16 patients showed an improvement with CDCA (16/18, 88.9%) 
and 2 (2/18, 11.1%) did not. Improvement or stabilisation in Xanthomas was reported in 2 patients.  
Overall, there was a universal biochemical response in CTX patients with CDCA. In terms of clinical 
response, over 70% of patients were reported as showing a stabilisation or improvement in their 
clinical status. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Although the applicant did not fully explain the choice of dosing regimen, the submitted rationale 
provides a reasonable scientific justification regarding the recommended dose.  
There are no specific validated neurological or disability scales that are available for CTX. The EDSS 
scale was originally developed for use in multiple sclerosis patients and quantifies disability in eight 
Functional Systems (pyramidal, cerebellar, brainstem, sensory, bowel and bladder, visual, cerebral and 
other). A score of 1.0-4.5 refer indicates that patients are fully ambulatory. Cut-off point of 4 was 
chosen to represent moderate to significant disability due to disease progression. The proportion of 
patients that progressed over long term follow-up to EDSS scores >=4 representing moderate walking 
difficulties and increasing need for assistance, is a measure of response to treatment, as with CTX, 
patients progressively manifest with significant disability through the course of the disease. As the 
presentation in CTX resembles the presentation of progressive neurodegenerative MS, the EDSS is 
particularly useful to assess neurological disability and disability in CTX. 
The Applicant has presented data on natural progression from pooled Expanded Disability Status Scale 
(EDSS) and age data in untreated CTX, based on the baseline values from the two retrospective 
studies and published case series because the majority of the articles on disease progression were 
published prior to the use of Disability Scales. This approach has been found acceptable. The Rankin 
score was developed to measure the degree of disability in daily lives of people with stroke or other 
causes of neurological disability, which is relevant to CTX.  
The Applicant defined all the variables and the set of rules for deriving new variables in the statistical 
analysis plan.  This approach is supported. The CHMP noted that all measures of efficacy had a 
considerable amount of missing data. The Applicant has presented some estimates of treatment effect 
based on within patients' comparisons. This approach may produce bias results if data are not missing 
at random and may reduce the precision of the analysis substantially as it is based on complete cases. 
Therefore, significant results need to be interpreted with caution. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The biochemical efficacy of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) treatment in patients with as 
cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) using widely accepted surrogate marker such as cholestanol 
and apoprotein B appears to have been shown in the published reports. 
The fact that there is no placebo arm, the lack of a control group with active treatment and the known 
limitations/deficiencies of retrospective studies makes the data difficult to interpret and conclude 
without uncertainties on the efficacy of the CDCA in CTX. The low prevalence of the disease has also 
been taken into consideration in the assessment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/650359/2016  
Page 34/47 
 
 
 
 
 
The clinical efficacy of CDCA treatment is more difficult to assess than the biochemical efficacy. A 
formal comparison of the long term clinical outcome of patients suffering from CTX with and without 
CDCA treatment would have been desirable. However, due to the rarity of the disease and the fact that 
most of the cases presented were detected at a symptomatic stage of differing severity, a formal study 
would require the inclusion of many centers and a long observational period to obtain any meaningful 
results, which would not be feasible in light of the rarity of the disease.  Furthermore, since CDCA 
treatment was shown to improve both the biochemical and clinical symptoms of this serious 
debilitating disease in many cases, it would not be ethically acceptable to withdraw this therapeutic 
effect from patients for a longer time period. 
It is therefore considered that the data showing biochemical efficacy and the associated improvements 
regarding the various disease symptoms after CDCA therapy compared with historical data of 
untreated patients provide sufficient evidence of CDCA’s effectiveness.  However, it is likely that due to 
the multiple nature of therapy (dietary, pharmaceutical, supportive) in these patients, there may be an 
element of overestimation in the clinical effects of CDCA treatment. 
The CHMP noted that apart from the low prevalence of CTX, the seemingly late detection in symptoms 
lead to irreversible damage, especially to the nervous system and connective tissue, which cannot be 
corrected by further therapy.  Nevertheless, for neurological symptoms after introduction of CDCA 
therapy, a demonstrable decrease of morbidity was found.   
The available clinical data do not allow correlating dosage and clinical efficacy. There is also no 
evidence of development of tolerance as there were no reported rises in blood levels of cholestanol and 
apoprotein B during long-term chenodeoxycholic acid treatment. 
The formulation administered during the pivotal clinical study (CDCA-STUK-15-001) was the marketed 
formulation of Xenbilox. For the supportive clinical study (CDCA-STRCH-CR-14-001) a compounded 
formulation of CDCA 250 mg capsules was manufactured by the hospital pharmacy and the patients 
were treated with this CDCA compounded locally at the centre’s pharmacy. Results of studies of 
dissolution comparing the two products demonstrated that, despite minor differences in excipients 
contained in the compounded and reference formulations, both products can be considered similar.  
Accordingly, the results of the 2 studies can be considered comparable to support the applied medicinal 
product.  
MA under exceptional circumstances 
The CHMP was of the opinion that comprehensive data is unlikely to be generated under normal 
conditions of use for the following reasons: 
Inability to provide comprehensive efficacy and safety data due to rarity of the indication 
The applied indication is rarely encountered. Indeed, chenodeoxycholic acid has been designated as 
Orphan Medicinal Product (EU/3/14/1406) by the European Commission for the treatment of inborn 
errors of primary bile acid synthesis on 16th of December 2014. At the time of designation, inborn 
errors in primary bile acid synthesis affected not more than 0.2 in 10,000 people in the EU. Given the 
rarity of the diseases, the CHMP considered that the applicant cannot be reasonably expected to 
provide comprehensive clinical evidence. 
Inability to collect comprehensive information because it would be contrary to medical ethics 
Assessment report  
EMA/650359/2016  
Page 35/47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It  would  be  contrary  to  medical  ethics  principles  to  collect  evidence  of  clinical  efficacy  of 
chenodeoxycholic acid in the applied indication in a placebo-controlled clinical study as it would expose 
patients to severe risks. 
In the context of a MA under exceptional circumstances, specific obligation(s) is included in the terms 
of  the  Marketing  Authorisation.  The  applicant  proposed  to  monitor  the  long  term  efficacy  in  patients 
treated with CDCA from a patient registry for which details are reflected in the risk management plan; 
the  CHMP  agreed  on  this  proposal.  The  registry  will  monitor  accumulating  data  on  efficacy  in  the 
treatment of CTX in infants, children, adolescents and adults.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP was of the view that data presented in this application shows both biochemical and clinical 
benefits of chenodeoxycholic acid therapy in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. 
The CHMP considers the following specific obligation necessary in the context of a MA under 
exceptional circumstances: 
The Applicant will establish a registry to monitor the long term efficacy in patients treated with CDCA. 
2.5.3.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Clinical data related to the requested indication was obtained mainly from two retrospective non-
interventional clinical studies.  Long term CDCA use in CTX as described in the scientific literature did 
not reveal any safety concerns. Additional data was derived from patients with gallstones for whom the 
reference product was originally authorised. The total exposure for CDCA was estimated to be 5,995 
patient treatment years. 
In two retrospective studies 63 patients were prescribed CDCA 750 mg/day or 15 mg/kg/day with 
treatment duration up to 25 years.  In the pivotal study, the mean (± SD) duration of CDCA treatment 
was 10.74 ± 6.66 years (median 9.00 years, range 0.4-26.3 years). The mean (± SD) dose of CDCA 
at the screening visit was 661.2 ± 177.4 mg (median 750.0 mg, range 225-1000 mg). 11 children 
were treated at a dose of 15 mg/kg/day. 
In the supporting study, the mean (± SD) duration of CDCA treatment was 6.68 ± 5.26 years (median 
5.75 years, range 0-25 years) and the mean (± SD) dose of CDCA at the screening visit was 741.1 ± 
47.2 mg (median 750.0 mg, range 500-750 mg). 
Adverse events 
Overall, the study medication appears to have been well tolerated in both retrospective studies. 
Adverse events from the two retrospective studies are summarised in Table 16 below.

A total of 76 AEs were reported in 26 patients (74.3%). The most commonly involved SOCs were: 
surgical and medical procedures (18 AEs in 11 patients, 31.4%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders (7 AEs in 6 patients, 17.1%), general disorders and administration site conditions (5 AEs in 5 
patients, 14.3%), and injury, poisoning and procedural complications (5 AEs in 5 patients, 14.3%). 
The most common AEs were: cataract operation (6 AEs in 5 patients, 14.3%) and fatigue (4 AEs in 4 
patients, 11.4%).  
Fifty-three AE of mild intensity were reported in 23 patients (65.7%), 22 AEs of moderate intensity 
were reported in 15 patients (42.9%), and 1 AE of severe intensity was reported in 1 patient (2.9%). 
The AE of severe intensity consisted of fatigue and was not related to the study drug. 
The three treatment-related AEs were constipation (2 AEs in 2 patients, 5.7%) and hepatitis toxic (1 
AE in 1 patient, 2.9%). None of the treatment-related AEs was serious. 
Study CDCA-STRCH-CR-14-001 
A total of 16 AEs were reported in 9 patients (32.1%). None of the AEs was related with study 
medication. 
There were no treatment-related AEs in any patient during the study. AEs and SAEs were reported in 9 
patients (32.1%).  AEs of mild intensity were reported in 1 patient (3.6%), and AEs of moderate or 
severe intensity were both reported in 5 patients (17.9%). 
The most commonly involved system organ class (SOCs) were surgical and medical procedures (9 AEs 
in 6 patients, 21.4%) and gastrointestinal disorders (2 AEs in 2 patients). 
Comparison with reference product safety profile 
Diarrhoea was commonly seen in patients who were prescribed CDCA for gallstone dissolution but not 
seen in CTX patients. In contrast, diarrhoea is a common disease manifestation of CTX which appears 
to resolve on treatment with CDCA. Mild, intermittent constipation was seen in 2 CTX patients on 
treatment with CTX.

Laboratory findings 
Haematology: 
In the majority of patients who performed the test at both the baseline and the post-treatment Visits 1 
and 2, the values of RBCs, haemoglobin, haematocrit, platelet count, WBCs count and differential 
count were normal at both baseline and post-treatment Visits 1 and 2. Fewer patients showed shifts 
from normal values at baseline to abnormal NCS values at post-treatment Visits 1 and 2, or abnormal 
NCS values at baseline that were normalised at post-treatment Visits 1 and 2. 
Clinical biochemistry: 
In the majority of patients who performed the test at both the baseline and the post-treatment Visits 1 
and 2, the values of BUN, creatinine, ALT, AST, glucose, sodium, potassium, cholesterol and 
triglycerides were normal at both baseline and post-treatment Visits 1 and 2. Fewer patients showed 
shifts from normal values at baseline to abnormal NCS values at post-treatment Visits 1 and 2, or 
abnormal NCS values at baseline that were normalised at post-treatment Visits 1 and 2. 
Safety in special populations 
No data is available.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Due to limited data and lack of systematic studies, no definite conclusions can be drawn regarding 
drug-drug or other interactions.   
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the absence of any controlled study data, no conclusions can be drawn on discontinuation due to 
AEs.

Literature review 
Only 1 relevant article describing an adverse event with CDCA therapy was identified. This single case 
of suspected toxic hepatitis (Huidekoper, 2015) has already been recorded in the retrospective study 
and has been described above.  
Mild liver abnormalities have been reported in the literature for patients treated with CDCA for 
gallstones, but it is not clear if they are due to pre-existing disease or treatment.  
2.5.4.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
There are significant differences in the pathophysiology between CTX and gallstone dissolution, the 
indication in which Xenbilox has been authorised. These differences impact the extrapolation of safety 
information at the recommended dose. Therefore, the primary data for safety evaluation has been 
derived from the retrospective studies in CTX. 
In the retrospective studies, CDCA exhibited a satisfactory safety profile, with only 3 treatment-related 
AEs. Although cases of diarrhoea have also been reported, this is a common symptom of CTX which 
resolved on therapy.   
The uncontrolled nature of the data rendered it difficult to evaluate the causal association. However, it 
is possible to conclude that the AEs reported with CDCA therapy appeared generally to be not serious 
and mostly related to the underlying disease condition. 
There were no significant changes in either haematological or clinical chemistry parameters during 
treatment with study medication. Treatment with exogenous primary bile acids is known to cause mild 
to moderate elevation of liver enzymes. The occurrence of one case of non-serious hepatitis would 
therefore be consistent with the study medication as a cause and an appropriate statement has been 
included in the SmPC. 
There are no reports on the use of CDCA in patients with renal impairment in the two retrospective 
studies and none were found in the literature. Under normal physiological conditions, CDCA is primarily 
excreted in faeces. Excretion through the kidney in negligible, but may increase in cholestasis (Alnouti 
2009). FXR activation by CDCA has been shown to modulate renal lipid metabolism, decrease 
proteinuria and improve renal fibrosis and inflammation in renal damage induced by a high fructose 
diet in Wistar mice (Hu 2015). As there is no data in renal failure with CDCA administration in patients 
with CTX, it is advisable that patients with renal impairment are monitored closely during treatment 
with CDCA. Similarly, as no data is available in patients with liver impairment not related to inborn 
errors of primary bile acid synthesis, patients with hepatic impairment treated with CDCA should be 
monitored closely.  
MA under exceptional circumstances 
The CHMP was of the opinion that the applicant was unable to provide comprehensive data on safety 
under normal conditions of use because the indication for which CDCA is intended is encountered too 
rarely and further data will have to be collected post-approval.  
In the context of a MA under exceptional circumstances a specific obligation is included in the terms of 
the Marketing Authorisation. The applicant will monitor the long term safety in patients treated with 
CTX from a patient registry for which details are included in the risk management plan. The registry 
Assessment report  
EMA/650359/2016

will monitor accumulating data on safety in the treatment of inborn errors in primary bile acid 
synthesis due to CTX.  
2.5.5.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The CHMP was of the opinion that the available safety data supports the Application for CDCA in the 
treatment of cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. 
The CHMP considers the following specific obligation necessary in the context of a MA under 
exceptional circumstances: 
The applicant will monitor the long term safety of CDCA in the treatment of CTX by establishing a 
patient registry.  
2.6.  Pharmacovigilance  
Risk Management Plan 
Safety concerns  
A detailed summary of the completed toxicological studies with CDCA are provided in the tables in the 
RMP separated in sections such as general toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and reproductive 
toxicity. The highlighted safety concerns are supported based on the non-clinical data presented for 
CDCA and the potential risks for hepatotoxicity given the adverse finding in non-clinical species.

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Chenodeoxycholic acid has been shown to have a beneficial effect in patients with CTX.  Its clinical use 
has been documented in the literature since at least the mid-1980s.  
In the pivotal study CDCA-STUK-15-001 treatment of CTX patients with chenodeoxycholic acid was 
associated with statistically significant decreases in mean serum levels of cholestanol and urinary bile 
level alcohol levels. Neurological disability scale scores (Rankin and EDSS) stabilised or improved by 
the clinical current visit in 84.6% and 76.9% of patients respectively. Mean Rankin and EDSS scores 
showed a very small increase (worsening) from baseline to clinical current visit at 0.08 ± 0.74 and 
0.27 ± 1.24 in the overall population and this increase was not statistically significant. There was a 
statistically significant (p = 0.04) improvement (decrease) of -0.31 ± 0.48 in the mean Rankin score 
for the < 21 years of age subgroup. 
Disease signs and symptoms resolved, improved or stabilised in a majority of patients over the course 
of the study. Diarrhoea disappeared in 100% (23/23 patients) of the patients who had this symptom at 
baseline. There was a resolution, improvement or stabilisation in 88.9% (16/18) of patients with 
cognitive impairment. Epilepsy resolved in 100% (3/3 patients) and polyneuropathy stabilised or 
improved in 100% (11/11). Pyramidal dysfunction improved or stabilised in 60% (9/15) and cerebellar 
dysfunction in 85.7% (12/14). Psychiatric impairment resolved, improved or stabilised in 85.7% (6/7) 
of patients.  
In the supportive study CDCA-STRCH-CR-14-001 treatment of CTX patients with chenodeoxycholic acid 
was associated with statistically significant decreases in mean serum levels of cholestanol from 
baseline to any post-baseline visit. The mean levels of 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3one significantly 
decreased from baseline to post-baseline Visits 1 and 2. Rankin and EDSS scores remained stable in 
61.5% and 50% of patients respectively, however there was an overall worsening of the mean score 
from baseline. Signs and symptoms of the disease remained stable in most of the patients. Diarrhoea 
improved or disappeared in 64.3% of the patients who had this symptom present at baseline. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Clinical experience has been reported in the literature from small cohorts of patients and single case 
reports; absolute patient numbers are small due to the rarity of the condition. This rarity also made 
the conduct of controlled clinical studies unfeasible. Many of the patients in published reports were 
treated with bile acids preparations in which CDCA was only part of the therapy. The scarcity of data 
makes it difficult to ascertain the beneficial effects of chenodeoxycholic acid in patients with 
Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis. 
The choice of chenodeoxycholic acid dosage was empirically derived for all patients based on the 
normalisation of urine and serum bile acids. No dose response study has been conducted. Hence, it is 
not possible to ascertain whether the proposed dosing regimen is optimal in the target patient 
population. 
The clinical efficacy of CDCA treatment is more difficult to assess than the biochemical efficacy. A 
formal comparison of the long term clinical outcome of patients suffering from CTX with and without 
Assessment report  
EMA/650359/2016  
Page 43/47 
 
 
 
 
 
CDCA treatment would have been desirable. However, due to the rarity of the disease and the fact that 
most of the cases presented were detected at a symptomatic stage of differing severity, a formal study 
would not be feasible. 
It is likely that due to the multiple nature of therapy (dietary, pharmaceutical, supportive) in CTX 
patients, the magnitude of the clinical effects of CDCA treatment may be overestimated. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The adverse effects seen with chenodeoxycholic acid therapy appear to be not serious, reversible and 
mainly related to elevated hepatic enzymes.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
In the absence of controlled trial data, it is difficult to ascertain causality of the unfavourable effects. 
With regards to literature reports, no clear pre-defined observation period on which an incidence 
calculation may be based is available. Information on the number of patients and the total time of 
observation was not available in some cases.

Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Oral CDCA therapy has been shown to restore normal laboratory parameters and significantly improve 
the affected patients’ symptoms. This reflects restoration of an effective feedback control of bile acid 
synthesis and a metabolic equilibrium.  
The overall safety profile of chenodeoxycholic acid has been found to be favourable. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Oral chenodeoxycholic acid appears to be an effective and well tolerated long-term treatment of 
patients with Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis. The use of chenodeoxycholic acid to treat this disease 
condition has been documented in the literature over a period of approximately 40 years. Due to the 
extreme rarity of the disease as well as the specialised knowledge and the tools needed for the 
diagnosis, the number of cases reported in the literature remains limited. However, objectively 
measurable significant improvements in metabolic and clinical parameters have been demonstrated.  
Treatment with chenodeoxycholic acid at appropriate doses produced no significant adverse events, as 
reported consistently in the literature and retrospective clinical trials.   
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis is a progressive disease which, if untreated, leads to death from 
neurological damage. Currently there is no causal treatment. Treatment is limited to correcting the 
biochemical abnormalities, including the administration of bile acids and vitamin preparations.  
Although the data submitted is limited as expected in such rare conditions, it is nevertheless 
considered that the clinical information presented in this application is adequate to support the 
demonstration of efficacy and safety of chenodeoxycholic acid in the claimed indication. Taken 
together, the combined evaluation of the submitted retrospective studies and the published literature 
provides a significant, albeit not comprehensive, evidence to support the efficacy and safety of 
chenodeoxycholic acid in patients with Cerebrotendinous Xanthomatosis. 
The CHMP was of the opinion that the applicant was unable to provide comprehensive data on the 
efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use because the indication for which CDCA is intended is 
encountered too rarely. It would be contrary to generally accepted principles of medical ethics to 
Assessment report  
EMA/650359/2016  
Page 45/47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
collect such information as participation in a controlled trial would expose patients to a risk of liver 
failure or even death. A marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances for CDCA is 
acceptable in regards to the fulfilled criteria of rarity of the disease (the indications for which the 
product is intended are so rare that the applicant cannot be reasonably expected to provide 
comprehensive evidence) and medical ethics (it would be contrary to generally accepted principles of 
medical ethics to collect such information). Monitoring of the patients and collection of long-term 
efficacy and safety data will be collected via a patient registry.  
4.  Recommendation 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Chenodeoxycholic acid sigma-tau (chenodeoxycholic 
acid) is not similar to Kolbam (cholic acid) and Orphacol (cholic acid) within the meaning of Article 3 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Chenodeoxycholic acid sigma-tau is favourable in the following 
indication: 
Chenodeoxycholic acid sigma-tau is indicated for the treatment of inborn errors of primary bile acid 
synthesis due to sterol 27 hydroxylase deficiency (presenting as cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis 
(CTX)) in infants, children and adolescents aged 1 month to 18 years and adults.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

31-10-272:  A  phase  3  multicentre,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-
controlled  study,  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  flexible-dose  QW 
oral aripiprazole in children and adolescents with TD 
Description 
This was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to assess 
the safety and efficacy of flexible-dose oral aripiprazole QW tablets in children and adolescents 7 to 17 
years of age at screening (the time at which they sign the informed consent) with TD. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The  primary  objective  of  the  trial  was  to  compare  the  efficacy  of  aripiprazole  with  placebo  in  the 
suppression of tics in children and adolescents (7 to 17 years) with a diagnosis of Tourette’s disorder 
(TD).  The  primary  efficacy  measure  was  change  from  baseline to endpoint  (Week  8)  on  the  Total  Tic 
Score (TTS) of the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS). 
The  secondary  objective was  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  aripiprazole  once-weekly  (QW) 
treatment  with  oral  tablets  in  children  and  adolescents  with  a  diagnosis  of  TD.  Secondary  efficacy 
measures included Clinical Global Impression Scale for Tourette’s Syndrome (CGI-TS) and Gilles de la 
Tourette Syndrome - Quality of Life Scale (GTS-QOL). 
Study design 
A  phase  3,  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  trial  designed  to  assess  the 
safety  and  efficacy  of  flexible-dose  oral  aripiprazole  QW  tablets  in  children  and  adolescents  7  to  17 
years of age at screening (the time at which they sign the informed consent) with TD. A total of 126 
subjects were planned to be randomly assigned to either aripiprazole QW or placebo QW in a 2:1 ratio 
(84 subjects in the aripiprazole group and 42 subjects in the placebo group) at approximately 45 sites 
globally.  The  trial  consisted  of  2  distinct  phases:  a  pretreatment  phase  and  a  treatment  phase.  The 
pretreatment  phase  consisted  of  a  Screening  period,  a  washout  period  (when  applicable),  and  a 
Baseline visit. This was followed by an 8-week treatment phase. There was also a follow-up period (30 
± 3 days) for those subjects who did not roll over into the open-label trial. 
The pretreatment phase served the following purposes: 
1) To allow for appropriate washout of prohibited medications 
2) To ensure subject met inclusion/exclusion criteria 
3) To establish a pretreatment baseline of outcome measures 
Modifications to a subject’s pre-existing treatment were not allowed for the explicit purpose of entering 
this  trial,  but  could  be  done  only  when  deemed  clinically  appropriate  by  the  investigator.  Tapering 
rates  for  washout  medications  were  at  the  discretion  of  the  investigator  and  determined  on  an 
individual  basis,  with  consideration  to  the  subject’s  clinical  condition,  dose,  and  known 
pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of  the  medication  being  tapered,  as  long  as  the  protocol-mandated 
discontinuation  timeframe  was  met.  The  exception  was  a  long-acting  depot  medication,  which  could 
not be tapered and had to be discontinued after the informed consent/assent was obtained. Subjects 
visited  the  clinic  at  Weeks  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  and  8  (±  1  day),  at  which  time  the  efficacy,  safety,  and 
outcome measures were collected. A telephone call to the subject to confirm safety and tolerability was

made  at  the  conclusion  of  Week  7,  when  a  clinic  visit  was  not  required.  Subjects  who  met  the 
Diagnostic  and  Statistical  Manual  of  Mental  Disorders,  Fourth  Edition  -  Text  Revision  (DSM-IV-TR) 
diagnostic  criteria  for  TD,  as  confirmed  by  the  Kiddie  Schedule  for  Affective  Disorders  and 
Schizophrenia  -  Present  and  Lifetime  Version  (K-SADS-PL),  including  the  Diagnostic  Supplement  5 
(Substance  Abuse  and  Other  Diseases,  ie,  Tic  Disorders),  and  who  had  a  TTS  ≥  20  on  the  YGTSS  at 
screening and baseline (randomization) could enter into the trial, once the other inclusion criteria were 
satisfied and no exclusion criteria had been met. Furthermore, the subject, a designated caregiver, and 
the investigator had to all agree that the presenting tic symptoms caused impairment in the subject’s 
normal  routines,  based  on  academic  achievement,  occupational  functioning,  social  activities,  and/or 
relationships. 
Subjects  were  randomized  to  either  aripiprazole  QW  or  placebo  QW.  All  subjects  randomized  to 
aripiprazole  began  on  a  52.5  mg  QW  dose  on  Day  0.  At  the  Week  1  visit,  according  to  the 
investigator’s discretion based on efficacy and tolerability, the dose of aripiprazole could remain at 52.5 
mg  QW  or  be  increased  to  77.5  mg  QW.  The  dose  could  be  increased  to  110  mg  QW  for  efficacy  as 
early as Week 2. For the remainder of the trial, the dose could be adjusted up and down among these 
3 dose levels, as determined by investigator discretion. General dosing rules included the following: 
1)  all  dose  increases  should  occur  at  the  time  of  weekly  trial  visits  and  2)  all  dose  increases  or 
decreases  had  to  be  incremental,  that  is,  increase  to  the  next  higher  dose  or  decrease  to  the  next 
lower dose. 
Study population /Sample size 
126  subjects  were  planned  for  randomization  (84  subjects  in  the  aripiprazole  QW  group  and  42 
subjects  in  the  placebo  QW  group)  in  this  trial  from  an  estimated  45  sites  worldwide.  A  total  of  152 
unique subjects were screened for the trial and 135 randomized (90 subjects were in the aripiprazole 
QW group and 45 subjects were in the placebo QW group). The enrollment distribution of randomized 
subjects  across  the  6  countries  was  as  follows:  United  States  (42  subjects),  Canada  (23  subjects), 
Taiwan (22 subjects), South Korea (17 subjects), Mexico (17 subjects) and Hungary (14 subjects). 
This trial enrolled subjects who met the DSM-IV-TR diagnostic criteria for TD, as confirmed by the K-
SADS-PL,  including  the  Diagnostic  Supplement  5  (Substance  Abuse  and  Other  Diseases,  ie,  Tic 
Disorders), and who had a TTS ≥ 20 on the YGTSS at screening and baseline (randomization), and met 
the other inclusion criteria. 
Treatments 
Subjects  were  randomised  in  a  2:1  ratio  to  receive  8  weeks  double-blind  treatment  with  either 
aripiprazole QW ECER tablets 52.5 mg to 110 mg or matching placebo. QW ECER oral aripiprazole or 
matching  placebo  was  administered  every  7  days  beginning  on  Day  0  of  the  trial.  Doses  were  to  be 
taken  on  the  same  day  each  week  (+-1  day),  without  regard  to  meals.  Subjects  randomised  to 
aripiprazole  began  on  a  52.5  mg  QW  ECER  dose  on  Day  0.  At  the  Week  1  visit,  according  to  the 
investigator’s  discretion  based  on  efficacy  and  tolerability,  the  dose  of  aripiprazole  remained  at  52.5 
mg  QW  ECER  or  was  increased  to  77.5  mg  ECER  QW.  The  dose  could  be  increased  to  110  mg  QW 
ECERfor  efficacy  as  early  as  Week  2.  For  the  remainder  of  the  trial,  the  dose  was  adjusted  up  and 
down among the 3 dose levels, as determined by investigator discretion. General dosing rules included 
the  following:  1)  all  dose  increases  should  have  occurred  at  the  time  of  weekly  trial  visits  and  2)  all 
dose  increases  or  decreases  had  to  be  incremental,  that  is,  increased  to  the  next  higher  dose  or 
decreased  to  the  next  lower  dose.  Subjects  who  could  not  tolerate  the  lowest  titration  dose  were 
discontinued  from  the  trial.  Of  note,  according  to  the  protocol,  subjects  were  allowed  to  discontinue

due  to  lack  of  efficacy  beginning  at  Week  5.  There  was  a  follow-up  period  (30  +-3  days)  for  those 
subjects  who  did  not  roll-over  into  the  open-label  trial  (Trial  31-10-274).  An  independent  data 
monitoring  committee  (IDMC)  reviewed  and  evaluated  cumulative  safety  data  collected  at  regular 
intervals to ensure the safety of subjects enrolled in the trial. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  change  from  baseline  to  Week  8  in  YGTSS  TTS.  The  key 
secondary efficacy endpoints were the CGI-TS change score at endpoint (change score obtained from 
CGI-TS improvement scale assessment) and the mean changes from baseline to endpoint in Gilles de 
la  Tourette  -  Quality  of  Life  Scale  (GTS-QOL)  overall  score.  The  other  efficacy  endpoints  were  mean 
change  from  baseline  to  endpoint  in  YGTSS  Total  score,  mean  change  from  baseline  to  endpoint  in 
Clinical  Global  Impression  Scale  for  Tourette’s  Syndrome  (CGI-TS)  Severity  score,  response  rates 
(clinical response was defined as  > 25% improvement from baseline to endpoint in YGTSS TTS OR a 
CGI-TS  change  score  of  1  [very  much  improved]  or  2  [much  improved]  at  endpoint)  and  treatment 
discontinuation rates. 
Statistical Methods 
Assuming 5% of the subjects might drop out of the trial without a postbaseline efficacy evaluation, a 
total  of  126  subjects,  randomized  in  a  2:1  ratio  (84  subjects  to  aripiprazole  QW  and  42  subjects  to 
placebo QW), were needed to provide 85% power at an alpha level of 5% (2-sided) in order to detect a 
treatment  difference  of  −5  (aripiprazole  -  placebo)  in  the  primary  outcome  with  a  common  standard 
deviation  (SD)  of  8.5.  The  difference  of  −5  was  considered  a  clinically  important  difference  in  the 
treatment of TD.  The  SD  of 8.5 was assumed on the basis of reported treatment effects of oral daily 
aripiprazole  on  TD.  A  trial  of  oral,  once-daily  aripiprazole  observed  an  SD  of  8.96  for  change  from 
baseline in TTS (Otsuka protocol 031-KOA-0703). 
The  Intention-to-Treat  (ITT)  Sample  was  composed  of  all  subjects  randomized  to  double-blind 
treatment  (regardless  of  whether  or  not  they  received  treatment).  The  modified  intention-to-treat 
Sample  (mITT)  included  all  subjects  randomly  assigned  to  the  double-blind  treatment,  with  the 
exclusion  of  subjects  randomized  at  sites  002  and  005.  These  two  centers  were  terminated  from 
conducting this trial due to their failure to abide by Good Clinical Practice Guidelines and the protocol 
requirements. The mITT Sample was used in place of the ITT sample, which was the primary dataset 
for all efficacy endpoints, and was analyzed according to the treatment group to which subjects were 
randomized.  The  Safety  Sample  comprised  all  subjects  who  were  randomized  to  double-blind 
treatment  and  received  at  least  1  dose  of  double-blind  trial  drug.  This  was  the  primary  dataset  for 
evaluating safety of subjects according to the actual treatments they received. 
The primary efficacy analysis was the change from baseline to endpoint (Week 8) in YGTSS TTS. The 
analysis  was  performed  using  a  mixed  model  repeated  measures  (MMRM)  linear  model  with  terms  of 
treatment  and  visit  week  as  factors,  baseline  YGTSS  TTS  as  a  covariate,  and  treatment-by-week 
interactions in the model. Visit week was the time variable for repeated measures. To assess the time 
trend  of  treatment  effect,  statistical  analyses  were  also  performed  for  the  change  from  baseline  in 
YGTSS TTS at each visit. 
Key  secondary  and  other  efficacy  endpoints,  in  the  form  of  mean  change  from  baseline,  were 
compared  between  the  aripiprazole  and  placebo  groups  using  a  similar  method,  as  described  for  the 
primary efficacy analysis. Proportion endpoints, such as response rates and treatment discontinuation 
rates,  were  summarized  by  descriptive  statistics  (frequency  and  percent)  and  compared  between  the 
aripiprazole and placebo groups by the Chi-square test.

Sensitivity  analyses  of  the  primary  endpoint  and  key  secondary  endpoint  were  performed  under  the 
assumption  that  the  mechanism  of  missing  data  was  missing  not  at  random.  The  type  I  error  of 
multiple  hypothesis  testing  for  the  primary  and  key  secondary  endpoints  was  controlled  using  a  p-
value  based  fixed-sequence  testing  procedure  in  the  order  of  YGTSS  TTS,  CGI-TS,  and  GTS-QOL,  ie, 
one must reject the null hypothesis of an endpoint at the level of 0.05 (2-sided) to test the hypothesis 
of the subsequent endpoint in the sequence at the level of 0.05 (2-sided). 
Safety endpoints were summarized by descriptive statistics using the safety sample. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Of the 135 subjects randomised in the trial, 90 subjects were enrolled in the aripiprazole group and 45 
subjects  were  enrolled  in  the  placebo  group.  A  total  of  113  subjects  (83.7%)  completed  the  trial,  78 
(86.7%) in the aripiprazole group and 35 (77.8%) in the placebo group. Based on the ITT Sample (N = 
135),  22  subjects  (16.3%)  discontinued  from  the  trial,  12  (13.3%)  in  the  aripiprazole  group  and  10 
(22.2%)  in  the  placebo  group;  7  subjects  (5.2%)  discontinued  due  to  an  AE,  5  (5.6%)  in  the 
aripiprazole  group  and  2  (4.4%)  in  the  placebo  group;  3  subjects  (2.2%)  discontinued  due  to 
withdrawal of consent, 1 (1.1%) in the aripiprazole group and 2 (4.4%) in the placebo group; and 12 
(8.9%) subjects discontinued from the trial due to lack of efficacy, 6 (6.7%) in the aripiprazole group 
and  6  (13.3%)  in  the  placebo  group..  Based  on  the  mITT  Sample  (N  =  124),  22  subjects  (17.7%) 
discontinued from the trial, 12 (14.6%) in the aripiprazole group and 10 (23.8%) in the placebo group; 
7 subjects (5.6%) discontinued due to an AE, 5 (6.1%) in the aripiprazole group and 2 (4.8%) in the 
placebo  group;  3  subjects  (2.4%)  discontinued  due  to  withdrawal  of  consent,  1  in  the  aripiprazole 
group (1.2%) and 2 (4.8%) in the placebo group; and 12 subjects (9.7%) discontinued from the trial 
due  to  lack  of  efficacy,  6  (7.3%)  in  the  aripiprazole  group  and  6  (14.3%)  in  the  placebo  group.  The 
number of male and female subjects in the mITT population was balanced, the mean age at trial entry 
was 11.8 years (range 7 to 17 years) and the majority of subjects were Caucasian (84/124, 67.7%). 
Overall,  the  baseline  demographic  characteristics,  including  baseline  disease  status  were  similar 
between  the  aripiprazole  and  placebo  groups  for  the  mITT  population.  The  study  protocol  allowed 
patients to withdraw after 5 weeks of placebo-controlled treatment. 
Baseline data 
The mean age of randomized subjects was 12.0 and 11.5 years in the aripiprazole and placebo groups, 
respectively.  Most  subjects  were  white:  64.6%  and  73.8%  in  the  aripiprazole  and  placebo  groups, 
respectively. The mITT Sample included a higher percentage of males than females in the aripiprazole 
and  placebo  groups:  80.5%  and  66.7%,  respectively,  as  expected  due  to  the  higher  incidence  of  the 
disease  in  males.  The  mean  weight  and  BMI  of  subjects  in  the  mITT  Sample  were  51.3  kg  and  20.7 
kg/m2 and 49.2 kg and 20.7 kg/m2, respectively, in the aripiprazole and placebo groups. The baseline 
mean total YGTSS of subjects in the mITT Sample was 29.9 and 28.9 in the aripiprazole and placebo 
groups, respectively. 
Efficacy results 
Of the 83 subjects randomied in the trial, 20 subjects were enrolled in the aripiprazole 52.5 mg group 
and  21subjects  were  enrolled  to  each  of  the  aripiprazole  77.5  mg,  aripiprazole  110  mg  and  placebo 
groups.  A  total  of  68  (81.9%)  subjects  completed  the  trial.  The  most  frequent  reason  for 
discontinuation  was  sponsor  discontinued  the  trial  (6  of  83  [7.2%]  subjects).  The  other  main  reason 
for  discontinuation  from  the  trial  was  subject  withdrawing  consent  (4  of  83  [4.8%]  subjects).  The

mean  age  of  subjects  was  11.9  years  with  a  mean  time  since  first  diagnosis  of  2.7  years.  In  all 
treatment groups, slightly more subjects in the 7- to 12-year age group (48 of 83 [57.8%] subjects) 
were randomised compared to the 13- to 17-year age group (35 of 83 [42.2%] subjects). The mean 
BMI  was  20.0  kg/m2;  the  mean  weight  and  height  were  47.9  kg  and  152.4  cm,  respectively.  The 
majority of subjects were white (69 of 83 [83.1%] subjects overall) and non-Hispanic or Latino (78 of 
83  [94.0%]  subjects  overall).  More  black  or  African  American  subjects  were  randomised  in  the 
aripiprazole QW ECER 52.5 mg group compared to the other treatment arms. 
Since  the  trial  was  discontinued  by  the  sponsor  with  a  much  smaller  sample  size  than  originally 
planned,  no  inferential  analyses  were  carried  out  and  instead  descriptive  statistics  were  used  to 
summarise all efficacy data, therefore, the data should be interpreted with caution. 
Primary endpoint 
No meaningful difference in the changes from baseline to Week 8 between treatment groups were was 
observed in YGTSS TTS in the ITT Sample in the OC and LOCF datasets. The aripiprazole QW ECER 110 
mg group showed the largest decrease from baseline. The mean change from baseline in the placebo 
group was similar to the aripiprazole QW ECER 52.5 mg and 77.5 mg groups. 
Secondary endpoints 
The CGI-TS change score at Week 8 were was similar between the placebo group and the aripiprazole 
QW ECER 52.5 mg, and 77.5 mg groups, for the OC and LOCF datasets. No meaningful differences in 
mean  change  from  baseline  were  observed  in  the  GTS-QOL  Overall  Score,  for  the  OC  and  LOCF 
datasets; however, the aripiprazole QW ECER 77.5 mg showed the least improvement and the placebo 
group showed the same improvement as the aripiprazole QW ECER 110 mg group. 
Other efficacy endpoints 
No  meaningful  differences  in  mean  change  from  baseline  in  the  Total  YGTSS  Score,  and  CGI-TS 
Severity Score were observed between treatment groups for the OC and LOCF datasets. The placebo 
group showed a similar decrease from baseline improvement to the aripiprazole QW ECER 52.5 mg and 
77.5  mg  groups.  The  CGI-TS  Severity  Score  showed  similar  decrease  from  baseline  in  all  treatment 
groups. 
Safety results 
Rates of AEs, SAEs, and Discontinuation of Therapy 
90 subjects were exposed to aripiprazole in this trial, receiving an average dose of 75.3 mg QW. In the 
aripiprazole group, 87.8% (79/90) of subjects were exposed to aripiprazole for > 7 weeks. The overall 
incidence of TEAEs was 66.7% in the aripiprazole group and 60.0% in the placebo group. Aripiprazole 
was generally safe and well tolerated by the subjects in this study. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs that occurred in the aripiprazole group (with an incidence >=5%) 
were somnolence (16.7% in the aripiprazole group and 6.7% in the placebo group), headache (13.3% 
in  the  aripiprazole  group  and  4.4%),  nausea  (13.3%  in  the  aripiprazole  group  and  8.9%),  vomiting 
(10.0%  in  the  aripiprazole  group  and  2.2%),  fatigue  (8.9%  in  the  aripiprazole  group  and  0%),  and 
increased appetite (6.7% in the aripiprazole group and 2.2%). These TEAEs occurred more frequently 
in the aripiprazole group than in the placebo group. The most frequently reported TEAE in the placebo 
group was nasopharyngitis (15.6%), which occurred less frequently in the aripiprazole group (3.3%). 
Most TEAEs were mild or moderate in intensity. Severe TEAEs reported in the aripiprazole group were 
dystonia in 2 subjects (2.2%) and the following TEAEs in 1 subject (1.1%) each: ALT increased, AST

increased, blood creatine phosphokinase increased, hyperthermia, musculoskeletal stiffness, tonsillitis, 
and somnolence. No severe TEAEs were reported in the placebo group. 
For  the  most  common  TEAEs  (with  an  incidence  of  ≥  5%  in  any  aripiprazole  group  and ≥  2  times  the 
incidence  in  the  placebo  group),  the  Breslow-Day  test  of  significance  for  homogeneity  was  used  to 
assess the odds ratio difference for age, sex, and race subgroups between the aripiprazole and placebo 
groups.  Results  of  the  Breslow-Day  Test  showed  no  statistically  significant  difference  between  age, 
sex, or race subgroups for the most common TEAEs for the aripiprazole versus placebo groups. TEAEs 
considered by the investigator as potentially causally related to the IMP were reported for 40 (44.4%) 
and  12  (26.7%)  subjects  in  the  aripiprazole  and  placebo  groups,  respectively.  The  most  frequently 
reported  (experienced  by  >=5%  of  subjects  in  the  aripiprazole  group)  TEAEs  considered  by  the 
investigator as potentially causally related to the IMP were somnolence (15 subjects [16.7%]), nausea, 
(12  subjects  [13.3%]),  fatigue  (8  subjects  [8.9%]),  headache  (7  subjects  [7.8%]),  and  increased 
appetite and vomiting (6 subjects each [6.7%]). In the placebo group, causally related TEAEs reported 
in  more  than  1  subject  each  were  nausea  (4  subjects  [8.9%])  and  somnolence  (3  subjects  [6.7%]). 
Most  TEAEs  considered  by  the  investigator  as  potentially  causally  related  to  the  IMP  were  mild  or 
moderate  in  intensity  in  both  treatment  groups.  Severe  TEAEs  considered  by  the  investigator  as 
potentially  causally  related  to  the  IMP  reported  in  the  aripiprazole  group  were  dystonia  in  2  subjects 
(2.2%);  ALT  increased,  AST  increased,  and  blood  creatinine  phosphokinase  increased  in  1  subject 
(1.1%);  hyperthermia,  musculoskeletal  stiffness,  and  somnolence  in  1  subject  (1.1%)  each.  No 
subjects in the placebo group had severe potentially causally related TEAE. 
Serious adverse events were reported for 3 subjects (3.3%) in the aripiprazole group and no subjects 
in the placebo group. One (1) aripiprazole subject had severe dystonia and severe hyperthermia, both 
of  which  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  definitely  related  to  the  IMP.  The  second  subject 
had  severe  dystonia  and  moderate  intensity  prolonged  QTcB,  both  of  which  were  considered  by  the 
investigator to be probably related to the IMP. The third subject had severe increases in ALT, AST, and 
creatine phosphokinase (CPK), all of which were considered by the investigator to be probably related 
to  the  IMP.  In  all  cases,  IMP  was  discontinued,  and  the  subjects  recovered.  5  subjects  (5.6%) in  the 
aripiprazole  group  and  2  subjects  (4.4%)  in  the  placebo  group  discontinued  IMP  due  to  TEAEs.  The 
system  organ  class  of  investigations  had  the  most  subjects  with  TEAEs  leading  to  discontinuation  (3 
subjects [3.3%] in the aripiprazole group and 2 subjects [4.4%] in the placebo group). Only 2 TEAEs 
led to discontinuation of > 1 subject: ECG QT prolonged, which was experienced by 2 subjects in each 
treatment group, and dystonia, which was experienced by 2 subjects in the aripiprazole group. 
No  deaths  occurred  during  the  trial.  No  overdose-related  TEAEs  and  no  pregnancies  were  reported 
during the trial. 
With  regards  to  TEAEs  of  special  interest,  treatment-emergent  AEs  related  to  Extrapyramidal 
symptoms (EPS) were experienced by 6 subjects (6.7%) in the aripiprazole group and no subjects in 
the placebo group. The most frequently reported EPS-related TEAE was dystonia (3 subjects [3.3%]), 
2  of  which  were  severe  and  reported  as  SAEs.  Other  EPS-related  TEAEs  reported  in  the  aripiprazole 
group were muscle spasms, dyskinesia, and tremor in 1 subject (1.1%) each, all of which were of mild 
intensity. All of the EPS-related TEAEs started during the first 6 days of treatment, except the muscle 
spasms, which occurred on Day 15. 
With  regards  to  Extrapyramidal  Symptoms  (EPS),  The  treatment  difference  between  the  aripiprazole 
and  placebo  groups  in  the  Simpson-Angus  Scale  (SAS)  total  score  (0.04),  Abnormal  Involuntary 
Movement  Scale  (AIMS)  score  (-0.32)  and  Barnes  Akathisia  Rating  Scale  (BARS)  score  ((-0.05)  were 
not statistically significant at Week 8, based on a mixed effect repeated measure model. Similar results 
were  seen  for  the  analyses  using  the  ANCOVA  with  OC  and  ANCOVA  with  LOCF.  No  post-baseline 
suicidal behaviour or ideation was observed based on results of reported.

Of  the  safety  rating  scales,  Swanson,  Nolan,  and  Pelham-IV  (SNAP-IV),  Children’s  Yale-  Brown 
Obsessive  Compulsive  Scale  (CY-BOCS),  Children’s  Depression  Rating  Scale -  Revised  (CDRS-R),  and 
Paediatric  Anxiety  Rating  Scale  (PARS),  no  statistically  significant  difference  in  the  change  from 
baseline to Week 8 was observed between the aripiprazole and placebo groups, except on the SNAP-
IV,  where  aripiprazole  showed  significant  improvement  over  placebo  in  the  hyperactivity/impulsivity 
average score (p = 0.0328) and the average score of the ADD/ADHD subscale (p = 0.0220). 
Laboratory Assessments, Vital Signs, ECG 
No mean changes from baseline for any of the serum chemistry laboratory, haematology, or urinalysis 
tests  were  considered  to  be  clinically  significant.  No  significant  findings  were  shown  in  clinical 
laboratory  values,  vital  signs,  physical  examinations,  and  ECG  parameters.  The  mean  (+-SD)  change 
from baseline to the last visit in the prolactin test results for the aripiprazole group males (-4.31 [+-
5.81]  ng/mL)  and  females  (-5.58  [+-7.20]  ng/mL)  was  greater  than  for  the  placebo  group  males  (-
1.69 [+-8.58] ng/mL) and females (2.06 [+-6.02] ng/mL). No subjects had prolactin values >2 x ULN. 
These changes are consistent with prolactin data for aripiprazole in other paediatric trials. 
Laboratory Measurements of Special Interest 
Weight  gain-related  TEAEs  in  the  aripiprazole  and  placebo  groups  were  reported  for  8  (8.9%)  and  1 
(2.2%)  subjects,  respectively.  Increased  appetite  was  the  most  frequently  reported  weight-gain 
related  TEAE,  occurring  in  6  (6.7%)  subjects  in  the  aripiprazole  group  and  1  (2.2%)  subject  in  the 
placebo group. One of these subjects in the aripiprazole group also had a TEAE of weight increased. In 
addition, in the aripiprazole group, 1 other subject had a TEAE of weight increased (total of 2 subjects 
[2.2%]) and 1 subject (1.1%) had hyperphagia. All of these events were of mild or moderate intensity 
and  began  between  Days  1  and  29.  As  summarised  in,  the  7  subjects  in  the  aripiprazole  group  who 
had  a  potentially  clinically  relevant  weight  gain  >=7%  at  Week  8  had  low  BMI  (<  20  kg/m2)  at 
baseline. 
No  prolactin-related  TEAEs,  hyperglycaemia-related  or  diabetes-related  TEAEs  were  reported  during 
the trial. One subject in the aripiprazole group had a lipid parameterrelated TEAE of mild dyslipidaemia 
starting on Day 43. No other lipid parameter-related TEAEs were reported during the trial. 
31-10-273:  A  phase  3  multicentre,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-
controlled  study  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  fixed  dose  QW  oral 
aripiprazole in Children and Adolescents with TD  
Description 
This was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to assess 
the safety and efficacy of flexible-dose oral aripiprazole QW tablets in children and adolescents 7 to 17 
years of age at screening (the time at which they sign the informed consent) with TD. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary:  The  primary  objective  was  to  compare  the  efficacy  of  aripiprazole  with  placebo  in  the 
suppression  of  tics  in  children  and  adolescents  (aged  7  to  17  years)  with  a  diagnosis  of  Tourette’s 
Disorder (TD).

Secondary:  The  secondary  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  aripiprazole  once-
weekly (QW) treatment with oral tablets in children and adolescents with a diagnosis of TD. 
Study design 
Trial  31-10-273  was  a  phase  3,  multiple  site,  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  trial 
designed  to  assess  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  fixed-dose  oral  aripiprazole  QW  tablets  in  children  and 
adolescents,  7  to  17  years  of  age  at  screening  (the  time  at  which  they  signed  the  informed 
consent/assent), with TD. 
A total of 192 subjects were planned to be randomly assigned to receive one of 3 doses of aripiprazole 
QW (52.5, 77.5, and 110  mg) or placebo in a 1:1:1:1 ratio (48 subjects each in the aripiprazole QW 
52.5,  77.5,  and  110  mg  groups  and  48  subjects  in  the  placebo  group)  at  approximately  55  sites 
globally.  The  trial  consisted  of  2  distinct  phases:  a  pretreatment  phase  and  a  treatment  phase.  The 
pretreatment  phase  consisted  of  a  screening  period,  a  washout  period  (when  applicable),  and  a 
baseline visit. This was followed by an 8-week treatment phase. There was also a follow-up period (30 
+- 3 days) for those subjects who did not roll-over into the open-label trial. 
The pretreatment phase served the following purposes: 
• 
• 
• 
To allow for appropriate washout of prohibited medications 
To ensure the subject met the inclusion/exclusion criteria 
To establish a pretreatment baseline of outcome measures 
Modifications  to  a  subject’s  pre-existing  treatment  were  not  to  be  made  for  the  explicit  purpose  of 
entering this trial, but were done only when deemed clinically appropriate by the investigator. Tapering 
rates for washout medications were at the discretion of the investigator and were to be determined on 
an  individual  basis,  with  consideration  to  the  subject’s  clinical  condition,  dose,  and  known 
pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of  the  medication  being  tapered,  as  long  as  the  protocol-mandated 
discontinuation timeframe was met. The exception was a long acting depot medication, which could not 
have been tapered and would have been discontinued after the informed consent/assent was obtained. 
All psychotropic medications must have been discontinued for at least 2 weeks (14 days) prior to the 
baseline visit, with the exception of psychostimulant medications such as methylphenidate (not limited 
to  Concerta®,  Metadate  CR®,  Ritalin  LA®,  Focalin®,  Focalin  XR®,  Vyvanse®)  prescribed  for  the 
treatment  of  symptoms  of  attention-deficit  disorder/attention-deficit  hyperactivity  disorder 
(ADD/ADHD),  which  were  permitted  during  the  trial.  Use  of  psychostimulant  medications  was  only 
permitted if the subject did not develop and/or did not have an exacerbation of the tic disorder after 
the initiation of treatment with the psychostimulant. In addition, the dose of any psychostimulant must 
have  been  stable  for  at  least  4  weeks  prior  to  screening.  All  selective  serotonin  reuptake 
inhibitors/selective  norepinephrine  reuptake  inhibitors  must  have  been  discontinued  at  least  4  weeks 
(28  days)  prior  to  the  baseline  visit.  In  addition,  long-acting  (depot)  neuroleptics  must  have  been 
discontinued for at least one full cycle plus 2 weeks prior to the baseline visit. Clonidine, guanfacine, 
guanabenz,  atomoxetine,  and  carbamazepine  were  prohibited  during  the  trial  and  must  have  been 
discontinued  for  at  least  2  weeks  prior  to  baseline.  Subjects  must  have  discontinued  aripiprazole 
treatment  at  least  30  days  prior  to  the  screening  visit.  Subjects  not  in  need  of  medication  washout 
proceeded to the trial baseline visit after the inclusion/exclusion criteria were met. 
Subjects visited the clinic at Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 8 (+- 1 day), at which time efficacy, safety, 
and outcome measures were collected. A telephone call to the subject to confirm safety and tolerability 
was made at the conclusion of Week 7, when the clinic visit was not scheduled. Subjects who met the

diagnostic  criteria  for  TD,  as  confirmed  by  the  Kiddie  Schedule  for  Affective  Disorders  and 
Schizophrenia  -  Present  and  Lifetime  Version  (K-SADS-PL),  including  the  Diagnostic  Supplement  5 
(Substance Abuse and Other Diseases, ie, Tic Disorders), and who had a Total Tic Score (TTS) >= 20 
on  the  Yale  Global  Tic  Severity  Scale  (YGTSS)  at  screening  and  baseline  (randomization),  could  have 
entered into the trial once the other inclusion criteria were satisfied and no exclusion criteria were met. 
Furthermore, the subject,  a designated caregiver, and the investigator must have all agreed that the 
presenting  tic  symptoms  caused  impairment  in  the  subject’s  normal  routines,  based  on  academic 
achievement,  occupational 
functioning,  social  activities,  and/or  relationships.  Subjects  were 
randomized  to  receive  either  aripiprazole  or  placebo.  All  subjects  randomized  to  one  of  the  3 
aripiprazole  treatment  groups  began  a  52.5-mg  dose  on  Day  0  with  the  dose  titrated  to  achieve  the 
randomized dose at Day 0 for the 52.5 mg group, Week 1 for the 77.5 mg group, and Week 2 for the 
110 mg group. Once subjects reached the randomized dose, they were to remain on the randomized 
dose for the duration of the treatment period. The titration schedule must have been adhered to with 
no dose decreases allowed at any time. Subjects not tolerating any dose were to be discontinued from 
the trial. 
Study population /Sample size 
A  total  of  192  subjects  were  planned  to  be  randomly  assigned  in  the  trial.  Overall,  83  subjects  were 
randomized in the trial and treated: 20 subjects in the aripiprazole QW 52.5 mg group, 21 subjects in 
the aripiprazole QW 77.5 mg group, 21 subjects in the aripiprazole QW 110 mg group, and 21 subjects 
in  the  placebo  group.  A  total  of  68  subjects  completed  the  trial:  17  subjects  in  the  aripiprazole  QW 
52.5 mg group, 17 subjects in the aripiprazole QW 77.5 mg group, 16 subjects in the aripiprazole QW 
110 mg group, and 18 subjects in the placebo group. A total of 83 subjects were analyzed for safety 
and efficacy. 
The key inclusion criteria were as follows: 
1) The subject was a male or female child or adolescent, 7 to 17 years of age (inclusive) at the time of 
signing the informed consent/assent. 
2)  The  subject  met  current  DSM-IV-TR  diagnostic  criteria  for  TD,  as  confirmed  by  the  K-SADS-PL, 
including the Diagnostic Supplement 5 (Substance Abuse and Other Diseases, ie, Tic Disorders). 
3) The subject had a TTS >= 20 on the YGTSS at screening and baseline (randomization). 
4)  The  subject,  a  caregiver,  and  the  investigator  all agreed  that  the  presenting  tic  symptoms  caused 
impairment  in  the  subject's  normal  routines,  which  included  academic  achievement,  occupational 
functioning, social activities, and/or relationships. 
Treatments 
Subjects were randomised in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to receive 8 weeks double-blind treatment with one of the 
3  doses  of  QW  ECER  aripiprazole  (52.5  mg,  77.5  or  110  mg)  or  a  matching  placebo.  QW  oral 
aripiprazole or matching placebo was administered every 7 days beginning on Day 0 of the trial. Doses 
were taken on the same day each week (+-1 day), without regard to meals. All subjects’ randomised 
to one of the 3 aripiprazole treatment groups began on a 52.5-mg dose on Day 0 with the dose titrated 
to achieve the randomized dose at Day 0 for the 52.5 mg group, Week 1 for the 77.5 mg group, and 
Week 2 for the 110 mg group. Once the subject reached the randomised dose, they remained on this 
dose  for  the  duration  of  the  treatment  period.  The  titration  schedule  was  adhered  to  with  no  dose 
decreases  allowed  at  any  time.  Subjects  not  tolerating  any  dose  were  discontinued.  There  was  a

follow-up period (30 +- 3 days) for those subjects who did not roll-over into the open-label trial (Trial 
31-10-274). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy: The primary efficacy endpoint was the change from baseline to endpoint (Week 8) in YGTSS 
TTS. 
The key secondary endpoints included the following: 
•  Mean  CGI-TS  Change  score  at  endpoint  (change  score  obtained  from  CGI-TS  improvement 
scale assessment) 
•  Mean changes from baseline to endpoint in GTS-QOL overall score 
The other efficacy endpoints included: 
•  Mean change from baseline to endpoint in Total YGTSS score 
•  Mean change from baseline to endpoint in CGI-TS Severity score 
•  Response  rates  (clinical  response  was  defined  as  a  >  25%  improvement  from  baseline  to 
endpoint  in  YGTSS  TTS  OR  a  CGI-TS  Change  score  of  1  [very  much  improved]  or  2  [much 
improved] at endpoint) 
• 
Treatment discontinuation rates 
Pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics: Blood samples were collected during Weeks 6 and 8 and plasma 
concentrations  of  aripiprazole  and  its  metabolite,  dehydro-aripiprazole,  were  assessed.  If  possible, 
exploratory population and PK/pharmacodynamic modeling was to be performed. 
Safety: Safety endpoints included the following: 
•  AEs 
• 
Laboratory tests (hematology, serum chemistry [including prolactin, glycosylated hemoglobin, 
and TSH], urinalysis, and pregnancy tests) 
•  Vital signs

•  BARS 
•  SAS 
•  C-SSRS 
•  ADD/ADHD Subscale of SNAP-IV 
•  CY-BOCS 
•  CDRS-R 
• 
PARS 
•  Body weight

•  BMI 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic/pharmacogenomics 
Plasma concentrations of aripiprazole and its metabolite, dehydro-aripiprazole, were quantitated using 
a  validated  high-performance  liquid  chromatography  with  tandem  mass  spectrometry  method.  Blood 
samples were collected during the Week 6 and Week 8/Early Termination visits, at the same time when 
safety  laboratory  samples  were  collected.  Plasma  concentrations  of  aripiprazole  and  its  metabolite, 
dehydro-aripiprazole,  were  reported  and  summarized  using  descriptive  statistics.  Results  of 
pharmacogenomic  testing  to  assess  cytochrome  P450  2D6  metabolizer  status  were  also  reported. 
Plasma  concentration  data  were  further  analyzed  as  part  of  a  population  PK  analysis  and 
PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) modeling and reported separately. 
Statistical Methods 
Subject Samples: The  Intent-to-treat (ITT) Sample, which included all subjects randomly assigned to 
the  double-blind  treatment,  was  the  primary  dataset  for  all  efficacy  endpoints  and  was  analyzed 
according to the treatment group to which subjects were randomized. The Safety Sample included all 
subjects  who  were  randomized  to  double-blind  treatment  and  received  at  least  1  dose  of  the 
investigational  medicinal  product  (IMP).  The  Safety  Sample  was  analyzed  according  to  the  treatment 
received.  If  a  subject  randomized  to  placebo  ever  took  an  active  aripiprazole  dose,  the  subject  was 
analyzed  according  to  the  highest  aripiprazole  dose  he  or  she  received.  The  Observed  Case  (OC) 
dataset for the ITT Sample and Safety Sample at the endpoint or at a particular trial week consisted of 
data from subjects in the corresponding sample who had non-missing scores for the efficacy or safety 
variable under analysis at that week. 
Efficacy: Since the actual trial was discontinued by the sponsor, with a much smaller sample size than 
originally planned, changes were made to the efficacy analyses that were pre-specified in the protocol. 
No  inferential  analyses  were  carried  out  and  instead  descriptive  statistics  were  used  to  summarize 
efficacy data of this trial. 
Safety:  In  addition  to  the  analysis  of  standard  safety  parameters,  physical  examination  findings, 
weight,  height,  BMI,  waist  circumference,  EPS,  ADD/ADHD  subscale  of  SNAP-IV,  CY-BOCS,  CDRS-R, 
PARS,  and  suicidality  (C-SSRS)  were  evaluated  through  analysis  of  data  from  appropriate  scales. 
Safety variables were summarized by incidence rates and their changes from baseline, as appropriate. 
In general, summary statistics of changes from baseline were provided for safety variables based on all 
available data (ie, OC dataset) for each postbaseline visit and for the last visit. Data from unscheduled 
visits were used in the mean change from baseline calculations and incidence calculations. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A  total  of  105  unique  subjects  were  screened  and  83  subjects  were  randomized:  Of  the  83  subjects 
randomied  in  the  trial,  20  subjects  were  enrolled  in  the  aripiprazole  52.5  mg  group  and  21subjects 
were enrolled to each of the aripiprazole 77.5 mg, aripiprazole 110 mg and placebo groups. A total of 
68  (81.9%)  subjects  completed  the  trial.  The  most  frequent  reason  for  discontinuation  was  sponsor 
discontinued  the  trial  (6  of  83  [7.2%]  subjects).  The  other  main  reason  for  discontinuation  from  the 
trial was subject withdrawing consent (4 of 83 [4.8%] subjects). The mean age of subjects was 11.9 
years  with  a  mean  time  since  first  diagnosis  of  2.7  years.  In  all  treatment  groups,  slightly  more 
subjects in the 7- to 12-year age group (48 of 83 [57.8%] subjects) were randomised compared to the 
13-  to  17-year  age  group  (35  of  83  [42.2%]  subjects).  The  mean  BMI  was  20.0  kg/m2;  the  mean

weight and height were 47.9 kg and 152.4 cm, respectively. The majority of subjects were white (69 of 
83  [83.1%]  subjects  overall)  and  non-Hispanic  or  Latino  (78  of  83  [94.0%]  subjects  overall).  More 
black  or  African  American  subjects  were  randomised  in  the  aripiprazole  QW  ECER  52.5  mg  group 
compared to the other treatment arms. 
Baseline data 
The trial was terminated early based on the review of the recent data from placebo-controlled Trial 31-
10-272 (aripiprazole QW) relative to the results of the placebo-controlled Trial 31-12-293 (aripiprazole 
once  daily  [QD])  in  subjects  with  TD.  The  aripiprazole  QW  formulation  was  found  to  be  statistically 
superior  to  placebo  in  Trial  31-10-272,  but  the  demonstrated  efficacy  was  not  as  robust  as  that 
observed with the QD formulation. Therefore, the QW formulation will not be pursued for the treatment 
of TD. Importantly, the trial closure was unrelated to any safety issues (no signals or items of concern 
have been identified). 
The  mean  age  of  subjects  was  11.9  years  with  a  mean  time  since  first  diagnosis  of  2.7  years.  The 
majority of subjects were white (69 of 83 [83.1%] subjects overall) and non-Hispanic or Latino (78 of 
83 [94.0%] subjects overall). 
Efficacy results 
As  the  actual  randomized  population  was  much  smaller  than  the  planned  size,  efficacy  was  analyzed 
using  descriptive  statistics  only;  therefore,  data  should  be  interpreted  with  caution.  No  meaningful 
differences in the change from baseline to Week 8 between treatment groups was observed in YGTSS 
TTS in the ITT Sample in the OC and last observation carried forward (LOCF) datasets. 
Change score at Week 8 was similar between the placebo group and the aripiprazole QW 52.5 mg and 
77.5  mg  groups,  for  the  OC  and  LOCF  datasets.  The  change  score  was  the  lowest  in  the  aripiprazole 
QW 110 mg group. No meaningful differences in in mean change from baseline were observed in the 
GTS-QOL Overall Score, Total YGTSS Score, and CGI-TS Severity Score for the OC and LOCF datasets. 
The  highest  rate  of  responders  was  the  aripiprazole  QW  110  mg  group  for  both  the  OC  and  LOCF 
datasets  (13  responders  [81.3%]  and  15  responders  [75.0%],  respectively).  A  total  of  15  of  83 
(18.1%) subjects discontinued the trial. Of the 15 subjects who discontinued from the trial, 9 subjects 
discontinued  for  reasons  other  than  sponsor  discontinued  the  trial.  The  highest  instance  of  treatment 
discontinuation for reasons other than sponsor discontinued the trial was seen in the aripiprazole QW 
52.5  mg  and  QW  110  mg  groups  (3  of  20  [15.0%]  subjects  and  3  of  21  [14.3%]  subjects, 
respectively) and lowest incidence was seen in the placebo group (1 of 21 [4.8%] subjects. 
Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic/pharmacogenomics  Results:  The  PK  samples  collected  in  this  trial 
were analyzed for aripiprazole and dehydro-aripiprazole concentrations and results are reported in the 
bioanalytical report. No further analysis or data summaries were conducted or planned for this trial. 
Safety results 
The aripiprazole QW 110 mg group reported the highest incidence of subjects with treatment-emergent 
adverse  events  (TEAEs)  (17  of  21  [81.0%]  subjects  reported  57  TEAEs).  Similar  incidences  of  TEAEs 
were  reported  in  the  aripiprazole  QW  52.5  mg,  aripiprazole  QW  77.5  mg,  and  placebo  groups.  Most 
TEAEs  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  No  severe  TEAEs  were  reported  in  the  placebo  group 
whereas there were 2 severe TEAEs reported in the aripiprazole QW 77.5 mg group, and 1 severe TEAE 
reported  each  in  the  aripiprazole  QW  52.5  mg  and  aripiprazole  QW  110  mg  groups.  Only  1  subject 
discontinued from the trial due to AEs; this subject was in the aripiprazole QW 77.5 mg group. Fewer

subjects  in  the  placebo  group  reported  TEAEs  potentially  causally  related  to  IMP  than  in  the 
aripiprazole groups. 
No  deaths  or  serious  TEAEs  were  reported  during  the  trial.  EPS-related  TEAEs  were  reported  for  3 
subjects  (tremor  was  reported  in  1  of  20  [5.0%]  subjects  in  the  aripiprazole  QW  52.5  mg  group, 
muscle spasm in 1 of 21 [4.8%] subjects in the aripiprazole QW 110 mg group, and akathisia in 1 of 
21 [4.8%] subjects in the placebo group). Increased weight was reported by 1 of 20 (5.0%) subjects 
in  the  aripiprazole  QW  52.5  mg  group  and  1  of  21  (4.8%)  subjects  in  the  aripiprazole  QW  110  mg 
group.  Increased  appetite  was  reported  in  1  of  21  (4.8%)  subjects  in  the  aripiprazole  QW  77.5  mg 
group. A prolactin-related TEAE of decreased blood prolactin was reported for 1 of 20 (5.0%) subjects 
in  the  aripiprazole  QW  52.5  mg  group.  No  suicide-,  hyperglycemia-,  diabetes-,  lipid  parameter-,  or 
overdose-related  AEs  were  reported  during  the  trial.  No  other  meaningful  findings  were  shown  in 
clinical laboratory values, vital signs, physical examinations, or ECG parameters. 
No  meaningful  differences  in  change  from  baseline  were  observed  in  the  AIMS,  BARS,  SAS,  C-SSRS, 
ADD/ADHD Subscale of SNAP-IV, CY-BOCS, CDRS-R, or PARS between treatment groups. 
31-10-274:  A  phase  3  open-label,  multicentre  study,  to  evaluate  the  long-
term  safety  and  tolerability  of  QW  oral  aripiprazole  in  children  and 
adolescents with TD 
Description 
Trial 31-10-274 was a 52-week open-label, multicentre safety investigation of 52.5 mg, 77.5 mg, and 
110  mg  QW  ECER  aripiprazole  in  children  and  adolescents  with  a  diagnosis  of  TD.  Subjects  who 
successfully  completed  either  of  the  randomised,  doubleblind,  placebo-controlled  trials  (Trials  31-10-
272  or 31-10-273)  were eligible  to enter  this  extension  trial,  provided  that  continuation  of  treatment 
was  clinically  warranted,  as  judged  by  the  investigator,  and  there  were  no  significant  protocol 
deviations  or  clinically  relevant  AEs  precluding  inclusion  in  the  trial.  Prior  to  Protocol  Amendment  2, 
subjects  who  completed  Week  5  in  the  parent  trial  and  were  terminated  early  due  to  lack  of  efficacy 
were  also  eligible  to  enter  this  trial.  At  the  Week  7  (+-1  day)  visit  of  the  doubleblind  trials,  subjects 
took their final dose of double-blind trial medication. On Day 0 of the open-label trial, subjects began 
taking the open-label QW ECER aripiprazole treatment. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary:  The  primary  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  long-term  safety  and  tolerability  of  aripiprazole 
once-weekly  (QW)  treatment  with  oral  tablets  in  children  and  adolescents  (7  to  17  years)  with  a 
diagnosis of Tourette’s disorder (TD). 
Secondary: The secondary objectives were: 
To evaluate the efficacy of QW aripiprazole in the suppression of tics in children and adolescents with a 
diagnosis of TD, as measured by change from baseline to endpoint on the Total Tic score (TTS) of the 
Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS); 
To  evaluate  the  long-term  effect  of  QW  aripiprazole  flexibly  dosed  on  health-related  quality  of  life  in 
children and adolescents with a diagnosis of TD, as measured by the Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome-
Quality of Life Scale (GTS-QOL).

Study design 
Subjects  who  successfully  completed  either  of  the  randomised,  doubleblind,  placebo-controlled  trials 
(Trials 31-10-272 or 31-10-273) were eligible to enter this extension trial, provided that continuation 
of  treatment  was  clinically  warranted,  as  judged  by  the  investigator,  and  there  were  no  significant 
protocol deviations or clinically relevant AEs precluding inclusion in the trial. All subjects entering trial 
31-10-274  were  assigned to  QW  ECER  aripiprazole, which  was  flexibly  dosed QW  at  the  discretion  of 
the investigator on the basis of treatment response and medication tolerability. All subjects began on a 
52.5-mg  dose.  At  the  Week  1  visit,  according  to  the  investigator’s  discretion  based  on  efficacy  and 
tolerability, the dose of aripiprazole remained at 52.5 mg or was increased to 77.5 mg. The dose was 
further increased to 110 mg for efficacy needs as early as Week 2. For the remainder of the trial, the 
dose  was  adjusted  between  the  3  dose  levels,  at  the  investigator’s  discretion.  General  dosing  rules 
included all dosing changes should have been made at a scheduled visit, however, if a dosing change 
was made prior to a visit, there must have been one week between dose changes; all dose increases 
or decreases must have been incremental; that is, increased to the next higher dose or decreased to 
the next lower dose 
Study population /Sample size 
Approximately  223  children  and  adolescent  subjects  with  TD  were  expected  to  be  eligible  to  rollover 
from  Trials  31-10-272  and  31-10-273.  Approximately  156  subjects  were  expected  to  be  eligible  and 
consent to continue in this open-label extension trial. A total of 170 subjects were actually enrolled in 
this  trial  (114  subjects  from  Trial  31-10-272  and  56  subjects  from  Trial  31-10-273)  and  received  at 
least one dose of trial medication. Overall, 170 subjects were included in the safety population and 168 
subjects  were  analyzed  for  efficacy;  2  subjects,  who  discontinued  early,  had  no  postbaseline  efficacy 
assessment and, therefore, were not included in the efficacy analysis. 
Subjects must have successfully 
completed the final assessment visit or, prior to Protocol Amendment 2, discontinued 
because  of  lack  of  efficacy  at  Week  5  or  later  in  either  Trial  31-10-272  or  Trial  31-10-273  and 
completed all required assessments for the Week 8/early termination visit to be 
eligible to rollover into this open-label trial. 
Treatments 
All subjects who qualified for the trial were assigned to treatment with open-label aripiprazole QW as a 
flexible-dose  regimen.  Once-weekly  aripiprazole  was  administered  every  7  days,  beginning  on  Day  0 
(Baseline)  of  the  open-label  trial.  Doses  were  to  be  taken  on  the  same  day  each  week  (+-  1  day) 
without  regard  to  meals.  The  open-label  treatment  period  was  52  weeks.  Three  enteric-coated 
extended-release  (ECER)  dose  strengths  of  an  aripiprazole  tablet  formulation  were  used  in  this  trial: 
The  route  of  administration  was  oral.  Aripiprazole  tablets  were  manufactured  by  Patheon 
Pharmaceuticals (US). The lot numbers of trial medication were as follows: 
•  Aripiprazole ECER 52.5-mg tablet: lots 3089002R and 3097022R 
•  Aripiprazole ECER 77.5-mg tablet: lots 3089003R and 3097023R 
•  Aripiprazole ECER 110-mg tablet: lots 3089004R and 3097024R 
As  a  general  rule,  the  maintenance  dose  of  trial  medication  was  at  the  discretion  of  the  investigator 
and  depended  on  the  subject’s  clinical  response  and  medication  tolerability.  All  subjects  began  on  a 
CHMP assessment report for paediatric use studies submitted according to Article 46 of 
the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 
EMA/CHMP/92268/2015 
Page 18/24 
 
 
 
52.5-mg  dose  QW.  At  Week  1,  according  to  the  investigator’s  discretion  based  on  efficacy  and 
tolerability,  the  dose  of  aripiprazole  QW  could  have  remained  at  52.5  mg  or  been  increased  to  77.5 
mg. The dose could have been increased to 110 mg QW for efficacy needs as early as Week 2. For the 
remainder of the trial, the dose could have been adjusted between these 3 dose levels, as determined 
by investigator discretion. General dosing rules included the following: 
1)  All  dosing  changes  were  to  be  made  at  a  scheduled  visit;  however,  if  the  dose  change  was  made 
prior to a visit, there must have been one week between dose changes. 
2) All dose increases or decreases must have been  incremental; that is, increased to the next higher 
dose or decreased to the next lower dose. 
The open-label treatment period was planned to be 52 weeks. Because the trial was terminated early, 
not all subjects were permitted to complete 52 weeks of aripiprazole QW. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Safety (Primary Endpoint): The safety endpoints included assessment of the following: 
•  AEs 
• 
Laboratory  tests  (hematology,  serum  chemistry  [including  prolactin  and  thyroid-stimulating 
hormone], urinalysis, and pregnancy tests) 
•  Vital signs 
• 
ECGs 
•  AIMS and other EPS scales 
•  C-SSRS 
•  ADD/ADHD Subscale of SNAP-IV 
•  CY-BOCS 
•  CDRS-R 
• 
PARS 
•  Body weight 
•  Waist circumference 
•  BMI 
Efficacy (Secondary Endpoint): The secondary efficacy endpoints assessed included the following:

endpoint  in  YGTSS  TTS,  OR  a  CGI-TS  Change  score  of  1  [very  much  improved]  or  2  [much 
improved] at endpoint) 
•

Functional  outcome  (Secondary  Endpoint):  The  functional  outcome  endpoint  (considered  a  secondary 
endpoint) was the mean change from baseline to endpoint in GTS-QOL overall score. 
Statistical Methods 
There was no formal sample size calculation to achieve a target power; approximately 223 children and 
adolescent subjects with TD were expected to be eligible to rollover into this trial. 
Subject Samples: The Safety Sample included all subjects who received at least one dose of open-label 
trial medication. The Efficacy Sample included all subjects who received at least one dose of open-label 
trial  medication,  and  had  a  baseline  and  at  least  one  postbaseline  efficacy  evaluation.  The  Safety 
Sample was used for all statistical summaries for safety endpoints and the Efficacy Sample was  used 
for efficacy endpoints, unless otherwise specified. The Observed Case dataset for the Safety Sample or 
Efficacy  Sample  at  the  endpoint  or  at  a  particular  trial  week  consisted  of  data  from  all  subjects  who 
had nonmissing scores at that week for the safety or efficacy variable under analysis. 
Efficacy:  No  inferential  statistical  analyses  were  planned  for  this  open-label  trial  and  descriptive 
statistics are provided for all efficacy variables. Continuous variables were summarized by tabulations 
of  mean,  median,  range,  and  standard  deviation.  Tabulations  of  frequency  and  percentage  were 
provided for categorical variables. The efficacy variables, which included YGTSS TTS and Total YGTSS 
score,  were  summarized  by  change  from  baseline  to  endpoint  and  also  by  change  over  time.  The 
functional outcome variable, GTS-QOL, was summarized by change from baseline to endpoint and also 
by  change  over  time.  Efficacy  measured  by  CGI-TS  Change  score  or  response  rates  was  summarized 
for those evaluations at each visit. 
Safety:  Safety  variables  were  summarized  by  descriptive  statistics.  The  incidences  of  suicidality, 
suicidal  behavior,  and  suicidal  ideation  were  calculated  from  the  potential  suicide  events  recorded  on 
the C-SSRS forms, and the results were summarized by visit. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
114 subjects were enrolled from Trial 31-10-272 and 56 subjects were enrolled from Trial 31-10-273. 
A total of 89 (52.4%) subjects completed the trial: 60 (52.6%) subjects from Trial 31-10-272 and 29 
(51.8%)  subjects  from  Trial  31-10-273.  The  most  frequent  reason  for  trial  discontinuation  was  the 
sponsor discontinued the trial (43 of 170 [25.3%] subjects). Other main reasons for discontinuations 
included:  subject  withdrew  consent  (12  [7.1%]  subjects)  and  subject  met  withdrawal  criteria  (10 
[5.9%] subjects). 
Baseline data 
A total of 170 subjects were screened for this trial and enrolled: 114 subjects were enrolled from Trial 
31-10-272 and 56 subjects were enrolled from Trial 31-10-273. Overall, 170 subjects were included in 
the  safety  population  and  168  subjects  were  analyzed  for  efficacy.  A  total  of  89  (52.4%)  subjects 
completed  the  trial  (ie,  completed  the  Week  52  Visit).  The  most  frequent  reason  for  trial 
discontinuation  was  the  sponsor  discontinued  the  trial  (43  of  170  [25.3%]  subjects).  Other  main 
reasons for discontinuations included subject withdrew consent (12 [7.1%] subjects) and subject met 
withdrawal criteria (10 [5.9%] subjects). 
This trial was discontinued early based on the review of the recent data from placebo-controlled Trial 
31-10-272 (aripiprazole QW) relative to the results of placebo-controlled Trial 31-12-293 (aripiprazole

once  daily  [QD])  in  subjects  with  TD.  The  aripiprazole  QW  formulation  was  found  to  be  statistically 
superior  to  placebo  in  Trial  31-10-272,  but  the  demonstrated  efficacy  was  not  as  robust  as  that 
observed  with  the  QD  formulation  in  Trial  31-12-293.  Therefore,  the  QW  formulation  will  not  be 
pursued for the treatment of TD. Importantly, the trial closure was unrelated to any safety issues (no 
signals or items of concern have been identified). 
The mean age of subjects was 12.2 years with a mean time since first diagnosis of 2.3 years. Subjects 
were  evenly  distributed  between  age  groups:  89  of  170  (52.4%)  subjects  in  the  7-  to  12-year  age 
group and 81 of 170 (47.6%) subjects in the 13- to 18-year age group (subjects who turned 18 during 
the parent trial were permitted to enroll in this trial). The mean weight and BMI were 51.5 kg and 21.0 
kg/m2,  respectively.  The  majority  of  subjects  were  White  (117  of  170  [68.8%]  subjects)  and  not 
Hispanic or Latino (136 of 170 [80.0%] subjects). 
Efficacy results 
No primary efficacy endpoints were included. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Since  the  trial  was  discontinued  by  the  sponsor,  no  inferential  analyses  were  carried  out  and  only 
descriptive  statistics  were  used  to  summarize  all  efficacy  data,  therefore,  data  should  be  interpreted 
with caution. The response rate based on the OC data ranged from 66.2% to 80.8% during the course 
of the trial. At the last visit, 117 of 170 (71.3%) subjects were responders. Overall, 81 of 170 (47.6%) 
subjects  discontinued  the  trial;  the  primary  reason  for  discontinuation  was  the  sponsor  discontinued 
the  trial.  Only  38  of  170  (22.4%)  subjects  discontinued  the  trial  for  reasons  other  than  sponsor 
discontinued trial. 
As  expected,  no  clinically  meaningful  differences  were  observed  in  CGI-TS  Change  score,  CGI-TS 
Severity of Illness score, or the change from baseline in YGTSS TTS, Total YGTSS score, or GTS-QOL 
overall score; subjects rolled over from another trial and those who were on aripiprazole in the parent 
trial already improved in the previous trial. The majority of subjects (66.2% to 80.8%) responded to 
treatment  with  the  aripiprazole  QW  formulation  during  the  course  of  the  trial.  Overall,  81  of  170 
(47.6%) subjects discontinued treatment, primarily because the sponsor discontinued the trial. Only 38 
of  170  (22.4%)  subjects discontinued  treatment  for  reasons  other  than  the  sponsor  discontinued  the 
trial. 
Safety results 
No  deaths  occurred  during  the  trial.  Serious  treatment-emergent  AEs  (TEAEs)  were  reported  for  5  of 
170  (2.9%)  subjects.  The  serious  TEAEs  consisted  of  TD  (worsening  Tourette’s  syndrome)  in  one 
subject;  appendicitis  and  suicidal  ideation  in  one  subject;  type  1  diabetes  mellitus  in  one  subject; 
tremor  in  one  subject;  and  increased  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT),  increased  aspartate 
aminotransferase  (AST),  increased  blood  creatine  phosphokinase  (CPK),  and  increased  blood  lactate 
dehydrogenase  (LDH)  in  one  subject.  All  of  the  serious  TEAEs  were  reported  for  subjects  who  rolled 
over  from  Trial  31-10-272.  Only  the  serious  TEAEs  of  increased  ALT,  increased  AST,  increased  blood 
CPK,  and  increased  blood  LDH  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  potentially  related  to 
investigational  medicinal  product  (IMP);  these  events  resolved.  Treatment-emergent  AEs  that  led  to 
IMP discontinuation were reported for 6 of 170 (3.5%) subjects. The TEAEs leading to discontinuation 
of IMP included depressed mood, intentional self-injury, nausea, tonsillitis, tremor, and type 1 diabetes 
mellitus, which were reported for one subject each. All of the TEAEs that led to discontinuation of IMP 
were  reported  for  subjects  who  rolled  over  from  Trial  31-10-272.  The  only  TEAE  that  led  to  the 
CHMP assessment report for paediatric use studies submitted according to Article 46 of 
the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 
EMA/CHMP/92268/2015 
Page 21/24 
 
 
 
discontinuation  of  IMP  and  was  considered  by  the  investigator  as  potentially  causally  related  to  IMP 
was nausea, which was moderate in severity and resolved. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs (with ≥ 5% incidence) were headache (11.2%), increased weight 
(8.2%),  nasopharyngitis,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  and  vomiting  (7.1%  each),  somnolence 
(6.5%), and nausea (5.9%). Treatment-emergent AEs related to EPS were experienced by 8 subjects. 
No  meaningful  changes  were  observed  for  the  EPS  rating  scales  of  AIMS,  SAS,  and  BARS.  Suicide-
related  TEAEs  were  reported  for  3  subjects  and  consisted  of  suicidal  ideation  and  intentional  self-
injury;  none  of  these  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  potentially  causally  related  to  IMP. 
Suicidality and suicidal ideation were each reported on the  C-SSRS for 4 of 169 (2.4%) subjects and 
emergence of suicidal ideation was reported on the C-SSRS for 3 of 167 (1.8%) subjects. 
Weight gain-related TEAEs were reported for 15 subjects; of those, increased weight was reported for 
14 of 170 (8.2%) subjects and increased appetite was reported for 4 of 170 (2.4%) subjects. Two of 
170  (1.2%)  subjects  had  prolactin-related  TEAEs  of  decreased  blood  prolactin,  1  of  170  (0.6%) 
subjects  had  a  hyperglycemia-  and    diabetes-related  TEAE  of  type  1  diabetes  mellitus,  and  1  of  170 
(0.6%) subjects had a lipid parameter-related TEAE of dyslipidemia; no subjects had TEAEs related to 
overdose. 
Overall, 82 of 166 (49.4%) subjects had a potentially clinically relevant weight gain (> 7%) during the 
trial;  however,  the  majority  of  these  appear  to  be  due  to  the  normal  growth  of  this  pediatric 
population.  Overall,  the  mean  (range)  change  from  baseline  to  last  visit  in  weight  and  BMI  were  3.8 
(−15.3 to 21.2) kg and 0.6 (−5.8 to 6.8) kg/m2, respectively. 
Elevated  fasting  triglycerides  was  the  most  frequently  reported  laboratory  value  of  potential  clinical 
relevance  (19  of  145  [13.1%]  subjects);  however,  11  of  these  subjects  had  elevated  fasting 
triglyceride  levels  at  baseline  for  the  parent  trial  and/or  this  trial.  No  other  meaningful  findings  were 
shown in clinical laboratory values, vital signs, physical examinations, or ECG parameters. 
Of the safety rating scales, SNAP-IV, CY-BOCS, CDRS-R, and PARS, no clinically meaningful differences 
in the changes from baseline to last visit were observed. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Study 31-10-272 
Aripiprazole  was  efficacious  in  the  treatment  of  tics  in  children  and  adolescents  (aged  7  to  17  years) 
with a diagnosis of TD. The improvement after administration of oral weekly doses of 52.5 to 110 mg 
of  aripiprazole  (average  dose  of  75.3  mg  QW)  in  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  of  YGTSS  TTS  was 
observed  at  Week  8.  Efficacy  was  supported  by  statistically  significant  changes  in  the  key  secondary 
endpoint of CGI-TS Change Score. Oral doses of 52.5 mg QW to 110 mg QW of aripiprazole (average

dose  of  75.3  mg  QW)  were  generally  well  tolerated  in  pediatric  subjects  with  TD,  and  no  new  safety 
findings were identified in this population. 
Unfortunately  these  results  were  worse  than  the  ones  performed  on  TD  patients  with  the  standard 
formulation. As such, the formulation was abandoned, and studies 273 and 274 were discontinued. 
Study 31-10-273 
This  trial  was  terminated  early;  however,  this  was  not  due  to  any  safety  issue.  Since  the  trial  was 
terminated early, no inferential analyses were carried out and instead descriptive statistics were used 
to summarize efficacy data of this trial. 
The  aripiprazole  QW  110  mg  group  reported  the  highest  incidence  of  subjects  with  TEAEs  (17  of  21 
[81.0%]  subjects  reported  57  TEAEs).  Similar  incidences  of  TEAEs  were  reported  in  the  aripiprazole 
QW  52.5  mg,  aripiprazole  QW  77.5  mg,  and  placebo  groups.  Most  TEAEs  were  mild  or  moderate  in 
severity. No deaths or serious TEAEs were reported during the trial. Only 1 subject discontinued from 
the trial due to AEs; this subject was in the aripiprazole QW 77.5 mg group. Treatment-emergent AEs 
potentially  causally  related  to  IMP  were  reported  for  fewer  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  than  the 
aripiprazole  groups.  EPS-related  TEAEs  were  reported  for  3  subjects  (tremor  was  reported  in  1  of  20 
[5.0%] subjects in the aripiprazole QW 52.5 mg group, muscle spasms in 1 of 21 [4.8%] subjects in 
the aripiprazole QW 110 mg group, and akathisia in 1 of 21 [4.8%] subjects in the placebo group). 
Increased weight was reported for 1 of 20 (5.0%) subjects in the aripiprazole QW 52.5 mg group and 1 
of 21 (4.8%) subjects in the aripiprazole QW 110 mg group. Increased appetite was reported in 1 of 
21 (4.8%) subjects in the aripiprazole QW 77.5 mg group. A prolactin-related TEAE (decreased blood 
prolactin) was reported for 1 of 20 (5.0%) subjects in the aripiprazole QW 52.5 mg group. No suicide-, 
hyperglycemia-, diabetes-, lipid parameter-, or overdose-related AEs were reported during the trial. No 
other  meaningful  differences  were  shown  in  clinical  laboratory  values,  vital  signs,  physical 
examinations, or ECG parameters. No meaningful differences in change from baseline were observed in 
the AIMS, BARS, SAS, C-SSRS, ADD/ADHD Subscale of SNAP-IV, CY-BOCS, CDRS-R, or PARS between 
treatment  groups.  No  meaningful  differences  in  the  change  from  baseline  to  Week  8  between 
treatment  groups  were  observed  in  YGTSS  TTS  in  the  ITT  Sample  in  the  OC  and  LOCF  datasets.  The 
CGI-TS change scores at Week 8 were similar between the placebo group and the aripiprazole QW 52.5 
mg  and  77.5  mg  groups,  for  the  OC  and  LOCF  datasets.  No  meaningful  differences  in  mean  change 
from  baseline  were  observed  between  treatment  groups  in  the  GTS-QOL  Overall  Score,  Total  YGTSS 
Score, and CGI-TS Severity Score for the OC and LOCF datasets. The highest rate of responders was 
the aripiprazole QW 110 mg group for both the OC and LOCF datasets (13 responders [81.3%] and 15 
responders [75.0%], respectively). 
Study 31-10-274 
Long-term  treatment  (up  to  one  year)  with  oral  aripiprazole  52.5  to  110  mg  QW  was  rather  well 
tolerated in pediatric subjects with TD. The most frequently reported TEAEs (with ≥ 5% incidence) after 
treatment with aripiprazole QW (headache, increased weight, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract 
infection,  vomiting,  somnolence,  and  nausea)  were  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of 
aripiprazole,  with  the  exception  of  upper  respiratory  tract  infection.  Serious  TEAEs  considered  to  be 
potentially  related  to  IMP  were  reported  for  1  subject  and  included  increased  ALT,  increased  AST, 
increased blood CPK, and increased blood LDH. Only 1 TEAE leading to the discontinuation of IMP was 
considered  potentially  related  to  IMP  (nausea).  The  most  frequently  reported  potentially  clinically 
relevant  abnormalities  included  weight  gain  (>7%)  (49.4%)  and  elevated  fasting  triglycerides 
(13.1%); most of the weight gain observed during this trial appears to be due to normal growth in this 
pediatric population. No other meaningful findings were shown in clinical laboratory values, vital signs, 
physical examinations, and ECG parameters. No meaningful changes were observed for the EPS rating

scales  (AIMS,  SAS,  and  BARS),  SNAP-IV,  CY-BOCS,  CDRS-R,  or  PARS.  Suicide-related  TEAEs  were 
reported  for  3  subjects;  none  of  these  were  considered  potentially  related  to  IMP.  In  addition, 
suicidality (2.4%), suicidal ideation (2.4%), and emergence of suicidal ideation (1.8%) were reported 
on the C-SSRS. 
As  expected  no  clinically  meaningful  changes  from  baseline  were  observed  for  the  efficacy  scales; 
subjects rolled over from  another trial and those  who were on aripiprazole in the parent trial already 
improved  in  the  previous  trial.  However,  the  majority  of  subjects  (66.2%  to  80.8%)  responded  to 
treatment with aripiprazole QW during the course of the trial. This trial was terminated early; however, 
this was not due to any safety issue. 
Nevertheless, the number of patients with weight gain was relevant, 82 of 166 (49.4%) subjects had a 
potentially  clinically  relevant  weight  gain  (>  7%)  during  the  trial.  It  hardly  should  be  due  to  normal 
child and adolescent growth, as some of the growing children would not increase >7% their weight. 
3.  CHMP’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
These  studies  were  performed  in  TD  patients,  within  the  plan  for  the  development  of  a  new  once  a 
week aripiprazole formulation. The efficacy results lagged behind the once a day marketed formulation 
studies 31-12-293 and 031-KOA-0703) . Safety results: Adverse events were in the range of adverse 
events  on  the  above  mentioned  studies  performed  with  the  standard  formulation,  both  in  frequency, 
intensity and severity, considering the short duration of 31-10-272, and the abruptly ended 31-10-273 
and 31-10-274. Even weight gain, an adverse event that is time dependent, was rather different from 
31-12-293  /  031-KOA-0703,  but  in  line  with  the  weight  gain  observed  on  long  term  treatment  of 
children  in  other  indications.  As  such,  the  presented  data  is  not  adding  useful  information  to  what  is 
already known with aripiprazole. No update on SmPC or PL is suggested. 
Submission was accompanied with the information that the MAH would not apply to a change in SmPC.

  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

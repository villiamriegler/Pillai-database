SmPC and PL 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
Rydapt in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity. 
Pursuant to Article 23(3) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, 
Rydapt (midostaurin) is removed from the additional 
monitoring list as a new active substance following five 
years of authorisation. As a result the black triangle and 
relevant warnings are being removed from PI

Section 4.2 Under Hepatic impairment it is added that  
“Exposure to midostaurin and its active metabolite 
CGP62221 is substantially lower in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment than that in patients with normal 
hepatic function (see section 5.2). However, there are 
insufficient efficacy data in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment to suggest a dose adjustment is required.” The 
relevant warning is removed from section 4.4.

paediatric patients with FLT3-mutated AML. Among the 
three FLT3-mutated AML patients enrolled in the study, two 
patients (10 and 14 years old) experienced dose limiting 
toxicities (DLTs) following the second induction cycle with 
midostaurin (at 30 mg/m2 twice daily) in combination with 
chemotherapy (containing cytarabine 2 g/m2/day, day 1-5; 
fludarabine 30 mg/m2/day, day 1-5 and idarubicin 12 
mg/m2/day, day 2, 4 and 6). Both patients showed 
markedly delayed haematological recoveries (i.e. prolonged 
grade 4 thrombocytopenia lasting for 44 days in the first 
patient and 51 days in the second patient and grade 4 
neutropenia lasting for 46 days in the second patient). In

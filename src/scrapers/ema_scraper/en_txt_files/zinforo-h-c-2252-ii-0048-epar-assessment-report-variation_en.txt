The CHMP is of the opinion that the current product information supports the use of Zinforo in the 
treatment of patients with CSTTI / CAP with concurrent bacteraemia. Following assessment, the CHMP 
however does not consider that the sub-analysis data submitted by MAH provides further scientific 
value or guidance to prescribers to justify the proposed amendment of the product information.  
The MAH is therefore invited to an oral explanation to further justify how the data submitted supports 
the proposed amendments to the product information, particularly given that the current indication, 
together with information in Section 4.4 on any safety concerns and the current information in 5.1, is 
considered by the CHMP to adequately support the use of Zinforo in a broad indication which does not 
exclude bacteraemia. 
Having taken note of the CHMP position, the MAH took the decision on 30/11/2020 to withdraw the 
application. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I are not recommended at 
this stage. 
3.  EPAR changes 
The table in Module 8b of the EPAR will be updated as follows:

4.  Scientific discussion 
4.1.  Introduction 
The most common causative agent of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) in adults and children is 
S. pneumoniae which causes about half of the cases. The usual pathomechanism of CAP is 
microaspiration that leads to pneumococcal colonisation of the nasopharynx. In rare cases, 
pneumococci can invade from nasopharynx to bloodstream and thus cause bacteraemia together with 
pneumonia (sometimes referred to as invasive pneumonia).  
Pneumococcal disease occurs at all ages, but incidence rates show a steep rise, in particular after 
70 years of age. Another but smaller peak occurs at age below 2 years (D. Weycker 2010)11. Whether 
invasive pneumonia has worse outcome than non-invasive pneumonia is less clear. Some studies 
report on short-term mortality in adults (i.e. in-hospital or 30-day mortality) of non-invasive 
pneumococcal pneumonia varying from 5 to 13% and of invasive pneumonia from 13 to 21% (S.P. van 
Mens201512; S.H. Lin, 201113). However, there are also studies that have not seen differences in 
outcome regardless whether pneumococcal CAP is accompanied by bacteraemia or not (Cristin Q. Fritz 
2019)14. Risk factors for a fatal outcome include high age and presence of underlying conditions such 
as chronic cardiovascular, lung, liver or kidney disease (A.J. van Hoek2012). 
The prevalence of invasive pneumonia in children is low and ranges between 1.1% to 7.1% (it was 
5.1% in a recent meta-analysis (Tam et. al. 2015)16. The rates of invasive pneumococcal pneumonia in 
adults have been higher than in children. Of all CAP in adults, around 20–30% is invasive 
pneumococcal pneumonia while 70–80% is non-invasive (D.S. Fedson, 2013), M.A. Said,  2013; 
C.H.van Werkhoven, 2016). Non-invasive pneumococcal pneumonia is usually diagnosed by a positive 
lower respiratory tract culture, or a positive urinary antigen test (UAT) for S. pneumoniae in the 
absence of a positive blood culture while for invasive pneumonia positive blood culture is required. 
British Thoracic Society (BTS), Infectious Diseases Society of America/American Thoracic Society 
(IDSA/ATS) and European guidelines recommend combined treatment with a beta-lactam plus a 
macrolide for CAP requiring hospital admission (W.S. Lim, 2009; M. Woodhead 2011). The beneficial 
effect of combined therapy was reviewed in a meta-analysis published in 2014, and authors concluded 
that from observational studies the addition of a macrolide might reduce the mortality risk of patients 
with CAP. Nevertheless, a recent cluster-randomised, crossover trial with strategies rotated in 4-month 
periods (beta-lactam, beta-lactam plus macrolide or fluoroquinolone), concluded that beta-
lactam monotherapy for CAP requiring hospital admission was not inferior to other strategies regarding 
90-day mortality. Therefore, the debate about the need for combined treatment in patients with CAP is 
still open, particularly for those with moderate to severe CAP. There are no specific guidelines for 
treatment of invasive pneumococcal disease including CAP with bacteraemia but combination rather 
than monotherapy with beta-lactam and macrolide is recommended especially in severe cases based 
on expert opinion (Domínguez-Alegría AR, Pintado V, Barbolla I. RevClinEsp.2018; 218:244-252).   
The current label of ceftaroline fosamil states that Zinforo is indicated for the treatment of complicated 
skin and soft tissue infections and community-acquired pneumonia in neonates, infants, children, 
adolescents and adults. This indication is broad; and both invasive (with bacteraemia) and non-
invasive CAP caused by any microorganisms are already covered. 
4.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/659440/2020 
 
  
 
 
4.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) has been submitted. This is justified by the applicant as 
Zinforo is already approved in the EU for the treatment of CAP and is currently being used by CAP 
patients with concurrent bacteraemia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae. As existing CAP patients with 
concurrent bacteraemia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae are currently being treated with Zinforo, no 
increase in use is expected upon approval, therefore no environmental risk assessment is provided in 
this Type II variation for Zinforo. This justification is acceptable. 
4.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Based on the updated data submitted in this application, the extended indication does not lead to a 
significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of ceftaroline fosamil. 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
4.3.  Clinical aspects 
4.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
4.3.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
No new clinical pharmacology data are submitted that impact the benefit/risk profile of ceftaroline 
fosamil. 
4.4.  Clinical efficacy 
Ceftaroline fosamil was approved for use in adults for the treatment of cSSTI and CAP in the EU 
(Zinforo) in August 2012. Approval in neonates (birth to < 2 months) for the same 2 indications was 
granted in the EU in July 2019. Use of high dose ceftaroline fosamil in adolescents and adults for the 
treatment of cSSTI known or suspected to be caused by Staphylococcus aureus with a ceftaroline MIC 
of 2 or 4 mg/L was approved in February 2017. Approval for paediatric patients for the same dose and 
condition was granted in the EU in July 2019. 
The original clinical development program for ceftaroline focused on patients with cSSTI and CAP. No 
new studies have been submitted. The extension of the indication to include bacteraemic SP 
(Streptococcus pneumoniae) CAP is based on: 
•  Analysis of efficacy and safety data for a subpopulation of adult patients with bacteraemic SP 
CAP from two Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, comparative studies with 
ceftaroline versus ceftriaxone: Study P903-08 and Study P903-09. 
•  A descriptive summary of efficacy and safety data for bacteraemic SP CAP patients aged 2 
months to < 18 years from one paediatric CAP study: Study P903-31. 
Assessment report  
EMA/659440/2020 
 
  
 
 
 
•  Relevant post-marketing (PM) safety experience with ceftaroline for CAP with SP bacteraemia. 
The data provided to support the extension of the indication are aligned with the communication 
received from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) (meeting date: 28 January 
2015) (Zinforo Pre-submission Meeting Minutes).

4.4.2.  Main study(ies) 
The primary objective in the main studies (P903-08 and P903-09) was the demonstration of non-
inferiority of ceftaroline to ceftriaxone in patients with CAP in the primary efficacy endpoint of clinical 
cure rate at the Test-of-Cure (TOC) Visit in the modified intent-to-treat efficacy (MITTE) and CE 
Populations. These two Phase 3 studies are used for integrated analysis to support the submission of a 
Type II variation for the addition of concurrent bacteraemia in CAP due to S. pneumoniae (SP) in 
adults to the SmPC. The MAH presented comparison and post-hoc analyses results across these 
studies. In the analysis conducted for this submission, patients were classified as having bacteraemic 
SP CAP or non-bacteraemic SP CAP and were presented by individual studies and overall. Analysis of 
efficacy data for ceftaroline in the treatment of bacteraemic SP CAP was performed on a subpopulation 
of bacteraemic (N=31) and non-bacteraemic SP CAP patients (N=139) from these 2 Phase 3 studies to 
support the characterisation of efficacy for ceftaroline in the treatment of CAP. 
In addition, the MAH presented data of bacteraemic SP CAP patients from paediatric (age 2 months to 
18 years) Phase 2/3 Study P903-31. Because of the limited number of patients and differences in adult 
and paediatric study design, the paediatric study was not integrated with the other studies. 
Study No P903-08 a Phase 3, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-blind, Comparative Study to 
Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Ceftaroline versus Ceftriaxone, with Adjunctive 
Clarithromycin, in the Treatment of Adult Subjects with Community-acquired Pneumonia 
Ceftaroline for injection at a dose of 600 mg administered as a 1-hr IV infusion q12h for 5-7 days was 
non-inferior to ceftriaxone in the treatment of CABP caused by susceptible isolates of the following 
microorganisms: S. aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, H. parainfluenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 
Escherichia coli.  
Altogether 57 patients had infection caused or suspected to be caused by S. pneumoniae of whom 12 
patients were bacteraemic and were included into present analysis; 7 of them were treated with 
ceftaroline; 45 SP CAP patients were non-bacteraemic. 
Study No P903-09 a Phase 3, Multicenter, Randomized, Double-blind, Comparative Study to 
Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Ceftaroline versus Ceftriaxone in the Treatment of Adult 
Subjects with Community-acquired Pneumonia 
Altogether, 82 patients had infection caused or suspected to be caused by S. pneumoniae of whom 19 
patients were bacteraemic and were included into present analysis; 12 of them were treated with 
ceftaroline; 63 SP CAP patients were non-bacteraemic. 
Study P903-31 (Paediatric) a Phase 2/3, Multicenter, Randomized, Observer Blinded, 
Active-Controlled Study Evaluating the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Efficacy 
of Ceftaroline Versus Ceftriaxone in Pediatric Subjects With Community-acquired Bacterial 
Pneumonia Requiring Hospitalization 
Altogether 33 patients had infection caused or suspected to be caused by S. pneumoniae of whom 4 
were bacteraemic; 2 received ceftaroline and another 2 patients received ceftriaxone.

Assessor’s comment 
S. pneumoniae was not listed by the MAH in the summary of any of the adult studies referred to 
above, although S. pneumoniae is the most important susceptible microorganism. The MAH also 
applies for the extension of the indication to include concurrent bacteraemia due to S. pneumoniae. 
However, current CAP indication in the SmPC is nonspecific and does not in any way exclude treatment 
of patients with bacteraemia. Therefore the aim of this line extension is unclear. 
The current and applied indication does not cover treatment of pneumocococcal bacteraemia (included 
into invasive pneumococcal disease). However, pneumococcal bacteraemia may also occur without 
identified source, especially in paediatric population. Still it may occur together with suspected 
pneumonia however no data are presented for this indication. 
In study P903-31, only 2 bacteraemic paediatric patients were included, the number clearly insufficient 
to draw conclusions.  
The applicant presents and discusses data for bacteraemic CAP but not necessarily for bacteraemia 
with CAP. 
5.4.2.1 P903-08 and P903-09 integrated analysis 
Methods 
The general study design and population for studies P903-08 and P903-09 were similar, and these 
studies were integrated for analysis.  
These were a Phase 3 multinational, multicentre, randomised, double blinded studies that enrolled 
adult patients with CAP and employed the same methodology. The studies were identical in design, 
population, inclusion/exclusion criteria, comparator, and dosing regimens, with one exception - Study 
P903-08 included a brief initial course of oral clarithromycin (starting on Day 1 following 
randomisation) for both treatment groups at an approved dosage (500 mg q12h for a total of 2 doses) 
as adjunctive therapy to provide initial coverage against “atypical” pathogens”.  
Both studies compared ceftaroline to ceftriaxone for 5 to 7 days. According to the protocol, blood 
cultures were recommended to be obtained at baseline and repeated if the previous blood culture was 
positive or if medically indicated (Day 1, Day 2; Day 3; Days 4-6; EOT; TOC and LFU). Blood for 
culture was not obtained at the TOC visit if the subject was deemed a failure at the EOT visit. 
Study P903-08 
S. pneumoniae was the most commonly isolated pathogen (57/155, 36.8%) in the mMITTE 
population. Among the S. pneumoniae isolates, MDRSP (defined as resistance to two or more classes 
of antibiotics, including penicillin, macrolides, tetracycline, fluoroquinolones, chloramphenicol, 
trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, and second generation cephalosporins), was rare (two in ceftaroline 
group and one in ceftriaxone group) and no PRSP was identified according to CLSI 2008 breakpoints 
for non-meningeal pneumococcal infections. Approximately 65% of S. pneumoniae were identified with 
the urinary antigen test for S. pneumoniae, and some of these were positive on culture. Of those 
positive by respiratory or blood culture, approximately 30% had a positive streptococcal urinary 
antigen. A wide distribution of S. pneumoniae serotypes was identified.  
Overall approximately 11% (17/155) of subjects in this population had bacteraemia at baseline in both 
treatment groups. The most commonly isolated pathogen from blood culture was S. pneumoniae 
(12/155, 70.6%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/659440/2020 
 
  
 
 
 
Study P903-09 
Approximately 75% of subjects in the mMITTE population had growth of at least one typical pathogen 
from a respiratory specimen, 15% from blood, and approximately 24% from pneumococcal urinary 
antigen testing. The most commonly isolated pathogen was S. pneumoniae (82/178, 46.1%). Among 
the S. pneumoniae isolates, ten (2 in the ceftaroline group and 8 in the ceftriaxone group) were 
identified as MDRSP and no PRSP were identified according to CLSI 2008 breakpoints for non-
meningeal pneumococcal infections. A wide distribution of S. pneumoniae serotypes was identified. No 
serotype was found in more than 4 subjects in each treatment group. Approximately 50% of S. 
pneumoniae were identified with the urinary antigen test for S. pneumoniae and some of these were 
positive by culture. Of those positive by respiratory or blood culture, approximately 25% had a positive 
streptococcal urinary antigen. A higher percentage of subjects in the ceftaroline group had 
bacteraemia, 16.7% (15/90) compared with the ceftriaxone group 12.5% (11/88). The most 
commonly isolated pathogen from blood culture was S. pneumoniae (19/178, 73.0%). 
In the analysis conducted for this submission, patients were classified as having bacteraemic SP CAP 
(e.g. those with positive blood cultures) or non-bacteraemic SP CAP (e.g. those with negative blood 
cultures) and were presented by individual studies and overall. No formal statistical hypotheses were 
tested; evaluation of the data consisted primarily of summary displays (ie, descriptive statistics). 
Efficacy results are descriptive and limited to small patient numbers. 
In order to support the submission of a Type II variation for the addition of concurrent bacteraemia in 
CAP due to SP to the indication, efficacy data from the mMITTE and ME populations were integrated. 
No formal statistical hypotheses were conducted for this analysis; evaluation of the data consisted

The MAH presents a subgroup analysis of two adult studies with the aim of applying the addition of SP 
bacteraemia to the approved indication of CAP. No new studies were performed but patients with CAP 
caused by S. pneumoniae were re-analysed and compared in two groups – those with bacteraemia and 
those without. The outcome that was compared was that of CAP. In two studies there were in total of 
31 adult patients and in the paediatric study (discussed separately below, please see section 5.4.2.2) - 
4 paediatric patients with bacteraemia. Thus the number of CAP SP bacteraemia  patients is very 
small. 
To justify the proposed variation to the indication, the Applicant makes references to minutes of 
Zinforo COVERS pre-submission Agency Meeting from January 28, 2015 where among other issues 
advice was also sought on the use of ceftaroline in patients with bacteraemia that occurs in association 
with, or is suspected to be associated with CAP or cSSTI. The Agency comments were as follows: : 
“the Guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products indicated for treatment of bacterial infections is 
not intended to be applicable for new or recently approved drugs (like ceftaroline) as this was meant 
for harmonization of the SmPC for older antibiotics. The guidance is there because certain member 
states were not willing to remove bacteraemia from their labels. Generally, the CHMP does not like to 
endorse drugs for use in bacteraemia patients. If an application is made, data need to be split by 
organism, indication and study. Pivotal data and comparative trial data are key – observational data 
are not acceptable. It is although acceptable to use data from q8h and q12h and should provide both 
mMITT and ME. No set number of patients are required; compelling comparative data are important. 
The indication may be pathogen specific, for example, S. aureus bacteraemia associated with a cSSTI. 
This would be seen as a precedent setting application, CHMP need to very carefully evaluate the data 
and set their decision in context. This would be to ensure that all future approvals for the inclusion of 
bacteraemia were consistent.“ 
Bacteraemia with only one microorganism (S. pneumoniae) associated with only one indication (CAP) 
is applied by the MAH to be included to the indication. This is considered to have minimal, if any, 
clinical relevance. It remains unclear why only S. pneumoniae bacteraemia is applied for and other 
causative microorganisms (i.e S. aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Haemophilus parainfluenzae, 
Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli) are not. Furthermore as mentioned above, current label 
already covers S. pneumoniae bacteraemia that is associated with CAP because label does not specify 
whether patients with bacteraemia should be treated or not. 
Addendum to the guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products indicated for treatment of bacterial 
infections states the following regarding non-pathogen-specific bacteraemia: „It may be possible to 
accumulate sufficient clinical data to support an indication for use of an antibacterial agent in the 
treatment of bacteraemia that is associated with specific types of infection, with or without restriction 
to certain pathogens. For example, in the case of agents that have been in use for many years and are 
indicated for use in a broad range of infections the total evidence may be considered sufficient for an 
indication that reads. Treatment of patients with bacteraemia that occurs in association with, or is 
suspected to be associated with, any of the infections listed above (i.e. referring to the list of 
indications approved). If no concern arises from review of the subset with accompanying bacteraemia 
then no statement is made about use in such patients in the SmPC except to mention the limited 
experience. If the antibacterial agent has been evaluated in several indications and the total number of 
bacteraemic patients treated across these indications is deemed sufficient (e.g. ~50 or more) to 
support a conclusion that efficacy is comparable to that in other patients or, at least, comparable to 
that of other treatments, then the addition of the sentence could be considered appropriate.” The 
context of this recommendation has been discussed above (in the Agency advice from the pre-
submission meeting).

Study participants 
This was a post-hoc analysis. The patients were classified as having bacteraemic SP CAP (total n=31, 
19 on ceftaroline, 12 on ceftriaxone) or non-bacteraemic SP CAP (n=108). In addition there were 4 
paediatric patients with SP CAP (2 in each treatment arm). 
Efficacy of ceftaroline in the treatment of bacteraemic SP CAP was evaluated in a pooled subpopulation 
from two previously submitted adult studies (Studies P903-08 and P903-09).  
Assessor’s comment 
The MAH has assessed only bacteraemic S. pneumoniae CAP patients and compared them to the non-
bacteraemic SP CAP patients. Thus, the evaluation covers only bacteraemia of one microorganism in 
one site of infection. All patients had confirmed CAP and there were no patients with suspected CAP. 
The number of bacteraemic SP CAP patients on ceftaroline in pooled analyses was very low – only 19 
patients received ceftaroline. The total number of patients with bacteraemia was smaller than 
suggested by guidance documents (n=31 vs n>50). It is the assessors` understanding that number of 
bacteraemic patients was not predefined. 
Treatments 
In studies P903-08 and P903-09 subjects were randomly assigned to receive either IV ceftaroline 
fosamil or IV ceftriaxone for 5 to 7 days for CAP. The 600-mg q12h dose of ceftaroline fosamil 
administered over 1 hour was divided into two 300-mg doses administered over 30 minutes in order to 
preserve the blind, as ceftriaxone was to be administered as a 1-g dose administered over 30 minutes 
q24h. In the ceftriaxone group, placebo was administered to match Infusion 2 of the first daily dose 
and Infusions 1 and 2 of the second daily dose of ceftaroline fosamil.  
Ceftaroline fosamil dosing regimens could be adjusted to 400 mg q12h for subjects with moderate 
renal impairment. The ceftriaxone dose did not require adjustment for mild or moderate renal 
impairment. 
In both treatment groups in study P903-08, two doses of oral clarithromycin (500 mg) q12h (± 2 
hours), defined as adjunctive therapy, were administered on Study Day 1 with study drug therapy. 
Subjects may have received a single dose of clarithromycin if hospitalised in the evening of Study Day 
1.  
At any time, the dose of ceftaroline fosamil (including the initial dose) could be adjusted by unblinded 
pharmacy staff or unblinded study staff.

Assessor’s comment 
The current guidelines by IDSA recommend a β-lactam (eg, a 3rd-generation cephalosporin) plus 
macrolide in combination for treatment of inpatient patients with CAP. Ceftriaxone is recommended to 
be given once or twice daily. In addition, ceftriaxone and ceftaroline are both cephalosporins with 
similar antibacterial spectrum, the choice of comparator is suitable. The doses correspond to those 
suggested in guidelines. There are no specific recommendations for patients with bacteraemic SP 
pneumonia. 
Objectives of the subpopulation analysis (bacteraemic SP CAP patients) 
This post-hoc sub-analysis aimed to evaluate efficacy in patients with SP bacteraemic CAP in the 
mMITTE and ME population. The primary analysis was the clinical response rate at test-of-cure (TOC). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Clinical cure rate of CAP in patients with SP bacteraemic CAP vs non-bacteraemic CAP at the TOC visit 
in the mMITTE and ME population. 
Clinical cure - total resolution of all signs and symptoms of the baseline CAP or improvement to such 
an extent that further antimicrobial therapy was not necessary. 
Subgroup analysis on clinical response rate at TOC was performed by PORT class (III and IV). 
Blood for culture were recommended to be obtained at baseline; repeat blood for culture was obtained 
if the previous blood culture was positive or if medically indicated (Day 1, Day 2; Day 3; Days 4-6; 
EOT; TOC and LFU). Blood for culture was not obtained at the TOC visit if the subject was deemed a 
failure at the EOT visit.  
Per-Pathogen Microbiological Response 
A microbiological outcome at the TOC visit was determined in the mMITTE and ME populations for each 
pathogen isolated at baseline. Microbiological outcome categories at TOC are eradication, presumed 
eradication, persistence, presumed persistence, and indeterminate. Favourable microbiological 
outcomes are eradication or presumed eradication. Unfavourable microbiological outcomes are 
persistence or presumed persistence.

Table 5.4.2.2 Microbiological Outcome Categories at TOC 
Per-Subject Microbiological Response 
Per-subject microbiological response at the TOC visit was determined in the mMITT, the mMITTE and 
ME populations based on individual outcomes for each baseline pathogen. In order for a subject to 
have a favourable microbiological response, the outcome for each baseline pathogen must be 
favourable (eradicated or presumed eradicated). If the outcome for any pathogen was unfavourable 
(persistence or presumed persistence), the subject was considered to have an unfavourable 
microbiological response. 
Assessor’s comment 
The subgroup analysis of bacteraemic and non-bacteraemic SP CAP patients from two previously 
submitted Phase 3 studies was performed to evaluate the efficacy of ceftaroline versus ceftriaxone, in 
the treatment of bacteraemic SP CAP. The outcome of this analysis included the assessment of clinical 
cure of CAP. The MAH has not provided microbiological data in terms of resolution of bacteraemia for 
this submission. The MAH should clarify the microbiological outcome of the bacteraemic patients (the 
eradication day, incl Day 1, Day 2; Day 3; Days 4-6; EOT; TOC or LFU) and specify the meaning of 
“Presumed eradication” (only clinical cure or eradication before TOC already) (OC). 
Sample size 
In the analysis conducted for this submission, patients were classified as having bacteraemic SP CAP or 
non-bacteraemic SP CAP and were presented by individual adult studies P903-08 and P903-09 and 
overall. No formal statistical hypotheses were conducted; evaluation of the data consisted primarily of 
summary displays (i.e., descriptive statistics). Efficacy results are descriptive and limited by small 
patient numbers: 31 adult patients from 2 studies overall (19 of them in ceftaroline group). Of the 139 
SP CAP patients included in this pooled analysis, 31 (22.3%) had associated bacteraemia. The 
proportion of patients with bacteraemia was comparable between the two studies, with a higher 
proportion in the ceftaroline-treatment groups.

11/59 (18.6) 
28/122 (23.0) 
Of the 139 Streptococcus pneumoniae CAP patients from studies P903-08 and P903-09 included in the 
pooled analysis, 31 (22.3%) had associated bacteraemia in mMITTE population.  
As mentioned already under the methods section, according to the addendum to the guideline on the 
evaluation of medicinal products indicated for the treatment of bacterial infection, the suggested total 
number of bacteraemic patients treated across the indications should be ~50 or more to support a 
conclusion of efficacy. The MAH has not specified upfront the number of patients with bacteraemic 
pneumonia in either adult studies; and this could be a reason that the number was lower than 
suggested in guidelines. 
Statistical methods 
The data are purely descriptive and no formal statistical tests could be applied.  
No formal statistical hypotheses were conducted; evaluation of the data consisted primarily of 
summary displays (ie, descriptive statistics). 
Results 
Baseline data 
Of the 139 SP CAP patients included in this pooled analysis, 31 (22.3%) had associated bacteraemia. 
The proportion of patients with bacteraemia was comparable between the two studies, with a higher 
proportion in the ceftaroline-treatment groups. These proportions were similar for the ME population.  
The mMITTE and ME populations overall and by bacteraemia classification were similar with regard to 
age and gender distribution, with slight differences in some baseline medical history characteristics. 
There was a higher percentage of patients with CAP SP bacteraemia classified to Port Risk Class IV 
compared to III (25.8% [III] vs 74.2% [IV] in the mMITTE analysis set); in contrast, in patients with 
SP CAP without bacteraemia, more were classified to Port Risk Class III (58.3% [III] vs 41.7% [IV]).

MIC values for ceftaroline and ceftriaxone were compared between SP isolates collected from 
bacteraemic and non-bacteraemic SP CAP patients in the mMITTE population. The MIC90 was lower for 
ceftaroline compared to ceftriaxone. Baseline MIC trends were similar for the ME population.

All SP strains were susceptible to study antibiotics. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The results of clinical responses of CAP at TOC for the mMITTE and ME analysis sets were similar. 
Ceftaroline clinical cure rates were 78.9% and 82.4% in the SP bacteraemic mMITTE and ME analysis 
sets, respectively and were similar to non-bacteraemic SP CAP. The clinical cure rates in ceftaroline 
arm were numerically higher than the ceftriaxone arm with no differences in bacteraemic and non-
bacteraemic patients (Table 5.4.2.9).

There was concordance between the microbiological and clinical responses of all patients with SP 
bacteraemia except for 1 patient. This patient, in the ceftriaxone treatment group, had persistent 
symptoms at the end of treatment and was considered a clinical failure at the TOC visit. However, 
blood cultures taken on Study Day 7 were negative, and the patient had a microbiological response of 
eradication at the TOC visit. Of note most patients had microbiological response as presumed 
eradication. 
Based on the MAH analysis of the subpopulations, ceftaroline was as effective as ceftriaxone in treating 
patients with both bacteraemic SP CAP and non-bacteraemic SP CAP.

Assessor’s comment 
With the exception of one patient the remaining were marked as “presumed eradication or presumed 
persistence”. This may indicate that no repeated blood cultures were taken in vast majority of cases 
despite the recommendations given in the protocol. The MAH should clarify this (OC). There were 2 
patients with infection caused by multiple microorganisms (Table 5.4.2.12). The MAH should clarify 
whether all these microorganisms were cultured from blood or were they found in different sites (OC). 
Efficacy results of a subpopulation analysis of patients with bacteraemic SP CAP are descriptive and 
limited by small patient numbers and on response of CAP. Although the rates of clinical cure in 
ceftaroline arm tended to be numerically higher than in the ceftriaxone arm for both bacteraemic and 
non-bacteraemic patient subgroups, the small number of bacteraemic patients does not allow drawing 
conclusions on this indication. Of note, current CAP indication in the SPC does not exclude treatment of 
patients with bacteraemia or invasive CAP. 
Ancillary analyses 
Comparison of Results in Subpopulations  
Clinical response at TOC was analysed by Port Class (III and IV). In the mMITTE analysis set, a higher 
percentage of patients with SP bacteraemia (both treatment groups) were classified as Port Class IV 
Assessment report

compared to patients with non-bacteraemic CAP (23 of 31 [74.2%] patients compared to 45 of 108 
[41.7%]). This was expected for a scoring system based on severity of illness. 
In the mMITTE analysis set, 4 patients (100.0%) in the ceftaroline group in Port Class III had a clinical 
response of clinical cure at TOC compared favourably to the ceftriaxone treatment group (1/4, 25.0%). 
Non-bacteraemic SP CAP patients classified to PORT class III within the mMITTE population also had a 
numerically higher clinical cure in the ceftaroline treatment group (26/30, 86.7%) compared to the 
ceftriaxone treatment group (24/33, 72.7%). There results were similar for the ME population.  
For bacteraemic SP CAP patients in Port Class IV, 11 of 15 (73.3%) in the ceftaroline group had a 
clinical response of clinical cure compared to the ceftriaxone treatment group (7/8, 87.5%). Non-
bacteraemic SP CAP patients classified to PORT class IV within the mMITTE population had a 
numerically higher clinical cure response in the ceftaroline treatment group (18/20, 90.0%) compared 
to the ceftriaxone treatment group (16/25, 64.0%). These results were consistent with the ME 
population however it is noted that there are no SD or any other respective statistical information 
presented to describe the diffusiveness of the data.  
Clinical response at TOC supports that ceftaroline is an effective treatment, even in patients classified 
to Port Class IV.

MAH claims that based on the subpopulation analysis, ceftaroline demonstrates high rates of clinical 
cure in patients with SP CAP, including patients with SP bacteraemia and patients classified to PORT 
class IV. 
Other subgroup analyses using demographic characteristics (such as sex, race, geographic region, 
baseline disease severity, concomitant medications) were not explored, because the number of 
patients in the SP bacteraemia subpopulation in both studies was limited. 
Assessment report 
EMA/659440/2020 
5.4.2.2 Study P903-31 (Paediatric patients) 
Twenty percent of paediatric patients had positive results for S. pneumoniae. Respiratory specimens 
for microbiological testing were obtained from less than 8% of subjects at baseline; this is consistent 
with the challenge of collecting these samples from children and resulting in low pathogen recovery 
overall. Blood cultures were obtained from the majority (97.2%) of subjects and the number of 
positive blood cultures was low (4.2%), again consistent what has been seen in paediatric CAP. 
There is limited data on efficacy of ceftaroline in the treatment of paediatric bacteraemic SP CAP 
patients (age 2 months to 18 years) from Study P903-31. This study had 4 patients with confirmed SP 
bacteraemia; 2 patients received ceftaroline and 2 patients received ceftriaxone. At TOC, none of these 
patients in the ceftaroline group were clinically cured compared to 1 patient in the ceftriaxone group. 
Further evaluation of the two bacteraemic SP CAP paediatric patients treated with ceftaroline was 
undertaken.  
One patient was a 4-year-old female admitted with a left lower lobe CAP. She was deemed a “Non-
Responder” on Study Day 4 based on unstable respiratory rate, though her clinical symptoms showed 
general improvement. She was continued on ceftaroline until Study Day 8 (16 Jan 2104) when 
ceftaroline was discontinued due to insufficient therapeutic effect and replaced with oral clarithromycin 
and IV amoxicillin-clavulanate. 
The other patient was a 3-year-old female admitted with severe pleuropneumonia on the left side, 
atelectasis and vomiting. She was initially treated with ceftaroline and was considered a Responder at 
Study Day 4. During the first week on study, the subject was severely ill, but her condition was stable. 
The following weekend, her general condition deteriorated; she was dyspnoeic and required oxygen. 
An increased volume of pleural fluid was found on ultrasound and chest x-ray revealed atelectasis of 
her whole left lung, which was compressed by pleural fluid and the mediastinum was shifted to the 
right. On Study Day 8, the subject received a blood transfusion and a pleural drainage which was 
effective. The subject completed IV ceftaroline on Study Day 14: however, she still required antibiotics 
and was switched to amoxicillin-clavulanate. She went on to develop an empyema and required a 
thoracic surgical procedure (decortication). She ultimately was discharged from the hospital on Study 
Day 34. 
Assessor’s comment 
Efficacy results are descriptive and limited to small patient numbers, by only one diagnosis (CAP) and 
one microorganism (S. pneumoniae).  
In addition, the paediatric CAP study P903-31 included only 2 patients who received ceftaroline. 
Neither of these patients in ceftaroline group were clinically cured compared to 1 patient in the 
ceftriaxone group. The low number of paediatric bacteraemic SP CAP patients is not surprising 
(Medicine (Baltimore). 2017 Jun; 96(22): e7028)13 and may reflect the low yield of blood cultures in 
these patients or it may have occurred by chance.  
The overall data is insufficient to conclude that ceftaroline is efficacious in both paediatric and adult 
bacteraemic SP CAP patients. In addition, the MAH has not provided data on CAP bacteraemia cases 
caused by other microorganisms.

EMA/659440/2020 
 
  
 
 
4.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The MAH presents a type 2 variation to extend marketing authorisation of CAP to bacteraemic SP CAP. 
The need for this extension is not clear as current indication is broad enough and does not specify 
whether it is bacteraemic or non-bacteraemic CAP. What is not covered by current indication is 
pneumococcal bacteraemia without source, the disease that is characteristic for S. pneumoniae and is 
mostly seen in children. It is assessors’ understanding that the applicant has not provided sufficient 
evidence to extend indication to pneumococcal bacteraemia. 
The applicant has not conducted specific studies to extend already existing indication to bacteraemic 
SP CAP. The post-hoc analysis of already submitted data was performed and in total of 31 adult 
patients and 4 paediatric patients with pneumococcal CAP and bacteraemia were identified and 
included into this analysis. These patients were compared with those who had pneumococcal 
pneumonia (mostly defined by urinary antigen test or by sputum cultures) without bacteraemia. The 
analysis was performed for each study separately and then also as pooled analysis of two adult 
studies. Paediatric study was analysed separately. There was no formal statistical analysis and the 
primary endpoint was clinical cure of CAP. According to the protocol the blood cultures had to be taken 
in all patients at baseline and then repeated in those with positive cultures until cultures turn negative.  
The adult studies showed that in terms of main endpoints (clinical cure of CAP in mMITTE population) 
the response rate was numerically higher in those with non-bacteraemic as compared to bacteraemic-
CAP (78.9% vs 88.0% in ceftaroline and 66.7% vs 69.0% in ceftriaxone arm). The response was 
numerically slightly better in patients treated with ceftaroline as compared to ceftriaxone. Similar 
trends were seen in ME population. In terms of resolution of bacteraemia vast majority of patients 
were categorised into presumed eradication category which makes assessor to believe that repeated 
blood cultures as suggested in the protocol were not taken. The findings that patients with bacteraemic 
and non-bacteraemic  SP CAP have similar response is consistent with recent studies (REF). In terms 
of PORT classes it was not surprising that number of patients with PORT III was smaller in bacteraemic 
patients as compared with non-bacteraemic patients. In patients of PORT IV the clinical response was 
again numerically higher in non-bacteraemic patients treated with ceftaroline while no such differences 
were observed in those treated with ceftriaxone. Small numbers should be noted, however. 
Among paediatric patients only two in ceftaroline group had pneumococcal CAP with bacteraemia and 
another two were in ceftriaxone group. Both ceftaroline treated patients had clinical outcome assessed 
as failure. The numbers were too small to consider these results as conclusive. 
In conclusion, patients with SP bacteraemic CAP were assessed during the post-hoc analysis in terms 
of CAP and not on resolution of bacteraemia. These data in 31 patients show that that clinical cure rate 
was similar in bacteraemic and non-bacteraemic patients with CAP as expected. There is no need to 
extend or specify current indication of CAP to bacteraemic SP CAP as current indication is broad and 
unspecific and thus covers non-bacteraemic as well as bacteraemic CAP. Furthermore the data are 
insufficient to recommend using of ceftaroline in patients with pneumococcal bacteraemia when CAP 
(or any other site of infection) is suspected. As mentioned above S. pneumoniae bacteraemia can also 
occur without clear source of infection in children and data are too limited to extend indication to 
pneumococcal bacteraemia. 
4.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
This submission presents evidence in support of an extension of indication to include the addition of 
secondary bacteraemia in community acquired pneumonia (CAP) due to Streptococcus pneumoniae

(SP). 
This Summary of Clinical Safety (SCS) presents: 
•  A summary of pooled safety data for a sub-population of adult patients with SP bacteraemia 
associated with CAP from two Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, comparative 
studies with ceftaroline versus ceftriaxone; FOCUS 1 (Study P903-08) and FOCUS 2 (Study 
P903-09). 
•  A descriptive summary of safety data for bacteraemic patients from one paediatric CAP study 
(Study P903-31) 
•  Relevant post-marketing (PM) experience with ceftaroline fosamil for CAP with SP bacteraemia 
The following points summarise the safety of ceftaroline fosamil for the treatment of secondary 
bacteraemia in CAP due to SP: 
• 
• 
 Ceftaroline fosamil at a dose of 600 mg administered as a 1-hour IV infusion every 12 hours 
(q12h) for 5 to 7 days is effective and well tolerated in the treatment of CAP with SP 
bacteraemia. 
 There were no new or unexpected safety findings, the safety profile observed in patients with 
SP bacteraemia associated with CAP being consistent with the known profile for ceftaroline 
fosamil as therapy for CAP in adults. 
Study P903-08 was a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, comparative safety and efficacy 
study of intravenous (IV) ceftaroline fosamil versus IV ceftriaxone for 5 to 7 days for treatment of 
adults with CAP. All patients also received two doses of oral adjunctive therapy (clarithromycin) 
starting on Day 1 following randomisation. 
Study P903-09 was a Phase 3, multicentre, randomised, double-blind, comparative safety and efficacy 
study of IV ceftaroline fosamil versus IV ceftriaxone administered for 5 to 7 days for treatment of 
adults with CAP. 
Safety was evaluated in two pooled subpopulations from the above studies: a subset of the 
Microbiological Modified Intent-to-Treat Efficacy (mMITTE) population and Microbiologically Evaluable 
(ME) population, consisting of only those patients with CAP due to SP, with or without concomitant 
bacteraemia. 
• 
• 
 mMITTE population - all randomised patients who receive any amount of study drug, who 
were classified as PORT Risk Class III or IV, and who had at least one typical bacterial 
organism consistent with a CAP pathogen identified from an appropriate microbiological 
specimen (eg, blood, sputum, or pleural fluid). Patients with Mycoplasma pneumoniae or 
Chlamydophila pneumoniae as the sole causative pathogen of infection, and all patients with 
Legionella pneumophila infection were excluded from the mMITTE population. 
 ME population - a subset of the mMITTE subpopulation, who met minimal disease criteria for 
CAP and all evaluability criteria, including patients who received at least the prespecified 
minimal amount of the intended dose and duration of study drug therapy, for whom sufficient 
information regarding the infection was available to determine the patient’s outcome. The ME 
population is a subset of the clinically evaluable (CE) and mMITTE populations and included 
patients in the CE population who also had at least one “typical” bacterial pathogen that has 
been isolated from an appropriate microbiological specimen. 
The primary objective of the pooled analysis presented in this SCS was to evaluate the safety of 
ceftaroline in a subpopulation of adult CAP patients with SP bacteraemia. 
Patient exposure 
Summary statistics for safety data will be provided and are limited by patient numbers.

Safety data were comparable between the mMITTE and ME subpopulations.  
Of the 139 pneumococcal CAP patients included in the pooled safety analysis, 31 (22.3%) had 
associated bacteraemia. The proportion of patients with bacteraemia was comparable between the two 
studies, with a higher proportion in the ceftaroline-treatment groups. These proportions were 
comparable for the ME population. 
Table 5.5.1. Summary of All Patients with S. pneumoniae Associated with Bacteraemia by 
Each Study in the mMITTE Population 
Exposure to ceftaroline or comparator was comparable between drug treatment groups and between 
populations with and without bacteraemia, with a median duration of treatment of 7 days. 
According to the Table 5.5.2, over 90% of patients received study drug for the protocol-specified 5 to 7 
days. Six (6) patients (6/139, 4.3%) received study drug for less than 5 days. The extent of exposure 
was comparable for the ME subpopulation.

Demographic and Other Characteristics of Study Population 
Table 5.5.3. Demographic and Baseline Characteristics in the mMITTE Population for 
Patients with Bacteraemic SP CAP Versus Non-Bacteraemic SP CAP 
Across the mMITTE subpopulation, most patients were male (90/139, 64.7%) and white (132/139, 
95.0%) with a median age ranging from 63 to 66 years. Age and race demographics were comparable 
between bacteraemic and non-bacteraemic populations and between drug treatment groups. 
Within the bacteraemic population, there was a lower proportion of males in the ceftaroline treatment 
group (63.2%) versus the ceftriaxone treatment group (83.3%). Demographic and baseline 
characteristics were comparable for the ME subpopulation.

Baseline risk factors and markers of disease severity are summarised in Table 5.5.4. 
Over 40% (64/139) of patients had relevant medical history. This was lower in the ceftaroline 
treatment group compared to the ceftriaxone treatment group in both the bacteraemic (31.6% versus 
41.7%) and non-bacteraemic (44.0% versus 53.4%) populations and was most commonly structural 
lung disease (42/139, 30.2%). 
The bacteraemic population presented with a higher occurrence of smoking history compared to the 
non-bacteraemic population (67.7% versus 56.5%). The proportion of patients with a history of 
smoking was lower in the ceftaroline treatment group compared to the ceftriaxone treatment group in 
both the bacteraemic (63.2% versus 75.0%) and non-bacteraemic (50.0% versus 62.1%) populations. 
For certain baseline characteristics and markers of disease severity, the bacteraemic population were 
classified as more severe: 
•  More than half of all patients (94/139, 67.6%) had renal impairment (CrCl <80mL/min). 
A higher proportion of bacteraemic patients had moderate renal impairment compared to non-
bacteraemic patients (38.7% versus 21.3%). This was higher in the ceftriaxone-treated 
bacteraemic group compared to the ceftaroline-treated bacteraemic group (50.0% versus 
31.6%). 
•  A higher proportion of bacteraemic patients were classified as PORT Risk Class IV compared to 
non-bacteraemic patients (74.2% versus 41.7%) 
The proportion was highest for the ceftaroline-treated bacteraemic group (78.9%). 
•  A higher proportion of bacteraemic patients were classified in CURB classes 2 and 3 compared 
to non-bacteraemic patients (58.1% versus 35.2%). 
•  A higher proportion of patients with bacteraemia had fever compared to non-bacteraemic 
patients (38.7% versus 27.8%). 
These baseline risk factors and markers of disease severity were comparable for the ME subpopulation. 
The microbiological parameters for the mMITTE population are presented in Table 5.5.5. Most patients 
had typical pathogens that were mono-microbial infections, and this was comparable between the 
bacteraemic and non-bacteraemic populations, and between drug treatment groups. These 
microbiological parameters were comparable for the ME subpopulation.

Assessor’s comment:  
The Applicant has included to the pooled safety analysis 139 Streptococcus pneumoniae CAP patients 
from studies P903-08 and P903-09; and 31 of them had bacteraemia. The higher proportion of 
patients was in ceftaroline treatment groups. Overall, the number of patients is too low to provide any 
specific safety data in this subgroup.  
Provided subgroup data does not change the benefit-risk profile of ceftaroline. 
Adverse events 
A total of 69/139 patients (49.6%) reported any treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) during the 
study period, of which 29/139 (20.9%) were study drug related. 
The ceftaroline-treated bacteraemic group reported a higher proportion of TEAEs (57.9% versus 
36.0%) and drug-related TEAEs (21.1% versus 12.0%) compared with the ceftaroline-treated non-
bacteraemic group. This is likely related to the more severe baseline characteristics and markers of 
disease severity in this subpopulation of patients. 
Overall, the two ceftriaxone treatment groups (bacteraemic and non-bacteraemic combined) reported 
a higher proportion of TEAEs (57.1% versus 42.0%) and drug-related TEAEs (27.1% versus 14.5%) 
compared to the two ceftaroline treatment groups. 
SAEs were reported for 19/139 (13.7%) of patients. These were comparable between the bacteraemic 
and non-bacteraemic groups (16.1% versus 13.0%), with a higher proportion in the two ceftriaxone 
treatment groups (12/70, 17.1%) compared to the two ceftaroline treatment groups (7/69, 10.1%). 
SAEs were low in the ceftaroline-treated bacteraemic group (10.5%). No SAEs were considered study 
drug related. 
Four (4) patients (2.9%) had treatment discontinued, of which one was considered study drug related 
in the ceftaroline-treated non-bacteraemic group (blood creatine increased). 
Discontinuations due to TEAEs were low and comparable.  
No deaths were reported. Reported AEs and deaths (none) were comparable for the ME subpopulation.

Table 5.5.6. Summary of Adverse Events - mMITTE Population 
Common Adverse Events 
The majority of TEAEs were assessed as mild (39/69, 56.5%) to moderate (25/69, 36.2%) in severity 
and unrelated to study drug. TEAEs were comparable for the ME subpopulation. 
TEAEs were higher in frequency in the ceftaroline-treated bacteraemia group (42.1% mild, 15.8% 
moderate) compared to the ceftaroline-treated non-bacteraemic group (26.0% mild, 10.0% 
moderate). This is likely related to the more severe baseline characteristics and markers of disease 
severity in this sub-population of patients. 
The most common TEAEs being reported by at least 3 patients in any subpopulation or treatment 
group is presented in Table 5.5.7 by System Organ Class (SOC) and Preferred Term (PT). These were: 
nausea, pneumonia, headache and phlebitis. TEAEs were comparable for the ME subpopulation. 
The TEAEs reported are consistent with the known safety profile of ceftaroline fosamil (Zinforo EU 
SmPC). 
Five (5/69, 7.2%) patients had severe TEAEs. All of these occurred in the comparator group, were 
unrelated to drug treatment, and one of which was in the bacteraemia group (pneumonia). The severe 
TEAEs in the non-bacteraemic group were: 1 patient with acute myocardial infarction and hypertensive 
crisis, 1 patient with pneumonia, 1 patient with prostate cancer, and 1 patient with chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths reported in the subpopulation analysis for this study. 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
SAEs were reported for 19/139 (13.7%) of patients and none of these were considered study drug 
related (Table 5.5.6). Two (2) SAEs occurred in the ceftaroline-treated bacteraemic group (10.5%) 
compared to 3 in the ceftriaxone-treated bacteraemic group (25.0%). For the ceftaroline-treated 
bacteraemic group these were: pleural effusion and peripheral ischaemia. For the ceftriaxone-treated 
bacteraemic group these were: multiple myeloma, acute pulmonary oedema and endocarditis, and 
pleural effusion and pneumonia. 
The most frequent SAEs being reported by at least 2 patients in any subpopulation or treatment group 
are shown in Table 5.5.8. These were Infections and Infestations (a lower proportion in the ceftaroline-
treated groups compared to the comparator groups) and Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders (a slightly higher proportion in the bacteraemic group compared to the non-bacteraemic 
group). Reported SAEs were comparable for the ME subpopulation.

discontinued. 
One event that led to discontinuation was considered mild and study drug related in the ceftaroline-
treated non-bacteraemic group (blood creatine increased). 
Three (3) patients discontinued treatment due to SAEs that were not considered drug related. 
One patient was in the ceftaroline-treated bacteraemic group (peripheral ischaemia), one patient was

Table 5.5.9. Incidence of Adverse Events That Led to Discontinuation of Any Study Drug - 
mMITTE Population 
Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
Within the adult bacteraemic SP CAP population, 5 bacteraemic patients in the ceftaroline treatment 
group (5/69, 7.2%) and 1 bacteraemic patient in the ceftriaxone treatment group (1/70, 1.4%) had 
PCS (Potentially clinically significant) vital signs in the mMITTE subpopulation. 
For the ceftaroline treatment group these were: high/low diastolic blood pressure, low heart rate, high 
systolic blood pressure and low systolic blood pressure. For the ceftriaxone treatment group these 
were: low diastolic blood pressure. 
Review of PCS post-baseline laboratory values for selected parameters, and shifts over time, showed 
overall low incidence and no meaningful differences between bacteraemic patients in the two drug 
treatment groups. No safety concerns were identified based on mean values or trends for vital signs 
values. 
Assessor’s comment: 
The most common TEAEs were nausea, pneumonia, headache and phlebitis. These are listed ADRs, 
except of pneumonia, which is the drug indication. In the bacteraemic-group was reported a higher 
proportion of TEAEs and drug-related TEAEs, which is in line with the more severe disease.  
SAEs number was low and no SAEs were considered study drug related.  
Four patients discontinued treatment, but only one was related to study drug (in the ceftaroline-
treated non-bacteraemic group – mild blood creatinine increased, listed ADR of ceftaroline). No deaths 
were reported. Provided subgroup data does not change the benefit-risk profile of ceftaroline. 
Laboratory findings 
Within the adult bacteraemic SP CAP population, 6 bacteraemic patients in the ceftaroline treatment 
group (6/69, 8.7%) and 4 bacteraemic patients in the ceftriaxone treatment group (4/70, 5.7%) had 
PCS post-baseline clinical laboratory values in the mMITTE subpopulation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/659440/2020 
 
  
 
 
 
 
For the ceftaroline treatment group these were: high alkaline phosphatase, high platelet count, low 
haemoglobin, low red blood cell count, high alkaline phosphatase and high GGT, high creatine kinase, 
high GGT and low potassium. 
For the ceftriaxone treatment group these were: low haematocrit, low red blood cell count and low 
potassium, high platelet count, low white blood cell count, and low albumin and low calcium. 
Overall, low incidences of PCS haematology, chemistry, or coagulation laboratory values were 
observed, and no meaningful differences were observed between bacteraemic patients in the two 
treatment groups. Furthermore, no safety issues were identified based on mean values or trends for 
haematology, chemistry, and coagulation values. 
No patient met potential Hy’s law criteria. 
Assessor’s comment: 
No significant safety issues were identified. 
Safety in special populations 
Within the Zinforo paediatric clinical study P903-31 [CAP], a total of 4 patients had positive baseline 
blood cultures for SP. All subsequent data described in this section refers to only these 4 bacteraemic 
patients from Study P903-31. 
Two (2) patients received ceftaroline fosamil, and two (2) patients received the comparator drug 
ceftriaxone. 
A total of 16 TEAEs were reported by 3/4 patients (75.0%, compared to 54.8% of bacteraemic patients 
in the adult subpopulation). Two (2) of these patients were in the ceftaroline treatment group and 1 
patient was in the ceftriaxone treatment group. AEs were generally mild to moderate in severity 
(13/16, 81.3%) and unrelated to study drug. 
Two (2) patients experienced a total of 3 severe TEAEs; 1 patient was in the ceftaroline treatment 
group (infectious pleural effusion), and 1 patient was in the ceftriaxone treatment group 
(thrombocytosis and left lower lob lung thrombus). These TEAEs were considered not treatment 
related; all the events were resolving or resolved by the last study visit. 
No TEAEs were considered treatment related in the ceftaroline treatment group. Within the ceftriaxone 
treatment group, 2 TEAEs (increased alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and increased aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST)) were considered treatment related. 
No AEs led to premature discontinuation of study treatment in this subgroup. 
Three (3) patients in the bacteraemic subgroup experienced a SAE; 2 patients were in the ceftaroline 
treatment group and 1 patient was in the ceftriaxone treatment group. All SAEs were considered 
unrelated to study drug and were resolved by the last study visit.  
In the ceftaroline treatment group, a 4-year-old white female received IV ceftaroline from Study Day 1 
to Study Day 8 and experienced a SAE of moderate gastroenteritis on Study Day 12.  
A 3-year-old white female received IV ceftaroline from Study Day 1 to Study Day 14 and experienced a 
SAE of severe infectious pleural effusion on Study Day 16.  
In the ceftriaxone treatment group, a 4-year-old white male experienced a SAE of severe pulmonary 
thrombosis on Study Day 29.  
There were no deaths in this subset of patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/659440/2020 
 
  
 
 
No bacteraemic patient in the ceftaroline treatment group had PCS laboratory values.  
Safety data in the subset of paediatric patients with SP bacteraemia is very limited. However, no new 
safety findings were identified based on review of 4 paediatric patients (2 in the ceftaroline treatment 
group and 2 in the ceftriaxone treatment group and 2 in the ceftriaxone treatment group) who had 
positive baseline blood cultures for SP in the paediatric clinical studies. 
Assessor’s comment: 
The paediatric patient numbers were too small to make any conclusions. However, there were no 
unexpected safety findings. Provided data does not change the benefit-risk profile of ceftaroline. 
Post marketing experience 
It is estimated that approximately 695,603 patients, equivalent to 13,836 patient-years, were exposed 
to ceftaroline fosamil worldwide since the product was first approved on 29 October 2010 in the US 
(EU approval on 23 August 2012). The method used for calculating patient exposure was consistent 
with that used in aggregate reports. 
The estimated patient exposure is based on worldwide sales of 9,738,444 vials containing 600 mg of 
ceftaroline fosamil and on the assumption that the average dose and duration of treatment is 600 mg 
every 12 hours for 7 days (equals fourteen 600 mg vials) in adults with normal renal function across all 
approved indications. 
The number of vials sold in the US is based on the data provided by Allergan Sales, LLC (sources: 
IQVIA, formerly IMS Health Inc. for patient visits; data available from launch date through March 
2019). The number of vials sold in the EU, Latin America and Rest of the World (ROW) is based on 
actual Pfizer sales data through April 2019. 
Cumulative estimated exposure by region is presented in Table 5.5.10. Cumulative estimated 
exposures by indication, gender and age group, available only for US, are summarised in Table 5.5.11.

Summaries of Post-Marketing Data from the Safety Database 
A cumulative search of post-marketing (PM) AEs in cases reporting use of ceftaroline fosamil for 
secondary bacteraemia in CAP due to SP was conducted through 30 April 2019. 
The safety database was initially searched for ceftaroline fosamil cases reporting the following MedDRA 
v 22.0 PT indications: Streptococcal bacteraemia, Bacteraemia, or Sepsis; 39 cases were retrieved 
from this search. The 39 cases were further reviewed to identify those potentially indicative of 
ceftaroline fosamil use for secondary bacteraemia in CAP due to SP. 
On review, 13 relevant cases were identified, representing 1.6% of the cumulative (801) ceftaroline 
fosamil PM cases received through 30 April 2019: 
•  1 case reported the use of ceftaroline fosamil in a patient with severe streptococcal pneumonia 
complicated with bacteraemia; 
•  12 cases in which the pathogen was not clearly identified and bacteraemia due to pneumonia 
could not be excluded – these patients were conservatively included in the analysis. 
Detailed case level characteristics of the relevant PM cases are summarised in Table 5.5.12. Medical 
history, co-suspect and concomitant medications were not reported in these cases.

Table 5.5.13. MedDRA Preferred Terms Reported in Cases Indicative of Use for Secondary 
Bacteraemia in CAP due to Streptococcus pneumoniae 
In 10 out of 13 cases, only off label use terms were reported. In the remaining 3 cases, the patients 
experienced a total of 4 AEs: Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, Neutropenia, 
Rash and Condition aggravated (1 each). The reported AEs are consistent with information included in 
the ceftaroline fosamil EU SmPC. 
The PT Condition aggravated was reported for a 54-year-old female patient who was diagnosed with 
severe streptococcal pneumonia complicated with bacteraemia. She initially responded to treatment 
with ceftaroline fosamil 600 mg bid; subsequently, at unspecified time after starting ceftaroline 
fosamil, her condition deteriorated, presenting with low blood pressure. Ceftaroline fosamil was 
continued and her condition improved again on the third day after admission to the intensive care unit, 
following treatment with unspecified inotropes and intravenous human immunoglobulin. 
Limited information is available concerning the remaining 2 patients who developed AEs while receiving 
ceftaroline fosamil for bacteraemia of unspecified origin (no pathogen, no indication of previous 
infection) with unspecified duration of therapy: 
•  Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms started approximately 2 weeks after 
initiation of ceftaroline fosamil therapy; ceftaroline fosamil was discontinued at unspecified 
time and the event was resolving at the time of reporting. 
•  Non-serious Rash and Neutropenia occurred with a latency of 37 days and ceftaroline fosamil 
was withdrawn at unspecified time; Neutropenia resolved while the outcome of Rash was 
unknown. 
No new safety concerns regarding the use of ceftaroline fosamil for secondary bacteraemia in CAP due 
to SP have been identified from assessment of these cases. The MAH will continue to review the safety 
of ceftaroline fosamil, including all reports of adverse experiences and will revise the product 
documents if an evaluation of the safety data yields significant new information. 
Assessor’s comment: 
The case of drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms concerns bacteraemia of 
unspecified origin. DRESS is not listed. 
Conclusions of Post Marketing Safety Analysis 
Assessment report  
EMA/659440/2020 
 
  
 
 
 
Based upon routine post-marketing pharmacovigilance monitoring there are no new emerging safety 
concerns identified in this dataset and the benefit/risk profile of ceftaroline fosamil remains favourable. 
Assessor’s comment: 
No new safety concerns were identified; however the number of patients with bacteraemic SP CAP was 
extremely low to draw any conclusions. 
4.5.1.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The Applicant has included to the pooled safety analysis 139 Streptococcus pneumoniae CAP patients 
from studies P903-08 and P903-09; and 31 of them had with bacteraemia. The higher proportion of 
patients was in the ceftaroline treatment groups. Overall, the number of patients is too low to provide 
any specific safety data in this subgroup.  
The paediatric patient numbers were too small to make any conclusions (4 in total, 2 on ceftaroline 
and 2 on ceftriaxone group).  
There were no unexpected safety findings.  
Provided data does not change the benefit-risk profile of ceftaroline. 
4.5.2.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
5.  Changes to the Product Information 
The initial proposal to update the wording in section 4.1 has been withdrawn. The Applicant proposal 
that bacteraemia information be included in section 5.1 is not supported as the sub-analysis data 
provided by MAH is not considered to provide further scientific value or guidance to prescribers and 
therefore not in accordance with the SmPC guideline which refers to 'exceptional cases' where the 
secondary or post-hoc analyses could be included in the SmPC when these are of sufficient relevance 
to prescribers (Section 5.1, page 20, https://ec.europa.eu/health//sites/health/files/files/eudralex/vol-
2/c/smpc_guideline_rev2_en.pdf) - in particular given that the current broad indication is already 
understood to include patients with bacteraemia. No changes are therefore proposed to the product 
information. 
Assessor`s comment 
In their comments in the first round, the CHMP members pointed out to the current regulatory practice 
of not including information about bacteraemia under sections 4.1. or 5.1 of the SmPC unless 
information from the secondary analysis is of high importance to guide usage, mainly identifying 
specific concerns. The Rapporteur agrees that the proposed update of section 5.1. is not sufficiently 
justified in light of the SmPC guideline. Current labelling supports the use of Zinforo in cases of 
secondary bacteraemia without any need for subsequent revision of SmPC and there are no concerns 
that need to be reflected in the SmPC in this regard. 
5.1.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package

leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. However, the changes to the package leaflet are minimal and 
do not require user consultation with target patient groups. 
6.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
6.1.  Therapeutic Context 
6.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applicant is seeking to extend the indication to CAP with bacteraemia (also called invasive 
pneumonia in the literature) caused by S. pneumoniae. CAP with bacteraemia occurs in 20-30% of 
adult patients and in about 1-7% of paediatric patients. Although there are no specific treatment 
guidelines for treatment of invasive pneumococcal pneumonia similar antibiotic regimens as for non-
invasive pneumonia are recommended and include beta-lactam +/- macrolide. While monotherapy 
may be recommended for non-invasive CAP for invasive CAP experts tend to suggest combination 
therapy. The data whether CAP with bacteraemia has different outcome than CAP without bacteraemia 
is still debatable. It is characteristic of S. pneumoniae that it may cause pneumococcal disease 
(bacteraemia) without known site of infection, especially in children. 
6.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
See 7.1.1. 
6.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The applicant has not conducted any specific studies to extend already existing indication of CAP. The 
existing indication is broad and covers all microorganisms and does not exclude patients with 
bacteraemia. The post hoc analysis of already submitted studies (adult studies PO903-08, PO903-09 
and paediatric study PO903-31) was performed and in total 31 adult patients and 4 paediatric patients 
with pneumococcal CAP and bacteraemia were identified and included into this analysis. These patients 
were compared with those who had pneumococcal pneumonia (most defined by urinary antigen test or 
by sputum cultures) without bacteraemia. The analysis was performed for each study separately and 
then also as pooled analysis of two adult studies. Paediatric study was analysed separately. There was 
no formal statistical analysis and the primary endpoint was clinical cure of CAP. According to the 
protocol the blood cultures had to be taken in all patients at baseline and then repeated in those with 
positive cultures until cultures turn negative.  
6.2.  Favourable effects 
The adult studies showed that in terms of main endpoints (clinical cure of CAP in mMITTE population 
and in pooled analysis) the response was numerically slightly higher in those with non-bacteraemic as 
compared to bacteraemic CAP (78.9% vs 88.0% in ceftaroline and 66.7% vs 69.0% in ceftriaxone 
arm). The response was also numerically higher in patients treated with ceftaroline as compared to 
ceftriaxone. Similar trends were seen in in ME population. In terms of resolution of bacteraemia vast 
majority of patients were categorised into presumed eradication category, which makes assessor to 
believe that repeated blood cultures, as suggested in the protocol, were not taken. The findings that 
patients with bacteraemic and non-bacteraemic SP CAP have similar response are consistent with 
recent studies (REF). In terms of PORT classification it was not surprising that number of patients with 
PORT III was smaller in bacteraemic patients as compared with non-bacteraemic patients. In patients 
of PORT IV the clinical response was again numerically higher in non-bacteraemic patients treated with 
Assessment report  
EMA/659440/2020 
 
  
 
 
ceftaroline while no such differences were observed in those treated with ceftriaxone. Small numbers 
should be noted, however. 
In paediatric study only two patients treated with ceftaroline had pneumococcal CAP with bacteraemia 
and another two were treated with ceftriaxone. The low percentage of bacteraemic patients is in line 
with other studies that also have shown low rate of bacteraemic children with CAP. Both ceftaroline 
treated patients had clinical outcome assessed as failure. The numbers were too small to be 
conclusive. 
No new safety concerns were identified. 
6.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There is no need to extend current indication of CAP to bacteraemic SP CAP as current indication is 
unspecific and thus already covers non-bacteraemic as well as bacteraemic CAP.  
Studies were not designed to compare bacteraemic CAP to non-bacteraemic. As a result, the number 
of patients with CAP and bacteraemia was small – in total of 31 adults (19 received ceftaroline fosamil) 
and 4 children (2 received ceftaroline fosamil). Thus no adequate conclusions can be drawn. 
The data are insufficient of using ceftaroline in patients with pneumococcal bacteraemia when CAP (or 
any other site of infection) is only suspected and not confirmed. Bacteraemia without clear site of 
infection is characteristic to pneumococci and occurs mostly in children. There is a risk that if 
bacteraemia is mentioned in the label the SPC will be misinterpreted and ceftaroline will be used for 
paediatric patients without confirmed CAP. The efficacy of ceftaroline in invasive pneumococcal disease 
has not been demonstrated and needs further studies. The fact that both bacteraemic children treated 
with ceftaroline had failure outcome is of concern, but due to very small patient numbers these results 
are inconclusive. 
The studied outcome was the one for CAP and not designed to look specifically resolution of 
bacteraemia. Although one could speculated, that these two outcomes match, the time of bacterial 
clearance should have been reported, as it is likely that longer duration of bacteraemia results in worse 
outcome. It is assessor’s speculation that repeated blood cultures as defined in the protocol were not 
taken. 
6.4.  Unfavourable effects 
There were bacteraemic children and both had failure outcome. However, these results cannot be 
considered conclusive because the number of patients was very small.  
6.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
See above. 
6.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
6.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The applicant is seeking for specifying current label of ceftaroline indicated for treatment of CAP to CAP 
with bacteraemia caused by S. pneumoniae. The reason behind this change is not clear as current label 
is not specific and thus CAP patients with bacteraemia or without are already covered. In addition it is 
noted that the Draft of the “Guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products indicated for treatment 
of bacterial infections, Rev. 3” states that for pathogen-specific bacteraemia, it is not considered that 
Assessment report  
EMA/659440/2020 
 
  
 
 
an indication for treatment of bacteraemia can be substantiated by a trial that enrols patients with 
bacteraemia due to a specific pathogen regardless of the primary focus of infection. Such trials are not 
recommended because i) most patients will be treated for a site-specific infection, whether known or 
unknown, with associated bacteraemia and the outcome will be related to source control and ii) the 
trial will not be designed or powered to assess efficacy in sub-groups defined by primary foci or 
unknown source. 
6.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit-risk balance of Zinforo in its approved indication remains unchanged and the CHMP is of 
the opinion that the current product information supports the use of Zinforo in the treatment of 
patients with CSTTI / CAP with concurrent bacteraemia. 
6.7.  Conclusions 
The benefit-risk balance of Zinforo in its approved indication remains unchanged and the CHMP is of 
the opinion that the current product information supports the use of Zinforo in the treatment of 
patients with CSTTI / CAP with concurrent bacteraemia. 
According to the responses submitted, the applicant agreed not to change the current wording in 
section 4.1 and proposed to update section 5.1 to reflect the current knowledge in the treatment of 
patients with secondary bacteraemia. However, following assessment of the submitted data, the CHMP 
does not consider that the sub-analysis data submitted by MAH provides further scientific value or 
guidance to prescribers and is therefore not in accordance with the SmPC guideline which refers to 
'exceptional cases' where the secondary or post-hoc analyses could be included in the SmPC when 
these are of sufficient relevance to prescribers (Section 5.1, page 20, 
https://ec.europa.eu/health//sites/health/files/files/eudralex/vol-2/c/smpc_guideline_rev2_en.pdf) - in 
particular given that the current broad indication is already understood to include patients with 
bacteraemia. This is maintained as a Major Objection. 
7.  3rd CHMP Request for Supplementary Information to be 
addressed in an Oral Explanation  
Major objection 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the current product information supports the use of Zinforo in the 
treatment of patients with CSTTI / CAP with concurrent bacteraemia. Sub-analysis data submitted by 
the MAH however was not considered to provide further scientific value or guidance to prescribers to 
justify the proposed amendment of the product information.  
The MAH is therefore invited to an oral explanation to further justify how the data submitted supports 
the proposed amendments to the product information, particularly given that the current indication, 
together with information in Section 4.4 on any safety concerns and the current information in 5.1, is 
considered by the CHMP to adequately support the use of Zinforo in a broad indication which does not 
exclude bacteraemia.

8.  Rapporteur assessment of the MAH responses to the 1st 
Request for Supplementary Information  
Major objections 
Clinical efficacy aspects  
Question  
1.  The applicant is seeking to extend the indication to CAP with concurrent bacteraemia (also 
called invasive pneumonia in the literature) caused by S. pneumoniae for all age groups. 
Current label of ceftaroline fosamil (Zinforo) states that Zinforo is indicated for the treatment 
of complicated skin and soft tissue infections and community-acquired pneumonia in neonates, 
infants, children, adolescents and adults. As this CAP indication is broad and both invasive 
(with bacteraemia) and non-invasive CAP caused by any microorganisms are already covered, 
the proposal for singling out one microorganism in one site of infection is not justified 
considering the clinical aspects and is not in line with the current guidelines and principles for 
the treatment of bacterial infections. In addition, there is a risk that ceftaroline could be 
promoted for patients with bacteraemia without clear CAP (e.g. suspected CAP) and thus be 
used in cases in which there are very limited data. Use of ceftaroline in paediatric patients with 
bacteraemia is even less clear as both patients in paediatric study failed. Considering these 
issues, the applicant should justify the proposed extension of indication 
Summary of MAH answer  
The MAH agrees that available clinical data support the broader bacteraemia indication compared to 
what was initially submitted in the Type II variation seeking only an extension of the CAP indication to 
include patients with concurrent SP bacteraemia.  
The MAH's preferred position to address the major objection would be to add bacteraemia text to 
Section 4.1 of the Zinforo EU Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), the same as what has been 
included recently for the Vaborem SmPC. However, following receipt of the Rapporteur’s Preliminary 
Assessment Report and the 27 March 2020 teleconference with EMA representatives and Rapporteurs, 
the MAH understands that the EMA believe including bacteraemia text in Section 4.1 of the SmPC is 
not necessary. Therefore, in the absence of any text related to bacteraemia in the European Public 
Assessment Report (EPAR) and current SmPC, the MAH proposes adding text to Section 5.1 of the 
SmPC to clarify Zinforo use in the treatment of patients with bacteraemia associated with cSSTI/CAP 
from the Phase 3 clinical trials. 
The current Zinforo SmPC or EPAR does not provide healthcare professionals (HCPs) with a 
confirmation that this product is suitable for cases with concurrent bacteraemia. In addition, the SmPC 
does not provide details on Phase 3 studies. Whilst the MAH understands that the EMA’s preference is 
to not include bacteraemia text in line with the antibacterial guideline, HCPs may not be aware of the 
regulatory requirements. Specifically, the Zinforo EPAR does not add details on bacteraemic patients, it 
only provides fragmented data, mostly on S. pneumoniae efficacy from Studies P903-08 and P903-09 
being reported. As some other available antibiotics have additional wording regarding bacteraemia, 
this may create confusion for prescribers and may result in situations, whereby patients in which 
positive blood cultures are received after initiation of ceftaroline, may be switched unnecessarily to 
another treatment, or patients not started on ceftaroline if they are known to have secondary 
bacteraemia. 
In fact, the MAH receives a considerable amount of questions from HCPs related to the use of Zinforo 
in bacteraemia through different channels (medical information, sales representatives, customer facing 
Assessment report  
EMA/659440/2020 
 
  
 
 
medical colleagues). As an example, the Medical Information database (including EU countries with the 
United Kingdom, Norway, and Switzerland) recorded 23 enquiries in 2019. This represents 5.72% of 
total for all Zinforo enquiries received in that year. The MAH believes that providing more details from 
pivotal studies on cases of secondary bacteraemia in cSSTI and CAP in the SmPC will support the 
appropriate use of the product. 
Overall Bacteraemia Experience From the Ceftaroline Fosamil Phase 3 Clinical Trials  
The MAH’s initial submission to extend the indication for CAP to include concurrent bacteraemia due to 
SP was limited to Phase 3 clinical data in CAP patients with SP bacteraemia. The MAH performed an 
analysis of clinical data from all patients with concurrent bacteraemia associated with CAP or cSSTI 
from the Phase 3 ceftaroline fosamil development program. The MAH has provided supporting 
documentation for the overall bacteraemic versus non-bacteraemic patients from the previous Phase 3 
studies.  
The number of patients with baseline bacteraemia associated with CAP and cSSTI from the 6 
ceftaroline fosamil Phase 3 studies was analysed. Overall, of the 1976 patients included in the pooled 
analysis, 138 patients had concurrent bacteraemia at baseline, of which 72 were treated with 
ceftaroline fosamil. Although the clinical trials included no randomisation by bacteraemic status at 
baseline, the proportion of CAP/cSSTI patients with bacteraemia was similar across treatment groups.

Demographics and Baseline Characteristics 
Across the mMITT population, most patients were male and White, with a median age ranging from 51 
to 62 years. Age range, sex, and race demographics were generally similar between drug treatment 
groups and between bacteraemic and non-bacteraemic populations, except for mean age, which was 
slightly higher in the bacteraemic group compared to the non-bacteraemic group (57.3 years 
compared to 51.8 years). 
A higher proportion of bacteraemic CAP patients were classified as PORT Risk Class IV compared to 
non-bacteraemic patients (71.7% compared to 30.6%), likely related to the more severe baseline 
characteristics in this subpopulation of patients and expected for a scoring system based on severity of 
illness. Demographic and baseline characteristics were comparable for the ME subpopulation.

When analysed by indication and by study, the clinical cure rates for bacteraemic patients were 
generally similar to comparator, and similar between bacteraemic and non-bacteraemic subgroups and 
with the overall population (both patients with and without bacteraemia). However, efficacy 
conclusions are limited by smaller patient numbers.

Within the CAP indication, clinical cure rates were lower in the bacteraemic subgroups compared to the 
non-bacteraemic subgroups; however, between treatment arms, clinical cure rates were higher in 
ceftaroline-treated patients compared to patients treated with the comparator. Given the small number 
of patients, it is difficult to draw conclusions in this subgroup. 
Table 5: Clinical response at TOC in bacteraemic CAP patients was analysed by PORT Risk 
Class (III and IV). Though the denominators are small, the clinical cure rate for ceftaroline 
and comparator by PORT score was generally similar in the Phase 3 CAP studies.

Clinical response at TOC in the mMITT and ME populations were further analysed by baseline 
pathogen. The predominant baseline pathogens isolated from blood specimens were S. aureus (n=29) 
and S. pneumoniae (n=19). As expected, all S. pneumoniae blood isolates were from CAP patients 
while most S. aureus isolates were from cSSTI patients. All other baseline blood pathogens identified in 
the bacteraemic subgroup were isolated in no more than 6 patients each. Similar clinical cure rates 
were observed in the mMITT and ME populations for the pathogens that were most frequently isolated. 
Clinical cure rates were high for S. aureus (mMITT population: bacteraemic group: 82.8%; non-
bacteraemic group: 86.6%) and S. pneumoniae (mMITT population: bacteraemic group: 78.9%; non-
bacteraemic group: 84.8%) in patients treated with ceftaroline. As expected with small denominators, 
variability was observed by pathogen, but clinical cure rates were broadly similar between treatment 
groups.

Patient-level microbiological response rates at TOC in the mMITT and ME populations were generally 
similar between treatment groups, by indication and across indication. For patients treated with 
ceftaroline, 56/72 (77.8%) bacteraemic patients and 825/966 (85.4%) non-bacteraemic patients had a 
favourable microbiological response at TOC in the mMITT population. 
Per-pathogen microbiological response rates in the mMITT and ME populations were generally similar 
between treatment groups, by indication and across indication, though comparisons are limited by 
small numbers for any given pathogen.  
In bacteraemia patients who achieved negative blood culture, the median time (in days) to first 
negative blood culture was 7 days (range 1-35 days) for patients treated with ceftaroline and 8 days 
(range 1-19 days) for patients treated with comparator.

Overall, bacteraemic patients reported a higher incidence of treatment emergent adverse events 
(TEAEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) than non-bacteraemic patients. This is likely related to the 
more severe baseline characteristics and markers of disease severity in this subpopulation of patients. 
As shown in Table 8 in bacteraemic patients any study drug related TEAEs and SAEs were numerically 
more frequent in ceftaroline as compared with comparator arm patients but small numbers should be 
noted. 
Observed TEAEs were generally in line with the known safety profile of ceftaroline or consistent with 
the underlying indications. The majority of TEAEs were assessed as mild to moderate in severity and 
Assessment report

unrelated to study drug. Within the ceftaroline-treated bacteraemic patients, no preferred term (PT) 
for all-causality TEAEs was reported in more than 4 (5.6%) patients and no PT for treatment-related 
TEAEs was reported in more than 3 (4.2%) patients. Four patients discontinued ceftaroline treatment 
due to a treatment-related TEAE (pruritus/rash generalised; hypersensitivity; clostridial infection; and 
dermatitis allergic) vs one patient is comparator arm. All treatment-related TEAEs in the ceftaroline 
treatment group were resolved.  
The incidence of all-cause SAEs in bacteraemic patients treated with ceftaroline was lower compared to 
bacteraemic patients treated with comparator (13.9% versus 22.7%). The majority of SAEs were 
assessed as moderate in severity across both treatment groups, unrelated to study drug and were 
resolved. Within the ceftaroline-treated bacteraemic patients, no PT for all-causality SAEs was reported 
in more than 1 (1.4%) patient. Three ceftaroline-treated patients reported 1 SAE each that was severe 
in intensity: osteoarthritis, hypersensitivity, and clostridial infection. These 3 SAEs were all resolved; 
however, the latter 2 SAEs were considered related to treatment and led to discontinuation.  
There were no deaths reported in ceftaroline-treated bacteraemic patients.  
Paediatric Patients With Baseline Bacteraemia From the Ceftaroline Fosamil Paediatric cSSTI 
and CAP Clinical Trials 
Efficacy 
There are limited data on efficacy of ceftaroline fosamil in the treatment of paediatric patients (aged 2 
months to <18 years) with bacteraemia associated with cSSTI or CAP from the ceftaroline fosamil 
paediatric clinical trials. The MAH’s original bacteraemia submission included a summary of 4 patients 
(2 ceftaroline, 2 ceftriaxone) with confirmed SP bacteraemia who were enrolled in Study P903-31 
(Paediatric CAP Study).    
Across the paediatric studies comprising the ceftaroline fosamil development program, a total of 9 
paediatric patients in the mMITT population had a positive baseline blood culture, identified as a typical 
pathogen. Baseline blood pathogens were as follows: SP – 6 patients; MRSA – 1 patient; MSSA – 1 
patient; E. coli – 1 patient. Two (2) patients with SP bacteraemia were treated with comparator; the 
remaining 7 bacteraemia patients were treated with ceftaroline fosamil. Clinical response rates (Clinical 
cure) at TOC in the paediatric bacteraemia subgroup were 57.1%. However, the patient numbers are 
too small to draw any efficacy conclusions.

The low number of paediatric patients with baseline bacteraemia enrolled in the ceftaroline fosamil 
paediatric studies may reflect low yield of blood cultures in these young patients or it may have 
occurred by chance. It is plausible, however, to extrapolate efficacy observed in adults with 
bacteraemia associated with cSSTI or CAP to the paediatric population, using the same rationale for 
Assessment report  
EMA/659440/2020 
 
  
 
 
 
 
extrapolation of efficacy for the approved indications of cSSTI and CAP. The pathophysiology of 
bacteraemia associated with cSSTI/CAP is similar between adult and paediatric patients. The minimum 
inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of pathogens collected from clinical trials and surveillance programs 
are similar in adults and paediatric patients. Furthermore, Zinforo’s mechanism of action targets the 
pathogen rather than human receptors/physiology; therefore, pharmacokinetic/ pharmacodynamic 
(PK/PD) targets are the same for both adult and paediatric patients. A robust population PK/PD model 
based on adult and paediatric clinical trial data was developed and supported the approved dosing 
regimens for treatment of cSSTI and CAP.    
Safety 
Within the ceftaroline fosamil paediatric multiple-dose clinical trials, a total of 9 patients had positive 
baseline blood cultures with an identified pathogen. Seven (77.8%) patients received ceftaroline, and 2 
(22.2%) patients received the comparator drug.  
Overall, a total of 26 TEAEs were reported by 4/9 (44.4%) patients. AEs were generally mild to 
moderate in severity (21/26, 80.8%) and unrelated to study drug.  
For patients treated with ceftaroline, 3 patients each experienced 1 SAE (gastroenteritis, infectious 
pleural effusion, and pulmonary thrombosis); all events were assessed as not related and resolved. 
Only 1 patient within the ceftaroline treatment group was reported to have a treatment related AE; the 
severe, non-serious events of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased and alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) increased starting on study Day 8 led to discontinuation of study treatment 
and were later resolved. Within ceftaroline-treated patients, no other AEs led to discontinuation of 
study treatment. There were no deaths in this subset of bacteraemic patients. 
Safety data in the subset of paediatric patients with concurrent baseline bacteraemia are very limited. 
However, no new safety findings were identified based on review of the 9 paediatric patients with 
positive baseline blood cultures from the paediatric clinical studies. 
In conclusion, the MAH claims that there have been a considerable number of questions from HCPs 
related to efficacy and availability of clinical trials data of Zinforo in bacteraemic patients. In the 
absence of bacteraemia text in clinical trial section of the EPAR, the MAH proposes to add the following 
summary text to the end of Section 5.1 of the SmPC to clarify concurrent bacteraemia experience from 
Zinforo clinical trials: 
“Clinical efficacy in case of concurrent bacteraemia 
A limited number of patients with concurrent bacteraemia were enrolled in clinical trials for the 
indications of complicated skin and soft tissue infections and community-acquired pneumonia. Among 
6 adult studies, 85/1361 (6.2%) patients with cSSTI, and 53/477 (11.1%) patients with CAP were 
bacteraemic at baseline (mMITT population). The most commonly isolated pathogens in Zinforo-
treated patients with concurrent bacteraemia and cSSTI or CAP were Staphylococcus aureus and 
Streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively. Overall, clinical cure rates in patients with concurrent 
bacteraemia who received Zinforo treatment were comparable to those seen in the comparator group 
as well as in the overall population for the respective indications of CAP and cSSTI.” 
Rapporteur Assessment 
In the submitted responses the applicant has now changed the position and is not seeking extension of 
indication for the treatment of community acquired pneumonia (CAP) to include concurrent 
bacteraemia due to Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP) for all age groups. This is in line with both the 
view of the CHMP as well as the IDWP (Infection disease working party), that it is evident that Zinforo 
can be used for secondary bacteraemia without any additional revision on the wording in section 4.1. 
Assessment report  
EMA/659440/2020 
 
  
 
 
The MAH has provided supporting documentation for the bacteraemic versus non-bacteraemic patients 
regardless of condition or infecting organism from the previous Phase 3 studies. 
As a response to major objection the MAH proposes an update of section 5.1 of the SmPC to include 
data about bacteraemia associated with cSSTI/CAP regardless of infecting organism.  
In total, there were 138 patients (72 ceftaroline-treated) with bacteraemia associated with CAP/cSSTI 
from six Phase 3 clinical trials. Efficacy results are descriptive and limited by small patient numbers. In 
general clinical response in patients with bacteraemia was lower than in those without but response 
(clinical cure) in patients treated with ceftaroline vs comparator was largely similar as expected with 
small denominators, variability was observed by pathogen and within indications.  
As regards to safety data, the observed TEAEs were in line with the known safety profile of ceftaroline. 
Bacteraemic patients had more TEAEs and SAEs than non-bacteraemic patients. Treatment related AE 
and SAEs were numerically more common in patients treated with ceftaroline than with comparator. 
The majority of TEAEs were assessed as mild to moderate in severity and unrelated to study drug. No 
deaths were reported in ceftaroline-treated patients with bacteraemia. The most common related 
TEAEs’ SOCs within the ceftaroline-treated bacteraemic adult patients were gastrointestinal disorders 5 
(6.9%), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 4 (5.6%), nervous system disorders 3 (4.2%) and 
vascular disorders 3 (4.2%). The most common related TEAE PTs within the ceftaroline-treated 
bacteraemic adult patients were Phlebitis 3 (4.2%), Rash 2 (2.8%) and Headache 2 (2.8%). There 
were no new safety findings during this analysis. 
The subset of paediatric patients with concurrent baseline bacteraemia was too limited, to draw any 
conclusions.  
Similar to initial comments current label does not prevent using ceftaroline in patients with 
concomitant bacteraemia. The MAH, however, argues that prescribers are interested in efficacy of 
ceftaroline in patients with concomitant bacteraemia. The analyses provided by the MAH are not 
considered to provide sufficient value to justify the amendment of Section 5.1, given that the current 
indication, together with information in Section 4.4 on any safety concerns and the current information 
in 5.1, is considered by the CHMP to adequately reflect the use of Zinforo in a broad indication which 
does not exclude bacteraemia. The update of section 5.1 is not considered justified and cannot be 
accepted. 
Conclusion 
The MO is partially resolved with the applicant not pursuing the extension of the indication regarding 
CAP.  
However, the proposal to update section 5.1 of the SmPC to include information regarding bacteraemia 
is not supported by the Rapporteur and this is maintained as an MO. 
Other concerns 
Clinical efficacy aspects  
Question 2 
The MAH should clarify the microbiological outcome of the bacteraemic patients in the studies P903-08 
and P903-09 (the eradication day, including Day 1, Day 2; Day 3; Days 4-6; EOT; TOC or LFU) and 
specify the meaning of “Presumed eradication” (only clinical cure or eradication before TOC already). 
Assessment report  
EMA/659440/2020 
 
  
 
 
 
The MAH should submit the microbiological data of eradication stratified by day (P903-08 and P903-
09).   
Summary of MAH answer  
In Studies P903-08 and P903-09, the per-patient and per-pathogen microbiological outcomes at TOC 
in the mMITTE and ME populations were derived programmatically, using electronic data from the 
central laboratory and pathogen information determined by the Sponsor for each baseline isolate. The 
Microbiological Outcome Categories were follows:  
Eradication - an appropriate source specimen (any sample that may yield the growth of a CAP 
pathogen, e.g. blood, respiratory specimens, or pleural fluid) demonstrated absence of the original 
baseline pathogen 
Presumed eradication - an appropriate source specimen was not available to culture, and the 
subject was assessed as a clinical cure 
Persistence - an appropriate source specimen demonstrated continued presence of the original 
baseline pathogen 
Presumed persistence - An appropriate source specimen was not available to culture and the subject 
was assessed as a clinical failure 
Indeterminate - an appropriate source specimen was not available to culture and the subject’s 
clinical response was assessed as indeterminate 
For the special case of pneumococcal infection identified via a urinary antigen test only, the 
microbiological outcome was always presumed from the clinical response, unless a postbaseline 
respiratory culture was positive for S. pneumoniae, in which case the microbiological outcome was 
persistence. For patients with coinfection with an atypical pathogen, the outcome for atypical 
pathogens was presumed from the clinical response, unless serology data at Late Follow-up were 
available. 
The microbiological outcome was determined for a pathogen within a patient and a source (i.e. 
respiratory specimens or blood). If a pathogen was identified from multiple sources, the worst per-
source outcome for that pathogen was used for per-pathogen microbiological outcome. Likewise, if 
multiple pathogens were identified for a patient, the worst per-pathogen outcome for that patient was 
used for per-patient microbiological outcome. The microbiological outcomes at TOC were only 
applicable to patients who were not clinical failures at end of therapy (EOT). Patients who were failures 
at EOT had the corresponding microbiological outcome determined from EOT cultures and carried 
forward to TOC. If no EOT culture was available for patients who were clinical failures at EOT, then the 
microbiological outcome at TOC was presumed persistence. Otherwise, the microbiological outcome at 
TOC was determined from cultures obtained at the TOC window. If no culture was available in the TOC 
window, then the microbiological outcome at TOC was presumed from the clinical response at TOC.  
According to the conservative definitions applied for the microbiological outcome in the 2 studies, when 
no culture was available within the TOC window (8-10 days after stopping study drug), the 
microbiological outcome was presumed from the clinical response. To be considered as presumed 
eradication, the patient’s clinical response must have been clinical cure at TOC. Protocol requirements 
for repeat blood cultures in both protocols were as follows: “Blood for culture was obtained if the 
previous blood culture was positive or if medically indicated. Blood for culture was not obtained at TOC 
if the subject was a failure at EOT”. Patients with a positive blood culture at baseline were required to 
have follow-up cultures at subsequent study visits; however, once the follow-up blood cultures were 
negative, there was no additional requirement for blood cultures to be taken in the TOC window unless 
Assessment report  
EMA/659440/2020 
 
  
 
 
the investigator determined there was a medical need. The majority of patients with baseline blood 
cultures positive for SP had follow-up negative blood cultures taken 1-7 days after baseline (i.e. on 
Study Days 2-8); and therefore, did not require cultures to be drawn during the TOC window according 
to the study protocols. This accounts for the preponderance of microbiological outcomes being 
presumed eradication rather than eradication at TOC.  
For ceftaroline-treated patients with SP bacteraemia, the median time to negative blood culture was 4 
days (range 1-18 days). For comparator-treated patients with SP bacteraemia, the median time to 
negative blood culture was 7 days (range 1-19 days). To further assess the rate at which blood 
cultures became negative in SP bacteraemic patients in Studies P903-08 and P903-09 who achieved 
negative blood culture, a “time-to-negative-culture” analysis was conducted.  
Figure 2: Kaplan-Meier Plot of time to negative blood culture for Streptococcus pneumoniae 
bacteraemia patients (mMITT Population) 
In summary, the preponderance of presumed eradication microbiological outcomes in patients with SP 
bacteraemic who were clinical cures at TOC is the result of the conservative definition for eradication 
which required that a negative blood culture be collected during the narrow TOC window. Because a 
majority of patients achieved negative culture prior to the TOC window (i.e. median of 4 days for 
patients treated with ceftaroline), an additional blood culture was not obtained at TOC, which was in 
line with the protocol requirements and expected in cases where the patient was improving clinically. 
Rapporteur Assessment 
Issue resolved. 
Question 3 
According to the data presented for studies P903-08 and P903-09, with the exception of one patient 
the remaining were marked as “presumed eradication or presumed persistence”. This makes assessor 
to assume that no repeated blood cultures were taken in vast majority of cases despite the 
recommendations given in the protocol. The MAH should clarify this. 
Assessment report  
EMA/659440/2020 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Summary of MAH answer  
As noted in the previous response, protocols for Studies P903-08 and P903-09 specified that follow-up 
blood cultures were to be taken if the previous blood culture was positive or if they were medically 
indicated. Blood cultures were not mandatory at EOT or TOC unless previous blood cultures remained 
positive. A review of microbiological culture results indicates that follow-up blood cultures were taken 
in the majority of SP bacteraemic patients, which was consistent with protocol recommendations. 
Within ceftaroline-treated patients, there were 2 patients for whom post-baseline blood culture data 
are not available: 1 patient was a clinical cure at TOC, and 1 patient was a clinical failure with 
persistent symptoms of community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) at TOC.  
Rapporteur Assessment 
Issue resolved. 
Question 4 
There were 2 patients with infection caused by multiple microorganisms. The MAH should clarify 
whether all these microorganisms were cultured from blood or were they found in different sites. 
Summary of MAH answer  
One patient had both SP and S. aureus isolated from the baseline blood culture; no isolates were 
obtained from other culture sites. A follow-up blood culture taken on Day 8 was negative for both 
pathogens; no additional follow-up blood cultures were obtained. The patient was assessed as a clinical 
cure at both EOT and TOC visits. The per patient response was favourable, and the per pathogen 
microbiological outcome at TOC for both pathogens were presumed eradication.  
One patient had both SP and E. coli isolated from the baseline blood cultures; no isolates were 
obtained from other culture sites. The patient had persistent symptoms of CABP at TOC and was 
considered a clinical failure. The per patient microbiological response was unfavourable. In the absence 
of follow-up blood cultures, the per pathogen microbiological outcome at TOC for both pathogens were 
presumed persistence.

9.  CHMP member comments on the assessment of the 1st RSI 
responses 
MS#1 comment: The rapporteur’s assessment that no revisions are needed to section 4.1 is 
endorsed. Adding clinical data on treatment of bacteraemia to section 5.1 is not endorsed for the 
reasons indicated below. Additionally we have a specific SmPC comment. 
Clinical Efficacy: MS#1 supports the opinion that the current CAP indication already covers treatment 
of patients with secondary bacteraemia and the agreement of the applicant that no revisions are 
needed in section 4.1 is thus endorsed. However the MEB is not convinced that the additional data on 
bacteraemia should be incorporated in section 5.1. 
Assessment report  
EMA/659440/2020 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
According to the draft antibacterial guideline (rev.3), clinical data should only be added to section 5.1 
of the SmPC if considered directly relevant to the approved indications and secondary analyses should 
not usually be included unless the information is of high importance to guide usage.  
As has been previously commented in the discussions on Zemdri (in which the applicant also proposed 
to include clinical data on treatment of patients with cUTI and concurrent bacteraemia in section 5.1 
(EMEA/H/C/004457) extra information in the SmPC on the treatment of patients with concurrent 
bacteraemia is not needed unless there is a concern raised by the data available, in which case this 
concern should be placed in section 4.4. 
Considering the draft antibacterial guideline (rev. 3) and considering previous discussions on Zemdri, 
MS#1 is not convinced that the data on the treatment of bacteraemic patients should be incorporated 
in section 5.1. Firstly, the secondary analyses are not considered to be directly relevant to the 
approved indication of CAP and are not needed to guide use of Zinforo in patients with bacteraemic 
CAP. Secondly, the secondary analysis did not result in specific concerns regarding the treatment of 
bacteraemic patients and if it did raise additional concerns, these should be incorporated in section 
4.4.  
SmPC, PIL, labelling: If the CHMP will allow for the addition of the bacteraemia data to section 5.1, the 
actual numbers of patients treated for bacteraemic CAP with ceftaroline, should be reflected as the 
number of adult bacteraemic SP CAP patients on ceftaroline in pooled analyses was very low – only 19 
adult patients received ceftaroline. 
MS#2 comment: The assessment and conclusions of the Rapporteur is agreed. MS#2 supports the 
opinion that the current wording in section 4.1 of the SmPC already covers the indication of secondary 
bacteraemia (linked to CAP and cSSTI) initially applied for. Thus, the agreement of the Applicant that 
no revisions are needed in section 4.1 is endorsed. 
The update of section 5.1 to include clinical trial data with regard to the treatment of bacteraemia 
linked to CAP and cSSTI with Zinforo is also agreed. This is based on the fact that these data are 
considered of significant relevance and that mentioning of such data is in line with the draft Guideline 
on the evaluation of medicinal products indicated for treatment of bacterial infections, Rev. 3. The 
guideline states that clinical data from efficacy studies might be implemented in section 5.1 of the 
SmPC. Since the proposed wording of section 5.1 is a summary statement of clinical efficacy trials 
relevant to the treatment of bacteraemia linked to CAP and cSSTI including a description on the 
outcome of the trials, the addition is considered in line with the draft guideline and thus acceptable. 
MS#3 comment: The Rapporteur’s assessment that no revisions are needed to section 4.1 is 
endorsed. Adding clinical data on treatment of bacteraemia to section 5.1 is not endorsed for the 
reasons indicated further below.  
SmPC, PL, labelling: In our opinion the design and the conduct of the studies included in this 
application, exclude the possibility for drawing a clear and valuable conclusion on the efficacy of 
ceftaroline in case of bacteraemia.  
The diverging proposals for the amendment to section 5.1 of the SmPC made by the applicant and the 
Rapporteur illustrate this clearly:  
The applicant proposes “Overall, clinical cure rates in patients with concurrent bacteraemia who 
received Zinforo treatment were comparable to those seen in the comparator group as well as in the 
overall population for the respective indications of CAP and cSSTI.”; 
Assessment report 
EMA/659440/2020 
The Rapporteur proposes “The clinical cure rates were lower in bacteraemic patients (76.4% vs 77.3% 
in ceftaroline and comparator group accordingly) compared to the clinical cure rates in non-
bacteraemic patients (85.1% vs 82.2% in ceftaroline and comparator group accordingly).” 
The draft of the “Guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products indicated for treatment of bacterial 
infections, Rev. 3” states that it is not considered that an indication for treatment of bacteraemia can 
be substantiated by a trial that enrols patients with bacteraemia due to a specific pathogen regardless 
of the primary focus of infection. Such trials are not recommended because i) most patients will be 
treated for a site-specific infection, whether known or unknown, with associated bacteraemia and the 
outcome will be related to source control and ii) the trial will not be designed or powered to assess 
efficacy in sub-groups defined by primary foci or unknown source. Regarding Section 5.1 of the SmPC 
the GL states (see below): Secondary analyses should not usually be included unless the information is 
of high importance to guide usage 
Furthermore, we do not find it appropriate to accept the result “presumed eradicated” as a marker for 
positive efficacy (“favorable”) when the diagnosis in concern is bacteraemia. We may need to know 
whether control blood cultures were negative at a well-defined time point.  
Another problem is the use of the word “comparator” instead of the names of the comparators. The 
applicant states in the rationale for the application that he wants to make it easier for the clinicians to 
decide which treatment would be suitable for his patient with bacteraemia. According to the 
Rapporteur’s proposal the clinician would most probably prefer the comparator; however, he will not 
know which product was the comparator. 
A third problem is the paragraph used in both proposals “The most commonly isolated pathogens in 
ceftaroline fosamil-treated patients with concurrent bacteraemia and cSSTI or CAP were 
Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus pneumoniae, respectively.” Why only inform about the most 
commonly isolated pathogens in the ceftaroline group? If the frequencies of the different species differ 
between the two treatment arms, this could theoretically be an explanation for different efficacy in the 
two arms. So, either delete the sentence or add information about the comparator-group. 
MS#4 comment: The conclusion that no revisions are needed to section 4.1 is endorsed. 
As commented during the first round of assessment MS#4 is of the opinion that this “supplement” to 
syndrome-specific indications is redundant. MS#4 considers that it is sufficient that any concerns 
regarding the efficacy in the treatment of patients with a syndrome-specific indication associated with 
bacteraemia are expressed in section 4.4. Unless there are any concerns, no information with regards 
bacteraemia is needed in the SmPC. This has been discussed and agreed by the CHMP in earlier 
procedures (Zemdri). Introducing information with regards subgroup analyses of patients with 
concurrent bacteraemia in section 5.1 will be setting a new precedent. Therefore, MS#4 is of the 
opinion that the paragraph proposed for section 5.1 should be deleted. 
Rapporteur comment: taking into account MSs comments received and the draft antibacterial 
guideline (rev.3), the proposal from the Applicant to update section 5.1 of the SmPC, to include 
statement about bacteraemia associated with cSSTI/CAP, is reconsidered by the Rapporteur and is not 
regarded justified. It is evident from the current SmPC that Zinforo can be used for secondary 
bacteraemia without any additional revision on the wording in sections 4.1 or 5.1.  
Additionally, as observed for Zinforo, in general the clinical response in patients with bacteraemia was 
lower than in those without but response (clinical cure) in patients treated with ceftaroline vs

comparator was largely similar. The secondary analysis did not result in specific concerns regarding the 
treatment of bacteraemic patients, which in any case should be included under section 4.4, as also 
noted in the MSs comments. Therefore this proposal is not following the draft GL where it is stated that 
“Secondary analyses should not usually be included unless the information is of high importance to 
guide usage. “ 
To be in line with the previous approaches of the CHMP for similar cases and acknowledging the 
comments received, Rapporteur considers that in the absence of dedicated studies the proposed 
amendment to section 5.1 not sufficiently justified and not supported and is maintained as an MO. 
Hence the MO raised in the first round is considered as partially resolved.

10.  Rapporteur assessment report of the MAH responses to 
the 2nd Request for Supplementary Information  
Major objections 
Clinical efficacy aspects  
1.  Current labelling supports the use of Zinforo in cases of secondary bacteraemia without any 
need for subsequent revision of SmPC. According to the responses submitted, the applicant 
has agreed not to change current wording in section 4.1 and has proposed to update section 
5.1 to reflect the current knowledge in the treatment of patients with secondary bacteraemia. 
The analyses provided by the MAH are not considered to provide sufficient value to justify the 
amendment of Section 5.1, given that the current indication, together with information in 
Section 4.4 on any safety concerns and the current information in 5.1, is considered by the 
CHMP to adequately reflect the use of Zinforo in a broad indication which does not exclude 
bacteraemia.  
Summary of Applicant’s responses 
The MAH acknowledges the CHMP comments. Secondary bacteraemia occurs in a significant number of 
patients with CAP or cSSTI and may be even more frequent in more severe patients that require 
hospitalisation. Indeed, up to 20% of CAP patients may suffer from concurrent bacteraemia.1 If the 
bacteria involved are under the therapeutic range of Zinforo, these patients may benefit from 
treatment with Zinforo and, therefore, explicitly addressing this within the Product Information (PI) 
would seem “of high importance to guide usage”, and consistent with EMA guidance in the draft 
“Guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products indicated for treatment of bacterial infections, Rev. 
3”2 related to the inclusion of secondary analyses Section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The absence of a concurrent bacteraemia indication or absence of any bacteraemia-related text in the 
PI may lead HCPs to believe that there is not sufficient data to support the use of Zinforo in secondary 
bacteraemia. This misunderstanding may lead to unwanted outcomes, either with patients suitable for 
Zinforo treatment not being started on the drug or being unnecessarily switched to other agents, 
resulting in, as examples: 
1.  Patients being exposed at first instance to regimens with potentially lower efficacy compared to 
Zinforo.  
Zinforo showed excellent efficacy against main pathogens responsible for CAP in its Phase 3 
studies.3 Although the pivotal studies were not planned for demonstrating superiority, Zinforo 
achieved unadjusted clinical cure rate of 85.5% vs. 68.6% in the ceftriaxone group (P = 0.009) in 
the cohort of 139 subjects (69 ceftaroline, 70 ceftriaxone) with confirmed SP CAP. Notably, the 
microbiological response was 87.0% (60/69) and 72.9% (51/70) for ceftaroline and ceftriaxone, 
respectively (P=0.0003)4 
More importantly, ceftriaxone has limited activity against Staphylococcus aureus (SA), which 
seems particularly important in some CAP patients (as in patients with post-influenza CAP).5 
Zinforo has potent activity against SA, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus 
(MRSA) and its clinical efficacy was tested in CAP (excluding patients with MRSA infection), with a 
clinical cure rate of 72% (18/25) vs. 60% (25/30) for ceftriaxone.  
2.  Patients being unnecessarily switched to an alternative antibiotic and thus potentially experiencing 
the adverse events (AEs) of that treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/659440/2020 
 
  
 
 
 
A patient with a cSSTI suspected or documented to be caused by MRSA could be switched to 
vancomycin. There is established evidence of renal toxicities related with vancomycin, especially if 
preventive actions are not taken or the resistance of MRSA leads to increasing the dosage of 
vancomycin.6 However such patients with suspected or confirmed secondary bacteraemia could be 
continued on Zinforo, if the HCP were confident about its use in that clinical setting. 
In addition, the MAH is concerned that HCPs do not share the same level of awareness that patients 
with concurrent bacteraemia are included under the approved indications of cSSTI and CAP. Provided 
within our previous response dated 20 May 2020, the MAH advised that queries were received from 
medical information, sales representatives, and customer facing medical colleagues. The Medical 
Information database for only European Union (EU) countries recorded 23 enquiries in 2019, which 
represents 5.72% of total for all Zinforo enquiries received in that year. Due to current marketing 
codes of conduct, as secondary bacteraemia is not explicitly mentioned in the SmPC, many Pfizer 
country offices are not able to discuss the topic of secondary bacteraemia with HCPs via sales 
representatives, nor can they inform HCPs on secondary bacteraemia by any proactive communication 
channels.  
Furthermore, older anti-infectives, including the comparator drugs used in the Zinforo Phase 3 clinical 
trials: ceftriaxone, vancomycin and aztreonam, have bacteraemia wording included in their respective 
PI, either as a statement referring to secondary bacteraemia (“(…) the treatment of patients with 
bacteraemia that occurs in association with, or is suspected to be associated with, any of the infections 
listed above”)7,8 or as a more inclusive indication of “Bacteraemia/septicaemia” as is the case for 
aztreonam.9 
The MAH believes that the omission of wording in the Zinforo PI may lead HCPs to not use, or delay 
use of, Zinforo in patients with concurrent bacteraemia who could potentially benefit from treatment 
with Zinforo.  
The MAH also notes the recent CHMP opinion received for secondary bacteraemia indication to the 
Zavicefta PI. The MAH understands that inclusion of concurrent bacteraemia text in Section 4.1 of the 
SmPC for Zavicefta was possible because such text was already included in the ceftazidime PI; 
however, HCPs likely do not share the same level of awareness or understanding of the regulatory 
guidance regarding the inclusion of bacteraemia text in Section 4.1. The discrepancy in bacteraemia 
text between the Zavicefta and Zinforo labels could inappropriately lead HCPs to believe that there is 
not adequate data to support the use of Zinforo in the case of secondary bacteraemia.  
Additional confusion may result from the lack of alignment between the Teflaro United States 
Prescribing Information (USPI), containing selective concurrent bacteraemia indication: “Teflaro is 
indicated in adult and paediatric patients 2 months of age and older for the treatment of community-
acquired bacterial pneumonia (CABP) caused by susceptible isolates of the following Gram-positive and 
Gram-negative microorganisms: Streptococcus pneumoniae (including cases with concurrent 
bacteraemia)”.10 
In summary, the MAH strongly believes that the absence of bacteraemia text in the current SmPC 
represents a significant issue. The strategy to include text into Section 5.1 would seem consistent with 
the draft “Guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products indicated for treatment of bacterial 
infections, Rev. 3”2: “Secondary analyses should not usually be included unless the information is of 
high importance to guide usage”. The MAH therefore proposes the following text to Section 5.1 of the 
SmPC, taking into account the comments received by the EMA within the updated AR dated 16 July 
2020: 
Assessment report  
EMA/659440/2020 
 
  
 
 
 
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties 
“Clinical efficacy in case of concurrent bacteraemia 
A limited number of patients with concurrent bacteraemia were enrolled in clinical trials conducted for 
the indications of cSSTI and CAP. Among 6 adult studies, 85/1446 (5.9%) patients with cSSTI and 
53/530 (10.0%) patients with CAP were bacteraemic at baseline, of which 72 patients were treated 
with ceftaroline fosamil. The clinical cure rates in patients with concurrent bacteraemia were 76.4% in 
the ceftaroline fosamil group and 77.3% in the comparator group (aztreonam/vancomycin for cSSTI 
and ceftriaxone for CAP). The clinical cure rates in non-bacteraemic patients were 85.1% and 82.2% in 
ceftaroline and comparator group (aztreonam/vancomycin for cSSTI and ceftriaxone for CAP), 
respectively.” 
Rapporteur Assessment 
No new data have been submitted. 
The MAH has submitted further arguments to support their request to include some text indicating the 
acceptance of the CHMP of the use of Zinforo in patients with concurrent bacteraemia. 
As previously, the discrepancy between the product information of antibacterial agents authorised at 
different time-points is accepted. 
Although the practical concern is well understood, the inclusion of the proposed data would create yet 
another configuration of product information that is not in line with the current regulatory practice. 
The basis for acceptance of the use of the product in patients with concurrent bacteraemia is wider 
than the proposed text/reference and issues around the data proposed to be included have been 
discussed in the earlier rounds of assessment. 
Based on the earlier CHMP position for similar cases and as there is no new data, the Rapporteur is of 
the opinion that the proposed text cannot be accepted for inclusion in section 5.1. of the SmPC. The 
public assessment report can be used as a reference to answer any queries to the MAH related to the 
topic. 
Issue not resolved. 
Supporting Rapporteur assessment: MS#1, MS#3, MS#4, MS#5 
MS#4 comment: MS#4 supports the Rapporteur´s position in that the proposed paragraph for Section 
5.1 should be deleted, the rationale for which has been provided in previous MS#4 comments. 
However, MS#4 proposes to exclude, in the assessment report, any hints to the Applicant that this 
possibly could have been resolved by additional data. 
Not supporting Rapporteur assessment: 
MS#2: We still agree with the Applicant that the inclusion of clinical trial data concerning bacteraemia 
linked to CAP and cSSTI provides relevant and important information for the prescriber. 
The inclusion of this information in section 5.1 does not contradict the requirements of the draft 
Guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products indicated for treatment of bacterial infections, Rev. 
3, but rather is in accordance with the Guideline. 
The wording as modified by the applicant is agreed with.

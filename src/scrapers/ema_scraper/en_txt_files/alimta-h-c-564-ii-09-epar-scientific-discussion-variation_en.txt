Introduction 
The active substance of Alimta is pemetrexed, an antifolate that exerts its antineoplastic activity by 
disrupting the folate-dependent metabolic processes essential for cell replication.  
In vitro studies have shown that pemetrexed behaves as a multitargeted antifolate by inhibiting 
thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide 
formyltransferase (GARFT), which are crucial for the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine 
nucleotides. Polyglutamated metabolites of pemetrexed and their prolonged intracellular half-life are 
resulting in prolonged drug action in malignant cells. 
Alimta was granted a Marketing Authorisation (MA) in the European Union (EU) on 20 September 
2004. Alimta is indicated in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of chemotherapy naïve 
patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. Alimta is also indicated as monotherapy 
for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer after prior 
chemotherapy. 
This type II variation concerns an extension of indication to include 1st line treatment in combination 
with cisplatin of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  
Lung cancer 
Over one million new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed each year worldwide, resulting in close to 
one million deaths. It is the second most common cancer in men as well as women, accounting for 
about 13% of cancer diagnoses, but it is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in industrialized 
countries. NSCLC represents about 80% of all lung cancer cases. The most common histologies are 
epidermoid or squamous cell carcinoma (30-35%), adenocarcinoma (40-45%), and large cell 
carcinoma (<10%). The frequency of these different histological subsets varies across countries and 
over time, with a decrease in squamous cell histology in industrialised countries. These histologies are 
often classified together because approaches to diagnosis, staging, prognosis, and treatment were 
similar in the past.  
Surgery is the preferred treatment of patients with early disease. However, in clinical practice, a high 
proportion of patients with NSCLC are diagnosed at an advanced stage of the disease (approximately 
30% with locally advanced and 40% with metastatic disease) with the remainder 25-30% presenting 
with early stage disease. Despite recent advances in treatment, the prognosis for patients with lung 
cancer remains poor. The 5-year survival rate for patients with NSCLC is still only about 15%.  
Research over the past decades has proven that chemotherapy has a definite role in the treatment of 
advanced NSCLC with incremental advances mainly occurring during the last two decades.  
One-year survival rates in patients with advanced NSCLC have increased from around 10% without 
chemotherapy, to 20% with an active single agent, and to 35% with the combination of two active 
drugs.  
Platinum-based chemotherapy has emerged as the standard treatment for advanced NSCLC. In 1995, a 
large meta-analysis evaluated first- and second-generation platinum-based regimens (developed in the 
1980s) and demonstrated a significant increase in median survival of 1.5 months and a 1-year survival 
rate of 10%, the latter corresponding to a 27% reduction in the probability of death for cisplatin-based 
therapy, compared with best supportive care. 
Thus,  the  current  standard  of  first-line  treatment  in  patients  with  advanced  disease  consists  of 
platinum-based  doublet  regimens  (combination  of  gemcitabine,  vinorelbine,  doectaxel  or  paclitaxel 
with  cisplatin  or  carboplatin)  where  1-year  survival  rates  of  33%  and  2-year  survival  rates  of  11% 
have been reported (Schiller et al.). The use of doublets as compared to cisplatin monotherapy seems 
to increase the overall survival and the TTP by approximately 2 months (Wozniak et al; Sandler et al.).

Scope of the variation 
This type II variation concerns an Extension of Indication to include 1st line treatment in combination 
with cisplatin of patients with locally advanced or metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer other than 
predominantly squamous cell histology. In addition, the existing 2nd line monotherapy indication has 
been amended accordingly. Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC have been updated and the 
Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.  
Further, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) has updated annex IIB to include a reference to 
the Pharmacovigilance system (version 2.0) and the Risk Management Plan (version 1.2) agreed with 
the CHMP.  
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make a minor change to section 4.5 of the SPC regarding 
concomitant use with yellow fever vaccine and to make minor editorial  changes to the SPC and 
Package Leaflet.  
For this new indication, the proposed posology is similar to the one authorised for pemetrexed in 
combination with cisplatin in the treatment of chemotherapy naïve patients with unresectable 
malignant pleural mesothelioma: pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 of body surface area (BSA) administered as 
an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes on the first day of each 21-day cycle; cisplatin is 75 mg/m2 
BSA infused over two hours approximately 30 minutes after completion of the pemetrexed infusion on 
the first day of each 21-day cycle. 
The new first line NSCLC indication is supported by one pivotal, controlled, Phase 3 study, H3E-MC-
JMDB (JMDB), which evaluated the efficacy of pemetrexed plus cisplatin (AC) versus gemcitabine 
plus cisplatin (GC) as the initial treatment of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC in 1725 patients. 
Non-clinical aspects 
The  non-clinical  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics,  and  toxicology  of  pemetrexed  disodium  were 
evaluated  in  a  battery  of  non-clinical  studies  that  were  discussed  as  part  of  the  initial  Marketing 
Authorisation application (MAA) for malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and previously treated 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  With reference to this new application (II/09), previous findings 
were summarised by the applicant, followed by a discussion focused on new data.  Only the new non-
clinical information included in this submission was assessed in this report, including: 
Safety Pharmacology: 
- 031216-FMD:  Effects of LY231514 Disodium (Compound 289739) on Cloned hERG Channels 
Expressed in Mammalian Cells. 
Repeat-dose Toxicology: 
- WIL-353055:  A Repeat-Dose Study in CD-1 Mice Given LY231514 Disodium (Compound 289739) 
Weekly by Intraperitoneal Injection for 6 Months 
- 500415:  A Repeat Dose Toxicity Study in the Beagle Dog Given LY231514 Disodium (Compound 
289739) by Intravenous Slow Bolus Injection Every 3 Weeks for 9 Months (14 Doses) 
GLP compliance 
These safety pharmacology, toxicology, and toxicokinetic studies were performed in accordance with 
Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations and were consistent with the Organisation for Economic 
Cooperation and Development (OECD) standards in effect at the time. 
Safety pharmacology 
The  objective  of  study  031216  was  to  examine  the  in  vitro  effects  of  LY231514  disodium 
(permetrexed) on IKr current, recapitulated by transfecting the hERG gene in HEK 293 cells. Each of 
Page 3 of 36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
three concentrations of LY231514 (30, 100 and 300 µM) was applied for 8 min to 3 cells. The results 
were compared to that of a control solution as well as the positive control E4031 (500 nM). To elicit 
IKr “tail” currents Chantest used a prepulse to +20 mV followed by a ramp (-0.5 V/sec) to -80 mV, 
which, in their hands, yields a greater sensitivity than a “step” protocol.   
In these conditions, permetrexed neither did significantly block hERG currents nor differ from control 
[-0.5 to +0.7% blockade as compared to +0.3% for control]. No IC20 or IC50 could be deducted from 
these  experiments  due  to  the  lack  of  effect,  confirmed  by  the  fact  that  a  500  nM  concentration  of 
E4031 significantly blocked hERG currents by 89%. 
Based on these data, unbound concentrations of up to at least 300 µM permetrexed (~128 µg/ml) or 
total plasma concentration of ~ 651 µg/ml are not expected to block IKr or induce a QT prolongation 
subsequent to that mechanism. 
Toxicology 
Since  the  initial  indication  for  malignant  mesothelioma  and  previously-treated  NSCLC,  a  6-month 
repeat  dose  study  in  mice  and  a  9-month  repeat  dose  study  in  dogs  were  conducted  to  support 
registration in Japan.  
Generally, the toxicity observed in these repeat-dose studies were similar to that observed in shorter 
duration  studies.    In  mice,  the  primary  effects  were  on  the  testis  and  included  decreased  testicular 
weight, degeneration of testicular seminiferous tubules, hyperplasia of interstitial (Leydig) cells, and 
reduced epididymal spermatozoa.  In dogs the effects typical of a cytotoxic agent were observed and 
included emesis, reduced food consumption resulting in minor fluctuations in body weight, decreases 
in  erythrocytes  and/or  leukocyte  counts  and  in  platelet  counts,  and  hematopoietic  hypocellularity  in 
bone marrow. These effects were similar to those observed in the 6-month repeat-dose study in dogs; 
however, the hematotoxicity was not as severe due to the change in dosing regimen from once a week 
in the 6-month study to once every 3 weeks in the 9-month study.  Additional changes observed in the 
9-month  study  included  decreased  testes  weight  with  degeneration/necrosis  of  the  seminiferous 
epithelium and minimal-to-slight renal tubular karyomegaly and degeneration with no organ weight or 
clinical pathology correlates.  The effects on the testes, although not seen in previous studies (possibly 
due to the age of the dogs), were entirely expected based on the effects in the mouse and the cytotoxic 
nature of pemetrexed (this finding from Study 500415 has previously been included in the SPC.  The 
effects on the kidney were observed in male dogs only and the overall mild nature of this change was 
further substantiated by the lack of concurrent compound-related changes in kidney weights, and the 
absence  of  any  changes  in  clinical  pathology  parameters  indicative  of  primary  renal  injury  or 
dysfunction,  even  after  9  months  of  treatment.    The  effects  of  pemetrexed  on  renal  function  were 
closely  monitored  in  the  pivotal  Phase  III  clinical  trials  and  no  adverse  findings  were  observed  on 
renal function. 
Discussion on Non-clinical aspects 
An  extensive  series  of  pharmacodynamic,  pharmacokinetic,  and  toxicology  studies  in  animals  have 
been conducted with pemetrexed disodium and were provided in the initial Marketing Authorisation 
application.    Protocols  for  the  recently  completed  safety  pharmacology  and  toxicology  studies  meet 
current international regulatory guidelines.  The format and presentation of the data were appropriate 
and the studies were performed in line with GLP regulations. 
The effects noted in these studies were consistent with the information provided in section 5.3 of the 
SPC and do not change the safety profile of pemetrexed.  The SPC adequately reflects knowledge of 
the  pharmacological  and  toxicological  properties  of  pemetrexed  disodium  and  includes  appropriate 
advice on reproductive risks and breast feeding and information on genotoxic potential.   
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment  
The MAH has also provided an environmental risk assessment (ERA) as part of the current application 
for the use of pemetrexed as first line treatment of non-small cell lung carcinoma. However, this ERA 
does not completely fulfil the Phase II requirements of the current Guideline on the Environmental 
Page 4 of 36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP/SWP/4447/00).  As a consequence, 
the MAH has agreed to conduct the requested Phase II studies as a post-opinion commitment. 
Clinical aspects 
GCP compliance 
All clinical studies included in the dossier have been conducted in compliance with the principles of 
Good Clinical Practice (GCP). 
Clinical pharmacology  
Two Phase I dose-escalation studies with pemetrexed were provided as part of this application; Study 
H3E-MC-JMAS (JMAS) and Study H3E-JE-1001 (1001).   
Further, PK interaction of pemetrexed and cisplatin was investigated in Study H3E-JE-ME01 (ME01) 
in Japanese patients. 
In  addition,  this  application  included  new  PD  (sub-)  studies  in  second  line  treatment  of  NSCLC 
(Studies  JMGX  and  NS01)  and  a  Biomarker  sub-study  of  the  pivotal  study  JMDB  (Study  JMDB-
PGX).  
- Study H3E-MC-JMAS   
Study JMAS was a Phase 1 dose-finding study of pemetrexed administered with high-dose folic acid 
(FA)  or  standard-dose  FA  supplementation  through  multivitamins  (MV)  in  patients  with  locally 
advanced or metastatic cancer.  
The  primary  objective  of  this  study  was  to  determine  the  maximum-tolerated  dose  (MTD)  of 
pemetrexed  when  administered  as  a  10-minute  infusion  every  3  weeks  given  with  oral  folic  acid 
supplementation for 2 days prior, the day of, and for 2 days after study drug administration in patients 
with locally advanced or metastatic cancer. 
The secondary objectives of this study were: 
-To  determine  the  quantitative  and  the  qualitative  toxicities  of  pemetrexed  with  folic  acid  alone  or 
multivitamin supplementation,  
-to  determine  the  recommended  dose  for  pemetrexed  with  folic  acid  and  with  multivitamin 
supplementation for future studies,   
-to  assess  the  plasma  pharmacokinetics  of  pemetrexed  with  folic  acid  and  with  multivitamin 
supplementation,  
- to document antitumor activity of pemetrexed with folic acid and with multivitamin supplementation, 
and  
-to determine the folate status of patients. 
Patients were classified according to pretreatment status.  Lightly pretreated patients (LPT) were those 
who  received  no  prior  treatment,  up  to  2  courses  of  mitomycin-C,  up  to  6  courses  of  an  alkylating 
agent, or up to 4 courses of carboplatin.  Heavily pretreated patients (HPT) were those who previously 
received more than one of these treatments for their cancer, or any radiotherapy to the pelvic region.   
Thus, 4 cohorts of patients (FA_HPT, FA_LPT, MV_HPT, and MV_LPT) were enrolled in the study 
consisting of 127 patients (72 male and 55 female), of which 99 patients (59 male and 40 female) were 
included in the pharmacokinetic analyses.   
Pemetrexed  doses  ranging  from  600  mg/m2  to  1400  mg/m2  were  administered  as  a  10-minute 
intravenous infusion on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle.

MTD Results 
Pharmacokinetics results 
Plasma concentration versus time data were evaluated using population pharmacokinetic analysis.  
The pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed administered as a 10-minute intravenous infusion with vitamin 
supplementation  were  characterized  by  a  three-compartment  model.  Population  estimates  of 
pemetrexed  systemic  clearance  (CL)  and  volume  of  distribution  at  steady  state  (Vss)  were  88.0 
mL/min and 17.0 L, respectively. Pemetrexed (CL) was independent of dose over the dose ranges of 
571-1413 mg/m2 and 888 to 2744 mg m2; therefore AUC is dose proportional over these dose ranges. 
Results  from  this  study  demonstrate  that  pemetrexed  pharmacokinetics  are  linear  (that  CL  is,  dose-
independent over the range of doses studied).  This indicates that pemetrexed total systemic exposure 
(AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) increase proportionally with dose. The data are in 
accordance with the known PK profile of pemetrexed. 
- Study H3E-JE-1001 
This was a Phase 1 dose-escalation study of pemetrexed in Japanese patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic cancer.  Patients were classified according to pre-treatment status.  Pemetrexed doses 
ranged from 300 mg/m2 to 1200 mg/m2 and were administered as a 10-minute intravenous infusion 
on Day 1 of a 21-day cycle.  Pharmacokinetic data were available from 31 patients (20 male and 11 
female). 
The primary pharmacokinetic objective of this trial was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of 
LY231514 disodium administered with folic acid and vitamin B12 in Japanese patients. 
The secondary objectives of this study were: 
▪ To determine the maximum-tolerated dose and recommended dose of LY231514 when administered 
as a 10-minute infusion every 21 days given with folic acid and vitamin B12 to Japanese patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic cancer. 
▪ To determine the quantitative and qualitative toxicities of LY231514 administered with folic acid 
and vitamin B12. 
▪ To assess the pharmacokinetics of LY231514 when administered with folic acid and vitamin B12. 
▪ To investigate antitumor activity of LY231514 administered with folic acid and vitamin B12.

Pharmacokinetics Results 
Total plasma clearance of pemetrexed was independent of dose with a mean clearance of 81.9 mL/min 
(clearance ranged from 61.4 to 109 mL/min across all doses in this study).  Steady-state volume of 
distribution was also consistent across doses and ranged from 10.6 to 14.8 L.  Half-life ranged from 
2.28 to 3.62 hours and was dose independent.  Both AUC(0-∞) and Cmax were dose proportional over 
the dose range of 500 mg/m2 to 1000 mg/m2. 
The data are in accordance with the known PK profile of pemetrexed. 
- Study H3E-JE-ME01 
Study ME01 was a Phase 1/2 study of  pemetrexed administered in combination with cisplatin in 
Japanese patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma.  Pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 was administered as 
an intravenous infusion over 10 minutes followed by a 2-hour cisplatin infusion (60 mg/m2 or 75 
mg/m2) beginning 30 minutes after the completion of pemetrexed infusion.  Doses were administered 
on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle.  Pemetrexed plasma concentration-time data were available from 25 
patients.  
Concomittant Therapy, Dose, and Mode of Administration 
-Patients were required to take an oral multivitamin 1 g (containing folic acid 500 µg) once daily from 
at least 7 days before Day 1 of the scheduled administration of the study drugs in Cycle 1. After 
discontinuing administration of the study drugs, multivitamin was continuously administered until 22 
days after the last dose of the study drugs if possible. 
- A vitamin B12 injection at a dose of 1000 µg had to be intramuscularly administered at least 7 days 
before Day 1 of Cycle 1, and had to be given approximately every 9 weeks (± 7 days) from the date 
when vitamin B12 was firstly administered until 22 days after the last dose of the study drugs if 
possible. 
The primary pharmacokinetic objective was to characterize the pharmacokinetics of LY231514 and 
cisplatin when coadministered in Japanese patients and to compare the pharmacokinetics to that 
characterized in Western patients (Study H3E-MC-JMCH [JMCH]). 
Plasma sampling for pharmacokinetic assessment was conducted in Cycles 1 and 3 for 
characterization of both Alimta and total platinum pharmacokinetics. 
Results 
Study JMCH was a randomized study of pemetrexed plus cisplatin versus single-agent cisplatin for the 
treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma and was provided as a pivotal study in the initial 
submission of pemetrexed.  Pemetrexed data from Study ME01 were combined with data from Study 
JMCH (N=68) for purposes of pharmacokinetic analysis.   
The following plot is comparing pemetrexed plasma clearance in several studies (JMAA, JMAS, 1001, 
JMCH, and ME01). JMAA was a  dose-escalation Phase 1 study included in the initial submission. 
 The range of plasma clearance of pemetrexed is similar whether administered as a single agent or in 
combination with cisplatin.  The median pemetrexed clearance was around 80.0 mL/min and the 
steady-state volume of distribution was 14.4 L in Study ME01.

Cisplatin data was available from 25 patients in Study ME01.  Cisplatin concentration-time data from 
Study ME01 was combined with data from Study JMCH (63 patients in the combination arm, and 74 
patients from the cisplatin single-agent arm) for purposes of cisplatin pharmacokinetic analysis. 
The  figure  below  shows  the  total  platinum  plasma  concentration-time  profile  in  Study  ME01  and 
Study JMCH.  In Study JMCH, cisplatin was administered alone or in combination with pemetrexed.  
The  dose-normalized  total  platinum  plasma  exposures  in  Studies  JMCH  and  ME01  are  comparable.  
This suggests that total platinum plasma exposures are comparable whether administered alone or in 
combination with pemetrexed.

The results show, as in the original MAA, that the pharmacokinetics of pemetrexed are not altered 
when administered with cisplatin. 
- Study JMDB-PGX (Biomarker Sub-Study of pivotal Study JMDB discussed below) 
The pivotal trial of this application, JMDB, provided a biomarker sub-study; participation in this 
substudy was optional. Of the overall 177 investigators of the main study, 20 main investigators 
participated in the sub-study. It was anticipated that from the main trial, about 40% of patients (344 
patients per treatment arm) should have specimens studied in this sub-study. A total of 366 patients 
Page 8 of 36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were consented for this substudy (in both arms) of whom 232 patients had specimens submitted, 113 
on AC and 119 on GC. 
The study investigated expression levels of several biomarkers known to be involved in pemetrexed, 
gemcitabine, and cisplatin mechanisms of action and resistance, including genes involved in the 
activation and transport, as well as genes believed to have prognostic value in NSCLC. Biomarkers of 
interest included thymidylate synthase (TS), folylpoly-γ-glutamate synthetase (FPGS), γ -glutamyl 
hydrolase (GGH), ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1), deoxycytidine kinase (dCK), human 
equilibrative nucleoside transporter (hENT1), multidrug resistance protein 5 (MRP5), excision repair 
crosscomplementing (ERCC1), and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). 
The association between expression levels of biomarkers and survival time was assessed within and 
between each treatment arm. All patients with clinical outcome data and protein or gene expression 
data falling within specified reference ranges were included in the analyses. 
Samples were obtained from 232 patients, 16 of which had insufficient tumour tissue for analysis.  
Patients with IHC data included 90 patients in Treatment Arm AC and 91 patients in Treatment Arm 
GC. 
Patients with gene expression data within reference range included 26 patients in AC and 43 patients 
in GC. 
Patients with both gene and protein data (patients with at least 1 result) included 13 patients in AC and 
21 patients in GC. 
In this exploratory study, the data analysis of samples received showed statistically significant patterns 
in a number of analyses that may be of scientific interest for further investigation. Because of the small 
sample size, results should be considered useful as exploratory analyses but not definitive statements. 
•  A consistent treatment-independent relationship between higher EGFR expression, both for 
gene as well as protein, and improved clinical outcome for all time-to-event outcomes and 
best tumour response was observed. 
•  All other markers either showed lower levels of statistical significance or association with 
fewer clinical outcomes. 
•  For patients treated with AC, there was an association between lower TS mRNA expression 
and better outcomes (increased time-to-progressive disease [TtPD] and time-to-treatment 
failure [TtTF]). Conversely for GC, higher TS mRNA levels were associated with increased 
TtPD and TtTF. 
•  The analysis uncovered links between high FPGS gene expression and improved TtPD, 
regardless of treatment. 
•  For patients treated with AC, lower expression of ERCC1 was associated with increased TtTF. 
Patients with high ERCC1 expression showed a trend toward improved progression-free 
survival (PFS) and TtPD. There was a significant interaction between treatment and baseline 
ERCC1. Expression level-dependent treatment effects for PFS and TtPD were identified. 
Due to the small sample size, results should be considered informative but not confirmatory. 
- Study JMGX 
This was a randomized, open-label, multi-centre, Phase 3 study on second-line patients with NSCLC 
comparing overall survival following treatment with pemetrexed 500 mg/m2 (=licensed second line 
monotherapy schedule) versus pemetrexed 900 mg/m2 in patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
(Stage III or IV) NSCLC who had failed a prior platinum-containing chemotherapy. 
Of the 629 patients who entered the study, 588 were randomly assigned to treatment and 41 patients 
were not. Of the 588 patients, 295 patients were randomly assigned to the 500 mg/m2 arm and 293 to 
the 900 mg/m2 arm. Seven patients were randomized but never treated. During this study, the data 
monitoring committee (DMC) recommended to discontinue further enrolment and to stop treatment 
with the higher dose (900 mg/m2) of pemetrexed due to lack of evidence to suggest that there would be 
Page 9 of 36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a statistically significant improvement in survival with the higher dose (900 mg/m2) of pemetrexed 
compared with the standard dose (500 mg/m2). Fifty-one patients who were still receiving treatment on 
the 900 mg/m2 treatment arm were switched to the 500 mg/m2 treatment arm (the 900-mg/m2 and 500-
mg/m2 group). 
The final efficacy analyses showed no statistically significant difference in overall survival time 
between the 2 treatment groups (HR 1.0132; 95% CI 0.837, 1.226; p=0.8930). The median survival 
time was 6.7 months for the 500 mg/m2 arm and 6.9 months for the 900 mg/m2 arm. 
Secondary efficacy outcomes included PFS and tumour response rates. The Cox proportional hazards 
model revealed no statistically significant difference in PFS between the 500 mg/m2 and 900 mg/m2 
treatment groups. Median PFS time was 2.6 months in the 500 mg/m2 group and 2.8 months in the 900 
mg/m2 group. The chi-square test showed no statistically significant difference in the tumour response 
rate between the 500 mg/m2 and 900 mg/m2 groups (7.1% versus 4.3%, p=0.1616). Stable disease 
rates were 50.6% and 53.1%, respectively. 
The percentage of serious adverse events (SAEs) was numerically higher (37.9% versus 32.1%) in the 
900 mg/m2 group compared with the 500 mg/m2 group. The percentage of SAEs among the 51 patients 
in the 900 to 500 mg/m2 group was 49%. The percentage of fatal SAEs was 4.5% for the 500 mg/m2 
arm, 5.0% for the 900-mg/m2 arm, and 5.9% for the 900 to 500-mg/m2 group. The percentage of drug-
related fatal SAEs was 0.7% for the 500-mg/m2, 1.3% for the 900-mg/m2, and 2.0% for the 900 to 500-
mg/m2 groups. The percentage of life-threatening adverse events was 2.1% for 500 mg/m2, 1.7% for 
the 900 mg/m2, and 2.0% for the 900 to 500-mg/m2 groups. 
In general, the frequency of adverse events was similar between the low and high dose of pemetrexed. 
However, for the following adverse events, more than a 5 percentage point difference in frequency 
between the 900 mg/m2 and 500 mg/m2 groups was observed: 
Anaemia (32.9% versus 22.1%), fatigue (41.7% versus 32.8%), vomiting (20.0% versus 13.1%), 
thrombocytopenia (11.3% versus 5.5%), and diarrhoea (15.4% versus 10.0%). 
This large monotherapy trial in second line NSCLC patients overall confirms the MA status of Alimta, 
and suggests that the dosage recommended within the first MA procedure is already near the optimum, 
both in terms of efficacy and safety. 
- Study NS01 
This was a multi-centre, randomized, open-label clinical trial involving Japanese patients with 
advanced NSCLC who previously received systemic chemotherapy (one or two regimens). The 
planned sample size was 240 patients (120 patients each in the 500 and 1000 mg/m2 arms). 
The actual number of patients assigned to treatment arms was 244. The number of patients actually 
treated with pemetrexed was 226 patients (114 patients in the 500 mg/m2 arm and 112 patients in the 
1000 mg/m2 arm). 
The primary efficacy endpoint in this study was response rate. Efficacy analyses were performed for 
the FAS (full analysis set; 216 patients) population based on “best overall response” assessments 
performed by an independent case judgment committee. 
Best overall responses assessed by the case judgment committee for 108 subjects in the 500 mg/m2 
group (who met the criteria for FAS) were as follows: complete response (CR), n=0; partial response 
(PR), n=20; stable disease (SD), n=40; progressive disease (PD), n=48; and not evaluable (NE), n=0. 
The response rate (CR+PR rate) was 18.5% (90% confidence interval (CI): 12.6% to 25.8%). The 
lower limit of one-sided 95% CI was 12.6%. 
Best overall responses assessed by the case judgment committee for 108 subjects in the 1000 mg/m2 
group (who met the criteria for FAS) were as follows: CR, n=0; PR, n=16; SD, n=34; PD, n=58; and 
NE, n=0. The response rate was 14.8% (90% CI: 9.5% to 21.6%).  
The median duration of response for 20 subjects with PR in the 500 mg/m2 group was 4.7 months 
(95% CI: 3.8 to 6.8 months). The median duration of response for 16 subjects with PR in the 1000 
mg/m2 group was 3.8 months (95% CI: 2.5 to 6.3 months).

The median PFS for 108 subjects in the 500 mg/m2 was 3.0 months (95% CI: 2.0 to 3.3 months). 
The median PFS for 108 subjects in the 1000 mg/m2
 was 2.4 months (95% CI: 1.8 to 3.1 months). 
Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) which occurred with an incidence of ≥50% in the 500 
mg/m2 group included: 
Aspartate  aminotransferase  increased,  n=88  (77.2%);  Alanine  aminotransferase  increased,  n=81 
(71.1%);  White  blood  cell  count  decreased,  n=80  (70.2%);  Rash,  n=79  (69.3%);  Neutrophil  count 
decreased,  n=73  (64.0%);  Blood  LDH  increased,  n=71  (62.3%);  Nausea,  n=64  (56.1%);  and 
Haemoglobin decreased, n=58 (50.9%). 
TEAE which occurred with an incidence of ≥50% in the 1000 mg/m2 group included: 
Rash, n=89 (80.2%); Aspartate aminotransferase increased, n=88 (79.3%); Alanine aminotransferase 
increased, n=82 (73.9%); White blood cell count decreased, n=81 (73.0%); Anorexia, n=78 (70.3%); 
Neutrophil  count  decreased,  n=72  (64.9%);  Blood  LDH  increased,  n=71  (64.0%);  Haemoglobin 
decreased, n=69 (62.2%); Nausea, n=65 (58.6%); and Lymphocyte count decreased, n=64 (57.7%). 
Grade 3 or higher TEAE which occurred with an incidence of ≥10% in the 500-mg/m2 group included: 
Neutrophil count decreased, n=23 (20.2%); Alanine aminotransferase increased, n=19 (16.7%); White 
blood cell count decreased, n=16 (14.0%); and Lymphocyte count decreased, n=16 (14.0%). 
Grade 3 or higher TEAE which occurred with an incidence of ≥10% in the 1000 mg/m2 group 
included: Neutrophil count decreased, n=27 (24.3%); Lymphocyte count decreased, n=24 (21.6%); 
White blood cell count decreased, n=23 (20.7%); and Anorexia, n=17 (15.3%). 
Results of trial NS01 both in terms of efficacy and safety confirm the findings and conclusions of trial 
JMGX and support the approved pemetrexed dose of 500 mg/m2
. 
Discussion on Clinical pharmacology 
The  results  from  Study  H3E-MC-JMAS  demonstrated  that  pemetrexed  pharmacokinetics  are  linear 
(i.e. that CL is dose-independent over the range of doses studied).  Pemetrexed total systemic exposure 
(AUC) and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) increase proportionally with dose. The data are in 
accordance with the known PK profile of pemetrexed. 
The results from Study H3E-JE-ME01 show, as in the original MAA, that the pharmacokinetics of 
pemetrexed are not altered when administered with cisplatin. 
The small number of patients included in the biomarker sub-study preclude any reliable conclusion 
although the exploratory results suggest that it would have been valuable to have more reliable data 
available on e.g. EGFR and TS expression and correlation with efficacy. There are insufficient data at 
this time to correlate tumour biomarkers with histology and therapeutic outcomes with pemetrexed. 
The  large  monotherapy  trial  JMGX  in  second  line  NSCLC  patients  confirms  that  the  dosage 
recommended at the time of the first MAA is already near the optimum, both in terms of efficacy and 
safety. The results of trial NS01 confirm the findings and conclusions of study JMGX and also support 
the approved pemetrexed dose of 500 mg/m2
.

- Study JMAY was a multicentre study enrolling 36 patients at 4 study centres:  1 in Austria and 3 in 
Germany.  Of the 36 qualified patients, 29 (80.6%) were male.  The median age of the patients was 58 
years, with a range of 26 to 73 years.  Eighteen patients (50%) had Stage IIIB and 18 patients (50%) 
had Stage IV disease.  All 36 patients had a World Health Organization (WHO) performance status of 
0 or 1. 
-Study JMBZ was a multicentre study, enrolling 31 patients at 5 study centres in Canada.  Of the 31 
qualified patients, 20 (65%) were male.  The median age of the patients was 60 years, with a range of 
35  to  75  years.    Five  patients  (16%)  had  Stage  IIIB  and  26  patients  (84%)  had  Stage  IV  disease.  
Twenty-seven patients (83%) had an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, and 5 patients (16%) had an 
ECOG performance status of 2. 
The  main  differences  between  study  populations  were  in  the  proportion  of  patients  with  Stage  IV 
disease  (50%  versus  84%,  respectively)  and  performance  status  (PS);  in  both  studies,  a  majority  of 
patients  had  PS  1  (75%  versus  77%,  respectively),  but  Study  JMAY  had  a  greater  number  of  PS  0 
patients (22% versus 6%, respectively), and Study JMAY had no PS 2 patients (0% versus 16%).

Pivotal clinical Phase III study – JMDB 
Methods 
The primary objective of this study was to compare pemetrexed plus cisplatin with gemcitabine plus 
cisplatin  in  terms  of  the  Overall  Survival  (OS)  of  previously  untreated  patients  with  Stage  IIIB  (not 
amenable to curative treatment) and Stage IV NSCLC. 
The main secondary objectives of the study were to compare the following between treatment arms: 
- time-to-event efficacy variables, including: 
o 
o 
o 
o 
progression-free survival (PFS) 
time-to-progressive disease (TtPD) 
             duration of response (DoR) 
time-to-treatment failure (TtTF) 
- objective tumour response 
- quantitative and qualitative laboratory and non-laboratory toxicities

Study Design 
This was a multicentre, randomized, open-label, phase III, non-inferiority study. Approximately 1700 
patients  were  to  be  enrolled  in  this  study.  Eligible  patients  were  randomized  evenly  between  the 
experimental  treatment  arm  (pemetrexed  plus  cisplatin  [AC])  and  the  control  treatment  arm 
(gemcitabine plus cisplatin [GC]). Patients in both treatment arms received folic acid and vitamin B12 
and dexamethasone pre-treatment supplementation.  
Investigational  sites  involved  in  Study  JMDB  were  invited  to  participate  in  an  optional  companion 
biomarker  research  protocol.  Following  an  initial  randomization  based  on  whether  the  investigative 
center  was  participating  in  the  companion  biomarker  study  (yes  versus  no),  randomization  was 
adjusted  for  baseline  factors  including  disease  stage  (IIIB  versus  IV),  ECOG  performance  status  (0 
versus  1),  history  of  brain  metastases  (yes  versus  no),  sex  (male  versus  female),  basis  for  initial 
pathological diagnosis (histological versus cytological), and investigative centre.  
Each patient underwent a treatment period and a follow-up period. The treatment period consisted of 
treatment cycles, each 21 days long. Patients received up to 6 cycles of assigned treatment (control or 
experimental). The follow-up period began when the treatment period was completed. Patients were to 
be followed up with periodic tumour response evaluation until disease progression. All patients were 
followed until death or study closure.

approval for any indication at the time of study entry; 
2.  peripheral neuropathy of ≥CTC Grade 1; 
3. 
4.  a serious concomitant systemic disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, would have

Page 14 of 36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5.  a serious cardiac condition, such as myocardial infarction within 6 months, angina, or heart 
disease, as defined by the New York Heart Association Class III or IV; 
6.  second primary malignancy that was clinically detectable at the time of consideration for study 
enrolment. 
Treatment regimen 
Control arm:  The  cisplatin  dose  75  mg/  m2  in  combination  with  gemcitabine  1250 mg/  m2  has  been 
tested  in  a  large  randomized  Phase  3  study  (Scagliotti  et al.  2003)  that  produced  consistent  efficacy 
and  safety  data  as  compared  with  other  gemcitabine/cisplatin  studies.  The  21-day  regimen  of 
gemcitabine  in  combination  with  cisplatin  was  utilized  as  a  control,  as  this  is  a  clinical  standard 
regimen  in  patients  with  NSCLC.  In  addition,  a  randomized  Phase  2  trial  suggested  that  there  was 
similar efficacy and dose intensity in the 21- versus the 28-day regimen (Soto Parra et al. 2002).  
Treatments Administered:  Patients were randomized to receive up to 6 cycles of pemetrexed plus 
cisplatin (AC) or gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) combination therapy, as follows: 
Experimental Arm A: 
Control Arm B: 
pemetrexed  500  mg/m2  plus  cisplatin  75  mg/m2  on  Day  1 
every 21 days. 
gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 on Day 1 and Day 8 plus cisplatin 
75 mg/m2 on Day 1 every 21 days. 
Selection of Doses in the Study: Data from a Phase 1 Study, H3E-MC-JMAP (JMAP) of pemetrexed 
and cisplatin contributed to the selection of the pemetrexed and cisplatin doses for patients assigned to 
Treatment Arm A in this study. The maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) for the first cohort was reached 
at 600 mg/ m2 pemetrexed and 100 mg/ m2 cisplatin, with dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) of 
thrombocytopenia and febrile neutropenia. The data from this study would have led to a dose of 
600 mg/ m2 and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 to become the recommended Phase 2 dose. However, because of 
toxicities observed in other single-agent Phase 2 studies, the recommended Phase 2/3 dose for this 
combination became 500 mg/ m2 pemetrexed and 75 mg/ m2 cisplatin, as used in the pivotal phase 3 
study in mesothelioma. The dose of cisplatin in combination with gemcitabine has varied from 75 mg/ 
m2 to 100 mg/ m2 every 21 days. Based on the non-inferiority study design of this study, the cisplatin 
dose was selected to match the Treatment Arm A cisplatin dose (75 mg/ m2).  
Prior and Concomitant Therapy: Patients in both treatment groups were fully supplemented with folic 
acid and vitamin B12, as well as dexamethasone prophylaxis. Patients were allowed to receive full 
supportive-care therapies concomitantly during the study. Antiemetics could be used. Palliative 
radiation therapy was permitted for irradiating small areas of painful metastases that could not be 
managed adequately using systemic or local analgesics. Any disease progression requiring other forms 
of specific antitumor therapy was cause for early discontinuation of study therapy. No other anticancer 
therapy were permitted while the patients were participating in this study.  
Efficacy and safety variables 
The following definitions for time-to-event measures will apply: 
-  Overall  survival  (OS)  is  measured  from  the  date  of  randomization  to  the  date  of  death  from  any 
cause. 
-  Progression-free  survival  (PFS)  is  measured  from  the  date  of  randomization  to  the  first  date  of 
progression of disease (clinical or objective) or death from any cause.  
-  Time  to  progressive  disease  is  measured  from  the  date  of  randomization  to  the  first  date  of 
progression of disease (clinical or objective).  
- Duration of tumor response is measured from the date of the first objective status assessment of a 
complete or partial response to the first date of progression of disease (clinical or objective) or death 
from any cause.  
-  Time  to  treatment  failure  is  measured  from  the  date  of  randomization  until  the  date  of 
discontinuation from study due to AE, progression of disease (clinical or objective), or death from any 
cause.

Statistical methods 
The statistical hypotheses were: 
•  H0:  HR  ≥1.17647 (null hypothesis) 
•  Ha:  HR  <1.17647 (alternative, research hypothesis) 
The non-inferiority margin of 1.17647 corresponds to GC having a 15% lower survival hazard (that is, 
risk of death) than that of AC.  If this hazard ratio is observed and is assumed to be constant, this non-
inferiority margin would translate into a 17.6% longer median survival for the GC arm.  Therefore, a 
statistically significant result implies that the median survival for AC is at least 85% as long as that for 
GC.  As prespecified in the Statistical Analysis Plan, if the 95% confidence interval for HR was found 
to fall entirely below the margin of 1.17647, the null hypothesis H0 would be rejected at a one-sided 
0.025 significance level and thus support the conclusion that AC is non-inferior to GC. 
The  study  required  at  least  1190  deaths  in  accordance  with  the  study  design  and  sample  size 
assumptions.  
Two  interim  analyses  for  futility  were  planned  and  conducted  per  protocol,  in  May  and  September 
2005,  respectively.  The  first  interim  analysis  was  planned  to  occur  after  approximately  700  patients 
had been enrolled (after a minimum of 200 patients had progressive disease or had died). Dependent 
on  results  of  the  first  interim  analysis,  a  second  interim  analysis  was  to  occur  approximately  2 to  3 
months after the first interim analysis. 
Efficacy analysis 
The  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  a  non-inferiority  analysis  of  OS  for  patients  treated  with  AC 
compared to patients treated with GC.   
The  overall  survival  hazard  ratio  (HR)  of  pemetrexed  plus  cisplatin  over  gemcitabine  plus  cisplatin 
was assumed to be approximately constant from randomization until death. For the primary analysis of 
this study, HR was estimated from survival data on all randomized patients using a Cox proportional 
hazards  model.  This  Cox  model  was  used  for  all  time-to-event  endpoints.  In  addition,  unadjusted 
analyses were performed for each time-to-event endpoint, based on Kaplan Meier methods.  
Non-inferiority p-values were also calculated for both Cox adjusted and unadjusted analyses at a one-
sided, 0.025 significance level. Tumour response rate was also summarized and tested for superiority 
(two-sided, 0.05 significance level) using normal approximation for the difference in rates.  
Time-to-event  hazard  ratios  (HR)  were  estimated  using  Cox  proportional  hazards  models  using  the 
following  baseline  covariates:  assigned  study  treatment  arm  (pemetrexed  plus  cisplatin  [AC]  over 
gemcitabine plus cisplatin [GC]), disease stage (IIIB over IV), ECOG performance status (0 over 1), 
sex  (female  over  male),  basis  for  initial  pathological  diagnosis  (histopathological  over  cytological). 
The  covariates  listed  above  were  chosen  to  correspond  with  the  factors  involved  in  randomization, 
with the exceptions of investigator site, history of brain metastases, and participation in the biomarker 
research protocol. 
Patient Populations for Efficacy Analyses 
Four different analysis populations were utilized for the analysis of study JMDB:  
- The primary efficacy analyses, as well as baseline characteristics, were based on the intent-to-treat 
(ITT) population, consisting of all patients who were randomized (regardless of whether they were 
treated  or  not),  and  analyzed  according  to  the  therapy  as  randomized  (regardless  of  what  they 
received).  
-  The  tumour  response  rate  and  duration  of  response  were  analyzed  on  the  tumour-qualified 
population, rather than the ITT population. The tumor-qualified population consisted of patients who 
had a diagnosis of Stage IIIB or IV NSCLC, did not receive other systemic chemotherapy, had at least 
1  measurable  lesion  at  baseline  (per  the  RECIST  criteria)  and  postbaseline,  and  received  at  least  1 
dose of pemetrexed, gemcitabine, or cisplatin, and analyzed according to the therapy received in the 
first cycle.

-  Sensitivity  analyses  of  key  efficacy  endpoints  were  also  assessed  on  the  protocol-qualified 
population,  which  consisted  of  patients  who  had  a  diagnosis  of  Stage  IIIB  or  IV  NSCLC,  did  not 
receive  other  systemic  chemotherapy,  had  at  least  1  measurable  lesion  at  baseline  (per  the  RECIST 
criteria), and received at least 1 dose of pemetrexed, gemcitabine, or cisplatin, and analyzed according 
to the therapy received in the first cycle.  
-  Lastly,  the  safety  analyses  were  performed  on  the  randomized  and  treated  patients  (received  at 
least  one  dose  of  pemetrexed,  gemcitabine,  or  cisplatin),  and  analyzed  according  to  the  therapy 
received in the first cycle.  
Subgroup and Sensitivity Analyses 
Subgroup Analyses 
The following subgroup analyses of OS were prespecified: 
1.  randomization factors (disease stage, performance status, sex, basis for initial pathological 
diagnosis); 
2.  age and origin as regulatory requirements; 
3.  ever-smoker versus never-smoker; 
4.  histology categories of adenocarcinoma, squamous cell, large cell, and other – based on 
retrospective analyses of other Lilly pemetrexed data in NSCLC. 
The analyses were performed using both Cox adjusted and Kaplan Meier analysis. 
Main sensitivity Analyses 
These sensitivity analyses included: 
1.  use of protocol-qualified population on key efficacy endpoints to assess robustness of results;  
2.  use of central blinded review of lesion assessments for determination of progression on a 
randomly selected subset of approximately 400 patients (from approximately the first 1000 
patients enrolled) for PFS; 
3.  potential impact of post-discontinuation anticancer therapy on PFS. 
Efficacy results 
Overall, 1833 patients entered trial JMDB at 177 sites in 26 countries. Of these patients, 1725 (94.1%) 
were  randomly  assigned  to  either  pemetrexed  plus  cisplatin  (AC  arm)  or  gemcitabine  plus  cisplatin 
(GC arm). Of the 1833 patients entered, a total of 108 patients were not randomized; therefore, a total 
of 1725 patients were enrolled into the study. Of the enrolled patients, 862 patients were randomized 
to the AC arm, and 863 patients were randomized to the GC arm. A total of 1669 (91.1%) received 
study treatment consisting of at least 1 dose of pemetrexed, cisplatin, or gemcitabine (AC, n=839; GC, 
n=830).

Concomitant  treatment:  For  both  treatment  arms,  systemic  steroids  were  the  most  commonly 
reported  concomitant  medication  (note  that  corticosteroids  were  required  as  prophylaxis  for  both 
treatment  arms  according  to  study  protocol).  Patients  on  the  GC  arm  received  significantly  more 
erythropoietin/darbepoetin than patients on the AC arm (18.1% versus 10.4%; p<0.001) and more iron 
preparations than patients on the AC arm (7.0% versus 4.3%; p=0.021). Patients on the GC arm also 
received  significantly  more  G-CSF/GM-CSF  than  patients  on  the  AC  arm  (6.1%  versus  3.1%; 
p=0.004).  
Primary efficacy endpoints 
A  total  of  862  patients  on  the  AC  arm  and  863  patients  on  the  GC  arm  were  included  in  the  OS 
analysis of randomized patients.

Progression-Free Survival – Sensitivity Analyses 
Sensitivity  analyses  were  conducted  on  PFS  to  investigate  whether  various  event  and  censoring 
mechanisms for progressive disease had any impact on the interpretation of the PFS results. The main 
sensitivity analysis (SA1) addressed the potential impact of postdiscontinuation anticancer therapy. In 
the  primary  PFS  analysis,  postdiscontinuation  anticancer  therapy  use  was  not  considered  even  if  it 
occurred prior to documentation of progression or death. To verify that postdiscontinuation anticancer

therapy did not affect the interpretation of the PFS results, this sensitivity analysis censored patients 
that received postdiscontinuation anticancer therapy prior to documented disease progression (clinical 
or objective) or death.

postdiscontinuation systemic treatment. 
b  p-value is from Fisher’s Exact test.  
The post discontinuation systemic anticancer agents received were balanced between treatment arms, 
with  the  exception  of  post-pemetrexed  or  post-gemcitabine  exposure.  A  very  small  percentage  of 
patients were reported to receive the same drug (pemetrexed or gemcitabine) post discontinuation as 
was received according to randomized study treatment, and some patients crossed over to receive the 
opposite drug in post discontinuation treatment. Overall, fewer patients on the AC arm received post 
discontinuation  systemic  anticancer  treatment  (chemotherapy,  targeted  therapy,  or  immunotherapy) 
than patients on the GC arm (52.6% versus 56.1%), and significantly fewer patients on the AC arm 
received chemotherapy agents post discontinuation (41.5% versus 47.3%, p=0.018). 
Less than 50% of patients in each group completed the 6 cycles of treatment (45.2% for the AC arm 
and  46.4%  for  the  GC  arm).  85.8%  of  planned  mean  dose  of  gemcitabine  has  been  administered 
compared  to  94.8%  of  pemetrexed,  but  this  is  acceptable  since  the  figures  are  in  line  with  clinical 
practice  and  previous  studies.  Active  post-discontinuation  treatments  were  given.  The  proportion  of 
patients who switched after discontinuation of the initial treatment is not negligible in the context of a 
non-inferiority  trial  (16.7%  of  the  AC  group  received  gemcitabine  and  13.4%  of  the  GC  group 
received  premetrexed).  However,  the  MAH  has  provided  additional  OS  analyses  excluding  patients 
who switched and these analyses are reassuring and support non-inferiority (see below).

Additional efficacy analyses 
1.  
Efficacy Using Randomized Protocol-Qualified Analysis Population: 
Additional  analyses  were  performed  on  the  protocol-qualified  (PQ)  population,  which  includes 
patients  who  had  eligible  study  disease,  did  not  take  prohibited  anticancer  therapy,  had  baseline 
lesions, and received at least 1 dose of study treatment. Of the 1725 patients randomized in this study, 
1666 were qualified for the PQ analyses (838 patients in the AC arm and 828 patients in the GC arm). 
Overall Survival  
For the PQ population, the median OS time was 10.38 months for the AC arm and 10.45 months for 
the GC arm. Using the Cox regression adjusted model, the non-inferiority test of H0 versus Ha was 
statistically  significant  (one-sided  p<0.001),  with  the  cofactor-adjusted  survival  HR  estimated  to  be 
0.94 (95% CI: 0.84 to 1.05). For sensitivity, an unadjusted estimate of the analysis of the survival HR 
was found to be similar (HR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.04), with a non-inferiority p-value of <0.0001.  
Progression Free survival: 
-  Unadjusted HR: 1.04279 ( 0.94432-1.15152), non-inferiority p=0.0086 
-  Adjusted HR: 1.04148 (0.94309-1.15015), non-inferiority p=0.008 
Time to progressive disease: 
-  Unadjusted HR: 1.05100 ( 0.94574-1.16798), non-inferiority p=0.0181 
-  Adjusted HR: 1.03828 (0.93419-1.15398), non-inferiority p=0.010 
Time-to-treatment failure: 
-  Unadjusted HR: 1.06126 ( 0.92777-1.21396), non-inferiority p=0.0665 
-  Adjusted HR: 1.05327 (0.92075-1.20486), non-inferiority p=0.053 
2.  
Independently-Reviewed Progression-Free Survival: 
A  pre-planned  limited  independent  central  review  of  imaging  for  determination  of  objective 
progressive disease was conducted on a subset of 400 patients randomly selected from the first 1000 
patients  enrolled.    The  purpose  of  this  independent  review  was  to  look  for  any  evidence  of  a 
systematic bias in investigator assessments of progressive disease in terms of the relative efficacy of 
the 2 treatment arms.  As pre-specified in the Statistical Analysis Plan, if the 2 estimates for HR were 
found  to  be  similar,  then  there  would  be  no  significant  bias  from  investigator-assessed  data,  and 
therefore  an  evaluation  to  assess  agreement  and  discordance  between  independently  reviewed  and 
investigator-reviewed PFS would not be necessary. Of the 400 patients sampled for review, 333 had 
reviewable scans. The independent review of 333 patients was consistent with the overall investigator 
assessment of PFS.

Subgroup Analyses Defined by Baseline Characteristics 
Preplanned  subgroup  analyses  of  OS  were  performed  using  Cox  and  Kaplan-Meier  methods. 
Subgroups were  analyzed separately as defined by the following factors: disease stage, performance 
status,  sex,  basis  for  initial  pathological  diagnosis,  smoking  status,  age,  ethnic  origin,  and  NSCLC 
histology.  
The  effect  on  survival  of  AC  relative  to  GC  was  similar  for  disease  and  patient  characteristics; 
however, a differential effect on survival was seen within histologic groups.

After observing differences in the survival hazard ratios for adenocarcinoma, large cell, and squamous 
cell carcinoma subgroups, a statistical test was performed to assess whether a treatment-by-histology 
interaction was present.  
Since there  was the potential for imbalances between  arms  with respect to  prognostic factors within 
histologic groups, this interaction test was performed using a Cox model of OS with main effects for 
assigned  treatment  arm,  histology  (adenocarcinoma,  large  cell  carcinoma,  squamous  cell  carcinoma, 
and other histology as 3 indicator variables), and baseline cofactors of performance status (ECOG PS), 
disease stage, gender, and basis for pathological diagnosis, plus the treatment-by-histology interaction. 
The  interaction  was  found  to  be  statistically  significant  (p=0.0058),  indicating  that  there  was  a 
significant treatment-by-histology interaction.  
Page 25 of 36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Evaluating  this  interaction  as  a  two-level  histology  variable  as  squamous  versus  non-squamous  also 
resulted in a significant interaction (p=0.0024).  
In addition, analyses of PFS and response rate for histologic subgroups were generally consistent with 
the efficacy results shown on overall survival. There were trends for AC to perform better than GC in 
adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma. In squamous cell carcinoma, GC tended to perform better 
than AC for both PFS and response rate.  
An analysis of overall survival with censoring at PDT was performed upon request by the CHMP, and 
the censoring rate was much higher for this analysis (74% for AC and 76% for GC) than was observed 
for PFS. The adjusted HR for this analysis (n=1722) was 1.06 (95% CI: 0.90 to 1.24), and the median 
survival was 14.2 months for AC versus 13.6 months for GC. With such a high censoring rate, in this 
case greater than 70%, this analysis is not informative and therefore no conclusions can be drawn, as 
the estimates are based on very few events. 
The  table  below  shows  the  analyses  of  overall  survival  excluding  patients  who  crossed  over  to  the 
alternate  treatment  (pemetrexed  plus  cisplatin  [AC]  to  gemcitabine-containing  therapy  [G]  or 
gemcitabine  plus  cisplatin  [GC]  to  pemetrexed-containing  therapy  [A]),  received  drug-based  post-
discontinuation therapy (PDT), and did not receive any drug-based PDT, for the combined subgroups 
of adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma.

As shown above, the combined subgroups of patients with adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma 
showed  a  survival  advantage  for  patients  treated  with  Alimta  in  all  categories.    The  results  were 
consistent, with superiority of survival of AC over GC in nearly all analyses, except for the group of 
patients  who  did  not  receive  PDT.    In  the  subset  of  patients  who  did  not  receive  PDT,  the  smaller 
medians  likely  reflect  the  poorer  survival  of  this  group  of  patients;  they  may  not  have  lived  long 
enough to have had the opportunity to receive PDT.  In each of these analyses, the hazard ratio favours 
AC, and the upper CI is well below the non-inferiority margin of 1.17647.   
During  the  procedure,  the  CHMP  also  requested  the  analyses  above  be  provided  for  the  Protocol-
Qualified (PQ) population.

Discussion on Clinical Efficacy 
In the pivotal Study JMDB, patients were randomized to receive 6 cycles of pemetrexed plus cisplatin 
(AC) or gemcitabine plus cisplatin (GC) combination therapy, as follows: 
Experimental Arm A: 
Control Arm B: 
pemetrexed  500  mg/m2  plus  cisplatin  75  mg/m2  on  Day  1 
every 21 days. 
gemcitabine 1250 mg/m2 on Day 1 and Day 8 plus cisplatin 
75 mg/m2 on Day 1 every 21 days. 
Demographic and tumour characteristics at baseline were well balanced: a total of 1725 patients were 
enrolled into the study. Of the enrolled patients, 862 patients were randomized to the AC arm, and 863 
patients were randomized to the GC arm. Approximately 70% of the patients were men. The median 
age of 61 years with a wide age range (26 years to 83 years). At study entry, 24% of patients had Stage 
IIIB disease and approximately 76% of patients had Stage IV disease.  Approximately 36% of patients 
had an ECOG performance status (PS) of 0, and 64% of patients had an ECOG PS of 1.  The arms 
were well balanced with respect to these well-established prognostic factors, as well as age, history of 
tobacco use, and histological type (adenocarcinoma  about 50%, squamous cell carcinoma about one 
third, large cell carcinoma about 8%, and other histologies about 15%). 
The primary efficacy analysis was a non-inferiority analysis of Overall Survival (OS) for patients 
treated with AC compared to patients treated with GC based on the ITT population.  A non-inferiority 
fixed margin of 1.17647 was used, which corresponded to GC having a 15% lower hazard than that of 
AC, and was tested at a one-sided 0.025 alpha level. 
This non-inferiority margin may appear large and does not exclude a significant disadvantage when 
using pemetrexed in the claimed indication. However, a significant tightening of this margin would 
have resulted in an unrealistic increase in the sample size. More importantly, this margin has to be 
interpreted in the light of the point estimate and taking into account the respective safety profiles of 
the compared regimens.  
The median OS time was 10.28 months for both treatment arms. The 1 and 2-year survival rates were 
43.48% and 18.94%, respectively, for the AC arm and 41.94% and 13.98%, respectively, for the GC 
arm.

Using the Cox regression adjusted model for the primary analysis, the primary non-inferiority test was 
statistically significant (one-sided p<0.001), with the primary cofactor-adjusted survival HR estimated 
to be 0.94 (95% CI: 0.84 to 1.05), with the entire confidence interval for HR well below the 1.17645 
non-inferiority margin.  
The unadjusted estimate of the survival HR was HR = 0.93; 95% CI: 0.83 to 1.04, with a non-
inferiority p-value of <0.001.  
Thus, study JMDB demonstrated non-inferiority of AC as compared to GC in terms of overall survival 
when administered as first line treatment in patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic (stage 
IIIB or IV) NSCLC. The result is rather robust and mature. Reassuring is, in addition, a trend towards 
improved OS for AC at the end of the Kaplan-Meier curve. 
Further, the overall result with reference to the primary endpoint is reflected also in the results for the 
secondary efficacy endpoints.  
As study JMDB is a non-inferiority study, efficacy analyses need to be based on the protocol-qualified 
(PQ)  population.  In  study  JMDB,  the  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  based  on  the  ITT  population. 
Sensitivity analyses of main efficacy endpoints were also assessed on the PQ population. The efficacy 
analyses using the PQ population follow the same trend as the efficacy analyses for the ITT population 
and support the non-inferiority of AC versus GC.  
However,  although  this  non-inferior  efficacy  has  been  demonstrated  in  the  overall  group  of  patients 
with  NSCLC,  pre-planned  subgroup  analyses  showed  that  a  qualitative  interaction  exists  between 
NSCLC histology and treatment effect, with a benefit of AC in patients with adenocarcinoma or large 
cell carcinoma, and a benefit of GC in patients with squamous cell carcinoma.

Regarding  patients  with  squamous  cell  carcinoma,  the  non-inferiority  of  AC  has  not  been

suggesting  that  AC  is  inferior  to  GC.  Considering  that  patients  with  a  squamous  cell  carcinoma 
histological  subtype  represent  one  third  of  the  patients  in  both  arms  (453/1725),  the  efficacy  results 
preclude an indication of AC in this population.  
Regarding  patients  with  adenocarcinoma  and  large  cell  carcinoma,  the  non-inferiority  of  AC  was 
demonstrated,  as  the  upper  side  of  the  95%  CI  for  these  populations  falls  well  below  the  non-
inferiority margin of 1.17647. The additional sensitivity analyses on OS provided by the MAH during 
the procedure also confirm the previously demonstrated non-inferiority of AC vs. GC in patients with 
adenocarcinoma  and  large  cell  carcinoma  histologies.  They  also  provide  reassurance  that  non-
inferiority is not due to post-discontinuation treatment.  
Clinical Safety  
In the pivotal JMDB study, the safety profile of AC in NSCLC was consistent with the known safety 
profile of AC in mesothelioma.  In terms of safety, AC can be considered as slightly safer than GC 
taking into account the better haematotoxicity profile and the slightly worse nephrotoxicity profile of 
AC vs. GC.  There were no clinically relevant differences observed for the safety profile of ALIMTA 
plus cisplatin within the histology subgroups. 
A total of 3648 cycles of AC were administered to 839 patients in the AC arm, and 3626 cycles of GC 
were administered to 830 patients in the GC arm. A median of 5 cycles of therapy was administered to 
patients in both arms.  
Dose adjustments (delays, reductions, and omissions)  were less frequent in patients treated with AC 
compared to patients treated with GC.  
The total number of dose delays (any reason) reported was 815 in the AC arm, and 929 in the GC arm. 
Scheduling conflict was the  most commonly reported reason for dose delays in both treatment arms 
(486  in  the  AC  arm  and  514  in  the  GC  arm).  In  both  treatment  arms,  the  most  commonly  reported 
adverse events resulting in dose delays were neutropenia (138 in the AC arm and 188 in the GC arm) 
and anaemia (25 in the AC arm and 43 in the GC arm). 
In  the  AC  arm,  the  most  common  reasons  for  dose  reductions  were  neutropenia  (17  for  pemetrexed 
and 17 for cisplatin), fatigue (6 for pemetrexed and 8 for cisplatin), nausea (5 for pemetrexed and 8 for 
cisplatin), and febrile neutropenia (5 for pemetrexed and 5 for cisplatin). 
In the GC arm, the most common reasons for dose reductions were neutropenia (184 for gemcitabine 
and  59  for  cisplatin),  thrombocytopenia  (82  for  gemcitabine  and  37  for  cisplatin),  and  febrile 
neutropenia  (15  for  gemcitabine  and  12  for  cisplatin).  Dose  omissions  were  permitted  per  protocol 
only for Day 8 gemcitabine.

Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) 
The percentage of patients experiencing any possibly study-drug related TEAEs (reported in ≥10% of 
all randomized and treated patients) was similar in both treatment arms: 751 patients (89.5%) in the 
AC arm and 755 patients (91.0%) in the GC arm. In both treatment arms, the most commonly reported 
possibly study-drug related TEAEs were anaemia, neutropenia, nausea, vomiting, and fatigue. The GC 
arm had more categories of TEAEs that were statistically higher as compared to the AC arm. Patients 
in  the  GC  arm  experienced  statistically  significantly  more  anaemia,  neutropenia,  thrombocytopenia, 
fatigue,  pyrexia,  febrile  neutropenia,  alopecia,  hypokalaemia,  neuropathy,  peripheral  sensory 
neuropathy, tinnitus, and epistaxis than patients on the AC arm.  
Eye  disorders  as  a  whole  (mostly  conjunctivitis  and  increased  lacrimation),  acute  renal  failure,  dry 
skin, and pigmentation disorder occurred in significantly more patients on the AC arm. 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
139  patients  in  the  AC  arm  (16.6%)  and  136  patients  in  the  GC  arm  (16.4%)  experienced  possibly 
related SAEs. Possibly study-drug related serious febrile neutropenia and pyrexia occurred statistically 
significantly more often in the GC arm, whereas anorexia and acute renal failure occurred statistically 
more  often  in  the  AC  arm.  12  patients  in  the  AC  arm  and  6  patients  in  the  GC  arm  had  a  possibly 
study-drug related renal-failure SAE. 
In the AC arm, 11/12 cases presented evidence of gastrointestinal toxicity and/or dehydration prior to 
developing  renal  failure,  and  6/12  cases  presented  pre-existing  conditions  and  historical  illnesses 
associated with renal impairment.  
The nature and severity of the acute renal failure seen in the AC arm of this study is consistent with 
the  known  safety  profile  of  the  combination  as  described  in  the  current  product  information.  Renal 
failure  was  primarily  pre-renal  in  nature  due  to  dehydration  induced  by  gastrointestinal  toxicity  or 
sepsis. 
Note: Table JMDB.12.14 summarizes the possibly study-drug related SAEs that were experienced by 
>=2%  of  patients  or  were  statistically  significantly  different  between  study  arms  or  were  otherwise 
clinically significant. 
Discontinuation 
15 patients (1.8%) in the AC arm and 23 patients (2.8%) in the GC arm discontinued study treatment 
due to SAEs that were considered to be possibly related to the study drug. Except for cerebrovascular 
Page 30 of 36 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
accident  (AC:  0.1%,  GC:  0.8%;  p=0.038),  there  were  no  significant  differences  in  the  numbers  of 
patients who discontinued study drug, regardless of causality, between treatment arms. 
57  patients  (6.8%)  in  the  AC  arm  and  60  patients  (7.2%)  in  the  GC  arm  discontinued  due  to  non 
serious, clinically significant adverse events considered to be possibly related to the study drug. 
Among  the  discontinuations  possibly  related  to  the  study  drug,  increased  blood  creatinine  caused 
significantly  more  discontinuations  in  the  AC  arm  than  in  the  GC  arm  (p=0.004).  Haematologic 
toxicity  (anaemia,  thrombocytopenia,  and  neutropenia)  caused  more  discontinuations  in  the  GC  arm 
than in the AC arm. 
Grade 3/4 toxicities 
Patients in the GC arm experienced statistically significantly more Grade 3 and 4 laboratory toxicities 
than  patients  in  the  AC  arm  (39.9%  versus  22.6%,  p<0.001).  In  both  treatment  arms,  the  most 
frequently  reported  Grade  3/4  toxicity  was  neutropenia,  which  was  reported  in  statistically 
significantly more patients in the GC arm than in the AC arm (26.7% versus 15.1%, p<0.001). Other 
Grade 3/4 toxicities experienced by significantly more patients in the GC arm than in the AC arm were 
also haematologic and included anaemia (9.9% versus 5.6%, p<0.001), leucopenia (7.6% versus 4.8%, 
p<0.001), and thrombocytopenia (12.7% versus 4.1%, p<0.001). 
When  CTC  Grades  1  through  4  are  considered,  the  incidence  of  elevated  creatinine  is  statistically 
significantly higher in the AC arm than in the GC arm (10.1% versus 6.9%, p=0.018). 
Overall, patients in the GC arm experienced similar Grade 3 and 4 non-laboratory toxicities as patients 
in the AC arm (23.5% versus 21.5%, p=0.320).  
Patients  in  the  AC  arm  experienced  statistically  significantly  more  study-drug  related  Grade  3/4 
anorexia (2.4% versus 0.7%, p=0.009) and nausea (7.2% versus 3.9%, p=0.004).  
Possibly study-drug related Grade 3/4 febrile neutropenia occurred in statistically significantly more 
patients in the GC arm than in the AC arm (3.7% versus 1.3%, p=0.002). 
Deaths 
A total of 116 on-therapy deaths were reported: 63 deaths in the AC arm and 53 deaths in the GC arm. 
These events are categorized as due to study disease, possibly related to study-drug toxicity, and due 
to  other  causes.  For  any  category,  the  difference  in  the  number  of  deaths  was  not  statistically 
significant between study arms.  
In the AC arm, 9 on-therapy deaths were considered by the investigator to be possibly due to study-
drug toxicity, whereas in the GC arm, 6 on-therapy deaths were considered by the investigator to be 
possibly due to study-drug toxicity.  
There were 61 cases of deaths due to other causes, 31 on the AC arm and 30 on the GC arm. Overall, 
the  most  commonly  reported  reasons  for  deaths  due  to  other  causes  were  pulmonary  events  and 
cardiac events. 
A total of 27 deaths were reported within 30 days of last study drug dose: 13 deaths in the AC arm and 
14 deaths in the GC arm.  
A review undertaken by the MAH of patient summaries found possibly study-drug related causes for 
death in 1 additional patient in the AC arm and 4 additional patients in the GC arm, for a total of 10 
deaths possibly due to study-drug toxicity in each arm.

Discussion on Clinical Safety 
Overall, the safety profile of AC in NSCLC was consistent with the known safety profile of AC in 
mesothelioma.  In terms of safety, AC can be considered as slightly safer than GC taking into account 
the better haematotoxicity profile and the slightly worse nephrotoxicity profile of AC vs. GC.  There 
were no clinically relevant differences observed for the safety profile of ALIMTA plus cisplatin within 
the histology subgroups. 
The  GC  arm  presented  a  statistically  higher  hematological  toxicity  as  compared  to  the  AC  arm 
responsible for discontinuation and Grade 3/4 toxicities. 
On the other hand, renal toxicity was numerically higher in the AC arm compared to GC arm. 
Despite the overall higher toxicity in the GC arm than in the AC arm, the death cases in the AC arm 
are  of  great  interest,  reflecting  the  known  safety  profile  of  the  pemetrexed/cisplatin  regimen:  more 
deaths due to infection (2 septic shock, 1 sepsis and 1 neutropenia) in the AC arm as compared to GC

arm (1 septicemia); death due to gastro-intestinal toxicity (sigmoides perforation and bleeding gastric); 
death related to renal toxicity (renal failure and elevated creatinine and urea levels).  
Further, although reported as unrelated to the study drug, the 14 death cases classified as pulmonary 
causes are of great interest, although these were similar in number to the 9 death cases classified as 
pulmonary causes reported on the GC arm. There were no statistically significant differences between 
the AC and GC arms in terms of number of deaths reported for study disease, drug toxicity, or “other 
causes.” 
The cases of death reported among the ‘on-therapy deaths’ in the AC arm are in accordance with the 
seriousness of adverse events mentioned in the SPC of Alimta, and consistent with the known safety 
profile of pemetrexed when combined with cisplatin.  
Pharmacovigilance 
The severity of toxicities (grade 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations, thrombocytopenia, and rash) which 
were higher in the pemetrexed arm (in study JMEI) will be closely monitored and reported within 
future PSURs. 
All the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have been included in the SPC. 
The CHMP does not consider that any change to the PSUR cycle is necessary following this extension 
of indication.  
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
(cid:131) 
(cid:131) 
routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. 
no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information.  
Benefit-risk assessment 
Lung cancer is among the most frequent type of cancer among European men and women and is one 
of  the  few  that  continues  to  show  an  increasing  incidence.  Non  small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC) 
accounts  for  the  vast  majority  of  lung  cancers  (80%).  Surgery  is  the  preferred  treatment  of  patients 
with  early  disease.  However,  more  than  60-65%  of  patients  present  with  a  locally  advanced  (stage 
IIIB) or metastatic disease (stage IV) and are not suitable for surgery. 
The  current  standard  of  first-line  treatment  in  patients  with  advanced  disease  consists  of  platinum-
based  doublet  regimens  (combination  of  gemcitabine,  vinorelbine,  doectaxel,  or  paclitaxel  with 
cisplatin  or  carboplatin)  where  1-year  survival  rates  of  33%  and  2-year  survival  rates  of  11%  have 
been reported. 
This application for a type II variation to extend the indication of Alimta to include first line treatment 
of  patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  NSCLC  is  supported  by  a  well-managed  and  well-
analysed pivotal non-inferiority phase III trial, JMDB. 
Study JMDB demonstrated non-inferiority of AC as compared to GC in terms of overall survival when 
administered as first line treatment in patients with advanced unresectable or metastatic (stage IIIB or 
IV) NSCLC. The result is rather robust and mature. In addition, a trend towards improved OS for AC 
at the end of the Kaplan-Meier curve is reassuring. 
The  overall  result  with  reference  to  the  primary  endpoint  is  reflected  also  in  the  results  for  the 
secondary efficacy endpoints.  
In study JMDB, the primary efficacy analysis was based on the ITT population. Sensitivity analyses of 
main  efficacy  endpoints  were  also  assessed  on  the  protocol-qualified  (PQ)  population.  The  efficacy 
analyses using the PQ population follow the same trend as the efficacy analyses in the ITT population 
and support the non-inferiority of AC versus GC.

In  terms  of  safety,  AC  can  be  considered  as  slightly  safer  than  GC  taking  into  account  the  better 
haematotoxicity  profile  (statistically  significantly  different)  and  the  slightly  worse  nephrotoxicity 
profile of AC vs. GC. 
As  the  comparator  GC  is  a  widely  accepted  standard  treatment  in  advanced  NSCLC,  it  could  have 
been concluded that the benefit/risk assessment of AC in the overall population of NSCLC patients is 
positive.  However,  the  sub-group  analyses  of  the  treatment  effect  by  histology  revealed  a  strong 
signal. 
Retrospective sub-group analyses of two preceding trials investigating pemetrexed as monotherapy in 
second line treatment of NSCLC (Studies JMEI and NS01, the first part of the original MAA and the 
second a randomised, dose-optimising trial discussed above) indicated lower efficacy of Alimta in the 
histological  sub-group  squamous  cell  carcinoma.  Furthermore,  the  prospectively  planned  sub-group 
analysis by histology of trial JMDB confirmed lower efficacy also in the context of the combination 
treatment.  Similarly,  analyses  in  Studies  JMEI  and  NS01  indicated  higher  efficacy  of  Alimta  in 
patients  with  NSCLC  other  than  predominantly  squamous  cell  histology,  and  the  prospectively 
planned subgroup analysis in JMDB confirmed higher efficacy for AC in this population . 
Therefore, the CHMP concluded that the benefit/risk ratio of AC in squamous cell NSCLC is clearly 
negative since  GC offered prolonged survival compared to AC. However, the benefit/risk ratio in the 
remainder  NSCLC  population  without  predominantly  squamous  cell  histology,  i.e.  in  patients  with 
adenocarcinoma  or  large  cell  NSCLC,  is  clearly  positive,  where  AC  offers  prolonged  survival 
compared to GC.  
In  view  of  the  outcome  of  the  CHMP’s  benefit/risk  assessment,  the  MAH  proposed  during  the 
procedure to limit the current second line monotherapy indication accordingly and the following final 
wording of the NSCLC indication in section 4.1 of the SPC was agreed: 
“Non-small cell lung cancer 
ALIMTA in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the first line treatment of patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous 
cell histology (see section 5.1). 
ALIMTA is indicated as monotherapy for the second line treatment of patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell 
histology (see section 5.1).” 
Section 5.1 of the SPC has been updated to reflect the results of the pivotal study JMDB in first line 
NSCLC. In addition, the information regarding second line NSCLC has been updated and a statement 
added  to  reflect  the  results  of  study  JMGX  investigating  the  efficacy  of  pemetrexed  after  first  line 
treatment with docetaxel.   
As the posology of the newly studied combination treatment in first line NSCLC is the  same  as the 
posology already granted for the treatment of mesothelioma, and in view of the experience gained in 
Study JMDB and the post-marketing setting with Alimta, the MAH proposes to provide in section 4.2 
of  the  SPC  a  single  dosage  recommendation  for  the  use  of  Alimta  in  combination  with  cisplatin  as 
well  as  a  single  table  for  dose  modifications  applicable  to  both  monotherapy  and  combination 
treatment.  
In addition, Common Toxicity Criteria have been clarified in section 4.2 and section 4.8 of the SPC 
and section 4 of the Package Leaflet for all indications.  
All the proposed consequential changes to sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC and the Package 
Leaflet can be agreed.

In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to include a minor clarification in section 4.5 regarding 
concomitant use with yellow fever vaccine and to make minor editorial  changes to the SPC and 
Package Leaflet and these changes are acceptable.  
During the procedure, the MAH also submitted the results of user testing of the Package Leaflet and 
these results were reviewed by the Committee and considered acceptable. 
With reference to the safety database, all adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-
marketing have been included in the SPC. The CHMP did not consider that any change to the current 
PSUR cycle was necessary following this extension of indication. However, the severity of toxicities 
(grade 3 and 4 ALT and AST elevations, thrombocytopenia, and rash) which were higher in the 
pemetrexed arm (in study JMEI) will be closely monitored and reported within future PSURs. 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
(cid:131) 
(cid:131) 
routine pharmacovigilance was adequate to monitor the safety of the product. 
no additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information.  
The MAH has updated annex IIB to reflect the latest Pharmacovigilance system (version 2.0) and Risk 
Management Plan (version 1.2) approved by the CHMP, which is acceptable. 
IV.  CONCLUSION 
On 21 February 2008 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II  and  Package 
Leaflet.

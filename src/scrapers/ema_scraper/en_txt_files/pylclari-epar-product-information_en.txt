4.2  Posology and method of administration 
This medicinal product is for use in designated nuclear medicine facilities only and should only be 
handled by authorised personnel. 
Posology 
The mean recommended activity of (18F) piflufolastat is 4 MBq/kg of body weight and can vary from 
3 to 5 MBq/kg of body weight depending on the PET equipment and acquisition mode used. The 
minimum activity should not fall below 190 MBq and the maximum activity should not exceed 
360 MBq. 
Renal impairment / Hepatic impairment 
Piflufolastat (18F) has only been studied in patients with mild renal impairment. Careful consideration 
of the activity to be administered is required since an increased radiation exposure is possible in 
patients with severe impaired renal function. 
Piflufolastat (18F) has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of piflufolastat (18F) in the paediatric population. 
Method of administration 
It is administered by a single intravenous injection. 
Pylclari is presented in multidose vial. The minimal volume is 0.5 mL of solution per vial. 
The volume of solution to be administered can range from 0.2 mL to 10 mL. 
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product 
For instruction before administration, see section 6.6. 
For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 12. 
Image acquisition 
It is recommended to position the patient supine with arms above the head. A non contrast-enhanced 
low-dose CT scan is performed from the vertex of the skull through mid-thigh for attenuation 
correction and anatomic correlation. The PET acquisition is performed from mid-thigh through the 
vertex of the skull, starting 90 to 120 minutes after tracer injection. It must include lower extremities if 
there is known or suspected disease. Image acquisition duration is 12 to 40 minutes depending on the 
type of PET cameras, number of bed positions (typically 6 to 8) and acquisition time per bed position 
(typically 2 minutes to 5 minutes). If the acquisition leads to indeterminate findings, and provided a 
sufficient activity remains for adequate counting statistics, late acquisitions can also be performed, 
thus reducing background activity. 
For patient preparation, see section 4.4.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Potential for hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions 
If hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions occur, the administration of the medicinal product must be 
discontinued immediately and intravenous treatment initiated, if necessary. To enable immediate 
action in emergencies, the necessary medicinal products and equipment such as endotracheal tube and 
ventilator must be immediately available. 
Individual benefit/risk justification 
For each patient, the radiation exposure must be justifiable by the likely benefit. The activity 
administered should, in every case, be as low as reasonably achievable to obtain the required 
diagnostic information. 
Renal impairment 
Careful consideration of the benefit risk ratio in these patients is required since an increased radiation 
exposure is possible. 
Paediatric population 
For information on the use in paediatric population, see section 4.2. 
Patient preparation 
The patient should be well hydrated before the start of the examination and urged to void before the 
examination in order to reduce bladder activity and as often as possible during the first hours after the 
examination in order to reduce radiation exposure. 
A diuretic expected to act within the uptake time period may be administered to improve interpretation 
of piflufolastat (18F) PET/CT as it results in less activity depositions in ureters and the bladder. 
After the procedure 
Close contact with infants and pregnant women should be restricted during the initial 12 hours 
following the injection. 
Interpretation of piflufolastat (18F) images 
The recommended method for PET images interpretation with piflufolastat (18F) PET/CT is the visual 
interpretation. 
Lesions should be considered suspicious if uptake is greater than physiologic uptake in that tissue or 
greater than adjacent background if no physiologic uptake is expected. 
Piflufolastat (18F) accumulates in normal tissue where the density of PSMA is high including the 
lacrimal glands, salivary glands, liver, spleen, and kidneys. Normal organs demonstrate significant 
variability in the uptake of piflufolastat (18F); however, the impact of tumor burden on normal uptake 
is minimal and unlikely to be clinically significant. The expression of PSMA can predominantly be 
found in prostate cancer, but can also be observed in other neoplasms (e.g. renal cell carcinoma, 
hepatocarcinoma, breast cancer, lung cancer and other malignancies) or non-malignant conditions (e.g 
hemangioma, ganglia, since they can mimic lymph nodes, benign bone disease as Paget’s disease, or 
pulmonary sarcoidosis/granulomatosis).

Images should be interpreted only by readers trained in the interpretation of PET images with 
piflufolastat (18F). 
Clinical correlation, which may include histopathological evaluation of the suspected prostate cancer 
site, is recommended. A negative image does not rule out the presence of prostate cancer and a 
positive image does not confirm the presence of prostate cancer. 
Piflufolastat (18F) was not studied for detection of distant metastases in primary staging. 
The performance of piflufolastat (18F) for imaging of patients with biochemical evidence of recurrence 
of prostate cancer seems to be affected by serum PSA levels (see section 5.1). The performance of 
piflufolastat (18F) for imaging of metastatic pelvic lymph nodes prior to initial definitive therapy seems 
to be affected by risk factors such as Gleason score. 
Small lymph nodes metastases, or any lesion under spatial resolution of PET (= 5 mm) may be missed 
by piflufolastat (18F)  PET/CT. 
To date no outcome data exist to support subsequent management of patients based on PSMA-PET in 
the primary staging. Therefore, treatment should not be changed based on piflufolastat (18F)  PET/CT 
findings only. 
Specific warnings 
This medicinal product contains up to 3.5 mg sodium per mL equivalent to 0.2 % to the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
This medicinal product contains up to 900 mg of alcohol (ethanol) in each administration which is 
equivalent to 90 mg per mL. The amount in 10 mL of this medicinal product is equivalent to less than 
23 mL of beer or 11 mL of wine. 
The small amount of alcohol in this medicinal product will not have any noticeable effects. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and other therapies targeting the androgen pathway, such as 
androgen receptor antagonists, may result in changes in uptake of piflufolastat (18F) in prostate cancer. 
The effect of these therapies on performance of piflufolastat (18F) PET has not been established. 
Chronic treatment with diuretics does not seem to have any interference with piflufolastat (18F) for 
interpretation of images.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
A total of 108 treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were reported in 69 (8.6 %) patients, with 
headache (1.4 %), dysgeusia (1.0 %), and fatigue (0.5 %) being the most frequent. Three serious drug-
related adverse events (hypersensitivity, headache, and paresthesia) were reported, all experienced by

one patient and only hypersensitivity was assessed as drug-related in this patient who had a significant 
history of allergic reactions. All three serious drug-related adverse events were resolved. 
Exposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of 
hereditary defects. 
As the effective dose is 4.2 mSv when the maximal recommended activity of 360 MBq is administered 
in a 70 kg-weighted patient, these adverse reactions are expected to occur with a low probability. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
The maximum amount of piflufolastat (18F) injection that can be safely administered to humans has 
not been determined. 
In the event of administration of a radiation overdose, the absorbed dose to the patient should be 
reduced where possible by increasing the elimination of the radionuclide from the body by forced 
diuresis and frequent bladder voiding. It might be helpful to estimate the effective dose that was 
applied.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic  group:  Diagnostic  radiopharmaceuticals,  other  diagnostic  radiopharmaceuticals 
for tumour detection, ATC code: V09IX16. 
Mechanism of action 
Prostate-Specific Membrane Antigen (PSMA), is a trans-membrane glycoprotein primarily expressed 
in normal human prostate epithelium at low levels, but may be overexpressed by malignant tissues, 
particularly by prostate cancer cells, including metastatic disease. Fluorine (18F) is a β+ emitting 
radionuclide that enables positron emission tomography. Piflufolastat (18F) is a selective second-
generation fluorine-18-labeled small-molecule PSMA inhibitor. Based on the intensity of the signals, 
PET images obtained using piflufolastat (18F) indicate the presence of PSMA expressing tissues. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
At the chemical concentrations used for diagnostic examinations, this medicinal product does not 
appear to have any pharmacodynamic activity. 
Clinical efficacy 
The safety and efficacy of piflufolastat (18F) were evaluated in three prospective, open-label, multi-
center clinical studies in men with prostate cancer: OSPREY (NCT02981368), CONDOR 
(NCT03739684), and PYTHON (EudraCT number 2020-000121-37). 
OSPREY cohort A enrolled a cohort of 268 men with high-risk biopsy-proven prostate cancer who 
were considered candidates for radical prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection. Each patient

received a single piflufolastat (18F)  PET/CT from mid-thigh to skull vertex. Three central independent 
readers blinded to all clinical information interpreted each PET scan for the presence of abnormal 
uptake in pelvic lymph nodes in multiple subregions, including the common iliac lymph nodes. Co-
primary endpoints were specificity and sensitivity of piflufolastat (18F) PET/CT against histopathology 
within the pelvic lymph nodes. Secondary endpoints were Positive Predictive Value (PPV) and 
Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of piflufolastat (18F) PET/CT to predict the presence or absence 
respectively of prostate cancer within the prostate gland and lymph nodes in Cohort A. 
A total of 252 patients (94 %) underwent prostatectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection and had 
sufficient histopathology data for evaluation of the pelvic lymph nodes. Surgical specimens were 
separated into three regions: left hemipelvis, right hemipelvis, and other. For each patient, 
piflufolastat (18F) PET/CT results and histopathology results obtained from dissected pelvic lymph 
nodes were compared by surgical region. PET/CT results in locations that were not dissected were 
excluded from analysis. For the 252 evaluable patients, the mean age was 64 years (range 46 to 
84 years). The median serum PSA was 9.3 ng/mL. The total Gleason score was 7 for 19 %, 8 for 46 %, 
and 9 for 34 % of the patients, with the remainder of the patients having Gleason scores of 6 or 10. 
The pre-defined thresholds for the co-primary endpoints were 40 % for sensitivity and 80 % for 
specificity. Sensitivity did not reach statistical significance for at least 2 of the 3 independent imaging 
reviewers, therefore, it was considered a failed study. 
Table 2 shows piflufolastat (18F)  PET/CT performance by reader using pelvic lymph node 
histopathology as standard of truth, at the patient-level with region matching (one true positive region 
defines a true positive patient). Approximately 24% of the evaluable patients had pelvic lymph node 
metastases based on histopathology ( 95% confidence interval: 19 %, 29 %).

For primary staging (OSPREY Cohort A), high level reader agreement for pelvic lymph nodes 
metastases (92.5 %) was achieved with Fleiss’ kappa statistic of 0.78 (95 %CI: 0.71; 0.85). 
In exploratory analyses, there were numerical trends towards more true positive results among patients 
with total Gleason score of 8 or higher and among patients with tumor stage of T2c or higher relative 
to those patients with lower Gleason score or tumor stage. 
A  comparison  on  diagnostic  performance  of  piflufolastat  (18F)  PET/CT  with  baseline  conventional 
imaging (CI) in patients with high risk prostate cancer from Osprey Cohort A was performed as a post-
hoc  study.  Piflufolastat  (18F)  PET/CT  demonstrated  a  3-fold  higher  PPV  than  conventional  imaging 
(median 86.7 % vs. 28.3 %, respectively)  despite similar  sensitivity (median 40.3 % for piflufolastat 
(18F) PET/CT and 42.6 % for conventional imaging). Mean specificiy of piflufolastat (18F) PET/CT was 
97.9 % and 65.1 % for CI and mean NPV 83.2 % vs. 78.8 % respectively. 
CONDOR enrolled 208 patients with biochemical evidence of suspected recurrent prostate cancer 
after initial treatment (radical prostatectomy in 85 % of the patients). The median serum PSA was 
0.82 ng/mL. All enrolled patients had negative or equivocal for prostate cancer conventional imaging 
evaluation (for most patients, CT or MRI) within 60 days prior to receiving piflufolastat (18F). All

patients received a single PET/CT from mid-thigh to skull vertex with optional imaging of the lower 
extremities. Three independent central readers, blinded to all clinical information, evaluated each 
PET/CT scan for the presence and location of positive lesions. Location of each lesion was 
categorized into 5 regions (prostate/prostate bed, pelvic lymph nodes, other lymph nodes, soft tissue, 
bone). The primary endpoint was the correct localisation rate (CLR) at the patient level, defined as the 
percentage of patients for whom there was a one-to-one correspondence between localisation of at 
least one lesion identified on piflufolastat (18F) PET/CT imaging and the composite truth standard. If 
the lower bound of the 95 % CI was >0.2 (CLR of 20 %) for at least 2 of the 3 independent imaging 
reviewers, then the primary endpoint analysis was considered a success. The secondary endpoint was 
the impact on patient management (IMP) defined as the percentage of patients with a change in 
intended prostate cancer treatment plans due to piflufolastat (18F) PET/CT as measured by comparison 
of intended management questionnaires completed pre- and post- piflufolastat (18F) PET/CT imaging 
results. 
Depending on the reader, a total of 123 to 137 patients (59 % to 66 %) had at least one lesion that was 
identified as piflufolastat (18F)  PET-positive (Table 3). The region most commonly observed to have a 
PET-positive finding was pelvic lymph nodes (40 % to 42 % of all PET-positive regions) and the least 
common region was soft tissue (6 % to 7 %). 
Depending on the reader, 99 to 104 patients with a piflufolastat (18F)  PET-positive region had 
location-matched composite reference standard information that consisted of histopathology, imaging 
(CT, MRI, ultrasound, fluciclovine (18F)  PET, choline PET, or bone scan) obtained within 60 days of 
the PET/CT scan, or response of serum PSA level to targeted radiotherapy. Table 3 shows patient-
level performance results of piflufolastat (18F)  PET/CT by reader, including location-matched positive 
predictive value, also known as Correct Localization Rate (CLR). A patient was considered true 
positive if they had at least one matching location positive on both piflufolastat (18F)  PET/CT and the 
composite reference standard.

Table 4 shows patient-level piflufolastat (18F)  PET/CT results from the majority read stratified by 
serum PSA level. Percent PET positivity was calculated as the proportion of patients with a positive 
PET/CT out of all patients scanned. The likelihood of a patient having at least one piflufolastat (18F) 
PET-positive lesion generally increased with higher serum PSA level.

For the 207 patients with medical management questionnaires completed by treating physicians at pre-
and post-PSMA imaging, 64 % (131/207) of patients had a change in intended management after 
piflufolastat (18F) PET/CT. Of the patients with changed clinical plans, 79 % (103/131) were due to 
positive PSMA PET/CT findings, and 21 % (28/131) were due to negative scans. The most frequent 
changes were from salvage local therapy to systemic therapy (58 patients), from observation to 
initiating any therapy (49 patients), from noncurative systemic therapy to salvage local therapy 
(43 patients), and from planned treatment to observation (no treatment) (9 patients). 
PYTHON was a randomised, open-label, two-treatment cross-over study. It enrolled 217 male patients 
with first biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer, who underwent definitive therapy (radical 
prostatectomy (RP) ± extented lymph node dissection (eLND) in 73.2 % patients, EBRT or 
brachytherapy in 26.8 % patients). The primary endpoint was detection rate (DR) defined as number 
of patients defined as positive at patient level by the independent readers among the total number of 
patients assessed (for piflufolastat (18F) PET/CT and fluorocholine (18F) PET/CT). A significant 
difference of 12 % detection rate in favour of piflufolastat (18F) against Fluorocholine (18F) was pre-
defined. Secondary endpoints were sensitivity (ratio between the number of patients defined as 
positive for a given region by the independent readers and the total number of patients assessed as 
positive for a given region by the truth panel), concordance (ratio between the number of regions 
defined as positive by both piflufolastat (18F) PET/CT and Fluorocholine (18F) PET/CT + the number 
of regions defined as negative by both piflufolastat (18F) PET/CT and Fluorocholine (18F) PET/CT and 
the total number of assessed regions) and impact on patient management. 
Two-hundred one patients performed one piflufolastat (18F)  PET/CT and one fluorocholine (18F) 
PET/CT from mid-thigh to skull vertex in a randomised order. Three independent central readers, 
blinded to all clinical information, evaluated each piflufolastat (18F)  and each fluorocholine (18F) 
PET/CT for the presence and location of positive lesions. Location of each lesion was categorized into 
5 regions (prostate/prostate bed, pelvic lymph nodes, other lymph nodes, bone, soft tissue). Recurrence 
was detected by the blind read experts in 119 (60.4%) and 82 (41.0%) of the patients with piflufolastat 
(18F)  and fluorocholine (18F)  PET/CT, respectively. Details of overall independent reader’s 
interpretation by PSA level is given in Table 5.

The concordance rate between (18F)-piflufolastat PET/CT and (18F)-fluorocholine PET/CT according 
to central blind readers, per-region was remarkably high for all regions of interest, namely prostate 
bed: 87.3 % (81.9; 91.3), pelvic lymph nodes: 73.9 % (67.3; 79.5), extrapelvic lymph nodes: 86.5% 
(81.0; 90.6), bones: 86.9 % (81.5;91.0), and other organs: 92.0 % (87.3; 95.1). 
Regarding the localization of recurrence, the central readers achieved an agreement of 84.2% with a 
Fleiss' kappa statistic of 0.58 (95 % CI: 0.47; 0.70) for all biopsy images in OSPREY Cohort B. In 
CONDOR, the central readers exhibited 76% agreement in interpreting positive or negative 
piflufolastat (18F) PET/CT scans with a Fleiss' kappa statistic of 0.65 (95 % CI: 0.58; 0.73), while the 
concordance between each central reader and the local reader ranged from 83% to 84%. In PYTHON, 
the inter-reader agreement percentage was 67.8 %, and the corresponding Fleiss' kappa was 0.55 
(95 % CI: 0.47; 0.63). 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Pylclari in all subsets of the paediatric population in diagnosis of prostate cancer (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Distribution 
Blood levels decline in a biphasic fashion. The distribution half-life is 0.17 ± 0.04 hours and the 
elimination half-life is 3.47 ± 0.49 hours. 
Organ uptake 
Physiologic accumulation of piflufolastat (18F) is observed in the kidneys (16.5% of administered 
activity), liver (9.3 %), and lung (2.9 %), within 60 minutes of intravenous administration. Most of the 
remaining 70 % of activity at 60 minutes is with the rest of the body background region.

Elimination 
The only radioactive component detected in plasma samples by high-performance liquid 
chromatography (HPLC) up to 173 minutes post-injection was unchanged piflufolastat (18F). 
Elimination is by urinary excretion. In the first 8 hours post-injection, approximately 50% of 
administered radioactivity is excreted in the urine. 
Half-life 
The biological and effective half-life of piflufolastat (18F) are 3.47 ± 0.49 hours and approximately 70 
minutes, respectively. 
Renal/Hepatic impairment 
The pharmacokinetics in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not been characterised 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
An extended single dose toxicity study was conducted in rats with the non-radioactive pharmaceutical. 
No adverse reactions were observed in any of the animals, and no deaths occurred at the highest tested 
dose of 0.5 mg/kg. This dose is over 875-fold higher than the maximum clinical dose of 40 µg/patient 
(or 0.5714 µg/kg for a reference body weight of 70 kg); on a body surface area basis, this dose is 
approximately 142-fold higher, suggesting adequate safety margin. 
No other studies were conducted. 
This medicinal product is not intended for regular or continuous administration. At the chemical 
concentrations and the activities used for diagnostic examinations, additional studies does not appear 
to be necessary.

pharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken. 
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product 
This product is administered via an intravenous flexible catheter. The administration must be strictly 
intravenous in order to avoid irradiation as a result of local extravasation, as well as imaging artefacts. 
The bolus administration will be followed by a flush of 5-10 mL sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9 %) 
solution for injection, to ensure full delivery of the dose. 
For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 12. 
If at any time in the preparation of this medicinal product the integrity of the vial is compromised it 
should not be used. 
Administration procedures should be carried out in a way to minimise risk of contamination of the 
medicinal product and irradiation of the operators. Adequate shielding is mandatory. 
The administration of radiopharmaceuticals creates risks for other persons from external radiation or 
contamination from spill of urine, vomiting etc. Radiation protection precautions in accordance with 
national regulations must therefore be taken. 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements.

11.  DOSIMETRY 
Data listed below are from sponsored clinical studies. 
Assumptions: 
Fluorine (18F) decays to stable oxygen (18O) with a half-life of 110 minutes by emitting a positronic 
radiation of maximum energy of 634 keV, followed by photonic annihilation radiations of 511 keV. 
Piflufolastat (18F) exhibits bi-exponential behaviour in blood, with a distribution half-life of 
0.17 ± 0.044 hours and an elimination half-life of 3.47 ± 0.49 hours. It distributes to the kidneys 
(16.5 % of administered activity), liver (9.3 %), and lung (2.9 %), within minutes of intravenous 
administration. 
Methodology: 
The time-integrated activity in source tissue was obtained from longitudinal imaging data. Contours or 
volumes of interest (VOIs) were typically drawn around different activity-containing organs that were 
identified on each image at each time-point. The S-value was obtained by Monte Carlo simulation. 
The absorbed doses calculation was performed on OLINDA/EXM software (2005). The resulting 
effective dose was calculated according to ICRP 60.

1.  What Pylclari is and what it is used for 
This medicine is a radiopharmaceutical product for diagnostic use only. 
Pylclari contains the active substance piflufolastat (18F), which contains radioactive fluorine (18F). It is 
given so that doctors can perform a special type of scan called a positron emission tomography (PET) 
scan to detect specific types of cancer cells with a protein called prostate-specific membrane antigen 
(PSMA). This medicine is used in patients: 
-
with prostate cancer who are at high risk of the disease spreading to other parts of the body and 
who is suitable for treatment which can cure the cancer 
have received previous treatment for prostate cancer and in whom the cancer is suspected to have 
returned based on the results from other tests (e.g., prostate specific antigen, PSA). 
-
Pylclari PET scan can can help your doctor find the locations of the disease. 
You should discuss the results of the test with the doctor that requested the scan. 
The use of Pylclari does involve exposure to small amounts of radioactivity. Your doctor and the nuclear 
medicine doctor have considered that the clinical benefit that you will obtain from the procedure with 
the radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk due to radiation. 
2.  What you need to know before Pylclari is given to you 
Pylclari must not be used 
If you are allergic to piflufolastat (18F) or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).

Drink plenty of water before the start of the examination in order to urinate as often as possible during 
the first hours after the scan. 
Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not intended for use in children and adolescents. 
Other medicines and Pylclari 
Tell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines, such as hormonotherapy to treat your prostate cancer, since they may interfere with the 
interpretation of the images. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
This medicine is not intended for use in women. 
Driving and using machines 
It is considered unlikely that this medicine will affect your ability to drive or to use machines. 
Pylclari contains alcohol (ethanol) 
This medicine contains up to 900 mg alcohol per administration equivalent to less than 23 mL of beer 
or 11 mL of wine. The small amount of alcohol in this medicine will not have any noticeable effect. 
Pylclari contains sodium 
This medicine contains up to 35 mg of sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each dose. 
This is equivalent to 2 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult. 
3. 
How Pylclari is given 
There are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radiopharmaceutical products. Pylclari will 
only be used in specially controlled areas. This product will only be handled and given to you by 
people who are trained and qualified to use it safely. These persons will take special care for the safe 
use of this medicine and will keep you informed of their actions. 
Recommended dose 
The nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure will decide on the quantity of this medicine to 
be used in your case. It will be the smallest quantity necessary to get the desired information. The 
mean recommended amount is 4 MBq/kg of body weight ; it is about 280 megabecquerel for an adult 
of 70 kg (MBq, the unit used to express radioactivity). 
Administration of Pylclari and conduct of the procedure 
-
-
This medicine will be given as a single injection into a vein in your arm. 
One injection is sufficient to conduct the test that your doctor needs. 
Duration of the procedure 
Your nuclear medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure. 
The scan will usually start between 90 and 120 minutes after Pylclari injection is given. 
After administration of Pylclari you should: 
-
avoid any close contact with young children and pregnant women for the 12 hours following the 
injection

your body. 
The nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any other special precautions after 
receiving this medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor if you have any questions. 
If you have been given more Pylclari than you should 
An overdose is unlikely because you will only receive a single dose of Pylclari precisely controlled by 
the nuclear medicine doctor supervising the procedure. 
However, in case of an overdose, you will receive the appropriate treatment. The nuclear medicine 
doctor in charge of the procedure may provide ways to increase the passing of urine in order to 
facilitate the removal of the medicine from your body. 
Should you have any further question on the use of Pylclari, please ask your nuclear medicine doctor 
who supervises the procedure.

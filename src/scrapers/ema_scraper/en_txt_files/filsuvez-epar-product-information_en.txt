For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Gel 
Colourless to slightly yellowish, opalescent, non-aqueous gel. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of partial thickness wounds associated with dystrophic and junctional epidermolysis bullosa 
(EB) in patients 6 months and older. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The gel should be applied to the wound surface at a thickness of approximately 1 mm and covered by 
a sterile non-adhesive wound dressing or applied to the dressing so that the gel is in direct contact with 
the wound. The gel should not be applied sparingly. It should not be rubbed in. The gel should be 
reapplied at each wound dressing change. The maximum total wound area treated in clinical studies 
was 5,300 cm2 with a median total wound area of 735 cm2. If symptoms persist or worsen after use, or 
if wound complications occur, the patient’s condition should be fully clinically assessed prior to 
continuation of treatment, and regularly re-evaluated thereafter. 
Special populations 
Renal or hepatic impairment 
No studies have been conducted with Filsuvez in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. No dose 
adjustment or special considerations are anticipated for patients with renal or hepatic impairment (see 
section 5.2). 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment is required. 
Paediatric population 
The posology in paediatric patients (6 months and older) is the same as in adults.  
The safety and efficacy of Filsuvez in children aged less than 6 months have not been established. No 
data are available.

Method of administration 
For cutaneous application only.  
Filsuvez should be applied to cleansed wounds. This medicinal product is not for ophthalmic use and 
should not be applied to mucous membranes.  
Each tube is for single use only. The tube should be discarded after use. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to the excipient listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hypersensitivity 
Hypersensitivity has occurred in patients treated with Filsuvez (see section 4.8). If signs and 
symptoms of local or systemic hypersensitivity occur, Filsuvez should be discontinued immediately 
and appropriate therapy should be initiated. 
Wound infection 
The gel is sterile. However, wound infection is an important and serious complication that can occur 
during wound healing. In the case of infection, it is recommended to interrupt treatment. Additional 
standard treatment may be required (see section 4.5). Treatment may be re-initiated once the infection 
has resolved. 
Squamous cell carcinoma and other skin malignancies 
Patients with dystrophic EB (DEB) and junctional EB (JEB) may be at increased risk of development 
of squamous cell carcinoma. While there has been no increased risk of skin malignancies associated 
with Filsuvez to date, a theoretical increased risk of skin malignancies associated with use of Filsuvez 
cannot be ruled out. In the case of diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma or other skin malignancies, 
treatment to the affected area should be discontinued. 
Use in dominant dystrophic EB (DDEB) and junctional EB (JEB) 
The quantity of clinical data from use of Filsuvez in patients with DDEB and JEB is limited (see 
section 5.1). The patient’s condition should be regularly evaluated to assess the benefit of continued 
treatment. 
Birch pollen allergy 
Filsuvez is safe to use for people who are allergic to birch pollen, as these allergens are not present in 
this medicinal product. 
Accidental eye exposure 
In the case of exposure to eyes product should be removed by eye irrigation. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. Since the systemic exposure of the main component 
betulin following cutaneous application is negligible no interaction with systemic treatments is 
expected. Interactions with topical products have not been investigated in clinical trials. Other topical 
products should not be concomitantly used together with Filsuvez but rather sequentially or 
alternatively depending on the clinical need.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of Filsuvez in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct 
or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). No effects during 
pregnancy are anticipated, since systemic exposure to Filsuvez is negligible. Filsuvez can be used 
during pregnancy.  
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether birch bark extract/metabolites are excreted in human milk. No effects on the 
breastfed newborn/infant are anticipated since the systemic exposure of the breastfeeding woman to 
Filsuvez is negligible. Filsuvez can be used during breast-feeding, unless the chest area is subject to 
treatment.  
Fertility 
No adverse effects on fertility were observed in male and female rats administered birch bark extract. 
No effects on human fertility are anticipated, since the systemic exposure is negligible.  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Filsuvez has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most frequently observed adverse reactions were wound complication (in 11.6% of EB patients 
and 2.9% of patients with other partial thickness wounds (PTW)), application site reaction (in 5.8% of 
EB patients), wound infections (in 4.0% of EB patients), pruritus (in 3.1% of EB patients and 1.3% of 
patients with other PTW), pain of skin (in 2.5% of patients with other PTW) and hypersensitivity 
reactions (in 1.3% of EB patients). There were no clinically relevant differences in the reactions 
reported in EB patients compared to patients with other PTW. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
In the following table, adverse reactions are listed by MedDRA system organ class and preferred term. 
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. 
The frequency of adverse reactions is defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to 
< 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not 
known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Hypersensitivity 
Common cases of hypersensitivity-like reactions have been observed during clinical trials in EB 
patients. These reactions include rash, urticaria and eczema which were mild in 1.3% of patients and 
severe in 0.4% of patients. For specific recommendations, see section 4.4. 
Application site reactions 
Mild or moderate application site reactions are common and include application site pain and 
application site pruritis. 
Wound complication 
In studies with EB patients, wound complication comprised different kinds of local complications such 
as increase in wound size, wound re-opening, wound pain and wound haemorrhage.  
In studies in patients with burn wounds or split-thickness skin grafts, wound complications comprised 
different kinds of local complications such as post-procedural complications, wound necrosis, wound 
secretion, impaired healing, or inflammation of wound. 
Paediatric population 
70% (n = 156) of patients randomised in the pivotal study (see section 5.1) were under the age of 18 
with a median age of 12 years. 8% (n = 17) of patients were below 4 years of age and 2 patients were 
under 1 year of age. The adverse reactions observed in the overall population were similar to those 
observed in the paediatric population. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Overdosing with Filsuvez is unlikely. No case of overdose has been reported when a maximum 
amount of 69 g was used on a daily basis for more than 90 days.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Preparations for treatment of wounds and ulcers, other cicatrizants; ATC 
code: D03AX13. 
Mechanism of action and pharmacodynamic effects 
Cell culture assays with human primary keratinocytes and fibroblasts and ex vivo studies with porcine 
skin show that the extract including the main component betulin modulate inflammatory mediators 
and are associated with activation of intracellular pathways known to be involved in keratinocyte 
differentiation and migration, wound healing and closure. 
The precise mechanism of action of Filsuvez in wound healing is not known. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy and safety of Filsuvez in the treatment of partial thickness wounds associated with 
inherited EB were evaluated in a pivotal global Phase 3, randomised, double blind, controlled study in 
adults and children (Study BEB-13; EASE). Patients with DEB and JEB were randomised 1:1 to 
receive Filsuvez (n = 109) or a blinded control gel (consisting of sunflower oil, refined; beeswax, 
yellow and carnauba wax) (n = 114) and instructed to apply the investigational product at a thickness 
of approximately 1 mm to all their wounds at each dressing change (every 1 to 4 days) for 90 days. At 
randomisation, one wound was selected by the investigator as the target wound for the evaluation of 
the primary efficacy endpoint. The target wound was defined as a partial thickness wound of 
10-50 cm2 in surface area and present for 21 days to 9 months prior to screening. The primary 
endpoint was the proportion of patients with first complete closure of the target wound by day 45 of 
the 90-day double blind phase (DBP) of the study. Following completion of the DBP, patients entered 
a 24-month open label phase (OLP) of the study during which all wounds were treated with Filsuvez. 
Of the 223 patients randomised, the median age was 12 years (range: 6 months to 81 years), 70% were 
under 18 years of age and 8% of patients were below 4 years of age. 60% of patients randomised were 
male. Of these 223 patients, 195 had DEB of which 175 patients had recessive DEB (RDEB), 20 had 
dominant DEB (DDEB); in addition, there were 26 patients with JEB. In the DBP the majority of 
patients applied the study treatment to all wounds either daily or every 2 days (between 70% and 
78%). Limited data are available for Black and Asian patients. 
The results, including the primary endpoint, are presented in Table 2.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Systemic exposure to the main component betulin was assessed at baseline and periodically during 
BEB-13 using a dried blood spot bioanalytical method. Betulin venous blood concentrations were 
below quantitation limits (10 ng/mL) in the large majority of subjects. In a minority of subjects, 
measurable venous blood concentrations of betulin were observed, suggesting that there is minimal 
absorption of topically administered betulin. These venous blood concentrations, no greater than 
207 ng/mL, were similar to those observed with ingestion of food sources containing betulin. 
Distribution 
The plasma protein binding of betulin is > 99.9%. 
Metabolism 
The in vitro metabolism of betulin was assessed in a suspension of human hepatocytes, where 99% 
were completely metabolised in five hours. The most abundant metabolite in vitro was formed through 
oxidation, methylation, and sulfation. Three other metabolites were formed by sulfation or 
glucuronidation. Non-CYP enzymatic pathways are expected to play the predominant role in the 
overall hepatic metabolism of betulin (75%), while the CYP mediated pathways (25%) are mainly 
driven by CYP3A4/5 isoenzyme. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Betulin showed a direct inhibition of CYP2C8 (test substrate amodiaquine) and CYP3A (test 
substrates testosterone and midazolam) with IC50 values of 0.60 µM (266 ng/mL), 0.17 µM 
(75 ng/mL) and 0.62 µM (275 ng/mL), respectively in human hepatocytes. In addition, betulin caused 
a very slight induction of CYP3A4 mRNA (2.7-fold). However given the negligible systemic 
exposure, no interaction with systemic treatments is expected. 
Elimination 
No in vivo elimination studes have been performed. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, toxicity to reproduction and development, and phototoxicity.  
After a 4-week topical treatment with Filsuvez gel, several reactions are observed at the site of 
administration in minipigs, including inflammatory effects, lympho-histiocytic inflammatory cell 
infiltration and epithelial hyperplasia. Following a 9-month dermal treatment in minipigs, epidermal 
hyperplasia, orthokeratotic hyperkeratosis, dermal lymphocytic and/or neutrophilic infiltration, and 
pustules in the stratum corneum were observed in some animals. 
In vitro genotoxicity studies were negative. Further studies on genotoxicity or carcinogenicity have not 
been performed.

1.  What Filsuvez is and what it is used for 
Filsuvez gel is a herbal medicinal product which contains dry extract from birch bark. 
It is used to treat wounds in adults and children (age 6 months and older) who have a type of the 
condition “epidermolysis bullosa” (EB) called “dystrophic” (DEB) or “junctional” (JEB). This is a 
condition where the outer layer of the skin separates from the inner layer, making the skin very fragile 
and causing wounds to appear. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Filsuvez 
Do not use Filsuvez 
- 
if you are allergic to birch bark or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Filsuvez. 
If you get an allergic reaction, stop using Filsuvez immediately and see your doctor or nurse. Signs 
of an allergic reaction include: 
• 
itching, swelling and redness of the skin that is more severe on the area where the medicine has 
been applied. 
yellow or greenish fluid (pus) draining from the wound,  
red, warm, swollen, or increasingly painful skin around the wound. 
Wound infection is a serious complication that can occur during the healing process. Possible signs of 
a wound infection are: 
• 
• 
If you have a wound infection, you may need to stop using Filsuvez and another treatment may be 
required. Your doctor or nurse will let you know if treatment with Filsuvez can be restarted once the 
infection has gone. 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
People with EB are more likely to develop a type of skin cancer called “squamous cell carcinoma” 
(SCC). If you are diagnosed with a skin cancer while using Filsuvez you should talk with your doctor 
or nurse and stop using Filsuvez on that part of your skin. 
Filsuvez does not contain birch pollen, so it may be used by people with a birch pollen allergy. 
Avoid getting Filsuvez in your eyes. If this does happen, rinse your eyes well with clean water. 
Contact your doctor or nurse if any discomfort continues. 
Children 
Do not give this medicine to children below 6 months. 
Other medicines and Filsuvez 
Tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse if you are using, have recently used or might use any other 
medicines. 
There is no information on how Filsuvez could react with other medicines applied to the skin, taken by 
mouth or injected. Do not apply other products to the wound area at the same time as applying 
Filsuvez. If you need to use more than one product talk to your doctor or nurse.

this medicine into the body is extremely low, the risk to the unborn baby is negligible. Filsuvez can be

clean or gloved hand (Step 2). 
o  Cover the wound with the dressing (Step 3).

Step 2 - Spread 
Step 3 - Cover 
• 
• 
• 
Re-apply the gel each time your dressing is changed, until the wound is healed. 
Filsuvez is not for internal use. Avoid contact with the eyes, mouth or nostrils. If accidental 
contact does occur, immediately wash with clean water. 
This tube of sterile gel is for a single application. Once opened, the gel should be used 
immediately and the tube thrown away, even if there is some gel left. A new tube should be 
used at each dressing change. 
Duration of use 
Your doctor, pharmacist or nurse will tell you for how long you should use the gel. If symptoms 
continue or worsen after use, or if wound complications occur, speak to your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse. 
If you use more Filsuvez than you should 
Filsuvez is applied to the skin and the absorption into the body is extremely low. This makes overdose 
very unlikely, even if applied to large skin areas and for a long period of time. 
If you forget to use Filsuvez 
Apply Filsuvez at the next planned change of wound dressing, continuing with your normal routine. 
If you stop using Filsuvez 
Filsuvez should be used as advised by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. Do not stop using it without

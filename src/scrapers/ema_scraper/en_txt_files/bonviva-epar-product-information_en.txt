3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Film-coated tablet 
White to off white film-coated tablets, of oblong shape marked “BNVA” on one side, and “150” on 
the other side.  
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture (see section 5.1). 
A reduction in the risk of vertebral fractures has been demonstrated, efficacy on femoral neck fractures 
has not been established. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The recommended dose is one 150 mg film-coated tablet once a month. The tablet should preferably 
be taken on the same date each month. 
Bonviva should be taken after an overnight fast (at least 6 hours) and 1 hour before the first food or 
drink (other than water) of the day (see section 4.5) or any other oral medicinal products or 
supplementation (including calcium). 
In case a dose is missed, patients should be instructed to take one Bonviva 150 mg tablet the morning 
after the tablet is remembered, unless the time to the next scheduled dose is within 7 days.  
Patients should then return to taking their dose once a month on their originally scheduled date. 
If the next scheduled dose is within 7 days, patients should wait until their next dose and then continue 
taking one tablet once a month as originally scheduled.  
Patients should not take two tablets within the same week. 
Patients should receive supplemental calcium and / or vitamin D if dietary intake is inadequate (see 
section 4.4 and section 4.5). 
The optimal duration of bisphosphonate treatment for osteoporosis has not been established. The need 
for continued treatment should be re-evaluated periodically based on the benefits and potential risks of 
Bonviva on an individual patient basis, particularly after 5 or more years of use.

Special populations 
Patients with renal impairment 
Bonviva is not recommended for patients with a creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min due to limited 
clinical experience (see section 4.4 and section 5.2). 
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment where creatinine 
clearance is equal or greater than 30 ml/min. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). 
Elderly population (>65 years) 
No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Bonviva in children below 18 years, and Bonviva was not studied in this 
population. (see section 5.1 and section 5.2). 
Method of administration 
For oral use. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water (180 to 240 ml) while the patient is 
sitting or standing in an upright position. Water with a high concentration of calcium should not 
be used. If there is a concern regarding potentially high levels of calcium in the tap water (hard 
water), it is advised to use bottled water with a low mineral content. 
Patients should not lie down for 1 hour after taking Bonviva. 
Water is the only drink that should be taken with Bonviva.  
Patients should not chew or suck the tablet, because of a potential for oropharyngeal ulceration 
4.3  Contraindications 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Hypersensitivity to ibandronic acid or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 
Hypocalcaemia  
Abnormalities of the oesophagus which delay oesophageal emptying such as stricture or 
achalasia 
Inability to stand or sit upright for at least 60 minutes     
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hypocalcaemia 
Existing hypocalcaemia must be corrected before starting Bonviva therapy. Other disturbances of bone 
and mineral metabolism should also be effectively treated. Adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D 
is important in all patients. 
Gastrointestinal irritation 
Orally administered bisphosphonates may cause local irritation of the upper gastrointestinal mucosa. 
Because of these possible irritant effects and a potential for worsening of the underlying disease, 
caution should be used when Bonviva is given to patients with active upper gastrointestinal problems 
(e.g. known Barrett’s oesophagus, dysphagia, other oesophageal diseases, gastritis, duodenitis or 
ulcers). 
Adverse reactions such as oesophagitis, oesophageal ulcers and oesophageal erosions, in some cases 
severe and requiring hospitalisation, rarely with bleeding or followed by oesophageal stricture or 
perforation, have been reported in patients receiving treatment with oral bisphosphonates. The risk of 
severe oesophageal adverse experiences appears to be greater in patients who do not comply with the 
dosing instruction and/or who continue to take oral bisphosphonates after developing symptoms 
suggestive of oesophageal irritation. Patients should pay particular attention to and be able to comply 
with the dosing instructions (see section 4.2). 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Physicians should be alert to any signs or symptoms signaling a possible oesophageal reaction and 
patients should be instructed to discontinue Bonviva and seek medical attention if they develop 
dysphagia, odynophagia, retrosternal pain or new or worsening heartburn. 
While no increased risk was observed in controlled clinical trials there have been post-marketing 
reports of gastric and duodenal ulcers with oral bisphosphonate use, some severe and with 
complications. 
Since Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory medicinal products and bisphosphonates are both associated 
with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be taken during concomitant administration. 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported very rarely in the post marketing setting in patients 
receiving Bonviva for osteoporosis (see section 4.8).  
The start of treatment or of a new course of treatment should be delayed in patients with unhealed 
open soft tissue lesions in the mouth. 
A dental examination with preventive dentistry and an individual benefit-risk assessment is 
recommended prior to treatment with Bonviva in patients with concomitant risk factors. 
The following risk factors should be considered when evaluating a patient’s risk of developing ONJ:  
Potency of the medicinal product that inhibit bone resorption (higher risk for highly potent 
- 
compounds), route of administration (higher risk for parenteral administration) and cumulative 
dose of bone resorption therapy 
Cancer, co-morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection), smoking 
Concomitant therapies: corticosteroids, chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, radiotherapy to 
head and neck 
Poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, poorly fitting dentures, history of dental disease, invasive 
dental procedures e.g. tooth extractions 
- 
- 
- 
All patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene, undergo routine dental check-ups, 
and immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility, pain or swelling, or non-healing of 
sores or discharge during treatment with Bonviva. While on treatment, invasive dental procedures 
should be performed only after careful consideration and be avoided in close proximity to Bonviva 
administration. 
The management plan of the patients who develop ONJ should be set up in close collaboration 
between the treating physician and a dentist or oral surgeon with expertise in ONJ. Temporary 
interruption of Bonviva treatment should be considered until the condition resolves and contributing 
risk factors are mitigated where possible. 
Osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal 
Osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal has been reported with bisphosphonates, mainly in 
association with long-term therapy. Possible risk factors for osteonecrosis of the external auditory 
canal include steroid use and chemotherapy and/or local risk factors such as infection or trauma. The 
possibility of osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal should be considered in patients receiving 
bisphosphonates who present with ear symptoms including chronic ear infections. 
Atypical fractures of the femur 
Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate 
therapy, primarily in patients receiving long-term treatment for osteoporosis. These transverse or short 
oblique fractures can occur anywhere along the femur from just below the lesser trochanter to just 
above the supracondylar flare. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma and some patients 
experience thigh or groin pain, often associated with imaging features of stress fractures, weeks to 
months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the 
contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. Discontinuation of 
bisphosphonate therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered 
pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. 
During bisphosphonate treatment patients should be advised to report any thigh, hip or groin pain and 
any patient presenting with such symptoms should be evaluated for an incomplete femur fracture. 
Renal impairment 
Due to limited clinical experience, Bonviva is not recommended for patients with a creatinine 
clearance below 30 ml/min (see section 5.2). 
Galactose intolerance 
This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this 
medicinal product. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Medicinal product-Food Interaction  
Oral bioavailability of ibandronic acid is generally reduced in the presence of food. In particular, 
products containing calcium, including milk, and other multivalent cations (such as aluminium, 
magnesium, iron), are likely to interfere with absorption of Bonviva, which is consistent with findings 
in animal studies. Therefore, patients should fast overnight (at least 6 hours) before taking Bonviva 
and continue fasting for 1 hour following intake of Bonviva (see section 4.2). 
Interactions with other medicinal products 
Metabolic interactions are not considered likely, since ibandronic acid does not inhibit the major 
human hepatic P450 isoenzymes and has been shown not to induce the hepatic cytochrome P450 
system in rats (see section 5.2). Ibandronic acid is eliminated by renal excretion only and does not 
undergo any biotransformation.  
Calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicinal products containing multivalent cations 
Calcium supplements, antacids and some oral medicinal products containing multivalent cations (such 
as aluminium, magnesium, iron) are likely to interfere with the absorption of Bonviva. Therefore, 
patients should not take other oral medicinal products for at least 6 hours before taking Bonviva and 
for 1 hour following intake of Bonviva.  
Acetylsalicylic acid and NSAIDs   
Since Acetylsalicylic acid, Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory medicinal products (NSAIDs) and 
bisphosphonates are associated with gastrointestinal irritation, caution should be taken during 
concomitant administration (see section 4.4). 
H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors  
Of over 1500 patients enrolled in study BM 16549 comparing monthly with daily dosing regimens of 
ibandronic acid, 14 % and 18 % of patients used histamine (H2) blockers or proton pump inhibitors 
after one and two years, respectively. Among these patients, the incidence of upper gastrointestinal 
events in the patients treated with Bonviva 150 mg once monthly was similar to that in patients treated 
with ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily. 
In healthy male volunteers and postmenopausal women, intravenous administration of ranitidine 
caused an increase in ibandronic acid bioavailability of about 20 %, probably as a result of reduced 
gastric acidity. However, since this increase is within the normal variability of the bioavailability of 
ibandronic acid, no dose adjustment is considered necessary when Bonviva is administered with H2-
antagonists or other active substances which increase gastric pH.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Bonviva is only for use in postmenopausal women and must not be taken by women of childbearing 
potential. 
There are no adequate data from the use of ibandronic acid in pregnant women. Studies in rats have 
shown some reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. 
Bonviva should not be used during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether ibandronic acid is excreted in human milk. Studies in lactating rats have 
demonstrated the presence of low levels of ibandronic acid in the milk following intravenous 
administration. 
Bonviva should not be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
There are no data on the effects of ibandronic acid from humans. In reproductive studies in rats by the 
oral route, ibandronic acid decreased fertility. In studies in rats using the intravenous route, ibandronic 
acid decreased fertility at high daily doses (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
On the basis of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile and reported adverse reactions, it is 
expected that Bonviva has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most serious reported adverse reactions are anaphylactic reaction/shock, atypical fractures of the 
femur, osteonecrosis of the jaw, gastrointestinal irritation, ocular inflammation, (see paragraph 
“Description of selected adverse reactions” and section 4.4). 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions are arthralgia and influenza-like symptoms. These 
symptoms are typically in association with the first dose, generally of short duration, mild or moderate 
in intensity, and usually resolve during continuing treatment without requiring remedial measures (see 
paragraph “Influenza like illness”). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
In table 1 a complete list  of known adverse reactions is presented. The safety of oral treatment with 
ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily was evaluated in 1251 patients treated in 4 placebo-controlled clinical 
studies, with the large majority of patients coming from the pivotal three year fracture study 
(MF4411).  
In a two-year study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (BM 16549) the overall safety of 
Bonviva 150 mg once monthly and ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily was similar. The overall proportion 
of patients who experienced an adverse reaction, was 22.7 % and 25.0 % for Bonviva 150 mg once 
monthly after one and two years, respectively. Most cases did not lead to cessation of therapy. 
Adverse reactions are listed according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency category. 
Frequency categories are defined using the following convention: very common (>1/10),  common 
(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000),very rare 
(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency 
grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Gastrointestinal adverse reactions 
Patients with a previous history of gastrointestinal disease including patients with peptic ulcer without 
recent bleeding or hospitalisation, and patients with dyspepsia or reflux controlled by medication were 
included in the once monthly treatment study. For these patients, there was no difference in the 
incidence of upper gastrointestinal adverse events with the 150 mg once monthly regimen compared to 
the 2.5 mg daily regimen. 
Influenza-like illness 
Influenza-like illness includes events reported as acute phase reaction or symptoms including myalgia, 
arthralgia, fever, chills, fatigue, nausea, loss of appetite, or bone pain.

Osteonecrosis of jaw 
Cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw have been reported, predominantly in cancer patients treated with 
medicinal products that inhibit bone resorption, such as ibandronic acid (see section 4.4.) Cases of 
ONJ have been reported in the post marketing setting for ibandronic acid. 
Ocular inflammation 
Ocular inflammation events such as uveitis, episcleritis and scleritis have been reported with 
ibandronic acid. In some cases, these events did not resolve until the ibandronic acid was discontinued. 
Anaphylactic reaction/shock 
Cases of anaphylactic reaction/shock, including fatal events, have been reported in patients treated 
with intravenous ibandronic acid. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdose with Bonviva. 
However, based on a knowledge of this class of compounds, oral overdose may result in upper 
gastrointestinal adverse reactions (such as upset stomach, dyspepsia, oesophagitis, gastritis, or ulcer) 
or hypocalcaemia. Milk or antacids should be given to bind Bonviva, and any adverse reactions treated 
symptomatically. Owing to the risk of oesophageal irritation, vomiting should not be induced and the 
patient should remain fully upright.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Medicinal products for treatment of bone diseases, bisphosphonates, ATC 
code: M05-BA06 
Mechanism of action 
Ibandronic acid is a highly potent bisphosphonate belonging to the nitrogen-containing group of 
bisphosphonates, which act selectively on bone tissue and specifically inhibit osteoclast activity 
without directly affecting bone formation. It does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment. Ibandronic 
acid leads to progressive net gains in bone mass and a decreased incidence of fractures through the 
reduction of elevated bone turnover towards premenopausal levels in postmenopausal women. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
The pharmacodynamic action of ibandronic acid is inhibition of bone resorption. In vivo, ibandronic 
acid prevents experimentally induced bone destruction caused by cessation of gonadal function, 
retinoids, tumours or tumour extracts. In young (fast growing) rats, the endogenous bone resorption is 
also inhibited, leading to increased normal bone mass compared with untreated animals. 
Animal models confirm that ibandronic acid is a highly potent inhibitor of osteoclastic activity. In 
growing rats, there was no evidence of impaired mineralization even at doses greater than 5,000 times 
the dose required for osteoporosis treatment. 
Both daily and intermittent (with prolonged dose-free intervals) long-term administration in rats, dogs 
and monkeys was associated with formation of new bone of normal quality and maintained or 
increased mechanical strength even at doses in the toxic range. In humans, the efficacy of both daily 
and intermittent administration with a dose-free interval of 9-10 weeks of ibandronic acid was 
confirmed in a clinical trial (MF 4411), in which ibandronic acid demonstrated anti-fracture efficacy. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In animal models ibandronic acid produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent 
inhibition of bone resorption, including suppression of urinary biochemical markers of bone collagen 
degradation (such as deoxypyridinoline, and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTX)). 
In a Phase 1 bioequivalence study conducted in 72 postmenopausal women receiving 150 mg orally 
every 28 days for a total of four doses, inhibition in serum CTX following the first dose was seen as 
early as 24 hours post-dose (median inhibition 28 %), with median maximal inhibition (69 %) seen 
6 days later. Following the third and fourth dose, the median maximum inhibition 6 days post dose 
was 74 % with reduction to a median inhibition of 56 % seen 28 days following the fourth dose. With 
no further dosing, there is a loss of suppression of biochemical markers of bone resorption. 
Clinical efficacy 
Independent risk factors, for example, low BMD, age, the existence of previous fractures, a family 
history of fractures, high bone turnover and low body mass index should be considered in order to 
identify women at increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. 
Bonviva 150 mg once monthly 
Bone mineral density (BMD) 
Bonviva 150 mg once monthly was shown to be at least as effective as ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily at 
increasing BMD in a two year, double-blind, multicentre study (BM 16549) of postmenopausal 
women with osteoporosis (lumbar spine BMD T score below -2.5 SD at baseline). This was 
demonstrated in both the primary analysis at one year and in the confirmatory analysis at two years 
endpoint (Table 2).

Furthermore, Bonviva 150 mg once monthly was proven superior to ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily for 
increases in lumbar spine BMD in a prospectively planned analysis at one year, p=0.002, and at two 
years, p<0.001. 
At one year (primary analysis), 91.3 % (p=0.005) of patients receiving Bonviva 150 mg once monthly 
had a lumbar spine BMD increase above or equal to baseline (BMD responders), compared with 
84.0 % of patients receiving ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily. At two years, 93.5 % (p=0.004) and 86.4 % 
of patients receiving Bonviva 150 mg once monthly or ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily, respectively, 
were responders.  
For total hip BMD, 90.0 % (p<0.001) of patients receiving Bonviva 150 mg once monthly and 76.7 % 
of patients receiving ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily had total hip BMD increases above or equal to 
baseline at one year. At two years  93.4 % (p<0.001) of patients receiving Bonviva 150 mg once 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
monthly and 78.4 %, of patients receiving ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily had total hip BMD increases 
above or equal to baseline. 
When a more stringent criterion is considered, which combines both lumbar spine and total hip BMD, 
83.9 % (p<0.001) and 65.7 % of patients receiving Bonviva 150 mg once monthly or ibandronic acid 
2.5 mg daily, respectively, were responders at one year. At two years, 87.1 % (p<0.001) and 70.5 %,of 
patients met this criterion in the 150 mg monthly and 2.5 mg daily arms respectively. 
Biochemical markers of bone turn-over 
Clinically meaningful reductions in serum CTX levels were observed at all time points measured, i.e. 
months 3, 6, 12 and 24. After one year (primary analysis) the median relative change from baseline 
was -76 % for Bonviva 150 mg once monthly and -67 % for ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily. At two 
years the median relative change was -68 % and -62 %, in the 150 mg monthly and 2.5 mg daily arms 
respectively.  
At one year, 83.5 % (p= 0.006) of patients receiving Bonviva 150 mg once monthly and 73.9 % of 
patients receiving ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily were identified as responders (defined as a decrease 
≥50 % from baseline). At two years 78.7 % (p=0.002) and 65.6 % of patients were identified as 
responders in the 150 mg monthly and 2.5 mg daily arms respectively. 
Based on the results of study BM 16549, Bonviva 150 mg once monthly is expected to be at least as 
effective in preventing fractures as ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily. 
Ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily 
In the initial three-year, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fracture study (MF 4411), a 
statistically significant and medically relevant decrease in the incidence of new radiographic 
morphometric and clinical vertebral fractures was demonstrated (table 3). In this study, ibandronic 
acid was evaluated at oral doses of 2.5 mg daily and 20 mg intermittently as an exploratory regimen. 
Ibandronic acid was taken 60 minutes before the first food or drink of the day (post-dose fasting 
period). The study enrolled women aged 55 to 80 years, who were at least 5 years postmenopausal, 
who had a BMD at lumbar spine of 2 to 5 SD below the premenopausal mean (T-score) in at least one 
vertebra [L1-L4], and who had one to four prevalent vertebral fractures. All patients received 500 mg 
calcium and 400 IU vitamin D daily. Efficacy was evaluated in 2,928 patients. ibandronic acid 2.5 mg 
administered daily, showed a statistically significant and medically relevant reduction in the incidence 
of new vertebral fractures. This regimen reduced the occurrence of new radiographic vertebral 
fractures by 62 % (p=0.0001) over the three year duration of the study. A relative risk reduction of 
61 % was observed after 2 years (p=0.0006). No statistically significant difference was attained after 1 
year of treatment (p=0.056). The anti-fracture effect was consistent over the duration of the study. 
There was no indication of a waning of the effect over time.  
The incidence of clinical vertebral fractures was also significantly reduced by 49 % (p=0.011). The 
strong effect on vertebral fractures was furthermore reflected by a statistically significant reduction of 
height loss compared to placebo (p<0.0001).

The treatment effect of ibandronic acid was further assessed in an analysis of the subpopulation of 
patients who at baseline had a lumbar spine BMD T-score below –2.5. The vertebral fracture risk 
reduction was very consistent with that seen in the overall population.

In the overall patient population of the study MF4411, no reduction was observed for non-vertebral 
fractures, however daily ibandronic acid appeared to be effective in a high-risk subpopulation (femoral 
neck BMD T-score < -3.0), where a non-vertebral fracture risk reduction of 69% was observed. 
Daily treatment with 2.5 mg resulted in progressive increases in BMD at vertebral and nonvertebral 
sites of the skeleton. 
Three-year lumbar spine BMD increase compared to placebo was 5.3 % and 6.5 % compared to 
baseline. Increases at the hip compared to baseline were 2.8 % at the femoral neck, 3.4 % at the total 
hip, and 5.5 % at the trochanter. 
Biochemical markers of bone turnover (such as urinary CTX and serum Osteocalcin) showed the 
expected pattern of suppression to premenopausal levels and reached maximum suppression within a 
period of 3-6 months. 
A clinically meaningful reduction of 50 % of biochemical markers of bone resorption was observed as 
early as one month after start of treatment with ibandronic acid 2.5 mg. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Following treatment discontinuation, there is a reversion to the pathological pre-treatment rates of 
elevated bone resorption associated with postmenopausal osteoporosis. 
The histological analysis of bone biopsies after two and three years of treatment of postmenopausal 
women showed bone of normal quality and no indication of a mineralization defect. 
Paediatric population (see section 4.2 and section 5.2) 
Bonviva was not studied in the paediatric population, therefore no efficacy or safety data are available 
for this patient population.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The primary pharmacological effects of ibandronic acid on bone are not directly related to actual 
plasma concentrations, as demonstrated by various studies in animals and humans.  
Absorption  
The absorption of ibandronic acid in the upper gastrointestinal tract is rapid after oral administration 
and plasma concentrations increase in a dose-proportional manner up to 50 mg oral intake, with 
greater than dose-proportional increases seen above this dose. Maximum observed plasma 
concentrations were reached within 0.5 to 2 hours (median 1 hour) in the fasted state and absolute 
bioavailability was about 0.6 %. The extent of absorption is impaired when taken together with food or 
beverages (other than water). Bioavailability is reduced by about 90 % when ibandronic acid is 
administered with a standard breakfast in comparison with bioavailability seen in fasted subjects. 
There is no meaningful reduction in bioavailability provided ibandronic acid is taken 60 minutes 
before the first food of the day. Both bioavailability and BMD gains are reduced when food or 
beverage is taken less than 60 minutes after ibandronic acid is ingested. 
Distribution 
After initial systemic exposure, ibandronic acid rapidly binds to bone or is excreted into urine. In 
humans, the apparent terminal volume of distribution is at least 90 l and the amount of dose reaching 
the bone is estimated to be 40-50 % of the circulating dose. Protein binding in human plasma is 
approximately 85 % - 87 % (determined in vitro at therapeutic concentrations), and thus there is a low 
potential for interaction with other medicinal products due to displacement. 
Biotransformation 
There is no evidence that ibandronic acid is metabolised in animals or humans. 
Elimination 
The absorbed fraction of ibandronic acid is removed from the circulation via bone absorption 
(estimated to be 40-50 % in postmenopausal women) and the remainder is eliminated unchanged by 
the kidney. The unabsorbed fraction of ibandronic acid is eliminated unchanged in the faeces. 
The range of observed apparent half-lives is broad, the apparent terminal half-life is generally in the 
range of 10-72 hours. As the values calculated are largely a function of the duration of study, the dose 
used, and assay sensitivity, the true terminal half-life is likely to be substantially longer, in common 
with other bisphosphonates. Early plasma levels fall quickly reaching 10 % of peak values within 3 
and 8 hours after intravenous or oral administration respectively.  
Total clearance of ibandronic acid is low with average values in the range 84-160 ml/min. Renal 
clearance (about 60 mL/min in healthy postmenopausal females) accounts for 50-60 % of total 
clearance and is related to creatinine clearance. The difference between the apparent total and renal 
clearances is considered to reflect the uptake by bone. 
The secretory pathway appears not to include known acidic or basic transport systems involved in the 
excretion of other active substances. In addition, ibandronic acid does not inhibit the major human 
hepatic P450 isoenzymes and does not induce the hepatic cytochrome P450 system in rats. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacokinetics in special clinical situations 
Gender 
Bioavailability and pharmacokinetics of ibandronic acid are similar in men and women. 
Race 
There is no evidence for any clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences between Asians and 
Caucasians in ibandronic acid disposition. There are few data available on patients of African origin. 
Patients with renal impairment  
Renal clearance of ibandronic acid in patients with various degrees of renal impairment is linearly 
related to creatinine clearance. 
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CLcr equal or 
greater than 30 ml/min), as shown in study BM 16549 where the majority of patients had mild to 
moderate renal impairment. 
Subjects with severe renal failure (CLcr less than 30 ml/min) receiving daily oral administration of 
10 mg ibandronic acid for 21 days, had 2-3 fold higher plasma concentrations than subjects with 
normal renal function and total clearance of ibandronic acid was 44 ml/min. After intravenous 
administration of 0.5 mg, total, renal, and non-renal clearances decreased by 67 %, 77 % and 50 %, 
respectively, in subjects with severe renal failure but there was no reduction in tolerability associated 
with the increase in exposure. Due to the limited clinical experience, Bonviva is not recommended in 
patients with severe renal impairment (see section 4.2 and section 4.4). The pharmacokinetics of 
ibandronic acid was not assessed in patients with end-stage renal disease managed by other than 
hemodialysis. The pharmacokinetics of ibandronic acid in these patients is unknown, and ibandronic 
acid should not be used under these circumstances. 
Patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.2) 
There are no pharmacokinetic data for ibandronic acid in patients who have hepatic impairment. The 
liver has no significant role in the clearance of ibandronic acid which is not metabolised but is cleared 
by renal excretion and by uptake into bone. Therefore dose adjustment is not necessary in patients 
with hepatic impairment. 
Elderly population (see section 4.2) 
In a multivariate analysis, age was not found to be an independent factor of any of the 
pharmacokinetic parameters studied. As renal function decreases with age this is the only factor to 
take into consideration (see renal impairment section). 
Paediatric population (see section 4.2 and section 5.1) 
There are no data on the use of Bonviva in these age groups. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Toxic effects, e.g signs of renal damage, were observed in dogs only at exposures considered 
sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure indicating little relevance to clinical use.  
Mutagenicity/Carcinogenicity: 
No indication of carcinogenic potential was observed. Tests for genotoxicity revealed no evidence of 
genetic activity for ibandronic acid. 
Reproductive toxicity: 
There was no evidence for a direct foetal toxic or teratogenic effect of ibandronic acid in orally treated 
rats and rabbits and there were no adverse effects on the development in F1 offspring in rats at an 
extrapolated exposure of at least 35 times above human exposure. In reproductive studies in rats by the 
oral route effects on fertility consisted of increased preimplantation losses at dose levels of 1 
mg/kg/day and higher. In reproductive studies in rats by the intravenous route, ibandronic acid 
decreased sperm counts at doses of 0.3 and 1 mg/kg/day and decreased fertility in males at 1 
mg/kg/day and in females at 1.2 mg/kg/day. Adverse effects of ibandronic acid in reproductive 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
toxicity studies in the rat were those observed with bisphosphonates as a class. They include a 
decreased number of implantation sites, interference with natural delivery (dystocia), and an increase 
in visceral variations (renal pelvis ureter syndrome).

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at increased risk of fracture (see section 5.1). 
A reduction in the risk of vertebral fractures has been demonstrated, efficacy on femoral neck fractures 
has not been established. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Patients treated with Bonviva should be given the package leaflet and the patient reminder card. 
Posology 
The recommended dose of ibandronic acid is 3 mg, administered as an intravenous injection over 15 -
 30 seconds, every three months. 
Patients must receive supplemental calcium and vitamin D (see section 4.4 and section 4.5), 
If a dose is missed, the injection should be administered as soon as convenient. Thereafter, injections 
should be scheduled every 3 months from the date of the last injection. 
The optimal duration of bisphosphonate treatment for osteoporosis has not been established. The need 
for continued treatment should be re-evaluated periodically based on the benefits and potential risks of 
Bonviva on an individual patient basis, particularly after 5 or more years of use. 
Special populations 
Patients with renal impairment 
Bonviva injection is not recommended for use in patients who have a serum creatinine above 
200 μmol/l (2.3 mg/dl) or who have a creatinine clearance (measured or estimated) below 30 ml/min, 
because of limited clinical data available from studies including such patients (see section 4.4 and 
section 5.2). 
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment where serum 
creatinine is equal or below 200 μmol/l (2.3 mg/dl) or where creatinine clearance (measured or 
estimated) is equal or greater than 30 ml/min. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elderly population (>65 years) 
No dose adjustment is required (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
There is no relevant use of Bonviva in children below 18 years, and Bonviva was not studied in this 
population  (see section 5.1 and 5.2).  
Method of administration 
For intravenous use over 15 - 30 seconds, every three months. 
Strict adherence to the intravenous administration route is required (see section 4.4). 
4.3  Contraindications 
- 
- 
Hypersensitivity to ibandronic acid or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 
Hypocalcaemia 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Administration failures 
Care must be taken not to administer Bonviva injection via intra-arterial or paravenous administration 
as this could lead to tissue damage. 
Hypocalcaemia 
Bonviva, like other bisphosphonates administered intravenously, may cause a transient decrease in 
serum calcium values. 
Existing hypocalcaemia must be corrected before starting Bonviva injection therapy. Other 
disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism should also be effectively treated before starting 
Bonviva injection therapy.  
All patients must receive adequate supplemental calcium and vitamin D. 
Anaphylactic reaction/shock 
Cases of anaphylactic reaction/shock, including fatal events, have been reported in patients treated 
with intravenous ibandronic acid. 
Appropriate medical support and monitoring measures should be readily available when Bonviva 
intravenous injection is administered. If anaphylactic or other severe hypersensitivity/allergic reactions 
occur, immediately discontinue the injection and initiate appropriate treatment. 
Renal impairment 
Patients with concomitant diseases, or who use medicinal products which have potential for 
undesirable effects on the kidney, should be reviewed regularly in line with good medical practice 
during treatment.  
Due to limited clinical experience, Bonviva injection is not recommended for patients with a serum 
creatinine above 200 μmol/l (2.3 mg/dl) or with a creatinine clearance below 30 ml/min (see section 
4.2 and section 5.2).  
Patients with cardiac impairment 
Overhydration should be avoided in patients at risk of cardiac failure. 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) has been reported very rarely in the post marketing setting in patients 
receiving Bonviva for osteoporosis (see section 4.8).  
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The start of treatment or of a new course of treatment should be delayed in patients with unhealed 
open soft tissue lesions in the mouth. 
A dental examination with preventive dentistry and an individual benefit-risk assessment is 
recommended prior to treatment with Bonviva in patients with concomitant risk factors. 
The following risk factors should be considered when evaluating a patient’s risk of developing ONJ:  
Potency of the medicinal product that inhibit bone resorption (higher risk for highly potent 
- 
compounds), route of administration (higher risk for parenteral administration) and cumulative 
dose of bone resorption therapy 
Cancer, co-morbid conditions (e.g. anaemia, coagulopathies, infection), smoking 
Concomitant therapies: corticosteroids, chemotherapy, angiogenesis inhibitors, radiotherapy to 
head and neck 
Poor oral hygiene, periodontal disease, poorly fitting dentures, history of dental disease, 
invasive dental procedures e.g. tooth extractions 
- 
- 
- 
All patients should be encouraged to maintain good oral hygiene, undergo routine dental check-ups, 
and immediately report any oral symptoms such as dental mobility, pain or swelling, or non-healing of 
sores or discharge during treatment with Bonviva. While on treatment, invasive dental procedures 
should be performed only after careful consideration and be avoided in close proximity to Bonviva 
administration. 
The management plan of the patients who develop ONJ should be set up in close collaboration 
between the treating physician and a dentist or oral surgeon with expertise in ONJ. Temporary 
interruption of Bonviva treatment should be considered until the condition resolves and contributing 
risk factors are mitigated where possible. 
Osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal 
Osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal has been reported with bisphosphonates, mainly in 
association with long-term therapy. Possible risk factors for osteonecrosis of the external auditory 
canal include steroid use and chemotherapy and/or local risk factors such as infection or trauma. The 
possibility of osteonecrosis of the external auditory canal should be considered in patients receiving 
bisphosphonates who present with ear symptoms including chronic ear infections. 
Atypical fractures of the femur 
Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported with bisphosphonate 
therapy, primarily in patients receiving long-term treatment for osteoporosis. These transverse or short 
oblique fractures can occur anywhere along the femur from just below the lesser trochanter to just 
above the supracondylar flare. These fractures occur after minimal or no trauma and some patients 
experience thigh or groin pain, often associated with imaging features of stress fractures, weeks to 
months before presenting with a completed femoral fracture. Fractures are often bilateral; therefore the 
contralateral femur should be examined in bisphosphonate-treated patients who have sustained a 
femoral shaft fracture. Poor healing of these fractures has also been reported. Discontinuation of 
bisphosphonate therapy in patients suspected to have an atypical femur fracture should be considered 
pending evaluation of the patient, based on an individual benefit risk assessment. 
During bisphosphonate treatment patients should be advised to report any thigh, hip or groin pain and 
any patient presenting with such symptoms should be evaluated for an incomplete femur fracture. 
Bonviva is essentially sodium free. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Metabolic interactions are not considered likely, since ibandronic acid does not inhibit the major 
human hepatic P450 isoenzymes and has been shown not to induce the hepatic cytochrome P450 
system in rats (see section 5.2). Ibandronic acid is eliminated by renal excretion only and does not 
undergo any biotransformation.  
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Bonviva is only for use in postmenopausal women and must not be taken by women of child bearing 
potential. 
There are no adequate data from the use of ibandronic acid in pregnant women. Studies in rats have 
shown some reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. 
Bonviva should not be used during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether ibandronic acid is excreted in human milk. Studies in lactating rats have 
demonstrated the presence of low levels of ibandronic acid in the milk following intravenous 
administration. Bonviva should not be used during  breastfeeding. 
Fertility 
There are no data on the effects of ibandronic acid from humans. In reproductive studies in rats by the 
oral route, ibandronic acid decreased fertility. In studies in rats using the intravenous route, ibandronic 
acid decreased fertility at high daily doses (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
On the basis of the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile and reported adverse reactions, it is 
expected that Bonviva has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most serious reported adverse reactions are anaphylactic reaction/shock, atypical fractures of the 
femur, osteonecrosis for the jaw and ocular inflammation (see paragraph “Description of selected 
adverse reactions” and section 4.4). 
The most frequently reported adverse reactions are arthralgia and influenza-like symptoms. These 
symptoms are typically in association with the first dose, generally of short duration, mild or moderate 
in intensity, and usually resolve during continuing treatment without requiring remedial measures 
(please see paragraph “Influenza like illness”). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
In table 1 a complete list of known adverse reactions is presented.  
The safety of oral treatment with ibandronic acid  2.5 mg  daily was evaluated in 1251 patients treated 
in 4 placebo-controlled clinical studies, with the large majority of patients coming from the pivotal 
three-year fracture  study (MF 4411).  
In the pivotal two-year study in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (BM16550), the overall 
safety of intravenous injection of Bonviva 3 mg every 3 months and oral ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily 
were shown to be similar. The overall proportion of patients who experienced an adverse reaction was 
26.0 % and 28.6 % for Bonviva 3 mg injection every 3 months after one year and two years, 
respectively. Most cases of adverse reactions did not lead to cessation of therapy. 
Adverse reactions are listed according to MedDRA system organ class and frequency category. 
Frequency categories are defined using the following convention: very common (>1/10), common 
(≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare 
(<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available data). Within each frequency 
grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Osteonecrosis of the jaw 
Cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw have been reported, predominantly in cancer patients treated with 
medicinal products that inhibit bone resorption, such as ibandronic acid (see section 4.4.) Cases of 
ONJ have been reported in the post marketing setting for ibandronic acid.  
Ocular inflammation 
Ocular inflammation events such as uveitis, episcleritis and scleritis have been reported with 
ibandronic acid. In some cases, these events did not resolve until the ibandronic acid was discontinued.

Anaphylactic reaction/shock 
Cases of anaphylactic reaction/shock, including fatal events, have been reported in patients treated 
with intravenous ibandronic acid. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with Bonviva. 
Based on knowledge of this class of compounds, intravenous overdosage may result in hypocalcaemia, 
hypophosphataemia, and hypomagnesaemia. Clinically relevant reductions in serum levels of calcium, 
phosphorus, and magnesium should be corrected by intravenous administration of calcium gluconate, 
potassium or sodium phosphate, and magnesium sulfate, respectively.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Medicinal products for treatment of bone diseases, bisphosphonates, ATC 
code: M05BA06 
Mechanism of action 
Ibandronic acid is a highly potent bisphosphonate belonging to the nitrogen-containing group of 
bisphosphonates, which act selectively on bone tissue and specifically inhibit osteoclast activity 
without directly affecting bone formation. It does not interfere with osteoclast recruitment. Ibandronic 
acid leads to progressive net gains in bone mass and a decreased incidence of fractures through the 
reduction of elevated bone turnover towards premenopausal levels in postmenopausal women. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
The pharmacodynamic action of ibandronic acid is inhibition of bone resorption. In vivo, ibandronic 
acid prevents bone destruction experimentally induced by cessation of gonadal function, retinoids, 
tumours or tumour extracts. In young (fast growing) rats, the endogenous bone resorption is also 
inhibited, leading to increased normal bone mass compared with untreated animals. 
Animal models confirm that ibandronic acid is a highly potent inhibitor of osteoclastic activity. In 
growing rats, there was no evidence of impaired mineralisation even at doses greater than 5,000 times 
the dose required for osteoporosis treatment. 
Both daily and intermittent (with prolonged dose-free intervals) long-term administration in rats, dogs 
and monkeys was associated with formation of new bone of normal quality and maintained or 
increased mechanical strength even at doses in the toxic range. In humans, the efficacy of both daily 
and intermittent administration with a dose-free interval of 9 - 10 weeks of ibandronic acid was 
confirmed in a clinical trial (MF 4411), in which ibandronic acid demonstrated anti-fracture efficacy. 
In animal models ibandronic acid produced biochemical changes indicative of dose-dependent 
inhibition of bone resorption, including suppression of urinary biochemical markers of bone collagen 
degradation (such as deoxypyridinoline, and cross-linked N-telopeptides of type I collagen (NTX)). 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Both daily, intermittent (with a dose-free interval of 9 - 10 weeks per quarter) oral doses as well as 
intravenous doses of ibandronic acid in postmenopausal women produced biochemical changes 
indicative of dose-dependent inhibition of bone resorption. 
Bonviva intravenous injection decreased levels of serum C-telopeptide of the alpha chain of Type I 
collagen (CTX) within 3 - 7 days of starting treatment and decreased levels of osteocalcin within 
3 months. 
Following treatment discontinuation, there is a reversion to the pathological pre-treatment rates of 
elevated bone resorption associated with postmenopausal osteoporosis. 
The histological analysis of bone biopsies after two and three years of treatment of postmenopausal 
women with doses of oral ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily and intermittent intravenous doses of up to 
1 mg every 3 months showed bone of normal quality and no indication of a mineralisation defect. An 
expected decrease in bone turnover, normal quality of bone and absence of defects in mineralization 
were also seen after two years of treatment with Bonviva 3 mg injection. 
Clinical efficacy 
Independent risk factors, for example, low BMD, age, the existence of previous fractures, a family 
history of fractures, high bone turnover and low body mass index should be considered in order to 
identify women at increased risk of osteoporotic fractures. 
Bonviva 3 mg injection every 3 months 
Bone mineral density (BMD) 
Bonviva 3 mg intravenous injection, administered every 3 months, was shown to be at least as 
effective as oral ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily in a 2-year, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, non-
inferiority study (BM16550) of postmenopausal women (1386 women aged 55 - 80) with osteoporosis 
(lumbar spine BMD T-score below -2.5 SD at baseline). This was demonstrated in both the primary 
analysis at one year and in the confirmatory analysis at two years endpoint (Table 2). 
The primary analysis of data from study BM16550 at one year and the confirmatory analysis at 2 years 
demonstrated the non-inferiority of 3 mg every 3 months injection dosing regimen compared to 2.5 mg 
oral daily dosing regimen, in terms of mean increases in BMD at lumbar spine, total hip, femoral neck 
and trochanter (Table 2).

Furthermore, Bonviva 3 mg injection every 3 months was proven superior to oral ibandronic acid 
2.5 mg daily for increases in lumbar spine BMD in a prospectively planned analysis at one year, 
p<0.001, and at two years, p<0.001.   
For lumbar spine BMD, 92.1 % of patients receiving 3 mg injection every 3 months increased or 
maintained their BMD after 1 year of treatment (i.e. were responders) compared with 84.9 % of 
patients receiving oral 2.5 mg daily (p=0.002). After 2 years of treatment, 92.8 % of patients receiving 
3 mg injections and 84.7 % of patient receiving 2.5 mg oral therapy had increased or maintained 
lumbar spine BMD (p=0.001). 
For total hip BMD, 82.3 % of patients receiving 3 mg injection every 3 months were responders at one 
year, compared with 75.1 % of patients receiving 2.5 mg daily orally (p=0.02). After 2 years of 
treatment, 85.6 % of patients receiving 3 mg injections and 77.0 % of patient receiving 2.5 mg oral 
therapy had increased or maintained total hip BMD (p=0.004). 
The proportion of patients who increased or maintained their BMD at one year at both lumbar spine 
and total hip was 76.2 % in the 3 mg injection every 3 months arm and 67.2 % in the 2.5 mg daily 
orally arm (p=0.007). At two years, 80.1 % and 68.8 % of patients met this criterion in the 3 mg every 
3 months injection arm and the 2.5 mg daily arm (p=0.001). 
Biochemical markers of bone turn-over 
Clinically meaningful reductions in serum CTX levels were observed at all time points measured. At 
12 months median relative changes from baseline were –58.6 % for the intravenous injection of 3 mg 
every 3 months regimen and –62.6 % for oral 2.5 mg daily regimen. In addition, 64.8 % of patients 
receiving 3 mg every 3 months injection were identified as responders (defined as a decrease ≥50 % 
from baseline), compared with 64.9 % of patients receiving 2.5 mg daily orally. Serum CTX 
reduction was maintained over the 2 years, with more than half of the patients identified as responders 
in both treatment groups. 
Based on the results of study BM 16550, Bonviva 3 mg intravenous injection, administered every 3 
months is expected to be at least as effective in preventing fractures as the oral regimen of ibandronic 
acid 2.5 mg daily. 
Ibandronic acid 2.5 mg daily tablets 
In the initial three-year, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, fracture study (MF 4411), a 
statistically significant and medically relevant decrease in the incidence of new radiographic 
morphometric and clinical vertebral fractures was demonstrated (table 3). In this study, ibandronic 
acid was evaluated at oral doses of 2.5 mg daily and 20 mg intermittently as an exploratory regimen. 
Ibandronic acid was taken 60 minutes before the first food or drink of the day (post-dose fasting 
period). The study enrolled women aged 55 to 80 years, who were at least 5 years postmenopausal, 
who had a BMD at the lumbar spine of -2 to -5 SD below the premenopausal mean (T-score) in at 
least one vertebra [L1-L4], and who had one to four prevalent vertebral fractures. All patients received 
500 mg calcium and 400 IU vitamin D daily. Efficacy was evaluated in 2,928 patients. Ibandronic acid 
2.5 mg administered daily, showed a statistically significant and medically relevant reduction in the 
incidence of new vertebral fractures. This regimen reduced the occurrence of new radiographic 
vertebral fractures by 62 % (p=0.0001) over the three year duration of the study. A relative risk 
reduction of 61 % was observed after 2 years (p=0.0006). No statistically significant difference was 
attained after 1 year of treatment (p=0.056). The anti-fracture effect was consistent over the duration 
of the study. There was no indication of a waning of the effect over time.  
The incidence of clinical vertebral fractures was also significantly reduced by 49 % after 3 years 
(p=0.011). The strong effect on vertebral fractures was furthermore reflected by a statistically 
significant reduction of height loss compared to placebo (p<0.0001).

The treatment effect of ibandronic acid was further assessed in an analysis of the subpopulation of 
patients who, at baseline, had a lumbar spine BMD T-score below –2.5 (table 4). The vertebral 
fracture risk reduction was very consistent with that seen in the overall population.

In the overall patient population of the study MF4411, no reduction was observed for non-vertebral 
fractures, however daily ibandronic acid appeared to be effective in a high-risk subpopulation (femoral 
neck BMD T-score < -3.0), where a non-vertebral fracture risk reduction of 69% was observed. 
Daily oral treatment with ibandronic acid 2.5 mg tablets resulted in progressive increases in BMD at 
vertebral and nonvertebral sites of the skeleton.  
Three-year lumbar spine BMD increase compared to placebo was 5.3 % and 6.5 % compared to 
baseline. Increases at the hip compared to baseline were 2.8 % at the femoral neck, 3.4 % at the total 
hip, and 5.5 % at the trochanter. 
Biochemical markers of bone turnover (such as urinary CTX and serum Osteocalcin) showed the 
expected pattern of suppression to premenopausal levels and reached maximum suppression within a 
period of 3 - 6 months of using 2.5 mg ibandronic acid daily.

A clinically meaningful reduction of 50 % of biochemical markers of bone resorption was observed as 
early as one month after starting treatment with ibandronic acid 2.5 mg. 
Paediatric population (see section 4.2 and section 5.2).  
Bonviva was not studied in the paediatric population, therefore no efficacy or safety data are available 
for this patient population.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The primary pharmacological effects of ibandronic acid on bone are not directly related to actual 
plasma concentrations, as demonstrated by various studies in animals and humans.  
Plasma concentrations of ibandronic acid increase in a dose-proportional manner after intravenous 
administration of 0.5 mg to 6 mg. 
Absorption 
Not applicable 
Distribution 
After initial systemic exposure, ibandronic acid rapidly binds to bone or is excreted into urine. In 
humans, the apparent terminal volume of distribution is at least 90 l and the amount of dose reaching 
the bone is estimated to be 40 – 50 % of the circulating dose. Protein binding in human plasma is 
approximately 85 % - 87 % (determined in vitro at therapeutic ibandronic acid concentrations), and 
thus there is a low potential for interaction with other medicinal products due to displacement. 
Biotransformation 
There is no evidence that ibandronic acid is metabolised in animals or humans. 
Elimination 
Ibandronic acid is removed from the circulation via bone absorption (estimated to be 40 – 50 % in 
postmenopausal women) and the remainder is eliminated unchanged by the kidney.  
The range of observed apparent half-lives is broad, the apparent terminal half-life is generally in the 
range of 10 - 72 hours. As the values calculated are largely a function of the duration of study, the 
dose used, and assay sensitivity, the true terminal half-life is likely to be substantially longer, in 
common with other bisphosphonates. Early plasma levels fall quickly, reaching 10 % of the peak 
values within 3 and 8 hours after intravenous or oral administration, respectively.  
Total clearance of ibandronic acid is low with average values in the range 84 - 160 ml/min. Renal 
clearance (about 60 ml/min in healthy postmenopausal females) accounts for 50 – 60 % of total 
clearance, and is related to creatinine clearance. The difference between the apparent total and renal 
clearances is considered to reflect the uptake by bone. 
The secretory pathway appears not to include known acidic or basic transport systems involved in the 
excretion of other active substances.(see section 4.5). In addition, ibandronic acid does not inhibit the 
major human hepatic P450 isoenzymes and does not induce the hepatic cytochrome P450 system in 
rats. 
Pharmacokinetics in special clinical situations 
Gender 
Pharmacokinetics of ibandronic acid are similar in men and women. 
Race 
There is no evidence for any clinically relevant inter-ethnic differences between Asians and 
Caucasians in ibandronic acid disposition. There is limited data available on patients of African origin. 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with renal impairment  
Renal clearance of ibandronic acid in patients with various degrees of renal impairment is linearly 
related to creatinine clearance (CLcr).  
No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (CLcr equal or 
above 30 ml/min).  
Subjects with severe renal impairment (CLcr less than 30 ml/min) receiving daily oral administration 
of 10 mg ibandronic acid for 21 days, had 2 - 3 fold higher plasma concentrations than subjects with 
normal renal function and total clearance of ibandronic acid was 44 ml/min. After intravenous 
administration of 0.5 mg of ibandronic acid, total, renal, and non-renal clearances decreased by 67 %, 
77 % and 50 %, respectively, in subjects with severe renal failure, but there was no reduction in 
tolerability associated with the increase in exposure. Due to the limited clinical experience, Bonviva is 
not recommended in patients with severe renal impairment (see section 4.2 and section 4.4). The 
pharmacokinetics of ibandronic acid in patients with end-stage renal disease was only assessed in a 
small number of patients managed by haemodialysis, therefore, the pharmacokinetics of ibandronic 
acid in the patients not undergoing haemodialysis is unknown. Due to the limited data available, 
ibandronic acid should not be used in all patients with end-stage renal disease. 
Patients with hepatic impairment (see section 4.2) 
There are no pharmacokinetic data for ibandronic acid in patients who have hepatic impairment. The 
liver has no significant role in the clearance of ibandronic acid, which is not metabolised but is cleared 
by renal excretion and by uptake into bone. Therefore dose adjustment is not necessary in patients 
with hepatic impairment. 
Elderly population (see section 4.2) 
In a multivariate analysis, age was not found to be an independent factor of any of the 
pharmacokinetic parameters studied. As renal function decreases with age, renal function is the only 
factor to take into consideration (see renal impairment section). 
Paediatric population (see section 4.2 and section 5.1) 
There are no data on the use of Bonviva in these age groups.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Toxic effects, e.g. signs of renal damage, were observed in dogs only at exposures considered 
sufficiently in excess of the maximum human exposure, indicating little relevance to clinical use.  
Mutagenicity/Carcinogenicity: 
No indication of carcinogenic potential was observed. Tests for genotoxicity revealed no evidence of 
genetic activity for ibandronic acid. 
Reproductive toxicity: 
Specific studies for the 3-monthly dosing regimen have not been performed. In studies with daily i.v. 
dosing regimen, there was no evidence for a direct foetal toxic or teratogenic effect of ibandronic acid 
in rats and rabbits. Body weight gain was decreased in F1 offspring in rats. In reproductive studies in 
rats by the oral route effects on fertility consisted of increased preimplantation losses at dose levels of 
1 mg/kg/day and higher. In reproductive studies in rats by the intravenous route, ibandronic acid 
decreased sperm counts at doses of 0.3 and 1 mg/kg/day and decreased fertility in males at 1 
mg/kg/day and in females at 1.2 mg/kg/day. Other adverse reactions to ibandronic acid in reproductive 
toxicity studies in the rat were those observed with bisphosphonates as a class. They include a 
decreased number of implantation sites, interference with natural delivery (dystocia), and an increase 
in visceral variations (renal pelvis ureter syndrome).

Content of the pack and other information 
1.  What Bonviva is and what it is used for 
Bonviva belongs to a group of medicines called bisphosphonates. It contains the active substance 
ibandronic acid. Bonviva may reverse bone loss by stopping more loss of bone and increasing bone 
mass in most women who take it, even though they won’t be able to see or feel a difference. Bonviva 
may help lower the chances of breaking bones (fractures). This reduction in fractures was shown for 
the spine but not for the hip. 
Bonviva is prescribed to you to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis because you have an 
increased risk of fractures. Osteoporosis is a thinning and weakening of the bones, which is common 
in women after the menopause. At the menopause, a woman’s ovaries stop producing the female 
hormone, oestrogen, which helps to keep her skeleton healthy. 
The earlier a woman reaches the menopause, the greater her risk of fractures in osteoporosis.  
Other things that can increase the risk of fractures include: 
• 
not enough calcium and vitamin D in the diet 
• 
smoking, or drinking too much alcohol 
• 
not enough walking or other weight-bearing exercise 
• 
a family history of osteoporosis. 
A healthy lifestyle will also help you to get the most benefit from your treatment. This includes:  
• 
• 
• 
eating a balanced diet rich in calcium and vitamin D  
walking or any other weight-bearing exercise  
not smoking; and not drinking too much alcohol.

2.  What you need to know before you take Bonviva 
Do not take Bonviva 
• 
If you are allergic to ibandronic acid, or any of the other ingredients of this medicine listed in 
section 6. 
If you have certain problems with your gullet/food pipe (oesophagus) such as narrowing or 
difficulty swallowing. 
If you can’t stand or sit upright for at least one hour (60 minutes) at a time. 
If you have, or had in the past low blood calcium. Please consult your doctor. 
•

Warnings and precautions 
A side effect called osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) (bone damage in the jaw) has been reported very 
rarely in the post marketing setting in patients receiving Bonviva for osteoporosis.  ONJ can also occur 
after stopping treatment.  
It is important to try and prevent ONJ developing as it is a painful condition that can be difficult to 
treat.  In  order  to reduce the  risk  of  developing osteonecrosis  of the jaw, there are  some  precautions 
you should take. 
Before receiving treatment, tell your doctor/nurse (health care professional) if: 
• 
you have any problems with your mouth or teeth such as poor dental health, gum disease, or a 
planned tooth extraction 
you don’t receive routine dental care or have not had a dental check up for a long time 
you are a smoker (as this may increase the risk of dental problems) 
you have previously been treated with a bisphosphonate (used to treat or prevent bone 
disorders) 
you are taking medicines called corticosteroids (such as prednisolone or dexamethasone) 
you have cancer. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Your doctor may ask you to undergo a dental examination before starting treatment with Bonviva. 
While  being  treated,  you  should  maintain  good  oral  hygiene  (including  regular  teeth  brushing)  and 
receive routine dental check-ups. If you wear dentures you should make sure these fit properly. If you 
are under dental treatment or will undergo dental surgery (e.g. tooth extractions), inform your doctor 
about your dental treatment and tell your dentist that you are being treated with Bonviva. 
Contact your doctor and dentist immediately if you experience any problems with your mouth or teeth 
such as loose teeth, pain or swelling, or non-healing of sores or discharge, as these could be signs of 
osteonecrosis of the jaw. 
Some people need to be especially careful while they’re taking Bonviva. Talk to your doctor before 
taking Bonviva: 
• 
• 
• 
If you have any disturbances of mineral metabolism (such as vitamin D deficiency).  
If your kidneys are not functioning normally. 
If you have any swallowing or digestive problems. 
Irritation, inflammation or ulceration of the gullet/food pipe (oesophagus) often with symptoms of 
severe pain in the chest, severe pain after swallowing food and/or drink, severe nausea, or vomiting 
may occur, especially if you do not drink a full glass of water and/or if you lie down within an hour of 
taking Bonviva. If you develop these symptoms, stop taking Bonviva and tell your doctor straight 
away (see section 3). 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give Bonviva to children or adolescents below 18 years. 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other medicines and Bonviva 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Especially: 
• 
• 
Supplements containing calcium, magnesium, iron or aluminium, as they could possibly 
influence the effects of Bonviva. 
Acetylsalicylic acid and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) (including 
ibuprofen, diclofenac sodium and naproxen) may irritate the stomach and intestine. Bonviva 
may also do so. So be especially careful if you take painkillers or anti-inflammatories while 
you’re taking Bonviva.  
After swallowing your monthly Bonviva tablet, wait for 1 hour before taking any other medication, 
including indigestion tablets, calcium supplements, or vitamins. 
Bonviva with food and drink: 
Do not take Bonviva with food. Bonviva is less effective if it’s taken with food. 
You can drink water but no other drinks  
After you have taken Bonviva, please wait for 1 hour before you can have your first food and further 
drinks. (see 3. How to take Bonviva). 
Pregnancy and breast feeding 
Bonviva is for use only by postmenopausal women and must not be taken by women who could still 
have a baby.  
Do not take Bonviva if you are pregnant or breast feeding.  
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
You can drive and use machines as it’s expected that Bonviva has no or negligible effect on your 
ability to drive and use machines. 
Bonviva contains lactose. 
If you have been told by your doctor that you cannot tolerate or digest some sugars (e.g. if you have a 
galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or have problems with glucose-galactose 
absorption), talk to your doctor before taking this medicine. 
3. 
How to take Bonviva 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure. 
The usual dose of Bonviva is one tablet once a month. 
Taking your monthly tablet 
It’s important to follow these instructions carefully. They are designed to help your Bonviva tablet 
reach your stomach quickly, so it’s less likely to cause irritation. 
• 
• 
• 
Take one Bonviva 150 mg tablet once a month. 
Choose one day of the month that will be easy to remember. You can choose either the same 
date (such as the 1st of each month) or the same day (such as the first Sunday of each month) to 
take your Bonviva tablet. Choose the date that best fits your routine. 
Take your Bonviva tablet at least 6 hours after you last had anything to eat or drink except 
water. 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
Take your Bonviva tablet 
• 
• 
after you first get up for the day, and 
before you have anything to eat or drink (on an empty stomach). 
Swallow your tablet with a full glass of water (at least 180 ml).  
Do not take your tablet with water with a high concentration of calcium, fruit juice or any other 
drinks. If there is a concern regarding potentially high levels of calcium in the tap water (hard water), 
it is advised to use bottled water with a low mineral content. 
• 
• 
Swallow your tablet whole, do not chew it, crush it or let it dissolve in your mouth. 
For the next hour (60 minutes) after you’ve taken your tablet 
• 
do not lie down; if you do not stay upright (standing or sitting), some of the medicine 
could leak back into your oesophagus 
• 
do not eat anything 
• 
• 
do not drink anything (except water if you need it) 
do not take any other medicines. 
• 
After you’ve waited for an hour, you can have your first food and drink of the day. Once you’ve 
eaten, it’s OK to lie down if you wish, and to take any other medication you need. 
Continuing to take Bonviva 
It’s important to keep taking Bonviva every month, as long as your doctor prescribes it for you. After 
5 years of using Bonviva, please consult with your doctor whether you should continue to take 
Bonviva. 
If you take more Bonviva than you should 
If you’ve taken more than one tablet by mistake, drink a full glass of milk and talk to your doctor 
straight away. 
Do not make yourself vomit, and do not lie down — this could cause Bonviva to irritate your 
oesophagus. 
If you forget to take Bonviva 
•  If you forget to take your tablet on the morning of your chosen day, do not take a tablet later 
in the day.  
Instead, consult your calendar and find out when your next scheduled dose is. 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  If you forgot to take your tablet on your chosen day and your next scheduled dose is only 1 
to 7 days away… 
Never take two Bonviva tablets within the same week. You should wait until the next 
scheduled dose is due and take it as normal; then, continue taking one tablet once a month on 
the scheduled days you’ve marked on your calendar.  
•  If you forgot to take your tablet on your chosen day and your next scheduled dose is more 
than 7 days away…  
You should take one tablet the next morning after the day you remember; then, continue taking 
one tablet once a month on the scheduled days you’ve marked on your calendar.

Bonviva 3 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe should be injected intravenously over a 
period of 15 - 30 seconds. 
The solution is irritant, therefore strict adherence to the intravenous route of administration is 
important. If you inadvertently inject into the tissues around the vein, patients may experience local 
irritation, pain and inflammation at the injection site. 
Bonviva 3 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe must not be mixed with calcium-containing 
solutions (such as Ringer-Lactate solution, calcium heparin) or other intravenously administered 
medicinal products. Where Bonviva is administered via an existing intravenous infusion line, the 
intravenous infusate should be restricted to either isotonic saline or 50 mg/ml (5 %) glucose solution. 
Missed dose: 
If a dose is missed, the injection should be administered as soon as convenient. Thereafter, injections 
should be scheduled every 3 months from the date of the last injection. 
Overdose: 
No specific information is available on the treatment of overdosage with Bonviva.  
Based on knowledge of this class of compounds, intravenous overdosage may result in hypocalcaemia, 
hypophosphataemia, and hypomagnesaemia, which can cause paraesthesia. In severe cases 
intravenous infusion of appropriate doses of calcium gluconate, potassium or sodium phosphate, and 
magnesium sulfate, may be needed. 
General advice: 
Bonviva 3 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe like other bisphosphonates administered 
intravenously, may cause a transient decrease in serum calcium values. 
Hypocalcaemia and other disturbances of bone and mineral metabolism should be assessed and 
effectively treated before starting Bonviva injection therapy. Adequate intake of calcium and 
vitamin D is important in all patients. All patients must receive supplemental calcium and vitamin D. 
Patients with concomitant diseases, or who use medicinal products which have a potential for 
undesirable effects on the kidney, should be reviewed regularly in line with good medical practice 
during treatment.  
Any unused solution for injection, syringe and injection needle should be disposed of in accordance 
with local requirements.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking  into  account  the  PRAC  Assessment  Report  on  the  PSUR(s)  for  ibandronic  acid,  sodium 
ibandronate, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In  view  of  available  data  on  hypocalcaemia  from  spontaneous  reports  including  in  some  cases  a 
close temporal relationship, a positive de-challenge and the fact that hypocalcaemia is an identified 
risk for ibandronic acid, the PRAC considers that a causal relationship between ibandronic acid and 
hypocalcaemia  is  established.  The  PRAC  concluded  that  the  product  information  of  products 
containing ibandronic acid (osteoporotic indication (Bonviva)) should be amended accordingly. 
Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to add the  ADR hypocalcaemia with a frequency uncommon. 
The Package leaflet is updated accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ibandronic acid, sodium ibandronate the CHMP is of 
the  opinion  that  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  the  medicinal  product(s)  containing  ibandronic  acid, 
sodium ibandronate is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

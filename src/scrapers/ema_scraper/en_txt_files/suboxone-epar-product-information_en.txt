4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment must be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the management of opiate 
dependence/addiction.  
Precautions to be taken before induction 
Prior to treatment initiation, consideration should be given to the type of opioid dependence (i.e. long- 
or short-acting opioid), the time since last opioid use and the degree of opioid dependence. To avoid 
precipitating  withdrawal,  induction  with  buprenorphine/naloxone  or  buprenorphine  only  should  be 
undertaken  when  objective  and  clear  signs  of  withdrawal  are  evident  (demonstrated  e.g.  by  a  score 
indicating mild to moderate withdrawal on the validated Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale, COWS).  
o  For  patients  dependent  upon  heroin  or  short-acting  opioids, 
first  dose  of 
buprenorphine/naloxone  must  be  taken  when  signs  of  withdrawal  appear,  but  not  less  than 
6 hours after the patient last used opioids. 
the 
o  For patients receiving methadone, the dose of methadone must be reduced to a maximum of 
30 mg/day before beginning buprenorphine/naloxone therapy. The long half life of methadone 
first  dose  of 
should  be  considered  when  starting  buprenorphine/naloxone.  The 
buprenorphine/naloxone should be taken only when signs of withdrawal appear, but not less 
than 24 hours after the patient last used methadone. Buprenorphine may precipitate symptoms 
of withdrawal in patients dependent upon methadone.  
Posology 
Initiation therapy (induction) 
The recommended starting dose in adults and adolescents over 15 years of age is 4 mg/1 mg and can be 
repeated up to a maximum dose of 12 mg/ 3 mg on day 1 to minimise undue withdrawal symptoms and 
retain  the patient in treatment.  
During the initiation of treatment, daily supervision of dosing is recommended to ensure proper 
sublingual placement of the dose and to observe patient response to treatment as a guide to effective 
dose titration according to clinical effect.   
Dosage stabilisation and maintenance therapy 
Following treatment induction on day 1, the patient must be rapidly stabilised  on an adequate 
maintenance dose  by titrating to achieve a dose that holds the patient in treatment and suppresses 
opioid withdrawal effects and is guided by reassessment of the clinical and psychological status of the 
patient. The maximum single daily dose should not exceed 24 mg buprenorphine.  
During maintenance therapy, it may be necessary to periodically restabilise the patient on a new 
maintenance dose in response to changing patient needs. 
Less than daily dosing  
After  a  satisfactory  stabilisation  has  been  achieved  the  frequency  of  Suboxone  dosing  may  be 
decreased to dosing every other day at twice the individually titrated daily dose. For example, a patient 
stabilised to receive a daily dose of 8 mg/2 mg may be given 16 mg/4 mg  on alternate days, with no 
dose on the intervening days. In some patients, after a satisfactory stabilisation has been achieved, the 
frequency  of  Suboxone  dosing  may  be  decreased  to  3  times  a  week  (for  example  on  Monday, 
Wednesday  and  Friday).  The  dose  on  Monday  and  Wednesday  should  be  twice  the  individually 
titrated daily dose, and the dose on Friday should be three times the individually titrated daily dose, 
with no dose on the intervening days. However, the dose given on any one day should not exceed 24 
mg . Patients requiring a titrated daily dose> 8 mg /day may not find this regimen adequate. 
Medical withdrawal  
After  a  satisfactory  stabilisation  has  been  achieved,  if  the  patient  agrees,  the  dose  may  be  reduced 
gradually to a lower maintenance dose; in some favourable cases, treatment may be discontinued. The 
availability  of  the  sublingual  tablet  in  doses  of  2 mg/0.5 mg  and  8 mg/2 mg  allows  for  a  downward 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
titration  of  dose.  For  patients  who  may  require  a  lower  buprenorphine  dose,  buprenorphine  0.4 mg 
sublingual tablet may be used. Patients should be monitored following medical withdrawal because of 
the potential for relapse. 
Switching between buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone 
When used sublingually, buprenorphine/naloxone and buprenorphine have similar clinical effects and 
are interchangeable; however, before switching between buprenorphine/naloxone and buprenorphine, 
the prescriber and patient should agree to the change, and the patient should be monitored in case a 
need to readjust the dose occurs. 
Switching between sublingual tablet and film (where applicable) 
Patients being switched between Suboxone sublingual tablets and Suboxone film should be started on 
the same dose as the previously administered medicinal product. However, dose adjustments may be 
necessary when switching between medicinal products. Due to the potentially greater relative 
bioavailability of Suboxone film compared to Suboxone sublingual tablets, patients switching from 
sublingual tablets to film should be monitored for overdose. Those switching from film to sublingual 
tablets should be monitored for withdrawal or other indications of underdosing. In clinical studies, the 
pharmacokinetics of Suboxone film were not consistently shown to be similar to the respective dosage 
strengths of Suboxone sublingual tablets, as well as to the combinations (see section 5.2). If switching 
between Suboxone film and Suboxone sublingual tablets, the patient should be monitored in case a 
need to readjust the dose occurs. Combining different formulations or alternating between film and 
sublingual tablet formulations is not advised. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
The safety and efficacy of buprenorphine/naloxone in elderly patients over 65 years of age have not 
been established. No recommendation on posology can be made. 
Hepatic impairment 
As  buprenorphine/naloxone  pharmacokinetics  may  be  altered  in  patients  with  hepatic  impairment, 
lower initial doses and careful dose titration in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment are 
recommended. Buprenorphine/naloxone is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
(see sections 4.3 and 5.2).  
Renal impairment

Paediatric population 
The  safety  and  efficacy  of  buprenorphine/naloxone  in  children  below  the  age  of  15 years  have  not 
been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Physicians  must  warn  patients  that  the  sublingual  route  is  the  only  effective  and  safe  route  of 
administration for this medicinal product (see section 4.4). The tablet is to be placed under the tongue 
until  completely  dissolved.  Patients  should  not  swallow  or  consume  food  or  drink  until  the  tablet is 
completely dissolved.  
The dose can be made up from multiple Suboxone tablets of different strengths, which may be taken 
all at the same time or in two divided portions; the second portion to be taken directly after the first 
portion has dissolved.

4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Severe respiratory insufficiency

Acute alcoholism or delirium tremens. 
Concomitant administration of opioid antagonists (naltrexone, nalmefene) for the treatment of alcohol 
or opioid dependence. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Misuse, abuse and diversion 
Buprenorphine can be misused or abused in a manner similar to other opioids, legal or illicit. Some 
risks  of  misuse  and  abuse  include  overdose,  spread  of  blood  borne  viral  or  localised  and  systemic 
infections, respiratory depression and hepatic injury. Buprenorphine misuse by someone other than the 
intended patient poses the additional risk of new drug dependent individuals using buprenorphine as 
the primary drug of abuse, and may occur if the medicinal product is distributed for illicit use directly 
by the intended patient or if it is not safeguarded against theft.  
Suboptimal  treatment  with  buprenorphine/naloxone  may  prompt  misuse  by  the  patient,  leading  to 
overdose  or  treatment  dropout.  A  patient  who  is  underdosed  with  buprenorphine/naloxone  may 
continue responding to uncontrolled withdrawal symptoms by self-medicating with opioids, alcohol or 
other sedative-hypnotics such as benzodiazepines. 
To  minimise the risk  of  misuse,  abuse and  diversion,  appropriate  precautions should  be  taken  when 
prescribing  and  dispensing  buprenorphine,  such  as  avoiding  prescribing  multiple  refills  early  in 
treatment, and conducting patient follow-up visits with clinical monitoring that is appropriate for the 
patient's needs.  
Combining  buprenorphine  with  naloxone  in  Suboxone  is  intended  to  deter  misuse  and  abuse  of  the 
buprenorphine. Intravenous or intranasal misuse of Suboxone is expected to be less likely than with 
buprenorphine  alone  since  the  naloxone  in  this  medicinal  product  can  precipitate  withdrawal  in 
individual’s dependent on heroin, methadone, or other opioid agonists.  
Sleep-related breathing disorders 
Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnoea (CSA) and sleep-
related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who 
present with CSA, consider decreasing the total opioid dosage. 
Respiratory depression 
A  number  of  cases  of  death  due  to  respiratory  depression  have  been  reported,  particularly  when 
buprenorphine  was  used  in  combination  with  benzodiazepines  (see  section  4.5)  or  when 
buprenorphine was not used according to the prescribing information.  Deaths have also been reported 
in association with concomitant administration of buprenorphine and other depressants such as alcohol 
or other opioids. If buprenorphine is administered to some non-opioid dependent individuals, who are 
not tolerant to the effects of opioids, potentially fatal respiratory depression may occur. 
This medicinal product should be used with care in patients with asthma or respiratory insufficiency 
(e.g.  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease,  cor  pulmonale,  decreased  respiratory  reserve,  hypoxia, 
hypercapnia,  pre-existing  respiratory  depression  or  kyphoscoliosis  (curvature  of  spine  leading  to 
potential shortness of breath)). 
Buprenorphine/naloxone may cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children and non-
dependent persons in case of accidental or deliberate ingestion. Patients must be warned to store the 
blister safely, to never open the blister in advance, to keep them out of the reach of children and other 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
household members,  and  not to  take  this medicinal  product in front  of  children.  An  emergency  unit 
should be contacted immediately in case of accidental ingestion or suspicion of ingestion. 
CNS depression 
Buprenorphine/naloxone  may  cause  drowsiness,  particularly  when  taken  together  with  alcohol  or 
central nervous system depressants (such as benzodiazepines, tranquilisers, sedatives or hypnotics see 
sections 4.5 and 4.7). 
Risk from concomitant use of sedative medicinal products such as benzodiazepines or related 
medicinal products 
Concomitant use of buprenorphine/naloxone and sedative medicinal products such as benzodiazepines 
or related medicinal products may result in sedation, respiratory depression, coma and death. Because 
of these risks, concomitant prescribing with these sedative medicinal products should be reserved for 
patients for whom alternative treatment options are not possible. If a decision is made to prescribe 
buprenorphine/naloxone concomitantly with sedative medicinal products, the lowest effective dose of 
the sedative medicines should be used, and the duration of treatment should be as short as possible. 
The patients should be followed closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and 
sedation. In this respect, it is strongly recommended to inform patients and their caregivers to be aware 
of these symptoms (see section 4.5). 
Serotonin syndrome 
Concomitant administration of Suboxone and other serotonergic agents, such as MAO inhibitors, 
selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs) 
or tricyclic antidepressants may result in serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition 
(see section 4.5). 
If concomitant treatment with other serotonergic agents is clinically warranted, careful observation of 
the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. 
Symptoms of serotonin syndrome may include mental-status changes, autonomic instability, 
neuromuscular abnormalities, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms. 
If serotonin syndrome is suspected, a dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy should be 
considered depending on the severity of the symptoms. 
Dependence 
Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the µ (mu)-opiate receptor and chronic administration produces 
dependence of the opioid type.  Studies in animals, as well as clinical experience, have demonstrated 
that buprenorphine may produce dependence, but at a lower level than a full agonist e.g. morphine.  
Abrupt discontinuation  of treatment is  not  recommended  as  it  may result  in a withdrawal  syndrome 
that may be delayed in onset. 
Hepatitis and hepatic events 
Cases of acute hepatic injury have been reported in opioid-dependent addicts both in clinical trials and 
in  post  marketing  adverse  reaction  reports.  The  spectrum  of  abnormalities  ranges  from  transient 
asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, 
hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy and death. In many cases the presence of pre-existing 
mitochondrial impairment (genetic disease, liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or 
hepatitis C virus, alcohol abuse, anorexia, concomitant use of other potentially hepatotoxic medicinal 
product) and ongoing injecting drug use may have a causative or contributory role. These underlying 
factors  must  be  taken  into  consideration  before  prescribing  buprenorphine/naloxone  and  during 
treatment. When a hepatic event is suspected, further biological and aetiological evaluation is required. 
Depending upon the findings, the medicinal product may be discontinued cautiously so as to prevent 
withdrawal symptoms and to prevent a return to illicit drug use. If the treatment is continued, hepatic 
function should be monitored closely. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Precipitation of opioid withdrawal syndrome  
When  initiating  treatment  with  buprenorphine/naloxone,  the  physician  must  be  aware  of  the  partial 
agonist  profile  of  buprenorphine  and  that  it  can  precipitate  withdrawal  in  opioid-dependent  patients, 
particularly if administered less than 6 hours after the last use of heroin or other short-acting opioid, or 
if  administered  less  than  24 hours  after  the  last  dose  of  methadone.  Patients  should  be  clearly 
monitored during the switching period from buprenorphine or methadone to buprenorphine/naloxone 
since  withdrawal  symptoms  have  been  reported.  To  avoid  precipitating  withdrawal,  induction  with 
buprenorphine/naloxone  should  be  undertaken  when  objective  signs  of  withdrawal  are  evident  (see 
section 4.2). 
Withdrawal symptoms may also be associated with sub-optimal dosing. 
Hepatic impairment 
The  effects  of  hepatic  impairment  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  buprenorphine  and  naloxone  were 
evaluated in a post-marketing study. Both buprenorphine and naloxone are extensively metabolised in 
the liver, and plasma levels were found to behigher for both buprenorphine and naloxone in patients 
with  moderate  and  severe  hepatic  impairment  compared  with  healthy  subjects.    Patients  should  be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of precipitated opioid withdrawal, toxicity or overdose caused by 
increased levels of naloxone and/or buprenorphine.  
Baseline  liver  function  tests  and  documentation  of  viral  hepatitis  status  is  recommended  prior  to 
commencing therapy. Patients who are positive for viral hepatitis, on concomitant medicinal products 
(see  section  4.5)  and/or  have  existing  liver  dysfunction  are  at  greater  risk  of  liver  injury.  Regular 
monitoring of liver function is recommended (see section 4.4). 
Buprenorphine/naloxone  should  be  used  with  caution  in  patients  with  moderate  hepatic  impairment 
(see  sections 4.3  and  5.2). 
the  use  of

insufficiency 
Renal impairment 
Renal  elimination  may  be prolonged  since  30 %  of the  administered  dose is  eliminated  by  the renal 
route.  Metabolites  of  buprenorphine  accumulate  in  patients  with  renal  failure.  Caution  is 
recommended when dosing patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <30 ml/min) 
(see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
CYP 3A4 inhibitors 
Medicinal  products  that  inhibit  the  enzyme  CYP3A4  may  give  rise  to  increased  concentrations  of 
buprenorphine.  A  reduction  of  the  buprenorphine/naloxone  dose  may  be  needed.  Patients  already 
treated  with  CYP3A4  inhibitors  should  have  their  dose  of  buprenorphine/naloxone  titrated  carefully 
since a reduced dose may be sufficient in these patients (see section 4.5). 
Class effects  
Opioids may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. 
Opioids may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which may cause seizures, so opioids should be used 
with  caution  in  patients  with  head  injury,  intracranial  lesions,  in  other  circumstances  where 
cerebrospinal pressure may be increased, or in patients with a history of seizure. 
Opioids  should  be  used  with  caution  in  patients  with  hypotension,  prostatic  hypertrophy  or  urethral 
stenosis. 
Opioid-induced miosis, changes in the level of consciousness, or changes in the perception of pain as a 
symptom of disease may interfere with patient evaluation or obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of 
concomitant disease. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Opioids should be used with caution in patients with myxoedema, hypothyroidism, or adrenal cortical 
insufficiency (e.g., Addison's disease). 
Opioids  have  been shown to increase intracholedochal  pressure,  and  should  be used  with  caution in 
patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract. 
Opioids should be administered with caution to elderly or debilitated patients. 
The concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) might produce an exaggeration of the 
effects of opioids, based on experience with morphine (see section 4.5). 
Excipients 
This  medicinal  product  contains  lactose.    Patients  with  rare  hereditary  problems  of  galactose 
intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine. 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
Paediatric population 
Use in adolescents (age 15 - <18) 
Due to the lack of data in adolescents (age 15 - <18), patients in this age group should be more closely 
monitored during treatment. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Buprenorphine/naloxone should not be taken together with: 
• 
Alcoholic  drinks  or  medicinal  products  containing  alcohol,  as  alcohol  increases  the  sedative 
effect of buprenorphine (see section 4.7). 
Suboxone should be used cautiously when co-administered with: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Sedatives such as benzodiazepines or related medicinal products 
The concomitant use of opioids with sedative medicinal products such as benzodiazepines or 
related medicinal products increases the risk of sedation, respiratory depression, coma and death 
because of additive CNS depressant effect. The dose and duration of concomitant use of 
sedative medicinal products should be limited (see section 4.4). Patients should be warned that 
it is extremely dangerous to self-administer non-prescribed benzodiazepines while taking this 
medicinal product and should also be cautioned to use benzodiazepines concurrently with this 
medicinal product only as directed by their physician (see section 4.4). 
Other central nervous system depressants, other opioid derivatives (e.g. methadone, analgesics 
and  antitussives),  certain  antidepressants,  sedative  H1-receptor  antagonists,  barbiturates, 
anxiolytics  other  than  benzodiazepines,  neuroleptics,  clonidine  and  related  substances:  these 
combinations  increase  central  nervous  system  depression.  The  reduced  level  of  alertness  can 
make driving and using machines hazardous. 
Furthermore,  adequate  analgesia  may  be  difficult  to  achieve  when  administering  a  full  opioid 
agonist in patients receiving buprenorphine/naloxone. Therefore the potential to overdose with a 
full  agonist  exists,  especially  when  attempting  to  overcome  buprenorphine  partial  agonist 
effects, or when buprenorphine plasma levels are declining.  
Serotonergic  medicinal  products,  such  as  MAO  inhibitors,  selective  serotonin  re-uptake 
tricyclic 
inhibitors  (SSRIs),  serotonin  norepinephrine  re-uptake 
inhibitor  (SNRIs)  or 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
antidepressants  as  the  risk  of  serotonin  syndrome,  a  potentially  life-threatening  condition,  is 
increased (see section 4.4). 
Naltrexone and nalmefene are opioid antagonists that can block the pharmacological effects of 
buprenorphine.  Co-administration  during  buprenorphine/naloxone  treatment  is  contraindicated 
due  to  the  potentially  dangerous  interaction  that  may  precipitate  a  sudden  onset  of  prolonged 
and intense opioid withdrawal symptoms (see section 4.3). 
CYP3A4 inhibitors: an interaction study of buprenorphine with ketoconazole (a potent inhibitor 
of  CYP3A4)  resulted  in  increased  Cmax  and  AUC  (area  under  the  curve)  of  buprenorphine 
(approximately  50 %  and  70 %  respectively)  and,  to  a  lesser  extent,  of  norbuprenorphine. 
Patients  receiving  Suboxone  should  be  closely  monitored,  and  may  require  dose-reduction  if 
combined  with  potent  CYP3A4  inhibitors  (e.g.  protease  inhibitors  like  ritonavir,  nelfinavir  or 
indinavir or azole antifungals such as ketoconazole or itraconazole, macrolide antibiotics).  
CYP3A4  inducers:  Concomitant  use  of  CYP3A4  inducers  with  buprenorphine  may  decrease

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of buprenorphine/naloxone in pregnant women.  
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is 
unknown. 
Towards the end of pregnancy buprenorphine may induce respiratory depression in the newborn infant 
even after a short period of administration. Long-term administration of buprenorphine during the last 
three months of pregnancy may cause a withdrawal syndrome in the neonate (e.g. hypertonia, neonatal 
tremor, neonatal agitation, myoclonus or convulsions). The syndrome is generally delayed for several 
hours to several days after birth. 
Due to the long half-life of buprenorphine, neonatal monitoring for several days should be considered 
at  the  end  of  pregnancy,  to  prevent  the  risk  of  respiratory  depression  or  withdrawal  syndrome  in 
neonates.  
Furthermore,  the  use  of  buprenorphine/naloxone  during  pregnancy  should  be  assessed  by  the 
physician.  Buprenorphine/naloxone  should  be  used  during  pregnancy  only  if  the  potential  benefit 
outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It  is  unknown  whether  naloxone  is  excreted  in  human  milk.  Buprenorphine  and  its  metabolites  are 
excreted  in  human  milk.  In  rat’s  buprenorphine  has  been  found  to  inhibit  lactation.  Therefore, 
breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment with Suboxone. 
Fertility 
Animal studies have shown a reduction in female fertility at high doses (systemic exposure > 2.4 times 
the human exposure at the maximum recommended dose of 24 mg buprenorphine, based on AUC, see 
section 5.3).

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Buprenorphine/naloxone  has  minor  to  moderate  influence  on  the  ability  to  drive  and  use  machines 
when  administered  to  opioid  dependent  patients.  This  medicinal  product  may  cause  drowsiness, 
dizziness,  or  impaired  thinking,  especially  during  treatment  induction  and  dose  adjustment.  If  taken 
together with alcohol or central nervous system depressants, the effect is likely to be more pronounced 
(see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Patients  should  be  cautioned  about  driving  or  operating  hazardous  machinery 
buprenorphine/naloxone may adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported treatment related adverse reactions reported during the pivotal clinical 
studies  were  constipation  and  symptoms  commonly  associated  with  drug  withdrawal  (i.e.  insomnia, 
headache, nausea, hyperhidrosis and pain). Some reports of seizure, vomiting, diarrhoea, and elevated 
liver function tests were considered serious.

Description of selected adverse reactions  
In cases of intravenous drug misuse, some adverse reactions are attributed to the act of misuse rather 
than the medicinal product and include local reactions, sometimes septic (abscess, cellulitis), and 
potentially serious acute hepatitis, and other infections such as pneumonia, endocarditis have been 
reported (see section 4.4). 
In patients presenting with marked drug dependence, initial administration of buprenorphine can 
produce a drug withdrawal syndrome similar to that associated with naloxone (see sections 4.2 and 
4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting  suspected  adverse  reactions  after  authorisation  of  the  medicinal  product  is  important.  It 
allows  continued  monitoring  of  the  benefit/risk  balance  of  the  medicinal  product.  Healthcare 
professionals  are  asked  to  report  any  suspected  adverse  reactions  via  the  national  reporting  system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
Respiratory  depression  as  a  result  of  central  nervous  system  depression  is  the  primary  symptom 
requiring intervention in the case of overdose because it may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Signs 
of overdose may also include somnolence, amblyopia, miosis, hypotension, nausea, vomiting and/or 
speech disorders. 
Management 
General  supportive  measures  should  be  instituted,  including  close  monitoring  of  respiratory  and 
cardiac status of the patient.  Symptomatic treatment of respiratory depression, and standard intensive 
care measures, should be implemented. A patent airway and assisted or controlled ventilation must be 
assured. The patient should be transferred to an environment within which full resuscitation facilities 
are available. 
If the patient vomits, care must be taken to prevent aspiration of the vomitus. 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Use of an opioid antagonist (i.e., naloxone) is recommended, despite the modest effect it may have in 
reversing the respiratory symptoms of buprenorphine compared with its effects on full agonist opioid 
agents. 
If naloxone is used, the long duration of action of buprenorphine should be taken into consideration 
when determining the length of treatment and medical surveillance needed to reverse the effects of an 
overdose.  Naloxone  can  be  cleared  more  rapidly  than  buprenorphine,  allowing  for  a  return  of 
previously controlled buprenorphine overdose symptoms, so a continuing infusion may be necessary. 
If  infusion  is  not  possible,  repeated  dosing  with  naloxone may  be  required.  Ongoing  intravenous 
infusion rates should be titrated to patient response.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic  group:  Other  nervous  system  drugs,  drugs  used  in  addictive  disorders,  ATC 
code: N07BC51. 
Mechanism of action 
Buprenorphine  is  an  opioid  partial  agonist/antagonist  which  binds  to  the  µ  and  κ  (kappa)  opioid 
receptors of the brain. Its activity in opioid maintenance treatment is attributed to its slowly reversible 
properties  with  the  µ-opioid  receptors  which,  over  a  prolonged  period,  might  minimise  the  need  of 
addicted patients for drugs. 
Opioid agonist ceiling effects were observed during clinical pharmacology studies in opioid-dependent 
persons. 
Naloxone  is  an  antagonist  at  µ-opioid  receptors.  When  administered  orally  or  sublingually  in  usual 
doses to patients experiencing opioid withdrawal, naloxone exhibits little or no pharmacological effect 
because of its almost complete first pass metabolism. However, when administered intravenously to 
opioid-dependent persons, the presence of naloxone in Suboxone produces marked opioid antagonist 
effects and opioid withdrawal, thereby deterring intravenous abuse. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Efficacy  and  safety  data  for  buprenorphine/naloxone  are  primarily  derived  from  a  one-year  clinical 
trial,  comprising  a  4-week  randomised  double  blind  comparison  of  buprenorphine/naloxone, 
buprenorphine  and  placebo  followed  by  a  48 week  safety  study  of  buprenorphine/naloxone.  In  this 
trial,  326 heroin-addicted  subjects  were  randomly  assigned  to  either  buprenorphine/naloxone  16 mg 
per day, 16 mg buprenorphine per day or placebo. For subjects randomized to either active treatment, 
dosing began with 8 mg of buprenorphine on Day 1, followed by 16 mg (two 8 mg) of buprenorphine 
on  Day 2.  On  Day 3,  those  randomized  to  receive  buprenorphine/naloxone  were  switched  to  the 
combination  tablet.  Subjects  were  seen  daily  in  the  clinic  (Monday  through  Friday)  for  dosing  and 
efficacy assessments. Take-home doses were provided for weekends. The primary study comparison 
was to assess the efficacy of buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone individually against placebo. 
The  percentage  of  thrice-weekly  urine  samples  that  were  negative  for  non-study  opioids  was 
statistically  higher  for  both  buprenorphine/naloxone  versus  placebo  (p < 0.0001)  and  buprenorphine 
versus placebo (p < 0.0001). 
In  a  double-blind,  double-dummy,  parallel-group  study  comparing  buprenorphine  ethanolic  solution 
versus a full agonist active control, 162 subjects were randomized to receive the ethanolic sublingual 
solution of buprenorphine at 8 mg/day (a dose which is roughly comparable to a dose of 12 mg/day of 
buprenorphine/naloxone), or two relatively low doses of active control, one of which was low enough 
to  serve  as  an  alternative  to  placebo,  during  a  3 to10 day  induction  phase,  a  16-week  maintenance 
phase and a 7-week detoxification phase. Buprenorphine was titrated to maintenance dose by Day 3; 
active control doses were titrated more gradually. Based on retention in treatment and the percentage 
of thrice-weekly urine samples negative for non-study opioids, buprenorphine was more effective than 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the low dose of the control, in keeping heroin addicts in treatment and in reducing their use of opioids 
while  in  treatment.  The  effectiveness  of  buprenorphine,  8 mg  per  day  was  similar  to  that  of  the 
moderate active control dose, but equivalence was not demonstrated. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Buprenorphine 
Absorption 
Buprenorphine,  when  taken  orally,  undergoes  first-pass  metabolism  with  N-dealkylation  and 
glucuroconjugation in the small intestine and the liver. The use of this medicinal product by the oral 
route is therefore inappropriate. 
Peak plasma concentrations are achieved 90 minutes after sublingual administration. Plasma levels of 
buprenorphine  increased  with  increasing  sublingual  dose  of  buprenorphine/naloxone.  Both  Cmax  and 
AUC  of  buprenorphine  increased  with  the  increase  in  dose  (in  the  range  of  4-16 mg),  although  the 
increase was less than dose-proportional.

Distribution 
The absorption of buprenorphine is followed by a rapid distribution phase (distribution half-life of 2 to 
5 hours). 
Buprenorphine is highly lipophilic, which leads to rapid penetration of the blood-brain barrier. 
Buprenorphine is approximately 96 % protein bound, primarily to alpha and beta globulin. 
Biotransformation 
Buprenorphine  is  primarily  metabolised  through  N-dealkylation  by  liver  microsomal  CYP3A4.  The 
parent  molecule  and  the  primary  dealkylated  metabolite,  norbuprenorphine,  undergo  subsequent 
glucuronidation.  Norbuprenorphine  binds  to  opioid  receptors  in vitro;  however,  it  is  not  known 
whether norbuprenorphine contributes to the overall effect of buprenorphine/naloxone. 
Elimination 
Elimination  of  buprenorphine  is  bi-  or  tri-exponential,  and  has  a  mean  half-life  from  plasma  of 
32 hours.  
Buprenorphine  is  excreted  in  the  faeces  (~70 %)  by  biliary  excretion  of  the  glucuroconjugated 
metabolites, the rest (~30 %) being excreted in the urine. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Buprenorphine Cmax and AUC increased in a linear fashion with the increasing dose (in the range of 4 
to 16 mg), although the increase was not directly dose-proportional. 
Naloxone 
Absorption and distribution  
Following sublingual administration of buprenorphine/naloxone, plasma naloxone concentrations are 
low  and  decline  rapidly.  Naloxone  mean  peak  plasma  concentrations  were  too  low  to  assess  dose-
proportionality.  
Naloxone  has  not  been  found  to  affect  the  pharmacokinetics  of  buprenorphine,  and  both 
buprenorphine  sublingual  tablets  and  buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual  film  deliver  similar  plasma 
concentrations of buprenorphine.  
Distribution 
Naloxone is approximately 45 % protein bound, primarily to albumin. 
Biotransformation  
Naloxone is metabolized in the liver, primarily by glucuronide conjugation, and excreted in the urine. 
Naloxone undergoes direct glucuronidation to naloxone 3-glucuronide, as well as N-dealkylation and 
reduction of the 6-oxo group. 
Elimination 
Naloxone is excreted in the urine, with a mean half-life of elimination from plasma ranging from 0.9 
to 9 hours.

buprenorphine/naloxone.  No  dose  modification  based  on  renal  function  is  required  but  caution  is 
recommended when dosing subjects with severe renal impairment (see section 4.3).

Hepatic impairment 
The  effect  of  hepatic  impairment  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  buprenorphine  and  naloxone  were 
evaluated in a post-marketing study.   
Table 4 summarises the results from a clinical trial in which the exposure of buprenorphine and 
naloxone was determined after administering a buprenorphine/naloxone 2.0/0.5 mg sublingual tablet 
in healthy subjects, and in subjects with varied degrees of hepatic impairment.

hepatic function. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
The combination of buprenorphine and naloxone has been investigated in acute and repeated dose (up 
to  90 days  in  rats)  toxicity  studies  in  animals.  No  synergistic  enhancement  of  toxicity  has  been 
observed.  Undesirable  effects  were  based  on  the  known  pharmacological  activity  of  opioid  agonist 
and/or antagonistic substances.  
The  combination  (4:1)  of  buprenorphine  hydrochloride  and  naloxone  hydrochloride  was  not 
mutagenic in a bacterial mutation assay (Ames test) and was not clastogenic in an in vitro cytogenetic 
assay in human lymphocytes or in an intravenous micronucleus test in the rat. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reproduction  studies  by  oral  administration  of  buprenorphine:  naloxone  (ratio 1:1)  indicated  that 
embryolethality  occurred  in  rats  in  the  presence  of  maternal  toxicity  at  all  doses.  The  lowest  dose 
studied represented exposure multiples of 1x for buprenorphine and 5x for naloxone at the maximum 
human  therapeutic  dose  calculated  on  a  mg/m²  basis.  No  developmental  toxicity  was  observed  in 
rabbits at maternally toxic doses. Further, no teratogenicity has been observed in either rats or rabbits. 
A peri-postnatal study has not been conducted with buprenorphine/naloxone; however, maternal oral 
administration  of  buprenorphine  at  high  doses  during  gestation  and  lactation  resulted  in  difficult 
parturition (possible as a result of the sedative effect of buprenorphine), high neonatal mortality and a 
slight  delay  in  the  development  of  some  neurological  functions  (surface  righting  reflex  and  startle 
response) in neonatal rats. 
Dietary  administration  of  buprenorphine/naloxone  in  the  rat  at  dose  levels  of  500 ppm  or  greater 
produced a reduction in fertility demonstrated by reduced female conception rates. A dietary dose of 
100 ppm  (estimated  exposure  approximately  2.4x  for  buprenorphine  at  a  human  dose  of  24 mg 
buprenorphine/naloxone based on AUC, plasma levels of naloxone were below the limit of detection 
in rats) had no adverse effect on fertility in females. 
A carcinogenicity study with buprenorphine/naloxone was conducted in rats at doses of 7 mg/kg/day, 
30 mg/kg/day and 120 mg/kg/day, with estimated exposure multiples of 3 times to 75 times, based on 
a human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg calculated on a mg/m² basis. Statistically significant increases 
in the incidence of benign testicular interstitial (Leydig's) cell adenomas were observed in all dosage 
groups.

4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Substitution treatment for opioid drug dependence, within a framework of medical, social and 
psychological treatment. The intention of the naloxone component is to deter intravenous misuse. 
Suboxone is indicated in adults and adolescents over 15 years of age who have agreed to be treated for 
addiction. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment must be under the supervision of a physician experienced in the management of opiate 
dependence/addiction. 
Precautions to be taken before induction 
Prior to treatment initiation, consideration should be given to the type of opioid dependence (i.e. long- 
or short-acting opioid), the time since last opioid use and the degree of opioid dependence. To avoid 
precipitating withdrawal, induction with buprenorphine/naloxone or buprenorphine only should be 
undertaken when objective and clear signs of withdrawal are evident (demonstrated by a score 
indicating mild to moderate withdrawal on the validated Clinical Opioid Withdrawal Scale, COWS). 
- 
For patients dependent upon heroin or short-acting opioids, the first dose of 
buprenorphine/naloxone must be taken when signs of withdrawal appear, but not less than 
6 hours after the patient last used opioids. 
For patients receiving methadone, the dose of methadone must be reduced to a maximum of 
30 mg/day before beginning buprenorphine/naloxone therapy. The long half-life of methadone 
should be considered when starting buprenorphine/naloxone. The first dose of 
buprenorphine/naloxone should be taken only when signs of withdrawal appear, but not less 
than 24 hours after the patient last used methadone. Buprenorphine may precipitate symptoms 
of withdrawal in patients dependent upon methadone. 
- 
Posology 
Initiation therapy (induction) 
The recommended starting dose in adults and adolescents over 15 years of age is 4 mg/1 mg and can be 
repeated up to a maximum dose of 12 mg/ 3 mg on day 1 to minimise undue withdrawal symptoms and 
retain the patient in treatment. 
Due to naloxone exposure being somewhat higher following buccal administration than sublingual 
administration, it is recommended that the sublingual site of administration be used during induction to 
minimise naloxone exposure and to reduce the risk of precipitated withdrawal. 
During the initiation of treatment, daily supervision of dosing is recommended to ensure proper sublingual 
placement of the dose and to observe patient response to treatment as a guide to effective dose titration 
according to clinical effect. 
Dosage stabilisation and maintenance therapy 
Following treatment induction on day 1, the patient must be rapidly stabilised on an adequate 
maintenance dose by titrating to achieve a dose that holds the patient in treatment and suppresses 
opioid withdrawal effects and is guided by reassessment of the clinical and psychological status of the 
patient. The maximum single daily dose should not exceed 24 mg buprenorphine. 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During maintenance therapy, it may be necessary to periodically restabilise the patient on a new 
maintenance dose in response to changing patient needs. 
Less than daily dosing 
After a satisfactory stabilisation has been achieved the frequency of Suboxone dosing may be 
decreased to dosing every other day at twice the individually titrated daily dose. For example, a patient 
stabilised to receive a daily dose of 8 mg/2 mg may be given 16 mg/4 mg on alternate days, with no 
dose on the intervening days. In some patients, after a satisfactory stabilisation has been achieved, the 
frequency of Suboxone dosing may be decreased to 3 times a week (for example on Monday, 
Wednesday and Friday). The dose on Monday and Wednesday should be twice the individually 
titrated daily dose, and the dose on Friday should be three times the individually titrated daily dose, 
with no dose on the intervening days. However, the dose given on any one day should not exceed 
24 mg. Patients requiring a titrated daily dose > 8 mg/day may not find this regimen adequate. 
Medical withdrawal 
After a satisfactory stabilisation has been achieved, if the patient agrees, the dose may be reduced 
gradually to a lower maintenance dose, in some favourable cases, treatment may be discontinued. The 
availability of the sublingual film in doses of 2 mg/0.5 mg, 4 mg/1 mg and 8 mg/2 mg allows for a 
downward titration of dose. For patients who may require a lower buprenorphine dose, buprenorphine 
0.4 mg sublingual tablets may be used. Patients should be monitored following medical withdrawal 
because of the potential for relapse. 
Switching between sublingual and buccal sites of administration 
The systemic exposure of buprenorphine between buccal and sublingual administration of Suboxone 
film is approximately similar (see section 5.2). Therefore, once induction is complete, patients can 
switch between buccal and sublingual administration without significant risk of under- or overdosing. 
Switching between buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone 
When used sublingually, buprenorphine/naloxone and buprenorphine have similar clinical effects and 
are interchangeable; however, before switching between buprenorphine/naloxone and buprenorphine, 
the prescriber and patient should agree to the change, and the patient should be monitored in case a 
need to readjust the dose occurs. 
Switching between sublingual tablet and film (where applicable) 
Patients being switched between Suboxone sublingual tablets and Suboxone film should be started on 
the same dose as the previously administered medicinal product. However, dose adjustments may be 
necessary when switching between medicinal products. Due to the potentially greater relative 
bioavailability of Suboxone film compared to Suboxone sublingual tablets, patients switching from 
sublingual tablets to film should be monitored for overdose. Those switching from film to sublingual 
tablets should be monitored for withdrawal or other indications of underdosing. In clinical studies, the 
pharmacokinetics of Suboxone film were not consistently shown to be similar to the respective dosage 
strengths of Suboxone sublingual tablets, as well as to the combinations (see section 5.2). If switching 
between Suboxone film and Suboxone sublingual tablets, the patient should be monitored in case a 
need to readjust the dose occurs. Combining different formulations or alternating between film and 
sublingual tablet formulations is not advised. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
The safety and efficacy of buprenorphine/naloxone in elderly patients over 65 years of age has not 
been established. No recommendation on posology can be made. 
Hepatic impairment 
As buprenorphine/naloxone pharmacokinetics may be altered in patients with hepatic impairment 
lower initial doses and careful dose titration in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment are 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommended. Buprenorphine/naloxone is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
(see sections 4.3 and 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
Modification of the buprenorphine/naloxone dose is not required in patients with renal impairment. 
Caution is recommended when dosing patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance < 30 mL/min) (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of buprenorphine/naloxone in children below the age of 15 years have not 
been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Sublingual use and/or buccal use only.  
For induction buprenorphine/naloxone should be administered sublingually. For maintenance therapy, 
Suboxone film may be administered buccally and/or sublingually.  
The film is not to be swallowed. The film is to be placed under the tongue or inside either cheek until 
completely dissolved. It is advised that patients moisten their mouths prior to dosing. Patients should 
not swallow or consume food or drink until the film is completely dissolved. The film should not be 
moved after placement, and proper administration technique should be demonstrated to the patient.  
For buccal use one film should be placed on the inside of the right or left cheek. If an additional film is 
necessary to achieve the prescribed dose, an additional film should be placed on the opposite side.  
The film must be kept on the inside of the cheek until completely dissolved. If a third film is necessary 
to achieve the prescribed dose, it should be placed on the inside of the right or left cheek after the first 
two films have dissolved.  
For sublingual use one film should be placed under the tongue. If an additional film is necessary to 
achieve the prescribed dose, an additional film should be placed under the tongue on the opposite side. 
The film must be kept under the tongue until completely dissolved. If a third film is necessary to 
achieve the prescribed dose, it should be placed under the tongue after the first two films have 
dissolved.  
A daily dose can be made up from multiple Suboxone films of different strengths.  This may be taken 
all at the same time or in two divided portions.  The second portion should be placed sublingually 
and/or buccally directly after the first portion has dissolved.  
No more than two films should be administered at the same time. It should be ensured that the films do 
not overlap.  
The film is not designed to be split or subdivided into smaller doses.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Misuse, abuse and diversion 
Buprenorphine can be misused or abused in a manner similar to other opioids, legal or illicit. Some 
risks of misuse and abuse include overdose, spread of blood-borne viral or localised and systemic 
infections, respiratory depression and hepatic injury. Buprenorphine misuse by someone other than the 
intended patient poses the additional risk of new drug-dependent individuals using buprenorphine as 
the primary drug of abuse and may occur if the medicinal product is distributed for illicit use directly 
by the intended patient or if it is not safeguarded against theft. 
Suboptimal treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone may prompt misuse by the patient, leading to 
overdose or treatment dropout. A patient who is underdosed with buprenorphine/naloxone may 
continue responding to uncontrolled withdrawal symptoms by self-medicating with opioids, alcohol or 
other sedative-hypnotics such as benzodiazepines. 
To minimise the risk of misuse, abuse and diversion, appropriate precautions should be taken when 
prescribing and dispensing buprenorphine, such as avoiding prescribing multiple refills early in 
treatment, and conducting patient follow-up visits with clinical monitoring that is appropriate for the 
patient’s needs. 
Combining buprenorphine with naloxone in Suboxone is intended to deter misuse and abuse of the 
buprenorphine. Intravenous or intranasal misuse of Suboxone is expected to be less likely than with 
buprenorphine alone since the naloxone in this medicinal product can precipitate withdrawal in 
individual’s dependent on heroin, methadone, or other opioid agonists. 
Sleep-related breathing disorders 
Opioids can cause sleep-related breathing disorders including central sleep apnoea (CSA) and sleep-
related hypoxemia. Opioid use increases the risk of CSA in a dose-dependent fashion. In patients who 
present with CSA, consider decreasing the total opioid dosage. 
Respiratory depression 
A number of cases of death due to respiratory depression have been reported, particularly when 
buprenorphine was used in combination with benzodiazepines (see section 4.5) or when 
buprenorphine was not used according to the prescribing information. Deaths have also been reported 
in association with concomitant administration of buprenorphine and other depressants such as alcohol 
or other opioids. If buprenorphine is administered to some non-opioid dependent individuals, who are 
not tolerant to the effects of opioids, potentially fatal respiratory depression may occur. 
This medicinal product should be used with care in patients with asthma or respiratory insufficiency 
(e.g. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cor pulmonale, decreased respiratory reserve, hypoxia, 
hypercapnia, pre-existing respiratory depression or kyphoscoliosis (curvature of spine leading to 
potential shortness of breath)). 
Buprenorphine/naloxone may cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression in children and non-
dependent persons in case of accidental or deliberate ingestion. Patients must be warned to store the 
sachet safely, to never open the sachet in advance, to keep them out of the reach of children and other 
household members, and not to use this medicinal product in front of children. An emergency unit 
should be contacted immediately in case of accidental ingestion or suspicion of ingestion. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CNS depression 
Buprenorphine/naloxone may cause drowsiness, particularly when taken together with alcohol or 
central nervous system depressants (such as benzodiazepines, tranquilisers, sedatives or hypnotics; see 
sections 4.5 and 4.7). 
Risk from concomitant use of sedative medicinal products such as benzodiazepines or related 
medicinal products 
Concomitant use of buprenorphine/naloxone and sedative medicinal products such as benzodiazepines 
or related medicinal products may result in sedation, respiratory depression, coma and death. Because 
of these risks, concomitant prescribing with these sedative medicinal products should be reserved for 
patients for whom alternative treatment options are not possible. If a decision is made to prescribe 
buprenorphine/naloxone concomitantly with sedative medicinal products, the lowest effective dose of 
the sedative medicines should be used, and the duration of treatment should be as short as possible. 
The patients should be followed closely for signs and symptoms of respiratory depression and 
sedation. In this respect, it is strongly recommended to inform patients and their caregivers to be aware 
of these symptoms (see section 4.5). 
Serotonin syndrome 
Concomitant administration of Suboxone and other serotonergic agents, such as MAO inhibitors, 
selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin norepinephrine re-uptake inhibitors (SNRIs) 
or tricyclic antidepressants may result in serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition 
(see section 4.5). 
If concomitant treatment with other serotonergic agents is clinically warranted, careful observation of 
the patient is advised, particularly during treatment initiation and dose increases. 
Symptoms of serotonin syndrome may include mental-status changes, autonomic instability, 
neuromuscular abnormalities, and/or gastrointestinal symptoms. 
If serotonin syndrome is suspected, a dose reduction or discontinuation of therapy should be 
considered depending on the severity of the symptoms. 
Dependence 
Buprenorphine is a partial agonist at the µ (mu)-opiate receptor and chronic administration produces 
dependence of the opioid type. Studies in animals, as well as clinical experience, have demonstrated 
that buprenorphine may produce dependence, but at a lower level than a full agonist, e.g. morphine. 
Abrupt discontinuation of treatment is not recommended as it may result in a withdrawal syndrome 
that may be delayed in onset. 
Hepatitis and hepatic events 
Cases of acute hepatic injury have been reported in opioid-dependent addicts both in clinical trials and 
in post-marketing adverse reaction reports. The spectrum of abnormalities ranges from transient 
asymptomatic elevations in hepatic transaminases to case reports of hepatic failure, hepatic necrosis, 
hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy and death. In many cases the presence of pre-existing 
mitochondrial impairment (genetic disease, liver enzyme abnormalities, infection with hepatitis B or 
hepatitis C virus, alcohol abuse, anorexia, concomitant use of other potentially hepatotoxic medicinal 
products) and ongoing injecting drug use may have a causative or contributory role. These underlying 
factors must be taken into consideration before prescribing buprenorphine/naloxone and during 
treatment. When a hepatic event is suspected, further biological and aetiological evaluation is required. 
Depending upon the findings, the medicinal product may be discontinued cautiously so as to prevent 
withdrawal symptoms and to prevent a return to illicit drug use. If the treatment is continued, hepatic 
function should be monitored closely. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Precipitation of opioid withdrawal syndrome 
When initiating treatment with buprenorphine/naloxone, the physician must be aware of the partial 
agonist profile of buprenorphine and that it can precipitate withdrawal in opioid-dependent patients, 
particularly if administered less than 6 hours after the last use of heroin or other short-acting opioid, or 
if administered less than 24 hours after the last dose of methadone. Patients should be monitored 
during the switching period from buprenorphine or methadone to buprenorphine/naloxone since 
withdrawal symptoms have been reported. To avoid precipitating withdrawal, induction with 
buprenorphine/naloxone should be undertaken when objective signs of withdrawal are evident (see 
section 4.2). 
Withdrawal symptoms may also be associated with sub-optimal dosing. 
Hepatic impairment 
The effects of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine and naloxone were 
evaluated in a post-marketing study. Both buprenorphine and naloxone are extensively metabolised in 
the liver, and plasma levels were found to be higher for both buprenorphine and naloxone in patients 
with moderate and severe hepatic impairment compared with healthy subjects. Patients should be 
monitored for signs and symptoms of precipitated opioid withdrawal, toxicity or overdose caused by 
increased levels of naloxone and/or buprenorphine. 
Baseline liver function tests and documentation of viral hepatitis status is recommended prior to 
commencing therapy. Patients who are positive for viral hepatitis, on concomitant medicinal products 
(see section 4.5) and/or have existing liver dysfunction are at greater risk of liver injury. Regular 
monitoring of liver function is recommended (see section 4.4). 
Buprenorphine/naloxone should be used with caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment 
(see sections 4.3 and 5.2). In patients with severe hepatic insufficiency the use of 
buprenorphine/naloxone is contraindicated. 
Renal impairment 
Renal elimination may be prolonged since 30 % of the administered dose is eliminated by the renal 
route. Metabolites of buprenorphine accumulate in patients with renal failure. Caution is 
recommended when dosing patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 ml/min) 
(see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
CYP3 A4 inhibitors 
Medicinal products that inhibit the enzyme CYP3A4 may give rise to increased concentrations of 
buprenorphine. A reduction of the buprenorphine/naloxone dose may be needed. Patients already 
treated with CYP3A4 inhibitors should have their dose of buprenorphine/naloxone titrated carefully 
since a reduced dose may be sufficient in these patients (see section 4.5). 
Class effects 
Opioids may produce orthostatic hypotension in ambulatory patients. 
Opioids may elevate cerebrospinal fluid pressure, which may cause seizures, so opioids should be used 
with caution in patients with head injury, intracranial lesions, in other circumstances where 
cerebrospinal pressure may be increased, or in patients with a history of seizure. 
Opioids should be used with caution in patients with hypotension, prostatic hypertrophy or urethral 
stenosis. 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Opioid-induced miosis, changes in the level of consciousness, or changes in the perception of pain as a 
symptom of disease may interfere with patient evaluation or obscure the diagnosis or clinical course of 
concomitant disease. 
Opioids should be used with caution in patients with myxoedema, hypothyroidism, or adrenal cortical 
insufficiency (e.g., Addison's disease). 
Opioids have been shown to increase intracholedochal pressure and should be used with caution in 
patients with dysfunction of the biliary tract. 
Opioids should be administered with caution to elderly or debilitated patients. 
The concomitant use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) might produce an exaggeration of the 
effects of opioids, based on experience with morphine (see section 4.5). 
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains maltitol liquid. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose 
intolerance should not take this medicinal product. 
This medicinal product contains sunset yellow (E 110). Sunset yellow may cause allergic reactions. 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film i.e. essentially “sodium 
free”. 
Paediatric population 
Use in adolescents (age 15 - <18) 
Due to the lack of data in adolescents (age 15 - <18), patients in this age group should be more closely 
monitored during treatment. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Buprenorphine/naloxone should not be taken together with: 
• 
Alcoholic drinks or medicinal products containing alcohol, as alcohol increases the sedative 
effect of buprenorphine (see section 4.7). 
Buprenorphine/naloxone should be used cautiously when co-administered with: 
Sedatives such as benzodiazepines or related medicinal products 
• 
The concomitant use of opioids with sedative medicinal products such as benzodiazepines or 
related medicinal products increases the risk of sedation, respiratory depression, coma and death 
because of additive CNS depressant effect. The dose and duration of concomitant use of 
sedative medicinal products should be limited (see section 4.4). Patients should be warned that 
it is extremely dangerous to self-administer non-prescribed benzodiazepines while taking this 
medicinal product and should also be cautioned to use benzodiazepines concurrently with this 
medicinal product only as directed by their physician (see section 4.4). 
• 
• 
Other central nervous system depressants, other opioid derivatives (e.g. methadone, analgesics 
and antitussives), certain antidepressants, sedative H1-receptor antagonists, barbiturates, 
anxiolytics other than benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, clonidine and related substances: these 
combinations increase central nervous system depression. The reduced level of alertness can 
make driving and using machines hazardous. 
Furthermore, adequate analgesia may be difficult to achieve when administering a full opioid 
agonist in patients receiving buprenorphine/naloxone. Therefore, the potential to overdose with 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a full agonist exists, especially when attempting to overcome buprenorphine partial agonist 
effects, or when buprenorphine plasma levels are declining. 
Serotonergic  medicinal  products,  such  as  MAO  inhibitors,  selective  serotonin  re-uptake 
inhibitors  (SSRIs),  serotonin  norepinephrine  re-uptake 
tricyclic 
antidepressants  as  the  risk  of  serotonin  syndrome,  a  potentially  life-threatening  condition,  is 
increased (see section 4.4). 
inhibitor  (SNRIs)  or 
Naltrexone and nalmefene are opioid antagonists that can block the pharmacological effects of 
buprenorphine. Co-administration during buprenorphine/naloxone treatment is contraindicated 
due to the potentially dangerous interaction that may precipitate a sudden onset of prolonged 
and intense opioid withdrawal symptoms (see section 4.3). 
CYP3A4 inhibitors: an interaction study of buprenorphine with ketoconazole (a potent inhibitor 
of CYP3A4) resulted in increased Cmax and AUC (area under the curve) of buprenorphine 
(approximately 50 % and 70 % respectively) and, to a lesser extent, of norbuprenorphine. 
Patients receiving Suboxone should be closely monitored and may require dose reduction if 
combined with potent CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. protease inhibitors like ritonavir, nelfinavir or 
indinavir or azole antifungals such as ketoconazole or itraconazole, macrolide antibiotics). 
CYP3A4 inducers: Concomitant use of CYP3A4 inducers with buprenorphine may decrease 
buprenorphine plasma concentrations, potentially resulting in sub-optimal treatment of opioid 
dependence with buprenorphine. It is recommended that patients receiving 
buprenorphine/naloxone should be closely monitored if inducers (e.g. phenobarbital, 
carbamazepine, phenytoin, rifampicin) are co-administered. The dose of buprenorphine or the 
CYP3A4 inducer may need to be adjusted accordingly. 
The concomitant use of MAOI might produce exaggeration of the effects of opioids, based on 
experience with morphine.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of buprenorphine/naloxone in pregnant women. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is 
unknown. 
Towards the end of pregnancy buprenorphine may induce respiratory depression in the newborn infant 
even after a short period of administration. Long-term administration of buprenorphine during the last 
three months of pregnancy may cause a withdrawal syndrome in the neonate (e.g. hypertonia, neonatal 
tremor, neonatal agitation, myoclonus or convulsions). The syndrome is generally delayed from 
several hours to several days after birth. 
Due to the long half-life of buprenorphine, neonatal monitoring for several days should be considered 
at the end of pregnancy, to prevent the risk of respiratory depression or withdrawal syndrome in 
neonates. 
Furthermore, the use of buprenorphine/naloxone during pregnancy should be assessed by the 
physician. Buprenorphine/naloxone should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit 
outweighs the potential risk to the fetus. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether naloxone is excreted in human milk. Buprenorphine and its metabolites are 
excreted in human milk. In rat’s buprenorphine has been found to inhibit lactation. Therefore, 
breastfeeding should be discontinued during treatment with Suboxone. 
Fertility 
Animal studies have shown a reduction in female fertility at high doses (systemic exposure > 2.4 times 
the human exposure at the maximum recommended dose of 24 mg buprenorphine, based on AUC; see 
section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Buprenorphine/naloxone has minor to moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines 
when administered to opioid-dependent patients. This medicinal product may cause drowsiness, 
dizziness, or impaired thinking, especially during treatment induction and dose adjustment. If taken 
together with alcohol or central nervous system depressants, the effect is likely to be more pronounced 
(see sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Patients should be cautioned about driving or operating hazardous machinery in case 
buprenorphine/naloxone may adversely affect their ability to engage in such activities. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse reactions reported during the pivotal clinical 
studies were constipation and symptoms commonly associated with drug withdrawal (i.e. insomnia, 
headache, nausea, hyperhidrosis and pain). Some reports of seizure, vomiting, diarrhoea, and elevated 
liver function tests were considered serious. 
The most commonly reported treatment-related adverse reactions associated with the sublingual or 
buccal administration of buprenorphine/naloxone were oral hypoesthesia and oral mucosal erythema, 
respectively. Other treatment-related adverse reactions reported by more than one patient were 
constipation, glossodynia and vomiting.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
In cases of intravenous drug misuse, some adverse reactions are attributed to the act of misuse rather 
than the medicinal product and include local reactions, sometimes septic (abscess, cellulitis), and 
potentially serious acute hepatitis, and other infections such as pneumonia, endocarditis have been 
reported (see section 4.4). 
In patients presenting with marked drug dependence, initial administration of buprenorphine can 
produce a drug withdrawal syndrome similar to that associated with naloxone (see sections 4.2 and 
4.4).

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
Respiratory depression as a result of central nervous system depression is the primary symptom 
requiring intervention in the case of overdose because it may lead to respiratory arrest and death. Signs 
of overdose may also include somnolence, amblyopia, miosis, hypotension, nausea, vomiting and/or 
speech disorders. 
Management 
General supportive measures should be instituted, including close monitoring of respiratory and 
cardiac status of the patient. Symptomatic treatment of respiratory depression and standard intensive 
care measures should be implemented. A patent airway and assisted or controlled ventilation must be 
assured. The patient should be transferred to an environment within which full resuscitation facilities 
are available. 
If the patient vomits, care must be taken to prevent aspiration of the vomitus. 
Use of an opioid antagonist (i.e., naloxone) is recommended, despite the modest effect it may have in 
reversing the respiratory symptoms of buprenorphine compared with its effects on full agonist opioid 
agents. 
If naloxone is used, the long duration of action of buprenorphine should be taken into consideration 
when determining the length of treatment and medical surveillance needed to reverse the effects of an 
overdose. Naloxone can be cleared more rapidly than buprenorphine, allowing for a return of 
previously controlled buprenorphine overdose symptoms, so a continuing infusion may be necessary. 
If infusion is not possible, repeated dosing with naloxone may be required. Ongoing intravenous 
infusion rates should be titrated to patient response.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other nervous system drugs, drugs used in addictive disorders, ATC 
code: N07BC51. 
Mechanism of action 
Buprenorphine is an opioid partial agonist/antagonist which binds to the μ and κ (kappa) opioid 
receptors of the brain. Its activity in opioid maintenance treatment is attributed to its slowly reversible 
properties with the μ-opioid receptors which, over a prolonged period, might minimise the need of 
addicted patients for drugs. 
Opioid agonist ceiling effects were observed during clinical pharmacology studies in opioid-dependent 
persons. 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Naloxone is an antagonist at μ-opioid receptors. When administered orally or sublingually in usual 
doses to patients experiencing opioid withdrawal, naloxone exhibits little or no pharmacological effect 
because of its almost complete first pass metabolism. However, when administered intravenously to 
opioid-dependent persons, the presence of naloxone in Suboxone produces marked opioid antagonist 
effects and opioid withdrawal, thereby deterring intravenous abuse. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Efficacy and safety data for buprenorphine/naloxone are primarily derived from a one-year clinical 
trial, comprising a 4-week randomised double blind comparison of buprenorphine/naloxone, 
buprenorphine and placebo followed by a 48-week safety study of buprenorphine/naloxone. In this 
trial, 326 heroin-addicted subjects were randomly assigned to either buprenorphine/naloxone 16 mg 
per day, 16 mg buprenorphine per day or placebo. For subjects randomized to either active treatment, 
dosing began with 8 mg of buprenorphine on Day 1, followed by 16 mg (two 8 mg) of buprenorphine 
on Day 2. On Day 3, those randomized to receive buprenorphine/naloxone were switched to the 
combination tablet. Subjects were seen daily in the clinic (Monday through Friday) for dosing and 
efficacy assessments. Take-home doses were provided for weekends. The primary study comparison 
was to assess the efficacy of buprenorphine and buprenorphine/naloxone individually against placebo. 
The percentage of thrice-weekly urine samples that were negative for non-study opioids was 
statistically higher for both buprenorphine/naloxone versus placebo (p < 0.0001) and buprenorphine 
versus placebo (p < 0.0001). 
In a double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study comparing buprenorphine ethanolic solution 
versus a full agonist active control, 162 subjects were randomized to receive the ethanolic sublingual 
solution of buprenorphine at 8 mg/day (a dose which is roughly comparable to a dose of 12 mg/day of 
buprenorphine/naloxone), or two relatively low doses of active control, one of which was low enough 
to serve as an alternative to placebo, during a 3 to10 day induction phase, a 16-week maintenance 
phase and a 7-week detoxification phase. Buprenorphine was titrated to maintenance dose by Day 3; 
active control doses were titrated more gradually. Based on retention in treatment and the percentage 
of thrice-weekly urine samples negative for non-study opioids, buprenorphine was more effective than 
the low dose of the control in keeping heroin addicts in treatment and in reducing their use of opioids 
while in treatment. The effectiveness of buprenorphine, 8 mg per day was similar to that of the 
moderate active control dose, but equivalence was not demonstrated. 
In a multicentre RCT study, 92 patients received either Suboxone film or Suboxone sublingual tablets 
following a 7-day run-in period with Suboxone sublingual tablets. It took 4 minutes on average for the 
sublingual tablets to visibly dissolve and 3 minutes on average for the sublingual film to dissolve. As 
concerns removability of sublingually applied films it was demonstrated that after 30 seconds of the 
application of a single film, none of the study participants could remove some or all the film. 
However, when 2 or more films were administered the participants were more likely to be able to 
remove some or all the film after 30 seconds. No more than 2 films should be administered at the same 
time (see section 4.2). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Buprenorphine 
Absorption 
Buprenorphine, when taken orally, undergoes first-pass metabolism with N-dealkylation and 
glucuroconjugation in the small intestine and the liver. The use of this medicinal product by the oral 
route is therefore inappropriate. 
Plasma levels of buprenorphine increased with increasing sublingual dose of buprenorphine/naloxone. 
There was wide inter-patient variability in buprenorphine plasma levels, but within subjects the 
variability was low.

Distribution 
The absorption of buprenorphine is followed by a rapid distribution phase (distribution half-life of 2 to 
5 hours). 
Buprenorphine is highly lipophilic, which leads to rapid penetration of the blood-brain barrier. 
Buprenorphine is approximately 96 % protein bound, primarily to alpha and beta globulin. 
Biotransformation 
Buprenorphine is primarily metabolised through N-dealkylation by liver microsomal CYP3A4. The 
parent molecule and the primary dealkylated metabolite, norbuprenorphine, undergo subsequent 
glucuronidation. Norbuprenorphine binds to opioid receptors in vitro; however, it is not known 
whether norbuprenorphine contributes to the overall effect of buprenorphine/naloxone. 
Elimination 
Elimination of buprenorphine is bi- or tri-exponential, and the mean terminal elimination half-life 
from plasma is reported in Table 2. 
Buprenorphine is excreted in the faeces (~70 %) by biliary excretion of the glucuroconjugated 
metabolites, the rest (~30 %) being excreted in the urine. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Buprenorphine Cmax and AUC increased in a linear fashion with the increasing dose (in the range of 4 
to 16 mg), although the increase was not directly dose-proportional. 
Naloxone 
Absorption 
Naloxone mean peak plasma concentrations were too low to assess dose-proportionality, and in seven 
of eight subjects tested who had naloxone plasma levels above the limit of quantification 
(0.05 ng/mL), naloxone was not detected beyond 2 hours post-dose. 
Naloxone has not been found to affect the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine, and both 
buprenorphine sublingual tablets and buprenorphine/naloxone sublingual film deliver similar plasma 
concentrations of buprenorphine. 
Distribution 
Naloxone is approximately 45 % protein bound, primarily to albumin. 
Biotransformation 
Naloxone is metabolized in the liver, primarily by glucuronide conjugation, and excreted in the urine. 
Naloxone undergoes direct glucuronidation to naloxone 3-glucuronide, as well as N-dealkylation and 
reduction of the 6-oxo group. 
Elimination 
Naloxone is excreted in the urine, with a mean half-life of elimination from plasma ranging from 2 to 
12 hours. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No pharmacokinetic data in elderly patients are available. 
Renal impairment 
Renal elimination plays a relatively small role (~30 %) in the overall clearance of 
buprenorphine/naloxone. No dose modification based on renal function is required but caution is 
recommended when dosing subjects with severe renal impairment (see section 4.3). 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatic impairment 
The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of buprenorphine were evaluated in a post-
marketing study. Table 4 summarises the results from a clinical trial in which the exposure of 
buprenorphine and naloxone was determined after administering a buprenorphine/naloxone 2.0/0.5 mg 
sublingual tablet in healthy subjects, and in subjects with varied degrees of hepatic impairment.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
The combination of buprenorphine and naloxone has been investigated in acute and repeated dose (up 
to 90 days in rats) toxicity studies in animals. No synergistic enhancement of toxicity has been 
observed. Undesirable effects were based on the known pharmacological activity of opioid agonist 
and/or antagonistic substances. 
The combination (4:1) of buprenorphine hydrochloride and naloxone hydrochloride was not 
mutagenic in a bacterial mutation assay (Ames test) and was not clastogenic in an in vitro cytogenetic 
assay in human lymphocytes or in an intravenous micronucleus test in the rat. 
Reproduction studies by oral administration of buprenorphine: naloxone (ratio 1:1) indicated that 
embryolethality occurred in rats in the presence of maternal toxicity at all doses. The lowest dose 
studied represented exposure multiples of 1 × for buprenorphine and 5 × for naloxone at the maximum 
human therapeutic dose calculated on a mg/m2 basis. No developmental toxicity was observed in 
rabbits at maternally toxic doses. Further, no teratogenicity has been observed in either rats or rabbits. 
A peri-postnatal study has not been conducted with buprenorphine/naloxone; however, maternal oral 
administration of buprenorphine at high doses during gestation and lactation resulted in difficult 
parturition (possible as a result of the sedative effect of buprenorphine), high neonatal mortality and a 
slight delay in the development of some neurological functions (surface righting reflex and startle 
response) in neonatal rats. 
Dietary administration of buprenorphine/naloxone in the rat at dose levels of 500 ppm or greater 
produced a reduction in fertility demonstrated by reduced female conception rates. A dietary dose of 
100 ppm (estimated exposure approximately 2.4 × for buprenorphine at a human dose of 24 mg 
buprenorphine/naloxone based on AUC, plasma levels of naloxone were below the limit of detection 
in rats) had no adverse effect on fertility in females. 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A carcinogenicity study with buprenorphine/naloxone was conducted in rats at doses of 7 mg/kg/day, 
30 mg/kg/day and 120 mg/kg/day, with estimated exposure multiples of 3 times to 75 times, based on 
a human daily sublingual dose of 16 mg calculated on a mg/m2 basis. Statistically significant increases 
in the incidence of benign testicular interstitial (Leydig's) cell adenomas were observed in all dosage 
groups.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Suboxone is and what it is used for 
Suboxone is used to treat dependence on opioid (narcotic) drugs such as heroin or morphine in drug 
addicts who have agreed to be treated for their addiction. Suboxone is used in adults and adolescents 
over 15 years of age, who are also receiving medical, social and psychological support. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Suboxone

(listed in section 6) 
if you have serious breathing problems 
if you have serious problems with your liver 
if you are intoxicated due to alcohol or have trembling, sweating, anxiety, confusion, or 
hallucinations caused by alcohol.  
if you are taking naltrexone or nalmefene for the treatment of alcohol or opioid dependence. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor before taking Suboxone if you have: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
asthma or other breathing problems 
problems with your liver such as hepatitis 
low blood pressure 
recently suffered a head injury or brain disease 
a urinary disorder (especially linked to enlarged prostrate in men) 
64 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
any kidney disease 
thyroid problems 
adrenocortical disorder (e.g. Addison’s disease) 
depression or other conditions that are treated with antidepressants. The use of these medicines 
together with Suboxone can lead to serotonin syndrome, a potentially life-threatening condition 
(see ‘’Other medicines and Suboxone’’). 
Important things to be aware of: 
• 
• 
An emergency unit should be contacted immediately in case of accidental ingestion or suspicion 
of ingestion. 
Additional monitoring  
You may be more closely monitored by your doctor if you are over the age of 65.  
•  Misuse and abuse  
This medicine can be a target for people who abuse prescription medicines and should be kept 
in a safe place to protect it from theft (see section 5). Do not give this medicine to anyone else. 
It can cause death or otherwise harm them. 
• 
• 
• 
Breathing problems 
Some people have died from respiratory failure (inability to breathe) because they misused 
buprenorphine or have taken it in combination with other central nervous system depressants, 
such as alcohol, benzodiazepines (tranquilisers), or other opioids.  
This medicine may cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression (reduced ability to 
breathe) in children and non-dependent people who accidentally or deliberately take it. 
Sleep-related breathing disorders  
Suboxone can cause sleep-related breathing disorders such as sleep apnoea (breathing pauses 
during sleep) and sleep related hypoxemia (low oxygen level in the blood). The symptoms can 
include breathing pauses during sleep, night awakening due to shortness of breath, difficulties to 
maintain sleep or excessive drowsiness during the day. If you or another person observe these 
symptoms, contact your doctor. A dose reduction may be considered by your doctor.  
Dependence 
This medicine can cause dependence.  
•  Withdrawal symptoms 
This medicine can cause opioid withdrawal symptoms if you take it too soon after taking 
opioids. You should leave at least 6 hours after you use a short-acting opioid (e.g. morphine, 
heroin) or at least 24 hours after you use a long-acting opioid such as methadone. 
This medicine can also cause withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking it abruptly. See section 3 
‘stopping treatment’. 
• 
Liver damage 
Liver damage has been reported after taking Suboxone, especially when the medicine is 
misused. This could also be due to viral infections (e.g. chronic hepatitis C), alcohol abuse, 
anorexia or use of other medicines with the ability to harm your liver (see section 4). Regular 
blood tests may be conducted by your doctor to monitor the condition of your liver. Tell 
your doctor if you have any liver problems before you start treatment with Suboxone. 
65 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
Blood pressure 
This medicine may cause your blood pressure to drop suddenly, causing you to feel dizzy if you 
get up too quickly from sitting or lying down. 
Diagnosis of unrelated medical conditions 
This medicine may mask pain symptoms that could assist in the diagnosis of some diseases. 
You must tell your doctor that you take this medicine. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children under the age of 15. If you are between 15 and 18 years old 
your doctor may monitor you more closely during treatment, because of the lack of data in this age 
group. 
Other medicines and Suboxone 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Some medicines may increase the side effects of Suboxone, these can be serious. Do not take any 
other medicines whilst taking Suboxone without first talking to your doctor, especially: 
• 
• 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Benzodiazepines (used to treat anxiety or sleep disorders) such as diazepam, temazepam, 
alprazolam. Concomitant use of Suboxone and sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines or 
related drugs increases the risk of drowsiness, difficulties in breathing (respiratory depression), 
coma and may be life-threatening. Because of this, concomitant use should only be considered 
when other treatment options are not possible. However if your doctor does prescribe Suboxone 
together with sedative medicines the dose and duration of concomitant treatment should be 
limited by your doctor. Please tell your doctor about all sedative medicines you are taking, and 
follow your doctor’s dose recommendation closely. It could be helpful to inform friends or 
relatives to be aware of the signs and symptoms stated above. Contact your doctor when 
experiencing such symptoms.  
Other medicines that may make you feel sleepy which are used to treat illnesses such as 
anxiety, sleeplessness, convulsions/seizures, pain. These types of medicines may reduce your 
alertness levels making it difficult for you to drive and use machines. They may also cause 
central nervous system depression, which is very serious. Below is a list of examples of these 
types of medicines: 
Other opioid containing medicines such as methadone, certain painkillers and cough 
suppressants 
Antidepressants (used to treat depression) such as isocarboxazid, phenelzine, selegiline, 
tranylcypromine and valproate may increase the effects of this medicine. 
Sedative Hı receptor antagonists (used to treat allergic reactions) such as diphenhydramine and 
chlorphenamine. 
Barbiturates (used to cause sleep or sedation) such as phenobarbital, secobarbital 
Tranquilisers (used to cause sleep or sedation) such as chloral hydrate. 
•  Anti-depressants such as moclobemide, tranylcypromine, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, 
fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, venlafaxine, amitriptyline, doxepine, or 
trimipramine. These medicines may interact with Suboxone and you may experience symptoms 
such as involuntary, rhythmic contractions of muscles, including the muscles, that control 
movement of the eye, agitation, hallucinations, coma, excessive sweating, tremor, exaggeration of 
reflexes, increased muscle tension, body temperature above 38°C. Contact your doctor when 
experiencing such symptoms. 
• 
• 
Clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure) may extend the effects of this medicine. 
Anti-retrovirals (used to treat HIV) such as ritonavir, nelfinavir, indinavir may increase the 
effects of this medicine.

Some antifungal agents (used to treat fungal infections) such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
certain antibiotics, may extend the effects of this medicine. 
Some medicines may decrease the effect of Suboxone. These include medicines used to treat 
epilepsy (such as carbamazepine and phenytoin), and medicines used to treat tuberculosis 
(rifampicin). 
Naltrexone and nalmefene (medicines used to treat addictive disorders) may prevent the 
therapeutic effects of Suboxone. They should not be taken at the same time as Suboxone 
treatment because you may experience a sudden onset of prolonged and intense withdrawal. 
Suboxone with food, drink and alcohol 
Do not have alcohol whilst being treated with this medicine. Alcohol may increase drowsiness and 
may increase the risk of respiratory failure if taken with Suboxone. Do not swallow or consume food 
or any drink until the tablet is completely dissolved.  
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. The risks of using Suboxone in pregnant women 
are not known. Your doctor will decide if your treatment should be continued with an alternative 
medicine. 
When taken during pregnancy, particularly late pregnancy, medicines like Suboxone may cause drug 
withdrawal symptoms including problems with breathing in your newborn baby. This may appear 
several days after birth. 
Do not breast-feed whilst taking this medicine, as buprenorphine passes into breast milk. 
Driving and using machines 
Do not drive, cycle, use any tools or machines, or perform dangerous activities until you know how 
this medicine affects you. Suboxone may cause drowsiness, dizziness or impair your thinking. This 
may happen more often in the first few weeks of treatment when your dose is being changed, but it can 
also happen if you drink alcohol or take other sedative medicines at the same time as when you take 
Suboxone. 
Suboxone contains lactose and sodium. 
This medicine contains lactose. If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to 
some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) tablet, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How to take Suboxone 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Your treatment is prescribed and monitored by doctors who are experienced in the treatment of drug 
dependence.  
Your doctor will determine the best dose for you. During your treatment, the doctor may adjust the

doctor will tell you when to take your first dose. 
• 
• 
Starting treatment of Suboxone whilst dependent on heroin 
If you are dependent upon heroin or a short acting opioid, your first dose should be taken when 
signs of withdrawal appear, at least 6 hours after you last used opioids. 
Starting treatment of Suboxone whilst dependent on methadone 
If you have been taking methadone or a long acting opioid, the dose of methadone should 
ideally be reduced to below 30 mg/day before beginning Suboxone therapy. The first dose of 
Suboxone should be taken when signs of withdrawal appear, and at least 24 hours after you 
last used methadone.  
Taking Suboxone 
• 
• 
• 
Take the dose once a day by placing the tablets under the tongue.

Dose adjustment and maintenance therapy: 
During the days after you start treatment, your doctor may increase the dose of Suboxone you take 
according to your needs. If you think that the effect of Suboxone is too strong or too weak, talk to your 
doctor or pharmacist. The maximum daily dose is 24 mg buprenorphine. 
After a time of successful treatment, you may agree with your doctor to reduce the dose gradually to a 
lower maintenance dose. 
Stopping treatment 
Depending on your condition, the dose of Suboxone may continue to be reduced under careful medical 
supervision, until eventually it may be stopped. 
Do not change the treatment in any way or stop treatment without the agreement of the doctor who is 
treating you. 
If you take more Suboxone than you should 
If you or someone else takes too much of this medicine, you must go or be taken immediately to an 
emergency centre or hospital for treatment as overdose with Suboxone may cause serious and life-
threatening breathing problems.

vision, and/or slurred speech. You may be unable to think clearly, and may breathe much slower than 
is normal for you. 
If you forget to take Suboxone 
Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you miss a dose. 
If you stop taking Suboxone 
Do not change the treatment in any way or stop treatment without the agreement of the doctor who is 
treating you. Stopping treatment suddenly may cause withdrawal symptoms.

(see ‘’Other medicines and Suboxone’’). 
Important things to be aware of: 
• 
 An emergency unit should be contacted immediately in case of accidental ingestion or 
suspicion of ingestion. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Additional monitoring 
You may be more closely monitored by your doctor if you are over the age of 65. . 
Misuse and abuse 
This medicine can be a target for people who abuse prescription medicines and should be kept 
in a safe place to protect it from theft (see section 5). Do not give this medicine to anyone else. 
It can cause death or otherwise harm them. 
Breathing problems 
Some people have died from respiratory failure (inability to breathe) because they misused 
buprenorphine or have taken it in combination with other central nervous system depressants, 
such as alcohol, benzodiazepines (tranquilisers), or other opioids. 
This medicine may cause severe, possibly fatal, respiratory depression (reduced ability to 
breathe) in children and non-dependent people who accidentally or deliberately take it. 
Sleep-related breathing disorders  
Suboxone can cause sleep-related breathing disorders such as sleep apnoea (breathing pauses 
during sleep) and sleep related hypoxemia (low oxygen level in the blood). The symptoms can 
include breathing pauses during sleep, night awakening due to shortness of breath, difficulties to 
maintain sleep or excessive drowsiness during the day. If you or another person observe these 
symptoms, contact your doctor. A dose reduction may be considered by your doctor.  
Dependence 
This medicine can cause dependence. 
•  Withdrawal symptoms 
This medicine can cause opioid withdrawal symptoms if you take it too soon after taking 
opioids. You should leave at least 6 hours after you use a short-acting opioid (e.g. morphine, 
heroin) or at least 24 hours after you use a long-acting opioid such as methadone. 
This medicine can also cause withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking it abruptly. See section 3 
‘stopping treatment’. 
• 
Liver damage 
Liver damage has been reported after taking Suboxone, especially when the medicine is 
misused. This could also be due to viral infections (e.g. chronic hepatitis C), alcohol abuse, 
anorexia or use of other medicines with the ability to harm your liver (see section 4). Regular 
blood tests may be conducted by your doctor to monitor the condition of your liver. Tell 
your doctor if you have any liver problems before you start treatment with Suboxone. 
75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
Blood pressure 
This medicine may cause your blood pressure to drop suddenly, causing you to feel dizzy if you 
get up too quickly from sitting or lying down. 
• 
Diagnosis of unrelated medical conditions 
This medicine may mask pain symptoms that could assist in the diagnosis of some diseases. 
You must tell your doctor that you take this medicine. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children under the age of 15. If you are between 15 and 18 years old 
your doctor may monitor you more closely during treatment, because of the lack of data in this age 
group. 
Other medicines and Suboxone 
Tell your doctor if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
Some medicines may increase the side effects of Suboxone, and these can be serious. Do not take any 
other medicines whilst taking Suboxone without first talking to your doctor, especially: 
• 
• 
• 
Benzodiazepines (used to treat anxiety or sleep disorders) such as diazepam, temazepam, or 
alprazolam. Concomitant use of Suboxone and sedative medicines such as benzodiazepines or 
related medicines increases the risk of drowsiness, difficulties in breathing (respiratory 
depression), coma and may be life-threatening. Because of this, concomitant use should only be 
considered when other treatment options are not possible. 
However if your doctor does prescribe Suboxone together with sedative medicines the dose and 
duration of concomitant treatment should be limited by your doctor. 
Please tell your doctor about all sedative medicines you are taking, and follow your doctor’s 
dose recommendation closely. It could be helpful to inform friends or relatives to be aware of 
the signs and symptoms stated above. Contact your doctor when experiencing such symptoms.  
Other medicines that may make you feel sleepy which are used to treat illnesses such as 
anxiety, sleeplessness, convulsions/seizures, pain. These types of medicines may reduce your 
alertness levels making it difficult for you to drive and use machines. They may also cause 
central nervous system depression, which is very serious. Below is a list of examples of these 
types of medicines: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Other opioid containing medicines such as methadone, certain painkillers and cough 
suppressants. 
Antidepressants (used to treat depression) such as isocarboxazid, phenelzine, selegiline, 
tranylcypromine and valproate may increase the effects of this medicine. 
Sedative H1 receptor antagonists (used to treat allergic reactions) such as 
diphenhydramine and chlorphenamine. 
Barbiturates (used to cause sleep or sedation) such as phenobarbital, secobarbital. 
Tranquilisers (used to cause sleep or sedation) such as chloral hydrate. 
Anti-depressants such as moclobemide, tranylcypromine, citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, 
fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, duloxetine, venlafaxine, amitriptyline, doxepine, or 
trimipramine. These medicines may interact with Suboxone and you may experience symptoms 
such as involuntary, rhythmic contractions of muscles, including the muscles, that control 
movement of the eye, agitation, hallucinations, coma, excessive sweating, tremor, exaggeration 
of reflexes, increased muscle tension, body temperature above 38°C. Contact your doctor when 
experiencing such symptoms. 
• 
Clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure) may extend the effects of this medicine. 
76 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
Antiretrovirals (used to treat HIV) such as ritonavir, nelfinavir, indinavir may increase the 
effects of this medicine. 
Some antifungal agents (used to treat fungal infections) such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, 
certain antibiotics, may extend the effects of this medicine. Some medicines may decrease the 
effect of Suboxone. These include medicines used to treat epilepsy (such as carbamazepine and 
phenytoin), and medicines used to treat tuberculosis (rifampicin). 
Naltrexone and nalmefene (medicines used to treat addictive disorders) may prevent the 
therapeutic effects of Suboxone. They should not be taken at the same time as Suboxone 
treatment because you may experience a sudden onset of prolonged and intense withdrawal. 
Suboxone with food, drink and alcohol 
Do not have alcohol whilst being treated with this medicine. Alcohol may increase drowsiness and 
may increase the risk of respiratory failure if taken with Suboxone. Do not swallow or consume food 
or any drink until the film is completely dissolved. 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
Tell your doctor if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby. The 
risks of using Suboxone in pregnant women are not known. Your doctor will decide if your treatment 
should be continued with an alternative medicine. 
When taken during pregnancy, particularly late pregnancy, medicines like Suboxone may cause drug 
withdrawal symptoms including problems with breathing in your newborn baby. This may appear 
several days after birth. 
Do not breast-feed whilst taking this medicine, as buprenorphine passes into breast milk. 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
Do not drive, cycle, use any tools or machines, or perform dangerous activities until you know how 
this medicine affects you. Suboxone may cause drowsiness, dizziness or impair your thinking. This 
may happen more often in the first few weeks of treatment when your dose is being changed, but it can 
also happen if you drink alcohol or take other sedative medicines at the same time as when you take 
Suboxone. 
Suboxone contains maltitol, sunset yellow (E110) and sodium. 
Suboxone contains maltitol liquid. If you have been told by your doctor that you have intolerance to 
some sugars, contact your doctor before taking this medicine. 
Suboxone contains sunset yellow (E110), which may cause allergic reactions. 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per film, that is to say essentially ‘sodium 
free’. 
3. 
How to take Suboxone 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
Your treatment is prescribed and monitored by doctors who are experienced in the treatment of drug 
dependence. 
Your doctor will determine the best dose for you. During your treatment, the doctor may adjust the 
dose, depending upon your response to treatment. 
77 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Starting treatment 
The recommended starting dose for adults and adolescents over the age of 15 years is usually two 
Suboxone 2 mg/0.5 mg sublingual films, or one Suboxone 4 mg/1 mg sublingual film. 
This dose may be repeated up to twice on day 1 depending on your needs. 
You should be aware of the clear signs of withdrawal before taking your first dose of Suboxone. Your 
doctor will tell you when to take your first dose. 
• 
Starting treatment of Suboxone whilst dependent on heroin 
If you are dependent upon heroin or a short-acting opioid, your first dose should be taken when 
signs of withdrawal appear, at least 6 hours after you last used opioids. 
• 
Starting treatment of Suboxone whilst dependent on methadone 
If you have been taking methadone or a long acting opioid, the dose of methadone should 
ideally be reduced to below 30 mg/day before beginning Suboxone therapy. The first dose of 
Suboxone should be taken when signs of withdrawal appear, and at least 24 hours after you 
last used methadone. 
Dose adjustment and maintenance therapy: During the days after you start treatment, your doctor 
may increase the dose of Suboxone you take according to your needs. If you think that the effect of 
Suboxone is too strong or too weak, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. The maximum daily dose is 
24 mg buprenorphine. 
After a time of successful treatment, you may agree with your doctor to reduce the dose gradually to a 
lower maintenance dose. 
Taking Suboxone 
• 
• 
• 
Take the dose once a day, at approximately the same time. 
It is advisable to moisten your mouth before taking the film. 
Place the sublingual film under the tongue (sublingual use) or on the inside of the cheek (buccal 
use) as advised by your doctor. Ensure the films do not overlap. 
Keep the films in place under the tongue, or inside of the cheek, until they have completely 
dissolved. 
Do not chew or swallow the film, as the medicine will not work, and you may get withdrawal 
symptoms. 
Do not consume any food or drink until the film has completely dissolved. 
Do not split the film or subdivide into smaller doses.

How to remove the film from the sachet 
Each Suboxone film comes in a sealed child‐resistant sachet. Do not open the sachet until you are 
ready to use it. 
To open the sachet, find the dotted line that runs along the top edge of the sachet and fold the edge of 
the sachet along the dotted line (see Figure 1). 
78 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 1 
• 
• 
Folding the sachet along the dotted line exposes a slit through the folded edge of the sachet that 
can then be torn in the direction of the arrow. 
Alternatively, the sachet may be cut with scissors along the arrow (see Figure 2). 
Figure 2 
If the sachet is damaged, discard the film. 
How to place a film under your tongue (sublingual use): 
Drink water to moisten your mouth first. This helps the film dissolve more easily. Then, hold a film 
between two fingers by the outside edges, and place the film under your tongue, close to the base 
either to the left or right (see Figure 3). 
Figure 3 
If your doctor tells you to take two films at a time, place the second film under your tongue on the 
79 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
opposite side. Ensure the films do not overlap 
If your doctor tells you to take a third film, place it under your tongue on either side after the first two 
films have dissolved. 
How to place a film on the inside of your cheek (buccal use): 
Drink water to moisten your mouth. Hold the film between two fingers by the outside edges and place 
one film on the inside of your right or left cheek (see Figure 4). 
Figure 4 
If your doctor tells you to take two films at a time, place the other film on the inside of the opposite 
cheek: and this will ensure that the films do not overlap. If your doctor tells you to take a third film, 
place it on the inside of your right or left cheek after the first two films have dissolved. 
If you take more Suboxone than you should 
Seek urgent medical attention if you or someone else takes too much of this medicine. 
Overdose with Suboxone may cause serious and life-threatening breathing problems. 
Symptoms of overdose may include feeling sleepy and uncoordinated with slowed reflexes, blurred 
vision, and/or slurred speech. You may be unable to think clearly and may breathe much slower than 
is normal for you. 
If you forget to take Suboxone 
Tell your doctor as soon as possible if you miss a dose. 
If you stop taking Suboxone 
Stopping treatment suddenly may cause withdrawal symptoms. Depending on your condition, the 
dose of Suboxone may continue to be reduced under careful medical supervision, until eventually it 
may be stopped. Do not change the treatment in any way or stop treatment without the agreement of 
the doctor who is treating you. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

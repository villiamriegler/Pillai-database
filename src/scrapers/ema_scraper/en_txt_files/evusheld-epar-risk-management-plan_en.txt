EVUSHELD
Centralized
Chemical class:
EVUSHELD is comprised of 2 human IgG1κ mAbs 
(tixagevimab and cilgavimab), which are directed 
against the receptor binding domain of the SARS-
CoV-2 spike protein.
Summary of mode of action: 
The mAbs contained in EVUSHELD bind to non-
overlapping epitopes on the receptor binding domain 
protein of the virus and block its interaction with the 
ACE2 host cellular receptor, resulting in a blockade of 
virus entry, effectively neutralizing the SARS-CoV-2 
virus.
Important information about its composition: 
Tixagevimab and cilgavimab are produced in Chinese 
hamster ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA 
technology. 
EVUSHELD is a combination comprised of the 2 
mAbs (tixagevimab and cilgavimab), each of which 
neutralizes the virus and blocks binding to its human 
cellular receptors. The use of 2 mAbs provides 
redundancy in case of virus mutation and escape. 
Tixagevimab and cilgavimab mAbs have been 
engineered with triple amino acid substitutions
M252Y/S254T/T256E (YTE) in the Fc region to 
prolong the t1/2, which is expected to provide 
protection from COVID-19 for a duration of at least 
6 months. In addition, the triple amino acid 
substitutions L234F/L235E/P331S (TM) in the Fc 
region were engineered for both tixagevimab and 
cilgavimab to reduce Fc-mediated effector function.

COVID-19 Prophylaxis
Treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19
Incidence and prevalence
COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by a novel (or new) coronavirus not previously 
seen in humans – severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2).
To date, there have been over 750 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, 
including over 6.8 million deaths, reported to WHO (WHO 2023a). In Europe, there have 
been over 273 million confirmed cases including over 2.1 million deaths (WHO 2023a).
Since the first reports of COVID-19, infection has spread worldwide, prompting the World 
Health Organisation (WHO) to declare a public health emergency in late January 2020 
(WHO 2020a) and characterise the novel coronavirus as a pandemic in March 2020 (WHO 
2020b).
Demographics of the population in the proposed indication (age, gender, racial and 
ethnic origin), and risk factors for the disease
Individuals of any age can acquire SARS-CoV-2 infection, although the risk of severe 
COVID-19 increases with age. Epidemiological studies suggest that the risk for acute 
COVID-19 occurs at a lower frequency in patients < 18 years old than in adults (CDC 2020a, 
Livingston and Bucher 2020, Wu and McGoogan 2020), with a smaller percentage of children 
with COVID-19 requiring hospitalisation or ICU admission relative to adults (CDC 2020a, 
ECDC 2023). Patients with COVID-19 infection can experience a wide range of symptoms 
from mild to critical illness (ECDC 2023). Older adults, males, and persons with chronic 
medical conditions, including cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic liver 
disease, cancer, obesity, diabetes, pre-existing hypertension, pulmonary disease, 
immunosuppression, and sickle cell disease, are at increased risk of severe or critical disease 
(Gallo Marin et al , Beaney et al 2022, ECDC 2023)
Increasing evidence of disaggregated data from China and Europe suggest that the number of 
confirmed COVID-19 cases is comparable among men and women; however, men may have 
more severe illness and higher mortality from COVID-19 than women (Gebhard et al 2020; 
Beaney et al 2022). Studies from the US have also reported increased mortality with 
COVID-19 in male relative to female patients (Finelli et al 2021). In the US, non-Hispanic 
American Indian, Alaska Native, and Black and Hispanic persons have been affected

disproportionally (Tian et al 2020, Williamson et al 2020, Zheng et al 2020). Ethnicity 
(particularly non-White ethnicity) has been recognised as a predictor for more severe disease, 
and/or risk of hospitalisation in numerous studies (Gao et al 2021). Recent evidence suggests 
that racial disparities in COVID-19 risk were more pronounced in the early waves of the 
pandemic, and that such association is mediated mainly by community-level socioeconomic 
status, contact with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases, and lack of access to clinical 
care (Lo et al 2021, Magesh et al 2021).
The main existing treatment options
Prophylaxis
Currently, 7 first generation vaccines in the EU and 6 vaccines in the UK have been 
authorised or approved for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 in adults, and 3 of these 
vaccines are indicated for use in children or adolescents (EMA 2023a, NHS 2023). Over 
180 candidate vaccines are in clinical development and approximately 200 are in nonclinical 
investigation (WHO 2023b). 
Despite good efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines, breakthrough infections of fully vaccinated 
individuals are emerging both in the general population (Hacisuleyman et al 2021) and in 
high-risk populations, such as patients on immunosuppressants (Geisen et al 2021), patients 
with haematological malignancy (Agha et al 2021), patients who have received a solid organ 
transplant (Boyarsky et al 2021a, Boyarsky et al 2021b), and dialysis patients (Broseta et al 
2021). Data from US and Europe showed that approximately 3% of the population are unable 
to mount an optimal immune response to COVID-19 vaccines and are not receiving the full 
benefit of vaccination (Broseta et al 2021;CDC 2021; Deepak et al 2021; Rabinowich et al 
2021; Simon et al 2021; Lee et al 2021).
The mAbs EVUSHELD (tixagevimab/cilgavimab) and RONAPREVE 
(casirivimab/imdevimab) are the only 2 non-vaccine products approved in the EU for 
prevention of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older (EMA 2023b).
Treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19
Patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection can experience a range of clinical manifestations, from 
no symptoms to critical illness.
Management of COVID-19 is based on best supportive care and emerging standard of care, 
with protective effects demonstrated in clinical studies for some drugs and interventions, 
including antivirals, anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs, anti-inflammatory drugs, and 
immunomodulators. Antivirals and mAb therapies are likely to be most effective earlier in the 
clinical course of disease, when SARS-CoV-2 replication is greatest, or soon after symptom 
onset. Anti-inflammatory drugs and immunomodulators may be used to combat the 
hyperinflammatory state seen in severe disease (Cascella et al 2021).

Version: 5
Individuals with mild disease are managed in the ambulatory setting with supportive care and 
isolation. Close observation over the time course of those with mild disease is advised for the 
elderly and those at increased risk for more severe disease due to pre-existing conditions. 
Where authorised, mAb therapies can be considered for outpatients who are at risk of disease 
progression (Cascella et al 2021).
For the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in patients who do not require supplemental 
oxygen and who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID-19, 4 mAbs (XEVUDY 
[sotrovimab], REGKIRONA [regdanvimab], RONAPREVE [casirivimab/imdevimab], 
EVUSHELD [tixagevimab and cilgavimab]) and 2 anti-viral therapies (VEKLURY 
[remdesivir], PAXLOVID [PF-07321332/ritonavir]) are authorised in the EU (EMA 2023b). 
Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, including 
mortality and morbidity
SARS-CoV-2 infection can be classified into 6 distinct types including asymptomatic or 
presymptomatic infection, as well as mild, moderate, severe, and critical illness. Transmission 
of SARS-CoV-2 may occur from presymptomatic, asymptomatic or symptomatic individuals 
(Cascella et al 2021). Early evidence suggested that viral transmission was possible from 
asymptomatic individuals (CDC 2020b, Lavezzo et al 2020, Oran and Topol 2020). Estimated 
rates of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, however, vary widely with significant 
heterogeneity between studies, with an interquartile range (IQR) of estimates across 130 
studies ranging from 14% to 50% (prediction interval 2% to 90%) (Buitrago-Garcia et al 
2022). Symptomatic patients can experience a range of symptoms from mild to critical illness, 
with shifts in patterns of reported symptoms relative to dominant variants throughout the 
pandemic (Schulze and Bayer 2022).
Based on a large cohort study, which included > 44000 persons with confirmed COVID-19 
from China, the majority of patients experienced mild to moderate illness (Wu and McGoogan 
2020):
 Mild (mild symptoms up to mild pneumonia): 81%

Severe (dyspnoea, hypoxia, or > 50% lung involvement on imaging): 14%
 Critical (respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan system dysfunction): 5%
These early data are consistent with a meta-analysis including > 280000 persons from 11 
countries/regions which estimated the proportion of individuals with severe (and critical) 
disease as 22.9% (Li et al 2021). It is worth noting that patterns of clinical outcomes have 
been changing throughout the pandemic, along with the changing landscape of dominant 
Variants of Concern, the widespread use of COVID-19 vaccines, and the improvement in both 
early detection and management of symptomatic cases. For example, recent research 
13 of 46
EU RMP
tixagevimab and cilgavimab
AstraZeneca
Version: 5
suggested a shift towards atypical but less severe clinical presentation with Omicron vs Delta 
variants (Menni et al 2022).
Overall, among Chinese patients who developed severe illness, the median time to dyspnoea 
ranged from 5 to 8 days, the median time to ARDS ranged from 8 to 12 days, and the median 
time to ICU admission ranged from 10 to 12 days (Huang et al 2020, Wang et al 2020, Yang 
et al 2020, Zhou et al 2020). Based on early reports from China, among all hospitalised 
patients, a range of 26% to 32% of patients were admitted to the ICU. Among all infected 
patients, a range of 3% to 17% developed ARDS compared to a range of 20% to 42% for 
hospitalised patients and 67% to 85% for patients admitted to the ICU. Overall mortality was 
estimated in a large meta-analysis as 5.6% (Li et al 2021), with much higher mortality 
observed among patients admitted to the ICU (39% to 72% depending on the study, with 
improvements seen in ICU mortality over the course of the pandemic (Dennis et al 2021). The 
median length of hospitalisation among survivors was 10 to 13 days (Chen et al 2020, Geisen 
et al 2021, Huang et al 2020, Wang et al 2020, Wu et al 2020, Yang et al 2020).
Data from the SEMI-COVID registry in Spain (a retrospective, multicentre national cohort 
study) demonstrated that immunosuppressed patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19 had 
statistically (p < 0.001) longer hospital stays than those without immunocompromise (median 
10 days vs 9 days) (Suárez-García et al 2021). Immune impairment in this study was also 
associated with 60% higher rates of COVID-19-associated mortality compared to patients 
without immunocompromise, further highlighting the vulnerability of this population to 
SARS-CoV-2 (Suárez-García et al 2021).
Complications associated with COVID-19
 Acute respiratory distress syndrome is the major complication in patients with severe 
disease and can manifest shortly after the onset of dyspnoea. Approximately 12% to 24% 
of hospitalised patients have required mechanical ventilation (Petrilli et al 2020, 
Richardson et al 2020, Yang et al 2020).
 Arrhythmias, acute cardiac injury, cardiomyopathy, and shock (Agha et al 2021, Chen et 
al 2020, Wang et al 2020).
 Acute myocardial infarction is a potential risk in patients with severe systemic 
inflammation and hypercoagulability due to COVID-19 (Long et al 2020). 

Thromboembolic complications, including PE and acute stroke (Danzi et al 2020, Klok et 
al 2020, Mao et al 2020, Zhang et al 2020).
 Large vessel thromboembolisms have also been reported in patients < 50 years of age 
without risk factors (Oxley et al 2020).
 A meta-analysis of studies reporting prevalence of venous thromboembolisms in 
patients with COVID-19 reported a pooled prevalence of PE of 32% (n = 17 studies) 
14 of 46
EU RMP
tixagevimab and cilgavimab
AstraZeneca
Version: 5
and a pooled prevalence of deep vein thrombosis of 27% (n = 32 studies) (Kollias et 
al 2021).

Incidence of stroke in COVID-19 patients ranged from 0.4% to 8.1% across 24 
cohort studies, with a pooled estimate of stroke occurring in 1.4% of patients with 
COVID-19 (Nannoni et al 2021).
 Haematological complications including thrombocytopenia and neutrophilia are a 
hallmark of severe disease (Coopersmith et al 2021). Hypercoagulability in COVID-19 is 
well known. Although the exact mechanisms are unclear, it is thought to be linked to 
cytokine-induced inflammatory response (Abou-Ismail et al, 2020).

Laboratory evidence of increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines, similar to cytokine 
release syndrome, with persistent fevers, elevated inflammatory markers (eg, D-dimer, 
ferritin), and elevated proinflammatory cytokines have been associated with critical and 
fatal illnesses (Huang et al 2020, Mehta et al 2020). Central and peripheral nervous 
system complications including Guillain-Barré syndrome (Paterson et al 2020, Toscano et 
al 2020), encephalopathy (Helms et al 2020), meningoencephalitis (Moriguchi et al 
2020), acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (Paterson et al 2020), and acute necrotising 
encephalopathy (Poyiadji et al 2020).
 Neurologic complications, in particular encephalopathy manifesting with agitated 
delirium, was common in patients with critical illness. 
 Delirium/encephalopathy was reported in approximately two thirds of patients with 
COVID-19-related ARDS (Helms et al 2020).
 A multisystem inflammatory syndrome with clinical features similar to those of Kawasaki 
disease and toxic shock syndrome has been described in children with COVID-19 
(Licciardi et al 2020, Kabeerdoss et al 2021). A similar syndrome has also been reported 
in adults following COVID-19 (Morris et al 2020).


Secondary infections, bacterial or fungal coinfections were reported in 8% of patients (62 
of 806); these included mainly respiratory infections and bacteraemia 
(Rawson et al 2020). Several reports of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis among 
immunocompetent patients with ARDS from COVID-19 have been described 
(Koehler et al 2020, Rutsaert et al 2020).
Psychotic symptoms have been related to other coronavirus infections. Structured 
delusions mixed with confusional features were the most frequent psychiatric 
manifestations observed in the COVID-19 patients. Psychotic symptoms were seen in 
patients with no previous history of psychosis (Parra et al 2020, Rogers et al 2020, 
Varatharaj et al 2020). In a large analysis of electronic health records, the risk of 
psychiatric outcomes including dementia, mood, anxiety, or psychotic disorders were 
significantly higher in the 6 months following COVID-19 than compared to influenza or 
other respiratory tract infection (Taquet et al 2021).


Long-term complications of COVID-19 (post-acute sequelae) can develop following 
infection of any severity, affecting up to 1 in 5 people following acute illness from 
COVID-19. Although sequalae are chronic and often debilitating, long COVID remains 
poorly characterised in current COVID-19 prevention and treatment strategies (Iqbal et al 
2021). Multiple organ systems can be affected, including respiratory, cardiovascular, 
nervous system, musculoskeletal, cutaneous, and neuropsychiatric manifestations 
(Ballering et al 2022).
The typical recovery time from COVID-19 is thought to be approximately 2 to 6 weeks for 
severe and critical illness (WHO 2021). However, the duration of disease is highly variable, 
with recovery time dependent on risk factors (including age) and comorbidities (Mizrahi et al 
2020). Duration of symptoms may be higher in individuals with suboptimal immune responses 
(Dreyer et al 2021). 
Important comorbidities
There are no known comorbidities co-existing within the target population that are deemed to 
be clinically relevant or have an impact on the administration of EVUSHELD.
The risk for severe illness from COVID-19 increases with age, particularly in adults aged 
70 years and older (Wu and McGoogan 2020). In addition, proposed comorbidities associated 
with COVID-19 severity and mortality include cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, 
obesity, diabetes, pulmonary disease, immunosuppression (immunosuppressive disease, 
immunosuppressive medications), immunocompromised state (from solid organ transplant, 
blood or bone marrow transplant, immune deficiencies, HIV), sickle cell disease (ACEP 2020, 
Gallo Marin et al 2021), chronic liver disease, hypertension, and cancer.

MODULE SII: NONCLINICAL PART OF THE SAFETY
SPECIFICATION
II.2.1
Summary of key findings from nonclinical data
Pharmacology
EVUSHELD is a combination of 2 monoclonal antibodies (tixagevimab and cilgavimab) that 
bind to the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Tixagevimab and cilgavimab bind to non-
overlapping epitopes on the spike protein to block its interaction with the ACE2 host cellular 
receptor, resulting in a blockade of virus entry to effectively neutralise SARS-CoV-2(Dong et 
al 2021). Tixagevimab and cilgavimab are derived from B cells of convalescent patients (Zost 
et al 2020). In vitro, EVUSHELD has been shown to neutralise a majority of known SARS-
CoV-2 variants, including Variants of Concern (eg, Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and many 
Omicron variants). AstraZeneca continues to survey and monitor emergent variants and assess 
the in vitro neutralisation activity of EVUSHELD against them. In non-human primates, 
prophylactic administration of EVUSHELD prevented SARS-CoV-2 infection in a dose-

dependent manner; therapeutic administration of EVUSHELD accelerated SARS-CoV-2 
clearance from the lungs and nasal mucosae of infected animals. EVUSHELD administration 
protected non-human primates against virus-induced lung injury and inflammation in either 
setting (Loo et al 2022). 
The typical half-life of a human IgG is approximately 10 to 21 days, participant to recycling 
by FcRn (Bonilla 2008). Tixagevimab and cilgavimab were designed with the AstraZeneca 
proprietary technology to extend mAb t1/2 in humans (YTE; M252Y/S254T/T256E, 
Dall’Acqua et al 2006). The YTE substitutions have been demonstrated to safely extend mAb 
t1/2 to 85 to 117 days in healthy human adults in the Phase I study of nirsevimab (Griffin et al 
2017) and is used in several AstraZeneca mAbs that have been studied in the clinic. 
Pharmacokinetic data from the completed Phase I study (D8850C00001) demonstrated a t1/2 
of both tixagevimab and cilgavimab of approximately 90 days (see D8850C00001 Clinical 
Study Report) confirming a more than 4-fold increase in half-life relative to the 10 to 21 days 
normally observed for non-modified IgG1 antibodies in humans. 
To reduce the theoretical risk of ADE, the 2 antibodies were engineered with amino acid 
substitutions (TM; L234F/L235E/P331S) in the Fc region that reduces IgG binding to FcγR 
and complement proteins (Oganesyan et al 2008). The TM substitutions have been used in a 
number of other AstraZeneca mAb programs in oncology and autoimmune diseases that have 
been studied in the clinic; all have shown an acceptable safety profile (Antonia et al 2018, 
Furie et al 2019, Imfinzi USPI, Morand et al 2020). At physiological serum concentrations, 
tixagevimab and cilgavimab show reduced or no binding to FcγR and C1q complement 
protein, and reduced or no effector function (including ADCC, ADCP, ADCD, and ADNKA). 
Tixagevimab and cilgavimab do not mediate any antibody-dependent infection of immune 
cells that do not express the ACE2 receptor. In SARS-CoV-2 challenge studies, non-human 
primates that received sub-neutralising concentrations of EVUSHELD showed similar viral 
load and lung pathology as animals that received the isotype control antibody (Loo et al 
2022), supporting that EVUSHELD poses minimal risk for ADE. 
The impact of EVUSHELD on vaccine-elicited immune responses were separately evaluated 
in a mouse and a non-human primate model. In these studies, animals were administered 
isotype control mAb or EVUSHELD, followed by a single IM administration of AZD1222 
(the Oxford-AstraZeneca adenovirus-based COVID-19 vaccine), or 2 AZD1222 
immunisations 4 weeks apart. Regardless of whether animals were immunised once or twice, 
those with prior EVUSHELD administration showed vaccine-elicited spike-specific T cell 
responses that were similar to control animals that received isotype mAb. Similarly, all 
vaccinated animals demonstrated similar vaccine-elicited spike- or RBD-specific antibodies, 
regardless of whether they received isotype control mAb or EVUSHELD prior to the 
immunisation. The results demonstrate that EVUSHELD administration minimally alters the 
cellular or the humoral immune responses that are elicited by subsequent COVID-19

Version: 5
vaccinations in nonclinical models. Based on these results, EVUSHELD is not anticipated to 
interfere with vaccine efficacy.
Toxicity
Both of the antibodies that make up EVUSHELD (tixagevimab and cilgavimab) are directed 
against viral targets, specifically, epitopes on the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. 
These targets are not endogenously expressed in healthy animal or human tissues. Therefore, 
and in accordance with ICH S6 (R1), a nonclinical safety programme, including 2 GLP TCR 
studies, (one in adult human and cynomolgus monkey tissues and one in foetal human tissues) 
and a single dose GLP toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys, has been completed. In the 
first TCR study, potential target and off-target binding of each of the individual antibodies and 
the combination to the full panel of 32 different human and cynomolgus monkey adult tissues 
from 3 individual donors was assessed. In the second TCR study (Study 20282218), binding 
of each of the individual antibodies and the combination to a panel of human foetal tissues 
was assessed. In these TCR studies, no binding to any human or cynomolgus monkey adult 
tissues or human foetal tissues was observed. 
Since both antibody components of EVUSHELD are directed at foreign targets that are not 
endogenously expressed in animals or humans, the rationale for species selection for the 
single dose toxicity study was not based on target-binding considerations. Rather, the rationale 
for selection of the cynomolgus monkey as the species for nonclinical safety evaluation is 
based on binding of these antibodies to the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) in the cynomolgus 
monkey.
Key issues identified from acute or repeat-dose toxicity studies
Single dose toxicity: Single dose administration of EVUSHELD via IV infusion was well 
tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys at single IV and IM doses of 600 mg/kg (combination of 
300 mg/kg of tixagevimab and 300 mg/kg of cilgavimab) and 150 mg/kg (75 mg/kg of each 
antibody) respectively (Study 20249158). There were no EVUSHELD-related adverse 
changes in any endpoint examined. EVUSHELD-related changes were confined to mildly 
increased globulins on Day 2 resulting in minimal increases in the total protein and decreases 
in the albumin: globulin ratio. These changes were considered not to be adverse and to be 
related to the administration of 600 mg/kg of EVUSHELD resulting in a rise of globulin 
concentrations. There were no EVUSHELD-related findings in any of the other endpoints 
assessed in the study.
Repeated dose toxicity: No repeated dose toxicity studies have been conducted with 
EVUSHELD. The YTE substitutions and the resulting long half-life of both components 
(tixagevimab and cilgavimab) of EVUSHELD resulted in high exposure during the full 
57 days of follow-up in the single dose toxicology study (Study 20249158). Therefore, 
additional short-term toxicity with repeated dosing was not conducted with EVUSHELD.

Version: 5
Reproductive/developmental toxicity
In accordance with ICH S6 (R1), no studies were conducted and no studies are planned to 
evaluate the effects of EVUSHELD on fertility or embryo-foetal and pre/postnatal 
development because EVUSHELD binds a virus-specific target that is not expressed in 
nonclinical animal models or in humans. Further, EVUSHELD did not bind any of the 
evaluated human reproductive tissues (including placenta) or human foetal tissues in TCR 
studies. 
Genotoxicity
No genotoxicity studies have been conducted with EVUSHELD. In accordance with ICH S6 
(R1), genotoxicity testing has not been conducted, and is not planned, because it is not 
applicable to biotechnology-derived large protein products. EVUSHELD, a combination of 
2 large protein molecules, is not expected to cross the nuclear or mitochondrial membranes to 
interact directly with DNA or other chromosomal materials.
Carcinogenicity
In accordance with ICH S6 (R1), carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with 
EVUSHELD and are not planned given that the target for this product is a virus-specific 
target, which is not expressed in nonclinical animal models or in humans.
Safety pharmacology 
No dedicated safety pharmacology study has been conducted or is planned for EVUSHELD.
Cardiovascular safety pharmacology (electrocardiograms, heart rate, body temperature, and 
blood pressure), respiratory safety pharmacology (respiratory rate), and neurological safety 
pharmacology (neurological observational battery), were assessed as part of the single-dose 
toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys. A single IV dose of 600 mg/kg of EVUSHELD did 
not induce any safety pharmacology effects.

MODULE SIII: CLINICAL TRIAL EXPOSURE
Treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19
A total of 452 adult participants with mild to moderate symptomatic COVID-19 were exposed 
to EVUSHELD in the Phase III Study (TACKLE).
Study D8851C00001 (TACKLE) was a Phase III, randomised (1:1), double-blind, placebo-
controlled clinical trial studying EVUSHELD for the treatment of adult participants with mild 
to moderate COVID-19. The study enrolled individuals who were not hospitalised for 
COVID-19 treatment and had at least one or more COVID-19 symptom that was at least mild 
in severity. Treatment was initiated within 3 days of obtaining the sample for a positive 
SARS-CoV-2 viral infection and within ≤ 7 days of COVID-19 symptom onset. Participants 
received standard of care treatment and either 300 mg of tixagevimab and 300 mg of

cilgavimab (N = 413) or placebo (N = 421), administered as 2 separate intramuscular 
injections. Participants were stratified by time from symptom onset (≤ 5 days vs > 5 days) and 
risk of progression to severe COVID-19 (high risk vs low risk).
The duration of follow-up ranged from 6 to 571 days post-dose, with a median duration of 
follow-up of 458.5 days.

In the COVID-19 prophylaxis studies (D8850C00002 [PROVENT] and D8850C00003 
[STORM CHASER]), a total of 4210 participants were exposed to EVUSHELD. 
PROVENT was a Phase III, randomised (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial 
studying EVUSHELD for the pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 in adults ≥ 18 years of 
age. All participants were individuals considered to be at increased risk for inadequate 
response to active immunisation (due to age ≥ 60 years, co-morbidity, pre-existing chronic 
illness, immunocompromised, or intolerant of vaccination) or at increased risk of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection (due to their location or circumstances at time of enrolment). 
Participants received either a single dose (administered as 2 intramuscular injections) of 
EVUSHELD 300 mg (150 mg of tixagevimab and 150 mg of cilgavimab administered

separately) or placebo. The study excluded participants with a history of laboratory-confirmed 
SARS-CoV-2 infection or SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity at screening.
STORM CHASER was a Phase III randomised (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical 
trial of EVUSHELD for the post-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 in adults ≥ 18 years of 
age. Enrolled participants were at appreciable risk of imminently developing COVID-19 
following potential exposure (within 8 days) to an identified individual with a laboratory-
confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (symptomatic or asymptomatic). Participants received a 
single dose (administered as 2 intramuscular injections) of EVUSHELD 300 mg (150 mg of 
tixagevimab and 150 mg of cilgavimab administered separately) or placebo. The study 
excluded participants with a history of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or 
SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity at screening.
The duration of follow-up ranged from 1 to 605 days post-dose, with a median duration of 
follow-up of 456 days in the PROVENT study and 455 days in the STORM CHASER study.

Exclusion Criteria in pivotal clinical studies within the development 
programme
Pregnant women
Reason for exclusion: Women who were pregnant were excluded from the clinical studies to 
avoid potential harm to the unborn foetus.
Is it considered to be included as missing information: Yes
Paediatric and adolescent patients < 18 years of age
Reason for exclusion: This population was excluded from the pivotal clinical studies based on 
the general principle that paediatric patients are not exposed to an investigational product 
where the benefit-risk profile for the intended adult population has not yet been established, 
rather than due to a specific safety concern. A Phase I paediatric study (TRUST) is now 
ongoing, with 30 paediatric participants recruited to date. 
22 of 46
EU RMP
tixagevimab and cilgavimab
AstraZeneca
Version: 5
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No
Rationale: The safety profile of EVUSHELD is not expected to be different in the indicated 
population of adolescents > 12 years and older weighing  40 kg from the population studied 
in the clinical trials as EVUSHELD is not hepatically or renally excreted. A study on 
paediatric population (≥ 29 weeks gestational age to less than 18 years) is ongoing (TRUST 
study).
History of allergy to any component of the mAbs
Reason for exclusion: Patients with known allergy/hypersensitivity to the active ingredient of 
the investigational medicinal product or excipients, were excluded from the clinical studies 
because these individuals may have a higher risk of severe hypersensitivity (anaphylactic 
reaction). 
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No
Rationale: EVUSHELD is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to active 
substance or excipients; therefore, this population is not relevant to the approved indication.
Clinically significant bleeding disorder (eg, factor deficiency, coagulopathy, or platelet 
disorder), or prior history of significant bleeding or bruising following IM injections or 
venipuncture 
Reason for exclusion: As EVUSHELD is administered as an IM injection, patients with 
history of bleeding disorders were excluded from the clinical studies because they have an 
increased risk of injection haemorrhage or bruising following IM injection.
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No
Rationale: Prevention and management of injection site bleeding after IM injection is fully 
integrated into standard immunisation practice. Therefore, this population/utilisation is not 
relevant for consideration as missing information.
Any prior receipt of investigational or licensed vaccine or other mAb/biologic indicated
for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19
Reason for exclusion: Patients were excluded in order to avoid factors that may confound a 
complete understanding of the efficacy data of EVUSHELD and ensure interpretability of 
data.
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No
Rationale: This population was not excluded on the basis of safety and there is no scientific 
rationale to suspect that the safety profile of EVUSHELD observed in the general population 
23 of 46
EU RMP
tixagevimab and cilgavimab
AstraZeneca
Version: 5
would be impacted by COVID-19 vaccination or prior treatment with a mAb/biologic 
indicated for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2. 
EVUSHELD specifically binds to the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to neutralise 
viral entry and replication. As EVUSHELD binds to the exogenous SARS-CoV-2 target, it is 
not expected that there will be any impact on the safety profile for EVUSHELD in patients 
who have received prior treatment with a mAb that has endogenous targets. The presence of 
another mAb is unlikely to impact EVUSHELD PK parameters including clearance and 
elimination. In addition, mAbs are cleared via high capacity nonspecific endocytosis followed 
by lysosomal degradation. Therefore, it is unlikely that mAbs will demonstrate any PK 
interaction at therapeutic concentrations. Any ADAs resulting from another mAb are unlikely 
to affect the safety of EVUSHELD. Anti-drug-antibodies against another commercial mAb or 
EVUSHELD are unlikely to cross-react since mAb ADAs are typically against the highly 
specific target-binding epitope.
It is expected that COVID-19 vaccine may be given either before or after administration of 
EVUSHELD. Data from animal studies reported that 1 to 3 days prior to EVUSHELD
administration did not alter the cellular or the humoral immune responses elicited by 
subsequent COVID-19 vaccinations (Study MCBS7442-0012). The available clinical safety 
data do not reveal any additional safety concerns for participants who were exposed to 
EVUSHELD in PROVENT and STORM CHASER and who then subsequently received 
COVID-19 vaccines. Based on these results, EVUSHELD is not anticipated to interfere with 
vaccine safety or efficacy. Although there are no clinical data available on the use of 
EVUSHELD following COVID-19 vaccination, there is no evidence that prior vaccination for 
other diseases (eg, rabies and hepatitis) impacts the safety or efficacy of subsequent 
immunoglobulin treatment. Therefore, the use of EVUSHELD, either prior to or following 
vaccination, is not relevant for consideration as missing information, and further 
characterisation of this population is not required.
History of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) or Middle East 
respiratory syndrome (MERS)
Reason for exclusion: Patients were excluded to avoid factors that may confound a complete 
understanding of the efficacy data of EVUSHELD and ensure interpretability of data.
Is it considered to be included as missing information: No
Rationale: This population was not excluded on the basis of safety, and there is no scientific 
rationale to suspect that the safety profile in this population is different to that of the general 
target population. Further characterisation of this population is neither feasible nor warranted.

Identification of safety concerns in the initial RMP submission
This section describes the safety concerns at the time of RMP Version 1 approval.
II.7.1.1
Risk not considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in 
the RMP Version 1
Reasons for not including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety concerns in 
the RMP
Potential risks that require no further characterisation 
Serious hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis: Hypersensitivity including 
anaphylaxis are acute serious allergic reactions with multi-organ-system involvement that can 
present as, or rapidly progress to, a severe life-threatening reaction requiring immediate 
medical attention. Acute allergic reactions may include hypotension, dyspnoea, cyanosis, 
respiratory failure, urticaria, pruritus, angioedema, hypotonia, and unresponsiveness 
(including shock). Monoclonal antibodies have the potential to cause anaphylaxis and other 
serious hypersensitivity reactions, including immune complex disease, which could induce the 
development of ADA. The occurrence of such ADA could result in immune complex disease 
(with manifestations such as arthralgias, serum sickness, nephritis, and vasculitis) or altered 
EVUSHELD levels or activity.
There were no related SAEs of anaphylaxis or serious hypersensitivity reactions reported in 
the EVUSHELD clinical programme. 
Healthcare professionals are familiar with this risk, and the management of this risk is 
integrated into routine medical practice when administering protein-based infusion/injection 
therapies. Therefore, the risk of serious hypersensitivity reactions is considered to be a 
potential risk not categorised as important for inclusion in the RMP. The potential risk of 
serious hypersensitivity, including anaphylaxis are followed up via routine pharmacovigilance 
namely through signal detection and adverse reaction reporting, and risk minimisation 
messages in the product information are expected to be adhered to by prescribers (see

Potential risks also not considered important

Antibody-dependent enhancement of disease (ADE): ADE is a theoretical risk for all mAbs 
used for prevention of COVID-19. One of the syndromes of ADE involves increased binding 
efficiency of virus-antibody complexes to Fc receptor bearing cells, which trigger virus entry. 
The mAbs in EVUSHELD have been designed with a modification to prevent binding to 
cellular Fc receptors, so the risk of ADE occurring via this mechanism should range from very 
low to none. Several nonpreclinical studies have been conducted to assess the potential risk 
of ADE following administration of EVUSHELD. The data are consistent with that from other 
mAbs with TM substitutions in their Fc region that reduce antibody effector function and 
support that EVUSHELD, and the 2 mAbs that comprise it, pose minimal theoretical risk for 
mediating ADE. Potential clinical outcomes resulting from ADE include lack of therapeutic 
effect progressing to unanticipated worsening of COVID-19, which has not been observed in 
the clinical trials to date. An impact on therapeutic effectiveness due to ADE is unlikely given 
the design of EVUSHELD. For these reasons ADE is not considered to impact the benefit-risk 
profile of EVUSHELD. 
Cardiac and thromboembolic events: In Study D8850C00002 (PROVENT), at the DCO of 
29 August 2021, there was a small numerical imbalance in SAEs in the Cardiac disorders 
SOC between the treatment groups (23 [0.7%] in the EVUSHELD group and 5 [0.3%] in the 
placebo group). There were no reports of Cardiac disorders SAEs in Study D8850C00003 
(STORM CHASER) (19 August 2021 DCO). In Study D8851C00001 (TACKLE), at DCO 
21 August 2021 there were 2 (0.4%) SAEs in the Cardiac disorders SOC in the EVUSHELD 
and 1 (0.2%) in the placebo group. None of the Cardiac disorder SAEs in the EVUSHELD 
group were considered related to the investigational product by the investigator. All 
participants who experienced cardiac disorder SAEs had cardiac-related risk factors and/or a 
prior history of cardiovascular disease at baseline. There was no clear temporal pattern, and a 
causal relationship between EVUSHELD and these events has not been established. The SAEs 
from SMQ Embolic and thrombotic events were also reviewed from these 2 studies 
(PROVENT and STORM CHASER), there is no clinically meaningful imbalance in 
thromboembolic events between participants who received EVUSHELD and those who 
received placebo. Across the cases, many participants had confounding cardiac-related 
medical histories and risk factors present at baseline. The cardiac and thromboembolic events 
will continue to be closely monitored as part of routine pharmacovigilance activities. For these 
reasons, cardiac and thromboembolic events are not considered to impact the benefit-risk 
profile of EVUSHELD and routine pharmacovigilance activities are considered sufficient to 
monitor these events. A specific adverse reaction follow-up targeted questionnaire for cardiac 
SAEs will be implemented. There are no additional pharmacovigilance activities, clinical 
measures, or additional risk minimisation measures in place and cardiac and thromboembolic 
events are not considered important.

Identified risks not considered important: 
AstraZeneca
Version: 5
Identified risks based on class effect and route of administration that do not impact the risk 
benefit profile are listed below:
Injection site reactions: Injection site reactions may be observed with administration of 
EVUSHELD. They may manifest as local inflammation, redness, itching, pain, bruising, 
infection, or excessive bleeding at the site of injection. These reactions are managed according 
to standard clinical practice and product labelling (see Section 4.8 SmPC).
Hypersensitivity including rash and urticaria: Non-serious hypersensitivity reactions can 
occur with use of mAbs. These reactions are managed according to standard clinical practice 
and product labelling (see Section 4.8 SmPC). 
II.7.1.2
Risks considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the 
RMP
Important Identified Risks
There are no important identified risks for EVUSHELD.
Important Potential Risks
There are no important potential risks for EVUSHELD.
Missing Information: Use in pregnant women
Pregnant women are at an increased risk for severe illness from COVID-19 compared to 
nonpregnant women. Therefore, it is important to further evaluate the impact of EVUSHELD 
in pregnant women as exposure is anticipated, and EVUSHELD is not contraindicated in this 
population.
Pregnant women were excluded from the clinical studies.
Risk benefit impact: 
There are insufficient data to determine the safety profile in pregnant women. Nonclinical 
reproductive toxicity studies have not been conducted with EVUSHELD. However, a foetal 
TCR study demonstrated no binding to foetal tissues. Human IgG1 antibodies are known to 
cross the placental barrier; therefore, EVUSHELD has the potential to be transferred from the 
mother to the developing foetus. It is unknown whether the potential transfer of EVUSHELD 
provides any benefit or risk to the foetus (see Section 4.6 SmPC, “EVUSHELD should only 
be used during pregnancy if the potential benefit outweighs the potential risk for the mother 
and the foetus”).

Evidence source: There is a limited amount of data for the use of EVUSHELD in pregnant 
and/or lactating women, or from women who became pregnant after receiving EVUSHELD. 
While nonclinical safety studies have not indicated any concerns, the effect of EVUSHELD 
on the foetus is unknown, as data are currently insufficient to inform on any associated risk.
Population in need of further characterisation: Use of EVUSHELD in pregnant women will be 
monitored via routine safety surveillance activities.

ROUTINE PHARMACOVIGILANCE ACTIVITIES
Routine Pharmacovigilance Activities
AstraZeneca undertakes routine pharmacovigilance activities consistent with the International 
Council for Harmonisation (ICH) E2E Pharmacovigilance Planning Guideline. Routine 
pharmacovigilance activities (as defined by standard operating procedures and guidelines) are 
30 of 46
EU RMP
tixagevimab and cilgavimab
AstraZeneca
Version: 5
designed to rapidly assess the ongoing safety profile of EVUSHELD throughout clinical 
development and in the post-authorisation period in order to characterise and communicate 
pertinent safety data appropriately. A comprehensive description of all aspects of the 
pharmacovigilance system is provided in the Pharmacovigilance System Master File, which is 
available upon request.
Specific adverse reaction follow-up questionnaires for safety concerns:
There are no follow-up questionnaires for safety concerns for EVUSHELD. However, there 
are follow-up questionnaires in place for lack of efficacy (refer to Other forms of routine 
pharmacovigilance activities below) and cardiac events (refer to Section II.7.1.1). 
Other forms of routine pharmacovigilance activities:
Continuous and thorough reviews of genomic databases such as GISAID for emerging 
Variants of Interest and Variants of Concern will be conducted. Phenotypic evaluation of 
specific variants that are prevalent or becoming prevalent with substitutions in or near the 
target epitopes of the antibodies that make up EVUSHELD will follow when appropriate. 
Cumulative data from these reviews will be summarised in the PSUR under the section of 
“Lack of efficacy from post-marketing”. This PSUR section also summarises the lack of 
efficacy cases reported during post-authorisation use cumulatively and for the reporting 
interval.
A follow-up questionnaire was implemented for lack of efficacy cases from post-authorisation 
use.
As part of the enhanced signal detection activities for the duration of the COVID-19 
pandemic, AstraZeneca will monitor data on treatment failure due to emerging variants from 
all available data sources, including but not limited to: 

Spontaneous cases (via targeted follow-up questionnaire for lack of efficacy including 
fields to request information on the variant)
 Clinical trial data from MAH and development partners


Literature
Studies conducted by public health authorities
If the review of the data leads to an impact on the benefit risk of the product, AstraZeneca will 
submit the data to EMA, including a benefit-risk discussion and any warranted product 
information updates within 1 month via appropriate variation procedure.
Periodic and cumulative data on the use in pregnancy will be presented in PSUR. AstraZeneca 
will present a tabular format for reporting numbers of individual case safety reports in the 
PSUR in line with the EMA draft guideline EMA/653036/2019.

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
FOR EVUSHELD (TIXAGEVIMAB AND CILGAVIMAB)
This is a summary of the RMP for EVUSHELD. The RMP details important risks of 
EVUSHELD, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about the risks and uncertainties for EVUSHELD (missing information).
EVUSHELD's Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how EVUSHELD should be 
used. 
This summary of the RMP for EVUSHELD should be read in the context of all this 
information, including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
EVUSHELD's RMP.
VI.1
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
EVUSHELD is indicated for the pre-exposure prophylaxis and treatment of COVID-19 in 
adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older weighing at least 40 kg (see SmPC for the full 
indication). It contains tixagevimab and cilgavimab as the active substances, and it is given by 
IM administration.
Further information about the evaluation of EVUSHELD’s benefits can be found in 
EVUSHELD’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA

(https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/evusheld).
VI.2
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND 
ACTIVITIES TO MINIMIZE OR FURTHER CHARACTERISE 
THE RISKS
Important risks of EVUSHELD, together with measures to minimise such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about EVUSHELD risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be:




Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC/PI addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorised pack size – the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly;
The medicine’s legal status – the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and analysed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of EVUSHELD is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below.
VI.2.1
List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of EVUSHELD are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimise the risk (see Table VI-1 and Table VI-2), so that the medicinal 
product can be safely administered. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. 
Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of 
EVUSHELD. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established and 
needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the 
medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the long-term use 
of the medicine).

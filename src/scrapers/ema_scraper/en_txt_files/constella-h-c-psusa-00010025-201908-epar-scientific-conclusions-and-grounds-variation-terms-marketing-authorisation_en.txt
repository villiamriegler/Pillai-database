Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for linaclotide, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on the signal of “urticaria” from clinical trials and spontaneous reports including 
in 17 cases with a close temporal relationship and a positive de-challenge as well as two cases with a 
positive re-challenge the PRAC considers a causal relationship between linaclotide and urticaria is 
established. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing linaclotide should 
be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for linaclotide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing linaclotide is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The prevalence of T2DM has increased dramatically throughout the world, and is expected to continue to 
rise from approximately 366 million adults in 2011 to 552 million adults by 2030. T2DM is a chronic illness 
associated with a number of long-term microvascular (ie, nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy) and 
macrovascular (ie, cardiovascular [CV] disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease) complications.  
Current pharmacologic interventions for T2DM include a diverse range of antidiabetic medications with 
different mechanisms of action, developed to manage the 2 different aspects of the disease: reduced 
insulin secretion and peripheral insulin resistance. The main classes of oral agents include biguanides (eg, 
MET), SUs (eg, glipizide), TZDs (eg, pioglitazone), and other DPP-4 inhibitors (eg, sitagliptin). Insulin and 
glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs (eg, exenatide and liraglutide) are also commercially available 
and are administered by injection. Many therapies have clinically important side effects, such as 
hypoglycaemia (SUs), weight gain, fluid retention and heart failure (TZDs), and gastrointestinal effects 
and lactic acidosis (MET). 
A relatively new class of agents, DPP-4 inhibitors, has emerged as a novel treatment to help manage 
T2DM. In patients with T2DM, actions of the incretin hormones GLP-1 and glucose-dependent 
insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are blunted, which contributes to hyperglycaemia. GLP-1 and GIP are 
released into the bloodstream in response to meals/glucose levels, but are quickly inactivated by DPP-4. 
Inhibition of DPP-4 increases circulating blood levels of GLP-1 and GIP, thereby increasing insulin levels 
and decreasing glucagon levels. 
The aim of the clinical program was to investigate the therapeutic effect and safety profile in the target 
population of T2DM subjects. As such, Phase III studies were designed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, 
and tolerability of alogliptin compared with placebo and active comparators when used in combination 
with widely used and effective antidiabetic agents, MET, SU, TZD, and insulin. The clinical program was 
also designed to support global registration of alogliptin as a monotherapy product and in combination 
with the approved oral antidiabetic medications pioglitazone and MET, as fixed-dose combination (FDC) 
tablets. Fixed dose combinations are described in more detail in separate European Public Assessment 
Reports for these products. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 7/96 
 
 
  
 
Alogliptin and the alogliptin/pioglitazone FDC were first approved in Japan in April 2010 and 
July 2011, respectively  (25 mg with 12.5 and 6.25 mg for renally impaired patients and 25/15 mg and 
25/30 mg alogliptin/pioglitazone).  
For this MAA, key guidance documents considered in the design of the clinical development program 
included the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) and the Note for Guidance on Clinical 
Investigation of Medicinal Products in the Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus (May 2002). The program is also 
largely consistent with the later draft guidance (September 2011). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is manufactured as oval, biconvex, immediate-release tablets in 3 strengths: 6.25 
mg, 12.5 mg and 25 mg containing alogliptin (as benzoate). All three strengths of the drug product have 
the same nominal dimensions (9.1 mm long by 5.1 mm wide and 3.7 mm thick). The 3 strengths are 
distinguished both by color and by dose specific imprinted markings on one side.  
The composition is further detailed in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The product is available in polychlorotrifluoroethylene / polyvinylchloride (PCTFE/PVC) blister as 
described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance Alogliptin Benzoate 
The active substance alogliptin benzoate (INN: alogliptin) is a white crystalline odourless powder, soluble 
in dimethylsulfoxide, sparingly soluble in methanol, slightly soluble in tetrahydrofuran, and practically 
insoluble in toluene and diethyl ether. The aqueous solubility is high and independent of the pH between 
3 and 11. The chemical name 
is2-({6-[(3R)-3-aminopiperidin-1-yl]-3-methyl-2,4-dioxo-3,4-dihydropyrimidin-1(2H)-yl}methyl)-benz
onitrile monobenzoate, also known as 
2-[[6-[(3R)-3-Amino-1-piperidinyl]-3,4-dihydro-3-methyl-2,4-dioxo-1(2H)-pyrimidinyl]methyl]benzoni
trile monobenzoateand has the structural formula C25H27N5O4. It is a 1:1 salt between alogliptin and 
benzoic acid. 
The structure of alogliptin benzoate was unambiguously confirmed by NMR, UV, and IR spectroscopy, 
mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and an X-ray crystal structural study.  
Physico-chemical properties such as crystalline form, optical rotation and partition coefficients have been 
detailed. Although alogliptin exhibits polymorphism, a single stable polymorphic form is routinely 
delivered by the manufacturing process. The active substance is not hygroscopic. It has a single chiral 
centre and is manufactured as the R enantiomer.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 8/96 
 
 
  
 
The chemical structure of alogliptin benzoate is: 
Manufacture 
Alogliptin is synthesized in three steps from commercially available, well-defined starting materials. The 
active substance is then milled to attain the desired particle size. Detailed information about the 
manufacturing process, control of starting materials, reagents and solvents, control of critical steps and 
intermediates along with process development and validation has been provided. 
The manufacturing process is adequately described. The full 3-step process can be carried out in its 
entirety at one manufacturer. Alternatively, step 1 is carried out at a different manufacturer. The 
synthetic scheme, including the raw materials suppliers and process descriptions is identical for all 
manufacturing sites although the scales differ. The starting materials are well-defined, commercially 
available and purchased from vendors who have demonstrated the ability to supply materials that 
consistently meet the established acceptance criteria. Appropriate specifications have been adopted for 
the starting materials, taking into account their route of synthesis and impact on active substance quality. 
The applicant has discussed the formation and control of potential and actual impurities, including 
genotoxins, degradants, and residual solvents at each step of the synthesis. Critical process parameters 
were identified for each step and appropriate limits defined. All relevant impurities have been 
appropriately characterised and are well controlled by the process and intermediate specifications. 
Therefore, the manufacturer has good control over the manufacturing process and the described 
in-process controls and specifications are considered adequate to ensure the required quality of active 
substance. 
Alogliptin benzoate is packaged in double low-density polyethylene (LDPE) bags closed by a plastic tie. 
The bags are then stored in a fiberboard drum for further protection. The information on the container 
closure system is considered acceptable and supports the stability of alogliptin benzoate. The plastic 
materials in direct contact with the substance are stated to be in compliance with the EU regulations.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes the following parameters: appearance (visual and XRD), 
identification (UV, IR, HPLC), heavy metals (USP method), content of (S)-enantiomer (chiral HPLC), 
related substances (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water (Ph.Eur. 2.5.12), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur. 
2.4.14), assay (HPLC) and particle size (laser diffraction). The specifications have been adequately 
justified and are in compliance with the ICH guidelines including ICH Q3A(R2) and ICH Q3C for residual 
solvents. The potential effect of particle size on the dissolution properties of alogliptin tablets was 
investigated, and it was found to be negligible within the range evaluated. 
The analytical results of 46 batches of alogliptin (manufactured and used in development, preclinical, 
clinical, stability studies as well as used for the purpose of validation and registration) have been

provided. Results were found within the set specification. Analytical methods have been described and 
non-compendial methods validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
Stability 
Three pilot-scale batches of the active substance stored in the commercial packaging were put on stability 
studies under long-term (25 °C / 60% RH) for up to 60 months and accelerated (40 °C / 75% RH) for up 
to 6 months as per ICH guidelines. Additional stress studies (heat (50, 60 oC), humidity (93% RH) and 
photostability (white fluorescent and UV light) in line with ICH option 2) were performed on one batch for 
3 months. The parameters tested in the stability studies were appearance, crystallinity, identification, 
(S)-enantiomer, related substances, (R)-3-aminopiperidine, water content, assay and microbiological 
limits. The analytical procedures were detailed and validated. No significant changes were observed to 
any of the monitored parameters under any of the tested conditions. Furthermore, stability of the 
polymorphic form was demonstrated. 
Forced degradation studies were also carried out and identified several degradation products formed 
under acidic, basic, and oxidative aqueous conditions. The drug substance was shown to be stable in 
neutral aqueous solution, even on exposure to light. 
The stability studies indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
Alogliptin benzoate is identified as a single stable crystal form, which is manufactured for use in the 
finished product. Although particle size has been shown not to influence exposure to alogliptin, 
specifications were in place to control the particle size distribution of the active substance to ensure 
content uniformity.  
The solubility of alogliptin benzoate has been studied extensively in both routine characterization studies 
as well as more rigorous evaluations for the purposes of establishing the classification of the drug 
substance defined by the EMA [Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence, January 2010] and FDA 
[Guidance for Industry; Waiver of In-Vivo Bioavailability and Bioequivalence Studies for 
Immediate-Release Solid Oral Dosage Forms Based on a Biopharmaceutics Classification System, August 
2000] regulatory guidances. Alogliptin was found to be a highly soluble compound. 
All excipients are conventional for their pharmaceutical function. The excipients for the core tablets are: 
mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose , hydroxypropylcellulose, croscarmellose sodium , magnesium 
stearate. For the film-coating the excipients are: hypromellose, titanium dioxide, iron oxide yellow and 
red.  
For the polishing solution, macrogol is used and for the printing ink solution printing gray ink is used.  
Alogliptin demonstrated good compatibility with all excipients used in their respective granulations and 
with the excipients used for film-coating. Each excipient was chosen based on its required function for the 
formulation and on successful demonstration of compatibility with the active substance.  
The amounts of excipients were selected based on experiments performed to study excipient ranges and 
their effects on drug product performance and manufacturability. All excipients are compendial (Ph.Eur, 
Commission Directive 95/45/EC or the USP/NF) except the printing ink. The ink is prepared from 
components that meet compendial specifications on an individual basis or comply with relevant regulatory 
standards. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 10/96 
 
 
  
 
The goal of the development was an orally available formulation with good stability and dissolution 
characteristics, which would be adaptable for different strengths using only minor adjustments in 
composition. Tablets were chosen due to the bioavailability and good solubility of alogliptin. A film-coating 
was applied to mask the bitter taste of the active substance.  
The dosage strength 6.25 mg, 12.5 mg and 25 mg have been applied for in this centralised procedure. 
The formulations used in the clinical evaluation of alogliptin were manufactured with a different 
granulation process compared to the tablets that will be commercialised.  
As pharmaceutical development resulted in substantial changes to the Phase III pivotal clinical 
formulation to create the proposed commercial tablets, in-vitro studies were conducted to confirm that 
the dissolution performance of the two formulations was essentially equivalent prior to evaluating them in 
clinical studies. Comparative dissolution profiles for the Phase III and commercial formulations under the 
specified dissolution conditions demonstrated that there was no significant difference in the dissolution 
performance for the two formulations. 
A strength biowaiver was granted for the 6.25 mg strength based on dissolution studies that 
demonstrated that all strengths of alogliptin tablets rapidly dissolved according to ICH Q6A guidance and 
had similar dissolution profile. 
The important aspects of the manufacturing process were evaluated both during development and 
pilot-scale studies. No critical operating parameters were identified and processes validated. Based on 
these results and applicant’s experience on development and production of other tablet products, 
optimization and further validation studies were performed to establish the final operating conditions at 
commercial scale, leading to the final choice of acceptable process parameter ranges.  
Additionally, general operating conditions were also selected based on previous experience of the 
applicant with conventional tablet manufacturing.  
The proposed commercial packaging system for alogliptin tablets is PCTFE/PVC blisters with aluminium 
push-through lidding foil and is adequate to support stability and use of the product. The materials comply 
with EU regulation 10/2011 and Ph. Eur. 3.1.11 where applicable.  
Manufacture of the product 
The commercial process is a standard manufacturing process. 
Based on validation data on three production batches of each  strength and adequacy of in-process 
controls, it is considered that the manufacture is sufficiently robust to produce alogliptin film-coated 
tablets of consistent quality. 
Adequate in-process controls have been put in place and included parameters such as control of blending, 
compression and film-coating steps. 
Product specification 
The proposed release and shelf-life specifications for the Alogliptin 6.25 mg 12.5 mg and 25 mg tablets 
include appropriate tests for: appearance (visual), identification (UV and HPLC), content uniformity (Ph. 
Eur. 2.9.40), dissolution, assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC) and microbiological quality(Ph. Eur.) 
The specification and control tests applied for the drug product at time of release and throughout the shelf 
life of the drug substance, are in compliance with general pharmacopoeial standards (including Ph Eur) 
and ICH guidelines (Q3B and Q6A).  The related substances do not raise any safety concern. The 
specifications for release and throughout shelf life are identical except identification and uniformity of 
content (only tested at release) and assay.  The limits for each specification test are achievable by the

production process and are supported by stability study data. Analytical methods have been described 
and non-compendial methods have been validated in accordance with ICH guidelines Q2B, Validation of 
Analytical Procedures. The methods are suitable for their intended use. 
Batch analysis data were provided for three pilot-scale batches of each strength 6.5 mg , 4 batches of 
strength 12.5 mg and 4 batches of strength 25 mg. The batch analysis results are within the proposed 
specification. The batch analysis data indicate that the manufacture is sufficiently robust to produce 
Alogliptin 6.5 mg, 12.5 mg and 25 mg tablets of consistent quality, complying with the designated 
specifications. 
Stability of the product 
Stability studies of three pilot batches of each strength, 6.25 mg, strength 12.5 mg and 25 mg stored 
under long term conditions for 48 months at 25 °C / 60% RH and accelerated conditions for 6 months at 
40 °C / 75% RH according to ICH conditions were provided. The batches were kept in the commercial 
packaging. The parameters studied were appearance, assay, related substances, dissolution, loss on 
drying, and hardness at all-time points; microbiological quality at significant intervals (6-month intervals 
through 12 months storage and annually thereafter). The analytical methods were stability indicating. 
Additional studies under both long-term and accelerated conditions in the bulk tablet shipping container 
were conducted. Photostability studies were also performed on one batch of each strength under ICH Q1B 
conditions. Tested parameters were appearance assay, related substances, dissolution, loss on drying, 
and hardness. No significant differences were observed between exposed and control tablets. 
No significant change could be observed during the long term and accelerated stability studies. In 
addition, results of related substances were below the ICH identification threshold for all conditions and all 
strengths. All stability results have met the proposed specifications in the proposed commercial 
packaging configuration. 
Results in bulk package stability studies carried out to 24 months of long-term storage and 3 months of 
accelerated storage were consistent and satisfactory. Photostability studies showed that alogliptin tablets 
are not sensitive to light exposure. 
Based on stability data, the proposed shelf-life when the alogliptin tablets are kept in the commercial 
packaging and in line with the SmPC conditions is acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Quality Development 
Information on development, manufacture and controls applied to alogliptin and the finished product, 
along with the controls over the manufacturing process of the active substance and the drug product, 
support that the Alogliptin film-coated tablets can be routinely manufactured to conform to the current 
expectations for this type of dosage form. The drug product is a standard dosage form manufactured by 
a standard manufacturing process. No critical steps were identified in the manufacturing process. 
The results of the tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these turn in lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in the clinic. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of Vipidia film-coated tablets is considered to be acceptable when used in the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of these tablets have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

N/A 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Alogliptin is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of the dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 enzyme that is 
being developed as an antihyperglycemic agent.  
Alogliptin has been characterized in a battery of in vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic, 
and toxicologic studies. Alogliptin, as synthesized, exists predominantly as the (R)-enantiomer (>99%). 
In vivo chiral conversion to (S)-alogliptin is minimal. Alogliptin is metabolized to 2 metabolites, an 
N-demethylated metabolite (M-I) and an N-acetylated metabolite (M-II). M-I has DPP-4 inhibitory activity 
that is similar to alogliptin, whereas the (S)-enantiomer has minimal DPP-4 inhibitory activity, and M-II 
does not inhibit DPP-4 in vitro. 
Pivotal toxicity and safety pharmacology studies were conducted in compliance with the good laboratory 
practice (GLP). 
The intended clinical route of administration is oral; therefore, with the exception of an IV single dose 
toxicity study in rats, IV and paravenous tolerance studies in rabbits, and an IP micronucleus study in 
mice, alogliptin was administered orally (gavage or capsule) in the in vivo toxicological evaluations. 
Nonclinical studies assessing immunotoxicity, including in vitro assessments for immune function and 
immunophenotyping of leukocyte populations, were not conducted with alogliptin. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
2.3.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro Pharmacodynamic assays 
The primary pharmacological activity of alogliptin was determined in various enzyme assays. The target 
enzyme, dipeptidyl peptidase-4, was inhibited in vitro by alogliptin with an IC50 (nM) ranging from 6 to 18 
depending on source of enzyme. The assays demonstrated that alogliptin is a potent and specific inhibitor 
of rat, dog, and human DPP-4 activity. Similar to alogliptin, the M-I metabolite is equipotent and a 
selective inhibitor of DPP-4. No inhibitory activity was noted for M-II, while weak DPP-4 inhibition was 
noted for the (S)-enantiomer of alogliptin. The R-enantiomer is 1000-times  more active than the 
(S)-enantiomer. 
An assay comparing the potency and selectivity of alogliptin with other DPP-4 inhibitors (vildagliptin and 
sitagliptin) showed that alogliptin was more potent, and generally more selective; mean IC50 values for 
DPP-4 inhibition for alogliptin, vildagliptin, and sitagliptin were 6.9 nmol/L, 23.8 nmol/L, and 12.1 nmol/L, 
respectively. 
In Vivo Primary Pharmacodynamic Assays 
The effects of alogliptin on DPP-4 activity were assessed in normal, euglycemic animals and in various 
animal models of T2DM. These in vivo studies evaluated the effects of alogliptin on diabetic parameters 
such as GHb, glucose tolerance, and plasma glucose and insulin levels, as well as effects on endocrine 
pancreatic function and morphology. In vivo, alogliptin was pharmacologically active in normoglycemic 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 13/96 
 
 
  
 
mice, rats, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys and in mouse and rat models of T2DM. Alogliptin improved 
glucose tolerance and increased plasma insulin levels in normal mice.  
A single dose of alogliptin to wild-type C57BL/6 mice decreased the normalized plasma glucose area 
under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 90 minutes (AUC(0-90min)) to 75% of control 
values and increased plasma insulin levels to 146% of control values. When administered in the diet to 
diabetic ob/ob mice for 4 weeks, alogliptin decreased GHb and increased plasma insulin levels, plasma 
insulin/glucose ratio, and pancreatic insulin levels. 
In established rat models of T2DM, female Wistar fatty rats and nonobese N-STZ-1.5 rats, alogliptin 
produced a dose-dependent improvement in glucose tolerance and a dose-dependent increase in plasma 
immunoreactive insulin (IRI) levels. 
Oral administration of alogliptin to normal cynomolgus monkeys increased insulin and GLP-1 levels and 
decreased glucagon levels with no notable effect on plasma glucose. 
Alogliptin increased pancreatic insulin content in ob/ob mice and male N-STZ-1.5 rats. 
Immunohistochemical analyses of pancreatic β-cell and α-cell morphology in the ob/ob mice following 4 
weeks of daily exposure to alogliptin revealed increased staining of the β-cells for insulin-like 
immunoreactivity. Apparent changes in β-cell number and size in the islets could not be detected, 
suggestive of a lack of β-cell proliferation or hypertrophy. There were no apparent changes in α-cell 
morphology. 
2.3.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary activity of alogliptin at concentrations of 1 and 10 µmol/L was evaluated in vitro in receptor 
binding assays and enzyme activity screening. At the high concentration alogliptin caused a 50% 
inhibition of naloxane binding at the opioid receptor in the rat cerebral cortex. No activity equal to or 
exceeding 50% was evident on other receptors, ion channels or enzymes. 
GLP-1 has been associated with decreased gastrointestinal (GI) motility and appetite. In vivo studies 
have shown that a single dose of alogliptin is effective in lowing plasma glucose levels, increasing plasma 
intact GLP-1 levels, and increasing plasma IRI levels in Wistar fatty rats. However, in this same strain 
(Wistar fatty rat), exposure to alogliptin for 8 consecutive weeks did not produce notable changes in body 
weight or in metabolic indices. Plasma total cholesterol (TC) was statistically decreased (p≤0.025) at the 
highest dose evaluated (10 mg/kg/day). Unlike the DPP-4 inhibition that occurred in this model after a 
single dose of alogliptin, only minimal DPP-4 inhibition was observed after 8 consecutive weeks of 
treatment. 
A study to investigate effect of alogliptin or metformin on xylose absorption in male Wistar fatty rats was 
conducted. Metformin or alogliptin (1 mg/kg) were administered 1 hour prior to xylose challenge. No 
effect of alogliptin on xylose absorption was noted while metformin dose-dependently inhibited xylose 
absorption. 
2.3.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
The potential of alogliptin to elicit unintended pharmacological activity in non-target systems has been 
investigated. With the exception of preliminary, investigative hERG assays with the HCl and TFA salts and 
the action potential duration assay; the core safety pharmacology studies were conducted in compliance 
with GLPs. 
CHMP assessment report

Central Nervous System 
Alogliptin is unlikely to have untoward pharmacologic activity in the central nervous system (CNS). 
Although alogliptin inhibited naloxone binding at nonselective opioid receptors in vitro in the rat cerebral 
cortex, it did not show any binding affinity for human receptors typically associated with abuse potential 
(human recombinant opiate receptors). In vivo, no noteworthy alogliptin-related effects on general 
behavior and activity were observed in rats at doses of up to 300 mg/kg/day for 4 consecutive weeks. The 
evaluations were performed at day -1, day 1 and day 25 and included open-field observations, forelimb 
and hindlimb grip strength, hindlimb splay and pain perception. 
Respiratory and Cardiovascular Systems 
Alogliptin is not expected to interfere with respiratory or cardiovascular function at the proposed clinical 
dosage of 25 mg/day. The IC50 value for the in vitro inhibition of human ether a-go-go-related gene 
(hERG) channel currents by alogliptin was >30 μmol/L. At concentrations up to 30 μmol/L, alogliptin did 
not delay action potential repolarization in isolated canine Purkinje fibers, and no alogliptin-related effects 
on resting membrane potential, action potential amplitude, or the maximum rate of depolarization were 
noted. The sensitivity of these in vitro assays was confirmed by the appropriate positive controls.  
Alogliptin had no effect on body temperature, heart rate, blood pressure (systolic, diastolic, and mean 
arterial pressure), or electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters (PR or RR intervals, QRS duration, QT interval 
or corrected QT interval [QTc] value) in telemetrized beagle dogs given oral gavage doses of up to 25 
mg/kg. No alogliptin-related cardiovascular effects were noted in dogs in the repeat-dose toxicity studies 
at oral doses of up to 200 mg/kg/day for up to 39 weeks.  
Alogliptin did not affect cardiac troponin (I or T isoform) concentrations in dogs. The 200 mg/kg/day dose 
to beagle dogs for 26 weeks provides an estimated exposure margin of alogliptin, based on area under the 
plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC(0-24)), of approximately 227-fold higher 
than the clinical dose of 25 mg/day.  
Respiratory function of rats administered a single oral dose of 10 to 100 mg/kg alogliptin was unaffected. 
2.3.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Because T2DM is a progressive disease, combination therapies are used to achieve better glycemic 
control. Combination treatment with alogliptin, which stimulates insulin secretion, and pioglitazone, 
which enhances insulin sensitivity or with alogliptin and glibenclamide, which enhances insulin secretion, 
could augment their effects on glycemic control. Similarly, combination treatment with alogliptin and 
metformin or alogliptin and voglibose, therapeutic agents that affect intestinal glucose absorption, may 
provide better efficacy than treatment with either agent alone.  
Combined treatment with alogliptin and pioglitazone to db/db mice resulted in additive decreases in 
plasma GHb levels, plasma triglyceride (TG) levels, plasma nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels, and 
plasma glucose area under the plasma concentration time curve (AUC) values, and an additive increase 
in the insulinogenic index. This treatment synergistically decreased plasma glucose and synergistically 
increased pancreatic insulin content and, immunohistochemical analyses of pancreatic tissues revealed 
intense expression of insulinlike immunoreactivity (IR), normal β-cell/α-cell distributions, and overall 
expression of insulin promoter transcription factor (pdx-1)-like IR. Combined treatment with alogliptin 
and pioglitazone in ob/ob mice additively decreased GHb, fed and fasting plasma glucose levels, and 
plasma NEFA and additively increased plasma insulin, fed and fasting plasma/insulin glucose ratios, and 
pancreatic insulin content. Additionally, treatment with alogliptin alone or in combination with 
pioglitazone decreased plasma glucagon levels.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 15/96 
 
 
  
 
Combination treatment with alogliptin and glibenclamide to N-STZ-1.5 rats additively decreased plasma 
glucose levels and additively increased plasma insulin levels.  
Combined treatment with alogliptin and voglibose to db/db mice additively decreased plasma DPP-4 
activity, synergistically increased plasma intact GLP-1 levels and pancreatic insulin content, and 
additively prevented deterioration of glycemic control while additively preserving plasma insulin levels. 
Immunohistochemical analyses of the pancreatic tissue from these mice showed that combination 
treatment with alogliptin and voglibose effectively preserved islet architecture and islet cell composition 
in db/db mice. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
2.3.3.1.  Performed studies 
The pharmacokinetics of alogliptin were determined after oral or IV administration to rats, dogs and 
cynomolgus monkeys. The disposition of 14C-alogliptin was studied in rats and dogs. Plasma protein 
binding in mouse, rat, dog and human plasma was determined in vitro, and tissue distribution (including 
distribution to the eyeball and the placenta) of 14C-alogliptin was evaluated in rats. The absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, and excretion of alogliptin and its metabolites were studied in rats and dogs. 
The biotransformation of alogliptin was investigated extensively in vitro and in vivo in rats and dogs. A 
milk excretion study was also conducted in rats. Non-clinical pharmacokinetic and metabolism studies 
used formulations that were similar, or identical, to those used in toxicology and pharmacodynamic 
studies. 
The kinetics of alogliptin were also investigated when co-administered with pioglitazone and metformin. 
The effect on the kinetics of the combination of alogliptin with sulphonylurea or triple therapies was not 
investigated in the pre-clinical species. 
Validated LC-MS-MS methods having acceptable linear range, LLOQ, intra assay accuracy and precision 
were used to analyse Alogliptin, Alogliptin M-I and Alogliptin M-II in mouse plasma, rat plasma, rat fetal 
serum, rat milk, rabbit plasma, dog plasma or monkey plasma. Acceptable and validated methods were 
also developed for analysis of (S)-alogliptin in rat and dog plasma. 
For LC/MS/MS assays, alogliptin-d4 TFA salt and M-I-d4 were used as the internal standards for 
quantitation of alogliptin and M-I. 
For rat metabolism studies, a bioanalytical method based on HPLC with liquid scintillation detection and 
counting of radioactivity was used. 
2.3.3.2.  Absorption  
Caco-2 permeability 
Alogliptin has low permeability as the apparent permeability (Papp) coefficients were comparable to those 
of mannitol, which is a reference compound for low permeable compounds. The Papp ratios were different 
at each time point (1 and 2 hours) and were relatively low compared with those of digoxin. Therefore, the 
involvement of P-glycoprotein in the transport of alogliptin was not clear in a Caco-2 assay but expected 
to be limited.  
Single-dose pharmacokinetics 
The single-dose pharmacokinetics of alogliptin was studied in rats, dogs, monkeys and humans via PO 
and IV routes of administration. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 16/96 
 
 
  
 
Alogliptin was absorbed in rats, dogs and monkeys following PO dose administration. The oral 
bioavailability of alogliptin in the non-clinical species evaluated differed across species 41-45% in rats, 
69-85% in dogs and 72-88% in monkeys. Studies with radiolabeled alogliptin benzoate showed an oral 
absorption ratio of 61.1% in rats and 88.6% in dogs based on AUC0-24hr values. In rats, ~30% of the dose 
radioactivity was absorbed via the jejunal loop within 2 hours after administration of 14C-alogliptin 
benzoate (3 mg freebase/kg) into the jejunal loop suggesting that the jejunum is one of the major 
absorption sites in rats.  
Alogliptin was poorly absorbed (<0.1% at 24 hours post-dose) via the lymph after a single PO 
administration of 3 mg free base/kg radiolabeled alogliptin to rats.  
The terminal elimination half-life (T½) of alogliptin after IV administration was a little bit shorter in rats 
and dogs (1.1-1.4 hours and 1.5-2.9 hours, respectively) when compared to monkeys (5.7 hours). In 
studies with PO (3 mg/kg) or IV (1 mg/kg) administered 14C-alogliptin, the half-life of the measured 
radioactivity was found to be 4.9 and 3.4 hours after oral and IV dosing, respectively, in rats and 6.7 and 
5.3 hours, respectively, in dogs. The volume of distribution of alogliptin after IV dosing was ~2.6 – 3.9 
L/kg in all pre-clinical species used. Plasma clearance values were higher in rats (~3.0 – 3.3 L/kg/hr) and 
dogs (~1.3 – 2.4 L/kg/hr) than in monkeys (~0.5 L/kg/hr). 
After a single PO administration of alogliptin benzoate in male rats and dogs, Cmax and AUC0-24hr values 
increased dose-proportional between 0.3 to 3 mg/kg in dogs, and more than dose-proportional between 
3 to 30 mg/kg in dogs and between 3 to 100 mg/kg in rats.  Tmax and T½ values were generally constant 
over the tested dose range, but in dogs T½ was lower (~2-fold) at 0.3 mg/kg and Tmax higher (~3-fold) 
at 30 mg/kg compared to the other doses tested. 
Among the several salts of alogliptin that were evaluated, the benzoate salt showed the best 
bioavailability in rats and dogs. Therefore, it was selected for toxicity studies.  
Repeated-dose pharmacokinetics of alogliptin and its metabolites (M-I & M-II)  
The repeated-dose pharmaco- and toxicokinetics of alogliptin were determined after repeated PO dosing 
in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys. Alogliptin was rapidly absorbed in all species studies.   
In mice and monkeys, exposure to alogliptin was generally dose-proportional. For male mice, the 
exposure was higher than expected at the 200 mg/kg dose leading to dose non-proportionality on visual 
inspection, which was the result of the high, but largely variable plasma concentrations at 8 hours and 12 
hours post-dose on Day 1 and Day 90, respectively. In rats and dogs, the increase in alogliptin exposure 
was more than dose-proportional. In addition, there was an increase in T½ at increasing dose in rats. 
In general, no significant accumulation of alogliptin was observed in mice and monkeys after repeated 
dosing with alogliptin. In rats, accumulation of alogliptin was observed with accumulation ratios mostly in 
the range of 1.7-2.8. In dogs, a slight accumulation was seen for alogliptin after repeated dosing with 
accumulation ratios ranging between 1.1 and 1.7.  
As only up to 1% of alogliptin will be present in vivo as [S]-alogliptin, its pharmaco- and toxicokinetics will 
not influence the pharmacological effects of alogliptin. 
Less than ~3.2% of alogliptin was converted to M-I in mice at all dose levels when the AUC values were 
compared and decreased with increasing dosages. On the other hand, in rats, the metabolite-to-parent 
ratio (in %) was maximally 33.8% with lower contribution of the metabolite to total exposure at 
increasing dosage. The elimination of M-I in rats seemed to be saturable since its T½ increased with 
increasing dose. Following a low oral dose of 10 mg/kg alogliptin, the 24-hour total exposure to M-I was 
76 and 85% of that to the parent drug in female and male dogs, respectively. With increasing dose, the 
contribution of the metabolite exposure decreased (to 20-40%). A saturable formation of the metabolite 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 17/96 
 
 
  
 
may be responsible for the decrease of M-I contribution with increasing dose. The 24-hour total exposure 
to M-I in monkeys was 11 and 12.6% of that to the parent drug for females and males, respectively, at the 
low dose and decreased to 2.5 and 1.6%, respectively, at the high dose suggesting saturation of 
metabolism. 
No significant accumulation of M-I was observed in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after oral repeated 
dosing with alogliptin.  
In all species for which data on M-II was present, AUC0-24hr values showed that M-II was only formed to 
a small extent: 0.5% in monkeys and <3% in rats. In rats, slight accumulation occurred at all dose levels 
except at 400 mg/kg/day in male rats with accumulation ratios up to ~2.6. In monkey, no accumulation 
of M-II was observed. 
Repeated-dose pharmacokinetics in pregnant animals 
Pregnancy had an impact on total exposure of alogliptin in pregnant rats and rabbits leading to differences 
in exposure to alogliptin and alogliptin metabolites most likely due to increases in distribution volume and 
differences in elimination. 
After oral dosing with 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg in pregnant rats, Tmax and systemic exposure of alogliptin 
were generally higher on gestation day (GD) 17 compared to GD6. Plasma half-life was generally ~2.2 to 
4 hours, but was ~49 hours at the highest dose on GD6 and not determinable on GD17. 
In pregnant rabbits, exposures were slightly lower on GD6 than on GD18 at doses of 100 and 200 mg/kg 
but comparable at higher doses of 500 and 700 mg/kg which may indicate less absorption at the late 
stage of gestation for higher doses. 
Repeated-dose pharmacokinetics in juveniles 
The toxicokinetic effects of alogliptin in juvenile rats were assessed in an oral 4-week and 8-week toxicity 
study with dose levels of 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg. AUC0-24hr values for alogliptin and M-II increased more 
than dose-proportional with increases in dose and AUC0-24hr values for M-I less than dose-proportional 
with dose, and tended to increase with repeated doses (up to max. ~3-fold). 
Pharmacokinetics when concomitantly administered with metformin or pioglitazone 
The combination treatment of alogliptin and metformin was investigated in one single-dose study and in 
two repeated-dose toxicity studies of 4 and 13 weeks, respectively. No effects on the toxicokinetics of 
metformin were observed when co-administered with alogliptin. The effects of concomitant treatment 
with alogliptin and pioglitazone on the toxicokinetic parameters of both compounds were assessed in a 
single-dose and two repeated-dose studies for 4 weeks and 13 Weeks, respectively. These studies 
showed no toxicokinetic interactions regarding the kinetic parameters of alogliptin. 
2.3.3.3.  Distribution 
Protein binding 
In vitro plasma protein binding of alogliptin was studied in mice, rats, dogs and humans. The results 
indicate that alogliptin has low protein binding (<60% in all species) and was concentration dependent. 
Plasma protein binding of M-I was also low (<40% in all species). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013

Red blood cell partitioning 
Following PO administration of 3 mg free base/kg 14C-alogliptin benzoate to rats, concentrations of 
radioactivity in red blood cells were 35% to 41% and were almost constant from 1 to 24 hours post-dose. 
In dogs, the distribution ratio of radioactivity into blood cells constantly decreased from 1 to 8 hours 
post-dose from 38% to 23% when dosed with 3 mg free base/kg 14C-alogliptin. 
Tissue distribution 
Distribution was studied in rats following PO administration of a single dose of 14C-alogliptin benzoate (3 
mg freebase/kg) to male albino and male pigmented rats. Radioactivity was absorbed rapidly with most 
matrices reaching Cmax at 4 hours post dose. In albino rats, the tissues with the highest mean Cmax 
values at 4 hours, excluding the gastrointestinal (GI) tract tissues, were kidneys, liver, lungs, pituitary 
gland, and submaxillary glands. The tissues with the lowest Cmax values were brain and spinal cord. By 
72 hours post dose, concentrations of radioactivity were low in all tissues except the kidneys. 
In pigmented rats, the concentrations of radioactivity in the plasma showed a similar profile to that in 
albino rats. The concentrations of radioactivity in the eyes of pigmented rats, however, were much higher 
than those in the eyes of albino rats. These results suggest that alogliptin-related materials have an 
affinity to melanin and Alogliptin accounted for most of the residual radioactivity in sclera of pigmented 
rats after a single PO administration of 14C-alogliptin benzoate. 
Placental transfer 
On gestation day (GD) 18, pregnant rats were administered 14C-alogliptin benzoate (3 mg free base/kg) 
via PO (322-00246). Radioactivity was quickly absorbed and Cmax was reached at 4 hours. The Cmax of 
total radioactivity in fetal tissues (136 ng equiv/g) was lower than the corresponding value in maternal 
plasma (191 ng equiv/g). The Cmax of total radioactivity in placenta was higher (639 ng equiv/g) than that 
in maternal plasma. 
Elimination of total radioactivity in fetal plasma, amniotic fluid, and fetal tissues was rapid (0.004, 0.002, 
0.003 ng equiv/g at 24 hours post-dose, respectively). The concentration-time profiles of radioactivity in 
the fetuses and fetal plasma were parallel to those in the maternal plasma. The radioactivity in the 
placenta was higher than that in maternal plasma or in amniotic fluid. However, elimination of total 
radioactivity in placenta was also rapid. The concentrations of radioactivity in the fetuses and fetal plasma 
were lower than those in the maternal plasma at all the time points examined, suggesting that the 
transfer of radioactive compounds from the maternal side to the fetal side was quantitatively restricted by 
placental passage. Based on these results, it can be concluded that 14C-alogliptin-derived radioactivity is 
able to cross the blood-placental barrier. 
2.3.3.4.  Metabolism 
Alogliptin was stable in all metabolic systems investigated (human, rat, dog, and monkey cryopreserved 
hepatocytes and rat, dog, monkey, and human liver microsomes) with the exception of dog and rat 
hepatocytes (approximately 50% and 65% of the parent compound remained after 2-hour incubation 
with dog and rat hepatocytes, respectively).  
Identification of the metabolites showed that alogliptin is considered to be biotransformed to M-I by 
N-demethylation, and to M-II by acetylation of the amino group. M-I is an N-demethylated metabolite and 
a pharmacologically active metabolite with a DPP-4 inhibitory activity similar to that of alogliptin (IC50: 
14 and 10 nmol/L, respectively in human plasma). M-II is an N-acetylated metabolite and has no DPP-4 
inhibitory activity and thus a pharmacologically inactive metabolite.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 19/96 
 
 
  
 
Both M-I and M-II are minor human metabolites with an exposure to these 2 identified minor metabolites 
in plasma, relative to unchanged drug, of <1% and <6%, respectively. All metabolites found in humans 
were also found in rats and dogs and there are thus no unique human metabolites of alogliptin. 
When the exposure to M-I was compared following oral (gavage) administration of alogliptin to Sprague 
Dawley rats, beagle dogs and monkeys during a 28-day toxicity study Cmax levels of M-I were found to 
be much higher in dogs (day 26) as compared to rats (day 28) and monkeys (day 1). 
The in vivo chiral conversion of [R]-alogliptin to [S]-alogliptin was negligible (<1%) in rats and dogs in 
both plasma and urine samples. 
2.3.3.5.  Excretion 
Following PO administration of 14C-alogliptin benzoate to rats and dogs, the major route of elimination of 
total radioactivity was via the feces in both species. 
In rat alogliptin and M-I were the major components in the urine and feces, M-II was a minor component 
in feces. A study to evaluate the potential enterohepatic recirculation of alogliptin indicated that 
alogliptin-related radioactivity undergoes some enterohepatic recirculation in rats. In dogs alogliptin and 
M-I were the major components in urine and feces and M-II was not detected. 
After PO administration of 14C-alogliptin benzoate (3 mg freebase/kg) to lactating rats on Lactation Day 
(LD) 14, the concentrations of radioactivity in the plasma reached a maximum of 0.170 μg equiv/mL at 
0.5 hours post dose and rapidly decreased to 0.006 μg equiv/mL at 24 hours post dose, followed by a 
gradual decrease to 0.003 μg equiv/mL 48 hours postdose. The concentrations of radioactivity in the milk 
reached a maximum of 0.316 μg equiv/mL at 0.5 hours postdose and rapidly decreased to 0.012 μg 
equiv/mL at 24 hours postdose, followed by a gradual decrease to 0.003 μg equiv/mL at 48 hours 
postdose. These results indicate that alogliptin and its related compounds were secreted into the milk of 
lactating rats after a single PO administration of 14C-alogliptin benzoate. 
2.3.3.6.  Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
In vitro, alogliptin is a weak direct CYP2D6 inhibitor at concentrations ≥40 µM (=~14 µg/mL). 
Metabolism-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4/5 was observed for alogliptin with an IC50 value of 78 µM 
(=~26 µg/mL). These concentrations are however much higher than the human Cmax of 0.483 µg/mL 
reached after a 100 mg dose, which is four times higher than the clinical recommended dose of 25 mg. 
Therefore, alogliptin is not expected to be an inhibitor of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5 in vivo in humans as is 
underlined by the results of the clinical drug-drug interaction study with midazolam (CYP3A4) and 
dextromorphan (CYP2D6). CYPs 1A2, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 were not inhibited in vitro by alogliptin as is 
supported by the observation that alogliptin does not interact with rosiglitazone, glyburide or glipizide. 
Induction of CYP enzymes by alogliptin was only observed for CYP3A4/5 at a concentration of 100 µM 
based on testosterone 6ß-hydroxylase activity, although this was not statistically significant. However, 
the induction potential was about a fourth of the effectiveness of the known inducer rifampin, and no 
induction was observed clinically. Therefore, no CYP induction is expected in humans. 
The applicant investigated if alogliptin is an in vitro inhibitor of OAT1, OAT3 and OCT2. The study included 
both control cells and cells transfected with the specific transporter of interest. Further, the used probe 
substrates (PAH, E3S and metformin) and positive control inhibitors (probenecid, probenecid and 
quinidine) are appropriate. No clinically relevant inhibition by alogliptin (based on its Cmax of 0.3 µM) was 
seen for any of the investigated transporters. 
The inhibitory effect of alogliptin on BCRP was examined using BCRP expressed cells. After incubation of 
[3H]prazosin (0.01 μmol/L), a substrate for BCRP, at 37°C with alogliptin at concentrations of 0, 0.3, 1, 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 20/96 
 
 
  
 
3, 10, 30, and 100 μmol/L, the Papp ratios of [3H]prazosin (0.01 μmol/L) were 12.5, 12.6, 11.2, 12.0, 
10.6, 12.8, and 11.9×10–6 cm/sec across the BCRP-expressing cells, and were 1.3, 1.3, 1.2, 1.3, 1.2, 
1.3, and 1.3×10–6 cm/sec across the control cells, respectively. The corrected Papp ratios were 9.6, 9.7, 
9.3, 9.2, 8.8, 9.8, and 9.2, respectively. These results suggest that alogliptin had no inhibitory effect on 
BCRP-mediated efflux activity. Therefore, alogliptin is not an inhibitor of BCRP. 
No in vitro studies were performed with MATE and OATP. A clinical study was performed to study the 
interaction potential between alogliptin and cyclosporine (inhibitor of OATP1B1/OATP1B3, BCRP and 
P-glycoprotein). Whether alogliptin is a substrate and/or an inhibitor of MATE1 and MATE2 was 
investigated in a clinical study in healthy volunteers with cimetidine and metformin. (Please see clinical 
pharmacology section for further details) 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The safety of alogliptin has been investigated in a battery of nonclinical toxicity studies including single- 
and repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice, rats, and dogs, reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits, 
and in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies. Two-year carcinogenicity studies were conducted in mice and 
rats. Repeat-dose toxicity studies were also conducted in juvenile rats (4 weeks of age at dose initiation), 
including one study specifically aimed at evaluating the possible toxicity on male reproductive organs. 
Local tolerance studies assessing the hemocompatibility of a parenteral formulation of alogliptin in human 
blood/plasma and the IV and paravenous tolerance of alogliptin were performed in rabbits. Special 
toxicity studies (4- and 13-week) were conducted in monkeys to evaluate the potential dermal toxicity of 
alogliptin. The potential of alogliptin to induce phototoxicity was evaluated in a hairless mouse model. 
In addition repeat-dose toxicity studies (4- and 13 week) in rats and an embryo-fetal development 
toxicity study in rats were conducted to assess the toxicity of combination treatments with alogliptin and 
pioglitazone and with alogliptin and metformin. 
2.3.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
The lethal single oral and IV doses of alogliptin in rats were greater than 1471 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg, 
respectively. The lethal single oral dose in dogs was greater than 368 mg/kg. There were no sex-related 
differences in the single-dose toxicity of alogliptin. Clinical signs were observed in dogs only. Reddened 
skin around the ears and face were observed in males following oral doses of ≥92 mg/kg and in females 
at ≥221 mg/kg. Warm to touch and/or decreased activity were observed at doses of ≥221 mg/kg. A female 
dosed with 368 mg/kg also exhibited swelling around the face, skin cold to touch, salivation, and emesis; 
this female also lost weight during the 2-week post dose observation period. 
2.3.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Low toxicity was showed for mice, with a NOAEL of about 50 times the intended human exposure based 
on AUC. In mice, several deaths occurred in the repeat-dose toxicity studies. Although pathologic 
examinations could not confirm the exact cause of these deaths, the incidence increased dose 
dependently at doses of 400 mg/kg/day and higher. Alogliptin-related observations were noted in male 
mice and included yellow discoloured fur and unkempt appearance at 200 mg/kg/day and higher, and 
swelling in the anogenital area at 400 mg/kg/day and higher. Decreased RBC, HCT, and HGB were also 
noted at 600 mg/kg/day. 
Most important alogliptin-related histopathologic findings in rats were noted in the liver, kidneys, and 
urinary bladder. Increased ALP, increased liver weights, and centrilobular hepatocellular hypertrophy 
were noted in rats administered doses of ≥900 mg/kg/day. With the exception of increased liver weights, 
liver-related findings were fully reversible. Mortality was observed in rats administered repeat doses of 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 21/96 
 
 
  
 
≥1000 mg/kg/day. The The clinical pathologic findings observed included increased WBC, LYM, RET, or 
MON and decreased RBC, HCT, and HGB at 900 mg/kg/day and higher, and increased phosphorus and 
cholesterol at 1000 mg/kg/day and higher. Decreased ALB and A/G (albumin/globulin) ratio were also 
observed at 1333 mg/kg/day and higher. NOAEL for 6 months exposure was 400 mg/kg/day, which is 
about 50 – 150 times the intended human exposure. 
In the repeat-dose toxicity studies in dogs, occasional and transient occurrences of reddened ears and 
facial swelling without associated histopathologic changes were observed at doses of 30 mg/kg/day and 
higher. In the 39-week repeat-dose toxicity study, dogs administered 200 mg/kg/day (highest dose 
evaluated) lost weight during the first month of the treatment period; these losses resulted in a decrease 
in mean body weight during the treatment period. The overall NOAEL in dogs was 200 mg/kg/day; at this 
dose, the AUC(0-24) was 400 µg·hr/mL (combined sexes). 
The effects of concomitant treatment with alogliptin and pioglitazone on the toxicokinetic parameters of 
both compounds were assessed in a single-dose and two repeated-dose studies for 4 weeks and 13 
Weeks, respectively. These studies showed no toxicokinetic interactions regarding the kinetic parameters 
of alogliptin. In addition, the incidence and magnitude of the findings seen in rats administered alogliptin 
and pioglitazone in combination for 13 weeks were comparable to rats that received pioglitazone alone. 
Combination treatment with alogliptin and pioglitazone did not produce new toxicities, and did not 
exacerbate any pioglitazone-related findings. 
2.3.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
Alogliptin was evaluated for its potential to induce reverse mutations in S typhimurium and E coli, its 
mutagenic potential in vitro in L5178Y/TK+/- mouse lymphoma cells, and its mutagenic potential in vivo 
in a mouse bone marrow micronucleus study. Where appropriate, positive controls were used to confirm 
the sensitivity of the assay. Based on the results of these studies, alogliptin does not pose a mutagenic or 
clastogenic risk to humans. 
2.3.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
Alogliptin was shown to be not oncogenic or carcinogenic in mice, and the NOAEL of the 2-year 
carcinogenicity study was 300 mg/kg/day. Slightly, statistically non-significant, increased incidence in 
malignant lymphoma in female mice was observed at doses of 150 mg/kg/day when compared with 
historical control data. 
In rats, a slight, statistical non-significant increase in the incidence of thyroid C-cell tumours was noted in 
males at ≥400 mg/kg/day. This was weakly supported by increments of adenomas and hyperplasia. 
However, the incidence of these findings in this study was within the variability suggested by the historical 
control. Moreover, a rodent-specific mechanism through increased calcitonin release has been suggested 
for increases in C-cell tumours seen for GLP1 analogues (Knudsen et.al. Endocrinology 151:1473-86). 
Therefore, a weak increase in C-cell tumours after alogliptin treatment could be explained by the indirect 
impact on GLP1 levels following the administration of this DPP4 inhibitor. 
Minimal to mild simple transitional cell hyperplasia in the urinary bladder was noted in 2, 6, 10, and 14 
males at 0, 75, 400, and 800 mg/kg/day, respectively. In the male historical control series, simple 
transitional cell hyperplasia in the urinary bladder was reported for several studies and was seen in 6/60 
males in one study. NOAEL for simple transitional cell hyperplasia in the urinary bladder was considered 
to be 75 mg (males) and 400 mg (females)/kg/day. 
Also, alogliptin-related non-neoplastic histopathologic changes were seen in the liver, lung, and urinary 
bladder of males and females, and in the testes, epididymides, and prostate of males. The NOAEL for 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 22/96 
 
 
  
 
nonneoplastic changes was 75 mg/kg/day for males and 400 mg/kg/day for females. The safety factors 
based on AUC are about 25 and >200 respectively. 
2.3.4.5.  Reproduction Toxicity 
In a rat fertility study with dose levels of 0, 100, 500, 1000 mg/kg bw/day, maternal toxicity was 
observed at 500-1000 mg/kg/day, and paternal toxicity at 100 – 1000 mg/kg/day. In male rats, dose 
related increase of absolute and relative cauda epididymis weight, relative epididymis weight, relative 
weight of seminal vesicle with coagulating glands and relative testes weight and an increased % of 
abnormal sperm were observed, however, without any effect on fertility. At the highest dose of 1000 
mg/kg increased post implantation loss and decreased number of viable foetuses occurred. 
Two embryo-foetal developmental reproduction toxicity studies were done, one in rats and one in rabbits. 
In rats, doses 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day induced maternal toxicity and foetal toxicity. It is likely that 
the foetal toxicity (bent ribs, decreased ossification) was secondary to the maternal effects (decreased 
food consumption and gravid uterine weight change). In rabbits, high doses resulted in maternal deaths 
(highest doses) and toxicity signs (lower food consumption and body weight and body weight and gravid 
uterine weight). The only observed foetal effect was decreased number of viable foetuses in the only 
surviving doe at the highest dose level, which can be considered a consequence of maternal toxicity. 
An embryo-foetal developmental toxicity study in rats was also done with the combination of alogliptin 
with pioglitazone. The combination only showed a slight potentiation of foetal growth inhibition. 
A pre/postnatal developmental study in rats revealed maternal toxicity in the form of decreased gestation 
body weights, gestation body weight changes, lactation body weight, food consumption during lactation 
at doses of 500 – 1000 mg/kg/day. At 1000 mg/kg, developmental toxicity was found, consisting of 
increased stillborn index, decreased pup viability and effects on motor activity, learning, memory in F1 
males. At 500-1000 mg/kg/day, decreased pup body weight was observed up to PND28 and through 
pre/post mating of F1. 
A dose range-finding embryo-fetal toxicity study was conducted in rats at doses of up to 100/2000 
mg/kg/day (alogliptin/metformin).Based on the range-finding study, the highest dose evaluated in the 
definitive embryo-fetal developmental toxicity study in rats was 100/500 mg/kg/day. In this study, 5 
abnormal fetuses were observed from dams administered 100/500 mg/kg/day (alogliptin/metformin). 
Four of the fetuses were from a single litter: 3 of the 4 fetuses had microphthalmia and the 4th fetus had 
a misshapen tail and absent sacral vertebra. The fifth fetus, from a second litter, had multiple 
abnormalities (microphthalmia, cleft palate, microglossia, and mandibular micrognathia). No 
treatment-related fetal abnormalities occurred following concomitant treatment with 100/150 mg/kg/day 
alogliptin/metformin or when either alogliptin or metformin was administered alone. 
Two rat juvenile toxicity studies were performed, one with a treatment duration of 4 weeks and one with 
a treatment duration of 8 weeks, both with the same dose levels of 30, 100 and  300 mg/kg/day. In the 
4-week study some slight effects were found on haematological and blood/urinary chemistry and slight 
hepatocyte hypertrophy, but these changes were not considered toxicologically significant and were not 
replicated in the second longer study. 
2.3.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
Systemic exposure and maximum plasma concentrations increased generally more than 
dose-proportional in rats and dogs, except at low doses (0.3 to 3 mg/kg) in dogs over which dose range 
the kinetics were linear. This was observed both after single and repeated dosing to which saturation of 
metabolic pathways may be contributing in these species. An increase in elimination half-life and the 
less-than-dose-proportional increase in the exposure to M-I (and M-II) with increasing alogliptin doses 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 23/96 
 
 
  
 
support the idea of saturable metabolism. In mice and monkeys, exposure to alogliptin was generally 
dose-proportional where exposure to M-I was less than dose-proportional. 
The formation of the pharmacologically active metabolite M-I differed across the non-clinical species: 
total 24-hour exposure to M-I was <3.2%, <34%, <85% and 13% of respective of alogliptin exposure in 
mice, rats, dogs and monkeys, respectively, with decreasing M-I contribution to total exposure with 
increasing dose. The formation of M-I is thus saturable. However, as M-I is pharmacologically active with 
a similar mode of action as alogliptin, the systemic exposures of both compounds need to be added up in 
the pre-clinical species for determining the total exposure to active substance in vivo. 
2.3.4.7.  Local Tolerance  
A parenteral formulation of alogliptin in physiological saline was not hemolytic in human blood and did not 
cause any macroscopic flocculation, precipitation, or coagulation in human plasma. A 2.5 mg/mL solution 
of alogliptin in physiological saline was well tolerated following IV or paravenous injection to rabbits. 
2.3.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
2.3.4.8.1.  Immunotoxicity 
Non-clinical studies assessing immunotoxicity, including in vitro assessments for immune function and 
immunophenotyping of leukocyte populations, were not conducted with alogliptin. No evidence of 
drug-induced immunosuppression or enhancement were seen in the nonclinical toxicity studies with 
alogliptin. 
2.3.4.8.2.  Phototoxicity 
Although alogliptin has been shown to bind to melanin in the eyes of pigmented rats, it only has minor or 
negligibly low absorbance in the ultraviolet B (UVB) range of 290 to 320 nm and the ultraviolet A (UVA) 
range of 320 nm and longer, and single doses of up to 800 mg/kg (a dose that exceeded the 
maximum-tolerated dose [MTD]) did not produce cutaneous phototoxicity in hairless mice. The positive 
control (lomefloxacin HCl) produced the expected response (erythema, edema, and flaking). 
2.3.4.8.3.  Dermal toxicity 
Repeated doses of up to 30 mg/kg/day administered to cynomolgus monkeys for 4 and 13 consecutive 
weeks did not produce alogliptin-related dermal toxicity. No alogliptin-related lesions were seen 
histopathologically in sections of skin obtained from the thoracic region, tail, left fore- and hindlimbs, left 
auricle, nasal area, and scrotum. The NOAEL was the highest dose evaluated (30 mg/kg/day). In the 
13-week study, the mean AUC(0-24) at the NOAEL was 47 μg·hr/mL. This plasma concentration provides 
an exposure margin of approximately 27-fold higher than the clinical dose of 25 mg/day. 
2.3.4.8.4.  Dependence 
Abuse liability studies were not conducted with alogliptin. Although alogliptin inhibited naloxone binding 
at nonselective opioid receptors in vitro in the rat cerebral cortex, it did not show any binding affinity for 
human receptors typically associated with abuse potential. Additionally, no noteworthy alogliptin-related 
effects on general behavior and activity were observed in rats at doses of up to 300 mg/kg/day for 4 
consecutive weeks. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 24/96 
 
 
  
 
2.3.4.8.5.  Metabolites 
When plasma profiles were evaluated, humans were primarily exposed to alogliptin and exposure to M-I 
was minimal. The plasma metabolic profiles of mice, rats, dogs, and monkeys were broadly similar to that 
of humans except that a very low level of M-II was found in dog plasma. Based on current guidelines, both 
M-I and M-II are classified as minor human metabolites, since they account for plasma levels of less than 
10 percent of systemic exposure in humans. No extra toxicological studies on metabolites have been 
performed. 
2.3.4.8.6.  Studies on impurities 
Impurities measured in the alogliptin drug substance and drug product are below the Qualification 
Thresholds specified in ICH guidances Q3A and Q3B; therefore, toxicity studies with the individual 
impurities are not required . The impurity profiles of alogliptin drug substance used in the pivotal toxicity 
studies, and for alogliptin, pioglitazone, and metformin drug substances used in the pivotal combination 
toxicity studies were comparable to the impurity profiles for the drug substances used in the clinical 
formulations. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
2.3.5.1.  Phase I 
The applicant has submitted an ERA for Vipidia. Alogliptin is a dissociating molecule, the amine moiety is 
deprotonated at a pKa of 8.5. The molecule becomes predominantly neutral at pH values around 10 and 
higher. The pH metric method was used to determine the apparent log P vs. pH profile. Log P is 0.6 at pH 
10, 11 and 12. Hence, log Kow of alogliptin is 0.6. This corresponds with a high water solubility (approx. 
20 g/L) and a QSAR estimate for log Kow of 0.9 (Biobyte's ClogP). 
Based on the above results alogliptin doesn’t meet the screening criterion for bioaccumulation. It can be 
concluded that both alogliptin is not qualifying for PBT (persistence, bioaccumulation, and toxicity) 
assessment.

Vipidia is indicated to improve glycaemic control in adult patients (≥ 18 years old) with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus. The recommended dose of is 25 mg alogliptin / 1700 mg metformin per patient, to be taken 
daily.  
The applicant has used the default Fpen of 0.01. The resulting PECsw is 0.125 µg/L and 7.8 µg metformin/L. 
Based on these results a Phase II assessment was considered appropriate for alogliptin. 
2.3.5.2.  Phase II, Tier A 
The applicant performed a phase II Tier A ERA for alogliptin. The results of the phase II Tier A ERA for 
alogliptin are summarized in the below table.

Alogliptin has a Kow value below the trigger for an assessment of the potential for bioconcentration. 
A risk assessment for the soil compartment was not triggered as Koc, sludge <10,000 L/kg.  
Since >10% of alogliptin shifted to sediment in the water/sediment simulation study, a Phase IIB 
assessment was triggered. However, alogliptin is not very toxic to aquatic organisms and based on the 
PECsediment and PNECsediment values derived from the equilibrium partitioning method the 
PECsediment/PNECsediment ratio indicates alogliptin is unlikely to represent a risk to the sediment 
compartment. 
In conclusion alogliptin poses an acceptable risk to sewage treatment facilities, all standard surface water 
species and groundwater.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
2.3.6.1.  Pharmacology  
The primary pharmacodynamics of alogliptin is well characterised. Alogliptin is shown to be a selective 
and potent DPP4-inhibitor, as compared to the first gliptins on the market, sitagliptin and vildagliptin. The 
R-isomer is the active one as the S-isomer is 1000-times less active. From the metabolites the M-I is also 
showing activity. From a pharmacodynamic point of view (DPP4 inhibition) the duration of action is 
relatively long, e.g. in monkeys is lasting at least 24 hours, which suggests that a once-day administration 
in humans might be sufficient. 
Not only the primary effect DPP4 inhibition has been shown in vivo, but also the resulting physiological 
consequences such as enhancement of GLP-1, and increase of insulin, and the decrease of glucose after 
a glucose infusion, supporting the use of alogliptin as an antidiabetic drug. The nonclinical data do not 
suggest any clinically relevant effects of alogliptin on immunological parameters in healthy animals. 
From a safety point of view there are no concerns about the secondary pharmacology or on the safety 
pharmacology. Over a wide range of receptors and enzymes alogliptin appears to be a specific DPP4 
inhibitor. 
Combination pharmacodynamic studies confirmed the additive and/or synergistic effects of concomitant 
treatment with alogliptin and pioglitazone, alogliptin and metformin, alogliptin and glibenclamide, and 
alogliptin and voglibose. 
2.3.6.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Kinetics of alogliptin was well investigated by the applicant.  
Alogliptin has two enantiomers of which the [R]-enantiomer is clinically relevant. Chiral conversion into 
the [S]-enantiomer hardly occurs. 
Alogliptin was well absorbed, with the jejunal loop being one of the major absorption sites, in the 
non-clinical species following oral dosing. Absorption into the lymphatic circulation hardly occurs. Oral 
bioavailability was moderate to high and differed across species.  
Kinetics of alogliptin was generally linear in mouse and monkeys and in dogs in the dose range 0.3 to 3 
mg/kg. In rats and at higher doses in dogs, kinetics were more than dose-proportional caused by 
saturation of metabolic pathways. In line with this, exposure to M-I displayed less than dose-proportional 
kinetics and its formation decreased with increasing alogliptin doses in all species.  
Alogliptin is moderately bound to plasma proteins (<60%) and widely distributed among tissues, 
including passage over the blood:testes barrier and placenta, as is expected by a high volume of 
distribution. 
Metabolism: Identification of the metabolites showed that alogliptin is considered to be biotransformed to 
M-I by N-demethylation, and to M-II by acetylation of the amino group. Alogliptin and M-I are the major 
circulating components in dog plasma at dosages of 10 mg/kg and higher.  
Alogliptin is excreted in milk from lactating rats and mainly present as unchanged parent and M-I. 
Elimination of alogliptin in rats and dogs is both by hepatic clearance and renal clearance. Enterohepatic 
circulation is also possible.  
Interactions: CYPs 2D6 and 3A4/5 were inhibited in vitro by alogliptin via direct inhibition and 
metabolism-dependent inhibition, respectively, but at concentrations much higher than the clinical Cmax. 
CYP induction by alogliptin is not found in vitro or in vivo.

EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 27/96 
 
 
  
 
In humans, alogliptin is mainly eliminated by the kidneys with some evidence of activerenal secretion. 
Therefore, the main focus of the in vitro transporter studies was in the transporters associated with renal 
clearance. 
The applicant investigated if alogliptin is an in vitro inhibitor of OAT1, OAT3 and OCT2. The study included 
both control cells and cells transfected with the specific transporter of interest. Further, the used probe 
substrates (PAH, E3S and metformin) and positive control inhibitors (probenecid, probenecid and 
quinidine) are appropriate. No clinically relevant inhibition by alogliptin (based on its Cmax of 0.3 µM) was 
seen for any of the investigated transporters. 
Alogliptin was not an in vitro inhibitor of BCRP at clinically relevant concentrations 12 µM (= 50 × 
Cmax,unbound = 50 × 0.24 µM = 12 µM) and 29.5 µM (=0.1 × dose/250 mL = 0.1 × 25 mg/250 mL = 
10 µg/mL = 29.5 µM) for liver and intestinal transporter concentrations, respectively. Therefore, clinically 
relevant interactions via BCRP inhibition by alogliptin are not expected.   
No in vitro studies were performed with MATE and OATP. Additional clinical studies investigating the 
interaction potential of alogliptin have been performed and discussed in the clinical pharmacology section 
of this report. 
Pregnancy may have an influence on alogliptin and M-I exposure as a result of saturated alogliptin and 
M-I absorption, an increase in distribution volume and/or differences in elimination. Toxicokinetics in 
juvenile rats were not different compared to kinetics in adult rats. However, using healthy juvenile rats 
may not be representative for the human situation as it may be expected that T2DM is mainly present in 
obese children. 
Co-administration with pioglitazone or metformin did not result in significant or clinically relevant 
alterations in pharmacokinetics of alogliptin, pioglitazone or metformin. Combinations with 
sulphonylurea, insulin or triple therapies were not investigated in the non-clinical species. 
2.3.6.3.  Toxicology 
Acute and repeat-dose toxicity studies showed a very low toxicity of alogliptin in mice, rats, dogs and 
monkeys, with very high safety margins of 50-200 fold. Alogliptin-related toxicity occurred in rats at 
doses of ≥ 900 mg/kg/day and the findings were generally limited to the physical appearance of the 
animals and were frequently associated with decreases in body weight. Alogliptin-related histopathologic 
findings were noted in the liver, kidneys, and urinary bladder. In dogs, occasional and transient 
occurrences of reddened ears and facial swelling, without histopathologic changes, were observed at 
doses of 30 mg/kg/day and higher. Although these effects remain unexplained, and a treatment-related 
effect cannot be ruled out, the transient nature of these findings and the lack of adaptive changes in any 
organs, suggest this may be an allergic reaction. This is not likely to be relevant for humans. Decreased 
food consumption and body weight gain occurred at 200 mg/kg/day only in the early weeks of the 
39-week study. However, these effects on body weight did not adversely affect clinical pathology, organ 
weights, or histopathologic results.   
Combination treatment with alogliptin and pioglitazone for up to 13 consecutive weeks did not produce 
unanticipated toxicities, and did not exacerbate any pioglitazone-related findings. Repeat-dose toxicity 
studies with alogliptin and metformin in rats for up to 13-weeks slightly augmented metformin-related 
effects on plasma lactic acid levels and increased the incidence of metformin-related effects in the adrenal 
gland, liver, heart, and submandibular gland (males), although it did not affect the severity of the 
changes. Because these differences were shown only at the combination of alogliptin with the high dose 
of 1000 mg/kg metformin, this is probably not of clinical relevance. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 28/96 
 
 
  
 
Alogliptin is not genotoxic and not clearly carcinogenic in rodent models. The finding of a low magnitude 
of an increased incidence of malignant lymphoma in female mice, commonly found in mice, and the lack 
of a clear immunological effect at lower dose levels, is considered most likely not relevant for humans and 
the clinical situation. A low potency of alogliptin in inducing C-cell tumours seen in the rat carcinogenicity 
study is likely not clinically relevant. A minimal to mild simple transitional cell hyperplasia in the urinary 
bladder was noted in male rats at 27-fold higher than the intended human exposure. Since no threshold 
has been defined for the possible induction of cell hyperplasia in the urinary bladder by alogliptin and 
bladder cancer has been confirmed to be associated with pioglitazone, possibly via a similar 
non-genotoxic mechanism, an interaction between alogliptin and pioglitazone cannot be excluded. 
In reproduction and developmental toxicity studies alogliptin showed at the highest tested dose an 
increase in abnormal sperm, but fertility was not affected. The major developmental toxicity seen was 
most likely secondary to maternal toxicity. In the pre-postnatal toxicity study, effects on body weight and 
neuro-behavioral development appeared to be long-lasting. Exposure at the NOAEL levels was sufficiently 
above the clinical exposure. No juvenile toxicity was seen in rats, however in these studies the highest 
dose was at the level of the NOEL in the other studies. Embryo-foetal developmental toxicity studies in 
rats were also done with the combination of alogliptin with pioglitazone and alogliptin with metformin. The 
combination with pioglitazone only showed a slight potentiation of foetal growth inhibition. 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies with alogliptin combined with metformin in rats for up to 13-weeks slightly 
augmented metformin-related effects on plasma lactic acid levels and increased the incidence of 
metformin-related effects in the adrenal gland, liver, heart, and submandibular gland (males), although 
it did not affect the severity of the changes. Because these differences were shown only at the 
combination of alogliptin with the high dose of 1000 mg/kg metformin, this is probably not of clinical 
relevance. The combination with metformin revealed teratogenic potential in small numbers of foetuses 
(microphthalmia, small eye bulge and cleft palate) at high doses. 
Based on the presented data the CHMP can conclude that alogliptin did not show any local tolerance 
effects, no phototoxicity, and in monkeys no dermal toxicity. 
No dedicated studies to investigate the imunotoxicity or dependence of alogliptin have been performed. 
The CHMP considers that no such studies are warranted since no imunological signals have been revealed 
in the extended non-clinical program and alogliptin did not show any binding affinity for human receptors 
typically associated with abuse potential.     
2.3.6.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The alogliptin PECsw value of 0.125 µg/L warranted a Phase II ERA assessment. 
A risk assessment for the soil compartment was not triggered as Koc, sludge <10,000 L/kg. However, the 
EMA guideline requests determination of adsorption constants in three soils and two sludges. The 
applicant submitted a study with adsorption data for two sludges only. Since a Phase IIB assessment is to 
be performed, adsorption data determined in soil (or sediment) should be investigated. 
Since >10% of alogliptin shifted to sediment in the water/sediment simulation study, a Phase IIB 
assessment was triggered. The applicant has performed a Phase IIB assessment using the PNECsw. This 
is not in accordance with the EMA guidance. A toxicity study with a sediment dwelling organism should be 
performed. 
In addition, the applicant only provided summarized log Kow data published in literature of low quality. 
The Q&A document (EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010) states that the log Kow should be determined 
experimentally and that a calculated value is generally not acceptable. Therefore the applicant is 
recommended to perform and submit the results of a Kow study. 
CHMP assessment report

As a result of the above considerations, the available data do not allow to conclude definitively on the 
potential risk of alogliptin to the environment. 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following studies to be performed: 
 
 
an OECD 106 study determining the adsorption constants in three soils (or sediments) 
a toxicity study with a sediment dwelling organism (OECD 218). Although alogliptin has a relatively 
high water solubility, the applicant is recommended to perform an OECD 218 (sediment spiked) 
study. This study results in mg/kg concentrations, which are needed in the sediment risk 
assessment and moreover, the OECD 308 study demonstrated that shifting of alogliptin to 
sediment occurred both rapidly and in substantial amounts. The results of the effect study with the 
sediment dwelling organism should be compared to the PECsediment.  
 
a Kow study for alogliptin 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The applicant has investigated the non-clinical properties of alogliptin sufficiently to support the 
indication applied for.  
The CHMP recommends the following studies to be performed in order to fully investigate potential risk 
of alogliptin to the environment: 
 
 
an OECD 106 study determining the adsorption constants in three soils (or sediments) 
a toxicity study with a sediment dwelling organism (OECD 218). Although alogliptin has a

spiked) study. This study results in mg/kg concentrations, which are needed in the sediment risk 
assessment and moreover, the OECD 308 study demonstrated that shifting of alogliptin to 
sediment occurred both rapidly and in substantial amounts. The results of the effect study with the 
sediment dwelling organism should be compared to the PECsediment.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Introduction  
With regard to the commercial tablets, four tablet strengths of alogliptin were developed: 3.125, 6.25, 
12.5, and 25 mg. While the 3.125 mg dose strength was developed for the purpose of dose reduction in 
patients with severe renal impairment, the 6.25 mg dose is being proposed for use in patients with severe 
renal impairment/ESRD; the 12.5 mg dose strength is for patients with moderate renal impairment; the 
registration of the 3.125 mg tablet strength is not being sought. 
Absorption  
Alogliptin is absorbed rapidly with median time to reach Cmax (Tmax) occurring approximately 1-2 hours 
after single and multiple dosing. Food does not alter the pharmacokinetics of alogliptin. The absolute 
bioavailability of alogliptin is close to 100%. Therefore, alogliptin is considered to be highly permeable. 
This is confirmed by the mass balance study in which at least 76% of the (radioactivity) is recovered in 
urine.  
Bioequivalence 
Four formulations of alogliptin were used in the clinical program. The formulation of the Phase III tablet 
that was used in the main studies and the proposed commercial tablet differed substantially. 
Bioequivalence between the alogliptin Phase III and proposed commercial tablets was established for 
both the 12.5 and 25 mg tablets (90% CI within the 80%-125% range).  Additionally the lower 
commercial tablet strengths had the same dissolution profile as the 12.5 and 25 mg tablet strengths. 
Distribution  
Protein binding of alogliptin was approximately 20% and was unaffected by renal impairment. Protein 
binding of M-I ranges from 12-32%. The volume of distribution (Vz) of alogliptin following a 12.5 mg IV 
dose was 417 L. The Vz was greater than total body water (42 L), which indicates that alogliptin is well 
distributed into tissues. The apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) at steady state was 300 L at a dose of 
25 mg alogliptin administered once daily for 14 days in patients with T2DM. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013

Metabolism 
Alogliptin is metabolized into 2 identified minor metabolites: M-I, an N-demethylated metabolite via 
CYP2D6, and M-II, an N-acetylated metabolite. CYP3A4 may also be involved in the formation of other 
unidentified minor metabolites. Exposure to these 2 metabolites in plasma, relative to unchanged drug, 
are <1% and <6%, respectively. M-I has DPP-4 inhibitory activity similar to that of alogliptin; M-II has no 
DPP-4 inhibitory activity.  
Inter-conversion: Alogliptin exists predominantly as the (R)-enantiomer (>99%) and undergoes little or 
no enantiomeric conversion to the (S)-enantiomer in vivo. The (R)-enantiomer is the active moiety, and 
is >150-fold more active against DPP-4 than the (S) enantiomer. Therefore, inter-conversion has no 
clinical implications. 
Elimination 
The overall mean recovery of radioactivity in urine + faeces was 88.5 %. Approximately 76% of orally 
administered radioactivity was excreted in urine. This confirms that the extent of oral absorption in 
humans is high (at least 76%), and that alogliptin is moderately to highly permeable. Metabolism 
represents only a small part of the elimination of alogliptin; 95% of the radioactivity recovered in urine 
and 88% of the radioactivity recovered in faeces was alogliptin. The clearance (CL) of alogliptin following 
the 12.5 mg IV dose was 14 L/hr. CL/F ranges between 15- 20 L/hr.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality has been established across the dose range of 6.25 to 800 mg.  Steady state is 
achieved after 7 days. Accumulation was ~1.4 fold. 
Variability: The intersubject variability of alogliptin ranged for the Cmax and AUC between 17-31%. The 
intrasubject variability was (<23% for Cmax and AUC values).  
Pharmacokinetics in target population: Exposure to alogliptin is similar in subjects with T2DM and healthy 
subjects.  
Special populations 
Renal impairment: Exposure to alogliptin increased with increasing severity of renal impairment. Peak 
exposure (Cmax) to alogliptin was approximately 13%, 42%, 27%, and 32% greater in subjects with 
mild, moderate, and severe  renal impairment, and subjects with ESRD, respectively, than in healthy 
subjects. Total exposure (AUC(0-inf) to alogliptin in subjects with renal impairment increased with 
decreases in renal function, and was approximately 71%, 112%, 251%, and 377% greater in subjects 
with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment, and ESRD, respectively, than in healthy subjects. No 
significant differences in Tmax for any of the renal impairment groups vs the healthy matched controls for 
each group were observed. Metabolic ratios of alogliptin to M-I in healthy subjects and in subjects with 
severe renal impairment or ESRD were similar.  
Hepatic impairment: No clinical significant differences in AUC and peak Cmax exposure to alogliptin was 
observed  in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment than in healthy subjects; therefore, no dose 
adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Classes A and B). 
Subjects with severe hepatic impairment were not evaluated. 
Gender and weight: No clinically meaningful changes in exposure related to gender, and weight were 
observed. Therefore, no dose adjustment is required. 
Age and race: Small increases in exposure related to age and race were observed, the AUC was about 
30% increased after multiple doses.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro results: Alogliptin did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 in vitro. Little or no 
direct inhibition was observed for CYP isoforms (CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4/5) in vitro. 
Alogliptin was not an in vitro inhibitor of BCRP, OAT1, OAT3 and OCT2 at clinically relevant 
concentrations. Therefore, clinically relevant interactions via BCRP, OAT1, OAT3 and OCT2 inhibition by 
alogliptin are not expected. 
Clinical results:. Clinical alogliptin drug-drug interaction studies of digoxin (a substrate of P-glycoprotein 
[P-gp]) and cyclosporine (an inhibitor of P-gp) confirmed that alogliptin is neither a substrate of P-gp, nor 
an inhibitor of P-gp.  
It can be concluded that at clinically relevant concentrations (Cmax = 0.3 µM), alogliptin is not a substrate 
or inhibitor of P glycoprotein, OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2. 
A clinical study was performed to study the interaction potential between alogliptin and cyclosporine 
(inhibitor of OATP1B1/OATP1B3, BCRP and P-glycoprotein). No clinically relevant interactions were 
observed. In addition, OATP is involved in the transport from the systemic circulation to the liver based on 
the in vivo excretion pattern most likely not relevant. However, alogliptin is mainly excreted as parent 
compound via urine and BCRP transporters are involved in the transport to urine. Based on the provided 
clinical data it cannot be concluded that alogliptin is not an inhibitor of BCRP. Since, the bioavailability of 
alogliptin is high, no clinically relevant changes in alogliptin exposure are expected if alogliptin was a 
substrate of BCRP and it was concomitantly administered with a drug that is an inhibitor of BCRP. In 
addition, since excretion via faeces is <15%, it will be unlikely that an inhibitor of BCRP could have an 
effect on the excretion of alogliptin if alogliptin would be a substrate of BCRP. 
Whether alogliptin is a substrate and/or an inhibitor of OCT1, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2 was investigated 
in a clinical study in healthy volunteers with cimetidine and metformin. Cimetidine is an inhibitor of OCT1, 
OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2. Metformin is a substrate of OCT1, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2. No clinically 
relevant effects were observed on the exposure of alogliptin, cimetidine and metformin. Therefore, no 
clinically relevant drug-drug interactions are expected for alogliptin as either a substrate or as an inhibitor 
of OCT1, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2 at current exposure levels (dose up to 100 mg once daily). 
Alogliptin and co-administrated drugs were dosed together in the studies. Based on the data presented 
there is no obvious effect of alogliptin on the tmax and subsequently on the gastric emptying of the drugs 
coadministrated with alogliptin.  
No clinically meaningful changes in exposure to a number of drugs that are metabolized by CYP isozymes 
(pioglitazone [2C8]; glyburide, tolbutamide and (S)-warfarin [2C9]; midazolam, atorvastatin, ethinyl 
estradiol, and norethindrone [3A4]; caffeine and (R)-warfarin [1A2]; dextromethorphan [2D6]), 
transported by P-glycoprotein (Pgp) (fexofenadine and digoxin) or organic cation transporter 2 (OCT2) 
(MET), or drugs that are excreted unchanged in urine (MET, cimetidine [an OCT2 inhibitor], and digoxin) 
were observed when these drugs were administered with alogliptin. 
In addition, no clinically meaningful changes in exposure to alogliptin were observed when it was 
administered with MET, cimetidine, or digoxin (drugs that are excreted renally), pioglitazone (a 2C8 
substrate), or atorvastatin (a 3A4 substrate); with drugs that inhibit CYP isozymes (ketoconazole [3A4], 
fluconazole [2C9], and gemfibrozil [2C8/9]); with Pgp or OCT2 substrates (digoxin [Pgp], MET [OCT2]) or 
inhibitors (cyclosporine [Pgp], cimetidine [OCT2]); or with a drug that is excreted primarily in the feces 
(voglibose [an α-glucosidase inhibitor]). In general, alogliptin seems to have a low potential for 
interactions with co-administered medicinal products.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamics of alogliptin were investigated in 7 PK/PD studies, including healthy volunteers, 
Japanese healthy volunteers, and subjects with T2DM. 
Study 001 was an ascending single dose study in healthy subjects, using doses from 25 mg -800 mg. 
Study CHP-001 was a single dose study including lower dosages of alogliptin (6.25 mg – 200 mg) and 
was performed in healthy Japanese subjects. 
Study 002 was a multiple dose study (25, 100 or 400 mg or placebo) in subjects with T2DM. Subjects 
received alogliptin or placebo once daily for 14 days. 
Study CHP-002 was a multiple dose study in healthy male Japanese subjects, using doses of 25 or 50 
mg alogliptin once daily for 7 days. After safety data were confirmed, subjects received alogliptin 100 mg 
once daily for 7 days. 
Study 022 investigated effects of age, race and sex on single and multiple-dose pharmacodynamics of 
alogliptin. 
Study 004 and Study 019 were QT/QTc studies. 
Mechanism of action 
Alogliptin inhibits DPP-4. DPP-4 is the primary enzyme involved in the rapid degradation of the incretin 
hormones GLP-1 and GIP. GLP-1 augments glucose-induced insulin secretion, inhibits glucagon secretion 
and hepatic glucose production, and increases glucose disposal. Based on the mechanism of action, 
DPP-4 inhibition is expected to increase active GLP-1 levels in patients with T2DM. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
DPP-4 inhibition: Based on current literature, DPP-4 inhibition of ≥80% is necessary to achieve optimal 
glucose reduction. Following single-dose administration in healthy subjects, maximum inhibition (Emax) 
was >93% for all dose groups (25, 50, 100, 200, 400, and 800 mg), with median time to Emax (Tmax) 
of 2 to 3 hours (Study 001), and >88% for all dose groups (6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg), with 
median Tmax of 1.00 to 1.25 hours [CPH-001]. Emax and Tmax for the placebo group were 12.2% and 
6 hours, respectively, in Study 001, and 16.0% and 12.5 hours, respectively, in Study CPH-001. Mean 
inhibition at 24 and 72 hours postdose (E24 and E72) ranged from 74.3% and 47.5%, respectively, for 
the 25 mg group, to 97.0% and 83.0%, respectively, for the 800 mg group in Study 001, and from 64.7% 
and 27.8%, respectively, for the 6.25 mg group, to 94.2% and 74.4%, respectively, for the 200 mg group 
in Study CPH-001. 
Following multiple-dose administration in healthy Japanese subjects [CPH-002], Emax was >95% for all 
dose groups (25, 50, and 100 mg), with Tmax of 1 hour on both Day 1 and after 7 days of once-daily 
dosing (Day 7). Emax and Tmax for the placebo group were 3.8% and 15 hours, respectively, on Day 1, 
and 4.6% and 15 hours, respectively, on Day 7. E24 ranged from 79.7% for the 25 mg group to 89.8% 
for the 100 mg group on Day 1 and from 83.5% for the 25 mg group to 92.0% for the 100 mg group on 
Day 7. 
Following multiple-dose administration in subjects with T2DM (002), Emax was >93% for all dose groups 
(25, 100, and 400 mg), with Tmax of approximately 1 hour on Day 1 and 1 to 2.5 hours after 14 days of 
once-daily dosing (Day 14). Emax and Tmax for the placebo group were 25.3% and 1.5 hours, 
respectively, on Day 1, and 20.8% and 6.5 hours, respectively, on Day 14. E24 ranged from 78.3% to 
95.7% on Day 1 and from 81.8% to 96.7% on Day 14, and E72 ranged from 66.3% to 81.6% for the 3 
alogliptin groups on Day 14.

NONMEM modeling that combined a 2-compartment, first order absorption pharmacokinetic model with 
an Emax pharmacodynamic model confirmed the potency of alogliptin as an inhibitor of DPP-4 activity 
with a predicted Emax value of 96.2% and a predicted EC50 value of 3.73 ng/mL in healthy subjects in 
Study 001 and a predicted Emax of 98.9% and a predicted EC50 value of 6.55 ng/mL in subjects with 
T2DM in Study 002. The EC80 in Study 002 was around 30 ng/mL in T2DM patients. This concentration is 
in line with the 25 mg alogliptin dose. 
The effects of age, race, and sex on the single- and multiple-dose pharmacodynamics of alogliptin alone 
was investigated in a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in healthy male 
and female subjects [Study 022].  Peak levels of mean DPP-4 inhibition were at least 92% and were 
reached by 2 hours postdose. DPP-4 inhibition 24 hours after alogliptin administration was 76±4% vs 
79±4% in young vs elderly, 77±4% vs 79±5% in men vs women, and 76±4% vs 80±4% in Black vs 
White. No relevant differences were observed between subgroups. 
GLP-1 levels: The inhibition of DPP-4 activity by alogliptin elicited prominent increases in plasma active 
GLP-1 levels in healthy subjects (this parameter was not evaluated in subjects with T2DM in the phase 1 
program), with mean changes from baseline in plasma active GLP-1 levels that were consistently greater 
in the alogliptin groups than in the placebo groups. Dose-related elevations in plasma levels of GLP-1 
persisted through 72 hours after dosing, which is consistent with continuing DPP-4 inhibition. As 
expected, the effects of alogliptin were most evident after meals when GLP-1 levels increased. 
Postprandial Glucose Concentrations: Following multiple-dose administration in subjects with T2DM 
(002), statistically significant decreases, compared with placebo, from baseline in 4-hour postprandial 
glucose concentrations were observed following each meal (breakfast, lunch, and dinner) as well as when 
averaged across all 3 meals. 
Effects on QT- time: The MAH performed one QT-study with alogliptin doses 50 mg and 400 mg. This 
study did not reveal effects of alogliptin on cardiac repolarization. Although, in the highest dose (400 mg 
alogliptin, which is 16 times the proposed dosage), the 2-sided 90% CI of the difference from placebo in 
LS mean change from baseline in QTcI interval was >10 msec at two time points (0.5 hours and 1 hour 
postdose) on Day 7, the difference from placebo at these time points for alogliptin 400 mg was 5.84 msec 
(90% CI, 1.44-10.24 msec) at 0.5 hour; and 6.60 msec (90% CI, 2.50-10.70 msec) at 1 hour postdose. 
All other measurements were within the boundary and no other signals on cardiac repolarization in clinical 
or non-clinical studies have been found, therefore alogliptin is not considered to have effects on cardiac 
repolarization in the proposed posology (25 mg). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Several studies were performed to characterize the PK and PD of alogliptin. 
The Pharmacokinetics of alogliptin is fairly uncomplicated. It is absorbed fast and almost completely, the 
maximum plasma concentration is found after 1-2 hours after administration. Bioequivalence between 
the alogliptin Phase III and proposed commercial tablets was established for both the 12.5 and 25 mg 
tablets (90% CI within the 80%-125% range).  Additionally the lower commercial tablet strengths had 
the same dissolution profile as the 12.5 and 25 mg tablet strengths. As all tablet strengths including the 
lower strengths were used in the pharmacokinetics studies and dose proportionality was sufficiently 
shown, it is agreed that the conclusion on bioequivalence can be extended to the lower 6.25 and 3.125 mg 
tablet. 
Alogliptin is mainly excreted unchanged via the urine (75%), two minor metabolites were identified: M-I, 
and M-II. The Exposure to these 2 metabolites are <1% and <6%.  M-I has DPP-4 inhibitory activity 
similar to that of alogliptin; M-II has no DPP-4 inhibitory activity. Therefore, small to moderate changes 
in exposure to these metabolites are not considered to be clinically relevant. CYP2D6 is involved in the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 36/96 
 
 
  
 
formation of these two metabolites and CYP3A4 may also be involved in the formation of other 
unidentified minor metabolites. 
In the PD-studies, alogliptin showed a dose-dependent reduction in DPP-4 levels in both healthy and 
T2DM patients. Multiple-dose of 25 mg alogliptin treatment caused a≥ 80% reduction in DPP-4 levels, 
which is considered necessary to achieve optimal glucose reduction. However, it is not known if a lower 
dose of 12.5 mg could cause a comparable clinically effect. Therefore, both 12.5 mg and 25 mg dose have 
been used in the clinical trials. 
The inhibition of DPP-4 activity by alogliptin elicited prominent increases in plasma active GLP-1 levels in 
healthy subjects, and significant decreases in 4-hour post prandial glucose concentrations in T2DM 
subjects. 
Subjects with severe hepatic impairment were not evaluated; therefore alogliptin is not recommended for 
patients with severe hepatic impairment (Class C) as stated in sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Increased exposure to alogliptin is observed in patients with renal impairment, and therefore the 
applicant proposed dose reduction in these patients. In order to assess whether the exposure to alogliptin 
in ESRD patients is acceptable, the applicant confirmed that all included patients were anuric (as a worst 
case scenario) and therefore the proposed dosing in this subgroup was acceptable for CHMP. 
The PK-study 022 showed that gender did not influence the AUC or other PK-parameters. Small increases 
in exposure related to age and race were observed, the AUC was about 30% increased after multiple 
doses of alogliptin. These changes were not considered clinically relevant since age or race had no effect 
on alogliptin inhibition of DPP-4 activity.  
However, the CHMP had concerns regarding the quality of the population PK analysis in order to be used 
for description of the effect of weight on alogliptin exposure, and requested during the procedure several 
updated data sets to assess the influence of body weight.  
The applicant provided during the procedure an updated POP-PK analysis which included pooled data from 
studies 002, 006, and 008 for a detailed evaluation of the effects of renal function (measured by 
creatinine clearance [CRCL]) and weight in kilograms [WTKG]) on the PK and exposure of alogliptin.. The 
applicant provided numerical (Bootstrap) and visual (pcVPC) diagnostics thus allowing assessment of the 
updated model. The effect of body weight in the view of the CHMP was thus well estimated and the model 
now sufficiently robust with high convergence rate and precise parameter estimates. The conclusion 
regarding the clinically insignificant effect of body weight on exposure to alogliptin was therefore accepted 
and is reflected in the text regarding the influence of body weight in SmpC section 5.2. 
The alogliptin potential for interactions appears to be low; it has been studied in vivo with all relevant 
antidiabetic drugs. Most possibly relevant CYP enzymes have been evaluated. The applicant investigated 
if alogliptin is an in vitro inhibitor of OAT1, OAT3 and OCT2. The study included both control cells and cells 
transfected with the specific transporter of interest. Further, the used probe substrates (PAH, E3S and 
metformin) and positive control inhibitors (probenecid, probenecid and quinidine) are appropriate. No 
clinically relevant inhibition by alogliptin (based on its Cmax of 0.3 µM) was seen for any of the 
investigated transporters.. Alogliptin and co-administrated drugs were dosed together in the studies. 
Based on the data presented there is no obvious effect of alogliptin on the tmax and subsequently on the 
gastric emptying of the drugs coadministrated with alogliptin.  
The ability of alogliptin to inhibit CYP2B6 (as measured by efavirenz 8-hydroxylation rates) was 
investigated with a pool of 16 individual human liver microsomal samples at concentrations ranging from 
0.1 to 100 μmol/L. The study setup of the submitted study to investigate if alogliptin is an in vitro inhibitor 
of CYP2B6 is acceptable. The marker CYP2B6 reaction efavirenz 8-hydroxylation and the CYP2B6 positive 
control inhibitors orphenadrine (750 uM) and phencyclidine (30 uM) is appropriate. No inhibition of 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 37/96 
 
 
  
 
CYP2B6 activity by alogliptin was seen up to 100 µM and subsequently the risk for alogliptin inhibition of 
CYP2B6 at clinically relevant concentrations is unlikely.Information that alogliptin is not an inhibitor of 
CYP2B6 in vitro is included in section 5.2 of the SmPC.   
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The applicant performed several clinical pharmacology studies to show the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics of alogliptin. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were sufficiently investigated 
in the view of the CHMP. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Results from the phase 1 studies suggested a dose range between 6.25 and 100 mg should be tested to 
determine optimal dosage in confirmatory clinical studies. Hence, that dose range was used in the 
phase 2 dose-ranging study (Study 003). Study 003 assessed the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of 
alogliptin 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 mg over 12 weeks compared with placebo in 265 subjects with 
T2DM, 26 to 75 years of age, inclusive, who were either receiving no treatment (ie, either newly 
diagnosed or experiencing inadequate glycaemic control with diet and exercise alone) or were being 
treated with an SU, MET, or a combination of SU and MET, but were experiencing inadequate glycaemic 
control.  
Statistically significant and clinically relevant reductions in HbA1c were observed at alogliptin doses of 
≥12.5 mg and in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) at doses of ≥25 mg, with no additional HbA1c benefit seen 
at doses >25 mg (Table 3). HbA1c levels were not significantly reduced with alogliptin 6.25 mg, which is 
likely due to lack of optimal DPP-4 inhibition.

These HbA1c and FPG results were the basis for selecting alogliptin 12.5 and 25 mg for evaluation in the 
Phase III clinical program. Both doses were chosen for further evaluation because, at that point in time, 
only limited comparative safety data were available.  
Total exposure to alogliptin in subjects with moderate and severe renal impairment/ESRD increased 
approximately 2- and 4-fold, respectively, compared with healthy matched control subjects. Dose 
reductions proportional to the increases in exposure seen in Study 006 were used in Study 402, in which

a dose of alogliptin 25 mg was assigned to T2DM subjects with normal renal function and those with mild 
renal impairment, alogliptin 12.5 mg to T2DM subjects with moderate renal impairment, and alogliptin 
6.25 mg to T2DM subjects with severe renal impairment/ESRD.  
2.5.2.  Main studies 
The clinical development program for alogliptin examined the use of alogliptin in monotherapy and in 
combination use with 4 major classes of antidiabetic agents: (1) MET (2) SU, (3) TZD, and (4) insulin. The 
efficacy of alogliptin has been evaluated in 15 studies: 1 phase 2 dose ranging study, 7 main Phase III 
studies, and 7 supportive Phase III studies (Table 2).  
The main studies in the clinical development program relevant to the evaluation of efficacy comprise 6 
completed and 1 ongoing Phase III studies. 
Methods and Study design 
Placebo controlled studies 
There were 5 main Phase III, 26-week, placebo-controlled studies that included adult subjects diagnosed 
with T2DM who failed to achieve adequate glycemic control with diet and exercise alone or on background 
antidiabetic medication (i.e. an SU, MET, TZD, or insulin). Additionally, there were 2 main long-term, 
active-comparator studies that included adult subjects diagnosed with T2DM with inadequate glycemic 
control on MET (Study 305) or MET and pioglitazone (Study 322OPI-004). 
Change from baseline in HbA1c was the primary endpoint for the main Phase III studies. Secondary 
endpoints include changes in other measures of glycemic control, including clinical response rates, FPG, 
the incidence of marked hyperglycemia, and the incidence of hyperglycemic rescue.  
Across these studies, subjects could have been naïve to treatment, previously treated with antidiabetic 
agents, or currently treated with antidiabetic agents at a stable dose, consistent with clinical practice and 
international treatment guidelines. In the add-on studies, subjects underwent a 4-week 
Run-in/Stabilization Phase during which they were stabilized on a dose of ≥1500 mg MET (or maximum 
tolerated dose [MTD]), ≥10 mg glyburide (or MTD), 30 or 45 mg pioglitazone (or MTD), or insulin (≥15 
and ≤100 units), according to protocol requirements.  
In Studies 010 (monotherapy), 007 (add-on to SU), 008 (add-on to MET), and 009 (add-on to TZD), 
doses of 12.5 and 25 mg or alogliptin were administered once daily vs placebo in a randomization ratio of 
2:2:1. An HbA1c concentration between 7.0% and 10.0%, inclusive, was used as an inclusion criterion. In 
Study 011 (add-on to insulin), doses of alogliptin 12.5 or 25 mg or placebo were administered once daily 
in a randomization ratio of 1:1:1, and a higher baseline minimum HbA1c concentration of 8.0% was used 
as an inclusion criterion.  
Although Study 009 was designed to support several indications globally evaluating alogliptin add-on 
treatment to TZD with or without MET or SU, the specific indication of add-on treatment to TZD with SU 
is not being sought in Europe. 
In the 5 main Phase III studies, the primary analysis was performed for the full analysis set (FAS) using 
an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with last observation carried forward (LOCF) values. The 
primary model included in all studies, study treatment and geographic region as class variables and 
baseline HbA1c as covariate. Additional study-specific covariates or factors were included in the primary 
analysis model. For the primary analysis, the alogliptin 25 dose was compared with placebo at the 2-sided 
0.05 significance level using a contrast derived from the primary model. Only if this test was statistically 
significant, the alogliptin 12.5 dose was to be evaluated in a similar fashion. 
Main Phase III, Long-Term, Active-Comparator Studies

Page 39/96 
 
 
  
 
In addition to the five 26-week studies, 52-week treatment has been evaluated in the 2 main Phase III, 
long-term, active-comparator studies.  
Study 305 was, at the time of evaluation of this application, an ongoing, 2-year, active-comparator study 
in which subjects are randomized to receive either alogliptin 12.5 or 25 mg or glipizide (5-20 mg) in a 
1:1:1 ratio. For this study, a baseline HbA1c of between 7.0% and 9.0% was required for inclusion. All 
subjects are to be receiving MET at a dose of ≥1500 mg (or MTD). Subjects will be treated for a period of 
2 years to assess maintenance of efficacy. An interim study report with data from a preplanned, 1-year 
interim analysis is provided. A final study report of the 104-week data for Study 305 is going to be 
available mid-2013. At the time of the CHMP opinion for this procedure, the applicant has already made 
available a summary of results and confirmed that the results are in line with the interim data formally 
assessed in this report. However, a full assessment is pending and will be carried out once a final study 
report is available. 
In Study 322OPI-004, a 52-week, active-comparator study in subjects receiving MET (≥1500 mg or 
MTD), a combination of alogliptin 25 mg and pioglitazone 30 mg once daily was compared with 
pioglitazone 45 mg once daily (randomization ratio 1:1). Subjects with an Hb1Ac of 7.0% to 10.0% were 
included in the study.  
The primary analysis in the two main active-comparator studies was a non-inferiority assessment of 
change from baseline in HbA1c. In study 305, the primary efficacy endpoint evaluated glycaemic control 
through HbA1c changes from baseline to Week 52 or Week 104. The primary efficacy endpoint for the 
interim analysis was change from baseline in HbA1c at Week 52 (or at time of discontinuation of 
double-blind study medication or hyperglycaemic rescue) using the per protocol set (PPS) and ANCOVA 
models with change from baseline (LOCF) in HbA1c as the response variable, treatment, geographic 
region, and study schedule as fixed class effects and baseline MET dose and baseline HbA1c as continuous 
covariates. The A25 group was compared with the glipizide group at the 1-sided 0.0125 level using a 
non-inferiority margin of 0.3%. If A25 was non-inferior to glipizide, then the A12.5 group was compared 
with the glipizide group in a step-down fashion using the same significance level and non-inferiority 
margin. If both alogliptin groups were non-inferior to glipizide, then additional tests for statistical 
superiority of the alogliptin groups to the glipizide group were conducted in a step-down fashion in the 
same order at the 1-sided 0.0125 level. 
In study 322OPI-004, the primary efficacy variable was change from baseline in HbA1c at Weeks 26 and 
52 in the PPS using the LOCF method for subjects who were rescued or who prematurely discontinued 
from the study. The primary model included study treatment, study schedule, and geographic region as 
class variables, and baseline MET dose and baseline HbA1c as covariates. The primary analysis was a 
non-inferiority assessment (non-inferiority margin of 0.3%) at Week 26 followed by an assessment at 
Week 52. Both analyses (at Weeks 26 and 52) were performed at the 1-sided 0.025 significance level. The 
Week 26 analysis was a pre-planned interim analysis; the Week 52 analysis was considered the primary 
endpoint. 
Supportive studies 
In the supportive studies, like the main studies, change from baseline in HbA1c was used as the primary 
endpoint. 
A 1-year study (Study 303) was performed in elderly subjects (age, 65 to 90 years) to compare alogliptin 
25 mg vs glipizide 5 mg on diet and exercise alone (Hb1Ac 6.5% to 9.0%) or on oral monotherapy (HbA1c 
6.5% to 8.0%). The glipizide dose could be up-titrated for inadequate glycemic control to 10 mg up to 
Week 12. Unlike the two main active-comparator studies, in which a non-inferiority assessment margin of 
0.3% was set, a margin of 0.4% was set for the primary analysis in Study 303.

Supportive Studies 302 and 322OPI-001 were 26-week factorial studies that examined alogliptin alone or 
in combination with MET vs MET alone in subjects on diet and exercise alone (Study 302) or alogliptin 
alone or in combination with pioglitazone vs pioglitazone alone in subjects receiving MET monotherapy 
(≥1500 mg or MTD) (Study 322OPI-001).  
An initial combination of alogliptin (12.5 or 25 mg) and pioglitazone (30 mg) was compared with alogliptin 
25 mg or pioglitazone 30 mg alone in Study 322OPI-002 over a 26-week period in subjects on diet and 
exercise alone. 
Other supportive studies include Study 301, which evaluated the effects on postprandial triglycerides of 
alogliptin 25 mg alone vs alogliptin 25 mg and pioglitazone 30 mg in combination vs placebo.  
Study 402 was, at the time of evaluation of this application,  an ongoing, long-term CV outcome study in 
subjects with T2DM and recent (within 15 to 90 days) acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Subjects were 
included with varying degrees of renal impairment. The primary endpoint in this study is the major 
adverse CV event (MACE) composite of CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), and nonfatal 
stroke. At the time of the CHMP opinion for this procedure, the clinical phase of this study has been 
already completed as the calculated number of events had been reached; a final study report is expected 
to be available in the first quarter of 2014.  
Study 012 was a long-term (4 years), open-label extension study of alogliptin (12.5 or 25 mg) once daily 
in subjects enrolled in 7 of the controlled Phase III studies. 
Study Participants  
Main Phase III, 26-Week, Placebo-Controlled Studies 
A total of 2234 subjects were randomized into the 5 studies and received at least 1 dose of study drug 
(493 received placebo, 877 received A12.5, and 864 received A25). A total of 1627 subjects completed 
and 266 discontinued from the studies. A total of 345 subjects were rescued from the studies. In all 5 
studies, a higher percentage of subjects in both the A12.5 and A25 dose groups completed the study 
compared with subjects who received placebo, which was primarily due to the greater need for 
(protocol-defined) hyperglycaemic rescue seen in placebo-treated subjects. Overall, fewer 
alogliptin-treated subjects in either dose group required hyperglycaemic rescue compared with the 
placebo group. In all 5 studies, the overall discontinuation rate for any reason was similar among both 
alogliptin doses and placebo. The percentage of subjects who withdrew voluntarily was higher in the 
alogliptin dose groups compared with the placebo group. The voluntary withdrawals in the alogliptin dose 
groups for the Phase III controlled studies were reviewed as well as the ongoing AEs for these subjects at 
the time of withdrawal. The reasons provided included moving, family illness, personal reasons, and 
conflicts with work schedules. 
No meaningful differences across treatment groups were observed for any demographic or baseline 
characteristic with respect, specifically, to sex, age, race, and body mass index (BMI)(Table 4). Mean age 
across studies ranged from 53 to 57 years (min-max, 21-80 years). In these studies, 425 (19%) 
randomized subjects were elderly (65 years), with 64 subjects (3%) at least 75 years. The majority of all 
randomized subjects were White (66.2 to 79.8%). Mean BMI for all randomized subjects ranged from 30 
to 33. The duration of T2DM differed among studies and, as expected, subjects in Study 011 (insulin 
add-on) had a longer mean duration of T2DM compared with the other studies. Duration of T2DM ranged 
from a mean of 2.82 years in the monotherapy study (010) to 13.42 years in the insulin add-on study 
(011).

Main Phase III, Long-Term, Active-Comparator Studies 
A total of 3441 subjects were randomized into the 2 studies. Of the 2638 subjects randomized into Study 
305, a total of 1900 subjects were ongoing at the time of the interim data cut; and 526 subjects 
completed Study 322OPI-004. A total of 1015 subjects discontinued from the studies, including 413 
subjects who were rescued. In Study 305, more subjects receiving MET+glipizide required 
hyperglycaemic rescue compared with those receiving MET+A12.5 or MET+A25. More subjects in the 
MET+A25+P30 group completed Study 322OPI-004, primarily due to more subjects requiring 
hyperglycaemic rescue on MET+P45. The primary causes of discontinuation excluding hyperglycaemic 
rescue were AEs, major protocol deviations and voluntary withdrawals. No meaningful differences across 
treatment groups were observed for any demographic or baseline characteristic with respect to sex, age, 
race, and BMI (Table 5). Mean age across the studies ranged from 54 to 56 years. In these 2 studies, 615 
subjects (18%) were elderly (65 years), with 57 subjects (2%) at least 75 years. The majority of all 
randomized subjects were White (59.9 to 64.2%). Mean BMI for all randomized subjects ranged from 31 
to 32. Mean duration of T2DM was 5.51 years in Study 305 and 7.16 years in Study 322OPI-004.

***p<0.001 vs placebo. 
In Study 010, which included subjects who were experiencing inadequate glycaemic control with diet and 
exercise alone, both doses of alogliptin (12.5 and 25 mg) resulted in reductions in HbA1c compared with 
placebo therapy. This effect was observed as early as Week 4 and continued throughout the 26-week 
treatment period. Although monotherapy treatment with alogliptin is not a proposed indication, this study 
supports the glucose-lowering effect of alogliptin in a population untreated with other antidiabetic 
medications.  
Subjects received alogliptin or placebo as add-on therapy to SU (glyburide ≥10 mg or MTD) in Study 007. 
Compared with placebo, subjects in both the alogliptin 12.5 and 25 mg groups achieved statistically 
significant, placebo-corrected LS mean reductions in HbA1c at Week 26. This effect was observed as early 
as Week 4 and continued throughout the 26-week treatment period, with the greatest reductions 
consistently observed in the alogliptin 25 mg group (Figure 2).

All treated subjects in Study 008 received MET at baseline (mean dose of 1846.7 mg). Compared with 
placebo, subjects in both the alogliptin 12.5 and 25 mg groups achieved statistically significant, 
placebo-corrected LS mean reductions in HbA1c at Week 26. As in Study 007, this effect was observed as 
early as Week 4 and continued throughout the 26-week treatment period. There was no differentiation in 
terms of HbA1c reduction between both alogliptin doses (Figure 3).

In Study 009, subjects received alogliptin or placebo as add-on therapy to TZD with or without MET or SU. 
Statistically significant LS mean differences from placebo were seen for both the alogliptin 12.5 mg and 
25 mg groups (Figure 4). Reductions (compared with placebo) were seen regardless of pioglitazone dose 
or whether the subject was receiving pioglitazone with or without SU or MET. Of the 493 subjects 
randomized in the study, 112 (23%) received alogliptin (89 subjects) or placebo (23 subjects) as add-on 
therapy to pioglitazone alone. Although the number of subjects receiving add-on therapy to TZD alone is 
somewhat limited in this study, the overall response is clinically relevant. In the supportive initial 
combination Study 322OPI-002, the combination of alogliptin 25 mg+pioglitazone 30 mg showed a 
decrease in HbA1c of 1.71%. In Study 009, 277 subjects (56%) received alogliptin (221 subjects) or 
placebo (56 subjects) as add-on therapy to TZD plus MET. The positive clinical response of add-on 
therapy to TZD and MET is confirmed in Study 322OPI-004, as described below.

Figure 4 Study 009 (add-on to TZD): Change from baseline in LS Mean of HbA1c (%) 
by Visit—Full Analysis Set 
In Study 011, 390 subjects received alogliptin or placebo as add-on therapy to insulin with MET 
(228 subjects, 58%) or without MET (162 subjects, 42%). Over a 4-week Run-in Period, subjects were 
optimized (or stabilized) on insulin, but mean baseline Hb1Ac was higher in this study (9.27%-9.29% 
across treatment groups) compared with the other 4 studies. Mean baseline MET dose for subjects who 
received insulin with MET (58%) in this study was 1732.7 mg, a maximized dose. Mean insulin dose, 
which may have been adjusted for events of hypoglycaemia, was consistent throughout the study 
(approximately 56.5 and 56.7 IU at baseline and at Week 26, respectively). The observed reduction in 
HbA1c seen in the study overall was clinically and statistically significant (0.71% alogliptin 25 mg vs 
0.13% placebo) (Figure 5). Because there was a higher baseline HbA1c in this study, a preplanned 
analysis with subcategories of baseline HbA1c (8.5%, 8.5%, and 9.0%, according to the broader 
inclusion criterion) confirmed that, irrespective of baseline HbA1c, subjects in the groups receiving 
alogliptin had clinically and statistically significant decreases from baseline in HbA1c levels at Week 26 
(-0.62%, -0.72%, and -0.82% for alogliptin 25 mg, respectively) compared with subjects receiving 
placebo (0.06%, -0.22%, and -0.30%, respectively; p<0.002). In the subgroups of subjects taking 
insulin with or without MET, change from baseline HbA1c was clinically relevant (-0.77% and -0.66%, 
respectively, alogliptin 25 mg).

Figure 5 Study 011 (add-on to insulin): Change from baseline in LS Mean of HbA1c 
(%) by Visit—Full Analysis Set 
Reductions in HbA1c were seen regardless of sex, age, race, or baseline BMI. Subjects in the alogliptin 25 
mg group achieved greater LS mean reductions in HbA1c than subjects in the alogliptin 12.5 mg group in 
4 of the 5 studies. The difference in effect with alogliptin 25 mg group compared with the alogliptin 12.5 
mg group is more apparent in subjects with higher baseline HbA1c levels. 
Main Phase III, Long-Term, Active-Comparator Studies 
In both long-term, active-controlled studies (305 and 322OPI-004), greater LS mean reductions from 
baseline in HbA1c were observed in the alogliptin groups than in the comparator groups at Weeks 26 and 
52, and alogliptin efficacy was shown to be sustained for up to 52 weeks. In Study 305, statistical 
non-inferiority of MET+alogliptin 25 mg and MET+alogliptin 12.5 mg was demonstrated vs MET+glipizide 
(Figure 6). Mean final glipizide dose of 5.2 mg in the MET+glipizide group was lower than expected. The 
low mean glipizide dose may be a reflection of the relatively low baseline HbA1c (mean, 7.60%) and FPG 
(mean, 8.19 mmol/L). This resulted in a low incidence of hyperglycaemic rescue in all treatment groups 
(9.1% MET+alogliptin 25 mg vs 12.0% MET+glipizide) requiring conservative dose titration. Due to the 
low baseline HbA1c and the low glipizide dose in the comparator group, a formal claim of non-inferiority 
would not be acceptable. However, despite the low mean glipizide dose, the incidence of hypoglycaemic 
events was greater in the MET+glipizide group (23.8%) compared with the MET+alogliptin 12.5 mg and 
MET+alogliptin 25 mg groups (2.5% and 1.4%, respectively).

Efficacy Results 
Secondary outcome parameters: 
Secondary endpoints include changes in other measures of glycaemic control, including clinical response, 
FPG, the incidence of marked hyperglycaemias, and the incidence of hyperglycaemic rescue. In addition, 
changes in pancreatic function variables, body weight and lipid parameters were examined. 
Clinical Response  
Clinical response was evaluated by assessing the percentage of subjects who achieved HbA1c levels of 
7.0% at Week 26, following treatment in the respective study. In all 5 Phase III placebo-controlled 
studies, a higher percentage of subjects in both alogliptin groups achieved these clinical response 
endpoints at Week 26 than in the placebo group (Table 6). Except in isolated incidences, differences from 
the placebo group were statistically significant across studies. With the exception of Study 011, which had 
a higher baseline HbA1c, similar percentages of subjects in the alogliptin 12.5 and 25 mg groups achieved 
HbA1c levels of 7.0% at Week 26.

Overall, higher percentages of subjects in the alogliptin groups achieved the 7.0% clinical response 
endpoint at Week 52 than in the comparator groups in both Studies 305 and 322OPI-004. In Study 305, 
significantly higher percentages of subjects in the MET+alogliptin 25 mg group (55.3%) achieved the 
HbA1c clinical response endpoint at Week 52 compared with the MET+glipizide group (47.4%; p<0.001).  
In Study 322OPI-004, significantly higher percentages of subjects in the MET+A25+P30 group (33.2%) 
achieved the HbA1c clinical response endpoint at Week 52 compared with the MET+P45 group (21.3%; 
p<0.001).  
Change from baseline in FPG  
Across the 5 main placebo-controlled studies, LS mean decreases in FPG observed in alogliptin-treated 
subjects were statistically significant compared with the placebo group for the alogliptin 25 mg group in 
all studies except Study 007 (add-on to SU) and for the alogliptin 12.5 mg group for all studies except 
Studies 007 and Study 011 (add-on to insulin) (Table 7). Additionally, in 4 of the 5 studies, subjects in the 
alogliptin 25 mg group achieved greater LS mean reductions in FPG than subjects in the alogliptin 
12.5 mg group.

Note: Results from ANCOVA models with effects for treatment, geographic region, and baseline FPG. Additional factors 
and covariates are included as specified in the individual study tables. 
In both long-term, active-comparator studies (305 and 322OPI-004), greater LS mean reductions from 
baseline in FPG were observed in the alogliptin groups than in the comparator groups at Weeks 26 and 52.  
In Study 305, the LS mean changes from baseline in FPG at Week 52 were -0.40, -0.28, and 0.05 mmol/L 
for the MET+alogliptin 25 mg, MET+alogliptin 12.5 mg, and MET+glipizide groups, respectively 
(p<0.001). In general, greater reductions were observed in the MET+alogliptin 25 mg group than in the 
MET+alogliptin 12.5 mg group. Additionally, LS mean decreases from baseline in FPG were apparent from 
the first assessment (Week 2) and continued throughout the majority of time points during the study. 
In Study 322OPI-004, the LS mean changes from baseline at Week 52 were -0.81 and -0.21 mmol/L in 
the MET+A25+P30 and MET+P45 groups, respectively (p<0.001). Additionally, LS mean decreases from 
baseline in FPG were statistically significant for the MET+A25+P30 group at all time points through Week 
52 compared with the MET+P45 group (p<0.01).

Body weight and serum lipids 
In the 5 main Phase III placebo-controlled studies, differential effects of alogliptin on weightwere 
observed. In Study 007 (combinations with SU), a statistically significant LS mean increase in weight was 
noted in both alogliptin groups compared with placebo (-0.20, 0.60, and 0.68 kg for the placebo, 12.5 mg 
alogliptin, and 25 mg alogliptin groups, respectively). In Study 305, statistically significant (p<0.001) LS 
mean decreases in body weight were observed at Week 52 in the MET+alogliptin 12.5 mg and 
MET+alogliptin 25 mg groups (-0.64 and -0.91 kg, respectively) compared with an increase in weight in 
the MET+glipizide group (0.89 kg). However, in Study 322OPI-004, mean changes in body weight were 
consistent with the concomitant medication (ie, pioglitazone) administered. At Week 52, LS mean 
increases in body weight were observed in both treatment groups (1.10 kg and 1.60 kg in the 
MET+A25+P30 and MET+P45 groups, respectively). These increases were not considered clinically 
meaningful and there was no statistically significant difference between treatment groups.  
Overall, changes from baseline in lipid parameters were similar in the alogliptin and placebo groups 
suggesting that treatment with alogliptin has a neutral effect on lipid parameters, regardless of 
administration as a monotherapy or as an add-on to established concomitant antidiabetic medications.

Results and Analysis 
Analysis description 
Primary Endpoint Analysis: An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model using last 
observation carried forward (LOCF) values was performed, with study treatment and 
geographic region as class variables and duration of T2DM and baseline HbA1c as 
continuous covariates. The A25 dose was compared with placebo at the 2-sided 
0.05 significance level using a contrast derived from the primary model. If this test result 
was statistically significant, the A12.5 dose was evaluated in a similar fashion.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) and in special 
populations 
To evaluate for HbA1c reduction consistency across multiple subpopulations, efficacy was assessed for 
subgroups of subjects defined by various baseline demographic factors. In consideration of limited 
sample sizes of some of these subgroups in individual studies, pooled analyses were conducted to 
supplement those completed in the individual studies for sex, age, race, BMI, baseline HbA1c, and renal 
function categories.  
For the pooled analyses, data were integrated from 4 of the main studies (010, 007, 008, and 009). Study 
011 was excluded from the pooled analysis because of differences in the study design (different 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 66/96 
 
  
  
randomization ratio) and in the study population (mean baseline HbA1c, mean disease duration). A total 
of 1845 subjects are included in these post hoc pooled analyses.  
Results indicate that the placebo-adjusted treatment difference in HbA1c is independent of sex and BMI. 
No clinically meaningful differences were observed between race categories. A tendency for greater 
efficacy in elderly subjects is observed.  
Elderly  
A total of 1990 subjects ≥65 years (21%) were treated in the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group. Of 
these, 224 subjects (2%) were ≥75 years and 2 subjects were ≥85 years. A total of 1285 subjects ≥65 
years (20%), 140 subjects ≥75 years (2%), and 1 subject ≥85 years were treated with alogliptin 
specifically.  
In the pooled analysis clinically relevant placebo-adjusted HbA1c mean changes from baseline were 
observed for both alogliptin doses (-0.44% and -0.59% for 12.5 mg; -0.51% and -0.67% for 25 mg) in 
both age categories (<65 and ≥65 years, respectively), with no clinically meaningful differences observed. 
There was a relatively small number of patients aged ≥75 years. Nevertheless, in these patients, 
placebo-adjusted HbA1c changes were -0.418 % for alogliptin 12.5 mg (n=26) and -0.484% for alogliptin 
25 mg (n=20). Overall, these results are supportive of the findings of the primary analyses from each of 
the individual main Phase III studies.  
In the long-term Studies 305 and 322OPI-004, clinically relevant HbA1c reductions were observed at 
Week 52 for elderly subjects (≥65 years) who received alogliptin 25 mg, in keeping with the results of the 
pooled analysis (-0.58% in Study 305 [n=173] and -0.97% in Study 322OPI-004 [n=50]). These 
reductions were greater than in the younger population (<65 years) (-0.44% in Study 305 [n=693] and 
-0.68% in Study 322OPI-004 [n=253]).  
In Study 303, which specifically investigated the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of alogliptin (25 mg) vs 
glipizide (5-10 mg) in elderly subjects (65 to 90 years, inclusive, with a mean age of 69.9 years) over 
52 weeks, non-inferiority of the alogliptin group to the glipizide group was established. Furthermore, 
application of the more stringent non-inferiority margin of 0.3% confirmed non-inferiority of alogliptin 
25 mg to glipizide. 
HbA1c reductions in Study 303 were lower than expected by Week 52 (-0.14% for alogliptin and -0.09% 
for glipizide). Although the initial reductions in HbA1c and FPG observed were consistent with what was 
expected of these medications, the fact that these reductions returned to near-baseline values by study 
end in both treatment groups was unanticipated. Study 303 enrolled both treatment naïve subjects 
(55.4%), who had failed HbA1c control on diet and exercise alone, and subjects with inadequate HbA1c 
control despite oral antidiabetic monotherapy (45.6%). For the latter group of subjects, their oral 
antidiabetic monotherapy (eg, MET) was discontinued for a 4-week washout period prior to study entry. 
The HbA1c change from baseline to Week 52 in subjects who had previously been treated with 
monotherapy was-0.08% (alogliptin) and  -0.04% (glipizide), which was smaller than the HbA1c 
reductions observed in treatment naïve subjects:  -0.32% (alogliptin) and  -0.17% (glipizide).The fact 
that these results were observed in both treatment groups indicates that the observed efficacy response 
was largely related to the specific study design, for example, the inclusion of subjects on monotherapy 
(with a short period of background therapy washout). Although results from this study showed similar 
glycaemic control efficacy between alogliptin and glipizide, a substantial difference between the 2 
treatments was observed with regard to hypoglycaemia. These results are discussed in greater detail in 
the safety section. Treatment with alogliptin vs glipizide also conferred benefits with regard to weight 
maintenance and triglyceride levels.

Subjects with Impaired Renal Function 
Pharmacokinetic data generated in subjects with T2DM demonstrated increased systemic exposure with 
decreasing renal function (see pharmacokinetic section). A dose reduction is therefore recommended for 
patients with moderate to severe renal impairment or ESRD so that exposure to alogliptin in these 
patients is similar to that of patients with normal renal function. These results confirm the 
pharmacokinetic profile observed in phase 1 study subjects with mild or moderate renal impairment.  
Clinical data are presented according to the definition of the modification of diet in renal disease (MDRD) 
formula. 
In Phase III studies, most subjects had either normal renal function or mild renal impairment. Of those 
subjects who had renal impairment, in the majority of subjects it was mild and a small proportion had 
moderate impairment. This was, in part, due to the concomitant use of MET, which is contraindicated in 
patients with renal impairment. For the 4 main Phase III placebo-controlled studies (010, 007, 008, and 
009), data were integrated to conduct a pooled analysis for the subgroup of subjects stratified by renal 
function, according to the MDRD formula.  
In the pooled analysis, based on the recommended doses of alogliptin in accordance with baseline renal 
function, alogliptin 25 mg produced clinically relevant HbA1c reduction at Week 26 in subjects with 
normal renal function (120 subjects) and mild renal impairment (493 subjects) (LS mean difference of 
–0.69% and –0.49%) and alogliptin 12.5 mg produced clinically relevant HbA1c reduction in subjects with 
moderate renal impairment (97 subjects) (LS mean difference of –0.70%). These findings support the 
results of the pharmacokinetic study (006) in subjects with renal impairment. 
Study 402, an ongoing, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-arm study, designed to evaluate the CV 
safety of alogliptin compared with placebo in addition to standard of care specifically enrolled subjects 
with T2DM, a recent ACS event, and varying degrees of renal function (from normal to severely impaired). 
Results to date from this study indicated that the efficacy of the adjusted dose of alogliptin for subjects 
with moderate renal impairment is similar to that observed in subjects with normal renal function or mild 
renal impairment. In an interim analysis, 77 patients with severe renal insufficiency were treated for 6 
months (44 with alogliptin and 43 with placebo). After these 6 months of treatment, the mean change 
from baseline in HbA1c was -0.70% in the alogliptin group compared with -0.04% in the placebo group, 
with a between-group treatment difference of -0.66%.  
Longer term studies 
The persistence of efficacy of combination treatment including alogliptin has been demonstrated for up to 
52 weeks in Studies 305 and 322OPI-004, showing the durability of the glucose-lowering effect as 
assessed by HbA1c reduction (see above).  
In Study 305, at each of the post-baseline study visits, decreases in HbA1c were generally similar among 
the treatment groups, and MET+alogliptin 25 mg was found to be non-inferior to MET+glipizide.  
In Study 322OPI-004, significantly greater decreases in HbA1c were observed in the MET+A25+P30 
treatment group vs the MET+P45 treatment group (p<0.001 at all time points). At Week 52, the LS mean 
difference between treatment groups indicated non-inferiority of MET+A25+P30 to MET+P45. 
Furthermore, results at Week 52 also indicated statistical superiority of the MET+A25+P30 group to the 
MET+P45 group. 
This persistence of efficacy was not as apparent in Study 303 in elderly subjects, as described above. 
In the open-label safety extension study (012), with a treatment duration of up to 4 years, a mean 
decrease from baseline to Endpoint in HbA1c of -0.42% was observed for the subgroup of subjects on 
alogliptin 25 mg who had been rescued from a feed-in study. Meanwhile, for subjects on alogliptin 12.5 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 68/96 
 
  
  
and 25 mg who previously completed their feed-in study, mean increases from baseline to Endpoint of 
0.63% and 0.61%, respectively, were observed.  
Dose Response 
In pharmacodynamic studies, the alogliptin 25 mg dose achieved optimal DPP-4 inhibition and increases 
in active GLP-1 compared with the 12.5 mg dose. For doses greater than 25 mg, no additional benefit in 
DPP-4 inhibition or GLP-1 levels was observed, indicating that the 25 mg dose is the optimal dose to 
achieve therapeutic effect. In the phase 2 dose-ranging study (003), LS mean differences from placebo at 
Day 85 were statistically significant for alogliptin doses ≥12.5 mg for HbA1c and ≥25 mg for FPG, with no 
additional HbA1c reduction seen at doses greater than 25 mg.  
Across the 5 main Phase III, 26-week placebo-controlled studies, alogliptin 25 mg generally provided 
more substantial HbA1c reductions compared with alogliptin 12.5 mg. The differences in efficacy were 
consistently more apparent in the 3 studies with the relatively higher baseline HbA1c (ie, Studies 007, 
009, and 011).  
In the 2 main studies evaluating alogliptin add-on to MET (008 and 305), differentiation in terms of HbA1c 
reduction between both alogliptin doses was less apparent, likely related to the lower mean baseline 
HbA1c (7.9% and 7.6%, respectively). In contrast, a good dose response for alogliptin add-on to MET was 
evident in 2 relevant treatment arms in supportive Study 322OPI-001, in which alogliptin 25 mg showed 
greater reductions in HbA1c compared with alogliptin 12.5 mg (-0.90% vs -0.64%), in a setting with a 
higher mean baseline HbA1c (8.5%).  
Across the clinical program, alogliptin 25 mg generally showed a greater response in secondary endpoints 
(analysis of HbA1c by baseline HbA1c values, clinical response, change from baseline in FPG, and 
hyperglycaemia) compared with alogliptin 12.5 mg.  
These results of individual studies were substantiated using a pooled analysis of 4 of the main Phase III 
studies (010, 007, 008, and 009) with greater efficacy observed in the alogliptin 25 mg group. 
Supportive studies 
The efficacy of alogliptin is further supported by 3 Phase III studies.  
Study 302 was conducted with a focus on confirming that the efficacy and safety of once-daily and BID 
dosing of alogliptin were comparable. Phase 1 Study 322-101 had shown that DPP-4 inhibition was similar 
(>80%) for both dosing schedules. In Study 302, subjects received alogliptin 25 mg once daily, alogliptin 
12.5 mg BID, MET 500 mg BID, MET 1000 mg BID, alogliptin 12.5 mg+MET 500 mg BID, alogliptin 
12.5 mg +MET 1000 mg BID, or placebo over a 26-week period. A total of 784 subjects were randomized 
to receive treatment.  
At Week 26, LS mean changes from baseline in HbA1c were significantly greater (p<0.001) with both 
coadministration therapy regimens (-1.22% and -1.55% with alogliptin 12.5 mg+MET 500 mg BID and 
alogliptin 12.5 mg+MET 1000 mg BID, respectively) when compared with either of their individual 
component regimens, alogliptin alone (-0.56% with alogliptin 12.5 mg BID) or MET alone (-0.65% 
and -1.11% with MET 500 mg and MET 1000 mg BID, respectively). In addition, both alogliptin dosing 
regimens (25 mg once daily vs 12.5 mg BID) resulted in similar HbA1c reduction (-0.52% and 0.56%, 
respectively), thereby supporting that alogliptin can be administered in a BID FDC tablet with MET.  
Study 322OPI-001 evaluated 12 treatment groups (in addition to background MET) over a 26-week 
period: placebo+placebo, or pioglitazone 15 mg, 30 mg, or 45 mg once daily; alogliptin 
12.5 mg+placebo or pioglitazone 15 mg, 30 mg, or 45 mg once daily; alogliptin 25 mg+placebo or 
pioglitazone 15 mg, 30 mg, or 45 mg once daily. A total of 1554 subjects were randomized to receive 
treatment.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 69/96 
 
  
  
In subjects who were experiencing inadequate glycaemic control with MET alone (mean baseline HbA1c 
values of approximately 8.5%), there were statistically significant (p0.001) decreases from baseline in 
the LS mean HbA1c levels at Week 26 in subjects treated in the alogliptin 12.5 mg+pioglitazone and 
alogliptin 25 mg+pioglitazone groups compared with pioglitazone alone (LS mean changes from baseline 
in HbA1c were -0.89%, -1.43%, and -1.42% in the pioglitazone alone, alogliptin 12.5 mg+pioglitazone, 
and alogliptin 25 mg+pioglitazone groups, respectively). 
A dose response for alogliptin add-on to MET was evident, in which alogliptin 25 mg showed a greater 
reduction in HbA1c compared with alogliptin 12.5 mg (-0.90% vs -0.64%), in a setting with a higher 
mean baseline HbA1c. 
Study 322OPI-002 was a 26-week initial combination (alogliptin+pioglitazone) study. Subjects were 
randomized to receive alogliptin 12.5 mg+pioglitazone 30 mg once daily, alogliptin 25 mg+pioglitazone 
30 mg once daily, alogliptin 25 mg+placebo once daily, or pioglitazone 30 mg+placebo once daily. A total 
of 655 subjects were randomized to receive treatment.  
Both of the alogliptin 12.5 mg+pioglitazone 30 mg and alogliptin 25 mg+pioglitazone 30 mg groups 
demonstrated better efficacy with respect to HbA1c reductions vs pioglitazone 30 mg alone. 
Overall, the data collected in these supporting studies reflect the conclusions made from the results seen 
in the main placebo- and active-controlled studies. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
An extensive number of randomized trials has been performed, including trials with placebo and active 
comparators, and in combination with several other antidiabetic agents.  
Dose selection 
In the initial dose finding studies, no additional efficacy was observed at doses greater than 12.5 mg. 
However, the inclusion of alogliptin 12.5 mg and 25 mg in the Phase III trials was reasonable. In most 
pivotal studies, the difference between alogliptin 12.5 mg and 25 mg was not large, but the efficacy for 
alogliptin 25 mg was somewhat more pronounced. Therefore, the choice for alogliptin 25 mg was 
acceptable.  
Pivotal trials 
In each of the studies, no meaningful differences across treatment groups were observed for any 
demographic or baseline characteristic. Change from baseline in HbA1c was the primary endpoint. 
For the combination with metformin, two pivotal studies are submitted (studies 008 and 305). The 
first study is a 26-week, placebo-controlled study, while the second is a 2-year active controlled study, 
with interim 52 week data presented, in which glipizide was used as the active comparator. In 
combination with metformin, the treatment effect of alogliptin 25 mg was -0.48% (95% CI -0.67 
to -0.30) in comparison to placebo after 26 weeks. According to the diabetes guideline 
(CPMP/EWP/1080/00) non-inferiority of the new agent to an established active comparator as add-on to 
monotherapy (representing standard of care) should be demonstrated. In this case, standard of care 
would be metformin + SU. In the non-inferiority trial 305, both alogliptin 25 mg and glipizide were 
associated with a clinically relevant reduction in HbA1c. However, baseline HbA1c was relatively low in 
these patients (7.6%). This decreases the power to detect any differences between treatments. In 
addition, the glipizide dose in the comparator group was relatively low (mean dose 5.2 mg). This is 
probably due to the dose titration algorithm. Following any dose-titration, a subject who experienced 
hypoglycaemia was allowed to reduce the dose to as low as 5 mg glipizide (or matching placebo) and 
continue the study on that dose. Following down titration, subjects were not allowed to increase the dose

again. With such a low dose of glipizide, the CHMP concluded that  non-inferiority of alogliptin when 
compared to SU as add-on therapy to metformin has not been established.  
For the combination with SU, pivotal study 007 is submitted. In this study, alogliptin is compared to 
placebo in patients treated with SU. For the combination with SU, the treatment effect of alogliptin 25 mg 
was -0.53% (95% CI -0.73 to -0.33) after 26 weeks in comparison to placebo.  
For the combination with TZD (with or without metformin), pivotal study 009 is submitted. In this 
study, alogliptin is compared to placebo in patients treated with TZD (with or without metformin). In 
addition, supportive Study 322OPI-004 is submitted. This is a 52 week active controlled study designed 
to evaluate the efficacy of alogliptin as triple therapy (add-on to pioglitazone 30 mg and MET), in which 
efficacy was compared with uptitration of pioglitazone, in subjects on pioglitazone 30 mg and MET. The 
combination with TZD and SU is not requested. Nevertheless, a small number of patients treated with 
alogliptin in combination with TZD and SU was investigated in pivotal study 009. For the combination with 
TZD (with or without metformin), alogliptin 25 mg was associated with a reduction in Hba1c of -0.61% 
(95% CI -0.80 to -0.41) after 26 weeks in comparison to placebo. Treatment effects were clinically 
relevant for alogliptin 25 mg in combination with TZD only (-0.49%) and in combination with TZD and 
metformin (-0.72%). In addition, in study 322OPI-004, the effects of adding alogliptin 25 mg were 
non-inferior compared with increasing the dose of pioglitazone from 30 to 45 mg. 
For the combination with insulin, study 011 was submitted. The objective of this study was to evaluate 
the efficacy of alogliptin administered in combination with insulin as compared with insulin alone. For the 
combination with insulin, treatment effect of alogliptin 25 mg was modest, but clinically relevant 
(-0.59%; 95% CI -0.80 to -0.37) after 26 weeks. There were no meaningful differences in the treatment 
groups in daily insulin dose before and after treatment with alogliptin. There were no important 
differences in the treatment effects of alogliptin 25 mg between patients with and without metformin. In 
this study, however, baseline HbA1c values were relatively high (9.3%). This may have resulted in an 
overestimation of the treatment effects of alogliptin on HbA1c. Nevertheless, in the individuals with 
HbA1c below 8.5%, the effect of alogliptin 25mg on HbA1c was also clinically relevant (-0.68%). 
Combinations of alogliptin and insulin with other oral antidiabetic drugs were not investigated.  
A monotherapy indication is not requested. However, a monotherapy study (010) comparing alogliptin 
with placebo is submitted. Compared to placebo, alogliptin 25 mg was associated with a reduction in 
HbA1c of -0.57% (-0.80 to -0.35). 
Renal impairment 
Renal dose adjustment recommendations of alogliptin 12.5 mg and alogliptin 6.25 mg, respectively, for 
patients with moderate and severe renal impairment/ESRD are based on PK data. In the pivotal trials, 
efficacy was not importantly influenced by mild or moderate renal impairment, but patients with severe 
renal impairment were not included in these pivotal trials. During the procedure, the CHMP therefore 
requested more data to support the use of the suggested dose adjustments in renal impairment. The 
applicant provided data from a supportive ongoing trial (study 402) with patients with a recent acute 
coronary syndrome; a satisfactory treatment effect was shown for alogliptin 6.25 mg in patients with 
severe renal insufficiency after 6 months of treatment with a mean change from baseline in HbA1c of 
-0.70% in the alogliptin group (n=44) compared with -0.04% in the placebo group (n=43), with a 
between-group treatment difference of -0.66%.  
Elderly individuals 
Diabetes is a disease that is especially prevalent in elderly individuals. In the pivotal trials, the treatment 
effect of alogliptin was not lower in patients >65 years compared to patients <65 years. However, only 
2% of the patients treated with alogliptin were >75 years of age (n=124). Therefore, a study in elderly 
individuals was performed (study 303). Alogliptin 25 mg was statistically non-inferior to glipizide. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 71/96 
 
  
  
However, baseline mean HbA1c values were relatively low (approximately 7.5%). This decreases the 
power to detect any differences between treatments. The overall results from supportive Study 303 
showed minimal glycaemic improvements in both the alogliptin and glipizide treatment arms after 
52 weeks of treatment in an elderly T2DM population. The fact that these results were observed in both 
treatment groups indicates that the observed efficacy response was largely related to the specific study 
design, for example, the low baseline HbA1c and the inclusion of subjects on monotherapy (with a short 
period of background therapy washout). Importantly, results of the large pooled analysis of 2234 subjects 
from the 5 main Phase III, 26-week, placebo-controlled studies, demonstrate relevant efficacy in the 
elderly. In patients aged ≥75 years alogliptin was associated with a treatment effect of -0.49% (95% 
CI-1.03, 0.06). Furthermore, efficacy results from the 2 main Phase III, active-controlled studies (total of 
237 elderly subjects) demonstrated that HbA1c reductions at Week 52 were greater in subjects 
≥65 years compared with subjects <65 years. In these two studies data interpretation in subjects 
≥75 years who received alogliptin 25 mg is limited by the small numbers of subjects. The HbA1c 
reductions at Week 52 for these subjects were -0.29% in Study 305 (n=17) and -1.45% in 
Study 322OPI-004 (n=4).   
These results, taken together, suggest that alogliptin is a useful treatment option for elderly patients. 
Long term effects 
Although the extension trial was primarily a safety trial (study 012), after 4 years the increase in HbA1c 
with alogliptin 25 mg was clinically relevant (+0.61%). In addition, in the study 303 in elderly individuals, 
efficacy after 1 year became negligible. However, in the two main non-inferiority trials (study 004 and 
305) after 1 year, treatment effects of alogliptin were relatively stable compared to glipizide (study 004) 
and compared to increasing the dose of pioglitazone (study 305).  
Statistical considerations 
Analysis of change from baseline in HbA1c (primary endpoint) was based on FAS (placebo-controlled 
studies) or PPS (active-comparator studies) with the LOCF. This is accepted. However, more subjects in 
the placebo group than in the treatment group discontinued the study, particularly due to hyperglycaemic 
rescue. This was according to protocol, and was thus not considered a major protocol deviation (i.e. these 
patients would still be included in the PPS). This could lead to an overestimation of the treatment effect. 
As expected, subjects in the placebo group who completed the studies had a larger reduction in HbA1c 
compared to placebo subjects in the FAS. Therefore, the differences between alogliptin and placebo were 
less pronounced in the completer population. However, the differences were still statistically significant. 
Secondary endpoints 
The results of the analysis of the effects of alogliptin on fasting plasma glucose and the need for rescue 
therapy were in line with the effects on HbA1c. Alogliptin was not associated with weight gain in most 
studies. However, in combination with SU, alogliptin was associated with an LS mean difference from 
placebo in weight of +0.8 and +0.9 kg for the Alogliptin 12.5 mg and Alogliptin 25 mg dose levels. 
However, the differences were small and are not likely to be clinically meaningful. There were no 
important effects on serum lipids. There tended to be effects on estimates of endocrine pancreatic 
function. However, these effects were not statistically significant in the majority of the studies. In addition, 
these serum measures (such as fasting proinsulin, fasting insulin, proinsulin/insulin ratio, C peptide and 
HOMA) are only surrogate estimates of pancreatic function. Compared with placebo, alogliptin 25 mg was 
associated with statistically significant reductions from baseline inHbA1c and postprandial total 
triglycerides levels. 
Effect of race 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 72/96 
 
  
  
The majority of the patients were White. In the pooled data, the clinical relevance of the treatment effect 
of alogliptin in Whites is of borderline significance (-0.44% and -0.50%) but still clinically relevant.  In 
addition, subgroup analyses in the individual main studies demonstrate that the effect is of borderline 
relevance for some of the requested indications. Specifically, for alogliptin add-on to SU (study 007), the 
treatment effect of alogliptin 25 mg is -0.38%. For alogliptin add-on to metformin (study 008), the 
treatment effect of alogliptin 25 mg is -0.36%. However, in these studies the differences between the 
races were small. In addition, the differences between the races were even less pronounced in the other 
studies. 
Initial combination studies 
In an initial combination study, both coadministration therapy regimens of alogliptin plus metformin 
(Alogliptin 12.5 mg + Met 500 mg BID and Alogliptin 12.5 mg + Met 1000 mg BID) resulted in larger 
reductions in HbA1c compared to their individual component regimens of alogliptin alone or metformin 
alone. Alogliptin 12.5 mg BID provided similar glycaemic control compared with alogliptin 25 mg once 
daily. In patients inadequately controlled with metformin, each individual combination of 
Alogliptin+Pioglitazone achieved larger reductions in HbA1c at Week 26 compared with the corresponding 
alogliptin and pioglitazone doses given alone. These differences were clinically relevant. The initial 
combination of alogliptin and pioglitazone was associated with a reduction in HbA1c that was larger than 
that with alogliptin and pioglitazone monotherapy. These data provide further support for the use of 
alogliptin in combination with metformin and/or pioglitazone, but initial combination therapy is not an 
indication requested by the applicant. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, efficacy was found to be modest with an effect size with regard to lowering of HbA1C of about 
0.5% - 0.6% as add-on therapy, but still being statistically significant and clinically relevant.  
Efficacy was further investigated specifically in subgroups, and found to be satisfactory, in caucasian 
patients, in elderly patients and in patients with renal impairment including sever insufficiency (with an 
adjusted dose of alogliptin).  
Due to the low dose of glipizide and the low baseline HbA1c (study 305), non-inferiority of alogliptin 
compared to glipizide as add-on therapy to metformin has not been established. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Data from all 55 clinical studies that comprise this MAA submission were used in the overall evaluation of 
safety. However, the focus of the safety assessment involves the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group 
and the main Phase III studies (Table 2). 
Safety data from the 12 completed phase 2 and 3 studies (003, 007, 008, 009, 010, 011, 301, 302, 303, 
322OPI-004, 322OPI-001, and 322OPI-002) and 1 ongoing Phase III study (305), at the time of 
evaluation of this application, were pooled into the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group. As the patient 
populations enrolled into these studies best represent the intended use of alogliptin, results from this 
Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group are the primary focus of the evaluation of clinical safety. These 
data were pooled to allow for an opportunity to detect rare events and potential safety signals. Studies are 
also assessed individually for specific indications, as appropriate. In addition, data from 4 of the main 
Phase III placebo-controlled studies (007, 008, 009, 010) were pooled to evaluate the safety data from a 
pool of main studies relevant to the proposed indications. 
Study 012 is an uncontrolled safety extension study and the CV outcome study (study 402, ongoing at the 
time of evaluation of this application) is evaluating a specific subpopulation of patients with T2DM and 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013

recent ACS; therefore, these studies are excluded from the pooled data but are discussed separately, as 
appropriate.  
Patient exposure 
The number of subjects exposed to study drug, the duration of exposure, categorized duration of 
exposure, and cumulative exposure (subject-years) for subjects who participated in the phase 2 and 3 
studies (the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group and Studies 012 and 402) are summarized in Table 15. 
The cutoff date of the database is not clearly specified.  In Study 402, all subjects are counted within the 
alogliptin 25 mg group, although different doses were assigned according to renal function, such that all 
subjects had equivalent exposure. Furthermore, higher numbers of subjects in the overall program were 
exposed to alogliptin 25 mg compared with 12.5 mg. Additionally, asymmetrical randomization schedules 
in the Phase III studies resulted in a proportionately smaller number of subjects in the placebo group 
compared with active comparator and the alogliptin groups. For these reasons, exposure-corrected rates 
for adverse events are included in key tables.

All subjects in the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group had a diagnosis of T2DM with inadequate 
glycaemic control. At the discretion of the investigator, subjects with a major illness or debility were 
excluded. Specific prohibited prior and concurrent conditions included New York Heart Association [NYHA] 
Class III or IV heart failure (Classes I-IV in Study 322OPI-004); angioedema associated with 
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin-II receptor blockers (except 301); treated 
diabetic gastroparesis, laser-treated proliferative diabetic retinopathy (except 301), haemoglobinopathy 
(due to potential effect on HbA1c determination); history within 6 months (3 months for Studies 302 and 
305) prior to Screening of coronary angioplasty, coronary stent placement, coronary bypass surgery, or 
MI; and history within 5 years prior to Screening of cancers other than squamous cell or basal cell 
carcinoma of the skin. 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics were comparable among the treatment groups. The 
majority (79%) of subjects were less than 65 years, with a mean age ranging from 54.9 to 56.3 years, 
although there was an adequate representation of elderly subjects in the program. A total of 1990 
subjects were at least 65 years, 224 were ≥75 years, and 2 subjects were ≥85 years. Most (69%) 
subjects were White. Slightly more than half (54%) of the subjects had a BMI greater than 30. At baseline, 
mean HbA1c ranged from 8.00% to 8.39% across treatment groups.  
Across the main safety pool, approximately 20% of subjects were from Europe, 33% were from the US or 
Canada, 23% were from Latin/South America, and 23% were from other regions, mainly Asia/Pacific 
countries.

 (a) Combines the 12.5 and 25 mg groups (already shown in the table) with the 6.25, 50, and 100 mg groups (which 
are not shown in the table). 
The incidence of TEAEs was comparable across treatment groups (68.6% active comparator vs 66.6% 
alogliptin), although slightly lower in subjects receiving placebo (64.8%). However, in terms of events per 
100 subject-years, the numbers were higher in the placebo group (438.0) than in the other groups (330.1 
active comparator vs 340.5 alogliptin). The incidence of SAEs was slightly higher in the active comparator 
group (5.2%) than in the alogliptin 25 mg group (4.7%), the alogliptin 12.5 mg group (4.0%) or the 
placebo group (3.2%). For TEAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug, more subjects were withdrawn 
in the active comparator group (5.8%) than in the alogliptin group (3.9%) or the placebo group (2.3%). 
The incidence of deaths within the study period was low, with no deaths reported in the placebo group, 4 
deaths in the active comparator group (0.2%), and 9 deaths (0.1%) in the alogliptin group.

are not shown in the table). 
(b) Ordered by descending frequency in the alogliptin 25 mg group. 
Percentages of subjects who experienced at least 1 TEAE were comparable among treatment groups. The 
most common TEAEs reported in ≥5% of subjects treated with alogliptin 25 mg and more frequently than 
in subjects who received placebo or active comparators were headache, nasopharyngitis, and upper 
respiratory tract infection.  
The majority of the TEAEs experienced were considered by the investigator as either mild or moderate in 
intensity. No specific TEAE of severe intensity occurred in >1.0% of subjects in any group.  
TEAEs reported in ≥1% of subjects treated with alogliptin 25 mg and occurring with a frequency twice 
the rate of placebo or active comparator (with at least 2 subjects if zero in the comparator group) were 
identified for consideration as possible adverse drug reactions. Compared with placebo, events meeting 
the criteria were upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharyngitis, influenza, headache, abdominal pain, 
diarrhoea, nausea, pruritus, rash, back pain, musculoskeletal pain, and myalgia. Compared with active 
comparator, events meeting the criteria were nasopharyngitis, insomnia, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, 
gastroesophageal reflux disease, nausea, muscle spasms, musculoskeletal pain, hypersensitivity, 
headache, and rash. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Fifteen deaths were reported in the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group (11/6354 in the alogliptin 
group [0.17%]; 4/2257 in the active comparator group [0.18%]; and none in the placebo group). Most 
deaths were CV in nature. Only 2 of the 15 deaths (both in the alogliptin group) were considered by the 
investigator to have a possible relationship to study drug. 
In the CV outcomes Study 402, deaths were reported for 26 subjects who received placebo (26/1079; 
2.4%), 17 subjects who received alogliptin (17/1070; 1.6%), and 1 subject whose treatment assignment 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 76/96 
 
  
  
 
 
is unknown at this time (occurred after the clinical database cut for the interim analysis). None of these 
deaths was considered to be related to administration of study drug. 
A total of 44 deaths occurred in the open-label safety extension Study 012 (44/3320; 1.3%). Ten of the 
deaths were considered to have a possible relationship to study drug by the investigator. 
An additional 5 deaths occurred in the Japanese studies (5/1649; 0.3%), all considered unrelated to study 
drug. 
Overall, a low and similar percentage of subjects across treatment groups experienced at least 1 SAE 
(placebo 3.2%; active comparator 5.2%; alogliptin 12.5 mg 4.0%, alogliptin 25 mg 4.7%; Table 16). 
SAEs were reported most frequently in the cardiac disorder SOC, followed by the infections and 
infestations SOC. The incidence of SAEs associated with cardiac disorders was comparable between the 
alogliptin 25 mg and active comparator groups (1.0% and 1.2%, respectively) and greater compared 
with placebo (0.4%).  
A slightly higher percentage of subjects discontinued due to a TEAE in the alogliptin 25 mg group (4.1%) 
than the alogliptin 12.5 mg (3.6%) group. There was no discernible pattern of discontinuations with 
respect to type of TEAE. Notably, the percentage of subjects in the alogliptin groups (3.9%) that 
discontinued due to a TEAE was lower than for subjects who received active comparator (5.8%). 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Special-interest TEAEs were predefined based on observations made during the clinical program, 
conditions in the T2DM patient population, and known or suspected effects of the drug class.  
CV Safety 
In the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group, the percentages of subjects who experienced a TEAE from 
the SOC of cardiac disorders were comparable between the alogliptin 25 mg and active comparator 
groups (4.5% and 4.9%, respectively) and greater compared with placebo (2.5%). The most frequently 
reported cardiac disorder TEAEs in the alogliptin 25 mg group were angina pectoris and palpitations. The 
incidence of SAEs associated with cardiac disorders was comparable between the alogliptin 25 mg and 
active comparator groups (1.0% and 1.2%, respectively) and greater compared with placebo (0.4%). 
The most frequently reported cardiac disorder SAE in subjects receiving alogliptin 25 mg was angina 
pectoris. The incidence of events of hypertension was slightly higher in the active comparator group 
(4.5%) than for subjects receiving alogliptin 12.5 mg (3.6%) and 25 mg (3.9%), but slightly lower in the 
placebo group (3.3%).  
In the adjudicated MACE analysis for the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group, the incidence of CV death 
and nonfatal MI was similar and low in the alogliptin (0.1% and 0.2%, respectively) and active 
comparator groups (0.1% and 0.3%, respectively), while no subject receiving placebo reported CV death 
or nonfatal MI. The incidence of nonfatal stroke was lower for alogliptin-treated (<0.1%) subjects than for 
active comparator-treated (0.2%) and placebo (0.3%) subjects. 
Using a Cox Proportional Hazards (CPH) model for adjudicated MACE for the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 
Study Group, a hazard ratio of alogliptin against all comparators (placebo and active) was 0.806. 
During the procedure, the CHMP did seek clarification on the cases of cardiac failure and myocardial 
infarction designated as nonserious. The applicant stated that there were 20 subjects in total in the 
alogliptin clinical studies who experienced adverse events (AEs) of cardiac failure/cardiac failure 
congestive (14 subjects) or myocardial infarction (6 subjects) in which the event had been classified by 
the investigator as nonserious. The applicant did provide details of the definition of SAEs provided to the 
investigators, which was applied consistently for all studies and also provided detailed case narratives for 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 77/96 
 
  
  
these 20 subjects; a clinical review of the available data was performed and a rationale for the nonserious 
designation has been determined based on that data. The review of the 6 subjects with nonserious AEs of 
myocardial infarction indicated that these were reported by investigators on the basis of ECG findings, 
suggestive of myocardial ischaemia rather than hospital admissions with typical chest pain (and 
confirmatory cardiac enzyme rise). The majority of these AEs were supported with sufficient clinical 
information indicating that the nonserious classification was appropriate. Similarly, reassuring 
descriptions were provided by the applicant for the cases of heart failure, and therefore the CHMP 
considered this concern as being resolved.  
The CV risk of alogliptin is also being assessed in the CV outcomes Study 402. In that study, potential CV 
events are being collected and independently and prospectively adjudicated (by a blinded cardiovascular 
endpoint committee [CEC]). The incidence of CV death (1.0%) and nonfatal stroke (0.5%) in the interim 
analysis were the same for alogliptin and placebo in this study, with the incidence of nonfatal MI higher in 
the placebo group (2.8%) than in the alogliptin group (2.0%). MACE results from the interim analysis of 
Study 402 were consistent (hazard ratio alogliptin vs placebo, 0.814) with the MACE analysis done for the 
Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Group. When urgent revascularization due to unstable angina is added to 
adjudicated events, the hazard ratio is lower at 0.750. The proportion of subjects requiring urgent 
revascularization was lower in the alogliptin group (0.4%) than in the placebo group (0.8%).  
Based on results showing no increase in MACE with alogliptin, no special warning/precaution regarding CV 
events is included but a warning concerning limited experience with alogliptin in patients with class III/IV 
congestive heart failure is included in section 4.4 of the SmPC.  
Hypersensitivity Reactions 
Hypersensitivity reactions are of special interest as they have been associated with the use of other DPP-4 
inhibitors. Administration of some DPP-4 inhibitors has been associated with dose- and 
duration-dependent necrotic peripheral skin lesions in monkeys. Such lesions have not been observed in 
alogliptin nonclinical studies nor have they in humans. 
Preferred terms were identified by severe cutaneous adverse reactions Standardized Medical Query (SMQ) 
(narrow-scope terms only), angioedema SMQ (narrow-scope terms only), and anaphylactic reaction SMQ 
(narrow-scope terms only). 
Overall, the frequency of hypersensitivity reactions was low (≤0.8%) and balanced across the treatment 
groups. There were no serious hypersensitivity reactions in subjects receiving alogliptin 12.5 mg or 25 mg. 
13 patients (0.2%) developed an anaphylactic reaction during alogliptin, whereas no patient developed 
an anaphylactic reaction during treatment with placebo. Although not part of the hypersensitivity reaction 
event search by SMQ, it is noted that a subject in the Phase III program (on alogliptin 25 mg) had an SAE 
of serum sickness that resulted in discontinuation of study drug.  
While safety results for alogliptin indicate a low incidence of hypersensitivity reactions, such reactions are 
included as an undesirable effect in section 4.8 of the SmPC, which is consistent with labeling for other 
DPP-4 inhibitors, and listed as a potential risk in the RMP. As additional pharmacovigilance activity the 
cardiovascular outcome study 402 is further investigating hypersensitivity reactions. The final study 
report is expected to be in the first quarter of 2014. 
Acute Pancreatitis 
No toxicological effects in the pancreas or pancreatic cells were observed in nonclinical studies of 
alogliptin. No evidence of pancreatitis was noted in the chronic toxicity studies in rats and dogs or in a 
2-year carcinogenicity studies in mice and rats.  
In the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group, the percentage of subjects reporting at least 1 acute 
pancreatitis TEAE was low in all groups, reported in 5 subjects (0.1%) treated with alogliptin 25 mg and 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 78/96 
 
  
  
2 subjects (<0.1%) with alogliptin 12.5 mg compared with 1 subject (<0.1%) treated with an active 
comparator. Among the 7 alogliptin-treated subjects reporting at least 1 acute pancreatitis TEAE, 
3 subjects had SAEs and 2 subjects had TEAEs (pancreatitis acute and pancreatitis) that led to study drug 
discontinuation.  
In addition to the 8 subjects in the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group with pancreatitis TEAEs, as of 
23 August 2011, pancreatitis TEAEs were reported for 6 subjects in Study 402 (3 and 3 subjects, 
respectively, in the alogliptin 25 mg and placebo groups), 13 subjects in Study 012 (9 and 4 subjects, 
respectively, in the alogliptin 25 and 12.5 mg groups), and 2 subjects in the regional studies (1 subject on 
placebo in Study 308 [China] and 1 subject on alogliptin 25 mg in OCT-001 [Japan]). 
After adjusting for exposure, rates of pancreatitis adverse events were 0, 0.1, 0.1, and 0.3 events per 100 
subject-years, respectively, for the placebo, active comparator, and alogliptin 12.5 and 25 mg groups in 
the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group. These rates are comparable to epidemiological studies that 
have shown that diabetic subjects have an increased incidence of 0.05 to 0.4 events per 100 
patient-years vs 0.02 to 0.15 events per 100 patient-years in non-diabetic subjects [48-51]. 
The frequency of pancreatitis events is low but there is an increased risk with alogliptin treatment.  
The risk of pancreatitis is included as Warning and Precautions in the SmPC, Section 4.4, and acute 
pancreatitis is listed as an adverse reaction in Post-marketing Reports in the SmPC, Section 4.8. 
Moreover, new pancreatitis data have been integrated during the procedure and hence pancreatitis is now 
included as an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. As additional pharmacovigilance activity the 
cardiovascular outcome study 402 is further investigating pancreatitis. The final study report is expected 
to be in the first quarter of 2014. 
Malignancies 
Malignancies are considered special-interest TEAEs for long-term use of DPP-4 or GLP-1 therapies. 
Alogliptin was not genotoxic in nonclinical in vitro and in vivo genotoxic studies, and no evidence of 
carcinogenicity occurred in the nonclinical studies with alogliptin. In preclinical studies a minimal to mild 
simple transitional cell hyperplasia in the urinary bladder was noted in male rats at 27-fold higher than the 
intended human exposure. Pioglitazone has been associated with bladder cancer, and therefore an 
interaction with pioglitazone can not be excluded. However, no cases of bladder cancer were reported in 
the clinical trials. 
The percentage of subjects reporting at least 1 malignancy TEAE was low in all groups (0.9% placebo, 
0.4% active comparator, 0.8% alogliptin 12.5 mg, 0.5% alogliptin 25 mg) with no imbalance in individual 
cancers.  
Based on these results showing low overall incidence, no special warning/precaution is included for 
malignancies (SmPC). 
Pancreatic Cancer 
Uncertainties remained during the procedure regarding effects of alogliptin on the pancreas, as long term 
safety data are limited. Besides, during the procedure data had been published that gave rise to additional 
concerns on inflammatory and proliferative pancreatic effects of the therapy with another DPP-4 inhibitor, 
sitagliptin, (Butler et al. Diabetes, March 2013). Therefore the applicant was asked during the assessment 
procedure to provide further analyses with regard to pancreatic risk. 
In the controlled clinical studies, including the long-term studies OPI-004 (52 weeks) and 
305 (104 weeks), there were no TEAEs of pancreatic cancer in alogliptin treatment groups. A PV database 
search found that 5 subjects had pancreatic cancer events that occurred outside of the study treatment 
period: 4 subjects had events that occurred during run-in before randomization (prior to study drug 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 79/96 
 
  
  
exposure) and 1 subject who received placebo and pioglitazone had an event spontaneously reported 
1 year after study completion. 
As of November 2012, in Study 402, there were no TEAEs of pancreatic cancer.  
A total of 5 subjects with events were reported with alogliptin in uncontrolled studies, and the incidence 
rates of pancreatic cancer for the alogliptin uncontrolled studies were considered to be consistent with the 
incidence expected in the T2DM population.  
Most postmarketing cases reported a time to onset less than 2 months from starting alogliptin or had 
pre-existing pancreatic cancer before receiving alogliptin.  
Based on these additional data the CHMP considered that there was no clear evidence for an association 
of pancreatic cancer and alogliptin treatment. Nevertheless, CHMP considered that a targeted follow-up is 
needed. This has now been reflected in the RMP as ‘Pancreatic cancer’ has been included as an important 
potential risk (in line with the recommendation given by CHMP at the July 2013 meeting for this class of 
products in the conclusions of the Art. 5(3) referral for GLP 1 based therapies). 
Hypoglycaemia  
Investigators were asked to record episodes of hypoglycaemia on a dedicated case report form (CRF). 
Three criteria were identified: 
1. 
2. 
Symptomatic hypoglycaemic episode and blood glucose <3.33 mmol/L (Mild to Moderate). 
Symptomatic or asymptomatic hypoglycaemic episode and blood glucose <2.78 mmol/L (Mild to 
Moderate). 
3. 
Any hypoglycaemic episode that required assistance, associated with a documented blood glucose 
<3.33 mmol/L (Severe). 
The incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes in the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group (excluding Study 
301 as detailed information regarding hypoglycaemic episodes was not collected in this study) was 12.9% 
in the active comparator group, 3.6% in the alogliptin 25 mg group, and 6.2% in the placebo group. 
Within each treatment group, the highest numbers of hypoglycaemic episodes were classified as 
symptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes with a blood glucose <3.33 mmol/L. Although the incidence of 
severe hypoglycaemic episodes was low overall, the percentages in the placebo and active comparator 
groups (both 0.4%) were higher than for subjects treated with alogliptin (0.1%). From this pooled 
analysis, across the alogliptin clinical development program, alogliptin treatment does not lead to an 
increased risk of hypoglycaemia when compared with placebo or active comparator. 
From the main individual placebo-controlled studies covering use as add-on to MET (008) and add-on to 
SU (007), there was no consistent indication of an increase in hypoglycaemia risk or severity by the 
addition of alogliptin 25 mg. The level of HbA1c on entry, being at the lower end of the diabetic range, did 
not appear to unduly influence hypoglycaemia rates or severity.  
In Study 007 (add-on to SU), fewer subjects in the alogliptin 25 mg group (9.6%) experienced a 
hypoglycaemic event compared with placebo (11.1%). The noticeably higher rates in the placebo and 
alogliptin 12.5 mg (15.8%) arms were likely driven by the SU component.  
In the case of alogliptin 25 mg used to form triple therapy with MET and pioglitazone in Study 322OPI-004, 
there was an approximate tripling of rate of hypoglycaemic episodes (4.5%) vs dual therapy with MET and 
a higher dose of pioglitazone (1.5%). A similar trend was also seen in Study 322OPI-001, which 
compared pioglitazone and alogliptin alone and in combination as add-on therapy to MET, but with lower 
incidence rates.

In Study 009 (add-on to TZD), accurate interpretation of hypoglycaemic episode rates is complicated by 
the permitted variations in background therapy with respect to MET and SU. There were more 
hypoglycaemic episodes in the alogliptin 25 mg group (7.0%) compared to the placebo group (5.2%). 
In Study 011 (add-on to insulin, with or without MET), episodes of hypoglycaemia were anticipated due to 
the insulin background therapy in this study population. The incidence of hypoglycaemic episodes was 
higher in the alogliptin 25 mg (27.1%) and 12.5 mg (26.7%) groups vs placebo (24.0%), but the 
incidence was similar for severe cases.  
In Study 305 (alogliptin vs SU in a general adult T2DM population, on MET monotherapy), hypoglycaemia 
rates with alogliptin 25 mg vs MET+glipizide were >10-fold lower (1.4% vs 23.8%, respectively). 
Similarly, the incidence of severe hypoglycaemic episodes was greater in the MET+glipizide group (0.5%) 
compared with the MET+alogliptin 12.5 mg and MET+alogliptin 25 mg groups (0.1% and 0, respectively). 
The higher incidence of hypoglycaemia in the MET+glipizide group is consistent with the glipizide label, 
which states that hypoglycaemia is likely to occur when more than one glucose-lowering drug is used. 
In elderly subjects ≥65 years in Study 303, hypoglycaemia rates were approximately 5-fold lower for 
alogliptin 25 mg vs glipizide (5.4% vs 26.0%). There were no severe episodes of hypoglycaemia in the 
alogliptin 25 mg group, and the rate of hypoglycaemia was in line with the hypoglycaemia rates in the 
placebo and alogliptin groups reported in the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group, predominantly in 
subjects <65 years. As elderly patients with T2DM are considered more susceptible to episodes of 
hypoglycaemia than younger patients, a pooled analysis of the data from 12 studies was performed 
comparing these age groups. The overall incidence of any episode of hypoglycaemia was similar between 
subjects ≥65 years and <65 years (3.8% and 3.6%, respectively) treated with alogliptin 25 mg.  
Comparative Safety by Dose 
In most of the Phase III studies, both alogliptin 12.5 mg and 25 mg were evaluated; however, in some 
studies, particularly the longer duration studies, only 25 mg was evaluated. Therefore, for the alogliptin 
25 mg group, there were more subjects exposed overall and for longer durations compared with the 
alogliptin 12.5 mg group. 
Incidence of TEAEs was similar between the alogliptin 12.5 and 25 mg dose groups. In the Controlled 
Phase 2 and 3 Study Group, the incidence of TEAEs was 67.5% in the alogliptin 12.5 mg group (333.2 
events per 100 subject-years) and 66.6% in the alogliptin 25 mg group (342.1 events per 100 
subject-years). For SAEs, the incidence was 4.0% in the alogliptin 12.5 mg group (8.5 events per 100 
subject-years) vs 4.7% in the alogliptin 25 mg group (9.9 events per 100 subject-years). For TEAEs 
leading to discontinuation of the study drug, the incidence was 3.6% in the alogliptin 12.5 mg group 
(6.5 events per 100 subject-years) vs 4.1% in the alogliptin 25 mg group (7.1 events per 
100 subject-years). 
Common TEAEs (experienced by 3% of subjects in either dose group) were experienced by similar 
proportions of subjects in the 12.5 and 25 mg dose groups and included nasopharyngitis (5.7% vs 5.1%, 
alogliptin 12.5 mg vs 25 mg), upper respiratory tract infection (4.9% vs 5.2%), headache (4.4% vs 
5.4%), urinary tract infection (4.1% vs 4.2%), hypertension (3.6% vs 3.9%), diarrhoea (3.7% vs 3.8%), 
and back pain (3.5% vs 3.3%). No meaningful differences were observed between the dose groups in the 
analysis of common TEAEs by time to onset or by duration of exposure to treatment. In addition, no single 
type of event emerged in 1 of the 2 dose categories and not in the other.  
Similarly, the incidences of TEAEs of special interest, including hypersensitivity, acute pancreatitis, 
malignancies, and CV events were comparable between exposure-corrected dose groups. Overall, the 
safety and tolerability profile of alogliptin was similar between the 12.5 and 25 mg groups.

Laboratory findings 
For laboratory evaluations of haematology, clinical chemistry, and urinalysis, mean changes from 
baseline to Endpoint were generally small and consistent across the treatment groups. This was also the 
case for renal and hepatic function parameters. 
The incidence of markedly abnormal values for renal function parameters during treatment was low 
overall and similar across treatment groups.  
During treatment, the incidence of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >3× upper limit of normal (ULN) was 
higher in the active comparator group (2.2%) than in alogliptin or placebo groups (1.3% and 0.9%, 
respectively). The incidence of ALT >5×ULN in subjects receiving active comparator, alogliptin or placebo 
was 0.5%, 0.3%, and 0.1%, respectively. ALT >10×ULN only occurred in subjects receiving active 
comparator or alogliptin (0.2% and 0.1%, respectively). 
The incidence of total bilirubin >34.2 µmol/L was low and similar across groups (active comparator 0.5%, 
alogliptin 0.4%). The incidence of ALT >3×ULN concurrent with total bilirubin >34.2 µmol/L was 0.1% in 
the active comparator group and <0.1% in subjects receiving alogliptin. 
For the alogliptin-treated subjects with an ALT >10×ULN, all had an alternative (non-study drug) 
aetiology. Minor, transient and isolated elevations in hepatic parameters were observed in other subjects 
but most were not considered clinically meaningful in terms of observed absolute values within expected 
physiological fluctuation of these enzymes in the context of underlying liver comorbidity.  
Overall, the data indicate alogliptin is associated with a low risk of hepatic toxicity. 
Vital Signs and Electrocardiogram Evaluations  
No clinically meaningful trends were observed in vital sign measures (pulse, blood pressure, respiratory 
rate, and temperature). In addition, alogliptin was found to be weight neutral. 
Nonclinical electrophysiological studies did not raise any safety concerns. Study 019 investigated the 
effects of alogliptin on cardiac repolarization (QT/QTc) and concluded that alogliptin had no clinically 
meaningful effect on cardiac repolarization. Electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters showed no clinically 
meaningful trends.  
Safety in special populations 
To determine whether certain factors predispose subgroups of individuals to experience specific TEAEs, 
analyses were performed using the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group for a number of intrinsic (sex, 
age, race, BMI, and renal function) factors. No important differences were noted. 
Elderly 
TEAEs in the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group were reviewed by age group (<65, 65-74, 75-84, and 
≥85 years). Dizziness, headache, urinary tract infection, diarrhoea, and dyslipidaemia were consistently 
reported by a greater percentage of subjects 75-84 years compared with subjects <65 years and subjects 
65-74 years in the alogliptin 25 mg group. This trend was also evident in the active comparator group for 
dizziness. This finding is consistent with the known propensity for these conditions observed in the 
general population of elderly patients and is not attributable per se to alogliptin treatment. 
In addition, creatinine renal clearance decreased was reported by a greater percentage of subjects 75-84 
years of age compared with subjects <65 years and subjects 65-74 years in the alogliptin 25 mg group. 
This trend was also evident in the active comparator group. This subgroup difference is not unexpected 
and is unlikely to be attributable to alogliptin treatment. 
CHMP assessment report

In the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group, no safety signals were observed in subgroup populations 
stratified by age, but exposure in subjects older than 85 years of age is very limited. 
Study 303 was a randomized, double-blind, active-controlled study designed to further explore the 
efficacy and safety of alogliptin compared with glipizide over a longer period of time (up to 52 weeks) in 
an older T2DM subject population (age, 65 to 90 years). Overall, compared with glipizide, alogliptin was 
well tolerated, showed less hypoglycaemia, and no body weight increases. The safety and tolerability 
results evaluated in this study were consistent with the safety profile established for alogliptin in previous 
studies within its clinical development program. The most frequently reported TEAEs included urinary 
tract infection, dizziness, and headache, all of which are similar to glipizide and consistent with what has 
been reported in previous studies. Most other TEAEs occurred in less than 1% of subjects, were 
considered by the investigator not drug related, and were mild or moderate in intensity.  
Subjects with Impaired Renal Function 
In the phase 1 Study 006 (renal pharmacokinetic study), compared with healthy subjects, systemic 
exposure to alogliptin was 71%, 112%, 251% and 377% higher in subjects with mild, moderate, or 
severe renal impairment, and with ESRD, respectively, following administration of a single alogliptin 
50 mg dose. While no change in dose is anticipated for patients with mild renal impairment, dose 
reductions proportional to the increases in exposure in subjects with moderate or severe renal 
impairment or ESRD are recommended (SmPC). The majority of TEAEs reported in this study were judged 
to be mild in intensity and unrelated to study drug. The percentage of TEAEs was similar between each 
renal impairment group and their respective healthy matched controls. As expected, several subjects with 
renal impairment exhibited serum chemistry and urinalysis abnormalities consistent with their underlying 
condition; however, no clinically meaningful changes in any of these values were observed. 
The majority of subjects in the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group had mild or moderate renal 
impairment based on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the MDRD calculation. The 
relatively small number of subjects with severe baseline renal impairment limits the ability to make 
meaningful comparisons in this subgroup (no subjects receiving placebo or active comparator, 1 subject 
in the alogliptin 12.5 mg group, and 3 subjects in the alogliptin 25 mg group when defined by MDRD 
formula).  
In the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study group, urinary tract infection was the only common TEAE reported 
by ≥1% of subjects in the alogliptin 25 mg group for which the incidence in subjects with moderate renal 
impairment at baseline was higher than that in subjects with normal renal function or mild renal 
impairment at baseline. A similar trend was evident for subjects who received active comparator, 
indicating that this difference is not necessarily attributable to treatment with alogliptin. Similarly, 
pruritus was the only TEAE of interest reported by ≥1% of subjects overall in the alogliptin 25 mg group 
for which the incidence in subjects with either mild or moderate renal impairment at baseline was at least 
twice that in subjects with normal renal function at baseline.  
Of the TEAEs reported by ≥1% of subjects with severe renal impairment in Study 402, compared to 
placebo, alogliptin was associated with a similar percentage TEA’s (87.9 % vs. 87.9%). As expected with 
multiple comparisons, some numerical imbalances remain with the updated data set, including events in 
which incidence was lower for alogliptin compared with placebo and those with an incidence higher for 
alogliptin compared with placebo. Among the most common TEAEs (≥5% incidence), a 2-fold difference 
between treatment groups was observed for anemia, urinary tract infection, and angina pectoris (higher 
for alogliptin) and diarrhea, edema peripheral, and blood creatine phosphokinase increased (higher for 
placebo). As additional pharmacovigilance activity the cardiovascular outcome study 402 is further 
investigating effects in patients with renal impairment. The final study report is expected to be in the first 
quarter of 2014. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 83/96 
 
  
  
Subjects with Impaired Hepatic Function 
Results from phase 1 Study 023 demonstrated that mild or moderate hepatic impairment did not affect 
exposure to alogliptin; therefore, subgroup analyses were not performed for hepatic function. The effect 
of severe hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of alogliptin was not studied. As a result, use in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment is not recommended (SmPC). As additional pharmacovigilance 
activity the cardiovascular outcome study 402 is further investigating hepatotoxicity. The final study 
report is expected to be in the first quarter of 2014. 
Interactions 
Alogliptin was devoid of any clinically meaningful drug or food interactions, which suggests a favourable 
safety profile in patients with T2DM who are likely to be receiving multiple concomitant medications. 
Post marketing experience 
Alogliptin was approved for use in the treatment of T2DM in Japan in April 2010 and commercially 
launched (6.25, 12.5, and 25 mg) in June 2010.  
As of 15 October 2011, cumulative exposure for alogliptin is estimated to be 117,359 patient-years. A 
total of 271 postmarketing cases were included in the 3 PSURs, 37 of which were serious. The most 
common events reported postmarketing were in the skin and subcutaneous disorders SOC (18 serious 
and 124 nonserious cases) and included 1 case of Stevens-Johnson syndrome.  
Hepatotoxicity was reported postmarketing in 5 cases. An independent committee concluded that the 
relationship between alogliptin and hepatotoxicity in three of the five cases was deemed “probable” 
(50-74% probability) and in the remaining two was deemed “possible” (25-49% probability).  
There were 6 serious postmarketing cases of acute pancreatitis (as of 27 October 2011). All except 1 
serious postmarketing case had a possible alternative aetiology that likely precipitated the event. One 
fatal case of necrotizing pancreatitis was reported, which occurred in a patient with multiple gallbladder 
stones as evidenced by dilation of the extrahepatic common bile duct on autopsy. 
No new information affecting the safety profile of alogliptin has been identified postmarketing and no 
changes have been made to the Company Core Safety Information (CCSI). To date, no regulatory action 
has been taken by the Japanese regulatory authority with respect to safety labeling, which is based on the 
clinical trial program. 
PSURs have been produced every 6 months since approval in Japan. Categories of medically significant 
adverse reactions reviewed within each PSUR include those relating to skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders, hypoglycaemia, pancreatitis, and hepatotoxicity.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall, a comprehensive clinical program was submitted comprising 55 clinical studies involving 
approximately 1000 healthy adult subjects and more than 11,000 adult subjects with T2DM. The patient 
population seems representative of the European population of diabetes patients.  
The most common TEAEs reported in ≥5% of subjects treated with alogliptin 25 mg and more frequently 
than in subjects who received placebo or active comparators were headache, nasopharyngitis, and upper 
respiratory tract infection. In comparison to other DPP-4 inhibitors, no potential new adverse events 
emerged. In order to increase the precision of adverse event rates and to achieve a higher validity, the 
applicant was requested during the procedure to generate a safety data pool containing all 7 pivotal phase 
III studies (5 placebo-controlled and 2 active-comparator studies) and to present a table of adverse 
events to be reflected in the tabulated list of adverse reactions for section 4.8 for the proposed SmPC. The 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 84/96 
 
  
  
applicant has provided the requested safety data pool containing all pivotal phase III studies. It is agreed 
that the pattern of TEAEs in the pool ‘Pivotal Phase III Controlled Studies’ was similar to the pool 
‘Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group’. The tabulated list of ADRs in SmPC section 4.8 was updated 
accordingly to reflect data from pooled phase III studies instead of individual studies in accordance with 
the SmPC guideline.  
Serious adverse events were higher with alogliptin compared to placebo, but lower compared to active 
comparators. There was no discernible pattern in the type of adverse events. The applicant was requested 
to a more in depth discussion regarding the following 7 fatal cases, considered to be related to alogliptin 
treatment: 1 acute pancreatitis, 1 sudden death and 1 acute pulmonary oedema in the Controlled Phase 
2/3 Group and 4 fatal cases with CV outcome in the study 012.  After review of the cases, it is considered 
that these individual cases (seven classified as possibly related and one as not related) do not strongly 
reflect an association with alogliptin. Such events are expected in a population with T2DM and occurred at 
rates consistent with other studies. No apparent patterns, trends, were observed and it is considered that 
they do not indicate a new safety concern. Moreover, further results from the CV outcome study 402, for 
which a final study report is expected to be available during the first quarter of 2014, should allow a 
further in-depth characterisation of the CV profile of  alogliptin-containing products. 
Pre-defined special-interest AEs for alogliptin were CV (MACE), hypersensitivity reactions (severe 
cutaneous adverse reactions, angioedema, and anaphylaxis reactions), acute pancreatitis, and 
malignancies. 
Cardiovascular safety 
In the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group, when compared to placebo, alogliptin was associated with 
a higher cardiovascular event rate (Hazard ratio 1.33). However, in the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study 
Group, cardiovascular event rate was lower compared to active comparators (Hazard ratio 0.66). In 
addition, interim analyses of the cardiovascular outcome study (study 402) demonstrated that alogliptin 
was associated with a lower cardiovascular risk (Hazard ratio 0.81). 
Owing to the differences in the number of events for MI (10 vs. 6), cardiac failure (7 vs. 1) and cardiac 
failure congestive (14 vs. 7) in the table presenting TAES vs. the table presenting serious TEAEs) in the 
SOC cardiac disorders, the CHMP did seek clarification during the procedure on the cases of cardiac failure 
and myocardial infarction designated as non serious. The applicant stated that there were 20 subjects in 
total in the alogliptin clinical studies who experienced adverse events (AEs) of cardiac failure/cardiac 
failure congestive (14 subjects) or myocardial infarction (6 subjects) in which the event had been 
classified by the investigator as non serious. The applicant did provide satisfactory details of the definition 
of SAEs, a clinical review of the available data that was performed and a rationale for the non serious 
designation. Similarly, reassuring descriptions were provided by the applicant for the cases of heart 
failure, and therefore the CHMP considered this concern as being resolved.  
Hypersensitivity reactions  
Safety results for alogliptin indicate a low incidence of hypersensitivity reactions. Nevertheless, 13 
patients (0.2%) developed an anaphylactic reaction during alogliptin, whereas no patient developed an 
anaphylactic reaction during treatment with placebo. During postmarketing surveillance in Japan, skin 
disorders, including Stevens Johnson, were reported. Consistent with labeling for other DPP-4 inhibitors 
such reactions have been mentioned in the SmPC (4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use). 
Pancreatitis 
The frequency of pancreatitis events is low, but alogliptin was associated with a higher risk for pancreatitis 
in comparison to comparators. Several cases of pancreatitis were reported post-marketing of which one 
was fatal. Given the increased risk of pancreatitis reported with other DPP-4 inhibitors, the risk of 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 85/96 
 
  
  
pancreatitis is included as Warning and Precautions in the SmPC, Section 4.4, and acute pancreatitis is 
listed as an adverse reaction in Post-marketing Reports in the SmPC, Section 4.8.  Moreover, new 
pancreatitis data have been integrated during the procedure and hence pancreatitis is now included as an 
identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Malignancies 
There is no safety signal for malignancies with alogliptin. Therefore, no special warning/precaution is 
necessary for malignancies. 
Pancreatic Cancer 
Uncertainties remained during the procedure regarding effects of alogliptin on the pancreas, as long term 
safety data are limited. Besides, during the procedure data had been published that gave rise to additional 
concerns on inflammatory and proliferative pancreatic effects of the therapy with another DPP-4 inhibitor, 
sitagliptin, (Butler et al. Diabetes, March 2013). Therefore the applicant was asked during the assessment 
procedure to provide further analyses with regard to pancreatic risk. 
In the controlled clinical studies, including the long-term studies OPI-004 (52 weeks) and 
305 (104 weeks), there were no TEAEs of pancreatic cancer in alogliptin treatment groups. A PV database 
search found that 5 subjects had pancreatic cancer events that occurred outside of the study treatment 
period. As of November 2012, in Study 402, there were no TEAEs of pancreatic cancer. In uncontrolled 
studies, the incidence rates of pancreatic cancer associated with the use of alogliptin were low and 
considered to be consistent with the incidence expected in the T2DM population.  
Based on these additional data the CHMP considered that there was no clear evidence for an association 
of pancreatic cancer and alogliptin treatment. Nevertheless, CHMP considered that a targeted follow-up is 
needed. This has now been reflected in the RMP as ‘Pancreatic cancer’ has been included as an important 
potential risk (in line with the recommendation given by CHMP at the July 2013 meeting for this class of 
products in the conclusions of the Art. 5(3) referral for GLP 1 based therapies). 
Hypoglycaemia 
There was no increase in hypoglycaemia rate vs placebo when alogliptin 25 mg was administered alone, 
added on to SU, or added on to metformin. In the case of alogliptin 25 mg used to form triple therapy with 
metformin and pioglitazone in Study 322OPI-004, there was an increased rate of hypoglycaemic episodes. 
In Study 009 (add-on to TZD), there was a small increase in the rate of hypoglycaemic episodes in the 
alogliptin 25 mg group. In Study 011 (add-on to insulin, with or without metformin), the incidence of 
hypoglycaemic episodes was higher with alogliptin 25 mg vs placebo. This increased rate of 
hypoglycaemia in combination with metformin/TZD and insulin is mentioned in the SmPC. 
Vital signs and ECG  
There were no relevant changes in vital signs and ECG. There were no relevant changes in laboratory 
findings. 
Subgroups 
In patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency, no safety signals were observed with alogliptin. The 
number of patients with severe renal insufficiency in the pivotal studies was negligible. In the 
cardiovascular outcome study 402, a number of patients with severe renal insufficiency were included. Of 
the TEAEs reported by ≥1% of subjects with severe renal impairment, compared to placebo, alogliptin 
was associated with a similar percentage TEA’s (87.9 % vs. 87.9%).  
No safety signals for alogliptin were observed in subgroup populations stratified by age. Some adverse 
events were more common with alogliptin in elderly individuals. However, the number of patients was 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 86/96 
 
  
  
limited, and the differences between alogliptin and placebo were small. Overall, no safety signals were 
observed with alogliptin in subgroup populations stratified by race. In addition, no safety signals were 
observed with alogliptin in subgroup populations stratified by BMI. 
Patients with hepatic disease were excluded in the phase 2 and 3 studies. In a pharmacokinetic study in 
patients with moderate hepatic impairment, there were no adverse events and no clinically meaningful 
changes in laboratory tests were reported. However, the use of alogliptin in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment can not be recommended. In addition, five cases of hepatotoxicity, including one case of 
hepatic failure were  reported postmarketing. An independent committee concluded that the relationship 
between alogliptin and hepatotoxicity in three of the five cases was deemed “probable” (50-74% 
probability) and in the remaining two was deemed “possible” (25-49% probability). Although no causal 
relationship between alogliptin and hepatic dysfunction has been established, these 5 cases provide 
important knowledge about the risks of alogliptin in clinical practice. Therefore, hepatic dysfunction has 
been included in the SmPC in section 4.4 (warnings and precautions) and 4.8 (undesirable effects). 
Furthermore, hepatotoxicity is included in the RMP as important potential risk. 
Drug interactions  
No dose adjustment is required due to drug interactions. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of alogliptin was similar to other DPP-4 inhibitors with no potential new safety adverse 
events identified. 
The cases of hepatotoxicity, observed post-marketing in Japan, are relevant. Therefore, hepatic 
dysfunction has been included in the SmPC in section 4.4 (warnings and precautions) and 4.8 
(undesirable effects). Furthermore, hepatotoxicity is included in the RMP as important potential risk. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements.    
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 4.0, the PRAC considers by consensus 
that the risk management system for alogliptin (Vipidia) indicated in adults aged 18 years and older with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control in combination with other glucose lowering 
medicinal products including insulin, when these, together with diet and exercise, do not provide 
adequate glycaemic control is acceptable. 
This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan:

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed post-authorisation 
PhV development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product.

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk minimisation 
measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication(s). 
In addition the PRAC considered that the applicant should address the following points 
 
 
Pancreatic cancer should be included in the RMP as missing information 
Pancreatic cancer should be added as an adverse event of special interest in the CV outcome study 
402.   
The CHMP endorsed this advice with changes. 
These changes concerned the following elements of the Risk Management Plan: 
 
Pancreatic cancer should be included in the RMP as an important potential risk   
The CHMP justified these changes as follows: 
The Article 5 (3) referral procedure assessing the available data concerning the potential relationship 
between pancreatic cancer and GLP-1 agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors treatment, was concluded during July 
2013 CHMP meeting. In line with the recommendation given by CHMP in the conclusion of the above 
mentioned Art. 5(3) referral procedure “pancreatic cancer” should be seen as a potential risk associated 
with alogliptin treatment and reflected as such in all alogliptin containing products’ RMPs. 
CHMP assessment report

All issues identified by the PRAC and the CHMP were properly addressed by the applicant and an updated 
RMP version 5 was submitted. 
The CHMP endorsed the updated RMP without changes. 
2.9.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Alogliptin is a selective, orally administered, xanthine-based DPP-4 inhibitor that lowers blood glucose 
levels by augmenting the glucose-stimulated insulin release through increased levels of endogenous 
GLP-1. 
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
Efficacy and safety of alogliptin were studied in an extensive number of double blind randomized trials, 
including trials with placebo and active comparators, and in combination with several other antidiabetic 
agents. HbA1c was used as the primary endpoint. In the placebo controlled studies, the treatment effect 
of alogliptin was modest (0.5-0.6%), but clinically relevant. 
A monotherapy indication was not requested. However, a monotherapy study (010) comparing 
alogliptin with placebo is submitted. Compared to placebo, alogliptin 25 mg was associated with a 
reduction in HbA1c of -0.57% (-0.80 to -0.35) after 26 weeks. 
For the combination with metformin, study 008 demonstrated that the treatment effect of alogliptin 
25 mg was -0.48% (95% CI -0.67 to -0.30) in comparison to placebo after 26 weeks. 
For the combination with SU, pivotal study 007 is submitted. In this study, alogliptin is compared to 
placebo in patients treated with SU. For the combination with SU, the treatment effect of alogliptin 25 mg 
was -0.53% (95% CI -0.73 to -0.33) after 26 weeks in comparison to placebo. 
For the combination with TZD (with or without metformin), pivotal study 009 is submitted. 
Alogliptin 25 mg was associated with a reduction in HbA1c of -0.61% (95% CI -0.80 to -0.41) after 26 
weeks in comparison to placebo. Treatment effects were clinically relevant for alogliptin 25 mg in 
combination with TZD only (-0.49%) and in combination with TZD and metformin (-0.72%). In addition, 
in study 322OPI-004, the effects of adding alogliptin 25 mg were non-inferior compared with increasing 
the dose of pioglitazone from 30 to 45 mg. 
For the combination with insulin, study 011 was submitted. Treatment effect of alogliptin 25 mg was 
modest, but clinically relevant (-0.59%; 95% CI -0.80 to -0.37) after 26 weeks. Baseline HbA1c values 
were relatively high (9.3%). This may have resulted in an overestimation of the treatment effects of 
alogliptin on HbA1c. Nevertheless, in the individuals with HbA1c below 8.5%, the effect of alogliptin 25 
mg on HbA1c was also clinically relevant (-0.68%).  
Secondary endpoints 
The results of the analysis of the effects of alogliptin on fasting plasma glucose and the need for rescue 
therapy were in line with the effects on HbA1c. Alogliptin was not associated with weight gain in most 
CHMP assessment report

Page 90/96 
 
  
  
studies. However, in combination with SU, alogliptin was associated with an LS mean difference from 
placebo in weight of +0.8 and +0.9 kg for the alogliptin 12.5 and 25 mg dose levels. There were no 
important effects on serum lipids. Compared with placebo, alogliptin 25 mg was associated with 
statistically significant reductions from baseline in HbA1c and postprandial total triglycerides levels. 
Initial combination studies 
In an initial combination study, both coadministration therapy regimens of alogliptin plus metformin 
(Alogliptin 12.5 mg + Met 500 mg BID and Alogliptin 12.5 mg + Met 1000 mg BID) resulted in larger 
reductions in HbA1c compared to their individual component regimens of alogliptin alone or metformin 
alone. Alogliptin 12.5 mg BID provided similar glycaemic control compared with alogliptin 25 mg once 
daily. In patients inadequately controlled with metformin, each individual combination of 
Alogliptin+Pioglitazone achieved larger reductions in HbA1c at Week 26 compared with the corresponding 
alogliptin and pioglitazone doses given alone. These differences were clinically relevant. The initial 
combination of alogliptin and pioglitazone was associated with a reduction in HbA1c that was larger than 
that with alogliptin and pioglitazone monotherapy. These data provide further support for the use of 
alogliptin in combination with metformin and/or pioglitazone, but initial combination therapy was not an 
indication requested by the applicant and is not in line with current diabetes treatment guidelines. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Cardiovascular beneficial effects 
In the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study Group, when compared to placebo, alogliptin was associated with 
a higher cardiovascular event rate (Hazard ratio 1.33). However, in the Controlled Phase 2 and 3 Study 
Group, cardiovascular event rate was lower compared to active comparators (Hazard ratio 0.8). In 
addition, interim analyses of the cardiovascular outcome study demonstrated that alogliptin was 
associated with a lower cardiovascular risk (Hazard ratio 0.81). 
Non-inferiority compared to glipizide 
According to the diabetes guideline (CPMP/EWP/1080/00) non-inferiority of the new agent to an 
established active comparator as add-on to monotherapy (representing standard of care) should be 
demonstrated. In this case, standard of care would be metformin + SU. For the combination with 
metformin, in the on-going non-inferiority trial, both alogliptin 25 mg and glipizide were associated with 
a clinically relevant reduction in HbA1c (-0.61% and -0.52%, respectively) after 52 weeks. However, 
baseline HbA1c was relatively low in these patients (7.6%). This decreases the power to detect any 
differences between treatments. In addition, the glipizide dose in the comparator group was relatively low 
(mean dose 5.2 mg). This is probably due to the dose titration algorithm. Following any dose-titration, a 
subject who experienced hypoglycaemia was allowed to reduce the dose to as low as 5 mg glipizide (or 
matching placebo) and continue the study on that dose. Following down titration, subjects were not 
allowed to increase the dose again. With such a low HbA1c and low dose of glipizide, the CHMP concluded 
that non-inferiority of alogliptin when compared to SU as add-on therapy to metformin has not been 
established. 
Renal impairment 
Renal dose adjustment recommendations of alogliptin 12.5 mg and alogliptin 6.25 mg, respectively, for 
patients with moderate and severe renal impairment/ESRD are based on PK data. In the pivotal trials, 
efficacy was not importantly influenced by mild or moderate renal impairment, but patients with severe 
renal impairment were not included in these pivotal trials. In a supportive ongoing trial with patients with 
a recent acute coronary syndrome, the treatment effect of alogliptin 6.25 mg was shown to be relevant in 
patients with severe renal insufficiency.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 91/96 
 
  
  
Elderly individuals 
Diabetes mellitus type 2 is a disease that is especially prevalent in elderly individuals. In the pivotal trials, 
the treatment effect of alogliptin was not lower in patients >65 years compared to patients <65 years. 
However, only 2% of the patients treated with alogliptin were >75 years of age (n=124). Therefore, a 
study in elderly individuals was performed (study 303). Although alogliptin 25 mg and glipizide were 
statistically non-inferior, the absolute changes in HbA1c after 1 year were clinically not relevant. The fact 
that these results were observed in both treatment groups indicates that the observed efficacy response 
might be related to the specific study design, for example, the low baseline HbA1c and the inclusion of 
subjects on monotherapy (with a short period of background therapy washout). Importantly, however, 
results of the large pooled analysis of the 5 main Phase III, 26-week, placebo-controlled studies, 
demonstrate relevant efficacy in the elderly, also in patients aged ≥75 years. 
Statistical considerations 
Analysis of change from baseline in HbA1c (primary endpoint) was based on FAS (placebo-controlled 
studies) or PPS (active-comparator studies) with the LOCF. This is accepted. However, more subjects in 
the placebo group than in the treatment group discontinued the study, particularly due to hyperglycaemic 
rescue. This was according to protocol, and was thus not considered a major protocol deviation (i.e. these 
patients would still be included in the PPS) but could have led to an overestimation of the treatment effect.  
Effect of race 
The majority of the patients were White. In the pooled data, the treatment effect of alogliptin 25 mg in 
Whites is clinically relevant (-0.50%). Subgroup analyses in the individual main studies demonstrate that 
the effect is of borderline relevance for some of the requested indications. Specifically, for alogliptin 
add-on to SU (study 007), the treatment effect of alogliptin 25 mg is -0.38%. For alogliptin add-on to 
metformin (study 008), the treatment effect of alogliptin 25 mg is -0.36%.  
Long term effects 
Although the extension study (study 012) was not intended for efficacy evaluation, after 4 years, the 
increase in HbA1c with alogliptin 25 mg over time was clinically relevant (+0.61%). In addition, in study 
303 in elderly individuals, efficacy after 1 year was small, but stable. In the two main non-inferiority trials 
(study 004 and 305) after 1 year, treatment effects of alogliptin were relatively stable compared to 
glipizide (study 305) and compared to increasing the dose of pioglitazone (study 004).  
Effects on beta cell function 
There tended to be effects on estimates of endocrine pancreatic function. However, these effects were not 
statistically significant in the majority of the studies. In addition, these serum measures (such as fasting 
proinsulin, fasting insulin, proinsulin/insulin ratio, C peptide and HOMA) are only surrogate estimates of 
pancreatic function. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Overall, a comprehensive clinical program was submitted comprising 55 clinical studies involving 
approximately 1000 healthy adult subjects and more than 11,000 adult subjects with T2DM. The patient 
population seems representative of the European population of diabetes patients. 
The most common TEAEs reported in ≥5% of subjects treated with alogliptin 25 mg and more frequently 
than in subjects who received placebo or active comparators were headache, nasopharyngitis, and upper 
CHMP assessment report

respiratory tract infection. In comparison to other DPP-4 inhibitors, no potential new adverse events 
emerged in the phase 2 and 3 studies.  
Serious adverse events were higher with alogliptin compared to placebo, but lower compared to active 
comparators. There was no discernible pattern in the type of adverse events. 
Hypersensitivity reactions  
Safety results for alogliptin indicate a low incidence of hypersensitivity reactions. Nevertheless, 13 
patients (0.2%) developed an anaphylactic reaction during alogliptin, whereas no patient developed an 
anaphylactic reaction during treatment with placebo. During postmarketing surveillance in Japan, skin 
disorders, including Stevens Johnson, were reported. Consistent with labeling for other DPP-4 inhibitors 
such reactions are now mentioned in the SmPC. 
Pancreatitis 
The frequency of pancreatitis events is low, but alogliptin was associated with a higher risk for pancreatitis 
in comparison to comparators. Several cases of pancreatitis were reported postmarketing of which one 
was fatal. Given the increased risk of pancreatitis reported with other DPP-4 inhibitors, the risk of 
pancreatitis is included as Warning and Precautions in the SmPC, Section 4.4, and acute pancreatitis is 
listed as an adverse reaction in Postmarketing Reports in the SmPC, Section 4.8. Moreover, pancreatitis 
is now included as an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan. 
Malignancies 
There is no safety signal for malignancies with alogliptin. Therefore, no special warning/precaution is 
necessary for malignancies. 
Based on all available data the CHMP considered that there was no clear evidence for an association of 
pancreatic cancer and alogliptin treatment. Nevertheless, ‘Pancreatic cancer’ has been included in the 
Risk Management Plan as an important potential risk (in line with the recommendation given by CHMP at 
the July 2013 meeting for this class of products in the conclusions of the Art. 5(3) referral for GLP 1 based 
therapies). 
Hypoglycaemia 
There was no increase in hypoglycaemia rate vs placebo when alogliptin 25 mg was administered alone, 
added on to SU, or added on to metformin. In the case of alogliptin 25 mg used for triple therapy with 
metformin and pioglitazone in Study 322OPI-004, there was an increased rate of hypoglycaemic episodes. 
In Study 009 (add-on to TZD), there was a small increase in the rate of hypoglycaemic episodes in the 
alogliptin 25 mg group. In Study 011 (add-on to insulin, with or without metformin), the incidence of 
hypoglycaemic episodes was higher with alogliptin 25 mg vs placebo.  
Subgroups 
No safety signals for alogliptin were observed in subgroup populations stratified by age. Some adverse 
events were more common with alogliptin in elderly individuals. However, the number of patients was 
limited, and the differences between alogliptin and placebo were small. Overall, no safety signals were 
observed with alogliptin in subgroup populations stratified by race. In addition, no safety signals were 
observed with alogliptin in subgroup populations stratified by BMI. 
CHMP assessment report

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Patients with renal insufficiency 
In patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency, no safety signals were observed with alogliptin. The 
number of patients with severe renal insufficiency in the pivotal studies was negligible. In the 
cardiovascular outcome study, 87 patients with severe renal insufficiency were studied for 6 months (43 
treated with alogliptin and 44 treated with placebo). Of the TEAEs reported by ≥1% of subjects with 
severe renal impairment, compared to placebo, alogliptin was associated with a similar percentage TEA’s 
(87.9 % vs. 87.9%). 
Patients with hepatic disease  
Patients with hepatic disease were excluded in the phase 2 and 3 studies. In a pharmacokinetic study in 
patients with moderate hepatic impairment, there were no adverse events and no clinically meaningful 
changes in laboratory tests were reported. Patients with severe hepatic impairment were not 
investigated. In addition, five cases of hepatotoxicity, including one case of hepatic failure, were  reported 
postmarketing in Japan.  An independent committee concluded that the relationship between alogliptin 
and hepatotoxicity in three of the five cases was deemed “probable” (50-74% probability) and in the 
remaining two were deemed “possible” (25-49% probability). Within the context of the reassuring hepatic 
safety database for the controlled clinical trials, and the lack of a “signature” presentation among 
alogliptin associated liver events according to the committee treatment does not reach a “threshold of 
concern regarding black box warnings, restrictions on usage, or monitoring requirements”. Although no 
causal relationship between alogliptin and hepatic dysfunction has been established, these 5 cases 
provide important knowledge about the risks of alogliptin in clinical practice. Therefore, hepatic 
dysfunction has been included in the SmPC in section 4.4 (warnings and precautions) and 4.8 
(undesirable effects). Furthermore, hepatotoxicity is included in the RMP as important potential risk. 
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The efficacy of alogliptin with respect to HbA1c appears modest, but similar to that of other DPP-4 
inhibitors and of clinical relevance. In addition, similar to other DPP-4 inhibitors, alogliptin is not 
associated with weight gain, and there were no detrimental effects on blood pressure and serum lipids. 
The treatment effect on HbA1c in Whites was relatively weak for the combination of alogliptin with SU or 
Metformin, but the differences compared to other ethnic groups were small, and even less pronounced in 
other studies. 
The negligible efficiency after 1 year in elderly individuals in study 305 was unexpected, but results of the 
large pooled analysis of the 5 main Phase III, 26-week, placebo-controlled studies, demonstrate 
sufficiently relevant efficacy in the elderly, also in patients aged ≥75 years.  
The main goal of treatment of diabetes is the prevention of cardiovascular events. HbA1c is only a 
surrogate endpoint. A beneficial effect of alogliptin on cardiovascular events has not been shown. 
Nevertheless, interim analyses of the cardiovascular outcome study demonstrated that alogliptin was 
associated with a lower cardiovascular risk (Hazard ratio 0.81). A final study report is expected to be 
available during the first quarter of 2014. 
In the relatively small number of patients with severe renal insufficiency, efficacy was acceptable and 
adverse events were similar between alogliptin and placebo. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/207780/2013 
Page 94/96 
 
  
  
 
Alogliptin was associated with several relatively minor adverse events, such as headache, 
nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infection. In comparison to other DPP-4 inhibitors, no 
potential new adverse events emerged.  
DPP-4 inhibitors in general have been associated with a potential risk of developing acute pancreatitis. 
Similar to other DPP-4 inhibitors, alogliptin is associated with pancreatitis. In addition, there have been 
spontaneously reported adverse reactions of acute pancreatitis with alogliptin in the postmarketing 
setting in Japan. However, these events were rare, and consistent with labeling for other DPP-4 inhibitors 
the risk of pancreatitis is included as Warning and Precautions in the SmPC, Section 4.4,  and acute 
pancreatitis is listed as an adverse reaction in Postmarketing Reports in SmPC, Section 4.8.  Pancreatitis 
is included as an identified risk in the Risk Management Plan, into which new pancreatitis data has been 
integrated during the procedure. 
The risk of hypoglycaemia for alogliptin in combination with metformin and SU is only slightly increased. 
Alogliptin was not associated with weight gain in most studies. However, in the placebo-controlled 
studies, alogliptin administered as add-on therapy with SU was associated with weight gain. However, the 
size of this effect is relatively small.  
There is insufficient knowledge about efficacy and safety in patients with severe hepatic disease. The use 
of alogliptin in patients with severe hepatic impairment can not be recommended. This is stated in the 
SmPC. In addition, hepatotoxicity was reported postmarketing in Japan.  A relation with treatment with 
alogliptin cannot be ruled out but the hepatic safety database for the controlled clinical trials is considered 
reassuring.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Overall, the benefit-risk balance is considered positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of Vipidia in the treatment of adults aged 18 years and older with type 2 
diabetes mellitus to improve glycaemic control in combination with other glucose lowering medicinal 
products including insulin, when these, together with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate 
glycaemic control (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 for available data on different combinations) is 
favourable and therefore recommends  the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions:

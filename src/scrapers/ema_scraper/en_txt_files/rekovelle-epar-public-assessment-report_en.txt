2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Secretion of gonadotropins is controlled by GnRH (gonadotropin releasing hormone) produced in the 
hypothalamus. Human FSH is secreted by the anterior pituitary gland and in women it stimulates follicular 
development, by acting on FSH receptors in the ovaries.    
Controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) with gonadotropins aims to obtain an adequate number of oocytes to be 
used for Assisted Reproductive Technologies (ART) procedures such as in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or 
intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). COS is indicated in women suffering from infertility or with partners 
diagnosed with male infertility.   
Follitropin delta (active substance contained in REKOVELLE) is a human recombinant follicle-stimulating 
hormone (FSH) belonging to the pharmacotherapeutic class of gonadotropins. Follitropin delta is derived from a 
host cell line of human fetal retinal origin (PER.C6®). Other human recombinant FSH already available on the 
European market, i.e. follitropin alfa (Gonal-F) and follitropin beta (Puregon) and their biosimilar preparations, 
are derived from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell lines. FSH derived from human menopausal urine is also 
available on the European market. 
The amino acid sequences of the two FSH subunits in follitropin delta are identical to the human FSH sequences 
and those in CHO-derived recombinant FSH products. The expressing cell line can influence the characteristics 
of the recombinant FSH, and differences in glycosylation profile, sialic acid pattern and isoform profile. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
This recombinant gonadrotropin is intended to induce controlled ovarian stimulation for the development of 
multiple follicles in women suffering of infertility and undergoing assisted reproductive technologies (ART).  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
One in six couples worldwide experience some form of infertility problem at least once during their reproductive 
lifetime. The current prevalence of infertility lasting for at least 12 months is estimated to be 15% in developed 
countries and around 9% worldwide for women aged 20-44 years (90 million people worldwide). Not all infertile 
couples seek treatment. In 2007 it was reported that only 51 to 56% are actual seeking treatment and of those 
only 22% actually received treatment.  
Infertility most commonly applied in women aged between 30 and 39 years with a median age of 35 years. 
The endogenous risk factors are delayed child bearing linked to decrease in fertility with advancing age. 
The exogenous risk factors are gynaecological problems such as pelvic infection, tubal damage, endometriosis, 
fibroids, and ovulation problems which all tend to increase with age.  
Fertility may also be hampered by life style factors like smoking, alcohol abuse, overweight and stress. 
The reasons for infertility can involve one or both partners i.e.: 
- 
- 
 In about one-third of cases, the cause of infertility involves only the male. 
 In about one-third of cases, the cause of infertility involves only the female. 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 8/95 
  
  
  
- 
 In the remaining cases, the cause of infertility involves both the male and female, or no cause can be 
identified (unexplained infertility). 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
The definition of infertility may differ in different parts of the world. In Europe, the World Health Organisation 
(WHO) definition is generally accepted: ‘Infertility is a disease of the reproductive system defined by the failure 
to achieve a clinical pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse”. 
2.1.4.  Management 
Controlled ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins aims to obtain an adequate number of competent oocytes to 
be used for ART procedures such as IVF/ICSI with minimum risks for the woman. Females of infertile couples 
undergoing COS are treated with recombinant or urinary follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and human 
menotropin gonadotropin (hMG) to induce multiple follicle development to obtain a number of oocytes, 
preferably 8 to 14. If the cause of infertility is related to abnormal sperm production or function (male factor), 
the oocytes are usually fertilised by ICSI and if the cause of infertility is strictly related to female factors, oocytes 
may be fertilised by conventional IVF. Even though the outcome rates with each technique are comparable, the 
most common fertilisation technique is ICSI. Overall, ICSI accounts for around two-thirds of all treatments 
worldwide, and conventional IVF around one-third. However, these proportions vary greatly between countries. 
In Europe, several follitropin-containing products are available with an indication in the controlled ovarian 
stimulation for the development of multiple follicles in women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies 
(ART). 
About the product 
REKOVELLE (Follitropin delta, FSH delta, FE 999049) is presented as a solution for injection intended for 
subcutaneous administration. The product is filled in cartridges for use in an injection pen. There are three 
cartridges delivering respectively 12 micrograms, 36 micrograms and 72 micrograms of follitropin delta (the 
concentration of follitropin delta is 33.3 micrograms/mL solution for injection).  
Proposed indication 
The proposed indication for REKOVELLE is Controlled ovarian stimulation for the development of multiple 
follicles in women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies (ART) such as an in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or 
intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycle.  
Approved indication 
Controlled ovarian stimulation for the development of multiple follicles in women undergoing assisted 
reproductive technologies (ART) such as an in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) 
cycle. 
There is no clinical trial experience with REKOVELLE in the long GnRH agonist protocol. 
Posology 
The Applicant has developed an individualised dosing regimen based on serum anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) 
concentrations and body weight. For women with AMH <15 pmol/L the daily dose is 12 micrograms, irrespective 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 9/95 
  
  
  
of body weight. For women with AMH ≥15 pmol/L the daily dose decreases from 0.19 to 0.10 micrograms/kg by 
increasing AMH concentration. The individual daily dose is to be maintained throughout the stimulation period.   
Type of Application and aspects on development 
Development program 
Ferring has completed four phase 1 trials, one phase 2 trial and two phase 3 trials as part of the clinical 
development programme for follitropin delta. Two trials have been designed specifically for the clinical 
development of follitropin delta in Japan, and include a completed phase 1 trial and an ongoing phase 2 
dose-response trial in Japanese IVF/ICSI patients. 
ESTHER-1 is the pivotal efficacy trial designed to demonstrate non-inferiority of follitropin delta versus an 
approved recombinant FSH preparation with ongoing pregnancy rate and ongoing implantation rate as 
co-primary endpoints. ESTHER-2 is a safety immunogenicity trial covering up to two repeated treatment cycles 
in patients who did not achieve an ongoing pregnancy in ESTHER-1. 
Compliance with CHMP guidance 
There are no CHMP guidelines or recommendations for the proposed indication specific for the clinical 
development of follitropin delta. There are however other specific EMA Guidelines particularly relevant for the 
current application e.g.: 
• 
• 
• 
EMA Points to consider in application with 1 metanalyses; 2 single pivotal study (CHMP/EWP/2330/99) 
EMA Guideline on the choice of the non-inferiority margin (Doc. Ref. EMEA/CPMP/EWP/2158/99).  
EMA Guideline on immunogenicity of biotechnology-derived therapeutic proteins (Doc Ref. 
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006). 
Compliance with scientific advice 
EMA Scientific Advice (2013) 
As the application is supported by one pivotal study, it was requested that the pivotal efficacy trial had to be 
compelling with respect to internal and external validity, clinical relevance, statistical significance, data quality 
and  internal  consistency.  CHMP  also  recommended  that  two  co-primary  endpoints  are  included  to  ensure 
robustness of the conclusions. Thus the two co-primary endpoints in the pivotal efficacy trial ESTHER-1 were 
ongoing pregnancy rate and ongoing implantation rate. 
The non-inferiority limit for the difference between follitropin delta and Gonal-F (- 8.0%) was endorsed at the 
EMA SA. Furthermore, it was recommended to investigate the impact of infertility diagnosis, smoking history 
and number of previous pregnancies on treatment outcome, and sensitivity analyses evaluating the potential 
impact on the co-primary endpoints were therefore conducted. 
Within the EMA Scientific Advice the applicant was invited to discuss the possibility to use other established and 
CE-marked AMH assays than the one developed by Roche (ELECSYS AMH Plus immunoassay).

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
REKOVELLE is composed of Follitropin delta, ATC code: G03GA10, also known as FE 999049. Follitropin delta is 
derived from a host cell line of human origin (PER.C6®). It is supplied as a solution for injection in a multidose 
cartridge intended for subcutaneous administration. A safety evaluation of the impurities specific to the finished 
product, also referred as drug product (DP) by the applicant, showed no safety concerns in FE 999049 DP.  
REKOVELLE is provided as 3 presentations delivering 12, 36 and 72 micrograms of follitropin delta. The cartridge 
contains 33.3µg/mL of FE 999049, also referred as drug substance (DS) by the applicant, with phenol, 
polysorbate 20, L-methionine, sodium sulfate decahydrate, disodium hydrogen phosphate dodecahydrate, 
phosphoric acid concentrated, and sodium hydroxide and water for injections. In addition to the cartridge, the 
delivery system consists of an injection pen and an injection needle. The injection needles are supplied with the 
cartridge. The information provided confirms that the delivery system is suitable for its intended use. A dose 
calculator application, to be used by the Health Care Professionals in conjunction with Roche’s Elecsys 
anti-Müllerian hormone diagnostic assay, is presented. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
Follitropin delta is a recombinant follicle-stimulating-hormone (FSH) expressed in PER.C6 cell line. The 
glycoprotein is composed of two non-covalently bound polypeptide chains, denoted alfa (α) and beta (β). The α 
subunit contains 92 amino acid residues with 5 intrachain-disulphide bonds. The β subunit contains 111 amino 
acid residues with 6 intrachain-disulphide bonds. Each subunit is N-glycosylated at two positions, and about 
40% of the total mass is carbohydrates. The amino acid sequence of follitropin delta is identical to the 
endogenous human FSH sequence for both α and β subunits, and to existing Chinese hamster ovary 
(CHO)-derived recombinant FSH products. FE 999049 contains both α2,3 and α2,6 sialylation patterns, while 
CHO-derived rFSH products exclusively carry α2,3 linked sialic acid.  
The molecular formula and average formula weight of the protein backbone (reduced, nonalkylated) for the α 
and β subunits are: α subunit: C437H682N122O134S13; 10,206 Da; β subunit: C538H833N145O171S13; 12,485 Da. 
The molecular weights of the deglycosylated amino acid alkylated backbones of the α and β subunits are 10,779 
and 13,173 Daltons, respectively. Expected MW values are inclusive of an additional 57 Da per alkylated 
cysteine residue in subunit α (10 cysteines) and subunit β (12 cysteines). The average molecular weights of the 
glycosylated α and β subunits are approximately 15,200 and 18,500 Daltons, respectively. Thus, approximately 
40 % of the total molecular weight of the molecule is due to glycosylation.  
The features of the DS have been appropriately described. 
Manufacture 
The  DS  is  manufactured  by  Bio-Technology  General  (Israel).  A  valid  GMP  certificate  issued  under  the  ACAA 
agreement  (Agreements  on  Conformity  Assessment  and  Acceptance  of  Industrial  Products)  permitting  this 
activity  has  been  provided.  The  site(s)  responsible  for  DS  release  and  stability  testing  are  specified.  A  QP 
declaration stating that the DS is manufactured in compliance with the principles and guidelines on GMP for 
starting materials has been provided, detailing all sites involved in the manufacture of the DS. 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 11/95 
  
  
  
 
 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
FE 999049 drug substance (DS) manufacturing process has been adequately described. Main steps are: thawing 
of a working cell bank (WCB) vial, propagation of the inoculum and seeding into bioreactors, harvest with 
filtration, and purification by different chromatographic steps. The ranges of critical process parameters and the 
routine in-process controls along with acceptance criteria, including controls for microbial purity and endotoxin, 
are described for each step.  
Seeding of a bioreactor is carried out from cells derived from a single revived WCB vial. The proposed period of 
claimed system stability was supported in terms of genotypic, phenotypic or safety characteristics. 
The active substance manufacturing process is considered acceptable. 
A  summary  of  the  quality  risk  assessment  for  FE  999049  DS  manufacturing  process,  including  selection  of 
critical quality attributes (CQAs), critical process parameters (CPPs) and critical material attributes (CMAs), has 
been provided. Whilst elements of an enhanced approach have been applied during development, no claims 
have been made in terms of product and process flexibility. 
The suitability of the container closure system is supported by stability studies. Satisfactory extractable and 
leachable studies were also performed. 
Control of materials 
Sufficient information on raw materials, including resins, filters and membranes, used in the DS manufacturing 
process  has  been  submitted.  The  manufacturers  of  the  resins,  filters  and  membranes  were  also  indicated. 
Non-compendial materials were tested against vendor specifications prior to release. No animal-sourced raw 
materials  nor  animal-derived  materials/components  are  used  in  the  manufacture  of  FE  999049  DS. 
Animal-derived materials were used only during the development of the vectors.  
The  source  of  the  original  PER.C6  cell  line  was  sufficiently  described  with  details  on  the  development  and 
characterization (including extensive tumourigenicity studies). A tiered cell-banking system was established for 
commercial  production  in  accordance  with  ICH  Q5B  and  Q5D  guidelines.  The  description  of  the  strategy  for 
providing a continued supply of cells from the cell banks, including the anticipated utilization rate of the cell 
banks for production of FE 999049 DS, the expected intervals between generation of new cell bank, and the 
protocol for qualification of new cell bank are adequate. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
A comprehensive overview of critical in-process controls and critical in-process tests performed throughout the 
DS manufacturing process has been provided. Acceptable information has been provided on the control system 
in place to monitor and control the drug substance manufacturing process with regard to critical, as well as 
non-critical operational parameters and in-process tests. An IPC test plan including the parameters tested for 
each  critical  step  and  the  applied  specifications  has  been  provided.  A  detailed  summary  for  each  analytical 
procedure used for IPC testing in FE 999049 DS manufacture demonstrates that they are fit for purpose. 
Process validation 
Process validation was conducted according to the traditional approach. Taking into account not only process 
validation, but also manufacturing experience, the DS manufacturing process has been validated adequately. 
EMA/11072/2017

Manufacturing process development 
The process steps that have undergone changes from development through phase 1 and phase 2 clinical trials 
have been summarised including the batch number used. The specification throughout process development 
was  based  on  increase  of  manufacturing  experience,  process  knowledge  and  on  a  risk  assessment  of  DS 
manufacturing.  For commercial purpose, a cell-based assay will replace the in-vivo Ph. Eur. assay for potency 
for drug substance and drug product testing. Due to animal welfare considerations, and since comparability of 
the in-vivo (Steelman-Pohley assay) and the in-vitro method was demonstrated under different challenges of 
extremes of potency, oxidation levels and charge variants, the change to in-vitro assay is supported. Stability 
data under accelerated and stress conditions also showed comparable results.  
Characterisation 
The  structure  of  FE  999049  (follitropin)  was  elucidated  from  a  variety  of  biological  and  physico-chemical 
techniques to provide a comprehensive understanding of its structure and functional properties and attributes. 
Furthermore,  FE  999049  DS  was  compared  to  the  follitropin  concentrated  solution  monograph,  and  to 
CHO-derived follitropin.  
Composition, Physical Properties, Primary Structure and Higher Order Structure : The composition and primary 
structure of the FE 999049 DS mature subunits were confirmed. The higher order structure of FE 999049 DS was 
characterised. 
Glycosylation and isoform pattern: the glycosylate variants were studied as this attribute is important for FSH 
clearance and FSH activity. The 4 glycosylation sites were confirmed. 
Biological activity: The in vivo Steelman-Pohley biassay was performed according to the follitropin monograph. 
The potency is now performed according to an in vitro cell-based assay.

Stability 
Stability data under long term (36 months at -20±5°C) and accelerated conditions (6 months at 5±3°C) were 
provided for clinical and registration batches. The batch size and date of manufacture were indicated. Results of 
all batches stored at long term or under accelerated conditions comply with specification, the proposed shelf-life 
is endorsed. A forced degradation study was performed in order to identify possible degradation pathways of the 
DS and the stability-indicating methods. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the Product and Pharmaceutical Development 
The DP is presented as sterile, aqueous solution used with an injection pen to deliver three strengths 12µg, 36µg 
and 72µg. The product is administered by the subcutaneous route. The primary container for the DP is a glass 
cartridge, with a bromobutyl siliconized plunger, and a crimp cap with bi-layer septum. The nature of material of 
each primary container and the specification is provided. The choice of the container closure system has been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. The cartridge contains 33.3µg/mL 
of FE 999049 DS with Phenol, Polysorbate 20, L-methionine, Sodium sulfate decahydrate, Disodium phosphate 
dodecahydrate, Phosphoric acid concentrated(for pH adjustment), Sodium hydroxide(for pH adjustment) and 
water for injection. No novel excipients are used.  
Regarding the manufacturing process development, a traditional approach was used to develop and validate the 
FE  999049  DP  manufacture.  A  quality  risk  assessment  of  the  FE  999049  DP  manufacturing  process  was 
performed using quality by design (QbD) principles. DS CQAs affecting DP CQAs were presented. The DP CQAs 
were identified based on a sound and acceptable QTPP providing safety and efficacy.  
The DP formulation evolved through clinical development. The choice of the excipients is adequately described 
and justified. 
Compatibility of the container closure system was studied performing extractables and leachables studies. The 
integrity of the container closure system was monitored. The efficacy of the preservative was demonstrated.  
Neither dilution nor mixing is performed before administration. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The DP is manufactured by Vetter Pharma-Fertigung GmbH & Co. KG and released by Ferring GmbH.  
The DP manufacturing process consists of mixing the DS with a formulated excipient solution, followed by a 
bioburden reduction. Overall, the manufacturing process is sufficiently described. The material of vessels and 
tubing used during the DP manufacturing are indicated. The bioburden control before the final sterilisation was 
shown to be appropriately qualified in terms of preservative inactivation; in line with the harmonised chapters of 
Ph. Eur. 2.6.12/USP <61>. The maximum hold time for the bioburden reduced bulk until sterilising filtration is 
considered validated. 
The overall scheme of the control strategy for the defined critical quality attributes is satisfactory. 
Product specification  
The Finished Product Specification submitted by the Applicant is considered acceptable. 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 14/95 
  
  
  
 
Controls include: identity, content, potency, purity and impurities; appearance and description, general tests 
and microbiological tests are in compliance with Ph. Eur. requirements for DP solution to be administered by 
parenteral route. 
Regarding the impurities that may be present in addition to those present in both FE 999049 DS and DP, a 
formulation reaction product and impurities from rubber closures (plunger and crimp cap seal) were identified 
and characterised toxicologically. A safety evaluation showed no safety concerns in FE 999049 DP. The current 
specifications, including the acceptance limits, are considered as justified and acceptable. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis 
Batch results were presented and tested against the specifications valid at that time.  
Stability of the product 
Updated stability data were provided to support the 3-year shelf-life when stored at 5±3°C. In addition, in use 
stability  data  has  been  provided  in  order  to  support  the  proposed  ambulatory  use  of  the  product  within  its 
declared shelf life. . The in-use stability studies support the SmPC statement in Section 6.4: “REKOVELLE may 
be removed from the refrigerator, without being refrigerated again, and stored at or below 25°C for up to 3 
months including the period after first use”. 
The  dosing  accuracy  has  been  adequately  demonstrated.  A  photostability  study  demonstrated  the  DP  in 
cartridge to be stable when protected by the pen and by the secondary packaging. 
A freeze-thaw study was performed and showed that the product cannot be frozen. This is mentioned in the 
product information. 
Regional information 
The  delivery  system  consists  of  an  injection  pen,  a  cartridge  and  an  injection  needle.  A  description  of  the 
injection system was provided with drawings of the injection pen, the injection pen assembled and unassembled 
with cartridge and needle. An EC certificate from an EU Notified body and an EC declaration of conformity from 
the manufacturer has been provided for the injection pen. The pen is a re-usable non sterile device designed to 
assist with the delivery of doses of FE 999049 DP from the cartridge. It is declared compliant with ISO 11608-1 
“Needle-based  injection  systems  for  medical  use  -  Requirements  and  test  methods.  Needle-based  injection 
systems”, which includes dose accuracy, reproducibility and plunger rod force. The pen has been demonstrated 
suitable for its intended function by the intended users. Regarding the injection needles (Omnican® fine 29G x 
12 mm or Clickfine 29G x 12 mm pen needles), a certificate of compliance to Council Directive 93/42/EEC on 
medical devices was provided. The injection needles comply with ISO 11608-2 “Needle-based injection systems 
for  medical  use  -  Requirements  and  test  methods”.  A  dose  calculator  application,  intended  for  Health  Care 
Professionals to calculate the daily dose of FE 999049 based on body weight and the anti-Müllerian hormone 
(AMH) value, is presented. In addition, a copy of the EC declaration of conformity was submitted in the dossier 
for the dose calculator application. 
EMA/11072/2017

The dosing schedule for this product is directed by the use of Roche’s Elecsys anti-Müllerian hormone diagnostic 
assay. The assay is itself a CE certified in vitro diagnostic medical device. The risk of OHSS has been 
acknowledged for patients possibly receiving a higher dose than required in the first treatment cycle. Reference 
to the RMP for preventative measures to reduce the risk of OHSS in high responders is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
The viral safety of Rekovelle is well addressed. No raw materials of animal origin were used for the establishment 
of the MCB, both WCBs and in the manufacture of FE 999049 DS. Animal-derived materials were used only 
during the development of the vectors and PER.C6 cell line and as a medium supplement prior to the generation 
of the master cell bank (MCB). There is a negligible risk in relation to TSE. The parental cells, MCB, WCB and 
PPCB cells were extensively assayed for adventitious agents. No viral particles were observed. The data 
demonstrate that the manufacturing process contains two effective orthogonal steps for removal/inactivation of 
each of the four non-specific model viruses that represent a wide range of structural and physico-chemical 
properties. Global reduction factors were satisfactory. Virus validation studies have been performed to meet the 
CPMP/BWP/268/95 guideline. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
No Major Objections were raised during the procedure. However, a number of Other Concerns were initially 
identified, which have all been adequately addressed during the evaluation process as described within the 
Quality aspects. During the evaluation, further substantiation of comparability between in-vivo and in-vitro 
assay was requested and adequately addressed. In reference to the “companion” diagnostic and a dose 
calculating application, the CHMP emphasised the need of the Applicant to resolve the risks associated with the 
individualised dosing schedule, the very small stratified dose increments based on the measurement of the 
anti-Müllerian hormone levels (which are determined using the Roche Elecsys anti-Müllerian hormone diagnostic 
kit) and the consistency and reproducibility of the use of this diagnostic kit to guide dosing between different 
clinics. In light of the clinical relevance (posology/dosing) of these aspects, input from the clinical experts was 
sought. As detailed in the Quality Aspects section, these points were adequately addressed by the applicant; 
additionally the RMP includes preventative measures to reduce the risk of OHSS in high responders. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented and is satisfactory. The batch data results indicate consistency and uniformity of important product 
quality characteristics through shelf life, and these in turn substantiate a satisfactory and uniform performance 
in clinical use. 
The active substance and the finished product have been appropriately characterised and satisfactory 
documentation has been provided. The description of the manufacturing process and the manufacturing 
development is adequate. The results indicate that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the active 
substance and finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. 
In conclusion, based on the review of the quality data provided, the marketing authorisation application for 
REKOVELLE is approvable from the quality point of view.

2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommends one point for investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
FE999049 (follitropin delta) is a recombinant human follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), expressed in a host cell 
line of human origin (PER.C6®), distinguishing it from others which are produced on Chinese Hamster Ovary 
(CHO). The amino acid sequence of FE999049 is identical to purified FSH and to that of existing CHO derived 
recombinant FSH products. Conversely to existing CHO derived recombinant FSH products, FE999049 contains 
both α2,3 and α2,6 sialylation patterns, which reproduce the glycosylation pattern of the human glycoprotein.  
No studies on the primary pharmacology were included in the program per se. As clinical data have shown that 
PK and PD of clinical batches of FE999049 were not comparable to Gonal-F® in humans, the Applicant proposed, 
following scientific advice, to generate comparative in vitro PD data based on a reporter gene assay with stable 
expressed human FSH receptor in e.g. HEK-293 cells or with the well-known rat granulosa cell aromatase assay 
to strengthen the non-clinical pharmacology section. Therefore, several comparative (Gonal-F® versus 
FE999049) in vitro studies were conducted by the Applicant for this MAA to confirm affinity of FE999049 for the 
receptor and its subsequent activation.  
With regards to the binding assay of FE999049 to the human FSH receptor, the Applicant concluded that the 
affinity of FE999049 ligand to its receptor has been demonstrated, since saturation of its receptor was reached 
with a Kd value of 0.2 nM. Next, in a study investigating the functional activation of FSH receptors on human 
granulosa cells by FE999049, secretion of progesterone and inhibin A demonstrated a significant dose response 
in relation of the FSH concentration as did the gene expression of 3ß-HSD and inhibin A. No statistically 
significant difference between FE999049 and Gonal-F® was observed for any of the measured parameters.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
With regards to the secondary pharmacology aspects, no secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been 
performed. Secondary pharmacology effects of FE999049 are not anticipated, since FSH receptors are mainly 
found in gonads and uterus. In addition, taking into account the clinical experience, the absence of secondary 
pharmacodynamic studies was considered acceptable.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
Regarding the safety pharmacology, a hERG test has been performed in stably transfected HEK293 cells. The 
formulation analysis determined the concentration of FE999049 to be 12% of the nominal concentration of 50 
IU/mL in the perfusion solution samples taken from the recording chamber. The Applicant explained that the low 
recoveries of FE999049 in the perfusion solution samples could be a consequence of test substance instability in 
hERG bath solution. This was alleviated by the fact that an in vivo study was performed in telemetered 
Cynomolgus primates. It is noticed, in the study performed in conscious telemetered Cynomolgus primates, that 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 17/95 
  
  
  
the values of concentrations of FE999049 in serum samples appeared very disparate (from 164 mIU/ml to 2590 
mIU/ml in males at Day 5, and from 355 to 1570 mIU/ml in females at Day 12). However, the number of animals 
involved in the study is low, which may explain this variability. Regarding the studies conducted with FE999049 
on respiratory parameters and central nervous system, no effects have been reported. The no observed adverse 
effect level (NOAEL) was the high dose/high concentration (52.2 μg/kg) in all the in vivo studies. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been performed. Based on the clinical experience with 
already marketed rhFSH, no interactions are expected. Hence, no further studies were considered needed. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Since the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of FSH is well known and described in the literature, no complex 
ADME studies have been performed, which was accepted. Exposure data/toxicokinetic (TK) parameters were 
determined from satellite animals included in general toxicology studies with rats and monkeys, dosed via the 
subcutaneous (s.c) route of administration.  
Regarding analytical methods, measurements of rhFSH concentrations in rat and monkey serum were 
performed according to an ELISA method, using a validated commercially available enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assay, manufactured by Alpco Diagnostics USA.  
In general, exposure to FE999049 was evident for at least 24 hours in both rats and monkeys evincing that 
animals subjected to toxicokinetic analyses were continuously exposed to the drug product. The half-life in rats 
was 5.9-9.7 hours and 18-26 hours in monkeys. Minor accumulation was reported in rats following up to 28 days 
repeated dosing, as opposed to a marked accumulation in monkeys which could be related to the increase in 
half-life in this species.  
Gender-specific TK differences were apparent in the MTD monkey study (study # 1475/099; n=1/sex). 
However, it can be assumed that the observed differences were incidental and/or due to inter-individual 
variation and low numbers of animals.  
Concerning the absorption aspects, the unique pharmacokinetic study has been performed in rats via the 
intravenous route. The pertinence of the route of administration was raised, as the intended therapeutic route 
is the subcutaneous one. However, the Applicant argued that toxicokinetics parameters of FE999049 in rats and 
monkeys were comparable to other rhFSH. The Applicant provided a review of t1/2 of different commercialized 
rhFSH (with data extracted from the literature). Nevertheless, the comparison was not possible, since different 
dosages, species and routes of administration (IV, IM, SC) were used in animals.  
About the distribution aspects, according to ICHS6, classical biotransformation studies are not needed for 
biotechnology recombinant products. Therefore, no specific distribution, metabolism and excretion studies have 
been conducted with FE999049. Actual literature indicates that both endogenous and exogenous FSH are 
excreted via the kidneys and via the biliary pathway. Gonadotropins are eliminated from the blood stream as 
intact molecules and as α- or β-subunits via the renal pathway as well as via liver metabolism (i.e. through 
capture by the asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGPR) in the liver). The asialoglycoprotein receptor (ASGP-R) is a 
hepatic receptor that mediates the rapid clearance of glycoproteins containing terminal galactose, GalNac or 
Siaα2,6 GalNac residues from the circulation, playing thus a prominent role as determinant of the elimination 
capacity of gonadotropins.  
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 18/95 
  
  
  
Two further non-GLP experimental studies were conducted in rodents to address the differences in glycosylation 
profiles between FE999049 (produced in human derived cells PER.C6 cells) and Gonal-F® (a recombinant FSH 
expressed in CHO cells) and the potential impact on pharmacokinetic behaviour, since a difference in elimination 
between Gonal-F® and FE999049 was observed in clinical trials.  
These studies clearly showed the implication and the important role of the ASGP hepatic receptor for the hepatic 
elimination of FE999049 in rodents, while it seems to not intervene in the metabolic elimination of Gonal-f®. 
This is explained by the fact that FE999049 bears sialic acid linkage and N-acetylgalactosamine in position α2,6, 
which are carbohydrates residues identified as targets for the ASGP Receptor, whereas Gonal-f® does not.  
In conclusion, the Applicant explained that a difference in metabolic elimination in the two rodent species 
dependent on the specific cellular origin of human rFSH could be the reason for the differences in human 
pharmacokinetics. 
It was noticed that both mechanistic and experimental studies were conducted only in male adult animals, and 
not in females. The CHMP assumed that the aim of these studies, only performed in males, was to eliminate a 
possible bias, as up and down regulation of ASGP-Receptor expression in liver of female rats seemed to be 
correlated to the female hormonal status, particularly the progesterone plasma levels. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicity programme comprised single dose studies in mice and rats using both the intravenous and 
subcutaneous route of administration. All other studies were conducted by the subcutaneous route to support 
the anticipated clinical route of administration and included: repeated dose toxicity studies for 4 weeks duration 
with 4 weeks reversibility period off dose in rats and Cynomolgus monkeys, and a fertility and early embryonic 
development study in female rats. These main studies were preceded by dose range finding studies in rats and 
a maximum tolerable dose study in monkeys. An additional study on the formation of neutralising antibodies 
was performed in rats.  
Based on the nature of the test compound and the indication, the toxicity programme did not contain the 
following studies: repeated dose toxicity studies beyond 4 weeks duration, mutagenicity studies, carcinogenicity 
studies and reproduction studies SII and SIII. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
Single dose toxicity 
Four single dose toxicity studies with FE999049 were conducted in mice and rats, via the intravenous and 
subcutaneous routes of administration. The NOAEL was considered by the Applicant to be 290 μg/kg for all 
studies (725-fold the anticipated maximum human dose). 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Two pivotal repeated dose toxicity studies with FE999049 were performed in rats and Cynomolgus monkeys, via 
the subcutaneous route of administration. A 2-week dose range finding (DRF) study in rats and a maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) study in Cynomolgus monkeys preceded the two pivotal studies.  
There were no adverse, off-target effects, and all effects were considered direct or indirect pharmacological FSH 
effects of FE999049 in both species.  
Following daily subcutaneous administration of FE999049 for 4 weeks at dose levels up to 1000 IU/kg/day, no 
major toxic effects have been observed in rats and monkeys. However, FE999049 produced macroscopic 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 19/95 
  
  
  
changes in ovaries and oviducts, and microscopic changes in ovaries, vagina, cervix, uterus and mammary 
tissue of females. The Applicant argued these changes to be related to the hormonal influences and 
perturbations consistent with the pharmacological action of FE999049.  
During the the pivotal repeated dose toxicity performed in rats (ref: ADR 0060), very low estradiol 
concentrations were observed in female rats, especially in high dose treated females, and were unexpected. 
However, this high dose phenomenon can be related to down regulation and/or desensitization of the 
posttranslational FSH receptor pathway, resulting in a bell-shaped dose response curves and potentially a 
biased behavior of the receptor activation. No formal toxicokinetic assessment was performed in the context of 
this pivotal rat study, as only “trough” values were determined, limiting the interpretation of the results of this 
study. The NOAEL was considered to be the high dose of 52.2 μg/kg/day, corresponding to 130-fold of the 
anticipated human dose. In the same study, anti-FE999049 antibodies were not detected in any rat of any group 
using the analytical method described in the protocol. As an explanation, the Applicant assumes that the failure 
to detect antibodies to be due to a species specific deficiency of the analytical assay used for detection, involving 
a low affinity of protein G to rat immunoglobulin. 
In the pivotal 4 week subcutaneous toxicity study performed in Cynomolgus monkeys (ref: 1475-101), 
histopathological findings showed the presence of thymic cysts in male animals from the three treated groups 
(absent in the controls), which were still present at the end of the recovery period. In addition, in females, an 
atrophy of the thymus is noticed in all treated groups whereas absent in controls, which persists at the end of the 
recovery period. Globally, the Applicant justified that the thymic observations of cysts in males and atrophy in 
females reflect normal variations in the spontaneous (background) histopathological findings of Cynomolgus 
monkeys and are not considered treatment related and consequently of negligible clinical relevance for humans. 
More specifically, as regards atrophic changes observed in the thymus of females dosed animals, the Applicant 
specified that atrophic changes in the thymus are usually the result of either an age-related involution of the 
organ or a stress-induced event. The CHMP agreed with this, as bibliographical data supported this justification. 
As concerns the thymic cysts that were observed in male animals at the end of the dosing phase as well as at the 
end of the recovery period, the Applicant provided historical data on background thymic findings in Cynomolgus 
macaques. Considering the mean incidence range of 4-60% of thymic involution in the historical data provided 
by the Applicant, the “atrophy and cysts” reported during the course of the study 1475-101 could be considered 
as histological description of thymic involution, and not related to treatment with FE 999049. The issue was 
considered solved. In terms of toxicokinetics, accumulation was observed in all treated animals after 28 days of 
repeated dosing, with a high degree of inter-animal variability. Safety margin between animal exposure at the 
NOAEL and human exposure was 187, based on AUC values.  
Genotoxicity 
No  genotoxicity  studies  have  been  conducted,  since  FE999049  has  a  primary  structure  identical  with  the 
endogenous protein hormone.  
Carcinogenicity 
No genotoxicity studies have been conducted, since FE999049 has a primary structure identical with the 
endogenous protein hormone. 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 20/95 
  
  
  
Reproduction Toxicity 
The rationale for conducting a female fertility and early embryonic development study was unusual, considering 
the mode of action of FE999049 on gonads and reproductive cycle. Results showed an evidence of treatment 
related effects in female rats for both mid and high dose of FE999049, as female fertility was clearly reduced. As 
the intended clinical indication of FE999049 is dedicated to ovarian stimulation for the development of multiple 
follicles, these effects on fertility didn’t raise any concerns. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Regarding the overall toxicokinetic aspects, it can be concluded that although the pivotal study conducted in rats 
did not permit to determine systemic animal exposure, however data obtained in the course of other repeated 
toxicity studies (DRF and pivotal study in monkeys) exhibited sufficient safety margins.  
Local Tolerance  
One study has been performed in female rabbits to assess the local tolerance of five different formulations of 
FE999049. It was unclear what the rationale for conducting a separate study to evaluate local tolerance was. The 
design of the study did not envisage repeated injections, so as to mimic exactly the foreseen therapeutic 
administration scheme. However, the results of this study in rabbits were in line with those obtained in the 
repeat-dose toxicity studies performed in monkeys, showing minimal to slight focal or multifocal perivascular 
inflammation in the subcutis of one or more injection sites. The CHMP agreed that this perivascular inflammation 
at the injection sites was considered completely reversible in the recovery animals.  
Other toxicity studies 
As regards the antigenicity, unexpectedly, no anti-FE999049 antibodies were detected in any rat toxicity 
studies. However, anti-FE999049 antibodies were detected in Cynomolgus males and females monkeys during 
both non-pivotal and pivotal studies. The males seemed to mount a stronger antibody formation response than 
females. Results were interpreted carefully, because it was stated that study samples were analyzed beyond the 
validated stability period (storage up to 4 months prior to analysis). Following the unsuccessful results of 
antibody detection studies obtained during the rat toxicity studies, one additional alternative experimental 
non-GLP study has been realized in order to evaluate the potential immunogenicity of FE999049 after repeated 
subcutaneous administrations in female rats. This study confirmed, contrary to precedent results, that 
FE999049 was well immunogenic in almost all treated rats after 2-4 weeks of treatment, and indicated that 
anti-FE999049 antibodies produced were neutralising.  
The great variability in some of the parameters, including some exposure data, observed in the course of the 
toxicity studies might be explained by production of such neutralising anti-drug antibodies leading to low or no 
exposure to FE 999049 in some animals. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No environmental risk assessment studies have been provided by the Applicant. The Applicant justified in ERA 
document that as the active substance FE999049 is a protein and that due to its nature it is unlikely to result in 
a significant risk to the environment.  
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 21/95 
  
  
  
 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The nonclinical development program was designed as a limited program, to evaluate the pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetic, and toxicology of follitropin delta in support of MAA.  
Regarding the GLP aspects, a review of the conformity to the GLP principles has been realized for most of the 
studies included in the safety pharmacology and toxicology program.   
Regarding primary pharmacodynamics, in vitro studies conducted by the Applicant demonstrated that FE999049 
and Gonal-F (approved rhFSH product) were similar with respect to receptor binding, activation of luteinised 
granulosa cells and activation of the human receptor in HEK 293 cells.  
Regarding the safety pharmacology studies conducted with FE999049, apart from low recoveries of FE999049 
obtained during the hERG test, there was no cardiovascular effect in vitro and neither in telemetered 
Cynomolgus monkeys. Also, no effect was reported in studies conducted with FE999049 on respiratory 
parameters and central nervous system.  
Secondary pharmacology effects of FE999049 were not anticipated, since FSH receptors were restricted to the 
gonads and the uterus. Consequently, no secondary pharmacodynamic studies were performed.  
As gonadotropins have been used in assisted reproduction technology (ART) for decades and are well described, 
no pharmacodynamics drug interaction studies have been performed which was considered acceptable.  
Since the pharmacokinetics and metabolism of FSH is well known and described in the literature, no complex 
ADME studies have been performed which was considered acceptable. Exposure data/toxicokinetic (TK) 
parameters were determined from satellite animals included in general toxicology studies with rats and 
monkeys dosed via the subcutaneous (s.c) route of administration.  
Gender-specific TK differences were apparent in the MTD monkey study (study # 1475/099; n=1/sex). 
However, it was agreed that the observed differences were most probable incidental and/or due to 
inter-individual variation and low numbers of animals.  
One unique pharmacokinetic study was conducted in female rats by i.v. route, and showed a rapid elimination 
for FE999049 (t 1/2 = 9,4 hours).  
From the toxicity point of view, repeated dose toxicity studies served to indicate that the expected risk 
associated with clinical use of FE999049 comes from the pharmacological (exaggerated) effect, which could be 
associated with hormonal over-dose. Indeed, following daily subcutaneous administration of FE999049 for 4 
weeks at dose levels up to 1000 IU/kg/day, no major toxic effects have been observed in rats and monkeys. The 
main target was the female reproductive system and mammary tissues. FE999049 produced macroscopic 
changes in ovaries and oviducts, and microscopic changes in ovaries, vagina, cervix, uterus and mammary 
tissue of females. These changes are probably related to the hormonal influences and perturbations consistent 
with the pharmacological action of FE999049. At the end of the treatment-free period, there were no 
histopathological findings in the uterus, cervix and vagina of the recovery female rats. Only macroscopic and 
microscopic changes in the ovaries were still found in female rats which had been given the high dose of 1000 
IU/kg/day of FE999049, which represents roughly 130 folds the therapeutic dose.  
In the pivotal studies, two findings deserved further explanations. First, in the rat study, oestradiol assays were 
abnormally low and inconclusive in treated female rats, as they were not consistent with the expected 
pharmacological action of rhFSH. However, this high dose phenomenon could be related to down regulation 
and/or desensitization of the posttranslational FSH receptor pathway, resulting in a bell-shaped dose response 
curves and potentially a biased behavior of the receptor activation.  
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 22/95 
  
  
  
Secondly, in the monkey study, histopathological findings showed the presence of thymic cysts in male animals 
from the three treated groups (absent in the controls), still present at the end of the recovery period. In 
addition, in females, an atrophy of the thymus was noticed in all treated groups whereas absent in controls, 
which persisted at the end of the recovery period. Globally, the Applicant justified that the thymic observations 
of cysts in males and atrophy in females reflect normal variations in the spontaneous (background) 
histopathological findings of Cynomolgus monkeys and therefore they were not considered treatment related 
and consequently of negligible clinical relevance for humans. More specifically, as regards atrophic changes 
observed in the thymus of females dosed animals, the Applicant specified that atrophic changes in the thymus 
were usually the result of either an age-related involution of the organ or a stress-induced event. The CHMP 
agreed with this, as bibliographical data supported this justification. As concerns the thymic cysts that were 
observed in male animals at the end of the dosing phase as well as at the end of the recovery period, the 
Applicant provided historical data on background thymic findings in Cynomolgus macaques. Considering the 
mean incidence range of 4-60% of thymic involution in the historical data provided by the Applicant, the 
“atrophy and cysts” reported during the course of the study 1475-101 could be considered as histological 
description of thymic involution, and not related to treatment with FE 999049. This was agreed with the CHMP.   
Regarding the overall toxicokinetic aspects, data obtained in the course of repeated toxicity studies (DRF and 
pivotal study in monkeys) exhibited sufficient safety margins.  
During the fertility and early embryonic development study conducted in rats, fertility of female rats was 
affected. As FE999049 is indicated in women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies such as IVF and 
ICSI, no concerns were raised regarding this fact. Concerning the early embryonic development study, the 
information was added in the SmPC that FE999049 is contraindicated in pregnant and lactating women.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considers that the nonclinical program was limited but well addressed.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The development program proposed by the applicant was submitted as a stand-alone application. In contrast to 
existing rFSH products (Gonal-F is here taken as reference comparator), follitropin delta strength of the drug 
product is labelled in micrograms (μg) but not in international units (IU) and so is the recommended dosing 
regimen. The posology for follitropin delta (labelled in μg) is to be individualized for each patient, and 
determined on the basis of patient’s body weight and serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) concentration, which 
is considered by the Applicant as a biomarker of ovarian response to gonadotropins. However, the duration of 
treatment is similar to the one recommended for Gonal-F. Follitropin delta drug product is designed for 
subcutaneous administration. Three strengths are intended for marketing, containing the same protein 
concentration of 33.3 μg/mL: 12, 36 and 72 micrograms in respectively 0.36, 1.08 and 2.16 mL. 
To support this application, four PK phase 1 trials in healthy female volunteers, one dose-response phase 2 
(Study 000009) and one phase 3 in IVF/ICSI patients were conducted. The phase 1 program investigated the 
single-dose PK profile of follitropin delta across a wide dose range in Caucasians (CS01), in Japanese (CS03), the 
absolute bioavailability study (000020), as well as the multiple-dose PK and PD profiles in comparison to 
GONAL-F (CS02).

GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
•  Tabular overview of clinical studies 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The ADME of FSH is well known and well described in the literature. The amino acid sequence of follitropin delta 
is identical to that of endogenous human FSH and existing CHO derived rFSH products. However, in contrast to 
these products, follitropin delta is the first rFSH expressed from a host cell line of human origin (PER.C6®). It 
appears that structural differences in glycosylation exist and influence both the PK (specifically on elimination) 
and PD profiles. 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 24/95 
  
  
  
 
Generally, the bio-analytical methods used for the determination of FSH levels in human serum and urine, AMH 
levels in serum and anti-FSH antibodies appeared adequate and comply with acceptance criteria regarding 
selectivity, sensitivity, accuracy and precision. Analytical validation reports were provided with satisfactory 
results. Short-term and long-term stability of the analytes in the biological matrix was tested and shown to be 
satisfactory. Thus, concentration data of FSH in serum and urine, serum AMH levels could be considered as valid. 
Besides, as distinct methods were used for quantification of FSH levels in serum for phase 1 studies and further 
in phase 2 and 3 trials, cross validation data were requested to show that both methods (ANA-DCB-0064 method 
versus Immulite 2500 and Beckman Dxi 800 commercial kits) resulted in comparable FSH concentrations across 
the clinical program development. The applicant provided adequate explanations with regard to the lack of such 
data. Indeed, FSH measurements from phase 2 (obtained with commercial kits) were not used for any pivotal 
decision making, such the determination of the dosing regimen of FE 999049. Moreover, the PK model 
developed in phase 2 (trial 000009) for the purpose of predicting exposure (AUC estimates were derived from 
CL/F) was shown to be not to be particularly sensitive to the fixed parameters values (V/F, ka and tlag) from 
phase 1 trial (CS01). In conclusion, it was agreed that cross-validation data between the formal PK assay and 
the central lab assays could be waived.  
Standard methods (NCA) and population (NLME) were used for PK data analysis. General methods have been 
applied and considered acceptable for statistical analyses. 
The formulation intended for marketing is identical to the formulation used in the phase 3 trials. The formulation 
of drug product follitropin delta has slightly changed from initial PK phase 1 trials comparatively to that intended 
for commercial use (the same used in both phase 2 and 3 studies). However, these changes are not deemed to 
have any impact on the PKs of follitropin delta. The lack of bioequivalence study could be considered acceptable. 
Absorption  
Based on the absolute BA study 000020, the mean absolute BA of follitropin delta given SC was determined to 
be 64%, very similar to that for Gonal-F (60.4%). Given the route of administration (SC), this value represents 
the minimum of absorbed fraction of follitropin delta. Follitropin delta was absorbed slowly after both single 
(CS01, CS03, 000020) and multiple (CS02) subcutaneous (SC) administration to healthy female subjects, with 
the median Tmax ranging from 10 to 24 hours. In study 000020, the T1/2 of follitropin delta after SC 
administration was found to be considerably longer than after IV administration (38 versus 24 hours) indicating 
that the absorption rate is the rate-limiting step for elimination, so-called ‘flip-flop’ kinetics. According to the 
applicant, the same observation has been published for Gonal-F, and in a thorough population PK analysis 
comparing a recombinant FSH and a urinary derived FSH after single SC and intramuscular (IM) administrations 
where it was demonstrated that the absorption rate was on average slower than the elimination rate for both 
preparations. 
Distribution 
Following SC administration of follitropin delta in both healthy women and patients, mean apparent volume of 
distribution (Vz/F) was approximately 25 L. This value was also confirmed by population PK analysis. After IV 
administration, mean Vss was about 9L (very similar to what observed for Gonal-F), indicating that follitropin 
delta is mainly confined in vascular compartment. Overall, the distribution characteristics of follitropin delta 
seems to be similar to what has been reported for other recombinant FSH preparations. 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 25/95 
  
  
  
Elimination 
No formal investigations on metabolism and excretory pathway of follitropin delta have been conducted. The 
lack of such investigations could be acceptable since metabolism and elimination are well-known. Follitropin 
delta is expected to be metabolized like other FSH preparations, predominantly in the kidneys, but also in the 
liver. Both endogenous and exogenous FSH is excreted via the kidneys and via the biliary nonspecific 
catabolism. 
The apparent clearance (CL/F) following SC administration was similar across all trials in healthy and patient’s 
and was around 0.5 L/h which corresponds well with the clearance after IV administration (0.3 L/h) and the 
absolute BA (64%) of follitropin delta. 
Comparison of the clearance between follitropin delta and Gonal-F over trials (single SC and IV administrations) 
consistently demonstrated a significant lower clearance with follitropin delta than that of Gonal-F, resulting in a 
higher exposure (1.4 to to 1.7-fold higher for Cmax and AUC) when dosed at the same bioactivity. Accordingly, 
T1/2 of follitropin delta was longer than Gonal-F across studies: the T1/2 of follitropin delta was 28 hours 
compared to 18 hours for Gonal-F. This could be expected since glycosylation profile of follitropin delta is 
significantly different than in CHO-derived rFSH and is characterized by higher proportion of tetra-antennary 
structures and higher overall sialic acid content. Glycosylation is known to be associated with decreased 
metabolic clearance. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Based on PK data from dose-escalation trial in healthy female volunteers (study CS01) and phase 2 
dose-response study 00009 in IVF/ICSI women, exposure of FE 999049 appears to exhibit linear behavior 
across therapeutic dose range up to 24 μg after SC single and multiple-dose administration  (24 μg being the 
maximum dose in the proposed posology for repeated cycles). Dose proportionality of PKs follitropin delta was 
confirmed by population PK analyses. 
In study CS02, following repeated SC QD dosing of FE 999049 over 7 days, the serum FSH concentration 
reached a steady state level after 6-7 days. Follitropin delta accumulated as expected with mean ratio of 2.5 to 
3, which is consistent with T1/2. In comparison to Gonal-F, the observed time to steady state was longer than 
claimed for Gonal-F (within 3-4 days) but in line with the longer half-life observed for follitropin delta. 
After SC multiple doses, there is a confirmation of lower clearance and overexposure with follitropin delta 
compared to Gonal-F. Indeed, when dosed at the same bioactivity, the apparent clearance, CL/F, was 1.6-fold 
higher with Gonal-F (0.92 versus 0.56 L/h) and consequently AUCt and Cmax with follitropin delta were 1.63 and 
1.60-fold the corresponding value with Gonal-F, with the 90% ratio CI being [1.40;1.90] and [1.38; 1.86], 
respectively. 
No estimation of intra-individual variability of follitropin delta could be made. 
Across formal PK studies, inter-individual variability for follitropin delta was generally moderate, and ranged 
from 12 to 33% for AUC and from 12 to 37% for Cmax. This estimation was confirmed by population analysis in 
which inter-subject variability in IVF/ICSI patients was found to be 22 and 30% for respectively CL/F and V/F. 
Population PK analyses 
Two population PK analyses for serum FSH concentrations were performed based respectively on data from trial 
CS01 (rich data from healthy females) and phase II dose-response trial 000009 (sparse data in 265 IVF/ICSI 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 26/95 
  
  
  
patients). To completely endorse the results of the POPPK models in CS01 and 000009, a number of concerns 
have been raised and further development of these models was required. Moreover, population models were not 
initially reported to the standards normally required as per EMA Guideline on reporting the results of population 
pharmacokinetics (CHMP/EWP/185990/06). For both models, the applicant has subsequently presented a much 
improved reporting of the POPPK including the requested tables and plots. In general, the models were 
considered acceptable in terms of their development and the diagnostics supplied.  
Using population PK model developed in study 000009, a PK/PD modelling was performed to characterise the 
dose-response relationship of FE 999049 and to establish an optimal individualised FE 999049 dosing regimen 
based on serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) and body weight. A number of concerns were addressed with 
regard to the PK/PD and exposure response models. The applicant provided the requested data. For instance, a 
number of different dose exposure responses models were investigated and showed the sigmoidal Emax with a 
slope parameter, to give the best fit. The updated POPPK model was re-run with the effects of age, race and 
renal function to determine exposure for use in the DER modelling, showing similar estimated PD endpoints to 
those previously calculated. The applicant has also clarified that the daily dose by AMH concentration was 
calculated using PK-PD modelling which showed that the number of oocytes retrieved is influenced by AMH 
concentration and weight. The number of oocytes retrieved increased with weight-adjusted dose and also with 
AMH level. The impact of body weight appeared to be more relevant at lower doses of FE999049 and small 
increases in FE999049 had a direct correlation to the number of oocytes retrieved. 
Special populations 
No formal investigations in subjects with impaired renal function have been performed. The applicant considered 
that renal excretion of intact FE 999049 did not play a major role in the elimination as only 9% of the dose of FE 
999049 was excreted unchanged in the urine. The dependence of FE 999049 exposure on glomerular filtration 
rate (eGFR) was evaluated in both phase II and phase III trials. Based on provided PK data (effect of eGFR rate 
on ratio exposure FE 999049), it could be agreed that mild renal impairment does not have a marked effect on 
the systemic exposure to FE 999049. However, no data or very few are available for respectively severe and 
moderate renal impaired patients. Therefore no conclusions can be drawn on the recommended use in these 
subgroups. The warnings regarding the fact that FE 999049 has not been studied in moderate and severe renal 
impaired patients was included in section 4.4 of SmPC.  
No formal investigations in subjects with impaired hepatic function have been performed. The applicant was 
asked to further discuss the impact of hepatic impairment of the PKs of FE 999049 and modality of use in this 
subgroup. For the purpose, the Applicant provide data (effects of AST/ALT and bilirubin markers on ratio 
exposure of FE999049) from phase II trial 000009 (using the updated PK model) and phase III trial 000004 
(1326 subjects). In these analyses patients were not graded according to the Child-Plough classification. Thus, 
such investigations could not be formally conclusive regarding a potential impact of hepatic impairment on PKs 
of FE999049. However, based on the provided data, the elevated levels of hepatic function markers (AST/ALT 
and bilirubin) appears to not have a marked effect on the systemic exposure to FE 999049. Overall, the studied 
population seems to include mainly patients with normal hepatic function and only few mild hepatic impaired 
patients. No data are available for moderate and severe hepatic impaired patients. Therefore, even it could be 
agreed that mild hepatic impairment did not significantly affect exposure of FE999049, no conclusions could be 
made regarding moderate and severe hepatic impaired subgroups. The warnings regarding the fact that FE 
999049 has not been studied in moderate and severe hepatic impaired patients was added to section 4.4 of 
SmPC. 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 27/95 
  
  
  
Comparisons between Japanese and Caucasian women following SC administration of 450 IU follitropin delta 
demonstrated very similar exposure by means of AUC and Cmax. 
The effect of body weight on CL/F and V/F of follitropin delta was found to be statistically significant in the 
population PK analyses performed in both healthy females and IVF/ICS patients. Findings from power models 
indicated an approximately proportional increase in the estimate of CL/F and V/F (decrease in systemic exposure 
of follitropin delta) with increasing BW (p<0.0001). Accordingly, it was agreed that body weight should be 
included in the follitropin delta dosing algorithm. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No in vitro or in vivo investigations of drug-drug interactions have been performed and no pharmacokinetic 
interactions have been observed in the clinical development program. This information is clearly mentioned in 
the section 4.5 of the SmPC, by the following sentence: “Clinically significant interactions with other medicinal 
products have neither been reported during follitropin delta therapy, nor are expected”. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Follitropin delta is a recombinant human FSH. The amino acid sequences of the two FSH subunits in follitropin 
delta are identical to the endogenous human FSH sequences. Follitropin delta is demonstrated to have specific 
affinity for and functional activity at the human FSH receptor which in women is only expressed in the granulosa 
cells of the ovary. The most important effect resulting from parenteral administration of FSH is the development 
of multiple mature follicles.  
Primary pharmacology 
Pharmacodynamics  following  repeated  SC  administrations  of  follitropin  delta  was  investigated  in  two  trials: 
CS02 and 000009. 
Study CS02 (phase 1 multiple dose PK/PD study) 
Objectives 
The primary objectives of the study were to assess the safety and tolerability of follitropin delta given as multiple 
subcutaneous doses of 225 IU in healthy women. The secondary objectives were to investigate the 
pharmacokinetic profile and the pharmacodynamics of follitropin delta, compared to another recombinant FSH 
(follitropin alfa, Gonal-F). 
Design 
This was a double-blind, randomised, active control, parallel group phase 1 study. Follitropin delta and Gonal-F 
were given for 7 days to healthy women. 49 women were included, 24 of which were treated with follitropin delta 
and 25 with GONAL-F. The trial was conducted in one clinical center in Miami (USA). 
Treatments 
The subjects were randomised to receive a daily dose of 225 IU of follitropin delta or 225 IU of Gonal-F 
subcutaneously for 7 days. The subjects also received two administrations of a 1-month depot formulation of 
LUPRON DEPOT (GnRH agonist) to down-regulate endogenous release of FSH during the study.  
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 28/95 
  
  
  
Population 
Healthy women, 21-39 years of age and with a BMI of 18-29 kg/m2, with a normal menstrual cycle, using 
combined monophasic oral contraceptives for the last 3 months prior to the run-in period, could be included in 
this study. 
Pharmacodynamics endpoints 
Pharmacodynamics assessments for the investigation of any PK/PD relationship included serum oestradiol, 
serum inhibin-B, serum LH, serum progesterone, and the number and size of follicles measured by transvaginal 
ultrasound. 
Results 
Inhibin-B 
The inhibin-B concentration increased subsequent to the increase in FSH plasma concentration, although with a 
delay in the onset phase. The mean plasma concentration of inhibin-B with follitropin delta increased 90-fold to 
a maximum mean of approx. 2 ng/mL which was reached on Day 7 and maintained over the next two days, after 
which it declined. GONAL-F induced an inhibin-B time-course of similar general appearance but at lower 
concentrations, the maximum mean concentration being approx. 1.2 ng/mL, a 47-fold increase from baseline, 
reached on Day 8 (Figure 3).  
Figure 3 
Time-course of inhibin-B concentration 
Oestradiol 
The oestradiol concentration increased subsequent to the increase in FSH plasma concentration with a delay in 
the onset phase (Figure 4). The mean plasma concentration of oestradiol with follitropin delta increased more 
than 70-fold to a maximum mean of approx. 1.8 ng/mL, reached on Day 10, after which it declined. GONAL-F 
induced an oestradiol time-course of similar general appearance but with lower concentrations, the maximum 
mean concentration being approx. 1 ng/mL, a 38-fold increase from baseline, reached on Day 9.

Figure 4 Time-course of oestradiol concentration 
Progesterone 
Progesterone increased concomitant with the increase in FSH concentration, the maximum mean after follitropin 
delta administration being approx. 2-fold compared to baseline on Day 8, the day after the last administration, 
and to a lesser extent with GONAL-F. 
Luteinizing hormone (LH) 
Luteinizing hormone levels decreased throughout the assessment period to approx. half of the initial 
concentration that was obtained prior to the first administration, similar with both follitropin delta and GONAL-F. 
Number and size of the follicles 
Both the number and the size distribution of follicles changed during the treatment period of the study with both 
follitropin delta and GONAL-F. The mean number of follicles in the size categories ≥8 mm had increased on Day 
4 and with a few exceptions reached a maximum on Day 11, concomitant with a minimum number of follicles 
sized <8 mm (Figure 5). From Day 11 on, the number of follicles ≥8 mm decreased and the distribution shifted 
back to reach approx. baseline levels at the follow-up visit. Throughout the assessment period the numbers of 
follicles in all size categories were higher with follitropin delta compared to GONAL-F (Figure 5).

Figure 5 Mean number and size of follicles by time 
The frequency of subjects with follicles in the two largest size categories, ≥14 mm, increased following 
administration of the IMPs, and reached a maximum on Day 11 (Figure 6). On Day 11, 19 (79%) of the subjects 
given follitropin delta and 15 (63%) of the subjects given GONAL-F, had at least one follicle >15 mm. At the 
subsequent visits the frequency of subjects with large follicles decreased, and at the follow-up visit the 
frequency of subjects with follicles in the different size categories approached the baseline levels.

Study 000009 (Dose-response phase 2) 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to investigate the dose-response relationship of follitropin delta with respect to 
ovarian response in patients undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation. Secondary objectives included 
evaluation of the dose-response relationship of follitropin delta with respect to endocrine profile, oocyte 
fertilisation, number and quality of embryos and treatment efficiency and evaluation of the efficacy of follitropin 
delta with respect to achieving pregnancy. Randomisation was stratified by AMH serum level at screening 
(5.0-14.9 pmol/L and 15.0-44.9 pmol/L). 
Design 
This was a randomised, controlled, assessor-blind, parallel groups, multicentre trial. The trial was conducted in 
7 centers in 4 countries (Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark and Spain).  
Population 
The subjects were women of 18-37 years of age, diagnosed with tubal infertility, unexplained infertility, 
infertility related to endometriosis stage I/II or with partners diagnosed with male factor infertility, eligible for 
IVF and/or ICSI treatment. Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) associated with anovulation or 
endometriosis stage III-IV were excluded from participation.  
Treatments 
On day 2-3 of the menstrual cycle, subjects were randomised in a 1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio to treatment with daily 
doses of either 5.2 μg, 6.9 μg, 8.6 μg, 10.3 μg or 12.1 μg of follitropin delta (corresponding to 90 IU, 120 IU, 
150 IU, 180 IU or 210 IU, respectively) or the reference group GONAL-F 11 μg filled-by-mass (labelled as 150 
IU), and ovarian stimulation was initiated. 
Randomisation was stratified according to AMH level at screening (5.0-14.9 pmol/L and 15.0-44.9 pmol/L). The 
daily dose level of follitropin delta or GONAL-F was fixed throughout the entire stimulation period. During 
stimulation, subjects were monitored on stimulation day 1, 4 and 6 and hereafter at least every second day. 
When 3 follicles of ≥15 mm were observed, visits were performed daily. Subjects could be treated with follitropin 
delta or GONAL-F for a maximum of 16 days. 
To prevent a premature LH surge, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist (ganirelix acetate, 
ORGALUTRAN, MSD / Merck) was initiated on stimulation day 6 at a daily dose of 0.25 mg and continued 
throughout the stimulation period. Triggering of final follicular maturation was performed with recombinant hCG 
(Ovitrelle) or triptorelin acetate (Decapeptyl).  
Statistics 
The trial was powered to demonstrate a dose-response relationship of follitropin delta with respect to ovarian 
response in patients undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation. The primary endpoint was the number of 
oocytes retrieved. Accounting for subjects who would discontinue from the trial prior to oocyte retrieval or who 
would be excluded from the per-protocol (PP) population, it was planned to randomise 40 subjects to each of the 
six treatment groups, i.e. a total of 240 subjects.

Table 2 Number of oocytes retrieved (mITT) 
Table 3 Number of oocytes retrieved (PP) 
The response obtained with Gonal-F (11 µg dose) is similar to the response obtained with the 10.3 µg dose of 
follitropin delta in terms of number of oocytes retrieved (i.e. mean number of oocytes of about 10.5). 
A positive dose-response relationship between follitropin delta dose and number of oocytes retrieved was 
established, the effect was more marked in high AMH strata.

o  Number of fertilized oocytes and fertilization rate 
Table 8 Number of fertilized oocytes and fertilization rate 
A dose-response relationship was observed between follitropin delta dose and number of fertilized oocytes. The 
number of fertilized oocytes increased significantly while increasing follitropin delta dose.  
Higher fertilization rates are observed for low doses of follitropin delta (5.2 and 6.9 µg) and in the Gonal-F group. 
Differences between low doses of follitropin delta and Gonal-F are more marked in the low AMH strata. The 
fertilization rate decreased significantly while increasing follitropin delta dose. 
o  Number and size of follicles 
At follicular sizes of ≥ 10, ≥ 12 and ≥ 15 mm, the number of follicles increased with increasing follitropin delta 
dose. There was a significant dose-response relation between follitropin delta and follicular development at the 
end of stimulation.

Overall, LH on stimulation day 4 was statistically significantly (p<0.001) inversely proportional to follitropin 
delta dose, while there was no statistically significant relation on stimulation day 6 or at the end of stimulation.

o  Ongoing pregnancy rate and live birth rate from the fresh cycle 
Ongoing pregnancy rate and live birth rate were numerically higher in the Gonal-F group compared to the 
follitropin delta groups (all doses). For ongoing pregnancy, there is 7% difference between Gonal-F (47%) and 
highest follitropin delta dose (40%), going up to 12% when comparing Gonal-F to overall follitropin delta (35%). 
In high AMH subgroup, the difference is 2% between Gonal-F (48%) and highest follitropin delta dose (46%) 
and 10% if compared to overall follitropin delta (38%). 
No statistically significant relationship to follitropin delta dose is observed for Ongoing pregnancy rate and live 
birth rate. Treatment outcome rates were numerically higher in the high AMH stratum compared to low AMH 
stratum.

PK-PD modelling to establish an individualised follitropin delta dosing regimen 
A phase 2 trial 000009 in IVF/ICSI patients with prospective incorporation of AMH (randomization stratified by 
AMH) was conducted to characterize the dose-response curve associated with administration of follitropin delta. 
The number of oocytes retrieved (OR) was the primary endpoint. According to the applicant, this parameter 
is an appropriate marker of ovarian response as it provides a direct measure of the pharmacological action of 
FSH on follicular growth and development and thereby of the efficacy of FSH preparations. It has also been used 
as the primary endpoint in other dose-response trials for gonadotropins. 
AMH is produced by the ovarian granulosa cells. The serum level of AMH is a marker of the ovarian reserve as 
the number of antral follicles has been shown to correlate more strongly with serum AMH than with the serum 
level of FSH (Anckaert et al. 2012; Fanchin et al. 2003). The serum AMH level shows only minimal fluctuations 
during the menstrual cycle (La Marca et al. 2006). An association between basal AMH and ovarian response to 
gonadotrophin was first reported by Seifer et al. (2002). Since then, other studies have investigated the value 
of AMH in predicting oocyte yield in IVF. Serum AMH level is use on a regular basis in ART practice for predicting 
ovarian response, including excessive response and OHSS risk, to exogenous gonadotropins and thus for 
adjusting the starting dose of FSH. However, it should be underlined that serum AMH seems to have a poor 
predictive value for pregnancy after ART (Broer et al. 2009, 2010). The Applicant has justified the choice of AMH 
in this procedure as a marker on which to individualize dosing, in particular compared to age or other markers, 
and taking into account of AMH having a poor predictive value for pregnancy after ART. The Applicant explained 
that distinction should be made between the role of AMH for prediction of ovarian response and prediction of 
pregnancy. Based on literature data and from clinical trials performed by the Applicant, the role of AMH for 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 39/95 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
prediction of pregnancy is doubtful while it is considered as a robust predictor of ovarian response, better 
than gonadotropin. Since adequate ovarian response facilitates the chance of pregnancy and/or reduces safety 
concerns (mainly OHSS), AMH should be used for ovarian response prediction and is therefore the preferred 
biomarker for establishing an individualized dosing regimen. 
Of note, the proposed individualized dosing regimen based on AMH level and body weight is deemed to reduce 
the number of patients with hypo or hyperstimulation, compared to a regimen using the same dose for all 
subjects. This regimen has been established from a PK/PD modelling and has not been tested in a phase 2 trial 
before use in the phase 3 pivotal trial ESTHER-1. The proportion of subjects with extreme ovarian responses, 
defined as <4, ≥15 or ≥20 oocytes retrieved, is a secondary endpoint in ESTHER-1 trial.  
Results of study 000009 showed that the number of OR increased with weight-adjusted dose of follitropin delta, 
and that for a particular dose of follitropin delta, the number increased with the AMH level. Based on a population 
dose-OR modelling approach, this increase in OR with weight-adjusted dose was adequately described with a 
sigmoid Emax model. Furthermore, AMH concentration at baseline was the best predictor of the number of OR 
among AMH, FSH, inhibin B, antral follicle count before stimulation, and age. An additional PK/PD model was 
developed relating the exposure of follitropin delta to the number of OR, using AUC values derived from 
the estimates of CL/F in the population PK model. The structure of the model was identical to that of the 
dose-response model. Also, AMH was the best predictor of the number of OR. AUC was not found to 
be a better predictor of the number of OR than weight-adjusted dose. 
The dose-number of OR model was subsequently used to estimate, for a range of AMH levels, the dosing 
regimen in accordance with the established target. Based on considerations balancing efficacy (number of 
blastocysts available for transfer) and safety (risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome), the appropriate 
ovarian response was defined as 8-14 OR in the first treatment cycle, with a mean target of 11 oocytes. 
Simulations of the number of OR with the proposed dosing regimen showed that the distribution of patients 
according to OR is optimized; it resulted in more uniform ovarian response and fewer subjects with extreme 
ovarian response (<4 and ≥20 oocytes retrieved) than a regimen using the same dose for all subjects.  
The applicant considers that gonadotropin dose is not a predictor for pregnancy per se but rather dose is a 
predictor of ovarian response (i.e. number of oocytes retrieved and risk of OHSS). This argument was 
considered acceptable and it was also agreed that AMH levels are markers of ovarian reserve and ability to 
respond to gonadotropin.

Table 5 Follitropin delta proposed dosing regimen 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The choice of the pharmacodynamics parameters (inhibin-B, oestradiol, progesterone, and development of 
follicles) was considered adequate to describe pharmacodynamics properties of follitropin delta compared to 
Gonal-F. Pharmacodynamics effects observed with follitropin delta in the phase 1 study CS02 and in the phase 
2 study 00009 were consistent with the mechanism of action of the product, i.e. stimulation of ovarian function 
via FSH receptor expressed in the granulosa cells of the ovary. The pharmacodynamic responses as measured 
by means of inhibin-B, oestradiol, progesterone, and development of follicles were all more profound with 
follitropin delta compared to GONAL-F, at the same dosing in IU. 
Individualized dosing regimen 
The proposed individualized dosing regimen based on AMH level and body weight was deemed to reduce the 
number of patients with hypo- or hyperstimulation, compared to a regimen using the same dose for all subjects. 
The applicant has clarified that the daily dose by AMH concentration was calculated using PK-PD modelling which 
showed that the number of oocytes retrieved is influenced by AMH concentration and weight. The number of 
oocytes retrieved increased with weight-adjusted dose and also with AMH level. The impact of body weight 
appeared to be more relevant at lower doses of FE999049 and small increases in FE99049 had a direct 
correlation to the number of oocytes retrieved. The proportion of subjects with extreme ovarian responses, 
defined as <4, ≥15 or ≥20 oocytes retrieved, was a secondary endpoint in ESTHER-1 trial.  
Using protein content in µg instead of IU on the choice/calculation of the dose 
Multiple-dose administration of equal IU doses of follitropin delta and Gonal-F (225 IU) resulted in a higher 
ovarian response in women given follitropin delta compared to Gonal-F. The mechanism was unclear but 
according to the Applicant the differential glycosylation profile could explain the differences observed. 
Based on these results, the Applicant considered that the rat in vivo Steelman-Pohley bioassay might not 
fully reflect the potency of follitropin delta in humans as supported by biotransformation studies in mice 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 41/95 
  
  
  
 
 
and rats and that using the protein content (μg) in combination with a consistent drug substance quality 
profile would be more appropriate for expressing doses of follitropin delta than the bioactivity (IU). 
Consequences of using protein content in µg instead of IU on the choice/calculation of the dose, as clinician are 
used to IU and the risk of dosing errors already occurred in the clinical development. Based on the Applicant 
clarification provided during the procedure, the confusion between the µg and IU is unlikely to occur at physician 
level. Regarding patients, the Applicant revised the “instruction for use” with a patient-friendly layout to avoid 
errors related to wrong use of administration device.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In conclusion the pharmacokinetic characteristics of FE 999049 were considered well described. With regards to 
moderate and severe renal and hepatic impairment, the applicant added warnings in section 4.4 of SmPC 
regarding the lack of data in patients with moderate/severe renal and/or hepatic impairment.  
Pharmacodynamics effects observed with follitropin delta were consistent with the mechanism of action of the 
product, i.e. stimulation of ovarian function via FSH receptor expressed in the granulosa cells of the ovary. A 
positive relationship between follitropin delta dose and number of oocytes retrieved was established, for 
follitropin delta doses up to 12 µg. Multiple-dose administration of equal IU doses of follitropin delta and Gonal-F 
(225 IU) resulted in a higher ovarian response in women given follitropin delta compared to Gonal-F. The 
response obtained with the 11 µg dose of Gonal-F was similar to the response obtained with the 10.3 µg dose of 
follitropin delta in terms of number of oocytes retrieved (i.e. mean number of oocytes of about 10.5). Based on 
these considerations, the Applicant decided to use the protein content (μg) for expressing doses of follitropin 
delta instead of the bioactivity (IU) as measured by the rat in vivo Steelman-Pohley bioassay.

2.5.2.  Main study 
ESTHER-1 (phase 3 pivotal trial) 
Methods 
ESTHER-1 is a randomised, controlled, assessor blind, non-inferiority trial. ESTHER-1 is a multi-center trial 
conducted in 37 centres in Europe and outside Europe (Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, 
France, Italy, Poland, Russia, Spain, United Kingdom). 
Study Participants  
The trial included women undergoing their first IVF/ICSI cycle. The subjects had been diagnosed with tubal 
infertility, unexplained infertility, endometriosis stage I/II or had partners diagnosed with male factor infertility, 
and were considered eligible for IVF or ICSI. The allowed body mass index (BMI) was 17.5-32.0 kg/m2, thus 
including underweight, normal weight, overweight and obese patients. The exclusion criteria incorporated the 
contraindications for the use of gonadotropins. 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 42/95 
  
  
  
Treatments 
Subjects underwent controlled ovarian stimulation with an individualised dosing regimen of follitropin delta 
based on considerations of the subject’s AMH level and body weight, or with Gonal-F (follitropin alfa). The 
individualized dosing regimen was obtained from a PK/PD modelling approach based on a phase 2 PK/PD trial.  
Table 10  Follitropin delta dosing regimen 
The daily follitropin delta dose was fixed for each patient throughout the stimulation period in this trial.  
The daily Gonal-F dose was fixed for the first five stimulation days (150 IU) after which it could be adjusted by 
75 IU based on the individual response, which was within the recommendations in the labelling. The maximum 
daily dose allowed for Gonal-F was 450 IU.  
Patients started controlled ovarian stimulation on day 2-3 of the menstrual cycle with either follitropin delta or 
Gonal-F. A GnRH antagonist (cetrorelix, CETROTIDE) was initiated on stimulation day 6 at a daily dose of 0.25 
mg. The use of a GnRH antagonist protocol is acceptable as it reflects the clinical practice.  
Triggering of final follicular maturation was done as soon as ≥ 3 follicles with a diameter ≥ 17 mm were 
observed. If there were < 25 follicles with a diameter ≥ 12 mm, 250 µg recombinant human chorionic 
gonadotropin (choriogonadotropin alfa, OVITRELLE) was administered as triggering drug. In case of excessive 
follicular development, defined as ≥ 25 follicles with a diameter ≥ 12 mm, the investigator had for the scenario 
of 25-35 follicles with a diameter ≥12 mm the option of either cancelling the cycle or administering 0.2 mg GnRH 
agonist (triptorelin acetate, GONAPEPTYL) as triggering drug, while for the scenario of >35 follicles with a 
diameter ≥12 mm the cycle had to be cancelled. In case of poor follicular development, defined as the 
investigator judging that ≥3 follicles with a diameter ≥17 mm could not be reached by day 20, the cycle was 
cancelled. 
Blastocyst transfer policy: if the woman was ≤ 37 years at randomisation, a single blastocyst was transfered; if 
the woman was ≥ 38 years at randomisation, a single blastocyst was transfered if a good quality blastocyst was 
available and two blastocysts were transfered if a good quality blastocyst was not available. 
Vaginal progesterone tablets (ENDOMETRIN, Ferring Pharmaceuticals) 100 mg three times daily were provided 
for luteal phase support from the day after oocyte retrieval and until the day of the βhCG visit (13-15 days after 
transfer). 
Objectives 
The primary objective of ESTHER-1 was to demonstrate non-inferiority of follitropin delta compared with 
GONAL-F with respect to ongoing pregnancy rate and ongoing implantation rate in the fresh cycle in women 
undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation (co-primary endpoints). 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 43/95 
  
  
  
 
 
Secondary objectives included comparison of follitropin delta with GONAL-F with respect to ovarian response 
and safety profile. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The co-primary endpoints chosen (ongoing pregnancy rate and ongoing implantation rate) are a better estimate 
of treatment success than the number of oocytes retrieved. Although the number of oocytes retrieved reflect the 
specific efficacy of follitropin delta and Gonal-F, the number of oocytes retrieved does not influence the chances 
for clinical pregnancy and live birth in the literature [Qianfang Cai et al. Does the number of oocytes retrieved 
influence pregnancy after fresh embryo transfer? Plos One 2013]. Retrieving a reasonable number of oocytes is 
the key to obtain a sufficient number of good-quality embryos for transfer.

Sample size 
It was assumed that follitropin delta and GONAL-F were equally effective with respect to ongoing pregnancy and 
ongoing implantation, with expected rates of 25-30% leading to an approximate total sample size of 1,150 
patients in the modified intention-to-treat (mITT) analysis set (allowing for at most 8% patients with major 
protocol deviations and therefore excluded from the per-protocol (PP) population). As described in the clinical 
trial protocol, the overall ongoing pregnancy rate and overall ongoing implantation rate was monitored in a 
blinded manner, with the option of increasing the sample size if the observed rates were beyond the estimated 
25-30% used for the sample size calculation. The protocol outlined that a decision on possible sample size 
increase would be taken when data on the co-primary endpoints were available for 70-80% of the planned 
patients, and that the expected maximum number of patients to be randomised would be approximately 1,350. 
Based on a blinded review of ongoing pregnancy and ongoing implantation rates when data from 67% of the 
planned sample size were available, the overall rates in the trial were beyond the estimated 25-30% and it was 
therefore recommended to increase the sample size from the originally planned 1,150 randomised patients to 
1,300. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were screened within 60 days prior to randomisation for compliance with the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria. On day 2-3 of the menstrual cycle, subjects were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to treatment with either 
follitropin delta or GONAL-F, and stimulation was initiated. Randomisation was performed centrally through the 
e-CRF and was stratified by centre and according to age (<35, 35-37 and 38-40 years). 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 45/95 
  
  
  
Blinding (masking) 
The trial was assessor-blind and all investigators, embryologists and central laboratory personnel were blinded 
to treatment allocation throughout the trial.  
Statistical methods 
The non-inferiority limit for the difference between follitropin delta and Gonal-F was -8.0% for both co-primary 
endpoints and the trial was dimensioned to have 80% power of achieving the primary objective. The trial was 
not patient-blinded and the precautions taken to ensure the treatment allocations were not available to the 
investigators or other assessors were discussed during the procedure.

Recruitment 
The first patient first visit (FPFV) was on 8 October 2013 and the last patient last visit (LPLV/end of trial) was 11 
May 2015. 
Conduct of the study 
Major protocol deviation: 3 subjects who were randomised but not exposed were excluded from the mITT 
population. Subjects with major protocol deviations were excluded from the PP population.
This led to exclusion 
of additionally 71 subjects from the PP analysis set: 42 subjects (6.3%) in the follitropin delta group and 29 
subjects (4.4%) in the GONAL-F group. 
The most frequent major protocol deviations were as follows: blastocyst transfer policy was not adhered to 
(1.5%), subject did not receive the correct triggering drug (1.3%), the eligibility criteria were not met (1.1%), 
and subject received wrong daily dose of IMP for more than 1 day (1.0%) 
The major protocol deviations were balanced between treatment groups with the exception of deviations related 
to wrong dose of IMP and unblinding of treatment, which were primarily observed in the follitropin delta group. 
The IMP medication errors in the follitropin delta group were mainly due to incorrect use of pen. All cases of 
unblinding were accidental and the majority were related to the follitropin delta pen and use for instructions. 
Concerning the 8 cases of unblinding, a conservative approach was applied meaning that all cases were 
excluded from the PP analysis despite that one of the accidental unblindings occurred after the subject had 
completed the trial. 
Concerning the blastocyst transfer policy, the following major protocol deviations occurred: 10 subjects, 
consisting of 3 subjects aged ≤37 years and 7 subjects aged ≥38 years but with a good-quality blastocyst, who 
should have had single blastocyst transfer had double blastocysts transfer; 3 subjects who had blastocysts 
available but did not undergo transfer; 10 subjects who had no viable blastocysts or compacted morulas 
available underwent transfer. All cases were excluded from the PP analysis. 
•  Baseline data 
Demographic profile 
Concerning geographical distribution of the 1,326 exposed subjects, 79% were from the EU and 21% were from 
non-EU countries with 11% from Canada, 5% from Russia and 4% from Brazil. The mean age at randomisation 
was 33.4 years in the follitropin delta group and 33.2 years in the Gonal-F group. The age distribution at 
randomisation was balanced between the two groups.  
Table 37 Demographic profile - ESTHER-1 
EMA/11072/2017

The IVF/ICSI patients included in ESTHER-1 had a mean body weight of 64.0 kg and a mean BMI of 23.5 kg/m2 
with 2% being underweight, 69% being normal weight, 22% being overweight and 7% being obese. 
Patients had on average been infertile for 3 years, with the most frequent diagnoses being unexplained infertility 
(42%) and male factor infertility (40%). Overall, 71% of the population had primary infertility, i.e. had not 
previously achieved a clinical pregnancy either via natural conception or ART. While the treatment cycle in 
ESTHER-1 was the first controlled ovarian stimulation cycle for IVF/ICSI, 47% of the patients had previously 
undergone at least one ovulation induction cycle. 
Numbers analysed 
In the follitropin delta group, 623 subjects were analysed in the PP analysis set and 665 in the mITT analysis set. 
In the Gonal-F group, 632 subjects were analysed in the PP analysis set and 661 in the mITT analysis set. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Co-primary analysis 
Ongoing pregnancy rate (defined as at least one intrauterine viable fetus 10-11 weeks after 
transfer) 
The ongoing pregnancy rate in the PP population was 31.8% with FE 999049 and 32.6% with GONAL-F, with a 
95% CI for the difference of -6.0% to 4.3%. For the mITT population, the ongoing pregnancy rate was 30.7% 
with FE 999049 and 31.6% with GONAL-F, with a 95% CI for the difference of -5.9% to 4.1%. The lower bound 
of the 95% CI is above the pre-specified non-inferiority limit of -8.0%. 
For both analysis populations, the lower bound of the 95%CI was well above the pre-specified non-inferiority 
limit of -8.0%.

Ongoing implantation rate (defined as the number of intrauterine viable fetus 10-11 weeks after 
transfer divided by number of blastocysts transferred) 
Ongoing implantation rate (number of intrauterine viable fetuses 10-11 weeks after transfer divided by number 
of blastocysts transferred) was analysed for all patients with transfer. In the PP analysis set, 1,074 patients 
underwent transfer of a total of 1,111 blastocysts. In the mITT analysis set, 1,122 patients underwent transfer 
of a total of 1,169 blastocysts. 
The ongoing implantation rate in the PP population was 36.2% with follitropin delta and 36.9% with GONAL-F, 
with a 95% CI for the difference of -6.5% to 4.7%. For the mITT population, the ongoing implantation rate was 
35.2% with follitropin delta and 35.8% with GONAL-F, with a 95% CI for the difference of -6.1% to 4.8%. 
For both analysis populations, the lower bound of the 95% CI was well above the pre-specified non-inferiority 
limit of -8.0 %.

Positive βhCG Rate 
The positive βhCG rate in the PP population was 40.0% with FE 999049 and 41.5% with GONAL-F, with a 95% 
CI for the difference of -6.9% to 3.9%. For the mITT population, the positive βhCG rate was 38.6% with FE 
999049 and 40.2% with GONAL-F, with a 95% CI for the difference of -6.8% to 3.7%. 
Clinical Pregnancy Rate 
The clinical pregnancy rate in the PP population was 36.1% with FE 999049 and 37.5% with GONAL-F, with a 95% 
CI for the difference of -6.7% to 3.9%. In the mITT population, the clinical pregnancy rate was 34.9% with FE 
999049 and 36.5% with GONAL-F, with a 95% CI for the difference of -6.6% to 3.6%. 
Vital Pregnancy Rate 
The vital pregnancy rate in the PP population was 32.9% with FE 999049 and 34.3% with GONAL-F, with a 95% 
CI for the difference of -6.7% to 3.7%. For the mITT population, the vital pregnancy rate was 31.7% with FE 
999049 and 33.4% with GONAL-F, with a 95% CI for the difference of -6.7% to 3.4%. 
Implantation Rate 
The implantation rate in the PP population was 40.9% with FE 999049 and 42.5% with GONAL-F, with a 95% CI 
for the difference of -7.4% to 4.1%. For the mITT population, the implantation rate was 39.8% with FE 999049 
and 41.3% with GONAL-F, with a 95% CI for the difference of -7.0% to 4.2%. 
Number and Size of Follicles during Stimulation 
On stimulation day 6, the total number of follicles and the average follicle size were similar in the FE 999049 and 
GONAL-F groups. The size of the largest follicle present on stimulation day 6 and the average size of the 3 largest 
follicles observed were statistically significantly greater in the GONAL-F group compared to the FE 999049 group 
(p=0.015 and p=0.024, respectively). On stimulation day 6, there was no statistically significant difference 
between treatment groups with respect to the number of follicles ≥10 mm, ≥12 mm and ≥17 mm, while a 
minimal but statistically significant (p=0.008) difference was noted for the number of follicles ≥15 mm. 
At end-of-stimulation, there were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in terms of 
number and size characteristics of follicles. The average size of the 3 largest follicles was 18.7 ± 1.9 mm and 
18.8 ± 1.5 mm in the FE 999049 and GONAL-F groups, respectively. 
Triggering of final follicular maturation was to be initiated when ≥3 follicles with a diameter ≥17 mm were 
observed. 
At end-of-stimulation, there were no statistically significant differences between treatment groups in the 
number of follicles ≥10 mm, ≥12 mm, ≥15 mm or ≥17 mm. The average number of follicles ≥12 mm at 
end-of-stimulation was 10.8 ± 5.4 and 11.1 ± 6.0 in the FE 999049 and GONAL-F groups, respectively. The 
average number of follicles ≥17 mm at end-of-stimulation was 5.0 ± 2.8 and 5.1 ± 3.1 in the FE 999049 and 
GONAL-F groups, respectively. 
Cycle Cancellations due to Poor Ovarian Response or Excessive Ovarian Response 
A total of 47 subjects had the cycle cancelled prior to oocyte retrieval. The main reason for cycle cancellation was 
poor ovarian response (43 subjects). The proportion of subjects with cycle cancellations due to poor ovarian 
response was 3.8% in the FE 999049 group and 2.7% in the GONAL-F group.  
There were no cycle cancellations due to excessive ovarian response in both groups. The proportion of subjects 
with an excessive response (25-35 follicles ≥12 mm) leading to GnRH agonist triggering was statistically 
significantly (p=0.019) lower in the FE 999049 group (1.5%) than in the GONAL-F group (3.5%).

Number of Oocytes Retrieved – mITT 
The mean number of oocytes retrieved was 9.6 ± 5.8 in the FE 999049 group and 10.1 ± 6.6 in the GONAL-F 
group. In subjects with triggering of final follicular maturation, the mean number of oocytes retrieved was 10.0 
± 5.6 in the FE 999049 group and 10.4 ± 6.5 in the GONAL-F group. 
Ancillary analyses 
The following factors potentially impacting ongoing pregnancy were evaluated: insemination method, primary 
reason for infertility, primary infertility and smoking status. The primary analysis was repeated with subjects 
grouped according to the levels of each factor.

Supportive study 
ESTHER-2 was a supportive phase 3 study designed to evaluate the immunogenicity of follitropin delta and 
Gonal-F based on the presence of anti-FSH antibodies. Secondary objectives included evaluation of the efficacy 
and safety and cost-effectiveness. The trial also served to evaluate follitropin delta in a dose range below and 
above the doses in the pivotal phase 3 trial ESTHER-1. Subjects failing to achieve an ongoing pregnancy in 
ESTHER-1 (COS cycle 1) could be offered participation in the trial.  
The follitropin delta and Gonal-F daily dose in COS cycles 2 and 3 was dependent on the ovarian response in the 
previous cycle (cycle 1 in ESTHER-1). Reduction or increase of the dose was predefined by the Applicant. For 
example, subjects who obtained <4 oocytes or 4-7 oocytes were in the next cycle given a follitropin delta dose 
which was 50% and 25% higher, respectively, than in the previous cycle. Follitropin doses up to 24 µg could be 
administered in ESTHER-2. 
Interim results on pregnancies obtained from cryopreserved cycles were also provided by the Applicant as 
supportive data. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
A statistically significant relationship to follitropin delta dose for the number of oocytes retrieved is observed in 
the phase 2 study 00009.  Also in the phase 2 study 000009, ongoing pregnancy rate and live birth rate were 
numerically higher in the follitropin alfa group (11 µg dose) compared to the follitropin delta groups (5 doses, 
from 5.2 to 12.1 µg). For ongoing pregnancy, there is 7% difference between follitropin alfa (47%) and highest 
follitropin delta dose (40%), going up to 12% when comparing follitropin alfa to overall follitropin delta (35%) 
In high AMH subgroup, the difference is 2% between follitropin alfa (48%) and highest follitropin delta dose 
(46%) and is 10% if compared to overall follitropin delta (38%). 
In the pharmacodynamics studies, no statistically significant relationship to follitropin delta dose is observed 
for ongoing pregnancy rate and live birth rate. Treatment outcome rates were numerically higher in the high 
AMH stratum compared to low AMH stratum, which was expected as AMH is a predictor of ovarian response. The 
dosing of individuals with low AMH was discussed further during the procedure to alleviate the possibility that the 
doses explored were not high enough to determine dosing in these individuals e.g AMH <15pmol/L. 
ESTHER-1 study was not patient-blinded and the precautions taken to ensure the treatment allocations were 
not available to the investigators were discussed by the applicant during the procedure. It could not be 
established with certitude that the patients didn’t discuss their treatment allocation with the assessors. However 
the elements provided by the Applicant show that maximum possible precautions were taken in the set-up and 
conduct of the study to ensure that investigators or other assessors were kept blinded to treatment allocation. 
The issue was well addressed before the start of the study: (1) in the written informed consent document where 
the patient was advised about the importance of keeping the blind; (2) through the material given to patients 
(non-see-through bags); (3) with the appointment of 2 dedicated site staffs (one blinded, one unblinded); (4) in 
the e-CRF with different logging rights according to users’ prerogatives. The disproportion in the number of 
cases of unblinding between the two treatment groups (a majority occurring in the follitropin delta group) was 
noted. The absence of a double-dummy IMP presentation was appropriately justified by the Applicant. Moreover, 
the 8 cases of unblinding situation that occurred in the follitropin delta group were fully documented by the 
Applicant and do not jeopardize the outcome of the study. Finally, precautions were taken to avoid unblinding 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 57/95 
  
  
  
during co-monitoring visits with well specified procedures in the Sponsor Oversight Plan and Co-monitoring plan, 
and no unblinding was reported in the course of the study.  
The non-inferiority margin of -8% in Esther-1 study was considered acceptable in the CHMP Scientific Advice 
however this choice was discussed extensively during the procedure given the results from phase 2 study 00009 
suggested that the difference between follitropin delta and follitropin alfa on the criterion ongoing pregnancy 
rate could be at least of - 7% (absolute difference point estimate). Moreover, considering that the success rate 
of controlled ovarian stimulation followed by IVF/ICSI was generally low (less than 35%), an assumed absolute 
difference of – 8% on ongoing pregnancy rate represents a clinically significant loss of chance for a patient 
(relative difference of at least 20%). A non-inferiority limit of -5% should have been a more reasonable choice 
to limit the potential loss of chance for the patients. It should be underlined though that non-inferiority versus 
Gonal-F would not have been reached in the overall population with this -5% non-inferiority limit. The Applicant 
was therefore requested to justify the choice of the non-inferiority margin and discuss the reason why an 
absolute difference in ongoing pregnancy rate that could go up to -8% (and representing a significant loss of 
chance) could still be considered as a clinical benefit for the patient. The issue raised on the choice of the 
non-inferiority margin was not meant to question the agreement with EMA in the scientific advice, but rather to 
challenge the clinical relevance of the non-inferiority conclusion in the light of the actual results so that 
additional insurance could be brought to the small loss of efficacy observed in the trial. The Applicant did not 
initially provide thorough clinical discussion regarding thisThe main argumentation focused on the feasibility of 
the study based upon either a smaller non-inferiority margin or the results of the phase 2 dose-finding trial. It 
was unclear why the Applicant did not take into account the results of the ENGAGE study (with corifollitropin). 
The ENGAGE study, upon which was based the choice of the non-inferiority margin, provided a confidence 
interval lower bound of -4% for the ongoing pregnancy rate, which is higher than the non-inferiority margin of 
-8% and which could even guarantee a loss of efficacy less than 5%. It is agreed that the required sample size 
for the formal demonstration of -5% non-inferiority would have been more significant (2800 patients), but trials 
of such size are not that uncommon, and the size of the trial should always fit any relevant clinical objective. 
Regarding the phase 2 trial, there were some hints that the non-inferiority would be challenging for the ongoing 
pregnancy endpoint with the chosen non-inferiority margin. Without considering the full magnitude of the 
negative response observed in the phase 2 trial (which would require a tremendous amount of patients), it 
would have been wise to consider a small loss of efficacy in the sample size calculation of the pivotal study. This 
unanticipated loss of efficacy led, to some extent, to under power the phase 3 trial for the main subgroup of 
subjects ≤ 38 year old and put at risk a clear demonstration of the non-inferiority. Eventually the CHMP accepted 
the justification for the choice of non-inferiority margin (-8%) and considered this point as resolved.  
Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is a common anovulatory disorder and IVF is an effective treatment 
for PCOS patients. It was therefore quite surprising not to have PCOS patients in the study. The introduction of 
the inclusion criteria “Patients were to have regular menstrual cycles, presumed to be ovulatory” probably 
explain why no PCOS patients were included. The Applicant was asked to clarify why PCOS patients were 
explicitly excluded from the trial and if this lack of PCOS patients in the study should lead to a restriction of the 
indication. Indeed, PCOS patients are more at risk of OHSS and the benefit/risk profile of follitropin delta may be 
different in this population. The applicant clarified that PCOS patients were not excluded of ESTHER-1 study, 
only the subgroup with anovulatory PCOS could not enter to the trial. The reason why the subgroup of 
anovulatry PCOS patients were not included was that the inclusion of these patients could have influenced the 
co-primary endpoints of ongoing pregnancy and ongoing implantation rates. This choice was reflected in the 
SmPC section 4.2: “Anovulatory patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome have not been studied. Ovulatory 
patients with polycystic ovaries have been included in clinical trials”. Since PCOS patients were not excluded 
from trial, no restriction of indication was proposed, especially as the lack of anovulatory patients with PCOS in 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 58/95 
  
  
  
the phase 3 trials was reflected in the proposed SmPC. In addition, the applicant proposed and the CHMP agreed 
to add a brief summary in the SmPC on the fact that while anovulatory patients have not been studied, ovulatory 
patients have been studied.   
Adjustment of the starting dose in Esther-1 was only proposed for follitropin delta (individualised dosing 
regimen) and not for Gonal-F (fixed starting dose of 150 IU). It was acknowledged that the SmPC of Gonal-F 
doesn’t mention such possibility however it is a common practice in ART to adjust the starting dose of 
gonadotropins, for example taking into account AMH level, age of the woman, body weight or other parameters 
associated to previous ovarian stimulations. The Applicant was requested to comment on this aspect, as this 
could partly explain the lower efficacy of Gonal-F versus follitropin delta in the age strata 38-40 years. Indeed, 
this adjustment was particularly crucial for older patients with low AMH levels, who may not be given the best 
possible chances with a fixed starting dose of Gonal-F. The Applicant explained that there is no direct link 
between dose and pregnancy, rather, it is the patient’s ovarian response as a result of the dose administered 
which is the relevant interface between gonadotropin dose and treatment outcome in terms of both efficacy and 
safety. In addition, the ovarian response as well as blastocyst availability and quality in women 38-40 years was 
similar in two ESTHER-1 groups, indicating no difference in pregnancy potential between the two treatments in 
this age category. There was no statistically difference between the two products with investigator-requested 
dose adjustments during stimulation by age stratum or by AMH. Consequently, it was agreed that the starting 
dose of GONAL-F in the ESTHER-1 trial should not be seen as a reason for a numerically lower efficacy in women 
38-40 years compared to the follitropin delta group. 
In relation to the use of follitropin delta in different types of clinical protocols used for ovarian 
multifollicular development in women undergoing IVF/ICSI procedures, FE 999049 has been applied in a GnRH 
antagonist protocol during phase 2 and 3 trials, and thus the FE 999049 dosing algorithm has not been studied 
in a long GnRH agonist protocol. The Applicant was of the opinion that restricting the indication of FE 999049 to 
GnRH antagonist cycles seems unreasonable when the impact of the type of protocol on ovarian response, 
efficacy and safety parameters is well established and when there are no specific grounds for a clinically relevant 
efficacy or safety risk based on the product profile with the proposed dosing regimen compared to existing 
reference rFSH preparations. However, this was not agreed and the fact of no experience with Rekovelle in 
the long GnRH agonist protocol was added to section 4.1 of the SmPC.  
Gonapeptyl (triptorelin) to trigger ovulation was used off-label in Esther-1 study. It was acknowledged 
that GnRH agonist ovulation trigger has been discussed extensively in the literature in the past few years. In 
particular, the fact that GnRH agonist ovulation trigger may prevent ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
was often put forward. However, due to the fact that this use was off-label, only the use of recombinant or 
extractive beta-hCG was described in the SmPC of follitropin delta as recommended to trigger ovulation. The 
Applicant acknowledged that no GnRH agonist product was approved for triggering of final follicular maturation 
in IVF/ICSI cycles and that it therefore constitutes off-label use. In addition clinical data indicate that the use of 
GnRH agonist was not a strategy that would be free from the OHSS. Consequently, its clinical use in case of 
excessive follicular development is not included in the SmPC of follitropin delta. 
ESTHER-2 was a supportive immunogenicity trial, for which the dosing regimen used was based on ovarian 
response in ESTHER-1 study.  
For the PKPD and exposure response models the Applicant provided additional explanations. The updated 
POPPK model was re-run with the effects of age, race and renal function to determine exposure for use in the 
DER (dose-exposure-response) modelling. This showed similar estimated PD endpoints to those previously 
calculated with an EC50 = 7.36 h.ng/ml.  However it was not fully agreed that this is the optimum model.  
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 59/95 
  
  
  
The dosing for individuals with low AMH particularly was also further discussed to demonstrate that the doses 
explored were high enough to determine dosing in individuals with low AMH. The dose of 12.1 µg in subjects with 
low AMH was considered justified in terms of being less than the maximum approved dose. In addition the dose 
response relationship in these subjects appeared very flat.  It was considered that higher doses could have been 
investigated in these subjects, however given the data available there was some support for efficacy with the 
dose chosen.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
ESTHER-1 
A high proportion of ICSI (more than 80%) was performed in ESTHER-1, whereas male factors explain only 
about 40% of infertility in the trial population. Among the European countries participating in the ESTHER trials, 
the use of ICSI ranged from 45 % to 95% in 2011. The high proportion of about 80 % of ICSI performed in 
ESTHER-1 was considered to be in line with registry data from Europe. Thus, the frequency of ICSI cycles in 
ESTHER-1 is a reflection of the clinical practice in the high-recruiting countries.  
Across treatment groups and analysis populations, the ongoing pregnancy rate was in the range 31-33% and 
the ongoing implantation rate in the range 35-37%. For the two co-primary endpoints, the lower bound of the 
95% CI was above the pre-specified non-inferiority limit of -8.0%.  
Considering the results by age strata it was noted that the treatment effect was quite different depending on 
whether women are below or over 38 years old. For the ongoing pregnancy rate, although the maximum 
difference observed in the overall population is below the non-inferiority limit of – 8% (95% CI lower limit of - 
6%), in the subgroup of women aged 37 years and less (85% of the population) the difference between groups 
is equal to -3.1%, jeopardizing the non-inferiority. On the contrary, in the subgroup of women aged 38-40 years 
(15% of the population), the difference between groups is equal to +11.3%, making the non-inferiority easily 
reached. Very similar observation was true also for the ongoing implantation rate. These results could translate 
a qualitative interaction between treatment and age, compromising the overall result, given that the overall 
non-inferiority conclusion was driven by only 15% of the population. As part of the major objection the Applicant 
was asked to provide and discuss, in the context of the non-inferiority, results (point estimate, 95% CI) for the 
co-primary endpoints in the following age strata: women aged 37 years or less and women aged 38-40 years. 
Any loss of efficacy compared to Gonal-f was asked to be justified in the context of non-inferiority. This was seen 
by the CHMP of particular importance as age is a predictive factor for IVF success.  
Although the trial was indeed designed to demonstrate the efficacy of FE 999049 on the overall population, the 
non-inferiority was reached at the cost of some heterogeneity of responses in subgroups of age: there was an 
unexpected large positive response in a small subgroup of ≥ 38 year old women and a negative response in 
women < 38 year old. This last subgroup represented the very large majority of subjects included in the pivotal 
trial and all subjects included in the phase 2 dose-finding trial. These results raised concerns because: (1) The 
overall results might be driven by a small subgroup of subjects (≥ 38 year old) not much exposed to the drug in 
the development of the molecule; (2) It is well acknowledged that heterogeneity is artificially favouring the 
non-inferiority; (3) The indication claimed by the Applicant might exceed the trial findings. The targeted 
subgroups in the post hoc analysis were not like any other subgroups, they were clearly identified in the trial as 
stratification factors due to their clinical relevance. Therefore, complementary information about the reliability 
of the primary endpoint outcome in these specific subgroups (conditionally to their size) was needed. In order to 
dispel these concerns, the Applicant provided some new information that helped to clarify the issue. The most 
convincing new data provided by the Applicant was the analysis of the distribution of ongoing pregnancy and 
implantation rates across 1 year age strata from 25 to 40 year old. This analysis showed that there was no clear 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 60/95 
  
  
  
trend of decreasing efficacy with subjects getting younger. Finally, although there was some heterogeneity 
observed in the study outcome, the overall non-inferiority of FE 999049 over Gonal-F was accepted.  
Furthermore, considering the results by AMH level strata (Table 13) there was an indication that the chosen 
drug  regimen  was  not  adequately  justified  as  the  results  of  both  primary  endpoints  in  the  low  AMH 
stratum were suggestive of a numerical imbalance in ESTHER-1 in favour of GONAL-F: the ongoing 
pregnancy rate obtained was 29% for follitropin delta in comparison to 33% in the GONAL-F group and 34% in 
the high AMH stratum while ongoing implantation rate was 32.9% for follitropin delta and 36.8% in the GONAL-F 
group  for  PP  set.  The  point  estimates  with  95%  confidence  intervals  for  the  co-primary  endpoints  by  AMH 
stratum were asked to be provided and discussed. This was of seen as important as the individual fixed dose of 
follitropin delta was based on AMH level. The applicant was asked to justify in the context on non-inferiority any 
loss of efficacy compared to Gonal-f. This is of particular importance as AMH level is a predictive factor for IVF 
success. 
Table 13 
The applicant considered that gonadotropin dose was not a predictor for pregnancy per se but rather dose was 
a predictor of ovarian response (i.e. number of oocytes retrieved and risk of OHSS). This argument was 
acceptable and it was also agreed that AMH levels are markers of ovarian reserve and ability to respond to 
gonadotropin. To buttress this point, a table (table 14 ) showing the number of oocytes retrieved and percentage 
of subjects with successful transfer was provided which suggest no difference between FE 999049 and Gonal-F 
in women with AMH≤15pmol/L.  
Table 14 Blastocyst availability and quality in women with AMH<15 pmol/L 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 61/95 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
In terms of the analysis in women with AMH < 15 pmol/l, the numerical imbalance in favour of Gonal-F appears 
to persist with a treatment difference of -3.7% noted for ongoing pregnancy rate and -3.2% for ongoing 
implantation rate. However it was acknowledged that the observed pregnancy and ongoing rate implantation 
rate were similar to the expected pregnancy/ implantation rates and do not indicate a lack of efficacy. Taking 
into consideration also that the ESTHER-1 trial was not powered or designed to demonstrate non-inferiority 
within subgroups the applicant’s view that the results are due to random variation rather than a reduced efficacy 
of FE 999049 when compared to Gonal-F was accepted and this  major objection was considered as solved. 
Four secondary endpoints were agreed to be supportive to the analysis of the co-primary endpoints: positive 
ßhCG rate, clinical pregnancy rate, vital pregnancy rate and implantation rate. For the secondary 
endpoints “Positive ßhCG rate, clinical pregnancy rate, vital pregnancy rate and implantation rate, FE 999049 
appear to be non-inferior to Gonal-F overall. However when stratified by age, there appears to be a disparity. 
The same observations as for the co-primary endpoints “ongoing pregnancy rate” and “ongoing implantation 
rate” were made, i.e. results in the opposite direction for women aged 37 years or less compared to women ages 
38-40 years. In order to compare the results on key secondary endpoints with results obtained on co-primary 
endpoints, the Applicant was asked to provide the results for the secondary endpoints “Positive ßhCG 
rate/clinical pregnancy rate/vital pregnancy rate and implantation rate” in the following age strata, with the 
95% CI: women aged 37 years or less and women aged 38-40 years. This was provided but was not considered 
to be a significant issue as the Applicant rightly pointed out that the ESTHER-1 trial was not powered or designed 
to demonstrate non-inferiority with regards to secondary endpoints or within subgroups. In terms of the 
secondary endpoints by AMH levels for positive β hCG rate, clinical pregnancy rate, vital pregnancy rate and 
implantation rate; FE 999049 appeared to be non-inferior to Gonal-F in the group with AMH levels ≥ 15pmol/L 
using the -8% non-inferiority margin. In the <15pmol/L group this was not the case. However it was 
acknowledged that the trial was not powered or designed to demonstrate non-inferiority with regards to 
secondary endpoints. In addition the applicant has provided data which suggest that the noted imbalance was 
most probably due to random variation and was not considered to be clinically relevant. 
Regarding the number and distribution of oocytes retrieved, no significant differences between treatment 
groups in terms of number of oocytes retrieved were observed in any age stratum (< 35 years, 35-37 years and 
38-40 years). In subjects with AMH <15 pmol/L, statistically more oocytes were retrieved in the follitropin delta 
group and in subjects with AMH ≥15 pmol/L statistically less oocytes were retrieved in the follitropin delta group 
compared to Gonal-F. 
Oocyte / embryo development parameters such as fertilisation rate, number of fertilised oocytes as well 
as embryo quality on day 3, blastocyst quality on day 5 and availability of blastocysts for transfer 
and for cryopreservation were comparable overall in the two treatment groups. But differences according to 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 62/95 
  
  
  
 
 
age subgroups cannot be excluded given the results on the co-primary endpoints in women aged 37 years or 
less and women aged 38-40 years. 
Live birth rate in ESTHER-1: Based on the pregnancy outcome data available, the interim live birth rate was 
31.0% (114/368) with follitropin delta and 29.6% (110/371) with GONAL-F. 
ESTHER-2  
For the secondary efficacy endpoints, no statistical comparison were made by the Applicant between groups, 
only descriptive data were presented. In COS cycle 2, the ongoing pregnancy rate was 27.8% in the follitropin 
delta group and 25.7% in the GONAL-F group. In COS cycle 3, the ongoing pregnancy rate was 27.4% in the 
follitropin delta group and 28.0% in the GONAL-F group. Overall the ongoing pregnancy rates were lower 
compared to COS cycle 1. Results were not stratified by age, therefore it was not possible to see if the same 
interaction with age was observed as in ESTHER-1 trial.  
After adapting the follitropin delta dosing regimen in COS cycles 2 and 3 based on the subject’s ovarian response 
in the previous COS cycle, the targeted response of 8-14 oocytes retrieved was achieved by 45.3% and 
47.9% of the subjects treated with follitropin delta in COS cycle 2 and COS cycle 3, respectively, which was 
comparable to the rates of 45.2% and 48.9%, respectively, in the GONAL-F group. 
It was difficult to establish the benefit/risk ratio for doses of follitropin delta superior to 12 µg per day. 
Indeed, only few women have been treated with doses superior to 12 µg per day in the ESTHER-2 trial, in 
particular very few women have been treated with doses superior to 18 µg per day (5 women have received 
femmes a dose of 24 µg per day, 45 women have received a dose between 18 and 24 µg per day, 180 women 
have received a dose between 12 and 18 µg). No conclusion could be made on efficacy of follitropin delta at 
doses above 12 µg per day, as efficacy endpoints were exploratory in ESTHER-2. And no dose-response 
relationship was established in the phase 2 PD trial in terms of chance of pregnancy. The Applicant should 
further substantiate the benefits in terms of efficacy of exposing women to doses of follitropin delta superior to 
12 µg. The applicant explained that this was not based on any modelling or estimation and rather it was derived 
using clinical practice as a guide. This was accepted by the CHMP.  
The Applicant has provided also the distribution (mean, min and max) of the observed interval between COS 
cycle 1 and COS cycle 2/COS cycle 3, and between COS cycle 2 and COS cycle 3.  For subjects who after 
COS cycle 1 continued to participate in COS cycle 2, the average time between stimulation day 1 in the two 
cycles was 119 days in the FE 999049 group and 120 days in the GONAL-F groups. The minimum-maximum 
range of duration between COS cycle 1 and COS cycle 2 was also similar in the two groups, with 46-381 days and 
51-378 days, respectively, for FE 999049 and GONAL-F. Within the ESTHER-2 trial, the mean time between 
stimulation day 1 in COS cycle 2 and stimulation day 1 in COS cycle 3 was 107 days in the FE 999049 group and 
103 days in the GONAL-F group. The minimum time between start of COS cycle 2 and COS cycle 3 was 50 and 
48 days in the FE 999049 and GONAL-F groups, respectively, and the maximum time was 247 and 252 days, 
respectively.  
Additional data from cryopreserved cycles  
Patients with cryopreserved blastocysts in ESTHER-1 and ESTHER-2 could undergo cryopreserved cycles if 
initiated within one year after the patient’s start of stimulation of the last COS cycle in either of the trials. The 
blastocyst(s) used in a cryopreserved cycle could come from any of the COS cycles or from a combination of 
different COS cycles. In the cryopreserved cycles, a maximum of two blastocysts could be transferred at the 
discretion of the investigator and patient and in accordance with local practice. During the ESTHER-1 and 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 63/95 
  
  
  
ESTHER-2 trials, a total of 1,105 patients had 3,405 blastocysts cryopreserved by vitrification. Interim data on 
pregnancies from cryopreserved blastocysts obtained in ESTHER-1 and ESTHER-2 show an ongoing pregnancy 
rate of 30.8% and ongoing implantation rate of 27.5% in the follitropin delta group. 
Individualized dosing regimen based on AMH serum level and bodyweight 
It should be noted that adaptation of the dose of rFSH to AMH serum level and bodyweight is a current practice 
in ART, although this was not reflected in the SmPC of authorized rFSH. In ESTHER-1, the follitropin delta dose 
was fixed during the cycle but adapted to AMH serum level and bodyweight, whereas the Gonal-F starting dose 
was the same for every woman, whatever her AMH serum level or bodyweight (and if needed adjusted after 5 
days of stimulation according to the ovarian response). Thus, a number of benefits were logically expected from 
this individualized dosing regimen. 
Regarding the ongoing pregnancy rate and ongoing implantation rate (co-primary endpoints) in the 
low AMH stratum, the numerical imbalance in favour of Gonal-F appears to persist with a treatment difference 
of -3.7% noted for ongoing pregnancy rate and -3.2% for ongoing implantation rate. However it was 
acknowledged that the observed pregnancy and ongoing rate implantation rate were similar to the expected 
pregnancy/ implantation rates and did not indicate a lack of efficacy. Taking into consideration also that the 
ESTHER-1 trial was not powered or designed to demonstrate non-inferiority within subgroups the applicant’s 
view that the results are due to random variation rather than a reduced efficacy of FE 999049 when compared 
to Gonal-F was accepted. 
Secondly, it can be observed that the individualized dosing regimen of follitropin delta resulted in a more 
uniform ovarian response across AMH and body weight compared to that obtained after treatment with 
GONAL-F. Statistically significantly more patients had an appropriate ovarian response, defined for follitropin 
delta as 8-14 oocytes, compared to GONAL-F but no adjustment for multiplicity was made on secondary 
endpoints and therefore it is not possible to conclude regarding this. More importantly, it did not translate into 
a better pregnancy rate. 
Finally, the proportion of subjects with cycle cancellations due to poor ovarian response was not significantly 
different, and numerically a higher proportion of cancellations was observed in the follitropin delta group (3.8 % 
vs 2.7% in the GONAL-F group). Therefore no benefits in terms of risk of cycle cancellation was provided by 
follitropin delta and its individualized dosing regimen. 
A dose calculator application was developed and was intended for the use of clinicians to calculate the daily 
doses based on body weight and the anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) value obtained from the AMH assay. The 
application might be considered part of a system in the context of the use with an AMH assay and the 
administration device. The Applicant confirmed the compatibility of the application calculation model with the 
particulars of the instructions in section 4.2 of the SmPC.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The two main issues raised as major objections during current procedure were: results of co-primary 
endpoints by age strata and by AMH level strata. The Applicant provided extensive justifications regarding 
both points.  
Although the trial was indeed designed to show the efficacy of FE 999049 on the overall population, the 
non-inferiority was demonstrated at the cost of some heterogeneity of responses in some age subgroups 
(namely above and below 38 years old). There was an unexpected large positive response in a small subgroup 
of ≥ 38 year old women contrary to a response in women < 38 year old. This last subgroup represented 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 64/95 
  
  
  
the very large majority of subjects included in the pivotal trial as well as all subjects included in phase 2 
dose-finding trial. Therefore, complementary information about the reliability of the primary endpoint in these 
specific subgroups was provided. The most convincing data was the analysis of the distribution of ongoing 
pregnancy and implantation rates across 1 year age strata from 25 to 40 year old. This analysis demonstrated 
that there is no clear trend of decreasing efficacy as subjects get younger. Therefore, although there was some 
heterogeneity observed in the study outcome, the overall non-inferiority of FE 999049 over Gonal-F could be 
accepted.  
Regarding the results of co-primary endpoints by AMH level strata, the applicant considered that 
gonadotropin dose is not a predictor for pregnancy per se but rather dose is a predictor of ovarian response (i.e. 
number of oocytes retrieved and risk of OHSS). This argument was accepted by the CHMP and it was also agreed 
that AMH levels are markers of ovarian reserve and ability to respond to gonadotropin. To support this argument 
the Applicant provided the number of oocytes retrieved and percentage of subjects with successful transfer 
which suggest no difference between FE 999049 and Gonal-F in women with AMH≤15pmol/L. Regarding the 
co-primary endpoints in the low AMH stratum, the numerical imbalance in favour of Gonal-F appeared to persist 
with a treatment difference of -3.7% for ongoing pregnancy rate and -3.2% for ongoing implantation rate. 
However it was acknowledged that the observed pregnancy and implantation rate were similar to the expected 
pregnancy/ implantation rates and did not indicate a lack of efficacy. Taking into consideration also that the 
ESTHER-1 trial was not powered or designed to demonstrate non-inferiority within subgroups the CHMP agreed 
with the applicant that the results could be due to random variation rather than a reduced efficacy of FE 999049 
when compared to Gonal-F. 
Important issue on the choice of the non-inferiority margin was meant to challenge the clinical relevance of 
the non-inferiority conclusion in the light of the actual results so that additional insurance could be brought to 
the small loss of efficacy observed in the trial. The ENGAGE study (with corifollitropin alfa), upon which the 
non-inferiority margin was based, provided a confidence interval lower bound of -4% for the ongoing pregnancy 
rate, which was higher than the non-inferiority margin of -8% and which could even guarantee a loss of efficacy 
less than 5%. The required sample size for the formal demonstration of -5% non-inferiority would have been 
more significant (2800 patients), but trials of such size are not that uncommon, and the size of the trial should 
always fit any relevant clinical objective. Regarding the phase 2 trial, there were some hints that the 
non-inferiority would be challenging for the ongoing pregnancy endpoint with the chosen non-inferiority margin. 
Without considering the full magnitude of the negative response observed in the phase 2 trial (which would 
require a tremendous amount of patients), it would have been wiser to consider a small loss of efficacy in the 
sample size calculation of the pivotal study. This unanticipated loss of efficacy led, to some extent, to under 
power the phase 3 trial for the main subgroup of subjects ≤ 38 year. 
Although a more uniform ovarian response was observed with individualized dosing regimen of follitropin 
delta, it did not translate into a better pregnancy rate, and in fact even a lower pregnancy rate was observed in 
women aged 37 years and less. No additional benefits in terms of risk of cycle cancellations due to poor ovarian 
response were obtained with follitropin delta as compared to Gonal-F.  
In addition, the Applicant committed (REC) to annually assess available AMH assays, and whether other AMH 
assays could be used to measure AMH for calculation of the REKOVELLE dose, and if so to revise the SmPC 
accordingly  
In conclusion, the CHMP considered the efficacy of follitropin delta established.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
A total of 1,769 subjects have been included in the seven completed clinical trials that contribute to the 
follitropin delta safety database. Of them, 995 subjects were exposed to follitropin delta; 108 patients were 
treated within the phase 1 trial,  222 patients were treated within the phase 2 and 665 patients were treated 
within the phase 3 clinical trial ESTHER-1 where the starting dose was individualized based on AMH level and 
women bodyweight. This dosing regimen used in the phase 3 study was similar to the one recommended in the 
SmPC. At the end of ESTHER 1, patients who failed to achieve pregnancy (252 in follitropin delta group) 
underwent a second ovarian stimulation cycle within the study ESTHER 2. Those who failed to achieve 
pregnancy after this second stimulation cycle (95 under follitropin delta) underwent a third stimulation cycle 
which was part of the study ESTHER-2.  
Thereby, 665 patients were exposed to follitropin delta using the same regimen as the recommended in the 
agreed SmPC. The total number of exposure to follitropin delta in the clinical program (regardless of the dose) 
was 995 patients (1234 cycles). This number was lower than the minimum exposure required for a new active 
substance (i.e. 1500 patients as per ICH E1 Population Exposure: The Extent of Population Exposure to Assess 
Clinical Safety [CPMP/ICH/375/95]). However, it was noted that the safety profile of this active substance 
(rFSH) was likely to be comparable to other rFSH. Also, the global safety profile obtained from the pivotal trial 
did not raise a specific new concern. The route of administration used to administer follitropin delta or follitropin 
alfa was the SC injections. 
Dose and duration of exposure 
The four phase 1 trials comprised three single-dose trials and one multiple-dose trial with daily administration 
for 7 days. In the phase 2 trial 000009, the average duration of stimulation was 8-10 days, with an allowed 
maximum of 16 days.  However, the treatment period decreased with increasing follitropin delta doses. The 
median duration of exposure to FE 999049 was 9 days in all three COS cycles in the ESTHER-1 and ESTHER-2 
trials, with an allowed maximum of 20 days. In the ongoing phase 2 trial in Japan, the allowed maximum is 16 
days of stimulation.  
The FE 999049 doses in the phase 1 trials included a range of 37.5-450 IU as a single SC dose, 225 IU as a single 
IV dose and 225 IU as daily SC dose for 7 days.  
The phase 2 trial 000009 covered five different daily doses of FE 999049 in the range 5.2-12.1 μg. In the phase 
3 programme, IVF/ICSI patients randomised to FE 999049 treatment in ESTHER-1 had their individual dose 
determined on the basis of their serum AMH concentration analysed using ELECSYS AMH Plus immunoassay 
from Roche Diagnostics and measurement of their body weight. 
Table 15 
Exposure by FE 999049 Dose in ESTHER-1 and ESTHER-2. 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 66/95 
  
  
  
 
In patients with AMH <15 pmol/L the daily FE 999049 dose was 12 μg irrespective of body weight, and in 
patients with AMH ≥15 pmol/L the daily FE 999049 dose was 0.19 to 0.10 μg/kg in a decreasing manner by 
increasing AMH. The daily FE 999049 dose was fixed throughout the stimulation period. The maximum allowed 
daily FE 999049 dose was 12 μg. Patients could be treated with FE 999049 for a maximum of 20 days. 
The mean daily dose of FE 999049 was as follows in the ESTHER trials: 10.2 ± 2.3 μg in COS cycle 1, 12.0 ± 3.6 
μg in COS cycle 2, and 14.6 ± 5.1 in ESTHER-2 COS cycle 3. The mean total dose of FE 999049 was 90.0 ± 25.3 
μg in COS cycle 1, 107.7 ± 39.2 μg in COS cycle 2, and 130.0 ± 57.5 μg in COS cycle 3. 
Demographic characteristics 
The majority of patients in the clinical development program was recruited at clinics located in the EU (82.3%), 
followed in decreasing order by Canada (9.6%), Russia (4.5%) and Brazil (3.6%). For the ESTHER-1 trial, 
78.7% of the patients were from the EU, 11.5% from Canada, 5.4% from Russia and 4.4% from Brazil. Patients 
included in the completed phase 2 and 3 trials were on average 33 years of age, with 61% of the women being 
younger than 35 years and 39% being 35 years or older, distributed as 26% being 35-37 years and 13% being 
38-40 years. The majority (95%) of women in the completed phase 2 and 3 trials were Caucasians and of 
non-Hispanic/non-Latino ethnicity. 
The allowed BMI covered the range of 17.5-32.0 kg/m2, thus including underweight, normal weight, overweight 
and obese patients. Infertility for at least one year was required for patients ≤37 years and for at least 6 months 
for patients ≥38 years. Diagnoses of tubal infertility, unexplained infertility, and endometriosis stage I/II or 
partners diagnosed with male factor infertility were allowed, with the requirement that the patient/couple was 
eligible for IVF/ICSI treatment. 
Overall, the demographic profile and baseline characteristics were similar in both follitropin delta and follitropin 
alfa groups. The clinical study population was comparable to the target population to be treated. 
Regarding concomitant treatments, in addition to the stimulation treatment (either REKOVELLE or GONAL-F), 
the phase 3 trial protocol envisaged the use of other treatments. These treatments were: GnRH antagonist 
(CETROTIDE) to postpone ovulation at day 6 of stimulation, rhCG (choriogonadotropin alfa, OVITRELLE) for 
triggering follicular maturation, vaginal progesterone (ENDOMETRIN) to support luteal phase. Of note,   
according to the protocol, GONAPEPTYL (GnRH agonist) could be used in patients at risk of OHSS instead of 
OVITRELLE. Also the use of dopamine agonist could be envisaged to prevent hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) 
in patients with follicles size between 12 and 20 mm. Among all the mentioned concomitant treatments, GnRH 
agonist (GONAPEPTYL) and dopamine agonists were used in an off-label approach (as their indications do not 
include the prevention of OHSS). Results from clinical studies ESTHER 1 and ESTHER 2 show that patients were 
not treated in combination with a GnRH agonist protocol. Therefore it was agreed to reflect in section 4.1 of the 
SmPC the lack of experience with REKOVELLE use in a long GnRH agonist protocol.   
Adverse events 
The Applicant submitted two separated analysis of the “undesirable effects”; the first one included all observed 
adverse events without specific relation with the treatment and the second one included adverse drug reactions 
(ARD = adverse events that emerged after the treatment intake, with a reasonable possibility of causal 
relationship with the investigational product).  
In this assessment report, accent will be put on ADR observed during phase 3 studies ESTHER-1 and ESTHER-2, 
considering that a suitable analysis of the causal relationship was performed by the investigator. The causal 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 67/95 
  
  
  
relationship to investigational medical product was assessed by the investigator for each adverse event as 
“reasonable possibility” or “no reasonable possibility”, with the first category being subsequently referred to as 
“adverse drug reactions”.  
In the study ESTHER-1, the most frequently reported adverse drug reactions were in the SOCs “reproductive 
system and breast disorders” (10.1% for follitropin delta and 9.8 % for GONAL-F followed by “nervous system 
disorders” (5.6% with follitropin delta vs 5% with Gonal-F), “gastrointestinal disorders” (3.2% with follitropin 
delta, 2% with GONAL-F) and “general disorders and administration site conditions” (2% with follitropin delta 
and 0.9% with GONAL-F).  
The most frequently reported ADRs were headache (5.3% with follitropin delta vs 4.5% with GONAL-F), pelvic 
discomfort (3.8% and 3.2%, respectively), OHSS (3 % and 3.6 %, respectively), pelvic pain (2% and 2.6% 
respectively), adnexa uteri pain (1.2 % and 0.6%, respectively). 
In the study ESTHER-2 COS cycle 2, the ADRs the most frequently reported were also in the SOCs “reproductive 
system and breast disorders” (6.3% for follitropin delta and 9.6% for GONAL-F) followed by “nervous system 
disorders” (3.6 % follitropin delta vs 5% with Gonal-F). The most frequently reported ADRs reported in COS 
cycle 2 were: headache (3.2% and 3.8 % respectively), pelvic discomfort (2% and 2.3%, respectively), Adnexa 
uteri pain (2% and 1.9%, respectively), Pelvic pain 1.6% and1.5% respectively). 
In the study ESTHER-2 COS cycle 3, the safety profile of REKOVELLE was comparable with COS 2, with a lower 
frequencies of all the ADRs in both treatment groups. No new ADR emerged in patients treated within the 
ESTHER 2 COS 3.  
Overall, the safety profile of REKOVELLE (follitropin delta) was comparable in the studies ESTHER-1 and -2 with 
regard to the type of ADR reported. There was a general decrease in the frequency of all the ADRs across the 
cycles. The repeated treatment cycles raised no new adverse drug reaction. 
There was no apparent effect of the dose on the frequency of ADRs in subjects treated with REKOVELLE in each 
COS cycle. No marked change was observed with increasing dose. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths have been reported in subjects participating in the completed phase 1, 2 or 3 trials. The incidence of 
SAE in patients treated with follitropin delta in the whole program was low (1.7%). In the phase 3 trials, SAEs 
were reported by 20 patients (2.0%, 22 SAE) in 1,012 cycles with follitropin delta and by 15 patients (1.5%, 17 
SAE) in 1,015 cycles with GONAL-F.

Level 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 68/95 
  
  
  
 
Comparison of SAE between the two treatment groups did not show a notable difference in the general 
frequency;  
The most frequently observed SAE in patients who had undergone controlled ovarian stimulation (with either 
follitropin delta or GONAL-F) were: 
- OHSS (3 cases with REVOKELLE and 8 with GONAL-F, with longer mean hospitalisation duration in GONAL-F 
group (mean duration = 8 days) compared to REKOVELLE (men duration = 4 days),  
- Various pregnancy complications such as haemorrhage in pregnancy (6 cases with REKOVELLE and 2 with 
GONAL-F, all assessed with no reasonable causal relationship to IMP), vomiting in pregnancy, and pregnancy 
losses including ectopic pregnancy.  
Also, one case of adnexal torsion (ovarian torsion), with no association to OHSS, occurred in a single patient 
exposed to follitropin delta and recovered after surgery. The causal relationship to the investigational medicinal 
product was assessed as no reasonable possibility, by both investigator and applicant.  
Also, there was no apparent effect of REKOVELLE dose on the frequency of patients reporting SAE events in the 
completed phase 3 trials where daily REKOVELLE doses up to 24 μg were used.

Adverse event of special interest 
Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is an iatrogenic complication of ovarian stimulation that 
occurs during either the luteal phase or early pregnancy. The syndrome refers to a combination of ovarian 
enlargement due to multiple ovarian cysts and an acute fluid shift from the intravascular space into the third 
compartment due to increased capillary permeability. Incidences are unknown because of lack of systematic 
registration. OHSS is still today one of the major complications of ovarian stimulation, with registry data 
indicating incidences of up to 2.6% in European countries despite major under-reporting. Early OHSS usually 
occurs after triggering of final follicular maturation in association with an exaggerated ovarian response to 
gonadotropin stimulation while late OHSS develops in association with pregnancy. Particularly those cases which 
constitute a combination of the underlying ovarian hyperstimulation followed by pregnancy are serious and 
long-lasting. 
Early OHSS → OHSS with onset ≤9 days after triggering of final follicular maturation. Only early forms are 
preventable. 
Late OHSS → OHSS with onset >9 days after triggering of final follicular maturation. This form is more of 
concern than the early form. 
Classification of OHSS’s grade (1, 2, 3, 4 or 5) was based on Golan’s classification system and all OHSS 
cases were graded as mild, moderate or severe. The methodology for assessing OHSS was in line with the CHMP 
position provided within the SA procedure.  
Table 17: OHSS Classification 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 70/95 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
In ESTHER-1 and ESTHER-2 trials, the pre-defined options for interventions to prevent early OHSS included: 
cycle cancellation due to excessive ovarian response (defined as ≥25 follicles of ≥12 mm), triggering of final 
follicular maturation with GnRH agonist (criterion of 25-35 follicles of ≥12 mm), and administration of dopamine 
agonist (in patients with ≥20 follicles of ≥12 mm). None of the mentioned drugs used as preventive intervention 
approach for early OHSS (i.e. administration of GnRH agonists or dopamine agonist) has a corresponding 
approved indication l (i.e. prevention of OHSS). Thus, these drugs should not be mentioned in the REKOVELLE 
SmPC. 
Risk factors for severe OHSS may be related to patient’s characteristics or to the management of the ovarian 
stimulation. Also, existing literature data did not describe the extent to which indices of ovarian response, such 
as the peak serum E2 concentration, the number of ovarian follicles, and the number of oocytes retrieved, could 
predict the two forms of OHSS. Based on available publications, although several individual parameters can be 
regarded as OHSS risk factors (young age, low body weight, baseline AMH, antral follicle count, thrombotic risk 
factors), it was agreed that OHSS may occur despite absence of any risk factors. 
In follitropin delta development program, baseline AMH level was used as a quantitative biomarker of the 
ovarian response to stimulation in order to individualize the dosing regimen and to minimize the risks of OHSS. 
This was in line with the clinical practice. As no etiologic treatment is available against OHSS, the therapeutic 
management of OHSS should focus on its related-complications. Thrombotic complications that can occur in 
venous or arterial vessels represent the major risk, possibly conducting to myocardial infarction and 
cerebrovascular accidents. Once the OHSS is diagnosed, prevention of thrombotic accidents remains the major 
issue. 
From ESTHER 1 study, results showed that total OHSS (both early and late forms) with REKOVELLE was 3.5%, 
and with GONAL-F 4.8%. However, the difference between the two groups was not statistically significant 
(p=0.238). Early OHSS was experienced by 17 patients in the follitropin delta group (2.6%) and 20 patients in 
the GONAL-F group (3.0%) in ESTHER-1. Here also, the statistical significance was not reached (p=0.291). 
Preventing interventions for early OHSS covered cycle cancellation, administration of GnRH agonist and 
administration of dopamine agonist. Proportion of patients who had preventive interventions was statistically 
significantly lower (p=0.005) in the follitropin delta group (2.3%, 15 cases) compared to the GONAL-F group 
(4.5%, 30 cases). As mentioned above, only early (benign) cases of OHSS were preventable. Late form of OHSS 
raise more concern as they were usually of higher intensity, might be refractory despite active interventions 
(such as paracentesis, intravenous albumin, and anti-thrombotic prophylaxis). 
Independent of gonadotropin preparation, the risk of resorting to preventive interventions for early OHSS in 
ESTHER-1 increased with the patient’s AMH concentration. Most of the preventive interventions for early OHSS 
in ESTHER-1 were performed in patients in the highest AMH quartile (corresponding to AMH >25.35 pmol/L). 
Among these patients, preventive interventions were made in 5.0% of patients treated with follitropin delta and 
14.5% of patients treated with GONAL-F. Proportion of patients with late OHSS was 0.9% with REKOVELLE and 
1.8% with GONAL-F. Here also, the statistical significance was not reached (p=0.320). Statistically significant 
decrease with REKOVELLE versus GONAL F was also observed in “OHSS any grade and/or preventive 
interventions” (4.7%, 6.2% respectively. p=0.046). 
In summary, based on ESTHER 1 results, the treatment with REKOVELLE was not associated with statistically 
lower cases of OHSS (total, early or late) despite the individualized dosing regimen adopted in the study. 
However, a significant decrease in “preventive interventions for early OHSS” was observed; indeed, proportion 
of patients needing such interventions was statistically lower with REKOVELLE (follitropin delta) in comparison 
with GONAL-F.

Pregnancy loss Early pregnancy loss was defined as a positive serum βhCG test but no viable fetus at the 
ongoing pregnancy visit 10-11 weeks after blastocyst transfer. Among patients with a positive βhCG test in the 
controlled ovarian stimulation cycle, the rate of early pregnancy loss was comparable between the two groups 
in the study ESTHER 1. The rates of early pregnancy loss with follitropine delta and GONAL-F across the COS 
cycles were:  20.6 % and 21.4 % in COS cycle 1, 26% and 23% in COS cycle 2, 35% and 23 % in COS cycle 3 
for follitropine delta and GONAL-F respectively. Of note, the number of patients treated in each COS cycle 
decreased across the cycles and a direct comparison between the rates across the cycles could not be done. 
Biochemical pregnancy and spontaneous abortion each accounted for around half of the early pregnancy losses 
in the ESTHER-1 and ESTHER-2 trials. Ectopic pregnancies were infrequent in both treatment groups. Interim 
data available from cryopreserved cycles using blastocysts from ESTHER 1 and ESTHER 2 suggest that findings 
are comparable with those obtained from fresh cycles.  
Late pregnancy loss was defined as a viable fetus at the ongoing pregnancy visit but no live birth. For the 
completed phase 3 trials, interim data on late pregnancy losses were available for the controlled ovarian 
stimulation cycles and the cryopreserved cycles. Pregnancy outcome data (late pregnancy loss, live birth, 
stillbirth) were at this time available for 290/602 patients (48%), distributed as 148 and 142 patients in the 
follitropin delta and GONAL-F groups, respectively. In the REKOVELLE group 6 patients had late pregnancy loss 
of 7 fetuses/neonates. In the GONAL-F group, 6 patients had late pregnancy loss of 7 fetuses/neonates. 
Concerning cryopreserved cycles, so far no late pregnancy losses have been reported in cycles using 
cryopreserved blastocysts from the ESTHER-1 and/or ESTHER-2 trials. 
In summary, based on interim data set, rate of late pregnancy loss did not suggest a difference between the two 
treatment groups (for each group, 5 cases in COS cycle 1 and 1 case in COS cycle 2). Completed data on 
pregnancy follow-up from fresh cycles was submitted at day 120 of the procedure and results did not suggest a 
special concern with REKOVELLE. Completed follow-up data from cryopreserved cycles for both ESTHER 1 and 
ESTHER 2 studies will be submitted not later than Q1 2017. 
Multiple pregnancy The risk of multiple pregnancy in patients undergoing controlled ovarian stimulation is 
mainly related to the number and quality of embryos/blastocysts transferred and the patient’s age. Twin 
pregnancies in pregnant women who had undergone double blastocyst transfer was observed at a rate of 33.3% 
(12/36) for follitropin delta and 30.6% (11/36) for GONAL-F. Twin pregnancies in pregnant patients after single 
blastocyst transfer were observed for 1.9% (5/264) and 3.4% (9/266) in the follitropin delta and GONAL-F 
groups, respectively. In summary, the rates of multiple pregnancies (twins) were 5.7% % and 6.6% with 
REKOVELLE and GONAL-F respectively. There was no higher-order pregnancies in any of the treatment groups. 
Laboratory findings 
Extent of change in clinical chemistry and haematology parameters was similar in both GONAL-F and 
REKOVELLE (FE999049) groups. No clinically relevant changes in mean values of systolic blood pressure, 
diastolic blood pressure or pulse from baseline to end-of-trial were observed in any treatment groups in the 
completed phase 2 and phase 3 trials. There were no apparent trends or dose-related changes in the ECGs after 
exposure to follitropin delta in any of the phase 1 trials. Of note, the effects of follitropin delta on QT interval 
prolongation have been assessed in healthy female volunteers after IV administration of 225 IU (000020) 
resulting in an actual, not baseline-corrected, average Cmax of 62 IU/L and after repeated SC administration of 
225 IU during 7 consecutive days (CS02) resulting in an actual, not baseline-corrected, average Cmax of 22 
IU/L. The observed mean change from baseline in QTcF was approximately -5 msec immediately after IV 
administration (i.e. Cmax) and approximately -2 msec at 1 hour after IV administration. For SC administration, 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 72/95 
  
  
  
   
the change from baseline in QTcF from baseline was approximately 1 msec at 12 hours after the last injection 
(i.e. Cmax). Based on the observations and the class of compound, a thorough QT study with follitropin delta has 
not been conducted. 
Safety in special populations 
REKOVELLE is not intended for use in children and the elderly. Safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics of 
REKOVELLE in patients with renal or hepatic impairment have not been established. It is however noted that 
REKOVELLE is thought to be metabolised in the kidney.  
Race and ethnicity, 95% of the IVF/ICSI patients in the completed phase 2 and 3 trials, including 94% of the 
population in the phase 3 program, were Caucasians and of non-Hispanic / non-Latino ethnicity. Because of this 
homogeneity, analyses of the safety profile of follitropin delta by race and ethnicity have not been carried out. 
Age: The applicant considered that young age is a well-established risk factor for IVF/ICSI patients in 
developing OHSS. Based on the data obtained in the REKOVELLE phase 3 studies, the risk of OHSS is not 
increased among women <35 years compared to those ≥35 years when treated with follitropin delta. The 
incidence of OHSS in women <35 years and ≥35 years, respectively, was 3.6% and 3.3% in ESTHER-1 and 
2.8% and 2.8% for all cycles in the phase 3 trials, when follitropin delta was used for controlled ovarian 
stimulation. In contrast, the data on GONAL-F seem consistent with the literature on young age being a risk 
factor for OHSS, as the incidence of OHSS was 5.6% for women <35 years and 3.7% in women ≥35 years in 
ESTHER-1, and 5.2% and 2.4%, respectively, for all cycles in the phase 3 trials. These findings support the 
appropriateness of the follitropin delta dosing regimen based on AMH and body weight in the 1st cycle and 
subsequently based on ovarian response in the previous cycle.  
Of note, based on literature findings, some parameters (like young age) could be regarded as OHSS risk factors. 
OHSS can also occur despite absence of all risk factors. Applicant conclusion on age related OHSS was not fully 
endorsed. Results on OHSS based on age sub-group analysis are obtained a posteriori (without prior hypothesis) 
and the sub-group sizes were imbalanced. No firm conclusion could be drawn. Regarding the effect of age on 
pregnancy loss, in both treatment groups, the incidence of early pregnancy loss was numerically higher in 
patients aged 35-40 years compared to women younger than 35.  
Extrinsic factors: The potential impact of extrinsic factors (smoking, alcohol habits) on the safety profile of 
follitropin delta had not been analyzed. 
Immunological events 
Introduction: Several factors can influence the immunogenicity of therapeutic proteins, including molecular 
structure, product purity and formulation, duration of treatment and route of administration. Immunogenicity of 
a therapeutic protein is more likely when given intermittently and when administered subcutaneously, and as 
both of these factors may apply to follitropin delta.  
Anti-drug antibodies may affect both the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics profiles of the therapeutic 
proteins. Of particular clinical relevance is the risk of developing neutralizing anti-drug antibodies which could 
potentially reduce the effect of the drug and, in some cases, also the body’s own native proteins. Often, 
however, the immunogenic response is only transient and does not cause biological or clinically relevant 
reactions. Therapeutic drugs made from recombinant human proteins present the immune system with proteins 
which are similar to the body’s own (self-antigens) leading to a very low risk of treatment-induced anti-drug 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 73/95 
  
  
  
antibodies. Nevertheless, repeated exposure to recombinant proteins could lead to a breaking of immune 
tolerance and induction of anti-drug antibody response. 
ESTHER-2 immunogenicity study  
It was a controlled, assessor-blind, parallel group, multicenter, multinational trial evaluating the 
immunogenicity of REKOVELLE in repeated cycles of controlled ovarian stimulation in women undergoing an 
assisted reproductive technology program.  
Subjects having participated in COS cycle 1 (ESTHER-1 study) and having failed to achieve an ongoing 
pregnancy were eligible for participation in COS cycle 2 and 3. The treatment allocation in each repeated cycle 
was identical to the allocation in COS cycle 1. 
The ESTHER-2 trial included 513 patients in COS cycle 2; 252 in FE999049 group and 261 in GONAL-F group. Of 
them, 188 were also treated in COS cycle 3 (95 in FE999049 group and 93 in GONAL-F group).  
Primary Objective:  
To evaluate the immunogenicity of follitropin delta and GONAL-F based on the presence of anti-FSH antibodies 
and their neutralizing capacity in women undergoing repeated controlled ovarian stimulation cycles. 
Secondary Objectives: 
To evaluate the effect of follitropin delta and GONAL-F in repeated controlled ovarian stimulation cycles on 
ovarian response, including follicular development and endocrine profile, as well as on embryo development, 
treatment efficiency and pregnancy rates in the fresh cycles 
To evaluate the safety profile of follitropin delta and GONAL-F, including adverse events, routine safety 
laboratory parameters and local tolerability, in repeated controlled ovarian stimulation cycles 
To evaluate follitropin delta with GONAL-F with respect to cost-effectiveness  
To evaluate follitropin delta in an expanded dose range 
Primary Endpoint: 
Proportion of subjects with treatment-induced anti-FSH antibodies after up to two repeated controlled ovarian 
stimulation cycles 
Secondary Endpoints: 
Included several criteria related to immunogenicity (i.e. proportion of subjects with treatment-induced anti-FSH 
antibodies of neutralizing capacity after up to two repeated controlled ovarian stimulation cycles, proportion of 
subjects with treatment-induced anti-FSH antibodies, overall as well as of neutralizing capacity, after one and 
after two repeated controlled ovarian stimulation cycles). 
Other post-trial Information was also expected from the study ESTHER-2, in particular data regarding live birth 
rate and neonatal health, including minor/major congenital anomalies, at birth and at 4 weeks after birth for 
each fresh controlled ovarian stimulation cycle.  
In each COS cycle (including COS cycle 1 from ESTHER-1), blood samples for analysis of anti-FSH antibodies 
were collected on stimulation day 1 prior to dosing, at 7-10 days after the last IMP dose (1st post-dosing 
assessment) and 21-28 days after the last IMP dose (2nd post-dosing assessment). All blood samples were first 
analyzed in the screening assay: if results indicated absence of anti-FSH antibodies, the samples would be 
classified as negative for anti-FSH antibodies; if results suggested possible presence of anti-FSH antibodies, 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 74/95 
  
  
  
these samples would be further evaluated in the confirmatory assay and only if positive in this assay would be 
classified as positive for anti-FSH antibodies. Positive samples would subsequently be analyzed in an 
immunoassay for quantification of the anti-FSH antibodies; this assay had a titre quantification limit of 0.30 
(titre was expressed as a log10 value and a result of <0.30 means that the titre was not quantifiable). Confirmed 
positive anti-FSH antibody samples would in parallel be assessed for their neutralizing capacity in a cell-based 
assay. 
Figure 9 Tiered Immunogenicity Scheme 
For each cycle, a patient’s anti-FSH antibody status was categorized as one of the following:  
- Negative → negative pre-dosing and post-dosing samples 
- Pre-existing / pre-dosing anti-FSH antibodies → detected in the pre-dosing sample and not developing into a 
treatment-induced response. Of note, “pre-existing” is used for positive pre-dosing samples in ESTHER-1 where 
patients had not yet begun controlled ovarian stimulation; “pre-dosing” is used for positive pre-dosing samples 
in ESTHER-2 as patients here already had been exposed in a previous cycle. 
- Treatment-induced → negative pre-dosing sample and at least one positive post-dosing sample. Of note, the 
definition of treatment-induced anti-FSH antibodies also included the scenario of a ≥2.0 fold (pre-determined 
minimum significant ratio [MSR]) increase in titre from the pre-dosing assessment to a post-dosing assessment 
in patients with a positive pre-dosing sample. This scenario was however not observed. 
Of note, the applicant approach to detect immunogenicity is adequate, in line with the EMA guideline on 
immunogenicity of biotechnology–derived therapeutic proteins (ref EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006). 
Also, the definition of negative, pre–dosing and treatment-induced samples was clear and appropriate. 
Time-points chosen for the analysis of anti-FSH anti bodies post-dosing (days 7–10 and day 21-28) were 
adequate as they allow to detect persistent antibodies.   
Results 
At pre-dosing COS cycle 2, one subject had anti-FSH antibodies of neutralizing capacity at a titre of 1/35. 
Anti-FSH antibodies were detected in the 1st and 2nd post-dosing samples at a log10 titre of 0.47 and 0.53, 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 75/95 
  
  
  
 
 
 
respectively. None of the anti-FSH antibodies observed at post-dosing were of neutralizing capacity. The 
presence of neutralizing antibodies did not appear to compromise the outcome of the treatment efficacy as this 
subject had several oocytes retrieved and ongoing pregnancy further to stimulation in COS cycle 2.The 
proportion of subjects with treatment-induced anti-FSH antibodies (primary end-point) was 0.79% (2/252, 95% 
CI [0.10%; 2.84%]) in the REKOVELLE group and 0.38% (1/261, 95% CI [0.01%; 2.12%]) in the GONAL-F 
group.  
None of the treatment-induced anti-FSH antibodies observed in COS cycle 2 or in COS cycle 3 were of 
neutralizing capacity at any sampling time point (secondary endpoint).  
Regarding quantification of anti-FSH antibodies, In REKOVELLE group, comparison of (positive) samples 
between pre-dosing samples and treatment-induces samples with regard to anti-FSH antibodies does not show 
an increase in the titres as most of them remain under the limit of detection (<0.30).  
In summary, immunogenicity was investigated in the two clinical phase 3 studies. The safety study ESTHER-2 
explored this aspect (primary objective) in comparison with other follitropin (GONAL-F). From the results, 
immunogenicity was low and the immunologic reaction to REKOVELLE expressed by the presence of anti-FSH 
antibodies appeared to be transient, without clinically relevant consequences. This was based on the following 
observations. Treatment–induced anti-FSH antibodies did not appear to compromise the ovarian stimulation as 
all the three patients who developed antibodies had several oocytes retrieved in COS cycle 2 and had blastocyst 
transfer. None of them had cycle cancellation. Anti-FSH antibodies with neutralizing capacity was detected in 
one subject in REKOVELLE group (positive sample with neutralizing capacity at pre-dosing stage). The subject 
had several oocytes retrieved and ongoing pregnancy further to COS cycle 2. The general safety profile and local 
tolerability of gonadotropin injections did not appear to be different in patients with anti-FSH antibodies, 
whether they were positive at pre-dosing or “treatment- induced”, compared to those patients FSH where 
antibodies were not detected. Also, there was no increase in proportion of subjects with treatment-induced anti 
FSH antibodies after repeated exposure to REKOVELLE. Based on the submitted data, REKOVELLE appeared to 
have limited immunogenicity with no relevant clinical impact. However, based on the EMA Guideline on 
immunogenicity assessment of biotechnology-derived therapeutic proteins (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006), 
immunogenicity might occur at a level which will not be detected at a pre-approval stage due to the restricted 
number of patients available. Thus, it was considered necessary to continue assessment of unwanted 
immunogenicity (enhanced reporting of related AEs, minimization measures) and its clinical consequences 
post-approval. Immunogenicity was included as a potential risk in the RMP. Of note, as mentioned in a previous 
part of the report (PK), generally, the bio analytical methods used for the determination of anti-FSH antibodies 
appear adequate and comply with acceptance criteria regarding selectivity, sensitivity accuracy and precision. 
Furthermore, the anti-FSH antibody bio analytical methods and the neutralizing antibody assay were robust and 
precise and appear to be adequately validated throughout the clinical trials. Regarding immune-related adverse 
events, there was no anaphylactic reaction or severe immune-related AEs reported in the phase III studies in 
any treatment group. The number of local immune-related AEs having reasonable possible causality with the 
stimulation treatments appears limited with regard to the type of product (protein) and the sub cutaneous route 
of administration ; under REKOVELLE, 1 patient under had rash of middle intensity and 1 patient had chills of 
moderate intensity. Under GONAL-F1 patient had rash of moderate intensity. During the second round of this 
procedure, the Applicant documented the method used to capture/search immune-related adverse events. No 
new local immune-related AEs were revealed. 
Injection site reactions (local tolerability): During the stimulation period in ESTHER 1 and ESTHER 2 trials, 
the injection site reactions were self-assessed by the patients 30 min and 24 hours after each administration in 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 76/95 
  
  
  
both treatment groups. Graduation of intensity (none, mild, moderate, severe) was performed for all the 
concerned injection site reactions (redness, itching, pain, swelling, bruising). 
Proportion of patients who reported any injection site reaction was comparable between the two treatment 
groups in each of the three COS cycles. Redness, itching and pain were more common immediately after 
administration of follitropin delta or GONAL F while swelling was most common 30 min after administration and 
bruising most common after 24h. To minimize local injection site reactions, it was advised to change injection 
site regularly.  
From the results, the percentage of patients with any injection site reaction was comparable between 
REKOVELLE group and GONAL-F (about 31% in COS cycle 1) with increasing incidence across the COS cycles. 
The pattern of injection site reactions was not more favourable with REKOVELLE compared to the one of 
GONAL-F. There was no apparent benefit on this issue.  
Regarding medication errors, in COS cycle 1, incorrect dose was administered more frequently with 
REKOVELLE (12 cases) vs GONAL-F (5 cases). The Applicant attributed this difference to the limited experience 
of the sites and patients in using an investigational product with a different dosing regimen and a new pen 
compared to using a marketed product. Of note, unlikely to GONAL-F, the dose REKOVELLE is calculated using 
micrograms while the International Unit (IU) is more currently used for such type of products. In case of 
approval, administration of incorrect dose of REKOVELLE (follitropin delta), notably due to the use of 
micrograms instead of IU, is not to be excluded. At day 120 of the procedure, the Applicant was asked to discuss 
the impact of the potential medication errors (incorrect dose) as well as the clinical consequences (i.e. loss of 
efficacy, enhanced AEs). From the response provided, it was apparent that there were issues with regards the 
use of the pen with the wrong dose of FE990049 being administered resulting in major protocol deviations in 6 
instances. However the applicant has not put forward any proposal for managing the risks which could arise from 
improper or incorrect use of the pen. In addition, the applicant considered that the risk of medication errors 
caused by incorrect interpretation of the dosing unit to be hypothetical and not likely as a result no proposal is 
put forward to manage this risk.  At day 150 of the procedure, the Applicant clarified that medication error 
related to incorrect use of the pen will be captured, monitored and reported during postmarketing surveillance 
both in the applicant’s Pharmacovigilance system (medication error) and in the applicant’s medical device 
vigilance system (malfunction or use error of REKOVELLE pen). This was agreed and reflected in PRAC 
Rapporteur AR. Also, the Instruction for use was provided in a final revised layout which was more user-friendly. 
There were 14 events of pen malfunctions reported with REKOVELLE while no event was reported with 
GONAL-F. Of the 14 events, 9 were considered as human errors attributed to “inadequate instructions” or 
“possible misunderstanding” of the instructions.  
Of note, during the second round of the procedure, the Applicant revised the separate “Instructions for use” 
(related to the pen) and modified the SmPC and PIL cross references to these instructions. There were no 
statistically significant differences in the overall abdominal discomfort indicated by VAS scores between 
REKOVELLE and GONAL-F either at end-of-stimulation or at blastocyst transfer in ESTHER-1. 
There was no important change in body weight or in abdominal circumference observed from baseline to 
end of stimulation, or from baseline to transfer visit in any of the treatment groups. Only interim Neonatal 
health data is available for 386 neonates. Of them, 226 are offspring from patients treated with REKOVELLE and 
160 from patients treated with GONAL-F. Regarding cryopreserved blastocyst, neonatal data at birth is available 
for 47 neonates (group REKOVELLE) and 33 neonates (group GONAL-F).

Admission to NICU/NCU at Birth and Hospitalization within 4 Weeks after Birth (Interim Data): Based on all data 
available from phase 2 and 3 trials, admission of a live-born neonate to NICU/NCU at birth occurred at an 
incidence of 8.5% (19/224) in the follitropin delta group and 8.8% (14/159) in the GONAL-F group, with the 
most common reason being prematurity. Additional hospitalizations of neonates within 4 weeks after birth were 
reported for 3.1% (4/130) and 3.2% (4/126) in the follitropin delta and GONAL-F groups, respectively. 
Based on the data available from the cryopreserved cycles using blastocysts from the completed phase 2 and 3 
trials, admission of a live-born neonate to NICU/NCU at birth occurred at an incidence of 8.5% (4/47) in the 
follitropin delta group and 18.2% (6/33) in the GONAL-F group, and additional admissions within 4 weeks 
occurred for 11.1% (3/27) of the neonates in the follitropin delta group and 0% (0/28) of the neonates in the 
GONAL-F group. 
Congenital Anomalies (Interim Data): Congenital anomalies were classified as or major or minor using the 
following definitions: 
Major → a life threatening structural anomaly or one likely to cause significant impairment of health or functional 
capacity and which needs medical or surgical treatment  
Minor → relatively frequent structural anomaly not likely to cause any medical or cosmetic problems  
Major congenital anomalies in live-born neonates have been reported at an incidence of 1.8% (5/271) and 2.1% 
(4/192) for follitropin delta and GONAL-F, respectively. In addition, major congenital anomalies in fetuses have 
been detected in 3 pregnancies in the follitropin delta group and 5 pregnancies in the GONAL-F group, of which 
3 and 4, respectively, led to elective termination of the pregnancy.  
The interim data on minor congenital anomalies in live-born neonates after controlled ovarian stimulation cycles 
and cryopreserved cycles in the completed phase 2 and 3 trials yield an incidence of 3.3% (9/271) in the 
follitropin delta group and 1.6% (3/192)  in the GONAL-F group.  
In summary, although limited, available data did not suggest a difference in the pregnancy outcome (including 
neonatal data) between REKOVELLE and GONAL-F after fresh cycles. No new concern was observed from 
available data. Admission to neonatal care unit was reported with a similar incidence in both groups (8.5 % and 
8.8%), mainly for prematurity. Full data about neonatal health after fresh cycles was submitted at day 120 of 
the procedure and data did not reveal a new special concern. Full data about neonatal health (and pregnancy 
follow-up) from cryopreserved cycles will be submitted in the post-authorization phase.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted for REKOVELLE. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The trial period extend beyond the duration of exposure to the stimulation treatment. Therefore, adverse events 
leading to discontinuation covered not only those occurring during stimulation and leading to stop of treatment 
but also those occurring after completed controlled ovarian stimulation with follitropin delta / GONAL-F leading 
to discontinuation from subsequent visits/activities in the trial. In the phase 3 studies, adverse events leading to 
discontinuation occurred for 15 patients (1.5%) in the follitropin delta group and 14 patients (1.4%) in the 
GONAL-F group. None of them led to premature stop of the treatment; rather all AEs occurred after completed 
controlled ovarian stimulation and led mainly to cancellation of blastocyst transfer or less frequently to 
cancellation of triggering of final follicular maturation. OHSS was the most frequent AE leading to cancellation of

blastocyst transfer occurring for 7 patients (0.7%) and 9 patients (0.9%) in the REKOVELLE and GONAL-F 
groups, respectively. Additionally 1 patient in the GONAL-F group had transfer cancelled due to ovarian 
hyperfunction.  
In summary, apart from OHSS, other adverse events leading to discontinuation were sporadic in both treatment 
groups. The rate of discontinuation was generally low in both treatment groups.

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
REKOVELLE (follitropin delta or FE999049) is a human recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) 
belonging to the pharmacotherapeutic class of gonadotropins.  
A total of 1,769 subjects have been included in the seven completed clinical trials that contributed to the safety 
database. Of them, 995 subjects were exposed to REKOVELLE; 108 patients within the phase I trial, 222 
patients within the phase II trial and 665 within the phase III clinical trial ESTHER-1 where the starting dose was 
individualized based on AMH level and women bodyweight. This dosing regimen used in the phase 3 study is 
reflected in the agreed SmPC. At the end of ESTHER 1, patients who failed to achieve pregnancy (252 in 
REKOVELLE group) underwent a second ovarian stimulation cycle within the study ESTHER 2. Those who failed 
to achieve pregnancy after this second stimulation cycle (95 under REKOVELLE) underwent a third stimulation 
cycle which was part of the study ESTHER-2.  
In the phase 3 studies, the follitropin delta was compared to another gonadotropin (follitropin alfa).  
Among the 1,012 COS cycles for IVF/ICSI conducted with REKOVELLE in the phase 3 program, 42% used a daily 
dose of <12 μg and 58% used a daily dose of ≥12 μg. The mean duration of exposure to REKOVELLE was 8.9 
days and the mean total dose was 90 µg. 
Regarding the study population, the demographic profile and baseline characteristics were similar in 
REKOVELLE and GONAL-F groups. Patients included were on average 33 years of age, with 61% being younger 
than 35 years and 39% being 35 years or older. The majority (95%) of the women in the completed phase 2 and 
3 trials were Caucasians and of non-Hispanic/non-Latino ethnicity. 
Regarding adverse drug reactions (ADRs), in the study ESTHER-1, the proportion of subjects with any ADR 
appeared higher with REKOVELLE (17%) compared to GONAL-F (13.8%). Headache, pelvic discomfort, OHSS, 
pelvic pain and adnexa uteri pain were the ADR the most frequently reported with REKOVELLE. Their incidence 
of all ADRs decreased across the cycles. Regarding the dose effect, when we compare the incidence of ADRs in 
two dose groups (daily dose below 12µg versus above 12 µg), we observe no marked change with increasing 
dose.  
No deaths have been reported in subjects participating to the clinical programme. Regarding serious adverse 
events (SAE), data obtained in ESTHER–1 and ESTHER–2 (combined) showed that proportion of patients 
reporting any SAE was comparable between the two groups (2% with REKOVELLE and 1.5% with GONAL-F). 
Most of the cases did not have a reasonable causality relationship with the investigated medicinal products. 
Serious OHSS (SAE related to the IMP) occurred in 3 patients under REVOKELLE and 8 patients under GONAL-F. 
Duration of hospitalisation was more important in GONAL-f patients (mean duration 8 days) compared with 
REKOVELLE (4 days). The other SAE were related to various pregnancy complications such as; haemorrhage in 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 79/95 
  
  
  
pregnancy (6 cases with REKOVELLE and 2 with GONAL-F, all assessed with no reasonable causal relationship to 
IMP), abortion spontaneous (3 cases with REKOVELLE and 1 with GONAL-F), biochemical pregnancy (1 with 
REKOVELLE, 2 with GONAL-F) vomiting in pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy (1 case with REKOVELLE and 2 with 
GONAL-F). Adnexal torsion (ovarian torsion), with no association to OHSS, occurred in a single patient exposed 
to REKOVELLE and recovered after surgery. The investigator assessed the causal relationship to IMP as no 
reasonable possibility.There was no apparent effect of REKOVELLE dose on the proportion of patients reporting 
SAE. 
Ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome (OHSS) was an adverse event of interest given the therapeutic class. 
OHSS’ preventive interventions included i) the use GnRH agonist (for triggering of final follicular maturation), ii) 
administration of dopamine agonist. Both approaches corresponded to an off-label use. Cycle cancellation was 
also used to prevent early OHSS. 
In the development program, difference was made between early OHSS (preventable) and late OHSS (more of 
concern). Based on the Applicant rationale, the individualized dosing regimen with REKOVELLE (upon AMH level 
and body weight) was supposed to produce an adequate ovarian stimulation response and to limit cases of 
OHSS. From ESTHER-1 results, although number of total OHSS cases (early and late) was numerically lower 
with REKOVELLE compared to GONAL-F, the difference was not statistically significant; incidence was 3.5% with 
REKOVELLE and 4.8% with GONAL-F, p=0.238 (despite the individualized dosing regimen). Also, late OHSS was 
more frequent with GONAL-F (1.8%) compared to REKOVELLE (0.9%) but the difference was not statistically 
significant (p=0.320). However, a statistically significant decrease in “preventive interventions for early OHSS” 
was observed with REKOVELLE; indeed, proportion of patients needing such interventions was 2.3% with 
REKOVELLE and 4.5% with GONAL-F, p = 0.005.  
Regarding early pregnancy loss, among patients with a positive βhCG test in the controlled ovarian 
stimulation cycle, the rate of early pregnancy loss was comparable between the two groups in study ESTHER 1. 
The rates of early pregnancy loss in the two groups across the COS cycles (ESTHER 1 and ESTHER 2) were:  20.6 
% and 21.4 % in COS cycle 1, 26% and 23% in COS cycle 2, 35% and 23 % in COS cycle 3 for follitropine delta 
and GONAL-F respectively. Given the decreasing total number of patients treated across the cycles, a direct 
comparison between the rates could not be made. Interim data available from cryopreserved cycles using 
blastocysts from ESTHER 1 and ESTHER 2 was comparable with results obtained from fresh cycles. Interim data 
on late pregnancy loss did not suggest a difference between the two groups. The rates of multiple 
pregnancies (twins) were 5.7% % and 6.6% with REKOVELLE and GONAL-F respectively. There was no higher 
order pregnancies in any of the treatment groups. 
Immunogenicity was investigated in the phase 3 studies and assessed in the safety study ESTHER 2 (main 
objective) in comparison with GONAL-F. Presence of treatment induced anti-FSH antibodies and their 
neutralizing capacity were compared between the groups. The approach used in the studies to assess 
immunogenicity (screening assay on blood samples before treatment, confirmatory assay, immunoassay for 
quantification of the anti-FSH antibodies and assessment of neutralizing capacity) was in line with the EMA 
Guideline on immunogenicity assessment of biotechnology-derived therapeutic proteins 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006). Time-points chosen for the analysis of anti-FSH anti bodies post-dosing 
(days 7–10 and day 21-28) were adequate as they allow to detect persistent antibodies.  
From the results, the number of patients with treatment-induced anti-FSH antibodies in ESTHER 2 was limited 
in the two treatment groups (2 patients with REKOVELLE (0.79%) and 1 patient with GONAL-F (0.38%)). None 
of them had antibodies with neutralizing capacity and all antibody titres were very low. Also, subjects with 
treatment-induced anti-FSH antibodies did not experience an affected ovarian response or enhanced ADRs.   
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 80/95 
  
  
  
Of note, at pre-dosing phase in ESTHER 2 COS cycle 2 (REKOVELLE group), one subject had anti-FSH antibodies 
of neutralizing capacity at a titre of 1/35. In this patient, the presence of neutralizing antibodies did not appear 
to compromise the outcome of the treatment efficacy as the subject had several oocytes retrieved and an 
ongoing pregnancy further to stimulation in COS cycle 2.  
The number of local immune-related AEs having reasonable possible causality with the stimulation 
treatments was limited with regard to the type of product (protein) and the route of administration 
(subcutaneous injections). During the second round of the procedure, the Applicant submitted additional data 
about the relevance of the method used to capture the immune-related AEs (covering all the immune-related AE 
terms) and about the relevance of the causality assessment. Anaphylactic reactions or severe cutaneous 
adverse reactions were not reported in any treatment group. Proportion of patients who reported any injection 
site reaction was comparable between the two treatment groups in each of the three COS cycles.  
The percentage of patients with any injection site reaction was comparable between REKOVELLE group and 
GONAL-F (about 31% in COS cycle 1) with increasing incidence across the COS cycles. The pattern of injection 
site reactions was not more favourable with REKOVELLE compared to the one of GONAL-F. There was no 
apparent benefit on this issue.  
Medication errors corresponding to administration of incorrect dose occurred more frequently with 
REKOVELLE vs GONAL-F. The Applicant attributed this difference to the limited experience of the sites and 
patients in using an investigational product with a different dosing regimen and a new pen compared to using a 
marketed product. No additional risk minimisation measures were suggested to reduce the risk of dosing errors. 
But any medication error report related to incorrect use of REKOVELLE pen will be captured, monitored and 
reported during post-marketing surveillance both in the applicant’s pharmacovigilance system (medication 
error) and in the applicant’s medical device vigilance system (malfunction or use error of REKOVELLE pen). This 
was agreed. 
Cases of pen malfunctions occurred also more frequently with REKOVELLE. Instructions for use related to the 
pen were revised by the Applicant during the second round of the procedure.  
Regarding pregnancy outcome and neonatal health, cases of stillbirth, neonatal death and congenital 
anomalies were limited and comparable between the two groups. Full report covering pregnancy outcome and 
neonatal health (obtained from fresh cycle) was submitted during the second round of the procedure and no new 
issue was highlighted. Full data from cryopreserved cycle will be submitted post-authorization.  
Discontinuations related to AE were generally low in both groups (1.5% and 1.4%). OHSS led to 
discontinuation of 7 patients in REKOVELLE group and 9 patients in GONAL-F group.  
In terms of special populations, there is no data available even though FE 999049 is thought to be 
metabolised in the kidney. There was a possibility therefore that elimination of FE 999049 might be impaired in 
patients with renal insufficiency. No data were available regarding the use in patients with moderate to severe 
hepatic impairment. Warnings were added to section 4.4 of the SmPC for REKOVELLE indicating that follitropin 
delta has not been studied in patients with moderate/severe renal or hepatic impairment. Of note, from the PK 
data available, mild hepatic or renal impairment did not appear to have an effect on REKOVELLE.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the Summary 
of Product Characteristics.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Based on the submitted data, the safety profile of REKOVELLE (Follitropin delta) was generally acceptable and 
similar to the safety profile of GONAL-F. No new safety concern was raised from the clinical studies.  
Results obtained from ESTHER 2 study showed that REKOVELLLE has limited immunogenicity with no clinical 
relevance. Patients who presented treatment-induced anti-FSH antibodies (two with REKOVELLE) didn’t have an 
affected ovarian response. Only one patient had anti-FSH antibodies with neutralizing capacity (at pre-dosing 
stage of COS 2) but a clinical relevant impact was not observed as this patient had several oocytes retrieved and 
ongoing pregnancy.  
According to the Applicant’s rationale, the individualized dosing regimen with REKOVELLE (based on AMH and 
bodyweight) was supposed to produce an adequate ovarian stimulation response and to limit the rate of patients 
presenting OHSS. From ESTHER-1 results, cases of total OHSS occurred in 3.5% of patients with REKOVELLE 
and 4.8% with GONAL-F but statistical difference was not reached between the two groups (p=0.238). Only a 
significant decrease in “OHSS’ preventive interventions” was observed with REKOVELLE (2.3%) compared to 
GONAL-F (4.5%), p = 0.005. Of note, only early OHSS are preventable. Late forms of OHSS are usually more of 
concern. Proportion of late OHSS was lower with REKOVELLE (0.9%) compared to GONAL-F (1.8%) but here 
also, this difference was not statistically significant (p=0.320). Overall, a firm conclusion about a different OHSS 
profile between the two groups cannot be drawn.  
In addition, the Applicant agreed (REC) to provide full data on pregnancy follow up including pregnancy loss and 
neonatal health (stillbirth, neonatal death, admission to NICU/NCU and congenital anomalies) after 
cryopreserved cycles of ESTHER 1 and ESTHER 2 studies in the post-authorization phase. Discussion of the 
obtained data should be provided by the Applicant including the comparison of outcome between follitropin delta 
and follitropin alfa. This measure is aimed to assess if the pregnancy outcome and neonatal health further to 
treatment with REKOVELLE has additional safety concern, compared to current follitropin alfa.

2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that follitropin delta has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the 
European Union. 
Based on the available quality, non-clinical and clinical data, the CHMP considers, that follitropin delta, which 
have some differences in molecular structure, nature of the source material or manufacturing process, does not 
differ significantly in properties with regard to safety and/or efficacy from follitropin alfa and follitropin beta 
contained in medicinal products previously authorised within the European Union and therefore is not considered 
to be a NAS. 
The Applicant has provided the following justification in support of new active substance (NAS): 
FE 999049 fulfils the definition of a new active substance according to the Note to Applicants, Volume 2A chapter 
I, Annex I as:    
The FE 999049 drug substance is not previously authorised as a medicinal product in the European Union. 
• 
The  glycosylation  profile  of  FE  999049  is  different  from  existing  recombinant  follicle  stimulating 
hormone products manufactured from Chinese hamster ovary cell lines  
• 
Clinical relevant difference in safety to follitropin alfa is demonstrated in the phase 3 programme for 
ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome risk management and lower gonadotropin consumption. 
The CHMP considered the following with regards to the new active substance claim: 
Quality aspects 
The Applicant demonstrated that the amino acid sequence of follitropin delta (FE 999049) is identical to the 
endogenous human FSH sequence for both α and β subunits, and to that of existing CHO-derived recombinant 
FSH products. As expected, since, the glycosylation profile of recombinant proteins is dependent on the 
expressing cell line and the cell culture conditions, the glycosylation profiles of FE 999049 and CHO-derived rFSH 
products are different. FE 999049 contains both α2,3 and α2,6 sialylation patterns, while CHO-derived rFSH 
products exclusively carry 2,3 linked sialic acid. However, the differences in glycosylation pattern have no 
impact on relative potency, measured by the in vitro cell-based assay. 
In general, differences in glycosylation profile could only be considered relevant for NAS status, if associated 
with a primary mode of action and a given function related to the indication. This is not the case for FSH 
mechanism of action, as there is no impact on potency. Nevertheless, the differences in glycosylation profile 
might be considered relevant in terms of safety and/or efficacy when assessed at the non-clinical and clinical 
levels. 
Non-clinical aspects 
FE999049 is a glycoprotein produced on PER.C6® cells, which is composed of two non-covalently bound 
polypeptide chains, denoted alfa (α) and beta (β). The amino acid sequence of FE999049 is identical to purified 
follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and to that of existing CHO derived recombinant follicle-stimulating hormone 
(rFSH) products. Currently approved rFSH products are derived from Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell lines. 
CHO cells are not capable of sialylating glycoproteins in the α2,6 position, opposite to cells from human origin 
like HEK293 and PER.C6 cells. As FE999049 is a recombinant human FSH expressed in a host cell line of human 
origin (PER.C6), FE999049 contains both α2,3 and α2,6 sialylation patterns, while CHO-derived rFSH products 
exclusively carry α2,3 linked sialic acid.  
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 85/95 
  
  
  
Since the pharmacology of FSH is well known, only a few studies elucidating the primary effects of FE999049 
have been performed. In vitro results comparing FE999049 to Gonal-F in receptor binding, activation of 
luteinised granulosa cells and activation of the human receptor in HEK 293 cells have not shown any differences 
between Gonal-F and FE999049 in terms of potency, suggesting that the differences of glycosylation profiles 
between the two products have no specific impact on FSH receptor activation.  
In conclusion, based on non-clinical data, showing similar primary pharmacology profiles between follitropin alfa 
(Gonal-F) and follitropin delta (FE999049), the CHMP considered that FE999049 is not to be qualified as a new 
active substance. 
Clinical aspects 
Pharmacokinetics 
Comparison of the clearance between follitropin delta and Gonal-F (follitropin alfa) over trials (single SC and IV 
administrations) consistently demonstrated a significant lower clearance with follitropin delta that with Gonal-F, 
resulting in a higher exposure (1.4 to to 1.7-fold higher for Cmax and AUC) when dosed at the same bioactivity. 
Accordingly, T1/2 of follitropin delta was longer than T1/2 of Gonal-F across studies: the T1/2 of follitropin delta 
was 28 hours compared to 18 hours for Gonal-F. This could be expected since glycosylation profile of follitropin 
delta is significantly higher than in CHO-derived rFSH and is characterized by higher proportion of 
tetra-antennary structures and higher overall sialic acid content. Glycosylation is known to be associated with 
decreased metabolic clearance. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The mode of action of follitropin delta is identical to the one of follitropin alfa. When dosed at the same 
bioactivity, follitropin delta shows a more profound stimulation of ovulation but it is supposed to be linked to the 
decreased metabolic clearance compared to follitropin alfa.  
Efficacy 
In the pivotal phase III efficacy trial, follitropin delta did not show a better efficacy compared to Gonal-F in terms 
of ongoing pregnancy rate after COS followed by IVF or ICSI. Although a more uniform ovarian response was 
observed with follitropin delta, it was not translated into a better pregnancy rate, and even a lower pregnancy 
rate was observed in women aged 37 years and less. In addition, no additional benefits in terms of risk of cycle 
cancellations due to poor ovarian response were obtained with follitropin delta versus Gonal-F. After first round 
of assessment, the Applicant was requested to provide rational to justify in what the efficacy would be different 
between Rekovelle and Gonal F (follitropin alfa) or Puregon (follitropin beta) since the mode of action of 
follitropin delta was identical. In the clinical development, efficacy and safety outcomes observed with 
follitropine delta (Rekovelle) were compared to follitropine alpha (Gonal - F) in a non-inferiority design and 
results did not show new finding compared to the state of knowledge. From efficacy point of view the data 
submitted did not allow to consider follitropine delta as a new active substance. 
Safety 
The safety profile of REKOVELLE (follitropin delta) was generally acceptable and similar to the safety profile of 
GONAL-F. No new safety concern was raised from the clinical studies. Limited immunogenicity was observed 
with REKOVELLE, with no clinical relevance. Results were comparable to those observed with GONAL-F. Number 
of patients with treatment-induced anti-FSH antibodies was limited in the two treatment groups in Esther-1 
study and anti-FSH neutralizing antibodies were observed in one patient with REKOVELLE at pre-dosing stage. 
According to the applicant rationale, the individualized dosing regimen with REKOVELLE (based on AMH and 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 86/95 
  
  
  
bodyweight) is supposed to produce an adequate ovarian stimulation response and to limit the rate of patients 
presenting OHSS. Incidence of total OHSS was 3.5% of patients with REKOVELLE and 4.8% with GONAL-F but 
statistical difference was not reached between the two groups (p=0.238). From the results, a difference in the 
OHSS profile between REKOVELLE and GONAL-F the two groups was not concluded. From safety point of view 
the data submitted did not allow to consider follitropine delta as a new active substance. 
Conclusions 
The differences in the production cell line, manufacturing process (and site of manufacture) are acknowledged. 
However, follitropin alfa and follitropin delta have the same amino acid sequence. Post translational structural 
differences that exist between follitropin alfa and follitropin delta do not have an impact on potency. It is 
concluded that follitropin delta (Rekovelle) is a known active substance from a quality perspective. 
From an efficacy and safety point of view, it could not be concluded that the products are different since the 
mechanism of action between follitropin delta is identical to the one of follitropin alfa and beta, and efficacy and 
safety outcomes observed with follitropin delta (Rekovelle) were compared to follitropin alpha (Gonal - F) in a 
non-inferiority design did not show new finding compared to the state of knowledge.  
Based on the review of the data the CHMP considers that the active substance follitropin delta contained in the 
medicinal product Rekovelle is not to be qualified as a NAS in itself. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the applicant 
show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the readability of 
the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Rekovelle (follitropin delta) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it is a biological product and authorised after 1 January 2011.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
This recombinant gonadrotropin is intended to induce controlled ovarian stimulation for the development of 
multiple follicles in women undergoing assisted reproductive technologies (ART) when suffering of infertility.  
The definition of infertility may differ in different parts of the world, but in Europe the World Health Organisation 
(WHO) definition is generally accepted: ‘Infertility is a disease of the reproductive system defined by the failure 
to achieve a clinical pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse”. 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 87/95 
  
  
  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) with gonadotropins aim to obtain an adequate number of competent 
oocytes to be used for ART procedures such as In Vitro Fertilisation (IVF)/IntraCytoplasmic Sperm Injection 
(ICSI) with minimum risks for the woman. 
Females of infertile couples undergoing COS were treated with recombinant or urinary follicle stimulating 
hormone (FSH) and human menotropin gonadotropin (hMG) to induce multiple follicle development to obtain a 
number of oocytes, preferably 8 to 14. If the cause of infertility is related to abnormal sperm production or 
function (male factor), the oocytes are usually fertilised by ICSI and if the cause of infertility is strictly related to 
female factors, oocytes may be fertilised by conventional IVF. Even though the outcome rates with each 
technique are comparable, the most common fertilisation technique is ICSI. Overall, ICSI accounts for around 
two-thirds of all treatments worldwide, and conventional IVF around one-third. However, these proportions vary 
greatly between countries. 
In Europe, several follitropin-containing products are available with an indication in the controlled ovarian 
stimulation for the development of multiple follicles in women undergoing ART.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
One pivotal randomised controlled Phase 3 study (ESTHER-1) was conducted in 1326 patients to document the 
efficacy of follitropin delta in the stimulation of multifollicular development followed by IVF or ICSI in women. 
The active comparator, follitropin alfa, was chosen as a control group. COS was applied in a GnRH antagonist 
protocol and IVF or ICSI were performed on fresh cycles after oocytes retrieval. The two co-primary endpoints 
were  ongoing  pregnancy  rate  and  ongoing  implantation  rate  in  the  fresh  cycle,  defined  as  at  least  one 
intrauterine viable fetus 10-11 weeks after transfer and number of intrauterine viable fetuses 10-11 weeks after 
transfer divided by number of blastocysts transferred, respectively.  
Achieving pregnancy and live birth 
The ongoing pregnancy rate in the PP population was 31.8% with FE 999049 and 32.6% with GONAL-F, with 
a 95% CI for the difference of -6.0% to 4.3%. For the mITT population, the ongoing pregnancy rate was 30.7% 
with FE 999049 and 31.6% with GONAL-F, with a 95% CI for the difference of -5.9% to 4.1%. The lower bound 
of the 95% CI was above the pre-specified non-inferiority limit of -8.0%.  
The  ongoing  implantation  rate  in  the  PP  population  was  36.2%  with  follitropin  delta  and  36.9%  with 
GONAL-F, with a 95% CI for the difference of -6.5% to 4.7%. For the mITT population, the ongoing implantation 
rate was 35.2% with follitropin delta and 35.8% with GONAL-F, with a 95% CI for the difference of -6.1% to 
4.8%. For both analysis populations, the lower bound of the 95% CI was above the pre-specified non-inferiority 
limit of -8.0 %. Thus, non-inferiority of follitropin delta to GONAL-F with respect to ongoing pregnancy rate and 
ongoing implantation rate was demonstrated for both the PP and mITT populations. 
However, there were imbalanced results when considering subgroup analysis based on age and AMH level (see 
below).   
Based on the pregnancy outcome data available, the interim live birth rate was 31.0% (114/368) with follitropin 
delta and 29.6% (110/371) with GONAL-F. 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 88/95 
  
  
  
Pregnancies were also obtained after a second or a third COS cycle in the supportive phase 3 trial ESTHER-2 (in 
COS cycle 2, the ongoing pregnancy rate was 27.8% and in COS cycle 3, the ongoing pregnancy rate was 27.4% 
in the follitropin delta group). Live birth rate according to interim data was 26.5% (COS cycle 2) and 18.2% 
(COS cycle 3) in the follitropin delta group. 
Interim  data  on  pregnancies  from  cryopreserved  blastocysts  obtained  in  ESTHER-1  and  ESTHER-2  show  an 
ongoing pregnancy rate of 30.8% and ongoing implantation rate of 27.5% in the follitropin delta group. 
Individualized dosing regimen 
Although a more uniform ovarian response was observed with follitropin delta, it did not translate into a better 
pregnancy rate, and even a lower pregnancy rate was observed in women aged 37 years and less. No additional 
benefits in terms of risk of cycle cancellation due to poor ovarian response were obtained with follitropin delta as 
compared to follitropin alfa. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The heterogeneity of responses in some subgroups was observed in Esther-1.  
It seemed that the treatment effect is quite different depending on whether women are below or over 38 
years old. For the ongoing pregnancy rate, although the maximum difference observed in the overall 
population was below the non-inferiority limit of – 8% (95% CI lower limit of - 6%), in the subgroup of women 
aged 37 years and less (85% of the population) the difference between groups is equal to -3.1%, jeopardizing 
the non-inferiority. On the contrary, in the subgroup of women aged 38-40 years (15% of the population), the 
difference between groups was equal to +11.3%, making the non-inferiority easily reached. Similar observation 
was done for the ongoing implantation rate. Women younger than 38 years represented the very large majority 
of patients included in the pivotal trial as well as all subjects included in phase 2 dose-finding trial. The analysis 
of the distribution of ongoing pregnancy and implantation rates across 1 year age strata from 25 to 40 year old 
demonstrated that there is no clear trend of decreasing efficacy as subjects get younger. 
The results of both primary endpoints in the low AMH stratum (<15 pmol/L) were suggestive of a numerical 
imbalance in ESTHER-1. The ongoing pregnancy rate obtained was 29% for follitropin delta in comparison to 
33% in the GONAL-F group and 34% in the high AMH stratum (>= 15 pmol/L) while ongoing implantation rate 
in the low AMH stratum was 32.9% for follitropin delta and 36.8% in the GONAL-F group for PP set. However it 
was acknowledged that the observed pregnancy and implantation rate were similar to the expected 
pregnancy/implantation rates. Taking into consideration also that the ESTHER-1 trial was not powered or 
designed to demonstrate non-inferiority within subgroups it was agreed that the results could be due to random 
variation rather than a reduced efficacy of FE 999049 when compared to Gonal-F. 
The clinical relevance of the non-inferiority limit was questioned. The ENGAGE study (with corifollitropin alfa), 
upon which the non-inferiority margin was based, provided a confidence interval lower bound of -4% for the 
ongoing pregnancy rate, which was higher than the non-inferiority margin of -8% and which could even 
guarantee a loss of efficacy less than 5%. The required sample size for the formal demonstration of -5% 
non-inferiority would have been more significant (2800 patients), but trials of such size are not that uncommon, 
and the size of the trial should always fit any relevant clinical objective. Regarding the phase 2 trial, there were 
some hints that the non-inferiority would be challenging for the ongoing pregnancy endpoint with the chosen 
non-inferiority margin. Without considering the full magnitude of the negative response observed in the phase 
2 trial (which would require a tremendous amount of patients), it would have been wiser to consider a small loss 
EMA/11072/2017 
Page 89/95 
  
  
  
 
of efficacy in the sample size calculation of the pivotal study. This unanticipated loss of efficacy led, to some 
extent, to under power the phase 3 trial for the main subgroup of subjects ≤ 38 year. 
Rationale for the proposed dosing adjustment scheme for further cycles after COS cycle 1 (ESTHER-2) 
was provided. Overall the ongoing pregnancy rates in COS cycle 2 and COS cycle 3 were lower compared to COS 
cycle 1. It was difficult to establish the benefit/risk ratio for doses of follitropin delta superior to 12 µg per 
day. Indeed, only few women have been treated with doses superior to 12 µg per day in the ESTHER-2 trial, in 
particular very few women have been treated with doses superior to 18 µg per day (5 women have received 
femmes a dose of 24 µg per day, 45 women have received a dose between 18 and 24 µg per day, 180 women 
have received a dose between 12 and 18 µg). No conclusion could be made on efficacy of follitropin delta at 
doses above 12 µg per day, as efficacy endpoints were exploratory in ESTHER-2. And no dose-response 
relationship was established in the phase 2 PD trial in terms of chance of pregnancy. The Applicant explained 
that this was not based on modelling or estimation and rather it was derived using clinical practice as a guide. 
This was accepted by the CHMP. The dosing regimen used in ESTHER-2 was not based on modelling or 
estimation rather it was derived using clinical practice as a guide.  The approach was based on using the 
patient’s ovarian response in the previous cycle to determine the dose to be administered in the next cycle. 
Therefore a patient that had an adequate response in the first cycle was started on the same dose, if the 
response was inadequate in the first cycle the dose was adjusted up by 25% or 50% depending on the number 
of oocytes retrieved and vice-versa if there was an excessive response the dose was adjusted down by 25% or 
50%. The strategy used is acceptable. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of follitropin delta was generally acceptable and similar to the safety profile of GONAL-F. 
No new safety concern was raised from the findings in clinical studies.  
The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions (ADR) in the phase 3 studies was headache observed in 
5.3% of patients with follitropin delta and 4.5% with GONAL-F at first stimulation cycle, with decreasing 
frequency across the cycles.   
Follitropin delta had limited immunogenicity with no clinical relevance. In patients who presented 
treatment-induced anti-FSH antibodies (two cases with follitropin delta) the ovarian response was not affected. 
Only one patient had anti-FSH antibodies with neutralizing capacity (at pre-dosing stage) but a clinical relevant 
impact was not observed as the patient had several oocytes retrieved and ongoing pregnancy.  
Serious adverse events (SAE) were limited in the two groups (2% with follitropin delta and 1.5% with 
GONAL-F). Most of them were pregnancy complications and assessed as having no reasonable causality 
relationship with the treatment. Cases of severe OHSS occurred in 3 patients with follitropin delta and 8 patients 
with GONAL-F. The mean duration of hospitalization for each patient was lower with follitropin delta (4 days) 
compared to GONAL F(8 days).  
No deaths have been reported in subjects participating to the clinical programme.  
Cases of injection site reaction were comparable between follitropin delta and GONAL-F (31% of patients in 
COS cycle 1) with increasing incidence across the COS cycles. The pattern of injection site reactions was not 
more favourable with follitropin delta in comparison with GONAL-F.  
The available data on pregnancy outcome and neonatal health, including cryopreserved cycles (interim data), do 
not suggest an increased risk of major congenital anomalies, compared to GONAL-F.

3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
According to the applicant rationale, the individualized dosing regimen with REKOVELLE (based on AMH and 
body weight) is supposed to produce an adequate ovarian stimulation response and to limit the rate of patients 
presenting OHSS. However, from ESTHER-1 results, cases of total OHSS occurred in 3.5% of patients with 
REKOVELLE and 4.8% with GONAL-F but statistically significant difference was not reached (p=0.238). Only a 
significant decrease in “OHSS’ preventive interventions” was observed with REKOVELLE (2.3%) compared to 
GONAL-F (4.5%), p = 0.005. There was a suggestion therefore that FE999049 may be slightly better in patients 
at risk of excessive response. Of note, only early OHSS are preventable. Late forms of OHSS are usually more 
of concern. Although proportion of late OHSS was lower with REKOVELLE (0.9%) compared to GONAL-F (1.8%), 
this difference was again not statistically significant (p=0.320). Finally, based on the data submitted, it was 
impossible to conclude on difference between follitropin alfa and follitropin delta with regards to the OHSS 
profile.  
During the procedure it was extensively discussed whether the use of micrograms instead of IU was likely to 
increase medication errors, in particular the potential of incorrect dose. In the phase 3 studies, incorrect dose 
was administered more frequently with REKOVELLE (12 cases) vs GONAL-F (5 cases). Clinical consequences of 
such errors were not known. Clearer statements were introduced in the SmPC regarding the dose calculation 
and revised “Instructions for use” for a correct use of the pen were agreed. In addition 14 events of pen 
malfunctions occurred with REKOVELLE and none with GONAL-F. Given it was assessed to be due to 
“inadequate instructions” or “misunderstanding of use instructions” the “Instructions for use” were revised to 
address the risk of pen malfunctions.  
The data on neonatal health from cryopreserved cycles were still collected at the time of the CHMP Opinion and 
no final conclusion regarding this aspect could be made. Completed follow-up data from cryopreserved cycles for 
both ESTHER 1 and ESTHER 2 studies will be submitted in the post-authorisation phase.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The heterogeneity of responses in subgroups by age and by AMH stratum was observed in Esther-1.  
There was an unexpected large positive response (for the co-primary endpoints) in a small subgroup of ≥ 38 
year old women contrary to a response in women < 38 year old. This was of particular importance given the last 
subgroup represented the very large majority of subjects included in the pivotal trial as well as all subjects 
included in phase 2 dose-finding trial. The analysis of the distribution of ongoing pregnancy and implantation 
rates across 1 year age strata from 25 to 40 year old demonstrated that there is no clear trend of decreasing 
efficacy as subjects get younger.  
Regarding the analysis in women with low AMH stratum the applicant considered that gonadotropin dose was 
not a predictor for pregnancy per se but rather dose was a predictor of ovarian response (i.e. number of oocytes 
retrieved and risk of OHSS). This argument was acceptable and it was also agreed that AMH levels are markers 
of ovarian reserve and ability to respond to gonadotropin. The results showing the number of oocytes retrieved 
and percentage of subjects with successful transfer was provided which suggested no difference between FE

999049 and Gonal-F in women with AMH≤15pmol/L. In women with AMH < 15 pmol/l, the numerical imbalance 
in favour of Gonal-F appears to persist with a treatment difference of -3.7% noted for ongoing pregnancy rate 
and -3.2% for ongoing implantation rate. However it was acknowledged that the observed pregnancy and 
ongoing rate implantation rate were similar to the expected pregnancy and implantation rates and did not 
indicate a lack of efficacy. Taking into consideration also that the ESTHER-1 trial was not powered or designed 
to demonstrate non-inferiority within subgroups the applicant’s view that the results are due to random 
variation rather than a reduced efficacy of FE 999049 when compared to Gonal-F was accepted and this  major 
objection was considered as solved. 
Important issue on the choice of the non-inferiority margin was meant to challenge the clinical relevance of 
the non-inferiority conclusion in the light of the actual results so that additional insurance could be brought to 
the small loss of efficacy observed in the trial. The ENGAGE study (with corifollitropin alfa), upon which the 
non-inferiority margin was based, provided a confidence interval lower bound of -4% for the ongoing pregnancy 
rate, which was higher than the non-inferiority margin of -8% and which could even guarantee a loss of efficacy 
less than 5%. The required sample size for the formal demonstration of -5% non-inferiority would have been 
more significant (2800 patients), but trials of such size are not that uncommon, and the size of the trial should 
always fit any relevant clinical objective. Regarding the phase 2 trial, there were some hints that the 
non-inferiority would be challenging for the ongoing pregnancy endpoint with the chosen non-inferiority margin. 
Without considering the full magnitude of the negative response observed in the phase 2 trial (which would 
require a tremendous amount of patients), it would have been wiser to consider a small loss of efficacy in the 
sample size calculation of the pivotal study. This unanticipated loss of efficacy led, to some extent, to under 
power the phase 3 trial for the main subgroup of subjects ≤ 38 year. 
Although a more uniform ovarian response was observed with individualized dosing regimen of follitropin 
delta, it did not translate into a better pregnancy rate, and in fact even a lower pregnancy rate was observed in 
women aged 37 years and less. No additional benefits in terms of risk of cycle cancellations due to poor ovarian 
response were obtained with follitropin delta as compared to Gonal-F. 
The safety profile of follitropin delta, including general and local tolerability, appeared to be acceptable with no 
increased immunogenicity potential compared to other approved gonadotropin. However, obvious improvement 
in global OHSS profile was not observed. Although cases of total OHSS were numerically lower with follitropin 
delta in comparison with GONAL-F, the difference was not statistically significant. Such improvement was 
however expected given the individualized new dosing regimen. OHSS preventing interventions (in patients with 
high risk of excessive response) were more frequent with GONAL F than with REKOVELLE. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Following the assessment of balance of benefits and risks with the use of Rekovelle the CHMP considered that 
the overall B/R of REKOVELLE was positive. All the uncertainties with regards the benefits (non-inferiority 
margin, efficacy by age strata and AMH level) and with regards to safety have been solved. The conclusion of 
non-inferiority was therefore accepted. The fact that there was no experience with Rekovelle in the long GnRH 
agonist protocol was reflected in Section 4.1 of the SmPC in line with similar products in this therapeutic field.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Rekovelle is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of Rekovelle is favourable in the following indication: 
Controlled ovarian stimulation for the development of multiple follicles in women undergoing assisted 
reproductive technologies (ART) such as an in vitro fertilisation (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) 
cycle. 
There is no clinical trial experience with REKOVELLE in the long GnRH agonist protocol (see section 5.1).

New Active Substance Status 
Based on the review of the available data, the CHMP considers that follitropin delta, which have some differences 
in molecular structure, nature of the source material or manufacturing process, does not differ significantly in 
properties with regard to safety and/or efficacy from follitropin alfa and follitropin beta contained in medicinal 
products previously authorised within the European Union and therefore is not considered to be a new active 
substance.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
Gilead Sciences Ireland UC submitted on 28 May 2021 a group of variation(s) consisting of an 
extension of the marketing authorisation and the following variation(s): 
Variation(s) requested 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
II 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
The MAH applied for an extension application to introduce a new strength (30 mg/120 mg/15 mg film-
coated tablets). The extension application is grouped with a type II variation (C.I.6.a) to include 
treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in paediatric patients at least 2 years 
of age and weighing at least 14 kg without present or past evidence of viral resistance to the integrase 
inhibitor class, emtricitabine or tenofovir. Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC and the 
Package Leaflet are updated to support the extended indication. The RMP (version 3.1) is updated in 
accordance.  
1.2.  Legal basis and dossier content 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 – Group of variations. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, quality data, clinical data based 
on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting certain 
tests or studies. 
1.3.  Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0038/2021 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the P/0038/2021 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP (EMEA-001766-PIP01-15-M03). 
1.4.  Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
1.4.1.  Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication.

discussion within the Committee, issued a positive opinion for granting 
a marketing authorisation to Biktarvy on  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) targets the immune system and weakens people's defence 
against many infections and some types of cancer that people with healthy immune systems can fight 
off. As the virus destroys and impairs the function of immune cells, infected individuals gradually 
become immunodeficient. Immune function is typically measured by CD4 cell count. The most 
advanced stage of HIV infection is acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), which can take many 
years to develop if not treated, depending on the individual. AIDS is defined by the development of 
certain cancers, infections, or other severe long-term clinical manifestations. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
There were approximately 37.6 million people across the globe with HIV in 2020. Of these, 35.9 million 
were adults and 1.7 million were children (<15 years old). In 2020, 680 000 [480 000–1.0 million] 
people died from HIV-related causes and 1.5 million [1.0–2.0 million] people acquired HIV. 
As of the end of 2020, 27.4 million people with HIV (73%) were accessing antiretroviral therapy (ART) 
globally. That means 10.2 million people are still waiting. People with HIV who are aware of their 
status, take ART daily as prescribed, and get and keep an undetectable viral load can live long, healthy 
lives and have effectively no risk of sexually transmitting HIV to their HIV-negative partner. UNAIDS 
reports that in 2020, of all people with HIV worldwide: 84% knew their HIV status, 73% were 
accessing ART, and 66% were virally suppressed. 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
The symptoms of HIV vary depending on the stage of infection. Though people living with HIV tend to 
be most infectious in the first few months after being infected, many are unaware of their status until 
the later stages. In the first few weeks after initial infection people may experience no symptoms or an 
influenza-like illness including fever, headache, rash or sore throat. As the infection progressively 
weakens the immune system, they can develop other signs and symptoms, such as swollen lymph

extension of indication variation  
EMA/807473/2022

nodes, weight loss, fever, diarrhoea and cough. Without treatment, they could also develop severe 
illnesses such as tuberculosis (TB), cryptococcal meningitis, severe bacterial infections, and cancers 
such as lymphomas and Kaposi's sarcoma. 
2.1.4.  Management 
A once daily, single-tablet regimen (STR) has been shown to significantly improve adherence, 
treatment satisfaction, and virologic outcome for patients infected with HIV-1. Many paediatric patients 
would also benefit from the availability of a simplified, once daily STR that combined potent efficacy, 
tolerability, a favourable toxicity profile, a low potential for drug-drug interactions, and practical, 
convenient dosing.  
Six STRs are currently approved in the EU for once daily administration in the treatment of HIV-1 
infection in adolescents: elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF), 
elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF) co-formulated, 
abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine, emtricitabine /rilpivirine/TAF (FTC/RPV/TAF), 
dolutegravir/lamivudine (DTG/3TC) and darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide 
(DRV/COBI/FTC/TAF). 
2.2.  About the product 
Biktarvy (BVY; bictegravir [B; BIC]/emtricitabine [F; FTC]/tenofovir alafenamide [TAF]) is an oral, once 
daily fixed-dose combination (FDC) that provides a potent and well tolerated regimen for the treatment 
of patients infected with HIV-1. Biktarvy contains the integrase strand transfer inhibitor BIC, the 
nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor FTC, and the nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor TAF. 
Biktarvy was approved for commercial use in adults in the United States (US) on 07 February 2018 
and in the European Union (EU) on 21 June 2018. The indication was extended in the US to include 
paediatric patients weighing ≥ 25 kg on 18 June 2019, and BVY is recommended as a preferred 
antiretroviral regimen for children aged ≥ 6 years and weighing ≥ 25 kg in current US Department of 
Health and Human Services Guidelines for the Use of Antiretroviral Agents in Paediatric HIV Infection 
(Panel on Antiretroviral Therapy and Medical Management of Children Living with HIV 2021). 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
The MAH is herewith submitting an application under article 7.2(b) EC No 1234/2008 to extend the 
Biktarvy marketing authorization with the introduction of an age-appropriate formulation (Biktarvy 
30/120/15 mg film-coated tablets), grouped with a Type II C.I.6.a variation to introduce the paediatric 
indication, use in patients < 18 years of age down to ≥ 2 years of age weighing at least 14 kg. 
Study GS-US-380-1474 was performed in accordance with recognized international scientific and 
ethical standards, including but not limited to the International Council for Harmonisation (of Technical 
Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use) (ICH) guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) 
(Sections 7.5, 8.1.2, and 8.2.2), and the original principles embodied in the Declaration of Helsinki.

2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The finished product applied for in this line extension is presented as film-coated tablets containing a 
fixed dose combination of 30 mg of bictegravir, 120 mg of emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide 
fumarate equivalent to 15 mg of tenofovir alafenamide as active substances.  
Other ingredients are: 
Tablet core: microcrystalline cellulose (E460) croscarmellose sodium (E468) and magnesium stearate 
(E470b); 
Film-coating: polyvinyl alcohol (E203) titanium dioxide (E171) macrogol (E1521), talc (E553b), iron 
oxide red (E172) and iron oxide black (E172). 
The product is available in white, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle with a polypropylene 
continuous-thread, child-resistant cap, lined with an induction activated aluminium foil liner. Each 
bottle contains a silica gel desiccant and a polyester coil as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
The active substances bictegravir, emtricitabine, and tenofovir alafenamide fumarate are manufactured 
by the same manufacturers and to the same standards as the approved Biktarvy 50/200/25 mg 
tablets. No new information is provided for this line extension. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Biktarvy (BIC/FTC/TAF) fixed-dose combination (FDC) tablets are an immediate-release oral dosage 
form containing 30 mg of bictegravir (BIC, B), 120 mg of emtricitabine (FTC, F), and 15 mg of 
tenofovir alafenamide (TAF). BIC/FTC/TAF tablets, 30/120/15 mg, are pink, capsule-shaped, film-
coated tablets, debossed with "BVY" on one side and a score line on the other side and measure 
approximately 14 x 6 mm. 
A fixed dose combination of BIC/FTC/TAF is already approved as a 50 mg/200 mg/25 mg film coated 
tablet. The aim of this pharmaceutical development was to develop a paediatric dosage form 
containing a lower strength of each active substance. 
The excipients used are the same as the ones used for the approved strength 50/200/25 mg tablets 
except for the colorant. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients compliant with Ph. 
Eur. or EU standards for colorants. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in 
paragraph 2.4.1 of this report. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. 
The choice of this colouring agent in a paediatric preparation is considered acceptable since it was 
already approved for other paediatric medicines. Differences in colour and debossing are sufficient to 
distinguish the new and existing formulations. 
Formulation development focused on developing a lower strength tablet appropriate for the paediatric 
population while achieving the established biopharmaceutical performance of BIC sodium, FTC, and 
TAF as in the approved tablets. Bictegravir sodium is a crystalline, stable, BCS class II compound 
exhibiting low solubility but high permeability. Emtricitabine is a crystalline BCS class I compound with 
Assessment report on grouping of an extension of marketing authorisation and an 
extension of indication variation  
EMA/807473/2022  
Page 10/52 
 
 
 
high solubility and permeability which degrades by hydrolysis in aqueous solution and to a much 
smaller degree, in the solid phase. TAF is a BCS class III molecule, highly soluble but poorly 
permeable, which undergoes pH-dependent hydrolysis in aqueous solution. The formulation used in the 
relative bioavailability study and phase 3 clinical studies is the same as intended for commercialisation, 
other than changes in debossing and addition of a score line. 
The new tablet is intended for children aged 2 years and above. In the paediatric investigation plan 
(PIP), the PDCO recommended that an age-appropriate formulation be developed, and that 
acceptability and palatability data be generated for the smaller tablet since it is nonetheless quite large 
for the youngest children. This data was provided in clinical studies – however, some tablets were split 
to aid swallow(contrary to the 50/200/25 mg SmPC instructions - “tablets should not be chewed, 
crushed, or split”). Following a CHMP request, the MAH added a score line to the tablet and amended 
the SmPC (section 4.2 to state “For patients who are unable to swallow the tablet whole, the tablet 
may be split in half and both halves taken one after the other, ensuring that the full dose is taken 
immediately.” The CHMP recommended the MAH to provide validation data for relevant steps of the 
revised manufacturing process by December 2022 and 6 months’ stability data for the scored tablet by 
August 2023. The MAH also explained plans for development of an oral suspension as per the PIP. 
Fulfilment of the PIP is planned by September 2023 which is considered acceptable. 
The dissolution method is the same as used for the already approved strength and was developed to 
accommodate the different solubility and stability profiles of the 3 active substances. Discriminatory 
power was demonstrated against meaningful changes in composition and process parameters. 
The primary packaging is a white HDPE bottle with a polypropylene continuous thread, child-resistant 
cap, lined with an induction activated aluminium foil liner. Each bottle contains a silica gel desiccant 
and polyester coil. The materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the 
container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of 
the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
The manufacturing description and applied control strategy is considered acceptable. The in-process 
controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. Process 
validation will be performed prior to commercial distribution of 30/120/15 mg BIC/FTC/TAF tablets, 
including the revised process steps associated with introduction of a score line, as defined in the 
submitted validation protocol. Since the manufacturing process is a standard process, the absence of 
validation data is considered acceptable. 
The proposed holding times for BIC/FTC/TAF final powder blend, BIC/FTC/TAF tablet cores, and 
BIC/FTC/TAF film-coated tablets taking into account the stability data provided are considered 
acceptable since confirmation is provided that the finished product shelf life will be calculated in 
accordance with the Note For Guidance On start of shelf-life of the finished dosage form 
CPMP/QWP/072/96. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form. 
Assessment report on grouping of an extension of marketing authorisation and an 
extension of indication variation  
EMA/807473/2022  
Page 11/52 
 
 
 
The specifications are the same as those for the approved strength apart one degradant that has only 
been observed in the 30/120/15 mg strength tablets. The release and shelf-life limits for degradants 
are considered qualified and acceptable. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities and considering 
experience with the approved formulation. Based on the risk assessment, it can be concluded that no 
test for elemental impurities is needed. 
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
was submitted, considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and 
answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Despite the 
potential presence of secondary and tertiary amine impurities in the active substances, and the 
potential presence of nitrosating agents as excipient impurities, the MAH initially concluded that there 
is no risk of presence of nitrosamine impurities, given the formulation conditions. The CHMP did not 
except this argument and requested confirmatory testing on representative batches. The MAH provided 
confirmatory testing results for relevant nitrosamine impurities using a suitably validated and sensitive 
method and no nitrosamine impurities were detected above the limit of detection (corresponding to 1 
ng/tablet). Based on the information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine 
impurities the related finished product and no specific control measures are deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. The methods for assay and impurities are 
demonstrated to be stability-indicating. 
The finished product is released on the market based on the release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data were provided for production scale batches of finished product stored for up to 24 
months under long term conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated 
conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines. The batches of medicinal product are 
identical to those proposed for marketing and were packaged in the intended commercial container 
closure system. Samples were tested for appearance, water content, assay, degradation products, 
dissolution and microbiological quality. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. No 
significant changes to any of the measured parameters were observed except for a decrease in TAF 
assay and commensurate rise in impurity content. However, all parameters remained within their 
specification limits throughout shelf-life. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability. The 
finished product is photostable. 
Stress studies were carried out on one batch of BIC/FTC/TAF at -20°C for one month and 50 
ºC/ambient humidity for two weeks. No significant degradation was observed. 
An in-use stability study was performed on one batch at 30 °C/75% for up to 30 days. Stability data 
for all quality attributes measured comply with the specifications.

Based on the stability data provided, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months when stored in the original 
package and kept tightly closed to protect from moisture as described in the SmPC (section 6.3) is 
considered acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the benefit/risk ratio of the product. The MAH introduced a score line on the tablet and 
changed the de-bossing during the procedure to allow sub-division of tablets and facilitate swallowing 
by patients unable to swallow the whole tablet. The MAH should conduct process validation on relevant 
steps of the revised process, provide batch analysis data and provide 6 months’ stability data on the 
scored tablets. These points are put forward and agreed as recommendations for future quality 
development. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
• 
• 
The MAH should conduct process validation on relevant steps of the revised process and 
provide batch analysis data on the scored tablets by 31st December 2022. 
The MAH should provide 6 months’ stability data on the scored tablets by 31st August 2023. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
A comprehensive non-clinical program of pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology studies was 
performed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of bictegravir / emtricitabine / tenofovir alafenamide 
for the original MAA. 
Apart from environmental studies, no new non-clinical data were provided with this application.

2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
The pharmacologic basis to recommend the BIC/FTC/TAF 50/200/25 mg and 30/120/15 mg for the 
treatment of HIV infection in the paediatric patient population < 18 years of age down to ≥ 2 years of 
age weighing ≥ 14 kg is scientifically justified based on the non-clinical in vitro and in vivo efficacy 
data for the individual components and the combination of the agents presented in this dossier. 
No new pharmacology data were provided with this application. This is considered satisfactory. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic profiles of BIC, FTC, and TAF are well characterized in multiple animal species 
and the findings support the use of these agents in combination. Of note, data from clinical studies 
with the combination demonstrated acceptable tolerability and safety profiles to support use in the 
paediatric patient population < 18 years of age down to ≥ 2 years of age weighing ≥ 14 kg. 
No new PK data were provided with this application. This is considered satisfactory. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
No juvenile toxicity studies have been conducted with BIC, FTC, TAF, or the combination.  
The non-clinical overview includes justifications for the lack of such studies. 
According to European Medicines Agency decision P/0038/2021 of 27 January 2021 on the acceptance 
of a modification of an agreed paediatric investigation plan for bictegravir /emtricitabine / tenofovir 
alafenamide (Biktarvy), (EMEA-001766-PIP01-15-M03), no juvenile study is required. The prenatal and 
postnatal reproductive toxicity study of bictegravir in rats has been performed as required and already 
assessed in the initial submission. 
The targeted population in this line extension is the paediatric patient population < 18 years of age 
down to ≥ 2 years of age weighing ≥ 14 kg. No new studies were recommended by the PedCo, the 
available data submitted during the initial submission being considered sufficient. 
In conclusion, the combination of BIC, FTC, and TAF is not anticipated to exacerbate known toxicities 
or lead to new toxicities. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In the original MAA for Biktarvy, a standard battery of environmental fate and effects studies were 
conducted to evaluate the environmental risk associated with the use of BIC, FTC and TAF.  
At that time, Phase IIb studies for bictegravir were still in progress. Since 2018, the MAH has 
completed 6 studies, which were submitted with this line extension.  
For emtricitabine and tenofovir no new study was provided. 
The MAH submitted an updated ERA for the individual substances bictegravir, emtricitabine and 
tenofovir alafenamide and an updated ERA for the combination. The prevalence of HIV in 2019 for all 
population in the EU, including paediatric population, has been taken into account. A worst case 
scenario was used, which is relevant for this line extension.

Page 14/52 
 
 
 
Relevant residues of BIC, FTC and TAF in the environment were determined and showed low risk to the 
environment. Approval of this line extension will not lead to any unacceptable risks to aquatic or 
terrestrial ecosystems. 
In conclusion, the use of Biktarvy as a treatment for HIV poses an acceptable risk to the environment.  
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
A comprehensive non-clinical program of pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology studies was 
performed and demonstrated the safety and efficacy of bictegravir / emtricitabine / tenofovir 
alafenamide for the original MAA. 
There are no anticipated clinically relevant pharmacokinetic or toxicological interactions expected in the 
BIC/FTC/TAF FDC in the paediatric population. 
Overall, the toxicology programme revealed that combination of BIC, FTC, and TAF does not 
exacerbate known toxicities or lead to new toxicities. BIC, FTC, or TAF have not shown significant 
adverse effects as individual agents in reproductive and developmental toxicity studies. The 
combination of the 3 components is not expected to have an altered reproductive toxicity profile as 
compared with that of the individual agents.  
The BIC/FTC/TAF 50/200/25 mg and 30/120/15 mg are considered to have low potential for toxicity in 
the paediatric patient population < 18 years of age down to ≥ 2 years of age weighing ≥ 14 kg and the 
existing non-clinical data supports the proposed use. 
From the results of ERA studies, no significant environmental safety issues were identified. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The overall existing non-clinical programme to date, including data from the combination and 
individual drug studies, supports the efficacy and safety of BIC/FTC/TAF 50/200/25 mg and 30/120/15 
mg in the sought indication. 
Apart from environmental studies, no new non-clinical data were provided with this extension 
application which is in in accordance with the CHMP Guideline on the Non-Clinical Development of Fixed 
Combinations of Medicinal Products (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005, January 2008). 
Concerning the environmental risk assessment, new studies were provided, which allowed to conclude 
that approval of this line extension will not lead to any increased risk to aquatic or terrestrial 
ecosystems. 
2.6.  Clinical aspects 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
GCP aspects 
The clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
2.6.2.1.1.  Introduction 
Biktarvy (BIC/FTC/TAF) is an oral, once daily fixed-dose combination (FDC) that provides a regimen for 
the treatment of patients infected with HIV-1. 
Biktarvy contains the integrase strand transfer inhibitor BIC, the nucleoside reverse transcriptase 
inhibitor FTC, and the nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor TAF. Biktarvy was approved in adults in 
the United States (US) on 07 February 2018 and in the European Union (EU) on 21 June 2018.  
Prior to this application, the BIC/FTC/TAF 50/200/25 mg FDC was indicated in the EU for the treatment 
of adults infected with HIV-1 without present or past evidence of viral resistance to the integrase 
inhibitor class, FTC, or tenofovir (TFV).  
A once daily, single-tablet regimen (STR) has been shown to significantly improve adherence, 
treatment satisfaction, and virologic outcome for patients infected with HIV-1. Many paediatric patients 
would also benefit from the availability of a simplified, once daily STR that combined potent efficacy,

extension of indication variation

tolerability, a favourable toxicity profile, a low potential for drug-drug interactions, and practical, 
convenient dosing. BIC/FTC/TAF may provide an improved option for paediatric patients for whom it 
would be better to avoid the potential for adverse reactions arising from less tolerated agents such as 
ritonavir (RTV)-boosted protease inhibitors or central nervous system adverse events (AEs) due to 
EFV. Additionally, as BIC, FTC, and TAF are not clinically relevant inhibitors or inducers of major human 
drug-metabolizing enzymes or transporters, there is low potential for BIC/FTC/TAF to cause drug-drug 
interactions (DDIs). Because no PK enhancer such as COBI or RTV is required to maintain BIC plasma 
concentrations, the DDI potential of BIC/FTC/TAF is lower than that of other approved agents. The 
reduced risk of DDIs is an important benefit in the maintenance of treatment adherence in a paediatric 
population. Moreover, a TAF-containing regimen would be a better choice than a TDF-based regimen in 
this population due to a more favourable bone and renal profile. The small tablet size of the low-dose 
BIC/FTC/TAF FDC is expected to provide a further benefit for paediatric patients for whom pill 
swallowing can be a barrier to treatment compliance. 
The low-dose BIC/FTC/TAF 30/120/15 mg tablet was developed to support the Phase 2/3 Study GS-
US-380-1474 in paediatric patients with HIV-infection and is the proposed commercial tablet 
formulation. The designated commercial drug product is an immediate-release FDC tablet containing 
30 mg of BIC, 120 mg of FTC, and 15 mg of TAF. BIC is incorporated into the drug product as BIC 
sodium, and TAF is incorporated into the drug product as the hemifumarate form (referred to as TAF 
fumarate). Due to the differences in dosage strengths, PK parameters derived using the low-dose 
BIC/FTC/TAF tablet were normalized by dividing each value by 0.6, the ratio of the test dose/reference 
dose. The dose-normalized results show the low-dose BIC/FTC/TAF30/120/15 mg tablet demonstrated 
bioequivalence to the adult-strength BIC/FTC/TAF50/200/25 mg tablet. 
The PK of BIC, TAF and TFV (the main metabolite of TAF) in virologically suppressed adolescents ≥ 12 
to < 18 years of age weighing ≥ 35 kg and children ≥ 6 to < 12 years of age weighing ≥ 25 kg 
receiving the adult-strength BIC/FTC/TAF 50/200/25 mg FDC, and children ≥ 2 years of age weighing 
≥ 14 to < 25 kg receiving the low-dose BIC/FTC/TAF 30/120/15 mg FDC were estimated by a 
population PK (PopPK) approach using all available intensive and sparse paediatric plasma 
concentration data. For BIC, paediatric PK data were derived from Study GS-US-380 1474. For TAF 
and TFV, paediatric data were derived from Study GS-US-380-1474, E/C/F/TAF Studies GS-US-292-
0106 and GS-US-292-1515, and F/TAF Study GS-US-311-1269, as summarised in tables 3 and 4 
below, respectively.

Table 2: Population Pharmacokinetics of TAF and TFV in HIV-1 Infected Paediatric Subjects; 
Studies included in the PopPK Analysis 
To confirm the appropriateness of the BIC/FTC/TAF 50/200/25 mg, adult-strength dose in adolescents 
≥ 12 to < 18 years of age weighing ≥ 35 kg (Cohort 1) and children ≥ 6 to < 12 years of age weighing 
≥ 25 kg (Cohort 2), and low-dose BIC/FTC/TAF 30/120/15 mg in children ≥ 2 years of age weighing ≥ 
14 kg to < 25 kg (Cohort 3), exposures of BIC, FTC, and TAF in paediatric subjects were compared 
with historical data from HIV-1 infected adults treated with BIC/FTC/TAF in the BIC/FTC/TAF Phase 3 
pivotal studies GS-US-380-1489, GS-US-380-1490, GS-US-380-1844, and GS-US-380-1878, as 
appropriate.  
A PK equivalence boundary of 70% to 143% was used for Cohorts 1 and 2, and 50% to 200% was 
used for Cohort 3. The wider PK equivalence boundary specified for Cohort 3 was used to take account 
of the inherent variability of BIC exposures observed in paediatric subjects ≥ 6 years of age weighing 
≥ 25 kg (Cohorts 1 and 2 of Study GS-US-380-1474). This was justified by taking into consideration 
the available PK, efficacy, and safety data from Phase 3 studies of BIC/FTC/TAF 50/200/25 mg in 
adults. 
Population PK parameters of TAF and intensive PK parameters of FTC were compared with historical 
PopPK and intensive PK data, respectively, in HIV-infected adults treated with BIC/FTC/TAF. As TFV 
exposures were not derived in the BIC/FTC/TAF-treated HIV-1 infected adult subjects in the Phase 3 
Studies, PopPK parameters of TFV for adolescents and children were compared with those in HIV-1

infected adults receiving GEN, for which safety and efficacy in this population had been previously 
established. 
2.6.2.1.2.  Bioanalytical methods 
A LC-MS/MS assay procedure was used for determination of plasma concentration of the individual 
components of Biktarvy (BIC, FTC, and TAF), and TFV, the main metabolite of TAF.  
2.6.2.1.3.  Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Population PK models were developed to characterize the exposures of BIC, TAF, and TFV in virologically 
suppressed  adolescents  and  children  ≥  2  years  of  age  weighing  ≥  14  kg  in  both  the  PK  lead-in  and 
treatment  phases  using  all  available  intensive  and  sparse  plasma  concentration  data.  Population  PK 
parameters of BIC, TAF, and TFV were predicted and are presented in the subsequent sections. For FTC, 
PK  parameters  estimated  from  analysis  of  the  intensive  PK  samples  from  the  PK  lead-in  phase  were 
used. To confirm the appropriateness of the BIC/FTC/TAF doses in virologically suppressed children and 
adolescents  ≥  2  years  of  age  weighing  ≥  14  kg,  PopPK  parameters  AUCtau  and  Ctau  for  BIC  were 
compared  to  historical  PopPK  data  in  HIV-1  infected  adults  treated  with  BIC/FTC/TAF  using  a  PK 
equivalence boundary of 70% to 143% for Cohorts 1 and 2, and a PK equivalence boundary of 50% to 
200% for Cohort 3. The wider PK equivalence boundary specified for Cohort 3 was used to take account 
of the inherent variability of BIC exposures observed in paediatric subjects in Cohorts 1 and 2. This was 
justified by taking into consideration the available PK, efficacy, and safety data from Phase 3 studies of 
BVY  (BIC/FTC/TAF  50/200/25  mg)  in  adults  (Study  GS-US-380-1474  Protocol).  Population  PK 
parameters of TAF and intensive PK parameters of FTC were compared to historical PopPK and intensive 
PK data, as appropriate, in HIV-1 infected adults treated with BVY. As TFV exposures were not derived 
for BVY-treated HIV-1 infected adults in the Phase 3 studies, PopPK parameters of TFV for adolescents 
and  children  were  compared  to  historical  PopPK  data  in  HIV-1  infected  adults  treated  with  GEN 
(E/C/F/TAF 150/150/200/10 mg). 
2.6.2.1.4.  Bioequivalence and Influence of food 
The bioavailability of BIC, FTC, and TAF from low-dose BIC/FTC/TAF 30/120/15 mg tablets (Batch 
FX1701B), was evaluated against the marketed adult-strength BIC/FTC/TAF 50/200/25 mg tablets in 
Study GS-US-380-4424. Although the production methods are different in the two strengths, both use 
the same excipients and are fully dose proportional. Due to the differences in dosage strengths, PK 
parameters derived using the low-dose BIC/FTC/TAF tablet were normalized by dividing each value by 
0.6, the ratio of the test dose/reference dose. The dose-normalized results show the low-dose 
BIC/FTC/TAF 30/120/15 mg tablet demonstrated bioequivalence to the adult-strength 
BIC/FTC/TAF50/200/25 mg tablet for AUC and Cmax within the pre-specified limits of 70% - 143%. In 
fact, all comparison were inside the typical acceptance interval of 80-125%. The same low-dose 
BIC/FTC/TAF 30/120/15 mg tablet formulation was used in all further development, clinical, and 
stability studies, and is identical to the designated commercial tablet formulation. 
The food effect on BIC, FTC, and TAF from low-dose BIC/FTC/TAF 30/120/15 mg tablets, was 
evaluated again in Study GS-US-380-4424. A high-fat meal had no impact on BIC exposures (AUCinf, 
AUClast, and Cmax) but delayed the median Tmax of BIC from 1 hour to 4 hours. For FTC, the GLSM 
ratios and 90% CIs for AUCinf, AUClast, and Cmax were within the PK equivalence boundary of 70% to 
143%, and median Tmax was delayed (from 1.00 hour to 2.00 hours) after administration with a high-
fat meal. Mean TAF AUCinf increased by 42%, Cmax decreased by 44%, and the median Tmax was 
delayed (from 0.5 hour to 1.5 hours) after administration with a high-fat meal compared with fasted.

Page 19/52 
 
 
 
Being BIC and TAF low solubility drugs, food is expected to increase the bioavailability of both drugs. 
For BIC, in particular, this effect was demonstrated when administered as single agent or as a FDC 
with TAF and FTC but was not relevant in the low dose FDC. For TAF, the bioavailability increase 
observed with food after the administration with the FDC formulation is consistent with historical data 
of TAF as a single agent and as the F/TAF combination. For FTC, being this a BCS class 1 drug, a 
significant food effect was not expected.  
Although these differences in bioavailability of TAF due to concomitant administration with food exist, 
the BIC/FTC/TAF FDC formulations were administered without regard to food in Phase 2/3 study in 
HIV-1 infected adolescents and children. As such, it is acceptable to conclude that BIC/FTC/TAF can be 
administered without regard to food. 
2.6.2.1.5.  Pharmacokinetics in HIV-1 Infected Paediatric Subjects 
The paediatric pharmacokinetics in HIV-1 Infected paediatric subjects for the individual components of 
Biktarvy BIC, FTC and TAF are summarised below, together with TFV. 
•  BIC Pharmacokinetics in HIV-1 Infected Paediatric Subjects 
Plasma concentrations of BIC were best described by a 1-compartment model with first-order 
absorption with a lag time and first-order elimination. The effect of WT (body weight) on CL/F and Vc/F 
was included using fixed allometric exponents of 0.75 and 1, respectively. The effect of PPI (Proton-
pump inhibitor) administration was added to ka and fixed to the value estimated in adults. Asian race 
on CL/F (−26.9%) and Vc/F (−27.2%) was found to be significant during the stepwise covariate 
modelling search. No additional covariates were found to significantly affect BIC exposure. 
BIC exposures were inversely correlated with WT, percentage changes in BIC exposures ranging from 
−44.3% to +99.8% (relative to median exposures) for subjects with extreme covariate values (i.e., 
5th and 95th WT percentiles). Based on the protocol-defined and weight-based dosing strategy and 
favourable clinical safety profile, these changes in exposure were not deemed clinically significant. 
•  FTC Pharmacokinetics in HIV-1 Infected Paediatric Subjects 
Exposures of FTC in adolescents weighing ≥ 35 kg and children weighing ≥ 25 kg receiving adult-
strength BVY tablets (BIC/FTC/TAF50/200/25 mg) were compared with pooled intensive PK data from 
Phase 3 Studies GS-US-380-1489, GS-US-380-1490, GS-US-380-1844, and GS-US-380-1878 (N = 77) 
in HIV-1 infected adult subjects. 
In adolescents ≥ 35 kg, FTC AUCtau and Cmax were comparable to those in adults from the Phase 3 
BVY studies. FTC Ctau was 31% lower than observed in adults. 
In children ≥ 25 kg, FTC Ctau was comparable to that in adults from the Phase 3 BVY studies. FTC 
AUCtau and Cmax were 42% and 85% higher, respectively, than in adults.  
These differences in FTC PK were not deemed clinically relevant based on the favourable safety profile 
of BIC/FTC/TAF. 
Exposures of FTC in children ≥ 2 years of age weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg receiving the low dose BVY 
tablet (BIC/FTC/TAF30/120/15 mg) were compared to pooled intensive PK data from the Phase 3 
Assessment report on grouping of an extension of marketing authorisation and an 
extension of indication variation  
EMA/807473/2022  
Page 20/52 
 
 
 
Studies GS-US-380-1489, GS-US-380-1490, GS-US-380-1844, and GS-US-380-1878 (N = 77) in HIV-
1 infected adult subjects receiving the adult-strength BVY tablet (BIC/FTC/TAF50/200/25 mg) 
In children ≥ 2 years of age weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg, FTC AUCtau and Ctau were comparable to 
those in adult subjects in the Phase 3 BVY studies. FTC Cmax was 81% higher than in adults; this 
difference was not deemed clinically relevant based on the favourable safety profile of BVY.  
•  TAF Pharmacokinetics in HIV-1 Infected Paediatric Subjects 
Predicted systemic exposures of TAF in adolescents weighing ≥ 35 kg and children weighing ≥ 25 kg 
receiving adult-strength BVY tablets (BIC/FTC/TAF 50/200/25 mg) were compared with those from 
BVY-treated, HIV-1 infected adult subjects in the Phase 3 Studies GS-US-380-1489 and GS-US-380-
1490 (N = 486). Tenofovir alafenamide AUCtau and Cmax in BVY-treated adolescents ≥ 35 kg were 
generally comparable to those in adults. 
Tenofovir alafenamide AUCtau and Cmax in children ≥ 25 kg who received adult-strength BVY tablets 
(BIC/FTC/TAF 50/200/25 mg) were 60% and 33% higher, respectively, compared to adults. Exposures 
of TAF in children were within the range of safe exposures from historical data in adults for approved 
F/TAF-containing products. In consideration of the favourable safety profile for BVY in the paediatric 
population and the lack of an exposure-safety relationship for TAF in the Phase 3 BIC/FTC/TAF 
development programme, higher TAF exposure in children was not considered clinically relevant. 
Predicted systemic exposures of TAF in children ≥ 2 years of age weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg receiving 
low dose BVY tablets (BIC/FTC/TAF 30/120/15 mg) were compared with those from BVY-treated, HIV-
1 infected adult subjects in the Phase 3 Studies GS-US-380-1489 and GS-US-380-1490 (N = 486). 
Tenofovir alafenamide Cmax in BVY-treated children ≥ 2 years of age weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg was 
comparable to that in adults. The modestly higher (42%) TAF AUCtau was within the range of safe 
exposures from historical data in adults for approved F/TAF-containing products. In consideration of 
the favourable safety profile for BIC/FTC/TAF in the paediatric population and the lack of an exposure-
safety relationship for TAF in the Phase 3 BIC/FTC/TAF development program, higher TAF exposure in 
children was not considered clinically relevant. 
Plasma concentrations of TAF were best described by a 1-compartment model with sequential zero-
order first-order absorption and first-order elimination. The effects of WT on CL/F and Vc/F were 
included using fixed allometric exponents of 0.75 and 1, respectively. COBI was found to affect F1 
(163.6% increase). No additional covariates were found to significantly affect TAF exposure. 
TAF exposures were inversely correlated with WT, with percent changes in TAF exposures ranging from 
−36% to +84.7% (relative to median exposures) for subjects with extreme covariate values (ie, 5th 
and 95th WT percentiles, respectively). In addition, COBI was the most influential covariate with an 
increase in TAF exposures of +164%. Based on the protocol-defined, boosted third agent- and WT-
based dosing strategy, these changes in exposure have been appropriately accounted for. 
•  TFV Pharmacokinetics in HIV-1 Infected Paediatric Subjects 
Predicted systemic exposures of TFV in adolescents weighing ≥ 35 kg (Cohort 1) and children weighing 
≥ 25 kg (Cohort 2) receiving adult-strength BIC/FTC/TAF were compared with those from GEN-treated,

HIV-1 infected adult subjects in the Phase 3 Studies GS-US-292-0104 and GS-US-292-0111 (N = 
841). 
Tenofovir AUCtau, Cmax, and Ctau in BVY-treated adolescents ≥ 35 kg were similar to those in adults. 
In children ≥ 25 kg, TFV AUCtau and Ctau were comparable to those in adult subjects in the Phase 3 
GEN studies. The difference in TFV Cmax (66% higher than in adults) was not deemed clinically 
relevant based on the favourable safety profile of Biktarvy and were within the range of safe exposures 
from historical data in adults for approved F/TAF-containing products. 
Predicted systemic exposures of TFV in children ≥ 2 years of age weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg receiving 
low dose BVY tablets (BIC/FTC/TAF 30/120/15 mg) were compared with those from GEN-treated, HIV-
1 infected adult subjects in the Phase 3 Studies GS-US-292-0104 and GS-US-292-0111 (N = 841) 
Tenofovir AUCtau and Ctau in BVY-treated children ≥ 2 years of age weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg were 
comparable to those in adults. The difference in TFV Cmax (37% higher than in adults) was not 
deemed clinically relevant based on the favourable safety profile of BIC/FTC/TAF, and was within the 
range of safe exposures from historical data in adults for approved F/TAF-containing products. 
Plasma concentrations of TFV were best described by a sequential 1-compartment TAF model and 2-
compartment TFV model with first-order elimination. A parallel absorption compartment with first-
order process was introduced in the model to describe TFV data in the presence of LPV/r (increase in F 
of 209.5%). The effects of WT on CLM/F, QM/F, VcM/F, and VpM/F were included using fixed allometric 
exponents of 0.75 and 1 for clearances and volumes of distribution, respectively. Baseline CLCRSW 
was found to significantly affect CLM/F. No additional covariates were found to significantly affect TFV 
exposure. 
TFV exposures were inversely correlated with WT, with percentage changes in TFV exposures ranging 
from −37.4% to +89.9% (relative to the median exposures) for subjects with extreme covariate 
values (ie, 5th and 95th WT percentiles, respectively). In addition, LPV/r and COBI were the most 
influential covariates with an increase in TFV exposures of +231% and +164%, respectively. Finally, 
the effect of baseline CLCRSW was a minimally influential covariate, with percentage changes in TFV 
exposures ranging from approximately −18.4% to +20.1% (relative to median exposures) for subjects 
with extreme covariate values (ie, 5th and 95th baseline CLCRSW percentiles, respectively). Based on 
the protocol-defined, boosted third agent- and WT-based dosing strategy, these changes in exposure 
have been appropriately accounted for. 
2.6.2.1.6.  Further PK analysis on BIC, TAF and TFV 
Body Weight 
• 
Baseline WT was included as a covariate on CL/F and Vz/F in the final PopPK models for BIC, TAF, and 
TFV. Consistent with the identified WT effect, exposures for BIC, TAF, and TFV were found to increase 
at decreasing WT.

Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate 
• 
- BIC and TAF 
Baseline CLCRSW was not identified as a statistically significant covariate for BIC and TAF PK in their 
respective final PopPK models. In paediatric subjects, BIC and TAF exposures were generally similar 
across the range of baseline CLCRSW values. 
- TFV 
Baseline CLCRSW was identified as a statistically significant covariate for TFV PK in the final PopPK 
model. This is as expected since TFV is renally eliminated. In paediatric subjects, TFV exposures were 
generally similar across the range of baseline CLCRSW values. 
These findings go in line with the adult population, although all paediatric HIV-1 infected subjects 
presented normal renal function. 
Gender 
• 
Gender was not considered a relevant covariate on the BIC, TAF and TFV popPK models and goes in 
line with previous findings in the adult population. 
Race 
• 
Race was identified as a statistically significant covariate for BIC and TAF PK in their respective final 
PopPK models once body size was accounted for. However, the limited sample sizes within each race 
category would prevent a robust quantification of the effects of race on BIC exposures. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
The primary and secondary pharmacology profile of Biktarvy has been previously established for 
adults. Pharmacodynamic interactions between Biktarvy or its individual component(s) and co-
administered medicinal products have only been performed in adults and no specific study in the 
paediatric population was submitted with the dossier for this application. 
During the assessment of this procedure, the MAH submitted however further PK/PD data to provide 
the quantitative description of the effect of Biktarvy on bone and renal toxicity. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Study GS-US-380-1474 evaluated the PK, safety, and efficacy of the adult-strength BVY tablet 
(BIC/FTC/TAF 50/200/25 mg) in virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected adolescents ≥ 12 to < 18 
years of age weighing ≥ 35 kg (Cohort 1) and children ≥ 6 to < 12 years of age weighing ≥ 25 kg 
(Cohort 2), and a low dose BVY tablet (BIC/FTC/TA F30/120/15 mg) in virologically suppressed HIV-1 
infected children ≥ 2 years of age weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg (Cohort 3). Intensive PK samples collected 
from the PK lead-in phase (Part A) of each cohort were used to estimate PK parameters for BIC, FTC, 
TAF and TFV.  
Two PopPK studies were presented: 
- The first considered a population pharmacokinetic analysis of bictegravir in HIV-1 infected 
adolescents and children and included data from study GS-US-380-1474 with 122 subjects from >2 to 
<18 years of age. Two fixed dose combination strengths were considered in the data. The model was 
developed based on a previously developed model and the addition of covariates was made by forward 
addition and backward deletion. The final model for BIC was a 1-compartment model with first-order

absorption with a lag time and linear elimination. Weight effects were included on CL/F and Vc/F using 
fixed allometric exponents of 0.75 and 1, respectively. The effect of proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) 
administration was added to ka and fixed to the value estimated in adults. In addition, Asian subjects 
were found to have lower CL/F (26.9% reduction) and Vc/F (27.2% reduction). Between-subject 
variability was included on CL/F and Vc/F and a combination of additive and proportional error model 
was used to characterize residual variability. The final model parameters were estimated with good 
confidence (%RSE <30%), presented low shrinkage (<15%) and were confirmed by bootstrapping. 
GOF plots were acceptable as well as the presented pcVPC (stratified by weight). 
- The second considered a population pharmacokinetic analysis of tenofovir alafenamide and tenofovir 
following administration of tenofovir alafenamide-containing–fixed-dose combinations in HIV-1-infected 
adolescents and children. Data was collected across various TAF-based regimens (Studies GS-US-292-
0106, GS-US-292-1515, GS-US-311-1269, and GS-US-380-1474) and was used to develop sequential 
PK model(s) of TAF and TFV in HIV-1-infected adolescents and children. Addition of covariates was 
again made by forward addition and backward deletion. The final paediatric TAF model, simplified from 
previous TAF PopPK analysis due to various reproducibility and robustness issues, was described by a 
1-compartment model with sequential zero- and first-order absorption and first-order elimination. 
Between-subject variability was included on the duration of zero-order absorption only and resulted in 
a high value of 108%. A combined error model was used to characterize residual variability, with the 
inclusion of between-subject variability on the proportional error term. Baseline WT effects were 
included on CL/F and Vc/F using fixed allometric exponents of 0.75 and 1, respectively. Cobicistat was 
found to affect relative bioavailability of TAF (163.6% increase), whereas lopinavir/ritonavir-boosted 
TAF was found to yield comparable exposure to unboosted TAF. In addition, TAF Vc/F was found to be 
lower in Asian subjects (-78.8% reduction). No additional covariates were found to significantly affect 
TAF exposure. The final model parameters were estimated with good confidence (%RSE <10%), 
presented low shrinkage (<25%) and were confirmed by bootstrapping. GOF plots were acceptable as 
well as the presented pcVPC (stratified by weight and by booster groups) although missing on the 
higher observed values and not entirely able to predict the values around Tmax. This was the result of 
several model simplifications that were made in order to achieve stability. The final paediatric 
sequential TAF-TFV model was described by the previous sequential 1-compartment TAF model and a 
2-compartment TFV model with first-order elimination was found to best describe the TFV paediatric 
data. A parallel absorption compartment with first-order process was introduced in the model to 
describe TFV data in the presence of the LPV/RTV booster. Between-subject variability was included on 
apparent oral clearance of TFV (CLM/F), apparent inter-compartmental clearance of TFV (QM/F), 
VcM/F, and apparent peripheral volume of distribution of TFV (VpM/F); and a combined proportional 
and additive error model was used to characterize the Residual Variability. The estimated LPV/RTV 
effect on TFV relative bioavailability (F) was 209.5% increase. Effects of WT were included on CLM/F, 
QM/F, VcM/F, and VpM/F using fixed allometric exponents of 0.75 and 1, for clearances and volumes of 
distribution, respectively. In addition, baseline creatinine clearance derived by Schwartz equation was 
found to significantly affect CLM/F. No additional covariates were found to significantly affect TAF 
exposure. Most of the final model parameters were estimated with good precision (%RSE <25%) and 
presented low shrinkage (<20%). Parameter were also confirmed by bootstrapping. GOF plots were 
acceptable as well as the presented pcVPC (stratified by weight and by booster groups). Overall, the 
popPK models was considered to be adequate for the purpose. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Data from Study GS-US-380-1474 in paediatric patients were presented and analysed to better 
characterise exposition in paediatric population.

Based on these PK data, no efficacy concern is expected for paediatric subjects.  
Population PK models were developed to characterize the exposures of BIC, TAF, and TFV in 
virologically suppressed adolescents and children ≥ 2 years of age weighing ≥ 14 kg in both the PK 
lead-in and treatment phases using all available intensive and sparse plasma concentration data. 
Population PK parameters of BIC, TAF, and TFV were predicted and also compared to historical PopPK 
data in HIV-1 infected adults. Results for BIC and TAF were generally similar to the ones obtained 
based on rich data and non-compartmental PK analysis. Overall, statistical comparisons of BIC, FTC, 
TAF, and TFV plasma PK parameters between children in Cohort 2 Part A and adolescent subjects in 
Cohort 1 Part A concluded that exposures in children of Cohort 2 Part A were, in general, higher than 
the adolescent subjects given that the children in Cohort 2 were from a lower weight band compared 
to the adolescents, and were administered the same dose as adolescents.  
Statistical comparisons of BIC, FTC, TAF, and TFV plasma PK parameters between children in Cohort 3 
Part A and adolescent subjects and children in Cohorts 1 and 2 Part A concluded that exposures were 
generally similar between children in Cohort 3 Part A and adolescents and children in Cohorts 1 and 2 
Part A, with less than 27% variation in geometric mean ratio.  
The PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis provides support for an advantageous safety profile for TAF, 
both unboosted and with a boosted third agent, compared with TDF in the paediatric population ≥ 2 
years of age weighing ≥ 14 kg.  
In general, the pharmacodynamics of Biktarvy have been sufficiently evaluated in the paediatric 
patients at least 2 years of age and weighing at least 14 kg. No major issues have been identified.  
The PK/PD data support the use of the low-dose Biktarvy tablet (BIC/FTC/TAF 30/120/15 mg) in 
paediatric patients ≥ 2 years of age weighing ≥14 to < 25 kg. 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.6.5.1.  Main study: GS-US-380-1474 
A Phase 2/3, Open-Label Study of the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Antiviral Activity of the GS-
9883/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir Alafenamide (GS-9883/F/TAF) Fixed Dose Combination (FDC) in HIV-1 
Infected Adolescents and Children 
This is an ongoing phase 2/3, open-label, multicenter, multicohort, single-arm study to evaluate the PK, 
safety,  tolerability,  and  antiviral  activity,  of  the  BIC/FTC/TAF  FDC  in  HIV-1  infected,  virologically 
supressed adolescent and children.  
Adolescents ≥ 12 to < 18 years of age weighing ≥ 35 kg (Cohort 1) and children ≥ 6 to < 12 years of 
age  weighing  ≥  25  kg  (Cohort  2)  received  1  adult-strength  BIC/FTC/TAF  50/200/25  mg  FDC  tablet, 
administered  orally,  once  daily,  at  approximately  the  same  time  each  day,  without  regard  to  food. 
Children ≥ 2 years of age weighing ≥ 14 kg (Cohort 3) received 1 low-dose BIC/FTC/TAF 30/120/15 mg 
FDC tablet, administered orally, once daily, at approximately the same time each day, without regard to 
food. For each cohort, the study was divided into Parts A and B. Subjects in Part A participated in an 
intensive PK evaluation at Week 2 or 4. Screening was initiated for Part B following confirmation of BIC 
PK and short-term safety data from Part A for each cohort. 
The PK, safety, and efficacy data presented here are from an interim analysis performed when all subjects 
in Cohort 1 Parts A and B, and Cohort 2 Parts A and B had completed their Week 96 visit, and all subjects 
in Cohort 3 Parts A and B had completed their Week 24 visit. Six subjects in Cohort 3 attained a weight

≥ 25 kg during the study and were switched to the adult-strength BIC/FTC/TAF 50/200/25 mg tablet (as 
appropriate for this weight band). Sensitivity analyses were performed in respect of the main efficacy 
endpoint (percentage of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Weeks 24 and 48 as defined 
by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-defined snapshot algorithm) and palatability/acceptability 
assessments, in which subjects who switched from the low-dose BIC/FTC/TAF 30/120/15 mg tablet to 
the  adult-strength  BIC/FTC/TAF  50/200/25  mg  tablet  by  virtue  of  having  attained  a  weight  ≥  25  kg 
during  the  main  phase  of  the  study  were  excluded  from  the  Full  and  Safety  Analysis  Sets  at  the 
appropriate time points. 
Study Participants 
Eligible subjects were HIV-1 infected adolescents (Cohort 1: ≥ 12 to < 18 years of age, weight ≥ 35 kg) 
and children (Cohort 2: ≥ 6 to < 12 years of age, weight ≥ 25 kg; Cohort 3: ≥ 2 years of age, weight ≥ 
14  to  <  25  kg)  virologically  suppressed  for  ≥  6  months  prior  to  screening  on  a  stable  antiretroviral 
regimen  comprising  2  nucleoside  reverse  transcriptase  inhibitors  plus  a  third  agent;  eGFR  ≥  90 
mL/min/1.73 m2 at screening; and no documented or suspected resistance to FTC, tenofovir or INSTI.

Outcomes/endpoints 
•  Efficacy endpoint: 
The efficacy endpoints for Cohorts 1 and 2 are as follows: 
- 
- 
- 
The proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Weeks 24 and 48 
as defined by the US FDA-defined snapshot algorithm; 
The change from baseline in CD4 cell counts and percentages at Weeks 24 and 48; 
The proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Weeks 24 and 48 
(missing = failure [M = F] and missing = excluded [M = E] analyses). 
The efficacy endpoints for Cohort 3 are as follows: 
- 
- 
- 
The proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Weeks 24 and 48 
as defined by the US FDA-defined snapshot algorithm; 
The change from baseline in CD4 cell count and percentage at Weeks 24 and 48; 
The proportion of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Weeks 24 and 48 (M = F 
and M = E analyses). 
•  Safety endpoint 
Evaluation of the safety and tolerability of the adult strength BIC/FTC/TAF FDC through Week 24 in 
HIV-1 infected, virologically suppressed adolescents (≥ 12 to < 18 years of age) and children (≥ 6 
to < 12 years of age). 
Data  are  derived  from  an  interim  analysis  performed  when  all  subjects  in  Cohorts  1  and  2  had 
completed their  Week  96 visit  and  all  subjects  in  Cohort  3 had  completed their  Week  24  visit,  or 
prematurely discontinued study drug. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
This is a non-randomized open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy analyses used the FAS, which included all subjects who were enrolled into the study and received 
at least 1 dose of study drug. The proportions of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at 
Weeks 24 and 48 were evaluated using both the US FDA defined snapshot algorithm and M = F and M 
=  E  analyses.  The  95%  CIs  for  these  percentages were  constructed  using  the  Clopper-Pearson  Exact 
method. 
The CD4 cell count and CD4% data, including change from baseline, were summarized using observed, 
on-treatment data (ie, data collected up to 1 day after permanent discontinuation of study drug or all 
available data for subjects who were still on study drug). 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 124 subjects were enrolled in the study: 
Cohorts 1 and 2 (Age ≥ 6 to < 18 Years and Weight ≥ 25 kg)

Of 116 subjects screened, 102 were enrolled, of whom 100 received study drug. At the data-cut date, 
99.0% (99 of 100) of treated subjects had completed study drug in the main (48-week) treatment phase 
and  had  entered  the  extension  phase.  One  subject  (1%)  prematurely  discontinued  study  drug  in  the 
main phase prior to the data-cut date because of an AE. At the data-cut date, 73 subjects were continuing 
to receive study drug, 22 subjects had completed the study, and 4 subjects had discontinued study drug 
(1 due to pregnancy, 1 following a parent/guardian decision, and 1 was lost to follow-up). 
Cohort 3 (≥ 2 years of age, and weight ≥ 14 to < 25 kg) 
Of 22 subjects screened, all were enrolled and received study drug. At the data-cut date, 54.5% (12 of 
22) of treated subjects had completed study drug in the main (48-week) treatment phase, and 45.5% 
(10 of 22) of subjects were continuing to receive study drug in the main phase. No subject prematurely 
discontinued study drug in the main phase. At the data-cut date, all 12 subjects who completed study 
drug in the main phase had entered the extension phase and were continuing to receive study drug. 
Conduct of the study 
Subjects were enrolled and treated by 24 investigators at a total of 22 study centers: 8 in South Africa, 
3 in Thailand, 1 in Uganda, and 10 in the United States (US). 
The protocol was amended 5 times during the course of Study GS-US-380-1474. 
•  Protocol deviations: 
Cohorts 1 and 2:  
A total of 59 important protocol deviations occurred in 36 subjects in Cohorts 1 and 2 during the 
study. Of the 36 subjects, 24 subjects had a single important deviation, 6 subjects had 2 important 
deviations, 4 subjects had 3 important deviations, 1 subject had 5 important deviations, and 1 had 
6  important  deviations.  The  most  common  important  protocol  deviations  were  for  a  treatment 
compliance issue. Of these 15 deviations, 9 deviations were for treatment compliance less than 70% 
between 2 scheduled study visits. None of these important protocol deviations affected the overall 
quality or interpretation of the study data. 
There were no important protocol deviations because of COVID-19 pandemic-related study disruption 
in Cohorts 1 and 2. None of the pandemic-related protocol deviations affected the overall quality or 
interpretation of the study data. 
Cohort 3:  
A total of 10 important protocol deviations occurred in 8 subjects during the study. Of the 8 
subjects, 6 subjects had a single important deviation and 2 subjects had 2 important deviations. 
Half of the important protocol deviations (5 of 10) were for missing data.  
• 
Adherence 
Cohort 1 and 2: 
The median adherence rates to study drug up to the Week 24 and 48 visits, and up to the data-cut date, 
were 98.8%, 98.6%, and 98.3%, respectively. The percentage of subjects with an adherence rate 
≥ 95% was 90.0% up to the Week 24 visit, 80.0% up to the Week 48 visit, and 82.0% up to the 
data-cut date.

Cohort 3: 
The median adherence rates to study drug up to the Week 24 and 48 visits and up to the data-cut date 
were 99.4%, 99.5%, and 99.4%, respectively. The percentage of subjects with an adherence rate 
≥ 95% was 86.4% up to the Week 24 visit, 83.3% up to the Week 48 visit, and 86.4% up to the 
data-cut date. 
Baseline data 
Subject Demographics and Baseline Disease Characteristics: 
In each 3 cohorts, ages and weights were rather well represented, including subjects with low 
age (12 years in cohort 1, 6 years in cohort 2, 3 years in cohort 3) and weight (35 kg in cohort 
1, 25 kg in cohort 2, 14 kg in cohort 3). Furthermore, in cohort 3, the heaviest subject weighed 
24 kg, i.e. the maximum weight limit for this cohort. 
Overall, paediatric subjects included in this study are well controlled under their current ARV, 
without advanced disease. The majority of the included subjects were asymptomatic. No subject 
had CD4 level <200/µl (>90% with CD4 level >500/µl) and >90% of them have asymptomatic 
disease. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Cohorts 1 and 2: 
Proportion of subjects with Plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at weeks 24 and 48: 
At Week 24, all subjects in both Cohort 1 (Parts A and B) and Cohort 2 (Parts A and B) in the 
FAS had HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL using the US FDA defined snapshot algorithm. 
At Week 48, percentages of subjects in the FAS with HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL using the US 
FDA-defined snapshot algorithm were as follows: 
Cohort 1 (Parts A and B): 98.0% (95% CI: 89.4% to 99.9%) 
Cohort 2 (Parts A and B): 98.0% (95% CI: 89.4% to 99.9%) 
Overall: 98.0% (95% CI: 93.0% to 99.8%) 
Using the Missing = Failure and Missing = Excluded imputation methods, the results at Week 24 
and Week 48 are as follows: 
M = F: Week 24, 100.0% (100 of 100 subjects); Week 48, 98.0% (98 of 100 subjects) 
M = E: Week 24: 100.0% (100 of 100 subjects); Week 48, 99.0% (98 of 99 subjects) 
Change from Baseline in CD4 Cell Counts and Percentages at Weeks 24 and 48: 
CD4  cell  counts  and  CD4%  were  maintained  through  Week  48.  Mean  (SD)  baseline  CD4  cell 
counts (FAS) were as follows: Cohort 1, 751 (224.4) cells/μL; Cohort 2, 930 (309.9) cells/μL. 
Mean (SD) changes from baseline in CD4 cell count were as follows: 
At Week 24: Cohort 1, 14 (190.4) cells/μL; Cohort 2, -24 (237.7) cells/μL 
At Week 48: Cohort 1, -22 (164.2) cells/μL; Cohort 2, -40 (158.8) cells/μL

Virology resistance analyses 
Of the 100 subjects in the FAS, 5 subjects (5.0%) in Cohort 1 (none in Cohort 2) met the VF and RAP 
inclusion criteria through Week 96. In Cohort 1, 4 of the 5 RAP subjects resuppressed HIV-1 RNA to < 
50 copies/mL while maintaining study drug, resulting in 1 subject in Cohort 1B being included in the 
final RAP. This subject had M184V, K103N, and Y188H at baseline and at VF, with no treatment-
emergent resistance to study drug.

In cohort 3, no subject was qualified for resistance testing. 
Acceptability/palatability 
In Cohorts 1 and 2, no subject reported dissatisfaction with either the palatability of the BIC/FTC/TAF 
tablet (“Product Taste Normal”) or its acceptability in terms of shape and size (“Acceptable Shape and 
Size”) at Baseline/Day 1 and Week 4. 
In Cohort 3, the majority of subjects had a neutral (“maybe good or maybe bad/could not taste it”) or 
positive (“good” or “super good”) palatability assessment at baseline (90.9%, 20 of 22 subjects) and 
Week  24  (89.5%,  17 of  19  subjects).  The  majority of  subjects  had  a  neutral or  positive  acceptability 
response for ease of swallowing, shape, and size when the study drug was swallowed whole at baseline, 
Weeks 4, 24, and 48: 
• 
In response to the question “How easy was it to swallow the study drug?”, the majority of subjects 
who swallowed the study drug whole reported “easy” or “super easy” (baseline: 82.4%, 14 of 17 
subjects; Week 4: 87.5%, 14 of 16 subjects; Week 24: 75.0%, 12 of 16 subjects; Week 48: 71.4%, 
5 of 7 subjects). 
• 
• 
In response to the question “How did the shape of the study drug feel when you swallowed it?”, the 
majority of subjects who swallowed the study drug whole reported “good” or “super good” (baseline: 
75.0%, 12 of 16 subjects; Week 4: 93.3%, 14 of 15 subjects; Week 24: 75.0%, 12 of 16 subjects; 
Week 48: 57.1%, 4 of 7 subjects). 
In response to the question “How did the size of the study drug feel when you swallowed it?”, the 
majority of subjects who swallowed the study drug whole reported “okay” (baseline: 88.2%, 15 of 
17  subjects;  Week  4:  86.7%,  13  of  15  subjects;  Week  24:  81.3%,  13  of  16  subjects;  Week  48: 
71.4%, 5 of 7 subjects).  
For those subjects who split the drug in half, all reported taking each half within 10 minutes (5 
subjects each at baseline and Week 4, 3 subjects at Week 24, and 1 subject at Week 48). 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Approximately one third of subjects had important protocol deviations, which is important, but no 
subject was excluded from study for such reasons. These protocol deviations did not raise concerns on 
the analysis of the results. 
In the 3 cohorts adherence was good, with a median adherence rates > 98% in the 3 cohorts, 80% of 
subjects with adherence ≥95% and no subject with adherence <80%. 
Ages and weights were rather well represented, including subjects with low age (12 years in cohort 1, 
6 years in cohort 2, 3 years in cohort 3) and weight (35 kg in cohort 1, 25 kg in cohort 2, 14 kg in 
cohort 3). Furthermore, in cohort 3, the heaviest subject weighed 24 kg, i.e., the maximum weight 
limit for this cohort. 
Overall, paediatric subjects included in this study are well controlled under their current ARV, without 
advanced disease. The majority of the included subjects were asymptomatic. No subject had CD4 level 
<200/µl (>90% with CD4 level >500/µl) and >90% of them have asymptomatic disease.  
Virological suppression was maintained in most of the enrolled subjects in each cohort as shown by the 
high proportion of subjects with plasma HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL at Weeks 24 and 48 using the US 
FDA-Defined Snapshot Algorithm or the Missing = Failure and Missing = Excluded Imputation Methods. 
CD4 cell counts and CD4% were maintained through Week 48 in each cohort. For cohorts 1 and 2, 
additional efficacy data at week 96 is available, showing maintenance of virological suppression and 
Assessment report on grouping of an extension of marketing authorisation and an 
extension of indication variation

Page 31/52 
 
 
 
CD4 cell counts and CD4%. In cohort 3, no subjects have experienced virological failure, and only one 
subject (1%) in cohorts 1-2 have HIV-1 RNA level >50 c/ml at Week 48. 
In conclusion, although efficacy results are secondary endpoints, these data are consistent with 
maintenance of the virological suppression on paediatric subjects treated with the proposed doses of 
Biktarvy. 
Viral resistance analysis indicates that overall, BIC/FTC/TAF was administered in 7 subjects with 
resistance-associated mutation (RAMs) at baseline: 5 subjects with primary NRTI-RAM (M184V) and 2 
subjects with primary INSTI-RAM (E92G, R263K). Five of 100 subjects (5.0%) in Cohort 1 had 
virological failure. Overall, there was no emergence of BIC, FTC or TFV RAM throughout study. The 
only one virologic failure of this study had already a FTC-RAM (M184V) at baseline without new 
emergence at virologic failure. 
The number of paediatric subjects with confirmed virologic failure during 96 weeks of treatment with 
Biktarvy has been low (5.0%) and only in Cohort 1.  
Considering the young age of subjects in cohort 3, the acceptability to swallow whole tablets is 
surprisingly good for such formulation, with only 1 subject/22 who finds it “hard” to swallow whole the 
tablet. However, it seems that 5 subjects have split the drug in half before intake, although it is 
specified is SmPC that “the tablets should not be chewed, crushed or split”. The MAH clarified that 
these 6 children (3 to 5 years old, weighing 15-20 kg) did split the paediatric tablet in half, with full 
adherence rate and without virological failure. Mean PK data available from 3 of these subjects who 
split the paediatric tablet are consistent with the mean exposures of BIC, FTC and TAF measured in the 
study GS-US-380-1474 in 22 subjects aged ≥2 years and weighing ≥14 to < 25 kg. However, PK data 
from only 3 subjects cannot be conclusive on the BIC, FTC and TAF exposures when tablets are split in 
half. 
Considering the high acceptability data from children who have taken the paediatric BIC/FTC/TAF 
tablets whole or split in half, and the film-coating that is not intended for PK properties (not a long-
acting tablet) but rather for taste purpose, language on the possibility to split the tablet in half to 
facilitate the intake has been added to the Product Information.  
2.6.7.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Although the efficacy data from the paediatric study were not primary endpoints, these data could be 
considered supportive. The study design (non-comparative, limited sample size) and the lack of 
efficacy data on ART-naïve paediatric subjects somewhat limited the interpretation of these results. 
Notably, paediatric subjects included in this study are well controlled under their current ARV, without 
advanced disease.  
However, more than 90% of paediatric subjects treated with Biktarvy (i.e., 100 subject weighing ≥25 
kg treated with Biktarvy 50/200/25 mg and 22 subjects ≥2 years of age and weighing 14 to <25 kg 
treated with Biktarvy 30/120/15 mg) have maintained their virologic suppression at Week 48. Based 
on efficacy analyses at Week 24 and Week 48 using the USFDA defined snapshot algorithm, the rates 
of virologic suppression (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) in the analysed samples were above 90% for 
Biktarvy, and high rates of virologic suppression were maintained beyond Week 48 in cohorts 1 and 2. 
There were no clinically relevant changes in CD4 cell counts and CD4%. No subjects developed 
treatment-emergent drug resistance substitutions in integrase or reverse transcriptase. Combined with 
PK data, these efficacy results support the use of Biktarvy in these paediatric population at the 
proposed doses.

2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
Cohort 1 and 2 
All 100 paediatric subjects ≥ 6 to < 18 years of age weighing ≥ 25 kg received at least 1 dose of study 
drug. At the data cut date, the median (Q1, Q3) exposure to study drug in Cohorts 1 and 2 was 151.4 
(125.6, 153.5) weeks. 
Cohort 3 
All 22 paediatric subjects ≥ 2 years of age weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg received at least 1 dose of study 
drug. At the data-cut date, the median (Q1, Q3) exposure in Cohort 3 to study drug was 54.9 (29.3, 
66.4) weeks. 
In Cohorts 1 and 2, most children received BIC/FTC/TAF for a duration ≥96 Weeks (97%). The 
percentage of children started to decrease significantly for a duration ≥ 132 Weeks. 
In Cohort 3, the duration of BIC/FTC/TAF was much more limited with a duration ≥24 Weeks in 95.5% 
of patients but only 54.5% of children received BIC/FTC/TAF for ≥36 Weeks. Therefore, the total 
exposure time to study drug was significantly lower in the younger population (cohort 3 - subjects ≥ 2 
years of age weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg). 
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
GS-US-380-1474 
Cohorts 1 and 2 
86.0% (86 of 100) of subjects (Cohort 1 84.0%, 42 of 50 subjects; Cohort 2 88.0%, 44 of 50 subjects) 
had at least 1 AE, the majority of which were Grade 1 or 2 in severity and considered not related to 
study drug.  
5 subjects had a Grade 3 or 4 AE (Cohort 1 8.0%, 4 of 50 subjects; Cohort 2 2.0%, 1 of 50 subjects), 
all considered not related to study drug. One subject, in Cohort 2, had an AE leading to premature 
study drug discontinuation that was considered related to study drug. No subject had a Stage 3, HIV-1 
related opportunistic illness reported during the study. 
Cohort 3 
77.3% (17 of 22) of subjects had at least 1 AE, the majority of which were Grade 1 in severity and not 
considered related to study drug. No subject had a Grade 3 or 4 AE, an SAE, or an AE leading to 
premature study drug discontinuation. One subject had a hepatic AE (Grade 1 abnormal faeces). No 
subject had a Stage 3, HIV-1 related opportunistic illness reported during the study.

 Cohorts 1 and 2 
Serious AEs were reported for 5.0% (5 of 100) of subjects in Cohorts 1 and 2; none was considered 
related to study drug. Appendicitis was reported in 2 subjects, 1 subject in Cohort 1 and 1 subject in 
Cohort 2. No other SAE was reported for > 1 subject. 
Cohorts 3 
No SAEs were reported in Cohort 3 through the data-cut date. 
2.6.8.4.  Treatment-Related Serious Adverse Events 
Cohorts 1 and 2 
Adverse events considered related to study drug were reported for 13.0% (13 of 100) of subjects in 
Cohorts 1 and 2. Among study drug-related AEs, only abdominal discomfort (3.0%, 3 subjects) was 
reported with greater than single subject incidence. In each case, the abdominal discomfort was Grade 
1 in severity and transient. 
Cohorts 3 
Adverse events considered related to study drug were reported for 13.6% (3 of 22) of subjects. Among 
study drug-related AEs, none was reported with greater than single subject incidence. 
2.6.8.5.  Laboratory findings 
Haematology and Chemistry Laboratory Values 
There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline in median values for haematology or clinical 
chemistry parameters. Median values were within the relevant reference ranges. 
In cohorts 1 and 2, most subjects (99%; 99 out of 100) experienced at least one laboratory 
abnormality. The maximum toxicity was grade 1 or 2 for 69%, grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities 
have been reported in 30% of subjects with the most frequent abnormality as haematuria (16 
haematuria grade 3 / 4) which have been reported in all but one case in adolescents and considered by 
the investigators as related to menses. The other laboratory abnormalities reported have been grade 
3/ 4 neutropenia (n= 7), amylase increased grade 3/ 4 (n= 3), hyperkalaemia grade 3 / 4 (n=2). 
In cohort 3, most subjects (95.5%, 21 out of 22) had at least one laboratory abnormality with a 
maximum toxicity grade 1 or 2 for 77.3% of subjects and grade 3 or 4 for 18.2% of subjects. The most 
common grade 3/ 4 laboratory abnormalities were decreased neutrophils (13.6%, 3 out of 22 
subjects). 
No subject met Hy’s Law criteria, defined as concurrent increases in aspartate aminotransferase (AST) 
or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) and total bilirubin > 2 x ULN with 
alkaline phosphatase < 2 x ULN and no alternative aetiology. There were no clinically relevant changes 
from baseline in median values for the liver-related laboratory parameters ALT, AST, alkaline 
phosphatase, or total bilirubin at Weeks 24, 48, 72, or 96. 
There were no clinically relevant changes from baseline in median fasting values for total cholesterol, 
direct low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, total 
cholesterol: HDL cholesterol ratio, triglycerides, or glucose at Weeks 24, 48, or 96.

48 were 0.07 (0.02, 0.09) and 0.06 (0.03, 0.15) mg/dL, respectively. A graded laboratory 
abnormality in serum creatinine was reported for 1 subject (4.5%, 1 of 22 subjects). This 
subject had a transient Grade 4 elevated serum creatinine that resolved 4 days later. 
-Corresponding to the results for serum creatinine, decreases from baseline in median values 
for eGFRSchwartz were observed at Week 1, stabilizing after Week 16. The median (Q1, Q3) 
baseline eGFRSchwartz value was 160.5 (145.0, 168.0) mL/min/1.73 m2. Median (Q1, Q3) 
changes from baseline in eGFRSchwartz at Weeks 24 and 48 were -19.0 (-24.0, 4.0) and -8.0 
(-38.0, -2.0) mL/min/1.73 m2, respectively.

Tanner stage Assessments 
In Cohorts 1 and 2, changes in Tanner stages for genitalia in males and breasts in female from 
baseline to96 were Weeks 24, 48 and 96 were consistent with the paediatric study population aged 6 
to <18 years. 
In Cohort 3, for subjects ≥6 years of age, changes in Tanner stages for genitalia in males and breasts 
in females from baseline to Weeks 24 and 48 were consistent with this paediatric population. 
Pregnancy 
Two pregnancies have been reported in subjects included in the Cohorts 1 and 2 through the cut-off 
date. One pregnancy resulted in a normal healthy baby and the other was reported as resolved without 
additional information about the outcome. 
2.6.9.  Safety in special populations 
Palatability and Acceptability of PFS Formulation in Paediatric Patients 
Palatability and acceptability were assessed to confirm the appropriateness of the adult strength. 
BIC/FTC/TAF 50/200/25 mg FDC tablet for use in adolescents (≥ 12 to < 18 years of age, weight ≥ 35 
kg) and children (≥ 6 to < 12 years of age, weight ≥ 25 kg), and the low-dose BIC/FTC/TAF 
30/120/15 mg FDC tablet for use in children ≥ 2 years of age, and weight ≥ 14 to < 25 kg. 
Cohorts 1 and 2 
No subject in Cohort 1 or 2 reported dissatisfaction with either the palatability of the 
BIC/FTC/TAF tablet (“Product Taste Normal”) or its acceptability in terms of shape and size 
(“Acceptable Shape and Size”) at Baseline/Day 1 and Week 4. 
Cohort 3 
In Cohort 3, the majority of subjects had a neutral (“maybe good or maybe bad/could not taste 
it”) or positive (“good” or “super good”) palatability assessment at baseline (90.9%, 20 of 22 
subjects) and Week 24 (89.5%, 17 of 19 subjects). 
The majority of subjects had a neutral or positive acceptability response for ease of swallowing, shape, 
and size when the study drug was swallowed whole at baseline, Weeks 4, 24, and 48. 
2.6.10.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug-drug interactions  
There is low potential for BIC/FTC/TAF to cause drug-drug interactions (DDIs). 
Because no PK enhancer such as COBI or RTV is required to maintain BIC plasma concentrations, the 
DDI potential of BIC/FTC/TAF is lower than that of other approved agents. The reduced risk of DDIs is 
an important benefit in the maintenance of treatment adherence in a paediatric population.

2.6.13.  Long-term safety profile of Biktarvy 
Three studies have investigated F/TAF-containing regimens in the paediatric population:  
1.  Biktarvy 
(BIC/FTC/TAF) 
(Study  GS-US-380-1474) 
in  children/adolescents  with  human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection ≥ 2 to < 18 years of age weighing ≥ 14 kg  
2.  Elvitegravir  [E]/cobicistat  (C)/F/TAF  (Study  GS-US-292-0106)  in  children/adolescents  with  HIV 
infection ≥ 2 to < 18 years of age weighing ≥ 14 kg  
3.  F/TAF) with a third agent (Study GS-US-311-1269) in children/adolescents with HIV infection ≥ 2 to 
< 18 years weighing ≥ 17 kg  
Additionally, two studies evaluated TDF-containing regimens in the paediatric population: 
4.  TDF  (switched  from  a  zidovudine  -  or  stavudine-containing  regimen)  with  existing  antiretroviral 
(ARV) regimen (Study GS-US-104-0352) in children with HIV infection ≥ 2 to < 16 years of age  
5.  TDF (Study GS-US-174-0144) in children ≥ 2 to < 12 years of age with hepatitis B (HBV) infection 
These studies concern different levels of tenofovir exposure and duration of tenofovir exposure (median 
exposure of 193 weeks with Biktarvy for 6-12 years and 99 weeks for 2-6 years versus 330 weeks with 
TDF in GS-US-104-0352 study). 
- Renal Safety in Paediatric Participants Receiving BIC/FTC/TAF and F/TAF-Containing Regimens 
Among  participants  receiving  BIC/FTC/TAF  in  Study  GS-US-380-1474,  as  well  as  those  receiving 
E/C/F/TAF  in  Study  GS-US-292-0106  and  F/TAF  in  Study  GS-US-311-1269,  median  values  for  serum 
creatinine in each cohort increased from Week 1, with a corresponding decrease in glomerular filtration 
rate as estimated by the Schwartz equation (eGFRSchwartz). The decrease in eGFRSchwartz with an F/TAF-
containing regimen was similar or lower than that seen with a TDF-based regimen 
Serum creatinine values for participants in all age and weight cohorts in all 3 studies evaluating TAF-
based regimens at all visits were within the normal range for age, apart from 3 transient exceptions, and 
the changes over time were not considered clinically significant. The increases observed are consistent 
with the physiological increase of serum creatinine with increasing age. Of note, larger median increases 
observed  at  later  visits  in  participants  ≥ 6 years  of  age  in  Studies  GS-US-380-1474  and  GS-US-292-
0106 may reflect that the increase in serum creatinine is steeper in adolescence, especially in boys, as 
some study participants would have reached adolescence during the long-term follow-up.  
The increases in serum creatinine in Study GS-US-380-1474 are also consistent with the known inhibitory 
effect  of  BIC  on  renal  creatinine  transporters,  which  contributes  to  a  decrease  in  tubular  secretion  of

extension of indication variation

creatinine and consequent increase in serum creatine. Inhibition of renal creatinine transporters by BIC 
has previously been shown not to impact glomerular function as demonstrated by an absence of change 
in the actual glomerular filtration rate measured by iohexol clearance in adults (Study GS-US-141-1487). 
3 of 291 participants in these 3 studies had isolated, transient graded serum creatinine laboratory values. 
Only 1 participant had a  Grade 3 or 4 serum creatinine value, which was within the normal range on 
repeat 4 days later.  
The incidence of adverse events (AEs) in the Renal and Urinary Disorders system organ class (SOC) was 
low in each of the 3 studies. No AE related to renal function led to permanent study drug discontinuation. 
No AE of renal tubulopathy was reported in any of these studies. In contrast, in Study GS-US-104-0352, 
16 participants (3 ≥ 12 years of age, 12 ≥ 6 to < 12 years of age, and 1 < 6 years of age) met the 
laboratory  and  clinical  definition  of  proximal  renal  tubulopathy,  which  led  to  TDF  discontinuation  in 
4 participants. 
The clinical relevance of changes in renal biomarkers in TAF-containing regimens compared with TDF-
containing regimens has been evaluated in a pooled analysis of safety data from 26 studies with TAF- or 
TDF-containing regimens. The analysis included 9332 adults and children with HIV, with TAF exposure 
of 12519 person years and TDF exposure of 5947 person years. There were no cases of proximal renal 
tubulopathy in the TAF group compared with 10 cases in the TDF group, and fewer participants in the 
TAF group (3 of 6360) discontinued study treatment due to renal AEs than in the TDF group (14 of 2962). 
Changes in renal biomarkers, including serum creatinine and creatinine clearance calculated using the 
Cockcroft-Gault equation were seen in both groups but were smaller in those taking TAF (i.e., with lower 
TFV exposures than in those taking TDF), supporting the contention that the changes observed in these 
biomarkers with TAF-containing regimens do not translate to clinically relevant outcomes.  
- Bone Safety in Paediatric Participants Receiving BIC/FTC/TAF or F/TAF-Containing Regimens 
Bone  mineral  density  (BMD)  was  assessed  in  paediatric  participants  receiving  E/C/F/TAF  in  Study 
GS-US-292-0106  and  F/TAF  in  Study  GS-US-311-1269  with  dual-energy  x-ray  absorptiometry  (DXA) 
scans at Weeks 24 and 48, and then every 48 or 24 weeks, in the respective studies.  
Median spine and total-body-less-head (TBLH)  BMD values for children ≥ 6 to < 12 years of  age and 
weighing ≥ 25 kg in Cohort 2 in Study GS-US-292-0106 increased at each study visit through Week 240. 
Height  and  age  (HA)  BMD  Z-scores  did  not  change  notably  from  baseline,  indicating  that  subjects 
mineralized bone at rates consistent with those of the reference population. Changes in spine and TBLH 
HA  BMD  Z-scores  observed  in  studies  of  TAF-containing  regimens  were  similar  or  smaller  than  those 
observed in studies evaluating with a TDF-containing regimen. 
It is important to consider these median changes in the context of any decreases ≥ 4% in BMD and/or 
shifts in an HA BMD Z-score from > −2 to ≤ −2 in individual participants, as well as other potentially 
confounding  factors.  Overall,  in  Cohort 2  of  Study  GS-US-292-0106,  10 of  50 participants  had  a 
≥ 4% decrease in spine BMD at some time point; 3 of these 10 participants plus 1 additional participant 
had a ≥ 4% decrease in TBLH BMD at some time point. Of note, 9 of the 11 participants with a ≥ 4% 
decrease in either spine or TBLH BMD were enrolled at a single site; despite concerns about site-specific 
issues,  investigations  at  the  site  identified  no  technical  issues  with  the  DXA  scanner  or  with  the 
performance of the DXA procedures. The spine is rich in metabolically active trabecular bone, and deficits 
after exposure to antiretroviral drugs are most readily apparent early in a treatment protocol. The largest 
percentage  of  participants  exhibiting  a  ≥ 4%  decrease 
in  spine  BMD  was  at  Week 24 
(10 of 50 participants  [20%]);  at  subsequent  visits,  a  smaller  percentage  of  participants  met  this 
threshold decline (6 of 39 participants [15.4%] at Week 144; 1 of 17 participants [5.9%] at Week 192; 
and 0 of 9 participants at Week 240). Similarly, the percentage of participants with a ≥ 4% decrease in 
TBLH BMD ranged from 3.9% to 5.8% at Weeks 24 through 96, with no participant meeting this threshold

in this cortical bone-rich site from Weeks 144 through 240. At their most recent DXA assessment, 5 of 
50 (10%)  participants  showed  a  ≥ 4%  decrease  in spine  BMD,  while  none  showed  a  decrease of  this 
magnitude in TBLH BMD. Only 1 of the 5 participants who had a decrease from baseline in spine BMD 
≥ 4% at their last visit had a clinical shift in HA BMD Z-score from > −2 to ≤ −2; this participant had 
no associated AE. 
Intensive pharmacokinetic (iPK) sampling was conducted in a subset of participants enrolled in Study 
GS-US-292-0106. Based on AUCtau and Cmax, TFV exposures were similar in Cohort 2 participants with 
and without a ≥ 4% decrease in spine BMD, although numbers of participants were small. Consequently, 
the BMD changes do not appear to be dependent on TFV exposure.  
The diagnosis of osteoporosis and osteopenia in children is appropriate only when both low bone mass 
(BMD Z-score ≤ −2) and a clinically significant fracture history are present. In Cohort 2 of Study GS-
US-292-0106, 2 female participants, respectively, each had a traumatic bone fracture, neither of which 
was considered related to study drug by the investigator. Spine and TBLH BMD progressively increased 
from baseline in both participants, and neither had a shift in spine or TBLH BMD HA Z-scores from > −2 
to ≤ −2 at any time.  
In children ≥ 2 years of age weighing ≥ 14 to <25 kg (n = 27) in Cohort 3 in Study GS-US-292-0106, 
no initial decrease in spine or TBLH HA BMD Z-scores was observed; median changes from baseline at 
Week 48 were 0.14 and −0.06, respectively. Two participants in Cohort 3 had a decrease ≥ 4% in spine 
BMD at 1 or more time points and one of these 2 participants also had a decrease ≥ 4% in TBLH BMD; 
neither had a shift in HA BMD Z-score from > −2 to ≤ −2. 
Although the number of participants is smaller, BMD data obtained from Study GS-US-311-1269 also 
support the long-term safety of TAF-containing products in children < 12 years of age. Median spine and 
TBLH HA BMD and Z-scores improved or remained stable through a median of up to 113.1 weeks. No 
participant in Study GS-US-311-1269 had a decrease in BMD ≥ 4% at any time point. Three participants 
(2 in Cohort 1 and 1 in Cohort 2) had postbaseline shifts in spine or TBLH HA BMD Z-scores from > −2 
to ≤ −2; an AE of decreased bone density was reported for 1 of the 3 participants.  
Median decreases in HA BMD Z-scores were similar or smaller in Studies GS-US-292-0106 and GS-US-
311-1269  (F/TAF-based  regimen)  studies  than  in  Study  GS-US-104-0352  (TDF-based  regimen)  in 
children ≥ 6 to < 12 years of age, consistent with what was observed at Week 48. These observations 
are notable as the participants taking boosted third agents in Study GS-US-311-1269 had increased TFV 
exposures relative to those taking BIC/FTC/TAF in Study GS-US-380-1474. 
Assessing the impact of TFV exposure on bone health is challenging as a deficit in bone mineralization is 
common  in  children  with  HIV  receiving  ARV  drugs,  and  is  likely  multifactorial,  including  local 
socioeconomic  conditions,  HIV  infection,  chronic  immune  host  activation,  and  the  nature  of  the  ARV 
drugs administered. A number of studies have reported the association of older ARV drugs, especially 
protease  inhibitors  such  as  lopinavir  and  atazanavir,  with  increased  bone  turnover,  accelerated  bone 
loss,  and  a  higher  prevalence  of  decreased  BMD.  In  addition,  longitudinal  assessments  of  changes  in 
bone health in children with HIV and the link to clinical outcomes are limited. Nonetheless, the overall 
increases  in  BMD  values  observed  in  study  participants  ≥  6  to  < 12 years  old  receiving  F/TAF  or 
E/C/F/TAF are consistent with a rate of mineralization expected for children with HIV in this age range. 
Biomarkers of bone formation (such as osteocalcin, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase, procollagen type 
I N-terminal propeptide) and resorption (such as N-telopeptide, C-telopeptide), as well as parathyroid 
hormone,  25-OH  vitamin  D,  and  1,25-OH2 vitamin  D  were  assessed  in  the  TAF  and  TDF  studies.  In 
general,  in  participants  <  12  years  of  age,  the  serum  markers  were  stable  or  increased,  and  were 
consistent  with  reference  ranges  for  this  age  group,  where  available.  Interpretation  of  bone  turnover 
markers is confounded by intrasubject as well as inter-subject variability; variability is related to factors

such as seasonality, circadian rhythm, fasting, physical activity, menstruation, age, sex, ethnicity, and 
vitamin D deficiency. Serum 25-OH vitamin D was stable or decreased, while serum 1,25-OH2 vitamin D 
increased over time. Vitamin D deficiency is common globally, independent of HIV status or treatment. 
Bone fractures were uncommon in all the studies described here and, importantly, the bone fractures 
identified, including in Study GS-US-380-1474, were the result of trauma and not considered related to 
study drug. 
Data on longer term effects of TAF- and TDF-containing regimens on bone health is available from adults. 
In an integrated analysis of the safety and efficacy of TAF vs TDF for ART initiation or switch in women 
in 7 studies, women initiating or switching to TAF had significantly improved hip and spine BMD compared 
to  women  taking  TDF  after  2  years  of  treatment.  Five-year  outcomes  from  2 phase 3  studies  with 
BIC/FTC/TAF in treatment-naive adults showed mean (standard deviation) % changes in spine and hip 
were -0.29% (5.29) and -0.23% (5.16), respectively, through Week 240 (data on file). On Week 240 
DXA scans in this BIC/FTC/TAF study, 9 of 144 (6.3%) participants with normal spine BMD at Baseline 
had  osteopenia  and  none  had  osteoporosis,  while  5  of  50  (10%)  participants  and  2  of  50  (4.0%) 
participants  who  had  osteopenia  at  baseline  had  improved  to  normal  or  had  worse  classification  of 
osteoporosis, respectively. Among 7 participants with osteoporosis at Baseline BMD, 1 had a normal BMD 
value and 2 had BMD values consistent with osteopenia (n=2) at Week 240. 
Growth  and  Development in  Paediatric  Participants  Receiving  BIC/FTC/TAF  or  Other  F/TAF-Containing 
Regimens 
No impairment of growth or development was observed among participants in any of studies GS-US-
380-1474, GS-US-292-0106, and GS-US-311-1269 in which participants received B/FTAF, E/C/F/TAF, or 
F/TAF, respectively. Overall, the study participants gained height and weight as would be expected over 
time, and Z-scores increased. No impact on normal development, as assessed by Tanner stage changes, 
was noted in participants in any of the studies, including in participants who entered puberty during the 
course of the studies. 
In summary, the above-described long-term safety data in children who received the BIC/FTC/TAF LDT 
and in children who received the adult strength BIC/FTC/TAF tablet in Study GS-US-380-1474, combined 
with  aggregate  data  of  children  receiving  other  F/TAF-containing  regimens  (F/TAF  in  Study 
GS-US-311-1269  and  E/C/F/TAF  in  Study  GS-US-292-0106),  reinforces  the  safety  of  BIC/FTC/TAF  in 
terms of renal function, bone development and growth in this age group. 
2.6.14.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In Cohorts 1 and 2, i.e., in children age ≥6 years <12 years weight ≥25 kg (cohort 2) and ≥12 years to 
<18 years weight ≥35 kg (cohort 1) (n=100) the most commonly reported AEs were upper respiratory 
tract infection, cough, diarrhoea, headache, and nasopharyngitis. The overall types of common AEs were 
consistent  with  those  expected  in  the  study  population.  Some  AEs  such  as  vomiting  (8%),  arthralgia 
(6%),  rash  (6%)  abdominal  pain  (5%)  and  anxiety  (5%)  consider  as  “uncommon”  might  have  been 
more frequently reported in children compared to what was reported in adults. However, considering the 
design of the study, open label, no further conclusions can be made. Most AEs reported were grade 1 or 
2.  Four AEs grade 3 or 4 and 5 SAEs have been reported but none have been considered as related. No 
deaths have been reported. 
Among study drug-related AEs, only abdominal discomfort grade 1 has been reported with greater than 
single subject incidence (n=3). Half of the AE reported are listed in the section ADR of Biktarvy SmPC. 
No new safety issue has been identified. No hepatic AE was reported in any subject, neither any Hy’s 
law case.

Most subjects had no graded liver-related laboratory abnormality, and those that were reported were 
mostly Grade 1; 1 subject, in Cohort 2, had a Grade 3 increased AST and a Grade 4 increased ALT that 
resolved while on study drug. There were no Grade 4 liver-related laboratory abnormalities reported. No 
subject met Hy’s Law criteria. 
Increases in serum creatinine and decreases in eGFR Schwartz were observed, consistent with the known 
inhibitory effect of BIC on renal creatinine transporters (organic cation transporter 2 and multidrug and 
toxin  extrusion  1),  which  contributes  to  a  decrease  in  tubular  secretion  of  creatinine,  resulting  in  an 
increase in serum creatinine. These changes in serum creatinine were observed from Week 1 and through 
Week 96, and remained within the normal range for this population, and changes in eGFR Schwartz were 
observed  at  Week  1,  stabilizing  after  Week  12  through  Week  96.  Inhibition  of  these  renal  creatinine 
transporters by BIC has previously been shown not to impact glomerular function as demonstrated by 
an absence of change in actual glomerular filtration rate measured by iohexol clearance in adults (Study 
GS-US-141-1487).  
Switching to BIC/FTC/TAF was overall well tolerated by virologically suppressed paediatric subjects ≥ 6 
to  <  18  years  of  age  through  a  median  duration  of  exposure  of  151.4  weeks.    Only  one  subject 
discontinued study drug twice due to an AE, once because of insomnia and the second time because of 
anxiety. Both AEs are listed in the Biktarvy SmPC.  
In Cohort 3 i.e., in children age ≥2  years to <6 years weighing ≥14 kg to  <25 kg (n=22), the most 
commonly reported AEs were upper respiratory tract infection, cough, nasopharyngitis, and vomiting. 
The overall types of common AEs were consistent with those expected in the study population. Most AEs 
reported  were  grade  1  or  2.    No  Grade  3  or  4  AE,  SAE  and  deaths  have  been  reported.  No  subjects 
discontinued the study due to AE in this cohort. One subject had a hepatic AE (Grade 1 abnormal faeces) 
that was considered not related to study drug. One case of Grade 4 elevated serum creatinine has been 
reported  in  Cohort  3.  The  AE  was  transient  and  resolved  4  days  later.  There  have  been  no  renal 
tubulopathy (including Fanconi syndrome) reported. 
Among  study  drug-related  AEs,  none  was  reported  in  more  than  one  subject.  Most  AEs  reported  are 
listed in section 4.8 of the Biktarvy SmPC.  
No  safety  issue  was  identified  regarding  laboratory  abnormalities.  Increases  from  baseline  in  median 
values for serum creatinine were observed by Week 4 and stabilized after Week 8. The median (Q1, Q3) 
change  from  baseline  in  serum  creatinine  at  Week  48  was  0.06  (0.03,  0.15)  mg/dL.  Corresponding 
decreases from baseline in median values for eGFR Schwartz were observed at Week 1, stabilizing after 
Week  16.  Inhibition  of  these  renal  creatinine  transporters  by  BIC  has  previously  been  shown  not  to 
impact glomerular function as demonstrated by an absence of change in actual glomerular filtration rate 
measured by iohexol clearance in adults (Study GS-US-141-1487).  
Switching to BIC/FTC/TAF appeared to be well tolerated by virologically suppressed paediatric subjects 
≥ 2 years of age (weighing ≥ 14 kg to < 25 kg). However, safety data have been gathered in a very 
limited number of patients (n=22) and for a limited duration of exposure duration (duration ≥24 Weeks 
in  95.5%  of  patients  but  only  54.5%  of  children  received  BIC/FTC/TAF  for  ≥36  Weeks).  Taking  into 
account  the  increased  TFV  exposure  in  subjects  <12  years  old  compared  to  adults,  the  MAH  was 
requested  by  the  CHMP  to  further  discuss  the  risk  of  renal  and  bone  toxicity  associated  to  long-term 
overexposure to TAF with Biktarvy.  
Therefore,  the  MAH  provided  renal,  bone  and  growth  safety  data  from  pooled  studies  conducted  in 
paediatric patients aged from 2 to 12 years based on different studies conducted in paediatric patients 
exposed to either TAF-containing regimens (studies GS-US-380-1474 with Biktarvy, GS-US-292-0106 
with Elvitegravir [E]/cobicistat (C)/F/TAF and GS-US-311-1269 with F/TAF) or TDF-containing regimens 
(studies GS-US-104-0352 with TDF for HIV infection and GS-US-174-0144 with TDF for B viral hepatitis).

These data did not identify any new safety concerns. The CHMP noted that a warning on the possible 
nephrotoxicity after prolonged exposure to TAF had been recently added to the Product Information for 
Biktarvy (and all TAF-containing products). This wording also applies to the paediatric population and 
therefore adequately covers for this paediatric extension.  
Regarding bone toxicity, it is not possible to draw any firm conclusion on the potential impact on growing 
bones after prolonged exposure to tenofovir even at low dose and particularly for children aged ≥2 <6 
years because of the limited amount of safety data available in this age group and the limited duration 
of exposure to tenofovir. Notably, Biktarvy will be the first TAF-containing regimen to be authorized in 
the  age  group  ≥2  <6  years  in  the  EU.  For  these  reasons,  as  part  of  this  procedure,  the  safety 
specifications of the Biktarvy RMP were updated to include as “missing information” - “Long term safety 
in children aged between ≥ 2 and < 6 years”. Additionally, a warning on the potential long-term bone 
toxicity of TAF on growing bone was added to sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the Biktarvy SmPC.  
Overall, 2 pregnancies exposed to Biktarvy have been reported in the GS-US-380-1474 study. One of 
the 2 pregnancies resulted in a normal healthy baby and the other was reported as “resolved without 
additional information about the outcome”.  
In all cohorts no impact on height, body weight and Tanner stage has been identified.  
Overall safety data is reassuring with no significant AEs in severity and number. Most AEs were mild and 
in  line  with  what  was  expected  for  the  age  of  the  study  population.  No  new  clinically  relevant  safety 
signals have been identified with the administration of adult or reduced dose to both Cohort 1/2 and 3. 
Laboratory changes were also non relevant and in line with what expected for this class of medicines. 
However, the exposure time for the younger cohort 3 is significantly lower compared to the older one. 
The  available  PK  data  from  study  GS-US-380-1474  showed  higher  exposure  to  emtricitabine  and 
tenofovir  disoproxil.  For  emtricitabine,  this  overexposure  might  be  associated  to  more  side  effects, 
notably GI, hepatic and haematologic disorders. No safety data suggesting FTC overexposure have been 
reported in patients <12 years of age despite limited data numerically gathered notably in HIV-infected 
patients <6 years. For tenofovir alafenamide, long-term data on exposure to another different FDC of 
elvitegravir 
/cobicistat 
/emtricitabine 
/ 
tenofovir 
alafenamide 
rather 
than 
bictegravir/emtricitabine/tenofovir  alafenamide  were  provided.  The  main  purpose  of  the  open-label 
multicenter single-group study conducted in 102 HIV-1 infected patients ≥ 6 to < 18 years of age was 
to demonstrate long-term safety for EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF co-formulated both on renal function and bone 
mineral density / fracture risk. In this study, the impact of long-term treatment on renal function and 
bone density/fracture risk seems to be acceptable. Some cases with significant decrease in bone mineral 
density  (BMD  Z-score)  without  impact  (i.e.,  fracture)  have  been  reported.  And  compared  to  the 
formulation subject of approval the FDC used in this long-term study (EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF co-formulated) 
has a lower TAF dose (10mg instead of 25/15mg for Biktarvy). 
2.6.15.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The analysis of safety data in support of this application (mainly from the ongoing study GS-US-380-
1474) has shown that the overall safety profile of Biktarvy in the paediatric population is acceptable for 
the target population and it is comparable to its safety in adults. The additional long-term safety data 
provided as part of the responses to CHMP confirmed this conclusion. 
Renal, bone and growth safety data from pooled studies conducted in paediatric patients aged from 2 to 
12  years  based  on  other  studies  conducted  in  paediatric  patients  exposed  to  either  TAF-containing 
regimens or TDF-containing regimens did not identify any new safety concerns.

Regarding  bone  toxicity,  it  was  not  possible  to  draw  any  firm  conclusion  on  the  potential  impact  on 
growing bones after prolonged exposure to tenofovir even at low dose and particularly for children aged 
≥2 <6 years because of the limited amount of safety data available in this age group and the limited 
duration of exposure to tenofovir. Therefore, the RMP safety specifications of Biktarvy were updated to 
include “Long term safety in children aged between ≥ 2 and < 6 years” as “missing information” and 
language on the potential long-term bone toxicity of TAF on growing bone was added to sections 4.4 and 
4.8 of the SmPC.

Summary of the risk management plan 
The public summary of the RMP has been adequately revised in line with other sections throughout the 
RMP. 
2.7.4.  Conclusion 
Risk management plan version 4.0 is acceptable and approved with this procedure. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the MAH fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.9.  Product information 
Sections 1, 2, 3, 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.6, 4.7, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 6.1, 6.5 and 8 of the SmPC are updated as part

of this procedure. Sections 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 of the Package Leaflet have been updated accordingly. 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet was submitted by the MAH, which was acceptable. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Biktarvy (bictegravir / emtricitabine / 
tenofovir alafenamide) is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active 
substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The global burden of HIV and the specific paediatric challenges are well-known. In 2018, 160,000 
(110,000–260,000) children aged 0-14 acquired HIV infection globally. In the Western and Central 
Europe and North America region, the estimated number of children living with HIV in 2013 was 2,800 
(2,300–3,600), and it is estimated that over 95% of these children were receiving antiretroviral 
therapy.  
Globally, deaths among children younger than 15 years of age are reported to be declining. At the end 
of 2018, an estimated 100,000 (64,000–160,000) children aged 0-14 years had died from AIDS- 
related causes, representing 52% fewer deaths in this age group than in 2012. In North America, 
Western and Central Europe, fewer than 200 children died from AIDS-related illnesses in 2012. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The current INSTI-based ARV indicated in paediatric subjects are as follows: 
- Dolutegravir: available as dispersible tablets and film-coated tablets, indicated in children ≥ 4 weeks 
of age and weighing ≥3 kg. 
- Dolutegravir/lamivudine (DTG/3TC): available as film-coated tablets, indicated in adolescents ≥ 12 
years of age and weighing ≥40 kg. 
- Elvitegravir/cobicistat/FTC/TAF (Elvitegravir/Cobicistat/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir alafenamide): 
available as film-coated tablet, indicated in children ≥6 years old and weighing ≥25 kg for whom 
alternative regimens are unsuitable due to toxicities. 
Assessment report on grouping of an extension of marketing authorisation and an 
extension of indication variation  
EMA/807473/2022  
Page 47/52 
 
 
 
- Raltegravir: available as granules for oral suspension and chewable tablets, indicated in children 
weighing ≥3 kg. 
A once daily, single-tablet regimen (STR) has been shown to significantly improve adherence, 
treatment satisfaction, and virologic outcome for patients infected with HIV-1. Six STRs are currently 
approved in the EU for once daily administration in the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adolescents 
(≥12 years old): EVG/COBI/FTC/TDF (elvitegravir/cobicistat/FTC/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate), 
EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF (elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide co-formulated), 
abacavir/dolutegravir/lamivudine, FTC/rilpivirine/TAF (FTC/RPV/TAF), 
darunavir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (DRV/COBI/FTC/TAF) and 
dolutegravir/lamivudine  (DTG/3TC). EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF tablets is the only once daily STR approved in 
children. 
In adults, BIC/FTC/TAF did not respond to an unmet medical need. However, BIC/FTC/TAF may 
provide an improved option for paediatric patients for whom it would be better to avoid the potential 
for adverse reactions arising from less tolerated agents such as ritonavir (RTV)-boosted protease 
inhibitors or central nervous system adverse events (AEs) due to EFV. Additionally, as BIC, FTC, and 
TAF are not clinically relevant inhibitors or inducers of major human drug-metabolizing enzymes or 
transporters, there is low potential for BIC/FTC/TAF to cause drug-drug interactions (DDIs). Because 
no PK enhancer such as COBI or RTV is required to maintain BIC plasma concentrations, the DDI 
potential of BIC/FTC/TAF is lower than that of other approved agents. The reduced risk of DDIs is an 
important benefit in the maintenance of treatment adherence in a paediatric population. Moreover, a 
TAF-containing regimen would be a better choice than a TDF based regimen in this population due to a 
more favourable bone and renal profile. The small tablet size of the low-dose BIC/FTC/TAF FDC is 
expected to provide a further benefit for paediatric patients for whom pill swallowing can be a barrier 
to treatment compliance. 
In conclusion, BIC/FTC/TAF can be regarded as an alternative treatment that has a potential benefit in 
children. Not only because it may improve adherence but also because it has less potential to DDI and 
a more favourable bone and renal profile. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This paediatric extension is based on the study GS-US-380-1474. This is an ongoing Phase 2/3 study 
to evaluate PK, safety, tolerability, and antiviral activity of the BIC/FTC/TAF FDC in HIV-1 infected, 
virologically suppressed paediatric subjects. This study enrolled children in age and weight-defined 
cohorts (Cohort 1: ≥ 12 to < 18 years of age weighing ≥ 35 kg; Cohort 2: ≥ 6 to < 12 years of age 
weighing ≥ 25 kg; Cohort 3: ≥ 2 years of age weighing ≥ 14 to < 25 kg). Subjects from Cohort 3 
received a specific low-dose BIC/FTC/TAF tablet. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Overall, no clinically relevant differences in BIC exposure parameters were observed in adolescents or 
children ≥ 2 years of age and weighing ≥ 14 kg. FTC and TFV exposures were higher than in adults but 
were within the safe and efficacious ranges established in the Biktarvy and EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF co-
formulated programs. Based on PK data, no lack of efficacy associated to a lower BIC, FTC or TAF 
exposure is expected. 
At Week 24 and Week 48, high rates of virologic suppression (>90%) were observed in these 
virologically-suppressed paediatric subjects, and CD4 cell counts remained stable. No subject had 
treatment-emergent resistance to study drug. Although the efficacy data from this paediatric study 
Assessment report on grouping of an extension of marketing authorisation and an 
extension of indication variation  
EMA/807473/2022  
Page 48/52 
 
 
 
 
were not primary endpoints, these data could be considered supportive. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The design (non-comparative, limited sample size) of study GS-US-380-1474 and the lack of efficacy 
data on ART-naïve paediatric subjects or patients without virological suppression are very limiting for 
the interpretation of the efficacy and virology results. Notably, paediatric subjects included in this 
study are well controlled under their current ARV, without advanced disease. Therefore, these efficacy 
data may only be relevant for such population, not for ARV-naïve subjects with high viral load and 
advanced disease for whom Biktarvy is also indicated. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The analysis of safety data (GS-US-380-1474) has shown that the overall safety profile of Biktarvy in 
the paediatric population seems comparable to the safety of Biktarvy in adults.  
Safety data have been gathered in 50 children ≥ 12 to < 18 years of age weighing ≥ 35 kg, 50 
children ≥ 6 to < 12 years of age weighing ≥ 25 kg and 22 children ≥ 2 years of age weighing ≥ 14 to 
< 25 kg). The most commonly reported AEs were upper respiratory tract infection, cough, diarrhoea, 
vomiting headache, and nasopharyngitis consistent with those expected in the study population. Most 
AE were grade 1 and 2. No death has been reported. No serious AE nor grade 3 / 4 AE have been 
considered as related to BIC/FTC/TAF. Only one subject discontinued study drug twice due to 2 AEs 
both listed in the section ADR of the Biktarvy SmPC. Increases in serum creatinine and decreases in 
eGFR Schwartz were observed, consistent with the known inhibitory effect of BIC on renal creatinine 
transporters (organic cation transporter 2 and multidrug and toxin extrusion 1), which contributes to a 
decrease in tubular secretion of creatinine, resulting in an increase in serum creatinine. Overall, no 
new safety issue has been identified. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The review of safety data provided from the study GS-US-380-1474 has shown that some AEs such as 
vomiting (8%), arthralgia (6%), rash (6%) abdominal pain (5%) and anxiety (5%) considered for 
Biktarvy as “uncommon” might have been more frequently reported in children compared to what was 
reported in adults. Considering the design of the study, open-label, no further conclusions can be 
drawn except that the safety profile of Biktarvy in children ≥ 2 years of age weighing ≥ 14 kg is 
comparable (and not similar) to that observed in adults with Biktarvy.  
Safety data have been gathered in a limited number of children treated for a limited duration notably 
in children age ≥2 years to <6 years (n=22, approximately half children received BIC/FTC/TAF for ≥36 
Weeks). 
In order to further evaluate the totality of the PK, safety, and efficacy data for all age cohorts/weight 
bands, and in particular renal and bone toxicity, more data need to be submitted. In particular, data 
from the ongoing studies -0128, -1474, -1092 and a final integrated CS report of all the paediatric 
clinical studies where TAF was used, is recommended by the CHMP to be provided. A final report for 
study GS-US-292-0106, where most bone data derive from, is also recommended for submission.

3.6.  Effects Table 
Not applicable. 
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
At the time of submission of this application, children who required to be treated with INSTI-based 
therapy would receive DTG or RAL + other ARVs for backbone therapy, which implies taking each ARV 
individually and increases pill burden, associated with risk of adherence’s decrease. A single tablet 
regimen, EVG/COBI/FTC/TAF co-formulated, is also available but indicated in children ≥6 years old and 
weighing ≥25 kg for whom alternative regimens are unsuitable due to toxicities. 
A single-tablet regimen for paediatric subjects is welcomed for paediatric subjects (especially 
adolescent subjects). The acceptability and compliance of Biktarvy will be further enhanced by the 
possibility to split the tablet in halves (although tablets are not scored). 
The PK and efficacy data did not highlight efficacy and virologic issues: in comparison to adult subjects, 
a similar antiviral activity and virologic suppression is expected with the proposed weight-doses of 
Biktarvy. 
Exposures (AUC and Cmax) of emtricitabine and tenofovir are significantly higher (by approximately 
40% to 80%) than those usually observed in adults. Although no significant increased toxicity is be 
expected with emtricitabine, the potential renal safety consequences of long-term tenofovir exposure 
with the proposed doses, and the impact on growth of paediatric subjects, remain uncertain 
particularly for children ≥2 <6 years of age. The latter is an important potential safety concern in case 
of prolonged exposure for all tenofovir-containing products since the level of tenofovir exposure with 
no negative effects on bone is unknown , which is a particular concern for paediatric patients whose 
bone are still growing. MAHMAH. Therefore, the RMP safety specifications of Biktarvy were updated to 
include “Long term safety in children aged between ≥ 2 and < 6 years” as “missing information”. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
For paediatric subjects, the availability of a new STR regimen is beneficial. The proposed doses of the 
combination of bictegravir + emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide in paediatric subjects are expected to 
be as effective as in adults. As regards the safety of bictegravir + emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide 
in children, safety data are limited and uncertainties remain for the long-term safety consequences of 
tenofovir exposure on renal function, fracture risks and growth, particularly in children ≥2 <6 years of 
age. Adequate warnings have been included in the SmPC to minimize these risks. The potential long-
term safety issues are also expected to be clarified by data awaited from further studies.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Biktarvy is positive in children and adolescents ≥2 years of age and 
weighing ≥14 kg.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality and safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the benefit-risk balance of Biktarvy 30 mg/120 mg/15 mg is favourable in the following 
indication: 
•  Biktarvy is indicated for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection in 
adults and paediatric patients at least 2 years of age and weighing at least 14 kg without 
present or past evidence of viral resistance to the integrase inhibitor class, emtricitabine or 
tenofovir. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Biktarvy subject 
to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation

out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result 
of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0038/2021 and the results of these studies are reflected in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
In addition, CHMP recommends the variation(s) to the terms of the marketing authorisation, 
concerning the following change(s):

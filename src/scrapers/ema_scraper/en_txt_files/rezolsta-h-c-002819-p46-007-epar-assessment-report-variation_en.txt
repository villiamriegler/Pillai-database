1.  Introduction 
On 21-March-2023, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Rezolsta in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that "A Study to Assess the Acceptability of the Darunavir/Cobicistat (DRV/COBI) 
Fixed-dose Combination (FDC) Tablet in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 Infected Children 
Aged ≥3 Years and Weighing ≥15 kg to <25 kg" (TMC114FD1HTX1001) is part of a Paediatric 
Investigation Plan EMEA-001280-PIP01-12-M05. The line extension and type II variation application 
consisting of the full relevant data package (i.e., containing several studies) is expected to be 
submitted by 2025.  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The investigational product supplied for this study was formulated as a tablet for oral use containing 
650 mg of DRV ethanolate (JNJ-25875382) equivalent to 600 mg of DRV base and 173 mg of COBI on 
silicon dioxide (JNJ-48763364), equivalent to 90 mg of COBI. Tablets had to be dispersed in water 
prior to use and contained croscarmellose sodium as disintegrant, mannitol and prosolv as fillers, 
sucralose as sweetener, and strawberry flavour. The FDC tablet is henceforth referred to as DRV/COBI 
600/90.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
DRV (commercial name: PREZISTA) is an HIV-1 protease inhibitor and COBI (commercial name: 
Tybost) is a mechanism-based cytochrome P450 3A inhibitor, which is approved to enhance the 
exposure of co-administered drugs metabolized by CYP3A enzymes, such as DRV. The FDC of DRV 800 
mg and COBI 150 mg is indicated, in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products, for the 
treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults and adolescents (aged 12 years and older, weighing at least 40 
kg) in several countries, including the EU/European Economic Area (commercial name: REZOLSTA) and 
the US (commercial name: PREZCOBIX). 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• Study TMC114FD1HTX1001: 'A Study to Assess the Acceptability of the Darunavir/Cobicistat 
(DRV/COBI) Fixed-dose Combination (FDC) Tablet in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)-1 Infected 
Children Aged ≥3 Years and Weighing ≥15 kg to <25 kg'.  
The aim of the study was to assess the acceptability of a 600/90 mg DRV/COBI FDC oral tablet, taken 
after dispersion in water, in HIV-1 infected children aged ≥3 years and weighing ≥15 kg to <25 kg.  
Other studies in the PIP EMEA-001280-PIP01-12-M05 (but not assessed here) include:  
- 
Study GS-US-216-0128 (evaluating the PK, safety, and efficacy of COBI-boosted atazanavir or 
COBI-boosted DRV administered with a background regimen in HIV-1 infected, virologically 
suppressed paediatric participants);

- 
Study TMC114FD1HTX1004 (bioequivalence study in healthy adults conducted to assess the 
bioequivalence of DRV 600 mg in the presence of COBI 90 mg when administered as an FDC 
compared to the coadministration of the separate available formulations (as administered in 
Study GS-US-216-0128).   
2.3.2.  Clinical study TMC114FD1HTX1001 
Description 
This was a Phase 1, open-label, single-dose, multicentre study conducted at sites in the Republic of 
South Africa, Spain, and the USA that evaluated the acceptability of the 600/90 mg DRV/COBI FDC 
oral tablet (dispersed in water) in HIV-1 infected children, aged ≥3 years and weighing ≥15 kg to <25 
kg.  
The study was conducted from 3 August 2022 to 3 September 2022.   
Methods 
Study participants 
The participants enrolled in the study were HIV-1 infected children aged ≥3 years and weighing ≥15 
kg to <25 kg. Participants were required to be adherent on an allowed stable unchanged antiretroviral 
(ARV) medication for at least 3 months prior to screening, HIV-1 RNA <400copies/ml. Dosage changes 
due to growth in the previous 3 months were allowed. Exclusion criteria included any active condition 
that could prevent swallowing of dispersions in water (e.g., active oral candidiasis infection).  
Assessor's comments:  
The study participants are described on a high level. No upper age limit is listed in the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria (only the upper weight limit). Moreover, an in-depth description of the 
recruitment population (i.e., the pool of children who were screened) was lacking. Further 
elaboration on the in- and exclusion criteria would be necessary to appreciate the study's results 
fully. Such detailed information is considered necessary when the final data package is submitted as 
part of the line-extension / type II variation. 
Treatments 
All participants received DRV/COVI 600/90 mg dispersed in water prior to use. Instructions on how to 
disperse the tablet and about rinsing were detailed in the study site investigational product and 
procedures manual.  
Assessors comment:  
A copy of the instructions provided to the caregiver on how to disperse the tablet is relevant to 
determine how uniformly the procedure of dissolving was followed prior to any potential changes to 
the SmPC regarding using a tablet dispersed in water. This will be assessed as part of the upcoming  
line-extension / type II variation. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to assess, as part of the acceptability, the ability to swallow the 600/90 mg 
DRV/COBI FDC tablet dispersed in water.

regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended  
EMA/CHMP/319165/2023  
Page 5/10 
 
 
 
Secondary objectives were: 
1.  To assess, as part of acceptability, ease of swallowing, the palatability, and the ease of 
dispersion of the tablet 600/90 dispersed in water. 
2.  Acceptability of the intake of the DRV/COBI 600/90 mg FDC tablet dispersed in water, if to be 
taken daily. 
3.  Short-term safety and tolerability of the DRV/COBI 600/90 mg FDC tablet dispersed in water. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was ability to take the DRV/COBI 600/90 mg FDC tablet dispersed in water, 
derived from a questionnaire to be completed by the observing site personnel. The questionnaire 
consisted of 2 questions (one close-ended and one open-ended) taken no more than 15 minutes after 
study intervention. 
Secondary endpoints were (respectively, see numbering in section objectives):  
1.  ease of swallowing and palatability using a questionnaire to be completed by the participant 
and a questionnaire to be completed by the caregiver; ease of dispersion assessed using a 
questionnaire to be completed by the caregiver.  
2.  Acceptability, if to be taken daily, using a questionnaire to be completed by the participant and 
a questionnaire to be completed by the caregiver. 
Assessment of adverse events was performed with open-ended and non-leading questioning of the 
participant and/or caregiver, with the last contact moment a telephone call 8-11 days after 
intervention intake. Questionnaires were taken by the participant/caregiver no more than 15 minutes 
after study intervention. A 5-point hedonic scale with facial expressions to depict likeability or difficulty 
level was used to sort experience into 5 categories "dislike very much", "dislike a little", "not sure", 
"like a little", "like a lot." 
Assessor's comment:  
Participants themselves were asked to fill in the questionnaire, and if necessary, the caregivers 
and/or study-site personnel may have assisted in filling in the questionnaire. As this was an open 
label study, this is a potential source of response bias.  
Sample size 
This study had a precision-based (i.e., not power-based) sample size calculation as there was no 
specific null hypothesis. Assuming that at least 10 of 12 participants would ingest the tablet dispersed 
in water "fully", it was concluded with 80% confidence that the lower bound of the 1-sided CI for ability 
to swallow (i.e., the proportion of participants who would be able to fully swallow the tablet dispersed 
in water), was at least 72% (using the method of Wilson). 
Randomisation and blinding  
The study was an open-label, single-dose study. There was no randomisation and blinding.

Statistical Methods 
All analyses were performed as intention to treat analyses. Primary and secondary endpoints were 
analysed descriptively using frequency tabulations and percentages. The proportion of participants able 
to swallow the medication fully versus partially or not at all, based on the questionnaire for the 
observer, was presented with a corresponding 95% Wilson CI. 
Assessor's comment 
As this is a single-arm, open-label study with minimal sample size, its results are only considered 
descriptive, and no formal conclusions can be drawn.  
Results 
Participant flow 
Of the 12 participants screened for the study, all 12 (100%) were enrolled and all 12 (100%) 
completed the study. Screening took place within 21 days prior to study intervention intake, or on the 
day of intake (Day 1). The total study duration was a maximum of 11 days (not including screening), 
with a safety follow-up check occurring between Day 8 and Day 11.  
Recruitment 
Assessors comment:  
It is not clear what the recruitment population was. In the final report expected in 2025 as part of 
the line-extension / type II variation, this should be outlined to assess the study's generalizability to 
the paediatric HIV-1 population.  
Baseline data  
A higher proportion of participants were female (75.0%), and half were Black or African American 
(50.0%). The median age was 5 years (range 4 to 8 years) and the median weight was 22.65 kg 
(range 15.1 to 23.9 kg). Three participants (25.0%) were ≥3 to <5 years of age and 9 participants 
(75.0%) were ≥5 years of age. See table 1.

Table 1: Demographic Data; Intent-to-Treat (Study TMC114FD1HTX1001) 
Number analysed 
The 12 screened participants were analysed in an intention to treat analysis.  
Efficacy results 
According to the results for the swallowability questionnaire for the site observer, most (10/12; 
83.3%) of the participants swallowed the tablet dispersed in water fully (table 2). For the 2 (16.7%) 
participants who swallowed the tablet dispersed in water partially, the following issues were indicated: 
1 (8.3%) participant refused to take the tablet dispersed in water fully and 1 (8.3%) participant 
experienced gagging and bad taste. The participants who did not swallow the tablet fully had listed 
their history of tablet-taking as "very easy" in the screening questionnaire.  
Assessor's comment:  
The trial protocol states that a history of swallowing drinks, food or medication in liquid form, and 
the medical and surgical history would be obtained from the participant or the caregiver. However, it 
is noted that data from the screening questionnaire is not provided for every participant.

Assessor's comment 
No AEs have been reported during this study (follow up until day 8 to 11), which is not surprising 
considering the limited sample size. Based upon the current data no conclusions on the safety of the 
FDC in this population can be drawn. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
It is agreed that a considerable part of the paediatric population is expected to have difficulties 
swallowing a whole or 2 halves of an oral non-disintegrating tablet. It is, therefore, clinically 
advantageous to have multiple dosage forms of the same medication for this population so that 
caregivers can select the method best tolerated by the specific child.  
This study aimed to assess the acceptability of the FDC darunavir/cobicistat 600/90mg tablets in 
paediatric patients. The study is part of a PIP, which included studies on the bioavailability and 
dissolvability of the FDC. A line-extension and type II variation application consisting of the full 
relevant data package is expected to be submitted by 2025. No quality or pharmacokinetic data were 
provided within the current procedure. 
There were no (severe) adverse events reported in this study. However, 2 of the 12 participants 
reported not taking the medication fully. The two participants who reported taking the dissolved tablet 
partially had given their history of taking medication orally as "very easy." Although protease inhibitors 
have a high barrier to resistance, habitual partial ingestion of any component of HIV therapy with 
subtherapeutic exposure levels is a concern that needs to be addressed with the type II variation 
application.   
The MAH considers no update of the SmPC is warranted in relation to the outcomes of this study. The 
Rapporteur can agree with this statement as the current product information does not state that the 
tablet may be taken after being dispersed. Further, no new safety concerns have been identified based 
on the currently provided data of 12 study participants. Information regarding the recruitment 
methods and population, in- and exclusion criteria (i.e., upper age limit), sample size, patient 
instructions regarding the dissolution of the tablet, the influence of the on-site personnel on the 
response of the questionnaire, and possible consequences of partial ingestion of the dissolved FDC on 
disease management should be addressed when the full relevant data package is submitted as part of 
the line-extension / type II variation (expected in 2025). 
3.  Rapporteur's overall conclusion and recommendation 
The data submitted do not influence the benefit-risk balance for Rezolsta. There is no update of the 
product information necessary based in the information contained within this study. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

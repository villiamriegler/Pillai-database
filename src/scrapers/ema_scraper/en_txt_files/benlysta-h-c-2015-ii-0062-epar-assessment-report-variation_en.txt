Extension of indication to include patients aged 5 years and older in the current approved indication for 
Benlysta (belimumab powder for solution for infusion 120 mg/ml and 400 mg/ml) based on the results of 
the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics study in patients aged 5 years to 17 years (BEL114055). As a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC are updated with safety and efficacy 
information. 
Update of sections 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC for Benlysta (belimumab, solution for injection in 
pre-filled pen and pre-filled syringe, 200 mg) to reflect the paediatric data available for the intravenous 
formulation. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly.  
The RMP version 28.0 is submitted to reflect the results of the study and to bring it in line with the GVP 
Module V RMP template version 2.0. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make some editorial 
changes in the product information and bring it in line with the latest QRD template version 10.0. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2016, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0183/2006 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0183/2016 was completed. 
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP EMEA-C-000520-PIP01-08-M05. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
Scientific advice 
The MAH did not seek Scientific Advice at the CHMP.

Belimumab is a human IgG1λ monoclonal antibody specific for soluble human lymphocyte stimulator 
protein licensed for treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in adult patients. Belimumab does 
not bind B cells directly, but by binding BLyS, belimumab inhibits the survival of B cells, including 
Assessment report

Page 7/88 
 
 
 
 
autoreactive B cells, and reduces the differentiation of B cells into immunoglobulin-producing plasma 
cells.  
Belimumab was approved in EU in 2011 for IV use, and in 2017 for SC use. Belimumab intravenous is 
currently approved in the US, all European Economic Area countries, Japan as well as over 40 further 
countries. Belimumab subcutaneous injection is currently approved in the US, all European Economic 
Area countries, Japan and Canada. Benlysta is currently not approved for Paediatric use. The MAH 
proposed to extend the indication extension to include Paediatric patients based on a Benlysta IV study 
(BEL114055) in Paediatric patients: 
“Belimumab is indicated as add-on therapy in patients aged 5 years and older with active, 
autoantibody-positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with a high degree of disease activity (e.g., 
positive anti-dsDNA and low complement) despite standard therapy.” 
The basis for the application is a phase 2 study, agreed in the PIP at the approval of Benlysta. The study 
was not powered for any formal comparisons between Benlysta and placebo, and the efficacy and safety 
needs to be extrapolated to children using PK data and a numerical comparison of the clinical results 
between the Paediatric and adult studies. 
The results of the study BEL114055 Part A were submitted on 17th July 2018 in accordance with Article 
46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. The data were assessed as part of procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002015/P46/030 which concluded that “The results from BEL144055 will be thoroughly 
assessed when the MAH submits a planned variation for an indication in paediatric patients.” 
The proposed IV dose in Paediatric patients 5 to 17 years of age is the same as that approved in adults: 
10 mg/kg belimumab administered as an IV infusion at 2-week intervals for the first 3 doses and at 
4-week intervals thereafter.  
SLE 
SLE predominantly affects female patients between the ages of 15 and 40, and in approximately 10-20% 
of SLE patients, disease onset occurs prior to 20 years of age [Aggarwal, 2015; Kamphuis, 2010; 
Klein-Gitelman, 2002; Malattia, 2013]. Regardless of age of onset or time of diagnosis, SLE patients share 
many immunogenetic and serologic similarities [Aggarwal, 2015; Barron, 1993; Livingston, 2012; Mina, 
2013]. It has been reported that there are some differences in clinical features in childhood-onset SLE 
[Aggarwal, 2015; Brunner 2008; Costallat, 1994; Mina, 2013; Tucker, 1995]. 
Prepubertal onset of SLE is uncommon, and more often associated to rare monogenic variants, for 
example mutations in the complement system. Paediatric SLE patients tend to have more active disease 
both at the time of diagnosis and over time [Kamphuis, 2010; Livingston, 2012; Mina, 2013]. In a study 
by Brunner et al, the mean Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score in 
Paediatric SLE patients at diagnosis was 1.7 times the score in adult SLE patients (16.8 vs. 9.3, 
respectively) [Brunner, 2008]. SLE in children can be associated with more rapid accrual of damage and 
may have a higher degree of morbidity compared with SLE in adult populations [Brunner, 2008; 
Kamphuis, 2010; Levy, 2012; Malattia, 2013; Tucker, 2008]. In a global study by the PRINTO, damage 
was present in 58.2% of the patients who had disease duration more than 5 years [Gutiérrez-Suárez, 
2006]. The range of organ involvements in Paediatric SLE is generally similar to adult SLE with some 
manifestations more prevalent in children, such as renal lupus, malar rash, seizures, oral ulcers, 
hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia [Aggarwal, 2015; Barron, 1993; Brunner, 2008; Fonseca, 
2018; Mina, 2013; Webb, 2011]. Glomerulonephritis and neurologic involvement represent significant 
disease burden in SLE and occurred at higher frequency in Paediatric SLE [Amaral, 2014; Ambrose, 2016; 
Barron, 1993; Fish, 1977; Fonseca, 2018; King, 1977; Tarr, 2015; Tucker, 2008]. Growth failure and 
delayed puberty are complications of SLE specific to children that may have a serious psychological 
Assessment report  
EMA/547408/2019  
Page 8/88 
 
 
 
impact. The frequency of both events increased significantly with the increase in disease duration 
[Gutiérrez-Suárez, 2006]. 
Relative risk of mortality is higher in Paediatric SLE populations than adult SLE populations [Ambrose, 
2016; Hersh, 2010; Tucker, 2008]. In a case-control analysis of Paediatric SLE (≤18 years old at 
diagnosis) and adult SLE (19-49 years old at diagnosis) patients, mortality after a mean 4.4 years of 
follow-up was 19.4% in Paediatric SLE patients compared to 10.4% in adult SLE patients [Tucker, 2008]. 
Major causes of death in paediatric SLE and adult SLE include renal disease, severe disease flares, and 
infections [Bernatsky, 2006; Cervera, 2006; Glidden, 1983; González, 2005]. 
SLE incidence and prevalence increase with age during childhood, and diagnosis is uncommon in children 
aged ≤9 years [Hiraki, 2012; Lim, 2009; Nightingale, 2007; Somers, 2007]. In a US study of claims data, 
the incidence of SLE was 0.13, 1.92 and 6.40 per 100,000 per year in children aged 3 to <6, 9 to <12 and 
15 to <18 years of age [Hiraki, 2012]. In a population based study in the United Kingdom, 0 and 1 
incident case were identified in children aged <10, and 10-19 respectively [Hopkinson, 1993]. A 
limitation of these estimates is that they are based on small sample sizes and are therefore subject to 
some uncertainty.  
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Being natural proteins, therapeutic antibodies such as benlysta, are not excreted unchanged and do not 
give rise to metabolites with potential biological activity. In view of this, guidance on the environmental 
risk assessment of medicinal products for human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) especially exempt 
amino acids, peptides and proteins from the need for a complete environmental assessment and 
therefore, no assessment of the ERA for Benlysta is needed. 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical aspects are considered acceptable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Belimumab pharmacokinetics (PK) is consistent with other monoclonal antibodies targeting soluble 
ligands. The PK is linear, dose-proportional and time-independent after both IV and SC administration. 
Belimumab clinical pharmacology has been reviewed as part of the adult SLE marketing applications for 
belimumab administered IV and SC. 
Methods 
Plasma concentrations of belimumab in were collected in 53 Paediatric SLE subjects (study BEL114055 
Part A) and analysed with a population PK analysis. Subjects were enrolled into one of three cohorts: 
Cohorts 1 and 3 for ages between 12 and 17 years; Cohort 2 for ages between 5 and 11 years. Subjects 
received a weight-normalized belimumab dose of 10 mg/kg, administered on Days 0, 14 and 28, and 
every 28 days thereafter for 52 weeks. Pharmacokinetic samples were taken on the day of dosing (Days 
0, 14, 28, 56, 168 and 364). For Cohorts 1 and 2, additional PK samples were taken following the first 2 
doses for a more accurate assessment of the PK. Observed belimumab profiles are visualised in Figure 1, 
Figure 2, and Figure 3. Of the 53 subjects included in the analysis data set, 49 subjects were female and 
no subjects had proteinuria greater than 2 mg/mg or tested positive for immunogenicity. The study 
population is further described in Table 2.

Overall Modelling and Analysis Strategy 
The population PK model previously developed for an adult SLE population (Report HGS1006-POPPK), 
two compartmental with zero-order infusion and first-order elimination, was taken as the starting model 
used to characterize the PK of the Paediatric population. In the first instance, the adult model without 
further modification was used to evaluate the Paediatric PK, with the population parameters fixed at their 
adult derived estimates (MAXEVAL=0 argument in NONMEM). The implementation of the covariate 
effects in the adult model were then updated to be consistent with the Paediatric covariate distributions, 
and the population parameters re-estimated for the Paediatric population (Step 1). The full covariate 
model approach [Gastonguay, 2011] was used to quantify the importance of each covariate effect, and 
the covariates which had little impact on PK and did not satisfy the selection criterion were removed from 
the model (Step 2). Additional clinically relevant covariates on the systemic clearance of parent drug (CL) 
parameter of this reduced model were then tested for significance (Step 3). 
Data handling 
Pre-first dose records were excluded from the analysis (one detectable sample of 0.648 µg/mL). Samples 
below limit of quantification were excluded (one sample). Nine post-first dose samples, which were not 
analyzed (NA) were also excluded. 
Model Development and Evaluation 
All data manipulation, model development and analysis were performed with NONMEM version 7.3, PsN 
version 4.6.0 and R version 3.2.5. The first-order conditional estimation method with interaction (FOCE-I) 
in NONMEM v7.3 was used to estimate the parameters of the population PK model, and the likelihood ratio 
test was used to determine whether the drop in objective function was sufficiently large to justify the 
addition of model parameters. For the addition of a single degree of freedom, such as a single covariate 
parameter, the likelihood ratio test requires a drop of at least 3.84 objective function points for this extra 
parameter to be considered significant at the 5% level of uncertainty. 
Basic goodness-of-fit plots and visual predictive checks were used for model evaluation. 
Covariate analysis 
The importance of each covariate on determining the PK was quantified based on a variation of the full 
covariate model method of Gastonguay [Gastonguay, 2011], with covariate inclusion criteria based on 
pharmacokinetic relevance and statistical significance as outlined below. The ratio of the model 
parameter at the 10th and 90th percentiles of the covariate, relative to the model parameter at the median 
covariate value (denoted R10 and R90, respectively) was chosen as a quantifiable measure of the 
pharmacokinetic relevance of the covariate effect accounting for the width of the distribution of the 
underlying covariate values. 
•  A covariate was considered pharmacokinetically relevant if either ratio R10 or R90 was less than 0.8 or 
greater than 1.25 - the same thresholds used for bioequivalence studies. 
• 
o 
If both R10 or R90 were within the 0.8 to 1.25 domain, the 95% confidence interval (CI) about each 
estimate was calculated from the uncertainty in the covariate parameter. If the 95% CIs about each ratio 
remained inside the 0.8 to 1.25 domain, the covariate was considered irrelevant from a pharmacokinetic 
perspective and not retained. 
If the 95% CI of the covariate parameter crossed zero, the covariate could not be classified as being 
positively or negatively correlated with the model parameter with at least 95% certainty. In this case the 
covariate was considered irrelevant from a pharmacokinetic perspective and not retained. 
Assessment report  
EMA/547408/2019  
Page 13/88 
 
 
 
o 
If the 95% CI of the covariate parameter was wholly positive or negative then covariate was classified as 
potentially relevant from a pharmacokinetic perspective and retained. 
The following covariates were tested in the Paediatric study population: proteinuria, body weight, BMI, 
fat-free mass, age, baseline BLyS, baseline C-reactive protein, baseline anti-double stranded DNA 
antibody, baseline complement C3, baseline complement C4, naïve B cells, baseline SELENA-SLEDAI 
score, baseline total bilirubin, baseline alanine aminotransferase, baseline aspartate aminotransferase, 
race, ethnicity, baseline co-medications (immunosuppressant, azathioprine, methotrexate, 
mycophenolate, anti-malarial, NSAID, aspirin). 
Results 
The Paediatric population PK model development was guided by the model structure and covariate effects 
identified in the adult IV population PK analysis [Struemper 2013]. The adult PK model was two 
compartmental with first-order elimination, and between-subject variability on CL, V1, and V2 
parameters. Residual variability was characterized using a combined proportional and additive model. In 
the first instance the adult population PK model was used to characterize the Paediatric PK, without 
modification or re-estimation of the model parameters, and the fit to the individual observations was 
reasonable. Subsequently, the model parameters were re-estimated. The categorical proteinuria 
covariate included in the adult model was replaced with the continuous measure of proteinuria at baseline 
(BPROT), and body size was accounted for with allometric scaling on fat-free mass (BFFM) on all model 
parameters. 
The final model was a linear two compartment model with first-order elimination, with typical estimates 
of clearance (158 mL/day), steady-state volume of distribution (3549 mL or approximately 3.5 L) (Table 
3), and distribution and terminal half-lives of 0.8 and 16.3 days respectively. Shrinkage on the 
between-subject random variables was reasonable at 9.63% (CL), 11.72% (V1) and 20.25% (V2). The 
individual (IPRED) and population (PRED) model predictions matched the observed data, with the 
conditional weighted residuals uniform and unbiased with respect to time and IPRED (Figure 4). A visual 
predictive check of the serum concentration versus nominal time, based on 1000 simulations of the 
paediatric dataset, confirms that the between-subject variability predicted by the model is consistent with 
the spread observed in data (Figure 5). Bootstrap estimates were consistent with the final model 
estimates (Table 3).

Effects of body size on the population PK parameters were best characterized in terms of fat-free mass; 
age did not have a statistically significant effect on clearance after accounting for body size effects. 
Additional statistically significant covariate effects retained in the final model were baseline white blood 
cell count on the central volume of distribution (V1) and baseline immunoglobulin G (IgG), proteinuria, 
and estimated glomerular filtration rate on central clearance. At the 10th and 90th percentiles of the

corresponding covariate distribution, none of the point estimates for these additional covariate effects 
exceeded an effect range of 0.8 to 1.25 (Figure 6), i.e., even towards the extremes of the covariate 
values, the effects on the affected PK parameters were relatively minor. Other covariate effects included 
in the adult IV population PK model [Struemper, 2013] did not satisfy the inclusion criteria and were 
omitted from the final paediatric model.

Additional covariates of clinical interest applied to central clearance in the final model such as baseline 
liver function tests (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], total bilirubin), 
baseline parameters related to disease activity (SELENA-SLEDAI score, B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) 
concentration, C-reactive protein [CRP] concentration), comedications and race categories (Asian, Black) 
were not statistically significant. Hispanic ethnicity was found to be a statistically significant covariate of 
clearance. However, the effect was small with negligible impact on the model’s fit to the data and was not 
added to the final model. 
All pre-dose PK samples were excluded from the analysis; however, one sample was above limit of 
quantification. Clarification was sought during the review on the reason for a pre-dose concentration of 
belimumab, and how the post-dose samples from this patient were handled. The MAH provided a 
description of the data handling for the individual with a positive pre-dose sample, where the post-dose 
PK samples have been included in the analysis. The CHMP agreed that the individual time profile for this 
subject demonstrates a good fit with no indications of an erroneous dose. The use of the post-dose PK 
samples was therefore endorsed by the CHMP.

Pharmacokinetics in the paediatric patient population 
Individual PK and steady-state exposure parameters provided by the final population PK model are 
summarized by age group and compared with adult parameters in Table 4. The adult parameters were 
derived from the 563 subjects who received 10 mg/kg belimumab in the SLE Phase 3 studies [Report 
HGS1006-POPPK]. Steady-state exposure parameters Cmax, Cmin, Cavg, and AUC are similar between 
the age groups with a trend towards slightly higher exposure in the older compared to the younger age 
group. Parameters for both Paediatric age groups and the overall Paediatric population are consistent with 
the adult exposure parameters with largely overlapping confidence intervals. PK parameters CL and Vss 
are slightly lower for the younger compared to the older age group and the same parameters for both 
Paediatric age groups are lower than parameters for adults as expected from the allometric effect of body 
size on clearance and volume of distribution.

Table 5 summarise the PK and exposure parameters by body weight. Values between categories are 
similar with largely overlapping 95% CIs and a weak trend towards increased values for increased body 
weight.  
Table 5 Belimumab Exposure and PK Parameters in IV Belimumab Phase 2 Paediatric Study 
(BEL114055, Part A) by Body Weight Quartile 
Steady-state PK profiles for all belimumab-treated paediatric subjects in study BEL114055 were 
simulated based on their individual PK parameters, summarized by age group and compared with the 
prediction intervals for the individual adult PK profiles (563 subjects who received 10 mg/kg belimumab 
in the SLE Phase 3 studies) in Figure 7. Almost all paediatric profiles are completely contained in the adult 
95% prediction interval; the median paediatric profiles are consistent with the median adult profiles. 
In summary, the PK results indicated that body-weight proportional dosing resulted in similar exposures 
across the body size and age range in the studied paediatric population, and between paediatric and adult 
subjects with SLE.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The MAH states that pharmacodynamic responses to belimumab in Paediatric patients were consistent 
with the proposed mechanism of action of neutralizing BLyS, a B cell survival factor that inhibits B cell 
apoptosis and stimulates the differentiation of B cells into immunoglobulin producing plasma cells.  
Paediatric B cell and immunoglobulin responses are compared in Table 6 with corresponding responses 
from the belimumab IV pivotal trial C1056. Naïve B cells, which among the tested B cell subsets are most 
sensitive to BLyS neutralization, also responded very similar between adult and Paediatric subjects. 
Memory B cells had a lesser increase for Paediatric as compared to adult patients at Week 52, contributing 
to the slightly higher reduction in overall B cells observed in the Paediatric compared to the adult 
population.  
Also for the rare B cells subsets with small serum cell counts (activated, plasmacytoid and SLE subset B 
cells; plasma and short-lived plasma cells), responses were consistent between the Paediatric and adult 
10 mg/kg groups, except for the smaller reduction in plasmacytoid B cells for Paediatric patients. Larger 
differences were observed when comparing Paediatric and adult placebo groups, with increases observed 
for the Paediatric placebo group compared to relatively minor changes in the adult placebo group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/547408/2019  
Page 20/88 
 
 
 
 
Comparisons with adult results need to be interpreted with caution due to the large between-subject 
variability of B cell measurements, especially for these less frequent B cell and plasma cell subsets, and 
the small Paediatric subject numbers.  
Median percent changes from baseline at Week 52 for serum immunoglobulins were similar between 
Paediatric and adult populations (Table 6). Median percent changes from baseline at Week 52 for 
anti-dsDNA autoantibodies and complement C3 and C4 in response to 10 mg/kg belimumab were similar 
between Paediatric and adult SLE patients (data not shown here).  
The MAH concludes that B cell and plasma cell, as well as immunoglobulin and SLE biomarker responses 
were consistent between Paediatric and adults SLE patients receiving 10 mg/kg IV belimumab.  
Table 6 Median Percent Change from Baseline in Biomarkers at Week 52 in IV Belimumab Phase 2 
Paediatric and Pivotal Phase 3 Adult Studies 
Some important differences were noted by the CHMP in the pharmacodynamics response. In 
placebo-treated subjects, the median percent change from baseline for some biomarkers differs widely 
between children (BEL114055) and adults (C1056), for example activated and plasmacytoid B cells. The 
MAH was asked to discuss these findings, and whether these differences are of importance for the 
extrapolation to children. The MAH clarified that these rare B cell subsets had a large variability in the 
Benlysta clinical development plan, and that the observed differences could be due to the small number 
of cases included in the paediatric study. This CHMP considered the response acceptable.

2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
A post-hoc, exploratory exposure-response analysis was conducted to assess any impact of 
between-subject exposure variability on clinical response at Week 52 in the 10 mg/kg group of the 
Paediatric study BEL114055. The analysis demonstrated relatively flat exposure-response characteristics 
for clinical responses within the tested 10 mg/kg dose level based on exposures quantified by 
steady-state Cavg, Cmax, and Cmin. SLE Responder Index responders had a similar median exposure 
than non-responders; both groups showed large overlap between exposures (Figure 8). Similarly, 
subjects who had a serious adverse event (SAE) any time during Part A had a similar median exposure 
than subjects who had no SAE; both groups showed large overlap between exposures (Figure 9). Also 
naïve B cells (Figure 10), a key pharmacodynamic response variable, or biomarkers for clinical response 
such anti-dsDNA antibodies (Figure 11) had relatively flat exposure response curves.

Figure 11 Anti-dsDNA Antibody Response at Week 52 versus Belimumab Cavg in IV 
Belimumab Phase 2 Paediatric Study (BEL114055, Part A) 
These exposure-response results for the BEL114055 Paediatric study population are consistent with prior 
clinical experiences in adult SLE patients. In the two pivotal belimumab IV Phase 3 trials C1056 and 
C1057 there was no apparent safety dose-response, only a relatively flat efficacy dose-response, and for 
most biomarkers little or no difference between the responses to the 1 or 10 mg/kg doses [Furie, 2011; 
Navarra, 2011; Stohl, 2012]. Similarly, in the belimumab SC Phase 3 trial BEL112341 (weekly 200 mg 
belimumab) there was no apparent efficacy, safety or biomarker exposure-response [Struemper, 2018]. 
The combination of these exposure or dose-response results indicates that at IV 10 mg/kg every four 
weeks or at SC 200 mg every week dose levels, the functional relationship between BLyS neutralization 
and belimumab exposure is in a saturated phase at near maximal BLyS neutralization.  
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Belimumab concentrations were collected in 53 Paediatric SLE subjects (study BEL114055, part A) and 
analysed with a population PK analysis. PK samples were measured on the day of dosing (Days 0, 14, 28, 
56, 168, and 364) and a minimum of 6 samples per individual were collected. The belimumab population 
Assessment report  
EMA/547408/2019  
Page 23/88 
 
 
 
 
 
PK model previously developed for an adult SLE population [Report HGS1006-POPPK], two 
compartmental with zero-order infusion and first-order elimination, was taken as the starting model used 
to characterize the PK of the Paediatric population. Structural model parameters and covariate effects 
were estimated using paediatric data only. 
A population PK analysis was performed on the paediatric PK data with the aim to compare paediatric and 
adult belimumab exposure to support the extrapolation of efficacy and safety of adult Benlysta results. In 
general, the analysis is well performed. In the adult model, body weight was a covariate on both the CL 
and V1, scaling positively with both parameters. Body mass index was also an additional covariate on V1 
with a negative correlation; that is, a larger BMI was associated with a smaller central volume. The 
fat-free mass may be a better predictor of clearance and volume, and this BMI correction to volume may 
account for subjects who have a typical body weight but a large BMI, and therefore a smaller fat-free 
mass. This modification seems reasonable and is acceptable. 
The covariate analysis was questioned by the CHMP as it was not fully understood why a covariate 
analysis have been performed in the paediatric population if the expectation is that the pharmacology is 
the same in adults and children. Results of the predictions from the reference adult model were not 
submitted and hence it was not possible to evaluate whether it would have been sufficient to use the 
paediatric predictions as such. In the response, the MAH provided documentation for the initial runs with 
the adult model and it was clear that adult model did not provide accurate paediatric predictions, and 
hence re-estimation on the paediatric data was considered acceptable by the CHMP. The following 
covariate effects, included in the adult population PK model, were not relevant from a PK perspective for 
paediatrics: albumin on CL; administration of an ACE-inhibitor or steroid on CL; haemoglobin levels as a 
covariate on V1. These four covariate effects were removed from the paediatric PK model. As the 
paediatric sample size is somewhat small to be able to draw firm conclusions on the covariate analysis 
[Ribbing and Jonsson, 2004], the MAH was asked during the evaluation to provide model predictions with 
the excluded covariates in the model. From a pharmacological reasoning, it was not understood why for 
example albumin and haemoglobin are not predictors of PK in the paediatric population when that is the 
case in the adult population. In response, the MAH provided reasoning that the removed covariates were 
not statistically significant predictions for the paediatric data. Furthermore the albumin and haemoglobin 
levels measured in the paediatric data would not lead to clinically meaningful changes in PK. The CHMP 
agreed that from a purely predictive purpose the PK model is adequate. However, in future analyses, the 
MAH is recommended to keep pharmacologically plausible covariates in the paediatric model.  
The final model seems to describe the paediatric data reasonably well; however, the MAH was asked to 
provide a visual predictive check with Concentration versus Time after dose for clarity. The exposure 
versus body weight graphs provided by the MAH indicated that the median belimumab concentration in 
the paediatric population is in general somewhat higher than in the adult population although the 
exposure range in both indications are largely overlapping. However, since no apparent exposure-safety 
relationship has been detected for serious adverse events or serious infections the exposure range in the 
paediatric population is acceptable and the proposed dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg to all SLE patients was 
endorsed by the CHMP. 
In study BEL114055, the pharmacodynamic response was consistent with the adult data. 
An exploratory exposure-response analysis has been provided where no apparent exposure-response 
relationship could be detected. These results are similar to the findings in the adult SLE population and 
could potentially be interpreted as that maximum response has been reached. However, a limitation of 
the analysis is based on one dose level which means that the exposure relation cannot be distinguished 
from other factors influencing the response and should as such be interpreted with caution. Due to the 
limited dose-ranging information in the Paediatric study, additional exposure-response analyses on this 
study data are not foreseen to be informative. 
Assessment report  
EMA/547408/2019  
Page 24/88 
 
 
 
The steady-state exposure parameters Cmax, Cmin, Cavg, and AUC were similar between the age and 
weight groups with a trend towards slightly higher exposure in the older compared to the younger age 
group. Exposure parameters for both Paediatric age groups and the overall Paediatric population were 
consistent with the adult exposure parameters with largely overlapping confidence intervals. Geometric 
mean Cmax,ss=305/317/311 [µg/mL] and AUC=2569/3126/2811 [day µg/mL] in 5-11 years old, 12-17 
years old, and adults, respectively. Cmin were 2569 [day µg/mL] in the 5- to 11-year-old-group, and 
3126 [day µg/mL] in the 12- to 17-year-old-group. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic parameters are based on individual parameter estimates from a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis of 53 patients from a study in paediatric patients. Following intravenous 
administration of 10 mg/kg on Days 0, 14 and 28, and at 4 week intervals thereafter belimumab 
exposures were similar between paediatric and adult SLE subjects. Steady-state geometric mean Cmax, 
Cmin, and AUC values were 305 µg/mL, 42 µg/mL, and 2569 day.µg/mL in the 5- to 11-year-old-group, 
and 317 µg/mL, 52 µg/mL, and 3126 day.µg/mL in the 12- to 17-year-old-group (n=43). 
The belimumab population PK model for the Paediatric population adequately described the data. The 
median exposure in paediatrics is slightly higher compared to adults. However no apparent 
exposure-safety relationship has been detected for serious adverse events or serious infections, either in 
the paediatric or adult population; therefore the exposure range in the paediatric population is acceptable 
and the proposed dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg to all SLE patients was endorsed by the CHMP.

2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No dose-response studies have been performed in children which was considered acceptable to the CHMP. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
BEL114055: Double-Blind Trial to Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, and 
Pharmacokinetics of Belimumab, a Human Monoclonal Anti- BLyS Antibody, 
Plus Standard Therapy in Paediatric Patients with Systemic Lupus 
Erythematosus (SLE)  
Methods 
BEL114055 was a multi-centre study to evaluate the safety, efficacy and PK of belimumab plus 
background standard therapy in at least 70 paediatric subjects 5 years to 17 years of age with active SLE. 
The study consists of three separate phases: 
•  Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind 52-week treatment phase (Part A)  
• 
• 
Long term belimumab open label safety follow up for any subject who completes Part A (Part B) 
Long term safety follow-up phase for subjects who withdraw from Part A or Part B at any time (Part C)  
A schematic of the study is provided in Figure 12.

Figure 12. BEL114055 Study Schematic 
Study participants 
Eligible subjects were 5 to 17 years of age and had clinically active SLE disease, defined as a SELENA 
SLEDAI disease activity score of ≥6 at screening. Subjects had to have 4 or more of the 11 American 
College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for the classification of SLE either at screening or in the past. 
Subjects also had to have an unequivocally positive test result for anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) titer ≥1:80 
and/or anti-dsDNA ≥30 IU/mL serum antibody either from 2 independent time points within the study 
screening period or 1 positive historical test result and 1 positive test result during the screening period. 
Subjects were to be on a stable SLE treatment regimen at a fixed dose for at least 30 days prior to Day 
0 inclusive of any of the following (alone or in combination): corticosteroids (prednisone or prednisone 
equivalent up to 0.5 mg/kg/day), antimalarials, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or any 
other immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapy including methotrexate, azathioprine, 
leflunomide, mycophenolate (including mycophenolate mofetil [MMF], mycophenolate mofetil 
hydrochloride, and mycophenolate sodium), calcineurin inhibitors (e.g., tacrolimus, cyclosporine), 
sirolimus, oral cyclophosphamide, 6-mercaptopurine, or thalidomide.  
Key exclusion criteria included active central nervous system (CNS) lupus requiring therapeutic 
intervention within 60 days prior to Day 0; requiring renal replacement therapy (e.g., hemodialysis, 
peritoneal dialysis) within 90 days of Day 0 or currently on renal replacement therapy; an estimated 
glomerular filtration rate as calculated by Schwartz Formula of less than 30 mL/min; or acute severe 
nephritis defined as a significant worsening of renal disease (e.g., the presence of urinary sediments and 
other lab abnormalities) that, in the opinion of the study investigator, could have led to the subject 
requiring induction therapy with IV cyclophosphamide, MMF or high dose corticosteroids during the first 
6 months of the trial. Other exclusion criteria included receipt of belimumab or any B cell targeted therapy 
at any time and receipt of specific treatments/therapy (e.g., abatacept, any biologic investigational 
agent, IV cyclophosphamide, anti-tumor necrosis factor [TNF], interleukin-1 receptor antagonist

[anakinra], IV immunoglobulin [IVIG], 3 or more courses of systemic corticosteroids, plasmapheresis, 
live vaccine) within protocol-defined timeframes prior to Day 0.  
There are no important differences between the eligibility criteria in BEL114055 and the phase III studies 
in adults.  
At the time of BEL114055 study initiation in late 2012, a SELENA SLEDAI score ≥8 at screening was 
required. This was intended to enrich the enrolled population as subjects with higher disease activity in 
the 2 pivotal adult IV studies demonstrated a greater treatment effect for belimumab vs. placebo as 
measured by the SRI (see below). However, due to continued enrolment difficulties, eligibility criteria 
were subsequently relaxed following protocol Amendment 04 by reducing the SELENA SLEDAI score 
required at screening to ≥6. 
Treatments 
Subjects in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 were randomized in a 5:1 ratio and in Cohort 3, in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 
2 treatment groups:  
• 
belimumab 10 mg/kg on Days 0, 14, 28 and then every 28 days through Week 48 of the blinded 
period for a total of 14 doses. 
or  
• 
placebo 
In Cohort 3, randomization was stratified by age group (5-11 or 12-17 years at screening) and screening 
SELENA SLEDAI scores (6-12 vs. ≥13). (Note: the planned stratification included age group but no 
children in the younger age group were randomized to Cohort 3).  
Concomitant treatment with azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, methotrexate and oral 
cyclophosphamide in restricted doses was allowed.  
The total dose of systemic steroids could be increased as clinically required during the first 6 months of 
the trial, but must have returned to within 25% or 5 mg over the baseline dose, whichever was higher, by 
Week 24.  
After Week 24, an increase > 25% or > 5 mg over the baseline dose, whichever is higher, for SLE activity 
deemed the subject a treatment failure. 
Within 8 weeks before Week 52, no new increase over the baseline or Week 44 visit dose, whichever is 
higher, was allowed. 
Objectives 
The objectives of the study were to:  
• 
•

• 
Evaluate the safety and tolerability of belimumab in the Paediatric SLE population.  
Evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of belimumab in the Paediatric SLE population.  
Evaluate the efficacy of belimumab in the Paediatric SLE population.  
Evaluate the effects of belimumab on the quality of life in the Paediatric SLE population. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the SLE Response Index (SRI) response rate at Week 52.

BILAG A organ domain score or 2 new BILAG B organ domain scores compared with baseline at the time 
of assessment (i.e., at Week 52) . 
The major secondary efficacy endpoints were:

in juvenile SLE using two different PRINTO/ACR Juvenile SLE Response Evaluation definitions of 
improvement  
a.  At least 50% improvement in any 2 of 5 endpoints below and no more than 1 of the remaining worsening 
by more than 30%

efficacy endpoint at Weeks 44, 48 and 52  
3.  Proportion of subjects with a sustained ParentGA response defined as having >0.7 improvement at Weeks 
44, 48, and 52 compared to baseline  
Among other secondary endpoints were time to first severe flare, time to first flare and cumulative 
prednisone dose at Week 52.  
Safety outcomes were: 
•  Adverse Event (including infusion-related and hypersensitivity reactions, infections and malignancies) 
reported throughout the 52-week treatment period and 8 week follow-up.  
•  Haematological and clinical chemistry parameters (including urinalysis) throughout the 52-week 
treatment period and 8 week follow-up.  
•  Vital signs (i.e., pulse rate and systolic and diastolic blood pressure) throughout the 52-week treatment 
period and 8 week follow-up  
• 
Physical examination  
•  Suicidality assessment (for subjects ≥12 years of age)  
• 
Immunogenicity during the 52-week treatment period and 8 week follow-up. A 6 month follow-up 
assessment will be included for all subjects that have a positive anti-belimumab antibody response at the 
8 week follow-up assessment.  
•  Additional safety tests (such as vital signs, physical examinations and laboratory safety tests) or change 
in timing or addition of assessments may be performed during the course of the study based on newly

available data to ensure appropriate safety monitoring. IRB/IEC will be informed of any safety issues that 
require alteration of the safety monitoring scheme.  
Sample size 
As juvenile SLE is an uncommon disease, at the time of protocol development, it was assumed that 
recruitment of subjects would be challenging. The original decision to enrol 100 subjects was based on 
feasibility estimations. The following is a description of what statistical information these 100 subjects 
would have provided. Combining the subject cohorts, a total of 100 subjects would have been 
randomized. In the first two cohorts, at least 24 subjects would have been randomized in a 5:1 ratio 
(belimumab:placebo), and the remaining 76 subjects would have been randomized in a 1:1 allocation 
ratio. Therefore, 58 subjects would have been randomized to belimumab and 42 to placebo. Using the 
methods of PASS 2005 [Hintze, 2006] for the precision of a confidence interval (CI) around a single 
proportion; a sample size of 42 would have produced a 95% CI around the sample proportion ± 0.15191 
when the estimated proportion of subjects attaining the primary efficacy response at Week 52 is 0.39 (for 
placebo), and a sample size of 58 would have produced a 95% CI around the sample proportion ± 
0.12793 when the estimated proportion is 0.51 (for belimumab).  
Sample Size Sensitivity  
The estimated proportions cited above are the Week 52 results for placebo and belimumab 10 mg/kg 
from the combined pivotal Phase 3 studies of IV belimumab in adults with SLE. The estimated proportions 
of subjects attaining the primary efficacy response at Week 52 from the 76-week Phase 3 study in adults 
with SLE were 34% and 43% for placebo and belimumab 10 mg/kg, respectively, and for the 52-week 
study in adults with SLE were 43% and 57%.  
Sample size sensitivity calculations were performed considering these results. In this study, for estimated 
proportions ranging from 0.31 to 0.69, the precision for the 95% CI ranges from approximately 0.12 to 
0.13 when the sample size is 58, and from approximately 0.14 to 0.15 when the sample size is 42.  
Sample Size Re-estimation  
As a consequence of continuing enrolment challenges, despite an increase in the number of participating 
clinical sites worldwide and concentrated outreach efforts, a sample size reduction based on the 
extrapolation of recruitment performance to January 2017 was agreed to with the PDCO.  
A reduction in subjects from 100 to “at least 70”, although affecting the sample size calculations, did not 
alter the fact that this study was designed to descriptively evaluate the efficacy and safety of belimumab 
in Paediatric SLE.  
In the first two cohorts, at least 22 subjects were randomized in a 5:1 ratio (belimumab:placebo), and the 
remaining subjects (at least 48) were randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio. Therefore, approximately 42 
subjects were randomized to belimumab and 28 to placebo. Using the methods of PASS 2005 [Hintze, 
2006] for the precision of a CI around a single proportion; a sample size of 28 produces a 95% CI around 
the sample proportion ±0.18143 when the estimated proportion of subjects attaining the primary efficacy 
response at Week 52 is 0.39 (for placebo), and a sample size of 42 produces a 95% CI around the sample 
proportion±0.15286 when the estimated proportion is 0.51 (for belimumab).  
Sample size sensitivity calculations were performed considering the primary efficacy response at Week 52 
in the pivotal Phase 3 studies of IV belimumab in adults with SLE.  
In this study, for estimated proportions ranging from 0.31 to 0.69, the precision for the 95% CI ranges 
from approximately 0.14 to 0.15 when the sample size is 42 (Belimumab), and from approximately 0.17 
to 0.20 when the sample size is 28 (Placebo).

Given the descriptive nature of the study implying that no formal statistical hypothesis testing was 
planned and also the expected recruitment challenges, the initial target number of 100 subjects is 
acceptable. When recruitment was found to be even more challenging than expected, a decrease in the 
target number of subjects from 100 to 70 was proposed and also agreed with PDCO through a 
modification request to the PIP. The study completion date had by then already been extended by 2 years 
and the revised sample size implied that recruitment could be completed within a reasonable timeframe.  
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomised into Part A of BEL114055 in 3 cohorts, with Cohort 3 being stratified by 
screening SELENA SLEDAI scores (6-12 vs. >13) and by age (5-11 years vs. 12-17 years). Of the 
randomised subjects, at least 14 subjects were to be younger than 13 years of age and at least 50% were 
to have a SELENA SLEDAI ≥8 at screening. 
Enrolment was staggered to allow PK analysis of the first 2 age cohorts (Cohort 1 in Dec 2015 and Cohort 
2 in Jul 2017) to inform the need for adjustment or confirmation of the 10 mg/kg IV belimumab dose. 
Randomisation and stratification in the 3 cohorts was as follows: 
Cohort 1: The first 12 subjects aged 12 to 17 years of age were randomized in a 5:1 ratio to belimumab 
10 mg/kg (n=10) or placebo (n=2) on a background of standard of care for 48 weeks. After all subjects 
in Cohort 1 received at least 8 weeks of treatment, safety review and PK analysis were conducted. 
Administration of study agent in Cohort 1 subjects continued while safety monitoring and PK analysis 
were progressed, but no additional subjects were enrolled until the safety review and PK analysis were 
completed. The 10 mg/kg belimumab dose was confirmed in this age group, and enrollment in Cohort 2 
and the older age group (12 to 17 years) of Cohort 3 was initiated. 
Cohort 2: At least 10 subjects aged 5 to 11 years of age were planned to be randomised in a 5:1 ratio to 
belimumab or placebo for 48 weeks on a background of standard of care. After all subjects in Cohort 2 
received at least 8 weeks of treatment, safety review and PK analysis were conducted. Administration of 
study agent in Cohort 2 subjects continued while safety monitoring and PK analysis progressed, but no 
additional subjects aged 5-11 years were enrolled in the study until the safety review and PK analysis 
were completed. The 10 mg/kg belimumab dose was confirmed for this age group. 
Cohort 3: At least 48 subjects aged 5 to 17 years old were planned to be randomised in a 1:1 ratio to 
belimumab or placebo on a background of standard of care for 52 weeks. The randomisation of Cohort 3 
was stratified by age and SELENA SLEDAI score. 
Blinding (masking) 
The pharmacist or designee involved in the preparation of the IV infusion of belimumab or placebo was 
unblinded to the treatment allocation of each subject at that site. The site pharmacist or designee was 
also the person responsible for receiving, storage, accountability and destruction of unused study agent 
as well as dispensing study agent, but independent of all other study activities. To prevent unblinding, the 
injection membrane on the placebo infusion bag was to be punctured with an injection needle.  
Once diluted, in a saline bag, belimumab was identical in appearance to placebo and was administered by 
a blinded member of the site staff.  
A designated unblinded GSK Monitor was responsible for oversight of the pharmacist’s activities.  
All other study site personnel, the subject and the sponsor’s blinded study team remained blinded to the 
investigational product received and to certain biomarkers and pharmacodynamic laboratory results.  
Assessment report  
EMA/547408/2019  
Page 30/88 
 
 
 
Treatment codes could be unblinded by the investigator or treating physician only in the case of a medical 
emergency or in the event of a serious medical condition, when knowledge of the investigational product 
was essential for the clinical management or welfare of the subject. GSK Global Clinical Safety and 
Pharmacovigilance (GCSP) staff could unblind treatment codes in the event of a serious adverse event 
(SAE).  
Statistical methods 
The study was designed to descriptively evaluate the safety and efficacy of belimumab, and as such no 
formal statistical hypothesis testing was planned and no p-values were to be presented. 
Analysis populations 
Intent-to-Treat (ITT) 
The analysis of the double-blind treatment phase (Part A) was performed on the ITT population. The ITT 
population was defined as all subjects who were randomised and treated with at least one dose of study 
agent in Part A. Summaries using the ITT population grouped subjects according to the treatment that a 
subject was randomised to receive, regardless of the actual treatment received. 
Completers 
The Completers population was defined as all subjects who completed all 52 weeks of Part A. A sensitivity 
analysis was performed on the Completers population. 
As-Treated 
The as-treated population was defined as all subjects who received at least one dose of study treatment 
in Part A. Summaries using the as-treated population grouped subjects according to the actual treatment 
administered to the subject. If a subject received an incorrect treatment, the as-treated analysis was 
performed according to the treatment that the subject received most of the time (>50% of the time). No 
sensitivity analysis was done for this population as no subjects received an incorrect dose >50% of the 
time. 
Per-Protocol (PP) 
Prior to breaking the blind, data for all subjects in the ITT Population were reviewed to identify protocol 
violations which could affect the primary endpoint. Subjects with violations with the potential to impact 
the efficacy analyses were excluded from the PP Population. A sensitivity analysis was not performed for 
this population as less than 15% of subjects had a violation that could affect the primary endpoint. 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) 
The PK population comprised all subjects included in the As-Treated population for whom at least one post 
belimumab treatment PK sample was obtained and analysed. Summaries using this population were 
based on the actual treatment received if this differed from that to which the subject was randomised. 
Primary efficacy endpoint analysis 
Subjects with baseline SELENA SLEDAI score less than 4 or missing SRI components at baseline were 
excluded from the analysis. 
The number and percentage of subjects achieving an SRI response at Week 52 were presented for 
belimumab and placebo. A logistic regression model was used to estimate the odds of an SRI response for 
belimumab vs. placebo. The independent variables in the model included treatment group, baseline age 
group (5-11 years vs. 12-17 years), and baseline SELENA SLEDAI score (≤12 vs. ≥13). 
Assessment report  
EMA/547408/2019  
Page 31/88 
 
 
 
The SRI response at Week 52 data were summarized by the number and percentage of subjects achieving 
a response by treatment group, the treatment difference versus placebo, and the odds ratio and 95% CI 
for belimumab versus placebo. Odds ratio estimates and 95% CI are also displayed for each independent 
variable in the model. 
In support of the primary endpoint, the number and percentage of subjects meeting each of the three 
components of the primary endpoint at Week 52 was presented. 
Analysis of Major Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The number and percentage of subjects meeting each of 2 definitions of the PRINTO/ACR Juvenile SLE 
Response Evaluation were analysed using a similar model as described for the primary efficacy endpoint. 
The 5 endpoints considered in the PRINTO/ACR Juvenile SLE Response Evaluation definition: percent 
change in ParentGA, percent change in PGA, percent change in SELENA SLEDAI score, percent change in 
proteinuria, and percent change in PedsQL GC physical functioning domain score were also analysed 
using ANCOVA or a similar model as described for the primary efficacy endpoint, as appropriate. 
In addition, the proportion of subjects with a sustained SRI response (defined as having a response on the 
primary efficacy endpoint at Weeks 44, 48 and 52) and the proportion of subjects with a sustained 
ParentGA response (defined as having >0.7 improvement at Weeks 44, 48, and 52 compared to baseline) 
were analyzed using a similar model as described for the primary efficacy endpoint. 
Drop-out/Treatment Failure = Non-responder (DO/TF=NR) 
The DO/TF=NR principle was used for all DO/TF efficacy endpoints, including the primary efficacy 
endpoint and each of the three components of the primary efficacy endpoint. The basic premise of the 
DO/TF=NR analysis was that a subject who withdraws and does not have a visit within ±28 days of the 
Day 365 (Week 52) visit, i.e., a dropout, and/or uses a prohibited medication or a non-allowed dose of a 
restricted medication resulting in treatment failure designation was considered a non-responder in the 
analysis for Part A. 
Additional efficacy analyses 
Additional efficacy analyses included e.g. time to first severe SFI flare over the 52 weeks of Part A. Time 
to first severe flare and time ti first flare (any), respectively was compared between belimumab and 
placebo using a Cox proportional hazards model, adjusting for baseline age group (5-11 years vs. 12-17 
years) and baseline SELENA SLEDAI score (≤12 vs. ≥13). 
PK and Safety endpoints 
PK and Safety endpoints were summarized using descriptive statistics as appropriate. 
An exploratory, post-hoc exposure-response analysis correlating exposure parameters with Week 52 
response parameters (analysis included calculation of p-values) was added to assess the impact of 
exposure variability on the clinical response. 
Database locks 
There are three database locks planned for this study, corresponding to the primary analysis of Part A, the 
follow-up analysis of Part B, and the follow-up analysis of Part C. The database was locked for the primary 
analysis following completion of the double-blind treatment phase (Part A) of the study.

Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 124 subjects were screened to yield 93 randomised subjects. All 93 randomised subjects 
received at least 1 dose of study agent. The most common reason for failed screening was physician 
decision (n=27). The 93 subjects (40 in the placebo group and 53 in the belimumab 10 mg/kg group) in 
the ITT population were enrolled across 29 sites in 10 countries. Most subjects (81.7%) completed the 
study through Week 52 (Table 7). The percentage of subjects who withdrew from the study prior to Week 
52 was 22.5% in the placebo group and 15.1% in the belimumab group. Adverse event was the most 
common reason for withdrawal.  
Table 7. Subject Completion Status by Week 52 (Part A) (ITT Population) 
The treatment blind was broken by site personnel for 5 subjects. For 4 subjects (3 placebo, 1 belimumab), 
this occurred following their early discontinuation from Part A of the study in order that the investigator 
could best determine their optimal ongoing medical management. For 1 subject (belimumab), the 
unblinding was a protocol deviation, as the investigator became unblinded to the treatment assignment 
after inadvertently viewing a report generated by the IXRS to the unblinded site staff. This subject 
remained in the study and completed Part A.  
Recruitment 
Subjects were randomised in 3 different cohorts. The first 12 subjects (aged 12-17 ys) were randomised 
(5:1) into Cohort 1; 10 subjects to the belimumab arm and 2 subjects to placebo. A total of 13 subjects 
(aged 5-11 ys) were randomised into Cohort 2; 10 subjects to the belimumab arm and 3 subjects to 
placebo. A total of 68 subjects were randomised (1:1) into Cohort 3; 33 subjects to the belimumab arm 
and 35 to the placebo arm. 
Conduct of the study 
The percentage of subjects with important protocol deviations was 43.4% in the belimumab 10 mg/kg 
group and 32.5% in the placebo group (Table 8).  
Assessment report  
EMA/547408/2019  
Page 33/88 
 
 
 
 
Table 8. Subjects with Important Protocol Deviations (Part A) (ITT Population) 
In both treatment groups, the majority of important protocol deviations were in the category of 
assessments and/or procedures (Table 8). This broad category included deviations related to failure to 
comply with required collection of PK samples for subjects in Cohorts 1 and 2, failure to comply with 
required safety and efficacy assessments, failure to comply with requirements for informed consent, 
failure to comply with procedures for investigational product handling (e.g. incorrect storage or 
preparation), and failure to maintain the study blind.  
In the deviation category of not withdrawn after developing withdrawal criteria, post-data base lock, the 
study team identified 6 subjects for whom this deviation should have been but were not recorded (3 
placebo, 3 belimumab) and 1 subject for whom this deviation was incorrectly recorded (placebo). 
Therefore, a total of 8 subjects were not withdrawn after developing withdrawal criteria, 4 in the placebo 
group and 4 in the belimumab group. These subjects who were not promptly withdrawn after receiving 
prohibited doses of concomitant medications all completed Part A.  
No subjects from the placebo group and 1 subject from the belimumab group had an important deviation 
in the category of wrong treatment or incorrect dose. This deviation occurred at a single study visit at 
Week 36 when the subject received the wrong treatment (placebo instead of belimumab). This subject 
had no AEs during the study. At the time of this report, there was one GCP noncompliance issue identified 
related to a delay in emergency unblinding. The issue was reviewed for root cause and addressed by the 
Sponsor to ensure future compliance.  
There were many protocol deviations in the belimumab group (43.4% important deviations). Important 
deviations include, but are not limited to, those related to study inclusion or exclusion criteria, adherence 
to the protocol, conduct of the study, subject management or subject assessment. The CHMP noted that 
this is a broad category with a mix of compliance with sample collection and protection of blind. Since the 
extrapolation is mainly based on PK data, this was not further pursued.

maintains tribal affiliation or community  attachment. 
The majority of subjects were female, and the mean age was 14 years. Patients in the belimumab group 
were more often Hispanic or Latino, but the proportion of African descents were similar in both group. Of 
note, in the belimumab phase 3 trials, the black population seemed to benefit less from belimumab than 
the overall population.

More subjects in the belimumab group were anti-ds-DNA positive and had low complement levels, 
indicating high disease activity, but the differences are small. 
Numbers analysed 
Analysis populations are summarized in Table 12. All 93 randomized subjects were included in the ITT 
population.

Table 12. Number of Subjects in Analysis Populations 
All randomised subjects received at least one dose of study treatment, and is therefore identical to the ITT 
population. As stated in the RAP, the PP population was to be used only for a sensitivity analysis of the 
primary efficacy endpoint if more than 15% of subjects had a violation that could affect the primary 
efficacy endpoint. One subject in each group was excluded from PP analysis because of important protocol 
deviations; hence no analysis based on the PP population was performed. A sensitivity analysis of the 
primary endpoint, SRI response at Week 52, was however performed based on the Completers analysis 
population. Overall, a higher proportion of the subjects in the belimumab arm than in the placebo arm 
completed the study: 45/53 (84.9%) and 31/40 (77.5%) respectively.

a.  One ITT subject did not have a baseline SELENA SLEDAI assessment and, therefore, did not contribute to SRI/component 
analyses. 
b.  For C1056 and C1057, Odds ratio (95% CI) is from logistic regression for the comparison between each belimumab dose 
and placebo with covariates. For individual studies, covariates include baseline SELENA SLEDAI score (≤9 vs. ≥10), 
baseline proteinuria level (<2 g/24 hour vs. ≥2 g/24 hour equivalent) and race  (African descent or indigenous−American 
descent vs. Other). 
For BEL114055, Odds ratio (95% CI) is from a logistic regression model for the comparison between belimumab  and placebo 
with covariates treatment group, baseline age (5-11 vs. 12-17), and baseline SELENA SLEDAI  score (≤12 vs. ≥13). 
Key Supportive and Sensitivity Analyses of the Primary SRI Efficacy  Endpoint 
Included in the pre-specified sensitivity analyses in BEL114055 was SRI6 response at  Week 52 (Table 
15). The SRI6 was defined identically to the SRI except the SRI6 used a higher threshold of improvement 
for SELENA SLEDAI, a ≥6 point reduction, in order for a subject to be declared a responder. Within 
BEL114055, SRI6 results were consistent with the primary efficacy endpoint analysis. The odds of being 
a SRI6 responder at Week 52 was greater for Paediatric subjects in the belimumab group compared with 
the placebo  group, which is consistent with the corresponding results in the 2 pivotal Phase 3 adult 
studies.

Additional efficacy analyses 
Prednisone 
The following analyses for prednisone were performed:  
• 
Percent of subjects whose average prednisone dose has been reduced by ≥25% from baseline during 
Week 44 to Week 52 (DO/TF=NR).  
•  Mean absolute changes from baseline in average daily prednisone equivalent dose (mg/kg) by visit 
(observed).  
• 
• 
Percent of subjects with any decrease in daily prednisone equivalent dose by visit (DO/TF=NR).  
Percent of subjects with any increase in daily prednisone equivalent dose by visit (LOCF). 
•  Cumulative prednisone dose at Week 52.  
The percentage of subjects who achieved ≥25% reduction in daily prednisone equivalent dose from 
baseline during Week 44 to Week 52 was 21.1% for the placebo group and 20.0% for the belimumab 10 
mg/kg group (Odds Ratio: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.29, 2.88).  
For the analysis of prednisone dose change from baseline, there were no notable differences between the 
placebo and belimumab 10 mg/kg groups (Figure 13). At Week 52, the placebo group had an adjusted 
mean (SE) decrease in prednisone dose from baseline of 6.126 (5.8251) mg/day, while the belimumab 
group had an adjusted mean decrease of 1.063 (4.6262) mg/day.

Figure 13. Prednisone Change from Baseline by Visit (Observed) (Part A) 
The percentage of subjects with any decrease in prednisone at Week 52 was 23.7% in the placebo group 
and 26.0% in the belimumab group (Odds Ratio: 1.26; 95% CI: 0.43, 3.63).  
The percentage of subjects with any increase in prednisone at Week 52 was 15.0% in the placebo group 
and 13.2% in the belimumab group (Odds Ratio: 0.85; 95% CI: 0.25, 2.96).  
The mean (SD) cumulative prednisone dose over 52 weeks was 4999.4 (10400.61) mg in the belimumab 
10 mg/kg group and 6882.7 (10024.16) mg in the placebo group.  
Comparison of Results in Sub-Populations 
To understand the efficacy of IV belimumab in different Paediatric patient subpopulations, evaluation of 
the primary endpoint, SRI response at Week 52, was performed in subgroups in BEL114055 based on 
age, baseline SELENA SLEDAI score (≤12 vs. ≥13; ≤9 vs. ≥10; ≤7 vs. ≥8), and baseline disease activity. 
For subgroups based on age and  SELENA SLEDAI score, the results were consistent with pooled data 
from the pivotal Phase 3 adult studies, with the observed difference between treatment groups and odds 
ratios vs. placebo favoring belimumab 10 mg/kg (In BEL114055, there was no statistically significant 
difference in SRI response rates between treatment groups in the subgroup of 38 subjects with positive 
anti-dsDNA and low C3 and/or C4 indicating high disease activity (target population according to current 
indication). In fact, the SRI response rate in this subpopulation was numerically lower for belimumab. 
This result is in contrast to that observed in the pivotal Phase 3 adult studies, which is possibly related 
to the small number of subjects in the subgroups in BEL114055.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The IV belimumab Paediatric study agreed in the PIP, BEL114055, consists of three phases. The study 
enrolled 93 subjects randomised to treatment with belimumab or placebo. Eligible subjects for the study 
was 5 to 17 years of age and had clinically active SLE disease, defined as a SELENA SLEDAI disease 
activity score of ≥6 at screening. Subjects had to have 4 or more of the 11 American College of 
Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for the classification of SLE either at screening or in the past. Subjects also 
had to have positive test result for anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) titer ≥1:80 and/or anti-dsDNA ≥30 IU/mL 
serum antibody. 
Patients who had severe active lupus nephritis, severe active CNS lupus, primary immunodeficiency, IgA 
deficiency or acute or chronic infections requiring management were excluded from the study.  
There are no important differences between the eligibility criteria in BEL114055 and the phase III studies 
in adults.  
Subjects were randomised into 3 cohorts. The first subjects aged 12-17 years were randomized in a 5:1 
ratio to belimumab or placebo (cohort 1). The first subjects aged 5-11 years were also randomised in a 
5:1 ratio to belimumab or placebo (cohort 2). After all subjects in cohort 1 and 2 received at least 8 weeks 
of treatment, safety review and PK analysis were conducted. Thereafter, the rest of the subjects were 
randomised in a 1:1 ratio to belimumab or placebo. All subjects received stable background 
immunosuppressive treatment. The double-blind period was 52 weeks, and was followed by an 
open-label extension. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was SRI4 response at week 52. SRI4 is defined as: ≥4 point reduction from 
baseline in SELENA SLEDAI score, AND no worsening (increase of <0.30 points from baseline) in PGA, 
AND no new BILAG A organ domain score or 2 new BILAG B organ domain scores compared with baseline 
at the time of assessment (i.e., at Week 52). The study was only powered for descriptive efficacy. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was identical to the adult intravenous trials. 
The approach to use staggered enrolment and randomisation into different cohorts to be able to conduct 
PK and safety analyses and, if found necessary, to adjust the dose before continued recruitment to 
initially Cohort 2 and eventually also Cohort 3 was endorsed by the CHMP. The GSK Safety Review Team 
(SRT) was to review available blinded safety, key biomarker and PK data and a recommendation by 
consensus was to be made regarding dose confirmation or adjustment and the initiation of the 
subsequent cohorts. The PK analysis and recommendation regarding dose confirmation or adjustment 
was also to be reviewed by the IDMC. The PK interim data reviews and IDMC safety data reviews were 
hence pre-planned and have been thoroughly described by the MAH. 
At the Cohort 1 review based on data from the first 12 randomised subjects aged 12-17 years, the 10 
mg/kg belimumab dose was confirmed.  Based on the review of Cohort 2 data, at least 10 subjects aged 
5-11 years, it was concluded that the 10 mg/kg belimumab dose was appropriate also for this age group.   
The procedures used to achieve and maintain blinding were considered sufficient by the CHMP. 
This was a safety, tolerability, PK and efficacy evaluation study. A primary efficacy endpoint and a number 
of secondary efficacy endpoints were pre-defined but efficacy as well as safety was to be analysed 
descriptively. No formal efficacy hypothesis testing was planned and the sample size was primarily based 
on feasibility. Overall, the analyses as planned and performed were considered acceptable by the CHMP.

In case of drop-outs or treatment failures, the use of a non-responder imputation was supported by the 
CHMP. In the primary efficacy analysis, subjects with baseline SELENA SLEDAI score less than 4 or 
missing SRI components at baseline were to be excluded from the analysis. In the end, one ITT subject 
in the placebo arm who did not have a baseline SELENA SLEDAI assessment was excluded and, therefore, 
did not contribute to SRI/component analyses. Regarding the definition of the ITT population, all 
randomised subjects received at least one dose; hence ITT analyses comprised all randomised subjects. 
In addition, sensitivity analyses were planned and have been performed. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 93 subjects were included, and all received at least 1 dose of study agent (ITT population).  
The study was conducted in the US, South America, Europe, and Asia. The majority of subjects were 
female (94.6%), and the mean age was 14 years (range 6 to 17 years). Patient median age was 15 years 
(range 6 to 17 years). In the 5- to 11-year-old-group (n=13) the SELENA-SLEDAI score ranged from 4 to 
13, and in 12- to 17-year-old-group (n=79) the SELENA-SLEDAI score ranged from 4 to 20. Patients in 
the belimumab group were more often Hispanic or Latino; the proportion of African descent was similar in 
both groups. 
Subjects in the placebo group had a slightly longer disease duration and a more severe disease defined by 
BILAG score. These BILAG A items were mainly mucocutaneous (n=3 in each group) and musculoskeletal 
(n=2 in the placebo group). In each group, there was one subject with renal BILAG domain A. Disease 
activity as per SLEDAI score was balanced in both groups. Subjects in the placebo group had more 
proteinuria, both in mean and with more subjects with higher proteinuria categories. Also, more subjects 
in the belimumab group were anti-ds-DNA positive and had low complement levels, indicating high 
disease activity, but the differences are small and not likely to impact the study result. 
The majority of patients were on steroids and antimalarials. The proportion of subjects with other 
immunosuppressants was slightly higher in the placebo group, which could indicate a more severe 
disease. 
The study was not powered for any formal comparisons between randomised treatments. The primary 
efficacy endpoint, SRI4 response at week 52, was achieved by 28/53 subjects (52.8%) in the belimumab 
group and 17/40 subjects (43.6%) in the placebo group. The difference was not statistically significant, 
but numerically the response rate was similar to the response rate in the phase 3 studies in adults (43.2% 
in belimumab vs 33.8% in placebo in C1056 and 57.6% in belimumab vs 43.6% in placebo in C1057). 
Also for SRI6, the response rate was numerically higher in the belimumab group vs placebo, although the 
differences were smaller than compared to the phase 3 trials in adults. 
The proportion of subjects meeting the PRINTO/ACR Juvenile SLE response definition was 32/53 subjects 
(60.4%) in the belimumab group and 14/40 (35.0%) in the placebo group.  The proportion of subjects 
with PRINTO/ACR response was higher in the belimumab group compared to placebo, regardless if 50% 
or 30% improvement was used in the definition.   
The percent change in parentGA from baseline was numerically higher in the belimumab group. No big 
difference was noted in percent change in PGA from baseline. The percent change in proteinuria increased 
in the placebo group and decreased in the belimumab group. This is an interesting finding, but the 
changes are small and it must be recalled that there were more subjects in the placebo group with 
baseline proteinuria possibly indicating a higher proportion of subjects with baseline nephritis. Therefore, 
the CHMP couldn’t draw any conclusion on this finding. 
With regards to prednisone levels, the percentage of subjects who achieved ≥25% reduction in prednisone 
dose from baseline during Week 44 to Week 52 was numerically lower for belimumab than for placebo. 
Assessment report  
EMA/547408/2019  
Page 47/88 
 
 
 
Also for mean absolute changes from baseline in average daily prednisone equivalent dose, the results 
were in favour of placebo. The percentage of subjects with any decrease from baseline in prednisone dose 
over 52 weeks was numerically higher for the belimumab group. Also, the mean cumulative prednisone 
dose was lower in the belimumab group. The higher baseline prednisone levels in the placebo group 
(mean 12.20 mg/day) than in the belimumab group (mean 9.11 mg/day) however limits the value of this 
finding. The CHMP concluded that it could not be considered that belimumab has a steroid-sparing effect 
in children. 
When comparing the primary efficacy endpoint in different subpopulations (age group, baseline SELENA 
SLEDAI score, baseline C3/C4 levels and anti-dsDNA), there was no clear difference in SRI response rates 
between treatment groups in the subgroup of 38 subjects (22 Benlysta and 16 placebo) with positive 
anti-dsDNA and low C3 and/or C4, which is the proposed target population for belimumab treatment. The 
results for subjects with positive anti-dsDNA and low C3 and/or C4 are somewhat surprising since these 
subjects responded best to belimumab in the studies in adult SLE, which led to the currently approved 
indication. In fact, the SRI response rate in the subpopulation of subjects with high disease activity 
defined as low complement C3/C4 levels or high anti-ds-DNA levels (target population according to 
current indication) was numerically lower for belimumab (8/22 subjects, 36.4%) than for placebo (6/16 
subjects, 37.5%).  However, it was recognised that the small study size does not allow any conclusions to 
be drawn from the subgroup analyses. Indeed, the study was not powered for any formal comparisons 
between randomised treatments. 
Prepubertal onset of SLE is uncommon, and more often associated to rare monogenic variants which 
sometimes lead to severe forms of the disease. Compared with individuals with disease onset during 
adulthood, young children with SLE have more commonly multiorgan disease, acute disease onset and 
ongoing active inflammation over time (Brunner et al, Ann Rheum Dis 2018;0:1–9). In study BEL114055, 
only 13 subjects were aged 5-11 years out of which 10 were treated with Benlysta. The characteristics of 
these children were similar to the adults included in the studies from which efficacy is to be extrapolated 
and the magnitude of the effect was also similar. Although data are limited, there were no important 
differences in disease characteristics between children and adults, nor between children aged 5-11 and 
older children aged ≥12 years. Therefore, the CHMP considered that the data can be extrapolated also in  
the younger population. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The rarity of the disease and the accompanying difficulties of recruiting patients to an adequately 
powered phase 3 study in paediatric SLE patients were acknowledged by the CHMP. The current study 
was not powered for a statistical comparison of superiority of belimumab vs placebo, and the assessment 
is primarily based on PK data and descriptive clinical data.  
The clinical outcome of the paediatric study is compared to the outcome from the phase 3 studies in adults 
with an equal design. There was a numerically higher response rate for the primary and most of the 
secondary endpoints for belimumab than for placebo. In the subjects aged 5-11 years included in the 
study, there were no important differences in disease characteristics between children and adults, nor 
between children aged 5-11 and older children aged ≥12 years.  
In conclusion, the clinical data allows for an extrapolation based on PK data. The differences between the 
groups are largely comparable to the differences observed in the phase 3 studies in adults, supporting an 
indication in paediatric patients aged 5 years and above.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety of belimumab in patients with SLE has been evaluated in 3 placebo-controlled intravenous 
studies and 1 placebo-controlled subcutaneous study, including a total of 674 patients with SLE exposed 
to the approved dose of 10 mg/kg IV (out of which 472 were exposed for at least 52 weeks), and 556 
patients exposed to 200 mg Benlysta subcutaneously once weekly for up to 52 weeks. 
The majority of patients were also receiving one or more of the following concomitant treatments for SLE: 
corticosteroids, immunomodulatory medicinal products, anti-malarials, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
medicinal products.  
As presented in the SmPC, where also post-marketing reports are included, adverse reactions were 
reported in 87% of Benlysta-treated patients and 90% of placebo-treated patients. The most frequently 
reported adverse reactions (≥5% of patients with SLE treated with Benlysta plus standard of care and at 
a rate ≥1% greater than placebo) were viral upper respiratory tract infections, bronchitis, and diarrhoea. 
The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions was 7% for 
Benlysta-treated patients and 8% for placebo-treated patients. 
Methods 
Safety assessments for this study were the monitoring of AEs, clinical laboratory tests (Protocol Appendix 
5), vital signs (systolic and diastolic blood pressure [sitting], heart rate, and body temperature), physical 
examinations, and immunogenicity. Adverse events of special interest (AESI) were malignant neoplasms, 
infusion/anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity reactions, all infections of special interest, 
depression/suicide/self-injury, and deaths. Subjects 12 years and older were assessed for suicidality 
using the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS; see Protocol Section 6.3.9). Children less 
than 12 years of age were not assessed with the C-SSRS as the C-SSRS has not been fully validated for 
use in children less than 12 years of age.  
The investigator or site staff were responsible for detecting, documenting and reporting events that met 
the definition of an AE or SAE. AE information volunteered by the subject, discovered by investigator 
questioning or detected by other means was collected from the start of study treatment until the 
follow-up contact. The following information on AEs was obtained:  
•  Duration (start and stop dates).  
•  Severity (mild, moderate, severe).  
•  Causality (reasonable possibility yes/no).   
•  Actions taken and outcome.  
SAEs were to be collected over the same time period as for AEs. However, SAEs assessed as related to 
study participation (e.g., investigational product, protocol-mandated procedures, invasive tests, or 
change in existing therapy) or related to a GSK concomitant medication, and all AEs of special interest 
(including serious and non-serious events) were to be recorded from the time a subject consented to 
participate in the study up to and including any follow-up contact.  
Any abnormal laboratory test result or other safety assessment (e.g., ECGs, radiological scans, vital signs 
measurements), including those that worsened from baseline, felt to be clinically significant in the 
medical and scientific judgment of the investigator was to be recorded as an AE or SAE, as appropriate per 
definition.

The CHMP noted that there are different definitions for severe adverse events and serious adverse 
events. 
Adverse events were classified according to severity: 
Grade 1- Mild - causing no limitation of usual activities (Grade 1 DMID).  
Grade 2- Moderate - causing some limitation of usual activities (Grade 2 DMID)  
Grade 3- Severe - causing inability to carry out usual activities (Grade 3 or 4 DMID). An AE that is 
assessed as severe will not be confused with an SAE. Severity is a category utilized for rating the 
intensity of an event; and both AEs and SAEs can be assessed as severe. An event is defined as 
‘serious’ when it meets at least one of the predefined outcomes as described in the definition of an 
SAE.  
Serious adverse event (SAE) is defined as follows:  
a. Results in death  
b. Is life-threatening NOTE: The term 'life-threatening' in the definition of 'serious' refers to an event 
in which the subject was at risk of death at the time of the event. It does not refer to an event, which 
hypothetically might have caused death, if it were more severe.  
c. Requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization NOTE: In general, 
hospitalization signifies that the subject has been detained (usually involving at least an overnight 
stay) at the hospital or emergency ward for observation and/or treatment that would not have been 
appropriate in the physician’s office or out-subject setting. Complications that occur during 
hospitalization are AEs. If a complication prolongs hospitalization or fulfils any other serious criteria, 
the event is serious. When in doubt as to whether “hospitalization” occurred or was necessary, the 
AE should be considered serious. Hospitalization for elective treatment of a pre-existing condition 
that did not worsen from baseline is not considered an AE.  
d. Results in disability/incapacity, NOTE: The term disability means a substantial disruption of a 
person’s ability to conduct normal life functions. This definition is not intended to include experiences 
of relatively minor medical significance such as uncomplicated headache, nausea, vomiting, 
diarrhea, influenza, and accidental trauma (e.g. sprained ankle) which may interfere or prevent 
everyday life functions but do not constitute a substantial disruption.  
e. Is a congenital anomaly/birth defect  
f. Medical or scientific judgment should be exercised in deciding whether reporting is appropriate in 
other situations, such as important medical events that may not be immediately life-threatening or 
result in death or hospitalization but may jeopardize the subject or may require medical or surgical 
intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes listed in the above definition. These should also be 
considered serious. Examples of such events are invasive or malignant cancers, intensive treatment 
in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm, blood dyscrasias or convulsions that do 
not result in hospitalization, or development of drug dependency or drug abuse.  
g. All events of possible drug-induced liver injury with hyperbilirubinaemia defined as ALT ≥ 3xULN 
and bilirubin ≥ 2xULN (>35% direct) (or ALT ≥ 3xULN and INR>1.5, if INR measured) termed ‘Hy’s 
Law’ events (INR measurement is not required and the threshold value stated will not apply to 
subjects receiving anticoagulants).  
NOTE: bilirubin fractionation is performed if testing is available. If testing is unavailable, record 
presence of detectable urinary bilirubin on dipstick indicating direct bilirubin elevations and 
suggesting liver injury. If testing is unavailable and a subject meets the criterion of total bilirubin 
Assessment report  
EMA/547408/2019  
Page 50/88 
 
 
 
≥2xULN, then the event is still reported as an SAE. If INR is obtained, include values on the SAE 
form. INR elevations >1.5 suggest severe liver injury.  
Immunogenicity 
For the immunogenicity assessment, a tiered testing approach was used. Samples were first screened for 
the presence of anti-belimumab antibodies (anti-drug antibodies [ADA]). Samples with a screening result 
above the screening cut-point of the assay were then tested to confirm specificity. If specificity was 
confirmed, samples were then tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies as well as assigning a 
relative titre for the ADA response.  
Briefly, for the binding assay, there were 3 testing steps. A screening assessment was performed which 
produces a result of positive or negative. For samples with a positive screening result, a confirmation 
assay was then carried out, which also produces a result of positive or negative. For samples with a 
positive confirmation result, a titre value was determined. Subjects confirmed positive in the binding 
assay were also further tested for the presence of neutralizing antibodies. Neutralization assay results are 
also reported as positive or negative.     
Patient exposure 
As of 08 March 2018, Belimumab has been investigated in approximately 33 completed or ongoing Phase 
1, 2, and 3 clinical studies conducted by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK). An estimated 6,841 subjects (13,690 
patient years) were exposed to belimumab in all completed and ongoing studies.  
Cumulative post-marketing exposure to belimumab is estimated to be 69,873 patient years] through 31 
December 2017. This estimate reflects exposure to both the IV formulation (69,509 patient years) and 
the SC formulation (364 patient years).  
The median (range) duration of exposure in study BEL114055 was 364 (28 to 374) days in the placebo 
group and 364 (81 to 377) days in the belimumab  10 mg/kg group. The duration of exposure in the 
pooled IV CRD adult studies was consistent with study BEL114055 (Table 19). The median duration of 
exposure was  comparable between the placebo and belimumab groups in the pooled IV CRD adult 
studies and in study BEL114055.

Adverse Events by System Organ Class 
In study BEL114055, SOCs with >20% of all subjects experiencing an AE were  infections and 
infestations (70.0% placebo, 56.6% belimumab), gastrointestinal disorders (40.0% placebo, 34.0% 
belimumab), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders  (32.5% placebo, 20.8% belimumab), 
nervous system disorders (27.5% placebo, 22.6%  belimumab), skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders (22.5% placebo, 18.9% belimumab), and general disorders and administration site 
conditions (22.5% placebo, 17.0% belimumab) (Table 22). The incidences of AEs in the belimumab 10 
mg/kg group were similar to or lower than those in the placebo group for the majority of SOCs. The 
SOCs with a notable difference (≥10% difference) between  treatment groups were infections and 
infestations (70.0% placebo, 56.6% belimumab) musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 
(32.5% placebo, 20.8% belimumab), renal and urinary disorders (17.5% placebo, 7.5% belimumab), 
and metabolism and nutrition disorders (10.0% placebo, 0 belimumab). 
The MAH states that the incidence of AEs by SOC in study BEL114055 were consistent with the pooled 
IV CRD adult studies, both in the belimumab group (all doses) and belimumab 10 mg/kg group (Table 
22).

Drug-related AEs 
The overall incidence of AEs considered by the investigator to be at least possibly related to study agent 
in study BEL114055 was 37.5% for the placebo group and 35.8% for the belimumab 10 mg/kg group. In 
the pooled data for the IV CRD adult studies, a total of 41.8% of subjects in the placebo group and 40.2% 
of subjects in the belimumab group experienced at least 1 AE that was considered by the investigator to 
be at least possibly related to study agent. Overall, the incidences of study agent related AEs were lower 
in study BEL114055 than that observed  in the pooled IV CRD adult studies. The SOC with the highest 
incidence of drug-related  AEs overall was infections and infestations in study BEL114055 (22.5% 
placebo, 11.3%  belimumab) and in the pooled IV CRD studies (21.2% placebo, 20.9% belimumab). 
When considered by preferred term in study BEL114055, drug-related AEs that occurred in more than 
1 subject in either treatment group were headache (7.5% placebo, 3.8%  belimumab), herpes zoster 
(5.0% placebo, 3.8% belimumab), blood immunoglobulin G decreased (5.0% placebo, 1.9% 
belimumab), fatigue (5.0% placebo, 0 belimumab), impetigo (0 placebo, 3.8% belimumab), nausea 
(5.0% placebo, 0 belimumab), neutropenia (0 placebo, 3.8% belimumab), transaminases increased (0 
placebo, 3.8% belimumab), and urinary tract infection (5.0% placebo, 0 belimumab). Incidences in the 
belimumab 10 mg/kg group were similar to or lower than those in the placebo group for the majority of 
drug-related AEs in study BEL114055. Drug-related AEs with incidences that were lower (more than 1 
subject difference) in the placebo group compared with the belimumab group were impetigo (0 placebo, 
3.8% belimumab), transaminases increased (0 placebo, 3.8% belimumab),  and neutropenia (0 
placebo, 3.8% belimumab). In general, no clinically meaningful  differences were observed between 
treatment groups with regard to drug-related AEs. 
The most frequent drug-related AEs by preferred term (reported in ≥3% of subjects in  any treatment 
group) in the pooled IV CRD studies were headache (5.3% placebo, 4.6% belimumab), nausea (3.9% 
placebo, 4.4% belimumab), upper respiratory tract infection  (4.3% placebo, 4.1% belimumab), and 
urinary tract infection (2.2% placebo, 3.6%  belimumab). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
In study BEL114055, SAEs were reported during Part A (double-blind phase) in  14 (35.0%) 
subjects in the placebo group and 9 (17.0%) subjects in the belimumab 10 mg/kg group (Table 
23). The SOC with the highest incidence of SAEs was infections and infestations (12.5% placebo, 
7.5% belimumab).  With the exception of the infections and infestations SOC, the incidence of 
SAEs by SOC was <10% in both treatment groups. The incidence of SAEs by SOC in the IV 
belimumab 10 mg/kg group in study BEL114055 was generally consistent with the IV CRD adult 
studies, both in the belimumab group (all doses) and belimumab 10 mg/kg  group.

Severe adverse events 
The incidence of severe AEs in study BEL114055 was higher in the placebo group (30.0%) compared with 
the belimumab 10 mg/kg group (11.3%) (Table 24). When considered by SOC, severe AEs that occurred 
in more than 1 subject in either treatment group were infections and infestations (5.0% placebo, 5.7% 
belimumab), blood and lymphatic system disorders (7.5% placebo, 0 belimumab), renal  and urinary 
disorders (2.5% placebo, 3.8% belimumab), general disorders and  administration site conditions (5.0% 
placebo, 0 belimumab), and nervous system  disorders (5.0% placebo, 0 belimumab). When considered 
by preferred term, severe AEs that occurred in more than 1 subject in  either treatment group in study 
BEL114055 were lupus nephritis (2.5% placebo, 3.8%  belimumab), chest pain (5.0% placebo, 0 
belimumab), and thrombocytopenia (5.0%  placebo, 0 belimumab). 
The incidence of severe AEs by SOC in study BEL114055 was consistent with the pooled IV CRD adult 
studies (Table 24). According to the MAH, no clinically meaningful differences in severe  AEs were 
observed between the two treatment groups in study BEL114055 compared with the IV CRD adult studies 
(Table 25).

The CHMP noted that the number of subjects experiencing severe adverse events is small, and 
conclusions are thereby hard to draw from the table above. Also, the definition used for severe adverse 
events (“causing inability to carry out usual activities”) is somewhat vague and limits the value of this 
analysis.

Deaths 
In study BEL114055, there were no deaths in the belimumab 10 mg/kg group during  Part A 
(double-blind phase) of the study.  One (2.5%) subject in the placebo group had a fatal SAE (acute 
pancreatitis). One death occurred in a subject receiving belimumab  10 mg/kg during Part B 
(open-label continuation phase) in study BEL114055 as of the  24 January 2018 data cut-off date.  
This 17-year-old subject experienced gastroenteritis and septic  shock 1 year and 325 days after 
receiving the first dose belimumab 10 mg/kg and 45 days after receiving the last dose of belimumab 
10 mg/kg during Part B (open-label continuation phase). The subject was hospitalized and treated 
with sodium bicarbonate, calcium gluconate (calcium gluconate 10%), dopamine, meropenem, 
dextrose and electrolyte solution, omeprazole, sodium bicarbonate, ceftriaxone,  sodium chloride, 
and sodium bicarbonate. The subject died due to cardio-respiratory arrest 47 days after the last dose 
of belimumab 10 mg/kg. The investigator considered that there was a reasonable possibility that the 
gastroenteritis, septic shock, and cardio-respiratory arrest were related to study agent. Other 
possible  causes of these events included azathioprine. 
Other significant adverse events 
In study BEL114055, the overall incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation of study agent during Part 
A (double-blind phase) was 12.5% in the placebo group and 5.7% in  the belimumab 10 mg/kg group 
(Table 26).

CHMP noted that hypertransaminasaemia and post herpetic neuralgia (as discussed above) led to 
The 
discontinuation of belimumab.  
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
Malignant neoplasms: 
No subjects in either treatment group had a malignant neoplasm AESI during Part A (double-blind phase) 
of the study. 
Infections: 
The overall incidence of all infections of special interest was 13.2% in the belimumab group compared 
with 7.5% in the placebo group (Table 27). The incidences of  all serious infections identified by the 
infections of special interest CMQ (2.5% placebo,  1.9% belimumab) and all opportunistic infections per 
MAH adjudication (0 placebo, 1.9%  belimumab) were low for both treatment groups. No subjects in the 
placebo group and 1 (1.9%) subject in the belimumab group had a non-serious, non-opportunistic active 
tuberculosis AESI. One (1.9%) subject in the belimumab group had a non-serious, non-opportunistic 
candida infection. No subjects in either treatment group had a sepsis AESI. 
The incidence of all herpes zoster infections was 7.5% in the placebo group and 9.4% in the belimumab 
10 mg/kg group (Table 27). The incidence of serious herpes zoster was  low and similar between 
treatment groups (2.5% placebo, 1.9% belimumab). No subjects  in either treatment group had a 
serious opportunistic herpes zoster infection per GSK adjudication. There was 1 case of non-serious, 
recurrent herpes zoster in the belimumab  group reported as an opportunistic infection. No cases of 
disseminated herpes zoster were  reported in either treatment group. No subjects in either treatment 
group had an infection AESI that led to discontinuation of study agent. 
The overall incidence of all infections of special interest AESI and herpes zoster was higher in both the 
placebo and belimumab groups in study BEL114055 compared with  the IV CRD adult studies. 
According to the MAH, there were no clinically meaningful differences in  serious infections of special 
interest AESI in the belimumab 10 mg/kg group in study  BEL114055 compared with the belimumab 
group in the IV CRD adult studies.

c.  Per sponsor adjudication. 
Not all Herpes Zoster will be recurrent or disseminated.    
The CHMP noted that according to this definition, infections were more common in the belimumab group 
compared to placebo and far more common than compared to adults. Although the number of cases is 
small, it is noted that the frequency of infections seems to be higher in children than in adults. 
Depression/suicide/self-injury:  
The incidence of depression/suicide/self-injury AESI per CMQ was 10.0% in the placebo group compared

Laboratory findings 
Haematology: 
The number and percentage of subjects in the belimumab 10 mg/kg group with either a Grade 3 or Grade 
4 post baseline value for each hematology parameter were lower than or similar to those in the placebo 
group (Table 28). No clinically meaningful differences were observed for Grade 3 or Grade 4 haematology 
parameters between the belimumab and placebo groups in study BEL114055 compared with the IV CRD 
adult studies. The overall percentages of subjects with at least a 2 grade worsening from baseline in the 
belimumab 10 mg/kg group were lower than or similar to those in the placebo group.

Electrolytes: 
In study BEL114055, 1 (2.6%) subject in the placebo group and 1 (1.9%) subject in the belimumab 10 
mg/kg group had a Grade 4 post baseline value for an electrolyte parameter (hyponatremia and 
hypernatremia,  respectively) (Table 31 and Table 32). The MAH states stat no clinically meaningful 
differences were observed for Grade 3 or Grade 4 electrolyte parameters between the belimumab and 
placebo groups in study  BEL114055 compared with the IV CRD adult studies.

Urinalysis 
For urinalysis parameters, the incidences of subjects in the belimumab 10 mg/kg group with a worsening 
of at least 2 grades from baseline were lower than or similar to that in the placebo group. 
Immunoglobulins 
Reduction of immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, and IgM) is an expected pharmacologic effect  of belimumab 
and was observed in the belimumab 10 mg/kg group compared with the  placebo group in study 
BEL114055. This same pattern was seen in the pooled IV belimumab adult CRD studies between the IV 
belimumab and placebo groups (Table 33).

Safety in special populations 
Adverse Events by Baseline Age and Cohort 3 
An overall summary of the incidence of AEs by baseline age (5-11 years [Cohort 2] and  12-17 years 
[Cohorts 1 + 3]) and Cohort 3 alone reported during Part A (double-blind phase) of the study is provided 
in Table 34. 
Table 34. Adverse Event Summary by Baseline Age Group and Cohort (ITT Population, Study BEL114055) 
The CHMP noted that no important differences were seen for adverse events between the different age 
groups. The proportion of subjects with at least 1 AE was higher in the lower age group, but there was no 
difference when compared to placebo.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Belimumab as a monoclonal antibody is not metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system. Thus, the types 
of drug interactions that occur between 1 or more drugs that compete for metabolism by this family of 
enzymes are not expected with belimumab. The population PK analysis including study BEL114055 
evaluated impact of SLE standard of care concomitant medications. According to the MAH, no significant 
effects of concomitant medications were identified. 
Post marketing experience 
The cumulative post- marketing exposure to belimumab is estimated to be 69,873 patient years based on 
data  from IQVIA [previously known as Intercontinental Medical Statistics (IMS) Health]  through 31 
December 2017. This estimate reflects exposure to both the IV formulation  (69,509 patient years) and 
the SC formulation (364 patient years). 
Routine pharmacovigilance is ongoing for belimumab for adult use. In addition, the RMP version 35 
specifies risk minimization measures including ongoing surveillance of important identified and potential 
risks. Identified risks are  hypersensitivity and infusion or injection-related systemic reactions and 
infections. 
Potential risks are progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), malignancies,  immunogenicity, 
effects on immunizations, including interactions with live vaccines, and  psychiatric events including 
depression and suicidality. 
Areas requiring confirmation or further investigation are also noted in the effective EU  RMP including 
pregnancy outcomes, the use of belimumab in elderly and paediatric patients, long-term data on B cell 
levels, SLE patient with severe active lupus nephritis or  severe active central nervous system (CNS) 
lupus, and effect of stopping treatment/treatment holidays) and the risk of rebound phenomenon. Study 
BEL114055  addressed the further investigation in Paediatric patients. 
Two belimumab registries are ongoing. HGS1006-C1124 (BEL116543/ SABLE) is a  5-year prospective 
observational registry to assess adverse events of interest and effectiveness in adults with active, 
autoantibody-positive SLE treated with or without  BENLYSTA (belimumab). The BENLYSTA Pregnancy 
Registry is a prospective cohort study. The primary objective of this registry is to evaluate pregnancy and 
infant outcomes  following BENLYSTA exposure and health status of live born infants at 1 year. 
A cumulative and periodic report of post-marketing surveillance is submitted as  scheduled in the 
belimumab Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report dated 03 May 2018. 
At the time of submission of the variation, belimumab was not approved for paediatric use in any country. 
From the launch of  BENLYSTA to 08 March 2018, the MAH has received 22 paediatric reports (4 
post-marketing and 18 spontaneous) containing 56 AEs. Of the 22 reports, 18 were medically confirmed. 
The 22 paediatric reports were received from 10 countries (8 US, 11 EU, and 3 from other regions [1 from 
Norway and 2 from Brazil]). Post-marketing exposure for patients ages 0 to 17 is not available. Adverse 
events summarized by MedDRA SOCs in decreasing order of incidence were general disorders and 
administration site conditions (11 AEs), injury, poisoning and procedural complications (10 AEs, e.g., 
drug administered to patient of inappropriate age and off-label use), nervous system disorders (9 AEs), 
infections and infestations (7 AEs), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders(6 AEs), eye disorders 
(4 AEs), respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (2 AEs),  and 1 AE in each of the blood and 
lymphatic system disorders, pregnancy, puerperium  and perinatal conditions, psychiatric disorders, 
investigations, skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, and surgical and medical procedures. None of the 
reported AEs were  considered AEs of special interest and none had a fatal outcome. Of the 56 reported 
AEs,  12 were serious and 8 of the 12 SAEs were related to belimumab. Related SAEs were haemolysis,

coccidioidomycosis, pneumonia, SLE, arthritis, mental impairment, abortion  spontaneous, and lupus 
pleurisy. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety population in study BEL114055 includes 53 subjects exposed to belimumab. All randomised 
subjects received at least one dose of study drug and is identical to the ITT population. The proportion of 
subjects with AEs, serious AEs and severe AEs were lower in the belimumab groups compared to placebo.  
The incidence of subjects experiencing at least 1 AE was 82.5% in the placebo group and 79.2% in the 
belimumab 10 mg/kg group. The incidence of subjects experiencing at least 1 SAE was 35.0% in the 
placebo group and 17.0% in the belimumab group.   
AEs that occurred more commonly in the belimumab 10 mg/kg group and at an incidence at least 1% 
greater than that observed with placebo were diarrhea (7.5% placebo, 13.2% belimumab), herpes zoster 
(7.5% placebo, 9.4% belimumab), nausea (7.5% placebo, 9.4% belimumab), rash (2.5% placebo, 7.5% 
belimumab), neutropenia (2.5% placebo, 5.7% belimumab), and transaminases increased (2.5% 
placebo, 5.7% belimumab).  
Among these AEs, the incidence of herpes zoster, neutropenia, and transaminases increased were higher 
in the belimumab group in study BEL114055 compared with the IV CRD adult studies. Leukopenia is 
included in the section 4.8 of the SmPC; however, herpes zoster and liver enzymes increase are not. One 
subject discontinued the study due to elevated liver enzymes. At the CHMP’s request, the MAH has 
discussed these findings and, based on the data, the CHMP concluded that no SmPC updates were 
required. 
Severe AEs within the SOCs injury, poisoning and procedural complications, eye disorders, immune 
system disorders, cardiac disorders, hepatobiliary disorders and neoplasms occurred more often in the 
belimumab group than in placebo. At the CHMP request the MAH presented those data, which included a 
case of pericardititis (considered a disease manifestation), a case of tachycardia (non-specific) and a case 
of papilloma (non-malignant). No safety signal emerged, and no SmPC changes were considered 
necessary by the CHMP.  
Numerically more subjects in the belimumab group had a ≥2-grade shift in level of hypernatraemia and 
hypo-/hypercalcaemia. At the CHMP request, the MAH clarified that the derangement of the electrolytes 
were very mild and occurring on single occasions. Therefore the CHMP concluded that no SmPC updates 
were necessary. 
The overall incidence of infections was 42/53 (79.2%) in the belimumab group and 33/40 (82.5%) in the 
placebo group. The overall incidence of all infections of special interest was 13.2% in the belimumab 10 
mg/kg group compared with 7.5% in the placebo group. In the 5- to 11-year-old group, infections were 
reported in 8/10 patients receiving Benlysta and 3/3 patients receiving placebo, and serious infections 
were reported in 1/10 patients receiving Benlysta and 2/3 patients receiving placebo. In the 12- to 
17-year-old group, infections were reported in 22/43 patients receiving Benlysta and 25/37 patients 
receiving placebo, and serious infections were reported in 3/43 patients receiving Benlysta and 3/37 
patients receiving placebo. This information is included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
In study BEL114055, there was one death in the placebo group (2.5%) during Part A (double-blind phase) 
of the study. The subject had a fatal SAE (acute pancreatitis). There was one death with belimumab in the 
open-label continuation phase (part B) of the study. This was a 17-year-old female who experienced 
gastroenteritis and septic shock 1 year and 325 days after receiving the first dose belimumab 10 mg/kg 
and 45 days after receiving the last dose of belimumab. Despite hospitalisation and treatment, the 
subject died due to cardio-respiratory arrest 47 days after the last dose of belimumab. The investigator 
Assessment report  
EMA/547408/2019  
Page 67/88 
 
 
 
considered that there was a reasonable possibility that the gastroenteritis, septic shock, and 
cardio-respiratory arrest were related to study agent. Because of the mode of action for belimumab with 
an increased susceptibility for infections, there is reasonable causality with belimumab in this case.  
Taking the mode of action of Benlysta into account, with suppression of B cells, the CHMP was concerned 
that treating children with Benlysta might lead to safety problems in a population who already have an 
increased susceptibility to infections. This concern was further supported by the fact that some children 
with SLE have complement defects and other deficiencies in the immune system leading to a furthermore 
increased risk for infections. In the observed data, there were no important differences in safety data 
between children aged 5-11 years and children aged 12 and above, however the data are limited in the 
5-11 years group. At the CHMP request, the MAH committed to review the possibility to undertake a PASS 
within established registries, to further characterise the safety of Benlysta in children with SLE, with 
particular focus on infections. If such a study is considered feasible, then the PASS is to be included in the 
RMP as a category 3 commitment. The MAH has also committed to conduct targeted follow-up 
questionnaires on infections for paediatric patients 5 to 11 years of age. In addition, the MAH has 
strengthened the section 4.4 of the SmPC to indicate that the mechanism of action of belimumab could 
increase the risk for the development of infections in adults and children with lupus, including 
opportunistic infections, and that younger children may be at increased risk. The section 4.8 of the SmPC 
was also updated to mention that the safety data in children younger than 12 years of age (n=10) are 
limited and to include a specific paragraph on infections in the paediatric population. 
Of note, the occurrence of fatal events and infections with belimimab is being reviewed as part of the 
ongoing PSUSA procedure (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00009075/201903) and will also be assessed with the 
submission of the data from the Annex II condition “The MAH shall provide the 1 year data report on a 
randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled large safety study, based on a protocol agreed with CHMP. 
The study will evaluate over a minimum of 1 year the incidence of all-cause mortality and adverse events 
of special interest in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus. These adverse events of special interest 
include serious infections (including non serious and serious opportunistic infections and PML, 
malignancies (including non melanoma skin cancer), serious infusion and hypersensitivity reactions, and 
serious psychiatric events including mood disorders, anxiety and suicide” due in December 2019. The 
Committees will carefully review the data available and their potential implications on the paediatric 
population. 
Considering the limited data on long-term safety (infections, other autoimmune diseases, 
immunogenicity and malignancies) in paediatric patients, this was included as missing information in the 
RMP and the MAH committed to the evaluation of safety (adverse of special interest, including infections, 
other autoimmune disease, immunogenicity, and malignancies) and efficacy data from paediatric studies. 
No subjects in either the belimumab 10 mg/kg or placebo group had a transient or persistent positive 
anti-belimumab immunogenic response during Part A (double-blind phase) of study BEL114055. The ADA 
incidence was low also in the adult Benlysta studies.  
No important differences were seen with regards to immunoglobulin levels or adverse events between the 
different age groups. The proportion of subjects with at least 1 AE was higher in the lower age group, but 
there was no difference when compared to placebo. 
The post-marketing experience of Benlysta in children is limited. There have been 22 reports regarding 56 
AEs in paediatric patients. These include SLE-associated features strongly confounded by the disease 
itself. No new important safety signals were identified.

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile observed in paediatric patients is largely similar to the safety profile observed 
in adults. A more favourable safety profile for Benlysta than for placebo was seen in the study in children, 
although these data are limited.  
There are no important differences in the observed safety data between children aged 5-11 years and 
children aged 12 and above. However, the data are limited in the 5-11 years group. At the CHMP request, 
the MAH has strengthen the wording in the SmPC to indicate that the mechanism of action of belimumab 
could increase the risk for the development of infections in children with lupus, including opportunistic 
infections, and that younger children may be at increased risk. 
Considering the risk of infections with Benlysta, the MAH committed at the CHMP request to review the 
possibility to undertake a PASS within established registries, to further characterise the safety of Benlysta 
in children with SLE, with particular focus on infections. If such a study is considered feasible, then the 
PASS is to be included in the RMP as a category 3 commitment. This commitment was considered 
adequate by the CHMP to monitor the safety in the paediatric population. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 35 is acceptable.  
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of 
Annex I of the RMP template, reflecting the final RMP agreed at the time of the Opinion should be 
submitted to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 35 with the following content:

Agency/QRD template, SmPC guideline and other relevant guideline(s) [e.g. Excipients guideline, storage 
conditions, Braille, etc…], which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP: 
•  Section 4.4 of the SmPC for both formulations was updated to include a statement on traceability in line 
with the Guideline on good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP) (EMA/168402/2014 Corr) P.II.B.1.1.4. 
RMP part V “Risk minimisation measures”. A reciprocal statement has been added to section 2 of the PL.  
•  Among those changes, section 6.4 of the SmPC an Section 5 of the PL for Benlysta solution for injection 
in pre-filled pen and pre-filled syringe, 200 mg were updated to include in-use storage conditions 
proposed for alignment with the QRD template (which states that the in-use shelf life should be included 
in this section) and consistency with the approved ‘Instructions for Use’ (IFU) which already included the 
inuse storage conditions. The stability data to support the in-use storage conditions were submitted in 
modules 3.2.P.2.6 (section 4) and 3.2.P.8.1 (section 7) of the Benlysta subcutaneous line extension 
(EMEA/H/C/002015/X/0046/G).  
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
“Consultation with target patient groups” was conducted as part of the original Marketing Authorisation 
Application (MAA). The changes to the package leaflet are minimal and do not require further user 
consultation with target patient groups. 
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Benlysta (belimumab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as a Post-authorisation safety study is on-going.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
SLE predominantly affects female patients between the ages of 15 and 40, and in approximately 10-20% 
of SLE patients, disease onset occurs prior to 20 years of age [Aggarwal, 2015; Kamphuis, 2010; 
Klein-Gitelman, 2002; Malattia, 2013]. Regardless of age of onset or time of diagnosis, SLE patients share 
many immunogenetic and serologic similarities [Aggarwal, 2015; Barron, 1993; Livingston, 2012; Mina, 
2013]. It has been reported that there are some differences in clinical features in childhood-onset SLE 
[Aggarwal, 2015; Brunner 2008; Costallat, 1994; Mina, 2013; Tucker, 1995]. 
Prepubertal onset of SLE is uncommon, and more often associated to rare monogenic variants, for 
example mutations in the complement system. Paediatric SLE patients tend to have more active disease 
Assessment report  
EMA/547408/2019  
Page 80/88 
 
 
 
both at the time of diagnosis and over time [Kamphuis, 2010; Livingston, 2012; Mina, 2013]. In a study 
by Brunner et al, the mean Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index (SLEDAI) score in 
Paediatric SLE patients at diagnosis was 1.7 times the score in adult SLE patients (16.8 vs. 9.3, 
respectively) [Brunner, 2008]. SLE in children can be associated with more rapid accrual of damage and 
may have a higher degree of morbidity compared with SLE in adult populations [Brunner, 2008; 
Kamphuis, 2010; Levy, 2012; Malattia, 2013; Tucker, 2008]. In a global study by the PRINTO, damage 
was present in 58.2% of the patients who had disease duration more than 5 years [Gutiérrez-Suárez, 
2006]. The range of organ involvements in Paediatric SLE is generally similar to adult SLE with some 
manifestations more prevalent in children, such as renal lupus, malar rash, seizures, oral ulcers, 
hemolytic anemia, and thrombocytopenia [Aggarwal, 2015; Barron, 1993; Brunner, 2008; Fonseca, 
2018; Mina, 2013; Webb, 2011]. Glomerulonephritis and neurologic involvement represent significant 
disease burden in SLE and occurred at higher frequency in Paediatric SLE [Amaral, 2014; Ambrose, 2016; 
Barron, 1993; Fish, 1977; Fonseca, 2018; King, 1977; Tarr, 2015; Tucker, 2008]. Growth failure and 
delayed puberty are complications of SLE specific to children that may have a serious psychological 
impact. The frequency of both events increased significantly with the increase in disease duration 
[Gutiérrez-Suárez, 2006]. 
Relative risk of mortality is higher in Paediatric SLE populations than adult SLE populations [Ambrose, 
2016; Hersh, 2010; Tucker, 2008]. In a case-control analysis of Paediatric SLE (≤18 years old at 
diagnosis) and adult SLE (19-49 years old at diagnosis) patients, mortality after a mean 4.4 years of 
follow-up was 19.4% in Paediatric SLE patients compared to 10.4% in adult SLE patients [Tucker, 2008]. 
Major causes of death in Paediatric SLE and adult SLE include renal disease, severe disease flares, and 
infections [Bernatsky, 2006; Cervera, 2006; Glidden, 1983; González, 2005]. 
SLE incidence and prevalence increase with age during childhood, and diagnosis is uncommon in children 
aged ≤9 years [Hiraki, 2012; Lim, 2009; Nightingale, 2007; Somers, 2007]. In a US study of claims data, 
the incidence of SLE was 0.13, 1.92 and 6.40 per 100,000 per year in children aged 3 to <6, 9 to <12 and 
15 to <18 years of age [Hiraki, 2012]. In a population based study in the United Kingdom, 0 and 1 
incident case were identified in children aged <10, and 10-19 respectively [Hopkinson, 1993]. A 
limitation of these estimates is that they are based on small sample sizes and are therefore subject to 
some uncertainty.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Currently no treatments are approved for SLE in Paediatrics. The clinical evidence of effective treatment 
of childhood rheumatic diseases including SLE is generally based on anecdotal reports [Lehman, 1997]. 
Similar to adult-onset disease, Paediatric SLE is a chronic disease for which there is no cure. All patients 
require life-long treatment with a variety of medications for disease control. Generally, children are 
treated with the same agents which have been used in the adult population such as corticosteroids, 
anti-malarial agents, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cytotoxic agents, and 
immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory agents [Brocard, 2005; Chatham, 2001; Houssiau, 2004; 
Midgley, 2014; Petri, 2001; Reveille, 2001; Ruiz-Irastorza, 2001; Wallace, 2002].  
Paediatric SLE is more often treated with high doses of corticosteroids than adult SLE, contributing to the 
increased incidence and earlier onset of long term organ damage in children [Mina, 2010]. More frequent 
use of immunosuppressants or IV cyclophosphamide was also reported. These therapies can be 
associated with significant toxicity including increased risks of infections or cancer [Chatham, 2001; 
Silva, 2016].

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The belimumab clinical development program that led to the IV BENLYSTA marketing approval only 
included patients aged 18 years or older.  
The IV belimumab Paediatric study agreed in the PIP, BEL114055, consists of three phases as 
summarized in the table below. The study enrolled 93 subjects randomised to treatment with belimumab 
or placebo. Eligible subjects for the study was 5 to 17 years of age and had clinically active SLE disease, 
defined as a SELENA SLEDAI disease activity score of ≥6 at screening. Subjects had to have 4 or more of 
the 11 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for the classification of SLE either at screening or 
in the past. Subjects also had to have positive test result for anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) titer ≥1:80 
and/or anti-dsDNA ≥30 IU/mL serum antibody. 
Key exclusion criteria included active central nervous system (CNS) lupus or severe renal deficiency.  
Belimumab concentrations were collected in 53 Paediatric SLE subjects (study BEL114055, part A) and 
analysed with a population PK analysis. PK samples were measured on the day of dosing (Days 0, 14, 28, 
56, 168, and 364) and a minimum of 6 samples per individual were collected. The belimumab population 
PK model previously developed for an adult SLE population [Report HGS1006-POPPK], two 
compartmental with zero-order infusion and first-order elimination, was taken as the starting model used 
to characterize the PK of the Paediatric population. Structural model parameters and covariate effects 
were estimated using Paediatric data only. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was SRI4 response at week 52. SRI4 is defined as: ≥4 point reduction from 
baseline in SELENA SLEDAI score, AND no worsening (increase of <0.30 points from baseline) in PGA, 
AND no new BILAG A organ domain score or 2 new BILAG B organ domain scores compared with baseline 
at the time of assessment (i.e., at Week 52). The study was only powered for descriptive efficacy. 
A brief description of the study is shown in Table 38.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
The belimumab population PK model for the Paediatric population described the data reasonably well and 
was similar to the population PK model described for the adult SLE population. The steady-state exposure 
Assessment report

Page 82/88 
 
 
 
 
parameters Cmax, Cmin, Cavg, and AUC were similar between the age and weight groups with a trend 
towards slightly higher exposure in the older compared to the younger age group. Exposure parameters 
for both Paediatric age groups and the overall Paediatric population were consistent with the adult 
exposure parameters with largely overlapping confidence intervals. Geometric mean 
Cmax,ss=305/317/311 [µg/mL] and AUC=2569/3126/2811 [day µg/mL] in 5-11 years old, 12-17 years 
old, and adults, respectively. The proposed dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg to all SLE patients was endorsed 
by the CHMP. 
The primary clinical efficacy endpoint, SRI4 response at week 52, was achieved by 28/53 subjects in the 
belimumab group (52.8%) and 17/40 subjects (43.6%) in the placebo group. The difference was not 
statistically significant, but numerically the response rate was similar to the response rate in the phase 3 
studies in adults (43.2% in belimumab vs 33.8% in placebo in C1056 and and 57.6% in belimumab vs 
43.6% in placebo in C1057). Also for SRI6, the response rate was numerically higher in the belimumab 
group vs placebo, although the differences were smaller than compared to the phase 3 trials in adults. 
The proportion of subjects with PRINTO/ACR response was higher in the belimumab group compared to 
placebo, regardless if 50% or 30% improvement was used in the definition.   
Among other secondary endpoints, the percent change in parentGA from baseline was numerically higher 
in the belimumab group.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
SLE in children is very rare, and an adequately powered study to address these safety concerns is not 
considered feasible.  
SLE with pre-pubertal onset is uncommon and more often associated to rare monogenic variants which 
sometimes lead to severe forms of the disease and an increased susceptibility to infections. In study 
BEL114055, only 13 subjects were aged 5-11 years out of which 10 were treated with Benlysta. Although 
data are limited, there were no important differences in the clinical study in disease characteristics 
between children and adults, nor between children aged 5-11 and older children aged ≥12 years. Whilst 
the data is sparse the CHMP acknowledges the high unmet medical need and that the efficacy response in 
the 10 patients aged 5-11 treated with belimumab numerically similar to the older age group of 12-18, 
supporting extrapolation of efficacy. 
The SRI response rate in the subpopulation of subjects with high disease activity defined as low 
complement C3/C4 levels or high anti-ds-DNA levels (target population according to current indication) 
was numerically lower for belimumab (8/22 subjects, 36.4%) than for placebo (6/16 subjects, 37.5%). 
However, the CHMP was of the opinion that the small study size does not allow any conclusions to be 
drawn from the subgroup analyses. Indeed, the study was not powered for any formal comparisons 
between randomised treatments. 
There was no steroid-sparing effect found for belimumab. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The incidence of subjects experiencing at least 1 AE was 82.5% in the placebo group and 79.2% in the 
belimumab 10 mg/kg group. The incidence of subjects experiencing at least 1 SAE was 35.0% in the 
placebo group and 17.0% in the belimumab group.   
The incidence of severe AEs in study BEL114055 was higher in the placebo group (30.0%) compared with 
the belimumab 10 mg/kg group (11.3%). Severe AEs that occurred in more than 1 subject in either 
treatment group were infections and infestations (5.0% placebo, 5.7% belimumab), blood and lymphatic 
system disorders (7.5% placebo, 0 belimumab), renal and urinary disorders (2.5% placebo, 3.8% 
Assessment report  
EMA/547408/2019  
Page 83/88 
 
 
 
belimumab), general disorders and administration site conditions (5.0% placebo, 0 belimumab), and 
nervous system disorders (5.0% placebo, 0 belimumab).  
In study BEL114055, there was one death in the placebo group (2.5%) during Part A (double-blind phase) 
of the study. The subject had a fatal SAE (acute pancreatitis). There was one death with belimumab in the 
open-label continuation phase (part B) of the study. 
The overall incidence of infections was 42/53 (79.2%) in the belimumab group and 33/40 (82.5%) in the 
placebo group. The overall incidence of all infections of special interest was 13.2% in the belimumab 10 
mg/kg group compared with 7.5% in the placebo group.  At the CHMP request, the MAH has strengthened 
the section 4.4 of the SmPC to indicate that the mechanism of action of belimumab could increase the risk 
for the development of infections in adults and children with lupus, including opportunistic infections, and 
that younger children may be at increased risk. 
Overall, the safety profile observed in paediatric patients is largely similar to the safety profile observed 
in adults.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Taking the mode of action of Benlysta into account, with suppression of B cells, the CHMP was concerned 
that treating children with Benlysta might lead to safety problems in a population who already have an 
increased susceptibility to infections. This concern was further supported by the fact that some children 
with SLE have complement defects and other deficiencies in the immune system leading to a furthermore 
increased risk for infections. In the observed data, there were no important differences in safety data 
between children aged 5-11 years and children aged 12 and above, however the data are limited in the 
5-11 years group. At the CHMP request, the MAH committed to review the possibility to undertake a PASS 
within established registries, to further characterise the safety of Benlysta in children with SLE, with 
particular focus on infections. If such a study is considered feasible, then the PASS is to be included in the 
RMP as a category 3 commitment. The MAH has also committed to conduct targeted follow-up 
questionnaires on infections for paediatric patients 5 to 11 years of age. In addition, the MAH has 
strengthened the section 4.4 of the SmPC to indicate that the mechanism of action of belimumab could 
increase the risk for the development of infections in adults and children with lupus, including 
opportunistic infections, and that younger children may be at increased risk. The section 4.8 of the SmPC 
was also updated to mention that the safety data in children younger than 12 years of age (n=10) are 
limited and to include a specific paragraph on infections in the paediatric population. Those measures  
were considered adequate by the CHMP in view of the extension of indication in the paediatric population.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In this application, the MAH seeks approval for treatment of paediatric patients with SLE aged 5-17 years. 
The basis for the application is a phase 2 study, agreed in the PIP at the approval of Benlysta. The study 
was not powered for formal comparisons between Benlysta and placebo, and the efficacy and safety 
needs to be extrapolated to children using PK data and a numerical comparison of the clinical results 
between the paediatric and adult studies. 
An adequate population PK analysis of the Paediatric study show that the PK properties of belimumab in 
the Paediatric population are similar to those in the adult population. Model predicted belimumab plasma 
exposure display similar levels between the adult and Paediatric populations across all body weights. The 
proposed dosing regimen of 10 mg/kg to all SLE patients was endorsed by the CHMP. 
The most important favourable clinical effect is the SRI response rate, which was numerically in favour of 
Benlysta. In the proposed target population of children with high disease activity defined as low 
complement and/or anti-ds-DNA antibodies, Benlysta was numerically inferior to placebo. However, the 
CHMP was of the opinion that the small study size does not allow any conclusions to be drawn from the 
subgroup analyses. Indeed, the study was not powered for any formal comparisons between randomised 
treatments. 
The benefit of treatment with Benlysta in children from study BEL114055 could be considered as modest 
as for the adult population. 
At the approval of Benlysta it was concluded that the effect of belimumab was shown in a population with 
mainly mucocutaneous and musculoskeletal involvement. The rather modest benefit shown in one of the 
two adult phase 3 studies (Study C1056) was mainly driven by the effect on a highly sensitive score 
(SELENA-SLEDAI) of disease activity, with a questionable dose-response effect and, more importantly, 
without a clear clinical translation on more straightforward interpretable variables (PGA, BILAG). In the 
subgroup of patients with positive anti dsDNA antibodies and low complement, however, the magnitude 
of effect was more pronounced. The data on maintenance of effect was also more convincing in these 
subgroups. This led to a narrowing of the indication to subjects “with a high degree of disease activity (e.g 
Assessment report  
EMA/547408/2019  
Page 85/88 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
positive anti dsDNA and low complement)”. This high degree of disease activity is only defined by 
laboratory parameters, and that subjects with severe organ- or life-threathening disease where there is 
a great unmet medical need are not eligible for treatment with Benlysta, but rather subjects with a mild 
form of disease, usually presenting with symptoms from skin and joints. 
Apart from the medical need in patients with organ- or life-threatening disease, there is a need for 
corticoid steroid-sparing agents in children, also in those with a more limited disease. In the phase 3 
studies submitted at the time of the initial marketing authorisation for Benlysta, the effect on disease 
activity was accompanied by a modest corticosteroid sparing effect. There was no steroid-sparing effect 
found for belimumab in this paediatric study. 
Compared with individuals with adult-onset disease, children with SLE have more commonly multiorgan 
disease, acute disease onset and ongoing active inflammation over time. SLE with childhood onset is also 
more often associated to rare complement mutations with an increased susceptibility to infections. In 
study BEL114055, there were only 13 subjects aged 6-11 years, out of which 10 were treated with 
Benlysta.  The disease characteristics of the children included in the clinical trial were similar to the adults 
included in the studies from which efficacy is to be extrapolated and the magnitude of the effect was also 
similar.  
No new safety signals were observed in the paediatric population 12 years of age and above (n=43). 
Safety data in children younger than 12 years of age (n=10) are limited. 
A more favourable safety profile for Benlysta than for placebo was seen in the study in children, although 
these data are limited. 
There are no important differences in the observed safety data between children aged 5-11 years and 
children aged 12 and above. However, the data are limited in the 5-11 years group. At the CHMP request, 
the MAH has strengthen the wording in the SmPC to indicate that the mechanism of action of belimumab 
could increase the risk for the development of infections in children with lupus, including opportunistic 
infections, and that younger children may be at increased risk. 
Considering the risk of infections with Benlysta, the MAH committed at the CHMP request to review the 
possibility to undertake a PASS within established registries, to further characterise the safety of Benlysta 
in children with SLE, with particular focus on infections. If such a study is considered feasible, then the 
PASS is to be included in the RMP as a category 3 commitment.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In summary, although SLE in small children is considered to have some different ethiopathogenesis and 
clinical course compared to adult and adolescent SLE, the extension of indication of Benlysta to paediatric 
patients is considered approvable for the following reasons: 
• 
• 
The extrapolation is mainly based on PK data, showing a similar exposure in children as in adults. 
The limited clinical data available indicate similar efficacy in children as in adults. Taking all available data 
together there is sufficient data in support of efficacy also in the smallest children.  
•  A more favourable safety profile for Benlysta than for placebo was seen in the study in children, although 
these data are limited. However, experience from adults show increased risk for infections, and there is 
an ongoing discussion, based on adult data, that Benlysta adversely affects the clinical course of an 
infection e.g. enhancing the risk for mortality due to infection. This is a main safety concern in children, 
and particularly for the youngest, in whom the SLE disease characteristics may make them even more 
susceptible compared to adolescents and adults. 
Assessment report  
EMA/547408/2019  
Page 86/88 
 
 
 
• 
• 
The safety of Benlysta treatment in children will be carefully monitored post-approval as described in the 
RMP. 
The MAH has strenghted the SmPC to further emphasise the concern of an increased susceptibility to 
infections in the paediatric population. 
The described similarity of belimumab PK in adults and children supports the proposed posology and the 
extrapolation of the efficacy and safety results for Benlysta in adults to the paediatric population aged 5 
to 17 years. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Benlysta is positive as add-on therapy in children aged 5 years and older with active, 
autoantibody- positive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with a high degree of disease activity (e.g., 
positive anti dsDNA and low complement) despite standard therapy.

Extension of indication to include patients aged 5 years and older in the current approved indication for 
Benlysta (belimumab powder for solution for infusion 120 mg/ml and 400 mg/ml) based on the results of 
the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetics study in patients aged 5 years to 17 years (BEL114055). As a 
consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC are updated with safety and 
efficacy information. 
Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.1, 5.2 and 6.4 of the SmPC for Benlysta (belimumab, solution for injection 
in pre-filled pen and pre-filled syringe, 200 mg) to reflect the paediatric data available for the intravenous 
formulation.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, GlaxoSmithkline Biologicals SA 
submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 20 December 2019 an application for a variation. 
The following changes were proposed: 
Variation requested

affected 
C.I.3.b  
C.I.3.b - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL intended 
Type II 
I, II, IIIA 
to implement the outcome of a procedure concerning 
and IIIB 
PSUR or PASS or the outcome of the assessment done 
under A 45/46 - Change(s) with new additional data 
submitted by the MAH 
Update of sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC based on final results from study HPV-019 listed as a 
category 3 study in the RMP; this is a safety and immunogenicity study of Cervarix in HIV-positive 
female subjects aged 15-25 years as compared to HPV-4, which was already submitted in P46.  
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to reflect an update in 
section 4.2 of the SmPC to indicate that limited clinical data is now available in 4-6 years old children 
based on study HPV-073 following assessment in P46/090; this is a safety and immunogenicity study 
of Cervarix in girls aged 4-6 years, as an alternative to the current adolescent HPV vaccination 
schedule.  
The RMP version 21.0 has also been submitted to reflect the availability of the final results of the HPV-
019 and HPV-073 studies, and the use of Cervarix in HIV-infected subjects or subjects with known 
immune deficiencies has been removed as missing information.  
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to bring the PI in line with the latest QRD template version 
10.1.  
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, 
Labelling and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Within this type II variation, the MAH is providing the results from study HPV-019 and HPV-073, 
already assessed within the context of Article P46 procedures, and the consequential amendments to 
the product information.

HPV-019: phase IV, multi-centre, observer-blind, controlled, randomised (1:1) study, with 
2 groups, stratified by HIV infection status (positive or negative) and by age (15-17 years 
and 18-25 years) in Brazil, Estonia, India and Thailand. 
HPV-073: phase III, single-blinded, randomised, controlled, multicentre study with 2 
parallel groups in healthy girls 4 to 6 years of age at the time of vaccination in Colombia, 
Mexico and Panama.  
There is evidence for multiple biological interactions between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and 
Assessment report

human papilloma virus (HPV)1. These interactions have several important clinical, epidemiological and 
public health implications. In particular, the excess burden of HPV in Person Living with HIV (PLHIV) 
has implications for the clinical management of PLHIV requiring more frequent screening, follow-up 
and management of precancerous lesions due to HPV. HPV vaccination, which has been proven to be 
safe and immunogenic among PLHIV2, may confer particular benefit to this group, and help to control 
HPV infections and related cancer more efficiently at population-level. Recent modelling studies 
suggest that as PLHIV are disproportionately infected with HPV they are more likely to transmit it 
making them an important group for focused HPV prevention. Interventions such as HPV vaccination 
could in theory have additional indirect benefits on HIV/AIDS, even if the relative risk of HIV 
acquisition due to HPV is modest. Given the burden of HPV and HIV and abundance of co-infections, 
HPV vaccination could prevent a non-negligible number of AIDS deaths particularly in Sub-Saharan 
Africa.  
Immunocompromised patients, particularly HIV-infected patients with CD4 cell counts <200 
cells/microL, are at especially high risk for HPV-related disease3. HPV vaccination with a three-dose 
schedule (at 0, 1 to 2, and 6 months) is recommended for all immunocompromised patients through 
26 years of age if they have not already been vaccinated.  
Direct efficacy data on HPV vaccination in immunocompromised hosts are lacking. Efficacy data are 
emerging in patients with HIV, but they are not conclusive. In a study of females older than nine years 
with HIV who received quadrivalent vaccination, the incidence of new persistent vaccine-type HPV 
infection was 1.1 per 100 person-years; this rate was higher than that reported in cohorts of women 
without HIV4. No cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or worse were detected in women with 
normal baseline cytology.  
Studies of the HPV quadrivalent vaccine in adult men with HIV, women aged 16 to 23 years with HIV, 
and boys and girls aged 7 to 12 years with HIV suggest that it is both immunogenic and safe in these 
populations5. However, in one study, seroconversion rates and titers were lower among perinatally 
infected HIV-positive youth compared with perinatally exposed but HIV-negative youth6. Some studies 
suggest a less robust and shorter-lived immune response in the setting of HIV infection7. 
The risk of HPV infection and subsequent cervical intraepithelial neoplasia lesions is higher in HIV+ 
females [WHO, 2017], but a humoral response to HPV antigens can still be mounted in this 
immunocompromised population. Thus, vaccination against HPV is likely to be beneficial for the high-
risk group of HIV+ females.  
In clinical trials, Cervarix has demonstrated clinical efficacy against cervical lesions and cancer 
associated with HPV 16/18 in females aged >15 years, and its efficacy was inferred in the 9–14-year 
old age group through immunogenicity bridging. In the HPV-019 study, Cervarix was proven to be 
superior to quadrivalent HPV comparator vaccine, in terms of HPV-16/18 neutralising antibodies, in 
asymptomatic HIV+ woman aged 15–25 years. The vaccine was immunogenic and seroconversion

rates and antibody levels remained sustained until study conclusion, at Month 24. In subjects who 
received Cervarix, the cell mediated immune (CMI) response in HIV+ subjects was similar to that 
observed in HIV- subjects, up to one month post-dose 3. No safety concern for use of Cervarix in HIV+ 
women was identified in the HPV-019 study. Overall, the results of the HPV-019 study indicate that 
Cervarix is immunogenic and well tolerated in asymptomatic HIV+ females 15–25 years of age. 
Of note, in a head-to-head comparison of the immunogenicity of quadrivalent and bivalent HPV 
vaccines in females aged 18 to 45 years, immunization with the bivalent vaccine induced geometric 
mean titers (GMT) of serum neutralizing antibodies 2.3- to 4.8-fold higher for HPV 16 and 6.8- to 9.1-
fold higher for HPV 18 across all age strata compared with the quadrivalent vaccine8. However, 
whether the induction of higher serum titers against HPV 16 and 18 has any impact on the degree and 
duration of protection is unknown. 
As a result of these data, sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated to indicate the availability, no 
longer limited, of immunogenicity data for asymptomatic HIV infected subjects and to indicate the 
superiority of immune responses (neutralizing antibodies GMT ratios) to both HPV-16 and HPV-18 
antigens with Cervarix compared to quadrivalent HPV vaccine, at month 7 in HIV infected subjects. 
In the HPV-073 study, 2 doses of Cervarix administered to girls aged 4–6 years induced a high and 
sustained immune response, with seropositivity rates that were similar to those observed in young 
adolescent girls. Seroconversion was 100% after 2 vaccine doses, and seropositivity was maintained 
up to 36 months. No data concerning vaccine efficacy in this age group are available and the Company 
is not seeking to recommend vaccination of 4–6-year old girls. A clinically-acceptable safety profile is 
well-established for Cervarix in all indicated ages (9 years and above) and has not changed after 12 
years of post-marketing surveillance in the large population exposed to Cervarix vaccination. In the 
HPV-073 study, the frequencies of adverse events (AEs) after administration of Cervarix were 
comparable with those in controls who received any of the comparator non HPV-vaccine. The data 
provided are acceptable though some limitations of the study HPV-073 are to be considered, such as a 
lack of an immunogenicity control group and the data collected were from pre-school population from 
Latin American countries only with no assessment of vaccine efficacy. Of note, vaccine efficacy results 
in this pre-school population are not available. 
As a result of this study, section 4.2 of the SmPC is updated to indicate that the use of Cervarix is not 
recommended in children below 9 years of age “due to limited data on safety and immunogenicity in 
this age-group”, while before referred to “…due to lack of data on safety and immunogenicity in this 
age-group”. 
Regarding the RMP, as a result of the assessment version 22.0 is to be approved. The changes 
warranted as a result of this procedure are:  
1.  To reflect the availability of the final results of the HPV-019 and HPV-073 studies  
2.  Update of the safety concern to remove as missing information, the “Use of HPV-16/18 vaccine in 
HIV-infected subjects or subjects with known immune deficiencies” and the “Impact of HPV-16/18 
vaccine in pregnant women who are inadvertently exposed to the vaccine”, and to remove as 
important potential risk the “Theoretical risk of acquiring vaccine-induced auto-immune disease 
after vaccination”; 
3.  Submission date for final results of supported study EPI-HPV-048 has been updated from Q2 2020 
to Q3 2020;  
4.  Module SII - Non-clinical part of the safety specification has been revised;

replacement’ and ‘Impact and effectiveness against anal lesions and cancer’ presented in tables 7 
and 8. 
The post-marketing surveillance addressing the “Impact and effectiveness of Cervarix against anal 
lesions and cancer” can be discussed in the next cyclical PSUR following the first analysis in 2021, 
providing that this will not lead to a delay in the provision of the data. Otherwise, the MAH is asked to 
provide the data via another adequate procedure. 
Following the review of the overall available data from the HPV-019 and HPV-073 studies, the CHMP 
concludes that the benefit-risk balance of Cervarix remains positive.

Study populations 
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria 
The HPV-019 study enrolled HIV seropositive or seronegative female subjects aged 15 to 25 years (at 
the time of first vaccination), for which written consent/assent was obtained either form the subjects 
and/or the subject’s parent or LAR. 
HIV seropositive subjects were judged to be seropositive according to World Health Organization 
(WHO) case definition, i.e., positive HIV antibody testing (rapid or laboratory-based enzyme 
immunoassay, confirmed by a second HIV antibody test relying on different antigens or of different 
operating characteristics and/or positive virological test for HIV or its components such as HIV-
ribonucleic acid [RNA], HIV-DNA or ultrasensitive HIV P24 antigen) [WHO, 2006]. 
The objective of the exclusion criteria was to prevent the administration of the candidate vaccine to 
individuals with any medical condition or who had/has planned administration of a product, that could 
potentially interfere with the evaluation of the immune response (such as previous vaccination against 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/PRAC/20445/2020  
Page 12/43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HPV, previous administration of MPL or AS04 adjuvants, subjects with autoimmune diseases), and to 
individuals at risk of possible adverse reaction to the vaccine.  
Subjects had to be asymptomatic regardless of their prior clinical stage. If they were currently taking 
antiretrovirals (ARVs), subjects were to be on Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapy (HAART) for at least 
one year, have undetectable viral load (i.e., viral load < 400 copies/mm3) for at least six months, and 
have a CD4 cell count > 350 cells/mm3 at study entry. HIV+ subjects diagnosed with active 
tuberculosis (TB), or subjects on TB therapy were not enrolled. No previous vaccination against HPV or 
previous administration of monophosphoryl lipid (MPL) or AS04 adjuvant was allowed.  
Demographic Characteristics (brazil, Estonia, India and Thailand) 
In the HPV-019 study, the mean age (± SD) at the time of first vaccination was 20.1 (± 3.2) years, in 
the ATP cohort for immunogenicity. Most of the study participants were Asian/of South-east Asian 
heritage (29.4%), Caucasian/of European heritage (27.9%) and Asian/of Central/South Asian heritage 
(22.6%). The study groups included only female subjects and were balanced in terms of age and 
ethnicity. 
Study Completion 
In the HPV-19 study, the Total cohort consisted of 873 subjects. Of these subjects enrolled in the 
study, 173 were excluded from all statistical analysis (subjects from the Brazilian centre excluded due 
to GCP non-compliance) and a further 154 subjects received an allocated subject number but did not 
receive a vaccine dose.  
Of the 546 subjects that were vaccinated, 448 completed the study. A total of 98 subjects were 
withdrawn from the study, the main reason being consent withdrawal (not due to an AE) for 41 
subjects, and lost to follow-up for 37 subjects with complete vaccination course; one subject (in the 
HIV+/GAR group) was withdrawn due to an SAE.

Results 
Demographic characteristics 
In the ATP cohort for immunogenicity, the mean age (± SD) at the time of first vaccination was 20.1 (
± 3.2) years. Study participants were Asian/of South-east Asian heritage (29.4%), Caucasian/of 
European heritage (27.9%) and Asian/of Central Asian heritage (22.6%). The study groups were 
balanced in terms of age and ethnicity. 
Confirmatory primary and secondary objectives 
Non-inferiority of Cervarix as compared to Gardasil immunogenicity in HIV+ subjects, in terms of HPV-
16 and HPV-18 antibody GMT ratio was demonstrated as the LL of the 95% CI for the ratio of GMTs 
(Cervarix over Gardasil) as assessed by Pseudovirion-Based Neutralization Assay (PBNA) one month 
post-dose 3 was above 0.5 for both HPV-16 and HPV-18 types (Table below). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/PRAC/20445/2020  
Page 15/43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As the first co-primary confirmatory was met, the second co-primary objective could be assessed: the 
superiority of Cervarix over Gardasil in HIV+ subjects in terms of HPV-18 and HPV-16 antibody GMT 
ratios was demonstrated as the LL of the 95% CI for the ratio of GMTs (Cervarix over Gardasil) as 
assessed by PBNA one month post-dose 3 was above 1 for both antigens with a statistically significant 
p-value (Table below). 
The secondary confirmatory objective of superiority of Cervarix compared to Gardasil immunogenicity 
in HIV- subjects in terms of HPV-16 and HPV-18 antibody GMT ratio assessed by PBNA was 
demonstrated was met, as the LL of the 97.5% CI for the ratio of GMTs (Cervarix over Gardasil) was 
above 1 for both the HPV-16 and HPV-18 types with a statistically significant p-value (TVC) (Table 
below).

Secondary objectives 
Baseline seropositivity 
By PBNA, 67.9% and 79.5% of HIV+ subjects in the HIV+/HPV and HIV+/GAR groups, respectively, 
were seronegative for antibodies against both HPV types; 96.1% and 94.9% of the HIV- subjects in 
the HIV-/HPV and HIV-/GAR groups, respectively, were seronegative for both types of antibodies at 
baseline. 
At baseline, by ELISA, 60.5% and 75.0% of HIV+ subjects in the HIV+/HPV and HIV+/GAR groups, 
respectively, were seronegative for both HPV 16 and 18 antibodies; 94.8% and 93.8% of the HIV- 
subjects, in the HIV-/HPV and HIV-/GAR groups, respectively, were seronegative for both HPV types. 
Anti-HPV-16/18 antibodies measured by ELISA 
At Month 7, all initially seronegative subjects had seroconverted for anti-HPV-16 antibodies, in all 
groups, and remained positive up to Month 24, except for group HIV+/GAR, where the 94.7% of 
subjects had seroconverted for anti-HPV-16 antibodies. The antibody GMC values were 5 110.1 
EL.U/mL, 2 065.0 EL.U/mL, 15 748.1 EL.U/mL and 5 947.8 EL.U/mL at Month 7, and 652.8 EL.U/mL, 
180.3 EL.U/mL, 1 869.3 EL.U/mL and 579.1 EL.U/mL at Month 24, in the HIV+/HPV, HIV+/GAR, HIV-
/HPV and HIV-/GAR groups, respectively. Overall, the HPV-16 antibody GMCs appeared higher in the 
HPV groups. 
At Month 7, all initially seronegative subjects had seroconverted for anti-HPV-18 antibodies, except for 
the HIV+/GAR group (96.1%). At Month 24, the percentage of subjects that seroconverted for anti-
HPV-18 antibodies was 96.3%, 67.6%, 100% and 98.5% in the HIV+/HPV, HIV+/GAR, HIV-/HPV and 
HIV-/GAR groups, respectively. The antibody GMC values were 2 892.6 EL.U/mL, 458.6 EL.U/mL, 6 
935.1 EL.U/mL and 1 498.5 EL.U/mL, at Month 7, and 292.3 EL.U/mL, 44.9 EL.U/mL, 763.3 EL.U/mL 
and 114.1 EL.U/mL at Month 24, in the HIV+/HPV, HIV+/GAR, HIV-/HPV and HIV-/GAR groups, 
respectively. As observed for HPV-16, the HPV-18 antibody GMC values appeared to be higher in the 
HPV groups.

Cell-mediated immune responses 
CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses against HPV-16/18 
Overall, CD4+ T-cell (in terms of median frequency of HPV-16/18 antigen-specific CD4+ T-cells per 
million CD4+ T-cells expressing at least 2 different immune markers [all doubles]) responses were 
detected in all groups, and appeared similar in HIV- and HIV+, and for both antigens. There was a 
trend for a higher response in the HPV groups compared to GAR groups. 
No substantial HPV-16 and HPV-18 specific CD8+ T-cell responses were detected. 
B-cell responses to HPV-16/18 
B-cell responses were expressed in terms of median frequency of HPV-16 and HPV-18 antigen-specific 
memory B-cells per million memory B-cells in a limited subset of subjects (maximum of 20 
subjects/group) with detectable B-cells. 
Overall, a trend for lower B-cell responses was observed for HPV-16 and HPV-18 in HIV+ subjects 
compared to HIV- subjects, in both HPV and GAR groups. 
Exploratory objectives 
Non-inferiority assessment of Cervarix in HIV-positive subjects vs Gardasil in HIV negative 
subjects by PBNA 
Non-inferiority of Cervarix in HIV+ subjects compared to Gardasil in HIV- subjects in terms of GMT 
ratio assessed by PBNA was shown, since the LL of the 95% CI for the ratio of GMTs (Cervarix over 
Gardasil) was above 0.5 for both HPV types.

6.2.  Discussion 
Persons with HIV are at increased risk of HPV infection, HPV disease, and HPV-related cancers 
compared to HIV negative persons. In persons with HIV, immune responses to vaccination are often 
sub-optimal, and while these improve with Anti-Retroviral Treatment, they often remain lower and 
decline more rapidly than in HIV-negative individuals. Although the evidence base to support 
the immunogenicity of HPV vaccines in HIV+ persons is reasonable, the evidence base to support 
the efficacy of HPV vaccines in HIV+ individuals is inconsistent.  
Cervarix has previously been shown to be immunogenic in 61 asymptomatic HIV+ women aged 18–25 
years from South-Africa (study HPV-020) [Denny, 2013]. Humoral and cell-mediated immunity are 
both likely to be responsible for vaccine-induced protection. The AS04 adjuvant (a combination of 
aluminium hydroxide and 3-O-desacyl-4’-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL)) included in the vaccine is 
thought to play a key role in the difference of immunogenicity and efficacy profiles between Cervarix 
and Gardasil [Herrin, 2014; Ryser, 20199].  
Therefore, the current study investigated the immunogenicity of Cervarix and Gardasil, the latter only 
containing aluminium hydroxyphosphate sulphate as adjuvant, in a population of asymptomatic HIV+ 
women, aged 15–25 of years and from 4 countries in South America, Europe, and Asia.  
The subjects were aged 15–25 years and were either HIV seropositive (asymptomatic and with an 
undetectable viral load for at least 6 months) or HIV seronegative females. The main exclusion criteria 
were: previous vaccination against HPV or with vaccines containing MPL or AS04 adjuvants, and active 
tuberculosis (TB). HIV+ subjects were judged to be asymptomatic and HIV seropositive according to 
the World Health Organization (WHO) case definition, i.e. meeting WHO criteria [WHO,  2006]. The 
randomisation was stratified according to the country, HIV infection status at baseline and age. In 
addition, HIV+ subjects were randomized according to baseline CD4 cell count and to their highly 
active anti-retroviral therapy HAART status. Subjects had to be asymptomatic regardless of their prior 
clinical stage. If they were currently taking antiretrovirals (ARVs), subjects were to be on HAART for at 
least one year, have undetectable viral load (i.e., viral load < 400 copies/mm3) for at least six 
months, and have a CD4 cell count > 350 cells/mm3 at study entry. HIV+ subjects diagnosed with 
active TB or subjects on TB therapy were not enrolled. 
At Month 7, all initially seronegative subjects had seroconverted for HPV-16 antibodies, and all except 
3 HIV+ subjects receiving Gardasil had seroconverted for HPV-18 antibodies. The immune response in 
terms of HPV-16/18 neutralising antibody titres was demonstrated to be superior following vaccination 
with Cervarix as compared to Gardasil, at Month 7. By ELISA, seroconversion rates and antibody

concentrations in the groups receiving Cervarix remained higher than those in the corresponding 
Gardasil groups for both antigens at Month 24. In the Gardasil group, seropositivity rates for HPV-18 
decreased to 67.5% by Month 24. Antibody responses were overall lower in HIV+ versus HIV- 
subjects. Immunogenicity levels achieved in HIV+ subjects vaccinated with Cervarix were comparable 
to those achieved in HIV- subjects vaccinated with Gardasil. 
In HPV-019, superiority of Cervarix over Gardasil in terms of HPV-16 and HPV-18 GMT ratio assessed 
by PBNA was also demonstrated in HIV- females. Both findings (in HIV+ and HIV- subjects) are in line 
with what was previously observed in a head to head study comparing the 2 vaccines in healthy 
women aged 18-45 years [Einstein, 2009; Einstein, 2014]. In both studies, the difference between the 
2 vaccines was more pronounced for the HPV-18 type than for HPV-16. 
Of interest, in all Cervarix recipients, the ELISA antibody GMCs for both HPV types at Month 24 
remained higher than or similar to the plateau level associated with sustained protection against HPV-
16/18 infection (397.8 EL.U/mL for HPV-16 and 297.3 EL.U/mL for HPV-18) [De Carvalho, 2010; 
GlaxoSmithKline Vaccine HPV-007 Study Group, 2009]. Moreover, antibody GMCs recorded in both 
groups at Month 24 in the HPV-019 study were more than 12 times higher (62.7 and 21.9-fold higher 
in HIV and HIV+ women, respectively, for HPV-16, and 33.8 and 12.9-fold higher in HIV- and HIV+ 
women, respectively, for HPV-18) than those recorded in women who have cleared previous natural 
HPV infection (29.8 EL.U/mL for HPV-16 and 22.6 EL.U/mL for HPV-18 [Paavonen, 2007]). A similar 
observation was reported in the HPV-007 study [GlaxoSmithKline Vaccine HPV-007 Study Group, 
2009]. 
CD4 T-cell responses (i.e., median frequency of HPV-16 and HPV-18 specific CD4 T-cells per million 
CD4 T-cells expressing at least 2 different immune markers) were detected in all groups, and were 
comparable in HIV+ and HIV- subjects for both antigens; the responses remained substantial up to 6 
months post-vaccination, similarly with previous reports from the HPV-020 study [Denny, 2013]. There 
was a trend for higher responses in Cervarix versus Gardasil groups from the second dose. Overall 
there was a trend for better memory B-cell responses with Cervarix versus Gardasil. In this study, 
anti-HPV-16/18 antibodies evaluated by ELISA in HIV+ subjects by CD4 cell count category showed a 
trend for a better response to the vaccines in subjects with a CD4 cell count >500 cells/mm3 at 
baseline compared to the subjects with baseline CD4 cell counts between >350 and  500 cells/mm3. 
This trend was not observed in the study HPV-020 (an opposite trend was observed, although the 
study sample size was limited) [Denny, 2013]. However, unlike in the HPV-019 study, women with 
CD4+T-cell count of <350 cells/mm3 were enrolled in the HPV-020 study: 2/61 and 35/61 of Cervarix 
recipients had a pre-vaccination CD4 cell count of <200 cells/mm3 and 200-500 cells/mm3, 
respectively. 
When antibody GMCs and seroconversion rates for HPV-16/18 in HIV+ women were analysed by viral 
load, a tendency for decreased immune responses in subjects with increasing viral loads was observed, 
for Cervarix and Gardasil recipients. This observation is in line with data from a study conducted in the 
United States, Brazil, and South Africa, in which HIV+ women aged 13–45 years received 3 doses of 
Gardasil (at weeks 0, 8 and 24): lower seroconversion rates for HPV-16 and 18 were observed in HIV+ 
women with a viral load of >10 000 copies/mL compared to <10 000 copies/mL [Kojic, 2014]. 
Interestingly, non-inferiority of immune response in HIV+ Cervarix recipients versus in HIV- Gardasil 
recipients, in terms of HPV-16 and HPV-18 GMT ratio assessed by PBNA, was demonstrated at Month 
7, thus providing clinically-relevant information, as the efficacy of Gardasil against HPV-caused cancers 
and intraepithelial neoplasias has already been established in HIV- women. 
The results of this 4–arm vaccine RCT in 257 HIV+ (CD4>350, women with both vertical and sexually 
transmission) & 289 HIV- women aged 15–25yrs were discussed. Both HIV+ and HIV– women were

randomised 1:1 to Cervarix or Gardasil, and serology was measured using a pseudovirion-based 
neutralizing antibody PBNA assay. At 7 months Cervarix was superior to Gardasil in the HIV positive 
females, for HPV16 by 2.74 fold (CIs 1.83–4.11) and for HPV 18 b y 7.44 (4.79–11.54) in GMTs. Both 
CD4 cell and B memory cells were assayed out to 12 months. In general, in HIV negative women, the 
cellular responses are similar to those of Einstein et al10, and in general, the responses in HIV+ women 
are similar to those in HIV- women in this study. However, the exception was memory B cell responses 
against HPV 18 in HIV+ women receiving Gardasil, which were poor with median responses of 0 across 
the whole 12 month period. Interestingly these poor anti-HPV18 responses appears to be in keeping 
with the data of McClymont et al11. Memory B cell priming induced by Gardasil to HPV 16 was also poor 
after the 1st dose with a medians of 0 spots. This data showing better immunogenicity in HIV with an 
additionally TLR agonist-adjuvanted vaccine compared to a classical alum-adjuvanted vaccine is in 
keeping with data obtained using different Hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccines in HIV12. 
In conclusion, immune response to Cervarix was superior to Gardasil in terms of HPV- 16/18 
neutralising antibodies measured by PBNA, in asymptomatic HIV+ female subjects aged 15–25 years, 
at Month 7. Humoral response was maintained until study conclusion at Month 24 in terms of high 
seroconversion rates and antibody levels. CMI response (up to Month 7) in HIV+ and HIV- subjects 
was similar and a trend for a better response was observed with Cervarix as compared to Gardasil. The 
clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. Meanwhile, evidence base to support the efficacy of 
HPV vaccines against the relevant clinical endpoints in HIV+ individuals is unavailable. No clinical 
efficacy data exist about protection against persistent infection or precancerous lesions among HIV 
infected women. Also the limited HIV+ population was limited by an important list of exclusion criteria 
which is relayed in the SmPC section 5.1. The study HPV-019 generated robust and informative data 
on the use of Cervarix in HIV+ subjects, which complement the existing information in the current PI 
and need to be described with the comment that the clinical relevance of these differences e.g. 
superiority is unknown. No clinical efficacy data exist about protection against persistent infection or 
precancerous lesions among HIV infected women.

Overview of the clinical study supporting the application 
Results 
Study population 
Healthy female subjects between, and including, 4-6 years of age at the time of the first vaccination, 
who received four doses of DTP containing vaccine (i.e., three doses in the first year of life and a 
fourth dose in the second year of life) as well as first dose of MMR vaccine according to the local 
schedule applicable in the participating countries. The primary analysis was based on the according-to-
protocol (ATP) cohort for analysis of immunogenicity. A second analysis based on the total vaccinated 
cohort (TVC) was performed to complement the ATP analysis.

In summary, the results in the population studied of girls aged 4 to 6 years support a correct antibody 
response that is comparable to the results seen in the 9 to 14 years of age. Of importance, the kinetics 
of serum antibody responses in the preteen/adolescent population receiving 2 doses of the HPV-16/18 
vaccine within a 6-month period are similar to those observed in young adult women who receive the 
standard 3-dose schedule within 6 months, suggesting that long lasting protection can be expected. 
The vaccine administered according to a 2-dose schedule at 0, 6 months in children of pre-school age 
induced a similarly high and sustained immune response seen in young adolescent girls. High 
seroconversion rates and GMTs reached for the 2 HPV types, which (although declining over time) 
were sufficiently maintained up to 36 months.  
The results were extensively discussed in the assessment report EMA/658750/2018 dated 18th October 
2018. 
6.4.  Discussion 
Two doses of Cervarix administered to healthy females aged 4–6 years induced high levels of 
antibodies that persisted until at least Month 36 (30 months post-dose 2). All subjects seroconverted 
to HPV-16 and HPV-18 after dose 2 and remained seropositive until Month 36. Few reports describing 
the use of HPV vaccines in young children were identified in the literature [Mészner, 2015; Katsuta, 
2016; Papaioannou] and data on immune responses to vaccination are scarce. Thus, in the HPV-073 
study, seropositivity rates of 100% observed up to Month 36 after 2 Cervarix doses in 4–6-year old 
girls who were seronegative prior to vaccination are consistent with rates reported after 2 doses 
administered to 9–14-year old girls in the currently approved Cervarix PI. 
Some limitations of the study HPV-073 are to be considered such as a lack of an immunogenicity 
control group, data were collected from Latin American children only, no assessment of vaccine 
efficacy was performed in this population. Of note, vaccine efficacy results in this pre-school population 
are not available. 
When the clinical study report of HPV-073 was submitted to the EMA in accordance with Art.46 of 
regulation (EC) N°1901/2006, the MAH’s position was that no update of the PI was needed. However 
in this assessment report (EMA/658750/2018), the Rapporteur considered that an update of the SmPC 
was warranted to reflect that clinical data are available in this new paediatric age group (very limited 
data, and outside the indication). The following wording was proposed in Section 4.2, with a cross-
reference to a brief description of the available data to be included in section 5.1. 
The safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of Cervarix in children below 9 years of age has not 
yet been established. Currently available data are described in section 5.1 but no 
recommendation on a posology can be made. 
Meanwhile, the MAH proposes to update section 4.2 of the PI to indicate that limited data are available 
for use of Cervarix in 4–6-year old children. The Company proposes not to add clinical data to Section 
5.1 as the Company perceives a potential risk that inclusion of data about vaccine use in 4–6-year old 
girls could lead to confusion amongst prescribers and potential off-label use of the vaccine. As there is 
no medical need to vaccinate girls aged 4–6 years with Cervarix and the Company is not aware of any 
existing public health recommendations to vaccinate this population, at this time, it is the Company’s 
position not to include the 4–6 years old age range in the vaccine indication. Although not included in 
the proposed PI, clinical data have been published and are available for the medical community [Lin, 
2018; Lin, 2019] . 
The Rapporteur agrees with the MAH’s discussion and proposal not to add clinical data to Section 5.1. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/PRAC/20445/2020  
Page 23/43 
 
 
 
 
The proposed wording by the MAH for the section 4.2 is deemed acceptable, i.e.  
‘Cervarix is not recommended for use in children below 9 years of age due to limited data on 
safety and immunogenicity in this age-group.’ 
7.  Clinical Safety aspects 
7.1.  HPV-019 
Methods – analysis of data submitted 
In the HPV-019 study, solicited local (pain, redness and swelling) and general (fatigue, fever, 
gastrointestinal symptoms, headache, arthralgia, myalgia, rash, urticaria) adverse events (AEs), and 
unsolicited AEs occurring within 7 and 30 days after each vaccination, respectively, were collected. 
SAEs were recorded from the first receipt of the study vaccine up to study end; MSCs and Potential 
Immune-Mediated Disease (pIMDs) were recorded up to 12 months post-last vaccination and followed 
up until study end.  
Primary endpoints 
•  Occurrence and intensity of solicited local symptoms within 7 days (Days 0–6) after each and 
any vaccination in HIV+ subjects.  
•  Occurrence, intensity and relationship to vaccination of solicited general symptoms within 7 
days (Days 0–6) after each and any vaccination in HIV+ subjects.  
•  Occurrence, intensity and relationship to vaccination of unsolicited symptoms within 30 days 
(Days 0– 29) after any vaccination in HIV+ subjects.  
•  Occurrence of SAEs up to 30 days after the last dose of vaccine (i.e., Month 7) in HIV+ 
subjects.  
•  Occurrence of medically significant conditions (including pIMDs) up to 30 days after the last 
dose of vaccine (i.e., Month 7) in HIV+ subjects.  
•  Occurrence and outcome of pregnancies up to 30 days after the last dose of vaccine (i.e., 
Month 7) in HIV+ subjects.  
Secondary endpoints  
•  Occurrence and intensity of solicited local and general symptoms (and relationship to 
vaccination) within 7 days (Days 0–6) after each and any vaccination in HIV subjects. 
•  Occurrence, intensity and relationship to vaccination of unsolicited symptoms within 30 days 
(Days 0–29) after any vaccination in HIV- subjects.  
•  Occurrence of SAEs and MSCs (including pIMDs) up to 30 days after the last dose of vaccine 
(i.e., Month 7) in HIV- subjects  
•  Occurrence and outcome of pregnancies throughout the study (i.e., up to Month 24) in all 
subjects.  
•  Occurrence of MSCs (including pIMDs) up to 12 months after the last dose of vaccine (i.e., 
Month 18) and SAEs during the entire study period (i.e., up to Month 24) in all subjects.

Results 
Overall, during the entire study, 273 subjects in each group received at least one dose of the study 
vaccines, and a total of 785 doses of Cervarix and 795 doses of Gardasil were administered. 
Solicited local AEs 
During the 7-day (Days 0–6) post-vaccination period, the most frequently reported solicited local AE in 
all groups was pain, reported after 80.6%, 47.4%, 81.8% and 64.3% of doses in the HIV+/HPV, 
HIV+/GAR, HIV-/HPV and HIV-/GAR groups, respectively. Grade 3 pain was reported after 3.8%, 
2.2%, 6.5% and 2.2% of doses in the HIV+/HPV, HIV+/GAR, HIV-/HPV and HIV-/GAR groups, 
respectively. 
Solicited general AEs 
During the 7-day (Days 0–6) post-vaccination period, the most frequently reported solicited general AE 
was headache (reported after 42.2%, 30.5%, 28.1% and 24.5% of doses in the HIV+/HPV, 
HIV+/GAR, HIV-/HPV and HIV-/GAR groups, respectively) followed by fatigue (reported after 34.4%, 
32.2%, 27.6% and 21.4% of doses) and myalgia (reported after 30.9%, 22.1%, 26.4% and 21.8% of 
doses). A maximum of 29.0%, 20.7%, 19.4% and 14.8% of doses in the HIV+/HPV, HIV+/GAR, HIV-
/HPV and HIV-/GAR groups were followed by at least one solicited general AE assessed by the 
investigator as causally related to vaccination. In all 4 study groups, a maximum of 3% of doses were 
followed by at least one grade 3 solicited general AE, among which no more than 2.0% were followed 
by at least one grade 3 related solicited general AE assessed by the investigator as causally related to 
vaccination. 
Unsolicited AEs 
Within the 30-day (Days 0–29) post-vaccination period, at least one unsolicited AE was reported after 
14.4%, 14.4%, 7.3% and 10.5% of doses in the HIV+/HPV, HIV+/GAR, HIV-/HPV and HIV-/GAR 
groups, respectively. No more than 2.9%, 2.1%, 1.0% and 0.5% of doses in the HIV+/HPV, 
HIV+/GAR, HIV-/HPV and HIV-/GAR groups were followed by unsolicited AEs assessed by the 
investigator as causally related to vaccination. 
The most frequently reported unsolicited symptoms considered by the investigator to have a causal 
relationship to vaccination in the HIV+/HPV group were headache and dizziness, reported by 2 
subjects (1.6%). 
Within the 30-day (Days 0–29) post-vaccination period, at least one grade 3 unsolicited AE was 
reported after 1.9%, 1.1%, 0.2% and 0.7% of doses in the HIV+/HPV, HIV+/GAR, HIV-/HPV and HIV-
/GAR groups, respectively. Only one grade 3 unsolicited AE considered by the investigator to have a 
causal relationship to vaccination was reported for one subject (0.8%) in the HIV+/HPV group 
(immune thrombocytopenic purpura); this was reported as a SAE and a pIMD.  
SAEs 
During the entire study period, a total of 23 subjects (9 in the HIV+/HPV group, 9 in the HIV+/GAR 
group, 4 in the HIV-/HPV group and one in the HIV-/GAR group) reported a total of 29 SAEs (11 in the 
HIV+/HPV group, 12 in the HIV+/GAR group, 5 in the HIV- /HPV group and one in the HIV-/GAR 
group). One SAE, which was also reported as a pIMD (immune thrombocytopenic purpura), was 
reported in the HIV+/HPV group, and was considered by the investigator to have been due to 
underlying HIV infection which may have been aggravated by the study vaccine. The other SAEs 
reported throughout the study were not considered as causally related to vaccination and resolved 
without sequelae.

Fatal SAEs 
One fatal outcome case was reported one month after dose 3, in the HIV+/GAR group (with the 
preferred term pneumonia bacterial, pulmonary tuberculosis). The subject died 6 days later due to 
acute respiratory failure, complications of pneumonia and septicaemia. The SAE was not considered to 
be causally related to vaccination by the investigator. 
Other significant AEs 
MSCs 
Up to 12 months after the last dose (Month 18), 89 subjects reported at least one MSC: 25 (19.4%) 
subjects in the HIV+/HPV group, 37 (28.9%) subjects in the HIV+/GAR, 10 (6.9%) subjects in the 
HIV-/HPV group, and 17 (11.7%) subjects in the HIV-/GAR group. 
pIMDs 
Up to Month 18, one subject (0.3%) in the HIV+/HPV group reported one pIMD (with the preferred 
term immune thrombocytopenic purpura), which was also reported as a SAE. This event was reported 
within 30 days after the third vaccine dose and was considered by the investigator to be caused by the 
underlying HIV infection, which may have been aggravated by the study vaccine. None of the HIV- 
subjects reported any pIMDs during the entire study (up to Month 18).

A total of 9 pregnancies were reported up to Month 7. Seven pregnancies (3 in the HIV+/HPV group, 
one each in the HIV+/GAR and HIV-HPV groups, and 2 in the HIV- /GAR group) resulted in live infants 
with no apparent congenital anomaly. Two pregnancies (one each in the HIV+/HPV and HIV+/GAR 
groups) resulted in spontaneous abortion with no apparent congenital anomaly.

During the entire study period, a total of 28 pregnancies were reported. The majority of pregnancies 
(89.3%) resulted in live infants with no apparent congenital anomaly. One subject (10.0%) in the 
HIV+/HPV group underwent an elective termination, and 2 subjects (7.1%; one subject each in the 
HIV+/HPV and HIV+/GAR groups) had spontaneous abortions with no apparent congenital anomaly. 
Discussion 
Cervarix, when administered in a 3-dose schedule in HIV+ female subjects, was well tolerated in the 
HPV-019 study. The incidence of solicited AEs in the HPV groups receiving Cervarix was in line with 
previous reports, with the most frequently reported local AE being pain, while the most frequently 
reported solicited general AEs were headache, fatigue and myalgia. The frequency of the solicited AEs 
was similar to that observed in 2 large pooled analyses of overall safety data from the clinical 
development program of Cervarix [Angelo, 2014; Descamps, 2009], and in the 15–25 years age group 
[Descamps, 2009]. Unsolicited AEs were also reported with comparable frequencies between Cervarix 
groups and were consistent with the safety profile described for women in this age category, and for 
HIV+ women 18–25 years in the HPV-020 study [Denny, 2013]. As expected, more MSCs were 
reported in HIV+ than HIV- subjects, but their incidence remained within that previously reported from 
clinical trials in the 15–25 years age group [Descamps, 2009]. 
Of the 39 SAEs reported by 23 subjects, only one event (with the onset on the day of the second dose) 
was considered related to vaccination: a case of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (also reported as a 
pIMD) in the HIV+/HPV group. The event was considered by the investigator to have been due to 
underlying HIV infection which may have been aggravated by the study vaccine. Of note, immune 
thrombocytopenic purpura occurs in 5–10% of HIV+ individuals [Oksenhendler, 1990]. All non-fatal 
SAEs recovered/resolved by study end. One fatal outcome (pneumonia bacterial, pulmonary 
tuberculosis) occurred in the HIV+/GAR group and was not considered related to vaccination. 
Pregnancies occurring during the study were reported in the HIV+ groups and resulted in life infants 
with no apparent congenital anomaly. One elective termination (in the HIV+/HPV group) and 2 
spontaneous abortions (one in each of the HIV+/HPV and HIV+/GAR groups) were reported. 
In conclusion, in the HPV-019 study, Cervarix had shown an acceptable clinical safety profile, 
consistent with the current PI. This is endorsed by the Rapporteur.  
7.2.  HPV-073 
Study population 
Healthy female subjects between, and including, 4-6 years of age at the time of the first vaccination, 
who received four doses of DTP containing vaccine (i.e., three doses in the first year of life and a 
fourth dose in the second year of life) as well as first dose of MMR vaccine according to the local 
schedule applicable in the participating countries. 
Assessment report

Solicited adverse events: During the 7-day post-vaccination period, overall/dose incidence of at least 
one solicited symptom was 73.3% in the HPV_2D group and 60.7% in the control (MMR_DTPa) group. 
- 
The overall incidence of solicited local symptoms was 63.7% in HPV_2D group and 40.0% in 
MMR_DTPa group. The most frequently reported local solicited symptom was pain at injection 
site, with an incidence of 60.3% of HPV doses in 73.0% of subjects, 20.3% after MMR 
vaccination and 50.7% after DTPa vaccination. Grade 3 solicited local symptoms after HPV-
16/18 vaccination included injection site pain (2.7% of HPV doses in 5.4% of subjects), 
swelling (2.7% of HPV doses in 5.4% of subjects) and redness (0.7% of HPV doses in 1.4% of 
subjects). Grade 3 solicited local symptoms after DTPa vaccination included injection site 
swelling (9.9%), redness (5.6%) and pain (1.4%). No Grade 3 solicited local symptoms 
reported after MMR vaccination. 
- 
The overall incidence of solicited general symptoms was 47.3% in HPV_2D group and 46.2% in 
MMR_DTPa group. The most frequent solicited general symptom after HPV-16/18 vaccination 
was irritability/fussiness (21.2% of HPV doses in 29.7% of subjects). The most frequently 
reported solicited general symptom was headache (25.7%) after MMR vaccination and 
irritability/fussiness (23.9%) after DTPa vaccination. Grade 3 solicited general symptoms 
reported after HPV-16/18 vaccination included drowsiness (2.1% of HPV doses in 4.1% of 
subjects), fever (0.7% of HPV doses in 1.4% of subjects), irritability/fussiness (0.7% of HPV 
doses in 1.4% of subjects) and loss of appetite (0.7% of HPV doses in 1.4% of subjects). 
Grade 3 solicited general symptoms reported after DTPa vaccination included loss of appetite 
(1.4%). No Grade 3 solicited general symptoms reported after MMR vaccination. 
Unsolicited adverse events: Overall 64.9% of subjects in the HPV_2D group reported at least one 
unsolicited AE. In the control (MMR_DTPa) group, 54.1% of subjects reported at least one unsolicited 
AE after the MMR vaccination and 18.3% of girls reported at least one unsolicited AE after the DTPa 
vaccination. In both groups, the most frequently reported unsolicited AE was nasopharyngitis (in 
32.4% vs. 36.5% of girls in the HPV_2D and the control (MMR_DTPa) group, respectively). 
Serious adverse events (SAEs): A total of 3 SAEs were reported by 2 subjects (in the MMR_DTPa 
group) till Month 7, and 4 SAEs were reported by 3 subjects till Month 12 (3 SAEs were reported by 2 
subjects in the MMR_DTPa group and one SAE was reported by one subject in the HPV_2D group). The 
SAEs were not considered to be causally related to vaccination. No fatal SAE was reported.

Withdrawal due to adverse events (AEs)/serious adverse events (SAEs): None of the subjects were 
withdrawn due to AEs/SAEs.  Medically significant conditions (MSCs): MSCs were reported by 38 
(51.4%) subjects in the HPV_2D group and 29 (39.2%) subjects in the MMR_DTPa group till Month 12.   
Potential Immune-Mediated Diseases (pIMDs): None was reported till Month 12.  
Clinical laboratory evaluations: In both groups, most of the subjects with haematological and 
biochemical parameters within the normal ranges at study entry remained as such after each vaccine 
dose. 
Discussion 
Healthy female subjects between, and including, 4-6 years of age at the time of the first vaccination, 
who received four doses of DTP containing vaccine (i.e., three doses in the first year of life and a 
fourth dose in the second year of life) as well as first dose of MMR vaccine according to the local 
schedule applicable in the participating countries.  
The reactogenicity and safety profile of Cervarix administered to 4–6-year old girls was found to be 
acceptable, and there was no evidence of medically significant haematological or biochemical 
anomalies after vaccination. It should be noted that some of the general symptoms solicited in this 
study may have differed compared to other studies of Cervarix conducted in older populations due to 
the younger age of the subjects. However, overall the results can be considered consistent with the 
safety profile reported in the currently approved Cervarix PI. The nature and incidence of unsolicited 
AEs, SAEs and MSCs was comparable in the 2 study groups and reflected medical conditions common 
to this age group.  
Some limitations of the study HPV-073 are to be considered such as a lack of an immunogenicity 
control group, data were collected from Latin American children only, no assessment of vaccine 
efficacy was performed in this population, the sample size too small to detect serious or clinically 
relevant AEs and thus cannot address long-term risk. 
In conclusion, Cervarix was well tolerated in 4–6-year old girls and no safety concerns were identified 
during the HPV-073 study. Meanwhile, the Company proposes to update section 4.2 of the PI to 
indicate that limited data are available using Cervarix in 4–6-year old children which is endorsed. 
8.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application. The proposed RMP changes were the 
following: 
• 
The RMP has been updated to reflect the availability of the final results of the HPV-019 and HPV-
073 studies 
• 
The results of the re-analysis of meta-analysis EPI-HPV-069 following the complementary analysis 
performed by ANSM to estimate the absolute and relative risks of thyroiditis (autoimmune or not) 
in young girls exposed to a HPV vaccine compared to those not exposed have been included. 
•  Use of HPV-16/18 vaccine in HIV-infected subjects or subjects with known immune deficiencies has 
been removed as missing information 
• 
Impact of HPV-16/18 vaccine in pregnant women who are inadvertently exposed to the vaccine 
has been removed as missing information 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/PRAC/20445/2020

•  Submission date for final results of supported study EPI-HPV-048 has been updated from Q2 2020 
to Q3 2020 
•  Module SII - Non-clinical part of the safety specification has been revised 
8.1.  Safety Specification  
Non-clinical part of the Safety Specifications 
Key safety findings from non-clinical studies have been revised: overall, the non-clinical safety results 
indicated that Cervarix was well tolerated without key safety findings.  
Clinical trial exposure 
Clinical trial exposure data have been updated. In total, 56,755 subjects were recruited in completed 
clinical trials (formally 55,968) and 1,791 subjects were recruited in on-going clinical trials (formally 
946).  
Populations not studied in clinical trials 
The number of HIV infected women recruited has been corrected and is now estimated at 233 women 
from 15 to 25 years (formally 210 women). 
Post-authorisation experience 
Post-authorization exposure data and data lock point have been updated. A total of 83,127,716 doses 
were sold. 
Additional EU requirements for the safety specification 
Specific paediatric issues 
Section on paediatric safety issues that are of particular concern in the paediatric  population has been 
updated to reflect the availability of final data of the HPV-073 study (4-6-year old girls): 
“Clinical evaluation of HPV vaccination with a 2-dose schedule in preschool girls (4-6 years old) 
was conducted in Latin American countries (Study HPV-073). The rationale for the two-dose 
schedule came from data in clinical studies indicating that two doses of Cervarix administered 
in pre-teen/adolescent girls was non-inferior to the 3-dose standard schedule in females 15-25 
years of age.”  
Identified and potential risks  
Details on important potential risks (RMP Part II, SVII 3.1) 
The description of the potential mechanisms of the theoretical risk of acquiring autoimmune disease 
following vaccination has been revised. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/PRAC/20445/2020  
Page 30/43 
 
 
 
 
The results of the re-analysis of meta-analysis EPI-HPV-069 following the complementary analysis 
performed by ANSM to estimate the absolute and relative risks of thyroiditis (autoimmune or not) in 
young girls exposed to a HPV vaccine compared to those not exposed have been included. The section 
has been revised. The conclusion of the company is that:  
“Having reviewed the totality of available data, the company does not believe that a 
modification of the Reference Safety Information (RSI) with respect to above AEs for 
Cervarix is warranted at this point in time. Autoimmune thyroiditis will remain as a potential 
risk in the RMP as part of the theoretical risk of acquiring vaccine-induced autoimmune 
diseases. A Targeted Follow-Up Questionnaire will be implemented for autoimmune thyroiditis 
to allow for enhanced monitoring of this event to help obtain from the reporters supplementary 
detailed information significant for the scientific evaluation of the reported cases and its 
diagnostic certainty. GBS and IBD, as well as all other potential immune-mediated diseases will 
continue to be monitored through routine pharmacovigilance.”  
Missing information  
1.  Missing information 1 on the use of HPV-16/18 vaccine in HIV-infected subjects or 
subjects with known immune deficiencies has been removed (RMP Part II section VII.1.2, VII.2, 
VII.3.2, VIII).  
Rationale: The results of study HPV-019 became available in July 2018 and showed that the safety 
profile of the HPV-16/18 vaccine administered to 15- to 25-year-old asymptomatic HIV-infected 
women is in line with the known safety profile of the HPV-16/18 vaccine.  
The results of this study confirmed the results of the HPV-020 study which evaluated the safety 
and immunogenicity of the HPV-16/18 vaccine in HIV-infected subjects and expands the findings 
up to month 24. 
No additional pharmacovigilance activities are planned.  
Routine risk minimization measures are implemented in SmPC section 4.4 
2.  Missing information 2 on the impact of H-16/18 vaccine in pregnant women who are 
inadvertently exposed to the vaccine has been removed (RMP Part II section VII.1.2, VII.2, 
VII.3.2, VIII). 
Rationale: The impact of Cervarix on pregnancy related outcomes has been evaluated in a 
pregnancy registry (EPI-HPV-067), observational cohort studies (EPI-HPV-018 and EPI-HPV-020) 
and clinical trials (HPV-039 and HPV-040). The results of these studies have been submitted in 
previous variations and indicate that there is no evidence that vaccination with HPV-16/18 vaccine 
alters the risk of abnormal pregnancy outcomes including birth defects. However, the data are not 
sufficient to recommend vaccination during pregnancy. 
No additional pharmacovigilance activities are planned to investigate this safety concern.  
The product information contains specific risk minimization measures to minimize the risk (SmPC 
section 4.6) reflecting that the available data are not sufficient to recommend vaccination during 
pregnancy.  
3. 
 Risk-benefit impact of missing information on type replacement has been updated in view 
of recent literature (RMP section VII.1.2). The following chapter has been added:  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/PRAC/20445/2020  
Page 31/43 
 
 
 
 
“Similarly, in the UK and other countries where the HPV-16/18 vaccine was used as part of universal 
mass vaccination, no evidence of type replacement was observed. Furthermore, a cross protective 
effect was observed [Donken, 2018; Kavanagh, 2017; Mesher, 2018; Woestengerg, 2018]”

Missing information in breakthrough are proposed for deletion.  
The following issue should be addressed:  
“Theoretical risk of acquiring vaccine-induced auto-immune disease after vaccination” should 
not be a safety concern. The pharmacovigilance plan does not include or plan any additional 
pharmacovigilance activity to address this concern. Follow-up questionnaire for investigating 
reported thyroiditis is part of routine pharmacovigilance. No routine or additional risk 
minimisation measure is proposed. In consequence, and in accordance with the GVP guideline 
module V (rev 2), this concern is proposed for removal from the safety specification. However, 
auto-immune diseases occurring after HPV 16/18 vaccination should continue to be discussed 
through the PSURs.  
   Other concerns listed above are appropriate. 
8.3.  Pharmacovigilance plan

Overall conclusions on the PhV Plan  
The proposed post-authorisation PhV development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the 
risks of the product. However, the PRAC Rapporteur has two remarks for discussion:  
1.  No additional activities are proposed for “Theoretical risk of acquiring vaccine-induced auto-
immune disease after vaccination” which is proposed for removal. 
2.  In Table Part III.3.1, the company plans to submit the reports of post-marketing surveillance 
activity addressing missing information on “Impact and effectiveness against anal lesions and 
cancer” (a category 3 study) with the next cyclical PBRER. An adequate procedure should be used 
as PBRER is not appropriate for primary evaluation of study results. The RMP should be updated 
accordingly.

Routine risk minimisation measures 
Use of HPV-16/18 vaccine in HIV-infected subjects or subjects with known immune deficiencies and

Overall conclusions on risk minimisation measures 
The proposed risk minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the 
proposed indication(s). 
In the RMP Part V.3, Summary of risk minimisation measures, table 10 reports no additional 
pharmacovigilance activities of ‘HPV type replacement” and “Impact and effectiveness against anal 
lesions and cancer”. This table should be in line with additional pharmacovigilance activities presented 
in tables 7 and 8. 
8.5.  Elements for a public summary of the RMP 
The following sections were updated:  
Part VI, section VI.1.3: Use of HPV-16/18 vaccine in HIV-infected subjects or subjects with known 
immune deficiencies and impact of HPV-16/18 vaccine in pregnant women who are inadvertently 
exposed to the vaccine has been removed from list of important risks and missing information and 
summary of important risks 
Part VI, section II.C.2 : Information on study HPV-019 has been removed from post-authorisation 
development plan 
Overall conclusions on the public summary of the RMP 
The elements for a public summary of the RMP require revision following the conclusion of the 
procedure: 
“Theoretical risk of acquiring vaccine-induced auto-immune disease after vaccination” should 
be removed from the safety specifications.

9.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC are being updated by the MAH  
SECTION 4.2 
SECTION 4.4 
SECTION 5.1 
This section was updated following RSI. 
Two clinical studies assessed safety and immunogenicity of Cervarix: 
1.  In study HPV-020, conducted in South Africa, 22 HIV uninfected and 42 HIV infected subjects 
(WHO clinical stage 1; ATP cohort for immunogenicity) received Cervarix. 
2.  Study HPV-019, a comparative study of Cervarix and quadrivalent HPV vaccine was conducted 
in 289 (ATP cohort = 157) HIV uninfected and 257 (ATP cohort = 166) HIV infected female 
subjects aged 15-25 years in Brazil, Estonia, India and Thailand.  
At study entry, HIV infected subjects in both studies had to: be asymptomatic regardless of their prior 
clinical stage; have undetectable viral load (i.e., viral load < 400 copies/mm3) for at least six months if 
on antiretroviral therapy (ART) (HPV-020) or highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) for at least 
one year (HPV-019); not be diagnosed with active tuberculosis (TB) or on TB therapy;  in HPV-019 
only - have a CD4 cell count > 350 cells/mm3.  
In both studies, seroconversion at month 7 in HIV infected subjects receiving Cervarix was 100% for 
both antigens in the ATP cohort. In HPV-019, seropositivity at month 24 after Cervarix vaccination was 
100% for HPV-16 antibodies and >96% for HPV-18 antibodies with a Geometric Mean Concentration 
(GMC) level more than 12 times higher than the response to natural HPV infection.  
In both studies, the antibody GMCs in HIV infected subjects appeared lower than in the HIV negative 
Subjects  (non-overlapping  95%  confidence  interval).  In  HPV-019,  superiority  of  immune  responses 
(neutralizing  antibodies  GMT  ratios)  to  both  HPV-16  and  HPV-18  antigens  was  demonstrated  with

Cervarix  compared  to  quadrivalent  HPV  vaccine,  at  month  7  in  HIV  infected  subjects.  The  clinical 
relevance of thisese observations is are unknown. No clinical efficacy data exist about protection against 
persistent infection or precancerous lesions among HIV infected women. 
The observed reactogenicity and safety profile of Cervarix in HIV infected women was in line with the 
known safety profile in healthy subjects (see section 4.8). 
10.  Request for supplementary information 
10.1.  Other concerns 
Clinical aspects 
1.  The proposed wording by the MAH for the section 4.2 are acceptable provided the following 
changes are made :  Cervarix is not recommended for use in children below 9 years of age due 
to lack of data on efficacy and limited data on safety and immunogenicity in this age-group. 
2.  The clinical relevance of the immunogenicity data observed in HPV-019 is unknown and no 
clinical efficacy data exist about protection against persistent infection or precancerous lesions 
among HIV infected women.  
The paragraph that is proposed to mention the superiority in immunogenicity data when 
comparison between Cervarix and Gardasil is not justified as the clinical relevance of this 
observation is unknown. 
Also this special HIV+ population enrolled was limited by an important list of exclusion criteria 
which needs to be relayed in the SmPC section 5.1 as this vulnerable population was limited to 
subjects that were asymptomatic stable under HAART and with no comorbidities. 
The proposed wording by the MAH for the section 5.1 are acceptable provided the following 
changes are made : 
Immunogenicity in HIV infected women 
Two clinical studies assessed safety and immunogenicity of Cervarix: 
1. In study HPV-020, conducted in South Africa, 22 HIV uninfected and 42 HIV infected 
subjects (WHO clinical stage 1; ATP cohort for immunogenicity) received Cervarix. 
2. Study HPV-019, a comparative study of Cervarix and quadrivalent HPV vaccine was 
conducted in 289 (ATP cohort = 157) HIV uninfected and 257 (ATP cohort = 166) HIV infected 
female subjects aged 15-25 years in Brazil, Estonia, India and Thailand. 
Subjects had to be asymptomatic regardless of their prior clinical stage. If they were currently 
taking antiretrovirals (ARVs), subjects were to be on Highly Active AntiRetroviral Therapy 
(HAART) for at least one year, have undetectable viral load (i.e., viral load < 400 copies/mm3) 
for at least six months, and have a CD4 cell count > 350 cells/mm3 at study entry. HIV+ 
subjects diagnosed with active tuberculosis (TB), or subjects on TB therapy were not enrolled. 
In both studies, seroconversion at month 7 in HIV infected subjects receiving Cervarix was 
100% for both antigens in the ATP cohort. In HPV-019, seropositivity at month 24 after 
Cervarix vaccination was 100% for HPV-16 antibodies and >96% for HPV-18 antibodies with a 
Geometric Mean Concentration (GMC) level more than 12 times higher than the response to 
natural HPV infection. In both studies, the antibody GMCs in HIV infected subjects appeared 
lower than in the HIV negative Subjects (non-overlapping 95% confidence interval). The 
clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. No clinical efficacy data exist about protection 
against persistent infection or precancerous lesions among HIV infected women.

In HPV-019, superiority of immune responses (neutralizing antibodies) to both HPV-16 (GMT 
ratio = 2.74 [95% CI 1.83; 4.11]) and HPV-18 (GMT ratio = 7.44 [95% CI 4.79; 11.54]) 
antigens was demonstrated with Cervarix compared to quadrivalent HPV vaccine, at month 7 in 
HIV infected subjects. 
The observed reactogenicity and safety profile of Cervarix in HIV infected women was in line 
with the known safety profile in healthy subjects (see section 4.8). 
RMP aspects 
3.  “Theoretical risk of acquiring vaccine-induced auto-immune disease after vaccination” should 
not be a safety concern. The pharmacovigilance plan does not include or plan any additional 
pharmacovigilance activity to address this concern. Follow-up questionnaire for investigating 
reported thyroiditis part of routine pharmacovigilance. No routine or additional risk 
minimisation measure is proposed. In consequence, and in accordance with the GVP guideline 
module V (rev 2), this concern is proposed for removal from the safety specification. However, 
auto-immune diseases occurring after HPV 16/18 vaccination should continue to be discussed 
through the PSURs.  
4.  In the RMP Part V.3, Summary of risk minimisation measures, table 10 reports no additional 
pharmacovigilance activities of ‘HPV type replacement” and “Impact and effectiveness against 
anal lesions and cancer”. This table should be in line with additional pharmacovigilance 
activities presented in tables 7 and 8. 
5.  In Table Part III.3.1, the company plans to submit the reports of post-marketing surveillance 
activity addressing missing information on “Impact and effectiveness against anal lesions and 
cancer” (a category 3 study) with the next cyclical PBRER. An adequate procedure should be 
used as PBRER is not appropriate for primary evaluation of study results. The RMP should be 
updated accordingly.

supplementary information 
11.1.  Other concerns 
Clinical aspects 
Question 1 -  The proposed wording by the MAH for the section 4.2 are acceptable provided 
the following changes are made : Cervarix is not recommended for use in children below 9 
years of age due to lack of data on efficacy and limited data on safety and immunogenicity in 
this age-group. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
As mentioned in the Clinical Overview Addendum submitted with the variation, there is no efficacy data 
in children below 9 years of age. 
The Company would like to emphasize that clinical efficacy data shall not be generated in this age 
group due to the same ethical and practical reasons as for the 9 to15-year old age range: cervical 
examination shouldn’t be performed prior to puberty and sexual debut.

As described in the SmPC, section 5.1, the indication in the 9-15year-old age group is based on the 
bridging of immunogenicity data with the 15-25 year-old age range in which efficacy was 
demonstrated. In the 9-15-year-old age group no efficacy data were generated and SmPC does not 
explicitly mention it. The Company is of the opinion that, for consistency within the SmPC, the section 
4.2 on paediatric populations should not refer to a lack of data on efficacy data below 9 years of age. 
Therefore, the Company proposes to remove the part of the sentence referring to the lack of data on 
efficacy, and to keep the wording as proposed in the original submission: 
Cervarix is not recommended for use in children below 9 years of age due to limited data on safety and 
immunogenicity in this age-group. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The  arguments  of  the  MAH  are  acknowledged  and deemed  acceptable.  The wording  proposed  by  the 
MAH is endorsed.

Question 2 - The clinical relevance of the immunogenicity data observed in HPV-019 is 
unknown and no clinical efficacy data exist about protection against persistent infection or 
precancerous lesions among HIV infected women.  
The paragraph that is proposed to mention the superiority in immunogenicity data when 
comparison between Cervarix and Gardasil is not justified as the clinical relevance of this 
observation is unknown. 
Also this special HIV+ population enrolled was limited by an important list of exclusion 
criteria which needs to be relayed in the SmPC section 5.1 as this vulnerable population was 
limited to subjects that were asymptomatic stable under HAART and with no comorbidities. 
The proposed wording by the MAH for the section 5.1 are acceptable provided the following 
changes are made : 
Immunogenicity in HIV infected women 
Two clinical studies assessed safety and immunogenicity of Cervarix: 
1. In study HPV-020, conducted in South Africa, 22 HIV uninfected and 42 HIV infected 
subjects (WHO clinical stage 1; ATP cohort for immunogenicity) received Cervarix. 
2. Study HPV-019, a comparative study of Cervarix and quadrivalent HPV vaccine was 
conducted in 289 (ATP cohort = 157) HIV uninfected and 257 (ATP cohort = 166) HIV 
infected female subjects aged 15-25 years in Brazil, Estonia, India and Thailand. 
Subjects had to be asymptomatic regardless of their prior clinical stage. If they were 
currently taking antiretrovirals (ARVs), subjects were to be on Highly Active AntiRetroviral 
Therapy (HAART) for at least one year, have undetectable viral load (i.e., viral load < 400 
copies/mm3) for at least six months, and have a CD4 cell count > 350 cells/mm3 at study 
entry. HIV+ subjects diagnosed with active tuberculosis (TB), or subjects on TB therapy 
were not enrolled.

In both studies, seroconversion at month 7 in HIV infected subjects receiving Cervarix was 
100% for both antigens in the ATP cohort. In HPV-019, seropositivity at month 24 after 
Cervarix vaccination was 100% for HPV-16 antibodies and >96% for HPV-18 antibodies 
with a Geometric Mean Concentration (GMC) level more than 12 times higher than the 
response to natural HPV infection. In both studies, the antibody GMCs in HIV infected 
subjects appeared lower than in the HIV negative Subjects (non-overlapping 95% 
confidence interval). The clinical relevance of this observation is unknown. No clinical 
efficacy data exist about protection against persistent infection or precancerous lesions 
among HIV infected women. 
In HPV-019, superiority of immune responses (neutralizing antibodies) to both HPV-16 
(GMT ratio = 2.74 [95% CI 1.83; 4.11]) and HPV-18 (GMT ratio = 7.44 [95% CI 4.79; 
11.54]) antigens was demonstrated with Cervarix compared to quadrivalent HPV vaccine, at 
month 7 in HIV infected subjects. 
The observed reactogenicity and safety profile of Cervarix in HIV infected women was in line 
with the known safety profile in healthy subjects (see section 4.8). 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The Company agrees with the addition of a paragraph on the inclusion criteria of the study, however 
since the proposal provided in the RSI only relates to the HPV-019 study, the Company proposes 
modifications to reflect the inclusion criteria of each study i.e. HPV-019 and HPV-020. See the 
proposed SmPC included in Module 1. 
Concerning superiority, the Company believes that the data generated in the study HPV-019 support 
the inclusion of the information on the superiority of immune response demonstrated with Cervarix 
compared to Gardasil and that this is relevant information for the prescribers, for reasons explained 
below. 
The HPV-019 study was designed with statistical power to show non-inferiority and superiority of 
immune response to Cervarix compared to Gardasil in HIV-infected subjects. In parallel, healthy 
females also received Gardasil or Cervarix. Lower immune response to vaccines in HIV infected 
population versus healthy subjects is expected. 
This study has first demonstrated the non-inferiority of the immune response to Cervarix compared to 
Gardasil in HIV infected subjects. As a sequential primary objective, the study also demonstrated the 
superiority of the immune response to Cervarix compared to Gardasil in HIV infected females, that is 
proposed in the current label update. 
Although a correlate of protection following HPV vaccination has not been established, it is well known 
that the mechanism of action for HPV vaccine and vaccine-induced protection is based on the immune 
response involving both humoral and cell mediated immunity. 
Nearly all HIV infected subjects seroconverted after vaccination with either vaccine.  
However, in terms of persistence of antibodies, at Month 24, seropositivity rate for HPV18 had dropped 
to 68·4% for Gardasil vaccinees, while Cervarix group maintained a high seroconversion rate (96·3%). 
Antibody GMCs in the Cervarix group also remained above those in the Gardasil vaccinees. 
Decline in seropositivity rates for HPV18 have been observed in a previous Gardasil trial in 7 to 12-
year old HIV infected children, 4 to 5 years after vaccination [Levin, 2017]. To date, no efficacy data or 
evidence of protection offered by the immune response developed by Gardasil in HIV infected 
population have been published [Lacey, 2019; Moscicki, 2019; Wilkin, 2018] except one efficacy study 
with Gardasil in HIV infected subjects in Canada [McClymont, 2019]. This was a one-arm study 
assessing HPV infection and disease endpoints data in women aged 13-66-year-old living with HIV 
compared to historical controls. The results of this study suggested that a rate of persistent qHPV 
infection among vaccinated HIV-infected women was lower than among unvaccinated HIV-infected 
Assessment report

women (2.3 vs 6.0/100 person-years). However, four breakthrough infections were observed, all with 
HPV18, that was unexpected considering the low HPV18 prevalence in that study. The authors 
concluded that vaccinated HIV-infected women may be at a higher risk for vaccine failure compared to 
vaccinated women without HIV [McClymont, 2019]. 
Despite the absence of an immune correlate of protection, the differences in immune responses elicited 
by the vaccines, especially for HPV-18, may relate to the duration of protection rendered by the 
vaccines. Moreover, in this immunocompromised population an immune response to HPV vaccination 
may be impaired due to underlying disease and that may further compromise vaccine efficacy and 
protection. Therefore, we believe that immunogenicity levels significantly higher than the ones shown 
for another approved vaccine is relevant to the prescriber. 
The AS04 adjuvant system in Cervarix (3-O-desacyl-4’-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and aluminium 
hydroxide) is likely to play a key role in the high humoral and cellular responses to the vaccine 
[Giannini, 2006]. MPL mimics a toll-like receptor 4 (TLR) agonist and serves as a potent immune-
stimulant providing higher antibody responses compared to Gardasil, as seen in healthy and HIV 
infected women. 
Furthermore, as described in the clinical overview submitted with the variation, an exploratory analysis 
in the study demonstrated that the antibody levels achieved in HIV infected subjects vaccinated with 
Cervarix were comparable and non-inferior to those achieved in HIV uninfected subjects vaccinated 
with Gardasil, a population in which Gardasil has demonstrated high efficacy. Based on the 
immunobridging principle, antibody concentration obtained with Cervarix in HIV infected women that 
are similar to those reported with Gardasil HIV uninfected (as in the efficacy trials) is reassuring. 
Based on this rationale, the Company believes that the information on the superiority of immune 
response of Cervarix versus Gardasil in HIV infected subjects is relevant to the prescriber and should 
be included in the product information. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The proposed modifications to reflect the inclusion criteria of each study i.e. HPV-019 and HPV-020 are 
endorsed.  
The Rapporteur acknowledged the arguments regarding the superiority of the immune responses induced 
by Cervarix versus Gardasil in HIV infected subjects that were presented by the MAH. Additionally, the 
section  5.1,  subheading  Bridging  of  clinical  efficacy  against  anal  lesions  and  cancers  also  includes  a 
statement on the superiority of the immunogenicity of Cervarix over Gardasil (for which efficacy against 
anal premalignant lesions has shown protection). 
The Rapporteur therefore agrees with the MAH to include the information on the superiority of immune 
response of Cervarix versus Gardasil in HIV infected subjects. 
However to be consistent with the presentation of the immunogenicity results throughout the SmPC, the 
Rapporteur recommends not to include the values of the GMT ratios. It is proposed to modify the text 
as followed:  In HPV-019, superiority of immune responses (neutralizing antibodies GMT ratios) to both 
HPV-16 (GMT ratio = 2.74 [95% CI 1.83; 4.11]) and HPV-18 (GMT ratio = 7.44 [95% CI 4.79; 11.54]) 
antigens  was  demonstrated  with  Cervarix  compared  to  quadrivalent  HPV  vaccine,  at  month  7  in  HIV 
infected subjects. 
It  is  also  recommended  to  have  this  paragraph  appear  earlier  in  the  text,  i.e.  ‘In  both  studies, 
seroconversion at month 7 in HIV infected subjects receiving Cervarix was 100% for both antigens in 
the ATP cohort. In HPV-019, seropositivity at month 24 after Cervarix vaccination was 100% for HPV-16 
antibodies  and  >96%  for HPV-18  antibodies  with  a Geometric  Mean  Concentration  (GMC)  level  more 
than 12 times higher than the response to natural HPV infection. In both studies, the antibody GMCs in 
HIV  infected  subjects  appeared  lower  than  in  the  HIV  negative  Subjects  (non-overlapping  95% 
confidence interval). In HPV-019, superiority of immune responses (neutralizing antibodies GMT ratios) 
to both HPV-16 (GMT ratio = 2.74 [95% CI 1.83; 4.11]) and HPV-18 (GMT ratio = 7.44 [95% CI 4.79; 
11.54]) antigens was demonstrated with Cervarix compared to quadrivalent HPV vaccine, at month 7 in 
HIV infected subjects. The clinical relevance of thisese observations is are unknown. No clinical efficacy

Question  3  -  “Theoretical  risk  of  acquiring  vaccine-induced  auto-immune  disease  after 
vaccination” should not be a safety concern. The pharmacovigilance plan does not include or

Question 5 - In Table Part III.3.1, the company plans to submit the reports of post-marketing 
surveillance  activity  addressing  missing  information  on  “Impact  and  effectiveness  against 
anal  lesions  and  cancer”  (a  category  3  study)  with  the  next  cyclical  PBRER.  An  adequate 
procedure should be used as PBRER is not appropriate for primary evaluation of study results. 
The RMP should be updated accordingly. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
During the third round of supplementary information on the variation to extend the Cervarix indication 
with males and anal cancer (procedure EMEA/H/C/000721/II/0067), the Company committed to perform 
the following pharmacovigilance activities to address the impact and effectiveness of Cervarix against 
anal lesions and cancer: 
- 
- 
to perform a trend analysis of anal and other HPV-related cancer every 5 years, and 
to perform a feasibility assessment to perform a case control study to assess the effectiveness 
and/or impact of HPV vaccination programmes using Cervarix every 5 years. 
The proposal was to submit the results of the trend analysis and the feasibility assessment with the next 
cyclical PBRER. The plan was included in the EU-RMP version 17, and was endorsed by the CHMP and 
the  PRAC,  as  mentioned  in  the  CHMP  extension  of  indication  variation  assessment  report 
(EMA/CHMP/668339/2015). 
The trend analysis, which will be based on the monitoring of annual reporting of anal cancer and other 
HPV-related  cancers  by  consulting  5  national  cancer  registries,  will  be  performed  in  2021.  A  critical 
analysis of the information obtained through the monitoring of the national cancer registries as well as 
an analysis of the benefits of the vaccine in the approved indication for males and anal cancer will be 
performed. The Company believes that the discussion of the results of such monitoring activities falls 
under the scope of the PBRER and therefore proposes to not update the RMP and to submit the report 
of the trend analysis with the next cyclical PBRER as previously agreed by CHMP and PRAC The same 
strategy  will  be  used  for  submission  of  the  feasibility  assessment  to  perform  a  case  control  study  to 
assess the effectiveness and/or impact of HPV vaccination programmes using Cervarix. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
It  is  acknowledged  that  the  submission  of  the  post-marketing  surveillance  in  PBRER  was  previously 
agreed by CHMP and PRAC. However, the Assessor wants to point out that the PSUR cycle is currently 
under discussion in PSUSA procedure EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00009175/201911 and has been proposed to 
be updated to 3 years by the PRAC Rapporteur. In conclusion, the post-marketing surveillance can 
be  discussed  in  the  next  cyclical  PBRER  following  the  first  analysis  in  2021,  providing  that 
this will not lead to a delay in the provision of the data. Otherwise, the MAH is asked to provide 
the data via another adequate procedure.

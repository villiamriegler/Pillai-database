2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Melanoma is the most aggressive form of skin cancer. Melanoma is the sixth and seventh most 
common malignancy in men and women, respectively.1 The median age at diagnosis is 59 years. The 
incidence of melanoma varies between different European countries but the estimated incidence was 
about 39.6 cases /100.000 men and 42.5 cases /100.000 women in 2012. In Europe in 2012, the 
mortality rate was approximately 8.8 cases/100.000 in males and 6.9 cases/100.000 in females.1 The 
outcome of melanoma depends on the stage at presentation2. Approximately 85% of patients with 
melanoma present with localised disease, 10% with regional disease and 5% with distant metastatic 
disease. The 5-year survival rates in patients who present with localised disease and primary tumours 
1.0mm or less in thickness are very good, with more than 90% of patients surviving. The 5-year 
survival rates decrease as the tumour spreads: for tumours of more than 1.0mm in thickness, survival 
rates range from 50% to 90%, with  regional node involvement survival rates are around 50%, for 
within stage III (regional metastatic melanoma) 5-year survival rates range between 20-70%, 
depending on primary nodal involvement. The long term survival for distant metastatic melanoma, the 
5-year survival is less than 10%. 
Current treatments for metastatic melanoma include systemic therapy, surgery and radiotherapy. 
Spontaneous regression of melanoma has been reported with an incidence of less than 1%. Complete 
resection of isolated metastases to one anatomic site (lung, gastrointestinal tract, bone or brain) may 
occasionally achieve long term survival. Systemic treatment may consist of chemotherapy, and/or 
immunotherapy. Palliative radiotherapy is indicated for symptomatic relief of metastases to brain, 
bones and viscera. 
Chemotherapy with dacarbazine (DTIC) may achieve objective response rates of about 20%, of which 
less than 5% is complete remission. Higher response rates have been seen using combination 
chemotherapy, however no increase in over-all survival has been demonstrated with combination 
regimens when compared to dacarbazine alone. Immunotherapeutic agents used for metastatic 
melanoma are interferon-alfa (IFNα) and interleukine-2 (IL-2). Recurrent melanoma is resistant to 
most standard systemic therapy and no standardized effective second line treatment is established.

In EU Countries, dacarbazine was used for many years as standard first line treatment of patients with 
metastatic melanoma3. Clinical trials with dacarbazine have shown low response rates ranging from 
11% -25%, low rate of complete responses and of short duration (3 to 6 months). The median survival 
time ranged from 4.5 to 6 months4,5,6. Ipilimumab (Yervoy), a human monoclonal antibody against 
CTLA-4, was approved in the EU in 2011 for melanoma patients who have received prior therapy. The 
approval of ipilimumab was based on the results of a phase III study performed in previously treated 
melanoma patients was associated with a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) 
compared with the gp100 vaccine (10.1 versus 6.4 months; HR: 0.66; p= 0.003). In recent times, the 
serine-threonine kinase BRAF was discovered mutated in many cancers7. BRAF mutations have been 
found in approximately 50% of melanoma, 30-70% of thyroid carcinomas, 30% of ovarian carcinoma 
and 10% of colorectal carcinoma. Oncogenic mutations in BRAF result in constitutive activation of the 
RAF-MEK-ERK pathway which in turn stimulates cell growth, proliferation and cell survival in the 
absence of typical growth factors8. For patients with tumours harbouring the BRAFV600 mutation, 
kinase inhibitors vemurafenib (Zelborarf) and dabrafenib (Tafinlar) were approved in the EU in 2012 
and 2013, respectively, and target directly the mutated protein BRAFV600. Vemurafenib (Zelboraf), as 
first line treatment was approved based on the results of the pivotal phase III study (BRIM3) and was 
associated with a median progression-free survival (PFS) 6.9 vs 1.6 months, respectively (HR 0.38, 
95%CI: 0.32-0.46, p<0.0001) and  median OS 13.6 vs 9.7 months (HR: 0.70, 95%CI: 0.57-0.87, 
p<0.0001) compared with DTIC. Dabrafenib (Tafinlar), as first line therapy was approved based on the 
results of the pivotal trial BREAK-3 that showed a median PFS of 6.9 vs 2.7 months for the dabrafenib 
and DTIC group respectively, (HR: 0.37; 95% CI: 0.24, 0.58; p-value<0.0001) and OS (HR 0.76, 
95%CI: 0.48, 1.21); a 12 month OS rate of 70 % and 63 % for dabrafenib and DTIC treatments, 
respectively). Trametinib (Mekinist) was approved in 2014 to target the mitogen-activated extracellular 
signal regulated kinase 1 (MEK 1 and MEK 2) proteins to dampen the signalling pathway that promotes 
proliferation and survival in BRAFV600 mutated melanoma. Mekinist as first line of treatment was 
approved based on the results of a phase III study that showed a median PFS 4.8 vs 1.5 months, 
respectively (HR 0.45; 95%CI:0.33, 0.63; p-value <0.0001) and median OS of 15.6 vs 11.3 months 
(HR 0.78; 95%CI 0.57, 1.06) for trametinib and dacarbazine respectively. 
The co-inhibitory receptor programmed cell death – 1 (PD-1) is a key regulator of T cell activity that 
belongs to the same immunoglobulin superfamily which includes the co-stimulatory receptor CD28 and 
the co-inhibitory receptor CTLA-4.9, Pembrolizumab is a humanised monoclonal anti-programmed cell 
death-1 (PD-1) antibody (IgG4/kappa isotype with a stabilising sequence alteration in the Fc region) 
produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells by recombinant DNA technology. It binds to the PD-1 receptor 
and blocks its interaction with PD-1 ligand (PD-L1) and PD-1 ligand 2 (PD-L2). The PD-1 receptor is a 
negative regulator of T cell activity that has been shown to be involved in the control of T cell immune 
responses. Engagement of PD-1 with the ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are expressed in antigen 
presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the tumour microenvironment, 
results in inhibition of T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion. Pembrolizumab potentiates T cell 
responses, including anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-L2 
ligands.

The applicant applied for the following indication: 
“KEYTRUDA is indicated for the treatment of unresectable or metastatic melanoma in adults.” 
The final approved indication was: 
“KEYTRUDA as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) 
melanoma in adults.” 
The recommended dose of KEYTRUDA is 2 mg/kg administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 
weeks. Patients  should be treated with KEYTRUDA until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Atypical responses (i.e., an initial transient increase in tumour size or small new lesions within the first 
few months followed by tumour shrinkage) have been observed. It is recommended to continue 
treatment for clinically stable patients with initial evidence of disease progression  until disease 
progression is confirmed.  
Guidelines for withholding or discontinuation of KEYTRUDA are described in Table 1 of the SmPC. 
KEYTRUDA should be permanently discontinued: 
•  For Grade 4 toxicity except for endocrinopathies that are controlled with replacement hormones 
•  If corticosteroid dosing cannot be reduced to ≤10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day within 12 
weeks 
•  If a treatment-related toxicity does not resolve to Grade 0-1 within 12 weeks after last dose of 
KEYTRUDA 
•  If any event occurs a second time at Grade ≥ 3 severity 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The active substance of Keytruda (50 mg powder for concentrate for solution for IV infusion) is 
pembrolizumab (MK-3475), which is a humanised monoclonal antibody that binds to human PD-1 and 
blocks the interaction between PD-1 receptor and its ligands. MK-3475 is an IgG4 monoclonal antibody 
with Class-II mechanism of action (binding to cell-bound antigen not involving Fc effector function).  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
It is an IgG4/kappa isotype with a stabilizing SER228PRO sequence alteration in the Fc region; it could 
be demonstrated that the S228P mutation introduced into MK-3475 in the IgG4 hinge region prevents 
the formation of half molecules. Induction of half molecules, if not in that way engineered, is typical for 
IgG4 antibodies. The molecular characteristics were determined by a combination of techniques 
including mass spectrometry, peptide mapping, and N-glycan profiling. 
The antibody is heterogeneously glycosylated at Asn297 within the Fc domain of each heavy chain, 
yielding a molecular weight of approximately 149 kDa for intact MK-3475. The dominant glycoform is 
the fucosylated agalacto diantennary glycan form (G0F). 
The observed molecular weight of the most abundant form of the intact antibody is 148.9 kDa, while 
the most abundant forms of the heavy and light chains are 50.7 kDa and 23.7 kDa, respectively. 
Manufacturing process  
MK-3475 is a humanised monoclonal antibody that is expressed as a secreted product from a 
suspension Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell line. A fully characterised Master Cell Bank (MCB) as 
well as a Working Cell Bank (WCB) was established. Cells from the WCB are expanded in shake flasks, 
disposable rocker bags, and a seed bioreactor to generate the inoculum for a production bioreactor to 
produce the antibody product. The downstream processing includes three chromatography steps, two 
Page 11/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
orthogonal viral clearance steps, ultrafiltration/diafiltration, and a final 0.2 µm filtration step. All raw 
materials used in upstream/downstream manufacturing processes are animal component free. 
Upstream and downstream processing is considered as state of the art for production of monoclonal 
antibodies. 
Definitions of key terms were provided by the Applicant as follows: 
•  Critical Quality Attribute (CQA): A critical quality attribute (CQA) is a physical, chemical, biological 
or microbiological property or characteristic that should be within an appropriate limit, range, or 
distribution to ensure the desired product quality (ICH Q8). 
•  Critical Process Parameter (CPP): A process parameter whose variability has an impact on critical 
quality attribute and therefore should be monitored or controlled to ensure the process produces 
the desired quality (ICH Q8). 
•  Key Process Attribute (KPA): Process and/or product attributes that are primary measure(s) of the 
consistency of performance for each step. 
•  Key Operating Parameter (KOP): Parameter whose variability has an impact on a KPA and therefore 
should be monitored or controlled to ensure the desired consistency of performance. 
Process development 
There have been no major process changes other than scale and site changes between non-clinical and 
clinical manufacturing: non-clinical manufacturing was performed at the pilot plant facility using the 
MSB. Initial clinical manufacturing was performed at the clinical manufacturing facility. For initial 
clinical supplies, manufacture started from the MCB. Meanwhile, a working cell bank (WCB) has been 
qualified and introduced into the process. To enable facility fit at larger scale and also to increase 
productivity and robustness of downstream steps to ensure an adequate supply of MK-3475, the active 
substance manufacturing process has been transferred from the clinical site to a commercial 
manufacturing facility with greater capacity (MedImmune (FMC); Frederick Manufacturing Center, 
Frederick, MD). In addition to a change in scale of the active substance manufacture, other changes 
were made to further enhance the robustness of the commercial active substance manufacturing 
process. 
Process validation, also referred to as Process Performance Qualification (PPQ), demonstrated that 
for all four PPQ batches, the predefined acceptance criteria for the upstream CQAs (of the unprocessed 
bulk) and for the downstream CQAs (active substance) were consistently met.  
The active substance is already finally formulated. Active substance from FMC is stored at -40 ± 5°C 
and shipped at ≤ -35°C to the finished product manufacturing location.  
Site changes were supported following ICH guideline Q5E by process and analytical comparability 
studies (comparative release testing and comparative extended site by site characterisation studies) 
including comparative long term stability assessments. Sufficient comparability for active substance 
from the clinical manufacturing site and active substance from FMC was demonstrated. Minor 
differences were sufficiently characterised (and understood). These root cause investigations 
(characterisations) were considered adequate and the outcome (i.e. no effect on safety and/or efficacy 
may be expected) seems plausible. 
Characterisation 
The primary, secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of MK-3475 were evaluated using a series 
of biochemical, biophysical and functional characterisation techniques. The single characterisation 
methods are considered scientifically justified, sufficient sensitive and state of the art and therefore 
suitable for characterisation of the active substance.  
Product-related species of MK-3475 active substance were adequately separated by methods that 
exploit differences in molecular size, charge, and hydrophobicity.  
Process-related impurities were adequately determined and include CHO host cell proteins (HCP), 
CHO host cell DNA and Protein A. 
Control 
The active substance Quality Control for batch release includes identity, potency (competitive binding 
ELISA), purity and impurities and several other general tests. 
Reference Standard 
Page 12/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As defined by ICH Q6B, an in-house reference material, manufactured at WAG facility, has been 
established for MK-3475. 
Stability  
Based on the presented 18 months real time real condition long-term stability data for the three 
primary batches the claimed shelf life of 18 months at -40ºC is considered justified.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description and composition  
Finished product, powder for solution for infusion, single-use 50 mg/vial is reconstituted with sterile 
water for injection and further diluted with normal saline (0.9% sodium chloride injection) or 5% 
dextrose (5% dextrose injection; also referred to as 5% glucose) prior to IV administration.  
Formulation development and optimisation studies have shown the pH of optimum product stability to 
be pH 5.2-5.8. Further low moisture content of the finished product lyophilisate ensures product 
stability. MK-3475 finished product does not contain any overages. 
Process development 
Initially, clinical materials have been manufactured at the clinical manufacturing facility. Increasing 
demand for finished product based on promising clinical data required an increase in capacity. 
Therefore, a second site, Schering-Plough (Brinny) in Innishannon, Ireland (further referred to as 
Brinny) was added as a finished product manufacturing site to supply the clinical trials.  
Site changes were supported following ICH guideline Q5E by process and analytical comparability 
studies (comparative release testing and comparative site by site extended characterisation studies) 
including comparative long term stability assessments.  
Manufacture 
For the manufacture of MK-3475 finished product, FMC active substance is delivered as frozen final 
formulated bulk (FFB) solution containing the exact formulation of the final finished product. The 
finished product manufacturing process consists of thawing, pooling, bioburden reduction filtration, 
sterile filtration, filling, lyophilisation, capping, and visual inspection.  
The manufacturing process for finished product and its controls (in-process control (IPC) and critical 
process parameters (CPP) ranges) are adequately presented. The defined critical process parameters 
are justified. The proven acceptable ranges and the defined normal operating ranges are considered 
acceptable for the critical process parameters.  
The defined IPCs and their ranges are considered justified. Overall adequate IPCs are in place as part 
of the overall control system to ensure consistent manufacturing of the finished product. 
All PPQ study objectives and CPP, IPC, PPQ samples and CQA acceptance criteria were met. Based on 
the study results, the process is considered principally sufficient validated for commercial 
manufacturing.  
Control 
The finished product Quality Control for batch release includes identity, potency (competitive binding 
ELISA), purity and impurities and several other general tests. 
Reference standards are identical to the active substance material.  
Container closure system 
The container closure system is adequately described. It consists of Type-I glass vials, stoppered with 
bromobutyl stoppers and sealed with flip-off seals Stability leachable data as well as a careful 
characterisation and risk assessment of the observed leachables were provided to exclude any impact 
on patient’s safety. 
Stability  
Page 13/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary stability batches are not produced at the proposed commercial full scale, and have been 
justified to be representative for the commercial process.  
The updated 18 months real time real condition long-term stability data for the primary batches 
support the claimed shelf life of 18 months at 5ºC.  
Adventitious agents safety 
Compliance with the TSE Guideline (EMEA/410/01 – rev. 3) has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
The active drug substance of MK-3475 is produced in a serum-free culture medium. No animal-derived 
material is added during fermentation of MK-3475.  
Virus safety 
The fermentation process of the monoclonal antibody MK-3475 is in a serum-free medium. No animal 
derived material is added during fermentation of MK-3475. This minimises a possible contamination for 
adventitious viruses. The cells used for production of MK-3475 have been sufficiently screened for 
viruses. These tests failed to demonstrate the presence of any viral contaminant in the MCB of MK-
3475 with the exception of intracellular A-type retroviral particles which are well known to be present 
in CHO cells. However, this is acceptable since there is sufficient capacity within the manufacturing 
procedure of MK-3475 for reduction of this type of viral particles. Therefore, there are no concerns for 
the use in the production process of MK-3475. The purification process of MK-3475 includes several 
steps for inactivation/removal of enveloped viruses. The effectiveness of these steps has been 
sufficiently demonstrated.  
In summary, the adventitious agents safety of MK-3475 is considered to be sufficiently demonstrated.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Overall the quality data presented by the Applicant are detailed. However, Major Objections were 
identified during the review as well as numerous Other Concerns. It was acknowledged that 
characterisation of the active substance (and its microheterogeneity / product-related impurities) as 
well as extended characterisation in comparability studies were carried out very carefully using a large 
set of suitable and sufficient sensitive (wherever possible orthogonal) state-of-the-art analytical 
methods.  
A Major Objection was raised in relation to the use of two significantly different manufacturing routes. 
In their responses, the Applicant withdrew one site as commercial active substance manufacturing site. 
The Applicant acknowledged the relatively broad comparability acceptance criteria included in the 
original submission, when results were compared with the specification in effect at time of study 
initiation; therefore, the Applicant performed a thorough comparative assessment of product quality 
attributes.  
In the description of the manufacturing process, the Applicant was asked to clarify the intended use of 
so-called Proven Acceptable Ranges (PARs).  
It was acknowledged that several orthogonal bioassay formats were used in the characterisation of Fab 
and Fc domains of MK-3475. However with regard to the Fab-related assays, the binding ELISA, which 
was initially proposed to be the sole potency test, did not fully reflect the mechanism of action of MK-
3475. Although there may be some lack of correlation, the notion that neither the cell-based 
competitive binding assay nor the functional cell-based assay contribute to any additional information 
necessary for correct release and stability decisions is endorsed. 
The final specifications proposed by the Applicant for active substance and finished product are 
considered acceptable. 
An issue was raised in relation to the evidence that the container closure system proposed for the 
finished product may not be suitable although adequate certificates and Ph. Eur. compliance is 
presented. Evidence is based on two leachable stability studies. Additional data were provided by the 
Applicant in their responses indicating that patient exposure to these materials results in leachable 
levels which are below the doses known to cause adverse events and therefore can be considered 
toxicologically safe. The issue was considered resolved. 
Page 14/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
On the basis of additional stability data provided by the Applicant, the 18 month shelf life for the 
finished product was considered acceptable. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Overall, the quality of Keytruda is considered to be in line with the quality of other approved 
monoclonal antibodies. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
documentation comply with existing guidelines. The fermentation and purification of the active 
substance are adequately described, controlled and validated. The active substance is well 
characterised with regard to its physicochemical and biological characteristics, using state-of-the-art 
methods, and appropriate specifications are set. The manufacturing process of the finished product has 
been satisfactorily described and validated. The quality of the finished product is controlled by 
adequate test methods and specifications. 
Viral safety and the safety concerning other adventitious agents including TSE have been sufficiently 
assured. 
The overall Quality of Keytruda is considered acceptable. Several recommendations for future quality 
development were agreed by the Applicant. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommended several points for investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The binding of pembrolizumab (MK-3475, SCH 900475, ORG 307488-0) to human PD-1 was evaluated 
in different experimental test systems. In vitro studies were performed in cell lines expressing either 
PD-1 or PD-L1, in cynomolgus and human PBMCs and in vivo studies were performed mainly in mouse 
models. Given the lack of cross-reactivity of MK-3475 with murine PD-1, a commercially available 
hamster anti-murine PD-1 mAb, J43, was used as surrogate for in vivo pharmacology studies. 
The parental antibody to pembrolizumab was produced by immunizing mice with hPD-1 cDNA and 
CHO-PD-1 cells. The pembrolizumab antibody was generated by humanization of the parental murine 
anti-human PD-1 antibody.The pharmacokinetics (PK) of pembrolizumab were evaluated in a non-GLP 
single dose pharmacokinetic study and two GLP repeat dose toxicokinetic (TK) studies (1-month and 6-
month) in cynomolgus monkeys. A non-GLP study in SCID mice was also conducted to evaluate the 
Fab-arm exchange of pembrolizumab in vivo. 
Toxicology was evaluated in the relevant non-primate model cynomolgus monkey the only relevant 
and pharmacologically responsive model.

expressing the PD-1 receptor and PD-L1 expressing cells (carcinoma cells, native dendritic cells, 
macrophages, B cells, etc.) presenting the inhibitory signal. The result of IL-2 production is presented 
in Figure 4.

Assessment of Functional Activity of pembrolizumab In Vitro 
Binding of pembrolizumab to cynomolgus PD-1 
The binding affinity of pembrolizumab for cynomolgus PD-1 was evaluated by ELISA, cellular ELISA 
and by bio-light interferometry (study PD001). In these studies, the binding affinity of pembrolizumab 
to cynomolgus and human PD-1 was found to be in the same range, albeit slightly lower for 
cynomolgus PD-1. By kinetic analysis, KD was 29 pM for human PD-1 and 118 pM for cynomolgus PD-1 
(Table 4). Functionally, pembrolizumab blocked the binding of human PD-1 ligands to cells expressing 
human or cynomolgus PD-1 with a comparable potency (Table 5).

Table 5: 
Assessment of blocking the binding of PD-1 to PD-L1 and PD-L1 mediated by 
pembrolizumab  
For testing binding of pembrolizumab to PD-1 expressed in human, mouse and cynomolgus macaque, 
stable cell lines were used. The results are shown in Figure 5.

Efficacy of Anti-Mouse PD-1 Surrogate Antibody in Syngeneic Tumor Models In vivo studies 
Study PD006 report SN 09546: anti-tumor activity of anti-mouse PD-1 antibody J43, in syngeneic 
mouse tumor models. 
The following cell lines were used to set syngeneic mouse tumor models: 
- MC38- Colon adenocarcinomas of C57BL/6 origin 
- C1498- Acute myeloid leukemia of C57BL/6 origin 
- PDV6- Squamous cell carcinoma of C57BL/6 origin 
- A20- B cell lymphoma of Balb/c origin. 
Tumor cells were subcutaneously injected into the ventral surface of the lower flank of syngeneic mice. 
Treatment with antibodies was initiated when tumors reached a volume of 50-70 mm3.  
The Figure 7 shows results obtained by administrating IP J43 antibody or isotype control into mice SC 
implanted with MC38. The efficacy of anti-PD-1 was assessed in the MC38 syngeneic model of colon 
adenocarcinoma in C57BL/6 mice as monotherapy or in combination with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or 
gemcitabine. Anti-mouse PD-1 mAb J43 or hamster IgG were administered IP at 2 or 10 mg/kg every 
3-4 days for a total of 5 doses.

C57BL/6 female mice were implanted subcutaneously with 1 x 106 MC38 syngeneic colon adenocarcinomas cells. On day 6 when 
tumour volumes were approximately 50-80 mm3 , mice were injected i.p. with either control hamster Ig or hamster anti-mouse PD-
1 (J43) at 2mg/kg or 10mg/kg. Injections were repeated on day 10, 13, 16, and 20 (black arrows). Tumour volumes were measured 
every 3-4 days until day 30 and the results are presented as the means + standard errors. Survival was followed for 60 days.  
In addition to monotherapy, anti-PD1 immunotherapy was evaluated in combination with either 5 FU 
or gemcitabine. The results are shown in Figure 8.

Survival rate (%) 
Together with 5-FU, mouse anti-PD-1 inhibited tumour growth and prolonged survival; i.e. 60% of 
mice receiving concurrent treatments of 5-FU and J43 survived beyond 50 days with no evidence of 
tumour relapse.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No studies evaluating secondary pharmacodynamics of pembrolizumab have been submitted. However, 
the applicant submitted a study to evaluate the ability of anti-PD-1 antibody to spontaneously activate 
the immune system. 
Assessment of the Ability of pembrolizumab to Spontaneously Activate the Immune System 
The ability of pembrolizumab to activate the immune system (as measured by levels of IL-2) without 
concurrent T-cell receptor triggering was assessed in two in vitro assays (study PD004; SN 10121) . In 
the first assay, peripheral blood from healthy human donors was diluted, pre-incubated with 
pembrolizumab or human IgG4 isotype control antibody, and then stimulated with SEB or left 
unstimulated. In this assay, SEB represented a concurrent specific stimulus for the T-cell receptor. 
Pembrolizumab enhanced production of IL-2 only in the presence of SEB; in the absence of SEB, 
pembrolizumab had no effect on the level of IL-2.

Safety pharmacology programme 
Stand-alone studies evaluating safety pharmacology of pembrolizumab were not submitted (see non-
clinical discussion).  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No non-clinical no clinical dedicated pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions studies with 
pembrolizumab have been conducted (see non-clinical discussion). 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No tissue distribution/mass balance or metabolism studies with pembrolizumab were submitted (see 
non-clinical discussion). 
No excretion studies with pembrolizumab were submitted (see non-clinical discussion).

Non-GLP pharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab following a single IV dose administration in female 
cynomolgus monkeys (PK001 = SN 08S00372) 
Female cynomolgus monkeys (3/group) were given a single IV dose of pembrolizumab at 0, 0.3, 3 or 
30 mg/kg and followed for a period of 84 days. Concentration of serum pembrolizumab was 
determined by ELISA. An overview of the PK parameters obtained after non-compartmental analysis is 
provided in Table 6.

a) All three monkeys in each dose group were included in the analysis 
b) Because of ADA, sample concentrations that were less than 1 mg/L were excluded from the calculation. 
Therefore, AUC 0-last was different for different animals: the last time point for three monkeys in the 0.3 mg/kg 
group were 14, 7 and 14 days; for 3 mg/kg last three time points were 42, 28 and 14 days and for 30 mg/kg last 
three time points were 28, 14 and 63 days. 
There was a dose-dependent increase in exposure; the increase was more than dose-proportional 
between 0.3 and 3 mg/kg and dose-proportional between 3 and 30 mg/kg. Clearance varied from 2.5 
– 11.3 ml/kg/day and was higher for the low dose. The elimination half-life was prolonged and the 
distribution volume increased in the high-dose group. From day 10 on, a drop in serum pembrolizumab 
levels (in 8 of 9 animals) correlated with detection of ADA.  
Anti-pembrolizumab ADA (as measured by bridging ELISA) were detected in 8 out of 9 animals at 
variable time points starting as soon as day10 and most visible at day 21 after dosing. However, it 
should be noted that ADA could only be measured if the concentration of pembrolizumab was not 
interfering with the assay (< 5 µg/ml).

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The pembrolizumab toxicological program has been performed according to ICH S6 guideline for 
biotechnology products and ICH S9 nonclinical evaluation for anticancer pharmaceuticals, and 
consisted of pivotal 1-month and 6-month repeat-dose chronic toxicity studies both with 4-month 
recovery periods in Cynomolgus monkey, supported by toxicokinetic analysis. In addition, two cross-
reactivity studies in both normal human and Cynomolgus monkey tissues were submitted.

In order to evaluate whether there was an increase in lymphocytes accumulation in the spleen derived 
from the increased T cells activation from anti-PD-1 therapy, the weight of the spleens were measured 
in treated animals.  A trend of higher mean absolute and relative spleen weights in comparison to 
control was observed in males starting from the low dose (6 mg/kg), reaching a significant 60% 
increase in males administered 200 mg/kg and euthanized during Week 5 (Table 9). However, no 
remarkable macroscopic observations were reported in spleens of high dosed animals.

Genotoxicity 
The applicant did not submit studies on genotoxicity with pembrolizumab (see non-clinical discussion).  
Carcinogenicity 
The applicant did not submit studies on carcinogenicity with pembrolizumab (see non-clinical 
discussion).  
Reproduction Toxicity 
No reproductive toxicity studies were conducted with pembrolizumab (see non-clinical discussion).  
However, the applicant provided literature data on the role of PD-1 on the maintenance of immune 
tolerance during foetal development. During pregnancy, foetal antigens can be detected in the 
maternal spleen, where they cause proliferation of antigen-specific T lymphocytes in response10. The

PD-L1 molecule is expressed at the utero-placental interface, where it protects the concepti from 
maternal T-cell mediated immunity 11 . Its expression is detected at the utero-placental interface of the 
placentas of CBA x C57BL/6 mice concepti as early as 10 days post-conception while it is negligible, as 
expected for syngeneic concepti, at the utero-placental interface of the placentas of CBA x CBA mice. 
In human and non-human primate foetuses, maternal antibodies can cross the placenta via active 
transport across the chorioallantoic placenta. This transfer is mediated principally via the neonatal Fc 
receptor (FcRn) and there is general agreement that immunoglobulins of the IgG1 subclass are 
transported most efficiently. Foetal IgG levels remain low during the first two trimesters of pregnancy 
and typically rise during the third trimester so that the levels of IgG4 in the foetus are similar to those 
in the maternal circulation12 . Blockade of PD-L1 signaling has been shown in murine models of 
allogeneic pregnancy (developed by mating different strains of mice) to abrogate feto-maternal 
tolerance to the concepti and to result in an increase in fetal resorption13. The rate of spontaneous 
abortion in the allogeneic pregnancy in crossed CBA x C57BL/6 mice is 18%. Treatment with anti-PDL1 
resulted in a significant increase in the rate of abortion of those allogeneic concepti to 86%.  
The role of T cell-mediated immunity in foetal rejection was then confirmed in an experiment by the 
demonstration of infiltrations of T cells congregated at the site of foetal resorption in anti-PD-L1-
treated animals from allogeneic pregnancy using immunohistochemistry of placental sections13. 
Confirmation that T cells are required for anti-PD-L1 rejection was obtained in the following set of 
experiments. RAG-1 -/- mice (on a C57BL/6 background), which lack T and B cells, were mated with 
CBA males and treated with anti-PD-L1 mAb. All RAG-1 -/-females had normal numbers of healthy 
embryos, whereas RAG sufficient C57BL/6 females mated with CBA males and treated with anti-PD-L1 
mAb showed increased foetal resorption13. Further implication of T cells in PD-1/PD-L1-mediated fetal 
resorption was demonstrated by the allogeneic mating of B cell-deficient mice  followed by anti-PD-L1 
mAb treatment. Blocking the PD-1/PD-L1 pathway resulted in foetal rejection in 100% of these mice. 
Wafula et al.14 identified PD-1 as an important player in the protection of the foetus that appears to be 
mediated by regulatory T cells (Tregs). Regulatory T cells from normal pregnant mice transferred into 
abortion-prone mice allowed abortion-prone mice to pursue a successful pregnancy by restoring 
normal physiological protection to the concepti. Subsequent treatment of these mice with anti-PD1 
abrogated the protective effect of Tregs and resulted in the previous abortion rates. PD-L1 expressed 
on the surface of Tregs was shown to be essential to control the maternal immune response15. From 
the literature provided by the applicant, there was no evidence of malformations related to the 
blockade of PD-L1 signaling13, 14, 15.

Toxicokinetic data 
In both the ELISA and ECL assays, the concentrations of pembrolizumab in monkey serum were 
determined by ligand (hPD1-Fc) as capture followed by anti-human kappa chain antibody (Ab) as 
detection.  
Toxicokinetics of pembrolizumab following repeated dosing for 1-month study (study SN 08396) 
In this toxicity study, cynomolgus monkeys (6/sex/group) received IV doses of 0, 6, 40 or 200 mg/kg 
pembrolizumab, once weekly for a total of 5 doses. Toxicokinetics were evaluated after the first dose 
(day 1) and after the fifth dose (day 28). The results are shown in Table 10.

In the 6 mg/kg group, development of ADA during the dosing phase was observed. When taking into 
account only the ADA-negative samples for the 5th dosing interval, Cmax is 524 µg/ml and AUC(0-
7day) is 2350 µg*day/ml. The terminal half-life was determined for the animals assigned to the 
recovery period. For the 6 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg group, these parameters were derived from ADA-
negative animals only. 
Toxicokinetics of pembrolizumab in the 6-month study (study TT #11-1084) 
Cynomolgus monkeys (5/sex/group) received IV doses of 0, 6, 40 or 200 mg/kg pembrolizumab, once 
every 2 weeks for a total of 12 doses. Toxicokinetics were evaluated after the 1st dose (day 1), the 
sixth dose (day 71), and the eleventh dose (Day 141.) The T1/2 was evaluated after the last dose 
(dose 12 at day 155).  
Anti-pembrolizumab antibodies were detected in 5 animals of the 6 mg/kg group (during the dosing 
period) and in 1 animal in the 200 mg/kg group (during the recovery period) and were associated with 
an increase in elimination of pembrolizumab. Due to drug interference, the presence of ADA in mid- 
and high-dose animals cannot be excluded.

Local Tolerance  
The applicant did not submit dedicated studies on local tolerance (see discussion on non-clinical 
aspects). 
Other toxicity studies 
Immunogenicity  
Three normal female cynomolgus monkeys per group were administered a single intravenous (IV) dose 
(vehicle control, 0.3, 3.0 and 30 mg/kg) of pembrolizumab. Blood was collected at predose day -7, day 
0 and after SCH 900475 or vehicle administration at day 1, day 7, day 28, day 56 and day 84 for ex-
vivo PD analysis. 
ADA were detected in most of the treated animals: in all animals in the 0.3 mg/kg (14-day samples 
after dosing) and 3 mg/kg (21-day samples after dosing) dose groups, and in 2 out of 3 animals in the 
30 mg/kg dose group (21-day samples after dosing). No assay was performed to assess whether ADA 
were neutralizing. 
Table 13 shows the PK parameters following administration of pembrolizumab in the presence or 
absence of detectable anti-drug-antibodies (ADA). PK results showed a dose dependent increase in 
exposure. The clearance varied from 3.7 – 5.7 mL/kg/day and was higher for the low dose; the 
elimination half-life was prolonged and the distribution volume in steady state increased in the high 
dose group regardless of the ADA status.

Lack Fab arm exchange in vivo (study report TRPT-002743)

SCID mice by co-injecting either pembrolizumab or anti-PD-1 wt with anti-PCSK9 wt. The amount of 
hybrid antibodies formed in vivo was detected by a hybrid-specific ELISA. As shown in Figure 10, 
hybrid antibodies can be detected in sera of mice injected with the mixture of wildtype anti-PD-1 and 
anti-PCSK9 mAb. In contrast no hybrid antibodies were detected when pembrolizumab and anti-PCSK9 
wt mAb were co-injected.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Pembrolizumab is a protein, which is expected to biodegrade in the environment and not be a 
significant risk to the environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk 
Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), pembrolizumab is 
exempt from preparation of an Environmental Risk Assessment as the product and excipients do not 
pose a significant risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Keytruda (pembrolizumab, SCH 900475, MK-3475) is a humanized antibody where only the 
complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of the variable regions are of mouse-sequence origin.  
The pharmacology of pembrolizumab was evaluated in Cynomolgus monkey as the similarities in 
binding affinities with human PD-1 were observed in in vitro experiments compared to mouse, rat and 
dog, where no binding was observed. The antitumor activity induced by blocking PD-1 was shown in 
vivo in mice in a syngeneic tumour model where MC38 colon adenocarcinoma was injected 
subcutaneously and mice were treated using a commercially available homologous anti-mouse PD-1 
monoclonal antibody J43 at 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg doses every 3-4 weeks. J43 10 mg/kg 
administered IP, alone or in combination with 5-fluorouracil or gemcitabine, significantly inhibited the 
growth of the tumours. The proposed clinical dose for pembrolizumab is 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Given 
the availability of clinical data from humans, the lack of a non-clinical proof-of-concept at the 2 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks dose is acceptable. 
The applicant did not submit studies on distribution, metabolism and excretion. No radiolabeled tissue 
distribution/mass balance or metabolism studies with pembrolizumab were submitted and no serum 
protein binding assay was submitted. This is acceptable as in accordance with regulatory guidelines for 
biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals (ICH S6), no tissues distribution studies, metabolism studies, 
Page 29/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mass balance are considered necessary. Following a single 0.3, 3.0, 30-mg/kg IV dose of 
pembrolizumab to female cynomolgus monkeys, the Vss mean value (30.9, 36.8, 54.8 ml/kg) was 
similar to the plasma volume of monkeys suggesting that pembrolizumab has a limited distribution out 
of the plasma compartment. The elimination half-life was prolonged and the distribution volume 
increased in the high-dose group. Systemic exposure to pembrolizumab was independent of sex and 
increased with increasing dose. Exposure (AUC(0-7d)) was greater after 5 administrations than after 
the 1st administration of pembrolizumab. This indicates accumulation. pembrolizumab was eliminated 
following multiphasic kinetics. Terminal half-life (t1/2) ranged from 11.8 to 23.7 days across doses. 
From day 10 on, a drop in serum pembrolizumab levels (in 8 of 9 animals) correlated with detection of 
ADA. ADA were detected in all of the treated animals except in 1 animal dosed 30 mg/kg. At lower 
dose ADA were detected earlier in time (after 14-day) vs 21-day for higher doses. In the 6-month 
study, the systemic exposure to pembrolizumab was independent of sex and increased with increasing 
dose. The AUC(0-14d) and Cmax values were slightly greater than dose proportional from 6 to 40 
mg/kg and approximately dose-proportional from 40 – 200 mg/kg. With repeated administration, the 
systemic exposure to pembrolizumab increased. However, the systemic exposure was similar on study 
day 71 and 141 across doses, indicating that steady state had been reached. The terminal elimination 
half-life ranged from 21 to 22 days across doses. Both the ADA assay and the neutralizing antibody 
assay are currently under revalidation and the validation report is expected to be finalized in 
December, 2015. The CHMP recommends the post-approval submission of stability data of the labelled 
reagents. 
No excretion studies with pembrolizumab were submitted. This is acceptable according to the current 
ICH S6 (R1) guidance on the preclinical safety evaluation of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals. 
Stand-alone studies evaluating safety pharmacology of pembrolizumab were not submitted. This is 
acceptable given that safety pharmacology was evaluated as part of the 1-month and 6-months 
repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys. The following parameters were evaluated: 
electrocardiograms, general veterinary and physical examinations with body temperature and blood 
pressure, clinical observations (within 1 to 3 hours post-dose), and histopathology of tissues from the 
cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, and nervous systems. No pembrolizumab-related effects were 
observed in any parameter evaluated. This limited safety pharmacology evaluation of pembrolizumab 
is supported by ICH guidelines S6(R1), S7A, and S9, which do not require specific safety pharmacology 
studies for biotechnology-derived products, such as monoclonal antibodies, or for anticancer 
pharmaceuticals.  
No non-clinical dedicated pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions studies with pembrolizumab were 
submitted. Since pembrolizumab is designed to modulate the functional activity of T lymphocytes, 
there is potential for pharmacodynamic drug-drug interactions of pembrolizumab in relation to 
cytotoxic, immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory therapies. In the SmPC section 4.5 it is reported 
to avoid the use of systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants before start of 
pembrolizumab treatment but systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used 
during pembrolizumab treatment to treat immune-related adverse reactions."Potential PD interaction 
with systemic immunosuppressants" is listed among the missing information in the RMP. 
The toxicity of pembrolizumab was evaluated in a 1-month and a 6-month repeat-dose study in 
cynomolgus monkeys. Overall, pembrolizumab was well tolerated and the NOAEL in both studies was 
the highest dose tested.  
The applicant did not submit studies for genotoxicity, carcinogenicity as well as fertility and early 
embryonic development.  This is acceptable as according to ICH guideline S6(R1) “Preclinical safety 
evaluation of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals” (EMA/CHMP/ICH/731268/1998), these studies 
Page 30/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
are not required and are not warranted to support marketing for therapeutics intended to treat 
patients with advanced cancer (ICH guideline S9 “Nonclinical evaluation for anticancer 
pharmaceuticals” EMEA/CHMP/ICH/646107/2008), the lack of studies is acceptable. 
No reproductive toxicity studies were submitted with pembrolizumab. According to the literature 
submitted, there appears to be sufficient weight of evidence suggests that pembrolizumab has an 
adverse effect on pregnancy outcome. Therefore, the lack of studies in animal models is acceptable 
and information on the potential for an adverse effect on pregnancy was included in section 5.3 of the 
SmPC. Pembrolizumab is not expected to cause adverse effects in the male and female reproductive 
system, however as the number of sexually mature male treated with pembrolizumab for a sufficiently 
long duration (≥ 3 months according to ICH S6(R1) was too low to draw any conclusions about the 
effect of pembrolizumab on male fertility, a statement has been included in the SmPC section 5.3.  
It is not known whether pembrolizumab is secreted in human milk. Since it is known that in general 
IgG antibodies are secreted in human milk, a decision should be made whether to discontinue nursing 
or to discontinue the drug, taking into account the importance of the treatment to the mother. 
Pembrolizumab adverse effect on pregnancy outcome and potential secretion in human milk are 
adequately reflected in sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC. "Reproductive and lactation data" and are 
listed as missing information in the RMP. 
The applicant did not submit separate local tolerance studies with pembrolizumab. This is acceptable as 
no clinical signs, macroscopic findings and histopathologic examination of the injection site (IV 
administration) were observed in the repeat dose toxicological studies. 
The applicant did not submit an ERA. According to the guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), in the 
case of products containing proteins as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), an ERA justifying the lack 
of ERA studies is acceptable. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In conclusion, the non-clinical studies (pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology), submitted for 
the marketing authorisation application for pembrolizumab, were considered adequate and acceptable 
for the assessment of non-clinical aspects. The lack of carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, fertility and early 
embryonic development was well justified. Based on the literature data, there is a potential risk for 
foetal loss in the third semester in humans. In addition, the Cynomolgus monkey model showed the 
development of ADAs after repeat administration. These risks are adequately addressed in the SmPC 
and RMP. 
The CHMP recommends the following measures necessary to address the non-clinical issues: 
• 
The Applicant is requested to submit the addendum to the validation report AR3607 (regarding the 
stability of labelled reagents used in PK studies in cynomolgus).

The initial application included data from Protocol 001, an open label Phase I study evaluating the 
safety,  tolerability,  pharmacokinetics  (PK),  pharmacodynamics,  and  anti-tumour  activity  of 
pembrolizumab in patients with melanoma (IPI-naïve or previously treated with IPI) and non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC).  
Part A (including A1 and A2) of the study involved dose escalation that used a traditional 3+3 
design and was an exploratory dose escalation in patients with solid tumours. Cohorts of 3- 6 
patients were enrolled sequentially at escalating doses of 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg administered every 2 
weeks (Q2W). Once the dose escalation was completed, additional patients were enrolled into Parts 
A1 and A2. Part B (B1, B2, and B3) and Part D investigate the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab 
in patients with advanced melanoma at dose regimens of 2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W or 10 
mg/kg Q2W.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK of pembrolizumab was investigated in patients with solid malignancies enrolled in the Phase I 
study, Protocol 001 titled ‘Phase I Study of Single Agent MK-3475 in Patients with Progressive Locally 
Advanced  or  Metastatic  Carcinoma,  Melanoma,  and  Non-Small  Cell  Lung  Carcinoma’  (P001).  PK  data 
were obtained through a combination of intensive (parts A, A1, A2) and sparse sampling (parts B1, B2, 
C  and  D)  using  a  clinical  data  cut-off  date  of  26-Jul-2013.  Additionally,  serum  samples  for  the 
assessment  of  ADA  were obtained  at  regular  intervals  during  the  study  (analysis  dataset  cut-off  date 
26-Jul-2013,  subsequent  analysis  update  with  cut-off  date  31-Dec-2013).  During  the  procedure,  the 
Applicant  presented  an  enlarged  data  set  based  on  a  pooled  dataset  across  studies  P001  and  P002 
(Total N=1139) with data cut-off date of 18-April-2014 for P001 and 12-May-2014 for P002. 
In study 001, the PK of pembrolizumab was investigated following i.v. administration of:  
•  Part A (including A1 and A2): 1, 3 or 10 mg/kg administered every 2 weeks (Q2W) 
•  Part B (B1, B2, and B3) and Part D:  2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W or 10 mg/kg Q2W 
•  Part C: 10 mg/kg Q3W. 
Absorption 
The applicant did not submit studies on absorption (see clinical pharmacology discussion). 
Distribution 
The volume of distribution of pembrolizumab at steady state is 8.1 L, in between the volumes of serum 
and extracellular water. Pembrolizumab has a clearance of 0.23 L/day and an elimination half-life (t½) 
of 26 days as determined by population PK modelling (Table 14). 
Steady-state  is  achieved  by  18  weeks  of  repeated  dosing,  with  ~2.1-fold  accumulation  in  exposure 
during  administration  every  3  weeks  relative  to  exposure  observed  following  single  dose 
administration.

Elimination 
The applicant did not submit studies on elimination or metabolism of pembrolizumab (see 
pharmacology discussion).  
Dose proportionality  
The PK of pembrolizumab following multiple-dose administration is consistent with that observed after 
single-dose  administration,  indicating  time-independent  disposition.  This  is  supported  by  the 
population PK model, that describes the observed concentrations following first-dose and multiple-dose 
Page 35/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
administration  across  a  range  of  doses  (1  to  10  mg/kg)  and  regimens  (Q2W  and  Q3W)  in  a  single 
integrated model with a linear clearance term.

Time dependencies 
Steady  state  of  pembrolizumab  was  achieved  in  18  weeks  (Figure  11).  The  accumulation  ratio  based 
on AUC at a Q3W dosing interval is 2.1. The majority (~82%) of this accumulation has occurred after 
the  third  dose.  Pembrolizumab  concentrations  both  after  single  dose  and  at  steady  state  can  be 
described  with  the  same  population  PK  model,  indicating  the  absence  of  any  time  dependency  in 
pembrolizumab pharmacokinetics (Figure below).

An initial pooled population PK analysis was performed to generate individual pembrolizumab exposure 
estimates to support exposure-response analysis for clinical efficacy and to support dose 
recommendations. The analysis included data from 476 patients from parts A, B1, B2, C, and D of 
protocol PN001. In total, 7034 PK observations were included in the analysis. Covariates included in 
the analysis were age, gender, creatine clearance, anti-drug antibody, race, tumour burden, ALP, 
AST,ALT, albumin and bilirubin, baseline ECOG performance status and geographical location. 
An updated pooled population PK analysis was also was performed to investigate the effects of selected 
covariates on pembrolizumab exposure in patients with melanoma and NSCLC, as included in study 
P001 and P002. The population PK analysis was performed using a non-linear mixed effects modelling 
approach. Model selection was based on the Log-Likelihood, goodness of fit plots and scientific 
plausibility. Identification of covariates was based on step-wise forward addition (at alpha level of 
0.01) and backward elimination (at alpha level of 0.001). The covariates tested included demographic 
factors (age, sex, diagnosis), a measure of renal function [baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate 
(eGFR) assessed by MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease formula)], measures of hepatic 
function (baseline total bilirubin, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT) and 
alkaline phosphatase (ALP), with degree of hepatic impairment classified according to NCI guidelines), 
laboratory parameters related to FcRn capacity (baseline albumin, IgG) and measures of disease 
severity [baseline ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) performance status and tumour size 
(SLD)].  
The results showed that age, gender, albumin, impaired renal and hepatic impairment had no impact 
on pembrolizumab PK parameters. Results from PopPK analysis showed that after incorporation of the 
effect of body weight, most of the investigated covariates had no effect on the PK of pembrolizumab.   
Weight 
Within the population PK model, clearance and volume parameters of pembrolizumab were found to be 
dependent on body weight when dose is accounted for in the model on an absolute (mg) level (Figure 
13). Body weight was not included in the list of covariates that were investigated, as it was included as 
a covariate on clearance and volume terms as part of the structural model.  
The population PK model results have been applied to investigate the dependency of pembrolizumab 
exposure on body weight in the general population under body weight normalized dosing. Under this 
dosing paradigm, body weight has a limited impact on exposure, with the lowest exposure in the 
lowest weight class and the highest in the highest weight class.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
PD-1 is an immune-checkpoint receptor that limits the activity of T lymphocytes in peripheral tissues. 
The PD-1 pathway is an immune control checkpoint that may be engaged by tumour cells to inhibit 
active T-cell immune surveillance. Pembrolizumab is a high affinity antibody against PD-1, which exerts 
dual ligand blockade of the PD-1 pathway, including PD-L1 and PD-L2, on antigen presenting or 
tumour cells. By inhibiting the PD-1 receptor from binding to its ligands, pembrolizumab reactivates 
tumour-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes in the tumour microenvironment and reactivates anti-tumour 
immunity. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Functional activity of pembrolizumab to PD-1 from healthy subjects and cancer patients  
The ability of pembrolizumab to modulate the activity of T-cells was assessed in vitro using peripheral 
blood from healthy human donors or patients with cancer. Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB) was 
used to activate T-cells for the production of cytokines including interleukin (IL)-2 (Study PD002 report 
SN 09545). 
WBC isolated form healthy volunteers, prostate and melanoma cancer patients and were cultured in 
the presence or absence of pembrolizumab, its murine precursor PD-1.09A, abatacept and a 
neutralizing anti-CTLA4 antibody (ipilimumab (Yervoy) (all used 25ug/ml). Cells were then stimulated 
with SEB.  The results for cancer patients are presented in Figure 15. The results in healthy donors 
were comparable with those observed in cancer patients. 
Page 39/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 15: 
PD-1 blockade enhances IL-2 production in blood cells from prostate and 
advanced melanoma patients 
To demonstrate that antigen-specific T cell receptor triggering was modulated by anti-PD-1, a human 
T-cell recall assay for tetanus toxoid (TT) was used. Pre-existing memory T-cells in PBMC from healthy 
human donors were stimulated with TT (7 days) and the production of interferon (IFN)-gamma in the 
culture supernatants was determined after incubation with mouse anti-PD-1.09A, anti-CTLA4 or with a 
dose range of SCH 900475 by ELISA. Results were in agreement with the IL-2 assay. 
In addition to IL-2, TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-6 and IL-17 were found to be enhanced by PD-1 blockade (either 
PD-1.09A or MK-3475) in SEB-stimulated blood from healthy donors, prostate cancer patients and 
advanced melanoma cancer patients (Figure 16). IL-5 was decreased, while no modulation was 
observed for IL-13,  FGF, IL-1β, IL-1Ra, IL-4, IL-7, IL-8, IL-9, IL-10, IL-12p70, IL-15, G-CSF, GM-CSF, 
IP-10, MCP-1, MIP-1α, MIP-1β, PDGF, RANTES, and VEGF (data not shown).

Early population PK/PD modelling based on ex-vivo IL-2 release measured in solid tumor patients. 
Target engagement was analysed in an ex-vivo IL-2 stimulation assay. Results obtained from blood 
samples in patients with solid tumour were included in the early PK/PD model. The assay measured 
post-dose reduction in the ex-vivo stimulation ratio (SEB w/o addition of 25µg/mL pembrolizumab) as 
an indirect measure of PD-1 receptor occupancy on T-cells. A reduction of IL-2 stimulation ratio 
indicated high pre-existing receptor occupancy. The maximum response was a 2.7-fold increase of the 
IL-2 stimulation ratio. Furthermore, in the lower dose range, a plateau was only hypothesized and the 
differences in the IL-2 stimulation ratio obtained with different doses was found to be very little. In 
light of this, the assay’s reliability is questionable. The early PK/PD model is based on poor data 
Page 41/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
source, coming from assumptions (which may not be true at the tumour site) and therefore the PK/PD 
relationship results inconclusive. Furthermore, plasma concentration values were not simultaneously 
measured. Overall, the model is not considered robust enough for the simulation.  
A nonlinear mixed effects model of tumour size as quantified by SLD has been developed to describe 
tumour size as a function of underlying tumour growth rate and tumour kill rate due to PD-1 inhibition. 
The  model-estimated  relative  tumour  size  response  at  Week  28,  presented  as  categories  similar  to 
those  used  in  RECIST,  versus  exposure  or  dose.  Results  indicated  the  absence  of  a  clear  association 
between exposure (or dose) and efficacy. 
Exposure-response simulation 
The  relationship  of  plasma  concentration  and  effect  was  analysed  in  a  tumour  size  reduction  model 
based on a total of 365 melanoma patients with a median number of tumour size measurements of 3 
(1-14)  per  patient  and  median  time  to  last  scan  of  16  weeks  (maximum  93  weeks).  No  clinically 
relevant  exposure-response  relationship  was  observed.  In  addition,  no  differences  were  seen  across 
the  wide  range  of  exposures  (<660  µg/ml  to  >8010  µg/ml)  and  doses  (1  to  10  mg/kg).  Altogether 
these evidences indicated that efficacy is near to plateau. Moreover, results suggest that 1 mg/kg Q3W 
may be sufficient to achieve clinical efficacy.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology profile of pembrolizumab has been characterised based on data from study 
P001, a phase I study expanded cohorts of patients, investigating pembrolizumab doses of 1, 2, 3 and 
10 mg/kg at various dosing schedules ( see  section 2.4.1) and study P002, a phase II study 
investigating 2mg/kg and 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The studies were conducted in melanoma patients 
as well as in patients with other solid tumours (eg. NSCLC).  
The dose proposed for pembrolizumab monotherapy is 2 mg/kg administered over 30 min every 3 
weeks. 
The applicant did not submit studies on absorption, bioavailability or food effect as pembrolizumab is 
administered via the i.v. route and is therefore completely (100%) bioavailable (SmPC section 5.2). 
Since the expected consequence of metabolism of pembrolizumab is degradation to small peptides and 
single amino acid, as per ICH S6(R1) guideline, the lack of studies submitted for elimination, excretion 
and metabolism [e.g., cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs), glucuronosyltransferases] is acceptable.  
Consistent  with  a  limited  extravascular  distribution,  the  volume  of  distribution  of  pembrolizumab  at 
steady  state  is  small  (approximately  8.1L,  CV:22%)  and  between  the  volumes  of  serum  and 
extracellular water. Pembrolizumab does not bind to plasma proteins binds to receptors for the IgG4 Fc 
region.  The  systemic  clearance  of  pembrolizumab  is  ~0.2  L/day  (CV:  41%)  and  the  terminal  half  life 
(t½) is ~26 days (CV: 43%).  
Dose proportionality studies showed that exposure increased with dose from 1 to 10 mg/kg. Cmax and 
AUC0-28  increased  in  a  supra-proportional  manner.  However,  no  clear  conclusion  can  be  drawn 
because  of  the  low  number  of  patients  at  the  two  lower  doses  (N  =  4  for  1  mg/kg  and  N  =  3  for  3 
mg/kg, compared to N = 10 at 10 mg/kg). Mean estimated t½ values range from 14.1 to 21.6 days. 
Exposure  to  pembrolizumab  as  expressed  by  peak  concentration  (Cmax)  or  area  under  the 
plasma  concentration  time  curve  (AUC)  increased  dose  proportionally  within  the  dose  range  for 
efficacy. Upon repeated dosing, the clearance of pembrolizumab was found to be independent of time, 
and systemic accumulation was approximately 2.1 fold when administered every 3 weeks. Near steady 
state concentrations of pembrolizumab were achieved by 18 weeks; the mean Cmin at 18 weeks was 
approximately  22  mcg/mL  at  a  dose  of  2  mg/kg  every  3  weeks.  The  majority  (~82%)  of  this 
Page 44/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
accumulation  occurred  after  the  third  dose.  In  the  dose  range  studied  for  efficacy  (2  –  10  mg/kg) 
pembrolizumab  exposure  increases  in  a  dose-proportional  manner,  with  clearance  being  independent 
of time or pembrolizumab concentration. Pembrolizumab has relatively low to moderate PK variability 
[inter  subject  coefficient  of  variation  (CV)  of  22-41%].  As  also  observed  with  other  therapeutic 
antibodies  (trastuzumab,  pertuzumab),  there  is  a  deviation  from  linearity  in  the  low  dose  range  (≤  1 
mg/kg),  which  is  linked  to  a  decrease  of  CL  with  increasing  doses.  With  doses  higher  than  2  mg/kg, 
however, exposure increases in a dose-proportional way. 
The  effects  of  various  covariates  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  pembrolizumab  were  assessed  in 
population pharmacokinetic analyses. The clearance of pembrolizumab increased with increasing body 
weight; resulting exposure differences are adequately addressed by administration on a mg/kg basis. 
The  choice  to  apply  a  body  weight-based  dosing  regimen  for  pembrolizumab  seemed  appropriate  to 
control  the  resulting  variability  in  exposure  across  a  broad  range  of  body  weights.  The  observed 
increasing  trend  in  AUCss  with  body  weight  appears  to  be  related  to  the  effect  of  body  weight  on 
clearance, and is unrelated to the observed effect on volume of distribution. The following factors had 
no clinically important effect on the clearance of pembrolizumab: age (range 15 to 94 years), gender, 
mild  or  moderate  renal  impairment,  mild  hepatic  impairment,  and  tumour  burden.  The  effect  of  race 
could  not  be  assessed  due  to  limited  data  available  in  non  Caucasian  ethnic  groups.  No  overall 
differences  in  clearance  were  reported  between  elderly  patients  (65  years  and  over)  and  younger 
patients  (less  than  65  years),  and  for  this  reason  no  dose  adjustment  was  recommended  in  this 
population (see section 4.2 of the SmPC).  
The impact of renal or hepatic impairment on pembrolizumab PK has not been studied. Renal function 
has no impact on pembrolizumab clearance when evaluated as continuous covariate or as categorical 
classification of impairment severity. At the same time, bilirubin, AST, ALT and ALP had no impact on 
clearance  in  patients  with  mild  hepatic  impairment  and  no  dose  adjustment  was  needed  in  these 
patients  (see  section  4.2  and  5.2  of  the  SmPC)  and  has  been  included  as  missing  information  in  the 
RMP.  
Interaction  with  systemic  corticosteroids  (glucocorticoids)  administration  was  assessed  as  potential 
covariate in the population PK analysis. The population PK analysis showed that concomitant treatment 
of  pembrolizumab  with  corticosteroids  had  no  significant  impact  on  pembrolizumab  exposure  (P  = 
0.77). Information about the lack of drug interaction studies and about concomitant administration of 
corticosteroid are included in section 4.5 of the SmPC and as missing information in the RMP. 
The ex-vivo biomarker (IL-2 release from PBMC) study supports the lowest dose studied in the clinical 
program.  The  PK/PD  evaluations  and  the  IL-2  PK/PD  model    provided  an  hypothesis  for  the  clinical 
response based on human PK data and preclinical efficacy of an anti-PD-1 antibody.   
The ability of pembrolizumab to modulate the activity of T-cells was assessed in vitro using peripheral 
blood  from  healthy  human  donors  or  patients  with  cancer.    This  evaluation  was  based  on  the 
assumption  that  the  target  engagement  processes  (including  potential  receptor  up-regulation)  in  the 
peripheral blood cells were similar to tumour cells. Peripheral whole blood samples from healthy donors 
and  melanoma  cancer  patients  were  assayed  to  determine  the  release  of  IL-2.  Following  activation 
with Staphylococcus enterotoxin B (SEB), pembrolizumab was equally able to enhance the IL-2 release 
from  both  in  healthy  subjects  and  melanoma  cancer  patients.  Pembrolizumab  enhanced  the  T-cell 
production of IL-2 induced by SEB up to ~3 to 4-fold in a dose-dependent fashion. Pembrolizumab also 
demonstrated enhanced tetanus toxoid (TT)-mediated production of IFN-gamma.  
Thus,  T-cell  activation  in  peripheral  blood  of  melanoma  patients  as  well  as  the  predicted  tumor  size 
reduction in response to pembrolizumab both appear to be moderate, and both analyses suggest dose-
Page 45/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
independence in the clinical dose range (2 mg/kg q3w and 10 mg/kg q3w). However, the assumption 
of exposure independence on the basis of the tumor-size-reduction model is not considered reliable as 
the  exposure  value  used  for  modelling  of  its  relationship  to  tumor-growth  is  derived  from  the 
population  PK  model.  The  high  variability  in  the  melanoma  source  data  of  the  tumor-size  reduction 
model  suggest  that  the  response  to  pembrolizumab  is  not  uniform  and  varies  for  individual  patients, 
which is conceivable for a drug with an immune-mediated mechanism of action. However, this aspect 
also  complicates  the  evaluation  of  an  exposure  response  relationship.  In  consequence,  despite  the 
acknowledged  modelling  effort  no  quantitative  assumptions  should  be  drawn  on 
the 
pharmacodynamics effect of pembrolizumab from the submitted data. 
The presence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and their neutralizing ability was assessed in 4042 samples 
taken from 1094 subjects. ADA concentration results obtained in 729, out of the 997 assessable 
patients were considered inconclusive, due to the circulating pembrolizumab above the test tolerance 
level. Only in 268 patients ADA results were conclusively assessed; four patients were declared ADA 
positive at screening and in the confirmatory assay; in one patient ADAs were seen as treatment 
emergent. This single patient with a treatment-emergent immunogenicity response and no impact on 
the exposure to pembrolizumab was found.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In conclusion, pharmacokinetics of pembrolizumab has been mainly characterised by means of a 
population PK model which is considered acceptable. The body weight-based dosing regimen is 
considered justified as body weight may have a relative impact on exposure for patients in the lowest 
and highest weight classes,   
The CHMP recommends the following measures to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
• 
The Applicant is requested to provide the validation report for neutralizing antibodies assay. In 
addition, the matrix interferences for NSCLC samples and the matrix effects in unfortified lipemic 
human serum samples in the ADA assay should be addressed and results should be reported.

The development program for pembrolizumab in advanced melanoma has focused on doses that have 
a  high  likelihood  of  providing  a  meaningful  efficacy  response.  PD-1  receptor  occupancy  on  circulating 
T-cells was measured as an indication of target engagement. In addition, an ex-vivo assay measuring 
induction  of  IL-2  (a  measure  of  T-cell  activity)  was  used  to  assess  functional  modulation  of  target 
activity on circulating T-cells by pembrolizumab.  
These two types of PK-PD evaluations (a clinical biomarker approach and a translational projection of 
clinical  response  based  on  pre-clinical  efficacy)  converge  on  supporting  the  use  of  2  mg/kg  Q3W  as 
lower  end  of  the  dose  range  in  the  program.  As  no  DLT  has  been  observed  in  Part  A  of  study  P001, 
higher doses (10 mg/kg Q3W or Q2W) have been also explored.  
Exposure  response  analysis  of  tumour  size  data  was  used  to  characterize  the  relationship  between 
exposure  to  pembrolizumab  and  tumour  size  reduction  in  the  clinical  dose  range  of  1  mg/kg  to  10 
mg/kg.

Graphical  exploration  was  conducted  on  tumour  size  observations,  i.e.,  observed  tumour  size  per 
RECIST  sum  of  longest  dimensions  (SLD)  relative  to  baseline  at  specified  time  intervals  (landmark 
analysis).

Graphical  exploration  of  MK-3475  anti-tumour  efficacy  indicated  lack  of 
clinically  relevant  exposure-response  relationship  (randomised  patients  – 
Parts B2 and D)  
In addition to the scatter plots with regression line, box plots across were also provided. Each box 
represents the (25th – 75th) percentile spread. For each category, the number of subjects is split 
roughly into 6 equal buckets. As a point of reference, the median exposure for the 2 mg/kg Q3W dose 
group is 1617 mg.day/L, the median exposure for the 10 mg/kg Q3W dose group is 9425 mg.day/L 
and that for the 10 mg/kg Q2W is 13757 mg.day/L, yielding an exposure range of 8.63.

Objectives 
Primary 
1) To evaluate the progression-free-survival (PFS) in subjects with ipilimumab refractory advanced 
melanoma receiving either pembrolizumab or chemotherapy. 
2) To evaluate the overall survival (OS) in subjects with ipilimumab refractory advanced melanoma 
receiving either pembrolizumab or chemotherapy. 
Secondary 
1) To evaluate the overall response rate (ORR) in subjects with ipilimumab refractory advanced 
melanoma receiving either pembrolizumab or chemotherapy. 
2) To evaluate the response duration in subjects with ipilimumab refractory advanced melanoma 
receiving either pembrolizumab or chemotherapy. 
3) To evaluate OS, PFS, and ORR in the biomarker positive subgroup defined by programmed cell 
death 1 ligand (PDL1) expression level (cutoff point to be estimated from external data) receiving 
either pembrolizumab or chemotherapy. 
4) To further characterize the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of single agent pembrolizumab at 2 mg/kg 
and 10 mg/kg. 
5) To evaluate safety, tolerability and adverse experience profile of single agent pembrolizumab 2 
mg/kg and 10 mg/kg. 
Key exploratory 
1) To evaluate health-related quality of life changes from baseline in patients with ipilimumab 
refractory melanoma treated with pembrolizumab compared to patients treated with chemotherapy 
using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire 
C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Co-Primary endpoints 
1) Progression-Free-Survival (PFS) was based on assessment from a central imaging vendor using the 
RECIST 1.1 criteria, or death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. 
Progression-free survival is defined as the time from randomization to the first documented disease 
progression (based on assessment from a central imaging vendor using the RECIST 1.1 criteria) or 
death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. See protocol ([16.1.1], Section 3.5.5.1) for definition 
of censoring. For patients whose subsequent assessments right after RECIST-defined PD show a stable 
disease or better and who remains on study treatment, a sensitivity analysis will be conducted that 
does not count the initial RECIST defined PD assessment as an event. Analysis of PFS based on 
investigator assessment using RECIST 1.1 will be performed as a supportive analysis. 
2) Overall Survival (OS) was defined as the time from randomization to documented death due to any 
cause. 
Patients without documented death at the time of the final analysis will be censored at the date of the 
last follow-up. 
Page 52/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary endpoints 
1) Overall Response Rate (ORR) was defined as the proportion of the subjects in the analysis 
population who had a complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). Responses were based on 
confirmed assessments from a central imaging vendor using the RECIST 1.1 criteria. 
2) Confirmed CR or PR at the time from first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease 
progression or death. 
3) ORR, PFS and OS in the biomarker positive subgroup: 
•  ORR: Based on proportion of subjects with complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) 
based on confirmed central review assessment (IRO) using RECIST 1.1 criteria by PD-L1 
expression level. 
• 
PFS: Based on assessment of independent central review (IRO) using RECIST 1.1 by PD-L1 
expression level from randomization until progression or death due to any cause, whichever 
occurred first. 
•  OS: Based on time from randomization to death due to any cause by PD-L1 expression level. 
The PD-L1 cutoff point was defined and validated using data from the melanoma subjects in P001 prior 
to any biomarker analysis in P002. PD-L1 positive is defined as Allred proportion score (APS) of 2 or 
higher and PD-L1 negative is defined as APS of 0 or 1. 
Key Exploratory endpoints 
1) The key PRO endpoint was the score changes from baseline and the proportions of 
improvement/deterioration at week 12, as measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 global health 
status/quality of life score. 
2) The supportive PRO Endpoints were the score changes from baseline and the proportions of 
improvement/deterioration at week 12, as measured by each of the EORTC QLQ-C30 functional 
subscales and each of the 
Sample size 
The study is OS event-driven and planned to randomize 510 patients with a 1:1:1 ratio into two 
pembrolizumab arms (2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) and one control arm. If one of the pembrolizumab arms 
discontinued at the interim analysis, the study would complete after 245 deaths have occurred in the 
remaining pembrolizumab arm and the control arm.  
The sample size calculation was based on the following assumptions: 1) overall survival follows an 
exponential distribution with a median of six months in the control arm; 2) the hazard ratio between 
pembrolizumab and control is 0.65; 3) an enrollment period of 15 months and a minimum of 9 months 
follow-up after enrollment completion; and 4) a drop-out rate of 2% in 12 months. If both 
pembrolizumab arms continued to the end, barring early stopping at interim analyses, the study would 
complete after 370 deaths had occurred (i.e., a 50% increase from 245). 
The overall type I error rate for this study was strictly controlled at 2.5% (one-sided) with 0.5% 
allocated to PFS at the second interim analysis and 2% allocated to OS. PFS was only be tested at the 
second interim analysis. The Bonferroni method was used for testing the two null hypotheses on PFS at 
the second interim analysis with each tested at 0.25%. If any of the two null hypotheses was rejected, 
the corresponding alpha level was rolled into the overall OS hypothesis (i.e., the OS hypothesis tested 
Page 53/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
at 2%, 2.25% and 2.5% respectively if none, exactly one and both hypotheses were rejected at the 
second interim analysis). 
The PFS hypotheses will be tested at the second interim analysis when all patients were enrolled and at 
least 270 PFS events among three arms (at least 180 PFS events if one MK- 3475 arm is discontinued 
at IA 1) have occurred. By the time of the second interim analysis, approximately 180 to 200 PFS 
events should have occurred between one pembrolizumab arm and the control arm. With 180-200 PFS 
events, the study had 88% to 92% power to detect a hazard ratio of 0.55 in PFS between a 
pembrolizumab arm and control at alpha=0.25% (one-sided). The sample size and power calculation 
for PFS were based on the following assumptions: 1) PFS follows an exponential distribution with a 
median of 2 months in the control arm, 2) the hazard ratio between pembrolizumab and control is 
0.55, 3) an enrollment period of 15 months. 
With 2% to 2.5% type I error allocated to OS (depending on the number of PFS hypotheses being 
positive at the second interim analysis), the reference type I error rate is 1% to 1.25% between one 
pembrolizumab arm and control. With 245 deaths between a pembrolizumab arm and control, the 
study had 85% power to detect a 0.65 hazard ratio and 95% power to detect a 0.6 hazard ratio on OS 
at alpha=1%. 
Randomisation 
An interactive voice response system (IVRS)/IXRS was used to centrally randomize subjects. Prior to 
entering information into IVRS, the Investigator defined the chemotherapy treatment of Investigator 
choice (TIC) for each subject in the event the subject was randomized to the chemotherapy arm. 
Patients were randomised to one of the following treatments: 
a)  180 subjects randomized to receive pembrolizumab (MK-3475) 2 mg/kg every three weeks (Q3W)  
b)  181 subjects randomized to receive pembrolizumab (MK-3475) 10 mg/kg every three weeks 
(Q3W) 
c)  179 subjects randomized to receive chemotherapy administered according to SOC 
The randomization of enrolled subjects was stratified based on ECOG performance (0 vs. 1), lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) levels (normal versus elevated LDH levels) and BRAF mutational status. 
Blinding (masking) 
The pembrolizumab (MK-3475) dosing assignment was blinded to site and the applicant’s personnel 
directly associated with the conduct of the trial. The study site assigned a designated unblinded 
pharmacist who was responsible for preparing the pembrolizumab study medication that was 
administered to the subject in a blinded fashion. 
The applicant had access to individual study medication data (except for the dose information of 
pembrolizumab) for medical monitoring purpose, while the treatment assignment (pembrolizumab 2 
mg/kg, pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg) was blinded according to in-house blinding procedures. 
Pembrolizumab doses remained blinded for medical monitoring. 
Statistical methods 
An outline of the efficacy analysis strategy is presented in Table 15. 
Page 54/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 15: 
Primary analysis strategy for efficacy endpoints 
There were two planned interim analyses for this study. Table 16 summarizes the strategy and timing 
of each interim analysis. 
Table 16: 
Summary of interim analysis strategy 
The first IA occurred after the first 120 randomized patients have a minimum of 3 months follow-up 
(approximately 10 months into the study). The primary objective of this analysis was to discontinue 2 
mg/kg or 10 mg/kg from the study if one arm is clearly not as effective as the other arm. Only 
responses from two pembrolizumab arms (2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) were compared in this analysis. 
The overall response rate based on assessments from a central imaging vendor between the 10 mg/kg 
and the 2 mg/kg arms was  evaluated. If the p-value of the difference of response rate is less than 
10% (two-sided), the MK arm with lower observed response rate will be discontinued. A 15% 
difference (i.e., 25% in one arm and 10% in the other) will approximately meet the criterion for 
discontinuing the less effective arm. There was no intention to stop the trial for efficacy or futility at 
Page 55/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
this analysis. To prevent the study from premature stopping, a nominal alpha of 0.001% is spent on 
the OS hypothesis with negligible impact on the overall type I error rate. 
The IA2 was planned to occur when all study subjects had been enrolled and at least 270 PFS events 
had been observed among three arms. It was expected that at least 240 subjects would have a 
minimum of 4 months follow-up and approximately 210 deaths at the time of IA2, assuming no 
pembrolizumab arms would be dropped earlier. Between-treatment comparison of OS was tested using 
stratified log-rank test, the hazard ratio and its 95% confidence interval was estimated using the 
stratified Cox model with efron’s tie handling. OS curve is estimated using Kaplan-Meier (KM) method 
in each treatment group. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Table 17: 
Disposition of subjects (ITT population) 
At the time of this interim analysis, 86 SOC chemotherapy subjects had crossed over to the 
pembrolizumab treatment arm (2 or 10 mg/kg Q3W). Of these 86 subjects, 33 (38.4%) remained in 
the study on pembrolizumab, 1 (1.2%) subject discontinued treatment due to AE, and 48 (55.8%) 
discontinued treatment due to progressive disease.

Disposition of subjects (crossover population) 
Recruitment 
As of data cut-off date (12-May-2014), the trial was conducted in 73 trial centers worldwide: 34 trial 
centers in the United States; 11 in Germany; 5 in France; 4 trial centers each for Netherlands, Spain, 
Page 56/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and Switzerland; 3 trial centers each for Israel and Italy; 2 in Argentina; 1 trial center each for 
Australia, Norway, and Sweden. 
Conduct of the study 
There were 333 subjects randomized under the original protocol (P002-00), 205 subjects randomized 
under amendment 01 (P002-01), and two subjects randomized under amendment 02 (P002-02). 
Amendment 01 
Key changes included modification to indication statement for clarity, modifications to the primary and 
secondary objectives (moved ORR from primary to secondary, removed evaluations for ORR, OS, and 
disease control rate [DCR] at Week 12). Additional key changes included modification to the IPI-
refractory definition in the Inclusion Criteria (provided minimum IPI dose; added text to indicate that 
PD is based on irRC; clarified requirements in the absence of rapid clinical progression, added sponsor 
collection of imaging scans, and clarification in documenting date of progression); revised Inclusion 
Criterion to specify that lesions must be measured radiologically. There were modifications to the 
timing for the second (move to 15 months; occur after study enrollment was completed) and final 
analyses as well as clarifications to the efficacy measurements (defined minimal criteria that must be 
met in subject with radiological PD at Week 12 assessment which enabled the subject to continue 
receiving pembrolizumab). 
Additional changes were in response to Investigator feedback and additional information gained in the 
progression of P001 trial. Amendment 01 also reflected changes in Inclusion Criteria regarding baseline 
samples collected for biomarker analysis (only newly obtained tumor tissue was acceptable) and 
updated the eligibility age (deleted ≥ 16 years of age and replaced with ≥ 18 years of age). Exclusion 
Criteria was revised to exclude subjects who received ipilimumab only as an adjuvant therapy. 
Chemotherapy treatment arm options were reduced in response to regulatory agency feedback: 
carboplatin monotherapy and temozolomide IV were removed; specified dosing regimens for the 
chemotherapy option.  
Progression of the cancer under study is not considered an SAE unless it results in hospitalization. 
Death unrelated to the study medication and due to progressive melanoma is not considered an SAE. 
Death unrelated to the study medication and due to clinical signs or symptoms of progressive 
melanoma (without meeting RECIST 1.1 requirement for PD) is reported as an SAE. 
Amendment 02 
Key changes included modification to the efficacy analysis sections (revised test regarding Full Analysis 
Set [FAS], added ITT to ORR analysis), updated dose modification guidelines to indicate that 
pembrolizumab will be withheld in the event of a Grade 4 drug-related hematologic toxicity, modified 
the supportive care guidelines for Grade 2 and Grade 3 reactions, added a section providing guidance 
for recommended treatment in subjects who experienced pneumonitis during the trial.  
Cross-over to pembrolizumab treatment arm 
Subjects in the control arm were allowed to cross over to pembrolizumab arm (dose level pre-decided 
at original randomization) after Week 12 and once the progressive disease was confirmed by the IRO. 
By the time of the data cutoff for IA2 (i.e., 12 May 2014), a total of 86 of 179 subjects (48%) who 
were randomized to the control arm had crossed over and were treated with pembrolizumab.

Numbers analysed 
The intention-to-treat (ITT) population served as the primary population for the analyses of PFS and 
OS in this study. Both ITT population and Full Analysis Set (FAS) population were used for analysis of 
overall ORR. The FAS included all randomized patients with measurable disease at baseline, which was 
defined separately under investigator evaluation and independent radiologic review. Subjects were 
included in the treatment group to which they were randomized for the analysis of efficacy data using 
both the ITT and FAS populations. The primary efficacy endpoints were PFS (i.e., time from 
randomization to documented progressive disease or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first) 
Page 61/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
based on blinded central reviews from an external imaging vendor per RECIST 1.1 and OS (i.e., the 
time from randomization to death due to any cause). The secondary endpoints for this study were ORR 
based on confirmed responses from blinded central reviews and response duration. Progression-free 
survival and ORR based on investigator’s assessment was analyzed as supportive analyses. 
The All-Patients-as-Treated (APaT) population was employed for safety analyses.

Outcomes and estimation – Interim Analysis 2 
Co-primary endpoint: PFS analyses based on IRO evaluation  
Study P002 compared the activity of pembrolizumab in IPI-refractory melanoma versus investigator’s 
choice of chemotherapy. Both pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q3W treatment arms met 
the pre-specified criteria for a positive PFS outcome at the second interim analysis, with a HR of 0.57 
and 0.50 for the 2 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg treatment arms compared to chemotherapy. The median PFS 
was  similar  in  the  three  treatment  arms,  at  2.7  months  for  the  chemotherapy  control  arm  and  2.9 
months  for  both  pembrolizumab  arms  by  independent  central  review  (IRO),  and  coincides 
approximately  with  the  first  scheduled  disease  assessment  at  Week  12.  Although  the  number  of 
subjects  at  risk  at  longer  time  points  is  small  at  the  time  of  the  interim  analysis,  curves  for 
pembrolizumab  appear  to  flatten  out,  with  around  22%  (at  2  mg/kg  Q3W)  and  24%  (at  10  mg/kg 
Q3W)  of  subjects  in  the  pembrolizumab  arms  appearing  to  derive  PFS  benefit  from  treatment  at  one 
year and beyond, in comparison to 4% of patients in the chemotherapy arm.

Co-primary endpoint: OS analyses  
The data on OS is summarised in Table 24 and Figure 24. The median OS was 11.4 months in the 
pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W arm, 12.5 months in the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q3W arm, and 11.6 
months in the control arm. The results were not statistically significant at the time of the IA2.

A sensitivity analysis of OS was conducted where subjects were censored at the time of crossover. The 
hazard ratio was 0.85 for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W over the control group and 0.75 for 
pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q3W over the control group.  
Secondary endpoint: ORR based on IRO per RECIST 1.1 
The ORR for pembrolizumab was 21.1% and 25.4% in the 2 mg/kg Q3W arm and 10 mg/kg Q3W arm, 
respectively, compared to 4.5% in the control arm (see Table 25).

Study P006: A Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled, Three-Arm, Phase III 
Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Two Dosing Schedules of MK-
3475 Compared to Ipilimumab in Patients with Advanced Melanoma – 
Interim Analysis 1 (IA1) and 2 (IA2) 
Methods 
This is a randomized, controlled, open-label, three-arm pivotal study of two dosing regimens of 
intravenous (IV) pembrolizumab versus IPI in patients with unresectable or metastatic MEL who have 
not received IPI treatment. 
Study Participants  
Main inclusion criteria: 
1.  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of unresectable stage III or metastatic melanoma not 
amenable to local therapy. 
• 
• 
• 
Patient may not have a diagnosis of uveal or ocular melanoma. 
Patients who have not received prior systemic treatment (excluding adjuvant or 
neoadjuvant therapy) for melanoma (first line) or who have received one prior systemic 
treatment (excluding adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy) for melanoma (second line) are 
both eligible. 
Patients must have testing for a BRAF mutation prior to study entry. Patients with BRAF 
V600E mutant melanoma may have received prior BRAF inhibitor therapy as first-line 
systemic therapy and be eligible for this study as second line treatment. At the discretion 
of the investigator, patients with BRAF V600E mutant melanoma who have NOT received a 
BRAF inhibitor are also eligible for this study as first line treatment if they meet the 
following additional criteria: 
o 
LDH < local ULN 
Page 71/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
o  No clinically significant tumor related symptoms in the judgment of the investigator 
o  Absence of rapidly progressing metastatic melanoma in the judgment of the 
investigator 
2.  ECOG 0 or 1 and adequate organ function 
3.  Patient has a tumor sample (archival or newly obtained biopsy) that is adequate for PD-L1 
assessment prior to randomization. Patients will be eligible to participate regardless of the level 
of PD-L1 expression, but will be stratified by PD-L1 expression level (high or low PD-L1 
expression level) at the time of randomization 
4.  Measurable disease 
Main exclusion criteria: 
1.  Patient had prior treatment with IPI or other anti-CTLA-4 agent, any anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or 
anti- PD-L2 agent. 
2.  Patient who has had chemotherapy, radioactive, or biological cancer therapy within four weeks 
prior to the first dose of study drug, or who has not recovered to CTCAE Grade 1 or better from 
the AEs due to cancer therapeutics administered more than four weeks earlier. 
3.  Patient is currently participating or has participated in a study of an investigational agent or 
using an investigational device within 30 days of the first dose of study drug. 
4.  Patient is expected to require any other form of systemic or localized antineoplastic therapy 
while on study. 
5.  Patient is on any systemic corticosteroid therapy within one week before the planned date for 
first dose of randomized treatment or on any other form of immunosuppressive medication. 
6.  Patient has a history of a malignancy (other than the disease under treatment in the study) 
within 5 years prior to first study drug administration. This should exclude adequately treated 
Stage 1 or Stage 2 basal/squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in situ of the cervix 
or breast, or other in situ cancers. 
7.  Patient has known active central nervous system (CNS) metastases and/or carcinomatous 
meningitis. Patients with previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they 
are stable (without evidence of progression by MRI for at least four weeks prior to the first 
dose of study drug), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases and are off 
systemic steroids for at least two weeks. 
8.  Patient previously had a severe hypersensitivity reaction to treatment with another mAb. 
9.  Patient has an active autoimmune disease or a documented history of autoimmune disease or 
syndrome that requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Patients with vitiligo 
or resolved childhood asthma/atopy would be an exception to this rule. Patients that require 
intermittent use of bronchodilators or local steroid injections would not be excluded from the 
study. Patients with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement will not be excluded from 
the study. 
10. Patient has an active infection requiring systemic therapy. 
11. Patient has known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies). 
Page 72/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
12. Patient has a known history of or is positive for Hepatitis B (HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C 
(HCV RNA [qualitative] is detected). 
13. Patient has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality 
that might confound the results of the study, interfere with the patient’s participation for the 
full duration of the study, or is not in the best interest of the patient to participate, in the 
opinion of the treating Investigator. 
14. Patient has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with 
cooperation with the requirements of the trial. 
15. Patient is, at the time of signing informed consent, a regular user (including “recreational use”) 
of any illicit drugs or had a recent history (within the last year) of substance abuse (including 
alcohol). 
16. Patient is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the 
projected duration of the study. 
17. Patient has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to first dose. 
Treatments 
Patients randomized to one of the pembrolizumab arms received pembrolizumab as IV infusion at a 
dose of 10 mg/kg given once every 2 weeks or once every 3 weeks, for up to 2 years until disease 
progression, intolerable toxicity, confirmed complete response, withdrawal of consent, or they require 
another form of antineoplastic therapy as determined by the Investigator. Patients randomized to the 
IPI arm will receive IPI at 3 mg/kg as IV infusion once every 3 weeks for a total of 4 doses. 
Patients on the IPI arm will receive IPI treatment for a total of 4 doses according to the label. Patients 
will remain on study and will continue to be monitored with scheduled disease assessments up to 24 
months as described in the protocol for safety and efficacy evaluations until disease progression, 
unacceptable toxicity, the withdrawal of consent, or they require another form of antineoplastic 
therapy as determined by the Investigator. Patients receiving IPI are not eligible for re-treatment with 
IPI as part of study treatment. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study is to evaluate for superiority of pembrolizumab to IPI in PFS or OS. 
The overall type I error rate for this study is strictly controlled at 2.5% (one-sided) with 0.5% 
allocated to PFS and 2.0% allocated to the overall OS hypothesis. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint of the study will be progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). 
Other endpoints include response rate, response duration, Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL), and 
safety. 
After the baseline tumor evaluation, tumor assessment during the study will be performed by 
radiological scans every 6 weeks starting from Week 12 until Week 48. At the discretion of 
investigators, patients who remain on study after 48 weeks and are clinically stable may decrease 
imaging frequency to every 12 weeks. Patients will be evaluated for tumor response and patient 
management by sites based on the Immune Related Response Criteria [irRC] (Appendix 6.6 with 
Page 73/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
further details outlined in IIOM) by the investigator with site radiology reading. Copies of tumor images 
will be collected and provided to a central imaging vendor, and subjected to independent central 
review. Independent central review will utilize RECIST 1.1 criteria for response assessment. During the 
course of the study, the Data Monitoring committee (DMC) will monitor all safety information to ensure 
patient safety in accordance with a separate charter. The DMC will also evaluate the data at the 
planned interim analyses and make recommendations of stopping or continuing the study according to 
a separate charter. There are two planned interim efficacy analyses. The primary objective of the first 
interim analysis is to demonstrate clinical benefit in PFS. The study may stop early for futility based on 
PFS and OS at the first interim analysis. The primary objective of the second interim analysis is to 
evaluate treatment effect based on OS. In addition to the IAs, the study will also take into account 
data external to the study from PN001, which also has an ongoing cohort of advanced melanoma 
patients who are being randomized to 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks. As data 
from PN001 may become available prior to the first IA for PN006, if there is sufficient evidence of 
superiority or futility for one of the two dosing regimens of pembrolizumab from data external to the 
study, the SPONSOR may elect to discontinue one of the two pembrolizumab arms in PN006 prior to 
the first interim analysis via a protocol amendment. 
Sample size 
The study will enrol approximately 645 patients randomized to one of two pembrolizumab arms or IPI 
in a 1:1:1 ratio, stratified by line of therapy, PD-L1 expression and ECOG performance status. The 
sample size was based on a target of 435 OS events among the two pembrolizumab arms and IPI arm 
at the final analysis of OS. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized 1:1:1 to IPI (3 mg/kg every 3 weeks for 4 doses), pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks for up to 2 years, or pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks for up to 2 years. The 
study was stratified by line of therapy (1st vs. 2nd), PD-L1 status (high positive vs. low positive) and 
ECOG (0 vs. 1). 
Blinding (masking) 
This study was designed as an open label study. 
Statistical methods 
The study is considered to be positive if at least one pembrolizumab arm is superior to IPI in PFS at an 
interim analysis OR at least one pembrolizumab arm is superior to IPI in OS at either an interim 
analysis or the final analysis of OS. 
The data cutoff date for IA1 was 03SEP2014, driven by the fact that all patients have had at least 6 
months of follow-up, which was deemed important for unbiased estimation of PFS effect based on data 
from PN001. The over enrollment and the requirement of a minimum of 6 months follow-up for all 
patients led to the actual number of PFS events of 489 based on IRO assessments at IA1. 
The overall type I error rate for this study was controlled at 2.5% (one-sided) with 0.5% allocated to 
PFS and 2.0% allocated to the overall OS hypothesis. The study is consider to be positive if at least 
one pembrolizumab arm is superior to IPI in PFS at an interim analysis OR at least one pembrolizumab 
arm is superior to IPI in OS at either an interim analysis or the final analysis of OS. 
Page 74/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
IA2  was  planned  to  take  place  when  minimum  follow-up  is  at  least  9  months  and  approximately  290 
deaths have been observed, unless it takes longer than 12 months of follow-up to observe 290 deaths, 
in  which  case  the  analysis  would  be  performed  when  the  minimum  follow-up  is  12  months.  The  data 
cutoff  date  for  IA2  was  03-Mar-2015,  driven  by  the  minimum  follow-up  of  12  months.  The  total 
number of deaths is 289. The median OS follow-up is 13.8 months. OS was tested at the alpha level of 
0.005 using the Hochberg step-up procedure at IA2 . Using the Hochberg procedure, if the p-value for 
both pembrolizumab arms is <0.005, both pembrolizumab arms are superior to IPI arm in  OS; if the 
least  significant  (larger)  p-value  is  >0.005  then  the  most  significant  (smaller)  p-value  needs  to  be 
compared with 0.0025 (0.005/2). 
Results 
Recruitment 
Enrollment of PN006 was completed in 6 months on 03MAR2014 with a total of 834 patients 
randomized, which is 29% over the target enrollment of 645 patients. 
Conduct of the study 
In order to best evaluate the overall survival objective of this study, patients who progress during the 
study will not be allowed to cross-over from one arm to the other as part of study therapy, and 
patients who progress on the IPI arm will be excluded from participation in other pembrolizumab trials 
unless the DMC or the SPONSOR determine that the study has achieved its efficacy objective(s). 
Following the results from the IA1, the DMC recommended unblinding the study internally to facilitate 
regulatory filing while continuing study follow-up.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint for IA1: PFS based on IRO review per RECIST 1.1 
Both pembrolizumab arms met the pre-specified criteria for a positive PFS outcome at the first interim 
analysis, with a HR of 0.58 for both treatment arms (individually) compared to IPI ( one-sided p-value 
<0.00001 in both comparisons, favoring pembrolizumab) (Table 38 and Figure 25).

Figure 25: 
K-M of progression free survival based on IRO assessment (primary censoring 
rule) (ITT ppulation) 
The primary PFS analysis was based on independent central review, applying RECIST 1.1. A supportive 
analysis based on investigator disease assessments, applying irRC criteria showed very similar results 
(HR  0.56  in  both  individual  pembrolizumab  arms  over  the  control,  one-sided  p-value  <0.00001).The 
median  PFS  is  7.0  months  in  pembrolizumab  10  mg/kg  Q2W  arm,  7.2  months  in  the  pembrolizumab 
10 mg/kg Q3W arm, and 3.3 months in the control arm. Six-month PFS rates are 55% for both of the 
pembrolizumab arms compared to 34% for the IPI arm. 
Primary endpoint for IA2: OS 
The  primary  objective  of  the  planned  second  interim  analysis  (IA2)  was  to  evaluate  treatment  effect 
based on OS. The total number of deaths is 289. The median OS follow-up is 13.8 months.

Secondary endpoint: Overall response 
The ORR is 33.7% in the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q2W arm, 32.9% in the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg 
Q3W arm, and 11.9% in the control arm based on independent radiologist plus oncologist review. 
Since most of the responses are ongoing in each arm the median DoR has not been reached.

A supplemental subgroup analysis based on BRAF mutation status from Study P006 was submitted. 
Since in this study patients with BRAF V600E mutant melanoma may or may not have received a prior 
BRAF inhibitor, depending on the baseline presence/absence of elevated LDH, clinically significant 
tumour related symptoms or rapidly progressing disease in the judgment of the investigator, patients 
who had BRAF mutant tumours and were BRAF inhibitor naive had more favourable disease 
characteristics than the other subgroups. In contrast, patients with BRAF mutant tumours who had 
received prior BRAF inhibitor had the worst baseline characteristics.

The subgroup analysis based on BRAF status shows a substantial benefit in terms of PFS, OS and ORR 
in all subgroups, with an effect slightly less evident in patients with BRAF mutant tumours who had 
received prior BRAF inhibitor.

Clinical studies in special populations 
No dedicated studies in special population have been conducted. 
Overall,  492  ≥65  years  patients  (41%)  have  been  included  in  the  studies  P001  and  P002.  More than 
10% of patients enrolled were ≥75 years old. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Various pooled analyses across cohorts with all patients combined or segregated by prior ipilimumab 
exposure were performed. 
An  integrated  efficacy  analysis  of  study  P001  Part  B2  and  study  P002  have  been  conducted, 
considering  the  similar  patients  population  (IPI-refractory  melanoma  patients)  and  the  same 
pembrolizumab  regimens  compared.  In  both  studies,  patients  were  required  to  have  confirmed  PD  in 
the  absence  of  rapid  clinical  progression,  with  progression  first  documented  within  6  months  (24 
weeks)  of  the  last  dose  of  IPI  (minimum  of  2  doses).  In  addition,  subjects  with  BRAF  V600  mutant 
melanoma  must  have  had  a  prior  treatment  regimen  that  includes  vemurafenib,  dabrafenib,  or  other 
approved BRAF and/or MEK inhibitors. Both Part B2 of P001 and P002 compared 2 mg/kg Q3W and 10 
mg/kg Q3W in a randomized fashion. 
The overall efficacy profile is consistent between the two trials:

Confirmed responses (CR + PR) were reported in 22% (95% CI: 18-28%) of patients who were treated 
at  2  mg/kg  Q3W  compared  to  25%  (95%  CI:  20-31%)  of  subjects  who  were  treated  at  10  mg/kg 
Q3W, including complete responses in 3% (95% CI: 1-5%) and 4% (95% CI: 2-7%) at 2 mg/kg Q3W 
and  10  mg/kg  Q3W,  respectively.  In  both  treatment  arms,  approximately  43%  of  patients  achieved 
disease control. 
The median response duration has not been reached at the time of the analysis and ranged from 5+ to 
62+ weeks. 
At the time of this analysis, 70% of the subjects in the 2 mg/kg Q3W cohort and 69% of the subjects 
in  the  10  mg/kg  Q3W  cohort  had  a  PFS  event  (progression  by  independent  central  review  or  death). 
The median PFS was 3 months for both the 2 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q3W treatment groups. The 
6-month  progression-free  rate  was  37%  for  both  the  2  mg/kg  Q3W  group  and  the  10  mg/kg  Q3W 
group. 
The median OS was not reached for the 2 mg/kg Q3W group and was 18.3 months for the 10 mg/kg 
Q3W group and the lower bound of the 95% CI was 10.9 and 11.5 for the 2 mg/kg Q3W group and the 
10 mg/kg Q3W group, respectively, and the upper bound of the CI was not estimable for either group. 
The  OS  rate  at  6  months  was  comparable  in  both  treatment  groups  with  75%  for  subjects  treated  2 
mg/kg Q2W and 76% for subjects treated 10 mg/kg Q3W. The 12-month OS rate was comparable for 
the 2 dose groups, with 53% alive in the 2 mg/kg Q2W group vs. 56% alive in for the 10 mg/kg Q3W 
group. 
Analysis of PD-L1 Immunohistochemistry in melanoma patients from P001 (Parts B1+B2+D) 
The  relationship  between  tumour  PD-L1  expression  via  immunohistochemistry  (IHC)  and  the  anti-
tumour activity of pembrolizumab was evaluated to examine the potential usefulness of this assay to 
identify patients responsive to pembrolizumab treatment.  
PD-L1  expression  was  scored  by  board-certified  pathologists.  The  Allred  Proportion  Score  (APS)  was 
chosen because it is basic (a six-point scale), it is familiar to pathologists, and has been shown to be a 
highly reproducible method of scoring hormone receptors in breast cancer. The scoring method for PD-
L1 omits an intensity score for simplicity. The cut-off of APS=2 was selected. The proposed cut-off of 
APS=2 was associated with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 49.4% and a negative predictive value 
(NPV) of 86.7%. 
The following table displays the breakdown of confirmed responses by APS score: 
PD-L1 Subgroup Analysis (Positive vs. Negative) 
Page 91/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Across  the  534  IPI-refractory  subjects  in  P001  and  P002  combined  who  were  treated  with 
pembrolizumab,  410  (77%)  subjects  were  evaluable  for  PD-L1  expression,  including  295  (72%) 
subjects  PD-L1  positive  and  115  (28%)  subjects  are  PD-L1  negative  as  defined  by  the  assay  and 
scoring methods used for these studies. 
The  ORR  was  24%  (95%  CI:  20-28%)  in  the  410  PD-L1  evaluable  subjects,  slightly  higher  in  PD-L1 
positive subjects (28%, 95% CI: 23-33%), whereas was lower in PD-L1 negative patients (13%, 95% 
CI  8-21%).  In  responding  subjects,  the  median  duration  of  response  was  not  reached,  regardless  of 
PD-L1 status, and 91% (PD-L1 positive) to 80% (PD-L1 negative) were non-progressing at the time of 
the  analysis.  The  median  PFS  was  4.2  months  in  PD-L1  positive  and  2.8  months  in  PD-L1  negative 
patients.  In  PD-L1  negative  patients,  the  6-month  and  12  month  PFS  rate  was  25%  and  14%, 
respectively. Median OS is currently 18.5 months for PD-L1 positive and approximately 11 months for 
PD-L1 negative patients.

Study P001: “Phase I study of single agent MK-3475 in patients with 
progressive locally advanced or metastatic carcinoma, melanoma, and Non-
Small Cell Lung Carcinoma” 
Study P001 was a multi-center, open-label, first in human Phase 1 trial in subjects with locally 
advanced or metastatic melanoma, NSCLC, or advanced solid tumor. The trial was initially designed as 
a standard dose escalation study, now called Part A, in which several melanoma patients were enrolled 
and had objective responses. Therefore, the study was expanded to evaluate efficacy in melanoma in 
Part B (now Part B1). Through a series of amendments, P001 evolved into 4 Phase 2-like melanoma 
sub-studies, known as Parts B1, B2, B3, and D. In addition, study P001 was further expanded in Parts 
C and F to evaluate the activity of pembrolizumab in NSCLC.

All cohorts of study P001 are depicted in the following Figure: 
Figure 31: 
Trial Design P001 
Part B1 was the initial evaluation of the efficacy of pembrolizumab in subjects with advanced 
melanoma, including subjects who were naïve to IPI or who had been previously treated with IPI. In 
Cohort B2, eligibility criteria required the enrolment of patient that were refractory ipilimumab 
(progression documented in two separate assessment and following at least 2 doses of IPI at a 
minimum dose of 3 mg/kg and within 6 months of the last dose of IPI) and excluded patients that were 
potentially delayed IPI responders. Furthermore, patients with known BRAF V600E mutations were 
required to have received a prior BRAF and/or MEK inhibitor, and could have received an unlimited 
number of prior therapies. Part B3 enrolled both IPI-naïve and IPI-exposed (treated or refractory) 
patients. Eligibility criteria in part D allowed the enrolment of IPI-naïve patients that may have 
received up to 2 prior lines of treatment. Of note, patients with known BRAF V600E mutation may or 
may have not received prior treatment with BRAF/MEK inhibitors. 
Across the cohorts, pembrolizumab has been administered at 3 different dosing regimens: 2 mg/kg 
Q3W or 10 mg/kg Q2W or Q3W in Part B1; 2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks in both Cohorts B2 
and D; 10 mg/kg Q2W or 10 mg/kg Q3W in Part B3. 
The correlation of the extent of tumour response with the degree of biomarker positivity in IPI-naïve 
patients treated with pembrolizumab, and the anti-tumour activity per RECIST 1.1 of pembrolizumab in 
IPI-refractory melanoma patients both unselected and with PD-L1 expressing tumours were also 
considered for evaluation. 
Baseline characteristics 
Part B1 (IPI-naïve and IPI-treated) 
Hundred-thirty  five  patients  (IPI-naïve  and  IPI-treated)  were  enrolled  in  Part  B1  (22  patients  at  2 
mg/kg  Q3W,  56  patients  at  10  mg/kg  Q3W,  and  57  patients  at  10  mg/kg  Q2W).  In  the  total  B1

population, 59% of patients were male and 46% were ≥65 years old. All but 2 patients were white and 
73%  of  patients  were  ECOG  PS  0.  A  majority  of  the  patients  had  had  no  history  of  brain  metastasis 
(92%)  and  22%  harbored  BRAF  V600  mutations.  69%  of  patients  had  elevated  baseline  lactate 
dehydrogenase (LDH) and in 72% the stage of disease was M1c. In addition, 50 patients had at least 2 
prior  systemic  therapies.  In  the  total  population,  27%  had  been  previously  treated  with  an 
immunotherapy (excluding IPI), 34% had previously received chemotherapy, and only 10% had been 
previously  treated  with  a  BRAF/MEK  inhibitor  (vemurafenib,  dabrafenib,  or  trametinib).  There  was  no 
notable difference in prior therapy between arms. 
Part B2 (IPI-Refractory) 
Hundred-seventy three IPI-refractory patients were randomized in this Cohort (89 subjects at 2 mg/kg 
Q3W and 84 subjects at 10 mg/kg Q3W). In this Part, 60% of subjects were male and 36% were 65 
years  old  or  older.  All  but  5  subjects  were  white,  and  67%  of  patients  were  ECOG  PS  0.  Most  of 
patients had no history of brain metastasis (91%) and 17% harbored BRAF V600 mutations. Subjects 
in Part B2 had significant tumor burden at baseline evidenced by 42% with elevated baseline LDH and 
82%  with  stage  M1c  melanoma.  Approximately  73%  (126/173)  of  subjects  had  at  least  2  prior 
systemic  therapies;  32%  had  been  previously  treated  with  an  immunotherapy  (excluding  IPI),  47% 
had  previously  received  chemotherapy,  and  the  remainder  (21%)  had  other  (unclassified)  therapy.  A 
previous treatment with a BRAF/MEK inhibitor is registered in around 20%.  
Part B3 (IPI-naïve and IPI-exposed) 
Two-hundred forty four patients (IPI-naïve and IPI-exposed) enrolled (121 patients at 10 mg/kg Q3W 
and  123  patients  at  10  mg/kg  Q2W).In  this  Cohort,  65% of  subjects  were  male,  and  40%  were  ≥65 
years  old.  All  but 8  subjects  were  white  and 59%  of  subjects  were  ECOG  PS  0.  In  this  Part,  nearly  a 
quarter  of  the  subjects  (24%)  harbored  BRAF  V600  mutations,  41 %  had  elevated  baseline  LDH  and 
80% stage M1c melanoma. In addition, 91% of subjects had no history of brain metastasis and 93 of 
the 244 subjects (38%) had at least 2 prior systemic therapies. 
There  were  123  subjects  naïve  to  IPI,  while  121  subjects  received  prior  IPI  (IPI-treated  or  IPI-
refractory). In the total population, 25% had been previously treated with an immunotherapy and 28% 
had  previously  received  chemotherapy,  including  18%  previously  treated  with  a  BRAF/MEK  inhibitor. 
The  treatment  arms  were  generally  comparable  although  a  higher  percentage  of  subjects  in  the  10 
mg/kg  Q3W  arm  previously  treated  with  a  BRAF/MEK  inhibitor  (22%  vs  14%).  Overall,  59  (24%) 
subjects  had  BRAF  mutant  melanoma,  and  44  (18%)  were  previously  treated  with  an  approved 
BRAF/MEK inhibitor (vemurafenib, dabrafenib, or trametinib) prior to study entry. 
Part D (IPI-Naïve) 
Hundred-three  IPI-naïve  patients  were  enrolled  (51  patients  at  2  mg/kg  Q3W  and  52  patients  at  10 
mg/kg  Q3W).  In  this  Part  D,  61%  of  subjects  were  male  and  36%  were  ≥65  years  old.  All  but  4 
subjects were white and 85% of subjects were ECOG PS 0. A majority of the patients had no history of 
brain metastasis (93%) and 35% harbored BRAF V600 mutations. Baseline LDH was elevated in 35% 
of  patients  and  stage  M1c  melanoma  was  registered  in  72%.  In  the  total  population,  previous 
treatment was immunotherapy in 20%, chemotherapy in 20%, and BRAF/MEK inhibitor (vemurafenib, 
dabrafenib, or trametinib) in 18%. The treatment arms were generally comparable with regard to prior 
therapy, with the exception of a higher percentage of previously treated subjects in the 2 mg/kg Q3W 
arm (65%) compared to the 10 mg/kg Q3W arm (52%).

The primary efficacy endpoint of this study is ORR by independent central review (IRO) using RECIST 
1.1. The primary method of analysis includes review of images by independent radiologists and review 
of  objective  clinical  data  (e.g.  qualitative  skin  photographs,  biopsy  reports  from  suspicious  lesions  if 
performed)  by  independent  oncologists  when  such  data  were  available,  referred  to  as  the  IRO 
assessment.  In  P001,  subjects  were  managed  by  irRC  based  on  Investigator  assessment,  and 
independent central review was also performed based on irRC. 
The primary analyses are based on the FAS population including all patients who received at least one 
dose  of  study  treatment  and  with  measurable  disease  as  defined  by  independent  central  review. 
Therefore, due to discrepancies between investigator and central reviewers the FAS population did not 
include  all  treated  patients.  The  response  rate  has  also  been  analysed  in  the  APaT  population  (All 
Patients as Treated, consisting in all patients who received at least 1 dose of study treatment). 
A summary of ORR based on different methods of analysis across all doses is shown below:  
Table 50: 
Comparison of Overall Response Rate RECIST 1.1 by IRO vs. irRC by IRO vs. 
INV by irRC (FAS and APaT Population) –  All Dose Levels 
Duration of Objective responses 
The 135 patients in Part B1 were followed for the longest duration of time, having been enrolled 
between 1-Dec-2012 and 6-Sep-2012, and thus had at least 18 months of follow-up data at the time 
of the data cutoff for this analysis (18-Apr-2014). There were 51 patients with a confirmed objective 
response across all dose levels tested, and the median time to response was 13 weeks (range 10-84), 
which coincides primarily with the protocol-determined time of disease response assessment. The 
Page 96/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
median response duration has not been reached for the 2 mg/kg Q3W or 10 mg/kg Q2W cohorts, while 
was 93 weeks for the 10 mg/kg Q3W arm. Response durations ranged from 11+ to 98+ weeks. Among 
the 51 responses, 37 (73%) patients have non-PD by IRO. 
In Part B2, patients were enrolled between 24-Aug-2012 and 5-Apr-2013, and thus had at least 12 
months of follow-up at the time of the analysis. There were a total of 43 confirmed objective 
responses, with duration ranging from 12+ to 62+ weeks at the time of the analysis. The median time 
to response was 12 weeks (range 7-48), which coincides primarily with the protocol-determined time 
of disease response assessment. The median response duration was not reached. Similar duration of 
response was reported with pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg Q3W and pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q3W. Over 
90% of patients (91% for 2 mg/kg Q3W and 90% for 10 mg/kg Q3W) had no disease progression. 
In Part B3 patients were enrolled between 18-Apr-2013 and 13-Sep-2013, and thus had approximately 
6 months of follow-up. The median time to response was 12 weeks (range 11-42). There were 74 
patients with a confirmed objective response across all dose levels tested. The median response 
duration has not been reached for the cohort as a whole (range: 6+ to 36+ weeks), nor for any 
individual pembrolizumab dose. 91% of patients had non-PD by independent central review. 
Patients in Part D were enrolled between 7-Sep-2012 and 11-Jan-2013, and thus had at least 15 
months of follow-up. The median time to response was 12 weeks (range 11-39) and response duration 
ranged from 6+ to 61+ weeks across both arms. 83% of patients had non-PD at the time of the 
analysis. 
Progression Free Survival 
PFS  was  estimated  by  Kaplan-Meier  methodology,  and  the  primary  method  of  analysis  was  based  on 
RECIST 1.1 measurements by IRO assessments in the APaT population. 
In Part B1, the median PFS was 13.6 months for the 2 mg/kg Q3W treatment arm, 5.5 months for the 
10 mg/kg Q3W treatment arm, 8.8 months for 10 mg/kg Q2W treatment arm, and 7.2 months for all 
patients regardless of dose schedule. These results compare with those previously reported in which 
the median PFS was 72 weeks (16.6 months) for the 2 mg/kg Q3W treatment arm, 24 weeks (5.5 
months) for the 10 mg/kg Q3W treatment arm, 50 weeks (11.5 months) for 10 mg/kg Q2W treatment 
arm, and 31 weeks (7.1 months) for all patients in the B1 cohort. 
In Cohort B2, the median PFS was 4.9 months for the 2 mg/kg Q3W treatment arm and 3.2 months for 
the 10 mg/kg Q3W treatment arm (HR 0.90, p=0.6). 
In Part B3, the median PFS was 3.0 months for the 10 mg/kg Q3W and 5.2 months for the 10 mg/kg 
Q2W treatment arm (HR = 1.19, p=0.3). 
In Cohort D, the median PFS was 5.5 months for the 2 mg/kg Q3W and 4.2 months for the 10 mg/kg 
Q3W treatment arm (HR = 0.87, p=0.5). 
A  comparison  of  PFS  as  determined  by  IRO  per  RECIST  1.1  and  IRO  per  irRC  is  displayed  in  the 
following Table 51.

Overall Survival 
Of the 135 patients in the APaT population in Part B1, 47 (35%) were reported to have died at the 
time of the analysis. The median OS was not reached for the entire study population or for any of the 
individual dose levels (95% CI 24.4 to not estimable). The 12-month and 18-month OS rates were 
respectively 81% and 62%.  
In Part B2, there were a total of 70 deaths among 173 patients across both treatment arms. The 
median OS was not reached for the 2 mg/kg Q3W cohort (95% CI was 10.9 to not estimable) and was 
18.3 months for the 10 mg/kg Q3W cohort (95% CI 11.4 to not estimable). There was no significant 
difference in OS between treatment arms (p=0.920). The 12-month OS rate was comparable for the 2 
dose cohorts, with 60% in the 2 mg/kg Q3W arm vs. 62% in the 10 mg/kg Q3W arm. The 18-month 
OS rate was very similar to the 12-month OS rate, with 57% in the 2 mg/kg Q3W vs. 62% in the 10 
mg/kg Q3W arm. 
Of the 244 patients in the APaT population in Part B3, 36 (30%) were reported to have died in the 10 
mg/kg Q3W cohort compared with 42 (34%) in the 10 mg/kg Q2W cohort at the time of the analysis. 
There was no significant difference in OS between treatment arms. The OS rate at 6 months was 75%

for the 10 mg/kg Q3W arm and 77% for the 10 mg/kg Q2W arm. The median OS and the OS rate at 
12 months for both cohorts had not been reached at the time of data cut off. 
In Part D, the median OS was not reached, with no significant difference in OS between treatment 
arms. The 12-month OS rate using the Kaplan-Meier estimate for the 2 dose cohorts was 72% in the 2 
mg/kg Q3W arm and 64% in the 10 mg/kg Q3W arm. The 18-month OS rate was 61% in the 2 mg/kg 
Q3W arm and 55% in the 10 mg/kg Q3W arm. 
The OS analyses are summarized in the table below: 
Table 52: 
Summary of Overall Survival (APaT Population) 
Subgroup analysis in the pooled melanoma population (B1+B2+B3+D) 
Subgroup analyses were performed based on major demographic factors and potentially important 
prognostic factors for patients with advanced melanoma. Analyses of patient cohorts based on dose 
and prior IPI treatment were pre-specified, while other subgroups were not pre-specified, but analyzed 
as post-hoc. 
In the pooled melanoma population, including 655 subjects in the APaT population from Parts B1, B2, 
D, and B3, the ORR is 31% (95% CI 28-35%). No important differences were observed in ORR based 
on the age or gender of patients treated with pembrolizumab. Subjects with ECOG PS 0 versus 1, and 
baseline LDH normal versus elevated had generally similar ORR compared to the overall study 
population. With respect to M-stage, subjects with M1b tumor stage (lung metastases without other 
visceral metastases and with a normal LDH) had a higher ORR than the overall study population (52% 
vs. 31% in the B1/B2/B3/D pooled cohort). Subjects with M1c stage (non-pulmonary visceral 
metastases or elevated LDH) had a similar ORR to the overall population (27% vs 31%) 
The 54 subjects with a history of brain metastases had a similar ORR (33%) compared to subjects 
without brain metastases (31%). 
There were 155 subjects with BRAF mutations in the APaT population, and the ORR was 23% 
compared to 33% in subjects with a wild-type BRAF gene. Among the 110 subjects with reported prior 
treatment with a BRAF/MEK inhibitor, the ORR was 21% (95% CI: 14- 30%) in this subgroup.

Uveal melanoma 
P001 enrolled a total of 20 subjects with uveal melanoma (3 subjects at 2 mg/kg Q3W; 14 subjects at 
10 mg/kg Q3W; and 3 subjects at 10 mg/kg Q2W) across all parts of the study (B1, B2, B3, and D). As 
of  the  18-Apr-2014  cutoff  date,  there  were  no  objective  responses  based  on  IRO  assessment  per 
RECIST  1.1  in  these  20  subjects,  while  there  were  6  subjects  (2  subjects  for  each  dose  cohort)  with 
stable disease as the best response.  
Best overall response based on IRO assessment per RECIST 1.1 for subjects with uveal melanoma in 
P001 is described in the table below.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In order to support the indication for pembrolizumab for the treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable and metastatic melanoma at a dose of 2mg/kg Q3W, the applicant submitted the data 
from an ongoing phase I study P001 cohorts B1, B2, B3 and D, data from a randomised, controlled 
trial of pembrolizumab versus chemotherapy in IPI refractory advance melanoma patients study P002 
and the early results of a randomised, controlled study P006 of pembrolizumab versus ipilimumab in 
IPI naïve patients. To support the first line indication in melanoma patients untreated with ipilumumab, 
data from patients randomised to cohort B1 and B3 which were naïve to ipilumumab as well as 
patients in cohort D and study P006, which recruited patients naïve to ipilimumab were submitted. For 
the support of the last line indication, patients that were previously treated with ipilimumab were 
recruited in cohort B1 (treated with ipilimumab), B2 (refractory to ipilimumab), B3 (treated and/or 
refractory to ipilimumab) as well as patients recruited for study P002 (refractory).. All trials are 
currently still ongoing. 
During the assessment, the CHMP had requested a triggered GCP inspection for study P001, which had 
been subject to eight amendments.  This study was initially submitted as the single pivotal trial to 
support the application in the broad indication and there were concerns identified during the 
assessment in relation to the Clinical Study report (CSR), with apparent inconsistency in the data 
presented in the submission and with that presented in the publication of the results of the trial16 . The 
results of the inspection showed no critical findings and the overall conduct of the trial was found 
acceptable, providing reassurance on the integrity and reliability of the data. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dose rationale 
Alternative schedules (10 mg/kg Q3w and 10 mg/kg Q2W) were evaluated in Study P001, and also in 
the on-going comparative studies P002 (IPI-refractory patients: 2 mg/kg Q3W or 10 mg/kg Q3W) and 
P006 (IPI-naive patients: 10 mg/kg Q3W or 10 mg/kg Q2W). The CHMP was initially concerned that 
the 10 mg/kg dose in study P002 had shown a better efficacy compared with the proposed dose 2 
mg/kg for the indication.  A higher ORR at 10 mg/kg Q2W dose was shown in comparison to other 
doses tested (2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W) in cohort B1 as well. Subsequent investigations and 
analyses across studies presented by the applicant demonstrated that this high response in a single 
group appeared to be a chance event as the totality of the currently available data, including 
randomized cohort comparisons, was consistent with a lack of statistically significant and clinically 
meaningful differences in response across these doses and regimens.  Exposure-response analyses at 
the individual trial level revealed that no clinically relevant exposure-response relationship was 
observed. Further analyses with an integrated exposure-response analysis for clinical efficacy, 
including all melanoma studies (P001, P002 and P006) showed a non- significant relationship between

20;384(9948):1109-17.

pembrolizumab exposure and change in tumour size, which was slightly more evident in IPI-naïve 
patients. Box plots representing the 25th-75th percentile spread of change in tumour showed an overlap 
between the boxes at the different exposure level, with no apparent exposure-response relationship. 
No differences were seen across the wide range of exposures (<660 µg/ml to >8010 µg/ml) and doses 
(1 to 10 mg/kg). Based on these analyses, the CHMP is reassured that the extrapolation of the data 
shown in the trial P006 with the dose 10 mg/kg can be considered applicable for the 2mg/kg and that 
no differences in the efficacy are to be expected between the two doses.  
Efficacy 
Treatment of ipilimumab naïve patients 
The use of pembrolizumab in IPI-naive patients was supported by Study P001, part D and preliminary 
data from Study P006. 
Study P001, Part D, enrolled a patient population with similar characteristics of Study P006.  
In study P001, around 35% of confirmed responses were reported in IPI-naive patients (37% and 35% 
in FAS and APaT population, respectively); an ORR of 33.3 has been reported at the proposed 
recommended dose of 2 mg/kg Q3W (see section 5.1 of the SmPC); overall, approximately half of the 
IPI-naïve patients achieved disease control as the best response (52.2% and 53.4% in FAS and APaT 
population, respectively). As for IPI-refractory patients, data on the duration of stable disease were 
reported showing an overall median duration of stable disease of 36 weeks (48.1 and 25.9 weeks for 2 
mg/kg and 10 mg/kg arm, respectively), and the median duration of response was not reached 
Study P006 enrolled patients with or without BRAF V600E mutant melanoma. Patients may have 
received a prior BRAF inhibitor, but it was not required if patients had normal LDH, no clinically 
significant tumour related symptoms and absence of rapidly progressing disease. All patients were 
required to submit a tumour tissue sample for PD-L1 expression evaluation. Patients were randomized 
1:1:1 to one of the two pembrolizumab arms or IPI, and were stratified according to PD-L1 expression 
and ECOG PS. Cross-over was not allowed in order to avoid confoundment of OS results. 
Overall baseline characteristics were well balanced in the three arms. Almost all patients (97.8%) were 
of white race. Around 60% of patients were male, and there was a slight prevalence of patients < 65 
years old (56.5%). Over 65.3% of patients had stage M1c, and about 68% of patients had received no 
prior systemic therapies lines of treatment for advanced disease. The prevalence of BRAF mutation was 
higher than in study P002 and P001, with 36.2% of subjects with BRAF mutant tumours, and 18.1% of 
subjects had received prior BRAF inhibitor; PD-L1 status was missing in a slight minority of patients 
(1.6%), while 80.5 of patients had PD-L1 positive staining tumours.  
The IA1 part of Study P006 was performed at the pre-specified 0.002 alpha level for each 
pembrolizumab arm compared to the ipilimumab arm. Based on a total of 502 events, with a minimum 
of 6-month follow-up, the HR is 0.58 for both pembrolizumab arms over IPI. The median PFS is 5.5 
months in the pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q2W arm, 4.1 months in the 10 mg/kg Q3W arm, and 2.8 
months in the control arm. The 6 month PFS rate is 47.3% (95% CI; 41.2%, 53.2%) in the 
pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q2W arm and 46.4% (95% CI; 40.3%, 52.3%) in the pembrolizumab 10 
mg/kg Q3W arm, compared to 26.5% (95% CI; 20.9%, 32.4%) in the control arm.   
The subgroup analyses for PFS show a consistent effect in all subgroups, at each pembrolizumab dose 
level. 
The data cut-off date for IA2 was 03-mar-2015, and is based on a total of 289 OS events (66% of the 
435 target events at the final analysis) with a minimum follow-up of 12 months and a median follow-
Page 104/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
up of 13.8 months. OS was tested at the alpha level of 0.005. The hazard ratio for OS is 0.63 
(p=0.00052) for pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q2W over the control arm and 0.69 (p=0.00358 ) for 
pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q3W over the control arm, respectively, with no difference between the two 
pembrolizumab arms compared to each other (HR 0.91, p=0.51319) (see section 5.1 of the SmPC). 
The median OS has not yet been reached in all three arms, and the 12-month OS rates are 74.1% 
(95% CI: 68.5%, 78.9%) and 68.4% (95% CI: 62.5%, 73.6%) for pembrolizumab at Q2W and Q3W, 
respectively, compared to 58.2% (95% CI: 51.8%, 64.0%) in the control arm. 
Overall, the provided results of Study P006 confirm preliminary observations from Study P001, Part D, 
and show a clinically meaningful advantage of pembrolizumab over ipilimumab in IPI-naive patients 
with unresectable advanced melanoma and support the proposed indication which includes patients 
that have not been treated with ipilimumab.  
Treatment of ipilimumab refractory patients 
Data on the use of pembrolizumab in IPI-refractory patients were based on the results of Study P002 
and supported by Study P001, part B2. 
Overall baseline characteristics were well balanced in the three arms. The prevalence of BRAF mutation 
was less than expected in unselected population, with 23.1% of subjects with BRAF mutant tumours. 
PD-L1 status was undetermined in 22% of patients, and 53.9% of patients had PD-L1 positive 
tumours.  
Study P001, Part B2, enrolled a patient population with similar characteristics.  
Results from IA2 of Study P002 showed a substantial benefit from the treatment with pembrolizumab 
compared to chemotherapy, with a PFS HR of 0.57 (95% CI: 0.45, 0.73) and 0.50 (95% CI: 0.39, 
0.64) in the 2 mg/kg Q3W arm and the 10 mg/kg Q3W arm, respectively, versus the chemotherapy 
arm (see section 5.1 of the SmPC).  
Overall, no clinically or statistically significant difference was observed between the 2 pembrolizumab 
doses, even though a trend towards better efficacy was reported with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg. 
Subgroups analyses showed a consistent effect in all subgroups. At the time of this interim analysis, 86 
(48%) chemotherapy subjects had crossed over to the pembrolizumab treatment arm (2 or 10 mg/kg 
Q3W) confounding the OS results. Therefore, no conclusion can be drawn on the OS at this stage. 
The ORR observed in study P002 is comparable to that observed in Study P001, including a similar 
patient population. The median time to response was similar for pembrolizumab and chemotherapy 
and was consistent with the first scheduled tumour assessment. Interestingly, responses occurred up 
to 30 weeks in both the 2 mg/kg Q3W arm and 10 mg/kg Q3W pembrolizumab arm, and only up to 18 
weeks in the control arm. Median response duration was not reached in either of pembrolizumab arms, 
while been 37 weeks in the control arm. 
P001 enrolled a total of 20 subjects with uveal melanoma. The sample size was too small to draw any 
conclusions. The information on limited available data in patients with ocular melanoma is reported in 
the SmPC section 5.1.  
Overall, results from the randomized phase 2 Study P002, IA2, confirmed the benefit observed in 
Study P001 Part B2 in the IPI-refractory population, and demonstrated a substantial advantage of 
pembrolizumab over chemotherapy, supporting the proposed indication which includes patients that 
have been previously treated with ipilimumab (see section 5.1 of the SmPC).  
Patients with tumours designated as PD-L1 positive and BRAF V600 mutation positive 
Page 105/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The benefits observed in the overall patient population in studies P001, P002 and P006 appear to be 
consistent across all subgroups analysed, although in some cases it appears more limited in the PD-L1 
negative subset. For study P006, it is acknowledged that the study was not sufficiently powered for 
subgroup analyses, and that confidence intervals are quite large and overlapping, due to the relatively 
small sample size. The CHMP was concerned over the substantial higher rate of events observed in the 
PD-L1 negative subset relative to the PD-L1 positive subgroup for both PFS (70.6 vs 60.7% patients 
with a PFS event in the PD-L1 negative and PD-L1 positive subgroups, respectively) and OS (45.6% vs 
34% of patients with an OS event in the PD-L1 negative and PD-L1 positive subgroups, respectively). 
However, the integrated exposure-response analysis provided by the applicant showed a similar lack of 
exposure-efficacy correlation with PD-L1 expression status as well as for patients with BRAF V600 
mutated tumours. These results provided reassurance to the CHMP that no differences in efficacy are 
to be expected for patients that have tumours designated as PD-L1 negative and for patients that 
harbour the BRAF V600 mutation. In order to further support the analysis of the data provided in the 
application and strengthen interpretation of data which is hampered by the scarse number of patients 
in these subgroups, the CHMP has imposed a post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES) to have the 
updated efficacy data from the P002 final analysis and from Parts B2 and D of P001 (data cut-off 
date:18-Oct-2014) by dose level based on BRAF mutation and PD-L1 expression status as these 
uncertainties with respect to the efficacy of a medicinal product in the sub-populations could not be 
resolved prior to marketing authorisation and require further clinical evidence. 
BRAF mutation status 
A subgroup analysis of KEYNOTE-002 in patients who were BRAF wild type (n=415; 77%) or BRAF 
mutant with prior BRAF treatment (n=125; 23%) was performed. The PFS HRs (pooled pembrolizumab 
[2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks] vs. chemotherapy) were 0.51 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.65) for BRAF 
wild type and 0.56 (95% CI: 0.37, 0.85) for BRAF mutant with prior BRAF treatment. The PFS HRs for 
pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks vs. chemotherapy were 0.51 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.67) for BRAF 
wild type and 0.74 (95% CI: 0.46, 1.18) for BRAF mutant with prior BRAF treatment. The OS HRs for 
pooled pembrolizumab vs. chemotherapy were 0.83 (95% CI: 0.60, 1.15) for BRAF wild type and 
0.82 (95% CI: 0.47, 1.43) for BRAF mutant with prior BRAF treatment. The OS HRs for pembrolizumab 
2 mg/kg every 3 weeks vs. chemotherapy were 0.80 (95% CI: 0.55, 1.18) for BRAF wild type and 1.03 
(95% CI: 0.55, 1.91) for BRAF mutant with prior BRAF treatment. ORR for pooled pembrolizumab and 
pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks vs. chemotherapy was 27% and 25% vs. 6% for BRAF wild 
type and 12% and 9% vs. 0% for BRAF mutant with prior BRAF treatment.  
A subgroup analysis of KEYNOTE-006 in patients who were BRAF wild type (n=525; 63%), BRAF

(n=139; 17%) was performed. The PFS hazard ratios (HRs) (pooled pembrolizumab [10 mg/kg every 
2 or 3 weeks] vs. ipilimumab) were 0.57 (95% CI: 0.45, 0.73) for BRAF wild type, 0.50 (95% CI: 
0.32, 0.77) for BRAF mutant without prior BRAF treatment, and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.48, 1.11) for BRAF 
mutant with prior BRAF treatment. The OS HRs for pooled pembrolizumab vs. ipilimumab were 
0.61 (95% CI: 0.46, 0.82) for BRAF wild type, 0.69 (95% CI: 0.33, 1.45) for BRAF mutant without 
prior BRAF treatment, and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.45, 1.26) for BRAF mutant with prior BRAF treatment. ORR 
for pooled pembrolizumab vs. ipilimumab was 34% vs. 13% for BRAF wild type, 41% vs. 13% for 
BRAF mutant without prior BRAF treatment, and 21% vs. 6% for BRAF mutant with prior BRAF 
treatment.

A subgroup analysis of KEYNOTE-002 in patients who were PD-L1 positive (Allred proportion score of 
≥2 representing PD-L1 membrane expression in ≥1% of tumour cells) vs. PD-L1 negative (Allred 
proportion score of 0 or 1) was performed. PD-L1 expression was tested retrospectively by 
immunohistochemistry research assay with the 22C3 anti-PD-L1 antibody. Among patients who were 
evaluable for PD-L1 expression (78%), 69% (n=291) were PD-L1 positive and 31% (n=130) were 
PD-L1 negative. The PFS HRs (pooled pembrolizumab [2 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg every 3 weeks] vs. 
chemotherapy) were 0.52 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.68) for PD-L1 positive patients and 0.60 (95% CI: 0.38, 
0.94) for PD-L1 negative patients. The PFS HRs for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks vs. 
chemotherapy were 0.54 (95% CI: 0.39, 0.75) for PD-L1 positive patients and 0.89 (95% CI: 0.53, 
1.50) for PD-L1 negative patients. The OS HRs for pooled pembrolizumab vs. chemotherapy were 
0.82 (95% CI: 0.55, 1.23) for PD-L1 positive patients and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.43, 1.37) for PD-L1 
negative patients. The OS HRs for pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks vs. chemotherapy were 
0.93 (95% CI: 0.58, 1.49) for PD-L1 positive patients and 1.19 (95% CI: 0.58, 2.46) for PD-L1 
negative patients. ORR for pooled pembrolizumab and pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks vs. 
chemotherapy was 26% and 23% vs. 4% for PD-L1 positive patients and 15% and 11% vs. 8% for 
PD-L1 negative patients.  
A subgroup analysis of KEYNOTE-006 in patients who were PD-L1 positive (n=671; 80%) vs. PD-L1 
negative (n=150; 18%) was performed. Among patients who were evaluable for PD-L1 expression 
(98%), 82% were PD-L1 positive and 18% were PD-L1 negative. The PFS HRs (pooled pembrolizumab 
[10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks] vs. ipilimumab) were 0.53 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.65) for PD-L1 positive 
patients and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.47, 1.11) for PD-L1 negative patients. The OS HRs for pooled 
pembrolizumab vs. ipilimumab were 0.56 (95% CI: 0.43, 0.73) for PD-L1 positive patients and 
0.95 (95% CI: 0.56, 1.62) for PD-L1 negative patients. The ORRs for the pooled pembrolizumab vs. 
ipilimumab group were 37% vs. 12% for PD-L1 positive patients and 18% vs. 11% for PD-L1 negative 
patients. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
pembrolizumab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of all conditions 
included in the category of malignant neoplasms (except nervous system, haematopoietic and 
lymphoid tissue) (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In conclusion, the overall data support the efficacy of pembrolizumab as monotherapy in both patients 
that are naïve to ipilimumab treatment and patients that have been previously treated with ipilimumab 
in melanoma patients with advanced disease. The comparative studies P002 and P006 are still ongoing 
and only interim results have been submitted. Therefore, the CHMP has imposed two PAES to have the 
final study reports for studies P002 and P006.  
The proposed dose of 2 mg/kg Q3W is considered sufficiently justified for the overall population and it 
is agreed that there is no significant differences between the 2 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q3W dose 
levels in the overall population. A similar conclusion can also be drawn for subgroups of patients that 
have tumours which harbour the BRAF V600 mutation and for the subset of patients that have tumours 
which have been designated as PD-L1 negative.  However, the evidence is based on data that is 
considered limited. The CHMP is of the opinion that the relevance of PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression as 
biomarkers, in the tumour microenvironment as well as in the peripheral compartment, should be 
further explored. Therefore, the CHMP has imposed a PAES to have updated efficacy data from the 
Page 107/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
P002 final analysis and from P001 for Parts B2 and D of P001 by dose level in subgroups based on 
BRAF mutation status and PD-L1 expression status as an Annex II condition.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to be addressed as related to some aspects of 
efficacy of the medicinal product were identified and can be resolved only after the medicinal product 
has been marketed: 
• 
• 
• 
Post-authorisation  efficacy  study  (PAES):  The  MAH  should  submit  the  final  study  report  for 
study  P002:  Randomized,  Phase  II  Study  of  MK-3475  versus  Chemotherapy  in  Patients  with 
Advanced Melanoma – Final Study Report 
Post-authorisation  efficacy  study  (PAES):  The  MAH  should  submit  the  final  study  report  for 
study  P006:  A  Multicenter,  Randomized,  Controlled,  Three-Arm,  Phase  III  Study  to  Evaluate 
the  Safety  and  Efficacy  of  Two  Dosing  Schedules  of  MK-3475  Compared  to  Ipilimumab  in 
Patients with Advanced Melanoma – Final Study Report 
Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): In order to confirm the benefit in BRAFV600 mutant 
and  in  PD-L1  negative  patient  subgroups  at  the  recommended  dose,  the  MAH  should  provide 
updated analyses from Study P001 and P002: 
o  Updated efficacy data in subgroups comparing 2 vs 10 mg/kg Q3W from the P002 final 
analysis.  
o  Efficacy  data  in  subgroups  comparing  the  2  vs  10  mg/kg  Q3W  from  P001,  using  the 
data cut-off date of 18-Oct-2014 from Parts B2 and D of P001 by dose level.  
• 
The value of biomarkers to predict the efficacy of pembrolizumab should be further explored, 
specifically: 
Although  PD-L1  status  is  predictive  of  response  in  advanced  melanoma  patients,  durable 
responses  have  been  observed  in  PD-L1  negative  patients.  Additional  biomarkers  other  than 
PD-L1 expression status by IHC (e.g. PD-L2, RNA signature, etc.) predictive of pembrolizumab 
efficacy  should  be  investigated  together  with  more  information  regarding  the  pattern  of 
expression of PD-L1 obtained in the ongoing melanoma studies (P001, P002 and P006):  
o  PD-L1 IHC comparison of archival tissue vs newly obtained 
o  PD-L1 IHC comparison between pre and post treatment tumour tissues 
o  Nanostring RNA gene signature 
o  PD-L2 IHC 
o  RNA and proteomic serum profiling 
o 
Immune cell profiling (peripheral blood)

Drug exposure of IPI-naïve melanoma patients of study P006, at the first interim analysis, is reported 
in the following table: 
Table 56: 
Summary of Drug Exposure P006 (APaT Population) 
Adverse events 
Overall, the safety profile for pembrolizumab is similar between all three dose groups, with only a few 
AEs (fatigue, headache, diarrhoea, and nausea) with incidence greater (>10% difference) in the 10 
mg/kg Q2W group versus the 2 mg/kg Q3W group. Among all subjects, the SOCs in which ≥ 50% of 
events were reported included: Gastrointestinal disorders (66.3%), General disorders (72.4%), 
Page 109/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (55.2%), and Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
(57.6%) (Table 57).

groups) –Pooled Studies P001 and P002 (APaT population) 
Page 111/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The overall incidences of Grade 3-5 AEs across the 3 groups was 43.5%, 41.9%, and 45.0%, in the 2 
mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W, and 10 mg/kg Q2W groups respectively. The incidence of Grade 3-5 AEs 
was occurring in more than 7.1% (anaemia in 2 mg/kg Q3W) of subjects in any treatment group. The 
most commonly reported Grade 3-5 AEs, occurring in at least 2% of subjects in this pooled melanoma 
population were: anaemia (4.6%), hyponatraemia (3.0%), fatigue (2.6%), and dyspnoea (2.4%). In 
the pooled analysis, Grade 3-5 AEs did not appear to cluster in any particular SOC (incidence in any 
SOC was not >10%), with the biggest difference seen in the Metabolism SOC (9.4% in 2 mg/kg Q3W, 
6.3% in 10 mg/kg Q3W, and 11.7% in 10 mg/kg Q2W).

Table 58 displays the number and percentage of subjects with ADRs (incidence >0% in one or more 
treatment groups) in the pooled melanoma population of P001 + P002. Drug-related AEs were 
reported for 798 of 1012 (78.9%) subjects in this pooled melanoma population. The most frequently 
reported drug-related AEs, reported for at least 10% of subjects in the pooled melanoma population, 
were: fatigue (33.3%), pruritus (23.8%), rash (16.9%), diarrhoea (14.7%), arthralgia (13.0%), and 
nausea (12.0%).

Overall, drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs were reported for 137 of 1012 subjects (13.5%). The most 
frequently reported drug-related Grade 3-5 AE was fatigue, reported for 15 subjects (1.5%). Aside 
from fatigue, the only drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs, reported in more than 5 subjects (0.5%), were: 
diarrhoea (0.8%), colitis (0.7%), asthenia (0.6%), anaemia (0.5%), dyspnoea (0.5%), and vomiting 
(0.5%). 
Early  safety  results  from  study  P006  for  those  AEs  which  were  prespecified  in  the  protocol  to  be 
compared  between  treatment  arms  with  p-values  are  summarized  in  the  following  Table  59.  The 
comparison was performed using a stratified Miettinen & Nurminen method.

Table 59: 
P006-Analysis of Adverse Event Summary
 Tier 1 (APaT Population) 
‐
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
SAEs were reported for 377 of 1012 subjects (37.3%). Overall, the incidences were 40.6%, 35.4%, 
and 36.1% in the 2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W, and 10 mg/kg Q2W arms, respectively. The most 
commonly reported SAE overall was pneumonia, which was reported for 23 subjects (2.3%). The only 
other SAE reported in more than 2% of subjects was: dyspnoea, which was reported in 21 subjects 
(2.1%). The SAE profile of pembrolizumab was similar in the 2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W, and 10 
mg/kg Q2W groups, and the incidences of SAEs across SOCs were comparable across the three 
groups. 
Overall, ADR related SAEs were reported for 93 of 1012 subjects (9.2%). By treatment arm, ADR-
related SAEs were reported for 29 of 340 subjects (8.5%) in the 2 mg/kg Q3W group, 42 of 492 
subjects (8.5%) in the 10 mg/kg Q3W group, and 22 of 180 subjects (12.2%) in the 10 mg/kg Q2W

group. ADR-related SAEs did not predominantly occur in any one SOC. With the exception of colitis 
(n=8, 0.8%), pneumonitis (n=8, 0.8%), pyrexia (n=7, 0.7%), and diarrhoea (n=6, 0.6%), no single 
AE was reported as both serious and drug related for more than 5 subjects. The percentage of drug-
related SAEs was numerically higher in the 10 mg/kg Q2W group (12.2%), compared to the 2 mg/kg 
Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q3W groups (8.5% in each group) with the difference spread over small increases 
in individual AEs. 
SAEs occurred in 37.9%, 33.5%, and 35.0% of subjects, and drug-related SAEs occurred in 8.5%, 
7.7%, and 12.2% of subjects in the 2 mg/kg Q3W, 10 mg/kg Q3W, and 10 mg/kg Q2W groups, 
respectively. 
At the proposed regimen of 2 mg/kg Q3W, the estimated mean change in QTc interval at peak 
concentrations is 0.83 msec (upper 90% CI of 0.93 msec), well below 20 msec, the level of concern in 
the setting of advanced cancer. These findings were confirmed based on an analysis of triplicate ECG 
data from Part F of P001, which indicated an estimated mean change in QTc interval at peak 
concentrations of the 2 mg/kg Q3W regimen of 0.91 msec (upper 90% CI of 1.4 msec). 
There were no drug-related deaths in any of the melanoma cohorts in P001. 
In study P002, there were 26 (2.6%) deaths due to AEs, of which all but one was considered by the 
Investigator to be not related to study drug. Deaths were generally similar across treatment arms, 
occurring in 6.2% and in 4.5% of subjects in the 2 mg/kg Q3W and the 10 mg/kg Q3W pembrolizumab 
arms, respectively, versus 4.7% of subjects in the chemotherapy control arm. The one drug-related 
death that occurred in the 2 mg/kg Q3W arm was originally reported by the investigator as drug-
related. However, after the database was locked, the investigator changed the attribution of the death 
to unrelated. Although the cause of death was not clear, the investigator indicated that probable 
causes were disease progression and bleeding from intestinal metastasis. 
In study P006, a total of 44 cases with a fatal outcome were identified, including 40 cases considered 
not related and 4 related to study therapy (IPI or pembrolizumab) by the investigator. There were only 
2 pembrolizumab cases entered as related to pembrolizumab, 1 case reported as related by the 
investigator and 1 reported as unknown. One case was reported as renal failure as related to 
pembrolizumab by the investigator. The other case was likely related to malignant disease progression. 
In study P010, A total of 67 cases with a fatal outcome were identified, including 62 events considered 
by  the  investigator  not  related  and  5  events  related  to  study  therapy  (docetaxel  or  pembrolizumab). 
There were two cases that were related to febrile neutropenia and cardiac failure acute, respectively, 
that occurred while on treatment with docetaxel. The remaining 3 cases that were considered related 
to pembrolizumab by the investigator showed that in one case insufficient information was provided for 
a  complete  medical  assessment,another  case  had  an  alternative  explanation  confounding  causality 
assessment,  such  as,  underlying  malignant  disease  progression  and  the  third  case  related  to 
pneumonitis  in  a  patient  with  NSCLC  in  which  a  causal  association  between  the  fatal  event  and 
pembrolizumab could not be excluded. 
In study P012, a total of 21 fatal cases were identified, including 19 cases considered not related and 2 
cases  related  to  pembrolizumab.  In  one  case,  there  was  insufficient  information  provided  for  a 
complete  medicalassessment.  The  other  case  was  related  to  a  rapid  onset  of  tracheobronchomalacia 
without etiology for which the investigator assessed as related to pembrolizumab. 
Immunogenicity 
Page 130/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A 10 mL sample of blood for anti-pembrolizumab antibodies was collected at specified time points. The 
samples  were  assayed 
for  anti-pembrolizumab  antibodies  presence  using  a  validated 
electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay on the Sector Imager 2400 analyser from MesoScale Discovery 
(MSD).  Samples  were  analysed  for  the  presence  of  anti  pembrolizumab  antibodies  with  further 
characterization of anti-pembrolizumab antibodies and assessment of their neutralizing capacity. 
A validated bridging electrochemiluminescence (ECL) immunoassay was used for the detection of anti-
pembrolizumab antibodies in human serum (see above under section “Analytical methods”). 
Overall, 2063 samples from 480 subjects from study parts A, B, C and D were available. A subset of 31 
patients  was  not  evaluable  for  drug-induced  immunogenicity,  because  only  a  pre-treatment  ADA 
sample  was  available.  The  remaining  449  patients  were  evaluable  for  immunogenicity  (all  2063 
samples were tested in the ADA screening assay). 
Interference  by  pembrolizumab  in  the  ADA  assays  may  occur,  especially  at  concentrations  above  the 
drug  tolerance  level  of  25  μg/mL.  Therefore,  samples  with  a  negative  test  result  in  the  screening  or 
confirmatory  anti-MK3475  assay  could  only  be  confirmed  to  be  negative  in  the  case  of  an 
pembrolizumab  concentration  below25  μg/mL.  The  immunogenicity  status  of  a  patient  could  only  be 
confirmed to be negative if all pre-treatment and post-dose samples were negative in the confirmatory 
assay for antibodies against pembrolizumab and if the concentration of pembrolizumab in the last post-
dose sample was below the drug tolerance level. 
The following table presents the immunogenicity status of all 449 evaluable patients (with at least one 
post-dose ADA sample): 
Page 131/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 60: 
Summary of immunogenicity results 
Two patients had one sample each that tested positive in the tier 2 confirmatory assay for antibodies 
against pembrolizumab: 
For patient AN 0263, the pre-treatment sample was found to be positive. This sample was negative in 
the confirmatory NAb assay. Post-dose samples were negative in the screening assay at Day 21 (Cycle 
2) and inconclusive at Day 91 (Safety Follow Up). The immunogenicity status of this patient was 
classified as non-treatment emergent positive. 
For patient AN 0383, the Day 84 post-dose sample (Cycle 5) tested positive in the screening and 
confirmatory assays, and was also confirmed positive in the NAb assay. Two additional immunogenicity 
samples were collected on day 169 (Cycle 9) and Day 253 (Cycle 13). Both samples tested positive in 
the screening assay but were inconclusive in the confirmatory assay

Immune-related AEs 
Based  on  updated  pooled  data  from  studies  P001  and  P002,  the  following  cumulative  incidences  for 
immune-related  AEs  were  calculated:    7.4%  for  hypothyroidism,  2.6%  for  pneumonitis,  2.4%  for

Following  this  safety  review,  Thyroid  Disorder  (Hypothyroidism,  Hyperthyroidism,  Thyroiditis), 
Pneumonitis,  Colitis  and  Hepatitis  were  confirmed  as  immune-related  events  causally  associated  with 
pembrolizumab, and further adverse reactions (Hypophysitis, including Hypopituitarism and Secondary 
Adrenal  Insufficiency;  Uveitis;  Type  1  Diabetes  Mellitus,  Nephritis,  Pancreatitis,  Myositis,  Severe  Skin 
Reaction  and  Infusion-Related  Reaction)  were  newly  added  to  the  list  of  Important  Identified  Risk. 
Gastrointestinal perforation secondary to colitis was considered as Potential Risk.

Treated with pembrolizumab (APaT Population) 
Except  for  9  patients in  whom  pneumonitis  apparently  persisted  at the  time of  the  analysis,  all  other 
cases  (17)  of  pneumonitis  were  reported to  have  resolved.  In  the  2  mg/kg  Q3W  and  10  mg/kg  Q3W 
dose  groups,  no  subjects  reported  more  than  1  event  of  pneumonitis.  In  the  10  mg/kg  Q2W  dose 
group,  there  were  9  events  of  pneumonitis  in  7  subjects.  Corticosteroids  were  used  to  manage 
pneumonitis in 9 of 26 (34.6%) subjects (all with Grade 2-3 pneumonitis).

Two  subjects  were  reported  to  have  2  episodes  of  hyperthyroidism,  and  all  other  subjects  were 
reported  to  have  a  single  episode.  The  event  was  reported  as  resolved  in  19  of  the  24  cases. 
Corticosteroids  were  used  to  manage  hyperthyroidism  in  2  subjects,  who  both  received  high-dose 
(defined  as  ≥40  mg/day  of  prednisone,  or  equivalent)  corticosteroids.  Hyperthyroidism  was  reported 
as resolved in both patients.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the IPI-refractory melanoma patient population of study P002, 10.1%, and 14.5%, of patients in the 
2 mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q3W pembrolizumab arms, respectively, and 11.7% in the chemotherapy 
control arm discontinued treatment due to AEs.  
In  the  pooled  melanoma  population  (P001+P002),  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  were  reported  in 
8.2%  of  patients  in  the  2  mg/kg  Q3W,  in  12.4%  of  patients  in  10  mg/kg  Q3W,  and  in  15.0%  of 
patients in 10 mg/kg Q2W treatment arms, respectively. 
With the exception of General disorders and administration site conditions SOC (n=24,2.4%), no SOC 
had  an  overall  incidence  >2.0%.  However,  within  a  dose  group,  the  Respiratory,  thoracic  and 
mediastinal  disorders  (driven  by  pneumonitis,  n=3,  1.7%  overall)  SOC  and  the  Nervous  system 
disorders SOC (n=5, spread out over 5 different AEs) had an incidence of 2.8% in the 10 mg/kg Q2W 
treatment  arms.  Also,  the  Gastrointestinal  disorders  SOC  had  an  incidence  of  2.2%  in  both  the  10 
mg/kg  Q3W  and  10  mg/kg  Q2W  treatment  arms,  which  was  driven  by  colitis  (n=4,  0.8%)  and 
diarrhoea (n=2, 1.1%), respectively. 
Page 143/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall,  44  (4.3%)  subjects  discontinued  treatment  due  to  drug-related  AEs,  including  2.9%  of 
subjects  in  the  2  mg/kg  Q3W  group,  4.5%  of  subjects  in  the  10  mg/kg  Q3W  group,  and  6.7%  of 
subjects in the 10 mg/kg Q2W group. Across all doses, only pneumonitis and colitis were drug-related 
AEs leading to discontinuation that occurred in 5 or more subjects (n=7 and n=5, respectively). Other 
drug-related  AEs  that  caused  discontinuation  in  more  than  1  subject  were:  hyperthyroidism, 
hypophysitis,  hypopituitarism,  fatigue,  generalized  oedema,  and  autoimmune  hepatitis  which  all 
occurred in 2 subjects each. 
Post marketing experience 
The applicant submitted data on post-marketing experience. Keytruda (pembrolizumab) was approved 
in the U.S. on 04-Sep-2014 for the treatment of subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma 
and disease progression following ipilimumab and, if BRAF V600 mutation positive, a BRAF inhibitor. 
The safety reporting database was queried to retrieve all SAEs and non-serious cases spontaneously 
reported in the US in temporal association with pembrolizumab through 30-Nov-2014. A total of 57 
cases, including 28 SAEs, were identified. The most commonly reported SAEs were the PTs of death (8 
events), malignant melanoma (4 events), adverse event unspecified (3 events), disease progression (2 
events), and metastatic melanoma (2 events). All other SAE terms were reported only once. 
Seventeen of the 57 cases reported a fatal outcome, with the vast majority associated with either 
disease progression and/or complications of on-going medical conditions at the time of the fatal 
outcome. No safety signals have been identified.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The pembrolizumab safety database submitted to support the application consisted of safety data from 
1012  patients  enrolled  in  study  P001  (Part  B1,  B2,  B3  and  D)  and  in  study  P002.  This  includes 
comparative  safety  data  versus  standard  of  care  chemotherapy  in  patients  with  advanced  melanoma 
refractory to ipilimumab (Study P002). 
In addition, early safety results from the first interim analysis of P006 (data cutoff date 3 Sep 2014) 
providing comparative data versus ipilimumab in IPI-naïve advanced melanoma have also been 
provided. However, a pooled analysis was not feasible at the time of the interim analysis, hence 
section 4.8 of the SmPC includes all ADRs evaluated in 1012 patients across three doses (2 mg/kg 
every 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks) in clinical studies P001 and P002. 
No major differences in the safety profile were observed between the 2 mg/kg dose and the 10 mg/kg 
dose when given on a Q3W schedule. Overall 340 received pembrolizumab at the recommended dose 
of 2 mg/kg Q3W proposed for the treatment of advanced melanoma. 
In the pooled melanoma population (Studies P001 and P002) 79% of patients reported drug-related 
AEs, of which 13.5% were Grade 3-5. The most common adverse drug reactions observed were in the 
General disorders and administration site conditions (47.7%), Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
(46.3%), Gastrointestinal disorders (31.2%), Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (23.6%), 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (14.4%), Nervous System Disorders (14.2%), 
Metabolism and nutrition disorders (12.2%) SOCs. Severe adverse drug reactions were more 
frequently reported in Gastrointestinal disorders (2.7%), General disorders and administration site 
conditions (1.6%) and Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (1.6%). 
A higher rate of adverse drug reactions was reported in P002 with chemotherapy (80.7%) in 
comparison to pembrolizumab (68% at 2 mg/kg and 74.3% at 10 mg/kg Q3W). In particular, drug-
Page 144/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
related Grade 3-5 AEs were registered in 26.3% of patients treated with chemotherapy, while the rate 
in patients who received pembrolizumab was 11.2% and 14% in the 2 mg/kg Q3w and 10 mg/kg 
Q3W, respectively. 
In both IPI-refractory patients of study P002 and IPI naïve patients of study P006, the Grade ≥3 AEs 
tended  to  occur  later  in  the  pembrolizumab  arms  in  comparison  with  standard  chemotherapy  or 
ipilimumab. 
An analysis of immune-related ADRs (irADRs) based on pooled data from studies P001 (cut-off 18 Apr 
2014)  and  P002  (12  May  2014),  including  1012  melanoma  patients,  together  with  a  cross-program 
medical case review of SAEs and non-SAEs events of clinical interest from all clinical studies regardless 
of  indication  (3251  subjects)  and  the  melanoma  expanded  access  program  (1787  subjects)  has  been 
performed.  Following  this  safety  review,  Thyroid  Disorder  (Hypothyroidism,  Hyperthyroidism, 
thyroiditis),  Pneumonitis,  Colitis  and  Hepatitis  were  confirmed  as  immune-related  events  causally 
associated  with  pembrolizumab,  and  the  following  adverse  reactions:  Hypophysitis,  including 
Hypopituitarism  and  Secondary  Adrenal  Insufficiency;  Uveitis;  Type  1  Diabetes  Mellitus,  Nephritis, 
Pancreatitis and Infusion-Related Reaction, Myositis and Severe Skin Reaction have been added to the 
list  of  Important  Identified  Risk.  Based  on  updated  pooled  data,  the  following  cumulative  incidences 
were calculated:  7.4% for hypothyroidism, 2.6% for pneumonitis, 2.4% for hyperthyroidism, 2.0% for 
infusion-related  reaction,  1.6%  for  colitis,  1.5%  for  severe  skin-reactions,  1.1%  for  thyroiditis,  1.0% 
for hypophysitis, 0.8% for hepatitis, 0.8% for uveitis, 0.4% for nephritis, 0.4% for myositis, 0.2% for 
adrenal insufficiency, 0.2% for pancreatitis, 0.1% for type 1 diabetes mellitus, (see section 4.4 and 4.8 
of the SmPC for management of immune-related ADRs). These ADRs have been included in the RMP as 
important identified risks. In general, the duration of treatment seems to correlate with the occurrence 
of  adverse  events  of  special  interest  (AEOSI).  In  order  to  minimise  the  risks  associated  with  these 
ADRs and to raise awareness to healthcare professionals and patients/carers on the early identification 
and  detection  of  the  signs  and  symptoms  these  ADRs,  the  CHMP  imposed  the  company  to  provide 
educational material will be distributed by the MAH. This was considered by the CHMP as a condition to 
the market authorisation (see Annex II of the SmPC).  
Since  patients  with  severe  (grade  3)  irADRs  on  prior  IPI  requiring  corticosteroids  for  >  12  weeks,  or 
life-threatening irAEs on prior IPI were not eligible in Study P001 and P002, and data regarding AEs on 
prior ipilimumab treatment were not systematically collected, it is not possible to draw any conclusion 
on this issue at the present stage. Patients that had active systemic autoimmune disease, patients with 
HIV  or  hepatitis  B  or  C  were  excluded  from  enrolling  in  the  studies.  These  patient  populations  are 
included in the RMP as missing information. The trend observed versus a lower incidence of immune-
related  AEs  in  ipi-treated  in  comparison  to  ipi-naïve  patients  may  be  biased  and  driven  by  an 
unintended  selection  of  patients.  The  use  of  pembrolizumab  in  patients  with  severe  (grade  3)  irADRs 
on  prior  IPI  requiring  corticosteroids  for  >  12  weeks,  or  life-threatening  irADRs  on  prior  IPI  is 
considered as missing information, and the lack of data is included in the SmPC section 4.4.  
A  review  of  gastrointestinal  perforation  and  colitis  reports  was  performed  by  the  Applicant  involving 
more  than  5000  patients  who  received  pembrolizumab  in  clinical  trials  and  in  the  Expanded  Access 
Program.  Based  on  the  potential  life-threatening  nature  of  the  event  (1  fatal  case  was  reported)  and 
the  limited  information  that  hampers  the  real  estimation  of  the  events,  GI  perforation  secondary  to 
colitis has been added as a potential risk in the RMP and reflected in the SmPC Section 4.4. 
There is no strong evidence supporting an influence of age on the safety profile, although a trend to a 
higher rate of drug-related AEs and discontinuations due to AEs has been reported in older patients. 
Based on submitted data no major differences in the pembrolizumab safety profile appear by age 
classes in both ipi-naïve and ipi-treated patients.  
Page 145/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Only two patients in study 001 tested positive for ADA to pembrolizumab and the presence of these 
antibodies seemed to have no impact on pembrolizumab PK. However, in the majority of ADA negative 
samples at the screening and in the confirmatory assays (1116 out of 2058), pembrolizumab 
concentration was above the drug tolerance level (25 μg/mL). Drug tolerance was shown to interfere 
to a different degree in the two dose groups (all dose regimens and 2 mg/Kg Q3W). While 64% of 
patients, who received 2mg/kg, were assessable for immunogenicity, in the overall population also 
including 10 mg/kg dose regimens, it was only 27%. Given the low number of evaluable patients for 
immunogenicity and the missing validation report for ADAs, immunogenicity has been included as 
important potential risks.   
The applicant did not submit safety data on various ethnic groups. This has been included in the RMP 
as missing information. 
Based on the current assessment of events with fatal outcome from studies P001, P002, P006, P010, 
and P012, as of 31 Aug 2014, overall 15 fatal cases considered drug-related by the investigator have 
been reported. Pneumonitis fatal events reported in NSCLC patient has been included in section 4.8 of 
the  SmPC  and  in  the  RMP  as  important  identified  risks.  Fatal  events  for  pembrolizumab  will  be 
monitored by routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
The long term safety of pembrolizumab is unknown and has been included as missing information in 
the RMP. As some patients experience a relatively prolonged response to pembrolizumab, several 
ongoing studies in the PhV plan are being conducted which will provide further evidence on the long 
term safety of pembrolizumab treatment (See section 2.8 – pharmacovigilance plan). 
Safety data is missing from patients who have previously had a severe hypersensitivity reaction to 
treatment with another mAb as the exclusion criteria from the studies excluded this patient population. 
Therefore, this has been included as missing information in the RMP. 
There are limited data on the safety and efficacy of KEYTRUDA in patients with ocular melanoma (see 
SmPC section 5.1). The safety and efficacy of KEYTRUDA in children below 18 years of age have not 
yet been established. No data are available. 
Pembrolizumab may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue has been 
reported following administration of pembrolizumab (see section 4.7). 
There is no information on overdose with pembrolizumab. In case of overdose, patients must be 
closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, and appropriate symptomatic treatment 
instituted (SmPC section 4.9). 
The use of keytruda is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to the active substance or to 
any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 (SmPC  section 4.3). 
Special precautions for disposal and other handling are included in section 6.6 of the SmPC. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The  ADRs  reported  for  patients  being  treated  with  pembrolizumab  appear  to  be  mostly  of  low  grade 
and  manageable.  It  was  noted  that  immunological  ADRs  include  skin,  gastrointestinal,  endocrine, 
hepatic, pulmonary and renal events. These are managed appropriately with the recommendations as 
stated in the SmPC section 4.2,  4.4 and 4.8 and are also addressed in the RMP.  However, in order to 
Page 146/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
raise  the  awareness  of  health  care  professionals,  patients  and/or  their  caregivers  about  the  potential 
for  immune-related  adverse  events  and  infusion-related  reactions,  which  are  considered  important 
identified  risks,  the  CHMP  has  imposed  an  educational  programme  for  both  healthcare  professionals 
and patients to help on the identification and detection of the signs and symptoms relevant to the early 
recognition/identification of those ADRS.  
In  conclusion,  the  CHMP  considers  that  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  pembrolizumab  has  been 
described appropriately and is acceptable.  
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements. 
2.8.  Risk Management Plan 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.2 could be acceptable if the applicant 
implements the changes to the RMP as described in the PRAC endorsed PRAC Rapporteur assessment 
report.  
The applicant implemented the changes in the RMP as requested by PRAC.  
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 1.3 with the following content:

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Pembrolizumab, an antibody that binds to PD-1 and blocks binding to the natural ligand PD-L1 and PD-
L2, has shown significant treatment benefit in terms of ORR and DCR , together with preliminary data 
on the duration of stable disease, duration of response, PFS and OS in both IPI-refractory/treated and 
IPI-naïve patients, respectively, in the open label phase 1 study P001.  
In IPI-refractory patients (cohort B2), ORR (25.9% and 26.3%) and there were a total of 43 confirmed 
objective responses, with duration ranging from 12+ to 62+ weeks at the time of the analysis. The 
median time to response was 12 weeks (range 7-48). 
 In IPI-naïve patients (cohort D), ORR (33.3% and 40.43%),  and the duration of response ranged 
from 6+ to 61+ weeks across both arms. The median time to response was 12 weeks (range 11-39) 
and  83% of patients had non-PD at the time of the analysis. 
Further data from study P002, a randomized controlled trial versus chemotherapy in IPI-refractory 
advanced melanoma patients also showed a clinically relevant result in terms of PFS of  with HR: 0.57 
(95%CI 0.45-0.73; p-value <0.0001). OS was not statistically significant at the time of the interim 
analysis (median OS 11.4 [HR:0.88; 95%CI 10.2- not reached); p-value=0.229])  
Early results from the randomized, controlled, phase III study P006 comparing pembrolizumab (10 
mg/kg Q3W and 10 mg/kg Q2W) to ipilimumab in IPI-naïve advanced melanoma patients showed 
compelling results for PFS and OS where both pembrolizumab arms met the pre-specified criteria for a 
positive PFS outcome at the first interim analysis, with a HR of 0.58 for both treatment arms 
(individually) compared to IPI ( one-sided p-value <0.00001 in both comparisons, favoring 
pembrolizumab). Median PFS was 5.5 and 4.1 months for pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q2W and 10 
mg/kg Q3W arms compared to 2.8 months for IPI. After 6-months, 46-47% of patients were alive and 
progression free on pembrolizumab, and 27% on IPI. The hazard ratio for OS is 0.63 (p=0.00052) for 
pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg Q2W over the control arm and 0.69 (p=0.00358 ) for pembrolizumab 10 
mg/kg Q3W over the control arm, respectively, with no difference between the two pembrolizumab 
arms compared to each other (HR 0.91, p=0.51319) . The median OS has not yet been reached in all 
three arms, and the 12-month OS rates are 74.1% (95% CI: 68.5%, 78.9%) and 68.4% (95% CI: 
62.5%, 73.6%) for pembrolizumab at Q2W and Q3W, respectively, compared to 58.2% (95% CI: 
51.8%, 64.0%) in the control arm. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
There is some uncertainty in the knowledge of pembrolizumab in the long term efficacy in naïve and 
previously untreated patients as the efficacy data submitted for both studies P002 and P006 were 
based on interim analyses. Therefore, a PAES to confirm the long term efficacy of pembrolizumab were 
imposed as condition to the MA and reflected in the Annex II. 
A numerical trend towards a lower efficacy of the 2mg/kg Q3W dose compared to 10 mg/kg Q3W dose 
in  both  PD-L1  negative  and  BRAFV600-mutated  patients  was  observed  in  studies  P001  and  P002, 
however, no exposure-response relationship for pembrolizumab both subgroups could be demonstrated 
in  the  integrated  exposure-response  analysis.  Although  it  is  acknowledged  that  the  benefit  of 
pembrolizumab  in  the  overall  population  as  well  as  in  the  PD-L1  negative  and  BRAFV600-mutated 
patients  subgroup  analyses,  has  been  demonstrated,  this  evidence  is  currently  based  on  a  relatively 
Page 155/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
limited number of patients at the recommended dose of 2 mg/kg Q3W. Therefore, a PAES to have the 
updated  efficacy  data  for  the  patients  is  required  to  further  characterise  the  magnitude  of  the 
treatment effect in these two subgroups was imposed as a condition to the MA and reflected in Annex 
II. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The pembrolizumab safety database submitted consisted of safety data from 1012 patients enrolled in 
study P001 (Part B1, B2, B3 and D) and in study P002. In addition, early safety results from the first 
interim analysis of P006 (data cutoff date 3 Sep 2014) also provided further safety information for 
patients treated with pembrolizumab.  No major differences in the safety profile were observed 
between the 2 mg/kg dose and the 10 mg/kg dose when given on a Q3W schedule. Overall 340 
received pembrolizumab at the recommended dose of 2 mg/kg Q3W proposed for the treatment of 
advanced melanoma.  
The most frequently reported ADRs (>10%) with the 2 mg/kg dose Q3W were fatigue, pruritus, rash, 
arthralgia, diarrhoea, decreased appetite, cough, and vitiligo. 
Serious  ADRs  were  more  frequently  reported  in  Gastrointestinal  disorders  (2.7%),  General  disorders 
and administration site conditions (1.6%) and Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (1.6%).  
On  the  basis  of  the  mechanism  of  action,  several  immune-mediated  AEs  were  identified  as  ADRs. 
Among  these,  those  observed  with  an  incidence  >  1%  were  hypothyroidism,  pneumonitis, 
hyperthyroidism,  colitis,  severe  skin-reactions,  thyroiditis,  and  hypophysitis,  and  in  addition  severe 
skin  reactions  and  infusion-related  reaction.  Other  immune-related  ADRs  were  gastrointestinal 
perforation,  hypopituitarism,  secondary  adrenal  insufficiency,  thyroiditis,  uveitis,  pancreatitis,type  1 
diabetes mellitus, hepatitis, nephritis, and myositis.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
AEs of special interest will be systematically assessed within ongoing and planned studies (see RMP). 
Gastrointestinal  perforation  secondary  to  colitis  and  immunogenicity  have  been  defined  as  important 
potential risk and are appropriately managed through the RMP and SmPC.  The uncertainty in relation 
to the safety in the patient populations described in the missing information in the RMP will be handled 
through routine risk minimisation measures and/or routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Consistent  evidence  of  a  treatment  benefit  has  been  generated  across  the  three  main  studies 
submitted in support of pembrolizumab in the treatment of advanced melanoma. The updated data for 
P001  supports  the  activity  and  benefit  of  pembrolizumab  in  ipi-refractory  and  ipi-naive  advanced 
melanoma  patients  in  terms  of  proportion  of  responders  and  duration  of  response.  In  addition,  the 
interim  results  from  P002  comparing  pembrolizumab  with  standard  chemotherapy  strengthen  the 
evidence of treatment benefit in IPI-refractory melanoma patients in terms of PFS. The top line results 
in  IPI  naïve  melanoma  patients  from  study  P006  show  a  clinically  meaningful  advantage  of 
pembrolizumab over ipilimumab in terms of PFS.  
Page 156/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  magnitude  of  treatment  effect  is  compelling  and  clinically  relevant  for  both  the  IPI-refractory 
melanoma  patient  population,  as  well  as  in  the  IPI-naïve  patients.  Furthermore,  the  safety  profile  of 
pembrolizumab appears manageable and compares favorably with both chemotherapy and ipilimumab.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Based on the totality of the data from the interim results from studies P002 and P006 as well as the 
results from study P001, the benefits of pembrolizumab treatment in advanced (metastatic or 
unresectable) melanoma patients outweighed the risks. Therefore, the CHMP considers that the 
benefit-risk balance for pembrolizumab in the proposed indication is positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus

Patient Information Brochure   
The patient alert card  
The Patient Information Brochure and Patient alert card shall contain the following key elements: 
•  Description of the main signs or symptoms of the irARs and the importance of notifying their 
treating physician immediately if symptoms occur  
• 
• 
The importance of not attempting to self-treat any symptoms without consulting their 
Healthcare professional first 
The importance of carrying the Patient Alert Card at all times and to show it at all medical 
visits to healthcare professionals other than the prescriber (e.g. emergency healthcare 
professionals). The Card reminds patients about key symptoms that need to be reported 
immediately to the physician/nurse. It also contains prompts to enter contact details of the 
physician and to alert other physicians that the patient is treated with Keytruda

Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures 
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures: 
Description 
Due date 
1.  Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): The MAH should submit the final 
1Q 2017 
study report for study P002: Randomized, Phase II Study of MK-3475 versus 
Chemotherapy in Patients with Advanced Melanoma – Final Study Report 
2.  Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): The MAH should submit the final 
1Q 2017 
study report for study P006: A Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled, Three-
Arm, Phase III Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Two Dosing 
Schedules of MK-3475 Compared to Ipilimumab in Patients with Advanced 
Melanoma – Final Study Report 
Page 159/160 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.  Post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES): In order to confirm the benefit in 
BRAF V600 mutant and in PD-L1 negative patient subgroups at the 
recommended dose, the MAH should provide updated analyses from Study 
P001 and P002:  
•  Updated efficacy data in subgroups comparing 2 vs 10 mg/kg Q3W from the 
1Q 2017 
P002 final analysis.  
• 
Efficacy data in subgroups comparing the 2 vs 10 mg/kg Q3W from P001, using 
the data cut-off date of 18-Oct-2014 from Parts B2 and D of P001 by dose 
level. 
3Q 2015 
4.  The value of biomarkers to predict the efficacy of pembrolizumab should be 
1Q 2017 
further explored, specifically: 
Although PD-L1 status is predictive of response in advanced melanoma 
patients, durable responses have been observed in PD-L1 negative patients. 
Additional biomarkers other than PD-L1 expression status by IHC (e.g. PD-L2, 
RNA signature, etc.) predictive of pembrolizumab efficacy should be 
investigated together with more information regarding the pattern of expression 
of PD-L1  obtained in the ongoing melanoma studies (P001, P002 and P006): 
•  Comparison between PD-L1 IHC staining in archival tissue vs newly 
obtained 
•  Comparison of PD-L1 IHC between pre and post treatment tumor tissues 
•  Data on the Nanostring RNA gene signature 
• 
IHC staining for PD-L2  
•  Data on RNA and proteomic serum profiling 
•  Data on Immune cell profiling (peripheral blood) 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product

Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of data on the quality properties of the active substance, the CHMP 
considers that pembrolizumab is qualified as a new active substance.

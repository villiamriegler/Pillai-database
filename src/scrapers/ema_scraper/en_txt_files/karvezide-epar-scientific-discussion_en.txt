SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
This  module  reflects  the  initial  scientific  discussion  and  scientific  discussion  on  procedures 
which  have  been  finalised  before  1  November  2004.  For  scientific  information  on  procedures 
after this date please refer to module 8B.  
1. 
Introduction 
The application is a new combination of two previously known active substances in the combinations 
150 mg/12.5 mg and 300 mg/12.5 mg of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ).  
Marketing  authorisations  have  previously  been  granted  to  irbesartan  150  mg  and  300  mg  tablets 
through  the  centralised  procedure.  Irbesartan  is  a  non-peptide  long  lasting  competitive  antagonist  of 
the  AT1-type  angiotensin  II  receptor  (AIIRA),  active  through  oral  administration.  HCTZ  is  a  well-
known thiazide diuretic. 
The  rationale  for  the  doses  submitted  in  this  application  are  related  to  the  second-line  strategy 
proposed  for  the  combination.  The  dose  of  150  mg/12.5  mg  is  proposed  as  an  alternative  to  the 
titration  to  300  mg  of  irbesartan  in  subjects  not  adequately  controlled  by  150  mg  irbesartan  or 
hydrochlorothiazide alone. Similarly, the dose of 300 mg/12.5 mg is proposed as an additional useful 
step  for  the  subjects  not  adequately  controlled  by  the  combination  150  mg/12.5  mg  or  by  300  mg 
monotherapy.

Part II: Chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Uncoated tablets 
Composition 
The  medicinal  product  is  available  in  the  form  of  tablets  with  doses  of  150  mg/12.5  mg  and 
300 mg/12.5  mg  of  irbesartan/HCTZ.  The  qualitative  and  quantitative  composition  is  adequately 
described.  No  overage  of  the  active  substances  is  used.  For  some  excipients,  variable  amounts  are 
proposed depending on the potency of the active substances.  
The medicinal product is packaged in opaque blister package made of polyvinyl chloride coated with 
white opaque polyvinylidene chloride, and heat sealed to aluminium foil backing. 
Clinical trial formula 
Clinical studies were performed with 12.5 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, 75 mg, or 100 mg irbesartan capsules; 
75  mg,  150  mg  and  300  mg  irbesartan  tablets;  and  6.25  mg,  12.5  mg,  or  25  mg  HCTZ  tablets.  All 
formulations  were  adequately  described.  The  compositions  of  irbesartan  tablets  were  the  ones 
previously authorised.  
In  support  of  this  application,  two  studies  were  conducted  to  demonstrate  bioequivalence  of  the 
proposed  commercial  tablets  with the  clinical  dosage forms. Dissolution results  on irbesartan/HCTZ 
150  mg/12.5  mg  and  300  mg/12.5  mg  tablets,  irbesartan  75  mg  and  100  mg  capsules,  and  HCTZ 
12.5 mg tablets used in the bioequivalence studies were also presented. Bioequivalence between both 
formulations was shown in both studies. 
Development pharmaceutics 
The development of the commercial formulation was satisfactory detailed.  
Irbesartan,  was  successfully  formulated  with  HCTZ  into  a  stable,  immediate  release  tablet.  The 
commercial  tablets  were  shown  to  be  equivalent  to  the  individual  clinical  irbesartan  capsules  and 
HCTZ tablets.  
Development  of  irbesartan/HCTZ  tablets  closely  followed  the  development  of  the  single  entity 
irbesartan  tablets,  in  terms  of  both  formulation  and  process.  Different  prototype  formulations  were 
developed  which  led  to  the  commercial  formulation.  Excipients  were  selected  based  on  their 
contributions to product stability.

The  irbesartan/HCTZ  formulation  differs  qualitatively  from  that  of  the  approved  irbesartan 
formulation by the exclusion of poloxamer, and the inclusion of red and yellow iron oxides, in order to 
impart a peach colour to distinguish them from the white single entity tablets. 
Studies  were  performed  to  evaluate  the  effects  of  excipients  or  different  processing  conditions  on 
powder and tablet properties, including dissolution. 
In-process controls 
During the manufacturing process, the dried granulation is tested for moisture content, and the tablets 
are tested for hardness and uniformity of mass.  
Process validation 
The  process  was  validated  by  the  manufacture  of  two  90  kg  batches  of  the  150  mg/12.5  mg 
combination, three 90 kg batches of the 300/12.5 mg combination, and one 270 kg batch 150/12.5 mg 
combination  in  Evansville.  In  addition,  two  pilot  scale  batches  (35  kg)  of  the  150/12.5  mg  potency 
combination  were  manufactured  in  New  Brunswick.  Granulation  was  tested  for  particle  size 
distribution,  bulk  density,  tap  density  and  flow.  The  finished  tablets  were  tested  for  potency, 
uniformity of content, dissolution, gauge, hardness, friability, weight,  and disintegration. The results 
showed that the tablets were within the proposed specifications and that the manufacturing process is 
adequately controlled. 
Control of Starting Materials 
Irbesartan 
The  routine  controls  are  supported  by  the  scientific  documentation.  The  proposed  specifications  are 
consistent  with  the  established  quality  and  supported  by  the  batch  analysis  data.  Test  methods  were 
updated to correspond to the current Ph.Eur.  
Scientific data presented in the dossier were acceptable. Irbesartan presents only positional isomerism. 
The  isomers  due  to  alternative  location  of  substitutes  in  the  phenyl  rings  are  controlled  during  the 
manufacturing process. 
The process description presented in the open and restricted part of the DMF is adequate. The results 
obtained on 14 batches from different manufacturers showed that all batches comply the specifications 
of the irbesartan drug substance.  
HCTZ  
The  manufacturing  process  was  adequately  described.  The  quality  of  the  starting  material  is  well 
established, adequately controlled and complies with the specifications of the current Ph.Eur.  
Scientific  data  presented  in  the  dossier  were  acceptable.  The  specifications  for  impurities  were 
adequately described and, although within the established of the Ph. Eur., could be tightened, on the 
basis  of  the  results  presented  of  the  batch  analysis. Results  from  an  analysis evaluating  the  possible 
reduction of the impurity limits were submitted and a tightened specification agreed.  
The  results  of  the  analysis  for  three  batches  showed  that  the  batches  comply with  the  specifications 
proposed. 
Other 
All excipients used in the manufacture of tablets comply with the specification of Ph. Eur. or of other 
Member  State  Pharmacopoeias.  Specifications  and  control  methods  of  packaging  material  are 
acceptable.  
Control tests on intermediate products 
Not applicable 
Control tests on the finished product 
The specifications for release and shelf life of the finished product, as well as the specifications for the 
active  substances,  are  acceptable.  The  limits  defined  for  impurities/degradation  products  have  been 
tightened  and  different  specifications  for  degradation  products  at  release  and  shelf-life  have  been 
established.

Stability 
Active substance 
Irbesartan 
8 batches were studied, of which 3 were from pilot scale production and 5 from industrial scale. The 
control  methods  were  correctly  described  and  demonstrated  stability.  12  months  long-term  stability 
data for commercial-scale lots are now available as well as the stability results of pilot-scale lots up to 
4 years. The re-test period when stored in double polyethylene bags placed in cardboard containers is 
3 years.  
HCTZ 
Stability studies were conducted on 13 batches manufactured between 1983 and 1995. Stability data of 
5 years are available for 9 batches, 4 years for one batch, 3 years for 1 batch and 2 years for 2 batches. 
Results showed that the specifications of HCTZ are met. HCTZ is known to be stable. 
Finished product 
(1) 
Stability  data  of  18  months  (8°C,  30°C,  25°C/60%  RH),  12  months  (30°C/60%  RH),  6  months 
(40°C/75% RH) and 3 months (50°C) were available at the time of submission for three 150 mg/12.5 
mg tablet batches with different packaging materials including the package for marketing. An updated 
stability  report  presents  24-months  data  which  support  the  proposed  shelf-life  of  24  months  when 
stored at temperature up to 30°C. 
Stability data were available at the time of submission for one 300 mg/12.5 mg batch in HDPE bottles 
and  clear  blisters  up  to  6  months  (8°C,  50°C,  25°C/60%  RH;  30°C/60%  RH;  40°C/75%  RH),  for  2 
batches in clear blister and one batch in HDPE bottle with desiccant for 3 months. An updated stability 
report presents 12-months data on one batch and 6-months data on two other batches. 
The batches meet the specifications proposed, except one batch of 300 mg/12.5 mg tablets packaged in 
clear blister for which the upper specification for a degradation product/total impurities was exceeded 
under storage conditions of 45°C/75%RH.  
For  the  300  mg/12.5  mg  strength,  no  results  were  presented  for  the  marketing  packaging  material 
neither  for  the  minimum  period  of  6  months  as  set  out  in  the  CPMP  ICH  stability  guideline 
implemented  in  January  1998.  Results  from  stability  studies  will  be  submitted  for  the  first  three 
batches  of  the  300  mg/12.5  mg  strength  tablets  made  at  the  commercial  scale  and  packaged  in  the 
commercial blister opaque package.  
Results  from  additional  stability  studies  showed  that  tablet  qualities  were  not  affected  by  the 
freeze/thaw cycle and two different light sources. 
Bioequivalence 
A capsule formulation of irbesartan and a tablet formulation of HCTZ were used in the core efficacy 
and safety trials. Two separate 2-way, crossover studies (study CV131-054, study CV131-100) were 
conducted.  Both  strengths  of  irbesartan/HCTZ  combination  tablet  formulations  are  bioequivalent  to 
the clinical irbesartan capsules and HCTZ tablet formulations. 
Film-coated tablets 
Composition 
The  medicinal product is presented also as film coated tablets containing  150/12.5  mg and  300/12.5 
mg of irbesartan and hydrochlorothiazide respectively as active ingredients. Other ingredients include 
lactose  monohydrate  as  diluent,  microcrystalline  cellulose  as  diluent  and  binder,  hypromellose  as 
binder, croscarmellose sodium as disintergrant, silicon dioxide as glidant and magnesium stearate as 
lubricant. The film coating consists of a commercially available film coating material containg lactose 
monohydrate,  hypromellose,  titanium  dioxide,  macrogol  3000  and  yellow  and  red  iron/ferric  oxides 
(Opadry II pink 32F24503) and carnauba wax as a polishing agent. 
The product is packaged in the same packaging as the approved formulation.

Active substance 
The manufacturing method and the specifications of the active substances remain the same as the ones 
used for the uncoated tablets. 
Other ingredients 
Except  for  Hypromellose,  Opadry  II  pink  32F24503  and  Carnauba  wax,  all  other  excipients  are 
already  used  in  the  currently  approved  formulation.  The  excipients  comply  with  Eur.  Ph. 
Requirements and Opadry II pink is controlled according to an in house monograph, which employs 
simple  identification  procedures  derived  from  compedial  methods,  which  are  specific  to  the 
ingredients to be identified. 
There are two potential specified risk materials used in the proposed formulation: lactose monohydrate 
in the film coating and magnesium stearate. A TSE certificate of suitability has been provided together 
with a confirmation from the manufacturer of lactose monohydrate that it is derived from milk from 
healthy  animals  in  the  same  conditions  as  the  one  collected  for  human  consumption  in  accordance 
with  the  CPMP  “Note  for  Guidance  on  Minimising  the  Risk  of  Transmitting  Animal  Spongiform 
Encephalopathy Agents via Medicinal Products”. Magnesium stearate is of vegetable origin. 
The packaging materials are the same as  for the uncoated tablets 
Product development and finished product 
The new formulation of irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide film coated tablets has been developed in order 
to  mask  the  bitterness  of  the  drug  substances  by  applying  a  film  coating  to  the  tablet  that  does  not 
change its dissolution profile. In addition, some minor changes have been in the formulation. Among 
them  is  the  replacement  of  pregelatinized  maize  starch  and  poloxamer  with  hypromellose  and  the 
decrease in the size of the tablet keeping the shape similar to that of the currently marketed tablets and 
change of the code number engraved on the tablet 
The  manufacturing  process  is  a  standard  wet  granulation  method  and  remains  unchanged  except  for 
the addition of a final coating step.  
In process control data from testing at various points during manufacturing showed consistent results, 
which complied with the specifications and show no significant variation between or within batches. 
Process  validation  results  from  two  batches  on  the  critical  parameters  affecting  the  granulation, 
tableting and coating process confirm that the manufacturing  method is robust and reproducible and 
yields product with the same quality characteristics as the currently approved one. 
Product specification 
The  specifications  and  analytical  procedures  for  the  proposed  irbesartan  film-coated  tablets  are  the 
same as those for the currently approved product, with the exception of (i) appearance, which differs 
by an engraved digit code number, (ii) the addition of an identification test for the fim coating coloring 
agent,  titanium  dioxide  and  iron  oxides  (red/yellow)  and  (iii)  the  minor  revision  of  the  sample 
preparation procedure for the assay/degradants test . 
Additional validation testing has been performed for some of the analytical procedures (identification, 
assay, degradation products and dissolution testing) due to the quantitative and qualitative changes of 
the excipients in the product formulation. The results confirm the lack of interference of the excipients 
used with the active substances and prove that the analytical meethods employed are suitable for the 
evaluation and release testing of the product. 
Product specifications are justified by the results of the long-term stability studies and batch analysis 
data from four batches for eachcombination, manufactured using the same method and equipment as 
the proposed commercial ones. No new degradation products have been observed neither were any of 
the known degradants observed at higher levels than in the already approved formulation.

Stability of the Product 
Three  batches  for  each  of  the  combinations  packaged  in  the  packaging  intended  for  marketing  have 
been  placed  in  stability  studies  in  accordance  with  ICH  guidelines.  Test  results  good  stability  at 
40oC/75% RH, 30oC/60% RH and 25oC/60% RH. No significant attribute was noted for any batch. 
As suggested from the stability studies results the proposed shelf life under the conditions specified in 
the SPC is acceptable. The stability studies for the proposed formulation will however continue for up 
to 36 months 
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The addition of the coating step and the changes in the excipients have been adequately described and 
validated.  The  obtained  stability  results  show  no  different  trends  form  the  coated  formulation  and 
justify the proposed shelf life under the specified in the SPC conditions.

Part III: Toxico-pharmacological aspects 
Preclinical  studies  were  carried  out  with  the  active  substances  in  combination  to  identify  potential 
interactions. These studies include: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
One pharmacodynamic study in spontaneously hypertensive rats 
One pharmacodynamic study in normotensive rats and monkeys 
Single oral toxicity studies in mice and rats 
Repeated oral doses toxicity studies over six months in rats and monkeys 
One reproduction toxicity study (teratogenesis) in rats 
Battery of genotoxicity tests in vitro and in vivo 
Pharmacodynamics  
Irbesartan 
The pharmacodynamics of irbesartan are well known. Its effects were investigated in vitro and in vivo 
in  various  animal  species  including  rodents,  rabbits,  dogs  and  monkeys.  Irbesartan  showed  a  high 
affinity and selective antagonism of the angiotensin II subtype AT1 receptor.  
HCTZ  
The pharmacodynamics of HCTZ are well known. It reduces blood pressure in volume dependent and 
in salt-induced hypertension, as well as in renin-dependent hypertensive rat models. 
Irbesartan and HCTZ  
The  combination  of  irbesartan/HCTZ  was  studied  in  normotensive  rats  and  monkeys,  and  in 
spontaneously hypertensive rats. Data in normotensive rats and monkeys were obtained from 6-month 
toxicity studies carried out with irbesartan/HCTZ at doses of 10/10 and 90/90 mg/kg/day. The lower 
dose of 10 mg/kg of irbesartan corresponds to the maximum antihypertensive effect in most models of 
hypertension.  
In the 6-month study of normotensive rats, the combination of irbesartan/HCTZ at doses of 10/10 and 
90/90  mg/kg/day  reduced  systolic  arterial  pressure  (SAP)  with  a  dose-related  effect,  and  with  a 
tendency  to  a  time-related  effect  between  15  and  24  weeks.  After  6  months  of  treatment,  the 
combination  of  irbesartan/HCTZ  at  90/90  mg/kg  caused  a  greater  reduction  of  SAP  with  respect  to 
irbesartan alone at 90 mg/kg. The combination 90/90 mg/kg/day was not consistently more effective in 
lowering SAP than irbesartan alone. 
In  normotensive  monkeys,  only  the  effect  of  the  combination  90/90  mg/kg/day  on  SAP  was 
statistically significant at the end of the 6-month oral study. Coadministration of irbesartan/HCTZ at a 
dose of 90/90 mg/kg provided a greater reduction in SAP than irbesartan alone at 90 mg/kg. Compared 
to the components, the effect was additive. 
5 
                   EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In spontaneously hypertensive rats, irbesartan was administered in a wide range of pharmacologically 
active  doses  (up  to  13  mg/kg/day)  with  HCTZ  (10  mg/kg).  Oral  administration  at  13/10  mg/kg  for 
three  days  led  to  a  maximum  antihypertensive  effect  from  days  1  to  3.  This  antihypertensive  effect 
was significantly higher than that observed at the equivalent dose of irbesartan administered alone on 
days 1 and 2. Administration of irbesartan produced decreases in mean arterial pressure, which were 
not dose-dependent on day 1 and 2. However, dose-dependency was demonstrated on day 3.  
The  studies  with  the  association  were  considered  well  designed  although  some  did  not  comply  with 
GLP.  Although 
the  combination  was  convincingly 
demonstrated  only  in  spontaneously  hypertensive  rats,  the  doses  selected  and  the  ratio  of  doses  of 
irbesartan and HCTZ were considered adequate.

Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic data  for  each  component  were  obtained from  the  toxicokinetic data in the 6-month 
studies carried out in rats and monkeys with the irbesartan/HCTZ association at doses of 10/10 mg/kg 
and 90/90/mg/kg/day. 
Irbesartan 
The pharmacokinetics of irbesartan are well known in the animal species studied (rats and monkeys). 
Irbesartan is completely and rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Bioavailability is low in rats 
because of the extensive first hepatic pass. In monkeys, bioavailability is above 60%. Irbesartan and 
its metabolites are quickly distributed in most organs and tissues, including intrauterine tissue, and are 
excreted in milk. The ratio of tissue/plasma concentrations (as measured by radioactivity) is less than 
one for most tissues. 
The  main  compound  in  plasma  is  the  unchanged  active  substance.  In  animals,  the  main  elimination 
route  is  N-glycosidation,  followed  by  biliary  excretion,  and  finally  faecal  excretion.  All  metabolites 
detected in humans are observed in the animal species studied.  
CYP2C9  is  the  most  important  enzyme  in  the  oxidative  metabolism  of  irbesartan.  In  vitro  studies 
showed  significant  inhibition  of  the  formation  of  oxidised  metabolites  of  irbesartan  with  known 
substrates inhibiting CYP2C9 (warfarine, tolbutamide, sulphaphenazol  and nifedipine). Results of in 
vivo studies, however, indicated a lack of significant interaction between irbesartan and warfarine or 
nifedipine. 
HCTZ  
The  main  pharmacokinetic  parameters  of  HCTZ  were  obtained  from  humans.  HCTZ  is  absorbed 
rapidly  with  a  bioavailability  of  around  60%  after  oral  administration.  Plasma  levels  and  urinary 
excretion  of  HCTZ  are  dose  proportional.  HCTZ  accumulates  in  erythrocytes  and  does  not 
significantly  bind  to  plasma  proteins.  It  passes  the  placental  barrier  and  is  excreted  in  milk.  The 
substance is  slightly  metabolised  in rats,  monkeys, and almost  completely excreted in  humans as an 
unchanged substance in urine. Urinary excretion is around 50-70% of the administered dose. 
Irbesartan/HCTZ  
Both in rats and monkeys, plasma concentrations and Tmax of irbesartan following oral administration 
of irbesartan/HCTZ at a dose of 90/90 mg/kg/day, or irbesartan alone at a dose of 90 mg/kg/day were 
comparable, suggesting that HCTZ does not alter the availability and the exposure of irbesartan. 
However, a pharmacokinetic interaction was observed in rats and macaques when HCTZ was given in 
combination  with  irbesartan  (90/90  mg/kg/day).  Plasma  concentrations  of  HCTZ  were  consistently 
higher when HCTZ was given with irbesartan. Exposure to HCTZ increased by 60 % in macaques and 
86 % in rats with the administration of the irbesartan/HCTZ combination (90/90 mg/kg/day) compared 
to HCTZ alone (90 mg/kg/day). The mechanism whereby irbesartan increases plasma levels of HCTZ 
is  not  clearly  established.  However,  this  increase  does  not  represent  a  safety  concern  because  the 
interaction was not observed in man and HCTZ AUCs in animals are approximately 100 times higher 
than human AUCs at the therapeutic dose.  
Pharmacokinetic data in animals for the separate species were scant but it must be taken into account 
that  both  substances  are  used  in  therapy  for  humans  and  that  toxicokinetic  trials  considered  as 
sufficient  were  carried  out  with  the  association  of  irbesartan/HCTZ.  All  metabolites  detected  in 
6 
                   EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
humans were observed in various biological fluids in the different species studied.  
Toxicology 
The toxicity profiles for both compounds administered separately were well described.  
Single dose toxicity 
Irbesartan/HCTZ  combination  up  to  maximum  doses  of  2,000/4,000  mg/kg  in  mice  or  3,000/500 
mg/kg in rats did not show any indication of toxicological interaction.  
Repeated dose toxicity 
In  a  six-month  repeated  dose  toxicity  study  in  rats,  the  drug-related  changes  were  decreased  SAP, 
slight decreases in haemoglobin and erythrocyte count, serum cholesterol and triglycerides, decreased 
heart  weight,  decreased  liver  weight  in  males,  hypertrophy/hyperplasia  of  the  juxtaglomerular 
apparatus, and a reduced incidence of progressive nephropathy. These were observed in the irbesartan 
(90  mg/kg)  and  in  the  combination  (10/10  and  90/90  mg/kg)  groups  and  were  attributable  to 
irbesartan.  However,  in  the  26-week  toxicology  study  in  rats  with  irbesartan  alone,  irbesartan  90 
mg/kg/day  did  not  cause  hyperplasia/hypertrophy  of  the  juxtaglomerular  apparatus.  The  company 
further discussed the discrepancies in this well-known response affecting the renin angiotensin system. 
It was agreed that these observations have no safety implications for humans as they seem to be class-
specific (described also for irbesartan alone and other AGII antagonists such as losartan). 
In the toxicological studies, the ratio of the doses of irbesartan/HCTZ was different from the ratio of 
the  recommended  therapeutic  dosage.  At  the  time  the  studies  were  initiated,  the  ratio  of 
irbesartan/HCTZ  to  be  used  for  the  clinical  dosage  form  was  not  yet  established.  The  doses  for  the 
toxicological studies with irbesartan/HCTZ combination were selected to detect additive or potentiated 
toxicological  effects  when  the  two  drugs  were  co-administered.  The  most  appropriate  dose  for 
irbesartan was decided first and thereafter, the most appropriate dose of HCTZ was added. 
Most of the treatment-related changes observed after repeated oral administration of irbesartan alone 
were  generally  evident  in  both  rats  and  macaques  at  90  mg/kg/day.  This  dose  was  15-times  the 
maximum human dose of 300 mg/day and corresponds to an exposure to irbesartan at least equal to 
that observed in humans. It was considered useful for identifying potential toxicological interactions 
between the two without undue risk of mortality. The 1/1 ratio was selected to allow for the maximal 
exposure  to  the  two  drugs  when  coadministered  and  maximises  the  chances  of  identifying  any 
interactions between the two drugs. This 1/1 ratio represents a conservative approach. Use of clinical 
ratios (12/1 and 24/1) would have resulted in HCTZ doses of only 7.5 or 3.75 mg/kg/day. Based on the 
fact  that  HCTZ  is  well  tolerated  in  animals,  it  was  decided  that  administration  of  HCTZ  at  90 
mg/kg/day would maximise the chances of observing a toxicological interaction. 
Digestive  tract  lesions  (stomach  discoloration,  ulcers  and  necrosis)  were  observed  in  rats  with  the 
irbesartan  90  mg/kg/day,  HCTZ  90  mg/kg/day  and  combination  (10/10  mg/kg/day  and  
90/90  mg/kg/day)  groups.  These  findings  were  not  observed  previously  in  studies  with  irbesartan 
alone at these dose levels. Relevant differences in the conduct of the studies may have accounted for 
the differences in the gastric lesions findings. These findings were further discussed by the company 
and the clarifications were considered acceptable.  
In a six-month oral toxicity study in macaques, drug-related changes were mild-to-moderate decreases 
in  blood  pressure  and  juxtaglomerular  hypertrophy/hyperplasia.  These  changes  were  attributable  to 
irbesartan. Changes seen only at 90/90 mg/kg/day of the combination were decreases in haemoglobin, 
erythrocytes  and  serum  sodium,  moderate  increase  in  serum  urea  nitrogen  and  mild  to  moderate 
increase in serum creatinine.  
Reproduction studies 
No  specific  fertility  studies  were  carried  out  with  the  irbesartan/HCTZ  combination  as  neither 
irbesartan  nor  HCTZ  have  revealed  evidence  of  adverse  effects  on  fertility  when  administered 
separately. Although another angiotensin-II antagonist (losartan) alone did not impair female fertility 
in rats, it did so following coadministration with HCTZ (the dose of HCTZ was smaller than that used 
in  irbesartan  studies).  This  change  was  not  attributable  to  maternal  toxicity.  Therefore  the  company 
also submitted a review of all available evidence of the effect of HCTZ on fertility. No adverse effects 
7 
                   EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
on  fertility  were  reported  in  mice  and  rats  of  either  sex  with  HCTZ  at  dose  levels  of  up  to  100 
mg/kg/day  and  4  mg/kg/day,  respectively.  Fertility  studies  with  four  fixed  combinations  medicinal 
products  containing  HCTZ  with  bisoprolol,  losartan,  metoprolol  and  reserpine  showed  that  with  the 
exception  of  losartan there  were no  adverse  effects  on fertility with these combination  products.  No 
toxicological  effects  on  the  gonads  were  observed  in  rats  and  macaques  with  irbesartan/HCTZ 
combination. 
Irbesartan administered during pregnancy has been shown to produce slight and reversible toxicity in 
rat foetuses, an increase in the incidence of resorptions in rabbits and a slight delay in weight gain of 
offspring during lactation.  
Irbesartan  was  shown  to  produce  no  teratogenic  effects.  Likewise,  HCTZ  was  tested  in  teratology 
studies in mice and rats and failed to demonstrate any adverse effects on the developing foetus. The 
teratogenic effects of irbesartan and HCTZ were studied when administered together or separately, to 
pregnant rats at doses of up to 150/150 mg/kg/day. This study revealed only slight maternal toxicity 
characterised by a reduction in the body weight gain together with a slight reduction in the weight of 
the foetuses within the group receiving the combination at a dosage level of 150/150 mg/kg. No other 
treatment-related  effects  were  observed  during  gestation  or  at  necropsy.  No  teratogenic  effects  were 
detected. 
Justification  provided  for  not  carrying  out  toxicity  studies  in  non-rodent  species  was  considered 
acceptable. Because only very low doses of medicinal products interacting with the renin angiotensin 
system in combination would be tolerated, rabbits  have seldom been used to  evaluate their potential 
teratogenic effect.  
The  reproduction  studies  did  not  reveal  any  additional  potential  toxicity  with  the  irbesartan/HCTZ 
combination. Nonetheless this combination is contraindicated during pregnancy and breast-feeding.  
Genotoxicity studies 
Irbesartan alone gave negative results in a battery of in vitro and in vivo tests. HCTZ gave ambiguous 
evidence of in vitro genotoxicity.  
HCTZ  brought  about  gene  mutations  in  mouse  lymphoma  cells  and  increased  sister  chromatid 
exchange in  Chinese  hamster cells  with  negative results in  other tests. The potential  genotoxicity of 
the  irbesartan/HCTZ  combination  was  studied  in  three  in  vitro  tests  (Ames  test,  gene  mutations  in 
Chinese  hamster  cells  and  cytogenetic  study  in  human  lymphocytes)  together  with  an  in  vivo  test 
(Micronucleus  in  the  mouse).  The  proportion  was  1/1  irbesartan/HCTZ  to  allow  the  maximum 
exposure  to  both  medicines  at  very  high  concentrations,  close  to  the  cytotoxicity  threshold  in  the in 
vitro  tests,  and  at  doses  up  to  2,000/2,000  mg/kg  in  the  in  vivo  Micronucleus  test.  Results  did  not 
indicate genotoxic effects of the combination.  
Although some experimental models have reported evidence of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity with 
HCTZ, there is no evidence of such effect in humans. 
Carcinogenicity studies 
No carcinogenic effects were reported in mice and rats receiving irbesartan at doses which represent a 
ratio  of  exposure  to  irbesartan  ranging  from  3.6  to  25  compared  to  humans  receiving  the  maximum 
dose of 300 mg/day.  
Equivocal  evidence  for  carcinogenic  effects  was  reported  with  HCTZ  in  rodent  carcinogenicity 
studies:  male mice  given high doses (i.e. approximately 600 mg/kg/day) of HCTZ for 2 years had  a 
slight increase in liver tumours. There was no evidence of an increase in tumours in female mice or 
rats  of  either  sex  given  HCTZ  for  2  years.  HCTZ  has  been  extensively  used  as  a  diuretic  and 
antihypertensive  agent  since  1957  at  doses  higher  than  that  to  be  used  in  the  irbesartan/HCTZ 
combination  and  despite  the  equivocal  nonclinical  findings,  there  has  been  no  evidence  of 
carcinogenicity in humans. 
No specific carcinogenicity study has been carried out with the irbesartan/HCTZ combination. There 
were  no  carcinogenic  effects  with  either  compound  when  administered  alone,  and  the  results  of  6-
month  studies  in  rats  and  macaques  with  the  combination  showed  no  significant  toxicological 
interactions  and  no  preneoplastic  lesions  suggesting  a  carcinogenic  effect  which  were  not  seen  with 
8 
                   EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
either  drug  alone.  The  conduct  of  a  specific  carcinogenicity  study  with  irbesartan  and  HCTZ  in 
combination would have therefore provided no additional information useful to the safety evaluation 
of the two drugs.  
Other studies 
No phototoxicity or photoallergy has been observed with irbesartan.  
Ecotoxicity/Environmental risk assessment 
The  use  of  irbesartan/HCTZ  combination  is  not  considered  to  have  hazardous  effects  on  the 
environment.  
4. 
Part IV: Clinical aspects 
The  clinical  development  program  included  a  total  of  over  2500  patients  with  mild  to  moderate 
hypertension  treated  with  irbesartan  and  HCTZ  in  combination,  including  over  600  elderly  patients 
and  121  patients with severe  hypertension. Aside from the long term  extensions, the duration of the 
studies ranged from 8 to 24 weeks. Studies with the combination in other special populations (patients 
with renal or hepatic impaired function) were not performed.  
Human pharmacology 
The  pharmacodynamics  and  pharmacokinetics  of  both  irbesartan  and  HCTZ  are  well  known. 
Therefore  only  a  very  limited  clinical  pharmacology program  involving  115  subjects  in  four  studies 
was conducted. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The  pharmacodynamic  profile  of  irbesartan  in  humans  has  been  established  through  single  and 
multiple-dose  studies  both  in  healthy  volunteers  and  hypertensive  patients.  These  studies  confirmed 
the blockade of angiotensin II receptors as the mechanism of action of irbesartan.  
HCTZ is a well known diuretic, widely used as antihypertensive agent that increases sodium, chloride, 
water and potassium excretion, and produces a mild but progressive volume contraction and secondary 
activation of the renin angiotensin system (RAS). The blood pressure lowering effects require several 
weeks to reach a maximum. 
One pharmacodynamic study evaluated the association of irbesartan and HCTZ (Study CV131-005). 
In  this  study,  25  mg  HCTZ  was  administered  to  patients  with  mild  to  moderate  hypertension  for  7 
days following the administration of 150 mg irbesartan over a 7 day period. The plasma levels of AII 
and PRA increased more with irbesratan/HCTZ than with irbesartan alone. The reductions in systolic 
blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were greater in the irbesartan/HCTZ group 
than in irbesartan/placebo group; the difference was statistically significant.  
Pharmacokinetics 
Study  CV131-005 was  a  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  trial  in  patients  with  mild  to 
moderate essential hypertension (seated DBP 95 to 110  mmHg) to compare the pharmacokinetics of 
irbesartan when coadministered with HCTZ vs. when administered alone.  
36 subjects were randomised to receive either irbesartan 150 mg for 7 days then irbesartan 150 mg and 
HCTZ 25 mg for 7 days, or irbesartan 150 mg for 7 days then irbesartan 150 mg and placebo for  7 
days.  
There  were  no  significant  differences  in  Cmax,  Tmax  and  AUC  of  irbesartan  following  irbesartan  and 
HCTZ for 7 days as compared to irbesartan and placebo for 7 days, when compared to the first 7 days 
of treatment in which each treatment group received only irbesartan. 
Study  CV131-123  was  a  2-way  crossover  study  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  irbesartan  on  the 
pharmacokinetics of HCTZ. Twenty healthy subjects (11 males and 9 females) were enrolled and 19 
completed  the  study.  Each  subject  received  a  single  12.5  mg  tablet  of  HCTZ  or  a  300/12.5  mg 
irbesartan/HCTZ  combination  tablet  according  to  a  randomisation  schedule.  All  parameters  were 
within limits of bioequivalence.  
9 
                   EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Coadministration  of  irbesartan  and  HCTZ  produced  the  expected  pharmacodynamic  effects  and 
demonstrated  that  the  agents  have  additive  antihypertensive  effects.  Concomitant  administration  of 
HCTZ and irbesartan has no effect on the pharmacokinetics of either drug. 
Study  CV131-069  was  a  single  centre,  open  label,  single  dose,  cross-over  study  to  investigate  the 
effect  of  food  on  the  oral  bioavailability  of  a  irbesartan/HCTZ  combination  tablet.  16  healthy  male 
volunteers received a single irbesartan/HCTZ (150 mg/12.5 mg) combination tablet under either fasted 
or fed conditions.  
When  the  combination  was  given  with  food,  a  statistically  significant  prolongation  of  Tmax  was 
observed for irbesartan. A decrease in Cmax and a prolongation of Tmax was observed for HCTZ when 
the combination was given with food. 
The  prolongation  of  Tmax  for  irbesartan  or  Tmax  and  Cmax  for  HCTZ  will  not  probably  have  clinical 
relevance in a multiple dose posology since the AUC does not change. 
Study CV131-054 was a single dose, open label, 2-way crossover study to assess the bioequivalence 
of the combination tablet of irbesartan/HCTZ (150 mg/12.5 mg) compared to the individual irbesartan 
150 mg capsule and HCTZ 12.5 mg tablet used in the clinical studies. 37 healthy male volunteers were 
randomised  to  receive  a  single  150  mg  dose  of  irbesartan  and  a  12.5  mg  dose  of  HCTZ  either  as  a 
combination tablet or as individual formulations following a 10 h fast on two separate occasions.  
The 90% confidence intervals (CI) for AUC and Cmax of the combination are within the accepted limits 
for  bioequivalence.  No  statistically  significant  differences  were  found  in  the  median  Tmax  values  of 
either irbesartan or HCTZ between the combination tablets and the reference. 
Study CV131-100 was a single dose, open label, 2-way crossover study to assess the bioequivalence 
of the intended commercial combination tablet of irbesartan/HCTZ (300 mg/12.5 mg) compared to the 
individual components, irbesartan (3x100 mg capsule) and HCTZ 12.5 mg tablet used in the clinical 
studies.  
The 90% confidence intervals for AUC and Cmax of the combination are within the accepted limits for 
bioequivalence. No statistically significant differences were found in the median Tmax values of either 
irbesartan or HCTZ between the combination tablets and the reference. However, the Tmax for HCTZ 
was higher for the combination tablet in comparison to the reference formulation. 
Clinical experience 
Efficacy 
Placebo-controlled studies 
All  placebo-controlled  studies  were  multicentre,  randomised,  double-blind  in  patients  with  mild-to 
moderate hypertension  
Study CV131-037 was a 4x4 factorial (16 cell) trial of multiple doses of irbesartan and HCTZ. The 
aim  of  the  study  was  to  assess  the  dose-relationship  in  blood  pressure  reduction  following  8  weeks 
administration  of  combinations  of  irbesartan  and  HCTZ.  The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the 
change from baseline in trough DBP. 
683  patients  were  randomised  for  8  weeks  to  receive  once  daily  treatment  with  one  of  the  different 
fixed  doses  of  the  combination  of  irbesartan  (37.5  mg,  100  mg,  300  mg  or  placebo  matching 
irbesartan) and HCTZ (6.25 mg, 12.5 mg, 25 mg or placebo matching HCTZ). 
The proportion of subjects with normalised DBP increased as a function of dose for the combination 
therapy,  the  irbesartan  monotherapy  and  the  HCTZ  monotherapy  groups.  In  patients  with  irbesartan 
100  mg/HCTZ  12.5  mg  treatment,  seDBP  was  reduced  by  11.9  mmHg  and  normalised  in  61  %  of 
patients, while in patients with irbesartan 300 mg treatment seDBP was reduced by 10.2 mmHg and 
normalised  in  49  %  of  patients.  However,  in  patients  receiving  irbesartan  300mg/HCTZ  12.5  mg, 
seDBP  reduction  was  the  highest,  15.0  mmHg  and  it  normalised  in  65  %  of  the  patients.  Placebo-
adjusted  trough-to-peak  ratios  for  seDBP  were  over  0.67  in  combination  regimens  with  HCTZ 
12.5 mg and lowest in irbesartan monotherapy groups, e.g. 0.54 in patients receiving irbesartan 37.5 
mg and 0.55 in patients receiving irbesartan 300 mg. The study had approximately 40 patients per cell, 
and was not powered to assess individual cells vs one another or vs placebo. The fact that the global 
10 
                   EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
statistical test was positive (p< 0.001) indicates that at least one combination dose produced larger BP 
reduction than either its components. 
Study  CV131-038  was  a  12-week  study  to  compare  two  combinations  of  irbesartan/HCTZ 
(75  mg/l2.5 mg  and  150  mg/12.5  mg)  with  their  individual  components  and  with  placebo  in  819 
patients.  
The  primary  endpoint  (change  from  baseline  of  trough  seDBP  at  week  12)  showed  statistically 
significant  reductions  over  placebo  in  all  active  treatment  groups.  The  combination  treatment 
demonstrated statistically significant reductions compared to its component treatment (p< 0.01). Only 
the combination doses produced blood pressure normalisations that differed statistically significantly 
from that of placebo (p<0.01).  
Irbesartan  150  mg/HCTZ  12.5  mg  combination  produced  a  placebo-adjusted,  mean  trough  seDBP 
reduction  of  2.3  mmHg  greater  than  irbesartan  150  mg  and  3.8  mmHg  greater  than  HCTZ  12.5  mg 
(combination vs. components, p< 0.01). 
Study  CV131-039  randomised  178  patients  to  receive  once  daily  combination  of  irbesartan 
75 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg, irbesartan 150 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg or placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint 
was the reduction in the mean 24-hour ambulatory diastolic blood pressure (ADBP) from baseline to 
the end of the 8 weeks period.  
Results  showed  statistically  significant  reductions  (p<0.01)  in  the  mean  24  hour  ADBP  and  ASBP 
daytime, in the trough 24th hour ADBP and ASBP and in the trough office seDBP and seSBP for both 
irbesartan/HCTZ groups compared with placebo.  
Add-on studies 
Study CV131-040 was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, and placebo controlled study in 238 
hypertensive  patients  not  adequately  controlled  (DBP  93-110  mmHg)  after  receiving  HCTZ  25  mg 
once daily for 4 weeks.  
Results showed statistically significantly greater reductions in trough and peak DBP and SBP at week 
12 with irbesartan/HCTZ compared to placebo/HCTZ.  
Study CV131-025 was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled study in patients 
with mild to moderate hypertension (DBP 95-110 mmHg). 319 patients were randomised for 8 weeks 
to  receive  once  daily  treatment  of  irbesartan  100  mg,  200  mg,  300  mg  or  placebo.  After  8  weeks, 
patients with seDBP = 90 mmHg were given, in addition to blinded study medication, HCTZ 12.5 mg 
for additional 2 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint was a change from baseline in trough DBP at 
week 8 of double-blind treatment.  
The proportion of subjects with normalisation of seDBP at week 8 to < 90 mmHg showed a 44%, 41% 
and 60% response, respectively, with irbesartan 100 mg, 200 mg and 300 mg. Placebo response was 
23%. In addition, in the subjects who were not well controlled at week 8, the addition of HCTZ 12.5 
mg  normalised,  at  week  10,  14%  (6/42)  of  the  subjects  already  treated  with  placebo,  27%  (8/30)  of 
those treated with irbesartan 100 mg, 30% (10/33)  of those treated with irbesartan 200 mg and 57% 
(12/21)  of  those  treated  with  irbesartan  300  mg.  However,  the  number  of  the  patients  in  this  period 
was too low (21 patients in the group of irbesartan 300 mg) and the duration of the treatment too short 
(2 weeks) to draw valid conclusions. 
Conclusions on placebo controlled studies 
Irbesartan  300  mg/HCTZ  12.5  mg,  irbesartan  150  mg/HCTZ  12.5  mg  and  irbesartan  75  mg/HCTZ 
12.5  mg  combination  doses  were  shown  to  be  significantly  more  effective  than  either  component 
alone.  The  placebo-subtracted,  mean  trough  blood  pressure  reduction  achieved  with  irbesartan 
150  mg/HCTZ  12.5  mg  was  12.9-18.0/6.9-9.6  mmHg  (CV131-038,  CV131-039).  With  this 
combination  dose,  blood  pressure  was  normalised  (seDBP  <90  mmHg)  in  56-69  %  of  the  patients. 
With irbesartan 150  mg, only 39 %  of the patients achieved normalisation. The trough-to-peak ratio 
for  seDBP  was  0.68  with  irbesartan  150  mg/HCTZ  12.5  mg  combination  treatment  and  0.64  with 
irbesartan 150 mg treatment. 
Irbesartan 300 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg produced reductions of 15.9/15.0 mmHg in trough blood pressure 
compared with reductions of 14.9/10.2 mmHg in the irbesartan 300 mg group and 8.9/6.2mmHg in the 
11 
                   EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
HCTZ 12.5 mg group (reductions of 2.3/3.5 mmHg in the placebo group). However, only 43 patients 
received  the  dose  of  irbesartan  300mg/HCTZ  12.5  mg  in  a  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-
controlled study (CV131-037) and there was no statistically significant evidence of its superiority to 
its components or to the lower combination dose of irbesartan 150 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg. 
The  effect  of  adding  irbesartan  or  HCTZ  to  patients  not  adequately  controlled  by  either  component 
alone was studied in trials CV131-025 and CV131-040. When HCTZ 12.5 mg was given in an open 
label  setting  as  an  adjunctive  treatment  to  patients  not  adequately  controlled  by  irbesartan  300  mg 
alone  (seDBP  =  90  mmHg),  further  decreases  in  the  mean  trough  blood  pressure  were  noticed. 
However,  only  21  patients  received  irbesartan  300  mg  followed  by  additional  HCTZ  12.5  mg  and, 
therefore, these results are only suggestive (CV131-025).  
Active controlled studies 
All active controlled studies were multicentre, randomised, and double-blind trials.  
Study CV 131-032 was an enalapril controlled study in subjects with severe hypertension (DBP 115-
130 mmHg). 182 patients were randomised to receive irbesartan 150 mg or enalapril 20 mg once daily 
for 12 weeks. 
The primary objective was to assess the change from baseline in trough DBP. The doses were doubled 
for patients with seDBP = 106 mmHg at the end of week 1 or seDBP = 90 mmHg at the end of week 
2.  Thereafter,  at  each  study  visit,  adjunctive  open-label  antihypertensive  therapy  (HCTZ  25  mg, 
followed by a long-acting nifedipine 30 mg titrated to 60 mg and/or atenolol 50 mg titrated to 100 mg) 
was added if seDBP was = 90 mmHg. Approximately 85 % of patients in both treatment groups were 
titrated to the second level (irbesartan 300 mg or enalapril 40 mg) plus HCTZ 25 mg by week 12, and 
most were receiving other adjunctive medications as well. 
Results showed that there was  no statistically significant difference between irbesartan and enalapril 
regimens. The percentage of patients on irbesartan in need of triple antihypertensive therapy was 58% 
while 68% of the patients randomised to enalapril required such additional treatment.  
This study  was not considered  supportive to the demonstration  of added benefit  of  300  mg/12.5  mg 
versus 300 mg, because the dose of HCTZ was 25 mg. 
Study  CV131-041  was  conducted  in  elderly  patients  (=65  years)  with  mild  to  moderate  essential 
hypertension  (seDBP  90-110  mmHg).  234  patients  were  randomised  for  a  treatment  duration  of  8 
weeks (with 24 weeks in the extension study) to receive either losartan 50 mg or irbesartan 75 mg or 
irbesartan  150  mg  (N=79),  each  in  combination  with  open  label  HCTZ  12.5  mg,  once  daily  for  24 
weeks. 
The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline in trough seDBP at week 8 of treatment.  
Results  showed that at  week  8 there were  no statistically  significant  differences  between  groups. At 
week 24, no statistically significant differences were observed. 
At  the  end  of  the  study  (week  24),  adjunctive  nifedipine  (predominantly  20  mg  daily)  was  used  by 
29%  of  the  losartan/HCTZ  group,  28%  of  the  irbesartan/HCTZ  75/12.5  group,  and  19%  of  the 
irbesartan/HCTZ  150/12.5  mg  group.  The  incremental  systolic/diastolic  blood  pressure  reductions 
amounted to 4-7/5-6 mmHg when nifedipine was added to irbesartan/HCTZ and 10/5 mmHg when it 
was added to losartan/HCTZ. A few subjects received add-on atenolol.  
Study  CV131-042  was  conducted  in  patients  with  severe  essential  hypertension  (seDBP  115-130 
mmHg). 207 patients were randomised for a duration of treatment of 12 weeks to receive once-daily 
oral  regimen  of  irbesartan  75  mg/HCTZ  12.5  mg,  irbesartan  150  mg/HCTZ  12.5mg  or  losartan 
50 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg. 
The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline in trough seDBP at week 12 of treatment. 
HCTZ was dispensed open-label. Patients who had seDBP = 106 mmHg at the end of the 1 week of 
double-blind study medication, or seDBP = 90 mmHg at the end of 2 weeks had their initial regimen 
dose  doubled  to  irbesartan  150  mg/HCTZ  25  mg,  irbesartan  300  mg/HCTZ  25  mg  or  losartan 
100 mg/HCTZ 25 mg. Thereafter, at each study visit (week 2, 4, 6, 8 and 10) the patients with seDBP 
=  90  mmHg  had  an  adjunctive  open-label  antihypertensive  therapy  (long-acting  nifedipine  30  mg 
titrated to 60 mg and/or atenolol 50 mg titrated to 100 mg) added as needed to normalised seDBP.

Results  showed  that  at  week  12  there  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  between  groups. 
However,  the  demographic  characteristics  were  slightly  different  between  irbesartan  and  losartan 
group.  Losartan  group  presented  a  higher  baseline  seDBP  and  a  lower  age,  and  more  women  than 
men.  
The proportion of patients requiring addition of nifedipine and/or atenolol was lowest in the irbesartan 
150  mg/HCTZ  group  (71%  vs.  87%  for  irbesartan  75  mg,  90%  for  losartan  50  mg/HCTZ).  The 
proportion  of  patients  in  whom  DBP  was  controlled  without  doubling  the  initial  dose  was  8%  for 
irbesartan  150  mg/HCTZ  and  0%  for  irbesartan  75  mg/HCTZ  and  losartan  50  mg/HCTZ.  However, 
this difference was not statistically significant. 
At  week  12,  most  patients  were  receiving  adjunctive  medication.  Approximately  equal  numbers  of 
subjects were receiving nifedipine or nifedipine plus atenolol, and a few (approx. 7%) of subjects were 
receiving add-on atenolol only. Nifedipine 30-60 mg resulted in substantial further BP reductions of 
10-18/9-12 mmHg when added to irbesartan/HCTZ, and 14/10 mmHg when added to losartan/HCTZ  
Study CV131-064 was a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active controlled study in 193patients 
with mild-to-moderate hypertension to compare irbesartan 75 mg and losartan 50mg during 8 weeks 
treatment  period. Both agents could  be  uptitrated  in  case of insufficient response to  150  mg and100 
mg, respectively. The primary efficacy endpoint was the change in trough seDBP. After the 8 weeks 
blinded  phase,  patients  who  had  seDPB  =  90mmHg  were  randomised  on  open  label  basis  to  either 
irbesartan 300mg or irbesartan 150mg+HCTZ 12.5mg. 
54 patients randomised to the open treatment phase completed the study. 29 subjects in the irbesartan 
75-150 mg group and 25 subjects in the losartan 50-100 mg group did not achieve a trough seDBP < 
90  mmHg  after  8  weeks  of  treatment.  These  patients  were  re-randomised  to  receive  open  label 
treatment  for  4  weeks  with  either  irbesartan  monotherapy  300  mg  or  irbesartan  150  mg/HCTZ 
12.5 mg. The seDBP was reduced in both groups by approximately 10mmHg. The differences in the 
change of trough seSBP or in the number of responders were not significant between the groups either. 
A  dose  increase  during  the  first  8  weeks  was  necessary  in  46%  and  44%  of  irbesartan  and  losartan 
treated patients,  respectively.  Therefore for patients  not  adequately controlled by  irbesartan 150  mg, 
the two alternative next steps, 150 mg/12.5 mg combination or continued monotherapy at an increased 
dose  of  300  mg  of  irbesartan,  provide  comparable  efficacy.  A  marginal  incremental  efficacy  of  the 
combination  irbesartan/HCTZ  150  mg/12.5  mg  over  irbesartan  300  mg  alone  was  observed.  The 
benefit of a back titration of irbesartan before adding HCTZ would be a less than optimal strategy for 
non-responders. 
The small sample size and small number of patients/centre prevents any firm conclusions. However, it 
is  interesting  to  note  that  irbesartan  150mg+HCTZ  12.5mg  seems  to  be  at  least  as  effective  as 
irbesartan 300mg. 
Compared  with  300  mg  and  100/12.5  mg  and  200/12.5  mg,  a  moderate  further  decrease  in  blood 
pressure is observed at 300/12.5 mg.  
Study  CV131-077  compared  irbesartan  and  amlodipine  based  regimens  in  patients  with  mild-to-
moderate hypertension. Patients received either irbesartan 150 mg or amlodipine 5 mg once daily. If 
trough seDBP was >90 mmHg at week 4, the dosage of study medication was doubled. At the end of 
week 8, if trough seDBP was still >90 mmHg, open-label HCTZ 12.5 mg was added for the remaining 
4  weeks.  Subjects  whose  seDBP  was  >90  mmHg  at  week  8  but  who  had  not  undergone  titration  at 
week 4 also received add-on HCTZ 12.5 mg. 
At  the  end  of  week  12,  add-on  HCTZ  was  taken  by  31/67  irbesartan  patients  (46%)  and  28/72 
amlodipine  patients  (39%),  of  whom  27  and  22  were  receiving  irbesartan  300  mg  and  amlodipine 
10 mg, respectively. From week 8 to week 12, in subjects who received add-on HCTZ the incremental 
decrease in seDBP was 7.3 mmHg in the irbesartan group and 3.6 mmHg in the amlodipine group. At 
the  same  time  point,  the  overall  normalisation  rate  with  the  regimen,  including  irbesartan/HCTZ 
300/12.5 mg, was similar to that seen with a regimen including the combination of amlodipine 10 mg 
and HCTZ 12.5 mg: 64% and 68%, respectively. 
In patients not normalised on irbesartan 300 mg alone, the additional normalisation provided by add-
on HCTZ 12.5 mg was observed in 15/27 patients (55%).

The proportion of non-responders to irbesartan 300 mg who responded to add-on HCTZ 12.5 mg was 
substantial in this small study. 
Study CV131-031 included 20 patients receiving HCTZ in addition to amlodipine 10 mg. 11 (55%) 
were  normalised  at  1  month.  Twenty-seven  (27)  patients  received  HCTZ  in  addition  to  irbesartan 
150 mg, of whom 12 (44%) were normalised at 1 month. 2 patients were not controlled by 75 and 300 
mg  of  irbesartan  and  were  normalised  after  adding  HCTZ.  The  number  of  patients  who  received 
HCTZ were too low to demonstrate the benefit of 300 mg/12.5 mg versus irbesartan 300 mg in this 
study.  
Study  CV131-027  compared  irbesartan  at  doses  up  to  150  mg  with  atenolol  at  doses  up  to  100  mg 
followed  by  the  addition  of  open-label  HCTZ  12.5  mg  in  non-responders.  The  proportion  of  non-
responders to irbesartan 150 mg who responded to add-on HCTZ 12.5 mg was 37 %. 
Conclusion on active controlled studies 
In  active-controlled  studies,  irbesartan  75mg/HCTZ  12.5  mg  and  irbesartan  150  mg/HCTZ  12.5  mg 
combinations were at least as effective as the losartan 50 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg combination dose in the 
treatment  of  elderly  patients  with  mild-to-moderate  hypertension  (CV  131-041).  In  the  treatment  of 
severe  hypertension  (seDBP  115-130  mmHg),  irbesartan  75  mg/HCTZ  12.5  mg  and  irbesartan 
150  mg/HCTZ  12.5  mg  combinations  were  as  effective  as  the  losartan  50  mg/HCTZ  12.5  mg 
combination  (CV131-042).  In  the  treatment  of  severe  hypertension  the  regimen  starting  with 
irbesartan 150 mg, gave comparable results with enalapril 20 mg (CV131-032). 
The  incremental  antihypertensive  efficacy  after  adding  beta-adrenergic  antagonists  or  long-acting 
calcium channel blockers to irbesartan/HCTZ were addressed in two controlled studies, several long-
term  extension  studies,  and  a  third  controlled  study  in  which  most  subjects  first  received  irbesartan 
plus  HCTZ.  These  studies  include  approximately  200  subjects  on  irbesartan/HCTZ  who  received 
atenolol, and approximately 300 subjects who received add-on nifedipine.  
The usefulness of adding a third treatment was assessed for patients who received add-on nifedipine 
and/or atenolol for BP control after 1 month. In the long-term extension combination studies, the dose 
of HCTZ was 25 mg, which is not the dose in the combination tablet, and in the long-term extension 
monotherapy  the  number  of  the  patients  was  low.  The  evidence  was  not  sufficient  to  recommend 
particular medicinal products to be added when the BP is not controlled with irbesartan/HCTZ . The 
fact  that  the  antihypertensive  effect  of  combination  of  irbesartan  and  HCTZ  (not  necessarily  at  the 
doses  of  irbesartan  300  mg/12.5  mg  and  irbesartan  150  mg/12.5  mg)  may  be  increased  with  the 
concomitant use of other antihypertensive agents is already mentioned in section 4.5 Interactions with 
other medicinal products of the Summary of Product Characteristics.  
Long- term extensions, open label studies 
Ten double blind studies were followed by open label long-term extensions. In seven studies (CV131-
002, CV131-025, CV131-027, CV131-028, CV131-029, CV131-01, CV131-050), subjects completing 
the  double-blind  period  had  the  option  of  enrolling  in  an  open  label  treatment  with  irbesartan  plus 
HCTZ and adjunctive treatment, if needed. One study in patients with severe hypertension (controlled 
with  enalapril)  was  also  conducted.  No  studies  on  the  effects  of  irbesartan/HCTZ  in  special 
populations (renal and hepatic impairment) were conducted.  
A  total  of  1542  patients  entered  the  long-term  open  label  phase  of  irbesartan/HCTZ  combination 
therapy  studies.  The  patient  population  included  293  elderly  (>65  years)  and  50  very  elderly  (>75 
years).  Of  the  1542  patients  entering  the  extensions,  195  patients  received  irbesartan/HCTZ  and  at 
least one adjunctive medication at any time during the extensions. Of the 1231 subjects seen at month 
12,  11%  were  receiving  further  adjunctive  medication,  predominantly  atenolol  and  long-acting 
nifedipine.  
All  subjects  received  initially  open  label  irbesartan/HCTZ  or  irbesartan  once  daily.  If  BP  was  not 
controlled,  the  initial  dose  of  irbesartan/HCTZ  or  irbesartan  could  be  increased;  in  the  irbesartan 
monotherapy  extensions,  HCTZ  was  added  next.  Thereafter,  once  daily  nifedipine  or  atenolol  were 
added  to  achieve  BP  control.  In  two  double-blind,  randomised  placebo-controlled  trials,  HCTZ  was 
added  in  non  responders  to  irbesartan  monotherapy.  The  double  blind  phase  of  study  CV131-032 
compared 2 titration schemes with irbesartan and enalapril in severely hypertensive subjects and was 
14 
                   EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
followed by an open-label irbesartan phase where HCTZ could be added.  
Regarding normalisation rates in studies allowing titration to irbesartan 300 mg, 83% of 821 patients 
seen  at  month  12  had  a  normalised  seDBP.  Of  these  normalised  subjects,  62%  were  on  irbesartan 
monotherapy and an additional 23% were on irbesartan/HCTZ only. 
From the patients randomised to the main studies with fixed irbesartan/HCTZ combinations (CV131-
037 and CV131-038), 67% and 78%, respectively, were recruited in the open label extension phases. 
Nine hundred out of 1098 patients completed the one year extension. Compared to the pre-treatment 
baseline, the mean change of seDBP ranged between -14.2mmHg and -15.7 mmHg at visits month 12. 
The  corresponding  range  for  seDBP  was  -19.l  mmHg  to  20.7  mmHg.  Sixty  two  percent  of  patients 
achieved a clinically significant blood pressure reduction with irbesartan 150 mg/HCTZ 12.5 or less. 
However, it should be noted that 11.4% of the patients had irbesartan 300mg/HCTZ 25mg and 11.8% 
of the patients had additional antihypertensive treatment. 
Safety 
A total of 3164 subjects were enrolled in the completed irbesartan/hydrochlorothiazide clinical trials. 
Of them, 2746 subjects were exposed to irbesartan and HCTZ in combination including 96 irbesartan 
treated  subjects  in  the  clinical  pharmacology  studies,  2650  irbesartan/HCTZ  treated  subjects  in  the 
clinical/efficacy studies, and additional 1202 subjects who received irbesartan/HCTZ for the first time 
in the long term, open label extension studies. 620 subjects were elderly subjects. 1542 patients (296 
elderly) were exposed for more than 6 months, and 968 subjects (178 elderly) for at least 1 year. In 
double-blind,  placebo-controlled  studies,  994  patients  received  an  irbesartan/HCTZ  combination.  A 
combination dose  of irbesartan 150  mg/HCTZ 12.5  mg or  more was received by 1770 patients. The 
exposure  time  was  at  least  6  months  for  897  patients  and  one  year  or  more  for  288  patients.  938 
patients received doses of irbesartan 300 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg or more. The exposure time to this dose 
was at least 6 months for 523 patients and at least one year for 111 patients. 
Various subgroups were represented in studies. These included 1049 women, 620 elderly (> 65 years), 
98 very elderly (> 75 years), 351 blacks and 259 patients in "other" racial groups.  
Placebo-controlled trials (CV131-037, CV131-038, CV131-039) 
The frequency of all adverse events (AE) was similar or slightly higher with irbesartan/HCTZ (59%) 
than with irbesartan alone (56%), HCTZ alone (58%) or placebo (53%). The AE were not related to 
the  dose  of  irbesartan/HCTZ  combination.  However,  the  incidence  of  three  AE  differed  statistically 
significantly  with  irbesartan/HCTZ  vs  placebo:  headache  (11.0%  vs  16.1%),  fatigue,  (6.5%  vs  3%) 
and  nausea/vomiting  (3.2%  vs  0.4%).  The  most  frequently  reported  AE  in  subjects  receiving 
irbesartan/HCTZ combination therapy occurred in the nervous (21.5%), respiratory (15.4%), general 
(14.0%),  gastrointestinal  (13.35%),  muskuloskeletal/connective  tissue  (12.2%)  and  cardiovascular 
(10.0%) systems. 
In  the  placebo  controlled  monotherapy  studies,  3.6%  of  irbesartan/HCTZ  treated  subjects,  3%  of 
irbesartan,  4.5%  of  HCTZ  and  6.8%  of  placebo  treated  subjects  discontinued.  Headache  (0.7%), 
dizziness  (0.7%),  and  rash  (0.6%)  were  the  more  common  reasons  for  discontinuation  in  the 
irbesartan/HCTZ group. 
Add-on studies 
In  studies  CV  131-040  and  CV  131-025,  there  was  some  evidence  that  the  addition  of  HCTZ  or 
irbesartan to high dose of irbesartan or HCTZ produced a small increase in AE. Headache, dizziness, 
fatigue and nausea were the most common AE in patients receiving combination treatment (CV131-
040). However, the events were mild and did not cause discontinuation of drug therapy. 
Active controlled trials 
In the three active-controlled studies (CV13I-041, CV131-042, CV131-032), the overall incidences of 
AE were similar with irbesartan/HCTZ treatment compared with losartan/HCTZ treatment.  
Long term extensions 
The  AE  profile  of  patients  treated  with  irbesartan/HCTZ  in  the  long-term  extensions  was  similar  to 
that seen during the blinded controlled study periods. One case of lymphoma was reported in which a

causal  relationship  with  irbesartan  or  irbesartan/HCTZ  could  not  be  excluded  with  certainty.  This 
issue will be addressed in forthcoming PSURs. 
Discontinuations and deaths 
Discontinuations  of  study  drug  treatment  for  AE  occurred  in  3.6  %  of  the  patients  with 
irbesartan/HCTZ treatment, in 3.0 % of the patients with irbesartan treatment, in 4.5 % of the patients 
with  HCTZ  treatment  and  in  6.8  %  of  the  patients  randomised  to  placebo  treatment  in  placebo-
controlled  monotherapy  short-term  trials.  The  difference  in  favour  of  irbesartan/HCTZ  over  placebo 
was  statistically  significant  (p=0.023).  The  most  common  reasons  for  discontinuing  treatment  were 
cardiovascular events, fatigue, headache, dizziness, and rash. 
In the active controlled trials, the discontinuation rate for irbesartan/HCTZ was 3.9% compared with 
7.5% for the losartan combination. The discontinuation rate during long term therapy was somewhat 
higher  (7.7%)  because  the  exposure  was  about  three  times  longer  than  that  during  double-blind 
studies. 
A  total  of  11  deaths  occurred  in  hypertension  studies,  9  on  irbesartan/HCTZ  or  irbesartan  and  2  on 
control group (including long-term extensions). 4 deaths occurred in the short-term phases of placebo-
controlled  and  active-controlled  trials.  All  deaths  were  sudden  or  cardiac  deaths,  and  considered 
unrelated  to  study  drug  treatment.  The  7  deaths  which  occurred  in  the  open-label  long-term 
extensions, were also considered unrelated to irbesartan/HCTZ treatment. 
Serious adverse events 
The incidence of serious AE (SAE) was low, 1.3 % in patients treated with irbesartan/HCTZ, 1.2 % in 
patients  treated  with  HCTZ  and  0.4  %  in  patients  treated  with  placebo.  None  of  the  SAE  was 
attributed to study drug. 
There  seemed  to  be  a  trend  towards  more  cardiovascular  AE  with  irbesartan/HCTZ  and  the  active 
comparators  for  serious  cardiovascular  AE-related  withdrawals.  The  395  subjects  receiving 
irbesartan/HCTZ  in  the  active-controlled  studies  experienced  54  (13.7%)  cardiovascular  AE,  and  5 
subjects  (1.3%)  SAE.  The  200  subjects  receiving  active  comparator/HCTZ  experienced  27  (13.5%) 
cardiovascular AE, but there were no SAE. The SAE in the irbesartan/HCTZ treated patients included 
atrial  rhythm  disturbance,  angina  pectoris  (history  of  CHD),  syncope  (history  of  aortic  stenosis), 
myocardial  infarction  in  a  patient  with  CHD,  and  sudden  death.  All  SAE  were  considered  to  be 
unrelated to study medication by the investigator or both by the investigator and the company. Four of 
the 5 subjects were withdrawn from study due to the SAE.  
The causality assessment in the case of syncope may be debated because the severity of aortic stenosis 
was  unknown.  Special  precaution  should  be  however  paid  in  patients  with  aortic  stenosis,  because 
vasodilatation  induced  by  irbesartan  may  lead  to  syncope  in  a  patient  with  clinically  important 
stenosis.  
The occasional serious cardiovascular AE reported in the irbesartan/HCTZ group are not unexpected 
for this patient population with underlying cardiovascular disease. The overall incidence is low and no 
more  than  one  event  of  a  specific  type  occurred.  Cardiovascular  safety  data  will  be  updated  in 
forthcoming PSURs. 
Laboratory changes 
the  observed  marked 
Laboratory  tests  did  not  reveal  frequent  marked  abnormalities  in  placebo-controlled  studies. 
Moreover, 
laboratory  abnormalities  occurred  at  similar  rates  with 
irbesartan/HCTZ  and  placebo.  In  placebo-controlled  studies,  the  mean  changes  from  the  baseline  in 
laboratory analyses showed expected dose-related changes with HCTZ, i.e., decreases in sodium and 
potassium,  and  increases  in  blood  urea  nitrogen,  uric  acid,  glucose,  cholesterol  and  triglycerides. 
When HCTZ was given in combination with irbesartan, there was a statistically significant decrease 
(at week 8) in mean plasma potassium and sodium and blood haemoglobin concentrations as well as a 
statistically significant increase in plasma BUN and uric acid concentrations. However, compared to 
HCTZ alone, the changes in plasma potassium, glucose and cholesterol tended to be slightly blunted in 
patients treated with irbesartan/HCTZ combination.  
16 
                   EMEA 2004 
 
 
 
 
 
Four  patients  had  marked  hyponatremia  during  the  blinded  phases  of  the  controlled  studies.  The 
reported cases of hyponatremia (and concomitant hypokalaemia) can be attributed to HCTZ. None of 
the electrolyte abnormalities were severe or symptomatic. 
A  review  of  clinical  data  revealed  21  subjects  with  CK  levels  that  met  marked  abnormality  criteria 
(>4x pre-treatment) while receiving irbesartan/HCTZ therapy. The review did not suggest an apparent 
association  with  irbesartan/HCTZ  or  an  interaction  with  other  concomitant  medications,  including 
statins.

 Overall conclusions and benefit/risk assessment 
Quality 
The pharmaceutical and chemical part of the dossier is acceptable.  
Preclinical safety 
Studies with the combination of irbesartan and HCTZ are considered well designed although some did 
not  comply  with  GLP.  Although  the  additive  antihypertensive  effect  of  the  combination  was 
convincingly demonstrated only in spontaneously hypertensive rats, the doses selected and the ratio of 
doses of irbesartan and HCTZ were considered adequate. 
The  pharmacokinetic  data  in  animals  for  the  separate  species  are  scant  but  it  must  be  taken  into 
account  that  both  substances  are  used  in  therapy  for  humans  and  that  sufficient  toxicokinetic  trials 
were carried out with the association of irbesartan/HCTZ.  
The  results  of  the  pre-clinical  safety  assessment  of  the  studies  with  irbesartan  and  HCTZ  in 
combination did not show relevant toxicological interactions between these two drugs. 
The  reproduction  studies  did  not  reveal  any  additional  potential  toxicity  with  the  irbesartan/HCTZ 
combination. Nonetheless this combination is contraindicated during pregnancy and breast-feeding. 
Although  some  experimental  models 
carcinogenicity with HCTZ, there is no evidence of such effects in humans. 
reported  ambiguous  evidence  of  genotoxicity  and 
Clinical efficacy 
In  three  placebo-controlled  double-blind  studies  (CV131-037,  CV131-038,  CV131-40)  different 
combination doses of irbesartan (37.5 mg - 300 mg) and HCTZ (6.25 mg-25 mg) were administered 
once  daily  to  patients  with  mild-to-moderate  hypertension  for  8-12  weeks.  In  general,  there  was  a 
tendency to achieve more pronounced blood pressure reductions with increased doses of each drug. It 
was  shown  that  a  significantly  greater  reduction  in  blood  pressure  with  the  combination  tablets  vs. 
their components was achieved with irbesartan 150 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg and irbesartan 300 mg/HCTZ 
12.5 mg. 
The two combinations of irbesartan/HCTZ (150/12.5 and 300/12.5 mg) have not been compared in a 
head-to-head  study.  However,  the  dose-response  relationship  regarding  BP  decrease  with  irbesartan 
alone is retained with the combination according to data combined from several studies. 
During the oral explanation, the applicant presented an overview of data which support the efficacy of 
both  combinations  (150/12.5  and  300/12.5  mg)  as  compared  to  their  components.  The  CPMP  also 
considered that both combinations may facilitate flexibility in treatment. 
In  active-controlled  studies,  irbesartan  75mg/HCTZ  12.5  mg  and  irbesartan  150  mg/HCTZ  12.5  mg 
combinations were at least as effective as the losartan 50 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg combination dose in the 
treatment  of  elderly  patients  with  mild-to-moderate  hypertension.  In  the  treatment  of  severe 
hypertension,  irbesartan 75  mg/HCTZ  12.5  mg and  irbesartan 150  mg/HCTZ  12.5  mg  combinations 
were as effective as the losartan 50 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg combination. In severe hypertensive patients 
the regimen starting with irbesartan 150 mg gave comparable results with enalapril 20 mg. 
Clinical safety 
In  the  clinical  development  program,  1770  subjects  were  exposed  to  150/12.5  mg  or  above,  with 
nearly 900 exposed for 6 months and 288 for at least 1 year. At the 300/12.5 mg dose level or above, 
938 subjects were exposed, with 523 exposed for at least 6 months and 111 for at least 1 year. Over 
400 elderly subjects received doses of at least 150/12.5 mg and over 200 received 300/12.5 or more.

The overall program did not raise any safety concern, whatever the dose or the duration of treatment. 
The incidence of SAE was low and consistent with the population under investigation. No deaths were 
attributed  to  the  combination.  In  double-blind  studies,  SAE  occurred  with  similar  frequencies  in 
irbesartan/HCTZ treated subjects, in monotherapy-treated subjects and in placebo-treated subjects. 
Dose-related laboratory changes with HCTZ were evident in major trials, i.e. decreases in sodium and 
potassium and increases in BUN, uric acid, glucose, cholesterol and triglycerides. Irbesartan tended to 
ameliorate  the  HCTZ  related  changes  in  plasma  glucose  and  cholesterol,  and  the  hypokalemic  and 
hyperuricemic effects of HCTZ 12.5 mg were most evenly balanced by the 150 mg and 300 mg doses 
of irbesartan. 
Irbesartan/HCTZ  was  generally  well  tolerated.  The  frequency  of  all  AE  was  similar  with 
irbesartan/HCTZ  (59%)  than  with  irbesartan  alone  (56%),  HCTZ  alone  (58%)  or  placebo  (53%). 
However,  the  incidence  of  three  AE  differed  statistically  significantly  with  irbesartan/HCTZ  vs 
placebo:  headache  (11.0%  vs  16.1%),  fatigue  (6.5%  vs  3%)  and  nausea/vomiting  (3.2%  vs  0.4%). 
Orthostatic  dizziness  or  hypotension  occurred  in  1.6  %  of  the  patients  with  irbesartan/HCTZ 
treatment, in 1.0 % with irbesartan treatment, in 0.8 % with HCTZ treatment and 0.4 % with placebo 
treatment.  
Benefit/risk assessment 
The  benefit/risk  assessment  for  the  fixed  combinations  of  irbesartan  150  mg/HCTZ  12.5  mg  and 
irbesartan 300 mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg is considered favourable. Marketing authorisation is recommended.

Pregnancy 
Thiazides  cross  the  placental  barrier  and  appear  in  cord  blood.  They  may  cause  decreased  placental 
perfusion  and  foetal  electrolyte  disturbances.  Cases  of  neonatal  thrombocytopenia  and  foetal  or 
neonatal jaundice have been reported with maternal thiazide therapy. Since Karvezide contains HCTZ, 
it  is  not  recommended  during  the  first  trimester  of  pregnancy.  A  switch  to  a  suitable  alternative 
treatment should be carried out in advance of a planned pregnancy. 
In  the  second  and  third  trimesters,  substances  that  act  directly  on  the  renin-angiotensin-system  can 
cause  foetal  or  neonatal  renal  failure,  foetal  skull  hypoplasia  and  even  foetal  death,  therefore 
Karvezide  is  contra-indicated  in  the  second  and  third  trimesters  of  pregnancy.  If  pregnancy  is 
diagnosed, Karvezide should be discontinued as soon as possible and foetal skull and renal function 
should be checked with echography if, inadvertently, the treatment has been taken for a long period.  
Interaction with other medicinal products 
Cases  of  potential  interaction  with  lithium  have  been  reported.  The  combination  of  lithium  and 
Karvezide  is  not  recommended.  If  the  combination  proves  necessary,  careful  monitoring  of  serum 
lithium levels is recommended during concomitant use. 
As  with  ACE  inhibitors,  concomitant  use  of  AIIRAs  and  NSAIDs  may  lead  to  an  increased  risk  of 
worsening  of  renal  function,  including  possible  acute  renal  failure,  and  an  increase  in  serum 
potassium,  especially  in  patients  with  poor  pre-existing  renal  function.  The  combination  should  be 
administered  with  caution,  especially  in  the  elderly.  Patients  should  be  adequately  hydrated  and 
consideration should be given to monitoring renal function after initiation of concomitant therapy, and 
periodically thereafter. 
Adequate monitoring of serum potassium in patients at risk is recommended 
Side effects 
Cases of cough and dysgeusia have been reported very rarely with irbesartan.

Post authorisation: new irbesartan 300 mg/HCTZ 25 mg dose 
7.1 
Introduction 
The  current  approved  posology  includes  irbesartan  150  mg/HCTZ  12.5  mg  and  300/12.5mg  doses. 
The  MAH  applied  to  amend  the  Posology  section  of  the  SPC  and  PL  to  include  a  300/25  mg  dose 
(2x150mg/12.5mg) as a treatment alternative if hypertensive patients are uncontrolled on lower doses 
or monotherapy. 
Rationale 
Current treatment guidelines on hypertension outline a “titration to full dose before adding new drugs” 
strategy as one recommended way of getting hypertensive patients to target. Keeping patients on well-
tolerated  combinations  is  therefore  of  great  importance,  since  adding  a  third  drug  from  another 
the 
top  of  an  existing  dual  combination,  will 
therapeutic  class,  on 
pharmacodynamic complexity, with possible drug-drug interactions as a result.  
inevitably 
increase 
In  addition  to  these  clinical  recommendations,  it  is  also  important  to  consider  the  actual  prescribing 
pattern of HCTZ with or without irbesartan. Nowadays, the most prescribed dose of HCTZ is 25 mg. 
Due to the common use of this dose it is important to provide guidance in the SmPC as to the safety 
and efficacy of combining irbesartan 300 mg and HCTZ 25 mg. 
7.2  Clinical aspects 
Six  clinical  trials  have  been  conducted  to  provide  efficacy  and  safety  data  on  the  300/25  mg 
combination:  3  controlled  parallel  group  studies  (CV131-032,  CV131-037  and  CV131-042)  and  3 
open label studies (Combo LT, Mono LT and a study by Coca et al). 
Further to a request from CHMP regarding the incremental efficacy of the proposed 300/25 mg dose 
over  the  existing  300/12.5mg  dose  and  possible  titration  recommendations,  the  MAH  has  submitted 
the results of trial CV131052, which was not included in the initial variation application. Although the 
primary  endpoint  was  not  BP  lowering  efficacy,  the  results  of  the  trial  provide  important  additional 
information.  
Methods 
•  Controlled Parallel Group Studies  
Study CV131-037 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled, 4x4 factorial (16 cell) trial in 
subjects with mild to moderate essential hypertension (SeDBP 95mm - 110 mm Hg) to assess the dose 
response  efficacy  and  safety/tolerability  of  irbesartan  and  HCTZ  mono  and  combination  treatments 
during an 8-week follow up. Following a 4 to 5-week single-blind placebo lead-in period, 687 subjects 
were randomised to receive one of 16 different doses of the combination of irbesartan (37.5, 100 and 
300 mg or placebo matching irbesartan) and HCTZ (6.25, 12.5 and 25 mg or placebo matching HCTZ) 
during  8  weeks  of  double-blind,  parallel-group  treatment.  Subjects  completing  the  double-blind 
portion were eligible for enrollment into an optional long-term open-label extension period. The study 
included  ~ 40  subjects/cell.  The  main  inclusion  criteria  were  consenting  males  and  females  with  no 
child-bearing potential, aged 18 years or greater, with mild to moderate essential hypertension (SeDBP 
95-110  mmHg).  The  main  endpoint  was  the  change  from  baseline  in  trough  seated  diastolic  blood 
pressure (SeDBP) at week 8 of double blind treatment. Secondary endpoints were the effects on serum 
potassium and fasting lipid concentrations. 
Study  CV131-042  was  a  multicentre  double-blind,  randomised,  controlled  parallel  group  trial  in 
patients  with  severe  hypertension  (SeDBP  115-130  mm  Hg)  to  compare  the  efficacy  and  safety  of 
irbesartan  +  HCTZ  with  losartan  +  HCTZ.  After  a  maximum  of  7  days  lead-in,  patients  were 
randomised 1:1:1 to receive either irbesartan 75 mg + open label HCTZ 12.5 mg (N=67), irbesartan 
150 mg + open label HCTZ 12.5 mg (N=72) or losartan 50 mg + open label 12.5 mg HCTZ (N=68).

The doses were doubled after 1 week to irbesartan/HCTZ 150/25 mg, 300/25 mg or losartan 100/25 
mg,  respectively,  if  SeDBP  ≥106  mm  Hg,  or  after  2  weeks  if  SeDBP  >90  mm  Hg.  Patients  were 
followed  up  for  12  weeks.  Open-label  adjunctive  treatment  was  allowed  if  patients  did  not  reach 
treatment  goals  after  maximum  doses  of  treatment  drugs.  The  primary  endpoint  measurement  was 
trough SeDBP after 12 weeks. Secondary endpoints included SeSBP at 12 weeks, SeDBP and SeSBP 
after 2 weeks, the number of patients reaching treatment goals (SeDBP < 90 mm Hg), and SeHR at 12 
weeks  and  finally  to  ascertain  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  the  studied  combinations  during  the  12 
weeks. Blood and urine samples were collected for analysis (Haemoglobin, creatinine, BUN, glucose, 
potassium and uric acid). 
Study  CV131-032  was  a  randomised,  double-blind  parallel  group,  active-controlled  study  in  patients 
with severe hypertension (SeDBP 115-130 mm Hg) investigating the efficacy of an irbesartan-based 
regimen vs an enalapril-based regimen. The primary endpoint was to compare the reduction in trough 
SeDBP from baseline following 12 weeks of a once-daily oral regimen beginning with irbesartan 150 
mg vs a regimen beginning with enalapril 20 mg. Placebo lead-in ranged from 1-7 days. Subjects were 
randomised 2 irbesartan:1 enalapril. Subjects with SeDBP > 105 mm Hg at week 1 or > 90 at week 2 
received  a  double  dose  of  irbesartan  or  enalapril  (300  mg  and  40  mg,  respectively).  Subjects  with 
SeDBP > 90 mm Hg at week 4, 6, 8 or 10 were given additional 25 mg HCTZ. If still uncontrolled, 
additional  medication  was  allowed  (nifedipine  and  atenolol).  Secondary  endpoints  were  SeSBP  at 
week 12, standing SBP and DBP at 12 weeks, trough SeSBP and SeDBP at week 4, peak BP at 1 day, 
4 weeks and  12 weeks, the proportion  of normalised patients  (SeDBP <  90  mm  Hg and/or  decrease 
>10 mm Hg in SeDBP), the proportions of patients controlled or responding (>10 mm Hg SeDBP) in 
those receiveing monotherapy, study medication + HCTZ 25 mg or triple therapy at week 12, and the 
safety and tolerability after 12 weeks of treatment with the irbesartan and enalapril regimens. 
•  Study CV131052  
A  multi-centre,  randomised,  double  blind  trial  comparing  the  structural  and  functional  CV  efficacy 
and safety of an irbesartan-based regimen with an atenolol-based regimen. The primary objective was 
to compare the change in left ventricular mass index (LVMI) from  baseline in hypertensive patients 
with  left  ventricular  hypertrophy  (LVH)  after  24  and  48  weeks  of  irbesartan  150  mg  once  daily 
(electively titrated to 300 mg, 300/12.5 HCTZ, 300/25 HCTZ, 300/25HCTZ + adjunctive medication) 
versus an atenolol-based regimen. Eligible patients were those with LVMI >131 (men) and >100 g/m2 
(women) and SeDBP of 90-115 mm Hg.  
• 
Open-Label Studies 
The  Mono  LT  study  was  an  integrated  pooled  analysis  of  open-label  long-term  follow  up  trials  of  7 
double-blind, randomised placebo or active controlled trials (CV131-002 ,025, 027, 028, 029, 031 and 
050 LT). Although the trials were conducted separately, data have been integrated and presented in a 
single  report  due  to  the  population  similarity.  A  total  of  1,545  of  the  2,053  subjects  included  in  the 
double-blind randomised trials were included in the open label extensions. 
Patients were started at 75 or  150  mg irbesartan  directly after the double-blind treatment period and 
titrated to 300 mg. If normalised BP (<140/90mm Hg) was not achieved with irbesartan 300 mg alone, 
adjunctive medication with HCTZ (12.5, 25 and 50 mg/day) was added (all trials except CV131-028). 
If patients were still uncontrolled, amlodipine, nifedipine and atenolol as adjunctive medication were 
allowed. The primary objective was to ascertain the safety and tolerability of irbesartan during long-
term administration. The secondary endpoints were to ascertain the safety and tolerability of irbesartan 
in combination with adjunctive medication and to monitor the long term efficacy of irbesartan-based 
regimens in subjects with hypertension. 
The  Combo  LT  study  was  a  long-term  open-label  follow  up  of  1,098  patients  completing  two 
randomised, double-blind trials (CV131-037, 038) of irbesartan alone, HCTZ alone, irbesartan/HCTZ 
combinations, or placebo) in which the tolerability and efficacy of the combination of irbesartan and 
HCTZ  was  assessed.  Patients  received  1  year  of  open-label  therapy  starting  with  irbesartan  75 
mg/HCTZ 12.5 mg once daily. If target BP (<140/<90 mm Hg) was not achieved, the dose was titrated 
sequentially  at  2-  to  4-week  intervals  to  irbesartan  150  mg/HCTZ  12.5  mg,  then  (at  12  weeks)  to 
irbesartan 300 mg/HCTZ 25 mg. If necessary, adjunctive therapies were added.

The study by Coca et al was a single-arm, open-label trial in hypertensive Caucasian patients aged 45-
78  years  (mean  60.4±7.2)  recruited  consecutively  from  the  outpatient  hypertension  clinics  of  3 
reference  hospitals  in  Spain.  Patients  had  previously  treated  and  uncontrolled  essential  hypertension 
(clinic  BP  ≥140/90  mmHg)  with  high  doses  of  a  single  antihypertensive  drug  or  with  low-dose 
combination therapy for more than 2 months. After a 1-week wash-out period, 57 patients (28 males 
and  29  females)  with  a  mean  daytime-BP  higher  than  135/85  mm  Hg  were  treated  with  irbesartan 
300/HCTZ  25  once  daily  for  12  weeks.  BP  was  monitored  at  the  end  of  the  wash-out  period  and 
during the last week of  treatment.  BP  changes were assessed by 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure 
monitoring (ABPM) during normal daily activity (daytime period) and sleep (night time period). 
Results 
Efficacy 
Study CV131-037 
Larger mean reductions from baseline in both SeDBP and SeSBP were observed with increasing doses 
of the combination treatment. The proportion of subjects normalised increased as a function of dose 
for  the  combination  therapy  and  for  the  irbesartan  and  HCTZ  monotherapy  groups  (from  16%  with 
placebo to 68% with irbesartan 300 mg/HCTZ 25 mg). The response rate ranged from 24% to 80% in 
the placebo and irbesartan 100 mg/HCTZ 25 mg groups respectively, as seen in the table below.

The absolute trough SBP and DBP reductions from baseline for the 300/25 mg combination were 23.1 
and 14.4 mm Hg, respectively. The corresponding values for the 100/12.5 mg combination were 14.9 
and 11.9 mm Hg, respectively. The additional SeSBP reduction of 300/25 mg compared with 300/12.5 
mg was 7.2 mm Hg, while the decrease in DBP was virtually similar between the two groups.

However, the response surface model analysis of predicted change in SeDBP at week 8 shown below, 
predicted  additive  effects  of  irbesartan  +  HCTZ.  Predicted  BP  effect  at  each  combination  dose  of 
HCTZ (range 0-25 mg) and irbesartan (range 0-300 mg) can be interpolated from the graph, showing a 
direct relationship between BP decrease and combination dose. The response surface model for trough 
Se SBP showed a similar pattern.

In  patients  receiving  the  300/25  mg  an  additional  SeSBP  reduction  was  observed  compared  with 
patients  receiving  300/12.5  mg.  Nonetheless,  the  proportions  of  normalised  patients  and  responders 
are similar in 300/12.5 and 300/25 mg dose regimen (65-79% and 68-76% respectively) and the only 
difference  found  between  both  doses  is  a  SBP  decrease  of  -7.1  mmHg  obtained  with  300/25  mg 
regimen.  
Although  the  response  surface  model  predicts  an  incremental  SeSBP  and  SeDBP  decrease  from 
300/12.5 mg to 300/25 mg, the observed (as opposed to predicted) mean reduction in DBP was similar 
for both combinations. 
Study CV131-042 
There were no significant differences among the groups in the baseline characteristics, although there 
was a slight imbalance in gender and elderly age categories for baseline demographics. 
All  3  treatment  regimens  reduced  SeDPB  by  29-31  mmHg  and  SeSBP  by  44-45  mmHg  after  12 
weeks.  The  BP  reduction  was  greatest  in  the  high  dose  irbesartan/HCTZ  group,  but  the  differences 
among  the  groups  were  not  significant.  The  proportions  of  normalised  patients  were  63%,  72%  and 
74%  for  the  losartan/HCTZ,  irbesartan  75  mg/HCTZ  group  and  irbesartan  150  mg/HCTZ  groups, 
respectively.  The  differences  in  normalised  patients  at  week  12  were  not  statistically  significant. 
Almost all of the subjects in each group were classified as total responders at week 12.

Of  the  patients  who  received  higher  doses  of  irbesartan  and  HCTZ  (up  to  300/25  mg  respectively), 
29% did not need any adjuvant medication. In the low dose irbesartan/HCTZ regimen (doses up to 150 
mg  irbesartan  and  25  mg  HCTZ)  only  14%  managed  without  adjuvant  medication.  The  need  for 
adjuvant medication was even greater in the losartan/HCTZ group (only 10% of the subjects without 
adjunctive medication). Titration to 300/25 mg irbesartan/HCTZ was necessary between week 1 and 
week 2 in 57% of subjects receiving initial 150/12.5 mg irbesartan/HCTZ, resulting in a further 7.0/5.2 
mmHg SeSBP/SeDBP reduction. After 12 weeks only 5 of 62 subjects (8%) were still on the original 
150/12.5 mg irbesartan/HCTZ while 57 patients received 300/25 mg irbesartan/HCTZ either alone or 
with adjuvant medication 
Assuming  that  at  the  end  of  the  trial  all  patients  were  well  controlled  and  that  up-tritation  stopped 
when  adequate  control  was  reached,  it  would  appear  that  94  out  of  120  patients  (considering  the  2 
irbesartan treated arms of the study together) were not controlled with the combination proposed (i.e. 
they  needed  additional  drugs).  Of  the  26  that  were  controlled  with  irbesartan/HCTZ,  none  were 
controlled with 75/12.5, 5 were controlled with 150/12.5, 8 were controlled with 150/25 and 13 with 
300/25.  It  is  confirmed  that  300/25  is  more  useful  than  150/12.5.  It  would  be  useful  to  know  if  the 
same result could have been obtained with 300/12.5, which is the currently approved combination and 
which was surprisingly not included in the up-titration schedule.  
Study CV131-032 
There  were  no  statistically  significant  differences  in  baseline  demographic  characteristics  or  BP 
between the two treatment groups. There was no significant difference between the enalapril and the 
irbesartan-based regimens in mean SeDBP change from baseline at week 12 (29.6 vs 30.5 mmHg for 
irbesartan and enalapril respectively). The SeSBP reductions were 40.1 and 39.3 mm Hg respectively. 
The proportion of subjects normalised after 12 weeks did not differ significantly between the groups 
(59%  vs.  57%  for  the  irbesartan  and  enalapril  groups).  However,  subjects  tended  to  achieve 
normalisation earlier with the irbesartan regimen. Peak SeSBP reductions at 12 weeks were 47.2 mm 
Hg (irbesartan) and 44.5 mm Hg (enalapril).

Titration categories at week 12 are presented in table below. At week 2, none of the subjects received 
irbesartan in combination with HCTZ. Between week 2 and week 4, 57 patients (52%) of the subjects 
in the irbesartan arm received the combination of irbesartan 300mg + HCTZ 25 mg. At 12 weeks only 
9  patients  were  still  on  irbesartan  monotherapy  (8.8%).  Twenty-five  patients  (24.3%)  received 
irbesartan + HCTZ 25 mg.

An  irbesartan-based  regimen  with  a  starting  dose  of  150  mg  titrated  to  300  mg,  300/25  mg  and 
adjunctive  medication  proved  to  be  as  effective  in  lowering  BP  as  an  enalapril-based  regimen.  The 
irbesartan-based regimen appears safe and well tolerated. The addition of 25 mg HCTZ to irbesartan 
provided incremental SeSBP and SeDBP BP reductions. 
It  can  be  concluded  that  the  300/25  combination  is  more  useful  than  irbesartan  monotherapy  in 
lowering BP. Unfortunately, the 300/12.5 titration step was not included in the study and, therefore, no 
comparative data between the the 300/25 mg and the 300/12.5 mg doses has been obtained. 
Study CV131-052 
The  results  of  the  primary  endpoint  will  not  be  discussed,  but  rather  the  incremental  BP  effects 
observed in the subset of patients who added 12.5 mg HCTZ to either 300/12.5 irbesartan/HCTZ (n = 
22)  or  100/12.5  mg  atenolol/HCTZ  (n  =  16).  Table  2  provides  a  detailed  analysis  to  describe  BP 
responses  with  “high”/12.5  mg  HCTZ  and  “high”/25  mg  HCTZ,  where  “high”  represents  either 
irbesartan  300  mg  or  atenolol  100  mg.  The  addition  of  25  mg  HCTZ  to  300  mg  irbesartan  led  to  a 
24.0/13.3 mmHg reduction in SeSBP and SeDBP whereas the 300/12.5 resulted in a 10.7/5.0 mmHg 
reduction.  
The  normalisation  rate  for  SeDBP  <  90  mmHg  and  for  SeSBP  <140  and  SeDBP  <  90  mmHg  was 
reached by additional 32% and 18% respectively after the first visit on 300/25 mg irbesartan/HCTZ.

Both treatment groups (irbesartan and atenolol) showed statistically significant reductions from 
baseline in SeSBP and SeDBP. The mean reduction was similar in both groups at week 48, although 
the reduction was slightly higher in the irbesartan group.  
The  primary  endpoint  of  this  trial  was  not  the  incremental  BP  effect  of  the  titration  but  the  results 
obtained  are  considered  of  use.  Patients  not  controlled  (22)  with  the  300/12.5  combination  were 
titrated to 300/25. An incremental BP lowering effect was observed for both SBP and DBP (13.3 and 
8.3 mm Hg, respectively). After receiving the higher dose (300/25 mg), an additional 32% (7/22) of 
the uncontrolled patients achieved SeDBP < 90 mmHg, and 18% (4/22) were controlled with respect 
to SeSBP and SeDBP (<140/<90 mmHg). 
Study Mono LT (CV131-002 ,025, 027, 028, 029, 031 and 050 LT) 
In  this  open  label  long  term  study,  170  patients  were  titrated  from  300/12.5  to  300/25  mg 
irbesartan/HCTZ.  The  average  follow-up  on  the  higher  combination  dose  from  the  last  visit  on 
300/12.5 mg was 132 days.  
Systolic and diastolic BP reductions (placebo baseline) after 1 month of treatment on 300/25mg were  
-20.5  and  -13.0  mm  Hg,  respectively  and  were  well  maintained  for  the  average  of  5  months  of 
treatment  duration.  The  incremental  systolic  and  diastolic  BP  lowering  after  1  month  of  the  higher 
dose  combination  300/25mg  was  -8.3  and  -4.8  mmHg,  respectively.  At  last  observation  carried 
forward (LOCF) the incremental BP lowering effect was well maintained. Compared to the last visit 
on  300/12.5mg,  the  incremental  BP  lowering  for  300/25mg  was  -7.8  mm  Hg  and  -4.2  mm  Hg  for 
SeSBP and SeDBP respectively. (See table 3)

The incremental control rates (defined by both SeSBP < 140 mmHg and SeDBP < 90 mmHg) on the 
high dose combination 300/25mg in subjects previously uncontrolled on 300/12.5, are shown in Table 
4.  Both  systolic  and  diastolic  BP  control  rates  were  substantially  improved  |(33%)  after  1  month  of 
treatment  with  the  higher  dose  and  were  maintained  at  LOCF  after  almost  5  months  of  treatment 
(Tables 4 and 4a), thus demonstrating long term effectiveness.

Normalisation rates (trough SeDBP <90 mm Hg) ranged from 75-85% and total responder rates 
(normalised or ≥ 10 mm Hg trough SeDBP reduction) ranged from 81-91%, while target BP was

The specific incremental BP lowering effect of 300/25 mg irbesartan/HCTZ compared with 150/12.5 
mg  is  shown  in  the  table  below.  The  post-hoc  data  presented  in  the  table  are  derived  only  from 
subjects titrated from 150/12.5 to 300/25 without adjunctive medication.Values in the table correspond 
to  the  last  visit  on  150/12.5  mg  combination  and  first  visit  after  dose  titration  to  300/25  mg 
irbesartan/HCTZ. The mean time between the 2 visits was 23 days. From last visit 150/12.5 mg to first 
visit with 300/25 mg irbesartan/HCTZ the control rate increased dramatically from 2% to 48%.

143.1±11.1 mm Hg, p<0.0001 for SBP and from 101.4±5.2 to 86.7±6.7 mm Hg, (p< 0.0001) for DBP 
after treatment in all of 57 patients. Likewise, average values of both 24-h SBP and 24-h DBP were 
significantly  reduced  (from  146.0±11.0  to  123.3±13.3  mm  Hg,  p<0.001  for  24-h  SBP;  and  from 
89.8±8.2 to 76.5±9.4 mm Hg, p< 0.001 for 24-h DBP).  
The  response  rate  (BP  lowering  >  5  mm  Hg  of  either  24h-SBP  or  24h-DBP  average  values)  was 
94.7% and the control rate (daytime BP< 135/85 mm Hg) was 68.4%. 
Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety of irbesartan has been extensively studied studied in doses up to 900 mg, in 19 completed 
clinical studies with a total of 2,746 subjects. Different population subgroups were represented across the 
various  dose  groups,  including  1049  women,  620  elderly  (>65 years)  including  98  very  elderly  (>  75 
years) subjects, 351 blacks and 259 subjects in “other” racial groups. In the LT protocols, 2306  subjects 
were treated for > 6 months (including > 300 elderly subjects) and 2129 subjects for > 1 year. These data 
were submitted in 1997 in the original irbesartan/HCTZ marketing authorisation application (MAA). 
Since  the  first  marketing  approval  of  irbesartan/HCTZ  in  the  US  30  September  1997  exposure  to 
irbesartan/HCTZ is estimated at 3,483,744 patient-treatment years.  
This summary will focus on the 300/25 mg irbesartan/HCTZ combination patients. In addition, further 
to  a  request  from  CHMP,  a  detailed  comparative  analysis  (300/12.5  vs  300/25)  focussing  on  the 
incidence of dizziness and potassium changes over time has been submitted by the MAH. 
The  total  exposure  to  the  newly  proposed  300/25  mg  irbesartan/HCTZ  combination  is  approximately 
650 patients; 406 patients exposed in the 2 long-term follow up studies, and 85, 41, 61 and 22 patients 
exposed  in  the  CV131-032,  CV131-037,  CV131-042  and  CV131-052  randomised  controlled  trials, 
respectively. In the Coca et al. publication, all 57 patients received 300/25 mg of irbesartan/HCTZ. All 
subjects  in  all  studies  were  monitored  for  the  occurrence  of  adverse  events  (AEs)  and  laboratory  test 
abnormalities. AEs were classified by ICD codes. The relationship of each AE to study drug according 
to the investigator’s blinded opinion was also recorded. Mean changes in selected laboratory parameters 
including electrolytes and the risk factors of fasting glucose and lipids were also assessed. 
Adverse events 
The  frequency of all  AE  regardless  of  attribution was similar  or  slightly higher with  irbesartan/HCTZ 
(59%)  than  with  irbesartan  alone  (56%),  HCTZ  alone  (58%)  or  placebo  (53%).  AEs  in  the 
cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems were more common in the combination and HCTZ groups, 
whereas nervous system events were more common in the combination and placebo groups. As outlined 
in  the  individual  study  reports,  no  relationship  between  irbesartan/HCTZ  dose  and  AE  frequency  was 
seen. The most common AEs reported from placebo-controlled Irbesartan/HCTZ trials are shown below.

CV131-037 
The mean duration of exposure was 55 days. The overall incidence of AEs did not appear to correlate 
with  the  dose  of  either  agent;  indeed,  the  highest  AE  rates  tended  to  occur  in  the  subjects  receiving 
placebo  or  the  lowest  doses.  There  were  no  differences  in  the  incidence  of  serious  AE  (SAE)  or 
treatment discontinuations between different combinations and doses. None of the 11 SAEs reported was 
considered  related  to  study  drug.  Two  out  of  the  22  patients  who  discontinued  received  300/25  mg 
irbesartan/HCTZ.  A  few  events  (dizziness  and  dyspepsia/heartburn,  and  perhaps  diarrhoea)  showed  a 
trend by dose, but the small numbers are hard to interpret.  
There was an increased frequency of dizziness in the 300/25 mg group (9 vs 3 on 300/12.5 mg and 5 
on 37.5 mg /HCTZ 6.25 and 37.5/25 mg respectively). This is illustrated in Table 5a below. 
It is of importance to note that the various doses of irbesartan (0-300 mg) or HCTZ (0-25 mg) or their 
combinations  were  administered  to  subjects  after  a  4-5  week  placebo  lead  in.  Since  the 
antihypertensive  effect  is  more  pronounced  in  the  high  dose  cells,  it  is  not  unexpected  that  some 
subjects experienced dizziness when switched directly from placebo to 300/25 mg, which lowers SBP 
in  the  range  of  20-24  mm  Hg.  This  abrupt  initiation  of  a  high  dose  combination  is  clearly  not 
recommended in the posology section of the SPC.  
There  were  no  increases  in  potassium-related  laboratory  AE  during  the  8  weeks  of  the  trial  in  the 
combination group compared to either of the monotherapy groups.  
CV131-032 
Sixty-six (54.5%) patients in the irbesartan group and 39 (63.9%) in the enalapril group experienced 
an AE. Respiratory side effects (cough, etc) are more prevalent in the enalapril group. The distribution

There were 7 (5.8%)  discontinuations due to AE in the irbesartan regimen group, one of which was 
considered  related  to  study  drug  (irbesartan  150  mg  monotherapy),  and  3  (4.9%)  in  the  enalapril 
group, all of which were considered related to study drug.  
CV131-042 
There was no clear dose response related increase in treatment emergent AE for the 2 different (low/high 
dose) irbesartan/HCTZ regimens. There were 9 discontinuations of which 3 were considered to have a 
possible relationship to treatment (1 losartan/HCTZ 50/12.5 mg, 1 losartan/HCTZ/nifedipine 100/25/30 
mg and 1 irbesartan/HCTZ/atenolol 300/12.5/50 mg). 
CV131052 
The exposure to irbesartan/HCTZ 300/25 was between 18 and 36 weeks in this trial. In general, the 
irbesartan-based regimen proved to be safe and well tolerated compared to an atenolol-based regimen. 
Adverse Drug Experience (ADE) frequency was lower in the irbesartan group. The irbesartan regimen 
was  less  prone  to  cause  AEs  related  to  hypotension,  such  as  dizziness,  orthostatic  dizziness, 
hypotension  and  syncope.  There  were  no  reports  of  dizziness  or  orthostatic  dizziness  from  patients 
receiving 300/25 mg irbesartan/HCTZ. There was no investigator identified laboratory AE related to 
either hyper- or hypokalemia in the irbesartan group during the 48 weeks of follow up. There were 2 
marked abnormalities (MA) in potassium levels.

The AE rates by dose in the monotherapy LT extension protocols suggest that irbesartan monotherapy 
and irbesartan/HCTZ were associated with similar rates of AEs, whereas subjects receiving adjunctive 
medication  had  higher  rates  of  AEs  (albeit  with  longer  mean  exposure).  Considering  the  well-known 
limitations  in  trying  to  assess  dose-response  relationships  in  optional  titration  designs,  the  overall 
long-term  data  do  not  suggest  any  important  increase  in  the  risk  of  AEs  with  the  combination  vs 
monotherapy, nor with higher doses of the irbesartan/HCTZ combination. 
Only  18  subjects  treated  with  combination  irbesartan/HCTZ  doses  ranging  150-300/12.5-25mg 
discontinued from the open label monotherapy extension study due to AEs. The proportion of subjects 
who discontinued due to AEs in the lower HCTZ dose combinations (150 to 300mg/12.5mg HCTZ) 
was  slightly  lower  than  in  the  300/25mg  combination  group.  The  most  common  AEs  reported  were 
musculoskeletal pain, respiratory infection and headache, all typical AEs of hypertension clinical studies. 
There  was  no  difference  in  the  incidence  of  discontinuations  due  to  events  potentially  linked  to 
hypotension or metabolic/electrolyte imbalance  
With the overall low number of events and no difference between groups it is impossible to draw any 
conclusions regarding dose relationship. But, in summary, long term exposure to high-dose irbesartan 
/HCTZ  did  not  cause  more  discontinuations  or  SAEs  than  in  lower  HCTZ  dose  groups  (150-
300/12.5mg). 
The overall incidence of MAs was low and there were no increases in potassium-related MAs with the 
irbesartan/HCTZ regimen compared with irbesartan monotherapy (1.3 vs 1.2 % respectively). A total 
of  6  MAs  of  hypokalemia  were  reported  in  the  irbesartan/HCTZ  group  during  an  exposure  of  543 
patient  years.  MAs  in  BUN,  creatinine,  glucose  fasting,  potassium,  triglicerides  and  creatine  kinase 
occurred in greater than 1 % in all of the doses used in this long term extension. There is a trend to 
increased creatinine and BUN in high HCTZ combination, which is expected

There  was  no  orthostatic  hypotension  reported  for  these  dose  categories  and  only  1  case  of 
hypotension.  Syncope  was  reported  in  2  cases  on  150-225/12.5  mg  and  in  2  cases  on  300/25mg. 
Orthostatic  dizziness  and  dizziness  were  reported  slightly  more  often  with  the  higher  dose 
combination. All cases of orthostatic dizziness were mild. In 4 subjects orthostatic dizziness appeared 
to  be  temporarily  related  to  dose  increase;  in  3  subjects  it  occurred  within  1-7  days  following  the 
increase  of  irbesartan/HCTZ  from  150/12.5  to  300/25mg,  and  in  1  case  it  occurred  when  atenolol 
25mg was added to irbesartan /HCTZ 300/25mg. 
Dizziness  was  more  frequent  in  the  300/25mg  group  than  in  the  150-225/12.5mg  group,  but  the 
incidence  was  similar  in  the  300/12.5  mg  group.  Overall,  dizziness  was  mild  and  resolved  during 
observation and most subjects continued in the study.  
Clinical  laboratory  safety  evaluations  were  obtained  at  initiation  of  the  open  label  therapy,  every  4 
months,  at  month  12  or  at  discontinuation.  Additionally,  electrolytes,  BUN  and  creatinine  were 
obtained  following  upward  titration  of  combination  doses.  There  was  very  limited  experience 
available  for  patients  on  300/12.5  mg.  The  number  of  lab  tests  available  and  the  subjects  who 
experienced at least 1 MA potentially related to metabolic/electrolyte imbalance are presented by dose 
in Table 8d.

Three patients experienced low potassium in the 150-225/12.5 dose category, 1 patient in 300/12.5 and 
7 patients in 300/25mg group. As expected, there was a trend towards higher incidence at higher doses 
of  the  combination.  However,  a  lower  incidence  of  hyperkalemia  with  HCTZ  25  mg  was  observed. 
Similarly,  slightly  more  subjects  had  low  potassium  Laboratory  Adverse  Event  reported  by 
investigators.  
In conclusion long term treatment with the combination irbesartan/HCTZ in the dose ranges of 150-
300/12.5-25mg  was  well  tolerated  and  safe.  There  was  a  trend  to  somewhat  more  dizziness  in  the 
higher  dose  groups  but  this  did  not  appear  to  be  related  to  the  titration  step  from  300/12.5  to 
300/25mg. 
Coca et al. 
The following AEs were reported: dizziness (7%), Nausea (3.5%) and palpitation (1.7%). The rate of AE 
is in line with that expected from antihypertensive treatment with “sartans” and/or HCTZ.There were no 
discontinuations  due  to  AEs,  nor  were  there  any  SAEs  or  deaths.  Study  follow-up  was  12  weeks  (84 
days).  
Other Laboratory findings 
The mean changes from baseline in laboratory analytes reflect the known effects of each component of 
the  combination.  Dose-related  changes  with  HCTZ  were  evident  in  the  major  trials,  ie,  decreases  in 
sodium  and  potassium,  increases  in  BUN,  uric  acid,  glucose,  cholesterol  and  triglycerides.  Of  note, 
irbesartan  tended  to  ameliorate  the  HCTZ  dose-related  changes  in  plasma  potassium,  glucose  and 
cholesterol.  These  results  suggest  that  irbesartan/HCTZ  doses  up  to  300/25  mg  do  not  dramatically 
change the potassium homeostasis due to the ameliorating effect of irbesartan. 
In  general,  there  were  no  differences  between  irbesartan  monotherapy  and  irbesartan/HCTZ 
combinations  to  endocrine/metabolic,  haematopoetic,  hepatic,  musculoskeletal  and  renal  analytes 
except a higher frequency of hypokalemia (2.2% vs 0.2%). However, irbesartan monotherapy resulted 
in a higher frequency of hyperkalemia (0.4% vs 0.2%). 
Discussion 
Efficacy 
The absolute SeSBP and SeDBP reduction of irbesartan/HCTZ 300/25 vs. untreated baseline in mild 
to  moderate  patients  appears  to  be  approximately  21-24  and  13-16  mm  Hg  respectively.  Data  from 
276  irbesartan/HCTZ  treated  patients  are  available  to  directly  compare  the  efficacy  of  300/25mg 
combination with the already approved 300/12.5mg combination, either in the parallel cell short term 
comparison trial (84  patients) or in long term elective titration studies -  including 170 patients from

long term  open label extension and 22 patients from  study CV131-052. In all these trials the SeSBP 
reduction  was  more  pronounced  in  patients  receiving  300/25  mg,  with  the  incremental  efficacy 
ranging from 7.2 to 13.3 mm Hg with respect to those receiving 300/12.5 mg.  
In all trials except the CV131037 trial SeDBP reduction was greater in patients receiving 300/25 mg 
than in those treated with 300/12.5 mg. The magnitude of this effect was 4.2 to 8.3 mm Hg. In trial 
CV131037, the DBP, the rate of normalised patients and the rate of “responders” were similar for both 
combinations. The DBP response surface model predicts less SBP reduction (4.7mmHg) but predicts a 
reduction  of  the  DBP  of  2.3mmHg.  Although  such  small  reductions  are  likely  to  translate,  in 
epidemiological terms, into improvements in morbi/mortality, the real issue is the number of patients 
uncontrollable with 300/12.5 who would be controlled with 300/25. 
In  fact  the  only  blinded  evidence  available  on  non-responders  to  300/12.5  titrated  to  300/25  comes 
from  study  CV131-052,  whose  primary  endpoint  was  the  change  in  LVMI  from  baseline  in 
hypertensive patients with LVH. An incremental BP lowering effect was observed both on SBP and 
DBP (13.3 and 8.3 mm Hg, respectively). However, it should be taken into account that the number of 
patients  titrated  was  rather  small  (22)  and  that  the  design  of  the  study  was  not  to  determine  the  BP 
lowering  effect  of  the  combination.  The  proportion  of  patients  normalised  (32%)  is  in  line  with  the 
rate  obtained  in  the  MONO  LT  open  label  study  (31%).  Thus,  the  data  submitted  are  sufficient  to 
conclude that there is an incremental lowering effect for the titration step, especially for the SBP, and 
that it translates into the normalisation of some, probably not many, patients. These findings have been 
included in section 5.1 of the SPC. 
Safety 
In  general  terms,  there  is  a  trend  toward  a  higher  frequency  of  some  AE  with  the  higher  dose 
combinations,  although  the  overall  incidence  was  low,  the  severity  mild  and  it  did  not  cause  more 
discontinuations. In some studies, notably the matrix study CV131037, dizziness was more frequently 
reported  in  the  300/25  group  compared  with  lower  doses.  This  was  not  unexpected  given  that  some 
subjects switched directly from placebo to 300/25 mg, which lowers SBP in the range of 20-24 mm 
Hg. This abrupt initiation of a high dose combination is not recommended in the Posology section of 
the SPC. 
With  regard  to  the  potassium  abnormalities,  the  higher  doses  of  the  combination  lead  to  increases 
renal  parameters  and  low  potassium,  usually  seen  when  HCTZ  was  increased  from  12.5  to  25mg; 
these abnormalities were mild and reversible. It is well known that the dose dependent side effects of 
HCTZ  (particularly  electrolyte  disturbances)  may  increase  when  titrating  the  HCTZ.  This  is  clearly 
reflected in section 4.8 of the SPC. 
Thus,  from  the  safety  point  of  view,  for  a  patient  uncontrolled  on  300/12.5,  the  titration  to  300/25 
appears reasonable, but an increase in the dose-related effects of the HCTZ is to be expected. 
7.3  Conclusion 
The  new  300/25  dose  will  control  BP  in  some  patients,  probably  not  many,  who  are  not  adequately 
controlled with 300/12.5, despite the modest additional BP reduction obtained by increasing the HCTZ 
to 25 mg. For such patients for whom the safety/tolerability profile is still acceptable, the new dosage 
will  be  preferable  to  adding/substituting  their  existing  therapy  drugs  of  a  different  therapeutic  class. 
Nonetheless,  it  should  be  emphasised  that  the  proportion  of  patients  not  controlled  by  the  already 
approved 300/12.5 mg likely to be controlled by the new 300/25 mg combination is not high, and the 
prescriber may directly consider alternative therapeutic approaches to increasing the dose of the HCTZ 
diuretic.

No dosage adjustment is required in patients with

comparing the effect of once-weekly Trulicity with insulin 
glargine on glycaemic control over 52 weeks in patients with 
type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and moderate or severe chronic 
kidney disease. In addition, the MAH took to opportunity to 
mild, moderate or severe renal impairment (eGFR 
<90 to ≥15 mL/min/1.73m2). There is very 
limited experience in patients with end stage renal 
disease (<15 ml/min/1.73m2), therefore Trulicity 
cannot be recommended in this population.

update the ATC code and to correct the "Instructions for 
use" in Section 6.6 of the SmPC to make it consistent with 
instructions on "How to store Trulicity" in the Package 
Leaflet (PL), which was also updated in section 2 ‘Warnings 
and precautions’ to reflect the information in the “renal 
impairment” section 4.2 of the SmPC. The RMP version 1.12 
has also been agreed. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new 
quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
In a 52 week study, Trulicity 1.5 mg and 0.75 mg 
were compared to titrated insulin glargine as add-
on to prandial insulin lispro to evaluate the effect 
on glycaemic control and safety of patients with 
moderate to severe chronic kidney disease. 
Patients discontinued their prestudy insulin 
regimen at randomisation.  
The pharmacokinetic profile of Trulicity 0.75 mg 
and 1.5 mg once weekly was similar to that 
demonstrated in previous clinical studies. This 
clinical study did not include patients with end 
stage renal disease. 
At 26 weeks, both Trulicity 1.5 mg and 0.75 mg 
were non-inferior to insulin glargine in lowering of 
HbA1c and this effect was sustained at 52 weeks. 
A similar percentage of patients achieved HbA1c 
targets of < 8.0 % at 26 and 52 weeks with both 
dulaglutide doses as well as insulin glargine. 
The rates of documented symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia with Trulicity 1.5 mg and Trulicity 
0.75 mg, and insulin glargine were 4.44, 4.34, and 
9.62 episodes/patient/year, respectively. No 
patients reported cases of severe hypoglycaemia 
with Trulicity 1.5 mg, six with Trulicity 0.75 mg, 
and seventeen with insulin glargine. The safety 
profile of Trulicity in patients with renal 
impairment was similar to that observed in other 
studies with Trulicity.

new study which examined the efficacy and safety 
of Trulicity in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
who were already receiving therapy with a 
sulphonylurea, a common class of drugs used to 
lower blood sugar. 
The results of the study confirmed the efficacy of 
dulaglutide in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients, 
when taken as add-on to a sulphonylurea. New 
safety data from the study did not raise any new 
safety concerns. The relevant key safety 
information and warnings are already included in 
the SmPC but an update, as proposed by the MAH, 
was needed to include the specific findings of the 
study about the concomitant use of dulaglutide 
with a sulphonylurea alone. As a consequence, 
sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) were updated.

In addition the MAH is updating the PI in accordance with 
the QRD template (version 9.1) and correcting an error in 
section 5.2 of the SmPC with regards to the value provided 
for clearance of the dulaglutide 0.75mg dose.

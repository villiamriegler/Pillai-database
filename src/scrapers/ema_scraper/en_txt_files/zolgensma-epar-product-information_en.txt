CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Zolgensma is indicated for the treatment of: 
- 
patients with 5q spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) with a bi-allelic mutation in the SMN1 gene 
and a clinical diagnosis of SMA Type 1, or 
patients with 5q SMA with a bi-allelic mutation in the SMN1 gene and up to 3 copies of the 
SMN2 gene. 
- 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated and administered in clinical centres and supervised by a physician 
experienced in the management of patients with SMA. 
Before administration of onasemnogene abeparvovec, baseline laboratory testing is required, 
including, but not limited to: 
• 
• 
AAV9 antibody testing using an appropriately validated assay, 
liver function: alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total 
bilirubin, albumin, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time (PTT), and international 
normalised ratio (INR), 
creatinine, 
complete blood count (including haemoglobin and platelet count), and 
troponin-I. 
• 
• 
• 
The need for close monitoring of liver function, platelet count and troponin-I after administration and 
the need for corticosteroid treatment are to be considered when establishing the timing of 
onasemnogene abeparvovec treatment (see section 4.4). 
Due to the increased risk of serious systemic immune response, it is recommended that patients are 
clinically stable in their overall health status (e.g. hydration and nutritional status, absence of 
infection) prior to onasemnogene abeparvovec infusion. In case of acute or chronic uncontrolled active 
infections, treatment should be postponed until the infection has resolved and the patient is clinically 
stable (see sub-sections 4.2 ‘Immunomodulatory regimen’ and 4.4 ‘Systemic immune response’). 
Posology 
For single-dose intravenous infusion only. 
Patients will receive a dose of nominal 1.1 x 1014 vg/kg onasemnogene abeparvovec. The total volume 
is determined by patient body weight. 
Table 1 gives the recommended dosing for patients who weigh 2.6 kg to 21.0 kg.

Immunomodulatory regimen 
An immune response to the AAV9 capsid will occur after administration of onasemnogene 
abeparvovec (see section 4.4). This can lead to elevations in liver aminotransferases, elevations of 
troponin I, or decreased platelet counts (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). To dampen the immune response 
immunomodulation with corticosteroids is recommended. Where feasible, the patient’s vaccination 
schedule should be adjusted to accommodate concomitant corticosteroid administration prior to and 
following onasemnogene abeparvovec infusion (see section 4.5). 
Prior to initiation of the immunomodulatory regimen and prior to administration of onasemnogene 
abeparvovec, the patient must be checked for signs and symptoms of active infectious disease of any 
nature. 
Starting 24 hours prior to infusion of onasemnogene abeparvovec it is recommended to initiate an 
immunomodulatory regimen following the schedule below (see Table 2). If at any time patients do not 
respond adequately to the equivalent of 1 mg/kg/day oral prednisolone, based on the patient’s clinical 
course, prompt consultation with a paediatric gastroenterologist or hepatologist and adjustment to the 
recommended immunomodulatory regimen, including increased dose, longer duration or prolongation 
of corticosteroid taper, should be considered (see section 4.4). If oral corticosteroid therapy is not 
tolerated intravenous corticosteroid may be considered as clinically indicated.

Post-infusion 
30 days (including the day of administration 
of onasemnogene abeparvovec) 
Followed by 28 days: 
For patients with unremarkable findings 
(normal clinical exam, total bilirubin, and 
whose ALT and AST values are both below 
2 × upper limit of normal (ULN) at the end 
of the 30 days period: 
or 
Prednisolone orally 1 mg/kg/day 
(or equivalent if another 
corticosteroid is used) 
Prednisolone orally 1 mg/kg/day 
(or equivalent if another 
corticosteroid is used) 
Systemic corticosteroids should be 
tapered gradually. 
Tapering of prednisolone (or 
equivalent if another corticosteroid 
is used), e.g. 2 weeks at 
0.5 mg/kg/day and then 2 weeks at 
0.25 mg/kg/day oral prednisolone 
For patients with liver function 
abnormalities at the end of the 30 days 
period: continuing until the AST and ALT 
values are below 2 × ULN and all other 
assessments (e.g. total bilirubin) return to 
normal range, followed by tapering over 
28 days or longer if needed. 
Systemic corticosteroids 
(equivalent to oral prednisolone 
1 mg/kg/day) 
Systemic corticosteroids should be 
tapered gradually. 
Liver function (ALT, AST, total bilirubin) should be monitored at regular intervals for at least 
3 months following onasemnogene abeparvovec infusion (weekly in the first month and during the 
entire corticosteroid taper period, followed by every two weeks for another month), and at other times 
as clinically indicated. Patients with worsening liver function test results and/or signs or symptoms of 
acute illness should be promptly clinically assessed and monitored closely (see section 4.4). 
If another corticosteroid is used by the physician in place of prednisolone, similar considerations and 
approach to taper the dose after 30 days should be taken as appropriate.

Special populations 
Renal impairment 
The safety and efficacy of onasemnogene abeparvovec have not been established in patients with renal 
impairment and onasemnogene abeparvovec therapy should be carefully considered. A dose 
adjustment should not be considered. 
Hepatic impairment 
Patients with ALT, AST, total bilirubin levels (except due to neonatal jaundice) >2 × ULN or positive 
serology for hepatitis B or hepatitis C have not been studied in clinical studies with onasemnogene 
abeparvovec. Onasemnogene abeparvovec therapy should be carefully considered in patients with 
hepatic impairment (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). A dose adjustment should not be considered. 
0SMN1/1SMN2 genotype 
No dose adjustment should be considered in patients with a bi-allelic mutation of the SMN1 gene and 
only one copy of SMN2 (see section 5.1). 
Anti-AAV9 antibodies 
No dose adjustment should be considered in patients with baseline anti-AAV9 antibody titres above 
1:50 (see section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of onasemnogene abeparvovec in premature neonates before reaching full-
term gestational age have not been established. No data are available. Administration of 
onasemnogene abeparvovec should be carefully considered because concomitant treatment with 
corticosteroids may adversely affect neurological development. 
There is limited experience in patients 2 years of age and older or with body weight above 13.5 kg. 
The safety and efficacy of onasemnogene abeparvovec in these patients have not been established. 
Currently available data are described in section 5.1. A dose adjustment should not be considered (see 
Table 1). 
Method of administration 
For intravenous use. 
Onasemnogene abeparvovec is administered as a single-dose intravenous infusion. It should be 
administered with a syringe pump as a single intravenous infusion with a slow infusion of 
approximately 60 minutes. It must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus. 
Insertion of a secondary (‘back-up’) catheter is recommended in case of blockage in the primary 
catheter. Following completion of infusion, the line should be flushed with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for injection. 
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product 
This medicinal product contains a genetically-modified organism. Healthcare professionals should 
therefore take appropriate precautions (use of gloves, safety goggles, laboratory coat and sleeves) 
when handling or administering the product (see section 6.6). 
For detailed instructions on the preparation, handling, accidental exposure and disposal (including 
proper handling of bodily waste) of onasemnogene abeparvovec, see section 6.6.

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Pre-existing immunity against AAV9 
Anti-AAV9 antibody formation can take place after natural exposure. There have been several studies 
on the prevalence of AAV9 antibodies in the general population that show low rates of prior exposure 
to AAV9 in the paediatric population. Patients should be tested for the presence of AAV9 antibodies 
prior to infusion with onasemnogene abeparvovec. Re-testing may be performed if AAV9 antibody 
titres are reported as above 1:50. It is not yet known whether or under what conditions onasemnogene 
abeparvovec can be safely and effectively administered in the presence of anti-AAV9 antibodies 
above 1:50 (see sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
Advanced SMA 
Since SMA results in progressive and non-reversible damage to motor neurons, the benefit of 
onasemnogene abeparvovec in symptomatic patients depends on the degree of disease burden at the 
time of treatment, with earlier treatment resulting in potential higher benefit. While advanced 
symptomatic SMA patients will not achieve the same gross motor development as unaffected healthy 
peers they may clinically benefit from gene replacement therapy, dependent on the advancement of 
disease at the time of treatment (see section 5.1). 
The treating physician should consider that the benefit is seriously reduced in patients with profound 
muscle weakness and respiratory failure, patients on permanent ventilation, and patients not able to 
swallow. 
The benefit/risk profile of onasemnogene abeparvovec in patients with advanced SMA, kept alive 
through permanent ventilation and without the ability to thrive, is not established. 
Immunogenicity 
An immune response to the AAV9 capsid will occur after infusion of onasemnogene abeparvovec, 
including antibody formation against the AAV9 capsid and T-cell mediated immune response, despite 
the immunomodulatory regimen recommended in section 4.2 (see also sub-section ‘Systemic immune 
response’ below). 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatotoxicity 
Immune-mediated hepatotoxicity is generally manifested as elevated ALT and/or AST levels. Acute 
serious liver injury and acute liver failure, including fatal cases, have been reported with 
onasemnogene abeparvovec use, typically within 2 months after infusion and despite receiving 
corticosteroids before and after infusion. Immune-mediated hepatotoxicity may require adjustment of 
the immunomodulatory regimen including longer duration, increased dose, or prolongation of the 
corticosteroid taper.

The risks and benefits of onasemnogene abeparvovec therapy should be carefully considered in 
patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment. 
Patients with pre-existing hepatic impairment or acute hepatic viral infection may be at higher 
risk of acute serious liver injury (see section 4.2). 
Administration of AAV vector often results in aminotransferase elevations. 
Acute serious liver injury and acute liver failure have occurred with onasemnogene 
abeparvovec. Cases of acute liver failure with fatal outcome have been reported (see 
section 4.8). 
Prior to infusion, liver function of all patients should be assessed by clinical examination and 
laboratory testing (see section 4.2). 
In order to mitigate potential aminotransferase elevations, a systemic corticosteroid should be 
administered to all patients before and after onasemnogene abeparvovec infusion (see 
section 4.2). 
Liver function should be monitored at regular intervals for at least 3 months after infusion, and 
at other times as clinically indicated (see section 4.2). 
Patients with worsening liver function test results and/or signs or symptoms of acute illness 
should be promptly clinically assessed and monitored closely. 
In case hepatic injury is suspected, prompt consultation with a paediatric gastroenterologist or 
hepatologist, adjustment of the recommended immunomodulatory regimen and further testing is 
recommended (e.g. albumin, prothrombin time, PTT, and INR). 
AST/ALT/total bilirubin should be assessed weekly for the first month after onasemnogene 
abeparvovec infusion and during the entire corticosteroid taper period. Tapering of prednisolone 
should not be considered until AST/ALT levels are less than 2 × ULN and all other assessments (e.g. 
total bilirubin) return to normal range (see section 4.2). If the patient is clinically stable with 
unremarkable findings at the end of the corticosteroid taper period, liver function should continue to 
be monitored every two weeks for another month. 
Thrombocytopenia 
Transient decreases in platelet counts, some of which met the criteria for thrombocytopenia, were 
observed in onasemnogene abeparvovec clinical studies. In most cases, the lowest platelet value 
occurred the first week following onasemnogene abeparvovec infusion. 
Post-marketing cases with platelet count <25 x 109/L have been reported to occur within two weeks 
following administration. 
Platelet counts should be obtained before onasemnogene abeparvovec infusion and should be closely 
monitored within the first two weeks following infusion and on a regular basis afterwards, at least 
weekly for the first month and every other week for the second and third months until platelet counts 
return to baseline. 
Thrombotic microangiopathy 
Cases of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) have been reported with onasemnogene abeparvovec 
(see section 4.8). Cases generally occurred within the first two weeks after onasemnogene 
abeparvovec infusion. TMA is an acute and life-threatening condition, which is characterised by 
thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia. Fatal outcomes have been reported. 
Acute kidney injury has also been observed. In some cases, concurrent immune system activation (e.g. 
infections, vaccinations) has been reported (see sections 4.2 and 4.5 for information on administration 
of vaccinations). 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thrombocytopenia is a key feature of TMA, therefore platelet counts should be closely monitored 
within the first two weeks following infusion and on a regular basis afterwards (see sub-section 
‘Thrombocytopenia’). In case of thrombocytopenia, further evaluation including diagnostic testing for 
haemolytic anaemia and renal dysfunction should be undertaken promptly. If patients show clinical 
signs, symptoms or laboratory findings consistent with TMA, a specialist should be consulted 
immediately to manage TMA as clinically indicated. Caregivers should be informed about signs and 
symptoms of TMA and should be advised to seek urgent medical care if such symptoms occur. 
Elevated troponin-I 
Increases in cardiac troponin-I levels following infusion with onasemnogene abeparvovec were 
observed (see section 4.8). Elevated troponin-I levels found in some patients may indicate potential 
myocardial tissue injury. Based on these findings and the observed cardiac toxicity in mice, troponin-I 
levels should be obtained before onasemnogene abeparvovec infusion and monitored for at least 
3 months following onasemnogene abeparvovec infusion or until levels return to within normal 
reference range for SMA patients. Consider consultation with a cardiac expert as needed. 
Systemic immune response 
Due to the increased risk of serious systemic immune response, it is recommended that patients are 
clinically stable in their overall health status (e.g. hydration and nutritional status, absence of 
infection) prior to onasemnogene abeparvovec infusion. Treatment should not be initiated concurrently 
to active infections, either acute (such as acute respiratory infections or acute hepatitis) or uncontrolled 
chronic (such as chronic active hepatitis B), until the infection has resolved and the patient is clinically 
stable (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
The immunomodulatory regimen (see section 4.2) might also impact the immune response to 
infections (e.g. respiratory), potentially resulting in more severe clinical courses of the infection. 
Patients with infection were excluded from participation in clinical trials with onasemnogene 
abeparvovec. Increased vigilance in the prevention, monitoring, and management of infection is 
recommended before and after onasemnogene abeparvovec infusion. Seasonal prophylactic 
treatments, that prevent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections, are recommended and should be 
up to date. Where feasible, the patient’s vaccination schedule should be adjusted to accommodate 
concomitant corticosteroid administration prior to and following onasemnogene abeparvovec infusion 
(see section 4.5). 
If the duration of corticosteroid treatment is prolonged or the dose is increased, the treating physician 
should be aware of the possibility of adrenal insufficiency. 
Risk of tumourigenicity as a result of vector integration 
There is a theoretical risk of tumourigenicity due to integration of AAV vector DNA into the genome. 
Onasemnogene abeparvovec is composed of a non-replicating AAV9 vector whose DNA persists 
largely in episomal form. Rare instances of random vector integration into human DNA are possible 
with recombinant AAV. The clinical relevance of individual integration events is unknown, but it is 
acknowledged that individual integration events could potentially contribute to a risk of 
tumourigenicity. 
So far, no cases of malignancies associated with onasemnogene abeparvovec treatment have been 
reported. In the event of a tumour, the marketing authorisation holder should be contacted for 
guidance on collecting patient samples for testing. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Shedding 
Temporary onasemnogene abeparvovec shedding occurs, primarily through bodily waste. Caregivers 
and patient families should be advised on the following instructions for the proper handling of patient 
stools: 
• 
good hand-hygiene is required when coming into direct contact with patient bodily waste for a 
minimum of 1 month after onasemnogene abeparvovec treatment. 
Disposable nappies can be sealed in double plastic bags and disposed of in household waste. 
• 
Blood, organ, tissue and cell donation 
Patients treated with Zolgensma should not donate blood, organs, tissues or cells for transplantation. 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains 4.6 mg sodium per mL, equivalent to 0.23% of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. Each 5.5 mL vial contains 25.3 mg 
sodium, and each 8.3 mL vial contains 38.2 mg sodium. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. 
Experience with use of onasemnogene abeparvovec in patients receiving hepatotoxic medicinal 
products or using hepatotoxic substances is limited. Safety of onasemnogene abeparvovec in these 
patients have not been established. 
Experience with use of concomitant 5q SMA targeting agents is limited. 
Vaccinations 
Where feasible, the patient’s vaccination schedule should be adjusted to accommodate concomitant 
corticosteroid administration prior to and following onasemnogene abeparvovec infusion (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4). Seasonal RSV prophylaxis is recommended (see section 4.4). Live vaccines, 
such as MMR and varicella, should not be administered to patients on an immunosuppressive steroid 
dose (i.e., ≥ 2 weeks of daily receipt of 20 mg or 2 mg/kg body weight of prednisolone or equivalent). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Human data on use during pregnancy or lactation are not available and animal fertility or reproduction 
studies have not been performed. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Onasemnogene abeparvovec has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety of onasemnogene abeparvovec was evaluated in 99 patients who received onasemnogene 
abeparvovec at the recommended dose (1.1 x 1014 vg/kg) in 5 open-label clinical studies. The most 
frequently reported adverse reactions following administration were hepatic enzyme increased 
(24.2%), hepatotoxicity (9.1%), vomiting (8.1%), thrombocytopenia (6.1%), troponin increased

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Hepatobiliary disorders 
In clinical studies, elevated transaminases > 2 × ULN (and in some cases > 20 × ULN) were observed 
in 31% of patients treated at the recommended dose. These patients were clinically asymptomatic and 
none of them had clinically significant elevations of bilirubin. Serum transaminase elevations usually 
resolved with prednisolone treatment and patients recovered without clinical sequelae (see sections 4.2 
and 4.4). 
Outside of clinical studies, including in the post-marketing setting, there have been reports of children 
developing signs and symptoms of acute liver failure (e.g. jaundice, coagulopathy, encephalopathy) 
typically within 2 months of treatment with onasemnogene abeparvovec, despite receiving 
corticosteroids before and after infusion. Cases of acute liver failure with fatal outcome have been 
reported.

Transient thrombocytopenia 
In clinical studies, transient decreases from baseline in mean platelet counts, some of which met the 
criteria for thrombocytopenia (6.1%), were observed at multiple time points post-dose and normally 
resolved within two weeks. Decreases in platelet counts were more prominent during the first week of 
treatment. Post-marketing cases with transient decrease in platelet count to levels <25 x 109/L within 
two weeks of administration have been reported (see section 4.4). 
Increases in troponin-I levels 
Increases in cardiac troponin-I levels up to 0.2 mcg/L following onasemnogene abeparvovec infusion 
were observed. In the clinical study program, there were no clinically apparent cardiac findings 
observed following administration of onasemnogene abeparvovec (see section 4.4). 
Immunogenicity 
Pre- and post-gene therapy titres of anti-AAV9 antibodies were measured in the clinical studies (see 
section 4.4). All patients that received onasemnogene abeparvovec had anti-AAV9 titres at or 
below 1:50 before treatment. Mean increases from baseline in AAV9 titre were observed in all patients 
at all but 1 time-point for antibody titre levels to AAV9 peptide, reflecting normal response to non-self 
viral antigen. Some patients experienced AAV9 titres exceeding the level of quantification, however 
most of these patients did not have potentially clinically significant adverse reactions. Thus, no 
relationship has been established between high anti-AAV9 antibody titres and the potential for adverse 
reactions or efficacy parameters. 
In the AVXS-101-CL-101 clinical study, 16 patients were screened for anti-AAV9 antibody titre: 
13 had titres less than 1:50 and were enrolled in the study; three patients had titres greater than 1:50, 
two of whom were retested following cessation of breast-feeding and their titres were measured at less 
than 1:50 and both were enrolled in the study. There is no information on whether breastfeeding 
should be restricted in mothers who may be seropositive for anti-AAV9 antibodies. Patients all had 
less than or equal to 1:50 AAV9 antibody titre prior to treatment with onasemnogene abeparvovec and 
subsequently demonstrated an increase in anti-AAV9 antibody titres to at least 1:102,400 and up to 
greater than 1:819,200. 
The detection of antibody formation is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. 
In addition, the observed incidence of antibody (including neutralising antibody) positivity in an assay 
may be influenced by several factors including assay methodology, sample handling, timing of sample 
collection, concomitant medicinal products and underlying disease. 
No onasemnogene abeparvovec-treated patient demonstrated an immune response to the transgene. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
No data from clinical studies are available regarding overdose of onasemnogene abeparvovec. 
Adjustment of the dose of prednisolone, close clinical observation and monitoring of laboratory 
parameters (including clinical chemistry and haematology) for systemic immune response are 
recommended (see section 4.4).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other drugs for disorders of the musculo-skeletal system, ATC code: 
M09AX09 
Mechanism of action 
Onasemnogene abeparvovec is a gene therapy designed to introduce a functional copy of the survival 
motor neuron gene (SMN1) in the transduced cells to address the monogenic root cause of the disease. 
By providing an alternative source of SMN protein expression in motor neurons, it is expected to 
promote the survival and function of transduced motor neurons. 
Onasemnogene abeparvovec is a non-replicating recombinant AAV vector that utilizes AAV9 capsid 
to deliver a stable, fully functional human SMN transgene. The ability of the AAV9 capsid to cross the 
blood brain barrier and transduce motor neurons has been demonstrated. The SMN1 gene present in 
onasemnogene abeparvovec is designed to reside as episomal DNA in the nucleus of transduced cells 
and is expected to be stably expressed for an extended period of time in post-mitotic cells. The 
AAV9 virus is not known to cause disease in humans. The transgene is introduced to target cells as a 
self-complementary double-stranded molecule. Expression of the transgene is driven by a constitutive 
promoter (cytomegalovirus enhanced chicken-β-actin-hybrid), which results in continuous and 
sustained SMN protein expression. Proof of the mechanism of action has been supported by non-
clinical studies and by human biodistribution data. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
AVXS-101-CL-303 Phase 3 study in patients with Type 1 SMA 
AVXS-101-CL-303 (Study CL-303) is a Phase 3 open-label, single-arm, single-dose study of 
intravenous administration of onasemnogene abeparvovec at the therapeutic dose (1.1 × 1014 vg/kg). 
Twenty-two patients were enrolled with Type 1 SMA and 2 copies of SMN2. Before treatment with 
onasemnogene abeparvovec, none of the 22 patients required non-invasive ventilator (NIV) support, 
and all patients could exclusively feed orally (i.e., did not need non-oral nutrition). The mean 
Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia Infant Test of Neuromuscular Disorders (CHOP-INTEND) score 
at baseline was 32.0 (range, 18 to 52). The mean age of the 22 patients at the time of treatment was 
3.7 months (0.5 to 5.9 months). 
Of the 22 enrolled patients, 21 patients survived without permanent ventilation (i.e., event-free 
survival) to ≥10.5 months of age, 20 patients survived to ≥14 months of age (co-primary efficacy 
endpoint), and 20 patients survived event-free to 18 months of age. 
Three patients did not complete the study, of which 2 patients had an event (death or permanent 
ventilation) leading to 90.9% (95% CI: 79.7%, 100.0%) event-free survival (alive without permanent 
ventilation) at 14 months of age, see Figure 1.

For the 14 patients in Study CL-303 that achieved the milestone of independent sitting for at least 
30 seconds at any visit during the study, the median age when this milestone was first demonstrated 
was 12.6 months (range: 9.2 to 18.6 months). Thirteen patients (59.1%) confirmed the milestone of 
independent sitting for at least 30 seconds at the 18-month visit (co-primary endpoint, p<0.0001). One 
patient achieved the milestone of sitting independently for 30 seconds at 16 months of age, but this 
milestone was not confirmed at the Month 18 visit. The video-confirmed developmental milestones for 
patients in Study CL-303 are summarised in Table 4. Three patients did not achieve any motor 
milestones (13.6%) and another 3 patients (13.6%) achieved head control as the maximum motor 
milestone before the 18 months of age final study visit.

One patient (4.5%) could also walk with assistance at 12.9 months. Based on the natural history of the 
disease, patients who met the study entry criteria would not be expected to attain the ability to sit 
without support. In addition, 18 of the 22 patients were independent of ventilatory support at 
18 months of age. 
Motor function improvements were also observed as measured by the CHOP-INTEND, see Figure 2. 
Twenty-one patients (95.5%) achieved a CHOP-INTEND score ≥ 40, 14 patients (63.6%) had 
achieved a CHOP-INTEND score ≥ 50, and 9 patients (40.9%) had achieved a CHOP-INTEND score 
≥ 58. Patients with untreated SMA Type 1 almost never achieve a CHOP-INTEND score ≥ 40. Motor 
milestone achievement was observed in some patients despite plateauing of CHOP-INTEND. No clear 
correlation was observed between CHOP-INTEND scores and motor milestone achievement.

AVXS-101-CL-302 Phase 3 study in patients with Type 1 SMA 
Age (months) 
AVXS-101-CL-302 (Study CL-302) is a Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, single-dose study of 
intravenous administration of onasemnogene abeparvovec at the therapeutic dose (1.1 × 1014 vg/kg). 
Thirty-three patients were enrolled with Type 1 SMA and 2 copies of SMN2. Before treatment with 
onasemnogene abeparvovec, 9 patients (27.3%) reported ventilatory support and 9 patients (27.3%) 
reported feeding support. The mean CHOP-INTEND score of the 33 patients at baseline was 27.9 
(range, 14 to 55). The mean age of the 33 patients at the time of treatment was 4.1 months (range, 1.8 
to 6.0 months). 
Of the 33 enrolled patients (Efficacy Completers population), one patient (3%) was dosed outside of 
protocol age range and was therefore not included in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Of the 
32 patients in the ITT population, one patient (3%) died during the study, due to disease progression. 
Of the 32 patients in the ITT population, 14 patients (43.8%) achieved the milestone of sitting without 
support for at least 10 seconds at any visit up to and including the 18 month visit (primary efficacy 
endpoint). The median age when this milestone was first achieved was 15.9 months (range, 7.7 to 
18.6 months). Thirty-one patients (96.9%) in the ITT population survived without permanent 
ventilation (i.e., event-free survival) to ≥ 14 months of age (secondary efficacy endpoint). 
The additional video-confirmed developmental milestones for patients in the Efficacy Completers 
population in Study CL-302 at any visit up to and including the 18 month visit are summarised in

AVXS-101-CL-101 Phase 1 study in patients with Type 1 SMA 
The results seen in Study CL-303 are supported by study AVXS-101-CL-101 (Study CL-101) a 
phase 1 study in patients with Type 1 SMA, in which onasemnogene abeparvovec was administered as 
a single intravenous infusion in 12 patients from 3.6 kg to 8.4 kg (0.9 to 7.9 months of age). At 
14 months of age, all treated patients were event-free; i.e. survived without permanent ventilation, 
compared to 25% in the natural history cohort. At the end of the study (24 months post-dose), all 
treated patients were event-free, compared to less than 8% in the natural history, see Figure 1. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At 24 months of follow up post-dose, 10 out of 12 patients were able to sit without support for 
≥ 10 seconds, 9 patients were able to sit without support for ≥ 30 seconds and 2 patients were able to 
stand and walk without assistance. One out of 12 patients did not achieve head control as the 
maximum motor milestone before the age of 24 months. Ten of 12 patients from Study CL-101 
continue to be followed in a long-term study (for up to 6.6 years after dosing) and all 10 patients were 
alive and free of permanent ventilation as of 23 May 2021. All patients have either maintained 
previously attained milestones or gained new milestones such as sitting with support, standing with 
assistance and walking alone. Five of the 10 patients received concomitant nusinersen or risdiplam 
treatment at some point during the long-term study. Maintenance of efficacy and achievement of 
milestones can therefore not be solely attributed to onasemnogene abeparvovec in all patients. The 
milestone of standing with assistance was newly acquired by 2 patients who had not received 
nusinersen or risdiplam at any point prior to the time this milestone was achieved. 
AVXS-101-CL-304 Phase 3 study in patients with pre-symptomatic SMA 
Study CL-304 is a global, Phase 3, open-label, single-arm, single-dose study of intravenous 
administration of onasemnogene abeparvovec in pre-symptomatic newborn patients up to 6 weeks of 
age with 2 (cohort 1, n=14) or 3 (cohort 2, n=15) copies of SMN2. 
Cohort 1 
The 14 treated patients with 2 copies of SMN2 were followed to 18 months of age. All patients 
survived event-free to ≥ 14 months of age without permanent ventilation. 
All 14 patients achieved independent sitting for at least 30 seconds at any visit up to the 18 months of 
age visit (primary efficacy endpoint), at ages ranging from 5.7 to 11.8 months, with 11 of the 
14 patients who achieved independent sitting at or before 279 days of age, the 99th percentile for 
development of this milestone. Nine patients achieved the milestone of walking alone (64.3%). All 
14 patients achieved a CHOP-INTEND score ≥ 58 at any visit up to the 18 months of age visit. No 
patients required any ventilatory support or any feeding support during the study. 
Cohort 2 
The 15 treated patients with 3 copies of SMN2 were followed to 24 months of age. All patients 
survived event-free to 24 months of age without permanent ventilation. 
All 15 patients were able to stand alone without support for at least 3 seconds (primary efficacy 
endpoint), at ages ranging from 9.5 to 18.3 months, with 14 of the 15 patients who achieved standing 
alone at or before 514 days of age, the 99th percentile for development of this milestone. Fourteen 
patients (93.3%) were able to walk at least five steps independently. All 15 patients achieved a scaled 
score of ≥ 4 on Bayley-III Gross and Fine Motor Subtests within 2 standard deviations of the mean for 
age at any post-baseline visit up to 24 months of age. No patients required any ventilatory support or 
any feeding support during the study. 
Onasemnogene abeparvovec has not been studied in patients with a bi-allelic mutation of the 
SMN1 gene and only one copy of SMN2 in clinical studies. 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
onasemnogene abeparvovec in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in spinal muscular 
atrophy for the granted indication (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Onasemnogene abeparvovec vector shedding studies, which assess the amount of vector eliminated 
from the body through saliva, urine and faeces were performed. 
Onasemnogene abeparvovec was detectable in shedding samples post-infusion. Clearance of 
onasemnogene abeparvovec was primarily via faeces and the majority is cleared within 30 days after 
dose administration. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Biodistribution was evaluated in 2 patients who died 5.7 months and 1.7 months, respectively, after 
infusion of onasemnogene abeparvovec at the dose of 1.1 x 1014 vg/kg. Both cases showed that the 
highest levels of vector DNA were found in the liver. Vector DNA was also detected in the spleen, 
heart, pancreas, inguinal lymph node, skeletal muscles, peripheral nerves, kidney, lung, intestines, 
gonads, spinal cord, brain, and thymus. Immunostaining for SMN protein showed generalized SMN 
expression in spinal motor neurons, neuronal and glial cells of the brain, and in the heart, liver, 
skeletal muscles, and other tissues evaluated. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Following intravenous administration in neonatal mice, vector was widely distributed, with the highest 
vector DNA levels generally detected in the heart, liver, lungs and skeletal muscle. The expression of 
transgene mRNA showed similar patterns. Following intravenous administration in juvenile 
non-human primates, vector was widely distributed with subsequent expression of transgene mRNA, 
with the highest concentrations of vector DNA and transgene mRNA tending to occur in the liver, 
muscle, and heart. Vector DNA and transgene mRNA in both species was detected in the spinal cord, 
brain, and gonads. 
In pivotal 3-month mouse toxicology studies, the main target organs of toxicity identified were the 
heart and liver. Onasemnogene abeparvovec-related findings in the ventricles of the heart were 
comprised of dose-related inflammation, oedema and fibrosis. In the atria of the heart, inflammation, 
thrombosis, myocardial degeneration/necrosis and fibroplasia were observed. A No Adverse Effect 
Level (NoAEL) was not identified for onasemnogene abeparvovec in mouse studies as ventricular 
myocardial inflammation/oedema/fibrosis and atrial inflammation were observed at the lowest dose 
tested (1.5 × 1014 vg/kg). This dose is regarded as the Maximum Tolerated Dose and approximately 
1.4-fold the recommended clinical dose. Onasemnogene abeparvovec-related mortality was, in the 
majority of mice, associated with atrial thrombosis, and observed at 2.4 × 1014 vg/kg. The cause of the 
mortality in the rest of the animals was undetermined, although microscopic degeneration/regeneration 
in the hearts of these animals was found. 
Liver findings in mice were comprised of hepatocellular hypertrophy, Kupffer cell activation, and 
scattered hepatocellular necrosis. In long-term toxicity studies with intravenous and intrathecal (not 
indicated for use) administration of onasemnogene abeparvovec in juvenile non-human primates, liver 
findings, including single cell necrosis of hepatocytes and oval cell hyperplasia, demonstrated partial 
(IV) or complete (IT) reversibility. 
In a 6-month toxicology study conducted in juvenile non-human primates, administration of a single 
dose of onasemnogene abeparvovec at the clinically recommended intravenous dose, with or without 
corticosteroid treatment, resulted in acute, minimal to slight mononuclear cell inflammation and 
neuronal degeneration in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) and trigeminal ganglia (TG), as well as axonal 
degeneration and/or gliosis in the spinal cord. At 6 months, these non-progressive findings resulted in 
full resolution in the TG, and partial resolution (decreased incidence and/or severity) in the DRG and 
spinal cord. Following intrathecal administration of onasemnogene abeparvovec (not indicated for 
use), these acute, non-progressive findings were noted with minimal to moderate severity in juvenile 
non-human primates with partial to full resolution at 12 months. These findings in non-human 
primates had no correlative clinical observations, therefore the clinical relevance in humans is 
unknown. 
Genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and reproduction toxicity studies have not been conducted with 
onasemnogene abeparvovec.

• 
Risk management plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities 
and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation 
and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
• 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached. 
• 
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to use of Zolgensma in each Member State the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) must 
agree about the content and format of the educational programme, including communication media, 
distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the programme, with the National Competent 
Authority (NCA). 
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State (MS) where Zolgensma is marketed, healthcare 
professionals (HCP) who are expected to prescribe, dispense and administer Zolgensma are provided 
with the following Healthcare Professional Information Pack: 
- 
- 
SmPC 
Healthcare professional guide 
The healthcare professional guide shall contain the following key messages: 
• 
Before the start of treatment: 
o 
o 
The HCP should evaluate the patient’s vaccination schedule; 
Inform the caregiver(s) about the main risks with Zolgensma and their signs and 
symptoms, including TMA, hepatic failure and thrombocytopenia; about the need for 
regular blood sampling; the importance of corticosteroid medication; practical advice 
concerning bodily waste disposal; 
Inform the caregiver(s) of the need for increased vigilance in the prevention, monitoring, 
and management of infection before and after Zolgensma infusion; 
Patients should be tested for the presence of AAV9 antibodies; 
• 
• 
o 
At the time of infusion: 
o 
o 
After infusion: 
o 
Check if the overall health status of the patient is suitable for the infusion (e.g. resolution 
of infections) or if a postponement is warranted; 
Check that corticosteroid treatment was started before the infusion of Zolgensma. 
The corticosteroid treatment should continue for at least 2 months; and not be tapered 
until AST/ALT are less than 2 x ULN, and all other assessments, e.g. total bilirubin, 
return to normal range; 
Close and regular monitoring (clinical and laboratory) of the individual patient course 
should be performed for at least 3 months; 
Prompt assessment of patients with worsening liver function tests and/or signs or 
symptoms of acute illness; 
If patients do not respond adequately to corticosteroids, or if liver injury is suspected, 
HCP should consult a paediatric gastroenterologist or hepatologist; 
If TMA is suspected, a specialist should be consulted. 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The MAH shall ensure that in each Member State (MS) where Zolgensma is marketed, all caregivers 
of patients in whom Zolgensma treatment is planned or who have received Zolgensma are provided 
with the following Patient Information Pack: 
- 
- 
Package Leaflet 
Caregiver information guide 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The patient information pack shall contain the following key messages: 
•  What is SMA. 
•  What is Zolgensma and how it works. 
• 
Understanding the risks of Zolgensma. 
• 
Treatment with Zolgensma: important information before, on the day of infusion and after 
treatment, including when to seek medical attention. 
It is recommended that patients present an adequate overall health status (e.g. hydration and 
nutritional status, absence of infection) prior to Zolgensma treatment, otherwise treatment may 
need to be postponed. 
Zolgensma may increase the risk of abnormal clotting of blood in small blood vessels 
(thrombotic microangiopathy). Cases generally occurred within the first two weeks after 
onasemnogene abeparvovec infusion. Thrombotic microangiopathy is serious and may lead to 
death. Tell your doctor immediately if you notice signs and symptoms such as bruising, seizures 
or decrease in urine output. Your child will have a regular blood test to check any decrease of 
platelets, the cells responsible for clotting, for at least 3 months after treatment. Depending on 
the values and other signs and symptoms, further evaluations may be required. 
Zolgensma can lower blood-platelet counts (thrombocytopenia). Cases generally occurred 
within the first two weeks after onasemnogene abeparvovec infusion. Possible signs of a low 
blood-platelet count you need to look out for after your child is given Zolgensma include 
abnormal bruising or bleeding. Speak to your doctor if you see signs such as bruising or 
bleeding for longer than usual if your child has been hurt. 
Zolgensma can lead to an increase in enzymes (proteins found within the body) produced by the 
liver. In some cases, Zolgensma can affect the function of the liver and lead to injury of the 
liver. Injury to the liver can lead to serious outcomes, including liver failure and death. Possible 
signs you need to look out for after your child is given this medicine include vomiting, jaundice 
(yellowing of the skin or of the whites of the eyes), or reduced alertness. Tell your child’s 
doctor straightaway if you notice your child develops any symptoms suggestive of injury to the 
liver. Your child will have a blood test to check how well the liver is working before starting 
treatment with Zolgensma. Your child will also have regular blood tests for at least 3 months 
after treatment to monitor for increases in liver enzymes. Depending on the values and other 
signs and symptoms, further evaluations may be required. 
Your child will be given a corticosteroid medicine such as prednisolone before treatment with 
Zolgensma, and for about 2 months or longer after Zolgensma treatment. The corticosteroid 
medicine will help manage effects of Zolgensma such as increase in liver enzymes that your 
child could develop after treatment with Zolgensma. 
Tell your doctor in the event of vomiting before or after treatment with Zolgensma, to make 
sure that your child does not miss corticosteroid dosing. 
Before and after treatment with Zolgensma it is important to prevent infections by avoiding 
situations that may increase the risk of the child getting infections. Caregivers and close 
contacts with the patient should follow infection prevention practices (e.g. hand hygiene, 
coughing/sneezing etiquette, limiting potential contacts). Inform the doctor straightaway in case 
of signs and symptoms suggestive of infection, such as respiratory infection (coughing, 
wheezing, sneezing, runny nose, sore throat or fever) prior to infusion as the infusion may need 
to be delayed until the infection is resolved, or after treatment with Zolgensma as it may lead to 
medical complications that may require urgent medical attention. 
Useful further information (supportive care, local associations).

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Zolgensma is and what it is used for 
What Zolgensma is 
Zolgensma is a type of medicine called a ‘gene therapy’. It contains the active substance 
onasemnogene abeparvovec, which contains human genetic material. 
What Zolgensma is used for 
Zolgensma is used to treat spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a rare, serious inherited disease. 
How Zolgensma works 
SMA occurs when there is a missing or abnormal version of a gene needed to make an essential 
protein called ‘Survival Motor Neuron’ (SMN) protein. Lack of SMN protein causes nerves that 
control muscles (motor neurons) to die. This results in muscles becoming weak and wasting away, 
with eventual loss of movement. 
This medicine works by supplying a fully functioning copy of the SMN gene which then helps the 
body produce enough SMN protein. The gene is delivered into the cells where it is needed using a 
modified virus that does not cause disease in humans.

2.  What you need to know before your child is given Zolgensma 
Do NOT use Zolgensma 
• 
if your child is allergic to onasemnogene abeparvovec or any of the other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Your child’s doctor will check for antibodies before treatment to help decide if this medicine is 
suitable for your child. 
Liver problems 
Talk to your child’s doctor or nurse before this medicine is given if your child has had any liver 
problems. This medicine can lead to an increase in enzymes (proteins found within the body) produced 
by the liver or injury to the liver. Injury to the liver can lead to serious outcomes, including liver 
failure and death. Possible signs you need to look out for after your child is given this medicine 
include vomiting, jaundice (yellowing of the skin or of the whites of the eyes), or reduced alertness 
(see section 4 for more information). Tell your child’s doctor straightaway if you notice your child 
develops any symptoms suggestive of injury to the liver. 
Your child will have a blood test to check how well the liver is working before starting treatment with 
Zolgensma. Your child will also have regular blood tests for at least 3 months after treatment to 
monitor for increases in liver enzymes. 
Infection 
An infection (e.g. cold, flu or bronchiolitis) before or after Zolgensma treatment may lead to more 
serious complications. Caregivers and close contacts with the patient should follow infection 
prevention practices (e.g. hand hygiene, coughing/sneezing etiquette, limiting potential contacts). You 
need to look out for signs of an infection such as coughing, wheezing, sneezing, runny nose, sore 
throat or fever. Tell your child’s doctor straightaway if you notice your child develops any symptoms 
suggestive of infection before or after Zolgensma treatment. 
Regular blood tests 
This medicine can lower blood-platelet counts (thrombocytopenia). You need to look out for possible 
signs of a low blood-platelet count after your child is given Zolgensma such as abnormal bruising or 
bleeding (see section 4 for more information). Most of the reported cases of a low blood-platelet count 
occurred within the first two weeks after the child was given Zolgensma. 
Zolgensma can raise levels of a heart protein called troponin-I that may indicate injury to the heart. 
You need to look out for possible signs of heart problems after your child is given this medicine, such 
as pale grey or blue skin colour, difficulty in breathing, swelling of the arms and legs or of the belly 
(see section 4 for more information). 
Before starting treatment with Zolgensma, your child will have a blood test to check the amount of 
blood cells (including red blood cells and platelets), as well as troponin-I level in their body. They will 
also have a blood test to check their creatinine level, which is an indicator of how the kidneys are 
working. Your child will also have regular blood tests for a period of time after treatment to monitor 
for changes in platelets and troponin-I levels. 
Abnormal clotting of blood in small blood vessels (thrombotic microangiopathy) 
There have been reports of patients developing thrombotic microangiopathy generally within the first 
two weeks after Zolgensma treatment. Thrombotic microangiopathy is accompanied by a decrease in 
red blood cells and cells involved in clotting (platelets) and can be fatal. These blood clots could affect 
your child’s kidneys. Your child’s doctor may want to check your child’s blood (platelet counts) and 
blood pressure. Possible signs you need to look out for after your child is given Zolgensma include 
bruising easily, seizures (fits) or decrease in urine output (see section 4 for more information). Seek 
urgent medical attention if your child develops any of these signs. 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Blood, organ, tissue and cell donation 
After your child has been treated with Zolgensma, they will not be able to donate blood, organs, 
tissues or cells. This is because Zolgensma is a gene therapy medicine. 
Other medicines and Zolgensma 
Tell your child’s doctor or nurse if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Prednisolone 
Your child will also be given a corticosteroid medicine such as prednisolone for about 2 months or 
longer (see also section 3) as part of Zolgensma treatment. The corticosteroid medicine will help 
manage any increase in liver enzymes that your child could develop after being given Zolgensma. 
Vaccinations 
As corticosteroids can affect the body’s immune (defense) system, your child’s doctor may decide to 
delay giving some vaccinations while your child is receiving corticosteroid treatment. Talk to your 
child’s doctor or nurse if you have any questions. 
Zolgensma contains sodium 
This medicine contains 4.6 mg sodium per mL, equivalent to 0.23% of the WHO recommended 
maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. Each 5.5-mL vial contains 25.3 mg sodium, and 
each 8.3-mL vial contains 38.2 mg sodium. 
Additional information for parents/caregiver 
Advanced SMA 
Zolgensma can rescue living motor neurons, but does not rescue dead motor neurons. Children with 
less severe symptoms of SMA (such as absent reflexes or reduced muscle tone) may have sufficient 
living motor neurons to benefit significantly from Zolgensma treatment. Zolgensma may not work as 
well in children with severe muscle weakness or paralysis, breathing problems or who are not able to 
swallow, or in children who have significant malformations (such as heart defects), including patients 
with SMA Type 0, as there may be limited potential improvement after treatment with Zolgensma. 
Your child’s doctor will decide if your child should be given this medicine. 
Risk of tumours associated with potential insertion into the DNA 
There is a possibility that therapies such as Zolgensma can insert into the DNA of human body cells. 
As a consequence, Zolgensma could contribute to a risk of tumours because of the nature of the 
medicine. You should discuss this with your child’s doctor. In the event of a tumour, your child’s 
doctor may take a sample for further evaluation. 
Hygiene care 
The active substance in Zolgensma may temporarily be excreted through your child’s bodily waste; 
this is called ‘shedding’. Parents and caregivers should follow good hand-hygiene for up to 1 month 
after your child is given Zolgensma. Wear protective gloves when coming into direct contact with 
your child’s bodily fluids or waste and wash hands thoroughly afterwards with soap and warm running 
water, or an alcohol-based hand sanitiser. Double bags should be used to dispose of soiled nappies and 
other waste. Disposable nappies may still be disposed of in household waste. 
You should continue to follow these instructions for at least 1 month after your child’s treatment with 
Zolgensma. Talk to your child’s doctor or nurse if you have any questions. 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. 
How Zolgensma is given 
Zolgensma will be given by a doctor or nurse trained in the management of your child’s condition. 
The doctor will work out the amount of Zolgensma your child will receive according to your child’s 
weight. Zolgensma is given intravenously (into a vein) by a single infusion (drip) over about 1 hour. 
Zolgensma will be given to your child ONCE only. 
Your child will also be given prednisolone (or another corticosteroid) by mouth, starting 24 hours 
before being given Zolgensma. The dose of corticosteroid will also depend on your child’s weight. 
Your child’s doctor will work out the total dose to give. 
Your child will be given corticosteroid treatment daily for about 2 months after the dose of 
Zolgensma, or until your child’s liver enzymes decrease to an acceptable level. The doctor will slowly 
reduce the dose of corticosteroid until treatment can be fully stopped. 
If you have any further questions ask your child’s doctor or nurse. 
4.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Important: Please refer to the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) before using. 
Each vial is for single use only. 
This medicinal product contains genetically-modified organisms. Local guidelines on handling of 
biological waste should be followed. 
Handling 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Zolgensma should be handled aseptically under sterile conditions. 
Personal protective equipment (including gloves, safety goggles, laboratory coat and sleeves) 
should be worn while handling or administering Zolgensma. Personnel should not work with 
Zolgensma if skin is cut or scratched. 
All spills of Zolgensma must be wiped with absorbent gauze pads and the spill area must be 
disinfected using a bleach solution followed by alcohol wipes. All clean-up materials must be 
double bagged and disposed of in accordance with local guidelines on handling of biological 
waste. 
All materials that may have come in contact with Zolgensma (e.g. vial, all materials used for 
injection, including sterile drapes and needles) must be disposed of in accordance with local 
guidelines on handling of biological waste. 
Accidental exposure 
Accidental exposure to Zolgensma must be avoided. 
In case of accidental exposure to skin, the affected area must be thoroughly cleansed with soap and 
water for at least 15 minutes. In case of accidental exposure to eyes, the affected area must be 
thoroughly flushed with water for at least 15 minutes. 
Storage 
Vials will be transported frozen (at or below -60ºC). Upon receipt vials should be refrigerated at 
2°C to 8°C immediately, and in the original carton. Zolgensma therapy should be initiated within 
14 days of receipt of vials. The date of receipt should be marked on the original carton before the 
product is stored in the refrigerator. 
Preparation 
Vials should be thawed before use: 
• 
For packs containing up to 9 vials – thaw for approximately 12 hours in the refrigerator (2ºC to 
8ºC) or 4 hours at room temperature (20°C to 25°C). 
For packs containing up to 14 vials – thaw for approximately 16 hours in the refrigerator (2ºC to 
8ºC) or 6 hours at room temperature (20°C to 25°C). 
• 
Do not use Zolgensma unless thawed. 
Once thawed, the medicinal product should not be re-frozen. 
After thawing, gently swirl Zolgensma. Do NOT shake. 
Do not use this medicine if you notice any particles or discoloration once the frozen product has 
thawed and prior to administration. 
After thawing, Zolgensma should be given as soon as possible. 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Administration 
Zolgensma should be given to patients ONCE only. 
The dose of Zolgensma and exact number of vials required for each patient is calculated according to 
the patient’s weight (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 6.5). 
To administer Zolgensma, draw the entire dose volume into the syringe. Once the dose volume is 
drawn into the syringe it must be administered within 8 hours. Remove any air in the syringe before 
administering to the patient via intravenous infusion through a venous catheter. Insertion of a 
secondary (‘back-up’) catheter is recommended in case of blockage in the primary catheter. 
Zolgensma should be administered with the syringe pump as a single intravenous infusion with a slow 
infusion of approximately 60 minutes. It should be administered as an intravenous infusion only. It 
should not be administered as a rapid intravenous injection or bolus. Following completion of 
infusion, the line should be flushed with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection. 
Disposal 
Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
guidelines on handling of biological waste. 
Temporary Zolgensma shedding may occur, primarily through bodily waste. Caregivers and patient’s 
families should be advised on the following instructions for the proper handling of patients’ bodily 
fluids and waste: 
• 
Good hand-hygiene (wearing protective gloves and washing hands thoroughly afterwards with 
soap and warm running water, or an alcohol-based hand sanitiser) is required when coming into 
direct contact with patient’s bodily fluids and waste for a minimum of 1 month after Zolgensma 
treatment. 
Disposable nappies should be sealed in double plastics bags and can be disposed of in 
household waste.

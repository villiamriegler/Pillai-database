1. 
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
CYSTAGON 50 mg hard capsules 
2. 
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
Each hard capsule contains 50 mg of cysteamine (as mercaptamine bitartrate) . 
For a full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Hard Capsule 
White, opaque hard capsules with CYSTA 50 on the body and RECORDATI RARE DISEASES on 
the cap. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indication 
CYSTAGON is indicated for the treatment of proven nephropathic cystinosis. Cysteamine reduces 
cystine accumulation in some cells (e.g. leukocytes, muscle and liver cells) of nephropathic cystinosis 
patients and, when treatment is started early, it delays the development of renal failure. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
CYSTAGON treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the 
treatment of cystinosis. 
The goal of therapy is to keep leucocyte cystine levels below 1 nmol hemicystine/mg protein. White 
blood cell (WBC) cystine levels should therefore be monitored to adjust the dose. The WBC levels 
should be measured 5 to 6 hours after dosing and should be checked frequently when initiating therapy 
(e.g. monthly) and every 3-4 months when on a stable dose. 
• 
• 
For children up to age 12 years, CYSTAGON dosing should be on the basis of body surface 
area (g/m2/day). The recommended dose is 1.30 g/m2/day of the free base divided four times 
daily.  
For patients over age 12 and over 50 kg weight, the recommended CYSTAGON dose is 
2 g/day, divided four times daily. 
Starting doses should be 1/4 to 1/6 of the expected maintenance dose, increased gradually over 4-
6 weeks to avoid intolerance. The dose should be raised if there is adequate tolerance and the 
leucocyte cystine level remains >1 nmol hemicystine/mg protein. The maximum dose of CYSTAGON 
used in clinical trials was 1.95 g/m2/day. 
The use of doses higher than 1.95 g/m2/day is not recommended (see section 4.4). 
Digestive tolerance of cysteamine is improved when the medicinal product is taken just after or with 
food. 
In children who are at risk of aspiration, aged approximately 6 years and under, the hard capsules 
should be opened and the content sprinkled on food. Experience suggests that foods such as milk, 
potatoes and other starch based products seem to be appropriate for mixing with the powder. However, 
acidic drinks, e.g. orange juice, should generally be avoided as the powder tends not to mix well and 
may precipitate out.

Patients on dialysis or post-transplantation: 
Experience has occasionally shown that some forms of cysteamine are less well tolerated (i.e.leading 
to more adverse events) when patients are on dialysis. A closer monitoring of the leucocyte cystine 
levels is recommended in these patients. 
Patients with hepatic insufficiency: 
Dose adjustment is not normally required; however, leucocyte cystine levels should be monitored. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients 
The use of CYSTAGON is contra-indicated during breast-feeding. CYSTAGON should not be used 
during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester, unless clearly necessary (see section 4.6 and 
section 5.3 as it is teratogenic in animals. 
CYSTAGON is contraindicated in patients who have developed hypersensitivity to penicillamine. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
CYSTAGON therapy must be initiated promptly after confirmation of the diagnosis of nephropathic 
cystinosis to achieve maximum benefit. 
Nephropathic cystinosis must have been diagnosed by both clinical signs and biochemical 
investigations (leucocyte cystine measurements). 
Cases of Ehlers-Danlos like syndrome and vascular disorders on elbows have been reported in 
children treated with high doses of different cysteamine preparations (cysteamine chlorhydrate or 
cystamine or cysteamine bitartrate) mostly above the maximal dose 1.95 g/m2/day. These skin lesions 
were associated with vascular proliferation, skin striae and bone lesions. 
It is therefore recommended to monitor regularly skin and to consider X-ray examinations of the bone 
as necessary. Self-examination of the skin by the patient or the parents should also be advised. If any 
similar skin or bone abnormalities appear, it is recommended to decrease the dose of CYSTAGON. 
The use of doses higher than 1.95g/m2/day is not recommended (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Monitoring of blood cell count is recommended on a regular basis. 
Oral cysteamine has not been shown to prevent eye deposition of cystine crystals. Therefore, where 
cysteamine ophthalmic solution is used for that purpose, its usage should continue. 
In contrast to phosphocysteamine, CYSTAGON does not contain phosphate. Most patients will 
already be receiving phosphate supplements and the dose of these may need to be altered when 
CYSTAGON is substituted for phosphocysteamine. 
Intact CYSTAGON hard capsules should not be administered to children under the age of 
approximately 6 years due to risk of aspiration (see section 4.2). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed 
CYSTAGON can be administered with electrolyte and mineral replacements necessary for 
management of the Fanconi syndrome as well as vitamin D and thyroid hormones. Indomethacin and 
CYSTAGON have been used simultaneously in some patients. In cases of patients with kidney 
transplants, anti-rejection treatments have been used with cysteamine.

4.6  Pregnancy and lactation 
There are no adequate data from the use of cysteamine bitartrate in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity, including teratogenesis (see section 5.3). The potential risk 
for humans is unknown. The effect on pregnancy of untreated cystinosis is also unknown. 
Therefore, CYSTAGON should not be used during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester, 
unless clearly necessary. 
If a pregnancy is diagnosed or planned, the treatment should be carefully reconsidered and the patient 
must be advised of the possible teratogenic risk of cysteamine. 
CYSTAGON excretion in human's milk is unknown. However, due to the results of animal studies in 
breast-feeding mothers and neonates (see section 5.3), breast-feeding is contraindicated in women 
taking CYSTAGON.  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
CYSTAGON has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines 
CYSTAGON may cause drowsiness. When starting therapy, patients should not engage in potentially 
hazardous activities until the effects of the medicinal product on each individual are known. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Approximately 35% of patients can be expected to experience adverse reactions. These mainly involve 
the  gastrointestinal  and  central  nervous  systems.  When  these  effects  appear  at  the  initiation  of 
cysteamine therapy, temporary suspension and gradual reintroduction of treatment may be effective in 
improving tolerance. 
Reported adverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are 
defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥1/100 to 1/10) and uncommon (≥1/1,000 to 1/100). 
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriouness

Cases of nephrotic syndrome have been reported within 6 months of starting therapy with progressive 
recovery after treatment discontinuation. In some cases, histology showed a membranous 
glomerulonephritis of the renal allograft and hypersensitivity interstitial nephritis. 
Cases of Ehlers-Danlos like syndrome and vascular disorders on elbows have been reported in 
children chronically treated with high doses of different cysteamine preparations (cysteamine 
chlorhydrate or cystamine or cysteamine bitartrate) mostly above the maximal dose 1.95 g/m2/day. 
In some cases, these skin lesions were associated with vascular proliferation, skin striae and bone 
lesions first seen during an X-ray examination. Bone disorders reported were genu valgum, leg pain 
and hyperextensive joints, osteopenia, compression fractures, and scoliosis. 
In cases where histopathological examination of the skin was performed, the results suggested 
angioendotheliomatosis. 
One patient subsequently died of acute cerebral ischemia with marked vasculopathy.  
In some patients, the skin lesions on elbows regressed after CYSTAGON dose reduction. 
Cysteamine mechanism of action by interfering with the cross-linking of collagen fibers has been 
postulated (see section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
An overdose of cysteamine may cause progressive lethargy. 
Should  overdosage  occur,  the  respiratory  and  cardiovascular  systems  should  be  supported 
appropriately.  No  specific  antidote  is  known.  It  is  not  known  if  cysteamine  is  removed  by 
haemodialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Alimentary tract and metabolism product, ATC code: A16AA04.  
Normal individuals and heterozygous subjects for cystinosis have white cell cystine levels of < 0.2, 
and usually below 1 nmol hemicystine/mg protein, respectively. Individuals with nephropathic 
cystinosis have elevations of white cell cystine above 2 nmol hemicystine/mg protein 
Cysteamine reacts with cystine to form the mixed disulfide of cysteamine and cysteine.  
The mixed disulfide is then exported from the lysosomes by an intact lysine transport system. The 
decrease in leucocyte cystine levels is correlated to the cysteamine plasma concentration over the six 
hours following the administration of CYSTAGON.  
The leucocyte cystine level reaches its minimum (mean ( sd) value: 1.8  0.8 hours) slightly later 
than the peak plasma cysteamine concentration (mean ( sd) value: 1.4  0.4 hours) and returns to its 
baseline level as the plasma cysteamine concentration decreases at 6 hours post-dose. 
In one clinical study, baseline white cell cystine levels were 3.73 (range 0.13 to 19.8) nmol 
hemicystine/mg protein and were maintained close to 1 nmol hemicystine/mg protein with a 
cysteamine dose range of 1.3 to 1.95 g/m2/day.  
An earlier study treated 94 children with nephropathic cystinosis with increasing doses of cysteamine 
to attain white cell cystine levels of less than 2 nmol hemicystine/mg protein 5 to 6 hours post-dose, 
and compared their outcome with an historical control group of 17 children treated with placebo. The 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
principal efficacy measurements were serum creatinine and calculated creatinine clearance and growth 
(height). The mean white cell cystine level attained during treatment was 1.7 + 0.2 nmol 
hemicystine/mg protein. Among cysteamine patients, glomerular function was maintained over time. 
Placebo treated patients, in contrast, experienced a gradual rise in serum creatinine. Patients on 
treatment maintained growth as compared to untreated patients. However, growth velocity did not 
increase enough to allow patients to catch up the normal for their age. Renal tubular function was not 
affected by treatment. Two other studies have shown similar results. 
In all studies, patient response was better when treatment was started at an early age with good renal 
function. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Following a single oral dose of cysteamine bitartrate equivalent to 1.05 g of cysteamine free base in 
healthy volunteers, the mean ( sd) values for the time to peak and peak plasma concentration are 1.4 
( 0.5) hours and 4.0 ( 1.0) µg/ml, respectively. In patients at steady state, these values are 1.4 ( 0.4) 
hours and 2.6 ( 0.9) µg/ml, respectively, after a dose ranging from 225 to 550 mg. 
Cysteamine bitartrate (CYSTAGON) is bioequivalent to cysteamine hydrochloride and 
phosphocysteamine. 
The in vitro plasma protein binding of cysteamine, which is mostly to albumin, is independent of 
plasma drug concentration over the therapeutic range, with a mean ( sd) value of 54.1 % ( 1.5). The 
plasma protein binding in patients at steady state is similar: 53.1 % ( 3.6) and 51.1 % ( 4.5) at 1.5 
and 6 hours post-dose, respectively. 
In a pharmacokinetic study performed in 24 healthy volunteers for 24 hours, the mean estimate ( sd) 
for the terminal half-life of elimination was 4.8 ( 1.8) hours. 
The elimination of unchanged cysteamine in the urine has been shown to range between 0.3 % and 
1.7% of the total daily dose in four patients; the bulk of cysteamine is excreted as sulphate. 
Very limited data suggest that cysteamine pharmacokinetic parameters may not be significantly 
modified in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency. No information is available for patients 
with severe renal insufficiency. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Genotoxicity studies have been performed: although in published studies using cysteamine, induction 
of chromosome aberrations in cultured eukaryotic cell lines has been reported, specific studies with 
cysteamine bitartrate did not show any mutagenic effects in the Ames test or any clastogenic effect in 
the mouse micronucleus test.  
Reproduction studies showed embryofoetotoxic effects (resorptions and post-implantation losses) in 
rats at the 100 mg/kg/day dose level and in rabbits receiving cysteamine 50 mg/kg/day. Teratogenic 
effects have been described in rats when cysteamine is administered over the period of organogenesis 
at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day.  
This is equivalent to 0.6 g/m2/day in the rat, which is less than half the recommended clinical 
maintenance dose of cysteamine, i.e. 1.30 g/ m2/day. A reduction of fertility was observed in rats at 
375 mg/kg/day, a dose at which body weight gain was retarded. At this dose, weight gain and survival 
of the offspring during lactation was also reduced. High doses of cysteamine impair the ability of 
lactating mothers to feed their pups. Single doses of the drug inhibit prolactin secretion in animals. 
Administration of cysteamine in neonate rats induced cataracts. 
High doses of cysteamine, either by oral or parenteral routes, produce duodenal ulcers in rats and mice 
but not in monkeys.  Experimental administration of the drug causes depletion of somatostatin in 
several animal species. The consequence of this for the clinical use of the drug is unknown.  
No carcinogenic studies have been conducted with CYSTAGON.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indication 
CYSTAGON is indicated for the treatment of proven nephropathic cystinosis. Cysteamine reduces 
cystine accumulation in some cells (e.g. leukocytes, muscle and liver cells) of nephropathic cystinosis 
patients and, when treatment is started early, it delays the development of renal failure. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
CYSTAGON treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the 
treatment of cystinosis. 
The goal of therapy is to keep leucocyte cystine levels below 1 nmol hemicystine/mg protein. White 
blood cell (WBC) cystine levels should therefore be monitored to adjust the dose. The WBC levels 
should be measured 5 to 6 hours after dosing and should be checked frequently when initiating therapy 
(e.g. monthly) and every 3-4 months when on a stable dose. 
• 
• 
For children up to age 12 years, CYSTAGON dosing should be on the basis of body surface 
area (g/m2/day). The recommended dose is 1.30 g/m2/day of the free base divided four times 
daily.  
For patients over age 12 and over 50 kg weight, the recommended CYSTAGON dose is 
2 g/day, divided four times daily. 
Starting doses should be 1/4 to 1/6 of the expected maintenance dose, increased gradually over 4-
6 weeks to avoid intolerance. The dose should be raised if there is adequate tolerance and the 
leucocyte cystine level remains >1 nmol hemicystine/mg protein. The maximum dose of CYSTAGON 
used in clinical trials was 1.95 g/m2/day. 
The use of doses higher than 1.95 g/m2/day is not recommended (see section 4.4). 
Digestive tolerance of cysteamine is improved when the medicinal product is taken just after or with 
food. 
In children who are at risk of aspiration, aged approximately 6 years and under, the hard capsules 
should be opened and the content sprinkled on food. Experience suggests that foods such as milk, 
potatoes and other starch based products seem to be appropriate for mixing with the powder. However, 
acidic drinks, e.g. orange juice, should generally be avoided as the powder tends not to mix well and 
may precipitate out.

Patients on dialysis or post-transplantation: 
Experience has occasionally shown that some forms of cysteamine are less well tolerated (i.e. leading 
to more adverse events) when patients are on dialysis. A closer monitoring of the leucocyte cystine 
levels is recommended in these patients. 
Patients with hepatic insufficiency: 
Dose adjustment is not normally required; however, leucocyte cystine levels should be monitored. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients 
The use of CYSTAGON is contra-indicated during breast-feeding. CYSTAGON should not be used 
during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester, unless clearly necessary (see section 4.6 and 
section 5.3), as it is teratogenic in animals. 
CYSTAGON is contraindicated in patients who have developed hypersensitivity to penicillamine. 
4.4  Special warnings and special precautions for use 
CYSTAGON therapy must be initiated promptly after confirmation of the diagnosis of nephropathic 
cystinosis to achieve maximum benefit. 
Nephropathic cystinosis must have been diagnosed by both clinical signs and biochemical 
investigations (leucocyte cystine measurements). 
Cases of Ehlers-Danlos like syndrome and vascular disorders on elbows have been reported in 
children treated with high doses of different cysteamine preparations (cysteamine chlorhydrate or 
cystamine or cysteamine bitartrate) mostly above the maximal dose 1.95 g/m2/day. These skin lesions 
were associated with vascular proliferation, skin striae and bone lesions. 
It is therefore recommended to monitor regularly skin and to consider X-ray examinations of the bone 
as necessary. Self-examination of the skin by the patient or the parents should also be advised. If any 
similar skin or bone abnormalities appear, it is recommended to decrease the dose of CYSTAGON. 
The use of doses higher than 1.95g/m2/day is not recommended (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Monitoring of blood cell count is recommended on a regular basis. 
Oral cysteamine has not been shown to prevent eye deposition of cystine crystals. Therefore, where 
cysteamine ophthalmic solution is used for that purpose, its usage should continue. 
In contrast to phosphocysteamine, CYSTAGON does not contain phosphate. Most patients will 
already be receiving phosphate supplements and the dose of these may need to be altered when 
CYSTAGON is substituted for phosphocysteamine. 
Intact CYSTAGON hard capsules should not be administered to children under the age of 
approximately 6 years due to risk of aspiration (see section 4.2). 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed 
Interactions with other medicines have not been studied. CYSTAGON can be administered with 
electrolyte and mineral replacements necessary for management of the Fanconi syndrome as well as 
vitamin D and thyroid hormones. Indomethacin and CYSTAGON have been used simultaneously in 
some patients. In cases of patients with kidney transplants, anti-rejection treatments have been used 
with cysteamine.

4.6  Pregnancy and lactation 
There are no adequate data from the use of cysteamine bitartrate in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity, including teratogenesis (see section 5.3). The potential risk 
for humans is unknown. The effect on pregnancy of untreated cystinosis is also unknown. 
Therefore, CYSTAGON should not be used during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester, 
unless clearly necessary. 
If a pregnancy is diagnosed or planned, the treatment should be carefully reconsidered and the patient 
must be advised of the possible teratogenic risk of cysteamine. 
CYSTAGON excretion in human's milk is unknown. However, due to the results of animal studies in 
breast-feeding mothers and neonates (see section 5.3), breast-feeding is contra-indicated in women 
taking CYSTAGON.  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
CYSTAGON has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive ans use machines 
CYSTAGON may cause drowsiness. When starting therapy, patients should not engage in potentially 
hazardous activities until the effects of the medicinal product on each individual are known. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Approximately 35% of patients can be expected to experience adverse reactions. These mainly involve 
the gastrointestinal and central nervous systems. When these effects appear at the initiation of 
cysteamine therapy, temporary suspension and gradual reintroduction of treatment may be effective in 
improving tolerance. 
Reported adverse reactions are listed below, by system organ class and by frequency. Frequencies are 
defined as: very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥1/100 to 1/10) and uncommon (≥1/1,000 to 1/100). 
Within each frequency grouping, undesirable effects are presented in order of decreasing seriouness

Cases of nephrotic syndrome have been reported within 6 months of starting therapy with progressive 
recovery after treatment discontinuation. In some cases, histology showed a membranous 
glomerulonephritis of the renal allograft and hypersensitivity interstitial nephritis. 
Cases of Ehlers-Danlos like syndrome and vascular disorders on elbows have been reported in 
children chronically treated with high doses of different cysteamine preparations (cysteamine 
chlorhydrate or cystamine or cysteamine bitartrate) mostly above the maximal dose 1.95 g/m2/day. 
In some cases, these skin lesions were associated with vascular proliferation, skin striae and bone 
lesions first seen during an X-ray examination. Bone disorders reported were genu valgum, leg pain 
and hyperextensive joints, osteopenia, compression fractures, and scoliosis. 
In cases where histopathological examination of the skin was performed, the results suggested 
angioendotheliomatosis. 
One patient subsequently died of acute cerebral ischemia with marked vasculopathy.  
In some the patients, the skin lesions on elbows regressed after CYSTAGON dose reduction. 
Cysteamine mechanism of action by interfering with the cross-linking of collagen fibers has been 
postulated (see section 4.4). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
An overdose of cysteamine may cause progressive lethargy. 
Should overdosage occur, the respiratory and cardiovascular systems should be supported 
appropriately. No specific antidote is known. It is not known if cysteamine is removed by 
haemodialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Alimentary tract and metabolism product, ATC code: A16AA04.  
Normal individuals and heterozygous subjects for cystinosis have white cell cystine levels of < 0.2, 
and usually below 1 nmol hemicystine/mg protein, respectively. Individuals with nephropathic 
cystinosis have elevations of white cell cystine above 2 nmol hemicystine/mg protein 
Cysteamine reacts with cystine to form the mixed disulfide of cysteamine and cysteine. 
 The mixed disulfide is then exported from the lysosomes by an intact lysine transport system. The 
decrease in leucocyte cystine levels is correlated to the cysteamine plasma concentration over the six 
hours following the administration of CYSTAGON.  
The leucocyte cystine level reaches its minimum (mean ( sd) value: 1.8  0.8 hours) slightly later 
than the peak plasma cysteamine concentration (mean ( sd) value: 1.4  0.4 hours) and returns to its 
baseline level as the plasma cysteamine concentration decreases at 6 hours post-dose. 
In one clinical study, baseline white cell cystine levels were 3.73 (range 0.13 to 19.8) nmol 
hemicystine/mg protein and were maintained close to 1 nmol hemicystine/mg protein with a 
cysteamine dose range of 1.3 to 1.95 g/m2/day.  
An earlier study treated 94 children with nephropathic cystinosis with increasing doses of cysteamine 
to attain white cell cystine levels of less than 2 nmol hemicystine/mg protein 5 to 6 hours post-dose, 
and compared their outcome with an historical control group of 17 children treated with placebo. The 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
principal efficacy measurements were serum creatinine and calculated creatinine clearance and growth 
(height). The mean white cell cystine level attained during treatment was 1.7 + 0.2 nmol 
hemicystine/mg protein. Among cysteamine patients, glomerular function was maintained over time. 
Placebo treated patients, in contrast, experienced a gradual rise in serum creatinine. Patients on 
treatment maintained growth as compared to untreated patients. However, growth velocity did not 
increase enough to allow patients to catch up the normal for their age. Renal tubular function was not 
affected by treatment. Two other studies have shown similar results. 
In all studies, patient response was better when treatment was started at an early age with good renal 
function. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Following a single oral dose of cysteamine bitartrate equivalent to 1.05 g of cysteamine free base in 
healthy volunteers, the mean ( sd) values for the time to peak and peak plasma concentration are 1.4 
( 0.5) hours and 4.0 ( 1.0) µg/ml, respectively. In patients at steady state, these values are 1.4 ( 0.4) 
hours and 2.6 ( 0.9) µg/ml, respectively, after a dose ranging from 225 to 550 mg. 
Cysteamine bitartrate (CYSTAGON) is bioequivalent to cysteamine hydrochloride and 
phosphocysteamine. 
The in vitro plasma protein binding of cysteamine, which is mostly to albumin, is independent of 
plasma drug concentration over the therapeutic range, with a mean ( sd) value of 54.1 % ( 1.5). The 
plasma protein binding in patients at steady state is similar: 53.1 % ( 3.6) and 51.1 % ( 4.5) at 1.5 
and 6 hours post-dose, respectively. 
In a pharmacokinetic study performed in 24 healthy volunteers for 24 hours, the mean estimate ( sd) 
for the terminal half-life of elimination was 4.8 ( 1.8) hours. 
The elimination of unchanged cysteamine in the urine has been shown to range between 0.3 % and 
1.7% of the total daily dose in four patients; the bulk of cysteamine is excreted as sulphate. 
Very limited data suggest that cysteamine pharmacokinetic parameters may not be significantly 
modified in patients with mild to moderate renal insufficiency. No information is available for patients 
with severe renal insufficiency. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Genotoxicity studies have been performed: although in published studies using cysteamine, induction 
of chromosome aberrations in cultured eukaryotic cell lines has been reported, specific studies with 
cysteamine bitartrate did not show any mutagenic effects in the Ames test or any clastogenic effect in 
the mouse micronucleus test.  
Reproduction studies showed embryofoetotoxic effects (resorptions and post-implantation losses) in 
rats at the 100 mg/kg/day dose level and in rabbits receiving cysteamine 50 mg/kg/day. Teratogenic 
effects have been described in rats when cysteamine is administered over the period of organogenesis 
at a dose of 100 mg/kg/day.  
This is equivalent to 0.6 g/m2/day in the rat, which is less than half the recommended clinical 
maintenance dose of cysteamine, i.e. 1.30 g/ m2/day. A reduction of fertility was observed in rats at 
375 mg/kg/day, a dose at which body weight gain was retarded. At this dose, weight gain and survival 
of the offspring during lactation was also reduced. High doses of cysteamine impair the ability of 
lactating mothers to feed their pups. Single doses of the drug inhibit prolactin secretion in animals. 
Administration of cysteamine in neonate rats induced cataracts. 
High doses of cysteamine, either by oral or parenteral routes, produce duodenal ulcers in rats and mice 
but not in monkeys.  Experimental administration of the drug causes depletion of somatostatin in 
several animal species. The consequence of this for the clinical use of the drug is unknown.  
No carcinogenic studies have been conducted with CYSTAGON.

Further information 
1.  WHAT CYSTAGON IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
Cystinosis is a metabolic disease called ‘nephropathic cystinosis’ which is characterized by an 
abnormal accumulation of the amino acid cystine in various organs of the body such as the kidney, 
eye, muscle, pancreas, and brain. Cystine build up causes kidney damage and excretion of excess 
amounts of glucose, proteins and electrolytes. Different organs are affected at different ages. 
CYSTAGON is prescribed to manage this rare inherited disorder. CYSTAGON is a medicine that 
reacts with cystine to decrease its level within the cells.  
2. 
BEFORE YOU USE CYSTAGON 
Do not use CYSTAGON 
- 
if you -or your child- are allergic (hypersensitive) to cysteamine bitartrate or penicillamine or 
any of the other ingredients of Cystagon. 
If you are pregnant, this is particularly relevant during the first trimester 
if you are breast-feeding. 
Take special care with CYSTAGON 
- 
When your or your child’s disorder has been confirmed by leucocyte cystine measurements, the 
therapy with CYSTAGON must be started as soon as possible. 
A few cases of skin lesions on elbows like little hard lumps have been reported in children 
treated with high doses of different cysteamine preparations. These lesions were associated with 
skin striae and bone lesions such as fracture and bone deformities, and with laxity of joints. 
Your doctor could require a regular physical and X-ray examination for the skin and the bones 
to control the effects of the medicinal product. Self examination of your or your child’s skin is 
recommended. If any skin or bone abnormalities appear, please inform your doctor 
immediately. 
Your doctor could require controlling the blood cell count on a regular basis. 
CYSTAGON has not been shown to prevent cystine crystals accumulating in the eye. Where 
cysteamine ophthalmic solution has been used for that purpose, its usage should continue.

- 
- 
In contrast to phosphocysteamine, another active substance close to cysteamine bitartrate, 
CYSTAGON does not contain phosphate. You may already be receiving phosphate supplements 
and the dose of these may need to be changed when CYSTAGON is substituted for 
phosphocysteamine. 
To avoid any risk of aspiration in the lungs, the capsules should not be given to children under 
the age of approximately 6 years. 
Using other medicines 
Please inform your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, 
even those not prescribed. 
Using CYSTAGON with food and drink 
For children under approximately six years of age, the hard capsule may be opened and the contents 
sprinkled on food (e.g. milk, potatoes or starch based foods) or mixed in formula. Do not add to acidic 
drinks e.g. orange juice. Consult the doctor for complete directions. 
Pregnancy  
You should not use CYSTAGON if you are pregnant. Please consult your doctor if you plan to 
become pregnant. 
Breast-feeding 
CYSTAGON must not be used during breast-feeding. 
Driving and using machines  
CYSTAGON may cause some drowsiness. When starting therapy, you or your child should not 
engage in potentially hazardous activities until the effects of the drug are well known. 
3. 
HOW TO USE CYSTAGON 
Always use CYSTAGON exactly as your doctor or your  child’s doctor  has told you. You should 
check with your doctor if you are not sure. 
The dose of CYSTAGON prescribed for you or your child will depend on your or your child's age and 
weight.  
For children up to age 12 years, the dose will be based on the body size (surface area), the usual dose 
being 1.30 g/m2 of body surface area per day.  
For patients over age 12 and over 50 kg weight, the usual dose is 2g/day. 
In any case the usual dose should not exceed 1.95 g/m2/day. 
CYSTAGON should be taken or given only by mouth and exactly as your or your child's doctor 
directs. In order for CYSTAGON to work correctly, you must do the following: 
- 
Follow your doctor's directions exactly. Do not increase or decrease the amount of medicine 
without your doctor's approval. 
Hard capsules should not be given to children under approximately six years of age because 
they may not be able to swallow them and they may choke. For children under approximately 
six years of age, the hard capsule may be opened and the contents sprinkled on food (e.g. milk, 
potatoes or starch based foods) or mixed in formula. Do not add to acidic drinks e.g. orange 
juice. Consult the doctor for complete directions. 
Your or your child's medical treatment may include, in addition to CYSTAGON, one or more 
supplements to replace important electrolytes lost through the kidneys. It is important to take or 
give these supplements exactly as instructed. If several doses of the supplements are missed or 
weakness or drowsiness develops, call the doctor for instructions. 
Regular blood tests to measure the amount of cystine inside white blood cells are necessary to 
help determine the correct dose of CYSTAGON. Your or your child's doctor will arrange for the 
blood tests to be done. Regular blood and urine tests to measure the levels of the body's 
important electrolytes are also necessary to help your or your child's doctor correctly adjust the 
doses of these supplements. 
- 
- 
- 
30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CYSTAGON should be taken 4 times a day, every 6 hours, preferably just after or with food. It is 
important to take the dose as close to every 6 hours as possible. 
Treatment with CYSTAGON should continue indefinitely, as instructed by your doctor. 
If you use more CYSTAGON than you should: 
You should contact your or your child's doctor or the hospital emergency department immediately if 
more medicine has been taken than has been prescribed, drowsiness develops . 
If you forget to take CYSTAGON: 
If a dose of medicine is missed, it should be taken as soon as possible. However if it is within two 
hours of the next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to the regular dosing schedule. Do not take a 
double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
4. 
POSSIBLE SIDE EFFECTS 
Like all medicines, CYSTAGON can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
CYSTAGON may cause some people to become drowsy or less vigilant than they are normally. Make 
sure you know how you or your child reacts to this medicine before doing anything that could be 
dangerous if not alert. 
The following side effects were reported as follows: very common (occurring in at least one in 10 
patients), common (occurring in at least one in 100 patients), uncommon (occurring in at least one

FURTHER INFORMATION 
What CYSTAGON contains

1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are 
issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD 
is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Update of Section 4.4 of the SmPC for four GSK 
meningococcal vaccines to include a safety warning of 
the risk for invasive disease caused by Neisseria 
meningitidis relative to individuals with familial 
complement deficiencies and individuals receiving 
treatment that inhibits terminal complement 
activation (for example eculizumab). 
The Package Leaflets (PL) are updated accordingly. In 
addition, the Worksharing Applicant (WSA) took the 
opportunity to amend the list of local representatives 
from the MAH’s safety database, the Bexsero /Menveo SmPC 
has been updated to reflect that persons with familial 
complement deficiencies (for example, C5 or C3 deficiencies) 
and persons receiving treatments that inhibit terminal 
complement activation (for example, eculizumab) are at 
increased risk for invasive disease caused by Neisseria 
meningitidis (of the group relevant for each vaccine), even if 
they develop antibodies following vaccination with Bexsero 
(/Menveo, as applicable). 
The PLs have been updated accordingly.

in US, immunogenicity of a 2-dose series and a single dose of 
Menveo was compared in children 2 through 5 and 6 through 
10 years of age (N=715). 
At baseline, the percentage of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 
across the two age strata was 1%-5% for serogroup A, 
13%-28% for serogroup C, 42%-64% for serogroup W135, 
and 6%-19% for serogroup Y. At 1 month post last 
vaccination, the percentages of subjects with hSBA ≥1:8 in 
the 2-dose group and in the single dose group across the two 
age strata were: 90%-95% vs 76%–80% for serogroup A, 
98%-99% vs 76%-87% for serogroup C, 99% vs 93%-96% 
for serogroup W135, and 96% vs 65%-69% for serogroup Y. 
GMTs were higher in the 2-dose group than the single dose 
group at 1 month after vaccination in both age strata; 
however, this difference was less pronounced in the older 
age stratum. 
At 1 year post last vaccination, the percentages of subjects 
with hSBA ≥1:8 after the 2-dose series and the single dose 
were both lower than at 1 month post-vaccination (30% after 
the 2-dose series, 11%-20% after the single dose for 
serogroup A; 61%-81% and 41%-55% for serogroup C; 
92%-94% and 90%-91% for serogroup W135; 67%-75% 
and 57%-65% for serogroup Y). The differences between 
hSBA GMTs in the 2-dose and the single dose groups at 1 
year after vaccination were lower than those seen at 1 month 
post-vaccination. 
The clinical benefit of a 2-dose vaccination series in children 
2 through 10 years of age is not known.

22% of subjects 2-5 and 6-10 years of age, respectively, had 
hSBA ≥ 1:8 (GMTs 2.95 and 3.73). 
The children also received a booster dose of Menveo, 5 years 
after a single dose primary vaccination. All subjects in both 
age groups had hSBA ≥ 1:8 across all serogroups, with 
antibody titers several fold higher than seen after the

Menveo continues to be adequately and sufficiently 
demonstrated and therefore considers that the benefit/risk 
profile of Menveo continues to be favourable. The CHMP 
concluded that henceforth the MAH should   submit the PSUR

previously assessed V59P13 and V59P18 studies, which 
rendered a subset of immunogenicity results invalid. As a 
result of the same transcription error three assays were 
repeated. The MAH provided statistical sensitivity analyses to 
determine the impact of this invalidation upon the 
conclusions of both studies and updated the pivotal results 
for V59P13 and V59P18 to account for these data. Based on 
the analysis performed by the MAH, the CHMP concluded the 
differences as compared to the original data are small and 
the main conclusions remain unaffected by these corrections. 
Section 5.1 of the SmPC has been revised to correct the 
results for the PP population from study V59P13. 1396 
(instead of 1483) subjects between 11 and 18 years old and 
902 (instead of 961) subjects between 19 and 55 years who 
received MenACWY are now included in the per protocol (PP) 
population of study V59P13. There was no impact on the 
SmPC in relation to study V59P18.

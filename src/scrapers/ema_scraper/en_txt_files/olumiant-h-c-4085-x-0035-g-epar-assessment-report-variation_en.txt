2.  Scientific discussion
2.1.  Problem statement
2.1.1.  Disease or condition
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a heterogeneous group of diseases characterised by arthritis of 
unknown origin with onset before age of 16 years, persisting for more than 6 weeks. The currently 
used International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) classification distinguishes the 
following JIA categories: systemic arthritis, polyarthritis rheumatoid factor (RF) negative, polyarthritis 
RF positive, oligoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, enthesitis-related and undifferentiated arthritis. 
According to the Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of JIA, 
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), axial spondyloarthritis, and PsA are diseases in adults that correspond most 
closely to individual categories of JIA with similar clinical manifestations and underlying immunologic 
mechanisms, i.e. polyarticular JIA, Enthesitis related arthritis (ERA) and JIA-PsA, respectively 
(EMA/CHMP/239770/2014 Rev. 2). The proposed new indication for baricitinib is: ‘for the treatment of 
active juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients 2 years of age and older who have had an inadequate 
response or intolerance to one or more prior conventional synthetic or biologic disease-modifying 
antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs):
- Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular rheumatoid factor positive [RF+] or negative 
[RF-], extended oligoarticular),
- Enthesitis related arthritis, and
- Juvenile psoriatic arthritis.
Systemic JIA is discriminated from other forms of JIA, and it is not included in this submission. For 
systemic JIA a separate study (JAHU) is ongoing, which is included in the paediatric investigation plan 
(PIP).
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Estimations of the epidemiology of JIA are limited by its low frequency and difficulties in diagnosis and 
classification. According to a systematic review, incidence rates of JIA varied from 1,6 to 23/100.000 
and prevalence varied from 3,8 to 400/100.000 in Europe (Thierry et al. 2014). Oligoarthritis was the 
most frequent form. Incidence and prevalence are estimated to be higher for girls than for boys 
(Thierry et al. 2014; Cardoso et al. 2021). In Europe, the number of incident cases with JIA is 
estimated to be ~60.000 in 2010 and ~64.000 in 2017 (Thierry et al. 2014; Dave et al. 2020).
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis
The aetiology and pathogenesis of JIA are still poorly understood. As with many auto-immune and 
inflammatory diseases, it is hypothesised that a genetically susceptible individual could develop an 
immune response towards a self-antigen on exposure to an unknown environmental trigger, which 
generates a self-perpetuating loop of activation of both innate and adaptive immunity that causes 
tissue inflammation and damage (Ravelli 2016). 
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 10/110
JIA shares several immunological abnormalities identified in RA (Ravelli and Martini 2007). The 
inflammatory synovitis in JIA is similar to that observed in RA. The synovium in JIA shows pronounced 
hyperplasia of the lining layer and infiltration of the sublining layer with mononuclear cells, including T 
cells, B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells, and plasma cells, as similarly observed in RA. Levels of 
inflammatory cytokines elevated in adult patients with RA, such as IL-1β, IL-6, and TNFα, are also 
elevated in the synovial fluid and serum of patients with JIA; these cytokines also correlate with 
markers of disease activity such as CRP and ESR (Lepore et al. 1994; Mangge et al. 1995; Rooney et 
al. 1995, 2000; De Benedetti et al. 1997).
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis
Depending on the number of joints affected, the presence of extra-articular manifestations, systemic 
symptoms, serology and genetic factors, JIA is divided into oligoarticular, polyarticular, systemic, 
psoriatic, enthesitis-related and undifferentiated arthritis (Zaripova 2021).
Oligoarticular JIA is characterised by inflammation of up to four joints that usually proceeds as 
asymmetrical arthritis of the joints of the lower extremities, such as knee and ankle, with a high 
frequency of positivity to anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) and high risk of chronic uveitis (Zaripova 2012). 
Oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis is further divided into persistent oligoarthritis, in which there 
is no additional joint involvement after the first six months of illness, and extended oligoarthritis, in 
which there is involvement of additional joints after the first six months (Up-to-date). 
Polyarticular JIA affects five or more large/ small joints and is hallmarked by injury to the 
metacarpophalangeal joints and wrists (Zaripova 2021; Ravelli 2016). RF-negative polyarticular JIA 
tends to asymmetrical patterns of joint inflammation, while the RF-positive variant tends to symmetric 
involvement of the large and small joints of hands and feet (Zaripova 2021; Ravelli 2016). 
Enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) resembles oligoarthritis, affecting the joints of the lower limb in 
association with enthesitis (Zaripova 2012). The involvement of lower limb joints, sacroiliac joints, 
enthesitis, uveitis and the association with HLAB27, suggest similarities to spondylarthropathies 
(Ravelli 2016). 
Juvenile psoriatic arthritis in itself is heterogeneous, often proceeding as oligoarthritis or RF-negative 
polyarthritis and involves more commonly the small joints accompanied by dactylitis, psoriatic rash 
and/ or nail pitting (Zaripova 2012).
JIA is a major cause of disability in children (EMA/CHMP/239770/2014 Rev. 2). Long-term 
complications resulting from longstanding inflammation and glucocorticoid therapy can include joint 
erosions, and deformities, growth retardation with reduced final adult height, body composition 
changes with reduced bone and muscle mass, metabolic complications, and osteoporosis. These 
physical complications, as well as the ongoing disease itself, can impair educational, social and 
emotional development, thereby highlighting the need for early effective treatment. In addition, 
specific types of JIA may be accompanied by chronic anterior iridocyclitis/uveitis. The prognosis in 
general, depends on the clinical category of JIA, the severity, the rapidity of diagnosis, appropriate 
referral, initiation of optimal therapy and response to treatment.
2.1.5.  Management
The aim of treatment of JIA is rapid suppression of inflammation in order to prevent joint damage, 
prevent the occurrence of flares, maximise physical function and promote normal growth and

Page 11/110
development. The ultimate treatment goal is the induction of clinical remission or the attainment of 
minimal disease activity or inactive disease.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are considered a first–line treatment option in most 
cases of newly diagnosed JIA, followed by intra-articular glucocorticosteroids and conventional disease 
modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) including methotrexate and sulfasalazine. However, a 
substantial proportion of patients do not achieve an adequate response to these therapies (Ringold et 
al. 2013; Hinze et al. 2015; Ravelli 2016). Biologic agents approved for RA in the last decades have 
been added to the treatments available to children with JIA (Lovell et al. 2000; Ruperto et al. 2010b; 
Brunner et al. 2015). Although these biological treatments have led to clinical improvements, many 
patients do not respond and do not achieve long-lasting remission (Hinze et al. 2015; Onel et al. 
2022). These treatments include TNF-inhibitors (adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab), tocilizumab, 
secukinumab, and abatacept. The only Janus kinase (JAK)-inhibitor approved for JIA up to now is 
tofacitinib. 
Etanercept and adalimumab are TNF-blocking agents that have similar mechanisms of action. 
Adalimumab is approved for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients 
≥2 years of age and for ERA in patients ≥6 years of age (Humira SmPC). Etanercept is approved for 
the treatment of polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in 
children ≥2 years and for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis and of ERA in adolescents ≥12 years 
(Enbrel SmPC). Abatacept inhibits T cell production and is approved for the treatment of polyarticular 
JIA in patients of ≥6 years of age (Orencia SmPC). Tocilizumab is an anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal 
antibody that is approved for children ≥2 years of age with polyarticular JIA (rheumatoid factor 
positive or negative) or extended oligoarthritis (Roactemra SmPC). Secukinumab is approved for 
children ≥6 years with ERA or with jPsA (Cosentyx SmPC). Tofacitinib (a JAK inhibitor) was approved in 
the EU in 2021 for the treatment of polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative), extended 
oligoarthritis, and the treatment of psoriatic arthritis, in children ≥2 years (Xeljanz SmPC).
2.2.  About the product
Baricitinib belongs to the pharmacological class of JAK inhibitors. JAKs are a family of 4 protein 
tyrosine kinases (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and TYK2) that play an important role in cytokine signal 
transduction. JAKs are enzymes that transduce intracellular signals from cell surface receptors for a 
number of cytokines and growth factors involved in haematopoiesis, inflammation, and immune 
function (O’Shea et al. 2015). Baricitinib is a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor demonstrating selectivity for and 
inhibition of JAK1 and JAK2 with lower potency towards inhibition of JAK3 or TYK2 (Fridman et al. 
2010). Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, selective immunosuppressants, ATC code: 
L04AA37
Inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, which transduces cell signalling through the JAK/STAT pathway 
(Rawlings et al. 2004), and TNF, whose expression is reduced by inhibition of JAK1 and JAK2, are 
considered to be associated with the pathology of JIA (Ravelli and Martini 2007). Inhibition of JAK-
STAT signalling by baricitinib can target multiple JIA-associated cytokine pathways and may provide 
novel therapeutic approaches to disease management.
Baricitinib is already approved in the treatment for moderate to severe RA, for moderate to severe 
atopic dermatitis (AD) and for severe alopecia areata (AA) in adult patients.
The proposed new indication for baricitinib is: ‘for the treatment of active juvenile idiopathic arthritis in 
patients 2 years of age and older who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more 
prior conventional synthetic or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs):
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 12/110
- Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular rheumatoid factor positive [RF+] or negative 
[RF-], extended oligoarticular),
- Enthesitis related arthritis, and
- Juvenile psoriatic arthritis.
Baricitinib may be used as monotherapy or in combination with conventional synthetic DMARDs.
The subcategories of JIA in the proposed indication follow the ILAR categories, which is in line with the 
EMA Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis (EMA/CHMP/239770/2014 Rev. 2). For the treatment of JIA, the proposed dose of baricitinib is 
4 mg once daily for patients weighing 30 kg or greater. For patients weighing less than 30 kg, the 
recommended dose is 2 mg once daily. The dose is reduced by half for patients using strong Organic 
Anion Transporter 3 (OAT3) inhibitors or with a creatinine clearance between 30 and 60 mL/min.
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development
The baricitinib clinical development programme for JIA includes one pivotal Phase 3 study (IV-MC-
JAHV) and 1 supportive long-term extension study (IV MC JAHX); the long-term extension study is still 
ongoing. Dosing for JIA was based on PK/PD modelling of data in RA; the intended doses of 4 mg and 
2 mg that were based on body weight, were tested in the PK phase of the pivotal study JAHV. As half 
doses may be needed for patients with decreased renal function or using strong OAT3 inhibitors, the 
Applicant has submitted a new 1 mg tablet as a line extension in this application. 
Systemic JIA is not included in this dossier; a separate study (JAHU) is included in the PIP. The agreed 
PIP requires the applicant to develop an age-appropriate liquid oral formulation. The applicant 
developed and investigated an oral suspension formulation during the study JAHV. However, the oral 
suspension is not included in this dossier. The applicant provided comparison of in vitro dissolution 
profiles and PK data that supports the bioequivalence between the 2 mg/mL oral suspension 
formulation and the 4 mg commercial tablet.
The Applicant has not applied for CHMP Scientific Advice. The pivotal study has been performed in 
basic agreement with the EMA Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the 
treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (EMA/CHMP/239770/2014 Rev. 2). This includes the inclusion 
of different subclasses of JIA (polyarticular JIA, extended oligoarticular JIA, ERA, juvenile PsA), with a 
lower age range of 2 years and having moderate to severe active disease, a staggered PK study over 
age ranges, the use of time-to-flare as the primary outcome in the randomised withdrawal phase, 
response criteria and low disease states as secondary outcomes, a long term study to confirm 
effectiveness and safety. The submitted article 46 paediatric study I4V-MC-JAHV 
(EMEA/C/004085/46/013) is combined with this extension application.
2.4.  Quality aspects
2.4.1.  Introduction
This line extension concerns the addition of this new strength to the previously approved strengths of 2 
mg & 4 mg film-coated tablets. The extension is also linked to the addition of a new indication for 
paediatric patients applicable to all strengths.   
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 13/110
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 1 mg of baricitinib as active 
substance. 
Other ingredients are: 
Tablet core: mannitol, microcrystalline cellulose, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate. 
Film-coating mixture: poly (vinyl alcohol), titanium dioxide (E171), macrogol, talc, lecithin (soya) 
(E322) and iron oxide red (E172).
The product is available in polyvinylchloride/polyethylene/polychlorotrifluoroethylene - aluminium 
blisters and polyvinylchloride/aluminium/oriented polyamide - aluminium perforated unit dose blisters 
as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance
The active substance documentation is identical to that previously approved for the authorised 
strengths and is acceptable. No new information has been provided.
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development
The proposed 1 mg strength is a very light pink 6.75 mm round film-coated immediate-release tablet 
debossed with “Lilly” on one side and “1” on the other. It is distinguished from the currently authorized 
strengths of 2 mg and 4 mg by means of different shape, dimension, inscriptions and colour. 1
The development of the 1 mg strength was based on the work conducted for the approved 2 mg and 4 
mg strengths. The 1 mg strength is based on a common blend approach with the 2 mg strength and a 
slightly different quantitative composition of the coating to achieve a different colour. The same 
manufacturing process is used as for the already authorised strengths. On this basis, no additional 
formulation development work has been done for the new proposed strength.
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with relevant 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report.
The application also included a new indication for use in paediatric patient populations, and the 
applicant suitably discussed and justified the excipients in the intended paediatric population. In the 
clinical studies in children the swallowability of the tablets has been evaluated and the results are 
presented. Most children from 6 years of age had no problem swallowing the tablets. It is also 
proposed that the tablets could be dispersed for patients who have difficulty swallowing the tablet 
formulation. The palatability of the dispersed tablets has been adequately discussed and is accepted. 
Information surrounding the dispersion of the tablets has been included in the product information.
The applicant has also developed an oral suspension formulation, in line with the PIP requirements, 
although this suspension formulation has not yet been submitted for authorisation. The oral suspension 
formulation was used in paediatric clinical trials. In order to justify the applicability of the clinical 
results obtained with the suspension to the tablets, a bioequivalence study has been performed 
demonstrating bioequivalence of the suspension with the 4 mg tablets. Please refer to the clinical 
section for detailed information.

The equivalence of kinetics between the 4 mg and 2 mg tablets was already demonstrated in vivo in 
the original dossier. The 2 mg and 1 mg tablets are based on a common blend approach, and in order 
to bridge the results to the 1 mg strength, comparative dissolution profiles were generated between 
the 2 mg and 1 mg strengths. However the dissolution profile comparisons originally presented were 
not in line the Guideline on Investigation of Bioequivalence, as a pH of 5 was used for comparison 
rather than pH 4.5 for one of the dissolution profile comparisons. As no adequate justification was 
provided for deviation from the guideline requirements a joint Quality/Pharmacokinetic major objection 
was raised during the procedure. To resolve this, the applicant presented as requested further 
comparisons at pH 4.5 and the biowaiver was considered acceptable. The administration proposal for 
the tablets also included the preparation of dispersions for patients unable or unwilling to swallow 
whole tablets. A major objection was raised on the need to justify and outline the impact of the tablet 
dispersion on patient exposure to the active substance. The applicant provided sufficient justification 
regarding the BCS class III nature of the active substance and in vitro dissolution comparisons. On this 
basis it was accepted that equivalence between whole or dispersed tablets was sufficiently 
demonstrated. 
No discussion was provided about developing the QC method for dissolution and establishing the 
regular QC limit for this parameter, as the same method and limits will be used for the currently 
approved strengths this is acceptable. 
The primary packaging is polyvinylchloride/polyethylene/polychlorotrifluoroethylene - aluminium 
blisters and polyvinylchloride/aluminium/oriented polyamide - aluminium perforated unit dose blisters. 
The packaging materials proposed for the 1 mg tablets are common for this pharmaceutical form and 
are the same as in use for the currently approved strengths. No new information about microbiological 
attributes and compatibility has been provided, which is acceptable. The choice of the container closure 
system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls
The manufacturing process consists of seven main steps: pre-blending step 1, pre-blending step 2, 
roller compaction and dry sizing, final blending, tablet compression, film-coating and packaging. The 
process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process due to the low active substance 
content in the finished product. The manufacturing process for the 1 mg strength is in line with the 
process for the 2 mg and 4 mg strengths and is conducted at the same site of manufacture. 
1Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. Information 
has been provided on the validation of three commercial scale batches of the 1 mg strength. It has 
been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of 
dosage form; identity (IR), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), description (visual), uniformity 
of dosage units (HPLC), dissolution (HPLC), dye identity (chemical reaction).
2The specifications for the 1 mg strength have been set in line with the approved 2 mg and 4 mg 
strengths. The specifications have been adequately justified, and appropriate limits for degradation 
products have been set in line with ICH Q3B. As no degradation impurities were detected above the ID 
threshold no impurities are specified in the specifications. 
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 15/110
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data 
on batches of the blend common to the 1 mg and 2 mg strengths tested using a ICP-MS method was 
provided, demonstrating that each relevant elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the 
respective PDE. Based on this it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental 
impurity controls.
No risk evaluation on nitrosamines specific for the new proposed strength has been provided, only a 
summary of the risk evaluation performed for the other strengths. As the new proposed strength has 
the same components, manufacturing process and packaging material as the already approved 
strengths, no question is raised as it is considered that the 1 mg strength is covered by the risk 
evaluation already performed for the approved higher strengths.
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for 
assay and impurity testing has been presented.
Batch analysis results are provided for 12 batches, including 3 at the proposed commercial batch size 
which confirm the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the 
intended product specification. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of finished product in each of the proposed commercial 
container closure systems and stored for up to 36 months under long term conditions (30 ºC / 60% 
RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are representative of those proposed for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. 
Samples were tested for identity, assay, degradation products, description, and dissolution. Water 
activity and microbiological quality were also tested during the stability studies using validated in-
house methods. A bracketing approach was applied to some of the testing time-points and parameters. 
This was applied at time points 3, 6, 9 and 12 months at long term conditions and at time points 1 and 
3 months at accelerated conditions. Complete testing of all parameters was applied at initial, 18, 24 
and 36 months at long term conditions and at 6 months at accelerated conditions.
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. The results of the stability studies remained 
within the defined specifications with the exception of one result for assay. A single low value out of 
specification result was observed at one six month time-point during long term testing, this result was 
seen to be atypical and potentially attributable to analytical variability, subsequent testing of the same 
batch at later time points showed the assay value returned back within specification. No downward or 
decreasing trend is seen in the long-term assay results, a slight downward trend is seen at the 
accelerated conditions.   
In addition, 1 batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. The finished product is not sensitive to light. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months without special storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable.

2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used.
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects
There are no changes to the active substance. Information on development, manufacture and control 
of the finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out 
indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead 
to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
The CHMP originally raised two multi-disciplinary major objections impacting Quality, the first 
regarding the in-vitro dissolution testing needed to bridge the pharmacokinetic data relevant for the 2 
mg strength to the proposed 1 mg strength, as originally the dissolution profile comparisons used to 
support the requested biowaiver of strengths were not conducted in line with the guideline on the 
investigation of bioequivalence. This was resolved by the provision of the requested data comparisons 
at pH 4.5 in line with the requirements of the guideline.
The second multi-disciplinary major objection concerned the need to bridge or justify that the exposure 
to the dispersed tablets would be similar to those of the studied whole tablets. The applicant provided 
suitable justification to resolve the objection, this was based on the highly soluble BCS class III nature 
of the active substance and the in-vitro dissolution profile comparisons. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development
Not applicable.
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects
2.5.1.  Introduction
No new non-clinical studies have been conducted to support the extension of indication or the line 
extension of Olumiant (baricitinib) for a new strength of 1 mg tablets. The non-clinical overview 
summarises the relevant non-clinical data to support the administration of baricitinib to paediatric 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients aged 2 and above and was based on a juvenile animal study in 
rats. The juvenile rat study was performed to support a paediatric indication for atopic dermatitis. The 
data from this study has been briefly outlined in this report.
2.5.2.  Pharmacology
Baricitinib is a small molecule, selective inhibitor of the Janus kinase (JAK) family of protein tyrosine 
kinases with potency and selectivity for JAK2 and JAK1, and less potency for JAK3, or Tyrosine kinase 
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 17/110
2 (TYK2) (Fridman et al. 2010). Members of the JAK family of protein tyrosine kinases (JAK1, JAK2, 
JAK3, and TYK2) play an important role in signal transduction following cytokine and growth factor 
binding to their receptors. Aberrant production of cytokines and growth factors has been associated 
with a number of chronic inflammatory conditions, including JIA.
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics
No pharmacokinetic studies were conducted for this line extension.
2.5.4.  Toxicology
A juvenile rat study (9000909) was completed in 2017 to support the dosing of baricitinib to patients 1 
to <12 years old (assessed in EMEA/H/C/004085/II/0016 and EMEA/H/C/004085/R/0025). 
Administration of baricitinib to rats by once daily oral gavage at 0, 1, 5, or 25 mg/kg/day from 
postnatal day (PND) 10 to 90, resulted in changes most notable concerning overall growth, the 
immune system, and bone. Reductions in overall growth were evidenced by lower body weight and 
lower body weight gain relative to concurrent controls. With regard to the immune system, decreases 
in peripheral and tissue lymphocyte counts reduced lymphoid organ weights and decreased lymphoid 
cellularity in the thymus, spleen, and lymph node were associated with a decrease in the T-cell-
dependent antibody response. The immune effects were expected based on the pharmacology of 
baricitinib. Similar effects on growth (body weight) and the immune system were also observed in the 
6-month repeat-dose rat toxicology study in older animals (Study T08-04-05). Bone effects observed 
in the juvenile rat study included:
•
•
•
•
degeneration/atrophy of the femoral head and neck (increased incidence over background)
a single animal with osteomyelitis and secondary fracture
slight decrease in bone length and mass, and
accelerated maturation of secondary ossification centres with normal growth plates
No visible baricitinib-related skeletal effects were observed in previous repeat-dose toxicology studies 
in rats or dogs, which included near-lifetime exposure in the longest-duration studies. There was no 
evidence of bone fractures or changes in bone structure based on the lack of clinical signs and affirmed 
by bone histology. Rats and dogs used in these studies were approximately 8 weeks old and 5 to 6 
months old, respectively, at the initiation of dosing. These ages cover the development of major organ 
systems, including skeletal, during the adolescent period in humans. However, the majority of the 
findings identified in the juvenile study were from anatomic regions or endpoints that were not 
included in the repeat-dose rat and dog studies; thus, direct comparisons to the effects observed in the 
juvenile study are not possible. Effects on the skeleton were also observed in the rat and rabbit 
embryo-fetal development (EFD) studies and rat pre-and postnatal development (PPND) study. Bent 
long bones and ribs observed in the EFD and PPND studies reflect developmental delays or variations 
and were shown to be transient and reversible. Such developmental delays or variations are not 
considered permanent changes resulting in clinically significant effects. All of the bone effects observed 
in the PPND and juvenile studies were considered to be manageable and/or not clinically relevant. The 
effects were either considered non-adverse, reversible or occurred at large exposure multiple to clinical 
exposures. However, clinical effects in the long term cannot be fully excluded because the duration of 
treatment in the pre-clinical studies is limited.
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 18/110
Additional safety measures were implemented in all of the ongoing and planned paediatric studies with 
baricitinib to monitor this potential risk of growth and bone effects in the long term based on the rat 
juvenile study.
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment
An updated environmental risk assessment has been provided that considers environmental exposure 
due to both the already registered (RA, AD and AA) and proposed (JIA) indications. The environmental 
data previously submitted with the initial dossier serves as the basis for the updated environmental 
risk assessment. 
Physical-chemical properties and fate characteristics indicate that baricitinib will not persist in the 
aqueous environmental compartment since it undergoes some removal by binding to sludge biosolids 
during sewage treatment and by partitioning to sediment once in the water column. The concentration 
of baricitinib in sediment would be very low. Baricitinib is subject to some removal from the sediment 
compartment through biodegradation and irreversible binding to sediment particles. The rate of 
removal is slow and there is some potential for persistence of low concentrations in aquatic sediment. 
Using assumptions of no metabolism, no removal during sewage treatment, and 1% of the European 
population taking the maximum dose for each indication, the maximum predicted environmental 
concentration of total baricitinib residue in surface water is 0.08 μg/L and in sediment is 304 μg/kg 
(dry weight).
Studies to evaluate both acute and chronic effects on environmental species have been conducted with 
baricitinib. Fish were the most sensitive species tested. The predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) 
of baricitinib for surface water, groundwater, and sewage microorganisms were 60, 210, and 100000 
μg/L, respectively. The PNEC for sediment was 27150 μg/kg. The predicted environmental 
concentrations of total residues of baricitinib are significantly lower than the PNEC values. Therefore, 
excretion by humans of baricitinib and its metabolites is not expected to result in a significant 
environmental risk. Additionally, baricitinib is not expected to bioaccumulate in aquatic organisms 
based on a log Kow less than 4.5. Therefore, baricitinib is not classified as a PBT or a vPvB molecule.
The initial estimate of the PEC surface water is based on the maximum recommended daily dose of the 
active ingredient, a default market penetration of 1% of the total population, 200 L of wastewater 
discharge per capita, and an average dilution factor of 10 for discharge into surface water. For drug 
substances used for multiple indications, the PECs for each indication are summed. PEC surface water 
calculated for each indication of baricitinib is 0.02 μg/L and the total PEC surface water. Thus, with this 
indication, the PEC surface water increases from 0.06μg/L to 0.08 μg/L for the four indications.
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects
No new non-clinical studies were submitted which was considered acceptable to the CHMP.
The juvenile rat study completed in 2017 supports an assessment of safety in children aged 1 and up 
(assessed in EMEA/H/C/004085/II/0016 and EMEA/H/C/004085/R/0025). While data from studies in 
adult animals did not identify bone as a target organ, the bone findings from the juvenile toxicity study 
in rats and reproductive toxicity studies in rabbits and rats suggest that skeletal concerns were only 
noted at exposures that are not clinically relevant. However, clinical effects in the long term cannot be 
fully excluded because the duration of treatment in the pre-clinical studies is limited. Therefore, the 
inclusion of “Long-term safety in pediatric patients including growth and bone development, 
maturation and pubertal development” as missing information in the list of safety concerns of the RMP 
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 19/110
is agreed. The protocol of Study I4V-MC-JAHX was updated to include the assessment of maturation 
and pubertal development.
Physical-chemical properties and fate characteristics indicate that baricitinib could be present in surface 
water and sediment at low concentrations and be subject to slow removal by biodegradation and 
irreversible binding to sediments. Based on the slow removal rate, baricitinib has the potential to 
persist in the aquatic sediment, but the concentrations would be very low.
The predicted no-effect concentrations (PNECs) of baricitinib for organisms associated with surface 
water, ground water, and for microorganisms are 60, 210, and 100000 μg/L, respectively. The PNEC of 
baricitinib for sediment-dwelling organisms is 27150 μg/kg. The aqueous predicted environmental 
concentrations of total baricitinib residues are more than two orders of magnitude lower than these 
PNEC values. Therefore, excretion by humans of baricitinib and its metabolites is not expected to result 
in a significant environmental risk. Additionally, baricitinib is not expected to bioaccumulate in aquatic 
organisms based on a log Kow less than 4.5. Therefore, baricitinib is not classified as a PBT or a vPvB 
molecule and is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects
The non-clinical aspects of baricitinib were thoroughly evaluated during the initial marketing 
authorisation procedure. No new non-clinical studies were submitted in support of the present 
application which was considered acceptable to the CHMP.
Section 5.3 “Preclinical safety data” of the SmPC is considered up to date.
The conclusion by the MAH that excretion by humans of baricitinib and its metabolites is not expected 
to result in a significant environmental risk is endorsed.
2.6.  Clinical aspects

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics
Bioequivalence
The Applicant is requesting a line extension for a 1 mg tablet strength and submitted information on 
the bioequivalence of an oral suspension formulation (2 mg/mL) (oral suspension was used to dose 
some of the paediatric patients in study JAHV) versus the tablet to support paediatric dosing (study 
JAGU). A 1 mg tablet strength was developed using a common blend with the approved 2 mg tablet. 
The 1 mg strengths is thus qualitatively and quantitatively similar to the 2 mg tablet. In addition, the 
dissolution profiles for the 1 mg tablet are comparable to the 2 mg tablet profiles across the pH range. 
The in vitro dissolution of baricitinib was determined at 3 pHs (pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8) in 900 mL fluid at 
37°C and at 50 rpm in a paddle apparatus according to the Guideline on Investigation of 
Bioequivalence.
A clinical study was performed to investigate if the developed commercial 2 mg/mL oral suspension 
formulation was bioequivalent to the 4 mg commercial tablet (study JAGU Part A). 
Study JAGU Part A is a 3-period, randomized, crossover design in 24 subjects per group to evaluate 
the bioequivalence of 4 mg baricitinib administered as a single dose of suspension formulation, with 
and without water, and 4 mg baricitinib administered as a 4 mg tablet with water. Subjects had a 
mean age of 39.9 ± 8.5 years (23-59 years), a mean body weight of 68.8 ± 9.3 kg (48.0-86.7 kg), 
and a mean BMI of 24.2 ± 2.6 kg/m2 (20.1-29.9 kg/m2). Plasma were collected at the following times: 
pre-dose, and 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 24, 36, and 48 hours post-dose. Non-
compartmental analysis was used to calculate the PK parameters. Furthermore, log-transformed Cmax, 
AUC0-last, and AUC0-inf estimates were evaluated in a linear mixed effects model with fixed effects for 
formulation, period, sequence, and a random effect for subject (sequence). Bioequivalence between 
the suspension formulation administered either with or without water and the commercial tablet was 
concluded if the 95% CI for Cmax, AUC0-last, and AUC0-inf were all completely contained within the 
interval (0.80, 1.25). The PK parameters are summarised in Panel 2.

A clinical study was performed to investigate the food effect on the oral suspension formulation (study 
JAGU Part B). Study JAGU Part B is a 2-period, randomized, crossover design to determine the effect of 
a high-fat, high-calorie meal on the PK of 4 mg baricitinib administered as a single dose of the 
suspension formulation without water. Subjects were dosed according to their treatment sequence on 
Day 1 following an overnight fast of 10 hours; with the exception of 1 period for subjects in Part B, 
where a high-fat, high-calorie meal was started 30 minutes pre-dose, with the intention that the meal 
be ingested in its entirety over an approximate 25 minute period. A high-fat meal decreased the Cmax 
of the oral suspension by 33% in healthy volunteers and no effect on the AUC was observed. 
Therefore, the decrease in Cmax is clinically not relevant, since it is not expected that the efficacy will 
be influenced and decreased exposure does not lead to additional safety issues.
Pharmacokinetics in target population
Study JAHV is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, withdrawal, safety and efficacy study of 
oral baricitinib in patients from 2 years to less than 18 years old with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. This 
study was conducted at 75 centres that screened and randomised patients in 20 countries (Argentina, 
Australia,  Austria,  Belgium,  Brazil,  China,  Czech  Republic,  Germany,  Denmark,  Spain,  France,  United 
Kingdom, Israel, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Poland, Russia, and Turkey). Subjects were enrolled in 4

Subjects aged 9 to <18 years received a dose of 4 mg once daily and subjects aged 2 to <9 years 
received a dose of 2 mg once daily for approximately 2 weeks. All patients <6 years of age received 
oral suspension. Patients aged 6 years or older and <12 years, had the option of receiving either the 
oral suspension or tablet. Patients aged 12 years and older received tablets. At Day 1, patients will 
take baricitinib and PK samples will be collected 15 minutes and 1 hour post-dose. At Day 4, patients 
will take their investigational product at home. The first blood sampling collected during this visit is 
collected 2 hours after the dose is taken. The second blood sample is collected 4 hours after the dose 
is taken. At Day 14, a PK sample will be collected before baricitinib is taken. Immediately after the PK 
sample is collected, the patient will take baricitinib. A PK sample will also be collected at each of the

following times after the dose is given: 30 minutes and 6 hours. In addition, PK samples were obtained 
during OLLI assessment and blood samples were collected at Week 2 (2 to 4 hours post-dose), Week 4 
(4 to 6 hours post-dose), Week 8 (pre-dose) and Week 12 (pre-dose). All samples were analysed 
within 347 days of collection. PopPK modelling was used to obtain PK parameters from the measured 
concentrations. Subjects had a mean age of 13.0 ± 3.4 years (2-17 years), a mean body weight of 
48.5 ± 16.7 kg (11.0-90.1 kg), and a mean BMI of 19.9 ± 4.2 kg/m2 (11.8-30.3 kg/m2). The PK 
parameters are summarised in Panel 3. Population PK analysis showed that CL/F and apparent volume 
of distribution decrease with decrease in body weight and age.

Since weight is a more physiologically relevant patient factor, the effect of weight on the Cmax and AUC 
was further evaluated to identify an optimal weight cut off value for dosing. PopPK was used to predict 
the PK with dosing based on body weight. The results are shown in Panel 4.

The exposure in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis with the current posology is higher 
than observed in healthy volunteers. In addition, the Cmax is higher in paediatric patients with juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis weighing <30 kg with the current posology compared to adult patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis and alopecia areata. The Cmax in paediatric patients with juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis weighing ≥30 kg and the AUC in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
weighing <30 kg and ≥30 kg appears comparable to adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis, atopic 
dermatitis and alopecia areata.
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics
Mechanism of action
Baricitinib is a selective and reversible inhibitor of JAK1 and JAK2. In isolated enzyme assays, 
baricitinib inhibited the activities of JAK1, JAK2, Tyrosine Kinase 2 and JAK3 with IC50 values of 5.9, 
5.7, 53 and > 400 nM, respectively.
JAKs are enzymes that transduce intracellular signals from cell surface receptors for a number of 
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 24/110
cytokines and growth factors involved in haematopoiesis, inflammation and immune function. Within 
the intracellular signalling pathway, JAKs phosphorylate and activate signal transducers and activators 
of transcription (STATs), which activate gene expression within the cell. Baricitinib modulates these 
signalling pathways by partially inhibiting JAK1 and JAK2 enzymatic activity, thereby reducing the 
phosphorylation and activation of STATs.
Primary and Secondary pharmacology
In vitro assays indicate that baricitinib is a selective inhibitor of JAKs with potency and selectivity for 
JAK1 and JAK2 and less potency for JAK3 or TYK2 (Fridman et al. 2010). Inflammatory cytokines, like 
IL-6 and TNF, are considered associated with the immunopathology of JIA. Baricitinib inhibits the cell 
signalling through the JAK-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway and JAK1 
and JAK 2, which in response decreases expression of IL-6 and TNF, respectively.
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology
Following the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence, dissolution comparison of the 1 mg and 
2 m strengths were provided at pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8 in 900 mL fluid at 37°C and at 50 rpm using a 
paddle apparatus. Similar dissolution was shown between the 1 mg and 2 mg strength and therefore 
the biowaiver of strength was granted.
The Applicant provided a bioequivalence study of the 2 mg/mL oral suspension (with and without 
concomitant water intake) versus the 4 mg commercial tablet. The oral suspension requested by PDCO 
as part of the agreed PIP, is currently not part of the line extension and dispersion of the tablet is 
proposed for paediatric patients not able to swallow the tablet. The Applicant provided in vitro data 
that the tablet is dispersable as described in the SmPC section 4.2 and 6.6 and dispersion can be used 
for patients not able to swallow the tablet.
The same validated analytical method was used to determine the plasma concentrations in studies 
JAGU and JAHV as in the Marketing Authorisation application. No effect of age is expected in children 
aged 2 years and older, therefore the approach of the Applicant to use the already developed PopPK 
model to determine the PK in juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients aged 2 to <18 years is acceptable.
The 2 mg/mL oral suspension is bioequivalent to the 4 mg tablet (95% CI for the Cmax, AUC0-last and 
AUC0-inf were between 80 and 125). The pharmacokinetics of baricitinib are dose-proportional over the 
clinical dose range of 1 to 4 mg baricitinib; therefore, the exposure results obtained with the oral 
suspension in study JAHV can be used to predict the exposure following intake of a tablet. The oral 
suspension and tablets are switchable as indicated. For the treatment of JIA, the proposed dose of 
baricitinib is 4 mg once daily for patients weighing 30 kg or greater. For patients weighing less than 30 
kg, the recommended dose is 2 mg once daily. Section 5.2 of the SmPC was updated accordingly. The 
dose is reduced by half for patients using strong Organic Anion Transporter 3 (OAT3) inhibitors or with 
a creatinine clearance between 30 and 60 mL/min.
The peak and total exposure in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis with the current 
posology is higher than observed in healthy volunteers. In addition, the Cmax is higher in paediatric 
patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis weighing <30 kg with the current posology compared to adult 
patients with rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis and alopecia areata. The AUC in paediatric patients 
with juvenile idiopathic arthritis weighing ≥30 kg and the AUC in paediatric patients with juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis weighing <30 kg and ≥30 kg appears comparable compared to adult patients with 
rheumatoid arthritis, atopic dermatitis and alopecia areata. The number of patients weighing 10 to <20 
kg and 20 to <30 kg at baseline of study JAHV was small which hampers the safety evaluation in light 
of the higher exposure observed, especially in subjects weighing 10 to <20 kg.
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 25/110
Due to the higher exposure in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis weighing <30 kg, the 
probability of developing adverse events could increase. However, reducing the dose to 1 mg once 
daily would lead to too low exposure and could compromise efficacy. Therefore, based on the available 
data the posology paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis weighing <30 kg is acceptable, 
as reflected in the section 4.2 of the SmPC.
To address the probability of increased adverse reaction in the paediatric subpopulation, the CHMP 
requested the Applicant to follow up the safety in this subgroup post-authorisation. The Applicant 
agreed to add Study JAHX as a Category 3 PASS of the RMP to evaluate the long-term safety 
paediatric patients weighing <30 kg. The Applicant also agreed to routinely monitor events reported 
from post-marketing sources and that any significant findings will be reported in Periodic Safety 
Update Reports (PSURs).
The effect of food intake on the PK of the oral suspension was investigated. A high-fat meal decreased 
the Cmax of the oral suspension by 33% in healthy volunteers, and no effect on the AUC was observed. 
Therefore, the decrease in Cmax is not considered clinically relevant. The oral suspension can, similar to 
the tablet, be given independently of food.
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology
The pharmacokinetics of baricitinib in paediatric patients with JIA have been sufficiently characterised. 
The following posology in JIA patients 2 years and older is endorsed by the CHMP: 4 mg once daily for 
patients weighing 30 kg or greater, 2 mg once daily for patients weighing less than 30 kg and the dose 
is reduced by half for patients using strong Organic Anion Transporter 3 (OAT3) inhibitors or with a 
creatinine clearance between 30 and 60 mL/min.
Similar dissolution was shown between the 1 mg and 2 mg strength and therefore the biowaiver of 
strength can be granted. The Applicant performed a bioequivalence study of the 2 mg/mL oral 
suspension (with and without concomitant water intake) versus the 4 mg commercial tablet. The 2 
mg/mL oral suspension is bioequivalent to the 4 mg tablet (95% CI for the Cmax, AUC0-last and AUC0-inf 
were between 80 and 125 according to the acceptance region for bioequivalence). Further safety data 
in paediatric patients weighing <30 kg will be provided as a Category 3 PASS of the RMP.
The Applicant provided in vitro data that the tablet is dispersible and dispersion in water can be used 
for patients who are not able to swallow the tablet, which is endorsed by CHMP.
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy
The baricitinib clinical development programme for JIA includes one pivotal Phase 3 study (IV-MC-
JAHV) and 1 supportive long-term extension study (IV MC JAHX); the long-term extension study is still 
ongoing. Dosing for JIA was based on PK/PD modelling of data in RA; the intended doses of 4 mg and 
2 mg that were based on age range, were tested in the PK phase of the pivotal study JAHV.
2.6.5.1.  Dose response studies
A dose response study has not been performed. Instead, the dose selection for the pivotal JAHV trial 
(open-label and randomised withdrawal phases) was based on modelling using PK data of adults with 
RA, and verified in age cohorts in the initial PK/safety phase of the pivotal study. The age cohorts were 
12 to less than 18 years, 6 to less than 12 years, and 2 to less than 6 years, with 5-8 participants per 
cohort. The dose that was derived from the PK modelling in RA adults was: 4 mg for children aged 9 
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 26/110
years and above and adolescents up to 18 years, and 2 mg for children less than 9 years of age. The 
dose proposed in the SmPC however is weight based: 4 mg QD for patients ≥30 kg and 2 mg QD for 
patients <30 kg, for patients aged 2-18 years.
2.6.5.2.  Main study

Treatments
Experimental treatment
The intended doses of baricitinib of 2 mg and 4 mg were based on PK modelling of data of adults with 
RA (see PK section) and could be adjusted during and after the safety/PK period of the pivotal trial.
The dose of baricitinib was stratified by age: 4-mg for children ≥9 years of age and adolescents 12 to 
<18 years of age and 2-mg for children <9 years of age. Baricitinib was provided as 4 mg or 2 mg 
tablets, or as ready-to-use suspension in a bottle containing 2-mg/mL of baricitinib; and matching 
placebo formulations in the double-blind withdrawal phase. All patients <6 years of age received oral 
suspension; patients ≥6 to <12 years old had the option of receiving the oral suspension or the 
tablets; patients >12 years old received tablets. 
Treatment compliance
Patient compliance with study medication was assessed at each visit up to week 44. Patients were 
considered noncompliant if they missed ≥20% of the prescribed doses, or if they intentionally or 
repeatedly took more than the prescribed amount of study medication. Patients found to be non-
compliant were provided with counselling intended to improve compliance.
Concomitant treatment

Additional drugs were to be avoided unless required to treat adverse events (AEs) or for the treatment 
of an ongoing medical condition. Treatment with concomitant JIA therapies during the study was 
permitted within dose limits and while on stable dose, use of more than 1 concomitant DMARD was not 
allowed (Panel 5). The dosages of concomitant treatment could be adjusted only for safety reasons. 
Not permitted were: biological DMARDs; parenteral corticosteroids; live vaccines within 28 days prior 
to baseline (except booster immunization with attenuated vaccine for MMR or VZV).

 Objectives
The primary objective of study JAHV was to evaluate the efficacy of baricitinib versus placebo; 
secondary objectives included evaluations of efficacy, PK, PD, safety, acceptability, and palatability of 
baricitinib, in children from 2 years to less than 18 years of age with non-systemic JIA, who have had 
an inadequate response or intolerance to treatment with at least 1 conventional or biological DMARD.
 Outcomes/endpoints
Primary outcome
The primary outcome is time-to-flare from time of randomisation at week 12, to the end of the double-
blind withdrawal period. Flare was defined as a worsening of ≥30% in at least 3 of the 6 PedACR core 
criteria for JIA and an improvement of ≥30% in no more than 1 of the criteria. 
Secondary Outcomes
The secondary outcomes were assessed during the both the open-label lead-in period and during the 
double-blind withdrawal period, unless denoted otherwise. Main secondary outcomes were:

(Filocamo et al. 2010).
Parent’s Global Assessment of Well-Being. The instrument is a 0 to 100 mm VAS assessing the

ACR50, ACR70, ACR90, and ACR100 responses are calculated as improvements of at least 50%, 70%, 
90% and 100%, respectively, in the PedACR Core Set values listed above.
The JADAS-27 score is a validated composite disease activity measure for JIA (Consolaro et al. 2012) 
using the 27-joint count (Bazso et al. 2009) and hsCRP or ESR (Nordal et al. 2012). The JADAS-27 
score was determined based on 4 components: Physician’s Global Assessment of Disease Activity; 
Parent’s Global Assessment of Well-Being; Number of joints with active disease (27-joint count); ESR.
Remission is defined as inactive disease for at least 24 consecutive weeks (Wallace et al. 2012). 
Inactive disease is indicated by the presence of all of the following (Wallace et al. 2011):

The PASI (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) combines assessments of the extent of body-surface 
involvement in 4 anatomical regions (head, trunk, arms, and legs). It also assesses the severity of 
erythema (redness), plaque induration/infiltration (thickness), and desquamation (scaling) in each 
region, yielding an overall score of 0 to 72 (Fredriksson and Pettersson 1978; Mease 2011). The body 
scores are multiplied by the disease severity score and the weighting for each body area, yielding a 
score between 0 and 72, with higher scores indicating more manifestations of psoriasis.
The SPARCC enthesitis index (Spondyloarthritis Research Consortium of Canada Enthesitis Index) was 
used to measure the severity of enthesitis, using absence (0) or presence (1) of enthesitis at 16 sites, 
and ranges from 0 to 16 (Maksymowych et al. 2009). 
The JSpADA (Juvenile Spondyloarthritis Disease Activity Index) was used to evaluate the disease 
activity of juvenile spondyloarthritis (Weiss et al. 2014). The range of possible scores is 0 to 8, where 
higher scores indicate more disease activity. The JSpADA has 8 graded components:

The CHAQ (Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire) assesses health status and physical function 
in children with juvenile arthritis over the past week, which the parent or legal guardian completes, 
regardless of the age of the patient. The CHAQ Disability Index contains 30 items grouped into the 
following 8 domains (not including assistive devices/aids questions): dressing and grooming, arising, 
eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip, and activities. The domains are averaged to calculate the 
Disability Index (physical function) which ranges from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more 
disability (Singh et al. 1994). Pain assessment due to illness, which is a 0 to 100 mm VAS that 
assesses the current level of pain severity over the past week, where 0 = ‘No pain’ and 100 = ‘Very 
severe pain’. 
The CHQ-PF50 (Childhood Health Questionnaire-Parent Form 50) is a generic observer-reported 
instrument designed to capture the health-related quality of life of children and adolescents (from 5- to 
18-years of age), as well as the impact of the child’s disease on the caregivers (HealthActCHQ 2013). 
The CHQ-PF50 is completed by the caregivers and has been validated for use in patients with JIA 
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 33/110
(Ruperto et al. 2001). The CHQ-PF50 consists of 50 questions covering 14 health concepts: Global 
Health; Physical Functioning; Role/Social Limitations-Physical; Role/Social Limitations-
Emotional/Behavioral; Bodily Pain/Discomfort; General Behavior; Mental Health; Self-Esteem; General 
Health Perceptions; Change in Health; Parental Impact-Emotion; Parental Impact-Time; Family-
Activities; and Family-Cohesion. From these subscales, 2 summary scores are calculated, the Physical 
Summary Score (PhS) and Psychosocial Summary Score (PsS).
 Sample size
The sample size was determined to provide 80% power for detecting an absolute reduction of 25% in 
the proportion of patients experiencing flare in the double-blind withdrawal (DBW) period using a two-
sided significance level of 5%. The proportion of patients experiencing flare was assumed to be 60% 
under placebo and 35% under baricitinib. The calculated required number of patients to be randomised 
in the DBW period was 128 (64 per treatment arm), assuming a drop-out rate of less than 10%. To 
reach this number, 197 patients needed to be included in the open-label lead-in (OLLI) period, 
assuming that 65% meet the criterion of PediACR30 response required for inclusion in the DBW period. 
A futility analysis was planned after the first 100 patients completed the OLLI period. The study would 
stop for futility if less than 50% of these patients had a PediACR30 response.
 Randomisation and Blinding (masking)
Patients included in the DBW part of the study were randomised 1:1 to age-based doses of baricitinib 
or placebo. Randomisation was stratified by history of prior bDMARD use, JIA category and in 
polyarticular patients by pre-dose exposure erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Assignment was 
determined by a computer-generated random sequence and using an interactive web-response 
system. The experimental treatment was matched with placebo tablets or suspension, as appropriate. 
All study assessments were performed by study personnel who were blinded to the patient's treatment 
group. To prevent potential unblinding due to observed efficacy or laboratory changes, two different 
assessors were used for assessing efficacy and safety outcomes.
 Statistical methods
Analysis populations are defined in Panel 7. Efficacy analyses for the DBW study were conducted 
following the ITT principle including all the patients that were randomized. Safety analyses were 
restricted to patients that received at least one 1 dose of baricitinib or placebo (for the DBW safety 
population) or at least 1 dose of baricitinib (for the general safety population). 
Panel 7 Overview of efficacy and safety analysis populations for OLLI and DBW
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 34/110
All statistical tests will be performed at a two-sided significance level of 5%. The primary endpoint of 
time-to-flare will be analysed using Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared between treatment arms 
using a stratified log-rank test. In addition, Cox proportional hazard regression analyses adjusted for 
stratification factors may be performed for which hazard ratio and its 95% confidence interval will be 
reported as effect size. Patients that do no experience flare during the DBW period or discontinue 
earlier without flare will be censored. Similarity of treatment effect on time-to-flare will be compared 
across JIA categories using Cox regression analysis adjusted for stratification factors. The SAP further 
states that redundant variables will be removed from the models. 
Categorical secondary endpoints for the DBW phase will be compared between the treatment arms 
using logistic regression adjusting for stratification factors. Continuous secondary endpoints for the 
DBW phase will be compared between arms using ANCOVA adjusted for stratification factors. A mixed 
model for repeated measurements (MMRM) will be considered as a supplementary analysis for the 
continuous endpoints. For secondary endpoints defined for the OLLI phase will be summarised without 
inferential statistics. Categorial safety endpoints for the DBW phase will be compared between arms 
using the chi-squared test. ANCOVA will be used for continuous safety variables in the DBW safety 
population. Secondary endpoints are not included in a prespecified hierarchical testing strategy.  
The SAP specifies a general censoring rule that states that all efficacy outcomes collected after 
permanent study drug continuation will be excluded from analyses. LOCF will be used for the 
continuous endpoints after flare (a while-on-treatment estimand strategy). Non-responder imputation 
will be used for those failing to remain on study treatment (a composite estimand strategy). 
The following subgrouping variables may be considered for efficacy analyses: gender, age group, 
geographic region, baseline use of MTX, history or prior use of bDMARD, baseline ESR category, JIA 
subtype, and baseline corticosteroid use.
Results
 Participant flow
A total of N=220 patients had enrolled the study (Figure 2). There were n=29 patients included in the 
PK/Safety part of the study, while n=191 patients were directly enrolled into the open-label lead-in 
period. Of the n=163 (74%) patients who completed the open-label lead-in period, n=82 were 
randomised to baricitinib and n=81 were randomised to placebo. The most common reasons for 
discontinuation were: failure to meet randomisation criteria in n=38 patients (17% of total) at the end 
of the open-label lead-in period; failure to meet continuation criteria in the randomised withdrawal 
period for n=41 patients (51%) of the placebo group and for n=16 patients (20%) of the baricitinib 
group. The withdrawals for other reasons (adverse events, physician decision, withdrawal by subject, 
other reasons) occurred with similar frequency in both groups, with 9 withdrawals in the placebo group 
and 10 withdrawals in the baricitinib group.

Protocol deviations
In the PK/Safety and open-label lead-in periods, there were n=51 patients (23%) with important 
protocol deviations. In the randomised withdrawal period, n=17 patients (21%) in the placebo group 
and n=14 patients (17%) in the baricitinib group had important protocol deviations. Compliance issues 
included patients who did not return the investigational product to the visit, meaning that the degree 
of compliance could not be calculated. The use of unallowed co-medication included starting an NSAID 
or analgesic, or a case of quitting MTX in the baricitinib group; new DMARDs were not started. Issues 
with source documents most often were data recorded on paper or remote, instead of the e-CRF. 
Issues with Informed Consent usually were untimely signing/agreement of the IC form after an update.
 Recruitment
The first patient's first visit was performed on 17 December 2018, and the last patient's last visit was 
performed on 26 January 2022. The analyses presented in the CSR of study JAHV are based on a 
database lock date of 16 March 2022.
The study was conducted at 75 centres that screened and randomised patients in 20 countries 
(Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, China, Czech Republic, Germany, Denmark, Spain, 
France, United Kingdom, Israel, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Poland, Russia, and Turkey). Of the 220 
patients enrolled, 150 patients (68%) were enrolled though centres in European countries.
 Conduct of the study
The initial protocol of study JADV was approved by the MAH at 05 July 2018. The protocol has been 
amended four times: amended protocol a) on 14 March 2019, b) on 15 April 2019, c) on 15 August 
2020, d) on 07 November 2020. 
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 36/110
With amendment c): Baseline assessment of sexual maturity (Tanner Staging) in patients >8 years old 
was included based on feedback from regulatory agencies. Height measurements were added for all 
study visits to allow for additional growth monitoring. X-ray imaging was added based on feedback 
from regulatory agencies for additional monitoring of bone growth and assessment of symptomatic 
areas of bones/joints. Semi-annual wrist, hand, finger, and AP knee radiographs were included to 
monitor bone age and long bone growth. For patients already enrolled in JAHV at the time of this 
amendment, the X-ray procedures were optional. 
Audits had been performed in 6 centres.
 Baseline data
At baseline of the PK/safety and open-label lead-in periods (N=220), the mean (SD) age of the 
patients was 13 (3) years. Included were n=6 (2.7%) patients of ≥2 to 6 years, n=9 (4.1%) patients 
of ≥6 to 9 years, n=30 (14%) of ≥9 to 12 years, and n=175 (80%) of ≥12 to 18 years of age. Most 
(70%) patients were female, and the vast majority (71%) was Caucasian. The mean (SD) weight of 
the patients was 50 (17) kg, with a mean (SD) length of 155 (18) cm and a mean (SD) BMI of 20 
(4.5). After randomisation, these figures were basically similar in the placebo (n=81) and baricitinib 
(n=82) groups. The exception is that for the youngest age group of ≥2 to 6 years, only 1 patient was 
randomised to placebo and 5 were randomised to baricitinib.

 Outcomes and estimation
Primary outcome
The baseline of the analysis of time-to-flare was week 12, which was the start of the randomised 
withdrawal period of up to 32 weeks. By study week 44, 14 (17%) patients receiving baricitinib had a 
disease flare as compared with 41 (51%) patients receiving placebo (Figure 3). Patients receiving 
baricitinib were significantly less likely to experience disease flare when compared with those receiving 
placebo (hazard ratio = 0.241, p-value: <.001).

Figure 3 Time-to-flare comparison between baricitinib and placebo in the randomised withdrawal period 
of study JAHV
In the combined subgroup of patients with polyarticular and extended oligoarticular JIA (Figure 4), the 
proportions of patients with a flare were 53% in the placebo group and 18% in the baricitinib group, 
with a hazard ratio of 0.23 (p<0.001). In the combined subgroup of patients with ERA and juvenile PsA 
(Error! Reference source not found.), the proportions of patients with a flare were 44% in the 
placebo group and 15% in the baricitinib group, with a hazard ratio of 0.33 (p=0.072).
In the subgroup of patients with polyarticular JIA, the proportion of patients with a flare was 51% 
(26/51) for placebo and 18% (10/57) for baricitinib (p<0.001). In the subgroup of patients with 
extended oligoarticular JIA, the proportion of patients with a flare was 71% (5/7) for placebo and 20% 
(1/5) for baricitinib (p=0.24). In the subgroup of patients with ERA, the proportion of patients with a 
flare was 50% (10/20) for placebo and 19% (3/16) for baricitinib (p=0.083). In the subgroup of 
patients with juvenile PsA, no patients flared in the placebo group (n=3) nor in the baricitinib group 
(n=4).

Secondary outcomes in the open-label phase
The open-label period started at first age-based dose and ended at week 12 or with early 
discontinuation. A total of 167 (76%) patients reached a PedACR30 response at Week 12 of the 
combined PK/Safety and open-label lead-in period. The proportion of patients with a PedACR50 
response was 64%, with PedACR70 was 46%, with PedACR90 response was 20%, and a PedACR100 
response was reached in 10% (Panel 10). PedACR30 and PedACR50 responses varied between 79% - 
60% and 69% - 60% over JIA subtypes. The 6 PedACR components all showed numerical 
improvements from baseline over weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12 (Panel 11).

In total, 16 (7.3%) patients reached a status of inactive disease during or at week 12. The mean (SD) 
JADAS-27 score at baseline was 21.7 (8.8) and was decreased with mean (SE) of -12.4 (0.5) at week 
12. The mean (SD) CHAQ Pain score at baseline was 55 (25) and was decreased with a mean (SE) of -
25 (1.6) at week 12. 
The mean PASI score for patients with JPsA (n=10) improved from baseline to week 12. The mean 
(SD) PASI score at baseline was 0.98 (1.8) and decreased with a mean (SE) of -0.65 (0.3) at week 12. 
In patients with enthesitis (ERA, jPsA), the mean (SD) SPARCC Enthesitis Index at baseline (n=59) 
was 3.2 (4.5) and decreased with a mean (SE) of -1.0 (0.3) at week 12. The mean (SD) JSpADA score 
at baseline (n=54) was 3.8 (1.3) and decreased with a mean (SE) of -1.2 (0.2) at week 12.
In CHQ-PF50 Phs, there was a mean (SE) improvement in Physical summary score of 13.1 (0.86) at 
week 12, while the mean (SD) score at baseline was 24.9 (14.8). In CHQ-PF50 PsS, there was a mean 
(SE) improvement in Psychosocial summary score of 5.4 (0.55) at week 12, while the mean (SD) score 
at baseline was 42.8 (10.9).
Secondary outcomes in the randomised withdrawal phase
The randomised withdrawal period started at the time of randomisation and ended when patients had a 
flare (time-to-flare was the primary outcome), at study week 44, or at earlier discontinuation.
Regarding PedACR responses, a total of 67% of patients receiving baricitinib, and 38% of patients 
receiving placebo reached a PedACR30 response (p<.001), Figure 5). A total of 63% of patients 
receiving baricitinib, and 37% of patients receiving placebo reached a PedACR50 response (p=0.002).

Also for PedACR70, 90, but not 100, between-group differences were (borderline) statistically 
significant at week 44 (Panel 12). During the randomised withdrawal period, the values of the 6 
components of the PedACR decreased from week 12 (baseline) up to week 44 in both treatment 
groups, while the changes in the 6 components were all numerically larger in the baricitinib group, as 
compared to the placebo group (Figure 6 for joint counts).

In the proportion of patients with inactive disease, there were no significant differences between 
treatment groups at any week, including week 44. At week 44, there were 11 (14%) patients with 
inactive disease in the placebo group and 19 (23%) in the baricitinib group (p=0.11).
The mean change in JADAS-27 score showed statistically significant differences between treatment 
groups at weeks 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, and 44 (Panel 13). At week 44, the mean (SE) change in 
JADAS-27 was -9.9 (1.0) in the placebo group and -14.2 (1.0) in the baricitinib group (p=0.001).

In CHAQ pain severity, a statistically significant difference between treatment groups was observed at 
weeks 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, and 44.  At week 44, the mean (SE) change in CHAQ pain severity was -
16.7 (3.2) in the placebo group and -29.7 (3.3) in the baricitinib group (p=0.003).
In patients with juvenile PsA, at week 44 the mean (SE) change from baseline in PASI score was -0.8 
(0.4) in the patients (n=3) on placebo and -1.2 (0.3) in patients (n=4) on baricitinib (p=0.57). Within 
each treatment group, the within-group changes were numerically similar over time, from week 20 up 
to and including week 44 .
In patients with juvenile PsA or with ERA, at week 44 the mean (SE) change in SPARCC enthesitis 
index was -1.9 (0.2) in the placebo (n=23) group and -1.5 (0.3) in the baricitinib (n=20) group 
(p=0.21). Within each treatment group, the within-group changes were numerically similar over time.
In patients with juvenile PsA or with ERA, at week 44 the mean (SE) change in JSpADA index was -1.5 
(0.3) in the placebo (n=23) group and -2.6 (0.3) in the baricitinib (n=20) group (p=0.019). 
In CHQ-PF50 Phs, at week 44 the mean (SE) change from baseline was 10.5 (1.7) in the placebo group 
and 16.5 (1.7) in the baricitinib group (p=0.009). Statistically significant differences between the 
treatment groups in favour of the baricitinib group were observed at weeks 24, 28, 32, 36, 40 and 44. 
In CHQ-PF50 PsS, at week 44 the mean (SE) change from baseline was 4.7 (1.1) in the placebo group 
and 6.1 (1.1) in the baricitinib group (p=0.36). A statistically significant difference between the 
treatment groups, in favour of the baricitinib group (p=0.043), was observed at week 20.
 Ancillary analyses
Results of subgroup analysis for time-to-flare (primary outcome) in the randomised withdrawal period 
showed that the treatment effect (hazard ratio) was consistent in size over subgroups of: prior 
biological DMARD use (yes/no), MTX use at baseline (yes/no), baseline ESR elevated (yes/no), JIA 
subtype (polyarticular and extended oligoarticular/juvenile PsA and ERA), female/male, age (≥9 / <9), 
region EU, corticosteroid use at baseline (yes/no), weight class (≥30 kg/<30 kg). The majority of 
hazard ratios lay in the range between 0,22 – 0,30 with p-values <0.001, while the overall treatment 
effect in time-to-flare had a hazard ratio of 0.24. Exceptions were the treatment effect in the juvenile 
PsA and ERA group with a non-significant p-value (HR=0.33, p=0.072), while smaller effects were 
found in the subgroups of age<9 years (HR=0.15, p=0.11) and with corticosteroid use at baseline 
(HR=0.14, p<0.011). 
The treatment effects of baricitinib versus placebo on time-to-flare are also shown in the survival 
curves of subgroups of: methotrexate at baseline (yes) and age groups of 9 and older and younger 
than 9 (Figure 7). Survival curves for JIA subtypes have been presented above, in connection to the 
primary outcome.

Title: A Phase 3 Multicentre Study to Evaluate the Long-Term Safety and Efficacy of 
Baricitinib in Patients from 1 Year to <18 Years of Age with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis 
(I4V-MC-JAHX)
Objectives
The objectives are to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability and the long-term efficacy of 
baricitinib in patients with JIA or systemic JIA.
Design
Study JAHX is a multicentre, long-term extension study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
baricitinib in patients with JIA. The treatment period lasts up to 264 weeks (5 years). Patients who 
participated in an originating study (Study JAHV or JAHU) are eligible for enrolment in Study JAHX. 
The patients followed the age-based dosing strategy of the original trial (2 mg QD for patients <9 
years of age and 4 mg QD for patients ≥9 years of age, which includes oral suspension for patients <6 
years, tablets for patients ≥12, and a choice option for patients aged in between. The age-based dose 
and formulation was adjusted if the patient entered the next age cohort during the study. Patients 
were allowed to continue to receive concomitant treatments for JIA used during the study in which 
they were previously enrolled. MTX or other cDMARDs could be initiated or the dose increased, but all 
bDMARD and other JAK inhibitor therapies were prohibited. A change in analgesics/NSAIDs dosing or 
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 49/110
the addition of analgesics/NSAIDs was permitted. Initiating oral corticosteroids and increasing/ 
decreasing oral corticosteroid dose was allowed. Intra-articular joint and bursal corticosteroid injections 
could be given.
Efficacy outcomes included, amongst others: the proportion of patients who achieve 
PedACR30/50/70/90/100 response rates using a baseline of the originator study, the proportion of 
patients who maintain PedACR30/50/70/90/100 response rates from baseline of the current study; the 
proportion of patients with a durable PedACR30/50/70/90/100 response from the time of 
randomisation in the originator study; the proportion of patients who have disease flare; time to 
disease flare. The scheduled visits in JAHX are approximately 12 weeks apart, while these were 
approximately 4 weeks apart in JAHV.
Results
Conduct of the study
A total of 199 patients entered Study JAHX from Study JAHV and were included in the JAHX ITT 
population for interim analysis at data cut-off date of 21 April 2022. 
Patient disposition
A total of 199 patients entered Study JAHX from JAHV and were included in the JAHX ITT population. 
At the time of data cut-off, 174 patients were ongoing in the study. The most common reasons for 
discontinuation were: lack of efficacy (n = 9, 4.5%), withdrawal by subject (n = 9, 4.5%), and adverse 
event (n = 5, 2.5%). It was determined that 97 (49%) patients had at least 1 important protocol 
deviation; the most common reasons for important protocol deviation were related to: informed 
consent (57, 29%), data quality/source documents (29, 15%), and study procedures (25, 13%).
Exposure
The mean (SD) time of exposure was 59 (29) weeks, with 226 patient-years. In total, 196 patients 
were analysed for the determination of compliance with treatment. 186 patients were deemed 
compliant as they did not miss 20% or more of the prescribed doses during the study.
Baseline
The mean (SD) age of patients was 14 (3.1) years and most (69%) patients were female. The mean 
(SD) BMI was 20 (4). The majority of patients were Caucasian (70%) followed by Asian (23%).
Efficacy
The proportion of patients who achieve PedACR30/50/70/90/100 response using their baseline values 
in study JAHV shows that after 48 weeks (n=126), 89% have at least PedACR30, while 81% have 
PedACR50 and 66% PedACR70, PedACR90 is reached by 49%. The proportions of patients with 
responses tended to increase over time, seen from baseline of study JAHX (Panel 15).

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy
Design and conduct of clinical studies
Design
The overall study design, with an open-label lead-in period of 12 weeks, followed by a randomised 
double-blind withdrawal phase for patients with at least some response (PedACR30) and time-to-flare 
as primary outcome, in patients at least 2 years of age with JIA according to ILAR categories, is in line 
with the expectations, as expressed in the Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for 
the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (EMA/CHMP/239770/2014 Rev. 2). Use of placebo as a 
comparator is acceptable in light of the randomised withdrawal design.
Patient population
The selected JIA study population of 2-18 years of age is in line with the guideline and in line with the 
proposed indication. The diagnoses according to ILAR subtypes are endorsed, and the definitions of 
‘active’ disease and of failure to previous treatment with a conventional or biologic DMARD are agreed. 
The exclusion criteria are considered reasonable and not overly restrictive. Patients with active uveitis 
at baseline were not included and uveitis has not been followed as an efficacy outcome, but it has been 
covered as TEAE (see Safety section).
The baseline demographic variables appear representative for the target population. Although the vast 
majority (80%) of patients was adolescent and most (65%) of patients had polyarticular disease, it 
appears that sufficient data are available for all JIA subtypes and age classes to extrapolate efficacy. 
Because of the low prevalence of JIA and its subtypes over age classes, it is expected to rely on 
extrapolation to some extent, as explained in the EMA Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal 
products for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (EMA/CHMP/239770/2014 Rev. 2).
A majority (68%) of patients was included through centres in European countries, which supports the 
translation of study results to children with JIA living in the EU. 
Based on the average (SD) values of disease activity assessments and the inclusion criteria, the 
included patients will have active disease at baseline, as expected. Overall it seems that at baseline of 
the randomised-withdrawal phase the patients in the baricitinib group where somewhat more ill than 
the patients in the placebo group, regarding level of active joints and because at baseline more 
patients used concomitant methotrexate and corticosteroid use. This not necessarily has led to 
unconservative bias for efficacy comparisons. In time to flare (primary outcome), the treatment effect 
(HR) comparing baricitinib with placebo was basically similar over these subgroups. 
All patients entering study JAHV had taken prior DMARDs, 97% had used csDMARDs and 53% had 
used biologics. The included population therefore is in line with the target population of JIA patients 
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 52/110
‘who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more prior conventional synthetic or 
biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)’. 
Treatment and dose
A dose-response study has not been performed. Instead, dose selection for the pivotal JAHV trial 
(open-label and randomised withdrawal phases) was based on modelling using PK data of adults with 
RA, and verified in age cohorts in the initial PK/safety phase of the pivotal study. The dose that was 
derived from the PK modelling in RA adults was: 4 mg for children aged 9 years and above and 
adolescents up to 18 years, and 2 mg for children less than 9 years of age, and this dose regimen was 
carried forward in pivotal trial JAHV and open-label extension trial JAHX. However, the dose proposed 
in the SmPC is weight-based: 4 mg QD for patients ≥30 kg and 2 mg QD for patients <30 kg, for 
patients aged 2-18 years. This posology is considered acceptable as discussed in the clinical 
pharmacology section.
The experimental treatment, provided as tablets or suspension, appears to be adequately matched by 
placebo in the blinded withdrawal phase. The 1 mg tablet was not used for the study because the 
posology derived from the PK modelling in RA adults was: 4 mg for subjects aged 9 years up to 18 
years, and 2 mg for subjects less than 9 years of age. The 1 mg tablet will be needed in practice as it 
is needed for halving the dose of patients using 2 mg dose when needed for patients using a strong 
OAT3 inhibitor or having reduced renal function. The suspension used in the study is not yet approved. 
For this reason, the Applicant proposed to dissolve tablets in water for those patients who are not able 
to swallow tablets as reflected in sections 4.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC. The Applicant provided data 
supporting the bioequivalence of the 2 mg/ml solution and the 4 mg tablet, which the CHMP considered 
acceptable.
Concomitant treatment with a stable dose of oral corticosteroids of ≤10 mg/day or 0.2 mg/kg/day 
prednisone equivalent, stable use of MTX or another DMARD (not >2 DMARDs), stable use of NSAIDs 
and analgesics, was permitted. This is reasonable, given the requirement of patients having the active 
disease but also an insufficient response to a previous DMARD. Biological DMARDs were not allowed, 
and neither was any previous use of a JAK inhibitor, which is agreed. The discontinuation criteria are 
understood and are in line with what is already included in the SmPC. 
The initially proposed indication included use with concomitant DMARDs. However, most patients used 
methotrexate concomitantly and few patients used other DMARDs. Methotrexate was no effect modifier 
(see subgroups below). Therefore, at the CHMP’s request, the MAH accepted to remove the 
concomitant use of Olumiant with DMARDs from the indication and the indication only includes 
concomitant use with methotrexate.
Outcomes and endpoints
The primary outcome, time-to-flare in the withdrawal portion of the trial, and secondary outcomes, 
including proportion of patients with a flare, PedACR responses, JADAS, pain, concepts of 
remission/low disease activity, PASI, enthesitis, are in line with the expectations, as outlined in the 
Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
(EMA/CHMP/239770/2014 Rev. 2). The use of outcomes assessing functional ability and ‘quality of life’ 
is recommended. These domains are covered by the CHQ-PF50, an internationally recognised 
standarised measurement tool, which is considered reasonably valid for use in patients with JIA 
(Ruperto et al. 2001; Hullmann 2011). No information regarding the validity of CHAQ in JIA was found 
in the dossier, but it also appears to be sufficiently valid (Pouchot et al 2014).
Sample size
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 53/110
The planned sample size of 128 patients in the DBW part yields 80% power to demonstrate a 
difference in proportions of patients experiencing a flare in case 60% of patients on placebo 
experienced flare and 35% of patients on baricitinib.
Randomisation and blinding
Randomisation was stratified by i) history of prior bDMARD use, yes versus no; JIA category, 
polyarticular and extended oligoarticular (combined) versus ERA and JPsA (combined); and in the 
polyarticular patients: Predose exposure erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), elevated (>20 
mm/hour) versus not elevated. The experimental treatment was matched with placebo tablets or 
suspension, as appropriate. All study assessments were performed by study personnel who were 
blinded to the patient's treatment group. To prevent potential unblinding due to observed efficacy or 
laboratory changes, two different assessors were used for assessing efficacy and safety outcomes.
Statistical methods
The primary analysis for comparison of time to flare between placebo and baricitinib in the double-
blind washout study was performed using Kaplan-Meier analysis with the hazard ratio from Cox 
regression reported as effect size. Primary analysis was performed on an ITT basis and censored 
patients that discontinued treatment before experiencing flare or end of treatment assuming censoring 
at random. Secondary endpoints were not included in the confirmatory testing strategy and can 
therefore only be considered supportive. No interim analyses are performed as part of the DBW study.
Study conduct
Although the protocol has been amended 4 times after the study started, the amendments did not 
appear to have complicated the study or the interpretation of results.
Patient disposition
Of the 219 patients entering open-label treatment in the 12-week lead-in period, 56 (26%) dropped 
out, which in most cases (n=38) was a failure to meet randomisation criteria (PedACR30 response) at 
week 12. The drop-out in the open-label phase due to any other reason was ~10% of the total, which 
is acceptable. After randomisation, more patients in the placebo group as compared to the baricitinib 
group dropped out, which can be attributed to failure to meet continuation criteria (a flare defined as a 
worsening of ≥30% in at least 3 of the 6 PedACR core criteria). The important protocol violations do 
not appear to have distorted the assessment of efficacy or safety, not by their nature and not because 
they were grossly equally divided over the two treatment groups.
Efficacy data and additional analyses
Primary outcome
The primary outcome of the pivotal study JAHV was met: patients on baricitinib were less likely to get 
a flare than patients on a placebo. By the end of the randomised withdrawal part of the study, 17% 
(14/81) of patients receiving baricitinib had a disease flare as compared with 51% (41/82) of patients 
receiving placebo, with a hazard ratio of 0.24 (p<0.001). In the placebo group, more than half of the 
number of flares (26/41) occurred within the first 8 weeks, but this also occurred in the baricitinib 
group (9/14). Nevertheless, the survival curves of time-to-flare clearly separate the placebo group 
from the baricitinib group.
It is supportive for the proposed indication that the treatment effect in time-to-flare was present in 
three of the JIA subtypes but not in the small juvenile PsA group where no flares occurred. In the 
subgroup of patients with polyarticular JIA, the proportion of patients with a flare was 51% (26/51) for 
placebo and 18% (10/57) for baricitinib (p<0.001). In the subgroup of patients with extended 
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 54/110
oligoarticular JIA, the proportion of patients with a flare was 71% (5/7) for placebo and 20% (1/5) for 
baricitinib (p=0.24). In the subgroup of patients with ERA, the proportion of patients with a flare was 
50% (10/20) for placebo and 19% (3/16) for baricitinib (p=0.083). In the subgroup of patients with 
juvenile PsA, no patients flared in the placebo group (n=3) nor in the baricitinib group (n=4). Due to 
the small group size, the absence of flares in the jPsA group may be a chance finding. Juvenile PsA is 
known to come with flares, and flares in this subgroup did occur in a similar trial with an IL-17 inhibitor 
or placebo (Cosentyx SmPC), for example. Within-group changes in the jPsA subgroup in the open-
label period were supportive for efficacy, also in psoriasis area severity score (PASI) (see further 
below).
Secondary outcomes
The result for the primary outcome was supported by the main secondary outcomes in the randomised 
withdrawal phase, notably by between-group differences in PedACR30 and higher cut-offs such as 
PedACR50, 70 and 90, the 6 individual PedACR components (number of active joints, number of joints 
with limited ROM, PhGA, Parent GA, CHAQ disability index, ESR), change in JADAS-27, change in CHAQ 
Pain; and to some extent the changes in SPARCC enthesitis index and the JSpADA score in patients 
with juvenile PsA or ERA. In the randomised withdrawal period, the proportion of patients with a 
PedACR30 response steadily decreased from 100% at week 12 to 67% at week 44 in the baricitinib 
group. However, the loss of response on a group level was clearly more pronounced in the placebo 
group in which only 38% of patients still had a PedACR30 response at week 44. The results in 
PedACR30 are supported by the similar trends over time in its 6 individual components, that all show 
numerical improvements over time (statistical analysis was not planned). NRI was used in the 
calculation of PedACR responders, meaning that patients who drop-out due to a flare are counted as 
non-responders, which is agreed. The results in PedACR50 and 70 showed similar trends as the 
PedACR30, while in the baricitinib group the proportions of patients with a PedACR90 or 100 slowly 
increased over time. By the end of the randomised withdrawal phase at week 44, there were 
numerically somewhat more patients with inactive disease in the baricitinib group (23%) as compared 
to the placebo group (14%), which, however, was not statistically significant (p=0.11). The frequency 
of remission (inactive disease for 24 weeks) was declared as a secondary outcome, but results were 
not found in the dossier (not pursued). Based on the low occurrence of patients reaching 
PedACR100/inactive disease (and minimal disease activity, not shown), these ultimate treatment goals 
appear to be difficult with baricitinib in JIA.
As pointed out above, the subgroup of patients with juvenile PsA was small, and the baseline PASI 
scores low, preventing meaningful comparison between baricitinib and placebo, though the numerical 
results in the withdrawal phase do not suggest an absence of effect on PASI. The results on SPARCC 
enthesitis index and JSpADA index in patients with juvenile PsA/ERA were also supportive; 
improvements were numerically and/or statistically significant in favour of baricitinib.
Effects in the open-label period
The treatment effect is also supported by the changes in outcomes during the 12-week open-label 
lead-in period. A total of 167 (76%) patients had a PedACR30 response at Week 12 of the open-label 
period, which means that not all patients reached at least a moderate response (PedACR30) after 12 
weeks of treatment. However, there still were considerable proportions of patients who had a 
PedACR50 response (64%), a PedACR70 response (46%) or a PedACR90 response (20%). Remission, 
or near-remission, was infrequently reached, according to the low (<10%) proportions of patients with 
PedACR100 or inactive disease. Decreases in the 6 components of the PedACR (number of active 
joints, number of joints with limited ROM, PhGA, Parent GA, CHAQ disability index, ESR), JADAS-27 
score, CHAQ Pain, and CHQ-PF50 Physical Summary Score were all supportive, showing numerical 
improvements over the course of 12 weeks. The improvement in CHQ-PF50 Psychosocial Summary 
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 55/110
Score was relatively small. Despite the small group and relatively low PASI score at baseline, the mean 
PASI score for patients with juvenile PsA (n=10) numerically improved from baseline to week 12. In 
patients with ERA or jPsA, the SPARCC enthesitis index and the JSpADA also showed numerical 
improvements.
Clinical relevance
The difference between baricitinib and placebo in occurrence of flare is considered clinically relevant, 
which is notably supported by clinically relevant proportions of patients with a PedACR30, (50, 70 or 
90), large reductions in the joint counts of -7 (active) to -4 (limited ROM) that remain when staying on 
baricitinib in the withdrawal phase, a mean change of -12 in JADAS-27 that exceeds the estimated MID 
of -5.5 (Bulatovic 2013), a change of ~0.5 in CHAQ disability index (range 0-3) which is supported by 
the change in CHQ-PF50 Phs, average changes >20 mm on Parent’s global assessment of well-being 
and CHAQ assessment of pain. It is acknowledged that the study design, with an open-label phase and 
a randomised placebo-controlled withdrawal phase, makes it more difficult to evaluate the clinical 
relevance of the treatment effect of baricitinib, as compared to placebo. However, overall the 
treatment effect in the randomised withdrawal period, supported by changes in the open-label lead-in 
period, is considered to be clinically relevant, and the treatment effect on the primary outcome, time-
to-flare (hazard ratio=0.24; p<0.001) seems – acknowledging all limitations of comparisons from 2 
different studies – to be in line with the effect found for treatment with anti-IL17 (hazard ratio=0.28; 
p<0.001) although the population was ERA and juvenile PsA (Cosentyx SmPC). While reasonable 
numbers of JIA patients reached an overall good response with baricitinib, it appeared still to be 
difficult to reach the ultimate treatment goals of remission/low disease activity within the 1-year 
duration of the pivotal study. After a treatment duration of 1-2 years, the number of patients with low 
disease activity seems to increase (study JAHX, see further below).
Subgroup analysis
According to the results of the subgroup analysis in predefined subgroups, the results on time-to-flare 
in the randomised withdrawal phase appear to be stable across predefined subgroups, including JIA 
subtype, age, weight, concomitant methotrexate use, and within the EU region. The age class is also 
relevant because the dose was stratified by age class (2 mg if <6 years of age and 4 mg if ≥6 years). 
The treatment effect in time-to-flare (proportion with a flare) and PedACR30 is reversed for the 
youngest subgroup of children aged 2 to <6 and for the jPsA subgroup. Both subgroups are limited in 
size: n=6 for the youngest children 2 to <6, and n=7 for the jPsA subgroup, which means that these 
reversed treatment effects may be a chance effect. It is considered that the favourable effects in the 
older children, in other JIA subtypes and adults with PsA, can be generalised to these two subgroups. 
The results in the youngest children are supported by the size of the PedACR30 response in the open-
label phase. The results in the jPsA subgroup are supported by improvements in the open-label phase 
and numerical treatment effects in the randomised-withdrawal phase (PedACR response, PASI, 
SPARCC, JSpADA). Consequently, despite reversed treatment effects in time-to-flare (primary 
outcome) in patients 2 to <6 and in patients with jPsA, it is considered that the efficacy has been 
demonstrated in these subgroups of the target population.
Maintenance of efficacy
In the long-term follow-up study JAHX, 199 patients of the original 219 patients in study JAHV were 
included and 126 patients were followed up to 1 year. The available long-term efficacy data suggest 
that up to approximately one year, the effects of baricitinib on disease activity are generally 
maintained, and few patients got a flare. Follow-up is still limited, but few patients dropped out, which 
is reassuring.
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 56/110
Upon CHMP request, the MAH included in the Section 4.2 of the SmPC a stopping rule for patients with 
JIA, in case of non-response at 12 weeks. This is in line with the design of pivotal study JAHV, which 
had an open-label treatment phase of 12 weeks, after which patients with non-response did not 
proceed to the randomised-withdrawal phase. At the end of the 12-week open-label period, non-
response (according to PedACR30) occurred in 38/220 (17%) of patients.
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy
The primary outcome of the pivotal study JADV was met: patients on baricitinib were less likely to get 
a flare than patients on placebo. By the end of the randomised withdrawal part of the study, 17% of 
patients receiving baricitinib had a disease flare compared to 51% of patients receiving placebo. The 
difference between baricitinib and placebo is clinically relevant and supported by the results of 
secondary outcomes including PedACR responses, the 6 individual components of the PedACR, changes 
in pain and in JADAS-27 score in functioning. 
Most patients used methotrexate, which was not an effect modifier for the primary outcome. At the 
CHMP’s request, the MAH accepted to remove the concomitant use of Olumiant with DMARDs from the 
indication and the indication only includes concomitant use with methotrexate.
There were trends supportive for improvement for patients with psoriasis, enthesis and axial 
spondyloarthritis, although these subgroups were smaller and between-group differences not always 
statistically significant. 
The results on time-to-flare in the randomised withdrawal phase appear to be stable across predefined 
subgroups, including JIA subtypes. In the subgroup of patients with polyarticular JIA, the proportion of 
patients with a flare was 51% (26/51) for placebo and 18% (10/57) for baricitinib (p<0.001). In the 
subgroup of patients with extended oligoarticular JIA, the proportion of patients with a flare was 71% 
(5/7) for placebo and 20% (1/5) for baricitinib (p=0.24). In the subgroup of patients with ERA, the 
proportion of patients with a flare was 50% (10/20) for placebo and 19% (3/16) for baricitinib 
(p=0.083). In the subgroup of patients with juvenile PsA, no patients flared in the placebo group (n=3) 
nor in the baricitinib group (n=4). Because of the low prevalence of JIA and its subtypes over age 
classes, it is expected to rely on extrapolation to some extent, as explained in the EMA Guideline on 
clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
(EMA/CHMP/239770/2014 Rev. 2). The CHMP considers that sufficient data are available for all JIA 
subtypes and age classes to extrapolate efficacy.
Over 1 – 2 years of treatment, it appears that in most patients, responses can be maintained without 
the occurrence of flares.
In conclusion, the CHMP considers that the efficacy of baricitinib is supported by the data submitted in 
the claimed indication: “Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis: Olumiant is indicated for the treatment of Juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis in patients 2 years of age and older who have had an inadequate response or 
intolerance to one or more prior conventional synthetic or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic 
drugs (DMARDs): Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular rheumatoid factor positive 
[RF+] or negative [RF-], extended oligoarticular), Enthesitis related arthritis, and Juvenile psoriatic 
arthritis. Baricitinib may be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate”
2.6.8.  Clinical safety
Safety data for the applied indication come from two studies on baricitinib-treated patients aged 2 to 
less than 18 years with non-systemic JIA:

2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure
A total of 220 patients was exposed to any dose of baricitinib in the JIA clinical trial program (Panel 
18). In the PK/Safety and OLLI period, the exposure was mean (SD) 12.4 (1.6) weeks of exposure and 
52.2 PY of exposure. In the PC DBW period 82 patients were exposed to baricitinib and 81 to placebo, 
with a mean (SD) exposure of 26.3 (sd 10.0) versus 18.9 (sd 12.3) weeks, and 41.4 PY versus 29.4 PY 
of exposure. In the placebo-controlled DBW period, the total exposure was approximately 40% higher 
in the baricitinib group than that in the placebo group due to more number of patients in the placebo 
group who flared and discontinued treatment (see Efficacy section).
Overall exposure in the All JIA safety analysis set was 325.7 PY; 171 patients were exposed to 
baricitinib for at least 52 weeks.

2.6.8.2.  Adverse events
Summary of adverse events
In the open-label periods, 57% of patients had at least one treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE), 
which in 4 cases (1.8%) was a severe adverse event (AE) and in 6 cases (2/7%) was a serious adverse 
event (SAE); two (0.9%) patients discontinued due to an AE (Panel 19).
In the placebo-controlled period, 47% (38/81) of patients in the placebo group had at least 1 TEAE, 
which was 66% (54/82) in the baricitinib group. Exposure to study treatment was larger in the 
baricitinib group (41 PY) as compared to the placebo group (29 PY). Most TEAEs were mild or

moderate in severity. In the placebo group, 2 patients (2.5%) had at least one severe AE and also 2 
patients in the baricitinib group. No deaths occurred; there were 3 patients (3.7%) in the placebo 
group and 4 patients (4.9%) in the baricitinib group with at least one SAE. Discontinuations due to AEs 
were infrequent in the placebo (n=2) and baricitinib (n=1) groups.
Panel 19 Overview of Adverse events in the study JAHV
Common adverse events
In the open-label periods (N=220), most TEAEs occurred in the SOCs of infections and infestations 
(25%), gastro-intestinal disorders (15%), investigations (12%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders (11%), nervous system disorders (8.2%), respiratory disorders (6.8%), skin and 
subcutaneous disorders (6.4%), blood and lymphatic system disorders (5.9%). In the open-label 
baricitinib treatment period, the most frequently occurring TEAEs were:


nausea n: 11 (5%)
upper respiratory tract infection n: 11 (5%)
(upper) abdominal pain, n=11 (5%)
vomiting n: 10 (4.5%)
In the placebo-controlled period, the occurrence of TEAEs in the placebo versus baricitinib groups 
differed for the SOCs of infections and infestations (19% versus 38%), investigations (2.5% versus 
17%), respiratory disorders (14% versus 17%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 
(9.9% versus 16%), gastro-intestinal disorders (6.2% versus 15%), nervous system disorders (4.9% 
versus 12%), skin and subcutaneous disorders (3.7% versus 8.5%). For the SOC blood and lymphatic 
system disorders the comparison of placebo versus baricitinib was (3.7% versus 4.9%). The most 
common TEAE’s by PT in baricitinib treated patients were: 



upper respiratory tract infection (n = 9; 11%, IR 22.9), 
headache (n = 9; 11%, IR 23.3), 
nasopharyngitis (n = 6, 7.3%, IR 15.3),


arthralgia (n = 6; 7.3%, IR 15), and
oropharyngeal pain (n = 5, 6.1%, IR 12.5). 
TEAE’s were mostly mild to moderate in severity; 2 severe events were reported in the baricitinib 
group (COVID-19 and PE), and 3 in the placebo group (bronchospasm, overdose, suicide attempt). 
Numerical differences of TEAEs between the baricitinib and placebo groups were detected for upper 
respiratory tract infection, oropharyngeal pain, and headache (Panel 20). 
Panel 20 Treatment emergent Adverse Events with a numerical imbalance, in the placebo controlled 
period of study JAHV
As clustered group of events, upper respiratory tract infections/oropharyngeal pain, abdominal pain, 
and rash, were more frequent in the baricitinib group (). The occurrence of upper respiratory tract 
infections/ oropharyngeal pain was 11% in the placebo group and 22% in the baricitinib group; 
abdominal pain occurred in 6.9% versus 17% in the placebo and baricitinib groups, rash occurred in 
3.4% (n=1) and in 10 % (n=4) of the placebo and baricitinib groups.

JAHV
In the All JIA safety analysis set (JAHV + JAHX), most (89%) of patients had at least 1 TEAE, while 
7.7% of patients has a severe TEAE and 10% had a SAE. In 9 patients (4.1%) baricitinib was stopped 
due to an AE. The most common TEAE’s by PT were:
•

COVID-19 (n = 43; 19.5%),
nasopharyngitis (n = 39; 17.7%),
headache (n = 33, 15%), 
upper respiratory tract infection (n = 29, 13.2%), and
arthralgia (n = 25, 11.4%).
Also, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (PT term), nausea and vomiting, (upper) abdominal pain, were 
relatively frequent (Panel 22). When analysed in clusters, upper respiratory tract 
infections/oropharyngeal pain (39%, IR=36.4/1PY), abdominal pain (10%, IR=7.3/1PY), and rash 
(6.8%, IR=4.9/1PY) were most frequent (Panel 23). Fractures occurred in 4.1% of patients with an IR 
(95%CI) of 2.8 (1.3-5.3).

Infections 
It is referred to the section below including adverse event of special interest (AESI)’s. 
Headache
In the placebo-controlled period, there were 3 (3.7%) cases of headache in the placebo group and 9 
(11%), IR: 23.3) in the baricitinib group. In the All JIA safety set, there were 33 (15%, IR: 11.3) 
patients with headache. One case of headache was a severe AE and one was an SAE, as it lead to 
hospitalisation. The case was also described in the section for SAEs.
Musculoskeletal
In the placebo-controlled period, in the placebo versus baricitinib groups, there were cases of 
arthralgia (3 versus 6), joint effusion (0 versus 1), joint swelling (2 versus 1), synovitis (0 versus 1), 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis ‘sic’ (2 versus 0). In the All JIA safety set, there were 25 (11%) patients 
with arthralgia, 22 (10%) with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (PT), 5 (2.3%) patients with arthritis, 4 
(1.8%) with joint swelling. Lower IRs of Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders were reported 
in the All JIA safety analysis set (n = 22, 10%, IR: 7.2) compared with the IR for baricitinib-treated 
patients in the PC DBW period (n = 13, 16%, IR: 15/PY). 
Gastro-intestinal 
Five patients reported TEAEs within the gastroenteritis cluster (IR: 1.5) in the All JIA safety set 
compared with 1 patient (IR: 2.4) in the baricitinib treatment group of the placebo-controlled period. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue
There were no anaphylactic reactions (narrow) reported in the JIA clinical trial programme, in the All 
JIA safety analysis set, 2 patients (0.9%, IR: 0.6) had an event within the Angioedema (narrow) SMQ.
A similar proportion of baricitinib (6.1%)- and placebo (4.9%)-treated patients reported TEAEs in the 
Hypersensitivity (narrow) SMQ in the PC DBW period and 11.4% (IR: 8.3) of patients reported such 
events in the All JIA safety analysis set.

The IR of rash as a cluster was higher in the baricitinib (IR: 9.8) than in the placebo treatment group 
(IR: 3.4) in the PC DBW period. IR of rash as a cluster was lower (4.9) in the All JIA safety analysis set 
compared with the IR in the baricitinib treatment group (9.8) in the placebo controlled period.
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events
Deaths
No deaths were reported in the JIA clinical trial programme through the data cutoff date 21 April 2022.
Serious adverse events
In the placebo-controlled period, 7 patients reported an SAE: 3 (3.7%, IR: 10.2) patients in the 
placebo treatment group had an SAE (Bronchospasm, Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Suicide attempt) 
and 4 (4.9%, IR: 9.7) patients in the baricitinib treatment group had an SAE (COVID-19, 
Gastroenteritis, Headache, and Pulmonary embolism). No SAEs were reported more than once either in 
the baricitinib or in the placebo treatment group (Panel 24).

Panel 24 Serious Adverse Events in the placebo-controlled period of study JAHV
In the All JIA safety set, 22 (10.0%) patients had ≥1 SAE (Panel 25). Most SAEs were reported in the 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders SOC (n = 9, 4.1%) with PTs of Arthralgia, Joint 
effusion, and Juvenile idiopathic arthritis accounting for a majority of events. SAEs reported by more 
than 1 patient were: Arthralgia, n = 2 (0.9%); Joint effusion, n = 2 (0.9%); Juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis, n = 2 (0.9%), but arthritis and joint destruction were also reported as SAE. The IR of patients 
presenting with at least 1 SAE in the All JIA safety analysis set was 7.1/100 PY and was 9.7/100PY in 
the baricitinib treatment group during the placebo-controlled period.

Other significant events
Infections
In the placebo-controlled period, infections were more frequent in the baricitinib group as compared to 
the placebo group (38% versus 19%); (Panel 26). The most commonly reported infections in the 
baricitinib treatment group were upper respiratory tract infections (n = 9, 11%, IR: 22.9), and 
nasopharyngitis (n = 6, 7.3%, IR: 15.3). None of the treatment emergent infections led to permanent 
baricitinib discontinuation. There was no tuberculosis reported in the study.
Serious infections were reported in 2 patients in the baricitinib treatment group and none in the 
placebo group: One of the baricitinib-treated patients was hospitalised due to an SAE of severe COVID-
19 infection, the other SAE was acute gastroenteritis with hospitalisation.

EMA/365746/2023 
Page 67/110
Panel 26 Occurrence of infections in the placebo-controlled period of study JAHV
In the All JIA safety set, 138 patients (62.7%) reported ≥1 TE infections with an IR of 75.8, compared 
to an IR of 102.1 in the baricitinib treatment group in the placebo-controlled period (Panel 27). Five 
patients (2.3%, IR: 1.5) had a serious infection (COVID-19, gastroenteritis, appendicitis, Bartholin’s 
abscess, and abscess soft tissue).
The IR (1.5) of serious infection in the All JIA safety analysis set was lower compared with the IR (4.9) 
in the baricitinib treatment group in the PC DBW period. None of the treatment emergent infections led 
to permanent baricitinib discontinuation, whereas 16% of patients temporarily interrupted study 
treatment due to the infection. There was no tuberculosis case reported in the JIA clinical trial 
programme. Forty-five patients (21%) had ≥1 TEAE within the Coronavirus infection (HLT); none of 
these patients permanently discontinued baricitinib and 16 patients temporarily interrupted baricitinib.
Panel 27 Occurrence of infections in the All JIA safety set (JAHV and JAHX)
In the All JIA safety period, Herpes zoster was reported in 4 patients (1.8%). All events were mild or 
moderate in severity, non-SAE, and 2 of them resolved within 2 weeks, all led to temporary baricitinib 
interruption. Three patients recovered and 1 event was ongoing at the time of data cutoff.
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 68/110
Herpes simplex occurred in 4 patients (1.8%), 2 patients had oral herpes, 1 had genital herpes and 1 
herpes virus infection (unspecified). All TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity, and all resolved. 
None led to permanent baricitinib discontinuation, and 3 events led to temporary interruption.
Opportunistic infections did not occur in the baricitinib treated groups during the placebo-controlled 
period or in the All JIA safety set. No events of detectable post-baseline Hepatitis B virus DNA were 
observed in the JIA clinical trial programme.
MACE and VTE
There was no positively adjudicated MACE or arterial thrombotic event reported in the JIA clinical trial 
programme. One patient had developed pulmonary embolism (PE) while on baricitinib.
 Pulmonary embolism was reported (Study Day 162) in an adolescent patient. PE was positively 
adjudicated by an external adjudication committee. The patient was hospitalised and discontinued 
baricitinib due to PE. Two days after hospitalisation, the patient received antibiotics for suspected 
pneumonia. Platelet counts were elevated at baseline (500 × 109/L) and at the time of the event 
(Study Day 147: 464 ×109/L, Study Day 176: 603 × 109/L). Approximately 1 month after 
baricitinib discontinuation, platelet counts returned to normal level (Study Day 195: 342 × 109/L). 
The patient had multiple risk factors for PE. It was reported by the investigator that the patient 
had stayed in bed for several weeks before the PE event. Positive RF and ACPA, the failure of two 
prior biological treatments and the high inflammation indices were identified as poor prognostic 
factors of JIA. The patient recovered from the event.
Platelet counts
Increases in platelet counts did occur. In the placebo-controlled period, 9 patients (30%) in the 
baricitinib treatment group and 1 patient (8.3%) in the placebo treatment group had platelet shifts to 
>400 × 109/L. Mean increase from baseline to final post-baseline value for platelets was higher in the 
baricitinib treatment group (12.1 × 109/L) compared with the placebo treatment group (-11.5 × 
109/L). In the All JIA safety analysis set, 53 patients (33.1%) had platelet shifts to >400 × 109/L, and 
10 patients (4.8%) had platelet shifts to >600 × 109/L.
Malignancy and NMSC
There was no malignancy reported in the JIA clinical trial programme.
Hepatic function
In the placebo-controlled period, 1 patient in the baricitinib treatment group had ALT increase to ≥5× 
ULN, and no patient had AST increase to ≥3× ULN. Baricitinib was not interrupted, ALT decreased to 
normal level within 4 weeks and stayed within the normal range afterwards. Before 
hypertransaminasaemia was reported, the patient received measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine 
(Study Day 173) and influenza vaccine (Study Day 270). Three patients (7.9%) had elevations of ALP 
≥1.5× ULN in the baricitinib treatment group, compared with none in the placebo treatment group.
In the All JIA safety analysis set, 9 patients (4.1%) had ALT ≥3× ULN, 6 patients (2.7%) ALT ≥5× 
ULN, and 1 (0.5%) patient had ALT ≥10× ULN (Panel 28). Three patients (1.4%) were observed with 
AST ≥3× ULN and 2 (0.9%) with AST ≥5× ULN. All 3 patients observed with AST≥3× ULN recovered 
without interrupting baricitinib. The patients with larger changes all recovered, with or without 
interrupting baricitinib. Nine patients (4.1%) had increased ALP to ≥1.5× ULN in the All JIA safety 
analysis set.
In the All JIA data set, one case of hepatic cytolysis occurred that was not considered related to 
treatment by the investigator. Also, in the All JIA analysis set, it appeared that a second patient had 
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 69/110
Hepatic cytolysis, 3 patients reported Hepatic steatosis, 1 patient reported Liver injury; all patients 
were reported as recovered. There were no patients meeting Hy’s law criteria.
 An adolescent patient was observed with ALT ≥3×ULN and AST increase (ALT: 130 U/L, AST: 50 
U/L, CPK: normal) (Study Day 511) without any clinical symptoms and was hospitalised for 
monitoring and investigation of the causes of liver test abnormalities. Concomitant medication 
included MTX, prednisolone, and ciclopirox. In the hospital, he was diagnosed with hepatic 
cytolysis (peak ALT: 297 U/L (11.5× ULN) based on hospital local laboratory result). Hepatic 
cytolysis TEAE was considered severe (Study Day 511), and due to hospitalisation event, was 
reported as an SAE. Baricitinib was not interrupted, and the patient recovered. ALT and AST levels 
returned to normal levels (Study Day 594). Based on PI opinion, MTX association could be 
suspected. Based on internal medical review - due to AST and ALT levels returned to normal 
levels, the patient recovered without baricitinib interruption (patient received baricitinib for longer 
period of time), concomitant medications included MTX - this case was assessed as unlikely 
related to baricitinib.
 A pre-adolescent patient had ALT elevation of 14× ULN (ALT: 437 U/L, normal range: 5 to 30 U/L) 
and AST elevation of 6× ULN (AST:220 U/L, normal range: 0 to 36 U/L) (ALP: 357 U/L, normal 
range: 0 to 186 U/L, TBL level: normal) (Study Day 28) and reported a non-serious TEAE of 
moderate liver injury (Study Day 28) with right upper quadrant abdominal pain. The patient met 
permanent discontinuation criteria due to hepatic enzyme increases and discontinued baricitinib 
(Study Day 31). One week before the hepatic event, mild upper respiratory tract infection was 
reported. After discontinuation of NSAID, MTX (7.5 mg/week) and baricitinib, hepatic enzymes 
decreased to normal or near normal levels (ALT: 33 U/L, Study Day 54) (AST and ALP normal 
[Study Day 54]), and the patient recovered. This case was assessed by the sponsor as possibly 
related to baricitinib.

In the All JIA safety set, the population’s relative height was consistent over time with a reduced 
median height when compared with other children of their age (Figure 8). The height percentile of 
patients relative to healthy children of the same age in the All JIA safety analysis set was similar at 
Week 52 to that observed at baseline, indicating a growth velocity consistent with their healthy peers.

There were no reported abnormalities in knee x-rays or MRIs. For patients with growth potential (that 
is, those <18 years of age), patients (n = 18) demonstrated increased tibial length proportional to 
increases in height across the assessment period. Occipital frontal circumference measurement was a 
requirement in 2-year-old patients. There were two 2-year-old patients enrolled in the All JIA safety 
analysis set. However, no occipital circumference measurement raw data were collected.

Fractures
In the All JIA safety set, 9 patients had a TEAE within the “Fracture cluster” (4.1%, IR: 2.8). Of those, 
7 patients reported a PT specific to Fracture, and 2 patients reported a PT of Joint injury (1 with left 
ankle injury and the other with left elbow injury due to fall). 
All fractures were upper extremities fractures (n = 4) or lower extremities fractures (n = 3). One 
fracture was confirmed as a sport injury (skateboarding). There were no patients with recurrent 
fractures during the study.
Most fractures were considered mild or moderate in severity. One fracture TEAE was severe and also 
serious due to hospitalisation (Fracture displacement PT). No patient permanently discontinued study 
drug due to fracture. All patients recovered.
Time to onset of fracture ranged from 86 to 582 days since baricitinib treatment started, and events 
were spread over time. There was no accumulation of fractures with longer baricitinib exposure. All 
patients with fractures were 12 to 15 years of age at the time of the event (3 male and 4 female 
patients). This is in line with literature data that show that nearly 50% of healthy children sustain at 
least 1 fracture by the age of 18 years and that incidence peaks during early adolescence, shortly after 
the pubertal growth spurt (Wasserman and Gordan 2017).
Six of the 7 patients (86%) who reported a fracture had corticosteroid use prior to study entry, and 
out of these 6 patients, 2 had concomitant corticosteroid use at the time of the fracture. In Study 
JAHV, the mean BMI at baseline for the total population was 20.3 kg/m2, and 38.6% of patients were 
underweight (≤18.5 kg/m2). Of the 7 patients with a fracture, 2 were underweight (≤18.5 kg/m2) at 
baseline.
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings
Response to vaccination
The number of patients receiving booster doses of tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis vaccine 
and/or pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was minimal (n = 6). The majority of patients who received 
booster doses had detectible antibody titre levels at 12 weeks.
Blood lipids
The classification of lipid values differs between the adult and the paediatric population. Categorical 
analyses were performed using Expert Panel on Integrated Guidelines for Cardiovascular Health and 
Risk Reduction in Children and Adolescents (2011). 
In the placebo-controlled period, among the patients who had an “acceptable” total cholesterol level at 
baseline, 14 patients (21.9%) in the baricitinib treatment group and 4 patients (6.8%) in the placebo 
treatment group increased to “borderline high”, and 3 patients (4.7%) in the baricitinib treatment 
group and 3 patients (5.1%) in the placebo group increased to “high”. Among the patients who had an 
“acceptable” triglyceride level at baseline, 7 patients (15.2%) in the baricitinib treatment group and 9 
patients (17.3%) in the placebo treatment group increased to “borderline high” and 2 patients (4.3%) 
in the baricitinib and 6 patients in the placebo treatment group (11.5%) increased to “high” in this 
period. For LDL en HDL, no between-group differences were apparent (Panel 29).
In the All JIA safety analysis set, overall, 15% of patients experienced categorical increase (according 
to NCEP criteria) to high cholesterol, 9.3% increased to high LDL-cholesterol, and 11% decreased to 
low HDL cholesterol. Overall, 23.8% of patients experienced a categorical increase (according to NCEP 
criteria) to high triglyceride levels.

Creatine phosphokinase
In the placebo-controlled period, 13 patients (23.6%) had any CTCAE grade increase in CPK (reflecting 
an increase in CPK) in the baricitinib treatment group and 7 patients (25%) in the placebo treatment 
group. Most increases were to Grade 1 or 2, 3 patients had increases to Grade ≥3, 1 in the baricitinib 
treatment group and 2 in the placebo treatment group (Grade 4). In the baricitinib treatment group 1 
patient (1.2%) reported muscle spasm (PT) but the patient had no elevated CPK levels at the time of 
the reported muscle symptoms.
In the All JIA safety analysis set, 47 patients (33.8%) had any CTCAE grade increase of CPK (Panel 
30). Nine patients (4.1%) had CTCAE grade increase to Grade ≥3 and of those patients, 3 patients 
(1.4%) had an increase to Grade ≥4. No additional muscle symptom AEs were reported.

Haematology
In the placebo-controlled period, 11 patients (28%) had any CTCAE grade increase of haemoglobin 
(reflecting a decrease in haemoglobin) in the baricitinib treatment group and 8 patients (22%) in the 
placebo group (Panel 31). Mean change from baseline to final post-baseline value for haemoglobin was 
0.148 mmol/L-Fe in the baricitinib treatment group, compared with -0.041 mmol/L-Fe in the placebo 
group. Treatment emergent events of low haemoglobin and low haematocrit were observed for 9 
(17%) and 7 (10%) patients in the baricitinib treatment group and for 6 (12%) and 7 (11%) patients 
in the placebo group. In the All JIA safety analysis set, 51 patients (23%) had any CTCAE grade 
increase of haemoglobin (reflecting a decrease in haemoglobin). All increases were to Grade 1 or 2, no 
increases to Grade ≥3 was observed. Treatment emergent cases of low haemoglobin and low 
haematocrit were observed for 43 (28%) and 43 (24%) of patients while on baricitinib. Seven patients 
(3.2%, IR: 2.2) reported TEAEs of anaemia, 3 patients (1.4%, IR: 0.9) reported iron deficiency 
anaemia and 1 reported microcytic anaemia (0.5%, IR: 0.3). None of the anaemia events were 
reported as severe TEAE or SAE. No patient permanently discontinued or temporarily interrupted 
baricitinib due to an event of anaemia.
In the placebo-controlled period (Panel 31), 10 patients (24%) had any CTCAE grade increase in 
neutrophils (reflecting a decrease in neutrophil counts) in the baricitinib treatment group and 6 
patients (21%) in the placebo group. No patient had an increase to Grade 4 or higher in the baricitinib 
treatment group. Mean decrease from baseline to final post-baseline value for neutrophil counts was 
higher (-1.041 × 109/L) in the baricitinib treatment group compared with placebo (0.007 × 109/L). In 
the All JIA safety analysis set, 60 patients (27%) had any CTCAE grade increase in neutrophils 
(reflecting a decrease in neutrophil counts) in the All JIA safety analysis set. The patient with observed 
with CTCAE grade 4 was observed with low absolute and segmented neutrophil count (Study Day 159). 
Baricitinib was interrupted first for 6 days (Study Day 143), then for 9 days (Study Day 160). 
Baricitinib was resumed (Study Day169), neutrophil count returned to normal level (Study Day 234). 
In the placebo-controlled period (Panel 31), 10 patients (18%) had any CTCAE grade increase in 
lymphocytes (reflecting a decrease in lymphocyte counts) in the baricitinib treatment group and four 
patients (6.7%) in the placebo group. In the baricitinib treatment group, no patient had increase to 
Grade ≥3. Mean change from baseline to final post-baseline value for lymphocytes was small, -0.073 ×

109/L in the baricitinib treatment group and -0.16 × 109/L in the placebo treatment group. In the All 
JIA safety analysis set, 42 patients (19%) had any CTCAE grade increase in lymphocytes (reflecting a 
decrease in lymphocyte counts. Most CTCAE increases were to Grade 1 or 2, 2 patients (0.9%) had 
increase to Grade 3, and no patient had an increase to Grade 4.

2.6.8.5.  Safety in special populations
The frequencies and IRs of TEAEs were similar across age groups except for the youngest group of 
patients (aged ≥2 to <6 years). The TEAEs in the youngest age group were:






A 2-year-old female with mild anaemia.
A 3-year-old female with mild events of: nasopharyngitis, herpangina, upper respiratory tract 
infection, bronchitis, nasopharyngitis, and nail injury.
A 5-year-old male who reported mild Pharyngitis.
A 5-year-old female who reported mild Respiratory tract infection. Seven months later, the 
patient reported moderate transaminasaemia that was described as resolving. Concomitantly, 
the patient reported mild COVID-19.
A 2-year-old female who reported mild Respiratory tract infection and 8 months later reported 
mild transient neutropenia.
A 5-year-old female who reported mild throat infection and 4 months later reported mild ankle 
pain.
Overall, most TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity in all age groups, and a few patients 
permanently discontinued baricitinib due to AEs across all groups while no patients discontinued in the 
age group ≥2 to <6 years (Panel 32). No SAEs were reported in the youngest age group (≥2 to <6 
years) and the frequency of SAEs was similar across the other age groups. No deaths have been 
reported.

Panel 32 Overview of AEs by age group in the All JIA safety set (JAHV and JAHX)
Serious infections have only been reported in patients aged≥9 years: 1 infection-related SAE was 
reported in 1 patient in the group aged ≥9 to <12 years (3.3%, IR: 2.8), and 4 infection-related SAEs 
were reported in 4 patients in the group aged 12 to <18 years (2.3%, IR: 1.5).
Female and male
Out of 220 patients there were 68 (30.9%) male patients and 152 (69.1%) female patients. The 
number of patients with at least one TEAE was 82% among females and 77% among males. The 
number of patients with infections was 58% among females and 47% among males. Urinary tract 
infection was reported in 9 (5.9%) female patients and for 1 (1.5%) male patient.
Weight class
Out of 220 patients there were 29 (13.2%) patients with a weight of <30 kg, and 191 (86.8%) 
patients with a weight of ≥30 kg (Panel 33). A similar proportion of patients weighing ≥30 kg as 
compared with patients weighing <30 kg had TEAEs (83% versus 80%) and events in the Infections 
and infestations SOC (52% versus 55%). Twenty-one SAEs were reported in patients who weighed 
≥30 Kg, and 1 SAE was reported in children who weighed <30 kg.

Panel 33 Serious Adverse Events by weight class in the All JIA safety set (JAHV and JAHX)
There were 138 patients with TE infections in the All JIA safety analysis set (Panel 34). Similar 
proportion of patients weighing ≥30 kg reported at least 1 infection-related TE compared with patients 
weighing <30 kg. All serious infections and Herpes zoster were reported in the patient group who 
weighed ≥30 kg. No confirmed OI was reported in any groups.

2.6.8.6.  Discontinuation due to adverse events
Permanent discontinuation
In the All JIA safety analysis set, 9 patients (4.1%, IR: 2.8) had an AE that led to permanent study 
drug discontinuation. Two events (Bronchospasm and Pulmonary embolism already discussed above in 
the case descriptions) were reported as SAEs. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (PT) was reported by 2 
patients as leading to permanent study drug discontinuation (Panel 35). All other AE PTs and all SAE 
PTs resulting in discontinuation of baricitinib were single events, these included neutropenia, asthma, 
psoriasis, and liver injury.

Panel 35 Adverse events leading to permanent discontinuation of baricitinib in the All JIA safety data 
set
Temporary discontinuation
In the placebo-controlled period, temporary interruptions occurred in 4 (4.9%) patients in the placebo 
group (all due to infections) and in 6 (7.3%) patients in the baricitinib group (4 infections, 
lymphopenia, neutropenia, gastritis and hypertransaminaseamia). 
In the All JIA safety set, 57 patients (26%) interrupted baricitinib treatment due to AEs at least once 
(IR: 20.3/100PY), and 98.2% of patients resumed baricitinib following a temporary interruption. 
Events in the Infections and infestations SOC (n = 35, 15.9%, IR: 11.6) were responsible for most of 
the temporary interruptions of baricitinib.
2.6.8.7.  Post marketing experience
Baricitinib was first authorised on 13 February 2017 in the EU for the treatment of moderately to 
severely active RA in adult patients. As of February 2022, baricitinib had been authorised in 76 
countries for the treatment of moderately to severely active RA in adult patients, including EU. The 
PSUR 10 (DLP on 13 February 2022) is the latest PSUR available at the time of the DLP for this JIA 
extension of indication application.
Prompted by the available data from the ORAL Surveillance study (tofacitinib) and from Study B023 
(baricitinib), on 11 February 2022, European Medicines Agency (EMA) ’s safety committee, 
Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC), started a review of the safety of JAK inhibitors 
used to treat several chronic inflammatory disorders (RA, psoriatic arthritis, JIA, ankylosing spondylitis, 
ulcerative colitis, AD, and alopecia areata). Olumiant was part of the products reviewed in the referral.  
On 23 January 2023, CHMP endorsed the measures recommended by the PRAC to minimise the risk of 
serious side effects with JAK inhibitors used to treat several chronic inflammatory disorders. These side 
effects include cardiovascular conditions, blood clots, cancer and serious infections.

Off-label use in children or adolescents is minimal based on the very few safety reports for paediatric 
patients (n = 4, reporting rate of 0.006 per 100 PY during the latest PSUR-PBRER 10 interval), and the 
most recent analysis from Study I4V-MC-B016 in the UK (as of February 2022), indicating that 0.76% 
of the patients (n = 11 of 1444 patients) were less than 18 years of age.
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety
Clinical studies
A randomised withdrawal design with an open-label lead-in period is an acceptable design for 
evaluating efficacy and safety in children, given that it can be extrapolated from the experience in 
adults. 
Exposure
A total of 220 patients was exposed to any dose of baricitinib in the JIA clinical trial program; 171 
patients were exposed to baricitinib for at least 52 weeks. Although there is a relatively large number 
of patients included and over 100 patients were exposed for at least one year, the safety experience in 
the youngest age group between 2 and 6 and between 6 and 9 years is limited. Most patients were 
aged between 9 - 12 (n=30, 14%) and between 12 - 18 (n=175, 80%) years old; only a few patients 
were between 2 – 6 (n=6) and between 6 – 9 (n=9) years old (see section ‘Special populations’ further 
below). Out of 220 patients there were 29 (13%) patients with a weight of <30 kg, and 191 (87%) 
patients with a weight of ≥30 kg. Please, note that the posology proposed for the SmPC is weight-
based rather than age-based.
Common adverse events
Seen over the open-label as well as the randomised withdrawal periods, the most frequently occurring 
TEAEs were generally in line with the ADRs known for baricitinib. Upper respiratory tract infection, 
oropharyngeal pain, headache, abdominal pain and rash were more common when on baricitinib than if 
on placebo. 
In the 12-week open-label period, most (57%) patients had at least 1 TEAE, and in the withdrawal 
phase, the proportion of patients with at least 1 TEAE was larger in the baricitinib group as compared 
to the placebo group (66% versus 47%). The occurrence of severe and serious AEs and of 
discontinuations due to AEs was low. In the open-label periods, 57% of patients had at least one TEAE, 
which in 4 cases (1.8%) was a severe AE and in 6 cases (2/7%) was a SAE; two (0.9%) patients 
discontinued due to an AE. In the placebo-controlled period, 47% (38/81) of patients in the placebo 
group had at least 1 TEAE, which was 66% (54/82) in the baricitinib group. In the placebo group, 2 
patients (2.5%) had at least one severe AE and also 2 patients in the baricitinib group. No deaths 
occurred; there were 3 patients (3.7%) in the placebo group and 4 patients (4.9%) in the baricitinib 
group with at least one SAE. Discontinuations due to AEs were infrequent in the placebo (n=2) and 
baricitinib (n=1) groups. In the All JIA safety set using all available follow-up data, the most common 
TEAEs were similar to those already seen in the JAHV trial periods. Also, cases of herpes simplex (n=4, 
1.8%) and herpes zoster (n=4, 1.8%), gastroenteritis (n=5, 2.3%), and acne (n=9, 4.1%) started to 
emerge. Therefore, when analysing all available safety data, the occurrence and pattern of AEs is in 
line with the known safety profile (ADRs) of baricitinib, including cases of herpes simplex and herpes 
zoster, gastroenteritis and acne. The frequent occurrence of TEAEs that also are manifestations of JIA 
(arthralgia, synovitis, etc.), are valued as related to the disease activity, not as potential ADR of 
baricitinib. Musculoskeletal manifestations not attributable to JIA did not point to a disbalance, and 
neither did so in placebo-controlled trials in AA and AD. It also is considered that in general, drop-out 
due to flare is a competing outcome for the occurrence of (mild to moderate) manifestations of JIA 
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 80/110
over time. This may explain a seemingly higher occurrence of JIA manifestations in the baricitinib 
treated group, as compared to placebo. 
Upper respiratory tract infections, herpes zoster and herpes simplex, gastroenteritis, urinary tract 
infections, pneumonia, folliculitis, swelling of the face and urticaria, headache, DVT and PE, nausea, 
abdominal pain and diverticulitis, rash and acne, weight increased, are known clinical (non-laboratory) 
ADRs of baricitinib. For the SmPC, the Applicant does not propose to add new ADRs, which can be 
agreed upon. The Applicant proposes to adapt frequencies based on the withdrawal period of the 
pivotal trial: headache was very common (11 %), neutropenia < 1 000 cells/mm3 was common (2.4 
%), and pulmonary embolism was common (1.2 %), which was acceptable to CHMP.
Serious adverse events
Several patients had SAEs while being treated with baricitinib, but not all cases are attributable to 
baricitinib. The SAEs of infections (5), gastroenteritis, headache and pulmonary embolism are known 
ADRs of baricitinib; all patients involved recovered upon discontinuation of baricitinib. The other cases, 
including the SAE of hepatic cytolysis and SAEs of arthralgia and synovitis etc., are considered 
unrelated. The case of PE is peculiar, due to the patient's young age. It is acknowledged that the 
patient had multiple risk factors in developing PE, despite young age, though it cannot be excluded 
that baricitinib contributed to its causation. Because it cannot be excluded that baricitinib contributed 
to its causation, CHMP endorses mentioning the case in section 4.8 of the SmPC.
In the All JIA safety set, 22 (10%) patients had ≥1 SAE, and most (n=9) SAEs were reported in the 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders SOC (arthralgia, joint effusion, juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis, other manifestations). As discussed further above, it is considered that the occurrence of JIA 
manifestations are not to be regarded as ADRs of baricitinib. 
Adverse events of special interest
AESI’s that were considered for this report were: infections, MACE, VTE, and malignancies, in line with 
the concerns that gave rise to the Art. 20 JAK referral, and growth and fractures following concerns 
about a possible effect of JAK inhibition on bone metabolism. Response to vaccination is of interest to 
the paediatric population; it is recommended to bring all vaccinations up to date before starting 
baricitinib. The addition of the recommendation to bring all vaccinations up to date before starting 
baricitinib is reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC and in the additional risk minimisation measure 
materials in Annex II and Part V of the RMP.
Infections were a frequent AE and were more common in the baricitinib group as compared to placebo; 
serious infections did infrequently occur. Herpes zoster and herpes simplex occurred in some patients, 
but opportunistic infections did not occur. All infections and serious infections resolved, and in many 
cases and in all serious cases, baricitinib was temporarily interrupted. Infections are a known ADR of 
baricitinib but appeared to be manageable in the paediatric population. Younger children may be more 
liable to infection, and this is discussed in the section ‘Special populations’ further below.
There was no positively adjudicated MACE or arterial thrombotic event reported in the JIA clinical trial 
programme. One patient had developed PE while on baricitinib, which is discussed in the section on 
SAEs. The patient had a platelet level >ULN before the event, and platelet levels reduced to a normal 
level about 30 days after discontinuing baricitinib. About one-third of patients on baricitinib had 
platelet levels >400 × 109/L. There was no malignancy reported in the JIA clinical trial programme.
Fractures did occur in 7 patients on baricitinib, commonly distal fractures. There was no difference 
between baricitinib and placebo, but the sample size and exposure length is limited for a good 
comparison of fracture occurrence. The observed IR of fracture for the All JIA safety analysis set is 
within the range of the general childhood population (IR: 1.2 to 3.6 per 100 PY). Additionally, all 
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 81/110
patients who reported a fracture were 12 to 15 years of age at the time of event, which is a ‘peak age’ 
for fractures. The distribution of upper and lower extremity fractures is in line with what can be 
expected in the healthy population (Burnham et al. 2006). Considering that patients with JIA are at an 
approximate 3-fold increased risk of fracture compared to a similar aged non-JIA population (Burnham 
et al 2006), the observed IR is lower than what could be expected in children with JIA for this age 
group. Based on the average z-scores and graphical displays of growth over time, there is no indication 
of abnormal growth on a group level. The non-clinical data in juvenile rats showed an effect on bone 
metabolism in juvenile rats, though at doses above clinical exposure. However, data with longer follow-
up time are needed to evaluate growth and skeletal development against reference standards, long-
term safety study JAHX was added to the RMP. Bone fractures in baricitinib-treated patients will be 
monitored through routine surveillance practice.
Laboratory findings
The analysis of laboratory values confirms that known ADRs of baricitinib may also occur in the 
paediatric population; it is considered that, based on the current data, for the paediatric population, 
there are no additional ADRs in laboratory values.
The developments of blood lipids in paediatric patients basically followed the pattern seen in adults; 
mean increases in total cholesterol, LDL- and HDL cholesterol were higher in the baricitinib group, as 
compared to the placebo group. CPK increase to more than 5 x ULN is an ADR for baricitinib. In the 
placebo-controlled period, increases in CPK were as common in the baricitinib group as in the placebo 
group, large increases were uncommon and there were no patients with related muscle 
symptoms/myalgia. Thrombocytosis > 600 x 109 cells/L and neutropenia < 1 x 109 cells/L are ADRs of 
baricitinib. In the placebo-controlled period, a grade≥3 increase in ANC occurred in 1 patient on 
baricitinib; platelets increase was more frequent on baricitinib for increases <600 x 109/L. ALT and AST 
levels increase 3 or more times the ULN are recognised as ADRs for baricitinib. Increases in liver 
enzymes were infrequent in the placebo-controlled period, and all cases recovered in the All JIA data 
set. All 6 patients with hepatic events used other medications with possible hepatotoxic effects, such 
as MTX and/or NSAIDs. For both patients with hepatic cytolysis, ALT and AST returned to normal levels 
without baricitinib interruption, and both recovered. 
The number of patients receiving booster vaccinations of tetanus, diphtheria, and acellular pertussis 
vaccine and/or pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was minimal (n = 6), no conclusions can be made.
Subgroups
No important differences in the occurrence of AEs appeared between females and males. In the clinical 
development program, the posology was age based: patients <9 years old received 2 mg and patients 
≥9 years received 4 mg. The posology proposed in the SmPC however is weight based: patients <30 
kg will receive 2 mg and patients ≥30 kg will receive 4 mg. It however appears that for both weight-
categories, the lower weight patients will have relatively high exposures (see Pharmacokinetics 
discussion). According to the available data, it does not seem that patients <30 kg are at an increased 
risk for adverse events, as compared to heavier patients. However, data in patients <12 years old and 
<30 kg are limited in number. Therefore, safety follow-up study JAHX in paediatric patients with JIA 
was included in the RMP. The MAH will include safety analyses of patients <12 years of age and 10 to 
<20 and 20 to <30 kg weight subgroups. 
Discontinuations
Permanent discontinuation and temporary discontinuation of baricitinib was infrequent, usually 
associated with events that are known as ADR.
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 82/110
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety
Based on the available data, the safety profile of baricitinib in the doses of 1mg, 2 mg and 4 mg is 
acceptable in the paediatric population of patients with JIA. In the lower age (<9 years) and weight 
(<30 kg) categories, the number of patients is low, and in patients <20 kg the exposure is higher than 
in adults. Long-term safety in these groups will be followed post-marketing as reflected by the updated 
protocol of Study I4V-MC-JAHX as a Category 3 PASS of the RMP. From the non-clinical and available 
clinical data, there do not appear to be risks regarding bone safety, skeletal development or growth, 
but more data should be collected over a longer follow-up time in the post-marketing setting. 
Responses to vaccination is of interest for the paediatric population. Therefore, the RMP is updated 
include “Long-term safety in pediatric patients including growth and bone development, maturation 
and pubertal development and adverse response to vaccination” as missing information in the list of 
safety concerns. The addition of the recommendation to bring all vaccinations up to date before 
starting baricitinib is reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC and in the additional risk minimisation 
measure materials in Annex II and the RMP.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context
The proposed indication for baricitinib is: ‘for the treatment of active juvenile idiopathic arthritis in 
patients 2 years of age and older who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more 
prior conventional synthetic or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs):
- Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular rheumatoid factor positive [RF+] or negative 
[RF-], extended oligoarticular),
- Enthesitis related arthritis, and
- Juvenile psoriatic arthritis.
Baricitinib may be used as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate.’
The proposed dose of baricitinib is “4 mg once daily for patients weighing 30 kg or greater. For 
patients weighing less than 30 kg, the recommended dose is 2 mg once daily. The dose should be 
reduced by half for patients with renal dysfunction or who use strong OAT3 inhibitors.”

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a heterogeneous group of diseases characterised by arthritis of 
unknown origin with onset before age of 16 years, persisting for more than 6 weeks. The currently 
used ILAR classification distinguishes the following JIA categories: systemic arthritis, polyarthritis 
rheumatoid factor (RF) negative, polyarthritis RF positive, oligoarthritis, psoriatic arthritis, enthesitis-
related and undifferentiated arthritis. 
The subcategories of JIA in the proposed indication follow the ILAR categories, which is in line with the 
EMA Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis (EMA/CHMP/239770/2014 Rev. 2). 
Baricitinib is a JAK1/JAK2 inhibitor demonstrating selectivity for and inhibition of JAK1 and JAK2 with 
lower potency towards inhibition of JAK3 or TYK2 (Fridman et al. 2010). Inflammatory cytokines, such 
as IL-6, which transduces cell signalling through the JAK/STAT pathway (Rawlings et al. 2004), and 
TNF, whose expression is reduced by inhibition of JAK1 and JAK2, are considered to be associated with 
the pathology of JIA (Ravelli and Martini 2007).
The aim of treatment of JIA is rapid suppression of inflammation, prevent occurrence of flares, reduce 
pain and maximise physical function, and promote normal growth and development. The ultimate 
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 99/110
treatment goal is induction of clinical remission or attainment of minimal disease activity or inactive 
disease.
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are considered a first–line treatment option in most 
cases of newly diagnosed JIA, followed by intra-articular glucocorticosteroids and conventional disease 
modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), including methotrexate and sulfasalazine. However, a 
substantial proportion of patients do not achieve an adequate response to these therapies (Ringold et 
al. 2013; Hinze et al. 2015; Ravelli 2016). Biologic agents approved for RA in the last decades have 
been added to the treatments available to children with JIA (Lovell et al. 2000; Ruperto et al. 2010b; 
Brunner et al. 2015). These treatments include TNF-inhibitors (adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab), 
tocilizumab, secukinumab, abatacept. The only JAK-inhibitor approved for JIA up to now is tofacitinib.
Although the biological treatments have led to clinical improvements, many patients do not respond 
and do not achieve long-lasting remission (Hinze et al. 2015; Onel et al. 2022). There still is a medical 
need for effective and safe treatments for the different forms of JIA.
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies
The baricitinib clinical development programme for JIA includes one pivotal Phase 3 study (IV-MC-
JAHV) and 1 supportive long-term extension study (IV-MC-JAHX); the long-term extension study is still 
ongoing. Dosing for JIA was based on PK/PD modelling of data in RA; the intended doses of 4 mg and 
2 mg, based on body weight, were tested in the PK phase of the pivotal study JAHV. As half doses are 
needed for patients with decreased renal function or using strong OAT3 inhibitors, the Applicant 
submitted a grouping line extension application to introduce the 1 mg tablet.
Study JAHV is a double-blind, randomised (1:1) withdrawal, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the 
safety, efficacy, pharmacokinetics, acceptability, and palatability of baricitinib and the ability to mount 
primary and secondary immune response during baricitinib treatment in children from 2 years to less 
than 18 years of age with JIA. Included were patients with polyarticular JIA (n=143), extended 
oligoarticular JIA (n=16), ERA (n=50), and juvenile PsA (n=10). There were n=6 patients between 2-6 
years, n=9 between 6-9 years, n=30 between 9-12 years, and n=175 between 12-18 years of age. To 
confirm or adapt the intended dose, 5-8 patients per age cohort were included in a 2-week PK phase. 
Next, the study proceeded with the intended doses with a 12-week open-label phase, after which 
responders (>30% response in PedACR) were randomised to placebo or continuation with baricitinib 
for up to 32 weeks. In this double-blind phase, the primary outcome was time-to-flare (worsening of ≥
30% in at least 3 of the 6 PedACR core criteria for JIA and an improvement of ≥30% in no more than 1 
of the criteria). Patients having a flare were considered drop-out and could continue in the ongoing 
long-term follow-up study JAHX, with open-label treatment with baricitinib.
3.2.  Favourable effects
In the open-label period of study JAHV, a total of 167 (76%) patients reached a PedACR30 response at 
Week 12. The proportion of patients with a PedACR50 response was 64%, with PedACR70 was 46%, 
with PedACR90 response was 20%, and a PedACR100 response was reached in 10%. Decreases were 
also seen in the 6 PedACR components, including CHAQ disability, and in CHAQ Pain, JADAS-27 score, 
amongst others.
The primary outcome of the pivotal study JAHV was met. During the randomised withdrawal part of the 
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 100/110
trial, patients receiving baricitinib were significantly less likely to experience disease flare when 
compared with those receiving placebo (hazard ratio = 0.241, p-value: <.001). By the end of the 
withdrawal period at week 44, 14 (17%) patients receiving baricitinib had a disease flare as compared 
to 41 (51%) patients receiving placebo. The survival curves of time-to-flare clearly separated the 
placebo group from the baricitinib group.
The treatment effect in time-to-flare was present in three of the included JIA subtypes, but not in the 
small (n=7) juvenile PsA group where no flares occurred. 
-
In the subgroup of patients with polyarticular JIA, the proportion of patients with a flare was 
51% (26/51) for placebo and 18% (10/57) for baricitinib (p<0.001). 
-
In the subgroup of patients with extended oligoarticular JIA, the proportion of patients with a 
flare was 71% (5/7) for placebo and 20% (1/5) for baricitinib (p=0.24). 
-
In the subgroup of patients with ERA, the proportion of patients with a flare was 50% (10/20) 
for placebo and 19% (3/16) for baricitinib (p=0.083). 
-
In the subgroup of patients with juvenile PsA, no patients flared in the placebo group (n=3) 
nor in the baricitinib group (n=4).
A total of 67% of patients receiving baricitinib, and 38% of patients receiving placebo reached a 
PedACR30 response (p<.001), while 63% of patients receiving baricitinib, and 37% of patients 
receiving placebo reached a PedACR50 response (p=0.002). The improvements in the 6 components of 
the PedACR response criteria were all numerically larger in the baricitinib group, as compared to the 
placebo group (not tested for significance).
At week 44, there were 11 (14%) patients with inactive disease in the placebo group and 19 (23%) in 
the baricitinib group (p=0.11). At week 44, the mean (SE) change in JADAS-27 was -9.9 (1.0) in the 
placebo group and -14.2 (1.0) in the baricitinib group (p=0.001). At week 44, the mean (SE) change 
in CHAQ pain severity was -16.7 (3.2) in the placebo group and -29.7 (3.3) in the baricitinib group 
(p=0.003). In CHQ-PF50 Physical function Summary Sore, at week 44 the mean (SE) change from 
baseline was 10.5 (1.7) in the placebo group and 16.5 (1.7) in the baricitinib group (p=0.009).
In patients with juvenile PsA, at week 44 the mean (SE) change from baseline in PASI score was -0.8 
(0.4) in the patients (n=3) on placebo and -1.2 (0.3) in patients (n=4) on baricitinib (p=0.57). In 
patients with juvenile PsA or with ERA, at week 44 the mean (SE) change in SPARCC enthesitis index 
was -1.9 (0.2) in the placebo (n=23) group and -1.5 (0.3) in the baricitinib (n=20) group (p=0.21). 
The mean (SE) change in JSpADA index was -1.5 (0.3) in the placebo (n=23) group and -2.6 (0.3) in 
the baricitinib (n=20) group (p=0.019). 
Subgroup analysis for time-to-flare showed that the majority of treatment effects (hazard ratios) were 
between 0,22 – 0,30 with p-values <0.001, over subgroups of: prior biological DMARD use (yes/no), 
MTX use at baseline (yes/no), baseline ESR elevated (yes/no), JIA subtype (polyarticular and extended 
oligoarticular/juvenile PsA and ERA), female/male, age (≥9 / <9), region EU, corticosteroid use at 
baseline (yes/no), weight class (≥30 kg/<30 kg). 
When analysing maintenance of effect, the proportion of patients who achieve 
PedACR30/50/70/90/100 response using their baseline values in study JAHV showed that after 48 
weeks (n=126), 89% have at least PedACR30, while 81% have PedACR50 and 66% PedACR70, 
PedACR90 is reached by 49%.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects
The study design, with an open-label phase and a randomised placebo-controlled withdrawal phase, 
makes it more difficult to evaluate the clinical relevance of the treatment effect of baricitinib, as 
compared to placebo. However, this approach is accepted for studies in the paediatric population 
including JIA (EMA/CHMP/239770/2014 Rev. 2).
The dose that was derived from the PK modelling in RA adults was: 4 mg for children aged 9 years and 
above and adolescents up to 18 years and 2 mg for children less than 9 years of age, and this dose 
regimen was carried forward in pivotal trial JAHV and open-label extension trial JAHX. However, the 
dose proposed in the SmPC is weight based: 4 mg for patients ≥30 kg and 2 mg for patients <30 kg 
for patients aged 2-18 years. The dose proposal was based on PopPK modelling, which is an acceptable 
approach. However, based on the provided PopPK data, the Cmax is higher in paediatric patients with 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis weighing <20 kg with the current posology of 2 mg once daily compared to 
the currently treated adult patients. A lower dose (e.g. 1 mg) would however compromise efficacy in 
this subgroup. Considering this, it was acceptable to propose 2 mg dose daily for patients weighing 
<30 kg. The longer-term safety data of this subgroup will be provided in a category 3 PASS. 
The suspension used in the study is not yet approved nor submitted for marketing authorization. The 
Applicant provided the data that supports dissolving tablets in water for those patients who are not 
able to swallow tablets (sections 4.3 and 6.6 of SmPC), this is acceptable. Bioequivalence between the 
suspension used in the clinical study and the 4 mg tablets has been demonstrated in study JAGU. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects
A study in juvenile rats supports an assessment of safety in children aged 1 and up and has identified 
the bone as a target organ. Bone findings from the juvenile toxicity study in rats and reproductive 
toxicity studies in rabbits and rats suggest that skeletal concerns were only noted at exposures that 
are unlikely to be clinically relevant (>24x).  
A total of 220 patients was exposed to any dose of baricitinib in the JIA clinical trial program; 171 
patients were exposed to baricitinib for at least 52 weeks.
In the 12-week open-label period, most (57%) patients had at least 1 TEAE, and in the withdrawal 
phase, the proportion of patients with at least 1 TEAE was larger in the baricitinib group as compared 
to the placebo group (66% versus 47%).
The occurrence of severe and serious AEs and of discontinuations due to AEs was low. In the open-
label periods, 4 cases (1.8%) had a severe AE and 6 cases (2/7%) had a SAE; two (0.9%) patients 
discontinued due to an AE. In the placebo-controlled period, In the placebo group, 2 patients (2.5%) in 
the placebo group and 2 patients in the baricitinib group had at least one severe AE. There were 3 
patients (3.7%) in the placebo group and 4 patients (4.9%) in the baricitinib group with at least one 
SAE. Discontinuations due to AEs were infrequent in the placebo (n=2) and baricitinib (n=1) groups.
In the open-label period, most TEAEs occurred in the SOCs of infections and infestations (25%), 
gastrointestinal disorders (15%), and investigations (12%), but also in the SOC for musculoskeletal 
and connective tissue disorders (11%). The most frequently occurring TEAEs were: nasopharyngitis 
(8.6%), headache (6.4%), arthralgia (5.5%), nausea (5%), upper respiratory tract infection (5%), 
(upper) abdominal pain (5%), vomiting (4.5%).
In the randomised-withdrawal period, in most SOCs the occurrences of TEAEs were numerically higher 
for baricitinib as compared to placebo: infections and infestations (38% versus 19%), investigations 
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 102/110
(17% versus 2.5%), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (16% versus 10%), 
gastrointestinal disorders (15% versus 6.2%). The single TEAEs that were numerically more common 
in the baricitinib group as compared to placebo were: upper respiratory tract infection (11% versus 
1.2%), oropharyngeal pain (13% versus 3.4%), headache (11% versus 3.7%). But also clusters of 
abdominal pain (6.9% versus 17%) and rash (9.8% versus 3.4%) were more common the baricitinib 
group as compared to the placebo group. There was no difference between baricitinib and placebo in 
the occurrence of fractures (n=2 versus n=1), over this period. In the randomised-withdrawal period, 
3 (3.7%) patients in the placebo group had an SAE and 4 (4.9%) patients in the baricitinib treatment 
group had an SAE (COVID-19, Gastroenteritis, Headache, and Pulmonary embolism).
Comparing All JIA data with the baricitinib period, the occurrence of TEAEs (IR 242 versus 254), SAEs 
(IR 7.1 versus 7.1) and of discontinuations due to AEs (2.8 versus 2.4) was similar. In the All JIA data 
set, the most common TEAEs were similar to those already seen in the JAHV trial periods. Also, cases 
of herpes simplex (n=4, 1.8%) and herpes zoster (n=4, 1.8%), gastroenteritis (n=5, 2.3%), acne 
(n=9, 4.1%) started to emerge. In the All JIA safety set, 22 (10%) patients had ≥1 SAE, most (n=9) 
SAEs were musculoskeletal in nature (arthralgia, joint effusion, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, other 
manifestations). The other SAEs included: appendicitis, Bartholin’s abscess, soft tissue abscess, 
hepatic cytolysis, decreased appetite, ileus, bronchospasm, haematochezia, pulmonary embolism, 
amongst others; all these SAEs were single cases.
Out of 220 patients, there were 29 (13%) patients with a weight of <30 kg. A similar proportion of 
patients weighing ≥30 kg as compared with patients weighing <30 kg had TEAEs (83% versus 80%) 
and events in the Infections and infestations SOC (52% versus 55%). Twenty-one SAEs were reported 
in patients who weighed ≥30 kg, and 1 SAE was reported in children who weighed <30 kg (Ileus, 
considered unrelated). All serious infections and Herpes zoster were reported in the patient group who 
weighed ≥30 kg. 
No SAEs were reported in the youngest age group (≥2 to <6 years), and the frequency of SAEs was 
similar across the other age groups. The frequencies and IRs of TEAEs were similar across age groups 
except for the youngest group of patients (aged ≥2 to <6 years). 
There were no cases of MACE, malignancy, or DVT, there was 1 case of PE and 5 cases of serious 
infections. The available data on growth and skeletal development did not show abnormalities.
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects
Although there are a relatively large number of patients included and over 100 patients were exposed 
for at least one year, the safety experience in the youngest age group between 2 and 6 and between 6 
and 9 is limited. Most patients were between 12 - 18 (n=175, 80%) years old; only few patients were 
between 2 – 6 (n=6) and between 6 – 9 (n=9) years old. There were 29 (13%) patients with a weight 
of <30 kg. The posology proposed for the SmPC is weight-based (2mg if <30kg, 4mg if ≥30kg). As 
exposure, notably Cmax, is higher in children <20 kg on 2 mg, as compared to adults on 4 mg, safety in 
this subgroup was included in the post-marketing long term safety analyses that have been included in 
the RMP.
A randomised withdrawal design with an open-label lead-in period is acceptable for evaluating efficacy 
and safety in children, given that it can be extrapolated from the experience in adults. The bone 
safety/growth and long-term safety in children and adolescents will be followed-up in a Category 3 
PASS of the RMP.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects
Overall, it is considered that baricitinib is effective in the treatment of JIA, and that the effects are of 
clinical relevance and apply to all 4 subtypes of JIA studied.
The initially proposed indication included “baricitinib may be used as monotherapy or in combination 
with conventional synthetic DMARDs”. Because most participants used methotrexate concomittantly, 
the CHMP requested the Applicant to change it “as monotherapy or in combination of methotrexate”, 
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 104/110
which the MAH agreed. Regarding disease activity as well as considering treatment history, the study 
population was in line with the target population.
Based on the provided PopPK data, the Cmax is higher in paediatric patients with juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis weighing <20 kg with the current posology of 2 mg once daily compared to the currently 
treated adult patients. This could lead to additional safety issues. It is considered that the sample size 
of the risk groups is too small to exclude additional toxicity due to higher exposure, although the 
safety data that are available are reassuring. Long-term safety will be followed in a Category 3 PASS of 
the RMP, especially also in the lower weight and younger age groups. 
The primary outcome of the pivotal study JAHV was met: during the randomised withdrawal part of the 
study, patients on baricitinib were less likely to get a flare than patients on placebo (17% versus 51%, 
with a hazard ratio of 0.24, p<0.001). It is supportive for the proposed indication that the treatment 
effect in time-to-flare was present in three of the JIA subtypes, although not in the small juvenile PsA 
group where no flares occurred. There were trends supportive of improvement for patients with 
psoriasis, enthesis and axial spondyloarthritis, although these subgroups were smaller and between-
group differences were not always statistically significant. The results in time-to-flare (primary 
outcome) and PedACR30 response were consistent over subgroups, including JIA subtype 
(polyarthritis, extended oligoarthritis, juvenile PsA, ERA), for age groups/dose groups, weight groups, 
for patients with or without concomitant methotrexate, amongst others. The absence of flares in the 
jPsA group may be a chance finding. Juvenile PsA is known to come with flares, and flares in this 
subgroup did occur in a similar trial with an IL-17 inhibitor or placebo (Cosentyx SmPC), for example. 
Overall results should normally be extrapolatable to JIA subgroups in accordance with the EMA 
guideline on JIA. 
Besides the prevention of flares, the treatment goals in JIA include the reduction of disease activity 
and ultimately reaching inactive disease/remission. The difference between baricitinib and placebo in 
occurrence of flare is considered clinically relevant, which is notably supported by clinically relevant 
proportions of patients with a PedACR30, (50, 70 or 90), large reductions in the joint counts of -7 
(active) to -4 (limited ROM) that remain when staying on baricitinib in the withdrawal phase, a mean 
change of -12 in JADAS-27 that exceeds the estimated MID of -5.5 (Bulatovic 2013), a change of ~0.5 
in CHAQ disability index (range 0-3) which is supported by the change in CHQ-PF50 Phs, average 
changes >20 mm on Parent’s global assessment of well-being and CHAQ assessment of pain. By the 
end of the randomised withdrawal phase, there were numerically somewhat more patients with 
inactive disease in the baricitinib group (23%) as compared to the placebo group (14%), which 
illustrates that reaching remission in JIA is difficult to reach. In the long-term follow-up study JAHX, 
the proportions of patients with low disease activity/inactive disease increased over time.
When analysing all available safety data, the occurrence and pattern of AEs are in line with the known 
safety profile (ADRs) of baricitinib, including cases of herpes simplex and herpes zoster, gastroenteritis 
and acne. The occurrence of severe and serious AEs and discontinuations due to AEs was low. 
Surprisingly, the occurrence of musculoskeletal TEAEs was higher in the baricitinib group than in the 
placebo group; mainly mild arthralgia and mild synovitis. This is not considered to be causal but driven 
by selection by drop-out due to flare in the placebo group. 
In the All JIA safety set using all available follow-up data, the occurrence of and pattern of TEAEs, 
SAEs and discontinuations were basically similar to the baricitinib period in the randomised withdrawal 
phase and in line with what is known for baricitinib, also in the youngest and lowest weight children. 
However, numbers were small and safety in these groups will be solved with the inclusion of a 
Category 3 PASS of the RMP. Although the baricitinib exposure of the randomised withdrawal period is 
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 105/110
included in the All JIA data, and comparing IRs with different lengths of exposure is generally difficult, 
it is considered that there is no tendency that AEs would accumulate over time. 
MACE, DVT, and malignancies did not occur, while PE occurred in 1 case, and serious infections 
occurred in 5 cases. It is considered that due to the age range of the target population, these patients 
usually do not collect risk factors that rise the propensity for MACE, VTE and malignancies. From the 
non-clinical and available clinical data, there do not appear to be risks regarding bone safety, skeletal 
development or growth, but more data should be collected over a longer follow-up time in the post-
marketing setting.
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks
Baricitinib is effective for the treatment of JIA. The primary outcome of the pivotal study JADV was 
met: patients on baricitinib were less likely to get a flare than patients on placebo. The difference 
between baricitinib and placebo is clinically relevant and supported by the results of secondary 
outcomes. Over 1 – 2 years of treatment, it appears that in most patients, responses can be 
maintained without the occurrence of flares. The results in time-to-flare (primary outcome) and 
PedACR30 were basically consistent over subgroups, including JIA subtype (polyarthritis, extended 
oligoarthritis, juvenile PsA, ERA), for age groups/dose groups, weight groups, and for patients with or 
without concomitant methotrexate. 
Based on the available data, the safety profile of baricitinib in the doses of 1mg, 2 mg and 4 mg is 
acceptable in the studied paediatric population of patients with JIA. However, especially in the lower 
age (<9 years) and weight (<30 kg) categories, the number of patients is low. In patients weighing 
<20 kg, exposure was higher than estimated for adults, but a lower strength in this weight group 
would compromise efficacy. Therefore, the proposed posology of 2 mg daily for patients weighing 
<30 kg is acceptable. Long-term safety in these children will be followed post-marketing in a Category 
3 PASS, especially also if <20kg. From the non-clinical and available clinical data, there do not appear 
to be risks regarding bone safety, skeletal development or growth, but these risks have been included 
as missing information in the RMP and more data will be collected over a longer follow-up time in the 
post-marketing setting. 
3.8.  Conclusions
The overall benefit/risk balance of Olumiant new strength (1 mg) for the treatment of Juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis in patients 2 years of age and older who have had an inadequate response or 
intolerance to one or more prior conventional synthetic or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic 
drugs (DMARDs): Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular rheumatoid factor positive 
[RF+] or negative [RF-], extended oligoarticular), Enthesitis related arthritis, and Juvenile psoriatic 
arthritis is positive.
4.  Recommendations
 Outcome
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Olumiant new strength (1 mg), is favourable in the following indication:
Olumiant is indicated for the treatment of Juvenile idiopathic arthritis in patients 2 years of age and 
older who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to one or more prior conventional synthetic


Additional Patient Alert Cards
The guide for healthcare professionals shall contain the following key elements:


Indication and posology statements provided to reinforce in whom baricitinib should be used
That baricitinib increases the potential risk of infections. Patients should be instructed to seek 
immediate medical attention, if signs or symptoms suggesting infection appear. As there is a 
higher incidence of infections in the elderly and in the diabetic populations in general, caution 
should be used when treating the elderly and patients with diabetes. Baricitinib should only be 
used in patients 65 years of age and older if no suitable treatment alternatives are available. 

That baricitinib use should be stopped in case of herpes zoster or any other infection that 
doesn’t respond to standard treatment until the event resolves. Patients should not be 
immunised using live attenuated vaccines shortly before or during treatment with baricitinib. 




Prior to initiating treatment it is recommended that all patients, particularly paediatric patients, 
be brought up to date with all immunisations in agreement with local current immunisation 
guidelines
Prescribers should screen the patients for viral hepatitis before commencing baricitinib 
treatment. Active tuberculosis should also be ruled out. 
That baricitinib use is associated with hyperlipidaemia; prescribers should monitor the patient’s 
lipid parameters and manage the hyperlipidaemia, if detected. 
Baricitinib increases the risk of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. Baricitinib should be 
used with caution in patients with known risk factors for DVT/PE other than cardiovascular or 
malignancy risk factors. Patients should be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if signs 
or symptoms of DVT/PE appear.

That there is a potentially increased risk of MACE in patients with certain risk factors using JAK 
inhibitor treatment, including baricitinib. In patients 65 years of age and older , patients who are 
current or past long term smokers, and patients with other cardiovascular risk factors, baricitinib 
should only be used if no suitable treatment alternatives are available.

That Lymphoma and other malignancies have been reported in patients receiving JAK inhibitors, 
including baricitinib. In patients over 65 years of age, patients who are current or past long term 
smokers, or with other malignancy risk factors (e.g. current malignancy or history of malignancy) 
baricitinib should only be used if no suitable treatment alternatives are available. 

That baricitinib is contraindicated in pregnancy as pre-clinical data showed reduced foetal growth 
and malformations. Physicians should advise women of child bearing potential to use 
contraception during treatment and for a week after its ending. If a planned pregnancy is 
considered, baricitinib treatment should be stopped.

The purpose and use of the Patient Alert Card.
Assessment report 
EMA/365746/2023 
Page 108/110
The patient alert card shall contain the following key messages: 





That treatment with baricitinib may increase the risk of infections, and viral reactivation which 
can become serious if not treated. 
Signs or symptoms of infections including general symptoms, and specifically tuberculosis and 
herpes zoster signs and symptoms; and a warning for the patients to seek immediate medical 
attention if signs or symptoms suggesting infection appear.
Patients should seek immediate medical attention if signs and symptoms of myocardial 
infarction or stroke occur.
That baricitinib should not be taken while pregnant and that women should inform their doctor 
should they become (or wish to become) pregnant.
That baricitinib may cause a blood clot in the leg that may travel to the lungs; a description of 
signs and symptoms is provided, along with a warning for the patients to seek immediate medical 
attention if signs or symptoms suggesting a blood clot appear.

That baricitinib may cause non-melanoma skin cancer and that the patients should talk to their 
doctor if new skin lesions appear during or after therapy or if existing lesions change 
appearance, tell your doctor.
Contact details of the prescriber.
That the Patient Alert Card should be carried by the patient at any time and to share it with 
other healthcare professionals involved in their treatment.

MenQuadfi (meningococcal group A, C, W135 and Y 
conjugate vaccine) 
An overview of MenQuadfi and why it is authorised in the EU 
What is MenQuadfi and what is it used for? 
MenQuadfi is a vaccine used to protect adults and children from the age of 12 months against invasive 
meningococcal disease caused by four groups of the Neisseria meningitidis bacteria (group A, C, W, 
and Y). Invasive disease occurs when the bacteria spread through the body causing serious infections 
such as meningitis (infection of the membranes that surround the brain and spine) and septicaemia 
(blood poisoning). 
The vaccine contains substances from the outer coat of N. meningitidis bacteria. 
How is MenQuadfi used? 
MenQuadfi is given as a single injection into the shoulder muscle or on the side of the thigh. Some 
people can be given a booster dose.  
MenQuadfi can only be obtained with a prescription and should be used according to available official 
recommendations. For more information about using MenQuadfi, see the package leaflet or contact 
your doctor or pharmacist. 
How does MenQuadfi work? 
MenQuadfi is a vaccine. Vaccines work by preparing the immune system (the body’s natural defences) 
to defend the body against a specific disease.  
MenQuadfi contains small amounts of sugars from the outer coat of four groups of the N. meningitidis 
bacteria: A, C, W and Y. When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system recognises the 
sugars as ‘foreign’ and makes antibodies against them. If the person later comes into contact with the 
bacteria, these antibodies, together with other components of the immune system, will be able to fight 
off the bacteria more effectively and so help protect the person against the disease.

What benefits of MenQuadfi have been shown in studies? 
The ability of MenQuadfi to trigger the production of antibodies (immunogenicity) was assessed in 
seven main studies involving over 9,000 participants aged 1 year or older. MenQuadfi was compared 
with several other similar vaccines against N. meningitidis. Results showed that a single injection of 
MenQuadfi was as effective as the other vaccines in stimulating the body to produce antibodies that 
would protect against the four types of N. meningitidis.  
What are the risks associated with MenQuadfi? 
The most common side effects with MenQuadfi (which may affect more than 1 in 10 people) are 
headache, muscle pain, malaise (feeling unwell) and pain at the site of injection. For the full list of side 
effects and restrictions of MenQuadfi, see the package leaflet. 
Why is MenQuadfi authorised in the EU? 
MenQuadfi had been shown to be at least as effective as similar vaccines at stimulating an immune 
response to the four groups of the N. meningitidis bacteria in people of different age groups. 
Furthermore, MenQuadfi is well tolerated and there were no reports of serious or unexpected side 
effects. The European Medicines Agency therefore decided that MenQuadfi’s benefits are greater than 
its risks and it can be authorised for use in the EU. 
What measures are being taken to ensure the safe and effective use of 
MenQuadfi? 
The company that markets MenQuadfi will complete studies to assess the effects of a second dose of 
the vaccine (a booster) after previous vaccination with MenQuadfi or a similar vaccine. 
Recommendations and precautions to be followed by healthcare professionals and patients for the safe 
and effective use of MenQuadfi have also been included in the summary of product characteristics and 
the package leaflet. 
As for all medicines, data on the use of MenQuadfi are continuously monitored. Side effects reported 
with MenQuadfi are carefully evaluated and any necessary action taken to protect patients.

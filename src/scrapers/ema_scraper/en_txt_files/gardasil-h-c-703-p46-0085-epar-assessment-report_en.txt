Description 
Methods 
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
EMA/420632/2017  
Page 3/11 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
To investigate the incidences of CIN 2/3, AIS and/or cervical cancer related to HPV types 6, 11, 16 or 
18 in Japanese women aged 16 to 26 years who had been vaccinated with the quadrivalent HPV L1 VLP 
vaccine, and were seronegative to relevant HPV type on Day 1 and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) 
negative from Day 1 through Month 7. 
Exploratory objectives: 
1) To investigate the incidence of external genital lesion (condyloma acuminata, VIN 1/2/3, VaIN 
1/2/3, vulvar cancer and/or vaginal cancer) related to HPV types 6, 11, 16 or 18 in Japanese women 
aged 16 to 26 years who had been vaccinated with the quadrivalent HPV L1 VLP vaccine, and were 
seronegative to relevant HPV type on Day 1 and PCR negative from Day 1 through Month 7. 
2) To evaluate safety and tolerability after 3-dose regimen of quadrivalent HPV L1 VLP vaccine. 
Study design 
Multi-center, open-label, single-arm study. The trial was conducted at 21 trial centers in Japan. 
Study population /Sample size 
Inclusion criteria: Subjects who met the following criteria at Visit 1 (Day 1) were eligible for the study. 
1) Healthy Japanese females aged 16 to 26 years. 
2) Subjects (or, for minor subjects, parent/legal guardian and subject) fully understand study 
procedures, alternative treatments available, the risks involved with the study and voluntarily agree to 
participate by giving written informed consent. 
3) No clinical evidence of gross purulent cervicitis (otherwise postpone until the completion of 
treatment or obtaining confirmation on examination that no further treatment is required). 
4) Agree to refrain from douching/vaginal cleansing or using vaginal medication or preparation for 2 
calendar days prior to any scheduled visit that includes pelvic examination. 
5) Agree to refrain from sexual activity (including vaginal and anal penetration, and any genital 
contact) for 2 calendar days prior to any scheduled visit that includes a pelvic exam, in an attempt to 
avoid detection of viral DNA which has been deposited in the vagina or on the perineal/perianal area 
during sexual intercourse and is not the result of ongoing infection. 
6) Not pregnant (as determined by human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG] urine pregnancy test with 
sensitivity ≥25 mIU/mL), and agree to use effective contraception through Month 7 of the study. 
Effective contraception includes oral contraceptives or injection contraception, intrauterine device 
(IUD), sterilization, abstinence, condom (male), diaphragm and cervical cap. 
7) Individuals who have had sexual intercourse within 2 weeks prior to enrollment must have been 
using effective contraception as defined above. (Emergency contraception is not considered effective 
contraception for enrollment in the study.) 
8) Individuals with a lifetime history of 0 to 4 male or female sexual partners. Women with 0 lifetime 
male or female sexual partners must be at least 18 years of age and plan to become sexually active 
within the first 3 months of the study. 
9) Agree to provide the investigators or study collaborator with telephone numbers (priority and 
second priority numbers) for followup purposes. 
10) No oral temperature ≥37.5°C within 24 hours prior to the first investigational vaccination.

The number of subjects In the study was 1030.  
Treatments 
HPV Type 6/11/16/18 vaccine contains L1 VLP 20/40/40/20 μg respectively in 0.5 mL per dose. A total 
of 3 vaccinations were given on Day 1, Month 2 and Month 6.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint: Incidence of CIN 2/3, AIS and/or cervical cancer relative to HPV Type 6, 11, 
16 or 18.  
Exploratory efficacy endpoint: Incidence of external genital lesion (condyloma acuminatum, VIN 1/2/3, 
VaIN 1/2/3, vulvar cancer and/or vaginal cancer) relevant to HPV Type 6, 11, 16 or 18. 
Other endpoints: - Incidence of CIN 1/2/3, AIS and/or cervical cancer relative to all HPV types. 
- Incidence of external genital lesion relative to all HPV types. 
Safety endpoint: Vaccine-related serious adverse events, death, and new medical conditions occurred 
during the entire study period and adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) occurred 
between Day 1 and Day 15 of each study vaccination  
Statistical Methods 
Statistical analysis plan 
Efficacy 
For the effectiveness analyses, if a subject had experienced one or more lesion (event) that comprise 
each endpoint, the event detected for the first time was included in the analyses. The event was 
counted only when the lesion that comprises each endpoint occurred in the subject. In each 
effectiveness analysis, 1 event at a maximum was counted for one subject. In individual analysis of 
each HPV type and each lesion that comprise the composite endpoint, the lesion that occurred was 
counted as 1 for each sub category. When a lesion occurred in more than one sub category, the lesion 
was counted as 1 in each sub category. Missing data were not imputed.  
Safety and tolerability 
AEs and SAEs between Day 1 and Day 15 of each study vaccination, and death, vaccine-related SAEs 
and new medical conditions during the entire study period were counted. Primary safety endpoint was 
the incidence of vaccine-related SAEs during the entire study period. In the interim analysis, efficacy 
and safety data through Month 24 were analyzed. 
Analysis description (Efficacy) 
For the effectiveness analyses, point estimates and exact 95% confidence interval (CI) for incidence of 
event was computed based on Poisson distribution. Wherever possible, incidence rate estimates from 
this study were visually compared to the corresponding rates observed in other studies of quadrivalent 
HPV L1 VLP vaccines and other relevant epidemiologic data in and outside Japan. 
In the primary analysis in Per-protocol efficacy [PPE] population, follow-up period started after Month 7 
visit. Therefore, follow-up period for each subject was obtained by calculating the number of days from 
her Month 7 visit to her final visit. For the subjects who experienced the event, "final visit" was the 
first day of visit at which lesion was detected to calculate person-day. This value was converted to 
EMA/420632/2017  
Page 5/11 
 
 
  
 
 
 
person-years by dividing by 365.25. The total follow-up period was the sum of person-years of all 
subjects. A subject treated with definitive therapy was not to be censored for the relevant 
effectiveness evaluations on and after the start of therapy. If biopsy specimen obtained before or 
during the definitive therapy met the definition of the event for the relevant endpoint, the subject was 
considered to have an event. 
With respect to missing serology results for any HPV type on Day 1, the occurrence of the lesion event 
of the subject for the relevant type of HPV was not to be counted. With respect to missing PCR status 
of swab specimen, existence of missing data determined the counting of the event occurrence for each 
subject. It means that for swab specimen obtained on Day 1 or Month 7, if at least one PCR status to 
any HPV type contained in the investigational vaccine was missing, the occurrence of the lesion event 
of the relevant HPV type for the subject was not to be counted. For biopsy specimen obtained between 
Day 1 and Month 7 (inclusive), if any of PCR status of them was missing, the event of the relevant HPV 
type for the subject occurred after Month 7 visit was not to be counted when the biopsy result showed 
pathological abnormalities and to be counted when the biopsy result was normal. This rule was 
established because abnormal tissue is likely to be HPV PCR-positive. 
Efficacy Analysis population 
Four efficacy populations (PPE, HPV-naïve to the relevant type [HNRT], Full analysis set [FAS] and 
Generally-HPV naïve population [GHN]) are defined as follows. 
- PPE Population: All subjects who received 3 doses of investigational vaccination within 1 year, and 
had 1 or more follow-up data after Month 7, did not have any general protocol violations that could 
affect the efficacy evaluation of the investigational vaccination, and were seronegative to the relevant 
HPV type on Day 1, and PCR swab tests and PCR in biopsy specimen were negative from Day 1 
through Month 7. 
- HNRT Population: All subjects who were seronegative and PCRnegative (on swabs and biopsies) to 
the relevant vaccine HPV type(s) on Day 1, who received at least 1 investigational vaccination, and 
who had at least 1 follow-up data after Day 1. 
- FAS Population: All subjects who received at least 1 investigational vaccination and who had at least 
1 follow-up data after Day 1, regardless of initial serology and PCR status on Day 1. 
- GHN Population: All subjects who received at least 1 study vaccination, who were sero- and PCR-
negative on Day 1 to all vaccine HPV types (6, 11, 16 and 18), who were PCR-negative on Day 1 to all 
non-vaccine HPV types with PCR assays available, who had a negative Day 1 Papanicolaou (Pap) test 
result and who had at least 1 follow-up data after Day 1. 
The cut-offs for the HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 are defined 20 milli Merck Units per milliliter (mMU/mL), 16 
mMU/mL, 20 mMU/mL and 24 mMU/mL by competitive Luminex Immunoassay, respectively when a 
subject is considered seropositive or seronegative to HPV Type 6, 11, 16 and 18. 
For primary and exploratory endpoints, PPE was primary population, and HNRT, FAS and GHN were 
supplemental population. For other endpoints, HNRT, FAS and GHN were used as the analysis 
populations. 
Analysis description (Safety) 
All AEs occurred between Day 1 and Day 15 of each investigational vaccination were counted. Safety 
and tolerability were clinically assessed on all safety endpoints including AEs. As this study had only 1 
treatment group, the following parameters were counted.

Efficacy results 
Evaluation of the incidences of CIN 1/2/3, AIS, cervical cancer and external genital lesion following the 
quadrivalent HPV L1 VLP vaccination in 16 to 26 year-old Japanese women demonstrated the results as 
follows. 
Primary endpoint: 
- As a result of evaluation of incidences of CIN 2/3, AIS and/or cervical cancer relative to HPV types 6, 
11, 16 or 18 in the primary population (PPE), no event was reported and the incidence of the event 
(/100 person-years) was 0.0 (95%CI: 0.0, 0.1). 
- As a result of evaluation of incidences of CIN 2/3, AIS and/or cervical cancer relative to HPV types 6, 
11, 16 or 18 in the supplemental populations (HNRT, FAS and GHN), 14 events were reported only in 
FAS, and the incidence of the event (/100 person-years) in HNRT, FAS and GHN were 0.0 (95%CI: 0.0, 
0.1), 0.4 (95%CI: 0.2, 0.6) and 0.0 (95%CI: 0.0, 0.1), respectively. 
Exploratory endpoints: 
- As a result of evaluation of incidences of external genital lesion (condyloma acuminata, VIN 1/2/3, 
VaIN 1/2/3, vulvar cancer and/or vaginal cancer) relative to HPV types 6, 11, 16 or 18 in the primary 
EMA/420632/2017  
Page 9/11 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
population (PPE), no event was reported and the incidence (/100 person-years) of the event was 0.0 
(95%CI: 0.0, 0.1). 
- As a result of evaluation of external genital lesion relative to HPV types 6, 11, 16 or 18 in the 
supplemental populations (HNRT, FAS and GHN), no events were reported in any of populations, and 
the incidences (/100 person-years) of the event were all 0.0 (95%CI: 0.0, 0.1). 
Other endpoints: 
- As a result of evaluation of incidences of CIN 1/2/3, AIS and/or cervical cancer relative to all HPV 
types, 73 events were reported only in FAS, and the incidences (/100 personyears) of the event in 
HNRT, FAS and GHN were 0.0 (95%CI: 0.0, 0.1), 2.0 (95%CI: 1.6, 2.5) and 0.0 (95%CI: 0.0, 0.1), 
respectively. Of the events reported in FAS, 27 events were severe graded as CIN 2 or worse 
(incidence: 0.7/100 personyears, 95%CI: 0.5, 1.1). 
- As a result of evaluation of incidence of external genital lesions (condyloma acuminata, VIN 1/2/3, 
VaIN 1/2/3, vulvar cancer and/or vaginal cancer) relative to all HPV types, one event was reported in 
HNRT, FAS and GHN, respectively. Incidences (/100 person-years) of the event in HNRT, FAS and GHN 
were 0.0 (95%CI: 0.0, 0.1), 0.0 (95%CI: 0.0, 0.1) and 0.0 (95%CI: 0.0, 0.2), respectively. 
Safety results 
Evaluation of the safety and tolerability after 3-dose regimen of quadrivalent HPV L1 VLP vaccination in 
16 to 26 year-old Japanese women demonstrated the results as follows. 
- The incidence of injection site AEs reported from Day 1 to Day 15 of each investigational vaccination 
was 14.5% (149/1,029 subjects). All of these events were AEs considered to be related to the 
investigational vaccine except for one event. All of them were mild except for one moderate of 
injection site pain. Most events resolved within 15 days after the occurrence. 
- The incidence of non-injection site AEs and vaccine-related AEs reported from Day 1 to Day 15 of 
each investigational vaccination were 23.5% (242/1,029 subjects) and 8.6% (89/1,029 subjects), 
respectively. 
- Incidence of SAEs reported during the entire study period was 0.8% (8/1,029 subjects: Abortion 
induced in 4 subjects, abortion spontaneous, peritonsillitis, subarachnoid haemorrhage and foetal 
malpresentation in 1 subject each). All of these events were considered not related to the 
investigational vaccine by the investigators. One adverse event leading to death (subarachnoid 
haemorrhage, described above) was reported. 
- One subject discontinued investigational vaccine due to mild urticaria occurring 2 days after the first 
investigational vaccination, and recovered 2 days after the occurrence of AE. 
- Three dose regimen of quadrivalent HPV L1 VLP vaccine was generally safe and well tolerated. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In the PPE population there were no cases of CIN 2/3, AIS and/or cervical cancer relative to HPV types 
6, 11, 16 or 18 at 48 months after the first vaccination. In the FAS population there were 14 events 
reported of the above endpoints. Likewise there were no cases of external genital lesion (condyloma 
acuminata, VIN 1/2/3, VaIN 1/2/3, vulvar cancer and/or vaginal cancer) relative to HPV types 6, 11, 
16 or 18 in the PPE as well as the supplemental populations. It is not reported what the background 
incidence in the population is. The study was descriptive and no comparisons were made. The results 
EMA/420632/2017

are in agreement with previously reported studies. No concern regarding lacking efficacy is raised from 
this study.  
The safety results are also in agreement with previously reported studies. No new safety concern is 
raised from this study.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant UCB Pharma S.A. submitted on 21 November 2017 an application for marketing authorisation 
to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Evenity, through the centralised procedure falling within the 
Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.  
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and in men at increased risk of fractures (see section 
5.1). 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and 
clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting 
certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0066/2016 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0066/2016 was not yet completed as some measures 
were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to 
the proposed indication. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance romosozumab contained in the above medicinal product to be 
considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a medicinal 
product previously authorised within the European Union.

women at increased risk of fracture’, while the final SA request submitted by UCB targeted the indication in 
women and men, i.e. the indication assessed by the CHMP. The Scientific advice pertained to the following 
non-clinical and clinical aspects: 
•  Design and duration of the proposed non-clinical bone quality studies 
•  Adequacy of plans to characterise the carcinogenic potential 
•  Acceptability not to perform PK drug-drug-interaction studies 
•  Acceptability of the proposed pivotal Phase 3 study designs (Protocol 20070337 and Protocol 
20110142) focusing on postmenopausal osteoporosis in women: population, endpoints, comparators, 
trial duration, timing of analyses, statistical analyses plans and adequacy of Phase 2 data to support 
Phase 3 design 
•  Sufficiency of the two Phase 3 studies (one placebo controlled, one alendronate controlled) to support 
benefit/risk assessment at the time of MAA 
•  Adequacy of the planned safety assessments and database 
•  Adequacy of plans to demonstrate bioequivalence study to support a 120mg/ml PFS product 
presentation, a 90 mg/mL PFS presentation and a 90mg/ml PFP product presentation 
•  Suitability of 90 mg/mL PFS and 90 mg/mL PFP presentations for administration by healthcare 
professionals or care givers, or for self-administration by patients following appropriate training 
•  Sufficiency of data to be generated in 3 clinical studies (20070337, 20110142, and 20060326) with 
long(er) term follow-up periods to satisfy the post licensing commitment for follow-up information for 
up to 5 years

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Romosozumab was intended for treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women (PMO) and in adult 
men at increased risk of fractures. The approved indication is severe osteoporosis in postmenopausal women 
at high risk of fracture.  Male osteoporosis ia not included in the approved indication (see section 3.5). 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Osteoporosis is defined as a disease characterised by low bone mass and micro-architectural deterioration of 
bone tissue, leading to enhanced bone fragility and a consequent increase in fracture risk. 
In Europe, 22 million women and 5.5 million men were estimated to have osteoporosis in 2010; and 3.5 
million possibly osteoporosis related fractures were sustained. Most fractures occur at the spine, wrist and 
hip. The vast majority of osteoporotic fractures occur in postmenopausal women and the incidence increases 
markedly with age. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Primary osteoporosis is often associated with oestrogen deficiency and/or age-related skeletal deterioration. 
Besides age and menopause, risk factors for osteoporosis include smoking, inactivity, previous fractures and 
white or Asian race. 
Osteoporosis is characterised by an imbalance between bone resorption and bone formation. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
Osteoporosis is characterised by low bone mineral density (BMD). Osteoporosis is defined by a T-score 
≤ -2.50 in lumbar spine or total hip, according to WHO.  
Osteoporosis per se is asymptomatic and does generally not become clinically apparent until a fracture 
occurs.  
2.1.5.  Management 
In the EU, pharmacologic therapies for osteoporosis and the prevention of osteoporotic fractures consist of 
several types of antiresorptive therapies (including bisphosphonates, RANKL inhibitors and selective 
oestrogen receptor modulators), bone-forming agents (parathyroid hormone [PTH] analogues) and calcium 
and Vitamin D3 preparations are also used.

2.1.6.  About the product 
Romosozumab (formerly known as AMG 785 and CDP7851) is a humanized IgG2 monoclonal antibody that 
binds and inhibits sclerostin. Romosozumab has a dual effect on bone turnover. Romosozumab increases 
bone formation due to the activation of bone lining cells, increased bone matrix production by osteoblasts, 
and recruitment of osteoprogenitor cells. Additionally, romosozumab results in changes to expression of 
osteoclast mediators, thereby decreasing bone resorption. 
The commercial product was proposed to be presented in a single-use plastic prefilled syringe (PFS) 
containing 1.17 mL of a 90 mg/mL romosozumab solution. Thus, 2 injections are required to achieve the 
210 mg dose.   
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Romosozumab is a humanised IgG2 monoclonal antibody produced using recombinant DNA technology in 
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. 
The finished product is presented as a solution for subcutaneous injection in pre-filled pen (PFP) or pre-filled 
syringe (PFS). Each PFP or PFS contains 105 mg of romosozumab in 1.17 mL of solution (90 mg/mL). 
Other ingredients are calcium acetate, glacial acetic acid, sodium hydroxide, sucrose, polysorbate 20 and 
water for injections. The finished product is a clear to opalescent, colourless to light yellow solution. 
Evenity is presented as a pack of 2 PFP or 2 PFS, or a multipack containing 6 (3 packs of 2) PFP or PFS. Not 
all pack sizes may be marketed.  
The PFS and PFP are for single use and are disposable. The PFS is made from cyclo-olefin polymer plastic 
with a stopper (chlorobutyl) and insert moulded stainless steel needle and elastomeric needle shield 
(synthetic rubber). The PFP is a handheld mechanical injection device pre-assembled with the PFS. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
Romosozumab consists of 2 heavy chains of the lgG2 subclass and 2 light chains of the human kappa 
subclass.  Romosozumab contains 36 total cysteine residues involved in both intrachain and interchain 
disulfide bonds.  There are 6 intermolecular disulfides. Each heavy chain contains 449 amino acids with 
4 intrachain disulfides.  Each light chain contains 214 amino acids with 2 intrachain disulfides.  
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
Manufacturer(s) 
Romosozumab active substance is manufactured at Immunex Rhode Island Corporation (referred to as 
Amgen Rhode Island or ARI) in accordance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP). ARI is a 
registered commercial active substance manufacturing facility.  
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 13/263 
  
  
Description of the manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacturing process begins with cell culture and harvest of CHO cells. The process includes steps for 
expanding the culture in shake flasks, a culture bag, and expansion bioreactors to inoculate the N production 
bioreactor to produce romosozumab. The purification of romosozumab is achieved through a series of 
chromatography, filtration, and viral inactivation steps.  
The manufacturing process, divided into the different unit operations, is adequately described and justified 
with a sufficient level of detail included also covering target set limits and acceptable ranges for the critical 
process parameters (CPPs) as well as in-process controls (IPCs) for each process-step. Product pools may be 
held prior to further processing at the subsequent step in accordance with validated hold times. This is found 
acceptable.  
The applicant also states that “Any reprocessing event will be preceded by an approved reprocessing 
protocol. No reprocessed material will be released for use without appropriate regulatory notification and 
approval as required.” This is found acceptable. 
Control of materials 
All materials have been listed and specifications for non-compendial materials have been provided. No 
material of biological origin, except the CHO production cell line, was used in the manufacturing process. 
Foetal bovine serum (FBS) was used in development of the production cell line (pre-master cell bank (MCB)). 
Acceptable information has been provided for the FBS. TSE and virus safety is further discussed below. 
 The cell line development and cell banking has also been described in sufficient detail.  
Characterisation of MCB, working cell bank (WCB) and cells at the limit of in vitro cell age (LIVCA) have been 
performed in compliance with ICH Q5A and ICH Q5D. Sterility, mycoplasma testing, isoenzyme analysis, and 
viral testing were performed (for test for adventitious agents, please refer to section “Adventitious agents 
safety” below). The specification acceptance criteria were met, showing that the cell banks are sterile and 
free of detectable mycoplasma and viruses, with the exception of expected A-type and C-type retrovirus like 
particles as expected for CHO cells. A protocol containing detailed acceptance criteria for creation of potential 
future WCB has also been provided. This protocol is found acceptable and no variation application is needed 
for new WCB conforming to these criteria.  
In addition, acceptable data confirming genetic stability of the production cell lines have been provided. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The control strategy for the romosozumab active substance process includes direct control of process inputs 
and evaluation of the performance of the process. A performance indicator is a measurement (output) which 
is used to evaluate in-process performance. Performance indicators allow direct assessment of product 
quality and/or process consistency. Performance indicators are evaluated against predetermined limits during 
process validation and a subset of performance indicators are designated as in-process controls (IPCs) for 
routine manufacture. IPCs that should be controlled within a defined range to ensure final product quality are 
designated as critical. Limits for IPCs are categorised as rejection, action, or control limits (Table 1). 
Rejection limits are established to assure no adverse impact to patient safety. A rejection limit, if exceeded 
or, in some cases, equalled, results in batch rejection. Action limits facilitate monitoring of process 
consistency. An excursion to an action limit requires an investigation which includes an assessment of impact 
to the product and processes, investigation of potential root cause, and as appropriate, corrective and/or 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 14/263 
  
  
preventive actions to prevent recurrence. If an IPC action limit is exceeded, resolution of the investigation is 
a pre-requisite for lot disposition and can result in lot rejection if product impact is determined. 
In addition to action and rejection limits, the process monitoring program establishes and assesses internal 
control limits which provide additional confirmation that the manufacturing process is operating in a state of 
statistical control and helps to identify potential process trends or shifts. Internal control limits are initially 
established to be the same as the action limits. Once sufficient manufacturing experience has been obtained, 
internal control limits are established using generally accepted statistical process control practices. For 
parameters not amenable to statistical treatment (e.g. microbial control limits), the limits are set to provide 
sufficient sensitivity for process monitoring. Control limits are reviewed periodically and can be revised over 
time to reflect the expected performance of the manufacturing process. 
A summary of the critical process parameters for the active substance process has been provided and the 
rationale for their classification and acceptable ranges has been given. 
Process validation 
The commercial manufacturing process for romosozumab has been validated by demonstrating that the 
process met pre-defined acceptance criteria for performance when run within defined process parameters. 
Acceptable ranges for process parameters and acceptance criteria for performance indicators were defined 
based upon process characterisation and small-scale studies. The process verification and evaluation data is 
comprehensive and in support for a consistent performance of the manufacturing process. The verification 
and evaluation were performed on 3 consecutive process validation batches of active substance. Process 
verification and evaluation were performed at commercial scale but some aspects were run at reduced scale 
such as viral inactivation and viral clearance. The validation was run at set-points while the ranges of process 
parameters were challenged during the process characterisation and small-scale studies in manufacturing 
process development. This is found acceptable.  
Manufacturing process development 
The applicant has thoroughly described the studies on manufacturing process development, including process 
development and process characterisation of both the cell culture and the purification process, the integrated 
control strategy, given a description of the lot history as well as a demonstration of comparability of active 
substance. 
Comparability 
The comparability of active substance has been assessed throughout development. The commercial process 
has, in addition, been scaled-up and transferred from the clinical manufacturing site at ATO to the 
commercial site at ARI. A comprehensive comparability strategy was designed and executed in accordance 
with the guidance in ICH Q5E by lot release, characterisation and stress stability data. The results presented 
on the comparability assessment show that active substance manufactured at ATO and ARI are comparable. 
Process characterisation (cell culture and purification) 
The commercial manufacturing process was characterised in order to define a robust control strategy that 
consistently delivers the required quality of the active substance. The studies served as a basis for 
establishing controls for process parameters as well as for defining IPCs for routine manufacturing and 
establishment of acceptance criteria for the process validation. The process-parameters were evaluated in 
small-scale studies through design of experiments (DoE) and/or univariate experiments. The small scale 
models and DoE experiments are found justified and acceptable. The applicant’s definition of acceptable 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 15/263 
  
  
ranges allows for variation of more than one process parameter at a time. No design space is claimed. The 
proposed manufacturing description with the identified acceptable ranges is generally acceptable, as is the 
applicant’s definition of acceptable ranges. It was assured that any negative effects due to potential 
interactions between process parameters will be detected by the proposed control strategy. This is found 
acceptable.  
As requested by the CHMP, the applicant has provided a sufficient justification regarding the chosen impact 
ratio limit for criticality (>0.2) for process parameters.  
High mannose content in active substance pool 
The applicant proposed not to add routine monitoring of high mannose as an IPC or in the active specification 
but instead commits to perform high mannose tests as a characterisation method in comparability studies to 
support process changes. The justification is based upon the conclusions from the product quality attribute 
risk assessment taking into account that high mannose is controlled consistently to levels shown to be safe 
and efficacious during commercial manufacturing. The high mannose content of romosozumab was 
sufficiently justified at a level that would not cause a significant change on the clearance when compared to 
the actual range seen in romosozumab active substance commercial manufacturing. In addition, the applicant 
presented data on clinical immunogenicity rates for two other monoclonal antibodies, which is found relevant 
for this issue. This is found acceptable. 
Characterisation 
Extensive biochemical characterisation of romosozumab was performed using state-of-the art methods. All 
elucidation of structure studies were conducted on romosozumab material manufactured, the commercial 
process. Primary structure, glycosylation, disulfide structure, charge variants, and size variants were 
characterised and a few complementary analytical methods. The results support the expected amino acid 
sequence of the protein. In addition, common product variants were identified. Protein oxidation and 
deamidation was investigated and relevant sites were identified. The expected glycosylation site, Asn299 was 
elucidated as the single N-glycosylation site. Furthermore, the typical IgG2 disulfide structure was observed 
and romosozumab was shown to exist primarily in its expected monomeric form. Overall, the analytical 
procedures and the results are found acceptable.  
The biophysical evaluation confirmed that romosozumab is folded and contains well-defined secondary and 
tertiary structures that are consistent with other IgG2 antibodies. Two potency assays were applied to 
measure biological activity of romosozumab in vitro. A cell-based reporter gene bioassay demonstrated that 
romosozumab inhibits the action of sclerostin. Furthermore, an antigen binding assay was applied to monitor 
romosozumab’s ability to bind to sclerostin.  
Five product-related impurities were identified and evaluated. All impurities were demonstrated to be well-
controlled by the manufacturing process, recommended storage conditions, and associated analytical 
monitoring. The process-related impurities HCP, DNA and residual protein A were demonstrated to be 
reduced to low or non-detectable levels in active substance, in small-scale studies as well as in commercial 
scale.  were evaluated for clearance and all tested reagents were cleared below the assay limit of quantitation 
(LoQ) through the process. The estimated worst-case dose was demonstrated not to be critical. The methods 
used and results obtained for impurities are found acceptable.

Specification 
The specification for the active substance is listed in Table 2 and includes control of identity, purity and 
impurities, potency and adventitious agents.  
Relevant tests are included in the specification for the active substance although the number and extent of 
the proposed tests were originally considered sparse. The applicant proposed instead several in-process 
control tests at different steps during the purification process. The combination of tests as IPCs and in the 
specification is considered acceptable. This is considered acceptable. All these control parameters are 
included in the finished product specifications and this is considered as acceptable.  
The justification given for omitting analyses from routine testing is found acceptable and justified. As 
requested by the CHMP, the applicant provided an acceptable justification that the polyclonal antibody used 
in the HCP assay can detect a sufficiently high percentage of HCPs present. 
As requested by the CHMP, the active substance specification has been updated with references to in-house 
method numbers and Ph. Eur. references in order to have a clear link to the description and validation of 
analytical procedures used for release and stability testing.  
Analytical procedures  
The analytical methods used to test active substance are described in the dossier and system and sample 
suitability criteria are defined. The bioassay measuring the ability of romosozumab to inhibit sclerostin is 
acceptably described and validated, the relative potency is calculated in accordance with the 4-Parameter 
Logistic (4 PL) model described in Ph Eur 5.3. As requested, validation reports have been submitted to show 
that the in-house bioburden method is comparable to Ph Eur 2.6.12. The method descriptions are found 
acceptable. Comprehensive analytical validation summaries in line with ICH Q2 (R1) are provided for all non-
compendial methods.   
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data for romosozumab active substance has been presented for all lots used during clinical 
development and for active substance manufactured at commercial scale at the commercial manufacturing 
facility (ARI). All data complies with the active substance specifications in place at the time of manufacture. 
The information is sufficient and acceptable, demonstrating consistency in manufacturing. 
Reference standard 
The applicant employs a comprehensive and controlled process to manage romosozumab reference 
standards. The process includes production of early, interim reference standards during clinical development, 
production of a primary reference standard from commercial material, production of working reference 
standards as necessary through the lifecycle of the product, and a stability and shelf-life extension program 
to ensure all reference standards remain appropriate for use. The history of the romosozumab reference 
standards was provided. A comparison of release data from the current interim, the primary and the working 
romosozumab reference standards was provided, which demonstrates consistency and continuity between all 
three reference standards. A reference standard qualification protocol is included to demonstrate how future 
working reference standards will be qualified as fit-for-purpose.

Container closure 
The romosozumab active substance container closure system is a 10 L polycarbonate carboy container sealed 
with a polypropylene screw cap closure containing a thermoplastic elastomer gasket. The container closure 
system is described in sufficient detail and no concerns are raised.  
Stability  
The proposed shelf-life for romosozumab active substance is 60 months when stored at the recommended 
storage condition of -30°C.  
The on-going stability program for active substance at the recommended storage condition at -30°C includes 
60 months stability data for 3 primary lots, 24 to 36 months stability data for 3 production lots and 36 to 48 
months stability data for 2 supporting lots. In addition, data are presented on experimental (-20°C for 1 
month), accelerated (+5°C for 6 months) and stressed (+25°C for 6 months and +40°C for 3 months) 
storage conditions. 
The primary lots produced at ATO are representative of lots produced at the commercial manufacturing scale 
and site at ARI as demonstrated through analytical comparability analysis described in the section on 
manufacturing process development.  
From the active substance specification, it is seen that the same limits are applied for active substance both 
at release and at stability (end-of-shelf-life specification) for all tests with one exception. 
The proposed shelf-life for romosozumab active substance of 60 months at -30°C is found acceptable.  
Any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the EMA. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development   
Description of the product 
The composition of Evenity solution for injection in pre-filled syringe and in pre-filled pen is presented. All 
excipients are of compendial quality and comply with the corresponding Ph. Eur. monographs. No formula 
overages are included.  
Pharmaceutical development 
An acceptable overview is provided on the development of the formulation, including satisfactory data 
supporting the proposed composition of the commercial finished product.  
Pivotal clinical studies were performed with a 70 mg/ml formulation in glass syringes with a fill volume of 1 
mL while the commercial 90 mg/mL formulation is for a fill volume of 1.17 mL in plastic a cyclic olefin 
polymer) syringes. The 90 mg/mL formulation was developed to reduce the number of injections required per 
dose from three to two. The final 90 mg/ml formulation was included in a bioequivalence and a clinical non-
inferiority study.  
Several analytical comparability studies were conducted to evaluate impact to finished product quality after 
changes to the active substance process, finished product primary container, concentration, fill volume and 
Assessment report

changes in finished product manufacturing sites. The comparability between the 70 mg/mL and the 90 
mg/mL finished product has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
The primary container closure system consists of a plastic syringe barrel with an insert moulded stainless 
steel needle, an elastomeric needle shield and a fluoropolymer laminated chlorobutyl elastomeric plunger-
stopper.  
The information provided for the delivery devices is comprehensive, and confirms the suitability of the chosen 
devices. The pre-filled syringe and the pre-filled pen (auto-injector) forms two separate integral products, 
and are not considered as separate medical devices. However, design verification was performed as per ISO 
11608-1, and compliance with Medical Device Directive Essential Requirements has been demonstrated as 
expected. It is also stated that the risk management principles in ISO 14971:2012 "Medical Devices – 
Application of Risk Management to Medical Devices" were used throughout the development.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture 
Evenity is manufactured and filled into the primary container closure system at Patheon, Monza, Italy and 
shipped to Amgen Europe BV, Breda, Netherlands for final assembly of the pre-filled syringe and the pre-filled 
pen.  
The manufacturing process is summarised in a flow chart and detailed in a written narrative description. The 
manufacturing process includes the following process steps; active substance thawing and pooling, dilution 
with formulation buffer, sterile filtration, aseptic filling, plunger-stopper placement and final assembly of the 
PFS and the PFP. Up to three active substance lots can be pooled together and mixed to reach the target 
batch size. The product is manufactured aseptically and the solution is passed though both a pre-filter and a 
sterile filter (both 0.22 µm).  
It is noted that the maximal times for buffer hold, active substance post thaw and filtered formulated finished 
product hold as listed in P.3.3 and validated in P.3.5 are significantly shorter than those in section P.2.3. For 
future extension of hold times it has been confirmed that the applicant will submit variation applications 
according to the existing EU classification guideline on variation applications.  
Initially only limited information was included about the assembly of the pen/auto-injector.  
 This was accepted based on an acceptable validation scheme for the Breda site.  The rationale for omission 
of a few specification tests has been acceptably justified. 
No reprocessing has been described in the dossier.  
Process controls 
The IPCs are deemed suitable for controlling and monitoring the manufacturing process.  
Two critical IPCs with action limits have been defined for bioburden, > 10 CFU/10 mL before the pre-filter 
and ≥ 1 CFU/10 mL before the sterile filter. It has been shown that the filters used during formulation and 
filling have excess filter capacity that exceeds the worst case microbial challenge. This justification is found 
acceptable together with a discussion comparing the probability of detecting a contamination with a 10 mL 
sample versus a 100 mL sample (with reference to the EBE position paper published, October 12, 2016).  
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 19/263 
  
  
Process validation 
The process validation studies described in the dossier comprise finished product process validation, 
sterilisation process validation, filter validation and transport validation.  
The process validation studies follow a traditional approach. Three consecutive commercial-scale batches 
were produced in September 2015. The bracketed approach for process validation with two batches at the 
minimum and one lot at the maximum batch size is found acceptable. All validation batches complied with 
the established in-process and release specifications, no critical deviations were observed.  
The aseptic filling has been sufficiently validated with media fills, and data is presented supporting the 
proposed hold time from start of sterilisation filtration to completion of syringe filling. Acceptable results from 
filter validation are presented including results for microbial retention capacity, extractables profile and 
chemical compatibility.  
Results from transport validation studies have been presented. Shipping containers used for transport are 
qualified to demonstrate that temperature is controlled for a pre-defined temperature range and duration. 
Finished product exposed to transport was analytically tested to confirm that quality attributes were 
maintained. The Company has a platform of qualified insulated shipping containers comprised of various sizes 
and durations. The applicant has confirmed that the shipping containers used during the simulation tests are 
representative of that used for actual shipping of the finished product. 
No new impurities are added during finished product manufacture. 
Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
Specifications 
The specifications for the finished product were presented and include control of identity, purity and 
impurities, potency and other general tests.  
Quality attribute acceptance criteria were established using a statistical data set comprising release testing 
results from finished product lots manufactured at the clinical site using the commercial finished product 
process, as well as stability data at the recommended storage conditions. This approach to set specification 
limits only based on statistical considerations including tolerance intervals was not fully acceptable.  
During the procedure, additional justification with respect to the clinical relevance and qualification of the 
shelf-life life limits for the purity parameters was asked for. The limits were further supported by the clinical 
use of higher doses than the proposed commercial dose (210 mg). This justification to maintain the active 
substance and finished product release and stability specifications for the purity assays can be accepted.  This 
is found acceptable.  
The initially proposed specification did not include certain tests. Such tests were included during the 
procedure.  
Analytical procedures and reference standards 
A comprehensive validation report for the rCE-SDS is provided. All other methods, except for the polysorbate 
20 method, are either identical to those used for analysis of active substance or compendial methods and the 
validation reports are deemed acceptable.  
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 20/263 
  
  
The specification for finished product was updated during the procedure with acceptance criteria for pH, 
osmolality and polysorbate 20 and a footnote “Complies if tested, controlled by real-time release testing 
(RTRT)”. This is acceptable.  
Batch analysis 
The batch analysis data presented for the three process verification batches complies with the limits in the 
proposed finished product specification. It is noted that results for potency, osmolality, pH and polysorbate 
20 content are included although these tests initially not were included in the proposed finished product 
specification.  
In conclusion, the batch analyses data demonstrates acceptable batch-to-batch consistency and 
reproducibility of the manufacturing process proposed for Evenity in pre-filled syringes and pre-filled pens.  
Reference standard 
The same reference standard(s) are used for both romosozumab active substance and finished product 
testing. 
Container closure 
The primary container closure consists of a 1 mL syringe with an insert moulded stainless steel needle 
covered with an elastomeric needle shield and a chlorobutyl elastomeric plunger stopper laminated with a 
FluroTec film on the product contact surface.  
Drawings for all parts of the PFS are provided and dimensions of the syringe barrel and the plunger-stopper 
are listed in this section of the dossier. Compliance to the requirements in Ph Eur monographs 3.2.2.1 (Plastic 
containers…), 3.1.3 (Polyolefins) and 3.2.9 (Rubber closures…) is demonstrated in section P.2.4 of the 
dossier. This information is found acceptable.  
Regarding the plastic syringe barrel, no detailed information about the composition of the plastic was 
included in the initial application. It was stated that it is durable, transparent, heat resistant and practically 
insoluble in most solvents. Additional information, in line with the requirements in Ph Eur 3.2.2 (Plastic 
container for pharmaceutical use) and the Guideline on Plastic Immediate Packaging Materials 
(CPMP/QWP/4359/03, EMEA/CVMP/205/04 was provided as response to a CHMP request. This is found 
acceptable. 
Results from studies of elemental impurities in accordance with ICH Q3D were presented. No issue was 
identified. 
Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life for the finished product is 3 years when stored at 2 – 8°C, with an optional short-term 
storage at room temperature (up to 25°C) for up to 30 days in the original container. If not used within this 
period, the product should be discarded. The PFP and PFS should be kept in the outer carton in order to 
protect from light. 
The stability studies were performed per ICH Q5C for Biotechnological/Biological Products and ICH Q1A for 
New Active substances and Products.  
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 21/263 
  
  
The testing and reporting for the nine finished product batches included in the stability studies are still 
ongoing and an overview of the data obtained thus far is presented in the dossier. The study is on-going for 
up to 48 months.  
The three primary stability lots were manufactured at the clinical scale manufacturing site (ATO) and the 
three process verification batches were manufactured at the commercial scale manufacturing site (Patheon, 
Italia), both using active substance from Process 2. The ATO process is considered representative of 
commercial production and the product has been shown to be comparable to commercial production. The 
three supporting stability lots were manufactured using active substance at clinical scale at the ATO 
manufacturing site. For the three process verification batches manufactured at the commercial manufacturing 
site, up to 30 months data are available.  
At long term storage all test parameters remained within the specification limits and no significant changes 
were observed for any of the parameters tested for up to 48 months storage at 2-8ºC. During accelerated 
and stressed storage the primary degradation pathways for romosozumab were shown.   
Results from studies evaluating moisture permeability for the plastic syringe are presented in section P.2.4 of 
the dossier. These results indicate that the water loss in both long term and accelerated conditions will be far 
less than the significant change of 5% described in ICH Q1A (R2). The lack of control of protein concentration 
during the stability studies is considered as acceptably justified.  
While it is noted that functionality test for the PFS were characterised during design verification, no test has 
been included in the release specification. However, since the applicant has demonstrated on three lots (with 
repeated testing) that PFS functionality is unaltered during the 36 months shelf life, the lack of a release test 
is found acceptable.  
For the purity parameters that show change over time, detailed information about the statistical analysis of 
the long-term stability data have been presented in line with ICH Q1E Guideline.  
. However, the statistical evaluation of the stability data shown that all purity parameters have predicted 
expiry results well beyond the 36 month proposed expiry also when the proposed short term storage at room 
temperature are included.  
The proposed shelf life and storage conditions are considered acceptable. 
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines (6.32 of Vol. 4 Part I of the Rules Governing Medicinal products in the 
European Union), any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported 
to the EMA. 
Post approval change management protocol(s) 
The applicant has provided a Post-Approval Change Management Protocol (PACMP) for extension of the in-
process pool hold times during the manufacturing of active substance in support of classification of future 
applications for extensions of in-process hold times as Type IB variations. The PACMP is found acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No material of biological origin (except the CHO production cell line) is used during manufacture. A TSE 
certificate has been provided for the FBS used during development of the MCB. The risk of TSE transmission 
is deemed negligible. The information provided is acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020

The viral testing of the MCB, WCB and limit of in vitro cell age (LIVCA) has been performed in compliance 
with ICH Q5A. No viral contamination was detected with the exception of the expected A-type and C-type 
retrovirus-like particles. Sufficient detailed information has been provided for the test methods used.  
Unprocessed bulk is tested for adventitious agents using in vitro tests. Four different cell lines are used, MRC-
5, Vero cells, CHO-K1 and 324K cells. The detection limit of the 324K in vitro method have been 
demonstrated to be sufficiently sensitive in detecting minute virus of mice (MMV) to ensure a safety margin 
for the finished product (in combination with the reduction factor demonstrated for MMV in the process).  
Both dedicated viral reduction steps in the manufacturing process (viral inactivation by low pH and virus 
filtration) and three chromatography steps (Protein A chromatography, cation exchange chromatography and 
mixed-mode anion exchange chromatography) have been validated for virus removal or inactivation. The 
results from virus studies demonstrate that substantial clearance is achieved for viruses having a wide range 
of physicochemical properties in the romosozumab process.  
Acceptable information has been provided for the virus clearance studies and the data shows effective 
reduction of a wide range of model viruses. The virus clearance studies have been performed in compliance 
with ICH Q5A and CPMP/BWP/268/95. Data supporting the relevance of the down-scaled process steps as 
models for the commercial process has been presented in sufficient detail. The results provided also support 
the claimed viral clearance throughout the resin lifetime for each of the chromatography steps. Information 
regarding the validation of virus removal in the nanofiltration step has been provided demonstrating robust 
removal of small non-enveloped viruses such as MMV. Furthermore, information on the quantitative 
polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) method used to calculate clearance data for murine xenotropic leukemia 
virus-related virus (xMuLV) and pseudorabies virus (PRV) at the Protein A chromatography step has been 
provided. 
In addition, acceptable safety margin has been demonstrated for retrovirus-like particles for the Evenity 
process.   
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Active substance 
The manufacturing process of active substance is adequately described, validated and controlled with a 
sufficient level of details included also covering target set limits and acceptable ranges for the critical process 
parameters as well as in-process controls for each process-step.  
The MCB and WCB are properly tested and qualified. Romosozumab was thoroughly characterised to provide 
a comprehensive understanding of its structural and functional properties. The characterisation included 
biochemical, biophysical, biological and forced degradation studies.  
The proposed shelf-life for romosozumab active substance of 60 months at -30 °C is found acceptable.  
Finished product 
An acceptable overview is provided on the development of the formulation, including satisfactory data 
supporting the composition of the commercial finished product. The manufacturing process, limited to active 
substance thawing, formulation, sterile filtration and aseptic filling, has been acceptably described and 
validated.  
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 23/263 
  
  
The information provided for the delivery devices, the pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen, is comprehensive, 
and confirms the suitability of the chosen devices. Design verification was performed and compliance with  
essential requirements has been demonstrated.  
The justification of specification for the purity parameters are supported by the clinical use of higher doses 
compared to the commercial dose (210 mg). The proposed shelf-life limits for the purity parameters are 
considered to be clinically qualified.  
Data presented support the proposed shelf-life for the finished product of 3 years when stored at  
2 – 8 °C and with an optional short-term storage at room temperature of not more than 30 days.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
In conclusion, based on the review of the quality data provided, the marketing authorisation application for 
Evenity is approvable from a quality point of view. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following point for investigation: 
1. The applicant is recommended to provide the final validation report for the commercial automated pen 
assembly 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
Romosozumab is a humanized monoclonal immunoglobulin (IgG2) that binds and inhibits sclerostin, a 
negative regulator of canonical Wnt signalling in cells of the osteoblast lineage and bone formation, which has 
been developed for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men at increased risk for 
fractures. A number of binding and cellular in vitro studies as well as in vivo studies have been conducted to 
characterize the pharmacological activity of romosozumab.   
Primary pharmacodynamics 
In vitro studies 
In vitro binding studies showed that romosozumab binds with high affinity to both human and rodent and 
non-rodent sclerostin. 
The affinity for rat and cynomolgus monkey sclerostin (KD of 3 pM and 23 pM, respectively) was slightly 
higher and lower, respectively, than for human sclerostin (KD of 11 pM). 
Investigation of the effects of romosozumab on binding of sclerostin to LRPs showed that romosozumab 
blocked the binding of human sclerostin to the closely related key Wnt signalling co-receptors LRP5 and LRP6, 
but not the binding of human sclerostin to LRP4, thought to play a facilitator role in sclerostin’s inhibitory 
effect on Wnt signalling. This is considered mechanistically sufficient to block sclerostin’s inhibitory activity 
and allow for the increases in bone formation and bone mineral density observed with administration of 
romosozumab in vivo.

In a study of mineralization in a mouse osteoblast cell line (MC3T3-E1-BF), romosozumab concentrations 
from 10 µg/ml was shown to inhibit the inhibitory effect on mineralization induced by 1 µg/ml human, 
cynomolgus, rat, and mouse sclerostin. Sclerostin is thought to inhibit the differentiation of osteoblasts to a 
mineralization phenotype. The statistically significant results obtained in this cell-based model of bone 
formation indicate that romosozumab is likely to have bone building activity in vivo.   
In vivo studies 
Romosozumab in female bone depleted rats and monkeys 
Weekly subcutaneous injection of romosozumab at 3, 10, or 50 mg/kg to skeletally mature, bone depleted 
ovariectomized (OVX) rats and at 3 and 30 mg/kg to aged bone depleted OVX cynomolgus monkeys for 12 
months resulted in a rapid and dose-dependent net positive bone balance with formation exceeding 
resorption and increases in cortical and cancellous (trabecular) bone mass and enhanced bone geometry from 
a dose level of 3 mg/kg.  
Bone mass levels equalled or exceeded pre-OVX levels within the first 3 months of the dosing phase. By the 
end of the dosing phase at Week 52, bone mass generally exceeded both OVX and sham vehicle controls with 
e.g. increases in total bone mineral density (BMD) compared to OVX vehicle controls in rats and monkeys in 
femur, in lumbar spine and in proximal tibia metaphysis.  
By the end of the dosing phase at Week 52, bone mass generally exceeded both OVX and sham vehicle 
controls with e.g. increases in total bone mineral density (BMD) compared to OVX vehicle controls in rats and 
monkeys of up to 53% and 29%, respectively, in femur, 61% and 29%, respectively, in lumbar spine and 30 
40% and 28%, respectively, in proximal tibia metaphysis.   
At all time points and doses, romosozumab significantly increased total slice area at the proximal tibia 
metaphysis and tibial diaphyseal cortical thickness compared to OVX controls. 
The dose-dependent gains in bone mass in romosozumab treated rats and monkeys were associated with 
proportionally greater bone strength at the lumbar spine, femoral neck, and femur diaphysis consistent with 
proximal tibia and vertebral increased bone volume, mineralized volume and trabecular thickness, indicating 
that bone quality was maintained or improved. 
Aorta mineralization in the romosozumab treated cynomolgus monkeys was investigated by radiological 
methods. No evidence of mineralization of aorta was observed at the end of a 52-week treatment or at 
recovery 26 weeks after end of a 26-week treatment. 
Some reversal of the romosozumab-related changes in bone mass, geometry and biomechanical strength 
parameters was observed after a 26-week recovery following a 26-week treatment period at 30 mg/kg. 
The highest mean serum concentrations of romosozumab obtained in rats at the 3, 10 and 50 mg/kg dose 
levels were 1.6-fold, 8.6-fold and 42.3-fold, respectively, the steady-state Cmax of approximately 28.1 μg/mL 
obtained in patients at the recommended dose of 210 mg. In monkeys the mean romosozumab AUC0-tau x 4 
(to represent exposure for 1 month) was 688 and 11 800 μg·day/mL at 3 and 30 mg/kg, respectively, 
equivalent to 16512 and 283200 μg·h/mL which is 1.4-fold and 23.2-fold-fold the AUC0-tau of 12216  μg·hr/mL 
obtained in patients. Thus, the exposure levels in the OVX rats and monkeys treated for 12 months covered 
the clinical exposure and up 36-fold and 23-fold multiples of the clinical exposure, respectively.  
In a second study in aged bone-depleted OVX cynomolgus monkeys, weekly subcutaneous injection of 
romosozumab at 3 mg/kg for 26 weeks resulted in rapid increases in cortical and cancellous (trabecular) 
bone mass. Increases in bone mass over time were related to an early increase in bone formation.

Cortical BMD at the distal radial metaphysis and diaphysis showed a minimal decrease with treatment. 
Despite the decrease in radial BMD, increased cortical activation frequency during the second half of the 
study, covariate analysis of BMC and biomechanical parameters obtained at the end of the study 
demonstrated that radial bone strength was maintained by romosozumab. 
Romosozumab in male monkeys with fibular or ulnar osteotomy 
Bi-weekly subcutaneous administration of romosozumab at 30 mg/kg for 10 weeks following bilateral fibular 
osteotomy in male adolescent cynomolgus monkeys significantly increased BMD at the lumbar spine, femur, 
distal radius and proximal tibia (up to 23% of osteotomy controls [lumbar spine]) primarily by effects on 
trabecular bone, attributed to increases in trabecular thickness (up to 1.5-fold of osteotomy controls [lumbar 
spine]). For cortical bone, treatment with romosozumab induced significantly increased bone geometry (e.g. 
increased cortical thickness) only at the distal radius. Increases in BMD at the lumbar spine were translated 
to increased bone strength (up to 70% of osteotomy controls). Increases in bone mass and 
trabecular/cortical thickness were associated with increased biochemical bone turnover markers (both 
formation [osteocalcin and procollagen type 1 N telopeptide] and resorption [C-telopeptide]) and bone 
formation rates observed by histomorphometry. 
Romosozumab treatment significantly increased fracture callus bone mineral content relative to osteotomy 
controls associated with a lower incidence of delayed/non-union, reduced gap width between bone ends, 
more abundant bone within the osteotomy gap and less chondral tissue and fibrovascular/ granulation tissue 
in the callus. The increased callus bone mass was associated with a significant increase in torsional stiffness 
(48%) and non-significant increases in maximum torque (32%) and AUC (38%) compared to osteotomy 
controls. 
The mean trough serum romosozumab concentrations ranged from 36 to 60 μg/mL which is approximately 
1.1 to 1.8-fold the steady-state Cmax of approximately 33 μg/mL obtained in patients. 
In another study, bi-weekly subcutaneous administration of romosozumab at 30 mg/kg during 10 and 28 
weeks following bilateral fibular osteotomy and ulnar osteotomy, respectively, in male adolescent cynomolgus 
monkeys resulted in increased modelling based bone formation, increased final wall thickness (W.Th) at 
remodelling sites, decreased eroded surface (ES/BS) in vertebral cancellous bone, and increased periosteal 
and endocortical bone formation in the vertebral cortex. These effects are proposed to contribute to the early 
increase in spine BMD observed with the romosozumab treatment. Following the self-regulation of bone 
formation with continued treatment, a decrease in remodelling space secondary to reduced ES/BS and a 
positive bone balance secondary to decreased final resorption depth (Rs.De) and increased W.Th contribute 
to the progressive increase in spine BMD. 
Surrogate antibody r13C7 in bone depleted rats  
Weekly subcutaneous injection of r13C7 at 25 mg/kg to skeletally mature, bone depleted OVX rats for 26 
weeks resulted in continuously increased bone mass and bone strength of vertebrate (up to 80%) and non-
vertebrate bones (up to 40%) compared to OVX controls up to end of dosing, with bone formation increases 
that peaked early and returned toward control levels over time. Bone resorption as reflected in serum 
biomarkers, histomorphometric parameters at trabecular and cortical sites of vertebrate and non-vertebrate 
bones, and reduced ex vivo osteoclastogenesis was decreased compared to OVX controls. 
Treatment with r13C7 significantly increased expression of genes coding for Wnt inhibitors (sost, dkk1, mepe, 
and dmp1) through 26 weeks at the vertebra, and at some time points at the tibia, indicating that 
romosozumab induced bone formation is self-regulated.

EMA/26554/2020

In another study, retreatment of OVX rats with twice weekly subcutaneous injections of 5 mg/kg r137C for 6 
weeks following an initial 6-week treatment phase and a treatment-free 12-week withdrawal period resulted 
in increased bone formation (e.g. trabecular and cortical bone formation rates [BFR/BS]) and BMD and 
decreased bone resorption (e.g. trabecular ES/BS) at the lumbar spine and femur-tibia to the levels observed 
during the initial treatment phase. 
In a third study, retreatment of OVX rats with twice weekly subcutaneous injections of 5 mg/kg r137C for 6 
weeks following an initial 12-week treatment phase with r137C and a 12-week treatment phase with twice 
weekly subcutaneous injections of 10 mg/kg osteoprotegerin (OPG-Fc, a RANKL inhibitor) did not further 
increase the BMD at the lumbar spine and femur after the initial treatment period with r137C and the 
maintenance of BMD with OPG-Fc which indicate self-regulation of r13c7-induced increase in bone formation.  
In a fourth study, pre- and co-treatment with alendronate (subcutaneous injections of 28 µg/kg twice weekly 
for 6 weeks) did not have any significant effect on the increased bone formation, bone mass, and bone 
strength induced by once weekly subcutaneous injections of 25 mg/kg r137C for 6 weeks.  
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
In addition to its effects in animal models of osteoporosis, sclerostin antibodies (Scl-Ab) have also been 
tested in other animal bone loss models. Repeated administration of Scl-Ab (r13c7 25 mg/kg, SC or 10 
mg/kg, IP) up to 6 weeks was effective in increasing bone formation and preventing the disease-associated 
decrease in bone mass and strength in models of androgen ablation (osteopenia), inflammation, and skeletal 
disuse/unloading.   
In a rodent fracture repair model, Scl-Ab (r13c7, 25 mg/kg, SC) administered for 9 weeks was shown to 
increase bone mass in the fracture callus, resulting in improvements in functional strength.  
As expression of sclerostin has been reported in chondrocytes, the effects of both systemic Scl-Ab (r13c7, 25 
mg/kg, SC) as well as local (intraarticular) administration of smaller FAB fragment of Scl-Ab (385 µg in 50µL, 
IA) were tested in the rat medial meniscal tear (MMT) model of osteoarthritis (OA). The results from these 
two studies did not indicate a significant effect of Scl-Ab on the progression of induced osteoarthritis following 
3 weeks of treatment. However, a trend to increased severity of MMT-induced osteoarthritis was observed 
after systemic administration of Scl-Ab as evident by decrease in the percent area of any cartilage matrix 
(54% inhibition, p=0.07) which in turn is a sign of greater degeneration.  
Whereas the precise role of sclerostin in the development and progression of OA is still unclear, the overall 
results from nonclinical studies and clinical safety data, where adverse advents of osteoarthritis were 
balanced between romosozumab and control groups, indicate that osteoarthritis would be of low potential risk 
in connection with romosozumab treatment. 
Theoretical concerns regarding the effects of sclerostin antibodies 
The applicant has provided a comprehensive theoretical discussion on the possible secondary pharmacological 
effects of sclerostin antibodies and its subsequent activation of Wnt signalling, with possible safety concerns 
that could be identified, are summarised and discussed below. 
Vascular calcification 
Sclerostin is an inhibitor of mineralization in bone, related to its effects on osteoblast differentiation. Because 
sclerostin is constitutively expressed in the aorta and in vascular calcified foci, there is a theoretical concern 
that inhibition of sclerostin by romosozumab may promote or exacerbate vascular calcification (VC). The 
potential association of sclerostin with VC has been suggested in by a number of published studies in animals 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 27/263 
  
  
and in man. Sclerostin mRNA and protein levels are upregulated in calcified aortas in transgenic animals 
(Enpp1 knockout mice) in vivo as well as in calcifying murine vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) in vitro. 
Sclerostin expression has also been shown to increase in calcified human aorta valves and in most, but not 
all, cross-sectional observational studies, circulating sclerostin levels positively associates with cardiovascular 
calcification. In addition, recent data indicate that sclerostin overexpression may protect the aorta from 
atherosclerosis and inflammation in animals (Krishna et al. 2013, 2017). Thus, these findings together with 
the constitutive expression of SOST protein in calcifying vascular tissues support a potential role of sclerostin 
in limiting calcification not only in bone but also in the vasculature.  
Even though there were no effects of romosozumab on cardiovascular function in the repeat dose toxicity 
studies in intact animals, romosozumab treatment increased the rate of serious cardiovascular adverse 
events in clinical trials. The applicant did not provide data on the effect of prolonged romosozumab treatment 
on vascular calcification in normal and diseased vasculature such as in the atherosclerosis mouse model. As 
such, it is not clear, if a sclerostin specific antibody would possibly amplify the atherosclerotic effects. The 
applicant was initially asked to further address this safety issue. This should include providing clarifying 
information on the suggested protective role of sclerostin in vascular calcification and a discussion about the 
effect of a sclerostin antibody on promoting atherosclerosis and its possible cardiovascular safety 
consequences using study data (e.g. mechanistic studies in vitro and/or in vivo) or published literature. The 
applicant has provided a comprehensive response in order to clarify the suggested protective role of 
sclerostin in vascular calcification in diseased tissue and the effect of sclerostin inhibition on promotion of 
atherosclerosis. The Applicant´s responses included the submission of five new non-clinical studies including 
in vivo studies in an atherosclerosis disease model (high fat diet-fed ApoE -/- mice). Romosozumab, or its 
ratized antibody form had no apparent effects on vascular calcification in healthy normal animals as 
discussed in the previous round of the MAA submission. The data provided from the in vivo study in a disease 
model (study 124609) using high fat diet-fed ovariectomized ApoE knock-out mice (study 124609) showed 
that sclerostin inhibition by the anti-sclerostin antibody r13C7 had no effect on aortic total plaque volume or 
mineralized plaque volume or no change in inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such MCP-1, IL-6, TNFα, 
(although these were affected by the ApoE -/- genotype per se) or in genes associated with matrix 
degradation and calcification, such as Mmp-9, Spp1 or TNfrsf11b.  
Sclerostin expression studies by immunohistochemistry in advanced human atherosclerotic plaque suggests 
that sclerostin was not expressed in most of the advanced human atherosclerotic plaques (77%) and showed 
no apparent association with patient medical history of artery disease or with cardiovascular outcome during 
the 3-year follow up period. In those cases where sclerostin was detected, this was restricted to deeper parts 
of the plaque/vessel wall (T. median and adjacent T. intima) and was of decreased intensity compared to 
control aorta. Sclerostin expression was never seen in the superficial region of the plaques next to the vessel 
lumen. The only association between absence of sclerostin expression and plaque features was dystrophic 
calcification occurring in necrotic acellular areas of human carotid artery atherosclerotic plaques. This is more 
likely a consequence of the advanced nature of the plaque, reflecting passive calcification, rather than a 
direct functional association with calcification 
Additionally, there was no obvious relationship between plaque OPN level or the presence of the pro-
inflammatory cytokines MCP-1, IL-6 and TNFα. Thus, these data indicate that sclerostin is not likely to affect 
advanced plaque biology to a large extent. Further contribution for the absence of a mechanistic link between 
sclerostin and atherosclerosis is derived from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Human genetic data 
showed that a natural genetic modulation of SOST expression in aorta and tibial artery by a common SNP 
(allele C of the SNP rs2741856) in human populations had a significant effect on bone physiology but no 
detectable effect on risk of myocardial infarction or stroke. Evidence for increased thrombogenesis (as a

component of plaque rupture and erosion) was examined by studying dysregulation of prostanoid metabolism 
and platelet activation. In these studies, romosozumab did not induce platelet activation in human whole 
blood at up to 300μg/mL which is a concentration approximately 10-fold greater than the clinical Cmax. 
Vasospasm (as functional alteration in coronary circulation with vasoconstriction and acute changes in blood 
pressure (flow) as mediator) was studied on isolated healthy human coronary arteries. Romosozumab (or 
human recombinant sclerostin) did not induce vasoconstriction at concentrations up to 300μg/mL which is a 
concentration approximately 10-fold greater than clinical Cmax at 210 mg QM. 
During the procedure, EMA and CHMP had been made aware of, as a third party intervention, an article by 
Jonas Bovijn et al (Lifelong genetically lowered sclerostin and risk of cardiovascular disease), pre-published 
online on BioRxiv (doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/531004) as a manuscript in preprint and not yet peer-
reviewed.  
The scope of the article was to investigate the potential cardiovascular risk of sclerostin suppression by gene 
analysis and to compare the results from a meta-analysis of the published data from the romosozumab Phase 
III studies.  
The authors identified two SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) in a region indicated to affect express ion 
of the SOST gene, encoding for sclerostin, in human bone. Mutations in or close to this this region has been 
associated with Van Buchem disease, characterised by decreased levels of sclerostin. Thus, subjects with 
point mutations identified by the SNPs are presumed by the authors to have low sclerostin levels. The 
authors estimated the effects on risk of e.g. osteoporosis, fracture and coronary heart disease (CHD), by 
combining data from up to 478,967 participants of European ancestry from three prospective cohorts and up 
to 1,030,836 participants from nine genome-wide association study (GWAS) consortia.  
In summary,  subjects identified by the SNP displayed higher risk of myocardial infarction and/or coronary 
revascularisation (69,649 cases; OR 1.18; 95% CI, 1.06-1.32; P=0.003) and type 2 diabetes (OR 1.15; 95% 
CI, 1.05-1.27; P=0.003), higher systolic blood pressure (1.3mmHg; 95% CI 0.8-1.9; P=5.9×10-6) and 
waist-to-hip-ratio adjusted for BMI (0.05 SDs; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.08; P=8·5×10-4) but with lower risk of 
fracture (OR 0.59; 95% CI, 0.54-0.66; P= 1.4×10-24), and osteoporosis (OR 0.43; 95% CI, 0.36-0.52; 
P=2·4×10-18). 
The CHMP identified some weaknesses with the study. The SNPs of choice are downstream of the target gene 
(>30kb). While the DNA region containing the SNPs is likely of importance to the target gene expression, the 
exact relation between the two chosen SNPs and the target gene expression is not as well established. The 
association between the chosen SNPs and BMD was weaker in some populations, and it is considered that the 
possibility of genetic pleiotropy has not been fully accounted for.  
In the view of the CHMP, the data presented in the article suggest a potential mechanism for sclerostin in the 
development of cardiovascular disease. The results may be indicative of an increased CV risk with low levels 
of sclerostin; however, the data are not considered conclusive. 
Cancer  
Because romosozumab is a bone-forming agent and an activator of canonical Wnt signalling, questions 
regarding carcinogenic risk have been raised. These concerns arise from the association of mutations in the 
canonical Wnt pathways with human cancers through activating mutations or epigenetic changes in the 
intracellular signalling components or experimental overexpression of Wnt ligands where hyperplasia is 
followed by neoplasia.

Chronic hormonal perturbation is a risk for tumorigenesis in rats that may or may not always translate to 
humans. Hormonal signals are major players in regulating sclerostin expression in osteocytes (Suen et al. 
2015) with androgens and estrogens inhibiting Sost expression (Delgado-Calle et al. 2016). The applicant 
was requested to elaborate if a reversal effect of an increase in androgens or estrogens occurs after anti-
sclerostin treatment and to which degree this could present a risk for carcinogenicity (i.e. oestrogen 
dependent cancers) in humans. An evaluation of all the nonclinical data did not provide any evidence that 
chronic treatment with romosozumab is associated with any effects in male or female reproductive organs or 
sex hormone levels. In addition, there was no evidence of an increased incidence in neoplasia in the 
reproductive organs in the lifetime rat pharmacology study. Thus, romosozumab treatment is unlikely to pose 
an increased risk of sex hormone-related carcinogenicity in humans. 
In the lifetime rat pharmacology study (study 107895) two osteosarcomas were observed at 50 mg/kg in 
male rats (incidence was 3.7% vs. historical average incidence of 0.38%; range 0-3.33%). In the literature 
there are reports of overexpression of Wnt signalling components in osteosarcoma and silencing of sclerostin 
expression in an osteosarcoma cell lines using si-RNA resulted in enhanced Wnt signalling, increased 
proliferation and invasion in vitro. 
Aberrantly high canonical Wnt signalling has been implicated in the development and /or maintenance of 
many cancers including colorectal, prostate, lung, breast and bone cancers, but elevated WNT signalling may 
not correlate with reduced patient survival in all types of cancer. As WNT signalling appears to promote 
tumour initiation, growth, and generation of metastases in a cancer-type-specific manner, the mechanistic 
link between sclerostin inhibition and the risk of cancer as well as the osteosarcomas observed in the rat 
carcinogenicity study has been discussed by the applicant with regard to the long-term clinical safety of 
romosozumab treatment (see toxicology section). 
Hyperostosis  
Hyperostosis (increased bone mass resulting in altered bone size and/or shape) with adverse neurological 
consequences is a feature of patients with loss-of-function mutation in sclerostin (i.e. sclerosteosis and van 
Buchem disease). Theoretical considerations for potential bone overgrowth or hyperostosis occurring with 
romosozumab treatment have, thus, been raised. Preclinical toxicity data in rat and monkeys suggest dose-
dependent increases in bone mass following chronic treatment with romosozumab (≥ 3 mg/kg, SC) but 
hyperostosis was only evident in the rat, consistent with the pharmacologic activity of the antibody. The 
severity of the hyperostosis appeared to be increased in female rats as compared to males in the “1-month 
Subcutaneous Injection Toxicity Study of AMG 785 in the Sprague Dawley Rat With a 10–week Recovery 
Period” (Study 105908). The Applicant is asked to interpret this gender difference and discuss the possible 
cause for this finding (see details in the toxicology part). 
There were no obvious adverse neurological consequences due to nerve compression observed in rats and 
monkeys based on assessment of clinical scores, food consumption, ophthalmologic examinations, 
electrocardiogram, blood pressure measurements and macroscopic or microscopic examination of the brain, 
spinal cord, sciatic nerve, and optic nerve. In addition, the current clinical trial data indicate that 
romosozumab at the clinical dose of 210 QM for 1 year was not associated with hyperostosis.  
Sacropenia 
In some recent non-clinical studies, a reduced muscle weight has been reported in Sost knock-out mice. 
Sarcopenia is, however, not a feature of patients with loss-of-function mutation in sclerostin (i.e. 
sclerosteosis and van Buchem disease). Moreover, inhibition of sclerostin with Scl-Ab did not appear to affect 
skeletal muscle mass in rats and no gross observations were recorded for muscle mass in rats exposed for up 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 30/263 
  
  
to 98 weeks at 50 mg/kg romosozumab. In addition, the available clinical data including HRpQCT Imaging do 
not give strong support that clinically significant sarcopenia would be a potential risk with romosozumab 
treatment.  
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) 
ONJ is a condition characterized by necrotic exposed bone in the maxillofacial region and there is a strong 
association of ONJ with suppression of bone turnover. In patients with sclerosteosis, who have a lifelong 
absence of sclerostin due to loss-of-function mutations, there appears to be no reported cases with ONJ. 
Moreover, dental disease and inflammation in rats with lifetime romosozumab exposure was not associated 
with ONJ-like findings. Osteonecrosis of the jaw is, however, a known AEs associated with longer term 
exposure of antiresorptive drugs. In the current clinical safety evaluation, four cases of ONJ have occurred in 
romosozumab clinical programme (one during romosozumab treatment and three when romosozumab was 
followed by denosumab or alendronate treatment). This information should be included in the SmPC 
document (see Clinical section). 
Atypical femoral fracture (AFF) 
Based on the mode of action of romosozumab and because inhibition of bone resorption is a component of 
the dual effect of romosozumab, there is a potential concern for increased risk of promoting atypical femoral 
fractures (AFFs). In an animal model of fracture healing after fibular osteotomy, romosozumab (30 mg/kg 
2QM) did not affect the degree of cortical porosity within the fibular cortex near the site of osteotomy after 
10 weeks. However, in the clinical safety evaluation, there was one subject in the romosozumab group, and 
no placebo subject had a positively adjudicated case of AFF in the 12-month placebo-controlled population. 
Based on the mechanism of action of romosozumab it is therefore reasonable to conclude that romosozumab 
treatment has contributed to the AFF events that occurred in the clinical programme and that this risk should 
be considered as an identified risk for romosozumab and appropriate information should be included in the 
SmPC document (see Clinical section). 
Exacerbation of TNF-α-driven inflammatory diseases 
Expression of sclerostin in synoviocytes from patients with RA and hTNF-α transgenic (hTNFtg) mice suggest 
a role of sclerostin as a negative regulator of TNF-α production in the synovium. Some non-clinical studies, 
but not all, indicate that administration of a Scl-Ab to hTNFtg mice exacerbated joint destruction, which in 
turn has raised concerns that administration of romosozumab may exacerbate disease in patient with TNF-α 
driven comorbidities. However, the overall current clinical trial data set do not indicate that TNF-mediated 
inflammatory adverse events would be a potential risk with romosozumab treatment. In the ongoing clinical 
trials subjects having potential TNF-α-comorbidities will be monitored for effects of romosozumab on disease 
exacerbation. 
Haematopoiesis 
Because romosozumab-mediated effects on bone formation occur through regulation of the osteoblast 
lineage, effects on haematopoiesis are a theoretical concern. As a consequence of the intended 
pharmacological activity of romosozumab, to increase canonical Wnt signalling in stromal cells and the 
osteoblast lineage, reversible hematologic changes including significant decreases in mean red cell numbers 
were seen in rats and to a smaller extent in cynomolgus monkeys administered romosozumab 
subcutaneously up to 100 mg/kg for 26 weeks. The available clinical trial data indicate that romosozumab at 
210 mg QM for 1 year has no apparent effect on haematopoiesis.

Glucose metabolism 
Studies in rodents indicate a potential role of bone in regulation of glucose metabolism mediated through 
serum OCN, which romosozumab increases through its effect on bone formation. In repeat-dose toxicity 
studies in rats administered romosozumab at doses up to 300 mg/kg QW, a significant and dose-dependent 
increases in fasting blood glucose was observed in males (about 24% at 300 mg/kg, SC) and in females (19 
% at 100 mg/kg, SC). In contrast to rats, in repeat-dose studies in cynomolgus monkeys administered doses 
of up to 300 mg/kg IV QW and SC with exposures up to 200-fold greater than the clinical exposure at 210 
mg QM, respectively, showed no significant changes or patterns in fasting glucose. The clinical trials indicate 
that romosozumab treatment had no significant effects on fasting glucose. Thus, preclinical data in 
cynomolgus monkeys and clinical data indicate that romosozumab should not have major effects glucose 
metabolism.  
Safety pharmacology 
Safety pharmacology endpoints were evaluated in a single dose neurobehavioral study in rat and in a single 
dose combined cardiovascular/respiratory study in cynomolgus monkey. In addition, the effect of 
romosozumab on cardiovascular function (ECG and blood pressure) in monkeys was assessed in the 1-month 
repeat dose toxicity study at doses up to 300 mg/kg SC and IV and in the 6-month repeat dose toxicology 
study at dose up to 100 mg/kg SC. The applicant did not submit any in vitro safety studies such as hERG 
channel testing. This is acceptable considering the nature of the drug product (a monoclonal antibody). 
No adverse neurobehavioral or respiratory effects were observed in rat or cynomolgus monkey safety 
pharmacology studies administered romosozumab with exposure margins at NOAEL (300 mg/kg) exceeding 
200-fold to the clinical exposure (Cmax) at the 210 mg dose. 
In the single dose cardiovascular safety pharmacology study in cynomolgus monkey, a significant 
romosozumab-related increase in heart rate and blood pressure was observed at multiple occasions at the 
high dose (300 mg/kg, IV) with drug plasma concentration > 200-fold greater than the clinical exposure at 
the recommended 210 mg dose. The effect of on heart rate and blood pressure after a high single IV dose in 
monkeys is of uncertain etiology but it may be the result of a direct effect on the cardiovascular system by 
romosozumab. Nevertheless, the exposure margin at NOAEL (100 mg/kg; IV) in monkeys after single 
intravenous dosing was estimated to be ∼ 60-fold to clinical Cmax (33 µg/mL).  
In addition, safety pharmacology evaluations were also incorporated within the 4-week and 6-month repeat-
dose toxicity studies in monkeys. The results of these studies indicate that romosozumab had no effect on 
cardiovascular (blood pressure, heart rate, ECGs, QT/QTc) functions after subcutaneous dosing with exposure 
margins exceeding 200-fold to the clinical exposure. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No dedicated pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were conducted with romosozumab. This is 
acceptable for an antibody product. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of romosozumab (also referred to as AMG 785) were evaluated in rats 
and monkeys after intravenously or subcutaneous administration of one or two doses. Rodent versions of 
romosozumab were used in rat pharmacology and PK/PD studies, including rat 137c (r13c7) and mouse 13c7 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 32/263 
  
  
(m13c7). The toxicokinetic (TK) properties after multiple subcutaneous dosing were evaluated in the 
toxicology studies performed in rats, rabbits, and monkeys. 
Methods 
Romosozumab 
Specific analytical methods were developed to quantify romosozumab in rat, rabbit, and monkey sera using 
ELISA-based methods for each species. The applicant provided validation reports for the analytical methods 
used, demonstrating suitability of the methods for the purpose of analysis.  
The principle of the method is, in brief, that microplate wells are coated with mouse α-hu-AMG 785, 
monoclonal antibody that is used as a capture reagent. The captured AMG 785 is detected with a horseradish 
peroxidase (HRP) labeled mouse α-hu-AMG 785 monoclonal antibody. In GLP-safety studies, serum 
romosozumab concentrations in rat and cynomolgus monkey were determined with a lower limit of 
quantification of 50-875 ng/mL. 
None of the method validations applied in pivotal toxicity studies were formally performed under GLP.  It is 
acknowledged that some of the studies are performed according to GLP principles, e.g. QA audit of different 
steps of the study. The classification of the studies as non-GLP is not considered to have any impact on the 
results from the studies. 
Some unclarities were noted regarding the bioanalysis method used before the final bioanalytical method was 
set. Regarding the study in rat with the rodent version (m13C7) no description of the assay method was 
found although referred to in the report as “The bioanalytical memo report”. In the exploratory studies in 
Cynomolgus monkeys both studies (105779 and 105876) were stated to be analysed with immobilized 
biotinylated recombinant human sclerostin as a capturing reagent. The study report for study 105779 
however describes the method where the mouse anti human-AMG785 antibody is used. None of these issues 
are considered to influence the nonclinical evaluation of the product, and no action is thus needed.  
Neutralizing antibodies 
Specific analytical methods were developed to quantify neutralizing anti-romosozumab antibodies in rat and 
monkey sera. Two assays were developed, a binding antibody assay to detect antibodies capable of binding 
to romosozumab, and a neutralizing antibody assay to determine the neutralizing activity against 
romosozumab. Binding anti-romosozumab antibodies (ADA, Anti-drug antibody) were detected using a 
validated electrochemiluminescent (ECL) bridging immunoassay. The assay sensitivity is 3.9 ng/mL in rat and 
1.95 ng/mL in cynomolgus monkey. If positive for binding antibodies, the neutralizing activity of these 
samples was assessed in a validated ECL-based competitive target binding assay. The sensitivity in this assay 
is 0.75 µg/mL in both rat and monkey.  
The presence of romosozumab in serum may interfere with the assay sensitivity for ADA detection (>10 
µg/mL) and neutralizing antibody detection (>0.06 µg/mL) therefore, exposures must be interpreted with 
caution. 
Single dose pharmacokinetics 
Single dose pharmacokinetics of m13c7 and r13c7 and romosozumab was evaluated in rats. Single does 
romosozumab PK was evaluated in monkeys. 
Rat 
A non-linear increase of exposure of m13C7 was observed over the dose range 0.1 to 10 mg/kg (IV). With 
the 100 increase in dose, AUCinf increased from 23 to 18000 µg*h/mL, a 779-fold increase. Half-life values 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 33/263 
  
  
increased with dose (6 h at 0.1 mg/kg and 28 h at 10 mg/kg), and clearance decreased (4.4 mL/h/kg at 0.1 
mg/kg and 0.56 mL/h/kg at 10 mg/kg). With subcutaneous administration, similar AUCinf values were 
observed at the same dose IV (481(sc) vs 472 (IV) µg*h/mL at 1 mg/kg), the median Tmax was 24 h. 
A greater than dose-proportional increase was also seen in the range 5 to 35 mg/kg in rats administered 
AMG785 SC. Similar values were measured using the different formulations with different concentrations (10 
and 70 mg/mL). For the 5 mg/kg, SC, group, the mean CL/F value was 2.42 mL/h/kg. The exposure based 
on AUC was 2-fold greater after 35 mg/kg IV (45100 µg*h/mL) compared with the same dose SC (22700-
25800 µg*h/mL). After SC administration, Tmax was observed at 48 h.  
The other rodent analogue of the antibody, r13C7, was investigated in ovariectomised aged female rats. The 
animals were administered 100 mg/kg SC with an observed Cmax of 403 µg/mL at the Tmax 96 h. The 
exposure expressed as AUC0-672 was 112000 µg*h/mL. 
Monkey 
Female cynomolgus monkeys were administered romosozumab SC (3, 30, 30 mg/kg) twice with one month 
between the doses. After the first dose, a non-linear increase of the exposure was observed. A 10-fold 
increase in dose resulted in a 12-fold increase in Cmax (18 µg/mL at 3 mg/kg, 210 µg/mL at 30 mg/kg) and 
21-fold increase in AUCinf (2570 µg*h/mL at 3 mg/kg and 54300 µg*h/mL at 30 mg/kg). Half-lives increased 
with dose (41 h at 3 mg/kg and 71 h at 30 mg/kg), CL/F values decreased with dose (1.2 mL/h/kg at 3 
mg/kg and 0.6 at 30 mg/kg). The median Tmax was 45 hours. 
Summary 
The PK was non-linear over the dose ranges investigated, with a greater than dose proportional increase in 
exposure in both rats and monkeys and with m13C7 and romosozumab. Absorption following SC 
administration was approximately 100% at 1 mg/kg but decreased to about 50% when the rats were 
administered 35 mg/kg. The Tmax after SC administration ranged between 24 and 96 hours across the studies 
and species. The half-life ranged between 6-28 h in rats (m13C7) and 40-71 h in monkeys (romosozumab) 
with longer times with increased dose. 
Distribution 
No dedicated studies on tissue distribution were performed and this is considered acceptable. The estimated 
volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) in rats, 37-59 mL/kg, was in the same range as reported 
estimates of plasma volumes in rats.  
The fetal-to-maternal serum concentration ratio in rat following administration of romosozumab 10 mg/kg 
was 89% and following 300 mg/kg 41%. The results indicate that romosozumab crosses the placenta. 
Metabolism 
No dedicated metabolism studies were performed, and this is considered acceptable and in agreement with 
ICH S6(R1). The metabolic pathways of biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals are generally understood and 
include degradation to small peptides and individual amino acids. 
Excretion 
No excretion of intact romosozumab in urine is expected due to its molecular size. Therefore, no specific 
studies to measure romosozumab excretion in urine were conducted. The absence of studies is considered 
acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 34/263 
  
  
 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Drug-drug interaction at the PK level is highly unlikely for this type of product since biotechnology derived 
substances do not metabolize via CYP450 enzymes. Therefore, the absence of PK interaction studies is 
agreed. 
Other pharmacokinetic studies 
A study was conducted to determine and compare the pharmacokinetics of romosozumab when administered 
as two different formulations via a single SC injection to cynomolgus monkeys. The exposure of the two 
different manufacturing processes as assessed by Cmax and AUC was comparable.  
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
The toxicological profile of romosozumab has been evaluated in an extensive set of non-clinical studies. The 
program includes repeat-dose studies up to 26 weeks with 14 weeks recovery in rats and monkeys; 
reproductive toxicity studies in rats, a carcinogenicity study in rats, a carcinogenicity study in rats with an 
“irrelevant” human IgG2 mAb, local tolerance studies, tissue-cross reactivity study and several mechanistic 
studies.  
The subcutaneous (SC) route of administration was utilized in all toxicology studies to match the intended 
clinical administration route, with intravenous dosing included in some repeat-dose studies to obtain higher 
systemic exposures.   
The Sprague Dawley rat and cynomolgus monkey were selected as the main rodent and non-rodent 
toxicology species as romosozumab binds to human, rat, and cynomolgus monkey sclerostin with similar 
affinity and is pharmacologically active in these species. 
Immunogenicity was evaluated as part of the general toxicology program.  Romosozumab was immunogenic 
in the rat, rabbit and monkey. To ensure robust assessment of the toxicity of romosozumab in longer term 
studies, rats and monkeys positive for ADAs with high signal/noise and reduced serum romosozumab 
concentration and/or presence of neutralizing antibodies were removed from study and data analyses. 
Therefore, in studies of longer duration than 1 month, the initial numbers of animals allocated on study were 
greater than that being evaluated. 
Single-dose toxicity  
A formal single-dose toxicity study was not conducted.  No acute toxicity was observed following a single 
intravenous dose (300 mg/kg) in cynomolgus monkeys or rats in safety pharmacology studies or after the 
first dose in repeat-dose toxicology studies in the rat and cynomolgus monkey at dose levels up to 300 
mg/kg IV and SC. 
Repeat-dose toxicity 
Romosozumab has been evaluated in repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats (up to 26 weeks with 14 weeks 
recovery) and in monkeys (up to 26 weeks with 14 weeks recovery). 
A 4-week repeat-dose study was also conducted in the rabbit to evaluate the suitability of the rabbit as a 
second species for developmental toxicity studies.  Romosozumab was highly immunogenic in the rabbit 
resulting in immune complex disease in some animals and thus was considered unsuitable for assessment of 
potential developmental toxicity of romosozumab. 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 35/263 
  
  
In view of the MoA of romosozumab, pivotal toxicology studies included assessment of one or more of the 
following endpoints: bone formation and resorption biomarkers; cancellous and cortical bone densitometry, 
cancellous and/or cortical bone biomechanical strength, and bone histomorphometric indices. As these data 
are not considered to add critical value from a toxicological perspective, only high-level results of these 
investigations are presented. 
Romosozumab treatment was generally well tolerated with minimal inflammatory infiltrates at injection sites 
in repeat-dose studies in rat and monkey. Romosozumab-related effects observed in the rat and monkey 
administered doses up to 300 mg/kg/week for 14 days or 1 month and up to 100 mg/kg/week for 6 months 
were either a direct or indirect consequence of the pharmacological effects on bone.   
Primary effects on bone 
At all dose levels up to 100 mg/kg/week (the maximum dose level in both species) in the 26-week studies, 
the combined histomorphometric, densitometric, biomechanical, and/or bone biomarker data in the rat and 
monkey collectively support that romosozumab increased bone formation on cancellous, endocortical, and 
periosteal surfaces with maximal effects on bone formation biomarkers at 4 weeks that progressively declined 
with continued treatment.  In rat, thickening of calvarium and long bones, and firm bone marrow was evident 
macroscopically.  Dose-dependent increases in cortical and cancellous bone mass were observed in the rat 
and monkey.  Some partial reversal of the bone mass effect was apparent at the end of recovery in both 
species, notably at the lower doses.   
Biomechanical and ash testing of bones in the monkey demonstrated that normal bone quality and 
mineralization was maintained with romosozumab treatment.  There were no notable effects on bone 
resorption parameters during dosing, and minimal increases were observed during the recovery period in the 
rat.   
Secondary effects 
As a consequence of the increased bone formation, the bone marrow space was reduced leading to impaired 
erythropoiesis.  
In rats, this was reflected as decreases in erythrocyte parameters (red blood cell count, haemoglobin and 
haematocrit; up to 16%) and an increase in red cell distribution (up to 20%). These decreases in erythrocyte 
parameters were generally associated with dose-related decreases in platelet number (up to 19%). A 
regenerative red cell and platelet response was indicated by significant increases in reticulocytes (up to 
101%) and platelet volume (up to 10%). These effects on hematology parameters were seen at all dose 
levels (i.e. ≥ 10 mg/kg/week) and showed evidence of reversibility during recovery. As a compensatory 
mechanism, increased spleen weights and increased extramedullary hematopoiesis in spleen and liver was 
observed.  
In monkeys administered romosozumab for 26 weeks, hematologic changes included slight decreases in 
mean red cell number (up to 12%) observed at all dose levels. The clinical trial data indicate that 
romosozumab at 210 mg QM for 1 year does not have effects on hematopoiesis as there were no major 
changes in hematology parameters. 
Additional alterations in clinical pathology parameters observed in the 26-week monkey study include 
reversible transient reductions in serum calcium and phosphorus (up to 16% in males at 100 mg/kg/week) at 
Weeks 4 and 12. As the decreases corresponded temporally to maximal increases in bone formation markers, 
the reductions are considered consequences of the high demand for calcium and phosphorus to support 
normal bone mineralization. Transient hypocalcaemia has been observed in patients receiving romosozumab 
(SmPC section 4.8), and contraindication in uncorrected hypocalcemia is included in section 4.3, and 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 36/263 
  
  
recommendations regarding monitoring and vitamin supplementation is included in section 4.4. In addition, 
hypocalcemia is proposed as an important identified risk in the RMP. 
In rats, reversible increases in serum phosphorus and urea occurred at 100 mg/kg/week in males and 
transient dose-dependent increases in glucose in females at equal to or greater than 10 mg/kg/week.  No 
effect on glucose levels was observed in monkey at exposures up to 200-fold greater than the clinical AUC 
exposure. 
Genotoxicity 
Romosozumab is a recombinant protein made up entirely of naturally occurring amino acids and contains no 
inorganic linkers, synthetic organic linkers or other non-protein portions.  Therefore, romosozumab would not 
react directly with DNA or other chromosomal material and no genotoxicity studies have been conducted. 
This is agreed. 
Carcinogenicity 
Carcinogenicity assessment is based on a discussion of sclerostin biology, results of pharmacological and 
toxicological studies with romosozumab, together with results of a 2-year study of romosozumab in rats and 
another, pharmacologically inactive but immunogenic foreign IgG2 antibody as additional control. 
In the romosozumab 2-year study, treatment was generally well-tolerated at dose levels of 3, 10 and 50 
mg/kg/week for 98 weeks. There were no romosozumab-related effects on mortality or cause of death.   
Pharmacologically-mediated increased skeletal radiopacity, increased bone mass and geometry at the femur 
metaphysis and diaphysis by pQCT, and microscopic changes of hyperostosis of bones, and secondary 
extramedullary hematopoiesis in spleen and liver, and mononuclear cell infiltrate at the injection sites were 
observed. Two tumors reached statistical significance, renal lipoma in females at 50 mg/kg/week and adrenal 
cortical adenoma in males at 10 mg/kg/week. Both tumors are considered incidental and not related to 
romosozumab administration. Although not statistically significant, two osteosarcomas were noted in males 
at the highest dose tested, 50 mg/kg/week (incidence 3.7%), but not in any of the other study groups. Bone 
neoplasms and osteosarcomas are rare in Sprague-Dawley rats with a background incidence of 0.38%, 
ranging from 0 to 3.33%, based on historical control data from the Test Facility. Thus, the incidence of 
osteosarcomas in males at 50 mg/kg/week is slightly outside of the historical control range. There were no 
metastases noted indicating a late onset and solitary nature and there were no observed proliferative 
precursor osteoblastic changes or benign bone tumors. The predicted AUC0-168h exposure in the three 
treatment groups have been calculated using the Week 25 steady state AUC0-168h values from the 6-month 
repeat dose rat study based on exposures in ADA-negative animals and are 1840, 12900 and 62000 µg∙h/mL 
at 3, 10 and 50 mg/kg/week, respectively. The corresponding AUC exposure margins are around 0.6, 4 and 
19 versus the clinical therapeutic exposure. 
An additional lifetime study in rats was conducted with an irrelevant antibody (AMG 589, a human IgG2 
monoclonal antibody to human calcitonin gene related peptide) that is pharmacologically inactive and 
immunogenic in the Sprague Dawley rat to determine possible effects related to lifetime exposure to a 
foreign antibody. The weekly subcutaneous administration of AMG 589 was well-tolerated at 50 mg/kg/week 
for up to 98 weeks. There was no neoplastic change attributed to AMG 589. Non-neoplastic changes 
consisted of increased incidence of minimal mononuclear cell infiltration at the injection site and was graded 
minimal in most affected animals.

Reproductive and developmental toxicity  
A full reproductive and developmental toxicity package has been performed in rats, including preliminary and 
definitive embryo-fetal development (EFD) studies, a combined fertility and EFD study, and a pre-and post-
natal development study. Romosozumab treatment was generally well tolerated across studies. 
Male and female fertility 
In the combined fertility and EFD study, there were no romosozumab-related effects on mating, fertility, or 
male reproductive assessments (sperm parameters or organ weights), and there were no effects on estrous 
cycling or any ovarian or uterine parameters. The NOAEL for male and female fertility is therefore 300 
mg/kg/week. Mean maternal romosozumab exposure (AUC0-168h) at 300 mg/kg on GD 13 was 179.8 mg∙h/mL 
and represents around 59-fold margin over clinical AUC exposure.  
Embryo-fetal development 
The effect of romosozumab on embryo-fetal development was evaluated in one DRF study and in 2 pivotal 
EFD studies. In the combined fertility and EFD study, no romosozumab-related external or visceral 
malformations or variations and no skeletal malformations were observed. At 300 mg/kg/week, 3 fetuses 
(2.0%) from 3 litters (13.6%) had reduced ventral processes on the 6th cervical vertebra (synonymous with 
“the arch(es) in the 6th cervical vertebrae having the appearance of the arch(es) in the 7th cervical 
vertebra”), which was attributed to romosozumab. At 300 mg/kg/week, maternal romosozumab exposure 
(AUC0-168h) on GD 13 was 179.8 mg∙h/mL and represents ~59-fold margin over clinical AUC exposure. The 
mean fetal romosozumab serum concentrations on GD 20 was 114 µg/mL. 
In the DRF EFD study, there were no romosozumab-related effects on maternal, embryo, or fetal parameters, 
including external, visceral or skeletal fetal malformations or variations.  Exposures (AUC0-144 GD 13) 
achieved in dams at 300 mg/kg/week was 103 mg∙hr/mL representing around 30-fold margin over clinical 
AUC exposure, which is a conservative estimate of the margin because it is based on AUC0-144 rather than 
AUC0-168. The mean fetal romosozumab serum concentrations at 300 mg/kg/week on GD 19 was 65.8 µg/mL. 
In the pivotal embryo-fetal development study, there were no romosozumab-related effects on maternal or 
litter parameters or fetal soft tissue malformations or variations. Like in the combined fertility and EFD study, 
the skeletal variation of reduced ventral processes of 6th cervical vertebrae was observed at ≥100 
mg/kg/week. At 100 mg/kg/week, this variation was observed in 4 fetuses (2.2%) of 4 litters (16.7%), and 
at 300 mg/kg/week, it was observed in 5 fetuses (3.0%) of 4 litters (18.2%). As the incidences were dose-
related and exceeded testing facility historical control range, the alteration is considered related to 
romosozumab administration.  
External fetal malformations were observed in 1 of 22 litters at 300 mg/kg/week.  Seven of 16 fetuses from 
this litter had external malformations of extra digits on the fore- and/or hindpaws; 6 of 7 fetuses also had 
external malformations of fused digits.  In addition to these external malformations, 3 of 7 fetuses had 
associated skeletal malformations including extra digits, extra distal phalanges, fused phalanges, absence of 
ossified metacarpals, and/or bent tibia in fore - and/or hind-limbs, as well as skeletal variations that included 
incompletely ossified phalanges, misaligned metacarpals, large ulnae, misaligned metatarsals and large 
tibias, irregularly shaped metacarpals, broad ribs, irregularly shaped ilia. At GD 21, the dam of this litter 
(#10979) was ADA-positive with serum romosozumab concentration lower than the group mean at 300 
mg/kg (83.9 µg/mL versus a mean of 121 µg/mL). Although the gross external and skeletal malformations 
occurred in only one litter, the litter and fetal incidences exceeded the historical range of the testing facility 
at the time of the conduct of this study. 
Pre- and post-natal development 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 38/263 
  
  
There were no romosozumab-related effects on maternal parameters. For the F1 generation during the pre-
weaning period, there were no romosozumab-related effects on clinical signs, macroscopic observations 
including external malformations of the digits, pup viability, or pup body weights.  On lactation day 21, there 
were no effects on femur length and no romosozumab-related microscopic changes in the femur.  No skeletal 
abnormalities in the C6 cervical vertebrae in F1 generation pups were observed indicating that the reduced 
ventral process finding in fetuses represent a developmental delay. pQCT revealed slight changes in femoral 
bone mass or cortical geometry. At lactation day 21, total and cortical/subcortical femoral metaphyseal vBMC 
and vBMD (males and females) and trabecular vBMC and vBMD (females) were minimally decreased at ≥ 60 
mg/kg/week.   
For the F1 generation pups that continued on study after lactation day 21, there were no romosozumab-
related effects on survival, growth, sexual maturation, behavioral endpoints (learning and memory or 
activity), mating and fertility, male reproductive organ weights or ovarian and uterine parameters, or 
macroscopic observations. In conclusion, romosozumab had no adverse effects on pre-and post-natal 
development endpoints in the rat. 
Local tolerance 
Studies were performed to evaluate the local tolerance of romosozumab at different concentrations and the 
two formulations used in the nonclinical and clinical program, Process 1 (sodium acetate formulation) and 
Process 2 (calcium acetate formulation). The results show that the local response to romosozumab is 
concentration-dependent and that both formulations elicit similar responses at a fixed concentration. The 
sodium or calcium acetate formulations of romosozumab were used in repeat-dose toxicity studies in which 
romosozumab was well-tolerated locally and was associated with minimal inflammatory infiltrates.  
Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity was evaluated as part of the general toxicology program.  Romosozumab was immunogenic 
in the rat, rabbit and monkey. ADAs had minimal impact on studies up to 1-month duration as 3 to 4 weeks 
of dosing is generally required for an immune response. To ensure robust assessment of the toxicity of 
romosozumab in longer term studies, rats and monkeys positive for binding ADAs with high S/N and reduced 
serum romosozumab concentration and/or presence of neutralizing antibodies were removed from study and 
data analyses. There were no adverse consequences of ADAs in rats and monkeys.  In the rabbit, adverse 
consequences of the immune response to romosozumab (immune complex disease) occurred in a few 
animals. It should be noted that immunogenicity to a human protein in non-clinical species is of no predictive 
value for the clinical situation. 
Immunotoxicity 
Immunotoxicity endpoints, specifically immunophenotypic analyses of circulating B-cells, were evaluated as 
part of a 52-week bone quality study in cynomolgus monkeys. This analysis was conducted because reduction 
in bone marrow B cells has been reported in sclerostin-knockout mice (Sost-/- mice; Cain et al, 2012).  No 
romosozumab-related effects were observed on circulating B-cell numbers.   
Tissue cross-reactivity  
A TCR study was performed with romosozumab using normal tissues from humans, cynomolgus monkeys, 
rabbits, and rats.  In vitro binding of romosozumab was observed in osteocytes in cryosections of human, 
cynomolgus monkey, and rabbit bone samples. Specific binding was not observed in rat bone. Romosozumab 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020

binding was observed in stromal fibres of the aorta or pulmonary artery in a heart section from one monkey 
where these tissues elements were present.  
Mechanistic studies 
Transcriptional changes following Scl-ab (r13C7) administration in OVX rats 
Two mechanistic studies were conducted in aged OVX rats to gain insight into the acute and chronic 
transcriptional changes that occur in the osteoblast lineage (i.e. osteoblasts, lining cells, and osteocytes) in 
response to Scl-Ab (r13C7, a rat version of romosozumab). 
During the first week following a single dose of Scl-Ab, an upregulation of a small number of canonical Wnt 
target genes with known roles in osteoblastogenesis accompanied by upregulation of numerous bone matrix 
genes were observed. In general, a similar pattern was observed in all 3 cell populations. Among canonical 
Wnt target genes, Wisp1 and Twist1 were the most responsive followed by Bglap, Gja1 and Mmp2. The 
responsive extracellular matrix genes include those encoding specific structural components of osteoid 
matrix, including collagens and non-collagenous matrix proteins (eg, Omd, Bgn, Dcn, Sparc), and genes 
involved in matrix synthesis (eg, Lepre, Lox, BMP1) and matrix mineralization (eg, Alpl).  
Pathway analyses also indicated that Scl-Ab regulated a limited number of genes related to cell cycle arrest 
and B cell development. Decreased cell cycle activity was flagged largely due to significantly increased 
expression of two p53 target genes and cell cycle inhibitors, Cdkn1a (p21) and Cgref1, coupled with a 
decreased expression of Cdc25b in all cell types. Cxcl12 and Cd24 were identified in the B cell development 
biological pathways and were significantly downregulated.  
Following administration of Scl-Ab for 26 weeks, histomorphometrical analysis of vertebrae revealed a rapid 
and marked increase in vertebral bone formation rate/bone surface (BFR/BS) and osteoblast numbers (Ob.N) 
with maximal bone formation rate/bone surface on Day 29, followed by a progressive decline with continued 
dosing through Day 183.  During the recovery, bone formation rate/bone surface was initially suppressed and 
then returned to vehicle levels.  Trabecular bone mass progressively increased through Day 183 and declined 
during recovery. Osteoclastic surface/bone surface (Oc.S/BS) was decreased during dosing and increased in 
the recovery period with corresponding changes in expression of major regulators of osteoclastogenesis.  
Reduction in osteoprogenitors preceded the reduction in osteoblasts and bone formation and correlated with 
significant transcriptional changes in the osteocyte. Transcriptional changes included induction of signalling 
pathways known to regulate Wnt signalling and suppress mitogenesis and cell cycle progression. The 
temporal correspondence of these changes suggests that this coordinated response of downstream regulatory 
pathways modulates the transcriptional output of canonical Wnt signalling and contributes to self-regulation 
of bone formation with long-term Scl-Ab treatment. The most significant signalling changes in cancellous 
osteocytes occurred in pathways that would limit cell cycle progression. The temporal relationship between 
these transcriptional changes and changes in bone formation rate/bone surface suggests that suppression of 
mitogenesis and cell cycle progression may contribute to the self-regulation of bone formation observed with 
long-term Scl-Ab treatment. Evidence of p53 signalling was present in femur cortical osteocytes at times of 
maximal bone formation and was not associated with a reduction in bone formation. These differences 
between cancellous and cortical suggest that p53 signalling functions to reduce bone formation in cancellous 
bone and operates to coordinate proliferation and growth in cortical bone.  
Comparison of effects of romosozumab and hPTH in bone 
Another study was conducted in adolescent rats to compare the effects of romosozumab and hPTH (1-34) at 
the level of the osteoblast lineage in vertebrae using stereological methods.  Romosozumab generally 
affected greater increases in cancellous and cortical bone mass than PTH, correlating with bone formation 
Assessment report

rate at 4 weeks in the spine and mid-femur without corresponding increases in bone resorption indices.  The 
increases in vertebral bone formation rate at 4 weeks attenuated with continued treatment to a greater 
extent with romosozumab than with PTH.  At 4 weeks, both romosozumab and PTH affected equivalent 
increases in total osteoblast numbers.  Osteoblast density remained similar across groups while mineral 
apposition rate was significantly higher with romosozumab at week 4, reflecting an increase in individual 
osteoblast vigour relative to vehicle and PTH.  After 26 weeks romosozumab maintained bone formation rate 
with fewer osteoblasts and lower osteoblast density by increasing the osteoblast footprint (bone surface area 
occupied by an Ob) and increasing mineral apposition rate, compared with PTH. This reduction in osteoblast 
density at the formative site was associated with a coordinated reduction in osteoprogenitors that was more 
pronounced than the effects with PTH.  These time-dependent reductions in subpopulations of the osteoblast 
lineage may be integral to the greater attenuation or self-regulation of bone formation observed at the 
vertebra with romosozumab.  The observation that hPTH requires more osteoblasts at the formative site with 
correlative increased numbers of progenitors compared with romosozumab indicates potentially greater 
stimulus for progenitor pool proliferation with PTH, an effect that could increase carcinogenic risk in bone in 
the rat. 
Effect of Scl-Ab on osteoprogenitor proliferation in OVX rats 
Following a single Scl-Ab (r13C7) administration at 50 mg/kg, the total number of BrdU-labeled osteoblasts 
was significantly increased at Day 9 by approximately 270%. Following 4 weekly Scl-Ab administrations at 50 
mg/kg, the total number of BrdU-labeled osteoblasts was increased by about 70% compared with concurrent 
vehicle controls.  Although the total number of BrdU-labeled osteoblasts remained increased at Day 29 with 
Scl-Ab treatment, it was significantly reduced compared with the number of BrdU-labeled osteoblasts at Day 
9. The data suggest that the increased osteoprogenitor proliferation attenuates with continued treatment. 
The decrease in proliferation at day 29 (versus Day 9) occurs coincident with decreases in osteoprogenitor 
numbers, even though bone formation remains significantly increased and is temporally associated with the 
onset of transcriptional changes in the osteocyte consistent with suppression of mitogenesis and cell cycle 
progression.  These coordinated effects on osteoprogenitor proliferation and number, coupled with the timing 
of signalling changes in the osteocyte, suggest that the transcriptional changes in the osteocyte reflect the 
transcriptional profile in the osteoprogenitors, or the osteocyte directly communicates with or influences the 
proliferation status of osteoprogenitor populations. 
RMP safety specification 
The applicant did not identify any non-clinical safety findings to be considered as potential or identified risks 
in the RMP. This is agreed. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Monoclonal antibodies such as romosozumab are most likely catabolized to individual amino acids and/or 
small peptides by endogenous proteases and high molecular weight prevents intact urinary excretion and as 
such, excretion of active drug is not expected. It is not expected to have an adverse effect on the 
environment. The Applicant has adequately justified the absence of studies to assess the environmental risk 
of romosozumab.

2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
In vitro pharmacodynamics studies demonstrated that romosozumab binds to sclerostin with high affinity, 
inhibits binding of sclerostin to the extracellular domains of LRP5 and LRP6 and prevents the inhibitory effect 
of sclerostin on matrix mineralization in a cell-based assay. This is in line with results presented in the public 
literature, i.e. in osteoblastic cell cultures treated with sclerostin, Scl-Ab has been shown to restore Wnt 
signalling (Veverka et al. 2009) and matrix mineralization (Li et al. 2009). The Wnt signalling pathway plays 
a significant role in skeletal development, adult skeletal homeostasis, and bone remodelling. Inhibition of 
Wnt/beta-catenin via interaction with LRP4/5/6 in the skeleton seems to be the main mechanism of action, 
somehow confirmed by the lack of extraskeletal complications in sclerosteosis or van Buchem disease. In 
addition, Thouverey and Caverzasio 2015 showed that sclerostin can prevent osteoblast differentiation 
without antagonizing LRP5/6 and can activate platelet-derived growth factor (PDGFR) signalling resulting in 
the inhibition of osteoblast differentiation in vitro. PDGFR signalling critically regulates post infarction repair 
(Zymek et al. 2006), which would be reduced or inhibited by romosozumab treatment. The clinical experience 
with other PDGFR inhibitors, especially Imatinib (having only weak activity against other TKs) showing only 
rarely cardiotoxic effects, together with the artificial nature of the study published by Thouverey and 
Caverzasio 2015 (i.e. a minor and transitory increase in p-PDGFR, the “activation of PDGFR signalling 
required for the inhibitory action of sclerostin on osteoblast differentiation” was only shown in the 
mesenchymal cell line and not in other cell types closer to osteoblasts, artificially high levels of sclerostin [in 
excess of 1000-fold higher than circulating sclerostin levels in the human] were used and tested only at a 
single concentration [10 µg/mL]) do however not indicate any safety concerns in this regards.  
In vivo pharmacodynamic effect of romosozumab was demonstrated in rat and cynomolgus monkey models 
of postmenopausal bone loss and in male cynomolgus monkeys with fibular and ulnar osteotomy at exposure 
levels similar to the clinical exposure and up 36-fold and 19-fold multiples of the clinical exposure in rats and 
monkeys, respectively. Romosozumab (or rodent-specific surrogates) displayed dose-dependent increase in 
bone formation and restoration of bone mass and bone strength as well as improved healing of bones. As 
romosozumab binds to human, cynomolgus monkey, and rat sclerostin with a similar strong affinity and was 
shown to be pharmacologically active in rats and cynomolgus monkeys in vivo, the rationale for inhibition of 
sclerostin in the treatment of osteoporosis and the use of rats and cynomolgus monkeys to assess primary- 
and safety pharmacology studies to support the clinical program is justified.  
The initial bone formation response to antibody neutralization of sclerostin occurs via stimulation of 
osteoblasts and activation of quiescent bone lining cells to produce matrix as evaluated in animal models of 
osteoporosis (Ominsky et al. 2015). However, sustained treatment with Scl-Ab in OVX rats is associated with 
a blunting in the levels of serum bone formation markers P1NP and osteocalcin (Stolina et al. 2014). This 
early reduction of the bone formation response likely reflects changes in the pathways that effect self-
regulation following treatment with Scl-Ab. In the studies of romosozumab in rat and cynomolgus monkeys 
provided, increases in bone mass over time were related to an early increase in bone formation. 
Furthermore, treatment of rats with the surrogate antibody r13C7 resulted in significantly increased 
expression of genes coding for Wnt inhibitors (sost, dkk1, mepe, and dmp1), also indicating that 
romosozumab induced bone formation is self-regulated. The effects observed in nonclinical studies were 
consistent with the overall temporal pattern of serum biomarker responses and increases in BMD observed in 
humans.

Overall, the in vivo safety pharmacology studies performed in normal intact rats and monkeys indicate no 
adverse cardiovascular effects (ECG, QT/QTc, heart rate and blood pressure) or any other findings concerning 
the safety parameters after subcutaneous dosing of romosozumab up to 300 mg/kg, with estimated exposure 
margins of > 210 -fold to the clinical exposure (Cmax: 28.1 µg/mL at the 210 mg dose). 
Based on the expression pattern of sclerostin and its known role as an inhibitor of canonical Wnt signalling, 
the applicant has provided a comprehensive theoretical discussion on the possible secondary pharmacological 
effects of sclerostin antibodies and its subsequent activation of Wnt signalling, with possible safety concerns 
that could be identified. Potential concerns regarding the secondary pharmacology of romosozumab on 
vascular calcification and cardiovascular safety have been suggested. The applicant was during the procedure 
asked to further discuss this issue. In response to this question, the applicant has presented a thorough 
review, including new non-clinical in vivo and in vitro mechanistic data, to clarify the suggested protective 
role of sclerostin in vascular calcification and provided a detailed discussion on the effect of sclerostin 
inhibition on promoting atherosclerosis and its possible consequences for cardiovascular safety. A weight of 
evidence assessment of all available non-clinical data indicates no obvious mechanistic association between 
sclerostin inhibition and vascular calcification or promotion of atherosclerosis, in normal and/or diseased 
tissue.  Further non-clinical testing is, thus, not likely to contribute to the overall benefit / risk assessment in 
humans. Therefore, this issue will not be pursued from a non-clinical point of view.  
Toxicology 
The toxicological profile of romosozumab has been evaluated in an extensive set of non-clinical studies in 
relevant species and in agreement with applicable guidelines. 
Romosozumab treatment was generally well tolerated with minimal inflammatory infiltrates at injection sites 
in repeat-dose studies in rat and monkey. Romosozumab-related effects observed in the rat and monkey 
administered doses up to 300 mg/kg/week for 14 days or 1 month and up to 100 mg/kg/week for 6 months 
were either a direct or indirect consequence of the pharmacological effects on bone.   
The available data in the rat and monkey collectively support that romosozumab increased bone formation. 
As a consequence of the increased bone formation, the bone marrow space was reduced leading to impaired 
erythropoiesis. The increased bone formation did not cause any adverse clinical consequences, such 
neurological or locomotor effects in rats or monkeys. Furthermore, no mineralization in tissues outside bone 
was observed.  
In the 1-month rat study, the severity of the hyperostosis was increased in females as compared to males. 
Likewise, in the 6-month rat study, vertebral cancellous bone formation rates were increased at 10 
mg/kg/dose in females but not males, suggesting that the anabolic response on cancellous bone surfaces had 
attenuated in males. In male rats given 100 mg/kg/dose, dynamic indices of bone formation (reflecting the 
surface extent of cancellous bone formation) were, in general, decreased compared with controls. The 
Applicant speculates that the greater hyperostosis observed in the females could be related to the smaller 
bone area and higher trabecular bone density in this gender at baseline, meaning that any increase in the 
thickness of the trabecular bone would be more evident in females than males by histopathology. Most 
importantly, the apparent sex differences in bone mineral density observed in these two rat studies did not 
appear to impact the intended pharmacology of romosozumab. 
A clarification has been provided on the human AUC0-tao of 12888 µg∙h/mL used for the exposure margin 
calculations. This value represents the clinical exposure as estimated from population PK analysis completed 
prior to availability of Phase 3 clinical data. In the final population PK analysis including the Phase 3 clinical 
data, the human AUC0-tau presented in Report 119384A is 509 µg∙day/mL which is equivalent to 12216 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 43/263 
  
  
µg∙h/mL (509 µg∙day/mL x 24 h). As this value is within approximately 5% of the human AUC0-tau value used 
to calculate the exposure margins, it is agreed that there is no impact on the conclusions previously made. 
In the romosozumab rat carcinogenicity study, two osteosarcomas (OSAs) were observed in the male 50 
mg/kg/week group (high dose), but not in the other romosozumab-treated groups or in the vehicle control 
groups. OSAs are rare in Sprague-Dawley rats with a background incidence of 0.38%, ranging from 0 to 
3.33%, based on historical control data from the Test Facility. Thus, the incidence of osteosarcomas in males 
at 50 mg/kg/week of 3.7% (2/54 males) is slightly higher than the historical control range. However, the 
incidence was not statistically significantly different from the vehicle control incidence. A further discussion on 
the osteosarcomas has been provided by the Applicant.  
In male 4041, one OSA was detected radiographically in the left proximal tibia at Day 572 following early 
euthanasia (cause of death, pituitary adenoma). This OSA was not observed macroscopically and would likely 
not have been detected in a standard carcinogenicity study. In male 4069, one OSA was detected 
radiographically and macroscopically on the frontal bone/skull at Day 587 and was the cause of death due to 
local extension. There were no metastases in either case and no other bone tumours were identified in the 
study. With exception of focal osteoblast hyperplasia observed in a single male at 10 mg/kg on Day 534, no 
pre-neoplastic lesions were observed in the carcinogenicity study, or in a 6-month rat study with dose levels 
up to 100 mg/kg/week. Focal osteoblast hyperplasia was also observed in one control animal in the rat 
carcinogenicity study with an irrelevant mAb. 
The day of observation of the spontaneous OSAs in the historical control dataset ranged from Day 447 to Day 
710, i.e. an onset occurring late in the conduct of the study. The OSAs in the romosozumab-treated males 
were also observed at a late stage of the study, i.e. on Days 572 and 587, respectively. 
It should be noted that the carcinogenicity study included whole-body autoradiography, whereas the 
historical incidence of OSAs in SD rats at the laboratory at the time this study was conducted was derived 
from carcinogenicity studies where detection of OSA was restricted to the routine microscopic evaluation of 
sternum and/or single long bone sections in addition to any skeletal macroscopic abnormalities. Historical 
data from studies where whole-body radiography was conducted are not available. It is therefore reasonable 
to assume that the inclusion of whole body radiographs and the expanded bone evaluations would enhance 
the sensitivity for detection of potentially malignant bone lesions.  
The Applicant also briefly presented carcinogenicity data from other bone-forming agents including 
parathyroid hormone, hPTH (1-84), and its analogue, teriparatide hPTH (1-34) in male SD and/or F344 rats 
showing a high incidence of OSA (16.4 to 51.7%). These OSAs were often metastatic and were associated 
with proliferative osteoblastic changes such as osteoblast hyperplasia, focal stromal proliferation and benign 
bone tumour formation. The earliest time of OSA observation was reported to be around 12/13 months. 
Taken together, based on the low incidence, the lack of pre-neoplastic lesions, the late onset, and the lack of 
accompanied metastasis and other bone tumors, the conclusion is that the OSAs are likely incidental in 
nature. Consequently, these data do not indicate a potential risk to humans regarding bone malignancies.  
A complete reproductive and developmental toxicity package in rats has been performed although 
romosozumab was intended for treatment of osteoporosis in post-menopausal women and in adult men only.  
In the evaluation of male and female fertility, there were no romosozumab-related effects on fertility 
parameters. In addition, there were no gross or microscopic changes in reproductive organs observed in 
repeat-dose studies in rats and monkeys for up to 26-weeks of duration.

The effect of romosozumab on embryo-fetal development was evaluated in one DRF study and in 2 pivotal 
EFD studies. Across EFD studies, a slight increase in the incidence of reduced ventral processes on the 6th 
cervical vertebrae was observed at 300 mg/kg/week in the combined fertility and EFD studyThe ventral 
processes develop into the carotid tubercles on the 6th cervical vertebra, an anatomic structure which does 
not occur in human (Walker 2002).  This skeletal variation is considered a developmental delay because 
development of the ventral processes of the cervical vertebrae proceeds in an anterior-to-posterior direction 
and the ventral processes on the 7th cervical vertebrae have not started to develop at the time of fetal 
examination (GD 21). The absence of skeletal abnormalities in the C6 cervical vertebrae in F1 generation 
pups in the pre- and post-natal development study further supports a developmental delay.  
Across the four rat reproductive and developmental studies, external/skeletal digit malformations were 
observed in 1 of 75 litters (7 of 1021 fetuses or 0.7% incidence) at a dose of 300 mg/kg/week. While it is 
agreed that the incidence is low, both syndactyly and polydactyly are rare malformations in Sprague Dawley 
rats. As sclerostin has been suggested a role in digit formation, the Applicant was asked to further discuss 
the relevance of the digit malformations observed in rats for the human situation.  
The Applicant has provided a discussion on the human relevance of the observed external/skeletal digit 
malformations and argues that the digit malformations are likely unrelated to romosozumab due to the low 
incidence, and presence in an ADA-positive dam with systemic exposure lower than in other dams at the 
same dos level. While it is agreed that the incidence of the digit malformations is low, both syndactyly and 
polydactyly are rare malformations in Sprague Dawley rats. In literature, incidences of syndactyly of 0.01% 
(0-0.32%; 29 studies), and 0.07% (0-0.73%; 17 studies) are reported (Nakatsuka et al, 1997). The same is 
true for polydactyly, where incidences of 0.02% (0-0.30%; 29 studies) are reported (Nakatsuka et al, 1997). 
Also in Ema et al, 2014, low spontaneous incidences of syndactyly are presented; 0.04% (0-0.30%; 7 
studies), and 0.08% (0-0.30%; 4 studies). 
Sclerostin has been suggested a role in digit formation as shown in humans with loss-of-function mutations in 
the SOST gene (sclerosteosis) and sclerostin knock-out mice (Sost -/-).  Incidence of syndactyly in human 
subjects with sclerosteosis occurs at a rate of approximately 75% (Beighton et al 1984) and at 4% in Sost -/- 
mice (Collette et al 2013). As sclerostin has been suggested a role in digit formation, the observed 
malformations are considered potentially related to romosozumab treatment. 
Digit formation occurs late during organogenesis in rats (approximately GD 13 to 17) and humans 
(approximately GD 37 to 60). In rats, maternal IgG crosses the yolk sac by FcRn-mediated transport 
mechanisms and significant pre-natal exposure has been reported to occur during the period of 
organogenesis (DeSesso et al 2012). Although, fetal exposure was not determined at the time of 
organogenesis in the performed EFD studies, significant fetal romosozumab exposure was reported at GD20 
and would be expected to be present at the key period for digit formation. From this perspective, a local 
direct effect of romosozumab in the rat embryo is considered plausible. On the other hand, in humans, FcRn-
mediated placental IgG transfer is low in the period of organogenesis and begins to increase in early second 
trimester, reaching highest levels late in the third trimester (Pentsuk and Van der Laan, 2009). Thus, the 
human is unlikely to be at risk from a direct effect of an IgG antibody such as romosozumab on 
organogenesis. In conclusion, the external/skeletal digit malformations observed in 1 of 75 litters (7 of 1021 
fetuses) at a dose of 300 mg/kg/week are considered potentially related to romosozumab treatment as these 
malformations are rare in SD rats and as sclerostin has been suggested a role in digit formation. However, 
due to differences in timing of placental IgG transfer between rats and humans, a potential risk to the 
developing human fetus following maternal exposure to romosozumab is considered low.

Romosozumab analysis 
A validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was used to quantify serum romosozumab concentrations.  
The results of the submitted pre-study validation of the analytical method are satisfactory. Polyclonal rabbit 
anti- romosozumab antibodies influence the analysis. The extent of this influence by human antibodies is 
unknown. This means that an effect of antibodies on romosozumab exposure is difficult to separate from 
interference. It may also be easier to detect antibodies in patients with low exposure.

Anti-romosozumab antibody assays  
During the clinical studies, the assessment of antibodies against romosozumab followed a standard multi-tier 
hierarchical approach to identify binding antibodies (ADAs) with screening and confirmation by drug 
inhibition, using a validated electrochemiluminescent bridging immunoassay (sensitivity 5ng/mL, lower limit 
of reliable detection (LLRD) 20ng/mL and a drug tolerance level (DTL) of 12.5µg/mL at LLRD). If confirmed 
positive, serum samples were tested for neutralizing anti-romosozumab antibodies (NAbs) using a validated 
competitive binding assay (sensitivity 0.125µg/mL, LLRD 0.75µg/mL and a drug tolerance of 62.5ng/mL at 
LLRD).  
The screening assay was set up to allow for 5% false positive results, which is appropriate for ADA screening 
in favour not to miss true positives.  Although some of the measured Cmax levels are well above (30-60 
µg/ml) the DTL of 12.5 µg/ml at the LLRD (20 ng/ml), at higher ADA concentrations (~500 ng/ml) the assay 
is still sensitive enough to detect ADAs in the presence of up to 100 µg/ml of romosozumab in the sample. 
This is regarded acceptable for studies in which patients were treated with the fixed dose of 210 mg, reaching 
mean Cmax levels below the DTL. 
Overall, the validation of the immunogenicity assays was appropriately conducted. Some issues required 
clarification. 
The applicant has satisfactorily clarified that the method performance characteristics for both assays were 
established from serum samples from both a healthy population and a romosozumab patient specific 
population. Further, the applicant has described their efforts to develop a more drug tolerant neutralizing 
antibody method by introducing an acid-treatment and neutralization procedure to remove drug from 
antidrug antibody (ADA). However, no improvement could be observed and a 4-month treatment-free period 
was introduced to allow for drug washout to ensure a reliable assessment of NAb’s. This strategy is agreed 
upon. 
Anti-denosumab (AMG 162) antibody assays  
For  some  clinical  studies,  denosumab  was  used  as  an  antiresorptive  treatment  following  administration  of 
romosozumab. Samples collected from those subjects were also tested for anti-denosumab antibodies. 
The overall approach for detection of binding antibodies against denosumab is regarded acceptable and in 
accordance with current guidelines and recommendations for immunogenicity assessment. A cell-based 
bioassay was performed to determine the neutralizing capacity of ADAs based on the principle of TRAP mRNA 
expression by RAW 264.7 cells after addition of recombinant RANKL. This bioassay strategy for determination 
of anti-AMG 162 neutralizing antibodies followed recent guidance and was thoroughly validated according to 
current recommendations. 
Mode of PK analysis 
Individual serum romosozumab concentration-time data collected with intensive sampling were analyzed by 
noncompartmental PK analysis methods.  Additionally, population PK (PPK) and PK/PD analyses in healthy 
subjects and postmenopausal women with low BMD or osteoporosis were performed using non-linear mixed 
effects modelling.  
Absorption 
The bioavailability of romosozumab was estimated to be 50 to 70% after SC administration of 1 and 5 mg/kg. 
Generally, Cmax was observed within the first week after administration.

Bioequivalence has been demonstrated between phase III (Process 2 ATO) and commercial substance 
(Process 2 ARI) in a pre-filled syringe (PFS). Bioequivalence has also been shown between process 2 ARI 
substance administered as PFS and autoinjector (AI/Pen) as well as the 70 and 90 mg/ml solutions of process 
2 ATO substance. The other formulations used during the development give rise to reasonably similar 
exposure. 
Elimination, Dose and time-dependencies 
The mode of elimination is likely target binding mediated plus FC-receptor mediated IgG degradation. 
Romosozumab exhibited nonlinear PK across the SC and IV dose ranges of 0.1 to 10 mg/kg and 1 to 5 
mg/kg, respectively (eg, 550-fold increase in mean AUCinf for the 100-fold increase in SC dose from 0.1 to 
10 mg/kg). The extent of nonlinearity was most pronounced between 1 and 3 mg/kg s.c.  
The serum romosozumab concentrations declined with a mean half-life of approximately 11 to 18 days during 
the beta (plateau) phase and 6 to 7 days during the gamma (terminal) phase. The different half-lives reflect 
the nonlinearity. The mean effective t1/2 was 12.8 days. This estimate is likely a reasonable estimation valid 
for the clinical situation where a 210 mg dose is administered once a month.  
No time-dependency in the pharmacokinetics was detected. The exposure at multiple dose conditions is 
approximately doubled the exposure after a single-dose. Possibly, the accumulation is less pronounced in 
patients, but data are conflicting. Trough concentrations are slowly increasing over at least one year. 
(Romosozumab is intended for a 1-year treatment.)  
Target population  
Comparing results of studies in healthy volunteers and patients using a non-compartmental approach, there 
are no clear indications that the pharmacokinetics differ between populations. Possibly the accumulation is 
different, but data are conflicting. No difference in PK between healthy volunteers and patients was detected 
in the population PK analysis. 
Effects of ADAs on romosozumab exposure 
A total of 8.8% of subjects in the phase 1 studies and 18.6% of subjects in the phase 2 and 3 studies in 
women with PMO developed binding ADAs after at least 1 dose of romosozumab.  
Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 2.4% (20 of 832) and 0.9%, respectively.  
Presence of binding ADAs appeared to decrease romosozumab exposure (trough concentrations) up to 22% 
at months 3, 6, and 9. The exposures became comparable (less than 10% difference in mean values) at 
month 12 between ADA positive and ADA negative subjects.  
Based on a small data set (low number of patients with neutralising antibodies) at month 3, 6, 9, and 12, the 
exposure was 33, 46, 58 and 60% lower in patients with neutralising antibodies. At present, as the effect of 
ADAs on the analysis of romosozumab is not known but interference is indicated from data with rabbit anti-
romosozumab. It cannot be concluded that the reduced concentrations are true and not just caused by 
analytical interference. Regardless, sparse data indicate that the efficacy appears unchanged (Study 
20101291). Furthermore, patients with ADA will not be identified during treatment.

Special populations 
Ethnicity, age and gender 
No clinically significant ethnic differences in romosozumab exposure have been observed. There are no 
studies in children. Many of the studies where pharmacokinetics has been followed have included elderly 
patients.  There is no conventional study comparing young and elderly patients. The mean (SD) age in 
FRAME (20070337), ARCH (20110142) and BRIDGE (20110174) was 70.9(7.0), 74.3(7.5) and 72.1(7.3) 
years, respectively. The age range was 55 to 90 yrs. 
A significant effect of gender on CL and central volume was detected in the population PK analysis, where 
females were found to have a lower exposure than males. However, the difference in exposure between 
genders was less than 0.8-fold and not considered clinically relevant. Furthermore, the difference in exposure 
between genders is also counteracted by the effect of bodyweight on exposure, as men have a higher mean 
bodyweight than women. 
Renal impairment 
Impaired renal function has been implicated with disturbances of the Wnt pathway with an elevated level of 
serum sclerostin reported in CKD subjects. A study was conducted in healthy subjects, subjects with stage 4 
CKD (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2 or ESRD receiving hemodialysis. The mean exposure (AUC) of 
romosozumab for subjects with stage 4 CKD was 44% higher than for subjects with normal renal function. 
Mean romosozumab exposure was similar between subjects with ESRD receiving hemodialysis and healthy 
subjects. The results from the population PK analysis are in line with the results from the dedicated renal 
impairment study. The clinical relevance of the increase in exposure in patients with stage 4 RI is unknown. 
Hypocalcemia was reported in >30% of the subjects with renal impairment. This is further discussed in the 
Clinical Efficacy and Safety AR.  
At present, no other populations with significantly altered sclerostin levels as compared to the phase III 
population has been identified.  
Hepatic impairment 
There is no study investigating the effect of impaired hepatic function on the pharmacokinetics of 
romosozumab. However, no effect is expected unless the sclerostin concentrations are altered. 
Body weight 
According to the population PK analysis, body weight was found to be the most influential factor of 
romosozumab PK. Weight-based doses were used in early phase 1 studies. A fixed dose of 70 mg, 140 mg, 
and/or 210 mg QM was used in all phase 2 and phase 3 studies. The mean exposure was similar when 
applying weight based (3mg/kg) and when having flat dosing (only one dose level, 210 mg). However, the 
variability was higher when not applying bodyweight-based dosing. When applying flat dosing, the exposure 
is doubled in patients weighing 32 kg and halved in patients weighing 114 kg (see Figure 1). Based on clinical 
efficacy and safety data in patients with low and high bodyweight, the difference in exposure appears to lack 
clinical relevance.

Drug interactions 
No interaction studies have been performed. Pre-treatment with alendronate did not affect romosozumab 
exposure. No interactions due to drug induced alterations in sclerostin have been identified. 
Exposure relevant for safety evaluation 
Data is conflicting regarding the exposure at the therapeutic doses. Using the popPK model, the applicant has 
simulated that the Cmax would be 33 ug/ml and AUC 633 ug*day/ml. There is a slight accumulation of 
romosozumab after monthly multiple dosing and the popPK analysis revealed that the exposure is higher in 
subjects with lower body weight and in patients with stage 4 renal impairment. The PPK-analysis also showed 
a lower clearance (12% for “manufacturing process 2”).  
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
A concentration-response model has been developed to describe the relationship between romosozumab 
concentration, BTMs (P1NP and sCTX), and BMD gains at the lumbar spine. However, the model predictions 
indicate clear model misspecification and hence conclusions regarding the concentration-bone turnover 
markers relationship from the model should not be made. In present state, the model is not advised to be 
used in future applications.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Romosozumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds and inhibits sclerostin as primary target. The 
pharmacodynamics principles have been sufficiently described by the applicant and the choice of PD markers 
is endorsed as they are considered clinically relevant, commonly used markers. PD evaluations of the effect of 
romosozumab on bone metabolism markers and bone mineral density (BMD) were investigated in seven phase

I studies in healthy men and healthy postmenopausal women (Study 20060220, Study 20090378), in subjects 
with  stage  4  renal  impairment  or  ESRD  requiring  haemodialysis  (Study  20110227),  and  in  men  and 
postmenopausal women with low BMD or osteoporosis (Study 20060221, Study 20060223, Study 20090153, 
Study 20110253). Two phase II and five phase III studies provided supportive clinical pharmacology data.  
In the first in human study (20060220), romosozumab induced a dose-dependent increase in BMD compared 
to  placebo.  Clear  differences  from  placebo  in  P1NP,  BSAP  and  sCTX  concentrations  could  be  seen  for  doses 
≥1mg/kg  SC.  Doses  of  ≥3mg/kg  romosozumab  SC  showed  a  clear  difference  from  placebo  in  osteocalcin 
concentrations. Due to a serious adverse event (nonspecific hepatitis) in the 10mg/kg dose group, the dose 
was decreased to 5mg/kg. As effects were more pronounced in the dose groups over ≥1mg/kg and antibodies 
were only detected in the higher groups of 5 and 10mg/kg in this study, doses from 1 to 3mg/kg were selected 
for the following studies.  
Bone turnover markers (BTMs) 
Following a single dose SC dose of romosozumab at 0.1 to 10 mg/kg, increases in the bone formation marker 
P1NP (procollagen type 1 N-telopeptide) levels were observed for doses from 3 mg/kg. The bone resorption 
marker sCTX (type I collagen C-telopeptide) levels decreased following administration of doses greater than 1 
mg/kg. For both markers, the change from baseline reached maximum 1-2 weeks after exposure and return 
to baseline after 8-12 weeks. 
In phase 2 dose-finding study 20060326, five romosozumab dosing regimens (70 mg QM, 140 mg Q3M, 140 
mg QM, 210 mg Q3M, 210 mg QM), placebo, alendronate and teriparatide were evaluated regarding BTM. In 
study 20101291, three romosozumab doses (70 mg QM, 140 mg QM and 210 mg QM) were compared to 
placebo.  
The combined results on P1NP and sCTX from the two studies (QM romosozumab dosing regimens and 
placebo) are shown in Figure 2. The results were used in determining the dosing regimen for the pivotal 
studies, as discussed below.

In the two pivotal phase 3 studies in women, the romosozumab effect on BTM was evaluated in substudies. 
In 20070337, 64 subjects in the romosozumab/denosumab group and 65 subjects in the placebo/denosumab 
group were included and in 20110142, 157 subjects from the romosozumab treatment arm and 141 subjects 
from the alendronate arm were included. The results from the two studies were similar. The results from 
study 20070337 are presented in Figure 3 and Figure 4.  
Figure 3: P1NP Percent Change from Baseline by Visit Median and Inter-quartile Ranges (BTM and 
Biomarker Substudy Efficacy Analysis Set) (20070337 24-Month Primary Analysis Period) 
Figure 4: sCTX Percent Change from Baseline by Visit Median and Inter-quartile Ranges (BTM and 
Biomarker Substudy Efficacy Analysis Set) (20070337 24-Month Primary Analysis Period) 
It is noted that the range of values was large (e.g. serum C-telopeptide (sCTX) ranged from 43 to 4597 ng/L 
at baseline in the romosozumab group in 20070337). 
The bone formation marker P1NP showed a rapid increase in the romosozumab group that peaked at time 
point of first assessment (day 14 in 20070337; 1 month in 20110142) and returned to baseline by month 9 
in 20070337 and by month 6 in 20110142.  
In both studies, serum concentrations of bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP) and osteocalcin followed 
a similar pattern to P1NP, peaking at month 1 and declining thereafter, with levels near baseline at month 
12. 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 53/263 
  
  
 
 
 
Samples for the bone resorption marker sCTX were collected in the fasted state and at approximately the 
same time of day throughout each study as recommended. sCTX decreased in the romosozumab group early 
in treatment (minimum at day 14) and remained below the baseline level at month 12 in the 20070337 
substudy. In 20110142, sCTX showed a similar decrease at month 1 (time point of first assessment) and 
remained reduced but above the levels in the alendronate group through month 12. 
Romosozumab effects on BTM in men with osteoporosis (study 20110174) were comparable to those in study 
20070337. In both studies, the median percent change from baseline in P1NP was significantly greater in the 
romosozumab group than in the placebo group at month 1 (p<0.001) and month 3 (p<0.001).  
In 20070337, in contrary to the other studies, CTX appears to decrease over the first 12 months also in the 
placebo group. According to the Applicant, this was due to an assay shift due to a change in reagent. Re-
testing of all samples in this study showed greater stability in the placebo group. The same pattern on BTM 
was seen in supportive study 20120156. Study 20080289 evaluated romosozumab effect in subjects with 
prior exposure to bisphosphonates. P1NP rose rapidly with a peak at 14 days after first dose and trended 
back towards baseline over the 12-month treatment period. sCTX declined rapidly and returned to baseline 
by month 3, with levels remaining near baseline for the remaining treatment period. 
Study 20060326 included a 12 months off-treatment phase with denosumab or placebo (month 24-36) 
followed by 12-month retreatment (month 36-48) with romosozumab (Figure 5).

Analysis Set for Subjects Enrolled in the Retreatment Phase) (20060326 Interim Analysis [Month

P1NP   
sCTX 
Follow-up treatment with denosumab after romosozumab discontinuation resulted in a sustained decrease of 
both P1NP and sCTX. Retreatment with romosozumab resulted in a slower but more sustained increase in 
P1NP compared to the initial romosozumab treatment period. As opposed to the initial treatment period, 
there was a slow increase in sCTX towards baseline during retreatment, with sCTX above baseline from 
month 42.  
In study 20110227, the effect of romosozumab in subjects with renal impairment (eGFR 15-29 
ml/min/1.73m2) or haemodialysis compared to healthy subjects was studied. The number of patients in each 
group is very limited (N=8) and the standard deviations was very broad. It is considered that data not fully 
support dosing recommendations in this population.

Sclerostin concentrations 
After a single dose of romosozumab 3 mg/kg, total sclerostin levels increased around 10,000% from baseline 
with a maximum at the first measurement (d 5-8 in 20060223) and slowly returned to baseline.  
Also in the pivotal studies 20070337 and 20110142, sclerostin levels were markedly elevated at the first 
measurement after the first romosozumab administration (20070337 14,700% at day 14; 20110142 8,800% 
at 1 month). The sclerostin levels remained elevated during romosozumab treatment (20070337 14,000% 
and 20110142 11,000% at month 12).  
It is assumed that the elevated levels of sclerostin are driven by romosozumab-bound sclerostin as antibody-
ligand complexes may have a slower clearance than the unbound ligand. According to the Applicant, an assay 
to measure free sclerostin levels in the presence of sclerostin-romosozumab complex is not available, due to 
the complexities encountered when developing such an assay.  
Immunogenicity (pharmacodynamic and clinical aspects) 
Development of ADA 
In phase 1-studies, about 7.9% (66 of 832) of the subjects developed binding antibodies after at least 1 dose 
of romosozumab. All positive subjects showed a persistent binding response with a positive result at the last 
time point tested. Neutralizing antibodies were detected in 2.1% (18 of 832) of all romosozumab dosed 
subjects. 
Incidence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) antibodies in studies the phase 2 and 3 studies in postmenopausal 
women (20070337, 20060326, 20101291, 20120156, 20080289 and 20110142) is presented in Table 4.

overall studies. 
In study 20060326, no new subject developed positive neutralizing anti-romosozumab antibodies during the 
retreatment phase having been previously antibody negative.

Effect of ADA on efficacy 
The change in BMD from baseline was selected as the efficacy marker to evaluate the effect of binding and 
neutralizing antibodies on efficacy.  
The results from phase 3 studies in are given below (20070337 Table 5; 20110142 Table 6).

Status Through Month 18 (Romosozumab Arm in Primary Analysis Set for BMD: Descriptive 
Statistics, Observed Data) (20110142 Primary Analysis Period) 
In studies 20070337 and 20110142, there were no consistent difference in mean percent changes in BMD 
between subjects with neutralising antibodies compared to subjects with no antibodies. In study 20060326, 
only 9 subjects developed neutralising ADA (4 in the 140 mg Q3M treatment group, 5 in the 210 Q3M group 
and 1 in the 210 mg QM group), making any comparisons unreliable. 
As opposed to the effect of neutralising antibodies on group level, there was one report of an abating effect of 
such antibodies on individual level. One subject from phase 1 study 20060220 with positive neutralizing

antibodies was inadvertently enrolled and dosed in a subsequent study (20060221). A rapid decline in 
romosozumab serum concentrations was observed in this subject after the first dose in study 20060221 and 
serum concentrations were not measurable after day 6, despite continued dosing. Consistent with these 
pharmacokinetic data, there were no notable changes in pharmacodynamic markers.  
In the study on male subjects with osteoporosis (20110174), no subject developed neutralising ADA up to 
month 12; however, one subject developed neutralising antibodies during the follow-up period. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics  
Secondary pharmacology has not been specifically investigated in clinical studies and a discussion on this issue 
has not been identified in the dossier. Possible secondary pharmacodynamic effects of romosozumab might be 
mediated via decreased calcium levels. A decrease in calcium levels, followed by increased levels of iPTH could 
be seen, but only in patients with renal impairment signs of hypocalcaemia could be observed. 
Romosozumab is neither expected to affect pharmacodynamic properties of concomitantly administered drugs 
nor  are  concomitant  drugs  expected  to  affect  pharmacodynamic  properties  of  romosozumab;  no  studies  on 
pharmacodynamic  interactions  with  other  medicinal  products  or  substances  have  been  conducted  which  is 
acceptable  as  monoclonal  antibodies  like  romosozumab  are  large  molecules  which  do  not  undergo  renal  or 
hepatic metabolism. Monoclonal antibodies IgG are eliminated by catabolism and, in case of romosozumab, by 
degradation  of  the  romosozumab-sclerostin  complex.  They  are  therefore  not  subject  to  significant  drug 
interactions. There is no evidence to suggest that sclerostin affects the level or activity of inflammatory proteins 
or cytokines that affect CYP-enzyme expression. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Romosozumab shows an expected nonlinearity in the pharmacokinetics. Elimination is target mediated and Fc-
receptor  mediated.  Clearance  is  dependent  on  bodyweight.  The  exposure  is  increased  in  patients  with  low 
weight and reduced in patients with high body weight. Presence of ADAs may give rise to increased clearance 
of romosozumab. However, ADAs appear to interfere with the analysis of romosozumab and ADAs may also be 
detected more often in patients having reduced romosozumab levels. Thus, the actual effect on PK is unknown. 
Limited clinical data available does not indicate loss of efficacy of neutralising ADAs and routine ADA analysis 
is unlikely.  
The applicant has submitted satisfactory results from pre-study validations of the romosozumab bioanalytical 
methods and appropriate assay within-study validation data has been provided. 
A  higher  mean  romosozumab  exposure  has  been  found  in  stage  4  renal  impairment.  Hypocalcaemia  was 
reported in >30% of the subjects with renal impairment. Safety in patients with renal impairment is further 
discussed in the clinical part of the assessment. 
The population PK modelling results indicate that the model describe romosozumab serum concentrations 
well. The model is descriptive of data, although mechanistic interpretations should be made with caution. The 
PK covariate analysis is considered adequate. The popPK analysis identified several significant covariates 
which have been discussed in the appropriate sections.  
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 57/263 
  
  
Pharmacodynamics  
Romosozumab induced a rapid, dose-dependent increase in the bone formation marker P1NP in clinical phase 
2 and 3 studies, in both men and women. In dose-finding studies 20060326 and 20101291, the dosing 
regimen romosozumab 210 mg SC QM, which was used in the pivotal studies and is the proposed posology 
for the commercial product, exerted the largest effect on P1NP. This supports the proposed dosing regimen. 
In spite of continued dosing, the increase in P1NP was transient and returned to baseline after 6-9 months. 
The transient effect of romosozumab on P1NP may represent a regulatory mechanism to prevent excessive 
bone formation. This, together with BMD data discussed in section 3.3.5, supports discontinuing 
romosozumab after a limited time. The decrease in the bone resorption marker sCTX was also transient and 
returned towards baseline by 3 months but remained below baseline through 12 months. This supports the 
proposed duration of treatment of 12 months.  
The effect on sCTX was less dose-dependent compared to bone formation markers, indicating that the 
selected dose of 210 mg QM may promote the most potent bone forming effect, without an increased 
antiresorptive effect compared to lower doses. 
Study 20060326 included a 12 months off-treatment phase with denosumab or placebo (month 24-36) 
followed by 12-month retreatment (month 36-48) with romosozumab. During denosumab treatment, both 
P1NP and sCTX decreased markedly and remained >50% below baseline values at month 36. As there was 
no wash-out period after denosumab/placebo, the BTMs were still considerably lower at the beginning of 
romosozumab retreatment in denosumab treated subjects. This could be an explanation to the somewhat 
divergent effect on BTM with romosozumab retreatment after denosumab compared to untreated subjects. 
This may in part explain the limited effect on BMD with romosozumab retreatment after denosumab (see 
section 3.3.5). 
20080289 included subjects with prior exposure to bisphosphonates. The general effect on BTM indicates that 
previous treatment with bisphosphonates does not impair the effect of romosozumab treatment, which is 
further supported by BMD data (see section 3.3.5). The reason for the differences in effect duration 
compared to studies in bisphosphonate naïve subjects is not fully understood.  
The Applicant proposes that the marked elevation in sclerostin levels (11,000-14,000%) during 
romosozumab treatment represent romosozumab-bound sclerostin, as the concentration profile of sclerostin 
was similar to that of romosozumab. It is agreed that in some cases, antibody-ligand complexes in may have 
a slower clearance than the unbound ligand. According to the Applicant, an assay to measure free sclerostin 
levels in the presence of sclerostin-romosozumab complex is not available, due to the complexities 
encountered when developing such an assay. 
The incidence of binding and neutralizing antibodies in subjects dosed with romosozumab 210 mg QM was 
17.8% and 0.6%, respectively, in the phase 2 and 3 clinical studies in women. In the study on male subjects 
(20110174), no subject developed neutralising ADA up to month 12. 
No consistent effect on BMD of neutralising ADA was seen on group level. However, there was one report of 
an abating effect of such antibodies on individual level.  
Taking into account the relatively low number of neutralising antibodies across the studies (0.8% of all 
romosozumab treated subjects in the 6 phase 2 and 3 studies) and the inconsistency in effect of ADA on 
mean percent change in BMD at different locations, the problem with developing anti-romosozumab 
antibodies in efficacy is considered limited. 
Secondary pharmacology has not specifically been investigated in clinical studies, but romosozumab can cause 
a  range  of  secondary  effects  including  hypocalcaemia.  Romosozumab  is  not  expected  to  affect  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 58/263 
  
  
pharmacodynamics properties of other medicinal products or substances under concomitant treatment nor are 
co-medications expected to alter pharmacodynamics properties of romosozumab, as degradation is mediated 
via catabolism and a specific AMG 785-sclerostin complex and not via renal or hepatic metabolism and sclerostin 
is not known to affect cytokine or CYP enzyme expression. 
Concentration-response 
A concentration-response model was developed to describe the relationship between romosozumab 
concentration, BTMs (P1NP and sCTX), and BMD gains at the lumbar spine. However, the visual predictive 
checks clearly indicate model misspecification. The final model is not considered adequate to make 
conclusions on the relation between plasma concentration and the time course of bone turnover markers. 
Subsequently, in present state, the model should not be used in future applications of romosozumab.  
However, it is not perceived that further model development would change the dosing recommendation in the 
present application. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacodynamic data on bone turnover markers support the proposed romosozumab dosing regimen 
210 mg QM.  
During romosozumab treatment the serum sclerostin levels increase up to 14,000%. This may be an effect of 
a slower elimination of antibody-bound ligand. This cannot be further investigated, as it has not been possible 
to develop an assay to measure free sclerostin levels in the presence of sclerostin-romosozumab complex. 
However, there are no signs of lack-of-efficacy indicative of increased levels of free sclerostin during the 
study. In the seven efficacy/safety phase 2 and 3 studies, the number of neutralising antibodies was low 
(<1%). The effect of such antibodies in bone mineral density was inconsistent. On individual level, there was 
one report of an abating effect of such antibodies. 
Overall the available pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data were found to be adequate for this 
application.

2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Dose-response study 20060326 
Study 20060326 was a randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study in postmenopausal women with 
low BMD. The subjects were treated as described in legend to the table above, and  
Table. 
The TPTD treatment arm was finalised after 12 months and the ALN treatment arm was crossed over to 140 
mg romosozumab QM after 12 months and finalised before the retreatment phase.

The primary analysis was performed at month 12. The primary endpoint was percent change from baseline in 
bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine for the individual romosozumab groups and pooled placebo 
group. Results though 48 months are submitted.  
For all subjects enrolled, the mean age was 66.8 years, 86.4% of subjects were white, and the mean 
baseline lumbar spine and total hip BMD T-scores were -2.29 and -1.53, respectively.  
Table 6: DXA Lumbar Spine BMD Percent Change from Baseline to Month 12 (Primary Efficacy 
Subset) (20060326 12-Month Primary Analysis) 
The primary endpoint was met as all romosozumab treatment arms increased lumbar spine BMD compared to 
placebo (Table 8). The effect was dose-dependent and larger when romosozumab was given QM than Q3M.  
Up to month 24, fracture event rate was comparable between romosozumab (all doses) and placebo 
(14/255; 5.5% vs 2/50; 4.0%). The highest number of fractures (6/50; 8.6%) was seen in the romosozumab 
70 mg group. The limited absolute number of events, especially in the placebo group, precludes firm 
conclusions. 
In a limited number of subjects treated with 210 mg romosozumab QM after a 12 month off-treatment period 
with placebo (N=19) or denosumab (N=16), lumbar spine BMD was determined during a retreatment phase 
with romosozumab (Figure 6).

and 95% CIs (Full Analysis Set for Subjects Enrolled in the Retreatment Phase and Initially 
Randomized to Romosozumab) (20060326 Interim Analysis [Month 48]) 
The effect on lumbar spine BMD of the initial romosozumab treatment was sustained when followed by an 
antiresorptive agent but returned to baseline if treatment was discontinued. Romosozumab retreatment after 
an antiresorptive agent resulted only in limited additional increase in lumbar spine BMD and none in total hip 
and femoral neck. In patients who had discontinued treatment for a year, in contrast, the response to re-
treatment was similar to the initial response. 
The effect on bone turnover markers in this study is discussed in the Pharmacodynamics section. 
Dose-response study 20101291 
Study 20101291 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study in postmenopausal Japanese women with a 
BMD T-score ≤ -2.50 but not ≤ -4.00 at the lumbar spine or ≤ -3.50 at the total hip or femoral neck. Mean 
age was 67.7 years and the mean baseline lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck BMD T-scores 
were -2.70, -1.94 and -2.29, respectively.  
Table 7: Lumbar Spine BMD Percent Change from Baseline at Month 12 
The primary endpoint was met as all romosozumab treatment arms increased lumbar spine BMD compared to 
placebo (Table 9). The effect was dose-dependent.  
At twelve months, there was a statistically significant increase in BMD with 210 mg compared to 70 mg 
romosozumab at total hip (4.7 vs 2.1%; p<0.0001) and femoral neck (3.8 vs 1.9%; p=0.0036) and 
compared to 140 mg romosozumab at total hip (4.7 vs 3.2%; p= 0.0018).

Of the 6 reported treatment-emergent clinical fractures up to month 12, 1 occurred in the placebo group 
(N=63) and 5 occurred in one of the romosozumab groups (N=189). 1 additional fracture was reported in the 
placebo group month 12-15. The number of events is too low to enable a comparison between the 
treatments. 
Impact of the results from both studies on dosing recommendations  
The combined results from studies 20060326 and 20101291 on lumbar spine BMD are shown in Figure 7.  
Figure 7: Lumbar Spine BMD Percent Change from Baseline by Visit Least Squares Means and CIs 
From Repeated Measures Model (Dose-ranging Efficacy Analysis Set) 
Romosozumab 210 mg QM was associated with greater increases in lumbar spine BMD than 70 mg QM and 
140 mg QM. The results on total hip and femoral neck BMD were similar to the results on lumbar spine. 
Efficacy was significantly lower when romosozumab was given in 3-month intervals for both of the Q3M doses 
tested. The same dose-response pattern was seen on bone turnover markers as discussed in the 
Pharmacodynamics section. 
The treatment duration in 20060326 was 24 months (Figure 8).

Figure 8: Lumbar Spine BMD Mean (95% CI) Percent Change From Baseline by Visit (Primary 
Efficacy Subset) (20060326 Month 24 Interim Analysis) 
Lumbar spine BMD continued to increase during the entire treatment period; however, the increase was 
largest during the first 6 months of treatment. The effect on bone turnover markers was partly sustained 
through 12 months as discussed in the Pharmacodynamics section. Based on these results, the treatment 
duration for the subsequent phase 2 and phase 3 studies was decided to 12 months.  
In silico modelling studies 
A dose-response model, to describe the relationship between dose and BMD gains at both lumbar spine and 
total hip (119384B) was provided to support the generated data. 
In study 119384B (dose-BMD modelling) The applicant developed a model to explain the gain in BMD 
depending on dose and covariates (race [Japanese vs. non-Japanese], age, age post menopause, body 
weight, baseline P1NP and baseline sCTX, baseline BMD at lumbar spine or total hip, and prior alendronate or 
denosumab treatment) including a total of 776 women (postmenopausal women with low BMD, Japanese 
women with postmenopausal osteoporosis, women with postmenopausal osteoporosis) from two phase 2 
studies ( 20060326 and 20101291) and a sub study of study 20070337.  The results indicate a dosing 
regimen of 210 mg SC QM provided the greatest and fastest BMD gain compared to the other dosing 
regimens evaluated (mean placebo corrected BMD gains at 12 months at lumbar spine of 11.4% [95%CI: 
10.5 to 12.2] and total hip of 6.0% [95%CI: 5.1 to 6.7]). For a given dose similar BMD response at lumbar 
spine and total hip have been suggested for a monthly and quarterly (3-fold higher) dosing. Romosozumab 
maximal response (Emax) was 31.7% (95%CI: 26.2 to 41.4%) at lumbar spine and 17.0% (95%CI: 14.1 to 
22.9%) at total hip. The half-lives associated with the rate of onset are approximately 5.4 months at lumbar 
spine and 8.25 months at total hip. The final model included the effects of baseline BMD, sCTX, body weight, 
and study on maximal response and prior treatment (alendronate or denosumab) on rate of onset:  
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 65/263 
  
  
 
BMD values greater than or less than 0.76 g/cm2 were associated with lower or higher maximal response 
(0.1 g/cm2 increase or decrease associated with an approximately 5 or 6% decrease or increase).  Baseline 
sCTX values greater than or less than 0.48 ng/mL were associated with higher or lower maximal response. 
Increasing body weight was associated with reduced maximal response at lumbar spine. Study 20070337 had 
a 20% higher maximal response (1.2x [95%CI: 0.967 to 1.44]) at total hip whereas maximal response at 
lumbar spine was the same. Japanese subjects had a higher maximal response at lumbar spine (1.2x 
(95%CI: 1.1 to 1.39) and a lower maximal response at total hip (0.752x (95%CI: 0.581 to 0.917). 
Prior treatment (alendronate or denosumab) slowed the rate of onset for romosozumab treatment effect: 
alendronate at both lumbar spine (half-lives: 19.4 months) and total hip (40.4 months). Denosumab 
treatment showed an effect at lumbar spine (half-life of 6.2 months) and was not estimated for total hip. 
The applicant included data from 393 postmenopausal women with low BMD, 241 Japanese women with 
postmenopausal osteoporosis and 142 women with postmenopausal osteoporosis. The index dataset 
however, contained only data without postmenopausal osteoporosis. The included study population in the 
final dataset corresponds with the intended target population in women. Although the intended target 
patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis are underrepresented and more data for these patients would 
have been preferable, the population is acceptable for the model in women. As the intended indication should 
also include men it would have been favourable to included data for men as well, especially as the PPK 
analysis suggests a higher exposure for men.  
Japanese patients showed a differing response in both lumbar spine and total hip and even opposing effects 
were presented. These changes are small and probably not clinically relevant.  
2.5.2.  Main studies 
The pivotal studies consist of two studies in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis and one bridging 
study in osteoporotic men: 
20070337 (FRAME) was a phase 3, global, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with 
romosozumab 210 mg SC QM for a duration of 12 months in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. 
20110142 (ARCH) was a phase 3, global, randomized, double-blind, alendronate-controlled study with 
romosozumab 210 mg SC QM for a duration of 12 months in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. 
20110174 (BRIDGE) was a phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study with 
romosozumab 210 mg SC QM for a duration of 12 months in men with osteoporosis. 
The two pivotal studies in postmenopausal women are presented together.

Treatments 
The romosozumab dose 210 mg each month was based on the results from the phase 2 dose-ranging studies 
20060326 and 20101291. Protocol required supplementation with calcium/vitamin D as concomitant 
medication. 
To maintain the blind in study 20110142, subjects randomized to romosozumab received placebo for oral 
alendronate QW and subjects randomized to alendronate received placebo for romosozumab SC QM.  After 
the double-blind period, subjects entered an alendronate follow-on study period in which they received oral 
alendronate 70 mg QW in an open-label fashion while remaining blinded to their initial treatment assignment.  
It is noted, that a non-commercial process 2 ATO (70 mg/mL glass PFS presentation) was used in the main 
clinical studies. In contrast, process 2 ARI will be used for commercial manufacturing / PFS and prefilled 
AI/pen with 90 mg/mL romosozumab. This to be commercialised product has been tested in two clinical 
phase I studies (PK equivalence study 20150197 and equivalence study of auto-injector vs. prefilled syringe 
20090418) and in the phase 3 study 20120156. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The co-primary endpoint in 20070337 was the subject incidence of new vertebral fracture at month 12 and 
month 24. 
The primary endpoints in 20110142 were the subject incidence of new vertebral fracture through 24 months 
and the subject incidence of clinical fracture through the primary analysis. 
The secondary fracture endpoints in both studies were the subject incidence of different fractures at different 
time points as summarized in Table 10. Definitions of fracture endpoints are given under the table.

b. In Study 20110142, the testing sequence includes the 2 primary endpoints, 6 BMD endpoints, and then the endpoint for 
non-vertebral fracture through the primary analysis. 
New vertebral fractures occurred when there was ≥ 1 grade increase from the previous grade of 0 in any 
vertebra from T4 to L4 on the Genant Semiquantitative Scoring Method. 
Clinical fractures included symptomatic vertebral and non-vertebral fractures (excluding skull, facial, 
mandible, metacarpus, finger phalanges, and toe phalanges). Clinical vertebral fractures were included 
regardless of trauma severity or pathologic fractures; non-vertebral fractures associated with high trauma 
severity or pathologic fractures were excluded. 
Non-vertebral fracture was defined as a fracture present on a copy of radiographs or other diagnostic images, 
excluding skull, facial, mandible, cervical vertebrae, thoracic vertebrae, lumbar vertebrae, metacarpus, finger 
phalanges, and toe phalanges. In addition, fractures associated with high trauma severity or pathologic 
fractures were excluded. 
Major non-vertebral fracture was a subset of non-vertebral fractures including pelvis, distal femur (i.e., femur 
excluding hip), proximal tibia (i.e., tibia excluding ankle), ribs, proximal humerus (i.e., humerus excluding 
elbow), forearm, and hip. 
Hip fracture was a subset of non-vertebral fractures including femur neck, femur intertrochanter, and femur 
subtrochanter. 
Major osteoporotic fractures included hip, forearm, or humerus fractures that were not associated with a 
pathologic fracture regardless of trauma severity, and clinical vertebral fractures. 
Secondary bone mineral density (BMD) endpoints are summarised in Table 11.

Overall, from the romosozumab-licensure perspective, the focus chosen in study 20110142 to primarily 
investigate fracture protection advantages of a romosozumab-ALN treatment sequence over an ALN-alone 
treatment after a treatment period of 24 months is not considered optimal. Aside this non-optimality in 
definition of trial objective and primary endpoints, there is a high level of complexity coming from 
terminology and statistical analysis strategy, which aggravates reading and interpretation of the fracture data 
analyses. From a planning perspective, many conditions were set up to define when different analyses for 
different fracture endpoints were planned to be carried out, in varying analyses sets. Corresponding 
explanations are hard to follow, as throughout protocol, SAP and CSR the term ‘primary analysis’ is used in a 
non-consistent manner, as it sometimes refers to the actual analysis of primary endpoints, but sometimes 
also just to the point in time when primary endpoints are evaluated (mentioned for the analyses of actual 
secondary endpoints).  As, from an assessment perspective, implications from these findings primarily 
concern the discussion of study results on secondary fracture endpoints (e.g. non-vertebral fractures), the 
efforts required to clarify all methodological/terminology issues in this regard are not considered worthwhile.  
Sample size 
The initially planned total sample size in study 20070337 was 5,600 subjects. The sample size was driven by 
the non-vertebral fracture endpoint and when study objectives were extended through month 24 (protocol 
amendment 1, 01 August 2012) the sample size was increased to 6,000 subjects (3,000 per arm).  
Due to monitoring of fracture rate during the study by the sponsor, it was observed that the pooled non-
vertebral fracture rate was 12.5% (relative) lower than expected under the original protocol assumptions of 
the incidence of non-vertebral fracture in the placebo group. Based on monitored pooled fracture rates, the 
final sample size was once again increased to a total of 6,600 subjects in Protocol Amendment 4 (18 
September 2013), using assumptions of 2.1% (vs 2.4%) for new vertebral fracture rate and 3.5% (vs 4.0%) 
for non-vertebral fracture rate in the placebo group during the 12-month double-blind study period. However, 
there remained an open question concerning trial integrity based on the too limited information regarding the 
implemented monitoring of fracture data throughout the trial. The fact that sample size changes introduced 
by amendment 4 where triggered by monitoring of pooled/blinded fracture incidence data is of concern, as 
the mentioned monitoring was formally introduced by the very same amendment 4.  
From the descriptions provided in the dossier it did not became clear what kind of monitoring of efficacy 
(fracture data) was done, when and how it was implemented, and which measures were foreseen to protect 
trial integrity as regards trial conduct (e.g. keeping the blind) and data analysis (no inflation of type-1-error 
by unplanned interim looks). With the answer provided, the Applicant describes interim trial analyses of 
blinded non-vertebral fracture occurrence data based on e-CRFs during trial conduct, seemingly without basis 
of an analysis plan for that particular purpose. Prior to Amendment 4, there is no study document which 
addresses the potential need for a sample size reassessment based on ongoing monitoring of pooled/blinded 
fracture data. In this context, the potential for unblinding is the most important aspect of concern related to 
the question of trial integrity. Concerning the measures taken to keep the trial blinded, the Company’s reply 
is acknowledged. However, other related aspects related pertain to unbiasedness of estimates and adequate 
(non-inflated) type-1-error control, in particular in relation to results presented for the final (primary) efficacy 
analyses. Given the lack of planning documentation, of how to carry out the blinded review of (pooled) non-
vertebral fracture occurrence data prior to writing Amendment 4, there still remained an uncertainty in this 
regard. The Company was therefore asked to confirm that all decisions taken for subsequent trial conduct 
following these (formally unplanned pre-amendment 4) analyses had had no relevant impact on the 
interpretation of the efficacy results. With their answer the Applicant confirmed that no unblinding occurred 
as a result of the sample size increase described in 20070337 Protocol Amendment 4 Section 10.2.5 or the 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 72/263 
  
  
monitoring of pooled fracture rate following the implementation of this protocol amendment (refer to 
20070337 Protocol Amendment 4 Section 10.2.4). The only data used was the blinded recruitment pattern 
and the blinded pooled information about accumulated fracture numbers. In addition, the Applicant clarified 
that no interim analysis (regardless whether formal or informal) was conducted and that, at no time, any 
odds ratio, risk ratio, or treatment-specific incidence was calculated based on the randomization code. Also, 
no statistical tests were executed and thus there was no need to adjust the alpha-level for confirmatory 
testing.  
To provide further evidence that the decision to increase the sample size did not introduce a bias, additional 
post-hoc analyses were performed on subsets of subjects enrolled before and after Protocol Amendment 4. 
For non-vertebral fractures the Applicant concluded that the subset of patients enrolled before issuing of 
Protocol Amendment 4 [Subset 1] is mirroring the trending treatment differences seen in the full study 
result. With their reasonably extended answer, the Applicant confirmed that all decisions taken for 
subsequent conduct of study 20070337 following formally unplanned pre-amendment 4 analyses have no 
relevant impact on the interpretation of the efficacy results. Given the answer provided, concerns regarding 
damaged trial integrity are sufficiently alleviated.  
In study 20110142 the sample size was estimated to approximately 4,000 subjects (2,000 per treatment 
arm). For new vertebral fractures the one-year incidence was expected to be 5.5%. Treatment with 
romosozumab/alendronate was expected to decrease the incidence of new vertebral fractures by 80%, 
representing a risk reduction of 50% compared to alendronate treatment alone. 
The one-year incidence rate of non-vertebral fractures was expected to be 5.5%. Based on the alendronate 
treatment assumption, 25% risk reduction, the one-year non-vertebral incidence rate was expected to be 
approximately 4% when treated with alendronate.  
Further, treatment with romosozumab/alendronate compared with alendronate alone was expected to reduce 
the risk of clinical fractures (non-vertebral fractures and clinical vertebral fractures) by approximately 30%. 
Under this assumption, subjects would need to be followed until the 330th subject had a confirmed clinical 
fracture to achieve a 90% power to detect the treatment effect using a 2-sided log-rank test at an overall 
significance level of 0.05. 
Power calculations were also performed for the DXA BMD endpoints; using a two-sample t-test the power for 
each DXA BMD endpoint was >99%.

In study 20070337 eligible subjects were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive either romosozumab or 
matched placebo in a blinded fashion for the duration of the 12-month double-blind placebo-controlled study 
period. Randomisation was stratified by age (< 75 years, ≥ 75 years) and prevalent vertebral fracture (yes, 
no) as determined by site staff at randomisation based on local reading of the spine X-ray.  
In study 20110142 eligible subjects were randomised 1:1 to receive either romosozumab or alendronate 
based on a randomisation schedule prepared by the Amgen Central Randomization Group before the start of 
the study. Randomisation was stratified by age (< 75 years, ≥ 75 years).  
Blinding (masking) 
Both studies were to be performed in a double-blind manner. 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 73/263 
  
  
In study 20070337, each study centre received blinded study boxes that contained either 3 single-use, 
prefilled syringes (PFS) of romosozumab 70 mg/mL or 3 single-use PFSs of matched placebo. Blinded boxes 
of investigational product were assigned to specific subjects by box numbers obtained from the IVRS. After 
the 12-month double-blind placebo-controlled study period, subjects entered the 12-month open-label 
denosumab follow-up while still remaining blinded to their initial treatment assignment (romosozumab or 
placebo). 
Besides treatment with either romosozumab or alendronate in study 20110142, subjects also received 
matched placebo for either alendronate or romosozumab. After the initial 12-month study period subjects 
received alendronate but were to remain blinded to their initial treatment assignment (romosozumab or 
alendronate); initial treatment assignments were not to be revealed until the study had ended.  
In both studies, the assessment of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures and readings of DXA scans was 
performed centrally using a central imaging vendor. For assessment of incident vertebral fracture, readers 
were blinded to treatment assignment but not sequence. The imaging vendor charter for study 20070337 had 
been submitted. For study 20110142, no separate charter had been found. Upon request, the Applicant 
clarified that the same central imaging vendor as used for study 20070337 was used also for study 
20110142. With their response, the imaging vendor charter for study 20110142 was submitted. 
Also, and applying to both the studies, to maintain the blind on-study data including e.g. serum calcium, 
albumin-adjusted calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, romosozumab levels, sclerostin and anti-
romosozumab antibodies was not to be reported to any study-related personnel.  
Statistical methods 
In study 20070337, the primary analysis was, according to what had been planned, performed when all 
subjects had had the opportunity to complete the month 24 study visit. 
In study 20110142, the primary analysis period was to end and the primary analysis performed when clinical 
fracture events (non-vertebral fracture or clinical vertebral fracture) had been confirmed for at least 330 
subjects and all subjects had had the opportunity to complete their Month 24 study visit. 
All the fracture-related efficacy endpoints were based on the results from the central imaging vendor 
analysis. 
The analysis plan for study 20070337 and study 20110142 respectively shared a number of features. 
Changes made to each of the study SAP have been accounted for. The final SAP for study 20070337 was 
dated January 19, 2016. In study 20010142, changes to the SAP were made before the primary analysis data 
snapshot date of 27 February 2017.  The date for database lock and unblinding had not been found for any of 
the studies. The Applicant provided the requested dates showing that (initial) unblinding in each study was 
conducted after approval of the (final) SAP. For each study respectively, the Applicant further stated that the 
primary analysis snapshot reflected a complete and accurate copy of the clinical study database at the date 
of snapshot. At the time of the primary analysis, neither the study 20070337 nor study 20110142 databases 
were locked. The Applicant’s review of data changes that occurred in the database after the primary analysis 
identified minor changes in data for both studies without, however, implying any meaningful changes to the 
primary and key safety results previously reported in the Primary Analysis Clinical Study Reports for either 
study.  
For study 20070337, the primary analysis data cut-off date was 14 December 2015 and the date for primary 
analysis snapshot and approval to unblind Amgen staff was 12 February 2016. The date for final approval of 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 74/263 
  
  
the SAP was 19 January 2016. For study 20110142, the data cut-off date for the primary analysis was 27 
February 2017 and the date for primary analysis snapshot and approval to unblind independent statistics 
team that performed the analysis was 18 April 2016. The date for final approval of the SAP was 7 April 2017.  
The analyses planned and performed are overall acceptable. The approach to missing data and missing data 
imputation seemed however to deserve some consideration and clarifications and additional analyses were 
requested.  
The Primary Efficacy Analysis Set for Vertebral Fracture included all randomised subjects who had a baseline 
and at least one post-baseline evaluation of vertebral fracture at or before the time point under 
consideration. Subjects with missing baseline Genant semi-quantitative scores were included in the primary 
efficacy subset if their first post-baseline spinal radiograph showed no fracture on the same vertebra, as they 
were assumed to have had no fracture of that vertebra at baseline. This analysis set was used as the primary 
analysis set for new, new or worsening, and multiple new or worsening vertebral fractures endpoints. 
The Full Analysis Set included all randomised subjects and was used as the primary analysis set for e.g. non-
vertebral fracture, clinical fracture, major non-vertebral fracture, major osteoporotic fracture and hip fracture 
efficacy endpoints. 
Subject incidence of new vertebral fracture was analysed using logistic regression and any missing post-
baseline vertebral fracture status due to missing x-ray assessment was imputed using the status from the 
last non-missing post-baseline visit. This was justified by that a vertebral fracture can only get worse or at 
best remains at the same severity over time i.e., once a vertebral fracture is identified, the subsequent spinal 
radiographs will always show fracture. While agreed in case a subject was found to have a vertebral fracture, 
the approach of carrying forward an early assessment if later assessments were missing in case a fracture 
was not found is however not that evident. To be included in the primary analysis set a subject was required 
to have both a baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment. In support of primary analyses, analyses 
based on the FAS for time-to-first new vertebral fracture using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model 
were performed. It seemed however as if LOCF was used also in this analysis. This needed to be clarified and 
if event status (fracture/no fracture), if missing, was carried forward to the end of the analysis period, an 
analysis of time to first new vertebral fracture through month 12 and month 24 (20070337) and through 
month 24 (20110142) respectively were to be repeated based on FAS without last observation carried 
forward and using appropriate censoring rules in case of a subject’s early withdrawal from study and/or in 
case of missing assessments. In response to the above request, the Applicant acknowledged that the term 
last observation carried forward (LOCF) in the context of the Cox regression analysis for new vertebral 
fractures was misleading and confirmed that established definitions for censoring and first occurrence of 
event were applied in time-to-event analyses; no concern is raised, and no additional sensitivity analyses are 
needed.  
For both studies, further supportive analyses, among them an analysis based on the PP set, were planned 
and have been performed, none of which however offered conservative or alternative methods for missing 
data imputation. Since stratification differed >5% in study 20070337, an analysis was performed using 
“verified strata”. This analysis is endorsed as for completeness; the impact on the outcomes was small.  In 
study 20110142, the only stratification factor was age and the difference in verified and randomised stratum 
concerned only 0.1% of the whole study population why the estimates from the analysis based on verified 
stratification were more or less identical to the result seen in the primary analysis. The primary analysis was 
further repeated based on the PP analysis set implying that the same approach for missing data imputation 
as was used in the primary analysis (i.e. LOCF) was used also here. 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 75/263 
  
  
Time-to-event methods were used for the analyses of other fracture endpoints and were based on the full 
analysis set that included all randomised subjects which is endorsed. However, not many details regarding 
censoring rules had been found; in summary, subjects with no event of interest were to be censored for 
analysis of that event at the end of the analysis period of interest. This is appropriate in subjects who 
completed each analysis period without having a fracture. How censoring was applied in the time-to-event 
analyses in case of a subject’s early withdrawal from study and missed visits was unclear. Upon request, the 
Applicant clarified that the censoring date for each study subject depended from her individual study duration 
and hence, that for patients dropping out earlier, their actual study end date was taken into account in the 
analysis. This is agreed to be the appropriate handling of censoring. 
Also, for the analysis of subject incidence of clinical fracture (a primary endpoint in study 20110142, a 
secondary endpoint in study 20070337) based on Cox proportional hazards model, it had been stated that 
missing values for clinical vertebral fractures were imputed by carrying forward the last non-missing post-
baseline value prior to the missing value. Given this and the lack of details regarding censoring, the Applicant 
was requested to clarify how and when LOCF was used in time-to-event analyses whereby the Applicant 
clarified that subject incidence of clinical fracture was analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model 
without using LOCF. 
For the BMD endpoints, primary analyses were performed using ANCOVA (LOCF) with additional analyses 
performed using MMRM. Since MMRM analyses addresses the treatment effect if all patients would have been 
fully adherent, sensitivity analyses not relying on missing at random were requested. In response, the 
Applicant has provided sensitivity analyses using a control-based pattern multiple imputation approach for 
missing data instead of last observation carried forward. These sensitivity analyses are supported. Although 
estimated treatment differences are smaller compared with the pre-planned initially presented analyses, they 
confirm superior efficacy of the romosozumab arm versus the control arm in each of the studies (placebo in 
study 20070337 and alendronate in study 20110142).  These analyses were based on all randomised 
subjects (i.e. the Full analysis Set) applying a method to handle missing data that is considered reasonable 
conservative. 
In both studies methods for multiplicity adjustment were applied to maintain the overall 2-sided familywise 
error rate at 0.05 for the primary and secondary endpoints. Both studies a fixed-sequence testing procedure 
was used accounting also for multiplicity using the Hochberg procedure. Regarding the use of Hochberg 
within steps with two tests, in case only one of the analyses had been successful, the strategy had been less 
optimal since there had been no alpha to pass on to secondary endpoints. 
In study 20070337, the sequential Testing Procedure included the following steps: 
Step 1: Subject incidence of new vertebral fracture through month 12 and through month 24 (co-primary 
endpoints; nominal p-value for each endpoint < 0.05) 
Step 2: Subject incidence of clinical fracture through month 12 
Step 3: Subject incidence of non-vertebral fracture through month 12 and through month 24, using Hochberg 
procedure at 0.05 level within the step 
Step 4: Subject incidence of clinical fracture through month 24 
Step 5: Subject incidence of major non-vertebral fracture through month 12 and through month 24, using 
Hochberg procedure at 0.05 level within the step 
Step 6: Subject incidence of new or worsening vertebral fracture through month 12 and through month 24, 
using Hochberg procedure at 0.05 level within the step 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 76/263 
  
  
Step 7: Subject incidence of hip fracture through month 12 and through month 24, using Hochberg 
procedure at 0.05 level within the step 
No further adjustment for multiplicity was planned implying nominal p-values for analyses of other 
secondary, exploratory endpoints and sub study endpoints. 
In study 20110142, the primary endpoints were tested at the 0.05 level (2-sided), accounting for multiplicity 
using the Hochberg procedure. If both primary endpoints were significant at the 0.05 level, each of the 
following secondary DXA BMD endpoints were to be tested hierarchically at 0.05 according to the following 
sequence: percent change from baseline in BMD at lumbar spine at Month 24, percent change from baseline 
in BMD at total hip at Month 24, percent change from baseline in BMD at femoral neck at Month 24, percent 
change from baseline in BMD at lumbar spine at Month 12, percent change from baseline in BMD at total hip 
at Month 12, and percent change from baseline in BMD at femoral neck at Month 12. If all preceding 
endpoints had been significant, the non-vertebral fracture endpoint was to be tested using a group sequential 
approach at the primary analysis and the final analysis based on a 1-sided test (α = 0.025). The Lan-DeMets 
alpha spending function that approximates a Pocock boundary will be used to determine the significance level 
at the time of the primary analysis. 
In both studies, additional supportive analyses were planned and have been performed in order to 
demonstrate the robustness of the results from the primary analysis.  
Results 
Participant flow  
In 20070337, a total of 16,716 subjects were screened for the study and 7,180 were randomized to the 
romosozumab 210 mg and placebo groups. 
In 20110142, a total of 16,916 subjects were screened for participation in the study and 4,093 subjects were 
randomized to the romosozumab 210 mg QM and alendronate 70 mg QW treatment groups.  
A total of 32 subjects in 20110142 and 139 subjects in 20070337 discontinued the study due to “other reasons”. 
The  reasons  for  subjects  discontinuing  the  study  within  this  category  varied,  with  the  majority  related  to 
personal reasons, moving or logistical issues, or ineligible for the extension period of the study. Only 4 events 
in romosozumab subjects have been due to an AE. These AEs are however already listed in the AE profiles of 
the respective studies.

Baseline data 
Table 11: Baseline Demographics in Pivotal Fracture Studies (Full Analysis Set) 
In both studies, the treatment arms were well balanced regarding age, ethnicity, race and BMI. Subjects in 
20110142 were approximately 4 years older than in 20070337 and more subjects were ≥75 years old.  
Baseline disease characteristics are summarised in Table 14.

Table 12: Key Baseline Disease Characteristics in Pivotal Fracture Studies (Full Analysis Set) 
The baseline disease characteristics are generally well balanced between the treatment arms in both pivotal 
studies.  
Consistent with the differences in inclusion and exclusion criteria, the percentages of subjects with a history 
of osteoporosis-related fractures and prevalent vertebral fractures were higher in 20110142, whereas the 
BMD T-score in all locations were higher in 20070337. 
The  10-year  probability  of  a  major  osteoporotic  and  hip  fracture,  according  to  the  FRAX,  was  also  similar 
between treatment groups, whereas generally lower in Central/Latin America, reflecting a population with a 
lower fracture risk. The CHMP guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products in the treatment of primary 
osteoporosis  (CPMP/EWP/552/95  Rev.  2)  puts  an  emphasis  on  the  study  of  patients  at  high  risk  of  fracture 
preferably  expressing  the  10-year  probability  of  fracture  in  line  with  the  recommendations  of  the  WHO;  for 
spine fracture probability of 15% to 20%, for hip fracture of 5% to 7.5%, for major non-vertebral fracture of 
10%  to  15%  are  given  as  inclusion  criteria.  In  study  20070337  the  mean  10-year  probabilities  of  major 
osteoporotic  fractures  and  of  hip  fractures  calculated  with  femoral  neck  BMD  were  13.4%  (range:  2.7%  to 
69.7%) and 5.9% (range: 0.3% to 57.9%), respectively for the overall population.  When looking on the FRAX 
data of the Central/Latin America population (which accounts for over 43%), a generally lower mean 10-year 
probability of major osteoporotic fractures and of hip fractures can be observed, 8,7% for major non-vertebral 
fractures and 3,9% for hip fractures, respectively. This was driven by a substantially lower incidence of previous

fractures,  and  a  moderately  lower  incidence  of  parental  hip  fracture,  current  smoking  status,  secondary 
osteoporosis, and alcohol use. According to the Applicant, a number of reports in the scientific literature have 
indicated that lower non-vertebral fracture risk and FRAX scores in women from the Central/Latin American 
region is not unusual when considering similar ages and T-scores of the population in other countries.

*Given number of subjects in Per protocol set reflects complete exclusion, i.e. exclusion of the subject throughout the12-

the subject data after the first event leading to exclusion). 
In the Primary analysis set for BMD in 20070337, approximately 88% of the FAS were included at 12 Months 
and approximately 80% at Month 24. In 20110142, approximately 86% of the FAS were included in the 
Primary analysis set for BMD.  
The reasons for the relatively high discrepancy between the FAS and the Primary analysis sets (at least in the 
BMD analysis set) was not explicitly described but, based on the definition of each set, due to missing 
assessments, either at baseline and/or post-baseline. Although a rather high proportion of randomised 
subjects were excluded in e.g. the analyses of BMD endpoints, the exclusion rates were of the same size 
comparing randomised treatment groups irrespective of study. The applicant was requested to clarify how 
many subjects had missing assessments at each assessment time-point. In response to the above together 
with a request regarding clarification of the use of last-observation-carried-forward (LOCF) approach used in 
the fracture analyses, the Applicant clarified (for both studies) that LOCF imputation was only used at the 
vertebra level and not for completely missing x-rays. A summary of evaluable x-rays by nominal visit and 
treatment group was provided showing very similar patterns comparing the treatment groups. In study 
20070337, the percentages of only partially available x-ray results per visit were all below 10%, in study 
20110142 the percentages of only partially available x-ray results per visit were 11.6% for Month 12 and 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 82/263 
  
  
below 7% for Month 24. Irrespective of study, they were comparable between both treatment groups at all 
time-points. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Study 20070337 met its co-primary endpoints as romosozumab reduced the subject incidence of new 
vertebral fractures compared with placebo during the 12-month double-blind period and through month 24 
after both groups transitioned to denosumab. 
Study 20110142 met both of its two primary endpoints as romosozumab/alendronate reduced subject 
incidence of new radiological vertebral fractures through month 24 and clinical fractures trough primary 
analysis period compared to alendronate only. 
New radiological vertebral fractures 
Table 15:  Subject Incidence of New Vertebral Fracture in studies 20070337 and 20110142 
Through Month 12 and Through Month 24 With Inference Based on Odds Ratio (Primary Efficacy 
Analysis Set for Vertebral Fractures, LOCF Imputation) 
A consistent treatment effect was found across nearly all subgroup analyses for the new vertebral fracture 
endpoints in both studies.   
The chosen primary endpoint in study 20070337, the subject incidence of new vertebral fracture after 
romosozumab treatment compared with placebo, is aligned with CHMP guidance (CPMP/EWP/552/95 Rev. 2) 
and represents in principle the established measure of efficacy for the treatment of postmenopausal 
osteoporosis. The first component of the co-primary endpoint is considered suitable to analyse the efficacy of 
romosozumab in the time window of intended treatment duration, i.e. 0 - 12 months (induction of fracture-
protective effect). However, the second component of the co-primary endpoint, the vertebral fracture 
incidence during the (first) 24-months study period is not considered adequate to directly assess the 
maintenance of fracture protection after romosozumab cessation. This is because fracture events observed 
during the first year of treatment are counted again in this data analysis, and any relevant treatment effect 
already identified in the first year might suffice to reveal a significant result also for the co-primary 24-
months analysis, even if there was no fracture protective effect after month 12.  
In order to better support the persistence of the fracture-protective efficacy after cessation of romosozumab, 
the Applicant was asked to provide additional statistical evaluation of fracture data collected after treatment 
switch to denosumab (i.e. defining the 12-month time point as baseline for the analyses of effect 
maintenance). This additional analysis was to be carried out for the endpoints as defined in the sequential 
testing hierarchy. An additional statement was to be provided to indicate at which step hierarchical testing 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 83/263 
  
  
 
would have stopped, if the testing of fracture incidence between months 12 and 24 would have been taken to 
replace all statistical tests based on 0-24-month data. The Applicant provided the additional analyses as 
requested.

Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 84/263 
  
  
 
Whilst the mentioned potential methodological deficiencies of this post-hoc analyses of the second-year 
fracture-incidences are acknowledged, the additional information provided however further supports the 
(general) assumption of persistence of the fracture-protective efficacy after cessation of romosozumab. 
Results provided indicate that the original co-primary efficacy analysis is not strongly dominated by month 12 
outcome only. Similar to outcome for the Month 0-12 treatment period, the point estimate for the relative 
fracture risk reduction for the Month 12-24 study period (i.e. effect size) is smallest for the category of non-
vertebral fractures. 
Likewise, as regards investigation of maintenance of protective effect after cessation of romosozumab 
treatment under continued ALN treatment, it would seem most logical to take month 12 status as new 
baseline for data analysis, also in the ARCH trial.  Whereas the CSR provides such information of ALN-
controlled 12 months efficacy data, separate data analyses to support maintenance of persistent fracture-
protective effect of romosozumab under ALN treatment was required. The Applicant provided the additional 
analyses separated by year- study time intervals as requested. See Table 19 below. It can be agreed to the 
Applicant that the statistical evaluation of fracture data collected after the treatment switch to alendronate is 
supporting the hypothesis, that extended fracture risk benefit can be achieved in the subsequent time period 
following romosozumab treatment cessation. However, such a finding should be differentiated from any 
benefit-claim directly associated with subsequent antiresorptive therapy, which is not a matter of primary 
assessment in this MAA. As for the FRAME trial, estimated effect size in both periods (Month 0-12, Month 12-
24) seems least pronounced in the category of non-vertebral fractures.

Sensitivity analyses demonstrated consistent results for both studies.  
Like the co-primary endpoints, also selected secondary efficacy endpoints were tested in a fixed sequence 
approach to control for multiplicity. Accordingly, the remaining endpoints in the testing sequence were not 
formally tested for statistical significance. That means that a statistically significant difference in favour of 
romosozumab versus placebo could formally not be demonstrated for non-vertebral or hip fractures. 
However, it is noted, that non-vertebral fracture accounted for the largest share (>85%) in the combined 
endpoint “clinical fracture” and statistical significance was demonstrated for this outcome. 
Of note, forearm fractures, consisting predominantly of wrist fractures, were the most frequently reported 
type of non-vertebral fracture reported in both treatment groups.

s.  8 subjects experienced a lower leg with ankle fracture, specifically, as an ankle fracture in 4 of 8 subjects and as a fracture of the proximal tibia in 4 of 8 
subjects. 
t.  a The Primary Analysis was performed on 464 subjects who experienced a clinical fracture after a median treatment time of 2.7 years (minimum to 
maximum: 1 day to 4.6 years). 
In study 20070337, 5 additional non-vertebral fractures were reported up to month 12, which were not 
confirmed within 14 days by radiographs, other diagnostic imaging techniques or appropriate medical reports. 
Three of the additional fractures were reported in the placebo group (1 rib, 2 radius) and two in the 
romosozumab group (both rib). In study 20110142, 8 additional fractures were reported in six subjects in the 
alendronate treatment arm (3 femoral neck, 1 foot, 1 patella, 1 other, 2 radius) and 8 events in 7 subjects in 
the romosozumab arm (1 carpal, 2 femoral neck, 1 metatarsal, 1 other and 3 rib) up to month 12.

The numbers of non-vertebral fracture events were generally low. In 20070337, hip fractures had occurred in 
totally 20 subjects through month 12 (romosozumab 0.2%, placebo 0.4%). The corresponding figures for 
study 20110142 through month 12 were 0.7% and 1.1%, respectively.

Table 24: Subject Incidence of Non-vertebral Fracture Through Month 12 by Region (Full Analysis 
Set; study 20070337) 
A consistent treatment effect was found across all subgroup analyses in 20110142. However, in 20070337 at 
month 12, but not at month 24, a significant treatment-by-region interaction was noted for the non-vertebral 
fracture endpoint, and therefore also for the clinical fracture endpoint, as non-vertebral fractures accounted 
for the largest share of clinical fractures. The by-region interaction identified a regional difference in placebo 
fracture incidence (i.e., unexpected low fracture rate in the placebo group in Central/Latin America, the 
region with highest enrolment) that affected the non-vertebral fracture outcome for the study overall (Table 
26). In a post hoc subgroup analysis that excluded Central/Latin America data to derive a patient subset from 
all other regions combined (rest-of-world), the non-vertebral fracture rate was 2.7% in the placebo group 
and 1.6% in the romosozumab group (RRR 42%, ARR 1.1%, p=0.012, post hoc). The Applicant has clarified 
that the baseline characteristics in the study are still balanced between the treatment groups in the rest-of-
world subject subset, i.e. after excluding the Central/Latin America subjects. This needs to be seen in context 
of the FRAX risk differences at baseline. The 10-year probability of a major osteoporotic fracture according to 
the FRAX was generally lower in the region Central/Latin America compared to the rest of the study 
population.  
Patient-reported and Clinician-reported Outcomes 
No consistent or clinically meaningful differences in PRO/ClinRO endpoints were identified between the 
romosozumab and placebo or alendronate groups. Post-fracture data were obtained through at months 1, 2, 
and 3 for subjects who had a clinical fracture on study using the pre-fracture baseline for comparison.

Bone mineral density  
Table 25: Bone Mineral Density Percent Change from Baseline at Month 12 in the Pivotal Fracture 
Studies (ANCOVA Model) (Primary Efficacy Analysis Set for BMD, LOCF) 
In both studies, romosozumab increased DXA BMD through month 12 at all locations compared to placebo 
(20070337) and alendronate (20110142).  
In the analyses through month 12 in study 20070337, treatment differences across demographic subgroups 
(i.e., age and geographic region) ranged from 12.0% to 14.4% for the lumbar spine and from 4.7% to 6.6% 
for the total hip and were more or less consistent with the treatment differences observed for the overall 
population (12.7% for lumbar spine and 5.8% for total hip at month 12). It is however noticed, that increase 
of BMD at total hip was most pronounced in the region Central/Latin America with a treatment difference of 
6.6% at month 12. For the very same region no reduction in the non-vertebral fracture rate was seen in the 
romosozumab group compared to the placebo arm. This finding could question the relationship between 
fracture risk reduction and increasing BMD under treatment with romosozumab. Therefore, the Applicant was 
requested to discuss this further. The Applicant has clarified that Central/Latin American study patients is a 
subset where BMD-increase does not in 1 year translate to clinically relevant (non-vertebral) fracture risk 
reduction. According to the Applicant this could be due to the fact that the background fracture rate and 
fracture risk were too low to be able to detect a meaningful difference. As the fracture risk in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 95/263 
  
  
 
Central/Latin American population was comparable to the fracture rate observed in premenopausal women, 
this might be a comprehensible explanation.  
After transition to denosumab, the DXA BMD in the romosozumab/denosumab group continued to increase, 
albeit less than in the placebo/denosumab group; however, the total increase in DXA BMD at month 24 was 
higher in the romosozumab/denosumab arm. This indicates that the effect of denosumab is not potentiated 
by romosozumab treatment compared to placebo. The same pattern was seen with 
romosozumab/alendronate compared to alendronate alone.  
In post hoc responder analyses demonstrated that romosozumab improved BMD from baseline to month 12 
in 98.9% of subjects at the lumbar spine in 20070337 and in 98.4% in 20110142. In both studies, just over 
68% of the romosozumab treated subjects had an increase from baseline in lumbar spine BMD at month 12 
of ≥ 10%, irrespective of a lower baseline lumbar spine BMD T-score in 20110142. 
Ancillary analyses 
The percent change from baseline in DXA BMD at month 6 and month 18 was evaluated as part of predefined 
substudies (Lumbar Spine and Proximal Femur DXA substudy [Imaging II substudy] in 20070337 and 
Imaging and PK/BTM/Biomarker Substudy in 20110142).

(Primary Analysis) 
The results on DXA BMD up to month 24 are similar to the results of the significantly larger main studies. The 
findings are also consistent with pooled data from studies 20060326, 20101291 and 20120156 through 6 and 
12 months in subjects treated with 210 mg romosozumab compared to placebo.  
Forearm and Total Body DXA and HR-pQCT substudy (Imaging Substudy I) 
A total of 95 randomized subjects from 20070337 enrolled, representing all regions except Central and 
Eastern Europe.  Statistically significant increases in total body BMD were seen at all time points comparing 
romosozumab to placebo in the first 12 months and romosozumab/denosumab to placebo/denosumab month 
12-24. 
Romosozumab (months 6 and 12) and romosozumab/denosumab (months 18 and 24) did not have a 
significant impact on BMD in the forearm, as evaluated by DXA BMD at the distal 1/3 radius and total radius. 
BMD in the forearm was even lower in subjects who received 12 months of romosozumab treatment 
compared with those who received placebo. Consistent with the results for radius BMD by DXA, evaluation of 
the radius by HR-pQCT did not show significant differences in the double-blind period between romosozumab 
and placebo for volumetric BMD (total, cortical, trabecular).  
Potential explanations to this finding could be the non-weight bearing nature of this skeletal site and the 
documented less responsivity of the distal radius for all pharmacological therapies for osteoporosis. Actually, 
even decreases in BMD at the distal radius during osteoporosis treatment have been reported in literature 
(Cosman et al, 2015). A conclusive interpretation of the fracture protective effect of romosozumab on 
forearm fractures remains however unclear due to the limited number of patients with forearm fractures in 
both 20070337 and the respective substudy. 
At the distal tibia, romosozumab significantly increased total BMD (month 12), cortical BMD (month 12), and 
cortical thickness (month 6 and month 12) during the double-blind period compared with placebo, while the 
percent changes from baseline in trabecular BMD, trabecular bone volume to tissue volume, trabecular 
separation, and trabecular thickness did not differ significantly between the groups. 
Imaging and PK/BTM/Biomarker substudy 
Integral (total) and trabecular volumetric bone mineral density was measured by QCT in 76 subjects in the 
20110142 substudy. Romosozumab increased integral (total) BMD and trabecular volumetric BMD at the 
lumbar spine to a greater extent than alendronate alone at all time points. It is however noted that increase 
Assessment report

Page 97/263 
  
  
 
in BMD in the romosozumab group was largest during the first 6 months of treatment, again indicating a 
more pronounced effect of romosozumab in the beginning of the treatment. There was also a tendency to 
decreased BMD at month 24 compared to month 12 in the romosozumab group.  The effects of romosozumab 
on lumbar spine strength as measured by FEA were consistent with the effects BMD as measured by QCT. 
Bone Biopsy Substudy 
The Bone biopsy substudy in 20070337 included 139 subjects and 154 biopsies.  
Number of subjects: 16 romosozumab vs 18 placebo at month 2, 40 romosozumab vs 33 placebo at month 
12 and 24 romosozumab/denosumab vs 23 placebo/denosumab at month 24. 
Bone Histomorphometry Evaluation 
Month 2 Cohort 
15 subjects in the romosozumab vs 14 subjects in the placebo arm with quadruple fluorochrome labelling 
(double fluorochrome labelling at baseline and before month 2) were evaluated for histomorphometry at 
month 2. This allowed for comparison between baseline and month 2 within a single biopsy (within-subject 
comparison). In the cancellous and endocortical compartments, within-subject comparisons showed 
significant increases in single-label, double-label, and mineralizing surfaces and surface-based bone 
formation rates (BFR/BS) only in the romosozumab group. In the intracortical compartment, double-label 
surface also only significantly increased in the romosozumab group. In contrast, the MAR (mineral apposition 
rate) increased in the placebo group between baseline and month 2 but did not change significantly in the 
romosozumab group during that time period. These data suggest that romosozumab increased the surface 
extent of active bone formation (dL/BS) but not the rate at the level of the individual osteoblast (MAR). In 
periosteal compartment, no significant changes in histomorphometry parameters were noted in either group 
at month 2 (due to few double-labels and a reduced number of data points for MAR and BFR/BS). 
Between-treatment comparisons of percent change from baseline to month 2 were consistent with the within-
subject comparisons. Compared with placebo, romosozumab significantly increased single-label, double-label, 
and mineralizing surfaces and the BFR/BS in the cancellous compartment, double-label and mineralizing 
surfaces and the BFR/BS in the endocortical compartment, and double-label and mineralizing surfaces in the 
intracortical compartment. At month 2 in the cancellous compartment, the median percent change in 
mineralizing surface in the romosozumab group was 325.1% compared with 67.3% in placebo group. Similar 
changes were observed in BFR/BS at month 2 (median percent change of approximately 328% in daily and 
annual rates in the romosozumab group; median percent change of approximately 80% in daily and annual 
rates in the placebo group). 
At month 2, bone structure parameters in the cancellous compartment (cancellous bone volume to tissue 
volume, trabecular thickness, trabecular number, and trabecular separation) did not differ significantly 
between the romosozumab and placebo groups. 
Romosozumab significantly increased osteoid thickness and osteoid volume compared with placebo (static 
bone formation parameters). 
A reduction in bone resorption was also evident at month 2, as indicated by significantly lower median eroded 
surface in the cancellous (romosozumab, 1.81%; placebo, 3.37%) and endocortical compartments 
(romosozumab, 1.58%; placebo, 6.27%) and a significantly lower median osteoclast surface in the cancellous 
compartment (romosozumab, 0%; placebo, 0.095%) in the romosozumab group.

Month 12 Cohort 
Cancellous bone volume to tissue volume, trabecular thickness, wall thickness, and cortical thickness 
increased significantly in the romosozumab group compared with the placebo group at month 12. 
However, dynamic and static bone formation parameters at month 12 demonstrated a decrease in bone 
formation secondary to the decrease in the rate of bone remodelling in the cancellous compartment, 
consistent with self-regulation of bone formation. All these parameters were significantly lower in the 
romosozumab arm, and mineralization lag time and formation period were significantly greater in the 
romosozumab group compared with the placebo group. These results are also supported by findings from 
bone formation marker, where elevated values are only detected during early romosozumab treatment 
phase. While on the one hand one could raise the concern that bone formation could in the worst case be 
inhibited for a longer time period (evaluation of histomorphometry parameters at month 24 did not reveal 
any significant differences between the romosozumab/denosumab and placebo/denosumab groups), it is 
however noted that bone formation markers increase again after 1 year in study 20060326.   
In the intracortical and endocortical compartments, no significant changes were noted in the single-label 
surface, double-label surface, mineralizing surface, and surface-based bone formation rate in the 
romosozumab group compared with the placebo group at month 12. Eroded surface and osteoclast surface 
were significantly lower in the romosozumab group than in the placebo group, indicating sustained inhibition 
of bone resorption. 
As no statistically significant difference to placebo was noted for bone formation parameters in the 
intracortical compartment (at month 2), concern was raised that this finding could be related to the fact that 
the most frequently reported type of non-vertebral fracture was forearm fractures. However, the Company 
clarified that changes to the cortical bone compartment result not only from effects at the intracortical but 
also at the periosteal and endosteal bone surfaces, and drug effects at any of those cortical surfaces can 
result in changes to cortical mass or structure. As described above, a positive effect on bone formation is 
observed in the endocortical surface at 2 months. This is supported by the finding that cortical thickness in 
biopsies of romosozumab treated patients was significantly thicker compared to placebo after 12 months. 
Bone Biopsy Micro-CT Analysis 
Micro-CT analyses were performed using bone biopsies from 71 subjects (39 romosozumab, 32 placebo) at 
month 12 and 38 subjects (18 romosozumab/denosumab, 20 placebo/denosumab) at month 24. 
Romosozumab treatment for 12 months resulted in significant increases in trabecular BMD and trabecular 
bone volume, primarily due to increased trabecular thickness. Furthermore, a significantly lower trabecular 
bone pattern factor and trabecular bone surface to bone volume compared with the placebo group at month 
12 was shown. The Company’s argumentation that this indicates better connectivity and that there seem to 
be more concave surfaces is endorsed. Regardless of the methodology used (histomorphometry or micro-CT), 
there is no difference in trabecular number between placebo and romosozumab at month 12. 
The Company did not discuss the clinical relevance of the findings. Therefore, such a discussion was 
requested with the Day 120 LoQ. Having considered the Applicant’s response, it has to be commented that a 
more detailed overview on the different parameters evaluated with the aim to assess the quality of bone 
microstructure, e.g. trabecular number thickness, trabecular connectivity, cortical thickness s, etc. (not 
limited to these ones), including a discussion on the clinical meaning of the reported values for indeed 
achieving an improved strength, would have been expected. On the other hand, it is agreed that bone 
histomorphometry data are exploratory in nature and primarily used for safety reasons due to certain 
Assessment report

Page 99/263 
  
  
limitations for example the fact that the samples represent a small fraction of the skeleton and may not be 
representative of other sites. Furthermore, the number of patients from who biopsies have been taken is 
small. Consequently, it is hard to draw any firm conclusions from the biopsies. It is also agreed that the 
presented parameters overall indicate an increased bone formation during the first weeks and a maintained 
decrease in bone resorption also during the late treatment phase, i.e. at month 12. It is therefore not 
considered reasonable to further pursue this issue and to ask for a more detailed discussion. It is also of 
interest that bone histomorphometry samples are taken at a non-weight bearing site, which may be a 
potential explanation to the fact that the effect of romosozumab in bone formation parameters is not as large 
at such sites as in e.g. vertebral bones. 
Study 20110174 in male osteoporosis  
The phase 3 male osteoporosis bridging trial set included studies 20070337 and 20110174. The primary goal 
of the analyses utilizing this trial set was to allow for side-by-side comparison of the two studies with respect 
to BMD and BTMs to assess the consistency of efficacy results between these 2 pivotal studies. The 
comparisons of efficacy results were based on data from the first 12 months of each study.  
Methodology and results are discussed below. 
Methods 
Study design 
20110174 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in men with osteoporosis.

time of screening, based on DXA scans 
2.  History of hip fracture 
3.  Use of anabolic steroid. Testosterone permitted provided not begun within 56 months prior to 
randomisation.  
Additional exclusion criteria are generally the same as for study 20070337 with exception for exclusion 
criteria related to denosumab treatment and criteria not applicable for male subjects.  
Treatments 
The romosozumab dose 210 mg QM was based on the results from the phase 2 dose-ranging studies 
20060326 and 20101291 in combination with PK/PD-data. No male subjects were included in these studies. 
However, there are no significant effects by gender according to the population PK analysis (section 3.3.1). 
As for the studies on postmenopausal women, protocol required supplementation with calcium/vitamin D as 
concomitant medication. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint 
• 
The primary efficacy endpoint was percent change from baseline in DXA BMD at the lumbar spine at 
month 12. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
• 
• 
The key secondary endpoints were percent change from baseline in DXA BMD at the femoral neck and 
total hip at month 12. 
Other secondary endpoints were percent change from baseline in DXA BMD at the lumbar spine, femoral 
neck, and total hip at month 6. 
Exploratory Efficacy Endpoints 
• 
• 
Percent changes from baseline in the BTMs CTX and P1NP at months 1, 3, 6, and 12. 
Analysis of bone histology and histomorphometry parameters at month 12 (in a subset of subjects) 
In study 20110174, the percent change in lumbar spine BMD after 12 months of treatment is the 
primary endpoint as advised in the EMA guidelines on osteoporosis for bridging studies. BMD changes in 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 101/263 
  
  
total hip and femoral neck are secondary endpoints and change in bone formation markers is included in 
the exploratory endpoints. However, effect on responder rates was not an endpoint.  
For the two pivotal studies in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, the proportion of subjects with 
any romosozumab induced increase of lumbar spine BMD from baseline as well as the proportion of 
subjects with such an increase of ≥10% were provided. The Applicant was asked to provide the 
corresponding numbers for the participants in 20110174. As in women, the responder rates were to 
include analyses based on all randomised subjects using a non-responder imputation in case data was 
missing. As requested, responder analyses have been provided, see below (Outcomes and estimations). 
Sample size 
A sample size of 225 subjects, 150 in the romosozumab arm and 75 subjects in the placebo arm was 
expected to provide > 99% power to show a difference between romosozumab and placebo in the primary 
and key secondary BMD endpoints. A high power at the planning stage is no issue, it is rather endorsed that 
the sample size was not smaller given the 2:1 allocation ratio and the importance to have a sufficient number 
of subjects in the control arm given also the assessment of e.g. safety. 
Randomisation 
Eligible subjects were randomised via IVRS to receive either romosozumab or placebo using a 2:1 allocation 
ratio. Randomisation was stratified by geographic region and it was expected that a minimum of 15 subjects 
was to be randomised from Japan.  
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. Subjects received either romosozumab or matching placebo. 
Statistical methods 
Although differences between 20070337, 20110142 and 20110174 regarding e.g. primary endpoints the 
analysis approach as used in 20070337 and 20110142 for the analyses of BMD endpoints was used also 
here; i.e. an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation. 
The sensitivity analyses planned comprised the primary analysis repeated based on the PP set and, at least 
for key secondary BMD endpoints, analyses were to be performed using a repeated measures model. The 
primary approach is not fully endorsed, and the sensitivity analysis based on a repeated measures model is 
not considered conservative in that it addresses the treatment effect if all patients would have been fully 
adherent. Having acknowledged the limited number of subjects who discontinued the study prior to month 
12, no further analyses will however be requested. 
 The data cutoff date for the 12-month primary analysis was 27 January 2016. The SAP was amended once 
and after the primary analysis cutoff date. The changes made were accounted for and was generally 
endorsed. As for 20070337 and 20110142, the date for database lock and the breaking of randomisation 
codes had however not been found. The Applicant clarified the missing date that showed that (initial) 
unblinding in study 20110174 was conducted after approval of the (final) SAP. Further, the Applicant stated 
that the primary analysis snapshot reflected a complete and accurate copy of the clinical study database at 
the date of snapshot. Final SAP approval was 3 March 2016; the date for the primary analysis snapshot and 
approval to unblind was 11 March 2016. The final database lock occurred 6 June 2016.The primary analysis 
was performed after all subjects had had the opportunity to complete the month 12 visit. No interim analyses 
or sample size re-estimation were planned for this study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 102/263 
  
  
The final analysis was to be performed after all subjects had had the opportunity to complete the month 15 
visit. The primary objective of the final analysis was safety and the 3-month follow-up period was to provide 
the opportunity to monitor all subjects for adverse events and formation of anti-romosozumab antibodies. 
The primary efficacy analysis subset included all randomised subjects who had a baseline DXA BMD 
measurement and at least 1 post-baseline DXA BMD measurement for each of the skeletal sites (lumbar 
spine, femoral neck, and total hip).  
The primary endpoint, percent change from baseline in DXA BMD at the lumbar spine at month 12, was 
analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with last observation carried forward (LOCF) 
imputation. The ANCOVA model included treatment, baseline DXA BMD value, baseline testosterone level, 
and the stratification factor of geographic region as main effects. Additional covariates of machine type 
(Hologic or Lunar) and machine type-by-baseline DXA BMD value interaction were also included in the model. 
A sensitivity analysis using the per protocol analysis subset was planned and has been performed.  
To control multiplicity for assessment of the primary, key secondary endpoints, and other secondary 
endpoints, a combination of a hierarchical and simultaneous testing procedure was implemented. The 
hierarchical testing procedure had three steps: 
1. Lumbar spine BMD percent change from baseline at 12 months 
2. Total hip and femoral neck BMD percent change from baseline at 12 months 
3. Lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck BMD percent change from baseline at 6 months 
The statistical inferences of the treatment effects in the second step was to be made only if the treatment 
effect on the primary efficacy endpoint was statistically significant using a 2-sided type 1 error rate of 0.05. 
The Hochberg procedure was employed to control the overall type 1 error for the second step in order to 
maintain the overall significance level at 0.05. The statistical inferences of the treatment effects in the third 
step, added in SAP version 2.0 (dated 03 March 2016), was to be made only when the treatment effects on 
both key secondary endpoints (in step 2) were statistically significant. The Hochberg procedure was 
employed to control the overall type 1 error also in the third step in order to maintain the overall significance 
level at 0.05.

Subjects in study 20110174 were approximately 1.5 years older than the subjects in 20070337. 66% of the 
subjects in the study came from Europe compared to 42% in study 20070337.

Table 29: 10 Year Probability of Fracture: Study 20070337 (Women) and Study 20110174 (Men) 
(Randomized Subjects) 
Consistent with the differences in eligibility criteria, mean baseline BMD T-scores were higher in 20110174 
than in 20070337 at all anatomical sites for both treatment groups. The percentage of subjects with a history 
of fractures was higher in 20110174. 
Baseline 10-year fracture risk was lower in 20110174, but the distribution of individual subjects’ 10-year 
probability of major osteoporotic fracture risk shows a considerable overlap with the distribution for 
20070337.

Outcomes and estimation 
Effect on bone mineral density (primary and secondary endpoints) 
Table 30: Bone Mineral Density Percent Change From Baseline at Month 12: Study 20070337 
(Women) and Study 20110174 (Men) (Primary Analysis Set for BMD, LOCF) 
The primary endpoint was met, as romosozumab increased lumbar spine BMD through month 12 compared 
to placebo. All p-values on tests of treatment-by-subgroup interactions were > 0.05 with the exception of 
baseline lumbar spine BMD T-score category (p = 0.0029). No qualitative interaction was detected. 
Romosozumab increased total hip and femoral neck BMD compared to placebo through month 12; however, 
the percent changes from baseline BMD in the romosozumab group were more modest in both total hip and 
femoral neck, resulting in a lower LS mean difference between romosozumab and placebo in 20110174 than 
in 20070337. The Applicant speculates that this may, in part, be due to the lower baseline BMD in 20070337. 
This can be supported by results of BMD T-score subgroups in the male osteoporosis study mentioned above. 
It is noted that the distribution of baseline lumbar spine BMD T-score and 10-year major osteoporotic 
fracture risk between Studies 20110174 and 20070337 have considerable overlap. 
The magnitude of absolute BMD change from baseline was comparable between the romosozumab treatment 
arms of study 20110174 and the reference study 20070337 in lumbar spine, whereas the absolute BMD 
change to baseline in total hip and femoral neck were lower in male osteoporosis patients. 
To be included in the analysis, subjects were required to have a baseline and at least one post-baseline 
assessment. Few subjects discontinued the study early i.e. prior to month 12; 11/163 (6.7%) in the 
romosozumab arm and 3/82 (3.7%) in the placebo group. Although more subjects in the romosozumab than

placebo arm, the proportion excluded from the primary analyses was identical in the two groups (3.7%). This 
implies that an “early” assessment, from month 6 or from the time-point of early discontinuation was carried 
forward for more subjects in the romosozumab arm than in the placebo arm. Although the use of LOCF can 
be questioned and the sensitivity analyses performed based on a repeated measure model is not considered 
very useful, the differences between the treatments are considered convincing. 
As requested, the Applicant provided BMD responder analyses (for all three pivotal studies) based on all 
randomised subjects using non-responder imputation in case of missing data. The percentages of subjects 
with improved BMD (any increase from baseline) were higher in the romosozumab group than placebo group 
at all anatomical sites after 12 months of treatment. Below are excerpts from responses provided during the 
procedure. In the analyses in which a subject was to be classified as a responder only in case of ≥10% 
improvement from baseline, a statistically significant difference was shown for lumbar spine but not total hip 
or femoral neck. For lumbar spine the responder rate was 1.2% (1/82) in the placebo arm and 60.1% 
(98/163) in the romosozumab arm (p<0.001). For total hip and femoral neck respectively, there were no 
responders in the placebo group and in the romosozumab arm only 2/163 (1.2%) and 3/163 (1.8%), 
respectively.

Fractures 
In this study, fractures were reported as adverse events. In total, 6 fractures were reported as treatment 
emergent adverse events; 3 in the placebo group (N=81; 3.7%) (femur, humerus and upper limb) and 3 in 
the romosozumab group (N=163; 1.8%) (lumbar vertebra, rib, thoracic vertebra). No additional fracture was 
reported during the 3-month follow-up period in either group. The absolute number of fracture events in the 
study is far too small to draw any firm conclusions.  
Ancillary analyses 
Bone Biopsy Substudy 
A total of 20 transiliac crest bone biopsy specimens were obtained from men with osteoporosis at 12 months 
(11  specimens  in  romosozumab  group,  9  specimens  in  placebo  group).  Of  the  biopsies  obtained,  all  were 
adequate  for  qualitative  histology.  All  biopsies  from  placebo  patients  and  9  (81.8%)  of  biopsies  from 
romosozumab patients were adequate for full quantitative histomorphometry assessment. Qualitative histology 
assessments showed normal lamellar bone with no evidence of mineralization defects, woven bone, marrow 
fibrosis,  or  clinically  significant  marrow  abnormality  in  patients  treated  with  romosozumab.  The  presence  of 
double-labelled  surface,  as  evidence  of  active  bone  formation,  was  observed  in  the  trabecular  or  cortical 
compartments for 88.9% (8/9) of patients in the romosozumab group and 77.8% (7/9) patients in the placebo 
group.  In  cancellous  bone,  histomorphometric  analyses  at  month  12  revealed  decreases  in  bone  resorption 
parameters (percent eroded and osteoclastic surfaces) in the romosozumab group with no significant difference 
noted in bone formation and bone structure parameters compared with the placebo group.

Table 35: Summary of subjects by age group for all clinical studies 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-analysis) 
With the submitted dossier, an integrated summary of efficacy was provided. The objective of the analyses 
for this integrated summary of efficacy was to support the efficacy assessment of romosozumab in the 
treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and men with osteoporosis. This integrated statistical 
analysis plan (SAP) covers the efficacy assessment of romosozumab through the initial 12-month treatment 
period. In this integrated SAP, the objectives were: 
• to assess the consistency of efficacy results during the initial 12-month treatment period across the two 
PMO pivotal studies (20070337 and 20110142), with respect to the fracture endpoints as well as bone 
mineral density (BMD) and bone turnover markers (BTMs) 
• to summarize and compare efficacy of romosozumab 210 mg SC QM against placebo at month 6 and 12 
(when available) and assess consistency of efficacy results in the three PMO supportive studies (20060326, 
20101291 and 20120156), as measured by BMD and BTM endpoints

• to provide a dose-response efficacy profile of romosozumab doses compared with placebo in Studies 
20060326 and 20101291 as measured by BMD and BTM endpoints, to support the dose regimen used in 
phase 3 studies 
• to assess the consistency of efficacy results during the initial 12-month treatment period across the two 
pivotal studies (20070337 and 20110174), 
In order to illustrate consistency of observed treatment effect in fracture data and BMD, several trial sets 
were defined to juxtapose important efficacy outcome data: 
Phase 3 fracture trial set 
The phase 3 fracture trial set included the Studies 20070337 and 20110142. The primary goal of the 
analyses utilizing this trial set was to allow for side-by-side comparison of PMO pivotal Studies 20070337 and 
20110142 with respect to clinical endpoints of fractures, bone mineral density (BMD) and bone turnover 
markers (BTMs), to allow for assessment of consistency of efficacy results between the two pivotal studies. 
Placebo-controlled trial set 
The placebo-controlled trial set included placebo-controlled PMO Studies 20060326, 20101291 and 
20120156. The objective of the analyses utilizing this trial set was to summarize and compare the efficacy of 
romosozumab 210 mg subcutaneously (SC) once monthly (QM) against placebo, as measured by BMD and 
BTM endpoints at 6 months and 12 months (when available) after study baseline. 
Dose-ranging trial set 
The dose-ranging trial set included the two multi-dose Studies 20060326 and 20101291. The objective of the 
analyses utilizing this trial set was to provide a dose-response efficacy profile of romosozumab doses 
compared with placebo as measured by BMD and BTM endpoints. 
Phase 3 male osteoporosis bridging trial set 
The phase 3 male osteoporosis bridging trial set included the Studies 20070337 and 20110174. The primary 
goal of the analyses utilizing this trial set was to allow for side-by-side comparison of pivotal Studies 
20070337 and 20110174 with respect to bone mineral density (BMD) and bone turnover markers (BTMs), to 
assess the consistency of efficacy results between these two pivotal studies. The objective of this trial set is 
to support an indication for treatment of osteoporosis in men by bridging the efficacy of romosozumab in men 
with osteoporosis from Study 20110174 with results from the pivotal placebo-controlled registration Study 
20070337 in women with osteoporosis. 
No new hypotheses were to be tested for the phase 3 fracture trial set or the phase 3 male osteoporosis 
bridging trial set. The analysis of each study’s endpoints was performed using the same approaches as 
specified in section 10 from each individual study SAP. 
The hypothesis of the placebo-controlled trial set was that romosozumab 210 mg QM demonstrated superior 
efficacy compared with placebo, as measured by BMD and BTM endpoints.  
The hypothesis of the dose-ranging trial set was that there was an increasing dose response in efficacy of 
romosozumab, as measured by BMD and BTM endpoints. 
The conduct of integrated efficacy evaluation is generally acknowledged, the additional benefit for 
assessment is however limited. Efficacy data from the phase 3 fracture studies are presented side-by-side 
Assessment report

Page 120/263 
  
  
and not integrated with each other due to the differences in the control group (placebo vs active control). The 
fracture studies are also not integrated with the supportive phase 2 and 3 studies. 
For some parts of the assessment (e.g. comparison of FRAX-risk profiles of male/female study populations, 
region difference in baseline fracture risk), some of the tables produced were considered informative. In 
these cases, corresponding information/tables were taken from the integrated analyses report.   
Supportive study 20120156 
This study evaluated the non-inferiority of a 6-month treatment with romosozumab 210 mg administered 
every month (QM) using a 90 mg/mL concentration compared to a 70 mg/mL concentration. The study was 
conducted at 11 centres: 7 in Poland, 2 in the Czech Republic and 2 in the United States. 
The primary endpoint was percent change from baseline in DXA BMD at the lumbar spine. 
Table 36:  Lumbar Spine Bone Mineral Density Percent Change from Baseline at Month 6 (ANCOVA 
Model) (Primary Efficacy Analysis Set, Observed Data) (20120156 Month 6 Analysis) 
The mean treatment difference between romosozumab 90 mg/mL and romosozumab 70 mg/mL was -0.4%. 
Because the lower bound of the 1-sided 97.5% CI of the mean difference between the 2 romosozumab 
groups was -1.5%, which was greater than the pre-specified limit of -2.0%, the data supported the claim of 
non-inferiority. Together with the results from study 20120277 the equivalence of both treatment 
concentrations was confirmed. However, the applicant was encouraged to treat for full 12 months, due to the 
labelling duration of 12 months. This was based on the argument that the first 6 months of treatment 
account for ~70% of the treatment effect normally observed in 12 months. In general, the claim to show 
non-inferiority of 70mg/ml and 90mg/ml treatment was successfully demonstrated. 
All fractures were reported as treatment-emergent adverse events. In the two placebo groups (N=52), 3 
fractures (radius, humerus, patella) were reported. 2 fractures (radius, forearm) were reported in the 
romosozumab 70 mg/ml group (N=119) and 4 fractures (radius, foot, hand and spinal fracture) were 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 121/263 
  
  
 
reported in the romosozumab 90 mg/ml group (N=123). The absolute number of events in each treatment 
group was too low to allow any firm conclusions.  
Supportive study 20080289 
This was a randomized, open-label, teriparatide (TPTD)-controlled study in postmenopausal women with 
osteoporosis at high risk for fracture after transition from < 3 years of treatment oral bisphosphonates.  
It is agreed that it is of value to understand and document the effects of romosozumab in comparison to 
TPTD in women who have already been treated with antiresorptive agents such as bisphosphonates. A 
blinded treatment would have been strongly preferred. 
Subjects were aged ≥ 55 to ≤ 90 years at randomization (mean age 71.5 years) and must have been taking 
an oral bisphosphonate at a dose approved for PMO, for a minimum of 3 years prior to screening, with the 
last year (of the previous 3 years prior to screening) treated with alendronate (70 mg weekly or equivalent). 
The population is described as a “bisphosphonate pre-treated patient population”. However, most of the 
patients were pre-treated with alendronate for 3 years prior to screening (92.7% and 88.1% for teriparatide 
and romosozumab, respectively). Literature indicates that anabolic responsiveness to teriparatide differs 
based on prior antiresorptive therapy, and that the use of alendronate may blunt the magnitude of the effect 
(Ettinger et al 2004, Finkelstein et al 2006, Black et al 2003, Gasser et al 2000, Graeff et al 2007). 
Therefore, generalizability of the results of study 20080289 to all bisphosphonate pre-treated patients cannot 
indisputably be concluded. 
The primary endpoint was the percent change from baseline in DXA BMD at the total hip through month 12.

Romosozumab increased total hip BMD compared to 20 µg QD TPTD through 12 months of treatment, 
indicating that previous treatment with bisphosphonates does not attenuate the romosozumab effect bone 
mineral density. There was no difference from baseline in total hip BMD with 12 months of TPTD treatment. 
As opposed to this, in study 20060326, 20 µg TPTD increased total hip BMD compared to placebo (1.3% 
vs -0.7; p<0.0001). The TPTD effect was comparable to the effect of romosozumab 70 mg QM and 140 mg 
Q3M, but lower than 140 mg QM and 210 mg QM. The main difference between the two studies was that in 
study 20060326, the use of bisphosphonates within a pre-specified time limit was an exclusion criterion.  
Furthermore, romosozumab increased DXA BMD at 12 months in lumbar spine, femoral neck and total hip 
(p<0.0001 in all locations) and estimated strength by FEA at total hip (p<0.0001).  
Concluding, it is agreed that romosozumab was superior in increasing BMD in postmenopausal women pre-
treated with bisphosphonates (mainly alendronate) compared to teriparatide, during the first year of 
treatment following transition. The appropriateness to generalize results from alendronate to bisphosphonate 
pre-treatment is however questioned. 
In this study, fractures were reported as adverse events. In the TPTD group, 8 fractures were reported and in 
the romosozumab group, there were 7 fractures reported. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The romosozumab clinical phase 2 and 3 programme consisted of three pivotal and four supportive studies. 
Two of the pivotal studies, 20070337 and 20110142, evaluated the effect of romosozumab in 
postmenopausal women, whereas the third, 20110174, was a bridging study to men with osteoporosis.  
The scope of study 20060326 was to find a dose level for future studies, to evaluate the effect of transition 
from romosozumab to antiresorptive medication and to evaluate romosozumab retreatment. Study 20101291 
was a dose finding study exclusively in Japanese women. Study 20120156 compared two concentrations of 
romosozumab; 70 mg/mL and 90 mg/m. In study 20080289, romosozumab was compared to teriparatide 
after transition from ≥3 years of recent per oral bisphosphonate treatment.

Adherence to Scientific Advice 
The applicant received scientific advice (SA) from the CHMP. Overall, the applicant did adhere to the CHMP 
scientific advices (see also section 1.1) as well as to the CHMP guideline on osteoporosis, specifically with 
regard to the clinical development programme, as summarised below: 
Guideline on the evaluation of medical products in the treatment of primary osteoporosis 2006 
(CHMP/EWP/552/95) 
The primary variable should be based on the occurrence of new axial and peripheral fractures. 
EMA Scientific Advice EMA/CHMP/SAWP/868033/2011 17 November 2011 
Regarding Study 20070337, it was agreed that study endpoints are aligned to EU CHMP osteoporosis 
guideline. Regarding the active-controlled Study 20110142, CHMP concurred with the proposed patient 
population, and with alendronate as a comparator.   
CHMP suggested conducting a study with a total duration of 3 years (in-line with the EU guideline 
requirements) in which 1 year of romosozumab treatment is followed by antiresorptive treatment (e.g. 
alendronate) for an additional 2 years. Assessment of primary efficacy after 12 months could be acceptable in 
order to determine the initial efficacy with continuation of the trial to further explore safety and confirm 
maintenance of effect after switching to the subsequent antiresorptive treatment. 
EMA Follow-up Scientific Advice EMA/CHMP/SAWP/352926/2013 27 June 2013 
CHMP concurred with the proposed multiple-dose study to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the 90 mg/mL 
PFS presentation compared with the 70 mg/mL glass PFS.  
EMA Follow-up Scientific Advice EMA/CHMP/SAWP/22643/2017 26 Jan 2017 
CHMP advised that an application for romosozumab may be initiated once 2-year follow-up data become 
available for Study 20110142, with 3-year data submitted during the licensing procedure.  Further follow-up 
(3 to 5 years, as specified in guidelines) may be a post-licensing commitment, particularly if there are any 
signals of loss of efficacy or safety signals at the time of the MAA. 
Dosing regimen 
In study 20060326 and 20101291, there was a dose-dependent increase in lumbar spine bone mineral 
density (BMD) with romosozumab treatment (70 mg, 140 mg, 210 mg QM) through month 12 compared to 
placebo. In 20060326, romosozumab 140 mg and 210 mg given Q3M also increased lumbar spine BMD 
compared to placebo, but to a lower extent than the QM dosing. 
The romosozumab treatment duration in the initial phase 2 study 20060326 was 24 months. Lumbar spine 
BMD continued to increase during the entire treatment period; however, the increase was largest during the 
first 6 months of treatment. This correlates with the transient increase in bone formation markers. However, 
the decrease in bone resorption markers was partly sustained through 12 months. Bone turnover markers 
(BTM) are further discussed in section3.3.2 (Pharmacodynamics).  
Based on PK/PD data and the BTM and BDM data from study 20060326 and 20101291, the posology in the 
pivotal studies, as well as the proposed dosing regimen, was 210 mg SC QM for 12 months. This is endorsed.

The dose-response analysis (report 119384B) displays a clear dose-response relationship. However, several 
of the detected covariates are expected to be highly correlated and hence the covariate relationships should 
be interpreted with caution. The covariate relationships detected in the population PK analysis are considered 
more informative and an updated dose-response model is not expected to change the dosing 
recommendation. 
In study 20101291, Japanese patients showed a differing response in both lumbar spine and total hip and 
even opposing effects were presented. These effects were explained by the applicant as confounded by study. 
However, this does not represent an acceptable explanation especially as also the PPK analysis including data 
for Japanese subjects from different studies showed a significant effect for Japanese patients. The applicant 
was asked to further address the differences seen for Japanese and was asked to provide an explanation for 
the opposite effects on lumbar spine and total hip. The Applicant provided a discussion concerning the 
claimed confounding by study effect for Japanese patients and further data to illustrate the differing effects 
seen for Japanese patients. The conclusion that the data was confounded by study was based on higher 
placebo response in study 20101291 including only Japanese patients resulting in lower response compared 
to placebo. The discussion provided by the Applicant can be followed and the conclusions are acceptable. The 
Applicant provided an overview of percent BMD change (for all three studies) and the absolute change for 
study 20070337 including the overall population and Japanese patients. The different trends for lumbar spine 
and total hip can be observed in percent BMD change (e.g. study 20070337: lumbar spine: Overall: 12.7% 
and Japanese 14.9%; total hip: Overall: 5.8% and Japanese: 4.8%). However, the effect is very small 
considering absolute BMD change (lumbar spine: Overall: 0.0992 and Japanese 0.102; total hip: Overall: 
0.0385 and Japanese: 0.029). The Applicant provided literature references stating that this effect in Japanese 
patients has also been observed with other treatments for osteoporosis (denosumab, teriparatide). It is 
agreed that these changes are small and probably not clinically relevant. The overall discussion is acceptable. 
In study 20120156, treatment effect between 210 mg romosozumab SC given QM as 3 x 1 ml of a 70 mg/ml 
solution and as 2x 2.17 ml of a 90 mg/mL solution was studied. The mean treatment difference between the 
romosozumab 90 mg/mL and romosozumab 70 mg/mL was -0.4%. Because the lower bound of the 1-sided 
97.5% CI of the mean difference between the 2 romosozumab groups was -1.5%, which was greater than 
the pre-specified limit of -2.0%, the data supported the claim of non-inferiority. The mean differences from 
placebo were 8.8% and 8.4% for the romosozumab 70 mg/mL and romosozumab 90 mg/mL groups, 
respectively, which were both statistically significant (p < 0.0001). The claim to show non-inferiority of 
70mg/ml and 90mg/ml treatment was successfully demonstrated. 
Studies 20070337 and 20110142 – postmenopausal women with osteoporosis 
Study 20070337 comprised of a 12-month double-blind, placebo-controlled study period and a 24-month 
open label denosumab follow-up period. 20110142 comprised of a 12–month double-blind, alendronate-
controlled study period, followed by open label alendronate.  
Study 20110142 was event-driven. The primary analysis was performed after a mean follow-up period of 
approximately 32 months. 
The difference in the eligibility criteria regarding BMD T-score limits and fracture history between the two 
studies allowed inclusion of subjects with more severe osteoporosis in 20110142. The two studies are 
therefore not completely comparable. 
Subjects with renal insufficiency were not explicitly excluded from the studies, but only 18 subjects in 
20070337 and 11 in 20110142 had baseline eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2 (all in the range 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 125/263 
  
  
15-<30 ml/min/1.73 m2). The number of subjects with eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2 is considered too low to 
enable dose recommendations in this subpopulation. 
Regarding planned analyses, the statistical analysis plans for study 20070337 and study 20110142 shared a 
number of features. The analyses performed were overall acceptable. The approach to missing data and 
missing data imputation however deserved clarifications and additional analyses were requested.  
For analyses of the incidence of new vertebral fracture, a logistic regression model using last-observation-
carried-forward was used. For both study 20070337 and study 20110142, the Applicant was requested to 
summarize the number and percentage of missing lateral spine x-ray assessments at each visit by study arm 
and to clarify in how many cases LOCF was used. The Applicant has clarified that LOCF imputation was only 
used at the vertebra level and not for completely missing x-rays. A summary of evaluable x-rays by nominal 
visit and treatment group (separately for each study) was presented. In study 20070337, the percentages of 
only partially available x-ray results per visit were all below 10%, in study 20110142 the percentages of only 
partially available x-ray results per visit were 11.6% for Month 12 and below 7% for Month 24. Irrespective 
of study, they were comparable between both treatment groups at all time-points. For other fracture 
endpoints time-to-event analyses were performed for which e.g. the analysis of clinical fracture it was stated 
that missing values were imputed by the use of the last non-missing observation; how LOCF was used in 
time-to-event analyses and further, how censoring was applied in case of missing assessments needed 
clarifications. In their response, the Applicant acknowledged that the term last observation carried forward 
(LOCF) in the context of Cox regression analyses was misleading and confirmed that established definitions 
for censoring and first occurrence of event were applied in time-to-event analyses; the censoring date for 
each study subject depended from her individual study duration and hence, that for patients dropping out 
earlier their actual study end date was taken into account in the analysis. For primary analyses of BMD 
endpoints, 10% to 20% of subjects were excluded depending on analysis time-point and in case of missing 
assessments, LOCF was used also here. Although reassuring that the proportion of subjects excluded were 
well balanced between randomised treatments irrespective of study, additional sensitivity analyses based on 
all randomised subjects were requested. In the sensitivity analyses now performed by the Applicant a 
control-based pattern multiple imputation approach for missing data was used. Although estimated treatment 
differences were smaller compared with the pre-planned initially presented analyses, they confirmed superior 
efficacy of the romosozumab arm versus the control arm in each of the studies (placebo in study 20070337 
and alendronate in study 20110142). Regarding LOCF its use can be criticised in that it is not clear what 
treatment effect is targeted; it is neither the effect that would be observed if all patients would be fully 
adherent to treatment, nor the effect that would be observed if loss of benefit from active treatment after 
treatment drop-out is taken into account. In the primary BMD analysis set, subjects with assessments 
completely missing were ignored leading to non-negligible proportions of randomised subjects being excluded 
in the analyses; depending on analysis/time-point this concerned 12% to 20% of randomised subjects. Since 
the information in section 5.1 of the SmPC should be statistically compelling, not only in terms of degree of 
evidence presented, the Applicant was requested to amend the tables concerned. Therefore, in section 5.1 of 
the SmPC which had been proposed by the applicant,the BMD results were revised and based on ANCOVA 
analyses conducted on all randomised subjects using a control-based pattern multiple imputation approach 
for missing data. 
The primary endpoint in study 20070337, the subject incidence of new vertebral fracture after romosozumab 
treatment compared with placebo, is aligned with CHMP guidance (CPMP/EWP/552/95 Rev. 2) and represents 
in principle the established measure of efficacy for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. The first 
component of the co-primary endpoint is considered suitable to analyse the efficacy of romosozumab in the 
time window of intended treatment duration, i.e. 0 - 12 months (induction of fracture-protective effect). 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 126/263 
  
  
However, the second component of the co-primary endpoint, the vertebral fracture incidence during the 
(first) 24-months study period is not considered adequate to directly assess the maintenance of fracture 
protection after romosozumab cessation. This is because fracture events observed during the first year of 
treatment are counted again in this data analysis, and any relevant treatment effect already identified in the 
first year might suffice to reveal a significant result also for the co-primary 24-months analysis, even if there 
was no fracture protective effect after month 12. Against this background, one important comparison of 
interest concerns (new vertebral) fracture incidence observed exclusively in the second year during open-
label denosumab treatment, i.e. setting a new baseline for the analysis at month 12 (cessation of 
romosozumab treatment). The Applicant provided the additional analyses as requested. Whilst the mentioned 
potential methodological deficiencies of this post-hoc analyses of the second-year fracture-incidences are 
acknowledged, the additional information provided however further supports the (general) assumption of 
persistence of the fracture-protective efficacy after cessation of romosozumab. Results provided indicate that 
the original co-primary efficacy analysis is not strongly dominated by month 12 outcome only. Similar to 
outcome for the Month 0-12 treatment period, the point estimate for the relative fracture risk reduction for 
the Month 12-24 study period (i.e. effect size) is smallest for the category of non-vertebral fractures.  
The focus chosen in study 20110142 to primarily investigate fracture protection advantages of a 
romosozumab-alendronate (ALN) treatment sequence over an ALN-alone treatment after a treatment period 
of 24 months is not considered optimal from the romosozumab-licensure perspective. Instead, just as 
queried in relation for study 20070337 above, it would have been found most suitable to focus the 
assessment of treatment initiation of a protective effect on fracture data from the active-controlled phase (up 
to 12 months). As regards investigation of maintenance of protective effect after cessation of romosozumab 
treatment under continued ALN treatment, it would have seemed more adequate to take month 12 status as 
new baseline for data analysis, also in study 20110142.  The Applicant provided the additional analyses 
separated by year- study time intervals as requested. It can be agreed with the Applicant, that the statistical 
evaluation of fracture data collected after the treatment switch to alendronate is supporting the hypothesis 
that extended fracture risk benefit can be achieved in the subsequent time period following romosozumab 
treatment cessation. However, such a finding should be differentiated from any benefit-claim directly 
associated with subsequent antiresorptive therapy, which is not a matter of primary assessment in this MAA. 
As for trial 20070337, estimated effect size in both periods (Month 0-12, Month 12-24) seems least 
pronounced in the category of non-vertebral fractures. Aside this non-optimality in definition of trial objective 
and primary endpoints, there is a high level of complexity coming from terminology and statistical analysis 
strategy, which aggravates reading and interpretation of the fracture data analyses. From a planning 
perspective, many conditions where set up to define when different analyses for different fracture endpoints 
were planned to be carried out, in varying analyses sets. Corresponding explanations are hard to follow, as 
throughout protocol, SAP and CSR the term “primary analysis” is used in a confusing manner, as it 
sometimes refers to the actual analysis of primary endpoints, but sometimes also just to the point in time 
when primary endpoints are evaluated (mentioned for the analyses of actual secondary endpoints). 
A total of 16,716 subjects were screened for study 20070337 and 7,180 were randomized to the 
romosozumab 210 mg (3,589 subjects) and placebo (3,591 subjects) arm. These two groups were well 
balanced regarding baseline demographics and BMD, as expected. The 10-year probability of a major 
osteoporotic fracture, according to the FRAX, were similar between treatment groups, whereas generally 
lower in the region Central/Latin America (accounting for 43% of study population), reflecting a population 
with a lower fracture risk. This was driven by a substantially lower incidence of previous fractures, and a 
moderately lower incidence of parental hip fracture, current smoking status, secondary osteoporosis, and 
alcohol use. According to the Applicant, a number of reports in the scientific literature have indicated that 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020

lower non-vertebral fracture risk and FRAX scores in women from the Central/Latin American region is not 
unusual when considering similar ages and T-scores of the population in other countries. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics in pivotal studies 
The number of randomised subjects in 20070337 was 7,180 subjects and in 20110142 4,093 subjects. The 
male pivotal study, 20110174, was much smaller with 245 randomised subjects. 
In all three studies, a substantial part (42-66%) of the subjects was included in Europe. The studies are 
considered relevant for the European population.  
The treatment groups were well balanced regarding age, ethnicity, race and BMI in each study. The main 
differences between the three studies in baseline demographics was mean age (20070337 70.9 years; 
20110142 74.3 years and 20110174 72.1 years) and smoking (46.1% never-smokers in 20110174 compared 
to 71.8% in 20070337 and 72.3% in 20110142).  
The difference in mean age is considered secondary to the differences in eligibility criteria between the 
studies. 
Due to eligibility criteria, mean baseline BMD T-scores at all locations were higher in 20110174 than in 
20070337. This is discussed further below.  
Fracture endpoints 
Study 20070337 met its co-primary endpoints which were subject incidence of new radiological vertebral 
fractures compared with placebo through the 12-month double-blind period (0.5% vs 1.8%) and through 
month 24 after both groups transitioned to denosumab (0.6% vs 2.5%); p<0.001 at both time points.  
Vertebral fracture risk reduction persisted over the 24-month study period for subjects initially randomized to 
romosozumab, as romosozumab for 12 months followed by denosumab for 12 months significantly reduced 
the risk of new vertebral fractures compared with placebo for 12 months followed by denosumab for 12 
months, with a relative risk reduction of 75% (95% CI: 60, 84) and absolute risk reduction of 1.89% 
(NNT=53).  
Romosozumab also reduced the risk of clinical fractures (clinical vertebral and non-vertebral) compared to 
placebo at 12 months (adjusted p=0.008), but not at 24 months after adjustment for multiplicity.  
Romosozumab numerically reduced the risk of non-vertebral fractures compared to placebo at 12 months and 
24 months, however, the reduction was not statistically significant after adjustment for multiplicity. 
In study 20110142, romosozumab treatment reduced subject incidence of new vertebral fractures compared 
to alendronate during the 12-month double-blind period (secondary endpoint) (3.2% vs 5.0%; p=0.008). 
Through 24 months, the incidence of new vertebral fractures with romosozumab/alendronate treatment 
compared to alendronate/alendronate (primary endpoint) (4.1% vs 8.0%; p<0.001). 
The primary analysis in study 20110142 was performed after median follow-up time of 2.7 years 
(approximately 33 months). Romosozumab reduced the risk of clinical fractures through primary analysis 
(primary endpoint) compared to alendronate (9.7% vs 13.0%; nominal p=0.027). 
Romosozumab/alendronate reduced the risk of non-vertebral fractures through primary analysis (not 
significant at 12 or 24 months) compared to alendronate alone (8.7% vs 10.6%); multiplicity adjusted 
p=0.040.

The incidence of fractures was higher in 20110142 than in 20070337. This was expected as the study 
population of 20110142 was older and had a more severe osteoporosis at baseline. The absolute numbers of 
fractures, especially non-vertebral fractures, were lower than estimated in 20070337 resulting in modest 
absolute risk reductions (1.3% at month 12, 1.9% at month 24). 
 Hip fractures are the most serious consequences of osteoporosis, associated with serious risks, permanent 
disability and also increased mortality. Differences in hip fractures between treatment groups were not 
statistically significant at any time points in any study. The low number of non-vertebral fracture events may 
impair the possibility to detect an effect of romosozumab subject incidence of such fractures. 
In the remaining efficacy/safety studies, fractures were reported as adverse events. According to the EMA 
“Guideline on the evaluation of medicinal products in the treatment of primary osteoporosis ( 
http://www.ema.europa.eu/docs/en_GB/document_library/Scientific_guideline/2009/09/WC500003405.pdf) 
separate fracture data are not required for bridging studies.  
The absolute number of fracture events in each study was too low for conclusions and the results were not 
consistent across studies. 
In study 20070337, a predefined by-region subgroup analysis for the non-vertebral fracture endpoint through 
month 12 showed that in Central/Latin America (accounting for 43.0% of the randomized population), a 
lower than expected non-vertebral fracture rate (compared to the assumed rate of 3.5% used for sample size 
calculation) was observed in the placebo group in the first 12 months (1.2%), with no reduction seen in the 
romosozumab group (1.5%). In the Central/Latin America region, the absolute number of fractures was even 
higher in the romosozumab group (placebo: 19/1534) vs. romosozumab: 24/1550), but the corresponding 
statistical test for a qualitative interaction obviously lacked power due to the low event numbers and the 
rather small treatment difference in absolute terms. The Applicant also describes a non-vertebral fracture 
rate of 1.1% in the placebo group in North America, which was also lower than (overall) expected, and the 
impact of the trend to have better fracture protection under placebo on overall results is low, as the sample 
size in this region represents only 2.7% of the overall study population. In a post-hoc subgroup analysis that 
excluded Central/Latin America data to derive a patient subset from all other regions combined (rest-of-
world), the non-vertebral fracture rate was 2.7% in the placebo group and 1.6% in the romosozumab group 
(RRR 42%, ARR 1.1%). As the baseline characteristics between treatment arms (placebo, romosozumab) are 
still balanced in the rest-of-world population after excluding the Central/Latin America region), this post-hoc 
analysis excluding Central/Latin America could be considered meaningful. 
When looking on the FRAX data of the Central/Latin America population, a generally lower 10-year probability 
of major osteoporotic fractures and of hip fractures can be observed. These marked region differences in 
baseline FRAX probabilities aggravate a straight forward interpretation of fracture analysis outcome, in 
particular for the analyses of non-vertebral and clinical fractures. There were even more fractures in the 
romosozumab arm compared to the placebo arm in the central/Latin American population.  
The Applicant has proposed a sequential treatment with romosozumab for 12 months followed by anti-
resorptive therapy. Romosozumab increased BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip and femoral neck at Month 
12 regardless of prior osteoporosis treatment in Study 20080289, 20110142, 20070337 and 20110174. A 
sequential approach is therefore accepted. 
The appropriate timing for introducing romosozumab after a fracture has been discussed. Especially, it was 
considered unclear to what extent patients in romosozumab studies had recent osteoporotic fractures and 
which impact romosozumab might have on fracture healing if administered as early treatment. This post-
fracture population is considered especially vulnerable for adverse events, and e.g. data for IV 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 129/263 
  
  
bisphosphonate treatment suggests better efficacy when treatment is initiated >6 weeks after hip surgery 
compared to early treatment start.  
To evaluate the timing of romosozumab initiation after a fracture, the gains in BMD in 67 subjects 
(20110142) and 29 subjects (20070337) following a non-vertebral fracture while on study were investigated.  
The mean time to next romosozumab dose was 23.0 days (median 14.0 days; range 0 to 197 days) in Study 
20110142 and 16.0 days (median 13.0; range 0 to 66 days) in Study 20070337.  
The mean percent change from baseline (95% CI) in lumbar spine BMD in 54 subjects with a non-vertebral 
fracture event through month 12 was 14.4 vs 13.7 in subjects without such a fracture event (n=1,572) in 
Study 2011042. The corresponding numbers for Study 20070337 were 13.5 (n=27) vs 12.9 (n=1,178). 
There was no indication of decreased anti-fracture efficacy for the remainder of the studies. 
Furthermore, data from two fracture studies in rodents and cynomolgus monkeys did not indicate a different 
effect of romosozumab on bone strength or bone mass at the fracture site or other sites when given in 
connection with a fracture. Thus, so far, non-clinical and clinical data do not indicate a need for restricting the 
timing of initiation of romosozumab treatment after a fracture. 
Additional analysis 
Fracture events (New radiological vertebral, Clinical vertebral and non-vertebral, Non-vertebral, Hip 
fractures) for the studies 20110142 and 20070337 were calculated for a subpopulation that would have been 
included according to the restricted indication (severe osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of 
fracture) and contraindications (History of myocardial infarction or stroke) as proposed by the applicant 
during the procedure. These calculations are summarised below. Of note, this is a post-hoc analysis.

Bone mineral density 
In studies 20070337 and 20110174, the increase in BMD compared to baseline was higher in the 
romosozumab group than in the placebo group at all locations through month 12 and month 24; p<0.001 at 
all locations and time points.  
Through month 12, percent change from baseline lumbar spine BMD was comparable between the studies; 
however, the percent changes from baseline BMD in the romosozumab group were more modest in both total 
hip and femoral neck, resulting in a lower LS mean difference between romosozumab and placebo in study 
20110174. The Applicant has provided information indicating that there is no correlation between baseline 
weight and the difference in romosozumab effect on BMD in total hip and femoral neck between men and 
women, indicating that this difference is not explained by differences in mean weight between the studies. 
The Applicant speculates that the difference in effect may, in part, be due to the lower baseline BMD in study 
20070337 caused by different inclusion criteria. No such differences were seen between study 20070337 and 
20110142 despite the difference in baseline BMD. The reason for the difference between men and women in 
this context remains unclear.   
Similarly, in study 20110142, romosozumab increased BMD compared to alendronate (p<0.001 at all 
locations and time points). This was consistent with the results in study 20060326, where the 210 mg QM 
dose was also associated with greater increases in BMD at the lumbar spine and total hip than the 2 active 
controls, alendronate and teriparatide. 
In the analyses through month 12 in study 20070337, treatment differences across demographic subgroups 
(ie, age and geographic region) ranged from 12.0% to 14.4% for the lumbar spine and from 4.7% to 6.6% 
for the total hip and were more or less consistent with the treatment differences observed for the overall 
population (12.7% for lumbar spine and 5.8% for total hip at month 12). At month 36, romosozumab 
followed by denosumab resulted in continued increases in BMD at the lumbar spine, total hip, and femoral 
neck compared with placebo followed by denosumab. It is noted, that also in the Central/Latin American 
(CLA) population BMD-increase at month 12 was significant compared to placebo.  The increase of BMD at 
total hip was even most pronounced in the region Central/Latin America with a treatment difference of 6.6% 
at month 12. For this same region, no reduction in the non-vertebral fracture rate was seen in the 
romosozumab group compared to the placebo arm. This finding could question the relationship between 
fracture risk reduction and increasing BMD under treatment with romosozumab. 
The Applicant clarified on request that this was explained by the too low non-vertebral fracture risk and 
background fracture rate among the CLA population, representing about 43% of study population, rather 
than lack of efficacy. The median 10-year probability of major fractures and hip fractures in the CLA 
population were 7.26% and 3.02%, respectively, which was only slightly lower than the male fracture risk 
and about half of the risk of the “Rest of world”- population (i.e. after exclusion of the CLA population), where 
significant fracture risk reduction also in non-vertebral locations could be demonstrated.  
Results of the Imaging Substudy I showed that Romosozumab (months 6 and 12) and 
romosozumab/denosumab (months 18 and 24) did not have a significant impact on BMD in the forearm, as 
evaluated by DXA BMD at the distal 1/3 radius and total radius. BMD in the forearm was even lower in 
subjects who received 12 months of romosozumab compared with those who received placebo. Consistent 
with the results for radius BMD by DXA, evaluation of the radius by HR-pQCT did not show significant 
differences in the double-blind period between romosozumab and placebo for volumetric BMD (total, cortical, 
trabecular). As potential reasons for this finding, the Applicant mentions the non-weight bearing nature of 
this skeletal site and the documented less responsivity of the distal radius for all pharmacological therapies 
for osteoporosis. Furthermore, even decreases in BMD at the distal radius during osteoporosis treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 131/263 
  
  
have been reported in literature (Cosman et al, 2015). A conclusive interpretation of the fracture protective 
effect of romosozumab on forearm fractures remains however unclear.  
During the off-treatment phase of study 20060326, the effect on lumbar spine BMD of the initial 
romosozumab treatment was sustained only with follow-up treatment with denosumab. Retreatment after a 
period without treatment was comparable to the initial treatment, whereas the increase in BMD with 
romosozumab retreatment after denosumab was small in lumbar spine and lacking in total hip and femoral 
neck in this small number of subjects. This may in part be secondary to the effect on bone turnover markers 
with romosozumab retreatment after denosumab (see Dose-response study 20060326). 
Study 20060326 is the only data source for both off-treatment and re-exposure to romosozumab and no 
efficacy conclusions can be made due to the limited number of study participants. 
Bone biopsy studies  
Evaluation of bone formation/resorption and structure parameters by histology, histomorphometry and 
micro-CT was performed at months 2, 12 and 24. At month 2, most dynamic and static bone formation 
parameters were elevated in the romosozumab group compared to placebo in the cancellous and endocortical 
compartments. In intracortical compartment, only double-label surface and mineralising surfaces increased. 
At month 2 in the cancellous compartment, the median %change in mineralizing surface in the romosozumab 
group was 325.1% compared with 67.3% in placebo group. The data suggest that romosozumab increases 
the surface extent of active bone formation but not the rate at the level of the individual osteoblast after 2 
months. With regard to bone resorption parameters, a reduction was also evident in the cancellous and 
endocortical compartment. 
In contrast, at month 12, dynamic and static bone formation parameters were significantly lower in the 
romosozumab group in the cancellous compartment. This decrease is probably secondary to the decrease in 
the rate of bone remodelling, consistent with self-regulation of bone formation. It is however acknowledged 
that at 12 months, bone structure parameters (trabecular thickness, bone volume to tissue volume, wall 
thickness, and cortical thickness) were significantly increased in the romosozumab compared to the placebo 
group. With regard to bone resorption, sustained inhibition was still seen after 1 year of treatment, which is 
also favourable. 
The presented parameters overall indicate an increased bone formation during the first weeks and a 
maintained decrease in bone resorption also during the late treatment phase, i.e. at month 12. A more 
thorough discussion on the clinical relevance of the different parameters on a qualitative and quantitative 
level would have been expected. On the other hand, it is agreed that bone histomorphometry data are 
exploratory in nature and primarily used for safety reasons due to certain limitations for example the fact 
that the samples represent a small fraction of the skeleton and may not be representative of other sites. 
Furthermore, the number of patients from who biopsies have been taken is small. Consequently, it is hard to 
draw any firm conclusions from the biopsies. It is also of interest that bone histomorphometry samples are 
taken at a non-weight bearing site, which may be a potential explanation to the fact that the effect of 
romosozumab in bone formation parameters is not as large at such sites as in e.g. vertebral bones. 
Study 20080289 - Switch study 
In study 20080289, romosozumab increased total hip BMD measured by DXA (primary endpoint) compared 
to 20 µg QD TPTD through 12 months of treatment, indicating that previous treatment with bisphosphonates 
does not attenuate the romosozumab effect bone mineral density. Furthermore, all (key) secondary and 
exploratory endpoints were met for the ITT and PP analyses sets. Bone formation marker (P1NP) showed an 
initial superior effect compared to teriparatide but trended then back to baseline values while teriparatide 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 132/263 
  
  
continued to increase. Bone resorption marker (CTX) slightly declined during the first 14 days with 
romosozumab and returned to baseline by month 3. With teriparatide, CTX increased and remained above 
baseline for the whole treatment period. 
It is notable that in this study, there was no difference from baseline in total hip BMD with 12 months of 
TPTD treatment (LS mean -0.65). As opposed to this, in study 20060326, 20 µg TPTD increased total hip 
BMD compared to placebo (1.3% vs -0.7; p<0.0001). The TPTD effect was comparable to the effect of 
romosozumab 70 mg QM and 140 mg Q3M, but lower than 140 mg QM and 210 mg QM. The main difference 
between the two studies was that in study 20060326, the use of bisphosphonates within a pre-specified time 
limit was an exclusion criterion.  
In study 20080289, most of the patients were pre-treated with alendronate (92.7% and 88.1% for 
teriparatide and romosozumab, respectively). Literature indicates that anabolic responsiveness to teriparatide 
differs based on prior antiresorptive therapy, and that the use of alendronate may blunt the magnitude of the 
effect. Generalizability of the results of study 20080289 to all bisphosphonate pre-treated patients cannot 
indisputably be concluded. The applicant proposed to address this in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Additional expert consultation 
CHMP requested an ad hoc expert meeting to obtain the opinion of experts in the field of osteoporosis, 
cardiology as well as geriatrics, and from patient representatives, on various aspects of the efficacy data and 
the issue of increased rate of CV events observed in studies with romosozumab. Questions were addressed to 
the ad hoc expert group. The corresponding answers are presented below: 
Question 1 
The target population of the most recently proposed indication for romosozumab (severe 
osteoporosis) was mainly studied in phase III PMO study 20110142. The AHEG is asked to 
comment on different aspects of the efficacy results from this study: 
a.  The incidences of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures were lower in the 
romosozumab compared to the alendronate group, but statistical significance was 
not reached for the difference in non-vertebral fractures at the end of romosozumab 
treatment at month 12. Please comment on the clinical relevance of these results, 
also considering that alendronate has been shown to be superior to placebo in 
reducing non-vertebral fractures in other studies. 
There was clear evidence of efficacy with regard to reduction of new vertebral fractures in both 
pivotal trials 20070337 (FRAME study; romosozumab vs. placebo) and 20110142 (ARCH study; 
romosozumab vs. alendronate) at the 12 month time point as well as later time points.  
While it was acknowledged that statistical significance was not yet reached for the reduction of non-
vertebral fractures at the 12 month time points, i.e. at time of completion of the romosozumab 
treatment phase, this reached statistical significance at 33 month, also for hip fractures. The experts 
found it adequate to consider the overall longer term benefit beyond 12 months.  
Also considering that the superiority outcome was achieved in comparison with alendronate in study 
20110142 the experts found the efficacy of romosozumab to be very compelling.  
b.  Do you consider that romosozumab improves the treatment options in the proposed 
target population e.g. based on a unique mechanism of action, a clinically relevant 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 133/263 
  
  
rapid increase of BMD and/or for patients previously treated with bisphosphonates, 
also taking into account data obtained with teriparatide and the fact that 
romosozumab has not been compared to denosumab or zoledronic acid in clinical 
studies? 
According to the experts, the demonstrated efficacy (outlined above), accompanied by the rapid 
increase of BMD at various sites and its close correlation with a reduction in fracture risk (as evident 
in study 20070337), would constitute a valuable therapeutic option for patients with high risk of 
fracture.  
In comparison with the only currently available osteoanabolic agent, teriparatide, advantages were 
seen e.g. regarding a better response of cortical bone, or when teriparatide is contraindicated. 
Although there was no direct comparison with e.g. denosumab or zoledronate, the chosen 
comparator alendronate is considered standard of care and, based on expected increases in bone 
mineral density (BMD), may not be assumed to be less efficacious than other bisphosphonates, such 
as zoledronate, according to some of the experts. 
The applicant currently proposes the use in “severe osteoporosis . . . at high risk of fracture”. The 
definition of this population might somewhat vary depending on country and guideline applied; in 
general it would be expected to comprise patients whose DEXA-measured BMD falls below a certain 
threshold and who have already experienced certain types of osteoporotic fracture. This was thought 
to represent an adequate population, with some experts finding it useful to also allow treatment of 
patients with a very high risk of fracture based on e.g. FRAX score and other estimates or e.g. a very 
low BMD. 
A bridging study (study 20110174, BRIDGE study) was used to extrapolate fracture efficacy from the 
postmenopausal population to male patients based on similar increases in the surrogate parameter of 
BMD with a primary analysis after 12 months. This was in principle found to be adequate by design. 
However, as the increase in BMD in male patients was only about half of what was achieved with 
romosozumab in postmenopausal women for measurements  at total hip (3.0 vs 5.8% placebo-
corrected increase) and femoral neck (2.4 vs 5.2% placebo-corrected increase) the experts 
questioned whether efficacy in men should be accepted. Hypotheses regarding the reasons included 
the possibility of under-dosing in, on average, heavier male patients. 
While intended for treatment-naïve patients, the experts did not discount the possibility of treating 
patients with romosozumab with prior exposure to anti-resorptive agents, in particular 
bisphosphonates. 
Question 2 
In PMO study 20110142, as well as in the bridging study in men and in the supportive study 
20080289, there was an increased incidence of CV events in patients receiving romosozumab 
compared to the comparator (alendronate, placebo and teriparatide, respectively). The AHEG is 
asked to discuss the adequacy and the feasibility of the risk minimization measures proposed by 
the Applicant (as below) and to discuss any potential additional measures. 
a.  Contraindication in patients with previous MI or stroke 
The experts shared the concern of an increase in CV events associated with romosozumab observed 
in some of the studies.  
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 134/263 
  
  
No evidence of a protective effect of alendronate to explain the difference is apparent, nor was 
another explanation identified by the experts. It was acknowledged that the increased relative risk of 
CV events was observed throughout the entire patient population without apparent significant 
differences between different subgroups. The views were split regarding the adequacy to 
contraindicate the use of romosozumab based on a history of an MI or stroke. While some experts 
found no scientific reason to specifically exclude patients with such a prior event from treatment, 
others found the restriction to be useful. Some experts proposed a warning instead of a 
contraindication. It was generally acknowledged that such a contraindication would reduce the CV risk 
in absolute terms, however the relative reduction of the risk associated with romosozumab treatment 
would appear to change little.  
It was considered whether exclusion of patients with a fixed age cut-off, e.g. >75 years, could 
improve the risk profile sufficiently to justify exclusion of this population but this possibility was not 
supported by the majority of experts. 
b.  Information in the SmPC about the increased risk and a recommendation that “the 
prescribing physician should carefully evaluate the individual benefit-risk balance of 
using romosozumab treatment”. 
Experts supported the notion that treatment with romosozumab would be an individualized treatment 
decision; it was pointed out that the initiation of such therapy, for example in Germany and the UK, 
would most likely be in specialized centres in any case. 
c.  Post approval observational safety study 
To further characterize cardiovascular risk associated with romosozumab, ideally a randomized 
controlled cardiovascular outcome trial would be preferred, but it was acknowledged, given the lack 
of enrichment of CV risk in romosozumab treated patients, that such a study would need to be very 
large. The experts had concerns whether the currently proposed observational study could 
satisfactorily adjust for the expected channelling bias of relatively higher CV risk patients away from 
romosozumab treatment. A proposal by the experts therefore was a randomized, non-blinded, 
registry-based type of study.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Efficacy and safety in postmenopausal women were assessed in two large pivotal studies, an alendronate-
controlled study 20110142 (N=4,093) and a placebo-controlled study 20070337 (N=7,180). Subjects in 
Study 20110142 were on average 4 years older than subjects in Study 20070337 and had more severe 
osteoporosis according to the inclusion criteria. There was also a higher rate of history of hypertension in 
Study 20110142. Romosozumab was intended for a 12 months’ time-limited treatment followed by anti-
resorptive therapy. In both studies, patients were treated with romosozumab 210 mg SC once a month or 
with placebo/alendronate for 12 months in total. Thereafter, all subjects in study 20070337 received 
denosumab for additional 24 months. In study 20110142 all subjects were treated with alendronate until end 
of study. In the two pivotal studies romosozumab reduced the risk of new radiological vertebral fractures at 
12 and 24 months compared to placebo (Study 20070337; 0.5% vs 1.8% through 12 months and 0.6% vs 
2.5% through 24 months) and compared to alendronate (Study 20110142; 3.2% vs 5.0% through 12 
months and 4.1% vs 8.0% through 24 months). In study 20110142, romosozumab also reduced the risk of 
clinical fractures (vertebral and non-vertebral) compared to alendronate at 12 months (3.9% vs 5.4%) and 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 135/263 
  
  
 
compared to alendronate at the time point of primary analysis (9.7% vs 13.0%). Thus, the predefined 
primary endpoints were met. The effect on non-vertebral fractures (secondary endpoint) did not reach 
statistical significance in the placebo-controlled study 20070337. In Study 20110142, the effect of 
romosozumab was superior to alendronate for reducing the risk of non-vertebral fractures (11% vs 9%) and 
hip fractures (3.2% vs 2.0%) at the time of primary analysis at 33 months. Head to head comparisons of 
romosozumab with other potent antiresorptive treatments, such as zolendronic acid and denosumab, were 
not available which may be considered as a limitation. Therefore, sequential therapy of romosozumab 
followed by alendronate achieved benefit over current standard of care in both vertebral and non-vertebral 
fractures. Rapid BMD gains were achieved with romosozumab versus comparators (alendronate, teriparatide) 
in the first 12 months. The absolute risk reduction in non-vertebral fractures in PMO studies was small in both 
PMO studies, however, superiority in terms of fracture reduction across vertebral, clinical, and non-vertebral 
fractures over alendronate has been demonstrated in the presented trials. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile in the osteoporotic population was evaluated across 4 placebo-controlled studies over the 
12-month treatment period between the romosozumab 210 mg group and placebo in the integrated analysis. 
In addition, with the emerging safety data from Study 20110142, the safety profile of romosozumab was 
evaluated in the integrated analysis across the 7 studies in the phase 2/3 program utilizing the following data 
presentation: 
• 
Integrated data across all phase 2 and phase 3 studies (excluding Study 20110142) for the placebo group 
and the romosozumab 210 mg QM group 
•  Data from Study 20110142 for the alendronate group and the romosozumab 210 mg QM group 
• 
Integrated data across all phase 2 and phase 3 studies including Study 20110142 for: 
-the integrated control groups (placebo, alendronate, teriparatide); 
-romosozumab 210 mg QM; and 
-total romosozumab groups (any dosing and frequency including every 3 months [Q3M]). 
Discussions are focused on the following two sets: 
12-month placebo-controlled osteoporosis safety analysis set: Subjects who were randomized and received at 
least 1 dose of romosozumab 210 mg QM or placebo in the 12-month placebo-controlled osteoporosis 
randomized analysis set. 
The 12-month data for subjects in this analysis set are used to summarize safety endpoints. 
Osteoporosis safety analysis set: Subjects who were randomized and received at least 1 dose of 
romosozumab (any dose or frequency) or control (placebo, alendronate, teriparatide) in the phase 2 and 
phase 3 osteoporosis studies. For this analysis set, 24-month data from 20060326, 12-month data from 
20070337, 12-month data from 20080289, 12-month data from 20101291, 12-month data from 20110142, 
12-month data from 20110174, and 6-month data from 20120156 were used to summarize safety endpoints 
and presented mostly as “exposure adjusted incidence rates”.

Separate comprehensive integrated reports were provided for immunogenicity and cardiovascular safety.   
Patient exposure 
Safety data are submitted from an extensive safety database that includes 11553 subjects in 19 
romosozumab clinical studies who received at least 1 dose of romosozumab (n = 7681) or placebo (n = 
3872). Additionally, the integrated control group for the osteoporosis safety analysis set includes 6155 
subjects who received placebo, alendronate, teriparatide, and/or denosumab. However, the number of male 
subjects with osteoporosis, who received at least 1 dose of romosozumab (n=163), is very limited. The 
majority of exposed subjects were older than 65 years, which is acceptable due to the generally late onset of 
osteoporosis. No paediatric patients were studied.

Overview of adverse events 
The total number of adverse events was generally comparable in the clinical studies between romosozumab 
and control groups. The number of treatment related AEs was somewhat higher in the Romosozumab group.

The most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis, headache, cough, arthralgia, dyspepsia and oedema 
peripheral and muscle spasms with no striking differences between treatment groups. The pattern of 
common and treatment associated adverse events presents similarly in the male osteoporosis population. 
Injection site pain and cataracts seem to be more common in the Romosozumab group. Nasopharyngitis 
(13.6% vs 12.6%), arthralgia (12.4% vs 11.8%), headache (6.5% vs 5.9%), muscle spasms (4.4% vs 
3.9%), neck pain (2.1% vs 1.5%), cataract (2.0% vs 1.5%), injection site pain (1.8% vs 1.2%), injection 
site erythema (1.5% vs 0.2%), sinusitis (1.4% vs 0.8%), and injection site pruritus (0.7% vs 0.2%) are 
proposed to be labelled in the SmPC with a frequency “common” or “very common”.

* The number of fatal adverse events in the control group of the subgroup of patients ≥75 years was 
corrected from n=25 to n=26 during the procedure. 
In the pooled pivotal trials, there was a numerical imbalance in fatal events with HR 1.20 and 1.37 in the two 
large PMO studies. In the subgroup of patients ≥75 years fatal adverse events occurred stat. significantly 
more often under romosozumab treatment as compared to control (either alendronate or placebo), fatal 
events occurred in 46 (2.0%) patients treated with Romosozumab and 26 (1.2%) of controls, HR 1.71 (1.06-
2.78). The imbalance was mainly due to fatal cardiovascular events and neoplasms. 
Baseline co-morbidities/risk factors between treatment groups within each age subgroup, were not 
consistently favouring control or romosozumab groups. It was also not possible to identify age specific other 
risk factors for fatal events that would be specific for Romosozumab group. 
There are numerous variables that can play a role in the fatal outcome of an event and the causality to 
romosozumab is not possible to determine in individual cases. However, an osteoporosis drug that reduces 
fractures in older population would be expected to possibly reduce all-cause mortality, not the opposite.  
Other significant adverse events 
Based on the mechanism of action, the pharmacologic profile of romosozumab, potential class effects of 
bone-forming agents, observations made during the nonclinical and clinical program, and Agency feedback, 
additional adverse event evaluations were conducted. Adverse events of interest included hypocalcaemia, 
hypersensitivity, injection site reactions, malignancies, hyperostosis, osteoarthritis, atypical femoral fractures 
and osteonecrosis of the jaw. Independent adjudication of serious cardiovascular events was pre-specified in 
the 3 pivotal phase 3 studies. The events are summarised in the tables below and are thereafter discussed 
one by one.

Table 53: Summary of Exposure-adjusted Incidence Rate of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
of Interest (Osteoporosis Safety Analysis Set) 
Hypocalcaemia 
The mechanism of action of romosozumab suggests that administration of romosozumab may be associated 
with decreases in serum calcium as a result of increased bone formation and increased demands for calcium 
for matrix mineralization. Four subjects (< 0.1%), all in the romosozumab 210 mg group had a 
hypocalcaemia adverse event in the Osteoporosis Safety Analysis Set. In the alendronate-controlled Study 
20110142, during the 12-month double-blind period, 1 (< 0.1%) adverse event of hypocalcaemia (preferred 
term) was reported in each treatment group. 
Only few adverse events of hypocalcaemia were reported as adverse events in the clinical studies. However, 
transient decrease in S-calcium has been observed in patients receiving romosozumab; see section 
“laboratory findings” below. Hypocalcaemia is proposed as an identified risk for romosozumab, it is included 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 148/263 
  
  
 
 
in SmPC as a warning in section 4.4 and is listed as an undesirable effect in Section 4.8 with a frequency 
“uncommon” (Defined as albumin adjusted serum calcium that was below the lower limit of normal) in the 
table in section 4.8. This risk is further increase in patients with renal impairment; see section safety in 
special populations. 
Hypersensitivity and injection site reactions 
Overall, when hypersensitivity cases were medically reviewed across the 12-month placebo-controlled 
osteoporosis safety analysis set, there were no anaphylactic reactions reported that were attributable to 
romosozumab. In Study 20070337, the subject incidence of potential anaphylactic reactions was generally 
similar between both treatment groups and both study periods.  
In the 12-month placebo-controlled osteoporosis population, the most frequently reported (> 0.5%) adverse 
events were rash (romosozumab: 1.1%; placebo: 0.9%), dermatitis allergic (0.7%; 0.8%), eczema (0.6%; 
0.8%), rhinitis allergic (0.6%, 0.7%), urticaria (0.5%, 0.6%), and dermatitis (0.4%, 0.8%).  
Adverse events potentially related to hypersensitivity led to discontinuation from investigational product for 
11 (0.3%) subjects in the total romosozumab group and 6 (0.2%) subjects in the placebo group. 
Serious adverse events corresponding to terms potentially related to hypersensitivity reactions were reported 
for 6 (0.2%) subjects in the total romosozumab group (all in Study 20070337, and 1 (< 0.1%) subject in the 
placebo group (Study 20060326). 
In study 20110142, serious adverse events potentially related to hypersensitivity were reported for 3 (0.1%) 
subjects in the romosozumab group and 2 (< 0.1%) subjects in the alendronate group. One subject had 
angioedema. Hypersensitivity is proposed to be labelled as an adverse event for romosozumab, section 4.8 in 
the SmPC. Also warnings in section 4.4 is proposed and endorsed. 
There was an imbalance of injection site reactions to the disadvantage of romosozumab in all pivotal studies 
and this is a common adverse drug reaction for romosozumab included under Section 4.8 Unidesirable Effects 
of the SmPC. No serious adverse events of injection site reactions were reported in the pivotal studies. The 
most frequent reactions were injection site pain and injection site erythema. 
Malignant or unspecified tumours 
Although sclerostin expression has been reported in a limited number of soft tissue and bone tumours, there 
is no current evidence that the presence or absence of sclerostin is related to malignant potential. There are 
no reports of an increased cancer incidence in patients with sclerosteosis or van Buchem disease. Although 
the high-dose group in the 2-year rat bioassay, performed by the applicant reported osteosarcomas in two 
rats these findings were not attributed to romosozumab exposure: no other study parameters showed 
precursor osteoblastic changes, and also because of its low incidence largely matching with historical 
background data for osteosarcomas. 
In the 12-month placebo-controlled osteoporosis safety analysis set, adverse events of malignant or 
unspecified tumors were reported for 1.4% of subjects in the total romosozumab treatment group and 1.6% 
of subjects in the placebo group; serious adverse events were reported for 1.0% and 1.1% of subjects, 
respectively. Preferred terms reported for ≥ 0.2% of subjects in either treatment group were basal cell 
carcinoma (0.3%, 0.5%) and lung neoplasm malignant (0.2%, 0.2%). 
The subject incidences of lymphomas and leukemia were low and balanced between the romosozumab and 
placebo groups. Similar pictures were observed in the Osteoporosis Safety Analysis Set (exposure-adjusted 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 149/263 
  
  
 
incidence rate per 100 subject-years of adverse events of malignant or unspecified tumors was 1.5 in the 
total romosozumab and romosozumab 210 mg groups and 1.6 in the integrated control group) and the male 
osteoporosis set (romosozumab: 1.8%; placebo: 2.5%). 
 In the re-exposed group (Romosozumab Retreatment Period, Month 36-48), malignancies were reported for 
6 subjects (3.6%), of which 5 were subjects who had received romosozumab during the first 2 years of the 
study (breast cancer, invasive ductal breast carcinoma, lung neoplasm malignant, squamous cell carcinoma 
of lung, and squamous cell carcinoma of skin): the first 4 events were considered serious adverse events. No 
adverse event of malignancy was considered by the investigator to be related to investigational product, and 
the incidences between romosozumab and placebo were similar: [3.6% [5 subjects] versus 3.7% [1 subject 
with thyroid cancer]]. This can be accepted.  
The applicant also further investigated the small difference in deaths observed in the 12-month Placebo-
Controlled Osteoporosis Safety Analysis Set that was driven by fatal malignant lung cancer (4 subjects 
(0.1%) in the romosozumab 210mg QM SC treatment group [N=3581] compared with 0 in the placebo 
treatment group [N=3576]) 
The individual case reports of these four patients reveal strong risk factors for developing the disease, such 
as long-term smoking, and COPD that would make a connection of romosozumab in the development of the 
disease unlikely. A certain deficiency in the applicant’s line of argumentation is the lack of comparison 
regarding the occurrence of risk factors between treatment and placebo arm. The applicant furthermore 
presented tables discussing incidences and exposure adjusted incidences of lower respiratory tract 
malignancies in the 12 months placebo-controlled osteoporosis with no imbalances identified to placebo and 
alendronate treatment. 
In addition, the applicant investigated, as requested, whether, after cessation of treatment, increased 
incidences of malignancies in general could be observed. This was evaluated for extension phases of studies 
20070337, 20110142, 20060326, 20101291, and 20120156. No evidence was found that patients who had 
previously been treated with romosozumab have a higher probability to develop a malignancy after cessation 
of treatment, as compared to placebo and or control. This diminishes uncertainty regarding a potential 
association between romosozumab long term exposure and the development of malignancies. 
Cataracts:

controlled Osteoporosis Safety Analysis Set)

Table 55: Treatment-emergent Cataracts Adverse events by Preferred Term for subjects without 
prior history of cataracts (12-month Placebo-controlled Osteoporosis Safety Analysis Set) 
Cataracts were frequent and occurred more frequently in the romosozumab arm in clinical studies in patients 
without prior history of cataracts. The baseline characteristics were balanced between romosozumab and 
placebo patients in the cataract analysis sets.  
Even if the available non-clinical data presented by the applicant do not indicate that sclerostin or 
romosozumab have a direct action in the lens in the eye, for example changes in calcium concentration may 
be a risk factor for cataracts. Cataracts are labelled in the SmPC. 
Hyperostosis 
Patients with genetic disorders such as sclerosteosis and van Buchem disease that result in a life-long 
absence and/or decrease of sclerostin have an increase in both bone density and bone mass. Neurologic 
sequelae due to hyperostosis in these patients with the genetic absence of sclerostin include nerve 
compression, facial paralysis, deafness, visual changes, and headache from increased intracranial pressure.  
Audiology substudy 
Study 20070337 included an audiology substudy of 498 subjects to assess the effect of romosozumab 
treatment for 12 months compared with placebo on the incidence of hearing loss (defined as subjects 
meeting the American Speech-Language-Hearing Association criteria for ototoxicity), and mean change from 
baseline in hearing threshold (assessed as change from baseline in pure tone average; defined as [1] loss of 
≥ 20 dB at any single frequency or [2] loss of ≥ 10 dB at any 2 adjacent frequencies or [3] loss of response 
at 3 consecutive frequencies where responses were previously obtained). The subject incidence of hearing 
loss at baseline was similar between romosozumab and placebo groups, and no significant difference in 
average change in hearing threshold was observed between the romosozumab and placebo groups at month 
12 as assessed by the mean change from baseline in pure tone average. 
BMD T-Scores 
The human genetic diseases sclerosteosis and van Buchem disease stem from lifelong sclerostin deficiency 
and can result in a markedly increased BMD. No excessive increases in BMD were observed in clinical studies. 
The subject incidence of maximum post-baseline T-score > 2 at the lumbar spine was < 0.1% (1 subject) in 
the romosozumab group and <0.1% (1 subject) in the placebo group. No subject had a maximum post-
baseline T-score > 2 at the total hip or femoral neck. 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 151/263 
  
  
 
The overall data do not give strong support that hyperostosis would be a potential risk with romosozumab 
treatment of skeletally mature osteoporosis patients. 
Osteoarthritis 
Current literature supports a role of canonical Wnt signalling in the maintenance of articular cartilage and that 
dysregulation of the pathway could negatively affect cartilage health. Sclerostin is expressed in articular 
cartilage but its role in maintenance of cartilage health is unclear. In a nonclinical rodent model of 
osteoarthritis, Sci-Ab at doses up to 7 times the clinical dose of 210 mg QM on a mg/kg basis increased bone 
mass as anticipated, with no effects on cartilage thickness or area (Roudier et al, 2013)  
In the 12-month placebo-controlled osteoporosis safety analysis set, adverse events of osteoarthritis were 
reported for 7.9% of subjects in the total romosozumab treatment group and 8.6% of subjects in the placebo 
group; serious adverse events were reported for 0.2% and 0.5%, respectively. Osteoarthritis adverse events 
(preferred terms) reported for ≥ 0.5% of subjects in either treatment group were osteoarthritis 
(romosozumab: 5.2%; placebo: 6.0%), spinal osteoarthritis (2.4% each group), and arthritis (0.5%; 0.3%).  
Results for the osteoporosis safety analysis set were generally similar to the 12-month placebo-controlled 
osteoporosis safety analysis set. The exposure-adjusted incidence rates per 100 subject-years of adverse 
events of osteoarthritis were 8.0 in the total romosozumab group, 8.1 in the romosozumab 210 mg group, 
and 8.7 in the integrated control group; serious adverse events occurred at rates of 0.3, 0.3, and 0.4, 
respectively. 
Overall, clinical data does neither suggest elevated incidences of osteoarthritis in romosozumab women, nor 
lead to a faster progression of the disease as evaluated in Study 20070337, which included an osteoarthritis 
substudy of 343 subjects where no significant progression of osteoarthritis of the knee was observed for 
subjects in the romosozumab group compared with the placebo group at month 12, as assessed by the 
change from baseline in the WOMAC total and subscale scores. 
Tumor Necrosis Factor-Mediated Inflammatory Adverse Events 
Sclerostin has been proposed as having a role as a negative regulator of TNF-α production in synovium, and 
expression of sclerostin has been shown in synoviocytes from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (Wehmeyer 
et al, 2016). However, the findings of this paper are in conflict with other studies that do not indicate a role 
of sclerostin in regulation of TNF-α-mediated inflammation (Chen et al, 2013; Marenzana et al, 2013). 
There is also little data to suggest a role for sclerostin in another disease, ankylosing spondylitis, a condition 
where TNF-α is thought to play a role.  
For the 12-month placebo-controlled osteoporosis safety analysis set, the subject incidence of treatment-
emergent TNF-mediated inflammatory adverse events was 0.3% in the romosozumab group and 0.4% the 
placebo group. Results for the osteoporosis safety analysis set were generally similar to the 12-month 
placebo-controlled osteoporosis safety analysis set. The exposure-adjusted incidence rate per 100 subject-
years of adverse events of TNF-mediated inflammatory diseases was 0.4 in the total romosozumab and 
romosozumab 210 mg groups and 0.5 in the integrated control group. The exposure-adjusted incidence rates 
per 100 subject-years were 8.2 in the total romosozumab group, 9.2 in the romosozumab 210 mg group, and 
10.7 in the integrated control group for subjects with a prior history of a TNF-mediated inflammatory disease.  
In the male osteoporosis Study 20110174, the subject incidence of treatment-emergent TNF-mediated 
inflammatory adverse events was 1.2% (2 subjects) in the romosozumab group and 0.0% the placebo group. 
On the whole TNF mediated inflammatory adverse events show a similar pattern of incidence as osteoarthritis 
with no relevant differences between romosozumab treated patients vs. placebo and/or control.

Sarcopenia 
Theoretically, sarcopenia may be associated with sclerostin inhibition. Reduced muscle weight was recently 
reported in a study in sclerostin knock-out mice. The basis for this finding is unclear as sclerostin is not 
expressed in skeletal muscle. However, the weight of evidence from other nonclinical studies support that 
sclerostin deficiency or inhibition does not negatively affect muscle mass (Section 3.4.10 of Module 2.6.2, 
Pharmacology Written Summary). Sarcopenia is not reported in patients with sclerosteosis (Hamersma et al, 
2003). In the 12-month placebo-controlled osteoporosis safety analysis set, adverse events of sarcopenia 
(narrow and broad scope) were reported for 5.8% of subjects in the total romosozumab group and 5.8% of 
subjects in the placebo group. 
Sarcopenia adverse events (preferred terms) reported for ≥ 0.5% of subjects in either treatment group were 
asthenia (romosozumab: 2.2%; placebo: 2.2%), fatigue (1.3%; 1.5%), weight decreased (0.6%; 0.3%), 
muscle contracture (0.6%; 0.5%), muscular weakness (0.5% each), and musculoskeletal stiffness (0.5%; 
0.5%). Although an evaluation of muscle size or performance was not performed, lean tissue mass was 
calculated for 83 subjects in Study 20070337 who participated in the Forearm and Total Body dual-energy X-
ray absorptiometry (DXA) and high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR pQCT 
Imaging I) substudy. 
The data indicate that the decrease in lean tissue mass measured by DXA was observed in a substudy of 
romosozumab treated patients in study 20070337 [romosozumab 210mg once a month for 1 year/ decrease 
in lean tissue mass (-1.6%) relative to the placebo group] was a consequence of an increase in bone mass 
and not of a decrease in muscle mass. 
Atypical femoral fracture 
In the 12-month placebo-controlled osteoporosis safety analysis set, 1 subject in the romosozumab group 
had a positively adjudicated serious adverse event of AFF. The event occurred after 3.5 months of 
romosozumab treatment and the patient had a history of prodromal pain and a low screening vitamin D level. 
In study 20110142, positively adjudicated AFF cases were identified during the open-label alendronate 
treatment period for 2 subjects in the romosozumab/alendronate group and 4 subjects in the 
alendronate/alendronate group during the primary analysis period. The 2 subjects in the 
romosozumab/alendronate group who had AFFs during the open-label alendronate treatment period 
(Subjects 35007008 and 68001053) experienced these events 655 and 492 days, respectively, after the first 
dose of alendronate. One additional positively adjudicated adverse event of AFF was noted for Study 
20110142 (Subject 14228003174) after the snapshot date of 27 February 2017. This 79-year old Asian 
woman received romosozumab for 12 months (2013 to 2014) followed by alendronate (2014 to 2016), and 
partially withdrew consent in 2016. The subject had a serious adverse event of right femur fracture after a 
fall on 2017 (day 1360) during the primary analysis period. 
Atypical femur fractures are identified risk for other antiresorptive anti-osteoporotic agents and the risk is 
known to increase with increased treatment duration. They seldom occur during the first years of treatment 
and the evidence for other agents has been obtained post-marketing. Because inhibition of bone resorption is 
a component of the dual effect of romosozumab, there is a potential concern for increased risk of AFF. 
For romosozumab, one event occurred during romosozumab treatment and three additional events in 
patients who had received romosozumab and then received alendronate, which is a confounding factor. 
Following completion of romosozumab therapy, transition to other antiresorptive therapy is recommended in 
the current SmPC proposal for romosozumab and any postmarketing follow up of this risk will also be 
confounded.  
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 153/263 
  
  
However, based on the mechanism of action it is reasonable to conclude that romosozumab treatment has 
contributed to the AFF events that occurred in the clinical programme. Proposed warning text in SmPC 
section 4.4 is endorsed. 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) 
Osteonecrosis of the jaw has been observed with the use of antiresorptive agents. Preclinical data gives some 
support that romosozumab would not be associated with ONJ. However, none of these studies examined 
effects of romosozumab followed by another antiresorptive agent. 
In the 12-month placebo-controlled osteoporosis safety analysis set (excluding Study 20101291, for which 
events were not adjudicated), 1 subject in the romosozumab group and no placebo subject had a positively 
adjudicated case of ONJ. This case had continuous use of a maladaptive fitting denture. One additional 
positively adjudicated case of ONJ was identified in the romosozumab group of Study 20070337 after the 
double-blind period (subject was taking denosumab at the time). This case occurred after the administration 
of 1 dose of denosumab in a subject who had a prior non-serious adverse event of periodontitis. 
To date, in Study 20110142, there are a total of 3 positively ONJ events, all of which occurred during the 
open-label alendronate treatment period: 2 events occurred in the romosozumab/alendronate group and 1 
occurred in the alendronate/alendronate group. 
To date, a total of four cases of ONJ have been reported in the Romosozumab clinical programme, one during 
romosozumab treatment and three during following denosumab/alendronate treatment. This information 
should be included in the SmPC, in the table in section 4.8. Following completion of 1-year romosozumab 
therapy, transition to other antiresorptive therapy is recommended. Recommendations regarding oral 
hygiene are considered appropriate for romosozumab treated patients as for oral antiresorptive agents for 
osteoporosis in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Infections 
The subject incidence of infections was generally similar between treatment groups. The most frequently 
reported adverse events in the total romosozumab or placebo treatment groups were nasopharyngitis 
(13.6%, 12.6%), viral upper respiratory tract infection (5.4%, 6.0%), and influenza (4.6%, 5.0%). Events of 
rare and potentially opportunistic events reported only in the romosozumab 210 mg QM group were 1 event 
each of Mycobacterium avium complex infection (grade 3) and Cryptococcal pneumonia (grade 3). Pulmonary 
disease caused by Mycobacterium avium complex infection usually occurs in patients with chronic lung 
disease or deficient cellular immunity; however, it can affect persons without predisposing conditions, 
particularly elderly women.

Table 56: Treatment-emergent Serious Adverse Events by System Organ Class and Preferred Term 
(12-month Placebo-Controlled Osteoporosis Safety Analysis Set) 
A numerical imbalance in serious adverse events of infections in the largest pivotal placebo-controlled study 
20070337 was noted. 1.9% in the romosozumab group and 1.3% in the placebo group. In the male 
osteoporosis Study 2011017, serious adverse events in the system organ class of infections and infestations 
occurred at rates of 3.7% in the romosozumab group and 2.5% in the placebo group. However, no imbalance 
was evident in the study 20110142. 
Table 57: Exposure-adjusted Incidence Rate of Treatment-emergent Serious Adverse Events by 
System Organ Class and Preferred Term (Osteoporosis Safety Analysis Set) 
There was a numerical imbalance in serious adverse events of infections in the pivotal placebo-controlled 
studies, even when adjusted for patient years. The imbalance was marginally higher in subgroup of patients 
>75 years and the frequency of these events was overall somewhat higher in these patients, as shown in 
table 5. Pneumonia was the most frequent type of infection; however, when adjusted for patient years, no 
imbalance was evident. 
There is no clear biologic plausibility for increased risk of especially pneumonia, however, some effects on 
haematology parameters and white blood count were seen both in preclinical and clinical studies. 
Nasopharyngitis and sinusitis are currently the only type of infection that is proposed to be included in the 
Romosozumab SmPC. The CHMP considers that the data on serious infection should be taken into account

when discussing the benefit/risk of romosozumab especially in patients >75 years. Serious infection is 
included in the RMP as an important potential risk and also included as an endpoint for any further PASS 
studies of Romosozumab.  
Cardiovascular disorders 
Because sclerostin expression has been identified in the aorta and in vascular calcified foci, there is a 
theoretical concern that inhibition of sclerostin by romosozumab may promote or exacerbate vascular 
calcification. There is no reported increase in early onset vascular mineralization or cardiovascular disease in 
patients with sclerosteosis and van Buchem disease. Please also see data and discussion in the non-clinical 
section of this report. 
The primary endpoints in Studies 20070337 and 20110142 were not designed as cardiac outcome studies 
during which serious cardiac events are prospectively collected as the primary endpoints of the study. An 
external, independent adjudication of cardiovascular serious adverse events by Duke Clinical Research 
Institute (DCRI) in the 3 pivotal phase 3 studies (Studies 20070337, 20110142, and 20110174) in the 
romosozumab clinical program was pre-specified in the respective protocols and Clinical Events Classification 
(CEC) Charter. Per protocol, Studies 20070337, 20110142, and 20110174 specified independent adjudication 
of serious adverse events meeting a predefined list of terms reflecting potential cardiovascular events. 
Potential cardiovascular serious adverse events were captured from fatal adverse event reports, investigator-
identified cardiovascular serious adverse events, and from a predefined list of preferred terms of possible 
cardiovascular serious adverse events. Only serious adverse events meeting the predefined list of terms were 
systematically sent for adjudication. 
In order to confirm the results, a second review of all adverse event data in Studies 20070337, 20110142, 
and 20110174 by the TIMI (Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction) Study Group to identify potential 
cardiovascular adverse events. This approach included re-adjudication by TIMI of all deaths and other serious 
adverse events previously adjudicated by DCRI, blinded to treatment and DCRI adjudication result.

Heart Disease and CNS Haemorrhages and Cerebrovascular Conditions, irrespective of adjudication status.  
Of note, the numbers of reported AEs irrespective of adjudication status in tables above are higher 
(approximately double) than the numbers for adjudicated cases of same disorder (data presented in tables

Risk of cardiovascular events in a proposed new target population 
In response to the concerns of the CHMP, the Applicant has evaluated the cardiovascular risk profile of 
romosozumab in a new target population with severe osteoporosis and high risk for fracture and excluding 
patients with no history of myocardial infarction [MI] or stroke.  
In data from the Swedish National Health Register presented by the Applicant, exclusion of patients with a 
history of MI/stroke did bring the baseline risk of MI or stroke in an osteoporosis post-fracture population to a 
level similar to the general osteoporosis population.

Table 63: Summary of Baseline Cardiovascular Risk Factors (Safety Analysis Set) (Studies 
20070337, 20110142, and 20110174) 
An imbalance in positively-adjudicated cardiovascular serious adverse events was observed between 
treatment groups in the pivotal, active-comparator-controlled study in postmenopausal women with 
osteoporosis (Study 20110142). This imbalance was observed specifically for serious cardiac ischemic and 
Assessment report

cerebrovascular events, with a higher incidence in the romosozumab group compared with the alendronate 
group. These findings had not been observed in the placebo-controlled study in postmenopausal women with 
osteoporosis (Study 20070337). 
These divergent findings in 2 large randomized, controlled studies (balanced placebo-controlled and 
numerically-imbalanced active-controlled) lead to assessment of the overall clinical program, preclinical data, 
epidemiology, and biological plausibility.  
Between the studies, the most pronounced difference was in age: subjects in Study 20110142 were on 
average 4 years older than subjects in Study 20070337 and 2 years older than subjects in Study 20110174. 
To determine whether age helped clarify the discrepancy seen between the studies in the risk of positively-
adjudicated cardiovascular serious adverse events, the Applicant evaluated the safety risk using age-matched 
cohorts for the 2 pivotal phase 3 studies; however, the difference in age alone did not appear to explain the 
observed discrepancy between the 2 studies. Other differences between the studies included a somewhat 
higher rate of history of hypertension and, influenced by that, history of cardiovascular disease in Study 
20110142 compared with the other 2 studies.  
Presence of possible confounding factors in the male osteoporosis study was assessessed in detail. In the 
romosozumab group, more subjects had a CV-related past medical history (77.3% vs placebo 71.6%), while 
the Baseline use of CV-related concomitant medications and use of prior CV-related medications were lower 
in the romosozumab group (57.1% vs placebo 61.7%, and 57.7% vs placebo 65.4%, respectively). The 
study 20110174 was limited in size, only 244 men were randomized. A small numerical difference between 
treatment groups was noted in baseline “any history of cardiovascular risk factor” (72.2% and 76.1% in the 
placebo and romosozumab groups, respectively). However, smoking was not included in these numbers and 
was more common in the placebo group 63.0% vs 49.7%. Also renal impairment GFR <60 was numerically 
more common at baseline in placebo group as well as diabetes and hypertension. As the Applicants points 
out, the CV related medications were also higher in the placebo group. In light of these numbers, it seems 
actually that more patients in placebo group had multiple CV risk factors than in the romosozumab group. 
In summary, it is considered very unlikely that any imbalance in important CV risk factors at baseline would 
be a significant confounder in study 20110174, explaining the imbalance in the results.

Exploration of the Potential Impact of Age and Other Cardiovascular Risk Factors in Study 
20110142 vs Study 20070337 
Because the main difference in known cardiovascular risk differences between the populations in Studies 
20070337 and 20110142 was an older mean age of 4 years in Study 20110142, Amgen created 20070337 
and 20110142 cohorts that matched baseline age distribution. A total of 3848 of the 4093 subjects enrolled 
in Study 20110142 were age-matched to subjects enrolled in Study 20070337). Age-matched cohorts still 
yielded discordant cardiovascular serious adverse event results between the 2 studies, as shown in Figure 
below. Similar results were observed when the 2 populations were matched for age and modified-RUTH score 
(used to identify osteoporotic women with CV risk in Raloxifene use for the heart-study (Keech et al, 2005).

The age-matched cohorts still yielded discordant cardiovascular serious adverse event results between the 2 
studies. Similar results were observed when the 2 populations were matched for age and modified-RUTH 
score. However, interestingly matched (=overall higher) age and RUTH score seem to drive a difference 
between romosozumab and placebo in study 20070337 for cardiac ischemic events and Type 1 MI. 
Subgroups divided by age at least seem to show a certain trend that romosozumab could be more harmful 
for subjects as old or older than 75 years in terms of onset of serious CV events leading to death, serious MI, 
and serious stroke.

An increased risk in major adverse cardiovascular events in study 20110142 was noted in all subgroups 
regardless of previous CV related medical history. However, the absolute incidences of these events were 
lower in patients without history of CV risk factors and there was also a tendency to somewhat lower increase 
in the risk measured by hazard ratios.

adjudicated Cardiovascular Event Leading to Death, Serious Myocardial Infarction or Stroke 
(MACE-1) Through Month 12 (Safety Analysis Set) (Study 20110142 Primary Adhoc Analysis) 
Studies 20110142 and Study 20070337 had different inclusion/exclusion criteria regarding osteoporosis 
severity (T-scores and fractures). Only 14% of all included patients in these two pivotal PMO studies had 
overlapping inclusion criteria. Consequently, these two pivotal studies represent largely different osteoporosis 
populations. The patients in study 20110142 were older and had a more severe osteoporosis disease. A 
discrepancy in some safety results, such as treatment emergent MI and stoke events, between studies is thus 
not totally unexpected.   
Literature Review and Epidemiology Assessment 
One explanation for the difference between the 2 studies could be that alendronate exerts a protective effect 
against cardiovascular events in humans. The applicant evaluated the literature in animals and humans to 
further explore this hypothesis in detail in the Application (not included in this AR). Based on the assessment 
of clinical and preclinical studies in animals and humans, early cardiovascular events (ie, within 3 to 6 months 
of dosing) were observed with romosozumab, while the literature would suggest any possible cardioprotective 
effects of alendronate would be seen after longer term observations.  
Thus, the CHMP agrees with the Applicant that based on the available evidence thus far, that a consistent 
cardioprotective effect of alendronate has not been demonstrated. 
Genetic Conditions with Absent or Reduced Sclerostin 
Patients with sclerosteosis or van Buchem disease, or those heterozygous for the SOST mutations (resulting 
in total loss or reduction in sclerostin), can serve as a model of what may be expected in subjects treated 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 166/263 
  
  
 
 
with a sclerostin inhibitor such as romosozumab. A literature review did not identify any association of 
increased risk or notable trend in cardiovascular disease in patients who suffer from sclerosteosis or van 
Buchem disease and have significantly reduced or absent sclerostin activity. In addition, genome-wide 
association studies have failed to identify genetic associations between the SOST gene and cardiovascular 
risk. 
Summary of Epidemiology of Serious Cardiovascular Events 
Overall, the incidence rates of positively-adjudicated cardiovascular serious adverse events reported among 
subjects in the 3 phase 3 studies (Studies 20070337, 20110142, and 20110174), including subjects receiving 
romosozumab, appear to be similar to or lower than those reported from population-based studies of the 
general population and of patients with osteoporosis. Specifically, incidence rates of cerebrovascular events 
were lower, and incidence rates of cardiac ischaemic events were comparable, among subjects who received 
romosozumab compared with the general or osteoporotic female populations. For subjects who received 
alendronate, incidence rates of both cerebrovascular and cardiac ischaemic events were lower than the 
incidence rates in the general or osteoporotic female populations. Reported incidence rates from population-
based studies and clinical study data suggest that there is not an excess in the incidence of cardiovascular 
serious adverse events observed among subjects who received romosozumab in the clinical studies compared 
with what might be expected, based on review of epidemiological evidence. 
Direct comparisons of reported incidence rates from population-based studies and clinical study data are 
challenging to make because of numerous confounding factors, including differences in patient characteristics 
such as: age and other clinical risk factors; regional differences; time frame of assessments; cardiovascular 
outcome definitions and ascertainment methodologies; statistical methodology; and being part of a clinical 
study population. 
Burden of disease and unmet need

Fractures may significantly impair the quality of life. However, the DALY estimates presented by the Applicant 
demonstrate that ischaemic heart disease (the important safety concern with romosozumab) outweighs 
clearly other disease groups.

CV risk factors analysis 
Various post hoc subgroup analyses based on CV risk factors (e.g., osteoporosis severity, diabetes, and 
smoking) were conducted and did not identify a subpopulation at consistently increased relative risk of CV 
SAEs with administration of romosozumab.  
Among these subgroup analyses, the CV imbalance was analysed for the subgroup of older osteoporosis 
subjects. There was a slight numerical increase in the HRs for the incidence of MACE-1 in the older age group 
(≥75 years) between treatment arms compared to that from the younger age group (<75 years) in 
20070337 and the meta-analysis, but all p-values for treatment by subgroup interactions were 
nonsignificant. 
When further evaluating the annual incidence rates in 20110142, it was noted that the number of CV events 
was lowest in the first year in the ALN group, with an increase in the rate of these events in this group in 
subsequent years. The risk of CV events increases with age, therefore a tendency to increased rate during 
four years of follow-up would not be unexpected in any cohort. 
In contrast, the rate of CV events for subjects treated with romosozumab was highest during the actual 
treatment year and the year after followed by a decline. This pattern could be expected in a randomized trial 
if romosozumab treatment is associated with CV events. 
Figure 30: Annual incidence of positively adjudicated MACE-1 in Study 20110142 
Finally, in a new subgroup analysis of the 3 pivotal studies, HRs for the positively-adjudicated MACE-1 was 
determined for subjects with or without a prior history of MI or stroke. This analysis indicated that the 
Assessment report

relative risk of a MACE-1 was consistent regardless of prior history of stroke or MI (1.59 [0.62, 4.10] vs. 1.38 
[0.95, 2.02], respectively). As expected, the absolute risk was consistently greater (but with small 
differences) for subjects with a prior history of stroke or MI, regardless of treatment group. Within the 
romosozumab group, 3.7% of subjects with a prior history of stroke or MI had a positively adjudicated MACE-
1 compared with 1.2% of subjects without a prior history of stroke or MI (for control group, 2.2% of subjects 
with a prior history and 0.9% of subjects without a prior history).

Serum Calcium 
Figure 31: Calcium Corrected by Albumin by Visit in Standard and Conventional Units Median and 
Interquartiles (12-month Placebo-Controlled Osteoporosis Safety Analysis Set) 
In Study 20110142, mild and transitory decreases in serum albumin-corrected calcium were observed in both 
the romosozumab and alendronate treatment groups. Mild decreases in phosphorus in both treatment groups 
were also observed throughout the primary analysis period. 
Other (sub) Studies 
Study 20070337 included a calcium substudy comprising 1687 subjects to characterize the subject incidence 
of hypocalcaemia (defined as albumin-corrected serum calcium level < 7.5 mg/dL) associated with the first 
romosozumab 210 mg dose along with daily calcium and vitamin D supplementation. On study day 14, no 
hypocalcaemic values were observed for any subject in either treatment group. 
In Phase 1 Study 20110227, the administration of romosozumab resulted in a greater decrease in serum 
calcium level in subjects with stage 4 and stage 5 CKD than in healthy subjects. (see section “renal 
impairment”) The mean percent change from baseline for albumin-adjusted calcium reached a nadir on day 
15 in healthy subjects (−1.9%). 
Study 20110142 included a substudy in which other parameters (calcium, iPTH, sclerostin, and phosphate) 
were analysed. Serum calcium was evaluated for 151 subjects in the romosozumab/alendronate group and 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020

140 subjects in the alendronate/alendronate group who participated in the BTM substudy. There was a 
decrease in corrected serum calcium levels at months 1 and 3; the median percent change from baseline was 
-2.8% and -2.5%, respectively, for subjects who received romosozumab and -1.7% and -1.0% for subjects 
who received alendronate. 
Phosphorus 
Because romosozumab increases bone formation, there is an increased demand for phosphorus, in addition 
to calcium, to support bone matrix mineralization. Decreases in phosphorus levels with romosozumab 
treatment were observed both in the 12-month placebo-controlled osteoporosis safety analysis set and in the 
male osteoporosis Study 20110174. 
In Study 20110142, at month 1, the median percent change in phosphorus level was -6.4% in the 
romosozumab group and -3.5% in the alendronate group. Phosphorous levels remained below baseline 
through month 30, returning to near baseline levels by month 36 (median percent change from baseline was 
-2.9% in the romosozumab/alendronate group and 0.5% in the alendronate/alendronate group). 
Median phosphorous values remained within the normal range. With the exception of month 1, no differences 
in the phosphorus levels between treatment groups were statistically significant.

Serum Intact Parathyroid Hormone and Urinary Calcium 
Because romosozumab increases bone formation, there may be compensatory responses in iPTH as a result 
of calcium demands from bone matrix mineralization. In the Phase 1 Study 20110227, the administration of 
romosozumab resulted in a greater increase in iPTH in subjects with stage 4 and stage 5 CKD than in healthy 
subjects 
Study 20070337 
Study 20070337 included an iPTH and urinary calcium substudy comprising 656 subjects to characterize 
serum iPTH concentration and urinary calcium excretion through month 12. The median percentage change 
from baseline in iPTH was 29% in the romosozumab group and 4% in the placebo group at month 6 and 27% 
in the romosozumab group and 8% in the placebo group at month 12. Differences between romosozumab 
and placebo were statistically significant at both time-points (nominal p-value < 0.001 from Wilcoxon rank-
sum test without multiplicity adjustment). 
Corresponding median percentage change from baseline in estimated 24-hour urinary calcium excretion 
values were −16.8% in the romosozumab group and 3.0% in the placebo group at month 6, and −15.9% in 
the romosozumab group and −7.6% in the placebo group at month 12. Differences between romosozumab 
and placebo for urinary calcium excretion were statistically significant at 6 months (nominal p-value < 0.001

from Wilcoxon rank-sum test without multiplicity adjustment) but not at 12 months (nominal p-value = 0.10 
from Wilcoxon rank-sum test without multiplicity adjustment). 
Study 20110142 
In the BTM and biomarker substudy of Study 20110142, iPTH was analyzed for 67 subjects in the 
romosozumab/alendronate group and 64 subjects in the alendronate/alendronate group. At baseline, the 
median iPTH value was 4.83 pmol/L (45.60 pg/mL) in the romosozumab group and 4.80 pmol/L (45.25 
pg/mL) in the alendronate group. Beginning with month 1, the median iPTH values increased (7.52 pmol/L 
and 6.37 pmol/L, respectively). The median percent change in iPTH at month 1 was 60.1% in the 
romosozumab group and 34.7% in the alendronate group, which was statistically significant (nominal p-value 
< 0.006 using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test). The median iPTH values were statistically significantly higher in 
the romosozumab through month 6. 
Study 20110174 
The levels of iPTH increased at month 6; the median percent change from baseline was 39.4% for subjects 
who received romosozumab and 3.6% for subjects who received placebo. Levels of iPTH decreased from 
month 6 to month 12 for subjects in the romosozumab group, such that the median percent change from 
baseline at month 12 was 18.7% for the romosozumab group and 5.7% for the placebo group. 
In patients with end-stage renal disease, previous publications have described a relationship among 
increased PTH levels and cardiovascular risk (Block et al, 2004; Floege et al, 2011). In the romosozumab 
clinical development program, PTH levels were only collected in a subset of subjects who experienced very 
few cardiovascular events. Given the lack of convincing evidence in non-chronic kidney disease patients to 
suggest that there is a relationship between PTH levels and cardiovascular events it seems not likely that an 
analysis of PTH levels/changes and cardiovascular events could be contributory to the understanding of the 
cardiovascular results in the romosozumab clinical program. 
Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
Absolute values and changes from baseline in vital signs were provided in individual study reports and were 
not integrated. Analysis of vital signs (mean values of systolic and diastolic blood pressures, pulse rate, body 
temperature, body weight, and BMI) in individual studies demonstrated no clinically important effect of 
romosozumab. 
There is a low likelihood for delayed cardiac repolarization due to human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) 
channel blockade with romosozumab, primarily based on its physical size of approximately 150 kD and the 
low potential for large protein therapeutics (especially monoclonal antibodies) to interfere with cardiac ion 
channels in vivo, including hERG-mediated current (Vargas et al, 2008). There were no romosozumab-related 
electrocardiographic changes in conscious telemetry-instrumented cynomolgus monkeys following single IV 
doses up to 300 mg/kg followed by 14 days of monitoring. Area under the concentration-time curve and 
maximum serum concentration (Cmax) exposure margins achieved were up to 32-fold and 210-fold, 
respectively, to clinical exposures at 210 mg QM. There were no romosozumab-related electrocardiographic 
or blood pressure changes in the 1-month and 6-month repeat-dose toxicology studies in monkeys at doses 
up to 300 mg/kg IV. 
ECGs were not done in pivotal phase 3 studies. Analysis of ECG results in individual studies in which they 
were analysed demonstrated no clinically important effect of romosozumab.

In study 20060326, ECG was collected at baseline and during Romosozumab treatment at month 1, 3, 9 and 
12. No subject had QTcF > 500 msec. Two subjects (140 mg QM and 140 mg Q3M) had QTcF between 480 
and 500 msec at the month 3 visit, 2 subjects (210 mg QM and 210 mg Q3M) had QTcF between 480 and 
500 msec at the month 9 visit, 1 subject (70 mg QM) had QTcF between 480 and 500 msec at the month 12 
visit. Three subjects in the combined romosozumab group had Bazett’s corrected QTc (QTcB) > 500 msec (1 
subject in the 210 mg QM group at month 9 and 2 subjects in the 70 mg QM group at month 12) None of 
these subjects had adverse events of cardiac arrhythmia, hypocalcaemia, hypokalaemia, or 
hypomagnesemia, and all of these subjects had a cardiac history that could potentially account for these 
findings. 
The clinical data in Studies 20070337, 20110142, and 20110174 did not indicate any relevant changes in 
mean blood pressure and heart rate. Mean values were comparable between treatment arms at baseline and 
throughout each of the studies. In Studies 20070337 and 20110142, the number of subjects with positively-
adjudicated serious cardiovascular events during the 12-month double-blind period, and systolic blood 
pressure ≥ 160 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure ≥ 100 mmHg, was generally comparable between 
treatment groups or was fewer in the romosozumab group.  
Safety in special populations 
Renal impairment 
Based on the totality of the data, dose adjustment for patients with RI is not proposed by the Applicant. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events by baseline eGFR rate and preferred term are provided for the 12-
month placebo-controlled osteoporosis safety analysis set for Studies 20060326 and 20070337. No safety 
analyses were performed for subgroups by RI in Study 20110142 or in the male osteoporosis Study 
20110174.

In the osteoporosis safety analysis set, adverse events were assessed based on baseline eGFR categories of 
15 to < 30, 30 to < 60, 60 to < 90, and ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 (no subject had an eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73 
m2 at baseline. The exposure adjusted incidence rate per 100 subject-years of adverse events for the total 
romosozumab group was 365.9 for subjects with eGFR ≥ 15 to < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 (vs 1371.8 for 
placebo); 202.2 for subjects with eGFR ≥ 30 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. (vs 233.7 for placebo); 201.6 for 
subjects with ≥ 60 to < 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 (vs 217.6 for placebo); and 243.3 for subjects with eGFR ≥ 90 
mL/min/1.73 m2 (vs 215.6 for placebo). 
Numerical differences were noted but are likely because of the small number of subjects in some subgroups, 
for example 14 subjects in the romosozumab group and 8 subjects in the placebo group for subjects with 
eGFR ≥ 15 to < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. 
Phase 1 Study 20110227 
Phase 1 Study 20110227 was conducted in 24 subjects (8 healthy subjects and 8 subjects each with stage 4 
RI or stage 5 CKD requiring haemodialysis) to investigate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and 
safety of romosozumab in subjects with RI. Romosozumab was administered at single doses of 210 mg.  
The most common adverse events were hypocalcaemia (5 subjects [1 subject with stage 4 RI, 4 subjects 
with stage 5 CKD requiring haemodialysis]) and secondary hyperparathyroidism (4 subjects [4 subjects with 
stage 4 RI]); all of these events were CTCAE ≤ grade 2 except 1 subject with stage 5 CKD requiring 
haemodialysis who had a grade 3 non-serious adverse event of asymptomatic hypocalcaemia reported on 2 
separate occasions. The administration of romosozumab resulted in a greater decrease in serum calcium level 
and a greater compensatory physiological increase in iPTH in subjects with stage 4 RI and stage 5 CKD 
requiring haemodialysis than in healthy subjects. 
The mean percent change from baseline for albumin-adjusted calcium reached a nadir on day 15 in healthy 
subjects (−1.9%) and by day 22 for subjects with stage 4 RI (−4.8%) and subjects with stage 5 CKD 
requiring haemodialysis (−12.9%). The albumin-adjusted calcium levels then returned toward baseline 
levels. 
Hepatic Impairment  
Monoclonal antibodies are not eliminated via hepatic metabolic mechanisms; therefore, no studies have been 
conducted in subjects with hepatic impairment. 
Elderly 
A subgroup analysis of adverse events by age groups (< 65 years, ≥ 65 years to 74 years; ≥ 75 years to 84 
years; and ≥ 85 years) using the 12-month placebo-controlled osteoporosis safety analysis set was provided 
as well as adverse events by age (< 75 years, ≥ 75 years) in Study 20110142. 
Table 69: Treatment-emergent Adverse Events by Age Group Category (<65, 65-74, 75-84 and ≥ 
85 Years) and Preferred Term (12-month Placebo-Controlled Osteoporosis Safety Analysis Set)

Overall, there were no notably different trends between romosozumab or placebo/control treatment groups in 
the incidence of TEAEs by these four age categories. Observed increases with romosozumab versus 
placebo/control tended to be small, not always consistent across age categories, and often associated with 
higher incidences in corresponding placebo/control groups. A small number of subjects in some AE 
categories, especially in the ≥85 years age group, limited the interpretation of these data. 
Geographic Region 
Subjects in Western Europe and Australia/New Zealand had the highest incidence of adverse events (88.1% 
romosozumab, 89.3% placebo), followed by North America (84.9%, 81.4%), Asia Pacific (83.6%, 80.6%), 
Central/Latin America (76.2%, 77.7%), and Central and Eastern Europe (73.7%, 78.2%). Despite regional 
differences in the incidence of individual adverse events, the incidence of individual adverse events was 
similar between treatment groups within a region (≤ 5% difference for nearly all adverse events and 
regions). 
Race 
In summary no meaningful influence of race on romosozumab associated risk could be noted. The only 
uncertainty pertains to the high incidence of osteoarthritis in the Japanese dose finding study that was not 
found in any other subgroup. This is however not of primary interest regarding the European population. 
Body Mass Index 
In general, adverse events by preferred term were reported with similar frequency in the romosozumab and 
placebo groups within each BMI subgroup, and these incidences were similar to those seen in the overall 
population. However, regarding the overall number of subjects reporting adverse events it is noted that 
patients in the “slimmest” group (BMI ≤ 22.5 kg/m2) are the only group exhibiting a higher overall incidence 
as placebo. The difference is however minimal and does not give rise to concern.  
Immunological events 
Immunogenicity in Clinical Studies with Romosozumab 
In phase 2 and phase 3 clinical studies of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, the incidence of 
developing anti-romosozumab antibodies was 18.6% (1162 of 6244) across all doses studied. The safety 
profiles of the subjects who tested positive for binding antibodies were evaluated. The safety profiles 
assessed included adverse events potentially related to hypersensitivity, injection site reaction or 
autoimmune disorder related symptoms in subjects who tested positive for binding and neutralizing ADA in 
the PMO safety analysis set. Anti-romosozumab antibodies were not tested in subjects randomized to 
placebo. 
The incidence of hypersensitivity events in the romosozumab dosed groups were comparable between 
subjects who were positive for anti-romosozumab binding and neutralizing antibodies (7.5% and 5.4%) and 
for those subjects who were negative for anti-romosozumab binding antibodies (7.8% and 7.6%); and in the 
placebo group (7.6%). 
The incidence of autoimmune related disorders in the romosozumab dosed groups were comparable between 
subjects who were positive for anti-romosozumab binding and neutralizing antibodies (0.7% and 0.0%) and 
for those subjects who were negative for anti-romosozumab binding antibodies (0.8% and 0.7%); and in the 
placebo group (0.9%). Adverse events potentially related to autoimmune disorders were generally similar for 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 176/263 
  
  
subjects who received romosozumab, regardless of binding or neutralizing ADA status, as well as for subjects 
who received placebo. 
The site reactions were more common in the romosozumab dosed subjects (8.2%) than placebo dosed 
groups (3.1%) but no association of anti-romosozumab binding (8.3%) and neutralizing antibodies (15.7%) 
was noted with the date of onset of the injection site reaction when compared to antibody negative subjects 
(6.2% and 7.7%) for the romosozumab dosed groups 
Additionally, the treatment- emergent hypersensitivity events, injection site reactions, and autoimmune 
disorders were assessed the 210mg QM romosozumab dosed and placebo groups and found to be comparable 
between subjects who were positive for anti-romosozumab binding and neutralizing antibodies and negative 
for anti-romosozumab binding antibodies. 
In Study 20110174, the number of subjects reporting treatment-emergent adverse events was 9.9% for 
placebo (8/81), 10.0% for antibody negative (13/130), 12.5% for binding antibody positive (4/32), and 0% 
for neutralizing antibodies (0/1).  
In Study 20110142, the number of subjects reporting treatment-emergent adverse events was 9.7% for 
alendronate (195/2014), 10.6% for antibody negative (174/1639), 9.5% for binding antibody positive 
(30/316), and 8.3% for neutralizing antibodies (1/12). 
These data indicate no effect of anti-romosozumab antibodies on the safety of romosozumab.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No studies on potential drug-drug interactions were conducted with romosozumab due to the fact that no PK 
drug-drug interactions are expected with romosozumab administration. Romosozumab is a monoclonal 
antibody that binds specifically to sclerostin, and there are no known mechanisms or previous PK or 
pharmacodynamics experience whereby romosozumab may precipitate PK drug-drug interactions.  
Discontinuation due to AES 
The overall number of discontinuations was balanced between romosozumab and integrated control groups. 
There were no marked differences in reasons for discontinuations in the preferred term level and no preferred 
term was reported by more than 5 subjects in any treatment group.  
In the 12-month placebo-controlled osteoporosis population, adverse events leading to discontinuation from 
the study were reported for 46 (1.2%) subjects in the total romosozumab group and 50 (1.4%) of subjects in 
the placebo group. During the 12-month double-blind treatment period of the alendronate-controlled Study 
20110142, adverse events led to withdrawal from the study for 30 (1.5%) subjects who received 
romosozumab and 27 (1.3%) subjects who received alendronate. 
Longer-term Follow-up 
Study 20070337 
This study included a 12-month treatment phase, during which subjects received romosozumab or placebo. 
This was followed by a 12-month open-label denosumab follow-up period, and a 12-month open-label 
denosumab extension period through month 36.

Study 20060326 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1:1:1:1:1:1:1 ratio to receive 1 of 5 double-blind dosing regimens of 
romosozumab or placebo for 24 months (or open-label alendronate (ALN) or open-label teriparatide for the 
first 12 months). This 24-month treatment phase was followed by re-randomization to a 12-month extension 
phase with denosumab or placebo; followed by a 12-month retreatment phase with romosozumab 210 mg 
QM, followed by a 24-month open-label follow-on phase with no intervention or zoledronic acid.  
The overall percentage of subjects with adverse events up to month 24 was similar in the total romosozumab 
group (96.1%) and the total placebo group (96.0%). There was no dose-dependent trend seen in the overall 
incidence of adverse events across the romosozumab groups (92% to 100%). 
Table 74: Summary of Subject Incidence of Adverse Events (Safety Analysis Set) (Events Started 
After Month 24 Visit Are Excluded) (20060326 Month 24 Interim Analysis) 
Up to 24 months, adverse events occurring more frequently across the combined romosozumab groups 
compared with placebo (≥ 5 percentage points difference) and occurring in ≥ 10% of subjects in the total 
romosozumab group included nasopharyngitis (29.4% romosozumab, 24.0% placebo), pain in extremity 
(14.5%, 8.0%), and urinary tract infection (11.0%, 6.0%). Injection site pain occurred more frequently in 
the total romosozumab group (7.8%) than in the placebo group (0.0%). 
In study 20060326, a total of 255 patients received romosozumab at different doses for 24 months. No dose-
dependent trend was seen in the overall incidence of adverse events across the romosozumab groups and the 
overall incidence of AE:s seemed comparable with the incidences seen in the 12-month osteoporosis set. 
However, this study was considerably smaller. The proposed dosing regimen is 210 mg for 12 months. 
Study 20060326 is the only data source for both off-treatment and re-exposure to romosozumab. At months 
36 to 48, a total of 167 subjects received re-treatment with romosozumab. One serious MI occurred in the 
study during re-treatments period. Due to the limited number of patients receiving re-treatment, no firm 
conclusions on safety of re-treatment can be made.

Other safety results of interest 
Study 20080289 (Transition from Bisphosphonate Therapy) 
Study 20080289 was a multicentre, randomized, open-label, 12-month teriparatide-controlled study in 436 
postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (safety analysis set of 432 subjects) who were transitioning from 
bisphosphonate therapy.  
The percentages of subjects reporting adverse events were (148 of 214 subjects [69.2%]) for the 
teriparatide group and (164 of 218 subjects [75.2%]) for the romosozumab group.  Injection site reactions 
were observed more frequently with romosozumab (7.8%) compared with teriparatide (2.8%), which led to 
study drug discontinuation for 1 subject in the romosozumab group. Hypercalcaemia was reported more 
frequently with teriparatide (10.3%) compared to romosozumab (0.9%).  
Numerically, there were more AEs of nervous system disorders (20 vs 14%), cardiac disorders (5.0 vs 3.7%) 
and vascular disorders (7.3 vs 3.3%) in the romosozumab group. 
Serious cardiac disorders were reported in 2.3% for Romosozumab and 0.9% for teriparatide. One serious 
cerebrovascular accident, one ischaemic stroke and one transient ischaemic attack were reported in the 
Romosozumab group vs none in the teriparatide group. CV events were not adjudicated in this study. 
Study 20120156 (70 mg/mL and 90 mg/mL Formulations) 
Study 20120156 was a phase 3, multicentre, randomized, multiple dose study to evaluate the non-inferiority 
of romosozumab at a 90 mg/mL concentration (proposed for commercial use) compared with a 70 mg/mL 
concentration (used in other phase 3 studies) in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. 
All 294 randomized subjects received ≥ 1 dose of investigational product with a median number of 6 doses in 
all 3 treatment groups. At months 6 and 9, the incidence of adverse events and serious adverse events was 
comparable among the 3 treatment groups (placebo, romosozumab 90 mg/mL, and romosozumab 70 
mg/mL). 
Table 75: Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events of Potentially Related to Hypersensitivity by 
Preferred Term (Safety Analysis Set) (20120156 Final Analysis) 
The overall incidence of anti-romosozumab binding antibodies had similar incidence between the 
concentration groups. 
In this relatively small study 20120156, hypersensitivity reactions were more common in the romosozumab 
90 mg/mL (proposed for commercial use) group (11.4%) compared with the romosozumab 70 mg/mL (used 
in other phase 3 studies) group (2.5%). 2 subjects with injection site hypersensitivity and 1 subject with 
erythema withdrew from investigational product due to these events; there were no hypersensitivity related 
withdrawals in the other groups. 
The reported incidence of hypersensitivity reactions in 90 mg/mL group in study 20120156 was also higher 
than for romosozumab in the 12-Month placebo-controlled osteoporosis safety analysis set (257 cases, 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 182/263 
  
  
 
6.7%). The rationale for development of 90mg/mL formulation for patient convenience is acknowledged. 
However, overall, the clinical experience of 90mg/mL formulation is at this time point very limited with only 
123 patients exposed for 6 months.  
Hypersensitivity is an identified risk for Romosozumab. The current safety data showed no anaphylactic 
reactions that were attributable to romosozumab 90mg/mL or 70mg/mL concentrations. Any new serious 
events related to hypersensitivity should be followed post-marketing.  
Device-related Adverse Event Data 
Device-related adverse events were collected in 5 phase 1 studies; other clinical studies did not collect 
relationship of adverse events to device on the adverse event case report form. The 5 phase 1 studies 
comprised 539 subjects who received romosozumab using 1 of 3 drug product presentations: 
* a glass prefilled syringe (PFS) containing 70 mg/mL of romosozumab 
* a resin PFS containing 90 mg/mL of romosozumab (the planned commercial product) 
* an autoinjector containing 90 mg/mL of romosozumab 
All 5 studies were single-dose studies. The planned commercial product was presented in a single-use resin 
PFS and prefilled autoinjector/pen containing 90 mg/mL romosozumab with a 1.17 mL deliverable volume. 
Administration was to be performed by an individual trained in injection technique. Subjects administered the 
210 mg dose by resin PFS received a total of 2 injections per dose and subjects administered the dose using 
a glass PFS received a total of 3 injections per dose. The majority of subjects who participated in studies in 
which device-related adverse events were collected received the drug product planned for commercial use. A 
total of 121 subjects received 363 injections of romosozumab using the glass PFS and 344 subjects received 
688 injections of romosozumab using the resin PFS. The remaining 74 subjects received romosozumab via 
autoinjector/pen. 
Somewhat higher incidence of device-related adverse events (almost all injection site reactions) occurred in 
the 90 mg/mL group vs the 70 mg/mL group.

2.6.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety data were submitted from an extensive safety database that includes 11553 subjects in 19 
romosozumab clinical studies who received at least 1 dose of romosozumab (n = 7681) or placebo (n = 
3872). Additionally, the integrated control group for the osteoporosis safety analysis set includes 6155 
subjects who received placebo, alendronate, teriparatide, and/or denosumab. In contrast, the number of 
male subjects with osteoporosis, who received romosozumab (n=163), is very limited. 
The total number of adverse events was generally comparable in the clinical studies between romosozumab 
and control groups in pooled datasets. The number of treatment related AEs was somewhat higher in the 
romosozumab group. The most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis, headache, cough, arthralgia, 
dyspepsia and peripheral oedema and muscle spasms with no striking differences between treatment groups. 
Injection site pain and cataracts seem to be more common in the romosozumab group. Of these, 
nasopharyngitis (13.6% vs 12.6%), arthralgia (12.4% vs 11.8%), headache (6.5% vs 5.9%), muscle spasms 
(4.4% vs 3.9%), neck pain (2.1% vs 1.5%), cataract (2.0% vs 1.5%), injection site pain (1.8% vs 1.2%), 
injection site erythema (1.5% vs 0.2%), sinusitis (1.4% vs 0.8%), and injection site pruritus (0.7% vs 0.2%) 
were proposed to be labelled in the SmPC with a frequency “common” or “very common”. The total number 
of serious adverse events was somewhat higher for romosozumab compared to placebo but somewhat lower 
compared to alendronate in study 20110142.  
In the pooled pivotal trials, there was a numerical imbalance in fatal events with HR 1.20 and 1.37 in the two 
large PMO studies. In study 20070337 patients 75 years of age and older had a significantly increased risk of 
death in general in the romosozumab arm as compared to alendronate (19 vs 8 cases; HR 2.4 [95%CI 1.03-
5.40]). This difference in patients 75 years and older vs control (alendronate or placebo) was also observed 
in the safety analysis set of all pivotal trials (20070337,20110142,20110174) (46 vs. 26 cases, HR 1.71 
[95%CI 1.06,2.78]).The imbalance was mainly due to fatal cardiovascular events and neoplasms. Baseline 
co-morbidities/risk factors between treatment groups within each age subgroup, were not consistently 
favouring control or romosozumab groups. It was also not possible to identify age specific other risk factors 
for fatal events that would be specific for the romosozumab group. There are numerous variables that can 
play a role in the fatal outcome of an event and the causality to romosozumab is not possible to determine in 
individual cases. However, an osteoporosis drug that reduces fractures in older population would be expected 
to possibly reduce all-cause mortality, not the opposite.  
Based on the mechanism of action, class effects of bone-forming agents and CHMP feedback, adverse events 
of interest for romosozumab included hypocalcaemia, hypersensitivity, injection site reactions, malignancies, 
hyperostosis, osteoarthritis, atypical femoral fractures and osteonecrosis of the jaw. Independent 
adjudication of serious cardiovascular events was pre-specified in the 3 pivotal phase 3 studies. 
Cardiovascular events 
During the development program, an imbalance in positively-adjudicated cardiovascular serious adverse 
events was observed between romosozumab (2.5%) and alendronate (1.9%) in Study 20110142. This 
imbalance was due specifically to serious cardiac ischemic (0.8% vs 0.3%) and serious cerebrovascular 
(0.8% vs 0.3%) events. Death, serious MI or serious stroke (MACE) occurred in 53/2040 (2.6%) patients 
treated with romosozumab compared to 32/2014 (1.6%) patients treated with alendronate, HR 1.7 (95%CI 
1.1-2.6). An imbalance in major adverse CV events noted in study 20110142 12-month double blinded 
treatment period persisted at least through month 24 in the follow-up period.  
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 184/263 
  
  
Among these subgroup analyses, the CV imbalance was analysed for the subgroup of older osteoporosis 
subjects. There was a slight numerical increase in the HRs for the incidence of MACE-1 in the older age group 
(≥75 years) between treatment arms compared to that from the younger age group (<75 years), but all p-
values for treatment by subgroup interactions were nonsignificant. 
These findings were not apparent in the larger, placebo-controlled study (Study 20070337); MACE HR 1.1 
(95%CI 0.7-1.7). In the smaller placebo-controlled male osteoporosis study, the imbalance in positively-
adjudicated cardiovascular events was again observed between treatment groups, MACE HR 1.6 (95%CI 0.3-
7.7) despite the fact that the prevalence of diabetes and smoking was higher in the placebo treatment arm. 
However, number of subjects in this male study was limited resulting in broad CIs.  
Numerical imbalance in cardiovascular events was also noted in Study 20080289 compared to teriparatide in 
subjects who transitioned from bisphosphonate therapy (safety analysis set of 432 subjects). Serious cardiac 
disorders were reported in 2.3% for romosozumab and 0.9% for teriparatide.  
The divergent findings regarding CV events in the two large pivotal studies were of concern. There was no 
bias in baseline characteristics within each randomized 3 clinical studies. However, the populations in each 
study were quite different: Subjects enrolled in Study 20110142 were on average 4 years older than in Study 
20070337 and had a more severe osteoporosis defined by the entry criteria. Other differences among the 
studies included a somewhat higher rate of history of hypertension and cardiovascular disease in Study 
20110142 compared with the other 2 studies. Men are known to have an increased CV risk compared to 
women. While many CV events occurred also in study 20070337, the incidence in the placebo group was 
lower than in the studies showing imbalance in CV events. 
Adjudication process could reduce the number of events in studies and lead to possibly false low incidences of 
these events (but similarly in both treatment and comparator groups). For example, in study 20070337, a 
total of 342 cardiac disorders were reported but only 86 were reported as serious and were sent for 
adjudication. In addition, events sent to adjudication could fail adjudication (204 SAEs out of 524 in total) 
due to missing information only.   
Osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease have overlapping risk factors and are associated conditions in 
epidemiological studies. The discrepancy seen between the studies in the risk of positively-adjudicated 
cardiovascular serious adverse events might be explained by a combination of factors that are associated 
with osteoporosis severity and cardiovascular risk but numerically difficult to capture in a detailed review of 
small differences in medical history, baseline cardiovascular-related medications, general medical history and 
in an exploration of the potential impact of age alone and other cardiovascular risk factors separately. Studies 
20110142 and Study 20070337 had different inclusion/exclusion criteria regarding osteoporosis severity (T-
scores and fractures). Only 14% of all included patients in these two pivotal PMO studies had overlapping 
inclusion criteria. Consequently, these two pivotal studies represent largely different osteoporosis 
populations. The patients in study 20110142 were older and had a more severe osteoporosis disease. A 
discrepancy in some safety results, such as treatment emergent MI and stoke events, between studies is thus 
not totally unexpected.   
When further evaluating the annual incidence rates in study 20110142, it was noted that the number of CV 
events was lowest in the first year in the ALN group, with an increase in the rate of these events in this group 
in subsequent years. The risk of CV events increases with age, therefore a tendency to increased rate during 
four years of follow-up would not be unexpected in any cohort. In contrast, the rate of CV events for subjects 
treated with romosozumab was highest during the actual treatment year and the year after followed by a 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 185/263 
  
  
decline. This pattern could be expected in a randomized trial if romosozumab treatment is associated with CV 
events. 
One explanation for the difference between the 2 studies that was explored was that alendronate would be 
protective against cardiovascular events in humans. However, based on the available evidence thus far, a 
consistent cardioprotective effect of alendronate has not been demonstrated. Direct comparisons of reported 
incidence rates from population-based studies and clinical study data are challenging to make because of 
numerous confounding factors, including differences in patient characteristics such as: age and other clinical 
risk factors; regional differences; time frame of assessments; cardiovascular outcome definitions and 
ascertainment methodologies; statistical methodology; and being part of a clinical study population.  
In response to the concerns of the CHMP, the Applicant has explored the cardiovascular risk profile of 
romosozumab in a new proposed target population with a larger need for osteoporosis treatment and a 
relatively lower risk for cardiovascular events than the broad study population, i.e. subjects with severe 
osteoporosis and with no history of MI or stroke. Approximately 40% of the subjects in Study 20070337 and 
the entire population in Study 20110142 are considered to have severe osteoporosis.  
By excluding subjects with a history of MI/stroke from the post-fracture population in studies 20070337 and 
20110142 when calculating event rates, the excess MACE/1,000 patients in the romosozumab versus control 
arm decreased from 23 excess events to 3. The corresponding number in a population without established 
cardiovascular disease (CVD) was 2 excess MACE/1,000 patients. Such reductions of the absolute risk for 
MI/stroke are expected, as subjects with previous MI/stroke are at high risk for subsequent cardiovascular 
events. The calculated absolute risk difference of MACE is small in the revised proposed target population 
that would have been included according to the restricted indication (severe osteoporosis in postmenopausal 
women at high risk of fracture) and contraindications (History of myocardial infarction or stroke) as proposed 
by the applicant during the procedure. However, the relative risk for MACE in romosozumab versus control 
treated subjects is largely unchanged (4.4% vs 2.6% in the population with previous MI/stroke, 1.4% vs 
0.9% in the population without MI/stroke and 0.8% vs 1.2% in the population without established CVD, for 
romosozumab versus control respectively), as described below.

Other events of interest 
Clinically significant hypersensitivity reactions, including angioedema, erythema multiforme, and urticaria 
occurred in the romosozumab group in clinical trials. Hypersensitivity was proposed to be labelled as an 
adverse event for romosozumab, section 4.8 in the SmPC. Also warnings in section 4.4 were proposed and 
endorsed by the CHMP. In study 20120156, hypersensitivity reactions were more common in the 
romosozumab 90 mg/mL (proposed for commercial use) group 11.4% group compared with the 
romosozumab 70 mg/mL (used in other phase 3 studies) group 2.5%. 2 subjects with injection site 
hypersensitivity and 1 subject with erythema withdrew from investigational product due to these events; 
there were no hypersensitivity related withdrawals in the other groups. Romosozumab 70 mg/mL was used in 
pivotal phase 3 studies. However, higher concentration of 90 mg/mL were proposed for commercial use. 
Hypersensitivity reactions were more common with romosozumab 90 mg/mL in study 20120156. A higher 
incidence of device-related adverse events (almost all injection site reactions) occurred in the 90 mg/mL 
group vs the 70 mg/mL group in study 20120156. The rationale for development of 90mg/mL formulation for 
patient convenience is acknowledged. However, overall, the clinical experience of 90mg/mL formulation is at 
this time point very limited with only 123 patients exposed for 6 months. Hypersensitivity is an identified risk 
for Romosozumab. The current safety data showed no anaphylactic reactions that were attributable to 
romosozumab 90mg/mL or 70mg/mL concentrations. Any new serious events related to hypersensitivity 
should be followed post-marketing.  
Concerning malignancies, no case of osteosarcoma (potential signal from rat studies, however occurred 
therein within level of background incidence) was noted. However, due to the typically long time between 
onset of symptoms (bone pain) and diagnosis, this incidence might have been underestimated. Although 
sclerostin expression has been reported in a limited number of soft tissue and bone tumours, there is no 
current evidence that the presence or absence of sclerostin is related to malignant potential.   
Patients with the genetic absence of sclerostin may have neurologic sequelae due to hyperostosis including 
nerve compression and deafness. In an audiology substudy, no significant difference in average change in 
hearing threshold was observed between the romosozumab and placebo groups at month 12. No subjects 
had a markedly increased BMD post-baseline in clinical studies. The overall data do not give strong support 
that hyperostosis would be a potential risk with romosozumab treatment of skeletally mature osteoporosis 
patients.  
Both pivotal PMO studies included a 12-month treatment phase, during which subjects received 
romosozumab or placebo/comparator; followed by an open label treatment phase with 
denosumab/alendronate. Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) and atypical femur fractures (AFF) are 
known AEs associated with longer term exposure of antiresorptive medications. These events occurred in 
romosozumab/denosumab, alendronate/romosozumab and alendronate/alendronate treatment groups but 
not in the placebo/denosumab group that had shortest total exposure of antiresorptive treatment. 
There was a numerical imbalance in serious adverse events of infections in the pivotal placebo-controlled 
studies, even when adjusted for patient years. The imbalance was marginally higher in subgroup of patients 
>75 years and the frequency of these events was overall somewhat higher in these patients, as shown in 
table 5. Pneumonia was the most frequent type of infection; however, when adjusted for patient years, no 
imbalance was evident. There is no clear biologic plausibility for increased risk of especially pneumonia, 
however, some effects on haematology parameters and white blood count has seen both in preclinical and 
clinical studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 187/263 
  
  
Nasopharyngitis and sinusitis are currently the only type of infection that is proposed to be included in the 
Romosozumab SmPC. Serious infection is included in the RMP as an important potential risk and also included 
as an endpoint for any possible further PASS studies of romosozumab. 
A total of 167 subjects received re-treatment with romosozumab in Study 20060326. One serious MI 
occurred in the study during re-treatments period. Due to the limited number of patients, no firm conclusions 
on safety of re-treatment can be made. 
Laboratory findings 
The mechanism of action of romosozumab suggests that administration of romosozumab may be associated 
with decreases in serum calcium as a result of increased bone formation and increased demands for calcium 
for matrix mineralization. Romosozumab administration was associated with transient decreases in serum 
calcium in pivotal PMO Studies 20070337 and Study 20110174. S-calcium was measured at month 1 in these 
studies. However, in phase 1 study, the mean percent change from baseline for albumin-adjusted calcium 
reached a nadir on day 15 in healthy subjects. This means that the lowest S-Ca values may not have been 
captured in the pivotal trials. Only few adverse events of hypocalcaemia were reported as adverse events in 
the clinical studies. However, transient decrease in S-calcium has been observed in patients receiving 
romosozumab. Hypocalcaemia is proposed as an identified risk for romosozumab, and to be included in SmPC 
as a warning in section 4.4 and with a frequency “uncommon” (Defined as albumin adjusted serum calcium 
that was below the lower limit of normal). This risk is further increased in patients with renal impairment, see 
below. Lipids were not collected in the 3 pivotal phase 3 studies. Romosozumab treatment is associated with 
decreases in s-phosphorus. Romosozumab treatment is associated with increase in iPTH and decrease in 
urinary calcium excretion. These changes may be related to the decrease in s-Ca. The changes seem to 
persist throughout the treatment period. 
No limitations in the use of romosozumab are proposed by the applicant, except a warning that these 
patients are at risk of developing hypocalcaemia. It is noted that there were only a few patients with baseline 
GFR 15-30 mL/min/1.73 m2; 14 subjects in the romosozumab group and 8 subjects in the placebo group in 
the entire osteoporosis safety analysis set. A phase 1 Study 20110227 was conducted in 8 healthy subjects 
and 8 subjects each with stage 4 RI or stage 5 CKD requiring haemodialysis. Hypocalcaemia was reported in 
>30% of the subjects with 4 RI or stage 5 CKD after a single dose. The administration of romosozumab 
resulted in a greater decrease in serum calcium level and a greater increase in iPTH in 4RI and 5CDK than in 
healthy subjects. In patients with end-stage renal disease, previous publications have described a 
relationship among increased PTH levels and cardiovascular risk (Block et al, 2004; Floege et al, 2011). It is 
also noted that patients with renal impairment <30 / mL/min/1.73 m2 have an elevated risk for CV events.  
Immunogenicity 
Antidrug antibody formation after romosozumab treatment seems to be a common phenomenon. About 7.9% 
(66 of 832) of subjects developed binding antibodies after at least 1 dose of romosozumab. All ADA positive 
subjects showed a persistent binding response with a positive result at the last time point tested. Neutralizing 
antibodies were detected in 2.1% (18 of 832) of all romosozumab dosed subjects. Not surprisingly, in repeat 
dose settings the incidence of binding antibodies in subjects repeatedly dosed with romosozumab is more 
common than in a single dose setting (pooled 210 mg QM 19.1% (758 of 3959)). Interestingly however is 
the lower incidence of neutralizing antibodies (0.8% (31 of 3959), respectively. In general incidences of 
binding and neutralizing antibodies are very comparable in osteoporosis patients across analysis sets and 
populations. Though limited by low patient numbers, a retreatment phase with romosozumab does not lead 
to a higher immunogenic potential in terms of ADA formation. Also, pre- or interim treatment with 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 188/263 
  
  
denosumab does not seem to be associated with a different ADA formation incidence. The incidence of pre-
existing romosozumab ADA is considered low with a low magnitude of immune response (close to cut off) In 
general neither incidence no magnitude of this finding suggests a clinically meaningful effect. Cross reactivity 
is one potential explanation. 
The applicant investigated adverse events which can reasonably be associated with immunogenicity regarding 
their incidence rates according to binding and neutralizing ADA status, namely injection site reactions, 
hypersensitivity, and autoimmune disorders. The only possible correlation could be identified for positive 
neutralizing antibodies status and the incidence of injection site reactions, at least when looking at exposure 
adjusted data for the PMO: (incidence rate for positive neutralizing antibody status [14.3] negative status 
[7.0] placebo group [3.1]).  
In general, as opposed to binding antibody status, positive neutralizing antibody status more clearly 
increases the overall (exposure adjusted) incidence rate of adverse events (positive 18.1 vs negative 13.9), 
however this could also be associated with the small group size of neutralizing antibody positive patients 
(n=62 vs n=1137 in the negative group). When looking at absolute incidence numbers, no trend is observed 
for either injection site reactions or absolute numbers of AE in the PMO. 
In the male osteoporosis population binding antibody status more clearly affects the incidence of adverse 
events (81.3% positive anti-romosozumab antibody test at any time vs 74% with negative ADA status). 
Trends supporting an influence of immunogenicity on specific AE are also observed for hypersensitivity 
(12.5% binding antibody positive/10.0% of binding antibody negative/9.9% of subjects in the placebo) and 
injection site reaction (9.4% of binding antibody positive, 4.6% binding antibody negative, and 3.7% 
placebo). The influence on safety of neutralizing antibodies could not be assessed due to their rare incidence 
(only one subject remaining at month 15). 
The influence of binding antibodies on safety is potentially larger in male osteoporosis patients than for PMO 
patients, where only neutralizing antibodies exhibit a visible influence on injection site reactions.  
Additional expert consultation 
The CHMP requested an ad hoc expert meeting to obtain the opinion of experts in the field of osteoporosis, 
cardiology as well as geriatrics, and from patient representatives, on various aspects of the efficacy data and 
the issue of increased rate of CV events observed in studies with romosozumab. Questions were addressed to 
the ad hoc expert group. For the corresponding answers please see 2.5.3 “Discussion on clinical 
efficacy”, section “Additional expert consultation” of this report. 
2.6.3.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
An increased risk of cardiovascular serious adverse events associated with the use of romosozumab was 
noted in the clinical programme with an increase in adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events 
(MACE, defined as all-cause death, and positively-adjudicated serious myocardial infarction or serious 
stroke) in the pivotal study 20110142. In this study, MACE occurred in 53/2040 (2.6%) patients treated 
with romosozumab compared to 32/2014 (1.6%) patients treated with alendronate, HR 1.7 (95%CI 1.1-
2.6). In addition, in the smaller placebo-controlled male osteoporosis study, an imbalance in positively-
adjudicated cardiovascular events was observed between treatment groups with a MACE HR of 1.6 (95%CI 
0.3-7.7). These findings were not seen in the larger, placebo-controlled study (Study 20070337); 
adjudicated MACE HR 1.1 (95%CI 0.7-1.7). Therefore, the most important risk of romosozumab is the 
association of its use with serious cardiovascular events.  
In addition, in study 20070337 patients 75 years of age and older had a significantly increased risk of death

in general in the romosozumab arm as compared to placebo (19 vs 8 cases; HR 2.4 [95%CI 1.03-5.40]), 
which was also the case for the pooled safety data.  
In general, in other aspects romosozumab displayed a risk profile that resembles in many respects the risk 
profile of placebo, and hence, the underlying disease.  
2.7.  Risk Management Plan 
The CHMP and PRAC, having considered the data submitted in the application were of the opinion that due to 
the concerns identified with this application, the risk management plan version 0.6 which was submitted in 
response to the 4th joint CHMP/PRAC Day 180 List of Outstanding Issues Assessment Report, cannot be 
agreed at this stage. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that romosozumab has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the 
European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers romosozumab to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. However, in light of the negative 
recommendation, new active substance status is not applicable at this stage.  
2.10.  Product information 
Due to the aforementioned concerns a satisfactory summary of product characteristics, labelling and package 
leaflet cannot be agreed at this stage. 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
However, due to the aforementioned concerns a satisfactory package leaflet cannot be agreed at this stage. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Not applicable.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Osteoporosis is defined as a disease characterised by low bone mass and microarchitectural deterioration of 
bone tissue and a consequent increase in fracture risk. Romosozumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G2 
(IgG2) monoclonal antibody that binds and inhibits sclerostin. Sclerostin is a negative regulator of signalling 
in osteoblast-lineage cells which result in inhibition of osteoblast-mediated bone formation and stimulation of 
osteoclast-mediated bone resorption. Romosozumab increases bone formation due to the activation of bone 
lining cells, increased bone matrix production by osteoblasts, and recruitment of osteoprogenitor cells. 
Additionally, romosozumab treatment changes expression of regulators of osteoclast activity, thereby 
decreasing bone resorption. The aim of the treatment is to prevent fractures. Romosozumab was intended to 
be given as SC monthly injections for 12 months. 
Romosozumab was intended for treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women (PMO) and also in adult 
men at increased risk of fractures.  
However, the male indication was not further pursued during the procedure.  
Furthermore, during the procedure, the applicant also considered to limit the use to treatment of severe 
postmenopausal osteoporosis at high risk of fractures. This was considered as an attempt to enrich the 
intended target population with the more severe forms of osteoporosis, although there may be no universally 
recognized definition to distinguish these populations. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Bisphosphonates and denosumab are the most common antiresorptive medications prescribed for 
osteoporosis treatment. Teriparatide has a mainly anabolic mechanism of action. There is a need for new 
treatment alternatives. In Europe, 22 million women and 5.5 million men were estimated to have 
osteoporosis in 2010 and 3.5 million possibly related fractures were sustained. Most fractures occur at the 
spine, wrist and hip. The vast majority of osteoporotic fractures occur in postmenopausal women and the 
incidence increases markedly with age. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Three studies were considered pivotal in this application:  
20070337: placebo controlled study in less severe PMO (N=7180) 
20110142: alendronate-controlled study in severe PMO (N=4093) 
20110174: placebo controlled bridging study in men with osteoporosis (N=245) 
All these studies included a randomized, double-blind 12 months treatment phase with romosozumab vs 
placebo or alendronate. The PMO studies were followed by an open-label follow-up phase: patients in study 
20070337 received denosumab up to 24 additional months and patients in study 20110142 received 
alendronate for a mean 20 additional months.  
Supportive studies included study 20080289 which was a teriparatide-controlled study in patients with 
previous bisphosphonate use; study 20060326 which was a dose-ranging placebo- and active-controlled 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 191/263 
  
  
study (teriparatide or alendronate) with off-treatment and re-treatment phases; study 20101291 which was 
dose-ranging placebo-controlled study in Japanese women; and Study 20120156, which was a placebo-
controlled non-inferiority study testing romosozumab at different concentrations. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Study 20070337:  
Study 20070337 met its co-primary endpoints as romosozumab reduced the subject incidence of new 
radiological vertebral fractures compared with placebo during the 12-month double-blind period with n = 16 
(0.5%) for romosozumab vs 59 (1.8%) for placebo and through month 24 (0.6% vs 2.5%) after both groups 
transitioned to denosumab, p<0.001 at both time points. 
Romosozumab significantly reduced the risk for clinical fractures (including symptomatic vertebral and non-
vertebral fractures) compared to placebo (1.6% vs 2.5%, adjusted p=0.008) at 12 months, but not at 24 
months after adjustment for multiplicity.  
A lower incidence of non-vertebral fractures in the romosozumab arm was noted at 12 months (1.6% vs 
2.1%) and 24 months, however, the reductions were not statistically significant after adjustment for 
multiplicity. 
An  increase in DXA BMD from baseline was markedly higher in the romosozumab group than in the placebo 
group at month 12 at the lumbar spine (13% vs 0.4%), total hip (6.0% vs 0.3%) and femoral neck (5.5% vs 
0.3%); p<0.001 at all locations. The DXA BMD in the romosozumab treated group continued to increase 
during denosumab treatment, albeit somewhat less than in the placebo/denosumab group. The largest 
increase in BMD in the romosozumab group occurred during the first 6 months. 
Study 20110142:  
Study 20110142 met both of its two primary endpoints as romosozumab followed by alendronate reduced 
subject incidence of new radiological vertebral fractures through month 24 and clinical (includes symptomatic 
vertebral and non-vertebral) fractures trough primary analysis period compared to alendronate only. 
The subject incidence of new radiological vertebral fractures through 12 months was lower in the 
romosozumab group compared to the alendronate group (3.2% vs 5.0%, p=0.008). New vertebral fractures 
through month 24 occurred in 4.1% of patients with romosozumab/alendronate treatment vs 8.0% with 
alendronate/alendronate treatment (p<0.001). 
This study was event-driven and the primary analysis was performed after median follow-up time of 
approximately 32 months. Romosozumab reduced the risk of clinical fractures at the time point of primary 
analysis compared to alendronate (9.7% vs 13.0%, nominal p<0.001) 
A reduction in non-vertebral fractures was not statistically significant at 12 (3.4% vs 4.6%) or at 24 months. 
At the time point of primary analysis, romosozumab/alendronate had reduced non-vertebral fractures 
compared to alendronate alone (8.7% vs 10.6%), multiplicity adjusted p=0.040.  
Romosozumab increased DXA BMD compared with alendronate at the lumbar spine, (14% vs 5.0%), total hip 
(6.2% vs 2.8%) and femoral neck (4.9% vs 1.7%) at 12 months, p<0.001 at all locations. The differences 
remained significant at 24 months.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Despite the study size, the absolute numbers of non-vertebral fractures were moderate resulting in modest 
absolute risk reductions. In study 20070337 at month 12, hip fractures had occurred in 7/3589 (0.2%) 
romosozumab patients vs 13/3591(0.4%) on placebo. In study 20110142 at month 12, hip fractures had 
occurred in 14/2046 (0.7%) romosozumab patients vs 22/2047 (1.1%) on alendronate.  
A by-region subgroup analysis showed lack of efficacy in Central/Latin America (43% of the randomised 
subjects) and North America (2.7%, very few fractures in total). Central/Latin America patients had lower 
than expected fracture rates in the placebo group probably indicative of a lower baseline fracture risk in this 
subpopulation. The marked region differences in baseline FRAX probabilities hamper a straight forward 
interpretation of fracture analysis outcome, in particular for the analyses of non-vertebral and clinical 
fractures. Study 20060326 (N=255) is the only data source for both off-treatment and re-exposure to 
romosozumab and due to limited number of patients in multiple treatment arms, no firm efficacy conclusions 
can be made.   
In addition to a pre-filled syringe, which has been used in the pivotal phase III studies, the applicant also did 
seek  a  marketing  authorization  for  an  auto-injector/pen  for  the  administration  of  romosozumab.  Study 
20090418 was intended to show bioequivalence of the pre-filled syringe and the autoinjector/pen in healthy 
volunteers.  Although  the  Applicant  did  show  that  the  two  devices  were  bioequivalent  for  the  primary  PK 
parameters and similar for PD markers, there were device complaints arising in two subjects after the injection 
with the auto-injector/pen. The use errors occurring in the usability tests could be attributed to participants 
not fully reading the IFU. The PIL and IFU were revised and the results of the readability test were indicative 
of acceptable performance. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The extensive safety database included 11553 subjects in 19 romosozumab clinical studies who received at 
least 1 dose of romosozumab (n = 7681) or placebo (n = 3872). Additionally, the integrated control group 
for the osteoporosis safety analysis set includes 6155 subjects who received placebo, alendronate, 
teriparatide, and/or denosumab. The overall number of discontinuations was balanced between romosozumab 
and integrated control groups. 
The most common adverse events were nasopharyngitis, headache, cough, arthralgia, dyspepsia and 
peripheral oedema with no striking differences between treatment groups. At 12 months, injection site 
reactions (5.2% vs 2.9%), muscle spasms (4.4% vs 3.9%) and neck pain (2.1% vs 1.5%) were more 
common in the romosozumab group vs placebo. Cataracts (2.1% vs 1.6%) were more common in the 
romosozumab group vs control and were included in the proposed SmPC.  
The number of fatal adverse events was 0.8% in the romosozumab group compared to 0.7% in placebo 
group in the 12-month Placebo-Controlled Osteoporosis Safety Analysis Set. In the alendronate-controlled 
study 20110142, the number of fatal adverse events was higher in the romosozumab group with 30 (1.5%) 
compared to alendronate 21 (1.0%). The exposure-adjusted incidence rate of fatal Treatment-emergent 
Adverse Events (in the Osteoporosis Safety Analysis Set) in all studies, including 20110142, was n = 63 (1.0 
per 100 subject-years) in the romosozumab group and 47 (0.8 per 100 subject-years) in the control group. 
The overall numerical imbalance in fatal events was mainly due to fatal cardiac disorders and neoplasms in 
the romosozumab group.  
In study 20070337, patients 75 years of age and older had a significantly increased risk of death in general in 
the romosozumab arm as compared to alendronate (19 vs 8 cases; HR 2.4 [95%CI 1.03-5.40]). This 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 193/263 
  
  
difference in patients 75 years and older vs control (alendronate or placebo) was also observed in the safety 
analysis set of all pivotal trials (20070337,20110142,20110174) (46 vs. 26 cases, HR 1.71 [95%CI 
1.06,2.78]). 
Cardiovascular events  
Independent adjudication of serious cardiovascular events was pre-specified in the 3 pivotal studies. An 
imbalance in positively-adjudicated cardiovascular serious adverse events was observed between 
romosozumab (2.5%) and alendronate (1.9%) in Study 20110142. This imbalance was due specifically to 
serious cardiac ischaemic (0.8% vs 0.3%) and serious cerebrovascular (0.8% vs 0.3%) events. Death, 
serious MI or serious stroke (MACE) occurred in 53/2040 (2.6%) patients treated with romosozumab 
compared to 32/2014 (1.6%) patients treated with alendronate, HR 1.7 (95%CI 1.1-2.6). An imbalance in 
major adverse CV events noted in the 12-month double-blinded treatment period persisted at least through 
month 24 in the follow-up period.  
In the larger, placebo-controlled study (Study 20070337) the adjudicated MACE HR was 1.1 (95%CI 0.7-
1.7).  
In the smaller placebo-controlled male osteoporosis study, a tendency to imbalance in positively-adjudicated 
cardiovascular events was again observed between treatment groups, MACE HR 1.6 (95%CI 0.3-7.7, broad 
CI due to few subjects). Some imbalance in cardiovascular events was also noted at 12 months in study 
20080289, compared to teriparatide in subjects who transitioned from bisphosphonate therapy (safety 
analysis set of 432 subjects). Serious cardiac disorders were reported in 2.3% for romosozumab and 0.9% 
for teriparatide.  
Other events of interest 
A difference over placebo in the incidence of serious infections and infestations was noted in study 20070337 
(romosozumab 1.9% vs. placebo 1.3%). The difference is mainly driven by cases of serious pneumonia 
(romosozumab 0.5% vs. placebo 0.3%), which were in both treatment groups almost exclusively identified in 
the largest trial 20070337 in osteoporotic women. Serious infections are included in the RMP as an important 
potential risk. 
Romosozumab administration was associated with transient decreases in serum calcium. In study 20070337, 
there was a decrease in corrected serum calcium levels. Median change from baseline was -2.2% at month 1 
and -1.0% at month 12, for subjects who received romosozumab vs 0% for subjects who received placebo. 
Only few adverse events of hypocalcaemia (5 subjects, < 0.1%) were reported as adverse events in 
romosozumab-treated patients in pivotal studies. Romosozumab treatment was also associated with 
decreases in s-phosphorus. The median percent change from baseline was -5.1% vs 0% for placebo at month 
1 and -5.4% vs -2.3% at month 12. In the Serum iPTH and Urinary Calcium substudy analysis set of study 
20070337, the median percentage increase from baseline in iPTH was 29% in the romosozumab group and 
4% in the placebo group at month 6, and 27% vs 8% at month 12. The median percent decrease in 
estimated 24-hour urinary calcium excretion was -16.8% in the romosozumab group and 3.0% in the placebo 
group at month 6 and -15.9% vs -7.6% at month 12. These changes may be secondary to the decrease in s-
Ca.  
Total numbers of AEs related to hypersensitivity were balanced between romosozumab and placebo. Serious 
hypersensitivity was, however, more common in romosozumab treated patients vs placebo (0.2% vs 
<0.1%). Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) and atypical femur fractures (AFF) are known AEs associated with 
longer term exposure of antiresorptive medications. Some events occurred in romosozumab/denosumab,

alendronate/romosozumab and alendronate/alendronate treatment groups but not in the placebo/denosumab 
group that had the shortest total exposure of active treatments.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Romosozumab is a first-in-class monoclonal antibody binding to and inhibiting sclerostin. Sclerostin is 
constitutively expressed in the aorta and upregulated in foci of vascular calcification. However, a weight of 
evidence assessment of all available non-clinical data indicates no obvious mechanistic association between 
sclerostin inhibition and vascular calcification or promotion of atherosclerosis, in normal and/or diseased 
tissue. Further non-clinical testing is, thus, not likely to contribute to the overall benefit / risk assessment in 
humans.  
Findings regarding adjudicated CV events in the two large pivotal studies were somewhat divergent. The two 
large pivotal studies 20110142 and 20070337 had different inclusion/exclusion criteria regarding 
osteoporosis severity (T-scores and fractures), with overlapping inclusion criteria in only 14% of the subjects. 
Various post hoc subgroup analyses based on CV risk factors (e.g., osteoporosis severity, diabetes, and 
smoking) were conducted and did not identify a subpopulation at consistently reduced relative risk of CV 
SAEs with administration of romosozumab.  
In response to the concerns of the CHMP, the Applicant has during the procedure investigated the 
cardiovascular risk profile of romosozumab in a new proposed target population with a larger need for 
osteoporosis treatment and a potentially relatively lower risk for cardiovascular events than the broad study 
population, i.e. subjects with severe osteoporosis and with no history of MI or stroke. By excluding subjects 
with a history of MI/stroke from the post-fracture population in studies 20070337 and 20110142, the 
calculated absolute number of CV events in this population in the romosozumab versus control arm would 
decrease. However, the relative risk for MACE in romosozumab versus control treated subjects is still largely 
unchanged. 
Neoplasms were detected in the overall number of deaths in the 12 months placebo controlled osteoporosis 
set where a malignant lung neoplasm was reported (romosozumab: 4 [0.1%] subjects, placebo: 0 subjects) 
and also in the retreatment period of phase 2 study 20060326, where malignancies were reported for 6 
subjects (3.6%), of which 5 were subjects who had received romosozumab during the first 2 years of the 
study. The individual case reports of these four patients reveal strong risk factors for developing the disease, 
such as long term smoking, and COPD that would make a connection of romosozumab in the development of 
the disease unlikely.  
In the entire osteoporosis safety analysis set, there were only a few patients with baseline GFR 15-30 
mL/min/1.73 m2; 14 subjects in the romosozumab group and 8 subjects in the placebo group. A phase 1 
Study 20110227 was conducted in 8 healthy subjects and 8 subjects each with stage 4 RI or stage 5 CKD 
requiring haemodialysis. Hypocalcaemia was reported in >30% of the subjects with CKD stage 4 or 5 after a 
single dose. The administration of romosozumab resulted in a greater decrease in serum calcium level and a 
greater increase in iPTH in subjects with CKD stage 4 or 5 than in healthy subjects.  
During the procedure, after careful assessment of the available data, the CHMP had seriously questioned 
whether the Benefit/Risk of romosozumab for male osteoporosis patients is comparable to the Benefit/Risk of 
female patients. However, as the Applicant chose not to pursue the male indication further before final 
decision, no formal conclusion by the CHMP was stated.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Radiological vertebral fractures are common findings in postmenopausal women but they are frequently 
asymptomatic (in approximately 60%). A typical symptomatic vertebral fracture causes acute pain and 
decreased mobility that may last about one month. BMD is a surrogate marker for osteoporosis severity and 
included in the osteoporosis definition by the WHO criteria. Fractures that require surgery are the most 
severe aspect of osteoporosis. Surgery is sometimes necessary for wrist fractures and other fractures, 
however hip fractures in particular are associated with serious risks, permanent disability and also increased 
mortality.  
Romosozumab is a first-in-class monoclonal antibody. Romosozumab reduced the risk of new radiological 
vertebral fractures at 12 and 24 months compared to placebo and to alendronate in two pivotal studies. 
Romosozumab also reduced the risk of clinical fractures compared to placebo at 12 months and compared to 
alendronate at the time point of primary analysis. Thus, the predefined primary endpoints were met.  
The effect on non-vertebral fractures (secondary endpoint) did not reach statistical significance in the placebo 
controlled study 20070337. In 43.0% of the randomized population (Central/Latin America) no reduction in 
non-vertebral fractures was observed in the romosozumab group after 12 months. Moreover, a significant 
reduction in hip fractures, one of the most severe aspects of osteoporosis, could not be demonstrated even 
after 36 months in study 20070337. In the study performed in patients with severe osteoporosis (study 
20110142), the effect on non-vertebral fractures was superior to alendronate. 
Alendronate is considered as 1st line osteoporosis therapy in many EU countries and has data of reducing the 
risk of vertebral and hip-fractures vs placebo in previous studies. However, there is no direct comparison of 
the effect size with other potent antiresorptive treatments (e.g. denosumab, zoledronic acid) available. 
An increased risk of cardiovascular serious adverse events was noted in the clinical programme with an 
increase in adjudicated MACE events (myocardial infarction, stroke and death) observed in 2 of 3 pivotal 
studies: between romosozumab and alendronate in the pivotal study 20110142 as well as in the smaller 
placebo-controlled male study. In addition, in study 20110142 patients 75 years and older had a significantly 
increased risk of death in general in the romosozumab arm as compared to alendronate.  This significantly 
increased incidence in patients older than 75 was also observed (for romosozumab vs. alendronate or placebo 
as comparator) in the safety analysis set of all pivotal trials (20070337, 20110142, 20110174).  
Patients with severe osteoporosis (included in study 20110142) are generally at higher risk for CV events. 
However, already the osteoporosis population overall has a higher risk of CV events compared to the general 
population. No sub-population has been identified in which there is no increased relative risk of major 
adverse cardiac events (MACE) with romosozumab (even if it is acknowledged that the number of events in 
some sub-groups is low and the data should be interpreted with some caution). The Applicant had proposed a 
contraindication in patients with previous MI or stroke due to their increased baseline risk of CV events. It is 
agreed that patients with a history of MI or stroke are an easily identifiable and homogeneous population and 
at greatest absolute risk of a subsequent event. However, it is questionable if this would reduce the risk to an 
acceptable level considering that the mechanism behind the increased risk is not known and no subgroup 
without an increased risk has been identified. 
The Applicant had proposed several post authorisation safety studies (PASS). These were intended to 
evaluate adherence to the risk minimization measures and the effectiveness of the educational materials 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 200/263 
  
  
intended for implementation in the EU (for both HCPs prescribing romosozumab and patients being 
prescribed romosozumab), and to further characterize the CV risk. The latter PASS, however, was considered 
not likely to obtain further information related to the risk beyond what is available from randomized clinical 
studies.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Taken together, the CHMP considers that the effect of sequential treatment with romosozumab followed by 
antiresorptive therapy appears to be of clinically relevant magnitude for the proposed target population of 
postmenopausal women with severe osteoporosis, but that the increased risk of MACE in the proposed target 
population was of major concern. An increased mortality in patients 75 and older was also concerning. In 
subjects with less severe osteoporosis, where there might be a lower absolute risk of MACE, the efficacy of 
romosozumab was less convincing, e.g., a statistically significant benefit on non-vertebral fractures and hip 
fractures could not be shown. The proposed risk minimisation activities (such as warnings, contraindications) 
were not considered to remove (or satisfactorily limit) this risk, in particular considering that the underlying 
cause and mechanism of action for the increased risk is not known and no subgroup without an increased risk 
has been identified. 
Therefore, the benefits are not considered to outweigh the risks in the considered target populations. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Evenity is negative. 
Divergent positions are appended to this report. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy for Evenity in the treatment of severe 
osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk of fracture, the CHMP considers by majority decision that 
the safety and efficacy of the above mentioned medicinal product is not sufficiently demonstrated, and, 
therefore recommends the refusal of the granting of the marketing authorisation for the above mentioned 
medicinal product. The CHMP considers that: 
Whereas the safety and efficacy of the above mentioned medicinal product is not sufficiently demonstrated: 
• 
The increased risk of MACE in study 20110142 representing the proposed target population of 
postmenopausal women with severe osteoporosis is a major concern. The proposed risk minimisation 
activities (warnings, contraindications) are not considered to satisfactorily reduce the risk considering 
that the mechanism is not known and no subgroup without an increased risk of MACE has been 
identified. In addition, in the pooled safety data set, an increased risk of all cause mortality in 
patients 75 years of age and older was documented. 
• 
The efficacy of Evenity (romosozumab) for the treatment of osteoporosis appears to be of clinically 
relevant magnitude in the proposed target population of postmenopausal women with severe 
osteoporosis. In subjects with less severe osteoporosis, where there might be a lower absolute risk of 
MACE, the efficacy of romosozumab is less convincing, e.g., a statistically significant benefit on non-
vertebral fractures and hip fractures could not be shown.

5.  Re-examination of the CHMP opinion of 27 June 2019 
Following the CHMP conclusion that Evenity was not approvable based on concerns with an increase of 
cardiovascular events and an adverse outcome in elderly in some of the studies and a smaller reduction of 
fracture risk in less severe osteoporosis, the applicant submitted detailed grounds for the re-examination of 
the grounds for refusal. 
Detailed grounds for re-examination submitted by the applicant: 
Introduction 
In their “grounds for re-examination” the applicant brought forward their arguments in support of the 
approval of therapy with romosozumab. The applicant defined a proposed population based on BMD (T< -2.5) 
and a previous fragility fracture, or ‘severe osteoporosis’ according to the WHO definition.  
During the re-examination several letters were submitted to the Agency, which were brought to the attention 
of the CHMP for transparency, advocating the approval of the product. 
5.1.  Grounds for re-examination - Safety 
The grounds for refusal were as follows: 
The increased risk of MACE in study 20110142 representing the proposed target population of 
postmenopausal women with severe osteoporosis is a major concern. The proposed risk 
minimisation activities (warnings, contraindications) are not considered to satisfactorily reduce 
the risk considering that the mechanism is not known and no subgroup without an increased risk 
of MACE has been identified. In addition, in the pooled safety data set, an increased risk of all-
cause mortality in patients 75 years of age and older was documented. 
Imbalance in all-cause mortality in study 20110142 
The Applicant, in their grounds for re-examination, addressed the concerns with the mortality imbalance as 
follows: 
The Applicant concludes that all-cause mortality in this study is driven by the imbalance in MI and stroke: As 
shown in Table 81, in 20070337, a total of 24 placebo subjects (0.7%) vs 29 romosozumab subjects (0.8%) 
had a fatal adverse event (AE), whereas in 20110142 this was 22 ALN subjects (1.1%) vs 30 romosozumab 
subjects (1.5%).  
All fatal AEs in these studies were adjudicated by Duke Clinical Research Institute (DCRI) and were confirmed 
as either CV or non-CV-related deaths according to the Charter. These were further classified according to 
the underlying causes. Deaths which could not be confirmed to be CV related were assumed to be CV in the 
analysis.

who received at least 1 dose of investigational product; QM=every month; QW=every week 
a Of the all-cause deaths (30 events), 29 events were adjudicated by DCRI and categorized as specified in the table. The 
unadjudicated case was Subject 14256004126 who had a fatal femoral neck fracture, which was not considered in the 
categorization.  
The incidence of non-CV deaths in the 12-month Double-Blind Period was generally balanced in both studies 
with the majority of deaths in both studies attributable to malignancies (22 of 43 cases). In 20070337, 
malignancy-related deaths were slightly higher in the romosozumab group (10 [0.3%]) compared to the 
placebo group (4 [0.1%]). Review of these deaths showed that these were primarily driven by lung 
neoplasms. All subjects with malignant lung neoplasms were current or former smokers, the time to onset 
was short (47 to 132 days after first treatment of romosozumab (as presented in the Day 120 Response to 
Questions) and the overall incidence of fatal and nonfatal lung neoplasms was balanced between treatment 
groups. These data support a lack of effect of romosozumab on non-CV mortality compared to either placebo 
or ALN. 
With regards to CV mortality (Table 81, “CV death” + “Undetermined”), in 20070337 was generally balanced 
17 romosozumab-treated subjects (0.5%) and 15 placebo-treated subjects (0.4%) experiencing positively-
adjudicated CV deaths. In 20110142, the incidence of fatal CV events was 17 romosozumab subjects (0.8%) 
compared to 12 ALN subjects (0.6%). Of these, 5 romosozumab subjects compared to 2 ALN subjects were 
fatal MIs or strokes. The incidence of non-MI or non-stroke fatal CV events was balanced (9 romosozumab 
and 8 ALN). 
When reviewed by age groups (Table 82), an imbalance in death specifically in subjects ≥75 years old is 
observed in both 20070337 and 20110142 during the 12-month Double-Blind Period, which was no longer 
apparent in the Overall Study Period. In 20070337 imbalances were driven by the non-CV death category 
(0.0 vs 0.5%), which was driven by 4 malignancy deaths and the Undetermined death category (0.2% in 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 204/263 
  
  
 
placebo vs 0.7% in romosozumab). Similarly, in 20110142 the imbalance in all-cause death was driven by 
the Undetermined (0.3% vs 0.6%) and confirmed CV (0.8% vs 1.3%) death categories. 
The trend in CV vs non-CV deaths in the 2 pivotal studies was generally consistent regardless of age. 
Furthermore, the small number of events limits the ability to draw specific conclusions, particularly when 
those numbers become even smaller when split by age groups. 
In conclusion, the differences in mortality seen at the end of the 12-month Double-Blind Period in 20110142 
is primarily accounted for by a higher number of fatal MI and strokes in romosozumab-treated subjects 
compared to ALN-treated subjects. This aligns with the imbalance seen for the total number of MI and stroke 
(fatal and nonfatal). Importantly, there is no increased risk of mortality beyond that related to the imbalance 
in overall MI and stroke.

Discussion and Conclusion by CHMP: 
The 12-month double blind period was the period during which differences in cardiovascular outcome became 
most evident; in the view of the CHMP, analysis of this time period is appropriate.  
Non-CV deaths were higher with romosozumab than with comparator (24 v 19), with a striking difference in 
death due to malignancy (15 v 7). Based on time to onset, this could be a chance finding as was assumed in 
the original procedure. 
‘Undetermined death’ was assumed to be CV-death. The absolute numbers of subjects and percentages are 
small in these groupings. On the one hand it may be argued that addition of the ‘undetermined’ group masks 
an effect, on the other hand it may be argued that classifying ‘undetermined’ as ‘CV-death’ is a conservative 
approach that may be regarded as acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 205/263 
  
  
Also CV deaths and “undetermined” deaths were higher with romosozumab (16 v 14 and 18 v 13 
respectively). After exclusion of the MI/stroke related cases, mortality still disfavoured romosozumab in both 
trials (20070337: 28 v 21 and 20110142: 25 v 20). 
Subgroup of elderly above 75 years 
The differences in mortality were also apparent in the subgroup of elderly above 75 years and observed in 
both trials. One-year all-cause mortality in elderly (≥75 years) was 19 vs 8 in Study 20070337 and 25 v 17 
in Study 20110142 for Romosozumab vs control, respectively. Although the results point in the same 
direction possibly suggesting a safety signal, it may be accepted that it is difficult to make firm conclusions 
because of the small number of subjects (n=105, less than 1%) affected (either in total or in subgroups). 
The applicant did not address this issue within the re-examination procedure. The pooled safety data set 
referred to in the included subjects in study 174, i.e. men. Analysis was presented and assessed in the initial 
part of the procedure, as shown: 
Figure 32: Subgroup analysis of baseline Characteristics: Time to First Occurrence of Adverse 
Event Leading to death through Month 12 (Safety Analysis Set) (20070337, 20110142, 20110174) 
It is agreed that the meta-analysis that combines results of studies with different designs and that put 
placebo and alendronate as ‘same’ control is not appropriate; therefore the forest plot of figure 32 above is 
considered to be not appropriate. 
More detailed analyses of data from placebo-controlled studies showed the following: 
Of 7628 unique subjects in the 12-month placebo-controlled osteoporosis safety analysis set [studies 174 & 
337 and 2 phase II studies], 57 deaths (0.7% of subjects overall: 0.8% of total romosozumab group and 
0.7% of placebo group) were reported.  
Among subjects who received romosozumab, 31 deaths (0.8% of subjects) were reported; fatal adverse 
events reported for 2 or more subjects in the total romosozumab group included lung neoplasm malignant 
(reported for 4 subjects), cardiorespiratory arrest (reported for 3 subjects), myocardial infarction (reported 
for 2 subjects), and death not otherwise specified (reported for 6 subjects). The 4 subjects with fatal 
malignant lung neoplasm were all current or former smokers, 1 subject had a history of basal cell carcinoma, 
and 1 subject reported a family history of unspecified cancer. 
Among subjects who received placebo, 26 deaths (0.7% of subjects) were reported; fatal adverse events 
reported for 2 or more subjects included myocardial infarction, angina pectoris, and cerebrovascular accident 
(reported for 2 subjects each) and death not otherwise specified (reported for 6 subjects). Treatment-related 
fatal adverse events were reported for 1 subject in each treatment group (deep vein thrombosis in the 
romosozumab group and sudden death [cause unknown] in the placebo group. 
The causes of the deaths were consistent with what is expected for the subject population enrolled in these 
studies.

EMA/26554/2020

Study 20110142 used alendronate as an active control, and thus was not included in the 12-month placebo-
controlled osteoporosis safety analysis set. In this study, in which the average age was more than 3 years 
older than the placebo-controlled population, 
•  30 (1.5%) subjects in the romosozumab group and 21 (1.0%) subjects in the alendronate group had 
fatal adverse events during the double-blind period. Adverse events (preferred terms) resulting in 
death, which occurred in ≥2 subjects in the romosozumab group, were acute myocardial infarction (3 
subjects), cardiac failure (2 subjects), and uro-sepsis (2 subjects).  
•  21 (1.0%) subjects in the alendronate group had fatal adverse events during the 12-month double-
blind treatment period. Preferred terms reported for ≥2 subjects in the alendronate group included 
pneumonia (3 subjects), cerebrovascular accident (2 subjects), death (2 subjects), and sudden death 
(2 subjects).  
Comparison between the romosozumab and alendronate arms is made difficult by the alendronate arm 
having 4 subjects whose cause of death is recorded as ‘death’ or ‘sudden death’ instead of a more definite 
cause such as ‘acute myocardial infarction’ as in the romosozumab arm. 
For a discussion on the caveats with subgroup analyses, reference is made to publications of Altman and 
colleagues (Analysis by categorizing or dichotomizing continuous variables is inadvisable: an example from 
the natural history of unruptured aneurysms. Naggara O, Raymond J, Guilbert F, Roy D, Weill A, Altman DG. 
AJNR Am J Neuroradiol. 2011 Mar;32(3):437-40; The problem of subgroup analyses: an example from a trial 
on ruptured intracranial aneurysms. Naggara O, Raymond J, Guilbert F, Altman DG. AJNR Am J Neuroradiol. 
2011 Apr;32(4):633-6) and comments further below.  
In the case of ‘death of those >75yrs’, the answer to most questions posed to establish whether or not a 
subgroup effect is present is ‘no’ i.e. it is difficult to claim credibility for the finding of the subgroup analysis. 
A similar approach is also described by Ioannidis & Guyatt and colleagues (in: How to Use a Subgroup 
Analysis. Users’ Guides to the Medical Literature. Sun X et al. JAMA. 2014;311(4):405-411). Similarly, 
following CHMP guidance (EMA/CHMP/539146/2013, Jan 2019), it is concluded that the interpretation of an 
effect in those >75yrs old requires great caution, nonetheless, a signal of risk is described. It could suggest 
that the mortality is related to frailty, which might be difficult to capture in a clinical trial.  
Imbalance in MI and stroke without identified biological mechanism 
To address the CHMP’s concern regarding the increased risk of MACE in 20110142, the Applicant had 
presented in the original MAA during the review an assessment of the data. The Applicant considerd that the 
divergent results in the 2 pivotal fracture studies have introduced important uncertainty regarding the 
existence and magnitude of any CV risk and this differed from the CHMP view that the imbalance observed in 
20110142 or the meta-analysis conclusively established the identified risk. 
Possible principle causes for the observation in study 142 could include: 
i. 
ii. 
iii. 
Increased risk of a cardiovascular event consequent to exposure to romosozumab 
Decreased risk of a cardiovascular event consequent to exposure to alendronate 
a random low event rate creating spurious imbalance in the context of background low absolute risk 
of cardiovascular events 
iv.  more background cardiovascular disease in women with severe osteoporosis [the population of study 
142 compared to those is study 337] contributing to ‘noise’. 
v. 
other, unidentified cause 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 207/263 
  
  
Clinical and nonclinical evaluations have not identified a mechanism by which romosozumab may exert an 
effect on the CV system and no subgroup can be identified in whom there is increased relative risk vs the 
entire study population. 
Incidence in MACE in the 2 pivotal studies 
The prespecified endpoint for the DCRI adjudication was the subject incidence of positively-adjudicated CV 
serious adverse events (SAEs), with subcategories that captured, among others, cardiac ischemic and 
cerebrovascular events, as well as CV death. 
A posthoc analysis of the composite of MI, stroke, or CV death, ie, MACE, was performed to understand the 
CV safety profile, in line with the EMA reflection paper (EMEA/ CHMP/15404/2007). As shown in Figure 33, 
the subject incidence of MACE in the placebo-controlled study 20070337 was 0.8% in both the 
romosozumab-treated (30 subjects) and placebo-treated (29 subjects) groups. Conversely, in 20110142, 
2.0% (41 subjects) of romosozumab-treated subjects compared to 1.1% (22 subjects) of ALN-treated 
subjects experienced a positively-adjudicated MACE in the 12-month Double-Blind Period.

Hazard ratio and 95% CI are based on Cox proportional hazards model; meta-analysis estimates are based on Cox proportional hazards model stratified by
study comparing romosozumab versus 'control' (either placebo or alendronate).
Study 337 used 1:1 randomization allocation ratio between romosozumab and placebo.
Study 142 used 1:1 randomization allocation ratio between romosozumab and alendronate.
Death events include fatal events adjudicated as cardiovascular-related or undetermined.
While the applicant refered to an EMA reflection paper (Reflection paper on benefit risk assessment methods 
in the context of evaluation of marketing authorisation applications of medicinal products for human use. 
EMEA/CHMP/15404/2007, 19 Mar 2008), in which post hoc analyses are described under benefit where 
companies are invited to consider the impact of a post hoc analysis the current issue, however, is one of 
safety. Therefore the CHMP considers the Reflection paper on assessment of cardiovascular safety profile of 
medicinal products (EMA/CHMP/50549/2015) as more relevant to the subject. It describes among others that 
as a general rule, assuming a comparison against a placebo or standard of care (SOC), the evidence based 
on the cardiovascular safety profile should be planned to obtain an upper limit of the confidence interval (UCL 
- 95%, two sided) for the Hazard Ratio (HR) below 1.8 in the event that HR≈1.

Interpretation of estimates of treatment effects 
For study 20070337, no increase in incidence of MACE was observed in the 12-month Double-Blind Period 
with romosozumab treatment compared to placebo (0.8% in both treatment groups), translating into a 1.03 
HR (95% CI: 0.62, 1.72). In contrast, the HR for MACE in 20110142 was 1.87 (95% CI: 1.11, 3.14), with 
1.1% in the ALN arm and 2.0% in the romosozumab arm, corresponding to an absolute risk difference of 
0.9%. A priori, there was no reason to expect the effect of romosozumab on CV risk would differ between 
these 2 studies. As each study contributed a modest number of events, it is possible the estimated HRs of CV 
risk from each study may reflect random high and/or random low bias and the true association between 
romosozumab and CV risk, if any, is reflected by a magnitude of risk somewhere in between.  
One approach to identifying a plausible estimate is from a meta-analysis of the 2 studies. However, 
heterogeneity in baseline risk, different comparator arms in each study, and inconsistencies in the data from 
study 20110142 suggest that the results of a simple meta-analysis that equally weights the data from the 2 
studies should be interpreted with caution.  
It is agreed that the submitted studies were not designed to look for cardiovascular events. 
The number of cardiovascular events is small over the time period examined; it is known that hazard ratios 
may be dis-informative in the presence of few events and where it cannot be shown that there is a constant 
proportion of hazard between the two study arms (because of small numbers), as is the case here. 
The meta-analysis technique employed by the company is not considered appropriate; the forest plot in 
Figure 33 above is considered to be misleading. A more appropriate meta-analysis technique to combine 
results of different study designs and with different comparators would have been the network meta-analysis, 
as conducted by the FDA for the Evenity application in North America. 
Uncertainties regarding the imbalance in MI and stroke from the ALN-controlled study 
The rate of MACE in the control arms of both pivotal studies 
Despite higher baseline CV risk in 20110142, the rate of MACE in the control arms of both pivotal studies 
aligns through 12 months: 
The CV-related medical history and CV-related baseline concomitant medications of the study populations 
enrolled in studies 20070337 and 20110142 were generally balanced between the treatment groups within 
each study.  
However: 
• 
• 
subjects in 20110142 were on average approximately 3.5 years older than subjects in 20070337 and 
the population in 20110142 had higher prevalence rates of comorbidities than in 20070337, 
highlighted by the higher incidence rates of SAEs in 20110142 compared to 20070337. Prevalence 
rates of CV-related medical histories were generally balanced between the treatment groups within 
each study.  
subjects in 20110142 were more likely to have hypertension, history of coronary artery disease 
(ischemic heart disease, MI), and history of cerebrovascular disease (ischemic stroke or transient 
ischemic attack) than in 20070337. 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 209/263 
  
  
Consistent with the higher rates of all SAEs observed in 20110142 compared to 20070337 and increased 
prevalence of comorbidities and risk factors that might influence the occurrence of CV events, the patient 
population in 20110142 would be expected to have a higher incidence of serious CV events than the patient 
population in 20070337 in both treatment groups. However, in contrast, the ALN-treated subjects in 
200110142 had similar incidence of MACE in particular in the first 12 months of treatment (Figure 34), 
including two episodes of 3 months during which no MACE was reported. The US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) investigated whether there might be a cardioprotective effect of ALN by conducting an 
exploratory network meta-analysis to indirectly estimate the HR of MACE for ALN from 20110142 vs placebo 
from 20070337 during the first year of the 2 studies. Their analysis yielded a HR of 0.55 (95% CI: 0.27, 
1.14) for ALN vs placebo. However, this exploratory network analysis cannot definitively address the CV risk 
of ALN, as a review of the literature and placebo-controlled ALN studies does not suggest a cardioprotective 
effect of ALN (US FDA, Multi-disciplinary review and evaluation [Biologics License Application 761062], 2019).

This phenomenon is not observed over the longer duration of study follow-up (median 36 months) despite all 
subjects receiving ALN. In fact, during the Overall Study Period, the cumulative incidence of MACE in the ALN 
arm is consistent with the population in 20110142 being older and having higher rates of pre-existing CV risk 
factors. As can be seen in Figure 34, rather than continue to align with the rate of events in 20070337, it 
closes the gap with the treatment arm in 20110142 that received romosozumab. 
During the original procedure the assessment of the CHMP agreed with the applicant that there was an 
acceptable balance between arms of each study as described above. Subjects in study 142 had more severe 
osteoporosis (with more consequence such as fracture) compared to subjects in study 337. There is a known 
association between severity of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease (and vice versa) and so the findings 
of the company with regards to more evidence of cardiovascular disease in study 142 may be considered as 
not unexpected.

A signal of cardiovascular risk was also noted in study 20110174 (study of men with osteoporosis), as shown 
in the following table 
A signal of cardiovascular risk was also noted in study 20080289; this was a randomized, open-label, 12-
month, teriparatide-controlled study in 436 postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture 
after transition from < 3 years of treatment oral bisphosphonates. Serious cardiac disorders were reported in 
2.3% for Romosozumab and 0.9% for teriparatide. One serious cerebrovascular accident, one ischaemic 
stroke and one transient ischaemic attack were reported in the Romosozumab group vs none in the 
teriparatide group. It is noted that cardiovascular events were not adjudicated in this study. 
Although studies 20110174 and 20080289 are not decisive with regards to cardiovascular risk, CHMP 
considered that the outcomes add to uncertainty. 
Over time, the Kapplan-Meier curves (Figure 34) seem to cross; however this is only after 48 months. It 
could be interpreted as a fading unfavourable effect of romosozumab. Importantly, after 36 months less than 
half of the subjects were still in the trial, suggesting much uncertainty; at the time-point after 48 months 
only about 12% were still at risk. 
Event rate for the ALN arm 
A standard assumption in the analysis of event-driven endpoints is a constant hazard rate over the course of 
follow-up. This assumption translates into the testable statistical hypothesis of proportion hazards between 2 
arms in the Cox proportional hazard model used to estimate the HR for the treatment effect. It was noted 
that this assumption does not hold for the ALN arm in 20110142 for both the 12-month Double-Blind Period 
and Overall Study Period, where an increasing hazard is observed over time (Figure 34), with the lowest 
annualized rate of MACE observed in the first 12 months (1.1%) and a doubling of this rate by year 3 
(2.2%).  
The Kaplan-Meier curve for time to first MACE in the ALN-treated group (Figure 34) further illustrates this 
inconsistency in event rate across the duration of the study. This behaviour is not consistent with the biologic

mechanism of CV events, where the rate of events would not be expected to increase substantially over a 
time period of only 3 years.

Data of this figure also shown in Figure 30, in section “CV risk factors analysis” In2.6 Clinical Safety 
For comparison, the constant rate of events that would be expected are seen in cardiovascular outcome 
trials; two representative examples are the SAVOR study in 16,492 Type 2 diabetes patients mean age 65 
years and 14% of subjects ≥75 years of age and, CAMELLIA study in 12,000 obese patients with median age 
64 (interquartile range: 58 to 69).  
As shown in Figure 35, for the treatment arm in 20110142, romosozumab followed by ALN, the annual 
incidence in MACE remains constant. The Kaplan-Meier curve further illustrates this linear behaviour 
(Figure 34). In fact, if romosozumab were to affect CV outcomes adversely, then in both 20070337 and 
20110142, the rate would be expected to change after this switch at Month 12 to denosumab or ALN, 
respectively.

Thus, the imbalance in MACE observed in 20110142, is primarily observed during the first 12 months when 
subjects were treated with either romosozumab or ALN. During this time period, 41 romosozumab-treated 
subjects (2.0%) and 22 ALN-treated subjects (1.1%) experienced at least 1 MACE, a difference of 19 
subjects. 
Thus, the applicant argued during the re-examination of the opinion, that in the context of a low background 
absolute risk, the potential for random low event rates creating spurious imbalances should be considered. 
Discussion and Conclusion by CHMP 
The Applicant has provided a meta-analysis of the adjudicated MACE events in the first year in both pivotal 
trials (Figure 33). This analysis results in a Hazard ratio of 1.39 (0.97; 2.00) and an absolute risk difference 
of 0.4% (romosozumab 1.3% v comparator 0.9%). The increased incidence of MACE was not observed in 
20070337, HR 1.03 (95% CI: 0.62, 1.72), but only in 20110142; HR 1.87 (95% CI: 1.11, 3.14). However, in 
the view of the CHMP the meta-analysis techniques employed by the applicant were  not considered 
appropriate. A more appropriate meta-analysis technique to combine results of different study designs and 
with different comparators would have been the network meta-analysis, as conducted by the FDA for the 
Evenity application in North America. 
CHMP agreed with the Applicant that the meta-analysis of the studies is of little help in understanding the 
diverging observations. The Applicant suggested that the difference could be attributed to chance, but also 
explored other explanations. It is noted that the absolute risk of MACE was higher in the latter trial (1.6% v 
0.8%). Subjects in 20110142 were on average approximately 3.5 years older than subjects in 20070337 and 
the population in 20110142 had higher prevalence rates of comorbidities than in 20070337, e.g. 
hypertension (61 v 53%) and ischaemic heart disease (13.6 vs 9.2%), suggesting higher CV risk. The 
observed rate of MACE in the control arms of trial 337 (PBO) and trial 142 (ALN) was similar (0.8%). Based 
on the higher CV risk, the number of MACE events in the comparator arm (ALN) in the first year of trial 142 is 
lower than expected and/or in trial 337 higher than expected. 
In comparison with placebo, ALN could be cardioprotective; however, the applicant was not able to provide 
evidence for that, nor did an FDA review of the literature 
(https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2019/761062Orig1s000MultidisciplineR.pdf and 
https://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/nda/2019/761062Orig1s000TOC.cfm) and placebo-
controlled ALN studies suggest a cardioprotective effect of ALN. As FDA’s network meta-analysis seems to be 
based only on trial 142 and 337, it is therefore subject to the same potential chance events that hamper 
understanding of the differences between the trials. 
Another hypothesis  could be a temporary CV benefit from ALN. While this would explain the observations in 
the 142 comparator group, no such phenomenon is observed in the 142 romosozumab group. In that case, 
the data suggest that romosozumab antagonises any temporary CV benefit from ALN. 
CHMP agreed with the Applicant that the rate of MACE in CV outcomes trials e.g in type 2 diabetes is rather 
constant if no CV-effective pharmacological treatment is given. To correct for any short-term chance effects, 
the Applicant provided a simulation in which the HR for MACE was based on a control-group with ALN using 
data from year 1, 2 and 3. However, it remained unclear why this approach would be essentially different 
from a MACE analysis of the entire trial as presented in an analysis in the original assessment of the 
procedure.

Figure 36:   Meta-analyses: Time to first occurrence of positively-adjudicated cardiovascular 
adverse event leading to death, serious myocardial infarction, or stroke through end of trial 
Based on the meta-analysis, it could be argued that the upper limit of the confidence interval of 1.8 as a 
commonly used threshold (Reflection paper on assessment of cardiovascular safety profile of medicinal 
products (EMA/CHMP/50549/2015)) has been exceeded. However, the submitted studies were not designed 
to look for cardiovascular events. The number of cardiovascular events is small over the time period 
examined; it is known that hazard ratios may be dis-informative in the presence of few events and where it 
cannot be shown that there is a constant proportion of hazard between the two study arms (because of small 
numbers), as is the case here. 
In conclusion, in the view of the CHMP there still seems to be a trend of an adverse effect on MACE through 
treatment with romosozumab, which is observed both in placebo and alendronate controlled trials. The effect 
size in trial 142 could be a random high; but, as discussed above, it is difficult to attribute the complete 
observations to chance. 
Possible identification of a CV risk factor through subgroup analyses that drives the imbalance 
The CHMP in its grounds for refusal stated that: "….. no subgroup without an increased risk [of MACE] has 
been identified". 
The applicant in its responses stated that subgroup analyses were based on categorization of subjects defined 
by the well-established CV risk factors. As expected, they did show higher incidence of events in the high-risk 
subgroup compared to the low-risk subgroup. Yet, the relative risk of events between treatment arms was 
generally consistent within all subgroups and no subgroup was identified with consistently higher or lower 
estimated HRs. In the view of the applicant, the lack of a subgroup effect raises additional doubt about 
whether the risk is accurately reflected by the 20110142 estimate. Study 20110142 appeared to be at 
greater baseline CV risk than study 20070337, based on a higher age and prevalence of CV risk factors, 
comorbidities and concomitant medications. If this higher total CV risk contributed to a further increase in 
risk associated with romosozumab use, then it should be expected that a greater relative risk would be 
observed in the subset of subjects at highest CV risk in either study. On the contrary, all subsets of 
20070337 consistently showed a lack of association between romosozumab and CV events. A subpopulation 
of 20070337 was not identified such that the magnitude of effect observed in 20110142 could be replicated 
or confirmed. In addition, relative risks seen in the subgroup analyses of 20110142 were generally similar to 
the results from the full study population. 
The issue of interpretation of subgroup analyses is also described in: Guideline on the investigation 
of subgroups in confirmatory clinical trials, EMA/CHMP/539146/2013, Jan 2019. 
(https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/scientific-guideline/guideline-investigation-subgroups-
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020

confirmatory-clinical-trials_en.pdf) In this document, the CHMP describes the need for consistency, 
credibility, biological plausibility and replication; the CHMP advice is essentially similar to that 
advised by Altman and colleagues, above. 
The subgroup analyses were assessed in the original assessment. The company presented separate subgroup 
analyses for studies 337 and 142; the analyses for study 337 are pre-specified whereas those for study 142 
are ‘ad hoc’ i.e. post hoc. For study 337 all subgroups lie on the line of unity based on baseline [general] 
characteristics and baseline cardiovascular risk factors. In study 142, exposure to romosozumab [compared 
to alendronate] is associated with a shift rightwards away from the line of unity i.e. apparent higher risk of 
MACE, as described, associated with exposure to romosozumab based on medical history and medication 
history. 
In the view of CHMP, in study 142, subgroup analysis was 
• 
‘ad hoc’ (understood to be ‘post hoc’) 
•  Direction not specified 
•  Not based on small numbers of subgroups i.e. many subgroups displayed 
•  Not large effect / broad confidence intervals 
•  Not consistent with subgroup analysis of study 337 
•  Not [apparently] supported by a biological rationale 
For the above reasons CHMP considered it difficult to give credibility for a particular subgroup effect 
of romosozumab in study 142. A general effect may be present.  
Potential biological mechanism for MACE 
In general, the mechanisms underlying MI and stroke events and CV risk factors are reasonably well 
understood. However, for romosozumab, no causal mechanistic association between sclerostin and/or 
romosozumab and CV risk could be identified, despite dedicated nonclinical studies specifically conducted to 
examine any potential effects as well as an extensive analysis of our own and publicly available genetic, 
nonclinical, and clinical data for sclerostin and/or romosozumab . These studies included evaluations obtained 
from young and aged ovariectomized animals and in normal and diseased animal models, as well as ex vivo 
human atherosclerotic plaques.  
Nonclinical evidence 
The nonclinical data considered during the assessment for a potential mechanistic association between 
sclerostin, romosozumab, and CV risk, and the findings are summarized below. 
• 
There was no evidence of any treatment-related adverse effects on the CV system following 
treatment with romosozumab in the young or aged monkey in studies up to 12 months duration, or in 
the rat in studies of up to 98 weeks duration (Studies 105781, 107426, 107903 and 107895). These 
studies included CV telemetry studies and assessment for any increase in the incidence of tissue 
calcification in rats in a lifetime study and aortic mineralization in aged ovariectomized monkeys.

• 
The key events which lead to MI and stroke, namely plaque rupture, plaque erosion, increased 
thrombogenesis, and vasospasm, and the key pathological mediators underlying each of these 
(combined and modified from Crea and Libby, 2017; Ford et al, 2017; Pasterkamp et al, 2017; 
Hellings et al, 2010; Naghavi et al, 2003) were also evaluated. There was extensive data to support 
this evaluation in either normal and/or diseased tissues. 
There was no evidence that any of the key pathological processes leading to MI and stroke were 
affected by the inhibition of sclerostin in either normal and/or diseased tissues. Specific to this 
assessment, pivotal dedicated studies included assessment of sclerostin expression in 144 advanced 
human atherosclerotic plaques, which showed that sclerostin expression did not correlate with various 
plaque features associated with atherosclerosis or MACE or with the patient’s medical history of CV 
events pre- and post-removal of the plaques assessed. 
In addition, inhibition of sclerostin did not affect atheroprogression in the apolipoprotein E knock out 
atherosclerosis mouse model, neither sclerostin nor romosozumab induced vasospasm in human 
coronary arteries and romosozumab did not induce platelet activation.  
In summary despite intensive preclinical study there was no evidence to support sclerostin or romosozumab 
impacting any mechanism known to be related to MI and stroke. 
Genetic evidence  
In addition to nonclinical data, genetic data were also evaluated for any evidence of a potential mechanistic 
association between sclerostin, romosozumab and CV risk are summarized below. 
•  Sclerosteosis and Van Buchem’s patients are completely deficient in sclerostin or have low levels of 
sclerostin respectively. Sclerosteosis patients typically have a shortened lifespan but at least 5 have 
lived for more than 50 years, without reported CV effects. There are no reports of clinical or 
radiological involvement of the central or peripheral CV system or CV effects in sclerosteosis patients 
(Hamersma et al, 2003) and no mention of CV issues in a clinical management plan (Beighton et al, 
2013). Van Buchem’s patients have a normal lifespan but similarly there are no reports of CV effects 
and no mention of CV issues in a clinical management plan (Beighton et al, 2013). A genome-wide 
association study was conducted to assess for any association between a common sclerostin single 
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that is strongly associated with both sclerostin expression and BMD, 
and a risk of stroke or MI (Study 150655). This SNP was strongly associated with lower sclerostin 
expression, higher BMD, and lower risk of OP and fracture, as expected from the pharmacology, but 
had no significant association with the risk of MI or stroke.  
• 
In Feb 2019, a non-peer reviewed pre-publication manuscript became available online (Bovijn et al, 
2019, http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/531004), which claims there is an association between sclerostin 
SNPs and CV risk. In the view of the applicant, there are several scientific deficiencies in this 
manuscript, including non-standard analysis approaches, which are open to differential interpretation, 
and that the conclusion of an association with CV events is based on the combined effect of 2 non-
independent SNPs and cross-cohort data but, individually, the association with CV events is 
inconsistent between cohorts and sometimes between the 2 SNPs within the same cohort. In view of 
the applicant, these analyses have a high potential to overestimate the evidence of an association 
with CV risk through “double counting” the effects of dependent SNPs.

Overall biological plausibility 
Sclerostin is constitutively expressed in the aorta (Brunkow et al, 2001; Chouinard et al, 2016; Didangelos et 
al, 2010) and upregulated in foci of vascular and valvular calcification (Brandenburg et al, 2013; Kramann et 
al, 2013; Rukov et al, 2016; Zhu et al, 2011). Sclerosteosis is the clinical model of absence of sclerostin 
expression. It is a rare, progressive disorder in which bone overgrowth causes facial distortion and cranial 
nerve dysfunction. The intracranial pressure usually becomes elevated and sudden death often occurs in 
adulthood. In patients with sclerosteosis or van Buchem disease (homozygous for sclerostin gene [SOST]), 
there is no evidence of early onset vascular calcification or increased cardiovascular risk in the literature or 
through written communications with a key scientific expert for the disease state (Beighton, 2011c; Beighton, 
2011d). However, experience may be limited as survival into old age has been unusual. In conclusion, 
althouth the presence of sclerostin receptor in the aorta and calcification centers has been shown. Its role, if 
any, in the process of atherosclerosis is uncertain. With regard to the results from the Bovijn study (see 
above), although it seems to show a relation between sclerostin SNPs associated reduction of fractures, and 
in the same patients an increase in CV risk, the magnitude of this increase in risk remains uncertain, and its 
relevance for above issue remains inconclusive. 
5.1.1.  Risk management aspects  
Regarding the risk management activities proposed for romosozumab, CHMP concluded in their grounds for 
refusal that “the proposed risk minimisation activities (warnings, contraindications) are not considered to 
satisfactorily reduce the risk”. In particular:  
•  Subgroup analyses of 20110142 could not identify populations in which the relative risk of MACE was 
neutral or considerably reduced.  
• 
The Applicant proposed a contraindication in patients with a history of MI or stroke. However, the 
estimated relative risks for MACE and all-cause mortality would have remained largely unchanged. 
Considering the conflicting data from the 2 studies and the small number of overall events in total, there is 
uncertainty as to whether the results from 20110142 represent a true drug-related effect or not. It has not 
been possible to identify a plausible mechanism by which romosozumab would impact the risk of MI and 
stroke and no specific subgroups were identified from the clinical data as being at higher relative risk. 
Therefore, it follows that any risk mitigation measures can only address the absolute risk rather than the 
relative risk. It should be noted that for the individual patient, it is their absolute risk that is relevant in a 
benefit-risk assessment. 
In the following sections, the Applicant addressed the CHMP’s concerns in more detail by discussing the 
proposed risk minimization activities and their anticipated effectiveness. The Applicant has also proposed 
additional activities utilizing the Patient Support Program (PSP) and the post-authorization safety study 
(PASS) to further enhance the existing proposal. 
Current Risk Management Plan and proposed enhancements 
Based on the detailed assessment of the CV events in the pivotal studies, the Applicant considered the risk of 
MI and stroke a potential risk as, based on the data it can neither be concluded nor excluded that MI and 
Assessment report

stroke are drug related. Despite this, the Applicant during the procedure has accepted the risk as an 
“identified” risk in the EU Risk Management Plan (RMP) as a precautionary approach.  
The current EU RMP encompasses both routine and additional pharmacovigilance (PV) and RMMs. These 
include: 
Prescriber Guide 
Patient Alert Card  
Labeling with contraindications and warnings and precautions 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•  Use of detailed follow-up questionnaires for postmarketing reports of MI and stroke. 
Letter to cardiologists and neurologists 
PASS 
These measures are designed to educate and inform the patient and the relevant physicians with a view to 
optimize benefit-risk assessments, including in the event of an acute CV event and encourage appropriate 
communication between the HCPs. In addition, a key objective is to ensure detailed oversight of emerging 
data to be able to identify an emerging safety signal as quickly as possible. When viewed as a whole, these 
measures will provide appropriate risk minimization and PV oversight as summarized briefly below: 
•  The SmPC is utilized to prevent use in those with the highest absolute risk and provide 
information to support the physician in the individual benefit-risk assessments to ensure that for 
patients treated with romosozumab, the benefit risk is positive. 
•  The prescribing physicians and patients are fully informed such that the individual benefit risk 
is carefully assessed and understood before treatment is initiated - via the Patient Alert Card, 
Prescriber Guide, SmPC, and dedicated website. 
•  The prescribing physician is sufficiently experienced to assess benefit risk and oversee 
treatment - limit prescribing to OP specialists. 
•  Rapid medical intervention in event of MI or stroke is facilitated to optimize outcome - via 
awareness of patient and treating physician through Patient Alert Card, Prescriber Guide, SmPC and 
dedicated website. 
•  The care and communication in event of MI or stroke are optimized – via letter to 
cardiologists and neurologists to provide them with the relevant information and Patient Alert Card, 
as well as dedicated website. 
•  Effectiveness of RMMs is measured – via PASS. 
•  An emerging safety signal is identified early – via routine PV activities, including questionnaires, 
and via PASS. 
•  Risk of MI and stroke is further assessed and described – via PASS 
The RMMs as discussed above have already been assessed by the PRAC and were considered to be adequate, 
yet the Applicant is proposing 2 further enhancement to the EU RMP:  
1.  Additional activities to be added to the currently proposed PASS 
2.  Utilizing the PSP  
• 
The distribution and use of the Patient Alert Card will be further leveraged through connection with 
the PSP. The Patient Alert Card will be both included in the Patient Welcome Kit that will be provided 
to each patient by the physician at initial prescription and added it to the PSP website with the 
possibility of downloading additional copies of the Patient Alert Card. 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 218/263 
  
  
• 
For patients participating in the nurse support phone call program of the PSP (currently planned in 
UK, Ireland, Germany and Spain), the nurse will have a conversation with patient/caregiver: 
o  as to whether the Patient Alert Card has been received, remind and encourage the patient to 
carry it at all times, and will respond to any further questions. 
o  will collect information on the use and understanding of the Patient Alert Card – will provide 
evidence of effectiveness. 
The CHMP  agreed with the Applicant that labelling (see below) and education of the prescribers are the most 
important means to optimize the use of romosozumab in subjects who may have the best individual 
benefit/risk ratio. A PASS can clarify if these measures are effective as intended. 
It is not expected that measures aimed at better care for subjects taking romosozumab with a (non-fatal) 
MACE event will have a substantial impact. Instead, these patients will have the usual approach for these 
emergencies and use of romosozumab will barely be considered (and it will not influence diagnostic or 
treatment decision in any way). 
The PASS is discussed further below. 
Labelling 
During the initial review of the MAA for romosozumab, the Applicant addressed the concerns of CHMP 
regarding the benefit risk of the indicated population by proposing substantial changes to the label. These 
changes have been maintained as the Applicant considers them sufficient to enable OP specialists to exclude 
patients with the highest baseline CV risk. 
Contraindication of patients with a history of MI and stroke 
The strongest predictor of a subsequent MI or stroke is a recent MI or stroke. The risk of a further event is 
highest in the first year and continues to decrease with time, thereafter. The proposal to contraindicate 
romosozumab in all patients with a history of MI or stroke regardless of when those events occurred 
represents a conservative approach to manage the absolute risk of CV events. Feedback on the 
appropriateness of this contraindication as a RMM was provided by the experts at both Ad hoc expert (AHEG) 
meetings, where it was generally acknowledged that such a contraindication would reduce the CV risk in 
absolute terms. 
For the remaining population of patients without history of MI or stroke, there are risk factors (eg, age, 
diabetes, renal impairment, smoking) overlapping both osteoporotic fractures and CV disease, yet their 
influence on each of these conditions is different. Accordingly, published data demonstrates that the 2 risks 
weakly correlate at a population level. Studies considering smaller samples showed that these shared risk 
factors can explain only a limited level (maximum up to approximately 10%) of the variance in the CV and 
fracture risk (Kawińska-Hamala et al, 2017; Tasić et al, 2015). This is further confirmed in a large 
epidemiological study of UK Biobank showing in female patients that prior fragility fracture impact on CV-
related hospitalization over 5 years (MI or ischemic heart disease) was not significant (Paccou et al, 2018). 
•  Additional advice provided in Section 4.4 “Special warnings and precautions for use” 
To optimize the individual benefit risk, the Applicant proposed wording as outlined below in the EU SmPC 
Section 4.4 “Special warnings and precautions for use” to ensure that prescribers and patients are informed 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 219/263 
  
  
of the risks in order to make appropriate treatment decisions at an individual patient level (see proposed text 
below). 
•  Restricting prescribing to OP specialized HCP  
The Applicant considered that assessment of the individual benefit-risk balance would be best managed by 
OP specialized HCPs and thus proposed that romosozumab treatment should be initiated and supervised by 
specialist physicians experienced in the management of OP. This will enable appropriate selection of patients 
for whom the benefits from fracture risk reduction clearly outweigh the risk of MACE. This will be achieved by 
the proposed cautionary information in the SmPC and further enhanced through educational materials 
(Prescriber Guide and Patient Alert Card as specified in the EU RMP).

Special warnings and precautions for use 
Myocardial infarction and stroke 
In pooled randomised controlled studies, an increase in serious cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction 
and stroke) has been observed in romosozumab treated patients compared to controls (see section 4.8).  
EVENITY is contraindicated in patients with previous myocardial infarction or stroke (see section 4.3). 
When determining whether to use EVENITY for an individual patient, consideration should be given to her 
fracture risk over the next year and her cardiovascular risk based on risk factors (e.g. established 
cardiovascular disease, hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus, smoking, severe renal impairment, 
age). EVENITY should only be used if the benefit outweighs the risk.  
Patients who develop symptoms suggestive of myocardial infarction or stroke during EVENITY treatment 
should undergo a prompt medical evaluation and discontinuation of therapy should be considered, based on 
an individual benefit-risk assessment.  
[…] 
CHMP agreed with the Applicant and the experts at both AHEG meetings that a contraindication in subjects 
with a history of stroke or myocardial infarction would reduce the CV risk in absolute terms. In addition, 
subjects with a history of TIA, cardiovascular revascularisation or hospitalisation for unstable angina may also 
be considered to have ‘established CV disease’; however, these conditions are less well defined and only 
limited data available form the trials, nevertheless the use of romosozumab in these circumstances is

EMA/26554/2020 
Page 220/263 
  
  
 
cautioned in special warnings. The second AHEG noted that subjects with a history of stroke or MI are easy to 
identify, but recent events are associated with the highest risk. In that respect, the proposal can be seen as 
conservative. 
An initial proposal entailed assessment of the CV risk by OP specialists based on medical history, signs and 
symptoms, and potentially laboratory investigations of lipids, glycaemia and renal function if not yet 
available. The second AHEG concluded that besides adequate history taking no further mandatory specifc CV 
screening program would be adequate. 
To these effects, the company proposed: 
• 
PASS activities to further explore cardiovascular risk; 
•  Risk minimisation measures such as warnings in the PI texts and alerts to patients and prescribers;  
PASS activities and risk minimisation measures are described in the section below. 
PASS 
Additional PV activities are already included in the EU RMP in the form of European multi-national multi-
database PASS during the initial review.  
The first PASS aims to evaluate the adherence to the RMMs among romosozumab users in real-world 
conditions.  
The second PASS aims to assess the incidence of serious CV events in a cohort of users of romosozumab in 
line with the proposed target population and in cohorts of comparable patients treated with currently 
available drugs for OP.  
PASS enhancements  
To further enhance the ability of the previously proposed PASS to assess the potential CV risk, the applicant 
proposed during the re-examination to expand the PASS through 2 additional approaches. 
To enhance the completeness of romosozumab users identification and CV events monitoring, the Applicant 
will explore conducting the PASS in European populations fully covered through nationwide 
healthcare databases, with consistent reimbursement rules, access to health care, and medical coding 
systems. In addition to the SNIIRAM database that covers 98% of the French population already included in 
the study, the Applicant is evaluating the option of including Nordic countries, with healthcare databases 
covering about the same percentage of the population (~98%).  
These populations will be analysed separately within the PASS and will facilitate the implementation of the 
planned subgroup analyses providing a more complete population-based monitoring of the potential CV risk. 
In the second approach, the Applicant plans to integrate existing European high-quality, population-
based registries of CV events into the current PASS. This will enable a more accurate control of bias in 
the comparison between patients prescribed romosozumab and patients treated with currently available 
therapies for OP and thus minimize channelling bias. Furthermore, the quality of the assessment of CV 
outcomes will be enhanced by the registry validation procedures. The Applicant is currently evaluating CV 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 221/263 
  
  
 
 
registries in Sweden and in other European countries. This will be dependent on the willingness of the 
relevant registries to participate. 
In designing the above described enhancements of the PASS, the Applicant aims to cover large enough study 
periods to provide a sufficient sample size to estimate the study parameters with adequate power and thus 
precision. These additional subgroup analyses will be provided as a separate report. 
Information from other regions 
In addition to the above, the Applicant will also submit the protocol-defined outputs from PASS performed in 
US and Japan, where romosozumab has been approved. 
The first PASS aims to evaluate the adherence to the RMMs among romosozumab users in real-world 
conditions. In the view of the CHMP, this study will optimize adherence to the agreed label and is considered 
useful. Based on this assessment, a comparison of the populations in which romozosumab is actually used 
and the studies in the dossier should be an important objective of this PASS. 
The proposed PASS to assess the risk of MACE will aim to exclude an absolute increase in CV risk attributable 
to romosozumab of more than 1%. More detailed objectives are probably not feasible. In a real world setting, 
it is impossible to account for the effect of channelling and confounding by indication, through RMM that were 
implemented and knowledge and opinions in the medical community. Methods like propensity score matching 
will not completely solve such uncertainties and their effectiveness cannot be estimated. 
For the PASS, subgroup analyses are pre-specified; this is acceptable (and is in contrast to study 142 where 
such analyses were done ‘ad hoc’). 
The additional activities in the PASS appear acceptable but are subject to further review and advice by PRAC 
once study protocols become available. 
RMM summary 
The Applicant proposes a comprehensive EU RMP following a thorough review of the most recent EMA RMP 
guidance and the 2014 Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) Working Group IX 
Report “Practical Approaches to Risk Minimisation for Medicinal Products”. In addition, recommendations from 
CHMP and PRAC during the initial review have been addressed. The proposed EU RMP measures for 
romosozumab are comparable to other products with identified or potential ischemic CV risks. The Applicant 
considers these proposed RMMs to be proportionate with the magnitude and the associated uncertainty of the 
potential risk of MI and stroke.  
In patients who are treated with romosozumab, the potential risk of MACE can be adequately managed by 
restricting the initiation of treatment to OP specialists who can appropriately evaluate patients for their 
expected benefit, their baseline CV risk and keep the absolute CV risk low by applying the proposed RMMs in 
the SmPC and educational materials. In addition, the measures will also encourage patients and physicians to 
react quickly to a MACE and thus optimize outcome.  
The proposed PASS will provide appropriate assessment of the potential risk of MI and stroke. Routine PV 
activities in addition to the regular output from the PASS will enable early detection of an emerging signal.

5.1.2.  Overall conclusion on the applicants grounds for re-examination - Safety  
CHMP agreed with the Applicant that there is considerable uncertainty around the associations of 
romosozumab with all-cause mortality and MACE. Taking into account that there was a trial with favourable 
and a trial with unfavourable results, it is, however, not agreed with the Applicant that the average of the two 
is a ‘conservative’ approach to estimate the risk. 
There is much uncertainty as to why subjects exposed to romosozumab in study 142 apparently displayed 
more cardiovascular risk than those exposed to alendronate-only or those subjects in study 337. In this 
respect, trial 142 with the older and frailer population shows most adverse events. The adverse event rate in 
the control group changes (increases) over the course of the trial, which is unexpected. Furthermore, trial 
142 was ALN controlled, but there is no evidence for a beneficial effect (or any other effect) of ALN on MACE. 
As there is considerable overlap between the trial populations in terms of severity of OP more consistent 
results would have been expected.  
Trial 142 is most representative for the currently proposed target population, as the intended indication for 
romosozumab has been restricted to ‘severe osteoporosis’ during the procedure.  
Over the first 12 months of study subjects exposed to romosozumab in study 142 apparently displayed more 
cardiovascular risk than those exposed to alendronate-only or those subjects in study 337. The increased risk 
of approx. 1% is considered to be small and appears to decrease over 36 months of follow-up. 
It was not possible to identify a subgroup in which MACE risk was increased or decreased. Romosozumab 
seems to add a constant relative risk and the additional absolute risk depends on the baseline risk. The 
apparent increased cardiovascular risk in study 142 for those exposed to romosozumab is considered to be a 
general effect rather than a subgroup effect. 
An exact (patho)physiologic involvement of sclerostin in vasculature and atherosclerosis, suggested by tissue 
receptor expression, has not (yet) been elucidated. Non-clinical studies did not identify a mechanism for an 
adverse effect on MACE.   
There was a small difference in all cause mortality that is not entirely explained by the MACE findings. These 
differences were observed in both trials in patients over 75 years of age. The analysis of those over 75yrs 
was a mix of pre-specified and post hoc subgroup analyses; for this reason and because subgroup analyses 
ought not to be the basis for substantive clinical decisions, a specific risk for those over 75yrs cannot be 
concluded (it may be a chance finding).  
5.2.  Grounds for re-examination - Efficacy 
The grounds for refusal were as follows: 
The efficacy of Evenity (romosozumab) for the treatment of osteoporosis appears to be of 
clinically relevant magnitude in the proposed target population of postmenopausal women with 
severe osteoporosis. In subjects with less severe osteoporosis, where there might be a lower 
absolute risk of MACE, the efficacy of romosozumab is less convincing, e.g., a statistically 
significant benefit on non-vertebral fractures and hip fractures could not be shown. 
In particular: 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 223/263 
  
  
 
• 
• 
“the efficacy of romosozumab for the treatment of osteoporosis was acknowledged to be of clinically 
relevant magnitude in the proposed target population of postmenopausal women with severe 
osteoporosis”, yet “in subjects with less severe osteoporosis, the efficacy of romosozumab” is 
considered less convincing, eg, a statistically significant benefit on nonvertebral fractures and hip 
fractures could not be shown. 
“the primary endpoints of both pivotal studies had been met”, and “the effect of romosozumab was 
superior to alendronate for reducing the risk of non-vertebral fractures and hip fractures at the time 
of primary analysis at 33 months”. However, it was also pointed out that “there is no direct 
comparison of the effect size with other potent antiresorptive treatments available”. 
Choice of Comparator and Demonstration of Fracture Risk Reduction 
With regard to the appropriateness of the design of the 2 pivotal studies (20110142 and 20070337), the 
Applicant considered and implemented the recommendations of the CHMP’s osteoporosis guideline 
(CPMP/EWP/552/95 Rev.2, Nov 2006); endpoints include the efficacy for different fracture types (vertebral 
and nonvertebral including hip) and the requirement for long(er) term efficacy data on fracture reduction is 
addressed. With regard to the latter, to satisfy the requirement for long(er) term data beyond the 12 months 
of treatment, the Applicant followed the EU Scientific Advice to compare the sequence of treatment, ie, 
romosozumab followed by an antiresorptive, using ALN as the appropriate standard of care in one of the 
studies (20110142). 
The status of ALN as the standard of care in the post-fracture population is well documented. Data from 
observational studies from UK and Spain show that ALN alone represent up to 78% of the utilized OP 
medicines (Martín-Merino et al, 2017; Royal College of Physicians, 2017). In a Cochrane meta-analysis, ALN 
was associated with a relative risk reduction of 40% to 50% for vertebral (6% absolute risk reduction) and 
hip fractures (1% absolute risk reduction) in secondary fracture prevention with a similar relative risk 
reduction for vertebral fracture in primary prevention (Wells et al, 2008).  
The CHMP acknowledged that in the pivotal studies the Applicant included populations and investigated 
endpoints that are consistent with CHMP’s osteoporosis guideline (CPMP/EWP/552/95 Rev.2, Nov 2006). This 
was confirmed in the scientific advices. However, the endpoints that are defined as most important in the 
guideline were not systematically put high in the statistical hierarchies – this resulted in “nominal” but not 
formal statistically significant results. This issue was not addressed in the scientific advices. The choice of ALN 
as a control treatment in the trial is agreed, as it is used frequently across the EU. However, other therapies 
(e.g. denosumab) may have a more rapid onset of action thus responding to the unmet need brought forward 
by the Applicant. 
Study Outcomes 
Study 20110142 
Study 20110142 enrolled a population of postmenopausal women with severe OP and who, as a consequence 
of their prior fracture(s), were at high risk of subsequent fracture. The CHMP acknowledged that the efficacy 
of romosozumab for the treatment of OP in the proposed target population of postmenopausal women with 
severe OP was of clinically relevant magnitude.  
,The sequential treatment with romosozumab 210mg administered subcutaneously by a healthcare 
professional (HCP) every month (QM) for a year followed by ALN reduced the incidence of new vertebral

fracture at Month 24 from 8.0% in the ALN alone group to 4.1%, with an absolute risk reduction of 4.0% 
(95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.5, 5.6) and a relative risk reduction of 50% (95% CI: 34, 62). 
For nonvertebral fractures, the CHMP also acknowledged that the effect of romosozumab was superior to ALN 
for reducing the risk of non-vertebral fractures (10.6% vs 8.7%) and hip fractures (3.2% vs 2.0%) at the 
time of primary analysis at 33 months. The superiority of romosozumab is further illustrated in Figure 37, 
which provides the broader perspective of the cumulative incidence of clinical, nonvertebral, and hip fractures 
through Primary Analysis.

Study  Month
At the time of the Primary Analysis, 464 subjects had experienced a clinical fracture and 395 subjects had 
experienced a nonvertebral fracture and the median follow-up time was 33 months. The incidence of clinical 
fracture was 13.0% in the ALN group and 9.7% in the romosozumab group, yielding a hazard ratio (HR) of 
0.73 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.88). The incidence of nonvertebral fracture was 10.6% in the ALN group and 8.7% in 
the romosozumab group, yielding a HR of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.66, 0.99). Although significance was not yet 
achieved at 12 and/or 24 months, Figure 37 illustrates that these reductions in fracture risk began as early as 
12 months (when the arms start to separate) and reached statistical significance at the time of the 
prespecified Primary Analysis timepoint, when the study was sufficiently powered to detect differences in 
fracture risk with statistical significance. 
Study 20070337 
The CHMP has acknowledged that study 20070337 demonstrated that “romosozumab reduced the risk of new 
radiological vertebral fractures at 12 and 24 months and the risk of clinical fractures (vertebral and 
nonvertebral) compared to placebo at 12 months” and that, thereby, the predefined primary endpoints of 
comparing romosozumab vs placebo were met. However, it was also pointed out that the effect on 
nonvertebral fractures (secondary endpoint) did not reach statistical significance, and, therefore, the efficacy 
of romosozumab  was considered less convincing in subjects with less severe osteoporosis. 
Iin 20070337, romosozumab reduced morphometric vertebral fractures compared to placebo (p <0.001). At 
12 months, the new morphometric vertebral fracture absolute risk reduction was 1.3% (95% CI: 0.8, 1.8) 
and the relative risk reduction was 73% (95% CI: 53, 84) with romosozumab compared to placebo. At 24

months, the new morphometric vertebral fracture incidence was 2.5% in the placebo-denosumab group and 
0.6% in the romosozumab-denosumab group with an absolute risk reduction of 1.9% (95% CI: 1.3, 2.5) and 
a relative risk reduction of 75% (95% CI: 60, 84). For clinical fractures (defined as a composite of 
nonvertebral fractures and symptomatic vertebral fractures), the study showed significant reduction at Month 
12 with romosozumab compared to placebo (with an absolute risk reduction of 1.2% and a relative risk 
reduction of 36% [p=0.008]).  
With regard to nonvertebral fractures, as illustrated in Figure 38, there was clear separation between 
treatment arms in favor of romosozumab, but the 25% relative risk reduction in nonvertebral fractures at 
both 12 and 24 months did not achieve statistical significance. This observation was influenced by a low 
background fracture rate in the highest enrolling region of Central/Latin America. A significant treatment-by-
region interaction for the nonvertebral fracture endpoint was detected when comparing the Central/Latin 
America population with the remaining Rest-of-World (ROW) population, with no treatment effect observed in 
Central/Latin America, where the background nonvertebral fracture rate (1.2%) was low. In fact, a 
(nominally) significant nonvertebral fracture risk reduction (42%) was observed in ROW (p=0.012).

The CHMP acknowledges the results but had identified limitations of the statistical tesing as follows: 
In study 142, romosozumab 210 mg QM for 12 months followed by alendronate 70 mg QW through the 
primary analysis significantly reduced the risk of nonvertebral fractures by 19% (p = 0.019, 1-sided nominal 
p-value) based on 395 subjects with nonvertebral fractures. Under the group sequential design, with an 
information fraction of 90% (395/440), the significance level at primary analysis (Lan-DeMets alpha spending 
function that approximates a Pocock boundary was determined to be 0.0233 (1-sided). This result is 
significant as 0.019 < 0.0223; consistent with this, the multiplicity-adjusted 2-sided p-value (adjusting for 
the fixed sequence and the group sequential testing) was significant at 0.040. The subject incidences of 
nonvertebral fracture through month 12 and through month 24 were predefined secondary endpoints, but 
were not included in the multiplicity adjustment (and therefore were not formally tested). 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020

The guideline-recommended endpoints to establish efficacy in PMO are vertebral fractures and major non-
vertebral fractures or hip fractures. The Applicant did not include any of the latter in the statistical sequential 
testing procedure, and therefore these cannot be formally tested.  
About 94% of the trial population would be included in the target population as defined by the SmPC, the 
difference being introduced by exclusion of established cardiovascular disease. Obviously, this reduces the 
trial’s power.  
In study 337, non-vertebral fractures were included in the predefined statistical testing sequence. The 
simultaneous comparison of fracture incidence for the secondary endpoints of nonvertebral fracture at 
months 12 and 24. The 25% (95% CI: -5, 47) relative risk reduction with romosozumab for nonvertebral 
fracture through month 12 was not statistically significant (p = 0.096) and the p-value for nonvertebral 
fracture through month 24 (p = 0.029) was nominally significant, but did not meet statistical significance 
after applying the Hochberg procedure to adjust for multiple comparisons (p = 0.057).  
Bone mineral density changes 
Based on the data from 20110142 and 20070337, it has been established that romosozumab does 
significantly reduce the fracture incidence across vertebral and nonvertebral fractures (including hip).  
In addition to these data showing the difference in average BMD increase for both study populations, the 
response rate to treatment at the individual patient level further illustrates the substantial benefit of 
romosozumab.  Figure 39 shows the comparison of increase in BMD at lumbar spine with romosozumab vs 
ALN at Month 12 from 20110142. The “shift” between the 2 curves illustrates the improved response to 
romosozumab compared to ALN in terms of magnitude of BMD increase (horizontal axis), and proportion of 
subjects responding (vertical axis). For example, 68% of subjects treated with romosozumab gained at least 
a 10% increase in BMD compared with only 14.4% of subjects in the ALN group. A similar analysis for BMD 
gains at the total hip (figure not shown) showed 47% of romosozumab-treated subjects gained at least 6% in 
BMD vs 17% with ALN.

With regard to the CHMP’s concern that “there is no direct comparison of the effect size with other potent 
antiresorptive treatments available”, is the Applicant acknowledged that head-to-head fracture data are only 
available for ALN from 20110142. However, in addition to this, BMD comparative data are available for ALN 
(20110142) and TPTD (20080289). Although the baseline characteristics of the study populations are slightly 
different, the BMD gains and superiority of romosozumab is consistently demonstrated. Given this 
consistency, to the applicant superimposed a romosozumab BMD gain curve on a cross-study comparison of 
BMD responses published by Reid (2015) (Figure 40, below). Although cross-study comparisons have 
limitations, this illustrates the substantial difference in BMD gains achieved with romosozumab vs other 
therapies, suggesting that romosozumab would improve efficacy over the OP therapies currently available in 
the EU. 
Figure 40: 
comparison of BMD gains with selected OP therapies

BMD=bone mineral density; OP=osteoporosis  
Based on inter-study comparison, the CHMP acknowledged that the effect of romosozumab on BMD seems 
more rapid and larger than with other agents during the first year. These data are supportive for efficacy. 
However, BMD is not a full surrogate for fracture reduction. 
5.2.1.  Overall conclusion on the applicants grounds for re-examination - 
Efficacy  
The Applicant generally complied with the CHMP guideline on osteoporosis and scientific advice on the design, 
conduct and analyses of the submitted studies. 
It is acknowledged that alendronate represents standard of care and is an appropriate comparator; use of 
alendronate as a comparator is acceptable. Published data describe and confirm the efficacy of alendronate in 
the management of primary osteoporosis and illustrate that alendronate sets a high standard against which 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 228/263 
  
  
 
 
 
to compare romosozumab. The efficacy results over alendronate confirm the importance of the beneficial 
effects of romosozumab. 
There are many other agents available to manage osteoporosis, mostly anti-resorptives such as alendronate. 
There is no requirement to compare romosozumab against these other treatments. 
The primary endpoints in the pivotal studies (Study 2007337 and Study 20110142) had been met. In 
particular, the level of evidence for the primary endpoint Study 2007337 is considered compelling from a 
statistical perspective. The secondary endpoints were generally supportive in both studies.   
In Study 20110142 the cumulative incidence of clinical fracture, nonvertebral fracture and hip fracture up to 
48 months post treatment, was consistently lower in the romosozumab group compared to alendronate 
group. 
In Study 2007337, the cumulative incidence of clinical and non-vertebral fracture up to 36 months post 
treatment was lower in the romosozumab group compared to the placebo group.  
Although the cross-study comparison of BMD gains showed a trend in favour of romosozumab, supporting a 
superior effect, methodological limitations associated with cross-study comparisons mean the observed 
patterns should be interpreted with caution. 
A clinically relevant and superior efficacy over alendronate (in terms of reducing both vertebral and non-
vertebral fractures in patients with severe osteoporosis) has been demonstrated. Although the treatment 
duration is limited to 12 months, the benefits in terms of reducing fractures seen in the first 12 months 
continues to be accrued for the subsequent two years when treatment with romosozumab is stopped and 
treatment is continued with an anti-resorptive agent (denosuzumab or alendronate).  
Additional expert consultation 
Following a request from the applicant at the time of the re-examination, the CHMP convened an Ad Hoc 
Expert group inviting the experts in the field of osteoporosis, cardiology and patient representatives to 
provide their views on the CHMP grounds for refusal, taking into account the applicant’s response. The 
corresponding answers are presented below: 
1. 
Efficacy in the proposed target population 
Do you consider that, based on the available data from study 20070337 (less severe OP) and 
study 20110142 (severe OP), clinical relevant efficacy is established in the proposed target 
population?  
AHEG discussion: Efficacy has been convincingly demonstrated in the view of the experts. The reduction of 
vertebral fractures was demonstrated in both trials 20070337 (FRAME study; romosozumab vs. placebo) and 
20110142 (ARCH study; romosozumab vs. alendronate). Also, in the view of the experts, clinical significant 
efficacy was clearly shown regarding non-vertebral fractures in the intended target population, even though 
statistical significance in formal testing may not have been achieved at various time points. The experts also 
highlighted the exceptional superior efficacy shown in comparison to a commonly used established standard 
treatment as comparator, alendronate. The recalculation of event rates in a subset of patients from study 
337, defined by a CV risk profile comparable to participants of study 142, was considered to be problematic 
to be relied on due to the limitations as a post-hoc analysis. No rebound or increase of fracture risk after 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 229/263 
  
  
 
completion of the romosozumab treatment phase was apparent, and the experts were further reassured by 
the long-term (i.e. including the subsequent time of exposure to antiresorptive therapy) efficacy of treatment 
with romosozumab. The patient representatives (including a patient) participating in the meeting highly 
welcomed the possible future availability of such a treatment. 
2. 
Cardiovascular (CV) risk in OP 
In order to gain insight in the current practices with regard to identification and management of 
CV risk/disease in osteoporosis patients please discuss: 
a. 
the frequency of CV disease in osteoporosis patients and how this currently influences your 
treatment choice for these patients 
AHEG discussion: The experts acknowledged that there is an association between the presence of 
osteoporosis and risk of CV events / manifest CV disease; however, they considered the association as 
relatively weak and of limited practical relevance in guiding patient treatment. 
b. 
how would you interpret the MACE findings in the romosozumab studies 
AHEG discussion: The experts noted the difference in CV event rates between the 2 arms in study 142. 
While this could be due to an effect of romosozumab, the experts also noted the unexpected low rate of CV 
events in the control (i.e. alendronate) arm during the first year (taking into account expected event rates 
considering the CV risk profile of the population of this study) and the resulting non-linearity of the Kaplan-
Meyer curve of the event rate in the patients continuously treated with alendronate. Although any 
interpretation of these curves has severe limitations , the experts agreed that a linear increase would have 
been expected, opening the possibility that the observed difference in event rate to be a chance finding 
originating from a lower than expected event rate in the control arm. It was also discussed whether this could 
be due to a protective effect of alendronate. Notwithstanding that there has been so far no support for 
alendronate having a protective CV effect, including an analysis done by the FDA, some of the experts 
suggested this should nevertheless not be dismissed entirely as a hypothesis (observations of a reduction of 
CV events in one study with zoledronate and an acute phase response as a speculative hypothesis for a 
temporary beneficial effect were mentioned). It was also pointed out that early interim analyses in dedicated 
CV outcome trials have led sometimes to aberrant results in the past which were not confirmed by the 
eventual outcome of these trials. It was also noted that the two curves in trial 142 eventually merge, 
suggesting that there might be no difference in the long-term effect, although it was acknowledged that the 
data at the very end of such curves needs cautious interpretation (i.e. patient selection, number of events – 
subjects). 
Also, the study was neither designed nor powered as a CV outcome trial, and usual limitations of post hoc 
analyses apply. In all, it was agreed with the applicant, that there might have been an overestimation of the 
CV event rate in trial 142, but a real effect cannot be excluded. However, in any case the estimated excess 
rate of MACE events based on the results from the studies in patients without a history of MI or stroke of ca. 
0.3% per year in a post hoc analysis was considered to be considerably smaller than the rate of prevented 
(vertebral) fractures. With regard to the clinical impact of fractures, the patient representatives participating 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 230/263 
  
  
 
in the meeting made a very strong case that even vertebral fractures can have a profound impact on pain-
free living, mobility, independence, and life quality. 
The experts agreed that a contraindication in patients with a history of MI or stroke would reduce the 
absolute risk of CV events and would constitute a meaningful way to mitigate the risk. 
Findings in post-hoc subgroup analyses with small patient numbers where seen critically in general. This 
applies also to the post-hoc subgroup analysis in patients over the age of 75 years; for the latter, they also 
reminded of the very high biological variability of age-related risks in general, including CV risk. 
c. 
In clinical practice, how do you currently assess CV risk in OP patients (e.g. standardized 
tools, imaging, referral) and do you envisage a change in assessing CV risk if romosozumab 
becomes available 
AHEG discussion: The osteoporosis experts stated that prescribers of osteoporosis medicines have already 
some experience with prescribing medicines for the treatment of osteoporosis associated with CV risk, such 
as strontium ranelate or hormone replacement therapy, in the past. It was considered that following 
contraindications based on patients history of MI or stroke would be very straight-forward. Beyond that, any 
concerns of a patient being at an increased CV risk would and should be followed up independently by 
physicians. To mandate the use of other indicators of CV risk, or of a risk score, was considered to be 
impractical, and also not rationally based on data, as such data is not available from the studies, which was 
seen as one of the weaknesses of the studies by one of the cardiology experts. The experts stated that in 
general the highest risk for MI and stroke is in the 3 months after these events and up to one year. However 
they acknowledged that an analysis as to time of MI or stroke after a prior event has not been presented in 
study 142. The proposed contraindication based on a history of MI or stroke was questioned by a cardiology 
expert, as a contraindication for recent MI or stroke during the last year and a warning only regarding events 
further in the past could be considered more adequate and justified. 
3. 
Medical need 
In the context of available treatment options for osteoporosis and  given the  available data on 
efficacy and safety  for romosozumab,  is there an identifiable subgroup of patients who would 
derive a greater relevant benefit with romosozumab that could not be fulfilled by other existing 
treatments and if so, how would you characterise this subgroup? What aspects of the submitted 
evidence and clinical context could be used to reliably identify such a subgroup? 
AHEG discussion: The osteoporosis experts outlined various scenarios where romosozumab would fill a 
need for treatment, such as insufficient effectiveness or intolerance of past treatment, high risk menopausal 
patients using long-term high dose corticosteroids, but also in general patients with a very high risk of 
fracture. Actual eventual use in practice, if the product should be approved, is envisioned to be potentially 
depending on country-dependent health care system, and might be primary therapy, or as second-line 
therapy only. However, even in the latter scenario, experts pointed to data from applicant’s smaller studies, 
showing usefulness even following antiresorptive therapy. They pointed out that the only osteoanabolic 
therapy currently available is teriparatide, which constitutes a limitation of the treatment options. The patient 
representatives very much emphasized the need for romosozumab as treatment option, in particular in 
advanced cases, and where other treatments either have failed or are not suitable. They both emphasized 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 231/263 
  
  
 
 
the high burden of the disease, both for the patients and their families, and found that in their view the 
benefits would far outweigh the associated CV risk in appropriate patients. 
Although some experts were inclined to consider the use of the product in patients at very high risk of 
fracture (e.g. based on FRAX score), even without a prior fracture, they were suggesting that use in 
secondary osteoporosis, such as glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, should be based on dedicated studies. 
It was mentioned that the indication wording “severe osteoporosis in postmenopausal women” without “at 
high risk of fracture” might be considered, depending on precedent with other labelling. 
4. 
Generation of additional data 
Current proposals for risk management include an observational study in the US and EU to further 
characterize CV effects of romosozumab. Please describe if and how already existing datasets or 
other studies (e.g. prospective studies) could inform about effectiveness and safety of 
romosozumab in case it is introduced in the EU. 
AHEG discussion: The possibility of a randomized controlled cardiovascular outcome trial was mentioned 
but the feasibility of such a trial was questioned due to lack of enrichment of CV risk and the consequent 
required sample size. Use of existing/ongoing observational studies of CV events were considered not 
suitable. The possibility of the use of a register to answer this question would result in a large size and 
additionally the problem of the lack of a comparator would arise. 
With regard to the currently proposed observational post authorisation study, there were divergent views 
whether it is possible to satisfactorily adjust for the expected strong channelling bias of higher CV risk 
patients away from romosozumab treatment, and whether such a study could contribute significantly to 
further characterise the possibly small increase in CV risk, beyond what is available from the available RCTs. 
The experts also mentioned, should there be further RCTs in secondary forms of osteoporosis, this would be 
an additional opportunity to prospectively generate additional data for the better characterization of the CV 
safety profile.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable.  
5.4.  Pharmacovigilance  
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.  
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 08.01.2019. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
5.5.  Product information 
5.5.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020

5.5.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Evenity (romosozumab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained 
in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

6.1.  Therapeutic Context 
6.1.1.  Disease or condition 
See section 3.3.1 
6.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
See section 3.3.2.  
In addition, and in further support of the unmet medical need, experts at the second ad hoc expert group 
(AHEG) meeting outlined various scenarios where romosozumab would fill a need for treatment, such as 
insufficient effectiveness or intolerance of past treatment, high risk menopausal patients using long-term high 
dose corticosteroids, but also in general patients with a very high risk of fracture. 
6.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
See section 3.3.3.  
In addition, a study in male osteoporosis (20110174; placebo controlled bridging study in men with 
osteoporosis (N=245), considered as pivotal initially during the assessment, was subsequently considered 
only as supportive, as the Applicant withdrew the request for an indication in that populatation, but was still 
considered, e.g. within safety assessements. 
6.2.  Favourable effects 
Study 337 
Romosozumab reduced the risk of new vertebral fractures compared with placebo up to month 12 (risk ratio 
= 0.27 [95% CI: 0.16, 0.47]). Vertebral fracture risk reduction persisted over the 24-month study period for 
subjects initially randomized to romosozumab, (with patients receiving  romosozumab for 12 months followed 
by denosumab for 12 months) reduced the risk of new vertebral fractures compared with patients receiving 
placebo for 12 months followed by denosumab for 12 months (risk ratio = 0.25 [95% CI: 0.16, 0.40], p < 
0.001). The co-primary endpoints of study 337 were met; secondary endpoints were generally supportive 
towards the primary endpoints. 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 242/263 
  
  
 
Study 142 
Romosozumab 210 mg QM for 12 months followed by alendronate 70 mg QW for 12 months reduced the risk 
of new vertebral fracture through month 24 compared with alendronate alone (relative risk = 0.50; adjusted 
p < 0.001). It also reduced the risk of clinical fractures (nonvertebral fracture and clinical vertebral fracture) 
compared with alendronate alone, based on 464 subjects with clinical fractures (hazard ratio = 0.73 [95% 
CI: 0.61, 0.88], p<0.001). The primary endpoints of study 142 were met; secondary endpoints were 
generally supportive. A clinically relevant and superior efficacy over alendronate (current standard of care 
treatment) in terms of reducing both vertebral and non-vertebral fractures in patients with severe 
osteoporosis has been demonstrated. 
For presentation of additional quantitative outcomes from these two studies see section 3.2. 
6.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Despite the study size, the absolute numbers of non-vertebral fractures were moderate resulting in modest 
absolute risk reductions. In study 20070337 at month 12, hip fractures had occurred in 7/3589 (0.2%) 
romosozumab patients vs 13/3591(0.4%) on placebo. In study 20110142 at month 12, hip fractures had 
occurred in 14/2046 (0.7%) romosozumab patients vs 22/2047 (1.1%) on alendronate.  
A by-region subgroup analysis showed lack of efficacy in Central/Latin America (43% of the randomised 
subjects) and North America (2.7%, very few fractures in total) (see also section 3.3).  
In the pivotal studies, not all results reached formal statistical significance according to the predefined testing 
strategies. However, in the view of the experts of the second AHEG meeting, clinical relevant efficacy was 
clearly shown in the intended target population, including specifically non-vertebral fractures, which was also

6.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile was characterised in a large safety database which included more than 11000 subjects. 
Adverse events following exposure to romosozumab included hypersensitivity reactions (mainly skin), 
injection site reactions, headache and musculoskeletal aches and pains and infections of the upper 
respiratory tract. Instances of hypocalcaemia, osteonecrosis of the jaw and cataract have been reported. 
In general, romosozumab displayed a risk profile that is expected for biological medicinal products. 
All-cause mortality was 30/2040 (romosozumab 1.5%) versus 22/2014 (placebo 1.1%) in trial 142 and 
29/3581 (romosozumab 0.8%) versus 24/3576 (placebo 0.7%) in trial 337 during the 1-year treatment 
period.  
Cardiovascular events: Independent adjudication of serious cardiovascular events was pre-specified in the 
two pivotal studies. An imbalance in positively-adjudicated cardiovascular serious adverse events was 
observed between romosozumab (2.5%) and alendronate (1.9%) in Study 20110142. This imbalance was 
due specifically to serious cardiac ischaemic (0.8% vs 0.3%) and serious cerebrovascular (0.8% vs 0.3%) 
events. Death, serious MI or serious stroke (MACE) occurred in 53/2040 (2.6%) patients treated with 
romosozumab compared to 32/2014 (1.6%) patients treated with alendronate, HR 1.7 (95%CI 1.1-2.6). In 
the larger, placebo-controlled study (Study 20070337) the adjudicated MACE HR was 1.1 (95%CI 0.7-1.7).

6.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
A cardiovascular risk signal has been noted in study 142 yet not in study 337. Within the 12 month controlled 
period, 2% subjects in study 142 experienced a positively-adjudicated cardiovascular event leading to death, 
serious myocardial infarction or stroke versus 1.1% exposed to alendronate. This is in contrast to the 0.8% 
of subjects in both arms of study 337 who experienced stated adverse event in the first 12 months. The 
cardiovascular risk in study 142 is considered to be a general effect rather than a subgroup effect. A meta-
analysis based on data from the 2 studies provided by the applicant during re-examination was considered 
not to resolve the uncertainties regarding the issue on the grounds that the designs of studies 337 and 142 
are too different. 
There are many uncertainties with regard to the interpretation of the cardiovascular risk as ascertained in 
study 142: 
- 
- 
The non-clinical studies have not shown any strong evidence to suggest a biological plausibility for 
Evenity to increase the risk of MACE 
The study 142 was not designed to evaluate the cardiovascular risk and the total number of 
cardiovascular events observed in the study is small as compared to dedicated cardiovascular 
outcome studies. Moreover the analyses of MACE used a conservative approach i.e. the undetermined 
deaths where a non-cardiovascular cause could not be confirmed were treated as ‘cardiovascular 
deaths’. 
-  Whilst the observation could suggest an increased risk for romosozumab in the first year, this could 
also be due to a temporary cardioprotective effect of alendronate 
- 
The study population had a background risk of cardiovascular disease and this in context of the 
overall small number of events may also suggest that this is a spurious imbalance especially when 
compared over a 12 month study period which is short for such comparisons 
-  When treatment with romosozumab was stopped after 12 months and patients were switched to 
alendronate, there was no marked decrease in the rate of MACE events as would be expected if it was 
the cause of MACE and contrary to expectations, the rate of MACE events increased in the 
alendronate arm in the subsequent two years although there was no change in treatment in that arm 
The major uncertainties in this application caused by inconsistent results in the two large trials that were 
submitted could not be resolved by further analyses duing the re-examination. Study 20110142 in severe OP 
included women that were on average older and had more comorbidities than those in study 20070337, 
which included women with a broader OP-severity range from less severe to severe OP. The first trial was 
actively controlled with alendronate, which is agreed to represent the standard of care. In the course of the 
procedure, the Applicant presented post-hoc analyses representing respectively 94% and 38% of the trial 
populations of the 2 studies, respectively, aiming to match the treatment population foreseen in the proposed 
SmPC (see also section 6.6). As that definition is data-driven, it is difficult to value these analyses and the 
results of the post-hoc analyses between the two trials remained discrepant. 
Given the above uncertainties, an increased risk of MACE associated with the use of romosozumab can 
neither be confirmed nor excluded. Interpreting the above results in the context of the placebo controlled 
study which showed no increased risk (albeit in a study population of varying osteoporosis severities), it is 
Assessment report  
EMA/26554/2020 
Page 244/263 
  
  
likely the observed small increase in absolute risk (absolute risk difference of 0.92% for 12 months for MACE 
in study 142) is over-estimated, particularly when the overall risk after three years in study 142 seems more 
comparable between the two treatment groups. 
For further information regarding uncertainties regarding neoplasms, hypocalcaemia, and the use in patients 
with severe renal impairment see section 3.5.

6.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
6.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The aim of treatment of osteoporosis is prevention of fractures. Patients with new clinical fractures, defined 
as symptomatic vertebral fractures and nonvertebral fractures encompass all major fracture categories. This 
endpoint was assessed as one of the key endpoints in the main trials submitted by the applicant. In the 
context of this benefit-risk assessment, these symptomatic fractures are considered most relevant for the 
patient and reflect disease burden. 
With regard to fracture reduction, clinical fractures were statistically significantly reduced in trial 142, which 
is especially relevant considering that this was over active treatment/standard of care and not placebo. The 
effect size of around 25% fracture reduction is considered clinically relevant. The result was not statistically 
significant in trial 337 based on Applicant statistical analysis strategy at some of the time points. The result 
on clinical fractures is supported by statistically highly significant results on vertebral fractures in both trials. 
The results on major non-vertebral fractures did not reach statistical significance creating an uncertainty 
although the estimate for the relative risk reduction is between 25 and 50%. It was acknowledged that these 
studies were not designed to demonstrate a significant effect on non-vertebral fractures. The result is 
supported by results for change in BMD that suggest a rapid and large increase in interstudy comparisons. 
Further, from a clinical perspective, romosozumab demonstrated better effects on both vertebral and non-
vertebral fractures than alendronate in study 142, an effect which was maintained over the subsequent two 
years. Moreover, in both AHEG meetings, the experts endorsed the view that the results from both studies 
taken together were supportive of an inference of a clinically relevant effect on both vertebral and non-
vertebral fractures, which was also acknowledged by CHMP. The effect is considered to be superior to 
alendronate (representing commonly used standard of care) and so would be able to address an unmet 
clinical need. The inputs from patient representatives suggested that prevention of both vertebral and non-
vertebral fractures were important as even vertebral fractures can result in pain and disabilities which 
severely affect their daily life.  
During the initial assessment, major concerns arose over increased all-cause mortality and increased serious 
adverse cardiovascular events, especially during the first year of trial 142. This safety issue seemed to 
concern the most frail patients more, notably those over 75 years. The discussion provided by the Applicant 
in this re-examination supports that chance events may have led to over-estimation of the risk in the first 
year. Further the review showed that the initially perceived risks in those over 75 years were based on a 
post-hoc sub-group analyses and not a robust observation. Taking into account the follow-up period, during 
which both treatment groups were actively treated (in trial 142 with alendronate, in trial 337 with 
denosumab), the mortality differences disappear and magnitude of the unfavourable effects on MACE 
decreases relevantly. It is considered that the cause of the cardiovascular risk signal is uncertain. Although 
the risk of MACE events in the target population is considered to be small, it cannot be excluded, and has 
therefore been now addressed as an identified risk in the risk management of the product. 
To mitigate the risk several risk minimisation measures are foreseen, such as a contraindication for use in 
patients with history of MI or stroke, warnings in the PI text, prescriber guide for careful evaluation of

individual benefit-risk when patients have increased baseline cardiovascular risk and patient alert card with 
key messages; these measures are considered adequate by CHMP and the exclusion of patients with history 
of MI and stroke was shown in the post-hoc analyses to considerably reduce the increase in absolute risk of 
MACE. The experts at the second AHEG meeting also considered these risk minimization measures 
appropriate. 
The management of the risk will include two PASSs to further address uncertainties in risk, in particular 
cardiovascular risk. The first PASS will follow the use of romosozumab in practice by studying adherence to 
the risk minimization measures in the product information incuding adherence to contraindications. The 
second PASS intends to assess potential differences in the incidence of serious cardiovascular adverse events 
between romosozumab and currently available therapies used in comparable patients in real-world conditions 
in a cohort of users of romosozumab using national healthcare databases. 
6.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
A clinically relevant and superior efficacy over alendronate (current standard of care treatment) in terms of 
reducing both vertebral and non-vertebral fractures in patients with severe osteoporosis has been 
demonstrated. Romosozumab rapidly increases BMD and although the treatment duration is limited to 12 
months, the benefits in terms of reducing fractures seen in the first 12 months continues to be accrued for 
the subsequent two years when treatment with romosozumab is stopped and treatment is continued with an 
anti-resorptive agent like denosumab or alendronate. Both vertebral and non-vertebral fractures can be 
debilitating and adversely affect the quality of life. As romosozumab can offer better protection than the 
current standard of care, it can address an unmet clinical need.  
The safety of romosozumab has been well characterised except for an uncertainty with regard to an increased 
risk of MACE (composite of myocardial infarction, stroke and cardiovascular death) which was seen in study 
142 (compared to alendronate) and not seen in study 337 (compared to placebo). This risk can be neither 
confirmed nor excluded despite a large safety database. The estimated absolute risk difference is small. 
Detailed analyses suggest that this risk is likely to be over-estimated in study 142. Excluding patients with a 
history of MI and stroke is expected to further reduce the absolute risk. The use in patients with any other 
cardiovascular risk should be cautious with consideration of likely benefits and potential risks being fully 
discussed by the physician and the patient in each individual case. These measures are considered to 
adequately mitigate the risks. PASSs to follow the use of romosozumab in practice complement these 
measures. 
The clinical benefit of the reductionof bone fracture demonstrated across various fracture outcomes  is 
considered to outweigh the described risk of adverse cardiovascular events in patients with severe 
postmenopausal osteoporosis at high risk of fracture. 
6.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Evenity is considered positive by the CHMP.

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 27 June 2019 
Evenity EMEA/H/C/004465 
The undersigned members of CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s opinion recommending the refusal of the 
granting of a Marketing Authorisation for Evenity. 
The reasons for the divergent opinion were as follows:  
1.  Superior  efficacy  of  romosozumab  over  alendronate  (standard  of  care)  has  been  established 
unequivocally. In postmenopausal women with severe osteoporosis and who are at high risk of fracture, 
this  superior  efficacy  represents  a  major  clinical  benefit.  Osteoporotic  fractures  are  associated  with 
substantial pain, disability, need for long term care and ultimately early mortality.  
2.  An excess incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) was observed in study 142 (41 of 
2040 patients for romosozumab versus 22 of 2014 patients for alendronate).  However there is no clear 
mechanistic explanation for this difference, either for a protective effect of alendronate or a detrimental 
effect of romosozumab. Furthermore, a number of inconsistencies in the data call into question whether 
this imbalance in MACE events is due to a true increased risk or represents a chance finding. These 
inconsistencies include: 
a.  In the other large study (337, placebo controlled) the patient population was younger and had 
a generally lower cardiovascular risk, but as it was a larger study, total numbers of MACE were 
about the same as in study 142. In study 337 the incidence of MACE events was the same as 
for  placebo  (30  of  3581  patients  for  romosozumab  versus  29  of  3576  patients  for  placebo). 
This result contradicts the adverse finding for MACE in study 142.  
b.  In the cumulative incidence plots for MACE events for the two studies, the incidence of MACE 
events for the alendronate arm in study 142 closely follows the curves for the romosozumab 
and placebo arms in study 337. This might be considered unexpected, as the patient population 
in study 337 was younger and had a generally lower cardiovascular risk. After about 18 months, 
the incidence of MACE events for the alendronate arm in study 142 accelerates so that at the 
final  36  month  time  point  there  is  essentially  no  difference  in  the  number  of  MACE  events 
between the romosozumab and alendronate arms. These observations suggest that the adverse 
finding  for  MACE  in  study  142  can  be  attributed  to  an  unexpectedly  low  incidence  of  MACE 
events at 12 months in the alendronate arm, rather than a higher than expected incidence in 
the romosozumab arm.  
Apparently significant imbalances between treatment groups (for both efficacy and safety events) can 
be expected to occur from time to time in clinical data sets submitted for regulatory scrutiny. The data 
should be interpreted with caution.  
3.  Even if the observed excess MACE risk in study 142 is a true finding, the absolute risk is low. The risk 
will be further reduced by the contraindication, warnings and precautions proposed by the applicant.  
4.  Romosozumab  has  been  shown  to  be  a  highly  effective  medicine,  in  a  new  class,  for  a  chronically 
debilitating  and  sometimes  life-threatening  condition  for  which  currently  available  treatments  are  of 
limited effectiveness. Patients, appropriately advised and supported by their treating physicians, should 
be  allowed  the  possibility  to  decide  whether  the  demonstrated  reduction  in  the  occurrence  of 
Assessment report

osteoporotic  fractures  in  comparison  with  alendronate  outweighs  for  them  a  small  possible  absolute 
risk  of  an  adverse  effect  on  cardiovascular  risk.  For  many  postmenopausal  women  with  severe 
osteoporosis and high risk of fracture, the benefit/risk will be considered positive.

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 17 October 2019 
Evenity EMEA/H/C/004465/0000 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending the 
granting of the marketing authorisation of Evenity indicated for the treatment of severe osteoporosis in 
postmenopausal women at high risk of fracture.  
The reason for divergent opinion was the following: 
• 
The increased risk of MACE documented in study 20110142, which included the finally proposed 
target population of postmenopausal women with severe osteoporosis is a major concern. The 
proposed risk minimisation activities (warnings, contraindications) are not considered to satisfactorily 
reduce the risk considering that the mechanism is not known and no subgroup without an increased 
risk of MACE has been identified. Trends for increased risk of MACE with numerical imbalances were 
also observed in study 20110174 on male osteoporosis and in study 20080289 comparing 
romosozumab to teriparatide in subjects who transitioned from bisphosphonate therapy, thus 
supporting the observed cardiovascular safety signal. In addition, in the pooled safety data set, an 
increased risk of all cause mortality in patients 75 years of age and older was documented. 
• 
The efficacy of Evenity (romosozumab) for the treatment of osteoporosis in study 20110142 appears 
to be of clinically relevant magnitude in the proposed target population of postmenopausal women 
with severe osteoporosis, however, the totality of the efficacy data of romosozumab is less 
convincing, as in a study including severe and less severe stages of osteoporosis (study 20070337) a 
statistically significant benefit on non-vertebral fractures and hip fractures could not be shown.

TARGET POPULATION(S)
SI.1.
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded ribonucleic 
acid (RNA) beta-coronavirus that is genetically related to the coronavirus responsible for the 
2003 SARS global outbreak {Fehr 2015, Gorbalenya 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) 
2020c}. In December 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 began in Wuhan, China where the virus 
was detected in three pneumonia patients who were connected to a cluster of cases with acute 
respiratory illness {Wu 2020a}. The virus subsequently became widespread throughout mainland 
China via suspected person to person transmission {Li 2020}. 
The primary route of transmission is through close contact (i.e., within approximately two 
meters) with an infected person mainly through respiratory droplets {Meyerowitz 2021}. The 
recommended practices to limit direct viral transmission include respiratory etiquette and proper 
hand hygiene, cleaning and disinfecting surfaces regularly, maintaining physical distances, 
avoiding those with fever or respiratory symptoms, and for healthcare workers to follow droplet 
and contact precautions when caring for COVID-19 patients in the clinical setting {World Health 
Organization (WHO) 2020a}.
The introduction of COVID-19 vaccines, which began at the end of 2020, provided an additional 
tool for lowering risk of transmission and attenuating disease severity in infected individuals. 
The first COVID-19 vaccine that became available under emergency use authorization was the 
Pfizer-BioNTech mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified), which was authorized in 
December 2020 for individuals from 12 years of age and older in European Union and European 
Economic Area (EU/EEA), United States (US), Canada, and several other countries. At the end 
of 2021 there were ten COVID-19 vaccines authorized for use by the WHO under Emergency 
Use Listing, and several other vaccines have been approved for use by individual countries via 
domestic emergency use authorization based on national regulations {World Health Organization 
(WHO) 2022c}. Currently, monovalent vaccines are also available for children from 6 months 
through 11 years of age. Estimates of vaccination rates vary widely worldwide, with over 70% of 
the population being fully vaccinated in high and upper middle-income countries, about 38% in 
lower middle-income countries and about 5% in low-income countries {Our World in Data 
2022}.
Over time, mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome have occurred, and certain variant strains 
emerged rapidly with evidence of increased transmissibility, clinical implications, and/or impact 
on effectiveness of public health measures, termed as variants of concern {World Health 
Organization (WHO) 2022d}. The Delta variant (B.1.617.2 lineage) was first identified in 
December 2020 in India and thereafter became the most prevalent globally. It was reported that 
Delta was more transmissible and has posed an increased risk of hospitalization {World Health 
Page 12
Veklury (Remdesivir)
EU Risk Management Plan
Final
Organization (WHO) 2022d}. In November 2021, the original Omicron variant (B.1.1.529 
lineage), sublineage BA.1, was first reported in Botswana and South Africa, and surpassed the 
Delta variant as the most prevalent strain in several areas including the US, United Kingdom 
(UK), and EU/EEA as of January 2022 {Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 
2022a, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) 2022a, UK Health Security 
Agency 2021}. Currently, sublineages BA.2, BA.4, and BA.5 are the dominant strains 
circulating worldwide {World Health Organization (WHO) 2022b}, and sublineage BQ.1 is 
emerging in France, Belgium, Ireland, The Netherlands, and Italy {European Centre for Disease 
Prevention and Control (ECDC) 2022c}. As new mutations occur, data on clinical implications 
are being identified, monitored, and new evidence is emerging.
SI.1.1.
Incidence and Prevalence
As COVID-19 testing strategies and availability vary by worldwide and change over time, 
assessment of global incidence and prevalence are not robust{Kalish 2021} {Lipsitch 2020}. 
Reliable estimates on true incidence and prevalence in populations are also lacking and are 
considered underestimates, as mild cases may not be tested and reported, and symptomatic cases 
that resolve and recover are not enumerated systematically {Clarke 2022, Verity 2020}. Despite 
these challenges, passive surveillance of reported cases across geographies in a timely manner 
provide meaningful information on the pandemic’s progress overtime and regional variation.
As of 09 October 2022, there were 618,507,182 cumulative cases reported according to local 
case definitions and testing strategies and reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). 
Increased weekly case reporting was observed globally during times of increased transmission 
due to seasonality and emergence of variants of concern, however regional variability exists. For 
example, the circulation of the COVID-19 Delta variant and rapidly increasing emergence of the 
Omicron variant resulted in increases of reported cases in the WHO regions of Africa, Europe, 
and the US at the end of 2021, while the number of cases in the South-East Asia and Eastern 
Mediterranean regions declined during that time and rose in early 2022 {World Health 
Organization (WHO) 2022a}. Since then, cases have declined overall since the initial spike due 
to the emergence of the Omicron variant. By WHO region, Europe has the largest number of 
cases reported (256,019,483 [41%]), followed by the Americas (178,832,851 [29%]), Western 
Pacific (90,869,335 [15%]), South-east Asia (60,339,540 [10%]), Eastern Mediterranean 
(23,107,748 [4%]), and Africa (9,337,461 [2%]) {World Health Organization (WHO) 2022b}. 
The numbers of COVID-19 cases and deaths reported in the European region from December 
2019 to October 2022 are presented in Figure SI.1. The following European countries reported 
the highest number of cumulative cases as of 28 October 2022: France (36,750,554), Germany 
(35,523,412), United Kingdom (23,898,485), Italy (23,475,187), and Russian Federation 
(21,409,815) {European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) 2022d}.
Overall, the 14-day incidence rate reached a peak in the weeks of November 2020 
(624.0 per 100,000 population), and subsequently decreased to 286.7 per 100,000 before surging 
to a second peak of 496.0 per 100,000 in March 2021 {European Centre for Disease Prevention 
and Control (ECDC) 2021a}. Since then, the 14-day incidence rate steadily declined through 
June 2021, coinciding with gradual vaccine uptake in EU/EEA countries, though rates increased 
Page 13

Final
thereafter due to the emergence of the Delta and Omicron variants, reaching a new peak of over 
1,000 per 100,000 at the start of 2022 {European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control 
(ECDC) 2021c}. Since then, incidence rates have declined overall, and as of 09 October 2022, in 
the EU/EEA, the 14-day incidence rate was 636 per 100,000 population; the lowest rate per 
100,000 population was reported in Norway (18.2), and the highest rate was reported in Austria 
(2,550) {European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) 2022b}.

Demographics of the Population in the Authorized Indication
Persons of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Weekly incidence rates in the 
European region from August 2020 to October 2022 are presented in Figure SI.2 {European 
Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) 2022d}. At the beginning of the pandemic, 
incidence was highest among those aged 65 years old and above. As targeted public health 
measures were adopted to protect older individuals, such as improved infection control measures 
in nursing homes and vaccination programs targeting the ≥65 age group first, reported cases 
among those 65 years and older declined, while cases among those between 15 and 64 years old 
increased {European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) 2022a}. At the end of 
2021, incidence was highest among age groups below 65 years, with steep increases among the 
25 to 29, 15 to 24 and less than 15 age groups as the Delta and Omicron variants emerged 
(Figure SI.2). Currently, incidence rates are highest among older age groups in Europe,

with a 14-day case notification rate of 669 per 100,000 among those aged 65 years and above 
{European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) 2022b}. Rates of severe disease, 
hospitalization, and death are higher compared to the below age 65 group. {Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) 2021, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control 
(ECDC) 2022a}.

Overall children comprise a small proportion of the reported cases worldwide, though over time 
this portion has steadily increased {Cai 2020, Qiu 2020, U. S. Department of Health & Human 
Services (DHHS) 2020}. In the US, the proportion of cases among children below age 
12 increased from less than 4% at the start of the pandemic to approximately 15% in mid-2021, 
at which time hospitalizations among the paediatric population in the US increased {Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2021, Jones 2021}. In EU/EEA, 14-day incidence rates 
were lowest among children younger than 15 years compared to all other age groups for most of 
the pandemic and did not surpass 500 cases per 100,000 population until the emergence of the 
Delta and Omicron variants in 2021 (Figure SI.2) {European Centre for Disease Prevention and 
Control (ECDC) 2022a}. At the end of 2021, the rate exceeded 1,000 cases per 100,000 among 
children younger than 15 years and was the highest of all age groups, with evidence of greater 
burden among the 5 to 9 age group {European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control 
(ECDC) 2022a, UK Health Security Agency 2021}. Further, as testing is less likely to occur 
among those with mild symptoms or asymptomatic infection, estimates on the true burden of 
COVID-19 among this age group are not known.

In the EU/EEA and the UK, hospitalization rates vary by age. Among those aged 29 or younger, 
1.3% result in hospitalization, 3.9% among those aged 30 to 59 years, 12.8% among those aged 
60 to 69 years, 26.1% among those aged 70 to 79 years, and 34.9% among those 80 years and 
older {European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) 2021b}.
Globally, rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection among pregnant women admitted to or receiving care 
at a hospital for any reason vary by region and country income level. Overall, the estimated 
infection rate among this patient population is 8% (95% Confidence Interval [CI] 7% to 9%), 
with highest rates of infection observed in the Latin America and Caribbean region (19%, 95% 
CI 12% to 27%) and lower-middle-income countries (13%, 95% CI 6% to 23%). The lowest 
rates of infection were observed in the East Asia and Pacific region (0.4%, 95% CI 0% to 2%) 
and upper-middle income countries (5.7%, 95% CI 5.6% to 5.9%) {Sheikh 2022}.
Although early studies observed males comprised a higher proportion of reported COVID-19 
cases compared to females {Chen 2020b, European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control 
(ECDC) 2020, Onder 2020, Yang 2020, Zhou 2020} and a higher proportion of COVID-19 
deaths compared to females among reported cases {Wu 2020a}, current literature does not note 
any significant differences in COVID-19 diseases by gender.
SI.1.3.
Main Existing Treatment Options
Treatment of COVID-19 varies depending upon stage and severity of disease. Those with mild 
illness tend to recover on an outpatient basis, with supportive care and isolation to prevent 
disease transmission.
Moderate illness among patients with COVID-19 requires monitoring for progression of 
symptoms and may require hospitalization. Those with severe illness require hospitalization, and 
specific treatments for use against SARS-CoV-2 infection vary by disease stage {Gandhi 2020}.
To treat symptoms associated with COVID-19, patients are given supportive care and oxygen 
supplementation via non-invasive or mechanical ventilation. In patients with COVID-19 
pneumonia who require supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation, dexamethasone or 
systemic corticosteroid + tocilizumab are available treatment options as well as anakinra which 
is recommended for patients who require supplemental oxygen (low- or high-flow) and are at 
increased risk of progression to severe respiratory failure (as determined by plasma concentration 
of soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor ≥ 6 ng/ml). In critically ill patients with 
extremely low blood pressure or secondary bacterial infections, vasopressors and/or antibiotics 
may be prescribed, respectively {European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) 
2020}.
For patients who do not require supplemental oxygen but are at increased risk of progression to 
severe COVID-19 based on underlying risk factors the following alternative treatment strategies 
are available: antiviral nirmatrelvir/ritonavir and monoclonal antibodies 
(tixagevimab/cilgavimab, casirivimab/indivimab, regdanvimab and sotrovimab). Also, an 
antiviral molnupiravir and monoclonal antibodies (bamlanivimab/etesevimab) were 
recommended for this patient population following review under Article 5(3).

Natural History of the Indicated Condition including Mortality and 
Morbidity
The manifestation of COVID-19 among persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection varies widely, 
from asymptomatic infection to severe illness that may result in respiratory failure and 
multiorgan dysfunction leading to hospitalization and death. The onset of symptoms due to 
SARS-CoV-2 infection appears after an initial incubation period that ranges from one to 14 days, 
with most cases occurring approximately four to six days after exposure {Backer 2020, Guan 
2020, Li 2020}. Symptomatic infection severity ranges from mild or moderate (including those 
without pneumonia or with mild pneumonia), reported in 81% of cases, to severe disease (14%), 
critical disease (5%), and death (2.3% overall) {Wu 2020b}. Common symptoms among mild 
cases included those related to viral pneumonia such as dry cough, fatigue, fever, and 
lymphopenia. Severe cases have dyspnea or hypoxia, and critical cases result in respiratory 
failure, shock or multiorgan dysfunction. Some studies have reported that approximately half of 
mild cases progressed to develop dyspnea over five to eight days after initial symptom onset, and 
to mechanical ventilation in 10 days {Deng 2020, Huang 2020a, Wu 2020b}. Other symptoms 
include headache, hemoptysis, diarrhea, anosmia, dysgeusia, and upper respiratory symptoms, 
such as sputum production {Giacomelli 2020, Huang 2020a, Rothan 2020}.
While most COVID-19 cases result in mild illness, defined as mild symptoms (e.g., fever, cough, 
anosmia/dysgeusia) without dyspnea and clinical/radiological evidence of lower respiratory tract 
infection (with oxygen saturations ≥94%), literature describing the detailed clinical course 
among these patients is lacking {Gandhi 2020}. Recent studies following adult outpatients via 
phone survey or non-hospitalized isolation have found that among patients with mild illness, 
symptoms at presentation were similar to those of patients who eventually required 
hospitalization. However, symptoms lasted one to two weeks after initial diagnosis among those 
with mild illness, compared to three to four weeks amongst those with moderate illness who 
eventually required hospitalization, notably for lower respiratory symptoms such as chest pain 
and dyspnea {Blair 2021}. Several retrospective analyses, have shown that up to 75% of adult 
outpatients who had never been hospitalized reported persistent symptoms one to two months 
after initial symptom onset, with approximately 5% of outpatients in one study seeking medical 
care for chronic COVID-19 symptoms at four weeks after initial symptom onset {Blair 2021, 
Carvalho-Schneider 2021, Vahey 2021}.
Worldwide, rates of disease severity and hospitalization vary based on a combination of factors, 
including outbreak response, testing availability, population demographics, and characteristics of 
circulating variants within a geography. Complications observed during disease progression have 
been reported, though frequencies observed are mainly based on smaller patient cohorts. Among 
patients with severe disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a major 
Page 17

Final
complication, developing in 20% of those with mild illness a median of eight days after initial 
symptom onset, with greater risk among patients with diabetes, hypertension, or are greater than 
65 years old {Wang 2020a, Wu 2020a}. Among patients with severe disease, elevated 
inflammatory markers and proinflammatory cytokines have been associated with progressing 
onto more critical infection or death {Huang 2020a}.
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients at various stages have an increased risk of COVID-19 
infection {Kunutsor 2020}. CKD patients also tend to have more severe outcomes than those 
who do not have CKD {Zhou 2020, Henry 2020}. A meta-analysis of patients with CKD found 
that incidence of COVID-19 was higher in people with CKD treated with dialysis than those not 
requiring kidney replacement therapy (KRT) or in kidney or pancreas/kidney transplant 
recipients {Chung 2021}. Acute kidney injury (AKI) patients requiring KRT is common among 
hospitalized, critically ill COVID-19 patients (5-9%) and increases the overall hospital mortality 
rate {Robbins-Juarez 2020, Zhou 2020}.
Early evidence didn’t appear to indicate an association between Chronic Liver Disease (CLD) 
and prognosis of COVID-19 with respect to disease severity and mortality {Wu 2020c}. 
However, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 40 studies including more than 
900,000 patients demonstrated that COVID-19 patients with CLD experience more severe 
disease and higher mortality compared to COVID-19 patients without CLD. Namely, for 
mortality the pooled odds ratio (OR) was 2.35 (95% CI, 1.84–3.00) in CLD versus non CLD 
patients; The odds of developing severe disease among COVID-19 patients with CLD were 2.44 
times higher than among patients without CLD{Nagarajan 2022}. These findings are in line with 
the results of a meta-analysis of nine studies with a total of 2115 patients, showing that patients 
with COVID-19 have a high prevalence of liver injury and that liver injury is associated with an 
increased risk of severity and mortality of COVID-19 {Yadav 2021}. 
SI.1.4.1.
Specific complications among hospitalized patients with COVID-19
One study in the UK found renal (24.3%), gastrointestinal (including liver) (10.8%), 
cardiovascular (12.3%), neurological (4.3%) and respiratory (18.4%) as well as systemic (16.3%) 
in-hospital complications among patients {Drake 2021}.
Cardiac issues, such as myocardial injury, viral myocarditis, cardiac injury, heart failure 
arrhythmias, and other issues related to coronary artery disease, are common complications 
among hospitalized patients with COVID-19{Tersalvi 2020, Lalani 2022, Zhao 2021}. The 
frequency of acute cardiac injury ranges from 15% to 33% {Peiris 2022}. Among hospitalized 
patients, myocardial injury (ie, electrocardiographic abnormalities or elevated cardiac troponin 
levels) has been observed in 7.2% to 27.8% and was independently associated with an increased 
rate of in-hospital mortality {Guo 2020, Shi 2020, Wang 2020a}. Cardiomyopathy (33% among 
critically ill patients), arrhythmias (7.4% to 18% among hospitalized patients and 44% among 
ICU patients), shock (7% to 9% among hospitalized patients and 31% among ICU patients), and 
cardiac arrest (14% among critically ill hospitalized patients) have also been reported {Arentz 
2020, Goyal 2020, Huang 2020a, Shi 2020, Wang 2020a}. Cardiac arrest has been attributed not 
only to the virus but also inflammation and systemic illness among ICU patients and is 
associated with in-hospital mortality {Bhatla 2020}. For patients with existing heart disease, 
Page 18
Veklury (Remdesivir)
EU Risk Management Plan
Final
in-hospital mortality was strongly associated with heart failure {CAPACITY-COVID 
Collaborative Consortium and LEOSS Study Group 2022}. SARS-CoV2 down-regulates ACE-2 
expression, which may create a pro-inflammatory environment that can lead to arrhythmias {Ni 
2020}. Myocarditis and pericarditis, which are potential manifestations of the infection, can 
precipitate arrythmias {Varney 2022}. 
The onset of acute kidney injury is a common complication among patients with severe 
SARS-CoV-2 infection and has been associated with increased risk of in-hospital mortality 
compared to those who do not experience AKI during hospitalization {Ng 2020, Robbins-Juarez 
2020}. It has been observed among patients requiring hospitalization (5% to 37%), ICU care 
(23% to 78%) and among fatalities (25% to 50%){Chen 2020b, Cheng 2020, Hirsch 2020, 
Huang 2020a, Pei 2020, Richardson 2020, Wang 2020a, Zhou 2020}. In a meta-analysis, the 
incidence of AKI was estimated to be 17% among cohorts across geographies consisting mostly 
of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, which ranged widely from 0.5 to 80%, likely due to the 
varying proportions of critically ill patients included in each study {Robbins-Juarez 2020}. For 
example, in one study based in New York City, USA, AKI was more frequent among patients 
who experienced respiratory failure, in which 89.7% of patients who required mechanical 
ventilation developed AKI, compared to 21.7% of those who were non-ventilated {Hirsch 2020}. 
Further, proteinuria and hematuria have been reported among COVID-19 patients at the time of 
hospital admission (43.9% to 65.8% and 26.7% to 41.7%, respectively), in addition to elevated 
creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (14.4% and 13.1%, respectively) {Cheng 2020, Pei 2020}. 
Acute kidney injury has a pooled incidence of 12.3% in hospitalized COVID-19 patients {Yang 
2021}. COVID-19-related acute kidney injury is associated with poor disease outcomes and 
higher mortality {Xu 2021}. The cause of renal injury may be glomerulonephritis, thrombotic 
microangiopathy, tubular injury or interstitial nephritis {Farouk 2020}.
Liver injury, characterized broadly by abnormal alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) levels and slightly elevated bilirubin levels, has also been reported 
among 14% to 58% of hospitalized COVID-19 cases {Chen 2020a, Fan 2020, Huang 2020a, 
Huang 2020b, Ponziani 2020, Shi 2020, Wu 2020a, Yang 2020}. Severe acute liver injury 
(>20 times upper limit of normal transaminase levels) are uncommon, occurring in <0.1% of 
infected patients {Sobotka 2022}. In a meta-analysis including over 12,000 COVID-19 patients, 
the overall prevalence of acute kidney injury, elevated AST levels, and elevated ALT levels was 
26.5%, 41.1%, and 29.1%, respectively; and the presence of acute liver injury or elevated 
AST/ALT levels was independently associated with greater odds of negative outcomes, 
including ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital mortality {Sharma 2020}. A 
large, multicenter retrospective study of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in China found the 
median day of acute liver injury occurrence to be day 17 (interquartile range, 13 to 23) among 
the total patient population {Lei 2020}. The study also found that patients with severe 
COVID-19 experienced elevated levels of AST more frequently and to a greater severity 
compared to ALT. The wide ranges of reported liver injury prevalence may also be due to the 
use of different clinical treatments across the various studies, such as steroids and antivirals, 
which may also impact the liver to varying degrees and has not been fully assessed {Xu 2020, 
Yang 2020}. SARS-CoV-2 infection has been associated with an inflammatory cytokine storm, 
which may contribute to hepatologic abnormalities. However, liver injury is most likely 
multifactorial, including immune response, vascular damage and coagulopathy {Dufour 2022}.

Final
Respiratory complications found in hospitalized patients include suspected bacterial pneumonia 
and likely acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) {Drake 2021}. The average incidence of 
stroke in one meta-analysis of COVID-19 patients was 1.74% {Siow 2021}. Case reports and 
case series of cerebral venous thrombosis have also been described {Ghosh 2021}. Delirium is 
found in as many as 55% of hospitalized patients {Pun 2021}. Psychiatric complications are also 
common in hospitalized patients {Steardo 2020}.
Hospitalized patients have developed thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications {Gomez-Mesa 
2021}. Increased inflammatory response, hypoxia, immobilization and disseminated 
intravascular coagulation (DIC) can lead to both venous and arterial thromboembolism {John 
2021}.
COVID-19 infection can precipitate diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state and 
severe insulin resistance {Kim 2020}. 
Changes in hematological indices can be seen in 20-50% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 
who may develop thrombotic and hemorrhagic complications {Gomez-Mesa 2021}. An Italian 
study found venous and arterial thromboembolism in 27.6% of patients in the ICU and 6.6% of 
patients in the general wards {Lodigiani 2020}.
SI.1.4.2.
Specific complications among paediatric patients with COVID-19
Paediatric patients experience similar clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
compared to adult patients, and cases in children are usually mild and many asymptomatic 
{Dong 2020}. In rare cases, however, children may experience severe disease, particularly 
among those with underlying conditions {Wanga 2021}. Symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
among children range from mild to moderate, and although the majority of laboratory confirmed 
cases among children are not severe, cases requiring hospitalization have occurred {Cai 2020, 
Qiu 2020, U. S. Department of Health & Human Services (DHHS) 2020}. Among a sample of 
hospitalized paediatric patients (<18 years) in the US during a period of increased paediatric 
cases due to the Delta variant, approximately 68% had one or more underlying conditions, and 
16% had a viral coinfection, the majority having respiratory syncytial virus {Wanga 2021}. Half 
of these hospitalized paediatric patients received oxygen support, 30% were admitted to the ICU, 
1.1% required extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and 1.5% died.
Clinical manifestations unique to paediatric cases exist, such as multisystem inflammatory 
syndrome in children (MIS-C), a condition with features like Kawasaki disease and toxic shock 
syndrome that occurs two to six weeks after SARS-CoV-2 infection {Belay 2021, Feldstein 
2020}. The case definition of MIS-C varies by geography, but clinical presentation generally 
includes persistent fever with abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhea, skin rash, and/or 
mucocutaneous lesions, evidence of inflammation, multisystem involvement, and no other 
apparent cause of systemic inflammation among paediatric patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection 
{Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2022b, Jiang 2020, World Health 
Organization (WHO) 2020b}. Initial reports of MIS-C emerged in April 2020 from the UK, with 
other global regions, including the Europe, North America, Asia, and Latin America, also 
reporting similar cases since then {Jiang 2020, World Health Organization (WHO) 2020b}. The 
incidence of MIS-C is rare, and estimates range from approximately 5.1 to 20 per 1,000,000 
Page 20
Veklury (Remdesivir)
EU Risk Management Plan
Final
persons younger than 21 years {Dufort 2020, Payne 2021}. Studies in the UK and US have 
found 60-79% of MIS-C patients are admitted to the ICU, and 1-3.5% die {Bowen 2021, Davies 
2020, Feldstein 2020, Jiang 2020, Radia 2021, Swann 2020}.
SI.1.4.3.
Mortality
As of 09 October 2022, there have been over 6.5 million cumulative deaths reported globally, 
with the highest percentage being reported from the WHO region of the Americas (43%), 
followed by Europe (32%), South-east Asia (12%), Eastern Mediterranean (5%), Western Pacific 
(4%), and Africa (3%) {World Health Organization (WHO) 2022b}. In the EU/EEA, the 14-day 
death rate due to COVID-19 (based on official reporting from 30 countries) as of 
09 October 2022 was 7.3 deaths per million population, ranging from 0 (Iceland and 
Liechtenstein) to 35.9 (Latvia) per million across all reporting countries {European Centre for 
Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) 2022b}.
Reported measures of mortality due to COVID-19 vary geographically due to differing 
population demographics and early mitigation response. Case fatality ratios, defined as the 
percentage of individuals with symptomatic or confirmed COVID-19 who die from the disease, 
have been estimated using various statistical modeling methods among different patient cohorts. 
There is also strong evidence for increased mortality among older age groups. In an analysis 
adjusting for demographic characteristics and under-ascertainment of cases, the age-specific case 
fatality ratios in China were estimated to be 0.32%, 6.4%, and 13.4% among those 60 years and 
younger, greater than 60 years old, and 80 years and older, respectively {Verity 2020}. 
Estimates from the same study for cases occurring outside of China also showed the same trend. 
In EU/EEA countries, higher crude case-fatality rates are observed with increasing age among 
cases reported, where 1% of diagnosed cases aged 59 and younger are fatal, 2% of those aged 
60 to 69 years, 7.4% of those aged 70 to 79 years, and 19% of those 80 years and 
older{European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) 2021c}.
There is no evidence of increased in-hospital mortality due to SARS-CoV-2 infection among 
pregnant women {Hsu 2022, Leung 2022}. However, higher rates of maternal mortality among 
pregnant people with SARS-CoV-2 infection who were admitted to or received care at a hospital 
for any reason have been observed in upper-middle-income countries and the Latin America and 
Caribbean region {Sheikh 2022}.
SI.1.5.
Important Co-morbidities

preexisting health conditions, increased risk of hospitalization, severe disease and/or death due to 
COVID-19 has been identified among patients with the following co-morbidities.

SPECIFICATION

Table of Key Safety Findings from Nonclinical Studies
Key Safety Findings (from Nonclinical Studies)
Relevance to Human Use
Although the kidney was identified as the only 
target organ of toxicity in nonclinical studies, the 
available clinical data do not suggest a 
confirmed renal safety signal. 
Renal findings
Following repeated dosing in rats and monkeys, the kidney was 
identified as the only target organ of toxicity. In the repeat dose 
studies with remdesivir (RDV), toxicity findings were consistent 
with dose-dependent and reversible kidney injury and dysfunction 
at doses greater than 3 mg/kg/day in rats and 5 mg/kg/day in rhesus 
monkeys. There were no observable kidney changes in cynomolgus 
monkeys administered intravenous (IV) RDV at 10 mg/kg/day.
In rats, clinical chemistry and urinalysis findings, including 
increases in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine, and increases 
in urinary biomarkers of kidney injury, eg, total protein, 
n-acetyl-glucosaminidase, cystatin C, beta-2-microglobulin, and 
kidney injury molecule-1, were predictive of the microscopic 
changes observed in the kidney. Microscopic findings included a 
spectrum of degenerative, necrotic and regenerative changes to the 
renal tubular epithelium in the cortex. In the 2-week study 
(TX-399-2003), the changes in the kidney were reversible after a 
4-week recovery period and correlated with the reversibility of the 
clinical chemistry, urinalysis and urinary biomarker findings. In the 
4-week toxicity study (TX-399-2016), the no observed adverse 
effect level (NOAEL) was 3 mg/kg/day, based on the nature and 
severity of the kidney changes at the 10 mg/kg/day dose level. 
The sensitivity of rats to renal effects of RDV may be related to the 
active tubular transport of RDV metabolites by rat renal organic 
anion transporter-3 (OAT3); this interaction has not been detected 
with human renal OAT3 (PC-399-2020).
In cynomolgus monkeys administered RDV via daily IV (slow 
bolus) injection for up to 4 weeks, there were no changes indicative 
of an effect in the kidney, and the NOAEL was the high dose of 
10 mg/kg/day (TX-399-2017). After daily intramuscular (IM) 
injections of 15 mg/kg/day GS-466547 (diastereomeric mixture) to 
cynomolgus monkeys, similar microscopic changes were observed 
in the proximal tubules of the kidney to those noted in rats; 
clinical pathology changes correlated with the renal changes at the 
15 mg/kg/day IM dose (TX-399-2001). Exposures at the NOAEL in 
the 7-day IM-study were slightly higher than at the NOAEL in the 
4-week IV study. In a 7-day IV study in (Indian-origin) rhesus 
monkeys, adverse kidney changes were observed at ≥ 5 mg/kg/day, 
with mortality noted in 1 animal administered 20 mg/kg/day 
(TX-399-2021). The reason for the possible increased sensitivity of 
rhesus monkeys compared to cynomolgus monkeys is unknown.

Key Safety Findings (from Nonclinical Studies)
Relevance to Human Use
Hepatic findings
In the nonclinical program, there were no changes in the liver in 
rats or monkeys based on clinical chemistry parameters, liver 
weight, or microscopic observations.
Data from in vitro studies with liver cell culture systems (m2.6.6, 
Section 9.3.1) demonstrated that human hepatocytes are more 
susceptible to toxicity from RDV than from its metabolites 
GS-704277 and GS-441524, likely due to high cellular permeability 
and effective intracellular metabolism of the drug. 
While GS-704277 and GS-441524 are in vivo metabolites, and can 
be readily detected in plasma, these metabolites are unlikely to 
contribute significantly to changes in liver enzymes observed in 
humans administered repeated doses of RDV due to their low 
toxicity on hepatocytes observed in vitro.
Genotoxicity
Remdesivir and the nucleoside metabolite, GS-441524, were 
non-mutagenic in the in vitro Ames mutagenicity assay 
(TX-399-2005 and TX-195-2006, respectively), and RDV was 
negative in the rat micronucleus assay (TX-399-2003). In the 
in vitro chromosome aberrations assay with human lymphocytes, 
RDV was negative without metabolic activation, and equivocal in 
the 3-hour treatment with metabolic activation (TX-399-2006).
Carcinogenicity
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted.
In clinical studies with RDV in healthy subjects, 
transient elevations in ALT and AST have been 
observed with single doses of RDV up to 
225 mg and multiple once-daily doses of RDV 
150 mg for up to 14 days, with mild, reversible 
prothrombin time (PT) prolongation in some 
subjects but without any clinically relevant 
change in international normalized ratio (INR) 
or other evidence of hepatic effects.
In 2 placebo-controlled clinical studies in 
patients with COVID-19, liver-related AEs were 
reported at a lower or similar incidence for RDV 
versus placebo {Beigel 2020a, Beigel 2020b, 
Wang 2020b}.
Remdesivir is nongenotoxic.
Current regulatory guidance does not require 
carcinogenicity studies with RDV for the 
COVID-19 indication with a dosing duration of 
less than 3 months.
Effects on respiratory, Central Nervous System (CNS), and cardiovascular systems
The potential for CNS, respiratory, or 
cardiovascular effects is considered low.
Safety pharmacology studies were conducted to examine the 
potential effects of RDV on the respiratory, CNS, and 
cardiovascular systems after IV administration (PC-399-2004, 
PC-399-2003, and PC-399-2005, respectively). In a respiratory 
safety study in rats, RDV had no effect on tidal volume or minute 
volume; however, respiration rates were transiently increased in 
animals administered ≥ 20 mg/kg and returned to control levels by 
24 hours postdose, resulting in a NOEL for respiratory function in 
male rats of 5 mg/kg, at exposures approximately 2.2-fold above 
the GS-441524 Cmax at the 200 mg clinical dose. Remdesivir had no 
effect on the CNS of rats and no effect on cardiovascular 
parameters in monkeys. At the CNS NOEL of 50 mg/kg, exposures 
in rats were approximately 19-fold above the GS-441524 Cmax at 
the 200-mg clinical dose. At the cardiovascular NOEL of 10 mg/kg, 
exposures in monkeys were approximately 0.3-fold and 2.7-fold for 
RDV and GS-441524, respectively, compared to the respective Cmax 
values at the 200-mg clinical dose. The lack of in vivo 
cardiovascular effect is consistent with the weak in vitro inhibition 
of the hERG channel by RDV (IC50 28.9 μM) and GS-441524 and 
GS-704277 (IC50’s > 30 μM).

Key Safety Findings (from Nonclinical Studies)
Relevance to Human Use
Local Tolerance
Remdesivir is intended for IV administration. In the repeat-dose 
studies, injection site reactions, such as red discoloration, were 
observed in rats. There were no similar reactions in monkeys. 
Remdesivir is not an irritant to skin, was classified as non-irritant to 
eyes, and is unlikely to be phototoxic based on the absence of 
binding to melanin-containing tissues (AD-399-2017), and its 
photochemical properties.
Infusion site reactions are not considered a 
safety concern for RDV due to the low 
frequency (<1%) and low grade of the events 
(mostly grade 1/2) reported in Studies 
GS-US-540-5773 and GS-US-540-5774.
Hypersensitivity including infusion-related 
reactions are noted in the SmPC.
No reproductive or developmental effects are 
anticipated. It is unknown if RDV or its 
metabolites are excreted in human milk.
The decreases in corpora lutea, and consequent 
decreases in implantation sites and viable 
embryos, are considered a consequence of 
stress/maternal toxicity at this dose level in rats. 
The female rodent is fairly sensitive to agents 
that cause decreased body weight gain and 
reduced food intake (negative energy balance) 
and respond with decreased weights of ovary, 
uterus, and cervix and reduced ovarian follicles 
and corpora lutea {Everds 2012, Rudmann 
2013}. These findings can be expected to be 
fully reversible in animals. In the absence of 
significant toxicity to the patient (eg, severe 
weight loss), these changes in the fertility study 
in female rats are not considered clinically 
relevant at the doses to be administered to 
humans, and by inference, the potential effects 
on patients are not considered clinically relevant.
The overall potential for interactions is currently 
unknown; patients should remain under close 
observation during the days of remdesivir 
administration.
Reproductive & Developmental Effects
A complete reproductive and development toxicity program has 
been completed with RDV. There were no effects on embryofetal 
development in rats and rabbits, and the NOAELs were 
20 mg/kg/day in both species. There were no adverse effects in the 
pre- and postnatal toxicity study in rats, and the NOAEL was 
10 mg/kg/day. There were no effects on male reproductive 
performance and spermatogenesis, and the NOAEL for male 
reproductive toxicity was 10 mg/kg/day. For females the NOAEL 
for reproductive toxicity and embryonic toxicity was 3 mg/kg/day, 
based on decreases in corpora lutea, numbers of implantation sites 
and viable embryos at the 10 mg/kg/day dose associated with 
systemic maternal toxicity.
Remdesivir and/or its metabolites were detected in the plasma of 
nursing pups likely due to the presence of RDV and/or its 
metabolites in milk.
Drug-drug interaction liability assessment
The liability for RDV to cause pharmacokinetic (PK) drug 
interactions was assessed using current Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) Guidelines (AD-540-2006) and 
representative clinical PK data. In vitro, remdesivir is a weak 
inhibitor of cytochrome 3A4 (CYP3A4), organic anion transporting 
polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), OATP1B3, bile salt export pump 
(BSEP), multidrug resistance-associated protein 4 (MRP4), and 
sodium-taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (NTCP). The 
clinical relevance of these in vitro drug assessments has not been 
established. Remdesivir may transiently increase plasma 
concentrations of medicinal products that are substrates of CYP3A 
or OATP 1B1/1B3. The inhibitory effects are weak and, due to the 
short half-life of RDV, the effects would only be manifest briefly. 
Further evaluation of GS-704277 and GS-441524 for possible 
interactions with drug metabolizing enzymes and transporters is 
ongoing.
In vitro, remdesivir is a substrate for drug metabolizing enzymes 
CYP2C8, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, and is a substrate for OATP1B1 
and P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporters. The use of strong inducers of 
P-gp (eg, rifampicin) that may decrease plasma concentrations of 
remdesivir is not recommended.

Key Safety Findings (from Nonclinical Studies)
Relevance to Human Use
Antagonism with chloroquine phosphate
The antiviral activity of remdesivir was antagonized by chloroquine 
phosphate in a dose-dependent manner when the two drugs were 
co-incubated at clinically relevant concentrations in HEp-2 cells 
infected with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Higher remdesivir 
EC50 values were observed with increasing concentrations of 
chloroquine phosphate. Increasing concentrations of chloroquine 
phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulphate reduced formation of 
remdesivir triphosphate in A549-hACE2, HEp-2, and normal 
human bronchial epithelial cells.
Due to potential antagonism based on in vitro 
observations, concomitant use of remdesivir with 
chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine 
sulphate is not recommended.

use program, 21 were included 
in Study GS-US-540-5773 and 
GS-US-540-5774, 3 were 
included in Study 
GS-US-540-9012, 53 were 
included in GS-US-540-5823
No
Rationale:
Removal of the missing information Safety 
in patients with severe renal impairment as 
there are no outstanding additional 
pharmacovigilance activities following the 
completion of Studies GS-US-540-5912 
and GS-US-540-9015.
The safety profile of RDV, metabolites and 
excipients in patients with severe renal 
impairment is generally safe and well 
tolerated.
No
Rationale:
The safety profile in adolescents aged 12 to 
< 18 years is not anticipated to differ from 
that in adults.
Paediatric patients of at least 4 weeks of age 
and >3 kg are included in the indication.
a
Subsequent amendments to the compassionate use program allow pregnant women to receive remdesivir.

Potential Risks
Hepatotoxicity
Nephrotoxicity
Risk-Benefit Impact
In Phase 1 studies in healthy participants, low-grade and transient increases in transaminases 
were observed, which were not associated with hepatic AEs. In the context of COVID-19, 
hepatic safety appears comparable between RDV and placebo or standard of care (SOC) based 
on the safety data from controlled studies {Beigel 2020a, Beigel 2020b, Wang 2020b} 
(Study GS-US-540-5774).
Evaluation of hepatic events from Study GS-US-540-5773 and the compassionate use 
cohort (IN-US-540-5755) consistently demonstrates that Grade 3 and above hepatic AEs 
occurred either in the context of clinical deterioration from COVID-19, involved 
concomitant use of medications associated with hepatic adverse reactions, or involved 
laboratory abnormalities that peaked and then decreased while RDV was continued. 
Limited patient-level data are currently available from the placebo-controlled studies to 
fully exclude this potential risk {Beigel 2020a, Beigel 2020b, Wang 2020b}.
The kidney was identified as the only target organ of toxicity in nonclinical studies. In the 
context of COVID-19, renal safety appears comparable between RDV and placebo or SOC 
based on the safety data from controlled studies {Beigel 2020a, Beigel 2020b, Wang 2020b} 
(Study GS-US-540-5774).
Evaluation of renal-related AEs from Study GS-US-540-5773 and the compassionate use cohort 
(IN-US-540-5755) consistently demonstrated that renal AEs occurred in the context of clinical 
deterioration from COVID-19 or concomitant use of medications associated with renal adverse 
effects. Limited patient-level data are currently available from the placebo-controlled studies to 
fully exclude this potential risk {Beigel 2020a, Beigel 2020b, Wang 2020b}.

Missing 
Information
Safety in patients 
with hepatic 
impairment
Safety in patients 
with severe renal 
impairment
Risk-Benefit Impact
It is not known if the PK of RDV and its metabolite(s) is affected by hepatic impairment as 
RDV has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment. The relevance of the 
low-grade and transient increases in transaminases observed in healthy participants in 
Phase 1 studies is unknown in patients with hepatic impairment.
It is not known if the PK of RDV and its metabolite(s) is affected by severe renal 
impairment as no studies have been conducted in patients with severe renal impairment. 
The safety of the excipient betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium is unknown in COVID-19 
patients with severe renal impairment; betadex sulfobutyl ether sodium is renally cleared 
and accumulates in patients with decreased renal function.
Safety in pregnant 
and lactating 
women
The safety of RDV in pregnant women and lactating women is unknown as no studies have 
been conducted in pregnant women and it is not known whether RDV is excreted in human 
milk and effects the breast-fed infant.
SVII.2.
New Safety Concerns and Reclassification with a Submission of an updated 
RMP
No new safety concerns have been identified or reclassified since the submission of the last 
RMP.
Safety in patients with hepatic impairment previously classified as missing information is 
removed from the list of safety concerns. The rationale for the removal is that there are no 
outstanding additional PV activities for this safety concern. The Category 3 additional PV 
activity Study GS-US-540-9014 has been completed.

Specific Adverse Reaction Follow-up Questionnaires
Name of Questionnaire
Description
Postmarketing pregnancy report form
Postmarketing pregnancy outcome report 
form
The questionnaire is designed to obtain information including maternal 
profile, maternal risk factors, contraception, previous pregnancies, 
medications used on current pregnancy, prenatal test, paternal details, 
male partner medical history, and medication used at time of conception.
The questionnaire is designed to obtain information including maternal 
details, course and outcome of pregnancy, comedications, characteristics 
of baby (general appearance, clinical condition, follow-up examination, 
test/procedures for baby/fetus).
Monitoring of data on treatment failure due to emerging variants
As requested by Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee (PRAC), as part of the 
enhanced signal detection activities for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, data on 
treatment failure due to emerging variants will be monitored from all available data sources, 
including but not limited to:
• Nonclinical data (antiviral activity and viral resistance) on new emerging variant of concerns 
or variant of interest (as defined by the WHO or ECDC)
• Spontaneous reports (retrieved by using Standardized Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities Queries Lack of efficacy/effect)
• Literature reports
• Marketing authorisation holder´s and partners clinical trial data
• Studies conducted by public health authorities
Cumulative data from the review will be summarized in a dedicated section of the PSUR. A 
dedicated paragraph will be included to present data from immunocompromised patients with the 
treatment duration of three days as there is a concern of potential development of viral resistance. 
If the review of the data leads to an impact on the benefit risk profile of RDV, appropriate 
variation (including the data, a benefit-risk discussion and any warranted product information 
updates) will be submitted to the agency within one month.

Gilead has in place a general Business Continuity Plan (BCP) and annexed to this is a pandemic 
specific BCP setting forth the principles by which Gilead responds to increasing demand and/or 
decreasing capacity of its Pharmacovigilance (PV) system through active prioritization with a 
focus on critical products and key PV activities. At the same time and in order to manage 
through the pandemic and resource restraint situations without compromising compliance overall 
capacity enhancement and resource expansion is a key element of the preparedness and business

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN
SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR VEKLURY (REMDESIVIR)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Veklury. The RMP details important 
risks of Veklury, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained 
about Veklury risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Veklury’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Veklury should be used.
This summary of the RMP for Veklury should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Veklury’s 
RMP.
I.
The Medicine and What is it Used for
Veklury is indicated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in:
•
•
adults and paediatric patients (at least 4 weeks of age and weighing at least 3 kg) with
pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen (low- or high-flow oxygen or other non-invasive
ventilation at start of treatment).
adults and paediatric patients (weighing at least 40 kg) who do not require supplemental
oxygen and who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID-19 (see SmPC for the
full indication).
It contains remdesivir as the active substance and it is given by intravenous infusion.
Further information about the evaluation of Veklury’s benefits can be found in Veklury’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s 
webpage: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/veklury.
II.
Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimize or Further
Characterize the Risks
Important risks of Veklury, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Veklury’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
• Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Page 51
Veklury (Remdesivir)
EU Risk Management Plan
Final
•
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
• The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly;
• The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analyzed including periodic safety update report (PSUR) assessment so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.
If important information that may affect the safe use of Veklury is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A.
List of important risks and missing information
Important risks are risks that need special risk management activities to further investigate or 
minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important risks can 
be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient 
proof of a link with the use of Veklury. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with 
the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been 
established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the 
safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the 
long-term use of the medicine).

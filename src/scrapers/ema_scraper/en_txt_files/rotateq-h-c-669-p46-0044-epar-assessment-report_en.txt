Introduction 
On 15 January 2016, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study Prot. No. 035, in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development programme 
The MAH stated that the study, entitled: 
•  A Double-Blind, Randomized, Controlled, Multicentre Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, 
and Immunogenicity of a New Formulation of RotaTeq™ 
is a standalone study. 
1.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the studies 
The pharmaceutical formulation used in the studies was an oral solution. RotaTeq (Rotavirus vaccine, 
Live, Oral, Pentavalent) is administered as a 2 mL solution per dose for oral administration for both 
groups. The vaccine is contained in a single-dose plastic tube. Each dose of study vaccine (new or 
current formulation of RotaTeq™) consisted of a 2-mL, oral solution of 5 live human-bovine reassortant 
rotaviruses which contains a minimum of 2.0 to 2.8 x 106 infectious units (IU) per reassortant dose, 
depending on the serotype, and not greater than 116 x 106 IU per aggregate dose. 
1.3.  Clinical aspects 
1.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
•  V260-035; NCT01600092 A Double-Blind, Randomized, Controlled, Multicentre Study to  
Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of a New Formulation of RotaTeq™ 
The current formulation of RotaTeq™ must be stored at 2 to 8°C for the duration of its shelf-life (24 
months). While there are some allowances for temperature excursions, the vaccine is unstable at 
temperatures >25°C. A more thermostable formulation of RotaTeq™, referred to as New Formulation 
(also referred to as the “Vaccine Vial Monitor Compatible [VVMC] formulation”), has been developed 
and used in the clinical study protocol (V260-035; NCT01600092). This new formulation of RotaTeq™ 
has the ability to meet the stability requirements of an existing Vaccine Vial Monitor (VVM). The new 
formulation of RotaTeq™ also has increased shelf-life of 3 years.

Description 
Methods 
Objectives 
Primary Objective:  
To summarize and compare the vaccine-induced serum neutralizing antibody (SNA) to human rotavirus 
serotypes G1, G2, G3, G4, and P1A[8] at 42 days post dose 3 between recipients of the new 
formulation and recipients of the current formulation of RotaTeq™. 
Secondary Objectives: 
 (1) To assess the safety and tolerability of the new formulation of RotaTeq™.  
(2) To summarize the geometric mean titres (GMTs) of vaccine-induced serum anti-rotavirus IgA at 
42 days post dose 3 in recipients of the new formulation and recipients of the current formulation of 
RotaTeq™.  
(3) To summarize the proportion of subjects with a ≥3-fold rise in SNA titre against human rotavirus 
serotypes G1, G2, G3, G4, and P1A[8] as well as antibody titre for serum anti-rotavirus IgA from 
baseline to 42 days post dose 3 in recipients of the new formulation and recipients of the current 
formulation of RotaTeq™. 
Study design 
This was a double-blind, randomized, controlled, multicentre trial to primarily demonstrate the non-
inferiority of the new formulation of RotaTeq™ relative to the current formulation of RotaTeq™ on the 
basis of immunogenicity. The primary purpose of the study was to demonstrate the noninferiority of 
the new formulation of RotaTeq™ when compared with the current formulation of RotaTeq™ on the 
basis of immunogenicity. 
Study population /Sample size 
Approximately 924 healthy, eligible infants between 6 and 12 weeks of age (42 to 84 days) at receipt 
of the first study vaccination (Date of Birth is age Day 1) A total of 462 subjects per vaccination group 
were to be enrolled and vaccinated in the study.  
Treatments 
Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 vaccination groups: new formulation of RotaTeq™ and 
current formulation of RotaTeq™. Each subject received a total of three 2- mL oral doses of study 
vaccine. The first dose was administered between 6 and 12 weeks (42 to 84 days) of age and the third 
dose was administered before 32 weeks of age or per local regulation. Each dose of study vaccine was 
separated by a minimum of 4 weeks (28 days). 
Other approved routine paediatric vaccines (such as diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular 
pertussis (DTaP) vaccine, inactivated poliovirus vaccine [IPV], hepatitis B vaccine [HBV],  
pneumococcal conjugate vaccines and Haemophilus influenzae type b [Hib] conjugate vaccines) could 
have been administered during the study per country and study site practice.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Immunogenicity Endpoints 
Primary immunogenicity endpoint 
The primary immunogenicity endpoints were the SNA titres to human rotavirus serotype G1, G2, G3, 
G4, and P1A[8] included in the vaccine.  
Secondary immunogenicity endpoints 
The secondary immunogenicity endpoints included serum anti-rotavirus IgA, and proportion of subjects  
with a ≥3-fold rise from baseline for SNA to human rotavirus serotypes G1, G2, G3, G4, and P1A[8], as  
well as for serum anti-rotavirus IgA. 
 Safety Endpoints 
Safety endpoints included incidence of AEs collected for 42 days following each dose. In addition, all 
SAEs regardless of causality, all deaths, and any cases of intussusception (ECI) were to be reported 
from the time of consent until the end of the entire study. 
Statistical Methods 
Immunogenicity: 
For non-inferiority regarding the geometric mean titres (GMTs) for all 5 immunogenicity endpoints, the 
GMT ratio and associated 95% CI were calculated from a constrained longitudinal data analysis (cLDA) 
method proposed by Liang and Zeger [Ref. 5.4: 03QK6K] on the log-transformed baseline and post-
vaccination titre values. This analysis was adjusted for country and baseline titres and used all 
available data at both baseline and post vaccination. 
Success criteria required that the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (CI) of the GMT ratio be 
>0.67 (corresponding to a no more than 1.5-fold decrease in the GMT of the [New] VVMC formulation 
compared with the current formulation). The primary immunogenicity endpoints were the SNA titres to 
human rotavirus serotype G1, G2, G3, G4, and P1A[8] included in the vaccine. The secondary 
immunogenicity endpoints included serum anti-rotavirus IgA, and proportion of subjects with a ≥3-fold 
rise from baseline for SNA to human rotavirus serotypes G1, G2, G3, G4, and P1A[8], as well as for 
serum antirotavirus IgA.  
The per-protocol (PP) population served as the primary population for the immunogenicity analysis in 
this study. The PP population is defined as subjects who received the 3 scheduled doses of study 
vaccine, adhered to guidelines for the administration of the study vaccine, and did not have important 
deviations from the protocol that would substantially affect the results of the primary immunogenicity 
endpoints. Analyses and summaries of Post dose 3 assay values included subjects who had Post dose 3 
assay results. The final determination of protocol violations and thereby the composition of PP 
population was made prior to the final unblinding of the database. A supportive immunogenicity 
summary and analysis were done on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) population that included all 
randomized subjects with available serology data, for each serology time point for all endpoints 
associated with the primary hypothesis. Subjects were included in the vaccine group to which they 
were randomized for immunogenicity analyses.

Safety: 
Statistical analysis followed a tiered approach to evaluate the safety data. The tiers differed with 
respect to the analyses that were performed. Safety parameters or AEs of special interest that are 
identified a priori constitute “Tier 1” safety endpoints that were subject to inferential testing for 
statistical significance with p-values. 
For Tier 1 safety endpoints analysis, 95% CI was used for between-group comparisons. Other safety 
parameters were included in Tier 2 or Tier 3. Tier 2 parameters were assessed via point estimates with 
95% CIs provided for between-group comparisons. Only point estimates by vaccine group were 
provided for Tier 3 safety parameters. P-values and 95% CI for the percentage differences between 
the 2 vaccine groups were calculated using the Miettinen and Nurminen method. AEs (specific terms as 
well as system organ class terms) that were not prespecified as Tier 1 endpoints, were classified as 
belonging to "Tier 2" or "Tier 3", based on the number of events observed. Tier 2 included only AEs 
which were exhibited by at least 4 subjects in any vaccine group. All other AEs belonged to Tier 3. The 
threshold of at least 4 events was chosen because the 95% CI would not show a statistically significant 
difference between the 2 vaccine groups if the events were <4 in each vaccine group. For safety 
evaluation, all statistical tests were conducted at the α = 0.05 (2-sided) level, unless otherwise stated. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Of the 1039 subjects screened, 1020 subjects were randomized (513 in the New formulation group and 
507 in the current formulation group). Inability to obtain blood specimen at randomization was the 
most common reason for subjects not randomized (n=12).   
Of the 1020 subjects randomized, 1014 subjects received at least 1 dose of study vaccine. The 6 
randomized subjects who were not vaccinated included 3 subjects who were determined by the 
investigator to be screen failures and 3 subjects who were withdrawn by his/her parent/legal guardian 
prior to study vaccination. Overall, 98% of the subjects completed the 3 dose vaccination series. The 
number (%) of subjects discontinued from the study was  low (<3%) and were similar in the 2 
vaccination groups. The most common reason for study  discontinuation was parent withdrew consent 
(1.4%). Details in summarised in Table 1 and baseline  characteristics in Table 2.

Efficacy results 
Primary Immunogenicity Analyses 
The primary immunogenicity analyses and summaries of Post dose 3 assay values included subjects 
who had Post dose 3 assay results (per-protocol population). The results of the primary 
immunogenicity analysis are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. The primary immunogenicity hypothesis 
was met for all 5 serotypes, and therefore non-inferiority with respect to immunogenicity can be 
asserted for the VVMC formulation of RotaTeq™ as compared to the current formulation of RotaTeq™. 
Of note, the GMT for G3 was higher in the VVMC formulation group compared to the current 
formulation group. 
A per-protocol summary of SNA responses to serotypes G1, G2, G3, G4 and P1A measured Predose 1 
and ~42 days Post dose 3 is provided for both vaccine groups in Table 4.

The observed GMTs and proportion of subjects with a ≥3-fold rise of rotavirus SNA to serotypes G1, 
G2, G3, G4 and P1A from baseline to ~42 days Post dose 3, as well as the associated 95% CI are also 
shown in Table 4. At baseline, the GMTs were comparable between the vaccine groups across all 
serotypes. Post dose 3, the VVMC formulation group had a higher GMT response for serotype G3, and 
the 95% CI and proportion of subjects with a 3-fold rise did not overlap between the 2 vaccine groups. 
For the other serotypes (G1, G2, G4, P1A), the 95% CIs for GMTs and proportion of subjects with a ≥3-
fold rise were comparable between the 2 vaccine groups Post dose 3.

Secondary Immunogenicity Analyses 
The secondary immunogenicity analyses of serum anti-rotavirus IgA measured Predose 1 and 42 days 
Post dose 3 are shown in Table 5. This PP analysis showed that GMTs of serum anti-rotavirus IgA from 
Day 1-42 days Post dose 3 in the 2 vaccine groups were comparable. Though the proportion of 
subjects with a ≥3-fold rise of serum anti-rotavirus IgA in the VVMC formulation group (97.3%) was 
numerically higher than in the current formulation group (95.2%), the two 95% CIs overlapped.  
Table 5 
 Supportive Immunogenicity Analyses 
Immunogenicity analysis of the non-inferiority of GMT for the SNA responses to reassortants rotavirus 
serotypes G1, G2, G3, G4 and P1A were done in FAS population also. 
The method used for this analysis was the same as that used for the primary PP analysis of non-
inferiority of GMTs for the SNA responses to reassortant rotavirus serotypes G1, G2, G3, G4 and P1A. 
The FAS results indicate that the statistical criterion for non-inferiority was met for all 5 serotypes, 
which was consistent with the results from the primary PP analysis. 
The FAS for the measurement of SNA responses to serotypes G1, G2, G3, G4 and P1A and serum anti-
rotavirus IgA were also done Predose 1 and ~42 days Post dose 3 for both vaccine groups. Consistent 
with the PP analysis, results for serotype G3 were higher in the VVMC formulation group and the 95% 
CI for GMTs Post dose 3 and the proportion of subjects with a ≥3-fold rise did not overlap with that of 
the current formulation. For the other serotypes (G1, G2, G4, P1A) and IgA, the 95% CIs for GMTs and 
proportion of subjects with a ≥3-fold rise were comparable between the 2 vaccine groups [Ref. 5.3.5.1: 
P035]. 
Safety:  
The safety objective for this study was to assess the safety and tolerability of the VVMC formulation of 
RotaTeq™. All adverse events (AEs, nonserious and serious) regardless of causality were collected for 
42 days following each study vaccine dose. In addition, all SAEs regardless of causality and any cases 
of intussusception (Event of Clinical Interest [ECI]) were reported from the time of consent until the 
end of entire study (defined as the last scheduled visit of the last subject enrolled in the study). At 
each vaccination visit, the parent/legal guardian received a vaccine report card (VRC) which prompted 
for recording of AEs of special interest which included the subject’s temperature, presence of vomiting, 
and/or diarrhoea daily for 7 days post-vaccination. The VRC also collected any other AEs, as well as 
concomitant medications and concomitant vaccinations for 42 days post-vaccination. Intensity/severity 
(mild, moderate, or severe) were collected for all AEs. “Mild” was defined as an awareness of symptom 
in the subject, but easily tolerated; “moderate” was defined as subject definitely acting like something 
was wrong; and “severe” was defined as the subject appearing 
RotaTeq P46 117 
Rev04.14

extremely distressed or unable to do usual activities. Stool samples (~5 grams) were collected for 
subjects who experienced moderate-to-severe diarrhoea and/or vomiting (defined as 3 or more looser-
than-normal stools in 24 hours, 1 watery stool in 24 hours, and/or forceful vomiting) within 14 days of 
study vaccination for rotavirus testing. If positive for rotavirus, further testing was done to characterize 
any strains identified by genotype. 
Safety Evaluation and Results 
The safety evaluation was based on the ASaT (All Subjects as Treated) population, which included all 
randomized subjects who received at least 1 vaccine dose and who had safety follow-up. For the 
analysis of safety data, subjects were included in the vaccine group corresponding to the vaccine that 
they actually received. For most subjects, this group was the vaccine group to which they were 
randomized. 
Of the 1014 subjects vaccinated in this study, 510 subjects were randomized to the VVMC formulation 
of RotaTeq™, and 504 subjects to the current formulation of RotaTeq™. After adjusting for subjects 
who were cross-treated and therefore included in the group corresponding to the study vaccine they 
received at Day 1/Dose 1, there were a total of 509 and 505 subjects included in the VVMC formulation 
and current formulation groups, respectively, for the safety analysis based on the ASaT population. 
The statistical analysis of clinical AEs that occurred after any study vaccination showed that the VVMC 
formulation group and current formulation group had comparable safety profiles Table 6. In the VVMC 
formulation group, 86.4% of subjects (439/508) reported 1 or more AE compared to 87.8% of subjects 
(438/499) in the current formulation group during Day 1 to Day 42 following any vaccination. Overall, 
51% of the subjects in both vaccine groups reported a vaccine-related AE and the distribution of AEs 
was generally similar between the 2 vaccine groups. The incidence of SAEs any time after vaccination 
for the entire study period was low (3.9% in the VVMC formulation group and 2.4% in the current 
formulation group). There were no deaths and no vaccine-related SAEs in this study. 
A total of 2 subjects discontinued the study as a result of an SAE. Both subjects were in the VVMC 
formulation group and both discontinued due to intussusception.

Analysis of Overall Adverse Events 
The analysis of subjects with AEs (incidence ≥4 subjects in one or more vaccination groups) by system 
organ class (SOC) Days 1 to 42 following any vaccination is shown in Table 7. Overall, 87% of the 
subjects reported 1 or more AEs from days 1 to 42 following any vaccination. The proportion of 
subjects reporting specific AEs were comparable between the 2 vaccine groups. The most common AE 
in the [New] VVMC formulation vs. current formulation of vaccine groups respectively were diarrhoea 
(33.9% vs. 31.1%), pyrexia (29.5% vs. 30.3%), vomiting (20.1% vs. 21.2%), nasopharyngitis 
(14.8% vs. 15.0%), upper respiratory tract infection (15.4% vs. 13.2%), and irritability (12.8% vs. 
15.4%). The majority of the AEs reported were of mild-to-moderate intensity. The frequency of AEs 
was generally similar between the 2 vaccine groups; the incidence of dermatitis and urticaria was 
greater in the VVMC formulation group. The difference in percentage between the VVMC and current 
formulation groups was 1.6% (95% CI: 0.1, 3.3) for dermatitis and 1.2% (95% CI: 0.1, 2.6) for 
urticaria, respectively.

 Vaccine-Related Adverse Events 
The analysis of number (%) of subjects with AEs (incidence ≥2%) - overall and vaccine-related, by 
SOC and preferred terms, showed that 51% of the subjects reported 1 or more AEs Days 1 to 42 
following any vaccination that were considered vaccine-related by the investigator. The most common 
vaccine-related AE in the VVMC formulation vaccine group vs. current formulation vaccine group were 
diarrhoea (26.0% vs. 22.8%), pyrexia (16.9% vs. 16.2%), and vomiting (13.8% vs. 14.4%) 
respectively. The proportion of subjects reporting specific vaccine-related AEs were comparable 
between the 2 vaccine groups. 
Serious adverse events  
In Protocol 035-02, all SAEs regardless of causality were collected from the time of consent until the 
end of the study. Prior clinical trials of RotaTeq collected SAEs for 42 days or 14 days post-vaccination. 
To assist in the interpretation of the SAE data from this study, the SAE by SOC table is presented by 
day ranges (Days 1 to 14, Days 1 to 42, and anytime post vaccination) in Table 8. The most common 
SAE was bronchiolitis [3 (0.6%) in the VVMC formulation and 1 (0.2%) in the current formulation 
group]. 
There were no vaccine-related SAEs reported in this study. 
There were no AEs that led to death during this study.

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Daily temperatures, diarrhoea, and vomiting were solicited for 7 days after each study vaccination in 
this study. There were no statistically significant differences in any of the AEs of Special Interest 
between the 2 vaccine groups (Table 9). 
Intussusception was considered an ECI for this study. All cases of intussusception were to be reported 
for the duration of the study. There were 2 cases of intussusception reported in this study, both in the 
RotaTeq P46 117 
Rev04.14 
Page 14/17 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
VVMC formulation group (Table 10). The 2 cases met the Brighton Collaboration Level 1 case definition 
of acute intussusception. Both cases occurred over 30 days Post dose 2 at ~5 months of age, the time 
of peak incidence for naturally-occurring intussusception in the absence of rotavirus vaccination. The 
first case involved a 5.1 month old male, who developed intussusception on Day 37 Post dose 2 of 
study vaccine. The second case involved a 4.9 month old female, who developed intussusception on 
Day 45 Post dose 2 of study vaccine. Neither event was considered vaccine-related by the investigator 
and both subjects recovered. Because of the AE of intussusception, neither subject received a further 
dose of study vaccine, per prescribing information for the product.

Stool Testing For Rotavirus 
Stool samples were collected from subjects who experienced moderate-to-severe diarrhoea and/or 
vomiting (defined as 3 or more looser-than-normal stools in 24 hours, 1 watery stool in 24 hours, 
and/or forceful vomiting) within 14 days of study vaccination for rotavirus testing. Stool samples that 
were positive for rotavirus using an enzyme immunoassay (EIA) rotavirus antigen test, were further 
tested using real-time rotavirus polymer chain reaction assay (RT-PCR), assays specific for rotavirus 
VP6 genotype, VP4 genotype, and VP7 genotype. Of the 1014 subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
study vaccine, 115 (54 in the VVMC formulation and 61 in the current formulation group) had an AE of 
moderate-to severe diarrhoea and/or vomiting within 14 days of vaccination. Stool was tested for 51 
subjects with moderate or severe diarrhoea and/or vomiting within 14 days of vaccination. Of the 51 
subjects who had stool samples tested, 47 (92.2%) were negative for rotavirus by EIA. All 4 subjects 
(2 subjects Post dose 1 and 1 subject Post dose 2 in the VVMC formulation group; and 1 subject Post 
dose 1 in the current formulation group) with rotavirus EIA-positive stool specimens were determined 
to have vaccine strain rotavirus by RT-PCR. This was not an unexpected occurrence since faecal 
shedding of vaccine virus is known to occur post vaccination 
Discussion on clinical aspects 
The data demonstrated that the VVMC formulation of RotaTeq was non-inferior to the current 
formulation of RotaTeq with respect to immunogenicity. The primary immunogenicity hypothesis of 
non-inferiority was met for all 5 serotypes. The IgA GMT and the proportion of subjects with ≥ 3-fold 
rise in antibody titre (SNA and IgA) at 42 days post dose 3 were also similar in the new formulation 
and the current formulation groups. However, the GMT for G3 was 3.2 fold higher in the new 
formulation group compared to the current formulation group. It is the applicant’s opinion that the 
increased immunogenicity of the G3 reassortant may be due to improved stability in the VVMC 
formulation at multiple temperatures as well as less potency loss over time compared to the current 
formulation. 
Over 95% of subjects (97.3% in the new formulation and 95.2% in the current formulation group) had 
a ≥ 3-fold rise in serum anti-rotavirus IgA after completing the 3 dose regimen, and the 95% CIs 
overlapped. 
Although the VVMC formulation of RotaTeq™ appeared to be well-tolerated and had a generally similar 
safety profile as the current formulation of RotaTeq™, the incidence of adverse events like injection 
site erythema, dermatitis and urticaria appeared to be slightly higher in the VVMC formulation. 
The incidence of serious adverse events, albeit low, appeared to be somewhat higher in the VVMC 
formulation (3.9% vs 2.4%), nevertheless there were no vaccine-related serious adverse experiences 
and no deaths. 
It is notable that in a comparatively small population of patients, 2 cases of acute intussusception were 
reported in the VVMC formulation group.  Both cases occurred more than 30 days (Day 37 and Day 45) 
post-dose 2 at around 5 months of age. However, it should be noted that this period is the time of 
peak incidence for naturally-occurring intussusception in the absence of rotavirus vaccination, as 
reported in the literature. Nevertheless, neither event was considered vaccine-related by the 
investigator and both subjects recovered. In particular, the timing of the 2 cases of intussusception 
relative to time post-vaccination and the age of the subjects does not appear to suggest a causal link 
of the cases to vaccination.

2.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
This study appeared to demonstrate that the VVMC formulation of RotaTeq which is thermostable with 
a shelf life of three years, was non-inferior to the current formulation of RotaTeq with respect to 
immunogenicity. The VVMC formulation of RotaTeq appeared to be well-tolerated and had a generally 
similar safety profile as the current formulation of RotaTeq. Accordingly, there is no change to the 
benefit/risk assessment between the two formulations.  
Overall conclusion 
The submission is satisfactory in terms of addressing the requirements of the MAH under Article 46 of 
Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.

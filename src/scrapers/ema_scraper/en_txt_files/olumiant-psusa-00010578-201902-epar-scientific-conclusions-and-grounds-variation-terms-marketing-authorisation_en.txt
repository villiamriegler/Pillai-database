Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for baricitinib, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
An imbalance in reports of VTE with 0% (EAIR of 0,0) for placebo vs. 0,53% (EAIR of 1,3) for baricitinib 
4-mg was noted in placebo-controlled trials. VTE reporting rate is increasing. In July 2019 VTE reporting 
rate was 0,13% compared to 0,09% in February 2019. As of 01 July 2019, 114 VTEs have been reported 
in 102 cases from post-marketing reports. Moreover, recurrent DVT and subsequent PE observed 
September 2018 in patient who continued treatment with baricitinib after the first DVT also confirm 
possible relationship between use of baricitinib and occurrence of VTE. Therefore, the PRAC requests the 
MAH to update section 4.4 of the SmPC to modify the wording on “Venous Thromboembolism” to indicate 
that if clinical features of DVT/PE occur, baricitinib treatment should be discontinued and to update 
section 4.8 of the SmPC to add the adverse reaction pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis with 
a frequency not known.  
Data from clinical studies shows that the incidence rate of urticaria and face oedema is higher in the 
baricitinib 4 mg arm [urticarial: 0.60; face oedema: 0.89] compared to placebo arm [urticarial: 0.29; 
face oedema:0.29]. From the 316 events included for review from post-marketing reports, rash (n=95) 
was the most frequently reported event. Swelling face (n=23) and urticaria (n=20) were also frequently 
reported. From the 316 events retrieved as of 13 May 2019, 78 were categorised as systemic/oedema 
and 38 were categorised as non-specific. Taking into account information provided by MAH, at least part 
of non-specific events were indeed systemic however due the limited information it is not possible to 
categorise them properly. Moreover positive dechallenge (e.g. one case categorised as systemic) and 
positive dechallenge and rechallenge (e.g. one case categorised as non-specific) also support the view 
that baricitinib may cause systemic events. Therefore, the PRAC requests the MAH to update of section 
4.4 of the SmPC to add a warning on hypersensitivity and to update of Section 4.8 to add the adverse 
reactions “rash” with a frequency common and “swelling of the face, urticaria” with a frequency 
uncommon.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for baricitinib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing baricitinib is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

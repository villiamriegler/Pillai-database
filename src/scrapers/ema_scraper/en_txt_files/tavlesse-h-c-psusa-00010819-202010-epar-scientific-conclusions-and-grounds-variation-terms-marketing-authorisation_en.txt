Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for fostamatinib, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Based on the PSUR data submitted and the relatively high number (59x) of cases reporting headache, 
including 16 cases with a clear temporal  relationship, and a case with a positive rechallenge, the PRAC 
concluded that product information should be amended by including ‘headache’ as an ADR with 
frequency “common”. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for fostamatinib the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing fostamatinib is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Lonquex (XM22, lipegfilgrastim) is approved in adults for reduction in the duration of neutropenia and 
the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with 
the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes). The treatment is given in 
a  context  of  chemotherapy  therapy  usually  in  four  to  six  2-3-week  treatment  cycles,  and  the  G-CSF 
treatment can continue sometimes over several years’ time span. The frequency of the G-CSF treatment 
is  dependent  on  the  length  of  the  chemotherapy  treatment  and  the  number  of  neutropenia episodes. 
The MAH has applied for an extension of indication to paediatric patients with 6 months of age or older.  
State the claimed therapeutic indication 
The MAH proposed first the following indication in the MAA: (bold=new) 
“Lonquex is indicated in adult and paediatric patients with 6 months of age or older for reduction 
in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients treated with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy  for  malignancy  (with  the  exception  of  chronic  myeloid  leukaemia  and  myelodysplastic 
syndromes).” 
During the process this was modified and agreed by Rapporteur and MAH as follows: 
“Lonquex is indicated in adults and in children 2 years of age and older for reduction in the duration 
of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy 
for malignancy (with the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes).” 
Epidemiology 
Lonquex is indicated in several malignant conditions with heterogeneous origin to support the reduction 
in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia as a supplementation to prevent 
chemotherapy  (CTX)-induced  neutropenia.  The  incidence  and  mortality  are  specific  to  the  underlying 
condition. In a prospective study on the epidemiology of febrile episodes during chemotherapy-induced 
neutropenia  in  children,  neutropenic  periods  with  primary  febrile  episodes  were  observed  in  48%  of 
patients  undergoing  aggressive  treatment  for  acute  leukaemia  or  NHL  and  in  9%  of  patients  during 
maintenance chemotherapy for acute leukaemia (Castagnola et al., 2007). 
Biologic features 
Lonquex (lipegfilgrastim) promotes the proliferation and differentiation of progenitor cells within the bone 
marrow  and  the  release  of  mature  neutrophils  into  the  peripheral  blood  in  patients  treated  with  the 
myelosuppressive  CTX.  There  are  also  differences  by  developmental  stage  and  age  in  neutrophil 
proportions  of  WBC  (e.g.  between  proportions  of  lymphocytes  and  neutrophils)  and  the  neutrophil 
predominance increase from early childhood to the teenage years and adulthood.

Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/642324/2022 
Page 10/146 
  
 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The  product  is  claimed  in  variable  malignant  conditions  and  tumour  stages  with  different  prognosis 
together with the myelosuppressive chemotherapy to return the treatment reduced neutrophil levels. 
Management 
Lonquex  (lipegfilgrastim)  allows  the  longer  acting  effect  and  less  frequent  dosing  in  the  neutropenia 
reduction as a supplementation of various cancer CTX treatments. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Lonquex  is  produced  by  site  specific  enzyme  mediated  covalent  attachment  of  a  single  20  kDA 
polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecule enzymatically through a glycolinker to the amino acid Thr134 (which 
corresponds  to  the  glycosylation  site  Thr133  in  endogenous  G-CSF)  of  recombinant  r-met-Hu-G-CSF. 
The glycolinker consists of (PEG-) Glycin – Sialic Acid – GalNAc (-Thr). By means of this glycoPEGylation 
the  PD  effect  is  prolonged  compared  to  non-(glyco-)  PEGylated  filgrastim.  XM22  (lipegfilgrastim)  is  a 
structurally distinct molecule that is clearly differentiated from pegfilgrastim.  
The  G-CSF  moiety  of  lipegfilgrastim  stimulates  the  proliferation  of  haematopoietic  progenitor  cells, 
differentiation into mature cells and release into the peripheral blood. This effect includes not only the 
neutrophil  lineage  but  extends  to  other  single  lineage  and  multilineage  progenitors  and  pluripotent 
haematopoietic stem cells. G-CSF also increases the antibacterial activities of neutrophils including the 
phagocytosis. 
The product has been approved for the reduction of the duration and the incidence of febrile neutropenia 
in the chemotherapy-induced neutropenia in adults in 2013 in the EU. 
The dosing recommended for Lonquex in adults is 6 mg (a single pre-filled syringe of Lonquex) for each 
chemotherapy cycle and should be given approximately 24 hours after cytotoxic chemotherapy via the 
subcutaneous route. Lonquex 6 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe is suitable also for children 
weighing  45  kg  and  more.  To  facilitate  the  use  of  lipegfilgrastim  in  paediatric  patients,  glass  vials 
containing a 10 mg/mL lipegfilgrastim solution for subcutaneous (SC) injection were developed. 
In the current procedure the MAH first proposed the following posology for the children and adolescents. 
The recommended posology (vial formulation) by weight categories for the paediatric patients ≥6 months 
of age and weighing less than 45 kg first proposed in children was the following: 
Table 1 
Body weight (kg)

Dose (for each chemotherapy cycle, given approximately

1.2 mg (0.12 ml) 
2.5 mg (0.25 ml) 
4.5 mg (0.45 ml) 
6 mg (0.6 ml) 
During  the  procedure  the  children  below  2  years  of  age  were  withdrawn  from  the  indication  and  the 
posology (vial formulation) for the paediatric patients ≥2 years of age and weighing less than 45 kg was 
proposed as follows:

2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The current development program has not received the CHMP Scientific Advice. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
According to the MAH, all clinical studies were conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki and 
local  legal  and  ethical  requirements.  They  conformed  to  the  principles  of  good  clinical  practice  as 
applicable in the regions where the studies were performed. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
XM22  is  a  conjugate  of  recombinant  N-methionyl  human  granulocyte-colony  stimulating  factor 
(r-met-Hu-G-CSF, Filgrastim, company code: XM21) and a single polyethylene glycol (PEG) molecule. 
To  generate  XM22,  a  PEG  molecule  is  covalently  attached,  via  a  carbohydrate  linker,  to  XM21  at 
Threonine134.  This  site-specific  glycoPEGylation  is  achieved  through  sequential  action  of  two 
recombinant  glycosyltransferase  enzymes,  with  activated  sugar  nucleotide  donor  substrates  (UDP-
GalNAc and CMP-SA-PEG coupled to 20kDa-methoxy-PEG via sialic acid).  
The subject of this Application is addition of XM22 Drug Product presentation in vials. The XM22 Drug 
Product formulation in vials was specifically developed for use in paediatric patients.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The XM22 Drug Substance that is used to fill XM22 drug product (DP) in vials is the same as the one 
used in currently approved finished XM22 Drug Product presented in a pre-filled syringe (6 mg/0.6 mL).  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development   
XM22 drug product (DP) is a sterile, preservative-free aqueous solution for subcutaneous administration, 
presented in vials. Each vial contains 6 mg of XM22 (based on protein content) in 0.6 mL and following 
excipients:  acetic  acid,  sodium  hydroxide,  polysorbate20,  sorbitol,  and  water  for  injection.  The 
composition is the same as for the approved PFS presentation. No excipients of animal of human origin 
and no novel excipients are used in the manufacture of XM22 drug product.

The vial  presentation  (6 mg/0.6  mL)  was  developed  to  support  a  paediatric  application.  An  overfill  of 
0.15 mL is included in each vial to ensure the 0.6 mL volume can be withdrawn from vials containing the 
XM22 drug product.  
The physicochemical and biological properties for XM22 DP in vials are the same as that of XM22 DP in 
PFS.  Both  presentations,  vials  and  PFS,  were  used  in  clinical  studies  during  product  development.  A 
comparability assessment between vial DP batches and PFS DP batches demonstrated equal quality.  
The  control  strategy  for  the  XM22  DP  vial  manufacturing  process  was  established  based  on  previous 
experience with PFS manufacturing, as well as the vial manufacturing processes performed throughout 
development.  
In conclusion, sufficient information on pharmaceutical development of XM22 DP vial has been provided. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  for  XM22  drug  product  in  vials  employs  standard  pharmaceutical 
manufacturing  methods  for  the  production  of  injectable  products  that  cannot  be  terminally  sterilized. 
The  manufacturing,  labelling,  packaging,  testing  and  batch  release  facilities  for  XM22  DP  in  vials  are 
identical to those for the pre-filled syringe. A list of manufacturing and QC sites arranged by function is 
presented in the form of a Supply Chain Flowchart. Adequate GMP certifications are provided for each 
site.   
A  flow  diagram  of  the  XM22  DP  vial  manufacturing  process  has  been  adequately  provided.  The 
manufacturing process is essentially the same as that of XM22 in PFS, consisting of preparation of the 
bulk solution, sterile filtration and aseptic filling into primary packaging. The compounding and sterile 
filtration steps for vials are similar to that of XM22 DP in PFS; however, the filling process is specific for 
vials. 
Description and control on the process steps, as well as CPPs and CIPCs, have been provided only in the 
previously  approved  MAA  for  XM22  DP  PFS,  except  for  filling,  visual  inspection,  labelling,  secondary 
packaging and storage, which are specific for the vial presentation and are adequately provided in the 
current  application.  Critical  steps  and  in-process  controls  of  the  XM22  DP  vial  manufacturing  process 
include  compounding,  sterile  filtration,  aseptic  filling,  and  the  control  of  filling  volume  to  ensure 
compliance  with  safety  requirements  and the  minimal  extractable  volume of  0.6  mL  as  stated on the 
label.  
The  DP  manufacturing  process  has  been  appropriately  validated  with  three  consecutive  PPQ  batches 
manufactured at the commercial scale and site. The validation included bulk compounding, bulk sterile 
filtration and aseptic filling steps, as well as time limitation for each stage. All of the results were within 
specifications. Media fill validation is adequately performed. 
Container closure system 
The XM22 drug product (DP) is packaged in single-use containers. The components of the commercial 
container closure system include type I clear borosilicate glass vial, FluoroTec bromobutyl stopper and 
aluminium crimp seal with plastic flip-off cap. Technical diagrams of the container closure components 
have been adequately provided. Vials and stoppers are purchased as non-sterile and are subsequently 
sterilized using validated operational conditions. 
Based on the TSE/BSE statements provided from the vendors/suppliers, the vials and stoppers do not 
contain any materials derived from animal origin and therefore, have no potential TSE/BSE risk.

The suitability of the container closure system to provide protection from microbial contamination was 
shown  in  the  microbial  challenge  test.  Compatibility  with  the  drug  product  solution  was  assessed  via 
stability studies and a screening study with respect to leachables was performed. The results confirmed 
suitability of the chosen container closure system.  
Overall, it has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished 
product XM22 in vial of intended quality in a reproducible manner. 
Product specification 
The proposed release and shelf-life specifications for the drug product in vial are adequately presented 
in the dossier. 
The parameters included in the drug product specification are found adequate to control the quality of 
the XM22 drug product in vial at release and shelf-life. The presented specifications are mostly the same 
as  approved  for  XM22  DP  in  PFS.  The  analytical  procedures  which  are  also  used  for  DS  are  already 
approved  in  previous  submissions.  Brief  descriptions  of  analytical  procedures  specifically  used  to  test 
XM22 DP in vial (appearance of immediate packaging and sterility) are provided in this submission. 
There  are  no  product-  and  process-related  impurities  present  in  XM22 DP  in  vial,  further  than  those 
approved for DS. The methods applied for control of drug product are designed and capable of monitoring 
the respective impurities. The data presented for the PFS product is used to justify vial DP compliance 
to ICH Q3D requirements on the elemental impurities. 
The batch data presented support the proposed acceptance criteria. All testing is performed using XM22 
drug substance standards, which are described and approved in previous submissions. 
Stability of the product 
The  applicant  proposed  a  shelf-life  of  36  months  at  5°C  ±  3°C  for  the  finished  product  in  vials.  The 
stability studies are conducted at 5°C ± 3°C (long-term storage condition) and 25°C ± 2°C/60 ± 5% 
relative humidity (accelerated storage condition), according to the relevant ICH stability guidelines to 
evaluate the chemical, physical, microbiological and biological stability of XM22 DP in vials. The stability 
studies  are  ongoing.  Acceptable  stability  protocol  and  testing  frequency  is  presented.  36  months  of 
stability  data  under  long-term/real-time  conditions  is  available  for  XM-22  DP  vial  PPQ  batches, 
representative of the intended commercial process. The results obtained so far for the vial PPQ batches 
stored under long-term/real-time conditions remained within specification over the stability study period 
completed. The container closure system has maintained its integrity and the product has not displayed 
any microbial growth.  
Therefore,  based  on  the  available  stability  data,  the  shelf-life  of  Lonquex  drug  product  in  vial  of  36 
months and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC (Store in a refrigerator (2°C – 8°C). Do not freeze. 
Keep the vials in the outer carton in order to protect from light.) are acceptable.     
In addition, in accordance with the available data, the MAH proposed to change the time period of storage 
below  25°C  after  Lonquex  is  removed  from  the  refrigerator  from  3  (currently  applicable  for  the  PFS 
presentation) to 7 days for the vial presentation. The proposed change is considered acceptable, based 
on the supportive data on the PFS and on the accelerated stability study at 25°C for the vials, where all 
results remained within specification up to 1 month of storage.  
One batch of XM22 DP in vials will be placed on stability each year of manufacturing. The stability studies 
will be conducted annually. Any deviations or unexpected trends in post approval stability studies will be 
reported to the Health Authority in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements.

Adventitious agents 
The drug substance and the formulation of XM22 DP in vials remains identical to that of the approved 
XM22 DP in pre-filled syringes (PFS). Thus, the data approved for the PFS presentation are equally valid 
for the vials and are not repeated in this submission.  
2.2.4.  Discussion and conclusions on chemical, pharmaceutical and 
biological aspects 
The MAH has submitted an extension application to register a new vial presentation for Lonquex (XM22) 
drug  product,  i.e.  6  mg/0.6  ml  solution  for  injection  in  vial.  The  formulation  and  strength of  the  new 
presentation are identical to that of the currently authorised Lonquex PFS presentation. The XM22 Drug 
Product formulation in vials was specifically developed for use in paediatric patients. 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the finished product has been presented in a 
satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried out  indicate  consistency  and  uniformity  of  important 
product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a 
satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
No  major  objections  were  identified  during  the  assessment.  The  quality  concerns  raised  during  the 
procedure were adequately answered and all issues are considered solved. In summary, from a quality 
point of view, a positive CHMP opinion of the quality part can be recommended. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
The  variation  Application  concerned  the  extension  of  the  therapeutic  indication  to  paediatric  patients 
from 6 months of age onwards. The treatment is given in a context of CTX therapy usually in four to six 
2-3-week treatment cycles, and the G-CSF treatment can continue sometimes over several years’ time 
span”. Therefore, although no new non-clinical data were initially submitted by the MAH, the MAH was 
requested to discuss the potential concerns for use of PEGylated medicinal product in paediatric patients.  
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Currently, there is still limited data on the potential risks for PEG accumulation in paediatric patients. 
PEG has shown to lead to accumulation and vacuolation within specific cells of the CNS (choroid plexus 
epithelia), liver and kidney in nonclinical species (EMA/CHMP/SWP/647258/2012: CHMP Safety Working 
Party’s response to the PDCO regarding the use of PEGylated drug products in the paediatric population).  
The long-term safety of Lonquex was evaluated following weekly SC administrations of up to 6 months 
(26 weeks)  in  rats  and  up  to  3  months  in  monkeys.  No  pre-  and  post-natal  development  or  juvenile 
animal studies have been conducted. The clinical data from children is limited, i.e. in total 42 paediatric 
patients have been exposed (including 14 patients of 2-6 years old and 7 patients of 2-3 years old). No 
data exists from 6 months to 2 years old patients, which is the most vulnerable paediatric patient group 
(see further information on the Clinical section).  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Lipegfilgrastim is a covalent conjugate of filgrastim (unglycosylated recombinant methionyl human G- 
CSF) with a single methoxy PEG molecule (presented as a linear 20 kDa PEG) via a carbohydrate linker 
Lonquex EMEA/H/C/002556/II/0058/G 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/642324/2022 
Page 15/146 
  
 
consisting of glycine, N-acetylneuraminic acid and N-acetylgalactosamine. The average molecular mass 
is ~39 kDa (18,798 Da filgrastim, 203 Da GalNAc, 338 Da glycylsialic acid, 20 kDa PEG).  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics of Lonquex has been evaluated following single SC injection to Sprague Dawley rats 
and the Cynomolgus monkeys. Toxicokinetic evaluations of Lonquex were performed following single and 
repeated dosing in rats and monkeys in general toxicity studies and in pregnant rabbits in an embryo-
foetal toxicity study.  
In  pharmacokinetics  studies  Lonquex  was  compared  to  filgrastim  and  pegfilgrastim  (Neulasta)  to 
investigate  the  prolongation  effect  of  glyco-pegylation  of 
lipegfilgrastim  (Lonquex)  on  the 
pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic profile. Results of an in vitro metabolism study indicated that 
Lonquex,  filgrastim  and  Neulasta  are  digested  by  purified  neutrophil  elastase  as  well  as  human 
neutrophils. However, lipegfilgrastim appeared to be more resistant to degradation by human neutrophil 
elastase  than  filgrastim  and  pegfilgrastim.  Results  in  nephrectomised  male  rats  showed  that  the 
estimated percentage contribution of renal clearance to total body clearance was 0.954% for Lonquex, 
38.0% for Neulasta, and 81.7% for Neupogen. These findings are summarised in the Lonquex EPAR as 
follows ‘PK profile of Lonquex bears close similarity to that of Neulasta (pegfilgrastim). Nevertheless, it 
was shown that there are differences: in rats the contribution of renal clearance of Lonquex to total body 
clearance was much smaller than for Neulasta, and degradation of Lonquex by human neutrophil elastase 
was much slower than for Neulasta’. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxicity was investigated in the rat only as part of the relevant safety pharmacology study. 
A  single  SC  injection  of  Lonquex  10  mg/kg  bodyweight  (or  vehicle)  to  6  male  and  6  female  Sprague 
Dawley rats was not associated with any sign of toxicity. All animals gained the expected body weight, 
and there were no macroscopic findings at necropsy. 
Repeat dose toxicity  
Repeated dose toxicity was evaluated in rats and monkeys; maximal tested doses given SC once a week 
dose of Lonquex was 1.5  mg/kg for 4 weeks or up  to 1 mg/kg for 26 weeks in rats and 13 weeks in 
monkeys. Doses refer to the protein content only i.e. the PEG moiety and the carbohydrate linker was 
not included. These studies were completed in the year 2010 (rat) and 2009 (monkey).  
In these studies, rats were administered with XM22 up to 1000µg/kg 1Qw for 26 weeks (approximately 
0,16 µmol/kg/month) with an 8-week recovery. Primary effects were pharmacology related. Cynomolgus 
monkeys  were  administered  with  XM22  up  to  1000µg/kg  for  13  weeks  (approximately  0,08 
µmol/kg/month)  with  a  6-week  recovery.  Increased  neutrophil  counts  were  noted  in  kidney  (among 
other organs). No other events were noted for kidney or brain. 
There was no morbidity or mortality up to the maximal tested doses. Following key safety findings were 
reported:

Reproduction toxicity 
No pre- and postnatal development toxicity studies were conducted with Lonquex. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Justification  of  absence  of  specific  environmental  risk  assessment  (ERA)  studies  in  line  with  the  EMA 
guideline (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2.) was included for this extension of indication application. 
Lonquex is a PEGylated recombinant protein that is linked via a short carbohydrate chain and undergoes 
hydrolysis  and  proteolytic  cleavage  following  administration.  The  linker  components  (L-Glycine,  sialic 
acid  and  GalNac)  are  also  naturally  occurring  substances.  The  PEG  moiety  is  unlikely  to  result  in  a 
significant risk to the environment, because of metabolic breakdown before excretion in patients, rapid 
biodegradation in the environment and low toxicity.  
The extension of use of Lonquex to include paediatric patients is not expected to increase the overall 
consumption  nor  to  increase  the  environmental  exposure  to  this  class  of  drugs.  Therefore,  separate 
ERA studies for Lonquex are not required.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
During  the  evaluation  of  this  variation  application,  the  MAH  was  requested  to  discuss  the  potential 
concerns for use of Lonquex, which is a PEGylated medicinal product in paediatric patients.  
There  is  still  limited  data  on  the  potential  long-term  risks  for  PEG  accumulation  in  various  organs  in 
paediatric patients. Consequently, a multidisciplinary safety (nonclinical and clinical) OC was raised that 
requested the MAH to provide further clarification of the safe use and the potential risks of Lonquex, in 
the intended paediatric patients. In their response, MAH provided comprehensive summary of a literature 
and EPAR data search for PEGylated medicinal products and performed a thorough risk assessment of 
the PEG accumulation in children treated with lipegfilgrastim.  
PEG has shown to lead to accumulation and vacuolation within specific cells of the CNS (choroid plexus 
epithelia),  the  liver  and  kidney  in  nonclinical  species  (EMA/CHMP/SWP/647258/2012:  CHMP  Safety 
Working Party’s response to the PDCO regarding the use of PEGylated drug products in the paediatric 
population). Thus far, these findings in animals have not been reported to associate with the functional 
consequences. Experience from toxicology studies of PEGylated biopharmaceuticals have indicated that 
PEG-related  vacuolation  has  not  been  associated  with  demonstrable  cell  or  tissue  dysfunction. 
Furthermore,  according to  Zhu  et  al  (2020) pharmacovigilance data  between the 1st  quarter  of  2004 
Lonquex EMEA/H/C/002556/II/0058/G 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/642324/2022 
Page 17/146 
  
 
and  the  4th  quarter  of  2018  of  AEs  associated  with  PEGylation  (in  comparison  to  parent  drugs),  the 
pharmacovigilance profiles of PEGylated and non-PEGylated agents were similar.  
The long-term safety of weekly SC administrations of Lonquex was evaluated in adult rats up to 6 months 
and in monkeys up to 3 months. MAH further clarified that there was no evidence of vacuolation in these 
studies, evaluated with the histopathology method with adequate sensitivity to detect vacuoles.  It was 
also demonstrated that the lowest amount of PEG-related radioactivity was seen in the brain relative to 
the other tissues, and concluded that it is unlikely, that Lonquex would undergo active transport across 
the  blood-CSF  barrier.    No  pre-  and  post-natal  development  or  juvenile  animal  studies  have  been 
conducted with Lonquex.  
Lonquex appears more resistant for degradation by human neutrophil elastases than Neulasta, with the 
reduced  renal  clearance  in  comparison  to  Neulasta  (Lonquex  EPAR).  The  MAH  was  asked  to  clarify  if 
these pharmacokinetic differences have any consequences for accumulation potential of PEG-moiety of 
Lonquex. The MAH adequately clarified that the sensitivity to elastase degradation may explain the longer 
t1/2 and mean residence times seen for lipegfilgrastim compared to Neulasta, but since the neutrophil 
receptor binding and primary pathway of degradation and elimination of the PEG-moiety are comparable, 
the overall potential for PEG accumulation of Neulasta and Lonquex is expected to be comparable. 
The clinical data with Lonquex from children is limited, that is, in total 42 paediatric patients have been 
exposed (including 14 patients of 2-6-year-old and 7 patients of 2-3 year old) (please consult Clinical 
aspects).  This  clinical  data  did  not  overall  indicate  significant  differences  in  the  safety  profile  of 
lipegfilgrastim in children compared to that in adults. However, no clinical data exists from the youngest 
paediatric patient population of 6 months to 2 years old, which is the most vulnerable paediatric patient 
group. The extrapolation of lipegfilgrastim safety in adults and older children to children less than 2 years 
of age was further pursued under clinical issues (2nd request for supplementary information).  
1  mg  of  lipegfilgrastim  by  protein  content  contains  approximately  1.06  mg  PEG  which  equates  to 
0.053 μmol  PEG.  MAH  provided  calculations  for  the monthly  PEG  exposure  (μmol/kg/month)  for  each 
body weight category assuming 15 cycles per year of chemotherapy as a median number of cycles for 
Ewing tumors: 
• 
6  to  10  kg:  0.6  mg  lipegfilgrastim  by  protein  content  per  cycle  =  0.032  μmol  PEG  per  cycle, 
= 0.48 μmol PEG per year (15 cycles), = 0.040 μmol PEG per month. Taking a minimum weight of 6 kg, 
this gives a PEG exposure of 0.0066 μmol/kg/month. 
• 
>10 to 20 kg: 1.5 mg lipegfilgrastim by protein content per cycle = 0.080 μmol PEG per cycle, 
= 1.20 μmol PEG per year (15 cycles), = 0.100 μmol PEG per month. Taking a minimum weight of 10 
kg, this gives a PEG exposure of 0.010 μmol/kg/month. 
• 
>20 to 30 kg: 2.5 mg lipegfilgrastim by protein content per cycle = 0.133 μmol PEG per cycle, 
= 1.99 μmol PEG per year (15 cycles), = 0.166 μmol PEG per month. Taking a minimum weight of 20 
kg, this gives a PEG exposure of 0.0083 μmol/kg/month. 
• 
>30 to 45 kg: 4 mg lipegfilgrastim by protein content per cycle = 0.212 μmol PEG per cycle, 
= 3.18 μmol PEG per year (15 cycles), = 0.265 μmol PEG per month. Taking a minimum weight of 30 
kg, this gives a PEG exposure of 0.0088 μmol/kg/month. 
• 
>45 kg: 6 mg lipegfilgrastim by protein content per cycle = 0.318 μmol PEG per cycle, =4.77 
μmol PEG per year (15 cycles), = 0.398 μmol PEG per month. Taking a minimum weight of 45 kg, this 
gives a PEG exposure of 0.0088 μmol/kg/month. 
Therefore, lipegfilgrastim administered in conjunction with cytotoxic chemotherapy is of limited duration 
up to 1 year and no body weight category will exceed a PEG exposure of 0.010 μmol/kg/month. The 
MAH referred to the ≥0.4 µmol/kg/month threshold of concern stated in the SWP response to the PDCO 
Lonquex EMEA/H/C/002556/II/0058/G

products 
in

paediatric 
population 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/6475258/2012), but since then, PEG-related vacuolations have been observed in other 
species,  with  smaller  PEG  moieties  (<  40  kDa),  and  with  a  lower  monthly  PEG  exposure  than 
0.4 µmol/kg/month.  Nevertheless,  there  were  no  vacuolations  observed  in  the  repeated  dose  studies 
with  Lonquex,  and  it  is  unlikely  that  Lonquex  would  undergo  active  transport  across  the  blood-CSF 
barrier.  
In their response to 2nd request for supplementary information, the MAH proposed to limit the indication 
of  lipegfilgrastim  to  children  2  years  of  age  and  older.  No  change  to  section  5.3  of  the  SmPC  were 
warranted.  This was agreed.  
Assessment of paediatric data on non-clinical aspects 
No  pre-  and  postnatal  development  studies  or  juvenile  toxicity  studies  have  been  conducted  with 
Lonquex.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In order to address the issue of the potential long-term risks for PEG accumulation in various organs in 
paediatric patients and considering the limited clinical data in this age group (please see clinical section), 
the MAH proposed to limit the indication of lipegfilgrastim to children 2 years of age and older. 
It can be concluded that the risk related to the PEG in use of Lonquex, is low/negligible for treatment of 
paediatric patients 2-years of age and older. Based on the data submitted in this application, the use of 
Lipegfilgrastim in the proposed new/extended paediatric indication is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic data were available from two studies, XM22-07 and XM22-08. Of these, the XM22-07 
contained  PK  parameters  as  the  primary  endpoints,  and  study  XM22-07  and  its  addendum  (which 
contained  follow  up  data  including  the  results  of  immunogenicity  testing,  survival  status  and  G-CSF 
therapy) 
has

assessed 
in 
procedures 
EMA/H/C/002556/P46/008 
and 
EMA/H/C/002556/P46/009, respectively. Further, study XM22-08 and its addendum did not report PK, 
instead the study XM22-08 report stated that the PK results will be outlined in a separate population 
PK/PD modelling report. This report is included in the current submission and is summarized in section 
PK/PD modelling.  
Study XM22-07:

The primary objective was to assess the pharmacokinetics of a single subcutaneous injection of XM22, 
100µg/kg body weight, in children with Ewing family of tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma. 
Secondary  objectives  were  to  assess  the  pharmacodynamics,  efficacy,  safety,  tolerability  and 
immunogenicity of this single dose in the same patient population.  
This phase 1 study included a screening period and a 3-week treatment and assessment period. The end 
of study visit, to mark the end of the treatment period, was conducted at 21 days post dose.  In the 
follow-up period, immunogenicity samples were obtained at approximately day 180 and day 360 post 
administration of XM22.  
A  total  of  21  patients  were  planned  for  enrolment,  stratified  into  3  equal-  sized  groups  by  age 
(2 to <6 years, 6 to <12 years and 12 to <18 years). Recruitment of patients in the youngest age group 
was to begin only after the results of the PD and safety data for the two higher-age strata had been 
reviewed by the Data Monitoring Committee, composed of 3 independent paediatric oncology experts.  
A single dose of 100µg/kg XM22 (batch numbers 1016122 and 1005510) up to a maximum of 6mg was 
administered subcutaneously 24 hours (±3 hours) after the end of the last chemotherapy treatment in 
week 1 of the regimen. XM22 administration was to occur generally on day 4 with VIDE chemotherapy, 
day 3  with  VDA  or  IVA  and  day  2,  3,  4  or  6  with  VAC  (dependent  on  the  actinomycin  and 
cyclophosphamide  regimens).  Commercially  available  G-CSFs  were  not to  be administered  during  the 
study treatment period but could be administered for subsequent chemotherapy cycles during the follow-
up period at the discretion of the investigator.  
Samples for PK assessments were obtained pre-dose and periodically for up to 240 hours (144 hours in 
the lowest age group) after XM22 administration. PK parameters were AUC0-tlast, AUC0-inf, Cmax, Tmax, λz 
(rate  constant  associated  with  the  terminal  phase),  t1/2,  MRT  (mean  residual  time),  CL/F  (apparent 
clearance),  %AUC  (%  of  extrapolated  area  in  relation  to  the  total  AUC),  Vz/F  (apparent  volume  of 
distribution during the terminal phase). 
On average, XM22 was rapidly absorbed following subcutaneous administration in each age group, with 
peak  exposure  levels  being  maintained  over  a  prolonged  period  of  time  (days)  due  to  nonlinear  PK 
behaviour. Maximum serum XM22 concentration was reached at 50.3 hours (292 ± 178 ng/mL) in the 
2 to <6  years  group,  45.4  hours  (303  ±  144  ng/mL)  in  the  6  to  <12  years  group  and  82.2  hours 
(341 ± 381 ng/mL) in the 12 to <18 years group (see Figure 1). The corresponding geometric means 
(coefficients of variation) of Cmax for the age groups were 243 ng/mL (61.0%), 256 ng/mL (47.5%) and 
225 ng/mL (111.6%) respectively. The higher coefficient of variation for the 12 to <18 years group is 
likely due to the unusually high XM22 concentration measured for patient 07050203 (see

As  PK  sampling  in  the  youngest  age  group  stopped  at  144  hours  after  XM22  administration,  full 
PK parameters could be derived for only 3 of the 7 younger patients. This made meaningful comparison 
across the age groups difficult for most of the PK parameters (Table 4). Analysis of variance revealed 
no  detectable  difference  in  PK  parameters  of  interest  [Cmax  (p=0.9560),  AUC0-t  (p=  0.4130), 
Vz/F (p=0.7125), CL/F (0.6038)} among age groups. The average Cmax values and Cmax variability were 
comparable across age groups.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Human G-CSF is a glycoprotein that regulates the production and release of functional neutrophils from 
the bone marrow. Filgrastim is an un-glycosylated recombinant methionyl human G-CSF. Lipegfilgrastim 
is  a  sustained  duration  form  of  filgrastim  due  to  decreased  renal  clearance.  Lipegfilgrastim  binds  to 
human  the  G-CSF  receptor  like  filgrastim  and  pegfilgrastim.  Lipegfilgrastim  and  filgrastim  induced  a 
marked  increase  in  peripheral  blood  neutrophil  counts  with  minor  increases  in  monocytes  and/or 
lymphocytes. These results suggest that the G-CSF moiety of lipegfilgrastim confers the expected activity 
of this growth factor: stimulation of proliferation of haematopoietic progenitor cells, differentiation into 
mature cells and release into the peripheral blood. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Study XM22-07 
The primary objective of the study XM22-07 was to assess the PK of lipegfilgrastim. Pharmacodynamic 
results  were  analysed  using  ANC  and  CD34+  measurements.  For  further  information,  see  AR  Section 
2.3.2 Pharmacokinetics for the study design and background information and for the results of the ANC 
(primary and secondary efficacy endpoint). 
The PD parameters analysed in the XM22-07 study: 
For ANC: 
•  ANC nadir (measured in days), which is the lowest ANC recorded time to ANC nadir, which is the 
time from the beginning of chemotherapy up to the occurrence of the ANC nadir 
• 
• 
time to ANC recovery to ≥1.0 x 109/L, and time to ANC recovery to ≥2.0 x 109/L from nadir 
time  to  ANC  recovery  to  ≥1.0  x  109/L,  and  time  to  ANC  recovery  to  ≥2.0  x  109/L  from  first 
chemotherapy 
For circulating CD34+ cells: 
•  CD34+ area over baseline effect curve 
•  CD34+ AUC, which is the area under the curve 
•  CD34+max, which is the maximum observed value of the CD34+ cells blood count 
•  CD34+tmax, which is the time to reach the CD34+ cell count maximum

The mean ANC nadir was higher for the youngest age group compared with the older age groups. The 
difference between the age groups might be explained by the fact that the 2 to <6 years group received 
predominantly IVA chemotherapy, which is known to have less of a myelosuppressive effect than either 
VAC or VIDE. The mean times to ANC nadir from the start of chemotherapy (from XM22 administration) 
was longer for the youngest age group compared with the older groups. The mean times to ANC recovery 
were shortest for the youngest age group. The geometric means of the ANC area under the curve were 
similar for the two younger age groups, and higher for the oldest group. The p-value of 0.7125 from an 
analysis of variance model indicated no effect of age group on the ANC area under the curve. The data 
on derived parameters from ANC by age group is shown in Table 5.

The overall time as well as the time to ANC nadir from the start of chemotherapy and XM22 was shortest 
in the subjects receiving VIDE chemotherapy. Correspondingly, the time to ANC recovery (≥1.0 x 109/L 
and ≥2.0 x 109/L) both from start of chemotherapy as well as from ANC nadir was longest in the subjects 
receiving  VIDE  chemotherapy.  Regarding  the  overall  ANC  AUC,  the  geometric  mean  and  median  was 
lowest in the group receiving VAC and highest in the subjects receiving IVA chemotherapy. The data on 
derived parameters from ANC by type of chemotherapy is shown in Table 6.

data shows the age-related increase in the CD34+ counts and AUC as well as an increased duration to 
reach  the  peak  of  CD34+  cell  count  from  the  start  of  CTX  and  XM22  (Table  7).  By  the  type  of 
chemotherapy, the mean maximum CD34+ count was highest for the VIDE group as well as AUC ( 
Table 8). Also, the duration to reach peak CD34+ cell count from the start of CTX or XM22 was longest 
for the VIDE group.

The  geometric  mean  AUCANC  until  day  15  in  the  lipegfilgrastim  group  was  higher  compared  to  the 
filgrastim group (104.9473 × 109/L*days vs 84.2795 × 109/L*days; per-protocol analysis set) (Table 
9). When the results were shown by the stratified age cohorts, and the CTX regimen administered in 
Cycle 1, there were no meaningful differences in the mean AUCANC values between the lipegfilgrastim 
and  filgrastim  treatment  groups  in  the  corresponding  age  cohorts  and  CTX  regimens.  The  geometric 
mean ratio (GMR) (95% CI for GMR) of AUCANC was 1.2859 (0.90873, 1.81973) for the model with age

No meaningful differences between the two treatment groups were observed in the following endpoints: 
mean AUCANC values in Cycle 1 (Table 9), mean ANC nadir values in cycles 1 to 4 (Table 10 and Table 
11), mean time to ANC nadir in cycles 1 to 4 from the start of CTX or IMP administration (Table 12), 
and mean times to ANC recovery threshold of ANC >1.0 × 109/L and ANC >2.0 × 109/L in cycles 1 to 4 
(Table  13  and  Table  14).  Results  in  the  ITT  analysis  set  were  consistent  with  the  results  in  the  PP

2.4.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Report PMX-21-01 
Objectives 
The goal of these analyses was to extend and improve the understanding of the PK of XM22 and the 
mechanistic  exposure-response  (E-R)  relationship  between  XM22  and  ANC  in  pediatric  patients  with 
cancer 2 to <18 years of age by leveraging information from data collected in adult patients with cancer.

Updating the PopPK and PK/PD models with pooled data from the combined pediatric and adult oncology 
patients allowed an enhanced assessment of the similarity or lack of similarity in the PK of XM22 and/or 
the E-R relationship for ANC in paediatrics compared to adults, including evaluation of the relative impact 
of ANC and influence of other key intrinsic factors including age and body weight. 
The following analysis objectives contributed to the accomplishment of the overall project goal: 
•  Re-estimation and refinement of the previously developed PopPK model using pooled data from 
pediatric  oncology  patients,  adult  oncology  patients,  and  healthy  adult  subjects  to  improve 
characterization of the concentration-time course of XM22. 
•  Systematic evaluation of structural components of the PopPK model and assessment of the effect 
of pertinent patient factors (including age and body weight) to development of a PopPK model 
predictive of XM22 PK in patients with cancer from 2 years of age to adulthood. 
•  Critical  evaluation  and  revision  of  the  semi-mechanistic  PK/PD  model  using  pooled  data  from 
pediatric  and  adult  oncology  patients  to  improve  characterization  of  the  concentration-time 
course of XM22 and its associated effects on the time-course of ANC. 
o  Systematic evaluation of individual components of the PK/PD model to address questions 
and requests set forth in the EMA’s assessment reports. 
•  Stochastic simulation based on the updated PK/PD model to predict expected XM22 exposures 
and ANC response in key sub-populations for select dosing regimens, and to help inform possible 
dosing strategies for children <2 years of age.  
Data 
Data for these analyses were obtained from healthy adults enrolled in 2 Phase 1 studies (XM22-01-CH 
and XM22-05-CH), adult patients with cancer enrolled in 1 Phase 2 study (XM22-02-INT) and 2 Phase 3 
studies (XM22-03 and XM22-04), and pediatric patients with cancer enrolled in 1 Phase 1 study (XM22-
07) and 1 Phase 2 study (XM22-08).  
All CTX treatments were administered intravenously and dosed based on body surface area (BSA). All 
adult patients with breast cancer received the same CTX combination of doxorubicin and docetaxel; all 
adult  patients  with  lung  cancer  received  the  same  CTX  combination  of  cisplatin  and  etoposide.  The 
CTX medications used in the pediatric patients with cancer included various combinations of vincristine, 
ifosfamide,  doxorubicin,  etoposide,  actinomycin  D,  and  cyclophosphamide.  Of  note,  vincristine 
represents the only CTX medication common across all regimens used in the pediatric population. 
The source datasets for the adult population consisted of 56 healthy subjects and 90 patients with cancer 
with a total of 2954 XM22 concentration records and 3504 ANC measurement records from cycle 1 and 
cycle  4,  where  intensive  sampling  was  performed.  The  source  datasets  for  the  pediatric  population 
consisted of 43 patients with cancer with 316 XM22 concentration records and 1576 ANC measurement 
records from cycle 1. 
Primary reasons for PK data exclusions included: 19 adult patients from Study XM22-04 who received 
placebo, 42 pre-first dose XM22 concentration records, 2 postdose XM22 concentration values that were 
BLQ, and 725 XM22 concentrations records collected during cycle 4. One entire patient was excluded 
from the analysis because this patient was not included in the sponsor’s per-protocol dataset. The PopPK 
analysis dataset after these exclusions consisted of a total of 1722 XM22 concentrations available from 
127  adult  subjects  (56  healthy  subjects  and  71  patients  with  cancer)  and  a  total  of  220  XM22 
concentrations available from 41 pediatric patients with cancer. 
During  the  course  of  exploratory  data  analysis  and  initial  PopPK  model  development,  additional 
exclusions were performed. Three XM22 concentrations identified as graphical outliers and 1 PK sample 
Lonquex EMEA/H/C/002556/II/0058/G

collected  very  late  after  administration  of  study  drug  (504  hours  post-dose)  were  excluded.  Three 
patients  each  had  excessively  high  measured  XM22  concentration  profiles  relative  to  the  rest  of  the 
analysis  population.  One  patient  exhibited  an  erratic  XM22  profile,  not  consistent  with  the  observed 
patterns in the rest of the analysis population. As such, these patients were removed from the analysis 
during PopPK model development but were subsequently reintroduced into the analysis dataset after the 
final model was identified to determine whether or not the data from these patients would detrimentally 
influence model convergence and/or considerably influence parameter estimates. After these exclusions, 
the analysis dataset used for PopPK model development consisted of a total of 1898 XM22 concentrations 
available from 164 subjects (56 healthy adult subjects, 43 adult patients with breast cancer, 26 adult 
patients with lung cancer, and 39 pediatric patients with cancer). 
The overall analysis population was primarily white (98.8%). Males (51.2%) and females (48.8%) were 
almost equally represented in the pooled analysis population. Overall, ages ranged from 2 to 73 years 
of age,  with a total of 56  healthy adult subjects 18 to 45 years of age, 53 adult patients with breast 
cancer 32 to 71 years of age, 26 adult patients with lung cancer 44 to 73 years of age, and 39 pediatric 
patients  with  cancer  2  to  18  years  of  age.  Body  weight  ranged  from  48.0  to  127.0  kg  in  the  adult 
population  and  from  12.5  to  79.8  kg  in  the  pediatric  population.  Hepatic  and  renal  function  indices 
showed that the majority of patients had generally normal liver and kidney function, with no indication 
of  severe  impairment.  The  baseline  ANC  values  (collected  just  prior  to  XM22  dosing)  were  generally 
higher in the adult patients with cancer compared to the healthy adult subjects and the pediatric patients 
with cancer. 
A dense PK sampling strategy was implemented in each of the adult studies. However, for the pediatric 
studies,  the  PK  sampling  was  less  robust.  The  comparatively  richer  PK  sampling  strategy  in  Study 
XM22-07 provided approximately twice the amount of XM22 concentration samples per patient relative 
to  Study XM22-08,  in  which  a  sparse  PK  sampling  strategy  only  yielded  a  maximum  of  3  XM22 
concentration records per patient. 
To  illustrate  the  central  tendency  of  the  XM22  concentration  time-course  in  healthy  subjects  and  in 
patients  with  cancer,  Figure  7  provides  median  XM22  concentrations  plotted  versus  time  since  first 
XM22 dose, stratified by study and dose. A consolidated display of the ANC profiles, presented by study 
and stratified by dose, are provided in Figure 8.

The  PK  profiles  from  the  healthy  subject  studies  (Studies  XM22-01-CH  and  XM22-05-CH)  generally 
peaked  approximately  12  to  48  hours  post-dose;  XM22  concentrations  then  declined  in  an  apparent 
biphasic manner, with a relatively rapid decline immediately after peak followed by a shallower slope at 
the end of the profiles. Given the considerable increase in post-dose ANC values, the rapid decline in 
XM22 concentrations after peak was most likely related to the nonlinear elimination driven by binding to 
G-CSF receptors in the elevated circulating neutrophil population. The shallower PK profile in the later 
post-dose time period, when corresponding ANC values had declined, suggested that XM22 elimination 
was  predominantly  driven  by  the  linear  component  of  clearance.  In  these  healthy  subjects,  the  ANC 
values  exhibited  a  modest  dose-related  increase  in  the  maximum  values;  the  ANC  peaks  generally 
occurred from approximately 25 to 100 hours, with a systematic trend for later peaks associated with 
higher doses. 
In contrast, the PK profiles in the patients with cancer tended to exhibit a broader and extended peak, 
with  an  apparent  dual  peak  phenomenon  observed  in  a  considerable  proportion  of  patients.  This  PK 
behaviour  was,  in  large  part,  associated  with  the  substantial  reduction  in  ANC  due  to  CTX  cytotoxic 
effects. The ANC values peaked approximately 25 to 75 hours post-dose, then rapidly reached a nadir 
at 100 to 150 hours, followed by a gradual rise back to or exceeding pre-dose baseline ANC levels. With 
the much lower ANC values around the nadir, the nonlinear clearance of XM22 became readily saturated, 
contributing  to  decreased  drug  elimination  that  manifested  as  prolonged  peak  concentrations  which 
declined  slowly.  Thereafter,  when  ANC  began  to  recover,  the  contribution  of  the  nonlinear  clearance 
component  increased,  leading  to  the  sharp  decline  in  XM22  concentrations.  Because  of  the  extended 
period in which nonlinear clearance was mostly saturated, the linear elimination phase at the end of the 
observed PK profiles in the patients with cancer was less clearly visible compared to healthy subjects. 
Two  important  features  to  note  in  the  ANC  profiles  are  that:  1)  the  adult  patients  with  lung  cancer 
exhibited a fairly modest delay in time of ANC nadir after XM22 administration and 2) a proportion of 
pediatric  patients  exhibited  lower  observed  ANC  nadirs  (<0.01×109/L)  than  the  adult  population, 
suggesting greater cytotoxic effects of CTX treatment on neutrophils. However, this latter phenomenon 
does  not  contribute  to  any  observed  apparent  delay  or  attenuation  in  ANC  recovery  back  to  baseline 
after the nadir in these patients. 
Application of the previously developed population PK model 
The  previous  PopPK  model  for  XM22  initially  developed  using  pooled  data  collected  in  adult  healthy 
subjects and adult patients with breast cancer and adult patients with lung cancer was a 1-compartment 
model with first-order absorption with a lag time, and a combination of linear and nonlinear clearance 
dependent on ANC levels. 
Following initial model application, refinements to the structural PopPK model were explored, primarily 
to accommodate the addition of the pediatric population data and to insure a robust base model prior to 
performing covariate analysis. Because the adult model included relative bioavailability for adult patients 
with cancer, an additional F1 parameter was included in the model to describe relative bioavailability in 
the pediatric patients with cancer (relative to healthy adult subjects). At this stage, the estimated F1 
values  were  0.855  and  1.13  for  adult  patients  with  cancer  and  pediatric  patients  with  cancer, 
respectively;  as  such,  these  separate  F1  terms  were  kept  in  the  model  as  further  refinements  were 
tested. 
Although the effect of body weight was already included on Vc/F and the nonlinear clearance component 
Kcat/F, body weight was additionally tested on CLlin/F at the base model stage (rather than during formal 
covariate analysis) because it represented a likely strong covariate effect on XM22 disposition. Inclusion

of body weight on CLlin/F (described according to a power function) was highly statistically significant; 
therefore, this covariate-parameter relationship was incorporated into the base PopPK model. 
Following further model refinement and covariate search (forward inclusion and backwards deletion), the 
parameter estimates for the final PopPK model, along with corresponding precision estimates (%RSE), 
are provided in Table 15. 
The equations to predict the typical (population mean) values for ka, CLlin/F, Kcat/F, Vc/F, and Tlag of 
XM22 based upon the final model are, respectively, provided below in Equation 5, Equation 6, Equation 
7, Equation 8, and Equation 9. 
A prediction-corrected VPC (Bergstrand et al 2011) was performed using the final PopPK model to ensure 
the adequacy of the final model performance and to assess the predictive capabilities of the model. The 
final model was used to simulate 1000 replicates of the analysis dataset. Figure 9 illustrates the median 
and 90% PIs from the simulated datasets (blue lines) and median, 5th, and 95th percentiles from the 
observed data (red lines) overlaid on the observed XM22 concentration versus time since previous dose 
data.

Population Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Model Development 
Initially, both the PK and PD model parameters were estimated at the same time in order to characterise 
both  the  PK  of  XM22  and  the  time-course  of  ANC  response.  In  general  and  primarily  in  the  pediatric 
population,  the  fit of  the XM22  concentration-time  profiles  was  negatively  compromised,  as  NONMEM 
would sacrifice fit of the PK data in order to achieve a reasonable fit of the ANC data. In particular, the 
prolonged observed peak XM22 concentrations (that occurred due to saturation of G-CSFRs and nonlinear 
elimination when ANC levels were very low) were not appropriately captured by the model. To rectify 
this  issue,  a  sequential  PK/PD  modeling  approach  was  adopted,  in  which  the  PopPK  model  was 
established first; then the PK components of the PK/PD model were fixed to final parameter estimates 
in order to predict the XM22 exposures that were used in the PD model. Individual empiric Bayesian PK 
parameter  estimates  from  the  final  PopPK  model  were  used  to  predict  XM22  concentrations  in  each 
patient. This model incorporated the role of ANC in modulating the nonlinear elimination of XM22 and 
included the influence of statistically significant covariates predictive of XM22 PK. The PK/PD model was 
then fit to the PD data using each patient’s predicted drug exposures as the driver for ANC response. 
Thus,  IIV  in  PK  and the  resultant  XM22  exposures,  including influences  of  both  intrinsic  and  extrinsic 
factors, was adequately accounted for when the PK/PD model was applied to the PD data. 
In addition to fixing the PK portion of the PK/PD model, several other modifications were made to the 
PD model components, which were adapted from a published PK/PD model of neutrophil response to G-
CSF (Melhem et al 2018; doi:10.1111/bcp.13504). A schematic representation of this model is provided 
in Figure 10. The key aspects of this revised model, compared to the original PK/PD model, include the 
following: 
1.  Instead  of  constraining 
the 
rates 
for  neutrophil  proliferation,  maturation,  and 
elimination/turnover to be the same value (ie, kprol = ktr = kcirc; where ktr is first-order transfer 
rate constant representing the neutrophil maturation process) as was done in the previous PK/PD 
model, each of these rate constants was represented by separate estimates/values. 
2.  The  kprol  term  (which  served  as  a  first-order  rate  constant  for  neutrophil  proliferation  in  the 
previous  PK/PD  model)  was  changed  to  a  zero-order  rate  constant  describing  neutrophil 
production.

3.  The  site  of  CTX  effect  on  granulopoiesis  was  moved  to  a  different  compartment  along  the 
catenary  chain  describing  neutrophil  dynamics.  Originally,  the  cytotoxic  effects  of  CTX  were 
placed  on  the  neutrophil  proliferating  compartment,  in  which  CTX  exposures  contributed  to  a 
first-order  irreversible  elimination  of  these  progenitor  neutrophils.  In  the  revised  model,  CTX 
effects were placed on the mitotic compartment (ie, the second compartment along the catenary 
chain  directly  connected  to  and  downstream  of  the  proliferating  compartment).  A  kinetic-
pharmacodynamic  (K-PD)  approach  was  used,  in  which  the  elimination  rate  of  the  mitotic 
precursor cells was proportional to the rate of change in CTX concentrations. 
4.  Lag times were included to account for the temporal delay between CTX administration and the 
subsequent effects on elimination of neutrophils from the mitotic compartment.

The population PK/PD model parameter estimates and their associated precisions (%RSE) are 
presented in 
Table 16. 
The estimate of kprol in the adult cancer patient population was 0.044 nM/h, while a 23% lower kprol 
(0.034 nM/h) was estimated for the pediatric cancer population. Models estimating ktr,  kcirc,  and kD 
(either separately or in combination) were tested; however, model convergence was either not successful 
or reasonable estimates for each of these parameters was unobtainable. Therefore, values for each of 
these parameters were fixed to previously published values (Melhem et al 2018). The value for ktr was 
fixed to 0.033 L/h (which equates to a neutrophil mean maturation time [MTT] of 5 days), as described 
in  Equation 10,  where  Ncmt  represents  the  number  of  transit  compartments  (not  including  the  initial 
proliferating stem cell compartment) used to describe neutrophil maturation.

The kcirc rate constant was fixed to a value of 0.12 L/h, which represents an approximate 6-hour half-
life  for  mature  circulating neutrophils  in the  blood  (kcirc  =  ln(2)/6  hours).  The  maximum  stimulatory 
effect  of  XM22  on  neutrophil  proliferation  (STM1)  and  the  maximum  stimulatory  effect  of  XM22  on 
neutrophil  maturation  (STM2)  were  estimated  to  be  1.7  and  3.0,  respectively.    The  STM1  and  STM2 
parameters are used in Equation 11 and Equation 12, respectively, to describe the fractional change in 
kprol and ktr as a function of the fraction of receptor-bound drug. 
The myelosuppressive effects of CTX treatment were characterized using a K-PD approach, in which the 
cytotoxic elimination of neutrophils was modeled to occur at the mitotic stage. The K-PD approach was 
necessary because CTX concentrations were not collected, only the dose.  Actual doses of CTX were used 
and the elimination rate of CTX from a  virtual compartment was estimated according to Equation 13. 
The stimulation of CTX-mediated neutrophil loss from the mitotic transit compartment (as described by 
 in Equation 14) is proportional to the change in CTX concentrations; the relative magnitude of 
this effect was described with a CHMSLx parameter (defined below), with separate estimates obtained

for each cancer group (ie, docetaxel/doxorubicin in adult patients with breast cancer, etoposide/cisplatin 
in adult patients with lung cancer, and vincristine-based CTX combination regimens in pediatric patients 
with cancer).

Simulations  
Stochastic simulations were conducted using the final PK and mechanistic population PK/PD models to 
project  XM22  exposures  and  ANC  outcomes  in  children  from  newborn  to  ≤2  years  of  age  receiving 
concurrent CTX and XM22 treatment. 
To conduct the stochastic simulations in children, virtual patients were defined according to relevant age 
categories ranging from birth to 2 years of age reported in growth charts assembled from the NHANES 
database  and  published  by  the  CDC.  The  following  age  groups  were  selected  to  allow  adequate 
assessment of differences or similarity in ANC response spanning the 0- to 2-year age range: birth, 2 to 
3 months, 6 months, 12 to 13 months, 18 to 19 months, and 23 to 24 months. Within each age group, 
the  corresponding  values  of  median  body  weight  (kg)  and  recumbent  length  (ie,  height  [cm])  were 
obtained. Of note, because the current modeling analysis did not identify any differences in PK or PD 
between male and female pediatric patients, the NHANES demographic characteristics from males were 
used  for  simulations  under  the  assumption  that  females  with  the  same  demographic  and  clinical 
characteristics would experience similar XM22 exposures and resultant ANC response. 
Body  weight  values  were  used  to  calculate  XM22  dose  amounts  in  the  virtual  pediatric  population 
according  to  a  standard  body  weight-based  100μg/kg  dose;  additionally,  flat  (mg)  doses  based  on 
defined weight bands (doses of 0.6, 1.5, 2.5, 4, and 6 mg, respectively, for weight bands of ≥6 to <10 
kg, ≥10 to <20 kg, ≥20 to <30 kg, ≥30 to <45 kg, and ≥45 kg) to allow a comparison of projected 
XM22 exposures and ANC response following weight-based µg/kg and flat dosing. 
A comparison of the geometric means (90% PI) of model-predicted Cmax and AUC0-14d, stratified by 
weight bands, for the 100-μg/kg, and  weight-band–specific flat XM22 doses is provided in Table  17. 
Corresponding  boxplots  of  these  XM22  exposures,  comparing  the  100-μg/kg  and  weight-banded  flat 
XM22 doses, are displayed in Figure 12.

The currently proposed weight-band doses result in sufficiently similar exposure ranges as the clinically 
studied µg/kg dosing regimen. Although the weight-band dosing has not been studied in clinical 
settings, the dosing scheme is acceptable on the basis of similar exposures being predicted from the 
weight-band dosing scheme and the originally studied µg/kg dosing scheme.

Because  vincristine  was  the  only  chemotherapeutic  drug  common  across  all  CTX  regimens  within  the 
pediatric  analysis  population,  it  was  used  during  model  development  as  the  surrogate  CTX  regimen. 
Therefore, it was similarly used in these simulations as the trigger for CTX effects. However, it is known 
Lonquex EMEA/H/C/002556/II/0058/G

that vincristine represents a milder cytotoxic CTX relative to other CTX treatments used in the pediatric 
population and, thus, is anticipated to elicit less myelosuppressive effects, in general. Therefore, in order 
to  predict  and  explore  possible  stronger  myelosuppressive  effects  expected  from  the  combination 
CTX regimens typically administered in this younger population, the strength of the estimated vincristine 
effects  from  the  final  PK/PD  model  were  also  scaled  by  2-fold  and  3-fold  in  2  separate  simulation 
scenarios by multiplying the first-order rate constant for CTX-mediated neutrophil elimination from the 
mitotic transit compartment (STMCTX) term associated with vincristine exposures (see Equation 14) by 
2  and  3,  respectively.  Plots  overlaying  the  median  and  90%  PI  of  the  ANC  time-course  for  the  non-
scaled, 2-fold scaled, and 3-fold scaled CTX effects for a 100-μg/kg XM22 dose in the virtual pediatric 
population are provided. 
The  overarching  purpose  of  the  PK/PD  analysis  was  to  critically  evaluate  and  revise  the  previously 
developed semi-mechanistic PK/PD model using pooled data from pediatric and adult oncology patients 
to  improve  characterization  of  the  XM22-mediated  effects  on  the  time-course  of  ANC  following  CTX 
treatment. Therefore, a systematic evaluation of the overall structure, as well as individual components 
of the PK/PD model, was performed to address questions and requests set forth in the EMA’s assessment 
reports.  Improvements  in  the  mechanistic  understanding  of  the  dose–E-R  relationship  between  dose, 
XM22 concentrations,  and  ANC  in  pediatric  patients  with  cancer  2  to  <18  years  of  age  and  in  adult 
patients with cancer >18 years of age allows an important comparison of XM22 PK and PD characteristics 
between  pediatric  and  adult  patients.  This  comparison  provides  essential  information  related  to,  and 
forms  a  primary  component  for,  the  extrapolation  of  clinical  effects  of  lipegfilgrastim  from  adult  to 
pediatric  patient  populations.  Furthermore,  the  developed  model  can  also  serve  as  a  useful  tool  in 
performing  various  deterministic  and  stochastic  simulations  to  explore  and  better  understand  the 
disposition  of  XM22  along  with  the  anticipated  ANC  responses  based  on  dosing  regimens  of  interest, 
according to certain patient characteristics, or in specific sub-populations (including young children ≤2 
years of age in whom XM22 has not yet been studied). In doing so, the modeling and simulations will 
help inform future clinical trials, assist in label guidance for use in patient subgroups, and provide support 
for regulatory submission. 
The key refinements to the PK/PD model included separate values for the kprol, ktr, and kcirc parameters 
to respectively describe the rates for neutrophil proliferation, maturation, and elimination/turnover. This 
imparted greater model flexibility to describe ANC profiles compared to the previously developed model, 
which estimated a single MTT parameter that was used to define the same value for kprol, ktr, and kcirc. 
The  kprol  parameter  term  was  also  changed  to  a  zero-order  rate  constant  to  describe  neutrophil 
production  instead  of  a  first-order  rate  constant  dependent  on  the  pool  of  proliferating  precursor 
neutrophils. The site of action for CTX was moved so that the cytotoxic effects of CTX were described by 
a  first-order  irreversible  elimination  of  neutrophils  from  the  mitotic  compartment  rather  than  the 
upstream proliferating compartment. In contrast to the previous PK/PD model, shifting CTX effects to 
the  second  compartment  along  the  catenary  chain  (and  immediately  downstream  of  the  proliferating 
compartment) improved characterization of myelosuppressive effects. Inclusion of a temporal delay in 
these CTX effects was central to better capturing the time of ANC nadir. 
The  final  semi-mechanistic  PK/PD  model  was  successfully  leveraged  to  perform  a  series  of  stochastic 
simulations,  which  incorporated  the  influence  of  body  weight  and  age  on  XM22  PK,  as  well  as  the 
contribution  of  IIV  in  relevant  PK/PD  parameters,  in  order  to  predict  XM22  exposures  and  associated 
ANC  response  in  virtual  populations  of  patients,  including  children  birth  to  2  years  of  age  receiving 
hypothetical  100-μg/kg  or  flat  doses  (from  0.6  to  6  mg),  based  on  defined  weight  bands  of  interest. 
Simulations in virtual populations of adult patients with breast cancer and adult patients with lung cancer 
(assuming  a  standard  6-mg  XM22  dose)  allowed  comparisons  in  projected  XM22  concentration-time 
profiles and ANC response between this young pediatric population and the adult populations.

As  this  was  an  extrapolation  into  a  patient  population  <2  years  of  age  which  has  not  been  directly 
studied,  particular  assumptions  were  necessary  to  simplify  interpretations.  These  assumptions  were 
implemented  for  practicality,  but  it  is  understood  and  appreciated  that  these  assumptions  may  have 
limitations in the <2-year-old population. For instance, it was assumed the allometric weight scaling of 
XM22 PK could still be applied to adequately and reasonably predict the time-course of XM22 exposures 
without the need for an additional maturation function. The overall elimination of XM22 is largely via the 
target-mediated  nonlinear  clearance  pathway  governed  by  available  G-CSF  receptors  on  neutrophils. 
There  is  clinical  evidence  that  neutrophil  production  and  function  in  newborns  and  infants  develops 
rapidly over the first few weeks of life, such that neutrophil numbers and physiology are similar to adults 
by 4 weeks of age (Lawrence et al 2018). Therefore, the role of ANC on the disposition of XM22 is not 
expected to be considerably different in the <2-year-old population. 
Vincristine  was  the  only  CTX  medication  common  across  all  chemotherapeutic  regimens  administered 
within  the  pediatric  analysis  population.  As  such,  vincristine  dosing  served  as  the  most  pertinent 
surrogate  to  represent  CTX  administration  in  pediatric  patients  in  these  modeling  and  simulation 
analyses.  In  the  pediatric  studies  (XM22-07  and  XM22-08),  vincristine  was  commonly  administered 
approximately 3 days prior to XM22 dosing. However, the relative timing of the last CTX dose within a 
chemotherapeutic  regimen  administered  prior  to  the  XM22  dose  could  have  occurred  within 
approximately 1 day. Therefore, the time of vincristine dosing prior to XM22 administration was adjusted 
in the simulations to represent different timing of the most recent CTX dose (1 day prior versus 3 days 
prior), which allowed adequate exploration of the impact on ANC response in the pediatric population. 
The simulations indicate that ANC profiles following XM22 treatment in the patient population birth to 
2 years of age is not expected to show sizeable differences in clinical response compared to the studied 
2- to 18-year-old pediatric population. Additionally, the patterns in ANC response, similar regardless of 
baseline ANC or age. For baseline ANC values ranging from 1.9 to 8.5 (x109/L), the ANC recovery post-
nadir  within  each  age  group  consistently  reached  equivalent  predicted  plateau  levels  within 
approximately 12 to 14 days after CTX dose. This supports that the 100-μg/kg dose is likely to provide 
beneficial effects on ANC across all subpopulations examined. 
In  order  to  simplify  pediatric  dosing  of  lipegfilgrastim,  weight-band  dosage  tables  were  developed  to 
assist healthcare providers by assigning a fixed dose of medication for a particular body weight range, 
which should reduce the potential for medication error.  
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Observed pharmacokinetics 
Study XM22-07 
The maximum mean XM22 concentration (Cmax) was reached at 50.3 hours (292 ± 178ng/mL) in the 
2 to <6  years  group,  45.4  hours  (303  ±  144  ng/mL)  in  the  6  to  <12  years  group  and  82.2  hours 
(341 ± 381 ng/mL)  in  the  12  to  <  18  years  group.  The  corresponding  geometric  means  of  Cmax 
(coefficients  of  variation)  for  the  age  groups  were  243  ng/mL  (61.0%),  255ng/mL  (47.5%)  and  224 
ng/mL (111.6%) respectively. The average Cmax values were comparable across age groups, supporting 
the use of a body-weight adjusted dose to achieve comparable initial peak exposure levels of XM22. The 
Cmax  primarily  informs  on  absorption  rate  and  volume  of  distribution,  it  does  not  provide  much 
information on clearance (which, for lipegfilgrastim, is a combination of nonlinear and linear clearances). 
AUC0-inf would provide definitive information on the comparability of clearances (sum of nonlinear and 
linear clearance) in different age groups, and also compared to adults. However, AUC0-inf could only be 
determined for 3/7 children aged 2 to 6 years old, because of the more sparse PK sampling in this age 
group. The AUC0-inf can be considered Missing Not At Random data, because those subjects who have

an extrapolated AUC higher than 20% will be censored. Therefore, it is hard to conclude anything from 
comparing AUC values between age groups, or between children and adults. 
The  PK  data  were  also  used  as  part  of  a  population  PK/PD  model.  PK(/PD)  modelling  is  considered 
essential to characterise PK differences between children and adults; information can be “borrowed” from 
adults with dense PK data to explain the observed PK profiles in children; even if the observed paediatric 
PK  profiles  were inadequate  to  estimate  all  relevant  PK  parameters,  the  paediatric  PK  profiles  can be 
used to confirm whether some scaling of the adult PK parameters can be applied to children. Even if the 
paediatric PK data are inadequate to estimate the nonlinear component of lipegfilgrastim clearance which 
itself  is  dependent  on  the  currently  circulating  absolute  neutrophil  count,  it  is  possible  to  make  the 
following  assumptions:  i) Adults  and  children  have  the  same  number  of  G-CSF  receptors  per  each 
circulating neutrophil, ii) lipegfilgrastim has the same affinity to G-CSF receptors in adults and children, 
and iii) the G-CSF ligand-receptor complex internalisation rate is the same in adults and children. From 
these assumptions, it is possible to derive the nonlinear clearance for children, even if the neutrophil 
count profiles in children were different from those of adult neutrophil count profiles.  
Study XM22-08 
Given  that  only  sparse  PK  sampling  was  conducted,  it  was  not  possible  to  calculate  independent 
PK parameters  for  each  subject.  The  PK  data  from  this  study  were  used  as  part  of  a  population 
PK&PD model, and indeed PK(/PD) modelling is the only way to extract relevant knowledge from these 
PK data. 
PK/PD modelling  
The original type II variation submission included two population PK/PD modelling reports, CP-18-06 and 
PMX-20-07. Report CP-18-06 was the actual population PK/PD modelling report, and report PMX-20-07 
contained simulations to evaluate the impact of weight-band dosing regimens on paediatric PK and PD 
profiles. In their 1st RSI response, the MAH submitted a completely new modelling report, PMX-21-01, 
which  was  based  on  both  adult  and  paediatric  PK/PD  data.  For  reasons  of  conciseness,  the  original 
description  and  assessment  of  reports  CP-18-06  and  PMX-20-07  are  deleted  as  they  are  no  longer 
relevant to the submission. 
PK model 
The population PK model was fitted to a total of 1898 XM22 concentrations available from 164 subjects 
(56 healthy adult subjects, 43 adult patients with breast cancer, 26 adult patients with lung cancer, and 
39 pediatric  patients  with  cancer).  The  model  included  parallel  linear  and  nonlinear  clearance 
mechanisms, wherein nonlinear clearance was proportional to ANC levels of each patient at each time. 
The  population PK model  did  not  predict  ANC  levels;  as  such,  ANC  was  used  as  a  time-dependent 
covariate, and the ANC values were interpolated with next-observation-carried-backward method, which 
is the default manner in which the population PK modelling software NONMEM handles time-dependent 
covariates. All population PK parameters were estimated with acceptable precision.  
The effect of size has been incorporated into the model by scaling linear and nonlinear clearance, and 
volume of distribution, by bodyweight. Linear clearance is proportional to bodyweight raised to the power 
of  1.45,  whereas  nonlinear  clearance  is  proportional  to  bodyweight  raised  to  the  power  of  0.781. 
Consequently,  children  with  small  bodyweight  will  have  proportionally  lower  linear  clearance  versus 
nonlinear clearance, when compared to adults. Apparent values of linear and nonlinear clearance, and 
volume of distribution, are all affected by bioavailability, and a separate relative bioavailability of about 
80% is estimated for paediatric cancer patients. 
Covariance in random effects has been implemented between linear clearance and volume of distribution, 
and  between  nonlinear  clearance  and  volume  of  distribution.  All  of  these  parameters  are  affected  by 
Lonquex EMEA/H/C/002556/II/0058/G

Page 58/146 
  
 
bioavailability, and it could have been more elegant to incorporate a random effect on bioavailability, 
than  to  estimate  covariances  between  random  effects  of  PK  parameters  that  are  affected  by 
bioavailability.  
Because  the  PK  model  alone  does  not  predict  ANC,  the  observed  ANC  values  were  used  as  time-
dependent  covariates  for  the  PK  model.  No  time-dependent  interpolation  such  as  linear  or  log-linear 
interpolation  between  timepoints  was  specified  in  the  model  file.  As  such,  the  modelling  software 
(NONMEM) uses the next observed ANC value as the relevant value when calculating the rate of XM22 
elimination between observation timepoints; this may cause a small amount of additional inaccuracy in 
parameter estimation when compared to linear or log-linear interpolation, which could have been used 
at the cost of spending some extra effort in model specification. Nevertheless, the issue is not considered 
critical, and is not pursued.  
The adequacy of the PK covariate model has been evaluated via delta plots of individual PK parameter 
estimates  versus  covariates.  These  plots  reveal  very  little  deviation  between  paediatric  individual 
PK parameter predictions and “typical” PK parameter predictions which do not take individual data into 
account. On one hand, this could be interpreted as a sign of the covariate model predicting very well for 
children.  On  the  other  hand,  this  can  be  interpreted  as  a  sign  that  there  may  be  substantial  random 
effects shrinkage (eta-shrinkage) for children, and the eta-shrinkage is caused by sparsity of paediatric 
data.  Nevertheless,  the  delta  plots  indicate  that  the  PK  covariate  model  seems  to  capture  all  of  the 
relevant covariate information available in the dataset.  
Data exclusions were made on the basis of data being judged as outliers; these data were omitted from 
model-building process, but were included in the final model to determine their impact on the analysis 
results.  In  the  2nd  RSI,  the  MAH  was  requested  to  display  relevant  PKPD  modelling  results  when  the 
outliers were included in the dataset. The MAH complied, and it was verified that the inclusion of outlier 
data would not change the modelling and simulation conclusions.  
PK-PD model 
For PK-PD modelling, sequential estimation was employed, i.e. the PK model was estimated first, while 
ANC data were only considered time-dependent covariates. Then, the PK parameters were fixed and the 
PD parameters were estimated. This approach is routinely used when fitting PK-PD models. Typically, 
when  fitting  PK-PD  models,  PK  only  affects  PD  while  PD  does  not  affect  PK.  In  the  current  case  of 
lipegfilgrastim, PK affects PD by stimulating neutrophil proliferation and maturation; however, PD also 
affects PK because absolute neutrophil counts determine the extent of nonlinear clearance ( 
Figure  10).  As  such,  the  interplay  between  PK  and  PD  is  complex  in  the  current  case,  and  it  is 
understandable that sequential PK-PD modelling had to be used. 
The  PK-PD  model  structure  was  based  on  a  PK-PD  model  published  by  Melhem  et  al  2018 
(doi:10.1111/bcp.13504), which used data from 10 phase I-III studies conducted in 110 healthy adults, 
and  618  adult  and  52  paediatric  patients  on  chemotherapy  following  administration  of  filgrastim  or 
pegfilgrastim; an extensive dataset. This published model featured extreme inter-individual variability of 
CV > 200% in the parameter relating the rate of change in chemotherapeutic agent to loss of receptors 
in the mitotic compartment.  
When  translating  the  published  filgrastim/pegfilgrastim  PK-PD  model  to  lipegfilgrastim,  most  of  the 
relevant parameters were estimated, and the parameters which were fixed to some physiological value 
Lonquex EMEA/H/C/002556/II/0058/G

were mostly the same in the Melhem et al 2018 model and the currently presented model. This kind of 
application of the model is a strength from a regulatory perspective, in the sense that it prevents the 
possibility of cherry-picking physiological values for some parameters, and estimating some parameters, 
in order to arrive to a model that gives a desired result. However, it needs to be noted that the value of 
kD obtained from literature (Melhem et al 2018, doi:10.1111/bcp.13504) was specific to pegfilgrastim 
and may not directly translate to lipegfilgrastim. This is a limitation.  
In the current PK-PD model, kprol was implemented as a zero-order rate constant instead of a first-order 
proliferation rate constant (which was used in the originally submitted PK-PD model), and the cytotoxic 
effects of chemotherapy were moved from the proliferating compartment to mitotic compartment. This 
has a dramatic effect on model interpretability and extrapolation. It means that the current model will 
always  predict  a  timely  return  to  baseline  levels  after  chemotherapy,  no  matter  how  severe  the 
chemotherapy.  As  a  provocative  example,  consider  a  chemotherapy  that  would  kill  all  neutrophil 
precursors in the target compartment. In a model with first-order proliferation, this would mean that no 
rebound  can  happen  because  there  are  no  precursors  left  to  proliferate.  However,  in  the  currently 
adopted  model,  a  steady  rebound  would  happen  despite  the  extreme  chemotherapy,  because  the 
proliferating neutrophil precursors appear out of nowhere with a zero-order production rate constant. To 
conclude,  the  current  model  is  not  expected  to  generalise  to  more  severe  chemotherapies  than  what 
have been included in the model-building dataset.  
A  lagtime  on  chemotherapy  effect  was  implemented.  The  model  already  includes  a  specification  that 
chemotherapy  affects  neutrophil  precursors,  and  chemotherapy  does  not  directly  affect  ANC;  there  is 
already a delay expected between decrease in neutrophil precursor levels and decrease in ANC levels. 
As such, the need to include a specific lagtime on chemotherapy effects is counterintuitive. The need to 
include  this  additional  lagtime  likely  arises  from  the  model  specification  where  chemotherapy  affects 
neutrophil  precursor  elimination  in  the  second  maturation  compartment  (mitotic  compartment)  which 
leads  to  a  shorter  delay  between  chemotherapy  and  ANC  nadir,  than  the  typically  used  model 
specification  wherein  chemotherapy  affects  neutrophil  precursor  elimination  in  the  first  maturation 
compartment  (proliferation  compartment).  To  summarise,  the  lagtime  on  chemotherapy  effects  is  a 
“correction factor” that has not physiological interpretation.  
Of interest, the published Melhem 2018 model featured a filgrastim/pegfilgrastim volume of distribution 
that  is  proportional  to  bodyweight  raised  to  the  power  of  0.943,  linear  clearance  proportional  to 
bodyweight  raised  to  the  power  of  0.641,  and  no  bodyweight  effect  on  internalization  rate  constant. 
Thus, the published model predicts an overall low effect of bodyweight on filgrastim/pegfilgrastim PK, 
which is in contrast to the results presented for lipegfilgrastim (Table 15). However, the published article 
discussion suggests that even though the modelling dataset included children, the final model did not 
take  paediatric  data  fully  into  account.  Quoting  from  the  published  Melhem  2018  article,  Discussion 
section: Of note, some differences in parameter estimates were observed between paediatric and adult 
subjects.  Separate  estimations  of  parameters  between  adults  and  children  were  required  (e.g. 
bioavailability,  clearance,  neutrophil  production  rate,  dissociation  constant,  chemotherapy  lag-time, 
magnitude of effect and duration). The differences in model parameters between adults and paediatric 
subjects on chemotherapy may lie in the differences in the types of chemotherapy treatments between 
adults and children, and among individual children. In particular, the nontarget-mediated disposition of 
pegfilgrastim in children was typically 45% of that in adults. As the number of children in the analysis 
was  relatively  small  (n  =  16  for  filgrastim;  n  =  36  for  pegfilgrastim),  these  differences  should  be 
interpreted with caution and are likely to be highly dependent on the limited data available. Thus, detailed 
results from modelling children and adults are not included.  
It  is  noteworthy  that  within  the  published  Melhem  et  al  2018  model,  many  of  the  relevant 
filgrastim/pegfilgrastim PD parameters were dissimilar between adults and children, as described above. 
This generally weakens the argument that lipegfilgrastim exposure-response profile can be extrapolated 
Lonquex EMEA/H/C/002556/II/0058/G

from  adults  to  children.  Also,  in  the  current  PK-PD  model  23%  lower  neutrophil  production  rate  was 
estimated for children, and the random effects versus covariates plots indicate that children had a slightly 
lower  stimulatory  effect  of  lipegfilgrastim  on  neutrophil  maturation  rate.  These  observations  are 
somewhat  in  contrast  with  other  aspects  of  the  MAH  reasoning,  where  it  is  claimed  that  “neutrophil 
numbers and physiology [in children] are similar to adults by 4 weeks of age”. 
The PD model parameter estimates are displayed in Table 16. All fixed effect parameters were estimated 
with RSE <37%, with the exception of the CHMSLx slope parameters (which relate the rate of change in 
CTX concentration with the elimination of neutrophils from the mitotic compartment). These parameters 
were  likely  difficult  to  estimate  because  of  the  extremely  high  inter-individual  variability  of  400-1400 
CV%  associated  with  these  parameters.  Of  note,  extremely  high  variability  in  this  parameter  (>200 
CV%) was also reported in the population PK-PD model for filgrastim/pegfilgrastim, which was used as 
the starting point for the current analysis (Melhem et al 2018; doi:10.1111/bcp.13504). 
The estimates of CHMSLx, i.e. the parameter which defines the rate of neutrophil precursor elimination 
due to chemotherapy, were 13 mg-1 (adult patients with breast cancer), 0.65 mg-1 (adult patients with 
lung cancer), and 45,000 mg-1 (pediatric patients with cancer). It is difficult to directly interpret these 
numbers,  given  that  each  population  received  a  different  chemotherapy  regimen,  and  the  potency  of 
each chemotherapeutic agent may differ. The K-PD model does not seem to take size into account in 
any way, while at the same time the pediatric patients had generally lower observed ANC nadirs than 
adults. Taken together, the children had a lower absolute dose (mg) of chemotherapeutic agents because 
the agents were administered relative to body surface area, while at the same time the children had a 
more dramatic chemotherapeutic response. This partly explains the paediatric CHMSLx estimate, which 
is  thousands  of  times  higher  than  the  adult  value.  Another  likely  reason  for  the  very  high  paediatric 
CHMSLx value lies in the model structure: Chemotherapy affects neutrophil precursor elimination in one 
maturation compartment (called the mitotic compartment). As such, it seems to be difficult for the model 
to  capture  very  high  drops  in  ANC  levels;  even  if  all  neutrophil  precursors  in  one  compartment  were 
eliminated,  the  drop  in  ANC  levels  would  be  mitigated  by  neutrophil  precursor  influx  from  other 
compartments.  
The PD model was evaluated via VPC for each subpopulation (Figure 11). The VPC figures are adequate 
for each subpopulation, indicating that the model can correctly capture the relevant ANC trends in each 
subpopulation.  Thus,  the  model  predicts  correctly  for  the  paediatric  population  on  average.  Plots  of 
random effects versus covariates, which were supplied by the MAH in 2nd RSI response, do show a trend 
of  lower  stimulatory  effect  of  lipegfilgrastim  on  neutrophil  maturation  rate  in  children  versus  adults. 
However, the plots do not show trends inside the paediatric population. As such, the potential bias exists 
for the paediatric population as a whole and Figure 11 demonstrates that this potential bias does not 
compromise the predictions to any relevant extent.  
Simulations 
Predictions of lipegfilgrastim Cmax and two-week AUC are provided for weight-based 100µg/kg dosing 
versus weight-band dosing in five weight categories (Table 17 and Figure 12). When looking at the 
table and figures, it is relevant to compare variability between the two regimens, in addition to comparing 
the central tendencies. If the variability in weight-band dosing were higher than the variability arising 
from  100µg/kg  dose,  then  it  would  indicate  that  the  weight-bands  may  be  too  wide  to  properly 
individualize the dose.   
The currently proposed weight-band doses result in sufficiently similar exposure ranges as the clinically 
studied µg/kg dosing regimen. Although the weight-band dosing has not been studied in clinical settings, 
the dosing scheme is acceptable on the basis of similar exposures being predicted from the weight-band 
dosing scheme and the originally studied µg/kg dosing scheme. The population PK/PD model provides 
support  for  the  notion  that  efficacy  of  lipegfilgrastim  can  be  extrapolated  from  adults  to  children.

Although the PK/PD model does indicate minor differences in neutrophil physiology, such as a 23% lower 
neutrophil  precursor  production  rate  in  children  versus  adults,  the  model  overall  contains  parameter 
values  for  adults  and  children  that  are  either  identical  or  similar,  while  at  the  same  time  predicting 
neutrophil  responses  that  are  in  line  with  the  observed  data  for  both  adults  and  children.  The  model 
contains mechanistic elements, which is considered a strength.  
Pharmacodynamics 
Study XM22-07 
In the Study XM22-07 the ANC values were lower, time to ANC nadir shorter and the duration of the 
ANC recovery longer in two older children age groups (6 to <12, 12 to < 18 years of age groups). This 
result is expected, relating to the baseline characteristics with more advanced cancer stages and more 
myelosuppressive  CTX  treatments  present  in  the  older  age  groups.  Similarly,  in  the  CD3+  cells, 
expressed  in  Ewing  sarcoma  tumour  cells,  the  levels  (CD3+  max  and  AUC)  were  highest  in  the older 
children, but the time to peak CD3+ was also longer in them. This may also indicate that, during the 
recovery phase, the formation of neutrophils is inhibited more by the myelosuppressive chemotherapy 
than the formation or release of CD34+ cells. The data corresponded clearly with the values observed in 
the VIDE CTX treated group of patients, with clearly the highest peak and AUC CD3+ values, and the 
longer time to peak CD3+. 
Study XM22-08 
Based on the PD parameters studied in the XM22-08 study the higher ANC values, the shorter duration 
to  the  ANC  recovery,  as  well  as  the  longer  time  to  nadir  was  observed  in  the  lipegfilgrastim  group. 
Overall, any significant difference between the treatments was not observed in any of the PD parameters 
in the study XM22-08.  
For both treatment groups, the highest mean ANC values were observed on day 2, and the lowest mean 
ANC  values  were  observed  between  days  6  and  7  of  cycle  1.  In  the  filgrastim  group,  the  mean  ANC 
values recovered approximately to the baseline values around day 15 of cycle 1. In the lipegfilgrastim 
group, the mean ANC values were slightly higher than the baseline values on day 15 of cycle 1. During 
cycles 2 and 3, the mean ANC values were higher in the lipegfilgrastim group compared to the filgrastim 
group. When the results were stratified by age cohorts, the mean ANC values in cycle 1 appeared to be 
slightly higher in the lipegfilgrastim group compared to the corresponding age cohorts in the filgrastim 
group.  
The  geometric  mean  ANC  nadir  values  were  lowest  in  the  treatment  Cycle  2  with  lipegfilgrastim 
(0.176 × 109/L, 95% CI: 0.0665, 0.4663) and in Cycle 1 with filgrastim (0.182 × 109/L, 95% CI: 0.0771, 
0.4291).  Overall,  the  ANC  nadir  values  were  comparable  between  the  lipegfilgrastim  and  filgrastim 
treatment groups in cycles 1 to 4. 
The geometric mean AUCANC until day 15 in the lipegfilgrastim group was higher compared to filgrastim 
group  (104.9473  ×  109/L*days  vs  84.2795  ×  109/L*days;  PP  Analysis  Set).  When  the  results  were 
stratified by age cohorts and CTX regimen administered in cycle 1, there were no meaningful differences 
in the mean AUCANC values between the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatment groups. Significant age-
related differences were not observed in geometric mean ratio of mean AUCANC in Cycle 1 between the 
treatments  in  different  age  categories  and  no  meaningful  difference  in  AUCANC  ratios  between  the 
treatments were seen in the highly myelosuppressive VIDA treatment and less myelosuppressive IVA 
treatment groups.

2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  paediatric  PK  data  are  too  sparse  for  estimating  PK  parameters  via  non-compartmental  analysis, 
and  the  amount  of  paediatric  PK  data  are  overall  limited.  As  such,  modelling  is  used  to  support  the 
characterization of lipegfilgrastim PK in children and hence as the basis for dosing and extrapolation of 
efficacy from adults to paediatric patients. Moreover, the PK/PD model is used to justify the proposed 
weight-band dosing scheme, which is different from the clinically studied 100 µg/kg dosing scheme. The 
proposed weight-band dosing scheme is considered acceptable.  
The  totality  of  clinical  pharmacology  data  supports  the  paediatric  indication.  The  conducted  clinical 
studies XM22-07 and XM22-08 characterise the PK and PD of lipegfilgrastim, even though they are not 
statistically powered, blinded, confirmatory efficacy studies; together with PK/PD modelling, they can be 
used to demonstrate that the PD response is sufficiently similar in children and adults to support positive 
benefit/risk profile of lipegfilgrastim in children.

Treatments 
XM22  was  administered  approximately  24  hours  (±3  hours)  after  the  end  of  the  last  chemotherapy 
treatment  in  week  1  of  the  regimen.  XM22  administration  was  to  occur  generally  on  day  4  with 
VIDE chemotherapy;  day  3  with  VDC/IE  or  IVA  chemotherapy;  and  day  2,  3,  4,  or  6  with  VAC 
chemotherapy  (depending  on  the  specific  actinomycin  regimen  and  the  number  of  days 
cyclophosphamide  was  given).  The  commercially  available  G-CSFs  were  not  administered  during  the 
study treatment period. However, G-CSFs could be administered for subsequent chemotherapy cycles 
during the follow-up period at the discretion of the investigator. The dose level of XM22 was determined 
by the body weight, up to a maximum of 6 mg. The 100 μg/kg dose of XM22 for this study approximated 
the 6 mg dose selected for use in adult patients. 
Study results were reported by age group and by type of chemotherapy received: VIDE, VDC/IE, VAC, 
and IVA. By type of chemotherapy, a majority of patients enrolled received VIDE (5 patients received 
IVA, 4 patients VAC, and 12 patients VIDE). 
Identity of investigational products: 
Single dose of XM22 (100 μg/kg body weight), subcutaneous administration, batch numbers 1016122 
(expiry date 30-Apr-2015) and 1005510 (31-Jul-2013). Merckle Biotec, Ulm, Germany is responsible for 
the manufacturing of XM22 solution 10 mg/mL for SC injection according to Good Manufacturing Practice 
(GMP) principles and guidelines applicable to investigational medicinal products (IMP).

Prior  chemotherapy  and/or  radiotherapy  were  recorded  at  the  screening  visit.  All  concomitant 
medications received from screening to the end of study visit were recorded. 
Any G-CSF therapy after the end of study visit was recorded at the follow-up visits (180 and 360 days 
after XM22 administration). 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the pharmacokinetics of a single subcutaneous injection 
of XM22. 
The  secondary  objectives  were  to  assess  the  pharmacodynamics,  efficacy,  safety,  tolerability,  and 
immunogenicity of this single dose in the same patient population. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The  incidence  of  FN  was  addresses  as  a  primary  efficacy  variable  in  study  synopsis  and  CSR,  but 
elsewhere the DSN in Cycle 1 was mentioned as a primary efficacy endpoint. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Secondary efficacy variables included severe neutropenia and very severe neutropenia.  
The methods used to measure study variables: 
Febrile  neutropenia  was  defined  as  an  axillary  or  external  ear  temperature  >38.3°C  or  2  consecutive 
readings >37.8°C for 2 hours (e.g. 2 consecutive readings at least 2 hours apart) and ANC <0.5 x 109/L. 
ANC and vital signs including body temperature were to be obtained at screening and throughout the 
treatment period. 
Severe neutropenia was defined as ANC <0.5 x 109/L 
Very severe neutropenia was defined as ANC <0.1 x 109/L 
Sample size  
This was a non-comparative study, and no statistical assumption was used to select the sample size. The 
overall sample size of 21 was considered sufficient to allow exploratory analysis. 
Randomisation 
The study XM22-07 was an uncontrolled study. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study XM22-07 was an open label single arm study.

Statistical methods 
Definition of patient populations 
Full analysis set (FAS): All patients enrolled in this study. 
Safety analysis set (SAF): All patients enrolled and who received the study drug XM22. If all patients 
enrolled received XM22, the safety population will be identical to the FAS population. 
Per-Protocol  Set  (PPS):  All  patients  in  the  SAF  for  whom  no  major  protocol  violations  were  reported. 
Major protocol violations were determined prior to database lock at a Data Review Meeting. The major 
protocol violations included the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
violation of any inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
intake of the prohibited concomitant medications, 
developed withdrawal criteria but not withdrawn, 
received incorrect dose, 
•  missing assessments that are considered to have an effect on the results of the study. 
Primary efficacy variable: Incidence of FN 
The primary efficacy variable was the incidence of febrile neutropenia assessed in Cycle 1. Results for 
febrile  neutropenia  according  to  investigator  definition  (based  on  information  provided  by  the 
investigator on a CRF) were reported for the FAS and by protocol definition in the PP set. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 23 paediatric patients with Ewing family of tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma scheduled to receive 
chemotherapy were screened for enrolment into this study. Of the 23 patients screened, 21 patients at 
11 study  centers  in  five  countries  (Czech  Republic,  Hungary,  Poland,  Russia,  and  Ukraine)  met  entry 
criteria and were eligible for enrolment into the study. Of the two patients who were not enrolled, both 
were excluded based on inclusion criteria (age and weight). 
A total of 21 patients were enrolled (7 patients in each of 3 age groups: 2 to <6 years, 6 to <12 years, 
and 12 to <18 years). Recruitment of patients in the youngest age group (2 to <6 years) was to begin 
only after results of the pharmacodynamic and safety data for the 2 higher age strata were available and 
reviewed by the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). No patient was lost to follow-up during the follow-
up period. One patient in the age group 2 to <6 years receiving IVA died due to disease progression 
during the follow-up period.

Recruitment 
In Study XM22-07, of the 23 patients screened, 21 patients at 11 study centers in five countries. Of the 
17 study  centers  activated  for  this  study,  12  centers  screened  23  patients,  and  11  centers  enrolled 
21 patients  in  the  following  5  countries:  Czech  Republic  (1  center,  1  patient),  Hungary  (1  center, 
4 patients),  Poland  (1  center,  1  patient),  Russia  (4  centers,  7  patients),  and  Ukraine  (4  centers,  8 
patients).  
Conduct of the study 
•  Protocol amendments 
There were 5 amendments to the original protocol of 10 October 2011. 
Amendment 1 (Dated 16 December 2011) was issued before any patients were enrolled into the study. 
The manufacturer of XM22 shifted from Merckle Biotec in Germany to Teva Pharmaceuticals Europe in 
The Netherlands. 
Amendment 2 (Dated 13 December 2012) 
The  protocol  became  effective  after  14  total  patients  were  enrolled  into  the  study.  The  protocol  was 
clarified  on  XM22  administration,  which  was  allowed  on  day  2,  3,  4,  or  6  with  VAC  chemotherapy 
(depending on the specific actinomycin regimen and the number of days cyclophosphamide was given) 
Amendment 3 (Dated 19 March 2013) 
The  protocol  became  effective  after  15  total  patients  were  enrolled  into  the  study.  The  protocol  was 
changed to allow enrolment of patients with rhabdomyosarcoma who receive chemotherapy with IVA. 
Amendment 4 (Dated 19 August 2013)

Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/642324/2022 
Page 68/146 
  
 
 
 
The  protocol  became  effective  after  18  total  patients  were  enrolled  into  the  study.  The  protocol  was 
changed to allow enrolment of patients with previous chemotherapy treatment for which a G-CSF was 
recommended. The patients with body weight ≥12.5 kg from previous ≥15 kg were allowed to enroll. To 
enable  the  enrolment  of  those  children  weighing  between  12.5  kg  and  15  kg,  a  reduced  sampling 
schedule  for  pharmacokinetics  and  pharmacodynamics  (comprising  6  pharmacokinetic  and  8 
pharmacodynamic samples apart from the clinical safety and antibody samples) was defined in order to 
comply with the requirements of total blood loss in children during the study.  
Amendment 5 (Dated 18 November 2013) 
The protocol became effective after 20 total patients were enrolled into the study and clarified the new 
safety issue obtained from the Neulasta regarding capillary leak syndrome. 
•  Protocol deviations 
At  the  data  review  meeting,  no  protocol  deviations  in  the  study  were  classified  as  major.  No  patient 
discontinued from the study due to protocol deviations. A total of 21 patients (all patients) had 1 or more 
(minor)  protocol  deviations.  One  patient  should  have  received  MESNA  treatment  concomitant  with 
VIDE chemotherapy  without  confirmation  of  the  received  treatment.  In  one  patient,  in  addition  to 
IVA chemotherapy, methotrexate sodium, cytarabine, and prednisolone were administered intrathecally 
as  treatment  for  tumours  located  near  sinuses  and  meninges.  It  was  possible  that  the  additional 
treatment  could  cause  additional  bone  marrow  suppression.  This  patient  was  excluded  from  the  Per 
Protocol Set because in the second protocol violation no ANC or CD34+ measurements were available 
from the central laboratory. One patient had two protocol deviations from inclusion criteria, the patient 
should have received MESNA treatment concomitant with VIDE chemotherapy, and the patient should 
have had ANC ≥1.5 x 109/L at screening and prior to chemotherapy. The central laboratory measurement 
supported the local laboratory analysis. One patient did not have three of the planned ANC values from 
the central laboratory. 
Baseline data 
Demographics 
In Study XM22-07, all 21 patients enrolled were White and Not Hispanic or Latino. More male than female 
patients  were  enrolled  overall  (12  males  [57.1%]  and  9  females  [42.9%]).  The  2  to  <6  years  group 
contained 5 males (71.4%) and 2 females (28.6%), whereas the 6 to <12 years and 12 to <18 years 
groups contained a more even distribution, with 3 males (42.9%) and 4 females (57.1%) in the 6 to 
<12 years group, and 4 males (57.1%) and 3 females (42.9%) in the 12 to <18 years group ( 
Table 20). The overall mean age of the patients was 8.8 years (range, 2 to 16 years), including mean 
(SD) ages of 3.1 (1.2) years, 9.4 (1.3) years, and 13.7 (1.1) years in the 2 to <6 years, 6 to <12 years, 
and 12 to <18 years groups, respectively. Altogether, seven patients included were from two to three 
years old providing adequate coverage of the youngest children enrolled.

Disease characteristics 
Medical history of cancer varied in Study XM22-07 across the age groups (Table 21 
Table  21).  Most  patients  in  the  youngest  age  category  (6/7,  85.7%)  were  diagnosed  with 
rhabdomyosarcoma family of tumours, while in the older age categories, most patients were diagnosed 
with Ewing family of tumours (5/7, 71.4% and 6/7, 85.7% in the 6 to <12 years and 12 to <18 years 
groups, respectively). Within the Ewing family of tumours category, Ewing tumour of bone (ETB) was 
diagnosed for the majority of patients and peripheral primitive neuroectodermal tumour (PPNET) in oldest 
age categories, one in each. None of the patients had a history of radiotherapy. 
Most patients (16/21, 76.2%) received treatment with XM22 within 14 days of diagnosis; 2 patients in 
the  in  2  to  <6  years  group  received  treatment  with  XM22  28  days  and  56  days  following  diagnosis. 
ECOG performance status was to be assessed only for patients aged ≥12 years.

By  type  of  chemotherapy:  12  patients,  all  with  Ewings,  received  VIDE.  Of  the  9  patients  with 
rhabdomyosarcoma,  5  received  IVA  and  4  received VAC  chemotherapy.  Distribution  of  chemotherapy 
was  uneven  across  age  groups  according  to  cancer  type.  In  the  2  to  <6  years  group,  most  patients 
received IVA chemotherapy (5/7, 71.4%), 1 received VAC and 1 VIDE chemotherapy. Most patients in 
the older age groups received VIDE (5/7, 71.4% and 6/7, 85.7% in the 6 to <12 years and 12 to <18 
years groups respectively) and the remaining 3 patients received VAC.

Numbers analysed 
Of  the  21  patients  enrolled,  all  21  patients  received  XM22  and  were  evaluated  for  safety  and 
pharmacokinetics. Therefore, in this study, the FAS, the Safety analysis set, and the Pharmacokinetic 
analysis set were identical. The Per Protocol Set included 20 patients and was used to evaluate efficacy 
and pharmacodynamics, along with the FAS. One patient in the 2 to <6 years group was excluded from 
the  Per  Protocol  Set  due  to  missing  ANC  and  CD34+  data  (the  central  laboratory  received  clotted 
biosamples). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Febrile neutropenia 
In  study  XM22-07,  the  primary  efficacy  variable  was  the  incidence  of  febrile  neutropenia  assessed  in 
Cycle 1.  Results  for  febrile  neutropenia  according  to  investigator  definition  (based  on  information 
provided  by  the  investigator  on  a  CRF)  were  reported  for  the  FAS  (21  patients);  results  for  febrile 
neutropenia  according  to  protocol  definition  (based  on  vital  signs  and  central  clinical  laboratory  test 
results) were reported for the Per Protocol Set (20 patients). 
In the FAS by age group, the majority of patients (5/7, 71.4%) in the 12 to <18 years group experienced 
febrile  neutropenia,  and  3  patients  in  the  younger  age  groups.    In  the  Per  Protocol  Set  according  to 
protocol definition, 4 patients (4/20, 20.0%) experienced febrile neutropenia, and of these 3 patients in 
the oldest age category. The incidence of febrile neutropenia was highest in the oldest group who had 
received VIDE chemotherapy (Table 22).

Duration of severe neutropenia (DSN) in Cycle 1 
In the study XM22-07, the DSN in Cycle 1 was a secondary efficacy endpoint. The most frequent DSN 
overall in the Per Protocol Set was 3 to 4 days, experienced by 7 patients (7/20, 35.0%), followed by 1 
to 2 days, experienced by 5 patients (5/20, 25.0%), and 5 to 6 days, experienced by 2 patients (2/20, 
10.0%). In the Per Protocol Set, the mean DSN (SD) was 0.7 (1.2), 2.4 (1.9), and 3.1 (1.9) days in the 
2 to < 6 years, 6 to <12 years and 12 to <18 years groups, respectively.  
Incidence and duration of severe and very severe neutropenia 
In  study  XM22-07,  4  patients  experienced  very  severe  neutropenia,  all  of  whom  received  VIDE 
chemotherapy:  1  patient  (14.3%)  in  the  6  to  <12  years  group,  and  3  patients  (42.9%)  in  the  12  to 
<18 years group. For three of these patients, the very severe neutropenia lasted one to two days; for 
one patient (12 to <18 years group), the event lasted 3 to 4 days. Of the 14 patients (70.0%) who had 
severe  neutropenia  (PP  analysis  set)  12  had  had  VIDE  treatment  and  2  VAC  treatment.  Two  of  the 
patients with severe neutropenia were from the under 6 years of age group (DSN less than one day), 
and six in the two oldest age categories each. The duration of severe neutropenia lasted one to two days 
in five patients, three to four days in seven patients (all in the oldest age category), and five to six days 
in two patients (both in the oldest age category). 
ANC nadir, time to ANC nadir, and time to ANC recovery 
In study XM22-07, the mean ANC nadir was higher for the youngest age group compared with the older 
age groups, 0.88 ±0.76 x 109/L for the 2 to <6 years group compared with 0.21 ±0.35 x 109/L for the 
6 to <12 years group, and 0.37 ±0.77 x 109/L for the 12 to <18 years group. The 2 to <6 years group 
received predominantly less myelosuppressive IVA chemotherapy. By the type of chemotherapy, the 4 
patients with results in the IVA group experienced a mean ANC nadir of 1.23 ±0.71 x 109/L, compared 
with 0.85 ±0.93 x 109/L for the 4 patients in the VAC group, and 0.09 ±0.08 x 109/L for the 12 patients 
in the VIDE group.  
The  mean  times  to  ANC  nadir  from  the  start  of  chemotherapy  (from  XM22  administration)  was 
10.2 ±3.6 days (8.2 ±3.5 days) for the 2 to <6 years group, 8.3 ±1.9 days (5.3 ±1.7 days) for the 6 to 
<12 years group, and 8.6 ±0.8 days (5.0 ±1.0 days) for the 12 to <18 years group. 
The mean time of recovery to ANC ≥1.0 x 109/L (ANC ≥2.0 x 109/L) from the start of chemotherapy was 
6.2 ±5.8 days (8.8 ±5.9 days), 9.4 ±4.3 days (12.0 ±0.8 days), and 10.3 ±4.8 days (10.7 ±4.9 days) 
in 2 to <6 years, 6 to <12 years and 12 to <18 years age groups. Correspondingly, the mean time of 
recovery to ANC ≥1.0 x 109/L (ANC ≥2.0 x 109/L) from ANC nadir was 1.2 ±0.4 days (3.0 ±1.8 days), 
3.0 ±1.7 days (3.7 ±1.7 days), and 3.1 ±1.3 days (3.6 ±1.4 days). 
Two patients did not have recovery of their ANC values to ANC ≥2.0 x 109/L, both of them in 2 to <6 
years group.

Study XM22-08: An open label, randomized, active controlled, multicenter phase 2 
study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy,  pharmacokinetics,  pharmacodynamics,  safety, 
tolerability,  and  immunogenicity  of  lipegfilgrastim  100  μg/kg  body  weight  in 
comparison to filgrastim 5 μg/kg body weight in pediatric patients diagnosed with 
Ewing family of tumours or Rhabdomyosarcoma receiving chemotherapy. 
Design 
The study consisted of a screening period of up to 2 weeks; a treatment period for a maximum of 18 
weeks, which consisted of 4 cycles of CTX of 21 days each with an allowance of 14-day delay between 
each CTX cycle; and a follow-up period of up to 365 days from first IMP administration.  
Study  Period:  08  September  2015  (study  initiation  date,  first  patient  first  visit)  to  18  April  2018 
(treatment period completion date, last patient last visit). 
Methods 
Study participants 
Main inclusion and exclusion criteria  
See above the study XM22-07. 
Treatments 
Patients were randomly assigned to receive treatment with either Lonquex (lipegfilgrastim) at a dose of 
100 μg/kg BW (1 dose per cycle) or Neupogen (filgrastim) at a dose of 5 μg/kg BW (once daily for at 
least 5 consecutive days per cycle [maximum of 14 days]) in a 1:1 ratio. Where the ANC did not fall <2 
× 109/L before the end of the expected nadir, dosing with filgrastim was continued until the expected 
nadir at the discretion of the investigator. The dose was kept constant throughout each cycle and was 
based on BW measured on day 1 of each cycle. 
In each of the treatment cycles of CTX, lipegfilgrastim was administered sc on day 1 of the cycles (every 
3 weeks) approximately 24 hours (+6 hours) after the end of the last CTX administration in week 1 of 
the specific regimen. The corresponding study day 1 in different CTX regimens was calculated as shown 
below: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
ifosfamide plus vincristine plus actinomycin D (IVA): CTX-day 2+1 
vincristine  plus  actinomycin  D  plus  cyclophosphamide  (VAC):  CTX-day  1+1,  CTX-day  2+1, 
CTX-day 3+1, or CTX-day 5+1 (depending on the actinomycin schedule and the number of days 
cyclophosphamide was given) 
ifosfamide plus vincristine plus actinomycin D plus doxorubicin (IVADo): CTX-day 2+1 
vincristine  plus  doxorubicin  plus  cyclophosphamide  alternating  with  ifosfamide  plus  etoposide 
(VDC/IE): CTX-day 2+1 during cycles 1 and 3, and CTX-day 5+1 during cycles 2 and 4 
vincristine plus ifosfamide plus doxorubicin plus etoposide (VIDE) : CTX-day 3+1 
Patients were treated for a maximum of 18 weeks, which consisted of 4 cycles of CTX of 21 days each, 
with an allowance of up to a 14-day delay between each CTX cycle.

Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of lipegfilgrastim compared to filgrastim in 
children receiving CTX in a descriptive manner. 
The  secondary  objectives  were  to  assess  the  pharmacodynamics,  efficacy,  safety,  tolerability,  and 
immunogenicity of lipegfilgrastim compared to filgrastim. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the duration of severe neutropenia (DSN) in Cycle 1, defined as the 
number of days with severe neutropenia in Cycle 1 (from start of CTX until day 15). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
The secondary efficacy variables and endpoints were as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
Incidence of severe neutropenia in each cycle (1 to 4).  
Incidence of very severe neutropenia in each cycle (1 to 4).  
Incidence of febrile neutropenia per cycle and across all cycles. 
•  DSN in cycles 2 to 4 per cycle. 
•  Duration of very severe neutropenia (DVSN) in cycles 1 to 4 per cycle. 
Sample size 
In the sample size estimation, the feasibility and expected low recruitment rate in the population under 
investigation  was  considered,  and  the  published  data  on  the  G-CSF  treatments  (both  short  and  long-
acting G-CSF formulations) in children was used. Based on the DSN within Cycle 1 of about 6 days with 
the SD of about 2.6 days, a sample size of 42 (21 patients per treatment group) was expected to allow 
the estimation of mean DSN in Cycle 1 with a 95% confidence interval (CI) having a half width of 1.11 
days for each treatment group. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomly assigned to treatment through a qualified randomization service provider (eg, 
interactive response technology [IRT]). 
Blinding (masking) 
This is an open-label study and there is no blinding. 
Statistical methods 
Definition of patient populations 
Full analysis set (FAS): All patients enrolled in this study. 
Safety analysis set (SAF): All randomized patients who receive at least 1 dose of study drug.

Per-Protocol  Set  (PPS):  All  patients  in  the  SAF  for  whom  no  major  protocol  violations  were  reported. 
Major  protocol  violations  were  determined  prior  to  database  lock  at  a  Data  Review  Meeting.  Major 
protocol violations might have been included but were not limited to the following: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
violation of any inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
intake of the prohibited concomitant medications, 
received less than 75% of the intended study medication dose* / per protocol required study 
medication dose 
received non-randomized study medication 
violation of the GCP criteria resulting in the exclusion of the patient data from the study 
treatment not administered with IMP to which the patient was randomized  
insufficient ANC assessments for efficacy evaluation, specifically, at least 5 ANC assessments are 
required between day 2 and 15 
The above criteria was applied only to Cycle 1 of the treatment period. Of note, only those violations 
falling  into  the  above  categories  led  to  exclusions  if  they  influence  the  interpretability  of  the  efficacy 
study results. 
* Note that for patients who received filgrastim the sum of all scheduled doses in Cycle 1 had to be equal 
to or exceed 75% of dose planned. 
Primary efficacy variable: DSN in Cycle 1 
Duration  of  severe  neutropenia  was  defined  as  number  of  days  with  Grade  4  neutropenia  with 
ANC <0.5 × 109/L. If the ANC did not drop below 0.5 × 109/L, the DSN was set to 0. 
No formal hypothesis testing was performed since the study was descriptive in nature. Conclusions were 
limited  to  providing  estimates  of  the  means  of  treatments  and  their  differences.  DSN  in  Cycle  1  was 
summarized  by  descriptive  statistics  by  treatment,  age  group,  age  group  combined,  and  CTX 
administered in Cycle 1. 
A Poisson regression with identity link was used with factors of treatment and age cohort, and baseline 
(before IMP administration) ANC value as covariate. Based on this model the 2-sided 95% CI for the 
difference between lipegfilgrastim/filgrastim was provided (with corresponding p-values).  
Secondary efficacy variables 
• 
• 
• 
Incidence of severe neutropenia: neutropenia with ANC <0.5 × 109/L. 
Incidence and duration of very severe neutropenia: ANC <0.1 × 109/L. 
Incidence  and  duration  of  febrile  neutropenia:  body  temperature  >38.3°C  or  2  consecutive

<0.5 × 109/L or expected to be <0.5 × 109/L per cycle and across all cycles. 
DSN, DVSN, and febrile neutropenia in cycles 1 through 4 and overall (in all 4 cycles) was summarized 
descriptively, including the 95% CI for the mean by treatment, age group, and age group combined. In 
addition to age group, descriptive statistics were presented by CTX administered in Cycle 1.  
For  each  cycle  and  across  all  cycles,  stratified  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel  (CMH)  (by  age  group)  odds 
ratios (ORs) were provided to compare treatment groups and corresponding 95% CI. Similarly, estimates 
were  provided  without  stratification.  For  the  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  incidence  of  severe

neutropenia, incidence of very severe neutropenia, and incidence of febrile neutropenia, the incidence 
rates within treatment arm were calculated by cycle and across cycles and summarized using frequency 
tables (along with 95% CIs). For these variables, results were evaluated by age group and CTX regimen. 
In  addition,  for  febrile  neutropenia,  a  covariate-adjusted  analysis  by  whether  prophylactic  antibiotics 
were used was performed. 
Pharmacodynamic  variables  and  ANC  values  were  summarized  for  the  PP  analysis  set  by  treatment 
group,  age  group,  and  type  of  CTX  administered  in  Cycle  1.  Data  for  ANC  in  all  cycles  and 
pharmacodynamic variables in Cycle 1 were presented for the FAS.  
Time  to  ANC  nadir  was  summarized  by  descriptive  statistics  for  each  cycle  by  treatment  and  broken 
down by age group, and type of CTX administered in Cycle 1. Time to ANC recovery was analysed using 
the same Poisson regression models as specified for DSN. 
Missing data 
In general, for all variables only the observed data from the patients were used in the statistical analyses.  
Safety laboratory values recorded as “below detectable limit” were imputed by 50% of the applicable 
limit. 
For patients with missing ANC values at day 1 of Cycle 1, the missing value was imputed by the mean 
ANC value at day 1 of Cycle 2, 3, and 4 if at least one non-missing value in these cycles was available. 
Otherwise, the missing value on day 1 of Cycle 1 was replaced by the mean ANC value at day 1 of Cycle 
1 calculated across all randomized patients in the same treatment group with non-missing values at day 
1 of Cycle 1. 
In case of missing ANC values at day 1 of Cycle 2, 3, and 4, they were replaced with the imputed ANC 
value at day 1 of the previous cycle. In case of missing ANC values at End of Study (EOS) visit, they 
were replaced with the imputed ANC value at day 1 of Cycle 4. 
For each cycle, the above imputations were performed only for patients who entered the cycle under 
consideration. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Three groups of patients stratified by age (2 to <6 years, 6 to <12 years, and 12 to <18 years) were 
enrolled. Recruitment of the youngest age group began only after results of the ANC and safety data of 
3 patients from the middle age group, who had completed the treatment phase with lipegfilgrastim, had 
been reviewed by the Data Monitoring Committee and no significant safety signals for lipegfilgrastim that 
could prevent recruitment in the youngest age stratum had been detected. One patient (age: 3 years) 
was enrolled but was not randomized because the youngest age cohort (2 to <6 years) was not started 
at the time of enrolment. This patient was not considered as a screen failure.

Recruitment 
In  study  XM22-08,  of  the  45  patients  screened,  43  patients  at  21  centers  in  10  countries  (Belarus, 
Croatia, Czech Republic, Georgia, Hungary, Romania, Russia, Slovakia, Spain, and Ukraine) met entry 
criteria and were considered eligible for enrolment into the study. See Demographics of the treatment 
groups table for the numbers of patients enrolled by the participating country. 
Conduct of the study 
•  Protocol amendments 
There were 2 amendments to the protocol for this study, the first issued before any patients were enrolled 
and the second (accepted by the PDCO) relating to the permitted chemotherapy (VAV and IVADo), the 
specifications on the lipegfilgrastim dosing, and minor aspects of study conduct. This part is not described 
here in detail for brevity.

•  Protocol deviations 
A total of 21 (50%) patients had 1 or more protocol violations; 12 (57%) patients in the lipegfilgrastim 
group and 9 (43%) patients in the filgrastim treatment group. “Other” reasons occurred in 17 (40%) of 
the patients which included CTX administration deviation (mainly dosing error of vincristine which was 
allowed by protocol Amendment 02), confidentiality deviation, randomization procedure error, and delay 
in SAE reporting of Grade 4 laboratory results (Table 24). 
Table 24: Protocol violations by treatment group (FAS) 
One patient in the lipegfilgrastim group received a different CTX (VAIA: vincristine plus actinomycin D 
plus ifosfamide plus doxorubicin) than that allowed according to the protocol. The patient was approved 
to continue the study and was categorized according to the cohort of patients administered an IVADo 
regimen. 
The protocol violations did not lead to any withdrawal of the patients. 
Baseline data 
Demographics 
The  lipegfilgrastim  and  filgrastim  treatment  groups  were,  overall,  well  balanced  with  respect  to  age 
(mean: 9.11 and 9.37 years, respectively), sex (67% and 57% male, respectively), and race (all patients 
were white) (Table 25).

Treatment compliance 
The highest overall rate of discontinuation from treatment was observed in the filgrastim group (4 [19%] 
patients);  2  (10%)  patients  due  to  adverse  events,  1  (5%)  patient  due  to  withdrawal  of  consent  by 
oneself, and 1 (5%) patient due to withdrawal of consent by the legally acceptable representative. One 
(5%)  patient  from  the  lipegfilgrastim  treatment  group  withdrew  consent  and  discontinued  the  study 
treatment. 
Numbers analysed 
All  42  patients  randomized  received  at  least  one  dose  of  either  lipegfilgrastim  or  filgrastim  and  were 
included  in  the  Full  analysis  set.  Of  the  21  (100%)  patients  who  received  lipegfilgrastim,  20  (95%) 
patients were included in the PP analysis set and one (5%) patient in the 2 to <6 years age cohort, who 
received IVADo CTX in Cycle 1 and was excluded due to violation of inclusion/exclusion criteria. 
Of the 21 (100%) patients who received filgrastim, 19 (90%) patients were included in the PP analysis 
set; 2 (10%) patients, one in each the 6 to <12 years and 12 to <18 years age cohorts, received <75% 
of the intended study medication and were excluded from the PP analysis set. Both patients who were 
excluded from the PP analysis set received VIDE CTX in Cycle 1. 
Table 28: Summary of exclusions from analyses sets by treatment group  
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint: DSN in Cycle 1 
There  was  no  meaningful  difference  in  the  DSN  in  Cycle  1  between  the  lipegfilgrastim  (mean±SD: 
2.7±2.25 days)  and  filgrastim  (mean±SD:  2.5±2.09  days)  groups  in  the  PP  population,  the  outcome 
being consistent also in the FAS population.

In the PP population the least squares (LS) mean difference (lipegfilgrastim minus filgrastim) was 1.0 
(95% CI: –0.21, 2.26; P=0.102) and in the FAS population the difference was 0.4 (95% CI: –0.92, 1.72; 
P=0.543) by the Poisson regression analysis (Table 29).  
Table 29: Duration of severe neutropenia (days) for chemotherapy Cycle 1 by treatment 
group  
The mean (SD) DSN in the lipegfilgrastim group (PP population) was 2.0 (1.55) days in the 2 to <6 years 
age cohort, 2.8 (2.31) days in the 6 to <12 years age cohort, and 3.3 (2.88) days in the 12 to <18 years 
age cohort. The data suggests a possible association between the DSN and the age of paediatric patients, 
with longer DSN in the oldest age group. This might be attributed to the higher myelotoxicity expected 
with the doxorubicin based CTX regimens, particularly for the older paediatric patients (6 to <12 years 
and 12 to <18 years) who received a higher proportion of the VIDE CTX regimen as compared to other 
CTX regimens. In both treatment groups, the mean (SD) DSN in patients who received doxorubicin based 
CTX (VDC/IE and VIDE) in Cycle 1 was longer compared to the patients who received other CTX regimens 
(IVA or VAC). Of the 2 most frequent CTX regimens used in the study (IVA and VIDE), the mean (SD) 
DSN was shorter for patients (PP population) who received IVA compared to VIDE (lipegfilgrastim: 0.4 
[0.53] days vs 4.1 [1.54] days; filgrastim: 0.4 [0.79] days vs 3.9 [1.13] days). 
Secondary endpoint: Febrile neutropenia 
In the PP analysis set, the overall incidence of febrile neutropenia in the lipegfilgrastim group was slightly 
lower compared to the filgrastim group, 35% vs 42% (of note: a difference of one patient equalling to 
5%). However, there was no meaningful difference in the likelihood of experiencing febrile neutropenia 
in  cycles  1  to  4  in  the  lipegfilgrastim  treatment  group  as  compared  to  the  filgrastim  treated  group

(stratified CMH OR=0.67; 95% CI: 0.171, 2.600) (Table 30). Results in the FAS were consistent with 
the results obtained in the PP population. 
Table 30: Incidence of febrile neutropenia by chemotherapy cycle and treatment group

Secondary endpoint: Duration of severe neutropenia in cycles 2, 3, and 4 
When the results were stratified according to the age cohorts, no meaningful differences were observed 
between the two treatment groups in the mean DSN in cycles 2 to 4.

There were no meaningful differences between the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatment groups with 
respect to the DSN in cycles 2 to 4 (~2 days in both groups). For both lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim, 
similarly,  to  the  Cycle  1  data,  the  DSN  was  longer  in  cycles  2  to  4  in  the  adult  studies  XM22-03, 
XM22-02-INT, and XM22-04 for lipegfilgrastim and pegfilgrastim, but different types of chemotherapy 
were used in the paediatric and adult studies.

Incidence of very severe neutropenia 
In study XM22-08, the overall incidence of very severe neutropenia in the lipegfilgrastim (14/20 patients; 
70%) and the filgrastim treatment groups (13/19 patients; 68%) was similar. In addition, there was no 
meaningful difference in the likelihood of experiencing very severe neutropenia in cycles 1 to 4 in the 
lipegfilgrastim  treatment  group  compared  to  the  filgrastim  treatment  (stratified  CMH  OR=1.08; 
95% CI: 0.276, 4.197) (Table 32). Results in the FAS were consistent with the results in the PP analysis 
set (stratified CMH OR for overall incidence=0.80; 95% CI: 0.216, 2.969). 
Table 32: Incidence of very severe neutropenia (PP analysis set) 
There were no meaningful differences in the DVSN in cycles 1 to 4 between the two treatment groups. 
Mean (SD) DVSN by CTX cycle is provided below (lipegfilgrastim vs filgrastim; PP analysis set). 
•  Cycle 1: 1.4 (1.88) days versus 1.3 (1.83) days 
•  Cycle 2: 1.3 (1.65) days versus 0.8 (1.82) days 
•  Cycle 3: 1.3 (1.62) days versus 1.1 (1.43) days 
•  Cycle 4: 1.1 (1.56) days versus 0.8 (0.93) days 
Similar values for DVSN were seen in the age stratified cohort data. 
Secondary endpoint: ANC nadir, time to ANC nadir, and time to ANC recovery 
The mean time to ANC nadir in cycles 1 to 4 was similar in the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatment 
groups  (PP  analysis  set)  from  the  start  of  CTX  (range:  8.8  to  11.0  days)  or  IMP  administration 
(range: 6.1 to 8.5 days) (Table 33). The data in the FAS population was consistent with the results in 
the PP analysis set.

The mean (SD) time to ANC recovery threshold of ANC >1.0 × 109/L from CTX-day 1 in Cycle 1 was 
10.3 (4.12)  days  in the  lipegfilgrastim group  and 11.9  (6.11)  days  in the  filgrastim  group.  The  mean 
(SD) time to ANC recovery threshold of ANC >2.0 × 109/L from CTX-day 1 in Cycle 1 was 14.2 (4.99) 
days in the lipegfilgrastim group and 15.3 (3.93) days in the filgrastim group. The range in the mean 
duration to ANC >1.0 × 109/L recovery was 10.0 to 10.6 days vs. 8.2 to 11.9 days in cycles 1 to 4 in 
the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim groups, respectively. The respective ranges for the mean duration to 
ANC >2.0 × 109/L recovery were 12.3 to 15.1 days and 13.8 to 15.3 days. Poisson regression analysis 
showed consistent results with the descriptive statistics. Results in the Full analysis set were consistent 
with the results in the PP analysis set. 
The  mean  (SD)  time  to  ANC  recovery  threshold  of  ANC  >1.0  ×  109/L  from  nadir  in  Cycle  1  was 
3.1 (1.76) days in the lipegfilgrastim group and 5.3 (6.1) days in the filgrastim group. The mean (SD) 
time to ANC recovery threshold of ANC >2.0 × 109/L from nadir in Cycle 1 was 8.2 (8.30) days in the 
lipegfilgrastim group and 8.5 (7.54) days in the filgrastim group. The range in the mean duration to ANC 
>1.0 × 109/L recovery was 3.1 to 4.9 days vs. 2.4 to 5.3 days in cycles 1 to 4 in the lipegfilgrastim and 
filgrastim  groups,  respectively.  The  respective  ranges  for  the  mean  duration  to  ANC  >2.0  ×  109/L 
recovery were 5.7 to 10.1 days and 8.2 to 9.1 days. A Poisson regression analysis showed consistent 
results with the descriptive statistics. Results in the Full analysis set were consistent with the results in 
the PP analysis set. 
In  paediatric  study  XM22-08,  there  were  no  meaningful  differences  between  the  lipegfilgrastim  and 
filgrastim treatment groups in the findings for the ANC variables. 
Secondary endpoint: Time in hospital and time in the intensive care unit (ICU) due to FN or connected 
infections 
There was no difference in the incidence of hospitalization due to febrile neutropenia in Cycle 1 between 
the  treatment  groups  (1  [5%]  patient  in  12  to  <18  years  age  cohort  under  each  treatment  group; 
PP analysis  set).  The  duration  of  hospitalisation  due  to  febrile  neutropenia  was  7  days  for  the 
lipegfilgrastim  patient  and  8  days  for  the  filgrastim  patient.  In  cycles  2  to  4,  there  was  1  patient 
hospitalized in the lipegfilgrastim treatment group for a duration ranging from 6 to 10 days in each cycle. 
There were no meaningful differences between the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatment groups in the 
findings for hospitalisation.

Design 
This  was  a  Phase  2,  multicentre,  multinational,  open  label,  randomised,  active 
controlled  study  to  evaluate  the  efficacy,  pharmacokinetics,  pharmacodynamics, 
safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of lipegfilgrastim at a dose of 100 μg/kg body 
weight (BW) in comparison with filgrastim at daily doses of 5 µg/kg BW in pediatric 
patients diagnosed with the Ewing family of tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma receiving 
chemotherapy (CTX).  
A total of 42 patients were enrolled, stratified into 3 groups by age (2 to <6 years, 6 
to <12 years, and 12 to <18 years). The primary objective of this active controlled 
study was to assess the efficacy of lipegfilgrastim versus filgrastim.

Title: Multicenter, Open-label Study to Assess the Pharmacokinetics, Pharmacodynamics, Efficacy, Safety, 
Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of a Single, Subcutaneous Dose of 100 μg/kg  XM22 in 21 Children with 
Ewing Family of Tumours or Rhabdomyosarcoma 
Study identifier 
Study: XM22-07; EudraCT Number: 2011-004742-18 
Design 
This  was  a  Phase  1,  multicenter,  multinational,  open-label  study  aimed  at 
assessing the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, safety, tolerability, 
and  immunogenicity  of  a  single  subcutaneous  injection  of  lipegfilgrastim  (100 
μg/kg  body  weight  [BW])  in  children  with  Ewing  family  of  tumours  or 
rhabdomyosarcoma  scheduled  to  receive  chemotherapy  (CTX).  Lipegfilgrastim 
was  administered  approximately 24  hours  (±3  hours)  after  the  end of  the  last 
CTX treatment in week 1 of the CTX regimen. A total of 21 patients were enrolled, 
stratified into 3 groups (7 patients each) by age (2 to <6 years, 6 to <12 years, 
and 12 to <18 years). The primary objective of this non-controlled study was to 
assess the pharmacokinetics of lipegfilgrastim; exploratory efficacy assessment 
was a secondary objective of this study.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The MAH has submitted the data from two clinical studies (XM22-07 and XM22-08) in paediatric patients 
with the PIP approved by the PDCO (EMEA-001019-PIP01-10) and modifications to the PIP.  
XM22-07 
The Phase 1 study XM22-07 was a multi-national, multi-center, open-label uncontrolled single dose study 
in  21  children  with  Ewing  family  of  tumours  or  rhabdomyosarcoma  who  received  concomitant 
CTX treatment. The subjects were enrolled to three age group categories (2 to <6 years, 6 to <12 years, 
and 12 to <18 years) with seven patients in each group. The 100-μg/kg dose of XM22 (lipegfilgrastim) 
determined by the body weight up to a maximum of 6 mg was administered.  
XM22-08 
The  study  Phase  2  study XM22-08  was  a  multi-national,  multi-center, open-label,  randomized,  active 
controlled  study  in  42  children  (21  patients  per  treatment  group)  with  Ewing  Family  of  Tumours  or 
Rhabdomyosarcoma to evaluate the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, tolerability, 
and immunogenicity. The compared treatments were lipegfilgrastim 100 μg/kg BW and filgrastim 5 μg/kg 
BW add on to the background CTX therapy. The subjects were enrolled to three age group categories (2 
to <6 years, 6 to <12 years, and 12 to <18 years) with seven patients in each group per treatment arm. 
Design 
The  XM22-07  study  included  a  screening  period,  a  3-week  treatment  and  assessment  period,  and  a 
follow-up period to obtain immunogenicity samples at approximately 180 days and 360 days post dose. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/642324/2022 
Page 98/146 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The end of study visit to mark the end of the treatment period was conducted at 21 days post dose. The 
XM22-08 study had a screening period of up to 2 weeks, a treatment period for a maximum of 18 weeks 
of 4 cycles of CTX of 21 days each with an allowance of 14-day delay between each CTX cycle; and a 
follow-up period of up to 365 days from the first IMP administration. Lipegfilgrastim was administered 
SC on day 1 of each CTX treatment cycle approximately 24 hours (+6 hours) after the end of the last 
CTX administration. In trial XM22-08, filgrastim 5 μg/kg BW administered SC once daily from day 1 of 
CTX cycles 1 to 4 for at least 5 consecutive days or until ANC had returned to ≥2 × 109/L. The background 
chemotherapy regimens included IVA, VAC, VDC/IE, and VIDE anti-cancer treatments in both studies, 
and also IVADo in XM22-08. In adult studies for lipegfilgrastim, pegfilgrastim (Neulasta) was used as a 
comparator. Neulasta is not approved in the EU for children, whereas, filgrastim is licenced in children 
for the reduction in the duration of severe neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients 
treated with established cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy. For the paediatric studies, filgrastim is 
considered a suitable comparator. 
In both clinical studies patients were dosed on body weight per kg (of lipegfilgrastim at a dose of 100 
μg/kg BW in comparison with filgrastim at daily doses of 5 μg/kg BW in paediatric patients), while based 
on  PK modelling  the  proposed  recommended  dose  is  based  on  bandwidth.  Monte-Carlo  simulations 
indicate that comparable drug exposure is obtained with dosing on body weight categories (≤15kg, 15 
to 34 kg, 35 to 55 kg, and >55 kg) as with traditional weight-based lipegfilgrastim 100-μg/kg dosing. 
However, children weighing less than 15 kg, only one flat dose (1.2 mg) is proposed. This body weight 
group seems very wide, and this may result in 400 µg/kg dosing for a child weighing 3 kg and 80 µg/kg 
for a child weighing 15 kg. It should be discussed if children with low body weight are not overdosed 
with lipegfilgrastim, and if another weight category should be added. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in the study XM22-07 was the incidence of FN and the duration of severe 
neutropenia (DSN) in Cycle 1 in the XM22-08 study. The analyses were of descriptive nature only and 
no confirmatory conclusions can be drawn based on these studies. 
No  formal  efficacy  hypothesis  testing  was  performed  (XM22-07),  and  the  studies  including  the 
comparative  XM22-08  were  not  powered  to  determine  similar  efficacy  between  lipegfilgrastim  and 
filgrastim.  For  study  XM22-08  the  sample  size  of  42  patients  (21  patients  per  treatment  group)  was 
selected  based  on  practicality  and  feasibility  (expected  low  recruitment  rate  in  the  population  under 
investigation). A sample size of 21 patients per treatment group was expected to allow the estimation 
of mean DSN in Cycle 1. 
In the XM22-07 study, the groups were unbalanced by the background CTX treatment or sarcoma type 
and  because  of  this  as  well  as  for  the  limited  dataset,  the  reliable  comparison  of  the  lipegfilgrastim 
efficacy between the age categories in children is not possible. In the youngest age group, 6 of 7 (85.7%) 
patients was diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma family of tumours, while the older patients mostly had 
Ewing family of tumours (5/7, 71.4% and 6/7, 85.7% in the 6 to <12 years and 12 to <18 years groups, 
respectively). All the patients (12) with Ewing sarcoma family of tumours received VIDE chemotherapy 
and the patients with rhabdomyosarcoma either IVA or VAC chemotherapy. Overall, most of the study 
subjects (16/21, 76.2%) received treatment with XM22 within 14 days of diagnosis. The mean age of all 
patients in the study was 8.8 years (range, 2 to 16 years), including the mean (SD) ages of 3.1 (1.2) 
years, 9.4 (1.3) years, and 13.7 (1.1) years in the 2 to <6 years, 6 to <12 years, and 12 to <18 years 
groups, respectively. Additional analysis of the study data by type of CTX in addition to age group, were 
conducted in support of the primary analysis. 
In the XM22-08 study, the groups were comparable by their demographics and adequately balanced by 
their condition and background chemotherapy. In both treatment groups, the proportion of patients with 
Ewing family of tumours was slightly higher in older age cohorts (6 to <12 years and 12 to <18 years) 
and the proportion of patients with rhabdomyosarcoma was slightly higher in the youngest age cohort.

Twelve study subjects having Ewing sarcoma were enrolled in the lipegfilgrastim and 10 in the filgrastim 
group. Nine and 11 patients, respectively, had rhabdomyosarcoma. More patients having Ewing sarcoma 
(8 vs. 4) had tumour stage III or higher in the lipegfilgrastim group, while the number of patients with 
the  corresponding  cancer  stage  in  rhabdomyosarcoma  was  four  and  six  subjects,  respectively.  The 
staging was missing in three patients from the lipegfilgrastim group. The number of patients receiving 
the  more  myelosuppressive  CTX  treatments  was  the  same  (14  patients  in  the  lipegfilgrastim  and 
filgrastim group each). A substantial number of patients (all except 4) had received prior chemotherapy, 
which might have an influence on the ANC response. According to the MAH, the withdrawals occurred 
after the Cycle 1 in the higher number of patients in the filgrastim group [4 (19%) vs. 1 (5%)].  
In study XM22-07, five amendments were made of which four became effective after the first patients 
were already enrolled. The nature of these protocol changes is not expected to have an impact on the 
outcome of the trial. No protocol deviations in the study were classified as major. Of the two amendments 
in  the  study  XM22-08,  the  second  amendment  approved  by  the  PDCO  was  submitted  after  the  first 
patients  were  already  enrolled  but  is  not  expected  to  have  major  impact  on the  interpretation  of  the 
efficacy data. Of the 21 patients with 1 or more protocol violation, 12 (57%) were from the lipegfilgrastim 
group and 9 (43%) in the filgrastim group. Non-compliance to the treatment was though slightly higher 
in the filgrastim group (4/21 vs. 1/21 patients) and one patient in the filgrastim group took excluded 
concomitant medication. Since the total number of subjects was small and therefore some influence to 
the final conclusions of the study might be expected, the MAH was requested to explain in detail the 
cases of non-compliance to IMP and the use of excluded concomitant medication/treatment and evaluate 
their possible impact on the study outcome in efficacy. After evaluation of the MAH’s response, these 
events are not, however, expected to have a relevant impact on the lipegfilgrastim group response to 
treatment. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
XM22-07 (Phase 1) 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the pharmacokinetics of XM22 in different age groups 
of paediatric patients. Altogether 20.0% of patients (4/20) experienced febrile neutropenia, which was 
the primary efficacy endpoint, one patient (1/7, 14.3%) in the 6 to <12 years group and three patients 
(3/7, 42.9%) in the 12 to <18 years group. In the FAS population by the investigator definition, one 
additional subject in each <6 years and 6 to <12 age category and two in 12 to <18 years group had 
febrile  neutropenia.  Based  on  these  data  with  a  limited  sample  size  per  age  category,  there  was  a 
tendency for the longer DSN by increasing age. However, the proportion of Ewing sarcoma patients was 
higher  by  age  as  well  as  the  number  of  those  subjects  who  received  more  myelosuppressive  (VIDE) 
chemotherapy.  In  the  Full  Analysis  Set  by  type  of  chemotherapy,  of  the  8  patients  who  experienced 
febrile  neutropenia  according  to  investigator  definition,  7  patients  received  VIDE  chemotherapy, 
compared with 1 patient who received IVA, and no patient who received VAC. In addition, most patients 
(7/12) who received VIDE chemotherapy experienced febrile neutropenia, particularly in the oldest age 
group  (5/6  patients).  Thus,  the  data  does  not  necessarily  provide  any  significant  information  in 
comparison of different age groups due to different background disease and chemotherapy received. 
Of the secondary efficacy endpoints, the mean DSN (PP analysis set) was 0.7 (SD; 1.2) days in the 2 to 
<6 years group, 2.4 (SD; 1.9) days in the 6 to <12 years group, and 3.1 (SD; 1.9) days in the 12 to 
<18 years group. Of the 14 patients (70.0%) who had severe neutropenia, 12 had had VIDE treatment 
and 2 VAC treatment. Two of the patients with severe neutropenia were from the <6 years age group 
and 6 in both 6 to <12 years and 12 to <18 years group. Of the four patients who experienced very 
severe neutropenia, 1 patient (14.3%) in the 6 to <12 years group and 3 patients (42.9%) in the 12 to 
<18 years group, all had received VIDE chemotherapy. The duration of very severe neutropenia was 1

to 2 days in 3 patients and 3 to 4 days in 1 patient. The mean ANC nadir was 0.88 ±0.76 x 109/L for the 
2 to <6 years group, 0.21 ±0.35 x 109/L for the 6 to <12 years group, and 0.37 ±0.77 x 109/L for the 
12 to <18 years group. The mean ANC nadir in 4 patients receiving IVA was 1.23 ±0.71 x 109/L compared 
with the mean ANC of 0.85 ±0.93 x 109/L in 4 patients treated with VAC chemotherapy and 0.09 ±0.08 
x 109/L in 12 patients receiving VIDE therapy. This result was most likely driven by the myelosuppressive 
potential of the background chemotherapy. Two of the patients in the youngest age category did not 
reach the target ANC level of ≥2.0 x 109/L, which was discussed by the MAH also from the perspective 
of the long-term effect, and the case reports of these patients were provided. Based on the response 
showing  high  overall  fluctuation  in  the  ANC  values  over  time  in  general,  the  conclusion  of  these  two 
patients  to  have  worse  response  comparing  the  other  patients  in  the  youngest  age  group  cannot  be 
drawn and therefore the worse long-term effect within the treatment cycle cannot either be concluded. 
Furthermore, neither of these patients had ANC levels of severe neutropenia and they did not develop 
febrile neutropenia.  
XM22-08 (Phase 2) 
The  primary  endpoint,  the  duration  of  severe  neutropenia  (DSN)  in  Cycle  1  (PP  population)  showed 
similar trend between treatment arms, the mean duration being 2.7 days (SD; 2.25) in the lipegfilgrastim 
group and 2.5 days (SD; 2.09) in the filgrastim group. Due to the small sample size and wide 95% CI 
range,  the  conclusions  on  statistical  significance  are  only  descriptive.  By  the  Poisson  analysis  the 
difference between the treatments was 1.0 (95% CI; -0.21, 2.26) in PP population and 0.4 (95% CI; -
0.92, 1.72) in FAS population utilizing treatment, age cohort, and baseline ANC  values as covariates. 
The data indicates approximately similar performance of lipegfilgrastim in comparison to the filgrastim 
treated patients. No statistical difference was observed in either study populations (PP and FAS), the p-
value being 0.102 and 0.543, respectively.  
The mean (SD) DSN in patients who received doxorubicin-based CTX VDC/IE and VIDE in cycle 1 was 
longer compared to the patients who received other CTX regimens (IVA or VAC). Of the 2 most frequent 
CTX regimens administered in the study (IVA and VIDE), the mean (SD) DSN was shorter for patients 
who received IVA compared to VIDE (lipegfilgrastim: 0.4 [0.53] days vs 4.1 [1.54] days; filgrastim: 0.4 
[0.79] days vs 3.9 [1.13] days; PP Analysis Set). 
The similar trend of equal response was seen also in the secondary endpoints of the study XM22-08 in 
the  primary  PP  analysis  set.  There  were  no  meaningful  differences  between  the  lipegfilgrastim  and 
filgrastim treatment groups with respect to the incidence of severe neutropenia (85% vs 84%), febrile 
neutropenia (35% vs 42%), hospitalization due to febrile neutropenia (5% in each treatment group), 
DSN in cycle 2 to 4 (~2 days in both groups), and DVSN (~1 day in both groups). Also, no relevant 
differences between the corresponding age cohorts were found.  
The overall stratified CMH model odds ratio for the incidence of febrile neutropenia in cycles 1 to 4 was 
0.67 (95% CI: 0.171, 2.600), and the Poisson regression analysis LS mean difference for the DSN in 
cycles 2 to 4 ranging from -0.1 to -0.4. Any statistically meaningful difference was present in any of the 
CTX cycles, the p-value ranging from 0.522 to 0.846.  
The overall stratified CMH model odds ratio for the very severe neutropenia was 1.08 (95% CI: 0.276, 
4.197), and the duration of very severe neutropenia (DVSN) ranged from 1.1 to 1.4 and from 0.8 to 
1.3 days in cycles 1 to 4, in the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim groups, respectively.  
Regarding the time to absolute neutrophils count (ANC) nadir from the start of CTX or IMP administration, 
the variation in the range of mean time between the study subjects was larger in the filgrastim group 
(range:  8.8  to  11  and  6.4  to  8.5  days)  to  slightly  worse  outcome  of  around  9 days  and  6.5  days, 
respectively, seen in the lipegfilgrastim group.  
Assessment report

The range in the mean duration to ANC >1.0 × 109/L recovery from CTX-day 1 was 10.0 to 10.6 days 
vs. 8.2 to 11.9 days in cycles 1 to 4 in the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim groups, respectively. The mean 
(SD) time to ANC recovery from CTX-day 1 in cycle 1 was 10.3 (4.12) days in the lipegfilgrastim group 
and 11.9 (6.11) days in the filgrastim group. The respective ranges for the mean duration to ANC >2.0 
×  109/L  recovery  were  12.3  to  15.1  days  and  13.8  to  15.3  days.  When  the  results  were  stratified 
according to the age cohorts, there were no specific trends observed in the mean times to ANC recovery 
(>1.0 × 109/L and >2.0 × 109/L) from CTX-day 1 in both treatment groups. The mean times to ANC 
recovery (>1.0 × 109/L) from CTX-day 1 were slightly longer in patients who received doxorubicin based 
CTX regimen (IVADo, VDC/IE, and VIDE) in cycle 1 compared to the patients who received IVA or VAC 
regimens. In contrast, the mean times to ANC recovery (>2.0 × 109/L) from CTX-day 1 were slightly 
shorter in patients who received doxorubicin based CTX regimen (IVADo, VDC/IE, and VIDE) in cycle 1 
compared to the ‘patients who received IVA or VAC regimens.  
The range in the mean duration to ANC >1.0 × 109/L recovery from nadir was 3.1 to 4.9 days vs. 2.4 to 
5.3 days in cycles 1 to 4 in the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim groups, respectively. The mean (SD) time 
to ANC recovery from nadir in cycle 1 was 3.1 (1.76) days in the lipegfilgrastim group and 5.3 (6.1) days 
in the filgrastim group. The respective ranges for the mean duration to ANC >2.0 × 109/L recovery were 
5.7 to 10.1 days and 8.2 to 9.1 days. These figures show approximately similar response between the 
treatments in the ANC recovery.  
One patient was hospitalised in the lipegfilgrastim group due to febrile neutropenia in each treatment 
cycle and one patient in Cycle 1 from the filgrastim group. The duration of hospitalisation and time in 
the intensive care unit (ICU) ranged from 6 to 10 days. 
Comparison to the previous adult data (XM22-03 and -04 studies) 
When the data was compared to the results received in the adult patients in the Lonquex registration 
studies in the XM22-03 study, the mean DSN in Cycle 1 was lower in adults being 0.7±0.9 (mean±SD) 
days in the XM22 group. In the XM22-04 placebo-controlled study the corresponding figure in the XM22 
group was 0.6±1.1 days and 2.3±2.5 days in the placebo group. In the latter study, the incidence of FN 
in Cycle 1 was lower 2.4% in the XM22 group than the incidence of 5.6% in placebo group. In the current 
XM22-08 study in children, the mean DSN in Cycle 1 in the lipegfilgrastim group was 2.7±2.25 and the 
incidence of the FN in Cycle 1 25%. Thus, the outcome (the mean DSN and the incidence of FN in Cycle 
1) was clearly better in adults, but also the placebo group had better outcome in the incidence of FN in 
Cycle 1 in adults. The mean DSN in Cycle 1 was approximately the same in the patients of the current 
study  and  the  adult  study  placebo  group.  The  study  XM22-03  was  conducted  in  adult  breast  cancer 
patients scheduled to receive doxorubicin/docetaxel as routine CTX for 4 cycles, and study XM22-04 in 
patients with non-small cell lung cancer receiving cisplatin/etoposide chemotherapy for 4 cycles. These 
data in adults were not directly comparable due to the host-, disease-, and treatment-related differences 
between the compared studies, and therefore any conclusions on the similarity of the efficacy in XM22 
treatment between the children and adults cannot be drawn.  
Comparison to the other studies in the paediatric patients 
The clinical overview states that the results are in line with the published data in paediatric patients with 
Ewing sarcoma, in which patients developed febrile neutropenia in 78% of VIDE cycles with pegfilgrastim 
administration and in 56% cycles with filgrastim. Based on the report, the duration of severe neutropenia 
(6.1 days vs. 5.9 days) and the duration of febrile neutropenia (mean duration 1.4 days vs. 1.3 days) 
between  the  pegfilgrastim  and  filgrastim  regimen  was  similar.  After  less  myelosuppressive  IVA  and 
VAC chemotherapy,  the  incidence  of  febrile  neutropenia  was  0%  with  pegfilgrastim  and  5%  with 
filgrastim administration (mean duration 0.4 days vs. 0.9 days) (Wendelin et al 2005). However, these 
data were collected from the extremely limited population of five patients (age range from 10 years to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/642324/2022 
Page 102/146 
 
 
 
 
15 years of age) alternating in the pegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatment courses after a total of 59 CTX 
cycles. Another group reported febrile neutropenia in 47% of the pegfilgrastim-treated paediatric cancer 
patients after VIDE, 4% after VAC and 33% (2 of 6 cases) after VAI. This study comprised altogether 28 
paediatric patients (age range from 12 to 18 years of age) (Andre et al 2007). The mean duration of 
febrile neutropenia after VIDE cycles and stimulation with G-CSF was 6.1 days with pegfilgrastim and 
5.9 days with filgrastim in Wendelin et al (2005) published study report. After postoperative IVA and 
VAC cycles, the mean duration of severe neutropenia was 0.4 days after pegfilgrastim and 0.9 days after 
filgrastim (Wendelin et al 2005). Andre et al (2007) reported a mean duration of grade 4 neutropenia of 
3 days (range 1 to 13 days) after pegfilgrastim.  
The mean duration of severe (grade 4) neutropenia in the current study (XM22-07) was 3.1 (1.9) days 
in  the  age  range  of  12  to  18  years  old  patients  (n=6)  who  all  received  VIDE  chemotherapy,  being 
approximately  the  same  as  in  comparable  group  in  Andre  et  al  2007  study.  The  incidence  of  febrile 
neutropenia was 71.4% (95% CI; 35.9, 91.8) in the study XM22-07 vs. 47% in Andre et al 2007 study 
in the 12 to 18-year-old age group, being higher in the current study.  
The current study covers the patients from 2 years of age to the adolescents up to 18 years of age, and 
the further justification was requested on how transferable the data obtained is to the smallest children. 
The issue was resolved since the MAH withdrew this age group from the indication. 
Children below the age of 2 years 
Children aged 2 or younger were not included in the clinical studies, therefore use of Lonquex in this 
population can only be based on extrapolation of efficacy data obtained in adults and older children to 
these  younger  age  group.  An  important  issue  for  this  extrapolation  is  demonstration  of  comparable 
PK/PD relation between different age groups, for this purpose a PKPD model is build. However, the use 
of this PKPD model needs further discussion mainly because similarity in PK and PD parameters between 
children  <  2  years  of  age  and  older  children  using  similar  chemotherapy  treatment  has  not  been 
demonstrated and there are questions regarding the PK/PD model. Patients below 2-years of age are 
removed from the sought indication. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
The uncontrolled nature of the study XM22-07 comparing three different age groups sets the limits for 
the conclusions to be drawn regarding efficacy. Furthermore, only single cycle of XM22 was administered, 
whereas  multiple  cycles  would  be  given  in  the  typical  clinical  setting.  Key  efficacy  endpoints,  namely 
incidence of febrile neutropenia and duration of severe neutropenia, were consistent with those reported 
for pegfilgrastim and filgrastim (which is approved for use in paediatric cancer patients). However, in 
comparison  to  the  similar  highly  myelosuppressive  background  chemotherapy  receiving  patients,  the 
febrile neutropenia was more frequent in the current study compared to the published data. Overall, the 
response appeared to be associated with the type of chemotherapy administered rather than the age of 
the patients. 
Based on the current data, a similar trend in efficacy to filgrastim in children (indicated population) was 
seen, but the worse efficacy outcome comparing to the available lipegfilgrastim data in the adult patients, 
was present.  
In addition, it is noted, that the dose in this study is not the weight-category based dosing intended to 
be included in the labelling. However, based on the MAH’s response the variability in exposure comparing 
the  labelling  proposed  dosing  in  different  weight  categories  and  the  dosing  scheme  in  the  paediatric 
studies  was  low.  Further,  the  interindividual  variation  seem  to  be  higher  than  the  variation  observed 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/642324/2022 
Page 103/146 
 
 
 
 
between the different dosing recommendations based on weight. Therefore, the SmPC proposed dosing 
recommendation can be agreed on.   
The baseline factors that contribute to the G-CSF response and the capability as well as the rate of the 
bone marrow to produce mature neutrophils are numerous. Overall, the currently presented discussion 
and justification is still lacking on why the data from adults (and adolescents), and potentially from other 
similar products (filgrastim, pegfilgrastim), can be extrapolated to the most vulnerable youngest patients 
below 2 years of age. Therefore, the clinical benefit of lipegfilgrastim in this age group is not possible to 
be assessed. A justification on the similar neutrophil activity and G-CSF clearance mechanisms in children 
from 6 months to 2 years of age to adults and adolescents is needed to support the indication in this 
age group where no clinical data are yet available. The MAH has withdrawn the indication in paediatric 
patients below 2 years of age as well as removed 6 kg weight cut-off from indication.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The observed descriptive data provided on the efficacy in paediatric population shows similar response 
between lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim, of which the latter treatment has already been approved for the 
paediatric indications. However, no patients less than 2 years of age were included in the clinical trials 
to  support  the  indication  in  this  age  group.  The  available  efficacy  data  does  not  exclude  the  possible 
similarity between lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim in children over 2 years of age, lipegfilgrastim having a 
benefit  of  a  less  frequent  dosing  and,  therefore,  possible  better  adherence  to  treatment  in  clinical 
practice.  The  issue  related  to  the  youngest  age  group  below  2  years  of  age  resolved  since  the  MAH 
withdrew this group of patients from the indication. 
Furthermore,  it  is  noteworthy  that  the  dose  in  this  study  is  not  the  weight-category  based  dosing 
intended to be included in the labelling. However, the currently proposed weight-band doses result in 
sufficiently  similar  exposure  ranges  as  the  clinically  studied  µg/kg  dosing  regimen.  Furthermore,  the 
MAH was requested to justify why “weighing more than 6 kg” would be the appropriate weight cut-off 
for this lowest age group. The issue was resolved since the MAH removed youngest children below 2-
years of age from the indication and the proposed weight limit. 
2.5.5.  Extrapolation of efficacy  
The presented data do not contradict the possibility for the extrapolation of the efficacy and safety from 
adults to children ≥ 2 years of age from clinical perspective. See the Extrapolation section for details.

Summary of studies contributing to paediatric safety evaluation  
Study XM22-07  
Study XM22-07 was a multicentre, open label study to assess the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, 
efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a single subcutaneous dose of 100µg/kg XM22 (up 
to a maximum of 6 mg) in 21 children with Ewing family of tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma.  
Study design 
This phase 1 study included a screening period and a 3-week treatment and assessment period. The end 
of study visit was at 21 days post dose. In the follow-up period, immunogenicity samples were obtained 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/642324/2022 
Page 105/146 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
    
at approximately day 180 and day 360 post administration of XM22. This was non-comparative study 
and no statistical assumption was used to select the sample size. 21 patients were considered sufficient 
to  allow  exploratory  analysis.  No  randomization  or blinding  was  used,  but  the  study  was  designed  to 
recruit patients into 3 groups stratified by age (2 to <6 years, 6 to <12 years, and 12 to <18 years). 
Safety was assessed adverse events, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical 
laboratory  parameters,  local  injection  site  tolerability,  immunogenicity,  spleen  sonography,  and 
concomitant  medications.  Follow-up  visits  at  180  days  (±2  weeks)  and  365  days  (±2  weeks)  were 
limited to assessments of immunogenicity. 
Study XM22-08 
Study  XM22-08  was  an  open  label,  randomized,  active  controlled,  multicenter  study  to  evaluate  the 
efficacy,  pharmacokinetics,  pharmacodynamics,  safety, 
tolerability,  and 
immunogenicity  of 
lipegfilgrastim 100 μg/kg body weight (administered once per CTX cycle, up to four cycles) in comparison 
to  filgrastim  5  μg/kg  body  weight  (administered  several  times  per  CTX  cycle)  in  pediatric  patients, 
diagnosed with Ewing family of tumors or rhabdomyosarcoma receiving CTX.  
Study design  
Screening period of up to 2 weeks with a treatment period for a maximum of 18 weeks, which consisted 
of 4 cycles of CTX of 21 days each with an allowance of 14-day delay between each CTX cycle; and a 
follow-up period of up to 365 days from first investigational medicinal product (IMP) administration. An 
end of study (EOS)/or early termination (ET) visit was performed 4 weeks after the start of the last CTX 
[±3 days]). Follow-up visits were performed on days 180 (±2 weeks) and 365 (±2 weeks) after the first 
IMP administration. 
Study population /Sample size 
The sample size of 42 patients (21 patients per treatment group, 7 per each age subgroup) has been 
chosen primarily on practical grounds and feasibility. Three groups of patients stratified by age (2 to <6 
years, 6 to <12 years, and 12 to <18 years) were enrolled. No formal hypothesis was tested.  
Treatments  
In each of the treatment cycles of CTX, lipegfilgrastim or filgrastim were administered SC on day 1 of a 
cycle approximately 24 hours (+6 hours) after the end of the last CTX administration in week 1 of the 
specific  regimen.  The  corresponding  study  day  1  in  different  CTX  regimens  was  calculated  as  shown 
below: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
ifosfamide plus vincristine plus actinomycin D (IVA): CTX-day 2+1 
vincristine  plus  actinomycin  D  plus  cyclophosphamide  (VAC):  CTX-day  1+1,  CTX-day  2+1, 
CTX-day 3+1, or CTX-day 5+1 (depending on the actinomycin schedule and the number of days 
cyclophosphamide was given) 
ifosfamide plus vincristine plus actinomycin D plus doxorubicin (IVADo): CTX-day 2+1 
vincristine plus doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide alternating with ifosfamide plus etoposide 
(VDC/IE): CTX-day 2+1 during cycles 1 and 3, and CTX-day 5+1 during cycles 2 and 4 
vincristine plus ifosfamide plus doxorubicin plus etoposide (VIDE) : CTX-day 3+1 
Safety was assessed adverse events, physical examination, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), clinical 
laboratory  parameters,  local  injection  site  tolerability,  immunogenicity,  spleen  sonography,  and 
concomitant  medications.  The  following  tolerability  endpoints  were  assessed:  local  tolerability  at  the 
study drug injection site (presence and severity of pain, erythema, ecchymosis and induration), number 
(%) of patients who failed to complete the study and the number (%) of patients who failed to complete 
the study due to adverse events. In addition, the effect of treatment on mortality due to infections and 
overall  mortality  until  end  of  the  follow-up  period  were  examined.  Follow-up  visits  at  180  days  (±2

weeks) and 365 days (±2 weeks) were limited to long-term assessments: growth (height and weight), 
immunogenicity (lipegfilgrastim only), G-CSF administration, serious adverse  events (SAEs), survival, 
concomitant  medication,  and  tumor/metastases  progression.  At  day  365,  in  case  an  antibody  results 
raised concern, additional testing would be suggested. 
Patient exposure 
Exposure across all studies in cancer patients 
Overall,  a  total  of  1137  patients  have  been  randomized  and  treated  with  study  medication:  640  with 
XM22, 253 with pegfilgrastim, 21 with filgrastim, and 223 with placebo in the Phase 1 to 4 studies. 
The numbers of treated patients are summarized in following Table 37.

All 21 patients in study XM22-07 received lipegfilgrastim and were evaluated for efficacy, safety and PK.  
The range of body-weight adjusted doses administered was 98.4 to 102.6µg/kg, giving compliance close 
to  100%  for  all  patients  (range  98.4  to  105.0%).  Mean  absolute  doses  administered  were  1.76mg, 
3.68 mg and 4.58 mg respectively for the 3 age groups. Two patients received doses of XM22 slightly in 
excess of the maximum 6mg permitted (6.24 and 6.3mg), but consistent with their body weights (62.4 
and 63.0 kg respectively).  
There were no discontinuations in study XM22-07. 
Exposure to randomized study medication is summarized in Table 38.

Table 38: Study XM22-07 (Safety Population) 
XM22-08  
Overall, 42 patients in study XM22-08 received IMP (21 lipegfilgrastim, 21 filgrastim) and were evaluated 
for efficacy and safety.  Altogether 40 patients completed Day 180 follow-up, 21 in the lipegfilgrastim 
group and 19 in the filgrastim group. Out of these, 37 patients completed Day 365 follow-up, 20 in the 
lipegfilgrastim group and 17 in the filgrastim group. Two patients died during the follow-up period, both 
in  the  filgrastim  group.  One  patient  in  the  lipegfilgrastim  group  died  shortly  after  Day  365  follow-up 
completion. In the youngest age subgroup, the number of patients is limited. In study XM22-07 there 
were only three 2-year-old and no 3-year-old patients, and in study XM22-08 there were three 2-year 
old and one 3-year old patient (in all equaling to a total of 6 and 1, respectively). Furthermore, adequate 
PK data was available for only 3 children in the XM22-07 study.    
The study duration was similar between treatment groups (mean: 100.8 days in the lipegfilgrastim group 
and 95.0 days in the filgrastim group). Overall, lipegfilgrastim was administered 4 times (mean value; 
once per cycle for 4 cycles), and filgrastim was administered 31.7 times (mean value) over 4 cycles. 
The mean duration of follow-up was 269.1 days (SD=9.85, range: 247 to 288). This duration was similar 
in both treatment groups. The mean duration of follow-up was also similar across all age groups. The 
mean  duration  of  study  and  follow-up  was  369.7  days  (SD=6.68,  range:  353  to  384).  Exposure  to 
randomized study medication is summarized in Table 39.

Table 39: Extent of Exposure to IMP − study XM22-08  
The highest overall rate of discontinuation from treatment was observed in the filgrastim group (4 [19%] 
patients);  2  (10%)  patients  due  to  adverse  events,  1  (5%)  patient  due  to  withdrawal  of  consent  by 
oneself, and 1 (5%) patient due to withdrawal of consent by the legally acceptable representative. One 
(5%)  patient  from  the  lipegfilgrastim  treatment  group  withdrew  consent  and  discontinued  the  study 
treatment. Patient disposition is found in  
Figure 15 and Table 40.

Adverse events  
XM22-07 
During the treatment period, all 21 patients reported at least 1 adverse event with a total of 142 events 
reported. Twenty (95.2%) patients experienced 102 treatment-emergent adverse events. Almost twice 
as many AEs were reported in the 12 to <18 years group compared with the 2 to <6 years group (59 
and  33 events  respectively)  and  50  events  were  reported  in  the  6  to  <  12  years  group.  The  most 
frequently  occurring  treatment-emergent  adverse  event  in  all  age  groups  was  neutropenia  (11/21 
patients, 52.4%).  
One  14-year-old  male  patient  who  received  VIDE  chemotherapy  experienced  a  treatment  emergent 
adverse event of acute renal failure; this event was assessed as mild in severity, not an SAE, recovered/ 
resolved after 2 days and was assessed by the investigator as having no reasonable possibility of being 
related to XM22 treatment. 
A  total  of  3  adverse  events  in  2  patients  were  considered  by  investigators  to  be  XM22-related.  One 
patient was in the 2 to <6 years group (neutrophil count increased) and 1 patient was in the 6 to <12 
years group (back pain and bone pain). These three events were all mild in severity and consistent with 
the known safety profile of XM22. The TEAE are presented in Table 41.

XM22-08 
•  All patients were reported with at least 1 treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) during the 
study. 
• 
Incidence of various categories of TEAEs was similar between the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim 
treatment groups. 
•  Any  treatment-related  TEAEs  (as  assessed  by  the  investigator):  4  (19%)  patients  versus  2 
(10%) patients. 
•  Any Grade 3 TEAEs: 16 (76%) patients versus 13 (62%) patients. 
•  Any Grade 4 TEAEs: 16 (76%) patients in each treatment group. 
•  Any serious adverse events (SAEs): 12 (57%) patients versus 13 (62%) patients. 
Most TEAEs were reported for similar proportions of patients between the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim 
treatment  groups.  The  most  common  (≥30%  patients  in  both  the  treatment  groups)  system  organ 
classes included blood and lymphatic system disorders (86% vs 100%), gastrointestinal disorders (67% 
vs 62%), general disorders and administration site conditions (52% vs 33%), investigations (48% vs 
33%), and infections and infestations (38% vs 33%). Most TEAEs were reported at PT level for similar 
numbers of patients in each treatment group; most commonly reported in at least 50% of patients in 
any treatment group, were anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and vomiting. 
Assessment report

Non-serious TEAEs were most frequently reported (≥30% patients in any treatment group) in the SOCs 
blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders  (lipegfilgrastim:  86%;  filgrastim:  100%),  gastrointestinal 
disorders (lipegfilgrastim: 67%; filgrastim: 57%), general disorders and administration site conditions 
(lipegfilgrastim:  52%;  filgrastim:  33%),  investigations  (lipegfilgrastim:  48%;  filgrastim:  33%), 
infections  and  infestations  (lipegfilgrastim:  38%;  filgrastim:  29%),  skin  and  SC  tissue  disorders 
(lipegfilgrastim:  38%;  filgrastim:  24%),  metabolism  and  nutrition  disorders  (lipegfilgrastim:  33%; 
filgrastim: 0%), and nervous system disorders (lipegfilgrastim: 24%; filgrastim: 38%). 
Anaemia, common in cancer patients undergoing CTX, was reported for approximately 80% of patients 
in  each  treatment  group.  The  other  most  common  (≥5%  patients  in  any  treatment  group)  preferred 
terms  (PTs)  were 
thrombocytopenia  (lipegfilgrastim:  62%; 
filgrastim:  71%),  neutropenia 
(lipegfilgrastim: 52%;  filgrastim:  48%),  vomiting  (lipegfilgrastim: 52%;  filgrastim:  38%)  and  nausea 
(lipegfilgrastim: 38%; filgrastim: 33%).  
TEAEs  that  occurred  more  frequently  (difference  between  treatment  groups  ≥10%  of  patients)  with 
lipegfilgrastim than with filgrastim included vomiting, lymphopenia, decreased platelet count, alopecia, 
increased  alanine  aminotransferase,  hyperthermia,  hypokalaemia,  decreased  weight,  and  decreased 
appetite. TEAEs that occurred more frequently (difference between treatment groups ≥10% of patients) 
with  filgrastim  than  with  lipegfilgrastim  included  leukopenia,  febrile  neutropenia,  stomatitis,  and 
headache.  Based  on the  known  safety  profile of  lipegfilgrastim  and on  patients’  comorbidities  in  both 
treatment groups, no obvious reason can be found for these numerical differences. 
No notable differences in TEAEs by SOC, PT, or treatment group were observed between age cohorts. 
The  most  frequently  reported  Grade  3  TEAE  at  PT  level  was  anaemia  (11  [52%]  patients  in  the 
lipegfilgrastim  group  and  8  [38%]  patients  in  the  filgrastim  group).  Less  frequent  Grade  3  TEAE  PTs 
(reported  in  0  to  5  [24%]  patients  per  treatment  group)  included  thrombocytopenia,  neutropenia, 
lymphopenia,  febrile  neutropenia,  leukopenia,  nausea,  vomiting,  stomatitis,  decreased  platelet  count, 
increased  alanine  aminotransferase,  increased  aspartate  aminotransferase,  increased  gamma-
glutamyltransferase,  decreased  lymphocyte  count,  increased  blood  creatine  phosphokinase,  device-
related infection, and hypokalaemia. 
The most frequently reported Grade 4 TEAEs (≥30% of patients in any group), were thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia, lymphopenia, and leukopenia. Less frequent Grade 4 TEAE PTs (reported in 0 to 4 [19%] 
patients  per  treatment  group)  included  anaemia,  febrile  neutropenia,  decreased  platelet  count, 
decreased  neutrophil  count,  decreased  lymphocyte  count,  decreased  white  blood  cell  count, 
hypernatremia, hypocalcaemia, and drug-induced liver injury. 
Treatment-related  TEAEs  were  rarely  reported  in  both  treatment  groups  (4  [19%]  patients  in 
lipegfilgrastim  versus  2  patients  [10%]  in  filgrastim  group)  and  MAH  states  there  were  no  clinically 
relevant differences in the reporting of treatment-related TEAEs between treatment groups. Treatment-
related TEAEs reported in at least 1 patient in each treatment group included leucocytosis (lipegfilgrastim: 
2 [10%] patients; filgrastim: 1 [5%] patient) and monocytosis (1 [5%] patient in each group). All other 
treatment-related TEAE PTs were reported in 1 patient overall, either in the lipegfilgrastim group or in 
the  filgrastim  group.  Most  patients  had  treatment-related  TEAEs  of  either  mild  (Grade  1:  6  patients 
overall, reported in both treatment groups) or moderate severity (Grade 2: 1 patient in the lipegfilgrastim 
group only). 
Treatment-related TEAEs are further detailed below by age cohort  
•  2  to  <6  years  age  cohort:  no  patient  in  the  lipegfilgrastim  group  in  this  age  cohort  had  a 
treatment-related TEAE. One (14%) patient was reported with filgrastim-related TEAE of Grade 
1 pyrexia. 
Assessment report

•  6  to  <12  years  age  cohort:  1  (13%)  patient  in  each  SOC  was  reported  with  lipegfilgrastim-
related TEAEs of Grade 1 splenomegaly and Grade 1 back pain. In the filgrastim group, 1 patient 
(17%) each was reported with Grade 1 treatment related TEAEs of leucocytosis and monocytosis. 
•  12  to  <18  years  age  cohort:  1  (17%)  patient  in  each  SOC  was  reported  with lipegfilgrastim-
related TEAEs of Grade 1 and Grade 2 leucocytosis, Grade 1 monocytosis, and Grade 1 headache. 
None in the filgrastim group in this age cohort had a treatment-related TEAE. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
SAE  
XM22-07 
Three  patients  had  1  or  more  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  during  this  study;  1  patient  in  the  6  to 
<12 years  group  and  2  patients  in  the  12  to  <18  years  group.  All  SAEs  reported  were  febrile 
neutropaenia,  either  alone  or  in  addition  to  neutropaenia,  and  were  considered  serious  due  to 
hospitalisation  being  required.  All  3  patients  received  VIDE  chemotherapy  at  the  same  study  site  in 
Hungary.  
XM22-08 
Similar  proportions  of  patients  in  both  treatment  groups  (~60%)  were  reported  with  at  least  1  SAE 
during the study. Most SAEs occurred with similar frequencies among the treatment groups. SAEs more 
common  in  the  lipegfilgrastim  group  were  thrombocytopenia  (lipegfilgrastim  9  [43%]);  filgrastim  3 
(14%]) and lymphopenia (lipegfilgrastim 7 [33%]; filgrastim 4 [19%]); and SAEs more common in the 
filgrastim group were leukopenia (lipegfilgrastim 2 [10%]; filgrastim 5 [24%]) and febrile neutropenia 
(lipegfilgrastim 1 [5%]; filgrastim 5 [24%]). Among all SAEs, only 1 (Grade 1 pyrexia) in the filgrastim 
group was considered related to treatment. There were no SAEs that were related to the treatment with 
lipegfilgrastim. 
There were minor differences in the incidence of SAEs in the corresponding age across the treatment 
groups.  However,  given  the  low  number  of  patients  included  in  study,  these  differences  were  not 
considered clinically relevant: 
2 to <6 years: there were 5/7 (71%) patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 6/7 (86%) patients in the 
filgrastim group who experienced at least 1 SAE during the study: 
•  SAEs with higher incidence in the lipegfilgrastim (≥2 patients difference) group compared to the 
filgrastim  group:  thrombocytopenia  (3  [43%]  patients  vs  0  patients),  and  lymphopenia  (4 
[57%] patients vs 2 [29%] patients). 
•  SAEs with lower incidence in the lipegfilgrastim (≥2 patients difference) group compared to the 
filgrastim group: anaemia (2 [29%] patients vs 0 patients), leukopenia (3 [43%] patients vs 
0 patients), and febrile neutropenia (3 [43%] patients vs 0 patients). 
6 to <12 years: there were 3/8 (38%) patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 5/6 (83%) patients in 
the filgrastim group who experienced at least 1 SAE during the study: 
•  SAE with higher incidence in the lipegfilgrastim (≥2 patients difference) group compared to the 
filgrastim group: anaemia (2 [25%] patients vs 0 patients). 
• 
There were no other SAEs in this age cohort that were reported more frequently (≥2 patients 
difference) in 1 group or the other. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/642324/2022 
Page 114/146 
 
 
 
 
12 to <18 years: there were 4/6 (67%) patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 2/8 (25%) patients in 
the filgrastim group who experienced at least 1 SAE during the study: 
• 
• 
 SAEs with higher incidence in the lipegfilgrastim (≥2 patients difference) group compared to 
the filgrastim group: thrombocytopenia (4 [67%] patients vs 1 [13%] patient), and neutropenia 
(2 [33%] patients vs 0 patients). 
There were no other SAEs in this age cohort that were reported more frequently (≥2 patients 
difference) in 1 group or the other. 
Severity of SAE 
For 2 (10%) patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 4 (19%) patients in the filgrastim group, the SAEs 
were of Grade 3 severity. For 12 (57%) patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 11 (52%) patients in 
the filgrastim group, the SAEs were of Grade 4 severity. The incidence of SAEs in different age cohorts 
by toxicity grade, across the treatment groups is summarized below: 
2 to <6 years 
•  Grade 3: no patient in the lipegfilgrastim group experienced a Grade 3 SAE. Two (29%) patients 
in the filgrastim group experienced Grade 3 SAEs (anaemia in 2 patients, and febrile neutropenia, 
neutropenia, and stomatitis in 1 patient each). 
•  Grade 4: 5 (71%) patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 6 (86%) patients in the filgrastim 
group experienced Grade 4 SAEs (lymphopenia in 4 and 2 patients, thrombocytopenia in 3 and 
0 patients, febrile neutropenia in 0 and 2 patients, leukopenia in 0 and 3 patients, decreased 
lymphocyte  count  in  0  and  1  patients,  and  decreased  platelet  count  in  0  and  1  patients, 
respectively). 
6 to <12 years 
•  Grade 3: experienced by 1 (13%) patient in the lipegfilgrastim group (anaemia) and 1 patient 
(17%) in the filgrastim group (device related infection). 
•  Grade 4: 3 (38%) patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 4 (67%) patients in the filgrastim 
group experienced Grade 4 SAEs (anaemia in 1 and 0 patients, febrile neutropenia in 0 and 1 
patient, neutropenia in 0 and 1 patient, lymphopenia and thrombocytopenia in 2 patients in each 
group, leukopenia in 1 patient in each group, hypernatraemia and hypocalcaemia in 1 patient 
each in the filgrastim group). 
12 to <18 years 
• 
 Grade  3:  1  patient  each  in  the  lipegfilgrastim  group  (17%)  and  the  filgrastim  group  (13%) 
experienced Grade 3 SAEs (anaemia, nausea, and vomiting in 1 patient each in the lipegfilgrastim 
group only; and febrile neutropenia in 1 patient in filgrastim group). 
•  Grade  4:  4  (67%)  patients  in  the  lipegfilgrastim  group  and  1  (13%)  patient  in  the  filgrastim 
group experienced Grade 4 SAEs (thrombocytopenia in 4 and 1 patients, neutropenia in 2 and 0 
patients,  febrile  neutropenia  in  1  and  0  patients,  leukopenia  in  1  patient  in  each  group, 
lymphopenia in 1 and 0 patients, platelet count decreased in 1 and 0 patients, and drug-induced 
liver injury in 0 and 1 patient, respectively). 
Treatment related SAE  
XM22-07 
No treatment related SAE occurred in this study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/642324/2022 
Page 115/146 
 
 
 
 
XM22-08 
Among all SAEs, only 1 (Grade 1 pyrexia) in the filgrastim group was considered related to treatment. 
There were no SAEs that were considered related to the treatment with lipegfilgrastim. 
Serious Adverse Events in the Follow-up Period 
The  most  common  SAEs  belonged  to  the  SOC  of  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders,  in  particular 
thrombocytopenia (7 patients, 5 (24%) in lipegfilgrastim and 2 (10%) in filgrastim group), lymphopenia 
(6 patients altogether), and neutropenia (2 patients altogether). Other SAEs that occurred in more than 
one patient were lymphocyte count decreased and platelet count decreased (3 patients altogether each). 
The SAE profile was similar across all age groups with 4 (57%), 7 (88%) and 2 (33%) of patients having 
at least one SAE in three respective age groups (2 to <6 years, 6 to <12 years, 12 to <18 years) in 
patients  receiving  lipegfilgrastim.  The  corresponding  numbers  in  patients  receiving  filgrastim  were  2 
(29%) 1 (17%) 2 (25%), respectively.  
Three patients had SAEs (one of these patients died shortly after Day 365 follow-up completion) after 
database lock for the Study XM22-08 CSR (04 June 2018).  
Discontinuation  
XM22-07 
There were no discontinuations in study XM22-07. 
XM22-08 
TEAEs  leading  to  study  discontinuation  were  rare  and  reported  only  for  2  patients,  both  in  filgrastim 
group and in the age cohort 12 to <18 years, accounting for 10% of the patients in this treatment group. 
The  events  were  leukopenia  and  neutropenia  in  1  patient  and  drug-induced  liver  injury  in  the  other 
patient.  
Deaths   
XM22-07 
No deaths in this study during the 21-day treatment period following the single dose of XM22. 
XM22-08 
No deaths (Grade 5 TEAEs) were reported during the treatment period of the study. Two deaths were 
reported due to disease progression during the follow-up period (both in the filgrastim group). 
Laboratory findings 
XM22-07 
Shifts  in  serum  chemistry  toxicity  grades  from  baseline  to  end  of  study  were  small,  infrequent  and 
consistent  with  the  known  potential  effects  of  XM22  (e.g.  hypokalaemia,  increased  alkaline 
phosphatase).  One  4-year-old  boy  experienced  a  Grade  3  rise  in  alkaline  phosphatase  (from  90  to 
684U/L). Changes in haematology parameters were consistent with the known pharmacodynamic effects 
of XM22, the effect of chemotherapy and blood sampling in patients with low body weight. 
XM22-08 
There were no unexpected clinically meaningful trends observed in the mean changes from baseline for 
any of the serum chemistry or haematology parameters during the study. Individual shifts were reported 
as TEAEs in the SOC investigations in few patients in both treatment groups: ALT increased (4 [19%] 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/642324/2022 
Page 116/146 
 
 
 
 
patients in the lipegfilgrastim group and 1 [5%] patient in the filgrastim group), AST increased (3 [14%] 
and  1 [5%]),  GGT  increased  (3  [14%]  and  1  [5%]),  and  blood  bilirubin  increased  (none  in  the 
lipegfilgrastim  group  and  1  [5%]  patient  in  the  filgrastim  group).  Seven  (33%)  patients  in  the 
lipegfilgrastim  group  and 3 (14%)  patients  in  the  filgrastim  group  had  potentially  clinically  significant 
abnormal serum chemistry values. Most commonly reported (1 to 4 patients per treatment group) were: 
ALT, AST, and GGT increases. Other potential abnormalities were uncommon (0 to 1 patient per group). 
There  were  no  clinically  relevant  differences  in  the  reporting  of  potential  abnormalities  between 
treatment groups, overall and by age cohort. 
Mean  changes  in  the  haematology  parameters  from  baseline  to  EOS/or  ET  were  similar  between 
treatment groups, overall and by age cohort. These changes were not considered clinically relevant. A 
few patients had shifts from normal values at baseline to abnormal values at EOS/or ET in haematology 
parameters.  Several  individual  shifts  were  reported  as  TEAEs  in  the  SOC  investigations:  decreased 
platelet  count  (5  [24%]  patients  in  the  lipegfilgrastim  group  and  3  [14%]  patients  in  the  filgrastim 
group),  decreased  neutrophil  count  (3  [14%]  and  1  [5%]),  and  leukopenia  (3  [14%]  patients  in  the 
lipegfilgrastim group and 10 [48%] patients in the filgrastim group). Both overall and by age cohort, 
there  were  no  clinically  relevant  differences  in  the  reporting  of  shifts  for  haematology  parameters 
between  groups.  Overall,  and  by  age  cohort,  there  were  no  clinically  relevant  differences  in  the 
frequencies  of  patients  with  potentially  clinically  significant  abnormal  haematology  values  between 
treatment groups. 
ECG  
XM22-07 
QT  evaluation  was  complicated  by  the  concomitant  medications  known  to  prolong  the  QT  interval, 
including  doxorubicin,  ondansetron,  itraconazole  and  co-trimoxazole.  The  mean  increases  seen  were 
assessed in the report as likely due to the cardiotoxic effect of the chemotherapy and other circumstances 
not  related  to  XM22.  ECG  evaluation  demonstrated  no  meaningful  drug-induced  PR  interval  and  QRS 
duration prolongation or other clinically relevant abnormalities following single XM22 administration.   
XM22-08  
Lipegfilgrastim  and  filgrastim  had  no  clinically  significant  effects  on  QTc,  heart  rate,  or  cardiac 
conduction, i.e., the PR and QRS intervals. There were no clinically relevant arrhythmias or morphological 
abnormalities observed post-dosing.  
Injection site reactions 
XM22-07 
No patient experienced an injection site reaction. 
XM22-08 
One patient in the lipegfilgrastim group was reported with a TEAE of injection site pain. In the filgrastim 
group, one patient each reported TEAEs of injection site hematoma and injection site abscess.  
Splenic sonography  
XM22-07 
The  splenic  sonography  assessments  were  normal  for  all  patients  at  baseline  and  on  day  3  after 
XM22 administration. At the end of study, abnormal spleen assessments were recorded for 3 patients at 
20, 18 and 19 days (all in the 2 to <6 years group). None of these abnormalities were determined to be 
clinically significant.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/642324/2022 
Page 117/146 
 
 
 
 
XM22-08 
None  of  the  patients  had shifts  from  normal  spleen sonography  findings  at  baseline  to  abnormal  and 
clinically significant findings at the EOS/or ET visit. 
Immunogenicity 
Study XM22-07  
One  patient  developed  a  low  titer  ADA  response  in  this  study  post-treatment with  lipegfilgrastim  and 
several doses of commercial filgrastim. The patient had a positive sample at day 180 only. This sample 
was not neutralizing and only specific for the cPEG-moiety. Four other patients were considered to have 
pre-existing ADA towards lipegfilgrastim (specific for cPEG or both G-CSF and cPEG moieties), but there 
was no treatment-related ADA response. 
Study XM22-08  
Immunogenicity  data  were  obtained  only  for  patients  in  the  lipegfilgrastim  group,  thus  overall  no 
comparative data was accrued. In all, 7 samples from 4 patients were identified with confirmed presence 
of ADAs, including 3 patients with pre-existing ADAs (i.e., positive baseline samples). A single patient 
was baseline negative and had ADA positive samples at Cycle 2 CTX-day 1 and at the EOS/ET visit, but 
negative samples on day 180 and day 365. The 2 positive samples, at Cycle 2 CTX-day 1 and at EOS/ET, 
had a low titer (<1). The Cycle 2 sample for this patient had a titer of 0.5 for anticPEG, but no anti-G-
CSF specific antibodies were detected. In the EOS/ET sample, no ADA titer could be measured (0.0) due 
to very low ADA concentration. The Cycle 2 sample was non-neutralizing and the EOS/ET sample result 
was not available. 
The validation of the ECL (screening and confirmatory ADA) and the cell-based (neutralizing ADA) assays 
have previously been assessed as acceptable (EMA/H/C/002556/P46/09). 
Survival and Cancer Status in follow up period  
Study XM22-08  
Kaplan Meier estimates for 25%, 50% and 75% survival time were non-estimable due to the low number 
of death cases. Reliable evaluation of the impact of the treatment on cancer progression is impossible to 
perform  based  on  the  data  due  to  the  low  number  of  subjects  and  other  confounding  factors  (other 
treatments). 
Weight and height  
Study XM22-08  
The  mean  increases  in  weight  from  baseline  to  end  of  follow-up  was  3.17  kg  (SD=5.64)  in  the 
lipegfilgrastim group and 3.22 kg (SD=3.66) in the filgrastim group. The mean increases in height from 
baseline to end of follow-up was 3.5 cm (SD=2.7) in the lipegfilgrastim group and 4.1 cm (SD=2.6) in 
the filgrastim group. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Dedicated studies have not been performed. Due to the potential sensitivity of rapidly dividing myeloid 
cells  to  cytotoxic  chemotherapy,  Lonquex  should  be  administered  approximately  24 hours  after

administration of cytotoxic chemotherapy. Concomitant use of lipegfilgrastim with any chemotherapeutic 
medicinal product has not been evaluated in patients.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
TEAEs leading to study discontinuation were rare. None were reported in study XM22-07 and only for 
2 patients  in  study  XM22-08,  both  in  the  filgrastim  group  and  in  the  age  cohort  12  to  <18  years, 
accounting for 10% of the patients in this treatment group. The events were leukopenia and neutropenia 
in 1 patient and drug-induced liver injury in the other patient. The events were considered related to 
CTX, but not to filgrastim treatment by the investigator.  
Post marketing experience 
Lipegfilgrastim was approved in 2013 in adults and its safety profile has been well established with 7 
years of extensive use in the post-marketing setting. Cumulatively, as of 25 January 2020, the estimated 
post-marketing  exposure  to  the  Company  products  containing  lipegfilgrastim  was  approximately 
18,618,679 patient days. 
A  cumulative  search  of  the  Company  Safety  Database  from  the  date  of  launch  on  25  July  2013  until 
16 April 2020  retrieved only  one  non-serious  spontaneous  case  pertaining  to paediatric  patients.  This 
case was reported by a physician who used lipegfilgrastim off label in an unknown number of paediatric 
patients for prevention of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. No other adverse events were reported. 
No concomitant medications or patients’ details were provided either; thus, based on the very limited 
available information, no new safety findings have been identified. 
Extrapolation of safety  
As the extrapolation exercise is considered an integral part of this lipegfilgrastim pediatric extension of 
indication,  without  which  the  benefit-risk  cannot  be  determined,  details  and  discussion  on  the 
extrapolation  framework,  also  for  safety,  was  on  request  provided.  See  section  2.4.5  Extrapolation 
section/assessment for details.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  current  submission  concerns  the  paediatric  extension  of  indication  for  Lonquex  (XM22, 
lipegfilgrastim):  
Lonquex is indicated in adult and paediatric patients with 6 months of age or older for reduction 
in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients treated with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy  for  malignancy  (with  the  exception  of  chronic  myeloid  leukaemia  and  myelodysplastic 
syndromes). 
Background and exposure 
Overall, no new safety data have been provided in this submission. All the clinical studies of the MAH 
adult and pediatric development programmes, contributing to the safety evaluation, have been assessed 
in previous centralised procedures (the two clinical studies of the paediatric development programme in 
P46 centralised procedures). Safety data on MAH adult development programme are described in the 
Lonquex SmPC and on the single-dose paediatric study XM22-07, are briefly described in the Lonquex 
SmPC  (Sections  4.8,  5.1  and  5.2).  The  data  on  the  multi-dose  paediatric  study  XM22-08,  although 
assessed, was not described in the SmPC, pending this variation. In all, this submission integrates the, 
to date, accrued lipegfilgrastim clinical safety data and historical evidence, on both the paediatric patients

and adults, a novel PK/PD modelling and simulation analyses and an extrapolation exercise on the overall 
totality of data.  
The  exposure  across  all  studies  in  cancer  patients  (adults  and  paediatric  patients)  was  a  total  of 
1137 patients (randomized and treated) with study medication: 640 with XM22, 253 with pegfilgrastim, 
21 with filgrastim, and 223 with placebo.  
The MAH paediatric development programme comprises two clinical studies, a phase 1 study XM22-07 
and a phase 2 study XM22-08 (EMEA-001019-PIP01-10). They include a total of 42 patients (receiving 
lipegfilgrastim), of which 14 2-5 years, 14 6-12 years, 14 12-17 years old, contributing to the safety 
assessment of lipegfilgrastim. It was noted that, in particular, in the youngest age subgroup the number 
of patients is small: in study XM22-07 there were only three 2-year-old and no 3-year-old patients, and 
in  study  XM22-08:  3,  2-year  old  and  1,  3-year  old  patient.  In  all  equaling  to  a  total  of  6  and  1, 
respectively. Furthermore, adequate PK data was available for only 3 children in the XM22-07 study. 
Study XM22-07 was a multicentre, open label study to assess the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, 
efficacy, safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a single subcutaneous dose of 100µg/kg XM22 (up 
to a maximum of 6 mg) in 21 children with Ewing family of tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma.  
The  study  included  a  screening  period,  a  3-week  treatment  and  assessment  period,  and  a  follow-up 
period for immunogenicity at D180 and D360.  
In  this  study,  the  range  of  body-weight  adjusted  doses  of  lipegfilgrastim  administered  was  98.4  to 
102.6 µg/kg. Mean absolute doses administered were 1.76mg, 3.68 mg and 4.58 mg respectively for 
the 3 age groups. Two patients received doses of XM22 slightly in excess of the maximum 6 mg permitted 
(6.24 and 6.3mg), but consistent with their body weights (62.4 and 63.0kg respectively).  
Study XM22-08 was an open label, randomized, active controlled study in 42 children (21 patients per 
treatment  group)  with  Ewing  family  of  tumours  or  rhabdomyosarcoma  to  evaluate  the  efficacy, 
pharmacokinetics,  pharmacodynamics,  safety,  tolerability,  and  immunogenicity.  The  subjects  were 
enrolled to three age group categories (2 to <6 years, 6 to <12 years, and 12 to <18 years) with seven 
patients in each group.   
The study included a screening period, an 18-week treatment and assessment period, and a follow-up 
period with data at D180 and D360. The treatments were lipegfilgrastim 100 μg/kg BW and the active 
control  filgrastim  5  μg/kg  BW  on  a  background  of  CTX  therapy  and  a  regime  of  multiple  doses,  i.e. 
therapeutic regimes comparable to the actual clinical setting in which lipegfilgrastim will be administered 
to children.  
In  this  study,  the  mean  body-weight  adjusted  doses  administered  97.7  µg/kg/day  (range  94.8  to 
100.3 µg/kg) µg/kg and the mean total dose received was 386 µg/kg ranged from 362.5 to 401.3 µg/kg.  
In addition, it is noted, that the dose in both of these studies is not the weight-category nor weight-band 
based  dosing  intended  to  be  included  in  the  labelling.  Therefore,  safety  on  the  intended  weight 
categorised dosing cannot be directly established based on these studies.  
Safety results 
During the treatment period of the single dose study XM22-07, all 21 patients reported at least 1 adverse 
event  with  a  total  of  142  events  reported.  Twenty  (95.2%)  patients  experienced  102  treatment-
emergent adverse events. A total of 3 adverse events in 2 patients were considered by investigators to 
be  XM22-related  (2  neutrophil  count  increased)  and  1  patient  reported  back  and  bone  pain.  These  3 
events were all mild in severity and consistent with the known safety profile of XM22. No SAE or deaths 
or discontinuations were reported. No injection-site reactions occurred. In all, the safety profile for these

patients on a single dose appeared more favourable than in the study employing a multi dose regime. 
This  and  the  difference  in  the  study  design  was  considered  to  preclude  pooling  of  data,  to  allow, 
conceivably, a less biased interpretation of the results of these two small paediatric studies.  
In the treatment period of study XM22-08 the most common adverse events (≥30% patients in both 
the  treatment  groups,  i.e.  lipegfilgrastim  and  filgrastim,  respectively)  in  the  system  organ  classes 
appeared similar and included blood and lymphatic system disorders (86% vs 100%), gastrointestinal 
disorders  (67%  vs  62%),  general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (52%  vs  33%), 
investigations  (48%  vs  33%),  and  infections  and  infestations  (38%  vs  33%).  At  PT  level  for  similar 
numbers of patients in each treatment group; most common reported in at least 50% of patients in any 
treatment group, were anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and vomiting.  
TEAEs  that  occurred  more  frequently  (difference  between  treatment  groups  ≥10%  of  patients)  with 
lipegfilgrastim than with filgrastim included vomiting, lymphopenia, decreased platelet count, alopecia, 
increased alanine aminotransferase, hyperthermia, hypokalaemia, decreased weight and appetite. TEAEs 
that occurred more frequently (difference between treatment groups ≥10% of patients) with filgrastim 
than with lipegfilgrastim included leukopenia, febrile neutropenia, stomatitis, and headache.  
TEAEs by grade were reported for similar proportions of patients across treatment groups, including for 
Grade 3 TEAEs and Grade 4 TEAEs. The most frequently reported Grade 3 TEAE at PT level was anaemia 
(11  [52%]  patients  in  the  lipegfilgrastim  group  and  8  [38%]  patients  in  the  filgrastim  group).  Less 
frequent  Grade  3  TEAE  PTs  (reported  in  0  to  5  [24%]  patients  per  treatment  group)  included 
thrombocytopenia,  neutropenia,  lymphopenia,  febrile  neutropenia,  leukopenia,  nausea,  vomiting, 
stomatitis,  decreased  platelet  count,  increased  alanine  aminotransferase,  increased  aspartate 
aminotransferase, increased gamma-glutamyltransferase, decreased lymphocyte count, increased blood 
creatine  phosphokinase,  device-related  infection,  and  hypokalaemia.  The  most  frequently  reported 
Grade 4 TEAEs (≥30% of patients in any group), were thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, lymphopenia, 
and leukopenia. Less frequent Grade 4 TEAE PTs (reported in 0 to 4 [19%] patients per treatment group) 
included anaemia, febrile neutropenia, decreased platelet count, decreased neutrophil count, decreased 
lymphocyte count, decreased white blood cell count, hypernatraemia, hypocalcaemia, and drug-induced 
liver injury. Numbers age cohorts are too small for firm conclusions. 
Most SAE occurred with similar frequency (approximately 60% in both groups). A few SAEs were reported 
more frequently (>10% difference) in 1 group or the other: SAEs more common in the lipegfilgrastim 
group were thrombocytopenia (9 patients in lipegfilgrastim group; 3 patients in filgrastim group) and 
lymphopenia (7 patients in lipegfilgrastim group; 4 patients in filgrastim group). SAEs more common in 
the filgrastim group were leukopenia and febrile neutropenia. Among all SAEs, only 1 (Grade 1 pyrexia) 
in the filgrastim group was considered related to treatment. The MAH reports that there were no SAEs 
related to treatment with lipegfilgrastim (see safety reported in the follow up period).  
Interpretation of the relatedness to treatment was complicated not only by the small numbers, but also 
by  the  heterogeneity  of  underlying  disease  and  the  CTX  treatments.  On  this  background,  in  study 
XM22-08  treatment-related  TEAEs  appeared  rare,  in  both  treatment  groups  (4  [19%]  patients  in 
lipegfilgrastim versus 2 patients [10%] in filgrastim group). Among all SAEs, one (Grade 1 pyrexia) in 
the filgrastim group was considered related to treatment. There were no SAEs that were considered to 
be related to the treatment with lipegfilgrastim. Valid conclusions on age subgroup cannot be made.  
In study XM22-08 TEAEs leading to study discontinuation were rare and reported only for 2 patients, 
both in the filgrastim group. The events were leukopenia and neutropenia in 1 patient and drug-induced 
liver injury in the other patient. The events were considered related to chemotherapy. No deaths were

reported during the treatment period. Two deaths were reported due to disease progression during the 
follow-up period (both in the filgrastim group). No clear differences were evident in the chemotherapy 
treatment groups and age cohorts for the AE, TEAE, SAE and treatment related TEAE. However, valid 
conclusions on the subgroups cannot be made, because of the small numbers.   
In the follow up period of study XM22-08, altogether 3 patients of 42 patients continuing the study died 
during the follow up period with 1 patient from the lipegfilgrastim group. Acknowledging the limitations 
of assessment of these data, no trends on increased progression of the underlying disease or mortality 
was seen associated with lipegfilgrastim in comparison to filgrastim group. However, a higher percentage 
of patients with SAE’s was seen in the lipegfilgrastim group compared filgrastim (62% vs. 24%), relating 
mainly to differences in haematological changes (thrombocytopenia and leukopenia). The percentage of 
patients experiencing these SAEs in lipegfilgrastim group appeared not to differ from the data obtained 
from the primary treatment period, and these findings could plausibly even be caused by the underlying 
disease and their treatments. 
Comparison to historical adult data 
It is recognised that the interpretation of the comparisons of adult and the accrued paediatric data are 
complicated by heterogeneity patient study samples and study design; by heterogeneity of underlying 
disease and underlying cancer treatments. This underlines the need to interpret these data with caution.  
Bearing  this  in  mind,  in  comparison  to  the  safety  profile  of  Lonquex  in  adults,  the  safety  profile  in 
paediatric  patients  seemed  overall  largely  similar.  However,  some  differences  were  also  seen.  For 
example, in the adult Lonquex SmPC Section 4.8 the musculoskeletal pain was a common occurrence in 
adults, whereas, it was seen very seldomly in children. Furthermore, the frequency of thrombocytopenia 
was higher in children (62%; out of which 43% severe), whereas, the frequency in adult SmPC is <10%. 
On the other hand, the adult SmPC does not include for example vomiting (seen in 52% of children), 
and anemia (80%; of which 14% were severe), among also several other TEAEs.  
Considering  the  slightly  different  safety  profile  of  lipegfilgrastim  in  paediatric  patients  compared  to 
adults,  and  seen  in  comparison  to  the  active  control  filgrastim  (in  both  the  treatment  and  follow-up 
periods), updating sections 4.8 and 5.1 is considered adequate to inform clinicians of the current data 
for lipegfilgrastim in this paediatric study sample. The safety data of single-dose paediatric study XM22-
07 are briefly described in the Lonquex SmPC (Sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). However, on completion of 
the initial assessments of the multi dose study XM22-08, the PI was not updated with these paediatric 
data, awaiting the current variation. An update of the PI has now been provided by the MAH. The MAH 
also  re-analysed  the  differences.  These  findings  were  considered  not  lipegfilgrastim-specific,  as  these 
were also seen in the filgrastim control group. They may be attributable also to known chemotherapy 
side  effects,  as  stated  by  the  MAH.  However,  considering  the  uncertainties  of  the  currently  available 
safety data, the weight of evidence of the SmPC text claim is limited, thus, slight revisions were made 
to  the proposed  PI  texts.  Also,  in this  context, the addition  of  the  cancer treatment  regimens  can  be 
considered as relevant information for the prescriber and is, thus, acceptable. 
Comparison to peer reviewed literature  
In the benefit risk conclusion of the clinical overview it is claimed that results of the two MAH paediatric 
studies, in which 42 children were treated with between 1 and 4 doses of lipegfilgrastim are also reflective 
of  publicly  available  filgrastim  and  pegfilgrastim  studies  in  paediatric  patients.  Only  two  studies  are 
referred to. Data in the report by Wendelin et al. 2005 were collected from a small population of five 
patients  with  a  different  age  range  from  10  years  to  15  years  of  age  (vs.  2  to  17  years)  with  Ewing 
sarcoma alternating pegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatment courses after 59 CTX cycles. The report by 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/642324/2022 
Page 122/146 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Andre et al. 2007 included 28 paediatric patients (age range from 12 to 18 years of age) treated with 
pegfilgrastim.  Considering  the  evident  differences  of  the  compared  study  samples  and  the  limited 
number of patients, it is unclear on exactly what grounds the claims are made.  
A more comprehensive analysis and discussion of the available peer reviewed literature was provided 
and  data  on  between  study  comparisons  with  the historical  filgrastim  studies (the  active  comparator, 
already  approved  for  use  in  paediatric  cancer  patients)  was  also  made  available  to  contextualise  the 
lipegfilgrastim effects.  
Remaining safety uncertainties  
The overall numbers of patients in the two paediatric studies were small, and all the age groups are not 
adequately supported by the provided data. Not only for the youngest age group (6 months to <2 years), 
for which no data are available, but data for the children in the 2 to < 6 years of age is also limited. The 
long-term data are scarce and not available beyond the study end time points (D360). The small number 
in the subgroups (including age, varying CTX treatment) in both studies, do not allow valid conclusions. 
The  design  of  the  two  paediatric  studies  also  differs.  Only  one  of  the  studies  was  comparative  and 
employed multiple doses (one dose administered up to four CTX cycles), i.e. a therapeutic regime more 
comparable to the actual clinical setting, in which it is administered to children. The uncontrolled nature 
of  the  single  dose  lipegfilgrastim  study  also  restricts  interpretation  of  data.  No  comparative  data  on 
immunogenicity is available. Objectivity of pooling the safety data between the two pediatric studies is 
questioned considering the difference in settings (single dose and multiple dose) and the uncontrolled 
nature of the Phase 1 trial. The safety of lipegfilgrastim in this single dose study setting appeared more 
favourable than in the study employing the multi dose regime, which may also question the objectivity 
of pooling data.  
The  possible  effects  of  heterogeneity  of  the  patient  populations,  of  the  treatments  for  the  underlying 
cancer and patient’s response to treatment, in both children and adults, was further discussed by the 
MAH. The question on the adequacy and sufficiency of the data for safety, especially for the youngest 
age group became not applicable, as the MAH withdrew this part of the sought indication. 
The  safety  data  of  single-dose  paediatric  study  XM22-07  are  briefly  described  in  the  Lonquex  SmPC 
(Sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). On completion of the initial assessments of the multi dose study XM22-08, 
the  PI  was  not  updated  with  these  paediatric  data,  awaiting  the  current  variation.  An  update  of  the 
Lonquex PI was provided and deemed acceptable with only some minor PI text revisions.  
As  per  guidance,  safety  information  from  a  source  population  (adult  data)  may  be  used  to  predict 
short-term risks related to the mode of action of the drug and related to dose. However, considering 
that long-term risks related to growth and maturation cannot be extrapolated from adults, thus, to rely 
only on extrapolation for understanding of safety will not usually be possible, certainly for treatments 
intended to be dosed (sub)chronically.  
As  the  extrapolation  exercise  is  considered  an  integral  and  even  critical  part  of  this  lipegfilgrastim 
pediatric  extension  of  indication,  without  which  the  benefit-risk  cannot  be  determined,  a  detailed 
presentation and discussion of the extrapolation framework, including safety, was on requested and duly 
provided; and with clarification, deemed adequate. 
The impact of the PEG molecule    
In  the  initial  submission  of  this  variation  application,  the  MAH  did  not  include  any  discussion  of  the 
potential  concerns  for  use  of  a  PEGylated  medicinal  product  in  paediatric  patients.  Subsequently,  the 
impact of the PEG molecule per se was discussed in detail by the MAH in the response to the 1st RSI. 
The remaining issues in the 2nd RSI related mainly to the youngest age group from 6 months to under 2 
Assessment report

years  of  age.  However,  as  the  MAH  decided  to  withdraw  this  part  of  the  indication,  the  questions 
pertaining to the youngest age group, became no longer applicable.  
The  overall  data  submitted  on  the  impact  of  the  PEG  molecule  can  be  summarised  as  follows:        
Nonclinical data:  Currently,  there  is  still  limited  data  on  the  potential  risks  for  PEG  accumulation  in 
paediatric patients especially in long-term use. PEG has shown to lead to accumulation and vacuolation 
within  specific  cells  of  the  CNS  (choroid  plexus  epithelia),  liver  and  kidney  in  nonclinical  species 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/647258/2012: CHMP Safety Working Party’s response to the PDCO regarding the use 
of  PEGylated  drug  products  in  the  paediatric  population).  However,  no  PEG  accumulation  has  been 
observed in nonclinical studies with lipegfilgrastim. Although a risk to children due to PEG accumulation 
after a long-term treatment has not been thoroughly yet demonstrated, lipegfilgrastim administered in 
conjunction  with  cytotoxic  chemotherapy  is  limited  to  a  duration  of  up  to  1  year  and  the  maximum 
expected  PEG  exposure  would  be  ≤0.010  μmol/kg/month.  MAH  refers  to  the  ≥0.4  µmol/kg/month 
threshold  of  concern  stated  in  the  SWP  response  to  the  PDCO  regarding  the  use  of  PEGylated  drug 
products in the paediatric population (EMA/2012), but since then, PEG-related vacuolations have been 
observed in other species, with smaller PEG moieties (< 40 kDa), and with a lower monthly PEG exposure 
than 0.4 µmol/kg/month. Nevertheless, considering that no vacuolations were observed in the repeated 
dose studies with Lonquex; that it is unlikely that Lonquex would undergo active transport across the 
blood-CSF  barrier  and  that  overall  data  have  indicated  that  PEG-related  vacuolation  has  not  been 
associated with demonstrable cell or tissue dysfunction, it can be concluded that the risk related to the 
PEG in use of Lonquex, is low/negligible for treatment of paediatric patients 2-years of age and older. 
For PK data and data from simulations, please consult PK section. 
Clinical safety data: Considering the currently available data and the overall proposed limited treatment 
period/duration and the monthly PEG exposures, it is agreed with the MAH, that potential risks due to 
PEG accumulation in children treated with Lonquex is likely to be low, but cannot, however, entirely be 
excluded with certainty. The clinical data from children is limited. In total 42 paediatric patients have 
been exposed. This descriptive clinical data did not indicate significant differences in the safety profile of 
lipegfilgrastim in children in comparison to that in adults. The MAH further clarified that even though an 
impact of renal maturation on PEG exposure and PEG accumulation could not be entirely excluded, mainly 
for paucity of data, the available data did not reveal any clear signal indicative of possible lipegfilgrastim-
related changes in renal function in paediatric patients, and, namely, suggestive of possible PEG toxicity. 
In addition to the clinical data, the MAH provided a comprehensive summary of a literature and EPAR 
data  search  for  PEGylated  medicinal  products  and  performed  a  thorough  risk  assessment  of  the  PEG 
accumulation in children treated with lipegfilgrastim.  
Even  though  a  risk  to  children  due  to  PEG  accumulation  after  a  long-term  treatment  has  not  been 
thoroughly yet demonstrated, any possible effects of PEG accumulation would likely be outweighed by 
the known negative effects of cytotoxic chemotherapy.  
Thus, overall, some uncertainty remains. In aim of mitigating any remaining uncertainty and risk, the 
MAH  discussed,  with  due  diligence,  possible  means  that  the  long-term  toxicity  in  children  could  be 
followed up. On the basis of the provided justification, it is agreed that monitoring long-term safety of 
lipegfilgrastim in the paediatric oncology population is challenging. The recruitment of these patients can 
be problematic as numbers are rare. Challenges are also expected in monitoring of paediatric patients 
due to the heterogeneity of this patient population in terms of age, the different developmental stages, 
underlying cancer types, cancer stages, chemotherapy regimens, and adverse effects of chemotherapy, 
including long-term toxicity. The morbidity and mortality in these patients due to underlying disease and 
chemotherapy is high and is likely to account for a majority of adverse events detected. As a result, it is 
agreed  that  it  would  be  difficult  to  ascribe  a  causal  relationship  of  adverse  events  to  lipegfilgrastim 
treatment in the long-term monitoring of a small group of these patients. Therefore, on this background, 
Assessment report

it  is  agreed  with  the  MAH  that  the  long-term  monitoring  of  the  safety  of  lipegfilgrastim  in  paediatric 
oncology patients is not feasible.  
Consequently,  the  long-term  safety  of  lipegfilgrastim  is  proposed  to  be  followed  by  routine 
pharmacovigilance activities and the benefit-risk balance will be continuously monitored and assessed in 
Periodic  Safety  Update  Reports  (PSURs).  According  to  the  MAH,  all  serious  adverse  event  reports 
received  will  undergo  medical  review  and  to  enhance  data  on  possible  risks,  a  more  sensitive  signal 
detection report evaluating any disproportionality of adverse events in the paediatric population will be 
performed, in addition to standard PhV activities (see RMP assessment). This is considered a reasonable, 
adequate and acceptable approach in the current setting.  
Additionally, and importantly, due to the remaining uncertainty regarding the potential safety risks in 
the 6-month to 2 years old age group (for which no clinical data are so far available), as well as the 
availability of alternative treatment options, the MAH proposes to limit the indication for lipegfilgrastim 
to children 2 years of age and older. This is duly acknowledged. 
Additional expert consultations 
None. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of Lonquex (lipegfilgrastim) in the sought paediatric indication seems broadly similar 
to that of the active control, filgrastim, and to the adult safety profile. However, some differences were 
also seen, acknowledging the limitations of the data. Based on these paediatric data and assessment of 
the totality of data, the SmPC has been updated accordingly, also on these differences. From a safety 
point of view, this extension of indication variation, to include treatment of the paediatric population for 
Lonquex, could be considered approvable.   
2.6.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in  the  list  of  Union  reference  dates  (EURD  list)  provided  for  under  Article  107c  (7)  of  Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

2.7.  S&E Extrapolation  
In  the  original  submission,  the  MAH  provided  no  integrated,  structured  description  of  the  pediatric 
extrapolation framework. This was considered necessary also for the 2-17-year-old children, due to the 
limited nature of the data in studies XM22-07 and XM22-08, from which no confirmatory conclusions can 
be drawn. The studies are considered relevant supportive data in favour of extrapolation of efficacy from 
adults to children, however they were not considered sufficient alone to prove efficacy.

As the extrapolation exercise was considered a critical part of this lipegfilgrastim pediatric extension of 
indication, the MAH was requested to provide an extrapolation framework, including a description of the 
plan, 
strategy 
and 
conclusions 
drawn, 
as 
per 
the 
relevant 
guidance 
(https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/documents/scientific-guideline/adopted-reflection-paper-use-
extrapolation-development-medicines-paediatrics-revision-1_en.pdf).    
In their response to the request, the MAH has adopted the extrapolation plan and strategy as suggested 
by the Rapporteur. Namely: 
1. Confirm that lipegfilgrastim is efficacious with a favourable benefit-risk profile in adult subjects. These 
data together with current data from the two paediatric populations with patients aged 2 to 17 years of 
age form the basis of extrapolation to paediatric subjects treated with lipegfilgrastim. 
2. Develop an acceptable PK(/PD) model of lipegfilgrastim which can confirm that the proposed dosing 
will lead to similar response in children and adults. If the marketing authorization holder (MAH) is able 
to argue based on literature that the exposure response profile of adults and children is similar, then it 
is only necessary to confirm that the proposed dosing will lead to similar exposure in children and adults. 
3. Using the available limited data on paediatric patients treated with lipegfilgrastim, provide supportive 
evidence  that  the  efficacy  in  adults  treated  with  lipegfilgrastim  can  overall  be  extrapolated  to  the 
paediatric population (2 to 17 years of age). 
4. Evaluate the safety profile in the paediatric population (aged 2 to 17 years) by comparing it to that of 
the overall clinical development programme in adults and the accrued post marketing experience; and 
confirming that establishing this safety evidence is also sufficient for the most vulnerable of the paediatric 
patients, namely the youngest age group of 2 to 5-year-olds. 
5. Review and summarize the therapeutic index of lipegfilgrastim in adults and discuss how this may 
translate to children. 
6. The justification how transferable the data obtained from the current studies and previous experiences 
collected in other patient populations is to the smallest children from 6 months to 2 years for which no 
clinical study data are so far available. Strong evidence should also be given to justify the use of weight-
based PK scaling to these smallest children. 
7. Identify and plan for the mitigation of any remaining uncertainty and risk. 
Extrapolation results 
Step 1: Confirm that lipegfilgrastim is efficacious with a favourable benefit-risk profile in adult subjects. 
The clinical development programme that led to approval in adults was based on 6 studies: 3 in healthy 
subjects (not described further here) and 3 in patients with cancer receiving CTX. 
Two randomized, active-controlled, double-blind studies (a Phase 2 [XM22-02-INT] and a Phase 3 study 
[XM22-03])  have  demonstrated  that  the  efficacy  of  6  mg  lipegfilgrastim  is  non-inferior  to  that  of 
Neulasta.  The  patient  population  included  in  these  studies,  adult  breast  cancer  patients  receiving 
doxorubicin/docetaxel CTX, is routinely treated prophylactically with G-CSFs and is considered the model 
population for testing G-CSFs in adults. In the Phase 3 adult breast cancer study, the primary endpoint 
was the duration of severe neutropenia (DSN) in cycle 1, which is a commonly used primary endpoint in 
G-CSF studies. The primary endpoint was achieved and non-inferiority of lipegfilgrastim versus Neulasta 
for  DSN  and  febrile  neutropenia  [FN]  in  cycle  1  was  clearly  demonstrated.  There  were  small  non-
significant differences seen between lipegfilgrastim and Neulasta for the secondary endpoints, primarily 
in favour of the lipegfilgrastim arm. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/642324/2022 
Page 126/146 
 
 
 
 
 
In order to test lipegfilgrastim in a placebo-controlled study (as requested by the authorities), an adult 
patient  population  and  CTX  regimen  was  chosen  for  an  additional  Phase  3  study  that  would  have  an 
expected incidence of FN low enough to allow the ethical use of a placebo control (i.e.  non-small cell 
lung cancer patients receiving cisplatin/etoposide). However, these patients would not routinely receive 
prophylactic  G-CSF  treatment.  Despite  this experimental  setting,  lipegfilgrastim  demonstrated  a  clear 
clinical benefit compared to placebo. For the chosen primary endpoint, a clinically relevant reduction of 
more than 50% in the incidence of FN in cycle 1 was observed in the lipegfilgrastim group, but statistical 
significance for superiority to placebo was not reached. Analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints, 
particularly  the  DSN  in  cycle  1,  demonstrated  both  statistically  significant  and  clinically  meaningful 
differences  between  the  lipegfilgrastim  and  placebo groups,  indicating  superiority  of  lipegfilgrastim  to 
placebo. 
The  safety  of  lipegfilgrastim  proved  comparable  to  that  of  Neulasta  in  the  adult  clinical  studies.    The 
adverse reactions observed were typical for G-CSFs and could be easily managed. 
Based on the results of the development programme in adults, lipegfilgrastim was approved for use in 
adults by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2013, for the following indication: 
“Lonquex is indicated in adults for reduction in the duration of neutropenia and the incidence of febrile 
neutropenia  in  patients  treated  with  cytotoxic  chemotherapy  for  malignancy  (with  the  exception  of 
chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes).” 
Study  XM22-ONC-40041,  was  subsequently  performed  in  fulfilment  of  a  condition  of  the  product’s 
marketing  approval.  The  study  further  investigated  the  risks  of  disease  progression  and  mortality 
associated with lipegfilgrastim in patients with malignancy treated with cytotoxic CTX. 
Study XM22-ONC-40041 was completed in 2018 and there was no evidence for increased shortterm or 
overall mortality under lipegfilgrastim treatment than under either placebo or pegfilgrastim treatment. 
“Progression of underlying malignancy” was removed from the potential risks in the risk management 
plan (RMP) based on the results of this study. 
Study  XM22-ONC-50002,  was  a  2-part  (Feasibility  Study  and  Main  Study)  non-interventional  Post-
Authorisation Safety Study. The purpose of the main study was to describe the pattern of lipegfilgrastim 
use, and specifically to quantify the extent of off-label use in routine clinical practice in several countries 
in  the  EU.  Adverse  events/adverse  reactions  were  not  collected  during  this  study.  This  study  showed 
that  the  prevalence  of  off-label  lipegfilgrastim  use  was  1.5%  and  thus  lower  than  the  pre-specified 
expected  background  rate  of  5%  off-label  use.  Off  label  use  of  lipegfilgrastim  was  removed  from  the 
potential risks in the RMP based on the results of this study. 
The safety profile of lipegfilgrastim in adults has been well established after more than 7 years of use in 
the post-marketing setting. Post-marketing safety data are summarized in the Periodic Safety Update 
Reports  (PSURs).  Cumulatively,  the  post-marketing  data  has  maintained  the  benefit-risk  balance  of 
lipegfilgrastim in adults and no additional actions for safety reasons have been warranted based on the 
data collected. 
It is therefore confirmed that lipegfilgrastim is efficacious with a favourable benefit-risk profile in adults. 
Step 2: Develop an acceptable PK(/PD) model of lipegfilgrastim which can confirm that the proposed 
dosing will lead to similar response in children and adults. 
Similarity in lipegfilgrastim exposure-response between adults and children is supported by: 
•  All  pharmacological  actions  of  human  recombinant  G-CSF  are  mediated  via  a  single  receptor 
(G-CSFR), therefore, comparable receptor binding is expected to result in comparable effects. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/642324/2022 
Page 127/146 
 
 
 
 
•  Other recombinant human G-CSF, such as filgrastim and pegfilgrastim, have been successfully 
used  to  treat  CTX-induced  neutropenia  through  restoration  of  the  number  of  neutrophils  and 
alleviation of the severity of neutropenia and/or febrile neutropenia (Holmes et al 2002). Clinical 
studies have shown pegfilgrastim and filgrastim to be safe and efficacious in paediatric patients 
(including new-borns) and the existing data do not indicate any differences between the adult 
and  paediatric  populations  regarding  either the  pharmacological properties  and  mechanism of 
action of these products or their pharmacokinetics (André et al 2007; Borinstein et al 2009; Fox 
et al 2009; Spunt et al 2010). 
• 
Therefore, extrapolating  from  other  recombinant  human  G-CSF  molecules  with  proven  similar 
mechanism  of  action,  there  are  no  indications  that  the  pharmacological  properties  and 
mechanism of action of lipegfilgrastim will differ between the adult and paediatric populations. 
Lipegfilgrastim is expected to have a similar safety and efficacy profile to that of pegfilgrastim in 
children. 
In order to support the extrapolation of the efficacy in children based on the similarity of the exposure, 
a mechanistic population PK-PD was developed from adult and paediatric data. The present analysis was 
designed to further investigate the pharmacology and clinical effects of lipegfilgrastim in children aged 
2 
to 
<18 years 
who 
received 
doseintensive, 
cytotoxic 
CTX 
(including 
vincristine/ifosfamide/doxorubicin/etoposide 
[VIDE], 
vincristine/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide 
alternating  with  ifosfamide/etoposide  [VDC/IE],  vincristine/actinomycin  D/cyclophosphamide  [VAC], 
ifosfamide/vincristine/actinomycin  D  [IVA],  or  ifosfamide/  vincristine/actinomycin  D/doxorubicin 
[IVADo]  each  with  concomitant  sodium  2-mercaptoethane  sulfonate  according  to  local  standards)  for 
Ewing family of tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma. The primary goal of these analyses was to provide a 
more  mechanistic  understanding  of  the  dose-exposure-response  relationship  between  lipegfilgrastim 
dose,  XM22  concentrations,  and  ANC  in  paediatric  cancer  patients  aged  2  to  <18  years  and  further 
extrapolate to <2 years of age. 
The mechanistic population PK-PD models allows the assessment of the: 
• 
• 
• 
similarity/difference  in  reduction  in  neutropenia  in  response  to  lipegfilgrastim  in  paediatric 
subsets by age, weight, or other characteristics; 
similarity between paediatric and adult PK and ANC response;  
appropriateness of planned dosing regimens in children using model-based simulations. 
This  model,  together  with  weight  scaling,  also  serves  as  an  effective  tool  in  performing  various 
deterministic and stochastic simulations to extrapolate the anticipated exposures and ANC responses in 
children 6 months to 2 years in support of the selection of dosing strategies in this population of infants 
and very young children. 
Population Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Modeling and Simulation Methodology: The details of the 
mechanistic model development process are described in details in report PMX-21- 01. In summary, the 
overall procedures followed for the development of the lipegfilgrastim population PK-PD model were: 
1.  exploratory data analysis; 
2.  base  structural  model  development  using  pooled  data  from  healthy  adults  enrolled  in 
2 Phase 1 studies  (XM22-01-CH  and  XM22-05-CH),  adult  patients  with  cancer  enrolled  in 
1 Phase 2 study (XM22-02-INT) and 2 Phase 3 studies (XM22-03 and XM22-04), and paediatric 
patients with cancer enrolled in 1 Phase 1 study (XM22-07) and 1 Phase 2 study (XM22-08); 
3.  evaluation of covariate effects using forward selection and, if necessary, backward elimination 
procedures;

final model refinement; and 
5.  model evaluation. 
Results and conclusions: A semi-mechanistic PK-PD model that was initially developed using data from 
adult cancer patients to describe XM22 PK and ANC response following lipegfilgrastim administration was 
successfully extended to data collected in paediatric oncology patients aged 2 to <18 years who received 
lipegfilgrastim  along  with  dose-intensive,  cytotoxic  CTX  therapy.  The  structural  framework  and 
parameters  comprising  the  adult  PK-PD  model  were  largely  applicable  to  the  paediatric  population, 
requiring only minor refinements, supporting the robustness of the PK-PD model for characterizing the 
disposition of XM22 and its effects on ANC across a heterogeneous population of cancer patients with a 
wide range of ages. 
A one compartment model with a first order, delayed absorption process, and a combination of linear 
and  non-linear  clearance  (dependent on the  ANC)  adequately  described  the  XM22  concentration-time 
course following a single subcutaneous injection. Body weight was a statistically significant predictor of 
the  PK parameters  characterizing  the  linear  clearance  (CLlin/F)  and  non-linear  clearance  (Kcat/F)  of 
XM22, as well as Vc/F, with each parameter increasing with body weight according to power functions. 
Age was not found to be a significant predictor of the clearance of the XM22. 
The PD portion of the model predicted ANC by describing neutrophil dynamics (proliferation, maturation, 
and elimination) via a sequential series of 5 connected compartments, in which transfer between each 
compartment was characterized by mean transit time; XM22 influenced ANC dynamics by stimulating 
proliferation and maturation via 2 concentration-dependent functions. 
The  developed  PK-PD  model  was  able  to  adequately  and  simultaneously  predict  XM22  concentrations 
and  corresponding  ANC  response  profiles  throughout  the  duration  of  cycle  1,  including  accurate 
characterization of the pre-nadir ANC peak levels, ANC nadir values and duration, and the recovery in 
ANC near the end of cycle 1. 
Stochastic simulations successfully leveraged the final PK-PD model to extrapolate XM22 exposures and 
ANC response following concomitant CTX and lipegfilgrastim treatment in a young population aged birth 
to 2 years. Model-based extrapolations of key clinical endpoints (incidence of severe neutropenia, DSN, 
and  ANC  nadir)  in  virtual  patients  ≥6  months  to  2  years  of  age  were  reasonable  and  similar  to  the 
observed  clinical  parameters  in  adult  and  paediatric  studies.  In  addition,  a  comparison  of  exposure 
(Cmax and AUC) at proposed doses for four weight bands (6 kg and above) showed similar exposure 
following  both  100 μg/kg  and  flat  dose  by  weight  band  which  further  support  an  exposure-matching 
extrapolation approach. 
Step  3:  Using  the  available  limited  data  on  paediatric  patients  treated  with  lipegfilgrastim,  provide 
supportive evidence that the efficacy in adults treated with lipegfilgrastim can overall be extrapolated to 
the paediatric population (2 to 17 years of age). 
Lipegfilgrastim efficacy data are presented for both adults and the paediatric population in the Summary 
of Clinical Efficacy (Module 2.7.3). 
The ontogeny of neutrophil production and function indicates that term infants achieve adult neutrophil 
counts and biologic activity by 4 weeks of post-natal age or earlier (Lawrence et al 2018); this suggests 
that  neutrophil  dynamics  and  homeostasis  are  similar  between  adults  and  children  supporting 
extrapolation of adult efficacy data to the paediatric population. 
As noted by the Rapporteur, the mechanisms of action of filgrastim, pegfilgrastim, and lipegfilgrastim 
are  identical  (even  if  their  potency  may  not  be)  so  the  data  from  earlier  filgrastim  and  pegfilgrastim

studies can be used to inform how the exposure-response relationship of a GCSF therapy translates from 
adults to children. 
In the adult lipegfilgrastim studies, non-inferiority of XM22 to Neulasta (pegfilgrastim) was demonstrated 
in the active-controlled adult breast cancer studies XM22-03 (confirmatory, Phase 3) and XM22-02-INT 
(dose finding, Phase 2). Neulasta was considered the appropriate active control for studies in adults as 
it is approved in this population and, similar to lipegfilgrastim, is a long-acting G-CSF. The DSN in Cycle 
1  was  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  in  these  studies,  which  is  a  commonly  used  primary  endpoint  in 
studies  with  G-CSFs.  This  was  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  in  the  Neulasta  studies  included  in  the 
successful Neulasta marketing authorization application (EMA) and Biologic License Application (FDA). 
Analysis  of  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  further  supported  the  non-inferiority  of  XM22  to  Neulasta  in 
adults. These consistent and robust results provided sufficient confidence that XM22 is clinically at least 
not less efficacious than Neulasta. 
For paediatric study XM22-08, Neulasta could not be used as the active control as it is not approved for 
use in children in the EU. Filgrastim, a short-acting G-CSF approved for use in children was therefore 
chosen as the active comparator, and was agreed with the Paediatric Committee (PDCO). In Study XM22-
08 there was no meaningful difference between the lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatment groups in 
the DSN in Cycle 1.The results of the secondary endpoints were supportive of the results of the primary 
endpoint  –  there  were  no  meaningful  differences  between  the  2  treatment  groups  with  respect  to 
incidence of severe neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, hospitalization due to febrile neutropenia, DSN in 
Cycle 2 to 4, very severe neutropenia, mean AUCANC values in Cycle 1, mean ANC nadir values in cycles 
1 to 4, mean time to ANC nadir in cycles 1 to 4 from start of CTX or IMP administration, and mean times 
to ANC recovery threshold of ANC >1.0 × 109/L and ANC >2.0 × 109/L in cycles 1 to 4. 
Data for lipegfilgrastim therefore indicate comparable efficacy with the short-acting G-CSF filgrastim in 
the paediatric population (2 to 17 years of age). Furthermore, there are data in the literature indicating 
that Neulasta and filgrastim have comparable efficacy in paediatric patients; these were included in the 
Paediatric Investigation Plan and informed the design of the lipegfilgrastim studies: 
• 
In a randomised trial and PK study of pegfilgrastim versus filgrastim after dose-intensive CTX in 
young adults and children with sarcomas (Fox et al 2009), 34 patients (median age 20 years, 
range 3.8–25.8) were enrolled, and 32 completed cycles 1 to 4. The median (range) duration of 
ANC of <500/μL was 5.5 (3–8) days for pegfilgrastim and 6 (0–9) days for filgrastim (p=0.76) 
after VDC, and 1.5 (0–4) days for pegfilgrastim and 3.75 (0–6.5) days for filgrastim (p=0.11) 
after ifosfamide. More episodes of febrile neutropenia and documented infections occurred in the 
filgrastim  arm  than  in  the  pegfilgrastim  arm.  Serum  pegfilgrastim  concentrations  were  highly 
variable. Pegfilgrastim apparent clearance (11 mL/h/kg) was similar to that reported in adults. 
The authors concluded that a single dose per cycle of pegfilgrastim was well tolerated and may 
be as effective as daily filgrastim based on the DSN and number of episodes of febrile neutropenia 
and documented infections after dose-intensive treatment with VDC and IE. 
• 
In  a  Phase  2,  randomised,  open-label  study  (Spunt  et  al  2010),  44  patients  with  previously 
untreated,  biopsy-proven  sarcoma,  stratified  into  3  age  groups  (0–5  years  [13  patients], 
6-11 years [12 patients], and 12–21 years [19 patients]), were randomly assigned in a 6:1 ratio 
to receive a single SC pegfilgrastim dose of 100 μg/kg (n=38) or daily sc filgrastim doses of 5 
μg/kg (n=6) after CTX (cycles 1 and 3: vincristine/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide [VDC]; cycles 
2 and 4: ifosfamide/etoposide [IE]). Neulasta and filgrastim were reported to be similar for all 
efficacy and safety endpoints, and their pharmacokinetic profiles were consistent with those in 
adults.  Younger  children  experienced  more  protracted  neutropenia  and  had  higher  median 
pegfilgrastim exposure than older children.

Considering that three independent studies (XM22-08, Fox et al 2009, Spunt et al 2010) have found that 
2 different long-acting G-CSFs have comparable efficacy to filgrastim in the paediatric population, and 
considering  that  filgrastim  is  approved  in  both  adults  and  the  paediatric  population,  there  is  good 
supporting evidence that adult data for lipegfilgrastim can be extrapolated to the paediatric population 
(2 to 17 years of age). 
Teva conducted two clinical studies for XM22 in paediatric subjects (2 to 17 years old). Weight scaled 
doses (100 μg/kg) were used in both studies. The data show that XM22 reached comparable exposure 
in paediatric patients as in adults, and that lipegfilgrastim is effective in patients >2 years of age with 
an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. 
A population PK-PD analysis was conducted by combining adult and paediatric data. The population PK-
PD  analysis  showed  that  the  key  PK  and  PD  parameters  were  comparable  across  the  weight  bands 
included  in  these  studies.  This  provides  evidence  that  based  on  the  PK  of  XM22,  response  can  be 
extrapolated in the paediatric subjects. 
Step 4: Evaluate the safety profile in the paediatric population (aged 2 to 17 years). 
Overall, the treatment-emergent adverse event profile was generally comparable between adults and 
paediatric  patients  aged  2  to  17  years.  Some  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders  (anaemia, 
lymphopenia,  thrombocytopenia)  and  gastrointestinal  disorders  (vomiting)  were  observed  in  higher 
frequency in paediatric patients than those in adult clinical trials, which was considered to be related to 
more aggressive CTX regimens used in the paediatric studies. 
Step  5:  The  justification  how  transferable  the  data  obtained  from  the  current  studies  and  previous 
experiences collected in other patient populations is to the smallest children from 6 months to 2 years 
for which no clinical study data are so far available. Strong evidence should also be given to justify the 
use of weight-based PK scaling to these smallest children. 
For many drugs, extrapolation of efficacy based on PK provides unique challenges below the age of 2 
years. Paediatric patients below 2 years of age, especially neonates, undergo rapid changes in their main 
elimination organs (kidney and liver function) during maturation. In the case of XM22, exposure can be 
extrapolated  based  on  a  single  allometric  exponent  based  on  body  weight  to  the  paediatric  subjects 
because XM22 has 2 distinct clearance pathways which are not related to renal or hepatic maturation. 
In addition, the ontogeny of neutrophil production and function indicates that term infants achieve adult 
neutrophil counts and biologic activity by 4 weeks of post-natal age or earlier, which further suggests 
that the neutrophil dynamics and homeostasis are similar between adults and children down to 4 weeks 
of age. 
The first clearance pathway is linear and is likely comprised of degradation by proteolytic enzymes as 
previously  described.  The  second  pathway  is  non-linear  neutrophil-mediated  clearance  (intracellular) 
that is dependent on ANC. After administration of XM22, the non-linear clearance in any given subject 
varies over time together with the ANC values and the drug concentration values. In general, low ANC 
values  are  associated  with  a  high  linear  clearance  percentage.  Thus,  at  lower  ANC  values  the  linear 
clearance is  the  predominant  pathway  and  at  high ANC  values  non-linear  clearance  predominates.  In 
addition,  in  a  study  with  30  subjects  categorized  into  5  renal  function  groups  (Yang  et  al  2008),  no 
apparent  relationship  was  observed  between  the  degree  of  renal  function  and  the  PK  or  PD  of 
pegfilgrastim. The authors concluded that no dosage adjustment for renal impairment is indicated for 
pegfilgrastim. 
Since  elimination 
is  primarily  by  non-renal  mechanism  and 
is  a 
function  of  proteolytic 
degradation/neutrophil counts, the weight-based extrapolation (using single exponents) of doses below 
2 years of age is appropriate. Importantly, the ontogeny of neutrophil production and function supports

Page 131/146 
 
 
 
 
that term infants will achieve adult neutrophil concentrations and biologic activity by 4 weeks post-natal 
age or earlier (Lawrence et al 2018). As neutrophil-mediated clearance is the principal contributor for 
non-linear  elimination  of  lipegfilgrastim,  the  updated  model  incorporating  ANC  and  PK  is  appropriate 
across the proposed paediatric and adult age and body-size range. Neutrophil degranulation capabilities 
mediated by neutrophil elastase in term neonates are also similar to adults. As neutrophil elastase is an 
enzyme  involved  in  linear  clearance  of  lipegfilgrastim,  paediatric  patients  across  the  proposed 
lipegfilgrastim age range (>6 months age) are expected to have similar neutrophil-elastase-mediated 
linear clearance as adults. 
Further supportive evidence of the efficacy and safety of G-CSFs in cancer patients aged 6 months to 
2 years is available for other products: 
Thirteen cancer patients in the 0–5 years age group were included in the Phase 2 pegfilgrastim-filgrastim 
study reported by Spunt et al 2010, with four patients between the ages of 28 days and 23 months. All 
four of these patients were included in the pegfilgrastim treatment group.  Although results were not 
presented separately for the <2 years patients, the authors concluded that a single dose of pegfilgrastim 
at 100 μg/kg administered once per CTX cycle is comparable to daily injections of filgrastim at 5 μg/kg 
for paediatric sarcoma patients receiving myelosuppressive CTX. The results of this study are cited in 
the  Neulasta  United  States  prescribing information (Neulasta  USPI) to  support  the  use of  Neulasta  in 
paediatric patients with no lower age cut-off. 
One  patient  aged  1.4  years  and  one  aged  1.9  years  were  included  the  Teva  tbo-filgrastim  Phase  2, 
international, multicenter, open-label clinical trial of subcutaneous tbo-filgrastim in paediatric patients 
with solid tumors undergoing myelosuppressive CTX (Federman et al 2019). There was no indication of 
safety or efficacy issues in these 2 patients. 
Step 6: Identify and plan for the mitigation of any remaining uncertainty and risk. 
Teva has not identified any remaining uncertainty or risks that would require further measures in addition 
to  the  routine  pharmacovigilance  activities  implemented  to  regularly  monitor  the  safety  profile  of 
lipegfilgrastim and update of the core safety information accordingly, where needed. 
MAH Conclusions 
The  integrated  extrapolation  strategy  and  results  summarized  in  this  response  establish  a  line  of 
reasoning about the relationship between dose, exposure and PD effects and clinical by: 
•  Confirming efficacy and a favourable benefit-risk profile of lipegfilgastrim in adults 
• 
Providing  a  rationale  supporting  the  similarity  in  disease  and  exposure-response  relationship 
between adults and paediatric populations 
•  Developing an acceptable PK(/PD) model of lipegfilgrastim which can confirm that the proposed 
dosing will lead to similar responses in children and adults 
• 
• 
• 
Providing  supporting  evidence  that  the  efficacy  in  adults  can  be  extrapolated  to  paediatric 
patients 2 to 17 years of age 
Evaluating the safety profile in the paediatric population 
Providing justification of extrapolation from adults and children 2 to 17 years of age to younger 
children from 6 months to 2 years old via weight-based dosing and extrapolation principles from 
other approved human recombinant G-CSF the line of reasoning in the extrapolation strategy 
and plan presented here is in line with the recommendation from the final “Reflection paper on 
the  use  of  extrapolation  in  the  development  of  medicines  for  paediatrics”  [EMA  2018].  No 
additional sources of uncertainty or risk have been identified.

2.7.1.  Discussion on Extrapolation 
The MAH was originally seeking indication also for children aged 6 months to 2 years of age, even though 
the clinical pharmacology of lipegfilgrastim has not been studied in these children. It is also relevant to 
note that the plans to extrapolate the indication down to 6 months of age was included in the PIP, and 
the plan was approved by the PDCO. A MO was raised on the extrapolation, and as of 2nd RSI response, 
the MAH proposed to limit the indication to children 2 years of age and older.  
A step-by-step assessment of the extrapolation framework, as proposed by the MAH, is provided below. 
Confirm that lipegfilgrastim is efficacious with a favourable benefit-risk profile in adult subjects. 
Efficacy and positive benefit risk of lipegfilgrastim in adults is supported by 6 clinical studies in adults. 
Results  of  two  randomized  controlled  studies  demonstrate  non-inferiority  of  lipegfilgrastim  versus 
Neulasta for DSN and febrile neutropenia [FN] in cycle 1. There were small non-significant differences 
seen  between  lipegfilgrastim  and  Neulasta  for  the  secondary  endpoints,  primarily  in  favor  of  the 
lipegfilgrastim arm.  
In general results of the PD and clinical efficacy endpoints (i.e. incidence of severe and duration of severe 
neutropenia,  time  to  ANC  recovery,  incidence  of  FN,  time  in  days  in  hospital  due  to  FN  or  connected 
infections and incidence of treatment with iv. antibiotics due to FN) were consistent and show comparable 
efficacy for lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim in adult patients. 
Develop an acceptable PK(/PD) model of lipegfilgrastim which can confirm that the proposed dosing will 
lead to similar response in children and adults. 
As of the 1st RSI response, the PK-PD model has been completely rebuilt using a combined and extensive 
PK-PD dataset of lipegfilgrastim in adults and children. The PK-PD model is acceptable for supporting 
efficacy extrapolation from adults to children.  
With  regard  to  the  relationship  between  PD  and  clinical  outcome,  it  is  agreed  with  the  MAH  that  the 
pharmacological action of human recombinant G-CSF are mediated via a single receptor and therefore 
it is expected that comparable receptor binding results in comparable effects. Given the similar mode of 
action of G-CSF products, it can be assumed that PD-clinical outcome relation is the same for different 
products and that when comparable efficacy for adults and children is made plausible for one or two G-
CSF products, this is will be also the case for other G-CSF products.  
In adult studies with filgrastim, pegfilgrastim and lipegfilgrastim products, PD results (endpoints related 
to ANC) were in line with results of more clinical endpoints like incidence of FN, use of antibiotics and 
time of hospitalization. Pediatric studies with filgrastim, pegfilgrastim and lipegfilgrastim also don’t show 
any discrepancy in PD and clinical outcome. Given the above, it can be agreed that for lipegfilgrastim PD 
results is predictive for clinical results in adults as well as in children.   
Similar efficacy of G-CSF products (filgrastim and pegfilgrastim) for adults and children are previously 
suggested. Filgrastim is approved for both children and adults by which it was acknowledged that safety 
and  efficacy  of  filgrastim  for  adults  and  children  who  have  received  cytotoxic  chemotherapy  is 
comparable.  
Two published studies indicate comparable efficacy and safety of pegfilgrastim and filgrastim in children. 
These results were in line with the results of a meta-analysis including randomized adult trials comparing 
efficacy of peg-filgrastim and filgrastim, showing similar efficacy between pegfilgrastim and filgrastim. 
None of the referred clinical studies comparing pegfilgrastim and filgrastim include sufficient numbers of 
children and adults, who were treated with the same chemotherapy. Efficacy in adults and children was 
never directly compared within the same study, and similar efficacy was only suggested based on indirect 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/642324/2022 
Page 133/146 
 
 
 
 
comparison  between  clinical  study.  Therefore,  no  definitive  conclusion  can  be  drawn  with  regard  to 
similarity of efficacy of G-CSF treatment in children. Nevertheless, both pediatric and adult clinical studies 
come to the same conclusion i.e. efficacy of pegfilgrastim is comparable to filgrastim.  
The presented clinical study results and information do not suggest against extrapolating the efficacy 
and safety results of G-CSF from adults to children from a clinical perspective. 
Using the available limited data on paediatric patients treated with lipegfilgrastim, provide supportive 
evidence  that  the  efficacy  in  adults  treated  with  lipegfilgrastim  can  overall  be  extrapolated  to  the 
paediatric population (2 to 17 years of age) 
The MAH has summarised the available paediatric lipegfilgrastim PK-PD data in children.  
Additionally, the MAH refers to two published studies of filgrastim and pegfilgrastim, which found that 
pegfilgrastim  had  comparable  efficacy  to  filgrastim  in  the  paediatric  population.  Together  with  study 
XM22-08,  which  provides  support  that  the  duration  of  severe  neutropenia  was  similar  between 
lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim treatments, the MAH argues that as “2 different long-acting G-CSFs have 
comparable efficacy to filgrastim in the paediatric population, and considering that filgrastim is approved 
in  both  adults  and  the  paediatric  population,  there  is  good  supporting  evidence  that  adult  data  for 
lipegfilgrastim can be extrapolated to the paediatric population”. Again, this argument is acknowledged, 
but at the same time it needs to be noted that the data thus far have not been compelling enough to 
grant the paediatric indication to pegfilgrastim.  
The  published  studies  do  not  distinguish  different  age  groups.  The  MAH  seems  to  suggest  that  no 
differences are expected for filgrastim products from children 4 weeks of postnatal age onwards, as at 
that age neutrophil count is comparable to adults. Indeed, Lawrence et al (2018) reports that at about 
4 weeks of age, neutrophil values reach adult values. Whether the activity of neutrophils from that age 
onwards is also similar to adults, is not clear from this publication. 
Evaluate the safety profile in the paediatric population (aged 2 to 17 years) by comparing it to that of 
the overall clinical development programme in adults and the accrued post marketing experience; and 
confirming that establishing this safety evidence is also sufficient for the most vulnerable of the paediatric 
patients, namely the youngest age group of 2 to 5-year-olds. 
Considering  the  slightly  different  safety  profile  of  lipegfilgrastim  in  paediatric  patients  compared  to 
adults, the MAH has reanalysed and discussed, as requested, these differences in the available safety 
data in more detail.  
The currently available peer reviewed literature is fragmented, the safety data is not always provided 
and, thus, inconsistencies in the rates of ADRs and overall TEAEs are seen in the safety data reported in 
the  literature.  Comparisons  were  also  made  between  the  safety  data  currently  available  from  adult 
(XM22-02,  XM22-03,  XM22-04)  and  paediatric  clinical  studies  (XM22-07  and  XM22-08).  Direct 
comparisons  are,  however,  hampered  not  only  by  the  age  difference,  but  also  due  to  the  underlying 
malignancies,  heterogenicity  of  the  administered  chemotherapies  (the  difference  in  back  bone 
chemotherapy by which the chemotherapy regime used in the pediatric population is more cytotoxic and 
myelotoxic than the chemotherapy used in adults), the different study durations, and study designs and 
overall small numbers of patients. This would explain higher incidences of anaemia, lymphopenia and 
vomiting, but also the higher rate of febrile neutropenia. These higher rates of AEs are not specific for 
children  treated  with  lipegfilgrastim,  but  are  also  reported  for  filgrastim  and  pegfilgrastim,  may  be 
attributable  to  the  disease  itself  under  study  and  can,  indeed,  even  be  considered  related  to 
chemotherapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/642324/2022 
Page 134/146 
 
 
 
 
Thus, uncertainties will remain concerning the current data. Given this, the MAH considers that the most 
informative comparison evaluating lipegfilgrastim ADRs is that with the filgrastim control group in study 
XM22-08. 
Overall, acknowledging the limitations of the available data, it can be agreed that adverse effects related 
to  pegfilgrastim  or  filgrastim  or  the  overall  TEAEs  observed  in  paediatric  cancer  patients  receiving 
chemotherapy treated with filgrastim or pegfilgrastim appear generally consistent with those observed 
with lipegfilgrastim. These data showed higher rates of anaemia, lymphopenia, and vomiting in paediatric 
patients, but these findings were considered not lipegfilgrastim-specific, as these were also seen in the 
filgrastim control group. They may be attributable also to known chemotherapy side effects, as stated 
by the MAH.  
Identify and plan for the mitigation of any remaining uncertainty and risk. 
No remaining risks were identified by the MAH. However, long-term safety of lipegfilgrastim including 
the  impact  of  the  PEG  molecule  in  lipegfilgrastim  on  children  is  still  unknown.  Long-term  toxicity  in 
children should be followed up and routine PhV activities were deemed adequate for this.  
2.7.2.  Conclusion on Extrapolation 
The currently presented extrapolation framework is sufficient to support a positive benefit/risk balance 
in children ≥2 years of age, as all remaining issues have been satisfactorily answered by the MAH. The 
extrapolation of PK-PD to children aged 6 months to 2 years was considered controversial. However, the 
MAH decided to withdraw this part of the indication and the question thus was considered adequately 
resolved.   
2.8.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version (v12.0) and subsequently v.14.1 with this application. The 
(main) proposed RMP changes were the following: 
Finalisation of study XM22-08; 
Finalisation of study XM22-ONC-40041; 
• 
• 
•  Revision of the list of safety concerns; 
•  Removal of black triangle; 
•  Amendment of DUS timelines; 
•  Change of Marketing Authorisation Holder; 
•  Update in line with revision 2 of GVP module V (RMP template Rev. 2.0.1) 
While  this  procedure  has  been  ongoing  the  MAH  submitted  an  RMP  variation  (version  13.0,  variation 
approved  11  Mar  2021),  in  which  many  of  the  changes  requested  by  this  procedure  have  been 
implemented. 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 14.1 is acceptable.  
Safety specifications 
The  changes  in  the  safety  specification  included  revisions  to  product  overview,  epidemiology  of  the 
indications  and  the  target  population  and  additional  EU  requirements  for  the  safety  specification  to 
present data according to the new Guidance on the format of the risk management plan (RMP) in the EU 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/642324/2022

(revision 2.01). Clinical trial and post authorisation exposure data were updated. Part II - Module SIV 
Populations not studied in clinical trials was updated as per finalised paediatric investigation program. 
The non-clinical part of the safety specification was updated to include information on cases of cellular 
vacuolation  that  have  been  observed  in  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  conducted  with  other  PEGylated 
therapeutic proteins in the non-clinical part of the safety specification. 
The list of safety concerns was updated and the section was revised to present data according to the 
new Guidance on the format of the risk management plan (RMP) in the EU (revision 2.01).  
The MAH proposes to remove the following safety concerns from the RMP: 
In RMP Version 12.0 the 
Reasons for the removal from the list of safety concerns 
following safety concerns 
were removed from the 
list of safety concerns: 
Progression of underlying 
malignancy (Important 
potential risk) 
The  results  of  study  XM22-ONC-40041  have  shown  that  patients  with  NSCLC 
treated with lipegfilgrastim did not experience a higher incidence or risk over time 
of death or disease progression as compared to placebo-treated patients. There 
was no evidence for increased short-term or overall mortality under lipegfilgrastim 
treatment than under pegfilgrastim treatment. 
No  additional  pharmacovigilance  activities  or  additional  risk  minimisation 
measures are instituted for this safety concern. 
In light of the updates in the Guidance on the Good Pharmacovigilance Practice 
(GVP) Module V – Risk management systems Revision 2 and the new definitions 
of the important identified/potential risks (risks affecting the benefit-risk balance 
of  the  product  that  would  usually  warrant  a  further  evaluation  as  part  of  the 
pharmacovigilance  plan  or  additional  risk  minimisation  measures)  and  a  new 
definition of missing information (not just absence of data, but gaps in information 
that  warrant  further  investigation  to  refine  understanding  of  the  benefit-risk 
balance), this safety concern can be removed from the RMP. 
Risks in children < 18 years 
of age (Missing information) 
Teva  is  submitting  an  extension  application  to  add  paediatric  patients  to  the 
indication. 
No  additional  pharmacovigilance  activities  or  additional  risk  minimisation 
measures are instituted for this safety concern. 
In light of the updates in the Guidance on the Good Pharmacovigilance Practice 
(GVP) Module V – Risk management systems Revision 2 and the new definitions 
of the important identified/potential risks (risks affecting the benefit-risk balance

definition of missing information (not just absence of data, but gaps in information 
that  warrant  further  investigation  to  refine  understanding  of  the  benefit-risk 
balance), this safety concern can be removed from the RMP.

Pharmacovigilance plan 
This  section  was  revised  to  present  data  according  to  the  new  Guidance  on  the  format  of  the  risk 
management plan (RMP) in the EU (revision 2.01). 
The  additional  pharmacovigilance  activity  “Study  XM22-08”  was  removed  since  study  was  finalised 
(v.12.0 of the RMP). 
The  additional  pharmacovigilance  activity  “Prospective  active-controlled  PASS  evaluating  the  risk  of 
disease progression” was removed since study was finalised (v.12.0 of the RMP). 
A DUS study - Prescribing Patterns of lipegfilgrastim (Lonquex) in the European Union – was removed 
as study was finalised (v. 13.0 of the RMP) 
There are no remaining additional pharmacovigilance actions in the RMP. 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities are considered sufficient to monitor the benefit-risk profile of the 
product and to detect any safety concerns. 
Risk minimisation measures 
Only  routine  risk  minimisation  measures  are  in  place.  The  proposed  risk  minimisation  measures  are 
sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication(s). 
2.9.  Update of the Product information 
As a result of this group of variations, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 of the SmPC have been updated 
for Lonquex 6 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe. The Package Leaflet (PL) has been updated 
accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current QRD template version 10.2. 
In  addition,  the  Marketing  authorisation  holder  (MAH)  took  the opportunity  to  update  the  list  of  local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet.  
Please refer to Product Information, which includes all agreed changes. 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The MAH has justified the omission of full user testing for Lonquex 6 mg/0.6 ml solution for injection PL 
by referring to a user consultation of Lonquex 6 mg solution for injection in pre-filled syringe regarding 
content,  design,  layout  and  format.  Differences  between  the  parent  and  daughter  PLs  are  minor  and 
have been adequately addressed by the MAH. The proposed bridging for Lonquex 6mg/0.6 ml solution 
for injection PL is approvable. 
2.9.2.  Human factor studies 
Human factor studies  
The  HF  validation  study  was  conducted  under  simulated  use  conditions  to  evaluate  whether  the  final 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/642324/2022 
Page 137/146 
 
 
 
 
 
 
finished combination product user interface will maximise the likelihood that the combination product 
will  be  safely  and  effectively  used  by  the  intended  users,  for  the  intended  uses,  in  the  intended  use 
environment. 
The HF validation study included only adult patients/lay caregivers (n=15) and healthcare professionals 
(n=18). No pediatric users took part in the study. As the pre-filled syringe is suitable for use in children 
weighing more than 45 Kg, Rapporteur considers that it is possible for adolescents to administer Lonquex 
by themselves. Therefore, The MAH was requested to provide data on whether the pre-filled syringe can 
be safely and effectively used also by adolescents. 
The  MAH  responded  by  comparing the  break  loose  and  glide  force  specification  for  the  Lonquex  drug 
device combination product supports use by adolescent users: 
Additionally,  to  assess  adolescent  use,  the  MAH  is  in  the  process  of  preparing  an  additional  Human 
Factors Summative Study of the Lonquex drug device combination product by adolescents (ages 12 to 
<18)  who  may  want  to  self-administer  the  Lonquex  product  and  who  are  above  the  higher  weight 
threshold. 
The study design will be based on guidance provided by the International Electrotechnical Commission 
(IEC) 62366-1 Medical devices – Part 1: Application of usability engineering to medical devices Section 
5.5 (IEC 2020) and will include a minimum of 15 participants who will be recruited for the study, including 
both experienced and naïve self-injecting adolescent users. 
One  recruitment  criterion  for  Non-HCP  Adults  was  that  participant  had  experience  of  injection 
(administers medication subcutaneously to themselves or someone else using a pre-filled syringe within 
the last 3 months and at least once a week). However, Rapporteur considers it possible that patient or 
lay caregivers will be using the pre-filled syringe also for the first time when Lonquex is given. The MAH 
was requested to clarify the reasons why pre-filled syringe-naïve patients were not included in the HF 
study and discuss how the lack of injection experience affects the effective and safe administration of 
Lonquex. 
The MAH responded that both the Lonquex PL and SmPC provide clear instructions which state that users 
who  wish  to  self-administer  Lonquex  should  receive  appropriate  training  by  their  HCP  prior  first  self-
administration; correct adherence to the PL and SmPC would ensure that a user’s first injection would 
be done under direct supervision. Because of the instructions provided in the PL and SmPC, the MAH did 
not include naïve users in the Adult HF Summative Study. 
Analysis in Adult HF Summative Study contained the Safety Risk Management Report and considered 
the  highest  probability  of  occurrence  for  each  hazard  in  relation  to  each  of  these  user  groups.  No 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/642324/2022 
Page 138/146 
 
 
 
 
 
 
additional risks for naïve versus experienced users were identified. 
Finally,  it  was  the  MAH's  intention,  as  part  of  the  Adolescent  HF  Summative  Study,  to  include  both 
experienced  and  naïve  adolescents  in  order  to  generate  real  life  data.  This  study  was  provided  and 
although  not  conclusive  not  pursued  further.  The  SmPC  clearly  indicates  that  the  patients  should  be 
adequately trained and have access to expert advice, the first injection should be performed under direct 
medical supervision, and thus the role of health care personnel to evaluate the ability and the motivation 
of the patients for the self-administration is of importance. This is considered sufficient. In the current 
HF study this guidance by health personnel was not provided, and thus most probably influenced the 
results. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The product is indicated in various malignant conditions for reduction in the duration of neutropenia and 
the incidence of febrile neutropenia in patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy for malignancy (with 
the exception of chronic myeloid leukaemia and myelodysplastic syndromes). 
Although the incidence and type of cancer that occurs in adults and paediatric population are different, 
chemotherapy  is  a  cornerstone  of  anti-cancer  therapy  in  both  populations.  As  chemotherapy  affects 
rapidly  dividing  cells,  many  chemotherapy  regimens  are  myelotoxic,  and  neutropenia  is  frequently 
reported for chemotherapy regimens, this applies both for regimes commonly used for the treatment of 
adult cancer patients and for regimes commonly in paediatric cancer patients.  
Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is the major dose-limiting toxicity for many cytotoxic chemotherapy 
regimens, a subsequent cycle of chemotherapy may have to be delayed until the patient has recovered.  
In the paediatric population, chemotherapy-induced neutropenia is the primary dose-limiting toxicity in 
patients  receiving  myelosuppressive  chemotherapy  and  results  in  a  high  risk  of  life-threatening 
infections. Children on intensive chemotherapy protocols have a 6 times greater chance of developing 
sepsis than more conservative protocols.  
The  frequency  of  drug-induced  neutropenia  differs  between  adult  and  paediatric  population  by  which 
febrile neutropenia occurs more frequently in paediatric cancer patients then adults. This is partly due 
to more aggressive (myelosuppressive) chemotherapy schedules that are used in children. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factors (G-CSFs) are pharmaceutical agents that are used 
to prevent chemotherapy (CTX)-induced neutropenia. They restore the number of neutrophils and keep 
the neutrophil count above the critical level at which the risk of febrile neutropenia (FN) is increased.  
For  adults  several  filgrastim  and  pegfilgrastim  products  are  approved  for  reduction  in  the  duration  of 
neutropenia and the incidence of FN. Also, Lonquex is approved for this indication in adults. Currently, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/642324/2022 
Page 139/146 
 
 
 
 
 
 
only the G-CSF products with active substance filgrastim have been approved to reduce the duration and 
incidence  of  neutropenia  in  paediatric  patients  receiving  myelosuppressive  chemotherapies.  The 
pegylated  filgrastim  products  that  have  a  prolonged  pharmacodynamic  effect  and  thereby  allowing  a 
single injection per CTX cycle are not approved for paediatric cancer patients whereas the need of only 
a single subcutaneous injection per cycle of CTX would provide a benefit for children. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Two clinical studies have been conducted in paediatric patients: 
XM22-07:  A  Phase  I,  multinational,  multicentre,  open  label  uncontrolled  study  to  assess  the 
pharmacokinetics,  pharmacodynamics,  efficacy,  safety,  tolerability  and  immunogenicity  of  a  single 
subcutaneous dose of  100µg/kg  lipegfilgrastim  (Lonquex)  (up to  a  maximum of  6  mg)  in 21  children 
with Ewing family of tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma.  
A single dose of lipegfilgrastim was administered SC approximately 24 hours (+6 hours) after the end 
of the last CTX (VIDE, VDC/IE, VAC, or IVA) administration in week 1 of the specific regimen. 
XM22-08:  A  Phase  II  open  label,  randomized,  active  controlled,  multinational,  multicenter  study  to 
evaluate the efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 
lipegfilgrastim  (100  μg/kg  body  weight)  in  comparison  to  filgrastim  (5  μg/kg  body  weight)  in  42 
paediatric patients (21 per group) diagnosed with Ewing family of tumours or rhabdomyosarcoma.  
In  each  of  the  treatment  cycles  of  CTX  (VIDE,  VDC/IE,  VAC,  IVA  or  IVADo),  lipegfilgrastim  was 
administered SC on day 1 of the cycles (every 3 weeks) approximately 24 hours (+6 hours) after the 
end  of  the  last  CTX administration  in  week  1  of  the  specific  regimen.  The  filgrastim  5  μg/kg  was 
administered once daily for at least 5 consecutive days per cycle [maximum of 14 days]). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the controlled XM22-08 study against filgrastim, approved treatment in children, the similar response 
was  obtained  in  the  primary  endpoint  (PP  population),  DSN  in  Cycle  1  2.7  days  (SD;  2.25)  in  the 
lipegfilgrastim group and 2.5 days (SD; 2.09) in filgrastim group. By the Poisson analysis the difference 
between the treatments was 1.0 (95% CI; -0.21, 2.26) in PP population and 0.4 (95% CI; -0.92, 1.72) 
in FAS population utilizing treatment, age cohort, and baseline ANC values as covariates. 
In the secondary endpoints, the primary analysis was performed in the PP population in all parameters. 
The  incidence  of  FN  was  7/20  (35%)  and  8/19  (42%)  in  filgrastim  and  lipegfilgrastim  groups, 
respectively. By the Poisson regression analysis, the LS mean difference for the DSN in cycles 2 to 4 
ranged  from  -0.1 to  -0.4  between  lipegfilgrastim  and  filgrastim  groups.  Any  statistically  meaningful 
difference was present in any of the CTX cycles, the p-value ranging from 0.522 to 0.846. The overall 
incidence  of  very  severe  neutropenia  was  also  similar,  the  frequencies  being  70%  (14/20)  vs.  68% 
(13/19),  respectively,  and  the  mean  duration  by  CTX  cycle  ranging  from  1.1  to  1.4  days  in  the 
lipegfilgrastim group and from 0.8 to 1.3 days in the filgrastim group. Regarding the time to absolute 
neutrophils count (ANC) nadir from the start of CTX or IMP administration, the range of mean time was 
8.8 to 11 and 6.4 to 8.5 days, respectively, in the filgrastim group and around 9 days and 6.5 days, 
respectively, in the lipegfilgrastim group.  The range in the mean duration to ANC >1.0 × 109/L recovery 
from the CTX-day 1 was 10.0 to 10.6 days vs. 8.2 to 11.9 days in cycles 1 to 4 in the lipegfilgrastim and 
filgrastim  groups,  respectively.  The  respective  ranges  for  the  mean  duration  to  ANC  >2.0  ×  109/L 
recovery were 12.3 to 15.1 days and 13.8 to 15.3 days. The range in the mean duration to ANC >1.0 × 
109/L recovery from nadir was 3.1 to 4.9 days vs. 2.4 to 5.3 days in cycles 1 to 4 in the lipegfilgrastim

and filgrastim groups, respectively. The respective ranges for the mean duration to ANC >2.0 × 109/L 
recovery were 5.7 to 10.1 days and 8.2 to 9.1 days.  
In the secondary endpoints, the results in the ITT population were consistent with the results obtained 
in the PP population. 
The patients in the lipegfilgrastim group received the IMP once per CTX cycle (4 injections total; mean 
value)  while  the  dosing  frequency  in  the  filgrastim  group  was  five  injections  per  treatment  cycle 
(31.7 injections total; mean value), the dosing frequency being in favour for the lipegfilgrastim. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The  XM22-08  study  data  was  descriptive  at  best  and  not  powered  limiting  the  value  of  the  study  in 
comparison between lipegfilgrastim and filgrastim. The conclusions on the similarity of the lipegfilgrastim 
treatment  between  the  children  (studies  XM22-07  and  XM22-08)  and  adults  (studies  XM22-03  and 
XM22-04 studies) is hampered by the host-, disease-, and treatment-related differences between the 
study  populations.  Furthermore,  it  is  unclear  how  representative  the  current  data  are  to  bridge  the 
efficacy of lipegfilgrastim to the already approved filgrastim treatment in children. 
Very limited descriptive efficacy and safety data are available for lipegfilgrastim in paediatric patients: 
in total 42 paediatric patients have been exposed (out of which 14 patients with the age range of 2-6 
years,  with  only  7  patients  of  2-3-year-old).  Therefore,  extrapolation  of  efficacy  and  safety  from  the 
adult  data  are  considered  a  critical  part  of  this  paediatric  extension  of  indication,  without  which 
assessment of benefit/risk balance is not possible. The currently presented extrapolation framework is 
sufficient to support a positive benefit/risk balance in children ≥2 years of age. The population PK/PD 
model provides support for the notion that efficacy of lipegfilgrastim can be extrapolated from adults to 
children. Although the PK/PD model does indicate minor differences in neutrophil physiology, such as a 
23%  lower  neutrophil  precursor  production  rate  in  children  versus  adults,  the  model  overall  contains 
parameter  values  for  adults  and  children  that  are  either  identical  or  similar,  while  at  the  same  time 
successfully predicting neutrophil responses in both adults and children. The model contains mechanistic 
elements, which is considered a strength when the model is used to support extrapolation. 
The MAH proposes a weight-band dosing scheme for children, even though the clinical studies have been 
conducted with a weight-based 100µg/kg dose. As such, the switch from the studied dosing regimen to 
a new dosing regimen introduces an additional level of uncertainty to both favourable and unfavourable 
effects. A PK/PD model is used to justify the proposed weight-band dosing scheme, which is different 
from  the  clinically  studied  100  µg/kg  dosing  scheme.  The  proposed  weight-band  dosing  scheme  is 
considered  acceptable  even  though  it  results  in  slightly  higher  predicted  variability  in  paediatric 
lipegfilgrastim exposures, when compared to the originally studied precise dosing of 100µg/kg. 
The extrapolation of PK-PD to children aged 6 months to 2 years raised questions, which, however, 
were resolved since the MAH withdrew the indication for this youngest age group. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of lipegfilgrastim, in paediatric patients from 2 to 17 years of age, was examined in 
two studies, in a single dose phase 1 study with 21 patients and in an open label, controlled, phase 2 
study, with 42 patients (21 on lipegfilgrastim and 21 on the active control filgrastim), with three age 
categories: 2 to <6, 6 to <12 and 12 to <17 years of age.  
During the treatment period of the single dose study XM22-07, all 21 patients reported at least 1 adverse 
event  with  a  total  of  142  events  reported.  Twenty  (95.2%)  patients  experienced  102  treatment-
Assessment report

emergent adverse events. A total of 3 adverse events in 2 patients were considered to be XM22-related 
(2 neutrophil count increased) and 1 patient reported back and bone pain. These 3 events were all mild 
in severity. No SAE, deaths, or discontinuations were reported. 
In the treatment period of study XM22-08 the most common adverse events (≥30% patients in both 
the  treatment  groups,  i.e.  lipegfilgrastim  and  filgrastim,  respectively)  in  the  system  organ  classes 
appeared similar and included blood and lymphatic system disorders (86% vs 100%), gastrointestinal 
disorders  (67%  vs  62%),  general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions  (52%  vs  33%), 
investigations  (48%  vs  33%),  and  infections  and  infestations  (38%  vs  33%).  At  PT  level  for  similar 
numbers of patients in each treatment group; most common reported in at least 50% of patients in any 
treatment group, were anaemia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and vomiting.  
Most SAE occurred with similar frequency (approximately 60% in both groups). A few SAEs were reported 
more frequently (>10% difference) in 1 group or the other: SAEs more common in the lipegfilgrastim 
group were thrombocytopenia (9 patients in lipegfilgrastim group; 3 patients in filgrastim group) and 
lymphopenia (7 patients in lipegfilgrastim group; 4 patients in filgrastim group). SAEs more common in 
the filgrastim group were leukopenia and febrile neutropenia. Among all SAEs, only 1 (Grade 1 pyrexia) 
in the filgrastim group was considered related to treatment.  
In the follow up period of study XM22-08, altogether 3 patients of 42 patients continuing the study died 
during the follow up period with 1 patient from the lipegfilgrastim group. Acknowledging the limitations 
in assessment of these data, no trends on increased progression of the underlying disease or mortality 
was seen associated with lipegfilgrastim in comparison to filgrastim group. However, a higher percentage 
of patients with SAE’s was seen in the lipegfilgrastim group compared filgrastim (62% vs. 24%), relating 
mainly to differences in haematological changes (thrombocytopenia and leukopenia).  
No  patient  developed  persistent  ADA  response  in  XM22-08  study  and  the  two  cases,  one  in  each 
treatment arm, had low titers and the antibodies were non-neutralising. 
In the two submitted paediatric studies, the single dose study XM22-07 and the small controlled (active 
control  filgrastim)  multi  dose  study  XM22-08,  the  safety  profiles  of  Lonquex  (lipegfilgrastim)  in  the 
sought paediatric indication seemed broadly similar to that of filgrastim. When comparing the accrued 
lipegfilgrastim  safety  data  in  children  aged  from  2  to  less  than  18  years  of  age  to  that  of  the  adult 
development programme, the safety profiles were also largely similar.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The numbers in the two provided paediatric studies were small and consequently, all the age subgroups 
are  not  adequately  supported  by  the  provided  data.  In  all,  21  patients in  the single  dose  study,  with 
seven patients in each age group and 42 patients (21 on the lipegfilgrastim and 21 on filgrastim, with 
seven patients in each of the age subgroups), which limits the interpretation of data. Thus, these data 
are considered at best supportive.  
Objectivity of pooling the safety data between the two paediatric studies is questioned considering the 
difference in settings (single dose and multiple dose) and the uncontrolled nature of the Phase 1 trial. 
Differences in host-, disease-, and underlying cancer treatments, between the different study samples 
hamper the comparison of the safety data. 
Acknowledging the limitations of the provided paediatric data, the safety profile in paediatric patients on 
lipegfilgrastim  treatment,  seems  overall  similar  to  the  safety  profile  of  the  patients  on  filgrastim  and 
similar to the safety profile in adults, but some differences were seen in the frequency of the TEAEs. 
These differences appeared to be paediatric (not lipegfilgrastim) and could even be attributable to the 
cancer treatments.

An overall integrated description of the extrapolation exercise, which includes also safety issues, was 
presented by the MAH upon request in the 1st RSI response. The submitted paediatric safety data cover 
patients from 2 years to the adolescents < 18 years of age. A multidisciplinary safety concern was raised, 
but  ultimately  resolved  on  issues  related  to  the  possible  risks  associated  with  the  PEG-moiety  of 
lipegfilgrastim.  A  thorough  discussion  of  the  currently  available  data  was  provided.  It  was  concluded, 
that considering the limited treatment period and the monthly PEG exposures, it is agreed with the MAH, 
that potential risks due to PEG accumulation in children ≥ 2 years of age treated with Lonquex are likely 
to be low. 
The MAH proposes a weight-band dosing scheme for children, even though the clinical studies have been 
conducted with a weight-based 100µg/kg dose. As such, the switch from the studied dosing regimen to 
a new dosing regimen introduces an additional level of uncertainty to both favourable and unfavourable 
effects. A PK/PD model is used to justify the proposed weight-band dosing scheme, which is different 
from  the  clinically  studied  100  µg/kg  dosing  scheme.  The  proposed  weight-band  dosing  scheme  is 
considered  acceptable  even  though  it  results  in  slightly  higher  predicted  variability  in  paediatric 
lipegfilgrastim exposures, when compared to the originally studied precise dosing of 100µg/kg.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The obvious advantage of the lipegfilgrastim treatment is the more infrequent dosing comparing to the 
available options to reduce neutropenia in the severely affected children. This allows less burdensome 
treatment and fewer visits to the clinical unit to receive treatment.  
Although,  the  clinical  data  does  not  exclude  the  possibility  for  similar  efficacy  and  safety  of  the 
lipegfilgrastim  and  filgrastim  already  indicated  in  children,  there  were  limitations  regarding  the  small 
sample  size  of  the  trials,  uncontrolled  nature  of  the  other  study,  and  short  duration  of  the  follow-up 
period, to form any firm conclusions on the data. In addition, no data are available for the 6mo-2-year-
old children. Therefore, extrapolation of efficacy and safety from the adult data are considered a critical 
part  of  this  pediatric  extension  of  indication,  without  which  assessment  of  benefit/risk  balance  is  not 
possible.  The  currently  presented  extrapolation  framework  is  considered  appropriate  for  children  ≥2 
years of age.  
Important unfavourable effects in paediatric patients included anaemia, thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia, and vomiting. These are considered well known for all G-CSF products and manageable 
but could also be attributable to the disease itself and to the concurrent cancer treatments. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The overall B/R of Lonquex in the proposed paediatric indication is positive for children ≥2 years of age.  
A  weight-band  dosing  scheme  is  proposed  for  children,  even  though  the  clinical  studies  have  been 
conducted  with  a  weight-based  100µg/kg  dose,  and  a  PK/PD  model  is  used  to  justify  the  proposed 
weight-band dosing scheme.

3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
It is relevant to note that although the plans to extrapolate the indication down to 6 months of age was 
included in the PIP, and the plan was approved by the PDCO, the MAH has withdrawn children below 
2 years of age from the proposed indication during the evaluation of the application. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Lonquex in the proposed paediatric indication is positive for children ≥2 years of 
age.

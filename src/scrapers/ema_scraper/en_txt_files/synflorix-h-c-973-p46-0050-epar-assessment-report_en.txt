cross-reactive serotypes 6A and 19A.

• 
Level of anti-dPly antibodies inhibiting Ply haemolysis activity. 
•  Statistical Methods 
Safety /reactogenicity: 
Analysis of safety was performed on Total Vaccinated cohort. 
Confirmatory inferential analysis: 
The  impact  of  each  protein  formulation  (pooled  groups  i.e.  regardless  of  dose)  on  the  percentage  of 
subjects  with  grade  3  fever  (rectal  temperature  >  40.0°C)  was  demonstrated  through  asymptotic 
standardized  95%  CI  on  group  difference  (10PP*  minus  10Pn  OR  PlPh*  minus  10Pn)  in  terms  of 
percentage  of  subjects  with  grade  3  fever  within  the  7-day  follow-up  period  (day  0-day  6)  following 
primary vaccinations. 
The primary objective was considered reached if: 
the 95% CIs for the defined difference included 0 OR 
the upper limit of the 95% CI around this difference was below 10%. 
Descriptive analysis: 
Incidence  of  solicited  and/or  unsolicited  local  and/or  general  AEs  during  the  31-day  postvaccination 
follow-up  period  was  calculated  with  exact  95%  confidence  interval  (CI),  according  to  the  type  of 
symptom, intensity and relationship to vaccination. 
Incidence of each local and each general solicited symptom reported during the 7-day postvaccination 
follow-up  period  was  calculated  with  exact  95%  CI,  according  to  the  type  of  symptom,  intensity  and 
relationship to vaccination. 
The  percentages  of  subjects/doses  with  an  unsolicited  symptom  reported  within  the  31-day 
postvaccination  follow-up period  were  summarized  according  to the  Medical Dictionary  for  Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA), with exact 95% CI, according to the intensity and relationship to vaccination. 
The  number  and  percentage  of  subjects  who  took  or  doses  with  concomitant  antipyretic/medication 
taken during the 7-day post-vaccination period was computed with exact 95% CI. 
Serious  adverse  events  (SAEs),  large  swelling  reactions  and  withdrawals  due  to  adverse  events 
reported during the entire study period were described in detail. 
Immunogenicity 
Analysis of immunogenicity was performed on ATP cohort for immunogenicity.  
Descriptive analysis: 
Geometric  mean  concentrations/titres  (GMCs/GMTs),  seropositivity  rates  were  calculated  with  their 
95%  CI  for  each  group  and  each  antigen,  prior to  dose  1, post-dose  2,  prior to  and one  month  after 
the booster vaccination. 
Distribution  of  antibody  concentrations/titres  was  displayed  using  tables  and/or  reverse  cumulative 
curves  for  each  group  and  each  antigen,  prior  to  dose  1,  post-dose  2,  prior  to  and  one  month  post-
booster vaccination.

Immunogenicity results 
Summary:  
The  combined  10Pn-PD-DiT/dPly/PhtD  formulations  induced  an  immune  response  to  the 
pneumococcal  serotype-specific  polysaccharide  conjugates  and  protein  D,  following  primary  and 
booster vaccination: 
  One  month  post-dose  2,  for  each  of  the  vaccine  pneumococcal  serotypes,  antibody 
concentrations  ≥0.2  µg/mL  were  observed  in  at  least  97.5%  of  subjects  receiving  a 
combined 10Pn-PD-DiT/dPly/PhtD formulations or 10Pn-PD-DiT, except for serotype 6B (at 
least  78.3%  for  the  combined  10Pn-PD-DiT/  dPly/PhtD  formulations  and  85.4%  for  10Pn-
PD-DiT)  and  serotype  23F  (at  least  89.7%  for  the  combined  10Pn-PD-DiT/dPly/PhtD 
formulations  and  92.7%  for  10Pn-PD-DiT).  Post-booster  vaccination,  this  percentage  was 
at  least  97.5%  for  the  combined  10Pn-PD-DiT/dPly/PhtD  formulations  and  10Pn-PD-DiT, 
except  for  serotype  6B  (at  least  89.4%  for  the  combined  10Pn-PD-DiT/  dPly/PhtD 
formulations and 95.0% for 10Pn-PD-DiT). 
  One  month  post-dose  2,  for  each  of  the  vaccine  pneumococcal  serotypes,  OPA  titres  ≥8 
were  observed  in  at  least  80.0%  of  subjects  receiving  the  combined  10Pn-PD-
DiT/dPly/PhtD formulations or 10Pn-PD-DiT, except for serotype 6B (at least 74.1% for the 
combined 10Pn-PD-DiT/dPly/PhtD formulations and 96.4% for 10Pn-PD-DiT). Post-booster 
vaccination,  this  percentage  was  at  least 89.2%  for  the  combined  10Pn-PD-DiT/dPly/PhtD 
formulations, except serotype 6B (at least 84.8%) and at least 94.6% for 10Pn-PD-DiT. 
In groups receiving combined 10Pn-PD-DiT/dPly/PhtD formulations or 10Pn-PD-DiT: 
 
 
For  each  of  the  vaccine  pneumococcal  serotypes,  antibody  GMCs  and  OPA  GMTs 
increased from pre- to post-booster vaccination. 
  One month post-dose 2 and one month post-booster vaccination, at least 97.4% of 
subjects  receiving  PD-containing  formulations  had  anti-protein  D  antibody 
concentrations ≥112 LU/mL. 
Increases  in  anti-PD  antibody  GMCs  were  observed  from  pre-vaccination  to  post-
dose 2 and from pre- to post-booster vaccination. 
 
  The pneumococcal proteins PhtD and dPly alone or combined with 10Pn-PD-DiT induced an 
immune response following primary and booster vaccination: 
  One month post-dose 2 and one month post-booster vaccination, at least 97.7% of 
subjects  receiving  a  pneumococcal  protein-containing  formulation  had  anti-dPly 
antibody concentrations ≥599 LU/mL and anti-PhtD antibody concentrations ≥391 
LU/mL. 
Increases  in  anti-dPly  and  anti-PhtD  antibody  GMCs  were  observed  from 
prevaccination to post-dose 2 and from pre- to post-booster vaccination.

Assessor’s comment: The  immunogenicity results for the control group are in agreement with 
previously presented results and do not cause any further concern regarding immunogenicity. 
•  Safety results 
Confirmatory inferential analysis 
The  primary  objective  of  the  SPNG-002  study  was  demonstrated  as  the  95%  CIs  for  the 
difference between groups [10PP minus 10Pn OR PlPh minus 10Pn] in terms  of percentage of 
subjects reporting grade 3 fever (rectal temperature > 40.0°C) within 7 days after at least one 
primary  vaccination  include  0,  meaning  that  no  statistical  difference  was  detected  between 
groups for both comparisons.

and  most  of  them  were  accompanied  by  redness  and  pain.  All  reactions  resolved  completely  without 
sequelae, mostly within 2 days.

reported following one dose of the dPly/PhtD formulation at 10 μg of each protein. 
During the 31-day post-booster vaccination period:

dose  of  the  investigational  formulations  (i.e.  dPly/PhtD  or  combined  10Pn-PD-DiT/dPly/PhtD 
formulations), while this percentage was 18.0% for 10Pn-PD-DiT.

•  One  subject  receiving  the  dPly/PhtD  formulation  at  30  μg  of  each  protein  reported  a  grade  3 
unsolicited AE (cystitis). 
•  Unsolicited  AEs  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  causally  related  to  vaccination  were 
reported by a maximum of 3.9% of subjects across all groups. 
Serious adverse events 
A  total  of  17  subjects  reported  at  least  one  SAE  during  the  entire  study  period,  all  of  them  in  the 
primary epoch of the study. None of the reported SAEs had a fatal outcome or was considered by the 
investigator to be causally related to vaccination. All SAEs resolved without sequelae except one (type 
1 diabetes mellitus) which was improving at the time of study end. 
Withdrawals due to adverse events /serious adverse events: 
One subject in the 10Pn group was withdrawn from the study during the primary epoch due to a non 
serious AE. This subject was diagnosed with eczema, 3 days after the administration of the first dose of 
10Pn-PD-DiT.  The  event  resolved  within  41  days  and  was  not  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be 
causally related to vaccination. The decision to withdraw the subject from the study was made by the 
parents. 
Assessor’s comment: No new safety signal was detected relating to Synflorix in this study.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Type II variation 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Pierre Fabre Medicament submitted 
to the European Medicines Agency on 14 October 2019 an application for a variation following a 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008.  
The following variation was requested:

Extension of indication to include encorafenib in combination with binimetinib and cetuximab, for the 
treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) with a BRAF V600E mutation, who 
have received prior systemic therapy, as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 of 
the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. The RMP version 1.1 has also been 
submitted. Furthermore, the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10.1. 
The worksharing procedure requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
The MAH in the course of the assessment withdrew Mektovi (binimetinib) from the applied indication. 
Therefore, the extension of indication only concerns the product Braftovi (encorafenib). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  an  EMA  Decision(s) 
P/0049/2019  for  encorafenib  (Braftovi)  and  P/0037/2019  for  binimetinib  (Mektovi)  on  the  granting  of  a 
(product-specific) waiver. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the WSA did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
WSA request for additional market protection 
The WSA requested consideration of its application in accordance with Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) 
726/2004 - one year of market protection for a new indication.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The intended indication is: encorafenib in combination with binimetinib and cetuximab, for the treatment 
of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) with a BRAF V600E mutation, who have received 
prior systemic therapy. 
Epidemiology  
Globally, CRC is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide, with about 1.3 million new cases 
and over 550,000 deaths (GLOBOCAN, 2018). It is also the second most common type of cancer and the 
second deadliest cancer in Europe with an estimated 500,000 new cases diagnosed in 2018 and around 
242,000 deaths (Ferlay, 2018).  
Despite major treatment advances over the past decades, metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) remains a 
serious, life-threatening condition, with significant years of potential life lost and substantial losses 
in productivity due to high incidence rates (Bradley, 2011). 
Biologic features 
At diagnosis, 8 -12% of metastatic colorectal cancers harbour BRAF mutations (Troiani, 2016) with a 
broad range of estimates ranging from as low as 5% to as high as 21%. These mutations are usually (> 
95%) at the V600E codon and essentially mutually exclusive with RAS mutations (Barras, 2017; Bylsma, 
2018; Clarke, 2015; Davies, 2002; De Roock, 2010; Sorbye, 2015). BRAF V600 mutations lead to 
constitutive activation of BRAF kinase and sustained RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway signalling, resulting in 
increased cell proliferation and survival (Corcoran, 2012).  
In a recent metanalysis, BRAF mutant CRC tumours that are microsatellite -instability high (MSI-H) have 
been shown to have a better prognosis than those with a proficient DNA mismatch repair system in all 
stages of disease except for mCRC, in which MSI-H showed poor effects on OS in BRAF wildtype patients 
but not in BRAF-mutant patients (Yang, 2018). The incidence of MSI in CRC varies according to the stage 
of the disease, with a low incidence in the metastatic setting (4%-5%) (Battaglin, 2018), which suggests 
that the majority of BRAF mutant- mCRC tumours are microsatellite stable (MSS). 
Clinical presentation and diagnosis  
Approximately 25% of newly diagnosed CRC patients present with metastases and 50% of patients 
eventually develop metastatic disease (Van Cutsem, 2014). 
Overall survival (OS) for patients with mCRC has now reached durations of 30 months or longer in the 
most recent generation of randomised clinical trials (Vogel, 2018; Venook, 2014; Loupakis, 2014, 
Heinemann, 2013); however, the 5-year survival for the 22% of patients who are initially diagnosed with 
metastatic disease is 14% (SEER, 2018). The key contributors for longer survival are the increase in 
resection rates of metastases at diagnosis, emerging treatment options in the therapeutic sequence but 
also improvement of first-line therapies.  
BRAF V600-mutant CRC is considered a distinct subtype of CRC that has unique clinical characteristics 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/271532/2020 
Page 10/224 
 
 
  
  
and is associated with a worse prognosis, with a negative impact on both overall survival (OS) and 
progression-free survival (PFS) (Cremolini, 2015; Loupakis, 2014; Ursem, 2018). In a cohort of 524 
patients, OS for patients with BRAF-mutant colorectal cancer was 10.4 months compared with 34.7 
months for BRAF wild-type patients. In a multivariate analysis, the hazard ratio (HR) for survival was 
10.662 (p < 0.001) (Tran, 2011); the situation is similar in patients with failure of prior systemic therapy 
(De Roock, 2010; Peeters, 2014b), emphasizing the need to develop novel therapeutic approaches. 
Management 
BRAF genetic testing is currently recommended by the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), and Japanese Society for Medical Oncology (JESMO) for 
all patients with CRC tumours as a prognostic indicator (Van Cutsem, 2016; NCCN V2, 2019; Yamazaki, 
2018).The standard first-line therapy for metastatic disease consists of a combination of chemotherapy 
(based on fluoropyrimidine/leucovorin (5-FU/LV) or capecitabine with irinotecan or oxaliplatin, or in 
combination with both) with targeted agents (monoclonal antibodies targeting the vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF) – bevacizumab – and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) – panitumumab 
and cetuximab) (Vogel, 2018). 
Currently, there are no agents specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with BRAF V600Emutant 
mCRC and all therapies used in this setting have never been tested in dedicated phase 3 studies. 
Since BRAF and KRAS mutations are almost always mutually exclusive (De Roock, 2010; Zheng, 2019), 
patients with BRAF V600E-mutant mCRC have typically been treated with standard of-care regimens for 
KRAS wild-type (KRASwt) mCRC in the first line setting i.e. a combination of chemotherapy (based on 
fluoropyrimidine/leucovorin (5-FU/LV) or capecitabine with or without irinotecan, oxaliplatin, or in 
combination with both) with targeted agents (monoclonal antibodies targeting the vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF), mostly bevacizumab or the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), i.e. 
panitumumab and cetuximab) (Vogel, 2018). 
Recommended second-line options depend on the first-line treatment regimen. Common second-line 
regimens include infusional FOLFIRI or irinotecan with or without cetuximab or panitumumab. The 
combination of irinotecan/cetuximab is one of the options recommended by the ESMO and NCCN for 
patients who have previously received irinotecan- or oxaliplatin-based combination regimens, and its use 
in this setting is consistent with current labelling of cetuximab (Van Cutsem, 2016; NCCN V2, 2019). 
FOLFIRI has also been used in the control arm of several recent Phase 3 studies in the second-line setting 
in patients with mCRC unselected for specific mutations (Peeters, 2014b; Tabernero, 2015). 
The median OS for patients with BRAF V600E mutant mCRC, who have failed one prior line of treatment 
is 10 to 14 months and for patients who have failed 2 prior lines of treatment it is 6 to 9 months 
(Seymour, 2013; Peeters, 2010, Grothey, 2013; Li, 2015; Van Cutsem, 2019; Longo-Muñoz, 2017). A 
retrospective study reported similar PFS of 5 to 6 months irrespective of whether oxaliplatin- or 
irinotecan-based chemotherapy was administered in the first-line setting in patients with BRAF-mutant 
mCRC (Morris, 2014). The more intensive regimen of infusional 5-FU/FA/oxaliplatin/irinotecan 
(FOLFOXIRI) + bevacizumab has been shown to be both more active and more toxic than typical 
irinotecan- or oxaliplatin-based regimens (Cremolini, 2015; Loupakis, 2014), which is in line with the 
results of studies of irinotecan or FOLFIRI, with or without anti-EGFR (Seymour, 2013; Peeters, 2010). 
The EMA approved the single -agents regorafenib and trifluridine + tipiracil as oral salvage therapies in 
patients with chemorefractory disease, who have been previously treated with fluoropyrimidine-, 
oxaliplatin- and irinotecan- based chemotherapy, and antiVEGF- biological therapy and, if patients are 
RAS wild type, an antiEGFR- therapy, irrespective of KRAS or BRAF mutational status. Current ESMO and 
NCCN guidelines include these agents as an additional line of therapy in patients with mCRC who have 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/271532/2020 
Page 11/224 
 
 
  
  
progressed through standard therapies (Van Cutsem, 2016; NCCN V2, 2019). However, they are 
minimally active with OS ranging from 6.4 to 8.8 months, a PFS of 1.9 to 3.2 months and an ORR of 1% 
to 6 % in BRAF wild type mCRC (Grothey, 2013; Mayer, 2015). 
The use of single-agent BRAF inhibitors or of a combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors without the 
addition of an EGFR inhibitor has shown minimal clinical activity in BRAF V600E-mutant mCRC (Hyman, 
2015; Kopetz, 2015), potentially due to feedback reactivation of EGFR (Corcoran, 2012; Prahallad,2012). 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Binimetinib (ATC code L01XE41; product name Mektovi) and encorafenib (ATC code L01XE46; product 
name Braftovi) are two protein kinase inhibitors labelled to be specifically a MEK and a BRAF inhibitor. 
Both products (each containing single active substances) received their first Marketing Authorisation (MA) 
within the EU in the indication(s) ‘for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation’ concomitantly on 20/09/2018. The pivotal trial for the melanoma 
application is known as the COLOMBUS study. 
Of note in this overall context of tumours diagnosed specifically for mutations is that prior to the first EU 
MA for the product Mektovi, the MAH had applied for an (initial) MA for binimetinib as monotherapy in 
patients with NRAS mutant melanoma. This first application has been withdrawn prior to granting a MA to 
the product(s) Mektovi and Braftovi (in a, by mutation, different indication). The pivotal trial of this 
withdrawn application is known as the NEMO study. 
The current application, a work sharing procedure initially applied for the 2 products (Mektovi/Braftovi) of 
the applicant/MAH, concerns 3 substances (binimetinib, cetuximab [monoclonal Ab, ATC L01XC06], 
encorafenib) to be administered as a free combination, orally and intravenously, in adult patients with 
mCRC with a BRAF V600E mutation. 
The MAH in the course of the assessment withdrew the binimitenib portion (Mektovi) of the indication, 
therefore the extension of indication only affects encorafenib (Braftovi). 
The applicant of this procedure had searched regulatory advice in the past for planning the pivotal trial of 
this (WSP) application, known now as the BEACON study (ARRAY-818-302) (a multicenter, randomized, 
open-label, 3-arm phase 3 study of encorafenib + cetuximab plus or minus binimetinib vs. 
irinotecan/cetuximab or infusional 5-fluorouracil (5-fu)/folinic acid (FA)/irinotecan (FOLFIRI)/cetuximab 
with a safety lead-in of encorafenib + binimetinib + cetuximab in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant 
metastatic colorectal cancer. 
This is/are, in the terminology of BEACON, the ‘Doublet’ (and control) arm actually investigated in a 
randomized way. To develop rather, a clinical trial with three arms, with the primary objective to show 
that ‘Triplet’ is superior to Control (standard of care, investigators/centres chosen standard of care), is a 
more recent development in the clinical development program of the applicant (of this WSP). 
On January 21, 2020 the document “StudyARRAY-818-302 (BEACON) Summary of updated results 
(August 2019 Data Cutoff); Date: January 2020” was received.  
Encorafenib is indicated: 
- in combination with binimetinib for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic 
melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation. 
- in combination with cetuximab, for the treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer 
(CRC) with a BRAF V600E mutation, who have received prior systemic therapy.

Encorafenib treatment should be initiated and supervised under the responsibility of a physician 
experienced in the use of anticancer medicinal products. 
Melanoma 
The recommended dose of encorafenib is 450 mg (six 75 mg capsules) once daily, when used in 
combination with binimetinib. 
Colorectal cancer  
The recommended dose of encorafenib is 300 mg (four 75 mg capsules) once daily, when used in 
combination with cetuximab.  
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
In terms of CHMP scientific advice and the development of a combination, therapy in BRAF mutated CRC, 
the dossier of this procedure contains first CHMP advices as early as of 2015 
EMEA/H/SA/3177/1/2015/SME/II, EMEA/H/SA/3177/2/2016/SME/II, 
EMEA/H/SA/3177/2/FU/1/2016/SME/II and EMEA/H/SA/3177/1/FU/1/2018/II. These advices, over their 
time course, however, concerned initially the planning of a confirmatory trial concerning the substances 
(as of different substance classes) encorafenib and cetuximab only. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
In order to support the new indication, previous data from in vitro and in vivo studies with encorafenib in 
combination with cetuximab and encorafenib as single agent have been re-analysed with the focus of the 
doublet combination. However, the initially provided data are still valid.  New non-clinical studies have 
been performed to underline the new indication.  
Encorafenib is a potent and highly selective ATP-competitive small molecule RAF kinase inhibitor 
Encorafenib suppresses the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway in tumour cells expressing several mutated forms of 
BRAF kinase (V600E, D and K). Specifically, encorafenib inhibits in vitro and in vivo BRAFV600E, D and K 
mutant melanoma cell growth. Encorafenib does not inhibit RAF/MEK/ERK signalling in cells expressing 
wild-type BRAF. 
Binimetinib is an ATP-uncompetitive, reversible inhibitor of the kinase activity of mitogen-activated 
extracellular signal regulated kinase 1 (MEK1) and MEK2. In cell free system, binimetinib inhibits MEK1 
and MEK2 with the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50)’s in the 12-46 nM. MEK proteins are 
upstream regulators of the extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) pathway, which promotes cellular 
proliferation. In melanoma and other cancers, this pathway is often activated by mutated forms of BRAF 
which activates MEK. Binimetinib inhibits activation of MEK by BRAF and inhibits MEK kinase activity. 
Binimetinib inhibits growth of BRAF V600 mutant melanoma cell lines and demonstrates anti-tumour 
effects in BRAF V600 mutant melanoma animal models. 
The combination of binimetinib and encorafenib both inhibit the MAPK pathway resulting in higher anti-
tumour activity.  
Cetuximab is a chimeric monoclonal Immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibody directed against the Epidermal 
Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR). EGFR signaling pathways are involved in the control of cell survival, cell 
cycle progression, angiogenesis, cell migration and cellular invasion/metastasis. Cetuximab binds to the 
EGFR with an affinity higher than that of endogenous ligands. Cetuximab blocks binding of endogenous 
EGFR ligands resulting in inhibition of the function of the receptor and induces the internalization of EGFR,

Page 13/224 
 
 
  
  
 
 
which can lead to down-regulation of the receptor. Cetuximab also targets cytotoxic immune effector cells 
towards EGFR-expressing tumour cells (antibody dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, ADCC). 
Non-clinical documentation submitted with this application concerns studies on primary pharmacology in 
order to evaluate the magnitude of activity of binimetinib when combined with encorafenib and with or 
without cetuximab. No PK, ADME or toxicology studies have been performed with the combination.  
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
MEKTOVI (Binimetinib, MEK162) 
Effect of ARRY-438162 on the growth of subcutaneous Colo-205 xenografts in female nude 
mice Study Number 060304-789 
The purpose of this non-GLP study was to evaluate the MEK inhibitor ARRY-438162 (binimetinib) for its 
ability to inhibit the growth of Colo-205 (human colon carcinoma) subcutaneous xenografts in female 
nude mice. Colo-205 cells harbor the BRAF V600E mutation and the p53 Y103 L111 > L in frame deletion, 
ARRY-438162 was dosed PO, QD at 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg for 19 days. 
Overall, ARRY-438162 was well tolerated at all three doses over the entire course of the experiment, with 
no significant effect on weight or any other outward signs of morbidity. Treatment with ARRY-438162 
resulted in dose dependent inhibition of the growth of subcutaneous Colo-205 tumors. On day 12, the 
time of maximum tumor growth inhibition in the 30 mg/kg group, 7/7 mice had tumor regressions of 
greater than 50%. On day 19, the average tumor growth inhibition was 33% at 3 mg/kg, 59% at 10 
mg/kg and 85% at 30 mg/kg. There were three partial responses (>50% tumor growth inhibition) and 
one complete response on day 19 at 30 mg/kg. 
Exploratory (non-GLP) study evaluating the effect of the triple combination 
MEK162/LGX818/cetuximab on growth on CRC563 human CRC (BRAF V600E) patient-derived 
xenografts in NCr NU/Nu mice (Study 060304-1678) 
This study examined the growth characteristics and tolerability following treatment with a MEK inhibitor 
(MEK162), a RAF inhibitor (LGX818) and an anti-EGFR antibody (cetuximab) as single agents and in 
combination in immunocompromised mice with CRC562 (BRAF V600E) tumor fragments.  
Animals were dosed with vehicle, MEK at 3.5 mg/kg twice daily by oral gavage, 20 mg/kg LGX818 once 
daily by oral gavage or 20 mg/kg twice weekly by intraperitoneal injection as single agent or in 
combination for 21 days. Cetuximab was administered intraperitoneal at a dose of 20 mg/kg.  
All treatments were tolerated with a maximum body weight loss of about 19% in the vehicle control 
group. One animal in the LGX818 single agent group was sacrificed after the dosing period due to body 
weight loss which is thought to be the result of the tumor itself. The cetuximab, LGX818 and 
LGX818/cetuximab group had less than 50% tumor growth inhibition (%TGI) with 0%, 45% and 43%, 
respectively. The MEK162, MEK162/cetuximab and the MEK162/LGX818 groups had similar %TGI with 
68%, 59% and 58%, respectively. The triple combination of MEK162/LGX818/cetuximab was the most 
efficacious with 75% tumor growth inhibition.

Exploratory (non-GLP) study evaluating the anti-tumor effect of the triple combination 
MEK162/LGX818/cetuximab on growth of CRC769 human CRC (BRAF600E) patient-derived 
xenografts in NCr NU/Nu mice (Study 060304-1681) 
The purpose of this study was to examine the growth characteristics and tolerability following treatment 
with a MEK inhibitor (MEK162), a RAF inhibitor (LGX818) and an anti-EGFR antibody (cetuximab) as 
single agents and in combination in immunocompromised mice with CRC769 (BRAFV600E) tumor 
fragments, a human colon PDX. 
Animals were dosed with vehicle, MEK at 3.5 mg/kg twice daily by oral gavage, 20 mg/kg LGX818 once 
daily by oral gavage or 20 mg/kg twice weekly by intraperitoneal injection as single agent or in 
combination for 21 days. Cetuximab was administered twice weekly for 3 weeks intraperitoneal at a dose 
of 20 mg/kg on days 1, 5, 8, 12, 15 and 18. 
All treatments were tolerated with a maximum body weight loss of about 8%. One animal was found dead 
in the LGX818/cetuximab group; but it is thought not to be treatment related but possibly due to body 
weight loss as an adverse event of the tumor itself. Cetuximab administered as a single agent was not 
effective. The cetuximab, MEK162 and MEK162/cetuximab groups had less than 50% tumor growth 
inhibition (%TGI) with 0%, 43% and 55%, respectively. The LGX818 and LGX818/cetuximab groups had 
similar %TGI with 56% and 55%, respectively. The most efficacious groups were MEK162/LGX818 (75% 
TGI, 24% regression) and the triple combination of MEK162/LGX818/cetuximab (80% TGI, 46% 
regression).

Anti-tumor effects of triple combination of LGX818/MEK162/cetuximab in HT-29 CRC model 
(Study RD-2013-50350) 
This study evaluated the effects of LGX818, MEK162 and Cetuximab as single agents and in combinations 
in the BRAF V600E mutant HT-29 colorectal cancer (CRC) xenograft tumor model in mice. 
Animals were dosed with vehicle, MEK at 3.5 mg/kg twice daily by oral gavage, 20 mg/kg LGX818 once 
daily by oral gavage or 20 mg/kg twice weekly by intraperitoneal injection as single agent or in 
combination for 21 days. Cetuximab was administered twice weekly for 3 weeks intraperitoneal at a dose 
of 20 mg/kg. After the last dose of treatment tumors were monitored for three more weeks. 
All treatments were tolerated with maximum body weight loss as -7.7%. Cetuximab administered as a 
single agent was not effective. LGX818 at 20 mg/kg, MEK162 at 3.5 mg/kg and Cetuximab at 20 mg/kg 
produced statistically non-significant anti-tumor effects with tumor volume change (T/C) of 42%, 28%, 
and 95% respectively. LGX818 in combination with MEK162 resulted in T/C 22% (p>0.05 vs vehicle 
treated group); LGX818 in combination with Cetuximab resulted in T/C 6% (p<0.05 vs vehicle or 
Cetuximab treated groups); MEK162 in combination with Cetuximab resulted in T/C 5% (p<0.05 vs 
vehicle or Cetuximab treated groups). The triple combination of LGX818 + MEK162 + Cetuximab led to 
tumor regression with T/T0 -14%. The triple combination treatment is statistically significant (p<0.05), 
when compared with vehicle, LGX818 or Cetuximab monotherapy. However, it not statistically significant 
when compared with MEK162 monotherapy, LGX818 + MEK162 or MEK162 + Cetuximab treated groups 
(see table 3). 
After termination of treatment, tumors resumed growth in all the treatment groups, which suggests that 
continuous treatment is necessary to achieve sustained antitumor efficacy.

Fig. 3: Tumor growth curve in HT29 xenograft model following 21 days of LGX818, MEK162, and 
cetuximab as single agents or in combinations 
It was clarified that not all animals reached a tumor volume of approx. 220 mm3 that was considered a 
requirement for the study. Therefore, only a reduced number of animals were used (9 instead of 10).

Dose and Schedule Dependence of LGX818-NX Activity and Response to in the COLO 205 
Human Colorectal Adenocarcinoma Nude Mouse Xenograft Model (Study Colo205-e293) 
(updated) 
One purpose of this study was to determine the dose and schedule dependence of LGX818-NX activity in 
the subcutaneous COLO 205 human colorectal adenocarcinoma nude mouse xenograft model. 
LGX818-NX was administered orally for four weeks at three dose intensities: 5, 25, and 150 mg/kg twice 
daily (bid x 28) and 10, 50, and 300 mg/kg once daily (qd x28). Control mice received the LGX818-NX 
vehicle, and a reference group received a standard preclinical paclitaxel regimen (30 mg/kg, i.v. once 
daily on alternate days for five days (pod x 5)).

Twice daily LGX818-NX at 5, 25, and 150 mg/kg produced –12%, –48%, and –50% T/T0 and extended 
median survival by 51%, 118% and 76%, respectively. Once daily 10, 50, and 300 mg/kg doses 
produced –25%, –35%, and –56% T/T0 and extended median survival by 58%, 80%, and 121%, 
respectively. At each dose intensity, there were no significant advantages to BID versus QD dosing 
(Kruskal- Wallis analysis and post hoc Dunn’s multiple comparison test). Enhanced anti-tumour activity

was seen at the 50 mg/kg/day dose level compared to the 10 mg/kg/day dose level, but there was no 
consistent improvement at 300 mg/kg/day. Encorafenib was well tolerated at all dose levels and 
schedules with no significant body weight loss noted; a transient, 4.3%, decrease in body weight was 
seen at the 300 mg/kg/day dose level on Day 7. No other signs of toxicity or mortality were observed. 
Interactions of and with LGX818-NX in the HT-29 Human Colorectal Adenocarcinoma Nude 
Mouse Xenograft Model (Study HT29-e375) (Updated) 
The study assessed the interactions of LGX818-NX with the HCl salt of a pan-PI3K inhibitor AA (LR27-AA) 
in the HT-29 human colorectal adenocarcinoma nude mouse xenograft model. 
LGX818-NX was tested at two dose levels (5 and 50 mg/kg), and the PI3K inhibitor was tested at one 
dose level (32.7 mg/kg; equivalent to 30 mg/kg free base), on a daily oral treatment schedule for 28 
days. Agents were tested individually and in four dual therapies that delivered the PI3K inhibitor within 1 
h after LGX818-NX. Control mice received the vehicles for LGX818-NX (Vehicle 1; 0.5% carboxymethyl 
cellulose : 0.5% Tween 80 : 99% deionized water) and the PI3K inhibitor AA (Vehicle 2; 10% N-
methylpyrrolidone : 90% polyethylene glycol 300). Paclitaxel as reference was omitted because the 
tumor engraftment rate was lower than anticipated.

Encorafenib was well tolerated at all dose levels and schedules with no significant body weight loss noted. 
No other signs of toxicity or mortality were observed. Tumors progressed satisfactorily in vehicle-treated 
Group 1 mice but LGX818-NX monotherapies at 5 and 50 mg/kg qd x 28 (Groups 2 and 3) were inactive.  
Further results of this study were as follows: Monotherapy with PI3K inhibitor AA (Group 3) caused non-
significant inhibition and negligible survival extension. LGX818-NX / PI3K inhibitor AA combination 
therapy at the 5:32.7 mg/kg ratio (Group 6) produced 31% T/C and significant (P < 0.05) inhibition, but 
improved non-significantly upon PI3K inhibitor AA monotherapy. LGX818-NX / PI3K inhibitor AA at the 
50:32.7 mg/kg ratio (Group 7) yielded 14% T/C, significant (P < 0.001) inhibition, and significant 
improvements over the 50 mg/kg LGX818-NX (P < 0.01) and PI3K inhibitor AA (P < 0.05) 
monotherapies. The latter two groups caused the largest group mean body weight losses (8% and 6.4%, 
respectively). 
Overall, LGX818-NX / PI3K inhibitor AA at the 5:32.7 and 50:32.7 ratios increased median TTE by 27% 
and 38%, respectively. The combination with the higher LGX818-NX dose yielded a significant survival 
extension (P < 0.05), but a non-significant improvement upon LGX818-NX monotherapy. Notably, during 
the first 1–2 weeks after dosing ended, median and mean tumor volumes increased more slowly in 
Groups 6 and 7 than in any other groups.  
Encorafenib administered as single agent were inactive in this study; only the combination with the PI3K 
inhibitor AA caused significant tumor inhibition in the HT-29 cell line. But, this inhibition does not 
correlate with a sustained survival extension.  
Dose and Schedule Dependence of LGX818-NX Activity and Response to in the LS411N Human 
Colon Carcinoma Nude Mouse Xenograft Model (Study LS411N-e202) (updated) 
This study determined the dose and schedule dependence of LGX818-NX activity in the subcutaneous 
LS411N human colon carcinoma nude mouse xenograft model.  
LGX818-NX was administered orally for four weeks and was tested at three dose intensities (10, 50, and 
300 mg/kg/day), on twice daily and once daily treatment schedules. Control mice received the LGX818-
NX vehicle, and a reference group received a standard preclinical paclitaxel regimen.

LGX818-NX p.o. b.i.d. x 28 at 5, 25, and 150 mg/kg (Groups 2, 4, and 6) produced 56%, 48%, and 34% 
T/C on D28, and extended survival by 36%, 38%, and 49%, respectively. This mean tumor growth during 
the dosing period indicated significant but weakly dose-dependent activity. The short-term and overall 
activities for b.i.d. LGX818-NX were significant at 5 mg/kg (P < 0.05), 25 mg/kg (P < 0.05), and 150 
mg/kg (P < 0.01), respectively. Non-significant short-term and overall effects with LGX818-NX p.o. qd x 
28 at 10, 50, and 300 mg/kg (Groups 3, 5, and 7) indicated that qd dosing was less effective than split 
doses administered twice daily. Statistically significant differences were not demonstrated between b.i.d. 
and qd regimens at the same dose intensity. 
Overall, the BRAF inhibitor LGX818-NX at 5, 25, and 150 mg/kg produced weakly dose-dependent T/C 
and survival extension in the LS411N human colon carcinoma nude mouse xenograft model. At the same 
dose intensities, qd treatments produced non-significant T/C and survival extensions. Comparisons of 
b.i.d. and qd regimens indicated that improvements seen with b.i.d. dosing were not significant. 
The effect on proliferation of combining the RAF inhibitor LGX818 with inhibitors of PI3K, 
EGFR, and cMET in BRAF mutant colorectal-derived cell lines (Study RD-2012-50088)

The study evaluated the effect of combining the RAF inhibitor LGX818 with either EGFR (Erlotinib (NVP-
XBX005-NX-1), c-MET (NVP-INC280-AA), or PIK3Cα (BYL719-NX-11) inhibitors in a panel of 9 BRAF-

All cell lines tested were insensitive to erlotinib as a single agent. In contrast 6/9 cell lines were sensitive 
to encorafenib as a single agent, displaying IC50 values below 500 nM (Table 4). The 
encorafenib/erlotinib combination synergistically inhibited the proliferation of 6/9 CRC cell lines (Table 5). 
Two cell lines were not sensitive to the encorafenib/erlotinib combination (MDST8 and OUMS-23). 
The study further evaluated the combination effects of encorafenib (LGX818) with either cetuximab or 
erlotinib in HT-29 and SW 1417 cell lines showing that cetuximab and erlotinib had nearly identical effects 
on proliferation when combined with encorafenib (see figure 3).

Figure 6: Combination Effects of Encorafenib (LGX818) with Either Cetuximab or Erlotinib in 
HT-29 and SW 1417 Cell Lines 
Cell proliferation assay: Eight of the nine cell lines were insensitive to INC280 at concentrations up to 
2700nM. In contrast 6/9 cell lines were sensitive to LGX818 as a single agent, displaying IC50 values 
below 500nM. All cell lines tested were insensitive to Erlotinib. The LGX818/Erlotinib and LGX818/INC280 
combinations synergistically inhibited the proliferation of 6/9 and 2/9 cell lines, respectively. 
Proliferation was also studied with the two mechanistically distinct EGFR inhibitors erlotinib and cetuximab 
in combination with LGX818 in two cell lines (HT-29 and SW 1417). Both inhibitors had nearly identical 
effects on proliferation when combined with LGX818. 
Combining LGX818 with the selective PIK3Cα BYL719 resulted in varying degrees of synergy in cells 
harboring both wt and activating alleles of PIK3Cα.  
The triple combination of LGX818 with BYL719 and an RTK inhibitor exhibited a greater anti-proliferative 
effect compared to any of the pair-wise combination. 
Western blotting: The effects of the inhibitors LGX818 and BYL719 were examined, as single agents, and 
in combination over a 48 hr time period in both the PI3Kα/BRAFV600E double mutant cell line HT-29 and

The triple combination mimicked the BYL719 single agent effects on p-AKT levels (suppression of p-AKT 
without effecting p-EGFR or p-ERK), and the effect of the LGX818/Erlotinib pair on p-ERK levels thereby 
providing robust suppression of both the PIK3Cα and MAPK pathways. When Cetuximab was used in place 
of Erlotinib in similar experiments virtually identical results were obtained (data not shown). Lastly, in 
both cell lines, treatment with LGX818 resulted in a reduction in the levels of total, but not 
phosphorylated, EGFR, particularly at the 24 and 48 time-points. 
Overall, the sponsor concluded that the synergistic and greater overall effects observed for the triple 
combination likely resulted from the simultaneous suppression of both MAPK and PIK3Cα signaling. 
Thereby, it was concluded that the concept of combining the RAF inhibitor LGX818 with the EGFR inhibitor 
Cetuximab might support clinical application for the treatment of BRAFV600E tumors. 
2.2.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment  
Updated ERAs have been provided for Braftovi and Mektovi to consider a type II variation to extend the 
indication of encorafenib/binimetinib in combination with binimetinib/encorafenib and cetuximab for the 
treatment of adult patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) with a BRAF V600E mutation, who 
have received prior systemic therapy. 
New ERAs are based on the ERAs of the initial marketing authorisation, which at that time had been 
considered complete and acceptable. No new experimental studies were provided for the present 
worksharing application but new initial PECsurfacewater values were calculated to be 0.0514 µg/l for Braftovi 
and 0.45 µg/l for Mektovi, respectively. Updated PEC/PNEC calculations showed that a risk to the aquatic 
and sediment compartment is not indicated. Assessments of the risk to the terrestrial compartment is 
considered not necessary.

However, both active substances have to be classified as very persistent (vP) in water/sediment systems 
as encorafenib showed a half-life (DT50) of 1000 days in sediment at 20 °C and DT50 of 203.7 - 468.6 
days in the total system at 20 °C. Further, a transformation product of binimetinib formed in water – 
sediment systems shows a half-life (DT50) of 295 d (normalized to 12°C as average temperature in the 
EU).

2.2.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In order to support the new indication, previous data from in vitro and in vivo studies with encorafenib in 
combination with cetuximab and encorafenib as single agent have been re-analysed with the focus on the 
doublet combination.  
In vivo studies where encorafenib was used as single agent were performed with three different BRAF 
mutant xenograft models. Different dose regimes and schedules were tested in the LS411N model 
showing that all dose regimens resulted in tumor growth inhibition and extended survival with weakly 
dose-dependency. Statistically significant differences could not be demonstrated between b.i.d. and qd 
regimens at the same dose intensity.  
Encorafenib was further tested in the HT-29 human colorectal tumor nude mouse xenograft model. Two 
dose levels (5 and 50 mg/kg) were used, on a daily oral treatment schedule for 28 days and both dose 
levels  were  shown  to  be  inactive.  This  is  in  contrast  to  the  results  of  study  RD-2013-50350,  where 
encorafenib was active (T/C 42% after administration of 20 mg/kg qd). 
The effect of encorafenib on the COLO 205 human colorectal adenocarcinoma nude mouse xenograft 
model was evaluated. Twice daily LGX818-NX at 5, 25, and 150 mg/kg once daily 10, 50, and 300 mg 
caused tumor reduction and extended survival. There were no significant advantages to b.i.d. versus qd 
dosing similar to the results obtained with the LS411N model.   
Within the xenograft models in which encorafenib was used in combination with cetuximab, a statistically 
significant effect of the combination enco/cetuxi on tumor growth was only in the HT-29 model. In both, 
the CRC563 and CRC769 models, an effect of combination could not be shown. Remarkable is the fact 
that cetuximab as single agent had no (CRC563, CRC769) respective, only a small effect on tumor 
growth (HT-29). 
Administration of encorafenib plus erlotinib (as anti EGFR drug) in in vitro studies using different BRAF 
mutant cell lines resulted in synergistical inhibition of the proliferation of 6/9 CRC cell lines. Interestingly, 
all cell lines tested were insensitive to erlotinib as single agent similar to cetuximab as single agent in 
most of the xenograft models. Further in vitro studies evaluated the combination effects of encorafenib 
(LGX818) with either cetuximab or erlotinib in two cell lines: PI3Kα/BRAFV600E double mutant HT-29 
and BRAFV600E single mutant SW 1417. Both anti-EGFR drugs had nearly identical effects on

Page 30/224 
 
 
  
  
 
proliferation when combined with encorafenib. This is remarkable since HT-29 belongs to the BM2 
subgroup of BRAF V600E mutant CRCs and SW1417 to the BM1 subgroup, indicating that there might be 
no difference in behaviour between the subgroups with respect to EGFR- together with BRAF-inhibition. 
Western blots analysis showed that encorafenib reduced the levels of total, but not phosphorylated, 
EGFR, particularly at the 24 and 48 time-points in both the HT-29 and SW 1417 cell lines. Combining 
encorafenib with erlotinib resulted in a markedly better suppression of p-ERK levels than was 
accomplished by either inhibitor alone. Cetuximab behaved within this study equivalently to Erlotinib 
when combined with LGX818.  
Administration of encorafenib as single agent in in vivo xenograft models resulted in tumor regression 
and extended survival independent of dose regimens and schedules (qd or bid). The combination of 
encorafenib and cetuximab led only in the HT-29 xenograft model to a significant effect on tumor growth. 
The HT-29 cell line was also the only one where cetuximab as single agent resulted in a distinct effect. 
Cetuximab as single agent had no effect in all other in vivo models. The HT-29 model was also part of the 
encorafenib evaluation in in vitro studies. Within these studies, the enco/cetuxi combination resulted in 
distinct tumor regression, similar to the xenograft models. 
Overall, the preclinical data do not provide convincing evidence that the addition of cetuximab led to a 
superior effect in the treatment of CRC. In view of the fact that the data provided, rather, clearly 
demonstrate that cetuximab is ineffective in the models investigated, the submitted rationale for the 
clinical use of the double or triple combination is questionable. The non-clinical rationale for the addition 
of cetuximab to encorafenib in BRAFmut/RASwt models (preferably human colorectal carcinomas) is 
currently lacking. 
2.2.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Several studies with the combination of encorafenib, binimetinib and cetuximab were performed in 
different CRC cell lines to underline that the combination of encorafenib plus cetuximab had a positive 
impact on the new indication. The results however demonstrated   
1.  Cetuximab as single agent was inactive in the used models 
2.  Efficacious groups in the CRC tumor cell lines were the MEK162/LGX818 groups either as 
monotherapy or in combination with each other. The combination of LGX818 plus cetuximab or 
MEK162 plus cetuximab did not increase the efficacy of the single agents.  
3.  The results suggest that cetuximab was not only inactive as single agent but also in combination.  
Therefore, from a preclinical point of view, the proposed positive influence of cetuximab through inhibition 
of the EGFR cannot be concluded from the results obtained.  
Based on the updated data submitted in this application, the new/extended indication does not lead to a 
significant increase in environmental exposure further to the use of binimetinib nor encorafenib.  
Considering the above data, binimetinib and encorafenib are not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment. 
Considering the above data, binimetinib and encorafenib should be used according to the precautions 
stated in the SmPC in order to minimise any potential risks to the environment.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the WSA. 
The WSA has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
Two new clinical studies support the new application in mCRC, the Phase Ib/II study CLGX818X2103 and 
the pivotal Phase III study ARRAY-818-302 (BEACON) and 2 new population PK and/or exposure response 
(ER) analyses are provided in support of this application (Reports CP19-013 and T2019-00141).

Three validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based BA methods 
using stable label internal standards were used to support clinical development in mCRC and were also 
used to support the initial MAA. All 3 methods for binimetinib and its metabolite AR00426032 in plasma 
had an LLOQ of 1 ng/mL.  
Method Bini-A (Method 12BAS0106, and amendment 01) was described in the initial MAA. Amendment 02 
was an extension of long-term stability in plasma to 56 months (1687 days) at -70°C for both 
compounds. Amendment 03 was a change of sponsor from Novartis to Array BioPharma Inc. and some 
wording of the long-term storage stability section. All PK samples generated in study ARRAY-818-302 
were analysed using method Bini-A. 
Method Bini-B (PPD method AKCN2 and AKCN2 addendum 01) and Method Bini-C (QPS method 234-703) 
support whole blood stability on an ice bath and non-refrigerated centrifuge, and were cited in report 
17BAS0309, i.e. the ARRAY-818-302 BA report describing clinical sample analysis. 
Binimetinib and AR00426032 in plasma were demonstrated to be stable for up to 68 months when stored 
below -20°C and up to 56 months when stored at -70°C. In human whole blood, binimetinib and 
AR00426032 were demonstrated to be stable at 4°C for up to 45 min.

The bioanalytical method used to quantify cetuximab in combination with binimetinib and encorafenib for 
ARRAY-818-302 was an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), developed and validated 
in human serum by WuXi AppTec. 
The method is based on the Cetuximab present in calibration standard curve and sample controls bound 
to EGFR which is coated on the surface of the plate, and then use a primary Ab (mouse anti-Cetuximab 
mAb) to bind to the Cetuximab which had bounded to the EGFR. Finally, the bound mouse anti-Cetuximab 
mAb is then detected by adding a goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase 
(The bound Cetuximab is detected indirectly at the same time). After addition of TMB working solution, 
the peroxidase on detection antibody will generate OD signals. As stopped by sulfuric acid, the resulting 
OD signal is directly proportional to the amount of bound Cetuximab by measured with the plate reader at 
450 nm (reference wavelength 620 nm). 
The linearity of the analytical method (4-parameter logistic regression) for analysis of cetuximab in serum 
was validated in the range of 40 to 4000 ng/mL (report 15BAS0095 and amendment 01). The method 
demonstrated specificity in serum plasma with no significant interferences observed in the biological 
matrix. The inter-day accuracy and precision of the method were evaluated as the mean bias and 
precision of quality control (QC) samples analysed during 6 validation days. The bias and the precision at 
the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) were 2.1% and 5.6%, respectively. The bias and the precision at 
the upper limit of quantitation (ULOQ) were -5.6% and 12.1%, respectively. Between the LLOQ and the 
ULOQ, the biases were within the range of -0.3% to 2.1% and the precisions were within the range of 
7.7% to 9.1%. Accuracy of dilution was demonstrated for 160-fold dilution. 
Cetuximab in serum was stable for up to 42 months when stored below -70°C or at -20°C, and was stable 
for up to 8 days when stored at room temperature or at 4°C. Cetuximab in human serum was stable for 
up to 6 freeze/thaw cycles at both -20±5°C and -70±10°C. Incurred sample reproducibility of 
quantitation has been demonstrated for cetuximab in serum samples from patient population collected 
during the oncology study used to support treatment in mCRC. 
•  Molecular screening 
Patients were eligible for the study based on identification of a BRAFV600E mutation in the tumour as 
determined by the central laboratory as part of Molecular Prescreening for the trial or by a local assay 
result obtained any time prior to Screening. Only polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and next generation 
sequencing (NGS)-based local assays results were acceptable. If the patient was enrolled based on local 
assay results, the BRAF mutation status must have been confirmed by the central laboratory no later than 
30 days from first dose of study treatment. 
Central testing has been performed in central labs complying with international in vitro diagnostic quality 
standards. The analytical performance and clinical validity of BRAF central testing method with a Qiagen-
developed real-time PCR BRAF V600E clinical trial assay developed for this study was detailed, as well the

Pharmacokinetic sampling 
In Phase Ib/II Study CLGX818X2103 rich serial PK samples (predose, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 hours 
post dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 and C2D1) were collected to estimate PK parameters for the Doublet 
combination of encorafenib + cetuximab. Samples were collected from all patients in the dose-escalation 
phase and in the first 10 patients in the Phase 2 portion of the study; the remainder of patients on the 
Phase 2 portion of the study had sparse PK sampling (predose, and between 0.5 to 2, 2 to 4 and 4 to 10 
hours on C1D1 and C2D1). Planned predose PK samples were also collected on C3D1 through C10D1 in 
both the dose escalation portion and the Phase 2 portion of the study. A complete treatment cycle was 
defined as 28 days. 
Only encorafenib was analysed in the Doublet portion of the study and no PK samples for cetuximab 
analysis were collected in this study. 
In phase III study ARRAY-818-302 (BEACON) PK sampling in the Safety Lead-In (SLI) portion was 
performed according to the following scheme: 
PK sampling in the randomized phase 3 portion was performed as follows:

Pharmacokinetic and statistical data analysis 
PK parameters were determined using non-compartmental (NCA) methods, based on individual 
plasma/serum concentration-time data. In addition, the metabolite to parent exposure ratios were 
calculated on C1D1 and C2D1 for AR00426032, while the accumulation ratios were calculated for all 
analytes on C2D1. 
PK samples collected outside the allowed time windows were flagged in the concentration data listings 
and excluded from all associated tables and mean figures, but retained in the individual concentration-
time plots and estimation of PK parameters. 
Concentration data was summarized at each nominal time point with the following descriptive statistics: 
n, Mean, SD, CV%, Median, Min, Max, GeoMean, and GeoCV%. 
Common PK and statistical analysis methods were applied.  
Population PK models 
PopPK report T2019-00141 
Population PK and exposure-response analyses were performed based on five clinical studies in healthy 
subjects, patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600 mutant melanoma and patients with BRAF 
V600E-mutant mCRC from the following clinical trials: 
Patients with BRAF V600E-mutant mCRC 
-  Study  BEACON  (ARRAY-818-302):  triple  combi  (binimetinib/encorafenib/cetuximab)  or  dual  combi 
(encorafenib/cetuximab or irinotecan/cetuximab or folfiri/cetuximab) 
-  Study CLGX818X2103: dual combi (encorafenib/cetuximab) 
Patients with BRAF V600 mutant advanced solid tumors 
-  Study CMEK162X2110: dual combi (binimetinib/encorafenib) 
-  Study CLGX818X2101: single agent encorafenib 
Healthy subjects 
-  Study ARRAY-162-105 single agent binimetinib or encorafenib 
Doses used were:  
-  Binimetinib: 45 mg BID,  
- 
Encorafenib: 50, 100, 300, 450, 600 or 900 mg QD,  
-  Cetuximab: 250 or 400 mg/m2  
Given that PK data from patients with mCRC in studies ARRAY-818-302 and CLGX818X2103 are limited or 
sparse sampling data, rich sampling data of encorafenib and binimetinib from healthy subjects (ARRAY-
162-105) were included into the full dataset. In addition, data from studies CMEK162X2110 and 
CLGX818X2101 were used to document the analysis in patients with rich sampling data, to bring 
information about dose and time dependent PK of encorafenib and evaluate differences between patients 
with melanoma and with mCRC. 
Concentration-time profiles of encorafenib and binimetinib were previously modeled based on PK data 
collected in five clinical trials. The final population PK model of encorafenib consisted of a two-
compartment model with a first order absorption rate, a lag-time and a time-varying clearance to account 
for enzymatic auto-induction. The final population PK model of binimetinib consisted of a two-
compartment model with linear elimination with a zero-order rate of absorption and a lag time. Relevant 
covariates were included such as body weight, age, and concomitant administration of CYP3A inhibitors. 
Those structural population PK models were the starting point to characterize the PK profiles of

encorafenib and binimetinib in patients with mCRC in BEACON and CLGX818X2103 studies (for 
encorafenib only). Models were refined to optimize the quality of fit. 
A population PK model of cetuximab was previously developed based on 1,253 concentration samples 
collected in 96 patients with confirmed stage IV colorectal adenocarcinoma with unresectable metastases. 
Cetuximab PK profiles were best described by a two-compartment model with combined first- and zero-
order elimination processes. Albumin and BSA were identified as predictors of volume and elimination 
processes. The structural model was used as a starting point to develop a population PK model with the 
PK data of cetuximab collected in patients with mCRC in BEACON and CLGX818X2103 studies. 
•  Encorafenib 
The final population PK model of encorafenib consisted of a two-compartment model with a first order 
absorption rate, a lag-time and a time-varying clearance to account for enzymatic auto-induction. Time-
dependent clearance is expressed with a sigmoid function with a maximum time effect (Emax) and time 
to reach 50% of Emax (T50). Those structural population PK models were the starting point to 
characterize the PK profiles of encorafenib and binimetinib in patients with mCRC in BEACON and 
CLGX818X2103 studies (for encorafenib only). Models were refined to optimize the quality of fit. A total of 
394 subjects received encorafenib either as monotherapy (ARRAY-162-105 and CLGX818X2101), in 
combination only with binimetinib (CMEK162X2110), in combination with cetuximab and in combination 
with binimetinib and cetuximab (BEACON). A total of 236 (59.9%) patients had BRAF V600E-mutant with 
mCRC and 96 (24.4%) patients had melanoma with a BRAF V600 mutation. Oral encorafenib dose levels 
varied from 25 to 900 mg with single dose administration, or repeated QD or BID administrations.  
The previous structural model of encorafenib was re-evaluated with the dataset updated with PK data 
collected in BEACON and CLGX818X2103 studies. Of a total of 4348 samples, 43 (<1%) were excluded 
from the analysis (outliers, measurable concentrations before the 1st dose and during unscheduled visit). 
Additional structural models were evaluated by adding BSV on lag time of absorption (ALAG) (Enco2), 
BSV on ALAG, Emax and T50 (refer to Enco3) and BSV on ALAG, CL/2 and V2/F (Enco3), but important 
shrinkage was obtained on most PK parameters (i.e., >30%). The model was re-estimated without log-
transformation on concentrations (model Enco5) and with a 3rd compartment but no improvement in 
goodness-of-fit was observed. The previous model with BSV on Ka, CL/F and V/F with time-dependent 
effect on CL/F was found to better describe the data (Enco01). Shrinkages of PK parameters were low 
(24.7% for ka, 16.3& for Vc/F and 14.8% for Cl/F). 
Baseline characteristics of encorafenib patients is shown in table 1.

Sources of variability were explored to visually assess the effect of continuous and categorical covariates 
on PK parameters of encorafenib. Based upon a full model approach, the final model included the 
following covariates  
-  Ka: age as a continuous covariate 
-  CL/F:  disease  status  (mCRC  patients  vs  patients  with  melanoma  vs  patients  with  other  tumors  vs 
healthy subjects), ECOG status (1 and 2), CYP3A4 inhibitors (strong (not significant based on 95% 
CI)  and  moderate),  renal  function  (mild  and  moderate,  not  significant  based  on  95%  CI)  as 
categorical covariates, and AST (not significant based on 95% CI), TPROT, BIL, LDH, age and body 
weight as continuous covariates 
- 
Emax: dose 
-  V/F: age as a continuous covariate (not significant based on 95% CI) 
All PK parameters were estimated with a good precision with RSE varying from 1.5% to 41.2%. Based on 
the 95% CI, the effects of AST, renal impairment and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors on CL/F and the effect of 
age on V/F were not statistically significant (i.e., 95% CI included the null hypothesis). All other 
covariates included in the final population PK model have significant effects on the PK behavior of 
encorafenib, being age on ka, disease status, ECOG status, moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, TPROT, BIL, 
LDH, age and bw on CL, dose on Emax.

In terms of categorical covariates, medians and 95% CI of the following covariate effects on AUCss and 
Cmaxss were within 80% and 125% relative to the reference patient: ECOG (1 vs 0), disease status 
and/or tumor type (mCRC vs no tumor vs melanoma) and renal function (mild vs normal). Lower limits of 
95% CI of ECOG 2 effect were less than 80% for the relative changes in AUCss and Cmaxss with medians 
within 80%-125%. Upper limits of 95% CI of the effects of moderate renal impairment function, of other 
tumor types and of co-administration of moderate CYP inhibitor were higher than 125%, although all 
medians were within 80% - 125%.  
In terms of continuous covariates, upper limits of 95% CI of BIL and LDH effects were higher than 125% 
for the relative changes of AUCss and Cmaxss, assuming high levels of BIL (i.e., 1.16 mg/dL) and of LDH 
(i.e., 557 U/L). Similarly, upper limit of 95% CI of WT effect on AUCss was higher than 125% for a WT of 
48 kg. Medians and 95% CI of TPROT and AST on AUCss and Cmaxss were within 80% and 125% relative 
to the reference patient. For forest plots for AUCss please refer to section on special populations. 
The covariates included in this new analysis are similar to the covariates included in the improved model 
of encorafenib (CP19-016/T2019-00140)9 and the previous ones (CP17-004 and CP17-004A1)8,10 
except for the age which was included in the previous improved model CP19-016/T2019-00140)9 as a 
covariate on Ka and V/F and for the CRCL covariate which is included in the current model as a

categorical covariate rather than a continuous one. Impacts of the current covariates on PK parameters 
are similar to and no more impactful as shown in the previous models. 
The auto-induction of clearance had the following impact: After a single dose, the population estimates of 
CL/F for encorafenib was 16.4 L/h for patients with melanoma and 14.2 L/h for patients with mCRC. 
Based on the population PK model, half-life values associated with the distribution (t1/2α) and elimination 
(t1/2ß) phases of encorafenib after a single dose in patients with mCRC were 0.754 and 21.2 h, 
respectively. The population estimate of CL/F was 1.70-fold higher after several days of dosing due to the 
enzymatic auto-induction of encorafenib, resulting in t1/2α and t1/2ß values of 0.297 and 19.9 h, 
respectively. The estimated time to achieve 50% of the maximum CL/F (T50) is 67.3 h after the 1st dose, 
which leads to a 90% of the maximal effect at 605.7 h (25 days ~3 weeks). This is also consistent with 
the physiological mechanism of enzymatic induction. To adequately characterize the magnitude and time-
dependent effects of enzyme auto-induction after multiple doses of encorafenib, the Emax for the auto-
induction on CL/F showed an increase with encorafenib that was both dose- and time-dependent, 
consistent with concentration effect in the induction physiology. For example, with a dose of 300 mg, the 
CL/F at steady-state condition would be 1.70-fold higher than after a single dose, whereas with a dose of 
450 mg, the CL/F at steady-state would be 1.87-fold higher than after a single dose. 
Final population PK models were used to derive rich concentration-time profiles and exposure parameters 
were derived according to the randomized dose in patients enrolled in all studies. 
Simulations were derived based on steady-state conditions. Mean and median AUCss of encorafenib at 
300 mg and 450 mg QD were similar to those predicted in COLUMBUS study at steady-state after 
repeated administration of combination encorafenib + binimetinib9 (mean and median AUCss were 7.96 
μg.h/mL and 7.37 μg.h/mL at 300 mg QD and 10.2 μg.h/mL and 9.70 μg.h/mL at 450 mg QD, 
respectively) as well as mean and median Cmaxss (1847 ng/mL and 1827 ng/mL at 300 mg QD and 2549 
ng/mL and 2544 ng/mL at 450 mg QD, respectively), and mean and median Cminss (22 ng/mL and 9.02 
ng/mL at 300 mg QD and 17.0 ng/mL and 10.4 ng/mL at 450 mg QD, respectively). Same conclusions 
can be drawn comparing with exposure metrics predicted at steady-state after repeated administration of 
encorafenib monotherapy. Although the two effects are confounded, this suggests no clear difference 
between the two types of tumors and between combinations cetuximab + encorafenib + binimetinib and 
encorafenib + binimetinib. 
•  Binimetinib 
In a first model, based on six clinical trials (ARRAY 162-111, CMEK162X2201, CMEK162X1101 
CMEK162X2101J, CMEK162A2301 and ARRAY 162-0602) binimetinib PK was described with a two-
compartment model with first order absorption and a lag time. Covariates on clearance were moderate 
and mild renal impairment, patient status (HV/patient), total bilirubin, sex and age. This model had been 
updated including additional studies ARRAY 162-205, CMAK162X2110, CMEKB2301, CLGX818 and 
CLGX2109. In this updated model the absorption component was changed to a zero-order rate of 
absorption with lag time. As covariates on clearance similar to the previous analysis, bilirubin and sex 
were significant but not renal impairment, age and patient status. Instead, body weight and albumin 
showed significant effects on clearance additionally. On volume of distribution body weight, albumin and 
patient status were significant covariates. This structural population PK model was the starting point to 
characterize the PK profile of binimetinib in patients with mCRC in BEACON study.  
In the current popPK analysis for binimetinib, data from the following studies were included: ARRAY818-
302 (BEACON), CMEK162X2110 and ARRAY -162-105. A total of 181 subjects received binimetinib either 
as monotherapy in ARRAY-162-105, in combination only with encorafenib in CMEK162X2110 study, in 
combination with encorafenib and cetuximab in BEACON study. A total of 93 (51.4%) patients had BRAF 
V600E-mutant with mCRC from BEACON study and 73 (40.3%) patients had melanoma with a BRAF V600

mutation from Study CMEK162X2110. With the exception of the single dose in healthy subjects (N=15) in 
Study ARRAY-162-105, binimetinib was orally administered BID at 45 mg. A total of 11 PK samples were 
excluded from the analysis due to unscheduled visit and measurable concentrations before the 1st dose. 
The model was refined in a first step by excluding BSV on peripheral PK parameters due to the high 
shrinkage (i.e., >30%) including the effect of body weight on CL/F (Bini02). The structural model resulted 
in adequate goodness-of-fit, and overall the predictive power of the model was deemed adequate to 
evaluate the relations between PK parameters and covariates. 
All PK parameters were estimated with a good precision, with RSE varying from 4.32% to 39.3%, at the 
exception of AST effect on CL/F with RSE of 85.9%. Based on the 95% CI, effects of AST, renal 
impairment and tumor type (mCRC vs melanoma) on CL/F and effect of tumor type (mCRC vs melanoma) 
on V/F were not statistically significant (i.e., 95% CI included the null hypothesis). Thus, the final model 
included the following covariates  
CL/F: disease status (mCRC patients vs patients with melanoma vs healthy subjects), and renal function 
as categorical covariates, and age, body weight, AST, bilirubin as continuous covariates 
V/F: disease status (mCRC patients vs patients with melanoma vs healthy subjects) as categorical and 
body weight as continuous covariates 
The full model with the covariate effect was refined by re-evaluating the model using different initial 
values for V/F, by testing with first-order rate of absorption instead of zero order rate of absorption and 
by optimizing the OMEGA matrix. The model with Ka and correlation between CL/F and V/F was found to 
better describe the data (Full7). 
Goodness-of-fit of the final population PK model of binimetinib is presented in Figure 6.

Forest plots for AUCss can be found in section on special populations. 
In terms of categorical covariates, medians and 95% CI of renal function (moderate vs mild vs normal) 
and tumor type (mCRC vs melanoma) were within 80% and 125% relative to the reference patient. 
Healthy subjects would have significantly lower exposures comparing to reference with point estimates 
lower than 80% (i.e., point estimate equal to 76% for AUCss and 53% for Cmaxss). 
In terms of continuous covariates, medians and 95% CI of the following covariate effects on AUCss and 
Cmaxss were within 80% and 125% relative to the reference patient: age, AST and BIL. Exposures of 
binimetinib (AUCss an Cmaxss) would significantly change with the body weight range included in 
BEACON study (i.e., 48.4 – 99.5 kg) with magnitude of effect greater than 20%; patients of 48.4 kg 
would have 29% and 33% higher AUCss and Cmaxss respectively relative to the reference patient 
whereas for patients of 99.5 kg, only Cmaxss of binimetinib is significantly affected with a point estimate 
of 0.785 for lower Cmaxss relative to the reference patient. However the 95%CI of these estimates are 
inclusive of the 80% - 125%, suggesting a lack of clinical significance. In addition no trends were 
observed in individual PK parameters (CL/F, V/F and Ka) regarding the race/ethnic covariates. 
The covariates included in this new binimetinib population PK analysis are similar to the covariates 
included in the previous ones (CP17-004, CP17-004A1 and CP16-001) except for the albumin which was 
included on CL/F and V/F in the previous model, age also included on V/F in the previous model and AST 
on CL/F included in the current model. These modifications are deemed minor as they show low impact 
on PK parameters. In addition, the magnitude of the current covariates on PK parameters is close and not 
more impactful as in the previous model.

The final population PK model was used to derive rich concentration-time profiles and exposure 
parameters were derived according to the randomized dose in patients enrolled in all studies. Simulations 
were derived based on steady-state conditions.  
In the current analysis, lower Cmaxss and Cminss were observed. In the previous analysis, mean and 
median of Cmaxss were 692 ng/mL and 677 ng/mL, respectively and mean and median of Cminss were 
38.3 ng/mL and 36.0 ng/mL, respectively. Higher predicted Cmaxss in the previous analysis (i.e., ~63% 
higher than the current analysis) may be explained by the structure of the absorption model which was a 
zero-order rate of absorption.

•  Cetuximab 
A population PK analysis was performed on cetuximab concentration data in order to evaluate any effect 
of encorafenib and binimetinib on cetuximab PK profiles and to provide predicted individual exposures for 
exposure-response analyses. A total of 261 patients with mCRC received intravenous (IV) administration 
of cetuximab in control, in doublet and triplet arms in BEACON study. In control groups, cetuximab was 
administered with irinotecan or Folfiri (folinic acid, fluorouracil and irinotecan), in doublet with 300 mg QD 
of encorafenib and in triplet with 300 mg QD of encorafenib and 45 mg BID of binimetinib. Initial IV 
administration of cetuximab was a 120-min IV infusion of 400 mg/m2 followed by 60-minute IV infusion 
of 250 mg/m2 once weekly. 
The PK population included 136 (52.1%) male and 125 (47.2%) female patients, mainly of White origin 
(83.1%). Over the 261, 99 (37.9%) patients were treated with cetuximab in control arms, 69 (26.4%) 
patients were treated with cetuximab combined with encorafenib and 93 (35.6%) were treated with the 
triplet therapy of cetuximab combined to encorafenib and binimetinib. Amongst patients in BEACON 
study, 116 (44.4%) had a fully active life (i.e., ECOG score of 0) and 145 (55.6%) patients had a 
restricted physical activity (i.e., ECOG score of 1). A total of 136 subjects (52.1%) had normal renal 
function (CRCL ≥ 90 mL/min), while 98 (37.5%) patients presented mild renal impairment (CRCL from 60 
to 89 mL/min), 25 (9.6%) patients moderate renal impairment (CRCL from 30 to 59 mL/min). The 
population PK model previously developed for cetuximab was a two-compartment linear disposition model 
with saturable elimination rate with a zero-order elimination constant. 
A total of 15 PK samples were excluded due to unscheduled visit, measurable concentrations before the 
1st dose and deviation on the PK sample collection. Due to the sparse PK samples collected in most of the 
patients in BEACON study, typical values of peripheral compartment (i.e., CL2 and V2) were fixed the 
values estimated by Azzopardi et al. Re-estimation of K0 value with the BEACON data significantly 
improved the overall fits (cetu2) and was thus retained as the structural model. The source of cetuximab 
(i.e., European versus US sources) was tested on CL but was not relevant. Variability on the peripheral 
parameters was not retained due to important shrinkage (i.e., >30%). The structural model resulted in 
adequate goodness of- fit, with three outlier concentrations observed on IPRED. Nevertheless, the model 
was deemed adequate by the company to evaluate the relations between PK parameters and covariates. 
The final model included the following covariates 
- CL: BSA and sex 
- Vc: BSA and sex 
The stability of the final population PK model was tested by using the non-parametric bootstrap approach 
where 600 samples were statistically evaluated. All covariates were statistically significant with null 
hypothesis excluded from the 95%CI, at the exception of BSA on V. No residual trend was observed with 
the final model of cetuximab. Population PK parameters of cetuximab derived with the final population PK 
model are presented in Table 12.

A small bias for three PK samples of cetuximab with high IPRED and lower DV. With the exception of 
those points, for the overall range of cetuximab, the overlay of the LOESS fit for the observed, individual 
predicted and population predicted support the agreement with the model predicted and observed data. 
A pcVPC for the final model is shown in figure 13.50.

Distributions of estimates in covariate effects derived with the bootstrap were used to evaluate the 
relevance of covariate effects (mean and 95% CI) on the relative changes in exposures of cetuximab at 
steady-state (AUCss and Cmaxss) based on the demographic data in BEACON study relative to the 
reference patient (i.e., a female patient with body surface area of 1.8 m2).  
The magnitude of effect of each covariate on CL based on the final model is depicted using a tornado plot 
and the magnitude and covariate effects on AUCss and Cmaxss in patients from BEACON study are 
presented in Figure 7.

In terms of categorical covariates, male patients would have significantly lower cetuximab exposures to 
the reference patient with point estimates lower than 80% (i.e., 76.9% lower for AUCss). 
In terms of continuous covariates, medians and 95% CI of BSA effects on AUCss and Cmaxss were within 
80% and 125% relative to the reference patient. 
Relationships between individual and individual random effects of PK parameters derived with the final 
population PK model of cetuximab versus covariates are presented in a scatter matrix plots and boxplots.

Pharmacokinetics in target population 
•  Encorafenib 
Study CLGX818X2103 
Geometric mean exposure parameters increased with an increased dose, with moderate to high inter-
subject variability. On Cycle 2 Day 1, the AUCtau accumulation ratio (RAUC) of encorafenib was below 1 
across all dose ranges (except the lowest dose 100 mg QD), which is consistent with the auto-induction of 
encorafenib clearance. 
Table 2  Pharmacokinetics of encorafenib in combination with cetuximab after single and 
multiple QD doses 
Dose proportionality was assessed over the encorafenib dose range of 100 mg to 450 mg QD 
administered with cetuximab. On C2D1, encorafenib exposure increased in a less than proportional 
manner for AUCtau.

Table 3  Dose proportionality analysis for encorafenib in combination with cetuximab 
Study ARRAY-818-302 
PK Data from 267 subjects were available from the BEACON CRC study, with 37 subjects from the Safety 
Lead-in portion and 230 subjects from the randomized portion. Data were analysed with non-
compartmental analysis (report CP19-14), and included in the popPK model T2019-00141.  
The GeoMean  plasma/serum concentration-time profiles from the safety lead-in part for each analyte and 
visit are presented below. With variability taken in consideration, GeoMean concentrations were similar 
between the two visits (C1D1 and C2D1) for binimetinib and cetuximab and slightly lower at C2D1 for 
AR00426032 and encorafenib. Due to the limited sampling schedule, the elimination phase was not well 
characterized for many subjects. The elimination phase dependent results (ie. AUCinf, LambdaZ, Half-life) 
only reflect less than half of the cohort, at best, and any conclusions based on this data should take this 
into consideration [data not shown].

For the randomized Phase 3 at C2D1, the GeoMean (GeoCV%) concentration of encorafenib at 2 hours 
post-dose, i.e. ~Tmax, in the Doublet was 1550 ng/mL(143%). In the Triplet, the GeoMean concentration 
was 969 ng/mL (273%). GeoMean predose concentrations were 12.4 ng/mL (139%) in the doublet and 
23.3 ng/mL (375%) in the triplet.

•  Binimetinib 
In the SLI phase a small decrease in exposure at steady state was noted and is not considered 
meaningful due to moderately high variability that accompanies these results. At C2D1 in Phase 3, the 2 
hours post-dose GeoMean concentration was 268 ng/mL (77.8%), the GeoMean predose concentration 
was 48.8 ng/mL (112%).  
Lower exposure parameter values were observed for AR00426032 at Cycle 2, with lower exposures 
following multiple doses compared to a single dose (lower right figure).

•  Cetuximab 
Cetuximab’s mean concentrations were slightly higher at C2D1 with approximately 15% compared to 
C1D1, with the total loading dose amount given at C1D1 was higher than the maintenance dose at C2D1 
(400 mg/m2 and 250 mg/m2, respectively). The GeoMean Cmax was relatively similar between the two 
visits. Geometric mean Cmax [199 μg/mL (26.8%)] in the CSLI portion was comparable to the mean 
value reported in Tabernero, 2010 [210 μg/mL (54%)]. Cmin for the Phase 3 at C2D1 was 46200 ng/mL

(66.6%) in the control, 54500 ng/mL (103%) in the doublet and was 52800 ng/mL (47.2%) in the triplet 
arm. 
The population estimates of CL and Vc for cetuximab were 0.0154 L/h (i.e., 0.370 L/day) and 3.52 L, 
respectively. Based on the population PK model, half-life values associated with t1/2α and t1/2β phases 
of cetuximab were 34.4 h and 17.7 days, respectively. Total volume of distribution was 8.17 L (i.e., 
3.52 + 4.65 L).

PopPK report CP19-013  
External visual predictive checks (VPC) for encorafenib, binimetinib and cetuximab were performed to 
evaluate a potential drug-drug interaction between the binimetinib-encorafenib combination with 
cetuximab, as well as to assess differences between the mCRC and melanoma populations. The median, 
5th and 95th percentiles of observed concentrations from the ARRAY-818-302 study and simulated 
concentrations using a published model (cetuximab) and prior models generated with a population of 
patients with melanoma (binimetinib and encorafenib) are in good agreement. No major differences in the 
observed data, relative to the simulated data, suggest that a clinically relevant interaction between 
binimetinib, encorafenib and cetuximab is unlikely. Additionally, there are no major differences observed 
in the colorectal population in BEACON-CRC relative to the model that was constructed from a majority of 
melanoma patients simulated as part of the external VPC. These results support the conclusion that there 
is no clinically relevant disease effect on the PK of binimetinib, AR00426032 or encorafenib. 
Special populations 
PopPK modelling report T2019-00141 
When comparing with the encorafenib models performed in patients with melanoma, most of the 
covariates included in this new analysis are similar to the covariates included in the improved model of 
encorafenib (T2019-00140) and the previous one (T2017-01151) except for the body weight which was 
not included on Ka and V/F in the current model and potential effect of disease status (mCRC vs 
melanoma vs other tumours vs healthy) which was quantified. Based on the 95% CI calculated by 
bootstrap, all the included covariate effects were statistically significant except the effects of AST, renal 
impairment and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors on CL/F and the effect of age on V/F. 
•  Encorafenib 
In the final model CYP3A4 inhibitor effects and age accounted for the largest contribution of variability in 
CL/F. All covariate effects had no significant impact on PK exposures (AUCss and Cmaxss) of encorafenib 
with point estimates within 80% and 125% relative to the reference patient. None of the included 
covariates appear to be clinically relevant based on this analysis since all point estimates were lower than 
20%.

•  Binimetinib 
In terms of continuous covariates, medians and 95% CI of the following covariate effects on AUCss and 
Cmaxss were within 80% and 125% relative to the reference patient: age, AST and BIL. Exposures of 
binimetinib (AUCss and Cmaxss) would significantly change with the body weight range included in BEACON 
study: patients of 48.4 kg would have 29% and 33% higher AUCss and Cmaxss respectively relative to the

reference patient; whereas patients of 99.5 kg, only Cmaxss of binimetinib is significantly affected with a 
point estimate of 0.785 for lower Cmaxss. However, the 95%CI of these estimates are inclusive of the 80% 
- 125%, suggesting a lack of clinical significance.

•  Cetuximab 
In terms of categorical covariates, male patients would have significantly lower cetuximab exposures to 
the reference patient [female patient with a body surface area of 1.8m2] with point estimates lower than 
80% (i.e., 76.9% for AUCss). 
• 
Impaired renal function 
In the population PK performed with patients with mCRC (T2019-00141), mild (n=111) and moderate 
(n=30) renal impairment was assessed as a categorical covariate using Creatinine clearance (CLCR) 
calculated with Cockcroft-Gault method. Based on Forest plots, limited increase in encorafenib AUC and 
Cmax were observed in patients with mild (CRCL from 60 to 89 mL/min) and moderate (CRCL from 30 to 
59 mL/min) renal impairment (maximum difference of 11 %) compared to patients with normal renal 
function (n=251, CRCL ≥90 mL/min). No dose adjustment is recommended/required for subjects with 
mild or moderate renal impairment based on the population PK analyses. A recommended dose has not 
been established for subjects with severe renal impairment, and so encorafenib should be used with 
caution in these patients. 
Based on Forest plots, no increase in binimetinib AUC and Cmaxss was evident in patients with mild or 
moderate /severe (< 30 mL/min) renal impairment compared to subjects with normal renal function. No 
binimetinib dose adjustment is recommended/required for subjects with renal impairment. 
• 
Impaired hepatic function 
In the population PK analysis (T2019-00141), the covariate of hepatic impairment indicated no 
significant trend in encorafenib CL/F or V/F when comparing healthy subjects (N=300) with mild hepatic 
impairment subjects (N=91). Given the limited number of subjects available in the moderate and severe 
hepatic impairment categories (N=1 in each category), no evaluation could be performed in these groups.

Figure 3  Final PopPK Model of Encorafenib - Sources of Variability –NCI Organ Dysfunction 
Group 
Based on the comparable safety and tolerability observed between mild HI patients and patients with 
normal hepatic function, encorafenib can be administered to mild HI patients with the same precautionary 
measures and at the same dose of 300 mg QD as in the melanoma indication. In the absence of clinical 
data, encorafenib is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment in all 
indications. 
In the popPK analysis for binimetinib, no data were available for moderate and severe hepatic 
impairment. 41 patients over 181 exhibited a mild hepatic impairment. Based upon this information, no 
residual covariate effect of mild impairment can be shown on binimetinib CL/F and V/F in the final model. 
Taken together, no dose adjustment is proposed in subjects with mild hepatic impairment (Child Pugh A).

Figure 4  Final PopPK Model of Binimetinib - Sources of Variability –NCI Organ Dysfunction 
Group 
In order to provide similar exposure to patients with normal hepatic function, the dose in moderate and 
severe hepatic impairment should be adjusted to 15 mg BID. However, as encorafenib is not 
recommended in patients with moderate (Child Pugh B) or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C), 
administration of binimetinib is not recommended in these patients. 
In addition, EMA CHMP requested as a post authorisation measure (PAM), to assess the PK and the safety 
of encorafenib when administered in combination with binimetinib in cancer patients with moderate or 
severe hepatic impairment. A clinical study is planned (W00090GE101) to fulfil this requirement and 
results are due by December 2023. 
• 
Gender 
Sex was not retained as a covariate in the final model for encorafenib and binimetinib. Based on a visual 
inspection of the residual plots of post-hoc CL/F and V/F with sex, no sex-specific trends on encorafenib 
CL/F or V/F were observed. Based on this no encorafenib and binimetinib dose adjustment based on sex 
is recommended necessary. 
• 
Race/Ethnic origin 
Comparison between the two cohorts (Japanese and non-Japanese) in the SLI portion does not indicate 
any significant difference in exposure of all analytes at steady state. Even though geometric ratios were 
at some occasions lower or higher than 1.00 (0.95-1.19) for dose-normalised Cmax and AUClast at 
C2D1, the variability in results (reflected by large CIs) hinders any conclusive difference and suggest a 
lack of substantial differences between the Japanese and non-Japanese patients. 
Descriptive statistics for Asian and non-Asian cohorts were compared at steady state C2D1 for 
exploratory purposes, as discussed in PK report CP19-14. For binimetinib and encorafenib, all trough 
concentrations appear to be slightly higher in the Asian population, while post-dose concentrations at 
2 hours are slightly lower (Table 8). Trough and concentrations at 2 hours for AR00426032 were higher 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/271532/2020 
Page 66/224 
 
 
  
  
 
for Asian population. However, a high GeoCV% is observed with these results across all analytes, 
indicating that concentrations are widely distributed compared to the mean and inter-subject variability 
is significant. A difference in total number of subjects for each cohort is also observed, having only 4 to 6 
subjects in the Asian population in the doublet and triplet arms, thus impacting definitive conclusions 
between Asians and non-Asians in these arms. No important difference was observed for cetuximab, 
either for trough concentrations or at 2 hours post dose. 
Table 8  Comparison of Concentrations (ng/mL) between Asian and Non-Asian Cohorts for 
the Randomized Portion based on GeoMean (GeoCV%) 
In the popPK model, no clear trend were observed in individual PK parameters (CL/F, V/F and Ka) 
regarding the race/ethnic covariates. 
Taken together, neither ethnic origin nor race are considered clinically relevant for encorafenib and 
binimetinib PK when administered in combination with cetuximab, and as a result no dose adjustments 
are proposed based on race/ethnicity. 
• 
Weight 
Body weight was found to be a significant covariate for encorafenib CL/F and binimetinib CL/F and V/F 
and therefore retained in the final model (see above). However, given the small magnitude of changes in 
encorafenib PK parameters predicted in the models, weight is unlikely to be clinically relevant. Based on 
this, no dose adjustment based on body weight is recommended. 
• 
Elderly 
The influence of age was evaluated in the population PK analysis (Report T2019-00141). Age as a 
covariate was retained in the final model on the encorafenib CL/F, V/F and Ka terms. Although small 
sample size in older groups gave limited information, the residual on the post-hoc derived AUC or Cmax 
and age in the Forest plot showed no definitive trend between the 5th and 95th percentiles of age (40.2 
years and 76.9 years) compared to the median (58 years).

Table 9  PK Exposure Levels of encorafenib by Age – Study ARRAY-818-302 
Age was retained as a significant covariate in the final model on the binimetinib CL/F term, however the 
residual on the post-hoc derived AUC or Cmax in the Forest plots showed no definitive trend. Similarly, no 
major influence of age on binimetinib PK was identified in the previous population PK analyses integrating 
the melanoma patient population as monotherapy or in combination with encorafenib (Reports CP16-001 
and CP17-004).

Page 68/224 
 
 
  
  
 
 
Table 10  PK Exposure Levels of binimetinib by Age–Study ARRAY-818-302 
Given the small magnitude of PK parameters change predicted in the models, age is unlikely to be 
clinically relevant. Based on this, no dose adjustment of encorafenib and binimetinib based on age is 
recommended. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No new clinical studies were performed for evaluation of drug-drug interactions for either encorafenib or 
binimetinib.  
DDI between the combination partners 
PopPK report CP19-013 evaluated the potential of DDI of cetuximab on the PK of encorafenib and 
binimetinib by external VPCs. No major differences in the observed data, relative to the simulated data, 
suggest that a clinically relevant interaction between binimetinib, encorafenib and cetuximab is unlikely. 
Additionally, there are no major differences observed in the colorectal population in BEACON-CRC relative 
to the model that was constructed from a majority of melanoma patients simulated as part of the 
external VPC. These results support the conclusion that there is no clinically relevant disease effect on the 
PK of binimetinib, AR00426032 or encorafenib. 
Within popPK model T2019-00141, as categorical covariates, DDI between the combination partners 
have been analysed as sources of variability on Cl and V, and rate of absorption (Ka) in patients.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Cardiac safety 
No supplementary exposure-cardiac electrophysiology analyses were conducted to support this new 
mCRC indication. 
Given that no drug drug interactions were evidenced between binimetinib and cetuximab, no impact of 
the combination with cetuximab on a QT prolongation is expected. Taken all together, these results 
suggest that binimetinib in combination with encorafenib and cetuximab does not cause clinically 
meaningful QT prolongation or HR changes at the proposed therapeutic doses.  
Biomarkers 
Tumour Marker and Biomarker Results 
In Phase 3, median Baseline Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA) values were higher in the Triplet arm 
(29.4 μg/L) than the Doublet and Control arms (18.0 and 23.3 μg/L, respectively). Baseline CEA values 
>5 μg/L were reported in a greater proportion of patients in the Triplet and Control arms (79.9% and 
80.5%, respectively) than the Doublet arm (69.5%). In these patients, the median percent decrease from 
Baseline to nadir CEA value was greater in the Triplet and Doublet arms (-87.3% and -86.1%, 
respectively) than the Control arm (-34.5%). 
In Phase 3, median Baseline Carbohydrate Antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) values were higher in the Triplet 
and Doublet arms (224.3 and 221.2 U/mL, respectively) than the Control arm (187.6 U/mL). Baseline 
CA19-9 values >35 U/mL were reported in a comparable proportion of patients in each treatment arm 
(71.0% Triplet arm, 67.7% Doublet arm, 70.6% Control arm). In these patients, the median percent 
decrease from Baseline to nadir CA19-9 value was greater in the Triplet and Doublet arms (-89.1% and -
91.5%, respectively) than the Control arm (-40.1%). 
Genomic and Proteomic Biomarkers 
An exploratory objective of the study was to assess blood- and tissue-based biomarkers that may be 
predictive of biological activity. Analyses for this exploratory biomarker objective are not included in this 
report. The Sponsor plans to conduct laboratory testing for biomarkers after all sample collection 
(including the EOT samples) is completed 
2.3.1.   PK/PD modelling 
Exposure-response analyses 
E/R analyses in the target mCRC population were discussed in popPK report T2019-00141. Exposure-
response relationships were performed using the ARRAY-818-302 study data on a PK dataset pooling 
patients from the CSLI part and a subset of patients of the Phase 3 portion on whom blood samples were 
collected for purposes of PK and exposure-responses analyses. The exposure efficacy dataset included 92 
patients for the Triplet, 68 patients for the Doublet and 99 patients for the Control arm. Given that the 
exposure-efficacy relationships were developed on a subset of patients of the whole dataset of study 
ARRAY-818-302, the exposure-efficacy analysis was considered as exploratory.

The PK set comprises only one third of the FAS, of which the control arm (~45%) is better represented 
than the Triplet and Doublet arms. Especially the Triplet is underrepresented with only 26% of patients 
having contributed with sparse-sampling PK data in the randomised phase III part; see Table 17 from 
CSR: 
Exposure-efficacy analyses 
Exposure-efficacy relationships were explored between the individual predicted exposure metrics at 
steady state (AUCss, Cmax,ss and Cmin,ss) and OS, PFS and ORR endpoints through descriptive Kaplan-
Meier (KM) plots for OS and PFS (derived by high/low exposures relative to the median) and single 
descriptive logistic regression for ORR. Cox regression model was performed with PFS and OS endpoints 
to evaluate the effects of each drug and risk factors by pooling all the information. A logistic regression 
model was evaluated between the drug exposure metrics and the ORR endpoints and risk factors. 
Parametric time-to-event regression models were performed with PFS and OS outcomes using time-
varying average concentrations (Cavg) in order to account for dose reductions and interruptions. 
New exploratory exposure efficacy analyses for the Doublet and Control arms show the benefit of the 
combination encorafenib + cetuximab through the positive interaction terms of encorafenib and 
cetuximab AUC in the OS Cox Hazard Model and through a reduction in the rate of death or progression 
(PFS) with cetuximab and encorafenib Cavg using a parametric time to event regression model. These 
analyses further support the efficacy of the combination of encorafenib with cetuximab in the treatment 
of patients with mCRC with BRAF V600E mutation. 
Exposure-efficacy analyses were revised for Doublet and Control arms upon request. They showed the 
benefit of E+C through the positive interaction terms of encorafenib and cetuximab AUCs in the OS Cox 
Hazard Model, and through a reduction in the rate of death or progression (PFS) with cetuximab and 
encorafenib Cavg using a parametric time to event regression model. No such relationship was found for 
ORR.  
Exposure-safety analyses 
Exposure-response relationships between model-derived exposures (encorafenib, binimetinib and 
cetuximab) in patients in BEACON and CLGX818X2103 studies and the probability of the following AEs 
were explored: arthralgia/musculoskeletal pain (grade≥2), diarrhoea (grade≥2), blood creatinine 
elevation (all grades), creatine phosphokinase elevation (all grades), skin adverse events (grade≥2) and 
retinal events (grade≥2). 
E/R relationships were explored as a function of exposure levels of each drug based on PK exposure levels 
derived with randomized dose at treatment assignment assuming steady-state conditions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/271532/2020 
Page 73/224 
 
 
  
  
 
Negative significant relationships were observed between the probability of arthralgia/musculoskeletal 
pain (grade≥2) and AUCss and Cmaxss of encorafenib. Negative significant relationship (p<0.05) was 
observed between the probability of skin adverse events (grade≥2) and cetuximab PK parameters (i.e., 
AUCss, Cmaxss, Cminss). Positive significant relationship (p<0.05) between the probability of retinal 
events (grade≥2) and binimetinib Cmaxss. 
No statistical significant relationships with diarrhoea, blood creatinine elevation and creatine 
phosphokinase elevation were found. Given that the diarrhoea adverse events were the most observed AE 
in BEACON study, the lack of relationships between diarrhoea AE and encorafenib, binimetinib or 
cetuximab exposures could be explained by confounding effects between the 3 drugs. 
In the requested second analysis the exposure-safety relationships were explored by arm and by analyte 
using data from Study ARRAY-818-302 only. 
2.3.2.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Two new clinical studies in support of the application in mCRC provide new PK data, the Phase Ib/II study 
CLGX818X2103 and the pivotal Phase III study ARRAY-818-302 (BEACON). The data were also included 
in 2 new population PK and/or exposure response (ER) analyses. This is considered acceptable for the 
current variation. 
The PK sampling schemes to determine binimetinib, encorafenib and cetuximab seem adequate, when 
considering that in the lead-in-part of the mCRC study rich sampling for encorafenib was performed and 
basic popPK models for binimetinib and encorafenib were already available from the initial MAA in 
melanoma patients. Cetuximab PK was, however, only analysed in the phase III study portion. 
For molecular screening of presence of BRAF-V600E mutation [and absence of RASmut] for study 
eligibility only PCR and NGS-based methods were allowed and needed confirmation by the central lab.  
The Population PK analyses were performed based on five clinical studies in healthy subjects, patients 
with unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600 mutant melanoma and patients with BRAF V600E-mutant 
mCRC from the following clinical trials: BEACON (ARRAY-818-302), Study CLGX818X2103, 
CMEK162X2110, CLGX818X2101 and ARRAY-162-105. 
The popPK model previously developed for encorafenib was a two-compartment model with first order 
absorption and time-dependent clearance described with a dose-dependent Emax model. Different 
changes to the model were tested but finally the previous model was considered to be appropriate.  
The final model included the following covariates: age on ka, disease status, ECOG status, moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors, TPROT, BIL, LDH, age and bw on CL, dose on Emax.  
The concomitant medication with CYP inducers does not seem to have had a significant effect on the PK of 
encorafenib.  
Since all point estimates were within 80% and 125% relative to the reference patient the company 
considered that the covariates, except for comedication with CYP 3A4 inhibitors, which is already 
mentioned in the SmPC, did not have a clinically relevant effect on the PK parameters of encorafenib.  
The auto-induction of clearance was implemented as a time-dependent function and the height of the 
maximal clearance was dose-dependent due to the covariate dose on Emax. The estimated time to 
achieve 50% of the maximum CL/F (T50) was 67.3 h after the 1st dose (2-3 days) and based on this 
calculated time to reach 90% of the maximal effect is 605.7 h (25 days i.e 3.6 weeks).

The MAH explained the strategy chosen for data selection in order to generate a manageable, meaningful 
database for the model. Exclusion of study data was justified. In total, 96 patients with metastatic 
melanoma (~ 25 % of the full dataset) and 236 patients with mCRC (~ 68% of the full dataset) were 
included in the dataset for a full population analysis in mCRC and melanoma populations. With this 
dataset, computational run times of the model were acceptable. GOF plots and VPCs were provided for 
the 200mg, 300 mg and 450 mg doses, separately. The MAH provided individual GOF plots of the rich 
sampling profiles of Study ARRAY-818-302 (BEACON) and Study CLGX818X2103. The MAH provided VPCs 
for all studies included in the PopPK analysis, separately (studies ARRAY-818-302, CLGX818X2103, 
CMEK162X2110, CLGX818X2101 and ARRAY-162-105). The provided plots reveal that overall, model 
performance is acceptable. GOF plots for population and individual predictions were provided. 
One aim of the PopPK analysis for cetuximab was to evaluate any effect of encorafenib and binimetinib on 
cetuximab PK profiles. According to the model results, no difference in cetuximab clearance and volume 
of distribution could be found when combined with encorafenib or encorafenib + binimetinib.  
The source of cetuximab (i.e., European versus US sources) was tested on CL since US-licensed 
cetuximab provides approximately 22% higher exposure than EU-approved cetuximab. This effect did not 
show significance. In addition, the different sources were investigated comparing the relations between 
individual PK parameters and individual random effects of CL and V. This evaluation also did show no 
differences. PcVPCs show that typical values are slightly underpredicted and variability considerably 
overpredicted. 
Encorafenib PK was time-dependent and less than dose-proportional also in the newly studied 
combination(s). CL/F was increased to 2.5-3-fold at C2D1 which is consistent with the encorafenib-
mediated auto-induction of its main metabolic enzyme CYP3A4. Ctrough in the triplet was comparable to 
what was measured in Part 2 of the COLUMBUS study in melanoma patients with 300mg for the E+B 
combo. 
It is noted that steady-state %CV was huge for encorafenib PK in the triplet, especially in the randomised 
phase III part. In previous studies %CV was usually below 100% whereas here it was observed with 140-
375%. This high inter-subject variability in PK resulted from PK sampling data unaccounted for time of 
drug intake. 
From the popPK, binimetinib AUCss was comparable to that observed previously with the 300mg E+B 
combo. However, lower Cmaxss and Cminss were observed in the current analysis and are suggested by 
the MAH to be explained by the structure of the absorption model. The appropriateness of the current 
model for binimetinib was questioned, but not further pursued due to withdrawal of binimetinib.  
For the active metabolite AR00426032 lower exposure was observed in steady state.  
No obvious pharmacokinetic impact of encorafenib or binimetinib on the PK of cetuximab was seen and 
mean Cmax was comparable with the value for steady-state given in the EU-Erbitux SmPC. PopPK 
modelling and evaluation of external VPCs supported absence of clinically relevant, mutual drug 
interactions of E, B and C.  
The US-FDA label of Erbitux states that the systemic exposure of US-sourced cetuximab was 22% (90% 
CI: 6%, 38%) higher than that of another (= EU-sourced) cetuximab product. Therefore, randomisation 
was stratified [beside others] according to cetuximab source (US vs. EU). Ca. 18-20% of the study 
population received US-sourced cetuximab and indeed, mean AUC of the US source were 25%, 13 % and 
20 % higher than the EU source for the Triplet, Doublet and Control arm, respectively.  
Special populations 
Impact on PK in special populations were analysed largely by popPK modelling. Clinically relevant 
differences between melanoma and mCRC patients were not observed.

EMA/CHMP/271532/2020

Male patients were modelled to have significantly lower cetuximab exposures than the female reference 
patient [BSA of 1.8m2] with 76.9% for AUCss. No such information is given in the EU-Erbitux SmPC but 
the US label provides congruent information of a 25% lower intrinsic clearance in females. No dose 
adaptions are recommended up to to-date and thus the clinical relevance in the targeted combination is 
also considered of minor importance.  
In the final encorafenib model CYP3A4 inhibitor effects and age accounted for the largest contribution of 
variability in CL/F, whereas exposures of binimetinib would relevantly change with the body weight range: 
patients of 48.4 kg would have 29% and 33% higher AUCss and Cmaxss respectively relative to the 
reference patient. As binimetinib was withdrawn from the applied indication, this was not further pursued.  
In line with previous data, renal impairment has low impact on PK of both drugs. Hence, no dose 
adjustment is recommended/required in mCRC patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. A 
recommended dose for encorafenib has not been established for subjects with severe renal impairment. 
Encorafenib is proposed for mild HI patients at the same 300 mg QD dose as in the melanoma indication, 
i.e. no special dose reduction is proposed here, based on comparable safety in mCRC patients with mild 
HI and those with normal hepatic function. This is acceptable. In the absence of clinical data, encorafenib 
is not recommended in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment in all indications.  
As a post authorisation measure from the initial MAA, a clinical study is planned (W00090GE101) to 
assess PK and safety of encorafenib in combination with binimetinib in cancer patients with moderate or 
severe HI, with results due by December 2023. 
Binimetinib and encorafenib trough concentrations appeared to be slightly higher in the Asian population 
whereas Cmax was slightly lower. A high geoCV% was mainly observed for encorafenib for the non-Asian 
subgroup; however, due to the small sample size in the Asian population, definitive conclusions between 
Asians and non-Asians in these arms cannot reliably be drawn. 
Only small PK changes were predicted for age effects, although in the final encorafenib model age was 
one of 2 covariates accounting for the largest contribution of variability in CL/F. No dose adjustments of 
encorafenib and binimetinib based on age are recommended which is acceptable based on current 
knowledge. 
In the paediatric population no data are currently available for both drug substances. As part of the PIP 
(EMEA 001588-PIP01-13) a study in paediatric mBRAF-melanoma patients is planned. 
The dosing recommendations given in the SmPC are in line with the MAH’s conclusions drawn from the 
new clinical data. 
Drug interactions 
The covariate effect of CYP3A4 inducers may have been inadequately evaluated in the submitted popPK 
model(s) of encorafenib. The population baseline characteristics show that in the group “absence of 
CYP3A4 inducers” also patients with weak inducers were included. As most mCRC patients are probably 
receiving a glucocorticoid (e.g. dexamethasone) as a commonly recommended cetuximab pre-medication 
and this is a known CYP3A4 inducer, the broad variability of Ka, CL and V could potentially also be 
resultant from weak CYP3A4 induction. Re-classification of glucocorticoids to weak inducers and re-
modelling showed low clinically relevant interaction potential, especially as the pre-medication is only 
given once weekly. 
DDI with other common recommended cetuximab pre-medications, such as diphenhydramine (CYP2D6 
inhibitor) or e.g. prednisone (CYP2C inducer are neither of clinical importance, as these enzymes do not 
concern major metabolic pathways of encorafenib.  
Pharmacodynamics

The MAH discussed that EGFR signalling has the potential to bypass mBRAF inhibition and by that lead to 
therapeutic resistance in BRAFV600E CRC. Thus, a BRAFi in combination with an EGFR inhibitor (i.e., 
inhibiting the activated oncogene and the dominant reactivated receptor), could optimise the MAPK 
pathway suppression and could lead to improved efficacy in BRAFV600E-mutant CRC compared to a BRAF 
inhibitor only. 
In addition, as most resistance signals in BRAF-mCRC occur in the MAPK pathway upstream of MEK, this 
suggested that the addition of a MEK inhibitor to BRAF plus EGFR inhibitors could lead to an improved and 
more durable suppression of ERK signalling and therefore to improved response rates. 
No new data have been obtained in the new indication with regard to cardiac safety. The PI texts of both 
products have thus not been amended. This is considered acceptable. 
Exposure-efficacy analyses were revised for Doublet and Control arms. They showed the benefit of E+C 
through the positive interaction terms of encorafenib and cetuximab AUCs in the OS Cox Hazard Model, 
and through a reduction in the rate of death or progression (PFS) with cetuximab and encorafenib Cavg 
using a parametric time to event regression model. No such relationship was found for ORR. 
Exposure-safety relationships were explored by arm and by analyte using data from Study ARRAY-818-
302 only. The most relevant E-R result was that the estimated probability of anaemia (grade≥2) increased 
from 9.18% to 13.8% from the lowest to the highest quartiles of encorafenib AUC. 
On the contrary, increasing encorafenib exposure reduced the probability of the cetuximab ADR acneiform 
dermatitis (grade≥2) from 11.6% to 0.86%. 
No other statistically significant relationships between encorafenib exposure and the events of interest 
(renal failure, diarrhoea, arthralgia/muscuskeletal pain) have been identified. 
2.3.3.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology data submitted to support the use of encorafenib in combination with 
cetuximab for the treatment of BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer is considered acceptable. 
From a clinical pharmacology point of view the application is approvable.

Dose-response analyses were not conducted. Evaluations of dose proportionality were submitted within 
the initial Marketing authorisation application Supporting the melanoma indication. 
Phase Ib part of study CLGX818X2103 is labelled as a dose finding study and is investigating cetuximab 
in combination with increasing encorafenib doses. However, this part of trial 2103 is investigating PK but 
not response.

Methods 
In the Phase III portion of the study, a total of approximately 615 eligible patients with BRAF V600E-
mutant mCRC who had progressed on 1 or 2 prior metastatic regimens were to be randomized in a 1:1:1 
ratio to one of the following 3 treatment arms: 
• 
Triplet arm: encorafenib 300 mg QD + binimetinib 45 mg BID + standard cetuximab (400 mg/m2 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/271532/2020 
Page 79/224 
 
 
  
  
 
followed by 250 mg/m2 IV QW) 
Doublet arm: encorafenib 300 mg QD + standard cetuximab (400 mg/m2 followed by 250 mg/m2 
IV QW) 
Control arm: Investigator’s choice of either irinotecan/cetuximab or FOLFIRI/cetuximab, with the 
• 
• 
choice to be declared prior to randomization 
The number of third-line patients (those who had received 2 prior regimens) was limited per protocol to 
35% of the total randomized Phase III population, after which only patients with 1 prior regimen were to 
be randomized. Patients with 2 prior regimens who had entered Screening at the time that the limit had 
been reached were to be permitted to continue into the study if they were otherwise determined to be 
eligible. 
Randomization was stratified according to the following factors: 
• 
• 
• 
Baseline ECOG PS (0 vs. 1), 
Prior use of irinotecan (yes vs. no), 
Cetuximab source (US-licensed vs. EU-approved). 
To confirm tolerability, the DMC reviewed the available safety information after the first 30 patients in the 
randomized Phase 3 portion of the study (i.e., approximately 10 patients in each arm) had the 
opportunity to complete at least 1 (28-day) cycle of treatment. During the remainder of the study, the 
DMC was to review safety data at regular intervals. 
An initial analysis of the Phase III portion of the study was to be performed when all 3 of the following 
criteria were met: 
• 
• 
• 
Approximately 9 months after randomization of the 330th patient (i.e., approximately 110 patients 
per arm), to allow a majority of responders among the 330 Phase III patients to have had the 
opportunity to be followed for approximately 6 months or longer after their first response 
At least 188 OS events had occurred in the Triplet and Control arms combined (i.e., approximately 
70% information) 
At least 169 OS events had occurred in the Doublet and Control arms combined (i.e., 
approximately 50% information) 
The primary analysis of Triplet arm vs. Control arm ORR by BICR was to occur at this time and was to be 
based on the first 330 randomized patients. An interim analysis for superiority or (non-binding) futility of 
the Triplet arm vs. Control arm OS endpoint was also to be performed at the time of the primary ORR 
analysis based on all available data. The independent DMC reviewed and interpreted the analysis results 
for both of the primary endpoints, which were conducted by an independent statistician. If the interim 
analysis for OS of the Triplet arm vs. Control arm exceeded the superiority boundary, patients in the 
Triplet and Doublet arms will continue to be followed for a more mature comparison. 
If the OS interim analysis results did not cross the superiority boundary, the OS final analysis was to 
occur once at least 268 events were observed in the Triplet arm + Control arm and at least 338 events 
were observed in the Doublet arm + Control arm. 
If the p value for the Triplet arm vs. Control arm OS comparison exceeded the superiority boundary at 
either the interim or final analysis, the following endpoints were to be tested at that time in the following 
order: 1) OS of Doublet arm vs. Control arm, 2) ORR (per BICR) of Doublet arm vs. Control arm, 3) PFS 
(per BICR) of Triplet arm vs. Control arm, and 4) PFS (per BICR) of Doublet arm vs. Control arm. 
The overall testing strategy of the study is summarized in Figure 2.

The study consisted of the following phases: 
BRAF Testing/Molecular Prescreening, Screening and Enrollment (SLI and 
JSLICohorts)/Randomization (Phase III) 
Patients must have had an identified BRAF V600E mutation to be eligible for the study. For patients with 
unknown BRAF mutation status or BRAF wild-type by local assay, the BRAF V600E mutation status was to 
be determined by the central laboratory during molecular prescreening from an adequate archival tumor 
sample or fresh tumor biopsy.  
Central laboratory BRAF mutation tests with a definitive result (positive or negative) were not permitted 
to be repeated to resolve a discordant result. If at any time in the study there was lack of BRAF V600E 
confirmation in a total of 37 patients (6% of the total planned total planned randomization of 615 
patients) or discordance between the local assay and the central laboratory in 18 patients, all subsequent 
patients were required to have BRAF V600E determined by the central laboratory for enrollment. 
The Screening period began once the patient signed the Screening ICF, and all assessments, including 
screening tumor assessments, were performed within a maximum of 28 days prior to enrollment (SLI 
and JSLI cohorts)/randomization (Phase III). 
Upon completion of all Screening evaluations, patient eligibility for the study was determined. In the SLI 
and JSLI cohorts, the sponsor or designee handled the enrolment of eligible patients. In Phase III, eligible 
patients were randomized via the IWRS to one of the treatment arms in a 1:1:1 ratio. 
Assessment report

Page 81/224 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Treatment Phase 
Patients in Phase III were to be treated as soon as possible after the randomization number was 
assigned. The first day of treatment was defined as Cycle 1 Day 1. Study treatments were administered 
in continuous 28-day cycles. 
Safety was evaluated through continuous AE monitoring, clinical laboratory assessments (hematology, 
clinical chemistry, coagulation profiles, urinalysis and pregnancy), physical examination, vital signs, 
dermatologic evaluations, ophthalmic assessments, cardiac assessments (ECG, ECHO/MUGA) and 
assessment of ECOG PS. 
Disease status was evaluated locally by the Investigator and retrospectively by BICR according to RECIST 
version 1.1. Tumor evaluations were performed at Screening, every 6 weeks (± 7 days) from the date of 
randomization (or from first dose for SLI and JSLI cohorts) for the first 24 weeks of treatment. Then it 
was performed every 12 weeks (± 7 days) thereafter until disease progression, withdrawal of consent, 
initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy, patient was lost to follow-up, death or defined end of study, 
regardless of whether study treatment was discontinued. Patient-reported outcome assessments were 
also to be performed using QoL questionnaires at Screening and periodically on study. 
Blood and tumor samples were to be collected at Screening and at specified pre- and post-dose time 
points during the study for PK and/or biomarker analyses.  
Patients were to continue study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of 
consent, initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy, death or discontinuation from study treatment for 
any other reason. Continuation of treatment beyond disease progression was allowed in special 
circumstances in which the Investigator believed that the patient may have clinically benefited from 
continued treatment beyond progression and provided that other protocol-specified conditions were met. 
End of Treatment 
An EOT visit was to be performed for all patients, even those who discontinued prematurely, within 14 
days after the last dose of study treatment. The EOT visit was not considered as the end of the study. All 
patients were to enter the follow-up period. 
Follow-up Period 
Regardless of the reason for study treatment discontinuation, all patients were to have a Safety Follow-up 
Visit approximately 30 days after the last dose of study treatment, or prior to the initiation of subsequent 
anticancer therapy, whichever occurred first. Information related to AEs (including concomitant 
medication taken for ongoing AEs) and ongoing antineoplastic treatments were to be collected for 30 days 
after the last dose of study treatment. All AEs suspected to be related to study treatment were to be 
followed until resolution or stabilization of the event. 
After the Safety Follow-up visit, patients were to be followed for survival status, and disease progression, 
if applicable: 
•  Survival Follow-up: patients (including those in the SLI/JSLI cohorts who provided informed 
consent for survival follow-up) were to be followed every 3 months, or more frequently as needed, 
for survival status, all subsequent anticancer therapies, any new SAEs that were considered related 
to study drug and, for Phase III patients, date of disease progression following the initiation of 
subsequent therapies until withdrawal of consent, patient was lost to follow-up, death or defined 
end of study. 
•  Tumor Assessment Follow-up: if study treatment was discontinued for reasons other than 
disease progression or withdrawal of consent to continue study treatment (but not withdrawal of 
consent for study participation, i.e., continued follow-up), patients were to continue to be followed 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/271532/2020 
Page 82/224 
 
 
  
  
with tumor assessments as per the visit schedule, in addition to survival follow-up, until disease 
progression, withdrawal of consent, initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy, patient was lost to 
follow-up or death. 
End of Study 
The end of the study was defined as the point at which all patients have had the opportunity to be 
followed for at least 1 year after the randomization date of the last patient enrolled and at least 80% of 
patients have had an OS event (or were lost to follow-up). 
Study participants

615 in the randomized Phase 3 portion of the study), with histologically confirmed BRAF V600E-mutant 
mCRC whose disease had progressed after 1 or 2 prior regimens in the metastatic setting, were planned

Sample size 
Based on historical evidence, it was assumed that both Control arm options would have an approximate 
median OS of 5 months. The number of patients required for the randomized Phase 3 portion of the study 
was driven by the key secondary endpoint of OS of the Doublet arm vs. Control arm. For this comparison, 
the study was powered to detect an improvement of 2.1 months (7.1 months vs. 5 months; HR = 0.70). 
With 338 OS events, the study has approximately 90% power to detect this improvement using a group-
sequential design and one-sided α = 0.025. Assuming accrual to the randomized Phase 3 portion of the 
study increased over a period of time before reaching a maximum of 25 patients per month (for an 
accrual duration of approximately 25 months) and 5% loss to follow-up, approximately 615 patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/271532/2020 
Page 90/224 
 
 
  
  
 
would be randomized to reach 338 events. The final analysis for OS will occur once at least 268 events 
are observed in the Triplet arm + Control arm and at least 338 events are observed in the Doublet arm + 
Control arm. 
The Sample size calculation was appropriate. 
Randomisation 
In Phase III, randomization was used to ensure that treatment assignment was unbiased. Patients were 
randomized to one of the 3 treatment arms (Triplet arm, Doublet arm or Control arm) in a ratio of 1:1:1. 
The proportion of third-line patients (i.e., those who had received 2 prior regimens) was limited to 35% 
of the total randomized population (estimated in the protocol to be 215 patients, assuming a total 
planned randomization of 615 patients), after which only patients with 1 prior regimen were to be 
randomized. Patients with 2 prior regimens who entered Screening at the time that the limit was reached 
were permitted to continue into the study if they were otherwise determined to be eligible. Randomization 
was stratified by ECOG PS (0 or 1), prior use of irinotecan (yes or no), and cetuximab source (US-
licensed vs. EU-approved). Prior to dosing, all patients who fulfilled all inclusion/exclusion criteria were 
randomized via the interactive web response system (IWRS) to one of the treatment arms.  
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open-label. 
Statistical methods 
For patients in the CSLI (incorporating the SLI [patients in the US and EU] and the JSLI [patients in 
Japan]), the full analysis set (FAS) consisted of all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug 
and had at least 1 post-treatment assessment, which may have included death. 
For patients in the Phase III portion of the study, FAS consisted of all randomized Phase III patients. 
Patients were analyzed according to the treatment arm and stratum they were assigned to at 
randomization. 
The dose determining set (DDS) included all CSLI patients from the Safety Set who either completed a 
minimum exposure requirement and had sufficient safety evaluations or experienced a DLT. 
For the Phase III portion of the study, a primary endpoint and the key secondary efficacy endpoint was 
OS, defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Patients who did not have a death 
date by the data cut-off date were censored for OS at their last contact date. Overall survival was 
calculated for all patients in the FAS and summarized by treatment arm using the Kaplan-Meier method. 
In the SLI portion of the study, OS was an exploratory endpoint, defined as the time from first dose of 
study drug to death due to any cause, using the SLI Efficacy Set. 
For the OS primary endpoint, the null hypothesis of the primary objective was that the OS for the Triplet 
combination is less than or equal to the OS of the Control Arm. The null hypothesis was tested using a 
stratified log-rank test against the α assigned to the endpoint based on the fallback approach (see 
below). The stratification factors used in the test were those used for randomization. 
The distribution of OS was described in tabular and graphical format by treatment group using Kaplan-
Meier methods, reporting the estimated median (in months) with 95% CI and 25th and 75th percentiles 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/271532/2020 
Page 91/224 
 
 
  
  
 
and Kaplan-Meier estimated probabilities with corresponding 95% CI at several time points. A Cox 
regression model stratified by randomization stratification factors was used to estimate the HR of OS, 
along with 95% CI based on the Wald test. 
The following sensitivity analyses were conducted for the randomized Phase III portion of the study to 
support the analyses of OS. The OS analyses were repeated using the PPS. Also, as the Triplet and 
Control arms were anticipated to have more than 268 combined OS events by the time the required 
number of OS events were observed in the Doublet arm and Control arm, the OS analysis of the Triplet 
arm vs. Control arm was repeated using all available OS events. The distribution of OS in the FAS was 
compared between treatment arms using an unstratified log-rank test and the HR (with associated 95% 
CI) resulting from an unstratified Cox model was presented. For the randomized Phase 3 portion of the 
study, the effect of potential prognostic factors was investigated using multivariate stratified Cox 
regression. 
Subgroup analyses were performed for each of the 3 Baseline stratification factors and other relevant 
Baseline variables provided the number of patients randomized with these particular covariates allowed 
(i.e., at least 10 events were to be available in the considered subgroup). 
The ORR by BICR was tested for the primary endpoint of Triplet arm vs. Control arm based on the Phase 
3 Response Efficacy Set and using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test at a one-sided α of 0.005. Both 
confirmed and unconfirmed ORR were summarized but, for purposes of formal testing, the analysis of the 
confirmed responses was used. The stratification factors used in the test were those used for 
randomization. For the primary analysis, ORR was presented by arm, along with 95% and 99% CIs. A 
similar analysis for ORR (Triplet arm vs. Control arm) was performed on the FAS. The secondary ORR 
endpoints (including Investigator-assessed ORR) were analyzed in a similar manner based on the Phase 3 
Response Efficacy Set and the FAS. 
Progression-free survival was calculated for all patients in the FAS and summarized by treatment arm or 
SLI cohort using the Kaplan-Meier method. Progression-free survival as determined by both BICR and by 
Investigator was analyzed. For the randomized Phase 3 portion of the study, PFS by BICR was prioritized 
in the hierarchical testing, followed by PFS by Investigator assessment. Overall treatment arm estimates, 
as well as treatment arm estimates by stratum, were provided. For the primary PFS analysis, disease 
progression and death (from any cause) were considered as events. If death or disease progression was 
not observed, PFS was censored at the date of last adequate tumour assessment (i.e., at the date of last 
tumor assessment of CR, PR or stable disease) prior to cutoff date or date a subsequent therapy is 
started (e.g., systemic therapy, surgery, radiotherapy). However, if a PFS event was observed after more 
than 1 missing or inadequate tumour assessment, PFS was censored at the last adequate tumor 
assessment. If a PFS event was observed after a single missing or non-adequate tumour assessment, the 
actual date of event was used. Sensitivity analyses were performed on patients with early censoring 
because they have the potential to cause bias, as they have incomplete follow-up and their progression 
status at the data cut-off is unknown. 
The Type I error rate for the primary endpoints was controlled using a fallback procedure described by 
Wiens and Dmitrienko (2005). A one-sided α of 0.005 was assigned to the Triplet arm vs. Control arm 
ORR endpoint. The remaining 0.020 was assigned to the Triplet arm vs. Control arm OS endpoint. 
Because the p value of the Triplet arm vs. Control arm comparison of ORR at the primary analysis was < 
0.005, then the Triplet vs. Control OS comparison was assigned a total one-sided α of 0.025. 
The key secondary endpoint and 3 secondary endpoints were formally tested. To control the overall Type 
I error rate, a gatekeeping procedure using hierarchical testing was used. Because the OS of the Triplet 
arm vs. Control arm was found to be significant at the interim analysis the following tests then were 
conducted sequentially, each at the same total α assigned to the Triplet arm vs. Control arm OS 
endpoint: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/271532/2020 
Page 92/224 
 
 
  
  
1. OS of Doublet arm vs. Control arm 
2. ORR (by BICR) of Doublet arm vs. Control arm 
3. PFS (by BICR) of Triplet arm vs. Control arm 
4. PFS (by BICR) of Doublet arm vs. Control arm 
According to the original protocol, OS was the only primary endpoint and the primary analysis was 
planned to occur once at least 232 events were observed in the Triplet Arm + Control Arm and at least 
338 events were observed in the Doublet Arm + Control Arm. The study design included a nonbinding 
futility interim analysis when approximately 50% of the expected OS events in the Triplet Arm + Control 
Arm occur (i.e., 167 deaths). With protocol amendment 6, a primary objective and endpoint was added to 
the randomized portion of the study for confirmed ORR by BICR of encorafenib + binimetinib + cetuximab 
(Triplet arm) vs. irinotecan/cetuximab or FOLFIRI/cetuximab (Control arm). An initial analysis of the 
study was to be performed when all of the following criteria were met: 
•  Approximately 9 months after randomization of the 330th patient (i.e., approximately 110  
patients per arm), to allow a majority of responders among the 330 Phase 3 patients to have had 
the opportunity to be followed for approximately 6 months or longer after their first response 
•  At least 188 OS events had occurred in the Triplet and Control arms combined (i.e., 
approximately 70% information) 
•  At least 169 OS events had occurred in the Doublet and Control arms combined (i.e., 
approximately 50% information) 
The planned interim analysis of OS (Triplet arm vs. Control arm) was modified to include boundaries for 
both superiority and (non-binding) futility, and the timing of this analysis was modified to occur at the 
same time as the primary analysis of the newly added ORR endpoint. The interim analysis for superiority 
or (non-binding) futility of the Triplet arm vs. Control arm OS endpoint was performed based on all 
available data (i.e., using the FAS). Futility and superiority boundaries for both the OS interim and final 
analyses were determined using a Lan-DeMets spending function (Lan and DeMets 1983) that 
approximated O’Brien-Fleming stopping boundaries. Several measures were taken to preserve data 
blinding at the time of the Protocol amendment 6 decision for the teams involved in the decision to 
amend the protocol.

Recruitment 
Enrollment/randomization in the study was conducted as follows: 
• 
• 
The SLI cohort was enrolled between 28 October 2016 and 31 March 2017. 
The JSLI cohort was enrolled between 22 February 2018 and 27 March 2018. 
•  Randomization into the Phase 3 portion of the study was conducted between 04 May 2017 and 31 
January 2019. 
o Note: Screening at sites in the United States was closed on 15 July 2018 due to the 
relatively high number of consent withdrawals by patients randomized to the Control arm 
and the off-label availability of BRAF inhibitors and MEK inhibitors including encorafenib 
and binimetinib, which were approved for the treatment of patients with BRAF-mutant 
melanoma in June 2018. 
A summary of patient disposition by treatment group for the FAS is provided in Table 10 (data cut-off 11 
February 2019).

Conduct of the study 
The (final) protocol was subject to overall 6 amendments. 
The most relevant protocol changes occurred with version 6 changing the following (affecting the primary 
objectives and endpoints of the randomized/confirmative portion of the trial): 
Protocol Version 6.0 (dated 19 September 2018) included the following substantive changes: 
•  A primary objective and endpoint was added to the randomized portion of the study for confirmed 
ORR by BIRC of encorafenib + binimetinib + cetuximab (Triplet arm) vs. irinotecan/cetuximab or 
FOLFIRI/cetuximab (Control arm). This was to be performed when all of the following criteria 
were met: approximately 9 months after randomization of the 330th patient, when ≥ 188 OS 
events had occurred in the Triplet and Control arms combined (i.e., approximately 70% 
information), and when ≥ 169 OS events occurred in the Doublet and Control arms combined 
(i.e., approximately 50% information). This primary objective and endpoint was added because 
demonstration of a high rate of durable responses and/or a positive effect on OS could be the 
basis for marketing approval for the Triplet combination in some regions, resulting in earlier 
access for patients in this setting of high unmet need. 
Assessment report

• 
The planned interim analysis of OS (Triplet arm vs. Control arm) was modified to include 
boundaries for both superiority and (non-binding) futility, and the timing of this analysis was 
modified to occur at the same time as the primary analysis of the newly added ORR endpoint. 
•  Retrospective BICR was added for patients’ tumor imaging data to support the Phase III primary 
endpoint of confirmed ORR per BICR (Triplet arm vs. Control arm) as well as secondary efficacy 
analyses of ORR, PFS, DOR and TTR. 
A summary of protocol deviations by treatment group is provided. 
All major protocol deviation that led to exclusion were in the category of “selection criteria not met”, 
which were “not positive for BRAF V600 mutation per central assessment” and “prior treatment with any 
RAF inhibitor, MEK inhibitor, cetuximab, panitumumab or other EGFR inhibitors”.

Baseline plasma samples were available for 29 of 39 randomized patients whose central BRAF V600E 
mutation result did not confirm the local positive result. Analysis of circulating tumor DNA (Idylla™ 
ctBRAF Mutation Assay, Biocartis, Mechelen, Belgium) detected a BRAF V600E mutation in 25 of these 29 
patients (86.2%). 
As the study reached its protocol-specified limit of patients whose central BRAF V600E mutation result 
was either indeterminate or discordant with the local assay result, central laboratory confirmation of BRAF 
V600E tumour mutation status became mandatory for study eligibility with Administrative Letter dated 21 
December 2018.

The overall use of concomitant medications reflected the toxicity profiles of each treatment regimen. 
The ATC classes that were most commonly administered (> 30.0% of patients in any Phase III treatment 
arm) included: 
•  Pretreatment for cetuximab infusions/chemotherapy, allowed per protocol: glucocorticoids 
(i.e., steroids) (71.6% Triplet arm, 74.1% Doublet arm, 82.4% Control arm) and 
substituted alkylamines (i.e., antihistamines) (35.1% Triplet arm, 37.5% Doublet arm, 
39.9% Control arm), serotonin antagonist antiemetics (27.0% Triplet arm, 19.4% 
Doublet arm, 74.6% Control arm) and belladonna alkaloids, semisynthetic, quaternary 
ammonium compounds, specifically the medication of atropine (0.0% Triplet and Doublet 
arms, 31.1% Control arm). 
•  For rash: tetracyclines (54.5% Triplet arm, 32.9% Doublet arm, 49.7% Control arm). 
• 
 For pain or preexisting conditions: anilide analgesics (45.5% Triplet arm, 53.2% Doublet 
arm, 42.0% Control arm) and opium alkaloids (26.1% Triplet arm, 38.4% Doublet arm, 
31.6% Control arm). 
• 
For GI toxicities or preexisting GI conditions: proton pump inhibitors (46.4% Triplet arm, 
43.5% Doublet arm, 42.5% Control arm), antidiarrheals (41.9% Triplet arm, 20.8% 
Doublet arm, 38.3% Control arm) and propulsive medications (36.5% Triplet arm, 29.6% 
Doublet arm, 42.0% Control arm). 
Numbers analysed 
The SAP pre-specified the following analysis sets: 
Full Analysis Set (FAS) 
For patients in the CSLI, the FAS consisted of all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug and 
had at least 1 post-treatment assessment, which may have included death. 
Safety Set 
The Safety Set consisted of all patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 
post-treatment assessment, which may have included death.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/271532/2020 
Page 101/224 
 
 
  
  
 
Dose-determining Set 
The DDS included all CSLI patients from the Safety Set who either completed a minimum exposure 
requirement and had sufficient safety evaluations or experienced a DLT. 
Patients who did not experience a DLT during the first cycle were considered to have sufficient safety 
evaluations if they were observed for ≥ 28 days following the first dose, and were considered by both the 
Sponsor and Investigators to have enough safety data to conclude that a DLT did not occur. 
Safety Lead-in Efficacy Set 
The SLI Efficacy Set consisted of all CSLI patients in the FAS who were identified at screening as having a 
BRAF V600E mutation (per local or central testing). 
Phase III Response Efficacy Set 
The Phase III Response Efficacy Set consisted of the first 330 patients randomized into the Phase III 
portion of the study and any additional patients randomized on the same day as the 330th randomized 
patient. 
Per-protocol Set 
The PPS consisted of all Phase 3 patients from the FAS without any major protocol deviations (or other 
criteria that could largely impact efficacy results) and who received at least 1 dose of study drug. 
The reasons that led to exclusion of patients from the PPS are listed below: 
•  No histologically or cytologically confirmed CRC that was metastatic; 
•  Not positive for BRAF V600E mutation per central assessment; 
• 
Prior treatment with any RAF inhibitor, MEK inhibitor, cetuximab, panitumumab or other EGFR 
inhibitor; 
•  Baseline ECOG PS greater or equal to 3 (i.e., at least 2 categories worse than the defined 
inclusion criterion); 
•  Study treatment received different from treatment assigned by randomization. 
Pharmacokinetic Set 
The PK set included all patients in the Safety Set who had at least 1 post-dose blood collection for PK with 
associated bioanalytical results. Patients were analyzed according to the actual treatment and dose 
received. 
A summary of analysis sets by treatment group is provided in Table 17.

Overall survival, including the randomized Phase III primary endpoint of OS, was analyzed based on the 
FAS population in the randomized Phase III portion of the study, which included 665 patients. 
Overall response rate, including the randomized Phase 3 primary endpoint of ORR, was analysed based 
on the Phase III Response Efficacy Set of 331 patients. 
Efficacy analyses of the CSLI were performed on the SLI Efficacy Set, which included 36 patients. 
The PPS included 586 patients from the randomized Phase III FAS. 
Patients in the Safety Set were analyzed according to the study treatment they actually received. All 
treated patients in the Triplet and Doublet arms received the study treatment to which they were 
randomized, and no patients randomized to a treatment arm received a regimen for a different treatment 
arm. In the Phase III portion of the study, 34 patients were randomized but did not receive study drug (2 
patients to the Triplet arm, 4 patients to the Doublet arm, 28 patients to the Control arm). These patients 
were excluded from the Safety Set and the PPS. 
An additional 45 patients were excluded from the PPS based on the reasons summarized in Table 16.

All analyses by strata were conducted based on IWRS data used for randomization. Per IWRS, 
approximately equal numbers of patients were ECOG PS 0 and ECOG PS 1, with approximately equal 
numbers having/not having prior use of irinotecan (Table 18). A majority of patients received EU-
approved cetuximab, as US-licensed cetuximab was used at sites in only the United States and Canada. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/271532/2020 
Page 104/224 
 
 
  
  
 
 
In some cases, stratification per IWRS differed from data subsequently documented at Baseline in the 
eCRF. Discordance rates of 10.5% and 2.4% were observed for the stratification factors of ECOG PS and 
prior irinotecan use, respectively. 
There was no discordance for cetuximab source.  
Outcomes and estimation 
After testing the randomized Phase 3 primary endpoint of ORR by BICR (Triplet arm vs. Control arm), the 
primary endpoint of Triplet arm vs. Control arm OS and 4 secondary efficacy endpoints were tested using 
a gatekeeping hierarchical procedure to control the Type I error rate in the order presented in Table 20.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/271532/2020 
Page 105/224 
 
 
  
  
 
 
If any of these tests had been found to not be statistically significant, subsequent comparisons were to be 
summarized using descriptive statistics, including nominal p values. 
Additional secondary efficacy analyses of randomized Phase III data and all efficacy analyses of CSLI data 
were performed independently of the outcome of the testing described in Figure 2.

Results from the study showed that BRAF V600E-mutant patients with mCRC in the Triplet arm 
demonstrated statistically significant improvements in both primary efficacy endpoints (ORR by BICR and 
OS) over the Control arm (Table 20). These results, in turn, permitted the formal testing of the key 
secondary efficacy endpoint of OS for the Doublet arm vs. Control arm, which also achieved statistical 
significance. Each of 3 remaining secondary efficacy endpoints included in the testing hierarchy achieved 
a statistically significant improvement over the Control arm in formal testing. All comparisons of the 
Triplet and Doublet arms are descriptive and were conducted outside of the formal testing hierarchy. 
For all randomized Phase 3 patients, the median duration of potential follow-up was 7.79 months for OS 
and 5.39 months for PFS by BICR.

Sensitivity Analyses of OS, Triplet Arm vs. Control Arm 
To assess the robustness of this OS analysis, the following sensitivity analyses were performed: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/271532/2020 
Page 109/224 
 
 
  
  
 
 
•  OS, stratified test (PPS) 
•  OS, unstratified test (FAS) 
In a post hoc analysis, OS was analyzed in the Phase III Response Efficacy Set (i.e., the first 
331 patients randomized). As shown in Figure 4, an estimated 47% reduction in risk of death was 
observed for the Triplet arm compared to the Control arm (HR 0.53, 95% CI: 0.38, 0.74). The median OS 
in the Triplet arm was 4.33 months longer than in the Control arm, with median OS estimates using 
Kaplan-Meier methodology of 9.49 months (95% CI: 8.08, 11.99) in the Triplet arm and 5.16 months 
(95% CI: 4.44, 6.57) in the Control arm (p < 0.0001, stratified log-rank test). 
Using a reverse Kaplan-Meier analysis (i.e., OS events were presented as censored events and vice 
versa), the estimated median duration of potential follow-up for OS was 12.45 months (95% CI: 11.24, 
14.36) for the Triplet arm and 12.19 months (95% CI: 9.89, 14.39) for the Control arm. Therefore, data 
in patients with more mature follow-up support the conclusions reached in the primary analysis of OS and 
in prespecified sensitivity analyses.

Supportive Analysis: Multivariate Cox Regression of OS, Triplet Arm vs. Control Arm 
The effect of Baseline covariates and potential prognostic factors on OS was investigated using a 
multivariate Cox regression model stratified by the study stratification factors (ECOG PS, prior irinotecan 
use and cetuximab source). The objective of this analysis was to explore the consistency of treatment 
effect on OS after adjusting for these Baseline covariates. 
This multivariate Cox regression model demonstrated that, after adjusting for pre-specified Baseline 
covariates, the outcome of the comparison of Triplet arm vs. Control arm was consistent with the primary

OS analysis (55% reduction in the risk of death in the Triplet arm), which was nominally significant (HR 
0.45, 95% CI: 0.33, 0.61; 2-sided p value < 0.0001). 
Two pre-specified covariates also reached nominal significance: the presence of liver metastases at 
Baseline was associated with a 2.68-fold increase in the risk of death (HR 2.68, 95% CI: 1.88, 3.81; 2-
sided p value < 0.0001) and Baseline CRP > ULN was associated with a 2.70-fold increase in the risk of 
death (expressed as the inverse of HR 0.37, 95% CI: 0.27, 0.51; 2-sided p value < 0.0001). 
In addition, post hoc un-stratified univariate Cox regression analyses, for all Phase III patients in the FAS 
combined (i.e., all 3 arms combined), were conducted to investigate the relationship between OS and the 
study stratification factors (ECOG PS, prior irinotecan use and cetuximab source) and Baseline covariates, 
without including treatment effect in the model. Of the stratification factors, a Baseline ECOG PS score of 
1 was associated with a 1.78-fold increase in the risk of death (HR 1.78, 95% CI: 1.41, 2.24; 2-sided p 
value < 0.0001) and prior irinotecan use was associated with a 1.35-fold increase in the risk of death (HR 
1.35, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.69; 2-sided p value = 0.0103). 
Several Baseline covariates were strongly associated (2-sided p < 0.0001) with an increase in the risk of 
death. Baseline CRP > ULN was associated with a 3.13-fold increase in the risk of death. The presence of 
liver metastases at Baseline was associated with a 2.60-fold increase in the risk of death. Baseline CEA > 
ULN was associated with a 2.56-fold increase in the risk of death. Also, Baseline CA19-9 > ULN was 
associated with a 1.96-fold increase in the risk of death and having > 2 organs involved at Baseline was 
associated with a 1.61-fold increase in risk of death. 
Subgroup Analyses of OS, Triplet Arm vs. Control Arm 
Subgroup analyses were performed for each Baseline stratification factor and other relevant Baseline 
variables. Only analyses for which at least 10 events were available in each subgroup are discussed here. 
With the exception of the small subgroup (“BRAF mutation status [central] negative or indeterminate” 
[total n = 24; total number of events = 14], HR 1.01[95% CI: 0.34, 3.05]), all analyses demonstrated 
OS HRs in favor of the Triplet arm. The greatest difference in favor of the Triplet arm was observed in the 
subgroup with no liver metastases at Baseline (HR 0.34, 95% CI: 0.19, 0.62). The smallest differences in 
favor of the Triplet arm were observed in the overlapping subgroups of patients who were randomized to 
receive US-licensed cetuximab and patients who were randomized at sites in North America (excluding 
Mexico) (HR 0.91 [95% CI: 0.45, 1.86] for both subgroups).

The updated version of this subgroup analysis with a cut-off date 15 August 2019 is presented in figure 
2 below: 
As already mentioned, 2 patients in the Triplet arm and 28 patients in the Control arm were randomized 
but not treated. In both patients in the Triplet arm, the documented reason for not receiving study 
treatment was because of changes in the patient’s condition or development of an intercurrent illness. In 
the Control arm, the documented reason for not receiving study treatment was withdrawal of consent (21 
patients), patient decision (4 patients) and changes in patient’s condition/development of intercurrent 
illness (3 patients). Due to the small number of patients not treated in the Triplet arm, a formal 
comparison of OS between these subgroups was not performed. In the Triplet arm, the patients who were

randomized but not treated had an OS of 0.26 months and 9.26 months. The median OS for patients 
randomized but not treated in the Control arm was 7.56 months (95% CI: 4.57, 20.34). 
The CSR contains a brief description of subsequent systemic anti-cancer therapy. Accordingly, 49.3% and 
44.6% of patients in the Triplet and Control arms, respectively, used subsequent systemic anticancer 
therapy. The actual difference in use of (subsequent/post progression) anticancer therapy was slightly 
different, but the differences are actually minor. E.g., no patients in the Triplet arm and 9.2% of patients 
in the Control arm received a BRAF inhibitor plus a MEK inhibitor plus an EGFR inhibitor. 
Of the patients who were randomized but not treated, 1 of 2 patients (50%) in the Triplet arm received 
subsequent systemic anticancer therapy after study withdrawal (cetuximab, irinotecan, fluorouracil and a 
second line of systemic therapy with TAS 102). 
In the Control arm, 11 of 28 patients (39.3%) received subsequent systemic anticancer therapy; 
therapies used at the highest incidence (> 10%) were irinotecan (21.4%); fluorouracil (21.4%); 
bevacizumab (14.3%); panitumumab (14.3%); folinic acid (10.7%); oxaliplatin (10.7%) and 
investigational antineoplastic drugs (10.7%) (2 patients received PLX8394 [a BRAF inhibitor] and 1 
patient received RO6958688 [anti-CEA/CD3 bi-specific antibody])

Sensitivity Analyses of ORR by BICR, Triplet Arm vs. Control Arm 
To assess the robustness of the ORR primary analysis the following sensitivity analyses were performed: 
•  ORR unstratified test in Phase III Response Efficacy Set 
•  ORR stratified test in FAS 
•  ORR unstratified test in FAS 
•  ORR stratified test, for patients in Phase 3 Response Efficacy Set with measurable disease 
at Baseline 
These sensitivity analyses of ORR support the conclusions reached in the primary analysis, yielding 
similar ORRs and p values (Table 25). In the Triplet and Control arms, 36 of 224 patients and 35 of 221 
patients, respectively, had not been on study long enough to experience a confirmed response (i.e., a 
response at their first tumor assessment, confirmed at the scan 6 weeks later). An additional 18 patients

in each of the Triplet and Control arms had not been on study long enough to experience a response at 
their second tumor assessment, confirmed 6 weeks later. 
Supportive Analysis: Multivariate Logistic Regression of ORR by BICR, Triplet Arm vs. Control 
Arm 
The effect of Baseline characteristics and potential prognostic factors on ORR by BICR in the Phase III 
Response Efficacy Set was investigated using a multivariate logistic regression model stratified by the 
study stratification factors (ECOG PS, prior irinotecan use and cetuximab source). The objective of this 
analysis was to explore the consistency of treatment effect on ORR by BICR after adjusting for main 
prognostic factors. 
To provide a comparison to this stratified multivariate logistic regression model, a separate stratified 
univariate model looking only at treatment group (Triplet arm vs. Control arm) was also assessed. The 
stratified univariate model showed that patients in the Triplet arm had a 19.10-fold increased odds (95% 
CI: 4.41, 82.80) of responding compared to patients in the Control arm. 
The stratified multivariate logistic regression model demonstrated that, after adjusting for pre-specified 
Baseline covariates, the outcome of the Triplet arm vs. Control arm comparison was consistent with the 
stratified univariate model (odds ratio 25.26 [95% CI: 5.38, 118.7; 2-sided p value < 0.0001],). Of all 
the pre-specified covariates that reached nominal significance in the multivariate model, treatment group 
had the largest effect. 
Patients with liver metastases at Baseline had decreased odds of responding compared to patients 
without liver metastases (odds ratio 0.22 [95% CI: 0.07, 0.69; 2-sided p value = 0.0087]), and patients 
with 1 metastatic site had increased odds of responding compared to patients with ≥ 2 metastatic sites 
(odds ratio 3.89 [95% CI: 1.13, 13.39; 2-sided p value = 0.0314]). 
In addition, post hoc un-stratified univariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to investigate 
the effect of study stratification factors (ECOG PS, prior irinotecan use and cetuximab source) and

Baseline characteristics and potential prognostic factors in the Phase 3 Response Efficacy Set, without 
including treatment effect in the model. None of the stratification factors were found to have a significant 
effect on ORR. Two pre-specified Baseline covariates were associated with decreased odds of responding 
to treatment: Baseline CRP and the number of prior regimens for metastatic disease. Patients with 
Baseline CRP > ULN had decreased odds of responding (odds ratio 0.44 [95% CI: 0.23, 0.83; 2-sided p 
value = 0.0120]), as did patients with ≥ 2 prior regimens for metastatic disease (odds ratio 0.47 [95% 
CI: 0.24, 0.91; 2-sided p value = 0.0256]). 
Subgroup Analyses of ORR by BICR, Triplet Arm vs. Control Arm 
Subgroup analyses were performed for each Baseline stratification factor and other relevant Baseline 
variables. Because there were 2 patients in the Control arm with confirmed responses by BICR in the 
Phase 3 Response Efficacy Set, this discussion focuses on 5 clinically relevant subgroups in the Triplet 
arm: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
In the Triplet arm, patients who had progressed after 1 prior regimen for metastatic disease had 
a confirmed ORR of 34.3% (23 of 67 patients, 95% CI: 23.2, 46.9), compared to 13.6% (6 of 44 
patients, 95% CI: 5.2, 27.4) in patients who had progressed after ≥ 2 prior regimens for 
metastatic disease. 
In the Triplet arm, patients with ≤ 2 organs involved at Baseline had a confirmed ORR of 24.1% 
(14 of 58 patients, 95% CI: 13.9, 37.2), compared to 28.3% (15 of 53 patients, 95% CI: 16.8, 
42.3) in patients with ≥ 3 organs involved at Baseline. 
In the Triplet arm, patients with a Baseline CEA ≤ ULN had a confirmed ORR of 38.1% (8 of 21 
patients, 95% CI: 18.1, 61.6), compared to 23.3% (21 of 90 patients, 95% CI: 15.1, 33.4) in 
patients with a Baseline CEA > ULN. 
In the Triplet arm, patients with a Baseline CRP ≤ ULN had a confirmed ORR of 33.3% (19 of 57 
patients, 95% CI: 21.4, 47.1), compared to 18.4% (9 of 49 patients, 95% CI: 8.8, 32.0) in 
patients with a Baseline CRP > ULN. 
• In the Triplet arm, patients with no liver metastases at Baseline had a confirmed ORR of 41.5% 
(17 of 41 patients, 95% CI: 26.3, 57.9), compared to 17.1% (12 of 70 patients, 95% CI: 9.2, 
28.0) in patients with liver metastases at Baseline.

DOR, Triplet Arm vs. Control Arm 
The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median DOR by BICR in the Phase 3 Response Efficacy Set, calculated for 
confirmed responses in the Triplet arm, was 4.80 months (95% CI: 2.96, 9.69). For an updated analysis 
see preceeding table updated ORR analysis. Of the 2 patients in the Control arm with confirmed 
responses, 1 patient had a DOR of 2.56 months; the other patient’s DOR was 6.93 months. In the Triplet 
arm, individual DORs ranged from 1.41 months to 15.01 months, with 24.1% of confirmed responders (7 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/271532/2020

of 29) having a DOR by BICR of ≥ 6 months. At the data cut-off date, 13.8% of confirmed responders (4 
of 29) in the Triplet arm had a DOR of < 6 months with responses ongoing (5.55 months, 3.19 months, 
1.41 months and 5.59 months), compared to 0% of confirmed responders in the Control arm. 
The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median DOR by Investigator in the Phase 3 Response Efficacy Set, 
calculated for confirmed responses, was similar to the by BICR result in the Triplet arm: 
4.80 months (95% CI: 3.29, 6.57). Of the 4 patients in the Control arm with confirmed responses, 
patients had DORs of 2.56 months, 5.75 months, 8.48 months and 5.55 months. 
Similarly, Kaplan-Meier estimates of median DOR by BICR and Investigator in the FAS were calculated for 
confirmed responses. The results are consistent with results observed using the Phase 3 Response 
Efficacy Set. 
TTR, Triplet Arm vs. Control Arm 
The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median TTR by BICR in the Phase 3 Response Efficacy Set, calculated for 
patients with confirmed responses, was 1.48 months in the Triplet arm (95% CI: 1.41, 2.00). For patients 
in the Triplet arm with confirmed CRs, the TTRs were 1.41, 1.58, 16.56 and 1.41 months. Of the 2 
patients in the Control arm with confirmed responses, 1 patient had a TTR of 1.41 months; the other 
patient’s TTR was 1.45 months. 
The time to most responses by BICR in the Phase 3 Response Efficacy Set corresponded with the first 
post-Baseline response assessment at 6 weeks (± 7 days) after randomization. In the Triplet arm, 69.0% 
of confirmed responses (20/29) were based on the first tumor assessment, 24.1% (7/29) were based on 
the second tumor assessment and 6.9% (2/29) were based on the third or subsequent tumor 
assessment. In the Control arm, 100.0% of confirmed responses (2/2) were based on the first tumor 
assessment. 
PFS, Triplet Arm vs. Control Arm 
Estimates of median PFS by Investigator assessment in the FAS were comparable to the PFS by BICR 
results (HR 0.37, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.48). The Triplet arm had a median PFS that was 2.89 months longer 
than that in the Control arm (Triplet arm 4.47 months [95% CI: 4.24, 5.36] and Control arm 1.58 
months [95% CI: 1.51, 2.07], stratified log-rank test p < 0.0001).

To assess the robustness of the PFS analysis, the following sensitivity analyses of PFS by BICR were 
performed: 
•

PFS (PPS) 
The distribution of PFS in FAS was compared between the treatment arms using unstratified 
analyses. 
The analyses for PFS were repeated to assess time evaluation bias, whereby event and censoring 
dates that did not occur within the protocol-specified schedule window were moved to either the 
previous or the next scheduled assessment. 
“Actual event” analysis for PFS with a censoring rule that included a PFS event even if the event 
was recorded after 2 or more missing tumor assessments. 
“Backdating” analysis for PFS with a censoring rule that backdated events occurring after 1 or 
more missing tumor assessments. 
“Further anticancer therapy” analysis for PFS including tumor assessments after initiation of 
subsequent anticancer therapy. 
The analyses for PFS were repeated to assess early censoring (i.e., censoring > 2 months prior to 
the data cutoff date) and the impact of any imbalances in censoring distribution. 
Results of these sensitivity analyses for PFS by BICR are consistent with the primary PFS analysis of 
Triplet arm vs. Control arm, yielding similar HRs (0.36 to 0.42), median PFS values and p values. 
sensitivity analyses for PFS by BICR in patients with early censoring also yielded HRs (0.37 to 0.41) and p 
values similar to those in the primary analysis. 
Supportive Analysis: Multivariate Cox Regression of PFS, Triplet Arm vs. Control Arm 
The effect of Baseline covariates and potential prognostic factors on PFS by BICR in the FAS was 
investigated using a multivariate Cox regression model stratified by the study stratification factors (ECOG

PS, prior irinotecan use and cetuximab source). The objective of this analysis was to explore the 
consistency of treatment effect on PFS after adjusting for these Baseline covariates. 
This multivariate Cox regression model demonstrated that, after adjusting for pre-specified Baseline 
covariates, the outcome of the comparison of Triplet arm vs. Control arm was consistent with the primary 
PFS analysis (71% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in the Triplet arm). The difference 
was nominally significant (HR 0.29, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.38; 2-sided p value < 0.0001). 
Two pre-specified covariates reached nominal significance: 
the presence of liver metastases at Baseline and Baseline CRP. The presence of liver metastases at 
Baseline was associated with a 4.17-fold increase in the risk of disease progression or death (HR 4.17, 
95% CI: 2.92, 5.95; 2-sided p value < 0.0001). Baseline CRP > ULN was associated with a 1.47-fold 
increase in the risk of disease progression or death (expressed as the inverse of HR 0.68, 95% CI: 0.51, 
0.91; 2-sided p value = 0.0095). 
In addition, post hoc unstratified univariate Cox regression analyses, for all Phase 3 patients in the FAS 
combined (i.e., all 3 arms combined), were conducted to investigate the relationship between PFS and 
the study stratification factors (ECOG PS, prior irinotecan use and cetuximab source) and Baseline 
covariates, without including treatment effect in the model. Of the stratification factors, a Baseline ECOG 
PS score of 1 was associated with a 1.37-fold increase in the risk of disease progression or death (HR 
1.37, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.68; 2-sided p value = 0.0024). Prior irinotecan use was associated with a 1.25-fold 
increase in the risk of disease progression or death (HR 1.25, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.53; 2-sided p value = 
0.0319). 
Several Baseline covariates were strongly associated (2-sided p < 0.0001) with an increase in the risk of 
disease progression or death. The presence of liver metastases at Baseline was associated with a 2.46-
fold increase in the risk of disease progression or death (HR 2.46, 95% CI: 1.95, 3.09). Baseline CRP > 
ULN was associated with a 2.00-fold increase in the risk of disease progression or death (expressed as 
the inverse of HR 0.50, 95% CI: 0.41, 0.62). Baseline CEA > ULN was associated with a 1.85-fold 
increase in the risk of disease progression or death (expressed as the inverse of HR 0.54, 95% CI: 0.42, 
0.71). Also, Baseline CA19-9 > ULN was associated with a 1.64-fold increase in the risk of disease 
progression or death (expressed as the inverse of HR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.48, 0.77). 
Subgroup Analyses of PFS, Triplet Arm vs. Control Arm 
Subgroup analyses were performed for each Baseline stratification factor and other relevant Baseline 
variables (Table 14.2-3.10). Only analyses for which at least 10 events were available in each subgroup 
are discussed here. All analyses demonstrated PFS HRs in favor of the Triplet arm. The greatest 
differences in favor of the Triplet arm were observed in subgroups with liver metastases at Baseline (HR 
0.28, 95% CI: 0.21, 0.38), tumor partly resected or unresected (HR 0.29, 95% CI: 0.19, 0.43), and prior 
irinotecan use (HR 0.29, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.42). The smallest difference in favor of the Triplet arm was 
observed in the subgroup of Asian patients (HR 0.51, 95% CI: 0.25, 1.03). 
Randomized Phase 3: Doublet Arm vs. Control Arm 
OS, Doublet Arm vs. Control Arm (Key Secondary Endpoint) 
Because the OS primary endpoint of Triplet arm vs. Control arm was found to be significant, the key 
secondary efficacy endpoint of OS, Doublet arm vs. Control arm was formally tested in the FAS, as pre-
specified in the SAP. As of the data cut-off date, 93 deaths were observed in the 220 (42.3%) patients 
randomized to the Doublet arm and 114 deaths were observed in the 221 (51.6%) patients randomized

to the Control arm (Table 29). Using a Lan-DeMets α spending function that approximates O’Brien-
Fleming stopping boundaries, the critical p value with 61% information (i.e., 207 patient deaths out of the 
planned 338 for the final analysis) was p = 0.0042.

Sensitivity Analyses of OS, Doublet Arm vs. Control Arm 
To assess the robustness of this OS analysis, the following sensitivity analyses were performed: 
•  OS, stratified test (PPS) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/271532/2020 
Page 125/224 
 
 
  
  
 
 
•  OS, unstratified test (FAS) 
These pre-specified sensitivity analyses of OS support the conclusions reached in the primary analysis, 
yielding similar HRs (0.58 to 0.61), median OS values and p values (Table 31). 
In a post hoc analysis, OS was analyzed in the Phase 3 Response Efficacy Set (i.e., the first 331 patients 
randomized). As shown Figure 10, an estimated 34% reduction in risk of death was observed for the 
Doublet arm compared to the Control arm (HR 0.66, 95% CI: 0.48, 0.92). The median OS in the Doublet 
arm was 3.12 months longer than in the Control arm, with median OS estimates using Kaplan-Meier 
methodology of 8.28 months (95% CI: 6.24, 10.68) in the Doublet arm and 5.16 months (95% CI: 4.44, 
6.57) in the Control arm (p = 0.0074, stratified log-rank test). 
Therefore, data in patients with more mature follow-up support the conclusions reached in the primary 
analysis of OS and in prespecified sensitivityanalyses

Supportive Analysis: Multivariate Cox Regression of OS, Doublet Arm vs. Control Arm 
The effect of Baseline covariates and potential prognostic factors on OS was investigated using a 
multivariate Cox regression model stratified by the study stratification factors (ECOG PS, prior irinotecan 
use and cetuximab source). The objective of this analysis was to explore the consistency of treatment 
effect on OS after adjusting for these Baseline covariates. 
This multivariate Cox regression model demonstrated that, after adjusting for pre-specified Baseline 
covariates, the outcome of the comparison of Doublet arm vs. Control arm was consistent with the 
primary OS analysis (51% reduction in the risk of death in the Doublet arm), which was nominally 
significant (HR 0.49, 95% CI: 0.36, 0.67; 2-sided p value < 0.0001). 
Subgroup Analyses of OS, Doublet Arm vs. Control Arm 
Subgroup analyses were performed for each Baseline stratification factor and other relevant Baseline 
variables.  
Only analyses for which at least 10 events were available in each subgroup are discussed here. 
With the exception of the overlapping subgroups of patients randomized to receive US-licensed cetuximab 
source and patients randomized at sites in North America (excluding Mexico) (HR 1.15 [95% CI: 0.57, 
2.32] for both subgroups) and unknown MSI status (HR 1.18, 95% CI: 0.64, 2.14), all analyses 
demonstrated OS HRs in favor of the Doublet arm. 
The greatest differences in favor of the Doublet arm were observed in the subgroup of patients with ≤ 2 
organs involved at Baseline (HR 0.43, 95% CI: 0.28, 0.65), patients with MSI normal status (HR 0.45, 
95% CI: 0.32, 0.63), and patients at sites in Europe (HR 0.45, 95% CI: 0.32, 0.64).

Subsequent Systemic Anticancer Therapy, Doublet Arm vs. Control Arm 
Of the patients who were discontinued from treatment or were not treated (142 Doublet, 184 Control; 
Table 10 above), 43.0% and 44.6% of patients in the Doublet and Control arms, respectively, used 
subsequent systemic anticancer therapy. 
In the Doublet arm, subsequent systemic therapies used at the highest incidence (> 10%) were 
irinotecan (25.4%), flourouracil (22.5%) and folinic acid (12.7%). 
In the Control arm, subsequent systemic therapies used at the highest incidence (> 10%) were 
fluorouracil (18.5%), irinotecan (16.8%), cetuximab (13.6%), oxaliplatin (10.3%) and vemurafenib 
(10.3%). 
Notably, a lower percentage of patients in the Doublet arm than in the Control arm received subsequent 
therapy with a protein kinase inhibitor (7.0% and 17.9%, respectively).  
Subsequent Systemic Anticancer Therapy in Patients Randomized but not Treated, Doublet 
Arm vs. Control Arm 
Of the patients who were randomized but not treated, no patient in the Doublet arm and 11 of 28 
patients (39.3%) in the Control arm used subsequent systemic anticancer therapy after study withdrawal. 
In the Control arm, therapies used at the highest incidence (> 10%) were irinotecan (21.4%); 
fluorouracil (21.4%); bevacizumab (14.3%); panitumumab (14.3%); folinic acid (10.7%); oxaliplatin 
(10.7%) and investigational antineoplastic drugs (10.7%) (2 patients received PLX8394 [a BRAF 
inhibitor] and 1 patient received RO6958688 [anti-CEA/CD3]). Subsequent use of a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor 
was reported in 3.6% of patients in the Control arm. Notably, some patients in the Control arm who were 
not treated received subsequent combination treatment with a BRAF inhibitor plus a MEK inhibitor plus an 
EGFR inhibitor. 
ORR, Doublet Arm vs. Control Arm 
The secondary efficacy endpoint of Doublet arm vs. Control arm ORR by BICR was also formally tested, as 
all previous endpoints in the hierarchy were statistically significant.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/271532/2020 
Page 128/224 
 
 
  
  
The pattern of confirmed ORR by Investigator assessment in the Phase III Efficacy Response Set is similar 
to results observed when evaluated by BICR, though the confirmed ORR in the Doublet arm was slightly 
lower (Doublet: 15.9% [95% CI: 9.7, 24.0]; Control: 3.7% [95% CI: 1.0, 9.3]; stratified odds ratio 5.04 
[95% CI: 1.63, 15.56; p = 0.0011], Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test). Confirmed CR by Investigator 
assessment was observed in 1.8% and 0% of patients in the Doublet and Control arms, respectively. 
Nine patients (8.0%) in the Doublet arm were classified as confirmed objective responses by BICR and as 
no confirmed objective responses by Investigator assessment. The Investigator assessments in all 9 
patients reported tumor regressions that did not reach criteria for response. Four patients (3.5%) in the 
Doublet arm were classified as confirmed objective responses by Investigator assessment and as no 
confirmed objective responses by BICR. Two of these 4 patients had an unconfirmed PR (classified as 
stable disease) by BICR. No patients in the Doublet arm were considered to be unevaluable by BICR 
assessment. In the Control arm, 2 patients (1.9%) were classified as confirmed objective responses by 
Investigator and as no confirmed objective responses by BICR. All other assessments of confirmed 
objective response by BICR in the Phase 3 Efficacy Set were concordant. 
The concordance between Investigator and BICR assessments of overall response in the FAS is similar to 
that observed in the Phase III Response Efficacy Set. 
For reasons of completeness, updated analysis of ORR (and DOR) are added here as follows:

Sensitivity Analyses of ORR by BICR, Doublet Arm vs. Control Arm 
To assess the robustness of the ORR Doublet arm vs. Control arm analysis the following sensitivity 
analyses were performed: 
•  ORR unstratified test in Phase 3 Response Efficacy Set 
•  ORR stratified test in FAS 
•  ORR unstratified test in FAS 
•  ORR stratified test, for patients in Phase 3 Response Efficacy Set with measurable disease 
at Baseline 
These sensitivity analyses of ORR support the conclusions reached in the primary analysis, yielding 
similar ORRs and p values (Table 33).

Supportive Analysis: Multivariate Logistic Regression of ORR by BICR, Doublet Arm vs. Control 
Arm 
The effect of Baseline characteristics and potential prognostic factors on ORR by BICR in the Phase III 
Response Efficacy Set was investigated using a multivariate logistic regression model stratified by the 
study stratification factors (ECOG PS, prior irinotecan use and cetuximab source). The objective of this 
analysis was to explore the consistency of treatment effect on ORR by BICR after adjusting for main 
prognostic factors. 
To provide a comparison to this stratified multivariate logistic regression model, a separate stratified 
univariate model looking only at treatment group (Doublet arm vs. Control arm) was also assessed. The 
stratified univariate model showed that patients in the Doublet arm had a 13.72-fold increased odds 
(95% CI: 3.15, 59.80) of responding compared to patients in the Control arm. 
The stratified multivariate logistic regression model demonstrated that, after adjusting for pre-specified 
Baseline covariates, the outcome of the Doublet arm vs. Control arm comparison was consistent with the 
stratified univariate model (odds ratio 15.74 [95% CI: 3.44, 72.06; 2-sided p value = 0.0004],). No other 
prespecified covariates were found to have a significant effect on ORR by BICR. 
Subgroup Analyses of ORR by BICR, Doublet Arm vs. Control Arm 
Subgroup analyses were performed for each Baseline stratification factor and other relevant Baseline 
variables. Because there were 2 patients in the Control arm with confirmed responses by BICR in the 
Phase III Response Efficacy Set, this discussion focuses on 5 clinically relevant subgroups in the Doublet 
arm: 
• 
In the Doublet arm, patients who had progressed after 1 prior regimen for metastatic 
disease had a confirmed ORR of 22.4% (17 of 76 patients, 95% CI: 13.6, 33.4), 
compared to 16.2% (6 of 37 patients, 95% CI: 6.2, 32.0) in patients who had progressed 
after ≥ 2 prior regimens for metastatic disease. 
• 
In the Doublet arm, patients with ≤ 2 organs involved at Baseline had a confirmed ORRof 
29.3% (17 of 58 patients, 95% CI: 18.1, 42.7), compared to 10.9% (6 of 55 patients, 
95% CI: 4.1, 22.2) in patients with ≥ 3 organs involved at Baseline. 
• 
 In the Doublet arm, patients with a Baseline CEA ≤ ULN had a confirmed ORR of 26.5% 
(9 of 34 patients, 95% CI: 12.9, 44.4), compared to 17.7% (14 of 79 patients, 95% CI: 
10.0, 27.9) in patients with a Baseline CEA > ULN. 
• 
In the Doublet arm, patients with a Baseline CRP ≤ ULN had a confirmed ORR of 27.7% 
(18 of 65 patients, 95% CI: 17.3, 40.2), compared to 10.9% (5 of 46 patients, 95% CI: 
3.6, 23.6) in patients with a Baseline CRP > ULN. 
• 
In the Doublet arm, patients with no liver metastases at Baseline had a confirmed ORR of 
20.0% (8 of 40 patients, 95% CI: 9.1, 35.6), compared to 20.5% (15 of 73 patients, 
95% CI: 12.0, 31.6) in patients with liver metastases at Baseline.  
DOR, Doublet Arm vs. Control Arm 
The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median DOR by BICR in the Phase 3 Response Efficacy Set, calculated for 
confirmed responses in the Doublet arm, was 6.06 months (95% CI: 4.07, 8.28). Of the 2 patients in the 
Control arm with confirmed responses, 1 patient had a DOR of 2.56 months; the other patient’s DOR was 
6.93 months.

TTR, Doublet Arm vs. Control Arm 
The median TTR by BICR in the Phase 3 Response Efficacy Set, calculated for patients with confirmed 
responses, was 1.54 months in the Doublet arm (95% CI: 1.41, 1.64). For patients in the Doublet arm 
with confirmed CRs, the TTRs were 1.31, 1.58, 1.71, 1.48, 1.48 and 4.17 months. Of the 2 patients in the 
Control arm with confirmed responses, 1 patient had a TTR of 1.41 months; the other patient’s TTR was 
1.45 months. 
The time to most responses by BICR in the Phase 3 Response Efficacy Set corresponded with the first 
post-Baseline response assessment at 6 weeks (± 7 days) after randomization.

Sensitivity Analyses of PFS, Doublet Arm vs. Control Arm 
To assess the robustness of the PFS analysis, the following sensitivity analyses of PFS by BICR were 
performed: 
•  PFS (PPS) 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/271532/2020 
Page 133/224 
 
 
  
  
 
•  The distribution of PFS in FAS was compared between the treatment arms using 
unstratified analyses. 
•  The analyses for PFS were repeated to assess time evaluation bias, whereby event and 
censoring dates that did not occur within the protocol-specified schedule window were 
moved to either the previous or the next scheduled assessed, as outlined in the SAP. 
• 
“Actual event” analysis for PFS with a censoring rule that included a PFS event even if the 
event was recorded after 2 or more missing tumour assessments. 
• 
“Backdating” analysis for PFS with a censoring rule that backdated events occurring after 
1 or more missing tumour assessments. 
• 
“Further anticancer therapy” analysis for PFS including tumour assessments after 
initiation of subsequent anticancer therapy. 
•  The analyses for PFS were repeated to assess early censoring (i.e., censoring > 2 months 
prior to the data cut-off date) and the impact of any imbalances in censoring distribution. 
Results of these sensitivity analyses for PFS by BICR are consistent with the primary PFS analysis of 
Doublet arm vs. Control arm, yielding similar HRs (0.40 to 0.46), median PFS values and p values. 
Sensitivity analyses for PFS by BICR in patients with early censoring also yielded HRs (0.38 to 0.41) and 
p values similar to those in the primary analysis. 
Supportive Analysis: Multivariate Cox Regression of PFS, Doublet Arm vs. Control Arm 
The effect of Baseline covariates and potential prognostic factors on PFS by BICR in the FAS was 
investigated using a multivariate Cox regression model stratified by the study stratification factors (ECOG 
PS, prior irinotecan use and cetuximab source). The objective of this analysis was to explore the 
consistency of treatment effect on PFS after adjusting for these Baseline covariates. 
This multivariate Cox regression model demonstrated that, after adjusting for pre-specified Baseline 
covariates, the outcome of the comparison of Doublet arm vs. Control arm was consistent with the 
primary PFS analysis (67% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in the Doublet arm), 
which was nominally significant (HR 0.33, 95% CI: 0.25, 0.44; 2-sided p value < 0.0001). Two pre-
specified covariates reached nominal significance: the presence of liver metastases at Baseline and 
Baseline CRP. 
The presence of liver metastases at Baseline was associated with a 2.58-fold increase in the risk of 
disease progression or death. 
Baseline CRP > ULN was associated with a 1.61-fold increase in the risk of disease progression or death. 
Subgroup Analyses of PFS, Doublet Arm vs. Control Arm 
Subgroup analyses were performed for each Baseline stratification factor and other relevant Baseline 
variables. Only analyses for which at least 10 events were available in each subgroup are discussed here. 
All analyses demonstrated PFS HRs in favor of the Doublet arm. 
The greatest differences in favour of the Doublet arm were observed in subgroups with liver metastases 
at Baseline (HR 0.28, 95% CI: 0.20, 0.38) and a Baseline ECOG PS of 0 (HR 0.32, 95% CI: 0.22, 0.48). 
The smallest differences in favor of the Doublet arm was observed in subgroups with a Baseline ECOG PS 
of 1 (HR 0.51, 95% CI: 0.37, 0.72) and patients at sites in rest of world (i.e., outside of the US, Canada 
and the EU) (HR 0.51, 95% CI: 0.30, 0.85).

•  OS, stratified test (PPS) 
•  OS, unstratified test (FAS) 
These pre-specified sensitivity analyses of OS support the conclusions reached in the primary analysis, 
yielding similar HRs (0.75 to 0.87), median OS values and p values (Table 38). 
In a post hoc analysis, OS was analyzed in the Phase 3 Response Efficacy Set (i.e., the first 331 patients 
randomized). As shown in Figure 15, an estimated 26% reduction in risk of death was observed for the 
Triplet arm compared to the Doublet arm (HR 0.74, 95% CI: 0.53, 1.04). The median OS estimates using 
Kaplan-Meier methodology were 9.49 months (95% CI: 8.08, 11.99) in the Triplet arm compared to 8.28 
months (95% CI: 6.24, 10.68) in the Doublet arm (p = 0.0407, stratified log-rank test).  
Using a reverse Kaplan-Meier analysis (i.e., OS events were presented as censored events and vice 
versa), the estimated median duration of potential follow-up was 12.45 months (95% CI: 11.24, 14.36) 
in the Triplet arm and 12.71 months (95% CI: 11.20, 14.98) for the Doublet arm. These results support 
what was found in the primary analysis of OS, as well as in prespecified sensitivity analyses.

Supportive Analysis: Multivariate Cox Regression of OS, Triplet Arm vs. Doublet Arm 
The effect of Baseline covariates and potential prognostic factors on OS was investigated using a 
multivariate Cox regression model stratified by the study stratification factors (ECOG PS, prior irinotecan 
use and cetuximab source). The objective of this analysis was to explore the consistency of treatment 
effect on OS after adjusting for these Baseline covariates. 
After adjusting for pre-specified Baseline covariates, the multivariate Cox regression model found a 25% 
reduction in risk of death in the Triplet arm compared to the Doublet arm (HR 0.75, 95% CI: 0.55, 1.03; 
2-sided p value = 0.0754).  
The pre-specified covariate with the largest effect on OS was Baseline CRP > ULN, which was associated 
with a 3.13-fold increase in the risk of death (HR 0.32, 95% CI: 0.23, 0.44; 2-sided p value < 0.0001). 
The presence of liver metastases at Baseline was associated with a 2.35-fold increase in the risk of death 
(HR 2.35, 95% CI: 1.60, 3.46; 2-sided p value < 0.0001). In addition, right-sided tumors were 
associated with a 1.92-fold increase in the risk of death compared to left-sided tumors (HR 0.52, 95% CI: 
0.36, 0.74; 2-sided p value = 0.0004). 
Subgroup Analyses of OS, Triplet Arm vs. Doublet Arm 
Subgroup analyses were performed for each Baseline stratification factor and other relevant Baseline 
variables. Only analyses for which at least 10 events were available in each subgroup are discussed here. 
Twenty-seven of the 31 subgroup analyses with at least 10 events in each subgroup demonstrated OS 
HRs that favored the Triplet arm. The greatest difference in favor of the Triplet arm was observed in the 
subgroup with ≥ 3 organs involved at Baseline (HR 0.58, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.86). 
Four of the 31 subgroup analyses with at least 10 events in each subgroup did not demonstrate OS HRs

location, and ≤ 2 organs involved at Baseline). However, the CIs for all HRs > 1.0 also included lower 
bounds < 1.0.

Sensitivity Analyses of ORR by BICR, Triplet Arm vs. Doublet Arm 
To assess the robustness of the ORR Triplet arm vs. Doublet arm analysis the following sensitivity 
analyses were performed: 
•  ORR un-stratified test in Phase 3 Response Efficacy Set 
•  ORR stratified test in FAS 
•  ORR un-stratified test in FAS 
•  ORR stratified test, for patients in Phase 3 Response Efficacy Set with measurable disease 
at Baseline 
These sensitivity analyses yielded ORR values similar to what was found in the primary analysis. The 
largest differences in ORR between the Triplet and Doublet arms were observed in the FAS (stratified and 
un-stratified) (Table 40).  
Supportive Analysis: Multivariate Logistic Regression of ORR by BICR, Triplet Arm vs. Doublet 
Arm 
The effect of Baseline characteristics and potential prognostic factors on ORR by BICR in the Phase III 
Response Efficacy Set was investigated using a multivariate logistic regression model stratified by the 
study stratification factors (ECOG PS, prior irinotecan use and cetuximab source). The objective of this 
analysis was to explore the consistency of treatment effect on ORR by BICR after adjusting for main 
prognostic factors. 
To provide a comparison to this stratified multivariate logistic regression model, a separate stratified 
univariate model looking only at treatment group (Triplet arm vs. Doublet arm) was also assessed. The 
stratified univariate model showed that patients in the Triplet arm had a 1.32-fold increased odds (95% 
CI: 0.70, 2.50) of responding compared to patients in the Doublet arm. 
The stratified multivariate logistic regression model demonstrated that, after adjusting for pre-specified 
Baseline covariates, the outcome of the Triplet arm vs. Doublet arm comparison was consistent with the 
stratified univariate model (odds ratio 1.53 [95% CI: 0.76, 3.08; 2-sided p value = 0.2308]). 
Assessment report

Patients with a Baseline CRP ≤ ULN had increased odds of responding compared to patients with a 
Baseline CRP > ULN (odds ratio 2.49 [95% CI: 1.11, 5.57; 2-sided p value = 0.0262]). 
Subgroup Analyses of ORR by BICR, Triplet Arm vs. Doublet Arm 
Subgroup analyses were performed for each Baseline stratification factor and other relevant Baseline 
variables. 
Of the 29 subgroup analyses with at least 5 responders in each subgroup, 23 point estimates for 
confirmed ORR favored the Triplet arm and 4 point estimates for confirmed ORR favored the Doublet arm. 
The greatest differences in favor of the Triplet arm (≥ 10% higher ORR than in the Doublet arm) were 
observed in the following subgroups: 
•  Baseline ECOG PS of 1, 
• 
• 
• 
patients who had progressed after 1 prior regimen for metastatic disease, 
patients aged ≥ 65 years, 
patients with ≥ 3 organs involved at Baseline, 
•  Baseline CEA ≤ ULN,and 
•  no liver metastases at Baseline. 
The subgroups with differences in favor of the Doublet arm (all ≤ 5% higher than the estimates in the 
Triplet arm) were 
•  ECOG PS of 0, 
• 
• 
• 
patients who had progressed after ≥ 2 prior regimens for metastatic disease, 
patients with ≤ 2 organs involved at Baseline, and 
patients with liver metastases at Baseline. 
Of the 29 subgroup analyses with at least 5 responders in each subgroup, 
2 point estimates for confirmed ORR differed by < 1%: patients aged < 65 years and patients 
with left-sided tumors. 
Comparisons of ORR in 5 clinically relevant subgroups are provided here for the Triplet and Doublet arms. 
In patients who had progressed after 1 prior regimen for metastatic disease, the ORR was 34.3% (23 of 
67 patients, 95% CI: 23.2, 46.9) in the Triplet arm and 22.4% (17 of 76 patients, 95% CI: 13.6, 33.4) in 
the Doublet arm. In patients who had progressed after ≥ 2 prior regimens for metastatic disease, the 
ORR was 13.6% (6 of 44 patients, 95% CI: 5.2, 27.4) in the Triplet arm and 16.2% (6 of 37 patients, 
95% CI: 6.2, 32.0) in the Doublet arm. In patients with ≤ 2 organs involved at Baseline, the ORR was 
24.1% (14 of 58 patients, 95% CI:13.9, 37.2) in the Triplet arm and 29.3% (17 of 58 patients, 95% CI: 
18.1, 42.7) in the Doublet arm. In patients with ≥ 3 organs involved at Baseline, the ORR was 28.3% (15 
of 53 patients, 95% CI: 16.8, 42.3) in the Triplet arm and 10.9% (6 of 55 patients, 95% CI: 4.1, 22.2) in 
the Doublet arm. 
In patients with a Baseline CEA ≤ ULN, the ORR was 38.1% (8 of 21 patients, 95% CI: 18.1,61.6) in the 
Triplet arm and 26.5% (9 of 34 patients, 95% CI: 12.9, 44.4) in the Doublet arm. In patients with a 
Baseline CEA > ULN, the ORR was 23.3% (21 of 90 patients, 95% CI: 15.1, 33.4) in the Triplet arm and 
17.7% (14 of 79 patients, 95% CI: 10.0, 27.9) in the Doublet arm. In patients with a Baseline CRP ≤ 
ULN, the ORR was 33.3% (19 of 57 patients, 95% CI: 21.4, 47.1) in the Triplet arm and 27.7% (18 of 65 
patients, 95% CI: 17.3, 40.2) in the Doublet arm. In patients with a Baseline CRP > ULN, the ORR was

18.4% (9 of 49 patients, 95% CI: 8.8, 32.0) in the Triplet arm and 10.9% (5 of 46 patients, 95% CI: 
3.6, 23.6) in the Doublet arm. 
In patients with no liver metastases at Baseline, the ORR was 41.5% (17 of 41 patients, 95% CI: 26.3, 
57.9) in the Triplet arm and 20.0% (8 of 40 patients, 95% CI: 9.1, 35.6) in the Doublet arm. In patients 
with liver metastases at Baseline, the ORR was 17.1% (12 of 70 patients, 95% CI: 9.2, 28.0) in the 
Triplet arm and 20.5% (15 of 73 patients, 95% CI: 12.0, 31.6) in the Doublet arm. 
DOR, Triplet Arm vs. Doublet Arm 
Kaplan-Meier estimates of median DOR by BICR in the Phase 3 Response Efficacy Set, calculated for 
confirmed responses, were 4.80 months in the Triplet arm (95% CI: 2.96, 9.69) and 6.06 months in the 
Doublet arm (95% CI: 4.07, 8.28). In the Triplet arm, individual DORs ranged from 1.41 months to 15.01 
months. In the Doublet arm, individual DORs ranged from 1.54 months to 15.31 months. 
TTR, Triplet Arm vs. Doublet Arm 
Kaplan-Meier estimates of median TTR by BICR in the Phase III Response Efficacy Set, calculated for 
patients with confirmed responses, was 1.48 months in the Triplet arm (95% CI: 1.41, 2.00) and 1.54 
months in the Doublet arm (95% CI: 1.41, 1.64) (Table 14.2-5.1.1). For patients in the Triplet arm with 
confirmed CRs, the TTRs were 1.41, 1.58, 16.56 and 1.41 months. In the Doublet arm, patients with 
confirmed CRs had TTRs of 1.31, 1.58, 1.71, 1.48, 1.48 and 4.17 months. 
The time to most responses by BICR in the Phase 3 Response Efficacy Set corresponded with the first 
post-Baseline response assessment at 6 weeks (± 7 days) after randomization.

Comparison of PFS by BICR and Investigator Review, Triplet Arm vs. Doublet Arm 
Investigator and BICR assessments of PFS events (death or progression) in the FAS were reviewed. 
“Type” discordance (i.e., disagreement that patient had an event or did not have an event) was observed 
in 39 patients (17.4%) in the Triplet arm and 28 patients (12.7%) in the Doublet arm. 
“Timing” discordance (i.e., agreed that the patient had an event but disagreed on the timing) was 
observed in 29 patients (12.9%) in the Triplet arm and 32 patients (14.5%) in the Doublet arm. The most 
common type of timing discordance in both treatment arms was that PFS events were identified by BICR 
prior to their identification by Investigator assessment. 
Sensitivity Analyses of PFS, Triplet Arm vs. Doublet Arm 
To assess the robustness of the PFS analysis, the following sensitivity analyses of PFS by BICR were 
performed: 
•  PFS (PPS) 
•  The distribution of PFS in FAS was compared between the treatment arms using 
unstratified analyses. 
•  The analyses for PFS were repeated to assess time evaluation bias, whereby event and 
censoring dates that did not occur within the protocol-specified schedule window were 
moved to either the previous or the next scheduled assessment, as outlined in the SAP. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/271532/2020 
Page 144/224 
 
 
  
  
 
 
• 
“Actual event” analysis for PFS with a censoring rule that included a PFS event even if the 
event was recorded after 2 or more missing tumor assessments. 
• 
“Backdating” analysis for PFS with a censoring rule that backdated events occurring after 
1 or more missing tumor assessments (Appendix 16.1.9, SAP Table 7-1 lines C1 and C2). 
• 
“Further anticancer therapy” analysis for PFS including tumor assessments after initiation 
of subsequent anticancer therapy. 
•  The analyses for PFS were repeated to assess early censoring (i.e., censoring > 2 months 
prior to the data cutoff date) and the impact of any imbalances in censoring distribution. 
Results of these sensitivity analyses for PFS by BICR are consistent with the primary PFS analysis of 
Triplet arm vs. Doublet arm, yielding similar HRs (0.81 to 0.87), median PFS values and p values. 
Sensitivity analyses for PFS by BICR in patients with early censoring also yielded HRs (0.85 to 0.92) and 
p values similar to those in the primary analysis. 
Supportive Analysis: Multivariate Cox Regression of PFS, Triplet Arm vs. Doublet Arm 
The effect of Baseline covariates and potential prognostic factors on PFS by BICR in the FAS was 
investigated using a multivariate Cox regression model stratified by the study stratification factors (ECOG 
PS, prior irinotecan use and cetuximab source). The objective of this analysis was to explore the 
consistency of treatment effect on PFS after adjusting for these Baseline covariates. 
This multivariate Cox regression model demonstrated that, after adjusting for pre-specified Baseline 
covariates, the outcome of the comparison of Triplet arm vs. Doublet arm was consistent with the 
primary PFS analysis, with a 16% reduction in the risk of disease progression or death in the Triplet arm 
(HR 0.84, 95% CI: 0.64, 1.10; 2-sided p value = 0.2106). 
Right-handed tumor sidedness was associated with a 1.35-fold increase in the risk of disease progression 
or death vs. left-handed tumor sidedness. The presence of liver metastases at Baseline was associated 
with a 2.22-fold increase in the risk of disease progression or death. Also, Baseline CRP > ULN was 
associated with a 1.96-fold increase in the risk of disease progression or death. 
Subgroup Analyses of PFS, Triplet Arm vs. Doublet Arm 
Subgroup analyses were performed for each Baseline stratification factor and other relevant Baseline 
variables. Only analyses for which at least 10 events were available in each subgroup are discussed here. 
Twenty-seven of the 34 subgroup analyses with at least 10 events in both subgroups demonstrated PFS 
HRs that favored the Triplet arm. Seven of the 34 subgroup analyses with at least 10 events in each 
subgroup did not demonstrate PFS HRs in favor of the Triplet arm. The greatest difference in favor of the 
Triplet arm was observed in the subgroup of patients with left-sided tumors (HR 0.64, 95% CI: 0.42, 
0.99). 
Subgroups that did not favor the Triplet arm were: ECOG PS at Baseline of 0, no prior irinotecan, non-
Caucasian race, Asian race, normal tumor MSI status, patients with completely resected tumors, and 
patients with liver metastases at Baseline. However, the CIs for all HRs ≥ 1.0 also included lower bounds 
< 1.0. 
Progression After Next Line of Therapy (PFS2) and Time to Second 
Subsequent Therapy (PFS2 and TSST), Triplet Arm vs. Doublet Arm 
Median PFS2 estimates using Kaplan-Meier methodology were 8.38 months (95% CI: 7.75, 10.45) in the 
Triplet arm and 8.08 months (95% CI: 7.06, 9.30) in the Doublet arm (HR 0.81, 95% CI: 0.60, 1.09; 
stratified log-rank test p = 0.0814). Thus, an estimated 19% reduction in risk of disease progression or

death (increase in PFS2) was observed for the Triplet arm compared to the Doublet arm. There were 90 
PFS2 events (40.2% of patients) in the Triplet arm and 94 events (42.7% of patients) in the Doublet arm. 
The TSSTs in the Triplet and Doublet arms were similar, with median TSST estimates using Kaplan-Meier 
methodology of 8.31 months (95% CI: 7.56, 10.35) and 8.41 months (95% CI: (7.62, 9.79), 
respectively. 
Randomized Phase 3: Patient-reported Outcomes 
The EORTC QLQ-C30, FACT-C, EQ-5D-5L and PGIC were used to assess QoL.  
For EORTC QLQ-C30, the global health status/QoL score was identified as the primary PRO variable of 
interest; physical functioning, emotional functioning and social functioning scores were considered as 
secondary.  
For FACT-C, the functional well-being score was the primary PRO variable of interest; the physical well-
being, social/family well-being and emotional well-being scores were considered as secondary. 
The EQ-5D-5L contains 1 item for each of 5 dimensions of health-related QoL (i.e., mobility, self-care, 
usual activities, pain or discomfort and anxiety or depression). Response options for each item varied 
from having no problems to moderate problems or extreme problems. 
Triplet Arm vs. Control 
EORTC QLQ-C30 
Compliance with the EORTC QLQ-C30 assessment was slightly higher in the Triplet arm (88% to 94%)

Supportive study(ies) 
Within this WSP application dossier some “supportive” (for efficacy of Triplet) studies have been 
submitted. Their supportive character is displayed best in terms of the CO as follows: 
“The clinical development programme for encorafenib in combination with binimetinib in metastatic BRAF 
V600E mutant CRC, comprises data from 5 clinical trials. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal trial of this application, randomized phase of BEACON trial, is an overall well designed 
randomized controlled international clinical study. Randomisation was generally appropriate. It is noted 
that neither center nor region was a stratification factor. The number of in- and exclusion criteria each is 
remarkably high. Overall, however, this list of criteria is considered both sensitive and adequate for the 
objective of the trial. 
The randomized part of the trial had two primary objectives of which the first, i.e. the comparison of the 
activity of Triplet vs. Control arm in terms of OS, is the regulatory most relevant. 
Of note is that the comparison of Doublet vs. Control arm, in terms of OS, is a key secondary endpoint 
only whereas the comparison of Triple vs Doublet arm, i.e. the contribution to binimetinib to the overall 
activity (in terms of ORR, PFS, and OS), is only among the other secondary endpoints. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/271532/2020 
Page 161/224 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
OS is a robust and appropriate primary endpoint in a trial in which late or last line therapy is investigated, 
particularly in therapeutic situations where, after treatment failure/progression, no live prolonging 
therapeutic option is available. 
A design issue is, however, that it is a 1:1:1 randomized of different combinations whereas the primary 
analysis (and the sample size estimation) is based on the hypothesis that Triplet (i.e. 
cetuximab/binimetinib/encorafenib) is superior to Control. No hypothesis of the trial is that Triplet is 
superior to Doublet. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The randomized part of BEACON met its primary objective (superiority of Triplet vs. Control in terms of 
OS) in the primary analysis with a data cut-off of 11 February 2019. 
Robustness and sensitivity analyses support the rejection of the null hypothesis. 
Also secondary endpoints in terms of ORR and PFS support the conclusion that triplet, compared to 
control, is an antineoplastic active and in pretreated BRAF+ mCRC patients efficacious combination 
treatment. The same discussion applies with the rejection of the null hypothesis of the randomized part of 
BEACON  as there is no difference in-between cetuximab/chemotherapy (Control) and 
cetuximab/encorafenib (Doublet). 
Endpoints are fitting with the objectives. The primary endpoint OS is per se adequate for the scope of a 
pivotal phase III confirmatory trial in a 2nd/3rd line therapeutic situation without relevant therapeutic 
alternatives which could promise live prolonging effects. Since the primary analysis of the primary 
endpoint (OS) is focusing on the comparison Triplet vs. Control arm it can be stated that the investigation 
of the contribution of binimetinib to the overall effect of the Triplet (i.e. the comparison Doublet vs. 
Triplet arm/therapy) is not the primary goal of the BEACON trial. 
The choice of the co-primary endpoint of ORR has to be considered critically from a regulatory point. The 
main argument for its investigation is that “ORR allows for a more rapid assessment of potential benefit 
and may also be an important measure of clinical benefit. In addition, the assessment of ORR by a BICR 
ensures the consistency and reliability of results.” This is considered problematic since if a (potential) 
benefit is more rapidly assessed, confirmation of this benefit may suffer by a too early stopping of the 
trial (because one of two primary endpoints is reached). 
Finally, the usage of the endpoint DOR is not supported although knowing that this is an endpoint 
meanwhile in widespread use. Informative value of DOR, compared to the information content in PFS, 
becomes nearly negligible if responses are infrequent, and even in a population with a high frequency of 
responders DOR does not measure effects in the reminder population of non-responders. As a secondary 
endpoint, however, it is acceptable. 
An additional analysis with data cut-off 15 August 2019 was available to the applicant and was submitted 
during the procedure. 
The updated results show that the primary analysis was already mature. Medians and hazard ratios are 
essentially the same in both analyses. The latter is more mature with overall 294 (OS) events out of 445 
pts (66.1%). The HR of 0.60 can be translated in a 3.4 months prolonged median overall survival for the 
Triplet vs Control. 
Overall, the sensitivity analyses and in particular the sub-group analyses allow the conclusion that the 
result as to the primary analysis (comparison of Triple vs. control treatment) of the primary endpoint OS 
is robust.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/271532/2020 
Page 162/224 
 
 
  
  
The supportive analyses performed ultimately confirm that baseline prognostic factors are actually 
prognostic factors (independent from treatment arm). 
The issue of patients in the Control arm randomized but not treated seems to have slightly biased the 
result as to the primary endpoint. The median OS for the two patients in the Triplet arm is formally 4.76 
months, thus smaller than the OS of patients randomized to the Control arm (but not treated) and at the 
lowest end of the 95%-CI in this population. In essence, seemingly fitter patients decided not to take 
randomized Control treatment than the reminder accepting treatment with the randomized control. 
In essence it should be noted that the updated data are consistent and confirm the initial results showing  
in particular a considerably higher number of (confirmed) CR and PR in the Triplet arm (compared to 
Control).  
This display of DOR result in a population with overall few responses is interpreted as DOR not adding 
information in comparison to the more traditional endpoint PFS. 
The analysis of PFS is more meaningful than analysis of DOR (and TTR), in particular in a population with 
relatively few responses. The analysis presented for PFS, thus, allows the conclusion that the overall 
population of patients in the triplet arm had a clear clinical benefit compared to the control arm which 
consists more in a delay of progression than in quick and long enduring responses. The updated PFS 
analysis underlines that the primary analysis was already mature. Medians are nearly not affected (4.3 
and 4.5 months vs. 1.51 and 1.5 months respectively). 
The updated analysis of the primary endpoint, comparison Doublet vs. Control, has some effects on the 
median OS in the doublet arm. With the updated analysis, the OS in the doublet arm is essentially the 
same as in the Triplet arm.  
A HR of 0.95 and a ratio of medians of 1.0 allow the conclusion that Doublet and Triplet do not differ from 
an efficacy perspective. Which is also supported by the K-M curve. Thus, binimetinib does not seem to 
contribute to the effect of Triplet (compared to Doublet) on OS. 
ORR was numerically higher for Triplet compared to the Doublet regimen whereas DOR is numerically 
longer for Doublet. PFS is considered as the more relevant endpoint compared to ORR and DOR.  
PFS in the doublet and triplet arm has remained essentially the same. The numerical differences seen in 
the (updated) comparison of Triplet vs. Doublet regarding the endpoints ORR and DOR are not clinically 
relevant. 
Overall, this updated analysis underlines that the primary analysis was robust. Efficacy conclusions made 
on the originally available primary analysis remain virtually unaffected by the update. However, the 
strong trend favouring Triplet compared to Doublet in terms of primary endpoint OS can no longer be 
observed in the updated results. It does not preclude that both Triplet and Doublet can be considered 
efficacious in BRAF+ mCRC patients (each compared to cetuximab plus chemotherapy). However, the 
MAH withdrew the binimetinib part of the application for B/R reasons, thus, applying only for the Doublet 
therapy. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The results from the BEACON/ARRAY study have demonstrated a prolonged survival for both Triplet and 
Doublet regimen compared to the control arm in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer with a BRAF 
V600E mutation, who have received prior systemic therapy.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Following the positive opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP)on 26 July 
2018, the European Commission (EC) approved two marketing authorization applications on 20 September 
2018 for MEKTOVI (binimetinib) and BRAFTOVI (encorafenib) to be used in combination for the treatment 
of adult patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma with a B-Raf Proto-Oncogene, Serine/Threonine 
Kinase  (BRAF)  V600  mutation  (BRAFTOVI  [encorafenib]  MAA  EU/1/18/1314;  MEKTOVI  [binimetinib]  MA 
EU/1/18/1315) based on results from the COLUMBUS Phase 3 Study CMEK162B2301. 
Binimetinib and encorafenib are orally bioavailable kinase inhibitors that target two different kinases in the 
Rat Sarcoma Viral Oncogene Homologue (RAS)/Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase (RAF)/Mitogen-Activated 
Protein Kinase (MEK)/Extracellular Signal-Regulated Kinase (ERK) pathway. 
-  Binimetinib  (also  known  as  MEK162  or  ARRY-438162)  is  a  potent  and  selective  allosteric,  ATP 
uncompetitive small-molecule inhibitor of kinases MEK 1 and MEK 2. 
-  Encorafenib  (also  known  as  LGX818)  is  a  potent  and  selective  adenosine  tri-phosphate  (ATP) 
competitive  small-molecule  inhibitor  of  mutant  BRAF  V600  kinase  that  suppresses  the 
RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK  pathway  in  tumour  cells  expressing  several  mutated  forms  of  BRAF  kinase 
(V600E/D/K). 
Within this work sharing-procedure initially the following extensions of indication were applied for:  
-  Binimetinib is indicated, in combination with encorafenib and cetuximab, for the treatment of adult 
patients with mCRC with a BRAF V600E mutation, who have received prior systemic therapy. 
-  Encorafenib is indicated, in combination with binimetinib and cetuximab, for the treatment of adult 
patients with mCRC with a BRAF V600E mutation, who have received prior systemic therapy. 
Safety analysis 
In the initial application safety data from 5 clinical studies in patients with BRAF-mutant mCRC (N=602) 
were included in the analysis of safety.  
Pivotal Study - ARRAY-818-302 (BEACON):  
Patients  with  BRAF  V600E-mutant  mCRC  treated  with  the  Triplet  regimen  at  recommended  doses  of 
encorafenib 300 mg QD + binimetinib 45 mg BID + the standard weekly cetuximab regimen (N=259) and 
patients with BRAF V600E-mutant mCRC treated with the Doublet regimen at doses of encorafenib 300 mg 
QD + standard cetuximab QW (N=216) vs investigator’s choice (control arm). 
Supportive studies 
-  CLGX818X2103:  Patients  with  BRAF  V600-mutant  mCRC  treated  at  combination  doses  of 
encorafenib 100 mg QD to 450 mg QD + standard cetuximab QW(N=76) 
-  CMEK162X2110:  Patients  with  BRAF  V600-mutant  mCRC  treated  at  combination  doses  of 
encorafenib 200 mg QD to 600 mg QD + binimetinib 45 mg BID (N=17). 
-  CLGX818X2101:  Patients  with  BRAF  V600-mutant  mCRC  treated  with  single-agent  doses  of 
encorafenib 300 mg QD or 450 mg QD (N=18) 
-  ARRAY-162-111: Patients with BRAF-mutant mCRC treated with single-agent doses of binimetinib 
45 mg BID or 60 mg BID (N=16)

Safety data from two separate parts of the pivotal study (ARRAY-818-302) were pooled and four supportive 
studies  were  presented  separately  (CLGX818X2103,  CMEK162X2110,  CLGX818X2101  and  ARRAY-162- 
111) as the doses of encorafenib in these studies were different.  
The “Triplet” population consists of safety data from 259 patients in the Phase 3 randomised Triplet arm of 
Study  ARRAY-818-302  (n=222  patients)  and  the  CSLI  (n=37  patients)  with  BRAF  V600E-mutant  mCRC 
treated with encorafenib 300 mg QD + binimetinib 45 mg BID + cetuximab dosed as per its approved label. 
The pooling of data from patients receiving the Triplet combination in different portions of the ARRAY-818-
302 Study enables the summarization of safety data in the greatest possible number of patients, allowing 
more  robust  subgroup  analyses,  frequency  estimates  for  rarer  events  and  detection  of  less  common 
potential  ADRs  (for  further  information  regarding  the  pivotal  study  please  be  referred  to  the  efficacy

It is acknowledged that the supportive studies in melanoma are conducted in different disease settings 
(different tumour types and stages of disease), hence with different durations of exposure and in the 
context of different tumour related symptoms.

The maximum well-tolerated dose of encorafenib when given as a single agent is 300 mg QD. Encorafenib 
300 mg QD as a single agent is associated with an increased risk of certain adverse reactions compared 
to when used in combination with 45 mg binimetinib. Among pooled population of melanoma patients 
receiving single agent encorafenib 300 mg QD, AEs reported most frequently (≥25% of patients) were 
hyperkeratosis, alopecia, PPES, fatigue, rash, arthralgia, dry skin, nausea, myalgia, headache, vomiting 
and pruritus. 
Encorafenib is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver; patients with mild to severe hepatic

recommended that encorafenib is used with caution, at a reduced dose in patients with mild impairment 
and that patients should be closely monitored (see BRAFTOVI [encorafenib] SmPC, Sections 4.2, 4.4 and 
5.2). Because of missing clinical data in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment, 
encorafenib is not recommended in these two sub-populations. An encorafenib dose adjustment to 300 
mg QD is proposed in subjects with mild hepatic impairment. 
Based on in vitro studies, encorafenib is a substrate of CYP3A4 as well as both an inhibitor and inducer of 
CYP3A4. Clinical results from a dedicated drug-drug interaction study with encorafenib and CYP3A 
inhibitors indicated concomitant administration of encorafenib with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors 
may increase encorafenib plasma concentration. If concomitant use with a strong CYP3A inhibitor is 
necessary, patients should be carefully monitored for safety (see BRAFTOVI [encorafenib] SmPC, Sections 
4.4 and 4.5). Caution should be exercised if a moderate CYP3A inhibitor is co-administered with 
encorafenib (see BRAFTOVI [encorafenib] SmPC, Section 4.5). 
While encorafenib is a relatively potent reversible inhibitor of UGT1A1 in vitro, no differences in 
binimetinib exposure have been observed clinically when binimetinib was co-administered with 
encorafenib. Encorafenib potentially inhibits a number of transporters. Agents that are substrates of renal 
transporters OAT1, OAT3, OCT2 or agents that are substrates of the hepatic transporters OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OCT1 or substrates of BCRP or P-gp may have increased exposure and should be therefore co-
administered with caution. Concomitant medication restrictions were included in clinical trials based on 
potential drug interactions. 
Single-agent Binimetinib 
The maximum well-tolerated dose of binimetinib when given as a single agent is 45 mg BID. Among 
patients with melanoma receiving single-agent binimetinib 45 mg BID across multiple clinical trials, the 
most common AEs (≥20%, all grades) were blood CK increased (45%), diarrhoea (43%), dermatitis 
acneiform (42%), oedema peripheral (41%), rash (34%), nausea (30%) and fatigue (27%). Blood CK 
increased and hypertension was the only Grade 3/4 AEs reported in ≥5% of patients in the Bini P 
population and at a higher incidence (≥2% difference) compared to the Combo 450 RP population (20.8% 
vs 5.5%). 
The exposure of binimetinib is not significantly altered in subjects with mild hepatic impairment but is 
increased 2-fold in subjects with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. Overall, the risk for 
binimetinib to be a cause of or be affected by significant drug-drug interactions is predicted to be low (). 
Cetuximab 
Known safety issues for cetuximab are presented in the cetuximab prescribing information (Erbitux 
[cetuximab] SmPC). The most common adverse reactions (≥ 40% of patients, all grades) reported in 
patients with mCRC receiving cetuximab monotherapy with best supportive care were rash/desquamation 
(95%), fatigue (91%), nausea (64%), pain-other (59%), dry skin (57%), constipation (53%), dyspnoea 
(49%), pruritus (47%), neuropathy-sensory (45%), diarrhoea (42%) and vomiting (40%). 
The main known adverse drug reactions associated with the administration of cetuximab, as per the 
product SmPC include: 
−  Gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting) 
−  Mucositis (including severe mucositis that may lead to epistaxis) 
− 
Increased in liver enzymes (ALAT, ASAT and ALP) 
−  Skin reactions including acne like rash, pruritus, dry skin, desquamation, hypertrichosis, nail 
disorders, Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis

Infusion related reactions 
In the course of the WSP the binimetinib application was - with regard to the updated data (cut-off 15 
August 2019) of the pivotal study (ARRAY-818-302) - withdrawn.  
Thus finally the following extension of indication was applied for: 
-  Encorafenib is indicated, in combination with binimetinib and cetuximab, for the treatment of adult 
patients with mCRC with a BRAF V600E mutation, who have received prior systemic therapy. 
The dossier was updated accordingly. 
In the scope of this variation, initially the development of encorafenib and binimetinib in combination with 
cetuximab  was  assessed.  Therefore,  the  known  safety  profile  of  encorafenib  and  binimetinib  in  the 
melanoma indication, the known safety profile of cetuximab as well as the results from the pivotal study 
ARRAY-818-302 provide the most clinical relevant safety data.  
Due to a quite small number of enrolled subjects in the targeted dose and regimen, the safety information 
from further supportive studies in mCRC is limited and thus, these studies are not described /assessed any 
further within this AR.  
Primarily,  the  safety  profile  of  the  triplet  arm  (encorafenib,  binimetinib  and  cetuximab)  respectively  the 
doublet arm (encorafenib and cetuximab) will be compared with the control arm (Cetuximab and Irinotecan 
or FOLFIRI) (for further discussion regarding this issue please be referred to the sections below, e.g.  overall 
adverse events and ADRs in the target population). 
As requested by the CHMP in a recent scientific advice, additionally the contribution of cetuximab to the 
safety profile of encorafenib monotherapy as well as to the safety profile of the combination therapy 
(Encorafenib/Binimetinib) is discussed within the data from three supportive clinical trials in patients with 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma (CMEK162B2301, CLGX8182101 and  CLGX8182102). However, it 
should be kept in mind that those supportive studies were conducted in different disease settings 
(different tumour types and stages of disease), hence with different durations of exposure and in the 
context of different tumour related symptoms. These aspects limit robust evaluation of the contribution of 
cetuximab (for further discussion regarding this issue please be referred to the sections below e.g. 
contribution of Cetuximab to the safety and tolerability of the doublet and the triplet arm). 
In addition, the contribution of Binimetinib to the safety profile of the combination Encorafenib/Cetuximab 
is  assessed  within  the  results  of  the  comparison  of  the  doublet  and  triplet  arm  of  the  pivotal  study  (for 
further  discussion  regarding  this  issue  please  be  referred  to  the  sections  below,  e.g.  contribution  of 
Binimetinib to the safety and tolerability of  the triplet arm). 
Assessment report

Page 170/224 
 
 
  
  
 
It should be noted, that within the pivotal study, a combined safety lead in (CSLI) Phase was performed to 
justify the triplet combination in the proposed dose. Dose-limiting toxicities were observed in six patients 
(17.6%). As this was acceptable, the randomized was started. Within this assessment, the data of safety 
lead in Phase was not assessed separately as the number of treated patients in the CSLI was small (37 
patients). However, mainly a pooled triplet arm population (CLSI (37 patients) +Triplet arm of randomized 
part (222 patients), Triplet Population (259 patients)) was assessed. 
As stated above, in the course of this variation the binimetinib application was – with regard to the updated 
data  (cut-off  15  August  2019)  of  the  pivotal  study  (ARRAY-818-302)  –  withdrawn  and  the  dossier  was 
updated accordingly.  
The safety assessment was therefore updated as follow:  
- Part 1 consists of the initial assessment  
-Part  2  summarises  the  updated  data  of  the  pivotal  study.  However,  this  part  includes  mainly  but  not 
exclusively the assessment of the safety profile of the doublet combination (respectively of encorafenib) 
only.   
2.5.1.  Part 1 
Patient exposure 
As of the most recent edition of the binimetinib IB (11 March 2019; Edition 16), a total of 2907 healthy 
subjects and patients have received at least 1 dose of binimetinib including 229 healthy subjects, 17 
subjects with hepatic impairment, 6 subjects with renal dysfunction, 164 patients with rheumatoid 
arthritis and 2491 patients with advanced cancer (943 patients who received single-agent binimetinib and 
1548 patients who received binimetinib combination therapy. 
As of the most recent edition of the encorafenib IB (20 June 2019; Edition 11), a total of 1549 healthy 
subjects and patients have received at least 1 dose of encorafenib including 97 healthy subjects, 7 
subjects with hepatic impairment and 1445 patients and advanced cancer (410 patients who received 
single-agent encorafenib and 1046 patients who received encorafenib combination therapy, with 11 
patients who received both single-agent encorafenib and encorafenib + binimetinib combination therapy 
and 4 patients who received encorafenib + binimetinib combination therapy in 2 different studies). 
In patients with metastatic melanoma, the specific combination of binimetinib plus encorafenib has been 
evaluated: 
− 
− 
in 274 patients with metastatic melanoma (BRAF-inhibitors naïve) at the recommended doses of 
450 mg QD encorafenib and 45 mg BID binimetinib (Combo 450 RP) 
in 257 who received encorafenib in combination with binimetinib at doses of 300 mg QD 
encorafenib and 45 mg BID binimetinib (Combo 300) 
In patients with BRAF V600 E mutant CRC, the Triplet combination of 45 mg BID for binimetinib, 300 mg 
QD for encorafenib and cetuximab dosed weekly as per its approved label has been evaluated for safety 
in 259 patients (Triplet°P population).

Study drug modifications 
In Study ARRAY-818-302, the percentage of patients requiring more than one reduction or interruption of 
study drug was higher in the Triplet arm (46.4% binimetinib, 40.1% encorafenib, 23.9% cetuximab) as 
compared with the Doublet arm (20.8% encorafenib, 17.1% cetuximab) and the Control arm (14%, 
cetuximab, 16% irinotecan, 7.5% FA and 36.4% 5-FU). In the Triplet arm, 46.4%, 50.9% and 32.9% of 
patients had at least one dose interruption of encorafenib, binimetinib or cetuximab due to an AE, 
respectively, and 17.6%, 27.0% and 5.9% of patients had at least one dose reduction of encorafenib, 
binimetinib and cetuximab, respectively. Due to the varying dosing schedules of the IV-administered 
agents in the Control arm and the differences in the duration of exposure, it is difficult to make 
comparisons of dose interruptions and/or reductions in the Triplet and Doublet arms to the Control arm;

however, the percentage of patients requiring ≥ 1 reduction or interruption of cetuximab, administered in 
all three treatment arms, was 41.9% for the Triplet arm, 38.4% for the Doublet arm and 26.4% for the 
Control arm. 
In the Doublet arm, 37% and 38.4% of patients had at least one dose interruption of encorafenib and 
cetuximab, respectively, and 10.3% and 4.2% of patients had at least one dose reduction of encorafenib 
and cetuximab, respectively. Cetuximab dose in the Control arm was reduced at least once in 6.2% of 
patients and interrupted in 0.5% of patients.  
Adverse events  
Overall adverse events 
The methods of collecting and analysing AEs in the pivotal study included in the safety analysis are shown 
in Table S7. 
Table S7: Methods of collecting and analysing AEs 
Safety was assessed throughout the study and included collection of all non-serious AEs and SAEs; 
regular laboratory evaluations (haematology, coagulation, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, and pregnancy 
tests); regular physical examinations, dermatologic examinations, ophthalmic examinations and cardiac 
assessments (ECGs, ECHO/MUGA scans); and recording of ECOG PS, vital signs and body weight. 
Table S8 provides an overview of AEs by treatment group for the ARRAY-818-302 Triplet°P Population, 
the CSLI and the randomised Phase 3 treatment arms.

Triplet arm vs Control arm 
In general, EAIRs  (exposure adjusted incidence rate) were lower in the Triplet arm than in the Control 
arm, with the following events having a difference of >10 per 100 patient-months: diarrhoea (32.36 
Triplet vs 47.48 Control), dermatitis acneiform (21.36 vs 31.40), nausea (17.13 vs 35.24), asthenia (6.65 
vs 16.74), stomatitis (3.61 vs 14.10) and neutropenia (0.31 vs 11.64).  
Doublet arm vs Control arm 
In general, EAIRs were lower in the Doublet arm than in the Control arm, with the following events 
having a difference of >10 per 100 patient-months: diarrhoea (10.44 Doublet vs 47.48 Control), 
dermatitis acneiform (9.55 vs 31.40), nausea (10.88 vs 35.24), vomiting (5.82 vs 17.94) asthenia (5.90 
vs 16.74) and stomatitis (1.36 vs 14.10) and neutropenia (0.11 vs 11.64).  
Adverse Events by Time of Onset and/or Duration 
The incidence of AEs over various periods was assessed for the first month of treatment, for months 2 
and 3 and for the first 3, 6 and 12 months of study treatment. 
In the Triplet, Doublet and Control arms of the randomised Phase 3 population, 9.5%, 5.1% and 18.7% 
of patients, respectively received treatment for less than 4 weeks. 
In the first month of treatment, AEs of any grade were reported in 95.9% of patients in the Triplet arm, 
93.1% in the Doublet arm and  95.9% in the Control arm (Grade >3 AEs: 28.4%, 22.2% and 39.4%, 
respectively).  
In the first 3 months of treatment, the prevalence of AEs of any grade was the same for the Triplet and 
Doublet (97.7% in both) and Control (97.4%) arms. However, Grade >3 AEs were more commonly 
reported in the Control arm (48.7%) than in the Triplet or Doublet arms (37.8% vs 33.8%, respectively). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/271532/2020 
Page 177/224 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
Comparing the data reported during the first month vs months 2 and 3 of treatment, the overall incidence 
was reduced in all treatment arms (Triplet: from 95.9%% to 79.3%; Doublet: from 93.1% to 81.0%; 
Control: from 95.9% to 64.8%) whilst the overall incidences of Grade >3 events were similar in the 
Triplet (from 28.4 to 27.9%) and the Doublet arm (from 22.2% to 23.6%) but reduced in the Control arm 
(from 39.4 to 30.1%). 
Reduced incidence rates were also reported for all most commonly reported AEs in the Triplet and Control 
arms, indicating that the majority of events were most frequently occurring in the first month of 
treatment. Specifically, in the Triplet arm, the incidences of diarrhoea and dermatitis acneiform were 
reduced by >20% between Month 1 and Months 2 to 3; nausea, fatigue and vomiting were reduced by 
>10% between the same time periods. Similarly in the Control arm, the incidences of diarrhoea, 
dermatitis acneiform and nausea were reduced by >20% between Month 1 and Months 2 to 3; fatigue 
and vomiting were reduced by >10% between the same time periods. 
Anaemia in the Triplet arm was the only event with a higher incidence in the Months 2 to 3 period than in 
the first month of study treatment. 
In the Doublet arm, the incidence of the most commonly reported events (fatigue, nausea and diarrhoea) 
was reduced by >10% between the first month and months 2 to 3 and no AE was reported in Months 2 to 
3 at an incidence higher than that reported in the first month of study treatment. All AEs reported in >2% 
of subjects during Months 2 and 3 had already been reported in the first month of study treatment. 
In the first 6 months of treatment, prevalence of AEs of any grade was similar for the three arms (97.7%, 
98.1%, and 97.4%). Grade >3 AEs were more commonly reported in the Control arm (51.8%) than in 
the Triplet or Doublet arms (45.5% vs 40.7%, respectively).  
23.0% of patients in the Triplet arm, 23.6% in the Doublet arm and 5.2% in the Control arm received at 
least 6 months (24 weeks) of study treatment. Grade >3 events were similar between treatment arms, 
except anaemia that was reported in 7.7% of the Triplet arm vs 1.9% and 1.0% in the Doublet and 
Control arms. 
During Months 4 to 6 of study treatment, AEs of any grade were observed at a lower incidence than 
during Months 2 to 3 and this decreased in incidences was similar for the Triplet and Doublet arms 
(Triplet: from 79.3% to 55.0%; Doublet: from 81.0% to 47.7%). Grade >3 AEs were reported more 
often in the Triplet arm (23.9%) than in the Doublet arm (15.7%), however both incidences were lower 
than during the Months 2 to 3 time period. 
Prevalence of adverse events of any grade occurring within the first 12 months was similar for the three 
arms (97.7%, 98.11% and 97.4%). Grade >3 AEs were reported at a lower percentage in the Triplet or 
Doublet arms as compared to the Control arm (28.4% and 22.2%, vs 39.4% respectively). 
With exposure in the three arms being low during Month 7 to Month 12 of study treatment, no 
comparisons were made between arms for this time.

Adverse drug reactions in the Target indication 
The lists of ADRs as presented in Table S10 and Table S11 comprise ADRs included in the Company’s 
Core Data Sheet and are considered distinctive of the encorafenib, binimetinib and cetuximab or 
encorafenib and cetuximab combinations in mCRC, as well as ADRs of encorafenib and binimetinib 
retained from the initial MAA. 
Upon review and analysis of adverse events of special interest (AESI), no AESI that did not already 
translate into an ADR in the initial MAA was identified as candidate ADR for the Triplet or the Doublet. 
Adverse drug reaction occurred in the Triplet°P of study Array-818-302 in 97.3% of patients with 48.6% 
Grade ≥3 events. The most frequent ADRs were diarrhoea (63.7%), fatigue (58.3%), acneiform 
dermatitis (57.9%), nausea (47.1%), abdominal pain (39.8%), vomiting (39.8%), anaemia (37.1%), 
rash (31.3%), Dry skin (30.9%) decreased appetite (29.6%) and constipation (26.6%). 
In the Doublet arm, adverse drug reactions occurred in 96.8% of patients with 24.1% Grade ≥3 events. 
The most frequent ADRs were fatigue (51.4%), nausea (34.3%), diarrhoea (33.3%), acneiform 
dermatitis (31.9%), abdominal pain (29.6%), Arthralgia (27.3%), decreased appetite (26.6%) and rash 
(25.9%). 
As mentioned in the methodology for the determination of ADRs, several ADRs identified in the initial MAA 
were not retained as ADRs for the Triplet and/or the Doublet. The reasons for not retaining an ADR were 
either that no event was reported for this ADR or that the incidence for this ADR was low and similar to 
that reported in a population of non-treated mCRC patients or in the general population. 
ADRs not retained for the Triplet and the Doublet were: 
-  Facial paresis - no event 
-  Photosensitivity - low incidence similar to the general population 
-  Hypertension - low incidence similar to the incidence in the mCRC population 
Assessment report

-  Gamma glutamyl transferase increased - low incidence similar to the incidence in the general 
population or in a cancer population 
-  Blood alkaline phosphatase (ALP) increased – low incidence similar to the incidence in the mCRC 
population 
ADRs not retained for the Triplet were: 
- 
Lipase increased – no event 
ADRs not retained for the Doublet were: 
-  Uveitis – no event 
The ADR hypalbuminaemia was not identified in the initial MAA and is considered an ADR of the Triplet 
based on multiple criteria analysis, including the difference in incidence rates of overall AEs.

Contribution of Binimetinib to the safety and tolerability of the triplet 
The contribution of binimetinib was determined by comparing the Triplet arm versus the Doublet arm of 
the randomised Phase 3 part of Study ARRAY-818-302, for the following: 
-  Overall summary of AEs (overall % of AEs, Grade >3 AEs, SAEs, deaths, AEs leading to 
discontinuation, dose modifications or requiring additional treatment) 
-  Most frequent AEs regardless of causality (overall and Grade >3). 
-  SAEs regardless of causality  
-  Comparison of individual adverse drug reactions in the doublet resp. triplet arm 
Overall adverse event profile – Triplet vs Doublet 
A similar percentage of patients in the Triplet arm and the Doublet experienced at least one AE (97.7% vs 
98.1%).  
Incidence rates of Grade ≥ 3 toxicities (57.7% Triplet arm, 50.0% Doublet arm) and SAEs (41.9% Triplet 
arm, 32.9% Doublet arm) were higher (even though the difference was < 10%) in the Triplet arm. 
The incidences of AEs leading to discontinuation of any drug or all study treatment (all grades and Grade 
>3) were similar in the Triplet and the Doublet arms (14.9% vs 11.6% and 9.9% vs 10.2% respectively).  
In the Triplet vs the Doublet, there were more AEs requiring dose reduction of any study drug (30.6% vs 
10.2%) and AEs requiring dose interruption of any study drug (65.8% vs 45.4%). A similar percentage of 
patients experienced an AE requiring additional therapy. 
Overall Adverse events 
Adverse Events with an Absolute Difference in Incidence of >5.0% between the Triplet Arm and the 
Doublet Arm, Regardless of Causality, by Preferred Term – Overall and Maximum Grade >3 are presented 
in Table S12.

Serious AEs 
The most frequently reported SAEs (>2.0% patients) in the Triplet arm were diarrhoea and pulmonary 
embolism (3.6% each), acute kidney injury and nausea (3.2% each), intestinal obstruction (2.7%) and 
ileus (2.3%); in the Doublet arm they were intestinal obstruction (4.6%) and urinary tract infection and 
cancer pain (2.3%). 
For patients with at least one event, the estimated median time to onset of the first SAE was 1.51 months 
(95% CI: 1.15, 2.10) in the Triplet arm and 1.45 months (95% CI: 0.89, 1.81) in the Doublet arm.

Contribution of Cetuximab to the safety and tolerability of the doublet and the triplet 
The contribution of Cetuximab to the safety and tolerability profile of the doublet and the triplet was 
assessed by comparing the Triplet population of the pivotal study with the Combo 300 Population of part 
2 of the COLUMBUS trial (CMEK162B2301) as well as by comparing the doublet population of the pivotal 
trial with the known ENCO 300 mono population (please be referred to the initial MAA):

Safety in special populations  
Subgroups for reporting adverse events 
Adverse events by category are summarised and analysed by subgroups of age, race, gender, tumour 
resection, liver metastases and number of lines of prior therapy. 
Age 
Table S23: Adverse Event Overview by Age subgroup (<65 vs 65 years) 
Race 
Overall, a similar percentage of patients reported an AE in each race subgroup for all treatment arms. 
More in-depth analysis could be compromised by the small patient numbers in some of the subgroups. 
Adverse events with >20% difference in incidence between Asian and Caucasian patients in the Triplet 
arm were nausea (22.2% vs 49.5%) and pyrexia. Based on this data and the limitations inherent to the 
size of the Asian population, no dose adjustment is recommended/required for patients based on race. 
Gender 
Incidence of AEs was similar between subgroups for all treatment arms. The 10 most frequently reported 
PTs were the same for both subgroups (diarrhoea, dermatitis acneiform, nausea, fatigue, vomiting, 
anaemia, abdominal pain, constipation, decreased appetite, asthenia) and only anaemia and decreased 
appetite were reported with >10% difference in incidence between the subgroups (anaemia male: 27.9% 
vs 43.2% female; decreased appetite male 22.1% vs 33.9% female). Incidence of Grade ≥3 AEs and AEs 
leading to dose reduction was higher in females compared to males for the Triplet arm. The incidence of 
SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuations and AEs leading to interruptions were similar between subgroups. 
Tumour resection 
In the Triplet arm no AEs were reported in more patients (>10.0% difference in incidence) with 
completely resected tumours (n=132) compared with those with partially resected or unresected tumours 
(n=90): Anaemia and vomiting were reported in more patients with partially resected or unresected 
Assessment report

tumours compared with those with completely resected tumours (47.8% vs 28.0% and 44.4% vs 34.1%, 
respectively). 
In the Doublet arm diarrhoea was the only AE reported in more patients (>10.0% difference in incidence) 
with completely resected tumours (n=122) compared with those with partially resected or unresected 
tumours (n=94) (39.3% vs 25.5%) and headache the only AE reported in more patients with partially 
resected or unresected tumours compared with those with completely resected tumours (25.5% vs. 
14.8%). 
Liver metastases 
Adverse events occurred in all liver metastasis subgroups in 96.5%-100.0% of patients in all treatment 
arms and populations. 
Dermatitis acneiform, nausea, diarrhoea, abdominal pain and fatigue were in the ten most commonly 
reported AEs in all subgroups. Other commonly reported AEs were: for the subgroup of no liver 
metastases vomiting, anaemia, asthenia, decreased appetite and constipation; for the subgroup of Liver 
Metastases and AST and ALT <3xULN, vomiting, anaemia, decreased appetite, constipation and dry skin 
and for the subgroup of Liver Metastases and AST or ALT >3xULN, abdominal pain upper, headache, 
myalgia, paronychia and pyrexia. 
Number of lines of prior therapy 
In the Triplet arm AEs reported in more patients who had received one prior line of therapy (n=145) 
compared with those who had received two or more prior lines of therapy (n=77) (>10.0% difference in 
incidence) were: nausea (49.7% vs. 36.4%), arthralgia (14.5% vs. 2.6%), pyrexia (24.1% vs. 13.0%) 
and fatigue (36.6% vs. 26.0%). No AEs were reported in more patients who had received two or more 
prior lines of therapy compared with those who had received one prior line of therapy (>10.0% difference 
in incidence). 
In the Doublet arm AEs reported in more patients who had received one prior line of therapy (n=143) 
compared with those who had received two or more prior lines of therapy (n=73) (>10.0% difference in 
incidence) were: abdominal pain (28.7% vs. 11.0%), dermatitis acneiform (32.9% vs. 21.9%) and 
arthralgia (22.4% vs. 12.3%). AEs reported in more patients who had received two or more prior lines of 
therapy compared with those who had received one prior line of therapy were: fatigue (39.7% vs. 
25.2%), anaemia (24.7% vs. 11.9%) and constipation (21.9% vs. 11.9%). 
Renal impairment 
Binimetinib undergoes minimal renal elimination.  In the population PK performed with patients with 
mCRC (Report T2019-00141 and Module 2.7.2 Section 2.7.2.3.3.6), mild, moderate and severe renal 
impairment was assessed as a categorical covariate using creatinine clearance (CLCR) calculated with 
Cockcroft-Gault method for assessment. No increase in AUC is evident in the mild group (CRCL from 60 to 
89 mL/min) and in the moderate (CRCL from 30 to 59 mL/min)/severe (< 30 mL/min) compared to 
subjects with normal renal function (≥ 90 mL/min, moderate and severe renal impairment were grouped 
because of low number of severe patients). These results are consistent with the previous population PK 
evaluations for binimetinib in monotherapy and in combination with encorafenib suggesting a minimal 
impact on exposure in mild and moderate renal impairment subjects that is unlikely to be clinically 
relevant. As specified in the initial MAA and supported by the additional results above, no dose 
adjustment is recommended/required for subjects with renal impairment. 
Encorafenib undergoes minimal renal elimination as well.  In the population PK analysis conducted in 
patients with mCRC (Report T2019-00141), mild (n=111) and moderate (n=30) renal impairment was 
assessed as a categorical covariate using creatinine clearance (CLCR) calculated with Cockcroft-Gault 
method for assessment. Limited increase in encorafenib AUC and Cmax were observed in patients with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/271532/2020 
Page 196/224 
 
 
  
  
mild (CRCL from 60 to 89 mL/min) and moderate (CRCL from 30 to 59 mL/min) renal impairment 
(maximum difference of 11 %) compared to patients with normal renal function (n=251, CRCL ≥ 90 
mL/min). Consistently with the initial MAA, no dose adjustment is recommended/required for subjects 
with mild or moderate renal impairment based on the population PK analysis. A recommended dose has 
not been established for subjects with severe renal impairment. Encorafenib should be used with caution 
in these patients. 
Hepatic impairment 
No additional clinical studies evaluating the impact of hepatic impairment for encorafenib or binimetinib 
has been completed yet in addition to what has previously been reported in the initial MAA. 
Following the request by the CHMP as a post authorisation measure related to the initial encorafenib and 
binimetinib MAAs, the impact of moderate and severe hepatic impairment in patients on encorafenib + 
binimetinib PK is planned to be evaluated in study W00090GE101 “Phase 1 study to evaluate the impact 
of moderate and severe hepatic impairments on the pharmacokinetics and safety of encorafenib in 
combination with binimetinib in adult patients with unresectable or metastatic BRAF V600-mutant 
melanoma“, whose results are due by December 2023. 
In the population PK analysis performed in patients with mCRC (Report T2019-00141), the covariate of 
hepatic impairment (as defined by the National Cancer Institute organ dysfunction working group 
classification) indicated no significant trend versus total encorafenib respectively binimetib CL/F or V/F 
when comparing patients with normal hepatic function with mild hepatic impairmentsubjects. Given the 
limited number of subjects available in the severe and moderate hepatic impairment categories (N=1 in 
each category), no evaluation was performed in this group. 
In the mild hepatic impairment group, there was a higher percentage of patients (≥10% difference) with 
the following categories of events regardless of causality, compared with the normal group: Grade ≥3 
AEs, SAEs (overall and Grade ≥3) and Grade ≥3 AEs requiring additional therapy. However, AEs and SAEs 
(overall and Grade ≥3) considered related to study drugs by the investigator were similar. There was no 
notable difference in the percentage of patients with AEs leading to dose interruption, reduction or 
discontinuation. 
ADRs that were reported in a higher percentage of patients (≥5% difference) in the mild hepatic 
impairment group compared with the normal group overall were: abdominal pain (45.0% vs 36.4%), 
haemorrhage (26.3% vs 20.2%), myopathy/muscular disorders (20.0% vs 15.0%), nausea (51.3% vs 
44.5%), peripheral neuropathy (20.0% vs 13.3%), peripheral oedema (17.5% vs 12.1%), retinal 
pigment epithelial detachment (20.0% vs 12.7%), transaminases increased (16.3% vs 8.7%), visual 
impairment (21.3% vs 15.0%) and vomiting (47.5% vs 36.4%). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Based on comparisons to historical data, no impact on the PK of encorafenib and binimetinib have been 
observed when co-administering with cetuximab. Moreover, encorafenib and binimetinib do not appear to 
impact the PK of cetuximab. Additionally, the lack of PK interaction between binimetinib and encorafenib 
is confirmed.  
As of this application, no new dedicated clinical pharmacology studies have been completed where data 
has been generated regarding drug interactions for encorafenib or binimetinib compared to what was 
previously reported in the initial MAA.

Discontinuation /dose reduction due to adverse events 
Discontinuation 
In Phase 3, the percentage of patients with an AE leading to discontinuation of any study drug of the 
regimen was 14.9% for the Triplet arm (binimetinib 10.8%, encorafenib 9.5% and cetuximab 11.3%), 
11.6% for the Doublet arm (encorafenib 9.7% cetuximab 8.8%) and 17.1% for the Control arm 
(cetuximab 13.5%). 
The most frequently reported AEs leading to discontinuation of any study drug (> 1.0% of patients) in the 
Triplet arm were diarrhoea and nausea (1.8% each); and in the Control arm they were neutropenia and 
small intestinal obstruction (1.6% each). In the Doublet arm, no single AE leading to discontinuation of 
any study drug was reported in > 2 patients. 
Triplet arm vs Control arm 
Incidence rates of overall and Grade >3 AEs requiring discontinuation of all study treatments were lower 
in the Triplet compared to the Control arm (overall: 7.2% vs 11.4%; Grade >3: 5.9% vs 9.3%). The 
most frequently reported AEs leading to discontinuation of all study treatments (≥ 2 patients) by PT in the 
Triplet arm were hepatic failure and sepsis (0.9% each); and in the Control arm were small intestinal 
obstruction (1.6%), and general physical health deterioration and infusion-related reaction (1.0% each). 
Doublet arm vs Control arm 
Incidence rates of overall and Grade >3 AEs requiring discontinuation of all study treatments were lower 
in the Doublet than in the Control arm (overall: 8.3% vs 11.4%; Grade >3 AEs: 7.4% vs 9.3%). The 
most frequently reported AEs leading to discontinuation of all study treatments (≥ 2 patients) by PT in the 
Doublet arm were infusion-related reaction and intestinal obstruction (0.9% each); and in the Control 
arm they were small intestinal obstruction (1.6%), and general physical health deterioration and infusion-
related reaction (1.0% each). 
Dose reduction 
In randomised Phase 3 part of study Array 818-302, the percentage of patients with AEs leading to dose 
reduction of any study drug was 30.6% in the Triplet arm, 10.2% in the Doublet arm and 30.1% in the 
Control arm. The percentage of patients with Grade >3 AEs leading to dose reduction of any study drug 
was 13.5% in the Triplet arm, 3.7% in the Doublet arm and 15.0% in the Control arm. The percentage of 
patients with AEs leading to dose reduction of encorafenib was 17.6% in Triplet arm and 8.8% Doublet 
arm.  
Triplet arm vs Control arm 
Adverse events leading to dose reduction of any study drug in >2% of patients in the Triplet arm were 
diarrhoea (binimetinib 9.9%, encorafenib 4.5%, cetuximab 0%), nausea (binimetinib 2.3%, encorafenib 
2.3%, cetuximab 0%) and fatigue (binimetinib 2.3%, encorafenib 1.8% cetuximab 0%).Adverse events 
leading to dose reduction in >2% of patients in the Control arm were diarrhoea, malaise, fatigue, 
anaemia, neutropenia, neutrophil count decreased and stomatitis. Differences of >2% between the Triplet 
arm and Control arms were observed for neutropenia (Triplet: 0.0%; Control: 7.8%), neutrophil count 
decreased (Triplet: 0.0%; Control: 4.1%) and stomatitis (Triplet: 0.0%; Control: 4.1%). 
Doublet arm vs Control arm 
No AEs leading to dose reduction of any study drug in >2% of patients were observed in the Doublet arm. 
In the Control arm, AEs leading to dose reduction in >2% of patients were diarrhoea, malaise, fatigue, 
Assessment report

neutropenia, neutrophil count decreased and stomatitis. Differences of >2% between the Doublet arm 
and Control arm were observed for diarrhoea (Doublet: 0.5%; Control: 8.8%), neutropenia (Doublet: 
0.0%; Control: 7.8%), neutrophil count decreased (Doublet: 0.5%; Control: 4.1%) and stomatitis 
(Doublet: 0.0%; Control: 4.1%). In the Doublet arm, the most frequent AEs leading to encorafenib dose 
reduction were peripheral neuropathy, musculoskeletal pain and asthenia (1.4% each). 
Dose interruption 
Triplet arm vs Control arm 
In the Triplet arm, 65.8% of patients had AEs of any grade leading to dose interruption of any study drug 
compared with 53.4% in the Control arm. Similar proportions of patients in both treatment arms had 
Grade ≥3 AEs leading to dose interruption of any study drug (37.4% and 35.8% of patients in the Triplet 
arm and Control arm, respectively). The following AEs led to dose interruption of any study drug in >5% 
more patients in the Triplet arm compared to the Control arm: diarrhoea (18.5% vs 9.3%), vomiting 
(8.6% vs 3.1%), nausea (7.2% vs 1.6%) and anaemia (5.4% vs 1.0%). Two AEs led to dose interruption 
in >5% fewer patients in the Triplet arm compared to the Control arm: neutropenia (0.5% vs 7.8%) and 
neutrophil count decreased (0.5% vs 5.7%). The following Grade ≥3 AEs led to dose interruption in >2% 
more patients in the Triplet arm compared to the Control arm: diarrhoea (8.6% vs 5.2%), vomiting 
(2.7% vs 0%), nausea (2.7% vs 0%) and anaemia (4.5% vs 0%). Three Grade ≥3 AEs led to dose 
interruption in >2% fewer patients in the Triplet arm compared to the Control arm: neutropenia (0.5% vs 
5.2%), febrile neutropenia (0% vs 2.1%) and neutrophil count decreased (0% vs 4.1%). 
Doublet arm vs Control arm 
A total of 45.4% in the Doublet arm and 53.4% in the Control arm had AEs of any grade leading to dose 
interruption of any study drug. A slightly lower proportion of patients in the Doublet arm had Grade ≥3 
AEs leading to dose interruption of any study drug compared to the Control arm (30.1% and 35.8%, 
respectively). Three AEs led to dose interruption of any study drug in >5% fewer patients in the Doublet 
arm compared to the Control arm: diarrhoea (2.8% vs 9.3%), neutropenia (0% vs 7.8%) and neutrophil 
count decreased (0.5% vs 5.7%). No AEs led to dose interruption in >5% more patients in the Doublet 
arm compared to the Control arm. No Grade ≥3 AEs led to dose interruption in >2% more patients in the 
Doublet arm compared to the Control arm. Three Grade ≥3 AEs led to dose interruption in >2% fewer 
patients in the Doublet arm compared to the Control arm: diarrhoea (0.5% vs 5.2%), neutropenia (0.0% 
vs 5.2%), febrile neutropenia (0.0% vs 2.1%) and neutrophil count decreased (0.5% vs 4.1%). 
Post marketing experience 
An analysis of the spontaneous adverse reactions was performed to determine if there was any significant 
new safety information. During the reporting intervals (which represents cumulative post-marketing 
data), 616 spontaneous ADRs have been reported to the MAHs. There have been no serious ADRs 
received from Non-interventional post-marketing studies or other solicited sources. 
An analysis of the spontaneous adverse reactions was performed to determine if there was any significant 
new safety information. Cumulatively through 11 February 2019, 949 spontaneous adverse reactions in 
360 unique cases were retrieved. Of the 949 total ADRs, 883 events in 336 cases were in patients on 
combination therapy with BRAFTOVI + MEKTOVI, 36 events in 14 cases were in patients on BRAFTOVI 
single agent  and 30 events in 10 cases were in patients on MEKTOVI single agent. Most patients 
reporting use of single-agent therapy were being treated for the approved indication of metastatic 
melanoma, and otherwise limited information has been received on the rationale for single-agent use. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/271532/2020 
Page 199/224 
 
 
  
  
Among patients on combination therapy with BRAFTOVI + MEKTOVI, there were 166 SAEs in 83 cases. In 
patients on BRAFTOVI single agent, there were 3 SAEs in 2 cases; and in patients on MEKTOVI single 
agent, there were 6 SAEs in 5 cases. The most frequently reported SAE events (≥ 5 events) were PTs of 
death (27 events), disease progression/malignant neoplasm progression (14 events), pyrexia (5 events) 
and acute kidney injury (5 events). Most reports of the PT of death were received from family members 
via specialty pharmacy staff who routinely contact patients to inquire about medication refills. In these 
cases, the circumstances and timing of death are often not reported and few cases were confirmed by a 
healthcare professional. None of the reports with PT of death had concurrent ADRs as the cause of death. 
For kidney-related events, cases were confounded by several clinical factors, including preceding illness 
leading to dehydration, concomitant medications known to cause abnormalities in kidney function such as 
clopidogrel, and patient risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes. 
Use in unapproved indications occurred in 53 patients on combination therapy with BRAFTOVI + 
MEKTOVI, 6 patients on BRAFTOVI single agent and 1 patient on MEKTOVI single agent. Greater than half 
of reports of use in unapproved indications were patients being treated for CRC (N=27). Most events (20 
out of 27) reported with use in CRC were non-serious and consistent with the ADRs reported commonly in 
patients with melanoma. Of the SAEs reported in patients with CRC, 4 reports were of death only as 
described above, 1 hospitalization only (no other event reported), and 2 events of renal failure with 
significant case confounders as described above. 
In summary, all reported events were consistent with the known and labelled safety profile of encorafenib 
in combination with binimetinib. There were no novel events reported in patients being treated for 
unapproved indication. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports/Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Reports 
Since the MAs of encorafenib and binimetinib, two six-monthly Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Reports 
(PBRER) have been submitted to EMA according to the timelines defined in the European GVP Module VII, 
Section A and published in the List of European Union Reference Dates (EURD List). These reports 
summarise safety data reported to the marketing authorisation holders (MAHs) from worldwide sources 
for two 6 month-intervals and cumulatively. 
The first PBRERs covered the reporting interval from 27 June 2018 to 26 December 2018 (BRAFTOVI 
PSUR 1, MEKTOVI PSUR 1) and were submitted to EMA on 6 March 2019. The second and last PBRERs 
were submitted to EMA on 4 September 2019 and are currently undergoing evaluation as per standard 
procedure (BRAFTOVI PSUR 2, MEKTOVI PSUR 2). These reports summarise safety data, covering the 
reporting interval 27-Dec-2018 to 26-Jun-2019, which represents post-marketing safety information, 
clinical trial experience and reports in the literature during the reporting interval, as well as cumulative 
safety information. 
Since first marketing approval (27-Jun-2018 in USA), cumulative post-marketing exposure is estimated to 
be 470,930 patient-days for encorafenib. 
Since first marketing approval (27-Jun-2018 in USA), cumulative post-marketing exposure is estimated to 
be 120,521 patient-days for binimetinib. 
During the reporting intervals of these PBRERs, no significant new safety findings have been identified 
which alter the characterisation of previously recognised important identified risks, important potential 
risks or missing information, as listed in the approved Risk Management Plan version 0.5 
During both reporting intervals, regardless of encorafenib / binimetinib use setting, no actions have been 
taken by the MAHs, regulatory authorities (RAs), Ethics Committees and/or Independent Data Monitoring 
Committees for safety reasons. 
Assessment report

Cumulatively, there have been 137 reports of off-label use, of which 88 for off-label use of encorafenib / 
binimetinib in patients with colorectal cancer. The majority of these reports were generated fromthe US 
and did not contain serious adverse reactions. Of the 5 cases containing SAEs assessed as related by the 
MAH, reported event terms included arthralgia, pyrexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and rash. Analysis of 
these adverse reactions did not show any evidence for a safety issue, which might be associated with 
encorafenib use in the setting of this non-approved therapeutic use at the time of these periodic reports. 
2.5.2.  Part 2 
ARRAY-818-302 Updated results (Data cut-off 15 August 2019)  
Study ARRAY-818-302 is still ongoing and patients are still under treatment or continue to be followed-up 
for survival. An updated analysis of the Phase 3 part of the study was conducted at a data cut-off date of 
15 August 2019 (i.e. approximately 6 months after the primary analysis data cut-off). This later data cut-
off allowed for a follow-up of all randomised patients for at least 6.5 months and provided more mature 
estimates of efficacy and safety data. 
Patient exposure 
As of the data cut-off of 15 August 2019: 
-  The median duration of exposure increased for all arms and remained longer in the Triplet arm 
(21.0 weeks) and the Doublet arm (19.3 weeks) compared to the Control arm (7.0 weeks).  
-  Over 40% of patients in the Triplet and the Doublet arms (40.7% and 43.5% respectively) 
received ≥ 24 weeks of study treatment while only 12.4% of patients in the Control arm received 
≥ 24 weeks of study treatment. More than 20% of patients in the Triplet and the Doublet arms 
(23% and 26.4% respectively) received ≥ 36 weeks of study treatment while only 6.2% of 
patients in the Control arm received ≥ 36 weeks of study treatment. At the time of data cut-off, 
almost 6% of patients in the Triplet and Doublet arms had received one year of study treatment.

Table S24: Updated Duration of Exposure to Study Treatment – Randomised Phase 3 (ARRAY-
818-302 Safety Set) 
As of the data cut-off of 15 August 2019, 67 patients (10.1%) continued to receive treatment in the 
randomised Phase 3 portion of the study compared with 193 (30.6%) at the initial analysis data cut-off. 
The most common reason for discontinuation from study treatment in all arms was PD (61.4%). 
Adverse events  
Overall adverse events 
The overall percentage of patients with AEs was essentially unchanged (within a maximum difference of 
+1.4%) compared with that previously reported for the same population at the initial analysis (11 
February 2019 data cut-off). 
Due to the increase in treatment exposure, the percentage of patients who experienced at least one 
Grade ≥3 AE was increased across all treatment arms, and the percentage who experienced at least one 
SAE or AE leading to dose modification was increased in the Triplet and Doublet arms: 
-  Grade ≥3 AEs regardless of causality were increased in all arms (+8.1% in the Triplet arm, +7.4% 
in the Doublet arm and +3.6% in the Control arm). The percentage of patients experiencing at 
least one Grade ≥3 event remained similar between the Triplet and the Control arms (respectively 
65.8%, 64.2%) and was still lower in the Doublet arm (57.4%). 
-  SAEs regardless of causality were increased in the Triplet and Doublet arms (+7.6% and +6.9% 
respectively). The percentage of patients experiencing at least one SAE remained higher in the 
Triplet arm (49.5%) than the Doublet arm (39.8%). Given the small number of patients 
remaining on treatment in the Control arm (N=7), comparison is not relevant. 
-  AEs regardless of causality leading to a dose interruption were increased by +5.8% in the Triplet 
arm and +4.5% in the Doublet arm but remained lower in the Doublet arm (50.9%) compared 
with the Triplet (70.3%) arm and with the Control arm (55.4%). AEs regardless of causality 
leading to a dose reduction were increased by +1.8% in both the Triplet and Doublet arms but

remained lower in the Doublet arm (12.0%) as compared to the Triplet arm (32.4%) and to the 
Control arm (31.6%).

Relevant Adverse events regardless the relationship  
The overall percentage of patients with AEs was essentially unchanged (within a maximum difference of 
+1.4%) compared to that previously reported for the same population at the initial analysis data cut-off. 
The only relevant differences in incidence (difference in incidence ≥ 5%) were observed for the following: 
- 
- 
in the Triplet arm for the PTs of anaemia (+9.9%), vomiting (+5.8%), and abdominal pain 
(+4.9%). 
in the Doublet arm for the PTs of vomiting (+6.0%), diarrhoea (+5.1%) and abdominal pain 
(+5.1%). 
The most common AEs were the same at the 11 February initial analysis and the 15 August 2019 data 
cut-off. Additional AEs were observed due to the longer exposure to treatment: 
• 
In the Triplet arm, the most common AEs (>30%) remained diarrhoea (66.2%), acneiform 
dermatitis (50.0%), vomiting (44.1%), nausea (48.2%), anaemia (45.9%), fatigue (33.3%) and 
abdominal pain (34.2%). AEs occurring in ≥20% of patients were: decreased appetite (29.7%), 
constipation (26.6%), asthenia (27.9%), pyrexia (22.5%), dry skin (21.6%) and –as of the 15 
August 2019 data cut-off – rash (20.3%). 
•  AEs reported at a higher incidence in the Triplet arm (>10.0% difference) than in the Control arm 
remained diarrhoea (66.2% vs 48.7%), anaemia (45.9% vs 18.7%), dry skin (21.6% vs 8.3%), 
and vision blurred (12.2% vs 0.5%) and – as of the 15 August 2019 data cut-off – vomiting 
(44.1% vs 31.6%), acneiform dermatitis (50.0% vs 39.9%) and pruritis (15.3% vs 5.2%). The 
AEs reported at a lower incidence in the Triplet arm (≥10.0% difference) than in the Control arm 
remained neutropenia (1.4% vs 18.7%) and neutrophil count decreased (0.9% vs 10.9%). 
• 
In the Doublet arm the most common AEs (>30%) remained nausea (38.0%), diarrhoea (38.4%) 
and fatigue (33.3%) and – as of the 15 August 2019 data cut-off – decreased appetite (31.0%) 
and acneiform dermatitis (30.1%). AEs occurring in ≥20% of patients were: abdominal pain 
(27.8%), vomiting (27.3%), asthenia (24.1%) and – as of the 15 August 2019 data cut-off – 
arthralgia (22.7%). 
• 
The AEs reported at a higher incidence in the Doublet arm (≥10.0% difference) than in the Control 
arm remained arthralgia (22.7% vs 1.6%), myalgia (15.3% vs 2.1%), musculoskeletal pain 
(13.4% vs 2.6%), melanocytic naevus (15.7% vs none) and headache (19.9% vs 2.6%), and – 
as of the 15 of August 2019 data cut-off – pain in extremity (11.6% vs 1.0%). The AEs reported 
at a lower incidence in the Doublet arm (>10.0% difference) than in the Control arm remained 
diarrhoea (38.4% vs 48.7%), stomatitis (6.0% vs 23.3%), neutropenia (1.4% vs 18.7%) and 
neutrophil count decreased (0.5% vs 10.9%). The difference in incidence of dermatitis acneiform 
(30.1% vs 39.9%) fell below the threshold of 10% at the 15 August 2019 data cut-off. 
Grade ≥3 events increased across the randomised Phase 3 treatment arms: +8.1% in the Triplet arm, 
+7.4% in the Doublet arm and +3.6% in the Control arm.  
-  Grade ≥3 events occurred in 65.8% (with 45.9 % Grade 3, 7.7% Grade 4 and 4.1% Grade 5), 
with a similar percentage (64.2%) in the Control arm (with 44.0 % Grade 3, 11.4% Grade 4 and 
5.2% Grade 5) and a lower percentage (57.4%) in the Doublet arm (with 40.3 % Grade 3, 6.0% 
Grade 4 and 3.7% Grade 5) 
- 
In the Doublet arm the most common Grade ≥ 3 AEs remained anaemia (5.6%) and fatigue 
(4.2%) and – as of the 15 August 2019 data cut-off – intestinal obstruction (4.6%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/271532/2020 
Page 204/224 
 
 
  
  
- 
In the Triplet arm the most common Grade ≥ 3 AEs in the Triplet arm remained anaemia (23.9%), 
diarrhoea (10.8%) and abdominal pain (6.3%), 
-  The only relevant differences in incidence of Grade ≥3 events (difference in incidence ≥ 2%) were 
observed in the Triplet arm for the PT of anaemia (+7.2%). No other noticeable differences in 
incidences of Grade ≥3 events were observed (maximum difference in incidences ≤1.8% in the 
Triplet arm and ≤0.9% in the Doublet arm). 
In the Phase 3, the time to onset of first Grade ≥3 AE for all patients was longer in the Triplet arm 
compared to the Control arm (3.25 months [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.33, 4.17] vs 1.41 months 
[95% CI 1.08, 2.07], respectively) and this time was 4.73 months [95% CI 3.94, 6.44] in the Doublet 
arm. 
A clinical review of the safety data for each individual patient was conducted on new PTs reported in the 
study between the 11 February 2019 and 15 August 2019 data cut-offs. No new terms of potential clinical 
significance were identified. No new safety concern was identified following clinical review.  
As of the 15 August 2019 data cut-off: 
-  The overall EAIR of AEs decreased in the Doublet arm (-5 per 100 patient-months) whereas it 
increased in the Triplet and Control arms (+22.0 per 100 patient-months and +26 per 100 
patient-months respectively). 
-  No PTs reported with an EAIR below 5 per 100 patient-months in the initial analysis were reported 
with an EAIR ≥5 in the updated analysis, and the EAIRs of AEs shown in Table S25 generally 
decreased in the 3 study arms in the updated analysis compared to the initial analysis, reflecting 
that the longer exposure had no relevant impact on the incidence of AEs when adjusted for the 
duration of exposure to treatment. 
-  Overall, EAIRs remained lower in the Triplet arm than in the Control arm, with the following 
events having a difference of >10 per 100 patient-months: diarrhoea (28.45 Triplet vs 39.76 
Control), dermatitis acneiform (16.95 vs 28.98), nausea (14.01 vs 32.59) and neutropenia (0.24 
vs 10.02). At the 15 August 2019 cut-off, there was no more difference of ≥10 per 100 patient-
months for asthenia and stomatitis between the Triplet and Control arms. 
-  Overall, EAIRs remained lower in the Doublet arm than in the Control arm with the following 
events having a difference of ≥10 per 100 patient-months: diarrhoea (9.69 Doublet vs 39.68 
Control), dermatitis acneiform (7.48 vs 28.98), nausea (9.42 vs 32.59), vomiting (5.78 vs 
16.69), stomatitis (1.11 vs 12.13) and neutropenia (0.24 vs 10.02). At the 15 August 2019, there 
was no more difference of ≥10 per 100 patient-months for asthenia between the Doublet and 
Triplet arms.

Adverse drug reactions in the target indication 
The same method to identify ADRs was applied for the 6-month safety update. This included an 
assessment, both qualitatively and quantitatively of newly reported PTs in the randomised Phase 3 part of 
study ARRAY-818-302 between the two data cut-off dates to identify any potential new safety concerns or 
events requiring further consideration as ADRs. Based on this review, no additional ADR was identified, 
and the list of final ADR groupings remained unchanged. 
The most common ADRs (≥25%) for the Doublet remained fatigue (56.9%), nausea (38.0%), diarrhoea 
(38.4%), acneiform dermatitis (33.3%), abdominal pain (36.6%), arthralgia/musculoskeletal pain 
(31.5%), decreased appetite (31.0%) and rash (30.6%). At the 15 August 2019 cut-off, vomiting 
(27.3%) moved above the 25% threshold. 
The categories of frequency of each ADR remained the same as for the initial analysis. The differences in 
incidences (overall and Grade ≥3) in the Doublet arm are summarised in Table S26. The ADRs with a 
difference in incidence ≥5% were abdominal pain (+7%), vomiting (+6%), diarrhoea and fatigue (+5%). 
There were no relevant changes to the tolerability of the Doublet ADRs with 
°  Nausea and vomiting remaining the two ADRs leading to dose reduction and or interruption in 
more than 4% of patients, with no discontinuation 
°  Renal failure and transaminase increased were the two ADRs that led to discontinuation in ≥ 2 
patients (0.9%)

Serious adverse event and deaths 
Deaths and SAEs 
As of the 15 August 2019 cut-off date, with the longer exposure to study treatment the following was 
observed: 
• 
The percentage of patients with on-treatment deaths increased by 3.1% in the Triplet arm (7 
patients), 2.8% in the Doublet arm (6 patients) and 1.5% in the Control arm (3 patients). Two 
on-treatment deaths in the Doublet arm were due to AEs: colorectal cancer and tumour 
obstruction. In the Triplet arm and the Control arm, none of the newly reported deaths was due 
to an AE.

• 
• 
The number of patients experiencing SAEs increased by 7.6% of patients in the Triplet arm, 6.9% 
in the Doublet arm and 3.1% in the Control arm. The overall incidence of Grade 3-4 SAEs 
increased by 6.3% in the Triplet arm, 6.1% in the Doublet arm and 1.5% in the Control arm 
The most commonly reported SAEs in the Doublet arm remained intestinal obstruction (5.1% vs 
3.6% in Control arm), urinary tract infection and cancer pain (each 2.3% vs 0.5% in the Control 
arm) and – as of the 15 August 2019 data cut-off – abdominal pain (2.3% vs 2.1%). Similarly, 
the most commonly reported Grade ≥3 SAEs in the Doublet arm remained intestinal obstruction 
(4.2% vs 2.6% in Control arm), urinary tract infection (2.3% vs 0.5% in the Control arm), cancer 
pain (1.9% vs 0.5% in the Control arm) and acute kidney injury (1.9% vs 0.5% in the Control 
arm).  
• 
The most commonly reported SAEs in the Triplet arm remained diarrhoea (4.1% vs 5.2% in the 
Control arm), pulmonary embolism (3.6% vs 2.6% in the Control arm), acute kidney injury and 
nausea (each 3.2% vs 0.5% in the Control arm) and – as of the 15 August 2019 data cut-off – 
intestinal obstruction (5.0% vs 3.6%). Grade ≥3 SAEs remained diarrhoea (3.6% vs 3.6% in the 
Control arm), pulmonary embolism (3.2% vs 2.6% in the Control arm), acute kidney injury and 
nausea (each 2.3% vs 0.5% in the Control arm) and intestinal obstruction (4.1% vs 2.6% in the 
Control arm).  
•  As of the update, 9 SAEs were reported under new PTs in the randomised Phase 3 population. 
None of them were assessed as related to study treatment and none were indicative of a new 
safety signal.

Laboratory findings (Haematology and chemistry) 
The frequencies of newly reported or worsening clinical laboratory abnormalities remained similar 
between the two data cut-off dates across all treatment arms. 
At the 15 August 2019 cut-off, the most frequently reported (>30.0%) newly occurring or worsening 
haematology and coagulation abnormalities (all grades) remained (data presented below for the initial 
analysis first versus the update analysis): 
• 
Triplet arm: decreased haemoglobin (55.0% to 69.4% 
•  Doublet arm: decreased haemoglobin (31.9% to 39.4%),

Discontinuation /dose reduction due to adverse events 
The following changes on treatment tolerability were observed as of the 15 August 2019 data cut-off. 
Treatment discontinuations 
-  Despite a longer duration of exposure, there were no relevant changes in the overall incidence of 
AEs leading to all or any study treatment discontinuation in any population of the Safety Set 
(difference <2.5%). 
- 
Incidence rates of overall and Grade≥3 AEs requiring discontinuation of all study treatments 
remained lower in the Doublet and the Triplet arms than in the Control arm. 
o  The most frequently reported AEs leading to discontinuation of all study treatments (≥ 2 
patients) by PT remained: 
 
 
 
in the Doublet arm, infusion-related reaction and intestinal obstruction 
(0.9%each); 
in the Triplet arm, hepatic failure and sepsis (0.9% each) and 
in the Control arm, small intestinal obstruction (1.6%), and general physical 
health deterioration and infusion-related reaction (1.0% each). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/271532/2020 
Page 211/224 
 
 
  
  
-  The percentage of patients with an AE leading to discontinuation of any study drug of the regimen 
was 16.2% for the Triplet arm (binimetinib 14.0%, encorafenib 12.2% and cetuximab 13.1%), 
12.0% for the Doublet arm (encorafenib 9.5% cetuximab 9.7%) and 17.1% for the Control arm 
(cetuximab 13.0%). 
Discontinuation of encorafenib: 
As of the 15 August 2019 Data cut-off, the percentage of patients with AEs leading to discontinuation of 
encorafenib was lower in the Doublet compared to the Triplet arm (respectively 12.2% and 9.5%). The 
most frequently reported AEs leading to discontinuation of encorafenib (≥ 2 patients) in the Triplet arm 
were nausea (3 patients [1.4%]) and asthenia, diarrhoea, hepatic failure and sepsis (2 patients [0.9%] 
each); and in the Doublet arm it was intestinal obstruction (2 patients [0.9%]). In the Triplet arm, many 
of the AEs leading to discontinuation of encorafenib were also reported as leading to discontinuation of 
binimetinib.  
Discontinuation of cetuximab: 
As of the 15 August 2019 Data cut-off, the percentage of patients with AEs leading to discontinuation of 
cetuximab was higher in the Triplet and Control arms (13.1% and 13.0%) than in the Doublet arm 
(9.7%). The most frequently reported AEs leading to discontinuation of cetuximab (≥ 2 patients) in the 
Triplet arm were diarrhoea, hepatic failure, nausea and sepsis (2 patients [0.9%] each); in the Doublet 
arm they were acute kidney injury, infusion-related reaction and intestinal obstruction (2 patients [0.9%] 
each); and in the Control arm they were small intestinal obstruction (3 patients [1.6%]) and diarrhoea, 
general physical health deterioration and infusion related reaction (2 patients [1.0%] each).  
Treatment Dose Reductions 
-  Despite a longer duration of exposure, no noticeable change in the overall incidence of AEs 
leading to any study treatment dose reduction was reported in any population of the Safety Set 
(difference <2.0%). 
- 
Incidence rates of overall and Grade ≥3 AEs requiring dose reduction of any study drug remained 
lower in the Doublet arm (12.0%) than in the Control and Triplet arms (respectively 31.6% and 
32.4%). 
The most frequently reported AEs leading to dose reduction of any study treatments (≥ 1%) by PT in the 
Doublet arm remained fatigue, asthenia, musculoskeletal pain, neuropathy peripheral  (3 patients 1.4% 
each); in the Triplet arm they remained diarrhoea (10.4%), nausea and vomiting (2.7% each), fatigue 
(2.3%), blood CK increased, decreased appetite and dermatitis acneiform (1.8% each), acute kidney 
injury, anaemia, asthenia, ejection fraction decreased, pyrexia and pustular rash (1.4% each). 
Treatment Dose interruptions 
As of the 15 August 2019 data cut-off, slight changes in the overall incidences of AEs leading to any study 
treatment interruption were reported in the Safety Set (difference <5.0%) as compared to the initial 
analysis, due to a longer duration of exposure: 
-  The percentage of patients with an AE leading to interruption of any study drug of the regimen 
remained higher for the Triplet arm (70.3%: binimetinib 14.0%, encorafenib 57.2% and 
cetuximab 50.5%) compared to the Doublet arm (50.9%: encorafenib 39.4% cetuximab 35.2%) 
and the Control arm (55.4%: cetuximab 46.1%).  
-  The most frequently reported AE leading to interruption of any study treatments (≥ 5%) in the 
Doublet arm was vomiting (6.5%). In the Triplet these AEs remained diarrhoea (18.9%), nausea 
(8.6%), vomiting (9.0%), anaemia (7.2%), blood CK increased (6.3%) and – as of 15 August 
2019 data cut-off – asthenia and pyrexia (5.0% each).

Requirement for Additional therapy 
At the 6-month safety update, the overall percentage of patients with AEs requiring additional therapy 
was similar (within a maximum difference of approximately +3.5%) to that previously reported for the 
same populations. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical safety 
This  variation  was  initially  intended  to  support  a  new  indication  for  Encorafenib  and  Binimetinib  in 
combination with Cetuximab.  Thus, for this submission, at first the known safety profile of encorafenib and 
binimetinib  (in  the  melanoma  indication),  the  known  safety  profile  of  cetuximab  (in  the  approved 
indications) as well as the results from the pivotal study ARRAY-818-302 provide the most clinical relevant 
safety data. It should be noted that within the pivotal study, a combined safety lead in (CSLI) Phase was 
performed to justify the triplet combination in the proposed dose. Dose-limiting toxicities were observed in 
six patients (17.6%). As this was acceptable, the randomized was started. Within the safety assessment, 
the data of the CSLI Phase was not assessed separately as the number of treated patients in the CSLI was 
rather  small  (37  patients).  However,  initially  mainly  a  pooled  triplet  arm  population  (CLSI  (37  patients) 
+Triplet arm of randomized part (222 patients), Triplet Population (259 patients)) was assessed (Cut-off 
data: 11 February 2019). 
Within  the  course  of  this  work-sharing  procedure  the  binimetinib  application  was  –  with  regard  to  the 
updated data of the pivotal study - withdrawn. Thus, finally mainly the updated data of the doublet arm in 
comparison to the control arm was assessed (Cut-off data: 15 Aug 2019).  
Compared to the control population of the pivotal study (Cetuximab in combination with Irinotecan or 
FOLFIRI, N=221) the tolerability of both combinations (Triplet, N=261 and Doublet arm, N=220) seems 
to be acceptable. In general, the reported adverse events were manageable.  
The Triplet and the Control had similar overall incidences of AEs, SAEs and AES leading to dose 
discontinuation, modifications or requiring additional therapy, although EAIRs were lower for the Triplet 
compared to the Control. Overall, the Doublet had a safety profile consistently more favorable than the 
Control. 
The median duration of exposure was in the Triplet arm (21.0 weeks) and the Doublet arm (19.3 weeks) 
compared to the Control arm (7.0 weeks).  
With regard to the updated data (Cut-off 15 August 2019) it is acknowledged, that, due to the increase in 
treatment exposure, the percentage of patients who experienced at least one Grade ≥3 AE was increased 
across all treatment arms, and the percentage who experienced at least one SAE or AE leading to dose 
modification was increased in the Triplet and Doublet arms. However, in summary the safety profile did 
not change remarkably. 
It is further noted, that in the course of treatment reduced incidence rates were reported for most of the 
commonly AEs in all treatment arms, indicating that the majority of events were most frequently 
occurring in the first month of treatment. Of note, anaemia in the Triplet arm was the only event with a 
higher incidence in the Months 2 to 3 period than in the first month of study treatment.    
The median time to onset of first Grade ¾ AEs was longer in the triplet and doublet population than in the 
population of the control arm. 
Upon review and analysis of adverse events of special interest (AESI), no AESI that did not already 
translate into an ADR in the initial melanoma MAA was identified as candidate ADR for the Triplet or the 
Doublet combination in the pivotal study. However, it should be kept in mind that - particular for the 
Assessment report

triplet combination - the incidence of several adverse drug reactions was remarkably higher in the pivotal 
study than in the initial MAA. 
Already with regards to the data initially presented, the contribution of binimetinib showed - possibly, 
mainly due to additive toxicities between Binimetinib and Cetuximab - a significant negative impact on 
the safety profile of the triplet combination (compared to the doublet combination): 
Incidence rates of Grade ≥ 3 toxicities (57.7% Triplet arm, 50.0% Doublet arm) and SAEs (41.9% Triplet 
arm, 32.9% Doublet arm) were remarkably higher in the Triplet arm. 
Additionally, in the Triplet vs the Doublet arm, there were more AEs requiring dose reduction of any study 
drug (30.6% vs 10.2%) and AEs requiring dose interruption of any study drug (65.8% vs 45.4%). Skin 
disorders (particularly dermatitis acneiform) are described with a significant higher incidence in the Triplet 
Population than in the doublet arm (57.9% vs 31.9%). More patients required a dose reduction / 
interruption or additional therapy. 
Incidences for gastrointestinal disorders, particularly diarrhoea and vomiting (eventually resulting in 
dehydration) and increased blood creatinine are remarkably higher in the Triplet Population than in the 
doublet arm (63.7%, 39.8% and 12.7% vs 33.3%, 21.3 and 2.3%). Additional acute renal failure adverse 
events (possibly as a consequence of dehydration und increased blood creatinine) were reported at a 
higher incidence (≥ 5% difference) in the Triplet Population than in the Doublet arm, overall (9.5% vs 
1.9%) and for Grade >3 (3.6% vs 1.9%). In addition, it should be noted, that (amongst others) the most 
commonly reported SAEs in the Triplet arm were diarrhoea (3.6%) and acute kidney injury (3.2%). 
Left ventricular dysfunction (LVD) AESIs were reported in the Triplet population (Overall: 5.8%, Grade 
>3: 0.4%). The most frequent PT was ejection fraction decreased (5.0%). 
Eye disorders and venous thromboembolism (VTE) are predominantly described in the Triplet population 
as well (Retinal pigment epithelial detachment 14.7%, visual impairment 17.0%, VTE 6.9%). 
Additional, in the Triplet population anaemia (which incorporated the PTs of anaemia and haemoglobin 
decreased) was a very common ADR (37.1% of patients, with 16.2% Grade ≥3 events and a single 
patient (0.4%) with Grade°4 event; 28.2% events required additional therapy, 6.6% led to dose 
adjustment/study drug interruption and 0.4% led to study drug discontinuation. The incidence of anaemia 
in the doublet arm was remarkably lower (16.2%). 
However, it should be kept in mind, that (similar to the initial MAA of Binimetinib and Encorafenib) within 
the combination including Binimetinib (Triplet population) the incidence of Arthralgia, Headache, 
secondary skin neoplasm and insomnia was decreased compared to the combination without Binimetinib 
(doublet arm). 
The assessment of the contribution of cetuximab on the safety profile of the combination (encorafenib/ 
binimetinib) and of the encorafenib monotherapy is, due to several aspects (e.g. different study settings, 
study populations and durations of exposure), hampered. However, with regards to the data presented, 
the contribution of cetuximab has – possibly mainly due to additive toxicities between binimetinib and 
cetuximab - a significant negative impact on the known safety profile of Combo 300. Thus, a clear 
negative impact is seen regarding the incidences of the following adverse events: diarrhoea, dermatitis 
acneiform, anaemia, abdominal pain, hypokalaemia and pulmonary embolism. However, it should be kept 
in mind, that some of those adverse events might be due to the risks of the underlying disease. 
In contrast to this, the contribution of cetuximab does not seem to have a significant impact on the safety 
profile of encorafenib mono (300 mg). 
With regards to the updated data (Cut-off 15 August 2019) provided by the applicant. The safety profile 
of the Doublet remained consistently more favourable than the Control and differences observed as of 15 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/271532/2020 
Page 214/224 
 
 
  
  
August 2019 were comparable to these observed as of 11 February 2019 both for “raw” frequencies of 
events and for the corresponding EAIRs. 
The most frequent ADRs observed within the doublet combination (encorafenib and cetuximab, cut-off 15 
August 2019) were fatigue (56.9%), nausea (38.0%), diarrhoea (38.4%), acneiform dermatitis (33.3%), 
abdominal pain (36.6%), decreased appetite (31.0%), vomiting (27.3%) Arthralgia (22.7 %) and headache 
(19.9%). 
Based on the submitted data, the combination of encorafenib and cetuximab results in no increased 
frequency of secondary skin neoplasms with the Doublet in mCRC population.  
The percentage of patients with on-treatment deaths was 17.6% in the Doublet arm and 15% in the 
Control arm.  Most of the on-treatment deaths were due to progression of mCRC. The applicant stated 
that the on-treatment deaths that were considered due to events other than disease progression were not 
treatment related which can be acceptable based on the narratives.  
In line with previous data and based on the population PK analyses performed with patients with mCRC, 
renal impairment has low impact on PK of encorafenib. In summary, no dose adjustment is 
recommended/required in mCRC patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. 
Overall, based on all the available (pop) PK and clinical data taken together, no dose adjustment is 
proposed in patients with mild hepatic impairment in the indication mCRC as well. 
The analysis of the subgroups, race, gender, tumour resection, liver metastases and number of lines of 
prior therapy were noted.  
Neither cetuximab itself nor the recommended cetuximab premedication, such as diphenhydramine 
(CYP2D6 inhibitor) or dexamethasone (weak CYP3A4 inducer) have an impact on encorafenib PK. Thus, 
no changes to the SmPC section of DDIs with CYP inducers or inhibitors are required. 
The post-marketing accumulated data for the combination binimetinib / encorafenib remains in 
accordance with the previous cumulative experience from clinical trials and the safety information 
presented in the Company Core Data Sheet and in the SmPC.  
Based on the evaluation of the cumulative safety data presented in the PBRERs and the benefit-risk 
analysis, the MAHs did not propose any safety-related changes to the reference safety information or 
changes to risk minimisation measures at the time of the last PBRER submission. 
Information regarding long-term safety follow-up is missing. This maybe captured as an additional 
pharmacovigilance activity in an upcoming revision of the RMP. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Compared  to  the  control  population  of  the  pivotal  study  (Cetuximab  in  combination  with  Irinotecan  or 
FOLFIRI, N=221) the tolerability of both combinations (Triplet, N=261 and Doublet arm, N=220) seems to 
be slightly better. In general, the reported adverse events were manageable. The safety and tolerability 
profile of the Doublet is more favourable over the Triplet mainly in terms of gastrointestinal toxicities and 
anaemia, with lower rates of dose reduction/interruption of encorafenib and cetuximab. Thus, from a safety 
point of view, the decision to withdraw the binimetinib application is supported.  
Adverse drug reactions observed in patients treated with the doublet combination as well as the monitoring 
and the management of those are adequately presented in the product information.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Globally, CRC is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer worldwide, with about 1.3 million new cases 
and over 550,000 deaths in 2018 according to the GLOBOCAN database (Bray, 2018). It is also the 
second most common type of cancer and the second deadliest cancer in Europe with an estimated 
500,000 new cases diagnosed in 2018 and around 242,000 deaths (Ferlay, 2018). Approximately 25% of 
newly diagnosed patients present with metastases and 50% of patients eventually develop metastatic 
disease (Van Cutsem, 2014). 
Despite major treatment advances over the past decades, metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) remains a 
serious, life-threatening condition, with significant years of potential life lost and substantial losses in 
productivity due to high incidence rates (Bradley, 2011). 
Overall survival (OS) for patients with mCRC has now reached durations of 30 months or longer in the 
most recent generation of randomised clinical trials (Vogel, 2018; Venook, 2014; Loupakis, 2014, 
Heinemann, 2013); however, the 5-year survival for the 22% of patients who are initially diagnosed with 
metastatic disease is 14% (SEER, 2018). The key contributors for longer survival are the increase in 
resection rates of metastases at diagnosis, emerging treatment options in the therapeutic sequence but 
also improvement of first-line therapies. The standard first-line therapy for metastatic disease consists of 
a combination of chemotherapy (based on fluoropyrimidine/leucovorin (5-FU/LV) or capecitabine with 
irinotecan or oxaliplatin, or in combination with both) with targeted agents (monoclonal antibodies 
targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) – bevacizumab – and the epidermal growth factor 
receptor (EGFR) – panitumumab and cetuximab) (Vogel, 2018). 
At diagnosis, 8 -12% of metastatic colorectal cancers harbour BRAF mutations (Troiani, 2016) with a 
broad range of estimates ranging from as low as 5% to as high as 21%.These mutations are usually (> 
95%) at the V600E codon and essentially mutually exclusive with RAS mutations (Barras, 2017; Bylsma, 
2018; Clarke, 2015; Davies, 2002; De Roock, 2010; Sorbye, 2015). BRAF V600 mutations lead to 
constitutive activation of BRAF kinase and sustained RAS/RAF/MEK/ERK pathway signalling, resulting in 
increased cell proliferation and survival (Corcoran, 2012). BRAF V600-mutant CRC is considered a distinct 
subtype of CRC that has unique clinical characteristics and is associated with a worse prognosis, with a 
negative impact on both overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) (Cremolini, 2015; 
Loupakis, 2014; Ursem, 2018). In a cohort of 524 patients, OS for patients with BRAF-mutant colorectal 
cancer was 10.4 months compared with 34.7 months for BRAF wild-type patients. In a multivariate 
Assessment report

analysis, the hazard ratio (HR) for survival was 10.662 (p < 0.001) (Tran, 2011); the situation is similar 
in patients with failure of prior systemic therapy (De Roock, 2010; Peeters, 2014b), emphasizing the 
need to develop novel therapeutic approaches. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Currently, there are no agents specifically indicated for the treatment of patients with BRAF V600E 
mutant mCRC and all therapies used in this setting have never been tested in dedicated phase 3 studies. 
Since BRAF and KRAS mutations are almost always mutually exclusive (De Roock, 2010; Zheng, 2019), 
patients with BRAF V600E-mutant mCRC have typically been treated with standard of-care regimens for 
KRAS wild-type (KRASwt) mCRC in the first line setting i.e. a combination of chemotherapy (based on 
fluoropyrimidine/leucovorin (5-FU/LV) or capecitabine with or without irinotecan, oxaliplatin, or in 
combination with both) with targeted agents (monoclonal antibodies targeting the vascular endothelial 
growth factor (VEGF), mostly bevacizumab or the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), i.e. 
panitumumab and cetuximab) (Vogel, 2018). 
Recommended second-line options depend on the first-line treatment regimen. Common second-line 
regimens include infusional FOLFIRI or irinotecan with or without cetuximab or panitumumab. The 
combination of irinotecan/cetuximab is one of the options recommended by the ESMO and NCCN for 
patients who have previously received irinotecan- or oxaliplatin-based combination regimens, and its use 
in this setting is consistent with current labelling of cetuximab (Van Cutsem, 2016; NCCN V2, 2019). 
FOLFIRI has also been used in the control arm of several recent Phase 3 studies in the second-line setting 
in patients with mCRC unselected for specific mutations (Peeters, 2014b; Tabernero, 2015) 
The EMA approved the single -agents regorafenib and trifluridine + tipiracil as oral salvage therapies in 
patients with chemorefractory disease, who have been previously treated with fluoropyrimidine-, 
oxaliplatin- and irinotecan- based chemotherapy, and antiVEGF- biological therapy and, if patients are 
RAS wild type, an antiEGFR- therapy, irrespective of KRAS or BRAF mutational status. Current ESMO and 
NCCN guidelines include these agents as an additional line of therapy in patients with mCRC who have 
progressed through standard therapies (Van Cutsem, 2016; NCCN V2, 2019). However, they are 
minimally active with OS ranging from 6.4 to 8.8 months, a PFS of 1.9 to 3.2 months and an ORR of 1% 
to 6 % in BRAF wild type mCRC (Grothey, 2013; Mayer, 2015). 
Standard therapy for BRAF wild-type mCRC, even with the more intensive regimens, produces 
substantially poorer outcomes in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant mCRC than in patients with BRAF 
wild-type disease in the first-line setting (Cremolini, 2015; Loupakis, 2014; Ursem, 2018, Venderbosch, 
2014). Second-line treatment for BRAF mutant mCRC using available standards of care for BRAF wild type 
has shown limited benefits with response rates of generally less than 10% (with best response of 
progressive disease (PD) in the majority of patients at their first assessment), median PFS of 
approximately 2 months and a median OS ranging from 4 to 6 months, which is about half of the OS 
observed with BRAF wild-type mCRC (De Roock, 2010; Kopetz, 2017; Loupakis, 2009; Mitani, 2017; 
Morris, 2014; Peeters, 2014a; Saridaki, 2013; Seymour, 2013; Ulivi, 2012). 
The use of single-agent BRAF inhibitors or of a combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitors without the 
addition of an EGFR inhibitor has shown minimal clinical activity in BRAF V600E-mutant mCRC (Hyman, 
2015; Kopetz, 2015), potentially due to feedback reactivation of EGFR (Corcoran, 2012; 
Prahallad,°2012).

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Clinical Study ARRAY-818-302 (BEACON) CRC Study: a multicenter, randomized, open-label, 3-arm phase 
3  study  of  encorafenib  +  cetuximab  plus  or  minus  binimetinib  vs.  irinotecan/cetuximab  or  infusional  5-
fluorouracil (5-fu)/folinic acid (FA)/irinotecan (FOLFIRI)/cetuximab with a safety lead-in of encorafenib + 
binimetinib + cetuximab in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant metastatic colorectal cancer. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the BEACON trial (cut-off date 11 February 2019), the Doublet, and Triplet combination therapy showed 
a 4 months prolonged overall survival, and an about 2.8 months prolonged progression free survival, vs. 
Control.  
An updated analysis (15 August 2019 data cut-off) was provided during the procedure, showing consistent 
results for OS, ORR and PFS compared to the primary analysis. Both the Triplet and Doublet regimens still 
demonstrated substantial clinical benefit compared to the Control arm across all efficacy endpoints including  
•  OS Doublet: median OS 9.30 months (95% CI 8.05; 11.30; [HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.48, 0.77]); Control 
5.88 months (95% CI 5.09; 7.10). 
•  PFS Doublet 4.27 months (95% CI 4.07; 5.45; [HR 0.44; 95% CI 0.35; 0.55]); Control 1.54 months 
(95% CI 1.48; 1.91) 
• 
and ORR Doublet: 19.5% [95% CI 14.5%, 25.4%], Control: 1.8% [95% CI 0.5%, 4.6%] 
and various supportive and subgroup analyses. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
With the updated analysis the MAH decided to leave out binimetinib from the MA claim. This is an option 
which is offered by the design of BEACON trial having prospectively the key secondary objective comparing 
OS Doublet vs Control.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
No  AESI  that  was  not  a  known  ADR  in  the  initial  MAA  was  identified  as  candidate  ADR  for  the  doublet 
(encorafenib and cetuximab) combination in the pivotal study.  
Adverse  drug  reactions  occurred  in  97.7%  of  patients  with  28.7%  Grade  ≥ 3  events  for  the  doublet 
combination  (encorafenib  and  cetuximab)  at  the  cut-off  date  15  August  2019.  The  most  frequent  ADRs 
were fatigue (56.9%), nausea (38.0%), diarrhoea (38.4%), acneiform dermatitis (33.3%), abdominal pain 
(36.6%), Arthralgia (31.5%), decreased appetite (31.0%), vomiting (27.3%) and rash (14.8%). 
The combination of encorafenib and cetuximab did not result in an increased frequency of secondary skin 
neoplasms in mCRC population. 
The percentage of patients with on-treatment deaths was 17.6% in the Doublet arm and 15% in the Control 
arm. The adjusted rate of on-treatment AEs resulting in death  per 100  patient-months  of exposure  was 
0.74 in the Doublet arm and 2.06 in the Control arm.  
The  safety  profile  of  the  doublet  (encorafenib  and  cetuximab)  combination  seems  to  be  acceptable  and 
manageable.

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The survival gain in the BEACON Study shown by the Doublet compared to the Control arm is considered 
meaningful and compelling.  
With a cut-off date 15.08.2019 median OS in the Doublet arm was 3.42 months longer than that in the 
Control arm, with median OS estimates using Kaplan-Meier methodology of 9.30 months (95% CI: 8.05,

11.30) in the Doublet arm and 5.88 months (95% CI: 5.09, 7.10) in the Control arm (p < 0.0001, 
stratified log-rank test). 
Compared to the control population of the pivotal study (Cetuximab in combination with Irinotecan or 
FOLFIRI, N=221) the tolerability of the doublet combination (N=220) is slightly better. The contribution of 
cetuximab does not have a significant impact on the known safety profile of encorafenib mono (300 mg). 
In general, the reported adverse events of the doublet combination were manageable. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
An OS gain of about 3.4 months for encorafenib (plus cetuximab) vs. standard chemotherapy (plus 
cetuximab), observed in the updated efficacy analysis of BEACON trial, is meaningful, compelling, robust, 
mature, and clinically relevant. 
Further primary (ORR) and secondary (PFS, a battery of different QoL questioners) endpoints support this 
assessment within the usual hierarchy of oncological endpoints. 
This clinically relevant benefit is also supported by a slightly better tolerability than the control treatment. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
In accordance with the provisions of Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the MAH had applied 
for an additional one year marketing protection period in the framework of the Braftovi/Mektovi WS 
procedure (EMEA/H/C/WS1695). 
Further to the withdrawal of the request for extension of indication for the product Mektovi (binimetinib), 
an update of the claim for an additional one year marketing protection period has been submitted during 
the procedure excluding binimetinib. 
Having considered the data submitted by the MAH, the CHMP considers that the claim that encorafenib 
(Braftovi) in the claimed indication brings a significant clinical benefit over existing therapies has been 
sufficiently justified.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The benefit-risk-balance is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following

Extension of indication to include encorafenib in combination with cetuximab, for the treatment of adult 
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) with a BRAF V600E mutation, who have received prior 
systemic therapy, as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3 of the SmPC are 
updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. The RMP version 2.0 is acceptable. Furthermore, 
the PI is brought in line with the latest QRD template version 10.1. 
The worksharing procedure leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II 
and Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the worksharing procedure, amendments to Annex(es) I, II and IIIB 
and to the Risk Management Plan are recommended. 
Additional market protection 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the WSA, taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, and considers, that the new therapeutic indication brings 
significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 
"steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

Mometasone is considered an endocrine active substance 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of sections 5.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC in order 
to include a statement regarding the risk to the 
environment based on results from ERA study 
Mometasone furoate – Fish Sexual Development Test 
with Zebrafish (Danio rerio). The Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to introduce minor editorial changes to 
the PI.

B.I.d.1.a.4 - Stability of AS - Change in the re-test 
period/storage period - Extension or introduction of a 
re-test period/storage period supported by real time 
data 
B.I.d.1.b.1 - Stability of AS - Change in the storage 
(EAS) and is therefore potentially harmful to aquatic life at 
a Predicted Environmental Concentration in surface water 
(PECsw) below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. A GLP-
compliant OECD 234 Fish Sexual Development study was 
carried out and as a result section 5.3 was updated to 
indicate that ‘Environmental risk assessment studies have 
shown that mometasone may pose a risk to surface water.’ 
and section 6.6. that “This medicinal product may pose a 
risk to the environment (See section 5.3). Any unused 
medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of 
in accordance with local requirements.’ 
The Package Leaflet (PL) (section 5) is updated accordingly.

Product Characteristics.

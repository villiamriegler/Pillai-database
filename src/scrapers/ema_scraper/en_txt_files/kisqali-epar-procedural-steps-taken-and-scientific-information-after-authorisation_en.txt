In Study A2301 (MONALEESA-2), the OS benefit observed 
based on the final Overall Survival (OS) analysis 
from Study A2301 (MONALEESA-2); a Phase III, 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multicenter study of ribociclib in combination with 
letrozole in postmenopausal women with HR+, 
HER2–, locoregionally recurrent or metastatic breast 
cancer who had not received previous systemic 
therapy for advanced disease, and based on an 
updated pooled safety dataset (including the studies 
MONALEESA-2, MONALEESA-3 and MONALEESA-7). 
The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly.  
The study is listed as a category 3 study in the RMP, 
and the submission of the final Study Report 
addresses MEA 004.  
with ribociclib in combination with letrozole at the cut-off 
for final analysis is statistically significant with HR: 0.765, 
95% CI: 0.628, 0.932; one-sided p-value=0.004). The 
median OS was prolonged with 12.5 months from 51.4 
months (95% CI: 47.2, 59.7) in the placebo group to 63.9 
months (95% CI: 52.4, 71.0) for the ribociclib group 
ribociclib in combination with letrozole. The survival benefit 
increased over time in the ribociclib group compared with 
the placebo group with a 12.2% improvement over the 
placebo group at 6 years (44.2% vs 32.0%).

glands of male rats at a dose of 50 mg/kg/day. Mean 
exposure at steady state (AUC0-24h) in female and male 
rats in whom neoplastic changes were seen was 1.2- and 
1.4-fold that achieved in patients at the recommended dose 
of 600 mg/day, respectively. Mean exposure at steady 
state (AUC0-24h) in female and male rats in whom 
neoplastic changes were seen was 2.2- and 2.5-fold that 
achieved in patients at a dose of 400 mg/day, respectively. 
Additional non-neoplastic proliferative changes consisted of 
increased liver altered foci (basophilic and clear cell) and 
testicular interstitial (Leydig) cell hyperplasia in male rats 
at doses of ≥5 mg/kg/day and 50 mg/kg/day, respectively. 
The effects on the uterus/cervix and on the testicular 
interstitial (Leydig) cells may be related to prolonged 
hypoprolactinemia secondary to CDK4 inhibition of 
lactotrophic cell function in the pituitary gland, altering the 
hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis. 
Potential mechanisms for the thyroid findings in males 
include a rodent-specific microsomal enzyme induction in 
the liver and/or a dysregulation of the hypothalamus-
pituitary-testis-thyroid axis secondary to a persistent on-
target hypoprolactinemia. 
Any potential increase of oestrogen/progesterone ratio in 
humans by this mechanism would be compensated by an 
inhibitory action of concomitant anti-oestrogen therapy on 
oestrogen synthesis as in humans Kisqali is indicated in 
combination with oestrogen-lowering agents. 
Considering important differences between rodents and 
humans with regard to synthesis and role of prolactin, this 
mode of action is not expected to have consequences in 
humans.

moderate renal impairment.  
A starting dose of 200 mg is recommended in patients with 
severe renal impairment. This recommended starting dose 
is estimated to result in approximately 45% lower exposure 
compared with the standard starting dose in patients with 
normal renal function. The efficacy at this starting dose has 
not been studied. Caution should be used in patients with 
severe renal impairment with close monitoring for signs of 
toxicity (see SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2).  
Ribociclib may cause blood creatinine increase as an 
inhibitor of the renal transporters organic cation transporter 
2 (OCT2) and multidrug and toxin extrusion protein 1 
(MATE1), which are involved in the active secretion of 
creatinine from the proximal tubules. In case of blood 
creatinine increase while on treatment, it is recommended 
that further assessment of the renal function be performed 
to exclude renal impairment. Please refer to the SmPC for 
further details.

10.9, 16.3) in the placebo arm (HR:0.587 [95%CI: 0.488,

to patients in the placebo arm (HR: 0.670 [95% CI: 0.542,

A Phase I, open label, multi-centre, parallel cohort, 
single dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics 
of LEE011 in healthy subjects with normal hepatic 
function and subjects with impaired hepatic function; 
C.I.4: Update of sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC in 
order to include a recommendation for a starting 
dose of 400 mg for patients with severe renal 
moderate renal impairment. A starting dose of 400 mg is 
recommended in patients with severe renal impairment. 
Caution should be used in patients with severe renal 
impairment with close monitoring for signs of toxicity. 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild 
hepatic impairment (Child Pugh class A). Patients with 
moderate (Child Pugh class B) and severe hepatic 
impairment (Child Pugh class C) can have increased (less 
than 2 fold) exposure to ribociclib and the starting dose of 
400 mg Kisqali once daily is recommended.

negative locally advanced or metastatic breast 
cancer in combination with fulvestrant for Kisqali; in 
pre- or perimenopausal women, the endocrine 
therapy (aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant) should 
be combined with a luteinizing hormone-releasing 
hormone (LHRH) agonist. The extension to the 
indication is based upon data from study 
CLEE011E2301 (A Phase III randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled study of LEE011 or placebo 
in combination with tamoxifen and goserelin or a 
non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (NSAI) and 
goserelin for the treatment of premenopausal women 
with hormone receptor positive, HER2- negative, 
advanced breast cancer) and study CLEE011F2301 
(A randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
of ribociclib in combination with fulvestrant for the 
treatment of men and postmenopausal women with 
hormone receptor positive, HER2 negative, advanced 
breast cancer who have received no or only one line 
of prior endocrine treatment). 
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 
4.7, 4.8, 4.9, 5.1 and 5.3 of the SmPC have been 
updated and the Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to make some editorial changes in the 
SmPC and to make an administrative update to the 
Estonian and Latvian local representatives addresses 
in the Package Leaflet. An updated RMP version 3.0 
was agreed.

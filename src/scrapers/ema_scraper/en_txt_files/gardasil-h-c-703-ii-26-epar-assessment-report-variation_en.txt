1.  Scientific discussion  
1.1.  Introduction 
Gardasil is a quadrivalent (HPV Types 6, 11, 16 and 18) recombinant HPV (qHPV) vaccine licensed on 
24 September 2006. 
Gardasil  is  indicated  in  the  prevention  of  premalignant  genital  lesions  (cervical,  vulvar  and  vaginal), 
cervical  cancer  and  external  genital  warts  (condyloma  acuminata)  causally  related  to  Human 
Papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16 and 18. 
The current indication is based on the demonstration of efficacy of qHPV vaccine in adult females 16 to 
26  years  of  age  and  on  the  demonstration  of  immunogenicity  of  qHPV  vaccine  in  9-  to  15-year  old 
children and adolescents.  
In November 2008 the MAH submitted a type II variation  to extend the age of indication for women 
up to 45 years old, based on submission of efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of the qHPV vaccine in 
female subjects 24 to 45  years of age from a phase III study (Protocol 019) after a median duration 
follow-up  of  2.2  years.  Following  a  major  objection  the  MAH  accepted  to  limit  the  application  to  an 
update of SmPC sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6. 4.8, and 5.1 to reflect the study results obtained in mid-
adult women (MAW). This type II variation received a positive CHMP opinion 23 July 2009. 
The present type II variation containing the end-of-study data on efficacy, immunogenicity and safety 
from the clinical study conducted in mid-adult women 25-45 year of age (Protocol 019) aims to modify 
sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.6, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC and section 1 of the PL. The median duration of follow-
up for this study was 4.0 years. 
The proposed modification by the MAH of the current indication of the SmPC is as follows: 
Gardasil is a vaccine for the prevention of premalignant genital lesions (cervical, vulvar and vaginal), 
cervical cancer and external genital warts (condyloma acuminata) causally related to Human 
Papillomavirus (HPV) types 6, 11, 16 and 18  (see section 5.1). 
The indication is based on the demonstration of efficacy of Gardasil in adult females 16 to 26 years of 
age and on the demonstration of immunogenicity of Gardasil in 9- to 15-year old children and 
adolescents. Protective efficacy has not been evaluated in males (see section 5.1). 
See  sections  4.4  and  5.1  for  important  information  regarding  vaccine  efficacy  and  immune 
responses  to  vaccination  in  different  age  groups  from  9  years  of  age  onwards  and  study 
populations and by gender. 
The use of Gardasil should be in accordance with official recommendations. 
The final clinical study report (CSR) of Protocol 019 included in the present type II variation fulfils FUM 
014 at the same time. 
The HPV attack rate is high in sexually active adults and women remain at risk for acquisition of new 
infections  throughout  their  sexual  lives.  The  incidence  of  HPV  disease  peaks  within  10  years  after 
sexual  debut.  However,  social  changes  (e.g.  later  marriage,  increasing  divorce  rate)  have  increased

the  risk  in  women  in  their  late  20s,  30s  and  40s. The  literature  review  provided  by  the  MAH  showed 
that  HPV  incidence  rates  in  mid-adult  women  (MAW)  varied  by  country,  in  general  decreased  with 
increasing age, but were still noticeable at older ages. The published data suggest that at least 60% of 
MAW  will  remain  susceptible  to  vaccine  HPV  type  infection  and  can  potentially  benefit  from  the  qHPV 
vaccine. Therefore, the MAH has conducted this efficacy study in MAW. 
1.2  Clinical efficacy 
1.2.1 Protocol 019 
1.2.1.1 
Methods 
The  claim  of efficacy in  mid-adult  women  (MAW)  is  based  on  one  randomized  controlled  efficacy  trial 
Protocol 019 (summarized in table 1) including 3819 healthy sexually active 24- to 45-year old women.  
The study was designed to demonstrate the efficacy in MAW with respect to the composite co-primary 
endpoints of HPV 6/11/16/18- and HPV 16/18-related persistent infection and clinical disease (CIN, AIS 
and EGLs). 
Randomisation was stratified by age in approximately 1:1 ratio into 2 groups, those 24 to 34 years and 
those 35 to 45 years. Within each age stratum subjects were randomized in 1:1 ratio to qHPV vaccine 
or placebo.

Study participants 
The study subjects were healthy 24 to 45-year-old women. The studies did not include pre-screening 
visit for HPV status. Thus, both naïve individuals and individuals who had been exposed to HPV prior to 
enrolment were included. All subjects had at inclusion: 
Pap test 
(cid:131)  Serum anti-HPV testing for vaccine types, HPV 6, 11, 16, 18  
(cid:131) 
(cid:131)  Cervicovaginal sampling for PCR HPV DNA typing 
(cid:131)  Colposcopy if Pap test showed some abnormalities 
To enrich the population with HPV naïve subjects, intact cervix (i.e. those without hysterectomy) was 
used  as  screening  criterion.  Subjects  who  had  surgical  treatment  (such  as  conisation,  LEEP,  laser 
cervical cryotherapy) or subjects who had a cervical biopsy taken within 5 years were not eligible for 
further evaluation. 
Populations 
The following populations were considered for the HPV-specific efficacy analysis: 
Per-protocol efficacy:  
(cid:131)  Received all 3 doses of study vaccine  
(cid:131)  Were seronegative to relevant vaccine HPV type(s) at Day 1  
(cid:131)  Were PCR negative to relevant vaccine HPV type(s) Day 1 to Month 7  
(cid:131)  Did not have general protocol violations  
(cid:131)  Cases counted starting 30 days postdose 3 (Month 7).  
The Per-Protocol Efficacy (PPE) population was used as the primary efficacy population. 
HPV-Naïve to the Relevant-HPV-Type (HNRT) population* 
(cid:131)  Received at least 1 vaccination 
(cid:131)  Were seronegative to relevant vaccine HPV type(s) Day 1 
(cid:131)  Were PCR negative to relevant vaccine HPV type(s) Day 1 
(cid:131)  Cases counted starting after Day 1 
(*This population was similar to the Modified Intention to Treat-2 (MITT-2) population for young adult 
women (YAW) (used in P005, P007, P013, P015) but for MITT-2, cases counted starting after Day 30) 
The HNRT population was used as a supportive population  
Full Analysis Set (FAS)*   
(cid:131)  Received at least 1dose of study vaccine  
(cid:131)  Regardless of PCR status at Day 1 
(cid:131)  Had at least one follow-up visit after Day 1 
(cid:131)  Cases counted starting after Day 1 
(*This FAS population is similar to the MITT-3 population in studies in YAW.  In the MITT-3 population, 
cases were counted started after Day 30) 
The FAS population represents the general (female) population (ITT) in this age group. 
For  the  analyses  that  were  not  HPV-vaccine-type  specific  (population  benefit  analyses)  the  following 
populations were defined: 
Generally HPV-naïve (GHN) population* 
(cid:131)  Received at least 1 vaccination 
(cid:131)  Were seronegative and PCR negative to all 4 vaccine HPV types at Day 1;  
(cid:131)  Were PCR negative to non-vaccine HPV type for which testing were available (HPV 31, 33, 35, 
39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, and 59) at Day 1,  
(cid:131)  Had a negative-for-SIL Pap test result at Day 1;  
(cid:131)  Had at least one follow-up visit following Day 1.   
(cid:131)  Cases were counted starting after Day 1 
(*For  studies  conducted  in  YAW,  the  generally  HPV-naïve  (GHN)  population  was  referred  to  as  the 
RMITT-2  population.  In  the  RMITT-2  population,  cases  were  counted  starting  after  Day  30  instead  of 
after Day 1) 
The GHN population represents the primary analysis population

HPV-naïve to the relevant type (HNRT)  
(cid:131)  Received at least 1 vaccination 
(cid:131)  Were  sero-  and  PCR-negative  at  Day  1  to  the  appropriate  vaccine  HPV  type  (HPV  6,  11,  16, 
18);  were  PCR-negative  at  Day  1  to  the  appropriate  non-vaccine  HPV  type  for  which  PCR 
assays were available (31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, or 59), or had a negative Day 1 Pap 
test result;  
(cid:131)  Cases were counted starting after Day 1. 
The HNRT population is a supportive population 
Full Analysis Set (FAS)   
General population (ITT) as defined above. 
Treatments 
Subjects  were  randomised  1:1  to  receive  either  quadrivalent  HPV  VPL  vaccine  (20/40/40/20mcg  + 
225mcg  amorphous  aluminium  hydroxyphosphate  sulphate  (AAHS)  adjuvant)  or  placebo  (225mcg 
Aluminium adjuvant in normal saline) at Day 1, Month 2 and Month 6.  
Objectives 
The  primary  efficacy  study  objectives  were  to  demonstrate  that  administration  of  the  HPV  vaccine 
would reduce the combined incidence of: 
(cid:131)  HPV6/11/16/18-related  persistent  infection,  genital  warts,  VIN,  VaIN,  vulvar  cancer,  vaginal 
cancer,  CIN,  AIS,  and  cervical  cancer,  compared  with  placebo  in  24-  to  45-year-old  women 
who are naïve to the relevant HPV type at baseline.  
(cid:131)  HPV16/18-related persistent infection, genital warts, VIN, VaIN, vulvar cancer, vaginal cancer, 
CIN,  AIS,  and  cervical  cancer,  compared  with  placebo  in  24-  to  45-year-old  women  who  are 
naïve to the relevant HPV type at baseline. 
The  secondary  efficacy  study  objectives  were  to  demonstrate  that  administration  of  the  HPV  vaccine 
would reduce the combined incidence of: 
(cid:131)  HPV6/11-related  persistent  infection,  genital  warts,  VIN,  VaIN,  vulvar  cancer,  vaginal  cancer, 
CIN,  AIS,  and  cervical  cancer,  compared  with  placebo  in  24-  to  45-year-old  women  who  are 
naïve to the relevant HPV type at baseline.  
(cid:131)  HPV  31/33/35/52/58-related  persistent  infection,  genital  warts,  VIN,  VaIN,  vulvar  cancer, 
vaginal  cancer,  CIN,  AIS,  and  cervical  cancer,  compared  with  placebo  in  24-  to  45-year-old 
women who are naïve to the relevant HPV type at baseline. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
First co-primary endpoint: the combined incidence of HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18-related persistent infection 
CIN (any grade), AIS, or EGLs. 
The definition of the persistent infection endpoint for the first primary endpoint encompassed: 
(cid:131) 
Persistent  vaccine-type  infection  without  confirmed  CIN  –  defined  as  detection  of  HPV  
positivity for  the  same  HPV  type  by  the  HPV  6/11/16/18  PCR  assay  in  2  or  more  consecutive 
cervicovaginal specimens obtained at least 6 months apart (within ± 4-week windows). 
(cid:131)  Vaccine-type  HPV  infection  with  confirmed  CIN  –  defined  as  a  consensus  Pathology  Panel 
diagnosis  of  CIN  1,  CIN  2,  CIN  3,  AIS  or  cervical  cancer  plus  detection  of  the  corresponding 
HPV  vaccine  type  in  specimens  obtained  from  the  same  lesion,  plus  detection  of  HPV  vaccine 
type on the routine visit immediately prior to colposcopy visit in which the biopsy showing CIN, 
AIS or cervical cancer was obtained.

The  number  of  subjects  in  the  PPE  population  who  developed  a  HPV  6-  and  HPV  11-related 
persistent infection, external genital warts, VIN, VaIN, vulvar cancer, vaginal cancer, CIN (any 
grade), AIS, and cervical cancer. 
The  number  of  subjects  in  the  PPE  population  who  developed  a  HPV  31/33/35/52/58-related

grade), AIS, and cervical cancer.  
1.2.1.2 
Results 
A total of 3819 subjects were enrolled in the study. At End-of-Study (EOS), the median follow-up time 
was 4.0 years per study participant (mean follow-up time was 3.8 years). A total of 89.7% and 88.6% 
of study subjects completed their Month 36 and Month 48 visits, respectively 
Thirty-eight  study  centers  located  in  7  countries  in  France,  Germany,  Spain,  Columbia,  Philippines, 
Thailand  and  the  US  conducted  the  study.  The  3  countries  with  the  highest  number  of  recruitment 
were Colombia (43% of study population), Thailand (20%) and the US (14%). Europe enrolled 12.6% 
of the study population. 
Overall,  96.7%  of  all  subjects  completed  the  vaccination  phase  and  90.7%  completed  the  follow-up 
phase.  The  proportions  of  subjects  who  discontinued  during  the  vaccination  period  and  follow-up  and 
the  reasons  for  discontinuation  within  this  period  were  generally  well  balanced  between  the  2 
vaccination groups. Few subjects discontinued due to clinical adverse events. 
Baseline data 
The 2 vaccination groups were well balanced with respect to baseline demographics. 
Sexual  demographics  were  comparable  between  vaccination  groups.  Overall,  99.9%  of  subjects  had 
experienced sexual debut. The median age at first intercourse among non-virgins was 18 years and the 
median number of lifetime sex partners was 2. 
In  both  vaccination  groups  approximately  30%  of  subjects  were  positive  to  a  HPV  vaccine  type  by 
serology  and  approximately  8%  were  positive  by  PCR.  Altogether  67%  of  the  population  was 
seronegative  and  PCR  negative  to  all  vaccine  HPV  types  6,  11,  16  and  18  (64.6%  of  24  to  34  year-
olds; 69% of 35 to 45 year-olds). By age, the proportion of subjects who were PCR positive was lower 
in  the  35  to  45  year-old  stratum  than  in  the  24  to  34  year-olds  (5.6%  vs.  10.2%)  whereas  with 
respect to serology the proportions were similar (28.8% vs. 30.7%). 
The  vaccination  groups  were  comparable  with  respect  to  the  overall  proportions  of  subjects  with 
detectable vaccine HPV type DNA at baseline.

Efficacy against HPV 6/11/16/18-related persistent infection, CIN and EGL 
PPE-population 
Results with respect to the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints in the primary efficacy population 
(PPE) are displayed in Table 2. The results were statistically significant in all three analyses (p<0.001) 
and were generally comparable within each of the two protocol-defined age strata.  
Efficacy against HPV 11-related endpoints could not be confirmed, due to the fact that too few and no 
cases, respectively, were observed.

Of the 96 HPV 6/11/16/18-related endpoint cases, 10 cases occurred in the vaccine group. Of these 3 
were  identified  during  the  2007  endpoint  driven  analysis.  Of  the  7  new  cases  observed  during  the 
additional follow-up, 5 cases had infections of high risk non-vaccine HPV prior to detection of persistent 
HPV  16  infection.  Two  cases  had  HPV  6-related  persistent  infection.  None  of  the  7  cases  observed 
during additional follow-up were cases of HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN or EGL.  
HNRT population 
Results for this population are presented in table 3. Vaccine efficacy was 79.9% (95% CI 69.4, 87.3). 
VE was lower in the older age stratum versus the younger stratum (VE: 71.3% vs. 83.7).

Vaccine  efficacy  against  the  HPV  6/11/16/18-related  endpoint  was  much  lower  in  the  FAS  population 
(VE: 47.2%) (Table 4). Compared to the 2007 end-point driven analysis, VE in the HPV 16/18-related 
endpoint at EOS was statistically significant (VE: 41.6% (95% CI: 24.3, 55.2).

reasonable  estimate  of  vaccine  efficacy  in  a  population  with  unknown  HPV  status  at  the  time  of 
vaccination and constitutes an appropriate complementary analysis of the FAS population. 
Efficacy against HPV vaccine type related persistent infection 
PPE population 
Results of analysis of efficacy against HPV 6/11/16/18-related persistent infection (table 6) are similar 
to the results of analysis of efficacy against the composite HPV 6/11/16/18-related persistent infection 
and  disease  endpoint  because  persistent  infection  comprises  the  majority  of the  composite  persistent 
infection  and  disease  endpoint.  Most  of  the  persistent  infection  endpoints  in  the  qHPV  vaccine  group 
were HPV 16-related. 
Efficacy estimates with regard to HPV 16/18- and 6/11-related persistent infection within each of the 2 
protocol-defined age strata were comparable. No HPV 18- related persistent infections were observed 
in the qHPV vaccine group.

An  exploratory  analysis  of  efficacy  against  HPV16/18-related  PI  was  conducted.  The  estimate  of  VE 
against  HPV  16/18-related  persistent  infection  of  ≥12  months  duration  was  somewhat  lower  to  the 
estimate of VE against persistent infection based on the protocol defined duration of  ≥6 months (±1 
month) (77.2% vs. 86.2%).

VE against persistent HPV 6/11 infection was 95%. The clinical relevance of this finding was questioned 
in the previous 2007 procedure. However, at EOS there are more clear indications that the HPV 6/11 
persistent  infection  results  in  the  development  of  lesions.  The  likelihood  ratios  used  in  the  study  to 
measure  the  value  of  persistent  infection  as  a  predictor  of  subsequent  progression  to  disease  were 
very high (LR+=37.2), which support the use of PI due to HPV 6/11 as a surrogate for condyloma.  
HNRT population 
The efficacy estimates were lower in the HNRT population compared to the PPE population (see table 
7). The findings with respect to persistent infection were similar to the results of analyses of efficacy 
against the composite HPV 6/11/16/18-related endpoint.

FAS population 
Overall  vaccine  efficacy  estimates  were  substantially  lower  in  this  population  compared  with  the  PPE 
population,  as  could  be  explained  by  the  inclusion  of  subjects  with  infections  that  were  present  at 
vaccination onset (table 8). Compared with the 2007 endpoint driven analysis, the estimate of efficacy 
against the HPV 16/18-related endpoint has increased from 23.9% (-1.7, 43.2) to 44.8 % (25.5, 56.3) 
during  the  additional  follow-up  time.  Also  as  regards  HPV  16  and  18-related  persistent  infection 
statistically significant results were observed at end-of study.

Exploratory statistical analysis (N-weighted average efficacy analysis in the FAS) 
When  analysed  separately  for  each  of  the  Day  1  HPV-naïve  and  Day  1  HPV-non-naïve  cohorts  within 
the  FAS,  results  were  different.  In  the  Day  1  HPV-naïve  cohort,  the  estimate  of  VE  against  HPV 
6/11/16/18-related persistent infection was 82.6% (95% CI: 70.2, 90.5).  In the Day 1 HPV-non-naive 
cohort, the estimate of VE against HPV 6/11/16/18- related persistent infection was 23.9% (95% CI:   
-0.5, 42.5). 
The  estimate  of  the  expected  value  of  VE  in  the  FAS  against  the  HPV  6/11/16/18-  related  persistent 
infection endpoint was 71.0% (95% CI: 58.3, 79.9); against the HPV 16/18-related persistent infection 
endpoint  was  69.7%  (95%  CI:  53.7,  80.2)  and  against  the  HPV  6/11-related  persistent  infection 
endpoint is 78.1% (95% CI: 59.4, 88.1). 
Efficacy against persistent infection related to any of 10 non-vaccine HPV types 
The results of analysis of efficacy against persistent infection related to the 10 non-vaccine HPV types 
(31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58 and 59) showed no statistically significant VE in the qHPV vaccine 
group (relative to placebo) in any of the study populations.

The  results  of  the  PPE  analysis  of  efficacy  against HPV  6/11/16/18-related  CIN  showed  VE  of  94.1%, 
with 1 case in the vaccine group versus 17 cases in the placebo group (Table 9). The one case of HPV 
16-related  CIN  2  in  the  vaccine  group  was  already  detected  in  the  2007  endpoint-driven  analysis. 
During  additional  study  follow-up  through  EOS,  no  cases  of  HPV  6/11/16/18-related  CIN  (or  worse) 
was observed in the vaccine group, while additional 8 cases were observed in the placebo group.

Statistical significance was not reached in the CIN 2/3+ endpoint, but clear numerical reductions were 
seen  and  an  estimate  in  the  range  of  that  seen  for  CIN  (any  grade).  The  study  was  not  powered  to 
demonstrate  VE  against  the  CIN  2/3+  endpoint.  The  case  of  HPV  16-related  CIN  2/3  in  the  vaccine 
group was already observed in the previous 2007 analysis.

During  additional  study  follow-up  through  EOS,  no  cases  of  HPV  6/11/16/18-related  CIN  2/3+  was 
observed in the vaccine group, while additional 4 cases were observed in the placebo group. At EOS, 
the  estimate  of  VE  against  HPV  6/11/16/18-  related  CIN  2/3+  is  62.7%  (95%  CI:  –55.5,  93.6).  The 
estimate  of  VE  against  HPV  16/18-related  CIN  2/3+  is  similar  to  the  estimate  of  VE  against  HPV 
6/11/16/18-related CIN 2/3+, as most of the cases of vaccine-HPV type related CIN 2/3+ were related 
to HPV type 16.

Efficacy  against  the  HPV  6/11/16/18-related  CIN  (or  worse)  endpoint  was  demonstrated  at  EOS  with 
an  estimate  of  VE  of  47.5%  (95%  CI:  16.3,  67.7).  (Table  11)    Compared  with  the  2007  endpoint 
driven  analysis,  4  additional  cases  occurred  in  the  vaccine  group  (all  HPV  16-related;  2  CIN1  and  2

The estimate of VE against HPV 16/18-related CIN (or worse) at EOS was 46.9% (95% CI: 5.6, 64.9) 
overall.  By  comparison,  during  the  endpoint-driven  analysis  conducted  in  2007,  the  estimate  of  VE 
without accounting for Day 1 HPV 16/18 infection status was 33.6% (95% CI: –14.3, 62.1). 
Exploratory statistical analysis (N-weighted average efficacy analysis in the FAS) 
In  the  analysis  of  efficacy  against  HPV  6/11/16/18-related  CIN  by  baseline  HPV  status  showed  VE  of 
95.2% (95%CI: 70.4, 99.9) in the Day 1 HPV-naïve and VE of 18.9% (95% CI:-37.7, 52.6 in the Day 
1 HPV-non-naïve cohorts within the FAS. The estimate of the expected value of VE in the FAS against 
the HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN was 87.6% (95%CI: 52.5, 96.7).

The results of analysis of VE against HPV 16/18-related CIN (or worse) separately for each of the Day 
1 HPV-naïve and Day 1 HPV-non-naïve cohorts within the FAS  showed VE of  85.3% (50.3, 97.2) and 
6.9% (-65.5, 48.0) respectively. The estimate of the expected value of VE in the FAS against the HPV 
16/18-related CIN (or worse) is 77.6% (95% CI: 42.2, 91.3). 
Efficacy against CIN (or worse) related to any of 10 non-vaccine HPV types 
No  statistically  significant  efficacy  was  observed  in  the  qHPV  vaccine  group  (relative  to  placebo) 
against the CIN endpoint related to the 10 non-vaccine HPV types (31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58 
and 59) in any of the populations studied. 
In the FAS population 65 cases (vaccine = 40, placebo = 25) of CIN 2/3+ related to non-vaccine HPV 
types  were  observed.  This  imbalance  between  the  two  study  groups  was  observed  in  the  2007 
endpoint-driven  analysis  and  was  due  to  an  imbalance  in  Day  1  prevalent  infections.  There  was  no 
imbalance in acquisition of non-vaccine HPV type CIN 2/3+ in the vaccine and placebo groups during 
the additional follow-up through EOS. 
Efficacy against any CIN (or worse) (regardless of HPV type) 
In the assessment of efficacy against the endpoint Any CIN (or worse) regardless of HPV type, the PPE 
and HNRT analysis populations are undefined because the PPE and HNRT populations are comprised of 
subjects  who  are  naïve  to  the  specific  HPV  type  to  which  a  particular  endpoint  is  related.  The  "HPV-
naïve"  population  that  is  relevant  in  the  assessment  of  efficacy  against  CIN  (or  worse)  regardless  of 
HPV  type  is  the  generally  HPV-naïve  (GHN)  population.  The  GHN  population  is  comprised  of  subjects 
who were Day 1 HPV-naïve to all 14 tested HPV types (i.e., 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 
56, 58, and 59). 
No statistically significant results were obtained in any of the study populations, except for as expected 
CIN related to the 4 vaccine types in both populations. The VE against Any CIN regardless of HPV type 
over  all  age  groups  was  34.5%  (95%  CI:  –12.5,  62.5)  in  the  GHN  population  and  5.5%  in  the  FAS 
population.  The  estimates  of  VE  in  the  CIN  2/3  endpoint  were  lower  and  even  negative  in  the  FAS 
population. 
Efficacy against vaccine HPV type-related EGL 
PPE-population:  There  were  7  cases  (vaccine  =  0,  placebo  =  7)  of  HPV  6/11/16/18-  related  EGL 
observed in the PPE population at EOS. All 7 cases were HPV 6-related condyloma (vulvar n=6, vaginal 
n=2). At EOS, the estimate of VE against HPV 6-related condyloma (100%; 95% CI: 30.7, 100) was 
statistically significant, while not so during the endpoint driven analysis conducted in 2007 (VE 100% 
(95%CI: -49.2, 100). There was no high grade HPV 6/11/16/18-related VIN or VaIN (i.e., grades 2/3) 
nor vulvar or vaginal cancers observed in the PPE population. 
HNRT-population:  There were 13 cases (vaccine = 2, placebo = 11) of HPV 6/11/16/18-related EGL 
observed in the HNRT population at EOS. All 11 placebo group cases were HPV 6-related genital warts 
(1 also with VaIN 1). The 2 cases in the qHPV vaccine group had prevalent infection of high risk HPV 
type at Day 1. The estimate of VE against HPV 6/11/16/18-related EGL (81.9%; 95% CI: 17.2, 98.1) 
was statistically significant. There was no high-grade HPV 6/11/16/18-related VIN or VaIN (i.e., grades 
2/3) nor vulvar or vaginal cancers observed in the HNRT population. 
FAS  population:  There  were  a  total  of  23  cases  (vaccine  =  11,  placebo  =  12)  of  HPV  6/11/16/18-
related  EGL  observed  at  EOS.  Of  these,  9  cases  (vaccine  =  8,  placebo  =  1)  were  due  to  Day  1 
CHMP variation assessment report

prevalent infections and 13 (vaccine = 2, placebo = 11) were due to incident infections and 1 case of 
HPV 6-related genital warts in the vaccine group with unknown HPV 6 PCR status at Day 1. In the FAS 
(pooled population), the estimate of efficacy of the qHPV vaccine against HPV 6/11/16/18-related EGL 
is 8.5% (95% CI: –126.6, 63.4).  
The estimate of the expected value of VE in the FAS (that accounts for HPV infection status at Day 1) 
against the HPV 6/11/16/18-related EGL is 61.1% (95% CI: –67.0, 90.9). 
Other efficacy Analyses - Evaluation of population benefit of the vaccine  
No  significant  efficacy  results  were  obtained  in  the  population  benefit  endpoints.  No  efficacy  against 
the  overall  burden  of  cervical  or  external  genital  HPV  disease  could  be  demonstrated.  The  qHPV 
vaccine was efficacious in preventing HPV 16/18-related Pap abnormalities of ASC-US positive for high-
risk HPV probe or worse in all study populations, but no significant efficacy could be shown against Pap 
abnormalities  due  to  any  HPV  type  or  in  the  reduction  in  the  incidence  of  cervical  or  external  genital 
procedures. The number of endpoints was insufficient to detect a statistically significant effect. 
Therapeutic efficacy  
Clearance of prevalent infection related to vaccine HPV types  
The impact of a 3-dose vaccination regimen on the clearance of vaccine HPV type DNA among subjects 
who were PCR-positive at Day 1 to the relevant HPV type was analysed. 
The  current  analysis  at  EOS  again  shows  a  higher  clearance  of  HPV  16  DNA  in  the  placebo  group 
versus the vaccine group (percent incidence reduction 54.8 % (95% CI: 018.6, 75.5)) among subjects 
who were Day 1 PCR positive and seronegative (table 12).

There were no cases of HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN (any grade) or EGL observed among subjects who 
were seropositive and PCR-negative to the relevant HPV type at Day 1 during the course of the study. 
In a post hoc analyses of individuals (who received at least one vaccination) with evidence of a prior 
infection  with  a  vaccine  HPV  type  (seropositive)  no  longer  detectable  (PCR  negative)  at  vaccination 
onset  the  efficacy  of  Gardasil  to  prevent  conditions  due  to  the  recurrence  of  the  same  HPV  type  was 
100% (95% CI: 62.8, 100.0; 0 vs. 12 cases [n = 2572 from pooled studies in young women]) against 
HPV  6-,  11-,  16-,  and  18-related  CIN  2/3,  VIN  2/3,  VaIN  2/3,  and  genital  warts  in  women  16  to  26 
years.  Efficacy  was  68.2%  (95%  CI:  17.9,  89.5;  6  vs.  20  cases  [n=  832  from  studies  in  young  and 
adult women combined]) against HPV 16- and 18-related persistent infection in women 16 to 45 years. 
1.2.1.3 
Discussion 
The main goal of the study was to provide data to support that efficacy in MAW was comparable to that 
shown in young adult women (YAW). The study was designed to demonstrate the efficacy in MAW with 
respect to the composite  co-primary endpoints of HPV 6/11/16/18- and HPV 16/18-related  persistent 
infection and clinical disease (CIN, AIS and EGLs). The scientific basis for these endpoints constituted 
the natural history of HPV and the results of the clinical program in YAW. The original licensure of the 
CHMP variation assessment report

qHPV vaccine was based on histologically-confirmed efficacy endpoints, i.e. HPV 16/18-related CIN 2/3 
and AIS, as surrogates for cervical cancer. Subsequent to the demonstration of robust efficacy in this 
endpoint  in  YAW,  a  virological  endpoint  was  applied  in  the  study  of  MAW.  Persistent  HPV  infection  is 
recognised  as  a  necessary  pre-requisite  for  the  development  of  cervical  cancer.  Comparable  efficacy 
against HPV 16/18-related persistent infection and CIN 2/3 was demonstrated in the YAW studies. The 
CHMP´s  ad-hoc  expert  HPV  meeting  on  December  3rd  2009  recommended  the  use  of  persistent 
infection due to oncogenic HPV types of 6 months duration as a surrogate endpoint for cervical cancer 
in  efficacy  trials  of  HPV  vaccines.  The  MAH  conducted  an  exploratory  analysis  of  efficacy  against 
HPV16/18 persistent infection based on duration of >12 months and results showed a similar VE to the 
protocol defined definition of 6 months. In this study (P019), the likelihood ratios of persistent infection 
as  a  predictor  of  type-specific  mediated  disease  due  to  HPV  6/11/16/18,  HPV  16/18  and  HPV  6/11 
were high in MAW. Based on all these findings the use of 6 months persistent infection is considered 
justified including for HPV 6/11. 
Regarding baseline HPV status, it was demonstrated that 67% of the mid-adult women (64.6% of the 
24- to 34-year-olds and 69% of the 35- to 45-year-olds) were seronegative and PCR negative to HPV 
6,  11,  16  and  18  at  Day  1  and  thus,  susceptible  to  all  4  vaccine  HPV  types  at  study  entry.    The 
corresponding  percentage  in  YAW  was  73%.  However,  as  a  reflection  of  the  higher  cumulative 
exposure  of  HPV  and  the  lower  number  of  new  sexual  partners  in  older  women,  the  MAW  had  lower 
baseline  HPV  DNA  prevalence  and  higher  seroprevalence  than  YAW.  Within  the  MAW,  HPV  DNA 
prevalence  was  lowest  in  the  35-  to  45-year-olds  (5.2%)  compared  with  the  24-  to  34-year-olds 
(10.2%)  whereas  the  seroprevalence  was  comparable  (~30%).  Overall,  the  HPV  sero-/DNA- 
prevalence data observed in P019 are consistent with literature estimates. However, in the integrated 
summary  report  of  natural  history  in  P019,  it  was  shown  that  HPV  sero-/DNA-  prevalence  varied 
greatly by countries/continents, which has to be considered in the evaluation of efficacy results.  
Efficacy: 
PPE  population:  The  findings  at  end  of  study  confirm  the  efficacy  of  the  qHPV  vaccine  in  MAW  in  the 
PPE  population  demonstrated  in  the  2007  endpoint  driven  analysis.  The  qHPV  vaccine  was  highly 
efficacious in the PPE  population with respect to the relevant endpoints, persistent infection, CIN and 
EGL. Efficacy was observed overall and in each age stratum. High efficacy was observed with respect 
to HPV 6, 16 and 18 individually; with respect to persistent infection alone and with respect to disease 
endpoints  (CIN,  AIS,  or  EGL)  alone.  There  were  no  cases  of  HPV  11  infection  or  disease  observed  in 
the PPE population due to the rarity of this HPV type. VE was 88.7% against HPV 6/11/16/18-related 
persistent  infection  (PI)/disease,  84.7%  against  HPV  16/18-related  PI/disease,  94.7%  against 
HPV6/11-related  PI/disease  and  94.1%  against  vaccine  type  related  CIN,  which  is  generally 
comparable  to  VE  obtained  in  the  YAW  studies.  No  statistical  significance  was  reached  in  the  HPV 
16/18-related CIN 2/3 endpoint (VE 83.4%; 95%CI: -36.7, 99.6). There were 7 new endpoint cases (5 
HPV16 PI and 2 HPV6 PI) in the vaccine group and 46 new cases in the placebo group detected during 
the  additional  follow-up  since  the  2007  analysis.  All  of  these  7  cases  of  persistent  infection  had 
preceding  infections  with  multiple  non-vaccine  HPV  types.  There  were  no  new  cases  of  HPV 
6/11/16/18-related  CIN  or  EGL  reported  in  the  qHPV  group  since  the  first  analysis.  In  contrast  there 
were 8 new cases of HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN (any grade), 2 new cases of HPV 6/11/16/18-related 
CIN 2/3 or worse and 3 new cases of EGL in the placebo group during the same period. 
HNRT  population:  During  the  assessment  of  the  2007  endpoint-driven  report  concerns  were  raised 
since the number of CIN 2/3 cases in the vaccine group was the same as in the placebo group (3 vs. 4 
cases). It was clarified that all cases in the vaccine group had non-vaccine HPV types at baseline and 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 19/33 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
had  very  early  detection  of  HPV  16-related  disease  suggesting  the  presence  of  prevalent  HPV  16 
infection at baseline. At EOS no new cases of HPV 16/18-related CIN 2/3 were observed in the vaccine 
group,  while  additional  4  cases  were  observed  in  the  placebo  group.  The  estimate  of  VE  against  HPV 
16/18-related CIN 2/3+ was 63% (95% CI -54.6, 93.7). No HPV 18-related CIN lesion was detected. 
For  all  endpoints,  efficacy  was  somewhat  lower  in  the  HNRT  population.  The  lower  efficacy  was  a 
function  of  the  presence  of  infections  with  onset  detected  at  the  Month  7  visit  (such  infections  were 
acquired  between  Day  1  and  Month  7  and  not  a  result  of  waning  immunity.  The  observed  efficacy  in 
P019  followed  the  same  pattern  for  similar  endpoints  seen  in  YAW  for  a  similar  duration  of  follow-up 
and that efficacy continues to increase over time. 
FAS  (ITT)  population:  Improved  efficacy  results  were  demonstrated  during  the  additional  follow-up 
since  the  2007  analysis  with  VE  against  HPV  6/11/16/18-related  PI/disease  of  47.2%  (33.5,  58.2).  
Four new cases of HPV 6/11/16/18-related CIN were detected in the vaccine group of FAS during the 
additional follow-up  through  EOS.  It  is  noted  that  at  least  three  of  these  cases  also  were  infected  by 
non-vaccine serotypes. VE in the more important HPV 16/18-related PI/disease endpoint now reached 
statistical significance (VE: 41.6% (24.3, 55.2). These point estimates are lower than those observed 
among  YAW.  With  respect  to  HPV  16/18  CIN2/3  only  an  efficacy  trend  was  observed  (VE:  22.4%  (-
42.5, 58.3), but the estimate was improved relative to the 2007 analysis (VE: 9.9%). There were no 
new cases of HPV 16/18-related CIN 2/3+ in the vaccine group since the 2007 analysis. There were a 
total  of  48  (qHPV=21,  placebo  =27)  cases  of  vaccine  type  related  CIN  2/3  in  the  FAS population.  An 
exploratory statistical analysis N-weighted analysis was conducted whereby the expected value of VE in 
the  FAS  was  computed  to  account  for  the  anticipated  VE-by-  Day  1  HPV  status  interaction.  This 
analysis gave higher efficacy estimates than the pooled analysis and provides a reasonable estimate of 
vaccine efficacy in a population with unknown HPV status at the time of vaccination and constitutes an 
appropriate complementary analysis of the FAS population. 
Other efficacy populations:  
Day  1  PCR  positive  and  seronegative:  The  observation  of  a  significantly  higher  clearance  of  HPV  16 
DNA in the placebo group versus the vaccine group in the first 2007 analysis remained and was even 
stronger  at  end  of  study  (percent  incidence  reduction    54.8%   (95%  CI:  18.6,  75.5)  among  subjects 
who were Day 1 PCR positive and seronegative to HPV 16. A two-fold higher prevalence of co-infection 
in  the  vaccine  group  compared  to  the  placebo  group probably  explains  the longer  persistence  of  HPV 
16.  A  time-to-clearance  analysis  of  HPV  infection  showed  that  in  the  cohort  with  co-infection  at  any 
time  from  Day  1  to  EOS  some  subjects  in  the  vaccine  group  compared  to  placebo  exhibited  delay  in 
clearance  of  prevalent  HPV  16  infection  whereas  in  the  cohort  of  subjects  without  co-infection  there 
was  no  difference  between  vaccine  and  placebo  groups  with  respect  to  HPV  16  clearance.  The 
imbalance  in  co-infections  likely  explains  the  unexpected  reverse  therapeutic  efficacy  observed.  
Moreover,  it  is  difficult  to  understand  by  which  mechanism  the  qHPV  vaccine  would  exert  a  negative 
effect on on-going HPV infections.  
Day  1  seropositive  and  PCR  negative:  Analysis  of  efficacy  against  the  recurrence  of  persistent  HPV 
6/11/16/18 infection among subjects who were seropositive and PCR negative to the relevant HPV type 
at baseline showed statistically significant results. The estimate of VE at EOS against HPV 6/11/16/18-
related persistent infection that is of ≥6 months duration over consecutive visits 6 (±1) months apart 
was 66.8% (95% CI: 3.8, 90.5). Among the 35 to 45 year-old seropositive and PCR-negative subjects, 
the estimate of VE was 81.3% (95% CI: 14.4, 98.0). Based on these data, which are consistent with 
and similar to data from the efficacy studies in young women that show efficacy against both CIN and 
EGL, as well as persistent infection, the MAH has a claim of protection against recurrent HPV infection

in the Day 1 seropositive and PCR negative population and section 5.1 of the SmPC was updated with 
data from the post hoc analyses performed by the MAH. 
No  significant  efficacy  results  were  obtained  in  the  population  benefit  endpoints.  No  efficacy  against 
the  overall  burden  of  cervical  or  external  genital  HPV  disease  could  be  demonstrated.  The  qHPV 
vaccine was efficacious in preventing HPV 16/18-related Pap abnormalities of ASC-US positive for high-
risk HPV probe or worse in all study populations, but no significant efficacy could be shown against Pap 
abnormalities  due  to  any  HPV  type  or  in  the  reduction  in  the  incidence  of  cervical  or  external  genital 
procedures. The number of endpoints was insufficient to detect a statistically significant effect. 
Non-vaccine serotypes:  
There  was  no  imbalance in  acquisition  of  non-vaccine  HPV  type  CIN  2/3+  in  the  vaccine  and  placebo 
groups  during  the  additional  follow-up  through  EOS.  The  original  imbalance  observed  in  the  2007 
endpoint-driven  analysis  was  due  to  an  imbalance  in  prevalent  infection  at  Day  1  between  the  two 
groups.  The  65  cases  (vaccine  =  40,  placebo  =  25)  of  CIN  2/3+  related  to  non-vaccine  HPV  types 
observed in the FAS: i) do not represent evidence suggesting that the qHPV vaccine allows non-vaccine 
HPV  type  disease  to  replace  vaccine  HPV  type-related  disease  in  vaccinated  subjects;  and  ii)  do  not 
support a view that the qHPV vaccine accelerates progression of existing non-vaccine HPV type-related 
infection  to  pre-cancerous  lesions  in  subjects  vaccinated  with  the  qHPV  vaccine.  No  cross-protective 
could  be  demonstrated,  probably  due  to  the  sample  size  and  the  relative  lack  of  power  to  detect  a 
significant result. 
The collection of data on possible HPV type replacement in the MAW population will only be performed 
in the 019 study in Columbia. The conditions are not ideal since the Columbian cohort is very limited 
and there will be no population-based data on background HPV types available. However, the observed 
HPV  types  after  vaccination  will  be  compared  with  data  from  another  population  in  Bogota.  This 
approach  will  probably  be  informative.  In  addition,  HPV  type  replacement  will  be  studied  in  the  YAW 
population  in  two  large  studies  from  which  data  to  some  degree  may  be  extrapolated  to  the  MAW 
population.  It  is  noted  that  an  overview  on  how  the  MAH  plans  to  assess  the  potential  occurrence  of 
type  replacement  following  vaccination  with  qHPV vaccine is  detailed in  the current  risk management 
plan. An updated version of the RMP will be submitted in June 2010. The type replacement issue will 
therefore be the subject of further discussion. 
In conclusion the results at end of study of Protocol 019 confirmed the efficacy of the qHPV vaccine in  
mid-adult women 24 to 45 years of age. Long-term follow up of efficacy for a duration of at least 10 
years will be performed in the Colombian cohort of study 019

Immunogenicity 
Protocol 019 included the immunogenicity evaluation. The study enrolled a total of 3819 subjects in 2 
approximately  equal  age  strata  (24-  to  34-year-olds  and  35-  to  45-year-olds).  All  subjects  were  to 
undergo  serology  testing  for  anti-HPV  6,  anti-HPV 11,  anti-HPV  16,  and  anti-HPV  18  levels  at  Day  1, 
and  Months  7,  12,  24,  36,  and  48.  The  primary immunogenicity  evaluations  were  to  be  conducted  in 
the per-protocol immunogenicity (PPI) population. The 2007 endpoint driven analysis presented results 
from  all  visits  through  13-July-2007  (corresponding  primarily  to  the  Day  1,  Month  7  and  Month  24 
visits). The new results presented in this end-of-study report pertain to immunogenicity responses at 
Months 12, 36, and 48 and maternal transfer of anti-HPV (exploratory immunogenicity objective).

1.3.1  Methods 
The below characteristics are specific for the immunogenicity analysis. 
Study population 
Per-Protocol immunogenicity (PPI) population 
The  per-protocol  population  for  immunogenicity  (PPI)  analysis  generally  included  subjects  who  were 
seronegative  and  PCR  negative  to  the  relevant  HPV  type(s)  at  Day  1,  remained  HPV  PCR  negative 
through 1 month post dose 3 (month 7), received all 3 vaccinations within pre-specified time intervals, 
and no deviation from the study protocol. 
Exploratory immunogenicity populations 
Day 1 seronegative and PCR positive (S0P1) 
Day 1 seropositive and PCR negative (S1P0) 
Day 1 seropositive and PCR positive (S1P1) 
Objectives 
The immunogenicity objectives were: 
To  evaluate  the  kinetics  and  age  dependence  of  anti-HPV  6,  11,  16,  and  18  responses  following 
administration of a 3-dose regimen of qHPV vaccine  
To observationally compare anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, and 18 responses following administration of a 3-dose 
regimen  of  qHPV  vaccine among  HPV-naïve  women  24  to  45  years  of  age  enrolled  in  P019  and  HPV-
naïve  women  16  to  23  years  of  age  from  P011,  P012  (substudies  of  P013)  and  the  Consistency  Lot 
substudy of P015.  
The immunogenicity of the HPV vaccines was measured using the method competitive Luminex-based 
immunoassay (cLIA). The method was requalified as cLIA version 2. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The immunogenicity endpoints for the clinical program have focused on 2 parameters:  
Anti-HPV levels (geometric mean titers [GMTs]),  
The proportion of subjects who became seropositive to each of the 4 HPV antigens 4 weeks after the 
third dose.  
The immunogenicity time points of interest were: 
Month  7:  The  primary  immunogenicity  endpoint  was  anti-HPV  6,  11,  16  and  18  serum  cLIA  levels  at 
Month  7  in  the  defined  PPI  population,  as  this  time  point  reflected  the  time  frame  during  which  peak 
vaccine-induced immune responses were expected.   
Persistence  time  points. Depending  on the  protocol,  subjects  underwent  serology  testing at  6-  to  48-
month  intervals  following  the  Month  7  visit.    The  data  collected  at  these  time  points  were  used  to 
evaluate the durability of vaccine-induced anti-HPV responses.

Results 
GMTs 
Table  14  shows  the  anti-HPV  6,  anti-HPV  11,  anti-HPV  16,  and  anti-HPV  18  geometric  mean  titers 
(GMTs)  for  each  of  the  vaccine  group  and  placebo  group  in  the  per-protocol  immunogenicity  (PPI) 
population at Day 1, Month 7, Month 12, and every 12 months thereafter through Month 48. 
For each of the vaccine HPV types, and at all the time points evaluated, the GMTs in the placebo group 
were below the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of the assay. 
In the vaccine group for each vaccine HPV type, measurable immune responses well above the LLOQ 
were induced by a 3-dose vaccination of qHPV vaccine at Month 7 (table 14 ). For each of anti-HPV-6, -
11, -16, and -18, the GMTs declined from Month 7 through Month 24. The Month 24 GMTs were then 
sustained through Month 48.

The percent seroconversion at Month 7 was at least 97% for each of the vaccine HPV types. 
For each of anti-HPV-6, -11, and -16, the percent seropositive at Month 7 declined by no more than 10 
percentage points through Month 48. 
For  anti-HPV  18,  the  percent  seroconversion  at  Month  7  declined  by  approximately  50  percentage 
points through Month 48 and the percentage seropositive was 47.9%. 
Vaccine-type anti-HPV responses by age group in the HPV naïve population  
When  analysed  by  age  strata  no  significant  differences  in  the  distribution  of  anti-HPV  GMTs  or 
seroconversion  rates  were  observed.  The  antibody  decay  profile  by  time  was  similar  in  both  age 
groups. Overall the distribution of HPV titers was slightly lower in the 35 to 45 year-olds compared to 
24  to  34  year-olds.  At  Month  48,  50.7%  of  the  younger  women  and  45%  of  the  older  remained 
seropositive to HPV 18. 
Comparison of 16 to 23 year-olds and 25 to 45 year-olds 
The  vaccine-induced  anti-HPV  GMTs  were  lower  (except  for  anti-HPV  16)  in  MAW  compared  with  the 
younger women, both at Month 7 and Month 24. The GMTs decreased as the age progressed and were 
lowest in the 35 to 45 age stratum. At the current stage, the clinical relevance of the decreased GMTs 
in MAW is not known, since no immunological correlate of protection has been identified.

The  seroconversion  rate  for  each  HPV  vaccine  type  was  generally  comparable  in  all  age  groups  at 
Month 7, but was somewhat lower at Month 24 in the older age groups. For HPV 18, the seropositivity 
rate at Month 48 was 61% in women 16 to 23 years of age, 51% in women 23 to 34 years of age and 
45% in women 35 to 45 years of age. 
Vaccine HPV type anti-HPV responses in populations with prior HPV exposure 
Seropositive/PCR negative population (S1P0) 
At Day 1 anti-HPV GMTs were comparable in the two vaccination groups. At Month 7 the GMTs in the 
vaccine  group  increased  at  greater  magnitude  compared  to  those  in  the  HPV-naïve,  S1P1  and  S0P1 
populations.  In  general,  for  each  of  HPV  types  6,  11,  16,  and  18,  the  distribution  of  anti-HPV  in  this 
population declined from Month 7 through Month 24, and the distribution of anti-HPV at Month 24 was 
sustained through Month 48. The antibody levels were higher than those in the HPV naïve women at all 
time points. However, the sample size was very small compared to the sample size of the HPV naïve 
population. 
Seropositive/PCR positive population (S1P1) 
The number of evaluable patients was limited. In the placebo group GMTs were somewhat higher than 
those  observed  in  the  seropositive/PCR  negative  group.  The  results  showed  that  the  antibody  levels 
were higher than those in HPV naïve women at all times. 
Seronegative/PCR positive population(S0P1) 
The  number  of  evaluable  patients  was  small.  In  general  the  anti-HPV  GMTs  were  lower  than  those 
observed in the seropositive populations.  It is to be noted that the trends observed are not necessarily 
robust due the very small sample size of the Day 1 seronegative and PCR positive population. 
Analysis of maternal transfer of Anti-HPV 
This investigation aimed at characterising the titer of anti-HPV type 6/11 in both peripartum maternal 
blood and in cord blood of infants born to women who received blinded therapy in P019 in Thailand and 
the  Philippines.  It  was  a  pre-specified  exploratory  immunogenicity  objective  in  P019.  There  were  a 
total of 44 subjects with mother-infant serology data of which 24 originated from the vaccinated group 
and  20  from  the  placebo  group.  The  maternal  serum  and  cord  blood  samples  were  obtained  at  a 
median time of 28 months post-dose 3. 
The  results  showed  that  for  each  of  HPV  types  6,  11,  16  and  18  maternal  anti-HPV  was  detected  in 
cord blood samples. Moreover, HPV titers in cord blood samples were highly positively correlated with 
maternal HPV titers.  
1.3.3 Discussion 
The vaccine induced a significant Month 7 immune response to all HPV 6, 11, 16 and 18 types in MAW 
and  seroconversion  rate  was  above  97%  for  each  of  the  vaccine  HPV  types. The  strongest  responses 
were demonstrated against HPV 16 and the weakest response to HPV 18. At Month 24 the GMTs had 
decreased  substantially,  in  particular  with  respect  to  anti-HPV  18  (GMT:  28mMU/mL),  but  then 
remained stable until Month 48 including for anti-HPV 18 (23 mMU/mL). The antibody level for HPV18 
at  Month  24-48  is  below  that  measured  in  naturally  infected  subjects  (37  mMU/mL).  The  percent 
seroconversion  was  maintained  above  91%  through Month  48  for  anti-HPV 6,  11  and  16.  In  contrast 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 26/33 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
for HPV 18, only 48% of the subjects were still seropositive at Month 48.  Despite the nominal loss of 
seropositivity, no cases of HPV 18 infection or disease were observed in the PPE population during the 
4  year  follow-up  period.  In  the  HNRT  population,  there  was  one  case  of  HPV  18  persistent  infection 
that started during the vaccine period Day 1 and Month 7. 
In  the  previous  2007  procedure  the  MAH  addressed  the  issue  regarding  the  choice  of  serological 
testing  methodology.  The  currently  used  serological  cLIA  assay  may  not  be  the  optimal  method  to 
measure  long-term  vaccine  induced  HPV  immunity.  This  assay  might  be  too  specific  measuring  only 
antibodies  against  a  single  type-specific  neutralizing  epitope  on  L1  VLPs  and  not  all  relevant 
neutralizing  antibodies.  Therefore,  the  MAH  have  committed  to  perform  serological  studies  using 
broader  neutralization  assays,  i.e.  pseudo-neutralization  assays  (see  letter  of  undertaking),  and 
submitted the validation protocol and final results using the newly developed assay measuring the VLP-
specific total IgG. 
When analysed by the two pre-specified age strata, no significant differences in the distribution of anti-
HPV  GMTs  or  seroconversion  rates  were  observed.  The  antibody  decay  profile  by  time  was  similar  in 
both  age  groups.  Overall  the  distribution  of  HPV  titers  was  slightly  lower  in  the  35  to  45  year-olds 
compared  to  24  to  34  year-olds.  At  Month  48,  50.7%  of  the  younger  women  and  45%  of  the  older 
remained seropositive to HPV 18.  
The study demonstrated that administration of the vaccine to baseline HPV vaccine-type naïve 24- to 
45-year-old women resulted in anti-HPV 6/11/16/18 responses at Month 7 that were lower than those 
observed in 16- to 23- year-old (non-overlapping 95% CIs up to Month 24). The exception was anti-
HPV  16  GMTs  that  were  comparable  between  the  two  age  groups.  The  GMTs  decreased  as  the  age 
progressed and were lowest in the 35 to 45 age stratum. At the present time, the clinical relevance of 
the  decreased  GMTs  in  MAW  is  not  known,  since  no  immunological  correlate  of  protection  has  been 
identified.  The  seroconversion  rate  for  each  HPV  vaccine  type  was  generally  comparable  in  all  age 
groups  at  Month  7,  but  was  somewhat  lower  at  Month  24  in  the  older  age  groups.  For  HPV  18,  the 
seropositivity  rate  at  Month  48  was  61%  in  women  16  to  23  years  of  age,  51%  in  women  23  to  34 
years of age and 45% in women 35 to 45 years of age. 
Subjects who were positive to the relevant HPV type at baseline had substantially higher GMTs. These 
data suggest the qHPV vaccine induces an anamnestic response in individuals seropositive as a result 
of prior natural infection.  
In  an  exploratory  analysis  maternal-infant  transfer  of  anti-HPV  antibodies  was  demonstrated  at  a 
median of 28 months postdose 3 and showed high correlation coefficients for all HPV types. The clinical 
significance  of  the  antibody  titers  measured  in  the  cord  blood  of  infants  is  not  known  since 
immunological correlates of protection have not been established. 
In conclusion the vaccine-induced immune responses in MAW seem robust, but were lower than those 
observed in younger 16- to 23- year-old women. The consequence of these lower antibody responses 
in  MAW  for  long-term  efficacy  is  not  known  since  no  minimum  anti-HPV  level  that  confers  protection 
has  been  defined.  The low  persistence  of  GMTs  and seropositivity  for  HPV 18  at  end-of-study  did  not 
translate  into  loss  of  efficacy,  but  will  have  to  be  closely  monitored  in  the  future.  The  MAH  has 
committed  to  conduct  a  10-year  follow-up  of  Protocol  019  in  Columbia  to  evaluate  long  term 
immunogenicity and efficacy in mid-adult women, which is satisfactory. The MAH has also committed 
to apply broader neutralization assays to further characterize the vaccine induced immune responses.

1.4  Clinical safety 
The  post-marketing  experience  with  qHPV  vaccine  is  summarised  from  the  International  Birthdate  (1 
June 2006) in 6-monthly PSUR's. More than 51,000,000 doses of this vaccine were distributed as of 31 
May  2009,  data  lock  point  of  the  most  recent  PSUR.  The  post  licensure  experiences  with  the  vaccine 
collected through passive reporting of spontaneous adverse experiences to the MAH has shown a low 
frequency of reported serious adverse experiences. 
The MAH submitted complete summaries for all new fatal and nonfatal SAEs and discontinuations due 
to an adverse experience not reported in the Protocol 019 CSR for safety data (interim report) and new 
medical history collected through 23 June 2009. In addition, the complete summaries for pregnancies 
and lactation outcomes were provided. 
1.4.1 Protocol 019 
Patient exposure 
The Safety Population is defined as all subjects who were enrolled in P019 and who received at least 
one vaccination. This population included 3810 subjects (1908 subjects who received qHPV vaccine and 
1902 subjects who received placebo). 
The  new  data  in  the  current  submission  are  adverse  events  reported  during  the  follow-up  period  till 
end of the study i.e. from July 14, 2007 till June 23, 2009. 
The  final  study  visit  associated  with  the  end-of-study  (i.e.  the  last  visit  in  which  last  subject  who 
required  follow-up  for  an  HPV-related  abnormality  observed  on  an  end-of  study  visit)  occurred  on  30 
April 2009. The last date in which pregnancy outcomes data were collected was 23 June 2009. 
Adverse events 
A  total  of  14  (0.7%)  subjects  who  received  qHPV  vaccine  and  16  (0.8%)  of  subjects  who  received 
placebo experienced a Serious Adverse Experience at any time during the study. 
During  the  period  13  July  2007  until  23  June  2009,  there  was  1  non-related  SAE's  in  the  1  vaccine 
group  and  2  in  the  placebo  group.  There  were  no  Serious  Adverse  Experiences  judged  by  the  study 
investigator  to  be  vaccine-related.  The  vaccination  groups  were  also  comparable  with  respect  to  the 
types of serious adverse experiences reported. The most common serious adverse experiences in both 
vaccination groups were infections and pregnancy complications. Overall, 9 subjects discontinued from 
the  study  due  to  an  adverse  experience.  Of  these  subjects  7  (0.4%)  received  qHPV  vaccine  and  2 
(0.1%) received placebo. 
CHMP variation assessment report

Serious adverse events and deaths 
Deaths 
A total of 8 deaths have been reported in Protocol 019 as of 23 June 2009. A total of 7 deaths (0.4%) 
have been reported in the qHPV group and 1 death (0.1%) has been reported in the placebo group. All 
deaths in the study were determined by the investigator to be "definitely not" related to the vaccine. 
Since the interim CSR for Protocol 019, there are 3 additional subjects with fatal adverse experiences. 
All  3  were  in  the  qHPV  group.  In  none  of  the  described  3  additional  fatal  events  which  occurred  in 
connection  with  a  history  of  administration  of  qHPV  vaccine  was  a  close  temporal  relationship  to 
administration of dose 3 and the fatal events were considered not to be related to study therapy. 
Serious adverse events 
In  addition  to  the  8  fatalities,  24  subjects  (9  in  the  qHPV  group  and  15  in  the  placebo  group) 
experienced  nonfatal  serious  clinical  adverse  experiences  during  the  entire  study  period.  Since  the 
endpoint-driven  CSR,  there  have  been  3  additional  subjects  with  nonfatal  serious  clinical  adverse 
experiences.  One  is  in  the  group  that  received  qHPV  (cervical  bleeding)  and  2  are  in  the  group  that 
received  placebo  (cervical  bleeding  and  vaginal  bleeding).  The  described  adverse  events  were  all 
considered to be related to study procedure i.e. cervical biopsies as part of the study protocol but not 
to the study therapy. 
New medical history in the safety population 
The most commonly reported new medical conditions during the Day 1 to Month 7 and the post Month 
7 follow-up period, respectively were infections such as bacterial vaginosis, nasopharyngitis, and upper 
respiratory tract infection; with similar incidence in both groups. 
Safety in special groups  
The  proportions  of  subjects  who  reported  new  medical  history  consistent  with  potential  autoimmune 
phenomena were comparable between the vaccination group. 
The AE non-specific arthritis/arthropathy is specifically addressed in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Two new 
cases  of  arthritis  were  reported  in  the  qHPV  vaccination  group  and  1  new  case  in  the  placebo  group. 
Although listed such events should be continuously monitored and reported on in future PSURs, 
Pregnancy 
Overall, 499 subjects (~13% of the study population) reported at least one pregnancy from Day 1 to 
23 June 2009. At the time of the closing of the study database for this EOS analyses, outcomes were 
available for 95.3% of pregnancies in the qHPV vaccine group and 96.0% of pregnancies in the placebo 
group. 
The  proportions  of  pregnancies  resulting  in  fetal  loss  were  comparable  between  the  2  vaccination 
groups.  A  total  of  12  congenital  anomalies  were  reported  for  pregnancies  (live  births,  fetal  losses)  in 
subjects  in  Protocol  019.  Of  these,  6  were  in  infants  and  2  in  a  fetus  of  subjects  in  the  group  that 
received  qHPV  vaccine  and  5  were  in  infants  and  1  in  a  fetus  of  subject  in  the  group  that  received 
placebo.  New  congenital  anomalies  were  reported  in  4  infants  and  1  fetus  of  subjects  who  received 
qHPV  vaccine  (1  infant  each  with  ankyloglossia,  Meckel’s  diverticulum,  mesenteric  cyst,  syndactyly, 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 29/33 
 
 
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and  trisomy  21).  New  congenital  anomalies  were  reported  in  3  infants  and  1  fetus  of  subjects  who 
received placebo (1 each of inguinal hernia, patent ductus arteriosus, pulmonary artery stenosis, and 
trisomy 13, Turner’s syndrome). None of these observed congenital anomalies, however, indicated any 
safety signal which could be considered related to the study therapy. 
Since  the  primary  endpoint  analysis  in  2007  (interim  report),  246  new  pregnancies  were  reported  in 
194 subjects (97 in the qHPV group and 97 in the placebo group.  During the whole study, a slightly 
smaller proportion of subjects in the qHPV vaccine group became pregnant compared with the placebo 
group (12.4% vs. 13.8% respectively). The proportions of pregnancies resulting in live birth and fetal 
loss  were  comparable  in  the  group  that  received  qHPV  vaccine  compared  with  the  placebo  group 
(78.9%  versus  76.9%,  and  18.8%  versus  21.4%  for  subjects  receiving  qHPV  vaccine  and  placebo, 
respectively).  
The proportions of pregnancies with natural outcomes that ended in a negative outcome were 19.1% 
(49/257) in the group that received qHPV vaccine and 20.3% (56/276) in the placebo group.  
Administration of qHPV vaccine to lactating women 
No SAEs were reported among subjects who were breast-feeding during the study. 
Discussion 
The present safety data support the conclusion that qHPV vaccine is generally well tolerated in 24-45 
year  old  women.  There  were  no  new  vaccine-related  serious  adverse  experiences.  No  safety  signals 
have  been  identified  with  the  exception  of  the previously  observed  increased  incidences of  transient 
injection-site adverse experiences and low-grade fever following vaccination. Use of qHPV vaccine did 
not  impact  overall  pregnancy  outcomes.  Administration  of  qHPV  vaccine  to  nursing  mothers  did  not 
affect  the  health  of  the  mother  or  the  nursing  child.  The  additional  data  obtained  in  the  follow-up  of 
Protocol-019 further confirm the profile observed before. 
Additionally  the  MAH  committed  to  update  the  CHMP  with  regard  to  the  feasibility  of  extending  to  45 
years of age the ongoing PGRx studies. The objective of the ongoing PGRx studies is to assess whether 
the use of Gardasil is associated with a modified risk for 8 autoimmune diseases in females aged 14-26 
years old, residing in France (see letter of undertaking). 
1.5  Pharmacovigilance system 
1.5.1 Risk Management Plan 
The  MAH  has  submitted  a  revised  Risk  Management  Plan  (version  4)  in  December  2009.  The  revised 
RMP  has  been  adequately  updated  in  relation  to  the  extension  of  the  indication  to  mid-adult  women, 
including  a  commitment  to  perform  a  long-term  observational  study  on  viral  type  replacement,  long-
term effectiveness/immunogenicity and long-term safety in Columbia. The assessment of the outline of 
this study protocol is ongoing. Furthermore the MAH has submitted a further revision of the RMP that is 
under evaluation.

1.6  Overall discussion and benefit-risk assessment 
The  results  at  end  of  study  confirmed  and  extended  the  efficacy  of  the  qHPV  vaccine  in  MAW 
demonstrated in the 2007 endpoint driven analysis. The qHPV vaccine was highly efficacious in the PPE 
population with respect to the relevant endpoints, persistent infection, CIN and EGL. High efficacy was 
observed with respect to HPV 16 and HPV 18 individually, with respect to persistent infection alone and 
with  respect  to  disease  endpoints  (CIN,  AIS,  or  EGL)  alone.  There  were  no  new  cases  of  HPV 
6/11/16/18-related CIN or EGL reported in the qHPV group since the first analysis. Hence, the results 
in  study  019  showed  significant  vaccine  efficacy  in  HPV  naïve  MAW  and  in  similar  magnitude  as  that 
shown  in  YAW.  In  the  FAS  population  improved  efficacy  results  were  demonstrated  during  the 
additional 2-year follow-up. The efficacy estimates against HPV 16/18-related PI/disease endpoint now 
reached statistical significance. There were a total of 48 (qHPV=21, placebo =27) cases of vaccine type 
related CIN 2/3 in the FAS population with no new cases in the vaccine group since the first analysis. 
The issues raised during the previous regulatory procedure, which included efficacy against HPV 16/18-
related  persistent  infection  by  duration  of  infection  (6  or  12  months),  relevance  of  the  HPV  6/11-
related persistent infection endpoint, poor vaccine efficacy in the FAS population, delayed clearance of 
HPV 16 infection in the Day 1 PCR positive and seronegative population of the vaccine group, and the 
potential  of  vaccine-induced  acceleration  of  disease  and  of  replacement  by  non-vaccine  types,  were 
properly addressed.  
The  vaccine-induced  immune  responses  in  MAW  were  robust,  but  lower  than  those  observed  in 
younger 16- to 23- year-old women. The consequence of these lower antibody responses in MAW for 
long-term  efficacy  is  not  known  since  no  minimum  anti-HPV  level  that  confers  protection  has  been 
defined.  The  low  persistence  of  GMTs  and  seropositivity  for  HPV  18  at  end-of-study  did  not  translate 
into loss of efficacy, but need to be closely monitored in the future. The MAH has already committed to 
conduct  a  10-year  follow-up  of  Protocol  019  in  Columbia  to  evaluate  long  term  immunogenicity  and 
efficacy  in  mid-adult  women,  which  is  satisfactory.  The  MAH  has  also  already  committed  to  apply 
broader neutralization assays to further characterize the vaccine induced immune responses (see letter 
of undertaking). 
Administration  of  qHPV  vaccine  is  generally  well  tolerated  in  24-  to  45-year-old  women.  The  present 
safety  data  support  the  conclusion  that  qHPV  vaccine  is  well  tolerated  and  displays  a  safety  profile 
similar  to  that  shown  in  previous  submissions.  No  safety  signals  have  been  identified  with  the 
exception  of  increased  incidences  of  transient  injection-site  adverse  experiences  and  low-grade  fever 
following  vaccination.  There  were  no  new  vaccine-related  serious  adverse  experiences  in  the  present 
report. Additionally the MAH committed to update the CHMP with regard to the feasibility of extending 
to 45 years of age the ongoing PGRx studies (see letter of undertaking). 
The revised RMP version 4 in relation to the extension of the indication to mid-adult women has been 
adequately updated, including a commitment to perform a long-term observational study on viral type 
replacement, long-term effectiveness/immunogenicity and long-term safety in Columbia (see letter of 
undertaking). The assessment of the  outline of the study protocol is on going. Annex II was updated 
with the revised version of the RMP. 
The overall expected benefit of the qHPV vaccine in mid-adult women is lower than in the young adult 
women population, due to the higher level of baseline sero-/PCR-positivity and the much lower risk of 
acquiring of new HPV infection at older ages. However, based on the result in Protocol 019 it is evident 
that efficacy in HPV naïve older women is of the same magnitude as that in young adult women. Since 
the overall expected benefit of the qHPV vaccine in mid-adult women is lower than in the young adult 
women  population  the  CHMP  considered  important  to  alert  the  prescribers  that  HPV  exposure  and 
potential benefit should be considered in the decision to vaccinate an individual adult women. Further

important information for prescribers already mentioned in the product information include statements 
that  the  vaccine  does  not  protect  against  all  HPV  types  and  therefore  it  is  critical  that  the  women 
continue to attend routine cervical screening according to local recommendations and that Gardasil is 
for prophylactic use only and has no effect on active HPV infections or established clinical disease. 
The  product  information  was  updated  to  reflect  these  data  as  detailed  in  section  3.7  and  the  above 
mentioned commitments were included in the letter of undertaking. 
1.7  Changes to the product information 
Further to the assessment of the different proposals of the MAH to amend the Product Information and 
in the light of the assessment of the submitted data, the Product Information was revised as follows: 
Summary of Product Characteristics 
Section 4.1 “Therapeutic indication”  
The  MAH’s  applied  to  extend  the  age  of  the  indication  for  women  up  to  45  years  old,  based  on 
submission of 4 years data of study 019. Furthermore the CHMP took the opportunity of this variation 
to simplify the wording of the indication and to harmonise it between the HPV vaccines. 
Since  statistically  significant  efficacy  results  in  the  primary  HPV16/18-related  endpoint  were 
demonstrated  in  the  ITT  population  at  end-of  study  (the  general  mid-adult  population  that  will  be 
vaccinated in clinical practice) the indication was revised to include the vaccination of women from the 
age of 9 years on wards. 
To harmonise the indication between the HPV vaccines and to simplify the wording of the indication the 
vaccine HPV types were replaced by “certain oncogenic HPV types” since for both vaccines some cross 
protection  against  related  non-vaccine  HPV  types  have  been  demonstrated.  The  CHMP  included  the 
word “certain” to make prescribers aware that the vaccine does not protect against all HPV oncogenic 
types. The information on the different HPV types is covered by a cross reference to section 5.1 where 
these data are presented. 
The  paragraph  detailing  the  basis  for the  indication:  “the  indication is  based  on  the  demonstration of 
efficacy  of  Gardasil  in  females  16  to 26  years  of age  and  on  the  demonstration  of immunogenicity of 
Gardasil  in  9-  to  15-year  old  children  and  adolescents.  Protective  efficacy  has  not  been  evaluated  in 
males.” was amended with the new data up to 45 years and moved to section 5.1. This paragraph was 
not considered necessary any longer in the indication since data were submitted for mid adult women 
and since a cross reference to sections 4.4 and 5.1 for important information on the data that support 
this indication was included in this section. 
Therefore the new indication is as follows: 
“Gardasil is a vaccine for use from the age of 9 years for the prevention of: 
-  premalignant  genital  lesions  (cervical,  vulvar  and  vaginal)  and  cervical  cancer  causally  related  to 
certain oncogenic Human Papillomavirus (HPV) types 
- external genital warts (condyloma acuminata) causally related to specific HPV types. 
See sections 4.4 and 5.1 for important information on the data that support this indication. 
The use of Gardasil should be in accordance with official recommendations.”

Section 4.4 “Special warnings and precautions for use”  
Since  the  data  at  end-of  study  after  4  years  of  follow-up  now  demonstrate  statistically  significant 
vaccine efficacy in the FAS population for mid-adult women the relevant sentence based on the 2007 
endpoint driven analysis was removed from this section. 
Since the overall expected benefit of the qHPV vaccine is lower in sexually experienced women than in 
HPV  naïve  children/adolescents  and  substantially  lower  in  mid-adult  women  than  in  the  young  adult 
women population the CHMP considered important to alert prescribers that HPV exposure and potential 
benefit  should  be  considered  in  the  decision  to  vaccinate  an  individual  adult  women.  Therefore,  the 
following sentence was modified and moved to the beginning of this section: “the decision to vaccinate 
an  individual  woman  should  take  into  account  her  risk  for  previous  HPV  exposure  and  her  potential 
benefit from vaccination”. 
Section 4.6 “Pregnancy and lactation” 
The MAH proposal to revise the numbers of women in the clinical development program that reported 
pregnancy was endorsed by the CHMP. 
Section 4.8 “Undesirable effects” 
The CHMP endorsed the update of the numbers in the safety population. 
Section 5.1 “Pharmacodynamic properties”  
The  following  paragraph:  “the  indication  is  based  on  the  demonstration  of  efficacy  of  Gardasil  in 
females 16 to 45 years of age and on the demonstration of immunogenicity of Gardasil in 9- to 15-year 
old  children  and  adolescents.  Protective  efficacy  has  not  been  evaluated  in  males.”  was  moved  from 
section 4.1 to this section and updated based on new data. 
Efficacy in woman 24 through 45 years was updated with results from the PPE and FAS analyses after 
a follow up of 4 years. 
Data  from  post-hoc  analyses  of  efficacy  against  recurrent  infection  in  women  (16  to  45  years)  with 
evidence  of  a  prior  infection  with  a  vaccine  HPV  type  (seropositive)  that  was  no  longer  detectable  at 
vaccination onset (PCR negative) were introduced. 
The data on immunogenicity were updated. 
In  addition,  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder  (MAH)  took  the  opportunity  to  introduce  other  minor 
changes to the SmPC. 
Package Leaflet 
The PL was updated to reflect the change in the indication. 
Annex II was updated with the new version of the risk management plan. 
2.  Conclusion 
On 24 June 2010 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet.

2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study GS-US-334-1113 
Description 
This study enrolled adolescent and paediatric participants who received at least 1 of 4 of the MAH’s hepatitis 
C virus (HCV) direct acting antivirals (DAAs) SOF, LDV/SOF, SOF/VEL and SOF/VEL/VOX while participating in 
MAH-sponsored chronic hepatitis C clinical studies regardless of whether the participant achieved a sustained 
virologic response (SVR). Once enrolled, participants were followed for up to 5 years.  
Methods 
Study participants 
Inclusion Criteria 
Subjects met all of the following inclusion criteria to be eligible for participation in the registry:  
1.  Have previously participated in a MAH-sponsored chronic hepatitis C study as an adolescent or 
paediatric subject and received at least one of MAH’s HCV DAAs;  
2.  Parent or legal guardian able to provide written, informed consent and willing to comply with the visit 
schedule and subject able to provide written assent, if they have the ability to read and write, as 
determined by IRB/IEC/local requirements and Investigator’s discretion, OR subject either able to 
provide written assent, if they have the ability to read and write, as determined by IRB/IEC/local 
requirements and Investigator’s discretion.  
Exclusion Criteria  
Subjects who meet any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in this registry.  
1.  Subject is currently receiving or plans to initiate a new course of hepatitis C therapy including any 
investigational drug or device during the course of the follow-up registry.  
Treatments 
This was a long-term follow-up registry study and no investigational medicinal product was administered. The 
HCV regimens prior received in the parent studies was used as treatment groups for analysis purpose. All the 
parent studies included in this registry are GS-US-334-1112, GS-US-337-1116, GS-US-342-1143, and GS-
US-367-1175.

Objectives and outcomes/endpoints 
This observational registry followed participants for up to 5 years, or until early discontinuation from the 
study. The Day 1 visit was documented as the last visit of the previous MAH-sponsored treatment protocol. 
Subsequent visits occurred at Weeks 24, 48, 72, 96, 144, 192, and 240. 
Assessments included (collected at each visit): 
•  Perform symptom-directed physical examination 
•  Body height and weight measurements 
•  Tanner Pubertal Stage assessment (if applicable) 
•  Complete QOL survey 
•  Obtain blood samples for: 
o  Plasma HCV RNA (if HCV RNA is detected after nondetectable levels at Day 1 or any time 
throughout the study, the participant will have a repeat blood sample drawn for confirmation) 
o  Viral sequencing (archive); for analysis if a participant who achieved SVR in the parent study 
has confirmed quantifiable HCV RNA after Day 1 and for persistence in participants who were 
viremic at the time of study enrollment 
•  Assessment of procedure-related adverse events (AEs)

Only AEs and serious adverse events (SAEs) considered to be related to study procedures as assessed by the 
investigator and mandated by the study protocol were reported under this study. Any treatment related SAEs 
were reported within the previous Gilead-sponsored treatment protocol. 
Participants who began a new treatment course for HCV infection discontinued participation in this study. 
Sample size 
Due to the observational nature of this study, no formal power, or sample size calculations were used. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Not applicable 
Statistical Methods 
Data from this study were summarized descriptively and statistical hypothesis testing was not conducted. All 
continuous variables were summarized using an 8-number descriptive summary (n, mean, standard 
deviation, and median, first quartile (Q1), third quartile (Q3), minimum, maximum) by visit. All categorical 
variables were summarized by number and percentage of participants in each categorical definition.  
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all enrolled participants who met all the study entry eligibility criteria and 
with at least 1 post-Day 1 (Day 1 was documented from the last visit in the initial MAH-sponsored treatment 
protocol, referred to as ‘parent study’) visit measurement available. The FAS was the primary analysis set for 
all analyses. Safety Analysis Set was the same as FAS in this study.  
Sustained virologic response duration in days = SVR end date in registry (for participants who did not 
maintain SVR) or last day of registry (for participants who maintained SVR) − SVR12 date in parent study + 
1.  
Virologic failure was defined as having 2 consecutive blood samples (at least one week apart) with HCV RNA 
more than the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ), or last available HCV RNA more than the LLOQ with no 
subsequent follow-up values.  
Primary Endpoints  
Body weight, height, body mass index (BMI), and the corresponding percentiles and Z-scores at each visit 
and change from baseline at each visit were summarized for the Safety Analysis Set by prior treatment 
group, sex, prior age group (based on the age at the entry of the parent treatment studies), and overall 
using descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, Q1, Q3, minimum, and maximum). A Wilcoxon signed-rank 
test was performed to evaluate if the median change from baseline for weight, height, BMI, and the 
corresponding percentiles and Z-scores at each postbaseline visit was different from zero.  
A categorical frequency table of weight/height/BMI Z-scores at each visit by prior treatment group, sex, and 
prior age group was summarized by 6 categories (< −2, ≥ −2 to < −1, ≥ −1 to < 0, ≥ 0 to < 1, ≥ 1 to < 2, or 
≥ 2). A categorical frequency table of weight/height/BMI percentile at each visit by prior treatment group, 
sex, and prior age group was also summarized by 3 categories (< fifth percentile, ≥ fifth to < 95th percentile, 
≥ 95th percentile).

A shift table of Tanner Stages at each postbaseline visit from baseline was provided by prior treatment group, 
sex, and prior age group. If the assessment within the MAH-sponsored parent protocol determined the 
participant was at a Tanner Stage 5 or once a participant reached Tanner Stage 5 in the registry study, no 
further Tanner Pubertal Stage assessments were completed, and the stage was counted as Stage 5 for all the 
following visits in analyses.  
Secondary Endpoints  
The proportion of participants maintaining SVR, proportions of participants with detectable HCV RNA following 
SVR due to re-emergence of pre-existing virus/development of resistance mutations/re-infection, and 
proportion of participants with detectable HCV resistance mutations among participants who had not achieved 
SVR in parent study were summarized based on the plasma HCV RNA and viral sequence analysis results.  
Exploratory Endpoint  
The scores from Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL™) Version 4.0 Short Form (SF-15) were 
summarized with descriptive statistics at each visit by prior treatment group and prior age group.  
Safety 
Safety analyses were based on the Safety Analysis Set and all safety data collected on or after the enrolment 
through the remainder of the study were included. As there was no study treatment in this study, only AEs 
related to the required procedures by this study protocol were reported under this study. All deaths, 
regardless of relatedness to study procedures were recorded when available.  
Due to disruption in study conduct as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, some assessments were not 
conducted.  
Results 
Participant flow 
•  There were 461 participants enrolled in the study.  
o  Four hundred twenty-six (92.4%) participants met the eligibility criteria and had available 
post-Day 1 visit measurements and were included in the FAS and Safety Analysis Sets (the 
primary analysis sets for endpoint analyses).  
o  Thirty-five participants were enrolled, met all the eligibility criteria, but did not have available 
post-Day 1 visit measurements and thus were excluded from the FAS and Safety Analysis 
Set.  
•  Among 426 participants analysed in FAS, 253 (59.4%) participants prematurely discontinued the 
study, while 173 (40.6%) participants completed the study through Week 240. Of these, 65.9% 
(58/88 participants) from the SOF+ribavirin (RBV) treatment group, 56.2% (100/178 participants) 
from the LDV/SOF±RBV treatment group, 10.6% (15/142 participants) from the SOF/VEL treatment 
group, and 0% (0/18 participants) from the SOF/VEL/VOX treatment group completed the study.  
•  The most common reason for premature discontinuation from the study was “Lost to Follow Up” for 
participants in SOF+RBV (15.9% [14/88 participants]) and LDV/SOF±RBV (28.7% [51/178

participants]) treatment groups, and “Study Terminated by Sponsor” for participants in the SOF/VEL 
(48.6% [69/142 participants]) and SOF/VEL/VOX (77.8% [14/18 participants]) treatment groups.  
This study is a Postmarketing Requirement (PMR) from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for SOF 
and LDV/SOF, which requires at least 3 years of follow-up data for paediatric subjects who were treated with 
SOF or LDV/SOF. In addition, this study was included in the EU Risk Management Plan (RMP) as a category 
‘missing information’ for SOF, SOF/VEL, and SOF/VEL/VOX. The MAH determined that the scientific objectives 
of the study would be met when all participants reached 3 years of follow-up as required in the US PMRs for 
SOF and LDV/SOF or had discontinued early. Consequently, when study closure occurred on 06th January 
2023, not all participants had reached up to 5 years of follow-up offered in the study, and clinical sites were 
instructed to follow the standardized eCRF Completion guidelines to mark the subject completion reason as 
“Study Terminated by Sponsor” for these participants. Overall, out of the 426 study participants in the safety 
analysis set, 302 (70.9%) completed Week 144, or 3 years, of follow-up. The table below shows the total 
number of participants that reached Week 144 by treatment received in the parent study.

Results based on change in Z-scores were similar and did not identify any impact of prior treatment with 
SOF-based regimen on height. 
Assessor's comment: 
No major changes from baseline in the weight, BMI or height percentiles were observed during the 
follow up study. Thus, treatment with DAAs (SOF+RBV, LDV/SOF±RBV, SOF/VEL, SOF/VEL/VOX) 
does not seem to notably affect long-term growth parameters.

Study GS-US-367-1175 (SOF/VEL/VOX) 
12 to < 18 years old 
No male or female participant had Week 240 assessments. 
Assessor's comment: 
The development and sexual maturation as assessed by changes from baseline through end of study 
in Tanner pubertal stages did not seem to be affected by treatment with DAAs. 
Secondary endpoints 
Proportion of participants maintaining SVR 
Out of 424 participants who had achieved SVR in their parent treatment study, all (100%) participants 
maintained SVR during this registry study.  
Two participants did not achieve SVR in their parent treatment studies and hence, no SVR duration was 
calculated. Hepatitis C virus sequencing was performed with blood samples collected during this registry 
study for these 2 participants (both with HCV Genotype 1a) in the FAS who had not achieved SVR in their 
parent treatment study.  
One participant treated with LDV/SOF for 12 weeks in the parent Study GS-US-337-1116 had the NS5A 
resistance-associate variant (RAV) Y93H which developed at Week 4 posttreatment. The Y93H RAV was 
maintained through Week 144. One participant treated with SOF/VEL for 12 weeks in the parent Study GS-
US-342-1143 had the NS5A RAV L31V which developed at Week 8 on treatment. The L31V RAV was not 
detected at Week 24 and Week 48, was detected as a mixture (L31L/V) at Week 72, then not detected at 
Week 96, 144, and 192. Both participants were tested for the presence of NS5B RAVs during the parent and 
registry study. No NS5B RAVs were detected in either participant during the parent or registry study at all 
tested visits.  
Table 6 summarizes the SVR duration of participants who achieved SVR in the parent study by treatment 
group. Overall, the mean (SD) SVR duration was 1359.0 (510.82) days.

Assessor's comment: 
Of the 424 participants with SVR24 in the parent study all maintained SVR during the follow up 
registry study. Two participants did not achieve SVR in the parent study and thus SVR was not 
calculated for the registry study. 
Exploratory endpoint 
Quality of life results 
Participant-reported outcomes were assessed using the PedsQL™ Version 4.0 Short Form (SF15). No clinically 
significant changes were observed from the registry baseline throughout the study.  
Adverse Events 
As there was no study treatment in this study, only adverse events (AEs) related to the required procedures 
by the study protocol were reported under this study. During the registry study, 1 participant experienced a 
Grade 1 nonserious AE of presyncope that was resolved on the day of onset without any corrective 
treatment. The AE was considered related to study procedures. No action was taken due to the AE.  
Deaths, Serious Adverse Events, and Discontinuations Due to Adverse Events 
No participant experienced a serious adverse event or an AE leading to premature study discontinuation.

One participant died during the study due to progressive cerebellar glioblastoma and the death was not 
considered related to study procedures. 
Postmarketing Experience 
Based on postmarketing experience to date, the safety profile of SOF, LDV/SOF, SOF/VEL, and SOF/VEL/VOX, 
in the paediatric population is consistent with their safety profile in adults. No new adverse drug reactions 
related to SOF, LDV/SOF, SOF/VEL, and SOF/VEL/VOX have been observed in paediatric patients in the 
postmarketing setting. No postmarketing data are submitted with this application.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This long-term follow up registry assessed safety data of growth and development in paediatric patients 
previously treated with SOF+RBV, LDV/SOF±RBV, SOF/VEL or SOF/VEL/VOX. 
The median (Q1, Q3) of duration on this registry study was 239.1 (179.0, 243.6) weeks for SOF+RBV, 238.6 
(142.6, 244.1) weeks for LDV/SOF±RBV, 168.5 (80.1, 193.7) weeks for SOF/VEL, and 143.1 (142.1, 144.0) 
weeks for SOF/VEL/VOX. No long-term effects of treatment on height, weight, BMI, Tanner pubertal stage, 
and SF15 scores were observed.  
For those participants with SVR in the parent study all maintained SVR during the follow up in the registry. 
No clinically significant safety signals have been identified in this long-term follow-up study. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
A favourable long-term safety profile was observed with SOF+RBV, LDV/SOF±RBV, SOF/VEL, SOF/VEL/VOX 
treatment in paediatric and adolescent participants with HCV infection in the follow up registry.  
No label update is proposed which is endorsed. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

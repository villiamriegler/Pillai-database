1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Alnylam Netherlands B.V. submitted on 27 June 2019 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Givlaari, through the centralised procedure falling 
within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised 
procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 23 February 2017.  
Givlaari was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/16/1731 on 29 August 2016 in the following 
condition: the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria. 
Givlaari was granted eligibility to PRIME on 23 February 2017 in the following indication: prevention of acute 
attacks of hepatic porphyria. 
Eligibility to PRIME was granted at the time in view of the following: 
• 
• 
• 
There was an unmet medical need for the prevention of acute attacks of hepatic porphyria as no licensed 
treatments for the prevention of acute hepatic porphyria attacks were available; general prophylactic 
measures applied do not prevent long-term severe morbidity and mortality; liver transplantation provides 
only an option of last resort and is associated with substantial risk. 
The non-clinical and preliminary clinical data presented suggested that givosiran had the potential to 
significantly address the unmet medical need as data showed robust and consistent activity in reducing 
ALAS1 transcription thereby reducing levels of ALA/PBG as the key accumulating toxic metabolites in 
patients with AHP.  
In the two cohorts presented, a 74% and 58% decrease in mean annualised attack-rate could be shown 
(versus reductions of 23-34% with placebo). Improvements were also shown in terms of increase in the 
number of attack-free days, reduction in the number of hospitalisations and use of analgesics. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: treatment of acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) in adults and 
adolescents aged 12 years and older. 
The legal basis for this application refers to Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent 
application.  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical and 
clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature substituting/supporting 
certain tests or studies. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal 
Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Givlaari as an orphan medicinal product in the approved 
indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the Orphan maintenance assessment 
report published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/givlaari.

Page 7/101 
  
  
 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0038/2019 on the granting of a product-specific waiver.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition related to 
the proposed indication. 
Applicant’s request for consideration 
Accelerated assessment 
The  applicant  requested  accelerated  assessment  in  accordance  to  Article  14  (9)  of  Regulation  (EC)  No 
726/2004. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance givosiran contained in the above medicinal product to be 
considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a medicinal 
product previously authorised within the European Union. 
PRIME support 
Upon granting of eligibility to PRIME, the Rapporteur was appointed by the CHMP. 
A kick-off meeting was subsequently organised with the EMA, Rapporteur, assessors’ team and experts from 
relevant scientific committees. The objective of the meeting was to discuss the development programme and 
regulatory strategy for the product. The applicant was recommended to address the following key issues 
through relevant regulatory procedures:  
Stereochemistry, level and types of impurities, proposed specification tests and limits for the drug substance, 
intermediates and drug product, initial risk assessment and QTTPs/CQAs, planned overall non-clinical 
programme and timing of submission of carcinogenicity data, dose selection, plans and timing of evaluations 
of patients with renal and hepatic impairment, correlation between the biomarker and clinical outcomes, 
interim analysis of phase 3 study, conditional marketing authorisation, safety, risk management plan and 
plans for long-term follow up.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Givlaari has been developed for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
Acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) is a family of rare, serious, and severely debilitating genetic disorders of the 
liver heme synthesis. An overall prevalence of AHP in Europe is estimated as 1.01 per 100,000 people, except 
in Sweden where AHP is somewhat more prevalent (2.3 per 100,000) due to a founder effect, with the 
majority of patients with the subtype acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) [Elder 2013]. AHP is an incompletely 
penetrant genetic disease; the frequency of loss of function mutations in the hydroxymethylbilane synthase 
(HMBS) gene is approximately 1 per 1600 to 1700 (approximately 60 per 100,000), but clinical penetrance of 
symptomatic disease is low due to the requirement of aminolevulinate synthase 1 (ALAS1) messenger 
ribonucleic acid (mRNA) induction in addition to a mutation in the heme synthetic pathway [Chen 2016; Elder 
2013; Nordmann 1997]. Onset of disease symptoms typically starts after puberty, with women 
(approximately 80%) more commonly affected than men [Balwani 2012; Bissell 2017; Elder 2013].   
Attacks are often triggered by exogenous factors such as medications (especially barbiturates, sulfonamides, 
and hydantoins), stress, hormones, caloric restriction, and infection. In women, attacks may occur around 
the menstrual cycle due to the significant hormonal changes at that time.  
Many AHP patients remain undiagnosed for years. Mean time to diagnosis is 15 years [Bonkovsky 2014] 
because the disease is rare and is characterized by nonspecific symptoms (e.g., diffuse abdominal pain and 
nausea) that are not always accompanied by abnormalities on physical examination or routine laboratory 
testing [Siegesmund 2010]. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
AHP is characterized by induced ALAS1 mRNA expression, increasing flux into the liver heme synthetic 
pathway and accumulation of neurotoxic aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG) in the setting 
of a loss-of-function gene mutation in a downstream enzyme [Bissell and Wang 2015; Puy 2010; Siegesmund 
2010]. 
There are 4 subtypes of AHP, each involving a defect in a distinct heme pathway enzyme: AIP caused by 
mutations in HMBS, also known as PBG deaminase; hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), caused by mutations in 
coproporphyrinogen oxidase; variegate porphyria (VP), caused by mutations in protoporphyrinogen oxidase; 
and aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD)-deficient porphyria (ADP), caused by mutations in ALAD 
[Anderson 2005; Bissell and Wang 2015]. While AIP is the most common AHP subtype, representing 
approximately 80% of all AHP cases, the pathophysiological mechanisms of all AHP subtypes are the same.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/70703/2020 
Page 11/101 
  
  
 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Patients with AHP can experience incapacitating, potentially life-threatening neurovisceral attacks and long-
term comorbidities [Bissell 2015]. Most severe AHP patients (5-10%) have recurrent attacks (≥ 4 per year). 
In the EXPLORE natural history study, patients reported a mean of 9.5 attacks per year with a range of 0 to 
54 attacks per year [Anderson 2016; Gouya 2017]. Porphyria attacks typically last 5 to 7 days, though some 
patients experience attacks lasting several weeks or longer [Stein 2013]. During attacks, patients experience 
severe incapacitating neurovisceral pain in the abdomen, back, and limbs usually accompanied by fatigue, 
nausea, and a constellation of clinical effects from injury to the nervous system, including motor weakness 
and mental status changes, autonomic instability (e.g., severe hypertension, tachycardia, diaphoresis), and 
in up to 20% of acute attacks, seizures [Albers 2004; Anderson 2016; Anderson 2005; APF_Transcript 2017; 
Balwani 2012; Bonkovsky 2014; Puy 2010; Simon 2018].The clinical manifestations and pain are often so 
severe during attacks that most patients typically require hospitalization for treatment [Kadish 2003]. Clinical 
presentations, including acute porphyria attacks, are similar between the AHP subtypes, owing to the 
common pathophysiologic basis of disease; however, patients with HCP and VP patients may also experience 
cutaneous symptoms (e.g., burning and blistering of the skin) independent of attacks due to accumulation of 
photosensitizing porphyrin precursors [Bissell 2015; Puy 2010]. 
There has also been increasing recognition that AHP patients have significant chronic disease manifestations 
that occur outside of the attack setting. Natural history studies performed in both the US (Porphyrias 
Consortium) and in Sweden with patients with AIP determined that 18% to 22% of patients with AIP 
experience chronic symptoms, most commonly pain (in the abdomen, back, or limbs) and fatigue [Andersson 
2003; Bonkovsky 2014]. Data from the EXPLORE natural history study, which was conducted in a severely 
affected AHP patient population, determined that 64% of patients have chronic symptoms, most commonly 
pain, nausea, tiredness, and anxiety, with approximately 50% of patients experiencing daily symptoms. 
Chronic pain requires the regular administration of opioids in many patients. Porphyria disease activity 
negatively impacts quality of life and physical functioning. Due to unpredictability and severity of porphyria 
disease manifestations, many patients are unable to work or attend school, have decreased socialization, and 
increased rates of depression and anxiety [Neeleman 2018; Simon 2018]. Patients struggle with porphyria 
attacks, which cause severe, debilitating symptoms, extreme neuropathic pain, nausea, weakness to 
paralysis, confusion, hyponatremia and fatigue. Over time, these symptoms became chronic in most of the 
patients. Long term complications and comorbidities of AHP include chronic kidney disease, depression, 
anxiety, hypertension, irreversible neuropathy sometimes leading to quadriplegia, and liver disease.   
2.1.5.  Management 
Current treatment options are limited for all AHP subtypes. There are no approved treatments that directly 
ameliorate or prevent chronic symptoms experienced by many AHP patients and no approved treatments to 
reduce the risk of attacks [Bonkovsky 2014; Deybach 2006; Stein 2013; Tollanes 2012]. Management of 
acute AHP attacks often requires urgent medical attention in a healthcare setting. Patients are initially treated 
with supportive care such as intravenous (IV) glucose, typically large doses of IV opioid analgesics, and anti-
emetics along with the removal of known precipitating triggers, such as certain medications or fasting [Bissell 
2017; Bonkovsky 2013; Stein 2013]. Intravenous hemin, a human blood-derived heme formulation, is the 
only therapy currently approved for the treatment of acute attacks; hemin is not approved as a chronic 
Assessment report

treatment to prevent attacks [Bissell 2015]. While hemin infusion temporarily reduces production of ALA and 
PBG through feedback inhibition of ALAS1 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression, it has a short 
duration of action (elimination half-life of approximately 11 hours), which limits its effectiveness and 
contributes residual attack activity when used prophylactically. Hemin must be administered through a large 
peripheral or central venous catheter due to the risk of phlebitis. However, infection and thrombosis are 
common complications of indwelling IV catheter use. Frequent hemin administration can lead to increased 
risk of infections from indwelling venous catheters as well as hepatic iron build-up and subsequent injury due 
to iron overload. Despite these limitations, some patients are treated with regular, frequent prophylactic 
hemin infusions for lack of a suitable therapeutic alternative [Bissell 2015; Marsden 2015; Pischik 2015; Puy 
2010; Schmitt 2018]. 
Additional treatments for AHP include chemically induced menopause with hormonal suppression therapy 
(e.g., gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists) [Andersson 2003; Innala 2010], and liver transplantation 
for patients with refractory disease or those who no longer have adequate venous access [Soonawalla 2004; 
Stein 2013; Yasuda 2015]. However, the side effects of induction of menopause in a relatively young patient 
population make this treatment difficult to tolerate [Anderson 1990; Anderson 2005; Andersson 2003]. Liver 
transplant is a highly invasive treatment option not widely used due to limited availability of organs and risks 
associated with life-long immunosuppression.    
Consequently, there is an unmet need for therapies that durably decrease the frequency of debilitating 
attacks, diminish chronic symptoms, and improve patients’ physical functioning and quality of life.  
About the product 
Mode of action 
Givosiran is a ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) therapeutic that inhibits aminolevulinate synthase 1 
(ALAS1) mRNA in the liver. Givosiran is designed to be selectively delivered to the liver via uptake by the 
Asialoglycoprotein Receptor (ASGPR). ASGPRs are primarily and highly (0.5-1 million per cell) expressed on 
the cell surface of hepatocytes and specifically bind to the glycoproteins with terminal galactose or 
Triantennary N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues [Ashwell 1974; Baenziger 1980; Schwartz 1980]. 
Binding between the GalNAc ligand of givosiran and ASGPR triggers receptor-mediated endocytosis of the 
ligand-receptor complex, followed by release of the small interfering ribonucleic acid (siRNA) into the 
cytoplasm of the hepatocyte.  
Upon delivery to the liver, givosiran uses the naturally occurring RNAi pathway to specifically target and 
silence ALAS1 mRNA in the liver. This is accomplished by incorporation of givosiran siRNA into the cellular 
multiprotein enzyme cleavage complex known as the RNA-induced silencing complex, followed by separation 
of the 2 strands of the siRNA and binding of the antisense strand (the guide strand) to the complementary 
sequence in the ALAS1 mRNA. Pairing of ALAS1 mRNA with the antisense strand within the RNA-induced 
Silencing Complex (RISC)/siRNA complex results in specific and highly efficient cleavage of the ALAS1 mRNA. 
This prevents the synthesis of the corresponding ALAS1 protein [Bumcrot 2006; Elbashir 2001; Soutschek 
2004; Vaishnaw 2010].  
The RNAi-mediated lowering of induced liver ALAS1 mRNA levels and the consequent sustained decrease in 
the accumulation of toxic heme intermediates aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG) is 
expected to prevent or reduce the occurrence of serious neurovisceral attacks and ongoing symptoms in 
patients with AHP.

Proposed indication 
Givlaari is indicated for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) in adults and adolescents aged 12 
years and older.   
Recommended dose 
The recommended dose of Givlaari is 2.5 mg/kg once monthly, administered via subcutaneous (SC) injection. 
Dosing is based on actual body weight. A dose modification is proposed for patients with severe or clinically 
significant transaminase elevations, who have dose interruption and subsequent improvement, with dose 
resuming initially at 1.25 mg/kg once monthly with possible increase to the recommended 2.5 mg/kg dose if 
no recurrence of severe or clinically significant transaminase elevations occur. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was considered to 
be of major public health interest. This was based on the fact that the proposed treatment is a new strategy 
for the prevention of AHP attacks in an area of recognized high unmet need. Moreover, the results presented 
were suggestive of a substantial clinical benefit for the affected patients. Therefore, givosiran is considered of 
major public health interest and a major therapeutic innovation.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Givosiran is a new active substance, consisting of a double stranded synthetic chemically modified small 
interfering RNA (siRNA) and containing a combination of 2’ F and 2’ O-methyl nucleotides, conjugated to a 
triantennary N-acetyl galactosamine (GalNAc) ligand to facilitate delivery of the siRNA to the liver.  
The two single strands that form the double stranded RNA molecule are A-122230, the sense strand, and A-
122227, the antisense strand. The abbreviated chemical name for the sense strand is 5ʹ Cm-ps-Am-ps-Gm-
Am-Am-Am-Gf-Am-Gf-Um-Gf-Um-Cf-Um-Cf-Am-Um-Cm-Um-Um-Am-L96 3ʹ, which is base-paired with the 
antisense strand 5ʹ Um-ps-Af-ps-Af-Gf-Am-Uf-Gm-Af-Gm-Af-Cm-Af-Cm-Uf-Cm-Uf-Um-Uf-Cm-Uf-Gm-ps-Gm-
ps-Um- 3ʹ.

The molecular formula of the sodium salt is C524H694F16N173 Na43O316P43S6.  
The sodium salt has a relative molecular mass of 17,245.56 Da g/mol and the following structure (Figure 1). 
Figure 1: Givosiran structure 
The chemical structure and solid state properties of the sense and antisense strand and of the active 
substance givosiran was elucidated by a combination of analytical methods commonly used for the 
characterisation of synthetic oligonucleotide active substances; namely: sense- and antisense strand (LC-MS, 
MS-MS sequence confirmation sodium by AS, UV spectroscopy, 1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, 19F-NMR, 31P-NMR, and 
FTIR) and active substance (LC-MS, melting (denaturation) temperature (Tm), non-denaturing ion pair 
reversed phase HPLC with UV detection, UV, sodium by AS, 1H-NMR, imino-1H-NMR, 13C-NMR, 19F-NMR, 31P-
NMR, FTIR, circular dichroism, differential scanning calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis.  
Givosiran is a white to pale yellow, hygroscopic powder, freely soluble in water. Since the active substance is 
dissolved in the finished product, particle size distribution and polymorphic form are not relevant. 
All the pentose moieties of the nucleotides in the givosiran active substance are in the naturally occurring D-
ribose form. The chirality of the D-ribose is maintained during the synthesis of the modified nucleotides. 
Since the ribose moieties in an RNA sequence are predominantly in the C-3’end conformation, RNA molecules 
adopt the classic A-form, as demonstrated by the spectrum of Circular Dichroism. The phosphorothioate

group (PS) is chiral, with either Rp or Sp absolute configuration at the phosphorus. The antisense strand 
contains four PS modifications, with two on 5’end and two at 3’end, resulting in the formation of sixteen 
(24=16) diastereomers. The sense strand contains two PS modification at the 5’end, corresponding to four 
(22=4) diastereomers. The diastereomer species of the antisense strand and of the sense strand resolve 
chromatographically by the anion exchange HPLC method with UV detection. Consistency of the 
stereochemical purity variation has been demonstrated. The applicant has confirmed that the consistency of 
the distribution of stereoisomers will be evaluated as part of any future changes to the synthesis process. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Givosiran is manufactured by one manufacturer using a manufacturing process consisting of eight main steps 
using well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications.  
Assessment report

Scheme 1: Givosiran active substance manufacturing process 
 The manufacturing process involves the synthesis of the single-strand oligonucleotide by solid-phase 
synthesis (Step 1), cleavage and deprotection of the nucleobase protecting groups (Step 2). The two strands 
are manufactured by solid phase flow-through synthesis process in synthesis columns comprising repetitive 
cycles of four sub-steps, detritylation, coupling, thiolation/oxidation, and capping. When the targeted single 
strand oligonucleotide is assembled, the step continues with final de-block, and ends with diethylamine 
washing. 
Each strand is then individually purified and concentrated in Step 3 through Step 5; crude ultrafiltration (UF; 
Step 3), purification by anion exchange (Step 4); and a second UF (Step 5) for the sense and antisense 
strands. Step 1 to Step 5 are performed at a nominal scale of 250-mmol and 290-mmol for the sense and 
antisense strands, respectively. During Step 6, the two individual strands are annealed to form the duplex, 
which is concentrated at Step 7, then lyophilised and packaged in Step 8 to produce the givosiran active 
substance.  
The sense single strand intermediate is synthesised on polymeric support loaded with the GalNAc containing 
moiety and the synthesis of the antisense single strand is carried out on CpG support loaded with 4,4'-
dimethoxy trityl (DMT) protected 2'-OMe Uridine. Descriptions of relevant conditions, end of reaction 
determinations, and equipment (e.g. columns) have been given. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. Critical quality attributes 
(CQAs, namely: microbial limits, physical attributes, pH, identity, assay, purity, elemental impurities, product 
and process related impurities) have been defined and, based on them, the control strategy has been 
identified. The control strategy, as proposed by the applicant, consists in the control of material attributes, 
control of the critical process parameters (CPPs), in process controls, control of the sense and antisense 
strands, and release testing.  Normal operating ranges (NOR) and proven acceptable ranges (PAR) have been 
identified.  The NORs and PARs are linear and in line with the results of the manufacturing process 
development. A design space is not claimed. The applicant is recommended to evaluate the appropriateness 
of tightening the acceptance criteria for active substance in-process control limits once data from a total of 30 
batches become available. (REC 1) 
Characterisation of the product related impurities in the givosiran active substance was performed by two 
orthogonal analytical techniques, including a two-step fractionation using denaturing AX-HPLC in the first 
dimension, and ion pairing reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (IPRP 
HPLC-MS) in the second dimension, as well as by denaturing IPRP HPLC coupled with mass spectrometry. All 
impurity peaks with peak-area percent greater than 0.10% in AX-HPLC and IPRP-HPLC chromatograms were 
identified by structure, sequence, or by their mass. Clearance data clearly demonstrated that, following 
multiple washing and downstream purification steps, the levels of small molecule impurities, including 
residual solvents are reduced to levels below their respective limits of quantitation (LOQ), indicating 
consistent and efficient impurities removal during manufacturing steps. 
Evaluation of potential genotoxic impurities in the synthesis of givosiran active substance has been performed 
in accordance with the principles stipulated in the ICH M7 guideline. An evaluation of the risk on the presence 
of nitrosamine impurities has been provided and indicates that N-nitrosamine impurities cannot be present in 
either the givosiran active substance or finished product. 
The elemental impurities profiles throughout development and process validation demonstrate that the 
elemental impurities are adequately controlled and consistently low.

The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the clinical 
development program. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified. 
The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be 
comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
The active substance is packaged in a 2 L, gamma-irradiated, highdensity polyethylene bottle closed with a 
polypropylene screw-top closure, which comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification  
includes tests for appearance, identity by chromatographic retention time and MS (non-denaturing IPRP-HPLC 
UV and IPRP-HPLC ESI-MS), sequence (MS-MS) and Tm (UV); assay (UV); purity and impurities with 
orthogonal HPLC methods (non-denaturing and denaturating IPRP-HPLC UV and denaturating AX-HPLC UV); 
sodium content (flame AAS); pH (Ph.Eur.); water content (KF); elemental impurities (ICP-MS), residual 
solvents (Headspace GC and FID); bacterial endotoxin and bioburden (Ph. Eur.).The tested parameters are 
appropriate for this type of active substance. The release specification includes confirmation of the sequence 
of both intermediates, sense strand and antisense strand, as in-process control (IPC), instead of identification 
by sequencing; this has been adequately justified and it is considered acceptable. 
The convention of defining the impurities in the specification as groups rather than individual components has 
been satisfactorily justified.  
It is acknowledged that oligonucleotides are excluded from the scope of the ICH guidance on impurities in 
active substances (Q3A (R2)). The applied thresholds are in line with the thresholds for synthetic peptides 
described in the Ph. Eur. Monograph ‘Substance for pharmaceutical use’ and is considered acceptable for 
givosiran as synthetic peptides are made by comparable processes (stepwise sequence growth on solid phase 
with protection and deprotection reagents and solvents), with the same limitations of impurity removal during 
the stepwise synthesis and similarly complex impurity profiles due to the iterative nature of the process with 
possible formation of many different product-related impurities. Additionally, the analytical methods applied 
to characterise and control product-related impurities of synthetic peptides and oligonucleotides are 
comparable. Therefore, the proposed limits for unidentified impurity peaks and unqualified impurity peaks are 
acceptable. In view of the results of the six clinical batches, limits for specified impurities by denaturing AX-
HPLC UV and by denaturing IPRP-HPLC UV, as well as for other parameters could be tightened. The applicant 
is recommended to re-evaluate and tighten, when appropriate, the proposed acceptance criteria for specified 
impurities by denaturing AX-HPLC UV and by denaturing IPRP-HPLC UV, as well as for other parameters 
identified by the applicant, when 30 batches of the active substance have been manufactured.  (REC 2) 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay, purity and identity were provided.  
Batch analysis data on several batches of the active substance used for non-clinical, clinical, stability and 
process performance qualification are provided.  Four of the eight batches were manufactured at commercial 
scale. The results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch.

Stability 
Stability data from six batches of active substance, four of which have been manufactured at commercial 
scale from the proposed manufacturer, stored in the intended commercial package for up to 48 months under 
long term conditions (-20°C) and for up to six months under accelerated conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), 
according to the ICH guidelines, were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: appearance, purity (non-denaturating and denaturating IPRP-HPLC, 
denaturating AX-HPLC), assay and water content.  
All tested parameters were within the specification limits at long term and accelerated storage conditions, 
confirming that the total of impurities of givosiran active substance will remain within the registration 
specification limit (NMT 20.0 area %) during short-term storage at room temperature condition (~25°C) 
during the manufacture of the finished product. 
Photostability testing, following the ICH guideline Q1B, was performed on two batches and demonstrated that 
givosiran active substance is not sensitive to light. Results on stress conditions (thermal, acidic, basic, 
oxidative, and photolytic stress) were also provided on one batch and confirmed that the chromatographic 
methods are stability indicating. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 30 months when stored at -20°C in the 
proposed container.

Table 1: composition of finished product 
Givosiran finished product is a solution of givosiran active substance dissolved in water for injection. The pH of 
the solution is adjusted to 6.5 to 7.5 with sodium hydroxide or phosphoric acid, as needed. Givosiran finished 
product is sterile and preservative-free and it is intended for single use. Bacterial endotoxins are controlled to 
a suitable limit.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. 
There  are  no  novel  excipients  used  in  the  finished  product  formulation.  The  list  of  excipients  is  included  in 
section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The formulation is simple and straightforward. Since the active substance is dissolved, particle size distribution 
and polymorphic form are not critical. The concentration (required dose volume), viscosity, pH and osmolality 
of the finished product are suitable for subcutaneous administration. In order to deliver 1.0 mL of extractable 
volume of finished product, the target fill volume for filling operation is set to 1.15 mL which represents a 0.15 
mL overfill.  
The manufacturing process development and control strategy followed a risk-based approach. The information 
provided in the pharmaceutical development is satisfactory. A summary of the givosiran finished product and 
quality attributes (QAs) along with their justification for criticality assignment is provided in Table 2.

the  melting  temperature  of  siRNA  duplex  which  would  result  in  denaturation  of  the  active  substance;  γ-
Irradiation  has  been  shown  to  cause  oxidative  degradation  in  nucleotides.  Suitability  of  the  filters  and  hold 
times has been demonstrated. 
The  formulation  used  during  clinical  studies  is  the  same  as  that  intended  for  marketing  and  has  been 
manufactured using the proposed commercial manufacturing method. 
The primary packaging is a glass vial with a PTFE-coated chlorobutyl rubber stopper and a flip-off aluminium 
seal. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has 
been  validated  by  stability  and  extractable  and  leachable  data  and  is  adequate  for  the  intended  use  of  the 
product.  
A syringe for SC administration is not provided with the product. Taking into consideration the lowest dose for 
a 12 years old child and the dose for a patient with bodyweight over 80 kg, it can be concluded that the finished 
product meets the requirements of the QWP Q&A on graduation of measuring devices for liquid dosage forms 
and  hence  it  can  be  administered  with  syringes  commonly  available  in  hospitals.  Compatibility  with 
polycarbonate  and  polypropylene,  the  materials  commonly  used  for  the  manufacture  of  syringes  for 
subcutaneous use, has been demonstrated. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of three main steps: compounding (active substance dissolution, pH and 
concentration adjustment), sterile filtration (using two 0.2 μm filters connected in series) into a single-use bag 
(stored at 2°C-8°C for up to 72 hours) and aseptic filling (total fill duration is not more than 12 hours). Sterile 
filtration is completed within 120 minutes. Glass vials are washed, rinsed and depyrogenated via dry heat. The 
stoppers  are  steam  sterilized  prior  to  use.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  non-standard  manufacturing 
process. 
Aseptic  filtration  as  method  for  sterilisation  has  been  adequately  justified.  Suitability  of  the  filters  has  been 
demonstrated.  The  filters  have  adequately  been  validated  and  evaluated  for  extractables  and  chemical 
compatibility (product exposure). 
Results of process validation have been provided of three consecutive batches manufactured at the proposed 
site  and  using  the  commercial  scale  process.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the  manufacturing  process  is 
capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls 
are adequate for this type of manufacturing process. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  shown  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form: 
appearance, identification by chromatographic retention and MS (non-denaturing IPRP-HPLC UV and IPRP-HPLC 
ESI-MS), assay (UV), purity and impurities with orthogonal HPLC methods (non-denaturing and denaturating 
IPRP-HPLC UV and denaturating AX-HPLC UV), pH, osmolality, particulate matter, bacterial endotoxins, sterility, 
extractable volume (all Ph.Eur.) and container closure integrity (dye ingress). 
Givosiran  finished  product  uses  the  same  impurity  evaluation  strategy  and  chromatographic  separation 
parameters used for givosiran active substance and its constituent single strands. The analysis confirms that 
givosiran active substance remains predominantly in its native duplex form in the finished product. The result 
is expressed as percentage of the main duplex peak based on the total area of the chromatogram. Some of the

proposed limits for impurities are slightly wider than the corresponding active substance specification limits. 
However, this can be acceptable as these limits are qualified by the non-clinical studies (see non-clinical report). 
The  proposed  limits  for  assay  (by  UV),  purity,  total  impurities  and  specified  (groups  of)  impurities  (by 
denaturing  IPRP-HPLC  UV  and  denaturing  AX-HPLC  UV)  are  wide  and  could  be  tightened.  The  applicant  is 
recommended to re-evaluate and tighten, when appropriate, the proposed acceptance criteria for assay (by 
UV), purity, total impurities and specified (groups of) impurities (by denaturing IPRP-HPLC UV and denaturing 
AX-HPLC UV) when 30 batches of finished product have been manufactured.  (REC 3) 
The proposed limits for unidentified impurity peaks (NMT 0.5%) and unqualified impurity peaks (NMT 1.0%) 
are acceptable as discussed in the active substance section.  
The proposed limit for Bacterial Endotoxins (100 EU/ml) is acceptable. Dosing 2.5 mg/kg bodyweight which 
corresponds with 0.0125 mL/kg bodyweight, allows a limit of 5 EU/kg / 0.0125 mL/kg = 400 EU/mL. 
The other proposed specification acceptance criteria are acceptable. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk assessment it can 
be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in the finished product 
specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory. 
Since the solution is slightly coloured, the applicant has been recommended to add a specific quality control 
‘Degree of coloration’ (Ph Eur 2.2.2) in the finished product specification by Q2, 2020. (REC 4) 
The chromatographic methods are in line with the methods applied for the control of the active substance. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines.  
The same reference standards used in the active substance testing are also used in the finished product. 
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on eight batches of the finished product used for non-clinical, clinical, stability and 
process performance qualification are provided.  Some batches were manufactured at commercial scale. The 
results confirm the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended 
product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 6 batches of finished product, some at full commercial scale, stored for up to 48 months 
under long term conditions (2-8 ºC) and  (25 ºC/60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions 
(40  ºC/75%  RH)  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  Samples  were  stored  in  the  up-right  and 
inverted position to increase the contact time with the elastomer stopper. The registration stability batches of 
medicinal  product  are  identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging 
proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for the parameters listed in the release specifications, with the exception of identity; its 
omission is acceptable as it is not affected by storage. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
All results were within specification for the samples stored under long-term conditions. No significant changes 
have been observed under the named conditions.

In addition, two batches were exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New 
Drug Substances and Products. Only minor changes in impurity levels (<5%) were observed which are of no 
concern in reference to the transient exposure to light during administration of the product. The finished product 
is susceptible to oxidative stress but not to thermal stress. The analytical methods are stability indicating. 
Based on the available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months at the storage conditions “Do not 
store above 25C. Keep vial in the outer carton to protect from light.” as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is 
acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The manufacturing process of the finished product is straightforward. The 
results of the tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. In view of the few batches available at the time of this application, the 
applicant has been recommended to tightened the IPC and release specification limits of the active substance 
and finished product when more data is available; the addition of a test for degree of coloration in the 
finished product specification has also been recommended, see below list of recommendations for future 
quality development.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no impact 
on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  The applicant is recommended to evaluate the appropriateness of tightening the acceptance criteria 
for active substance in-process control limits once data from a total of 30 batches of the active 
substance become available. 
2.  The applicant is recommended to re-evaluate and tighten, when appropriate, the proposed 
acceptance criteria for specified impurities by denaturing AX-HPLC UV and by denaturing IPRP-HPLC 
UV, as well as for other parameters identified by the applicant, when 30 batches of the active 
substance have been manufactured.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/70703/2020 
Page 24/101 
  
  
3.  The applicant is recommended to re-evaluate and tighten, when appropriate, the proposed 
acceptance criteria for assay (by UV), purity, total impurities and specified (groups of) impurities (by 
denaturing IPRP-HPLC UV and denaturing AX-HPLC UV) when 30 batches of finished product have 
been manufactured.  
4.  Since the solution is slightly coloured, the applicant has been recommended to add a specific quality 
control ‘Degree of coloration’ (Ph Eur 2.2.2) in the finished product specification by Q2, 2020. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The pharmacology, safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and toxicology of givosiran were evaluated in a 
series of in vitro and in vivo nonclinical studies. According to the Applicant, all pivotal studies were carried 
out in accordance with good laboratory practice (GLP). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro studies 
Identification of Givosiran: A Potent and Specific siRNA Targeting ALAS1 (Study BIO14037) 
A series of 36 siRNAs were identified and synthesized, containing antisense strands with perfect 
complementarity to monkey and human ALAS1 mRNAs, and in some cases, perfect complementarity or 1 to 2 
mismatches to mouse and/or rat ALAS1 mRNAs. In vitro activity of these chemically modified siRNAs with 
triantennary GalNAc ligands conjugated to the 3' end of the sense strand was evaluated by transient 
transfection in human liver carcinoma cell line-3B (Hep3B) liver cells.  
From the most potent siRNAs identified, one was selected for additional lead optimization and modifications. 
This parent duplex, with complete sequence homology to human and monkey ALAS1, and is therefore 
expected to be pharmacologically active in each of the indicated species. From a series of chemical analogues 
of this compound that were analysed, based on a minimum reduction of ALAS1 mRNA in Hep3B cells of 
approximately 80% and 60% at 10 and 0.1 nM, respectively, ALN-60519 (givosiran) was selected as the lead 
development candidate based on an IC50 value of approximately 26 pM.  
Polymorphism analysis (Study BIO14024) 
Given the sequence specific nature of RNAi, a single mismatch between the antisense strand of the ALAS1 
targeting siRNA and its target mRNA sequence can lead to a reduction or loss of activity. Naturally occurring 
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the siRNA target site could impact activity, an effect that could be 
exacerbated if the SNP was enriched in individuals from a specific geographic/ethnic background. A search of 
the NCBI dbSNP database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/), build 141 of May 21, 2014, was performed to 
identify any potential SNPs that might occur in the givosiran binding site. Results demonstrated 100% 
sequence conservation for the givosiran target site in all humans whose ALAS1 gene has been sequenced to

date (source: NCBI dbSNP as of 16 June 2014). There are no SNPs, or any other type of polymorphism found 
in the givosiran target region of ALAS1 mRNA.   
Activity of metabolites (Study BIO18001) 
An evaluation of this AS(N-1)3' truncation metabolite by transfection in Hep3B cells demonstrated retention 
of pharmacological activity in vitro. The inhibition potential was similar for givosiran and the metabolite when 
tested at 10 nM, but was reduced for the metabolite when tested at the lower concentration of 0.1 nM (52% 
mRNA remaining after treatment for the metabolite, versus 16% remaining for givosiran).  
In vivo studies 
Studies in rat and mouse disease models 
A mouse model of Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) exists that is a compound heterozygote for 
porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD) mutations and manifests similar biochemical features of human AIP such 
as decreased PBGD activity in the liver. Treatment of these mice with the cytochrome P450 (CYP)-inducing 
drug phenobarbital (PB), resulted in 3- to 5-fold induction of ALAS1 mRNA and 50- to 200-fold induction of 
ALA and PBG, mimicking the increases in ALA and PBG plasma levels that occur coincidently with acute 
attacks in AIP patients. 
The potential for givosiran to lower ALA and PBG intermediates was evaluated in a prophylaxis setting (Study 
BIO14012), in which mice were administered 4 weekly doses of givosiran between 0.3-3 mg/kg near prior to 
PB administration (Figure 2).  
Figure 2.Serum ALA and PBG Levels After Multiple Subcutaneous Doses of Givosiran in a Mouse 
AIP Model. Bars represent the mean of 3 animals; error bars depict SD.  
Using an acute treatment regimen (Study BIO14050), AIP mice were given daily intraperitoneal (IP) 
injections of PB and a second CYP) inducer, diethyldithiocarbamate (DDC), to achieve more sustained ALA 
and PBG increases. These animals were then treated with hemin (Panhematin, the current standard of care 
for patients with AIP) or givosiran (Figure 3).

Figure 3. Givosiran Decreases Serum ALA and PBG Faster Than Heme in a Mouse AIP Model. Bars 
represent the mean of 2-5 animals; error bars depict standard deviation (SD). 
A rat AIP model was developed in which PBGD mRNA is reduced by approximately 80% in rat liver, by IV 
dosing a PBGD-specific siRNA in a lipid nanoparticle. In an acute treatment study (Study BIO14010), a single 
givosiran dose of 5 or 10 mg/kg SC administered on Day 2 of the PB induction phase prevented the induction 
of the ALAS1 mRNA in rat liver. Furthermore, the givosiran 10 mg/kg SC dose nearly completely blocked any 
stimulation of ALA and PBG production (Figure 4).

Treatment With Givosiran in a Rat AIP Model. Bars represent the mean of 3 animals; error bars 
depicts standard deviation (SD). 
In a multiple dose study in the rat AIP model (Study BIO14011), 4 doses of ALN-AS1 at 3 mg/kg once weekly 
(QW) prevented any PB induced increase in liver ALAS1 mRNA (Figure 5). In addition, the 4 weekly doses of 
3 mg/kg givosiran prevented any overproduction of urinary ALA and PBG. In both studies in the rat model, 
the level of ALAS1 mRNA in liver tightly correlated with urinary ALA and PBG levels.

Studies in wild-type rats 
WT rats (Sprague Dawley) were administered increasing doses of givosiran via SC injection. Dose-dependent 
lowering of liver ALAS1 mRNA was observed following single-dose administration of givosiran in Sprague 
Dawley rats with approximately 50% reduction observed at 10 mg/kg givosiran. At the 2.5 mg/kg dose, liver 
ALAS1 levels were still reduced by greater than 30%. 
Repeat dosing in rats also resulted in dose-dependent ALAS1 target mRNA lowering (Study BIO14009). A 
repeat-dose regimen of once weekly SC doses for 4 weeks resulted in more significant target reduction than 
occurred with a single dose. Whereas a single, 5-mg/kg dose resulted in approximately 40% reduction of 
ALAS1 mRNA, 4 weekly 5 mg/kg doses resulted in greater than 60% reduction   
An additional study in rats with 8 weekly 2.5 mg/kg doses or a loading dose of 5 mg/kg followed by 7 weekly 
1 mg/kg doses resulted in a maximum of 75% and 70% ALAS1 mRNA silencing, respectively (Study 
BIO18002). 
Studies in monkeys 
ALAS1 is not a secreted serum protein, thus limiting the ability to monitor kinetics of drug activity and liver 
ALAS1 mRNA recovery in the absence of serial liver biopsies. As such, a circulating extracellular RNA 
detection (cERD) assay was developed in preclinical species as a less invasive approach to monitor ALAS1 
mRNA levels in which exosomal RNA is isolated from serum and urine. The results exhibited statistically 
significant correlations and good consistency between serum and urine cERD ALAS1 mRNA levels and intra-
hepatic levels, at the same time points (4h) post-givosiran dosing (data not shown). Therefore, the cERD 
method was used to assess the impact of givosiran on ALAS1 mRNA reduction in the repeat-dose studies in 
monkeys.  
In monkeys, a single SC administration of givosiran at 1 or 10 mg/kg resulted in detectable reduction of 
serum ALAS1 mRNA levels monitored with the cERD assay.  Several different repeat-dose regimens were 
explored in monkeys. These included an 8-week study w to further assess ALAS1 lowering with different 
dosing regimens (Study BIO14027, Figure 6).

Monkeys. Each graphical data point represents the remaining ALAS1 mRNA for the group average 
of 3 animal samples ± standard deviation (SD). 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
An in silico search (BIO14038) was performed to identify any potential off-target sequences in the human 
genome, to which givosiran might bind resulting in reduced expression of that target. There are no sites in 
the genome with identical sequences to givosiran antisense strand or with only one mismatch. The closest 
matches contained at least two mismatches. Those target sequences with the highest potential for binding to 
givosiran were further assessed in an in vitro assay in HepG2 cells. None of the investigated target sequences 
showed any reduction of mRNA levels when the cells were treated with up to 10 nM givosiran, compared to 
the IC50 value of 88 pM for ALAS1 in this study.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
Cardiovascular and respiratory systems 
A cardiovascular and respiratory safety pharmacology study (Study AS1-NCD14-019) was conducted in 
conscious monkeys using telemetry. Using a cross-over study design, animals (n=5 males) were 
administered vehicle control (0.9% sterile saline) and givosiran at 150 mg/kg via single SC injection at a 
dose volume of 0.75 mL/kg. There were no mortalities or clinical observations during the course of the study. 
Therefore, the no observed effect level (NOEL) for cardiovascular and respiratory functional effects was 
≥150 mg/kg givosiran. 
Central nervous system 
Neurological assessments were conducted as part of the 13-week (Study AS1-NCD14-011) and 39-week 
(Study AS1-GLP15-018) repeat-dose GLP toxicity study in monkeys. The NOEL for neurological functional 
effects was ≥150 mg/kg givosiran as no neurological findings with weekly administration of givosiran up to 
that dose were observed.

Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies have been performed.  
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies were performed in mice (distribution), rats (absorption, distribution, 
metabolism and excretion) and monkeys (absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion). In all studies, 
givosiran was administered subcutaneously, which is the intended clinical route. 
Absorption  
The plasma PK profiles of givosiran were evaluated after administration of a single IV dose or single and 
multiple SC doses in rats and monkeys. There were no apparent sex differences in the PK parameters in both 
species, therefore, the PK parameters presented are based on overall mean values generated by combining 
sexes, unless otherwise noted. 
Studies in rats 
The plasma PK of givosiran were evaluated after a single IV dose or single SC administration in rats. The 
results are shown in Table 3.

Exposure to givosiran and metabolite AS(N-1)3’ after a single dose 
A separate PK study in rats was conducted to determine the relative plasma exposure and PK profile of the 
major metabolite, AS(N-1)3’-givosiran after a single SC dose of givosiran at 10 mg/kg (study 
AS1-DSM18-010). 
Cmax of givosiran and AS(N-1)3’-givosiran in plasma were 1.06 and 0.190 μg/mL, respectively. Plasma AUClast 
of givosiran and AS(N-1)3’-givosiran were 3.00 and 0.626 h*μg/mL, respectively. Plasma exposure of AS(N-
1)3’-givosiran as assessed by AUClast was approximately 21% of exposure of givosiran. After reaching Cmax,
givosiran and AS(N-1)3’-givosiran concentrations declined with the t½ value of 3.0 and 8.2 hours,
respectively.
Studies in monkeys 
Single dose 
The plasma PK of givosiran was evaluated after a single IV dose (10 mg/kg) or single SC administration (0.1, 
1, 5 or 10 mg/kg) in cynomolgus monkeys (study AS1-NCD14-007) using a LC/MS method. 
Givosiran plasma concentrations declined in a multiphasic manner. The mean CL and Vss values were 
340 mL/h/kg and 104 mL/kg, respectively, suggesting distribution of givosiran beyond the vasculature. After 
a single SC administration, givosiran was not detectable at the 0.1 mg/kg dose.  
Multiple doses 
The PK profiles of givosiran were evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys after multiple SC doses with various 
dosing regimens and analysed using a LC/MS method (Table 5).

Exposure to givosiran and metabolite AS(N-1)3’ after a single dose 
A separate PK study in cynomolgus monkeys was conducted to determine the relative plasma exposure and 
the PK of the major metabolite, AS(N-1)3’-givosiran after a single SC dose of givosiran at 30 mg/kg (study 
AS1-DSM18-009).  
The Cmax of givosiran and AS(N-1)3’-givosiran in plasma were 2.42 and 1.56 μg/mL, respectively. Plasma 
AUClast of givosiran and AS(N-1)3’-givosiran were 26.4 and 19.4 h*μg/mL, respectively. Plasma exposure of 
AS(N-1)3’-givosiran as assessed by AUClast was approximately 74% of exposure of givosiran. After reaching 
Cmax, givosiran and AS(N-1)3’-givosiran concentrations declined with the t½ values of 5.5 and 5.1 hours, 
respectively. Givosiran and AS(N-1)3’-givosiran were measurable in plasma up to 24 h after administration.

Distribution in mice 
Distribution in liver and kidneys in toxicokinetic studies 
Tissue distribution of givosiran in transgenic Tg-rasH2 hemizygous BALB/cBy × C57BL/6 F1 mice was 
evaluated in an investigational toxicology study. Mice were administered once weekly SC injections of 
givosiran for 8 weeks and samples of liver and kidney were analysed for givosiran using a LC-MS/HRAM 
method (Table 7).

method in wild-type Tg-rasH2 mice after SC administration of 3 monthly givosiran and AS(N-1)3’-givosiran. 
Liver exposure of givosiran and AS(N-1)3’-givosiran increased with the increase in dose level from 500 to 
1500 mg/kg, but the increases were less than dose proportional. The concentration of AS(N-1)3’-givosiran in 
the liver was approximately 30% of givosiran  
Distribution of givosiran following 5 once weekly SC doses administration in male, CD-1 mice were evaluated 
in the liver and kidney after the last dose. Givosiran concentrations in tissues were determined using a HPLC 
Atto-probe method with fluorescence detection. Liver concentrations of givosiran were measurable for up to 
336 to 672 hours (last sampling point) following the fifth weekly SC dose. The mean liver TK parameters are

Distribution in rats 
Distribution of givosiran to the liver and kidney in rats was evaluated after a single SC dose of 10 mg/kg up 
to 1344 hours post-dose (study AS1-NCD14-003). Distribution of givosiran to the liver and kidney was also 
compared after administration of a single IV or SC dose of 10 mg/kg up to 1344 hours post-dose (Table 9). 
Givosiran concentrations in tissues were determined using a HPLC Atto-probe method with fluorescence 
detection. There were no apparent sex-related differences in the distribution of givosiran.

Markedly lower concentrations of givosiran (100- to 800-fold <liver; 10- to 70-fold <kidney) were observed 
in adrenal, heart, lung, spleen, thyroid, thymus, pancreas, jejunum, and testes (data not shown). In most 
tissues, givosiran was measurable up to 24 h after administration. Givosiran was not detected in the brain. 
Liver and kidney concentrations of givosiran were also assessed in rats after administration of 3 different SC 
multiple dosing regimens (8 weekly doses at 1 or 2.5 mg/kg; or after a 5 mg/kg loading dose followed by 
7 weekly doses of 1 mg/kg, at time points that included 168 hours following each of the first 7 weekly doses, 
and up to 672 hours following the eighth dose (study AS1-NCD14-003). 
After repeat SC dosing, Cmax and AUClast of givosiran in the liver and kidney increased approximately dose 
proportionally from 1 to 2.5 mg/kg, and values were similar after eight 1- or 5/1-mg/kg doses. Compared to 
the dose normalized Cmax (20.8 and 1.90 μg/g in liver and kidney, respectively at 1 mg/kg) and AUC (1259 
and 319 h*μg/g in liver and kidney, respectively at 1 mg/kg) after a single SC dose (10 mg/kg) in rats, there 
was no evidence of accumulation in the liver after repeated weekly SC doses (1 mg/kg) of givosiran. 
However, givosiran exposure in the kidney was 3- to 4-times higher, indicating that givosiran accumulated in 
the kidney after repeated weekly SC doses.  
Distribution in rats by quantitative whole-body autoradiography 
A tissue distribution study using quantitative whole-body autoradiography (QWBA) (study AS1-DSM17-018) 
was conducted in rats with [3H]-givosiran (10 mg/kg SC) radiolabeled with adenosine. Blood to plasma 
concentrations ratios of total radioactivity after SC dosing to rats were generally less than one, indicating that 
the distribution of givosiran to red blood cells was minimal. 
The tissues showing the highest maximum concentrations of radioactivity included liver, lymph nodes, urinary 
bladder, thoracic duct, and kidneys, with values of 162, 38.2, 28.4, 17.7, and 15.2 µg equivalents [3H]-

givosiran/g, respectively. The tissues with the lowest Cmax values were prostate gland, large intestine, and 
spleen, with concentrations of 0.691, 0.782, and 0.877 µg equivalents [3H]-givosiran/g, respectively. 
Radioactivity was cleared from all tissues by 672 hours post-dose, with the exception of liver, kidneys, and 
dose site. At 1344 hours post-dose, radioactivity was still quantifiable in the dose site.  
Distribution in liver and kidneys in toxicokinetic studies 
As part of several of the toxicology studies, toxicokinetic analyses were performed in liver and kidneys of 
rats. The results are shown in Table 10 (liver) and Table 11 (kidney). Treatment was SC in all studies.

Distribution in pregnant rats 
In study AS1-DSM15-041, female rats were administered SC dose of givosiran 4 times (once weekly) on 
22 days, 15 days, 8 days and 1 day before cohabitation at 10, 30 or 100 mg/kg (study AS1-DSM15-041). 
Mean (±SD) givosiran maternal liver concentrations are summarized in Table 12. Givosiran concentrations 
were not measurable in any fetus from any dose group.

In the pivotal EFD study (study AS1-GLP16-011), the same dosing regimen was used. Mean givosiran 
maternal liver concentrations increased in a greater than dose proportional exposure (approximate 6-fold 
increase with a 3-fold increase in dose) for the low to middle dose groups, and in a dose proportional manner 
between the mid and high dose groups. Givosiran placentae concentrations were measurable only in the 
animals in the highest dose group (30 mg/kg/wk; 5 mg/kg/day), and 50% of placentae showed measurable 
levels. Mean placentae concentration of givosiran (0.388 µg/g) was significantly lower (~890-fold) than 
corresponding maternal liver concentration (347 µg/g). Givosiran concentrations were not measurable in any 
fetus from any dose groups. 
Distribution in pregnant rabbits 
In study AS1-DSM16-012, female rabbits were administered once daily SC injections of givosiran on DG 7 
through DG 19 at doses ranging from 3 to 30 mg/kg. Givosiran maternal liver concentration increased 
greater than dose proportionally over the dose range of 3 to 30 mg/kg/day. Givosiran placentae 
concentrations were not measurable in the two lowest dose groups (3 mg/kg/day, 10 mg/kg/day). In the 
30 mg/kg/day givosiran dose group, only 30% of all placentae had measurable concentrations, and the mean 
concentration was 442 ng/g. Concentrations in fetuses were not measured in this study. 
In the definitive rabbit EFD study (study AS1-GLP16-018), pregnant rabbits were administered once daily SC 
injections from DG 7 through DG 19 at doses ranging from 0.5 to 5 mg/kg. One group received a single 
20 mg/kg SC dose of givosiran on DG 7. Givosiran maternal liver concentrations increased greater than dose 
proportionally over the dose range of 0.5 to 5 mg/kg/day. No measurable concentrations of givosiran were 
found in any of the placentae or fetal samples, indicating that givosiran is not transferred to the fetus at the 
dose range evaluated in the study. 
Distribution in monkeys 
Pharmacokinetics in liver 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/70703/2020 
Page 36/101 
Distribution of givosiran in male and female cynomolgus monkey liver was determined after a single IV or SC 
doses up to 2016 hours post-dose and analysed using a HPLC Atto-probe method with fluorescence detection. 
The AUClast in the liver was approximately 7-fold higher after a single SC dose of 10 mg/kg than after the 
same dose administered IV indicating that liver uptake is more efficient after SC administration compared 
with IV administration. The liver to plasma AUC ratio was approximately 2500, and the t1/2 in the liver was 
significantly longer (~146 hours) than that in plasma. 
Mean Cmax and AUClast values increased approximately dose proportionally across single and multiple SC 
doses. Relative to a single 1-mg/kg SC dose, there was no apparent significant increase in liver exposure 
after multiple once weekly dosing (8 doses) at 1 mg/kg or after a loading dose of 5 mg/kg followed by 
7 weekly doses of 1 mg/kg suggesting minimal accumulation in liver with repeat dosing. The t½ was 
consistent across doses and regimens, indicating no dose- or time-dependent PK. After multiple doses, 
givosiran was measurable up to 1344 h after the last dose.  
Metabolism 
In vitro metabolism 
The in vitro metabolic stability of givosiran was evaluated in pooled serum and liver S9 fractions obtained 
from C57BL/6 mouse, rat, monkey, and human, at a concentration of 5 μM (study BA14010).  
Following 24 hours of incubation of givosiran (5 μM) in mouse, rat, monkey, or human serum, the percentage 
of antisense strand remaining was approximately 75%, 59%, 63%, and 89%, respectively; the percentage of 
sense strand remaining was approximately 95%, 95%, 100%, and 95%, respectively.  
When mouse, rat, monkey, or human liver S9 fraction was incubated with givosiran (5 μM), there was a 
range of stability profiles for the 4 species with the rank order from most to least stable being 
mouse>monkey>human>rat, for both strands. 
A separate in vitro study (study AS1-DSM18-015) was conducted in human liver S9 fraction with and without 
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NADPH) to determine if givosiran was metabolized 
by drug metabolizing enzymes requiring NADPH as a cofactor (eg, cytochrome P450, CYPs). Both sense and 
antisense strands of givosiran were stable, and no change was observed with and without NADPH.  
Metabolite profiling 
Metabolism of antisense strand 
Monkey plasma, liver and urine samples from study AS1-NCD14-007 and in selected human plasma and 
urine samples confirmed that that the major metabolite was AS(N-1)3’-givosiran (study BA17014). In 
monkey urine, AS(N-1)3’-givosiran was the major metabolite, with concentrations higher than givosiran at all 
time points (study BA17014).  
AS(N-1)3’-givosiran was the major circulating pharmacologically active metabolite after SC administration of 
givosiran in humans. Relative to givosiran, the steady-state AUC exposure of AS(N-1)3’-givosiran is 
approximately 46% after administration of 2.5 mg/kg every month (refer to ALN-AS1-001). The systemic 
exposure of AS(N-1)3’-givosiran after SC administration of givosiran was 21% and 73% relative to givosiran 
Assessment report

Page 37/101 
exposure in rats (10 mg/kg, study AS1-DSM18-010,) and monkeys (30 mg/kg, study AS1-DSM18-009,) 
respectively.  
An evaluation of this AS(N-1)3'-givosiran metabolite by transfection in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell 
line 3B (Hep3B) cells demonstrated retention of pharmacological activity in vitro (study BIO18001, see 
section 2.1). 
Metabolism of sense strand 
Either in serum (mouse, rat, monkey, and human) or plasma (rat and monkey), the givosiran sense strand 
was minimally metabolized primarily generating a metabolite corresponding to the loss of one GalNAc group 
from the triantennary ligand at the 3' end (study BA14010). Similar to the finding in rat and monkey plasma, 
givosiran sense strand with the loss of 1 or 3 GalNAc groups were also detected in plasma and urine from two 
human patients. 
Metabolic profiling of in vitro liver S9 fractions (mouse, rat, monkey, and human) and in vivo rat and monkey 
liver samples showed that the major putative metabolites of the givosiran sense strand were generated by 
the loss of 1, 2, or all 3 GalNAc moieties at the 3' end. Loss of GalNAc was evident at the earliest time point 
of 2 hours. Remaining full length by 24 h in vitro was 66% in rat, 19% in monkey and 56% in human liver S9 
fractions. In vivo, decline of full-length sense strand in the liver was early, with 10% at 2 h and no full length 
at 8 h in rats, and 1% full length at 8 h in monkeys.  
In vivo metabolism in intact and bile-duct cannulated rats 
The in vivo metabolic profile of givosiran was determined after a single SC administration (10 mg/kg) of [3H]-
givosiran in both intact and bile-duct cannulated (BDC) rats (study AS1-DSM17-018).  
The profile of an AUC-pooled plasma sample (plasma samples between 0.5 and 48 h) showed that the 
majority of the radioactivity was associated with unchanged givosiran and accounted for approximately 54% 
of the total radioactivity exposure through 48 hours (AUC0-48). AS(N-1)3’-givosiran was a major circulating 
metabolite contributing 13.0% of the total radioactivity exposure from 0.5 to 48 h. At 48 h, givosiran and 
AS(N-1)3’-givosiran were not detectable. Other peaks (comprising up to 14% of total radioactivity) were 
shown to be dose formulation impurities (these peaks were also present in dose formulation samples).  
The majority of the radioactivity in urine was eluted as an unknown peak of radioactivity, indicated as M1. 
Attempts were made to identify the M1 using different methodologies such as SPE clean up and different 
HPLC columns, but were not successful. M1 is thought to consist of a mixture of degraded drug-related 
components, which are considered likely polar and smaller oligonucleotides. M1 accounted for 38.7% and 
18.8% of the dose in intact and BDC rats, respectively.  
Unchanged givosiran was recovered in urine from both intact and BDC rats, accounted for 3.38% and 3.90% 
of the dose, respectively. AS(N-1)3’-givosiran accounted for 0.971% and 1.96% of the dose in urine from 
intact and BDC rats, respectively. In bile, approximately 6% and 5% of the dose was recovered as 
unchanged givosiran and AS(N-1)3’-givosiran, respectively. No unchanged givosiran was recovered in feces. 
Excretion 
A mass balance study was conducted in rats after administration of a single SC dose givosiran to male intact 
and BDC/jugular vein-cannulated (JVC) rats (study AS1-DSM17-018). Givosiran was also quantitated in

Excretion in milk of rats 
Excretion of givosiran in the milk from female rats was evaluated in the developmental and 
perinatal/postnatal reproduction study (study AS1-GLP17-009). Givosiran was administered for a total of 6 
doses between 3 and 30 mg/kg. Givosiran concentration in the milk was not measurable in 3 and 10 mg/kg 
groups. Only one dam out of 4 in 30 mg/kg group had a measurable concentration of 229 ng/mL (LLOQ: 
200 ng/mL) in the milk. Concentration in plasma in the 30 mg/kg group on LD 12, at 2 h post-dose was 
2010-3650 ng/mL.  
Excretion in rabbit seminal fluid 
Givosiran concentrations in seminal fluid were evaluated in male rabbits after a single SC administration of 
2.5 or 20 mg/kg (study INV-DSM16-057). Givosiran was detectable at all time points (8-216 hours post-
dose) in both dose groups with the Cmax occurring at 8 hours post-dose. The mean Cmax in seminal fluid were 
0.499 and 68.9 ng/mL after a single SC dose of 2.5 and 20 mg/kg, respectively, indicating that the Cmax 
increased greater than dose proportionally.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
The toxicity of givosiran following a single dose was evaluated in rats as part of the pivotal 13-week repeat-
dose toxicity study (see section below).

Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetics were derived from the repeated dose studies in mice (AS1-DSM16-003, AS1-GLP17-006, AS1-
NCD14-005), in rats (AS1-NCD14-001, AS1-NCD14-010, AS1-GLP16-022 and AS1-GLP15-022) and in 
monkeys (AS1-NCD14-002, AS1-NCD14-011, AS1-GLP15-018). 
Givosiran was quickly absorbed after subcutaneous administration, with Tmax 0.5-1.0 h in mice, 0.5-2.0 h in 
rats and 1-4 h in monkeys. The exposure increased approximately dose-proportionally in mice and monkeys 
and dose-proportionally or more than dose-proportionally (at lower doses only) in rats. No relevant 
accumulation was observed in mice and monkeys. In rats, no significant accumulation or only slight 
accumulation (maximally 2-fold) was observed. Givosiran was removed fast from plasma with elimination 
half-life of 0.5-2.4 h in mice, 1.1-4.2 h in rats and 1.8-6.1 h in monkeys. The exposure was adequate in all 
species. It should be noted, however, that the compound had not left the body yet after one day in the rat 
(5x T1/2) but was still retained in the tissues, mainly liver, as about one third of the administered dose was 
still excreted between 168h and 1344h after dosing. 
Anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) were analysed in the 26-week rat study (AS1-GLP15-022) and in the 39-week 
monkey study (AS1-GLP15-018). All samples in the rat were negative. In the monkey study one sample was 
positive at 30 mg/kg/week (on day 169) and 3 samples were positive at 100 mg/kg/week, all from one 
animal (on days 85, 169 and 253).  
After subcutaneous administration to pregnant animals, Tmax (0.5-2.0 h) was comparable to non-pregnant 
animals. Exposure increased approximately dose-proportionally in pregnant rats and pregnant rabbits at 
lower dose, but slightly greater than dose-proportionally at higher doses. No accumulation was observed in 
pregnant rabbits. Elimination half-life was slightly higher in pregnant rats (4.0-6.6 h) than in non-pregnant 
rats (1.1-4.2 h). Elimination half-life in pregnant rabbits was 16.7 h. Maximal exposure was low in pregnant 
rats (maximally 1.7x human exposure based on AUC) and slightly higher in rabbits (maximally 5x human 
exposure).

The pharmacodynamic studies support the proof of principle that givosiran can reduce liver ALAS1 mRNA and 
subsequently serum ALA and PGB levels. However, the intended clinical treatment regimen of once per 
month has not been tested in animals. Monkey data show a mRNA reduction of only 20% after 4 weeks post-
dose, suggesting that monthly dosing would not be sufficiently efficacious in monkeys. The half-life of 
givosiran in the liver is substantially longer in humans than in monkeys, which is presumably caused by a 
faster metabolism in monkeys than in humans.  
No dedicated studies have been conducted to evaluate pharmacodynamic drug interactions. The potential for 
pharmacodynamic drug interactions with givosiran in humans is expected to be low since there are no other 
ALAS1 suppressive agents or other agents that affect ALAS1 production. 
A bioinformatic and in vitro analysis conducted to determine the potential for hybridization-based off-target 
effects of givosiran revealed a >100 fold difference between the “on-target” reduction of ALAS1 by givosiran 
and the reduction of any of the 6 nearest predicted off-target transcripts by transfection in human liver 
carcinoma cell line-G2 (HepG2) cells, confirming the specificity of givosiran for ALAS1. Potential off-target 
effects for the metabolite AS(N-1)3’ givosiran were not evaluated but the CHMP agreed that the off-target 
analysis carried out for the full length 23mer is representative of the potential off-targets of the AS(N-1)3′
givosiran metabolite and additional analysis was not considered necessary. 
The PK and ADME of givosiran have been characterized in vitro and in vivo. Givosiran shows similar patterns 
of PK and ADME properties across the nonclinical species tested in vivo and across human and animals in 
vitro. Collective data demonstrated that the SC administration of givosiran results in adequate exposure of 
the siRNA to the intended target organ (liver). Overall, PK and ADME studies provide support for the 
interpretation of toxicology studies and help characterize the disposition of givosiran in humans at the dosing 
regimen of 2.5 mg/kg once monthly. 
The givosiran metabolite, AS(N-3)5’ givosiran, was found in liver S9 fractions from mouse, rat, monkey and 
human, but in vivo (in plasma and liver of rats and monkeys and plasma of 2 human patients) this metabolite 
was not found, or at least not in substantial amounts. In vivo, only AS(N-1)3’ givosiran metabolite was 
detectable in relevant amounts. 
AS(N-1)3’ givosiran was the only circulating active metabolite in the plasma of rats, monkeys, and humans 
after SC administration. The collective data characterizing the metabolism of the antisense and sense strands 
demonstrated that the in vitro metabolic profiles for givosiran were comparable to those profiles observed 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/70703/2020 
Page 46/101 
from the in vivo study samples, and the overall metabolic profile of givosiran was similar across all species 
tested, including human. 
Toxicity of givosiran has been studied adequately. In the repeat-dose toxicity studies conducted in rats and 
monkeys, the rat was identified as the most sensitive species to givosiran-related effects, with the liver being 
identified as the primary target organ of toxicity in both the rat and monkey. No adverse findings were 
associated with chronic, weekly administration of givosiran to rats and monkeys at doses that achieved 
exposure multiples of 3.5- and 26.3 fold, respectively when compared to exposures achieved in patients 
receiving the maximum recommended human dose. In the 26-week rat study, angiectasis in the islets of 
Langerhans of the pancreas was observed. These findings did not occur after monthly dosing in rats and were 
not observed in monkeys. The effect is considered species specific with no evidence of relevance in humans. 
There was no evidence of carcinogenicity in the 26-week conducted in f Tg-rasH2 mice. A longer,  2-year 
carcinogenicity study in Sprague Dawley rats (AS1-GLP18-007), currently ongoing, will be submitted upon its 
completion. 
Givosiran had no genotoxic potential when assessed in a standard battery of genotoxicity assays. Chronic 
toxicity studies in both rats and cynomolgus monkeys did not reveal proliferative or inductive effects.  
Reproductive toxicity studies in rats did not suggest a direct cause for concern: a single skeletal variation was 
observed in foetuses and was not considered adverse. This finding was likely due to maternal hepatotoxicity 
and exposures were within the clinical range. Givosiran showed marked maternal toxicity in rabbits (including 
mean maternal body weight loss) and resulted in increased post-implantation loss as a result of increased 
early resorptions and a low incidence of skeletal variations. These findings are considered an indirect effect, 
secondary to maternal toxicity. No adverse developmental effects were observed in rats administered the 
maternally toxic dose of approximately 9 times the normalised maximum recommended human dose. 
In a post-natal development study in rats, there was no effect on growth and development of the offspring. 
No adverse effects were observed in the fertility of male and female rats when administered with givosiran. 
Dedicated studies were not conducted in juvenile animals. In the chronic monkey GLP toxicology study, 
givosiran was administered once weekly at dose levels between 10 and 100 mg/kg for 39 weeks, followed by 
a 13-week recovery phase. At initiation of the treatment, monkeys were 13 to 17 months old. Monkeys at 24 
to 36 months old are generally considered the corresponding development age of adolescent up to 12 years 
of age in human. Therefore, the available toxicology data in juvenile monkeys supports the administration of 
givosiran to adolescents, ≥12 years of age.  
Dedicated antigenicity studies were not conducted. Such studies were considered unnecessary based on 
absence of structural similarity to known antigenic compounds, distribution of givosiran, and nonclinical data. 
Givosiran PEC-surface water value is below the action limit of 0.01 µg/L and is not a PBT substance as log 
Kow does not exceed 4.5. Givosiran is therefore not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics effects of givosiran has been evaluated in all 4 clinical studies (see 
Section 2.4.1). The studies addressed single and multiple ascending doses, the metabolite profile and 
potential for drug-drug interactions with givosiran. Covariates affecting the pharmacokinetics of givosiran 
were evaluated by population pharmacokinetics. Pharmacokinetics of the primary active metabolite AS(N-1)3’ 
givosiran was also evaluated in most studies. Further, in vitro studies evaluating the drug-drug interaction 
potential of givosiran and exposure-response analyses have been performed. 
No radiolabeled mass balance study, thorough QT prolongation study, and dedicated studies in subjects with 
dedicated hepatic and renal impairment have been conducted but patients with renal and hepatic impairment 
were allowed to be enrolled in study 003 as was agreed in three protocol assistance meetings with the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) in July 2017 and March 2018 (EMEA/H/SA/3587/1/2017/PA/PR/III, 
EMEA/H/SA/3587/1/FU/1/2018/PA/PR/III, and EMEA/H/SA/3587/2/2018/PA/PR/I). Similarly, in agreement 
with the recommendations in the PIP adolescents could enrol in study 003. Immunogenicity of givosiran 
treatment was evaluated in all studies.  
The recommended dose of givosiran is 2.5 mg/kg once monthly, administered by subcutaneous (SC) injection 
in abdomen, thigh or upper arm.

Bioanalytical methods 
Givosiran and AS(N-1)3’givosiran were quantitated in human plasma and urine using validated LC-MS/HRAM 
and LC-MS/MS assays and are considered to have acceptable reproducibility. The pharmacodynamic markers 
ALA and PBG were determined in plasma and urine by LC-MS/MS assays validated in line with Guideline on 
Bioanalytical Method Validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 02). 
Population PK analysis 
Plasma pharmacokinetics of givosiran and AS(N-1)3’givosiran in the target population was evaluated by 
popPK analysis. Plasma PK data of givosiran and its active metabolite, AS(N-1)3’ givosiran, were described by 
simultaneous modelling of both analytes in a nonlinear mixed-effects modelling framework. 
Absorption of givosiran is described by a first-order process. Body weight was found to have a significant 
effect on Ka, with the model predicting a prolonged tmax and a slower absorption in higher body-weight 
patients receiving a higher absolute dose, and shorter tmax and faster absorption in lower body-weight 
patients receiving a lower absolute dose. The conversion of givosiran to its primary metabolite, AS(N-1)3’ 
givosiran, was incorporated as a first-order process in the model. Elimination from the central compartments 
for both givosiran and AS(N-1)3’ givosiran consisted of hepatic and renal clearances. Hepatic clearance for 
both analytes was considered equal and incorporated in the model. The renal clearance for both givosiran and 
AS(N-1)3’ givosiran (CLR) were fixed to individual patient’s baseline eGFR value. A dose effect on hepatic 
clearance of givosiran and AS(N-1)3’ givosiran was included to explain the greater than dose proportional 
increase in exposure observed at the 5.0 mg/kg dose in Study 001.  
Population PKPD analysis 
A population PK/PD model was developed to describe the time-course and estimate inter-individual variability 
of urinary ALA levels from pooled data following placebo and givosiran administration in CHE subjects and 
AHP patients. The model was used to support the dose and dosing interval and to support dosing in patients. 
This concerned semi-mechanistic model using active siRNA (givosiran and AS(N-1)3’givosiran concentrations 
over time in liver and RISC compartments in rat as input for PK, which were fixed and allometrically scaled to 
human, and an estimated PD. Hence variability observed in PK in subjects with CHE or AIP is not incorporated 
in the model, only variability in subjects with CHE or AIP in PD parameters is estimated.   
Covariate analysis indicated that age, body weight, renal impairment, sex, and race were not significant and 
therefore were not included the final PK/PD model. Four covariates were retained in the final PK/PD model: 
patient type (CHE subjects versus AHP patients) on IC50 for givosiran  and Synthesis rate constant of ALA 
(Kin, ALA), mild hepatic impairment on Kin,ALA, and baseline ALA on maximum inhibitory effect of givosiran 
on kin,ALA. The first-order rate constant between plasma and effect compartment was estimated to be 
0.00761 hr-1 (half-life=91 hours, 3.79 days).  
The Visual Predictive Check (VPC) plots for the final PK/PD model are presented in Figure 7.

Population ALA-Attack Analysis 
The objective of this analysis was to develop population models to describe the relationship between urine 
ALA levels and clinical activity, as measured by incidence of porphyria attacks (AAR). Separate models for 
ALA absolute model and ALA percent reduction were developed. The models were used to predict the AAR in 
patients and support the dose and dosing interval. 
Predicted AAR values from both models were similar; prediction of AAR for a Median Risk AHP patient treated 
with placebo (ALA Absolute Model: mean 9.29 attacks/year; ALA Percent Reduction model: mean 10.4 
attacks/year) and predicted AAR for a Median Risk AHP patient treated with 2.5 mg/kg QM givosiran (ALA 
AbsoluteModel: mean 1.87 attacks/year; ALA Percent Reduction Model: mean 1.88 attacks/year). However, 
there was high uncertainty in estimation of the ALA parameters especially for the absolute model.  
Historical AAR, prior hemin prophylaxis and baseline ALA (absolute model) were significant covariates, 
baseline age and gender not. AAR data were weighted by the number of observation days, which enables 
pooling of various studies since they had different treatment duration. Hemin was regularly used to recover 
from an attack and this influences ALA levels. Sensitivity analysis by excluding ALA data up to 12 days after 
hemin administration showed minimal impact on parameters from the original model where exclusion up to 3 
days was used. 
The model individual predictions followed the observed data reasonably well though there was some 
underestimation, converging to the mean. Both models seemed fit to predict the efficacy of givosiran in AHP 
patients there is considerable variability, nevertheless, the model estimated the ALA reductions from OLE 
extension study using 2.5 mg/kg and 1.25 mg/kg not used for model development, sufficiently well.

Absorption  
Mean plasma concentration-time profiles for givosiran and its active metabolite, AS(N-1)3’ givosiran in AIP 
subjects, after single and multiple dosing are shown in Figure 8.

multiple subcutaneous injections with 2.5 mg/kg givosiran in AIP subjects (Mean ± SD, study 
001C) 
Givosiran was rapidly absorbed from the SC injection site into plasma, the time to maximum plasma 
concentration (tmax) was 0.5 to 2 hours at the 2.5 mg/kg once monthly dose. At the 2.5 mg/kg once monthly 
dose, the steady state peak plasma concentrations of givosiran (Cmax) and area under the curve from time 
of dosing up to 24 hours after dosing (AUC24) were 321 ± 163 ng/mL and 4130 ± 1780 ng·h/mL, 
respectively, and corresponding values for the active metabolite were 123 ± 79.0 ng/mL and 1930 ± 1210 
ng·h/mL, respectively. Effect of site of injection (abdomen, thigh, upper arm) has not been reported.  
Absolute bioavailability has not been determined for givosiran but in rats the absorption of givosiran following 
SC administration was high >84% (study AS1-DSM17-018).  
Distribution 
The population estimate for the apparent central volume of distribution (Vd/F) was 10.4 L for both givosiran 
and AS(N-1)3’ givosiran.  
Givosiran is designed to be preferentially distributed to liver through the ASGPR-mediated hepatic uptake. 
This is reflected by the high liver to plasma AUC ratio of 4500 and 2500 in rats and monkeys, respectively, 
after SC dosing.  
PopPK model was used to estimate the fraction of givosiran taken up in the liver. The apparent fraction of 
givosiran dose in liver was 80.7% (90%CI 69%-90%), with 51.6% available as givosiran and 29.1% 
available as AS(N-1)3’givosiran.

Elimination 
At 2.5 mg/kg, the half-life of givosiran and AS(N-1)3’ givosiran was estimated to be approximately 5 hours. 
Apparent clearance (CL/F) of givosiran and AS(N-1)3’ givosiran was 36.6 L/h and 23.4 L/h, respectively.  
Givosiran is cleared from the plasma compartment by conversion to AS(N-1)3’givosiran, uptake in the liver, 
and urinary excretion. Contribution of the three pathways to the total clearance was estimated 36% 
(metabolism), 52% (liver uptake), and 12% (urine).   
After single and multiple givosiran dosing 5-14% and 4-13% of the dose were recovered in the urine over 24 
hours as unchanged givosiran and AS(N-1)3’ givosiran, respectively. The renal clearance ranged from 1.22 to 
9.19 L/h for givosiran and 1.40 to 12.34 L/h for the active metabolite. The fraction of dose excreted in urine 
as unchanged givosiran or AS(N-1)3’ givosiran was consistent across doses.  
Excretion of givosiran in urine was investigated only for 24 hours post-dosing, no mass balance study was 
conducted because of the slow elimination of givosiran related material observed in rat and monkey.  
Metabolism 
Givosiran is metabolised by exo- and endonucleases. AS(N-1)3’ givosiran is the main metabolite in plasma 
and urine with only traces of sense strand metabolites and AS(N-3) givosiran. In plasma the concentrations 
of AS(N-1)3’ givosiran were approximately half the concentrations of givosiran.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Mean AUC and Cmax of givosiran and AS(N-1)3’ givosiran increased approximately dose-proportionally across 
a dose range of 0.35 mg/kg to 2.5 mg/kg following single or multiple dosing. In study 001C and 002 (sparse 
sampling), it seemed that at doses greater than 2.5 mg/kg, givosiran exposure increased slightly greater 
than dose-proportionally suggesting saturation of liver uptake of givosiran, in popPK analysis dose was a 
covariate on hepatic clearance. 
There was no accumulation of givosiran and AS(N-1)3’ givosiran after multiple dosing.  
Special populations 
Special populations were evaluated by popPK analysis. A total of 125 subjects, 14 (11.2%) CHE subjects and 
111 (88.8%) AHP patients were included in the population PK modeling. The median age of subjects in the 
pooled dataset was 38 years with a range of 19 to 65 years.  Body weight ranged from 39.5 to 131 kg, with 
median of 66.2 kg.  Majority of subjects were female (88%) and white (80%).  There were 30 (24.0%) 
subjects with normal renal function, 59 (47.2%) subjects with mild renal impairment, 35 (28%) subjects with 
moderate renal impairment, and 1 (0.8%) subject with severe renal impairment at baseline. There were 112 
(89.6%) subjects with normal hepatic function, and 11 (8.8%) subjects with mild hepatic impairment, 1 
(0.8%) subject each with moderate and severe hepatic impairment at baseline. 
Body weight, renal function, dose and race (East Asian) were covariates in the popPK model, the differences 
were <30% compared to typical patient. Covariate effect of baseline age, patient population (CHE subjects 
versus AHP patients), sex, and hepatic function (normal versus mild hepatic impairment) was not statistically 
significant.

Although adolescents were allowed to be enrolled in study 003, none was because of the rarity of a high 
attack rate in adolescents. PopPK analysis predicted 22-40% lower exposure in adolescents compared to 
adults for givosiran and AS(N-1)3’givosiran 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The potential of givosiran for drug drug interaction has been investigated by in vitro studies. In vitro studies 
indicated a low interaction profile for givosiran as givosiran was not a substrate, inhibitor or inducer of CYP 
enzymes and transporters in vitro.  
Indirect inhibition of CYP enzymes by givosiran could not be excluded based on ex vivo and in vivo studies in 
rat and monkey and a DDI (cocktail) study was conducted in CHE patients. The effect of givosiran on the CYP 
enzymes was evaluated 28 days after subcutaneous injection of 2.5 mg/kg givosiran, which was 
approximately maximal PD effect. Givosiran treatment resulted in the following: 
- 1.3-fold increase in Cmax and approximately 3.1-fold increase in AUC0-inf of caffeine (CYP1A2 substrate) 
- 2.00-fold increase in Cmax and 2.4-fold increase in AUC0-inf of dextromethorphan (CYP2D6 substrate) 
- 1.1-fold increase in Cmax and 1.6-fold increase in AUC0-inf of omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate) 
- 1.2-fold increase in Cmax and 1.5-fold increase in AUC0-inf of midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate) 
- No effect on the exposure of losartan as geometric mean ratio was close to 1 (CYP2C9 substrate) 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Givosiran is designed to be selectively delivered to the liver using the binding between the GalNAc ligand of 
givosiran and ASGPR receptor expressed on the liver. Upon delivery to the liver, givosiran uses the naturally 
occurring RNAi pathway to specifically target and silence ALAS1 mRNA in the liver. The RNAi-mediated 
lowering of induced liver ALAS1 mRNA levels and the consequent sustained decrease in the accumulation of 
toxic heme intermediates ALA and PBG is expected to prevent or reduce the occurrence of serious 
neurovisceral attacks and ongoing symptoms in patients with AHP. 
Primary pharmacology 
The primary action of givosiran sodium is the reduction of the plasma levels of toxic metabolites ALA and 
PBG. Plasma ALA and PBG levels were shown to be highly correlated with corresponding urinary levels.  
The relationship between the dose and PD effect (ALA and PBG lowering) was investigated in the exploratory 
Study 001 with chronic high excreters (CHE) subjects as well as AIP patients. Givosiran sodium resulted in a 
rapid dose-dependent decrease in urinary ALAS1 mRNA levels, ALA and PGB levels.  
A modelling and simulation approach was employed to further quantitatively characterize the dose-response 
relationship for PD and clinical activity. According to the model, givosiran dosing resulted in a dose dependent

increase in ALA lowering with increasing givosiran doses leading to greater ALA lowering and lower 
interpatient variability in response (Figure 9).

Reduction in these PD biomarkers was also shown to correlate with the reduction in annualized attack rate 
(AAR) in the clinical studies as well as ALA/AAR modelling (Figure 10).

Immunogenicity 
Across the 4 clinical studies, there was only 1 case of treatment-induced ADA in 131 subjects (AHP patients + 
CHE subjects) who received givosiran. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pathophysiology of AHP is thought to be primarily attributed to the accumulation of toxic intermediate 
metabolites in heme synthesis, ALA and PBG. Givosiran aims to reduce the levels of these toxic metabolites 
by silencing the ALAS1 mRNA in the liver that is responsible for their synthesis. This is expected to prevent or 
reduce the occurrence of serious neurovisceral attacks as well as chronic symptoms and disability in patients 
with AHP. The choice of two main PD biomarkers in the givosiran clinical development program, urinary ALA 
and PBG, is therefore acceptable. 
Givosiran is designed to preferentially distribute to the liver by ASGPR-mediated uptake. This results in a 
short plasma half-life of approximately 6 hours after subcutaneous dosing with plasma concentrations 
declining to the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) within 24 hours post-dose. This contrasts with the 
sustained reductions in ALA and PBG in urine for months. Hence, the long duration of PD effect does not 
directly correlate with the plasma concentrations. This finding is in line with the non-clinical data that has 
been used to support the 2.5 mg/kg once monthly dosing regimen and demonstrated that the 
pharmacokinetics of givosiran in the target organ (liver) drives the long duration of PD effect  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/70703/2020

Due to the increase in the liver enzymes Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine Aminotransferase 
(ALT) in 7 out of 48 patients on 2.5 mg/kg givosiran dose observed in the DB period of the pivotal study 003 
(see Section 2.5) a lower 1.25 mg/kg was introduced in the OLE period of this study. However, the study 
design, not randomized dose assignment and the limited number of patients in every group does not allow a 
proper assessment of efficacy and safety of this dose. There seems to be no correlation between plasma 
exposure of givosiran and ALT elevations. However, the number of patients in the dose-finding studies was 
very small and does not allow to draw firm conclusions. From the data presented, a lower efficacy of this 
dose may be expected. 
In addition to the clinical studies, the adequacy of the selected 2.5 mg/kg once monthly dosing regimen was 
further supported by the population PK/PD modelling and simulations using data from Studies 001, 002, and 
003. In general, the model supported that the 2.5 mg/kg dose once monthly results in near maximum 
PD/clinical effects (for both dose-ALA and dose-AAR).  
It is proposed to dose givosiran as mg/kg. Body weight, renal function, dose and race (East Asian) were 
covariates in the popPK model, however, the differences were <30% compared to typical patient. No 
clinically relevant effect of age, sex, race, or body weight on the PK and PD of givosiran was observed or 
predicted by the PK/PD modelling. Similarly, PKPD was comparable across BMI ranges (<18.5, 18.5-25, >25 
kg/m2). Therefore, dosing based on body weight is agreed. No dose adjustment for adolescents >12 years 
old or elderly is considered necessary.  
Given the targeted delivery and uptake of givosiran to the liver via the ASGPR receptor (the expression of 
which in the cardiac tissue is negligible), as well as its physicochemical properties as a siRNA compound, it is 
not expected that givosiran might affect QT interval. Moreover, the data from the pre-clinical and clinical 
studies do not indicate any clinically relevant changes in QTc interval. No dedicated studies have been 
performed by the applicant to investigate pharmacodynamic interactions of givosiran with other medicinal 
products or substances. However, given the mechanism of action, no such interactions are expected. Hemin 
infusions lower ALA levels in blood and, therefore, have an effect on the ALA lowering by givosiran. Hemin 
was included as covariate in the population PKPD model and in the ALA-AAR analysis, urinary ALA data 
sampled within 3 days of hemin co-administration were excluded from analysis. Overall the effects of hemin 
are adequately accounted for and are not expected to have an impact on clinical efficacy or safety of the 
product.  
An in vivo interaction study showed that givosiran moderately reduced the activity of CYP1A2 and CYP2D6, 
weakly reduced the activity of CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, but had no impact on activity of CYP2C9. This is 
probably due to reduction of de novo heme synthesis in the liver as result of down regulation of ALAS1. The 
Applicant presented the possible impact of givosiran on use of concomitant medications in management of 
acute hepatic porphyria. Caution is recommended in the SmPC and dose adjustments may be considered 
when administering medicinal products that are substrates of CYP2D6 or CYP1A2 while on treatment with 
givosiran. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics of givosiran in the target organ (liver) drives the long duration of PD effect. Givosiran was 
causes a rapid dose-dependent decrease in urinary ALAS1 mRNA levels, ALA and PGB levels. The selected 2.5 
mg/kg once monthly dosing regimen was chosen based on the exploratory studies with CHE and AHP patients 
and is further supported by the population PK/PD modelling and simulations.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The selection of the dose and dosing frequency was supported by a Phase 1 single, placebo-controlled 
multiple-dose Study 001 in CHE subjects (Study 001a and b) and AIP patients (Study 001c) and an open-
label extension long-term dosing study in AIP patients (Study 002).  
In Study 001, CHE subjects givosiran caused a rapid dose-dependent decrease in urinary ALAS1 mRNA 
levels, ALA and PGB levels. The lowering effect, however, did not reach a plateau over the tested range (up 
to 2.5mg/kg). Due to this reason, as well as the fact that AIP patients have higher baseline levels of ALA and 
PBG compared to CHE subjects, higher doses were chosen for further studies with AIP patients: 2.5 mg/kg 
and 5 mg/kg every month or every 3 months. In AIP patients, monthly dosing interval was shown to be 
superior to the quarterly dosing interval in reducing urine ALA and PBG levels, as well as reducing AAR and 
hemin use. The 5 mg/kg dose did not seem to result in a much larger reduction in ALAS1 mRNA compared to 
the 2.5 mg/kg dose (Figure 11).

Quarterly Doses of Givosiran in AIP Patients

SEM=standard error of the mean. 
Note: Yellow triangles denote time of once quarterly doses, blue triangles denote time of once monthly doses. Dashed red 
line denotes the ULN for ALA and PBG 
Reduction in ALA and PBG also seems to be comparable between the two groups. However, the sample size 
in every group was very small (3 and 2 patients in 2.5 and 5 mg/kg monthly dose groups respectively). 
The optimal dose established in the Study 001 was confirmed in the OLE Study 002, as well as pivotal 
efficacy and safety Study 003. These studies indicate the sustained suppression of ALA and PBG levels after 
givosiran treatment at the 2.5 mg/kg once monthly dose for a long period of time (up to 35 months in the 
Study 002).

Adequacy of the selected 2.5 mg/kg once monthly dosing regimen was further supported by the population 
PK/PD modelling and simulations using data from Studies 001, 002, and 003. In general, the model 
supported that the 2.5 mg/kg dose once monthly seems to be near maximum PD/clinical effects for both 
dose-ALA and dose-AAR. Based on the simulations described, it is, therefore, expected that the lower dose of 
1.25 mg/kg will result in a lower ALA and AAR reductions. PKPD modelling also supported the once monthly 
dosing interval; a quarterly dosing interval was predicted to result in less reduction in ALA and AAR. This is in 
agreement with less reduction in ALA observed in study 001C in AIP patients.  
No clinically relevant effect of age, sex, race, or body weight on the PK and PD of givosiran was observed in 
the clinical studies or predicted in the pop PK/PD model. No dose adjustment for adolescents >12 years old 
or elderly are considered needed.

Treatments 
Eligible patients were randomized to receive either givosiran (2.5 mg/kg dose) or placebo (1:1) once monthly 
for up to 6 months. In light of liver transaminase elevations observed in some patients during this study, a 
lower givosiran dose of 1.25 mg/kg administered once monthly (QM) was introduced as a down-titration dose 
in patients who had study drug withheld due to transaminase elevations per protocol-specified dosing rules 
with protocol Amendment 2.  
After completion of the 6-month DB Period, patients were given the option of continuing into the OLE period 
and receiving treatment with givosiran for up to 29 months. Patients who enrolled in the OLE before protocol 
amendment 3 was implemented received 2.5 mg/kg givosiran once monthly. Patients who enrolled in the OLE 
after implementation of protocol amendment 3 received 1.25 mg/kg givosiran once monthly. Patients who 
were assigned to 1.25 mg/kg were permitted to have givosiran increased after month 13 to 2.5 mg/kg if they 
had inadequate disease control, as pre-specified in the study protocol.  
Use of hemin for the treatment of acute or ongoing porphyria attacks was allowed during the study and was 
recorded as a concomitant medication in the eCRF. Analgesic medications, including opioids (synthetic and 
non-synthetic substances [narcotics]) or non-opioids, such as non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), 
acetaminophen, or neuropathy medications (e.g., anti-depressants and anti-seizure medications), were 
permitted for the management of porphyria and for porphyria attacks, based on clinical judgment. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to assess the effect of givosiran versus placebo on the rate of porphyria attacks 
requiring hospitalization, urgent healthcare visit, or IV hemin administration at home in AIP patients.  
Secondary objectives (selection): 
• Evaluate the effects of givosiran, compared to placebo, on urinary ALA and PBG levels in patients with AIP 
• Evaluate the effects of givosiran, compared to placebo, on hemin usage in patients with AIP  
• Evaluate the effects of givosiran, compared to placebo, on the rate of porphyria attacks requiring 
hospitalization, urgent healthcare visit, or IV hemin administration at home in patients with any AHP

Sample size 
The planned total enrolment for the study was approximately 74 patients, including approximately 70 AIP 
patients. Seventy patients would have yielded at least 90% power to detect a 45% reduction in the AAR of 
the porphyria attack composite endpoint at a 2-sided 5% significance level assuming a mean AAR of 8, a 
standard deviation (SD) of 5 in the placebo arm (a mean of 4 and a SD of 2.9 for 6 months to preserve the 
over-dispersion of 3.8), and a mean AAR of 4.4 with SD of 3 in the givosiran arm (a mean of 2.2 and a SD of 
1.8 for 6 months to preserve the over-dispersion of 4.2), using a negative binomial model. This study design 
still had at least 80% power even if the dropout rate was as high as 15% under the same assumptions. 
Randomisation 
Subjects were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to 2.5 mg/kg givosiran or placebo SC injection QM for 6 months. 
Patients were stratified based on their disease severity (use of hemin prophylaxis regimen at the time of 
screening and by each patient’s historical AAR) and AHP type. As very few non-AIP patients were anticipated 
to be enrolled in the study, no additional stratification factors were considered for these patients.  
Allocations to the two doses (1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg) in the OLE period were not randomised. 
Blinding (masking) 
The main 6-months study period was double-blinded.  
Assessment report

Page 62/101 
  
  
 
Statistical methods 
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint was performed in AIP patients in the Full Analysis Set using a 
negative binomial regression model to compare AAR of composite attacks between treatment arms, including 
fixed effects of the treatment arms and the stratification factors and the logarithm of the amount of time as 
an offset variable. 
Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the robustness of the primary analysis from the following 
aspects: impact of potential under-counting of attacks; impact of potential under- or over-counting of attacks 
due to the 1-day window; per protocol analysis set; considering composite attacks as recurrent events. 
Secondary endpoints of ALA, PBG levels and PCS of SF-12 score in AIP patients were analysed using a mixed 
model for repeated measures (MMRM) model. The annualized days of hemin use in AIP patients and AAR of 
AHP were analysed using a negative binomial regression model similar to the one used for the primary 
endpoint. For daily worst scores in pain, nausea and fatigue, the area under the curve (AUC) of change from 
baseline and average change from baseline over 6 months in weekly mean scores in AIP patients were 
analysed using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model. 
An unblinded interim analysis will be conducted when approximately 30 AIP patients have completed at least 
3 months of the treatment period. The endpoint for this interim analysis is the ALA level at 3 months. 
Stopping for efficacy or futility is not planned in this study. 
For the final analyses of the 6 month-double blind primary treatment period, a significance level of 0.049 will 
be used to test the efficacy endpoints, reflecting a penalty of 0.001 for the unblinded interim analysis. A 
fixed-sequence testing strategy for the primary and secondary endpoints will be implemented to control the 
overall type I error rate. 
After database lock, it was observed that the data for ALA, PBG, pain, and nausea violated the assumptions 
of normality for the MMRM/ANCOVA models based on Q-Q plots and the Shapiro-Wilk test of normality. 
Therefore, a non-parametric Wilcoxon test was conducted to re-analyse these endpoints. 
Results 
Participant flow 
All patients (100%) completed the DB period of the study. Only one patient discontinued the treatment due 
to elevation in the liver enzymes (>8xULN). This patient completed the 6-month DB period and the 6-month 
Visit; however, the patient then withdrew from the study after the 6-month Visit and did not enter the OLE 
period. A total of 93 patients (98.9%) continued into the OLE period, where one more patient discontinued 
the treatment due to pregnancy and three patients discontinued because they no longer wanted to 
participate in the study.

DB period (4 patients with a total of 17 instances at 1 site over a period of 6 months and the site was 
retrained when this deviation was discovered) 
• One patient did not meet an inclusion criterion and was enrolled in the study (patient did not experience 2 
porphyria attacks requiring hospitalization, urgent healthcare visit or treatment with IV hemin at home within 
6 months prior to screening) (1 patient with 1 instance).  
• One patient did not meet an inclusion criterion and was enrolled in the study (willing to comply with the 
contraceptive requirements during the study period) (1 patient with 1 instance) 
Only the patients not meeting the minimum threshold of porphyria attacks was excluded from the Per 
Protocol Analysis Set as the other major protocol deviations were considered to not have an effect on the 
interpretation of efficacy results. In addition, none of the protocol deviations were considered to have an 
effect on the safety results. 
Three major global protocol amendments took place during the study:  
Amendment 1 (4 May 2018), was issued as part of the response to a single case of anaphylactic reaction 
reported in Study ALN-AS1-002 and provided guidance on monitoring, diagnosing and management of 
potential anaphylactic reactions.  
Amendment 2 (26 July 2018), was generated in response to liver transaminase elevations observed during 
the study and implemented a standard hepatic assessment panel if patients develop significant ALT elevation 
and provided specific guidance for re-challenge using a lower dose in patients whose ALT resolves after study 
drug dosing has been withheld due to ALT elevation.   
Amendment 3 (21 September 2018), in light of liver transaminase elevations observed in the study, a lower 
givosiran dose of 1.25 mg/kg once QM was introduced in Amendment 2 as a re-challenge dose for patients 
who resume dosing after resolution of liver transaminase elevations. In order to generate additional data at 
this dose level, evaluation of the 1.25 mg/kg once QM dose was proposed for patients crossing over to the 
OLE period under this amendment, after their completion of the 6-month DB period.

Numbers analysed 
The populations (analysis sets) for the 6-month DB period and the OLE period were defined as follows:  
• Full Analysis Set (FAS): All randomized patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug. Patients are 
grouped by their randomly assigned treatment group (ie, as randomized).  
• AIP patients in the Full Analysis Set (FASAIP): All randomized AIP patients (with identified mutation in the 
HMBS gene) who received at least 1 dose of study drug. Patients are grouped by their randomly assigned 
treatment group (ie, as randomized).  
• Per Protocol Analysis Set (PPS): All randomized AIP patients (with identified mutation in the HMBS gene) 
who received at least 4 doses (>60%) of study drug during the 6-month DB period, were followed for 
collection of attack data through 6 months (≥162 days) and did not experience major protocol deviations that 
may impact the primary efficacy results (eg, not meeting the key inclusion/exclusion criteria). Patients are 
analyzed according to their randomly assigned treatment group.  
•Safety Analysis Set: All patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug, grouped according to the 
treatment actually received. Patients who received at least 1 dose of givosiran during the 6-month DB period 
are included in the givosiran arm.  
• PK Analysis Set: All patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug and have evaluable PK data 
contributing to the estimation of PK parameter. 
• PD Analysis Set: All patients who received at least 1 dose of study drug and who have at least 1 post-dose 
urine sample for the determination of ALA or PBG are included in the PD analyses.  
• All Givosiran Treated Set: All patients who received at least 1 dose of givosiran, including patients who took 
givosiran during the 6-month DB period and patients who first took placebo during the 6-month DB period 
and switched to givosiran during the OLE period. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
Annualized Rate of Porphyria Attack Composite Endpoint  
The primary efficacy outcome of of annualized rate of porphyria attack composite endpoint is shown in 
Figure 13, demonstrating that 2.5 mg/kg once monthly givosiran treatment led to statistically significant 
reduction of 74% in the AAR of composite attacks compared to placebo in AIP patients (rate ratio=0.26, 
p<0.0001).

Figure 13. Average Number of Attacks per Patient Per Month During the DB and OLE Periods; 
Porphyria Attack Composite Endpoint in AHP patients (FAS), study ALN-AS1-003 
Abbreviations: AHP=acute hepatic porphyria; DB=double-blind; FASAIP=AIP patients in the full analysis set; 
IV=intravenous; OLE=open-label extension. 
Note: Month 0 represents the average rate per month from the 6 months prior to randomization, and the estimate was 
calculated as total number of attacks/total duration in months. Month 1 and beyond were categorized relative to the first 
dose of study drug, and the estimate was calculated as total number of attacks/total number of patients reached that 
month. One month=28 days was used in categorization. 
The results of all sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary analysis. The proportion of attacks 
with median pain score >7 was lower for givosiran patients (21.1%) compared to placebo patients (32.0%). 
The effect of givosiran was sustained in the OLE study: the composite AAR remained reduced for patients 
continuing on givosiran treatment and got reduced for patients switching from placebo to givosiran. 
Specifically, placebo patients crossing to the 2.5 mg/kg QM givosiran dose during the OLE period 
demonstrated a trend towards a larger reduction in composite AAR: 88% reduction in AAR for placebo 
patients who crossed over to the 2.5 mg/kg QM givosiran dose in the OLE and 76% reduction for placebo 
patients crossing over to the 1.25 mg/kg QM dose group through Month 12 based on intra-patient 
comparisons.  
Secondary endpoints 
Urinary ALA and PBG Levels 
Givosiran produced a substantial decrease in these toxic metabolites in both DB and OLE period: the median 
reduction for ALA was 86 and 84% in the DB and OLE period respectively and the median reduction for PBG 
was 91 and 78% in the DB and OLE period respectively. Similar results were seen in the overall AHP 
population. The 1.25 mg/kg givosiran dose was shown to produce somewhat lesser reduction in ALA and PBG 
compared to the 2.5 mg/kg dose.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/70703/2020 
Page 68/101 
  
  
 
 
 
Hemin Use 
Givosiran treatment led to a similar decrease in hemin use: 77% decrease in annualized days of hemin use 
with around 50% of patients having no need to use hemin at all. In the placebo group, 23.3% of patients had 
0 days of hemin use. Continued treatment with givosiran in the 6-month DB and OLE period 
(givosiran/givosiran patients) led to a maintenance of the effect observed in the 6-month DB period. Placebo 
group patients who crossed over to the 2.5 mg/kg QM givosiran dose in the OLE had a greater reduction in 
hemin use (>99% reduction), compared with the 1.25 mg/kg QM dose (54%) through Month 12, based on 
intra-patient comparisons. 
Pain Numerical Rating Score 
The study was not enriched for the baseline levels of pain. Therefore, the patients enrolled had mostly mild to 
moderate pain levels (with patients in the givosiran group having a somewhat lower score at baseline). 
Givosiran was shown to significantly reduce the pain levels and the treatment separation was greater for the 
patients with a baseline pain score ≥ 2, with no difference between treatments for patients with a baseline 
pain level <2.  
The treatment with givosiran led to a statistically significant difference in the AUC of change from baseline in 
weekly mean score of daily worst pain and average change from baseline in weekly mean score in AIP 
patients compared with placebo (p=0.0455 and 0.0493 respectively as per post-hoc Wilcoxon analysis). The 
absolute difference change in the median pain score between the groups was 0.5.  
Patients in the placebo/givosiran group had a median weekly mean pain score of daily worst pain of 3.50 at 
baseline. Following 6 months of placebo treatment, the median score increased by 0.1 of a point. At Month12 
(after 6 months of givosiran treatment), the median score dropped by 0.54 points, similar to the decrease in 
pain seen in patients who received givosiran initially in the 6-month DB period. 
The decreases in pain with givosiran treatment were also reported in the context of lower analgesic use 
(opioid and non-opioid) during and between attacks.  
Fatigue and Nausea Numerical Rating Score 
Givosiran treatment did not result in a significant change in the daily worst fatigue and daily worst nausea 
score.  
PCS of SF-12 
PCS score of SF-12 was shown to be significantly improved in patients on givosiran treatment (Figure 14). 
Placebo crossover patients had similar improvements in PCS scores in the SF-12 domain after 6 months of 
givosiran treatment in the OLE period as patients in the givosiran group had after 6 months in the DB period. 
Patients on givosiran 2.5 mg/kg QM treatment continuously through the Month 12 data-cut, demonstrated 
maintenance of improvement in PCS score in the SF-12 domain at Month 12.

Exploratory Endpoints 
All Porphyria Attacks: 
Consistent with the results observed for the porphyria attack composite endpoint, givosiran led to a reduction 
in the AAR of all attacks compared to placebo for both AIP patients (median AAR of 2.14 for givosiran and 
10.74 for placebo; 68.3% reduction) and AHP patients (median AAR of 2.14 for givosiran and 11.74 for 
placebo; 67.4% reduction) 
Analgesic Usage: 
Givosiran treatment led to a lower proportion of days with opioid use and nonopioid use over the 6-month DB 
period compared with placebo. The number of patients with at least 1 analgesic medication during the 6-
month DB period was lower in patients treated with givosiran compared with placebo over the 6-month DB 
period. Similar results were observed in AHP patients  
Quality of life 
Quality of life and patient experience measures were improved with givosiran compared to placebo. 
-
A larger proportion of givosiran AIP patients rated themselves as “very much improved” or “much
improved” since the start of the study at Month 6 compared with placebo (61.1% and 20.0%,
respectively), on the PGIC.
The overall patient experience was improved for givosiran compared to placebo, as demonstrated by “much 
better” ability since before the study on functional impacts, activities of daily living, and treatment 
satisfaction on the PPEQ in AIP patients

Ancillary analyses 
The subgroup analysis performed for the primary endpoint of composite AAR showed consistency in the 
efficacy of givosiran between different groups. Age, race, region, gender, body mass index (BMI) or medical 
history of the disease did not have an influence on the givosiran efficacy (Figure 15).

Month DB Period; Subgroup Analysis; AIP patients, study ALN-AS1-003 
Abbreviations: AIP=Acute intermittent porphyria; CI=Confidence interval; DB=double-blind; FASAIP =AIP Patients in Full 
Analysis Set; IV=Intravenous. 
Rate ratio and corresponding CIs were derived using negative binomial regression model with the logarithm of the follow-
up time as an offset variable.  
Note: Sex was not included as a subgroup because <10 patients were male. 
In addition to reducing the frequency of attacks, givosiran led to a reduction in the severity of composite 
attacks when they did occur.  Severe attacks were defined as attacks accompanied by severe pain (median 
pain score ≥7 on a 0 to 10 numerical rating scale) (Oldemanger 2013).   
The proportion of severe attacks is shown in Table 20.

Moreover, even among those patients who experienced at least 1 attack, a lower proportion of givosiran 
patients (41.7%) compared with placebo patients (63.2%) had a severe attack.   
The decrease in severe attacks on givosiran was accompanied by a lower proportion of givosiran patients 
compared to placebo using analgesics (opioids [75.0% vs 84.2%], IV opioids [37.5% vs 52.6%], and non-
opioids [58.3% vs 71.1%]) during composite attacks (refer to Appendix 1, Study 003, Table 60.1.40.2). 
In addition, while hospitalization for attacks may be determined by local healthcare treatment practices, 
hospitalization rates may also be reflective of attack severity. Givosiran led to a 43% reduction in attacks 
requiring hospitalization compared to placebo (refer to Study 003 CSR1 Table 19). 
Impact on Pain and Analgesic Use During and Between Attacks 
Consistent reduction in pain scores was found with givosiran whether the analyses included data from during 
or between attacks (also referred to as “not during attacks”).  For these analyses, “during attacks” included 
all Investigator-adjudicated porphyria attacks (the porphyria attack composite endpoint plus attacks at home 
not treated with hemin), which is the most appropriate way to conduct these analyses given that all attacks 
during the study, regardless of treatment location or treatment type, were characterized by worsening 
porphyria symptoms beyond the patient’s normal day-to-day variability and required treatment beyond their 
usual daily management.  The median of change from baseline in daily worst pain between attacks (ie, not 
during attacks) was lower (more improvement) for givosiran than placebo (Figure 16, right panel).

Changes <0 indicate improvement. 
Placebo patients received placebo during the DB period and crossed over to givosiran during the OLE period. 
Note: All Investigator-adjudicated attacks are included. 
In addition, on days between attacks, givosiran consistently demonstrated a lower proportion of days with 
daily pain scores across a range of ≥2 to ≥7 as well as a lower proportion of days with a daily pain score 
worse than baseline compared to placebo (data not shown). 
The reduction in pain with givosiran was not attributable to increased analgesic use as it was accompanied by 
a lower proportion of patients requiring analgesic use during and between all attacks (Figure 17).

Similar improvements in pain and reduced analgesic use between attacks were observed for composite 
attacks (data not shown). No significant changes were observed in daily worst fatigue or nausea scores 
during the 6-month randomized DB period of the study.  
Efficacy in non-AIP patients 
Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is the most common AHP subtype, and therefore 5 non-AIP patients o 
were included in the study. Efficacy results for these patients is summarized in Table 21.

Not applicable. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
The maximum age of the patients included into the givosiran clinical program was 65 (one patient). 
The influence of renal or hepatic impairment on givosiran PD was assessed across the studies. Only 5 
patients with mild hepatic impairment and none with moderate or severe hepatic impairment were included in 
the study. Also, 25 patients with mild and 10 patients with moderate renal impairment were enrolled. Even 
though the results are variable due to the low number of patients in every group, the PD response of 
givosiran did not seem to be affected.  
Supportive studies 
Study 001C was a randomized, placebo-controlled study conducted in AIP patients testing four dose 
regiments: 2.5 mg/kg givosiran once monthly, 2.5 mg/kg givosiran once quarterly, 5 mg/kg givosiran once 
monthly, and 5 mg/kg givosiran once quarterly.  
Study 002 is an ongoing open-label, long-term extension study in AIP patients who have completed Study 
001C. After completion of the evaluation period in Study 001, eligible patients from Part C transitioned into 
this study to receive givosiran treatment for an additional 3 years.  
Both studies are small (16-17 patients), but overall support the beneficial effects of givosiran on various 
clinical parameters, including AAR, ALA & PBG levels, hemin use or quality of life.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The data contributing to the efficacy of givosiran in patients with AHP come from 3 clinical studies: one dose-
finding study in the AHP patients (001C), an open-label extension of this study (002) and a single pivotal trial 
(003), which is acceptable given the rarity of the disease. The pivotal study is a phase 3 randomized double-
blind, placebo-controlled multicentre study with an open-label extension to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
givosiran in patients with AHP.  
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/70703/2020 
Page 78/101 
Since currently no treatment is available to manage AHP (apart from hemin which is indicated for the 
treatment of acute porphyria attacks, though not approved to reduce the risk of attacks), the use of placebo 
as a comparator is supported. The trial duration is considered sufficient to assess the primary endpoint and 
some secondary endpoints.  
The goal of givosiran treatment is to prevent acute porphyria attacks by reducing the plasma levels of toxic 
metabolites, ALA and PBG, which are thought to be responsible for these attacks and other chronic disease 
manifestations. Therefore, the choice of a porphyria attack composite endpoint as a primary endpoint and 
urinary ALA/PBG levels as secondary endpoints is supported. The porphyria attack composite endpoint is a 
relevant clinical endpoint, which consists of the most common and severe type of attacks (attacks requiring 
hospitalization, urgent healthcare visit, or IV hemin administration at home). Hemin infusions are a big 
burden on its own for the AHP patients and they also carry the risks of morbidities, such as iron overload or 
infections due to the catheter lines. Therefore, the reduction in need of such infusions is of benefit to the 
patient and is supported as a secondary endpoint. All other patient reported outcomes (e.g. daily worst pain, 
nausea, fatigue and quality of life) are also considered of importance since AHP is a chronic disease with 
manifestations of pain and low quality of life even between the attacks. The short period of time used to 
collect baseline data for these parameters and the differences in the collection of patient reported outcomes 
before and during the study, however, brings uncertainties to the data interpretation. The data on the cross-
over patients from placebo (6 months data in the DB period) to givosiran (>6 months in the OLE period) can, 
however, be used as supportive in this case. In general, the objectives and efficacy endpoints of the pivotal 
and supportive studies are clearly defined and are considered clinically relevant.  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are acceptable. The study population is reflective of the population with 
AHP but was enriched for the attack rate: only patients with more than 2 attacks in the past 6 months were 
eligible to enrol in the study. Adolescents >12 years were allowed to enrol in the study. However, due to the 
rarity of these patients, none was eventually enrolled. Subjects with moderate or severe liver impairment 
were excluded from the study, which is understandable given the known liver safety toxicity profile for this 
class of drugs.  
The randomization strategy is in general satisfactory. Patients were stratified based on their disease severity 
(historic attack rate) and AHP type. The characteristics of the patients in the placebo and givosiran groups 
were well balanced. An interim analysis in the DB of the Study 003 period was planned, but not used due to 
the fast study enrolment. All patients completed the 6-month DB period of the study and were included in the 
main analysis set. 
The primary endpoint, annualised attack rate, was analysed using a negative binomial regression model. 
Sensitivity analyses tested the impact of attack data collection, model assumptions and missing data 
handling. Secondary rate endpoints (days of hemin use and AAR in AHP patients) were analysed using 
negative binomial regression. Change from baseline in pain, nausea or fatigue was analysed using ANCOVA 
and change from baseline in ALA, PGB, PCS and SF-12 by MMRM. A fixed-sequence testing strategy for the 
primary and secondary endpoints is used to control the overall type I error rate. These methods are 
considered acceptable. 
The endpoints ALA, PBG, pain and nausea were re-analysed using a non-parametric Wilcoxon test, after a 
Shapiro-Wilk test indicated the assumption of normality was violated. Although this is a standard procedure, 
it was introduced post-hoc. Since the primary analysis models are relatively robust against a deviation, both 
the parametric and the non-parametric tests are considered of importance.

The selection of the dose tested in the pivotal study (2.5 mg/kg) as well as the monthly dosing interval can 
be considered reasonably characterized and justified based on the PK/PD data from the dose-finding and 
supportive studies. Due to the elevations in the liver enzymes observed in some of the patients following 
givosiran treatment, a lower dose (1.25 mg/kg) was introduced as per Protocol Amendment 2 and 3 as 
down-titration.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Treatment with givosiran resulted in a rapid, clinically meaningful and statistically significant decrease 
(approximately 75%) in the composite AAR in both AIP and AHP populations, as indicated by the analysis of 
FASAIP and FASAHP. Importantly, 50% of patients in the givosiran group had 0 attacks. The number of non-
AIP patients in the clinical development program is very low (5). Only five non-AIP patients received 
givosiran in the Study 003 and one patient was treated with givosiran in the Compassionate Use Program. 
One of these patients discontinued the dosing after the 3d dose due to the ALT elevation 9.9 x ULN and 
another one discontinued the study after the 2d dose because the patient had no wish to participate in the 
study any longer. Givosiran seems to have a beneficial effect on the ALA/PBG levels, as well as AAR in this 
patient population as well, even though the data is considered very limited.  Nevertheless, extrapolation to all 
AHP subtypes was considered acceptable by the CHMP based on a common pathophysiology (e.g 
accumulation of toxic porphyrins ALA and PBG) and the PK/PD and safety data of givosiran. 
No adolescents participated in the study. However, similar PD effect is expected between different body 
weight categories and therefore similar efficacy is expected in this population (please see PD section for more 
discussion). Therefore, the indication for adolescents is acceptable. 
The effects of the proposed 2.5 mg/kg dose have been sufficiently demonstrated. The efficacy and safety 
data of the lower dose, 1.25 mg/kg, is, however, very limited. The study design, small number of patients in 
every group, the non-randomized assignment of the patients to two doses in the OLE period, do not allow for 
an adequate assessment of efficacy and safety of the 1.25 mg/kg dose. This is reflected as a warning in the 
SmPC. This dose is reserved only for resumption of treatment in patients who had to discontinue givosiran 
due to clinically relevant transaminase elevations.  
The subgroup analysis performed for the primary endpoint of composite AAR showed consistency in the 
efficacy of givosiran between different groups. Age, race, region, gender, BMI or medical history of the 
disease did not have an influence on the givosiran efficacy. The mild hepatic impairment or mild to moderate 
renal impairment does not seem to influence PD of givosiran. The influence of moderate to severe hepatic 
impairment on givosiran effects was not assessed in the clinical program that brings some uncertainties to 
the safety of the product in this patient group. An appropriate warning is included in the SmPC indicating that 
the efficacy and safety of givosiran was not properly studied in the population with moderate or severe 
hepatic impairment. Additional efficacy and safety data in these patient populations should be collected post-
marketing.  
Available results indicate that the treatment meets a high medical need in AHP patients by significantly 
reducing the frequency of severe porphyria attacks. Chronic symptoms of the disease (mostly neurological 
pain) can originate from the chronic elevations of the ALA/PBG levels in some patients even between the 
attacks, but they are also long-lasting consequences on nerve (and other organs) damage during the attacks. 
The Applicant presented data on pain levels, as well as analgesics use during and between attacks. From the 
data it can be concluded that the pain levels decreased in patients on givosiran both during and between 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/70703/2020 
Page 80/101 
attacks. Even though the absolute decrease in pain score is rather moderate in general, its relevance is 
supported by the reduction in the opioid and non-opioid analgesics use by approximately 10% between the 
attacks and 17% during the attacks. Moreover, the proportion of the attacks with a pain score >7 was lower 
in the givosiran group, suggesting the beneficial effects of givosiran on attack severity as well.   
In addition, givosiran showed beneficial effects on the QoL and physical functioning. In the Patient Global 
Impression of Change (PGIC) a larger proportion of patients with AIP treated with givosiran (61.1%) than 
with placebo (20%) rated their overall status as “very much improved” or “much improved” since the start of 
the study. Importantly, bodily pain domain of the SF-12 during the attack-free recall period showed greater 
improvement on givosiran treatment compared to placebo, supporting the results on the general pain levels 
and reduced analgesics use between the attacks, even though the number of patients in every comparison 
group is limited. From the data presented, it can be assumed that the effects of givosiran on the patient 
reported outcomes improve further overtime, which is expected, given that chronic neurologic impairment 
requires a prolonged rehabilitation. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the data presented show that givosiran, in addition to reducing the attack frequency, has an effect 
on various aspects of patient wellbeing, such as pain and analgesics use between attacks, QoL and social 
engagement of the patents and thus is an effective treatment for the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria 
(AHP) in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older.

Notes: If a patient experienced more than 1 event in a given category, that patient was counted only once in that 
category. A patient can contribute to multiple events in the number of events. Includes AEs occurring or worsening on 
or after the first dose of study drug and before the first dose of the OLE period for patients who entered into OLE or 
through 28 days after the last dose or any study drug related AEs for patients who discontinued treatment during the 
double-blind period. Preferred terms are sorted by decreasing frequency in the Difference column. 
In the Overall Pooled Experience, AEs were reported in 94.6% of patients. AEs reported in ≥15% of patients 
receiving givosiran included events coding to the PTs of nausea (32.4%), ISR (24.3%), fatigue (22.5%), 
nasopharyngitis (22.5%), headache (19.8%), and abdominal pain (18.0%). AEs considered related to 
givosiran treatment by the Investigator were reported in 65.8% of patients. Related AEs occurring in ≥5% of 
patients were: ISR (24.3%), nausea (18.0%), fatigue (9.9%), injection site erythema (7.2%), asthenia 
(6.3%), ALT increased (6.3%), AST increase (6.3%), and headache and vomiting (5.4% each). AEs over time 
in patients treated with givosiran in the Overall Pooled Experience tended to remain stable over the course of 
exposure.

In the Overall Pooled Experience, SAEs were reported in 28 (25.2%) patients treated with givosiran. The 
SAEs reported in 2 or more patients were abdominal pain, pyrexia, influenza, UTI, and chronic kidney 
disease; these events occurred in 2 patients each (1.8%). There was a total of 4 SAEs related to study drug 
(1 event of anaphylaxis, 1 event of LFT abnormal, 1 event of CKD, and 1 event of transaminases increased).

Death 
The only fatal event (haemorrhagic pancreatitis) during the givosiran treatment occurred in the Study 001 in 
a patient receiving a 5mg/kg monthly dose. The patient had a complex medical history and a gallbladder 
sludge at the time of presentation. 
Laboratory findings 
No significant changes in haematology or serum chemistry parameters were observed during the DB period of 
the Study 003. A higher proportion of patients in the placebo group reported lipase or amylase elevations 
compared to the givosiran group. On the other hand, more patients in the givosiran group experienced 
ALT/AST elevation, creatinine elevation and decrease in eGFR. Most of these elevations were transient and 
resolved during the study.  
A trend in a transient decrease in the diastolic blood pressure was observed on givosiran treatment, with no 
apparent change in the systolic blood pressure. Electrocardiograms did not reveal any abnormalities on 
givosiran treatment. 
Safety in special populations 
Only one patient of 65 years old was included to the clinical development program. No patients above that 
age were studied.  
No clear influence of gender, race, BMI or geographic region on the givosiran safety profile was observed. A 
somewhat higher frequency of AEs was reported in the older patient group (≥38 years of age) in both placebo 
and givosiran treatment groups. More patients with prior hemin prophylaxis reported AEs (84.8%) compared 
to the patients with no prior hemin prophylaxis (76.9%). However, more patients with no prior hemin 
prophylaxis reported SAE (20%) compared to the patients with prior hemin prophylaxis (15.2%). 
The AEs associated with hepatic or renal events were usually reported in individuals with pre-existing 
hepatic/renal condition. Three patients who had moderate renal function at baseline (eGFR ≥30 to <60 
ml/min/1.73 m2) progressed to severe renal impairment during the study (eGFR <30 ml/min/1.73 m2). 
No data is available on the use of givosiran in pregnant women and it is unknown whether givosiran is 
excreted in human milk.  
Immunological events 
Anti-drug antibodies were assessed over the course of each study. Overall, the incidence of treatment-
emergent ADA in givosiran-treated patients was low (one patient). The presence of ADA did not affect the 
safety profile of givosiran. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
In the Study 004 DDI study with CHE patients, givosiran resulted in a moderate reduction (≤3.07-fold) in 
activity of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A2 and CYP2D6, weak reduction (≤1.59-fold) in activity of CYP3A4 and 
CYP2C19 and had no effect on CYP2C9 activity. No additional concerns were raised with respect to the safety 
of givosiran. 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/70703/2020 
Page 86/101 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Overall, four patients on givosiran discontinued the studies 001/002 or 003. Three of them discontinued due 
to the development of a SAE (ALT elevation, anaphylactic reaction or haemorrhagic pancreatitis) and one 
patient discontinued the OLE period of the Study 003 due to pregnancy.  
In the overall pooled givosiran experience, AEs leading to treatment interruption occurred in 8.1% of 
patients; of the patients with dose interruptions, 7 were in Study 003 and 2 occurred in Study 001C/002. AEs 
leading to dose interruption in more than 1 patient are CKD (2 patients) and ALT/AST elevations (2 patients).

Not applicable. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Data from one pivotal study and two supportive studies comprise the safety database. Overall exposure to 
givosiran is limited but this is considered acceptable, considering the rarity of the disease.  
In general, the trial population is representative of the target population. Data on adolescents (≥ 12 year of 
age and ≤18) is absent (due to the extreme rarity of the condition in those age groups ) and almost absent in 
the elderly. However, pharmacokinetic data suggest that exposure to givosiran is not age-dependent and 
therefore the safety profile in those age groups is expected to be similar to that observed in the development 
programme of givosiran. Similarly data in the elderly or in patients with various stages hepatic impairment 
and severe renal impairment is either absent or limited and use of givosiran in such patients is included as 
missing information in the RMP. 
The frequency of total adverse events and SAE related to the study drug was higher in the givosiran 
treatment group compared to placebo in the pivotal study. In the overall pooled experience, 65.8% patients 
experienced treatment-related AE and 3.6% experienced SAE. One death occurred in the givosiran treatment 
group (due to haemorrhagic pancreatitis). Three out of four patients discontinued the studies because of SAE, 
and nine patients had a dose interruption due to the AE.  
Adverse events that were most frequently reported in the givosiran group are injection site reaction, nausea, 
fatigue, ALT elevation, rash, eGFR decrease and CKD. Most of the AEs were mild or moderate in severity and 
have resolved over the course of the study, with the exception of several events of CKD or fatigue. A recall 
phenomenon in the place of a previous injection brings some uncertainties to whether the drug might have 
an effect on the immune system systemically. One case of anaphylactic reaction was reported following 
givosiran use (in a patient with a history of various allergies and asthma). Overall, the adverse events 
observed in the study are listed in the SmPC.  
The elevation in liver function test is dose-dependent and consistent with the toxicological data and known to 
be associated with siRNA use. Currently, the SmPC includes a warning and recommendations on the 
monitoring of serum transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin. Moreover, a warning on the dose 
resumption after the treatment interruption is included in the SmPC due to the reported significant 
transaminase elevations. The transaminase elevations following givosiran treatment were more frequently 
reported in patients with a history of hepatic disorders or history of ALT elevations compared to patients with 
no history of hepatic disorders or ALT elevations. A similar situation was observed with AEs associated with 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/70703/2020 
Page 87/101 
renal events that were usually reported in individuals with pre-existing CKD and reduced eGFR. Therefore, 
patients with the history of hepatic or renal disorders require an additional safety warning in the SmPC to 
highlight an increased risk of givosiran side effects in these vulnerable patient populations. Hepatic and renal 
effects are also included in the RMP as important potential risks. 
Pancreatic dysfunction in patients with AHP including elevations in amylase or lipase, acute and chronic 
pancreatitis have been reported in the literature and supported in a natural history study in AHP patients and 
claim database studies. In clinical studies, two cases of pancreatitis were reported, including one fatal case in 
Study 001, that was considered unlikely related to givosiran in the context of the patient’s medical history, 
the presence of significant comorbidities. The other case was from the open-label extension phase of Study 
003. The event was also considered unlikely related to the drug by the investigator, given the alternative
aetiology of cholelithiasis in the setting of elevated alkaline phosphatase levels. Nevertheless, pancreatitis
has been added as an important potential risk in the RMP.
Longer-term safety as well as further characterisation of the effect of givosiran on hepatic and renal effects, 
pancreatitis and in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment and with ESRD or on dialysis will be 
collected in a planned AHP Registry. Additional information on these safety concerns is also expected from 
the ongoing open-label extension phase of studies ALN-AS1-002 and 003. 
Givosiran does not seem to result in changes in haematology or serum chemistry parameters. No clear 
influence of intrinsic or extrinsic factors on the givosiran safety profile was observed, aside the renal or 
hepatic impairment. Due to the lack of data, givosiran should only be considered in pregnant or lactating 
women if the benefits for the mother outweigh the risks for the foetus. Use in pregnant or lactating women 
and effects on pregnancy outcomes are included in the RMP as missing information and will be also 
investigated in the planned disease Registry. 
Finally, the carcinogenic potential for givosiran is being investigated in an ongoing 104-Week subcutaneous 
carcinogenicity study in Sprague Dawley rats which will be submitted once completed. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Despite the limited size of the safety database, due to the rarity of AHP, the overall safety profile of givosiran 
is considered acceptable. The main safety concerns are the potential effects of treatment on the liver and the 
kidney which are addressed adequately through appropriate routine risk minimisation measures. Further 
information is also expected through the planned post-authorisation studies.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.5 is acceptable. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 20 November 2019. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the 
IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of givosiran with active substances contained in authorised medicinal 
products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of isomers, 
complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers givosiran to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/70703/2020 
Page 94/101 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Givlaari (givosiran) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as: 
• It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal
product authorised in the EU;
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3. Benefit-Risk Balance
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Givlaari has been developed for “the treatment of acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) in adults and adolescents 
aged 12 years and older”.  
Acute hepatic porphyria (AHP) is a family of rare, serious, and severely debilitating genetic disorders of liver 
heme synthesis. Symptoms arise due to accumulation of the toxic heme intermediates aminolevulinic acid 
(ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG). In these patients, expression of delta-aminolevulinate synthase 1 (ALAS1) 
is induced in the presence of a pathogenic loss of function gene mutation in a downstream heme synthesis 
enzyme. There are 4 subtypes of AHP, each involving a defect in a distinct heme pathway enzyme, with acute 
intermittent porphyria (AIP) being the most common AHP subtype representing approximately 80% of all AHP 
cases.  
Most severe AHP patients (5-10%) have recurrent attacks (≥ 4 per year). Each porphyria attack is serious, 
highly morbid, and carries potential for permanent disability, and where specific treatment is delayed or not 
available, attacks can be life-threatening. Due to unpredictability and severity of porphyria disease 
manifestations, many patients are unable to work or attend school, have decreased socialization, and 
increased rates of depression and anxiety. 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/70703/2020 
Page 95/101 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current treatment options for AHP are limited. Patients are initially treated with supportive care during the 
attacks such as intravenous (IV) glucose, typically large doses of IV opioid analgesics, and antiemetics along 
with the removal of known precipitating triggers, such as certain medications or fasting [Bissell 2017; 
Bonkovsky 2013; Stein 2013]. Intravenous hemin is the only therapy currently approved for the treatment of 
acute attacks; hemin is not approved as a chronic treatment to prevent attacks [Bissell 2015]. While hemin 
infusion temporarily reduces production of ALA and PBG through feedback inhibition of ALAS1 messenger 
ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression, it has a short duration of action (elimination half-life of approximately 11 
hours), which limits its effectiveness and permits residual attack activity when used prophylactically. 
Moreover, they are a big burden for AHP patients as they carry the risk of morbidity, such as iron overload or 
infections due to the catheter lines. The repeated use of hemin commonly causes venous access problems in 
AHP patients. 
Additional treatments for AHP include chemically induced menopause with hormonal suppression therapy 
(e.g. gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists) and liver transplantation for patients with refractory disease 
or those who no longer have adequate venous access.  
Consequently, there is a clear unmet need for therapies that durably decrease the frequency of debilitating 
attacks, diminish chronic symptoms, and improve patients’ physical functioning and quality of life. In 
addition, therapeutics that reduce the need for opioid analgesics or drugs requiring chronic indwelling central 
venous catheters would reduce morbidity associated with these interventions. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy comes from a single phase III randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled 
multicentre study with an open-label extension to evaluate the efficacy and safety of givosiran in patients 
with AHP who experienced at least 2 attacks in the past 6 months (n=94). The 6-month double-blind (DB) 
period of this study, in which patients received 2.5 mg/kg givosiran or placebo SC once monthly, forms the 
primary demonstration of efficacy of givosiran.  
The ongoing OLE period, in which patients receive 2.5 or 1.25 mg/kg givosiran SC once monthly, will provide 
additional information on efficacy and safety of givosiran and will continue for up to 29 months.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The treatment with givosiran 2.5 mg/kg dose monthly resulted in a rapid and statistically significant decrease 
(approximately 75%) in the AAR in the AIP population (primary endpoint): rate ratio 0.26 (95%CI: 0.16, 
0.41, p<0.001) in favour of givosiran. In total, 50% of patients in the givosiran group and 17.4% of patients 
in placebo group had 0 attacks.  
The results of some secondary endpoints were in line with the primary endpoint: givosiran decreased ALA 
(86% from the baseline) and PBG (91% from the baseline) levels in AIP patients, while ALA and PBG levels in 
the placebo group remained relatively stable and elevated well above normal. The difference in LS Mean 
between givosiran and placebo was -18.2 mmol/mol Cr (95% CI: -17.97, -9.63, p<0.001) for ALA and -
27.48 mmol/mol Cr (95% CI: -34.04, -20.99, p<0.001) for PBG. Also, the number of days of hemin use 
significantly decreased following givosiran treatment with a rate ratio of 0.23 (95% CI: 0.11 0.45, p<0.001).  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/70703/2020 
Page 96/101 
  
  
Treatment with givosiran reduced the weekly mean score of daily worst pain compared with placebo in AIP 
patients (measured as mean change from baseline in the AUC) with median of treatment difference 0.5 
(p=0.0455) on a 10-point VAS. Moreover, givosiran treatment led to the decrease in opioid and non-opioid 
analgesics use during and between attacks.  
Subgroup analyses were performed for the primary endpoint of the composite AAR based on age, race, 
region, gender, BMI and medical history of the disease. These factors did not have an influence on givosiran 
efficacy.  
These effects were also shown to be sustained in the OLE period of the Study 003, where patients who 
received placebo in the DB period also switched to the givosiran treatment. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The applicant is applying for an indication in the overall AHP population. However, data on non-AIP patients is 
very limited. In total, only 5 non-AIP patients participated in the givosiran clinical trials. However, based on 
the common pathophysiology of all sub-types of AHP and the consistent results in the small number of non-
AIP patients treated with givosiran, the proposed broad indication is considered acceptable.  
Patients with moderate/severe hepatic impairment or severe renal impairment were excluded from the study. 
However, mild hepatic impairment and mild to moderate renal impairment did not seem to influence PD or 
efficacy of givosiran and the product information states the lack of data in these sub-group of patients. 
No adolescents or elderly patients >65 years of age were enrolled to the study. The efficacy in these groups 
is therefore largely extrapolated from the adult population and pharmacokinetic data which suggest that age 
was not a significant covariate in the pharmacokinetics of givosiran.  
The short study duration as well as the data collection approach does not allow for a full appreciation of the 
givosiran effects on all the studied chronic symptoms and patient reported outcomes. However, the data 
presented  by the applicant suggest that: 1) givosiran positively affects not only attack frequency, but also 
severity (based on pain scores and analgesics use during the attacks); 2) givosiran has a positive effect on 
pain and analgesics use also between the attacks; and 3) the quality of life as well as patient social 
engagement improves substantially on givosiran treatment. Therefore, the indication “treatment of AHP” is 
acceptable.      
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The frequency of total adverse events (AE) and serious adverse events (SAE) related to the study drug was 
higher in the givosiran treatment group compared to placebo in the pivotal study. One death occurred in the 
givosiran treatment group in the supportive OLE Study 002 (due to haemorrhagic pancreatitis). Three out of 
four patients who discontinued the studies did so because of an SAE (2.7%), and nine patients had a dose 
interruption due to the AE (8.1%).  
Adverse events that were most frequently reported in the givosiran group compared to placebo are injection 
site reaction (25% vs 0%), nausea (27.1% vs 10.9%), fatigue (10.4% vs 4.3%), ALT elevation (8.3% vs 
2.2%), rash (6.3% vs 0%), eGFR decrease (6.3% vs 0%) and CKD (10.4% vs 0%). Most of the AEs were 
mild or moderate in severity and resolved over the course of the study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/70703/2020 
Page 97/101 
  
  
SAE were reported during the studies including one case of anaphylactic reaction (in a patient with a history 
of various allergies and asthma), one fatal case of haemorrhagic pancreatitis and one case of obstructive 
pancreatitis (in patients with a complex medical history). 
The elevation in LFT is a known dose-dependent side effect of this type of siRNA compounds that target the 
liver and is consistent with the non-clinical data. The data from the pivotal study suggest that LFT elevations 
following givosiran treatment were more frequently observed in patients with a history of hepatic disorders or 
history of ALT elevations compared to patients with no history of hepatic disorders or ALT elevations. A 
similar situation was observed with AEs associated with renal events that were usually reported in individuals 
with pre-existing CKD and reduced eGFR. No clear influence of other intrinsic or extrinsic factors on the 
givosiran safety profile was observed. Furthermore, givosiran does not seem to result in significant changes 
in haematology or serum chemistry parameters.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The main limitation of the current safety database is the low number of patients in the clinical program due 
to the rarity of the disease and the short duration of exposure. This rather short follow-up and small sample 
size bring some uncertainties to whether all the potential side effects of the treatment are captured within the 
study and if any of the adverse effects might re-occur or persist for a longer period of time.  
Data on adolescents (12-18 years old) or patients >65 years of age is absent (due to the rarity of these 
patients) and the data on patients with various stages of renal or hepatic impairment is either absent or very 
limited. Therefore, this brings uncertainties to the safety of givosiran in these sub-populations and the data 
will need to be collected post-approval as part of the RMP, even though the safety profile of givosiran is 
expected to be similar across all age groups.  Due to the concerns over potential hepatic toxicity, the SmPC 
includes a warning related to the monitoring of serum transaminases and total bilirubin and dose modification 
in specific clinical situations.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Porphyria attacks are mostly very severe, with extreme pain and require hospitalisation or urgent health care 
visit. Hemin infusions used for treatment of attacks are a big burden for AHP patients as they carry the risk of 
morbidity, such as iron overload or infections due to the catheter lines. Therefore, the observed pronounced 
decrease in the attack rate and the reduction in need of hemin infusions following givosiran treatment are 
considered clinically meaningful and of high benefit for the patient.  
Adverse events were more frequently reported in the givosiran treatment group compared to placebo. Most 
of the adverse events were mild or moderate in severity and most of them resolved within the study 
duration. Only few AE led to the treatment discontinuation or dose interruption.  
Hepatic events are an important risk and may be a class effect of liver-targeting siRNA products. A warning 
and dose recommendations are provided in the SmPC to minimise these risks. The other main safety concern 
with givosiran use are renal events. It should be noted that AEs associated with renal events were usually 
reported in individuals with pre-existing renal conditions and this is emphasised in the product information 
which states that such patients may require careful monitoring of renal function during treatment.

3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The clinical efficacy of givosiran has been convincingly demonstrated in terms not only of a pharmacodynamic 
effect but more importantly by significantly reducing the frequency of severe porphyria attacks. This is 
expected to have a significant impact on the quality of life of affected patients.  
The overall safety profile of givosiran is considered acceptable and can be managed adequately by the 
proposed risk minimisation measures. Considering the nature of the disease and the lack of approved 
treatments, the demonstrated benefits of givosiran treatment outweigh the risks associated with its use. 
The long-term effect of treatment on safety in AHP patients will be further evaluated in the planned 
observational study. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Givlaari is positive.

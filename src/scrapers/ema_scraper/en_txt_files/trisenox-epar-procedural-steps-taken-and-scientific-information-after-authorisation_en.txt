1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Due to the genotoxic risk of arsenic compounds (see 
section 5.3), women of childbearing potential must use 
effective contraceptive measures during treatment with 
TRISENOX and for 6 months following completion of 
treatment. Men should use effective contraceptive 
measures and be advised to not father a child while 
receiving TRISENOX and for 3 months following completion 
of treatment. 
Arsenic is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential 
for serious adverse reactions in breast feeding infants and 
children from TRISENOX, breast-feeding must be 
discontinued prior to and throughout administration, and 
for two weeks after the last dose. 
For more information, please refer to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics.

CTI-1073, and a general revision of the information on 
pharmacokinetics in section 5.2 of the SPC for increased 
clarity. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to make some

minor editorial changes to the SPC and the Package Leaflet. 
Since only limited data are available across all hepatic 
impairment groups and across all renal impairment groups, 
caution is advised in the use of TRISENOX in patients with 
hepatic and/or renal impairment. The experience in 
patients with severe renal impairment is insufficient to 
determine if dose adjustment is required and the use of 
TRISENOX in patients on dialysis has not been studied.  
Similarly, the experience in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment is insufficient to determine if dose adjustment 
is required. 
Plasma clearance of AsIII was not altered in patients with 
mild renal impairment (creatinine clearance of 50-80 
mL/min) or moderate renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance of 30-49 mL/min).  The plasma clearance of AsIII 
in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance less than 30 mL/min) was 40% lower when 
compared with patients with normal renal function. 
Systemic exposure to MMAV and DMAV tended to be larger 
in patients with renal impairment; the clinical consequence 
of this is unknown but no increased toxicity was noted.  
Pharmacokinetic data from patients with hepatocellular 
carcinoma having mild to moderate hepatic impairment 
indicate that AsIII or AsV do not accumulate following 
twice-weekly infusions. No clear trend toward an increase 
in systemic exposure to AsIII, AsV, MMAV or DMAV was 
observed with decreasing level of hepatic function as 
assessed by dose-normalized (per mg dose) AUC.

Renewal of the marketing authorisation. 
14/12/2006

SmPC, Annex 
Based on the CHMP review of the available information and 
II, Labelling 
on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit/risk balance, 
and PL 
the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of this medicinal product continues to be 
adequately and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore 
considered that the benefit/risk profile of Trisenox 
continues to be favourable.  
In the absence of specific safety problems, given the 
stability of the population exposed to Trisenox, and the fact 
that section 4.8 of the SPC has been recently updated, the 
MAH can hereby change to a 3-year PSUR cycle. 
The CHMP recommends a renewal of the Marketing 
Authorisation for Trisenox under exceptional circumstances. 
The outstanding clinical data that will be generated by the 
ongoing studies, included as part of the Specific 
Obligations, will provide additional pharmacokinetic and/or 
efficacy information. There are therefore no specific safety/ 
pharmacovigilance concerns, which would require a further 
renewal. Therefore, the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
renewal can be granted with unlimited validity. 
During the renewal procedure, changes were made to the 
Product Information to bring it in line with the current 
EMEA/QRD template, SPC guideline and other relevant 
guideline(s), which were reviewed by QRD and accepted by 
the CHMP.

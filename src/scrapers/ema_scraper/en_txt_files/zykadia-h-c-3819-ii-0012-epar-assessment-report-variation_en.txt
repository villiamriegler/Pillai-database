Lung cancer has been among the most common cancers in the world for several decades. The 2012 
worldwide estimates of cancer incidence and mortality by GLOBOCAN, indicate a total of 1.8 million new lung 
cancer cases and 1.6 million lung cancer related deaths, accounting for 13.0% of all cancer cases (except 
non-melanoma skin cancers) and 19.4% of all cancer deaths (except non-melanoma skin cancers). 
Furthermore, lung cancer incidence rates were two-fold higher in males compared to females (1,241,601 
and 583,100, respectively). In 2013, the estimated number of lung cancer related deaths is 159,480 in the 
United States (Siegel et al 2013) and 269,610 in the European Union (Malvezzi et al, 2013).  
Assessment report  
EMA/386332/2017

The two most prevalent sub-types of lung cancer are small cell lung cancer and NSCLC. Approximately 85% 
of all lung cancers are NSCLC, which is frequently further subdivided into non-squamous carcinoma 
(including adenocarcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and other cell types) and squamous cell (epidermoid) 
carcinoma (Brambilla et al, 2014 and Schrump DS et al NSCLC; Principles and Practice of Oncology. 9th 
Edition. 2011). Recently, histology has emerged as a predictive factor for pemetrexed efficacy (Scagliotti G. 
et al 2011) and a determinant of toxicity with bevacizumab for patients with advanced NSCLC (Johnson DH. 
et al, 2004).  
For the majority of patients, NSCLC is diagnosed at an advanced stage with an overall poor prognosis. The 
overall survival (OS) for metastatic NSCLC is dismal with 5-year survival of <5% (Lindsey A. et al, 2016).  
In addition, over the past decade molecular subsets based on the presence of driver mutations have been 
identified. In particular, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations and anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK) gene rearrangements were the first molecular alterations shown to confer sensitivity to specific 
targeted therapies.  
According to the ESMO Clinical Practice Guidelines for metastatic NSCLC (Novello S. et al, 2016), in the 
absence of driver mutations first-line platinum-based doublet chemotherapy (four with a maximum of six 
cycles) is recommended in patients with good performance status, based on the observed prolonged survival 
and improved quality of life (QoL). A comparable efficacy has been observed with several regimens including 
cisplatin and carboplatin combinations with gemcitabine, paclitaxel and docetaxel (Schiller JH. et al, 2002). 
The addition of bevacizumab to platinum-based backbone regimen improved OS in non-squamous NSCLC 
patients with ECOG PS 0-1 (Sandler A. et al, 2006). Therefore, the combination of bevacizumab and 
platinum-based chemotherapy should be considered in eligible non-squamous NSCLC.  
In case of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene 
rearrangements, approved target therapy agents are available.  
Crizotinib has been authorised on 23 November 2015 for the first-line treatment of adults with ALK-positive 
advanced NSCLC. In the full analysis population of study 1014, the median PFS was 10.9 months for 
crizotinib and 7.0 months for chemotherapy. The HR comparing crizotinib with chemotherapy was 0.454 
(95% CI: 0.346, 0.596), with a p-value of <0.0001 (1-sided, based on a stratified log-rank test). 
About the product 
Ceritinib is a second-generation, orally, selective ALK-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), which inhibits 
auto-phosphorylation of ALK, ALK-mediated phosphorylation of downstream signalling proteins and 
proliferation of ALK-dependent cancer cells both in vitro and in vivo.  
The recommended dosage and schedule as single agent therapy in NSCLC is 750 mg once daily (21 days 
cycle). Treatment should continue as long as clinical benefit is observed. 
Ceritinib received conditional marketing authorisation in the EU on 6 May 2015 for the treatment of adult 
patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced NSCLC previously treated with crizotinib. 
This application for an extension of indication provides data from the randomised, open-label, multicentre, 
active-controlled Phase III study for the first-line treatment of ALK-positive patients with stage IIIb, or stage 
IV NSCLC (Study CLDK378A2301, referred to with abbreviated study code A2301). 
Based on the results from this single pivotal study, the MAH is submitted an application for an extension of 
the indication as follows: 
Zykadia is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase 
(ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
To support this application, the MAH submitted a 26–week chronic toxicity study conducted with ceritinib in 
rats and a 39-week chronic toxicity study conducted with ceritinib in Cynomolgus monkeys. 
2.2.2.  Toxicology 
Repeat dose toxicity 
26-week rat study with an 8-week recovery period - Study 1370208 (GLP) 
Administration of ceritinib was tolerated in rats when given daily by oral gavage for 26 weeks at doses up to 
20 mg/kg/day. Slightly lower mean body weights and lower weekly mean body weight change were noted in 
males given 20 mg/kg/day. Ceritinib-related haematology effects consisted of minimally lower haemoglobin 
concentration and haematocrit for females given 20 mg/kg/day due to minimally lower mean corpuscular 
volume and mean corpuscular haemoglobin. Ceritinib-related clinical chemistry effects included minimally 
lower albumin:globulin ratio for males given 10 or 20 mg/kg/day and females given 20 mg/kg/day. Mildly 
lower triglyceride concentration for males and minimally lower magnesium and inorganic phosphorus 
concentrations for females were observed at 20 mg/kg/day. 
As with previously conducted studies with ceritinib, microscopic findings were observed in the liver, 
duodenum, bile duct, lymph node, and lungs. Following an 8-week recovery phase, partial or full recovery 
was apparent for all findings in animals given 20 mg/kg/day. The no observed effect level (NOEL) was not 
attained because minimal changes in the bile duct and slight to minimal changes in the liver and lymph 
nodes were observed at the lowest dose (3 mg/kg/day). Corresponding Cmax and AUC0-24h values at 20 
mg/kg/day were 1290 ng/mL and 22400 ng.hr/mL, respectively, for males, and 1260 ng/mL and 21800 
ng.hr/mL, respectively, for females. These exposure values are similar to those observed clinically with 
ceritinib. 
39-week monkey study with an 8-week recovery period – Study 1370280 (GLP) 
Administration of ceritinib was well tolerated in cynomolgus monkeys as a daily gavage administration at 
dose levels up to 30 mg/kg/day for at least 39 weeks. Test article-related clinical findings were limited to 
excessive salivation at 30 mg/kg/day. In addition, mild (males) or moderate (females) reductions in body 
weight gain were observed at 30 mg/kg/day. Ceritinib-related effects on clinical pathology test results were 
limited to minimally to mildly increased ALT activity for animals given 30 mg/kg/day and minimally to mildly 
higher post-dose glucose concentrations, relative to controls, for animals given ≥10 mg/kg/day. Neither of 
these findings were considered adverse. A mechanism for this modest effect on post-dose glucose 
concentration was undetermined, but because animals were not fasted before sample collections, 
differences in relative timing of food consumption between groups and/or individuals may have impacted the 
results. Serum glucose concentration appeared unaffected at the end of the recovery phase, but it was only 
assessed once during the day. Insulin and haemoglobin A1C concentrations appeared unaffected by 
ceritinib. 
Ceritinib-related microscopic findings were present at doses ≥10 mg/kg/day. Changes were similar to those 
observed in the 13-week toxicity study and included minimal to moderate increased mixed cell infiltrates in 
the common and cystic (extra-hepatic) bile ducts (males only), minimal to slight infiltrates of macrophages 
and minimal increased mixed cell infiltrates in the major duodenal papilla, and minimal sinus histiocytosis in 
the mesenteric lymph node. Ceritinib-related histological changes along the biliary tree were restricted to 
extra-hepatic bile ducts. At the end of recovery, macrophage infiltrates in the major duodenal papilla and 
Assessment report  
EMA/386332/2017 
Page 9/101 
 
  
  
sinus histiocytosis in the mesenteric lymph node were noted but were of reduced incidence and severity, 
indicating partial recovery. Corresponding Cmax and AUC0-24h values at 30 mg/kg/day were 1350 ng/mL 
and 23,100 ng.hr/mL, respectively, for males, and 1340 ng/mL and 25,100 ng.hr/mL, respectively, for 
females, which are similar to the plasma exposures seen clinically. The no effect level in this study (NOEL) 
was considered to be 3 mg/kg/day, and the No Observable Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) was considered to 
be 30 mg/kg/day.  
2.2.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The refined Fpen has been recalculated based on prevalence of the disease (complete prevalence of 
ALK-positive NSCLC). The predicted environmental concentration (PEC) of ceritinib (0.034 µg/L) was above 
the trigger value for a Phase II Tier A assessment. 
Nevertheless, Phase II Tier A risk calculations based on available epidemiological data were performed and 
are presented below.

Groundwater assessment 
PECgroundwater = 8.5 ng/L 
PNECgroundwater = 41 µg/L 
PEC/PNECgroundwater = 0.0085 µg/L / 41 µg/L = 0.00021 
The risk ratios of the Phase II Tier A risk assessment based on predicted environmental concentrations 
calculated with epidemiology data remain significantly below a risk ratio of 1. 
2.2.4.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
Two new repeat-dose toxicology studies (26-week study in rat and 39-week study in monkey) have been 
submitted. Increased treatment duration did not change the toxicity profile of ceritinib. The toxicological 
findings in these studies were similar to what has already observed in the previous shorter repeat-dose 
toxicology studies. Therefore, there are no changes to the conclusions from the previous non-clinical safety 
evaluation and to the SmPC in section 5.3. 
According to the Q&A document on Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products 
for human use (EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010) the refined Fpen has been recalculated based on prevalence 
of the disease (complete prevalence of ALK-positive NSCLC). The predicted environmental concentration 
(PEC) of ceritinib (0.034 µg/L) was above the tigger value for a Phase II Tier A assessment. The results of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/386332/2017 
Page 10/101 
 
  
  
risk ratios of the Phase II Tier A risk bases on PEC calculated with prevalence data of the disease show that 
no risk for surface waters, microorganisms in sewage treatment plants and for groundwater is expected. 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of ceritinib. Considering the above data, ceritinib is not expected to pose a 
significant risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
This application is based primarily on a Phase III, open-label, randomised, active-controlled global study, 
CLDK378A2301 (ASCEND-4), for the first-line treatment of ALK positive advanced NSCLC patients.

dose of 750 mg in the PK run-in Phase; 750 mg once daily fasted in Phase II) in 
adult Chinese patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC previously treated 
with crizotinib and/or chemotherapy (maximum 2 lines of chemotherapy). All 
the patients received crizotinib as the last regimen prior to study entry, although 
this was not a mandatory criterion for patient inclusion. 
A Phase III, global, randomized open-label study of oral ceritinib (750 mg once

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Population PK 
A population PK analysis was performed to characterise the PK of ceritinib in ALK-positive cancer patients 
(NSCLC and non-NSCLC) and to investigate the effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the PK of ceritinib.  
The population PK analysis was performed with 9782 ceritinib concentration values from 973 patients 
(NSCLC and non-NSCLC) who were treated with at least one dose of ceritinib and had at least one post-dose 
PK sample from in the studies LDK378X2101, LDK378X1101, LDK378A2201, LD378A2203, LDK378A2109, 
LDK378A2301, and LDK378A2303. 
The treatment period began on Day 1 of Cycle 1. All patients were treated with ceritinib 750 mg administered 
orally on a once-daily dosing schedule under fasting conditions. Each treatment cycle was 21 days. The 
study consisted of trough PK sampling in all patients who received ceritinib treatment on Cycle 1 Day 1, 
Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 3 Day 1, Cycle 4 Day 1, Cycle 5 Day 1, and Cycle 6 Day 1. 
Table 1: PK parameter-covariate relationships included in full model development 
Methodology  
The population PK model was developed following 3 steps.  
• 
First, a base model consisting of structural, random effects, and residual error models was 
developed.  
•  Second, a full model was developed by incorporating covariate effects of intrinsic factors (body 
weight, ethnicity, and hepatic function) and extrinsic factors (concomitant medications with 
acid-reducing agents (ARAs)) on the structural model parameters.  
• 
Third, the final parsimonious model was obtained using stepwise backward elimination of 
covariate-parameter relationships.  
The population PK of ceritinib was described by a one-compartment model with delayed first order 
absorption and time-dependent elimination. An empirical exponential function was used to allow the 
apparent clearance to decrease asymptotically over time. 
The final population PK model was evaluated by a non-parametric bootstrap technique and a 
prediction-corrected visual predictive check (pcVPC). The effects of covariates on ceritinib systemic 
exposure at steady state (AUCss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss) were assessed using model-based simulation 
procedures. 
The final parameter estimates are given in Table 2.

Absorption 
Food-drug interactions (A2108) 
Study LDK378A2108 was a randomised, open-label cross-over study to evaluate the relative bioavailability 
of a new tablet formulation of ceritinib in comparison to the reference ceritinib capsule formulation (Cohort 
1) and to evaluate the effect of a light snack on the PK of ceritinib capsules (Cohort 3) in healthy subjects. 
Compared to the fasted state, a light snack (containing approximately 100-300 calories and 1.5 grams of 
fat) increased Cmax and AUCinf following a single 750 mg oral dose of ceritinib in healthy subjects by 45% and 
54%, respectively, in Study A2108 (Figure 9 and Table 3).

A2108 – PAS) 
The dosing recommendation for the pivotal study (A2301) was changed from fasting for at least 2 hours 
before and 2 hours after dosing to “at least two hours before and one hour after the dose is taken”.  
PK substudy of study A2301 
PK samples were collected in the phase III registration study A2301, which investigated efficacy and safety 
of ceritinib to standard first-line chemotherapy (platinum-based doublet with pemetrexed followed by 
pemetrexed maintenance in patients without progressive disease after 4 cycles) in adult patients with 
ALK-positive advanced NSCLC. 
The study consisted of trough PK sampling in all patients who received ceritinib treatment on Cycle 1 Day 1, 
Cycle 1 Day 15, Cycle 2 Day 1, Cycle 3 Day 1, Cycle 4 Day 1, Cycle 5 Day 1, and Cycle 6 Day 1. 
Thirteen (13) patients in the ceritinib arm were enrolled to participate in the extensive PK sampling group 
with serial blood sample collections on Cycle 1 Day 1 and Cycle 2 Day 1. Only 7 and 6 patients had evaluable 
full PK data collected after single dose (Cycle 1 Day 1) and at steady-state (Cycle 2 Day 1), respectively, and 
were included in the pharmacokinetic analysis set (PAS). 
Geometric and arithmetic mean trough concentration-time profiles for ceritinib at 750 mg/day are presented 
in Figure 10 and the temporal profiles of ceritinib trough concentrations in Figure 11. Geometric and 
arithmetic mean concentration at 750 mg for patients in the extensive ceritinib PK sampling group are 
presented in Table 4 and the time curve of the individual observations in Figure 12.

In the extensive PK sampling group, after the first dose, peak plasma levels (Cmax) of ceritinib were achieved 
approximately six hours after oral administration in these patients (Table 4). The geometric mean 
steady-state (at C2D1) Cmax (794 ng/mL) and AUC0-24h (16600 hr×ng/mL) were approximately 30% lower 
than that reported in the 750 mg dose group in LDK378X2101.

Moderate inter-patient and intra-patient variabilities were observed (inter-patient CV%: 55.4%; 
intra-patient CV%: 30.3%) using evaluable steady-state trough concentrations. 
Special populations 
Body weight 
Baseline body weight was evaluated in the population PK model and was identified as a significant covariate 
impacting ceritinib apparent oral clearance at steady-state (CL/Fss) and apparent volume of distribution 
(V/F). 
The steady-state AUCtau in patients with lower body weight (less than 60 kg) (26155 ng*h/mL [90% PI: 
24846-27484 ng*h/mL]) was estimated to be only 14% higher compared to the reference patients (22981 
ng*h/mL [90% PI: 22053- 23892 ng*h/mL]) with a body weight range of 60-80 kg (body weight cut-off 
values corresponded to the approximate 1st and 3rd quartiles of the body weight range in the study).  
The systemic exposure to ceritinib in patients with higher body weight (greater than 80 kg) (20101 ng*h/mL 
[90% PI: 18829-21480 ng*h/mL]) was estimated to be only 12% lower compared with reference patients. 
In a model-based simulation of exposure according to body weight as a continuous variable, the AUCss 
tended to decrease with increasing body weight. The AUCss at 40 kg (lower end of BW range encompassing 
90% patients) was 1.25-fold (90%PI: 0.45-3.26) and 0.87- fold (90%PI: 0.33-2.30) at 90 kg (higher end of 
body weight range encompassing 90% patients) compared to the AUCss at mean body weight 67 kg. 
Gender 
Gender had no statistically significant effect on the systemic exposures of ceritinib. 
Ethnicity 
Overall, the magnitude of exposure increase was considered to be modest in all Asian populations (including 
Chinese, Japanese, and Other Asian). No clinically meaningful difference in efficacy (ORR) and safety 
between these two populations were observed. 
Age 
Ceritinib PK was not affected by age (age range: 22 to 82 years) in the population PK analysis. 
Impaired renal function 
In the population PK analysis, the estimated steady-state ceritinib exposure was similar in patients with mild 
and moderate renal impairment and normal renal function. Patients with severe renal impairment were not 
included in the clinical trials. 
Impaired hepatic function 
In the population PK, the steady-state AUCtau of ceritinib in patients with mild hepatic impairment is 
estimated to be comparable to that in patients with normal liver function. Only one patient included in the 
population PK analysis had pre-existing moderate hepatic impairment and no patients had severe 
impairment.  A study in non-cancer patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment (mild, moderate, 
severe based on Child-Pugh classification) (Study A2110) and matched subjects with normal hepatic 
function is ongoing.

2.3.3.  PK/PD modelling 
Exposure-response analyses 
Exposure-response (E-R) analyses for efficacy and safety were conducted in ALK-positive metastatic NSCLC 
treatment naïve (including ALK inhibitor) patients.   
In these analyses, average ceritinib trough concentration (Ctrough_avg) was used as plasma PK exposure 
measure. This parameter is defined as the geometric mean of evaluable trough concentrations for each 
patient. 
The incidences and 95% CI for efficacy and safety parameters were analysed according to the average 
Ctrough values that were categorised in four ascending quartile (Q) ranges as follows: 
<Q1 
Q1-Q2   
Q2-Q3   
≥Q3 
119-683 ng/ml 
683-936 ng/ml 
936-1210 ng/ml   
1210-1825 ng/ml 
Results 
E-R efficacy 
A total of 116 patients from Study A2301 were included in these analyses, i.e. 39 patients in each quartile of 
Ctrough. Based on these analyses, high and clinically meaningful response rates (confirmed CR/PR per BIRC 
assessment) were observed across all Ctrough_avg quartiles, i.e. 79.5% (95 CI: 63.5, 90.7), 76.9% (60.7, 
88.9), 84.6% (69.5, 94.1), and 59.0% (42.1, 74.4) for the ascending four quartiles. 
The fitted curve based on the logistic regression model indicated a lack of relationship between tumour 
response vs. Ctrough_avg along with the 95% CI (Figure 13). The logistic regression analysis showed that with 
a 200 ng/mL increase in ceritinib Ctrough_avg, there was a 23% decrease in the odds of having a confirmed 
CR/PR (OR=0.77; 95% CI: 0.62, 0.94).  
Figure 13: Logistic regression of tumour response status (confirmed CR/PR per BIRC 
assessment) vs. Ctrough of ceritinib, overlaid with observed data (PK-efficacy analysis set) 
Cox regression analyses indicated a lack of association between exposure level and DOR or PFS. Overall 
survival data was not mature enough and no clear trend can be identified.

The estimated PFS rates (95% CI) at 15 months were 50.9% (33.8%, 65.7%), 68.5% (51.3%, 80.7%), 
60.3% (42.2%, 74.3%) and 35.7% (20.2%, 51.4%). 
Baseline brain metastasis was a statistically significant covariate for efficacy in both the logistic regression 
and the Cox regression models, indicating that patients without baseline brain metastasis tend to have 
better efficacy outcome in terms of response rate, DOR and PFS. The estimated odds ratio for ORR in the 
absence vs. presence of brain metastasis was 3.39 (95% CI: 1.50, 7.64). 
Table 5: Summary of ORR, PFS and baseline brain metastasis by quartile of average Ctrough of 
ceritinib (PK-efficacy analysis set) 
E-R safety 
Based on the pooled safety data, there were more newly occurring grade 2-4 transaminase elevations, and 
grade 2-4 hyperglycaemia in patients with higher ceritinib Ctrough values. However, no apparent association 
between ceritinib Ctrough_avg and total bilirubin elevations was observed. 
Logistic regression models suggested that with a 200 ng/mL increase in ceritinib Ctrough_avg, the risk of AST 
and ALT elevation increased by 28% (OR=1.28; 95% CI: 1.19, 1.38) and 37% (OR=1.37; 95% CI: 1.27, 
1.49), respectively, while the risk of grade 2-4 hyperglycaemia increased by 14% (OR=1.14; 95% CI: 1.04, 
1.24). 
Using a linear mixed effects model, increased exposures of ceritinib were shown to be associated with 
increased QTcP changes from baseline (Figure 14).

analysis set) 
Grade 3-4 AEs were observed in 71.6%, 69.2%, 73.9% and 84.6% of patients across the exposure quartiles, 
i.e. more patients in the highest quartile range experienced grade 3-4 AEs. The median times (95% CI) to 
first grade 3-4 AEs using Kaplan-Meier method by quartiles of Ctrough_avg were 2.2 months (1.4, 4.4), 5.4 
months (3.7, 7.4), 3.8 months (3.0, 5.3) and 2.7 months (1.9, 3.4), respectively.  
No apparent association was observed between ceritinib Ctrough_avg and grade 2-4 GI events. 
Exposure-dose adjustment relationship 
Increasing Ctrough levels were associated with higher frequency of dose reductions, i.e. 48.6%, 56.1%, 
61.0% and 72.6% of patients had dose reductions in the ascending four quartiles of Ctrough. 
A similar trend was observed for time to first dose interruption. Approximately 65%, 70%, 75% and 83% of 
patients had dose interruptions in the ascending four quartiles of Ctrough_avg.  
There was no clear association between increased exposures and permanent discontinuation of study drug 
as 81.2%, 77.6%, 72.2% and 71.9% of patients discontinued study drug in the ascending four quartiles. 
Across exposure ranges, median times (95% CI) to study drug discontinuation were as follows: 7.9 months 
(6.1, 11.0), 12.5 months (10.6, 17.4), 12.4 months (9.9, 15.2) and 12.9 months (9.9, 17.1) for the 
ascending four quartiles.  
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No new clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted, however some PK data in the new patient 
population have been collected as part of the pivotal trial (A2301). In addition a PK vs. efficacy and safety 
relationship analysis based on study A2301 only, and a population-PK analysis based on the pooled dataset 
from 7 clinical studies have been included in this submission.  
The submitted PK data are in general considered acceptable.  
Population-PK model 
A population-PK analysis has been performed using data from a new Phase III clinical trial (LDK378A2301) 
together with six clinical trials that were included in the initial Marketing Authorization Application 
submission. The modelling workflow is adequate and clearly justified.

Several covariates were selected regarding statistical and clinical criteria. The MAH concluded that none of 
the covariates had a clinically meaningful effect on the systemic exposure. The point estimate of the 90% 
prediction limit of the ethnicity effect (Japanese versus Caucasian population) is out of 1.25 limit, which 
indicates that at least part of Japanese population would have a clinically higher exposure with the 
recommended schedule (750 mg q.d.). This has been partially explained because of the reduced weight of 
the Japanese individuals and no ethnic differences were detected on ALT and AST levels, suggesting that 
liver enzymatic activity is unlikely to contribute to the increased exposure in Japanese patients relative to 
other ethnicity groups. 
Study 2108 investigated the effect of a light snack on the PK of ceritinib. Cmax and AUCinf were increased with 
a light snack compared to fasted state. The magnitude of increase was similar to that caused by a low-fat 
meal. Based on the observations in Studies A2108 and A2101, an increase in exposure would be expected 
when ceritinib is taken with food.  
The MAH proposed to change the fasting window in section 4.2 of the SmPC in line with the recommendation 
provided in the study protocols of pivotal study A2301 and study A2303 to indicate that “no food should be 
eaten for at least two hours before and one hour after the dose is taken”. However, no information on the 
precise food-effect when food is taken one hour after administration of ceritinib has been submitted and has 
been reflected in section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
Exposure-response efficacy analyses 
The E-R analyses indicated a lack of relationship between the increased exposure levels and efficacy 
endpoints of ORR, PFS and DOR. The logistic regression analysis showed that with a 200 ng/mL increase in 
ceritinib Ctrough_avg, there was a 23% decrease in the odds of having a confirmed CR/PR (OR=0.77; 95% CI: 
0.62, 0.94).  
The experimental trend observed between confirmed CR/PR per BIRC assessment is captured by the model. 
The logistic regression model included gender and baseline brain metastasis as covariates. Nevertheless, the 
model over-predicts the proportion of patients with tumour response along the range of average trough 
concentrations shown. The overall fit is adequate for the most representative group of individuals included 
in the study.  
Patients in the fourth Ctrough_avg quartile (i.e. the highest exposure level) appeared to have a lower response 
rate and a shorter PFS compared to the other quartiles. To better characterise the exposure-efficacy 
relationship, the applicant conducted an additional time-dependent cox regression analysis where the 
overall response was associated with its corresponding exposure within 2 cycles prior to each tumour 
assessment. Results of these analyses suggested lack of a relationship between PK exposure and overall 
tumour response, indicating that patients with the lowest and the highest exposure levels achieved similar 
response in terms of CR/PR. Although higher exposures to ceritinib do not seem to be associated with any 
detrimental effect based on the new exposure-response analysis, median times to dose reduction or 
interruption were shorter for patients in the upper exposure quartiles compared to the lowest quartile. 
Besides, the number of patients that needed dose reduction was 2-fold higher in the upper quartiles 
compared to the lowest quartile. However, as exposure-response analyses included only a limited data set 
of patients with Ctrough_average values and with at least one efficacy record (n=116), no firm conclusions can 
be drawn based on these results. 
Any particular imbalances in baseline demographics and disease characteristics between the 20 patients 
with baseline brain metastasis in the first and fourth quartiles who did not have a PFS event within 3 months 
was identified. A comparison could not be made for patients who had a PFS event < 3 months, as the number 
of patients with baseline brain metastasis was limited to one in the first quartile. For the 8 patients in the 
fourth quartile with PFS event < 3 months, no particular demographic or disease characteristics were 
identified that might have been associated with poor efficacy outcome. 
Assessment report  
EMA/386332/2017 
Page 28/101 
 
  
  
The E-R efficacy analysis results showed that patients without brain metastasis at baseline had a higher 
chance of responding, i.e. estimated odds ratio for ORR was 3.39 (95% CI: 1.50, 7.64). Based on the Cox 
regression model of DOR per BIRC assessment with C trough_avg, patients without brain metastasis at baseline 
were 57% less likely to progress/die after the initial response, compared with those with brain metastasis 
(HR=0.43; 95% CI: 0.23,  0.78). However, these data should be interpreted with caution due to limited 
number of patients in these analyses.  
Exposure-response safety analyses 
E-R safety analyses were based on pooled safety data from 7 clinical studies (Studies X1101, X2101, A2201, 
A2203, A2109, A2301 and A2303) in all ALK-positive NSCLC patients at all dose levels. Safety endpoints 
included all grade 3-4 AEs, hepatotoxicity, hyperglycaemia, gastrointestinal AEs, QTc interval prolongation, 
dose reduction, dose interruption and study drug discontinuation. 
These analyses showed a clear relationship between exposure level and increased frequency of AEs of 
ALT/AST elevations, hyperglycaemia and QTc prolongation.  
Higher exposures, particularly in the fourth quartile with average Ctrough levels of 1210-1825 ng/ml, 
appeared to be associated with earlier and more frequent grade 3-4 AEs. Furthermore, increasing Ctrough 
levels were associated with higher frequency of dose reductions, i.e. 48.6%, 56.1%, 61.0% and 72.6% in 
the ascending four quartiles. A similar trend was also observed for time to first dose interruption, i.e. ~ 65%, 
70%, 75% and 83% of patients had dose interruptions in the ascending four quartiles. The median time to 
dose reduction or interruption was also shorter for patients included in the fourth quartile. No clear 
association was found between high exposures and time to permanent discontinuation of ceritinib. 
Due to the poor tolerability of high exposures to ceritinib and markedly increased need for dose adjustments 
in the ascending quartiles of Ctrough in conjunction with the lack of an exposure-response relationship with 
efficacy in terms of all parameters investigated, the proposed initial dose of 750 mg can be questioned. The 
Applicant justified the proposed initial dose of 750 mg due to the high and stable response observed within 
the PK exposure studied. Although the initial dose of 750 mg could primarily be associated with the observed 
efficacy, the average dose based on the patient exposure data was 626 mg. Considering that approximately 
62% of the patients required dose reduction from 750 mg to 600 mg or lower doses, any favourable or 
unfavourable impact of the initial higher dose on the overall efficacy remains unknown.  
Exposure-QT analysis has been adequately assessed and the QTcP change has been reported for the 
mean/median but also for 25 and 75% percentiles (Cmax and Cmin). The maximal predicted change of QTcP 
from baseline was 22.4 (21.2; 23.6) (75% percentile of Cmax). These results are in line with previous findings 
on QT investigations as well as with data included in SmPC which suggested that ceritinib causes 
concentration-dependent increases in QTc. Having said that, the prediction on change from baseline QTcP 
were performed assuming the most frequent individual in the database: age 52 years, weight 65 kg, median 
baseline QTcP 414.4 ms, female, non-Caucasian, and baseline WHO status ≥1.  
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The new data provided do not impact the overall knowledge on PK/PD of ceritinib. However, the SmPC has 
been updated in section 4.2 and 5.2 in order to revise the fasting window for the administration of ceritinib.

[Study X2101]. 
Among the different doses tested, ceritinib 750 mg (highest dose evaluated) was determined as MTD/RD 
based on the number of DLTs, safety and clinical experience of individual patients observed during the first 
cycle of treatment [Study X2101]. 
Ceritinib 750 mg dose was used in the expansion phase of the Study X2101 and it is the RD for ceritinib in 
the ongoing Phase II and III studies. This dose of ceritinib is also the registered dose in the countries ceritinib 
obtained marketing authorisation. 
In Study A2301, ceritinib was administered orally, once-daily (fasted) at a planned dose of 750 mg.

Study participants 
Main inclusion criteria: 
•  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of non-squamous NSCLC that was ALK-positive as 
assessed by the Ventana IHC test. The test was performed at Novartis designated central 
laboratories. 
•  Newly diagnosed stage IIIB (and was not a candidate for definitive multimodality therapy) or had 
stage IV non-squamous NSCLC or relapsed locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC (per Protocol 
Amendment 1) not previously treated with any systemic anti -cancer therapy (e.g. cytotoxic drugs,

experimental or not), with the exception of neo-adjuvant or adjuvant therapy. 
• 
• 
Patients with at least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST 1.1. A previously irradiated site 
lesion was only counted as a target lesion if there was clear sign of progression since the irradiation. 
Patients who received previous neo-adjuvant or adjuvant systemic therapy were eligible for 
enrolment only if relapse had occurred more than 12 months from the end of the neoadjuvant or 
adjuvant systemic therapy. Patients who had recovered from all toxicities related to prior (neo-) 
adjuvant systemic therapy to grade ≤ 1 (CTCAE v 4.03). Exception to this criterion: patients with 
any grade of alopecia were allowed to enter the study. 
•  WHO performance status 0-2 
Main exclusion criteria 
•  History of interstitial lung disease or interstitial pneumonitis, including clinically significant radiation 
pneumonitis (i.e., affecting activities of daily living or requiring therapeutic intervention). 
• 
Patients with symptomatic CNS metastases who were neurologically unstable or had required 
increasing doses of steroids within the 2 weeks prior to screening to manage CNS symptoms. 
•  Received thoracic radiotherapy to lung fields ≤ 4 weeks prior to starting the study treatment or 
patients who had not recovered from radiotherapy-related toxicities. For all other anatomic sites 
(including radiotherapy to thoracic vertebrae and ribs) radiotherapy ≤ 2 weeks prior to starting the 
study treatment or had not recovered from radiotherapy -related toxicities. Palliative radiotherapy 
for bone lesions ≤ 2 weeks prior to starting study treatment was allowed.

practice). 
Objectives 
Primary objective 
- To compare the anti-tumour activity of ceritinib versus chemotherapy, as measured by PFS determined by 
a BIRC. 
Secondary objectives 
- To compare OS in patients treated with ceritinib versus chemotherapy. 
- To assess the anti-tumour activity of ceritinib versus chemotherapy, as measured by ORR, DOR, disease 
control rate (DCR), and time to response (TTR) determined by BIRC and by Investigators. 
- To assess the anti-tumour activity of ceritinib versus chemotherapy, as measured by PFS determined by 
Investigators. 
- To assess the anti-tumour activity of ceritinib versus chemotherapy in the brain, as measured by overall 
intracranial response rate (OIRR), IDCR and duration of intracranial response (DOIR) as determined by BIRC 
neuro-radiologist per modified RECIST 1.1 (as per Protocol Amendment 3). 
- To evaluate the safety profile of ceritinib versus chemotherapy. 
- To assess the effect of ceritinib versus chemotherapy on patient reported outcomes (PROs), including 
disease-related symptoms, functioning, and health-related quality of life. 
- To characterize the PK of ceritinib in this patient population. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint used to evaluate the anti-tumour activity of ceritinib versus chemotherapy was PFS, 
defined as the time from the date of randomisation to the date of the first radiologically documented disease 
progression per BIRC assessment or death due to any cause. 
Tumour evaluation was performed at baseline and then every six weeks (two cycles) after C1D1 through 
Month 33, and then every nine weeks (three cycles) thereafter and at EOT for response determination. 
Secondary endpoints 
• 
The key secondary endpoint, OS, was defined as the time from date of randomisation to date of 
death due to any cause. If the patient was alive at the date of the analysis cut-off or lost to follow-up, 
then OS was censored at the last contact date prior to data cut-off date. 
•  Overall response rate (ORR): The ORR was defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall 
response (BOR) of complete response (CR) or partial response (PR). 
•  Duration of response (DOR): Among patients with a confirmed response (PR or CR), DOR was 
defined as the time from first documented response (PR or CR) to the date of first documented PD 
or death due to any cause. If a patient did not have an event, DOR was censored at the date of last 
adequate tumour assessment. 
•  Disease control rate (DCR): defined as the proportion of patients with BOR of CR, PR, SD, or 
Non-CR/Non-PD per RECIST 1.1. 
Assessment report  
EMA/386332/2017 
Page 32/101 
 
  
  
• 
Time to response: The time to overall response of CR or PR (TTR), was defined as the time from the 
date of randomisation to the date of the first documented response (CR or PR, which was confirmed 
subsequently) for patients with confirmed CR or PR. 
•  Overall intracranial response rate (OIRR): The OIRR was calculated based on response assessments 
in the brain for patients having measurable or non-measurable BM at baseline. OIRR was defined as 
the ORR based on target and non-target lesions (and new lesions, if applicable) assessments in the 
brain and calculated as the proportion of patients with a best overall confirmed response of CR or PR 
in the brain per modified RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BIRC neuro-radiologist. 
• 
Intracranial disease response rate (IDCR): The IDCR was calculated based on response assessments 
in the brain for patients having measurable or non-measurable BM at baseline. IDCR was defined as 
the DCR based on target and non-target lesions (and new lesions, if applicable) assessments in the 
brain and calculated as the proportion of patients with a best overall confirmed response of CR or PR 
or a response of SD (or non-CR/non-PD) in the brain per modified RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BIRC 
neuro-radiologist. 
• 
Intracranial clinical benefit rate (ICBR): defined as the proportion of patients with a best overall 
response of CR or PR, or an overall lesion response of SD or Non -CR/Non-PD which lasts for a 
minimum time duration. This endpoint measures signs of activity taking into account duration of 
disease stabilization. ICBR was added as post-hoc analyses to be calculated at 12 weeks, 18 weeks 
and 24 weeks after randomisation among patients with measurable BM at baseline and separately in 
patients having measurable or non-measurable BM at baseline. 
•  Duration of intracranial response (DOIR): Among patients with a confirmed intracranial response 
(PR or CR), DOIR was defined as the DOR based on target, non-target lesion (and new lesion, if 
applicable) assessments in the brain and calculated from the time of first documented intracranial 
response (PR or CR) to the date of first documented intracranial PD or death due to any cause per 
modified RECIST 1.1 as assessed by BIRC neuro-radiologist. If a patient did not have an event, DOIR 
was censored at the date of last adequate intracranial tumour assessment. 
• 
Patient reported outcomes: The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer’ score 
QoL questionnaire (EORTC-QLQC30, version 3.0) and lung cancer specific questionnaire (QLQ LC13, 
version 1.0) were used to explore PRO measures of health-related QoL, functioning, disease 
symptoms and treatment-related side effects. The Lung Cancer Symptom Scale (LCSS) measured 
physical and functional dimensions for individuals with lung cancer. The EuroQOL five dimensions 
questionnaire (EQ-5D) is a standardized measure of health status, was used to provide a simple, 
generic measure of health for clinical and economic appraisal. 
Sample size 
In a randomized Phase III study in chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced-stage NSCLC, median PFS 
of approximately 7.7 months and median OS of approximately 16.5 months were observed in patients who 
received pemetrexed maintenance after induction with platinum-based chemotherapy (Ciuleanu 2009). In 
the randomised Phase III PARAMOUNT Study in chemotherapy-naive patients with advanced-stage NSCLC, 
median PFS of approximately 7 months was observed after treatment with pemetrexed/cisplatin followed by 
pemetrexed maintenance (Paz-Ares 2012). In the planned study, to be conservative, median PFS of 8 
months and median OS of 17 months were assumed for the control arm. 
Therefore, it was expected that treatment with ceritinib would result in a 38% reduction in the hazard rate 
(corresponding to an increase in median PFS from 8 months to 12.94 months under the exponential model 
assumption). If the true hazard ratio was 0.62 (under the alternative hypothesis), a total of approximately 
205 PFS events were required to have 90% power at a one-sided 2.5% level of significance to reject the null 
Assessment report

Page 33/101 
 
  
  
hypothesis (HR=1) using a log-rank test and a 2-look group sequential design. To be conservative, it was 
assumed that both futility and efficacy analyses were performed at the interim analysis. However, there was 
no plan to stop the study for efficacy at the interim analysis. Assuming a recruitment period of approximately 
24 months at an increasing rate during the first 6 months and stabilizing at a uniform rate of 15 
patient’s/month after the first 6 months, along with an assumed 15% dropout rate, approximately 348 
patients were needed to be randomised to the two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio. Given the above 
assumptions, it was estimated that the 205th PFS event would occur approximately 32 months from the date 
of first patient randomised in the study. 
Power for analysis of key secondary variables 
With 253 deaths, the study would have 80% cumulative power (unadjusted for the pre -testing, in the 
hierarchical procedure, of PFS) to detect a hazard ratio of 0.70 using a log-rank test and a 4-look Lan-De 
Mets group sequential design with O’Brien-Fleming type boundary at one sided 2.5% level of significance. If 
the median OS in the control arm was 17 months, a 30% reduction in hazard rate corresponded to an 
increase in median OS from 17 months to 24.3 months under the exponential model assumption.  
Randomisation 
Eligible patients were randomized via IRT to one of the treatment arms. Randomisation was stratified by 
factors including WHO PS (0 vs 1-2), presence or absence of BM, and with or without previous neo- or 
adjuvant chemotherapy. 
Blinding (masking) 
Study A2301 was an open label study. 
Statistical methods 
Statistical hypothesis, model, and method of analysis 
The primary efficacy analysis was performed on the FAS according to the treatment arm and randomisation 
strata (WHO performance status: 0 vs. 1-2; presence or absence of BM, presence or absence of previous 
neo-/adjuvant chemotherapy) to which patients were assigned at randomisation. 
The distribution of PFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The median PFS along with 95% CI 
was presented by treatment arm using the method of Brookmeyer &Crowley (1982). The Kaplan-Meier 
curves were displayed by treatment arm. The number of patients at risk at certain time points was shown on 
the plots. 
PFS was tested using the stratified log-rank test (stratified according to randomisation stratification factors). 
The statistical basis for a claim of efficacy was the statistical significance (at the 2.5% one-sided level of 
significance) for PFS in favour of the ceritinib arm. 
Kaplan-Meier estimates with 2-sided 95% CIs at specific time points (including at least 3, 6,12, 18 and 24 
months) was summarised. The CIs were constructed using Greenwood’s formula (Collett 1994) for the 
standard error of the Kaplan-Meier estimate. 
A Cox regression model stratified by randomisation stratification factors was used to estimate the hazard 
ratio of PFS, along with 95% CI based on the Wald test. 
Handling of missing values/censoring/discontinuations 
PFS was censored at the date of the last adequate tumour assessment before an event or censoring reason 
occurred. Clinical deterioration was not considered as a qualifying event for progression. Patients without 
Assessment report

Page 34/101 
 
  
  
baseline tumour assessment who died within 14 weeks from randomisation date were counted as having an 
event in the primary analysis of PFS. 
The PFS censoring reasons included ongoing without event, lost to follow-up, withdrew consent, adequate 
assessment no longer available, new cancer therapy received prior to an event, event after >=2 missing 
tumour assessments. 
Analysis of secondary variables 
A hierarchical testing strategy, where OS was to be statistically evaluated and interpreted only if PFS was 
significantly different between treatment groups, was to be used to control the overall type-I error rate. 
The distribution function of OS was to be estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. The two treatment 
groups were to be compared using a stratified log-rank test at an overall onesided2.5% level of significance. 
A stratified Cox regression was to be used to estimate the OS hazard ratio and the associated 95% CI. 
OS was analysed based on the data from FAS, according to the treatment arm to which patients were 
randomised and the strata they were assigned at randomisation. 
Interim analysis 
Interim analysis for PFS: One interim analysis was planned to be performed when approximately 72 (35% of 
the 205) PFS events were documented by BIRC. The primary intent of the interim analysis was to stop early 
for lack of efficacy (futility). Approximately 203 patients were expected to be randomised at the time of the 
interim analysis. At the cut-off date of 23-Mar-2015 for interim analysis, 85 PFS events (41.4% information 
fraction) were observed. Upon data monitoring committee (DMC) recommendation, the decision was to 
continue the study without modification. 
Interim analysis for OS: A maximum of four analyses were planned for OS: 1) an interim analysis at the time 
of the interim analyses for PFS (provided PFS is significant); 2) an interim analysis at the projected time of 
the final analysis for PFS (provided PFS is significant); 3) if OS is not significant at the time of final analysis 
for PFS, provided PFS is significant, the third interim analysis for OS will be conducted when approximately 
215 deaths are observed and 4) If OS is not significant at third interim analysis, the final analysis for OS will 
be conducted when 253 deaths are observed. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Overall, 425 patients signed the main study informed consent, among whom 49 (11.5%) patients 
discontinued from Screening phase without getting randomised. Of the 49 patients who discontinued, 45 
patients failed screening assessment, one patient died, and three patients were not randomised due to the 
patient/guardian decision. A total of 376 patients completed the Screening phase and were randomised to 
either ceritinib or chemotherapy arm in the treatment phase.

Recruitment 
The study is being conducted in 134 sites that randomised at least one patient across 27 countries excluding 
the US. The study was initiated on 09 July 2013 (first patient first visit) and completed enrolment on 1 April 
2015 (last patient first visit). Between 19 August 2013 and 11 May 2015, a total of 376 patients with 
ALK-positive advanced non-squamous NSCLC who were previously untreated with systemic therapy (with 
the exception of adjuvant or neo adjuvant therapy if relapse had occurred at least 12 months after the end 
of therapy), were randomised to either ceritinib (n=189) or chemotherapy (n=187). 
The data cut-off date for this primary analysis was 24 June 2016, when 202 PFS events had been

EMA/386332/2017 
Page 36/101 
 
  
  
 
 
documented as per BIRC assessment and 218 PFS events per Investigator assessment were documented. 
The analyses are presented using data locked on 11 September 2016. The study is ongoing. The median 
duration between randomisation and data cut-off date for all patients was 19.7 months. 
Conduct of the study 
The study protocol was amended three times. 
Amendment 1 (27 August 2013): The most relevant change in the protocol was to limit the study population 
to stage IIIB patients who were not candidates for definitive multimodality therapy or stage IV, 
non-squamous NSCLC harbouring a confirmed ALK rearrangement. 
Amendment 2 (29 May 2015): This amendment allowed radiotherapy and surgical resection as local 
palliative therapy of metastases for patients who developed progressive disease but were still deriving 
clinical benefit from ceritinib therapy as determined by the Investigator. 
Amendment 3 (11 December 2015): This amendment provided follow up evaluations for hepatic toxicities 
and work-up guidelines for potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) cases in order to optimize the patient 
safety, and clarified sections of the protocol where additional guidance was required. The secondary 
objectives and related endpoints were updated to include assessment of the anti-tumour activity of ceritinib 
versus chemotherapy in the brain, as measured by OIRR, IDCR and DOIR, as assessed by BIRC 
neuro-radiologist per modified RECIST 1.1 to allow selecting up to five measurable brain lesions as target 
lesions

Protocol deviations 
At least one protocol deviation was reported in 110 patients (58.2%) in the ceritinib arm and 103 patients 
(55.1%) in the chemotherapy arm. 
The most frequently reported protocol deviations were due to treatment related deviation (39.2% patients 
in ceritinib arm and 37.4% of patients in chemotherapy arm). 
Protocol deviations that led to exclusion from PPS set were infrequent with no imbalance evident across the 
two treatment arms. Two patients (1.1%) in the chemotherapy arm had protocol deviations leading to 
exclusion from the PPS; both these patients received prior neo-/adjuvant therapy and had a relapse <12 
months from the end of neo -/adjuvant therapy. No patient in the ceritinib arm had protocol deviation that 
led to exclusion from the PPS.

Numbers analysed 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consisted of all patients to whom study treatment had been assigned by 
randomisation. According to the intent to treat principle, patients were analysed according to the treatment 
and strata to which they had been assigned during the randomisation procedure. 
The Safety Set consisted of all patients who received at least one dose of study drug (ceritinib or pemetrexed 
or carboplatin or cisplatin). Patients were analysed according to the study treatment they received. Patients 
were classified according to treatment received, where treatment received was defined as (i) the intended 
treatment if it was received at least once, or (ii) the first treatment received when starting therapy with 
study medication if intended treatment was never received. Each patient was classified into and analysed 
consistently within one (and only one) treatment arm. 
The Per-Protocol Set (PPS) consisted of a subset of patients in the FAS who had an adequate tumour 
assessment by the Investigator at baseline, a follow-up tumour assessment by the Investigator >5 weeks 
after starting treatment (unless disease progression was observed by the Investigator or death was 
observed, within 7 weeks), who received study drug only from the treatment arm they were randomized to 
prior to cross-over and had no protocol deviations that led to exclusion from PPS. 
The Crossover Analysis Set consisted of patients randomized to the chemotherapy arm, and who crossed 
over to receive at least one dose of ceritinib. This analysis set was used for all safety evaluations collected 
after patients crossed over into the extension treatment phase. 
A total of 376 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the ceritinib arm (n=189) or chemotherapy arm 
(platinum-based doublet with pemetrexed followed by pemetrexed maintenance in patients without 
progressive disease after the first 4 cycles; n=187) and were included in the FAS. All efficacy analyses are

based on the FAS, unless specified otherwise. All 189 patients randomised to the ceritinib arm were treated 
whereas only 175 patients among the 187 patients randomised to chemotherapy were treated. Among the 
187 patients randomized to chemotherapy: 87 patients started treatment with pemetrexed and cisplatin and 
88 patients started treatment with pemetrexed and carboplatin and 12 patients were not treated (seven due 
to patient/guardian decision, two due to AEs, two due to physician’s decision and one due to death). Further, 
127 patients continued treatment with pemetrexed maintenance in the chemotherapy arm. 
A total of 85 patients entered the extension treatment phase, among these 80 patients received at least one 
dose of ceritinib and were included in the cross-over analysis set (three patients did not receive ceritinib as 
of the data cut-off date and other two patients had died before start of first dose of ceritinib).

Supportive and sensitivity analyses of PFS by BIRC assessment 
The results of the PFS analysis using the PPS were consistent with that of the primary analysis based on the 
FAS. The results yielded a HR of 0.56 (95% CI: 0.42, 0.75; p<0.001); the median PFS as assessed by BIRC 
(95% CI) was 16.6 months (95% CI: 12.6, 27.2) and 8.1 months (95% CI: 5.8, 11.1) for the ceritinib arm 
and chemotherapy arm, respectively. 
The following baseline covariates were included in a stratified multivariate Cox proportional hazard 
regression model for PFS assessed by BIRC: stage of disease, geographic region, age, race and gender. The 
treatment effect hazard ratio (HR=0.50, 95% CI: 0.37, 0.66) after adjusting for the baseline covariates was 
similar to the stratified Cox regression model hazard ratio from the primary PFS analysis.

Key secondary efficacy results - OS 
As pre-specified in both the protocol and statistical analysis plan, statistical testing was performed on OS, 
based on a hierarchical testing procedure adopted for the study, as the primary efficacy endpoint PFS by 
BIRC assessment was statistically significant favouring the ceritinib arm. This is the second interim analysis 
OS. 
The study did not cross the efficacy stopping boundary for OS at this second interim analysis. Testing was 
performed at a one-sided 0.0006 level of significance and the boundary was determined as per the 
predefined hierarchical testing procedure based on the planned 4-look Lan-DeMets group sequential design 
with O’Brien-Fleming type boundary.

Table 16: Summary of reasons for censoring patients in OS analysis by treatment arm (Full 
analysis set) 
The results of the OS analysis based on the PPS were similar to those assessed on the FAS (HR=0.81 with 
95% CI: 0.55, 1.20; p=0.144) using stratified Cox model. 
The following baseline covariates were included in a stratified multivariate Cox regression model for OS: 
stage of disease, geographic region, age, race, and gender. The treatment effect on the hazard ratio 
(HR=0.68, 95% CI: 0.46, 1.00) after adjusting for these baseline covariates was comparable to the 
stratified Cox regression model hazard ratio from the primary OS analysis. 
Of note, at the time of interim analysis for OS, a total of 109 out of 175 patients treated in the chemotherapy 
arm received subsequent anti-neoplastic medication after discontinuation of chemotherapy. Of the 175 
treated chemotherapy arm treated patients, 105 (60.0%) received a subsequent ALK-inhibitor as first 
treatment after discontinuation of chemotherapy including the 80 patients who received ceritinib in the 
extension treatment phase as per protocol. The additional 25 patients who did not cross-over received an 
ALK inhibitor as first treatment after discontinuation of chemotherapy. These ALK inhibitors received 
included crizotinib (23 patients), alectinib (one patient), and ceritinib (one patient). In addition, four 
patients received other chemotherapy as first treatment after discontinuation of study treatment with 
chemotherapy.  
A sensitivity analysis using rank-preserving structural failure time (RPSFT) was performed to correct for 
confounding introduced by the change of treatment when patients crossed-over from chemotherapy arm to

ceritinib arm. After adjustment for cross-over with the RPSFT model, the HR estimate from the RPSFT 
analysis was similar to the one from the primary OS analysis (HR=0.73; 95% CI: 0.49, 1.10). However the 
data was immature at the time of this primary analysis. 
PFS by Investigator assessment (secondary endpoint) 
Figure 17: Kaplan-Meier plot of progression-free survival per Investigator assessment by 
treatment arm (FAS) 
As of the data cut-off date, the median follow-up time for PFS by Investigator assessment was 13.7 months 
(range: 0 to 33.6 months) for the ceritinib arm and 5.6 months (range: 0 to 28.4months) for the 
chemotherapy arm 
Hazard ratio for patients in different stratifications were as follows: patients with BM (HR=0.66; 95% CI: 
0.41, 1.05); patients without BM (HR=0.42; 95% CI: 0.30, 0.59); WHO status 0 (HR=0.51; 95% CI: 0.32, 
0.80),WHO status 1-2 (HR=0.48; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.67), patients with prior adjuvant chemotherapy 
(HR=0.34; 95% CI: 0.03, 3.85) and patients without prior adjuvant chemotherapy (HR=0.49;95% CI: 0.37, 
0.65). 
The results of the PFS analysis by Investigator assessment using the PPS were consistent with those of the 
PFS analysis based on the FAS. The results yielded a HR of 0.50 (95% CI: 0.38, 0.65; p<0.001 one-sided, 
stratified log-rank test); the median PFS as assessed by Investigator assessment (95% CI) was 16.8 months 
(95% CI: 13.5, 25.2) and 7.2 months (95% CI: 5.8, 9.7) for the ceritinib arm and the chemotherapy arm, 
respectively. 
High concordance rates in the assessment of PFS event type between BIRC and Investigator review was 
observed with 88.4% for the ceritinib arm and 86.6% for the chemotherapy arm.

Duration of response 
Among patients with a confirmed CR or PR, the median DOR per BIRC assessment was longer in patients 
treated with ceritinib (23.9 months; 95% CI: 16.6, NE) compared to patients treated with chemotherapy 
(11.1 months; 95% CI: 7.8, 16.4).

(FAS – Patients with confirmed CR or PR) 
Time to response 
Among patients with confirmed CR/PR, 124/137 (90.5%) patients achieved the first documented response 
during the first 12 weeks on treatment with ceritinib compared to 16/50(32%) patients treated with 
chemotherapy. The median time to first response for patients with confirmed CR or PR was 6.1 weeks 
(range: 5.1 to 61.7 weeks) in the ceritinib arm and 13.4 weeks (range: 5.1 to 90.1 weeks) in the 
chemotherapy arm. 
Intracranial response 
Of the 121 patients (61 patients in the ceritinib arm and 60 patients in the chemotherapy arm) who had 
measurable or non-measurable brain metastases at baseline as per BIRC neuro-radiologist review, 106 
patients had at least one post-baseline assessment allowing the evaluation of the response to the study 
treatment. The proportion of patients with five or more number of brain lesions was 19/61 (31.1%) and was 
15/60 (25.0%) in the ceritinib and chemotherapy arm respectively. Fifty-five of 121 patients had 
measurable disease in the brain at baseline, among whom 44 patients had measurable lesions and who had 
a baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment (22 patients each in the ceritinib arm and the 
chemotherapy arm). Of the 121 patients with brain metastasis, 24/61 patients in the ceritinib arm and 24/60 
patients in the chemotherapy arm had received prior radiation therapy to brain, 22/24 patients in the 
ceritinib arm and 21/24 patients in the chemotherapy arm had radiation to the brain within 3 months prior 
to randomization.

Patient reported outcomes 
The compliance of patients completing the quality of life questionnaires was high with ≥ 80% of the patients 
in the ceritinib and chemotherapy arm completing the LCSS, EORTC QLQ C30, EORTC QLQ-LC13, and 
EQ-5D, questionnaires at most of the time points during the course of the study. 
Improvements were reported for the majority of lung cancer specific symptoms in the ceritinib arm 
compared to the chemotherapy arm. 
Specifically, time to deterioration for the composite endpoint of cough, pain and dyspnoea was prolonged in 
the LCSS (NE months vs 18.4 months, HR=0.61; 95% CI: 0.41, 0.90) and QLQ-LC13 (23.6 months vs 12.6 
months, HR=0.48, 95% CI: 0.34, 0.69) instruments for ceritinib versus chemotherapy. 
The probability of patients not having a definitive deterioration for the LCSS composite endpoint in the 
ceritinib arm at 24 months was 55.3% (95% CI: 43.6, 65.5) compared to 25.9% (95% CI: 6.8, 50.8) in the 
chemotherapy arm. The probability of patients not having a definitive deterioration for the QLQ-LC13 
composite endpoint at 18 months was 60.8% (95% CI: 51.8, 68.7) compared to 34.4% (95% CI: 23.4, 
45.7) for the ceritinib arm and chemotherapy arm respectively. 
Four out of six LCSS symptom scales (pain, cough, shortness of breath and fatigues), LCSS total score, 
average symptom burden index, normal activity status, total symptom distress and overall quality of life 
were improved in the ceritinib arm compared to the chemotherapy arm. The symptom scales for appetite 
loss and haemoptysis showed no change in the ceritinib arm compared to chemotherapy. 
Eight out of ten QLQ-LC13 scales (including the three item overall dyspnoea scale) showed improvements in 
the ceritinib arm compared to the chemotherapy arm. Improvements in the two scores for pain in arm or 
shoulder and haemoptysis were not significant. 
The QLQ-C30 questionnaire on general cancer symptoms showed improvements in four (physical 
functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning and role functioning) out of five functional scales and 
six (fatigue, pain, dyspnoea, insomnia, constipation and financial difficulties) out of nine individual scales. 
Patients receiving ceritinib achieved less favourable outcomes than those on chemotherapy for diarrhoea as

well as for nausea and vomiting scales, however no deterioration in the overall Quality of Life for patients 
was observed despite the longer exposure to ceritinib. In addition, improvements were demonstrated for 
ceritinib versus chemotherapy with improvements in most symptom scores, functional domains and for 
Global Health Status / QoL in the same instrument.

PFS in patients who continued to receive pemetrexed in maintenance 
Out of the 376 patients with ALK-positive advanced non-squamous NSCLC who were included in Study 
A2301, 187 were randomized to the chemotherapy arm to receive pemetrexed-based platinum doublet 
therapy. Eighty-seven (87) patients started treatment with pemetrexed and cisplatin, 88 patients started 
treatment with pemetrexed and carboplatin. Twelve (12) patients were not treated (seven due to 
patient/guardian decision, two due to AEs, two due to physician’s decision and one due to death). One 
hundred and twenty seven (127) patients entered the pemetrexed maintenance phase after induction 
therapy. Forty-eight (48) patients did not qualify for pemetrexed maintenance therapy at the end of the 4 
cycles of induction. The primary reason for treatment discontinuation in these 48 patients was progressive 
disease in 25 (52.1%), physician decision in 8 (16.7%), subject guardian decision in 7 (14.6%) patients, 
deaths in 5 (10.4%) patients and AEs in 3 (6.25%) patients.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The MAH is seeking a new indication for the first-line treatment of adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For that purpose, a Phase III, 
open-label, randomized, active-controlled global study, CLDK378A2301 (ASCEND-4), for the first-line 
treatment of ALK positive advanced NSCLC patients, has been submitted. 
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either ceritinib (750 mg once daily fasted) or 
chemotherapy (pemetrexed [500 mg/m2] plus cisplatin [75 mg/m2] or carboplatin [AUC 5-6 iv q 21 days) in 
the Treatment Phase. Patients who completed 4 cycles of treatment (induction) without progressive disease 
subsequently received pemetrexed as single-agent (maintenance 500 mg/m2) every 21 day. Patients in the 
chemotherapy arm were allowed to cross-over and receive ceritinib after BIRC-confirmed disease 
progression. Patients in either arm were allowed to continue the assigned study treatment beyond 
BIRC-confirmed disease progression in case of continued clinical benefit as per the Investigator. 
Patients included in Study A2301 presented with locally advanced (not candidates for definitive 
multimodality therapy) or metastatic ALK-positive non-squamous NSCLC not previously treated with any 
systemic anti-cancer therapy for advanced disease. Patients who were previously treated with neo-adjuvant 
or adjuvant systemic therapy were eligible for enrolment only if relapse occurred more than 12 months from 
the end of the adjuvant or neo adjuvant systemic therapy. 
This population seems to represent a first line ALK positive NSCLC. Of note, patients with symptomatic CNS 
metastases who were neurologically unstable or had required increasing doses of steroids within the 2 weeks 
prior to screening to manage CNS symptoms, were excluded from the study and reflected in section 5.1 of 
the SmPC. 
Treatments administered in the control arm could be considered, from a regulatory point of view, as the SoC 
at the time of the first patient was recruited (July 2013) since crizotinib received a positive opinion for 
previously treated patients in July 2012. On 22 October 2015, the CHMP recommended the use of crizotinib 
in first line setting. Doses of chemotherapy, the possibility of choosing between cisplatin or carboplatin and 
maintenance option for those patients with at least SD after induction (4 cycles), reflected the clinical 
practice at that time.  
Baseline characteristics are evenly balanced. The median age of the population recruited was 54 years, with 
a vast majority in WHO PS 0-1 (93%). Approximately, half of the population was Caucasian and 42% Asian. 
Never smoked patients represent 61% of the patients randomised, which is characteristic of ALK positive 
patients. Regarding the histology, adenocarcima, as expected, is the most frequent histology type in the 
study. 
The primary objective was to compare the anti-tumour activity of ceritinib versus chemotherapy, as 
measured by PFS determined by a BIRC. Therefore, the primary endpoint was PFS per BIRC, which is 
acceptable in first line of NSCLC within the context of an open-label design. The cross-over was allowed from 
chemotherapy to ceritinib arm after BIRC-confirmed disease progression. The latter, from an ethical 
perspective is totally acceptable, even though from a methodological point of view will have an impact on the 
interpretability of the key secondary endpoint, OS. 
The rest of secondary endpoints and exploratory variables appear adequate. Of note, the MAH did not follow 
the national scientific advice from AEMPS (March 2013) and MPA (April 2013) with respect to using PFS2 as 
an endpoint as recommended in the CHMP guideline. This is unfortunate as PFS2 results would have been of 
great interest, in order to evaluate the impact of ceritinib on next line therapies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/386332/2017 
Page 58/101 
 
  
  
Sample size calculations and statistical methods are in principle agreeable, especially the fact that the study 
is powered to detect a hazard ratio of 0.70 in OS. The analysis of efficacy variables and the several sensitivity 
analyses pre-specified into the protocol will provide robustness to the main analysis. 
The randomisation process, via IRT, and the stratification factors (WHO PS, BM and neo/adjuvant chemo) 
are deemed appropriated.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
All patients randomised in ceritinib arm were treated but there were 12 subjects in the chemo group who 
were randomised but untreated. More patients discontinued in chemotherapy arm than in ceritinib group 
during the treatment phase, being the main reason disease progression. Among the 85 patients (in the 
chemo arm) who entered the extension treatment phase, 80 had received a dose of ceritinib by the cut-off 
date in the extension treatment phase. At the time of the data cut -off, 33/85 patients in the extension 
treatment phase were still ongoing. In addition, 95 (50.3%) patients in the ceritinib arm and 30 (16.0%) in 
the chemotherapy arm were still on study treatment in the treatment phase. 
Patients treated with ceritinib in first line of ALK+ NSCLC obtain a gain of 8 months in terms of median PFS 
(from 8 months to 16 months) with a HR of 0.55. From an efficacy point of view, the outcomes clearly point 
out the benefit of ceritinib over chemotherapy. The percentage of events is 47% and 60% in ceritinib and 
chemotherapy arms respectively. Reasons for censoring are mainly due to absence of event and initiation of 
new anticancer therapy, the former higher for ceritinib and the latter more frequently reported for 
chemotherapy. These results in terms of PFS seem robust enough as several sensitive analyses (including 
the PPS) do not show important dissimilar outcomes, and subgroup analyses results were supportive.  
The investigator’s assessment of PFS offers a similar result to the primary analysis based on BIRC. The delay 
in the tumor progression observed in the PFS results (79 events out of 89 were progression) seems to be a 
direct consequence of the antitumor activity, since the ORR associated to ceritinib (72.5%) are almost all 
due to PR, with only 1 CR and 20 patients with SD. On the contrary, SD was the most frequent (42.2%) 
response in the chemotherapy arm. The response rate offered by ceritinib seems durable, seeing as the 
median of the duration of the response was 23.9 months (vs. 11 months in chemo group) even though these 
data are not mature enough. 
This superiority in progression free survival could be translated into a longer survival for patients treated 
with ceritinib in first line, however, despite the positive trend observed in the interim analysis OS (HR 0.73 
95% CI: 0.50, 1.08;p=0.056), did not reach statistical significance at the pre-specified one-sided 
significance level of 0.0006. The final OS results could not show significant differences due to the cross-over 
from ceritinib and the use of subsequent anti-neoplastic medication (109 out of 175 patients) with 60% of 
patients in the chemotherapy arm treated with ALK inhibitors after progression (crizotinib in 23 patients). 
In the subgroup of patients with brain metastases, ceritinib is showing a valuable OIRR, superior to 
chemotherapy. The same trend was seen in those patients with and without prior radiotherapy. Despite the 
exploratory nature of these analyses, the intracranial activity of ceritinib is deemed promising. 
Unfortunately, the efficacy of ceritinib to delay the onset of brain metastases was not investigated in study 
A2301, as only patients with identified brain lesions at baseline had subsequent scheduled brain 
assessment. However, according the MAH, the long median PFS (exceeding 2 years) in the subgroup of 
patients without brain lesions at baseline indicate that ceritinib may have delayed early or symptomatic 
brain progression. Considering that delaying the onset of brain metastases was not investigated in study 
A2301, it is considered impossible to draw any conclusion as regards whether ceritinib may delay the onset 
of brain metastases or not. 
PROs questionnaires were completed by 80% of patients, overall in the majority of the time-points of the 
trial (Day 1 of each cycle). Results highlighted an improvement in overall health status over chemotherapy.  
Assessment report  
EMA/386332/2017 
Page 59/101 
 
  
  
The results indicated significant improvements in lung cancer specific symptoms shown by significant 
improvements in most individual symptom scales and delay in time to deterioration of LCSS/QLQ-LC13 
composite scores for patients receiving ceritinib versus chemotherapy. The QLQ-C30 showed improvements 
in four out of five functional scales and in six out of nine individual scales. Furthermore, ceritinib showed 
improvements versus chemotherapy in overall quality of life (LCSS), Global Health status/quality of life 
(QLQ-C30) and in the EQ-5D index and Visual analogue score (VAS) scores. These results demonstrate an 
overall health status benefit. However, due to the open-label design, and exploratory nature of these 
analyses, these results should be interpreted with caution. 
The landscape of frontline ALK positive setting is characterised by the use of crizotinib. In study 1014, 
crizotinib significantly prolonged progression-free survival (PFS), the primary objective of the study, 
compared to chemotherapy (without maintenance) as assessed by IRR (HR 0.45 95%CI 0.35, 0.60; Median 
PFS 10.9 vs 7.0 crizotinib and chemotherapy respectively). ORR was 74% for crizotinib vs 45% in the 
chemotherapy arm. OS data were not mature enough, but a positive trend was shown (HR=0.82; 95%CI 
0.54, 1.26). So, taking into consideration the results offered by ceritinib and despite the bias associated to 
indirect comparison, ceritinib does not seem inferior to crizotinib, which is reassuring.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Ceritinib has shown a clinically meaningful gain in PFS over chemotherapy in the first line of ALK positive 
NSCLC. This improvement in the primary endpoint seems robust and supported by the secondary endpoint 
endpoints. Comparing the study results from both products in the first line treatment of patients with ALK 
positive NSCLC, it appears that ceritinib does not have a lower efficacy than that observed for crizotinib in a 
similar clinical setting. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety review is based primarily on the results of the Phase III Study A2301. At the time of the data 
cut-off date of 24 June 2016, the median duration of follow-up between the date of randomization to the 
cut-off date for all patients was 19.7 months.  
Comprehensive safety assessment of ceritinib is also provided from the pooled dataset (N=925) that 
consists of all available safety data from the Study A2301 (excluding the safety data from the 
extension-treatment phase) and six other Novartis-sponsored studies that had completed enrolment at the

Dose reductions and interruptions 
Study A2301 
Dose interruptions: The proportion of patients requiring at least one dose interruption was 78.3% for 
ceritinib in study A2301. Dose interruption for ceritinib occurred over the treatment period, with the highest 
percentage of dose interruption occurring between weeks 3 to 6 of treatment (24.9%), followed by 12.2% 
between 6 to 9 weeks of treatment. Dose interruptions in the subsequent 3-week intervals were <10%. The 
proportion of patients requiring only one dose interruption was 14.3%for ceritinib, and the median time to 
first dose interruption was 6.1 weeks (range: 0.6 to 91.9).In the ceritinib group, the most frequently 
reported reason for dose interruptions was AEs(95.3%), and primarily due to AEs of liver enzyme elevations. 
The proportion of patients requiring at least one dose interruption was 44.6% for pemetrexed, 16.1% for 
cisplatin, and 19.0% for carboplatin. The proportion of patients requiring only one dose interruption was 
22.9% for pemetrexed, 9.2% for cisplatin, and 15.0% for carboplatin. The median time to first dose 
interruption was 10.1 weeks (range: 3.0 to 104.3) for pemetrexed, 6.2 weeks (range: 3.0 to 9.7) for 
cisplatin, and 6.1 weeks (3.1 to 10.6) for carboplatin. Among the patients with at least one dose 
interruption, the most frequently reported cause for dose interruption was the occurrence of AEs 
(pemetrexed: 73.1%, cisplatin:78.6%, and carboplatin: 78.9%. The dose interruptions/delays were 
primarily due to hematology related AEs.  
Assessment report  
EMA/386332/2017 
Page 64/101 
 
  
  
 
Dose reductions: The proportion of patients requiring at least one dose reduction was 67.7% for ceritinib in 
study A2301. Dose reductions for ceritinib occurred throughout the treatment period with a higher 
percentage of dose reductions occurring during Week 3 to 6 (17.5%) and Week 6 to 9 (11.1%). Dose 
reduction in the subsequent 3-week intervals was <10%. The proportion of patients with only one dose 
reduction for ceritinib was 27.0%, and the median time to first dose reduction was 9.1 weeks (range: 0.9 to 
85.1 weeks). The dose reductions were primarily due to AEs of liver enzyme elevations and GI AEs.  
The proportions of patients requiring at least one dose reduction were 14.3%, 6.9%, and 15.0% for 
pemetrexed, cisplatin, and carboplatin, respectively. The proportion of patients requiring only one dose 
reduction was 12.0%, 6.9%, and 13.0% of for pemetrexed, cisplatin, and carboplatin. Among the patients 
with at least one dose reduction, the most frequently reported reason was the occurrence of AEs for 
pemetrexed (23/25, 92.0%), cisplatin (6/6, 100.0%) and carboplatin (13/15, 86.7%). The dose 
adjustments were primarily due to haematology related AEs. 
Pooled dataset 
Dose interruptions: The proportion of patients requiring at least one dose interruption of ceritinib treatment 
was 74.8%, and the dose interruptions occurred over the treatment period, with the highest percentage of 
dose interruption occurring during 3 to 6 weeks (20.3%). Dose interruptions in the other 3-week intervals 
were ≤ 15%.The proportion of patients requiring only one dose interruption was 18.8%; the median time to 
first dose interruption was 6.1 weeks (range: 0.3 to 122.9 weeks). Among the patients with at least one dose 
interruption, the most frequently reported reason for dose interruption was the occurrence of AEs (92.2%). 
The dose interruptions were primarily due to elevations in liver enzymes. 
Dose reductions: In the pooled dataset, 575 patients (62.2%) required at least one dose reduction of 
ceritinib treatment. Dose reductions for ceritinib occurred throughout the treatment period with a higher 
percentage of dose reductions occurring during Week 3 and 6 of treatment (14.3%) and Week 6 and 9 of 
treatment (12.0%). Dose reductions in the other 3-week intervals were <10%.The proportion of patients 
requiring only one dose reduction was 29.7%, and the median time to first dose reduction was 7.4 weeks 
(range: 0.4 to 148 weeks). Among the patients with at least one dose reduction, the primary reason for dose 
reductions were AEs (531 patients, 92.3%), and the dose reductions were primarily due to elevations in liver 
enzymes and GI AEs. 
Demographic and other characteristics of study population 
Characteristics of patients enrolled in study A2301 are summarised in the clinical efficacy section. 
The pooled dataset is predominantly representative of previously treated ALK-positive advanced NSCLC 
patients including predominantly chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy and crizotinib, except for A2301; 
the demographics were similar in Study A2301 and pooled dataset, except for WHO performance status. 
Patients had a median age of 53 years (range: 22 to 82 years), 81.8% of the patients were<65 years old, 
and 53.5% were female patients. Majority of the patients were either Caucasians (51.1%) or Asians 
(46.1%). In addition, 90.6% of patients had WHO/ECOG PS score of 0-1. Smoking history was not collected 
in studies X1101, A2201 andA2203; therefore smoking history of the pooled dataset is not presented. The 
median time since initial diagnosis of primary site to start of study treatment in the pooled dataset was 14.3 
(range: 0.5 to 283.1months) reflecting the more advanced disease of these patients with previous 
treatments (StudyA2301 - 1.6 months, range: 0.5 to 129.1 months). Adenocarcinoma was the predominant 
histology (94.9%), and majority of the patients (78.3%) presented with Stage IV disease at the time of 
diagnosis. Key sites of metastatic disease were typical of patients with metastatic or locally advanced 
NSCLC–brain (50.3%), bone (46.3%), and liver (32.4%). The patients in the pooled dataset were heavily 
pretreated (72.3% of patients received at least one prior systemic regimen for the treatment of ALK-positive 
advanced NSCLC).

One SAE of pneumonitis (grade 3) was reported that was not suspected related to ceritinib treatment, also 
mentioned under Deaths.  
The incidence of serious AESIs (regardless of study drug relationship) in the pooled dataset was as follows: 
•  Hepatotoxicity: 23 patients (2.5%) 
• 
ILD/pneumonitis: 16 patients (1.7%) 
•  QT prolongation: Seven patients (0.8%) 
•  Bradycardia-related: Four patients (0.4%) 
•  Hyperglycaemia: 20 patients (2.2%) 
•  GI toxicity: 46 patients (5.0%) 
•

Interstitial lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis 
Study A2301 
In Study A2301, the ILD/pneumonitis AEs (all grades, regardless of study drug relationship) were reported 
in four patients (2.1%) treated in the ceritinib arm, with PTs of pneumonitis (three patients, 1.6%) and lung 
infiltration (one patient, 0.5%). One patient (0.5%) had grade ≥ 3 AE of pneumonitis (also reported as an 
SAE, assessed as not related to ceritinib by the Investigator, and required dose interruption). No other AEs 
requiring dose adjustment or interruptions were reported. Pneumonitis AEs led to study drug discontinuation 
in two patients (1.1%). SAE of pneumonitis was reported in one patient (0.5%), grade 3 pneumonitis on Day 
272, study medication was interrupted, and the patient died two days later (on Day 274). The Investigator 
assessed the event as not related to ceritinib. 
Pooled dataset 
Interstitial lung disease/pneumonitis AEs (all grades, regardless of study drug relationship) were reported in 
2.4% of patients – pneumonitis (1.6%), ILD (0.4%) and lung infiltration (0.3%). Grade 3/4 AEs were 
reported in 1.3% of patients – pneumonitis (1.0%), ILD (0.2%) and lung infiltration (0.1%). Pneumonitis 
events were assessed as related to ceritinib treatment by the Investigator in 16 patients (1.7%).The events 
required dose adjustment or interruption in 11 patients (1.2%) and led to discontinuation of ceritinib 
treatment in 10 patients (1.1%). Two deaths due to pneumonitis were reported. In patients who had grade 
<3 ILD/pneumonitis at baseline, the median time to onset of grade ≥ 3 ILD/pneumonitis was 18.57 weeks 
(range: 3.1 to 38.9 weeks).

Bradycardia 
Study A2301 
AE of bradycardia was rarely reported in Study A2301 ceritinib group and pooled dataset (<2% of patients), 
all were grade 1-2, none were serious and none led to discontinuation of ceritinib treatment.  
In the Study A2301, bradycardia events (all grades, regardless of study drug relationship) were reported in 
29 patients (15.3%) in the ceritinib group. These included the AE of ECG QT prolonged reported in 21 
patients (11.1%) which has also been reported under QT prolongation AESI category. An actual AE of 
bradycardia and sinus bradycardia was reported in three patients each (1.6%), none of which was grade 3/4 
or serious or led to study treatment discontinuation. Two AEs of bradycardia were suspected to be study 
drug related, and two AEs of bradycardia required dose adjustment or interruption. One SAE of nodal rhythm 
was reported that was not suspected to study treatment. 
Based on ECG data, ten (5.3%) patients in the ceritinib group had a decrease in the heart rate(HR) of >25% 
from baseline and to <50 beats per minute, of which it was reported as a no serious AE of sinus bradycardia 
in two patients and a non-serious AE of bradycardia in one patient. In the chemotherapy group, a decrease 
in the heart rate (HR) of >25% from baseline and to <50 beats per minute was reported in one (0.6%) 
patient. 
Pooled dataset 
In the pooled dataset, bradycardia events (all grades, regardless of study drug relationship) were reported 
in 121 patients (13.1%). These included the AEs of ECG QT prolonged in 90 patients (9.7%) and syncope in 
seven patients (0.8%) which have also been reported under QT prolongation AESI category. SAEs were 
reported in four patients, with ECG QT prolonged in three patients (0.3%),nodal rhythm and syncope in one 
patient each (0.1%). No deaths due to bradycardia AEs were reported. 
The PTs ‘bradycardia’ and ‘sinus bradycardia’ were reported in 11 patients (1.2%) and 10 patients (1.1%), 
all grade 1-2, and none of these were serious. Other AEs that were reported were – right bundle branch block 
in three patients (0.3%); atrioventricular block and first degree atrioventricular block (each in two patients, 
0.2%); ECG PR shortened, ECG QRS complex prolonged, and nodal rhythm (each in one patient, 0.1%) – all 
non-serious. 
Two patients with PT of bradycardia (0.2%) and one patient with PT of nodal rhythm (0.1%) required dose 
adjustment/ interruption. None of the bradycardia related AEs required study drug discontinuation. 
Based on ECG data, there were 40 patients (4.4%) in the ceritinib group having a decrease in the HR more 
than 25% and less than 50 beats per minute compared to baseline. 
Asymptomatic cases of bradycardia (heart rate less than 60 bpm) have been observed in 21 out of 
925 (2.3%) patients treated with ceritinib in clinical studies.

Pancreatitis 
Study A2301 
In the Study A2301, pancreatitis grouped AEs (all grades, regardless of study drug relationship) were 
reported in 22 patients (11.6%) in ceritinib treatment group, with grade 3/4 AEs reported in 15 patients 
(7.9%), all of them being laboratory pancreas function test abnormalities. The AEs reported were amylase 
increased in 19 patients (10.1%), and lipase increased in seven patients (3.7%). No AEs with PT of 
“pancreatitis” were reported. Majority of the reported laboratory pancreatic test abnormalities (15 patients, 
7.9%) were suspected to be study drug-related. Six patients (3.2%) required dose adjustments or 
interruptions. Three patients (1.6%) required treatment discontinuation –lipase increased in two patients 
and amylase increased in two patients. No SAEs or deaths related to these events were reported. 
Amylase/lipase laboratory abnormalities:  
Based on the laboratory parameters, of the 189 patients treated with ceritinib the majority of patients (158 
patients, 83.6%) had normal amylase (grade 0) at baseline. Post-baseline, 67patients (35.4%) had amylase 
increase, of which 43 patients had grade 1 (22.8%), 10 patients had grade 2 (5.3%), 13 patients had grade 
3 (6.9%) and one patient had grade 4 (0.5%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/386332/2017 
Page 76/101 
 
  
  
 
Lipase values were not available for the patients at baseline since this parameter was not routinely collected 
as part of the initial protocol. Post-baseline, 21 patients (11.1%) had lipase elevations of any grade, of which 
eight patients (4.2%), three patients (1.6%), nine patients (4.8%), and one patient (0.5%) had grade 1, 
grade 2, grade 3, and grade 4 lipase elevations, respectively. 
Pooled dataset 
In the pooled dataset, pancreatitis grouped AEs (all grades, regardless of study drug relationship) were 
reported in 89 patients (9.6%), with majority of the patients having laboratory pancreatic test abnormalities 
without reported evidence of pancreatitis. Pancreatitis as a PT was reported in five patients (all grade ≥ 3 
and reported as SAEs) and one patient presented with pancreatitis pseudocyst. Grade 3/4 pancreatitis 
grouped AEs were reported in 54 patients (5.8%)– lipase increased in 32 patients (3.5%), amylase 
increased in 29 patients (3.1%), and pancreatitis in five patients (0.5%). Majority of the AEs (68 patients, 
7.4%) were suspected to be study drug-related. Most of the AEs were managed with dose adjustments or 
interruptions (37 patients, 4.0%), and led to treatment discontinuation in five patients (0.5%) – lipase 
increased in three patients and amylase increased in two patients. 
Adverse events with PT of “pancreatitis” were reported in five patients (0.5%), all of which were grade 3/4, 
and serious. Four of these events of pancreatitis were managed with dose adjustment or interruption, and 
treatment was discontinued in one patient. No deaths due to these events were reported. 
Amylase/lipase laboratory abnormalities: Based on the laboratory parameters, of the 925 patients treated 
with ceritinib majority of the patients (84.5%) had normal amylase (grade 0) at baseline. Post-baseline, 
35.8% of patients had amylase increase of any grade, of which 23.4%, 5.9%, 5.4% and 1.1% had grade 1, 
grade 2, grade 3, and grade 4amylase increase, respectively. Of note, 2.3% of patients and 0.3% had 
grade3 and grade 4 elevated amylase levels already at baseline. 
Other safety observations 
AEs and laboratory abnormalities associated with creatinine increase and renal function 
Study A2301 
In study A2301, 22.2% of patients in the ceritinib group had creatinine elevations based on AEs (PT of blood 
creatinine increased). Most of the AEs reported were suspected to be related to study drug (19.6%) and 
were of grade 1 or 2 in severity in 18% of patients and grade 3 in 1.6%. Events were reported as SAE in 
1.6% of patients, and led to discontinuation of study drug 2.1%. Adverse events requiring dose adjustment 
or interruption were reported in 13.8% of patients. Further, decreased creatinine renal clearance was 
reported as AEs in 13 (6.9%) patients; of which two patients had grade 3 and two had grade 4 event. Most 
of the events were suspected to be study drug related in 11 (5.8%) patients. No SAEs were reported and led 
to discontinuation of study drug due to grade 4 event in one patient. Adverse events requiring dose 
adjustment or interruption were reported in four (2.1%) patients. 
Based on laboratory assessments, most of the patients had normal creatinine value at baseline in the 
ceritinib group (95.8%). Post-baseline, 108 (57.1%) patients and eight (4.2%) patients had grade 2 and 
grade 3 increased creatinine values, respectively. No grade 4 increased creatinine value was reported. 
Creatinine clearance was normal at baseline for most of the patients (91.5%). Post-baseline, grade 2, grade 
3 and grade 4 decreased creatinine clearance were noted in 91 (48.1%), 8 (4.2%) and 2 (1.1%) patients, 
respectively. 
Under the SOC of ‘renal and urinary disorders’ AEs were reported in 19 (10.1%) patients in the ceritinib 
group. Most of these events were grade 1 or 2 in severity (17/19) and only two patients had grade 3 AEs

(chronic kidney disease and hydronephrosis), both considered related to ceritinib treatment; there were no 
grade 4 events. 
Analysis of mean/median blood creatinine levels at screening and during the course of the study showed an 
early increase after start of ceritinib (i.e. Day 15) with steady levels thereafter without further accumulation, 
and recovery upon treatment discontinuation.  
Pooled dataset 
The frequency and severity of creatinine increase reported in Study A2301 ceritinib group is consistent 
(<3% difference) with the pooled dataset. In the pooled dataset, 204 patients (22.1%) reported creatinine 
elevations based on AEs (PT of blood creatinine increased), majority of the AEs were grade 1 or 2, with grade 
3 reported in five patients (0.5%), no grade 4 AEs were reported. The events were managed by ceritinib 
dose adjustment or interruption in 64 patients (6.9%), and led to discontinuation of ceritinib treatment in 
four patients (0.4%). Events were reported as SAE in six (0.6%) patients. 
In the pooled dataset, under the SOC of ‘renal and urinary disorders’ AEs were reported in 108 (11.7%) 
patients, majority of the events were grade 1 or 2, with grade 3 reported in 15 patients (1.6%), no grade 4 
events were reported. In 15 patients (1.6%), for AEs under SOC of ‘renal and urinary disorders’ ceritinib 
dose was adjusted or interrupted, and led to ceritinib discontinuation in two patients (0.2%, grade 3 acute 
kidney injury and grade 3 renal failure). Serious adverse events were reported in ten patients (1.1%). No 
deaths due to AEs under the SOC of ‘renal and urinary disorders’ were reported.  
Six hundred and thirty eight patients (69.0%) had worst post-baseline any grade creatinine increase; 17 
patients (1.8%) and one patient (0.1%) had grade 3 and grade 4 creatinine increase, respectively. The 
frequencies of grade 3/4 creatinine elevations were low despite prolonged treatment with ceritinib, 
indicating that creatinine elevations did not worsen over time with continued treatment.

Serious adverse events considered related to ceritinib treatment 
Study A2301 ceritinib group 
Thirty patients (15.9%) from the ceritinib group experienced SAEs that were suspected by the Investigator 
to be related to study treatment. This was similar to the chemotherapy group (15.4%). 
The most frequently reported (in ≥ 2% of patients) study drug-related SAEs in the ceritinib group were 
nausea and vomiting (each in six patients, 3.2%) and AST increased (2.1%). Majority of these SAEs 
suspected to be drug-related were grade 3/4 in severity (12.2%). There were no drug-related SAEs with 
fatal outcome in the ceritinib group.  
Of note, one patient had QT-prolongation considered as a SAE related to ceritinib. There were no 
drug-related SAEs with fatal outcome in the ceritinib group. 
Pooled dataset 
Serious adverse events that were suspected by the Investigator to be related to ceritinib treatment were 
reported in 123 patients (13.3%). Suspected SAEs (by individual PT) were each reported in <1% of patients, 
with the exception of nausea and vomiting (each 18 patients, 1.9%), pericarditis (10 patients, 1.1%), and 
pneumonitis (nine patients, 1.0%). 
One SAE of ILD (grade 4) was reported in one patient that was suspected to ceritinib treatment and led to 
death. Another SAE of pneumonitis (grade 3) reported in another patient was not suspected to ceritinib 
treatment and led to death. None of the other SAEs for these AESIs were the primary cause of death. 
Deaths 
On-treatment deaths were defined as deaths while receiving study medication or up to 30 days after the last 
dose of study treatment.

Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
In ceritinib-treated patients, haematological abnormalities were predominantly grade 1 or 2 in Study A2301 
ceritinib group and pooled dataset. The frequency of any post-baseline grade changes in haematological 
parameters was similar (≤ 10% difference) in Study A2301 ceritinib group and pooled dataset. The most 
frequently occurring (>5%) grade 3/4 haematological abnormalities were seen for decreased lymphocytes.  
In Study A2301 ceritinib group, of the 189 patients treated with ceritinib, majority of the patients (161 
patients, 85.2%) had normal absolute lymphocytes (grade 0) at baseline. Post-baseline, 109 patients 
(57.7%) had decreased absolute lymphocytes of any grade, of which 45 patients (23.8%), 44 patients 
(23.3%), 15 patients (7.9%), and five patients (2.6%) had grade 1, grade 2, grade 3, and grade 4 
decreased absolute lymphocytes, respectively. In the pooled dataset, of the 925 patients treated with 
ceritinib, majority of the patients (604 patients, 65.3%) had normal absolute lymphocytes (grade 0) at 
baseline. Post-baseline, 642 patients (69.4%) had decreased absolute lymphocytes of any grade, of which 
184 patients (19.9%), 260 patients (28.1%), 167 patients (18.1%), and 31 patients (3.4%) had grade 1, 
grade 2, grade 3, and grade 4 decreased absolute lymphocytes, respectively. 
In the A2301 chemotherapy group, the most frequently occurring (>5%) grade 3/4 haematological 
abnormalities were seen for decreased absolute lymphocytes (grade 3 in 17.7% and grade 4 in 1.7%), 
decreased absolute neutrophils (grade 3 in 12.0% and grade 4 in 7.4%), decreased haemoglobin (grade 3 
in 10.9%, no grade 4), decreased platelet count (grade 3 in 3.4% and grade 4 in 1.7%), and decreased WBC 
(grade 3 in 5.7% and grade 4 in 1.1%). 
Clinical chemistry 
The frequency of any post-baseline grade changes in chemistry parameters was similar (≤ 10% difference) 
in Study A2301 ceritinib group and pooled dataset, except for decreased creatinine clearance (54.5% in 
Study A2301 ceritinib group, 39.2% in pooled dataset; grade 3/4 decrease were similar, 5.3% in A2301 
ceritinib group and 3.1% in pooled dataset), decreased glucose (54.5% in Study A2301 ceritinib group, 
38.6% in pooled dataset; grade 3/4 decrease were similar, 0.5% in A2301 ceritinib group and 0.9% in 
pooled dataset), and increased potassium (36% in Study A2301 ceritinib group, 25.3% in pooled dataset; 
grade 3/4 increases were similar, 3.2% in A2301 ceritinib group and 1.8% in pooled dataset). 
The most frequent (>5%) post-baseline grade 3/4 chemistry increase in ceritinib treated patients in Study 
A2301 ceritinib group and pooled dataset were reported for liver enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, and GGT), 
however there were no confirmed Hy’s law cases, glucose and amylase (only in the pooled dataset). 
The most frequent (>5%) post-baseline grade 3/4 chemistry decrease in ceritinib treated patients in Study 
A2301 ceritinib group were reported for: 
•  Sodium: In Study A2301 ceritinib group, of the 189 patients treated with ceritinib, majority of the 
patients (97.4%) had normal sodium (grade 0) at baseline. Post-baseline, 27% of patients had 
decreased sodium of any grade, of which 19.0%, 7.4%, and 0.5% had grade 1, grade 3, and grade 4 
decreased sodium, respectively. In the pooled dataset, of the 925 patients treated with ceritinib, majority 
of the patients (93.3%) had normal sodium (grade 0) at baseline. Post-baseline, 33% of patients had 
decreased sodium of any grade, of which 25.2%, 7.7%, and 0.1% had grade 1, grade 3, and grade 4 
decreased sodium, respectively. 
•  Potassium (only in the pooled dataset): In the pooled dataset, of the 925 patients treated with ceritinib, 
majority of the patients (97.9%) had normal potassium (grade 0) at baseline. Post-baseline, 21.6% of 
patients had decreased potassium of any grade, of which 15.7%, 5.2%, and 0.8% had grade 2, grade 3, 
and grade 4 decreased potassium, respectively.

•  Phosphate (only in pooled dataset): In the pooled dataset, of the 925 patients treated with ceritinib, 
majority of the patients (89.9%) had normal phosphate (grade 0) at baseline. Post-baseline, 43.3% of 
patients had decreased phosphate of any grade, of which 9.2%, 27.7%, 6.4%, and 0.1% had grade 1, 
grade 2, grade 3, and grade 4 decreased phosphate, respectively. 
In chemotherapy group, the most frequently reported (>5%) grade 3/4 chemistry parameters were seen for 
increased glucose (grade 3 in 10.3%, no grade 4) and decreased sodium (grade 3 in 5.1%, no grade 4).  
Special laboratory evaluations 
In Study A2301, testosterone, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and sex 
hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) were measured in male patients to assess potential impact of ceritinib on 
male hormone levels. Analysis of total testosterone (free and bound), free testosterone index, LH, FSH and 
SHBG did not show significant changes between baseline and post-baseline measurement (i.e. D15). 
Safety in special populations 
The subgroup analysis of safety by region, age, gender, race, presence or absence of brain metastases 
(based on CRF data), presence or absence of prior adjuvant chemotherapy, and WHO PS (0 vs. 1-2; based 
on CRF data) at baseline showed patterns that were generally consistent with those of the overall population 
and did not reveal any relevant clinically meaningful differences in the overall proportion of patients with AEs 
within subgroups. 
No specific analyses were conducted to evaluate the use of other drugs, tobacco, alcohol on the tolerability 
and safety of ceritinib. 
Ceritinib is eliminated primarily via the liver. So far, there is limited experience in patients with pre-existing 
moderate (only 1 patient) or no experience in patients with severe hepatic impairment. A PK study is 
currently ongoing to assess the effect of hepatic impairment in non-cancer patients. 
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment since population 
pharmacokinetic analysis have shown that ceritinib exposure is similar in patients with mild and moderate 
renal impairment and normal renal function. Patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) were 
not included in the clinical trials. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No safety data regarding drug-drug interactions.

Analysis of safety after crossover in Phase III studies 
Safety in the subgroup of patients who crossed over to ceritinib in Study A2301 
Among the 85 patients who crossed over, 80 patients received ceritinib in the extension treatment phase 
(three patients did not receive ceritinib as of the data cut-off date and other two patients had died before 
start of first dose of ceritinib). At the time of the data cut-off, 33/80 patients were still ongoing in the 
extension treatment phase. 
The most frequently reported all grade AEs (regardless of study drug relationship) in the extension 
treatment phase (≥ 20% of patients) were: diarrhoea (75.0%), vomiting (52.5%), nausea and ALT 
increased (each 51.3%), AST increased (46.3%), blood creatinine increased (37.5%), fatigue (25.0%), GGT 
increased (23.8%), blood alkaline phosphatase increased (21.3%), and decreased appetite (20.0%).  
The AEs in the extension treatment phase were similar (<10% difference) to the treatment phase ceritinib 
group except for: nausea (51.3% vs. 68.8%), vomiting (52.5% vs. 66.1%), GGT increased (23.8% vs. 
37.0%), decreased appetite (20.0% vs. 33.9%), cough (13.8% vs. 24.3%), blood creatinine increased 
(37.5% vs. 22.2%), and pyrexia (7.5% vs. 18.0%), respectively.

Blood creatinine AE increased was reported more frequently in patients treated in the extension treatment 
phase than in the treatment phase (37.5% and 22.2%, respectively), and an AE of decreased creatinine 
clearance was reported in 6.9% patients in treatment phase and in 7.5% of patients in the extension 
treatment phase. Blood creatinine AE increased was reported more frequently in patients treated in the 
extension treatment phase than in the treatment phase (37.5% and 22.2%, respectively). 
Fifty-five (68.8%) patients had grade 3/4 AEs, and the most frequently reported grade 3/4 AEs (>5% of 
patients) included: ALT increased and GGT increased (each 20.0%); fatigue (13.8%); AST increased 
(11.3%); blood alkaline phosphatase increased, decreased appetite, and back pain (each 6.3%). The grade 
3/4 AEs in the extension treatment phase were similar (<5% difference) to the treatment phase ceritinib 
group except for: ALT increased (20.0 vs. 30.7), AST increased (11.3 vs. 16.9), fatigue (13.8 vs. 4.2), GGT 
increased (20.0 vs. 28.6), decreased appetite (6.3 vs. 1.1), respectively. 
Serious adverse events were reported in 34 (42.5%) patients, of which was suspected to be drug related in 
11 patients (13.8%). 
Nine patients (11%) discontinued due to AEs (acute kidney injury, creatinine renal clearance decreased, 
pneumonia, blood creatinine increased, ALT increased, ILD – all suspected) and cancer pain, and lung 
infection (not suspected). 
Among the 11 patients who died on-treatment in the extension treatment phase, six patients died due to 
study indication and five patients died due to other causes: pneumonia, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, 
pulmonary embolism, and respiratory failure in one patient each; none of these AEs were suspected to be

Study A2303 
Study A2303, was an open-label, randomized, global Phase III study to compare the efficacy and safety of 
ceritinib to standard second-line chemotherapy (pemetrexed or docetaxel) in patients with advanced 
ALK-positive NSCLC who were previously treated with chemotherapy (including a platinum-based doublet) 
and crizotinib, and had demonstrated disease progression at study entry. Patients randomized to the 
chemotherapy arm were allowed to crossover to receive ceritinib therapy in the Extension Treatment Phase 
only after BIRC confirmed RECIST defined disease progression. 
Seventy five patients from the chemotherapy arm crossed over to ceritinib, and entered the extension 
treatment phase.  
The overall safety profile for the patients who crossed-over to ceritinib in the extension treatment phase was 
similar to the safety profile of patients in the ceritinib group in the treatment phase.  
Table 42: Overall summary of AEs (Cross-over analysis set) 
The most frequently reported all grade AEs (regardless of study drug relationship) in the extension 
treatment phase (≥ 20% of patients) were: diarrhoea (71.6%), nausea (56.8%), vomiting (47.3%), ALT 
increased (29.7%), decreased appetite (27.0%), AST increased (25.7%), blood creatinine increased 
(24.3%), abdominal pain (23.0%), constipation and fatigue (each 21.6%), and GGT increased (20.3%). The 
AEs in the extension treatment phase were similar (<10% difference) to the treatment phase ceritinib arm 
except for: ALT increased (29.7% vs. 42.6%), AST increased (25.7% vs. 36.5%), weight decreased (16.2% 
vs. 29.6%), decreased appetite (27.0% vs. 41.7%), and back pain (9.5% vs. 21.7%), respectively. 
Fifty-five (74.3%) patients had grade 3/4 AEs, and the most frequently reported grade 3/4 AEs (>5% of 
patients) included: ALT increased (17.6%); nausea, AST increased, and GGT increased (each 10.8%); 
vomiting (9.5%); fatigue and dyspnoea (each 6.8%); diarrhoea, pleural effusion, and pneumonia (each 
5.4%). The grade 3/4 AEs in the extension treatment phase were similar (<5% difference) to the treatment 
phase ceritinib group except for GGT increased (10.8% vs. 20.9%), respectively. 
Serious adverse events were reported in 38 patients (51.4%); pneumonia, pleural effusion, and nausea 
were reported in >5% of patients. 
No Hy’s law case was observed in the extension treatment phase (i.e. concurrent AT >3xULN and TBILI

Post marketing experience 
The latest Zykadia PSUR (PSUR 4) with a data lock point of 28 April 2016 provides additional information on 
estimated 3700 patients treated with ceritinib in post-marketing setting. 
Additional safety information (cumulative line listings of deaths and SAEs) reported in the Novartis global 
pharmacovigilance safety database (ARGUS) for 21 ongoing and two completed Novartis-sponsored studies 
including healthy volunteer studies consisting of 1927 enrolled patients based on the data cut-off date of 10 
August 2016 is provided. The evaluation did not reveal any new safety concern or any meaningful change in 
frequency or severity. The safety data is consistent with the known safety profile of ceritinib described 
above. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
This safety review of ceritinib in first-line treatment of ALK positive NSCLC is based on the results of the 
pivotal phase III Study A2301 and a pooled dataset of seven clinical studies, which includes data on ceritinib 
from the pivotal trial.  
With the pivotal trial of this application, the safety database for ceritinib in the treatment of ALK positive 
NSCLC now includes 925 patients and more data on long-term exposure to ceritinib is available. In study 
A2301, 72.5% of patients were treated for ≥ than 33 weeks and median exposure was 66.4 weeks. In the 
pooled dataset, the median exposure is 44.9 weeks. 
As observed in previous trials with ceritinib, the rate of dose reductions and interruptions are high in study 
A2301, 67.7% and 78.3% respectively. This is even higher than in phase III trial A2303 conducted in 
previously treated ALK positive NSCLC patients. Most of the dose reductions and interruptions for ceritinib 
are due to AEs, 57.7% and 44.9% in study A2301 and the pooled dataset, respectively. The main reason for 
dose adjustments and dose interruptions is liver toxicity, i.e. increased ALT and AST. 
The toxicity profile of ceritinib compared with the toxicity profile of the platinum doublets used in the pivotal 
study A2301 seems acceptable. The higher frequency of GI toxicity with ceritinib is mainly due to grade 1/2 
AEs, and managed with additional therapies. The liver toxicity observed with ceritinib is mainly managed 
with dose adjustments. 
Overall, the safety profile of ceritinib is considered similar to previous experience and AEs. However, 
compared to previous studies, there is an increase in liver toxicity in terms of increased frequencies of ALT 
and AST increase and also GGT increase. In addition, a higher frequency of decreased creatinine clearance 
than in previous studies is observed. These AEs lead to a higher rate of dose reductions and interruptions 
than previously reported. Based on exposure-response analyses, the applicant has concluded that there is a 
clear relationship between exposure level and AEs of ALT/AST elevations while no exposure efficacy 
relationship has been found. The high rate of dose reductions/interruptions may indicate that a lower dose 
of ceritinib from start of treatment could be more appropriate from a safety perspective. 
No fatal outcome associated with any of the AESIs was reported with the exception of two deaths with 
pneumonitis in the pooled dataset (one patient with grade 4 ILD that was suspected to be related to ceritinib 
treatment, and another patient with grade 3 pneumonitis that was assessed as not related to ceritinib 
treatment). 
There was a high rate of AE suspected to be drug-related (97.4%, grade ≥3, 65.1%) and AEs that requiring 
dose adjustment (57.7%, grade ≥3 34.9%) or interruption (69.3%, grade ≥3, 41.3%) of ceritinib. AEs 
suspected to be study drug related and Grade 3/4 AEs suspected to be study drug related were more 
frequent among patients receiving ceritinib than patients in the pooled dataset. 
Assessment report  
EMA/386332/2017

Dose interruption and dose reductions for ceritinib occurred over the treatment period, with the highest 
percentage of dose interruption and dose reductions occurring between weeks 3 to 6 of treatment (24.9% 
and 17.5% respectively). In the ceritinib group, the most frequently reported reason for dose interruptions 
was AEs (95.3%), and primarily due to AEs of liver enzyme elevations. The dose reductions were primarily 
due to AEs of liver enzyme elevations and GI AEs. Many patients requiring dose adjustment, interruption or 
reduction.  
The proportion of patients requiring at least one dose interruption was 78.3% for ceritinib. In the ceritinib 
group, the dose interruptions were primarily due to AEs of liver enzyme elevations while dose reductions 
were primarily due to AEs of liver enzyme elevations and GI AEs. 
In line with the current safety profile of ceritinib, hepatotoxicity AEs regardless of study drug relationship 
were the second most frequently reported AESIs (>60% of patients treated with ceritinib in Study A2301 
and pooled dataset), with majority of them being elevation of liver function tests. Grade 3/4 hepatotoxicity 
AEs regardless of study drug relationship were reported in 49.2% of patients in Study A2301 and in 37.8% 
of patients in pooled dataset. Also, elevations of liver enzymes were the only grade 3/4 AEs requiring dose 
adjustment or interruption that were more frequently reported (≥ 5% difference) in the Study A2301 
ceritinib group vs. pooled dataset. The review of the overall safety profile of ceritinib in patients with hepatic 
impairment versus patients without hepatic impairment in Study A2301 did not reveal any clinically relevant 
differences or new safety concerns, and is consistent with the known safety profile of ceritinib. 
The incidence of QT prolongation AEs in Study A2301 ceritinib group and pooled safety dataset was 11.1% 
and 10.8%, respectively; grade 3 QT prolongation AEs were reported in 2.1% of patients, there were no 
grade  4  QT  prolongations  AEs;  AEs  requiring  discontinuation  of  ceritinib  treatment  were  none  in  Study 
A2301  ceritinib  group  and  0.2%  in  pooled  safety  dataset.  SAEs  of  QT  prolongation  were  0.5%  in  Study 
A2301 ceritinib group and 0.8% in pooled safety dataset. No torsade de pointes, sudden death, or deaths 
due  to  QT  prolongation  AEs  were  reported.  No  patients  with  QT  prolongation  had  syncope/loss  of 
consciousness.  
QTcP increases of > 60 ms baseline were reported in 7.9% of patients in Study A2301 and 6.3% of patients 
in the pooled safety dataset. QTcP interval >500 ms was reported at similar frequencies in Study A2301 and 
the pooled safety dataset (2.6% and 1.3%, respectively). 
An analysis of patients with a heart rate below 60 bpm as observed on the baseline ECG treated with ceritinib 
compared to the patients with a normal heart rate at baseline and treated with ceritinib, and compared to 
similar groups of patients in the pooled safety dataset did not reveal any clinically meaningful differences 
between the groups. 
Hyperglycaemia events regardless of study drug relationship were reported in 13% of patients treated with 
ceritinib in Study A2301 and pooled dataset, of which were grade 3/4 AEs in 7-8% of patients. The 
hyperglycaemia events were managed by dose interruption or reduction. Post-baseline any grade increase 
of glucose was noted in approximately half of the patients in the Study A2301 ceritinib group and pooled 
dataset.  
Creatinine elevations based on AEs regardless of study drug relationship were reported in 22% of patients 
treated with ceritinib in Study A2301 and pooled dataset. The AEs were managed by dose interruption or 
reduction. 69.0% of patients had creatinine increase of any grade post-baseline, of which 17 patients 
(1.8%) and one patient (0.1%) had grade 3 and grade 4 creatinine increase, respectively.  
The frequency of any post-baseline grade changes in chemistry parameters was similar (≤10% difference) 
in Study A2301 ceritinib group and pooled dataset, except for decreased creatinine clearance, decreased 
glucose and increased potassium.

2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The changes introduced in the context of this application are not considered to have a relevant impact on the 
readability of the package leaflet. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The MAH has applied for a new indication for Zykadia the first-line treatment of adult patients with anaplastic 
lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
Approximately 85% of all lung cancers are NSCLC, further divided into squamous and non-squamous 
(including adenocarcinoma). Adenocarcinoma (40% of lung cancers) is the most common type of lung 
cancer. Frequency of ALK-positive NSCLC is low; present in approximately 2 to 7% of tumours, which 
represents about 60,000 patients annually worldwide. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Currently approved first-line therapies for ALK-positive advanced NSCLC are either crizotinib or 
chemotherapy. Nevertheless, crizotinib has shown to significantly prolong the progression-free survival, 
offering more profound and durable responses than chemotherapy. OS data were not mature enough, but a 
positive trend was shown.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal study was a phase III (study A2301; ASCEND-4), open-label, randomised, active-controlled, 
global study of oral ceritinib (750 mg once daily, fasted) vs. standard first-line chemotherapy 
(platinum-based doublet with pemetrexed followed by pemetrexed maintenance in patients without 
progressive disease after 4 cycles) in adult patients with advanced or metastatic non-squamous NSCLC, 
harbouring an ALK rearrangement. Patients enrolled were previously not treated with any systemic 
anti-cancer therapy (including ALK inhibitor) with exception of patients that received neo-adjuvant or 
adjuvant therapy if progression/relapse had not occurred within 12 months after end of neo-adjuvant or 
adjuvant therapy. Crossover of patients in the chemotherapy treatment arm was allowed to ceritinib 
treatment arm in the extension treatment phase, only after BIRC-confirmed RECIST-defined PD was 
documented. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Study  A2301  met  its  primary  objective  showing  a  statistically  significant  benefit  of  ceritinib  over 
chemotherapy in delaying disease progression (PFS as per BIRC). Patients treated with ceritinib in first line 
ALK+ NSCLC obtained a median PFS gain of 8 months (16 months ceritinib vs 8 months chemotherapy) and  
with a HR of 0.55 (95% CI: 0.42, 0.73).  
PFS results by investigator’s assessment (secondary endpoint) offer similar results to the primary analysis 
based on BIRC (HR=0.49; 95% CI: 0.37, 0.64). The estimated median PFS was 16.8 months (95% CI: 13.5, 
25.2) in the ceritinib arm vs. 7.2 months (95% CI: 5.8, 9.7) in chemotherapy. 
Assessment report  
EMA/386332/2017 
Page 97/101 
 
  
  
The ORR by BIRC was higher in the ceritinib arm compared to the chemotherapy arm, i.e. 72.5% (95% CI 
65.5, 78.7) ceritinib vs 26.7%(95% CI 20.5, 33.7) chemotherapy. Investigator-based ORR revealed similar 
results. 
Tumour responses were durable; the median DOR per BIRC assessment was longer in patients treated with 
ceritinib (23.9 months; 95% CI: 16.6, NE) compared to patients treated with chemotherapy (11.1 months; 
95% CI: 7.8, 16.4). 
Intracranial response: In patients with measurable disease in the brain at baseline, ceritinib led to a greater 
improvement in OIRR than chemotherapy; 72.7% (95% CI: 49.8, 89.3, n= 16) vs. 27.3% (95% CI: 10.7, 
50.2, n=6). Corresponding figures for those with measurable and/or non-measurable brain metastases were 
46.3% (95% CI: 32.6, 60.4, n=25) vs. 21.2% (95% CI: 11.1, 34.7, n=11). The same trend was seen in 
those  with  and  without  prior  radiotherapy.  Additionally,  in  patients  with  measurable  or  non-measurable 
disease in the brain at baseline, a total of 11 patients in the ceritinib arm and 7 in the chemotherapy arm had 
CRs.  
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The superiority in progression free survival is expected to translate into a longer survival in patients treated 
with ceritinib in first line. However, despite the positive trend observed in the interim analysis OS (HR 0.73 
95% CI: 0.50, 1.08;p=0.056), results did not reach statistical significance at the pre-specified one sided 
significance level of 0.0006. However, due to switch to subsequent anti-neoplastic therapies (109 out of 175 
patients  in  ceritinib  and  60%  in  the  chemotherapy  arm  treated  with  ALK  inhibitors  after  progression 
(crizotinib in 23 patients), statistically significant differences in the final OS analysis are not expected, which 
raises questions about the tumour’s drug resistance. Further, PFS2 data is lacking and the impact of ceritinib 
on next line therapies remains unknown. In this regard, biopsies collected from patients that were enrolled 
in the trial, and consented, will be used for additional exploratory biomarker assessments and to explore 
acquired resistance to ceritinib. These studies will be carried out firstly on a genetic based approach. The 
results from these exploratory biomarker analyses will be submitted when available. 
PROs questionnaires were completed by 80% of patients, overall in the majority of the time-points of the 
trial (Day 1 of each cycle). Results highlighted an improvement in overall health status over chemotherapy. 
However, due to the open-label design, and exploratory nature of these analyses, these results should be 
interpreted with caution. 
Patients with WHO PS 2 were limited to around 6% of the total studied population. Efficacy data in terms of 
ORR seem comparable to those patients with a better performance status. Conversely, the duration of the 
response  and  the  PFS  are  shorter  in  this  subpopulation,  slightly  superior  to  chemotherapy  though 
significantly inferior to WHO PS 0-1 ceritinib subsets.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety review is based primarily on the results of the Phase III Study A2301, comprising of 364 patients 
among  whom  all  189  randomized  patients  received  ceritinib  750  mg  once  daily  and  175/187  patients 
received chemotherapy. 
The most frequently reported AEs regardless of study drug relationship (>25% of patients) in Study A2301 
ceritinib group were: diarrhoea (84.7%), nausea (68.8%), vomiting (66.1%), ALT increased (60.3%), AST 
increased  (52.9%),  GGT  increased  (37.0%),  blood  ALP  increased  (29.1%),  and  decreased  appetite  and 
fatigue (33.9% and 29.1% patients, respectively). The most frequently reported grade 3/4 AEs regardless of 
study drug relationship (> 10% of patients) in the ceritinib group were elevations in liver enzymes - ALT 
increased (30.7%), GGT increased (28.6%), and AST increased (16.9%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/386332/2017 
Page 98/101 
 
  
  
Incidence of AEs leading to discontinuation in Study A2301 ceritinib group and pooled dataset were 11.1% 
and 12.1%, respectively, grade 3-4 in severity were 6.3% and 9.4%, respectively. 
The safety and tolerability profiles of ceritinib remain the same. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Dose interruption and dose reductions for ceritinib occurred over the treatment period, with the highest 
percentage of dose interruption and dose reductions occurring between weeks 3 to 6 of treatment (24.9% 
and 17.5% respectively). In the ceritinib group, the most frequently reported reason for dose interruptions 
was AEs (95.3%), and primarily due to AEs of liver enzyme elevations. The dose reductions were primarily 
due to AEs of liver enzyme elevations and GI AEs. Many patients requiring dose adjustment, interruption or 
reduction. 
Among 152 patients with post-baseline ALT or AST elevation of grade 1 or higher based on laboratory tests 
in study A2301, more than 60% had the first occurrence within the first 6 weeks of treatment and then 25% 
in the next 6 weeks. Considering that most cases are found within the first three months, the SmPC advice 
has been revised to every 2 weeks for the first three months and monthly thereafter to early capture patients 
with elevations.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Results from the ASCEND-4 study are considered robust, since several sensitivity and subgroup analyses 
(including the Per protocol Set) show consistent outcomes.

The benefit observed in terms of antitumour activity (higher and long-lasting responses) and the delay in 
disease progression in patients with NSCLC with ALK rearrangement is considered clinically meaningful. The 
median  8  months  gain  in  PFS  is  highly  clinically  relevant.  Survival  results  also  favour  ceritinib,  which  is 
reassuring, but due to the high cross-over to subsequent effective therapies, results did not reach statistical 
significance.  
The use of chemotherapy as comparator, even though is appropriate from a regulatory perspective since it 
was considered SoC at the time of the initiation of the study, is not the most adequate from the current 
clinical  perspective,  where  the  use  of  ALK  inhibitors  in  frontline  is  widely  accepted  in  patients  with  ALK 
rearrangement. Nonetheless, the results from study 1014 with crizotinib appear comparable to the ceritinib 
outcomes from study A2301.  
Given the high prevalence of brain metastases in ALK-positive advanced NSCLC patients (around 50%) and 
the  low  bioavailability  of  crizotinib  (the  only  ALK  inhibitor  currently  approved  as  first-line  therapy  in 
ALK-positive patients with advanced NSCLC) in the cerebrospinal fluid, the promising intracerebral efficacy 
results of ceritinib over chemotherapy is considered of added clinical value. 
The safety of ceritinib seems acceptable and manageable.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The evidence provided in support of the efficacy of ceritinib in the first line treatment of NSCLC patients with 
ALK rearrangement is considered robust and the differences observed over chemotherapy treatment are 
deemed clinically relevant. The effect is consistent with what has been observed with other ALK inhibitors in 
the same class of products. The benefits associated to ceritinib outweigh the toxicity and ADRs observed 
with the treatment, which are considered well known and overall manageable.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit risk balance of Zykadia is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change: 
Variation accepted 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition 
Type II 
I and IIIB 
of a new therapeutic indication or modification of an 
approved one  
Extension of Indication to include new indication/population for Zykadia as first-line treatment of adult 
patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC); as 
a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated to reflect the 
information based primarily on the supporting study, CLDK378A2301 (ASCEND-4). The Package Leaflet is 
updated in accordance. The Risk Management Plan version 10.0 was agreed. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan.

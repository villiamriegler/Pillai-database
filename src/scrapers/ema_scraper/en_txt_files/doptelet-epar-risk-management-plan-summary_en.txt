SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR DOPTELET® 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Doptelet 20 mg film coated tablets.  
The RMP details important risks of Doptelet, how these risks can be minimised and how more 
information will be obtained about Doptelet’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Doptelet’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Doptelet should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Doptelet should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of 
which are part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Doptelet’s RMP. 
I 
The Medicine and What it is Used for 
Doptelet is authorised for the treatment of severe thrombocytopenia in adult patients with 
chronic liver disease who are scheduled to undergo an invasive procedure.  Doptelet is also 
authorised for the treatment of primary chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) in adult 
patients who are refractory to other treatments (e.g. corticosteroids, immunoglobulins). It 
contains avatrombopag as the active substance and it is given by oral administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of Doptelet’s benefits can be found in the EPAR for 
Doptelet, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) website under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.eurpa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/doptelet. 
II 
or Further Characterise the Risks  
Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise 
Important risks of Doptelet, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Doptelet’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size – the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that 
the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status – the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed including Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) assessment so that 
immediate action can be taken, as necessary.  These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Doptelet is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A 
List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Doptelet are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken.  Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Doptelet.  Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation.  Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

Additional pharmacovigilance 
activities 
As a class, TPO receptor agonists stimulate the production of 
endogenous platelets, and thus may increase the risk of occurrence of 
thrombotic / thromboembolic events. In addition, patients with chronic 
liver disease (CLD) and immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) are also 
known to be at increased risk for occurrence of these events. 
In the clinical development program, 7.0% (9/128) of patients with 
chronic ITP who were treated with avatrombopag experienced a 
thromboembolic event. With the exception of cerebrovascular accident 
which was reported in 1.6% (2/128) patients, there was no clustering of 
a specific thromboembolic event type, the time to onset varied from 
greater than 26 weeks to less than 4 weeks after beginning treatment, 
there was no relationship to drug dose, and the events typically occurred 
at a platelet count below the upper limit of normal (450,000/µL). In 
patients with CLD, 0.4% (1/274) experienced a thromboembolic event. 
Avatrombopag was not studied in patients with prior thromboembolic 
events. Patients with chronic liver disease or chronic immune 
thrombocytopenia are at increased risk for thrombotic / thromboembolic 
events as a comorbidity.  Additional risk factors include a history of 
deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, superficial vein 
thrombosis, stroke/other neurological disorders associated with 
paralysis, immobilization >3 days, increasing age, pregnancy and 
puerperium (<8 weeks from delivery), cancer, cancer therapy, 
contraceptives, obesity, smoking, acute myocardial infarction and heart 
failure, fractures, oestrogen intake, surgery/trauma, or genetic 
prothrombotic conditions (Factor V Leiden, Prothrombin 20210A, 
Antithrombin deficiency or Protein C or S deficiency).

Bone Marrow Fibrosis Related to Long-Term and Repeat Use 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
With  long-term  use,  thrombopoietin  receptor  agonists  (TPO-RAs)  may 
increase the risk of development or progression of reticulin fibres/fibrosis 
within the bone marrow.  The clinical importance of this observation is 
unknown. 
incompletely  understood,  however 
The  pathophysiology  remains 
increased bone marrow reticulin is believed to be a result of TPO receptor 
stimulation,  leading  to  an  increased  number  of  megakaryocytes  in  the 
bone  marrow,  which  may  subsequently  release  cytokines.  Cytokines 
appear to be necessary for fibrosis to occur. 
Avatrombopag,  a  TPO-RA,  requires  chronic  dosing  for  use  in  patients 
with ITP and may pose a risk for the development of or progression of 
reticulin  fibres/fibrosis  within  the  bone  marrow.  In  the  clinical 
development  programme,  1  of  128  (<1%)  ITP  patients  was  treated 
initially  with  eltrombopag  for  56  days,  followed  by  avatrombopag 
treatment for 161 days.  Thirty-one days after avatrombopag therapy was 
discontinued,  a  bone  marrow  biopsy  showed  a  bone  marrow  reticulin 
fibrosis of 2+ with focal areas of 3+. This patient also had a pre-treatment 
elevated bone marrow reticulin fibrosis (1+). 
For patients with CLD who undergo multiple procedures, avatrombopag 
may also be prescribed before each procedure is performed, but 
experience with repeat use is limited. 
No specific risk factor has been identified in clinical trials.  
Risk groups include patients on long-term treatment with TPO-R 
agonists, those undergoing multiple procedures, or patients with 
myeloproliferative disease or other hematologic and nonhematologic 
malignant neoplasms, autoimmune disorders, or endocrine disorders.

Hepatic worsening function in patients with Child-Pugh Class C  
Important Potential Risks 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Across the clinical development programme, a total of four fatal adverse 
events were reported, with three deaths occurring in the avatrombopag 
treatment group and one death in the placebo treatment group. All 
reported deaths in the avatrombopag group occurred in patients who had 
Child-Pugh class C liver disease, whereas no deaths in patients with 
Child-Pugh class C were reported in the placebo arm.  It is possible that 
the fatal outcomes of hepatic coma and multi-organ failure (acute liver 
failure, acute kidney injury and respiratory failure) are associated with 
the natural progression of the underlying disease. 
Patients with Child-Pugh class C who receive treatment with 
avatrombopag; patients with bacterial infections/sepsis, GI bleeding, 
alcohol intake, drug toxicity, surgery. Hepatocellular carcinoma, or viral 
hepatitis.

See section II.C of this summary for an overview of the post-
authorisation development plan. 
Given that some haematopoietic cancers express the thrombopoietin 
(TPO) receptors, it is theorized that administration of TPO-RAs, due to 
their mechanism of action, may further potentiate the risk of 
haematological malignancy in ITP patients. However, epidemiologic 
studies also suggest a possible association between ITP and 
haematological malignancy (Landgren, 2006; Söderberg, 2006).   
Risk groups include patients on long-term treatment with TPO-R 
agonists, those undergoing multiple procedures who receive repeat 
dosing with a TPO-R agonist, or patients with myeloproliferative 
disease or other hematologic and nonhematologic malignant neoplasms, 
autoimmune disorders, or endocrine disorders.

Other Studies in Post-authorisation Development Plan 
II.C.2.1  Chronic liver disease 
Study short name:  Hepatic safety of avatrombopag in patients with Child Pugh class C liver 
disease or MELD scores > 24. 
Purpose of the study:  The primary objective of this study is to assess any potential for 
hepatic worsening function in Child Pugh class C liver disease patients, and to collect further 
safety information on patients with MELD scores > 24 who receive treatment with 
avatrombopag.  A secondary objective is to assess ‘other safety data’ based on findings from 
the avatrombopag clinical development programme.  
II.C.2.2  Primary chronic immune thrombocytopenia 
Study short name:  Further characterisation of the safety profile of avatrombopag in patients 
with primary chronic immune thrombocytopenia. 
Purpose of the study:  Due to the low number of patients enroled in the clinical development 
programme, coupled with the limited safety from long-term exposure to avatrombopag, there 
is uncertainly with regards to the frequency in occurrence of various adverse events in the 
target population.  Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to further characterise the 
long-term safety profile of avatrombopag in patients with primary chronic immune 
thrombocytopenia

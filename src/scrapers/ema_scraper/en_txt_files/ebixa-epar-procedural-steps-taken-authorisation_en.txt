Steps taken for the assessment of the product 
The procedure started on 22 October 2001 
This  application  forms  part  of  a  multiple  application  for  the  product  Memantine  in  the 
indication  “Treatment  of  patients  with  moderately  severe  to  severe  Alzheimer's  disease”.    The 
initial application was  submitted by Merz + Co. GmbH & Co (EMEA/H/C/378).  The review 
process  for  both  applications  has  been  integrated,  allowing  the  opinion  to  be  adopted  in  the 
same timeframe as EMEA/H/C/378 (See Annexes 1-5).  
During the CPMP meeting on 15-17 January 2002, outstanding issues adopted at the November 
2001 CPMP meeting, were addressed by the applicant during a hearing before the CPMP. 
During  the  meeting  on  19-21  February  2002  the  CPMP,  in  the  light  of  the  overall  data 
submitted  and  the  scientific  discussion  within  the  Committee,  issued  a  positive  opinion  for 
granting a Marketing Authorisation to Ebixa on 21 February 2001. 
The  CPMP  opinions  were  forwarded,  in  all  official  languages  of  the  European  Union,  to  the 
European Commission, which adopted the corresponding Decisions on 15 May 2002.

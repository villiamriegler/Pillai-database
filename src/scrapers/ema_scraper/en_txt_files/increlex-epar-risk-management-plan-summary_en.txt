Summary of risk management plan for Increlex (mecasermin) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Increlex. The RMP details important 
risks of Increlex, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained 
about Increlex 's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Increlex's  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and  its  package  leaflet  give  essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Increlex should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Increlex should be read in the context of all this information including 
the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part of  the 
European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or  changes to the current ones  will be included in updates of Increlex's 
RMP. 
I. 
The Medicine and What it is Used For 
Increlex is authorised for long-term treatment of growth failure in children and adolescents from 2 
to 18 years with severe primary insulin-like growth factor-1 deficiency (primary IGFD; see SmPC 
for  the  full  indication).  It  contains  mecasermin  as  the  active  substance  and  it  is  given  by 
subcutaneous injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of Increlex’s benefits can be found in Increlex’s EPAR, 
including  in  its  plain-language  summary,  available  on  the  EMA  website,  under  the  medicine’s 
webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/medicines/human/EPAR/increlex 
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise 
II. 
the risk 
Important risks of Increlex, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Increlex's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
• 
Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the package 
leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the 
medicine is used correctly; 
The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or without 
prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
• 
• 
• 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of Increlex, these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimisation measures 
mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
 
 
 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. 
These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Increlex is not yet available, it is listed under 
‘missing information’ below. 
II.A  List of important risks and missing information 
Important  risks  of  Increlex  are  risks  that  need  special  risk  management  activities  to  further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important 
risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential.  Identified  risks  are  concerns  for  which  there  is 
sufficient  proof  of  a  link  with  the  use  of  Increlex.  Potential  risks  are  concerns  for  which  an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has 
not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on 
the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the 
long-term use of the medicine).

II.B  Summary of important risks 
Important identified risk - Hypoglycaemia 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
The evidence for the classification of this risk comes from exposure in the 
clinical development programme and in the postmarketing setting. 
Hypoglycaemia occurred very commonly (≥1/10) in the clinical development 
programme and has also been observed in the postmarketing setting. 
Risk factors and risk groups Younger age group, severity of short stature and a previous history of 
spontaneous hypoglycaemia are considered risk factors for hypoglycaemia in 
patients on IGF therapy based on an analysis of 62 treatment-naïve subjects 
with IGF-I deficiency due to GH insensitivity treated for at least 1 year with 
rhIGF-I.  In the EU Increlex Registry, predictive factors for hypoglycaemia 
were presence of Laron Syndrome at treatment initiation and history of 
hypoglycaemia at treatment initiation (p=0.001 and p=0.041, respectively).

Lipohypertrophy occurred uncommonly (≥ 1/1000, <1/100) in the 
clinical development programme overall, but occurred at a frequency 
of 35% in Study 1419 and has also been observed in the postmarketing 
setting. Additionally, it has been noted as a frequent event associated 
with IGF-1 therapy in the published literature . 
A clinical study in which 430 outpatients injecting insulin filled in a 
questionnaire regarding their injection technique before examination 
of their injection sites for the presence of hypertrophy found that 
failure to rotate injection sites and use of needles more than five times 
(i.e. reuse of needles) were risk factors for lipohypertrophy.

hypertension was reported in the clinical development programme, albeit 
uncommonly (≥1/1000, <1/100), and has also been observed in the 
postmarketing setting. In addition, intracranial hypertension has been reported 
in association with IGF-1 treatment in the published literature . 
In a review of paediatric idiopathic intracranial hypertension by Rangwala and 
Liu, various risk factors for developing idiopathic intracranial hypertension are 
discussed. However, the risk factor profile is not well understood and may 
differ between young children and adolescents or adults.  No specific risk 
groups or risk factors for intracranial hypertension attributable to rhIGF-1 
therapy have been identified.

Hypersensitivity (either systemic and/or local to the injection site) occurred in 
8% of subjects in the clinical development programme and has also been 
observed in the postmarketing setting. 
Subjects with a congenital protein deficiency are less likely to recognise a 
therapeutic protein as “self” and are therefore more likely to mount an immune 
response. In the context of mecasermin therapy, patients who produce no IGF-1 
of their own are more likely to generate antibodies towards rhIGF-1 as the 
protein is more likely to be recognised as foreign. Patients who are atopic 
and/or who have underlying allergic conditions, such as eczema, asthma and 
allergic rhinitis, are considered to be at increased risk of anaphylaxis.

have been some cases reported from solicited and clinical trials sources since 
marketing approval. 
No specific risk groups or risk factors for scoliosis attributable to rhIGF-1 
therapy have been identified. However, established biological risk factors are 
growth velocity and potential residual spinal growth.

Risk minimisation 
measures 
Cardiomegaly is considered to be an Important identified risk based on the fact 
that the published literature suggests IGF-1 may lead to increased myocyte 
mass and volume  together with the fact that some cases of cardiomegaly were 
observed in clinical studies, albeit uncommonly (≥1/1000, <1/100). 
Cardiomegaly is not considered to be associated with untreated severe IGFD. 
Genetic aetiology accounts for about one half of presumed sporadic cases and 
nearly two thirds of familial cases of childhood onset cardiac hypertrophy. 
Increased cardiac mortality is seen in GH and IGF-1 deficient states and animal 
studies suggest protection of cardiac myocytes by IGF-1.  
No specific risk groups or risk factors for cardiomegaly attributable to rhIGF-1 
therapy have been identified.

The evidence for the classification of this risk comes from exposure in the clinical 
development programme and in the postmarketing setting. IGF-1 is a growth factor, 
and therefore has the potential to increase the risk of developing neoplasias. 
Melanocytic naevus was a common (≥1/100 to <1/10) event in the clinical 
development programme and has also been observed in the postmarketing setting. 
Additional spontaneous reports of benign and malignant neoplasia have also been 
reported in the postmarketing setting. To date  the frequency of these events is 
unknown. 
Individuals at the high end of the normal range of serum IGF-1 concentration have 
been found to have more than double the risk of developing prostate, breast and 
colorectal cancers than those at the lower end. One suggestion is that higher levels of 
IGF-1 may result in early undetected carcinogenic lesions progressing to clinically 
significant manifestations.  Nevertheless, some review papers refer to other studies 
that have failed to find an association between higher IGF-1 levels and increased risk 
of certain cancers.  However, an association between normalising IGF-1 levels and 
cancer in children treated with rhIGF-1 has not been reported in these publications.

measures 
The evidence for the classification of this risk comes from exposure in the 
clinical development programme. Positive IGF-1 antibody tests were observed 
in a large number of subjects in the clinical studies. Potential clinical 
consequences of immunogenicity are a decrease in mecasermin efficacy, 
allergic reactions and induction of autoimmunity including antibodies to the 
endogenous form of the protein. However, the risk of immunogenicity for 
mecasermin is not yet well established, therefore, Immunogenicity (potential 
reduced effect) is considered to be an important potential risk. 
Subjects with a congenital protein deficiency are less likely to recognise a 
therapeutic protein as “self” and are therefore more likely to mount an immune 
response.  In the context of mecasermin therapy, patients who produce no IGF-
1 of their own are more likely to generate antibodies towards rhIGF-1 as the 
protein is more likely to be recognised as foreign. The immunogenicity of 
biologic agents is influenced by the molecule itself, the route of delivery, the 
degree of exposure, and the simultaneous use of immunosuppressive agents 
during administration, as well as other factors. No specific risk groups or risk 
factors for immunogenicity attributable to rhIGF-1 therapy have been 
identified.

It is known that slipped capital femoral epiphysis can occur in patients who 
experience rapid growth. However, there were no reports of slipped capital 
femoral epiphysis/avascular necrosis in any of the clinical studies and a single 
case in the US Increlex Registry (no cases in the EU Increlex Registry). 
No specific risk groups or risk factors for slipped capital femoral epiphysis 
attributable to rhIGF-1 therapy have been identified. However, established 
biological risk factors are male gender (male to female ratio is approximately 
1.5), race (higher prevalence rate in the black population, Hispanics, 
Polynesians, and Native Americans when compared with Caucasians), 
geographic location (higher rates in the north and western parts of the United 
States).  The age of onset of slipped capital femoral epiphysis is approximately 
12.7 to 13.5 years for boys and 11.2 to 12 years for girls. Obesity may also be a 
risk factor for slipped capital femoral epiphysis as well as certain abnormal 
morphologies of the proximal femur.

Global  Patient  Registry  to  Monitor  Long-term  Safety  and  Effectiveness  of  Increlex®  in 
Children  and  Adolescents  with  Severe  Primary  Insulin-like  Growth  Factor-1  Deficiency 
(SPIGFD) 
Purpose : 
Primary Objective: 
•  To  collect  safety  data  in  children  and  adolescents  receiving  Increlex®  for  the  treatment  of 
SPIGFD. 
Secondary Objectives: 
 
 
 
 
 
•  To  describe  long-term  safety  data,  for  at  least  5  years  after  the  end  of  Increlex®  therapy,  in 
children and adolescents who have received Increlex® therapy, regardless of treatment duration 
and adult height; 
• To describe long-term safety data at 2 and 5 years after the end of Increlex® therapy, for a subset 
of children and adolescents who have been exposed to Increlex® therapy for at least 3 cumulative 
years excluding interruptions, regardless of adult height; 
•  To  describe  Increlex®  effectiveness  throughout  the  study  until  the  participant  reaches  adult 
height; 
•  To  identify  predictive  factors  of  the  main  effectiveness  parameters  by  modelisation  of  height 
velocity,  final  adult  height  (FAH),  height  standard  deviation  score  (SDS)  change,  timing  and 
progression of puberty, bone age development; 
• To evaluate Increlex® therapy exposure and compliance; 
• To assess quality of life (QoL) during Increlex® therapy and in the post-treatment period (using 
EQ-5D version EQ-5D-Y (paediatric questionnaire)); 
•  To  describe  the  timeframe  of  the  occurrence  of  neoplasia  (benign  and  malignant)  and 
hypoglycaemia. 
• To determine the LED defined as the cut-off dose under which there is no further effect on the 
height velocity (short-term evaluation: 1-year height velocity). 
Long-term safety follow-up extension of the Global Increlex Registry (SOB 002) 
Purpose:  
To perform one long-term  safety  study  where  mecasermin  treatment  is  initiated  in the early 
phase of childhood and continued to adulthood in order to investigate: 
•Long-term toxicity in subjects undergoing developmental changes 
•Possible occurrence of malignancies as well as other risks. 
Complementary analysis of data from the Global Increlex Registry to determine the lowest 
effective dose of mecasermin (MEA 020.3(previously FUM 020)) 
Purpose:  
Main effectiveness parameters (height SDS, height velocity) will be described according to average 
dose received over the course of the study and according to dose ranges (i.e. 4 dose ranges (≤50, 
]50-80],  ]80-110],  >  110  μg/kg  BID)).  This  analysis  will  support  the  description  of  the  lowest 
effective dose.

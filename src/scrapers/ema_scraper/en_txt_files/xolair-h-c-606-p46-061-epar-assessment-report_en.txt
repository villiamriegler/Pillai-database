1.  Introduction 
On July 12:th, 2017, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Xolair, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
Novartis has completed a non-interventional post-marketing surveillance study CIGE025A1402 
entitled, “Specified Drug Use survey in all Japanese patients with bronchial asthma receiving Xolair for 
s.c. injection 75 mg/150 mg.” The aim of this study was to collect safety and efficacy data on long-
term use of omalizumab in actual medical practice. This survey was conducted in Japan and registered 
a total of 3,893 patients. 25 patients in the study were children. 
A short critical expert overview written by a Novartis employee has also been provided.

2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
CIGE025A1402 entitled, “Specified Drug Use survey in all Japanese patients with bronchial 
asthma receiving Xolair for s.c. injection 75 mg/150 mg”; last patient last visit on 25-Jan-2017. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
CIGE025A1402  
Description 
Study CIGE025A1402 was a Non Interventional Study conducted in Japanese patients with bronchial 
asthma receiving Xolair 75 mg and 150 mg powder for solution for injection (lyophilized form). The aim 
of this study was to collect safety and efficacy data on long –term use of omalizumab in actual medical 
practice. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The objective of the survey was to collect safety and efficacy data on long-term use of omalizumab in 
actual medical practice, to understand any related issues, and to examine Xolair's suppressive effects 
on exacerbation of asthma.

Study design 
The Drug-Use survey was conducted in the setting of actual clinical practice using a central registration 
system with a 1-year observation period. (A follow-up survey has been conducted to verify whether 
treatment status is continued and to collect information related to AEs of malignant tumor at the 2nd 
and 3rd year in patients continuing Xolair treatment for at least 1 year.) 
The standard observation period (duration of treatment) was 1 year. If no improvement was observed 
in asthma symptoms as the efficacy assessment at Week 16, the treatment with Xolair was 
discontinued and the data of one-year-observation was collected. 
Study population 
The target population for this survey study consisted of patients with poorly controlled bronchial 
asthma with refractory asthma symptoms despite standard of care. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Global evaluations of treatment effectiveness (GETE) 
Adverse events 
Other survey items for which no results are reported by the MAH included; patient characteristics, 
status of Xolair® use, evaluation of continuous treatment/long-term administration, treatment status 
of asthma (from 6 months prior to Xolair treatment to 1 year after the treatment), treatment for 
asthma attack, other concomitant medications, clinical course (asthma symptoms, pulmonary function 
test, events related to asthma exacerbation, concomitant allergic diseases), laboratory values, 
discontinuation/withdrawal. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 3,893 patients participated in this study. Out of the 3,893 patients, Case Report Forms 
(CRFs) were not collected in 220 patients. These missing survey results were due to a variety of 
reasons, including physician’s refusal to complete such survey or changing practice location, among 
others. Therefore the database includes 3,673 patients, of whom 2,123 patients (59%) completed the 
study. 1,497 patients (41%) discontinued prematurely from the study: the most frequent reasons 
recorded for discontinuation were: inadequate response (471/1,497), adverse event (288/1,497) and 
symptom improved (247/1,497). 
In the age group less than 18 years, 26 patients were enrolled and 25 patients were included in the 
safety analysis set (one patient with off-label use which is out of the scope for this survey study was 
removed from safety analysis set). 12 patients discontinued prematurely from the study, however no 
cases of discontinuation were due to safety reasons (“Symptom improved” in 5 patients, “Economic 
reason” in 1 patient, “Lost to follow-up” in 1 patient, “Moving” in 1 patient, “Patient decision” in 1 
patient, and “Other” in 3 patients). 
Efficacy results 
The GETE by physicians using a 5-grade scale were evaluated at each time point and at final 
evaluation. Patients who discontinued treatment < 2 months after initiation, and for whom GETE was 
not collected at discontinuation were not included in the tabulation for GETE, because there were no

usable data for them. As a result, GETE was analyzed for 3,585 patients in the entire population. The 
evaluations at the final observation were “Excellent” in 15% (553/3,585), “Good” in 34% 
(1,222/3,585), “Moderate” in 24% (860/3,585), “Poor” in 18% (660/3,585) and “Worsening” in 3% 
(114/3,585). The effectiveness rate was calculated by defining those with scores of either “Excellent” 
or “Good” as being considered “effective” was 50% (1,775/3,585). 
In the patient group aged less than 18 years, the evaluations at the final observation were “Excellent” 
in 44% (11/25), “Good” in 28% (7/25), “Moderate” in 20% (5/25), “Poor” in 4% (1/25) and “No 
Worsening” case. The effectiveness rate in the patient group aged less than 18 years was 72% 
(18/25). Due to the small number of patients in the age group less than 18 years there are no other 
subgroup efficacy data in these patients. 
Safety results 
In the entire study population, the most frequently reported AEs were asthma (11%), nasopharyngitis 
(5%), pneumonia (2%), and bronchitis (2%). Adverse drug reactions (ADRs: AEs suspected to be 
related to Xolair) were reported in 292 patients (8%).  
There were no ADRs with an incidence > 1%. The most frequently reported ADRs were malaise 
(0.9%), urticaria (0.7%), dizziness (0.5%), pyrexia (0.5%), and rash (0.5%) which are expected to 
occur due to administration of Xolair. 
The frequently reported (> 1%) SAEs were asthma (10%) and pneumonia (1.6%). SAEs suspected to 
be related to Xolair were reported in 36 patients, and the most common of these SAEs were 
anaphylactic reaction (4), asthma (3), muscular weakness (3), hypersensitivity (2), and nausea (2). 
A total of 62 death cases out of 3,620 cases were reported in this study. The most common causes of 
death cases included: pneumonia (14 deaths) followed by asthma (8 deaths), cardiac failure acute (5 
deaths), and sepsis, death (cause unknown), and myocardial infarction (3 deaths). All death cases 
were reported by the investigator as not suspected to be related to Xolair except two cases: 
myocardial infarction and uterine cancer (see below summary). 
Myocardial infarction (75 year old, female): Patient had a medical history of eosinophilic 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA), conjunctivitis allergic, dementia, hypertension, and trigeminal 
neuralgia. The patient suffered from a myocardial infarction 5 months after the start of Xolair 
treatment and died. The physician assessed the causality with Xolair for myocardial infarction as 
uncertain. 
MAH’s assessment: The patient has concurrent allergic granulomatous angiitis/ eosinophilic 
granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). In the last stage of EGPA (vasculitis), the most serious 
complication of the vasculitic stage is heart disease, which is the cause of nearly half of all deaths in 
patients with EGPA. Among heart disease-related deaths, the most usual cause is inflammation of the 
heart muscle caused by the high level of eosinophils, although some are deaths due to inflammation of 
the arteries that supply blood to the heart or pericardial tamponade. Blood clots may develop within 
the damaged arteries in severe cases, which are followed by infarction and cell death, or slow atrophy. 
Therefore MAH considered this case as confounded by EGPA. 
Uterine cancer (71 year old, female): Patient had a medical history of rheumatoid arthritis (Enbrel, 
Rheumatrex, and Prednisolone for about 2 years), osteoporosis (Bonalon for about 2 years) and rhinitis 
allergic. Uterine cancer (Stage IIIB) was diagnosed 9 months after start of Xolair treatment. The 
patient died 5 months after the diagnosis was made. The physician assessed the causality with Xolair 
for uterine cancer as “uncertain”.

MAH’s assessment: Time-to-onset between Xolair start and uterine cancer diagnosis is 9 months, a 
time frame which is not plausible for solid tumors. It should be noted that the patient additionally was 
being treated for 2 years with Etanercept, a drug which is associated with an increased risk of 
malignancies. Considering this information, the MAH assessed this case as being confounded by 
etanercept. 
In the age group less than 18 years, AEs were reported in 8 patients. The most common event was 
nasopharyngitis (3 cases). In the patient group aged less than 18 years, ADRs were reported in 2 
patients (1 episode each of headache, rash generalized, and menstruation irregular), all non-serious 
events. An SAE of “asthma” requiring hospitalization was reported in one patient. No death cases were 
reported in this age group.

These safety findings are in line with the known and well defined safety profile of Xolair. No new safety 
findings were identified in either the entire population or in the pediatric population. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The results of this trial raised no new safety concerns and do not change the overall risk/benefit profile 
of Xolair® (omalizumab). There are no proposed changes to the existing Product information.

2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion on the orphan medicinal product designation was based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to 
be affecting between 2.2 and 2.9 in 10,000 persons in the Community, at the time the application 
was made; 
the condition is life-threatening, in particular due to the risk of severe neurological impairment, 
cardiac and renal manifestations; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the 
Community, sufficient justification has been provided that containing nanobody directed towards 
the human A1 domain of von Willebrand factor may be of significant benefit to those affected by 
the condition. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is an autoimmune blood clotting disorder manifested by 
microvascular occlusions and consequent thrombocytopenia, haemolytic anaemia, and organ ischemia.  
Acquired TTP is caused by inhibitory autoantibodies to ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease 
with thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13, resulting in a severe deficiency in this von Willebrand 
Factor-cleaving protease. Decreased ADAMTS13 activity leads to an accumulation of ultra‑large (or 
unusually large) von Willebrand factor multimers which bind to platelets and induce aggregation. 
The approved therapeutic indication “Cablivi is indicated for the treatment of adults experiencing an 
episode of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP), in conjunction with plasma 
exchange and immunosuppression” falls within the scope of the designated orphan indication 
“treatment of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
Based on the CHMP assessment, the intention to treat the condition has been justified (reference is 
made to the European public assessment report of Cablivi). 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
At the time of initial designation, the COMP agreed that the condition was chronically debilitating and 
life-threatening. At the time of this review TTP is presented to remain seriously debilitating and life 
threatening disease with a mortality of 10-20% following acute episodes and significant long-term 
morbidity and mortality. Patients have decreased cognitive function and increased prevalence of 
hypertension, systemic lupus erythematosus, major depression, and albuminuria. No new therapies

Page 4/9 
 
 
 
have been approved in this condition, and the mortality rate has remained unchanged since the initial 
orphan designation of Cablivi.  
The COMP concluded that the condition remains life threatening and chronically debilitating due to the 
risk of severe neurological impairment, cardiac and renal manifestations. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
At the time of designation the prevalence was agreed to be between 2.2 and 2.9 per 10,000. For the 
orphan maintenance, the prevalence was estimated to be 2.2 per 10,000 and remaining less than 5 
per 10,000.  
No systematic literature search was conducted, but epidemiological data on TTP were identified from 
TTP registries (UK), dedicated epidemiological studies on TTP (questionnaires or review of medical 
records in Spain, The Netherlands), and apheresis registries (Hungary, Norway, Sweden, Italy, France) 
(summarised in table 1). The incidence rate in Europe of TTP was estimated to 0.72 per 10,000, based 
on the highest identified incidence figure from the UK.

To calculate prevalence from incidence, the sponsor uses the formula P=I*D, where incidence is 
multiplied with disease duration. In this context, a distinction is made between patients with relapse 
and without relapse. The scientific literature reports on relapse rates for patients with aTTP ranging 
between 11% and 50%. The final prevalence calculation therefore incorporates a 50% relapse rate 
using a modified formula: prevalence= [incidence x EU population x fraction of patients who are not 
expected to  relapse] + [incidence x duration (remaining life span) x EU population x fraction persons 
expect to relapse]. Incidence was used for patients without relapse. Relapsing patients were estimated 
to have a disease duration of 60 years. This is considered to be a conservative estimate considering 
the mean age of diagnosis at 43 years of age.  
Based on these calculations, the prevalence of TTP was estimated to be 2.2 (0.036 + 2.16) per 
10,000. The COMP accepted this prevalence figure for the maintenance of orphan designation. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition.

Existing methods 
There are no medicinal products authorised in the EU for the treatment of TTP. 
There is a UK guideline on diagnosis and management of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and 
other thrombotic microangiopathies (Scully et al., Br J Haematol. 2012 Aug;158(3):323-35). Outlined 
treatment options of acute TTP include plasma exchange and off-label use of immunosuppressants 
such as steroids and – in severe and relapsed cases – rituximab.  
Plasma exchange (PE) removes ultra-large (or unusually large) von Willebrand factor and the 
circulating autoantibodies against ADAMTS13 and replenishes blood levels of von Willebrand Factor -
cleaving protease. PE has reduced mortality rates from over 90% to 10–20% and a delay in initiation 
of PE leads to preventable early mortality. Hence, the COMP re-confirmed its opinion that PE exchange 
remains a satisfactory method and a demonstration of significant benefit needs to be provided.   
Significant benefit 
Two clinical studies have been presented to support significant benefit over PE.  
Study ALX-0681-2.1/10 was a phase II, single-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial to study the 
efficacy and safety of Cablivi (caplacizumab) administered as adjunctive treatment to patients with 
acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. Treatment was given on top of standard of care 
consisting of PE and adjunctive immunosuppressive treatment (e.g., corticosteroids, rituximab), 
antiplatelet agents (e.g., aspirin), supportive therapy with red cell transfusion or folate 
supplementation and treatment with vincristine or cyclosporin in case of refractory TTP. The first study 
drug administration was as an i.v. bolus within 6 hours to 15 minutes prior to initiation of the first on-
study PE or the second PE session (if the subject was randomised after a single PE session). The first 
on-study PE was followed by s.c. administration of study drug within 30 minutes after the end of the 
PE procedure. Subsequently, daily s.c. administrations of 10 mg Cablivi or placebo in adult subjects 
followed each PE session for the duration of PE (including tapering and PE given for exacerbations) and 
once daily for 30 days following the last PE, including tapering.  
The primary endpoint was time to recovery of platelets (≥ 150,000/μL), confirmed at 48 hours after 
the initial reporting of platelet recovery by a de novo measure of platelets ≥ 150,000/μL and LDH 
≤ 2 x ULN. Seventy-five patients were randomised: 36 to the Cablivi group and 39 to the placebo 
group. The number and proportion of subjects in each treatment group with PE tapering were similar in 
the Cablivi treatment group compared with the placebo treatment group (11 [30.6%] subjects versus 
11 [28.2%] subjects). The primary endpoint was met with a reduction in median days 2.97 versus 
4.79 (p-value=0.005, figure 1 and table 2).

ALX0681-C301 (Hercules) study was a phase III double-blind, randomised, parallel group, multicentre 
placebo-controlled trial to study the efficacy and safety of Cablivi in adults with a clinical diagnosis of 
acquired TTP who required initiation of daily PE treatment. All patients received 30 days treatment with 
study drug. The primary endpoint was time to platelet count response defined as initial platelet count ≥ 
150×109/L with subsequent stop of daily PE within 5 days. The effect of treatment with Cablivi on a 
composite endpoint of TTP-related mortality, recurrence of TTP and major thromboembolic events 
during study drug treatment and on endpoints assessing recurrence of TTP during the Overall Study 
Period, refractory TTP and time to normalisation of organ damage marker levels, were evaluated.  
A total of 145 subjects (72 subjects to Cablivi and 73 subjects to placebo) were enrolled (i.e., 
randomised) in the study. 71 subjects in the Cablivi group and 73 in the placebo group received at 
least one dose of study drug and were included in the Safety Population and in the mITT population. 
Based on 66 events in each arm time to confirmed platelet response was statistically significantly 
shorter in the Cablivi arm, p=0.0099, with a HR of 1.55 (1.095; 2.195) (table 3 and figure 2). Opposed 
to the phase II study, patients were required to have received one PE treatment before randomisation, 
which likely contributed to the shorter times to platelet response observed in the phase III study. 
Regarding key secondary endpoints, treatment with Cablivi resulted in a 74% reduction in the 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report

composite endpoint of the percentage of patients with aTTP-related death (0/72; placebo 3/73), 
exacerbation of aTTP (3/72; placebo 28/73), or at least one major thromboembolic event during study 
drug treatment (6/72; placebo 6/73) (p<0.0001), and in a 67% reduction of  the proportion of 
subjects with a recurrence of aTTP (9/72; placebo 28/73) in the overall study period (p<0.001). Of 
further interest for significant benefit over plasma exchange, Cablivi treatment reduced the mean 
number of days of PE, the volume of plasma used, the mean length of Intensive Care Unit stay and the 
mean length of hospitalization during the study drug treatment period.

Figure 2.  Study ALX0681-C301 (Hercules): Time to confirmed platelet response curves (ITT 
population) 
In conclusion, the design of both clinical studies allow for the establishment of the efficacy of Cablivi on 
top of best standard of care including PE. The results of the clinical trials confirm a significant benefit of 
Cablivi over PE on the grounds of a clinically relevant advantage.

4.  COMP position adopted on 19 July 2018 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan indication of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) 
was estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded in to be 2.2 in 10,000 persons in 
the European Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is life threatening and chronically debilitating due to the risk of severe neurological 
impairment, cardiac and renal manifestations; 
although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in the European 
Union, Cablivi is of significant benefit to adults experiencing an episode of acquired thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP), in conjunction with plasma exchange and immunosuppression. 
It was demonstrated that treatment with Cablivi on top of plasma exchange led to a statistically 
significantly shorter time to confirmed platelet response when compared to plasma exchange with 
placebo. There was also a reduction in the composite endpoint of the percentage of patients with 
aTTP-related death, exacerbation of aTTP or at least one major thromboembolic event during study 
drug treatment. The Committee concluded that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Cablivi, nanobody directed 
towards the human A1 domain of von Willebrand factor, caplacizumab, EU/3/09/629 for treatment of 
thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura is not removed from the Community Register of Orphan 
Medicinal Products.

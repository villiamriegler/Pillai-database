are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

these 4 subjects also had Q80K at baseline and at the time 
of failure. Twelve of 13 virologic failures had one or more 
NS5A polymorphisms detected at signature amino acid 
positions (M28V/T, Q30E/H/N/R, L31M/V, H58D, E62D/Q,

Considering that the GT3 cirrhotic population is considered

subjects with compensated cirrhosis and HCV GT3 
infection, from 12 to 8 weeks, based on second 
interim results from study M16-135: A Single Arm, 
Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety 
of Glecaprevir (GLE)/Pibrentasvir (PIB) in Treatment 
Naïve Adults with Chronic Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) 
nowadays as the more difficult to treat population, it is 
crucial to confirm that shortening the Maviret treatment 
duration to 8 weeks in these patients would not be 
detrimental, notwithstanding that there is now retreatment 
option for those patients. In this study, all but 3 GT3 
patient achieved SVR12 (60/63=95.2%). Only 1 GT3 
patient had virological failure (relapse by W4). The patient

Three GT3b TN subjects experienced relapse and two GT3b

study M16-127 (EXPEDITION-5), a multicentre, 
open-label study to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir in renally-impaired adults 
with chronic hepatitis C virus genotype 1-6 infection. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
data from 101 patients with renal impairment from study 
M16-127 (EXPEDITION-5) who were treated according to 
the product information recommendations. Subjects were 
either treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced to 
combinations of (peg) interferon, ribavirin, and/or 
sofosbuvir and received Maviret for 8, 12, or 16 weeks per 
approved treatment durations. Of the 101 subjects treated, 
the median age was 58 years (range 32-87); 53% had HCV 
genotype 1; 27% had HCV genotype 2; 15% had HCV 
genotype 3; 4% had HCV genotype 4; 59% were male; 
73% were White; 80% were HCV treatment-naïve; 13% 
had cirrhosis and 65% had a baseline fibrosis state of F0 or 
F1; 7% were CKD stage 3b; 17% were CKD Stage 4, and 
76% were CKD Stage 5 (all receiving dialysis); 84 subjects 
received 8 weeks of treatment, 13 subjects received 12 
weeks of treatment, and 4 subjects received 16 weeks of 
treatment. The overall SVR12 rate was 97% (98/101). 
There were no virologic failures. The most common adverse 
reaction in subjects with severe renal impairment was 
pruritus (14.9%).

Maviret in liver or kidney transplant patients, based 
on new clinical data from study M13-596

evaluated the efficacy and safety of the 
glecaprevir/pibrentasvir regimen in adult subjects

100 post-liver or -kidney transplant recipients with 
genotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 chronic HCV infection without 
cirrhosis (MAGELLAN-2). The overall safety profile in 
transplant recipients was comparable to that observed in 
subjects in the Phase 2 and 3 studies. Adverse reactions 
observed in greater than or equal to 5% of subjects 
receiving Maviret for 12 weeks were headache (17%), 
fatigue (16%), nausea (8%) and pruritus (7%). The overall 
SVR12 rate in post-transplant subjects was 98.0% 
(98/100). There was one relapse and no on-treatment 
virologic failure. The data also indicated that the current 
recommendations regarding co-administration of Maviret 
with immunosuppressants (ciclosporin ≤100 mg/day, 
tacrolimus, sirolimus, everolimus, azathioprine, 
mycophenolic acid, prednisone, and prednisolone) are 
appropriate. The Package Leaflet has been updated 
accordingly.

The overall safety profile in HCV/HIV-1 co-infected subjects 
to add information on clinical efficacy and safety in 
HCV/HIV-1 co-infected subjects, based on new 
clinical data from Study M14-730 (EXPEDITION-2), a 
post-registrational Phase 3 study which evaluated 
the efficacy and safety of the glecaprevir/pibrentasvir 
regimen in chronic HCV GT1-GT6/HIV-1 co-infected 
subjects who were HCV treatment-naïve or 
treatment-experienced. In addition, the SmPC was 
revised to make minor grammatical and formatting 
amendments and to correct errors in section 5.2. 
(ENDURANCE-1 and EXPEDITION-2) was comparable to 
that observed in HCV mono-infected subjects. Regarding 
efficacy, 97.5% (1,252/1,284) of treatment-naïve (TN) 
subjects or treatment-experienced to combinations of 
interferon, peginterferon, ribavirin and/or sofosbuvir (TE-
PRS) subjects who received the recommended duration  
achieved SVR12 overall, while 0.3% (4/1,284) experienced 
on-treatment virologic failure and 0.9% (11/1,262) 
experienced post-treatment relapse. The presence of HIV-1 
co-infection did not impact efficacy. The SVR12 rate in TN

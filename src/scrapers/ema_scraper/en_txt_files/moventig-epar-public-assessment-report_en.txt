2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Opioid analgesics are the mainstay in the treatment of moderate-to-severe pain (Camilleri 2011, Holzer 
2007, WHO 1996); however, their use is frequently associated with adverse effects, the most common 
and debilitating being OIC (Holzer 2007). Opioids stimulate nonpropulsive activity, increase the 
constrictive tone of sphincters and decrease secretion of fluids in the gastrointestinal tract. The decrease 
in content propulsion results in prolonged transit time and increased contact time, increasing fluid 
absorption. The resulting accumulation of hard, dry stool is the basis for the OIC symptoms of 
constipation (Camilleri 2011, Brock et al 2012, Chou et al 2009, McNicol et al 2008, Panchal et al 2007). 
OIC can significantly interfere with activities of daily living, resulting in a lower quality of life. OIC patients 
have a significantly greater resource use than opioid users without OIC, including increased physician 
visits, and alternative care visits (Bell et al 2009, Panchal et al 2007). 
Existing guidelines generally agree on using prophylactic laxative as the first-line preventative treatment 
for OIC, initiated at the same time as opioid treatment. Strategies for subsequent lines of treatment 
should prophylactic measures fail, vary considerably, from no recommendations, to various 
pharmacological suggestions (eg, increasing laxative dose, combining laxatives, opioid rotation, and 
manual disimpaction). While prescription (eg, lactulose) or over-the-counter laxatives (eg, senna and 
bisacodyl) are commonly used to treat OIC in clinical practice, they do not specifically target the opioid 
mediated mechanisms that cause constipation, and often fail to provide adequate treatment for many 
patients. Other available treatment options include methylnaltrexone (a subcutaneous injection for 
patients with advanced medical illness, available in the US, EU and Canada), and lubiprostone (approved 
in the US as an oral treatment of OIC in patients with chronic non cancer pain).  
Patients receiving opioids for their pain have a clear unmet medical need and would benefit from an oral 
therapy that directly addresses the underlying OIC GI pathophysiology and that provides a durable and 
consistent relief. The need is especially apparent for patients who continue to have constipation 
symptoms despite treatment with laxatives (eg, Muller-Lissner 2013, Bell et al 2009).  
The physiological effects of opioids are primarily mediated by 3 well-characterized opioid receptor 
sub-types, mu (μ), kappa (κ) and delta (δ) (Holzer 2007). Mu-opioid receptors are widely distributed in 
the central nervous system (CNS) and are involved in the perception of pain, and in the mesenteric and 
sub-mucosal plexi of the enteric nervous system where they regulate peristaltic activity. Thus while the 
analgesic effects of exogenous opioids rely upon distribution to the CNS, their interference with normal 
function of the gut, underlying the development of OIC, is thought to be primarily via distribution to 
tissues outside the blood-brain barrier (BBB) (based on Camilleri 2011). 
Naloxegol is a μ-opioid receptor antagonist that has been developed as an oral treatment for OIC. In 
receptor binding experiments, it is a full competitive antagonist of μ-opioid receptors, an antagonist of 
δ-opioid receptors and a weak partial agonist at the κ-opioid receptors, with the highest binding affinity at 
μ-opioid receptors ( 27 fold more potent binding at mu than delta receptors). 
Naloxegol is PEG naloxol, also known as a PEGylated derivative of naloxone. It is a substrate of the 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter, which substantially limits its ability to cross the BBB. Naloxegol, by 
binding to μ-opioid receptors within the GI tract targets the underlying causes of OIC. With its antagonist

effects essentially restricted to the opioid receptors located outside the CNS, naloxegol is expected to 
alleviate OIC without reducing the central analgesic effects of opioids. Naloxegol tablets are to be 
administered once daily, in the morning (to avoid bowel movements in the middle of the night) on an 
empty stomach at least 30 minutes prior to the first meal of the day or 2 hours post-meal. The 
recommended therapeutic dose is 25 mg. The naloxegol dose should be decreased to 12.5 mg daily when 
co-administered with dual P-gp/moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. 
Naloxegol has the potential to offer clinical benefits compared with existing therapies as an oral agent in 
the peripherally-acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist (PAMORA) class developed for patients with OIC.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 12.5 and 25 mg of naloxegol as active 
substance.  
The other ingredients are mannitol (E421), microcrystalline cellulose (E460), croscarmellose sodium 
(E468), magnesium stearate (E470b) and propyl gallate (E310) in the tablet core and hypromellose 
(E464), titanium dioxide (E171), macrogol (E1521), iron oxide red (E172) and iron oxide black (E172) in 
the tablet coat. 
The product is available in alu/alu blisters. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of naloxegol is 
(5α,6α)-17-allyl-6-(2,5,8,11,14,17,20-heptaoxadocosan-22-yloxy)-4,5-epoxymorphinan-3,14-diol 
oxalate and has the following structure: 
The structure of naloxegol was unambiguously confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR, including 2D correlation 
experiments, IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, single crystal X-ray crystallography, and the synthetic 
process, taking into account the structures of starting materials, reagents, and intermediates. 
The active substance is a white to off-white crystalline solid, highly soluble in aqueous media according to 
BCS classification, highly soluble in ethanol and very slightly soluble in isopropyl ether. Only minor 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/738815/2014  
Page 13/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
moisture uptake is observed below 70% RH, but absorption increases rapidly above this threshold at 80% 
RH and the compound subsequently deliquesces. 
Naloxegol exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of 5 contiguous chiral centres. Enantiomeric 
purity is controlled routinely by specific optical rotation in the specification of the naloxone hydrochloride 
starting material which contains 4 of the stereocentres which can’t epimerise in the subsequent synthetic 
sequence. The fifth stereocentre is installed by a diastereoselective reduction. Analytical methods have 
been demonstrated to detect and quantify the minor diastereoisomer which show that this impurity is 
controlled to an acceptable level by the process. Polymorphism has been observed for naloxegol with a 
second polymorphic form accessible under specific crystallisation conditions. However, this has been 
shown by XRPD data to be excluded under the commercial process. Given the high aqueous solubility of 
the active substance, the physical form of the active substance is considered to be well controlled. 
Naloxegol is a chemical substance not previously authorised as a medicinal product in the European 
Union. Furthermore, it is not a salt, complex, derivative or isomer, (nor mixture of isomers), of a 
previously authorised substance. It is structurally related to the previously authorised substance 
Naloxone from which it is synthesized by reduction and PEGylation. However, the applicant presented 
data indicating that the PEG group is stable to metabolic cleavage and that Naloxegol and Naloxone do not 
share active metabolites. Therefore, the therapeutic moieties are not the same. Naloxegol thus meets the 
definition of a New Active Substance according to the Notice to Applicants (NtA), Vol 2A, Chapter 1, Annex 
3. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Naloxegol is synthesized in four synthetic steps from, naloxone hydrochloride dihydrate, and two other 
starting materials. Naloxone hydrochloride dihydrate is itself an authorised active substance and the 
applicant has provided valid CEPs from the proposed suppliers to justify its suitability as a starting 
material. The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of 
Suitability. The proposed specifications are the same as those from Ph. Eur. with the omission of 
additional tests present in each individual CEP. The absence of these additional tests is well justified. The 
other two starting materials are well-defined materials with acceptable specifications. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and fate and have been fully characterised. Genotoxic impurities have been discussed and 
appropriate limits set to limit them in the isolated active substance. 
Adequate in-process controls (IPCs) are applied during the synthesis and those IPCs critical to active 
substance quality have been defined and explained thoroughly. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented and are justified based 
on a thorough understanding of origin, fate, and purge of impurities. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, identity (IR, 13C NMR – also identifies 
counter-ion), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), 2 potential genotoxic impurities (HPLC, LCMS), residual 
solvents (GC), and residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.). The absence of tests for water, particle size distribution  
and polymorphic form is considered justified. Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold 
according to ICH Q3A were qualified by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications 
have been set. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/738815/2014  
Page 14/120 
 
 
 
 
 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance 
with the ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis data for 19 batches of naloxegol and 39 batches of naloxegol oxalate, 12 of which were 
manufactured at production scale and using the process intended for commercial supply, have been 
provided. The results of the 12 commercial scale batches were well within the specifications and 
consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on 6 pilot scale batches (3 using proposed commercial process, 3 using a very similar 
process with only a minor change in active substance crystallization process) of active substance from the 
proposed manufacturer, stored in the intended commercial package for up to 18 months under long term 
conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. All parameters with the potential to change on stability 
were studied. The parameters tested were the same as for release with the absence of tests for 
identification, 1 potential genotoxin and sulfated ash. Additional tests for known degradants, water 
content, polymorphic form and microbiological quality were included. There was no significant change to 
any of the tested parameters under either storage condition. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on 1 batch. Stressed studies were 
carried out on 1 batch at 50 oC for 1 month and a further batch open to the atmosphere for 4 weeks. The 
parameters tested and the methods used were the same as for primary stability batches with the 
omission of tests for polymorphic form and microbiological quality. There was no significant change to any 
of the tested parameters under all the storage conditions, indicating excellent stability of the active 
substance. 
Forced degradation was carried out under acidic (pH1), neutral (pH7) and alkaline (pH13) aqueous 
conditions in sealed containers in either light or dark and stored at ambient temperature or in a 
refrigerator for 7 days, or under oxidative conditions (0.3% H2O2). No major degradation was observed, 
although several relevant degradation products were identified. The results demonstrate that the 
analytical methods are stability indicating. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 30 months in the proposed 
container. 
The applicant commits to the continuation of all on-going stability studies under long term conditions up 
to the 48 month time point. In addition, stability studies will be carried out on 3 early commercial batches 
of naloxegol under long term, intermediate, and accelerated conditions. Furthermore, at least 1 
commercial batch per year will be placed on a long-term stability study. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The objective of formulation development was to develop immediate-release oral dosage forms of 
naloxegol in two strengths, with reliable release and bioavailability characteristics and adequate quality 
over the product shelf-life. The active substance is a chemically stable crystalline solid, routinely 
manufactured as a single stable polymorph. It is highly soluble in aqueous media from pH1-7.5 but has 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/738815/2014

low intestinal permeability (BCS class III). The finished product shows fast dissolution over the range of 
active substance particle sizes tested. The content uniformity of tablet cores was also consistent when 
manufactured from active substance batches with varying particle size distribution. Therefore, particle 
size distribution is not considered critical and no limit is set for the active substance. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. Their compatibility with the active substance was demonstrated by 
long-term and accelerated stability studies. A post-authorisation change management protocol has been 
approved to allow modifications to the process for modifying and controlling propyl gallate particle size 
distribution. The compositions of the 2 tablet strengths are proportional. 
Dry processing techniques were used throughout development. Critical quality attributes (CQAs) for the 
finished product were defined as tablet description, active substance identification, assay, degradation 
products, dissolution, uniformity of dosage units, water content and microbiological quality. These CQAs 
directed a series of development studies looking at levels of different excipients optimising compaction, 
disintegration and dissolution time with the tablets’ mechanical properties, as well as preventing 
degradation and ensuring uniformity and robustness of formulation to minor variations in excipient and 
active substance quality. The film-coating is added to produce uniform tablets meeting the appearance 
CQAs and does not affect the dissolution profile. 
A loss in crystallinity is observed for the active substance once formulated and this is due to interaction 
with water in intra-tablet micro-environments and the deliquescent nature of the active substance at high 
relative humidity. No increase in degradation is observed, nor is there any significant change to the 
dissolution properties, and thus, no tests for drug substance crystallinity are required. 
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has not been demonstrated. However, development 
studies have consistently demonstrated that dissolution is always rapid, independent of critical 
manufacturing parameters, and so a discriminatory test is not considered to be important for the finished 
product. 
The original formulations used in clinical trials (phases I-III) employed naloxegol free base which is a 
hygroscopic, water-soluble oil, sensitive to degradation on exposure to heat, light, or oxidants, and thus 
requiring special handling, shipping, and storage conditions. The phase I formulation was an aqueous 
solution whereas later studies employed film-coated tablets containing naloxegol free base. An in vivo 
study demonstrated that the free base aqueous solution and the oxalate salt immediate release tablet are 
bioequivalent. The crystalline oxalate salt was selected for the commercial formulation because it is much 
more stable which allows for simpler handling and storage. In vivo bioequivalence to the phase III free 
base formulation was demonstrated for the commercial 25 mg film-coated tablet. A biowaiver for the 12.5 
mg commercial film-coated tablet was accepted because it is has the same dose-proportional composition 
as the 25 mg tablet and has similar, rapid in vitro dissolution performance. 
The primary packaging is alu/alu blisters which are available in two configurations depending on the 
intended user. The first is for hospital use and contains perforated blisters. The second is for all other 
users and is non-perforated. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the 
container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of three main steps: 1) the active substance and excipients are 
blended by dry-mixing; 2) the dry blend is compressed to form tablet cores; 3) the cores are film-coated 
before packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. Therefore, formal 
validation of the process in the production facilities has not yet been completed but will be carried out 
prior to release of Moventig film-coated tablets to the market. A process validation scheme has been 
presented which is considered acceptable. Routine batch manufacture at the commercial manufacturing 
site throughout the product lifecycle will be monitored using a continued process verification approach. 
In-process controls (IPCs) are carried out after the compression and film-coating steps to ensure that 
CQAs of the product are met. These are considered adequate to control the production of Moventig 
film-coated tablets. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the 
finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications comprise appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form 
including description (visual inspection), identification (HPLC and UV), assay (HPLC), degradants (HPLC), 
dissolution (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage unit (HPLC), water content (KF) and microbiological quality 
(Ph. Eur.). There are also tests for identification and assay of the propyl gallate (HPLC). 
Batch analysis results are provided for 19 batches of Moventig, 7 using naloxegol free base, (which are 
considered as supportive data) and 12 using naloxegol oxalate, used for clinical and stability studies. Of 
the 12 batches made with the oxalate salt, 2 used the intended commercial process and the other 10 
synthesized using a slightly different crystallization process. 
All batches complied with the proposed specification, confirming the consistency of the manufacturing 
process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data on 3 commercial scale batches of finished product of each strength stored in the proposed 
commercial pack under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) for up to 12 months, under intermediate 
conditions (30 oC, 75% RH) for up to 12 months, and under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) for 
up to 6 months according to the ICH guidelines were provided. These were all manufactured with active 
substance synthesized using a slightly different crystallization process. Samples were tested for 
description, assay, degradants, a potential genotoxic impurity, dissolution, water content and 
microbiological quality. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. An additional two batches 
of tablets of each strength containing active substance manufactured by the commercial process have 
also been put on stability studies under long-term, intermediate and accelerated conditions although 
those stored under long-term conditions will only be tested if significant changes are observed under 
intermediate conditions. Up to 6 months of stability data is available for these batches. Analogous data 
has also been provided on the same 10 batches stored in a bulk pack. Little or no change was observed 
in either the commercial or bulk pack except for minor decrease in assay under all conditions and slight 
increase in degradants and associated decrease in assay under accelerated conditions. 
In addition, stressed stability studies were carried out on 1 commercial scale batch of each strength. The 
finished  product was exposed for up to 12 weeks to open conditions, for up to 3 months at 50 ºC exposed 
to atmospheric humidity, and for up to 1 month to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability

Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. A minor decrease in assay and increase in one degradation 
product was observed in both commercial and bulk pack under thermal stress. Degradation to the same 
degradation product was also noted in the open storage samples, along with an initial increase in water 
content. The photostability samples showed little or no change – other than a minor increase in 1 
degradant. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life as stated in the SmPC is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
None of the excipients used in Moventig finished product are of animal or human origin. The magnesium 
stearate is from a vegetable source. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical profile of naloxegol was established in a comprehensive investigational program that 
included studies of in vitro and in vivo pharmacology, safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and 
toxicity. 
This included a series of in vitro assays to characterize the primary pharmacological action on opioid 
receptors such as assays to determine binding affinities as well as assays designed to establish any 
agonist/antagonist activity. A battery of in vivo studies was also performed to determine the functional 
effect of naloxegol on central and peripheral opioid agonist-induced effects. The secondary pharmacology 
assessment of naloxegol was based on testing in a diverse panel of 327 targets covering a broad spectrum 
of receptors, ion channels and enzymes. 
Naloxegol was also examined in a series of in vitro and in vivo safety pharmacology studies to assess 
potential effects on the central nervous, cardiovascular, gastro intestinal, respiratory, and renal systems. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/738815/2014  
Page 18/120 
 
 
 
 
 
All pharmacology and safety pharmacology studies were conducted with naloxegol free base. Drug 
interaction studies were not conducted in nonclinical animal models. 
The pharmacokinetic and absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) properties of 
naloxegol have been studied in vitro and in vivo in mouse, rat, dog and monkey using the strains involved 
in the safety evaluation where appropriate. All studies were conducted with naloxegol free base unless 
identified as using the oxalate salt. Toxicokinetic monitoring of safety studies has been performed in 
accordance with Good Laboratory Practice using validated high performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry detection (LC-MS/MS) methods. 
A comprehensive battery of nonclinical toxicity studies was conducted to evaluate the safety profile of 
naloxegol. Single- and repeat-dose oral toxicity studies were conducted in mice, rats, and dogs. Recovery 
from drug-induced effects was evaluated in rat and dog studies. 
A standard battery of in vitro and in vivo genetic toxicology studies and 2-year carcinogenicity studies in 
mice and rats were conducted to determine the genotoxic and carcinogenic potential of naloxegol. 
A fertility study in rats, embryo-fetal development studies in rats and rabbits, and pre- and postnatal 
development studies in rats were conducted to determine the potential naloxegol-related effects on 
reproductive function, embryo-fetal development, gestation, parturition, lactation, and offspring viability 
and development. Additional investigative studies were conducted to explore potential mechanisms of 
action underlying an increased incidence of Leydig cell tumors and hyperplasia in the rat 2 year 
carcinogenicity study. 
All toxicology studies were conducted with naloxegol free base unless identified as using the oxalate salt. 
Dose selection for pivotal studies was principally based on dose range finding studies or results from 
preceding studies to ensure that adequately high doses were evaluated. 
The range of non-clinical data presented in the dossier covers reports from all main studies required for 
a new active substance and literature sources not designed specifically for the applicable product. The 
data is the basis for the discussion of this assessment report. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The primary pharmacological action of naloxegol was assessed in a number of in vitro and in vivo assays 
including: competitive inhibition studies performed in CHO cells expressing cloned human opioid 
receptors, use of membrane preparations of cells expressing cloned human μ- and δ- opioid receptors and 
cloned rat κ-opioid receptors and [35S]GTPγS binding assay performed on membranes of Human 
Embryonic Kidney 293 (HEK-293S) cell. Naloxegol was further characterized for its competitive 
antagonism on human μ-opioid receptors in Schild-type experiments for its ability to elicit right-shifts in 
the concentration response curve of morphine in [35S]GTPγS binding experiments. The activity of 
naloxegol at δ- and κ-opioid receptors was assessed using [35S]GTPγS functional assays in CHO and 
HEK-293 cells, respectively 
In vitro primary pharmacology data show that naloxegol is a pure antagonist at the  μ-opioid receptor, as 
well as a δ-opioid receptor antagonist and a partial agonist at the κ-opioid receptor. Naloxegol did not 
display any kappa agonist activity in the isolated rabbit vas deferens tissue assay. 
Naloxegol was approximately 3-fold more potent than methylnaltrexone at human μ-opioid receptors 
both in binding affinity and functional antagonism. At cloned human δ-opioid receptors, naloxegol was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/738815/2014  
Page 19/120 
 
 
 
 
 
approximately 9-fold more potent than methylnaltrexone. At cloned rat κ -opioid receptors, the binding 
affinity of naloxegol and methylnaltrexone were similar.  
The in vivo data, obtained in a Rat Model of morphine-induced reversal of opioid effects, showed that 
naloxegol is approximately a 49-fold less potent opioid receptor antagonist than naloxone within the CNS 
on reversal of iv morphine analgesia. On the other hand, naloxegol can completely antagonize the effect 
of iv morphine on the GI tract with a potency about 33- fold less than that of naloxone. This supports that 
compared to naloxone, naloxegol can reverse morphine-induced slowing of GI transit at doses that do not 
reverse morphine analgesia. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The secondary pharmacodynamics of naloxegol were assessed using a diverse panel of 327 targets 
covering a broad spectrum of receptors, transporters, ion channels and enzymes. Naloxegol was inactive 
in this panel with an exposure multiple of at least 81x the human Cmax exposure at the Maximum 
Recommended Human Dose (MRHD) of 25 mg (81 ng/mL). Significant activity was noted at the μ-, δ-, 
and κ-opioid receptors only. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Naloxegol was tested in a battery of safety pharmacology studies which examined potential effects of oral 
naloxegol administration on the central nervous, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal and renal 
systems. 
A modified Irwin’s screen in SD rats shows that naloxegol up to 1000 mg/kg had no effect on condition 
and behaviour up to 4 hours post-dose. In addition, naloxegol had no proconvulsive or analgesic activity 
at doses up to 1000 mg/kg in a rat PTZ model and a mouse grid stimulation analgesia model, respectively. 
Naloxegol had no effect in assays investigating the abuse potential. These consisted of 
drug-discrimination, self-administration and drug dependence studies, in which morphine was used as a 
positive control. Taken together, these data do not indicate that naloxegol would cause any 
CNS-mediated adverse events at the MRHD. When co-administered with morphine, doses of 30 mg/kg 
naloxegol and above antagonized the psychoactive effects of morphine, but these doses are estimated to 
correspond to exposures of at least 15x the human Cmax exposure at the MRHD of 25 mg (81 ng/mL). 
With respect to cardiovascular safety, naloxegol had an IC50 >300 μM at the hERG ion channel and was 
inactive against a further 7 cardiac channels. Naloxegol was inactive in a cardiac myocyte contractility 
assay and rat isolated heart model. However, in a conscious dog telemetry study, administration of doses 
of naloxegol above 5 mg/kg was associated with moderate, reversible and non dose-related decreases 
from baseline in arterial blood pressure (-9%), left ventricular systolic pressure (-13%) and indices of 
cardiac contractility. The NOEL corresponded to a measured Cmax value of 99 ng/mL, and hence 
approximately equal to the human exposure at the MRHD (81 ng/mL). However, ECG and blood pressure 
were also measured as part of the dog toxicology studies (14-day, 28-day and 9-month) and no 
treatment-related effects on these parameters were noted in any of these studies. In addition, in the 
clinical safety data, similar findings have not been reported. In conclusion, the observed effects in the dog 
telemetry study are probably of low relevance for humans at the intended therapeutic doses.   
Rat  plethysmography,  gastric  emptying/intestinal  transport  and  renal  function  studies  indicated  that 
naloxegol  is  unlikely  to  have  any  adverse  effect  on  the  respiratory  system,  gastrointestinal  or  renal 
systems  at  the  MRHD.  At  higher  doses,  naloxegol  increased  stomach  weight  and  inhibited  intestinal 
transport.  The  NOELs  for  these  effects  corresponded  to  15x  and  112x  the  exposures  at  the  MRHD, 
respectively.

Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
With the exception of studies which assessed the effect of naloxegol on morphine induced parameters 
listed above, no studies investigating pharmacodynamic drug interactions were conducted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic properties of naloxegol have been studied in vitro, and in vivo using the species and 
strains involved in the safety evaluation. All studies were conducted with naloxegol free base unless 
identified as using the oxalate salt. Analytical methods for naloxegol, naloxegol glucuronide and naloxone 
were developed by Nektar Therapeutics and used by them and at Contract Research Organisations to 
support the development of naloxegol. Toxicokinetic monitoring of safety studies has been performed in 
accordance with Good Laboratory Practice using validated high performance liquid 
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry detection methods. The assays have been applied to plasma 
and urine samples from mouse, rabbit, dog, and monkey and to plasma, urine and bile from rat. 
An in vitro study in Caco2 cells and an in situ permeability study at low doses in rats indicate that the PEG 
chain in naloxegol results in lower intrinsic permeability across membranes as compared to naloxone and 
suggest that naloxegol is a Pgp substrate, which corresponds to the intended pharmacokinetic properties.  
Bioavailability after a single oral dose is low in dogs and monkeys. Data in rat or mouse are not presented. 
It is not possible to compare the bioavailability in animals with corresponding human data since the 
absolute oral bioavailability in humans has not been determined.   
Steady state AUC data from the toxicology studies indicate that the exposures in animals were 
significantly greater than the human exposure at the MRHD of 25 mg (330 ng.h/mL). The exposure 
increased with dose in all species and was sometimes more than proportional at high doses. Exposure was 
higher in male mice and female rats but there was no sex difference in dogs. The exposure of mice is lower 
than in other species, particularly at high doses. 
The exposure in rats in terms of Cmax and AUC are reported to be similar after administration of 
naloxegol as free base or oxalate salt. 
The plasma protein binding of naloxegol was low in all species that were tested (mouse 14.1%, rat 
20.8%, monkey, 9.7% and human 4.2%; in dogs it was concentration dependent with a maximum of 
around 50%). Hence, exposure margins have been calculated using total concentrations. There are no 
data on protein binding in rabbits. 
Naloxegol mainly distributes in the liver, kidney, small intestine wall, glandular tissues (pituitary, 
preputial gland), reproductive organs (uterus, placenta) and pigmented tissues (uveal tract). A sex 
difference was observed for the female rats, i.e. an earlier Tmax and higher concentrations than males. 
This is in line with the TK data for rat and is attributed to the sex linked expression of the major metabolic 
enzymes involved. Significantly less and slower brain penetration compared to naloxone was confirmed in 
an in vivo brain penetration study.  
Naloxegol is excreted in rat milk, it remains unknown whether in addition to naloxegol itself the 
metabolites are also excreted in rat milk.  
The major metabolic processes of naloxegol in humans are N-dealkylation and oxidative metabolism of 
the PEG chain, including partial cleavage but not complete removal of the chain. Glucuronide conjugation 
at the phenol hydroxyl is also a common process in animals and man but the naloxegol glucuronide shows 
very low concentrations in the human plasma. Four significant circulating metabolites were identified (M1, 
M7, M10 and M13) in humans, mice, rats and dogs and the major metabolizing enzymes involved in man 
seem to be CYP3A4/5.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/738815/2014  
Page 21/120 
 
 
 
 
 
There is no metabolite in human plasma or urine that exceeds 10% of the parent drug. In addition, no 
metabolites unique to humans were identified after metabolite comparison across species. The similarity 
of the metabolic process observed across species supports the use of the mouse, the rat and the dog for 
the toxicological testing. Apart from the TK data for naloxegol and naloxegol-glucuronide, there are no 
data on the metabolism in rabbits.  
Excretion is mainly fecal in all species, with renal excretion to a lesser extent. In male rats the excretion 
is predominantly biliary. 
Data from in vitro drug interaction experiments have demonstrated that naloxegol is a Pgp substrate but 
is not a direct inhibitor of CYP enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP3A4) nor transporters 
(Pgp, BCRP, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3) at expected concentrations in humans. As a Pgp 
substrate, naloxegol absorption and its distribution into the brain could be increased if coadministered 
with Pgp inhibitors. Since it is predominantly metabolised by CYP 3A4/5, inducers or inhibitors of these 
enzymes would be expected to affect the naloxegol concentration. Both interactions have been 
investigated and confirmed through clinical studies. It is acknowledged that interaction with potent Pgp 
inhibitors at the blood-brain barrier, are unlikely to have a clinical impact. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicity of naloxegol was adequately evaluated in mice, rats, rabbits and dogs in a comprehensive 
battery of GLP compliant non-clinical toxicity studies and at exposures markedly higher than the human 
exposures at the recommended human dose. 
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose oral and intravenous toxicity studies were carried out in the mouse and rat with doses up 
2000 mg/kg. These studies were generally designed to identify doses for the repeat dose toxicology 
studies. A single dose pharmacokinetic study in dogs involved single oral doses up to 20 mg/kg, and the 
results are relevant to assessing the potential for adverse clinical signs up to that dose in dogs. 
In mice in-life observations of intolerability (eg, decreased motor activity, hunched posture and 
piloerection) were seen at 2000 mg/kg. No clinical signs were observed at the other dose levels of 500 
and 1000 mg/kg. 
In rats naloxegol was tolerated at up to 2000 mg/kg, although slight in-life observations (eg, half-shut 
eyes, piloerection) were observed in some animals at doses of 500 mg/kg and above.  
In the dog naloxegol was well tolerated (with the exception of sporadic soft feces) although doses in these 
acute pharmacokinetic studies did not exceed 20 mg/kg. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat dose oral toxicity studies were carried out in the mice (up to 3 months), rats (up to 6 months), and 
dogs (up to 9 months). A recovery period was included in the 1-month studies and the 6/9-months 
studies to investigate the reversibility of any toxicological finding. A 7-day study in rats and two 14-day 
studies in dogs served as dose-finding studies for the 1- and the 3-months studies. The 3-months studies 
in rats and mice served as dose-finding studies for the 2-year carcinogenicity studies. 
Most of the effects observed in the pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies in the two main toxicology species, 
the rat and dog, and the mouse as a second rodent species for carcinogenicity assessment, were 
generally limited to effects on body weight and food consumption as well as stress-related findings which 
occurred at dose levels above the NOAEL and generally at doses at or close to the maximum tolerated 
dose level. The assessment of effects on the gastrointestinal system in an acute safety pharmacology 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/738815/2014  
Page 22/120 
 
 
 
 
 
study demonstrated a naloxegol-mediated increase in stomach weight and inhibition of intestinal 
transport at ≥100 mg/kg and this effect on the GI tract could at least in part explain the decreases in body 
weight gain and food intake observed in the repeat dose toxicity studies. 
Whilst most findings in the repeat dose toxicity studies were likely not related to inhibition of opioid 
receptor signaling, a dose-related finding of soft stool/diarrhoea in the dog may reflect exaggerated 
pharmacological effects. Some findings, such as ataxia, tremors and hypoactive behavior seen at high 
doses in the dog, were likely to be indicative of CNS exposure. This is not considered to be relevant for 
naloxegol at the intended clinical dose.  
The observed neoplasms in the 3 month and 6 month rat studies do not show a dose-relationship, the 
tumors were of different origin, there were no increases in pre-neoplastic lesions in other animals of the 
same study or in the other rat studies and similar lesions were not reproduced in the 2-year 
carcinogenicity studies. Therefore these findings are not considered to be of concern at the proposed 
human dose.  
The target organ of toxicity identified across all main toxicity species was the liver (weight increase and 
associated hypertrophy in rats, weight increase in dogs), but these findings were slight, adaptive and 
reversible. These findings occurred at exposures sufficiently above the maximum human exposure and 
are hence to be considered of little relevance to clinical use. In addition, clinical safety data do not indicate 
that administration of naloxegol has adverse effects on the human liver (no effects on cholesterol, AST, 
ALT levels). 
Non-clinical exposure multiples at the NOAEL for any other findings in the chronic toxicity studies were at 
least 248x (rat 6-month chronic toxicity study) and greater than 35x (dog 1-month toxicity study) the 
human exposure at the MRHD. 
Genotoxicity 
Naloxegol free base was evaluated in the standard genetic toxicology battery, including the bacterial 
mutation (Ames) test, the mouse lymphoma TK assay and the mouse bone marrow micronucleus test. 
Naloxegol free base was found to be positive in the Ames test. Naloxegol free base was negative in the 
mouse lymphoma TK assay and the in vivo micronucleus assay. Naloxone has also been shown positive in 
the Ames mutagenicity and in vitro human lymphocyte chromosome aberration tests but was also not 
genotoxic in vivo. In addition, phenanthrene-based drugs, to which naloxegol and naloxone belong, as a 
class do not seem to represent a carcinogenic risk to patients (Aardema et al, 2008). However, following 
the identification of glycidaldehyde as a genotoxic degradation product in various batches of naloxegol 
free base, naloxegol oxalate was selected for commercial formulation which avoids the formation of this 
genotoxic degradation product. Naloxegol oxalate was negative in the Ames test. The amount of 
glycidaldehyde that is still present as impurity has been measured to be below 10 ppm and is thus present 
in amounts below the TTC, which is acceptable. 
Carcinogenicity 
Naloxegol was tested in rodent carcinogenicity studies in CD1 mice and Sprague-Dawley rats. The 
carcinogenic potential of naloxegol when administered daily via oral gavage to mice and rats was 
evaluated in carcinogenicity studies of approximately 2 years in duration 
There were no naloxegol-mediated neoplastic changes in the mouse carcinogenicity study but an increase 
in Leydig cell hyperplasia and adenoma was seen in males in the rat carcinogenicity study. Leydig cell 
tumours are a common testicular tumour type in rodent carcinogenicity studies, especially in Fisher 344 
rats. However, the incidence in Sprague-Dawley rats is usually less than 5%. Similar tumours or 
pre-neoplastic lesions were not seen in the 6-month rat study. 
Investigative work identified the underlying mechanism as a hormonal- and centrally mediated opioid 
antagonistic effect involving a naloxegol-mediated increase in luteinizing hormone. The suggested mode 
of action is already described for other drugs that are reported to produce Leydig cell tumours in rodents. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/738815/2014  
Page 23/120 
 
 
 
 
 
Many of these are non-genotoxic and appear to modify pathways that regulate the hypothalamic - 
pituitary- gonadal axis, often ultimately producing elevations in serum luteinizing hormone and 
consequent Leydig cell response. In most instances, the modifications of the hormonal control 
mechanisms at high doses in rats are not directly relevant to humans when given these agents at 
therapeutic doses. Moreover, the available evidence suggests that the proliferative response of the Leydig 
cell in human to alterations in hormone status is far less that in the rat.  
Based on the available evidence about the suggested mode of action and the non-clinical data for 
naloxegol, a non-genotoxic, threshold mechanism can be assumed. The exposure at the neoplastic 
NOAEL was 51x the human exposure at the MRHD. It is therefore expected that therapeutic naloxegol 
doses do not significantly increase LH levels and thus is considered unlikely that similar (pre-) neoplastic 
lesions in the testes of patients will be induced following chronic treatment with naloxegol.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
The reproductive and development toxicity studies performed include a male and female fertility study in 
the rat, embryo-fetal development and associated dose-range finding studies in the rat and rabbit, and a 
dose-range findings study for the pre- and post-natal development study as well as the actual pre- and 
post-natal development study in the rat. 
Naloxegol did not impair fertility in rats. An increase in testis weight was observed at the highest dose 
group. In absence of associated histopathological changes or fertility effects and given the fact that, in the 
repeat-dose toxicity studies, no effects on testis weight were seen (at doses up to 500-800 mg/kg/day), 
this high-dose finding is not considered to be relevant for humans. 
Naloxegol administration to pregnant rats resulted at the highest doses in a skeletal variation (bipartite 
vertebral centrum) and a visceral malformation (anorchism). Although a slight increase in the skeletal 
variation - within the historical control ranges - was seen at the low and mid dose, this effect was only 
significant at the high dose in the presence of maternal toxicity.  
Naloxegol administration to pregnant rabbits resulted at the highest doses in a fetal skeletal malformation 
(fused arches). This effect was seen in the absence of significant maternal toxicity. 
A relation to treatment cannot be excluded the effects on embryofetal development at the high doses in 
both rats and rabbits. However these effects were observed at exposures considered sufficiently in excess 
of the maximum human exposure. The exposures at the NOAEL for embryo-fetal toxicity or 
malformations were 1452x the human exposure at the MRHD in the rat and 79x for malformations in the 
rabbit. Hence, the relevance of the developmental effects observed in the rat and rabbit to human safety 
is considered low.  
In a pre- and postnatal study in rats, a lower body weight in F1 males was evident from birth to PND 21 
in all dosed groups. This effect was statistically significant in the mid and high dose (>10% decrease) and 
appears to be dose-related. F1 females show a similar trend during pre-weaning but fully recover 
post-weaning, while males don’t. Therefore, the NOAEL for the F1 generation is considered to be 50 
mg/kg/day, and not 500 mg/kg/day as proposed by the applicant. Although the effects are considered to 
be treatment-related, it is acknowledged that the clinical relevance of this finding is low in view of the high 
safety margin compared to the human exposure at the MRHD (maternal AUC at 50 mg/kg/day = 23291 
ng*h/mL, safety margin of 70) and the absence of any other adverse effects on postnatal development. 
Toxicokinetic data 
The toxicokinetic data and pharmacokinetic parameters obtained in naloxegol’s non-clinical studies and 
their comparison with respective human data indicate that the relationship between animal exposure for 
naloxegol associated with toxic effects was far from human exposure expected with maximum proposed 
dosage for applicable product.

Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance studies have not been conducted. Since the proposed, clinical route of administration of 
applicable product is oral, there is no need for special assessment of the local tolerance of naloxegol. The 
lack of local tolerance studies is justified. 
Other toxicity studies 
Non-clinical photoreactivity or photosafety tests have not been conducted. In pigmented tissues 
radioactivity persisted up to 504 hours and uveal tract radioactivity concentrations were high, which 
indicates an association with melanin. Naloxegol oxalate shows modest absorption in the 290-700 nm 
range. The maximum absorption is 290 nm (UVC) with the tail extending up to 300 nm (UVB). No 
absorption is found in the UVA range (≥315nM). The molar extinction coefficient (MEC) of 1216 
Lmol-1cm-1 at 290 nm is slightly above the threshold of 1000 Lmol-1cm-1.  
The key chemical building blocks of naloxegol, principally naloxone and PEG have not been reported as 
presenting any photosafety risk. In addition, the clinical photosafety assessment of naloxegol based on 
the clinical studies conducted, supports the conclusion that naloxegol does not pose a photosafety risk in 
clinical use. Therefore, it is agreed that the overall photosafety risk for naloxegol oxalate is probably low 
and therefore further non-clinical testing is not considered necessary. 
The impurities MsO-PEG4-naloxol, glycidaldehyde, α-chloro, and mPEG7-OMs were identified as 
mutagenic and specification of less than 400 ppm is proposed by the applicant. This threshold calculated 
based on a LTL (less than lifetime exposure) approach is acceptable.

A default PECsurface water of 0.13 µg/L has been calculated, which is above the threshold for conducting 
a Phase II assessment. The results of toxicity tests with microorganisms, algae, Daphnia and fish were 
used to calculate PNECs. The PEC/PNEC ratios for surface water and ground water are well below 1 and 
the PEC/PNEC for microorganisms is well below 0.1, hence no further evaluation is needed in Tier B.   
Based on the adsorption coefficient to sludge, a risk assessment in the terrestrial compartment is not 
required. The degradation study of naloxegol in aquatic sediment systems indicates that naloxegol is 
rapidly shifted from water to sediment and is likely to become irreversibly bound to sediment. 
Consequently, the effects on the sediment dwelling organism Chironomus riparius have been investigated 
in Tier B. The PEC/PNEC ratio for sediment dwelling organisms was below 1. Naloxegol is not considered 
as PBT nor vPvB. 
Considering the above data, Naloxegol is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacological profile of naloxegol is well defined. Its mode of action is typical for the class of opioid 
antagonists. It exhibits potent opioid antagonist activity with potential of clinical utility as proposed for 
applicable tablets of 12.5 mg and 25 mg. Results of in vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamic studies 
revealed potent action of naloxegol in terms of reversing occupation of opioid receptors (mainly 
µ-receptors) by opioid agonists. Non-clinical data available on naloxegol indicates that this compound 
exhibit similar qualitative efficacy profile compared to previously approved oral opioid antagonists for 
OIC.  
Taking into account a common clinical practice of OIC therapy, strictly related to the two drugs interaction 
(opioid analgesic with agonist activity and opioid antagonist used for reversal of OIBD), it is most 
important to find adequate data on pharmacodynamic interactions between naloxegol and opioid 
analgesics. This interaction both at the peripheral level, with confirmed antagonism as expected, and CNS 
level, with no significant antagonism, was shown. 
The knowledge about oral naloxegol pharmacokinetics, collected on the basis of submitted dossier 
indicates that the pharmacokinetic profiles of both naloxegol and its metabolites have been adequately 
examined. The collected data is sufficient for the assessment of product planned for oral administration.  
Based on the results of non-clinical pharmacokinetic studies it can be claimed, that due to reduced 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/738815/2014  
Page 27/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
systemic availability and low CNS permeability of naloxegol administered orally, the risk related to its CNS 
unwanted activity antagonizing analgesic effects of opioids in proposed clinical dosage is apparently 
reduced. This risk does not seem to be greater than the risk related to use of previously approved oral 
opioid antagonists for OIC.  
There is no evidence for any basic difference in metabolic pathways of naloxegol between animals and 
humans. Thus, toxicological studies performed in chosen species and routes of administration are 
adequate for non-clinical assessment. 
Naloxegol has potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs related to CYP3A4/5 inhibition and/or 
activation. Since it is predominantly metabolised by CYP 3A4/5, inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes 
would be expected to affect the naloxegol concentration. Furthermore, it is acknowledged that interaction 
with potent Pgp inhibitors at the blood-brain barrier, are unlikely to have a clinical impact   
The single-dose toxicity studies demonstrated low toxicity of naloxegol both in mice, rats and dogs. 
Similarly to single dose studies, naloxegol had a low toxicity in repeat dose studies with broad margin 
between the exposition related to NOAEL/NOEL and exposition in humans after maximum recommended 
clinical dose of 25 mg/day. There was no clear evidence that there is a specific target for naloxegol 
toxicity. 
The results of submitted genotoxicity tests did not reveal any significant risk carried by naloxegol oxalate. 
There was no evidence of treatment-related increases in tumor incidence following administration of 
naloxegol to mice. No risk to humans was found according to analysis of the mixed results of rat 
carcinogenicity studies.   
Naloxegol has a very high safety margin for reproductive toxicity comparing to human exposition after 
maximum recommended clinical dose. 
The impurities of naloxegol present no safety concerns for clinical practice based on the specification of 
less than 400 ppm as proposed by the applicant.  
The environmental risk assessment of naloxegol indicate that it is assumed to pose no risk to the 
environment  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The Non-clinical aspects of development for Moventig have been adequately addressed. Toxicology 
studies indicate a good tolerability of the product taking into consideration that toxic effects are shown in 
animals when in-vivo exposition is far from the exposition expected with the maximum proposed dosage 
in human. From a non-clinical point of view, the profile of this product is acceptable. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
During development of the Phase III program, there were no established treatment guidelines or 
generally accepted publications on diagnostic or treatment practices for patients with OIC. Therefore, the 
design for the studies in the naloxegol Phase III program was defined based on: 
1)  key scientific literature on treatment trials of OIC and chronic constipation,  
2)  regional treatment guidelines in the US and Europe,  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/738815/2014  
Page 28/120 
 
 
 
 
 
3)  available regulatory meeting documentation concerning other development programs for orally 
administered agents intended for the treatment of opioid-related bowel conditions or chronic 
constipation, and  
4)  consultation with internal and external disease experts, including the Principal Investigators. 
Scientific advice was sought from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) on the 
studies included in the Phase III program and the following main considerations were discussed and 
endorsed: 
•  A responder to study drug during weeks 1 to 12 was defined as a patient with at least 3 
SBMs/week and at least a 1 SBM/week increase over baseline for at least 9 out of the 12 
treatment weeks and 3 out of the last 4 treatment weeks during the double-blind treatment 
period. Thus, the primary endpoint incorporates both the durability of effect and a clinically 
relevant increase in the SBM rates across the 12-week treatment period. 
The original 4-week primary endpoint in the confirmatory studies was changed in a protocol 
amendment approximately 11 months before unblinding to response evaluated over the entire 
12-week study duration. This agreement also included using a multiple testing procedure (MTP) 
to control the overall type-I error across the primary and key secondary endpoints, for 
comparisons between the 2 naloxegol doses with placebo. 
•  Extrapolation of US data to EU population. 
A paediatric investigation plan was adopted by the PDCO in August 2012. A deferral was agreed regarding 
the initiation and completion of the naloxegol paediatric study until a juvenile rat toxicology study is 
complete and PK, safety and efficacy are evaluated in the adult population. An age-appropriate 
formulation will be developed. A waiver was granted for studies in children less than 6 months because of 
potential incomplete development of the BBB in this age group. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The applicant has 
provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were carried out in 
accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
Naloxegol undergoes rapid absorption with peak plasma concentrations attained less than 2 h after single 
doses of 5 to 1000 mg, and twice daily doses of 25 to 250 mg for up to 8 days. A secondary plasma 
concentration peak for all naloxegol formulations was observed in a number of volunteers approximately 
0.4 to 3 h after the first peak, and was more prominent at lower doses (8 mg to 125 mg), which is likely 
due to enterohepatic recycling.  
Naloxegol exposure is dose proportional at therapeutic doses. Following multiple dosing, steady state is 
achieved within 2 to 3 days, and minimal accumulation is observed with once daily dosing.  
No absolute bioavailability data were provided. However, the results of the mass balance study indicate 
that the bioavailability might be 60%, provided that no degradation of the parent compound occurs in the 
faeces. However, metabolites M13, M10, M7 and M1 have been detected in plasma. M12 is formed by 
oxidation of M13 and M4 is formed by oxidation of M9, the product of demethylation of the PEG chain 
shown to be produced by CYP3A in vitro. In addition, the applicant further provided information that all 
identified metabolites are not formed by reductive processes, as such limiting the probability that these 
have been formed due to degradation of naloxegol in the faeces. Only for the remaining unidentified 
component (MX1) this is not clear; however, as this component represents only 2.2% of dose, it is 
considered unlikely that this would change the conclusions significantly. 
Both naloxegol and naloxegol oxalate drug substance show high solubility in aqueous media from pH 1 to 
pH 7.5, thus ensuring good solubility of naloxegol in the stomach as well as in the small intestine. 
According to the Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) Classification, based on the results of the 
pH solubility study, naloxegol and naloxegol oxalate are considered as highly soluble drug substances. 
Available permeability data suggest that naloxegol has a low permeability according to the BCS 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/738815/2014  
Page 31/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Classification. Thus, naloxegol is classified as a BCS class III compound and for this type of drug 
substance, the drug absorption (permeability) is rate limiting and not the dissolution of the drug product. 
Naloxegol exposure is significantly affected by co-administration with food: exposure increases by 42% to 
55% and maximum plasma concentration increase by 30% to 47% when a 25 mg dose of naloxegol is 
administered after eating a meal, compared with fasting conditions. The magnitude of the increase for 
both AUC and Cmax appeared to be similar for all tablet formulations tested, for both the 12.5 mg and 25 
mg tablet, and between Japanese and Western volunteers. This is described in an appropriate way in the 
SmPC since naloxegol should be administered in the morning, approximately 1 hour prior to eating, in 
clinical practice to achieve similar exposure as was observed in the Phase III program. 
Distribution 
After absorption, naloxegol plasma concentrations decline bi-exponentially: naloxegol is distributed into 
a central and a peripheral compartment, with typical values for apparent volume of 160 L and 266 L, 
respectively). The mean apparent volume of distribution during the terminal phase (Vz/F) ranged 
approximately from 968 L to 2140 L across dosing groups and studies. The volume of distribution 
suggests extra-vascular distribution. Results from a QWBA (Quantitative Whole Body Autoradiography) 
study in the rat and the lack of antagonism of CNS opiate effects in humans at naloxegol doses less than 
250 mg, indicate minimal distribution of naloxegol into the CNS. 
Plasma protein binding of naloxegol in humans is low and the fraction unbound ranged from 80% to 
100%. No data were provided concerning the protein binding in renal/hepatic impaired patients nor in the 
target population. However, in view of the low degree of plasma protein binding, this is considered to be 
of no issue. 
Elimination 
The primary route of naloxegol elimination is via hepatic metabolism, with renal excretion playing a 
minimal role.  
In vitro data indicate that naloxegol is a substrate for cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and that CYP3A is 
the major CYP enzyme responsible for the metabolism of naloxegol  Naloxegol is also a substrate of the 
P-gp transporter, which likely plays a significant role in limiting CNS exposure to naloxegol and in its 
disposition.  
In clinical studies, 6 metabolites were found in either feces, urine and plasma, none of which have been 
identified as unique or disproportionate human metabolites. The major plasma circulating species is 
naloxegol. None of the metabolites was present >10% of the plasma concentrations of parent or drug 
related material. These metabolites were formed via N-dealkylation (M1) and oxidation and partial loss of 
the PEG chain (M13, M7, M12, M10, and M4). 
In the ADME study (Study D3820C00001), in which 27 mg of 14C-naloxegol was administered to healthy 
volunteers, most of the recovered radioactivity was found in feces, 67.7% of mean total recovery, with 
16.0% of mean total recovery recovered in urine. This confirms that the primary elimination pathway is 
via fecal elimination. Parent naloxegol recovered in the feces accounted for only 16.2% of the dose (out 
of the total 67.7% recovered radioactivity in the feces). Parent naloxegol dose recovered in urine was only 
5.90% of the dose. Mean cumulative recovery of radioactivity from urine and faeces (84.2%) was lower 
than expected. This is not in accordance with the recommendations of the Guideline on the Investigation 
of Drug Interactions (CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1), but the applicant discussed the lower radioactivity in 
the context of literature information showing lower recoveries for compounds predominantly excreted in 
the faeces.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/738815/2014  
Page 32/120 
 
 
 
 
 
The apparent divergence between studies, which could presume the presence of some metabolite(s) that 
represent a yet not identified important fraction of the radioactivity (ranging from 32% (at 0.5h) to 67% 
(at 6h)) has been adequately justified by the applicant. The metabolite profiling work used sample 
preparation and chromatographic separation followed by fraction collection and counting, which has lower 
sensitivity. A signal to noise cut-off (S/N>3) was applied, and then mass spectrometry (MS) detection 
was applied to the radiochemical peaks. Thus, at the dose used (27 mg) and with the amounts of 
radioactivity present in the plasma, not all the drug-related components may have been identified due to 
the sensitivity limits. This observation was confirmed by the results of study 07-IN-NX002 (250 mg dose 
group), during which a total of 17 metabolites have been identified (semi-quantitatively). It appears that 
the fraction of the radioactivity (ranging from 32% at 0.5h to 67% at 6h) is due to the presence of these 
metabolites. Most importantly, both studies show that there are no major circulating metabolites (<10% 
of drug-related material in plasma) and Study 07-IN-NX002 shows that there is no important difference 
at steady state. Therefore, the applicant’s conclusion that no further characterisations are needed for the 
metabolites is endorsed. 
At therapeutic doses, mean terminal elimination half-life values across the clinical pharmacology studies 
ranged from 6 to 11 h. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
It appears that dose proportionality could be concluded for AUC and that Cmax tends to increases more 
than proportionally with increasing doses. However, by visual inspection of the graphs, positive deviation 
from proportionality is apparent only at doses of 250 mg and higher. Further analysis showed that as long 
as the dose ratio is less or equal to 2.29, dose proportionality is to be concluded. Therefore, dose 
proportionality can be concluded for both AUC0-∞ and Cmax in the dose range 12.5 mg – 50 mg. 
Consistent with the terminal t1/2 values observed, steady state was reached after several days. The 
applicant concluded that no time-dependent changes have been observed for naloxegol. The apparent 
absence of steady state at day 8 in some of the subjects of Study 07-IN-NX002 is most probably due to 
interday variability. This was further confirmed by the comparison between the predicted and observed 
accumulation ratio at steady state which confirmed that naloxegol is not characterised by time-dependent 
PK. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
A moderate to high inter-individual variability (24.4-41.7%) and low intra-individual variability (ranging 
from 15.7% to 17.9%) have been noted for naloxegol. 
Special populations 
Patients versus volunteers 
The findings in patients with OIC are consistent with those previously reported in healthy subjects. The 
justification provided by the applicant for the higher exposure as observed in the Phase III study (error 
and uncertainty in dosing and/or sampling times, different food consumption patterns, other underlying 
medical conditions in the Phase III patient populations, and/or other unknown factors) is acceptable as in 
the Phase IIb study no trend for higher exposure has been observed. Overall, naloxegol possesses 
predictable PK characteristics and does not require complex dosing regimens or dosing adjustments to 
achieve efficacy in patients with OIC. 
Assessment report

Renal impairment 
Renal clearance is a minor route of elimination for naloxegol, regardless of severity. However, 
pharmacokinetic characterization in patients with severe renal impairment should be considered even if 
the drug is eliminated mainly by metabolism.  
A single-dose study (Study D3820C00009) to investigate renal impairment has been adequately 
performed and this single dose administration is sufficient since naloxegol exhibits linear and 
time-independent pharmacokinetics.  We can observe that naloxegol exposure is higher in patients with 
renal impairment compared to patients with OIC with normal renal function. Renal impairment has a 
greater effect on the extent of exposure (AUC0-inf) compared to peak levels (Cmax) of naloxegol.  
Overall, in severe renal impaired patients, AUC and Cmax of naloxegol increased by 117% and 84%, 
respectively, compared to patients with normal renal function. However, in 2 out of 8 patients (in both the 
moderate and severe renal impairment groups but not in the end stage renal failure group) up to 10-fold 
increases in the exposure of naloxegol were observed. As mentioned by the applicant, in these patients, 
renal impairment may adversely affect other clearance pathways (hepatic/gut drug metabolism, etc.) 
resulting in higher exposure. Therefore, the applicant agreed with a starting dose of 12.5 mg in patients 
with severe renal impairment (see section 4.2 of the SmPC). If side effects impacting tolerability occur, 
naloxegol should be discontinued. The dose can be increased to 25 mg if 12.5 mg is well tolerated by the 
patient.  
Exposure of naloxegol in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on hemodialysis was similar to healthy 
volunteers with normal renal function. 
Hepatic impairment  
It is known that following oral administration naloxegol is extensively metabolized and is excreted 
primarily in the feces (~68% of the dose). Considering the important role of hepatic involvement in 
naloxegol elimination, decreased hepatic function was thought to potentially affect naloxegol exposure. 
In this context, a single-dose study (study D3820C00010) to investigate hepatic impairment has been 
performed. A single dose administration is sufficient since naloxegol exhibit linear and time-independent 
pharmacokinetics. The effect of hepatic impairment on the pharmacokinetics of naloxegol was explored in 
subjects with mild (Childs-Pugh Class A) and moderate (Childs-Pugh Class B) impairment, compared to 
healthy matched volunteers following a 25 mg dose of naloxegol. In the study, Cmax values of naloxegol 
were similar (ratios of 0.95 and 1.00) and the AUC values were 0.83 in subjects with mild hepatic 
impairment and 0.82 in subjects with moderate hepatic impairment, when compared to volunteers with 
normal hepatic function. Less than 20% decrease in AUC and 10% decrease in Cmax were observed in 
patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh Class A and B). No dose adjustment is 
required for patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. Use in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment is adequately not recommended since effect of severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class 
C) on the pharmacokinetics of nalogexol was not evaluated. 
Gender 
Gender was found to have no effect on AUC and Cmax and it was not identified as significant covariate. 
The SmPC mentions adequately that there is no gender effect on the pharmacokinetics of naloxegol. 
Weight 
Patients with high weight had somewhat increased naloxegol exposure but the difference in exposure is 
not considered as clinically meaningful. This is reflected correctly in section 5.2 of the SmPC with the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/738815/2014  
Page 34/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mention that naloxegol exposure was found to increase with increased weight but the effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of naloxegol  is not clinically relevant. 
Race 
There  is  no  clinically  significant  effect  of  race  on  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  naloxegol,  although 
exposure was found lower in African-Americans/Blacks and, to a lesser extent, in Asians.    
Elderly 
Table  presents the number of elderly patients that participated in the naloxegol clinical programme, in 
the age groups requested by the CHMP. 
Table 2 Number of elderly patients involved across the clinical trial programme (Safety set) 
A small effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of naloxegol (approximately 0.7% increase in AUC for every 
year increase in age) is observed and no dose adjustment is recommended for older people. Patients over 
65 years of age have been represented in the phase III studies. Clinical studies of naloxegol did not 
include sufficient numbers of patients aged 75 years or over to determine whether they respond 
differently than younger patients, however, based on the mode of action of the active substance there are 
no theoretical reasons for any requirement for dose adjustments in this age group. 
Children 
No data in pediatric subjects is available. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Four potential interactions with other drugs have been correctly studied by the applicant and the results 
of these investigations have been introduced into the SmPC.   
In vitro data indicate that naloxegol is a substrate for cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and that CYP3A is 
the major CYP enzyme responsible for the metabolism of naloxegol. CYP450 enzymes are highly 
expressed in the intestinal epithelium and can be involved in pre-systemic drug metabolism along with 
first pass hepatic metabolism. Substances that inhibit or induce hepatic and gastrointestinal CYP3A4 can 
markedly affect plasma concentrations and bioavailability of CYP3A4 substrates and may result in 
significant drug interactions. Several in vivo drug interaction studies have been performed to investigate 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/738815/2014  
Page 35/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the consequences of concomitant administrations of CYP3A4 inhibitors and inducers with naloxegol. 
Naloxegol is also a substrate of the P-gp transporter, which likely plays a significant role in limiting CNS 
exposure to naloxegol and in its disposition. Therefore, the impact of P-gp induction on naloxegol 
pharmacokinetics has also been explored. 
The drug-drug interaction studies investigate the potential alterations of the disposition of naloxegol by 
drugs that interfere with CYP3A4 and P-gp as well as the potential interaction between naloxegol and 
morphine. 
Ketoconazole – DDI study n° D3820C00012 
The objective was to investigate the effect of ketoconazole on the bioavailability of naloxegol in healthy 
subjects. The study is an open-label, nonrandomized, fixed-sequence, 3-period, 3-treatment, single-dose, 
crossover study comparing the bioavailability of naloxegol when administered alone and in combination 
with ketoconazole.  
A single dose of 25 mg naloxegol was administered on Day 1 (Treatment A) followed by a 2-day washout 
(Days 2 and 3). Once-daily doses of 400 mg ketoconazole were administered from Days 4 through Day 6 
(Treatment B) and on Days 7 and 8 with coadministration of 25 mg naloxegol on Day 7 (Treatment C). 
In the presence of ketoconazole, Geometric least-squares mean naloxegol AUC(0-t) was 13.00-fold (ratio, 
90% CI: 13.00, 11.45 to 14.76) while Geometric least-squares mean naloxegol AUC(0-24) was 
12.89-fold (ratio, 90% CI: 12.89, 11.42 to 14.56) that of naloxegol administered alone. For Cmax 
Geometric least-squares mean was 9.58-fold (ratio, 90% CI: 9.58, 8.10 to 11.33) that for naloxegol 
administered alone. 
Co-administration of ketoconazole with naloxegol resulted in a high increase in the exposure of naloxegol. 
It can be clearly concluded that ketoconazole has an important impact on the PK parameters of naloxegol. 
Therefore, co-administration of naloxegol with ketoconazole, strong inhibitors of CYP3A4, is 
contraindicated. The SmPC adequately mentions that concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. 
clarithromycin, ketoconazole) can significantly increase the exposure to naloxegol and is contraindicated.  
Rifampin – DDI study n° D3820C00015 
The objective was to investigate the effect of rifampin on the bioavailability of naloxegol in healthy 
subjects. The study is an open-label, nonrandomized, fixed-sequence, 3-period, 3-treatment, single-dose, 
crossover study comparing the bioavailability of naloxegol when administered alone and in combination 
with rifampin.  
In Period 1, a single 25 mg dose of naloxegol (Treatment A) was administered orally on the morning of 
Day 1 followed by a 2-day washout (Days 2 and 3). In Period 2, once-daily doses of 600 mg rifampin 
(Treatment B) were administered from Days 4 through Day 12. In Period 3, a single dose of 25 mg 
naloxegol (Treatment C) was administered on the morning of Day 13. 
Following once daily dosing of rifampin 600mg, naloxegol exposure is greatly decreased with AUC, Cmax 
and AUC(0-8) reduced by approximately 89% (ratio, 90% CI: 0.11, 0.095 to 0.12),  approximately 76% 
(ratio, 90% CI: 0.24, 0.20 to 0.31) and approximately 87% (ratio, 90% CI: 0.13, 0.11 to 0.14)  
respectively. 
Administration of rifampin significantly decreased exposure to naloxegol. The SmPC mentions that 
naloxegol is not recommended in patients who are taking strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, 
rifampin, St. John’s wort). Moreover, the SmPC specifies that concomitant use with P-gp inducers, which 
are also strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, rifampin, St. John’s wort) is not recommended.

Naloxegol is proved to be a substrate for CYP3A4 and also a substrate of the P-gp transporter. Rifampin, 
a potent CYP3A4 inducer and P-glycoprotein efflux inducer widely affects the PK of naloxegol. This is 
clearly mentioned in the SmPC that concomitant administration of naloxegol with strong inducers of 
CYP3A4 (and P-gp) is not recommended. 
Diltiazem – DDI study n° D3820C00032 
The objective was to investigate the effect of coadministration of diltiazem on the bioavailability of 
naloxegol in healthy subjects. The study is an open-label, nonrandomized, fixed-sequence, 3-period, 
3-treatment, single-dose, crossover study comparing the bioavailability of naloxegol when administered 
alone and in combination with diltiazem.  
In Period 1, a single 25-mg dose of naloxegol (Treatment A) was administered orally on the morning of 
Day 1 followed by a 2-day washout (Days 2 and 3). In Period 2, once-daily doses of 240-mg diltiazem 
extended release (XR) (Treatment B) were administered from Days 4 through Day 6. In Period 3, a single 
dose of 240-mg diltiazem XR plus a single dose of 25-mg naloxegol (Treatment C) was administered on 
the morning of Day 7 and a single dose of 240-mg diltiazem XR was administered on Day 8. 
Co-administration of diltiazem with naloxegol resulted in 3.44-fold (ratio, 90% CI: 3.44, 3.19 to 3.72), 
3.41-fold (ratio, 90% CI: 3,41, 3.16 to 3.68) and 2.86-fold (ratio, 90% CI: 2.86, 2.59 to 3.15) increase 
in naloxegol AUC(0-t), AUC(0-24) and Cmax, respectively. 
Based on these results, a statistically significant effect of diltiazem on the pharmacokinetic of naloxegol 
can be concluded. The conclusions are that a dose-adjustment of naloxegol is recommended when 
co-administered with diltiazem and other moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors. This is described in an appropriate 
way in the SmPC which mentions that the starting dose for patients who are taking moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitors (e.g. diltiazem, verapamil) is 12.5 mg once daily. The dose can be increased to 25 mg if 
12.5 mg is well tolerated by the patient. 
Quinidine and morphine – DDI study n° D3820C00011  
The objectives of the study n°D3820C00011 are to investigate the effects of quinidine (Part 1) and 
morphine (Part 2) on the bioavailability of naloxegol in healthy subjects. The study is a double-blind (with 
regard to quinidine administration), randomized, 2-part, 2-period, 2-treatment, single-dose, crossover 
study comparing the bioavailability of naloxegol when administered alone and in combination with 
quinidine and/or morphine.  
In Part 1, Period 1 on Day 1, volunteers received a single oral dose of naloxegol 25 mg and quinidine 
placebo (Treatment A) or naloxegol 25 mg and quinidine 600 mg (Treatment B). Following a minimum 
7-day washout period between dose administration, volunteers received the alternate treatment on Day 
1 of Period 2.  
Following a washout period of 7 days, a subset of volunteers returned to the clinic for Part 2. On Day 1 of 
Part 2, Period 3, volunteers received either Treatment C (a single oral dose of naloxegol 25 mg and 
quinidine placebo and i.v. administration of 5mg/70 kg morphine) or Treatment D (a single oral dose of 
naloxegol 25 mg and quinidine 600 mg and i.v. administration of 5mg/70 kg morphine). Following a 
minimum 7-day washout period between dose administration, volunteers received the alternate 
treatment on Day 1 of Period 4.  
Co-administration of quinidine led to an increase in naloxegol AUC(0-t) by 1.41% (90% CI: 1.34 to 1.49), 
AUC(0-24) by 1.63% (90% CI: 1.48 to 1.80) and Cmax by 2.47% ( 90% CI: 2.19 to 2.78) compared with 
naloxegol alone.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/738815/2014  
Page 37/120 
 
 
 
 
 
The relative bioavailabilities of naloxegol after combined treatment with morphine compared with 
monotherapy were also estimated based on geometric mean ratios of AUC, AUC(0-24) and Cmax and 
their 90% confidence intervals (CIs). All 90% CIs were not entirely contained within the standard 
bioequivalence boundaries of 80.00 to 125.00 %. 
Based on standard BE boundaries, co-administration of the P-gp inhibitor quinidine had clinically relevant 
effect on the PK of naloxegol. The SmPC specifies that P-gp inhibitors typically have concomitant effect on 
CYP3A4 that can be classified as weak (e.g. quinidine), moderate (e.g. diltiazem), or strong (e.g. 
ketocanozole). For all P-gp inhibitors (regardless of the degree of inhibition of P-gp), dosing 
recommendations should follow the concomitant CYP3A4 effect (e.g. dual strong CYP3A4/P-gp inhibitor 
follow strong CYP3A4 recommendation) 
The 90% CIs of the geometric LS ratios of naloxegol Cmax (and not AUC) in the presence of morphine 
were slightly outside the standard bioequivalence range (0.78 – 1.19). However, the applicant states the 
geometric LS mean ratios of the naloxegol for Treatment C versus Treatment A showed that AUC, 
AUC(0-24) and Cmax in the presence of morphine were similar compared to naloxegol alone. Moreover, 
it should be noted that this was a post-hoc analysis, and the study was not powered to assess 
bioequivalence of the PK of naloxegol when co-administered with morphine. 
In conclusion, the effect of potent inhibitor and inducer of CYP3A4 on the naloxegol pharmacokinetics is 
correctly investigated. The SmPC mentions correctly that concomitant administration of naloxegol with 
strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g. clarithromycin, ketoconazole) as well as with potent CYP3A4/P-gp 
inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, rifampin, St. John’s wort) of CYP3A4 is contraindicated. The moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitor used concomitantly with naloxegol (diltiazem) was adequately investigated. Increase in 
oral naloxegol exposure has been observed, leading to a dose-adjustment in the SmPC of naloxegol when 
co-administratered with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. diltiazem, verapamil). An additional in vivo 
drug interaction study with quinidine, a Pgp inhibitor and morphine was also carried out. As result dosing 
recommendations for naloxegol with all P-gp inhibitors have been mentioned in an appropriate way.  
An adequate physiologically-based pharmacokinetics (PBPK) modelling was conducted to predict the 
effect of various inhibitors concomitantly administered in the phase III program. The PBPK model was 
constructed by integrating physiochemical properties, in-vitro metabolism data and in-vivo ketoconazole 
interaction information. The model was then applied and reasonably predicted other clinical DDI studies, 
ie, diltiazem and rifampin studies. The model has been then applied to moderate and weak CYP3A 
inhibitors which have been simulated for co-administration with naloxegol in phase 3 studies. The results 
obtained indicate that the AUC and Cmax ratios with strong, moderate and weak CYP3A/P-gp inhibitors 
and inducers were in agreement with the ratios observed in DDI studies of naloxegol.  
As the dissolution and the solubility of naloxegol are pH independent, absorption of naloxegol is unlikely 
to be affected by drugs that increase gastric pH, eg, proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), H2-receptor 
antagonists, or antacids. 
Concerning the potential interaction of naloxegol with oral contraceptives, the applicant has provided the 
results of the assessment based on in vitro inhibition and induction data to investigate the potential for 
these drug interactions. From the results of the assessment, naloxegol is considered unlikely to affect the 
efficacy of these medicinal products. Consequently, the applicant’s position that no DDIs should be 
initiated for the hormonal contraceptive agents is endorsed.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Naloxegol functions as a peripherally-acting mu-opioid receptor antagonist in the gastrointestinal tract, 
thereby decreasing the constipating effects of opioids without impacting opioid-mediated analgesic 
effects on the central nervous system. 
Naloxegol is a PEGylated derivative of the mu-opioid receptor antagonist naloxone. PEGylation reduces 
naloxegol’s passive permeability and also renders the compound a substrate for the P-glycoprotein 
transporter. Due to poorer permeability and increased efflux of naloxegol across the blood-brain barrier, 
related to P-gp substrate properties, the CNS penetration of naloxegol is minimal. 
In vitro studies demonstrate that naloxegol is a full neutral antagonist at the mu-opioid receptor. 
Naloxegol acts by binding to mu-opioid receptors in the GI tract targeting the underlying causes of OIC 
(i.e. reduced GI motility, hypertonicity and increased fluid absorption resulting from long-term opioid 
treatment). 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Antagonism of morphine’s peripheral and central nervous system effects 
The capacity of naloxegol to antagonize the reduced gastrointestinal motility caused by morphine while 
not antagonizing of the effect of morphine on the central nervous system was investigated in Study 
05-IN-OX001. Gastrointestinal motility was assessed by measuring orocecal transit time via the lactulose 
hydrogen breath test. Central nervous system effects were assessed by measuring antagonism of 
morphine-induced pupil constriction (ie, miosis). 
Morphine was administered intravenously at a dose of 5 mg/70kg. Baseline orocecal transit times in 
healthy volunteers were established with the administration of lactulose with morphine placebo and 
naloxegol placebo. Volunteers then received lactulose with morphine and naloxegol and lactulose with 
morphine and placebo in a randomised crossover fashion, to determine the effect naloxegol on 
morphine-induced delay in orocecal transit time. In general, most subjects receiving intravenous 
morphine with placebo had at least a doubling in orocecal transit when compared to their baseline 
measurement. Large between subject variability was observed in orocecal transit times for morphine + 
placebo (21 to 290 minutes) as well as for morphine + naloxegol (20 to 245 minutes); thus, percent 
change in orocecal transit time was expressed relative to the subject’s morphine + placebo value in an 
attempt to compensate for these between-subject differences. Median, minimum, and maximum percent 
changes in orocecal transit time when naloxegol was co-administered with morphine, compared to 
morphine alone, are presented in table 3. 
Assessment report

Page 39/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 3 Percent change in orocecal transit times in subjects receiving naloxegol 
Table 3 shows an increased percent reduction in the orocecal transit with increasing naloxegol dose with 
an apparent plateau at doses ≥125 mg. 
Pupil diameter was also measured with a pupillometer under both morphine + naloxegol treatment and 
morphine + placebo treatment to determine the degree of antagonism of morphine-induced miosis by 
naloxegol. Individual cohorts received naloxegol doses of 8 mg, 15 mg, 30 mg, 60 mg, 125 mg, 250 mg, 
500 mg, and 1000 mg. 
Administration of morphine with placebo produced sustained miosis in the majority of subjects, as 
expected. Pupil diameter-time profiles after both the naloxegol and placebo treatments were essentially 
superimposable in all volunteers with the exception of 2 volunteers: 1 of 6 volunteers at the 250 mg dose 
level and 1 of 6 volunteers at the 1000 mg dose level, who had a possible attenuation of 
morphine-induced miosis after receiving morphine with naloxegol. Thus, naloxegol did not diminish 
morphine-induced miosis in a dose-dependent manner, and no diminution was observed at doses of 125 
mg or lower. 
Study D3820C00011 examined the effect of the co-administration of the P-gp inhibitor quinidine on the 
lack of antagonism of morphine-induced miosis exhibited by naloxegol. The peak miotic effect due to 
intravenous morphine administration was similar during both the naloxegol and the naloxegol + quinidine 
treatments, with peak decrease in pupil diameter of 1.09 mm in the absence of quinidine and 1.16 mm in 
the presence of quinidine. 
Effect of naloxegol on QTc interval 
There is no evidence that naloxegol prolongs the QT interval. In vitro, naloxegol was found to have no 
activity at the hERG-encoded potassium channel (IC50 >300 μM). 
Results of a thorough QT study (D3820C00014) showed that single oral 25 mg and 150 mg doses of 
naloxegol did not prolong QTcF beyond 10 msec. The largest placebo-corrected mean change from 
baseline in QTcF occurred at 2 hours post-dose for the 25 mg dose and 1.5 hours dose for the 150 mg 
supra-therapeutic dose. The upper bounds of the 2-sided 90% CI were 2.9 msec for the 25 mg dose and 
4.9 msec for the 150 mg dose, respectively. In addition, single 25 mg and 150 mg doses did not increase 
the incidence of QTcF intervals more than 450 msec and did not increase the QTcF interval more than 30 
msec.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Naloxegol is PEG naloxol, also known as a PEGylated derivative of naloxone. It is a substrate of the 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) transporter, which substantially limits its ability to cross the BBB. Naloxegol, by 
binding to μ-opioid receptors within the GI tract targets the underlying causes of OIC. With its antagonist 
effects essentially restricted to the opioid receptors located outside the CNS, naloxegol is expected to 
alleviate OIC without reducing the central analgesic effects of opioids. 
The applicant has performed a comprehensive PK program, consisting of 14 Phase I studies. Naloxegol 
was administered to 398 healthy volunteers. In addition, 24 subjects with renal function impairment and 
16 subjects with hepatic function impairment received naloxegol. Among the healthy volunteers, there 
were 40 Japanese volunteers that received naloxegol, including 6 elderly Japanese volunteers, in a study 
performed in Japan. Additional pharmacokinetic data is reported from 22 patients with opioid-induced 
constipation that receive naloxegol in a Phase IIb study.  
Conventional studies with non-compartmental analysis as well as pop PK have been performed. The 
analytical methods are well validated and appear satisfactory in performance.  
The bridging between the different formulations used during the development is done both by in vitro and 
in vivo comparative studies according to the document ‘Questions & Answers: Positions on specific 
questions addressed to the pharmacokinetics working party’ (EMA/618604/2008 Rev.8). Bioequivalence 
has been shown between the formulations used during phase I, II, III and the final marketing 
formulation. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The Pharmacodynamic study data do not point to major safety concerns with regard to the use of 
naloxegol within the context of these studies. In a first study, it was demonstrated that PEG7-Naloxol 
antagonized morphine-induced delay in oral cecal transit time in a dose dependent manner. In addition, 
a second study could not detect reproducibly dose-dependent reversal of morphine-induced miosis 
symptoms. Statistically significant decreases in pupil diameter at 2 time points upon administration of 
naloxegol+quinidine compared to naloxegol only (with direction of change opposite to what was 
expected) were not considered to be clinically relevant. Assessment of QTcF versus RR intervals indicated 
that QTcF was adequately corrected for RR interval. No major safety issues were identified in the 
presented pharmacodynamics studies.

2.5.1.  Dose response study 
Study 07-IN-NX003 
This was a multicenter, international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, dose 
escalation study of the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of NKTR-118 in patients with documented OIC. 
The diagnosis of OIC was confirmed during a 2-week screening period. 
Methods 
•  Study participants  
Patients needed to meet all of the following criteria for inclusion in the study:  
o  Adult patients who received a stable opioid regimen (a total daily dose 30 – 1000 MEU), 
for minimum of 2 weeks prior to screening for non-malignant pain or cancer-related pain 
o  Documented OIC with <5 SBMs confirmed over the 2-week OIC screening period with >1 
self-reported symptom of OIC (hard/lumpy stools, straining, or sensation of incomplete 
evacuation/anorectal obstruction), as well as self-reported OIC (< 3 SBMs/week),  
Patients presenting any of the following conditions were not included in the trial: 
o  Fecal incontinence, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, intestinal 
obstruction, or other active medical disorders associated with diarrhea or intermittent 
loose stools or constipation; 
o  Brain metastases, epidural metastases, malignant tumor of the brain, multiple sclerosis, 
or any other condition that may have affected the permeability of the blood-brain barrier. 
o  History of ischemic heart disease or a screening ECG compatible with ischemic heart 
disease, or any other medical condition that may have unduly increased risk to the 
patient or may have affected the interpretation of study data (eg, inadequately controlled 
clinical depression, ventricular arrhythmias, poorly controlled seizure disorder). 
o  Severe background pain (eg, typical average daily pain intensity rating of 7 to 10 on an 
11-point NRS refractory to opioid therapy). 
Treatments 
All patients randomized following successful completion of the 2-week OIC screening period entered the 
1-week placebo run-in period, during which they received a single morning dose of placebo. After the 
placebo run-in period, patients were received single daily oral doses of either placebo or NKTR-118, 
according to their randomization assignment, for 4 weeks. Patients randomized to active treatment were 
provided NKTR-118 as oral solution at a dose of 5 mg (Cohort 1), 25 mg (Cohort 2), or 50 mg (Cohort 3). 
A dose of 38 mg was planned for inclusion in Cohort 4; however, enrollment in this cohort was never 
initiated. The doses of NKTR-118 were originally scheduled to be 5 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg QD. 
Upon review of safety and tolerability data from the 50 mg dose cohort, it was decided to complete 
enrolment and study participation for this dose cohort. It was suggested to take into consideration an 
intermediary dose of NKTR-118, such as 37.5 mg. After a preliminary analysis was performed on the first 
3 groups (5, 25 and 50 mg), the Sponsor decided to end the study after completion of the third cohort.

Study 07-IN-NX003 Flow Chart 
Objectives 
Primary Objective 
• 
Primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of NKTR-118 at various dose levels, with efficacy 
defined as the change from baseline in the number of spontaneous bowel movements (SBMs) per 
week. 
Secondary Objectives 
• 
The main secondary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of NKTR-118, thereby 
enabling identification of an effective dose that preserves opioid-conferred analgesia 
•  Delineate dose-response for NKTR-118 across a range of underlying opioid doses, with response 
defined as the change from baseline in SBMs/week 
•  Characterize the PK of NKTR-118 in patients 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint: 
• 
The primary efficacy variable was the change from baseline in SBMs/week at Visit 6 (end of 
double-blind study treatment period Week 1) and defined as SBMs/week during the first week of 
double-blind study treatment period (between Visit 4 and Visit 6) minus baseline SBMs/week. 
Baseline was defined as the average SBMs/week during the 2-week OIC screening period. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: 
•  Change from baseline in SBMs/week during double-blind study treatment period Weeks 2, 3, and 
4. 
•  Change from baseline in SBMs/week across the 28-day double-blind period. 
• 
Time from first dose of the study treatment in the double-blind period to first laxation. 
•  Dose-response relationship with response defined as change from baseline in the number of 
SBMs/week. 
•  Clinical laboratory evaluation of FSH, LH, testosterone, prolactin, and estradiol.

• 
PAC-SYM,  PAC-QOL, and SF-36 at Visit 4 (Day 1 of double blind treatment period prior to first 
dose of the study treatment), Visit 7 (Day 1 of Week 4 of double blind study treatment period), 
Visit 9 (end of double-blind study treatment period). 
Secondary safety endpoints included the following: 
•  Opioid withdrawal symptoms as measured by the COWS scheduled 3 times during the trial (at the 
beginning of the placebo run-in period; two hours after the initial dose; three days after the initial 
dose 
•  Daily opioid requirement and mean and maximal daily NRS score 
•  Daily bisacodyl rescue medication 
•  Adverse events: TEAEs, SAEs, study discontinuation due to AEs, adverse events of special 
interest 
•  Clinical laboratory evaluation: 
Pharmacokinetics: 
The endpoints for the PK analyses included standard non-compartmental PK parameters derived from 
plasma concentration data. 
Sample size 
This study planned to enrol up to 4 sequential dose cohorts comprising approximately 240 patients. A 
common SD of 3.5 SBMs/week was selected based on published data from similar studies. It was 
assumed that the number of SBMs per week would increase more prominently among patients on 
NKTR-118 compared with patients receiving placebo with a mean difference of ≥2.5 SBMs/week. A 
sample size of 27 patients in each treatment group in the first 3 cohorts (5 mg, 25 mg, and 50 mg) had 
80% power to detect a difference in means of 2.5 SBMs between NKTR-118 and placebo assuming a 
common SD of 3.5 SBMs with a 0.10 2-sided significance level using a Mann-Whitney test. 
Randomisation 
Each screened patient was assigned a unique patient number. Patients were randomized, received a 
unique randomization number, and entered the placebo run-in period followed by the 4-week randomized 
treatment period. Randomization was stratified by total daily opioid dose at screening in MEU (low, 30 to 
100 MEU; high, > 100 to 1000 MEU).  
Following database lock, it was identified that MEU conversion for baseline opioid use for stratification was 
not performed consistently by the study sites for some patients. Therefore, MEU conversion for baseline 
opioid use was recalculated. 
Blinding (masking) 
A computer-generated randomization scheme was stratified by baseline opioid use (low/high). Study 
medication (NKTR-118 and placebo) bottles, bottle cartons, and syringe cartons were prepared for dosing 
and labelled at least the following information: the protocol number, blinded name/code of the drug, the 
route of administration, the patient number, patient initials, date of dispensing, lot number, expiry date, 
and any required cautionary statements.  
Syringes were labelled with the protocol number, blinded name/code of the drug, patient number, date of 
dispensing, and expiry date.  
Assessment report

The site pharmacist and/or the designated staff who diluted study medication were the only people at the 
site handling the study medication bottles including: receipt at the site, weekly study medication dilution 
and preparation of the patient syringes, and drug bottle/kit accountability.  
An unblinded site monitor monitored drug accountability and returned the drug accountability form, along 
with the used and unused bottles of study medication, to the study medication distributor where a second 
reconciliation was conducted and documented.  
Study coordinators and blinded site monitors only reported on accountability of the patient oral syringes. 
Study coordinators and blinded monitors may have opened the syringe cartons, performed a count of 
returned oral syringes, and checked to see if plungers had been depressed (indicating dispensing of study 
medication by patient). 
Statistical methods 
Analysis of the primary endpoint was conducted based on the modified intent-to-treat (MITT) population. 
The primary endpoint was summarized by cohort and treatment group.  
The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare the treatment groups (NKTR-118 vs. placebo) within 
each cohort. The Wilcoxon signed rank test was used for the within group comparisons.  
An exact Wilcoxon rank sum test was performed as a supplementary analysis for the primary endpoint to 
confirm that the normal approximation provides results sufficiently close to those of the exact test to give 
confidence in using the normal approximation for the Wilcoxon rank sum tests of all secondary endpoints.  
The reported P values for Wilcoxon rank sum test and exact Wilcoxon rank sum test were sufficiently close 
throughout the efficacy endpoints analyses. Therefore the P values based on Wilcoxon rank sum test were 
reported in this clinical study report. Consistent with the protocol, an exact stratified Wilcoxon rank sum 
test (with a stratification factor of baseline opioid dose) was performed as a supplementary analysis for 
the primary endpoint.

More patients were enrolled in the high-baseline opioid stratum (n = 116) compared with the low-baseline 
opioid stratum (n = 91). A slightly higher proportion of patients in the high-baseline opioid stratum 
completed the placebo run-in (97.4% vs. 88.0%). 
The majority of patients (160 [76.9%]) completed the study, including the follow-up period. A similar 
number of patients in the low- and high-baseline opioid stratums (71 [77.2%] and 91 [78.4%], 
respectively) completed the double-blind study period. 
Thirty-two (15.4%) patients withdrew during the double-blind period. The most frequent reason for 
discontinuation was AEs (15 patients [46.9%]); the majority of these patients (10 [71.4%]) were in the 
NKTR-118 treatment arm of Cohort 3 (50 mg) and in the high-baseline opioid stratum (8 patients 
[72.7%]). 
Recruitment 
The study was initiated 04 January 2008 (First patient enrolled) and finished at 23 March 2009 (Last 
patient completed). 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was issued on 20 Sep 2007 and was amended 6 times.  
The finalized SAP indicated that the MITT is the primary analysis population. The SAP indicated that 
analysis of the efficacy endpoints will be also conducted on per-protocol population as a secondary 
analysis. The finalized SAP indicated that the secondary endpoint of time to first laxation will be calculated 
in days. After finalization of the SAP, it was decided that this endpoint will be calculated in hours in order 
to be consistent with published literature.  
According to the SAP, no statistical testing of time to first SBM was planned. However, post-hoc inferential 
comparison of NKTR-118 and placebo within each cohort was conducted using log-rank test and 
corresponding P values were presented.  
A Kaplan-Meier summary of time to withdrawal due to bisacodyl rescue failure which was planned in the 
final SAP was not produced. There was no subject who withdrew due to bisacodyl rescue failure. For the 
COWS scores categorical analysis, the SAP specified that Cochran-Mantel test will be used. However, after 
finalization of the SAP and during programming of the analysis it became use Fisher’s exact test instead.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/738815/2014  
Page 50/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
According to the protocol, all statistical testing will be conducted at the 0.10 two-sided significance level. 
During development of the SAP and prior to unblinding of the data, it was decided to conduct statistical 
tests at the 0.05 two-sided significance level.  
Major Protocol Violations Identified at Study Conclusion, was not produced because after reviewing all 
protocol deviations, all violations were considered equally important and it was decided not to 
differentiate between major and minor protocol deviations.  
Following database lock, it was identified that MEU conversion for baseline opioid use for stratification was 
not performed consistently by the study sites for some patients. Therefore, MEU conversion for baseline 
opioid use was recalculated and corrected tables and figures were generated.  
For the AE, the SAP specified using entire safety population. Only those patients were included who 
entered the double-blind period since these were more relevant to double-blind study treatment.  
The SAP specified NRS scores to be analyzed in the OIC screening, placebo run-in, and double blind 
periods. NRS scores were not collected during OIC screening, hence placebo run-in was treated as 
baseline in the analysis. 
Baseline data 
The majority of patients in the MITT population were female (62.2%) and Caucasian (86.5%). The mean 
patient age was 49.7 years, with a range of 21 to 80 years. Baseline mean PT and PTT were similar across 
all cohorts and active and placebo patients. A total of 194 patients received at least 1 dose of double-blind 
study medication. 
No patients tested positive for urinary cocaine at baseline and 1 (0.5%) placebo patient in Cohort 3 (50 
mg) tested positive for urinary cannabinoids at baseline; however, 7 patients (3.8%) tested positive for 
urinary amphetamines. Distribution of positive patients was across all treatment groups except the 
NKTR-118 arm of Cohort 1 (5 mg).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint for this study was change from baseline in SBMs/week to the end of the first week 
of double-blind study drug administration.  
For Cohort 1 (5 mg), the mean change in SBMs/week from baseline to the end of Week 1 was 2.6 for 
NKTR-118 patients and 1.8 for placebo patients. The primary endpoint for the 5 mg group was not 
statistically significant.  
For Cohort 2 (25 mg), the mean change in SBMs/week from baseline to the end of Week 1 was 3.6 for 
NKTR-118 patients and 1.9 for placebo patients. The primary endpoint for the 25 mg group was 
statistically significant (P = 0.0020).  
Assessment report

Page 51/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For Cohort 3 (50 mg), the mean change in SBMs/week from baseline to the end of Week 1 was 4.4 for 
NKTR-118 patients and 1.9 for placebo patients. The primary endpoint for the 50 mg group was 
statistically significant (P = 0.0001). It is important to note that for all the analyzed cohorts (Cohort 1, 2, 
and 3), statistically significant effects were observed (p<0.0001; p<0.0001; and 0.0011) in the placebo 
subgroups. 
In addition to the primary efficacy analysis, the change in weekly SBM frequency was also studied. The 
mean number of SBMs/week across the 28-day double-blind period increased with each successive 
dosing cohort, from 4.2 SBMs/week for 5 mg patients to 4.6 SBMs/week for 25 mg patients to 6.2 
SBMs/week for 50 mg patients. However the formal statistical analysis was not performed. 
Secondary Endpoints 
•  Change from Baseline in SBMs/Week during Weeks 2, 3, and 4  
For Cohort 1 (5 mg), the mean change in SBMs/week from baseline during Weeks 2, 3, and 4 were not 
statistically significant for NKTR-118 patients compared to placebo patients (p= 0.8793, p=0.3529, p= 
0.7618, respectively). For Cohorts  2 (25 mg) and 3 (50 mg), the mean change in SBMs/week from 
baseline during Weeks 2, 3, and 4 (except week 2, for Cohort 2, p=0.0961) were statistically significant. 
For Cohort 2 (25 mg), the mean change in SBMs/week from baseline during Weeks 3 and 4 were 
significant (P =0.0092 and P = 0.0002, respectively). For Cohort 3 (50 mg), the mean change in 
SBMs/week from baseline during Weeks 2, 3, and 4 were statistically significant (P = <0.0001, P = 
<0.0001, and P = 0.0002, respectively). 
•  Change from Baseline in SBMs/Week Across the 28-day Double-Blind Period 
For Cohort 1 (5 mg), the mean change in SBMs/week from baseline across the 28-day double blind period 
was not statistically significant. For Cohort 2 (25 mg), the mean change was 3.2 for NKTR-118 patients 
and 1.7 for placebo patients. This secondary endpoint for the 25 mg group was statistically significant (P 
= 0.0022). For Cohort 3 (50 mg), the mean change was 4.6 for NKTR-118 patients and 1.2 for placebo 
patients. This secondary endpoint for the 50 mg group was statistically significant (P = <0.0001). 
• 
Time to First Laxation 
The time to first laxation was not statistically significantly different between NKTR-118 (5 mg) and 
placebo groups, with respective median time to first laxation of 6.2 vs 28.2 hours. The time to first 
laxation was statistically significantly shorter in the NKTR-118 (25 mg) and (50 mg) cohorts compared to 
placebo with respective P = 0.0012 and P = 0.0016. The median time to first laxation for NKTR-118 (25 
mg) vs placebo was 6.6 vs 48.6 hours and was 2.9 vs 44.9 hours for NKTR-118 (50 mg) vs placebo. 
Laboratory Evaluation of FSH, LH, Testosterone, Prolactin, and Estradiol 
There were no meaningful changes in the levels of the hormones evaluated in this study. 
•  Health Outcomes Assessments: PAC-SYM, PAC-QOL, and SF-36 
The majority of mean PAC-SYM scores at all post dose time points for abdominal symptoms, rectal 
symptoms, stool symptoms, and the total mean scores were <2 at most double-blind time points, 
indicating mild gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms for placebo and NKTR-118 patients. The group receiving 
NKTR-118 5 mg did not differ from the placebo group at any of the time points (double blind week 2 and 
4) for any of PAC-SYM scale scores. The group receiving NKTR-118 25 mg exhibited significant statistical 
differences in terms of: Rectal symptoms (p=0.0496), Stool symptoms (p=0.0100) and Total score 
(p=0.0163) at Visit 7 (double blind week 2); as well as in terms of Stool symptoms (p=0.0335) at Visit 9 
(double blind week 4). Except for Rectal symptoms at Visit 9 (double blind week 4) (p=0.0116), the 
Assessment report

administration of NKTR-118 50 mg did not bring about significant changes in comparison to placebo as 
measured by the PAC-SYM scale. NKTR-118 patients in 2 cohorts (except 5 mg cohort) reported 
statistically significant greater satisfaction compared with placebo patients as measured by the PAC-QOL. 
At the same time, in the other subscales of PAC-QOL (Physical Discomfort, Worries/Concerns, 
Psychosocial Discomfort) no significant differences were observed in comparison to placebo for all 
analyzed doses of NKTR-118, except for Physical Discomfort in the NKTR-118 25 mg group at Visit 7 
(double blind week 2). NKTR-118 25 mg patients experienced statistically significant SF-36 scale scores 
that were higher than placebo for physical functioning at Visit 7 (DB Week 2), mental health at Visit 7 (DB 
Week 2) and Visit 9 (DB Week 4), and social functioning at Visit 9 (DB Week 4). At any other post-dose 
time points there were no statistically significant differences between NKTR-118 and placebo groups. 
Post hoc analysis showed that the proportion of responders (i.e., patients who showed an increase of ≥ 2 
SBMs/week from baseline) across the 28-day double-blind period was significantly higher in the 
NKTR-118 group vs. placebo group in both the 25 mg (75% vs. 26%) and 50 mg cohorts (92% vs. 29%; 
P = 0.0003 and P = 0.0001, respectively). However, the difference between the NKTR-118 and placebo 
groups in the 5 mg cohort was not statistically significant. 
Pharmacokinetics results 
NKTR-118 was rapidly absorbed independent of dose and duration of dosing. Systemic exposure to 
NKTR-118 was dose proportional, and the elimination rate was independent of dose. Pharmacokinetic 
steady-state was achieved rapidly with no appreciable accumulation occurring after QD dosing. There 
were no differences in PK characteristics between males and females.  
Glucuronidation of NKTR-118 is a minor metabolic pathway. No metabolite exceeded 10% in abundance 
relative to parent NKTR-118 in plasma or urine and no metabolite accumulated after 28 days of dosing. 
Further, no indication of induction or inhibition of any metabolic pathway was observed during the 28-day 
dosing period. The observed lack of accumulation after QD dosing is consistent with the trend in pre-dose 
concentration values, dose proportional PK, and apparent terminal elimination half life (t½) values 
typically less than the dosing interval observed in this study. The following table shows the mean 
NKTR-118 PK parameters in the evaluable PK population All of these findings are consistent with those 
previously reported following administration of NKTR-118 in healthy subjects. Overall, NKTR-118 
possesses predictable PK characteristics and does not require complex dosing regimens or dosing 
adjustments to achieve efficacy in patients with OIC.

Summary of main efficacy results 
This study demonstrated that NKTR-118 can effectively reverse OIC, without compromising analgesia or 
inducing withdrawal symptoms, in patients who received a stable opioid regimen across a wide range of 
opioid doses (30 mg to 1000 mg daily of oral morphine, or equianalgesic amounts).

When PK and efficacy data were compared, an exposure response relationship between the primary 
efficacy endpoint and NKTR-118 systemic exposure was identified. An increase of approximately 4 
SBMs/week from baseline that was sustained throughout the study was associated with the 2 higher 
doses of NKTR-118 (25 mg and 50 mg). 
During double-blind treatment, NKTR-118 patients had more SBMs than placebo patients at all post dose 
time points. The mean number of SBMs/week increased with each NKTR-118 dose, from 4.2 SBMs/week 
(5 mg) to 4.6 SBMs/week (25 mg) to 6.2 SBMs/week (50 mg). NKTR-118 in Cohort 1 (5 mg) was not 
more effective than placebo in increasing SBMs among low-baseline opioid stratum patients; however, 
NKTR-118 was more effective than placebo in increasing SBMs among the high-baseline opioid stratum 
patients. NKTR-118 patients in Cohort 2 (25 mg) and Cohort 3 (50 mg) had more SBMs/week compared 
with placebo patients in both the low and high-baseline opioid strata. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Study 04 (Study Code D3820C00004) 
This was a Phase III, multi-centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study of 
2 doses of NKTR-118 (25 mg and 12.5 mg) and placebo in patients with non-cancer-related pain and 
Opioid-Induced Constipation (OIC), conducted in Australia, Germany, Slovakia, and the US. The study 
duration was up to 18 weeks, consisting of an initial screening period lasting up to 2 weeks, a 2-week OIC 
confirmation period, during which the diagnosis of OIC and stability of the opioid regimen were confirmed, 
a 12-week treatment period, and a follow-up visit 2 weeks after the last dose of study drug. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
The naloxegol phase III program targeted recruitment of a patient population that is representative of the 
intended OIC population. 
Main inclusion criteria 
The study enrolled adult patients: 
  whose OIC diagnosis had been confirmed prospectively with a 2 week daily diary; 
  who were receiving a stable maintenance opioid regimen for non-cancer-related pain; 
 
and who reported a history of <3 SBMs/week and at least 1 OIC-associated symptom at screening 
and confirmed diagnosis of OIC. 
Main exclusion criteria 
Patients presenting any of the following conditions were not included in the trial: 
 
 
 
 
patients with pre-existing constipation for reasons other than opioid treatment, or patients who 
had diarrhea; 
patients with potentially weakened integrity of the GI wall, due to risk for bowel perforation; 
patients who required concomitant prohibited medication (ie, strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or 
p-GP, opioid antagonists and mixed agonists/antagonists, and laxatives); 
patients with potential for blood-brain barrier disruptions (eg, active multiple sclerosis, advanced 
Alzheimer’s disease, uncontrolled epilepsy); 
Assessment report

 
 
patients with cancer pain; 
and patients with recent history of myocardial infarction (MI), symptomatic congestive heart 
failure, or any other overt CV disease. 
Target subject population and sample size 
Adult patients who were receiving a stable maintenance opioid regimen (total daily dose of 30 to 1000 mg 
of oral morphine, or equianalgesic amount[s] of 1 or more other opioid therapies for a minimum of 4 
weeks) for non-cancer-related pain and who reported a history of <3 spontaneous bowel movements 
(SBMs)/week and at least 1 OIC associated symptom at screening and had a confirmed diagnosis of OIC 
were eligible to be randomized. 
Confirmed OIC was defined as: documented <3 SBMs/week on average over the 2-week OIC 
confirmation period. Patients with uneven distribution of SBMs across the 2-week OIC confirmation period 
(0 SBMs in 1 week with ≥4 SBMs in the other week) were to be excluded. In addition to the SBM frequency 
criterion, patients must have reported ≥1 of the following symptoms in at least 25% of the bowel 
movements (BMs) recorded in the electronic diary during the OIC confirmation period: Bristol Stool Scale 
stool type 1 or 2; moderate, severe, or very severe straining; incomplete BM. Patients who had 0 BMs 
over the 2-week OIC confirmation period were not randomized. 
In addition, a minimum of 50% of patients were to meet the following criteria for being laxative 
inadequate responders (LIR): Patient must have been taking 1 laxative class for a minimum of 4 days out 
of the 14 days prior to the screening visit and report moderate, severe, or very severe symptoms in at 
least 1 of the 4 stool symptom domains to qualify for assessment of LIR. 
To provide an adequate power to detect a treatment difference in the LIR subgroup (assuming LIR is 50% 
of the total study population), it was recommended that 210 patients per group (total 630 patients for 3 
treatment groups) be randomized to the study.  
Treatments 
NKTR-118 12.5 or 25 mg tablets, or matching placebo, were administered once daily. The duration of 
treatment was 12 weeks 
Objectives 
Primary objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of naloxegol 12.5 mg and 25 mg with 
placebo in the treatment of patients who have OIC. 
Secondary objectives 
The secondary objectives were to compare naloxegol 12.5 mg and 25 mg with placebo on the daily signs 
and symptoms associated with OIC (straining, sensation of incomplete evacuation, and stool 
consistency), symptoms of constipation, and quality of life. 
Safety objective 
The safety objectives were to assess the safety and tolerability of naloxegol when used for the treatment 
of OIC.

Exploratory objectives 
The exploratory objectives were to characterize the PK of naloxegol and the covariate effect in the 
targeted disease population, explore the naloxegol exposure-response relationship, collect and store 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for future exploratory research, assess patient health status index and 
healthcare resource utilization, and assess patients’ willingness to take the study drug again. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was response (responder/non-responder) to study drug during Weeks 1 to 
12. The endpoint incorporates both the durability of effect and a clinically relevant increase in the SBM 
rates across the 12-week treatment period.  
The key secondary efficacy endpoints were chosen to further characterize SBM improvement 
in OIC patients. The key secondary efficacy endpoints are:  
1.  Response to study drug in the LIR subgroup during Weeks 1 to 12 - to examine efficacy 
in this particular subgroup, which is characterized by continued moderate to very severe 
OIC symptoms, despite laxative use. 
2.  Time (in hours) to first post-dose laxation without the use of rescue laxatives within the 
previous 24 h - to examine speed of onset. This end point is relevant given that many 
patients may want to have prompt relief of symptoms and be able to predict the onset of 
action. 
3.  Mean number of days per week with at least 1 SBM (and less than 4 SBMs/day) during 
Weeks 1 to 12 - to examine regularity of SBMs, ie, the degree to which the SBMs occur on 
separate days, as opposed to multiple SBMs on a small number of days. 
The other secondary endpoints assessed to further characterize the efficacy of naloxegol are: 
1.  Response (responder/non-responder) to study drug during Weeks 1 to 4. 
2.  Response (responder/non-responder) to study drug in the LIR subgroup during Weeks 1 to 4. 
3.  Change from baseline in number of SBMs/week for Weeks 1 to 4 and 1 to 12. 
4.  Time (in hours) to first post-dose laxation without the use of rescue laxatives within the previous 
24 hours in the LIR subgroup. 
5.  Response within the first 12 hours of treatment. 
6.  Mean number of days per week with at least 1 SBM for Weeks 1 to 4. 
7.  Change from baseline in the mean degree of straining for Weeks 1 to 4 and 1 to 12. 
8.  Change from baseline in the mean stool consistency (BSS) for Weeks 1 to 4 and 1 to 12. 
9.  Percentage of days with CSBM for Weeks 1 to 4 and 1 to 12. 
10. Mean bisacodyl dose per week for Weeks 1 to 4 and 1 to 12. 
11. Change from baseline in PAC-SYM total score (to assess symptoms of constipation )and each 
domain score for Weeks 2, 4, 8, and 12. 
12. Change from baseline in PAC-QOL total score (to assess disease-specific quality of life) and each 
domain score for Weeks 4 and 12.

Safety endpoints 
1.  Adverse events (ie, incidence, nature, and intensity of AEs, treatment-related AEs, SAEs, AEs 
leading to discontinuation, and AEs of special interest). 
2.  Change from baseline in the mean daily opioid dose for Weeks 1 to 4 and 1 to 12. 
3.  Change from baseline in the mean NRS pain score for Weeks 1 to 4 and 1 to 12. 
4.  Observed values and change from baseline in composite score in modified Himmelsbach scale 
(mHS) for the evaluation of centrally mediated opioid withdrawal symptoms 2 hours after first 
dose of study drug, and at Weeks 1, 4, and 12. 
5.  Changes in vital signs, weight and BMI, and changes in physical examination. 
6.  Changes in laboratory assessments (ie, chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis). 
7.  Changes in ECGs. 
8.  Occurrence of suicidal behaviour/suicidal ideation throughout the study based on the C-SSRS.

Sample size 
A sample size of 105 patients per group would have been needed to detect a difference of 25% in 
response rate (60% on NKTR-118 and 35% on placebo), with power=90%, alpha=0.025, and 2-sided 
test. In order to provide an adequate power to detect a treatment difference in LIR subgroup (assuming 
LIR is 50% of the total study population), it was recommended that 210 patients per group (total 630 
patients for 3 treatment groups) be randomized to the study. The assumptions on expected response rate 
were referenced from the NKTR-118 Phase II study and from other similar drugs based on response over 
4 weeks. It was assumed that a similar magnitude in relative treatment effect would hold for the response 
assessed over 12 weeks. 
Randomisation 
Randomization occurred at the onset of the 12-week, double-blind treatment period at Visit 3. Patients 
were stratified based on their response to laxative use (LIR, LAR, LUR), and were randomly assigned in a 
1:1:1 ratio (approximately 210 patients per treatment group) to receive placebo, or naloxegol at a dose 
of 12.5 or 25 mg once daily (QD), with a minimum of 50% of patients randomized in the LIR category.

Blinding (masking) 
The study was conducted in a double-blind manner. Naloxegol 12.5 and 25 mg tablets were identical in 
size and colour to their respective placebo tablets. Packaging and labelling of the investigational products 
(IPs) were performed in a way to ensure blinding throughout the study. Patients received 2 tablets per 
dose, irrespective of which randomized dose they receive. 
No member of the study team or company representative, at investigational centres or any contract 
research organization (CRO) handling data had access to the randomization scheme during the conduct of 
the study with the exception of the company’s Research and Development Supply Chain. 
The randomization schedule for blinding of randomized treatment was maintained by the company and 
was not to be disclosed until after database lock. 
Statistical methods 
The efficacy analyses utilized the ITT Analysis Set, consisting of all patients randomized to study 
treatment for the duration of their participation in the confirmatory studies. A decision was made and 
documented prior to database lock, to exclude patients from the ITT analysis set who had previously or 
concurrently participated in the naloxegol program at another study centre.  All data were retained in the 
database and included in the patient data listings in the CSRs. 
Results were summarized using frequency and percentages for categorical data and n, mean, standard 
deviation, median, minimum, maximum for continuous data. Treatment comparisons were made 
between each active treatment group (NKTR-118 12.5 mg and 25 mg) vs placebo for all data analyzed. 
The primary endpoint, response over 12 weeks, was analyzed using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) 
tests stratified by response to laxatives at baseline (LIR, laxative adequate responder [LAR], laxative 
unknown responder [LUR]). The treatment effect was further characterized by the relative risk (RR, 
NKTR-118/placebo) with associated 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
To control the overall Type I error rate to be < 0.05 for the multiple pairwise comparisons versus placebo 
in the primary and the key secondary endpoints, an MTP with Bonferroni- Holm over dose groups, and 
fixed-sequence within groups (in the order below) was applied: 
- 12-week responder analysis in the ITT analysis set (primary endpoint, analyzed via the Cochran Mantel 
Haenszel test stratified by baseline laxative response), 
- Comparison of the response rate of Weeks 1 to 12 of NKTR-118 12.5 mg vs placebo and NKTR-118 25 
mg vs placebo in the LIR subgroup. Difference between treatment groups in response rate was analyzed 
using Chi-Square tests. The treatment effect was characterized by the RR (NKTR-118 group/placebo) 
with associated 2-sided 95% CIs. 
- Treatment comparisons of NKTR-118 12.5 mg vs placebo and NKTR-118 25 mg vs placebo, for the time 
to first laxation without laxative use in the previous 24 hours were analyzed using log rank tests stratified 
by response to laxatives at baseline (LIR, LAR, LUR). 
- Comparison of the mean number of days per week with at least 1 SBM during the 12 weeks of treatment 
of NKTR-118 12.5 mg vs placebo and NKTR-118 25 mg vs placebo (analyzed via Mixed Model Repeated 
Measures [MMRM]).  
All continuous efficacy endpoints were analyzed formally via a MMRM approach. MMRM models adjusted 
for fixed effects of treatment, baseline value, week, treatment-by-week interaction, baseline laxative 
responder status with center and patient incorporated via random effects.

Endpoints for daily symptoms, Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM), Patient 
Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life (PAC-QOL), morphine equivalent dose, and Numeric Rating 
Scale (NRS) pain score, were analyzed using a mixed model repeated measures approach in a similar 
manner to that described above.  
Results 
Participant flow 
Recruitment 
Recruitment started in July 2011 and ended in September 2012. Both male and female patients, between 
18 and 84 years of age, have been enrolled in the study in United States, Australia, Germany and 
Slovakia.  
Conduct of the study 
Of the 138 study centres selected for this study, 115 screened at least 1 patient and 98 randomized 
patients into the study. This study was conducted in the following countries: Australia (1 centre), 
Germany (5 centres), Slovakia (4 centres), and the United States (US) (88 centres). Time of clinical part: 
from 14 March 2011 (first subject enrolled), to 16 August 2012 ( last subject last visit). 
The original study protocol date was 01 December 2010. There were 2 global amendments (17 February 
2011 and 02 November 2011). The Company’s Clinical Study Team was responsible for all amendments 
and changes to the study conduct. All protocol amendments were approved by the company before being 
submitted to a regulatory authority and/or an EC/IRB. The implementation of the protocol amendments

did not have a significant effect on the composition of the study population or the interpretation of the 
study results. 
Baseline data 
Study 04 enrolled an OIC population representative of patients receiving long-term opioid treatment for 
non-cancer pain, with respect to demographic and baseline disease characteristics. 
In general, baseline demographic data were similar across treatment groups. Most patients randomized 
in this study were White (497 patients; 77.5%), and the mean age of patients was 52.3 years of age. The 
percentage of participating females was higher than males, and 331 (51.6%) patients had a BMI ≥30 
kg/m2. There were slightly more males included in the NKTR-118 25 mg group than in the NKTR-118 12.5 
mg or placebo treatment groups. Overall, the mean BMI was similar across treatment groups: 31.6, 32.1, 
and 31.3 kg/m2 in the NKTR-118 25 mg, 12.5 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. 
Patients were required to have an opioid-requiring pain condition and to be receiving a stable 
maintenance opioid regimen. 
The total opioid dose was calculated as the sum of the maintenance and breakthrough opioid use. At 
baseline there were no notable imbalances between treatment groups in mean daily morphine equivalent 
dose: means were 143.2 mg/day, 139.7 mg/day, 135.6 mg/day in the NKTR-118 25 mg, NKTR-118 12.5 
mg, and placebo groups, respectively. The most commonly used maintenance opioid medications were 
hydrocodone + paracetamol (176 patients; 27.5%), morphine (157 patients; 24.5%), and oxycodone 
(154 patients; 24.0%). On average, the distribution of maintenance opioid medications was similar 
across treatment groups. 
The most frequent main complaints with constipation were straining (146 patients; 22.8%), infrequent 
defecation (133 patients; 20.7%), hard stools (97 patients; 15.1%), and abdominal pain (91 patients; 
14.2%). More patients had experienced abdominal pain since the start of their current opioid treatment 
than had not: 380 patients (59.3%) compared with 258 patients (40.2%). Overall, for the majority of 
patients, the location of abdominal pain was in the right or left lower quadrant: 257 (40.1%) and 267 
(41.7%) patients, respectively; and was intermittent rather than constant: 327 (51.0%) compared with 
53 (8.3%) patients, respectively. 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 1750 patients were enrolled in the study and of these, 652 patients completed the OIC 
confirmation period, were randomized, and entered the double-blind treatment period. Of the randomized 
patients, 99.5% received treatment, 80.4% completed the study (defined as completing Visit 8 [Week 
12] for patients who continued into the safety extension study, or completing Visit 9 [Week 14] for 
patients who did not continue into the safety extension study), and 17.5% received treatment and 
subsequently discontinued the study. Of the 652 randomized patients, 297 (45.6%) who were included in 
the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set completed the study and continued into the double-blind safety 
extension study (D3820C00007). A total of 11 additional patients completed the study, but had 
previously or concurrently participated in the NKTR-118 program at another study centre and were 
excluded from the ITT and safety analysis sets. Of the 652 patients randomised, 17.5% discontinued the 
study: 18.8%, 17.1%, and 16.6% in the NKTR-118 25 mg, 12.5 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. 
The most common reasons for study withdrawal were adverse events (AEs) (6.4%) and subject decision 
(5.5%). The proportion of patients who discontinued treatment due to AEs was higher in the NKTR-118 25 
mg treatment group (10.1%) than in the 12.5 mg (4.1%) or placebo (5.1%) treatment groups. Overall, 
there were no imbalances across the treatment groups in terms of patient characteristics that could have 
a potential influence on the results and their interpretation. Treatment groups were generally balanced

across analysis sets with respect to: disposition; protocol deviations; demographic and baseline 
characteristics; prior and concomitant medications, including the pattern of laxative classes taken prior to 
study entry, satisfaction with laxative classes, and the pattern of related severity of symptoms; and 
treatment compliance. Most patients were taking laxatives prior to enrolment into the study. The US was 
the predominant region accounting for most randomized patients. The patient population recruited to the 
study was considered representative of OIC patients globally with respect to demographic and disease 
characteristics at baseline. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The primary efficacy variable is the response (responder/non-responder) to study drug during Weeks 1 to 
12. A SBM was defined as a BM without the use of rescue laxatives (bisacodyl or enema) administered in 
the previous 24 hours. A responder to study drug during Weeks 1 to 12 was defined as a patient with at 
least 3 SBMs/week and at least a 1 SBM/week increase over baseline for at least 9 out of the 12 treatment 
weeks and 3 out of the last 4 treatment weeks during the double-blind treatment period demonstrated by 
the primary analysis in the ITT analysis set.

Statistically significant higher response rates were observed in the NKTR-118 25 mg and 12.5 mg 
treatment groups compared with placebo over 12 weeks in patients with OIC (p=0.001 and 0.015, 
respectively). The response rate at Week 12 was 15.0 percentage points and 11.4 percentage points 
higher, respectively, in the NKTR-118 25 mg and 12.5 mg groups, compared with placebo. 
The following results were obtained for the key secondary endpoints: 
In the LIR subgroup, there was a statistically significantly higher response rate in the NKTR-118 25 mg 
(p=0.002) and 12.5 mg (p=0.028) groups compared with placebo over 12 weeks in patients with OIC. 
The response rate at Week 12 was 19.9 percentage points and 13.8 percentage points higher, 
respectively, in the NKTR-118 25 mg and 12.5 mg groups, compared with placebo. The RR estimates 
indicated that LIR subgroup patients in the NKTR-118 25 mg and 12.5 mg groups were 69.1% and 
47.9%, respectively, more likely to respond than those randomized to placebo.

pooled population (study 4 and study 5, see additional analyses). The forest plot for 12 week response 
(study 04 population) is presented below: 
The time to first post-dose laxation was statistically significantly shorter for both the NKTR-118 25 mg and 
12.5 mg treatment groups compared with placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). The NKTR-118 25 mg 
and 12.5 mg groups had shorter median time to first post-dose laxation compared with placebo (5.9, 
20.4, and 35.8 hours, respectively). This was reflected by the proportions of patients who had a SBM by 
6 hours (50.9%, 33.8%, and 15.4%, respectively), 12 hours (57.0%, 43.7%, and 22.9%, respectively),

Degree of straining 
At baseline, the 3 groups were comparable in mean degree of straining (3.2, 3.1, 3.3 in the 25 mg, 12.5 
mg, and placebo groups, respectively). The mean straining scores across the treatment groups at 
baseline indicated a moderate level of straining. Over Weeks 1 to 12, there was a decrease in straining 
observed in all treatment groups, with larger decreases in the MMRM-estimated Least-Squares Mean 
changes from baseline (standard error of the mean [SEM]) of greater than 0.5 points seen with increasing 
doses of NKTR-118 (-0.73 [0.05], -0.64 [0.05], and -0.54 [0.05] for the 25 mg, 12.5 mg, and placebo 
groups, respectively). The 25 mg group showed an improvement in intensity of straining compared with 
placebo of -0.18 (p=0.008), while the 12.5 mg group showed a similar improvement in intensity of 
straining as that observed with placebo (non-significant difference) (p=0.176).  
Stool Consistency (BSS ratings) 
At baseline, the 3 groups were comparable in mean stool consistency assessed by BSS ratings (2.9, 2.9, 
2.8 in the 25 mg, 12.5 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. The mean BSS scores across the treatment 
groups indicated relatively low symptom burden from stool hardness at baseline. BSS types 3 and 4 are 
considered to reflect "ideal stools." Over Weeks 1 to 12, the MMRM-estimated Least-Squares Means 
(SEM) indicated an increase in stool consistency in all treatment groups, with greater increases seen with 
increased doses of NKTR-118: 0.66 (0.07), 0.53 (0.07), and 0.47 (0.07) for the 25 mg, 12.5 mg, and 
placebo groups, respectively. The 25 mg group showed an improvement in BSS ratings compared with 
placebo of 0.18 (p=0.042), while the 12.5 mg group showed a similar improvement in BSS ratings as that 
observed with placebo (non-significant difference) (p=0.564).  
Completeness of evacuation (percent number of days with a CSBM) 
At baseline, the 3 groups were comparable in completeness of evacuation assessed by percent number of 
days per week with a CSBM (5.4, 6.5, 6.0 in the 25 mg, 12.5 mg, and placebo groups, respectively). Over 
Weeks 1 to 12, the MMRM-estimated Least-Squares Means (SEM) were 27.04 (1.75), 22.31 (1.73), and 
18.45 (1.72) for the 25 mg, 12.5 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. The 25 mg group showed an 
increase in percent number of days with a CSBM/week compared with placebo of 8.59 (p<0.001). The 
12.5 mg group showed a smaller increase in percent number of days with a CSBM/week compared with 
placebo of 3.87 (p=0.094). 
Change from baseline in mean spontaneous bowel movements/week 
There was an increase in mean SBMs per week in the NKTR-118 25 mg and 12.5 mg groups compared 
with placebo (0.99; p<0.001, and 0.54; p=0.011, respectively). These numbers correspond to 
approximately 4.4 SBMs per week in the NKTR-118 25 mg group compared with 3.9 and 3.4 SBMs per 
week in the NKTR-118 12.5 mg and placebo groups, respectively.

Time (in hours) to first post-dose laxation without the use of rescue laxatives within the 
previous 24 hours in the LIR subgroup 
In the LIR subgroup, the NKTR-118 25 mg and 12.5 mg groups had shorter median time to first post-dose 
laxation compared with placebo (5.4, 20.6, 43.4 hours, respectively)  
The time to first post-dose laxation was significantly shorter for both the NKTR-118 25 mg and NKTR-118 
12.5 mg groups compared with placebo (p<0.001 and p=0.002, respectively). 
Predictability of response to study drug based on the first 12 hours 
For the single analysis conducted to assess short- and long-term response relationship, there was no clear 
relationship between response in the first 12 hours and response over 12 weeks for the NKTR-118 25 mg 
group (p=0.430). In the NKTR-118 12.5 mg and placebo groups, patients who had a SBM within the first 
12 hours were more likely to be considered responders over 12 weeks compared with patients who did not 
have an SBM within 12 hours (p<0.001 and p=0.007, respectively). 
Rescue medication use 
Over the 12-week study period, the mean weekly bisacodyl dose was low: 5.8 mg, 5.9 mg, and 10.3 mg 
in the NKTR-118 25 mg, 12.5 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. Over the 12-week study period, the 
median number of times that patients used bisacodyl as a rescue laxative was 1.0 for the NKTR-118 25 
mg group, 2.0 for the NKTR-118 12.5 group, and 4.0 for placebo. The proportion of patients who used 
bisacodyl at least once was lower in the NKTR-118 25 mg (117 patients; 54.7%) and 12.5 mg (135 
patients; 63.4%) groups compared with the placebo group (154 patients; 72.0%). No formal statistical 
analysis was conducted for this measure. Bisacodyl rescue medication usage during the first 4 weeks was 
similar to bisacodyl rescue medication usage over the 12-week period. The number and percentage of 
patients that used an enema 1 time or more than once during the study was low in the ITT analysis set 
and similar across treatment groups.  
PAC-SYM assessment 
A negative change from baseline using PAC-SYM indicates improvement. Scoring on the PAC-SYM ranged 
from 0 (absence of symptoms) to 4 (very severe) for each item. At baseline, the treatment groups were 
similar in PAC-SYM total score and abdominal, rectal, and stool domain scores. The mean baseline domain 
scores across all 3 treatment groups indicates that patients in the study were most affected by symptoms 
in the stool domain (moderate to severe) and affected to a lesser extent by symptoms in the abdominal 
and rectal domains (mild to moderate). Changes from baseline in the severity of constipation symptoms, 
as measured by PAC-SYM total score, rectal symptoms subscore and stool symptoms subscore at Week 
12, were numerically greater for the NKTR-118 12.5 mg and 25 mg groups compared with placebo, 
however there are no statistically significant differences between analyzed groups (beside rectal 
symptoms subscore).  
Change from baseline in PAC-QOL 
A negative change from baseline using PAC-QOL indicates improvement. Changes from baseline in the 
satisfaction domain were of particular interest in this study and pre-defined for statistical analysis.  
Compliance with the PAC-QOL was similar across treatment groups over study visits, ranging from 91% 
to 99% at individual visits.  
At baseline, the treatment groups were similar in PAC-QOL total score and satisfaction, physical 
discomfort, psychosocial discomfort, and worries and concerns domain scores. All 3 treatment groups had 
negative changes from baseline to each visit in PAC-QOL total and all domain scores, indicating 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/738815/2014  
Page 64/120 
 
 
 
 
 
improvement in quality of life for all patients. Changes from baseline in total score, physical discomfort, 
psychosocial discomfort, and worries and concerns domains for the NKTR-118 25 mg and 12.5 mg were 
comparable with placebo, and were not formally analyzed. The only significant effect was observed in 
NKTR-118 25 mg group in comparison to placebo group at Week 4 (p=0.002) in satisfaction domain but 
that effect disappeared at Week 12.

Notes 
The effect sizes for the PE endpoint and first key secondary endpoint response 
rate were not reported as RR with 95% CI. The 25% effect size in response 
rate (treatment versus placebo) based on the response over 4 weeks from the 
Phase 2b study, for which the phase 3 study was designed, was not 
demonstrated by the primary endpoint nor the first key secondary endpoint 
based on response over 12 weeks. 
STUDY 05 (Study code D3820C00005) 
This was a Phase III, multi-centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel group study of 
2 doses of NKTR-118 (25 mg and 12.5 mg) and placebo. The study duration was up to 18 weeks, 
consisting of an initial screening period lasting up to 2 weeks, a 2-week OIC confirmation period, during 
which the diagnosis of OIC and stability of the opioid regimen were confirmed, a 12-week treatment 
period, and a follow-up visit 2 weeks after the last dose of study drug. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Adult patients who were receiving a stable maintenance opioid regimen (total daily dose of 30 to 1000 mg 
of oral morphine, or equianalgesic amount[s] of 1 or more other opioid therapies for a minimum of 4 
weeks) for non-cancer-related pain and who reported a history of <3 spontaneous bowel movements 
(SBMs)/week and at least 1 OIC associated symptom at screening and had a confirmed diagnosis of OIC 
were eligible to be randomized.  
Confirmed OIC was defined as: documented <3 SBMs/week on average over the 2-week OIC 
confirmation period. In addition to the SBM frequency criterion, patients must have reported ≥1 of the 
following symptoms in at least 25% of the bowel movements (BMs) recorded in the electronic diary during 
the OIC confirmation period Bristol Stool Scale stool type 1 or 2; moderate, severe, or very severe 
straining; incomplete BM.  
In addition, a minimum of 50% of patients were to meet the following criteria for being laxative 
inadequate responders (LIR): Patient must have been taking 1 laxative class for a minimum of 4 days 
over the 14 days prior to the screening visit and report moderate, severe, or very severe symptoms in at 
least 1 of the 4 stool symptom domains to qualify for assessment of LIR.  
Main inclusion criteria 
The studies enrolled adult patients who were between the ages of ≥18 and <85 years: 
  whose OIC diagnosis had been confirmed prospectively with a 2 week daily diary; 
  who were receiving a stable maintenance opioid regimen for a minimum of 4 weeks for 
non-cancer-related pain; 
 
and who reported a history of <3 SBMs/week and at least 1 OIC-associated symptom at screening 
and had a confirmed diagnosis of OIC. 
Main exclusion criteria 
Patients presenting any of the following conditions were not included in the trial:

patients with pre-existing constipation for reasons other than opioid treatment, or patients who 
had diarrhea; 
patients with potentially weakened integrity of the GI wall, due to risk for bowel perforation; 
patients who required concomitant prohibited medication (ie, strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 or P-gp, 
opioid antagonists and mixed agonists/antagonists, and laxatives); 
patients with potential for blood-brain barrier disruptions (eg, active multiple sclerosis, recent 
brain injury, advanced Alzheimer’s disease, uncontrolled epilepsy); 
patients with cancer pain; 
and patients with recent history of myocardial infarction (MI), symptomatic congestive heart 
failure, or any other overt CV disease. 
Treatments 
NKTR-118 12.5 mg or 25 mg tablets, or matching placebo, administered once daily. The duration of 
treatment was 12 weeks. Study drug tablets were round, biconvex, and white film coated. Tablets were 
supplied in high-density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles, dispensed every 30 days. Each 30-day supply 
consisted of 2 bottles of study drug, each containing 35 tablets. 
Objectives 
Primary objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to compare the efficacy of NKTR-118 12.5 mg and 25 mg with 
placebo in the treatment of patients who have OIC. 
Secondary objectives 
The secondary objectives were to compare NKTR-118 12.5 mg and 25 mg with placebo on the daily signs 
and symptoms associated with OIC (straining, sensation of incomplete evacuation, and stool 
consistency), symptoms of constipation, and quality of life. 
Safety objective 
The safety objectives were to assess the safety and tolerability of NKTR-118 when used for the treatment 
of OIC. 
Exploratory objectives 
The exploratory objectives were to characterize the PK of NKTR-118 and the covariate effect in the 
targeted disease population, explore the NKTR-118 exposure-response relationship, collect and store 
deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) for future exploratory research, assess patient health status index and 
healthcare resource utilization, and assess patients’ willingness to take the study drug again.

Sample size 
A sample size of 105 patients per group would have been needed to detect a difference of 25% in 
response rate (60% on NKTR-118 and 35% on placebo), with power=90%, alpha=0.025, and 2-sided 
test. In order to provide an adequate power to detect a treatment difference in LIR subgroup (assuming 
LIR is 50% of the total study population), it was recommended that 210 patients per group (total 630 
patients for 3 treatment groups) be randomized to the study. The assumptions on expected response rate 
were referenced from the NKTR-118 Phase II study and from other similar drugs based on response over 
4 weeks. It was assumed that a similar magnitude in relative treatment effect would hold for the response 
assessed over 12 weeks.  
Randomisation 
Randomization occurred at the onset of the 12-week, double-blind treatment period at Visit 3. Patients 
were stratified based on their response to laxative use (LIR, LAR, LUR), and were randomly assigned in a 
1:1:1 ratio (approximately 210 patients per treatment group) to receive placebo, or NKTR-118 at a dose 
of 12.5 or 25 mg once daily (QD), with a minimum of 50% of patients randomized in the LIR category.  
Eligible patients will be randomized in balanced blocks to receive NKTR-118 12.5 mg, NKTR-118 25 mg, 
or matching placebo in a 1:1:1 ratio. The actual treatment given to individual patients will be determined 
by a randomization scheme that has been loaded into the IVRS database. The randomization scheme will 
be produced by a computer software program called GRand (Global Randomization system) that 
incorporates a standard procedure for generating random numbers. If a patient is discontinued from the 
study, his/her patient number or enrolment number will not be reused, and the patient will not be allowed 
to re-enter the study. Randomized patients who discontinue early from the study will not be replaced. 
Randomization codes will be assigned strictly sequentially within the response to laxative categories as 
patients become eligible for randomization.  
If a randomization number is allocated incorrectly, no attempt should be made to remedy the error once 
the investigational product has been dispensed. The patient will continue with the allocated number and 
IP. AstraZeneca or its representative should be notified as soon as the error is discovered. Subsequent 
patients will continue using the first unallocated randomization number in the original numbering

sequence. Entry of incorrect stratification information into the IVRS will not disqualify a patient from 
continuation in the study.  
Blinding (masking) 
NKTR-118 12.5 and 25 mg tablets will be identical in size and colour to their respective placebo tablets. 
Packaging and labeling of the investigational products will be performed in a way to ensure blinding 
throughout the study. Patients will receive 2 tablets per dose, irrespective of which randomized dose they 
receive. 
No member of the company’s study team or its representative, at investigational centers or any contract 
research organization handling data will have access to the randomization scheme during the conduct of 
the study with the exception of company’s Research and Development Supply Chain. The randomization 
schedule for blinding of randomized treatment will be maintained by the company and will not be 
disclosed until after database lock. 
Statistical methods 
The primary endpoint, response over 12 weeks, was analyzed using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) 
tests stratified by response to laxatives at baseline (LIR, laxative adequate responder [LAR], laxative 
unknown responder [LUR]). The treatment effect was further characterized by the relative risk (RR, 
NKTR-118/placebo) with associated 2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs).  
The following were categorized as key secondary endpoints and analyzed as indicated:  
1.  Comparison of the response rate of Weeks 1 to 12 of NKTR-118 12.5 mg vs. placebo and 
NKTR-118 25 mg vs. placebo in the LIR subgroup. Difference between treatment groups 
in response rate was analyzed using Chi-Square tests. The treatment effect was 
characterized by the RR (NKTR-118 group/placebo) with associated 2-sided 95% CIs. 
2.  Treatment comparisons of NKTR-118 12.5 mg vs. placebo and NKTR-118 25 mg vs 
placebo, for the time to first laxation without laxative use in the previous 24 hours were 
analyzed using log rank tests stratified by response to laxatives at baseline (LIR, LAR, 
LUR). 
3.  Comparison of the mean number of days per week with at least 1 SBM during the 12 
weeks of treatment of NKTR-118 12.5 mg vs placebo and NKTR-118 25 mg vs placebo. 
Differences between treatment groups were analyzed using a mixed model for repeated 
measures. The model included factors for treatment, baseline laxative response status, 
time (Weeks 1 through 12 as a categorical variable), mean baseline value and 
treatment-by-time interaction as fixed effects, and center as a random effect. Descriptive 
statistics for the mean number of days per week with at least 1 SBM over Weeks 1 to 12 
were also presented by treatment group. To control the overall type I error rate to be ≤ 
0.05 for the multiple comparisons in the primary and the key secondary endpoints, a 
Multiple Testing Procedure with Bonferroni-Holm over groups, and fixed-sequence within 
groups was applied, with the endpoints tested in the order indicated above.  
Endpoints for daily symptoms, Patient Assessment of Constipation Symptoms (PAC-SYM), Patient 
Assessment of Constipation Quality of Life (PAC-QOL), morphine equivalent dose, and Numeric Rating 
Scale (NRS) pain score, were analyzed using a mixed model repeated measures approach in a similar 
manner to that described above.

Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 1969 patients entered screening. 
A total of 700 patients completed the OIC confirmation period, were randomized, and entered the 
double-blind treatment period. Of these patients, 697 (99.6%) received treatment, and 537 (76.7%) 
completed the study (defined as completing Visit 8 [Week 12] for patients who continued into the 
long-term safety study, or completing Visit 9 [Week 14] for patients who did not continue into the 
long-term safety study). Patients who did not enter the long-term safety study were to participate in a 
follow-up visit 2 weeks after the last dose of study drug. 
Overall, 78 patients from the ITT analysis set (11.1% of the total randomized) completed the study and 
continued into long-term safety study D3820C00008. 
A total of 4 additional patients (2 patients in the NKTR-118 25 mg group and 1 patient each in the 
NKTR-118 12.5 mg and placebo groups) received treatment, but had previously or concurrently 
participated in the NKTR-118 program at another study center. Three of these patients (0.4%; 1 patient 
in each treatment group) completed the study. These 4 patients were identified prior to database lock and 
were not included in the ITT or Safety analysis sets (see Section 2.2 of the SAP in CSR Appendix 12.1.9). 
The remaining text in this section describes the patients in the ITT analysis set; however, percentages are 
based on the total number of patients randomized. 
A total of 156 patients (22.3%) who received treatment discontinued the study. The most common 
reason for discontinuation from the study was subject decision (56 patients; 8.0% overall). The number 
and percentage of patients who were withdrawn due to subject decision was 20 (8.5%) in the NKTR-118 
25 mg group, 23 (9.9 %) in the NKTR-118 12.5 mg group, and 13 (5.6%) in the placebo group. The 
second most common reason for discontinuation was AEs (47 patients; 6.7% overall). A greater

proportion of patients were withdrawn due to Aes in the NKTR-118 25 mg group (24 patients; 10.3%) 
compared with the NKTR-118 12.5 mg group (11 patients; 4.7%) and the placebo group (12 patients, 
5.2%). 
Information on patients who withdrew from the study was provided on the Withdrawal CRF pages, 
however information for discontinuation of IP due to AEs (DAEs) was derived from the “action taken 
regarding study drug” field of the AE CRF pages, resulting in discrepancies between these 2 CRF pages for 
1 patient. 
A total of 696 patients were randomized and included in the ITT analysis set at 117 centers in Belgium (7 
patients; 1.0%), Croatia (8 patients; 1.1%), Czech Republic (10 patients; 1.4%), Hungary (14 patients; 
2.0%), Spain (15 patients; 2.2%), Sweden (2 patients; 0.3%), United Kingdom (4 patients; 0.6%), and 
the US (636 patients; 91.4%). 
Recruitment 
Recruitment started in March 2011 and ended in September 2012. Both male and female patients, 
between 18 and 84 years of age, have been enrolled in the study in United States, Belgium, Croatia, 
Czech Republic, Hungary, Spain, Sweden and United Kingdom. 
Conduct of the study 
In Study 05, following incorrect allocation of the subject number to the eDiary device, diary data from 1 
LUR patient (E5214029) randomized to the NKTR-118 25 mg treatment group was assessed to be 
non-retrievable when the database was locked initially. The patient was initially classified as a 
non-responder. The exclusion of this retrievable data was considered, following the company’s standard 
operating procedures, to be a critical data error and as such the database was unlocked in order that the 
diary data from this patient could be included in the final analysis. 
The final analysis was completed after the diary data for this patient was added to the database, and the 
database was re-locked. For the primary variable, the relative risk and corresponding p-value for the 
NKTR-118 25 mg group vs placebo were 1.33 and 0.026, respectively, following the initial database lock 
and 1.35 and 0.021, respectively, after the final database lock. 
Baseline data 
Overall, there were no notable imbalances across the treatment groups in terms of patient characteristics 
that could have a potential influence on the results and their interpretation. Treatment groups were 
generally balanced across analysis sets with respect to: disposition; protocol deviations; demographic 
and baseline characteristics; prior and concomitant medications, including the pattern of laxative classes 
taken prior to study entry, satisfaction with laxative classes, and the pattern of related severity of 
symptoms; and treatment compliance. Most patients were taking laxatives prior to enrolment into the 
study. The US was the predominant region accounting for most randomized patients. The patient 
population recruited to the study was considered representative of OIC patients globally with respect to 
demographic and disease characteristics at baseline. 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 1969 patients were enrolled in the study and of these, 700 patients completed the OIC 
confirmation period, were randomized, and entered the double-blind treatment period. Of the randomized

patients, 99.6% received treatment, 76.7% completed the study (defined as completing Visit 8 [Week 
12] for patients who continued into the long-term safety study, or completing Visit 9 [Week 14] for 
patients who did not continue into the long-term safety study), and 22.3% received treatment and 
subsequently discontinued the study. Of the 700 randomized patients, 78 (11.1%) who were included in 
the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis set completed the study and continued into the long-term safety study 
(D3820C00008).  
A total of 3 additional patients completed the study, but had previously or concurrently participated in the 
NKTR-118 program at another study center and were excluded from the ITT and safety analysis sets.  
Of the 700 patients randomised, 22.3% discontinued the study: 25.2%, 22.7%, and 18.9% in the 
NKTR-118 12.5 mg, 25 mg, and placebo groups, respectively.  
The most common reasons for study withdrawal were subject decision (8.0%) and adverse events (AEs, 
6.7%). A greater proportion of patients discontinued treatment due to AEs in the NKTR-118 25 mg group 
(10.3%) compared with the NKTR-118 12.5 mg group (4.7%) and the placebo group (5.2%).  
Overall, there were no notable imbalances across the treatment groups in terms of patient characteristics 
that could have a potential influence on the results and their interpretation. Treatment groups were 
generally balanced across analysis sets with respect to: disposition; protocol deviations; demographic 
and baseline characteristics; prior and concomitant medications, including the pattern of laxative classes 
taken prior to study entry, satisfaction with laxative classes, and the pattern of related severity of 
symptoms; and treatment compliance. Most patients were taking laxatives prior to enrollment into the 
study. The US was the predominant region accounting for most randomized patients. The patient 
population recruited to the study was considered representative of OIC patients globally with respect to 
demographic and disease characteristics at baseline. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary variable: response (responder/non-responder) to study drug during Weeks 1 to 12 
The primary efficacy variable is the response (responder/non-responder) to study drug 
during Weeks 1 to 12. 
A SBM was defined as a BM without the use of rescue laxatives (bisacodyl or enema) administered in the 
previous 24 hours. A responder to study drug during Weeks 1 to 12 was defined as a patient with at least 
3 SBMs/week and at least a 1 SBM/week increase over baseline for at least 9 out of the 12 treatment 
weeks and 3 out of the last 4 treatment weeks during the double-blind treatment period demonstrated by 
the primary analysis in the ITT analysis set. For the primary efficacy variable, there was a statistically 
significantly higher response rate in the NKTR-118 25 mg group (p=0.021) compared with placebo over 
12 weeks in patients with OIC. There was no statistically significant difference between the 12.5 mg group 
and placebo (p=0.202). The response rate over 12 weeks was 10.4 percentage points and 5.6 percentage 
points higher, respectively, in the NKTR-118 25 mg and 12.5 mg groups, compared with placebo.  
The RR estimates indicated that patients randomized to the NKTR-118 25 mg group were 34.8% more 
likely to respond than those randomized to placebo. The definition of the primary endpoint ensured that 
for a patient to be considered a responder, improvement in SBMs had to be durable over the 12-week 
treatment period.

Key secondary variables 
Under the multiple testing procedure since the primary endpoint null hypothesis could not be rejected for 
the 12.5 mg dose versus placebo, statistical significance cannot be claimed for any key secondary 
endpoint in this dose group, although nominal unadjusted p-values are presented below.  
In the LIR subgroup, there was a statistically significantly higher response rate in the NKTR-118 25 mg 
group (p=0.014) compared with placebo over 12 weeks in patients with OIC. There was no statistically 
significant difference between the 12.5 mg group and placebo (p=0.074). The response rate over 12 
weeks was 15.4 percentage points and 11 percentage points higher, respectively, in the NKTR-118 25 mg 
and 12.5 mg groups, compared with placebo. The RR estimates indicated that LIR subgroup patients in 
the NKTR-118 25 mg and 12.5 mg groups were 48.9% and 35.0%, respectively, more likely to respond 
than those randomized to placebo. 
It is important to note that in the non-LIR subgroup the effect of both doses of NKTR-118 (although formal 
statistical analysis was not performed) was not significant. The statistical analysis was made for the 
pooled population (study 4 and study 5, see additional analyses). The forest plot for 12 week response 
(study 05 population) is presented below: 
The time to first post-dose laxation was significantly shorter for both the NKTR-118 25 mg and NKTR-118 
12.5 mg groups compared with placebo (p<0.001 for both comparisons). The Kaplan-Meier curves for 
time to first post-dose SBM were similar for both the NKTR-118 12.5 mg and NKTR-118 25 mg groups. 
Under the multiple testing procedure, however, in the absence of a statistically significant difference for 
the 12.5 mg group compared with placebo on the primary endpoint, statistical significance cannot be 
claimed for this comparison.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/738815/2014  
Page 75/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The NKTR-118 25 mg and 12.5 mg groups had a shorter median time to first post-dose laxation compared 
with placebo (12.0, 19.3, 37.2 hours respectively). This was reflected by the proportions of patients who 
had a SBM by 6 hours (39.2%, 34.5%, and 17.2%, respectively), 12 hours (49.6%, 44.0%, and 24.6%, 
respectively), or 24 hours (61.2%, 58.6%, and 36.6%, respectively) in the 3 groups.  
Mean number of days per week with at least 1 SBM during Weeks 1 to 12  
Over Weeks 1 to 12, there was a statistically significant increase in mean number of days/week with at 
least 1 SBM compared to placebo in the NKTR-118 25 mg group (0.68; p<0.001). Over Weeks 1 to 12, 
there was an increase in mean number of days/week with at least 1 SBM in the NKTR-118 12.5 mg group 
compared to placebo (0.39; p=0.010), however this increase was not considered to be statistically 
significant when the multiple testing procedure was applied. 
Other secondary variables 
Degree of straining 
At baseline, the 3 groups were comparable in mean degree of straining (3.2, 3.1, 3.3 in the 25 mg, 12.5 
mg, and placebo groups, respectively). The mean straining scores across the treatment groups at 
baseline indicated a moderate level of straining. Over Weeks 1 to 12, there was a decrease in straining 
observed in all treatment groups, with larger decreases in the MMRM-estimated Least-Squares Mean 
changes from baseline (standard error of the mean [SEM]) of greater than 0.5 points seen with increasing 
doses of NKTR-118 (-0.80 [0.06], -0.67 [0.06], and -0.48 [0.06] for the 25 mg, 12.5 mg, and placebo 
groups, respectively). The 25 mg group showed an improvement in intensity of straining compared with 
placebo of -0.32 (p<0.001), while the 12.5 mg group showed an improvement in intensity of straining 
compared with placebo of -0.19 (p=0.005).  
Stool Consistency (BSS ratings) 
At baseline, the 3 groups were comparable in mean stool consistency assessed by BSS ratings (2.8, 3.0, 
3.0 in the 25 mg, 12.5 mg, and placebo groups, respectively). Over Weeks 1 to 12, the MMRM-estimated 
Least-Squares Means (SEM) indicated an increase in stool consistency in all treatment groups, with 
greater increases seen with increased doses of NKTR-118: 0.71 (0.07), 0.54 (0.07), and 0.26 (0.06) for 
the 25 mg, 12.5 mg, and placebo groups, respectively. The 25 mg group showed an improvement in BSS 
ratings compared with placebo of 0.45 (p<0.001), while the 12.5 mg group showed an improvement in 
BSS ratings compared with placebo of 0.28 (p=0.001). 
Completeness of evacuation (percent number of days with a CSBM) 
At baseline, the 3 groups were comparable in completeness of evacuation assessed by percent number of 
days per week with a CSBM (5.4, 7.0, 6.0 in the 25 mg, 12.5 mg, and placebo groups, respectively). Over 
Weeks 1 to 12, the MMRM-estimated Least-Squares Means (SEM) were 27.20 (1.93), 23.48 (1.88), and 
16.76 (1.86) for the 25 mg, 12.5 mg, and placebo groups, respectively.  
The 25 mg group showed an increase in percent number of days with a CSBM/week compared with 
placebo of 10.43 (p<0.001). The 12.5 mg group showed an increase in percent number of days with a 
CSBM/week compared with placebo of 6.72 (p=0.002).  
Analysis of the change from baseline in number of days per week with CSBM showed an increase in days 
with a CSBM of 1.90 days and 1.64 days for the 25 mg and 12.5 mg NKTR-118 groups, compared to 1.17 
days for placebo (an improvement of 0.73 days and 0.47 days for the 25 mg and 12.5 mg groups versus 
placebo respectively). Results of the statistical analysis of days per week with at least 1 CSBM are 
equivalent to the statistical analysis of percent days per week with at least 1 CSBM.

Change from baseline in mean spontaneous bowel movements/week 
There was an increase in mean SBMs per week in the NKTR-118 25 mg and 12.5 mg groups compared 
with placebo (1.04; p<0.001 and 0.52; p=0.028, respectively), and this increase was maintained over 
the entire 12-week treatment period. These numbers correspond to approximately 4.6 SBMs per week in 
the NKTR-118 25 mg group compared with 4.1 and 3.6 SBMs per week in the NKTR-118 12.5 mg and 
placebo groups, respectively.  
Rescue medication use 
Over the 12-week study period, the mean weekly bisacodyl dose was low: 6.6 mg, 6.1 mg, and 7.9 mg in 
the NKTR-118 25 mg, 12.5 mg and placebo groups, respectively. Over the 12-week study period, the 
median number of times that patients used bisacodyl as a rescue laxative was 1.0 for the NKTR-118 25 
mg group, 1.0 for the NKTR-118 12.5 group, and 3.0 for placebo.  
The proportion of patients who used bisacodyl at least once was lower in the NKTR-118 25 mg (133 
patients; 57.3%) and 12.5 mg (133 patients; 57.3%) groups compared with the placebo group (164 
patients; 70.7%). No formal statistical analysis was conducted for this measure. The number and 
percentage of patients that used an enema 1 time or more than once during the study was low in the ITT 
analysis set and similar across treatment groups.  
Change from baseline in PAC-SYM 
At baseline, the treatment groups were similar in PAC-SYM total score and abdominal, rectal, and stool 
domain scores. The mean baseline domain scores across all 3 treatment groups indicates that patients in 
the study were most affected by symptoms in the stool domain (moderate to severe) and affected to a 
lesser extent by symptoms in the abdominal and rectal domains (mild to moderate).  
In all treatment groups, improvements compared to baseline were observed for each subscale. 
Differences between treatment groups in the PAC-SYM total score were primarily driven by differences in 
the rectal and stool subscales, with the abdominal symptoms sub-score comparable between treatment 
groups at all time points. For both the rectal and stool domains, improvements in scores compared with 
placebo were numerically greater for the NKTR-118 25 mg group compared with the 12.5 mg group, with 
the largest differences seen in the stool symptoms domain (-0.38, p<0.001 and -0.27, p=0.002) at 12 
weeks.  
Change from baseline in PAC-QOL  
At baseline, the treatment groups were similar in PAC-QOL total score and satisfaction, physical 
discomfort, psychosocial discomfort, and worries and concerns domain scores. All 3 treatment groups had 
negative changes from baseline to each visit in PAC-QOL total and all domain scores, indicating 
improvement in quality of life for all patients.  
The absolute value of changes from baseline in patient satisfaction as measured by the Satisfaction 
Domain of the PAC-QOL questionnaire were numerically greater for the NKTR-118 25 mg and 12.5 mg 
groups compared with the placebo group, in OIC patients in this study. Numerically greater differences 
were noted between the NKTR-118 25 mg group and the placebo group, and the NKTR-118 12.5 mg 
group and the placebo group, at both Week 4 (p<0.001 and p=0.015, respectively) and Week 12 
(p<0.001 and p=0.011, respectively).  
Changes from baseline in total score, physical discomfort, psychosocial discomfort, and worries and 
concerns domains for the NKTR-118 25 mg and 12.5 mg were comparable with placebo, and were not 
formally analyzed.

Notes 
The effect sizes for the PE endpoint and first key secondary endpoint response 
rate were not reported as such but as RR. The 25% effect size in response rate 
(treatment versus placebo) based on the response over 4 weeks from the 
Phase 2b study, for which the phase 2 study was designed, was not reached by 
any of these endpoints based on response over 12 weeks.  
The 25 mg naloxegol treatment effect, primary endpoint, is borderline 
statistically significant  
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Comparison of results in sub-populations 
To explore the uniformity of the treatment effect of naloxegol across patient subgroups, additional 
analyses were conducted on the primary outcome variable on pooled data from Studies 04 and 05. The 
purpose of these analyses was to explore whether or not the treatment effect is comparable across 
clinically relevant OIC subgroups and to exclude the possibility that the overall treatment effect was 
confounded by larger than expected treatment effect in one subgroup. With the exception of the LIR 
subgroup, the exploratory analyses were not designed or powered to detect differences between the 
treatment groups, and no adjustments for multiple comparisons were made. 
The following subgroups were selected for analysis: age (<50, 50-64, ≥65 years of age), gender, race 
(caucasian, black, and other), region (US and Europe), laxative response (LIR, non-LIR, and 2xLIR), BMI 
(<30 kg/mg2 and ≥30 kg/mg2), use of strong anticholinergics, maintenance opioid type (“weak” and 
“strong opioids”), and opioid dose (<200 meu/day and ≥200 meu/day). 
A comparison versus placebo of the response to study drug in the pooled subgroups from Studies 04 and 
05 for the naloxegol 12.5 mg group and the naloxegol 25 mg group are presented in Figure 1 and Figure 
2, respectively.

Figure 2 Response (naloxegol 25 mg vs placebo) to study drug during Weeks 1 to 12 
in subgroups of interest – pooled data, Studies 04 and 05 (Intent-to-treat analysis 
set) 
Efficacy of naloxegol in the treatment of OIC was not limited to any specific patient subgroup. The 
confidence intervals are wide for the RR of the “other” category within the subgroup of race for both the 
naloxegol 12.5 mg and 25 mg groups compared with the placebo groups, because of the small number of 
patients in that category (15, 11, and 6, in the placebo, naloxegol 12.5 mg, and naloxegol 25 mg groups, 
respectively), However, within all subgroups analyzed, confidence intervals around the treatment effect 
spanned those obtained for the overall population (Study 04 and 05 pooled). 
Although the treatment effect was consistent across all subgroups analyzed, a detailed discussion of 
response by baseline maintenance opioid (dose and type), and laxative response status is presented 
below. 
Baseline maintenance opioid (dose and type) 
Response to naloxegol was assessed in subgroups of patients taking high versus low opioid doses (≥200 
meu/day and < 200 meu/day, respectively) and in patients taking weak versus strong opioids. 
Approximately 80% of patients were receiving low doses of opioids at baseline (< 200 meu/day) and 
approximately 67% of patients were taking strong maintenance opioids at baseline in Studies 04 and 05. 
Overall, there was a higher response rate in the naloxegol groups compared with the placebo groups in all 
subgroups by baseline maintenance opioid dose and type, and the treatment effect of naloxegol increased 
with dose. 
A numerically larger treatment effect was observed in the high opioid dose group (≥200 meu/day) 
compared with the lower opioid dose group (<200 meu/day), which may be due to the lower placebo 
response rate observed in the high dose group (22.7%) compared with that of the lower opioid dose 
group (31.2%). In both of these subgroups, the response rate in the naloxegol 25 mg group was 
consistent with that seen in the overall population (44.9% and 41.1% in the high and low opioid dose 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/738815/2014

groups, respectively). Logistic regression of treatment-by baseline opioid dose in the individual studies 
failed to demonstrate a statistically significant treatment by baseline opioid dose interaction for either the 
naloxegol 12.5 mg or 25 mg groups. All of these analyses support the conclusion that naloxegol provides 
therapeutic benefit, regardless of opioid dose. 
There also appeared to be a trend towards a numerically larger treatment effect for naloxegol in the 
strong opioid subgroup compared with the weak opioid subgroup. A similar trend was noted in the 
pharmacometric modeling analysis where opioid type (weak vs strong) was the only baseline covariate 
meeting the threshold for inclusion in the final model. However, analysis of response rate by specific 
maintenance opioid at baseline (eg, oxycodone, hydrocodone, etc) demonstrates that CIs for each of the 
subgroups spanned those obtained in the overall population (Study 04 and 05 pooled). 
The median daily opioid dose was higher in the strong opioid group (132.5 meu/day) compared with the 
weak opioid group (45.0). Therefore, it is difficult to make any conclusions regarding these noted trends; 
it is possible that the trends are due to the opioid dose, the characteristics of the opioid molecule 
(weak/strong), or random variation. 
Laxative response status 
LIR/non-LIR subgroups 
Response to study drug during Weeks 1 to 12 by laxative response status using pooled data (Studies 04 
and 05) is summarized in table 8, comparing the LIR population with the non-LIR population. The majority 
of patients in the non-LIR population are LUR (96.6%). 
Table 8 CMH analysis of response rate for Weeks 1 to 12 by laxative response status 
– pooled data, Studies 04 and 05 (Intent-to-treat analysis set) 
In both the LIR and non-LIR subgroups, the number and percentage of patients responding increased with 
dose. However the magnitude of the treatment difference compared with placebo was larger 
in the LIR subgroup compared with the non-LIR subgroup. Improvements over placebo in change 
from baseline in mean SBMs/week and number of days per week with at least 1 SBM were also larger in 
the LIR subgroup compared to the non-LIR subgroup. 
In the LIR subgroups in both Studies 04 and 05, median times to first post-dose laxation was shorter in 
the naloxegol 12.5 mg (20.6 and 12.8 hours, respectively) and 25 mg (5.4 and 18.1 hours, respectively) 
groups compared with the placebo groups (43.4 and 38.2 hours, respectively). Although formal statistical 
testing was not performed for the non-LIR subgroup, in both Studies 04 and 05, median times to first 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/738815/2014  
Page 83/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
post-dose laxation was shorter in the naloxegol 12.5 mg (20.3 and 21.8 hours, respectively) and 25 mg 
(6.9 and 8.9 hours, respectively) groups compared with the placebo groups (34.8 and 33.9 hours, 
respectively). 
Change from baseline in straining, stool consistency, and percent days per week with at least 1 CSBM 
over 12 weeks in both the LIR and non-LIR groups were similar for the pooled data from Studies 04 and 
05 Table 9. 
Table 9 Analyses of change from baseline in daily OIC symptom data over 12 weeks 
by laxative response, pooled data, Studies 04 and 05 (Intent-to-treat analysis set) 
Evaluation of demographic factors and other baseline characteristics of the LIR and non-LIR populations 
that potentially could explain this difference did not reveal notable differences between the two 
populations. Therefore, since the majority of non-LIR patients are LUR (96.6%), the only factor that 
appears to be different between the LIR patients and the non-LIR patients is the extent of laxative use 
(≥4 days or <4 days) during the 2 weeks prior to study enrolment. The reason(s) for numerically higher 
12-week response rates in the LIR subgroup compared with the non-LIR subgroup in both studies are not 
known, at this time. Based on information from the OIC history module and laxative non-use 
questionnaire, it appears that many non-LIR patients had tried laxatives in the past (66% within 6 
months) but had stopped them for various reasons. 
2xLIR Subgroup 
Using pooled data from Studies 04 and 05, the primary efficacy endpoint was also analyzed in a subgroup 
of patients who had inadequate response to at least 2 classes of laxatives during previous opioid 
treatment (2xLIRs). 
Response to study drug in 2xLIR patients during Weeks 1 to 12 (Studies 04 and 05) is summarized using 
pooled data in Table 10.

Table 10 CMH analysis of response rate for 2xLIR patients – pooled data, Studies 04 
and 05 (Intent-to-treat analysis set) 
The results in the 2xLIR subgroup appear consistent with those observed in the overall population. 
Additional subgroup analyses 
A set of post-hoc analyses were conducted to further examine the treatment effect in additional 
subgroups. In this analysis, the BMI was categorized as per “normal” (<25 kg/m2), “overweight,”(>25 
and <30 kg/m2) and “obese” (>30 kg/m2), by categorizing the daily morphine equivalent dose into high 
and low categories (using a 120 meu/day threshold; this is an alternative categorization into high and low 
opioid doses recommended by the Washington State Medical Directors; AMDG 2010), and by the route of 
opioid administration (oral vs cutaneous). A caveat in the latter analysis is that many patients who were 
receiving opioids cutaneously (ie, transdermally) were also receiving a concomitant oral opioid. The 
results of these additional analyses were consistent with the subgroup analyses presented above, 
demonstrating a treatment effect for naloxegol compared with placebo, irrespective of the subgroup

Supportive studies 
•  STUDY 06 Study Code D3820C00006 
This was a Phase III, multi-centre placebo-controlled, double-blind study of NKTR-118 in patients with 
cancer-related pain and opioid-induced constipation (OIC).  
Approximately 672 patients were planned to be enrolled to obtain 336 randomized patients. The study 
was originally to be conducted at approximately 150 centres in the United States and 15 other countries. 
Due to recruitment challenges, enrolment to this study was stopped early. At the time that enrolment was 
stopped, 14 patients had been enrolled at 11 centres in the US, Poland, and the Czech Republic.  
Primary Objectives To compare the efficacy of NKTR-118 12.5 and 25 mg with placebo in the treatment 
of patients who have OIC in pain related to malignancy in a 4-week double-blind study (Part A).   
Secondary Objectives To compare NKTR-118 12.5 mg and 25 mg with placebo on the daily signs and 
symptoms associated with OIC (degree of straining, sensation of incomplete evacuation, and stool 
consistency), symptoms of constipation, and overall quality of life over a 4-week double-blind study (Part 
A). To characterize the maintenance of effect of NKTR-118 over a 12-week extension (Part B). To assess 
the safety and tolerability of NKTR-118 12.5 and 25 mg, when used for the treatment of OIC.

Subject population  
A total of 44 patients were enrolled in the study and of these, 14 were randomized (5 to NKTR-118 25 mg, 
5 to NKTR-118 12.5 mg, and 4 to placebo). All 14 randomized patients received treatment and went on 
to complete Part A of the study. Of the 14 completers of Part A, 9 patients (64.3%) continued into the 
single-blind extension Part B of the study (3 [60.0%] in the NKTR-118 25 mg group, 3 [60.0%] in the 
NKTR-118 12.5 mg group, and 3 [75.0%] in the placebo group).  
Results 
Fourteen patients were randomized across the 3 treatment groups (fewer than 5% of the planned 
number), thus, there was an insufficient number of patients to perform the protocol specified formal 
statistical analyses. 
Conclusions 
Due to the small numbers of patients randomized, treatment comparisons for efficacy and safety could 
not be made.  
•  STUDY 07 (Study code D3820C00007) 
This was a 12-week extension of the Phase III, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, 
placebo-controlled, parallel group 12 week study D3820C00004 to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 
NKTR-118 12.5 mg and 25 mg with placebo in the treatment of OIC in patients with non-cancer-related 
pain. Patients continued on their randomized dose from the D3820C00004 study. 
NKTR-118 12.5 or 25 mg tablets, or matching placebo, administered once daily. Study drug tablets were 
round, biconvex, and white film coated. Tablets were supplied in high-density polyethylene bottles, 
dispensed every 30 days. Each 30-day supply consisted of 2 bottles of study drug, each containing 35 
tablets. The duration of treatment was 12 weeks. The doses of NKTR-118 in the current study (12.5 mg 
and 25 mg) were the same doses as in Study D3820C00004.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to compare NKTR-118 12.5 mg and 25 mg with placebo regarding 
long-term safety and tolerability in the treatment of OIC using descriptive statistics. 
The secondary objectives were to assess the impact of NKTR-118 12.5 mg and 25 mg on symptoms of 
constipation and quality of life using PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL questionnaires. 
The exploratory objectives were to assess patient health status index and healthcare resource utilization. 
Subject population  
A total of 302 patients participated in Study D3820C00004 and continued in the double-blind treatment 
period of Study D3820C00007 at 52 study centers in the US (see Section 2). Similar numbers of patients 
were enrolled in each treatment group.  
Of the patients enrolled in the current study, 297 (98.3%) received treatment, and 245 (81.1%) 
completed the study (defined as completing Visit 4 [Week 24] for patients who continued into the 
D3820C00008 long-term safety study, or completing Visit 5 [Week 26] for patients who did not continue 
into the long-term study). 
Summary of main efficacy results 
The improvement for PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL across all 3 treatment groups observed in the 12-week 
confirmatory study in OIC patients was maintained in this extension study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/738815/2014  
Page 87/120 
 
 
 
 
 
Following the withdrawal of study treatment, there was a trend towards worsening in PAC-SYM and 
PAC-QOL domain scores in all treatment groups. The worsening was numerically larger in the NKTR-118 
treated groups compared with placebo, particularly in the PAC-SYM satisfaction domain. 
•  Study 08 D3820C00008 
This was a Phase III, 52-week, multi-center, open-label, randomized (2:1), parallel group, safety and 
tolerability study of NKTR-118 versus usual care in the treatment of OIC in patients with 
non-cancer-related pain. This was to have been a study with global participation, but all patients ended up 
being enrolled from the US. 
Target subject population and sample size  
Patients entering the study could enrol directly from 12-week pivotal study D3820C00005, directly from 
the 3-month safety extension (Study D3820C00007) of the 12-week pivotal study D3820C00004, or 
could be “new patients” who had not previously participated in a NKTR-118 study. Patients who enrolled 
from a previous study had no break or pause in treatment. 
Sample size 
No formal sample size calculation was performed for this long-term safety study. The sample size 
determination was based on the regulatory exposure requirement (ICH E1 [1994]) that at least 300 
patients had to complete 6 months of treatment with NKTR-118 25 mg and the number of patients 
randomized could have been adjusted during the study in order to achieve approximately 100 patients 
with at least 12 months of exposure to NKTR-118. 
Duration of treatment 
The study duration was 54 to 58 weeks. New patients underwent an initial screening period lasting up to 
2 weeks, a 2-week OIC confirmation period (during which the diagnosis of OIC and stability of opioid 
regimen were confirmed), and a 52-week treatment period, followed by a 2-week follow-up period. 
Statistical methods 
No formal statistical analyses were planned for any of the endpoints collected in this study. 
Subject population 
A total of 2393 patients enrolled, of which 2309 were new patients and 84 were roll-over patients. Of the 
2309 new patients who entered the initial study period, 760 patients completed the OIC confirmation 
period, were randomized, and entered the open-label treatment period. In addition, 84 roll-over patients 
were also randomized. Of the 844 patients randomized, a total of 288 patients (34.1%) who received 
treatment discontinued the study for any reason: 36.8% in the NKTR-118 25 mg group, and 28.8% in the 
Usual Care group. The most common reasons for study withdrawal were patient decision (12.8%) and AE 
(7.2%). A greater proportion of patients withdrew due to AE in the NKTR-118 25 mg group (9.9%) 
compared with the Usual Care group (1.8%), primarily driven by GI AEs. 
Efficacy results 
For the NKTR-118 25 mg treatment group, use of rescue medication was low and stable over the 
treatment period.

Safety results 
Long-term exposure to NKTR-118 25 mg, up to 52 weeks, was generally safe and well tolerated in the 
treatment of OIC patients with non-cancer related pain. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The efficacy of naloxegol in the treatment of OIC in non-cancer pain was assessed in the two phase III 
clinical trials D3820C00004 and D3820C00005. The studies enrolled adult patients with confirmed OIC in 
non-cancer pain according to predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. The doses of naloxegol used in 
the Phase III program (ie, 12.5 and 25 mg qd) were selected to explore the dosing regimen associated 
with optimal benefit/risk. The naloxegol 25 mg qd dose was selected based on efficacy and tolerability 
demonstrated in the 4-week Phase IIb study. In order to continue exploring the threshold for a minimally 
efficacious dose, the 12.5 mg qd dose was included in the Phase III program. The dose selection was 
supported by pharmacometric modelling.  
In line with ICH Guideline E10, placebo was used to provide control for normal disease course and other 
non-specific factors. During the design and conduct of the Phase III program, no oral treatments for OIC 
had consistently demonstrated efficacy in clinical trials for this condition or had been approved by Health 
Authorities for use in this indication. Naloxegol in this program in non-cancer pain patients has been 
studied as maintenance monotherapy and not as an add-on therapy to laxatives.  
The studies were performed as randomised placebo controlled trials and adequately designed with 90% 
power to detect a 25% difference in response between treatment and placebo. An active control arm 
including treatment with standard laxatives could have put the efficacy of naloxegol in perspective, 
especially as the endpoint of the studies aimed to show prolonged treatment efficacy but trials 04 and 05 
can be considered broadly in line with the current draft guideline on the clinical investigation of medicinal 
products for the treatment of chronic constipation.  
The primary efficacy study endpoint assessed both the magnitude and duration of treatment effect in the 
study population (number of responders). The first key secondary endpoint assessed the number of 
responders in the LIR subgroup, a subgroup of patients that responds inadequately to standard laxatives. 
Since about half of patients suffering from OIC do not respond adequately to standard laxatives, there 
appears to be a medical need for additional therapeutic options in this patient population. Notable 
occurrences during the conduct of the Phase III studies are summarized here. To address these, applicant 
declared that appropriate actions were taken: 1) Patients who had previously or concurrently participated 
in the naloxegol program at another study center were identified prior to database lock of each study, and 
were excluded from relevant analysis sets in each study. The number of such patients was small (15 in 
Studies 04 and 05, and 16 in Study 08) and similar between treatment groups; 2) After initial locking of 
the database for Study 05, data associated with one patient that was previously assessed as 
non-retrievable was found to be retrievable. Following applicant standard operating procedures this was 
considered a critical error, thus, these data were added to the database and the database was again 
locked and underwent a final analysis; and 3) an internal site audit, identified data integrity issues 
affecting 2 sites in Study 08. All patients from these sites (24 patients, 4 of these were patients who 
previously or concurrently participated at other study centers) were excluded from the safety analyses of 
the study.   
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/738815/2014  
Page 89/120 
 
 
 
 
 
The implementation of protocol amendments (please refer to description of the studies above) did not 
have a significant effect on the composition of the study population or the interpretation of the study 
results. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Efficacy was measured as response rate in the study population, being the primary endpoint, in duplicate 
studies 04 and 05, investigating the effect of naloxegol 12.5 mg and 25 mg versus placebo treatment.  
In study D3820C00004 relevant efficacy and durability of effect of Naloxegol was tested through the 
primary endpoint of response to study drug, as defined by >3 SBMs per week and a change from baseline 
of >1 SBM per week for at least 9 out of the 12 study weeks and 3 out of the last 4 weeks of the study. 
For a patient to be considered a responder under this definition of response, a durable improvement in 
SBMs had to have been observed over the entire 12-week treatment period. A statistically significant 
improvement for the primary variable was observed for both Naloxegol dose groups compared with the 
placebo group, with the difference in responder rate meeting a clinically relevant difference of 10% for 
both doses.  
Similar results were observed for the response rates in the LIR subgroup, a key secondary endpoint. 
Statistical significance was also observed for both Naloxegol dose groups compared with placebo for the 
other key secondary endpoints; time to first post-dose SBM and mean number of days per week with at 
least 1 SBM. The median time to first post-dose SBM was 35.8, 20.4, and 5.9 hours for the placebo, 12.5 
mg and 25 mg NKTR-118 groups, respectively, demonstrating a clinically relevant improvement.  
All secondary endpoints, as well as sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint, were supportive of and 
consistent with the primary endpoint that established a clinically relevant durable efficacy over 12 weeks. 
The observed treatment effect in the LIR subgroup was numerically greater than in the non-LIR subgroup 
across the primary and most secondary endpoints. There was no significant interaction between baseline 
opioid dose and response to NKTR-118 within the dose range of opioids studied. Some other secondary 
endpoints, which were not included in the multiple testing procedure, supported the efficacy of Naloxegol 
25 mg in the treatment of OIC.  
A numerical improvement in straining, stool consistency and mean % days per week with at least 1 CSBM 
was observed for the Naloxegol 25 mg group compared to the placebo group; the improvement in 
straining and stool consistency was numerically modest. The results of  PAC-SYM and PAC-QOL scales are 
mostly negative (ie. there were not statistically significant in comparison to placebo). 
The results of study D3820C00005 can be summarized as follows: 
o  Statistically significant higher response rates were observed in the Naloxegol 25 mg treatment 
group compared with placebo over 12 weeks in patients with OIC (p=0.021). The Naloxegol 12.5 
mg dose did not demonstrate statistical significance for the primary variable (p=0.202), and as 
such, statistical significance could not be claimed for key secondary variables regardless of effect. 
o 
In the pre-specified LIR subgroup, statistically significant higher response rates were observed in 
the Naloxegol 25 mg group compared with placebo over 12 weeks in patients with OIC who had 
inadequate response to laxatives in the past (p=0.014). The p-value for the Naloxegol 12.5 
treatment group compared with placebo was 0.074. 
o  Statistically significant shorter time to first post-dose SBM was observed in the Naloxegol 25 mg 
treatment group compared with placebo (p<0.001). The unadjusted p-value for the Naloxegol 
12.5 treatment group compared with placebo was <0.001. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/738815/2014  
Page 90/120 
 
 
 
 
 
o  There was a statistically significant increase in the mean number of days per week with at least 1 
SBM at Week 12 in the Naloxegol 25 mg treatment group compared with placebo (p<0.001). The 
unadjusted p-value for the Naloxegol 12.5 mg treatment group compared with placebo was 
0.010. 
o 
Improvement was observed for all individual OIC symptoms assessed (straining, stool 
consistency, days/week with CSBM) in the Naloxegol 25 mg (<0.001 for all) and 12.5 mg 
(p=0.005, p=0.001, and p=0.002, respectively) treatment groups compared with placebo. 
o  Results from analysis over 4 weeks were consistent with the results over 12 weeks. 
o 
Improvement in the severity of symptoms of constipation in OIC patients by Week 12 was 
observed for the stool domain and rectal domain of PAC-SYM in the Naloxegol 25 mg treatment 
group compared with placebo (p<0.001 for both domains). There was no relevant difference in 
the magnitude of improvement for the abdominal domain of PAC-SYM across treatment groups by 
Week 12 (p=0.279). 
o  There was an improvement in quality of life for all treatment groups. For the satisfaction domain 
of PAC-QOL, improvement compared with placebo was observed for both the Naloxegol 25 mg 
and 12.5 mg treatment groups at Week 12 (p<0.001 and p=0.011, respectively). 
In summary in study 05 no statistical significance for the primary endpoint of the 12.5 mg arm and 
borderline statistical significance for the 25 mg naloxegol arm were shown. Response rates for the 25 mg 
naloxegol group were 44.4% and 39.7% (placebo: 29.4% and 29.3%) in studies 04 and 05, respectively, 
for the primary endpoint, and 48.7% and 46.8% (placebo: 28.8% and 31.4%) in studies 04 and 05, 
respectively, for the first key secondary endpoint (i.e. the response rate in the LIR subgroup). 
A 10% - 15% treatment effect compared to placebo was demonstrated in studies 04 and 05 for both the 
primary and first key secondary endpoint. This effect was higher in the LIR subgroup than in the non-LIR 
subgroup of patients. 
The totality of the data presented in the LIR subgroup provides evidence to support a clinically meaningful 
benefit in these patients. The clinical relevance of the treatment effect is less clear in the general 
population of non-LIR patients, which is likely to be a heterogeneous group. The treatment effects in the 
overall study population appear to be driven by the data of the LIR subgroup in both trial 04 and 
05.whereas only modest treatment effect was seen in the non LIR subgroup.  
The applicant attempted a large global dedicated study in the cancer patient population suffering from 
OIC, but due to severe and persistent recruitment challenges, enrollment had to be stopped early. There 
is no published evidence that opioid receptor pharmacology, density, or location in cancer pain patients is 
substantially different from that of non-cancer pain patients. Therefore, there appear to be no scientific 
rationale to expect the pharmacodynamic properties of naloxegol to differ in this patient population.  This 
assumption has been considered acceptable by the CHMP. Additional safety data will be collected post 
authorization on an ongoing basis as outlined in the RMP so that a patient population with high medical 
need is not deprived of the option to seek benefit with a new oral treatment option.  
The totality of the data, in the LIR subgroup, provides evidence to support a clinically meaningful benefit 
in these patients. From the data presented by the company, the clinical relevance of the treatment effect 
is less clear in the general population of non-LIR patients, which is likely to be a heterogeneous group. 
Therefore, following analysis of the data provided, the applicant proposes to limit the therapeutic 
indication to adult OIC patients with an inadequate response to laxatives.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of naloxegol (12.5 and 25 mg) was assessed in two pivotal phase III clinical trials in the 
general non-cancer OIC population and the LIR subgroup of patients typed by an inadequate response to 
standard laxatives, with the primary endpoint being the percentage of responders versus placebo. The 
primary efficacy endpoint was assessed over a period of 12 weeks to reflect the chronic nature of the 
treatment. The effect sizes observed in study 05 are much smaller than in study 04 resulting in absence 
of statistical significance for the primary endpoint of the 12.5 mg naloxegol arm and borderline statistical 
significance for the 25 mg treatment arm. The observed absolute and relative treatment effects are 
smaller than expected: an absolute effect of 39.7 % and 44.4% with 60% expected and a relative effect 
over placebo of 10.4% and 15% with 25% expected in studies 05 and 04, respectively, in the 25 mg 
naloxegol treatment arm. The effect size appears not to be sufficient to warrant a first line therapeutic 
indication in the general patient population with OIC, although head to head comparison with standard 
laxatives and similar drugs could be very informative to evaluate the true relative effect of naloxegol, 
especially since the primary endpoint of this study incorporated the assessment of treatment over a 
prolonged period of 12 weeks.  
As mentioned before, the treatment response rate is clearly imbalanced between LIR and non-LIR 
subgroup with the LIR response driving the general treatment response. The CHMP therefore considers 
that a clinically relevant treatment effect is observed in the LIR subgroup of OIC patients. The indication 
has been adapted accordingly to the use to LIR population only. 
It is not anticipated that the method of action or the efficacy of the product will change in OIC patients 
with cancer-related pain. However, some of these patients may present with additional safety issues, for 
which a contraindication was added in the SmPC as outlined in above discussion. In addition it is outlined 
in the SmPC that based on the limited experience with the use of naloxegol caution should be used when 
prescribing the drug to such patients. Safety in these patients will be monitored closely and the missing 
information will additionally be addressed within a PASS as detailed in the RMP.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety of naloxegol was investigated in 4 Phase III studies and 1 Phase IIb study in patients with OIC 
taking opioid analgesics. In addition, 3 biopharmaceutical studies and 11 clinical pharmacology studies 
provide safety data. All of these studies were complete at the time of the data cut off (see Table 1).  
In the Phase IIb and III naloxegol clinical studies, 1497 unique patients were exposed to naloxegol at 1 
or more doses (33 to 5 mg, 446 to 12.5 mg, 999 to 25 mg, and 35 to 50 mg) and included in the safety 
analyses. For the 25 mg dose, 464 patients were exposed for at least 24 weeks, 317 were exposed for at 
least 51 weeks, and 96 were exposed for at least 52 weeks. In addition, 438 volunteers were exposed to 
naloxegol in the Phase I studies (at doses of 5 to 1000 mg). The recommendations for minimal patient 
exposure to the product in a clinical program for long term treatment of non-life threatening conditions 
were fully respected.

The Phase III data are the main source for evaluating safety and tolerability of naloxegol. The primary 
analyses sets are the 12-week pool (Study 04 and 05) and Study 08 for long-term safety data (52 weeks). 
Supporting data pools were also used to help characterize naloxegol’s safety and tolerability profile. 
These include the following pools: 24-week integrated dataset (Studies 04 and 07), placebo-controlled 
pool (Studies 04, 05, and 07), Phase IIb/III AE pool for all OIC patients, and the Phase I pool. Other 
studies contributing safety data involve the Phase IIb study and the Phase III study 06.

The pooling proposed is considered as acceptable. The primary pool set has been divided in short term 
studies (study 04 and 05) and in long term exposure (study 08), this set has been used to evaluate 
exposure, demographics, study withdrawals, concomitant medications, AEs (including deaths, SAEs, 
DAEs, and AEOSIs), laboratory data, VS, ECG, body weight/BMI, NRS, mHS, opioid dose, abuse potential, 
C-SSRS. On the other side, the supportive data set will be used to confirm AEs and exposure. However a 
potential selection bias was introduced in the study 07 and 08. Only patients that have completed the 
study 04 or 05 were eligible to be enrolled in the study 07 or 08. In order to provide a robust assessment 
of the safety, patients from the study 07 and patients who were eligible were introduced in the dataset. 
In the study 08, which includes a majority of newly enrolled patients, a new randomisation was performed 
at the beginning of the study. Therefore, long term safety study 08 has been considered as the main 
safety pool and the data from study 07 has only been used as additional supportive information.  
Demographic characteristics are equivalent between the main studies: studies 04, 05, 07 and 08 (data 
not shown for clinical studies 07 and 08). Most of the patients taking Naloxegol 12,5 or 25mg are white 
people from North America and they are aged of approximately 50 years old. More than 60% of the 
patients are female taking a mean opioid morphine equivalent dose (MED) of 148 meu for 45 months. 
Adverse events 
In the 12-week pool, the incidence of SAEs was similar across treatment groups, while the incidence of 
any AE and the incidence of DAEs were higher in the naloxegol 25 mg group than in the placebo and 
naloxegol 12.5 mg treatment groups (see Table 2). In Study 08, the incidence of AEs and SAEs was 
similar between the Usual Care and naloxegol 25 mg groups. The incidence of DAEs could not be 
compared between treatments, because patients in the Usual Care group were not taking IP and therefore 
by definition could not have a DAE. Therefore, Among patients enrolled in Study 04 or Study 05, the 
relative risk (vs. placebo) of experiencing at least 1 AE of any kind during the treatment period was 1.03 
(95% CI: 0.85, 1.23) for patients receiving naloxegol 12.5 mg and 1.30 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.55) for patients 
receiving naloxegol 25 mg

Table 2: Number of patients who had 1 or more AE in any category during the treatment period 
The most frequently reported AEs were primarily GI AEs, which is not unexpected given the naloxegol 
mechanism of action, moreover most adverse events were mild to moderate in intensity. They tended to 
occur during the first 7 days of treatment for all doses, although in the naloxegol 25 mg group, they were 
reported later as well (see Table 3). 
Table 3: Number of patients with the most common AEs during the 12-weeks treatment period 
As in the 12-week pool, in Study 08, the most common AEs among naloxegol-treated patients were 
abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and nausea (respectively 17.8% vs. 3.3% in the Usual Care group, 
Assessment report

12.9% vs. 5.9% in the Usual Care group, and 9.4% vs. 4.1% in the Usual Care group). In addition, the 
following AEs had an incidence ≥5% in the naloxegol 25 mg group and at least twice the incidence in the 
Usual Care group: flatulence (6.9% vs. 1.1%) and abdominal pain upper (5.1% vs. 1.1%). In the long 
term, the first onset of AEs of abdominal pain, headache, and flatulence was more frequently reported 
during the initial 12-week period. 
Analysis of adverse events of special interest 
•  As peripherally acting mμ-opioid receptor antagonist, NGL such as methylnaltrexone, may be 
involved in GI perforation event. All patients at increased risk of GI perforation were excluded 
from clinical trials and no AEs reported as bowel perforation in any naloxegol-treated patient were 
detected. The potential risk of developing GI perforation upon NGL is adequately addressed in the 
product information. 
• 
In an alvimopan long-term safety study in 805 patients with opioid bowel dysfunction, increased 
rates of CV events such as myocardial infarction (MI) were observed. According to the prescribing 
information for alvimopan, “A causal relationship with alvimopan has not been established.”; 
therefore, the implications of this isolated finding for alvimopan and for the PAMORA class are 
unclear. However, to ensure that the risk of MACE was fully understood, all serious CV events 
(and selected non-serious CV AEs of interest) occurring in the Phase III clinical studies of 
naloxegol were adjudicated by an independent external CV event adjudication committee 
(CV-EAC). The incidence of CV-related AEs in the Phase III program with onset during either the 
treatment period or the post-treatment follow-up period that were severe, serious, and/or led to 
discontinuation of naloxegol was low and similar across treatment groups in the 12-week pool 
(1.4% for placebo and naloxegol 12.5 mg, 1.6% for naloxegol 25 mg) and in Study 08 (2.9% for 
Usual Care and 2.1% for naloxegol 25 mg). Overall, no clinically important CV safety signal was 
observed in the naloxegol clinical program. Decrease and increased BP events were also similar 
between treatment groups. On the other syncope incidents were only detected in the NGL groups 
and should be further investigated by the Applicant (see Table 4).

•  Naloxegol has limited capacity to pass through the blood-brain barrier, and thus central opioid 
antagonism is unlikely at doses relevant to its anticipated use in patients with OIC. However, to 
better understand and quantify any theoretical risk of CNS opioid antagonism, pain intensity (as 
measured  by  the  NRS  and  opioid  dose)  were  continually  assessed  throughout  the  Phase  III 
studies. Following study 04 and 05, based on both mean daily average pain scores and mean 
worst pain scores from daily diary entries, there was no evidence that naloxegol interfered with 
analgesia: there were no clinically important changes in NRS pain scores from baseline in any 
treatment group. For the naloxegol 25 mg group in the 12-week pool (Studies 04 and 05), there 
was a small imbalance in the frequency of (sometimes overlapping) reports of back pain and pain 
in extremity, while no treatment imbalances were detected in the longer-term studies, Studies 07 
and 08. After a careful review, this small imbalance in the 12-week pool does not appear to be 
causally related or clinically important. Moreover there were no unexpected, clinically meaningful 
trends (increasing or decreasing) in daily opioid dose with the use of naloxegol. More patients in 
the  NGL  groups  presented  with  mHS  signs  (see  Table  5),  hyperhidrosis  is  the  most  frequent 
symptom, in most of the patients this symptom is associated with GI AEs  
Table 5: Number of patients with AEs related to the mHS signs during the treatment period 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were a total of 7 deaths in naloxegol clinical program: 5 in the Phase III studies, 1 in the Phase II 
study, and I in the Phase I studies. Of the 6 deaths in OIC patients, 1 occurred in the Usual Care group in 
Study 08 (0.4%), 3 occurred in patients in naloxegol 12.5 mg groups (0.7%), and 2 occurred in patients 
in naloxegol 25 mg groups (0.2%, 1 in Phase III, 1 in Phase IIb). No common etiological basis was 
identified; furthermore, neither the Investigator nor the applicant consider any of these individual cases 
to be related to study treatment. 
The incidence of SAEs was similar across treatment groups, with no dose ordering and no SOC or PT 
predominating. Pneumonia was the most frequently reported SAE overall, with no notable imbalance in 
frequency across treatment groups (incidence <1% in all groups). 
Laboratory findings 
Review of pooled and individual study haematology data, clinical chemistry data and urinalysis parameter 
did not reveal any notable imbalance between treatment groups for any parameter with respect to mean 
changes, shifts from normal baseline values to abnormal on-treatment values, or the pattern or 
frequency of PCI values. However a small imbalance can be detected for the TSH level. A review of the 
individual cases revealed that the small imbalance in low TSH level incidence is mostly due to pre-existing

hypothyroidism in 16 patients treated with levothyroxine (14 in the NGL 25 mg group). These patients 
were not subject to an increased incidence of GI AEs (see Table 6). 
Table 6: Summary of PCI laboratory abnormalities during the treatment period 
Safety in special populations 
A population PK analysis was conducted. Among the demographic and baseline characteristics included in 
the covariate analysis (i.e., age, race, sex, weight, baseline creatinine clearance, type of opioid, opioid 
dose, baseline laxative responder status, concomitant weak/moderate/strong CYP3A4 inhibitor/inducer, 
concomitant P-gp inhibitor/inducer), only race and concomitant administration of strong and moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors showed significant changes in naloxegol exposure. Among Black subjects, slightly 
(20%) lower exposure was observed. Among Asian subjects, a reduced volume of distribution resulting in 
a 25-30% higher Cmax was observed. These findings regarding the effects of race were considered to be 
small differences with limited impact.  
No apparent differential effect of naloxegol was detected on either overall AE incidence or the incidence of 
AEs by SOC and PT based on sex, age, race, BMI, geographic region, baseline LIR/non-LIR status, or 
baseline opioid dose, where the number of subjects was large enough to allow interpretation of the 
results. For patients with a baseline opioid dose of at least 200 meus, there was a higher incidence of AEs 
across all treatment groups, particularly in the GI SOC. Nearly 75% of the patients treated with an opioid 
dose ≥200 meu had an AEs and 70% of these AEs were in the gastro-intestinal SOC. In the long term 
safety study, an increase of AEs prevalence was also detected for patients taking high dose of opioid (see 
Table 7).  
The results of Study 09 indicate that subjects with moderate to severe renal impairment have higher 
average Cmax and AUC than subjects with normal renal function. Despite the higher average exposure in 
moderately and severely renal-impaired subjects, the safety profile of naloxegol in subjects with renal

impairment at baseline was similar to patients with normal baseline creatinine clearance values. 
Furthermore, the subjects with unusually high exposure in the moderate and severe renal impairment 
groups exhibited no differences in tolerability profile. There were no clinically relevant changes in 
laboratory, vital sign, ECG or physical exam data in the subjects enrolled in Study 09. 
Table 7: Number of subjects with AEs during the treatment period, by subgroup. 
The observed AE profile was similar between patients <65 years of age compared with patients >65 years 
of age. The lower number of patients >65 years of age makes comparative assessments of low-frequency 
events challenging. For most of the event categories in the table below, the AE rate was similar between 
those <65 years of age and ≥65 years of age. SAE rates for placebo and Usual Care cohorts were 7.5% 
and 14.7%, respectively, for patients ≥65 years of age and 6.1% and 10.7%, respectively, for patients 
<65 years of age.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug/food interaction 
The effect of eating a meal prior to administration of naloxegol was studied in biopharmaceutical studies. 
The clinical studies have shown that exposure (i.e., AUC) increases by 42% to 55% and maximum plasma 
concentration increase by 30% to 47% when a 25 mg dose of naloxegol is administered after eating a 
meal, compared with fasting conditions. A related statement was added in the SmPC mentioning that 
naloxegol should be taken on an empty stomach at least 30 minutes prior to the first meal of the day. 
Drug/drug interaction 
In vitro data indicate that naloxegol is a substrate of CYP3A as well as a P-gp transporter, and that CYP3A 
is the major CYP enzyme responsible for the metabolism of naloxegol. Thus the metabolism, distribution 
(e.g. CNS penetration) and disposition of naloxegol may be altered by drugs that interfere with CYP3A or 
P-gp. As such, studies of interactions between naloxegol and morphine, ketoconazole, rifampin, 
quinidine, and dilitazem have been conducted as part of the naloxegol clinical development program. 
There was no important difference in the frequency or pattern of AEs between patients who received

moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors during the study and the overall safety population. Specified 
amendments have been added in the SmPC. 
A post hoc analysis of AEs in the subgroup of patients taking methadone was conducted when it was 
observed that these patients were disproportionately represented in the small group of patients with AEs 
of opioid withdrawal. All of the patients on methadone with AEs of opioid withdrawal had concurrent GI 
AEs. GI AE rates during the study were higher in the subgroup of patients in the 12-week pool who were 
taking methadone than in the overall safety population, particularly in the naloxegol 25 mg group. In the 
12 weeks study, more than 80% of the patient treated with methadone and NGL 25mg had AEs, mostly 
a GI AEs (see Table 8). For this specific population, approximately 25% of the patients will experience AEs 
under the NGL 25mg treatment that they would not have under the placebo treatment. The potential for 
a pharmacodynamic interaction at the opioid receptor has been characterised. Since both methadone and 
naloxegol bind to opioid receptors in the GI tract, an interaction was expected. Many of the side effects of 
naloxegol in the GI tract may reflect supra-pharmacological effects; that is, improved GI peristalsis may 
lead to GI cramps, and reduced water absorption may lead to diarrhoea. Unlike morphine, methadone is 
efficient at inducing μ-opioid receptor endocytosis, an important mechanism in ensuring that desensitised 
and internalized receptors are rapidly recycled to the cell surface in an active form, maintaining receptor 
signalling, and reducing receptor desensitisation and tolerance development. This reason appropriately 
explains the AEs occurring with concomitant use of Naloxegol and methadone.  In the long term safety 
study, patients who were receiving methadone as long term treatment were excluded from the study. 
Table 8: Incidence of any AE and any AE during the treatment or post treatment period: overall 
population and patients on methadone. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the 12-week pool, most DAEs occurred during the first 4 weeks of treatment. The most common DAEs 
among naloxegol-treated patients in the 12-week pool were diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and nausea (see 
Table 9). The overall DAE rate was higher in the naloxegol 25 mg group than in both of the other groups, 
which appeared to be driven predominantly by treatment differences in the incidence of diarrhoea and 
abdominal pain DAEs.

Table 9: Number  of patients  who  had  a DAE that was  reported  for 2 patients  or  more in any 
treatment group. 
The frequency and pattern of DAEs in Study 08 were similar to those seen in the naloxegol 25 mg group 
in the 12-week studies. Note that patients in the Usual Care group were not taking IP and therefore could 
not have DAEs. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety of NGL was investigated in 4 phase III studies and 1 Phase IIb study. Four studies were 
double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled (study 04, 05, 07 and phase IIb) while one long term study 
was open label vs usual care (study 08). The duration of the placebo controlled studies was 12 weeks 
(except 4 weeks for the Phase IIb study) which is appropriate regarding the indication. 12,5 and 25mg 
daily doses of NGL were evaluated in short- and mid-term study while only 25mg daily doses were tested 
on long term study (52 weeks).  
The pooling strategy of the patients involved in these studies is considered acceptable. The primary pool 
set has been  divided in short term (study 04 and 05) and long term exposure (study 08), this population 
has been used to evaluate exposure, demographics, study withdrawals, concomitant medications, AEs 
(including deaths, SAEs, DAEs), laboratory data, VS, ECG, body weight/BMI, NRS, mHS, opioid dose, 
abuse potential. The supportive data set is composed of four patient populations, one of those is the 24 
weeks integrated data set (study 07),  the placebo controlled pool (study 04, 05 and 07), the phase 
IIb/phase III pool and the Phase I pool.

• 
The incidence of SAEs was similar across treatment groups with no dose ordering and no SOC or 
PT predominating. Pneumonia was the most frequently reported SAE, with no notable imbalance 
in frequency across treatment groups. Patient’s narratives for these SAEs were reviewed and did 
not point any safety concern. 
•  Seven deaths occurred during the clinical programs but none of these individual cases was 
considered to be related to the study treatment. 
• 
The incidence of common AEs (especially gastrointestinal AEs) was higher for patients upon NGL 
25mg treatment. The most frequently reported AEs were GI AEs (abdominal pain, diarrhoea, 
nausea, flatulence, ...). They tended to occur in the first 7 days and their numbers are dose 
dependant. The Applicant considers that these GI AEs are not unexpected considering the 
pharmacological properties of NGL.  
•  During 12 weeks study, the overall DAE rate was higher in the naloxegol 25 mg group and 
appeared to be driven predominantly by the incidence of severe diarrhoea and abdominal pain. 
No conclusion can be drawn regarding the proportion of patients who have completed the 52 
weeks study considering that patients in the usual care group may at any time modify the 
treatment and/or the posology.  
•  No clinically important CV safety signals were observed during the studies. However, a small 
imbalance in the incidence of increase BP and syncope events was detected and further 
investigated by the Applicant. These events were added to the RMP as Important and Potential 
risks respectively and a PASS to characterize the CV risk and Major Adverse Cardiac Events such 
as MI, CVA, and cardiac death has been included in the Pharmacovigilance plan of the RMP. 
•  According to pain measurement (NRS pain scores), NGL did not interfere with analgesia and no 
unexpected changes in daily opioid doses were detected. Despite some imbalance in reporting of 
hyperhidrosis and pain, no clear signs of opioid withdrawal symptoms were detected during NGL 
treatments. Nevertheless the risk of opioid withdrawal cannot be totally excluded and is 
mentioned in the SmPC. 
• 
• 
In vitro data and PK analyses indicate that naloxegol is a substrate of CYP3A as well as a P-gp 
transporter but there was no important difference in the frequency or pattern of AEs between 
patients who received moderate or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors during the study and the overall 
safety population. 
Patients with a baseline opioid dose of at least 200 meus or taking methadone, presented higher 
incidence of AEs across all treatment groups, particularly in the GI SOC. The Applicant proposed 
as explanation that the number and the activity of the opioid receptor have decreased with the 
“down regulation of opioid receptors”. The remaining receptors become more active and 
sensitive, leading to higher effects of the NGL therapy and also to higher reporting of GI AEs. In 
this context, the Applicant proposed a reduced starting dose of 12,5mg for patients treated with 
opioid at higher dose than 200meus or treated with methadone. Nevertheless, Naloxegol 25 mg 
has also a higher incidence of AE compared to 12.5 mg indicating only a limited impact on the 
number of treatment responders and suggesting that most clinically important GI AEs or DAEs 
occur in non-responders. Therefore, the most efficacious dose, 25 mg naloxegol, should be used 
in these patients. If patients do not tolerate the 25 mg naloxegol dose, treatment can be lowered 
to a 12.5 mg dose.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Naloxegol at doses up to 25 mg once daily was generally safe and well tolerated in patients with OIC. 
Nonetheless a notable imbalance identified between treatment and placebo groups in clinical trials was GI 
AEs. The incidence and the duration of the GI AEs was dose dependent and began at the early stage of the 
treatment. This difference may lead to a serious increase of DAEs in the 25mg NGL groups and may be 
related to the daily opioid dose taken by the patients. At high doses of opioids, the number and the 
activity of the opioid receptors are falling and the patient becomes more sensitive to the effect of NGL 
leading to increased activity and increased number of GI AEs. If the initial dose is not tolerated by the 
patient of this subgroup, a reduction to 12.5mg daily may be implemented. On the other hand, the risk of 
MACE, reversal of analgesia and other opioid withdrawal symptoms was correctly assessed according to 
robust safety data. Patients at increased risk of GI perforation were excluded from clinical studies and 
therefore the impact of NGL on these patients could not be studied. All these potential risks are addressed 
in the SmPC and PIL documents.

Clinically important GI AEs 
Section 4.4 (Special warnings and precautions 
for use) of the SmPC contains the following: 
None 
Reports of severe abdominal pain and 
diarrhoea have been observed in clinical trials 
with the 25 mg dose, typically occurring 
shortly after initiation of treatment. There was 
a higher incidence of discontinuations in 
patients taking the 25mg dose compared to 
placebo due to diarrhoea (0.7% for placebo 
versus 3.1% for naloxegol 25 mg) and 
abdominal pain (0.2% versus 2.9%, 
respectively).  Patients should be advised to 
promptly report severe, persistent or 
worsening symptoms to their physician.  
Consideration may be given to lowering the 
dose to 12.5mg in patients experiencing 
severe gastrointestinal adverse events 
depending upon the response and tolerability 
of individual patients. 
Statement within Section 4.8 (Undesirable 
effects) of the SmPC lists the following terms: 
Abdominal pain 
Diarrhoea 
Flatulence 
Nausea 
Vomiting 
Opioid Withdrawal Syndrome  Section 4.4 (Special warnings and precautions 
None 
for use) of the SmPC contains the following 
statement: 
Clinically important disruptions of the 
blood-brain barrier: 
Naloxegol is a peripherally acting mu-opioid 
receptor antagonist with restricted access to 
the central nervous system (CNS). The 
blood-brain barrier integrity is important for 
minimizing naloxegol uptake into the CNS. 
Patients with clinically important disruptions to 
the blood-brain barrier (e.g. primary brain 
malignancies, CNS metastases or other 
inflammatory conditions, active multiple 
sclerosis, advanced Alzheimer’s disease etc.) 
were not included in clinical studies and may 
be at risk for naloxegol entry into the CNS. 
Naloxegol should be prescribed with caution in 
such patients taking into account their 
individual benefit-risk balance with 
observation for potential CNS effects, such as 
symptoms of opioid withdrawal and/or 
interference with opioid mediated analgesia. If 
evidence for interference with opioid mediated 
analgesia or opioid withdrawal syndrome 
occurs, patients should be instructed to 
discontinue Moventig and contact their 
physician. 
Section 4.8 (Undesirable effects) of the SmPC 
lists opioid withdrawal syndrome with a

frequency of uncommon and the following 
note: 
Naloxegol at therapeutic doses has minimal 
uptake across the blood-brain barrier. In some 
patients, however, a constellation of 
symptoms has been reported, which 
resembles the syndrome of central opioid 
withdrawal. Most such reports were observed 
shortly after initial administration with the 
drug and were mild or moderate in intensity. 
Interactions with drugs 
modulating CYP3A4 or P-gp 
activities 
SmPC Section 4.4 (Special warnings and 
precautions for use):  
Moventig is not recommended in patients who 
are taking strong CYP3A4 inducers (see 
section 4.4). 
None 
SmPC Section 4.5:  
Interaction with CYP3A4 inhibitors and 
inducers 
Interaction with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
In an open-label, non-randomized, 
fixed-sequence, 3-period, 3-treatment, 
crossover study to evaluate the effect of 
multiple doses of ketoconazole on the single 
dose PK of naloxegol, co-administration of 
ketoconazole and naloxegol resulted in a 
12.9-fold  (90% CI: 11.3-14.6) increase 
naloxegol AUC and a 9.6-fold increase in 
naloxegol Cmax (90% CI: 8.1-11.3), 
compared to when naloxegol was 
administered alone. Therefore, concomitant 
use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). Grapefruit 
juice has been classified as a potent CYP3A4 
inhibitor when consumed in large quantities. 
No data are available on the concomitant use 
of naloxegol with grapefruit juice. 
Concomitant consumption of grapefruit juice 
while taking naloxegol should generally be 
avoided and considered only in consultation 
with a healthcare provider (see section 4.4). 
Interaction with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors 
In an open-label, nonrandomized, 
fixed-sequence, 3-period, 3-treatment, 
crossover study to evaluate the effect of 
multiple doses of diltiazem on the single dose 
PK of naloxegol, co-administration of diltiazem 
and naloxegol resulted in a 3.4-fold  (90% CI: 
3.2-3.7) increase in naloxegol AUC and a 
2.9-fold increase in naloxegol Cmax (90% CI: 
2.6-3.1), compared to when naloxegol was 
administered alone. Therefore, a 
dose-adjustment of naloxegol is 
recommended when co-administered with 
diltiazem and other moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitors (see section 4.2). The starting dose 
for patients taking moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitors is 12.5 mg once daily and the dose 
can be increased to 25 mg if 12.5 mg is well

tolerated by the patient (see section 4.2). 
No dosage adjustment is required for patients 
taking weak CYP3A4 inhibitors. 
Interaction with strong CYP3A4 inducers 
In an open-label, nonrandomized, 
fixed-sequence, 3-period, 3-treatment, 
single-dose, crossover study to evaluate the 
effect of multiple doses of rifampin on the 
single dose PK of naloxegol, co-administration 
of rifampin and naloxegol resulted in a 89% 
(90% CI: 88%-90%) decrease in naloxegol 
AUC and a 76% decrease in naloxegol Cmax 
(90% CI: 69%-80%), compared to when 
naloxegol was administered alone. Therefore, 
Moventig is not recommended in patients who 
are taking strong CYP3A4 inducers (see 
section 4.4). 
Interaction with P-gp inhibitors 
A double-blind, randomized, 2-part, 
crossover, single center study was conducted 
to evaluate the effect of quinidine on the 
pharmacokinetics of naloxegol and the effect 
of the co-administration of naloxegol and 
quinidine on morphine-induced miosis in 
healthy volunteers. Co-administration of the 
P-gp inhibitor quinidine resulted in a 1.4 fold 
increase in the AUC (90% CI: 1.3-1.5) and a 
2.4 fold increase in the Cmax (90% CI: 
2.2-2.8) of naloxegol. Co-administration of 
naloxegol and quinidine did not antagonize the 
morphine-induced miosis effect, suggesting 
that P-gp inhibition does not meaningfully 
change the capacity of naloxegol to cross the 
blood-brain barrier at therapeutic doses. 
As the effects of P-gp inhibitors on the PK of 
naloxegol were small relative to the effects 
CYP3A4 inhibitors, the dosing 
recommendations for Moventig when 
co-administered with medicinal products 
causing both P-gp and CYP3A4 inhibition 
should be based on CYP3A4 inhibitor status - 
strong, moderate or weak - (see sections 4.2, 
4.3 and 4.5).  
Other dual P-gp and strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
include clarithromycin, telaprevir, ritonavir, 
and conivaptan.

statement:  
Rare cases of gastrointestinal perforation have 
been reported in the post-marketed use of 
peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor 
antagonists in patients with advanced medical 
illness. Caution with regards to the use of 
naloxegol should be exercised in patients with 
any condition which might result in impaired 
integrity of the gastrointestinal tract wall (e.g. 
severe peptic ulcer disease, Crohn’s Disease, 
active or recurrent diverticulitis, infiltrative 
gastrointestinal tract malignancies or 
peritoneal metastases). The overall 
benefit-risk profile for each patient should be 
taken into account. Patients are advised to 
discontinue therapy with naloxegol and 
promptly notify their physician if they develop 
unusually severe or persistent abdominal pain. 
SmPC Section 4.4(Special warnings and 
precautions for use) of the SmPC contains the 
following statement:  
None 
Patients with CV conditions 
Naloxegol was not studied in the clinical trial 
programme in patients who had a recent 
history of myocardial infarction within 
6 months, symptomatic congestive heart 
failure, overt cardiovascular (CV) disease or 
patients with a QT interval of ≥ 500msec. 
Moventig should be used with caution in these 
patients. A QTc study performed with 
naloxegol in healthy volunteers did not 
indicate any prolongation of the QT interval.

Concurrent methadone use 
Patients taking methadone as primary therapy 
for their pain condition were observed in 
clinical trials to have a higher frequency of 
gastrointestinal adverse events (such as 
abdominal pain and diarrhoea) than patients 
not receiving methadone. In a few cases, 
symptoms suggestive of opioid withdrawal 
when taking naloxegol 25 mg were observed 
in patients taking methadone for their pain 
condition. This was observed in a higher 
proportion of patients taking methadone than 
those not taking methadone. Patients taking 
methadone for treatment of opioid addiction 
were not included in the clinical development 
program and use of naloxegol in these 
patients should be approached with caution.

(<30 mL/min) 
(Pharmacodynamic properties):  
Long-term exposure to naloxegol 25 mg, up to 
52 weeks, was generally safe and well 
tolerated in the treatment of OIC patients with 
non-cancer-related pain.  During the 52-week 
treatment period there were no important 
unexpected differences in the safety and 
tolerability findings between the naloxegol 
25 mg treatment group and the usual care 
treatment group. 
SmPC Section 4.2:  
No dose adjustment is recommended based on 
age (see section 5.2). 
SmPC Section 5.2:  
There is a small effect of age on the 
pharmacokinetics of naloxegol (approximately 
0.7% increase in AUC for every year increase 
in age). No dose adjustment is recommended 
for elderly patients. Patients over 65 years of 
age have been represented in the phase III 
studies. Clinical studies of naloxegol did not 
include sufficient numbers of patients aged 75 
years or over to determine whether they 
respond differently than younger patients, 
however, based on the mode of action of the 
active substance there are no theoretical 
reasons for any requirement for dose 
adjustments in this age group. For dose 
recommendations for patients with moderate 
or severe renal insufficiency, see section 
4.2.There is no gender effect on the PK of 
naloxegol. 
SmPC Section 4.2:  
The starting dose for patients with moderate 
or severe renal insufficiency is 12.5 mg. If side 
effects impacting tolerability occur, naloxegol 
should be discontinued. The dose can be 
increased to 25 mg if 12.5 mg is well tolerated 
by the patient (see section 5.2). 
SmPC Section 5.2:  
As renal clearance is a minor route of 
elimination for naloxegol, regardless of

on the pharmacokinetics of naloxegol was 
minimal in most subjects. However, in 2 out of 
8 patients (in both the moderate and severe 
renal impairment groups but not in the end 
stage renal failure group) up to 10-fold 
increases in the exposure of naloxegol were 
observed. In these patients renal impairment 
may adversely affect other clearance 
pathways (hepatic/gut drug metabolism, etc.) 
resulting in higher exposure. Exposure of 
naloxegol in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) 
patients on hemodialysis was similar to 
healthy volunteers with normal renal function. 
SmPC Section 4.2:  
No dose adjustment is required for patients 
with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. 
Safety and efficacy have not been established 
in patients with severe hepatic impairment

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk minimisation 
measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication. 
The PRAC also considered that routine PhV is sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk 
minimisation measures. 
The CHMP endorses the final conclusions of the PRAC 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The appropriate guideline states that “Care should be taken that user testing is performed on the basis of 
the package leaflet as it is actually supplied with the product.” In this case, the user testing was 
performed on a leaflet reflecting the therapeutic indication originally applied for while only the use as a 
second line therapeutic indication, i.e. in OIC patients that respond inadequately to standard laxatives, 
can be approved. However, it is considered that the change in therapeutic indication will not substantially 
influence the outcome of user testing, which evaluates many more sections than the therapeutic 
indication only. In addition, a change in therapeutic indication does not necessitate a novel user 
consultation according to the corresponding guideline. The current user testing therefore can be 
considered sufficient. 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The major beneficial effect relates to the relief of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) assessed over a 
period of 12 weeks in non-cancer pain treated patients (primary study variable) in the subgroup of 
patients not responding adequately to standard laxatives (first key secondary endpoint, laxative 
inadequate responders (LIR) subgroup). In conjunction with this, improvement of constipation related 
symptoms and of quality of life data add clinical relevance to the treatment response detected.  
Using 25 mg naloxegol daily, a 42% and 48% efficacy response rate was demonstrated in the overall 
study population and in the LIR subgroup, respectively, compared to 30% in the placebo group and 35% 
in the non-LIR group after 12 weeks of treatment. Statistical significance was demonstrated for the 
treatment response rate in the overall study population and in the LIR subgroup compared to placebo. In 
addition, 95% CIs surrounding the point estimates of treatment effect size indicated a reliable, positive 
effect of treatment compared to placebo. Although these 95% CIs were fairly wide, it is important to 
notice that they did not straddle the "no effect" values, with the point estimate of effect being the best and 
most likely estimate of the true treatment effect in the population.  Similar positive results, even if 
borderline to significance, have been reported also for the 12.5 mg dose which can be considered as the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/738815/2014  
Page 114/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
starting dose for patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency or patients taking moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitors. The dose can be increased to 25 mg if 12.5 mg is well tolerated by the patient. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
The overall response of the primary endpoint in the overall study population was mainly driven by the 
response in the LIR subgroup indicating a consequently clinically irrelevant response size in the non-LIR 
subgroup. For this reason the initially proposed first line indication was narrowed to patients who have 
had an inadequate response to laxative(s) to reflect the population that can clinically benefit from the use 
of Naloxegol. 
Patient reported outcomes such as constipation symptom assessment reports (e.g. time to first laxation) 
and the PAC-SYM and PAC-QoL questionnaires' data were presented. Positive results in part of the 
domains scores analysed indicate positive effects in the use of Naloxegol. However, the clinical relevance 
of the PAC-QoL data is to be interpreted with caution as this questionnaire has not yet been validated in 
OIC patients.  
It is not anticipated that the method of action or the efficacy of the product will change in OIC patients 
with cancer-related pain. However, some of these patients may present with specific safety issues such as 
heightened risk of GI perforation, for which the product is contraindicated. Safety will be monitored 
closely in this patient population by means of a PASS study. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Increase in AEs 
During the 12-week efficacy studies, the incidences of AEs were 51.1%, 52.4% and 63.5% respectively in 
the placebo, NGL 12.5 mg and NGL 25 mg. This increased incidence of AEs was confirmed in these patient 
groups in the 24-week integrated dataset where the overall AE rates were 51.6%, 54.6%, and 64.7% and 
in the 52-week study with AEs incidences of 71.9% for the usual care group and 80.1% for the NGL 25 mg 
group. However, the product still presents with an appropriate tolerability profile since most of the AEs 
were mild to moderate in intensity. On the other hand, this increase in the prevalence of AEs, although 
being expected given naloxegol’s mechanism of action, is clearly higher compared to the usual care 
treatment which further supports the second line indication. 
Increase in GI AEs 
In all clinical trials, GI AEs are common and dose ordered. In the 25mg NGL group, the most common AEs 
are abdominal pain (15.9%), diarrhoea (9.2%), nausea (8.1%), flatulence (5.8%), vomiting (4.5%) and 
abdominal upper pain (3.8%). They tended to occur in the first weeks of treatment; however the 
prevalence of abdominal pain, flatulence and abdominal upper pain remains higher than placebo during 
the entire study. Moreover 3, 5 and 21 patients who received placebo, NGL 12.5 mg and NGL 25 mg 
respectively reported severe abdominal pain during the treatment period and a large part of these 
patients left the study. During the 52-week study, gastrointestinal AEs (abdominal pain, diarrhoea, 
nausea, flatulence, and abdominal upper pain) were still more common in the NGL 25 mg group compared 
with the usual care group. Most of these GI AEs remain also mild or moderate in intensity with a frequent 
onset in the first 7 days of treatment. As outlined in the SmPC consideration may be given to lowering the 
dose to 12.5mg in patients experiencing severe gastrointestinal adverse events depending upon the 
response and tolerability of individual patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/738815/2014  
Page 115/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Increase in DAEs 
Likewise, the overall DAE rate was clearly higher in the NGL 25 mg group (10.3%) compared to placebo 
(5.4%) or NGL 12.5 mg (4.8%). Most of the DAEs occurred during the first 4 weeks of treatment and were 
driven by GI AEs. These discontinuations are mostly due to diarrhoea (3.1%), abdominal pain (2.9%) and 
nausea  (1.1%).  During  the  long  term  study,  the  frequency  and  the  pattern  of  DAEs  were  similar. 
Moreover, in the 25 mg NGL group, 40.6% of the patients left the safety study (10.5% for DAEs) while 
only 30.7% left the placebo group. The relevant side effects are adequately taken into account in the 
SmPC where it is also outlined that patients should be advised to promptly report severe, persistent or 
worsening symptoms to their physician. 
Safety issues for patients treated concomitantly with methadone and high daily dose of opioids 
In the 12 weeks studies, over 80% of the patients treated with methadone and NGL 25mg had AEs, 
mostly GI AEs. In this specific population, approximately 25% of the patients will experience AEs under 
the NGL 25mg treatment that they would not have experienced under placebo treatment. An increase of 
AEs was also observed in the patients treated with opioid daily dose higher than 200 meus. The 
methadone-treated patients were excluded from the long term safety study. No interaction between 
methadone and NGL were detected during PK studies and this risk is considered balanced with 
appropriate precautionary statements within the SmPC. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Naloxegol is a peripherally acting selective antagonist of opioid binding at the mu-opioid receptor. 
Considering the fact that rare cases of gastrointestinal perforation have been reported in adult patients 
with the use of marketed peripherally acting mu-opioid receptor antagonists in patients with 
opioid-induced constipation, patients who were at risk of this AE were excluded from the clinical studies. 
Therefore, the risk of perforation for these patients treated with naloxegol was addressed with a 
contraindication in the SmPC. 
Patients taking methadone as primary therapy for their pain condition were observed in clinical trials to 
have a higher frequency of gastrointestinal adverse events (such as abdominal pain and diarrhoea) than 
patients not receiving methadone. In a few cases, symptoms suggestive of opioid withdrawal when taking 
naloxegol 25 mg were observed in patients taking methadone for their pain condition. This was observed 
in a higher proportion of patients taking methadone than those not taking methadone. As patients taking 
methadone for treatment of opioid addiction were not included in the clinical development program the 
SmPC includes a precautionary statement that use of naloxegol in these patients should be approached 
with caution. 
Patients with moderate or strong renal impairment and with hepatic impairment were also excluded from 
several phase IIb/III studies. Based on the pharmacokinetic profile of the product the starting dose for 
patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency or patients taking moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors should 
be 12.5 mg. The dose can be increased to 25 mg if 12.5 mg is well tolerated by the patient. 
Despite the fact that the reporting of CV AEs is reassuring, the safety profile of NGL in these patients 
needs to be completed because patients at high CV risks were not included in Phase III clinical studies 
(patients who had a QTcF >500 msec at screening, had a recent history of myocardial infarction within 6 
months before randomization, had symptomatic congestive heart failure, or had any other overt CV 
disease) ; for this purpose a PASS will be carried out as outlined in the risk management plan.

Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The primary study endpoint response rate is, on its own, insufficiently favourable in support of a 
marketing authorisation under the general indication as was originally submitted. The primary endpoint in 
the general population reached statistical significance, but the rather limited increase in response rate 
compared with placebo and the observed imbalance in response rate in two mutually exclusive 
subgroups, i.e. LIR and non-LIR patients, precluded the approval of the initial therapeutic indication 
based hereon. Unfavourable effects observed in the 25 mg naloxegol treatment arms of the phase III 
clinical trials were consistently higher compared to placebo. 
Consequently, the lack of balanced clinically relevant beneficial treatment effects results in a negative B/R 
balance in the general OIC patient population.  
Nevertheless efficacy results in the subgroup of patients, for which previous treatment with standard 
laxatives led to inadequate response, can be considered substantial and clinical relevant. They outweigh 
the risk of observed adverse events observed in this subgroup of OIC patients.

Benefit-risk balance 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The  efficacy  and  safety  of  naloxegol  was  mainly  established  in  two  replicate  phase  III  double  blind, 
placebo controlled studies in patients with OIC and non-cancer related pain. Other studies submitted were 
in support of the phase III efficacy and safety data. 
The efficacy of the product, in the two doses proposed by the applicant and in the general OIC patient 
population, was of borderline clinical significance when considered in the first line indication. Further to a 
more in-depth analysis of subgroups evidence of clinical relevance has been clearly obtained in the LIR 
population; indeed, assessment of subgroup data analysis indicates that Moventig up to 25mg daily 
demonstrates a larger and clinically relevant effect compared to placebo in LIR patients. This is also 
sustained by fairly positive results in the secondary endpoints analysed. This includes positive results in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/738815/2014  
Page 118/120 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the assessment of OIC symptoms even considering the validation limitation of the Patient Report 
Outcome questionnaire used. Therefore, general efficacy of the product has been demonstrated in the LIR 
subgroup with a dose up to 25mg. Due to the pharmacokinetic profile of the product the starting dose for 
patients with moderate to severe renal insufficiency or patients taking moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors should 
be 12.5 mg. The dose can be increased to 25 mg if 12.5 mg is well tolerated by the patient.  
The safety profile of the product has demonstrated a general acceptability of the drug in the target 
population of LIR patients. Most common AEs, as expected, are in the GI SOC, and therefore are mainly 
correlated with the mechanism of action of the drug and are dose related. As outlined in the SmPC, 
consideration may be given to lowering the dose from 25mg to 12.5mg in patients experiencing severe 
gastrointestinal adverse events depending upon the response and tolerability of individual patients. 
According to pain measurement, Naloxegol has also demonstrated no interference on opiod analgesic 
effect, confirming the absence of central antagonism of the µ-receptor and reassuring that opioid 
withdrawal symptoms are unlikely. Nevertheless the risk of opioid withdrawal cannot be totally excluded 
and is mentioned in the SmPC.  
Missing information on CV safety has been addressed in the RMP in which BP and syncope events have 
been listed as Important and Potential risks respectively and a PASS to characterize the CV risk and Major 
Adverse Cardiac Events such as MI, CVA, and cardiac death has been included in the Pharmacovigilance 
plan of the RMP. Missing information on cancer population should not reduce the possibility to consider 
the treatment in this subgroup of OIC patients. Indeed, it is not anticipated that the method of action or 
the efficacy of the product will change in OIC patients with cancer-related pain. However, some of these 
patients may present with high risk of GI perforation. Naloxegol is therefore contraindicated in these 
particular conditions. In addition safety will be monitored closely in this patient population and a PASS will 
be conducted as outlined in the risk management plan. 
In conclusion, considering the efficacy and safety profile of the product, the B/R of naloxegol 12.5 mg and 
25 mg daily for the treatment of opioid-induced constipation (OIC) in adult patients who have had an 
inadequate response to laxative(s) is considered to be positive.

to revise Section 4.8 of the EU Summary of Product 
the opportunity to update the PI in line with the QRD

Guideline on SmPC. Several tables of ADRs were mentioned 
in the section 4.8 of SmPC despite of similar indications of 
Caelyx and should have been merged in one table only. 
Additionally, some ADRs were listed standalone outside the 
tables in the document making the Section 4.8 unclear for 
healthcare professionals. Pooled analysis of the clinical 
trials data was used to establish the frequency of ADRs. All 
these issues have been resolved.

information).  
The requested variation proposed amendments to 
the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II, 
SmPC have been updated in order to include secondary oral 
neoplasms as an ADR and to include a recommendation for 
oral examinations to check for the presence of any oral 
ulceration or oral discomfort as a precaution. The Package

Update of section 4.8 of the SPC and Section 4 of the PL. 
Package Leaflet 
with information on cases of thrombophlebitis and venous 
thrombosis, as well as rare cases of pulmonary embolism. 
In summary, of 231 cases of venous thromboembolism in 
the MAH's Global Pharmacovigilance database, only 164 are 
considered confirmed cases. Of the 164 confirmed cases, 
the majority (i.e.134 cases) were not considered to be 
possibly or probably related to Caelyx treatment. 
Therefore, in only 30 confirmed cases was there sufficient 
evidence to assign a possible or probable causal association 
Page 21/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(possible causality in 28 and probable causality in 2). 
Notwithstanding the fact that it may not be easy to clearly 
show drug-specific causality in this application because of 
malignant disease and concomitant antineoplastic agents, 
the MAH's venous thromboembolism event rate for Caelyx 
still falls below the majority of the rates in similar 
malignant disease-specific populations the published 
literature. 
Because both DVT and PE are usually serious events, and 
PE carries a high fatality rate, the SPC is updated with the 
following statement: "In patients treated with Caelyx, cases 
of venous thromboembolism, including thrombophlebitis, 
venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism have been 
seen uncommonly.  However, because patients with cancer 
are at increased risk for thromboembolic disease, a causal 
relationship cannot be determined" based on the available 
information.

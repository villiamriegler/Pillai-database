Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) to submit within 2 
months a Type II variation to include dyspnoea as an 
adverse drug reaction in section 4.8 of the SPC. The basis 
for the CHMP request was the result of a review of clinical 
trials that was performed to elucidate the incidence rates of 
dyspnoea. The events were analysed by dose, seriousness 
and indication. Overall, the incidence rates of dyspnoea 
were higher in patients treated with memantine compared 
to those receiving placebo. No notable differences between 
treatments were found when considered all studies with 
Alzheimer's dementia indication.

The CHMP agreed that the Pharmacokinetic data obtained

once-daily dosing regimen.  
Five clinical studies in patients with AD supported the 
efficacy and safety assessment of the once-daily dosing 
regimen with memantine. In relation to efficacy results, no 
relevant differences were observed when AD patients were 
treated with memantine 20 mg once-daily with respect to 
patients treated with 10 mg twice-daily. In relation to the 
safety and tolerability both regimens showed similar safety 
profile.

In single-dose PK studies in young healthy subjects no 
relevant drug-drug interaction of memantine with 
glyburide/metformin or donepezil was observed and in a 
clinical study in young healthy subjects no relevant effect of 
memantine on the pharmacokinetics of galantamine was 
observed.

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
The results of the pharmacokinetic study suggest that 
moderate hepatic impairment does not alter the 
pharmacokinetics of memantine. In patients with moderate 
hepatic impaired function (Child-Pugh A and Child-Pugh B) 
no dosage adjustment is needed. No data on the use of 
memantine in patients with severe hepatic impairment are 
available. 
The product information was updated to reflect these 
results.

the influence of the renal impairment on the 
pharmacokinetic profile of memantine. The study showed 
that: 
The exposure of patients with mild renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance 50 - 80 ml/min) is comparable to the 
exposure in healthy subjects. No dosage adjustment is 
required in these patients.  
The extent of exposure in patients with moderate renal 
impairment (creatinine clearance 30   49 ml/min) is about 
60% higher than the extent of exposure of healthy 
subjects. In these patients the daily dose should be 
reduced to 10 mg per day. If tolerated well after at least 7 
days of treatment, the dose could be increased up to 20 
mg/day according to standard titration scheme.  
The exposure in patients with severe renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance 5 - 29 ml/min) is about 100% higher 
than in healthy subjects. In these patients the daily dose 
should be 10 mg per day.

Section 4.5 of the SPC has been updated in relation

SPC regarding pancreatitis, depression, suicidal 
ideation, suicide and psychotic reactions. Relevant 
sections of the PL was amended accordingly. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
have been updated in relation to interactions with warfarin. 
Close monitoring of prothrombin time or INR in patients 
treated concomitantly with oral anticoagulants was advised 
which is also reflected in the SPC.  
Following PSUR 6, the MAH performed also a re-analysis of 
each individual case report with pancreatitis reported either 
through the spontaneous reporting system or in clinical 
trials. It was concluded that isolated cases of pancreatitis 
had been observed in post-marketing experience. 
Alzheimer's disease, has been associated with psychotic 
reactions, depression, suicidal ideation and suicide. 
Although confounding factors cannot be excluded, these 
events have been reported in patients treated with

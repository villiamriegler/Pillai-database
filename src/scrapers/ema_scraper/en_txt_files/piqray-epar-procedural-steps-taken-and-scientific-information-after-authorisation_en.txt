to update drug-drug interaction information, based 
II and PL 
No dose adjustment is required when co administering 
on final results from study BYL719A2111; this is a 
phase 1, open-label, fixed-sequence, two-period 
drug-drug interaction (DDI) study evaluating the PK 
probe substrates for CYP3A4, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 when administered either 
alone or in combination with repeated doses of 
Piqray with CYP3A4 substrates (e.g. everolimus, 
midazolam), CYP2C8 substrates (e.g. repaglinide), CYP2C9 
substrates (e.g. warfarin), CYP2C19 substrates (e.g. 
omeprazole). For CYP2B6 substrate, no relevant changes in 
the exposure were observed when co-administered with 
Piqray however the results should be considered with 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Metabolic interaction 
CYP3A4, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP2B6 
substrates 
In a drug-drug interaction study, co administration of 
repeated doses of alpelisib 300 mg with a single dose of 
sensitive substrates of CYP3A4 (midazolam), CYP2C8 
(repaglinide), CYP2C9 (warfarin), CYP2C19 (omeprazole) 
and CYP2B6 (bupropion), administered as a cocktail, 
showed that there is no clinically signficant pharmacokinetic 
interaction. The data from CYP2B6 substrate (bupropion) 
should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample 
size. 
In healthy subjects, co administration of a CYP2C9 
substrate (S-warfarin) with repeated doses of 300 mg 
alpelisib at steady state, increased S warfarin exposure on 
average by 34% and 19% for AUCinf and Cmax 
respectively, compared to administration of S warfarin 
alone. This indicates that alpesilib is a mild inhibitor of 
CYP2C9.

CYP3A4 inducer) for 7 days followed by co administration 
with a single 300 mg oral dose of alpelisib on day 8, 
decreased alpelisib Cmax by 38% and AUC by 57% in 
healthy adults (N=25). Co-administration of rifampin 600 
mg once daily for 15 days with alpelisib 300 mg once daily 
starting from day 8 to day 15 decreased the steady state 
alpelisib Cmax by 59% and AUC by 74%. 
Co-administration with a strong CYP3A4 inducer decreases 
alpelisib AUC, which may reduce alpelisib efficacy. Co-
administration of alpelisib with strong CYP3A4 inducers 
(e.g. apalutamide, carbamazepine, enzalutamide, mitotane, 
phenytoin, rifampin, St. John’s wort) should be avoided and 
selection of an alternative concomitant medicinal product, 
with no or minimal potential to induce CYP3A4, should be 
considered.

Summary 
SmPC new text 
The study met its primary objective at the final PFS 
analysis (cut off date 12 Jun 2018), demonstrating a 
statistically significant improvement in PFS per investigator 
assessment in the PIK3CA mutant cohort for patients 
receiving alpelisib plus fulvestrant, compared to patients 
receiving placebo plus fulvestrant with an estimated 35% 
risk reduction of disease progression or death in favour of 
treatment with alpelisib plus fulvestrant. 
At the time when the final OS analysis was conducted (data 
cut off date of 23 Apr 2020) a descriptive follow-up efficacy 
analysis for PFS data was performed. With a median 
duration from randomisation to data cut off of 
approximately 42 months, the reported PFS results were 
Page 6/9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
consistent with those from the primary PFS analysis. There 
was an estimated 36% risk reduction of progression or 
death in favour of treatment with alpelisib plus fulvestrant 
(HR=0.64; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.81) 
At the final OS analysis, the study did not meet its key 
secondary objective. As of the data cut off date of 23 Apr 
2020, a total of 87 (51.5%) deaths were reported in the 
alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm and 94 (54.7%) in the 
placebo plus fulvestrant arm. The HR was 0.86 (95% CI: 
0.64, 1.15; p=0.15, one sided) and the pre specified 
O’Brien Fleming efficacy boundary of p ≤0.0161 was not 
crossed. Median OS was 39.3 months (95% CI: 34.1, 44.9) 
in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm and 31.4 months (95% 
CI: 26.8, 41.3) in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm. 
In patients with prior CDK4/6i treatment (n=20), the 
median OS in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm was 29.8 
months (95% CI: 6.7, 38.2) compared to 12.9 months 
(95% CI: 2.5, 34.6) in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm 
(HR=0.67; 95% CI: 0.21, 2.18).

1.  Introduction 
On 16 October 2018, the MAH submitted data available from a patient less than 18 years of age, 
recruited in study P13-684, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as 
amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion  
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study P13-684 Assessment of clinical effectiveness and safety of adalimumab and 
high dose methotrexate in routine clinical practice is a stand alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The pharmaceutical formulation of Humira was 40 mg for subcutaneous administration. 290 of 300 
patients in the safety analysis administered 40 mg every other week.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In Japan, Humira at 40 mg and 80 mg was approved on April 16, 2008 and launched in the market on 
June 18, 2008. The results of a recent retrospective data analysis of the all-patient prescribed Humira 
study of Japanese patients with RA suggested that the effectiveness of adalimumab in bio-naïve 
patients with RA was more efficacious when they receive adalimumab in combination with MTX at a 
dose of ≥10 mg/week. A prospective non-interventional study of ADA + MTX ≥12 mg/week in patients 
with early (≤2 years) RA without previous biological treatment was performed, in order to assess the 
effectiveness and safety in daily routine practice. Data available from patients less than 18 years of 
age was submitted.  
The MAH submitted a final report for:

Clinical study number and title 
Study P13-684 Assessment of clinical effectiveness and safety of adalimumab and high dose 
methotrexate in routine clinical practice. 
Description 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The primary objective was to assess the clinical effectiveness of adalimumab in combination with high 
dose MTX (≥12 mg/week) by assessing the percentage of patients with the DAS28 score of <2.6 at 
week 52. 
The secondary objective was to assess the clinical effectiveness of adalimumab in combination with 
high dose MTX (≥12 mg/week) by assessing the proportion of patients with a change in the following 
variables from baseline to week 104: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) 
Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) 
The severity of functional impairment (HAQ) 
The health-related quality of life (EQ-5D) 
The inhibition of structural progression will be assessed by measuring the modified van der 
Heijde Total Sharp Score (mTSS). 
Study design 
This was a single-arm, multi-center, open labelled and prospective cohort study (post marketing 
observational study). 
In daily clinical setting, patients with RA who receive adalimumab (Humira) and high-dose MTX (≥12 
mg/week) was observed prospectively and the effectiveness was assessed by DAS28, HAQ and mTSS, 
In addition the safety the safety profile was assessed by measuring all serious adverse events (SAEs) 
and adverse events (AEs). 
The observation period was 104 weeks. 
Study population /Sample size 
350 subjects; Adult subjects (≥16 years) with early (≤2 years) RA without previous biological 
treatment, who received adalimumab in combination with MTX ≥12 mg/week. 
Inclusion criteria 
The subjects of this study are patients with a diagnosis of RA and to whom adalimumab is prescribed 
as part of their normal treatment of RA. All subjects were to fulfil the following:

Disease duration of RA ≤2 years 
MTX administration ≥3 months prior to starting adalimumab 
Dose of MTX ≥12mg/week 
DAS28-CRP >3.2 
Exclusion criterion 
Patients who have been previously treated with biologics (including other TNF inhibitors) 
Treatments 
Humira sc in accordance to the Japanese label, 96.7% received 40mg eow. 
Statistical Methods 
This was an observational study; therefore, the analyses were primarily involved the generation of 
descriptive summary statistics. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed and baseline data 
There were 346 subjects enrolled at 128 sites. The number of subjects in the safety analysis set was 
300, and the number of subjects in the efficacy analysis set was 292. Age (Mean ± SD) of subjects in 
the safety analysis set was 54.1 ± 13.9 years, and 73.7% (221/300) were females. 
Efficacy results 
The remission rate was 71.2% (208/292) in the last observation. The remission rate at week 52 was 
77.1%（162/210）in the subjects with available data set to calculate DAS28 score. Out of 292 subjects 
in the efficacy analysis set 210 subjects had an available data set that permitted calculation of DAS28 
score at this time point. The remission rate at week 104 was 92.3% DAS28-4 (120/130) in the 130 
subjects with available data set permitting assessment of the DAS28 score.  
Differences were also observed throughout the entire assessment period from 4 weeks to 104 weeks 
after start of treatment regarding change in DAS28-4CRP, DAS28-ESR scores, CDAI, SDAI and HAQ 
and EQ-5D-3L. The change of mTSS at week 52 was ≤ 0.5 in 86% (135/157) of the subjects remaining 
in the study at this time point. At week 104, a change in mTSS of ≤ 0.5 was reported for 74.3% 
(52/70) of the remaining subjects. 
Safety results 
No deaths were reported in this study. 226 adverse events were observed in 124 patients out of 300 
patients in the safety analysis set, and the incidence rate of adverse events was thus 
41.33%(124/300). 35 serious adverse events were observed in 29 patients, and the incidence rate of 
serious adverse events was thus 9.67% (29/300). 
Paediatric Data  
One paediatric subject participated in this study. The subject was a 16 year-old female who received 
Humira for 393 days and did not report any adverse event.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
MAH’s discussion 
Adalimumab in combination with high dose MTX improved the signs and symptoms of Japanese 
subjects with rheumatoid arthritis during 104 weeks of treatment as measured by DAS28, CDAI, SDAI, 
HAQ, EQ-5D-3L and suppressed the bone destruction during 104 weeks of treatment measured by 
mTSS. The safety findings were consistent with the known and described safety profile of adalimumab. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation  
Overall conclusion 
The MAH has provided results from a post marketing observational study (P13-684), designed as a 
single-arm, multi-center, open labelled prospective cohort study. It was conducted in Japan, in order to 
investigate the effectiveness and safety in patients with early (≤2 years) RA without previous biological 
treatment, who received adalimumab in combination with MTX ≥12 mg/week. 
At baseline, disease activity was high in 71 subjects (24.3%) and moderate in 221 subjects (75.7%). 
At week 52, DAS28-4CRP remission was achieved in 162/210 subjects (77.1%), and at week 104, in 
120/130 subjects (92.3%). 
Improvement was also shown for all secondary efficacy variables, which were DAS28-4CRP, DAS28-
ESR scores as well as change of CDAI, SDAI, HAQ, EQ-5D-3L and the change of mTSS after 104 
weeks. The safety results did not raise any new concerns. A full assessment of the results from the 
adult study has not been made since it is out scope for this submission. 
Among the included subjects was a 16 year old female, who received Humira for 393 days, without 
reporting any adverse events. No efficacy data has been provided for this subject, however the scope 
for P46 submissions is mainly safety, and no additional information is therefore currently requested. 
No data that changes the B/R balance of the product or warrants changes to the PI or RMP regarding 
the use in children has been identified. No further actions are required. 
Recommendation 
  Fulfilled  
No regulatory action required.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Zonegran  contains  zonisamide,  a  well-know  anti-epileptic  agent.  It  has  been  authorised  in  the  EU  in 
2005 for the indication adjunctive therapy in the treatment of adult patients with partial seizures, with 
or without secondary generalisation. 
The  mechanism  of  action  of  zonisamide  is  not  fully  elucidated.  Zonisamide  appears  to  act  on 
voltage-sensitive  sodium  and  calcium  channels,  thereby  disrupting  synchronised  neuronal  firing, 
reducing the spread of seizure discharges and disrupting subsequent epileptic activity. Zonisamide also 
has a modulatory effect on GABA-mediated neuronal inhibition. 
The staring does is 50 mg in two divided doses. After one week the dose may be increased to 100 mg 
daily. Thereafter, the dose may be increased at weekly intervals in increments of up to 100 mg. Doses 
of 300 mg to 500 mg per day have been shown to be effective in the add-on setting. Once the dose is 
established, zonisamide can be administered once or twice daily. 
At  present  there  are  4  antiepileptic  agents  used  in  monotherapy.  The  most  commonly  used 
antiepileptics in monotherapy are carbamazepine and valproate. The first choice monotherapy drug for 
partial  epilepsy  is  carbamazepine,  which  accounts  for  over  60%  of  prescriptions.  However  in  a 
proportion of patients, usage of these established treatments may be limited by unwanted side effects, 
pharmacokinetic interactions, multiple doses each day and/or lack of efficacy. The addition of another 
monotherapy agent could be useful.  
Zonisamide is  generally well  tolerated  with  the  potential  for  titration without  some  of  the  side  effects 
observed  with  current  first  line  therapy  treatments.  Furthermore,  zonisamide  has  a  pharmacokinetic 
profile, with a long half-life, permitting once daily dosing. 
The current variation concerns the extension of the indication to monotherapy i.e. 
“Monotherapy in the treatment of newly diagnosed epilepsy in adults affected by partial seizures with 
or without secondary generalization.”

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An environmental risk assessment was first conducted for zonisamide in April 2003, in support of the 
Marketing Authorisation Application for Zonegran Hard Capsules. 
A new environmental risk assessment was conducted in December 2008 to include the use of Zonegran 
Orodispersible  Tablets  (25  mg,  50  mg,  100  mg,  and  300  mg).  However,  it  was  later  updated  as 
requested  by  CHMP  with  the  results  of  the  Phase  II  Tier  A  studies  using  zonisamide,  together  with  a 
comprehensive  justification  (including  published  epidemiological  data)  for  the  refined  market 
penetration (Fpen). 
Zonegran  Hard  Capsules  (25  mg,  50  mg,  100  mg)  and  Zonegran  Orodispersible  Tablets  (25  mg,  50 
mg,  100  mg,  300  mg)  are  currently  indicated  as  adjunctive  therapy  in  the  treatment  of  partial 
seizures,  with  or  without  secondary  generalisation,  in  adults.  An  updated  environmental  risk 
assessment has been submitted with this application encompassing environmental exposure due to the 
current  authorised  indication  and  environmental  exposure  due  to  the  planned  extensions  to  the 
indication to include adjunctive use in paediatric patients (aged 6 years and above) and monotherapy 
in newly diagnosed adult patients. 
The projected PEC surfacewater is 0.5 μg/L, based on the assumption of 100% market share and a refined 
market  penetration  (Fpen)  value  of  0.002.  This  worst-case  refined  (Fpen)  value  has  been  calculated 
using the highest epidemiologically-based prevalence value (0.5%) in Europe for the indication for all 
paediatric ages and adult patients combined. 
Since  using  the  worst-case  refined  Fpen  based  on  the  prevalence  (as  stipulated  in  the  Questions  and 
Answers  document  (EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010),  the  PEC surfacewater  default  value  of  0.01  g/L  as 
outlined in the NfG on Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (Doc. Ref. 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) has been exceeded (PEC = 1.25 g/L), a Phase II environmental fate and 
effect analysis should be performed. 
A  comprehensive  Phase  II  Tier  A  environmental  fate  and  effects  analysis  was  performed  for 
zonisamide, showing that for projected PEC SURFACEWATER values of 0.5 μg/L (based on the assumption of 
100%  market  share  and  highest  prevalence  rate  for  the  indication),  the  environmental  risk  from 
exposure to zonisamide is negligible. 
Zonisamide is well absorbed and excreted primarily in the urine as parent drug and metabolised drug. 
The major human metabolites have been shown to be pharmacodynamically inactive. 
The  adsorption  coefficient  (Koc)  values  of  zonisamide  in  various  matrices  (soil,  sediment)  are  low 
indicating  high  to  very  high  mobility,  such  that  an  environmental  assessment  in  the  terrestrial 
compartment  is  not  necessary.  No  results  on  adsorption  to  sludge  were  reported.  The  log  Kow  (n-
octanol/water partition coefficient) of zonisamide is low (0.510), such that there is negligible potential 
for bioaccumulation. 
Given  the  high  mobility  and  low  bioaccumulation  as  indicated  by  the  very  low  log  Kow,  the  CHMP 
considered the decision for not perform terrestrial compartment acceptable. 
Zonisamide  exhibits  a  spectral  absorption  in  the  range  of  239  to  283  nm,  which  is  within  the  solar 
ultraviolet  (UV)  range,  and  therefore  it  would  be  expected  to  undergo  photodegradation  in  aqueous 
environments.  An  aqueous  photodegradation  study  was  performed,  showing  that  zonisamide  rapidly 
undergoes  photodegradation  over  a  range  of  pH  values,  with  experimentally  determined  half-lives  of 
2.70, 1.78 and 1.37 hours for pH values of 5, 7 and 9 respectively. Based on the short half-lives (less

than  three  hours),  the  MAH  stipulated  that  photodegradation  is  a  major  removal  pathway  for 
zonisamide in wastewater treatment plants and other aqueous environmental compartments 
The  CHMP  however  did  not  agree  that  the  elimination/removal  in  wastewater  treatment  plants  and 
other  aqueous  environmental  compartments  was  plausible  due  to  the  observed  photodegradation.  In 
wastewater  treatment  plants  water  is  not  clear  and  therefore  there  is  insufficient  sunlight.  From 
toxicity tests in clear water zonisamide was hardly degraded after 2-3 days. 
In  a  GLP-compliant  aerobic  degradation  study  (OECD  Guideline  308)  in  two  non-contaminated 
water/sediment  systems  (GV  =  nutrient  poor  system  with  low  potential  for  degradation;  SW  =  small 
pond  with  higher  organic  content),  zonisamide  only  partially  dissipated  from  the  water  layer  to  the 
sediment layer with <10% zonisamide present in the sediment at and after 14 days. In both the water 
and sediment layer, zonisamide gradually degraded. Degradation products (metabolites) were found in 
both GV and SW systems. In the GV system, two relevant metabolite fractions (Met 1 and Met 3) and 
in  the  SW  system  four  relevant  metabolite  fractions  (Met  1,  Met  2,  Met  3  and  Met  4)  were  detected. 
Met 1 was probably a degradation product of the other metabolites. The DT50 values for zonisamide in 
water, sediment and total system were 4 to 14 days, 4 to 21 days and 4 to 17 days respectively in SW 
and GV systems, with the lower DT50 values of 4 days observed in the SW system as expected. The 
total system DT50 values for the metabolites in the water/sediment systems were 9 to 30 days. 
The  CHMP  noted  that  the  data  from  the  degradation  study  suggests  that  zonisamide  only  partially 
dissipated  from  the  water  layer  to  the  sediment  layer  and  gradually  degraded  in  both  layers.  DT50 
were  determined  and  amounted  to  between  4-21  days  for  parent  compound  and  9-30  days  for 
metabolites. Since more than 10% of the radioactivity was present in sediment at the end of the study 
(21% and 17% as bound residue in GV and SW sediments, respectively), the MAH is recommended to 
perform a toxicity study on a sediment dwelling organism (Hyalella sp; Lumbriculus sp. or Chironomus 
sp.) and compare this to the PECsediment. 
An aquatic risk assessment, based on long-term toxicity data as well as acute toxicity test results, has 
demonstrated that the aquatic risk from zonisamide to surface water and ground water compartments 
and  to  microorganisms  is  negligible.  Findings  from  long-term  aquatic  toxicity  studies  showed  that 
zonisamide was non-toxic at 10 mg/L in fish and Daphnia (only one concentration tested) and at 100 
mg/L  in  algae.  The  derived  PEC/PNEC  ratios  were  very  low  (≤0.0005)  using  the  higher 
epidemiologically-based projection of PEC surfacewater (0.5 μg/L). 
The  CHMP  noted  that  PEC surfacewater:  PNEC microorganism  ratio  was  below  0.1,  thus  according  to  the 
for  Human  Use” 
“Guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  of  Medicinal  Products 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00),  no  further  evaluation  of  the  fate  and  effects  of  the  drug  substance  on 
micro-organisms are required. 
The  MAH  concludes  that  no  environmental  risk is  presented  by  zonisamide  from  the  use  of  Zonegran 
Hard Capsules (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg) and Zonegran Orodispersible Tablets (25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg, 
300 mg), taking into account the indication as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of partial seizures, 
with  or  without  secondary  generalisation,  in  adults  and  the  extension  of  the  indication  to  include 
adjunctive  use  in  paediatric  patients  (aged  6  years  and  above)  and  monotherapy  in  newly  diagnosed 
adult patients. 
The  conclusion  of  the  completed  Phase  II  environmental  risk  assessments  for  zonisamide  was 
supported  by  CHMP.  The  extension  of  the  indication  to  include  adjunctive  use  in  paediatric  patients 
(aged  6  years  and  above)  and  monotherapy  in  newly  diagnosed  adult  patients  and  thus  increase  the 
overall environmental exposure is not thought to impact on the environmental risk.

However, the risk assessment to the sediment compartment cannot be concluded and the MAH was 
recommended to perform a toxicity test on a sediment dwelling organism in the first RSI. 
In their answer, the MAH argued that such study was not necessary, taking into account the extremely 
large safety factor of more than 35,700 and the following factors: 
 
The NOEC of 10 mg/L (only dose tested) in a fathead minnow fish early-life stage test was the 
same as the NOEC (only dose tested)  in the Daphnia magna 21-day reproduction test, showing 
that zonisamide is of low toxicity and that comparable lack of toxicity has been seen in these two 
aquatic species.  As shown in the ERA for Zonegran (Zonisamide), the NOECs for fresh water algae 
and for activated sludge respiration inhibition were >100 mg/L also demonstrating extremely low 
inter-species toxicities. 
 
It can therefore be assumed that sediment dwelling organisms including Hyalella sp., Lumbriculus 
sp. and Chironomus sp. will not show markedly different toxicity to zonisamide and that a very 
large safety factor over the PECSEDIMENT will exist for sediment dwelling organisms. 
  Hyalella sp., Lumbriculus sp. or Chironomus sp. would have to be many times more sensitive 
toxicologically than the fathead minnow or Daphnia magna in order to trigger a requirement for 
further evaluation of the sediment compartment. 
  Since the NOEC of 10 mg/L used for the calculation of PNEC SEDIMENT was the only dose tested, the 
true NOEC is in fact greater than 10 mg/L, such that the safety margin is actually greater than 
35,700. 
 
The major human metabolites of zonisamide have been shown to be pharmacodynamically 
inactive, as outlined in the ERA for Zonegran (Zonisamide). 
  Zonisamide has high mobility and low bioaccumulation potential, as outlined in the ERA for 
Zonegran (Zonisamide). 
Even if sediment dwelling organisms were more toxicologically sensitive compared to other species and 
a higher assessment factor (100 or 1000 rather than 10) was used, the sediment compartment risk 
would remain extremely low and the PNECSEDIMENT would be orders of magnitude lower than PECSEDIMENT 
(>3570 or >357, respectively). 
The CHMP considered that the algae test did not fulfill the validity criteria according to OECD 201. The 
algae did not grow in the first 24 h, as the test was conducted in the dark for the first 24 h. This is 
inacceptable. The MAH argued that the active ingredient is photolytic not stable and would be 
degraded, but the concentration was stable during the entire test, even after the illumination was 
started after 24 hours. 
The data from the water/sediment-degradation study suggests that more than 10% of the radioactivity 
is present in sediment at the end of the study (active ingredient plus non extractable residues). Hence, 
the CHMP maintained its position that a study on sediment dwelling organisms (preferably with 
Lumbriculus variegatus) should be performed to evaluate the potential risk to sediment organisms. 
2.3.2.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in the application. 
The  MAH  has  provided  a  revised  ERA  including  a  Phase  I  with  calculation  of  a  PECsurfacewater  and 
additional studies for a Phase II assessment.

With  regards  to  the  CHMP  request  to  perform  a  toxicity  test  on  a  sediment  dwelling  organism,  the 
CHMP acknowledged the MAH’s response and equilbrium partitioning calculations presented. However, 
when  both  PEC  and  PNEC  are  converted  to  a  corresponding  sediment  concentration  using  the  same 
equations  and  sorption  constant,  the  PEC/PNEC  ratio  remains  equal.  Hence,  the  PEC/PNEC  ratio  for 
water of 0.0005 also applies to sediment. 
The MAH is therefore recommended to provide a valid algae growth inhibition test and a study on 
sediment dwelling organisms: the wording of section 6.6, Special precautions for disposal, is amended 
to “Any unused medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local 
requirements” until the evaluation of the study results warrants otherwise. 
2.4.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
Four studies were submitted:

2.4.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
One  clinical  pharmacology  study,  study  108,  is  included  in  this  submission.  This  study  evaluated  the 
effect  of  race  on  single-dose  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of  zonisamide  in  healthy  White,  Black,  and  Asian 
subjects.  The  results  of  the  study  showed  that  the  pharmacokinetics  of  zonisamide  (100  mg  single 
dose) are not influenced by race. 
The  CHMP  agreed  with  these  conclusions.  Cmax  was  marginally  higher  in  Asians  and  African 
descendants  compared  to  Caucasian,  but  as  zonisamide  is  gradually  titrated  based  on  individual 
response, it is not expected that this marginal difference will be of clinical relevance. 
2.4.2.  Clinical efficacy 
To support the clinical efficacy of the monotherapy claim two studies were submitted: the dose finding 
study (AN46046-304) and the pivotal phase III randomised controlled trial (E2090-E-44-310). 
Dose-response study: AN46046-304 
Study  304  was  a  Phase  3,  multicenter,  double-blind,  randomized  study  in  169  adult  subjects  with 
newly  diagnosed  epilepsy  and  complex  partial  seizures,  conducted  to  evaluate  3  dose  levels  of  ZNS 
(25, 100, and 300 mg/d) as monotherapy in adult subjects with newly diagnosed epilepsy and complex 
partial  seizures.  The  study  was  conducted  in  34  centres  between  20  February  2002  and  20  October 
2004 in the US, Europe, and Mexico. A new diagnosis of epilepsy meant a subject for whom this was 
the  first  diagnosis  of  epilepsy,  or  a  subject  who  had  a  previous  diagnosis  of  epilepsy  but  had  not 
received AED therapy for that previous diagnosis for at least 2 years. 
The initial zonisamide dose was 25 mg/day or 50 mg/day. Patients in the 100- and 300-mg/day group 
were up-titrated with 50 mg weekly until the target dose was reached. If a subject could not achieve 
the target dose because of tolerability issues, the subject was discontinued from the study. 
The efficacy evaluation period was the double-blind titration and treatment phase of 40 weeks. 
Primary endpoint was the time to exit, defined as time from first dose of study drug to exit from study 
due  to  occurrence  of  two  complex  partial  seizures  or  one  generalized  tonic-clonic  seizure.  Secondary 
endpoints concerned the proportion of subjects seizure-free for at least 6 months and the proportion of 
subjects remaining on treatment for the duration of the study. 
The  primary  efficacy  analysis  and  the  secondary  efficacy  analysis  of  6  month-seizure  freedom  were 
performed on the safety population (all those randomised who received at least one dose of the study 
drug). The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the study.

Table 2.  Time to Predefined Exit Criterion (2 Complex Partial Seizures or 1 Generalized Tonic-Clonic 
Seizure) (Safety Population) 
The percentage of subjects who reached a predefined exit criterion was lower in the 300-mg/day group 
(22.0%)  than  in  the  25-  and  100-mg/day  groups  (41.1%  and  40.4%,  respectively).  However,  this 
difference  was  not  statistically  significant  in  the  safety  population.  This  raises  the  possibility  that  the 
study was underpowered, although there was a trend (p value 0.060).   
CI = confidence interval; NE = not estimable. 
a Results are based on the Kaplan-Meier method. 
b The risk ratio, 95% CI for risk ratio, and p-value are based on Cox proportional hazards regression 
model under the assumption that the dosing groups were equally spaced. 
Table 3.  Proportion of Subjects Seizure-Free for at Least 6 Months (Safety Population) 
The percentage of subjects who remained seizure-free for at least 6 months was higher in the 300- 
mg/day group (50.8%) than in the 25- and 100-mg/day groups (33.9% and 30.8%, respectively). 
However, these differences were not statistically significant (p=0.061). The difference seems to apply 
only to those subjects with a history of generalized tonic-clonic seizures, for whom the proportion of 
subjects seizure-free for at least 6 months was 60.0% in the 300-mg/day group, as compared to 
30.8% and 33.3% in the 25- and 100-mg/day groups, respectively. There was essentially no difference 
across treatment groups in those with a history of complex partial seizures.

Table 4.  Proportion of Subjects Remaining on Treatment for the Duration of the Study (Safety 
Population) 
The proportion of subjects who remained on treatment for the duration of the study was similar in all 
treatment groups: 41.1% in the 25-mg/day group, 40.4% in the 100-mg/day group, and 40.7% in the 
300-mg/day group. 
a The p-value for trend is based on the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel statistic under the assumption that the dosing groups were equally spaced. 
b The p-value for treatment comparisons is based on the Pearson’s Chi square statistic. 
The proportion reaching an exit criterion was lowest for the 300mg dose (22% v 40.4% for the 100mg 
dose  and  41.1%  for  the  25mg  dose).  However  these  differences  were  not  statistically  significant. 
Results  for  the  25  mg  and  100mg  group  are  almost  the  same.  In  addition,  it  appears  that  a  higher 
percentage of women met an exit criterion in all 3 treatment groups. 
 The proportion of subjects seizure-free for at least 6 months was the highest in the 300mg treatment 
group  (50.8%  v  33.3%  for  the  100mg  group  and  30.8%  for  the  25mg  group).  Again  this  difference 
was  not  statistically  significant.  Even  though  statistical  significance  was  not  achieved  for  6  month 
seizure freedom it is clear that results in the 300mg group are considerably higher than those for the 
100mg and 25 mg groups which are broadly similar. 
There  was  no  difference  in  outcome  for  6  month  seizure  freedom  in  those  with  a  history  of  complex 
partial seizures. 
Withdrawals  for  any  reason  were  the  highest  for  the  300mg  group.  This  study  also  showed  a  higher 
proportion  of  females  meeting  an  exit  criterion,  however  modelling  the  effect  of  gender  showed  no 
evidence of a gender treatment interaction and the CHMP concluded that the response to ZNS does not 
seem to be affected by gender. 
Despite  not  showing  statistical  significance  when  compared  to  25mg  or  100mg  doses  a  monotherapy 
dose of 300mg appears reasonable given that lower rates for achieving an exit criterion and higher 6 
month  seizure  free  rates  were  associated  with  the  300mg  dose  and  that  doses  of  300  to  500mg  are 
already approved for Zonegran in the adjunctive setting. 
Main clinical study: E2090-E-44-310 
Study  310  was  a  Phase  III,  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  non-inferiority  study  comparing 
zonisamide (ZNS) against Tegretol Retard (a prolonged release formulation of carbamazepine, referred 
to  as  CBZ  in  this  document),  using  a  flexible  dosing  regimen.  The  study  was  conducted  in  583  adult 
subjects with newly diagnosed partial onset seizures with or without secondary generalized tonic-clonic 
Assessment report

seizures,  in  Europe,  South  Africa,  Australia,  and  Asia.  Subjects  were  randomized  to  a  target  dose  of 
CBZ 600 to 1200 mg/d (twice daily) or ZNS 300 to 500 mg/d once daily, and received treatment for up 
to  24  months,  depending  on  response.  During  the  Flexible  Dosing  Period,  one  down-titration  step  to 
200 mg/d ZNS or 400 mg/d CBZ was permitted in case of intolerability. 
The primary objective was to assess the efficacy of ZNS compared to CBZ when given as monotherapy 
to newly diagnosed subjects with partial seizures by assessment of 26-week seizure free rate. 
Secondary  objectives  included  assessment  of  the  efficacy  of  ZNS  compared  to  CBZat  one  year 
assessment of safety and tolerability of ZNS compared to CBZ and assessment of the quality of life of 
subjects taking ZNS compared to CBZ. 
Figure 1.  The study phases with dosage schedule 
During the Titration Period, the starting dose was 100 mg/day ZNS or 200 mg/day CBZ. The dose was 
increased every 2 weeks until a dose of 300 mg/day ZNS or 600 mg/day CBZ was reached. 
Subjects  who  were  unable  to  achieve  the  target  dose  of  300  mg/day  ZNS  or  600  mg/day  CBZ  were 
either withdrawn or in case of intolerance permitted one down-titration step during the first 2 weeks of 
the  flexible  dosing  period  (FDP).  If  subjects  consequently  experienced  a  seizure,  their  dose  could  be 
up-titrated  provided  their  AE  had  resolved.  A  maximum  of  two  up-titrations  were  allowed  for  these 
subjects up to a maximum dose of 400 mg/day ZNS or 800 mg/day CBZ. 
During the FDP the need for up- or down-titration was evaluated based on the occurrence of seizures 
and  adverse  events.  Subjects  could  be  withdrawn  from  the  study  if  they  experienced  seizures  during 
the FDP. 
Subjects who were seizure-free for 26 weeks in the FDP entered the maintenance period and continued 
on a stable dose for a further 26 weeks. Subjects who experienced a seizure during the maintenance 
period were withdrawn from the study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/345694/2012  
Page 11/34
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subjects  who  completed  the  study  (seizure-free  for  26  weeks  during  the  Maintenance  Period)  could 
continue ZNS/CBZ treatment in extension study or were withdrawn from the study. Study medication 
was down-titrated at a rate of 100 mg/week ZNS or 200 mg/week CBZ. 
Endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of subjects seizure-free for 26 weeks as assessed via 
the  occurrence  of  seizures  as  documented  in  the  seizure  diary.  For  the  primary  efficacy  analysis,  a 
subject  was  classified  as  having  achieved  a  26-week  seizure-free  period  if  they  were  free  of  all 
seizures, regardless of seizure type, for 26 weeks while receiving the same dose. 
The  key  secondary  efficacy  endpoint  was  the  proportion  of  subjects  seizure-free  for  at  least  a  12-
month. Other secondary efficacy variables included the time to withdrawal due to lack of efficacy/AE, 
time to the end of a 26-week and 52-week seizure-free period. 
Sample Size and Power Considerations 
The sample size was based on the primary efficacy endpoint of proportion of subjects seizure-free for 
at  least  6  months.  The  non-inferiority  margin  (delta)  is  a  relative  20%  difference  (e.g.,  an  absolute 
difference of 12% if proportion seizure-free is 60%) up to a maximum of an absolute 12% difference.  
Assuming that the proportion seizure-free in the ZNS and CBZ groups is 60%, 262 subjects per group 
were  required  to  conclude  that  ZNS  is  noninferior  to  CBZ  if  the  lower  limit  of  the  95%  CI  of  the 
treatment difference (CBZ – ZNS) is above –12% with 80% power and a 1-sided 0.025 alpha level. If 
the  proportion  of  seizure-free  subjects  in  both  groups  is  65%  or  70%,  then  262  subjects  per  group 
would provide 82% and 85% power, respectively. 
Allowing  for  a  10%  drop-out  rate,  a  total  of  582  subjects  were  to  be  randomized  in  a  ratio  of  1:1 
between ZNS:CBZ. 
Analysis 
The primary analysis was performed in the per-protocol population. The PP population was defined as 
the subset of the ITT Population who had no major protocol violations or deviations. 
A sensitivity analysis was performed in the ITT population. The ITT population was defined as defined 
as all randomized subjects who received at least one dose of study medication. 
The primary analysis presented the  difference in the proportion of subjects seizure-free for at least a 
six month (26 week) period between the two groups with a lower 95% confidence limit. Subjects were 
classified as having achieved a 6-month (26-week) seizure-free period if they were free of all seizures, 
regardless of seizure type, for 182 days receiving the same dose. 
All 581 treated subjects were included in the safety and ITT populations. For seizure-free endpoints in 
the ITT analyses, a subject with missing seizure data was assumed not to be seizure-free at that visit. 
If a subject  dropped out  before the end of the assessment period, they were considered not seizure-
free for that endpoint. 
No interim analysis was planned/conducted. 
Overall comments on Methods 
Study 310 was largely in line with the recommendation made for monotherapy studies in the Note for 
Guidance  on  Treatment  of  Epileptic  Disorders  (CPMP/EWP/566/98  rev  1).  The  company  also  adapted 
the study design in accordance to the scientific advice given e.g. dosage schedule of CBZ, extension of 
the maintenance phase to 12 month. 
Assessment report

It is noted that, as monotherapy studies in epilepsy only include an active control, assay sensitivity 
may be an inherent problem (see discussion on efficacy). 
In the context the known efficacy of ZNS in the add-on setting a single positive trial in monotherapy 
was considered sufficient. 
Population and baseline characteristics 
A total of 682 subjects were screened, 99 of which were excluded. Of the 583 subjects randomised 2 
were not treated. 
Subject disposition 
There were higher discontinuation rates for Zonisamide than Carbamazepine, although the 
discontinuations due to adverse events and lack of efficacy were the same between the two active 
treatments. 
127 out of 583 (21%) subjects were excluded from the PP population. The most common reasons for 
exclusion were subjects not being up-titrated according to protocol requirements following a seizure, 
missing seizure diaries during the FDP, and < 80% compliance. There were no obvious differences in 
reasons for exclusion between the treatment groups. 
Mean age, height, weight, BMI and distribution of gender were similar in both treatment groups.  
Baseline characteristics related to epilepsy were broadly similar. The mean number of fits in the 12 
months prior to randomisation was similar in both treatment groups as was prior medication use. A 
slightly higher proportion of those in the CBZ group (15.3% v 13.2%) had taken a prior AED or 
nervous system drug. Phenytoin was the most widely used AED in both groups.

2.4.4.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-
analysis) 
No pooled analyses or meta-analysis has been presented 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
There is no guidance on appropriate inferiority margins to be used: the Guideline on clinical 
investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of epileptic disorders states that “The non-
inferiority margin will need to be justified by the applicant”, and this has to be done on the basis of a 
clinically important difference in efficacy. 
Following the Scientific Advice, the MAH chose an absolute inferiority margin of 12%, based on an 
expected efficacy of 60% from CBZ and a relative difference in efficacy between CBZ and ZNS of 
≤20%, with the latter being based on ILAE guidance on rating studies to be used for evidence based 
guidelines of AEDs in initial monotherapy. No inferiority margin was set for the secondary efficacy 
variable of 52 week seizure freedom. 
In the pivotal study (310) Zonisamide was marginally (12.2%) outside the pre-specified inferiority 
margin of 12%. Carbamazepine efficacy as measured by the proportion of subjects seizure free for six 
months in the per-protocol population was unexpectedly high (83.7%). Likewise efficacy rates for 
zonisamide were also high, at 79.4%. This raised the question whether this might indicate that the 
population included was not at a high risk for seizures. 
The MAH was therefore asked to justify that the enrolled population was sufficiently at risk to enable 
finding differences between zonisamide and carbamazepine, if any, but also between these two 
products and placebo, if there had been one. 
The MAH provided evidence to demonstrate that the population studied in Study 310 was sensitive for 
seizures: patients included were at risk of recurrence given their baseline seizures, inclusion criteria of 
EEG abnormalities; moreover 25-30% of the patients in the study experienced at least one seizure in 
the double-blind phase. 
Median number of seizures pre-randomisation 
The median number of seizures in the year prior to randomization was similar for the Study 310 
population and other published trial populations, and varied from 3 to 4. In terms of design and 
efficacy endpoints the studies Brodie et al 2007 and Kwan et al 2001 are the most similar trials to the 
Zonisamide monotherapy RCT. The median number of seizures in the Kwan trial is 3 in both arms. In 
the Brodie 2007 trial subjects in carbamazepine arm had a median number of 3 seizures and those in 
the levetiracetam arm had 4. This is similar to the median number of seizures experienced by 
participants in both arms of the zonisamide monotherapy trial. 
Based on literature (Hauser et al., 1998; Kim et al., 2006; Marson et al., 2008) patients  in study 310 
were at a high risk for recurrence within 12 months: patients with two single unprovoked seizures had 
a risk of recurrence of a third seizure of 76%,  with a median time to recurrence of 4.5 months 
(Hauser 1998). Risk factors for recurrence included presence of a neurological disorder, abnormal EEG, 
and number of seizures pre-randomisation (Kim 2006). Based on this, patients in study 310 would be 
classified at risk of recurrence (>= 2 seizures, EEG abnormalities). The probability of recurrence after 
1 year was 59% for the immediate treatment group and 67% for the delayed treatment group (Kim 
2006). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/345694/2012  
Page 15/34
 
 
 
 
 
 
The CHMP accepted that the inclusion criteria for Study 310, Kwan et al 2011 and Brodie et al 2007 
were similar, so all three study populations should be at reasonably similar risk of seizures although a 
lower risk may occur by chance. The CHMP also agreed that in general clinical practice patients 
experiencing 2 partial seizures with confirmatory EEG evidence are started on an AED as monotherapy. 
Also, in study 310, patients were shown to be at high risk for recurrence within 12 months, which 
indicates that a population sensitive for seizures was included. 
A simulation of the expected number of seizures was performed, based on the seizure distribution at 3 
months and 12 months prior to the start of ZNS/CZB and under different assumptions of treatment 
efficacy. 
The results of the simulation (based on seizure distribution in the 12 and 3 months prior to 
randomisation) showed that the actual mean number of seizures experienced over 156 days in the 
study was approximately 20% of that which would be expected based on baseline seizure frequency in 
an untreated population.

Summary of results of simulations using alpha =0.25, beta=4.7 and assuming 30% 
withdrawals 
The simulation demonstrates that the actual mean number of seizures experienced over 156 days in 
the study is approximately 20% of that which would be expected in an untreated population. However 
it is unclear whether the model assumes that the risk of a further seizure remains similar regardless of 
how many previous seizures a study subject has experienced. This assumption may have been 
optimistic, but it is unlikely that a regression to the mean should result in such a reduction. This 
simulation provides some evidence that the population could be considered not to be at low risk of 
seizures. 
The observed treatment difference of -6.1% in Study 310 was contained within all simulation intervals 
when (95% ) where the efficacy of the two drugs were equal and ranged between 50 and 80%.   
The simulation using assumptions about difference in efficacy with and without withdrawals showed 
that where CBZ was assumed to be 10% more efficacious than ZNS and there were no withdrawals 
modelled efficacy rates were similar to those noted for the primary efficacy endpoint in Study 310. 
However when the model included a withdrawal rate of 30%, similar to that in Study 310, modelled 
efficacy rates were lower. 
Response rate by baseline seizure frequency 
Data from the 12 months baseline period indicate similar response rate irrespective of baseline seizure 
frequency with both treatment groups (ZNS: < 4 seizures 70.8%, > 4 seizures 65.2%; CBZ < 4 
seizures 74.1%, > 4 seizures 76.4%). Data from the 3 month baseline period indicate a lower 
response rate in ZNS treated patients with more than 4 seizures compared the CBZ treated patients. 
(ZNS: < 4 seizures 71.7%, > 4 seizures 52.9%; CBZ < 4 seizures 75.7%, > 4 seizures 68.9%). 
Results for the 12 months seizure freedom indicate a lower response rate in patients with more than 4 
seizures for both treatments. However this is not clinically unexpected in this more difficult to treat 
population and seizure freedom response rates remain relatively high (ZNS and CBZ combined total: < 
4 seizures 60%, > 4 seizures 56.7% from the 12 month baseline period and < 4 seizures 61.2%, > 4 
seizures 46.8% from the 3 month baseline period respectively). 
Differences in dosing schedules for CBZ between study 310 and Brodie, 2007 
It was noted that the response rates in study 310 were higher than the ones expected based on 
published literature. The higher initial dosing of CBZ may account for the higher response rate under 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/345694/2012  
Page 17/34
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CBZ in Study 310 compared to Brodie 2007 (83.7% v 73% in the PP population and 74.7% v 66.7% in 
the ITT population). The initial doses post titration for CBZ were 400mg/day Brodie 2007 and 
600mg/day Study 310. In addition to this there were also other differences e.g. the titration period for 
Brodie was 2 weeks as opposed to 4 weeks for the zonisamide trial.  
It could be the case that the superior efficacy seen for CBZ in study 310 could be due to the different 
initial doses post titration, however in both studies subjects experiencing a seizure could have their 
doses of CBZ up-titrated (to 800mg following the first seizure and 1200mg following the second 
seizure) in both trials and the maximum dose for CBZ (1200mg) was similar in both trials.

These data from Study 310 and Brodie et al., 2007 study support the concept that higher doses of CBZ 
will result in higher proportion of patients achieving 6 months seizure freedom. This is also supported 
by the general concept of dose-response proportionality observed with CBZ (Kwan et al., 2001). 
Size of effect 
The 6 month seizure freedom rate in the primary analysis PP population was 79.4% for zonisamide and 
83.7% for carbamazepine. The adjusted absolute difference was -4.5% with 95% CIs of -12.2% and 
3.1% . The lower limit for the 95% CI for the relative difference was -14.7% which was within the 
margin of 20%. 
The difference was larger in the ITT population, 69.4% for zonisamide and 74.7% for carbamazepine. 
The adjusted absolute difference was -6.1% with 95% confidence intervals of 13.6% and 1.4%. The 
lower CI for relative difference was -18% which was within the 20% margin set for relative difference. 
The difference between treatment groups was evident in the secondary analysis of 52 week seizure 
freedom rate in both the PP and ITT population (67.6% for zonisamide and 74.7% for carbamazepine 
with an adjusted absolute difference of -7.9%). 
The analyses by seizure history type were pre-planned, but were exploratory in nature and hence it 
was not possible to exclude that the high response rate to CBZ in the complex partial (CP) subgroup 
may be a spurious finding. The distribution of seizure types at the time of randomization was similar 
between treatment groups, although there was no stratification, and the analysis of 6-month seizure 
freedom rates by seizure type also demonstrated similar results across treatments. However, 93% of 
subjects with CP seizures at diagnosis responded to CBZ vs. 77% on ZNS. 
Subjects with complex seizures are more likely to develop secondary generalised tonic-clonic seizures. 
In this sub-group the adjusted difference in efficacy for ZNS and CBZ is 2.6% in favour of CBZ with

95% CI of -12.4% to 7.1%. Given that those with secondary generalisation, a more severe form of the 
disease (many of whom would have also had complex seizures) had similar response rates for ZNS and 
CBZ it is reasonable to assume that the large differences in efficacy noted in complex seizures could be 
due to chance. 
Hence whether the finding in complex partial seizures (CPS) is spurious or real remains uncertain, 
although there are indications that this is a spurious finding. Even if real, a lesser seizure control for 
CPS would not worsen the prognosis, as CPS are not a grand mal, and a partial seizure neither primes 
a patient to a second seizure nor to refractoriness to treatment.  In this sense, there is no risk of 
irreversible harm. 
2.5.  Clinical Safety aspects 
2.5.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
To support the clinical safety of the monotherapy claim data from 4 studies were submitted: 
 
 
the dose finding study (AN46046-304) and its open label long term safety study (ELN46046-355) 
the pivotal phase III randomised controlled trial (E2090-E-44-310) and its extension study (E2090-
E044-314). 
Study ELN46046-355 only recruited 32 participants and provides very limited information since the 
study was terminated by the Sponsor upon receipt of market authorization for Zonegran in the EU. 
Study 314 was ongoing at the time of submission therefore only preliminary, unaudited summary 
adverse event (AE) data for deaths, serious adverse events (SAEs), and discontinuations due to AEs 
are provided herein up to a cut-off date of 31 Dec 2010. Therefore the assessment is mainly focussed 
on studies 304 and 310. 
2.5.2.  Patient exposure 
For study 304 a total of 167 subjects were included in the safety population (25mg, 56: 100mg, 52 
and: 300mg, 59). 
For study 310 a total of 581 (ZNS, 281: CBZ, 300) subjects were included in the safety population. 
Time on trial and mean duration of exposure was similar in each treatment group. The maximum 
duration was 799 days for the ZNS group and 656 days for the CBZ group.

For Study 304 a total of 151 (90.4%) subjects reported TEAEs: 50 (89.3%) in the 25-mg/day group, 
47 (90.4%) in the 100-mg/day group, and 54 (91.5%) in the 300-mg/day group. TEAEs related to 
study drug were higher in the 300mg group 52.5% compared to 44.2% in the 100mg group and 
41.1% in the 25mg group. 
The following TEAEs were reported most frequently (at least 10% of subjects overall): headache 
44.9%, nausea 21.6%, infection 18.0%, dizziness 16.8%, rhinitis 15.0%, asthenia 14.4%, abdominal 
pain 12.0%, pharyngitis 12.0%, insomnia 11.4%, anorexia 10.2%, diarrhoea 10.2%, and somnolence 
10.2%. 
For Study 310 The most commonly experienced TEAEs (incidence of ≥ 4% in any treatment group) 
were headache (ZNS: 10.3%; CBZ: 12.3%), decreased appetite (ZNS: 7.8%; CBZ: 1.7%), 
somnolence (ZNS: 6.0%; CBZ: 7.7%), dizziness (ZNS: 3.9%; CBZ: 7.7%), weight decreased (ZNS: 
6.8%; CBZ: 0%), fatigue (ZNS: 4.6%; CBZ: 4.0%), rash (ZNS: 2.1%; CBZ: 4.3%), and pyrexia (ZNS: 
3.9%; CBZ: 4.0%). 
In addition to the most common TEAEs noted above, a notable difference between treatment groups 
was observed for the Psychiatric disorders SOC (ZNS: 9.3%; CBZ: 4.7%), though the highest 
incidence of any specific event in this SOC was low (2.1%). In this SOC, the incidence of depression 
(1.9% overall), depressed mood (0.7% overall), and depressive symptoms (0.2% overall) was low and 
similar across treatments. 
Three TEAEs occurred at an incidence which differed by ≥3% between treatment groups. Weight loss 
(weight decreased [ZNS, 6.8%; CBZ, 0%]) and decreased appetite (ZNS, 7.8%; CBZ, 1.7%) were 
reported more often in ZNS-treated subjects, and dizziness (ZNS, 3.9%; CBZ, 7.7%) was reported 
more often in CBZ-treated subjects. 
The most frequent types of TEAEs in each group were consistent with the expected AE profiles of the 
study medications. Differences between the groups such as higher incidences of decreased appetite, 
weight loss, and insomnia in the ZNS group, and a higher incidence of dizziness and rash in the CBZ 
group were also in keeping with the known AE profiles of the two drugs. 
Concerning long term safety in the extension study of study 310 (study 355), ZNS and CBZ did not 
show any new safety or tolerability issues.  The incidence of treatment related TEAEs appears to be 
slightly higher for zonisamide than carbamazepine. The number of serious treatment related TEAEs 
were low in both groups (5% ZNS and 4% CBZ). No cases of Steven’s Johnson syndrome, toxic 
epidermal necrolysis or metabolic acidosis were identified. The CHMP concluded that no new safety or 
tolerability issues were identified. 
2.5.4.  Serious adverse events and deaths 
In Study 304 one subject in the 300 mg /day group died in a road traffic accident on day 28 of the 
study. Limited information was available regarding the event and the investigator reported the event 
as not related. 
Nonfatal serious TEAEs occurred in 9 (5.4%) subjects; all serious TEAEs were unrelated to treatment 
with study medication. 
Other significant adverse events reported included weight loss, rash, maculopapular rash, 
vesiculobullous rash, kidney calculus, fever, thirst, dehydration, and sweating. Weight loss was 
reported as an AE by five subjects (3.0% overall), two of whom had weight decreases ≥ 10% or more, 
one of whom withdrew from the study due to this event. 
Adverse events leading to withdrawal were commonest in the 300mg treatment group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/345694/2012  
Page 22/34
 
 
 
 
In study 310 Nonfatal SAEs occurred in similar proportions in each treatment group (ZNS: 5.0%; CBZ: 
5.7%). One ZNS subject experienced a life-threatening nonfatal SAE (brain neoplasm unrelated to 
treatment), leading to withdrawal from the study. Ten subjects (three on ZNS, seven on CBZ) 
experienced nonfatal SAEs which were related to treatment. Both treatment groups had subjects with 
SAEs requiring or prolonging hospitalization and important medical events. 
Individual treatment related SAEs in the ZNS treatment arm concerned purpura (n=1), acute psychosis 
(n=1) and complex partial seizure (n=1). Treatment related SAEs in the CBZ group concerned suicidal 
ideation (n=1), rash (n=2), increased hepatic enzyme (n-1), bradycardia (n-1), partial seizures, with 
sec. generalisation (n=1) and head injury with facial bones fracture (n=1). 
One ZNS-treated subject died suddenly during the night. The death was reported at 1 day after 
receiving the last dose of study drug. The subject was a 50 year old male and had a history of 
myocardial infarction. ECG at screening was normal. No diagnosis was made and the death was 
recorded as unexplained and unrelated to treatment. 
Rates of discontinuation due to adverse events were similar in both groups. The most commonly 
reported TEAEs that resulted in discontinuation of therapy were rash (ZNS, 1.1% vs. CBZ, 2.7%), 
fatigue (ZNS, 1.8 % vs. CBZ, 0%), and dizziness (ZNS, 1.1% vs. CBZ, 1.3%). The remaining TEAEs 
resulting in discontinuation occurred in < 1.1% of subjects in either group. In addition to these AEs, a 
slightly higher proportion of ZNS subjects discontinued therapy due to psychiatric disorders (ZNS: 
2.5%; CBZ: 1.3%). 
2.5.5.  Adverse events of interest 
Weight loss 
A total of 36 ZNS-treated subjects (13.2%) and 4 CBZ-treated subjects (1.4%) had > 10% body 
weight loss at any post-Baseline visit, but cases of weight loss (weight decreased) were reported as 
TEAEs in ZNS-treated subjects only (ZNS, 6.8%; CBZ, 0%). This corresponds with an increased 
incidence of decreased appetite in ZNS-treated subjects (ZNS, 7.8%; CBZ, 1.7%). This event is in 
accordance with the special warnings and precautions for Zonegran use as it has been commonly 
reported with adjunctive therapy. Two subjects, both of whom were on ZNS treatment, had > 20% 
body weight loss. This was not reported as an SAE for either, and both subjects completed the study. 
This is a potentially important adverse event affecting over 10% of those treated with Zonisamide, 
which is of concern. 
Metabolic acidosis 
Hyperchloremic, non-anion gap, metabolic acidosis (i.e., decreased serum bicarbonate below the 
normal reference range in the absence of chronic respiratory alkalosis) is associated with Zonegran 
treatment. Bicarbonate levels decreased by ≥ 3.5 mmol/L were observed in 121 subjects (51.1%) in 
the ZNS arm and 45 subjects (17.4%) in the CBZ group. Nine ZNS-treated subjects (3.8%) and 1 
CBZ-treated subject (0.4%) had a bicarbonate value of ≤ 16 mmol/L and a decrease from baseline of 
≥ 6 mmol/L. There were no corresponding reports of respiratory alkalosis or metabolic acidosis during 
the study.

Page 23/34
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Laboratory findings /vital signs 
The results from studies 310, 304, and 355 did not provide evidence of an adverse effect of ZNS on 
haematology and clinical chemistry parameters except for bicarbonate. Isolated abnormal values were 
observed in some subjects but, given the duration of ZNS treatment in some studies, these findings 
are consistent with the normal pattern of laboratory values over time. 
In study 310, the decreases in bicarbonate (mean −2.8 mmol/L) were generally small to moderate, 
and were similar to what has been described in previous trials. Decreases from baseline of 
≥ 3.5 mmol/L were observed in 121 subjects (51.1%) in the ZNS group and 45 subjects (17.4%) in 
the CBZ group. Nine ZNS-treated subjects (3.8%) and 1 CBZ-treated subject (0.4%) had a 
bicarbonate value of ≤ 16 mmol/L and a decrease from Baseline of ≥ 6 mmol/L. Decreased 
bicarbonate was not reported as an AE in any subject and there were no reports of metabolic acidosis. 
In study 304 subjects who had a baseline serum bicarbonate level ≥ 17 mEq/L, the incidence of 
subjects meeting criteria (i.e., postbaseline levels < 17 mEq/L with a corresponding decrease from 
baseline > 5 mEq/L) at any visit was 3.8% in the 25-mg/d group, 4.2% in the 100-mg/d group, and 
15.7% in the 300-mg/d group. 
There were no unexpected findings in vital signs, ECGs, physical examinations, or neurological 
examinations in any of the Phase 3 zonisamide monotherapy studies. 
2.5.6.  Safety in special populations 
Pregnancy 
Three subjects became pregnant during Study 310. One subject in the ZNS 400 mg/d group became 
pregnant during titration. The pregnancy was terminated medically due to “abnormal scan results” 
which were not further specified. She had no other AEs recorded and was withdrawn from the study. A 
second subject became pregnant while on CBZ 600 mg. She was discontinued from the study and had 
a normal vaginal delivery at 39 weeks; no other events were reported. The third subject on CBZ 
600 mg became pregnant and was withdrawn from the study. After her last menstrual period, study 
drug was discontinued. The outcome of the pregnancy is unknown. 
In Study 304, two subjects became pregnant and were withdrawn from the study. One subject had an 
elective abortion; the other had a normal pregnancy and delivered a healthy baby boy without any 
complications. 
There were no reported pregnancies during Study 355. 
2.5.7.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The most frequent types of TEAEs in each treatment group were consistent with the expected safety 
profiles of the study medications. 
Differences between the groups such as higher incidences of decreased appetite, weight loss, and 
insomnia in the ZNS group and a higher incidence of dizziness and rash in the CBZ group were also in 
accordance with the specific and established safety profiles of each of the two drugs.

2.6.  Risk management plan 
Version 7 of the RMP is the current one at the time of approval of this variation. The reasons for the 
updates submitted since the start of this variation procedure (version 5 of the RMP) were to reflect the 
availability  of  the  monotherapy  study  data  and  in  order  to  convert  to  the  EMA  template  format.  The 
changes to the RMP are extensive due to reformatting; however, the content was consistent with the 
previously  submitted  versions  of  the  safety  specification  (version  3)  and  pharmacovigilance  plan 
(version 4). 
No new risks have been added to the RMP as a result of completion of the monotherapy studies or as a 
consequence of PSUR 8 and thus no additional risk minimisation measures are planned.  
The MAH was requested in the first RSI to amend the following areas of the RMP: 
  Renal effects seen in the non-clinical studies in section 1.1.1 of the safety specification.  
 
The  risk  of  osteopenia  is  linked  to  the  risk  of  metabolic  acidosis  and  should  be  mentioned 
throughout the RMP.

The  RMP  was  updated  to  reflect  the  agreed  wording  of  the  SmPC  in  relation  to  currently

Dosage escalation and maintenance 
Zonegran may be taken as monotherapy or added to existing therapy in adults.  The dose should be 
titrated on the basis of clinical effect. Recommended escalation and maintenance doses are given in 
Table 1.  Some patients, especially those not taking CYP3A4-inducing agents, may respond to lower 
doses.

When Zonegran treatment is to be discontinued, it should be withdrawn gradually (see section 4.4). In 
clinical studies of adult patients, dose reductions of 100 mg at weekly intervals have been used with 
concurrent adjustment of other antiepileptic medicine doses (where necessary).

4.8  Undesirable effects 
[…] 
The most common adverse reactions in controlled adjunctive-therapy studies in adults were 
somnolence, dizziness and anorexia.  The most common adverse reactions in a randomised, controlled 
monotherapy trial comparing zonisamide with carbamazepine prolonged release were decreased 
bicarbonate, decreased appetite, and decreased weight.  The incidence of markedly abnormally low 
serum bicarbonate (a decrease to less than 17 mEq/l and by more than 5 mEq/l) was 3.8%. The 
incidence of marked decreases in weight of 20% or more was 0.7%.

Clinical efficacy 
Monotherapy in partial seizures with or without secondary generalisation. 
Efficacy of zonisamide as monotherapy was established in a double-blind, parallel group, non-
inferiority comparison to carbamazepine prolonged release (PR) in 583 adult subjects with newly 
diagnosed partial seizures with or without secondary generalised tonic-clonic seizures.  Subjects

were randomised to carbamazepine and zonisamide received treatment for a duration of up to 24 
months depending on response.  Subjects were titrated to the initial target dose of 600 mg 
carbamazepine or 300 mg of zonisamide. Subjects who experienced a seizure were titrated to the 
next target dose i.e. 800 mg carbamazepine or 400 mg of zonisamide.  Subjects who experienced 
a further seizure were titrated to the maximal target dose of 1200 mg carbamazepine or 500 mg 
zonisamide. Subjects who were seizure-free for 26 weeks at a target dose level continued on this 
dose for another 26 weeks.  Main outcomes of this study are presented in this table:

ANNEX IIIB PACKAGE LEAFLET 
WHAT ZONEGRAN IS AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
[…] 
Zonegran is used to treat adults who are already taking other antiepileptic medicines but are still 
experiencing seizures that affect one part of the brain (partial seizure), which may or may not be 
followed by a seizure affecting all of the brain (secondary generalisation).  
Zonegran may be used: 
  On its own to treat seizures in adults. 
  With other antiepileptic medicines to treat seizures in adults. 
HOW TO TAKE ZONEGRAN 
[…] 
The usual adult dose 
When you take Zonegran on its own: 
 
 
 
The starting dose is 100 mg taken once a day. 
This may be increased by up to 100 mg at intervals of two weeks. 
The usual dose is 300 mg once a day. 
When you take Zonegran with other antiepileptic medicines: 
 
 
The starting dose is 50 mg daily taken in two equal doses of 25 mg. 
[…] 
Changes  were  also  made  to  the  PI  to  bring  it  in  line  with  the  current  Agency/QRD  template,  SmPC 
guideline and other relevant guideline(s), which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP. 
3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Zonisamide is a known anti-epileptic agent indicated for the adjunctive treatment of adult patients with 
partial seizures, with or without secondary generalisation. As such, the antiepileptic properties of 
zonisamide are not at stake. 
In order to support a monotherapy indication it is necessary to establish the correct dose for the 
monotherapy indication, and to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of zonisamide in the absence of 
anti-epileptic co-medication. 
Study 310 showed that zonisamide has similar response rates in the control of partial seizures to 
carbamazepine retard. The study was performed in accordance with EMA guidance on the investigation 
of medicinal products in the treatment of epileptic disorders and the scientific advice given. The step 
wise fixed dose increments based on response and the long follow up period recommended in the 
guideline is meant as a check on assay sensitivity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/345694/2012

The proportion of subjects exposed to zonisamide in the per protocol population (primary analysis) who 
were seizure free for 6 months was 79.4% compared to 83.7% in those exposed to carbamazepine, a 
difference of -4.5% in favour of carbamazepine (95% confidence interval (-12.2%, 3.1%). 
Additional evidence for efficacy comes from the fixed dose response study, study 304. Although the 
results of study 304 are inconclusive, i.e. not statistically significant, the trend in favour of the 300 mg 
dose is considered supportive for the monotherapy claim. 
Zonisamide could offer an alternative in the therapeutic armamentarium because of its different 
mechanism of action, the once daily dosing, and a different interaction profile. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The results of Study 310, which was carried out in line with EMA guidance and the scientific advice, 
showed that in the per protocol population 79.4% of those exposed to zonisamide were seizure free at 
6 months compared to 83.7% of those exposed to carbamazepine. This was an actual difference of -
4.5% in favour of carbamazepine (CI -12.2%, 3.1%). The lower confidence interval of 12.2 was 
slightly outside the pre-defined absolute inferiority margin of 12%. Initially, the assay sensitivity of the 
trial was questioned, but this has been resolved during subsequent discussion (see discussion on 
clinical efficacy). 
Zonisamide showed consistently lower results than carbamazepine in study 310. However, overall the 
response rates were high in both study arms (80%), and the difference in point estimates was less 
than 5%. Retention rates were similar, which was reassuring. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
With respect to safety there were no large differences between zonisamide and carbamazepine in 
incidence of adverse events, or incidence of severe or serious adverse events. The adverse event 
profile of each compound was consistent with each established safety profiles. It cannot be concluded, 
based on the observed adverse events, that one drug is superior to the other in terms of safety: their 
safety profiles are different. ZNS has a better profile regarding skin events whereas CBZ has a better 
one with respect to psychiatric disorders. The choice of the most appropriate treatment would depend 
on the patient’s history and circumstances, and the patient’s specific vulnerability to these events. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
No unexpected unfavorable effects have emerged. Given the small numbers, low incidences and small 
sample size, the differences evidenced in the studies presented in this submission are not considered 
of clinical significance. 
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
While Zonisamide has shown a consistently lower response rate as compared to CBZ, in the primary -
and most important- analysis ZNS still showed a high response rate. Additionally, the difference in 
point estimates between ZNS and CBZ was less than 5%, and retention rates were similar in the two 
arms. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/345694/2012  
Page 30/34
 
 
 
 
 
In light of the fact that the safety profile differs qualitatively and that there were no large safety 
differences between zonisamide and carbamazepine in incidence of adverse events, or incidence of 
severe or serious adverse events, the CHMP considered that it could offer an alternative to CBZ 
treatment because of the different mechanism of action, once daily dosing, and the interaction profile. 
The choice of appropriate treatment would depend on the patient’s history, circumstances, and 
vulnerability to the ADR profile of the medication of choice. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The anti-epileptic properties of Zonisamide as such are not at stake, as efficacy in the add-on setting 
has been proven, and the adverse event profile of each compound was consistent with the expected 
adverse reaction profiles. 
Zonisamide could offer an alternative in the therapeutic armamentarium because of the different 
mechanism of action, once daily dosing, and the interaction profile. 
Divergent positions are presented in Appendix 1. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
In order to support a monotherapy indication it is necessary to establish the correct dose for the 
monotherapy indication and to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of Zonisamide in the absence of 
other anti-epileptic co-medication. 
The pre-defined inferiority margin of 12% was not met, with a lower 95% CI for the inferiority margin 
of -12.2%:  the MAH substantiated the assay sensitivity and this allowed the conclusion that a lower 
level of efficacy was acceptable because of the high response rate shown to ZNS treatment, the less 
than 5% difference between point estimates (absolute and relative) and the similar retention rates of 
ZNS and CBZ in the pivotal clinical trial. 
The different safety profile of ZNS versus CBZ can offer an alternative treatment that can be more 
appropriate depending on the patient’s specific vulnerability to adverse reactions. In addition the once 
daily dose of ZNS offers an advantage in terms of convenience and presumably also for compliance. 
The choice of treatment will depend, in clinical practice, on the patient’s medical history. 
Therefore, the CHMP considered that the benefit risk balance for zonisamide in the new indication 
“monotherapy in the treatment of partial seizures, with or without secondary generalisation, in adults 
with newly diagnosed epilepsy” is positive.

Divergent Position 
The undersigned member of CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s opinion recommending the adoption 
of the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the new therapeutic indication 
for Zonegran. 
The reasons for the divergent opinion were as follows: 
The benefit-risk balance of zonisamide in monotherapy is considered unfavourable. In particular, the 
clinical benefit associated with the observed results for Zonegran is questionable, as the assay 
sensitivity has not been adequately substantiated, and the high response rate in the pivotal trial 
warranted a more precise estimate in comparison to carbamazepine to adequately establish and 
contextualise the efficacy of zonisamide.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus 
Mounjaro is indicated for the treatment of adults with insufficiently controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus 
as an adjunct to diet and exercise  
• 
as monotherapy when metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance or 
contraindications 
in addition to other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes.  
• 
For study results with respect to combinations, effects on glycaemic control and the populations 
studied, see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1. 
Weight management 
Mounjaro is indicated as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity for weight 
management, including weight loss and weight maintenance, in adults with an initial Body Mass Index 
(BMI) of 
•  ≥ 30 kg/m2 (obesity) or 
•  ≥ 27 kg/m2 to < 30 kg/m2 (overweight) in the presence of at least one weight-related comorbid 
condition (e.g., hypertension, dyslipidaemia, obstructive sleep apnoea, cardiovascular disease, 
prediabetes, or type 2 diabetes mellitus). 
4.2   Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
The starting dose of tirzepatide is 2.5 mg once weekly. After 4 weeks, the dose should be increased to 
5 mg once weekly. If needed, dose increases can be made in 2.5 mg increments after a minimum of 
4 weeks on the current dose.  
The recommended maintenance doses are 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg. 
The maximum dose is 15 mg once weekly.  
When tirzepatide is added to existing metformin and/or sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitor 
(SGLT2i) therapy, the current dose of metformin and/or SGLT2i can be continued.  
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
When tirzepatide is added to existing therapy of a sulphonylurea and/or insulin, a reduction in the dose 
of sulphonylurea or insulin may be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Blood glucose 
self-monitoring is necessary to adjust the dose of sulphonylurea and insulin. A stepwise approach to 
insulin reduction is recommended (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).  
Missed doses 
If a dose is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible within 4 days after the missed dose. 
If more than 4 days have passed, skip the missed dose and administer the next dose on the regularly 
scheduled day. In each case, patients can then resume their regular once weekly dosing schedule. 
Changing the dosing schedule 
The day of weekly administration can be changed, if necessary, as long as the time between two doses 
is at least 3 days. 
Special populations 
Elderly, gender, race, ethnicity or body weight 
No dose adjustment is needed based on age, gender, race, ethnicity or body weight (see sections 5.1 
and 5.2). Only very limited data are available from patients aged ≥ 85 years.  
Renal impairment  
No dose adjustment is required for patients with renal impairment including end stage renal disease 
(ESRD). Experience with the use of tirzepatide in patients with severe renal impairment and ESRD is 
limited. Caution should be exercised when treating these patients with tirzepatide (see section 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment  
No dose adjustment is required for patients with hepatic impairment. Experience with the use of 
tirzepatide in patients with severe hepatic impairment is limited. Caution should be exercised when 
treating these patients with tirzepatide (see section 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of tirzepatide in children aged less than 18 years have not yet been established. 
No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Mounjaro is to be injected subcutaneously in the abdomen, thigh or upper arm. 
The dose can be administered at any time of day, with or without meals.  
Injection sites should be rotated with each dose. If a patient also injects insulin, they should inject 
Mounjaro into a different injection site. 
Patients should be advised to carefully read the instructions for use included with the package leaflet 
before administering the medicinal product.  
Vial 
Patients and their caregivers should be trained in subcutaneous injection technique before 
administering Mounjaro.   
For further information before administration see section 6.6.

4.3  Contraindications  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use  
Acute pancreatitis 
Tirzepatide has not been studied in patients with a history of pancreatitis, and should be used with 
caution in these patients. 
Acute pancreatitis has been reported in patients treated with tirzepatide. 
Patients should be informed of the symptoms of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is suspected, 
tirzepatide should be discontinued. If the diagnosis of pancreatitis is confirmed, tirzepatide should not 
be restarted. In the absence of other signs and symptoms of acute pancreatitis, elevations in pancreatic 
enzymes alone are not predictive of acute pancreatitis (see section 4.8). 
Hypoglycaemia 
Patients receiving tirzepatide in combination with an insulin secretagogue (for example, a 
sulphonylurea) or insulin may have an increased risk of hypoglycaemia. The risk of hypoglycaemia 
may be lowered by a reduction in the dose of the insulin secretagogue or insulin (see sections 4.2 and 
4.8). 
Gastrointestinal effects 
Tirzepatide has been associated with gastrointestinal adverse reactions, which include nausea, 
vomiting, and diarrhoea (see section 4.8). These adverse reactions may lead to dehydration, which 
could lead to a deterioration in renal function including acute renal failure. Patients treated with 
tirzepatide should be advised of the potential risk of dehydration, due to the gastrointestinal adverse 
reactions and take precautions to avoid fluid depletion and electrolyte disturbances. This should 
particularly be considered in the elderly, who may be more susceptible to such complications. 
Severe gastrointestinal disease 
Tirzepatide has not been studied in patients with severe gastrointestinal disease, including severe 
gastroparesis, and should be used with caution in these patients. 
Diabetic retinopathy 
Tirzepatide has not been studied in patients with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy requiring acute 
therapy, proliferative diabetic retinopathy or diabetic macular oedema, and should be used with 
caution in these patients with appropriate monitoring. 
Sodium content 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Tirzepatide delays gastric emptying and thereby has the potential to impact the rate of absorption of 
concomitantly administered oral medicinal products. This effect, resulting in decreased Cmax and a 
delayed tmax, is most pronounced at the time of tirzepatide treatment initiation. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on the results from a study with paracetamol, which was used as a model medicinal product to 
evaluate the effect of tirzepatide on gastric emptying, no dose adjustments are expected to be required 
for most concomitantly administered oral medicinal products. However, it is recommended to monitor 
patients on oral medicinal products with a narrow therapeutic index (e.g., warfarin, digoxin), 
especially at initiation of tirzepatide treatment and following dose increase. The risk of delayed effect 
should also be considered for oral medicinal products for which a rapid onset of effect is of 
importance. 
Paracetamol 
Following a 5 mg single dose of tirzepatide, the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of paracetamol 
was reduced by 50 %, and the median (tmax) was delayed by 1 hour. The effect of tirzepatide on the 
oral absorption of paracetamol is dose and time dependent. At low doses (0.5 and 1.5 mg), there was 
only a minor change in paracetamol exposure. After four consecutive weekly doses of tirzepatide 
(5/5/8/10 mg), no effect on the paracetamol Cmax and tmax was observed. The overall exposure (AUC) 
was not influenced. No dose adjustment of paracetamol is necessary when administered with 
tirzepatide. 
Oral contraceptives 
Administration of a combination oral contraceptive (0.035 mg ethinyl estradiol plus 0.25 mg 
norgestimate, a prodrug of norelgestromin) in the presence of a single dose of tirzepatide (5 mg) 
resulted in a reduction of oral contraceptive Cmax and area under the curve (AUC). Ethinyl estradiol 
Cmax was reduced by 59 % and AUC by 20 % with a delay in tmax of 4 hours. Norelgestromin Cmax was 
reduced by 55 % and AUC by 23 % with a delay in tmax of 4.5 hours. Norgestimate Cmax was reduced 
by 66 %, and AUC by 20 % with a delay in tmax of 2.5 hours. This reduction in exposure after a single 
dose of tirzepatide is not considered clinically relevant.  No dose adjustment of oral contraceptives is 
required. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or a limited amount of data from the use of tirzepatide in pregnant women. Studies in 
animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Tirzepatide is not recommended during 
pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using contraception.   
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether tirzepatide is excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborn/infant cannot be 
excluded.  
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from 
tirzepatide therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of 
therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
The effect of tirzepatide on fertility in humans is unknown. 
Animal studies with tirzepatide did not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to fertility (see 
section 5.3). 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Tirzepatide has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive or use machines. When tirzepatide is 
used in combination with a sulphonylurea or insulin, patients should be advised to take precautions to 
avoid hypoglycaemia while driving and using machines (see section 4.4). 
4.8  Undesirable effects  
Summary of safety profile 
In 9 completed phase 3 studies, 7 702 patients were exposed to tirzepatide alone or in combination 
with other glucose lowering medicinal products. The most frequently reported adverse reactions were 
gastrointestinal disorders, including nausea (very common), diarrhoea (very common), constipation 
(common), and vomiting (common). In general, these reactions were mostly mild or moderate in 
severity and occurred more often during dose escalation and decreased over time (see sections 4.2, and 
4.4). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following related adverse reactions from clinical studies are listed below by system organ class 
and in order of decreasing incidence (very common: ≥ 1/10; common: ≥ 1/100 to < 1/10; uncommon: 
≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100; rare: ≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000; very rare: < 1/10 000). Within each incidence

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with tirzepatide in the pool of T2DM placebo-controlled 
trials, sometimes severe (e.g., urticaria and eczema); hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 3.2 % 
of tirzepatide-treated patients compared to 1.7 % of placebo-treated patients. Cases of anaphylactic 
reaction and angioedema have been rarely reported with marketed use of tirzepatide. 
Hypersensitivity reactions have been reported with tirzepatide in the pool of placebo-controlled trials 
in patients with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 with or without T2DM, sometimes severe (e.g., rash and dermatitis); 
hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 5.0 % of tirzepatide-treated patients compared to 2.3 % of 
placebo-treated patients. 
Hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus 
Clinically significant hypoglycaemia (blood glucose < 3.0 mmol/L (< 54 mg/dL) or severe 
hypoglycaemia (requiring the assistance of another person)) occurred in 10 to 14 % (0.14 to 
0.16 events/patient year) of patients when tirzepatide was added to sulphonylurea and in 14 to 19 % 
(0.43 to 0.64 events/patient year) of patients when tirzepatide was added to basal insulin. 
The rate of clinically significant hypoglycaemia when tirzepatide was used as monotherapy or when 
added to other oral antidiabetic medicinal products was up to 0.04 events/patient year (see table 1 and 
sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
In phase 3 clinical studies, 10 (0.2 %) patients reported 12 episodes of severe hypoglycaemia. Of these 
10 patients, 5 (0.1 %) were on a background of insulin glargine or sulphonylurea who reported 
1 episode each.  
Gastrointestinal adverse reactions 
In the placebo-controlled T2DM phase 3 studies, gastrointestinal disorders were dose-dependently 
increased for tirzepatide 5 mg (37.1 %), 10 mg (39.6 %) and 15 mg (43.6 %) compared with placebo 
(20.4 %). Nausea occurred in 12.2 %, 15.4 % and 18.3 % versus 4.3 % and diarrhoea in 11.8 %, 
13.3 % and 16.2 % versus 8.9 % for tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg versus placebo. 
Gastrointestinal adverse reactions were mostly mild (74 %) or moderate (23.3 %) in severity. The 
incidence of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea was higher during the dose escalation period and 
decreased over time.  
More patients in the tirzepatide 5 mg (3.0 %), 10 mg (5.4 %) and 15 mg (6.6 %) groups compared to 
the placebo group (0.4 %) discontinued permanently due to the gastrointestinal event. 
In the placebo-controlled phase 3 studies in patients with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 with or without T2DM, 
gastrointestinal disorders were increased for tirzepatide 5 mg (51.3 %), 10 mg (55.2 %) and 15 mg 
(55.6 %) compared with placebo (28.5 %). Nausea occurred in 22.1 %, 28.8 % and 27.9 % versus 
8.3 % and diarrhoea in 16.9 %, 19.3 % and 21.7 % versus 8.0 % for tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg and 
15 mg respectively versus placebo. Gastrointestinal adverse reactions were mostly mild (63 %) or 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
moderate (32.6 %) in severity. The incidence of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea was higher during the 
dose escalation period and decreased over time.  
More patients in the tirzepatide 5 mg (2.0 %), 10 mg (4.5 %) and 15 mg (4.3 %) groups compared to 
the placebo group (0.5 %) discontinued permanently due to the gastrointestinal event. 
Gallbladder-related events  
In the pool of placebo-controlled phase 3 studies in patients with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 with or without 
T2DM, the overall incidence of cholecystitis and cholecystitis acute was 0.5 % and 0 % for 
tirzepatide- and placebo-treated patients, respectively. 
In the pool of placebo-controlled phase 3 studies in patients with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 with or without 
T2DM, acute gallbladder disease was reported by 1.6 % of tirzepatide-treated patients and 1.0 % of 
placebo-treated patients. These acute gallbladder events were positively associated with weight 
reduction. 
Immunogenicity  
5 025 tirzepatide-treated patients in the T2DM phase 3 clinical studies were assessed for anti-drug 
antibodies (ADAs). Of these, 51.1 % developed treatment-emergent (TE) ADAs during the on-
treatment period. In 38.3 % of the assessed patients, TE ADAs were persistent (ADAs present for a 
period of 16-weeks or greater). 1.9 % and 2.1 % had neutralizing antibodies against tirzepatide activity 
on the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) 
receptors, respectively and 0.9 % and 0.4 % had neutralising antibodies against native GIP and GLP-1, 
respectively. There was no evidence of an altered pharmacokinetic profile or an impact on efficacy of 
tirzepatide associated with the development of ADAs. 
6 206 tirzepatide-treated patients with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 with or without T2DM were assessed in the 
phase 3 clinical studies for anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). Of these, 56.1 % developed treatment-
emergent (TE) ADAs during the on-treatment period. In 43.1 % of the assessed patients, TE ADAs 
were persistent (ADAs present for a period of 16 weeks or greater). 2.2 % and 2.4 % had neutralising 
antibodies against tirzepatide activity on the glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and 
glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors, respectively and 0.8 % and 0.3 % had neutralising 
antibodies against native GIP and GLP-1, respectively.  
Heart rate 
In the placebo-controlled T2DM phase 3 studies, treatment with tirzepatide resulted in a maximum 
mean increase in heart rate of 3 to 5 beats per minute. The maximum mean increase in heart rate in 
placebo-treated patients was 1 beat per minute.  
The percentage of patients who had a change of baseline heart rate of > 20 bpm for 2 or more 
consecutive visits was 2.1 %, 3.8 % and 2.9 %, for tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg, respectively, 
compared with 2.1 % for placebo. 
Small mean increases in PR interval were observed with tirzepatide when compared to placebo (mean 
increase of 1.4 to 3.2 msec and mean decrease of 1.4 msec respectively). No difference in arrhythmia 
and cardiac conduction disorder treatment emergent events were observed between tirzepatide 5 mg, 
10 mg, 15 mg and placebo (3.8 %, 2.1 %, 3.7 % and 3 % respectively). 
In the placebo-controlled phase 3 studies in patients with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 with or without T2DM, 
treatment with tirzepatide resulted in a maximum mean increase in heart rate of 3 to 5 beats per 
minute. The maximum mean increase in heart rate in placebo-treated patients was 1 beat per minute.

The percentage of patients who had a change in baseline heart rate of > 20 bpm for 2 or more 
consecutive visits was 1.0 %, 2.4 % and 3.3 %, for tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg, respectively, 
compared with 0.7 % for placebo. 
Small mean increases in PR interval were observed with tirzepatide and placebo (mean increase of 
0.3 to 1.3 msec and of 0.6 msec respectively). No difference in arrhythmia and cardiac conduction 
disorder treatment emergent events were observed between tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 
placebo (3.9 %, 3.1 %, 3.6 % and 3.3 % respectively). 
Injection site reactions 
In the placebo-controlled T2DM phase 3 studies, injection site reactions were increased for tirzepatide 
(3.2 %) compared with placebo (0.4 %).  
In the placebo-controlled phase 3 studies in patients with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 with or without T2DM, 
injection site reactions were increased for tirzepatide (7.2 %) compared with placebo (1.8 %).  
Overall, in the phase 3 studies, the most common signs and symptoms of injection site reactions were 
erythema and pruritus. The maximum severity of injection site reactions for patients was mild (91 %) 
or moderate (9 %). No injection site reactions were serious. 
Pancreatic enzymes 
In the placebo-controlled T2DM phase 3 studies, treatment with tirzepatide resulted in mean increases 
from baseline in pancreatic amylase of 33 % to 38 % and lipase of 31 % to 42 %. Placebo treated 
patients had an increase from baseline in amylase of 4 % and no changes were observed in lipase.  
In the placebo-controlled phase 3 studies in patients with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 with or without T2DM, 
treatment with tirzepatide resulted in mean increases from baseline in pancreatic amylase of 20 % to 
24 % and lipase of 29 % to 35 %. Placebo treated patients had an increase from baseline in amylase of 
3.8 % and in lipase of 5.3 %.  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In the event of overdose, appropriate supportive treatment should be initiated according to the 
patient’s clinical signs and symptoms. Patients may experience gastrointestinal adverse reactions 
including nausea. There is no specific antidote for overdose of tirzepatide. A prolonged period of 
observation and treatment of these symptoms may be necessary, taking into account the half-life of 
tirzepatide (approximately 5 days).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties  
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, blood glucose lowering drugs, excl. insulins, 
ATC code: A10BX16  
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mechanism of action 
Tirzepatide is a long acting GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist. Both receptors are present on the 
pancreatic α and β endocrine cells, heart, vasculature, immune cells (leukocytes), gut and kidney. GIP 
receptors are also present on adipocytes.  
In addition, both GIP and GLP-1 receptors are expressed in the areas of the brain important to appetite 
regulation. 
Tirzepatide is highly selective to human GIP and GLP-1 receptors. Tirzepatide has high affinity to 
both the GIP and GLP-1 receptors. The activity of tirzepatide on the GIP receptor is similar to native 
GIP hormone. The activity of tirzepatide on the GLP-1 receptor is lower compared to native GLP-1 
hormone.  
Glycaemic control 
Tirzepatide improves glycaemic control by lowering fasting and postprandial glucose concentrations 
in patients with type 2 diabetes through several mechanisms. 
Appetite regulation and energy metabolism 
Tirzepatide lowers body weight and body fat mass. The mechanisms associated with body weight and 
body fat mass reduction involve decreased food intake through the regulation of appetite. Clinical 
studies show that tirzepatide reduces energy intake and appetite by increasing feelings of satiety and 
fullness, and decreasing feelings of hunger. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Insulin secretion 
Tirzepatide increases pancreatic β-cell glucose sensitivity. It enhances first- and second-phase insulin 
secretion in a glucose dependent manner.  
In a hyperglycaemic clamp study in patients with type 2 diabetes, tirzepatide was compared to placebo 
and the selective GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide 1 mg for insulin secretion. Tirzepatide 15 mg 
enhanced the first and second-phase insulin secretion rate by 466 % and 302 % from baseline, 
respectively. There was no change in first- and second-phase insulin secretion rate for 
placebo. 
Insulin sensitivity 
Tirzepatide improves insulin sensitivity. 
Tirzepatide 15 mg improved whole body insulin sensitivity by 63 %, as measured by M-value, a 
measure of glucose tissue uptake using hyperinsulinemic euglycaemic clamp. The M-value was 
unchanged for placebo.  
Tirzepatide lowers body weight in patients with obesity and overweight, and in patients with type 2 
diabetes (irrespective of body weight), which may contribute to improvement in insulin sensitivity. 
Reduced food intake with tirzepatide contributes to body weight loss. The body weight reduction is 
mostly due to reduced fat mass. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Glucagon concentration 
Tirzepatide reduced the fasting and postprandial glucagon concentrations in a glucose dependent 
manner. Tirzepatide 15 mg reduced fasting glucagon concentration by 28 % and glucagon AUC after a 
mixed meal by 43 %, compared with no change for placebo.   
Gastric emptying 
Tirzepatide delays gastric emptying which may slow post meal glucose absorption and can lead to a 
beneficial effect on postprandial glycaemia. Tirzepatide induced delay in gastric emptying diminishes 
over time. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Type 2 diabetes mellitus 
The safety and efficacy of tirzepatide were evaluated in five global randomised, controlled, phase 3 
studies (SURPASS 1-5) assessing glycaemic control as the primary objective. The studies involved 
6 263 treated patients with type 2 diabetes (4 199 treated with tirzepatide). The secondary objectives 
included body weight, percentage of patients achieving weight reduction targets, fasting serum glucose 
(FSG) and percentage of patients reaching target HbA1c. All five phase 3 studies assessed tirzepatide 
5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg. All patients treated with tirzepatide started with 2.5 mg for 4 weeks. Then the 
dose of tirzepatide was increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks until they reached their assigned dose.  
Across all studies, treatment with tirzepatide demonstrated sustained, statistically significant and 
clinically meaningful reductions from baseline in HbA1c as the primary objective compared to either 
placebo or active control treatment (semaglutide, insulin degludec and insulin glargine) for up to 
1 year. In 1 study these effects were sustained for up to 2 years. Statistically significant and clinically 
meaningful reductions from baseline in body weight were also demonstrated. Results from the phase 3 
studies are presented below based on the on-treatment data without rescue therapy in the modified 
intent-to-treat (mITT) population consisting of all randomly assigned patients who were exposed to at 
least 1 dose of study treatment, excluding patients discontinuing study treatment due to inadvertent 
enrolment.  
SURPASS-1 – Monotherapy 
In a 40 week double blind placebo-controlled study, 478 patients with inadequate glycaemic control 
with diet and exercise, were randomised to tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg once weekly or placebo. 
Patients had a mean age of 54 years and 52 % were men. At baseline the patients had a mean duration 
of diabetes of 5 years and the mean BMI was 32 kg/m2.

SURPASS-4 – Combination therapy with 1-3 oral antidiabetic medicinal products: metformin, 
sulphonylureas or SGLT2i  
In an active-controlled open-label study of up to 104 weeks (primary endpoint at 52 weeks), 
2 002 patients with type 2 diabetes and increased cardiovascular risk were randomised to tirzepatide 
5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg once weekly or insulin glargine once daily on a background of metformin 
(95 %) and/or sulphonylureas (54 %) and/or SGLT2i (25 %). At baseline the patients had a mean 
duration of diabetes of 12 years, a mean BMI of 33 kg/m2, a mean age of 64 years and 63 % were men. 
Patients treated with insulin glargine started at a dose of 10 U/day which was adjusted using an 
algorithm with a fasting blood glucose target of < 5.6 mmol/L. The mean dose of insulin glargine at 
week 52 was 44 units/day.

In a 40 week double-blind placebo-controlled study, 475 patients with inadequate glycaemic control 
using insulin glargine with or without metformin were randomised to tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg or 
15 mg once weekly or placebo. Insulin glargine doses were adjusted utilizing an algorithm with a 
fasting blood glucose target of < 5.6 mmol/L. At baseline the patients had a mean duration of diabetes 
of 13 years, a mean BMI of 33 kg/m2, a mean age of 61 years and 56 % were men. The overall 
estimated median dose of insulin glargine at baseline was 34 units/day. The median dose of insulin 
glargine at week 40 was 38, 36, 29 and 59 units/day for tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and placebo 
respectively.

Weight management 
The efficacy and safety of tirzepatide for weight management, in combination with a reduced calorie 
intake and increased physical activity, in patients with obesity (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2), or overweight 
(BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 to < 30 kg/m2) and at least one weight-related comorbidity, without diabetes

mellitus, were evaluated in a randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled phase 3 study 
(SURMOUNT-1).  
Treatment with tirzepatide demonstrated clinically meaningful and sustained (up to 72 weeks) weight 
reduction compared with placebo. Furthermore, in SURMOUNT-1, a higher percentage of patients 
achieved ≥ 5 %, ≥ 10 %, ≥ 15 % and ≥ 20 % weight loss with tirzepatide compared with placebo.  
The efficacy and safety of tirzepatide for weight management in patients with type 2 diabetes were 
evaluated in a subpopulation of patients with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 in five randomized phase 3 studies 
(SURPASS-1 to -5). A total of 5 392 patients with BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 (3 626 randomized to treatment 
with tirzepatide) were included in these studies. Subgroup analyses of patients with obesity or 
overweight in the SURPASS studies (amounting to 86 % of the overall SURPASS-1 to -5 population) 
showed weight reduction sustained (up to 52 weeks), and a higher percentage of patients achieving 
weight reduction targets compared to active comparator/placebo.  
SURMOUNT-1  
In a 72 week double blind placebo-controlled study, 2 539 adult patients with obesity (BMI ≥ 
30 kg/m2) or with overweight (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 to < 30 kg/m2) and at least one weight-related 
comorbid condition, such as treated or untreated dyslipidaemia, hypertension, obstructive sleep 
apnoea, or cardiovascular disease, were randomised to tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg or 15 mg once weekly 
or placebo.  Patients treated with tirzepatide started with 2.5 mg for 4 weeks. The dose of tirzepatide 
was increased by 2.5 mg every 4 weeks until patients reached their assigned dose. Patients with type 2 
diabetes mellitus were excluded. Patients had a mean age of 45 years and 67.5 % were women. At 
baseline 40.6 % of patients had prediabetes. Mean baseline body weight was 104.8 kg and mean BMI 
was 38 kg/m2.

Figure 6. Mean change in body weight (%) from baseline to week 72 
In SURMOUNT-1, pooled doses of tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg led to a significant 
improvement compared to placebo in systolic blood pressure (-8.1 mmHg vs. -1.3 mmHg), 
triglycerides (-27.6 % vs. -6.3 %), non-HDL-C (-11.3 % vs. -1.8 %), HDL-C (7.9 % vs. 0.3 %), and 
fasting insulin (-46.9 % vs. -9.7 %). 
Among the patients in SURMOUNT-1 with prediabetes at baseline (N = 1032), 95.3 % patients 
treated with tirzepatide reverted to normoglycemia at week 72, as compared with 61.9 % of patients in 
the placebo group. 
Effect on body composition 
Changes in body composition were evaluated in a sub-study in SURMOUNT-1 using dual energy 
X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA). The results of the DEXA assessment showed that treatment with 
tirzepatide was accompanied by greater reduction in fat mass than in lean body mass leading to an 
improvement in body composition compared to placebo after 72 weeks. Furthermore, this reduction in 
total fat mass was accompanied by a reduction in visceral fat. These results suggest that most of the 
total weight loss was attributable to a reduction in fat tissue, including visceral fat.  
Improvement in physical functioning 
Patients with obesity or overweight without diabetes who received tirzepatide showed small 
improvements in health-related quality of life, including physical functioning. The improvements were 
greater in the tirzepatide-treated patients than in those who received placebo. Health-related quality of 
life was assessed using the generic questionnaire Short Form-36v2 Health Survey Acute, Version 
(SF-36v2).  
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cardiovascular evaluation 
Cardiovascular (CV) risk was assessed via a meta-analysis of patients with at least one adjudication 
confirmed major adverse cardiac event (MACE). The composite endpoint of MACE-4 included 
CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalisation for unstable angina. 
In a primary meta-analysis of phase 2 and 3 registration studies in patients with type 2 diabetes,  a total 
of 116 patients (tirzepatide: 60 [n = 4 410]; all comparators: 56 [n = 2 169]) experienced at least one 
adjudication confirmed MACE-4: The results showed that tirzepatide was not associated with excess 
risk for CV events compared with pooled comparators (HR: 0.81; CI: 0.52 to 1.26). 
An additional analysis was conducted specifically for the SURPASS-4 study that enrolled patients 
with established CV disease. A total of 109 patients (tirzepatide: 47 [n = 995]; insulin glargine: 
62 [n = 1 000]) experienced at least one adjudication confirmed MACE-4: The results showed that 
tirzepatide was not associated with excess risk for CV events compared with insulin glargine 
(HR: 0.74; CI: 0.51 to 1.08). 
In addition, analysis was conducted for the SURMOUNT-1 study. A total of 14 patients (tirzepatide: 
9 [n = 1 896]; placebo:5 [n = 643]) experienced at least one adjudication confirmed MACE: the event 
rate was similar across placebo and tirzepatide 5 mg and 10 mg groups. There was no event in 
tirzepatide 15 mg group. 
Blood pressure 
In the placebo-controlled phase 3 studies in patients with T2DM, treatment with tirzepatide resulted in 
a mean decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 6 to 9 mmHg and 3 to 4 mmHg, 
respectively. There was a mean decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure of 2 mmHg each in 
placebo treated patients.  
In the 72 week placebo-controlled phase 3 study in patients with obesity or overweight without 
T2DM, treatment with tirzepatide resulted in a mean decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
of 7 to 8 mmHg and 5 to 6 mmHg, respectively. There was a mean decrease in systolic and diastolic 
blood pressure of 1 mmHg each in placebo treated patients.  
Other information 
Fasting serum glucose  
Across SURPASS-1 to -5 trials, treatment with tirzepatide resulted in significant reductions from 
baseline in FSG (changes from baseline to primary end point were -2.4 mmol/L to -3.8 mmol/L). 
Significant reductions from baseline in FSG could be observed as early as 2 weeks. Further 
improvement in FSG was seen through to 42 weeks then was sustained through the longest study 
duration of 104 weeks.  
Postprandial glucose 
Across SURPASS-1 to -5 trials, treatment with tirzepatide resulted in significant reductions in mean 
2 hour post prandial glucose (mean of 3 main meals of the day) from baseline (changes from baseline 
to primary end point were -3.35 mmol/L to -4.85 mmol/L). 
Triglycerides 
Across SURPASS1 to -5 trials, tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg resulted in reduction in serum 
triglyceride of 15-19 %, 18-27 % and 21-25 % respectively.  
In the 40 week trial versus semaglutide 1 mg, tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg resulted in 19 %, 
24 % and 25 % reduction in serum triglycerides levels respectively compared to 12 % reduction with 
semaglutide 1 mg. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the 72 week placebo-controlled phase 3 study in patients with obesity or overweight without 
T2DM, treatment with tirzepatide 5 mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg resulted in 24 %, 27 % and 31 % reduction 
in serum triglyceride levels respectively compared to 6 % reduction with placebo.  
Proportion of patients reaching HbA1c < 5.7 % without clinically significant hypoglycaemia 
In the 4 studies where tirzepatide was not combined with basal insulin (SURPASS-1 to -4), 93.6 % to 
100 % of patients who achieved a normal glycaemia of HbA1c < 5.7 % (≤ 39 mmol/mol), at the 
primary endpoint visit with tirzepatide treatment did so without clinically significant hypoglycaemia. 
In Study SURPASS-5, 85.9 % of patients treated with tirzepatide who reached HbA1c < 5.7 % 
(≤ 39 mmol/mol) did so without clinically significant hypoglycaemia. 
Special populations 
The efficacy of tirzepatide for the treatment of T2DM was not impacted by age, gender, race, 
ethnicity, region, or by baseline BMI, HbA1c, diabetes duration and level of renal function 
impairment. 
The efficacy of tirzepatide for weight management was not impacted by age, gender, race, ethnicity, 
region, baseline BMI, and presence or absence of prediabetes. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Mounjaro in one or more subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of type 2 diabetes 
mellitus and for weight management (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Tirzepatide consists of 39-amino acids  and has a C20 fatty diacid moiety attached, which enables 
albumin binding and prolongs half-life.  
Absorption 
Maximum concentration of tirzepatide is reached 8 to 72 hours post dose. Steady state exposure is 
achieved following 4 weeks of once weekly administration. Tirzepatide exposure increases in a dose 
proportional manner.  
Similar exposure was achieved with subcutaneous administration of tirzepatide in the abdomen, thigh, 
or upper arm.  
Absolute bioavailability of subcutaneous tirzepatide was 80 %. 
Distribution 
The mean apparent steady-state volume of distribution of tirzepatide following subcutaneous 
administration in patients with type 2 diabetes is approximately 10.3 L, and 9.7 L in patients with 
obesity. 
Tirzepatide is highly bound to plasma albumin (99 %). 
Biotransformation  
Tirzepatide is metabolised by proteolytic cleavage of the peptide backbone, beta-oxidation of the 
C20 fatty diacid moiety and amide hydrolysis. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elimination 
The apparent population mean clearance of tirzepatide is approximately 0.06 L/h with an elimination 
half-life of approximately 5 days, enabling once weekly administration. 
Tirzepatide is eliminated by metabolism. The primary excretion routes of tirzepatide metabolites are 
via urine and faeces. Intact tirzepatide is not observed in urine or faeces. 
Special populations 
Age, gender, race, ethnicity, body weight 
Age, gender, race, ethnicity, or body weight, do not have a clinically relevant effect on the 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of tirzepatide. Based on a population PK analysis, the exposure of tirzepatide 
increases with decreasing body weight; however, the effect of body weight on the PK of tirzepatide 
does not appear to be clinically relevant. 
Renal impairment 
Renal impairment does not impact the PK of tirzepatide. The PK of tirzepatide after a single 5 mg 
dose was evaluated in patients with different degrees of renal impairment (mild, moderate, severe, 
ESRD) compared with subjects with normal renal function and no clinically relevant differences were 
observed. This was also shown for patients with both type 2 diabetes mellitus and renal impairment 
based on data from clinical studies.  
Hepatic impairment 
Hepatic impairment does not impact the PK of tirzepatide. The PK of tirzepatide after a single 5 mg 
dose was evaluated in patients with different degrees of hepatic impairment (mild, moderate, severe) 
compared with subjects with normal hepatic function and no clinically relevant differences were 
observed.   
Paediatric population 
Tirzepatide has not been studied in paediatric patients. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology or repeat-dose toxicity or genotoxicity. 
A 2-year carcinogenicity study was conducted with tirzepatide in male and female rats at doses of 
0.15, 0.50, and 1.5 mg/kg (0.12, 0.36, and 1.02-fold the maximum recommended human dose 
(MRHD) based on AUC) administered by subcutaneous injection twice weekly. Tirzepatide caused an 
increase in thyroid C-cell tumours (adenomas and carcinomas) at all doses compared to controls. The 
human relevance of these findings is unknown. 
In a 6-month carcinogenicity study in rasH2 transgenic mice, tirzepatide at doses of 1, 3, and 10 mg/kg 
administered by subcutaneous injection twice weekly did not produce increased incidences of thyroid 
C-cell hyperplasia or neoplasia at any dose. 
Animal studies with tirzepatide did not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to fertility.  
In animal reproduction studies, tirzepatide caused foetal growth reductions and foetal abnormalities at 
exposures below the MRHD based on AUC. An increased incidence of external, visceral, and skeletal 
malformations and visceral and skeletal developmental variations were observed in rats. Foetal growth 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reductions were observed in rats and rabbits. All developmental effects occurred at maternally toxic 
doses.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Mounjaro is and what it is used for 
Mounjaro contains an active substance called tirzepatide and is used to treat adults with type 2 
diabetes mellitus. Mounjaro reduces the level of sugar in the body only when the levels of sugar are 
high.  
Mounjaro is also used to treat adults with obesity or overweight (with BMI of at least 27 kg/m2). 
Mounjaro influences appetite regulation, which may help you eat less food and reduce your body 
weight. 
In type 2 diabetes, Mounjaro is used: 
- 
- 
on its own when you can’t take metformin (another diabetes medicine). 
with other medicines for diabetes when they are not enough to control your blood sugar levels. 
These other medicines may be medicines taken by mouth and/or insulin given by injection. 
Mounjaro is also used together with diet and exercise for weight loss and to help keep the weight 
under control in adults, who have: 
- 
- 
a BMI of 30 kg/m² or greater (obesity) or  
a BMI of at least 27 kg/m² but less than 30 kg/m² (overweight) and weight-related health 
problems (such as prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, abnormal levels of fats in 
the blood, breathing problems during sleep called ‘obstructive sleep apnoea’ or a history of 
heart attack, stroke or blood vessel problems) 
BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure of your weight in relation to your height. 
124 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is important to continue to follow the advice on diet and exercise given to you by your doctor, nurse 
or pharmacist. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Mounjaro 
Do not use Mounjaro  
- 
if you are allergic to tirzepatide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  
Warnings and precautions   
Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before using Mounjaro if: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
you have severe problems with food digestion or food remaining in your stomach for longer 
than normal (including severe gastroparesis). 
you have ever had pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas which may cause severe pain in 
the stomach and back which does not go away). 
you have a problem with your eyes (diabetic retinopathy or macular oedema). 
you are using a sulphonylurea (another diabetes medicine) or insulin for your diabetes, as low 
blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can occur. Your doctor may need to change your dose of these 
other medicines to reduce this risk. 
When starting treatment with Mounjaro, in some cases you may experience loss of fluids/dehydration, 
e.g. due to vomiting, nausea and/or diarrhoea, which may lead to a decrease in kidney function. It is 
important to avoid dehydration by drinking plenty of fluids. Contact your doctor if you have any 
questions or concerns. 
Children and adolescents  
This medicine should not be given to children and adolescents under 18 years of age because it has not 
been studied in this age group. 
Other medicines and Mounjaro  
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other 
medicines. 
Pregnancy  
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before using this medicine. This medicine should not be used during pregnancy as the effects of 
this medicine on an unborn child are not known. Therefore, it is recommended to use contraception 
while using this medicine. 
Breast-feeding  
It is unknown whether tirzepatide passes into breast milk. A risk to newborns/infants cannot be ruled 
out. If you are breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed, talk to your doctor before using this 
medicine. You and your doctor should decide if you should stop breast-feeding or delay using 
Mounjaro. 
Driving and using machines  
It is unlikely that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines. However, if you use 
Mounjaro in combination with a sulphonylurea or insulin, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may 
occur which may reduce your ability to concentrate. Avoid driving or using machines if you get any 
signs of low blood sugar, e.g. headache, drowsiness, weakness, dizziness, feeling hungry, confusion, 
irritability, fast heartbeat and sweating (see section 4). See section 2, ‘Warnings and precautions’ for 
information on increased risk of low blood sugar. Talk to your doctor for further information. 
125 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mounjaro contains sodium  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to use Mounjaro 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure how to use this medicine. 
How much to use 
• 
• 
The starting dose is 2.5 mg once a week for four weeks. After four weeks your doctor will 
increase your dose to 5 mg once a week.  
Your doctor may increase your dose by 2.5 mg increments to 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 12.5 mg or 
15 mg once a week if you need it. In each case your doctor will tell you to stay on a particular 
dose for at least 4 weeks before going to a higher dose. 
Do not change your dose unless your doctor has told you to. 
Each pen contains one dose of Mounjaro either 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 12.5 mg, or 15 mg.  
Choosing when to use Mounjaro  
You can use your pen at any time of the day, with or without meals. You should use it on the same day 
each week if you can. To help you remember, when to use Mounjaro, you may wish to tick the day of 
the week when you inject your first dose on the box that your pen comes in, or mark it on a calendar. 
If necessary, you can change the day of your weekly Mounjaro injection, as long as it has been at least 
3 days since your last injection. After selecting a new dosing day, continue with once-a-week dosing 
on that new day. 
How to inject Mounjaro  
Mounjaro is injected under the skin (subcutaneous injection) of your stomach area (abdomen) or upper 
leg (thigh) or upper arm. You may need help from someone else if you want to inject in your upper 
arm. 
If you want to do so, you can use the same area of your body each week. But be sure to choose a 
different injection site within that area. If you also inject insulin choose a different injection site for 
that injection. 
Read the “Instructions for Use” for the pen carefully before using Mounjaro. 
Testing blood glucose levels  
If you are using Mounjaro with a sulphonylurea or insulin, it is important that you test your blood 
glucose levels as instructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist (see section 2, ‘Warnings and 
precautions’). 
If you use more Mounjaro than you should  
If you use more Mounjaro than you should talk to your doctor immediately. Too much of this 
medicine may cause low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) and can make you feel sick or be sick. 
If you forget to use Mounjaro  
If you forget to inject a dose and,  
• 
it has been 4 days or less since you should have used Mounjaro, use it as soon as you 
remember. Then inject your next dose as usual on your scheduled day. 
If it has been more than 4 days since you should have used Mounjaro, skip the missed dose. 
Then inject your next dose as usual on your scheduled day. 
• 
126 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. The minimum time between two doses must 
be at least 3 days. 
If you stop using Mounjaro  
Do not stop using Mounjaro without talking with your doctor. If you stop using Mounjaro, and you 
have type 2 diabetes, your blood sugar levels can increase. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1. 
What Mounjaro is and what it is used for 
Mounjaro contains an active substance called tirzepatide and is used to treat adults with type 2 
diabetes mellitus. Mounjaro reduces the level of sugar in the body only when the levels of sugar are 
high.  
Mounjaro is also used to treat adults with obesity or overweight (with BMI of at least 27 kg/m2). 
Mounjaro influences appetite regulation, which may help you eat less food and reduce your body 
weight. 
In type 2 diabetes, Mounjaro is used: 
- 
- 
on its own when you can’t take metformin (another diabetes medicine). 
with other medicines for diabetes when they are not enough to control your blood sugar levels. 
These other medicines may be medicines taken by mouth and/or insulin given by injection. 
Mounjaro is also used together with diet and exercise for weight loss and to help keep the weight 
under control in adults, who have: 
- 
- 
a BMI of 30 kg/m² or greater (obesity) or  
a BMI of at least 27 kg/m² but less than 30 kg/m² (overweight) and weight-related health 
problems (such as prediabetes, type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, abnormal levels of fats in 
the blood, breathing problems during sleep called ‘obstructive sleep apnoea’ or a history of 
heart attack, stroke or blood vessel problems) 
136 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
BMI (Body Mass Index) is a measure of your weight in relation to your height. 
It is important to continue to follow the advice on diet and exercise given to you by your doctor, nurse 
or pharmacist. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Mounjaro 
Do not use Mounjaro  
- 
if you are allergic to tirzepatide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  
Warnings and precautions   
Talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist before using Mounjaro if: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
you have severe problems with food digestion or food remaining in your stomach for longer 
than normal (including severe gastroparesis). 
you have ever had pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas which may cause severe pain in 
the stomach and back which does not go away). 
you have a problem with your eyes (diabetic retinopathy or macular oedema). 
you are using a sulphonylurea (another diabetes medicine) or insulin for your diabetes, as low 
blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) can occur. Your doctor may need to change your dose of these 
other medicines to reduce this risk. 
When starting treatment with Mounjaro, in some cases you may experience loss of fluids/dehydration, 
e.g. due to vomiting, nausea and/or diarrhoea, which may lead to a decrease in kidney function. It is 
important to avoid dehydration by drinking plenty of fluids. Contact your doctor if you have any 
questions or concerns. 
Children and adolescents  
This medicine should not be given to children and adolescents under 18 years of age because it has not 
been studied in this age group. 
Other medicines and Mounjaro  
Tell your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are using, have recently used or might use any other 
medicines. 
Pregnancy  
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor for 
advice before using this medicine. This medicine should not be used during pregnancy as the effects of 
this medicine on an unborn child are not known. Therefore, it is recommended to use contraception 
while using this medicine. 
Breast-feeding  
It is unknown whether tirzepatide passes into breast milk. A risk to newborns/infants cannot be ruled 
out. If you are breast-feeding or are planning to breast-feed, talk to your doctor before using this 
medicine. You and your doctor should decide if you should stop breast-feeding or delay using 
Mounjaro. 
Driving and using machines  
It is unlikely that this medicine will affect your ability to drive and use machines. However, if you use 
Mounjaro in combination with a sulphonylurea or insulin, low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) may 
occur which may reduce your ability to concentrate. Avoid driving or using machines if you get any 
signs of low blood sugar, e.g. headache, drowsiness, weakness, dizziness, feeling hungry, confusion, 
irritability, fast heartbeat and sweating (see section 4). See section 2, ‘Warnings and precautions’ for 
information on increased risk of low blood sugar. Talk to your doctor for further information. 
137 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mounjaro contains sodium  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to use Mounjaro 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure how to use this medicine. 
How much to use 
• 
• 
The starting dose is 2.5 mg once a week for four weeks. After four weeks your doctor will 
increase your dose to 5 mg once a week.  
Your doctor may increase your dose by 2.5 mg increments to 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 12.5 mg or 
15 mg once a week if you need it. In each case your doctor will tell you to stay on a particular 
dose for at least 4 weeks before going to a higher dose. 
Do not change your dose unless your doctor has told you to. 
Each vial contains one dose of Mounjaro either 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 12.5 mg, or 15 mg.  
Choosing when to use Mounjaro  
You can use Mounjaro at any time of the day, with or without meals. You should use it on the same 
day each week if you can. To help you remember when to use Mounjaro, you may wish to mark on a 
calendar the day of the week when you inject your first dose. 
If necessary, you can change the day of your weekly Mounjaro injection, as long as it has been at least 
3 days since your last injection. After selecting a new dosing day, continue with once-a-week dosing 
on that new day. 
How to inject Mounjaro  
Always use Mounjaro exactly as your doctor has told you. Before you begin using Mounjaro, always 
read the “Instructions for Use” below carefully, and talk to your doctor, nurse or pharmacist if you are 
not sure about how to inject Mounjaro correctly. 
Mounjaro is injected under the skin (subcutaneous injection) of your stomach area (abdomen) or upper 
leg (thigh) or upper arm. You may need help from someone else if you want to inject in your upper 
arm. Do not inject Mounjaro directly into a vein, as this will change its action. 
If you want to do so, you can use the same area of your body each week. But be sure to choose a 
different injection site within that area. If you also inject insulin choose a different injection site for 
that injection. If you are blind or visually impaired, you will need help from someone to make your 
injection. 
Instructions for Use 
1.  First wash your hands with soap and water. 
2.  Check that the Mounjaro in the vial looks clear and colourless to slightly yellow. Do not use if it is 
frozen, cloudy, or has particles in it. 
3.  Pull off the vial plastic protective cap, but do not remove the stopper. Clean the stopper on the vial 
with a swab and prepare a new syringe. Do not share or reuse your needle or syringe.  
4.  Draw a small amount of air into the syringe. Put the needle through the rubber stopper on top of the 
Mounjaro vial and inject the air into the vial. 
5.  Turn the Mounjaro vial and the syringe upside down and slowly pull the syringe plunger down to 
withdraw all the Mounjaro solution from the vial.  The vial is filled to enable delivery of a single 
0.5 ml dose of Mounjaro.  
6.  If there are air bubbles in the syringe, tap the syringe gently a few times to let any air bubbles rise 
to the top. Slowly push the plunger up until there is no more air in the syringe. 
138 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
7.  Pull the syringe out of the vial stopper.   
8.  Before you make an injection, clean your skin. 
9.  Gently pinch and hold a fold of skin where you will inject. 
10. Inject under the skin, as you have been instructed. Inject all the solution from the syringe to receive 
a full dose. After your injection, the needle should stay under your skin for 5 seconds to make sure 
you receive the full dose.  
11. Pull the needle out of your skin. 
12. Throw away the vial, used needle and syringe immediately after each injection in a puncture 
resistant container, or as instructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. 
Testing blood glucose levels   
If you are using Mounjaro with a sulphonylurea or insulin, it is important that you test your blood 
glucose levels as instructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist (see section 2, ‘Warnings and 
precautions’). 
If you use more Mounjaro than you should 
If you use more Mounjaro than you should talk to your doctor immediately. Too much of this 
medicine may cause low blood sugar (hypoglycaemia) and can make you feel sick or be sick. 
If you forget to use Mounjaro  
If you forget to inject a dose and,  
• 
it has been 4 days or less since you should have used Mounjaro, use it as soon as you 
remember. Then inject your next dose as usual on your scheduled day. 
If it has been more than 4 days since you should have used Mounjaro, skip the missed dose. 
Then inject your next dose as usual on your scheduled day. 
• 
Do not use a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. The minimum time between two doses must 
be at least 3 days. 
If you stop using Mounjaro  
Do not stop using Mounjaro without talking with your doctor. If you stop using Mounjaro, and you 
have type 2 diabetes, your blood sugar levels can increase. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, nurse or pharmacist.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Tesaro UK Limited submitted on 4 October 2016 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Zejula, through the centralised 
procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The 
eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 25 June 2015. 
Zejula was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/10/760 on 4 August 2010 in the 
following condition: treatment of ovarian cancer. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
Zejula is indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive 
recurrent high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are 
in response (complete response or partial response) to platinum-based chemotherapy. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Zejula as an orphan medicinal product in 
the approved indication. The outcome of the COMP review can be found on the Agency's website: 
ema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Human medicines/Rare disease designation. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated 
that niraparib was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
CW/1/2011 on the granting of a class waiver.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) 
No 847/2000, the applicant did submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance niraparib contained in the above medicinal product to 
be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a 
medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed therapeutic indication is: “Zejula is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance 
treatment of adult patients with platinum sensitive relapsed high grade serous epithelial ovarian, 
fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) to platinum  
based chemotherapy ”. 
Platinum sensitivity was defined by complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) for more than 
six months to their penultimate (next to last) platinum-based therapy. To be eligible for niraparib 
treatment the patient should be in response (CR or PR) following completion of last platinum based 
chemotherapy. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Ovarian cancer is the deadliest of gynaecologic cancers; in women, it is the fifth overall cause of 
cancer-related deaths representing 5% of all such deaths [Siegel et al 2014]. In 2016, it was 
estimated that there would be 22,280 new cases of ovarian cancer and an estimated 14,240 
women would die of this disease in the US [NCI, 2016]. In 2012 (the latest data available), 42,716 
died in Europe from ovarian cancer [IARC, 2012]. 
Ovarian cancer is predominantly a disease of postmenopausal women with the majority (>80%) of 
cases being diagnosed in women over 50 years and the median age at diagnosis being 63 years.  
First-line treatment regimens result in high response rates, but most patients with advanced 
disease will recur within 2 years. The median PFS in the front-line setting is approximately 16 to 18 
months from initiation of platinum-based chemotherapy [Coleman et al 2013]. Relapse rates for 
epithelial ovarian cancer are 62% overall, but can be as high as approximately 85% for patients 
diagnosed with advanced disease [Birrer et al 2016]. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Platinum predominantly causes large-scale DNA intra-strand cross-links which require a competent 
homologous recombination pathway for effective repair. Given that platinum sensitivity and PARP 
inhibitor sensitivity may converge at the homologous recombination pathway, it was possible that 
platinum responsiveness may be also enrich for PARP inhibitor sensitivity [Mukhopadhyay et al 
2010]. Clinical data support this hypothesis, platinum sensitive tumours are more sensitive to PARP 
inhibitors than platinum resistant tumours [Matulonis et al 2016]. Thus, while BRCA mutations and 
HRD might represent biological markers of sensitivity to PARP inhibitors, platinum responsiveness 
may be a clinical indicator of sensitivity to these compounds. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Early stage ovarian cancer is often asymptomatic and therefore difficult to detect. For women who 
do experience symptoms in the early stages, ovarian cancer is sometimes misdiagnosed because 
the majority of symptoms are nonspecific. These symptoms may overlap those of gastrointestinal 
and other diseases, and as a result, many patients may be treated incorrectly for months or years. 
Thus, ovarian cancer is often first detected in advanced stages when prognosis is poor.  
Assessment report  
EMA/648982/2017 
Page 9/122 
  
  
The 5-year overall survival rate of ovarian cancer patients is 46% across all stages and only 29% 
in patients diagnosed with distant metastatic disease. Most patients will die within 3 to 4 years of 
diagnosis [Coleman et al 2013]. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The majority of patients with ovarian cancer receive surgery to remove or debulk the tumour. The 
primary treatment of advanced-stage ovarian cancer in the first-line setting is platinum (cisplatin 
or carboplatin) plus a taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel) with or without bevacizumab. However, 
platinum-based chemotherapy can cause serious side effects this may negatively impact patients’ 
ability to lead a productive life. 
Once a patient has recurrence of their ovarian cancer, chemotherapy is an option for reducing 
disease-related symptoms. Both the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and European 
Society for Medical Oncology guidelines recommend re-treatment of patients with a platinum-based 
combination chemotherapy when relapse occurs >6 months after initial platinum-based treatment. 
The treatment options for patients with prior platinum-sensitive relapsed ovarian cancer are 
described below: 
• 
Following response to second-line chemotherapy, one of the options per NCCN and ESMO 
guidelines is to monitor for disease progression while managing the patient’s symptoms 
and providing no active anti-cancer treatment. Importantly, patients during the 
surveillance period are not asymptomatic as they continue to have signs and symptoms 
associated with their underlying ovarian cancer as well as residual side effects of their prior 
chemotherapy. Further, during the observation period ovarian cancer survivors report 
emotional problems, including psychological distress (40%), anxiety about CA-125 testing 
(54%), and fear of recurrence (56%); 26% had scores suggestive of post-traumatic stress 
disorder [Ferrell et al 2003]. The primary challenge with this approach is that the duration 
of the chemotherapy-free interval after platinum therapy is short and becomes 
progressively shorter; therefore, these patients will inevitably require retreatment with 
platinum-based chemotherapy. 
•  Bevacizumab is approved in the EU for patients with recurrent ovarian cancer in 
combination with chemotherapy with continuation as maintenance after 6 cycles of 
combination. Bevacizumab in combination with gemcitabine plus carboplatin improved 
median PFS by 4 months compared to gemcitabine plus carboplatin alone in patients with 
platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer [Aghajanian et al 2012]. Of note, as 
bevacizumab is initiated at the time of platinum-based chemotherapy, the reported PFS 
interval includes the time during which the patient is receiving platinum-based 
chemotherapy (~4.5 months). Importantly, for patients who received bevacizumab in the 
first-line setting, this therapy is not an option for this patient group which have platinum-
sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. 
•  Olaparib was approved in the EU as maintenance monotherapy for patients with platinum-
sensitive, relapsed, ovarian cancer with a BRCA mutation (either germline or tumour) who 
are in response (CR or PR) to platinum-based chemotherapy [Ledermann et al 2014]. 
Olaparib is not approved as maintenance treatment in the US, but was recently approved 
for treatment of patients who have had at least 3 prior treatment regimens for ovarian 
cancer. Median prolongation in PFS of olaparib maintenance treatment was 6.9 months 
(11.2 months in olaparib arm vs 4.3 months in placebo arm) for patients with the BRCA 
mutation. Recently, olaparib OS data after more than five years follow up have been 
published [Ledermann et al 2016], showing beneficial treatment effect in the olaparib arm

as compared to placebo for the gBRCA group of patients (HR 0.62 34.9 months in olaparib 
arm vs 30.2 months in placebo arm). 
About the product 
Niraparib is an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) enzymes, PARP-1 and PARP-2, 
which play a role in DNA repair. In vitro studies have shown that niraparib-induced cytotoxicity 
may involve inhibition of PARP enzymatic activity and increased formation of PARP-DNA complexes 
resulting in DNA damage, apoptosis and cell death. Increased niraparib-induced cytotoxicity was 
observed in tumour cell lines with or without deficiencies in the BReast CAncer (BRCA) 1 and 2 
tumour suppressor genes. In orthotopic high-grade serous ovarian cancer patient-derived 
xenograft tumours (PDX) grown in mice, niraparib has been shown to reduce tumour growth in 
BRCA 1 and 2 mutant, BRCA wild-type but homologous recombination (HR) deficient, and in 
tumours that are BRCA wild-type and without detectable HR deficiency (see section 5.1 of the 
SmPC).  
The indication for Zejula as initially proposed by the applicant was as follows: 
“Zejula is indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive 
recurrent high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are 
in response (complete response or partial response) to platinum-based chemotherapy.” 
The final indication as approved by the CHMP following review of the application is: 
“Zejula is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum 
sensitive relapsed high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer 
who are in response (complete or partial) to platinum based chemotherapy.” 
Treatment with Zejula should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of 
anticancer medicinal products. 
The dose is three 100 mg hard capsules once daily, equivalent to a total daily dose of 300 mg. The 
capsules should be swallowed whole with water. The capsules should not be chewed or crushed. 
Patients should be encouraged to take their dose at approximately the same time each day. 
Niraparib can be taken without regard to meals. Bedtime administration may be a potential method 
for managing nausea. 
It is recommended that treatment should be continued until disease progression. 
If patients miss a dose, they should take their next dose at its regularly scheduled time. 
Recommendations for the management of adverse reactions are provided in Table 1. In general, it 
is recommended to first interrupt the treatment (but no longer than 28 consecutive days) to allow 
the patient to recover from the adverse reaction and then restart at the same dose. In the case 
that the adverse reaction recurs, it is recommended to reduce the dose. If adverse reactions 
persist beyond a 28-day dose interruption, it is recommended that Zejula be discontinued. If 
adverse reactions are not manageable with this strategy of dose interruption and reduction, it is 
recommended that Zejula be discontinued. 
Dose reductions may be implemented based on adverse reactions. The recommended dose 
reductions are first from three hard capsules daily (300 mg) to two hard capsules daily 
(200 mg). If further dose reduction is needed, a second dose reduction from two hard capsules 
daily (200 mg) to one capsule daily (100 mg) may be implemented. 
The recommended dose modifications for adverse reactions are listed in Tables 1 and 2.

Dose modifications for haematologic adverse reactions 
Haematologic adverse reactions have been observed during the treatment with Zejula especially during the 
initial phase of the treatment. It is therefore recommended to monitor complete blood counts (CBCs) weekly 
during the first month of treatment and modify the dose as needed.After the first month, it is recommended 
to monitor CBCs monthly and periodically after this time (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). Based on individual 
laboratory values, weekly monitoring for the second month may be warranted.

monohydrate) as active substance.  
Other ingredients in the capsule content are magnesium stearate and lactose monohydrate. 
Ingredients of the capsule shell are: titanium dioxide (E 171), gelatin, brilliant blue FCF (E 133), 
erythrosine (E 127) and tartrazine (E 102). Ingredients of the printing ink are: shellac (E 904), 
propylene glycol (E 1520), potassium hydroxide (E 525), black iron oxide (E 172), sodium 
hydroxide (E 524) and povidone (E 1201). 
The product is available in Aclar/PVC/aluminium foil perforated unit dose blisters, as described in 
section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of niraparib tosylate monohydrate is 2-{4-[(3S)-piperidin-3-yl]phenyl}-2H-
indazole 7-carboxamide 4-methylbenzenesulfonate hydrate (1:1:1) corresponding to the molecular 
formula C19H20N4O · C7H8O3S · H2O. It has a relative molecular mass of 510.61 and the following 
structure:

Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of niraparib tosylate monohydrate was elucidated by a combination of 
nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-
MS), and single crystal X-ray crystallography with confirmatory data from elemental analysis, 
Fourier transform infra-red (FT-IR) spectroscopy, and ultraviolet (UV) spectroscopy. 
The active substance is a white to pale brown powder; it is non-hygroscopic, with low, pH 
independent solubility in aqueous media. Based on the high permeability, it is classified as BCS 
Class II compound. Due to low solubility, particle size distribution is controlled in the active 
substance specification. Particle size distribution supports product manufacturability and it is based 
on the analysis of batches used in the pivotal clinical study.  
Niraparib exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of a single chiral centre. The 
stereochemistry originates and is controlled in the synthesis. 
Polymorphism has been observed. The anhydrate form has been detected by DSC but is only 
formed at very high temperatures. The crystallization ensures routine production of the 
monohydrate form which is conformed routinely by XRPD. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Niraparib is synthesized from well-defined starting materials with acceptable specifications.  One 
starting material was red-defined during the procedure in response to a major objection from 
CHMP as not enough of the process has been included for the regulatory to understand the control 
and fate of impurities.  The revised process, along with impurity (including genotoxic impurities) 
fate and purge studies ensures that sufficient steps are included in the process description, and 
that the control strategy is adequate to ensure the quality of the active substance. Three 
manufacturers carry out the manufacture of the active substance. The active substance is 
synthesized in six main steps. 
Niraparib tosylate monohydrate is a genotoxic compound and is administrated to patients with 
advanced cancer at a daily dose of up to 300 mg. In accordance with Guidance for Industry: S9 
Nonclinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals, both the identification (0.10 %) and 
qualification thresholds (0.15 %) stated in ICH Q3A will be applied to niraparib impurities including 
other potential genotoxic impurities (PGIs). 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control 
methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU 
guideline on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.

The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development program. There have been three slightly different variations of the same 
synthetic route to manufacture niraparib tosylate monohydrate active substance. The synthetic 
approaches for Processes I to III all employ the same carbon-carbon bond and carbon-hetero bond 
formation steps. The order of some chemical transformations has varied between processes, as has 
the selection of isolated intermediates. Changes introduced have been presented in sufficient detail 
and have been justified. The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the 
development is considered to be comparable with that produced by the proposed commercial 
process. Active substance batches manufactured using Process III were used in clinical studies, as 
primary stability batches, and for commercial product. 
The manufacturing process has been developed using a combination of traditional and enhanced 
approach to pharmaceutical development, in line with ICH Q11 Guideline. The early development 
work in establishing the commercial route for niraparib synthesis primarily used the traditional 
approach to screen and select reagents, solvents, catalysts, and reaction temperature, as well as 
to optimize the process for early stage production. When appropriate, an enhanced approach, such 
as the use of statistical design of experiment and one variable at a time (OVAT) studies has been 
conducted to understand the sensitivity of the process to various parameters and ensure that the 
process is robust across the defined normal operating ranges (NORs), proven acceptable ranges 
(PARs) and critical process parameters (CPPs). Although aspects of enhanced approach to 
pharmaceutical development have been used, no design space or regulatory flexibility is applied 
for. 
The active substance is packaged in HMHDPE or ArmorFlex® 116 bags inside of LDPE bags.  All 
primary packaging material complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as 
amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance, identification, identification of 
toluene sulfonic acid (HPLC), assay (HPLC), achiral related impurities (HPLC), chiral impurity (chiral 
HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water content (KF), elemental impurities (ICP-MS), particle size 
(laser diffraction), solid form (XRPD) and residue on ignition/sulfated ash (gravimetric Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified 
by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding 
the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Analysis data from 22 commercial and pilot scale batches of the active substance are provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
The microbiological quality of three out of six registration batches of the active substance was 
consistently below 100 CFU/g (TAMC) and 10 CFU/g (TYMC) and given the oral route of 
administration, no routine test is required.  
Stability 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of active substance from each of the proposed 
manufacturers stored in the intended commercial package for up to 18 months under long term 
conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% 
RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.

The following parameters were tested: appearance, identification, assay, achiral related 
substances, chiral impurity, water content, particle size and solid form. The parameters tested are 
the same as for release. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were 
stability indicating. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on two batches showing that 
the active substance is not photosensitive.  Forced degradation studies were carried out by 
exposing the active substance to heat, light, acid, base and oxidative conditions. Niraparib tosylate 
monohydrate is stable in the solid state and did not show significant degradation in basic/acidic 
aqueous solutions but degrades in aqueous solution with an oxidant. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications. Stability data is representative for all suppliers 
and there are no differences in stability data between the active substance manufacturers. 
The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as hard capsules containing 100 mg of niraparib (as tosylate 
monohydrate) as active substance. The dimensions of hard capsules are approximately 22 mm x 
8 mm; they have a white body with “100 mg” printed in black ink and purple cap with “Niraparib” 
printed in white ink. 
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to deliver a robust formulation and manufacturing 
process with an appropriate control strategy that meets all aspects of the Target Product Profile 
(TPP) and the Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP).  
Pharmaceutical development of the finished product followed an enhanced approach with QbD 
elements.  
Niraparib tosylate monohydrate is classified as having low solubility based on the experimentally 
determined solubility over the pH range according to the BCS guidelines (BCS Class II).  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Compatibility of the active substance with the finished product excipients is demonstrated through 
ongoing stability studies 
A dissolution method was developed and validated for the release and stability testing of niraparib 
100 mg capsules. The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. 
The general process used to manufacture all niraparib clinical trial material and the commercial 
product has remained unchanged over the course of development. During the MAA review process, 
a development effort to further enhance the robustness of the commercial manufacturing process 
and optimize efficiency by targeting increasing yields was initiated.  
With the exception of capsule colour and ink printing, the niraparib 100 mg capsule composition 
has remained unchanged throughout clinical development and is identical to the intended 
Assessment report  
EMA/648982/2017

commercial formulation. A 10 mg capsule was developed and used during early clinical studies. 
This formulation contained the same excipients which differed in ratios compared to the 
formulation used in pivotal clinical trial and selected for commercialisation. 
The primary packaging is Aclar/PVC/aluminium foil perforated unit dose blisters. The material 
complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of four main steps: screening of components, blending, 
encapsulation and packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process.  
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of 
intended quality in a reproducible manner. Full scale validation activities will be completed prior to 
commercial launch in accordance with the site master validation plan and protocols which was 
found acceptable. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and 
pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form 
appearance  (visual),  identification  (FT-IR,  HPLC),  assay  (HPLC),  degradation  products  (HPLC), 
uniformity  of  dosage  units  (HPLC),  dissolution  (HPLC),  water  content  (KF),  elemental  impurities 
(ICP-MS) and microbial enumeration (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 18 commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of 
the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the approved release specifications, 
through traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  data  from  six  commercial  batches  of  finished  product  stored  for  up  to  12  months  under 
long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH), for up to 9 months at intermediate (30 ºC / 65% RH) and 
for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines 
were provided. The batches of medicinal product are identical to those proposed for marketing and 
were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging  proposed  for  marketing.  Data  on  batches  of  the  finished 
product  manufacturer  using  the  active  substance  by  different  suppliers  were  provided  (3  per 
supplier) in order to support their equivalence in terms of quality. 
Samples  were  tested  for  the  same  parameters  and  using  the  same  methods  as  for  release.  The 
analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
No significant changes have been observed for most of the tested parameters. Changes were 
observed for batches stored through to 6 months of storage at 40 °C/75 % RH as the known 
crosslinking within the hard gelatin capsule shell was observed at this accelerated condition. In 
accordance with ICH Q1E, failure to meet acceptance criteria for dissolution is not considered to be 
Assessment report  
EMA/648982/2017 
Page 17/122 
  
  
a significant change since it is unequivocally due to the cross-linking of the gelatin capsule. Since 
there was little or no change over time, statistical analysis of the data was deemed unnecessary. 
With the exception of crosslinking of the hard gelatin capsule shell, there were no significant 
physical and chemical changes to any other measured parameters and on efficacy and safety of the 
product when used according to the directions in the SmPC. 
In  addition,  a  single  batch  was  exposed  to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH  Guideline  on  Photostability 
Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. The data show no changes in the fully exposed test 
samples,  with  the  exception  of  dissolution  where  cross  linking,  a  known  phenomenon  for  gelatin 
capsules, was observed. Therefore, with the exception of gelatin capsule cross linking, there were 
no observed changes on stability and the niraparib 100 mg capsules do not require light protection. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life of 24 months and ‘do not store above 30 °C’, as 
stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Niraparib was evaluated in a series of biochemical and cell-based studies to determine its potency 
and selectivity against the PARP family of enzymes. Further, daily oral niraparib dosing was 
evaluated in cell line xenograft and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of ovarian cancer, as 
monotherapy, and in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy. Finally, niraparib-related 
effects on secondary pharmacological parameters and safety pharmacology endpoints were 
evaluated.

PARP inhibition in human HeLa cells (study PD002) 
Niraparib inhibited intracellular PARylation in HeLa human cervical cancer cells with an IC50 and 
IC90 of 4 and 37 nM, respectively. Similar results have been reported for niraparib in the A2780 
ovarian tumour cell line and in the BRCA-2mut CAPAN-1 pancreatic tumour cell line (Jones et al, 
2015). 
Table 6: Inhibition of PARylation in tumour cell lines (Jones et al, 2015) 
Niraparib functionally inhibits PARylation and single-stranded DNA break repair (study 
TSR2016082) 
Niraparib inhibited intracellular PARylation in Jurkat cells (human immortalised T lymphocytes) with 
an IC50 and IC90 of 22 and 56 nM, respectively. DNA repair was not inhibited until PAR levels were 
suppressed by approximately 90%.

Cell proliferation was selectively inhibited in cancer cell lines (uterine cervical, non-small cell lung, 
breast, pancreas) that were either BRCA-1- or BRCA-2 deficient (IC50 <74 nM), with ≥18-fold 
selectivity window over corresponding BRCAwt cell lines.  
Table 7: Niraparib selectively inhibits proliferation of BRCA-1-deficient HeLa and BRCA-2-
deficient A549 cells as compared to wild-type pairs 
Compared to BRCA-1/-2-deficient cancer cells, niraparib exhibited only weak anti-proliferative 
activity on normal human cells, including human renal, prostate, and mammary epithelial cells, 
with IC50s of ≥2.9 µM. 
Table 8: Activity of niraparib on normal epithelial cells 
 Niraparib and olaparib had similar effects on both erythroid and myeloid progenitors with an IC50 
of approximately 1 μM in each of the tested cell populations.  
Table 9: Effects on niraparib and olaparib on normal haematopoietic cells 
Normal, human megakaryocytes were, however, more sensitive relative to mouse (IC50s of 0.46 
and 1 µM, respectively).These data indicate a ≥13-fold selectivity margin when comparing the 
average BRCAmut tumour cell. 
In vivo 
Efficacy of niraparib in BRCA-1/-2 mutant human cell-line xenograft models (studies PD005, 
PD007) 
Tumour regression was observed in a cell line derived human xenograft model of breast cancer 
with a functional BRCA-1 mutation with one month oral niraparib administration (100 mg/kg/day, 
either as QD or BID). When niraparib was dosed at 80 mg/kg QD for one, two, three, or four 
weeks, significant inhibition of tumour growth was observed in all groups, while continuous

treatment for 3 and 4 weeks resulted in an increase in regressions and remissions. This indicates 
that sustained inhibition of PARP is required for maximum anti-tumour efficacy in this model. 
Cells can develop HR deficiency by a variety of mechanisms including the loss of function or 
inactivation of tumour suppressor genes BRCA-1 or BRCA-2. Similarly, the loss of function or 
inactivation of other genes involved in the HR pathway can lead to an HR deficient (HRD) 
phenotype within a tumour. The Applicant has applied a sequencing test, the myChoice HRD test, 
to identify HRD-status in breast and ovarian cancers by detecting variants in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 
genes and quantitating genomic scarring of the tumour that can occur as a consequence of the 
error-prone non-homologous end joining repair pathway. An experimentally determined threshold 
(HRD Score cutoff) derived from molecular data and comparison with HRD scores from tumours 
with BRCA mutations was used to determine the HRD state and define a binary test output (HRD-
positive or HRD-negative). This threshold value was selected to have a high sensitivity for 
detecting HRD in treatment-naïve breast and ovarian tumours as defined by BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 
deficiency. 
Activity of niraparib in orthotopic high-grade serous ovarian cancer patient-derived xenograft (PDX) 
models (study 3000-09-002) 
To evaluate the potential therapeutic effect of single-agent niraparib in HRD-positive high-grade 
serous ovarian cancers, mice bearing treatment-naïve patient-derived orthotopic xenografts (PDX) 
were administered oral niraparib at 60 mg/kg/day for up to 28 days. Each tumour was tested for 
HRD status using the Myriad myChoice HRD test, to evaluate the potential utility of using this 
tumour classifier to identify patients that may benefit from niraparib therapy. Niraparib caused 
tumour regression in 7 out of 27 models overall (26%) and 7 out of 16 HRD positive models 
(44%). None of the HRD negative tumours responded to niraparib treatment.

When using a threshold of 50% tumour growth inhibition (TGI) relative to vehicle treatment as a 
marker for anti-tumour effect, 4 out of 11 HRD negative tumour models (36%) were found 
niraparib responsive. The rate was 46%, and the response rate in HRD positive models was 52%.

Efficacy of niraparib maintenance therapy in a BRCA-2mut high grade serous ovarian cancer 
patient derived xenograft (PDX) model (study 3000-09-003). 
To assess the potential for niraparib as combination therapy with platinum-treatment, or as a 
maintenance therapy following platinum-based treatment, one BRCA-2mut high grade serous 
ovarian cancer PDX model and one HRD-positive, BRCA-wt PDX model were selected. The tumour

models were sensitive to niraparib single therapy, with tumour shrinkage to 36% and 8% of 
baseline, respectively. Tumour regression was also observed after four weeks of treatment with 
carboplatin/paclitaxel alone, and in combination with niraparib. The growth trajectories were not 
significantly different between carboplatin/paclitaxel and niraparib/carboplatin/paclitaxel. Tumours 
without maintenance treatment exhibited rapid regrowth 11 weeks after end of the 4-week 
platinum-treatment. In contrast, in mice randomized to niraparib maintenance treatment, tumours 
(n=4) became undetectable. An additional study was conducted to assess niraparib activity in three 
tumour models derived from patients who had experienced recurrence following platinum based 
treatment, but whose tumours were still responsive at some level to platinum.  Following a single 
dose of carboplatin or carboplatin plus paclitaxel on day 1, daily niraparib monotherapy from day 8 
was considered effective in maintaining tumour suppression in ovarian cancer after platinum 
treatment. These observations suggest that niraparib may have a role in the maintenance setting 
after primary treatment of high grade serous ovarian cancers, while its role in combination with 
primary platinum-based therapy is less clear. 
Inhibition of PARP activity in tumour xenografts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (studies 
PD009, PD010) 
In vivo effect on tumour growth was seen in BRCA-mut and BRCAwt HRD ovarian tumour models 
with once daily oral administration of niraparib at a dose level sufficient to suppress 90% of PARP-1 
enzymatic activity in the tumour at 8 hours post dose, and to >50% inhibition of PARP activity in 
PBMCs at 8 hours post dose. Consequently, PARP inhibition levels in PBMCs may potentially be 
considered as a surrogate marker for tumour response.    
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In vitro secondary pharmacodynamics (studies PD011, PD012) 
Niraparib was assessed for binding to ion channels, transporters and other G-protein coupled 
receptors to evaluate the potential for off-target activity. Six endpoints exhibited IC50 values below 
5 μM. Niraparib was further assessed for functional activity against the two most potent targets 
identified in the primary assay, the dopamine transporter (DAT) and the norepinephrine 
transporter (NET) Niraparib was shown to inhibit the uptake of dopamine and norepinephrine with 
IC50 values of 24 and 130 nM, respectively. As a follow-up, three rodent studies were conducted to 
evaluate the effects of niraparib administration on brain monoamines. 
Pharmacological effects of niraparib on monoamines in the mouse brain (study PD014) 
Niraparib did not significantly change levels of dopamine, monoamines/metabolite levels or 
dopamine turnover in the striatum or hippocampus relative to the positive control amphetamine in 
mice following a single ip administration. Niraparib did not impact dopamine release, but increased 
intracellular dopamine and metabolite (DOPAC and HVA) levels in the cortex by 330%, 295% and 
236%, respectively. These results suggest that niraparib can cause a build-up of intracellular 
dopamine in the cortex without increasing dopamine availability at its site of action in the CNS.  
In vivo measurement of niraparib binding to the central dopamine transporter (DAT) in mice (study 
PD015) 
Niraparib occupancy of DAT in vivo was measured by PET in the mouse brain using the DAT specific 
tracer [11C]-CFT (PD015). Niraparib did not occupy DAT in the striatum at anti-tumour exposure 
levels, measured by PET on the mouse brain.

A comparison of niraparib and d-amphetamine induced locomotor behaviour (study PD013) 
Niraparib was examined for its ability to influence motor activity compared to amphetamine as a 
positive control in mice (PD013). While amphetamine significantly increased the total distance 
travelled by the mice in a dose-dependent manner, niraparib significantly decreased distance 
travelled. Further, no niraparib-related behavioural or neurological findings were observed following 
3 months repeated dosing in rats and dogs. Therefore, niraparib did not have behavioural or 
neurochemical effects consistent with enhanced DA availability in the CNS.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
Three safety pharmacology studies was performed to examine for potential effects of niraparib on 
the central nervous (CNS) and cardiovascular (CV) systems.  
Effects of niraparib on hERG (potassium channel) expressing CHO cells (study ID TT #07-4734, 
non GLP) 
In this study it was demonstrated that niraparib inhibited hERG current with an IC50 value of 10 µM 
(3200ng/mL).The positive control (cisapride 30 nM) inhibited 54 % of the hERG tail current, and 
confirmed the validity of the experiment. 
Cardiovascular effects in dogs (study ID TT #07-5300, non-GLP) 
Niraparib was evaluated in a cardiovascular study in anesthetized dogs for potential 
pharmacological activity after intravenous (IV) administration. Niraparib did not induce any 
significant changes in ECG parameters in conscious dogs at doses up to 10 mg/kg. 
Effect of niraparib on neurological function in mice (study ID TT #07-5362) 
Niraparib was evaluated in a neurological function study using a functional battery of tests. 
Niraparib had no effect on neurological function in conscious female mice at a single oral dose of 
100 mg/kg. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No non-clinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were conducted with niraparib. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Single dose pharmacokinetic (PK) studies were conducted in male rats, dogs and monkeys in vivo, 
and in experimental species and human in vitro. Repeat-dose PK studies have not been conducted, 
but toxicokinetic (TK) analysis of niraparib and the main metabolite M1 were conducted as part of 
the pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies.  
Absorption 
Niraparib was rapidly absorbed following oral administration in rats and dogs (T max ~ 2 and 0.5 
hrs, respectively). In rats, iv niraparib demonstrates a moderate plasma clearance (28 
mL/min/kg), a high volume of distribution (6.9 L/kg), and a moderate half-life (3.4 hours). In 
dogs, iv niraparib exhibited a high clearance (31 mL/min/kg), a high volume of distribution (12.3 
L/kg), and a moderate half-life (5.7 hours). The oral bioavailability of niraparib was low in rats 
(27%) and moderate in dogs (57%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/648982/2017 
Page 25/122 
  
  
Distribution 
Conventional tissue distribution studies have not been conducted. Niraparib was moderately bound 
to plasma proteins (~71.6 - 84.0%), and red blood cells (blood-to-plasma concentration ratios of 
1.1-1.7) across species. Niraparib is highly cell membrane-permeable, with the counter efflux from 
P-glycoprotein (P-gp) being evidently limited. 
Niraparib is readily distributed to the brain of rats and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of monkeys. 
Brain-to-plasma Cmax ratios in rats were 0.77 and 0.64 following PO doses of 10 and 30 mg/kg, 
respectively. In monkeys, CSF-to-plasma Cmax and AUC0-inf ratios were approximately 0.31 and 
0.19, respectively, after a PO dose of 10 mg/kg. 
Metabolism 
All metabolites formed by human hepatocytes have been detected in the species used in the 
toxicity studies, with M1, a carboxylic acid metabolite formed by the carboxylesterases (CEs), being 
the major primary metabolite in circulation. 
Diverse metabolic pathways, mediated by enzymes in several classes with non-CYP enzymes being 
principal, were detected. The minor oxidative pathways were primarily mediated by CYP1A2 and 
CYP3A4/5 with a possibly minor contribution from CYP2D6. This warrants a minimal risk for the 
drug-drug interaction for niraparib when being concurrent with CYP inhibitory and/or inductive 
agents. 
Excretion 
Niraparib was primarily eliminated unchanged via faecal (biliary) and renal routes in rats, while 
being mainly eliminated as M1 via renal excretion in dogs. In addition, findings in faeces in bile-
cannulated rats and dogs indicate intestinal excretion, likely via the action of the efflux transporter, 
P-gp. The overall recoveries in rats and dogs were high and virtually identical (~ 80% for 5-day 
collections for both species), suggestive of minimal long term body retention. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
The potential interaction of niraparib with major drug-metabolizing enzymes and the interaction 
with drug transporters were evaluated in vitro. Data are discussed under the clinical section. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicology dossier provided for niraparib, comprises repeat dose toxicity studies in rats and 
dogs up to 3 months, genotoxicity studies in vitro and in vivo and phototoxicity studies. All the 
pivotal studies were performed according to GLP.  
Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity study has been submitted. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies with daily oral (gavage) administration of niraparib for up to three 
months were conducted in rats and dogs.

The results indicate that bone marrow is the main target organ for toxicity, with subsequent 
reduction in RBC and WBC parameters and lymphoid depletion in the bone marrow, spleen, thymus 
and lymph nodes. Infections and septicaemia observed in the one-month rat study are considered 
secondary to the lymphoid depletion, leading to mortality in male rats.  
The testes were also identified as a target organ for toxicity in both species, with effects seen as 
reduced spermatogenesis and a decreased amount of spermatogenic epithelium in rats and dogs. 
This is in agreement with the proposed role of PARP in chromatin modifications during 
spermatogenesis (Dantzer 2006, Celik-Ozenki 2013). 
Interspecies comparison showed that both rats and dogs were exposed to niraparib as well as to 
main human metabolites M1 and M10 at exposure levels below human levels at intended 
therapeutic dose. In rats, the AUC of M1 was approximately 15- to 50-fold less than the AUC of 
niraparib, while in dogs the AUC of M1 reached approximately 15-fold the AUC of niraparib. The 
similarity of safety profiles and nature of the adverse findings in both species, despite a difference 
in parent/M1 exposure ratio, suggest low contribution of M1 to the adverse findings of niraparib.

Genotoxicity 
Niraparib in hydrochloride salt form was clearly positive in two non-GLP Ames tests, indicating a 
mutagenic potential. Niraparib in tosylate salt form, however, was negative in three GLP-compliant 
Ames tests.   
Niraparib (independent of salt form) is considered clastogenic in mammalian test systems in vitro 
and in a micronucleus test in vivo, as expected for a PARP-1/PARP-2 inhibitor, at plasma exposure 
levels below therapeutic exposure levels. 
Carcinogenicity 
No Carcinogenicity study has been submitted. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No reproductive and developmental toxicity study has been performed. In a paper, referred to by 
the applicant, it was shown that PARP-1 and PARP-2 double knockout mutant embryos die around 
the onset of gastrulation and that PARP-1 and PARP-2 is essential during early embryogenesis 
(Menissier de Murcia et al, 2003). The PARP-1/PARP-2/PARP-3 inhibitor olaparib was shown to be 
teratogenic at low doses and to produce total embryo lethality at levels below human exposure 
(Lynparza EPAR, 2014). Niraparib is clastogenic and bone marrow is the main target organ for 
toxicity. An overall evaluation of the data is that, in compliance with ICH S9, it is not necessary to 
perform reproductive and developmental toxicity studies with niraparib. 
Local Tolerance  
No local tolerance study has been performed 
Other toxicity studies 
Phototoxicity studies 
Results from the 3T3 NRU in vitro assay indicate that niraparib has a phototoxic potential but the 
results from an in vivo study with Long Evans pigmented rats showed no evidence of cutaneous or 
ocular phototoxicity. 
Immunotoxicity 
Immunotoxicity was observed as effects on the bone marrow in the preclinical studies. Separate 
immunogenicity studies have not been conducted. This is acceptable, and in accordance with ICH 
S8. 
Impurities  
No specific impurity studies were conducted. Two impurities are above the qualification threshold; 
impurity A and a niraparib tosylate monohydrate enantiomer. Because impurity A is identical to the 
main metabolite M1 in humans and animals, the proposed specification limits in drug substance 
and drug product are considered adequately qualified.   
The enantiomer was present at 0.10% in the batch used for the 3-month rat and dog studies. 
Based on the highest dose levels of niraparib administered in these studies (30 mg/kg/day and 12 
mg/kg/day in rats and dogs, respectively), and the intended clinical dosing of niraparib at 300 
mg/day, the proposed specification of NMT 0.20% are acceptable from a non-clinical point of view.

In vitro data indicate that BRCA-deficient tumour cells are more sensitive to niraparib than BRCA 
wild-type tumour cells, and normal epithelial and haematopoietic cells. Human megacaryocytes, 
however, appear more sensitive to niraparib than other human and murine haematopoietic cells 
and murine megacaryocytes, with IC50 at 460 nM and IC90 at 1000 nM. Although this is 13-fold 
higher than for the BRCA-deficient cells, expected human plasma levels of niraparib at intended 
therapeutic dosing is about 2-fold higher than IC90 for human megacaryocytes, indicating a 
potential for thrombocytopenia. Similarly, reversible findings compatible with bone marrow 
suppression have been observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies without margins of safety.  
Thrombocytopenia is an adverse event often seen in clinical studies with niraparib, and has been 
adequately reflected in the proposed SmPC for Zejula.  
Thrombocytopenia is also listed as an adverse event in the SmPC for Lynparza (olaparib), but 
appears to be a more frequent event for niraparib than olaparib. Based on in vitro data with human 
megacaryocytes, there are no apparent difference in IC50 values, or in selectivity margins (ratio 
between IC50 values for megacaryocytes and tumour cell growth) for olaparib and niraparib, 
respectively.  However, IC 90 values could suggest that the human megacaryocytes are more 
sensitive to niraparib than olaparib. 
Homologous recombination (HR) is a type of genetic recombination most widely used by cells to 
accurately repair harmful breaks that occur on both strands of DNA, known as double-strand 
breaks. In cells with a deficiency in homologous recombination repair (HRD), such as those with 
BRCA-1 and BRCA-2 mutations, PARP inhibition leads to irreparable DSBs, use of the error prone 
NHEJ pathway, resultant genomic instability, and ultimately cell death. The Applicant has applied a 
test to score the HR deficiency in tumour cells.  No validation data has been provided for the 
Myriad myChoice HRD test. According to the Applicant, however, the test provides a HRD score 
which is an unweighted sum of three independent DNA-based measures of genomic instability 
based on loss of heterozygosity (LOH), telemetric allelic imbalance (TAI) and large-scale state 
transitions (LST). A HRD score of ≥42 (the 5th percentile of the HRD scores in a combined ovarian 
and breast training set of tumours with known BRCA1/2 deficiencies and/or BRCA1 or BRCA2 
mutation) is by the Applicant defined as an indication for homologous repair deficiency (Telli et al., 
2016).   
The indication sought for niraparib is broader than the approved indication for olaparib, not limited 
to the treatment of BRCA-1/-2 deficient (due to mutation, low expression or deletion) tumour type. 
Based on clinical (and non-clinical) data it is agreed that niraparib responsiveness goes beyond the 
BRCA mutation status (as measured with the myChoice test). The Applicant is recommended to 
further explore validated biomarkers of HR deficiency that could be incorporated in clinical practice 
in order to identify those patients that would benefit from niraparib therapy.  
The Applicant has provided results of a study assessing niraparib activity in tumours derived from 
patients who had experienced recurrence following platinum based treatment, but whose tumours 
were still responsive at some level to platinum.  From data presented in study E0322-U1509 is it 
not possible to evaluate the tumour response to carboplatinum single administration and thus it is 
not possible to draw any conclusion on the non-clinical correlation between niraparib response vs 
platinum response (in other terms whether platinum sensitivity could be a predictive factor of 
niraparib response besides being a prognostic disease factor). Clinically, however, platinum 
sensitivity is considered a sufficient marker for niraparib responsiveness.  
 In study 3000-09-003, PH077 responded to niraparib maintenance therapy (following primary 4-
week treatment with platinum+paclitaxel+niraparib): data for PH039 are not available. Although 
both HRD+ PDXs resulted sensitive to niraparib monotherapy (study 3000-09-002), tumour growth 
inhibition was more marked for PH077 that is also BCRA 2mut respect to PH039 that is BCRA wt. 
The BCRA mutation status may play a relevant role also for the positive response to niraparib as

maintenance treatment after a previous niraparib treatment, rather than tumour aggressivity as 
suggested by the Applicant. 
None of the HRD-negative tumour models in study 3000-09-002 were found niraparib sensitive, 
defined as tumour regression. However, when using a threshold of 50% tumour growth inhibition 
(TGI) relative to vehicle treatment as a marker for anti-tumour effect, 4 out of 11 HRD negative 
tumour models (36%)  were found niraparib responsive. However, such an exercise is questioned 
for study 3000-09-002, considering the highly variable number of animals (2-16) between 
treatment groups and tumour models, and extensive variability in duration of treatment (7-28 
days).    
The Applicant has discussed a number of plausible reasons for the apparent niraparib responsivity 
in HRD-negative tumours, including false negatives, altered genetic properties after HRD-testing, 
and high PARP-1 expression. Taken together, the true HRD status of the tumour models classified 
as HRD negative by the MyChoice test is unknown. Consequently, due to the uncertainties related 
to the MyChoice test, the deficiencies in the Applicant’s response regarding potential niraparib 
responsivity in tumour models classified as HRD negative will not be further pursued. 
In vivo effects on tumour growth were seen in BRCA-mut and BRCAwt HRD ovarian tumour models 
with once daily oral administration of niraparib at a dose level sufficient to suppress 90% of PARP-1 
enzymatic activity in the tumour at 8 hours post dose, and to >50% inhibition of PARP activity in 
PBMCs at 8 hours post dose. Consequently, PARP inhibition levels in PBMCs may potentially be 
considered as a surrogate marker for tumour response.  The reason for the enhanced level of PARP 
suppression in tumours relative to PBMC is not known, but a potential explanation proposed by the 
Applicant is a preferential distribution of niraparib to tissues relative to plasma. Distribution studies 
have, however, not been conducted. 
M1 is a major human metabolite, with clinical M1 to niraparib exposure ratios of 1.3-2.2 fold in 
plasma, and with a mean T1/2 of 88h. In vitro studies indicate that M1 has no inhibitory effect on 
PARP1 or PARP2 (IC50 <10 µM). Potential secondary effects have not been evaluated. This is 
considered acceptable, in view of the intended indication. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics 
Niraparib readily crosses the BBB in rodents, and inhibits the DAT transporter in vitro with an IC50 
level (24 nM) below human Cmax levels (free fraction) at intended therapeutic dose. Niraparib did 
not occupy DAT in striatum in mice following single doses, and did not change levels of dopamine, 
monoamines/metabolite levels or dopamine turnover in the striatum or hippocampus in mice 
(study PD014). However, increased intracellular levels of DA and metabolites have been observed 
in cortex (study PD014), indicating a potential build-up of intracellular dopamine in this region. The 
long-term consequence of such a build-up is not known. It has, however, been suggested that 
accumulation of intracellular DA may trigger oxidative stress and neurotoxicity (Lohr et al, 2017).  
In mice, single ip doses of niraparib increased intracellular levels of DA and metabolites in cortex. 
No effect on neurological function, including general behaviour, neural reflexes, spontaneous 
activity and thermoregulation were observed in mice in a 24-hour period following a single oral 
dose of 100 mg/kg. However, reduced locomotor activity was seen in mice following single ip 
doses. No effect on behavioural and/or neurological parameters were observed in repeat-dose 
toxicity studies in rats and dogs at estimated CNS exposure levels similar to or below expected 
therapeutic exposure level (see section 5.3 of the SmPC), and margins of safety cannot be 
established.  
Safety pharmacology 
Niraparib tosylate salt inhibited hERG current in a GLP assay, with an IC50 value of 15 µM. 
Considering observed Cmax levels at intended therapeutic dose in patients of 4.37 µM (clinical study 
Assessment report  
EMA/648982/2017 
Page 32/122 
  
  
PN001), and plasma protein binding fraction of 83%, the IC50 value is only 13.5-fold free fraction 
in humans (3200ng/mL).  
Niraparib did not induce any significant changes in ECG parameters in conscious dogs at doses up 
to 10 mg/kg. Peak average plasma concentrations measured in dogs during infusion at 10 mg/kg 
(15.3 µM) was only 3.5-fold higher than observed Cmax levels at intended therapeutic dose in 
patients, leading to low margins of safety. Taken together, niraparib inhibits the hERG current with 
low margins of safety. A potential clinical relevance of this finding cannot be excluded due to low 
margins of safety to exposure levels at the highest dose administered in the negative ECG study in 
dogs. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
Single-dose PK data from rats and dogs indicate substantial distribution (Vd,ss of 6.9 and 12.3 L/kg, 
respectively). Further, brain distribution studies in rats and Rhesus monkeys indicate that niraparib 
is readily distributed across the BBB. Although in vitro data indicate that niraparib is a P-gp 
substrate, the brain:plasma ratio in rats increases over time, suggesting a sustained brain 
distribution.  
Metabolism 
The data provided by the Applicant regrading in vivo metabolism is rather limited. Study PK003 is a 
study on metabolism and excretion of niraparib in male rats and dogs following IV administration, 
and is mostly addressing excretion. While the levels of niraparib and metabolites were quantified in 
urine, bile and faeces, the plasma levels were not quantified. Further, the route of administration in 
PK003 is IV, and not the intended clinical route of administration. Consequently, metabolism of 
niraparib following oral administration has not been addressed by the Applicant. However, data 
from study PK003 do indicate that the major circulating metabolite in rats and dogs following po 
administration of niraparib is M1, and its glucuronide metabolite M10.  
Based on TK data from the 3-month repeat-dose toxicity studies, niraparib was the major 
circulating compound in rats. Although the plasma levels of M1 generally were slightly higher in 
males than in females and appeared to be greater after repeated administration of niraparib, M1 
comprised less than 10% of the parent compound in rats.  In dogs, however, the plasma levels of 
M1 generally appeared to be independent of dose and sex, and were similar after single and 
repeated oral (gavage) administration. M1 comprises the major plasma component, with a 
systemic exposure level approximately 15-fold higher than to the parent substance.    
Toxicology 
Repeat-dose toxicity 
The choice of rat and dog as species for non-clinical testing of niraparib is considered acceptable 
according to ICH S9. 
In repeat -dose oral toxicity studies, niraparib was administered daily for up to 3  months’ duration 
in rats and dogs. The major primary target organ for toxicity in both species was the bone marrow, 
with associated changes in peripheral haematology parameteres.  
The adverse findings on bone marrow are expected effects as a result of PARP inhibition and is 
considered to reflect the pharmacology of niraparib. The testes were also identified as a target 
organ for toxicity in both species (reversible decreased spermatogenesis), the relevance is however 
limited as the target clinical population consists of female patients. 
These findings were dose related, occurred at exposure levels below those seen clinically, and were 
largely reversible within 4 weeks of cessation of dosing (see section 5.3 of the SmPC). They are 
Assessment report  
EMA/648982/2017 
Page 33/122 
  
  
also in line with observations from animal studies with the PARP inhibitor olaparib (marketed as 
Lynparza). 
At NOAEL, exposure levels to bound + unbound niraparib free base were below human levels at 
intended therapeutic dose (i.e., Cmax 1144 ng/ml; AUC 21255 ng·h/ml from clinical study PN001). 
Clinical exposure level to M1 following repeated dosing has not been presented by the Applicant. 
However, plasma exposure ratio of M1 to niraparib following a single dose of niraparib was 
approximately 1.3-2.2 in clinical study PR-30-5015-C. Taken together, there are no margins of 
safety for the observed findings in rats and dogs. 
Genotoxicity/carcinogenicity 
Niraparib was not mutagenic in a bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames) test but was clastogenic 
in an in vitro mammalian chromosomal aberration assay and in an in vivo rat bone marrow 
micronucleus assay. This clastogenicity is consistent with genomic instability resulting from the 
primary pharmacology of niraparib and indicates potential for genotoxicity in humans (see section 
5.3 of the SmPC).  
No genotoxicity studies were performed with the M1 metabolite. This is acceptable, considering 
that niraparib is genotoxic, and in view of the intended patient population. 
Carcinogenicity studies are not required to support a marketing application for the proposed patient 
population (in line with ICH S9 guideline). In addition, the patients with ovarian cancer receiving 
niraparib have received prior therapy with multiple cycles of platinum-containing chemotherapy 
that is known to be genotoxic. The omission of such studies is therefore considered acceptable.  
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Studies on reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted. PARP-1 and 
PARP-2 is considered essential during embryogenesis, and animal studies with the PARP-1/PARP-
2/PARP-3 inhibitor olaparib have demonstrated embryolethal and teratogenic effects. 
Consequently, embryotoxic and teratogenic effects of niraparib is expected and niraparib should 
not be used during pregnancy (see section 4.6 of the SmPC). The lack of reproductive and 
developmental toxicity studies is therefore considered acceptable.  
The environmental risk assessment for Zejula requires further investigations as a phase II Tier A 
has not been submitted. The applicant is recommended to submit an updated ERA by the end of 
Q2 2018. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data provided during the procedure support marketing authorisation.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the non-clinical issues: 
- The Applicant is recommended to further explore validated biomarkers of HR deficiency that could 
be incorporated in clinical practice in order to identify those patients that would benefit from 
niraparib therapy. 
- The Applicant is recommended to submit an updated ERA including the Phase II Tier A.

aBRAVO study is still open to enrolment and has not yet completed its primary efficacy analysis (final progression-free survival

Group and EORTC), the Sponsor is blinded to aggregate data by study arm to avoid perception of impact to the conduct of the 
study. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
A total of five clinical studies with pharmacokinetic data are submitted, with a total of 524 subjects 
(94% women) receiving niraparib. However, thorough PK data has only been presented in the 
dossier for three studies (133 subjects). 
One population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modelling report (Niraparib PPK) was 
submitted, using data from studies PN001, PR-30-5011-C, PR-30-5011-C1 and PR-30-5011-C2. 
Absorption  
Niraparib was rapidly absorbed with median Tmax occurring at 2.5-4 hours postdose. The absolute 
bioavailability of niraparib was determined to be 71.7%. Following a single-dose administration of 
300 mg niraparib under fasting conditions, niraparib was measurable in plasma within 30 minutes 
and the mean peak plasma concentration (Cmax) for niraparib was reached in about 3 hours 
[804 ng/mL (% CV:50.2 %)]. Following multiple oral doses of niraparib from 30 mg to 400 mg 
once daily, accumulation of niraparib was approximately 2 to 3 folds. 
The systemic exposures (C max and AUC) to niraparib increased in a dose-proportional manner when 
the dose of niraparib increased from 30 mg to 400 mg. The absolute bioavailability of niraparib is 
approximately 73 %, indicating minimal first pass effect. 
Influence of food: 
A concomitant high-fat meal did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetics of niraparib after 
administration of 300 mg of niraparib. 
Distribution 
Niraparib was moderately protein bound in human plasma (83.0 %). In a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis of niraparib, the Vd/F was 1,074 L in cancer patients, indicating extensive 
tissue distribution of niraparib. The blood-to-plasma concentration ratio was 1.6. Overall, niraparib

exhibited higher human serum albumin (HSA) binding than alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) binding 
in human plasma. 
Elimination 
The carboxylesterases-catalysed amide hydrolysis is the major primary metabolic pathway, 
followed by the UDP-glucuronosyltransferases-mediated glucuronidation and other minor secondary 
pathways. Niraparib is metabolised primarily by carboxylesterases (CEs) to form a major inactive 
metabolite, M1.  
The minor pathway of oxidative metabolism of niraparib was primarily mediated by CYP1A1/2 and 
CYP3A4/5 with minor contribution from CYP2D6. 
In a mass balance study, M1 and M10 (the subsequently formed M1 glucuronides) were the major 
circulating metabolites. Niraparib is eliminated with t 1/2 varying between 36 and 96 hours in 
different studies. Apparent total body clearance (CL/F) is 8-17 L. 
Following a single oral 300-mg dose of niraparib, the mean terminal half-life (t ½) of niraparib 
ranged from 48 to 51 hours (approximately 2 days) (food effect study PR30-5011-C2-FE). In a 
population pharmacokinetic analysis, the apparent total clearance (CL/F) of niraparib was 16.2 L/h 
in cancer patients. 
Niraparib is eliminated primarily through the hepatobiliary and renal routes. Following an oral 
administration of a single 300-mg dose of [14C]-niraparib, on average 86.2 % (range 71 % to 
91 %) of the dose was recovered in urine and feces over 21 days. Radioactive recovery in the urine 
accounted for 47.5 % (range 33.4 % to 60.2 %) and in the feces for 38.8 % (range 28.3 % to 
47.0 %) of the dose. In pooled samples collected over 6 days, 40.0 % of the dose was recovered in 
the urine primarily as metabolites and 31.6 % of the dose was recovered in the feces primarily as 
unchanged niraparib. 
The major primary metabolite M1 exhibited a comparable to (AUC and Cmax) or possibly slightly 
higher exposure (AUC) than niraparib, and t 1/2 of M1 to be analogous to the parent.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
• 
Dose proportionality 
Study P001 was designed to establish the safety, tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamics (PD), and 
recommended Phase 2 dose of niraparib in patients with advanced solid tumours. The first part of 
the study (Part A) was a dose escalation and confirmation scheme to determine the MTD and 
recommended Phase 2 dose of niraparib in patients with advanced solid tumors. A total of 60 
patients were treated in Part A QD at 10 dose levels ranging from 30 mg to 400 mg. The MTD 
determined in Part A was 300 mg QD. A total of 40 patients were treated in Part B at the MTD of 
300 mg QD as determined in Part A. The recommended Phase 2 dose determined on the basis of 
cumulative data from Part A and Part B was 300 mg QD. Due to a decision to suspend enrolment 
(unrelated to any safety reasons), Part C did not enrol any patients. A total of 4 patients were 
enrolled and treated in Part D, with 300 mg QD.

Table 15: Summary statistics for pharmacokinetic parameters of niraparib following multiple QD 
oral doses of niraparib to cancer patients (study P001, parts A and B) 
Following multiple oral doses of 30-400 mg doses of niraparib for 21 days (parts A and B), 
niraparib was rapidly absorbed with a median Tmax ranging from 3.0-3.6 hours on Day 1 and 1.5-
4.0 hours on Day last. Mean t1/2 ranged from 32.8-46.0 hours, based on the plasma samples 
collected for 96 hours starting on day 21 over the 60-400 mg dose range.  
An exploratory analysis of dose proportionality indicated no dose dependent trends in dose-
normalized area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24) and the 
maximum concentration (Cmax), suggesting approximate dose-proportional increases in exposure 
across the range of doses studied.

Time dependency 
In study PN001, the average plasma concentration profiles following multiple doses decreased in 
an approximately biphasic manner and trough concentrations (Ctrough) generally approach steady 
state by day 12 of intensive sampling across all dose levels. Consistent with its t1/2, niraparib 
displayed moderate accumulation over 21 days of daily doses. Over the entire dose range studied 
(30-400 mg), the AUC0-24 and Cmax geometric mean accumulation ratios (Day 21/Day 1) after 21 
days of dosing ranged from 1.99 to 4.22 and 1.55 to 3.62 for AUC0-24 and Cmax, respectively. For 
the 30-400 mg dose range studied, AUC0-24 and Cmax geometric mean accumulation ratios (day 
last/day 1) after 21 days of dosing ranged from 1.99–4.22 and 1.55–3.62 for AUC0-24 and Cmax, 
respectively.

Special populations 
No specific studies have been undertaken or planned to investigate the influence of age, weight or 
race on niraparib.

Impaired renal function 
There is no formal study of niraparib in patients with renal impairment. However, in the population 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modeling report, creatinine clearance  was evaluated as a 
parameter of renal function. Creatinine clearance in the range of 33 to 236 mL/min had no 
significant impact on the pharmacokinetics of niraparib. The pharmacokinetics of niraparib have not 
been assessed in patients with severe renal impairment end-stage renal disease undergoing 
haemodialysis.

Impaired hepatic function 
There is no formal study of niraparib in patients with hepatic impairment. However based on 
population PK analysis from pooled Phase1 and 3 studies (PN001 and PR-30-5011-C), baseline 
serum albumin, AST, total bilirubin, and ALT levels did not have a clinically important effect on 
niraparib pharmacokinetics in patients with various degrees of hepatic impairment. The 
pharmacokinetics of niraparib have not been assessed in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
• 
Gender 
Based on the population PK analysis using the data combined from Phase 1 and Phase 3 studies 
(PN001 and PR-30-5011-C), gender had no significant impact on the PK of niraparib.  
• 
Race 
Based on the population PK analysis using the data combined from Phase 1 and Phase 3 studies 
(PN001 and PR-30-5011-C), race had no significant impact on the PK of niraparib.  
• 
Weight 
Based on the population PK analysis using the data combined from Phase 1 and Phase 3 studies 
(PN001 and PR-30-5011-C), weight had no significant impact on the PK of niraparib.  
• 
Elderly 
Based on the population PK analysis using the data combined from Phase 1 and Phase 3 studies 
(PN001 and PR-30-5011-C), age had no significant impact on the PK of niraparib. There are limited 
clinical data in patients aged 75 or over.

Children 
No study has been conducted to investigate the pharmacokinetics of niraparib in paediatric 
patients. 
Inter and intraindividual variability 
Interindividual variability was moderate to high for the pharmacokinetic parameters. The cause of 
the variability is not explained.  
Intraindividual variability was determined to be 36.9% in the popPK model. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No specific in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were performed. 
To evaluate the substrate and/or inhibitor potential of niraparib and M1 for the transporters P-
glycoprotein (P-gp), breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), organic anion transporting 
polypeptides 1B1 and 1B3 (OATP1B1 and OATP1B3), organic anion transporters 1 and 3 (OAT1 and 
OAT3), organic cation transporters 1 and 2 (OCT1 and OCT2), and bile salt export pump (BSEP), 
HEK (human embryonic kidney 293) cell lines were transfected with each of the uptake 
transporters of interest (OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OAT1, OAT3, OCT2) (15TESAP1R2). The 
uptake of a transporter-specific probe substrate was studied with and without niraparib or M1 in 
transporter- and vector-transfected control cells.  
Cytochrome p450 enzymes 
Niraparib as a substrate of CYPs (CYP1A2 and CYP3A4) 
Niraparib  is  a  substrate  of  carboxylesterases  (CEs)  and  UDP-glucuronosyltransferases  (UGTs) 
in vivo. Oxidative metabolism of niraparib is minimal in vivo. Oxidative metabolism of niraparib is 
minimal in vivo. 
Inhibition of CYPs (CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4) 
Neither  niraparib  nor  M1  is  an  inhibitor  of  any  active  substance-metabolising  CYP  enzymes, 
namely CYP1A1/2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4/5. 
Even  though  any  inhibition  of  CYP3A4  in  the  liver  is  not  expected,  in  the  intestine  where 
niraparib concentrations could be higher, this effect is not established.  
Induction of CYPs (CYP1A2 and CYP3A4) 
Neither niraparib nor M1 is a CYP3A4 inducer in vitro. In vitro, niraparib weakly induces CYP1A2 at 
high concentrations and the clinical relevance of this effect would not be completely ruled out. M1 
is not a CYP1A2 inducer.  
Transporters 
Niraparib as a substrate or inhibitor of efflux transporters (P-gp, BCRP, BSEP and MATE1/2) 
Evaluation of niraparib and M1 as a substrate of P-gp and BCRP was carried out in MDR1-MDCK, 
BCRP-MDCK and MDCK cells (study 15TESAP1R2). Permeability was evaluated in both the apical-
to-basolateral and basolateral-to-apical directions.  
Niraparib  is  a  substrate  of  P  gp  and  BCRP.  However,  due  to  its  high  permeability  and 
bioavailability, the risk of clinically relevant interactions with medicinal products that inhibit these 
transporters is unlikely..  
Assessment report  
EMA/648982/2017 
Page 42/122 
  
  
 
 
Niraparib  and  its  major  primary  metabolite  are  not  substrates  of  BSEP.  The  major  primary 
metabolite M1 is not a substrate of P gp, BCRP, or BSEP. Niraparib is not a substrate of MATE 1 or 
2, while M1 is a substrate of both. 
Niraparib is not an inhibitor of BSEP. In vitro, niraparib inhibits P-gp very weakly and BCRP  with 
an IC50 = 161 µM and 5.8 µM, respectively.  
Niraparib  is  an  inhibitor  of  MATE1  and  -2  with  IC50  of  0.18  µM  and  ≤  0.14  µM,  respectively. 
Increased  plasma  concentrations  of  co-administered  medicinal  products  that  are  substrates  of 
these transporters (e.g. metformin) cannot be excluded. 
The  major  primary  metabolite  M1  does  not  appear  to  be  an  inhibitor  of  P-gp,  BCRP,  BSEP  or 
MATE1/2. 
Niraparib  as  a  substrate  or  inhibitor  of  hepatic  uptake  transporters  (OATP1B1,  OATP1B3,  and 
OCT1) 
Neither niraparib nor M1 are substrates of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or OCT1.  
Neither niraparib nor M1 are inhibitors of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. In vitro, niraparib weakly inhibits

Niraparib as a substrate or inhibitor of renal uptake transporters (OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2) 
Neither niraparib nor M1 is a substrate or inhibitor of OAT1, OAT3, and OCT2.  
The combination of niraparib with vaccines or immunosuppressant agents has not been studied. 
The data on niraparib in combination with cytotoxic medicinal products are limited. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The PD of niraparib is based on non-clinical in vitro and in vivo studies. Clinical PD investigations 
include an assessment of its inhibition of PARP in vivo in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) 
(PN001), QTc prolongation (PR-30-5011-C1-QTC) and exposure-response in terms of PFS and 
safety in patients with platinum ovarian cancer (PR-30-5011-C). Data from two studies (PN001, 
C-30-5011-C) were used to develop and evaluate a popPK model and to explore the PK/PD 
relationship. 
Mechanism of action 
Niraparib is an inhibitor of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 and -2. PARP inhibition is 
thought to induce cytotoxicity by blocking base excision DNA repair. In tumours deficient of a 
functional high fidelity homologous recombination (HR) DNA repair system e.g. due to a germline 
or somatic BRCA mutation, the repair is instead performed by more error prone mechanisms (e.g. 
NHEJ) resulting in genomic instability and subsequent cell death. The proposed mechanism of 
action is supported by in vitro and in vivo non-clinical data. PARP inhibition in PBMCs has also been 
shown in the in vivo clinical study PN001. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Primary pharmacology 
The results from study PN001 informed the RD2P and dose reduction recommendations. The 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of niraparib was 300 mg, and this dose was selected for further 
clinical studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/648982/2017 
Page 43/122 
  
  
 
Of the 104 patients, across all dose levels, who received at least one dose of study drug, 14 
patients achieved confirmed or unconfirmed PR by RECIST and/or by CA-125 criteria. An additional 
41 patients had stable disease by RECIST. Among the remaining 49 patients, 36 had progressive 
disease, and 13 had unknown response, due to discontinuation prior to post-baseline assessments. 
Among the 50 ovarian cancer patients in the study, 22 had BRCA mutations. Eight of these 22 
patients responded by RECIST (with 7 of the 8 having CA-125 response as well), for a response 
rate of 36.4% (95% CI: 17.2%, 59.3%). Among the 28 ovarian cancer patients who did not have 
BRCA mutations or whose BRCA mutation status was unknown, 2 patients achieved confirmed PR 
by RECIST and by CA-125, and another 2 patients achieved unconfirmed CA-125 PRs, for a 
response rate of 14.3% (95% CI: 4.0%, 32.7%).  
PARP inhibition in PBMCs were apparently documented at doses of ≥ 60 mg QD and ≥ 80 mg QD, 
respectively. No data regarding the validation or qualification of the analytical method used for 
measurement of PARP activity has been provided.  
Secondary pharmacology 
Due to the mutagenic potential of niraparib, its effect on cardiac repolarisation was investigated in 
ovarian cancer patients (pivotal study). Based on a pooled analysis of intensive ECG 
measurements, the administration of single dose niraparib at the therapeutic dose of 300 mg 
appears not to prolong the QT interval. The QTc data collected as part of the Phase 3 trial for 
niraparib was evaluated via a graphical and regression approach (data not shown). These data are 
derived from patients receiving single (Cycle 1 Day 1) and multiple doses (Cycle 2 Day 1) of 
niraparib. The regression plots show that there is no relationship between increasing niraparib 
concentrations and QTcF. The higher exposure (i.e. plasma centration), after single dose on Day 1 
and after multiple daily doses at steady state, did not lead to the elevated QTcF.  
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances 
No pharmacodynamic interactions studies have been conducted. 
PK/PD relationship 
The PKPD relationship between individual niraparib exposure parameters and the measures of 
efficacy and safety responses was explored using a popPK model. The 2-compartment model was 
based on data from studies PC-30-5011-C (365 patients), PC-30-5011-C1-QTc (26 patients), PC-
30-5011-C2-FE (17 patients) and PN001 (104 patients). The niraparib exposure parameters used 
in the PKPD analyses were Cmax on Day 1 (2hrs postdose) and at steady state, Ctrough and AUCtau 
over the dosing interval at steady state.  
Exposure-PFS 
Exploratory subgroup analyses were carried out for low and high niraparib exposure groups (from 
study PR-30-5011-C) based on median values for popPK model predicted Ct rough, Cmax, and AUCtau. 
KM estimates were used to examine PFS response in the two niraparib exposure-defined 
subgroups. The low and high niraparib exposure groups were further subdivided into gBRCAmut, 
non-gBRCAmut, and HRD-positive groups. 
The median PFS for the high vs. low niraparib exposure groups in the gBRCAmut cohort was: 
•  21.3 vs. 13.5 months with HR 0.81 (95% CI of 0.49-1.35) based on steady-state Ctrough, 
•  >15.7 vs. 13.8 months with HR 0.72 (95% CI of 0.43-1.22) based on steady-state Cmax,  
•  >15.7 vs. 15.9 months with HR 0.91 (95% CI of 0.54-1.52) based on steady-state AUCtau. 
The median PFS for the high vs. low niraparib exposure groups in the non-gBRCAmut cohort was: 
•  10.7 vs. 8.2 months with HR 0.94 (95% CI of 0.66-1.34) based on steady-state Ctrough 
Assessment report  
EMA/648982/2017 
Page 44/122 
  
  
•  11.3 vs. 7.5 months with HR 0.72 (95% CI of 0.51-1.03) based on steady-state Cmax 
•  11.5 vs. 7.5 months with a HR of 0.70 (95% CI of 0.49-0.99) based on steady-state AUCtau 
The median PFS for the high vs. low niraparib exposure groups in the HRDpos subset was: 
•  15.7 vs. 9.4 months with HR 0.78 (95% CI of 0.46-1.33) based on steady-state Ctrough 
•  15.4 vs. 9.4 months with HR 0.70 (95% CI of 0.41-1.19) based on steady-state Cmax 
•  16 vs. 9.4 months with HR 0.74 (95% CI of 0.43-1.26) based on steady-state AUCtau. 
During the procedure,n the applicant was requested to provide a Monte-Carlo simulation PK/PD 
study associated with a PTA (Probability Target Attainment) given the POP-PK and the efficacy 
endpoint. 
A population pharmacokinetic model using full profiles from the phase I study PN001 (n=104) and 
sparse samples from the phase III NOVA study (n=408) was developed and was used to perform 
simulations within NONMEM. Data sets of 5000 patients each receiving either 100 mg, 200 mg, or 
300 mg to steady-state were created for the simulations. The final model parameter estimates as 
well as the variability estimates were used for the simulations.  
Figure 6presents a summary of the niraparib AUC for the simulated dose regimens. It 
demonstrates that niraparib exposure bands of the 100 mg, 200 mg, and 300 mg dose groups 
were largely overlapping. These simulation results are consistent with the observed sparse data for 
the NOVA study and with the full profiles from the PN001 study.  
Figure 7 presents the % of patients achieving various AUC values for each simulated dose group. 
In the absence of a definitive exposure threshold needed to maintain efficacy, three AUC bins 
(12,000 ng*hr/mL) are shown. The AUC of 12,000 ng*hr/mL was selected as the target exposure 
for the analysis based on the previous population PK report. In the population PK analysis, the 
median AUC for the exposure response relationship was approximately 12,000 ng*hr/mL in both 
the gBRCA and nongBRCA cohorts. The exposure-response analyses in the population PK report 
showed a trend towards increased efficacy with increased exposure, most notably in the non-
gBRCA cohort. Figure 7 indicates that >80% patients in the 300 mg group and < 50% patients in 
the 200 mg group would achieve exposure higher than the population median. It is important to 
note, that while these data support the recommended starting dose of 300 mg, efficacy was 
maintained in patients in NOVA who were dose reduced per the current dose modification guidance 
in the SmPC.

Exposure-safety 
Patient incidence of treatment-emergent AEs by preferred term and worst grade was summarised 
by descriptive statistics in the two niraparib exposure groups. The relationships between AEs of 
interest, including thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, anemia, nausea, and fatigue and niraparib 
exposure were explored using logistic regression models. The predicted steady-state AUCtau, Cmax 
and Ctrough were tested. Adverse events (≥ Grade 1 and ≥ Grade 3) were evaluated.  
The probability of thrombocytopenia (≥ Grade 3) was not correlated with steady-state Ctrough or 
AUCtau. Similarly, the probability of high grade anemia (≥ Grade 3) was evidently not correlated 
with steady-state Ctrough. There may be a positive trend between these events and Cmax and AUCtau 
although the relationship was not statistically significant. There were no apparent associations 
between niraparib exposure and lower grade thrombocytopenia and anemia as well as incidence of 
the other AEs of interest, neutropenia and fatigue in particular. There is no obvious difference in 
steady-state exposure between the patients who experienced high grade AEs of interest 
(thrombocytopenia, anemia, neutropenia, fatigue), and those who did not during the treatment. 
Graphical and tabular summary of the relationship between patient covariates and safety variables 
demonstrated that of all the key baseline covariates (PLTBL, NEUTBL, HGBBL, WTBL, AGE, ALBBL, 
BILIBL, ASTBL, ALTBL, ALPBL, and LDHBL) and platelet nadir (overall, across all study visits) was 
assessed; only baseline platelets had an impact on platelet nadir. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, there are few studies with thorough PK data presented, however there are several ongoing 
studies with no PK data yet. From the submitted studies with PK data the inter-individual variability 
was moderate to high for the pharmacokinetic parameters. The variability can be exemplified by 
e.g. the mean apparent volume of distribution (Vd/F) of niraparib varying from 1220-2170 L and 
mean t1/2 varying between 36 and 96 hours in different studies. The cause of the observed high 
variability is currently unknown, however is consistent with other drugs of this class, such as 
olaparib and rucaparib. 
Despite that hepatobiliary clearance and renal excretion are the major routes of niraparib 
elimination in humans, dedicated clinical studies investigating the impact of renal or hepatic 
impairment on niraparib have not been submitted.  
The effect of renal impairment was studied in the population pharmacokinetic analyses using 
creatinine clearance as a marker for renal function. Creatinine clearance did not show a significant 
Assessment report  
EMA/648982/2017 
Page 46/122 
  
  
 
effect on the PK of niraparib. No dose adjustment is necessary for patients with mild to moderate 
renal impairment. The pharmacokinetics of niraparib have not been assessed in patients with 
severe renal impairment end-stage renal disease undergoing haemodialysis; niraparib should be 
used with caution in these patients (see sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC). 
Based on population pharmacokinetic modelling, baseline serum albumin, serum aspartate 
aminotransferase, total bilirubin, and aminotransferase levels did not have a clinically important 
effect on niraparib pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild to 
moderate hepatic impairment. The pharmacokinetics of niraparib have not been assessed in 
patients with severe hepatic impairment; niraparib should be used with caution in these patients 
(see sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC). 
In the population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modelling report gender, race, ethnicity, 
body weight, age or age groups showed no significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of niraparib. 
No dose adjustment is necessary for elderly patients (≥ 65 years). 
There is no study of niraparib in children or adults < 30 years old. 
The applicant will continue to thoroughly evaluate the potential impact from the renal and hepatic 
impairment in the clinical studies. 
Niraparib tosylate monohydrate has one chiral center of the S configuration. . Based on available 
data it is reasonable to conclude that neither niraparib nor the major metabolite M1 undergoes 
stereoconversion during the biotransformation in vivo. Based on the current knowledge it is 
unlikely that genetic polymorphism would play an important role in the PK of niraparib. 
The carboxylesterases-catalysed amide hydrolysis is the major primary metabolic pathway, 
followed by the UDP-glucuronosyltransferases-mediated glucuronidation and the other minor 
secondary pathways. The major primary metabolite M1 exhibited a comparable to (AUC and Cmax) 
or possibly slightly higher exposure (AUC) than niraparib, and t 1/2 of M1 to be analogous to the 
parent. However, the pharmacokinetics of M1 are only analysed in single-dose studies 
The specific carboxylesterase and UGT enzymes involved in the metabolism of niraparib and 
metabolites have not been presented. Niraparib is not an inhibitor of UGT 1A1, 1A4, 1A9 and 2B7. 
 An in vitro study to identify CE and UGT enzymes responsible for the metabolism of niraparib and 
M1 is currently ongoing, and data will be updated when available. No dose adjustment for niraparib 
is required when administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to inhibit (e.g. 
itraconazole, ritonavir, and clarithromycin) or induce CYP enzymes (e.g. rifampin, carbamazepine, 
and phenytoin). 
Niraparib is a substrate of the transporters P-gp and BCRP. However, due to its high permeability 
and bioavailability, the risk of clinically relevant interactions with medicinal products that inhibit 
these transporters is unlikely. Therefore, no dose adjustment for Zejula is required when 
administered concomitantly with medicinal products known to inhibit P gp (e.g. amiodarone, 
verapamil) or BCRP (e.g. osimertinib, velpatasvir, and eltrombopag). 
A clinically meaningful interaction related to an inhibition of P-gp and BCRP efflux transporters 
although unlikely, cannot be excluded. Caution is recommended when niraparib is combined with 
substrates of BCRP (irinotecan, rosuvastatin, simvastatin, atorvastatin, and methotrexate). 
The impact of the substrate affinity of niraparib to P-pg with regards to the disposition and 
potential drug interactions have not been discussed. The possible involvement of P-pg in local 
tumour resistance is considered to be low. 
However,  since  inhibition  of  CYP3A4  by  niraparib  cannot  be  ruled  out  in  the  intestine,  caution  is 
recommended  when  niraparib  is  combined  with  active  substances  the  metabolism  of  which  is 
Assessment report  
EMA/648982/2017 
Page 47/122 
  
  
CYP3A4-dependent  and,  notably,  those  having  a  narrow  therapeutic  range  (e.g.  ciclosporin, 
tacrolimus, alfentanil, ergotamine, pimozide, quetiapine, and halofantrine).  
In  addition  since  niraparib  has  been  shown  to  weakly  induce  CYP1A2  in  vitro,  caution  is 
recommended  when  niraparib  is  combined  with  active  substances  the  metabolism  of  which  is 
CYP1A2-dependent  and,  notably,  those  having  a  narrow  therapeutic  range  (e.g.  clozapine, 
theophylline, and ropinirole). 
Niraparib and M1 are not substrates of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OAT1, OAT3 or OCT2. No dose 
adjustment for niraparib is required when administered concomitantly with medicinal products 
known to inhibit OATP1B1 or 1B3 (e.g. gemfibrozil, ritonavir), OCT1 (e.g. dolutegravir) OAT1 (e.g. 
probenecid), OAT3 (e.g. probenecid, diclofenac), or OCT2 (e.g. cimetidine, quinidine) uptake 
transporters. 
As niraparib weakly inhibits OCT1, caution is recommended when it is combined with active 
substances that undergo an uptake transport by OCT1 such as metformin. 
Due to its other pharmacodynamic effects, notably myelosuppression events, caution should be 
taken if niraparib is used in combination with a vaccine, immunosuppressant agents or other 
cytotoxic medicinal products. 
In spite of the in vitro findings, no specific in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were performed. 
The maximum steady state exposures observed on day 21 following multiple 300 mg doses of 
niraparib were 66814 nM·hr and 4368 nM for AUC0-24 and Cmax, respectively. No analysis is 
performed for M1 after multiple doses. 
No dedicated PD study has been submitted. Combined PK/PD and efficacy studies have provided 
some information on the relationship between dose/exposure and response in terms of PFS and 
safety. 
Several PARP-inhibitors resistance mechanisms have been described in the literature (e.g. Pgp 
overexpression, loss of 53BP1). Furthermore, cross-resistance to other anti-cancer agents including 
PARP inhibitors has been reported. 
The rationale for using niraparib was initially only based on the principle of synthetic lethality that 
selectively exploits an acquired deficiency in the DNA repair apparatus in tumour cells. About 50% 
of serous ovarian carcinomas might be HRD and could thus be susceptible to PARP inhibitors 
(Mukhopadhyay 2012). Clinical responses of PARP inhibitors have been documented (although in 
less extent) in platinum-resistance tumours suggesting incomplete crossover of platinum sensitivity 
and PARP inhibitory response (Gelmon et al. 2011, Ledermann et al. 2012). 
The applied indication includes patients with somatic or germline BRCA mutation, and patients with 
or without a competent HR DNA repair apparatus. The mechanism of action has been further 
clarified by the Applicant and provides a rationale for why tumour response is expected also in the 
HR competent patient population. 
Platinum sensitivity is used in the pivotal study to select the target population. Platinum agents 
cause DNA crosslinks which are usually repaired either by nucleotide/BER or HR. Thus, in theory, 
combined therapy should result in synergism. Although no concomitant treatment with 
chemotherapy and niraparib is intended, long-lasting accumulation of platinum agents has been 
reported (Travis et al. 2010). However, to reduce adverse event burden on the patient, niraparib 
maintenance therapy after the patients have received maximum benefit from platinum therapy is a 
reasonable approach as is also the case for the already approved PARP inhibitor olaparib. 
Several PARP-inhibitors resistance mechanisms have been described in the literature. Furthermore, 
cross-resistance to other anti-cancer agents including PARP inhibitors has been reported. This could 
have implications for subsequent use of chemotherapy as well as other PARP inhibitors.

The Applicant has performed a QTc analysis based on single dose data only. The Applicant has 
provided a regression analysis of the QTcF and PK data collected in the phase III NOVA study from 
patients receiving single and multiple doses of 300 mg QD niraparib. The sampling time of 2 hours 
postdose corresponds fairly well to the median Tmax (2.5-4 hours). No baseline comparison has 
been provided. No relationship between higher exposure with QTc was identified.  Niraparib is not 
expected to have a significant effect on QTc. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Niraparib pharmacokinetics are presented, however with some weaknesses. The interindividual 
variability was moderate to high for the pharmacokinetic parameters, and the cause of the 
variability is not known. The specific carboxylesterase and UGT enzymes involved in the 
metabolism of niraparib and metabolites have not been presented. 
Pharmacokinetics of the main metabolite M1 is only presented from single-dose studies. Even 
though the metabolite is not regarded to be active, M1 might contribute to drug-drug interactions 
(see section 4.5 of the SmPC).  
Despite that hepatobiliary clearance and renal excretion are presented as the major routes of 
niraparib elimination in humans, dedicated clinical studies investigating the impact of renal or 
hepatic impairment on niraparib have not been submitted. In vitro, niraparib exerted some 
induction of CYP1A2, was a substrate of P-gp and BCRP, an inhibitor of BCRP, a weak inhibitor of 
OCT1, and a very weak inhibitor of P-gp. M1 may be a substrate of P-gp and BCRP. In spite of the 
in vitro findings, no specific in vivo drug-drug interaction studies were performed. 
Clinical pharmacodynamics (i.e. PARP inhibition, QTc prolongation, exposure-response) have been 
investigated in one phase I study and in the pivotal study. 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to 
pharmacology: 
- The applicant is recommended to submit the ongoing in vitro study to identify CE and UGT 
enzymes responsible for the metabolism of niraparib and M1. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No formal Phase II dose-ranging studies were conducted. The selection of the 300 mg starting dose 
of niraparib for the NOVA study was based on data from the phase I dose-escalating study PN001.  
Study PN001: A Phase I Study of MK-4827 in Patients with Advanced Solid Tumours or 
Hematologic Malignancies 
A multi-centre, open-label, non-randomised, cohort based, dose-escalation and confirmation study 
to establish a recommended Phase II dose (R2PD) based on safety and tolerability, PK and PD in 
patients with advanced and treatment refractory cancer. 
The study included both a dose escalation phase and confirmation scheme to determine the MTD of 
niraparib in patients with advanced solid tumours (part A) and an dose expansion arm to further 
evaluate the selected dose in patients with platinum-resistant, recurrent, HGSOC or prostate 
cancer (part B). Part C and D are only briefly described, as the study was terminated with no/only 
a few patients enrolled in these parts. 
Assessment report  
EMA/648982/2017 
Page 49/122 
  
  
Part A: 
Patients were administred niraparib QD, continuously in 21-day cycles. An accelerated titration 
phase I clinical trial design was used, with 100% dose increments in single patient cohorts, 
beginning with the starting dose of 30 mg QD (i.e. 1/10 of the projected STD10 in rats). Under this 
accelerated scheme, one patient was to be entered per dose level until: 
• 
•  OR a patient experienced a DLT in any cycle, 
•  OR two patients (at any dose level) experienced treatment-related Grade 2 toxicities in any 
a patient demonstrated ≥50% inhibition of PARP activity in PBMCs in Cycle 1, 
cycle. 
Further dose escalations were to follow a modified 3+3 design (Ji et al. 2007) at approximately 
40% dose increments. 
Part B: 
In Part B, patients began treatment at the RP2D of 300 mg QD. Patients took niraparib 
continuously in 21-day cycles. Dose modifications were performed as needed. 
Part C and D: 
In Part D, patients (n=4) began treatment at the RP2D of 300 mg QD. Patients took niraparib 
continuously 28-day cycles with no treatment holiday. No patients were enrolled in part C. 
Results 
Of 142 patients screened, 104 patients with advanced solid tumours were enrolled, including 60 
patients during dose escalation over ten dose levels (30 mg to 400 mg) and 44 during expansion. 
Median age was 59 years, and 70.2% of patients were female. The population was heavily 
pretreated, with a median of five and up to 14 prior lines of therapy. The most common cancers 
represented was ovarian (n=48), prostate (n=23), and breast cancer (n=13). Overall, patients 
remained on treatment for a median of 59 days (10 to 590), and for a median of 3 cycles (1 to 
28). Median duration of therapy for the 300 mg dose was 67 days (10-524). 
The dose escalation stage (Part A) determined that 400 mg exceeded the MTD, thus a MTD of 
300mg was determined for niraparib. 
Sixty-one percent of patients required a dose interruption, reduction or withdrawal (50%, 33% and 
7% of patients, respectively) due to an adverse event. 
The PK profile supported a once daily dosing (dose proportional, terminal half-life 30-40 hrs). Fifty-
six of patients were evaluated in the PD analysis. A significant PARP inhibition were seen at doses 
≥ 80mg QD which supports a dose reduction scheme that allows patients to get the highest 
tolerable dose to start, but remain on a potentially efficacious dose if AE require dose interruption 
and reduction. For efficacy results, please refer to section 2.2.3 on primary pharmacology. 
PopPK analysis 
Individual niraparib exposure parameters were generated from the popPK analysis in order to 
explore the exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety relationships. The Applicant concluded that the 
300 mg dose was supported by the efficacy and safety data from study PR-30-5011-C.

Randomization was to occur within 8 weeks of the last dose of the final platinum-containing 
regimen. 
Patients were administered with 300 mg niraparib or placebo (marked as equivalent dose) QD 
orally in continuous 28-day cycles. Drug was supplied as 100 mg niraparib capsules or appearance-
matched placebo capsules. 
Dose interruption and/or reduction could be implemented at any time for any grade toxicity 
considered intolerable by the patient. Treatment was required to be interrupted for any non-
hematologic AE that was Grade 3 or 4, per National Cancer Institute (NCI)-CTCAE v.4.02 if the 
Investigator considered the event to be related to administration of study drug. If toxicity was 
appropriately resolved to baseline or Grade 1 or less within 28 days, the patient was allowed to 
restart treatment with study drug, but with a dose level reduction (300 mg to 200 mg). If the 
event recurred at a similar or worse grade, the patient’s treatment was again to be interrupted; 
upon event resolution, a further dose reduction was required (200 mg to 100 mg). No more than 2 
dose reductions were permitted for any patient.

Objectives 
The primary study objective was to evaluate the efficacy of niraparib compared to placebo as 
maintenance treatment of patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer who were in 
response to platinum-based chemotherapy, as assessed by progression-free survival (PFS). The 
objective was independently evaluated in a cohort of patients with germline breast cancer 
susceptibility gene (BRCA) mutation tumors (gBRCAmut cohort) and in a cohort of patients with 
high-grade serous or high-grade predominantly serous histology, but who were not gBRCAmut 
carriers (non-gBRCAmut cohort). 
Secondary efficacy objectives of the main study included the evaluation of additional measures of 
clinical benefit, including patient-reported outcomes (PROs), time to first subsequent treatment 
(TFST), Chemotherapy-free interval (CFI), progression-free survival 2 (PFS2), time to second 
subsequent treatment (TSST), and overall survival (OS). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Descriptions of the study endpoints are presented in the table below:

Patient-reported outcome (PRO) 
The primary efficacy endpoint PFS, defined as the time from the date 
of treatment randomization to the date of first documentation of 
progression or death by any cause, was assessed by IRC per RECIST 
v.1.1 criteria. The independent oncologist in addition reviewed 
relevant clinical data, including anatomic site(s) of prior radiotherapy, 
on-study 
cytology and/or histology results, on-study interventions (surgery, 
radiotherapy, etc), additional diagnostic test results, CA-125 values 
and clinical signs and symptoms of disease progression. 
Date of randomization in the current study to the start date of the 
first subsequent anti-cancer therapy after maintenance treatment 
The time from the last platinum therapy dose until initiation of the 
next anti-cancer therapy (excluding maintenance therapy) 
Date of randomization in the current study to the earlier date of 
assessment of progression on the next anti-cancer therapy following 
study treatment or death by any cause. If progression on next anti-
cancer therapy was not determined, but the patient received a second 
subsequent anti-cancer therapy the date of the next line of therapy 
was used as a surrogate for PD.

Clinical visits occur every 4 weeks ± 3 days and tumour assessment via CT or MRI scans will occur 
every 8 weeks ± 7 days until progression. 
Progressive disease (PD) was determined if at least 1 of the following 3 criteria was met: 
1. Tumour assessment by CT/MRI showed PD according to RECIST v.1.1 criteria. 
Assessment report

2. Additional diagnostic tests (e.g., histology/cytology, ultrasound techniques, endoscopy, PET) 
identified new lesions or determined that existing lesions qualified for unequivocal PD and CA-125 
progression, according to GCIG criteria. 
3. Definitive clinical signs and symptoms of PD unrelated to non-malignant or iatrogenic causes 
(intractable cancer-related pain; malignant bowel obstruction/worsening dysfunction; or 
unequivocal symptomatic worsening of ascites or pleural effusion) and CA-125 progression 
according to GCIG criteria were present. 
Note: CA-125 progression alone was not to be considered disease progression; at least 1 of the 
criteria defined above was necessary to determine PD. 
In addition, exploratory endpoint analysis were conducted 
• 
• 
• 
on patient subsets based on intrinsic and extrinsic factors  
on primary and secondary efficacy endpoints on the various mutational subgroups within 
the non-gBRCAmut cohort  
to assess the treatment effect on the primary endpoint of PFS in patients whose cancer had 
BRCA mutations present in their tumour (tBRCA). 
Sample size 
The gBRCAmut and non-gBRCAmut cohorts were treated as 2 independent cohorts/studies where 
each cohort was allocated 1-sided alpha = 0.025. For the sample size calculations, the assumptions 
used were based on published data provided for a placebo controlled trial of olaparib against 
placebo in a similar maintenance setting. 
The gBRCAmut cohort sample size was determined based on the assumption that niraparib will 
result in an improvement in median PFS of 4.8 to 9.6 months (corresponding to an HR of 0.50 for 
niraparib relative to placebo). 98 PFS events will provide 90% power assuming a 2:1 
randomization.  
Sample size for the HRD positive subgroup in the non-gBRCAmut cohorts was determined based on 
the same PFS assumption as used for the gBRCAmut cohort: 98 PFS events will provide 90% power 
assuming a 2:1 randomization (Amendment 6). The overall non-gBCRAmut cohort sample size was 
determined to maintain the intended hierarchical testing procedure under the assumption that 
approximately 40% of the non-gBRCAmut cohort is expected to be classified as HRD positive. With 
a total of approximately 310 patients in the non-gBCRAmut cohort, the expected number of HRD 
positive patients would be 130. 
In total the study planned to include approximately 490 patients. 
Randomisation 
Patients were to be randomized separately within each cohort based on results from the Integrated 
BRACAnalysis test using a 2:1 allocation of niraparib to placebo. Randomization was stratified by 
the following factors: 
• 
Time to progression after the penultimate platinum therapy before study enrolment (6 to 
<12 months and ≥12 months) 
•  Use of bevacizumab in conjunction with the penultimate or last platinum regimen (yes/no)  
•  Best response during the last platinum regimen (CR and PR).

Blinding (masking) 
Study patients, Investigators, study coordinators, and TESARO’s study team and its 
representatives were blinded to the identity of the assigned treatment from the time of 
randomization until final database lock. 
Statistical methods 
The study objective was independently evaluated in a cohort of patients with germline breast 
cancer susceptibility gene (BRCA) mutation tumors (gBRCAmut cohort) and in a cohort of patients 
with high-grade serous or high-grade predominantly serous histology, but who were not gBRCAmut 
carriers (non-gBRCAmut cohort). 
•  Hypothesis 
The primary statistical hypothesis for this study is to test for superiority of niraparib to placebo in 
PFS within each cohort using a stratified log-rank test. 
• H0: HR (niraparib/placebo) ≥ 1.  
• Ha: HR (niraparib/placebo) < 1. 
The statistical analysis of the primary endpoint of PFS for the non-gBRCAmut cohort was performed 
in a hierarchical manner, with statistical testing for the HRDpos group, as determined with the 
myChoice HRD test, performed first, followed by statistical testing of the overall non-gBRCAmut 
cohort, only if the first test on the HRDpos group was statistically significant. Therefore, the 
HRDpos group is referred to as the primary efficacy population within the non-gBRCAmut cohort. 
Prospectively planned analysis 
A stratified log-rank test using the randomization stratification factors was used to calculate the 
key efficacy endpoints. HR and 2-sided 95% CI were derived from a stratified Cox proportional 
hazards model and survivor function was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. In order to 
estimate PRO a mixed-effects growth-curve model adjusting for fixed and random covariates was 
used. 
Within each cohort, the overall family-wise Type 1 error rate on the primary efficacy endpoint of 
PFS was controlled at 1-sided 0.025 significance level. A hierarchical testing method was used in 
the non-gBRCAmut cohort. First, the group of patients who were determined to have HRDpos 
tumours was analyzed for a statistically significant treatment group difference in PFS by the 
stratified log-rank test at alpha-level 0.025 1-sided. If that test was statistically significant, then 
the overall non-gBRCAmut cohort was evaluated by the same method, also at alpha-level 0.025 1-
sided (this testing strategy was introduced with amendment 4). 
The planned number of events was met on 30 May 2016, the data cut-off point for the study 
report, with 103 PFS events observed in the gBRCAmut cohort and 101 PFS events in HRDpos 
subgroup. At that time, enrollment was complete with 109 patients remaining on treatment and 
273 in the follow-up phase.  
All patients were to be followed off treatment every 3 months for subsequent anti-cancer 
treatment, including outcome of such therapy, any new malignancies, and survival status. 
Sensitivity analyses 
The ITT analysis is primary while the PP analysis is a sensitivity analyses.  
Several sensitivity analyses were performed on PFS, using the ITT population: 
Assessment report  
EMA/648982/2017 
Page 55/122 
  
  
• Unstratified log-rank testing along with Cox regression modeling using treatment only. 
• Investigator assessment of PFS using a stratified log-rank and associated Cox regression model. 
• An IRC analysis using only radiological assessment (RECIST v1.1) as progression. 
• An IRC analysis treating censors due to subsequent anti-cancer treatment, discontinuation due to 
any reason, or missed tumour assessments as events. For this analysis, the date of progression 
was imputed as the date of initiation of subsequent anti-cancer treatment, the date of 
discontinuation, or the date of the last non-missing tumour assessment (in cases where the patient 
had no further assessments). 
• Use of the scheduled assessment date to show progression if the actual assessment was 
conducted after the scheduled date and showed PD. This was done only for progression, not for 
censored observations, ie, if the last available observation was after a scheduled assessment and 
indicated that progression had not occurred, then that observation was used in this sensitivity 
analysis. 
An additional sensitivity analysis has been performed where the patient who started subsequent 
anti-cancer treatment was considered as a progression and the event date was set as the date of 
initiation of the first subsequent anti-cancer treatment. 
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 553 patients (ITT population) were enrolled in the NOVA study where 372 were 
randomized to niraparib and 181 to placebo. The study was designed to evaluate niraparib as 
maintenance treatment in two independent cohorts of patients: those with germline BRCA mutation 
(gBRCAmut cohort) and those who were not germline BRCA mutation carriers (non-gBRCAmut 
cohort).

Figure 9 Patient disposition flowchart - NOVA study 
Prior to randomization, a blood sample from each patient was tested centrally for germline BRCA 
mutation using Myriad’s Integrated BRACAnalysis test. Based on the results from this test patients 
were divided into two study cohorts; gBRCAmut and non-gBRCAmut cohort. 
During the conduct of the NOVA study, the myChoice HRD test was developed and identified as the 
biomarker classifier to define a patient population enriched for niraparib sensitivity in the non-
gBRCAmut cohort. Prior to unblinding of the study, tumours of patients were tested for the 
presence of HRD using this experimental HRD test, which evaluates three indirect measures of 
tumour genome instability: loss of heterozygosity, telomeric allelic imbalance (TAI), and large-
scale state transitions. 
In order to determine HRD status as positive (HRDpos) or negative (HRDneg), tumour tissue 
samples from patients in both cohorts were evaluated using the test. Patients in this cohort were 
subsequently dived into subgroups (HRDpos/HRDneg) for data analysis.  
Testing for tBRCA mutation and homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) was performed using 
the HRD test on tumour tissue obtained at the time of initial diagnosis or at the time of recurrence.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The main changes in the five global amendments to the protocol are described below: 
•  Amendment 1(date amendment final: 03 May 2013) 
−  Disease progression (PFS, the primary efficacy endpoint) was originally required to be 
confirmed objectively by blinded central review in conjunction with RECIST v.1.1. Clinical 
criteria were added to the means of confirmation (ie, RECIST, clinical criteria, and blinded 
central review). 
−  QTc Analyses were added to indicate that a formal analysis of ECG variables would be 
conducted and that a separate population PK analysis plan would be written to describe the 
relationship of ECG and PK variables. 
−  PROs were to continue to be collected even after a patient discontinued treatment, 
regardless of progression status.  
•  Amendment 2 and 3 (date amendment final: 09 April 2014) 
−  The Integrated BRACAnalysis was specified as the diagnostic test to determine germline 
BRCA mutation status; prior to this, local BRCA tests could be used.  
−  The description of the Integrated BRACAnalysis was updated to include that DNA from the 
submitted sample(s) was going to be stored and could be used at a later time for additional 
biomarker testing, including the potential to bridge to candidate companion diagnostic 
assays.  
•  Amendment 4 (date amendment final: 04 Dec 2014) 
− 
− 
In addition to germline BRCA testing, text was added in this amendment to indicate that 
patients would be tested (centrally) to classify their HRD status, and to indicate the timing 
of that testing. 
It was further specified that HRDpos patients in the non-gBRCAmut cohort would be 
evaluated first for PFS, followed by all non-gBRCAmut patients.  
−  Statistical methods were updated to indicate that superiority of niraparib relative to placebo 
in PFS would be evaluated in the gBRCAmut cohort using a 1-sided alpha equal to 0.025.  
−  Concordance of a candidate companion HRD diagnostic test compared with the HRD 
diagnostic test used in this study would be assessed, if needed, and baseline samples for 
HRD analyses were to be collected and archived for possible bridging the study’s HRD test 
to a candidate companion HRD diagnostic test.  
−  The sample size for evaluation of PFS was expanded to include the original 180 gBRCAmut 
patients, and up to 310 patients randomized to the non-gBRCAmut cohort. Sample size 
increase, including statistical assumptions, was explained in the Sample Size 
Considerations section of the protocol. 
•  Amendment 5 (date amendment final: 11 Sep 2015) 
−  Guidance on monitoring patients for new events of MDS/AML and the follow-up of patients 
with suspected MDS/AML was added to the protocol. 
•  Amendment 6 (date amendment final: 09 Mar 2016) 
−  Changes were made to ensure that the gBRCAmut cohort would not be overpowered to 
detect a small PFS difference and to provide evidence needed to determine whether there 
might have been a differential response to niraparib in the patient population with 
Assessment report  
EMA/648982/2017 
Page 58/122 
  
  
gBRCAmut tumours vs HRDpos/ sBRCAmut tumours vs HRDpos/BRCAwt. Thus, the power 
of the gBRCAmut cohort from >95% to 90% allowed for analysis for both of the cohorts 
simultaneously. The new sample size for this test was determined to be approximately 100 
PFS events in the gBRCAmut cohort, to maintain 90% power. 
−  Secondary objectives were added: TFST and TSST.  
−  An interim analysis of the gBRCAmut cohort, planned to follow approximately 85 PFS 
events, was deleted from the protocol, since the timing of these events would 
approximately coincide with the current planned analysis of data.  
Protocol deviation 
Overall, 36 (7%) of the 553 patients had a major protocol deviation.  
Table 17 Major Protocol Deviations by Cohort (ITT Population) - NOVA study 
Minor protocol violations 
42 out of 553 (7.6%) patients had tumors with at least one dimension that measured more than 2 
cm by Independent Radiology Review (IRC).

The per protocol (PP) population was defined as all patients randomized in the main study that did 
not have major protocol deviations that might have significantly impacted the interpretation of 
efficacy results.  
The safety (SAF) population was defined as all patients who ingested any amount of study drug. 
The safety population was to be the primary analysis population for the safety and drug exposure 
analyses.

•  Overall Survival  
As of the data cut-off for the primary analysis of PFS, the OS data were immature. At that time, a 
total of 24 patients in the gBRCAmut cohort had died, including 16 (12%) of the 138 patients 
randomized to niraparib and 8 (12%) of the 65 patients randomized to placebo; thus, median OS 
was not reached for the ITT population in either randomized treatment arm with an HR of 0.91 
(95% CI: 0.360, 2.282). Patients continue to be followed for OS and updated information will be 
provided in the final CSR. 
•  Patient related outcomes 
Symptoms of ovarian cancer were assessed using the FOSI and QOL was assessed using the EQ-
5D-5L health utility index and the visual analogue scale. Baseline symptoms and QOL were 
equivalent between placebo and niraparib patients in the cohort. Similar results were observed 
throughout the study for the gBRCAmut cohort with no significant differences observed during the 
maintenance (treatment) period or at post progression (p>0.05 for each assessment and each 
treatment arm on each patient outcome). Further, KM analysis for FOSI time to symptom 
worsening found no statistically significant difference between niraparib and placebo (log rank 
p>0.05). 
non-gBRCAmut cohort 
•  Primary endpoint-Progression-free survival (PFS) 
A hierarchical testing method was used: The results from the HRDpos group of the non-gBRCAmut 
cohort were significant and the overall cohort was therefore evaluated by the same method.  
HRDpos group/non-gBRCAmut cohort 
For the HRDpos group, the study met its primary efficacy objective; maintenance treatment with 
niraparib prolonged PFS by 9.1 months compared to placebo. Median PFS as determined by the IRC

For the non-gBRCAmut cohort overall, the study met its primary efficacy objective; maintenance 
treatment with niraparib prolonged PFS by 5.4 months compared to placebo in patients with 
platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer. Median PFS as determined by the IRC was 9.3 months 
in the niraparib arm and 3.9 months in the placebo arm with a HR of 0.45 (95% CI: 0.338, 0.607)

•  Sensitivity analysis 
Results of the sensitivity analyses for the non-gBRCAmut cohort (HRDpos and overall groups) were 
consistent with the primary efficacy results for these groups. In each analysis, maintenance 
treatment with niraparib prolonged PFS compared to placebo with HRs all ≤0.66.

Overall Survival  
As of the data cutoff for the primary analysis of PFS, the OS data were immature in the non-
gBRCAmut cohort. At that time, a total of 71 patients in the cohort had died, including 44 (19%) of 
234 patients randomized to niraparib and 27 (23%) of 116 patients randomized to placebo. Data 
were censored for over 75% of patients in both treatment arms. Median OS was not estimated for 
the ITT population in either randomized treatment arm; HR was 0.74 (95% CI: 0.452, 1.200). 
Follow-up continues for all patients who were ongoing on study at the time of the data cut.

non-gBRCAmut cohort with no significant differences observed during the maintenance (treatment) 
period or at post-progression (p>0.05 for each assessment and each treatment arm on each

•  HRDpos/sBRCAmut 
Among patients in the HRDpos subgroup that had a somatic BRCA mutation (sBRCAmut, N = 47), 
median PFS was longer in the niraparib arm (20.9 months) compared to the placebo arm (11.0 
months) with an HR of 0.27 (95% CI: 0.081, 0.903) (p=0.0248).

the KM curves for the 2 treatment arms in the HRDneg group shows divergence of the curves after 
approximately 4 months with the niraparib arm above that of the placebo arm. The estimated 
proportion of patients in the HRDneg group who had not progressed or died at 6 months was 54% 
in the niraparib arm compared to 31% in the placebo arm and at 12 months was 27% compared to 
7%.

Ancillary analyses 
Pooled efficacy analysis across the gBRCAmut and non-gBRCAmut cohorts 
Given the positive outcome for niraparib maintenance treatment in both cohorts of the NOVA 
study, the data were pooled for analysis to allow for an evaluation of the treatment effect in a 
population of patients regardless of BRCA biomarker status. In addition, pooling of the data across 
cohorts allows for a larger and more robust dataset for the assessment of the secondary endpoints, 
including PFS2 and OS.

Progression free survival 
Median PFS as determined by the IRC for the pooled cohorts was 11.3 months among the 372 
patients in the niraparib arm compared to 4.7 months among the 181 patients in the placebo arm 
and with a HR of 0.38 (95% CI: 0.303, 0.488), (p<0.0001).

PFS2-PFS interval in the pooled cohorts 
At data cutoff 62% and 55% of the data for the PFS2 analysis were censored in both cohorts for 
patients in the niraparib and placebo arms, respectively. Hence, an analysis was performed to 
evaluate the difference between PFS2 and PFS (PFS2-PFS) in all randomized patients. The median 
difference between PFS2 and PFS was 9.0 months for the niraparib arm and 10.3 months for the 
placebo arm with hazard ratio – 1.02 (95% cI: 0765 , 1.349; (p=0.9183).

Overall survival data were immature at the time of the data cutoff with >80% of patients in both 
treatment arms alive and therefore censored in the analysis. Median OS for the pooled analysis had 
not been reached in either treatment arm; the HR (95% CI) was 0.73 (0.480, 1.125) (p=0.1545).

An additional analysis was performed in the NOVA study to assess the treatment effect on PFS for 
patients from both study cohorts with tumour BRCA mutations; germline and somatic. In this group 
of patients, niraparib prolonged PFS by 15.2 months compared to placebo.

The analysis of PFS based on IRC assessment for age group 65-74 for gBRCAmut cohort and non-
gBRCAmut cohort was submitted by the applicant (data not shown). The results were consistent 
with observations in the overall population, indicating longer PFS for patients who received 
maintenance therapy with niraparib compared to those who received placebo in the older patient 
population. 
Supportive study(ies) 
No supportive studies are included.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
No formal Phase II dose-ranging studies were conducted. The selection of the 300 mg starting dose 
of niraparib for the NOVA study was based on data from the phase I dose-escalating study PN001. 
Niraparib is a non-cytotoxic compound and the traditional dose-finding approach through the 
determination of the MTD may not be appropriate. Despite absence of DLT conventionally defined 
by grade (3)4-5 events, there was a need to reduce the initial starting dose in a very high 
percentage of patients in both phase I and pivotal studies.

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The applicant has submitted data from a single pivotal trial. The NOVA study is a phase III, double-
blinded, randomized, placebo controlled, multicenter, global clinical trial. The primary objective was 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of niraparib as maintenance treatment for patients with 
platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer who had received at least 2 platinum-based regimens 
and were in response to their last platinum-based chemotherapy. The NOVA trial was designed to 
show superiority using 2:1 allocation of niraparib to placebo in two different cohorts; germline 
BRCA cohort and non-germline BRCA cohort. This is an acceptable patient distribution between the 
two treatment arms and use of placebo was acceptable at the time of study start. 
The germline BRCA cohort includes patients with a germline BRCA mutation only. The non-germline 
BRCA cohort contains patients which are HRD positive with somatic BRCA mutation (N=47), HRD 
positive with wild type BRCA (N=115) and HRD negative (N=134). 
According to the inclusion criteria of the NOVA study, patients were considered to be platinum 
sensitive if they had achieved a CR or PR for more than 6 months. These patients are not 
considered platinum-sensitive according to NCCN criteria.  
The patients were randomized separately in each cohort based on stratification by time to 
progression after the penultimate platinum therapy before study enrolment (6 to < 12 months and 
>12 months), use of bevacizumab in the penultimate or last platinum regimen and best response 
during last platinum treatment (CR or PR). These are clinically relevant stratification factors, but 
based on scientific advice by CHMP bevacizumab, was not to be used as prior maintenance 
treatment as platinum sensitivity was characterized prior to the introduction of maintenance 
therapy. Nevertheless, subgroup analysis showed no difference between patients pretreated and 
patients not pretreated with bevacizumab. 
The rationale for selecting a platinum sensitive/responsive patient population is well argued and 
sensible as these patients are most likely to benefit from PARP inhibition. Sensitivity to platinum 
adducts indicate deficiency in HRD with reduced ability to repair DNA damage. Hence, platinum 
sensitivity is a clinical indicator of sensitivity to PARP inhibitors and thus, the inclusion criteria for 
NOVA required patients to have ovarian cancer sensitive to platinum-based treatment as 
demonstrated by PFS >6 months on their penultimate platinum-based regimen. In addition the 
platinum sensitive population was assigned to two different cohorts based on their germline BRCA 
mutation status to further enrich for the most potent responders. Taken together, this allows for 
analysis of subgroups of patients believed to have the most benefit of niraparib treatment. This 
pre-enrichment strategy is also supported by another clinical study where the PARP inhibitor 
olaparib was tested. 
The myChoice HRD test has been developed in parallel with the clinical development of niraparib 
and was intended to be used for determination of HRD status in patients´ tumours. Thus, the 
protocol was amended to incorporate the MyChoice HRD test to classify the HRD status of the 
patients in the non-gBRCAmut cohort. Patients were, based on the test results allocated to the 
HRDpos or HRDneg subpopulation.  
However, there are yet no other available clinical data for validation of the test except for a 
Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) analysis which concluded that the test after all cannot be 
used to select patients suitable for niraparib treatment. The possible reasons why the test failed to 
define eligible patients in the NOVA study were presented during the procedure. These relates to i) 
probability  that the test misses some individual tumours that should have been classified as HRD 
positives (false HRD negative), ii) the test might not capture all genes that play a role in the HR 
pathway, iii) high PARP-1 expression in the tumour. Based on the totality of these arguments the 
HRD test is considered not to be suitable to define eligible patients for niraparib treatment. 
Although there are limitations about the test, the results in patients HRD positive and HRD 
Assessment report

negative together with information about the test and its limitations have been reflected in section 
5.1 of SmPC). 
Selecting PFS as primary endpoint was accepted by the CHMP in scientific advice as long as there 
would be no signs of inferior PFS2 or OS and an overall positive benefit-risk assessment.  In the 
NOVA study, PFS is supported by several secondary endpoints with OS and PFS2 being the most 
relevant for study population. PRO has been included as a secondary endpoint. A combination of 
favourable PRO and PFS data could support approval as long as no detrimental effect on PFS2 or 
OS is observed.  
In general, the study is well-designed and in line with the scientific advice provided by CHMP. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The data cutoff date for the NOVA study was 30 May 2016 with a database lock date of 20 Jun 
2016. At that time, a total of 553 patients (ITT population) had been enrolled; 372 were 
randomized to the niraparib arm and 181 to the placebo arm. Two hundred and three (203)  
patients were randomized into the gBRCAmut cohort and 350 patients randomized into the non-
gBRCAmut cohort. Among the 350 patients in the non-gBRCAmut cohort, 162 had tumours that 
were HRD positive and 134 were HRD negative. For 54 of the patients the HRD status was not 
determined. Reasons why HRD status could not be determined include inadequate formalin-fixed 
tumour samples and tumour content of samples being less than 20%. 
Baseline characteristics were generally well distributed between the cohorts and the treatment 
arms. The age distribution in the gBRCAmut cohort was slightly lower than for the non-gBRCAmut 
cohort. Also, in the gBRCAmut cohort there is a slight bias between the two arms for the BRCA2 
mutation with 10% more patients allocated to the niraparib arm as compared to placebo. This 
latter point could potentially affect the primary analysis for this cohort towards longer median PFS 
since these patients have been found to have better survival and therapeutic response (Guoyan et 
al, 2012). The treatment groups were also generally well balanced in the two cohorts with regards 
to the total number of previous chemotherapy regimens. gBRCAm patients were generally more 
exposed to platinum treatments than non-gBRCAm patients; i.e. non-gBRCA mutated patients 
were previously mainly treated by only 2 platinum lines (~75%) vs ~ 57% for gBRCA mutated 
patients.  
The study demonstrated significant improvement in median PFS for the niraparib arm of both 
cohorts and also for the HRDpos and the overall groups in the non-gBRCAmut cohort as compared 
to the placebo arm. The largest effect was obtained for the gBRCA cohort with a median 
prolongation of 15.5 months (HR = 0.27). In the sensitivity analysis the median PFS for the 
niraparib arm is reduced from 21 months in the primary analysis to 14.8 months in the investigator 
assessment and 11.2 months in the limited censoring analysis. The difference in median PFS 
between the assessments likely reflects differences in censoring rules (and thus event rates). 
Therefore, as requested, different sensitivity analyses have been performed to evaluate the 
robustness of the primary efficacy results. HR data from these analyses are consistent with the 
primary IRC analysis, whereas median (months) PFS data are similar to the investigator assessed 
PFS value. To reflect this, data from the investigator assessment sensitivity analysis has been 
included in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
In the non-gBRCAmut cohort, the median PFS is 12.9 months in the HRDpos group and 9.3 months 
in the overall group for the niraparib treated patients. Also the HRDneg group shows favourable 
PFS with a median prolongation of 3.1 months.  All three groups demonstrate beneficial HR values 
(<0.60). Moreover, the difference in median PFS in the primary IRC analysis and the sensitivity 
analysis is far less pronounced for the non-gBRCAmut cohort (HRDpos/overall), and within 
acceptable variation. As per today, and based on the conclusion above on the HRD test, there are 
Assessment report  
EMA/648982/2017 
Page 88/122 
  
  
no biomarker tests that can be used to correctly separate the HRDneg patients from the HRDpos 
patients. 
The Kaplan-Meier plots for the 2 treatment arms show early divergence of the curves, with the 
niraparib curve consistently above that of placebo, as well as sustained separation in the curves 
throughout the observation period in both the gBRCAmut cohort and the overall non-gBRCAmut 
cohort . The probability of remaining progression-free at 12 months was estimated to be 27% in 
the niraparib arm and 7% in the placebo arm. At 18 months, the probability of remaining 
progression-free was 19% in the niraparib arm and 7% in the placebo arm.  
A positive treatment effect was observed in all subgroups indicates that all patients with relapsed 
platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer experienced clinical benefit from treatment. Currently there are 
no means of identifying patients that are not sensitive to niraparib. Thus, prior platinum sensitivity 
seems to be the only clinical indicator for selection of patients to niraparib (PARP) treatment as 
reflected in the indication. Results for the secondary efficacy endpoints were consistent with the 
primary efficacy endpoint in the gBRCAmut cohort showing a treatment effect for niraparib 
compared to placebo for TFST, CFI and PFS2.  
Next-line therapies (both chemotherapy and maintenance) will affect, PFS2 and OS of both arms. 
In the gBRCAmut cohort, the reported difference in PFS prolongation between the niraparib and the 
placebo arm is 15.5 months in the primary PFS analysis and 6.3 months in the PFS2 analysis. In 
the non-gBRCAmut cohort, the reported difference in PFS prolongation between the niraparib and 
the placebo arm is 5.4 months in the primary PFS analysis and 3 months in the PFS2 analysis.  
Overall, the number of patients receiving any subsequent anticancer therapy was higher in the 
placebo arm as compared to the niraparib arm for both the gBRCAmut cohort (64.6% vs 
39.1%,respectively) and the non-gBRCAmut cohort overall (69.8% vs 55.6%, respectively) and 
could explain some of the differences observed for PFS and PFS2. In relation to the PFS2 endpoint, 
data are immature with 72 % of patients censored in the niraparib arm and 57% in the placebo 
arm.  
Clinical data are not available in patients with ECOG performance status 2 to 4. 
The efficacy of niraparib in children and adolescents below 18 years of age has not yet been 
established. 
The applicant is recommended to submit updated PFS2 and OS data from the NOVA study when 
they are available. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Positive treatment effect has been demonstrated in both the gBRCA and the non-gBRCA cohort of 
the NOVA study. There is some uncertainty related to the possible differences in size of the effect 
in non-gBRCAmut subpopulations. However, there are currently no means of identifying patients 
that are sensitive to platinum but not sensitive to niraparib. Based on this, efficacy of niraparib is 
considered demonstrated in patients with both gBRCA and non-gBRCA ovarian cancer who are in 
response to platinum based chemotherapy.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The primary data to support the safety of treatment with niraparib in the proposed indication are 
derived from the NOVA main study (PR-30-5011-C) in which 546 patients with ovarian cancer 
received at least one dose of study treatment, including 367 who received niraparib and 179 
received placebo. Key supportive safety information is available from 384 ovarian cancer patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/648982/2017 
Page 89/122 
  
  
treated in 4 open-label, single-arm studies or sub-studies: the Phase 1 Study PN001 (104 patients 
total, 50 with ovarian cancer), the Phase 2 Study PR-30-5020-C (QUADRA, 291 patients), and the 
2 sub-studies of NOVA, PR-30-5011-C1-QTC (26 patients) and PR-30-5011-C2-FE (17 patients); 
data from these studies have been pooled for analysis. This single pool of studies provides an 
evaluation of the safety of niraparib in women receiving treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer and 
is designated the Ovarian Cancer Treatment (OCT) pool. Five additional studies with niraparib in 
other indications contributed with safety data Table 22. 
Patient exposure 
Overall, the entire clinical safety programme includes an evaluation of safety across a total of 854 
patients who received at least 1 dose of niraparib administered as a monotherapy dose of 3x100 
mg (capsules), in line with the proposal being sought. In the entire safety population, 277 subjects 
(75.5%) continued treatment with niraparib for ≥6 to <12 months and 150 subjects (40.9%) for 
≥12 months at the data cut-off date of 30/05/2016. In the placebo-controlled NOVA study, 367 
patients were exposed to at least one dose of niraparib, 245 subjects (66.8%) for ≥6 to <12 
months and 163 subjects (44.4%) for ≥12 months at the data cut-off date. 
The most commonly used dose in naraprib-treated patients in the NOVA trial was 200 mg. 
In the NOVA study, the mean (SD) duration of treatment in the safety analysis set (SAF 
Population, N=546; n=367 on niraparib, n=179 on placebo) was longer in the niraparib arm with 
299.9 (210.89) days equivalent to 11.0 (7.66) 28-days cycles compared to placebo with 212.5 
(163.79) days corresponding to 7.9 (5.93) cycles. The median (range) overall treatment exposure 
from first to last dose was 250 days (~9 cycles; 1.0, 815.0) in the niraparib arm and 163 days (~6 
cycles; 12.0, 926.0) in the placebo arm. Hence, the difference in duration of exposure was 
approximately 3 months between the two treatment arms. The mean (SD) dose intensity (sum of 
the daily doses actually consumed divided by total duration) was 194.98 (69.355) mg/day in the 
niraparib arm and 289.54 (25.656) mg/day in the placebo arm. Consequently, the patients in the 
niraparib and placebo group received a mean (SD) relative dose intensity of 64.99 (23.118) and 
96.51 (8.552) percentage, respectively. 
In the gBRCAmut cohort, the median number of treatment cycles was higher in the niraparib arm 
than the placebo arm (14 and 7 cycles, respectively). More patients in the niraparib group 
continued treatment for more than 12 months than patients in the placebo group (54.4% and 
16.9% respectively).  
In the overall non-gBRCAmut cohort, the median number treatment cycles was higher in the 
niraparib arm than in the placebo arm (8 and 5 cycles, respectively). More patients in the niraparib 
group continued treatment for more than 12 months than patients in the placebo group (34.2% 
and 21.1%, respectively. 
A high proportion of patients in both treatment arms had received 3 or more prior lines of 
chemotherapy, including 39% (146/372) and 41% (74/181) of the patients in the niraparib and 
placebo arms, respectively. In comparison, the patients across the OCT pool were more heavily 
pre-treated for their underlying ovarian cancer with 92% (353/384) of the patients who had 
received 3 or more lines of prior chemotherapy. Notably, this was an inclusion criterion in the 
QUADRA study and the majority of the patients in Study PN001 and the FE sub-study had received 
more than 4 prior lines. 
Adverse events 
Most patients in both treatment arms of the NOVA study experienced at least 1 AE, including all 
367 patients (100%) who received niraparib and 96% (171/179) who received placebo. Overall, 
Assessment report  
EMA/648982/2017 
Page 90/122 
  
  
the incidence of treatment-related AEs was 98% in the niraparib arm and 71% in the placebo arm. 
The incidence of CTCAE Grade 3/4 AEs (74% vs 23%), SAEs (30% vs 15%), any related SAEs 
(17% vs 1%), treatment interruption (67% vs 15%), dose reduction (69% vs 5%), and 
discontinuation (15% vs 2%) due to AEs was higher in the niraparib arm compared to the placebo 
arm. There were no on-treatment deaths reported during the study. However, three deaths due to 
MDS that occurred in the post-treatment period, 1 in the niraparib arm and 2 in the placebo arm, 
were assessed as treatment-related by the Investigators. 
Common adverse events 
AEs reported in ≥10% of patients in either treatment arm are summarized for the Safety 
Population (SAF Population) in the NOVA study in Table 47. 
The pattern of AEs is similar to that observed for olaparib, a PARP inhibitor approved in EU for 
platinum-sensitive recurrent BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer, except that thrombocytopenia and 
constipation are reported more commonly, and hypertension constitute a new safety signal for 
niraparib.

The most frequently reported AEs overall in the OCT pool were consistent with the commonly 
reported AEs in the niraparib-treated patients of the NOVA study, including gastrointestinal events 
(nausea and vomiting), fatigue, decreased appetite, and events related to hematologic laboratory 
abnormalities. However, hypertension did not constitute one of the most commonly reported AEs in 
the OCT pool, as this AE was reported in only 3 patients (0.8%) across the studies. 
Treatment Related Adverse Events 
In the NOVA study, 98% (358/367) of the patients who received niraparib and 71% (127/179) who 
received placebo experienced treatment-related AEs. Treatment-related AEs reported in >25% of 
patients in the niraparib arm with corresponding incidence in the placebo arm were nausea (69%;

253/367, and 25%; 45/179), anaemia (46%; 170/367, and 5%; 8/179), thrombocytopenia (45%; 
164/367, and 2%; 4/179), and fatigue (37%; 137/367, and 21%; 37/179). 
Treatment-related AEs reported in ≥10% of the patients in the OCT pool were consistent with the 
incidence of AEs across the studies in general, and included nausea (50%; 190/384), anaemia 
(40%; 153/384), thrombocytopenia (35%; 133/384), fatigue (34%; 132/384), vomiting (29%; 
111/384), decreased appetite (19%; 71/384), neutropenia (16%; 62/384), platelet count 
decreased (15%; 58/384), and constipation (14%; 55/384). 
CTCAE Grade 3/4 AEs 
Table 40: Grade 3/4 Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Reported in ≥5% of Patients in 
Either Treatment Arm (NOVA Main Study, SAF Population, N=546) 
In the NOVA study, 65% (237/367) of the patients treated with niraparib experienced ≥Grade 3 
treatment-related AEs, most commonly thrombocytopenia (28%; 103/367) and anaemia (25%; 
90/367). The overall incidence of treatment-related Grade 3/4 AEs in the placebo arm was low 
(5%; 8 patients); no treatment-related Grade 3/4 AE was reported in more than 2 patients 
receiving placebo. 
The incidence of all Grade ≥3 AEs were markedly decreased following dose reduction to 200 mg, 
except for anaemia and hypertension where the incidences were reduced first at doses of 100 mg 
(Table 39).

Adverse events of special interest 
Myelosuppression Events 
In the NOVA study, patients eligible for niraparib therapy had the following baseline haematologic 
parameters: absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500 cells/µL; platelets ≥ 100,000 cells/µL and 
haemoglobin  ≥ 9 g/dL prior to therapy. Haematologic adverse reactions (thrombocytopenia, 
anaemia, neutropenia) have been reported in patients treated with niraparib.  
Haematologic adverse reactions (thrombocytopenia, anaemia, neutropenia) including clinical 
diagnoses and/or laboratory findings generally occurred early during niraparib treatment with the 
incidence decreasing over time. 
Table 42: Overall Summary of Treatment-emergent Myelosuppression Events by Type of Event 
(NOVA Main Study, SAF Population, N=546) 
Thrombocytopenia Events 
In the NOVA study, reports of AEs relating to thrombocytopenia events (thrombocytopenia and 
platelet count decreased) were high in the niraparib arm (approx. 60% overall (61%); 34% Grade 
3/4) compared to placebo (6%;<1% Grade 3/4). 
The median time to onset of thrombocytopenia regardless of grade was 22 days and 23 days for 
Grade 3/4 events.   Thrombocytopenia occurred more commonly in patients whose baseline 
platelet count was less than 180 × 109/L. Approximately 76 % of patients with lower baseline 
platelets (< 180 × 109/L) who received niraparib experienced thrombocytopenia of any grade, and 
45 % of the patients experienced Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia.  
Niraparib-treated patients with any prior history of thrombocytopenia also had a higher risk of any 
Grade thrombocytopenia (70%; 121/172) compared to those without a prior history (53%; 
104/195). In the NOVA study, 48 of 367 (13 %) of patients experienced bleeding with concurrent 
thrombocytopenia; all bleeding events concurrent with thrombocytopenia were Grade 1 or 2 in 
Assessment report  
EMA/648982/2017 
Page 94/122 
  
  
 
severity, except for one patient who experienced Grade 3 petechiae and hematoma concurrent with 
an SAE of pancytopenia.  
The overall incidence of thrombocytopenia events (thrombocytopenia and platelet count decreased) 
was reported in a slightly lower proportion of patients in the OCT pooled dataset compared to the 
NOVA study (49% vs 61%). However, the incidence of Grade ≥3 events (28% vs 34%) and SAEs 
(8% vs 11%) was almost similar. 
The median times to onset of any Grade and Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia events among patients 
who received niraparib were 22 and 23 days, respectively. The median duration was 23 days, with 
a shorter duration of Grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia events, resolving within approximately 10 days 
following dose interruptions of niraparib. The same median times to onset and median durations 
were observed across the OCT pool. 
The rate of new incidences of thrombocytopenia after intensive dose modifications were performed 
during the first two months of treatment from Cycle 4 was 1.2 %.  
Discontinuation due to thrombocytopenia events (thrombocytopenia and platelet count decreased) 
occurred in approximately 3 % of the patients. 
 The incidence of any Grade of thrombocytopenia in the NOVA study and the OCT pool was highest 
during the first treatment cycle and decreased rapidly thereafter, most probably due to the 
intensive dose modifications (interruptions and/or reductions) performed during the first two cycles 
of treatment. 
Additionally, 20% of the patients treated with niraparib in the NOVA study received 1 to 2 platelet 
transfusions mainly during the first cycle, without need for further transfusions after dose 
modification.  
Anaemia Events 
In the NOVA study, reports of AEs relating to anaemia events (anaemia and haemoglobin 
decreased) were high in the niraparib arm (50%; 25% Grade 3/4) compared to placebo (7%; none 
Grade 3/4). 
The incidence of on-treatment anaemia of any Grade was more common among patients with lower 
baseline haemoglobin concentration (<10 g/dL) with 82% (18/22) developing anaemia compared 
to those patients in the NOVA study with higher baseline levels (≥12 g/dL). Patients with any prior 
history of anaemia also had a somewhat higher risk of any Grade anaemia on study (53%; 
126/236) compared to those without a prior history (44%; 58/131). Among niraparib-treated 
patients, 28% (102/367) received a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. In the niraparib arm, 61 
patients (17%) experienced concurrent AESI of any Grade anaemia with Grade ≥2 fatigue. 
The median time to onset of anaemia of any grade was 42 days, and 85 days for Grade 3/4 events. 
The median duration of anaemia of any grade was 63 days, and 8 days for Grade 3/4 events. 
Anaemia of any grade might persist during Zejula treatment. Discontinuation due to anaemia 
occurred in 1 % of patients. 
The overall incidence of anaemia event in the OCT pool was similar to the NOVA study, 45% 
(173/384) vs 50%; as was the incidence of Grade ≥3 events (21% (81/384) and 25%) and SAEs 
(3% (10/384) and 4%). 
Across the studies in the OCT pool versus the NOVA study, the median time to onset of the first 
anaemia event of any Grade (29 vs 42 days) and Grade 3/4 (57 vs 85 days) were shorter, as was 
the median durations of all-Grade (51 and 63 days). However, the median duration of Grade ≥3 
events were similar in the two safety populations (7 and 8 days, respectively). Moreover, as 
anaemia events) can lead to fatigue, a review was conducted to assess anaemia events that 
Assessment report  
EMA/648982/2017 
Page 95/122 
  
  
occurred concurrent with Grade ≥2 fatigue events in the NOVA study. Overall, 17% of the patients 
in the niraparib arm experienced concurrent (±30 days) AESI of any Grade anaemia with Grade ≥2 
fatigue; no patients in the placebo arm experienced concurrent anaemia and fatigue events. 
Neutropenia Events 
In the NOVA study, reports of AEs relating to neutropenia events (neutropenia, neutrophil count 
decreased, and febrile neutropenia) were high in patients treated with niraparib (30% overall; 20% 
Grade 3/4) compared to patients who received placebo (6%; 2% Grade 3/4). 
The incidence of on-treatment neutropenia was most common among patients with a prior history 
of Grade 4 neutropenia (56%; 20/36) and was also more common among patients with any prior 
history of neutropenia (36%; 75/206) compared to those without a prior history (22%; 36/161). 
Overall, 1% (5/367) of niraparib-treated patients and none of the placebo patients experienced a 
Grade 4 neutropenia event concurrent (±30 days) with an infection. Infections occurring 
concurrently with Grade 4 neutropenia included urinary tract infection (0.5%; 2 patients), and 
bronchitis, clostridial infection, and eye infection (0.3%/1 patient each). 
The median time to onset of neutropenia of any grade was 27 days, and 29 days for Grade 3/4 
events. The median duration of neutropenia of any grade was 26 days, and 13 days for Grade 3/4 
events.  
In the clinical programme, neutropenia was managed with laboratory monitoring and dose 
modifications (see section 4.2). In addition, Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) was 
administered to approximately 6 % of patients treated with niraparib as concomitant therapy for 
neutropenia.  Discontinuation due to neutropenia events occurred in 2 % of patients.The overall 
incidence of neutropenia events was reported in a slightly lower proportion of patients in the OCT 
pooled dataset compared to the NOVA study, 22% (83/384) vs 30%, as was the incidence of Grade 
≥3 events (14% (54/384) vs 20%).  
The median (range) of the total duration of exposure was 163 days in the NOVA study and 57 days 
across the OCT pool. The median times to onset of the first occurrence of any Grade and Grade ≥3 
neutropenia event across the studies in the OCT pool (28 and 29 days, respectively) was similar to 
the NOVA study (27 and 29 days, respectively). The median durations of all Grade and Grade ≥3 
neutropenia events were shorter in the OCT pool (15 and 8 days, respectively) compared to the 
niraparib arm of the NOVA study (26 and 13 days, respectively). 
The overall incidence of neutropenia events in the NOVA study and OCT pool was highest during 
the first treatment cycle and was lower in all other cycles thereafter probably due to intensive dose 
modifications (interruptions and/or reductions) performed during the first two cycles of treatment. 
Leukopenia Events 
Leukopenia events include reports of neutropenia, neutrophil count decrease, white blood cell count 
decreased, leukopenia, lymphocyte count decreased, lymphopenia, febrile neutropenia, and 
monocyte count decreased. In accordance with the occurrence of neutropenia events in the NOVA 
study, reports of AEs related to leukopenia events were high in patients treated with niraparib 
(35%; 22% Grade 3/4) compared to patients who received placebo (12%; 2% Grade 3/4). 
The incidences of both any Grade and Grade 3/4 of leukopenia events seems to mainly be affected 
by the occurrence of neutropenia events. The proportions of patients experiencing SAEs related to 
leukopenia events and withdraw study drug due to leukopenia events is identical to the incidences 
observed for neutropenia events in niraparib-treated patients.

Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS) and Acute Myelogenous Leukaemia (AML) 
The overall incidence of MDS/AML across the clinical development program of niraparib was 0.9% 
(7/751). In the NOVA study, the incidence of MDS/AML in patients who received niraparib (1.4 %) 
was similar to that in patients who received placebo (1.1 %). The duration of niraparib treatment in 
patients prior to developing MDS/AML varied from 1 month to > 2 years. The cases were typical of 
secondary, cancer therapy-related MDS/AML. Of note, the majority of the patients that developed 
MSD/AML was heavily pre-treated (7/9) and had a prior history of myelosuppression (8/9). All 
patients had received multiple platinum-containing chemotherapy regimens and many had also 
received other DNA damaging agents and radiotherapy. Some of the patients had a history of bone 
marrow dysplasia.  
Hypertension 
In the NOVA study, hypertension was reported as a TEAE in 19.3% (71/367) of the patients who 
received niraparib and in 5% (8/179) of the patients who received placebo. Grade 3 hypertension 
was reported in 8.2% (30/367) in the niraparib arm and Grade 3 hypertensive crisis was reported 
in 2 (<1%) compared to 4 patients (2%) in the placebo arm with Grade 3 hypertension. Among 
the patients in the niraparib arm who developed Grade 3 hypertension, 47% (15/32) reported a 
medical history of hypertension. There were no reports of Grade 4 hypertension.  
No patients discontinued treatment due to hypertension in the NOVA study, although hypertension 
led to dose reduction for 5 niraparib-treated patients (1.4%) and none in the placebo arm.  
In the clinical programme, hypertension was readily managed with anti-hypertensive medicinal 
products. Discontinuation due to hypertension occurred in < 1 % of patients. 
Fatigue 
The data from the NOVA study suggest that the incidence is more common for niraparib-treated 
patients (59%; 218/367) compared to patients who received placebo (41%; 74/179). The events 
were reported to be severe in approximately 8% (30/367; Grade 3) of the patients treated with 
niraparib. 
In addition, when accounting for duration of exposure in terms of PEY (patient-exposure years), an 
even higher incidence was reported across the OCT pool compared to the NOVA study (2.77 vs 
0.93 PEY). In the NOVA study, the fatigue events were reported to be severe in approximately 8% 
(Grade 3) of the patients treated with niraparib. 
Gastrointestinal Disorders 
In the NOVA study, AEs of nausea, vomiting, and constipation were experienced at substantially 
higher incidences in the niraparib arm (74%, 34%, and 40%; 3%, 2%, and 0.5% Grade 3/4, 
respectively) compared to the placebo arm (35%, 16%, 20%; 1%, 0.6%, and 0.6% Grade 3/4, 
respectively). Both nausea and vomiting tended to occur early during niraparib treatment with the 
highest incidences observed within the first cycle of treatment. The incidences markedly declined 
after the first month of treatment, most probably due to the intensive dose modifications 
performed during the first two cycles of treatment. The prevalence of nausea or decreased slowly 
and therefore remained relatively sustained throughout the study (>42% and >8%, respectively). 
Accordingly, the most common gastrointestinal AEs within the OCT pool were nausea (60%; Grade 
≥3: 8%) and vomiting (40%; Grade ≥3: 8%). However, when accounting for duration of exposure 
in terms of PEY, an even higher incidence was reported across the OCT studies. Overall, in the 
NOVA study, the incidence rates of nausea and vomiting by PEY were 2.94 and 0.61, respectively, 
and 5.58 and 2.06, respectively, in the OCT pool. Both nausea and vomiting tended to occur early 
during niraparib treatment with the highest incidences observed within the first cycle of treatment,

declining markedly thereafter, most probably because of the intensive dose modifications 
performed during the first two cycles of treatment. 
Other AESIs 
Other AESIs includes pneumonitis, headache, decreased appetite, insomnia, dyspnoea, dizziness, 
cough, palpitations and dysgeusia. 
Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
The relative risk for common AEs and Grade 3/4 AEs in the NOVA study was assessed for patients 
treated with niraparib versus patients treated with placebo to determine the suspected adverse 
drug reactions (ADRs) for inclusion in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC). Given the 
high frequency of treatment-related AEs in both treatment arms per the investigator assessment of 
relationship, relative risk for TEAEs in the niraparib treatment arm versus the placebo arm was 
selected as the primary method to determine ADRs. 
In the pivotal NOVA study, adverse reactions (ADRs) occurring ≥  10 % of patients receiving Zejula 
monotherapy were nausea, thrombocytopenia, fatigue/asthenia, anaemia, constipation, vomiting, 
abdominal pain, neutropenia, insomnia, headache, decreased appetite, nasopharyngitis, diarrhoea, 
dyspnea, hypertension, dyspepsia, back pain, dizziness, cough, urinary tract infection, arthralgia, 
palpitations, and dysgeusia. The most common serious adverse reactions > 1 % (treatment 
emergent frequencies) were thrombocytopenia and anaemia.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events reported in the NOVA study are shown in Table 52. 
Table 44: Serious Adverse Events Reported in ≥1% of Patients in Either Treatment Arm: 
All Patients Cohort (NOVA Main Study, SAF Population, N=546) 
Abbreviations: MedDRA=Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; SAE= serious adverse event; 
SAF=safety. Source: CSR PR-30-5011-C Table 14.3.1.1A and Table 14.3.1.6 
In the OCT pool, treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 39% (150/384) of the patients across 
the studies. The most commonly reported SAEs were thrombocytopenia (7%; 26/384), small 
intestinal obstruction (6%; 24/384), and vomiting (6%; 23/384). 
In the NOVA study, treatment-related SAEs were reported in 17% (62/367) of the patients who 
received niraparib and 1% (2/179) who received placebo. All of the thrombocytopenia and anaemia 
AEs reported as SAEs were assessed as related to study drug. All other related SAEs were reported 
in <1% of niraparib-treated patients. In the OCT pool, treatment-related SAEs were reported in 
18% (68/384) of the patients, most commonly thrombocytopenia (7%; 26/384), vomiting (4%; 
14/384), anaemia (3%; 10/384), nausea (2%; 7/384), and neutropenia (2%; 6/384). 
Deaths 
No on-treatment deaths were reported in the NOVA study. Nevertheless, 95 deaths were reported 
during the follow-up period, including 16% (60/372) randomized to niraparib and 19% (35/181) of 
the patients randomized to placebo.  
Three deaths were reported during the post-treatment follow-up period due to MDS/AML, including 
1 patient who received niraparib and 2 who received placebo. 
Across all 384 patients in the OCT pool, 5 (1%) experienced AEs that were fatal; 4 of the 5 events 
occurred during QUADRA and 1 occurred in the FE sub-study. Two of the deaths, including 
gastrointestinal haemorrhage and acute respiratory failure, both in QUADRA, were assessed as 
treatment related. The deaths in the other 3 patients were assessed as unrelated to study 
treatment and included sepsis and hyperbilirubinemia in QUADRA and disease progression in the FE 
sub-study.

Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Details on changes from baseline in platelet count, haemoglobin concentrations, neutrophil counts, 
and leukocyte counts observed in the NOVA study and OCT pool can be found in the section 
‘Adverse events of special interest’.  
No meaningful changes or shifts from baseline were observed for other haematology parameters 
during the NOVA study. 
Creatinine increase 
In the NOVA study, reports of raised creatinine levels from baseline was higher in the niraparib arm 
(37%; 136/367) compared to the placebo arm (15%; 26/179). However, the majority of the 
reports were Grade 1 or 2 in severity, and only two patients in each treatment arm reported a shift 
to Grade ≥3 in creatinine levels. Of note, a dose-dependent reduction in the frequency of raised 
creatinine levels was observed in the NOVA study: 4.9% (18/367) at 300 mg, 2.4% (6/254) at 200 
mg, and 0.8% (1/128) at 100 mg dose of niraparib. 
Gamma-Glutamyltransferase GGT 
Twice as many patients in the niraparib arm compared to the placebo arm (4% vs 2%), reported 
Grade 3/4 increases in GGT. In addition, 6 possible cases of Hy’s law were reported in patients with 
ovarian cancer during the clinical development program of niraparib (in the NOVA study and the 
OCT pool). All cases was attributed to concurrent elevations in alkaline phosphatase to >2-6×ULN 
due to hepatic cholestasis. None of the cases was considered related to study treatment. 
QTc prolongation 
The low number of cases of QTc prolongation in the NOVA study precludes any firm conclusion on 
the association with niraparib treatment. However based on PK data, niraparib is not expected to 
have a significant effect on QTc. 
Safety in special populations 
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
There are no data regarding the use of niraparib in pregnant and lactating women, as both 
pregnancy and breast feeding were exclusion criteria in the clinical studies. Moreover, animal 
studies have not been conducted. Still, based on the mode of action of niraparib, embryo-foetal 
toxicity is possible. Niraparib should not be used during pregnancy or in women of childbearing 
potential not using reliable contraception during therapy and for 1 month after receiving the last 
dose. Women of childbearing potential should not become pregnant while on niraparib. A 
pregnancy test should be performed on all women of childbearing potential prior to treatment. It is 
unknown whether niraparib or its metabolites are excreted in human milk (see sections 4.3, 4.4, 
4.6 of the SmPC).  
Age 
In the NOVA study, 65% (n=355) of the patients were <65 years in age, whereas 29.3% (n=160) 
were 65-74 years old, and 5.7% (n=31) were 74-84 years old. No patients over the age of 84 were 
included in the main study.

In summary, the data from the NOVA study demonstrates trends toward more AEs in patients 
above 65 years. While there does not appear to be much differences in the frequency of AEs 
between patients in the age groups 65-74 and 75-84 years, the observed differences may be owing 
to a very low number of patients in the 75-84 age cohort. 
The AEs reported to occur more frequently in patients ≥65 vs <65 years were dizziness (21.7% 
versus 13.9%, respectively), paresthesias (7.8% versus 2.9%), peripheral sensory neuropathy 
(5.4% versus 2.1%) and sciatica (4.7% versus 1.3%). In addition, there were minimal (≤5%) to 
(≤10%) modest increases in the older versus youngest population for AEs of the following SOCs: 
psychiatric, accident and injuries, cardiac, and anti-cholinergic syndrome. 
The overall frequency of AEs reported was similar between the age groups of patients between 64-
74 and 75-84 years, but for nervous system AEs the frequency was higher for the older patient 
group (65.2% vs 59.4%) and the opposite was observed for the sum of hypotension, falls, black 
outs, syncope, dizziness, ataxia and fractures (27.4% vs. 21.7%). Both of these categories of AEs 
were reported with a lower frequency in the younger patient population < 65 years, with an 
incidence of 50.4% and 16.4% respectively.

Race 
The majority of the patients included in the NOVA study and OCT pool were Caucasian (86%) and 
exposure in non-Caucasian patients is limited.  
Weight 
Approximately 25 % of patients in the NOVA study weighed less than 58 kg, and approximately 
25 % of patients weighed more than 77 kg. The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 ADRs was greater 
among low body weight patients (78 %) than high body weight patients (53 %). Only 13 % of low 
body weight patients (< 58 kg) remained at a dose of 300 mg beyond Cycle 3 compared to 37% 
for patients ≥77 kg. 
Hepatic and renal impairment   
No studies in patients with severe hepatic or renal impairment using niraparib have been 
performed. 
Immunological events 
No specific immunological events associated with niraparib has been reported by the Applicant. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific in vivo drug-drug interaction studies have been performed, which raises the concern 
that niraparib potentially could cause serious drug-drug interactions in a clinical setting. Please 
refer to the subsection 3.4.1 Pharmacokinetics of this AR for more information. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
AEs resulting in withdrawal of study drug in the NOVA study were reported in 15% (54/367) who 
received niraparib and in 2% (4/179) of the patients who received placebo (Table 54).

Patients (NOVA Main Study, SAF Population, N=546) 
Abbreviations: MedDRA=Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities; SAF=safety; TEAE=treatment-emergent adverse event.  
In the OCT pool, 18% (68/384) of the patients withdrew from niraparib treatment due to AEs. The 
most common reasons for withdrawal due to AEs in the OCT pool were vomiting (3.1%; 12/384), 
small intestinal obstruction (2.6%; 10/384), thrombocytopenia (2.6%; 10/384), and nausea 
(2.3%; 9/384); all other events leading to withdrawal were reported in ≤1% of the patients.

Dose interruptions and dose reductions 
In the NOVA study, at least 1 study drug interruption was instituted for 244 patients (67%) who 
received niraparib and for 26 patients (15%) who received placebo. Per protocol, dose 
interruptions in the NOVA study were required for any patient with platelet count <100×109/L, 
neutrophil count <1.0×109/L, haemoglobin <8 g/dL, or any Grade 3/4 treatment-related non-
hematologic toxicity.  
Consistent with these dose modification requirements, the most common AEs leading to 
interruption of niraparib dosing were thrombocytopenia (30.8%; 113/367), anaemia (19.6%; 
72/367), and neutropenia (10.1%; 37/367). These events were uncommonly reported as leading 
to treatment interruption in the placebo arm, with incidences of respectively 0.6%, 0 and 1.1%. 
Platelet count decrease (9.0%; 33/367), nausea (7.4%; 27/367), vomiting (6.0%; 22/367), 
neutrophil count decrease (5.2%; 19/367) and fatigue (4.6%; 17/367) all led to dose interruption 
in ≥4% of the patients in the niraparib arm. The incidences of these AEs in the placebo arm were 
considerably lower, specifically 0, 2.2%, 2.2%, 0 and 1.1%, respectively. Notably, hypertension led 
to treatment interruption for 5 (1.4%) patients in the niraparib arm and 1 (0.6%) patient in the 
placebo arm.  
In the OCT pool, study drug interruption was instituted for 63% (242/384) of the patients across 
the studies. Consistent with the results of the NOVA study, the most commonly reported events 
leading to dose interruption were haematology laboratory abnormalities and gastrointestinal 
disturbances, including thrombocytopenia (26%; 98/384), anaemia (13%; 49/384), platelet count 
decreased (11%; 41/384), nausea (9%; 35/384), vomiting (8%; 32/384), and neutropenia (7%; 
26/384).  
Figure 24 displays the percent of patients in the overall niraparib arm of the NOVA study with dose 
interruptions and dose reductions reported due to AEs over time on treatment. As shown, 
interruptions were instituted early in treatment (Month 1) with reductions employed primarily in 
Month 2; decreases in the incidence of these dose modifications were observed thereafter. 
In the NOVA study, at least 1 dose reduction was instituted for AEs in 253 patients (69%) who 
received niraparib and in 9 patients (5%) who received placebo. 48 % of patients had a dose 
interruption in Cycle 1. Approximately 47 % of patients restarted at a reduced dose in Cycle 2. The 
most commonly used dose in niraparib treated patients in the NOVA study was 200 mg.

Figure 24 Niraparib Dose Interruptions and Reductions Over Time in the NOVA study (SAF 
Population, N=367) 
The overall incidence of dose reduction reported in the OCT pool (28%; 107/384) was much lower 
than the incidence reported in the NOVA study. This is related to changes to the required dose 
modification criteria implemented in the QUADRA study which no longer mandated dose reductions 
for patients with platelet counts <100,000/μL; dose reductions were required for patients with 
platelet counts <75,000/μL and at the second occurrence of counts <100,000/μL.

Dose reductions in the NOVA study tended to occur early with most patients reaching their 
individual adjusted dose level by the start of Month 4 (i.e., Cycle 4) of treatment. Overall, dose 
interruptions for any reason were instituted for 80% of patients on niraparib; 73% underwent a 
dose reduction. The rates were lower for placebo with 19% having the dose interrupted and 6% 
having a dose reduction.

Discontinuations due to adverse events 
Fatigue (2.7%), nausea (1.6%) and myelosuppression in terms of thrombocytopenia (1.9%), 
anaemia (1.4%), platelet- (1.4%) and neutrophil count decrease (1.1%) were the most common 
AEs leading to treatment discontinuation from the niraparib arm of the NOVA study. None of the 
patients in the placebo arm discontinued treatment due to these AEs, with the exception of one 
patient who discontinued due to thrombocytopenia.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The clinical safety programme includes an evaluation of safety across a total of 854 patients who 
received at least 1 dose of niraparib administered as a monotherapy dose of 3x100 mg (capsules). 
This includes 367 patients in the placebo-controlled NOVA study, which were exposed to at least 
one dose of 300 mg niraparib, and 245 subjects (66.8%) and 163 subjects (44.4%) who were 
treated for ≥6 to <12 months and ≥12 months, respectively, with 100-300 mg/day niraparib at 
the data cut-off date. However, the mean relative dose intensity of approximately 65% (195 
mg/day) of the scheduled dose in the niraparib arm of the NOVA study is considered rather low 
compared to the placebo group (97%; 290 mg/day). The intensive dose modifications performed 
(>70%) in the niraparib arm of the NOVA study were consistent with a picture of severe AEs 
experienced by these patients, which questions the selected start dose of 300 mg/day with respect 
to patient’s tolerability. 
A lower starting dose (e.g. 200 mg/day) would require further clinical investigation in the context 
of a new phase III study. It is not clear whether the observed efficacy, particularly in patients 
without BRCA mutation, would have been experienced with a lower starting dose. It is 
acknowledged that tolerability to niraparib treatment was acceptable once a dose was modified to a 
Assessment report

patient’s individual profile, primarily within the first three cycles of treatment, and most patients 
remained on treatment long enough to experience continuing benefit from niraparib.  
In spite of the convincing efficacy results, less than 30% of the patients continued on the starting 
dose of 300 mg during the NOVA study. In addition, most dose reductions occurred within the first 
60 days of the study, reflecting excess exposure of niraparib in most of the patients that might be 
due to the chosen starting dose. Some of the AEs (e.g. anaemia, fatigue, nausea and vomiting) 
also persisted after dose reductions were performed, which further reinforces that dose reduction 
may not be the optimal strategy to manage toxicity. Importantly, niraparib will be used as a 
maintenance treatment of patients with ovarian cancer who are in complete or partial response to 
prior treatment when niraparib is initiated, hence tolerability of the medicine is quite crucial.  
The applicant informs that they are currently testing an approach where niraparib is initiated at a 
lower starting dose of 200 mg daily in combination with pembrolizumab in the ongoing TOPACIO 
study in patients with ovarian or triple negative breast cancer. The initial dose may then be 
increased in a subset of patients without evidence of thrombocytopenia as this AE is the main acute 
concern with niraparib use in the NOVA study. However, other haematological laboratory 
abnormalities and treatment-related AEs observed in the first cycles of treatment with niraparib, 
such as fatigue, anemia and neutropenia, also constitute safety concerns related to the 
recommended starting dose of niraparib in the sought indication.  
The most common AEs in the NOVA study were related to myelosuppression and gastrointestinal 
events. There were marked differences observed between the niraparib and placebo arm in the 
incidence of thrombocytopenia events (61%; Grade 3/4: 34%), anaemia events (50%; Grade 3/4: 
25%), and nausea (74%; Grade 3/4: 3%). Other AEs commonly reported in the niraparib arm with 
higher incidences than the placebo arm were: constipation (40%), vomiting (34%; Grade 3/4: 
2%), insomnia (24%), headache (26%), hypertension (19%; Grade 3: 8%), neutropenia events 
(30%; Grade 3/4: 20%), fatigue events (59%; Grade 3: 8%), dyspnoea (19%), decreased 
appetite (25%), and cough (15%). The most frequently reported AEs overall in the OCT pool were 
consistent with the commonly reported AEs in the niraparib-treated patients of the NOVA study, 
including gastrointestinal events (nausea and vomiting), fatigue, decreased appetite, and events 
related to hematologic laboratory abnormalities. However, hypertension did not constitute one of 
the most commonly reported AEs in the OCT pool, as this AE was reported in only 3 patients 
(0.8%) across the studies. The pattern of AEs is similar to that observed for olaparib, a PARP 
inhibitor approved in EU for platinum-sensitive recurrent BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer, except 
that thrombocytopenia and constipation are reported more commonly and that hypertension 
constitutes a new safety signal for niraparib. 
In the NOVA study, a significantly higher rate of treatment-related SAEs was reported in niraparib-
treated patients compared to patients who received placebo, 17% vs 1%. The treatment-related 
SAEs with the highest incidence, which also were increased for niraparib compared to placebo, 
were thrombocytopenia (10.9% vs 0) and anaemia (3.8% vs 0). Too few events for the other SAEs 
were reported in order to draw any conclusion on whether there is a real difference between the 
two treatment arms. The types and incidence of commonly reported SAEs in the OCT pool, 
primarily haematology laboratory abnormalities and gastrointestinal disturbances, were similar to 
the SAEs reported in the NOVA study. The proportion of patients reporting treatment-related SAEs 
was similar between patients treated with niraparib in the NOVA study and OCT pool (17% and 
18%, respectively). 
The safety profile of niraparib in terms of thrombocytopenia events were poor and seems to be 
related to the recommended daily dose of 300 mg. Patients treated with niraparib might have an 
increased risk of haemorrhage, especially in the setting of concurrent thrombocytopenia. In the 
clinical programme, thrombocytopenia was managed with laboratory monitoring, dose modification 
and platelet transfusion where appropriate (see SmPC, section 4.2). 
Assessment report  
EMA/648982/2017 
Page 107/122 
  
  
Due to the risk of thrombocytopenia, anticoagulants and medicinal products known to reduce the 
thrombocyte count should be used with caution (see sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
In accordance with the incidences of thrombocytopenia events, reports of AEs relating to anaemia 
events (anaemia and haemoglobin decreased) were high among niraparib-treated patients in the 
NOVA study (50%; Grade 3/4: 25%). In the clinical programme, anaemia was also managed with 
laboratory monitoring, dose modification (see section 4.2), and where appropriate with red blood 
cell transfusions. 
Although markedly lower than for thrombocytopenia and anaemia events, the incidences of 
neutropenia events (neutropenia, neutrophil count decreased, and febrile neutropenia) in the NOVA 
study were rather high among niraparib-treated patients (30%; Grade 3/4: 20%). In the clinical 
programme, neutropenia was managed with laboratory monitoring and dose modifications (see 
section 4.2). In addition, Granulocyte-Colony Stimulating Factor (G-CSF) was administered to 
approximately 6 % of patients treated with niraparib as concomitant therapy for neutropenia. 
Pancytopenia has been observed in < 1 % of patients receiving niraparib. If a patient develops 
severe persistent haematologic toxicity including pancytopenia that does not resolve within 28 days 
following interruption, Zejula should be discontinued. 
Testing complete blood counts (CBC) weekly for the first month of treatment and the dose should 
be modified as needed. After the first month, it is recommended to monitor CBC monthly for the 
next 10 months of treatment and periodically after this time is recommended to monitor for 
clinically significant changes in any haematologic parameter during treatment (see section 4.2). 
The incidence of MDS/AML in the niraparib arm of the NOVA study was slightly higher than the 
placebo arm (1.4% vs 1.1%). MDS diagnosis and progression may take years to develop after 
treatment initiation. Thus, due to the relatively short duration of exposure to niraparib and the 
short follow-up within the NOVA study, it cannot be excluded that development of MDS/AML is 
related to niraparib. If MDS and/or AML are confirmed while on treatment with niraparib, treatment 
should be discontinued and the patient treated appropriately. 
The increased risk of MDS/AML with niraparib maintenance treatment is not well defined and the 
level of this risk should be better characterized, particularly in view of the duration of the exposure. 
The potential risk of MDS/AML will be further monitored as an Adverse Event of Special Interest in 
all clinical trials and in all post-marketing activities. The applicant will perform a PASS to further 
investigate the extent to which niraparib may contribute to the risk of MDS/AML. The applicant will 
submit a synopsis outlining the details of the planned analyses within 3 months of marketing 
approval (see RMP).  
Hypertension, including hypertensive crisis, has been reported with the use of Zejula. Pre-existing 
hypertension should be adequately controlled before starting Zejula treatment. Blood pressure 
should be monitored monthly for the first year and periodically thereafter during treatment with 
niraparib. 
Hypertension should be medically managed with antihypertensive medicinal products as well as 
adjustment of the Zejula dose (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC), if necessary. In the clinical 
programme, blood pressure measurements were obtained on Day 1 of each 28-day cycle while the 
patient remained on Zejula. In most cases, hypertension was controlled adequately using standard 
antihypertensive treatment with or without Zejula dose adjustment. Niraparib should be 
discontinued in case of hypertensive crisis or if medically significant hypertension cannot be 
adequately controlled with antihypertensive therapy (see sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Although occurrence of fatigue events (include fatigue, asthenia, malaise and lethargy) are 
symptoms associated with ovarian cancer, the data from the NOVA study suggest that the 
incidence is more common for niraparib-treated patients compared to patients who received 
Assessment report  
EMA/648982/2017 
Page 108/122 
  
  
placebo (59% vs 41%). Twice as many patients in the niraparib arm compared to the placebo arm 
(4% vs 2%), reported Grade 3/4 increases in GGT. In addition, 6 possible cases of Hy’s law were 
reported in patients with ovarian cancer during the clinical development program of niraparib (in 
the NOVA study and the OCT pool). No clear causal association was shown in the worsening of 
hepatic injury. In consequence, there is insufficient evidence of a risk of severe hepatic toxicity 
with niraparib use to warrant specific SmPC guidance. 
The majority of the patients included in the NOVA study and OCT pool were Caucasian (86%) and 
exposure in non-Caucasian patient is thus limited. Accordingly, an assessment of safety by race is 
difficult. However, in the population pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modelling report, no 
significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of niraparib related to race and ethnicity was observed. 
Moreover, although based on limited number of non-Caucasians, there were no clinically significant 
differences in the incidences of Grade 3/4 AEs based on race and ethnicity. From the information 
provided, it is therefore not anticipated that the safety profile will be significantly different in 
patients of different racial and/or ethnic origin. The lack of robust data on niraparib in non-
Caucasian patients is reflected in the proposed SmPC. 
In general, there were no clinically significant differences observed in the frequency of AEs between 
different age groups. However, data from the NOVA study demonstrates trends toward more AEs in 
patients ≥ 65 years old. Since the oldest age group of patients between 75-84 years is a small 
patient cohort (n=31), no conclusions can be drawn regarding the differences in the frequencies of 
AEs observed between the different age groups and a general warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC 
cannot be supported. 
Only 13 % of low body weight patients remained at a dose of 300 mg beyond Cycle 3. A starting 
dose of 200 mg for patients weighing less than 58 kg may be considered (see section 4.2 of the 
SmPC). 
There are no clinical data on fertility with niraparib .Breast feeding is contraindicated during 
administration of niraparib and for 1 month after receiving the last dose (see sections 4.3 and 4.6 
of the SmPC). 
The incidences of dose interruptions (63% vs 67%) and discontinuations (18% vs 15%) due to AEs 
in the OCT pool was similar to the incidence observed among niraparib-treated patients in the 
NOVA study; however, the incidence of dose reductions was markedly lower in the OCT pool (28% 
vs 69%). The applicant suggested that the lower dose reduction rate in the OCT pool might be 
related to changes implemented in the QUADRA study protocol that did not require mandatory dose 
reductions for platelet counts <100,000/μL, which seems plausible. 
Although a trend towards higher incidences of haematological AEs in the gBRCAmut cohort 
compared to the non-gBRCAmut cohort was seen, analysis of various baseline characteristics did 
not reveal any clear predictors for patient subgroups that clearly required dose reductions or 
initiation of treatment at a lower starting dose. 
There is no specific treatment in the event of Zejula overdose, and symptoms of overdose are not 
established. In the event of an overdose, physicians should follow general supportive measures and 
should treat symptomatically (see SmPC section 4.9). 
Zejula has moderate influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Patients who take Zejula 
may experience asthenia, fatigue and dizziness. Patients who experience these symptoms should 
observe caution when driving or using machines (see SmPC section 4.7). 
Zejula hard capsules contain lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of 
galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase deficiency or glucose galactose malabsorption should not 
take this medicine.

Zejula contains tartrazine (E 102), which may cause allergic reactions. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in 
the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Thrombocytopenia, anaemia, neutropenia, fatigue and nausea/vomiting are the major factors 
limiting the patient’s tolerability to niraparib and the main reasons for one or more dose 
reductions. Although most of the AEs with niraparib can be handled by dose 
interruptions/reductions, some AEs persisted after intensive dose modifications were performed 
(e.g. anaemia, fatigue, nausea and vomiting). Thus, the optimal dosing of niraparib is still 
questioned. However, the daily dose of 300 mg niraparib should be the recommended starting dose 
until new relevant data are available. Accordingly, the applicant is encouraged to look into 
alternative dosing strategies in upcoming clinical trials with niraparib and to study PK parameters 
to obtain information about the plasma concentration-response relationship at different dose levels 
of niraparib. 
The Applicant is recommended to submit updated safety data from the NOVA study when available.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.4, dated 11 September 
2017 is acceptable.  
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant 
fulfils the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are 
set out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the 
PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 27.03.2017. The new EURD list entry 
will therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.8.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of niraparib with active substances contained in authorised 
medicinal products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, 
mixture of isomers, complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers niraparib to be a new active substance as it is 
not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by 
the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the 
Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Zejula (niraparib) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
Assessment report  
EMA/648982/2017 
Page 113/122 
  
  
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification 
of new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The proposed indication for Zejula is “Monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients 
with platinum-sensitive relapsed high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer who are in response (complete or partial) to platinum-based chemotherapy.” 
Platinum sensitivity was defined by complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) for more than 
six months to their penultimate (next to last) platinum-based therapy. To be eligible for niraparib 
treatment the patient should be in response (CR or PR) following completion of last platinum based 
chemotherapy. 
Deficiency in the homologous recombinant DNA repair pathway (HRD) including mutations in the 
BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes is expected to enhance sensitivity to PARP inhibition (niraparib).  This 
defect is referred to as ‘synthetic lethality’; and is somehow or in part linked to platinum 
sensitivity. In addition, there might be other, undefined genome defects (BRCA epigenetic 
modifications, other mutations) that could account for the sensitivity to platinum treatment, 
sometimes referred to as ‘BRCAness’ or ‘HRD deficiencies’. In total, information on deficiency in 
these genes could potentially maximize on the output of the treatment. 
The primary objective of the treatment is to prolong progression-free survival (PFS). Extending the 
time to progression and hence the next chemotherapy regimen without compromising the patient’s 
QoL, can be considered of clinical relevance also without an improvement in OS. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Standard drug treatment for advanced-stage ovarian cancer in the first-line setting is platinum 
(cisplatin or carboplatin) plus a taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel) with or without bevacizumab. 
Initial chemotherapy response rate is high in the platinum sensitive population, but most patients 
with advanced disease will recur within 2 years.  
The claimed indication of niraparib is maintenance treatment in the chemotherapy free interval in 
order to prolong disease control and delay progression. Treatment options today of patients with 
prior platinum-sensitive, recurrent ovarian cancer in the chemotherapy free interval are as per 
NCCN and ESMO guidelines

surveillance; monitor until disease progression while managing the patient’s symptoms but 
not provide active anti-cancer treatment  
bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy followed by bevacizumab monotherapy 
olaparib maintenance treatment following response to platinum-based chemotherapy in 
patients with BRCA mutation 
Despite these treatment options, relapsed disease remains inevitable. Also, repeated platinum-
based chemotherapy can cause cumulative toxicities, serious side effects and patients also report a 
significant burden on quality of life (QOL), as well as hospital fatigue. Effective maintenance 
Assessment report  
EMA/648982/2017 
Page 114/122 
  
  
treatment options for patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian cancer remain limited, and 
represent as such an unmet medical need. In particular, there is a medical need for patients that 
are negative in BRCA mutation, since the current olaparib indication as maintenance treatment is 
only approved for the BRCA mutated population.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
A single pivotal phase III study (NOVA; PR-30-5011-C) is submitted to support the efficacy in the 
claimed indication. NOVA is a double-blind, 2:1 randomized, placebo-controlled, multicentre, global 
clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of niraparib as maintenance treatment for 
patients with platinum-sensitive, recurrent, ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer 
who had received at least 2 platinum-based regimens and were in response (CR or PR) to their last 
platinum-based chemotherapy. The patient population is assigned to two cohorts (germline BRCA 
cohort and non-germline BRCA cohort) using an established and validated blood test to define the 
BRCA mutation status.  
The applicant has performed separate analysis in the two cohorts/groups of the ITT population: 
those with germline BRCA mutation (gBRCAmut cohort) (N=203) and those who were not germline 
BRCA mutation carriers (non-gBRCAmut cohort) (N=350). However, despite allocation to and 
analyses in different subgroups, the proposed indication includes the whole platinum sensitive 
population. 
The primary data to support the safety of treatment with niraparib in the proposed indication are 
derived from the NOVA main study including 546 ovarian cancer patients receiving at least one 
dose of study treatment, out of which 367 received niraparib and 179 received placebo. Key 
supportive safety information is available from 384 ovarian cancer patients treated in 4 open-label, 
single-arm studies or sub-studies: the Phase 1 Study PN001 (N=104 patients total, 50 with ovarian 
cancer), the Phase 2 QUADRA study (N=291 patients), and the 2 sub-studies of NOVA, PR-30-
5011-C1-QTC (N=26 patients) and PR-30-5011-C2-FE (N=17 patients); data from these studies 
have been pooled for analysis. This single pool of studies provides an evaluation of the safety of 
niraparib in women receiving treatment for recurrent ovarian cancer and is designated as the 
Ovarian Cancer Treatment (OCT) pool. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
gBRCAmut cohort 
The primary endpoint PFS was met in this cohort with a HR of 0.27 (95% CI: 0.173 to 0.410, 
p<0.0001) in favour of the niraparib arm. The median PFS was 21 (95% CI: 12.9, NE) months for 
the niraparib arm versus 5.5 (95% CI: 3.8, 7.2) months in the placebo arm. This represents a 
prolongation in PFS of 15.5 months.  
For the patient related outcome, both baseline symptoms and QOL (FOSI and EQ-5D-5L) were 
similar between placebo and niraparib patients in the gBRCAmut cohort with no statistical 
significant difference between the two arms. 
The superiority of the niraparib arm over the placebo arm was observed in all predefined subgroups 
(HR<0.45) and the highest efficacy was observed for the BRCA2 mutation with a HR of 0.12 (95% 
CI: 0.016, 0.332). 
HRDpos/non-gBRCAmut cohort 
The NOVA study met its primary endpoint for the HRDpos group of the non-gBRCAmut cohort with 
a HR of 0.38 (95% CI: 0.243 to 0.586, p<0.001). The median PFS was 12.9 (95% CI: 8.1, 15.9) 
Assessment report  
EMA/648982/2017 
Page 115/122 
  
  
months for the niraparib arm versus 3.8 (95% CI: 3.5, 5.7) months in the placebo arm. This 
represents a prolongation in PFS of 9.1 months. 
Overall/non-gBRCAmut cohort 
The primary endpoint was also met in the overall non-gBRCAmut cohort with a HR of 0.45 (95% 
CI: 0.338 to 0.607) (p<0.0001). The median PFS was 9.3 (95% CI: 7.2, 11.2) months for the 
niraparib arm versus 3.9 (95% CI: 3.7, 5.5) months in the placebo arm. This represents a 
prolongation in PFS of 5.4 months. 
For the sensitivity analysis data are consistent in the various analysis groups of both HRDpos and 
overall, with similar HR values as reported for the primary endpoint.  
Baseline symptoms and QOL (FOSI and EQ-5D-5L) were equivalent between placebo and niraparib 
patients in the non-gBRCAmut cohort. 
The superiority of the niraparib arm over the placebo arm was observed in all predefined subgroups 
of the non-gBRCAmut cohort. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There is some uncertainty about the precise size of the PFS effect for niraparib in the germline 
BRCA cohort, due to conflicting data between the primary (IRC-based) analysis with HR=0.27 
(95% CI: 0.173, 0.410) and sensitivity analyses which showed a HR= 0.35 (0.243, 0.496) when 
applying IRC limited censoring (considering start of subsequent anti-cancer treatment, 
discontinuation due to any reason, or missed tumour assessments as events), and investigator 
assessment of PFS with HR=0.27 (0.182, 0.401).  Similarly, there is some uncertainty about the 
precise size of the PFS effect for niraparib in the non-germline BRCA cohort due to conflicting data 
between the primary (IRC-based) analysis with HR=0.45 (0.338, 0.607) vs HR=0.53 (95 % CI, 
0.405, 0.683) as adjudicated by the investigator. However, the differences are small and overall 
there are no concerns about the statistical significance or the consistency of the effect, and the 
issue has not been pursued further. Results based on investigator assessed PFS have been 
reflected in the SmPC to acknowledge this uncertainty (section 5.1). 
Over 50% of the data for patients in both treatment arms in both cohorts were censored for PFS2 
and median OS was not reached for the ITT population in either randomized treatment arm. 
Updated PFS2 and OS data will be provided (see letter of Recommendation).  
In an exploratory analysis the median PFS in the niraparib arm of the HRDneg group (N=134) was 
6.9 months (95% CI: 5.6, 9.6) compared to 3.8 months (95% CI: 3.7, 5.6) in the placebo arm 
with a HR of 0.58 (95% CI: 0.361, 0.922) (p=0.0226). Based on the underlying molecular 
mechanism this group is not expected to respond to PARP inhibition. Whether this positive 
response of 3.1 months prolongation is, among other hypothesis, due to HRD positive patients 
being incorrectly allocated to the HRDneg group (false negative) by the HRD test has not been 
possible to assess based on current methods and knowledge. Still, the effect was overall 
qualitatively consistent so that this did not warrant a restriction in the indication and testing for 
HRD negativity is not recommended based on the available data. Results in this subpopulation have 
been adequately described in section 5.1 of the SmPC to acknowledge uncertainties about the 
magnitude of the effect in this subpopulation. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most common AEs in the NOVA study were related to myelosuppression and gastrointestinal 
events. These were reported more commonly for niraparib compared to placebo: thrombocytopenia

events (61%; Grade 3/4: 34%), anaemia events (50%; Grade 3/4: 25%), and nausea (74%; 
Grade 3/4: 3%) (see effects table below for incidence rates). 
Other notable AEs reported more commonly for niraparib than placebo were constipation (40%), 
vomiting (34%; Grade 3/4: 2%), insomnia (24%), headache (26%), hypertension (19%; Grade 3: 
8%), neutropenia events (30%; 20% Grade 3/4), fatigue events (59%; Grade 3: 8%), dyspnoea 
(19%), decreased appetite (25%), and cough (15%). The most frequently reported AEs overall in 
the OCT pool were consistent with the commonly reported AEs in the niraparib-treated patients of 
the NOVA study, including gastrointestinal events (nausea and vomiting), fatigue, decreased 
appetite, and events related to hematologic laboratory abnormalities. 
The incidences of most of the treatment-related AEs, including thrombocytopenia-, anaemia-, and 
neutropenia events, nausea and vomiting, were highest during the first month of treatment. The 
incidences were, however, markedly reduced after intensive dose modifications were performed 
during the first two cycles of treatment, from cycle 4 through the remainder of treatment. 
Reported SAEs in the NOVA study were predominantly thrombocytopenia (10.9%) and anaemia 
(3.8%). Consistently, commonly reported SAEs across the OCT studies were primarily haematology 
laboratory abnormalities and gastrointestinal disturbances. The proportion of patients reporting 
treatment-related SAEs was similar between patients treated with niraparib in the NOVA study and 
OCT pool (17% and 18%, respectively). 
The incidence of fatal AEs was low in both the NOVA study and OCT pool. Three deaths were 
reported during the post-treatment follow-up period in the NOVA study due to MDS/AML. In the 
OCT pool, two of the 5 patients with fatal AEs were causally related to niraparib according to the 
investigator. 
Overall, 9 cases of MDS/AML were observed among patients in the NOVA study and OCT pool. The 
incidence of MDS/AML was marginally higher in niraparib-treated patients, 1.4% vs 1.1% in the 
placebo group. In addition, two cases were identified in the FE and QTc sub-studies of the OCT 
pool. Thus, the overall incidence of MDS/AML across the clinical development program of niraparib 
was 0.9%, similar to that reported for another PARP inhibitor, olaparib. 
A causal relationship was found between lower baseline body weight and increased incidences of ≥ 
Grade 3 AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to dose modification or treatment discontinuation, which 
occurred more commonly in patients with a baseline weight <58 kg compared to patients ≥77 kg. 
Approximately 80% of the patients with a body weight of less than 58 kg had a dose reduction 
compared to 59% of the patients with a weight greater than or equal to 77 kg. A 200 mg dose may 
be considered as an alternative starting dose for patients with a body weight less than 58 kg (see 
SmPC section 4.2). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The mean dose of niraparib administered in the NOVA study was approximately 195 mg/day, 
corresponding to a dose that is 105 mg lower than the proposed dose of 300 mg once daily. The 
intensive dose modifications performed (>70%) in the niraparib arm of the NOVA study were 
consistent with the severe AEs experienced by these patients, which questions the selected dose of 
300 mg/day with respect to patient’s tolerability. Moreover, the majority of the interruptions 
occurred during the first month after treatment initiation, while dose reductions occurred primarily 
during the second month.  
PARP-inhibitors could potentially predispose patients to development of MDS/AML, based on 
genotoxicity results and mode of action. Therefore, as MDS diagnosis and progression may take 
years to develop after treatment initiation and the incidence in the niraparib arm of the NOVA 
Assessment report

Page 117/122 
  
  
study was slightly higher than the placebo arm (1.4% vs 1.1%), it cannot be ruled out that 
development of MDS/AML are related to niraparib. Due to the lack of long-term follow-up, the long-
term safety concerning increased risk of MDS/AML with niraparib maintenance treatment is not well 
defined. The level of this risk will be better characterized in a post authorisation safety study, 
particularly in view of the duration of the exposure (see RMP).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The main clinical objective of the study is to show that niraparib can delay cancer progression after 
a chemotherapy regimen in a population of patients that are platinum sensitive. The use of PFS as 
primary endpoint for maintenance therapy in ovarian cancer is supported when there is no 
detrimental effect on OS. This has also been agreed upon with CHMP in scientific advice and is in 
line with the guideline on the evaluation of anticancer medical product in man 
(EMA/CHMP/205/95/Rev. 4) stating that PFS is a valid surrogate endpoint for OS.  For the germline 
cohort the reported gain in PFS from the primary IRC analysis was 15.5 months, which is a 
clinically relevant effect. The PFS data are supported by several sensitivity analyses all showing 
PFS benefit when compared to placebo. The QoL results did not show any detrimental effect of 
niraparib compared to placebo throughout the study period.  
A positive PFS effect is seen also for the non-gBRCAmut cohort, both in the HRDpos population 
(including somatic BRCA mutations and BRCA wild type patients) and the cohort overall, which 
includes the HRDneg population. The statistically significant PFS prolongations are 9.1 months and 
5.4 months, respectively. These analyses are further substantiated by similar outcome in the 
sensitivity analyses for this cohort. In conclusion, as for the germline cohort, these effects are 
considered clinically relevant for the patient in a maintenance setting between two chemotherapy 
intervals.   
Women with relapsed ovarian cancer that are not BRCA mutated have limited treatment options in 
the surveillance period between two chemotherapy regimens, and there is plausible reason to treat 
patients in the maintenance phase with the purpose to postpone the next chemotherapy regimen. 
Positive treatment effect has been demonstrated in both cohorts, including the HRDneg group and 
currently there are no means of identifying patients that that are sensitive to platinum but not 
sensitive to niraparib.

The primary IRC efficacy analyses are in concordance with the statistically convincing IRC analysis 
for the secondary endpoint TFST (time to first subsequent therapy) for both cohorts. This results in 
a postponement of the next therapy of 12.6 months for the germline cohort and 4.6 months for the 
non-germline cohort, both being relevant in a clinical setting. 
Importance of unfavourable effects 
In the NOVA study, a significantly higher rate of treatment-related SAEs was reported in niraparib-
treated patients compared to patients who received placebo, 17% vs 1%. Overall, the pattern of 
AEs is similar to that observed for olaparib, another PARP inhibitor recently approved in the EU for 
platinum-sensitive recurrent BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer, except that thrombocytopenia and 
constipation are reported more commonly, and that hypertension constitutes a new safety signal 
for niraparib. Thrombocytopenia, anaemia, neutropenia, fatigue and nausea/vomiting are the 
major factors limiting the tolerability of niraparib in patients and the main reason for one or more 
dose reductions. The majority of the dose interruptions occurred early in treatment during the first 
month after treatment initiation, while dose reductions occurred primarily during the second 
month. Particularly, the mean dose of niraparib administered in the NOVA study was approximately 
195 mg/day, corresponding to a dose that is 105 mg lower than the proposed (starting) dose of 
300 mg once daily. 
Strength of evidence/Impact of uncertainties 
With reference to the importance of favourable effects in the section discussed above, the reported 
median PFS benefit in the germline cohort is not fully supported by the sensitivity analyses where 
large differences are reported between the different analyses. The median PFS estimate of 
niraparib is also uncertain, since the analysis is based on immature data. Still, it can be assumed 
that the PFS estimate lies somewhere in the range of 14.8 and 21 months, i.e. a gain in PFS of 
between 5.8 and 15.5 months as compared with the placebo arm.  Even in the lower range of this 
interval, the effect is considered to be of clinical relevance.  
Of note, OS data for olaparib have recently been published and demonstrate a positive outcome in 
the gBRCAmut cohort (Ledermann et al, 2016). Niraparib OS data are still immature.  
The large amount of dose modifications due to AEs (i.e. >70%) observed in the NOVA study is 
indicative of poor patient tolerability to the 300 mg daily dose of niraparib. Although most of the 
AEs with niraparib can be handled by dose interruptions/reductions, some AEs persisted after 
intensive dose modifications were performed (e.g. anaemia, fatigue, nausea and vomiting). Thus, 
the optimal dosing of niraparib is still uncertain. However, the daily dose of 300 mg niraparib 
should be the recommended starting dose until new relevant data are available. The applicant is 
encouraged to further investigate alternative dosing strategies in upcoming clinical trials with 
niraparib. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Efficacy has been demonstrated in all patients independent of BRCA/HRD status and the safety 
profile is manageable with dose reductions. Hence, the benefit risk balance is positive.

3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Zejula is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Zejula is not similar to Lynparza and Yondelis within 
the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Zejula is favourable in the following indication: 
Zejula is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum 
sensitive relapsed high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer 
who are in response (complete or partial) to platinum based chemotherapy. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are 
set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of 
Directive 2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-
portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this 
product within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the  
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent 
updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
Assessment report  
EMA/648982/2017 
Page 121/122 
  
  
 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile 
or as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product to be implemented by the Member States. 
Not applicable. 
These conditions fully reflect the advice received from the PRAC. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that niraparib is a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the 
European Union.

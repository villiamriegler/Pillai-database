Part VI: Summary of the risk management plan 
Summary of risk management plan for Nubeqa (Darolutamide) 
This is a summary of the RMP for Nubeqa. A Risk Management Plan (RMP) details important 
risks, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will be obtained about these 
risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Nubeqa's Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Nubeqa should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Nubeqa should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all of which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Nubeqa's 
RMP. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
I. 
Nubeqa is authorised for the treatment of adult men with non-metastatic castration resistant 
prostate cancer (nmCRPC) who are at high risk of developing metastatic disease (see SmPC for 
the full indication) and for the treatment of adult men with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate 
cancer (mHSPC) in combination with docetaxel and androgen deprivation therapy. It contains 
darolutamide as the active substance and it is administered orally. 
Further information about the evaluation of Nubeqa’s benefits can be found in Nubeqa’s EPAR, 
including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines Agency (EMA) 
website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/nubeqa. 
II. 
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks  
No important identified risks are known for Nubeqa at this point in time. All identified risks are 
classified as non-important and are managed by the following routine risk minimisation 
measures: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with or 
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report/Periodic Safety Update 
Report assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Nubeqa is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
List of important risks and missing information 
II.A 
Important risks of Nubeqa are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken. Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Nubeqa. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (e.g., on the long-term use of the medicine).

Summary of important risks 
Important potential risk: ADRs resulting from increased exposure in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
It is uncertain whether patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment 
may be at higher risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) when exposed to 
darolutamide in comparison to general target population. 
Patients with active viral hepatitis, active human immunodeficiency virus 
(HIV), chronic liver disease or with screening values of serum alanine 
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST) ≥2.5 x ULN, total 
bilirubin ≥1.5 x ULN (except patients with a diagnosis of Gilbert’s disease) 
were not eligible for inclusion in the pivotal phase III Studies 17712 
(ARAMIS) and 17777 (ARASENS). 
Based on the single dose data in non-cancer patients a 1.9-fold increase in 
darolutamide exposure AUC (0-48) was observed in 9 subjects with 
moderate hepatic impairment compared to 10healthy, age- and body 
weight-matched subjects (Study 17721, using Child-Pugh categorisation 
system for hepatic impairment).

Important potential risk: Cardiovascular events in patients with significant CV history 
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine 
The androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) associated changes in body 
composition, lipids, and insulin sensitivity are suspected to increase the 
risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disorders in prostate cancer patients. 
The overall evidence is, however, conflicting and the relationship between 
ADT and cardiovascular disorders remains unclear. 
Patients with recent (in the past 6 months) stroke, myocardial infarction, 
severe/unstable angina pectoris, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft; 
congestive heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV 
were excluded from the pivotal clinical Studies 17712 (ARAMIS) and 
17777 (ARASENS). 
It is uncertain whether patients with the medical history of recent significant 
cardiovascular events may be at higher risk for cardiovascular disorders 
(progression) in association with darolutamide exposure. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease in the past 
6 months including stroke, myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina 
pectoris, coronary/peripheral artery bypass graft, and congestive heart 
failure NYHA Class III or IV.

Important potential risk: Carcinogenicity potential 
Evidence for 
linking the risk to 
the medicine 
In the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials ARAMIS (Study 17712) and ARASENS 
(Study 17777), a slight numerical imbalance was only observed in the 
incidence of all second primary malignancies in the darolutamide+docetaxel 
arm compared to the placebo+docetaxel arm in Study 17777. However, after 
adjusting for study treatment duration, the exposure adjusted incidence rate 
(EAIR) per 100 patient years was similar between treatment arms (1.4 and 
1.3) in the darolutamide+docetaxel arm and placebo+docetaxel arm, 
respectively). 
Nonclinical safety data of darolutamide do not indicate a carcinogenic 
potential. The results of chronic toxicity studies in rats and dogs at multiples 
up to 4 to 5-fold the therapeutic exposure did not show signs of off target 
toxicity or proliferative tissue lesions indicative of a risk of secondary 
neoplasia following prolonged treatment with darolutamide. Also, 
darolutamide did not show genotoxicity in vitro and in vivo.  
In the pivotal 26-week carcinogenicity study with orally administered 
darolutamide in 001178-T (hemizygous) RasH2 mice, no darolutamide-
related effects were noted on the incidence or type of neoplasms. At the 
maximum feasible dose of 1,000 mg/kg/day, exposure was 0.9 - 1.3 times 
the clinical exposure in humans at the therapeutic dose of 600 mg BID. In 
conclusion, no carcinogenic potential was observed up to the highest 
darolutamide dose administered in the carcinogenicity study. Taking into 
account the darolutamide exposure in this study within the range of clinical 
exposure, this study may not fully exclude the potential risk of 
carcinogenicity. 
In 2-year carcinogenicity studies in rats with other second-generation 
androgen receptor inhibitor drugs in the same pharmacological class as 
darolutamide, neoplastic findings of unknown relevance to humans were 
observed. 
Risk factors and 
risk groups 
As described in literature, risk factors include radiation, tobacco use, alcohol 
use, high body mass index, and high fasting plasma glucose.

SmPC,  Annex 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
II,  Labelling 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
and PL 
Aripiprazole Accord in the approved indication remains 
favourable and therefore recommended the renewal of the 
marketing authorisation with unlimited validity. 
Changes were made to the PI  to bring it in line with the 
current Agency/QRD  template, SmPC  guideline and other 
relevant guideline(s).

1.  Introduction 
On 27 September 2022, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric RAINBOW EXTENSION study 
(CRFB002H2301E) for Lucentis (ranibizumab), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) 
No1901/2006, as amended. 
These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measures. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The Lucentis (ranibizumab) clinical development program in ROP includes two paediatric clinical 
studies. H2301 was a 24-week randomized, controlled clinical trial comparing two doses of 
ranibizumab (0.2 mg and 0.1 mg) to laser therapy for the treatment of ROP in preterm infants. The 
primary objective of this study was to demonstrate that intravitreal ranibizumab 0.2 mg had superior 
efficacy to laser therapy in the treatment of ROP as measured by the absence of active ROP and 
absence of unfavourable structural outcomes in both eyes 24 weeks after starting study treatment, as 
assessed by the Investigator. 
Based on the results from core Study CRFB002H2301, Lucentis® (ranibizumab) 0.2 mg was approved 
in the EU in 09/2019 for the treatment of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in preterm infants with 
zone I (stage 1+, 2+, 3 or 3+), zone II (stage 3+) or AP-ROP (aggressive posterior ROP) disease.  
Study H 2301E1 was designed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of intravitreal ranibizumab 
compared to laser ablation therapy in preterm neonates with ROP. All patients who successfully 
completed the core study were invited to participate in the extension study and were followed up to 
their 5th birthday.  
Two interim analyses were performed previously as prespecified in the H2301E1 protocol. The first 
interim analysis was conducted to comply with the plan for specific follow-up as agreed with EMA's 
Paediatric Committee in the Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) and provided data on ocular structural 
abnormalities in patients 40 weeks after the start of intravitreal ranibizumab treatment in Study 
H2301.  
The second interim analysis (IA2) evaluated long-term efficacy and safety data, including data on 
ocular structural abnormalities, ocular and visual function, VA, and additional cognitive and growth 
assessments at the patient’s 2 years corrected age. The results from this analysis were also reported in 
a publication (Marlow et al 2021). 
This report presents cumulative study results of the final analysis, up to the end of Study H2301E1 
when the last patient had completed their 5th birthday visit (data cut-off 21-Apr-2022).  
At the time of the approval, the MAH agreed that the results of the final report for H2301E1 be subject 
to a Category 1 commitment (Annex II D condition) as a PAES, interventional, with a due date 
30-Jun-2023 for submission of final study results.  
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Ranibizumab is formulated as a sterile solution for intravitreal injection, aseptically filled in a sterile 
glass vial at a concentration of 10 mg/mL. 
EMA/CHMP/956289/2022  
Page 4/17 
 
  
 
 
The formulation is presented as a single-use sterile, clear to slightly opalescent, colourless to pale  
yellow and preservative free aqueous solution for intravitreal injection supplied in glass vials.  
All primary packaging materials are standard quality, suitable for packaging sterile liquid  
products, and comply with relevant pharmacopeial requirements. 
A syringe suitable to accurately deliver volumes of 10 μL and 20 μL of the solution into the eye was 
used. This syringe is a sterile, single-use disposable syringe intended for medical purposes. The 
syringe was individually packaged. A standard injection needle (e.g., 30 G, ½ inch stainless steel) as 
for the adults will be used for the injection in premature neonates. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Ranibizumab is a recombinant humanized immunoglobulin G1 kappa (IgG1κ) isotype monoclonal 
antibody fragment that selectively binds VEGF-A. It binds with high affinity to the receptor binding site 
of active forms of VEGF-A, including the biologically active, cleaved form of this molecule, VEGF110. 
VEGF-A has been shown to cause neovascularization and leakage in models of ocular angiogenesis. The 
binding of ranibizumab to VEGF-A prevents the interaction of VEGF-A with its receptors (VEGFR1 and 
VEGFR2) on the surface of endothelial cells, reducing endothelial cell proliferation, vascular leakage, 
and new blood vessel formation. 
Lucentis is indicated in adults for: 
• The treatment of neovascular (wet) age-related macular degeneration (AMD) 
• The treatment of visual impairment due to diabetic macular oedema (DME) 
• The treatment of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) 
• The treatment of visual impairment due to macular oedema secondary to retinal vein  
occlusion (branch RVO or central RVO) 
• The treatment of visual impairment due to choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) 
Lucentis is indicated in preterm infants for: 
• The treatment of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) with zone I (stage 1+, 2+, 3 or 3+),  
zone II (stage 3+) or AP-ROP (aggressive posterior ROP) disease. 
Background of prior clinical paediatric Core study CRFB002H2301  
Ranibizumab was investigated as a potential treatment for ROP in Study H2301, a randomized, open-
label, three-arm parallel-group trial comparing intravitreal ranibizumab at two dose levels (0.1 mg and 
0.2 mg) to laser ablation therapy in the treatment of ROP in preterm infants with a birth weight of < 
1500 g and bilateral ROP. To be eligible, patients had to have one of the following retinal findings in 
each eye: 
• Zone I, stage 1+, 2+, 3 or 3+ disease, or 
• Zone II, stage 3+ disease, or 
• Aggressive posterior (AP)-ROP. 
The results demonstrated that ranibizumab 0.2 mg was an efficacious and safe treatment for preterm 
neonates with ROP up to 24 weeks of treatment. Patients treated with ranibizumab 0.2 mg were 2 
times more likely to achieve treatment success (defined as absence of active ROP and absence of 
unfavorable structural outcomes in both eyes 24 weeks after the first study treatment) compared with 
laser therapy. This was not statistically significant as  the  one-sided p-value was above the 
significance level of 0.025 but it was nevertheless considered clinically relevant. Treatment with 
ranibizumab was safe and well tolerated in patients with ROP.

efficacy and safety of ranibizumab compared with laser therapy for the treatment of infants born 
prematurely with retinopathy of prematurity. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Study CRFB002H2301E1  
RAINBOW extension study: an extension study to evaluate the long-term 
efficacy and safety of ranibizumab compared with laser therapy for the 
treatment of infants born prematurely with retinopathy of prematurity. 
Description 
Methods 
Objectives 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of intravitreal ranibizumab 
compared with laser ablation therapy in patients who were treated for retinopathy of prematurity 
(ROP) in the core study CRFB002H2301 
Study design 
This was a multicentre, open-label extension study where the VA assessment at the child's 5th 
birthday visit was performed by an assessor who was masked to study treatment. The study had 2 
distinct periods (Epochs). Treatment with study ranibizumab (either as re-treatment after ranibizumab  
had  already  been  injected  in  the  same  eye  or  as  switch  ranibizumab treatment from study laser 
therapy administered in the core study) was permitted for eligible eyes with recurrence/worsening of 
ROP up to and including Week 40 from the baseline visit in the core study (Epoch 1). The remainder of 
the extension study up to the 5th birthday visit (Epoch 2) was observational, with no study treatment 
planned to be administered. 
Study population/ Sample size 
The study population consisted of male and female preterm infants/children who had successfully 
completed the 24-week core study H2301 and met eligibility for this study [Study H2301E1-Section 
9.3]. 
Key inclusion criteria: 
• Signed informed consent from parent(s) or legal guardian(s), in compliance with local requirements 
• The patient successfully completed the core study H2301, as defined by providing assessments at the 
Visit 112 (the last scheduled visit in the core study) or, if appropriate, at the last of the additional 
assessment visits as per protocol in H2301, whichever was latest 
• The patient received study treatment in both eyes at baseline of study H2301 
Key exclusion criteria: 
• Patient had a medical condition or personal circumstance which precluded study participation or 
EMA/CHMP/956289/2022  
Page 6/17 
 
  
 
 
 
compliance with study procedures, as assessed by the Investigator 
• Patient had been discontinued from the core study H2301 at any time  
Treatments 
Ranibizumab solution for injection was supplied (open label) in vials. Each vial contained ranibizumab 
in the concentration of 10 mg/mL (labeled as ‘RFB002 0.5 mg/0.05 mL’). 
Treatment received at the baseline visit in core study (H2301): Ranibizumab 0.1 mg, Ranibizumab 0.2 
mg, Laser 
Ranibizumab dose in extension study (H2301E1) could be given during Epoch 1, the duration of which 
was up to and including 40 weeks after the first study treatment in the core study H2301 [Study 
H2301E1-Section 9.4].: Ranibizumab 0.1 mg, Ranibizumab 0.2 mg, Ranibizumab 0.2 mg

home as  measured in days/months at the patient’s 2 years corrected age, at the patient’s 5th 
birthday. 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
In the core study, patients were randomized to 1 of the 3 treatment arms (ranibizumab 0.2 mg, 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg, and laser). Treatment arm assignment and patient identifier in the extension 
study remained the same as in the core study.  
This is an open-label study where the VA assessment at the child's 5th birthday visit was performed by 
an assessor who was masked to study treatment. The investigators, patients/parents/legal guardians 
and the Clinical Trial Team (CTT) were unmasked to the treatments administered during the core and 
extension studies. 
Statistical Methods 
All analyses were carried out on the Extension Safety Set, which was a subset of the Safety Set  
from the core study.  
For the purposes of classifying an eye by ROP disease status, the worst disease present in any clock  
hour of the eye, ranked in descending order from worst to best, was used to classify the eye at core  
baseline and during the study. The better-seeing eye and the worse-seeing eye at the 5th birthday 
visit were defined as the eye with a higher and lower ETDRS letter score, respectively. If both eyes had 
the same ETDRS letter score, then the left eye was assigned as the worse-seeing eye. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the VA score in the better-seeing eye at the patients’ 5th birthday 
visit, as recorded by the investigator.  
As the primary hypothesis testing in the core study did not show statistical significance, no hypothesis  
testing was carried out for the primary endpoint in the extension study and only descriptive statistics 
(i.e., point estimate, and the 95% confidence interval) are provided for the comparison between 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg and laser. Summary statistics were calculated based on a stratified analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) model with VA as the continuous response variable, ROP zone (I and II) at core 
baseline and treatment arm as factors. 
Two-sided 95% confidence intervals, assuming normality, were produced for the VA within each 
treatment arm and the difference in VA between a pair of treatment arms was calculated from least 
squares means. No p-values are displayed for this analysis. 
The planned analysis for the secondary endpoint of ‘recurrence of ROP up to 52 weeks post-baseline  
visit in the core study’ was not carried out. Patients were able to receive study treatment up to Week 
40 only, after which the study was purely observational. Results from this analysis would have been 
identical to those for the ‘recurrence of ROP up to 40 weeks post-baseline visit in the core study’ since 
recurrence (defined as ROP receiving any post-baseline intervention after the 1st study treatment in 
the core study) remained unchanged at Week 52. Therefore, this analysis at Week 52 was not 
considered meaningful by the MAH and thus not performed. 
Apart from the analysis of systemic safety risks based on the search criteria defined in the program-
level electronic Case Retrieval Strategy (eCRS), an analysis based on a broader medical review of all 
relevant AEs that could be considered related to overall developmental impairment associated with 
CNS disorders was also performed. 
Results 
Baseline data  
Baseline demographics and ROP disease characteristics of the Extension Safety Set were generally  
comparable across treatment arms and representative of the Enrolled Set from the core study. More  
than half of all patients were Caucasian (61.1%) and approximately half were female (52.2%). The 
mean gestational age at birth was 26.1 weeks (with a slightly higher proportion of patients in the 
EMA/CHMP/956289/2022  
Page 8/17 
 
  
 
 
gestational age category ≤ 24 weeks for ranibizumab 0.2 mg than for ranibizumab 0.1 mg and laser), 
and the mean corrected age at extension baseline was 25.05 weeks. The mean birth weight was lower 
in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg arm (793.2 g) than in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg arm (862.4 g) and the laser 
arm (859.4 g). Overall, ROP was present in Zone I in 38.3% of patients and in Zone II in 61.7% of 
patients. 
Number analysed 
Of the 201 infants who had completed the core study, 180 (90%) were enrolled in this extension study  
and 156 (86.7%) completed the 5-year evaluation. Of the patients who had completed their 5th 
birthday visit, 79.5% had their vision assessed by ETDRS (83.3%, 78.2% and 76.6% for ranibizumab 
0.2 mg, ranibizumab 0.1 mg, and laser, respectively).  
The majority of patients (76.7%) had stage 3+ disease. 
Protocol deviations:  
Overall, 19 patients (10.6%) had at least one protocol deviation, with the proportion of patients with  
protocol deviations balanced across treatment arms. The most common protocol deviation was missing  
a visit due to Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) (5.0%), followed by delaying a visit due to 
COVID-19 (2.2%). One patient in the laser arm had a protocol deviation with impact on the primary 
efficacy endpoint of VA - the VA assessment at the 5th birthday visit was performed by an unmasked 
assessor who knew which study treatment the patient had received at core study baseline 
Exposure:  
In both ranibizumab arms, the majority of patients (77.0% for ranibizumab 0.2 mg and 76.9% for 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg) received only the initial ranibizumab treatment in the core study. The mean 
number of injections per patient was the same for both ranibizumab arms (2.5 injections). In the laser 
arm, 11 patients (20.4%) switched to ranibizumab treatment during the core study, with a mean of 
2.4 injections per patient. Apart from one patient in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg arm who received 
ranibizumab retreatment in both eyes at the extension baseline visit, no further study treatments were 
given during the extension study. 
Efficacy results 
Overall, 180 of the 201 patients who completed the core study (89.6%) entered the extension study 
and 156/180 (86.7%) completed the 5th birthday visit. The number/proportion of completers was 
comparable across the three treatment arms [Study H2301E-Section 10.1]. 
Two patients discontinued the post-treatment follow-up 1 (from Extension baseline to Week 40): one 
(1.9%) in the laser arm died and one (1.6%) in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg arm withdrew consent.  In 
post-treatment follow-up 2 (from Week 40 to the patient’s 5th birthday visit), discontinuations were 
reported for 6 patients (9.8%) in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg arm, 10 patients (15.4%) in the ranibizumab 
0.1 mg arm, and 6 patients (11.1%) in the laser arm. The most common reasons for discontinuation 
from post-treatment follow-up 2 were withdrawal of informed consent and loss to follow-up, with no 
meaningful differences between the treatment groups [Study H2301E1-Section 10.1].  
Primary efficacy results 
The primary objective was to evaluate the visual function of patients by assessing the visual acuity 
(ETDRS with Lea symbols optotypes) in the better-seeing eye at the patient’s 5th birthday.  
The better-seeing eye was defined as the eye with the higher ETDRS score at the 5th birthday  
visit. Visual acuity using ETDRS could not be assessed for all patients due to cognitive impairment or 
other reasons. 
Overall, 79.5% (124/156) of the patients who completed the 5th birthday visit had an ETDRS score 
recorded. Of the 5th birthday visit completers, similar proportions across the treatment arms had an 
ETDRS score record: 83.3% (45/54) in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg arm, 78.2% (43/55) in the 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg arm, and 76.6% (36/47) in the laser arm.  
EMA/CHMP/956289/2022  
Page 9/17 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The LS means of the ETDRS score in the better-seeing eye was numerically higher in the ranibizumab 
0.2 mg arm compared to the laser arm. The difference in LS means between the ranibizumab 0.2 mg 
and laser arms was 4.7 letters (95% CI: -1.1, 10.5). The difference in LS mean ETDRS score between 
the ranibizumab 0.1 mg and laser arms was 2.5 (95%CI: -3.4, 8.3). [Study H2301E1-Section 11.1]. 
Secondary efficacy results 
Visual Acuity 
Visual acuity of the worse-seeing eye 
The LS mean ETDRS letter score in the worse-seeing eye at the 5th birthday visit was numerically 
higher for ranibizumab 0.2 mg than for ranibizumab 0.1 mg and laser. The difference in LS means 
between the ranibizumab 0.2 mg and laser arms in the worse-seeing eye was 8.0 letters (95% CI: -
0.8, 16.7). The difference in LS means between the ranibizumab 0.1 mg and laser arms was 1.6 letters 
(95%CI: -7.3, 10.5) [Study H2301E1-Section 11.2.1]. 
Low visual acuity 
Low Visual Acuity Testing was only performed in patients who had a score of either ‘0’ or ‘missing’ on 
the ETDRS assessment and is presented by best and worst eye separately (as defined by ROP disease 
status at core study baseline). Results of an ETDRS assessment would be considered ‘missing’ if the 
ETDRS assessment could not be performed due to cognitive impairment or other reasons [Study 
H2301E1-Section 11.2.1].  
The number of best eyes with an ETDRS score of ‘0’ or ‘missing’ in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg, 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg, and laser arms, was 10, 12 and 13, respectively. Of those, 2, 2 and 3 best eyes 
in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg, ranibizumab 0.1 mg, and laser arms, respectively, had a Low Visual Acuity 
Testing record.  
The number of worst eyes with an ETDRS score of ‘0’ or ‘missing’ in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg, 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg, and laser arms, was 9, 16, and 12, respectively. Of those, 1, 5 and 2 worst eyes 
in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg, ranibizumab 0.1 mg, and laser arms, respectively, had a Low Visual Acuity 
Testing record.  
The vision of an eye assessed with Low Visual Acuity Testing was scored based on a ‘Yes’ answer in the 
order of 'Count fingers' > 'Hand movement' > 'Light perception'. If all assessments had answers 'No', 
the best vision was 'None of the above'. All best eyes with a Low Visual Acuity Testing record had an 
answer ‘Yes’ to at least one of the assessments. Of all the worst eyes with a Low Visual Acuity Testing 
record, 2 in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg arm and 1 in the laser arm had answers ‘No’ to all assessments, 
resulting in a score of 'None of the above.' [Study H2301E1-Section 11.2.1].  
Absence of ocular structural abnormalities 
Overall, the absence of all ocular structural abnormalities was observed in a higher proportion of 
patients in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg arm (98.3%) and the ranibizumab 0.1 mg arm (93.8%) than in the 
laser arm (88.7%). The odds of an absence of all ocular structural abnormalities were 7.77 times 
higher in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg arm than in the laser arm (95% CI: 0.8838, 68.2337; p = 0.0172). 
No child developed new structural ocular abnormalities after Week 40 post-core baseline - the absence 
of all ocular structural abnormalities was observed in the same proportion at the patient’s 5th birthday 
visit as at the patient’s 2 years corrected age and at Week 40 [Study H2301E1-Section 11.2.2]. 
Absence of active ROP 
All patients with available results at the Week 40 visit had an absence of active ROP. At Week 52, all 
patients had an absence of active ROP except for 1 patient in the laser arm. For this patient, ROP was 
reported in three clock hours of the left eye (Zone II Stage 3, without presence of vascular changes), 
EMA/CHMP/956289/2022  
Page 10/17 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
which was subsequently reported as resolved at the 2 years corrected age visit [Study H2301E1-
Section 11.2.3]. 
Recurrence of ROP 
Recurrence of ROP was defined as ROP receiving any post-baseline intervention after the 1st study 
treatment in the core study. In the ranibizumab arms, post-baseline interventions were ranibizumab 
retreatment or switch to laser. In the laser arm, post-baseline interventions were supplementary laser 
treatments after 11 days post-baseline, or switch to ranibizumab; supplementary laser treatment 
within 11 days post-baseline was not counted as recurrence. In the Extension Safety Set, the 
proportion of patients receiving post-baseline intervention up to Week 40 was comparable across the 
two ranibizumab arms (19 patients, 31.1% for ranibizumab 0.2 mg and 22 patients, 33.8% for 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg).  In the laser arm, 11 patients (20.4%) received post-baseline intervention. This 
number excluded the additional 7 patients (13.0%) who received supplementary laser within 11 days 
post-baseline. No recurrence of ROP requiring retreatment occurred in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg arm 
during the extension study. One patient in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg arm received retreatment in both 
eyes at the extension baseline visit, which was the latest ROP recurrence requiring retreatment [Study 
H2301E1-Section 11.2.4].  
Occurrence of myopia and high myopia 
Refractive error was categorized into myopia (-0.25 diopters or worse) and high myopia (-5.00 
diopters or worse). At the 5th birthday visit, the occurrence of myopia was lower for both eyes in the 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg arm compared to the laser arm (Best eye: 36.5 % vs. 50 %, Worst Eye: 48.1% 
vs. 56.5%) Similarly, high myopia was less frequently observed in both eyes for ranibizumab 0.2 mg 
compared to laser (Best eye: 5.8% vs. 19.6%, Worst eye: 5.8% vs. 17.4%). While the occurrence of 
myopia was similar in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg and laser arms, high myopia was less frequent in the 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg arm than in the laser arm. [Study H2301E1-Table 11-5]. 
Exploratory results  
Nystagmus, abnormal fixation behavior, strabismus, and abnormal pupillary light reaction  
Ocular findings of nystagmus, abnormal fixation behavior, strabismus, and abnormal pupillary light 
reaction were reported with similar frequencies in both eyes and across the 3 treatment arms at the 
5th birthday visit. The total number of patients with at least one ocular finding in the best eye was 14 
(26.9%) for ranibizumab 0.2 mg, 13 (23.6%) for ranibizumab 0.1 mg and 14 (29.8%) for laser, and 
the total number of patients with at least one ocular finding in the worst eye was 12 (23.1%) for 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg, 13 (24.1%) for ranibizumab 0.1 mg and 14 (29.8%) for laser. Similar frequencies 
of ocular findings were reported at the 3 years corrected age visit. At the 2 years corrected age visit, 
numerically fewer patients overall had ocular findings in both eyes in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg arm than 
in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg and laser arms [Study H2301E1-Section 11.3.1].  
Children visual function questionnaire 
Overall, the composite and subscale scores of the CVFQ were comparable across treatment arms at the 
patient’s 5th birthday visit. The mean (SD) composite scores were 79.07 (13.191) in  the ranibizumab 
0.2 mg arm, 78.08 (11.743) in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg arm, and 78.13 (11.991) in the laser arm. 
Numerically similar scores were observed at the 2 years corrected age visit and the 3 years corrected 
age visit, with no significant differences between treatment arms at either of the visits 
[StudyH2301E1-Section 11.3.2].  
Cardiff acuity test 
CAT was added at the patient’s 2 and 3 year visit in protocol amendment v01. Consequently, at the 
Year 2 visit CAT was conducted only in patients who attended the study visit following approval and 
implementation of the amendment (67/180 patients) [Study H2301E1-IA2 Report-Section 6.5.1].  
At 2 years corrected age, LogMAR VA scores (larger LogMAR scores indicating poorer VA) for the 
binocular assessment were reported for 22 patients in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg arm, 26 patients in the 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg arm, and 19 patients in the laser arm. A numerical difference favoring 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg compared to ranibizumab 0.1 mg and laser was observed, with mean (SD) values 
of 0.38 (0.30), 0.43 (0.32) and 0.47 (0.28), respectively. 
EMA/CHMP/956289/2022  
Page 11/17 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
At the patient’s 3 years corrected age visit, VA scores for the binocular assessment were reported for 
48 patients in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group, 45 patients in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg group, and 42 
patients in the laser group. A numerical difference favoring ranibizumab 0.2 mg compared to 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg and laser was observed, with mean (SD) values of 0.23 (0.21), 0.30 (0.25) and 
0.31 (0.25), respectively. LogMAR scores for the binocular and monocular assessment across all 3 
treatment arms were numerically lower overall at 3 years corrected age than at 2 years corrected age, 
indicating an improvement in visual acuity over time [Study H2301E1-Section 11.3.3]. 
Visual function assessment 
Peripheral vision was assessed by the Investigator at the patient’s 5th birthday visit. Overall, the 
results for peripheral vision were comparable across treatment arms. For the majority of patients in all 
3 treatment arms, the binocular assessments of peripheral vision were reported as normal or minor 
impairment, with only 1 patient (2.5%) in the laser arm having a reported major impairment [Study 
H2301E1-Section 11.3.4].  
Full peripheral retinal vascularization 
More patients had full peripheral retinal vascularization in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg arm than in the 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg or laser arms, at both the patient’s 2 years corrected age and the 5th birthday 
visit. At 2 years corrected age, full peripheral retinal vascularization was reported in 33 patients 
(56.9%) in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg arm and in 26 patients (44.8%) in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg arm. 
Full peripheral retinal vascularization was not anticipated to occur in patients in the laser arm due to 
the nature of laser ablation therapy, where the resulting scar tissue prevents vascularization to 
progress past this boundary towards the periphery. However, occurrence of full peripheral retinal 
vascularization was reported in 9 patients (18.0%) from the laser arm. At the 5th birthday visit, full 
peripheral retinal vascularization was reported in 30 patients (56.6%) in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg arm, 
23 patients (41.1%) in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg arm and 13 patients (27.7%) in the laser arm [Study 
H2301E1-Section 11.3.5]. 
Safety results 
All analyses were carried out on the Extension Safety Set, which was a subset of the Safety Set from 
the core study and included all patients who had entered the extension study.  
The ocular safety events were collected as study endpoints only as specified per the protocol, and were 
not recorded as AEs. Safety assessments consisted of ocular examinations and collection of  
ocular and non-ocular AEs and SAEs. They also included monitoring of haematology, serum chemistry 
and urine as part of routine clinical practice, as well as assessment of vital signs, hearing function and 
respiratory function [Study H2301E1-Section 9.5.2]. 
The majority of patients (77.0% for ranibizumab 0.2 mg and 76.9% for ranibizumab 0.1 mg) received 
only the initial ranibizumab treatment administered in the core study with a mean number of injection 
of 2.5 per patient. In the laser arm, 11 patients (20.4%) switched to ranibizumab treatment during the 
core study, with a mean of 2.4 injections per patient. Apart from one patient in the ranibizumab 0.1 
mg arm who received ranibizumab retreatment in both eyes at the extension baseline visit, no further 
study treatments were given during the extension study. [Study H2301E1-Section 10.6.1].  
Ocular adverse events 
• Overall, 67 patients (37.2%) experienced ocular AEs, with a numerically lower incidence of AEs in the 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg arm (31.1%) than in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg (40.0%) and laser (40.7%) arms. 
The most frequent ocular AEs overall were strabismus (18.9%), myopia (7.8%), and conjunctivitis 
(5.6%). A higher incidence of strabismus and conjunctivitis was reported in the laser arm than in the 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg arm. Apart from a lower rate of myopia and a higher rate of nystagmus, 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg had a similar AE profile as laser [Study H2301E1 -Table 12-1].  
• The majority of ocular AEs were mild or moderate in severity. Severe ocular AEs were reported for 
3.9% of patients overall, with no clinically relevant differences between the ranibizumab 0.2 mg, 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg and laser arms (3.3%, 4.6%, and 3.7%, respectively). The only ocular AE that 
was suspected to be related to the study treatment was an event of strabismus of moderate severity in 
the laser arm [Study H2301E1-Section 12.1.2.2].  
• Ocular SAEs were reported for 8 patients (4.4%) overall, with no ocular SAEs reported in the 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg arm. The most frequent ocular SAEs overall were retinal detachment and ROP, 
EMA/CHMP/956289/2022  
Page 12/17 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
each reported in 2 patients (1.1%). None of the ocular SAEs were suspected by the Investigator to be 
related to study procedure/treatment [Study H2301E1-Section 12.2.2]. 
• There were no ocular AEs leading to permanent study discontinuation; one patient each in the 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg and laser arms had progression/worsening of ROP leading to study treatment 
discontinuation [Study H2301E1-Section 12.2.3]. 
Non-ocular adverse events 
• Overall, 145 patients (80.6%) experienced non-ocular AEs, with the lowest incidence in the 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg arm (75.4%), followed by the ranibizumab 0.1 mg arm (81.5%) and the laser arm 
(85.2%). The most frequently reported non-ocular AEs overall were nasopharyngitis (17.2%), pyrexia 
(17.2%), and bronchitis (12.2%). Developmental delay, otitis media, bronchiolitis, ear infection and 
laryngospasm were reported more frequently for ranibizumab 0.2 mg than for laser. Apart from a 
higher rate of bronchiolitis ranibizumab 0.1 mg had a comparable non-ocular AE profile as the laser 
arm [Study H2301E1-Section 12.1.1]. 
• The majority of non-ocular AEs were mild or moderate in severity. Severe non-ocular AEs were 
reported for 18.3% of patients overall, with no clinically relevant differences between the ranibizumab 
0.2 mg, ranibizumab 0.1 mg and laser arms (21.3%, 15.4%, and 18.5%, respectively) [Study 
H2301E1-Section 12.1.2.2].  
• Non-ocular SAEs were reported in 69 patients (38.3%) overall, with a higher proportion of patients 
with non-ocular SAEs in the laser arm (46.3%) than in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg and 0.1 mg arms 
(34.4% and 35.4%, respectively). The most frequent non-ocular SAEs overall were bronchitis (6.1%), 
pneumonia (5.6%,) and bronchiolitis (3.9%). The incidence of bronchiolitis and febrile convulsion was 
higher for ranibizumab 0.2 mg than for laser. SAEs of developmental delay were reported in the 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg arm only. Apart from one SAE of pharyngitis in the laser treatment arm and one 
SAE of pulmonary hypertension in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg treatment arm, all other non-ocular SAEs 
were not suspected by the Investigator to be related to study procedure/study treatment [Study 
H2301E1-Section 12.2.2].  
• Two deaths were reported during the extension study, both in the laser arm. Neither death was 
suspected by the Investigator of being related to study treatment or procedure [Study H2301E1-
Section 12.2.1]. 
• There were no non-ocular AEs leading to permanent study discontinuation [Study H2301E1-Section 
12.2.3].  
• The overall incidence of neurodevelopmental impairment-related terms based on the eCRS search 
strategy was balanced between the ranibizumab 0.2 mg and laser treatment arms. Based on a medical 
review of all AEs of neuro-/developmental impairment, it was confirmed that these events were 
predominantly reported in patients born extremely premature, i.e. with an extremely low birth weight 
≤1000g, and a history of CNS lesions prior to first treatment at core study baseline. None of the 
neuro-/developmental impairment AEs were assessed as related to ranibizumab treatment by the 
investigator. Within the AEs of neuro-/developmental impairment related terms, a higher number of  
events of developmental delay and motor developmental delay was reported in the ranibizumab 0.2 
mg arm as compared to laser. It should be noted that the mean gestational age at birth as well as 
birth weight for the pre-term infants randomized to ranibizumab 0.2 mg (25.8 weeks; 793.2 g) was 
lower as compared to that for the laser arm (26.4 weeks; 859.4 g) [Study H2301E1-Section 12.7]. 
Additional safety assessments 
Mullen Scales of Early Learning and Gross Motor function were used to assess the long-term effects of 
ranibizumab treatment on the neurodevelopmental outcomes of cognitive and motor development. 
• The cognitive status of patients as assessed by Mullen Scales of Early Learning was comparable 
across treatment arms both at the patient’s 2 years corrected age and at the 5thbirthday visit. At both 
time points, the majority of patients in each treatment arm showed low impairment (Level 1) or no 
impairment (Level 0) of their gross motor ability. The proportion of patients with no impairment in the 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg, ranibizumab 0.1 mg, and laser arms respectively was 39.3%, 41.5% and 20.4% 
at 2 years corrected age and 45.9%, 41.5% and 37.0% at the 5th birthday visit. The proportion of 
patients with low impairment was 36.1%, 33.8% and 44.4% at 2 years corrected age and 31.1%, 
35.4% and 33.3% at the 5th birthday visit. [Study H2301E1-Section 12.6.3].  
• Laboratory data, vital signs, growth parameters, hearing and respiratory function, and duration of 
hospitalization all demonstrated comparable results between treatment arms [Study H2301E1-Section-
EMA/CHMP/956289/2022  
Page 13/17 
 
  
 
 
 
 
12.6.4]. 
MAH Overall conclusions 
• Preterm infants with ROP treated with ranibizumab 0.2 mg showed better visual acuity, higher rate of 
absence of ocular structural abnormalities, and reduced rates of myopia and high myopia compared 
with laser therapy at the patient’s 5th birthday visit.  
• Based on the results of the assessments in Study H2301E1, Ranibizumab 0.2 mg is safe and well-
tolerated in patients with ROP up to the patient’s 5th birthday. The long-term safety profile of 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg was in line with safety data from the core study, with no new safety signals 
observed. Results from extension Study H2301E1 demonstrated the long-term efficacy  and safety  of 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg for the treatment of pre-term infants with retinopathy of prematurity and the 
results are consistent with the favorable benefit/risk profile that was established in the core study.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of intravitreal ranibizumab 
compared with laser ablation therapy in patients who were treated for retinopathy of prematurity 
(ROP) in the core study CRFB002H2301. 
Of the 201 infants who had completed the core study, 180 (90%) were enrolled in this extension study  
and 156 (86.7%) completed the 5-year evaluation, the proportion of completers was comparable 
across the three treatment arms. Apart from one patient in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg arm who received 
ranibizumab retreatment in both eyes at the extension baseline visit, no further study treatments were 
given during the extension study. 
The primary endpoint was set as Visual acuity assessed by ETDRS with Lea symbols optotypes in the  
better-seeing eye at the patient’s 5thbirthday visit as recorded by the masked accessor (79.5% of 
patients could be assessed by ETDRS) and was numerically higher in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg arm 
compared to the laser arm with 4.7 letters (95% CI: -1.1, 10.5) and in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg 
compared to laser arm with 2.5 letters (95%CI: -3.4, 8.3). 
Regarding the secondary endpoints, the LS mean ETDRS letter score in the worse-seeing eye at the 
5th birthday visit was numerically higher for ranibizumab 0.2 mg than for ranibizumab 0.1 mg and 
laser.   
Low Visual Acuity Testing was only performed in patients who had a score of either ‘0’ or ‘missing’ on 
the ETDRS assessment and is presented by best and worst eye separately. Overall, patients in the 
ranibizumab 0.2 arm score best in comparison with the other arms.  
Absence of all ocular structural abnormalities was observed in a higher proportion of patients in the 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg arm (98.3%) and the ranibizumab 0.1 mg arm (93.8%) than in the laser arm 
(88.7%). The odds of an absence of all ocular structural abnormalities were 7.77 times higher in the 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg arm than in the laser arm. No child developed new structural ocular abnormalities 
after Week 40 post-core baseline - the absence of all ocular structural abnormalities was observed in 
the same proportion at the patients’ 5th birthday visit as at the patients’ 2 year’s corrected age and at 
Week 40. 
All patients with available results at the Week 40 visit had an absence of active ROP. At Week 52, all 
patients had an absence of active ROP except for 1 patient in the laser arm. which was subsequently 
reported as resolved at the 2 years corrected age visit. 
The proportion of patients receiving post-baseline intervention up to Week 40 was comparable across 
the two ranibizumab arms (19 patients, 31.1% for ranibizumab 0.2 mg and 22 patients, 33.8% for 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg). In the laser arm, 11 patients (20.4%) received post-baseline intervention. No

recurrence of ROP requiring retreatment occurred in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg arm during the extension 
study. This confirms long-term effect of the ranibizumab treatment. One patient in the ranibizumab 0.1 
mg arm received retreatment in both eyes at the extension baseline visit, which was the latest ROP 
recurrence requiring retreatment.  
At the 5th birthday visit, the occurrence of myopia was lower for both eyes in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg 
arm compared to the laser arm (Best eye: 36.5 % vs. 50 %, Worst Eye: 48.1% vs. 56.5%) Similarly, 
high myopia was less frequently observed in both eyes for ranibizumab 0.2 mg compared to laser 
(Best eye: 5.8% vs. 19.6%, Worst eye: 5.8% vs. 17.4%). While the occurrence of myopia was similar 
in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg and laser arms, high myopia was less frequent in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg 
arm than in the laser arm. 
Regarding Exploratory results, ‘Nystagmus, abnormal fixation behavior, strabismus, and abnormal 
pupillary light reaction’ and ‘Children visual function questionnaire’ showed overall comparable results 
across treatment arms at the patient’s 5th birthday visit. 
CAT (Cardiff acuity test) was added at the patient’s 2 and 3 year visit. LogMAR scores for the binocular 
and monocular assessment across all 3 treatment arms were numerically lower overall at 3 years 
corrected age than at 2 years corrected age, indicating an improvement in visual acuity over time. 
Peripheral vision results at the patient’s 5th birthday visit were comparable across treatment arms.  
More patients had full peripheral retinal vascularization in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg arm than in the 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg or laser arms, at both the patient’s 2 years corrected age and the 5th birthday 
visit. At the 5th birthday visit, full peripheral retinal vascularization was reported in 30 patients 
(56.6%) in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg arm, 23 patients (41.1%) in the ranibizumab 0.1 mg arm and 13 
patients (27.7%) in the laser arm. 
With regards to safety, the incidence of ocular AEs was lower in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg group 
(31.1%) compared to the ranibizumab 0.1 mg (40.0%) and laser group (40.7%). Severe ocular AEs 
showed no clinically relevant differences between the ranibizumab 0.2 mg, ranibizumab 0.1 mg and 
laser arms (3.3%, 4.6%, and 3.7%).  
The incidence of non-ocular AEs was lowest in the ranibizumab 0.2 mg arm (75.4%), followed by the 
ranibizumab 0.1 mg arm (81.5%) and the laser arm (85.2%).  
The most frequently reported non-ocular AEs overall were nasopharyngitis (17.2%), pyrexia (17.2%), 
and bronchitis (12.2%), with no non-ocular AEs leading to permanent study discontinuations.  
There was a higher proportion of patients with non-ocular SAEs in the laser arm (46.3%) than in the 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg and 0.1 mg arms (34.4% and 35.4%, respectively). The most frequent non-ocular 
SAEs overall were bronchitis (6.1%), pneumonia (5.6%,) and bronchiolitis (3.9%) with no non-ocular 
AEs leading to permanent study discontinuation Two deaths occurred during H2301E1, with both 
patients from the laser group never having received any ranibizumab treatment. 
The overall incidence of neurodevelopmental impairment-related terms was similar between the 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg (16.4%) and laser treatment arms (16.7%). According to the MAH, a medical 
review confirmed that these events were predominantly reported in patients born extremely 
premature. None of the neuro-/developmental impairment AEs were assessed as related to 
ranibizumab treatment. Within the AEs of neuro-/developmental impairment related terms, a higher 
number of events of developmental delay and motor developmental delay was reported in the 
ranibizumab 0.2 mg arm (11.5%, 3.3%) as compared to laser (5.6%, 0%). Nevertheless, overall, 
rates of non-ocular AEs were as expected for a preterm population with comorbidities. 
Regarding Additional safety assessments, cognitive status of patients as assessed by Mullen Scales of 
Early Learning was comparable across treatment arms both at the patient’s 2 years corrected age  and 
EMA/CHMP/956289/2022

at the 5th birthday visit and Laboratory data, vital signs, growth parameters, hearing and respiratory 
function, and duration of hospitalization all demonstrated comparable results between treatment arms 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall, it is agreed with the MAH that efficacy of intravitreal Lucentis (ranibizumab) 0.2 mg has been 
maintained and is numerically better than 0.1 mg ranibizumab and laser. 
The presented data did not reveal any new safety concern in ROP patients who showed a consistent 
long-term safety profile with no new safety signals observed.  
The benefit-risk balance of Lucentis 0.2 mg in the treatment of ROP in preterm infants remains 
positive.

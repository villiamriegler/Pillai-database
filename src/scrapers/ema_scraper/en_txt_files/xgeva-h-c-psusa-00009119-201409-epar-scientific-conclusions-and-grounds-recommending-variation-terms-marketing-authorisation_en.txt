Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for denosumab (indicated in 
fractures, bone neoplasm metastasis), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
With regards to the risk of Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ), it is recommended that the product 
information is revised to reflect the current knowledge on ONJ and to optimise risk minimisation. 
Changes to the product information include the addition of a contraindication to ensure that 
treatment is not initiated while there are any unhealed lesions in the mouth from dental or oral 
surgery.  
In addition, although the risk for ONJ may be well known for the prescribers, further awareness on 
such risk is needed for the patients. Thus, it is considered warranted to implement a patient 
reminder card as an additional risk minimisation measure for ONJ. The wording for the reminder 
card has been agreed by the PRAC.  
Therefore, in view of available data regarding denosumab (indicated in fractures, bone neoplasm 
metastasis), the PRAC considered that changes to the product information and conditions of the 
marketing authorisation were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for denosumab (indicated in fractures, bone neoplasm 
metastasis) the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product 
containing denosumab (indicated in fractures, bone neoplasm metastasis) is favourable subject to 
the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

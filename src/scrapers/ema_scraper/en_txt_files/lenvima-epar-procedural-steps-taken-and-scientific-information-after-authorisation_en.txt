SmPC and PL 
Based on the review of the interim results of the STELLAR 
M000-508 (STELLAR), listed as a category 3 PASS in 
the RMP. This is a non-interventional multicentre, 
observational, phase 4 study to evaluate the safety 
and tolerability of lenvatinib in patients with 
advanced or unresectable HCC. Update of section 4.8 
of the SmPC to include ‘gastrointestinal perforation’ 
study, the CHMP concluded that no new efficacy or safety 
concerns have been demonstrated for the approved 
indication of Lenvima in hepatocellular carcinoma. 
SmPC new text 
‘Gastrointestinal perforation’ has been added to section 4.8 
of the SmPC as an adverse drug reaction reported in 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

lenvatinib in children and adolescents with refractory 
or relapsed solid malignancies and young adults with 
osteosarcoma; Study E7080-G000-230 is a 
multicenter, open-label, randomized Phase 2 study 
to compare the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib in 
combination with ifosfamide and etoposide versus 
ifosfamide and etoposide in children, adolescents and 
young adults with Relapsed or Refractory 
Osteosarcoma (OLIE). The Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. The RMP version 15.1 has also 
been submitted.

The results from the final OS analysis of Study E7080-
the efficacy information of "Endometrial carcinoma" 
based on the final OS analysis data for the overall 
population as well as for MMR subgroups from study 
E7080-G000-309 / KEYNOTE-775. This is a 
Multicenter, Open-label, Randomized, Phase III study 
to compare the efficacy and safety of lenvatinib in 
combination with pembrolizumab versus treatment of 
physician’s choice in participants with advanced 
endometrial cancer. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to 
implement editorial changes in the SmPC. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance

G000-309/KEYNOTE-775, with additional 16 months of 
follow-up, are overall consistent with the data from the first 
interim analysis submitted to support the approval of the 
advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma indication, in 
the overall population as well as in pMMR and dMMR 
subsets. Improvement in OS in Lenvatinib plus 
pembrolizumab over TPC was consistently observed with 
the OS HR 0.65 (95% CI: 0.55, 0.77; nominal p<0.0001), 
with the median OS of 18.7 months versus 11.9 months, 
respectively.

In addition, pneumothorax has been reported with and 
without clear evidence of a bronchopleural fistula. Some 
reports of fistula and pneumothorax occurred in association 
with tumour regression or necrosis. Prior surgery and 
radiotherapy may be contributing risk factors. Lung 
metastases may also increase the risk of pneumothorax. 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC to 
amend the existing warnings on proteinuria and non-
gastro-intestianl fistula and to add pneumothorax 
and nephrotic syndrome as new adverse drug 
reactions (ADRs) with uncommon frequency. The PL 
is updated accordingly.

patients showed that plasma concentrations of midazolam 
(a sensitive CYP3A and Pgp substrate) were not altered in 
the presence of lenvatinib.  No significant drug-drug 
interaction is therefore expected between lenvatinib and 
other CYP3A4/Pgp substrates.

All subjects were managed using dose interruption as 
recommended in the protocol and there were no dose 
reductions or treatment discontinuations as a result of 
events of cholecystitis. During the clinical trials the overall 
frequency of cholecystitis including cholecystitis with 
gallstones was “common”, i.e., it occurred in between 
1/100 and 1/10 of the patients. The table 4 of the section 
4.8 of the SmPC is updated accordingly. 
Serious pancreatitis and pancreatitis related events (lipase 
increased and amylase increased) were observed in clinical 
trials and in post marketing experience in association with 
lenvatinib dosage, the majority being associated with the 
24 mg daily dose. All subjects were managed using dose 
interruption, dose reduction and discontinuations (0.3% of 
all subjects) as recommended in the protocol. During the 
clinical trials pancreatitis occurred at a frequency of 0.9% 
and high grade pancreatitis at a frequency of 0.7%.  Lipase 
and amylase elevations were reported at frequencies of 
3.8% and 2% respectively with high grade frequencies of 
2.1% and 1.1% respectively. Amylase and lipase elevations 
are frequently reported with Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors and 
may result from a class effect. The table 4 of section 4.8 of 
the SmPC is updated accordingly. No case of death has 
been linked to lenvatinib regimen.

marketing surveillance, serious and fatal carotid artery 
haemorrhages were seen more frequently in patients with 
anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (ATC) than in DTC or other 
tumour types. The degree of tumour invasion/infiltration of 
major blood vessels (e.g. carotid artery) should be 
considered because of the potential risk of severe 
haemorrhage associated with tumour shrinkage/necrosis 
following lenvatinib therapy.  Some cases of bleeding have 
occurred secondarily to tumour shrinkage and fistula 
formation, e.g. tracheo-oesophageal fistulae.  Cases of fatal 
intracranial haemorrhage have been reported in some 
patients with or without brain metastases. Bleeding in sites 
other than the brain (e.g. trachea, intra-abdominal, lung) 
has also been reported.  
In the case of bleeding, dose interruptions, adjustments, or 
discontinuation may be required (for more information, 
please refer to the SmPC). 
Patients may be at increased risk for the development of 
fistulae when treated with lenvatinib. Cases of fistula 
formation or enlargement that involve other areas of the 
body than stomach or intestines were observed in clinical 
trials and in post-marketing experience (e.g. tracheal, 
tracheo-oesophageal, oesophageal, cutaneous, female 
genital tract fistulae). Prior surgery and radiotherapy may 
be contributing risk factors. Lenvatinib should not be 
started in patients with fistula to avoid worsening and 
lenvatinib should be permanently discontinued in patients 
with oesophageal or tracheobronchial tract involvement and 
any Grade 4 fistula (see section 4.2); limited information is 
available on the use of dose interruption or reduction in 
management of other events, but worsening was observed 
in some cases and caution should be taken. Lenvatinib may

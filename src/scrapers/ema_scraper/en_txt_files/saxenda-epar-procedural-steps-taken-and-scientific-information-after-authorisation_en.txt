A 16-week double-blind, 36 week open-label study was 
from phase 3a clinical trial NN8022-4179, listed as 
part of PIP, to evaluate efficacy/safety of liraglutide 
in obese children with Prader-Willi Syndrome from 6 
up to 18 years.

conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Saxenda in 
paediatric patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome and obesity. 
The study included 32 patients between 12 to <18 years of 
age (part A) and 24 patients between 6 to <12 years of 
age (part B). Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive 
Saxenda or placebo. Patients with a body weight less than 
45 kg started dose escalation at a lower dose; 0.3 mg 
instead of 0.6 mg and were escalated to a maximum dose 
of 2.4 mg. The estimated treatment difference in mean BMI 
SDS at 16 weeks (part A: -0.20 vs -0.13, part B: -0.50 vs -
0.44) and 52 weeks (part A: -0.31 vs -0.17, part B: -0.73 
vs -0.67) were similar with Saxenda and placebo. No 
additional safety concerns were seen in the trial.

The primary objective of trials 4181 and 3967 was to 
in order to update the safety information based on 
the conclusions of the assessment of two PK Clinical 
trial reports (NN8022-3967 and NN8022-4181), 
previously submitted in accordance with Article 46 of

C.I.3.b - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL 
intended to implement the outcome of a procedure

assessment done under A 45/46 - Change(s) with 
new additional data submitted by the MAH 
investigate the safety and tolerability of liraglutide for 
weight management in the paediatric population with 
obesity. Pharmacokinetic properties were assessed in 
clinical pharmacology studies in the paediatric population 
with obesity aged 12 to 17 years (14 patients, body weight 
80-122 kg) and 7 to 11 years (16 patients, body weight 
45-87 kg) respectively. 
The data from these trials showed that the liraglutide 
exposure in adolescents (age 12-17 years), was similar to 
that in adults with obesity. Exposure associated with 3.0 
mg liraglutide was found to be comparable between 
children aged 7 to 11, adolescents and adult subjects, after 
correction for body weight. In addition, in children aged 7 
to 11 years and in adolescents, no unexpected safety and 
Page 6/11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
tolerability issues were found. 
However, currently available PD and PK results are too 
limited to draw conclusions on the efficacy of Saxenda in 
children. Therefore the benefit risk in children cannot yet 
be established.

status at screening and BMI at baseline (≥30 kg/m² or <30 
kg/m²). All 3,731 patients were randomised to 56 weeks of 
treatment and the 2,254 patients with pre-diabetes at 
screening were randomised to 160 weeks of treatment. 
Both treatment period were followed by a 12-week off 
drug/placebo observational follow-up period. Lifestyle 
intervention in the form of an energy-restricted diet and 
exercise counselling was background therapy for all 
patients. 
The 56 week part of trial 1 assessed body weight loss in all 
the 3,731 randomised patients (2,590 completers). In this 
part, 67.5% of randomised patients achieved ≥5% weight 
loss after 12 weeks. In the 160 weeks part of trial 1 the 
weight loss occurred mainly in the first year, and was 
sustained throughout 160 weeks. 
The 160 week part of trial 1 assessed time to onset of type 
2 diabetes in the 2,254 randomised patients with pre-
diabetes (1,128 completers). At week 160, while on 
treatment, 3% treated with Saxenda and 11% treated with 
placebo were diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The 
estimated time to onset of type 2 diabetes mellitus for 
patients treated with liraglutide 3.0 mg was 2.7 times 
longer (with a 95% confidence interval of [1.9, 3.9]), and 
the hazard ratio for risk of developing type 2 diabetes 
mellitus was 0.2 for liraglutide versus placebo.

SmPC 
Based on in vitro studies and two phase 1 clinical studies, 
to update drug-drug interaction information with 
CYP3A4 based on final results from study 
2136R2118; this is a Phase 1, open-label, 1-
sequence crossover, drug-drug interaction study to 
assess the effect of repeated doses of cefiderocol on 
no significant drug-drug interactions are anticipated 
between cefiderocol and substrates, inhibitors or inducers 
of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) or transporters. 
For more information, please refer to the Summary of 
Product Characteristics. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Cefiderocol induces CYP3A4 in vitro. Therefore, the 
metabolism of co-administered medicinal products that are 
substrates of CYP3A4 is expected to increase and lead to 
decreased systemic exposure of these medicinal products. 
If cefiderocol is administered together with substrates of 
CYP3A4, the patients should be monitored for decreased 
efficacy of the concomitant drug. The effect of systemic 
hormonal contraceptives may be reduced; thus it is 
recommended to use an additional contraceptive method 
during and until 28 days after treatment with cefiderocol. 
As the in vitro CYP3A4 induction by cefiderocol is PXR 
mediated, other PXR inducible proteins may also be 
induced, for example the CYP2C family and P-gp. The 
clinical relevance of this induction is unknown. As a 
consequence, if cefiderocol is administered together with 
substrates of the CYP2C family or P-gp, the patients should 
be monitored for decreased efficacy of the concomitant 
drug. 
Based on in vitro studies and one phase 1 clinical 
evaluation no significant drug-drug interactions are 
anticipated between cefiderocol and substrates or inhibitors 
of cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYPs) or transporters (see 
section 5.2), except for the above-mentioned induction of 
CYP3A4, CYP2C and P-gp.

2.3.2.  Clinical study 
BOOSTRIX-049, A phase IV, open-label, non-randomised, multi-centre 
study to assess the immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose of 
Infanrix hexa in healthy infants born to mothers vaccinated with Boostrix 
during pregnancy or immediately post-delivery. 
Description 
This was a phase IV, open-label, non-randomised, multi-centre, multi-country study with 2 parallel 
groups. The study was conducted to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of booster dose of 
Infanrix hexa in infants who previously completed their primary vaccination series in study BOOSTRIX-
048. 
The study was initiated on September 19th 2016 and completed on March 19th 2019. 
Methods 
Objectives 
1. Primary 
•  To assess the immunological response to Infanrix hexa in terms of seroprotection status for 
diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, poliovirus and Hib antigens, and in terms of booster response 
for the pertussis antigens, 1 month after the booster dose in infants born to mothers 
vaccinated with Boostrix during pregnancy or immediately post-delivery. 
2. Secondary 
•  To assess the persistence of antibodies to all vaccine antigens before the booster dose in 
infants born to mothers vaccinated with Boostrix during pregnancy or immediately post-
delivery. 
•  To assess the immunological response to Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 in terms of antibody 
concentrations or titres against all antigens, 1 month after the booster dose in infants born to 
mothers vaccinated with Boostrix during pregnancy or immediately post-delivery. 
•  To assess the immunological response to Infanrix hexa in terms of seropositivity rates against 
pertussis antigens, 1 month after the booster dose in infants born to mothers vaccinated with 
Boostrix during pregnancy or immediately post-delivery. 
•  To assess the safety and reactogenicity of Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 in terms of solicited 
and unsolicited adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). 
•  To assess the neurodevelopmental status of infants born to mothers vaccinated with Boostrix 
during pregnancy or immediately post-delivery, at 9 and 18 months of age. 
A seroprotected subject was a subject whose antibody concentration/titre was greater than or equal to 
the level defining clinical protection.  
The following seroprotection thresholds were applicable: 
✓  Anti-D antibody concentrations ≥ 0.1 IU/mL. 
✓  Anti-T antibody concentrations ≥ 0.1 IU/mL. 
✓  Anti-HBs antibody concentrations ≥ 10 mIU/mL.

Booster response to the pertussis toxin (PT), filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) and pertactin (PRN) 
antigens, was defined as: 
- 
- 
- 
for subjects with pre-vaccination antibody concentration below the assay cut-off, 
postvaccination antibody concentration ≥ 4 times the assay cut-off, 
for subjects with pre-vaccination antibody concentration between the assay cut-off and < 4 
times the assay cut-off, post-vaccination antibody concentration ≥ 4 times the pre-vaccination 
antibody concentration, and 
for subjects with pre-vaccination antibody concentration ≥ 4 times the assay cut-off, 
postvaccination antibody concentration ≥ 2 times the pre-vaccination antibody concentration. 
Study design  
This was a phase IV, open-label, non-randomised, multi-centre, multi-country study with 2 parallel 
groups (figure 1). 
All subjects received a booster dose of Infanrix hexa coadministered with Prevenar 13 between 11-18 
months of age according to the routine national/local immunisation schedule or as specified in the 
study procedure manual (SPM).

Blood samples were to be drawn from all subjects before the booster dose administration and one 
month after the booster dose. 
Data collection was done through an electronic case report form. 
An IDMC (Independent data monitoring committee) was established to oversee the safety aspects 
including neurodevelopmental status of infants born to mothers vaccinated with Boostrix during 
pregnancy or immediately post-delivery in this clinical study. 
The intended study duration was approximately 9-10 months, per subject.

A maximum of 680 infants aged 9 months were planned to be enrolled in the study to receive the 
booster dose of Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 at 11-18 months of age. 
Infants were divided in 2 groups in the study as follows: 
• 
dTpa Group: This group comprised infants, born to mothers belonging to the dTpa Group in 
BOOSTRIX-047 (i.e., mothers who had received a single dose of Boostrix during pregnancy and a 
dose of placebo immediately post-delivery). 
•  Control Group: This group comprised infants, born to mothers belonging to the Control Group in 
study BOOSTRIX-047 (i.e., mothers who had received a single dose of placebo during pregnancy 
and a dose of Boostrix immediately post-delivery). 
Treatments  
Formulation and characteristics of the study vaccine are presented in Table 2. The dosage and 
administration of study vaccine is given in Table 3.

Statistical Methods 
1.  Analysis of immunogenicity 
The primary analysis was based on the According-to-protocol (ATP) cohort for analysis of 
immunogenicity. As the percentage of enrolled subjects excluded from this ATP cohort was more than

5%, a second analysis based on the Total vaccinated cohort (TVC) was performed to complement the 
ATP analysis. All analyses were descriptive. 
For each group, at each time point that a blood sample result was available: 
•  Seropositivity rates against PT, FHA and PRN antigens and pneumococcal antigens (1, 3, 4, 5, 
6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, 23F) with exact 95% confidence interval (CI) were 
calculated. 
•  Seroprotection rates against diphtheria toxoid, tetanus toxoid, HBs, PRP antigen and poliovirus 
types 1, 2, 3 antigens (with exact 95% CI) were calculated. 
•  Percentage of subjects with anti-pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 
19A, 19F, 23F) antibody concentrations ≥0.35 μg/mL (invasive pneumococcal disease 
threshold of protection for electrochemiluminescence GSK assay) was calculated along with its 
exact 95% CI. 
•  Percentage of subjects with anti-D and anti-T antibody concentrations ≥ 1.0 IU/mL was 
calculated along with its exact 95% CI. 
•  Percentage of subjects with anti-PRP antibody concentrations ≥ 1.0 μg/mL and anti-HBs 
antibody concentrations ≥ 100 mIU/mL was calculated along with its exact 95% CI. 
•  Geometric mean concentration/titre with 95% CI was tabulated for antibodies against each 
antigen. 
•  The booster response rates to PT, FHA and PRN (with exact 95% CI) 1 month after the booster 
dose were calculated. 
The above summaries were also provided by primary vaccination schedule, by gestational age and age 
of the mother at dose 1 in the primary study. 
• 
The distribution of antibody concentrations/titres for each antigen was displayed using reverse 
cumulative distribution curves. 
• 
The immunogenicity analysis for the pertussis antigens was generated on the adapted ATP 
cohort taking in to account all the time points from 116945 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-047] up to the 
current study. 
2.  Analysis of safety 
The primary analysis was based on the TVC. All analyses were descriptive. 
• 
The percentage of subjects with at least 1 local AE (solicited or unsolicited), with at least 1 
general AE (solicited or unsolicited) and with any AE (solicited or unsolicited) during the 4-day 
(Days 0-3) follow-up period was tabulated with exact 95% CI. The same calculations were 
done for AEs (solicited or unsolicited) rated as grade 3 in intensity, for AEs (solicited or 
unsolicited) leading to medical advice and for AEs (solicited or unsolicited) assessed as causally 
related to vaccination. 
• 
The incidence of local AEs (solicited and unsolicited) was calculated at each injection site as 
well as overall (all sites considered) for each group. 
• 
The percentage of subjects reporting each individual solicited local and general AE during the 
4-day (Days 0-3) solicited follow-up period was tabulated after the vaccine dose, with exact 
95% CI. The same calculations were done for each individual solicited AE rated as grade 3 in 
intensity and for each individual solicited AE assessed as causally related to vaccination. The 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/496744/2020  
Page 11/29 
 
 
 
 
computations were also done for grade ≥2 (solicited AEs only) and grade 3 AEs, for AEs 
considered related to vaccination (general AEs only), for grade 3 AEs considered related to 
vaccination (general AEs only) and for AEs that resulted in a medically-attended visit. 
•  Occurrence of fever and related fever was reported per 0.5°C cumulative temperature 
increments as well as the occurrence of grade 3 fever (>39.0°C axillary temperature) with 
causal relationship to vaccination. 
• 
The verbatim reports of unsolicited AEs were reviewed by a physician and the signs and 
symptoms were coded according to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Authorities. Every 
verbatim term was matched with the appropriate Preferred Term. The percentage of subjects 
with unsolicited AEs occurring within 31-day (Days 0-30) follow-up period after any dose with 
its exact 95% CI was tabulated by group, and by preferred term. Similar tabulation was done 
for unsolicited AEs rated as grade 3, for unsolicited AEs with causal relationship to vaccination 
and AEs/SAEs leading to withdrawal from the study. 
• 
The percentage of subjects who received concomitant medication and antipyretic medication 
during the 4-day (Days 0-3) follow-up period and during the entire study period was tabulated 
(with exact 95% CI) after the booster dose. 
•  Any large injection site reaction (defined as any local swelling with diameter >50 mm and/or 
any noticeable diffuse injection site swelling [diameter not measurable] and/or any noticeable 
increased circumference of the injected limb) reported during the 4-day (Days 0-3) follow-up 
period after the booster dose was described in detail. 
•  Subjects who experienced at least 1 SAE from booster vaccination up to study end were 
described. 
•  Subjects who reported at least 1 SAE after the end of primary study 201330 [DTPA 
(BOOSTRIX)-048 PRI] and before 201334 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-049 BST: 048] study were 
described. 
•  Withdrawals due to AEs and SAEs following vaccinations were described in detail. 
•  Neurodevelopmental status of the subjects was assessed depending on the ASQ-3 score. The 
proportion of subjects in the black zone for any domain, for gross motor skills, fine motor 
skills, communication, problem solving skills and personal-social skills was tabulated. The 
proportion of infants referred for formal neurodevelopmental evaluation using BSID-III and 
those with at least 1 indicator of neurodevelopmental impairment using BSID-III was also 
tabulated. In order to account for subjects who withdrew from the study after Visit 1 (after 
completion of ASQ-3 questionnaire but had not received booster vaccination), the analysis was 
to be performed on the Total enrolled cohort. 
• 
The percentage of subjects with congenital anomalies reported across the 3 studies (116945 
[DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-047], 201330 [DTPA (BOOSTRIX)-048 PRI] and 201334 [DTPA 
(BOOSTRIX)-049 BST: 048) with its exact 95% CI was tabulated by group, and preferred term.

Assessor’s comment 
Methods are overall acceptable. 
Primary and secondary objectives and endpoints are relevant. The seroprotection thresholds proposed 
as associated with clinical protection against diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis,  
Haemophilus influenzae type b and Streptococcus pneumoniae infections are appropriate.  
The definition of booster response to pertussis antigens is acceptable. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 540 subjects were vaccinated, of which 4 subjects from the dTpa Group were withdrawn from 
the study (1 subject due to consent withdrawal and 3 subjects were lost to follow-up). Hence, 536 
subjects completed the study. 
For the ATP analysis, 6 subjects were excluded from safety analysis and further 55 subjects were 
excluded from immunogenicity analysis (Table 4). Therefore, 534 subjects comprised the ATP cohort 
for safety and 479 subjects comprised the ATP cohort for immunogenicity.

Assessor’s comment 
Similar proportion of subjects were withdrawn from the ATP cohort for safety and for immunogenicity 
in both groups. ATP cohort for safety consists of 99.3 and 98.6% of the TVC for dTpa and control 
groups, respectively. ATP cohort for immunogenicity consists of 87.1 and 90.3% of the TVC for dTpa 
and control groups, respectively. This is acceptable. 
Baseline data 
The demographic characteristics for the ATP cohort for immunogenicity is presented in Table 5. The 
demographic characteristics of the ATP cohort for immunogenicity were similar to the TVC.

Assessor’s comment 
Demographic characteristics are appropriately balanced between groups. 
Efficacy results 
1. Immune responses to Diphtheria and Tetanus toxoids (Table 6) 
•  Before the booster dose of Infanrix hexa, 81.2% and 90.2% of subjects were seroprotected 
against diphtheria respectively in dTpa group and control group (Secondary objective). The 
geometric mean concentration (GMC) value for anti-D was lower in dTpa group (0.207) when 
compared to control group (0.322). 
Similar proportion of subjects (96.4% and 95.1%) were seroprotected against tetanus 
respectively in dTpa group and control group (Secondary objective). No differences were 
observed in the GMCs between the 2 groups for anti-T. 
•  At 1 month after the booster dose of Infanrix hexa, the percentage of subjects seroprotected 
against diphtheria was 100% in both groups (Primary objective). Slightly lower anti-D GMC 
value was observed in the dTpa group (6.114) when compared to the control group (8.402).  
The percentage of subjects seroprotected against tetanus was 100% in both groups (Primary 
objective). There were no differences between the 2 groups in terms of anti-T GMCs. 
Table 6. Overall percentage of subjects with anti-D and anti-T antibody 
concentration above or equal to 0.1 IU/mL and 1.0 IU/mL and geometric mean 
concentrations, before and 1 month after the booster dose (ATP cohort for 
immunogenicity) 
Assessor’s comment 
As expected, the percentage of seroprotected (cut-off of 0.1 IU/ml) subjects against diphtheria before 
the boost was lower for dTpa group. Around 20%, instead of 10%, of the infants born from mothers 
vaccinated during pregnancy would be susceptible to diphtheria infection during a certain laps of time 
between post-primary and booster vaccination.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

All subjects were seroprotected against diphtheria and tetanus 1 month after the booster vaccination 
with Infanrix hexa, independently of the time of vaccination of the mother, maternal age and dose 
schedule of infant’s vaccination. Most of the dTpa and control subjects achieved the threshold of 1.0 
IU/ml associated with long term protection, even if lower anti-D GMC value was observed in the dTpa 
group. Conversely, a trend for a lower anti-T GMC value was observed in the control group compared 
to the dTpa group. These data suggest that the primary vaccination induced adequate immune 
memory in both group, i.e. independently of maternal immunisation (MI). 
2.  
Immune response to HBs antigen ( 
Table 7) 
•  Before the booster dose of Infanrix hexa, 94.1% and 94.2% of subjects were seroprotected 
against hepatitis B respectively in dTpa group and control group (Secondary objective). No 
differences were observed in the GMCs between the 2 groups for anti-HBs. 
•  At 1 month after the booster dose of Infanrix hexa, 99.5% and 99.2% of subjects were 
seroprotected against hepatitis B respectively in dTpa group and control group (Primary 
objective). There were no differences between the 2 groups in terms of anti-HBs GMCs. 
Table 7. Overall percentage of subjects with anti-HBs Ab concentration ≥10 mIU/ml, 
≥100 mIU/ml, and GMC, before and 1 month after the booster dose (ATP cohort for 
immunogenicity) 
Assessor’s comment 
Percentages of infants that were seroprotected (cut-off of 10 mIU/ml) against Hepatitis B before and 1 
month after the boost with Infanrix hexa were high, independent of the time of vaccination of the 
mother, the mother’s maternal age and the dose schedule of infant’s vaccination. Percentages of 
subjects mounting an Ab response ≥ 100 mIU/ml and GMT were similar between groups suggesting 
that maternal immunization does not interfere with the infant’s vaccine induced-protection against 
Hepatitis B.

3. 
Immune responses to poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 (Table 8) 
•  Before the booster dose of Infanrix hexa, 88.3-91.7% and 89.5-95.1% of subjects were 
seroprotected against poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 respectively in dTpa group and control group 
(Secondary objective). No differences were observed in the GMCs between the 2 groups for 
anti-poliovirus Ab. 
•  At 1 month after the booster dose of Infanrix hexa, 100% of subjects were seroprotected 
against poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 in both groups (Primary objective). There were no 
differences between the 2 groups in terms of anti-poliovirus GMCs.

immunogenicity) 
Assessor’s comment 
All the children were seroprotected (cut-off of 8 ED50) against poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3  one month 
after the booster dose with Infanrix hexa, independent of the time of vaccination of the mother, the 
mother’s maternal age and the dose schedule of infant’s primary vaccination. 
4.  Immune responses to Haemophilus influenzae type b PRP (Table 9) 
•  Before the booster dose of Infanrix hexa, 72.5% and 68.0% of subjects were seroprotected 
against Hib respectively in dTpa group and control group (Secondary objective). A trend for 
slightly lower anti-PRP GMC values were observed in the control group compared to the dTpa 
group. 
•  At 1 month after the booster dose of Infanrix hexa, 100% and 99.6% of subjects were 
seroprotected against Hib respectively in dTpa group and control group (Primary objective). A 
trend for lower anti-PRP GMC values were observed in the control group compared to the dTpa 
group.

for immunogenicity) 
Assessor’s comment 
Percentages of infants that were seroprotected (cut-off of 0.15 µg/ml) against Haemophilus influenzae 
type b 1 month after the booster dose with Infanrix hexa were high, independent of the time of 
vaccination of the mother, the mother’s maternal age and the dose schedule of infant’s primary 
vaccination. Most of the subjects of both groups achieved the Ab threshold associated with long-term 
protection (1.0 µg/ml). 
5.  Immune responses to Bordetella pertussis antigens (PT, FHA, PRN) (Table 10) 
•  Before  the  booster  dose  of  Infanrix  hexa,  68.6-96.4%  and  82.4-98.8%  of  subjects  were 
seropositive (antibody concentration ≥ assay cut-off) against pertussis antigens respectively in 
dTpa  group  and  control  group  (Secondary  objective).  The  GMCs  for  the  anti-pertussis 
antibodies were slightly lower in the dTpa group (anti-PT: 4.4; anti-FHA: 11.2; anti-PRN: 6.9) 
when compared to control group (anti-PT: 6.3; anti-FHA: 16.5; anti-PRN: 9.6). 
•  At  1  month  after  the  booster  dose  of  Infanrix  hexa,  the  booster  response  rates  against 
pertussis antigens was 92.1-98.1 % in dTpa group and 96.7-99.6 % in control group (Primary 
objective). All subjects in both groups were seropositive (antibody concentration ≥ assay cut-
off)  against  pertussis  antigens,  except  for  1  subject  in  the  dTpa  group  who  did  not  reach 
seropositive antibody level for anti-PT. 
•  Lower GMCs values were observed in the dTpa  group for anti-PT (52.4) and anti-FHA (152.5) 
when  compared  to  the  control  group  (anti-PT:  80.3;  anti-FHA:  187.2).  However,  lower  GMC 
value in the dTpa group compared to  the  control group was  not observed for anti-PRN  (dTpa 
group: 333.9; control group: 262.3). Large fold increases of the GMCs from the pre-booster to 
the 1-month after booster was observed in dTpa group (anti-PT: 11.9-fold, anti-FHA: 13.6-fold, 
anti-PRN: 48.4-fold), and this in similar ranges as observed in the control group (anti-PT: 12.7-
fold, anti-FHA: 11.3-fold, anti-PRN: 27.3-fold).

Assessor’s comment 
Since there is no correlate of protection (CoP) regarding the B. pertussis infection, it is considered that 
the most appropriate way to study a potential effect of maternal immunization (MI) on infant’s 
vaccination is to compare the GMC induced by the infant’s vaccination in the dTpa and in the control 
groups. Seropositive rates and booster responses were not considered. 
The concentrations of circulating Ab before the boost were comparable (only slightly lower values were 
observed in the control group compare to the dTpa group) between dTpa and control groups and in the 
same range than the titers observed in cord blood of infants born from non-vaccinated mothers.   
A blunting of the PT- and FHA- Ab responses are however still observed at 1 month post-boost. 95% CI 
were not overlapping. Conversely, anti-PRN titers were higher for the dTpa group when compared to 
the control group.  
Large fold increases of the GMCs from the pre-booster to the 1-month after booster was observed in 
both dTpa and control groups, suggesting that infants of both groups developed an immune memory 
against B. pertussis.  
Although the analysis is not powered to generate statistically significant results, it is to be noted that 
the difference of anti-PT and anti-FHA GMC values observed between the dTpa and the control groups 
was more pronounced for infants that received the study vaccines as a 2-dose schedule when 
compared to the infants that received the study vaccines as a 3-dose schedule. A difference in anti-
PRN GMC was also observed between 2-dose schedule dTpa and control groups (176.1 vs 233.4 
IU/ml).  
Nevertheless, in the absence of CoP, the observed blunting of the pertussis response is difficult to 
interpret in term of clinical relevance. 
6.  Immune responses to Prevenar 13 (Table 11) 
• 
Before the booster dose of Prevenar 13, 57.8-99.5% and 63.4-100% of subjects were 
seropositive against pneumococcal antigens respectively in dTpa group and control group. 
Slightly lower seroprotection rates for 2 serotypes (4 and 18C) were observed in dTpa group 
when compared to control group. No differences were observed in the GMCs between the 2 
groups for anti-pneumococcal Ab except for both serotypes 4 and 18C for which slightly lower 
GMCs were observed in dTpa group when compared to control group.

Assessor’s comment 
Lower Streptococcus pneumoniae immunogenicity at pre-booster timepoint was observed for serotypes 
4 (13.4 vs 27.2%) and 18C (19.9 vs 34.2%) in dTpa subjects as compared to the control group. 
Around twofold of the infants born from mothers vaccinated during pregnancy would therefore be 
susceptible to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection due to serotypes 4 and 18C during a certain 
(unknown) laps of time between post-primary and booster vaccination.

One month post-boost, similar proportion of infants achieved the threshold associated with protection 
(0.35 µg/ml) between groups, independently of the time of vaccination of the mother, the mother’s 
maternal age and the dose schedule of infant’s primary vaccination.  
GMCs were in general slightly lower for infants in dTpa group when compared to infants in control 
group but CI 95% were always overlapping.  
Safety results 
1.  During the 4-day follow-up period post-booster dose of Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13:

injection site reaction was reported for 2 subjects in the dTpa group and 3 subjects in the 
control group. 
o  Prevenar 13 injection site: Redness was the most frequent solicited local AE reported for 
46.7% and 48.2% of subjects in dTpa group and control group, respectively. A large 
injection site reaction was reported for 1 subject in the dTpa group and 1 subject in the 
control group. 
•  Grade 3 solicited local AE: 
o 
Infanrix hexa injection site: Redness was also the most frequent grade 3 solicited local AE 
reported for 8.2% and 8.7% of subjects in dTpa group and control group, respectively. 
o  Prevenar 13 injection site: Redness (5.4%) and pain (5.8%) were the most frequently 
reported grade 3 solicited local AE in dTpa group and in control group, respectively. 
•  Solicited general AE: Irritability was the most frequent solicited general AE reported for 63.2% 
and 68.4% of subjects in dTpa group and control group, respectively. 
•  Grade 3 solicited general AE: Irritability was also the most frequent solicited general grade 3 
AE reported for 5.0% and 10.2% of subjects in dTpa group and control group, respectively. 
2.  During the 31-day follow-up period post-booster dose of Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13: 
•  Unsolicited AEs: At least 1 unsolicited AE was reported for 35.7% and 40.1% of subjects in

•  Grade 3 causally related unsolicited AEs: There were no grade 3 causally related unsolicited 
AEs reported during the study period. 
•  Unsolicited AEs with medically attended visits: At least 1 unsolicited AE with medically attended 
visit was reported for 22.8% and 25.6% of subjects in dTpa group and control group, 
respectively. Of which, the most frequent AE reported was ear infection in both groups (3.4% 
in dTpa group and 4.0% in control group). 
3.  Throughout the study period: 
• 
SAEs: One case with fatal outcome was reported in the dTpa group before the administration of 
booster dose. Post-booster dose of Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13, 3 SAEs were reported in 3 
subjects in the control group and none were assessed by the investigator as causally related to 
the vaccination. There were no SAEs reported in the dTpa group. 
•  Withdrawals due to AEs/SAEs: In the dTpa group, the same subject with a fatal outcome was 
withdrawn from the study after Visit 1. This fatal case was not considered by the investigator 
as related to the primary vaccination received in BOOSTRIX-048 study and this case occurred 
before the booster dose administration in the current study. 
4.  Congenital Anomalies:  
During the 3 clinical studies, at least 1 congenital anomaly in infants was reported for 10.4% and 
12.9% of subjects in dTpa group and control group, respectively. Of which, atrial septal defect was 
the most frequent congenital anomaly reported in both groups (1.5% in dTpa group and 2.3% in 
control group). 
5.  Neurodevelopmental status: 
•  At 9 or 18 months of age, 11.5% and 11.0% of subjects in the dTpa group and the control 
group, respectively, reported a score in the black zone for at least 1 domain of ASQ-3. 
•  At 9 or 18 months of age, 4.61% and 5.84% of subjects in the dTpa group and the control 
group, respectively, had at least 1 indicator of neurodevelopmental delay. 
Assessor’s comment  
Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 were generally well tolerated. The safety profile of the Infanrix hexa 
and Prevenar 13 co-administration is acceptable and similar between groups. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The study BOOSTRIX-049 was a phase IV, open-label, non-randomised, multi-centre study to assess 
the immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose of Infanrix hexa in healthy infants born to mothers 
vaccinated with Boostrix during pregnancy or immediately post-delivery.  
The study is part of a clinical data generation plan consisting of 3 studies that document the maternal 
vaccination during the third trimester of pregnancy with Boostrix (BOOSTRIX-047), and the impact 
thereof on the response to the infant primary vaccination (BOOSTRIX-048) and toddler booster 
vaccination (BOOSTRIX-049).

Clinical protection against diphtheria, tetanus, hepatitis B, poliomyelitis, Haemophilus influenzae type b 
and Streptococcus pneumoniae infections were defined by their serological correlates of protection. 
The seroprotection thresholds were ≥0.1 IU/mL for anti-D and anti-T antibody (Ab) concentrations, 
≥10 mIU/mL for anti-HBs Ab concentrations, ≥8 ED50 for anti-poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3 Ab titres, 
≥0.15 μg/mL for anti-PRP Ab concentrations and ≥ 0.35 µg/mL for anti-PnPS Ab concentrations. 
The percentage of seroprotected subjects against diphtheria before the boost was lower for dTpa group 
(81.2%) when compare to the control group (90.2%). Similarly, lower Streptococcus pneumoniae 
immunogenicity at pre-booster timepoint was observed for serotypes 4 (13.4 vs 27.2%) and 18C (19.9 
vs 34.2%) in dTpa subjects as compared to the control group. Around twofold of the infants born from 
mothers vaccinated during pregnancy would therefore be susceptible to diphtheria and Streptococcus 
pneumoniae infection due to serotypes 4 and 18C during a certain (unknown) laps of time between 
post-primary and booster vaccination. Only few data are currently available in the literature. Lower 
anti-D (Maertens 2016, Zimmermann 2019) and lower anti-Pn specific to several serotypes, including 4 
and 18C, (Zimmermann 2019) were also observed before the booster dose in infants born from 
mothers vaccinated during pregnancy compared to infants whose mothers did not receive dTpa 
immunisation during pregnancy. Conversely, no difference in pre-boost anti-D titers were observed 
between similar groups in Munoz 2014. The MAH is invited to discuss the clinical and epidemiological 
relevance of these observations in the Variation II dossier that will be submitted in March 2020. 
Changes in the SmPC reflecting these observations would be needed, unless adequately justified by 
the MAH. 
At 1 month after the booster vaccination with Infanrix hexa, all subjects were seroprotected against 
diphtheria, tetanus, and poliovirus type 1, 2 and 3, >94% against hepatitis B, and >99% against 
Haemophilus influenzae type b infections, independently of the time of vaccination of the mother, 
maternal age and dose schedule of infant’s vaccination.   
In addition most the dTpa and control subjects achieved Ab thresholds associated with long term 
protection or robust immune responses against tetanus (1.0 IU/ml), hepatitis B (100 mIU/ml), and 
Haemophilus influenzae type b infections (1.0 µg/ml). For diphtheria, most of the subjects of both 
groups also achieved the threshold of 1.0 IU/ml, even if lower anti-D GMC value was observed in the 
dTpa group. Overall, these data suggest that the primary vaccination induced adequate immune 
memory in both group, i.e. independently of maternal immunisation (MI). 
A trend for lower GMCs of Ab specific to most of the serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae was 
observed for the dTpa group compared to the control group post-boost. However 95% CI were always 
overlapping and the percentages of subjects achieving the protective threshold of 0.35 µg/ml to the 
various serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F) of Streptococcus 
pneumoniae were generally high (ranging from 79 to 100%) and comparable between groups, 
suggesting that the subjects of both groups are comparatively able to mount an anamnestic response. 
Thus, the observed (slight) interference of MI on infant’s Ab concentration post-booster vaccination is 
not likely to be clinically relevant in the short term. 
One month post-boost, lower PT- and FHA- Ab responses were observed in infants whose mothers did 
receive dTpa immunisation during pregnancy when compare to control infants. 95% CI were not 
overlapping. Conversely, anti-PRN titers were higher for the dTpa group when compared to the control 
group. The observed results are in line with those found in the literature; Lower/trend for lower Ab 
responses to pertussis antigens were also observed post-boost in Hardy-Fairbanks 2013, Maertens 
2016a, Maertens 2016b, Halperin 2018. Nevertheless, comparable fold increases of the anti-pertussis 
antigens GMCs from the pre-booster to the 1-month after booster were observed in both dTpa and 
control groups, suggesting that infants of both groups developed an immune memory against B. 
pertussis. Yet, even if data of BOOSTRIX-049 study suggest that an immune memory was induced by

the vaccination, it is not known for which duration and if the quality of the recall responses would be 
unaffected. 
Although the analysis is not powered to generate statistically significant results, it is to be noted that 
the difference of anti-PT and anti-FHA GMC values observed between the dTpa and the control groups 
was more pronounced for infants that received the primary vaccination as a 2-dose schedule when 
compared to the infants that received the study vaccines as a 3-dose schedule. A difference in anti-
PRN GMC was also observed between 2-dose schedule dTpa and control groups (176.1 vs 233.4 
IU/ml).  
Nevertheless, in the absence of correlate of protection (CoP), the observed blunting of the pertussis 
response is difficult to interpret in term of clinical relevance and the ‘real’ (long-term) impact of MI for 
the infants. As already discussed in the BOOSTRIX-048 AR, the VWP considered that it could be 
appropriate to add a subsection in section 5.1 of the SmPC for Infanrix hexa under a heading of Infant 
immune responses following maternal immunisation (or similar). The section could shortly describe the 
observed effect on infant GMCs for pertussis antigens. 
Finally, both vaccines were generally well tolerated. The safety profile was similar whatever the time of 
mother’s vaccination (during or post-pregnancy). An update of the section 4.8 would be proposed by 
the MAH as part of a variation in March 2020. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
In the present study, infants born from mother either vaccinated during pregnancy (dTpa group) or 
post-delivery (control group) and having completed their primary vaccination with Infanrix hexa and 
Prevenar 13 (according to a 2- or 3-dose schedule) were boosted with Infanrix hexa and Prevenar 13 
around 15 months of age.  
Lower immunogenicity at pre-booster timepoint was observed for diphtheria and Streptococcus 
pneumoniae serotypes 4 and 18C in dTpa subjects as compared to the control group. The MAH is 
invited to discuss the clinical and epidemiological relevance of these observations in the Variation II 
dossier that will be submitted in March 2020. Changes in the SmPC reflecting these observations would 
be needed, unless adequately justified by the MAH. 
Immunogenicity results at post-boost timepoint demonstrated that maternal immunization (MI) does 
not interfere with vaccine-induced seroprotection against diphtheria, tetanus, Hepatitis B, poliovirus 
type 1, 2 and 3, Haemophilus influenzae type b and, Streptococcus pneumoniae. 
A slight blunting effect was however observed for diphtheria and Streptococcus pneumoniae induced-
immune responses (in terms of GMT). Nevertheless, 1 month after the booster dose, >99% of the 
subjects of dTpa group achieved the anti-D Ab threshold associated with long-term protection and 
comparable percentage of subjects had anti-PnPs Ab titers ≥ 0.35 µg/ml in both groups. It is thus 
unlikely that the observed interference is clinically relevant in the short term. 
Anamnestic responses to pertussis antigens were observed after the boost, suggesting that infants of 
both groups developed an immune memory against B. pertussis. It is however not known for which 
duration and if the quality of the recall responses would be unaffected. Indeed, in line with the 
literature, a blunting effect of the MI on infant vaccine-induced pertussis antibody responses was 
observed post-boost (in terms of GMT). In the absence of CoP, it is difficult to estimate the clinical 
relevance of this blunting of pertussis responses and the ‘real’ (long-term) impact of MI for the infants. 
As already discussed in the BOOSTRIX-048 assessment report, the VWP considered that it could be 
appropriate to add the results of the studies in section 5.1 of the SmPC for Infanrix hexa.

Both vaccines were generally well tolerated. The safety profile was similar whatever the time of 
mother’s vaccination (during or post-pregnancy). An update of the section 4.8 of the SmPC would also 
be proposed. 
The MAH committed to submit a variation in March 2020 in which the outcome of the three maternal 
vaccination studies dTpa-047, -048 and -049 will be discussed. An update of the product information 
will be proposed as part of this variation. 
  Fulfilled: 
In view of the available data from BOOSTRIX-049 and BOOSTRIX-048 (assessed as part of 
EMEA/H/C/000296/P46/131) and BOOSTRX-047 (not yet submitted but part of the same programme 
development), the MAH should either submit a variation in accordance with Articles 16 and 17 of

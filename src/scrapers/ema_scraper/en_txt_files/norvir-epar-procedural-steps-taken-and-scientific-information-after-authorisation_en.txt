Drug Interactions (DDIs) of ritonavir with direct oral 
anticoagulants (DOACs) dabigatran and edoxaban to align 
with recent updates to the Prezista (darunavir) label. This 
request resulted from the Norvir LEG 033-12, which is the 
commitment to "… update the product information annually 
with any relevant information on boosted protease 
inhibitors that may be approved in the future." 
Although in contrast to the situation for darunavir, no direct 
DDI data are available for ritonavir (and the combination of 
lopinavir and ritonavir) with dabigatran etexilate; from a 
mechanistic point of view, it is considered highly likely by 
the Committee that a comparable DDI between ritonavir 
(or lopinavir/ritonavir) with the P-gp substrates dabigatran 
etexilate and edoxaban will occur, leading to increased 
bioavailability of these DOACs. The Committee considers 
the above sufficiently supported by literature data (Testa S 
et al, 2020, publishing cases displaying such increased 
exposures). 
Ritonavir is also an active ingredient of Kaletra 
(lopinavir/ritonavir) and Aluvia (lopinavir/ritonavir).  
In this light, based on the above, sections 4.5 of the SmPCs 
of Norvir, Kaletra and Aluvia are updated to add the 
treatment recommendations for dabigatran exilate and 
edoxaban. The Package Leaflets (PL) are updated 
accordingly.

Product Characteristics.

A bibliographic and post-marketing data search showed 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of section 4.5 of the SmPC on the potential 
interaction with apalutamide, a moderate to strong 
CYP3A4 inducer, as well as with encorafenib, 
following an evaluation of the potential drug-drug 
interaction (DDI) between LPV/RTV (Kaletra and 
Aluvia) with apalutamide (Erleada) and encorafenib 
(Braftovi) through bibliographic and post-marketing 
data search. The Package Leaflet is also updated 
accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
that the concomitant use of lopinavir (LPV)/ritonavir (RTV) 
(Kaletra and Aluvia) or ritonavir (Norvir) with apalutamide 
and encorafenib is not recommended. This is due to the 
fact that LPV/RTV are both inhibitors of CYP3A and the co-
administration with apalutamide and encorafenib, both 
anticancer agents which are primarily metabolised by 
CYP3A, may result in increased plasma concentrations and 
lead to increased toxicity and potential risk for serious 
adverse events. 
Additionally, apalutamide, an inhibitor of androgen 
receptors indicated for the treatment of prostate cancer, is 
a strong inducer of CYP3A4. The co-administration of 
apalutamide with LPV is expected to decrease LPV exposure 
and potentially lead to virological failure and resistance 
emergence. Given the metabolic properties of LPV, RTV and 
apalutamide, and that these three compounds are 
metabolised through CYP3A, the net effect of LPV/RTV and 
apalutamide combination is unpredictable and hence, their 
co-administration is not recommended.  
Similarly, encorafenib, a kinase inhibitor indicated for the 
treatment of metastatic melanoma, is both an inhibitor and 
inducer of CYP3A4 and may also affect CYP3A4 substrates 
such as LPV/RTV. Given that its impact on LPV/RTV 
exposure is also unknown, its coadministration is not 
recommended.

Lopinavir and ritonavir are inhibitors of the P450 isoform 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of sections 4.3 and 4.5 of the SmPC in order 
to include information on the contraindication with 
neratinib and interactions with abemaciclib, neratinib 
and glecaprevir/pibrentasvir. In addition, the 
Worksharing applicant (WSA) took the opportunity to 
update section 4.5 of the SmPC of Kaletra and Aluvia 
to add information on the interaction of 
lopinavir/ritonavir with 
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/voxilaprevir, as well as to 
remove information on the interaction with 
boceprevir and telaprevir. Furthermore, the quantity 
of tenofovir disoproxil has been amended in sections 
4.5 and 5.1 of the Kaletra and Aluvia SmPCs (as 
requested during procedure WS 1555) as 300 mg 
tenofovir disoproxil fumarate is equivalent to 245 mg 
tenofovir disoproxil . The Package Leaflets are 
updated accordingly.

CYP3A in vitro. Co-administration with medicinal products 
primarily metabolised by CYP3A may result in increased 
plasma concentrations of the other medicinal product, 
which could increase or prolong its therapeutic and may 
increase the potential for serious and/or life threatening 
reactions. Therefore, concomitant use of ritonavir and 
lopinavir/ritonavir with neratinib and abemaciclib, are 
contraindicated. 
Furthermore, ritonavir and lopinavir are inhibitors of 
OATP1B1, P-glycoprotein and BCRP. Therefore, concomitant 
administration of ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir and 
glecaprevir/pibrentasvir is not recommended due to an 
increased risk of ALT elevations associated with increased 
glecaprevir exposure.  
Moreover, serum concentrations of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir 
and voxilaprevir may be increased due to P-glycoprotein, 
BCRP and OATP1B1/3 inhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir. 
Therefore, it is not recommended to co administer 
lopinavir/ritonavir and sofosbuvir/velpatasvir/ voxilaprevir 
due to a potential risk associated with increase in 
voxilaprevir exposure. 
Based on these potential drug-drug interactions, sections 
4.3 and 4.5 of the SmPC of the product information for 
ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir fixed-dose combination 
have been updated to provide further guidance for use in 
combination with these medical products.

increased due to CYP3A inhibition by lopinavir/ritonavir. Co-
administration of ibrutinib and ritonavir containing products 
may increase ibrutinib exposure which may increase the 
risk of toxicity including risk of tumor lysis syndrome. Co 
administration of ibrutinib and ritonavir containing products 
should be avoided.  If the benefit is considered to outweigh 
the risk and ritonavir containing products must be used, 
reduce the ibrutinib dose to 140 mg and monitor patient 
closely for toxicity. 
Post marketing cases have been reported indicating a 
potential interaction between ritonavir containing products 
and levothyroxine. Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 
should be monitored in patients treated with levothyroxine 
at least the first month after starting and/or ending 
lopinavir/ritonavir treatment.

proposed to add information on the drug-drug interaction 
between ritonavir and simeprevir in the Norvir SmPC 
section 4.5 and more specifically that ritonavir increases 
plasma concentrations of simeprevir as a result of CYP3A4 
inhibition; it is not recommended to co-administer ritonavir 
with simeprevir. The CHMP agreed with this proposal and 
noted it was in line with the information already approved 
in the Olysio SmPC. 
The addition of information of the DDI between ritonavir 
and simeprevir in the Norvir SmPC does not affect the 
benefit/risk balance of Norvir.

with ritonavir 600 mg BID demonstrating the major 
involvement of CYP3A in its metabolism. Based on the 
study results, the use of avanafil in combination with 
ritonavir was added as a contra-indication. Revisions on 
vardenafil were introduced, in line with the 
lopinavir/ritonavir SmPC. 
Drug-drug interaction with quetiapine resulting in deep

Although a direct causal relation between IRIS and 
autoimmune disorders might be possible, there are many 
other risk factors to take into consideration that may 
contribute to the pathogenesis of these diseases. There is 
further evidence available supporting the occurrence of 
Graves’ Disease following HAART therapy in HIV infected 
patients, because of nucleotide and amino acid homology 
between a unique region of the human thyrotropin receptor 
and the HIV-1 nef protein with demonstrated immune 
cross-reactivity between these two proteins.  Although 
critical data comparing treated and untreated patients is 
currently not available, patients with severe 
immunodeficiency at commencing HAART therapy appear to 
be at increased risk. There are no data available showing 
an increased risk with a particular HAART regimen. The 
incidence of these autoimmune diseases is rare but it 
warrants the revision of relevant sections of the Product 
Information.

Norvir and medicinal products primarily metabolised by 
CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of the 
other medicinal product, which could increase or prolong its 
therapeutic and adverse effects. Ritonavir also has a high 
affinity for P-glycoprotein and may inhibit this transporter. 
The inhibitory effect of ritonavir (with or without other 
protease inhibitors) on P-gp activity may decrease over 
time. Ritonavir may induce glucuronidation and oxidation 
by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 thereby 
increasing the biotransformation of some medicinal 
products metabolised by these pathways, and may result in

decreased systemic exposure to such medicinal products, 
which could decease or shorten their therapeutic effect. 
Pharmacokinetics data of the following medicinal products 
raltegravir and rivaroxaban were evaluated when these 
were co-administered with ritonavir. These data did not 
affect the risk/benefit of Norvir which still remains positive, 
but warranted the update of the relevant sections of the 
Norvir Product Information to introduce information on the 
drug-drug interactions evaluated. 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) of 
Norvir oral solution to add toxicity in neonates based

Characteristics and Package Leaflet. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
(19.3 hours), neonates may be at increased risk of 
propylene glycol-associated adverse events due to their 
diminished ability to metabolize propylene glycol, thereby 
leading to accumulation and potential adverse events and 
toxicity. 
Ritonavir oral solution concentrations of alcohol are 
approximately 43% (v/v) of alcohol (or 369.7 mg alcohol 
per mL) and 26.0% v/v of propylene glycol (or 265.7 mg 
propylene glycol per mL).  
Therefore, the CHMP recommended updating the Norvir 
oral solution Product Infromation to include this information 
and to inform the prescribing health care professional about 
the potential toxicity that may result from the high 
concentrations of these excipients when used in infants, 
particularly for neonates. 
The CHMP considered that the risk/benefit of Norvir oral 
solution is not adversely affected by the results of this 
review and the subsequent proposed revisions to the

An interaction study between ritonavir and sildenafil 
include a contraindication for sildenafil (in patients 
treated for pulmonary arterial hypertension) and to 
include a warning for the co-administration of 
salmeterol based on data available in the public 
domain. The PL was updated in accordance. In 
addition, the MAH took this opportunity to correct a 
typographical error in section 4.2 of the SPC to 
remove an incorrect reference to lopinavir and 
update the reference to pneumocystis carinii 
pneumonia in section 4.4 to pneumocystis jiroveci 
pneumonia to reflect the new name. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
showed that this co-administration leads to marked 
increases in sildenafil blood levels. Given this 
pharmacokinetic interaction and resulting increased 
potential for sildenafil-associated adverse events (which 
include hypotension and syncope), and the inability to 
further downward adjust the sildenafil dose below 20 mg in 
the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension patients, 
this co-administration of sildenafil with ritonavir was 
contraindicated. In addition, extrapolation of data from an 
interaction study between salmeterol and ketoconazole to 
ritonavir allows the conclusion that the co-administration of 
salmeterol and ritonavir is not recommended, as this could 
lead to higher than normal blood levels of salmeterol. Such 
elevation could lead to an increase in beta-agonist-
mediated systemic effects, i.e. cardiovascular side effects, 
which should be avoided.

opportunity to update sections 4.3 and 4.5 of the 
SPC and replace the term meperidine with pethidine 
and replace the term normeperidine with 
norpethidine. Consequently, the PL has been 
updated. In addition, the MAH took this opportunity 
to correct a typographical error in section 4.2 of the 
SPC and as well as to update the address of the local 
representative in Denmark in section 6 of the PL. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
4.4 of the Norvir SPC was updated in order to modify the 
statement for the co-administration of low-dose ritonavir 
with atazanavir. As a rule, ritonavir doses above 100mg 
have not been clinically evaluated and should therefore be 
avoided. However, based on data from an interaction study 
of atazanavir/ritonavir with the non-nucleoside reverse-
transcriptase inhibitor efavirenz, this statement was 
modified to allow a ritonavir dosage increase to 200mg in 
this co-administration, under close clinical monitoring. 
Furthermore, the CHMP agreed to the other proposed minor 
updates.

to induce QTc interval and PR interval prolongation at doses 
(administered over 3 days) chosen to provide maximal

concluded that ritonavir has a potential to induce modest 
QTc and PR interval prolongation. No study participant 
experienced an increase in QTcF of > 60 msec from 
baseline or a QTcF interval exceeding the potentially 
clinically relevant threshold of 500 msec.  The mean 
changes from baseline in PR interval ranged from 11.0 to 
24.0 msec in the 12 hour interval post dose. Maximum PR 
interval was 252 msec and no second or third degree heart 
block was observed. The Product Information was updated

isoforms (CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP2C19) and

A study evaluating the steady state pharmacokinetics of 
rosuvastatin alone (20 mg QD), LPV/r alone (400/100 mg 
BID) and rosuvastatin co-administered with LPV/r in 15 
healthy volunteers showed that co-administration of 
rosuvastatin and LPV/r resulted in 2.1- and 4.7-fold 
increase in rosuvastatin AUC and Cmax, respectively. No 
changes in LPV/r pharmacokinetics were observed with co-
administration of rosuvastatin. Although the exact 
mechanism of this interaction is unknown, it may be 
mediated by a transporter inhibition mechanism by 
ritonavir. Therefore, a drug interaction with rosuvastatin 
and ritonavir cannot be ruled out.

A review of available literature describing the interaction of 
available in the public domain on the interaction of 
buprenorphine and ritonavir in line with a CHMP 
request in April 2007 following a CHMP review of 
data on interactions with buprenorphine. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
ritonavir with buprenorphine in vitro and in vivo showed 
that the administration of ritonavir increased the AUC of 
buprenorphine by 57% due to an approximately 40% 
decrease in oral clearance. The increases of plasma levels 
of buprenorphine and its active metabolite did not lead to 
clinically significant pharmacodynamic changes in a 
population of opioid tolerant patients. Adjustment to the 
dose of buprenorphine may therefore not be necessary 
when the two are dosed together. In addition, the ritonavir 
plasma levels are not expected to change during this co-
administration. When ritonavir is used in combination with 
another protease inhibitor (as a "booster") and 
buprenorphine, the SPC of the co-administered protease 
inhibitor should be taken into consideration for specific 
dosing information.

reduced levels of ritonavir were observed. However, due to 
the auto-induction effect of ritonavir it could not be 
concluded that this effect was due to induction by 
rifampicin. The SPC was revised to reflect that although 
rifampicin may induce metabolism of ritonavir, limited data 
indicate that when high doses of ritonavir (600 mg twice 
daily) is co-administered with rifampicin, the additional 
inducing effect of rifampicin (next to that of ritonavir itself) 
is small and may have no clinical relevant effect on

concentrations of midazolam are expected to be 
significantly higher when midazolam is given orally than 
when it is injected. Therefore, the coadministration of 
Norvir with orally administered midazolam is 
contraindicated, whereas caution should be used when 
Norvir is co-administrated with injection of midazolam.  
If Norvir is co-administered with injectable midazolam, it 
should be done in an intensive care unit (ICU) or similar 
setting which ensures close clinical monitoring and 
appropriate medical management in case of respiratory 
depression and/or prolonged sedation. Dosage adjustment 
for midazolam should be considered, especially if more 
than a single dose of midazolam is administered. Sections

confirmed that there was no accumulation of ritonavir in 
the elderly aged between 50-70 years in these studies. The 
data are limited, but this may be expected for a HIV-
infected population. Age effects are mainly observed for 
renally cleared medicinal products, which is not applicable

ritonavir are reported to cause Liver Function Test (LFT) 
elevations in healthy subjects and patients. Based on 
available data, it is not clear whether the interaction 
between saquinavir boosted with ritonavir given 
concomitantly with rifampicin is pharmacokinetic or 
pharmacodynamic. However, it was agreed that a warning 
should be included in the SPC that the risk of hepatotoxicity 
may be higher in patients using saquinavir boosted with 
ritonavir when co-administered with rifampicin. Sections 
4.4 and 4.5 of the SPC were updated accordingly. 
Alfuzosin is indicated for treatment of functional symptoms 
of benign prostatic hypertrophia, by reducing urethral tone 
and bladder outlet resistance, and facilitating bladder 
emptying. At high doses, central effects like hypotension 
and orthostatic hypotension can occur. Because ritonavir is 
a potent inhibitor of the CYP3A4 hepatic enzyme 
responsible for alfuzosin metabolism, co-administration of 
ritonavir and alfuzosin may cause significant increases in 
alfuzosin exposure and the risk for serious adverse 
reactions, such as hypotension. The combination was 
therefore contra-indicated. Sections 4.3 and 4.5 of the SPC 
as well as section 2 of the PL were amended in accordance.

fluticasone concentrations were below the limit of 
quantification of the fluticasone assay in most subjects 
(61%) when fluticasone was administered for 7 days alone; 
additionally, plasma cortisol concentrations over 24 h were 
not significantly affected from baseline. When fluticasone 
concentrations were detectable (n=7), geometric mean 
Cmax was 11.9 pg/ml (range 11.0 to 13.0) and geometric 
mean AUC24 was equal to 8.43 pg.h/ml (range from 3.15 
to 22.6 pg·h/ml). After 7 days of ritonavir co-administration 
(n=11), fluticasone mean Cmax was 318 pg/ml (range 224 
to 451 pg/ml) and AUC24 was 3103 pg·h/ml (range 2252 
to 4275 pg·h/ml). These significant increases in fluticasone 
exposure resulted in a corresponding decrease in cortisol 
plasma exposure [86% decrease [90% CI of 82 to 89%] in 
cortisol AUC24].  
Immune reactivation syndrome 
In patients treated with any type of combination 
antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory response to 
indolent or residual opportunistic infections may occur, 
when the immune system responds to treatment. 
In most cases, the inflammatory reactions towards the 
opportunistic pathogens in question cannot be foreseen 
since the opportunistic infection has not been detected/ 
diagnosed. If diagnosed prior to institution of CART, the 
treatment against the opportunistic infection (OI) is usually 
given priority. In particular, this is true for the 
complications most feared in this context; CMV-retinitis, 
generalised mycobacterial infections and Pneumocystis 
carinii pneumonia. An additional reason for treating the OI

Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CRS and/or immune effector cell-associated 
neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) following epcoritamab administration. Patients should be hospitalised 
for 24 hours after administration of the Cycle 1 Day 15 dose of 48 mg to monitor for signs and 
symptoms of CRS and/or ICANS. Patients should be counselled on the signs and symptoms associated 
with CRS and ICANS and on seeking immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms occur at 
any time (see section 4.4).
Dose modifications and management of adverse reactions 
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)
Patients treated with epcoritamab may develop CRS.
Evaluate for and treat other causes of fever, hypoxia, and hypotension. If CRS is suspected, manage 
according to the recommendations in Table 3. Patients who experience CRS should be monitored more 
frequently during next scheduled epcoritamab administration.

A re-priming Cycle (identical to Cycle 1 with standard CRS prophylaxis) is required: 



If there are more than 8 days between the priming dose (0.16 mg) and intermediate dose 
(0.8 mg), or
If there are more than 14 days between the intermediate dose (0.8 mg) and first full dose 
(48 mg), or
If there are more than 6 weeks between full doses (48 mg) 
After the re-priming cycle, the patient should resume treatment with Day 1 of the next planned 
treatment cycle (subsequent to the cycle during which the dose was delayed).
Special populations
Renal impairment
Dose adjustments are not considered necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. 
Epcoritamab has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment to end stage renal disease.
No dose recommendations can be made for patients with severe renal impairment to end-stage renal 
disease (see section 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
Dose adjustments are not considered necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment. Epcoritamab 
has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (defined as total bilirubin > 3 times 
ULN and any AST) and data are limited in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (defined as total 
bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST). No dose recommendations can be made for patients with 
moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Elderly
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients ≥ 65 years of age (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).
Paediatric population
8
The safety and efficacy of Tepkinly in children aged less than 18 years of age have not yet been 
established. No data are available.
Method of administration
Tepkinly is for subcutaneous use. It should be administered by subcutaneous injection only, preferably 
in the lower part of the abdomen or the thigh. Change of injection site from left to right side or vice 
versa is recommended especially during the weekly administration schedule (i.e., Cycles 1-3).
For instructions on dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of 
the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)
CRS, which may be life-threatening or fatal, occurred in patients receiving epcoritamab. The most 
common signs and symptoms of CRS include pyrexia, hypotension and hypoxia. Other signs and 
symptoms of CRS in more than two patients include chills, tachycardia, headache and dyspnoea.
Most CRS events occurred in Cycle 1 and were associated with the first full dose of epcoritamab. 
Administer prophylactic corticosteroids to mitigate the risk of CRS (see section 4.2).
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CRS following epcoritamab administration. 
Patients should be hospitalised for 24 hours after administration of the Cycle 1 Day 15 dose of 48 mg to 
monitor for signs and symptoms of CRS. At the first signs or symptoms of CRS, treatment should be 
instituted of supportive care with tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids as appropriate (see section 4.2, 
Table 3). Patients should be counselled on the signs and symptoms associated with CRS and patients 
should be instructed to contact their healthcare professional and seek immediate medical attention 
should signs or symptoms occur at any time. Management of CRS may require either temporary delay
or discontinuation of epcoritamab based on the severity of CRS (see section 4.2).
Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS)
ICANS, including a fatal event, have occurred in patients receiving epcoritamab. ICANS may manifest 
as aphasia, altered level of consciousness, impairment of cognitive skills, motor weakness, seizures, and 
cerebral oedema.
The majority of cases of ICANS occurred within Cycle 1 of epcoritamab treatment, however some 
occurred with delayed onset. 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of ICANS following epcoritamab administration.
Patients should be hospitalised for 24 hours after administration of the Cycle 1 Day 15 dose of 48 mg to 
monitor for signs and symptoms of ICANS. At the first signs or symptoms of ICANS, treatment with 
corticosteroids and non-sedating-anti-seizure medicinal products should be instituted as appropriate (see 
section 4.2). Patients should be counselled on the signs and symptoms of ICANS and that the onset of 
events may be delayed. Patients should be instructed to contact their healthcare professional and seek 
9
immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms occur at any time. Epcoritamab should be 
delayed or discontinued as recommended (see section 4.2).
Serious infections
Treatment with epcoritamab may lead to an increased risk of infections. Serious or fatal infections were 
observed in patients treated with epcoritamab in clinical studies (see section 4.8). 
Administration of epcoritamab should be avoided in patients with clinically significant active systemic 
infections.
As appropriate, prophylactic antimicrobials should be administered prior to and during treatment with 
epcoritamab (see section 4.2). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection, before 
and after epcoritamab administration, and treated appropriately. In the event of febrile neutropenia, 
patients should be evaluated for infection and managed with antibiotics, fluids and other supportive 
care, according to local guidelines.
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS)
TLS has been reported in patients receiving epcoritamab (see section 4.8). Patients at an increased risk 
for TLS are recommended to receive hydration and prophylactic treatment with a uric acid lowering 
agent. Patients should be monitored for signs or symptoms of TLS, especially patients with high tumour 
burden or rapidly proliferative tumours, and patients with reduced renal function. Patients should be 
monitored for blood chemistries and abnormalities should be managed promptly.
Tumour flare
Tumour flare has been reported in patients treated with epcoritamab (see section 4.8). Manifestations 
could include localised pain and swelling. Consistent with the mechanism of action of epcoritamab, 
tumour flare is likely due to the influx of T-cells into tumour sites following epcoritamab 
administration. 
There are no specific risk factors for tumour flare that have been identified; however, there is a 
heightened risk of compromise and morbidity due to mass effect secondary to tumour flare in patients 
with bulky tumours located in close proximity to airways and/or a vital organ. Patients treated with 
epcoritamab should be monitored and evaluated for tumour flare at critical anatomical sites.
CD20-negative disease 
There are limited data available on patients with CD20-negative DLBCL treated with Tepkinly, and it is 
possible that patients with CD20-negative DLBCL may have less benefit compared to patients with 
CD20-positive DLBCL. The potential risks and benefits associated with treatment of patients with 
CD20-negative DLBCL with Tepkinly should be considered.
Patient card
The doctor must inform the patient of the risk of CRS and ICANS and any signs and symptoms of CRS
and ICANS. Patients must be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they experience signs 
and symptoms of CRS and/or ICANS. Patients should be provided with a patient card and instructed to 
carry the card at all times. This card describes symptoms of CRS and ICANS which, if experienced, 
should prompt the patient to seek immediate medical attention.
Immunisation
Live and/or live-attenuated vaccines should not be given during epcoritamab therapy. Studies have not 
been conducted in patients who received live vaccines.
10
Excipients with known effect
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.
This medicinal product contains 21.9 mg of sorbitol per vial, which is equivalent to 27.33 mg/ml.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed.
Transient elevation of certain proinflammatory cytokines by epcoritamab may suppress CYP450 
enzyme activities. On initiation of epcoritamab therapy in patients being treated with CYP450 substrates 
with a narrow therapeutic index, therapeutic monitoring should be considered.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in females
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment with
epcoritamab and for at least 4 months after the last dose. Verify pregnancy status in females of 
reproductive potential prior to initiating epcoritamab treatment.
Pregnancy
Based on its mechanism of action, epcoritamab may cause foetal harm, including B-cell 
lymphocytopenia and alterations in normal immune responses, when administered to pregnant women. 
There are no data on the use of epcoritamab in pregnant women. Animal reproduction studies have not 
been conducted with epcoritamab. IgG1 antibodies, such as epcoritamab, can cross the placenta 
resulting in foetal exposure. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a foetus.
Epcoritamab is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception.
Breast-feeding
It is not known whether epcoritamab is excreted in human milk or its effect on milk production. Since 
IgGs are known to be present in milk, neonatal exposure to epcoritamab may occur via lactational 
transfer. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with epcoritamab and for at 
least4 months after the last dose.
Fertility
No fertility studies have been conducted with epcoritamab (see section 5.3). The effect of epcoritamab
on male and female fertility is unknown.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Epcoritamab has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Due to the potential for 
ICANS, patients should be advised to exercise caution while (or avoid if symptomatic) driving, cycling
or using heavy or potentially dangerous machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
11
The safety of epcoritamab was evaluated in a non-randomised, single-arm study in 167 patients with 
relapsed or refractory LBCL after two or more lines of systemic therapy and included all the patients 
who enrolled to the 48 mg dose and received at least one dose of epcoritamab.
The median duration of exposure to epcoritamab was 3.7 months (range: 0 to 25 months).
The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) were CRS, fatigue, neutropenia, injection site reactions, 
musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, pyrexia, nausea and diarrhoea.
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 52% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reaction
(≥ 10%) was cytokine release syndrome (31%). Seven patients (4.2%) experienced a fatal adverse 
reaction (pneumonia in 3 (1.8%) patients, viral infection in 3 (1.8%) patients, and ICANS in 1 (0.6%) 
patient).
Adverse reactions that led to discontinuation occurred in 6.6% of patients. Discontinuation of 
epcoritamab due to pneumonia occurred in 6 (3.6%) patients, viral infection in 3 (1.8%) patients, and 
CRS, ICANS, or fatigue in 1 (0.6%) patient each.
Dose delays due to adverse reactions occurred in 32% of patients. Adverse reactions leading to dose 
delays (≥ 3%) were viral infections (9.6%), CRS (7.2%), neutropenia (4.8%), pyrexia (3.0%), and 
thrombocytopenia (3.0%).
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
Adverse reactions for epcoritamab from clinical studies (Table 6) are listed by MedDRA system organ 
class and are based on the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); 
uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000); and very rare (< 1/10 000).
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions
Cytokine release syndrome
CRS of any grade occurred in 51% (85/167) of patients treated with epcoritamab. The incidence of 
Grade 1 was 31%, Grade 2 was 17%, and Grade 3 occurred in 3.0% of patients. Recurrent CRS
occurred in 17% of patients. CRS of any grade occurred in 6.6% of patients after the priming dose 
(Cycle 1 Day 1); 13% after the intermediate dose (Cycle 1, Day 8); 44% after the first full dose (Cycle 
1, Day 15), 4.6% after the second full dose (Cycle 1 Day 22) and 2.8% after the third full dose (Cycle 2 
Day 1) or beyond. The median time to onset of CRS from the most recent administered epcoritamab 
dose was 2 days (range: 1 to 11 days). The median time to onset after the first full dose was 20.2 hours 
(range: 0.2 to 7 days). CRS resolved in 100% of patients, and the median duration of CRS events was 
2 days (range 0.1 to 27 days).
Of the 85 patients that experienced CRS, the most common signs and symptoms of CRS included 
pyrexia 99%, hypotension 31% and hypoxia 19%. Other signs and symptoms of CRS in greater than 
two patients included chills (11%), tachycardia (including sinus tachycardia (9%)), dyspnoea (3.5%), 
and headache (3.5%). Transient elevated liver enzymes (ALT or AST > 3xULN) were concurrent with 
CRS in 2.4% of patients with CRS. See section 4.2 and 4.4 for monitoring and management guidance. 
Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome
14
ICANS occurred in 6.0% of patients treated with epcoritamab; 4.2% experienced Grade 1 and 1.2% 
experienced Grade 2. One patient (0.6%) experienced an ICANS event of Grade 5 (fatal). The median 
time to first ICANS onset from the start of epcoritamab treatment (Cycle 1 Day 1) was 16.5 days 
(range: 8 to 141 days). ICANS resolved in 90% (9/10) of patients with supportive care. The median 
time to resolution of ICANS was 5 days (range: 1 to 9 days). In the 10 patients with ICANS, the onset 
of ICANS was prior to CRS in 20% of patients, concurrent with CRS in 40%, following onset of CRS 
in 10%, and in the absence of CRS in 30%.
Serious infections
Serious infections of any grade occurred in 25% of patients treated with epcoritamab. The most frequent 
serious infections included COVID-19 (6.6%), COVID-19 pneumonia (4.2%), pneumonia (3.6%), 
sepsis (2.4%), upper respiratory tract infection (1.8%), bacteraemia (1.2%), and septic shock (1.2%).
The median time to onset of first serious infection from the start of epcoritamab treatment (Cycle 1 Day 
1) was 56 days (range: 4 to 631 days), with median duration of 15 days (range: 4 to 125 days). Grade 5 
events of infections occurred in 7 (4.2%) patients.
Neutropenia
Neutropenia of any grade occurred in 31% of patients, including 23% Grade 3-4 events. The median 
time to onset of first neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased event was 65 days (range: 1 to 750 days), 
with median duration of 15 days (range: 2 to 155 days). Of the 51 patients who had 
neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased events, 51% received G-CSF to treat the events.
Tumour lysis syndrome 
TLS occurred in 1.8% of patients. There was one patient who experienced onset on Day 14 with
resolution on Day 17. Two additional patients experienced onset on Day 8 and Day 33 and both events 
were ongoing at the time of death; the deaths were due to disease progression. 
Tumour flare 
Tumour flare occurred in 3.0% of patients, all of which were grade 2. The median time to onset was 
17 days (range 9 to 34 days), and median duration was 15.5 days (range 1 to 50 days).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: not yet 
assigned
Mechanism of action
Epcoritamab is a humanised IgG1-bispecific antibody that binds to a specific extracellular epitope of 
CD20 on B cells and to CD3 on T cells. The activity of epcoritamab is dependent upon simultaneous 
engagement of CD20-expressing cancer cells and CD3-expressing endogenous T cells by epcoritamab 
that induces specific T-cell activation and T-cell-mediated killing of CD20-expressing cells.
15
Epcoritamab Fc region is silenced to prevent target-independent immune effector mechanisms, such as 
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (CDC), 
and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). 
Pharmacodynamic effects
Epcoritamab induced rapid and sustained depletion of circulating B-cells (defined as CD19 B-cell 
counts < 10 cell/µl in the subjects who have detectable B cells at treatment initiation). There were 21%
subjects (n=33) who had detectable circulating B-cells at treatment initiation. Transient reduction in 
circulating T cells was observed immediately after each dose in Cycle 1 and followed by T cell 
expansion in subsequent cycles.
Following subcutaneous administration of epcoritamab, transient and modest elevations of circulating 
levels of selected cytokines (IFN-γ, TNFα, IL-6, IL-2, and IL-10) occurred mostly after the first full 
dose (48 mg), with peak levels between 1 to 4 days post dose. Cytokine levels returned to baseline prior 
to the next full dose, however elevations of cytokines could also be observed after Cycle 1.
Immunogenicity
Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were commonly detected. The incidence of treatment-emergent ADAs at 
the approved 48 mg dosing regimen in the target DLBCL population was 2.9% (2.9% positive, 2.9% 
indeterminate and 94.3% negative, N=140 evaluable patients) and 2.6% (2.6% positive, 2.6% 
indeterminate and 94.9% negative, N= 39 evaluable patients), in studies GCT3013-01 and GCT3013-
04, respectively. No evidence of ADA impact on pharmacokinetics, efficacy or safety was observed, 
however, data are still limited. Neutralising antibodies were not evaluated.
Clinical efficacy and safety
Study GCT3013-01 was an open-label, multi-cohort, multicentre, single-arm study that evaluated 
epcoritamab as monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) 
after two or more lines of systemic therapy, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The 
study includes a dose escalation part and an expansion part. The expansion part of the study included an 
aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (aNHL) cohort, an indolent NHL (iNHL) cohort and a mantle-cell 
lymphoma (MCL) cohort. The pivotal aNHL cohort consisted of patients with LBCL (N=157), 
including patients with DLBCL (N=139, 12 patients of which had MYC, BCL2, and/or BCL6 
rearrangements i.e., DH/TH), with high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL) (N=9), with follicular 
lymphoma grade 3B (FL) (N=5) and patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) 
(N=4). In the DLBCL cohort, 29% (40/139) of patients had transformed DLBCL arising from indolent 
lymphoma. Patients included in the study were required to have documented CD20+ mature B-cell 
neoplasm according to WHO classification 2016 or WHO classification 2008 based on representative 
pathology report, failed prior autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or were 
ineligible for autologous HSCT, patients who had lymphocyte counts < 5×109/L, and patients with at 
least 1 prior anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody-containing therapy.
The study excluded patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement of lymphoma, prior 
treatment with allogeneic HSCT or solid organ transplant, chronic ongoing infectious diseases, any 
patients with known impaired T-cell immunity, a creatinine clearance of less than 45 ml/min, alanine 
aminotransferase > 3 times the upper limit of normal, cardiac ejection fraction less than 45%, and 
known clinically significant cardiovascular disease. Efficacy was evaluated in 139 patients with 
DLBCL who had received at least one dose of epcoritamab SC in cycles of 4 weeks, i.e., 28 days. 
Epcoritamab monotherapy was administered as follows:
 Cycle 1: epcoritamab 0.16 mg on Day 1, 0.8 mg on Day 8, 48 mg on Day 15 and Day 22
 Cycles 2-3: epcoritamab 48 mg on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22
 Cycles 4-9: epcoritamab 48 mg on Days 1 and 15
 Cycles 10 and beyond: epcoritamab 48 mg on Day 1
16
Patients continued to receive epcoritamab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
The demographics and baseline characteristics are shown in Table 7.

Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
epcoritamab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of mature B-cell 
malignancies, as per paediatric investigation plan (PIP) decision, for the granted indication (see section 
4.2 for information on paediatric use).
Conditional approval
This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. This 
means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. The European Medicines Agency will 
review new information on this medicinal product at least every year and this SmPC will be updated as 
necessary.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
The population pharmacokinetics following subcutaneous administration of epcoritamab was described 
by a two-compartment model with first order subcutaneous absorption and target-mediated drug 
elimination. The moderate to high pharmacokinetic variability for epcoritamab was observed and 
characterised by inter-individual variability (IIV) ranging from 25.7% to 137.5% coefficient of variation 
(CV) for epcoritamab PK parameters.
Based on individually estimated exposures using population pharmacokinetic modelling, following the 
recommended SC dose of epcoritamab 48 mg, the geometric mean (% CV) Cmax of epcoritamab is 
18
10.8 mcg/ml (41.7%) and AUC0-7d is 68.9 day*mcg/ml (45.1%) at the end of the weekly dosing 
schedule. The Ctrough at Week 12 is 8.4 (53.3%) mcg/ml.
The geometric mean (% CV) Cmax of epcoritamab is 7.52 mcg/ml (41.1%) and AUC0-14d is 
82.6 day*mcg/ml (49.3%) at the end of q2w schedule. The Ctrough for q2W schedule is 
4.1 (73.9%) mcg/ml.
The geometric mean (% CV) Cmax of epcoritamab is 4.76 mcg/ml (51.6%) and AUC0-28d is 
74.3 day*mcg/ml (69.5%) at steady state during the q4w schedule. The Ctrough for q4W schedule is 
1.2 (130%) mcg/ml.
Absorption
The peak concentrations occurred around 3-4 days (Tmax) in patients with LBCL receiving the 48 mg 
full dose.
Distribution
The geometric mean (% CV) central volume of distribution is 8.27 l (27.5%) and apparent steady-state 
volume of distribution is 25.6 l (81.8%) based on population PK modelling.
Biotransformation
The metabolic pathway of epcoritamab has not been directly studied. Like other protein therapeutics, 
epcoritamab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways. 
Elimination
Epcoritamab is expected to undergo saturable target mediated clearance. The geometric mean (% CV) 
clearance (l/day) is 0.441 (27.8%). The half-life of epcoritamab is concentration dependent. The 
population PK model-derived geometric mean half-life of full dose epcoritamab (48 mg) ranged from 
22 to 25 days based on frequency of dosing.
Special populations
No clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of epcoritamab (Cycle 1 AUC within 
approximately 36%) were observed based on age (20 to 89 years), sex, or race/ethnicity (white, Asian, 
and other), mild to moderate renal impairment creatinine clearance (CLcr ≥ 30 ml/min to CLcr 
< 90 ml/min), and mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN, or total bilirubin 1 
to 1.5 times ULN and any AST) after accounting for differences in bodyweight. No patients with severe 
to end-stage renal disease (CLcr < 30 ml/min) or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3 times 
ULN and any AST) have been studied. There is very limited data in moderate hepatic impairment (total 
bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST, N=1). Therefore, the pharmacokinetics of epcoritamab is 
unknown in these populations.
Like other therapeutic proteins, body weight (39 to 144 kg) has a statistically significant effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of epcoritamab. Based on exposure-response analysis and clinical data, considering 
the exposures in patients at either low body weight (e.g., 46 kg) or high body weight (e.g., 105 kg) and 
across body weight categories (< 65 kg, 65-< 85, ≥ 85), the effect on exposures is not clinically 
relevant.
Paediatric population
The pharmacokinetics of epcoritamab in paediatric patients has not been established. 
5.3
Preclinical safety data
19
Animal pharmacology and/or toxicology
No reproductive or developmental toxicity studies in animals have been conducted with epcoritamab.
Effects generally consistent with the pharmacologic mechanism of action of epcoritamab were observed 
in cynomolgus monkeys. These findings included dose-related adverse clinical signs (including 
vomiting, decreased activity, and mortality at high doses) and cytokine release, reversible hematologic 
alterations, reversible B-cell depletion in peripheral blood, and reversible decreased lymphoid 
cellularity in secondary lymphoid tissues.
Mutagenicity
Mutagenicity studies have not been conducted with epcoritamab.
Carcinogenicity
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with epcoritamab.
Impairment of fertility
Animal fertility studies have not been conducted with epcoritamab, however, epcoritamab did not cause 
toxicological changes in the reproductive organs of male or female cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 
1 mg/kg/week in intravenous general toxicity study of 5-week duration. The AUC exposures (time-
averaged over 7 days) at the high dose in cynomolgus monkeys were similar to those in patients 
(AUC0-7d) receiving the recommended dose.

Tepkinly should be administered to adequately hydrated patients. Patients at an increased risk for 
clinical tumour lysis syndrome (CTLS) are recommended to receive hydration and prophylactic 
treatment with a uric acid lowering agent.
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CRS and/or immune effector cell-associated 
neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) following epcoritamab administration. Patients should be hospitalised 
for 24 hours after administration of the Cycle 1 Day 15 dose of 48 mg to monitor for signs and 
symptoms of CRS and/or ICANS. Patients should be counselled on the signs and symptoms associated 
with CRS and ICANS and on seeking immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms occur at 
any time (see section 4.4).
Dose modifications and management of adverse reactions 
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)
Patients treated with epcoritamab may develop CRS. 
Evaluate for and treat other causes of fever, hypoxia, and hypotension. If CRS is suspected, manage 
according to the recommendations in Table 3. Patients who experience CRS should be monitored more 
frequently during next scheduled epcoritamab administration.

Missed or delayed dose
A re-priming Cycle (identical to Cycle 1 with standard CRS prophylaxis) is required: 



If there are more than 8 days between the priming dose (0.16 mg) and intermediate dose 
(0.8 mg), or
If there are more than 14 days between the intermediate dose (0.8 mg) and first full dose 
(48 mg), or
If there are more than 6 weeks between full doses (48 mg) 
After the re-priming cycle, the patient should resume treatment with Day 1 of the next planned 
treatment cycle (subsequent to the cycle during which the dose was delayed).
Special populations
Renal impairment
Dose adjustments are not considered necessary in patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. 
Epcoritamab has not been studied in patients with severe renal impairment to end stage renal disease. 
No dose recommendations can be made for patients with severe renal impairment to end-stage renal 
disease (see section 5.2).
30
Hepatic impairment
Dose adjustments are not considered necessary in patients with mild hepatic impairment. Epcoritamab 
has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (defined as total bilirubin > 3 times 
ULN and any AST) and data are limited in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (defined as total 
bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST). No dose recommendations can be made for patients with 
moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Elderly
No dose adjustment is necessary in patients ≥ 65 years of age (see sections 5.1 and 5.2).
Paediatric population
The safety and efficacy of Tepkinly in children aged less than 18 years of age have not yet been 
established. No data are available.
Method of administration
Tepkinly is for subcutaneous use. It should be administered by subcutaneous injection only, preferably 
in the lower part of the abdomen or the thigh. Change of injection site from left to right side or vice 
versa is recommended especially during the weekly administration schedule (i.e., Cycles 1-3).
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number of 
the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)
CRS, which may be life-threatening or fatal, occurred in patients receiving epcoritamab. The most 
common signs and symptoms of CRS include pyrexia, hypotension and hypoxia. Other signs and 
symptoms of CRS in more than two patients include chills, tachycardia, headache and dyspnoea.
Most CRS events occurred in Cycle 1 and were associated with the first full dose of epcoritamab. 
Administer prophylactic corticosteroids to mitigate the risk of CRS (see section 4.2).
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of CRS following epcoritamab administration. 
Patients should be hospitalised for 24 hours after administration of the Cycle 1 Day 15 dose of 48 mg to 
monitor for signs and symptoms of CRS. At the first signs or symptoms of CRS, treatment should be 
instituted of supportive care with tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids as appropriate (see section 4.2, 
Table 3). Patients should be counselled on the signs and symptoms associated with CRS and patients 
should be instructed to contact their healthcare professional and seek immediate medical attention 
should signs or symptoms occur at any time. Management of CRS may require either temporary delay 
or discontinuation of epcoritamab based on the severity of CRS (see section 4.2).
Immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS)
31
ICANS, including a fatal event, have occurred in patients receiving epcoritamab. ICANS may manifest 
as aphasia, altered level of consciousness, impairment of cognitive skills, motor weakness, seizures, and 
cerebral oedema.
The majority of cases of ICANS occurred within Cycle 1 of epcoritamab treatment, however some 
occurred with delayed onset. 
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of ICANS following epcoritamab administration.
Patients should be hospitalised for 24 hours after administration of the Cycle 1 Day 15 dose of 48 mg to 
monitor for signs and symptoms of ICANS. At the first signs or symptoms of ICANS, treatment with 
corticosteroids and non-sedating-anti-seizure medicinal products should be instituted as appropriate (see 
section 4.2). Patients should be counselled on the signs and symptoms of ICANS and that the onset of 
events may be delayed. Patients should be instructed to contact their healthcare professional and seek 
immediate medical attention should signs or symptoms occur at any time. Epcoritamab should be 
delayed or discontinued as recommended (see section 4.2).
Serious infections
Treatment with epcoritamab may lead to an increased risk of infections. Serious or fatal infections were 
observed in patients treated with epcoritamab in clinical studies (see section 4.8). 
Administration of epcoritamab should be avoided in patients with clinically significant active systemic 
infections.
As appropriate, prophylactic antimicrobials should be administered prior to and during treatment with 
epcoritamab (see section 4.2). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of infection, before 
and after epcoritamab administration, and treated appropriately. In the event of febrile neutropenia, 
patients should be evaluated for infection and managed with antibiotics, fluids and other supportive 
care, according to local guidelines.
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS)
TLS has been reported in patients receiving epcoritamab (see section 4.8). Patients at an increased risk 
for TLS are recommended to receive hydration and prophylactic treatment with a uric acid lowering 
agent. Patients should be monitored for signs or symptoms of TLS, especially patients with high tumour 
burden or rapidly proliferative tumours, and patients with reduced renal function. Patients should be 
monitored for blood chemistries and abnormalities should be managed promptly.
Tumour flare
Tumour flare has been reported in patients treated with epcoritamab (see section 4.8). Manifestations 
could include localised pain and swelling. Consistent with the mechanism of action of epcoritamab, 
tumour flare is likely due to the influx of T-cells into tumour sites following epcoritamab 
administration. 
There are no specific risk factors for tumour flare that have been identified; however, there is a 
heightened risk of compromise and morbidity due to mass effect secondary to tumour flare in patients 
with bulky tumours located in close proximity to airways and/or a vital organ. Patients treated with 
epcoritamab should be monitored and evaluated for tumour flare at critical anatomical sites.
CD20-negative disease 
There are limited data available on patients with CD20-negative DLBCL treated with Tepkinly, and it is 
possible that patients with CD20-negative DLBCL may have less benefit compared to patients with 
CD20-positive DLBCL. The potential risks and benefits associated with treatment of patients with 
CD20-negative DLBCL with Tepkinly should be considered.
32
Patient card
The doctor must inform the patient of the risk of CRS and ICANS and any signs and symptoms of CRS
and ICANS. Patients must be instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they experience signs 
and symptoms of CRS and/or ICANS. Patients should be provided with a patient card and instructed to 
carry the card at all times. This card describes symptoms of CRS and ICANS which, if experienced, 
should prompt the patient to seek immediate medical attention.
Immunisation 
Live and/or live-attenuated vaccines should not be given during epcoritamab therapy. Studies have not 
been conducted in patients who received live vaccines.
Excipients with known effect
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.
This medicinal product contains 21.9 mg of sorbitol per vial, which is equivalent to 27.33 mg/ml.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed.
Transient elevation of certain proinflammatory cytokines by epcoritamab may suppress CYP450 
enzyme activities. On initiation of epcoritamab therapy in patients being treated with CYP450 substrates 
with a narrow therapeutic index, therapeutic monitoring should be considered.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in females
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to use effective contraception during treatment with 
epcoritamab and for at least 4 months after the last dose. Verify pregnancy status in females of 
reproductive potential prior to initiating epcoritamab treatment.
Pregnancy
Based on its mechanism of action, epcoritamab may cause foetal harm, including B-cell 
lymphocytopenia and alterations in normal immune responses, when administered to pregnant women. 
There are no data on the use of epcoritamab in pregnant women. Animal reproduction studies have not 
been conducted with epcoritamab. IgG1 antibodies, such as epcoritamab, can cross the placenta 
resulting in foetal exposure. Advise pregnant women of the potential risk to a foetus.
Epcoritamab is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception.
Breast-feeding
It is not known whether epcoritamab is excreted in human milk or its effect on milk production. Since 
IgGs are known to be present in milk, neonatal exposure to epcoritamab may occur via lactational 
transfer. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment with epcoritamab and for at 
least4 months after the last dose.
Fertility
No fertility studies have been conducted with epcoritamab (see section 5.3). The effect of epcoritamab 
on male and female fertility is unknown.
33
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Epcoritamab has minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Due to the potential for 
ICANS, patients should be advised to exercise caution while (or avoid if symptomatic) driving, cycling
or using heavy or potentially dangerous machines. 
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
The safety of epcoritamab was evaluated in a non-randomised, single-arm study in 167 patients with 
relapsed or refractory LBCL after two or more lines of systemic therapy and included all the patients 
who enrolled to the 48 mg dose and received at least one dose of epcoritamab.  
The median duration of exposure to epcoritamab was 3.7 months (range: 0 to 25 months).
The most common adverse reactions (≥ 20%) were CRS, fatigue, neutropenia, injection site reactions, 
musculoskeletal pain, abdominal pain, pyrexia, nausea, and diarrhoea.
Serious adverse reactions occurred in 52% of patients. The most frequent serious adverse reaction 
(≥ 10%) was cytokine release syndrome (31%). Seven patients (4.2%) experienced a fatal adverse 
reaction (pneumonia in 3 (1.8%) patients, viral infection in 3 (1.8%) patients, and ICANS in 1 (0.6%) 
patient).
Adverse reactions that led to discontinuation occurred in 6.6% of patients. Discontinuation of 
epcoritamab due to pneumonia occurred in 6 (3.6%) patients, viral infection in 3 (1.8%) patients, and 
CRS, ICANS, or fatigue in 1 (0.6%) patient each.
Dose delays due to adverse reactions occurred in 32% of patients. Adverse reactions leading to dose 
delays (≥ 3%) were viral infections (9.6%), CRS (7.2%), neutropenia (4.8%), pyrexia (3.0%), and 
thrombocytopenia (3.0%).
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
Adverse reactions for epcoritamab from clinical studies (Table 6) are listed by MedDRA system organ 
class and are based on the following convention: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); 
uncommon (≥ 1/1 000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10 000 to < 1/1 000); and very rare (< 1/10 000).
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions
Cytokine release syndrome
CRS of any grade occurred in 51% (85/167) of patients treated with epcoritamab. The incidence of 
Grade 1 was 31%, Grade 2 was 17%, and Grade 3 occurred in 3.0% of patients. Recurrent CRS 
occurred in 17% of patients. CRS of any grade occurred in 6.6% of patients after the priming dose 
(Cycle 1 Day 1); 13% after the intermediate dose (Cycle 1, Day 8); 44% after the first full dose (Cycle 
1, Day 15), 4.6% after the second full dose (Cycle 1 Day 22) and 2.8% after the third full dose (Cycle 2 
Day 1) or beyond. The median time to onset of CRS from the most recent administered epcoritamab 
dose was 2 days (range: 1 to 11 days). The median time to onset after the first full dose was 20.2 hours 
(range: 0.2 to 7 days). CRS resolved in 100% of patients, and the median duration of CRS events was 
2 days (range 0.1 to 27 days).
Of the 85 patients that experienced CRS, the most common signs and symptoms of CRS included 
pyrexia 99%, hypotension 31% and hypoxia 19%. Other signs and symptoms of CRS in greater than 
two patients included chills (11%), tachycardia (including sinus tachycardia (9%)), dyspnoea (3.5%), 
and headache (3.5%). Transient elevated liver enzymes (ALT or AST > 3xULN) were concurrent with 
CRS in 2.4% of patients with CRS. See section 4.2 and 4.4 for monitoring and management guidance.

ICANS occurred in 6.0% of patients treated with epcoritamab; 4.2% experienced Grade 1 and 1.2% 
experienced Grade 2. One patient (0.6%) experienced an ICANS event of Grade 5 (fatal). The median 
time to first ICANS onset from the start of epcoritamab treatment (Cycle 1 Day 1) was 16.5 days 
(range: 8 to 141 days). ICANS resolved in 90% (9/10) of patients with supportive care. The median 
time to resolution of ICANS was 5 days (range: 1 to 9 days). In the 10 patients with ICANS, the onset 
of ICANS was prior to CRS in 20% of patients, concurrent with CRS in 40%, following onset of CRS 
in 10%, and in the absence of CRS in 30%.
Serious infections
Serious infections of any grade occurred in 25% of patients treated with epcoritamab. The most frequent 
serious infections included COVID-19 (6.6%), COVID-19 pneumonia (4.2%), pneumonia (3.6%), 
sepsis (2.4%), upper respiratory tract infection (1.8%), bacteraemia (1.2%), and septic shock (1.2%).
The median time to onset of first serious infection from the start of epcoritamab treatment (Cycle 1 Day 
1) was 56 days (range: 4 to 631 days), with median duration of 15 days (range: 4 to 125 days). Grade 5 
events of infections occurred in 7 (4.2%) patients. 
Neutropenia
Neutropenia of any grade occurred in 31% of patients, including 23% Grade 3-4 events. The median 
time to onset of first neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased event was 65 days (range: 1 to 750 days), 
with median duration of 15 days (range: 2 to 155 days). Of the 51 patients who had 
neutropenia/neutrophil count decreased events, 51% received G-CSF to treat the events.
Tumour lysis syndrome 
TLS occurred in 1.8% of patients. There was one patient who experienced onset on Day 14 with
resolution on Day 17. Two additional patients experienced onset on Day 8 and Day 33 and both events 
were ongoing at the time of death; the deaths were due to disease progression. 
Tumour flare 
Tumour flare occurred in 3.0% of patients, all of which were grade 2. The median time to onset was 
17 days (range 9 to 34 days), and median duration was 15.5 days (range 1 to 50 days).

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, other antineoplastic agents, ATC code: not yet 
assigned
Mechanism of action
37
Epcoritamab is a humanised IgG1-bispecific antibody that binds to a specific extracellular epitope of 
CD20 on B cells and to CD3 on T cells. The activity of epcoritamab is dependent upon simultaneous 
engagement of CD20-expressing cancer cells and CD3-expressing endogenous T cells by epcoritamab 
that induces specific T-cell activation and T-cell-mediated killing of CD20-expressing cells.
Epcoritamab Fc region is silenced to prevent target-independent immune effector mechanisms, such as 
antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), complement-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (CDC), 
and antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP). 
Pharmacodynamic effects
Epcoritamab induced rapid and sustained depletion of circulating B-cells (defined as CD19 B-cell 
counts < 10 cell/µl in the subjects who have detectable B cells at treatment initiation). There were 21%
subjects (n=33) who had detectable circulating B-cells at treatment initiation. Transient reduction in 
circulating T cells was observed immediately after each dose in Cycle 1 and followed by T cell 
expansion in subsequent cycles.
Following subcutaneous administration of epcoritamab, transient and modest elevations of circulating 
levels of selected cytokines (IFN-γ, TNFα, IL-6, IL-2, and IL-10) occurred mostly after the first full 
dose (48 mg), with peak levels between 1 to 4 days post dose. Cytokine levels returned to baseline prior 
to the next full dose, however elevations of cytokines could also be observed after Cycle 1.
Immunogenicity
Anti-drug antibodies (ADA) were commonly detected. The incidence of treatment-emergent ADAs at 
the approved 48 mg dosing regimen in the target DLBCL population was 2.9% (2.9% positive, 2.9% 
indeterminate and 94.3% negative, N=140 evaluable patients) and 2.6% (2.6% positive, 2.6% 
indeterminate and 94.9% negative, N= 39 evaluable patients), in studies GCT3013-01 and GCT3013-
04, respectively. No evidence of ADA impact on pharmacokinetics, efficacy or safety was observed, 
however, data are still limited. Neutralising antibodies were not evaluated.
Clinical efficacy and safety
Study GCT3013-01 was an open-label, multi-cohort, multicentre, single-arm study that evaluated 
epcoritamab as monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma (LBCL) 
after two or more lines of systemic therapy, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). The 
study includes a dose escalation part and an expansion part. The expansion part of the study included an 
aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma (aNHL) cohort, an indolent NHL (iNHL) cohort and a mantle-cell 
lymphoma (MCL) cohort. The pivotal aNHL cohort consisted of patients with LBCL (N=157), 
including patients with DLBCL (N=139, 12 patients of which had MYC, BCL2, and/or BCL6 
rearrangements i.e., DH/TH), with high-grade B-cell lymphoma (HGBCL) (N=9), with follicular 
lymphoma grade 3B (FL) (N=5) and patients with primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma (PMBCL) 
(N=4). In the DLBCL cohort, 29% (40/139) of patients had transformed DLBCL arising from indolent 
lymphoma. Patients included in the study were required to have documented CD20+ mature B-cell 
neoplasm according to WHO classification 2016 or WHO classification 2008 based on representative 
pathology report, failed prior autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or were 
ineligible for autologous HSCT, patients who had lymphocyte counts < 5×109/L, and patients with at 
least 1 prior anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody-containing therapy. 
The study excluded patients with central nervous system (CNS) involvement of lymphoma, prior 
treatment with allogeneic HSCT or solid organ transplant, chronic ongoing infectious diseases, any 
patients with known impaired T-cell immunity, a creatinine clearance of less than 45 ml/min, alanine 
aminotransferase > 3 times the upper limit of normal, cardiac ejection fraction less than 45%, and 
known clinically significant cardiovascular disease. Efficacy was evaluated in 139 patients with 
DLBCL who had received at least one dose of epcoritamab SC in cycles of 4 weeks, i.e., 28 days. 
Epcoritamab monotherapy was administered as follows:
38
 Cycle 1: epcoritamab 0.16 mg on Day 1, 0.8 mg on Day 8, 48 mg on Day 15 and Day 22
 Cycles 2-3: epcoritamab 48 mg on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22
 Cycles 4-9: epcoritamab 48 mg on Days 1 and 15
 Cycles 10 and beyond: epcoritamab 48 mg on Day 1
Patients continued to receive epcoritamab until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
The demographics and baseline characteristics are shown in Table 7.

Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
epcoritamab in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of mature B-cell 
malignancies, as per paediatric investigation plan (PIP) decision, for the granted indication (see section 
4.2 for information on paediatric use).
Conditional approval
This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. This 
means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. The European Medicines Agency will 
review new information on this medicinal product at least every year and this SmPC will be updated as 
necessary.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
The population pharmacokinetics following subcutaneous administration of epcoritamab was described 
by a two-compartment model with first order subcutaneous absorption and target-mediated drug 
40
elimination. The moderate to high pharmacokinetic variability for epcoritamab was observed and 
characterised by inter-individual variability (IIV) ranging from 25.7% to 137.5% coefficient of variation 
(CV) for epcoritamab PK parameters.
Based on individually estimated exposures using population pharmacokinetic modelling, following the 
recommended SC dose of epcoritamab 48 mg, the geometric mean (% CV) Cmax of epcoritamab is 
10.8 mcg/ml (41.7%) and AUC0-7d is 68.9 day*mcg/ml (45.1%) at the end of the weekly dosing 
schedule. The Ctrough at Week 12 is 8.4 (53.3%) mcg/ml.
The geometric mean (% CV) Cmax of epcoritamab is 7.52 mcg/ml (41.1%) and AUC0-14d is 82.6 
day*mcg/ml (49.3%) at the end of q2w schedule. The Ctrough for q2W schedule is 4.1 (73.9%) mcg/ml.
The geometric mean (% CV) Cmax of epcoritamab is 4.76 mcg/ml (51.6%) and AUC0-28d is 74.3 
day*mcg/ml (69.5%) at steady state during the q4w schedule. The Ctrough for q4W schedule is 
1.2 (130%) mcg/ml.
Absorption
The peak concentrations occurred around 3-4 days (Tmax) in patients with LBCL receiving the 48 mg
full dose.
Distribution
The geometric mean (% CV) central volume of distribution is 8.27 l (27.5%) and apparent steady-state 
volume of distribution is 25.6 l (81.8%) based on population PK modelling.
Biotransformation
The metabolic pathway of epcoritamab has not been directly studied. Like other protein therapeutics, 
epcoritamab is expected to be degraded into small peptides and amino acids via catabolic pathways. 
Elimination
Epcoritamab is expected to undergo saturable target mediated clearance. The geometric mean (% CV) 
clearance (l/day) is 0.441 (27.8%). The half-life of epcoritamab is concentration dependent. The 
population PK model-derived geometric mean half-life of full dose epcoritamab (48 mg) ranged from 
22 to 25 days based on frequency of dosing. 
Special populations
No clinically important effects on the pharmacokinetics of epcoritamab (Cycle 1 AUC within 
approximately 36%) were observed based on age (20 to 89 years), sex, or race/ethnicity (white, Asian, 
and other), mild to moderate renal impairment creatinine clearance (CLcr ≥ 30 ml/min to CLcr 
< 90 ml/min), and mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN, or total bilirubin 1 
to 1.5 times ULN and any AST) after accounting for differences in bodyweight. No patients with severe 
to end-stage renal disease (CLcr < 30 ml/min) or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin > 3 times 
ULN and any AST) have been studied. There is very limited data in moderate hepatic impairment (total 
bilirubin > 1.5 to 3 times ULN and any AST, N=1). Therefore, the pharmacokinetics of epcoritamab is 
unknown in these populations.
Like other therapeutic proteins, body weight (39 to 144 kg) has a statistically significant effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of epcoritamab. Based on exposure-response analysis and clinical data, considering 
the exposures in patients at either low body weight (e.g., 46 kg) or high body weight (e.g., 105 kg) and 
across body weight categories (< 65 kg, 65-< 85, ≥ 85), the effect on exposures is not clinically 
relevant.
Paediatric population
41
The pharmacokinetics of epcoritamab in paediatric patients has not been established. 
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Animal pharmacology and/or toxicology
No reproductive or developmental toxicity studies in animals have been conducted with epcoritamab.
Effects generally consistent with the pharmacologic mechanism of action of epcoritamab were observed 
in cynomolgus monkeys. These findings included dose-related adverse clinical signs (including 
vomiting, decreased activity, and mortality at high doses) and cytokine release, reversible hematologic 
alterations, reversible B-cell depletion in peripheral blood, and reversible decreased lymphoid 
cellularity in secondary lymphoid tissues.
Mutagenicity
Mutagenicity studies have not been conducted with epcoritamab.
Carcinogenicity
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted with epcoritamab.
Impairment of fertility
Animal fertility studies have not been conducted with epcoritamab, however, epcoritamab did not cause 
toxicological changes in the reproductive organs of male or female cynomolgus monkeys at doses up to 
1 mg/kg/week in intravenous general toxicity study of 5-week duration. The AUC exposures (time-
averaged over 7 days) at the high dose in cynomolgus monkeys were similar to those in patients 
(AUC0-7d) receiving the recommended dose.

Possible side effects
1. What Tepkinly is and what it is used for
What Tepkinly is
Tepkinly is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance epcoritamab. Tepkinly is used on its 
own (monotherapy) to treat adult patients who have a blood cancer called diffuse large B-cell 
lymphoma (DLBCL) when the disease has come back or did not respond to previous treatment after at 
least two prior therapies.
How Tepkinly works 
Epcoritamab is specifically designed to help your own immune system to attack cancer (lymphoma)
cells. Epcoritamab acts by attaching to your body’s immune cells and cancer cells, bringing them 
together, so that your immune system can destroy the cancer cells.
2. What you need to know before you use Tepkinly
Do not use Tepkinly
If you are allergic to epcoritamab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6).
If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Tepkinly.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Tepkinly if you

have current or past problems with your nervous system – such as seizures
57


have an infection
are due to have a vaccine or you know you may need to have one in the near future.
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given
Tepkinly.
Tell your doctor straight away if you get symptoms of any of the side effects listed below, during or 
after treatment with Tepkinly. You may need additional medical treatment.
 Cytokine release syndrome – a life-threatening condition causing fever, vomiting, difficulty 
breathing/shortness of breath, chills, rapid heartbeat, headache and dizziness or light-
headedness associated with medicines that stimulate T cells. 
− Before each injection under the skin, you may be given medicines which help reduce 

possible effects of cytokine release syndrome.
ICANS (immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome)- Symptoms may 
include problems with use of language (including speech, understanding, writing and 
reading), drowsiness, confusion/disorientation, muscle weakness, seizures, swelling of a part 
of the brain, and memory loss.
 Tumour lysis syndrome – some people may get unusual levels of some salts in the blood –
caused by the fast breakdown of cancer cells during treatment. This is called tumour lysis 
syndrome (TLS).
o Your doctor or nurse will do blood tests to check for this condition. Before each 
injection under the skin, you should be well-hydrated and may be given other 
medicines that can help reduce high levels of uric acid and help reduce possible 
effects of tumour lysis syndrome.
 Tumour flare – as your cancer is destroyed, it may react and appear to get worse – this is 

called ‘tumour flare reaction’.
Infections – you may get signs of infection, such as fever of 38 °C or above, chills, cough, or 
pain with urination which can vary depending on where in the body the infection is.
Children and adolescents
Tepkinly is not recommended in children and adolescents under 18 years, as there is no information 
about use in this age group.
Other medicines and Tepkinly
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or using, have recently taken or used, or might take or 
use any other medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription and herbal medicines.
Pregnancy
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Do not use Tepkinly during pregnancy, as it may 
affect your unborn baby. Your doctor may ask you to take a pregnancy test before starting treatment. 
Contraception
If you are a woman who is able to have children, you must use effective contraception to avoid 
becoming pregnant while taking Tepkinly and for at least 4 months after your last dose of Tepkinly. If
you become pregnant during this time, you must talk to your doctor straight away.
Talk to your doctor or nurse about suitable methods of contraception.
Breast-feeding
58
You must not breast-feed during treatment with Tepkinly and for at least 4 months after the last dose. It 
is not known whether Tepkinly passes into breast milk and whether it could affect your baby.
Fertility
The effect of Tepkinly on male and female fertility is unknown.
Driving and using machines
Due to the possible symptoms of ICANS, you should be careful while driving, cycling or using heavy or 
potentially dangerous machines. If you currently have such symptoms, avoid these activities and contact 
your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist. See section 4 for more information about side effects. 
Tepkinly contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.
Tepkinly contains sorbitol
This medicine contains 21.9 mg sorbitol in each vial, which is equivalent to 27.33 mg/ml.
3.
How Tepkinly will be given
A doctor experienced in treating cancer will take care of your treatment. Follow the treatment schedule 
explained to you by your doctor.
Tepkinly will be given to you by a doctor or nurse as an injection under your skin.
Tepkinly will be given to you in cycles of 28 days, on a dosing schedule given to you by your doctor.
You will be given Tepkinly according to the following schedule
Cycle
Cycles 1 to 3
Cycles 4 to 9
Cycles 10 and beyond
Dosing schedule
Weekly
Every two weeks
Every four weeks 
You may be given other medicines before you are given Tepkinly. This is to help prevent reactions such 
as cytokine release syndrome and fever in Cycle 1 (and potentially future cycles). 
These medicines may include 
 Corticosteroids – such as prednisolone or equivalent 
 An antihistamine – such as diphenhydramine 

Paracetamol
The first full dose (48 mg) of Tepkinly will be given to you on Cycle 1 Day 15. Your doctor will 
monitor how your treatment is working and ask you to stay in a hospital for 24 hours after the first full 
dose (48 mg) because this is when reactions such as CRS, ICANS and fever are most likely to happen.
You will be given Tepkinly for as long as your doctor thinks you are benefitting from the treatment.
Your doctor may delay or completely stop your treatment with Tepkinly if you have certain side effects.
If you forget to use Tepkinly
If you forget or miss your medical appointment, make another one straight away. For the treatment to be 
fully effective, it is very important not to miss a dose.
59
If you stop using Tepkinly
Do not stop treatment with Tepkinly unless you have discussed this with your doctor. This is because 
stopping treatment may make your condition worse. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

The first full dose (48 mg) of Tepkinly will be given to you on Cycle 1 Day 15. Your doctor will 
monitor how your treatment is working and ask you to stay in a hospital for 24 hours after the first full 
dose (48 mg) because this is when reactions such as CRS, ICANS and fever are most likely to happen.
You will be given Tepkinly for as long as your doctor thinks you are benefitting from the treatment.
Your doctor may delay or completely stop your treatment with Tepkinly if you have certain side effects.
If you forget to use Tepkinly
If you forget or miss your medical appointment, make another one straight away. For the treatment to be 
fully effective, it is very important not to miss a dose.
If you stop using Tepkinly

stopping treatment may make your condition worse.

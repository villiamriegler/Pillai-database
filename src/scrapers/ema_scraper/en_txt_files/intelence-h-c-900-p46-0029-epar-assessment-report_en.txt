1.  INTRODUCTION 
In accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) N° 1901/2006, Tibotec, on behalf of the MAH Janssen-
Cilag International, is submitting the final report for trial TMC125-C126, a Phase I, open-label trial to 
investigate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of TMC125 at steady state in treatment-
experienced HIV-infected children. The study is also part of the follow-up measure FUM C013.  
Of note, the same information was submitted in 2008 to the Pediatric Committee as part of the 
Pediatric Implementation Plan and in March 2009 to the Article 46-mailbox of the EMEA.  
Trial TMC125-C126 is part of a clinical development program. The variation application consisting of 
the full relevant data package (i.e. containing several studies) is expected to be submitted by 4Q2011, 
as indicated in the recent PIP.  
The MAH stated that in accordance with Article 16(2) of Regulation (EC) N° 726/2004, the data 
submitted do not influence the benefit-risk balance for INTELENCE and therefore do not require to take 
further regulatory action on the marketing authorization for INTELENCE at this stage. 
2.  SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
2.1.  Introduction 
Etravirine (ETR, INTELENCE) belongs to the class of non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor 
(NNRTI) drugs and is administered via the oral route of administration. ETR, in combination with other 
antiretroviral medicinal products, is indicated for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 
1 (HIV-1) infection in antiretroviral treatment-experienced adult patients, including those with NNRTI 
resistance. 
The objective of this clinical overview is to support the submission of the pediatric clinical data from 
trial TMC125-C126 in accordance with Art 46 from Regulation N° 1901/2006.  
2.2.  Study TMC125-C126 
2.2.1.  Description of the study 
Trial TMC125-C126 was the initial step in the pediatric program to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
etravirine in children and adolescents.  
This was a Phase I, open-label, dose-ranging trial to evaluate pharmacokinetics, and short-term safety 
and tolerability of etravirine at steady-state in HIV-1 infected children who are virologically 
suppressed. The trial has been conducted to obtain dose recommendations of etravirine per body 
weight in treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected children ≥ 6 years old and weighing ≥ 20 kg. 
Etravirine was administered as formulation F060 (100 mg tablet) and/or as formulation F066 (25 mg 
tablet).  
The trial population comprised of subjects taking a stable ARV regimen that included lopinavir/ritonavir 
(LPV/rtv) and a minimum of 2 NRTIs, with or without enfuvirtide (ENF).

Trial TMC125-C126 was conducted in two sequential stages, in Stage I the dose of etravirine was 4 
mg/kg b.i.d. and in Stage II the dose of etravirine was 5.2 mg/kg b.i.d. (representing a 30% increase 
from 4 mg/kg b.i.d.). In each Stage, at least 20 virologically suppressed (Viral Load < 50 copies/ml) 
children on a LPV/rtv containing regimen received etravirine for 7 days followed by an intensive 12-
hour pharmacokinetic assessment of etravirine on Day 8. 
The primary objective of trial TMC125-C126 was to achieve comparable pharmacokinetics in children 
as in adults.  
Trial TMC125-C228 was chosen as the protocol-specified reference for TMC125-C126 since, at the 
time, it provided the pharmacokinetic parameters and associated variability of TMC125 administered as 
formulation F060, 200 mg b.i.d. in treatment-experienced HIV-1 infected adults who were currently 
receiving a boosted PI (primarily LPV/rtv). 
During the conduct of Stage 2 of this Phase I trial TMC125-C126, results from the Phase III trials, 
DUET-1 and -2, became available demonstrating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of TMC125 in 
adults over 48 weeks. Results of these studies were also taken into account for analysis.  
2.2.1.1.  Statistical Methods 
The objective of the trial was to show that the pharmacokinetics in children were in the range of the 
exposures of adults. This was evaluated according to the following criterion: the mean values of the 
exposure (expressed as AUC12h) and of Cmin had to fall within the 80 to 125% of the mean exposure 
and Cmin in adults (mean AUC12h = 3713 ng.h/mL, mean Cmin of 184.7 ng/mL). It was assumed that 
the variability between children was the same as between adults (standard deviation [SD] AUC12h = 
2069 ng.h./mL, SD Cmin = 128.1 ng/mL).  
If subjects discontinued the trial before receiving their first dose of study medication, additional 
subjects could be recruited to have 10 subjects in each age group starting treatment in each stage. If 
more than 2 subjects per age group were prematurely (before treatment completion) withdrawn from 
the trial after starting treatment for reasons other than drug tolerability/safety, additional subjects 
were recruited to aim for at least 8 evaluable subjects per age group. An evaluable subject was a 
subject who had completed an entire treatment period for the stage in which they were enrolled. 
2.2.1.2.  Pharmacokinetic Parameter Analysis 
Based on the individual plasma concentration-time data, using the scheduled sampling times, the 
following pharmacokinetic parameters were derived from the bioanalytical results: For TMC125: On 
Day 8 of Stage 1 and Stage 2: C0h, Cmin, Cmax, tmax, AUC12h, Css,av, and Fl Ind 
2.2.2.  Results  
2.2.2.1.  Subjects and treatment information  
•  Overview  
A total of 29 subjects were screened for Stage 1 of this trial.

An interim analysis of the pharmacokinetic and safety data of this dose, performed when 17 subjects 
completed (or prematurely discontinued) the trial, revealed a pharmacokinetic exposure comparable to 
that seen in a Phase I trial in HIV-1 infected adults, and no major safety or tolerability concerns.  
A total of 26 subjects were screened for Stage 2. 
•  Baseline characteristics  
There were no relevant differences between the 2 stages with respect to demographic and baseline 
characteristics.

•  Antiretroviral therapy 
All subjects were on a stable regimen of LPV/rtv and at least 2 NRTIs, with or without ENF, at 
approved pediatric doses for at least 2 months prior to screening until at least 7 days after the last 
intake of study medication. 
None of the subjects used enfuvirtide as part of their ARV regimen. 
In Stage 1, the most commonly used NRTIs were lamivudine (61.9%), abacavir (33.3%), zidovudine 
(33.3%), and didanosine (28.6%). In Stage 2, the most commonly used NRTIs were lamivudine 
(61.9%), zidovudine (33.3%), didanosine (28.6%) and abavacir (sulphate) (28.6%).

One subject (Stage 2, Group 1) used an NNRTI (i.e., efavirenz) in combination with the allowed OBR 
(LPV/rtv and NRTIs). This was captured as a protocol major violation under disallowed ARVs. 
2.2.2.2.  Pharmacocinetic results 
•  Pharmacokinetics of TMC125  
A summary list of key pharmacokinetic parameters of TMC125 for Stage 1 and 2 are presented in table 
10 below: 
The statistical results comparing Cmin and AUC12h from Stage 1 and 2 versus Cmin and AUC12h 
obtained in HIV-1 infected, treatment experienced adults from the TMC125-C228 trial are presented in 
table 11 and 12 below:  
Based on the ratios of the LSmeans, Cmin and AUC12h of TMC125 were comparable when TMC125 
was administered as 4 mg/kg b.i.d. to children or administered as TMC125 200 mg b.i.d. to adults in 
trial TMC125-C228.

Based on the ratios of the LSmeans, Cmin and AUC12h of TMC125 were increased by 58% when 
TMC125 was administered as 5.2 mg/kg b.i.d. to children compared to administration of 200 mg b.i.d. 
to adults in trial TMC125-C228.  
•  Pharmacokinetics of TMC125 discussed by Age Group 
A summary list of key pharmacokinetic parameters of TMC125 both stages and separated by age group 
are presented in table 13 below:  
The statistical results comparing Cmin and AUC12h from the age groups in Stage 1 and 2 versus the 
Cmin and AUC12h obtained in HIV-infected, treatment experienced adults from the TMC125-C228 trial 
are presented in table 14 to table 17 below:

Based on the ratios of the LSmeans, Cmin and AUC12h of TMC125 were, independent of age group, 
comparable when TMC125 was administered as 4 mg/kg b.i.d. to children or administered as TMC125 
200 mg b.i.d. to adults in trial TMC125-C228.  
Based on the ratios of the LSmeans, Cmin and AUC12h of TMC125 were increased by, 83% and 90%, 
respectively when TMC125 was administered as 5.2 mg/kg b.i.d. to children ≥ 6 and < 12 years old 
compared to administration of 200 mg b.i.d. to adults in trial TMC125-C228.

EMA/150112/2013  
Page 8/10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The LSmeans ratio of Cmin and AUC12h were increased by respectively 31% and 26% when TMC125 
was administered as 5.2 mg/kg b.i.d. to adolescents ≥ 12 and ≤ 17 years old compared to 
administration of 200 mg b.i.d. in adults.  
•  Pharmacokinetics conclusions 
Comparing both age groups within Stage 1 (4 mg/kg b.i.d.) in this trial to HIV-1 infected, treatment-
experienced adults showed that Cmin and AUC12h were independent of age group. 
However, when TMC125 was administered as 5.2 mg/kg b.i.d. in children and adolescents, higher 
Cmin and AUC12h values were observed compared to administration of TMC125 as 200 mg b.i.d. in 
adults (increases by 83% and 90%, respectively, in Group 1 and 31% and 26%, respectively, in Group 
2). 
The results of this trial showed that the exposures achieved with the 5.2 mg/kg b.i.d. dose were 
comparable to those seen in adults participating in the DUET trials [(The mean (SD) population 
pharmacokinetic derived AUC12h and C0h in the pooled Phase III trials, DUET-1 and DUET-2, was 
5506 (4710) ng.h/mL and 393 (391) ng/mL, respectively (N = 575)].  
Therefore, to minimize underexposure to TMC125 and to provide exposures comparable to those 
observed in adults, 5.2 mg/kg b.i.d. is the proposed dose for HIV-1 infected children and adolescents 
between the ages of 6 and 17 years, inclusive. 
2.2.2.3.  Safety results 
Safety analysis from Stage 1 and 2 showed that TMC125 at 4 mg/kg and 5.2 mg/kg b.i.d. was 
generally safe and well tolerated. Overall, 14 subjects (66.7%) and 9 subjects (42.9%) reported at 
least 1 AE in Stage 1 and 2, respectively. The most common AEs were headache and rhinitis. The 
majority of events were grade 1 or 2. One subject in prematurely discontinued the trial due to grade 3 
increased blood creatinine in the predose sample on Day 1 that was considered not related to TMC125. 
One subject had an asymptomatic grade 4 increased triglycerides. No other grade 3 or 4 AEs were 
reported during the course of the trial.  
2.3.  MAH’s conclusion 
A weight adjusted dose of etravirine based on 5.2 mg/kg b.i.d. was selected for treatment experienced 
paediatric subjects aged 6 to 17 years based on the pharmacokinetics of etravirine in adults from the 
DUET trials and the overall safety of etravirine in Stage II of TMC125-C126 trial.  
Further development is currently ongoing in trial TMC125-TiDP35-C213 where the safety, tolerability, 
antiviral activity and population pharmacokinetics of etravirine are investigated in children and 
adolescents aged 6-17 years. 
TMC125-TiDP35-C213 
This study is a Phase II, non-randomized, open label trial to evaluate Safety and Antiviral activity of 
Etravirine (TMC125) in Treatment-Experienced, HIV Infected Children and Adolescents. This study will 
last for a maximum of 48 weeks and will enroll participants aged 6 to 17 years. A total of 100 
participants will receive etravirine tablets based on body weight and an investigator selected OBR of at 
least 2 antiretrovirals (ARVs), consisting of a boosted protease inhibitor (PI) and nucleoside reverse 
transcriptase inhibitor(s) (NRTI[s]). Use of enfuvirtide is optional. Safety will be monitored throughout 
the study. Additional assessment includes changes in the HIV-1 genotype, drug susceptibility, and the

population pharmacokinetics of TMC125. The primary analysis will be performed when all enrolled 
subjects have completed the 24 weeks assessment or have discontinued earlier.  
It is anticipated that an extension application to support a pediatric indication will be submitted in 
4Q2011. The timelines are driven by the ongoing Phase II clinical trial TMC125-TiDP35-C213.

3.  Rapporteur’s Overall Conclusion AND RECOMMENDATION 
The MAH submitted the final report for TMC125-C126, a Phase I, open-label trial to investigate the 
pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of TMC125 at steady state in treatment-experienced HIV-
infected children. 
A weight adjusted dose of 5.2 mg/kg b.i.d. was selected for etravrine treatment experienced paediatric 
subjects aged 6 to 17 years, based on the comparable exposure achieved with this dose and those 
seen  in adults (DUET trials) and its overall safety  in Stage II of TMC125-C126 trial.  
This dose has been already mentioned in the Pediatric Investigation Plan for etravirine and is endorsed 
by the Rapporteur.  
This study is part of the clinical development program for Intelence in paediatric patients. A full 
package, including study TMC125-C126 is anticipated to be submitted by 4Q2011. A full benefit/risk 
assessment will be made in the frame of the upcoming procedure. 
Recommendation  
  Fulfilled –  
No further action required, however further data are expected in the context of a type II 
variation anticipated to be submitted by 4Q2011.

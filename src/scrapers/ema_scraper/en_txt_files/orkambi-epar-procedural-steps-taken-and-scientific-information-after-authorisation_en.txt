As the PASS is finalized, removal of the additional 
EMEA/H/C/PSR/S/0039 – Variation 
monitoring statement and the black triangle from the 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Renewal of the marketing authorisation.

SmPC, Annex 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
II, Labelling 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
and PL 
Orkambi in the approved indication remains favourable, but 
recommended that one additional five-year renewal be 
required based on the following pharmacovigilance 
grounds: 
The following pharmacovigilance issues require a second 
renewal of the marketing authorisation: 
• 
There is an ongoing PASS for Orkambi which aims 
to evaluate the long-term safety of lumacaftor/ivacaftor 
(LUM/IVA) therapy in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). 
Given that this study is categorised as category 1 and the 
results are considered key to benefit risk it is considered 
Page 4/21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
appropriate to have a second renewal of the marketing 
authorisation. 
• 
There is limited exposure and post-marketing data 
available for the recent approvals in paediatric patients (6-
12 years and 2-5 years of age). 
• 
There is a planned PAES study to compare disease 
progression among children with CF homozygous for 
F508del-CFTR and aged 2 through 5 years at the time of 
Orkambi treatment initiation versus disease progression 
among concurrent matched cohort of children with CF who 
have never received Orkambi treatment, in addition to a 
longitudinal historical cohort. This study is expected to 
provide verification of the impact of Orkambi treatment on 
clinical outcomes (including long term safety) and disease 
progression and to confirm current efficacy and safety 
assumptions.  
Therefore, based upon the limited safety profile of 
Orkambi, the CHMP concluded that the MAH should submit 
one additional renewal application in 5 years’ time.

evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of 
Orkambi treatment for 96 weeks in patients with 
cystic fibrosis, 6 years of age and older, homozygous 
for F508del. The MAH also took the opportunity to 
include minor changes to section 4.5 of the Granules

Granules SmPC which were considered acceptable by 
CHMP. In addition, the RMP version 8.0 is

n/a 
trial 7 were included in a phase 3, multicentre, rollover 
extension study (trial 9). This extension trial was designed 
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of long-term treatment 
of lumacaftor/ivacaftor. Of the 262 patients who received 
any treatment in trial 6 or trial 7, 239 (91%) were dosed 
and received active treatment (patients 6 to <12 years of 
age received lumacaftor 200 mg q12h/ivacaftor 250 mg 
q12h; patients ≥12 years of age received lumacaftor 400 
mg q12h/ivacaftor 250 mg q12h) in the extension study for 
up to an additional 96 weeks (i.e. up to a total of 120 
weeks). Overall, long term safety data from a 96-week 
rollover extension study (Trial 9) in 239 patients aged 6 
years and older who were homozygous for the F508del 
mutation in the CFTR gene were generally consistent with 
the 24-week parent studies in patients aged 6 to 11 years 
(Trial 6 and Trial 7).

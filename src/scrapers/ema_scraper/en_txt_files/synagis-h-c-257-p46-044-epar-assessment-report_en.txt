1.  Introduction 
On  November  19,  the  MAH  submitted  a  final  study  report  for  the  post-marketing  observational 
paediatric study p14-579, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has been provided. 
The  MAH  states,  that  the  safety  and  effectiveness  of  this  study  is  consistent  with  the  previously 
established benefit risk profile of Synagis and does not recommend any changes to the SmPC. 
Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that: 
Study  P14-579:  "Prospective,  Multi-Center,  Observational  Program  to  Assess  RSV  Hospitalization 
Rate  in  a  Population  of  Children  at  High-risk  of  Serious  RSV  Illness  who  received  Palivizumab 
Immunoprophylaxis in Routine Clinical Setting in the Russian Federation 
The  MAH  confirms  that  this  study  is  a  stand-alone  study  and  does  not  form  part  of  a  development 
programme. 
1.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study. 
Palivizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1κ) specific for the fusion protein (F-protein) of 
RSV  that  has  potent  neutralizing  and  fusion-inhibitory  activity  against  a  broad  range  of  RSV  isolates. 
Based  on  clinical  studies  in  children  with  chronic  lung  disease  the  product  was  licensed  in  the  US  in 
1998 and in the EU in 1999. Further studies were subsequently conducted in different patient groups. 
The currently approved indications are: 
“SYNAGIS  is  indicated  for  the  prevention  of  serious  lower  respiratory  tract  disease  requiring 
hospitalisation caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in children at high risk for RSV disease:  
• Children born at 35 weeks of gestation or less and less than 6 months of age at the onset of the RSV 
season.  
• Children less than 2 years of age and requiring treatment for bronchopulmonary dysplasia within the 
last 6 months.  
• Children less than 2 years of age and with haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease”  
The pharmaceutical formulations used in the study were: 
Palivizumab  was  provided  in  sterile  vials  containing  100  mg  of  palivizumab  in  1  mL  of  a  sterile 
preservative-free  liquid  product  at  pH  6.0,  formulated  with  25  mM  histidine,  and  1.6  mM  glycine.  All 
participants received IM injections according to the local label, which recommends a 1 month injection 
window between consequential 5 palivizumab injections at a dose of 15 mg/kg.

1.3.  Clinical aspects 
1.3.1.  Introduction 
Synagis  (Pavalizumab)  received  marketing  authorization  through  the  centralised  procedure  in  2009. 
Synagis  was  approved  for  the  prevention  of  serious  lower-respiratory-tract  disease  requiring 
hospitalisation caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) in children at high risk for RSV disease: 
-children born at 35 weeks of gestation or less and less than six months of age at the onset of the RSV 
season; 
-children  less  than two  years  of  age  and  requiring  treatment  for  bronchopulmonary  dysplasia 
(BPD) within the last six months; 
- Children less than two years of age and  with  haemodynamically significant congenital heart disease 
(CHD). 
 The MAH submitted a final report for: 
P14-579: Prospective, Multi-Center, Observational Program to Assess RSV Hospitalization Rate 
in  a  Population  of  Children  at  High-risk  of  Serious  RSV  Illness  Prescribed  for  Palivizumab 
Immunoprophylaxis in Routine Clinical Setting in the Russian Federation. 
Description 
Methods 
Objective 
The primary objective of the study was to assess LRTI hospitalization rate with positive RSV laboratory 
diagnostic test of respiratory secretions and death due to RSV infection in population of infants at high-
risk of serious RSV illness (infants born ≤ 35 weeks of gestation and infants ≤ 24 months with BPD or 
CHD) who received immunoprophylaxis during the RSV season. 
In addition the study assessed several secondary objectives, which primarily evaluated the severity of 
disease. 
Study design 
This  was  a  Phase  4,  prospective,  multicenter,  non-interventional,  non-comparative,  study  that  took 
place in 16 clinical sites located in different regions of Russia. Participants were recruited and observed 
in  national  and  regional  neonatal  centres/hospitals.  Immunoprophylaxis  with  palivizumab  was  given 
during the RSV season from October 2014 through April 2015 in routine clinical settings in the Russian 
Federation. 
Inclusion Criteria 
1. Planned prescription of palivizumab for immunoprophylaxis during RSV season or patients to whom 
palivizumab was prescribed and who received the first dose of palivizumab no later than 60 day before 
enrolment in the study. 
2. Infants at high risk of severe RSV infection defined as fulfilling at least one of the following: 
• 
• 
Infants born ≤ 35 weeks gestational age AND are ≤ 6 months of age at the onset of the RSV 
season; 
Infants ≤ 24 months of age AND with a diagnosis of BPD (defined as oxygenrequirement at a 
corrected gestational age of 36 weeks);

enrollment  or  current  administration  (includes,  but  is  not  restricted  to,  the  following:  RSV 
hyperimmunoglobulin, polyclonal intravenous immunoglobulin, cytomegalovirus hyperimmunoglobulin, 
varicella zoster hyperimmunoglobulin). 
6. Previous enrollment in this program. 
Study population: 
Starting on 22 October 2014 and ending on 20 February 2015, a total of 359 patients were enrolled in 
the study at 16 clinical sites in the Russian Federation. 
Treatments 
All participants received intramuscular injections of palivizumab according to a physicians' prescription 
and the local Russian label. The labeling recommends 1 month injection window between sequential 5 
palivizumab  IM  injections.  It  is  recommended  to  administer  the  first  injection  right  before  the 
anticipated  start  of  the  RSV  season.  Participants  could  receive  from  3  to  5  monthly  injections  of 
palivizumab during the 2014 – 2015 RSV season and duration of this program. 
Outcomes/endpoints: 
Primary endpoint: The proportion of infants among the study population who were hospitalized for LRTI 
with a positive laboratory diagnostic test for RSV from respiratory secretions or who died due to RSV 
infection confirmed by autopsy or clinical history and virologic evidence. 
Safety:  Spontaneously  reported  non-serious  Adverse  Events  (AEs)  and  serious  AE  through  the  study 
period.  
Statistical Methods: 
As  this  was  a  descriptive  study,  summary  statistics  are  provided.  The  Safety  Analysis  Set  (SAS) 
included  all  patients  who  signed  patient  authorization  form  to  participate  in  the  study  and  had  any 
collected data. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Starting on 22 October 2014 and ending on 20 February 2015, a total of 359 patients were enrolled in 
the study at 16 clinical sites in the Russian Federation. Overall, 86.9% (n = 312) of children received 
three or more planned injections of palivizumab 22.6% (n = 81) of children missed or had a delayed 
palivizumab injection of at least 10 days. Forty-two percent (n = 153) of patients completed the study. 
A high rate of non-compliance with the optimal schedule was seen: 22.6% of infants received at least 
one  palivizumab  injection  after  incorrect  dose  timing  (missed  or  delayed  for  more  than  10  days

injection).  More  than  half  of  patients  (57.4%)  discontinued  the  immunoprophylaxis  with  palivizumab 
prematurely, the main reason of early discontinuation was related to the lack of study drug. 
Baseline data 
Median  age  of  infants  enrolled  in  the  study  was  2.0  months  (range  from  0  to  21.0  months).  The 
numbers of males were 180 and females 179 patients. The patient population belonged predominantly 
to the white race (93.6%). 
Bronchopulmonary dysplasia was diagnosed in 148 (41.2%) infants; the median duration of diagnosis 
was 3.45 months with a range of 0 to 19.1 months. Congenital heart disease was found in 45 (12.5%) 
patients, median duration of diagnosis was 4.01 months with a range of 0.3 to 17.3 months. 
The mean gestational age of infants was 29.4 (± 3.0) weeks, the mean birth weight – 1.298 (± 0.473) 
kg.  The  majority  of  infants  (289  patients  or  80.5%)  required  resuscitation,  335  (93.3%)  of  patients 
were  admitted  to  neonatal  or  pediatric  intensive-care  unit  (NICU/PICU).  The  median  duration  of 
hospitalization to NICU/PICU was 26 days (range 1 to 137 days). Almost all patients (344 patients or 
95.8%) required assisted ventilation: continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) was required in 122 
(34.0%)  infants,  mechanical  ventilation  –  in  84  (23.4%)  infants,  combined  method  (CPAP  and 
mechanical  ventilation)  was  used  most  often  –  in  138  (38.4%)  patients.  Surfactant  was  used  in  the 
majority of patients (265 patients or 73.8%). 
Efficacy results 
Overall, 86.9% (n = 312) of children received three or more planned injections of palivizumab. 22.6% 
(n  =  81)  of  children  missed  or  had  a  delayed  palivizumab  injection  of  at  least  10  days.  Forty-two 
percent (n = 153) of patients completed the study. 
In  total,  12  hospitalizations  due  to  LRTI  were  reported  during  the  study  among  11  patients  (3.1%; 
95% CI 1.5, 5.4). 
A RSV diagnostic test was performed in 9 of the 11 cases of LRTI hospitalization. 
Subsequently, one case of RSV positive LRTI was detected, resulting in a RSV LRTI hospitalization rate 
of  0.3%  (1/359).  The  infant  hospitalized  for  RSV  positive  LRTI  was  born  prematurely  (27  weeks 
gestational age) and was diagnosed with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. 
The  patient  received  3  injections  of  palivizumab,  the  last  injection  was  received  15  days  before 
hospitalization. The duration of the RSV-positive hospitalization was 46 days, including 35 days in the 
ICU. The RSV-positive pneumonia resolved in this patient. 
Safety results 
Forty-one  treatment  emergent  adverse  events  (AEs)  were  reported  in  19  of  359  (5.3%)  subjects 
through  30  days  following  the  last  observation  visit.  No  AE  led  to  discontinuation  of  palivizumab.  No 
AEs  exceeded  a  5  %  frequency  threshold.  The  most  common  AE  was  viral  respiratory  tract  infection 
with a rate of 1.9% (n = 7) followed by bronchitis (1.4%, n = 5) and pneumonia (1.4%, n = 5). 
Nine  AEs  in  3  subjects  (0.8%)  were  assessed  as  possibly  related  to  palivizumab  and  included 
bronchopneumonia,  pneumonia,  viral  respiratory  tract  infection,  apnoea,  BPD,  dyspnea,  cough, 
decreased appetite and lethargy. 
Thirty-three serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported among 17 (4.7%) subjects through 30 days 
following  the  last  observation  visit.  The  most  frequent  SAE  were  pneumonia  (7  or  2.0%  of  patients), 
viral respiratory tract infection (6 or 1.7% of patients) and bronchitis (5 or 1.4% of patients). 4 (1.1%) 
patients  with  combined  pathology  died  during  the  study,  two  of  them  had  pneumonia.  No  cases  of 
death due to RSV infection were reported in this study.

1.3.2.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In  this  postmarketing  observational  study,  the  hospitalization  rate  for  LRTI  was  low  with  12  LRTI 
reported among 11 of 359 infants (3.1%, 95% CI 1.5-5.4%). These data is based on a small Russian 
population,  since  more  than  half  of  the  enrolled  subjects  did  not  complete  the  study  and  since  many 
children either missed or had delayed injections due to shortage of palivizumab. Only a single case of 
confirmed RSV LRTI  hospitalization among the 359 patients was observed (0.3%). As regards safety, 
the  overall  safety  data  was  consistent  with  the  safety  profile  previously  established  for  palivizumab; 
few drug related AE were observed and no AE led to the discontinuation of palivizumab.  
2.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Synagis is already approved. 
The P14-579 Russian observational study in Russia was a supportive study, which aimed to assess the 
RSV-associated LRTI rate, deaths and safety in a “real world” target population for palivizumab.  
The study has several important limitations: 
A  high  percentage  of  the  enrolled  infants-  58%  (n=206)  did  not  complete  the  study.  Notably,  23% 
(n=81)  of  the  children  missed  or  had  delayed  palivizumab  injections  of  at  least  10  days.  The  main 
cause  for  the  early  discontinuations  was  lack  of  palivizumab,  which  occurred  in  185  (90%)  of  these 
cases. However, no patients discontinued study participation due to adverse events. 
A single hospitalization of patient with confirmed positive RSV was reported. However, in only 8 of the 
12 hospitalizations due to LRTI a RSV diagnostic test was done. Among these, 8 patients were tested 
by  a  rapid  antigen  test  system  and  in  one  patient  the  laboratory  test  system  was  not  specified. 
Palivizumab  may  directly  interfere  with  immune-based  RSV  diagnostic  tests,  such  as  the  antigen 
detection-based  assay  used  in  the  study.  An  important  limitation  for  the  study  is  therefore  that  the 
RSV-related  hospitalization  in  reality  may  have  been  higher,  since    4  of  the  12  hospitalized  infants 
were not RSV-tested and the diagnostic tests may have been false-negative.  
With these important limitations, it is hard to interpret the study. However, even with these limitations, 
the  findings  from  this  observational  study  seem  overall  consistent  with  the  established  efficacy  and 
safety of palivizumab. The results from study p14-579 submitted in accordance with article 46 of the 
Pediatric  Regulation  are  in  agreement  with  the  currently  approved  SMPC  and  no  further  regulatory 
action is deemed necessary.  
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

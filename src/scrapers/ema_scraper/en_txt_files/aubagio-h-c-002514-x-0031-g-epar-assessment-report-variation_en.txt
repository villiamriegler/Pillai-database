Sanofi-Aventis groupe submitted on 28 April 2020 a group of variation(s) consisting of an extension of 
the marketing authorisation and the following variation: 
Variation(s) requested 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
C.I.6.a  -  Change(s)  to  therapeutic  indication(s)  -  Addition  of  a  new 
II 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
Extension of a marketing authorisation for Aubagio to add a new strength, 7 mg film-coated tablet,  for 
use in paediatric patients from 10 years of age and older with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (MS). 
Extension of indication to include treatment of paediatric patients aged 10 years and older with relapsing 
remitting multiple sclerosis (MS) for Aubagio. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 
5.3 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet and Labelling are updated in accordance. 
The  MAH  is  requesting  an  extension  of  the  market  protection  of  one  additional  year  in  line  with  the 
guidance  on  elements  required  to  support  the  significant  clinical  benefit  in  comparison  with  existing 
therapies  of  a  new  therapeutic  indication  in  order  to  benefit  from  an  extended  (11-year)  marketing 
protection period. 
Version 6.0 of the RMP has also been submitted. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 and Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 
1234/2008, (2) point (c) - Extensions of marketing authorisations 
Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 – Group of variations 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant  to  Article  8  of  Regulation  (EC)  No  1901/2006,  the  application  included  an  EMA  Decision(s) 
P/0165/2017 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At  the  time  of  submission  of  the  application,  the  PIP  P/0165/2017  was  not  yet  completed  as  some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000,  the  MAH  did  not  submit  a  critical  report  addressing  the  possible  similarity  with  authorised 
orphan  medicinal  products  because  there  is  no  authorised  orphan  medicinal  product  for  a  condition 
related to the proposed indication.

Additional Data exclusivity/Marketing protection 
The MAH requested consideration of one-year marketing protection in regards of its application for a new 
indication in accordance with Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) 726/2004. 
Scientific advice 
The Applicant received the following Scientific Advice (SA) on the development relevant for the indication 
subject to the present application:

SAWP co-ordinators 
Fernando de Andrés Trelles 
Mario Miguel Rosa 
EMEA/H/SA/514/2/2016/PED/II seek advice regarding data to be submitted in support of a request to 
extend the current indication by adding treatment of paediatric patients. Further the Applicant asked for 
clarification how an additional year of market protection could be justified provided that an indication for 
the paediatric population was to be granted and considered a “new indication”. A new indication would 
normally  include  an  extended  target  population  for  the  same  disease,  e.g.  based  on  a  different  age 
range. As such, based on a positive benefit-risk balance, granting of an indication in 10-17 Years old 
RRMS patients would likely be regarded as a new indication. In order to benefit from an extended (11-
year) marketing protection period a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies of a 
new  therapeutic  indication  is  needed.  However,  whether  this  is  considered  to  be  fulfilled  can  only  be 
assessed  at  the  time  of  submission,  depending  on  the  existence  or  non-existence  of  other  approved 
products.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Paediatric MS is a severe chronic, immune-mediated neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous 
system  (CNS),  characterized  by  inflammation,  demyelination,  and  axonal/neuronal  destruction,  with 
marked impact on patients’ life and development, and leading to disability early in life. Although MS is 
predominantly a disease of young adults, approximately 3% to 5% of people with MS have their first 
symptoms in childhood. Genetic, serum, Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and cell-based studies largely support 
a  shared  biology  between  paediatric-onset  and  adult-onset  disease.  Relapses  are  more  frequent  in 
patients with paediatric-onset compared with adult-onset MS. Cognitive impairment in paediatric patients 
with multiple sclerosis and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evidence of global and focal loss of age-
expected brain volume have been described. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Approximately  3-5%  of  all  patients  with  MS  experience  their  first  attack  before  the  age  of  18  years 
(Belman  et  al.  2016).  MS  onset  before  10  years  of  age  is  rare  with  less  than  1%  of  MS  patients 
experiencing their first attack before the age of 10. Hence, the overall prevalence estimates for paediatric 
MS are low, ranging from 0.07 to 2.9 per 100,000 (Gadoth 2003, Pohl et al. 2007, Renoux et al. 2007, 
Chitnis et al. 2009, Waldman et al. 2016). 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
While the exact aetiology of MS remains unknown, it is generally assumed that MS is mediated by an 
immune-mediated inflammatory process that is triggered by environmental factors and superimposed 
on a genetic predisposition. The major contributors to this process are macrophages and microglia from 
the  innate  immune  system,  and  T  and  B  lymphocytes  from  the  adaptive  immune  system.  From  the 
peripheral immune system, autoreactive T-helper cells are primed and stimulated to infiltrate the CNS 
where they target myelin antigens. Inflammation of the white and grey matter tissues in the CNS due to 
focal immune cell infiltration and release of cytokines are the incipient cause of tissue damage in MS not

Page 8/109 
 
 
 
 
 
only to the myelin sheath but also to the underlying axons. This process happens over time and results 
in repeated attacks. Demyelination and axonal damage impairs or interrupts nerve transmission, giving 
rise to clinical signs and symptoms. B and T cells, monocytes, natural killer cells and dendritic cells are 
all  involved  in  any  stage  of  MS.  Neuropathology  studies  have  found  that  the  patterns  of  focal 
inflammation are very similar between relapsing and progressive MS. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
As in adults, a diagnosis of MS in paediatric patients is made based on clinical and MRI features. According 
to  the  consensus  definition  proposed  by  the  International  Paediatric  Multiple  Sclerosis  Study  Group 
(IPMSSG),  a  diagnosis  of  MS  in  paediatric  patients  requires  multiple  episodes  of  CNS  demyelination 
separated  in  time  and  space  (Krupp  et  al  2013).  Symptomatic  overlap  with  Acute  disseminated 
encephalomyelitis  (ADEM)  and  the  increased  chance  of  leukodystrophies  and  metabolic  disorders, 
complicates the differential diagnosis of paediatric-onset MS relative to adult onset MS (Venkateswaran 
and Banwell 2010, Krupp et al. 2013). 
The initial course of MS is more often relapsing (-remitting) in paediatric onset MS (>98%) than in adult 
onset (approximately 85%) (Waldman et al. 2016). The relapse rate in paediatric MS is reported to be 
2-3 times higher than in adult onset MS (Weinshenker et al. 1989a, Weinshenker et al. 1989b, Trojano 
et  al.  2002,  Yeh  et  al.  2009,  Benson  et  al.  2014,  Waldman  et  al.  2016).  Although  MRI  features  in 
paediatric  MS  are  less  well  described,  available  data  show  that  the  underlying  pathology  is  similar  to 
adult relapsing MS (RMS). Children, however, tend to have a higher number of T2 lesions at the time of 
first  event  than  adults  (Waubant  et  al.  2009)  and  a  lower  propensity  for  lesions  to  enhance  with 
gadolinium (Gd) (Banwell et al. 2007). A consistent finding in most of the paediatric cohort studies is 
lower disability scores in paediatric MS compared to adult MS, even when disease duration is taken into 
account. In the paediatric cohort described by (Renoux et al. 2007), the estimated median times from 
onset to the assignment of disability status scale scores of 4, 6 and 7 were 20 years, 29 years and 37 
years, respectively. Compared to the adult-onset population, the time to expanded disability status scale 
(EDSS) scores of 4, 6 and 7 were approximately 10 years longer for patients with childhood onset MS. 
Similarly, and in line with this slower progression of disability, the conversion to secondary progressive 
MS (SPMS) took approximately 10 years longer in paediatric MS than in adult patients, occurring at a 
median  of  28.1  years  after  the  first  attack  of  paediatric  MS  compared  to  18.8  years  for  adult-onset 
patients. The median age of the person at SPMS onset was 41 years in paediatric patients with MS vs. 
52 years in adult MS (~10 years earlier in paediatric patients vs adult MS). 
Paediatric MS accounts for approximately 3% to 5% of MS cases1-8 and the incidence increases with age 
(the majority of cases occur at or after the age of 10 years). The high number of relapses in the first 
years of the disease and the high frequency of paediatric patients with the relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) 
course  suggest  that  the  inflammatory  process  is  more  pronounced  in  children  with  MS  compared  to 
adults9-11. 
In paediatric patients with MS, current consensus is to initiate pharmacological treatment shortly after 
diagnosis,  even  though  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  most  therapies  available  for  adults  have  not  been 
formally demonstrated in children12-13. 
2.1.5.  Management 
As of the date of this document, only fingolimod has been explicitly approved in the EU for use in children 
aged 10 years and older with highly active RRMS.

Conventional first-line therapies for the treatment of RRMS include interferon-beta (two interferon-beta 
1a  and  one  interferon-beta  1b)  and  glatiramer  acetate,  which  are  self-injectable  disease-modifying 
therapies (DMTs). These are commonly used to treat paediatric MS as their indications (section 4.1 of 
the Summary of Product Characteristics [SmPC]) do not have an age limit and therefore formally include 
children. No controlled paediatric trials have been performed with interferons and glatiramer acetate and 
safety and efficacy solely rely on small retrospective observational studies.14-16

About the product 
Teriflunomide  is  an  immunomodulatory  agent  with  anti-inflammatory  properties  that  selectively  and 
reversibly inhibits the mitochondrial enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHO-DH), required for the 
de novo pyrimidine synthesis. As a consequence, teriflunomide blocks the activation and proliferation of 
rapidly dividing cells including activated lymphocytes which depend on de novo synthesis of pyrimidine 
to expand. Slowly dividing or resting cells which rely on the salvage pathway for pyrimidine synthesis 
are claimed to be unaffected by teriflunomide. The exact mechanism by which teriflunomide exerts its 
therapeutic effect in MS is not fully understood, but likely includes the reduction of activated lymphocytes 
available to migrate into the CNS. 
Teriflunomide is the active metabolite of leflunomide (Arava) indicated for rheumatoid arthritis and for 
psoriatic  arthritis.  In  vivo,  leflunomide  is  rapidly  and  almost  completely  metabolised  to  teriflunomide 
which is active in vitro and is presumed to be responsible for the therapeutic effect of Arava. 
In this procedure,  the  Applicant  proposed  to extend the Aubagio  indication  as follows  : "treatment of 
adult patients and paediatric patients aged 10 years and older with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis 
(MS)" and to add a new paediatric formulation as a new 7 mg strength film-coated tablet. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The Applicant submitted the following grouping of variations according to article 7.2 (b) of the variation 
regulation  (cases  for  grouping  variations  listed  in  Annex  III  to  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No 
1234/2008): 
•  New strength: Extension of a marketing authorization under Annex I to Commission Regulation (EC) 
No 1234/2008 for teriflunomide 7 mg film-coated tablet 
•  New paediatric indication: Type II variation as defined in Article 2(3) of Commission Regulation (EC) 
No 1234/2008 for a new therapeutic indication. The Applicant is seeking approval for an indication 
in  paediatric  patients  from  10  years  of  age  and  older  with  relapsing  remitting  multiple  sclerosis 
indication under Article 8 of Paediatric Regulation 1901/2006.

The Applicant requested consideration of one-year marketing protection in regards of its application for 
a new indication in the framework of Aubagio procedure EMEA/H/C/002514/X/0031/G in accordance with 
Article  14(11)  of  Regulation  (EC)  726/2004.  The  CHMP  assessment  report  on  the  significant  clinical 
benefit in  comparison with existing therapies in accordance with Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004 is appended in this CHMP AR.  
Centralised scientific advice was given by the CHMP on 26 May 2016 (EMEA/H/SA/514/2/2016/PED/II) 
regarding the data to be submitted in support of a request to extend the current indication by adding 
treatment of paediatric patients. Further the Applicant asked for clarification how an additional year of 
market protection could be justified provided that an indication for the paediatric population was to be 
granted and considered a “new indication”. A new indication would normally include an extended target 
population  for  the  same  disease,  e.g.  based  on  a  different  age  range.  As  such,  based  on  a  positive 
benefit-risk balance, granting of an indication in 10-17 Years old RRMS patients would likely be regarded 
as  a  new  indication.  In  order  to  benefit  from  an  extended  (11-year)  marketing  protection  period  a 
significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies of a new therapeutic indication is needed. 
However,  whether  this  is  considered  to  be  fulfilled  can  only  be  assessed  at  the  time  of  submission, 
depending on the existence or non-existence of other approved products. 
A  pre-submission  meeting  was  held  with  the  Rapporteur  on  03  February  2020,  focussing  on  the 
acceptability of the data, e.g. the results for the primary endpoint and the role of sensitivity analyses 
(relapses and high MRI activity) in the context of a more frequent than anticipated switch from double-
blind (DB) study drug to open-label (OL) treatment due to high MRI activity. Further discussions related 
to the dosage regimen in particular for paediatric patients ≤40 kg (14 mg tablet every-other-day, or 7 
mg tablet every day), the justification for significant clinical benefit to obtain an extension of marketing 
protection (+1 year) and the risk management approach. 
An additional pre-submission was held with the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 05 February 2020 
to obtain procedural and regulatory advices in anticipation of a submission planned on 4 May (extension 
and Type II) or 3 June 2020 (in the case of a Type II variation), e.g. due to the additional submission of 
the 7 mg dosage. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 7 mg of teriflunomide as active 
substance. The 7 mg strength is newly introduced with this line extension to the already approved 14 
mg strength presentation together with an extension of the indication to paediatric patients. 
Other ingredients are:  
Tablet core: lactose monohydrate, maize starch, microcrystalline cellulose, sodium starch glycolate 
(Type A), hydroxypropylcellulose and magnesium stearate. 
Tablet coating: hypromellose, titanium dioxide (E171), talc, macrogol 8000, indigo carmine aluminium 
lake (E132), iron oxide yellow (E172; only for the 7 mg strength). 
The product is available in polyamide/aluminium/poly(vinyl chloride) -aluminium blisters inserted in 
wallets and packed in a carton as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The active substance (teriflunomide) is the same as for the authorised Aubagio 14 mg film-coated 
tablets. No new data on the active substance was provided with this line extension application. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The medicinal product is an immediate release film-coated tablet. The 7 mg tablet strength is 
presented as a very light greenish-blueish grey to pale greenish-blue, hexagonal film-coated tablet 
with imprint of dosage strength (‘7’) on one side and engraved with a corporate logo on the other side.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards, except for the colourants which comply with the relevant Directive 2008/128/EC. The choice 
and the amount of colourant has been thoroughly justified with view of the paediatric indication. There 
are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in 
section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The aim of formulation development was to manufacture an additional lower-strength film-coated 
tablet. The existing 14 mg strength and the new 7 mg and strength are both pharmaceutical forms for 
use in paediatric patients from 10 years of age or older. 
The newly introduced 7 mg strength was developed together with the already approved 14 mg 
strength. The composition of the tablet core is qualitatively identical to the 14 mg strength.  
The two tablet strengths are sufficiently visually distinguishable by their debossing and colour. 
The development of the product, which included manufacturing process and dissolution method 
developments, has been described. 
The same critical quality attributes (CQAs) as for the approved 14 mg strength apply. 
Film-coating was developed for aesthetic reasons and to improve the patients’ ability to swallow 
the tablet. 
A detailed summary containing all formulation changes performed during development and their effect 
on the 7 mg and 14 mg film-coated tablets has been provided. The overview includes additional 
strength not intended for commercialisation. 
The primary packaging consists of polyamide/aluminium/poly(vinyl chloride) -aluminium blisters and is 
the same as for the existing 14 mg tablets.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The 7 mg film-coated tablets are manufactured by Sanofi Winthrop Industrie, France, using a batch 
manufacturing process which involves mixing, fluid-bed granulation, drying, sieving, mixing and 
lubrication, tableting and film-coating. The manufacturer used for the 7 mg strength is already 
approved for the 14 mg strength tablets and the manufacturing process is similar for the 7 mg and 14 
mg strength. The batch size is identical for both strengths. 
An adequate criticality analysis was performed as part of the pharmaceutical development. Sufficient 
information on the control of critical steps has been provided in the dossier and the in-process 
acceptance limits have been justified. The overall control strategy, process parameters and in-process 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289596/2021  
Page 12/109 
 
 
 
 
controls seem adequate in view of the available development data and in view of the standard nature 
of the manufacturing process. 
Process validation results from three full scale batches indicate that the manufacturing process is 
capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for appearance (visual), 
identification (HPLC, UV), assay (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), 
uniformity of dosage units (HPLC), water content (KF) and microbial contamination (Ph. Eur.). The 
proposed specifications include all required tests relevant for this dosage form. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines and have shown to be stability-indicating. Appropriate data have 
been presented to justify the release specifications for each quality characteristic that is controlled. The 
limits for the dissolution test are justified.  
A summary of the risk assessment for elemental impurities of the 7 mg strength has been provided. 
The outcome indicates that all findings were below the control threshold and the therefore the existing 
control strategies are sufficient. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three production-scale batches confirming the consistency of 
the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three production scale batches of finished product stored for up to 36 months under 
long-term storage conditions (30±2°C/65±5%RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated storage 
conditions (40±2°C/75±5%RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The stability batches 
are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for 
marketing.  
Overall no significant tendencies in any of the parameters tested were observed. 
Samples of production scale batches were exposed to light in line with the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. No changes regarding the assay, the 
individual impurities as well as the total impurities occurred. 
The stability results presented are satisfactory and support the proposed shelf life of 3 years without 
special storage conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3). 
Adventitious agents 
The only excipient of animal origin used for the manufacture of the finished product is lactose 
monohydrate. It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same 
condition as those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared 
without the use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on 
Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and 
veterinary medicinal products.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The newly introduced 7 mg strength tablet is very similar to the already authorised 14 mg tablet 
strength in composition, way of manufacture, batch size and quality attributes.  
The decreased amount of active substance is compensated by the amount of excipients, resulting in 
film-coated tablets of identical weight. Information on development, manufacture and control of the 
finished product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development

2.3.3.  Toxicology 
As part of an earlier PIP requirement to support clinical development of teriflunomide in paediatric RRMS 
patients aged 10 years or above (EMA decision P/209/2011; EMA/643565/2011), a 2 weeks exploratory 
dose-range  finding  study  in  postnatal  day  (PND)  21  juvenile  rats  (study  no.  JUP0014)  was  assessed 
during original MA of teriflunomide, whereas the pivotal 7 weeks repeated-dose juvenile toxicity study 
in  PND21  juvenile  rats  (study  no.  JUV0024)  was  more  recently  evaluated  and  approved  by  Type  II 
variation on 26th April 2019 (EMEA/H/C/2514/II/22). 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Teriflunomide  PECsurfacewater  value  is  below  the  action  limit  of  0.01  µg/L  and  is  not  a  Persistent, 
Bioaccumulative  and  Toxic  (PBT)  substance  as  log  Kow  does  not  exceed  4.5.  Therefore,  the 
environmental risk assessment stops in Phase I. It is assumed that teriflunomide is unlikely to represent 
a risk for the environment following its prescribed usage in patients.

2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The juvenile toxicity studies, which aimed to support the extension of the MA to paediatric RRMS patients 
aged  10 years  and  above,  have  been  earlier  performed  and  approved  by  the  CHMP.  Corresponding 
findings from these juvenile toxicity studies have been adequately implemented into section 5.3 of the 
SmPC.  In  addition,  dedicated  instructions  regarding  the  use  of  teriflunomide  by  female  adolescents 
becoming  fertile  have  been  implemented  into  the  SmPC  and  PL  in  accordance  with  recent  PRAC 
discussions. 
Moreover,  the proposed  extension of  the MA  will  not increase the environmental  risk  of teriflunomide 
following its prescribed usage in paediatric RRMS patients. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Approval of the extension of the MA of teriflunomide can be considered from a non-clinical point of 
view.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic (PK) data in children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age (at the initial entry to the 
study)  were  collected  during  the  completed  DB  period  and  the  ongoing  OL  period  of  Study 
EFC11759/TERIKIDS.  In  this  study,  patients  were  treated  with  either  7  mg  teriflunomide  or  14  mg 
teriflunomide once daily, after they had completed  an 8-week PK run-in phase, to reach steady state 
exposure similar to that seen in adults treated with the approved dose of teriflunomide 14 mg once daily. 
In absence of prior PK data in children, patients who were to initiate teriflunomide treatment started the 
PK run-in phase on half the predicted dose with either 3.5 mg (body weight [BW]≤ 40 kg) or 7 mg (BW 
>40 kg) teriflunomide once daily. Pre-dose PK samples were collected during PK run-in phase (at Week 
2, 3, and 4), at Week 8 (end of PK run-in phase), 12, 24 and 36, and at end of treatment (EOT) for both 
the DB and OL periods. Only trough level plasma concentrations were measured. 
At Week 36, mean (standard deviation (SD)) steady state plasma concentrations were 53.1 (25.3) μg/mL 
in the 7 mg teriflunomide group and 67.8 (41.7) μg/mL in the 14 mg teriflunomide group. Considering 
high variability and small numbers in the 7 mg group, no major differences in teriflunomide steady-state 
trough  concentrations  were  observed  after  7  mg  and  14  mg  once  daily  as  expected  due  to  dose 
adjustment to the 14 mg adult-equivalent dose at the end of the PK run-in phase. 
The overall aim of the paediatric popPK model development was to support definition of the daily dose 
to be administered to reach similar exposure in paediatric patients as in adults being treated with 14 mg 
once daily. Model development was only performed on an interim paediatric database. 
The  goodness-of-fit  plots  showed  a  limited  performance  of  the  population  model  predictions  with  an 
important tendency to underpredict high concentration values. In addition, estimation of absorption rate 
constant was unrealistic thus leading to unreliable estimations of exposure parameters. Upon request, 
the  dataset  was  enlarged  with  the  five  patients  and  409  concentration-time  points  coming  from  the 
ongoing  OL  period.  Therefore,  the  updated  dataset  was  composed  of  159  patients  providing  1686 
concentration-time points. In the popPK model the absorption rate constant was adjusted to the adult 
value as proposed. The proposed every-other-day dosing regimen was not supported since no data are 
available with this dosing regimen, the model could not support this recommendation and this kind of 
regimen  is  prone  for  medication  errors.  During  the  procedure,  the  Applicant  presented  detailed 
comparisons  of  observed  data  between  paediatric  populations  and  the  whole  target  adult  population. 
Additional  information  on  the  model  development  was  provided  and  discussed  and  the  appropriate 
depiction of the population prediction goodness-of-fit plot presented.  
Comparisons of individual exposures over the whole BW range investigated as well as grouped per 5 kg 
BW  bands  in  the  BW  range  between  40  –  60  kg  were  compared  to  the  whole  target  adult  reference 
range. With the available dataset there is no clear pattern of higher exposure in the lighter BW bands in 
the range between 40 and 60 kg. Therefore, the proposed BW cut-off at 40 kg for the same dose as in 
adults  is  considered  acceptable.  In  addition,  the  frequency  of  Treatment-Emergent  Adverse  Events 
(TEAEs),  their  maximum  intensity  and  outcome  after  occurrence  of  TEAEs  did  not  show  any  specific 
pattern with respect to height of exposure. 
Additional information was given on the 13 paediatric patients BW>40 kg treated with 7 mg instead of 
14  mg  in  the  paediatric  study.  In  a  situation  where  they  would  have  received  14  mg  once  daily, 
simulations showed that all would have had a steady state exposure included in the range observed in 
the adult patients under steady state with 14 mg once daily with only 1 patient who would have had 
Ctrough  exceeding  the  95th  percentile  but  below  the  maximum  value.  No  demographic  or  baseline 
characteristic known to impact on PK parameters could explain the higher exposures in this patient. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289596/2021  
Page 17/109 
 
 
 
 
Overall,  the  observed  Ctrough  values  are  highly  variable  between  paediatric  individuals.  They  range 
between 3.9 to 232 µg/ml, comparable to the range seen in adults (range 0.68 to 239 µg/ml). There are 
some patients who exhibit very high trough concentrations. With the presented popPK analyses, some 
factors were identified which decreased clearance, such as high albumin, high bilirubin concentration, 
and female sex, thus leading to higher plasma concentrations. But no factor was considered to clinically 
relevantly influence PK. It might also be a combined influence of different factors. 
As  requested,  the  exposure  in  paediatric  patients  developing  pancreatitis  was  further  investigated. 
Exposure in these patients were within the ranges of exposure in the other paediatric patients and adults. 
No clear statement can be drawn with the few and variable data available. Nevertheless, it is considered 
that  physicians  should  be  made  aware  of  the  high  variability  in  exposure.  Therefore,  an  additional 
statement  should  be  included  in  the  SmPC  section  5.2.  in  the  subsection  on  Paediatric  Population: 
“Overall, observed trough concentrations were highly variable between individuals (Ctrough range between 
3.9 and 232 µg/ml).”  
Different points were provided and discussed in order to support dosing in paediatric patients below or 
equal to 40 kg BW. Bias for individual predictions (IPRED) was below 10%. The revised presentation of 
the population predictions versus observed concentrations showed that in the appropriate depiction, the 
regression  line  better  suited  the  line  of  identity.  This  increases  confidence  in  model  performance. 
Comparison of individual observed exposures between paediatric subgroups (below and above 40 kg) 
and the whole adult reference group showed that paediatric exposure was in the same range as in the 
adult population. Simulations based on the updated paediatric model (including a “worst case scenario” 
of patients weighing 25 kg corresponding to the 5th percentile of 10-year-old children) confirmed the 
assumption that with the proposed dosing, exposure in paediatrics will match the adult reference range.  
Overall,  the  BW  cut-off  of  40  kg  for  the  same  dose  as  in  adults  (14  mg)  is  accepted  as  well  as  the 
proposed dose of 7 mg in paediatric patients equal or below 40 kg. The proposed 14 mg every other day 
dosing for patients weighing below 40 kg has been withdrawn by the Applicant.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new data were presented by the Applicant. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK of teriflunomide in children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age was assessed using descriptive 
statistics  on  trough  plasma  samples  collected  in  Study  EFC11759/TERIKIDS.  Additionally,  a  popPK 
analysis  was  conducted  with  data  from  DB  and  OL  periods  and  compared  paediatric  exposures  for 
patients with BW >40 kg and ≤40 kg with exposures documented in adult patients. 
No major differences in teriflunomide steady-state trough concentrations were observed after 7 mg and 
14 mg once daily as expected due to dose adjustment to the 14 mg adult-equivalent dose at the end of 
the PK run-in phase. 
The presented paediatric population PK model had been based on an interim paediatric database only, 
which had severe limitations. Upon request, the Applicant provided an updated popPK model, which now 
includes all available data. The newly provided evidence on the quality of the model further increases 
the confidence in the updated paediatric model. Overall, including all available data on PK and safety 
and support by the model, the proposed BW cut-off is considered acceptable as well as the proposed 
dose  of  7  mg  for  patients  equal  or  below  40  kg.  Nevertheless,  it  is  considered  necessary  to  make 
physicians aware of the highly variable exposure, which, at present, cannot be explained by individual 
patient characteristics. In this respect, an additional SmPC statement is added.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
With  the  updated  model  and  depiction  of  exposure  in  different  BW  bands,  no  clear  pattern  of  higher 
exposure in patients with lower BW in the BW range between 40 and 60 kg could be retrieved. In addition, 
no clear correlation between  exposure and safety  issues was  found.  With the updated information  on 
model quality, confidence in model performance was increased. Therefore, overall, proposed dosing in 
paediatrics is considered acceptable. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
No dedicated dose response study in the paediatric population was conducted.  
Study  EFC11759  included  at  beginning  a  blinded  PK  run-in  for  the  first  8  weeks  after  randomization, 
during which patients received placebo, or half of their target dose, e.g. 3.5 mg teriflunomide daily for 
patients ≤40 kg, or 7 mg teriflunomide daily for patients >40 kg. It was anticipated that this would result 
in an exposure similar to adults being treated with 7 mg teriflunomide daily (the “7 mg adult equivalent 
dose”). After the end of the PK run-in phase, a 14 mg adult equivalent once daily dose (14 mg has been 
approved for the adult RRMS patient population) of teriflunomide based on BW or matching placebo was 
administered per day. According to a popPK analysis, the Applicant considered, that a dosage of 14 mg 
teriflunomide once daily would be appropriate for paediatric patients with a BW>40 kg, and a dose of 7 
mg teriflunomide once daily or 14 mg teriflunomide every-other-day for paediatric patients with a BW≤40 
kg. No patient was adjusted to the 3.5 mg once daily dose during the PK run-in phase. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
Study EFC11759 (study TERIKIDS) 
Methods 
A  two-year, multicenter,  randomized,  DB,  placebo-controlled,  parallel group  trial  to evaluate efficacy, 
safety, tolerability, and PK of teriflunomide administered orally once daily in paediatric patients with RMS 
followed by an OL extension.  
The study consisted of the following periods: 
• 
• 
a screening period up to 4 weeks,  
followed  by  a  DB  treatment  period  of  up  to  96  weeks  total  duration  for  each  patient  after 
randomization, that included a blinded PK run-in phase of 8 weeks. The PK run-in phase was intended 
to provide individual PK parameters to allow dose adjustment to ensure that patients randomized to 
receive teriflunomide would reach an exposure similar to that observed in adults treated with 14 mg 
once daily (“the 14 mg adult-equivalent dose”) for the rest of the study from Week 8. Patients who 
experienced a relapse after the PK run-in phase (8 weeks) confirmed by the Relapse Adjudication 
Panel  (RAP)  had  the  option  to  switch  to  the  OL  period.  Similarly,  patients  with  high  MRI  activity 
according  to  strict  definitions  could  switch  to  the  OL  period.  Patients  completing  the  96-week  DB 
period had the option to continue in the OL period. 
•  An OL period for the remainder of 192 weeks after randomization. The OL period that followed the 
DB period lasted until 192 weeks after randomization. Its duration for a given patient depended on 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289596/2021  
Page 19/109 
 
 
 
 
when the patient entered this period. The duration of the OL period was going to be 96 weeks for 
patients completing the 96-week DB period on treatment, and longer for patients switching to OL 
during the initial 96-week DB period at the occurrence of a confirmed relapse or in case of high MRI 
activity. All patients entering the OL period from the placebo arm or teriflunomide arm, repeated a 
second  8  weeks  PK  run-in  phase.  Placebo  patients  would  initiate  teriflunomide  treatment  when 
entering the PK run-in of the OL period, while patients previously treated with teriflunomide during 
the DB period continued with the same previously adjusted dose. 
•  A follow-up period for patients who discontinued.  
•  An  optional  additional  extension  period  with  teriflunomide  offered  to  young  patients  when  they 
completed  the  study  to  provide  treatment  until  they  were  18  years  old  and/or  could  switch  to 
teriflunomide commercial product, whichever came first.  
The implementation of the placebo arm was combined with switch criteria, i.e. patients who experienced 
new disease activity had the option to move early to the OL teriflunomide treatment arm. With regard 
to high MRI activity, the criteria were defined as follows: In case of at least 5 new/enlarged T2 lesions 
at the MRI of Week 24 an additional MRI was performed at Week 36. In case the follow-up MRI revealed 
at least 9 new/enlarged T2 lesions at Week 36, or at least 5 new/enlarged T2 lesions on each of the 2 
consecutive  MRI  scans  at  Week  36  and  Week  48,  or,  at  Week 48  and  Week  72  then  the  patient  was 
qualified for early switch. 
Study Participants  
Main inclusion criteria relating to efficacy were RMS diagnosed based on the McDonald criteria 2010 and 
the IPMSSG criteria for paediatric MS, version of 2012, ages <18 years of age and ≥10 years of age at 
randomization, EDSS score ≤5.5, last relapse more than 30 days prior to randomization and meeting 
one of the following disease activity criteria: 
- at least one relapse (or attack) in the 12 months preceding screening or, 
- at least two relapses (or attack) in the 24 months preceding screening. 
Subjects could be MS-treatment naïve or could have received prior MS DMT. 
Treatments 
Teriflunomide  and  placebo  were  taken  orally  as  a  single  dose  each  day  of  the  treatment  periods. 
Investigational medical products (IMP) were taken with water and could be taken with or without food.  
During the PK run-in period, patients randomized to the active treatment group who had a BW of 30 ± 
10 kg received 1 tablet of 3.5 mg of teriflunomide daily, while patients with a BW of >40 kg received 1 
tablet of 7 mg teriflunomide daily. It was anticipated that this would result in an exposure similar to 
adults being treated with 7 mg teriflunomide daily (the “7 mg adult equivalent dose”).  
After  the  end  of  the  PK  run-in  phase,  a  14  mg  adult  equivalent  once  daily  dose  of  teriflunomide  or 
matching placebo was administered per day as follows, based on exposures predicted from PK samples 
collected up to Week 4 using a PopPK model with allometric scaling adapted to the paediatric population. 
Use of systemic corticosteroids for the treatment of MS relapse was allowed during the study in doses 
appropriate for the paediatric population based on the investigator’s decision.

Objectives 
The  primary  objective  was  to  assess  the  effect  of  teriflunomide  in  comparison  to  placebo  on  disease 
activity as measured by time to first clinical relapse after randomization in children and adolescents 10 
to 17 years of age with RMS. 
Secondary objectives were 
• 
• 
• 
To assess the effect of teriflunomide in comparison to placebo on disease activity/progression 
measured by brain MRI and on cognitive function. 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of teriflunomide in comparison to placebo. 
To evaluate the PK of teriflunomide.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
• 
The time to first clinical relapse after randomization up to the end of DB treatment period. 
Relapses were defined as new or recurrent neurological symptoms not associated with fever or infection, 
lasting at least 24 hours, and accompanied by new objective neurological findings upon examination by 
the examining neurologist and documented by the Functional System Scores (FSSs), i.e. an increase of 
at least 1 point on any FSS score. During the procedure, the Applicant was requested to discuss the 
discrepancy  in  relation  to  the  definition  for  the  extent  of  EDSS  worsening  required  for  relapse 
confirmation used in the studies performed in the adult population (2 points in one FSS or one point in 
two FSS). The Applicant clarified that this was justified by the chosen process of relapse confirmation 
performed by an external panel (RAP). Further, the Applicant argues that in the context of the study 
design also paediatric patients with an increase of only 1 FSS point were given the opportunity to switch 
to active treatment in the OL period. The Applicant´s argumentation can be followed. New or recurrent 
symptoms that occurred less than 30 days following the onset of a relapse were considered part of the 
same  relapse.  Clinical  relapses  were  reviewed  for  confirmation  by  an  independent,  trained  RAP  in  a 
blinded fashion.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
• 
Proportion of clinical relapse-free patients at 24, 48, 72 and 96 weeks

MRI measurements were scheduled to be performed at Screening, and Weeks 24, 36 (optional for switch 
evaluation as needed), 48, 72 and 96/EOT in the DB period. For patients who experienced a relapse or 
high MRI activity during the DB period and switched to the OL teriflunomide extension, MRI assessments 
were scheduled at Weeks 48, 96, 144, and 192/EOT. 
While the study was ongoing, the Applicant requested a modification of the agreed PIP in November 
2018  parallel to interactions with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to propose to change the 
primary endpoint “time to clinical relapse”. At that time the study was fully enrolled but was still ongoing 
and it was noted that more patients (21 patients) than anticipated were switching to the OL period, 
many of them (14 patients) due to high MRI activity. Given the anticipated impact of these switchers 
on the primary analysis, the Applicant discussed to include high MRI activity switches, along with the 
confirmed clinical  relapses, in  a composite primary  endpoint, which  corresponded to one of  the pre-
planned sensitivity analyses. However, PDCO and the FDA did not agree to change the primary endpoint 
during  the  ongoing  study  due  to  the  study  being  far  advanced  and  advised  to  take  the  pre-planned 
sensitivity analyses into account when assessing the efficacy data of the study. During the procedure 
the request for modification was withdrawn.  
Sample size 
Determination of sample size was based on the primary efficacy endpoint, time to first confirmed clinical 
relapse after randomization, and assumption were based on combined data from the completed Phase 
III monotherapy adult studies (EFC6049/TEMSO and EFC10531/TOWER). 
Assuming 60% of placebo patients experience a relapse by 2 years, 165 children (110 teriflunomide and 
55 placebo) were needed for 80% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) (teriflunomide versus placebo) of 
0.5 (2-sided alpha 0.05). The 2-year rate of relapse in the teriflunomide group would be 36.8% and the 
corresponding  hazard  rates  (HR),  assuming  the  time-to-relapse  is  exponentially  distributed  with  a 
constant  HR,  would  be  0.4581  for  placebo  and  0.2291  for  teriflunomide.  The  sample  size  is  adjusted 
assuming 20% of patients discontinue the study in 2 years due to reasons other than relapse. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized 1:2 to placebo and teriflunomide stratified by country in which the patient is 
being  treated and  patient pubertal status.  This is  considered appropriate,  as according to the initially 
agreed PIP the study had to include pre-pubertal and pubertal MS patients. The randomization code list 
is generated by the interactive web response system and interactive voice response system (IWRS/IVRS) 
service provider. Patients fulfilling all inclusion and exclusion criteria at the Visit 1 (Day-28) and Visit 2 
(Day 0) are qualified for randomization. Randomization occurs at Visit 2. The first dose of randomized 
IMP (either teriflunomide or placebo) will be taken the same day or the following day. 
Blinding (masking) 
There were 2 neurologists at each study center:  
• 
The treating neurologist  was responsible for patient eligibility  evaluation, supervision of study 
medication administration, recording and treating of AEs and assessing relapses, and monitoring 
of  safety  assessments,  including  routine  laboratory  results  and  concomitant  medications. 
Throughout the study, the treating neurologist was to remain unaware of the patient’s treatment 
assignment.  The  same  physician  should,  as  best  as  possible,  maintain  the  role  of  treating 
neurologist for a given patient throughout the study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289596/2021  
Page 22/109 
 
 
 
 
• 
The  examining  neurologist,  independent  from  the  treating  neurologist,  was  responsible  for 
conducting all FSS and EDSS score assessments. The examining neurologist was to be certified 
for  EDSS  rating  prior  any  involvement  in  the  study.  Throughout  the  study,  the  examining 
neurologist was to remain unaware of the patient’s treatment assignment and the safety profile 
of the patient (AEs, concomitant medications, and laboratory results). 
All  brain  MRI  scans  were  reviewed  and  interpreted  independently  by  trained  neuro-radiologists  at  a 
central  facility  with  no  access  (ie,  blinded)  to  treatment  assignment  thereby  avoiding  bias.  An  MRI 
manual explaining the instructions for standard image acquisition requirements, data transfer, archiving 
and shipping, and outlining the phantom data approval process was provided to all centers. According 
to the provided Imaging Review Charter, the Gd-enhancing lesion count measurement was performed 
manual  by  two  qualified  MRI  readers.  All  other  quantitative  measurements  were  either  computer 
generated quantitative analysis with full expert review and oversight or human interfaced analysis using 
a boundary finding segmentation algorithm.  
Statistical methods 
Analysis Population 
Intent-to-treat  population  (ITT):  all  randomized  patients  analyzed  according  to  the  treatment  group 
allocated by randomization.  
Randomized  population:  all  patients  who  had  been  allocated  to  randomized  treatment  regardless  of 
whether the treatment kits were used. This was the population for analyses of demographics and baseline 
characteristics. 
Safety population: all randomized patients exposed to DB study medication, regardless of the amount of 
treatment administered.  
PK population: subset of the safety population containing patients who had at least one PK sample taken. 
The ITT population was the primary analysis population for efficacy analysis. In addition, analyses based 
on the per-protocol (PP) population were requested and conducted for completeness post-hoc, although 
it is acknowledged, that such analyses should be considered with caution (potentially biased). 
Analysis of primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary endpoint ‘time to first relapse’ can be considered as a surrogate of the analysis of the relapse 
rate,  which  could  be  adequate  assuming  a  constant  individual  relapse  intensity  over  time.  While  this 
assumption  may  only  be  valid  in  case  of  adherence  to  study  treatment,  the  analysis  of  time-to-first 
relapse can be considered as yielding the best available evidence on relapse, as patients were offered to 
switch to the active treatment following a relapse or high MRI activity.  
The primary analysis was a stratified log-rank test (stratification: region, pubertal status) using a two-
sided  alpha  level  of  5%.  The  first  confirmed  clinical  relapse  occurring  from  randomization  (including 
relapses  during  the  PK  run-in  phase)  to  the  end  of  the  DB  study  period  was  included  for  analysis. 
Treatment effect as measured by the HR and its associated 95% confidence interval (CI) were estimated 
using a Cox's proportional-hazards model (factors: treatment, region, pubertal status, age, number of 
relapses in the year prior to randomization).  
Patients were censored (1) at the time of permanent discontinuation of treatment/DB period, (2) at the 
time of discontinuing the DB period and switching to OL teriflunomide due to high MRI activity and (3) 
at week 96 (end of DB period) in case patients neither experienced a relapse nor high MRI activity. While 
the non-informative censoring assumption underlying the analysis may be valid for (3), validity of this 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289596/2021  
Page 23/109 
 
 
 
 
assumption is questionable in the other two cases, and additional analysis were required (see section on 
sensitivity analyses).  
Furthermore, as the proportional-hazard assumption is not fulfilled in this study, the HR is not a reliable 
effect measure: Focus should be on estimates of relapse probability at different time points. 
With regard to the mean times for time-to-event endpoints, restricted mean survival times (i.e. the mean 
time-to-event, “survival” is used as a technical term only), restricted to 96 weeks, were estimated. 
Sensitivity Analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint 
Six sensitivity analyses have been conducted using a similar analysis as for the primary endpoint. These 
analyses could have supported a significant primary analysis. However, given that the primary endpoint 
failed, formally no conclusions on efficacy can be made based on these analyses. All conclusions from 
this study must be considered as exploratory and descriptive.  
• 
Time to first confirmed clinical relapse or high MRI activity meeting protocol criteria for switching 
into  the  OL  period,  whichever  came  first,  after  randomization  before  the  treatment 
discontinuation/completion in the DB period.  
Counting high MRI activity as an event addresses the issue that censoring at time of stopping 
the  DB  period  due  to  high  MRI  activity  is  informative,  since  high  MRI  activity  is  related  to  a 
potential relapse. It can also be considered as addressing a composite endpoint. 
• 
Time to first clinical relapse (ie, clinical relapse confirmed or not by the RAP) after randomization 
before the treatment discontinuation/completion in the DB period. 
• 
Time to first confirmed clinical relapse occurring after the PK run-in (8 weeks) phase but before 
the treatment discontinuation/completion in the DB period.  
For this analysis  patients were censored at the  time of  relapse  during titration/PK  run-in  (i.e. 
non-informative  censoring  is  assumed),  which  is  likely  not  valid.  Regardless,  this  analysis 
provides little information on the use of teriflunomide without titration. Furthermore, no analysis 
to robustly derive this effect can reasonably be done. 
• 
Time  to  first  clinical  relapse  with  objective  signs  on  the  examining  neurologist’s  examination 
including  relapses  during  the  PK  run-in  phase  and  relapses  reported  after  the  study  drug 
discontinuation and up to 96 weeks after randomization. 
As  the  primary  analysis  employs  a  hypothetical  estimand  strategy  for  switching  to  OL 
teriflunomide  in  case  of  high  MRI  activity,  this  analysis  supports  the  primary  analysis  by 
addressing  an  estimand  based  on  the  treatment  policy  strategy  describing  the  effect  of 
immediate application of Teriflunomide vs that after high MRI activity.  
• 
Post-hoc: Time to high MRI activity for switching into the OL period. 
Interpretation of this analysis is limited, as patients experiencing a relapse are censored, but (a) 
censoring at time of relapse is clearly informative and (b) patients experiencing a relapse may 
have had a high MRI activity prior to relapse that was not detected due to limited MRIs.  
• 
Post-hoc: Time to first confirmed clinical relapse occurring after the PK run-in phase up to 96 
weeks after randomization including relapses reported in both DB and OL periods. 
The conducted sensitivity analyses do not address the issue of censoring patients at time of permanent 
and  premature  discontinuation  of  treatment/DB  period,  which  may  be  informative,  too.  A  sensitivity 
analysis using more reasonable assumptions to handle these discontinuations was therefore requested 
for  the  composite  ‘time  to  high  MRI  activity  or  relapse’.  Additionally,  interval  censoring  of  the  MRI 
component has been requested to be considered in an additional sensitivity analysis of the composite.

Subgroup Analyses for the Primary Endpoint 
Pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed based: Age group at study consent (<13, ≥13 years), 
gender, race, pubertal status (at study consent and at disease onset), baseline  BW group (≤40, >40 
kg), MS subtypes (RRMS, other forms), number of relapses experienced within past 1 year (0, 1, 2 and 
≥3), number of relapses experienced overall (0, 1, 2, 3 and ≥4), high disease activity at baseline (defined 
as 2 or more relapses in  past year, and 1 or more Gd-enhancing lesions on baseline MRI (Yes,  No)), 
Region (Europe, North America, Asia, Middle East, North Africa) and previous MS treatment (Yes, No). 
Analysis of secondary endpoints 
Imaging endpoints 
The number of new/newly enlarged T2 lesions and the number of T1 Gd-enhancing lesions were defined 
as key secondary endpoints.  
New/enlarged T2 lesion measurement: 
The number of new/enlarged T2 lesions at each scan is counted with reference to the previous scan. In 
case a new lesion in the week 24 scan that would disappear in the week 48 scan and reappear in the 
week 72 scan (which is uncommon), it would be counted as new T2 at w72. A lesion that would appear 
in the week 24 scan and disappears in the last scan, would not be counted at the last scan. A significant 
enlargement (of at least 3 voxels) due to a new focal lesion (that overlaps an existing lesion) would be 
counted. 
T1 lesion measurement: 
Gd-enhancing T1 lesion count at each scan is assessed independently, with the capability of referring to 
the previous scan if needed. A lesion which would enhance on several scans would be counted on each 
scan if meeting the gad lesion criteria. However, contrast enhancing lesions in MS infrequently enhance 
for more than 4 to 6 weeks. For reference, please note the following Gd lesion criteria: 
1.  A Gd lesion must have 3 or more enhancing voxels that are contiguous and have at least 20% 
of intensity increase in the post-contrast T1C relative to Pre-contrast T1P. 
2.  The enhancing voxels must be totally or partially co-localized with the T2 lesions. 
3.  The enhancing voxels must be iso- / hyperintensity comparing to NAWM (normal appearing white 
matter). 
Upon  request,  the  Applicant  clarified  that  the  precise  definition  of  the  MRI  endpoints  “number  of 
new/newly enlarged T2 lesions” and the “number of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions” were pre-specified in the 
SOP of the central reader NeuroRx. While the exact definition would have been expected to be described 
also in the clinical study report and in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) in order to be unambiguously 
pre-defined, this issue was not further pursued. 
Primary analyses of MRI-based endpoints were only based on data from MRI scans performed during the 
DB period (i.e. prior to switching to OL teriflunomide treatment or prior to early treatment discontinuation 
due  to  other  reasons).  In  case  during  the  DB  treatment  period  an  additional  MRI  due  to  higher  MRI 
activity at week 24 was performed at week 36, these data were also considered for the analyses. 
The number of new or enlarged T2 lesions per MRI scan was analyzed using a negative binomial (NB) 
regression  model  with 
robust  variance  estimation 
for 
the 
individual 
treatment  periods 
(factors/covariates: treatment, region, pubertal status, age; offset: log(number of MRIs)).  
A similar NB regression model was used for the analyses on the number of T1 Gd-enhancing lesions and 
the number of new T1 hypointense lesions per MRI scan for the individual treatment periods.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289596/2021  
Page 25/109 
 
 
 
 
The change from baseline in volume of T2 lesions and of T1 hypointense lesions, and the percentage 
change from baseline in brain volume were analyzed using a mixed-effect model with repeated measures 
(MMRM) approach (treatment, pubertal status, region, visit, visit*treatment, baseline) with appropriate 
transformation, if necessary (cubic root transformation for volume of T2 and T1 hypointense lesions). If 
significant violation from normality existed after transformation, rank analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
with last observation carried forward (LOCF) was used.  
The proportion of patients free of new or enlarged T2 lesions at Weeks 48 and 96 of the DB-period was 
estimated with the Kaplan-Meier (KM) method. 
Analysis of secondary endpoints is based on the missing-at-random (MAR) assumption (or similar aligned 
assumptions depending on the endpoint). Appropriateness of this assumption may be questionable for 
early  and  permanent  treatment  discontinuation  and  in  case  of  switching  due  to  high  MRI  activity. 
Consequently, robustness of results for secondary imaging endpoints regarding deviations from the MAR 
assumption was unclear and further analysis were required. 
In particular, as restriction of evaluation to the DB period targets a hypothetical estimand, analysis using 
all available MRI assessments during the first 96 weeks following randomization regardless of switching 
was requested for secondary imaging endpoints. Furthermore, analysis based only on data from the DB 
period (i.e. prior to switching) was requested to multiply imputing missing MRI assessments during the 
first 96 weeks based on the placebo arm. For key secondary imaging endpoints tipping point analysis 
based on data of the DB period were requested as well.  
In addition to these analyses, the key secondary endpoint “new/enlarged T2 lesions” was requested to 
be analysed accounting for the baseline number of lesions.  
Additional secondary endpoints 
EDSS score and the change from baseline in EDSS score were summarized descriptively at each visit by 
treatment group. 
Cognitive outcome: The SDMT was analyzed by a MMRM model similar as done for volume of lesions and 
brain. The MMRM model included an additional covariate or age. 
Disease-free patients were defined as patients 1) with no confirmed clinical relapse, 2) with no 24-week 
sustained  disability  progression  (≥0.5-point  EDSS  score  increase  if  baseline  EDSS  score  >5.5  or  ≥1-
point EDSS score increase from baseline if baseline EDSS score ≤5.5, persisting for ≥24 weeks) and 3) 
free of MRI activity (No Gd-enhancing T1 lesions and no new/enlarging T2 lesions). The proportion of 
disease-free patients was summarized at Weeks 48 and 96 based on all patients having an MRI at these 
time points. KM methods were used for estimation. 
Multiplicity control  
To  allow  confirmatory  conclusions  for  the  primary  and  the  two  key  secondary  imaging  endpoints, 
multiplicity was planned to be controlled via hierarchical testing using the following sequence: 1) time 
to first relapse, 2) number of new/newly enlarged T2 lesions and 3) number of T1 Gd-enhancing lesion. 
Each hypothesis was to be formally tested, only if the preceding one was significant at 5% level. While 
the  approach  in  principle  properly  controls  the  type  1  error  in  the  strong  sense,  no  confirmatory 
conclusions are possible for any of the endpoints as definition of secondary endpoints is unclear and as 
the study  failed its primary endpoint. Consequently, all results of the study need to be considered to be 
exploratory and descriptive. 
The database has been locked 27 November 2019 and randomization codes for treatment allocation of 
all randomized patients were released the following day.

Recruitment 
This study was conducted in 57 centers in 22 countries. 
•  Study initiation date, DB phase: 16 July 2014 (date of first signed informed consent form) 
•  Study completion date, DB phase: 25 October 2019 (date of last patient last visit) 
Conduct of the study 
There  were  4  global  and  2  local  (Russian)  amendments  made  to  the  original  protocol,  dated  30  May 
2013. Main changes in the global amendments were:  
•  Amendment  1  (18  December  2013)  added  MRI  measures  (weeks  24,  48  and  96)  and  MRI 
outcomes (change in T2 lesion volume, change in T1 hypointense lesion volume and new lesion 
number and brain atrophy) to the protocol.  
•  Amendment  2  (26  June  2014)  extended  the  OL  period  to  up  192  weeks,  added  a  new  MRI 
measurement (72 weeks) and further endpoints including proportion of patients free of new or 
enlarged MRI T2-lesions at Weeks 48 and 96 and proportion of disease-free patients.  
•  Amendment 3 (02 August 2018): Modification of total expected number of patients to include 
approximately 20% pre-pubertal patients or 10% of patients under the age of 13 years at time 
of inclusion into the study and at least 25% male patients.

•  Amendment 4 (11 September 2019): addition of a biomarker research.  
All  randomized  patients  were  treated  with  IMP  and  93.6%  and  93.0%  of  the  randomized  patients 
completed the DB period (e.g., patients who completed early due to first RAP-confirmed clinical relapse 
or high MRI activity or who reached week 96 of the double-blind treatment phase) in the teriflunomide 
and placebo groups, respectively. The main reason for permanent treatment discontinuation was AE in 
the teriflunomide group (5.5%) and lack of efficacy or other reason in the placebo group (3.5%). 
Overall, there were 34 protocol deviation and 6 patients had critical or major efficacy-related protocol 
deviations, mainly IMP interruption exceeding 2 consecutive weeks reported in 3 patients (5.3%) in the 
placebo group.  
Baseline data 
Baseline demographic characteristics  
The mean age of the overall study population was 14.6 years with a range from 10 to 17 years at study 
entry.  Overall,  26  patients  (15.7%)  were  below  13  years  old  at  enrolment.  The  majority  of  patients 
were female (66.9%) but 33.1 % of patients were male paediatrics that is in accordance with the agreed 
PIP modification, February 2017 (EMEA-001094-PIP01-10-M04). 
Most subjects were Caucasian/White (70.5%) and 42.8% of the subjects were Europeans. 
At baseline, 10 patients (6.0%) were pre-pubertal according to Tanner Stage I: 5 (4.6%) of the patients 
in  the  teriflunomide  group  and  5  (8.8%)  patients  in  the  placebo  group.  At  disease  (MS)  onset,  34 
patients  (21.8%)  were  pre-pubertal,  21/99  (21.2  %)  of  the  patients  in  the  teriflunomide  group  and 
13/57 (22.8 %) patients in the placebo group. 
The  mean  BW  was  58.0  kg.  Eleven  patients  (6.6%)  had  a  BW  ≤40  kg.  The  mean  body  mass  index 
(BMI) was 22.1 kg/m².  
Baseline disease characteristics  
Overall  disease  characteristics  at  baseline  were  generally  similar  among  the  treatment  groups.  All 
patients were diagnosed with RRMS. 
The  study  population  consisted  of  relatively  newly  diagnosed  RRMS  patients  with  a  comparable  time 
since MS diagnosis (mean =1.40 years, median =0.69 years) and time since first symptoms of MS (mean 
=2.34 years, median =1.61 years). While in the placebo group, the mean time since the most recent 
relapse onset relative to randomization was 5.79 months, patients in the teriflunomide arm experienced 
their most recent relapse at a mean time of 4.97 months before randomization. The number of overall 
experienced relapses before study entry was comparable between the two treatment arms (mean = 2.8, 
median = 2.0) as were the number of relapses within  the past year (mean = 1.5, median =1.0) and 
within the past 2 years (mean = 2.1, median =2.0). All patients experienced relapses within the past 2 
years. EDSS scores at baseline were comparable with an overall mean EDSS score of 1.3 representing 
almost no disability with only minimal signs in some functional systems. This is considered typical for 
the patient population included with a slower disability progression over time as compared to adult MS 
patients. 
The mean number of Gd-enhancing lesions at baseline was 3.9 for both treatment groups (median =1.0), 
while around half of the patients in both groups had ≥1 T1 Gd-enhancing lesions on MRI. The number 
of new/newly enlarged T2 lesions is determined in reference to the MRI scans of the previous visit. Thus, 
it is not a value that is present at baseline. The mean (SD) number of baseline T2 lesions was slightly 
higher in the placebo group, 60.3 (40.8), than in the teriflunomide group, 51.3 (38.2). The number of

hypointense T1 lesions was not available for the baseline visit as this parameter request was not planned 
with the MRI reading center. 
Approximately 19.9% of patients across both treatment groups had been previously treated with a DMT 
with the most common DMT being interferon beta-1-a (10.1% in the teriflunomide group and 17.5% in 
the placebo group). Around 80% of subjects were naïve to previous treatment with DMT.  
With regard to descriptive purposes of primary symptoms, a total of 27.7% patients were included into 
the study with non-encephalopathic CNS clinical events, 6.6% with ADEM and 4.2% of the patients with 
other types  of  MS  event that were not considered  to contradict the final  diagnosis  of  RRMS  for  these 
patients.  
Numbers analysed 
All 166 randomized patients were included in efficacy (ITT) and safety populations.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint  
Primary analysis: time to first confirmed clinical relapse 
Confirmed clinical relapse occurred in 36.7% in the teriflunomide group and in 43.9% in the placebo 
group in the DB period, corresponding to a relative rate reduction of 34.3% (HR: 0.657; 95% CI: 0.388 
to  1.113,  p=0.2949).  Patients  in  the  placebo  group  experienced  the  first  confirmed  relapse  after 
randomization earlier than patients in the teriflunomide group; the median duration was 39.14 weeks 
versus 75.29 weeks, respectively; the mean and SD were 49.25 (33.36) weeks versus 62.60 [36.12] 
weeks, respectively. The estimated probability of confirmed clinical relapse at Week 96, using the KM 
method was 0.531 in the placebo group and 0.389 in the teriflunomide group (Table 4).

Figure 2: Primary analysis: Kaplan-Meier (KM) plot of time to first confirmed clinical relapse 
after randomization during the DB treatment period (ITT population) 
Note: Confirmed clinical relapse must have objective signs on the examining neurologist's examination confirming the event and must 
then be reviewed and confirmed by an independent relapse adjudication panel (RAP). Time to event is calculated as date of confirmed 
clinical relapse - randomization date + 1 day. 
Looking at the KM plot (Figure 2) of time to first confirmed relapse it directly becomes apparent that the 
proportional  Hazards  assumption  is  not  fulfilled.  Up  to  about  24  weeks  there  is  almost  no  difference 
between  estimated  relapse  rates  (although  up  to  week  12  relapses  were  slightly  more  frequent  for 
teriflunomide) and from week 36/48 onwards, the curves are almost parallel (although numbers at risk 
are low at the end of the curves). Consequently, the power of the study to detect the observed difference 
in KM curves is reduced. The most informative part seems to be restricted to the time between 24 to 
24/36 weeks. Furthermore, for this analysis patients are censored at time of high MRI activity (most at 
week 36) which is questionable given that censoring is highly informative. Sensitivity analysis counting 
high MRI activity as an event as discussed below would partly address this issue (in case the primary 
analysis were successful), though it should be noted that the design hampers an unbiased analysis of 
the primary endpoint.

Teriflunomide reduced the rate of confirmed clinical relapse or high MRI activity, whichever came first, 
when compared to placebo by 43.4% (49.5% of patients in the teriflunomide group versus 68.4% of 
patients in the placebo group; HR: 0.566; 95% CI: 0.368 to 0.870, p=0.0409), representing significant 
differences  for  teriflunomide  in  comparison  to  placebo,  however  only  nominally  since  the  primary

analysis failed to show statistical significance. Patients in the placebo group relapsed earlier than in the 
teriflunomide group (median duration of 37.00 weeks and 72.14 weeks, respectively) (Table 5).

For  the  analysis  of  the  above  described  composite  endpoint  “time  to  relapse  or  high  MRI  activity” 
addressed as part of the pre-specified sensitivity analyses for the primary endpoint, a post-hoc analysis 
using placebo-based multiple imputations (jump to reference) to handle early permanent discontinuation 
of treatment/DB period to assess deviations from the non-informative censoring assumption has been 
provided upon request. Results were consistent with the results of the pre-planned analysis, apparently 
due  to  the  fact  that  only  few  patients  discontinued  without  event  (Table  6).  An  additional  post-hoc 
analysis  considering  interval  censoring  of  the  MRI  component  supported  the  pre-planned  analysis. 
Apparently, interval censoring seems less relevant for the actual data.

Note: Confirmed clinical relapse must have objective signs on the examining neurologist's examination confirming the event and

Time to event is calculated as date of confirmed clinical relapse or high MRI activity (whichever comes first) - randomization date 
+ 1 day for patient who completed the DB period. Follow-up time for patient who discontinued from the DB 
period was imputed based on Kaplan-Meier multiple imputation method. Imputation was performed 200 times.

c Derived from log-rank test with stratification of region and pubertal status. 
Kaplan-Meier multiple imputation approach was used based on placebo data only to implement jump to reference imputation. 
PP analyses for the primary endpoint (including the sensitivity analysis counting also high MRI activity 
as an event) were in line with the primary analyses. With regard to the analysis counting also MRI activity 
as an event the probability of having an event by week 48 was 58.2% and 37.7% in the placebo and 
teriflunomide arm, respectively and therefore comparable to that of the primary pre-specified analysis 
although not statistically significant (p = 0.0558). 
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Key secondary endpoints: 
Number of new or enlarged T2-lesions 
A  (nominal)  significant  reduction  in  the  rate  of  new  or  enlarged  T2  lesions  per  MRI  scan  was 
demonstrated with teriflunomide, compared to placebo (4.7 and 10.5 lesions, respectively, (p=0.0006), 
corresponding to a 55% reduction over the DB treatment period (rate ratio [RR]: 0.450; 95% CI: 0.285 
to 0.711) (Table 7).

Number of Gadolinium-enhancing T1 lesions 
A  (nominal)  significant  reduction  in  the  rate  of  Gd-enhancing  T1  lesions  was  demonstrated  with 
teriflunomide (p<0.0001), compared to placebo (1.9 and 7.5 lesions, respectively), corresponding to a 
75% reduction at the end of the DB treatment period (RR: 0.253; 95% CI: 0.126 to 0.505). While post-
baseline, the mean number of T1 Gd-enhancing lesions in the teriflunomide group declined from 3.9 at 
baseline to 1.4, the mean number of T1 Gd-enhancing lesions in the placebo group increased from 3.9 
at baseline to 5.1 (Table 8).

The North Africa and North America were combined for region stratum due to small sample size 
As the study failed its primary endpoint and multiplicity was planned to be controlled across primary and 
secondary  endpoints  via  hierarchical  testing,  none  of  these  key  secondary  endpoints  can  be  claimed 
“statistically significant”. 
Requested post-hoc analyses for the key secondary endpoints showed that at week 36, 21 scans were 
performed under placebo and 44 scans under teriflunomide. Ignoring these scans similar results were 
obtained as in the pre-planned analyses. 
Additional post hoc analyses were provided upon request for all MRI endpoints that included all available 
MRI assessments performed within 96 weeks after randomization (including those obtained after the DB 
period due to early treatment discontinuation or switch to OL teriflunomide treatment). According to the 
provided analyses 44 additional scans were included for placebo and 35 additional scans were included 
for teriflunomide as compared to the analysis of the DB period. The number of additional scans included,

however, is relatively small as compared to the number of remaining missing scans until week 96. Hence, 
missing data imputation remains critical. 
Considering 21+44 scans at week 36, in total 4 x 57 + 21 = 249 scans would have been expected for 
placebo and 4 x 109 + 44 = 480 for teriflunomide, leading to 249 – 123 = 126 scans for placebo patients 
and 480 – 339 = 141 for teriflunomide patients that were missing in the reported analysis, of which 44 
and  35  scans  were  added  in  the  analysis  of  the  DB  and  OL  phase,  corresponding  to  35%  and  25%. 
Whereas  results  from  the  combined  data  of  DB  and  OL  phase  could  have  been  reassuring  and  even 
conservative  due  to  the  switch  from  placebo  to  the  active  treatment,  the  large  amount  of  remaining 
missing scans does not allow for a confirming conclusion. During the procedure, the Applicant provided 
the number of missing scans. However, the Applicant confirmed that the additional value of the analyses 
including OL data is limited but still supportive due to a positive trend.  
With regard to the requested sensitivity analysis for the number of new/newly enlarged T2 lesions the 
Applicant  took  the  number  of  T2  lesions  into  account  as  the  number  of  new/enlarged  T2  lesions  is 
assessed in reference to the MRI scans of the previous visit. Thus, it is not a value that could be presented 
at baseline. A (nominal) significant reduction in the rate of new or enlarged T2 lesions per MRI scan was 
demonstrated with teriflunomide, compared to placebo (3,6 and 5,4 lesions, respectively) (p = 0.0446), 
corresponding to a 33% reduction over the DB treatment period (rate ratio [RR]: 0.665; 95%CI: 0.447 
to 0.990). The relative risk reduction in this analysis (with adjustment for baseline T2 lesion count) is 
lower compared to the 55% relative reduction in the pre-defined analysis (estimated without adjusting 
for baseline T2 lesion count). This might be due to some baseline imbalances in T2 lesions (mean of 51 
vs  60)  favouring  placebo  in  the  unadjusted  analysis.  Although  both  analyses  showed  a  nominally 
significant  effect,  the  adjusted  analysis  reduced  considerably  the  effect  size  due  to  the  reported 
considerable baseline differences. Due to these baseline differences, the adjusted analysis, even not pre-
specified, is considered to yield a more accurate treatment effect estimate. 
Further requested and provided post hoc analyses showed, that the results do not appear to be robust 
when relevant missing data imputation is applied in a setting with large proportion of missing data in the 
DB  period.  70%  of  placebo  patients  and  47%  of  teriflunomide  patients  had  MRI  data  to  be  imputed. 
Referring to the number of missing scans, this lack of robustness cannot be rebutted by an analysis on 
all MRI scans, including those taken in the  OL period, since the number of additional scans in the  OL 
period remains small compared to the number of remaining missing scans. Whereas the large amount 
of missing data itself raises concerns about the robustness of the data, the analyses with imputed data 
drastically reduce the treatment effect and, consequently, no significant treatment effect is given. Taking 
into account, that this reduction in effect is mainly due to the imputation in the active treatment group 
and considering the fact that missing data in most cases occurred after patients had switched to the OLE 
phase  because  of  having  experienced  a  relapse  or  a  high  MRI  activity,  obviously  correlated  with  an 
unfavourable  outcome  in  the  key  secondary  endpoints,  the  requested  reference-based  imputation 
method appears justified as a conservative sensitivity analysis. Due to the large amount of missing data, 
it  appears informative to use a missing data imputation  method that is capable to model a vanishing 
effect difference in patients with missing MRI data, even if this can be considered as rather conservative. 
Applying  this  approach  the  effect  is  approximately  halved  and  the  nominal  statistical  significance 
disappears.

treatment arm were relapse free compared to 45.5% under placebo. 
Other MRI related endpoints 
Analyses of these other MRI related endpoints are only exploratory and no confirmatory conclusions can

Volume of T2 lesions: At Week 96, the mean change from baseline in volume of T2 lesions were 0.073 
mL in the teriflunomide group and 0.201 mL in the placebo group with a least square (LS) mean (standard 
error [SE]) difference from placebo of -0.128 (0.049) mL (p=0.0100). The mean patient level volume 
(SD) of T2-lesions per scan was significantly lower in the teriflunomide group (13.8 [23.0] mL) when 
compared to the placebo group (15.7 [18.1] mL) (p=0.0223). 
Volume of T1 hypointense lesions: No statistical difference was observed between the teriflunomide and 
the placebo treatment arm on the volume of T1 hypointense lesions per scan. The mean patient level 
total volume (SD) of T1 hypointense lesions per scan was similar in both groups: 2.8 [7.4] mL and 2.9 
[6.4] mL in the teriflunomide and the placebo groups, respectively. 
New  hypointense  T1  lesions:  Teriflunomide  significantly  reduced  the  number  of  new  hypointense  T1 
lesions per MRI scan by 49% compared to placebo (RR: 0.507; 95% CI: 0.281 to 0.913, p=0.0236). 
The observed mean of new T1 lesions per scan was lower in the teriflunomide group (3.7) than in the 
placebo group (8.1). The adjusted number of such T1 lesions was 1.2 in the teriflunomide group and 2.4 
in the placebo group. 
Proportion  of  patients  free  of  new  or  enlarged  T2  lesions:  At  Week  96,  10.1%  of  patients  in  the 
teriflunomide group and 3.5% of patients in the placebo group were free of new or enlarged T2-lesions. 
Brain volume: A decrease in the brain volume has been observed in both treatment groups. No statistical 
difference  was  observed  between  the  teriflunomide  and  placebo  groups  on  the  percentage  change  in 
brain volume. The mean percent changes in brain volume from baseline to Week 96 (MMRM data) were 
-0.529 in the teriflunomide group and -0.570 in the placebo group. 
Change from baseline in EDSS: No relevant changes in EDSS scores were seen from study start until the 
end of the 96 weeks period. Results for the EDSS score were only descriptively summarized: the mean 
(SD) EDSS score at baseline was 1.4 (0.9) and 1.2 (0.9) for the placebo and the teriflunomide treatment 
group,  respectively,  while  at  week  96  the  mean  (SD)  EDSS  score  was  1.7  (1.2)  and  1.2  (0.9) 
respectively, representing a slight deterioration under placebo of 0.3. Requested post hoc analyses on 
6-month confirmed disability progression (CDP-6M), both for the DB treatment period and for the first 
96 weeks regardless of patients discontinuing the DB-period and switching to OL teriflunomide, showed 
that  only  few  patients  experienced  a  CDP-6M  in  the  DB  period  with  2  (3.5%)  patients  in  the  placebo 
group and 5 (4.6%) patients under teriflunomide treatment. However, due to the switch to OL rescue 
treatment which was disproportionately higher in the placebo group compared to the teriflunomide group 
these results are difficult to interpret. During the 96-week period, better results were provided for CDP-
6M in the active treatment arm with 8 (14.0%) patients in the placebo group and 9 (8.3%) patients in 
the teriflunomide group who experienced a CDP-6M.  
Cognitive outcome 
SDMT:  No  statistical  difference  was  observed  between  the  teriflunomide  and  placebo  groups  on  the 
change in number of completed items and correct substitutions measured by SDMT. 
Cognitive Battery Tests: No meaningful differences between groups were observed for cognitive tests. 
These  tests  included  BVMT-R,  trail  making  test  A  and  B,  Beery  VMI  raw  score,  Wechsler  abbreviated 
scale of intelligence II Vocabulary total raw score, D-KEFS letter fluency, category fluency and category 
switching total correct responses raw score, and selective reminding test. 
Proportion  of  disease-free  patients  (exploratory  endpoint):  At  Week  96,  6.4%  of  the  patients  in  the 
teriflunomide group and 1.8% of the patients in the placebo group were disease free according to the 
defined criteria as stated in the statistical section. However, week 96 results are based on a very small 
number of patients that limit the overall conclusions.

Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses of the primary endpoint (pre-specified): 
Figure 3: Subgroup analysis: Summary of time to first confirmed clinical relapse after 
randomization during DB treatment period by all subgroups (forest plot) (ITT population) 
Note: Confirmed clinical relapse must have objective signs on the examining neurologist's examination confirming the event and must 
then be reviewed and confirmed by an independent relapse adjudication panel (RAP).  
Time to event is calculated as date of confirmed clinical relapse - randomization date + 1 day.  
Hazard ratio for each subgroup is derived using Cox proportional-hazards model with treatment group, region and pubertal status as 
covariates and with robust variance estimation.  
The North Africa and North America were combined for region stratum, the Black and Other were combined for race subgroup, the 0 
and 1 were combine for number of relapse experienced within past 1 year due to small sample size.  
For the region 2 subgroup analysis, the small region North America is combined with Europe, North Africa is combined with Middle 
East and Asia is analysed separately. Region 2 is not used as a stratum in the Cox proportional-hazards model for other subgroup 
analyses.

Results of the subgroup analyses were in favour  of  teriflunomide and  overall consistent except for the 
subgroup of Black/Others patients, for the subgroup of patients from North America/North Africa region 
(these  2  different  regions  were  pooled  due  to  small  numbers  of  patients  and  numbers  of  relapses 
experienced overall), and for the subgroup of patients who experienced 1 or 3 relapses overall. In the 
subgroup of patients with 2 relapses experienced overall before randomization teriflunomide significantly 
reduced the risk of a confirmed clinical relapse by 75.0% (HR: 0.250; 95% CI: 0.086 to 0.723). In the 
subgroup of patients with highly active disease at baseline teriflunomide significantly reduced the risk of 
a confirmed clinical relapse by 68.1% (HR: 0.319; 95% CI: 0.128 to 0.793). 
Analyses with regard to dosing recommendations: 
For the teriflunomide group, there was a process of dose adjustment in the paediatric population, based 
on BW, and with individual dose adjustment based on predicted exposure during the 8-week PK run-in 
phase,  in  which  patients  received  half  their  target  dose.  The  underlying  assumption  was  that  the 
appropriate exposure in children would be similar to that obtained in adults with the 14 mg once daily 
dose, which was shown to have the best benefit/risk. (Reference is made to the PK section). 
Clinical relapses may have occurred before the therapeutic effect was developed, as indicated by the 
larger effect size and lower p value in the sensitivity analyses, excluding the clinical relapses observed 
during  the  PK  run-in  phase,  compared  to  the  primary  analysis,  which  included  all  relapses  since 
randomization: HR (95% CI): 0.657 (0.388 to 1.113); p=0.2949 for the primary analysis, and HR (95% 
CI): 0.507 (0.282 to 0.911), p=0.0815 for sensitivity analysis excluding the relapses. According to the 
Applicant, it is therefore probable that the 8-week half-dose phase had a negative impact on the study 
results, and it is therefore intended to start immediately teriflunomide treatment at the full dose. 
From a statistical point of view, censoring patients at time of relapse in the PK run-in is questionable and 
therefore,  this  analysis  should  be  considered  with  caution.  However,  no  additional  analysis  can  be 
recommended to robustly derive the efficacy for an application of teriflunomide without titration from 
the current study. From a clinical perspective, the analysis provides little information with regard to the 
benefit/ risk for use of teriflunomide without titration. However, overall the efficacy is not expected to 
be essentially impacted by starting with the adult equivalent dose. 
Consistency of the efficacy of teriflunomide in the paediatric and adult RMS populations: 
Key  results  of  Study  EFC11759/TERIKIDS  are  presented  side  by  side  with  those  of  Study 
EFC6049/TEMSO and EFC6260/TOPIC, which were the 2 studies with both clinical and MRI evaluations 
over a similar duration. Only the information on the 14 mg daily dose is provided for the adult studies, 
as this is the basis for the 14 mg daily recommended dose for paediatric patients with RRMS based on 
BW, with which Study EFC11759/TERIKIDS was designed.

Abbreviations: CI, confidence interval; CIS, clinically isolated syndrome; Gd, gadolinium; HR, hazard ratio; MRI, magnetic resonance

a TERIKIDS study: clinical relapses confirmed by adjudication panel, high MRI activity threshold for the composite endpoint; volume 
of MRI lesions includes T2 lesions.  
b TEMSO and TOPIC studies: volume of lesions include T1-enhancing lesions and T2 lesions, without double-counting (combined unique 
lesions).  
c TOPIC study: relapses confirming clinical diagnosis of MS. 
From Table 11, it is not possible to meaningfully compare effect sizes, i.e. for time to relapse, or number 
of Gd-enhancing lesions between the paediatric study and studies performed in adult patients as there 
were  numerous  specificities  in  the  design  of  each  study.  However,  since  efficacy  of  teriflunomide  has 
already been demonstrated in adult patients with RRMS, the Applicant was invited to consider and justify 
extrapolation of efficacy from the adult to the paediatric population with RRMS.  
During  the  procedure,  the  Applicant  provided  data  for  the  extrapolation  of  efficacy  from  the  adult 
teriflunomide patient population to the paediatric patient population based on MRI endpoints taking the 
EMEA reflection paper on the use of extrapolation in the development of medicines for paediatric into 
account. The possibility to extrapolate efficacy from adults to children was justified based on arguments 
that genetic, serum, CSF and cell-based studies largely support  a shared biology  between paediatric-
onset  and  adult-onset  disease.  However,  the  Applicant  also  mentioned  “The  PK  results  of 
EFC11759/TERIKIDS show overall consistency of PK profiles in children and adults which supports the 
efficacy extrapolation from adult patients to the paediatric population to determine the overall paediatric 
treatment effect.” In our understanding, consistency of PK profiles between children and adults is not 
considered a justification for efficacy extrapolation nor needed as a prerequisite. Justification needs to 
be given for the assumption that similar exposure will lead to similar PD and efficacy outcome in children 
compared to adults. Subsequently, an optimal dose for the target paediatric population can be defined 
(with the help of a qualified PK model and observed paediatric PK data) to achieve same exposure in 
children compared to adults. 
From the clinical studies performed in adult patients, Study TEMSO and TOPIC were considered relevant 
for  the  efficacy  extrapolation  due  to  the  similar  2-year  study  duration  compared  to  TERIKIDS  and  a 
similar frequency and MRI visit schedules in TERIKIDS. 
The primary extrapolation was based on the adult RMS TEMSO data only since TOPIC was conducted in 
a CIS population,  i.e. TEMSO  data were used  to  derive  an  informative prior to analyze  the  TERIKIDS 
data with a Bayesian approach. Supportive analyses using data from both TEMSO and TOPIC to assess

the  robustness  of  the  extrapolation  results  were  also  provided.  The  patients  enrolled  in  Study  TOPIC 
included patients who could retrospectively be diagnosed as MS as per McDonald 2010 criteria applied 
retrospectively at study entry based on MRI information. However, as the classification was not possible 
in all patients based on the information available (295/618 not classified) and the numbers were small 
(78  met  the  diagnosis  criteria  [only  25  in  the  teriflunomide  14mg  group],  245  did  not  meet  the 
diagnosis), this classification has not been used for additional sensitivity analyses. 
The  efficacy  extrapolation  from  the  adult  to  the  paediatric  population  was  conducted  for  two  MRI 
endpoints: 1) number of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions and 2) number of new or enlarging T2 lesions. Both 
endpoints are well established for assessing the inflammatory component of MS and have been widely 
used  in  MS  clinical  trials.  Furthermore,  both  were  prospectively  defined  as  key  secondary  efficacy 
endpoints in TERIKIDS and were important secondary endpoints in the teriflunomide adult development 
program. 
MRIs were performed approximately every 6 months in the 3 studies, based on a standardized acquisition 
in certified centers followed by central reading of the images. Methods between the adult and paediatric 
studies were essentially similar, with a few differences. In the 3 studies, the number of Gd-enhancing 
lesions was assessed independently on each scan, and the number of new and enlarged T2 lesions was 
assessed with respect to the previous scan. A difference between the adult studies and TERIKIDS was 
that the T2 lesions were measured separately of the Gd-enhancing lesions in TERIKIDS, whereas the key 
variable in the 2 adult studies was the unique active lesions, which was computed as the addition of T2 
lesions with no Gd-enhancement and lesions with Gd-enhancement. As Gd-enhancing lesions generally 
appear  as  T2  lesions,  the  T2  variable  in  TERIKIDS  and  unique  active  lesion  in  the  adult  studies  are 
similar, and in consequence the number of unique active lesions of Studies TEMSO and TOPIC was used 
as a proxy for the number of new or enlarging T2 lesions which is considered acceptable. 
With  regard  to  the  statistical  methods  that  were  used,  an  informative  prior  derived  from  adult  study 
TEMSO (and additionally from studies TEMSO and Topic) was used to analyse the TERIKIDS data with a 
Bayesian approach.

Whereas approach 1 uses the age distribution from TERIKIDS to derive a prior from the adult studies 
relevant for this age distribution, approach 2 did not take age into account. Using different weighing of 
the  adult  data  corresponding  to  different  effective  sample  sizes,  results  were  obtained  similar  to  the 
results from TERIKIDS study. Whereas approach 1 relies on the specific functional relation of the efficacy 
parameter to age, approach 2 prior relies on the assumption that efficacy is unrelated to age. Obviously, 
both assumptions are difficult to verify using adult data only, but similarity between the results of both 
approaches appears reassuring. 
In conclusion, the Applicant has demonstrated that integration of the adult MRI data into the paediatric 
data in a Bayesian way does not change the results considerably.

Supportive study EFC11759 – ongoing open-label extension 
Methods 
The  OL  extension  period  of  Study  EFC11759  is  an  ongoing  long-term  phase  of  study  EFC11759  to 
evaluate the long-term effect with focus on long-term safety of teriflunomide. 
The  first  patient  has  been  enrolled:  02  April  2015;  an  interim  analysis  regarding  efficacy  has  been 
provided with cut-off date: 27 November 2019. 
All patients who were previously treated with placebo or teriflunomide received teriflunomide. All patients 
started with a 8 weeks  PK  run-in  phase.  Those who were in  the teriflunomide arm remained on  their 
adjusted 14 mg adult equivalent dose and those who were in the placebo arm underwent the PK run-in 
with “7 mg adult equivalent to adjust the dose”. The blinded PK run-in phase was intended to provide 
individual  PK  parameters  to  allow  individual  dose  adjustment  to  ensure  that  patients  would  reach 
exposure  similar  to  that  seen  in  adults  treated  with  14  mg  adult-equivalent  dose  (the  “14  mg  adult-
equivalent dose”) for the remainder of the study. 
The  duration  of  the  OL  period  was  96  weeks  for  patients  who  completed  the  96  week  BD  period  on 
treatment, and longer for patients who switched to the  OL period early during the initial 96 week DB 
period due to a confirmed relapse or in case of high MRI activity (for a total follow-up of 192 weeks). 
Patient enrolled in the OL period were patients included in the DB period of the study who had the option 
to continue in the OL period because patients experienced a relapse after the DB period PK run-in phase 
(8 weeks) confirmed by the RAP; or patients had high MRI activity, meeting protocol criteria, during the 
DB period; or patients completed the 96-week DB period. 
152 patients were enrolled in the OL period: 100 patients in the teriflunomide/teriflunomide group and 
52 patients in the placebo/teriflunomide group. As of the data cut-off date, 30 patients had completed 
the  OL  period  (21  patients  in  the  teriflunomide/teriflunomide  group  and  9  patients  in  the 
placebo/teriflunomide  group)  and  88  patients  were  still  ongoing  (61  patients  and  27  patients, 
respectively). 
Results 
From randomization in the DB period to the end of the OL period, confirmed clinical relapse occurred in 
44.0% of patients in the teriflunomide/teriflunomide and 61.5% of patients in the placebo/teriflunomide 
group.  Patients  in  the  placebo/teriflunomide  group  experienced  the  first  confirmed  relapse  after 
randomization earlier (mean [SD]: 82.44 [63.57] weeks) than in the teriflunomide/teriflunomide group 
(mean [SD]: 95.96 [62.96] weeks). 
Patients  who  received  teriflunomide  since  the  start  of  the  DB  period  had  a  numerically  lower  risk  of 
confirmed  clinical  relapse  over  the  combined  BD  and  OL  periods  than  the  patients  who  received 
teriflunomide only from the start of the OL period (HR: 0.61; 95% CI: 0.38 to 0.98; p=0.098).

There was a higher proportion of clinical relapse-free patients in the teriflunomide/teriflunomide group 
(56%) compared to the placebo/teriflunomide (38.5%) group at week 192. 
During the combined DB and OL periods, the percentage of patients with at least 1 new or enlarged T2-
lesion was 84.8% in the teriflunomide/teriflunomide versus 88.5% in the placebo/teriflunomide group. 
The adjusted number of new or enlarged T2 lesions per MRI scan was 6.289 (95% CI: 3.656 to 10.819) 
in the teriflunomide/teriflunomide and 13.038 (95% CI: 7.638 to 22.255) in the placebo/ teriflunomide 
group. 
During the combined DB and OL periods, the percentage of patients with at least 1 Gd-enhancing lesion 
increased more from baseline to post-baseline in the placebo/teriflunomide group (53.8% versus 75%) 
than  in  the  teriflunomide/teriflunomide  group  (52%  versus  57.6%).  The  adjusted  number  of  Gd-
enhancing lesion per MRI scan was 1.933 (95% CI: 0.701, 5.334) in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide 
group and 4.195 (95% CI: 1.775 to 9.916) in the placebo/teriflunomide group, corresponding to a RR 
reduction of 53.9% (RR: 0.461; 95% CI: 0.254 to 0.835, p=0.0106). 
Of  the  152  patients,  21  patients  (21.0%)  in  the  teriflunomide/teriflunomide  group  and  13  patients 
(25.0%) in the placebo/teriflunomide group experienced at least 1 confirmed clinical relapse during the 
OL period. The adjusted annualized relapse rate (ARR) in the OL period was low and similar across the 
treatment groups (0.158 in the teriflunomide/teriflunomide group and 0.141 in the placebo/teriflunomide 
group). 
During the combined DB and OL periods, disability progression sustained for 24 weeks occurred in 13.0% 
of patients in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group and 21.2% in the placebo/ teriflunomide group. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In support of efficacy of teriflunomide in paediatric patients from 10 years to 17 years of age with RRMS 
the  Applicant  submitted  one  pivotal  study,  study  EFC11759  (TERIKIDS),  in  line  with  the  agreed  PIP 
(EMEA- 001094-PIP01-10-M04). 
Study EFC11759 was a two-year, multicentre (57 centers in 22 countries), randomized,  DB, placebo-
controlled, parallel group trial in paediatric patients (10 to <18 years old) with a confirmed diagnosis of 
RRMS and at least one relapse in the 12 months or at least two relapses in the 24 months preceding 
screening.  The  study  also  comprised  an  OL  extension  period  for  the  remainder  of  192  weeks  after 
randomization in order to assess the long-term effect of teriflunomide with focus on long-term safety in 
this specific population. 
The implementation of the placebo arm was combined with switch criteria, i.e. patients who experienced 
a  confirmed  relapse  after  the  PK  run-in  phase  (8  weeks)  had  the  option  to  switch  to  the  OL  period. 
Similarly, patients with high MRI activity according to strict definitions qualified for early switch to the 
OL teriflunomide treatment arm. The criteria were defined as follows: In case of at least 5 new/enlarged 
T2 lesions at the MRI of Week 24 an additional MRI was performed at Week 36. In case the follow-up 
MRI revealed at least 9 new/enlarged T2 lesions at Week 36, or at least 5 new/enlarged T2 lesions on 
each of the 2 consecutive MRI scans at Week 36 and Week 48, or, at Week 48 and Week 72 then the 
patient was qualified for early switch. However, the option of switching to  OL teriflunomide in case of 
high MRI activity prior to a relapse complicated the evaluation of the primary endpoint “time-to-first-
clinical-relapse” as discussed below.  
The population enrolled in this study (n=166; in a 1:2 ratio for placebo and teriflunomide, stratified by 
country and patient pubertal status) was composed of males (33.1%) and females (66.9%) aged from 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289596/2021  
Page 51/109 
 
 
 
 
10 to 17 years with a median age of 15.0 years. The percentage of children <13 years was small (15.7%) 
and was also limited for those who were pre-pubertal (Tanner staging score of I) at baseline [placebo 5 
(8.8%) vs. teriflunomide 5 (4.6%)] and pre-pubertal with regard to disease onset [placebo 13 (22.8%) 
vs. teriflunomide 21 (21.2%)]. The mean number of relapses within the past year was 1.5 (median =1.0) 
and within the past 2 years 2.1 (median =2.0). All patients experienced relapses within the past 2 years. 
Regarding the disease progression stage, the study population consisted of relatively newly diagnosed 
RRMS patients with a mean time since MS diagnosis of about 1.40 years (median =0.69 years) and a 
mean  time  since  first  symptoms  of  MS  of  about  2.34  years  (median  =1.61  years).  The  overall  mean 
EDSS  score  at  baseline  was  1.3  representing  almost  no  disability  with  only  minimal  signs  in  some 
functional systems. Around 80% of patients were naïve to previous MS DT while the most common DMT 
was  interferon  beta  1-a.  Thus,  the  included  patient  population  mainly  consisted  of  early  stage  and 
treatment naïve RRMS patients.  
No dedicated dose response study in the paediatric population was conducted. Study EFC11759 included 
at  the  beginning  a  blinded  PK  run-in  for  the  first  8  weeks  after  randomization,  during  which  patients 
received placebo, or half of their target dose, e.g. 3.5 mg teriflunomide daily for patients ≤40 kg, or 7 
mg  teriflunomide  daily  for  patients  >40  kg.  It  was  anticipated  that  this  would  result  in  an  exposure 
similar to adults being treated with 7 mg teriflunomide daily (the “7 mg adult equivalent dose”). After 
the end of the PK run-in phase, a 14 mg adult equivalent once daily dose (14 mg has been approved for 
the adult RRMS patient population) of teriflunomide based on BW or matching placebo was administered 
per  day.  According  to  a  population  PK  analysis,  the  Applicant  considered,  that  a  dosage  of  14  mg 
teriflunomide once daily would be appropriate for paediatric patients with a BW >40 kg, and a dose of 7 
mg teriflunomide once daily or 14 mg teriflunomide every-other-day for paediatric patients with a BW 
≤40 kg. No patient was adjusted to the 3.5 mg once daily dose during the PK run-in phase.  
The primary endpoint was the “time to first clinical relapse after randomization up to the end of the DB 
treatment  period”.  The  primary  endpoint  is  considered  appropriate  and  is  in  accordance  with  the 
Guideline  on  clinical  investigation  of  medicinal  products  for  the  treatment  of  Multiple  Sclerosis 
(EMA/CHMP/771815/2011, Rev. 2). The study duration of the DB phase was variable, i.e. event-driven. 
Consequently, it is not possible to evaluate the ARR, but the primary endpoint can be considered as a 
surrogate for the analysis of the relapse rate, which could be adequate assuming a constant individual 
relapse  intensity  over  time.  While  this  assumption  may  only  be  valid  in  case  of  adherence  to  study 
treatment, the analysis of time-to-first relapse can be considered as yielding the best available evidence 
on relapse, as patients were offered to switch to the active treatment following a relapse or high MRI 
activity. However, as defined for this study and in combination with the defined switch criteria, evaluation 
and  interpretation  of  ‘time  to  first  clinical  relapse’  is  hampered  as  the  switch  criteria  bear  the  risk  of 
‘losing’ a high number of patients prior to experiencing a relapse. This is problematic as switching prior 
to relapse due to high MRI activity is informative.  
The primary analysis was a stratified log-rank test (stratification: region, pubertal status) using a two-
sided  alpha  level  of  5%.  The  first  confirmed  clinical  relapse  occurring  from  randomization  (including 
relapses  during  the  PK  run-in  phase)  to  the  end  of  the  DB  study  period  was  included  for  analysis. 
Treatment  effect  as  measured  by  the  HR  and  its  associated  95%  CI  were  estimated  using  a  Cox's 
proportional-hazards model (factors: treatment, region, pubertal status, age, number of relapses in the 
year prior  to randomization).  Patients were  censored (1) at  the time of  permanent discontinuation  of 
treatment/DB period, (2) at the time of discontinuing the DB period and switching to OL teriflunomide 
due to high MRI activity and (3) at week 96 (end of DB period) in case patients neither experienced a 
relapse nor high MRI activity. While the non-informative censoring assumption underlying the analysis 
may be valid for (3), validity of this assumption is questionable in the other two cases, and additional 
analyses  were  requested.  Furthermore,  as  the  proportional-hazard  assumption  is  not  fulfilled  in  this 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289596/2021  
Page 52/109 
 
 
 
 
study, the HR is  not a  reliable effect measure:  focus should be on estimates of  relapse probability at 
different time points. 
Four  sensitivity  analyses  were  pre-defined  in  the  SAP  to  show  robustness  of  the  primary  analysis, 
amongst others “time to first confirmed clinical relapse or high MRI activity meeting protocol criteria for 
switching  into  the  OL  period,  whichever  came  first,  after  randomization  before  the  treatment 
discontinuation/completion in the DB period” and “time to first confirmed clinical relapse occurring after 
the PK run-in (8 weeks) phase but before the treatment discontinuation/completion in the DB period” as 
well as 2 post-hoc sensitivity analyses. However, the conducted sensitivity analyses do not address the 
issue of censoring patients at time of permanent and premature discontinuation of treatment/DB period, 
which may be informative, too. A sensitivity analysis using more reasonable assumptions to handle these 
discontinuations  was  therefore  requested  for  the  composite  ‘time  to  high  MRI  activity  or  relapse’. 
Additionally,  interval  censoring  of  the  MRI  component  has  been  requested  to  be  considered  in  an 
additional sensitivity analysis of the composite. 
The  key  secondary  endpoints,  i.e.  the  number  of  new/newly  enlarged  T2  lesions  and  number  of  Gd-
enhancing T1 lesions are also endorsed since they have been related to relapses, the most important 
clinical component of paediatric MS, and are often among the criteria chosen to reflect disease activity. 
It was planned to control the type 1 error for these two endpoints via hierarchical testing. However, in 
the end, results for these endpoints need to be considered descriptive and exploratory only (see efficacy 
data). Other secondary endpoints included MRI related endpoints, cognition (SDMT and Cognitive Battery 
Tests), EDSS score or proportion of clinical relapse-free patients. 
Analysis  of  secondary  endpoints  is  based  on  the  MAR  assumption  (or  similar  aligned  assumptions 
depending  on  the  endpoint).  Appropriateness  of  this  assumption  may  be  questionable  for  early  and 
permanent treatment discontinuation and in case of switching due to high MRI activity. Consequently 
robustness of results for secondary imaging endpoints regarding deviations from the MAR assumption 
was unclear and further analysis were required. In particular, as restriction of evaluation to the DB period 
targets a hypothetical estimand, analysis using all available MRI assessments during the first 96 weeks 
following  randomization  regardless  of  switching  was  requested  for  secondary  imaging  endpoints. 
Furthermore, analysis based only on data from the DB period (i.e. prior to switching) was requested to 
multiply imputing missing MRI assessments during the first 96 weeks based on the placebo arm. For key 
secondary imaging endpoints tipping point analysis based on data of the DB period were requested as 
well. In addition to these analyses, the key secondary endpoint “new/enlarged T2 lesions” was requested 
to be analysed accounting for the baseline number of lesions.  
Overall, the number of protocol violations (n = 34) in the study was considered acceptable and does not 
seem to essentially impact the validity of the collected data. With regard to the analysis populations, the 
ITT population was the primary analysis population for efficacy analysis.  
Pre-specified subgroup analyses were  defined for the primary endpoint based on:  age group at study 
consent  (<13,  ≥13  years),  gender,  race,  pubertal  status  (at  study  consent  and  at  disease  onset), 
baseline BW group (≤40, >40 kg), MS subtypes (RRMS, other forms), number of relapses experienced 
within past 1 year (0, 1, 2 and  ≥3), number of relapses experienced overall (0, 1, 2, 3 and  ≥4), high 
disease activity at baseline (defined as 2 or more relapses in past year, and 1 or more Gd-enhancing 
lesions on baseline MRI (Yes, No)), Region (Europe, North America, Asia, Middle East, North Africa) and 
previous MS treatment (Yes, No). 
While  the  study  was  ongoing,  the  Applicant  requested  a  modification  of  the  agreed  PIP  in  November 
2018 parallel to interactions with the FDA to propose to change the primary endpoint “time to clinical 
relapse”.  At  that  time  the  study  was  fully  enrolled  but  was  still  ongoing  and  it  was  noted  that  more 
patients (21 patients) than anticipated were switching to the OL period, many of them (14 patients) due 
to  high  MRI  activity.  Given  the  anticipated  impact  of  these  switchers  on  the  primary  analysis,  the

Applicant discussed to include high MRI activity switches, along with the confirmed clinical relapses, in a 
composite  primary  endpoint,  which  corresponded  to  one  of  the  pre-planned  sensitivity  analyses  (see 
above). However, PDCO and the FDA did not agree to change the primary endpoint during the ongoing 
study and advised to take the pre-planned sensitivity analysis into account when assessing the efficacy 
data of the study. During the procedure the request for modification was withdrawn.  
During  the  procedure,  the  Applicant  provided  data  for  the  extrapolation  of  efficacy  from  the  adult 
teriflunomide patient population to the paediatric patient population based on MRI endpoints. Actually, 
adult data were used to derive an informative prior to be used in a Bayesian analysis of the TERIKIDS 
data. From the clinical studies performed in adult patients, Study TEMSO and TOPIC were considered 
relevant for the efficacy extrapolation due to the similar 2-year study duration compared to TERIKIDS 
and a similar frequency and MRI visit schedules in TERIKIDS. The primary extrapolation was based on 
the  adult  RMS  TEMSO  data  only  since  TOPIC  was  conducted  in  a  Clinical  Isolated  Syndrome  (CIS) 
population. Supportive analyses using data from both TEMSO and TOPIC to assess the robustness of the 
extrapolation  results  were  also  provided.  The  patients  enrolled  in  Study  TOPIC  included  patients  who 
could retrospectively be diagnosed as MS as per McDonald 2010 criteria applied retrospectively at study 
entry based on MRI information. However, as the classification was not possible in all patients based on 
the information available (295/618 not classified) and the numbers were small (78 met the diagnosis 
criteria [only 25 in the teriflunomide 14mg group], 245 did not meet the diagnosis), this classification 
has not been used for additional sensitivity analyses. The efficacy extrapolation from the adult to the 
paediatric population was conducted for two MRI endpoints: 1) number Gd-enhancing T1 lesions and 2) 
number of new or enlarging T2 lesions.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 109 and 57 patients received teriflunomide and placebo, respectively, and were analysed in 
the ITT. 
Completion rate was high in this DB study. 102 (93.6%) and 53 (93.0%) of the randomized patients in 
the teriflunomide and the placebo arm, respectively, completed the DB treatment period (e.g., patients 
who early completed due to first RAP-confirmed clinical relapse or high MRI activity or who reached week 
96 of the DB treatment phase). Most patients, 100 (91.7%) patients in the teriflunomide treatment arm 
and 52 (91.2%) in the placebo arm entered the OL period. The proportion of patients who completed 
the DB period up to 96 weeks was considerably higher in the teriflunomide treatment group as compared 
to placebo [ 56 (51.4%) vs. 16 (28.1%), respectively]. In the placebo treatment arm a higher proportion 
of patients met the pre-requisites for an early switch to the OL period due to criteria for high MRI activity 
or  confirmed  clinical  relapse  (26.3%  and  38.6%,  respectively)  compared  to  patients  treated  with 
teriflunomide  (12.8% and 29.4%, respectively). This might be  indicative of  an effect of  teriflunomide 
with regard to those endpoints reflecting disease activity. 
Permanent  treatment  discontinuation  due  to  “lack  of  efficacy”  and  “other  reasons”  was  higher  in  the 
placebo  group  when  compared  to  teriflunomide  treatment  [2  (3.5%)  versus  1  (0.9%),  and  2  (3.5%) 
versus  0%,  respectively]  while  “AEs”  as  reason  for  discontinuation  were  higher  in  the  teriflunomide 
treatment arm when compared to placebo (5.5% and 0%, respectively).  
Demographic and disease characteristics overall were adequately balanced across the two groups (with 
the exception of the mean (SD) number of baseline T2 lesions that was slightly higher in the placebo 
group, 60.3 (40.8), than in the teriflunomide group, 51.3 (38.2)) and representative for the paediatric 
RRMS patient population.  
Treatment with teriflunomide in comparison to placebo did not meet the primary objective. The “time to 
first  relapse”  was  slightly  prolonged  for  teriflunomide  compared  to  placebo:  relapse  probability  was 
higher  for  placebo  from  approximately  week  12  onwards  compared  to  teriflunomide  with  29.8%  of 
Assessment report

patients  that  relapsed  by  week  48  in  the  teriflunomide  arm  compared  to  39.1%  in  the  placebo  arm. 
Although  in  comparison  to  placebo  the  time  to  first  confirmed  clinical  relapse  was  delayed  in  the 
teriflunomide treatment arm, representing an effect of teriflunomide on relapses in the paediatric RRMS 
population,  the  difference  did  not  reach  statistical  significance  (p=0.2949).  Looking  at  the  KM  plot  of 
time to first confirmed relapse it directly becomes apparent that the proportional Hazards assumption is 
not  fulfilled.  Up  to  about  24  weeks  there  is  almost  no  difference  between  estimated  relapse  rates 
(although  relapses were slightly  more  frequent for  teriflunomide)  and from  week  36/48  onwards,  the 
curves  are  almost  parallel  (although  numbers  at  risk  are  low  at  the  end  of  the  curves).  The  most 
informative part seems to be restricted to the time between 24 to 24/36 weeks. Consequently, the power 
of the study to detect the observed difference in KM curves is reduced. Furthermore, for this analysis, 
patients are censored at time of high MRI activity (most at week 36) which is questionable given that 
censoring is highly informative. Sensitivity analysis counting high MRI activity as an event as discussed 
below would partly address this issue (in case the primary analysis were successful), though it should 
be noted that the design hampers an unbiased analysis of the primary endpoint. 
With regard to the sensitivity analysis “time to first confirmed clinical relapse or high MRI activity meeting 
criteria for switching into OL period, whichever came first”, teriflunomide prolonged the time to confirmed 
clinical relapse or high MRI activity, whichever came first, when compared to placebo (p=0.0409). While 
also for this analysis the probability of an event (confirmed relapse or high MRI activity, whichever came 
first)  was  consistently  higher  for  placebo  compared  to  teriflunomide  from  approximately  week  12 
onwards, the estimated probability of these events increased after week 24 as compared to the primary 
analysis. This is not unexpected taking into account, that high MRI activity is counted as an event for 
this sensitivity analysis. The probability of having an event by week 48 was 55.8% and 37.9% in the 
placebo and teriflunomide arm, respectively. While the issue of informative censoring due to high MRI 
activity for the primary endpoint analysis is addressed in this sensitivity analysis by counting high MRI 
activity as an event, the proportional hazards assumption is still clearly not fulfilled questioning the use 
of the HR as a valid effect measure. As for the primary time-to-first-confirmed-relapse analysis, the most 
informative part of the KM curve seems to be the time from week 24 to week 36/48.  
The  second  sensitivity  analysis,  “time  to  first  confirmed  clinical  relapse  occurring  after  the  PK  run-in 
phase”, that excluded clinical relapses that occurred during the PK run-in phase is considered of little 
value because censoring patients at time of relapse in the PK run-in is questionable from a statistical 
point of view. Additionally, from a clinical perspective, the analysis provides little information with regard 
to the benefit/ risk for use of teriflunomide without titration.  
For the analysis “time to relapse or high MRI activity” addressed as part of the pre-specified sensitivity 
analyses for the primary endpoint a post hoc analysis using placebo-based multiple imputations (jump 
to  reference)  to  handle  early  permanent  discontinuation  of  treatment/DB  period  to  assess  deviations 
from  the  non-informative  censoring  assumption  showed  similar  results  to  the  pre-planned  analysis, 
apparently due to the fact that only few patients discontinued without event.  
An additional post-hoc analysis considering interval censoring of the MRI component supported the pre-
planned analysis. Apparently, interval censoring seems less relevant for the actual data.  
Overall, a number of sensitivity analyses were performed, that showed stronger results than the primary 
analysis.  The  sensitivity  analyses  in  general  and  in  particular  the  one,  that  comprised  criteria  of  a 
composite  endpoint  by  counting  in  addition  to  relapse  also  high  MRI  activity  as  an  event  I  yielded 
significant  results,  although  only  nominally  since  the  primary  analysis  failed  to  show  statistical 
significance. However, especially this composite endpoint is considered to be of clinical relevance since 
switching patients to (another) active treatment when high disease activity is detected on MRI and not 
waiting for a relapse to occur reflects clinical practice.

With respect to the key secondary endpoints, number of new or enlarged T2 lesions and number of Gd-
enhancing T1 lesions, a (nominal) significant reduction in the rate of new or enlarged T2 lesions per MRI 
scan  was  demonstrated  with  teriflunomide,  compared  to  placebo  (4.7  and  10.5  lesions,  respectively, 
(p=0.0006), corresponding to a 55% reduction over the DB treatment period (rate ratio [RR]: 0.450; 
95% CI: 0.285 to 0.711).  
With regard to the requested sensitivity analysis the Applicant took the number of T2 lesions into account. 
A  (nominal)  significant  reduction  in  the  rate  of  new  or  enlarged  T2  lesions  per  MRI  scan  was 
demonstrated with teriflunomide, compared to placebo (3,6 and 5,4 lesions, respectively) (p=0.0446), 
corresponding to a 33% reduction over the DB treatment period (rate ratio [RR]: 0.665; 95%CI: 0.447 
to 0.990). The relative risk reduction in this analysis (with adjustment for baseline T2 lesion count) is 
considerably  lower  compared  to  the  55%  relative  reduction  in  the  pre-defined  analysis  (estimated 
without  adjusting  for  baseline  T2  lesion  count)  but  still  nominally  significant.  Due  to  given  baseline 
differences,  the  adjusted  analysis,  even  not  pre-specified,  is  considered  to  yield  a  more  accurate 
treatment effect estimate. 
Also, a (nominal) significant reduction in the rate of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions was demonstrated with 
teriflunomide (p<0.0001), compared to placebo (1.9 and 7.5 lesions, respectively), corresponding to a 
75% reduction at the end of the DB treatment period (RR: 0.253; 95% CI: 0.126 to 0.505). While post-
baseline, the mean number of T1 Gd-enhancing lesions in the teriflunomide group declined from 3.9 at 
baseline to 1.4, the mean number of T1 Gd-enhancing lesions in the placebo group increased from 3.9 
at baseline to 5.1.  
According to the study design, the effect of teriflunomide on relapses was planned to be corroborated by 
results on the number of new or enlarged T2 lesions as well as of Gd enhancing T1 lesions. Both of these 
endpoints  indicate  inflammatory  activity  and  have  been  associated  with  relapses.  Therefore,  these 
endpoints were chosen to be estimated as key secondary endpoints. From the results of these analyses 
it  can  be  interpreted  that  teriflunomide  has  a  clear  effect  on  inflammation  in  the  targeted  patient 
population.  However,  as  the  study  failed  its  primary  endpoint  and  multiplicity  was  planned  to  be 
controlled across primary and secondary endpoints via hierarchical testing, statistical significance was 
only achieved nominally. Requested post-hoc analyses for the key secondary endpoints showed that at 
week  36,  21  scans  were  performed  under  placebo  and  44  scans  under  teriflunomide.  When  ignoring 
these scans, similar results were obtained as in the pre-planned analyses. 
Additional post-hoc analyses were provided upon request for all MRI endpoints that included all available 
MRI assessments performed within 96 weeks after randomization (including those obtained after the DB 
period due to early treatment discontinuation or switch to OL teriflunomide treatment). According to the 
provided analyses 44 additional scans were included for placebo and 35 additional scans were included 
for teriflunomide as compared to the analysis of the DB period. The number of additional scans included, 
however, is relatively small as compared to the number of remaining missing scans until week 96. Hence, 
missing data imputation remains critical. 
Considering 21+44 scans at week 36, in total 4 x 57 + 21 = 249 scans would have been expected for 
placebo and 4 x 109 + 44 = 480 for teriflunomide, leading to 249 – 123 = 126 scans for placebo patients 
and 480 – 339 = 141 for teriflunomide patients that were missing in the reported analysis, of which 44 
and  35  scans  were  added  in  the  analysis  of  the  DB  and  OL  phase,  corresponding  to  35%  and  25%. 
Whereas  results  from  the  combined  data  of  DB  and  OL  phase  could  have  been  reassuring  and  even 
conservative  due  to  the  switch  from  placebo  to  the  active  treatment,  the  large  amount  of  remaining 
missing scans does not allow for a confirming conclusion. The Applicant confirmed that the additional 
value of the analyses including OL data is limited. However, overall, results are still supportive of the 
efficacy of teriflunomide on the key secondary MRI endpoints of new and enlarged T2 lesions and T1 Gd-
enhancing lesions per scan.

Further requested and provided post-hoc analyses suggest that the results do not appear to be robust 
when conservative missing data imputation is applied in a setting with large proportion of missing data 
in the DB period. 70% of placebo patients and 47% of teriflunomide patients had MRI data to be imputed. 
Referring to the number of missing scans, this lack of robustness cannot be rebutted by an analysis on 
all MRI scans, including those taken in the OL period, since the number of additional scans in the OL 
period remains small compared to the number of remaining missing scans. Whereas the large amount 
of missing data itself raises concerns about the robustness of the data, the analyses with imputed data 
considerably  reduced  the  treatment  effect  and,  consequently,  nominal  significance  was  lost.  This 
imputation approach is however considered too conservative. In addition, results still showed a relevant 
numerical effect.  
A further secondary endpoint was “the proportion of clinical relapse-free patients”. At week 96 59.4% of 
the patients in the teriflunomide treatment arm were relapse free compared to 45.5% under placebo. 
However,  the  KM  plots are almost parallel and  as the time to relapse rate (primary  endpoint) can be 
translated into relapse free rates, this outcome is not unexpected. 
Results  regarding  the  change  from  baseline  in  volume  of  T2  lesions  seem  to  be  in  favour  of 
teriflunomide. Results regarding unenhancing T1 lesions are difficult to interpret. Chronic or persistent 
T1-hypointense lesions (black holes) in MRI have been related to irreversible tissue loss in MS patients. 
However,  while  teriflunomide  led  to  (nominal)  significant  reduction  in  the  mean  number  of  new 
hypointense T1 lesions, evaluation of change from baseline in volume of hypointense T1 lesions did not 
indicate any advantage of teriflunomide over placebo. A decrease in the brain volume has been observed 
in both treatment groups. No statistical difference was observed between the teriflunomide and placebo 
groups on the percentage change in brain volume. The mean percent changes in brain volume from 
baseline to Week 96 (MMRM data) were -0.529 in the teriflunomide group and -0.570 in the placebo 
group.  With  respect  to  these  other  secondary  MRI  related  endpoints,  analyses  of  these  are  only 
exploratory and no confirmatory conclusions can be made based on the results for these endpoints.  
As to be expected in the paediatric MS population with a generally rather low disability progression, no 
relevant changes in EDSS scores were seen from study start until the end of the 96 weeks period. Results 
for the EDSS score were only descriptively summarized: the mean (SD) EDSS score at baseline was 1.4 
(0.9) and 1.2 (0.9) for the placebo and the teriflunomide treatment group, respectively, while at week 
96  the  mean  (SD)  EDSS  score  was  1.7  (1.2)  and  1.2  (0.9)  respectively,  representing  a  slight 
deterioration under placebo of 0.3.  Requested post-hoc analyses on CDP-6M, both for the DB treatment 
period and for the first 96 weeks regardless of patients discontinuing the double DB and switching to OL 
teriflunomide,  showed  that  only  few  patients  experienced  a  CDP-6M  in  the  DB  period  with  2  (3.5%) 
patients in the placebo group and 5 (4.6%) patients under teriflunomide treatment. However, due to the 
switch to OL rescue treatment which was disproportionately higher in the placebo group compared to 
the teriflunomide group these results are difficult to interpret. During the 96-week period, better results 
were provided for CDP-6M in the active treatment arm with 8 (14.0%) patients in the placebo group and 
9 (8.3%) patients in the teriflunomide group who experienced a CDP-6M. 
With respect to cognition, no statistical difference was observed between the teriflunomide and placebo 
groups on the change in number of completed items and correct substitutions measured by SDMT. No 
meaningful differences between groups were observed for the aforementioned cognitive battery tests.  
At Week 96, 6.4% of the patients in the teriflunomide group and 1.8% of the patients in the placebo 
group were disease free according to the defined criteria as stated in the statistical section. However, 
week 96 results are based on a very small number of patients that limit the overall conclusions. 
Results of the subgroup analyses were in favour of teriflunomide and overall consistent except for the 
subgroup of Black/Others patients, for the subgroup of patients from North America/North Africa region 
(these  2  different  regions  were  pooled  due  to  small  numbers  of  patients  and  numbers  of  relapses 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289596/2021  
Page 57/109 
 
 
 
 
experienced overall), and for the subgroup of patients who experienced 1 or 3 relapses overall. In the 
subgroup of patients with 2 relapses experienced overall before randomization teriflunomide significantly 
reduced the risk of a confirmed clinical relapse by 75.0% (HR: 0.250; 95% CI: 0.086 to 0.723). In the 
subgroup of patients with highly active disease at baseline teriflunomide significantly reduced the risk of 
a confirmed clinical relapse by 68.1% (HR: 0.319; 95% CI: 0.128 to 0.793). Overall, it has to be kept 
in mind, that subgroup analyses were based on the HR which is considered to be a less suitable effect 
measure in this setting. 
Subgroup analyses were also performed for the first sensitivity analysis “time to first confirmed clinical 
relapse or high MRI activity”. Results of the subgroup analyses were also in favour of teriflunomide and 
overall consistent except for the subgroup of Black/Others patients, for the subgroup of patients from 
North America/North Africa and for the subgroup of patients who experienced 3 relapses overall.  
152 patients were enrolled in the OL period: 100 patients in the teriflunomide/teriflunomide group and 
52 patients in the placebo/teriflunomide group. As of the data cut-off date, 30 patients had completed 
the  OL  period  (21  patients  in  the  teriflunomide/teriflunomide  group  and  9  patients  in  the 
placebo/teriflunomide  group)  and  88  patients  were  still  ongoing  (61  patients  and  27  patients, 
respectively). Limited efficacy data from this long-term extension period could be considered indicative, 
that  the  effect  of  teriflunomide  as  assessed  on  different  endpoints  during  the  maintenance  period  is 
comparable to that shown in the DB treatment period. However, due to the uncontrolled design of the 
OL period as well as due to the attrition bias, the extension period of study EFC11759 is generally of 
limited value with regard to efficacy. 
Regarding  the  extrapolation  exercise  using  data  from  the  adult  RMS  population  the  Applicant  has 
demonstrated that integration of the adult MRI data into the paediatric data population in a Bayesian 
way does not change the results considerably.  
Whereas approach 1 uses the age distribution from TERIKIDS to derive a prior from the adult studies 
relevant for this age distribution, approach 2 did not take age into account. Using different weighing of 
the adult data corresponding to different effective sample sizes, results were obtained similarly to the 
results from TERIKIDS study. Whereas approach 1 relies on the specific functional relation of the efficacy 
parameter to age, approach 2 prior relies on the assumption that efficacy is unrelated to age. Obviously, 
both assumptions are difficult to verify using adult data only, but similarity between the results of both 
approaches appears reassuring. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
Study EFC11759 included paediatric patients aged 10 to 18 years of age and therefore, no further data 
are needed. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In support of the extension of the indication of Aubagio to paediatric patients aged 10 to 17 years, the 
Applicant has provided efficacy data from one placebo-controlled study, study EFC11759, and its long-
term, OL period. 
The study failed its primary endpoint “time to first clinical relapse after randomization up to the end of 
the DB treatment period” and thus efficacy of teriflunomide in the paediatric population with RRMS has 
not been formally demonstrated. 
However,  with  regard  to  the  sensitivity  analysis  “time  to  first  confirmed  clinical  relapse  or  high  MRI 
activity  meeting  criteria  for  switching  into  OL  period,  whichever  came  first”,  which  is  of  high  clinical 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289596/2021  
Page 58/109 
 
 
 
 
relevance,  teriflunomide  yielded  a  nominally  statistically  significant  result  in  comparison  to 
placebo(p=0.0409). 
For the two key secondary MRI endpoints, number of new/newly enlarged T2 lesions and number of Gd-
enhancing T1 lesions nominal  significant reductions have been shown. As  the study  failed its primary 
endpoint and multiplicity was planned to be controlled across primary and key secondary endpoints via 
hierarchical testing, none of these two key secondary endpoints can be claimed “statistically significant” 
in  the  confirmatory  sense.  However,  since  these  MRI  parameters  have  been  related  to  relapses, 
representing the most important clinical effect in this population and are often among the criteria chosen 
to reflect disease activity, they are considered to be of high importance in this context and extrapolation 
of efficacy based on these endpoints can be accepted. 
Since efficacy of teriflunomide has already been demonstrated in adult patients with RRMS (teriflunomide 
is  approved  for  this  population),  extrapolation  from  the  adult  patient  population  to  the  paediatric 
population based on MRI based secondary endpoints is considered justified. Upon request, the Applicant 
provided analyses demonstrating that using adult data as an informative prior for a Bayesian analysis of 
the paediatric population based on MRI derived endpoints does not change the results considerably.  
Therefore, in light of all provided efficacy data and the results received, despite that the primary endpoint 
itself was not met, extrapolation of the adult indication to the paediatric population is considered justified. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The  safety  of  teriflunomide  was  assessed  against  placebo  in  paediatrics  aged  10  to  17  years  (both 
inclusive) based on the results of the  DB period in study EFC11759. Long-term safety data are so far 
limited  and  interim  data  derive  from  the  ongoing  OL  period  of  this  study  with  a  data  cut-off  of  27 
November 2019. Within this procedure, the Applicant provided an update of safety data for the OL period 
of the study summarised in a safety update report with a new data cut-off of 12 September 2020. Any 
numbers on exposure and safety data in the OL period in this report were updated accordingly. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 166 patients were randomized to study treatment in the DB period of study EFC11759: 109 
patients in the teriflunomide group and 57 patients in the placebo group.  
Initiation of teriflunomide in the DB and OL period was conducted with half the 14 mg adult equivalent 
dose  as  part  of  a  PK  run-in  phase  for  the  first  8 weeks,  i.e.  patients  BW  ≥40 kg  received  7 mg 
teriflunomide and patients BW <40 kg received 3.5 mg teriflunomide. Patients were then to be switched 
to the 14mg adult equivalent dose after the first 8 weeks on teriflunomide, depending on the outcome 
of the PK run-in phase, i.e. to 14 mg teriflunomide for patients BW ≥40 kg, and to 7 mg teriflunomide 
for patients BW <40 kg. 
Extent  of  exposure  was  presented  by  dose  in  the  teriflunomide  arm  (3.5 mg,  7 mg,  and  14 mg).  A 
majority of subjects was exposed to 14 mg teriflunomide (97 patients resulting in 131 PYE [patient-years 
of exposure]) and only 11 patients were exposed to 7 mg teriflunomide (resulting in 15 PYE), resulting 
in a total of 145.6 PYE, and 57 PYE for the placebo group. The median duration of treatment during the 
DB period was shorter for placebo (273.0 days) as compared to teriflunomide (660.0 days), which is a 
consequence of the provision of the study protocol, i.e. allowing all patients to switch from the DB period 
to the OL period in case of a RAP-confirmed clinical relapse, or high disease activity on MRI, or when 
reaching 96 weeks of follow up. The number of early switches in the placebo arm was higher than in the 
teriflunomide arm. Overall, the difference in exposure to placebo and teriflunomide during the study has 
to be taken into account when interpreting the safety data. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289596/2021  
Page 59/109 
 
 
 
 
Cumulatively, 100 (92%) and 73 (67%) of teriflunomide-treated paediatric patients were exposed to the 
drug  (any  dose)  for  more  than  six  months  and  more  than  one  year,  respectively.  Only  41  (38%)  of 
teriflunomide-treated patients received the drug for more than two years, thus limiting the availability 
of  controlled  long-term  safety  data.  The  cumulative  exposure  to  placebo  was  even  smaller  (only  10 
patients for more than 2 years). Exposure data by age category <13 years and ≥13 years reveal that 
the median duration of treatment is similar in both age categories for patients on placebo (299.5 days 
and  273.0 days)  and  slightly  higher  in  patients  <13  years  versus  those  ≥13  years  treated  with 
teriflunomide  (669 days  vs.  596 days).  A  similar  percentage  of  patients  in  both  age  categories  per 
treatment group had a cumulative duration of treatment more than six months and more than one year. 
A total of 152 patients (approximately 92%) were enrolled in the OL period of the study: 52 patients in 
the  placebo/teriflunomide  group  and  100  patients  in  the  teriflunomide  /teriflunomide  group.  The 
cumulative duration of treatment exposure from enrolment in the OL period to the updated data cut-off 
12 September 2020 was 30.53 patient-years at the teriflunomide 7 mg dose and 233.18 patient-years 
at the 14 mg dose. Most of the patients (132 patients) received 14 mg teriflunomide once daily. Up to 
the updated data cut-off, 84.1% and 49.2% of patients received teriflunomide 14 mg for ≥48 weeks and 
≥96 weeks, respectively, and 7 patients (5.3%) in the OL period were exposed to this dose for more 
than 168 weeks (i.e. 3.5 years). 
Regarding demographics, these were reflective of the intended paediatric MS study population regarding 
gender  distribution,  which  was  2:1  (female  to  male)  in  both  treatment  groups.  However,  limitations 
regarding  the  availability  of  data  concern  younger  paediatrics  and  those  being  pre-pubertal  thus 
hampering firm safety conclusions:  
•  Median  age  was  15 years.  Only  16%  (i.e.  26  of  166  patients,  16  on  teriflunomide  and  10  on 
placebo)  were  <13 years,  which  hampers  interpretability  of  safety  in  this  age  group.  A  more 
detailed breakdown of ages reveals a majority of patients in both treatment groups being 16 to 
17 years of age followed by patients aged 14 to 15 years.  
•  Only 10 patients (6 %) reflect Tanner Stage I, indicating that they were pre-pubertal (5 patients 
in each treatment group). 
Adverse events 
The  overall  presentation  of  safety  data  does  not  take  into  account  the  switch  from  half  the  adult 
equivalent  dose  to  the  full  adult  equivalent  dose  of  14 mg  after  the  first  8 weeks  of  treatment  with 
teriflunomide during the DB and OL period. Therefore, no data is available to rule out the occurrence of 
tolerability issues, such as nausea, diarrhoea, and alopecia, with a higher initial teriflunomide dose during 
the first 8 weeks of treatment. Upon request, the  Applicant provided an overview of TEAEs in the DB 
period for the first 8 weeks of treatment (i.e., based on half the adult equivalent dose) compared to the 
second  8 weeks  (i.e.,  based  on  the  full  adult  equivalent  dose).  TEAEs  in  general  and  specifically  the 
potential tolerability issues in line with nausea and alopecia were more frequently reported within the 
first 8 weeks of treatment. At present, there is no evidence for an increased incidence of such TEAEs or 
early  discontinuations  between  Week 8  and  Week 16  (based  on  the  full  adult  equivalent  dose)  as 
compared to the first 8 weeks of treatment (half the adult equivalent dose). Moreover, based on the PK 
of teriflunomide (slow increase in concentration and long elimination half-life of 19 days) the 14 mg adult 
equivalent dose is not expected to substantially increase the risk for tolerability issues. 
Slightly more patients in the teriflunomide group reported TEAEs as compared to those in the placebo 
group (88.1% vs. 82.5%) during the DB period.  
Assessment report

During the OL period, slightly more patients who were treated with placebo during the DB period 
reported TEAEs (86.5% in the placebo/ teriflunomide group and 79% in the teriflunomide/ 
teriflunomide group).  
Display of adverse events 
The most frequently reported TEAEs derived from the following System Organ Class (SOCs) that were 
reported more frequently in the teriflunomide group than in the placebo group (difference of ≥5%) during 
the DB period:  
• 
Infections  and  infestations  (66.1%  in  the  teriflunomide  group  and  45.6%  in  the  placebo  group), 
driven  by  respiratory  tract  preferred  terms  (PTs),  i.e.  nasopharyngitis  (25.7%  and  8.8%),  upper 
respiratory tract infection (21.1% and 10.5%), pharyngitis and bronchitis. 
•  Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (35.8% and 22.8%), driven by alopecia (21% teriflunomide 
vs. 12% placebo). 
•  Gastrointestinal disorders (33% and 24.6%), driven by abdominal pain (11% vs. 1.8%) 
• 
Investigations  (24.8%  and  14%),  driven  by  laboratory  abnormalities,  i.e.  blood  creatine 
phosphokinase (CPK) increased (5.5% vs. 0%), white blood cell count decreased (3.7% vs. 1.8%), 
neutrophil count decreased (2.8% vs. 0%), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (2.8% vs. 
1.8%). 
•  General disorders and administration site conditions (18.3% and 12.3%), and Musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders (15.6% and 8.8%), and Metabolism and nutrition disorders (9.2% and 
3.5%).  
SOCs reported with a similar incidence in patients on teriflunomide and placebo were: nervous system 
disorders (33.9% and 33.3%; [headache occurred more frequently on placebo (22.8%) vs. teriflunomide 
(16.5%),  while  paresthesia  occurred  in  11%  of  subjects  on  teriflunomide  vs.  1.8%  of  subjects  on 
placebo]),  respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  (18.3%  and  15.8%),  injury,  poisoning  and 
procedural  complications  (15.6%  and  19.3%),  psychiatric  disorders  (11%  and  14%),  eye  disorders 
(10.1% and 15.8%), and reproductive system and breast disorders (3.7% and 10.5%). 
For other SOCs, where an increased reporting was noted in patients on teriflunomide, PTs do not indicate 
a specific cluster. 
TEAEs  at  the  SOC  level  reported  more  frequently  in  the  placebo/  teriflunomide  group  than  in  the 
teriflunomide/  teriflunomide  group  (with  a  difference  of  ≥5%)  during  the  OL  period  were:  Nervous 
system disorders (32.7% versus 24%), Gastrointestinal disorders (30.8% versus 26.0%), Respiratory, 
thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  (23.1%  versus  11.0%),  Investigations  (28.8%  versus  17%), 
Psychiatric disorders (17.3% versus 8.0%), and Renal and urinary disorders (11.5% versus 3.0%). No 
TEAEs at the SOC level were reported more frequently in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group than in 
the  placebo/  teriflunomide  group  with  a  ≥  5%  difference.  TEAEs  from  the  Infections  and  infestations 
SOC occurred in a similar magnitude in patients on teriflunomide/ teriflunomide (53.0%) and patients 
on placebo/ teriflunomide (48.1%). 
PTs reported more frequently in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group than in the placebo/ teriflunomide 
group (with a difference of ≥5% by decreasing order in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group) were: 
upper respiratory tract infection (19.0% and 13.5%), respiratory tract infection (5.0% and none), PTs 
reported  more  frequently  in  the  placebo/teriflunomide  group  than  in  the  teriflunomide/  teriflunomide 
group (with a difference of ≥5% by decreasing order in the placebo/ teriflunomide group) were: alopecia 
(17.3% versus 10.0%), ALT increased (15.4% versus 3.0%), dizziness (11.5% versus 2.0%), depression

(7.7%  and  1.0%),  hypoesthesia  (7.7%  and  2.0%),  micturition  urgency  (7.7%  and  none),  bronchitis 
(5.8% and none), and asthma (5.8% and none). 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
Gastrointestinal disorders – nausea and diarrhoea 
During  the  DB  period,  the  incidence  of  nausea  as  well  as  diarrhoea/  frequent  bowel  movements  was 
similar  in  the  teriflunomide  and  placebo  group  (8.3%  and  7.3%  versus  7%  and  7%).  No  increase  in 
nausea and diarrhoea TEAEs in neither group was noted during the OL period: placebo/ teriflunomide 
(5.8%  and  9.6%)  and  teriflunomide/  teriflunomide  (4%  and  6%).  During  the  DB  period,  nausea  was 
most frequently reported within the first week while diarrhoea was most frequently reported after 4 to 
12 weeks of treatment. 
Hepatic disorders (including liver function parameter) 
Liver  function:  No  clinically  relevant  differences  between  groups  during  the  DB  and  OL  periods  were 
observed for changes over time of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), lactate 
dehydrogenase, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), total bilirubin, and indirect bilirubin. An increase 
in mean ALT was observed in the teriflunomide group compared to the placebo group starting at Week 4 
during  DB  treatment.  ALT  >  1x  upper  limit  of  normal  (ULN)  (ALT  >  3x  ULN)  was  reported  in  25.7% 
(3.7%) of patients on teriflunomide and 14% (0%) of patients on placebo. Mean ALT also increased in 
the placebo/ teriflunomide  group  over the first  weeks  of  treatment during OL,  but  also initially  in  the 
teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group. The proportion of patients with ALT >1x ULN in postbaseline visits 
was lower in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group than in the placebo/ teriflunomide group (35% vs. 
48.1%) but higher as compared to the teriflunomide group in the DB period. 
Hepatic TEAEs: During the DB period, the incidence of hepatic disorders was similar in the teriflunomide 
and  placebo  group.  The  most  frequently  reported  treatment-emergent  hepatic  disorder  was  ALT 
increased  (2.8%  in  the  teriflunomide  group  and  1.8%  in  the  placebo  group).  Two  patients  in  the 
teriflunomide group experienced serious but asymptomatic hepatic disorders of ALT increased (Day 171) 
and  transaminases  increased  (Day 429;  graded  “severe”)  that  did  not  lead  to  permanent  treatment 
discontinuation,  and  recovered  with  normalization  of  hepatic  enzyme  levels.  One  patient  in  the 
teriflunomide group experienced hepatic disorders (ALT increased) after Day 138 that led to treatment 
discontinuation.  The  patient  recovered  with  ALT  normalisation  after  teriflunomide  discontinuation  and 
accelerated  elimination  procedure.  The  other  patients  with  treatment-emergent  hepatic  disorders 
experienced nonserious hepatic events: 2 in the teriflunomide group (increases of hepatic enzymes) and 
2 in the placebo group (hyperbilirubinaemia and ALT increased). 
Most hepatic disorder TEAEs were recorded between 4 and 12 weeks in the teriflunomide group but also 
occurred  later  during  treatment.  Hepatic  disorder  TEAEs  with  teriflunomide  occur  dose-related. 
Therefore, it needs to be taken into account that patients received half the adult-equivalent dose during 
the first 8 weeks of treatment. 
During the OL period, hepatic disorders were less frequently reported in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide 
group than in the placebo/ teriflunomide group and the vast majority had TEAEs from the investigations 
SOC  (ALT  increased:  3.0%  and  15.4%,  respectively).  The  incidence  of  TEAEs  in  the  latter  treatment 
group was higher compared to teriflunomide in the DB period.  
Three  patients  in  the  placebo/  teriflunomide  group  experienced  serious  hepatic  disorders  leading  to 
treatment discontinuation: 1 patient had hepatic function abnormal of severe intensity and ALT increased 
(430 IU/L) of moderate intensity, 1 patient had serious ALT increased (391 UI/L) of moderate intensity 
and nonserious transaminases increased of moderate intensity, and 1 patient had serious ALT increased 
(278 UI/L) of moderate intensity. For the latter patient, the diagnosis was “drug-induced liver injury” 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289596/2021

(DILI) as per the narrative. The patient was treated with minocycline until 1.5 months before onset of 
the ALT increase, however, the half-life of minocycline questions a contribution to this event. In addition, 
2 patients discontinued due to non-serious hepatic disorder TEAEs. All patients recovered up to the cut-
off date of the OL period.  
No cases of Hy’s law were reported throughout the study.  
The  potential  of  teriflunomide  to  induce  DILI  has  been  assessed  in  variation  procedures 
EMEA/H/C/002514/II/0029  and  EMEA/H/C/002514/II/0032.  Based  on  the  presentation  and  review  of 
available nonclinical and clinical data summarised by the Applicant in a safety evaluation report, there is 
sufficient evidence to support a causal association. Severe cases of DILI including life-threatening cases 
of liver failure have occurred for which a causal role of teriflunomide is at least possible (or even likely). 
Thus, the approved changes in section 4.4 of the product information reflect cases of DILI, risk factors 
for  liver  enzyme  increases  and  DILI,  and  monitoring  algorithm.  Given  that  the  hepatic  safety  of 
teriflunomide was found similar in paediatrics in study EFC11759, hepatic enzyme monitoring “at least 
every four weeks during the first 6 months of treatment and regularly thereafter” is likewise acceptable 
in paediatrics in the absence of risk factors (i.e. patients with  pre-existing liver disorder, concomitant 
treatment with other hepatotoxic drugs, and/or consumption of substantial quantities of alcohol). 
Pancreatic disorders and laboratory (pancreatic enzyme) parameters 
Pancreatic function 
No relevant differences between groups were observed for changes over time of mean lipase and amylase 
values in the DB and OL period. 
Pancreatic disorders TEAEs 
included TEAEs in line with pancreatic enzyme increases but also cases of pancreatitis, and were reported 
in 4 patients (3.7%) in the teriflunomide group and 1 patient (1.8%) in the placebo group during the DB 
period (Table 14). Two of the TEAEs in the teriflunomide group were coded as “pancreatitis acute”. Most 
of the events occurred between 60 and 84 weeks after treatment initiation with teriflunomide. In 3 of 
the 4 patients on teriflunomide, pancreatic TEAEs led to treatment discontinuation: one serious case of 
acute  pancreatitis  of  moderate  intensity  in  a  patient  with  congenital  anomaly  of  cystic  duct  requiring 
hospitalization, one nonserious case of acute (caudal) pancreatitis with autoimmune features of severe 
intensity and one nonserious case of hyperlipasaemia of mild intensity. The patients were recovered or 
recovering.

Note: Table sorted by SOC internationally agreed order and by decreasing frequency of PT in teriflunomide treatment group 
During the OL period, 5 patients (5%) in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group, and 1 patient (1.9%) 
in the placebo/ teriflunomide group reported pancreatic disorders TEAEs; overall, it concerned 6 patients 
(3.9% in total). Two of these six patients, both in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group, experienced 
SAEs  in  line  with  pancreatitis  that  led  to  hospitalisation,  corrective  treatment  and  discontinuation  of 
teriflunomide. Both were accompanied by symptoms and confirmed by imaging data: 
•  One patient was reported with pancreatitis acute (lipase increased at 16.15 x ULN) of severe intensity 
after approx. 1 year of teriflunomide treatment. In this patient, abdominal imaging revealed acute 
pancreatitis with pancreatic nodules (pseudo-papilloma) and inflammatory lesions of the pancreas. 
This  inflammatory  process  was  coded  as  pancreatic  neoplasm  but  was  not  rated  related  to 
teriflunomide  despite  the  lack  of  confirming  data  (e.g.  biopsy  results).  Thus,  contribution  of 
teriflunomide to this condition can neither be confirmed nor ruled out. 
•  One  patient  with  pancreatitis  (abdominal  pain  with  lipase  and  amylase  increase)  of  moderate 
intensity after approx. 3 years of teriflunomide, which was reported to have been recovered. 
Nonserious  pancreatitis  of  mild  intensity  leading  to  treatment  discontinuation  (and  accelerated 
elimination procedure) was reported in an additional patient. The event was associated with nonserious 
amylase  >2x  ULN  and  nonserious  lipase  >2x  ULN.  The  patient  presented  an  abdominal  ultrasound 
revealing increased echogenicity. The event was stated as “recovering”.  
No case of pancreatitis was reported in the placebo/ teriflunomide group. 
Other TEAEs in line with pancreatic disorders during the OL period were: 
•  One  patient  in  the  teriflunomide/  teriflunomide  group  experienced  nonserious  increase  in  both 
amylase and lipase ≥ 2x ULN of mild intensity after approx. 2.5 years of teriflunomide (considered 
related). The patient recovered. Another patient had nonserious amylase increased of mild intensity 
considered related to teriflunomide. The patient had not recovered at the time of the cut-off date of 
the report. 
•  A  single  patient  in  the  placebo/  teriflunomide  group  was  reported  with  nonserious  asymptomatic 
lipase increase ≥ 2x ULN after approx. 2 years of treatment with teriflunomide in the OL period (not 
considered  related).  The  patient  was  reinitiated  on  teriflunomide  after  temporary  interruption. 
However, no information on re-challenge is available. 
Comparison of pancreatic effects in adults and paediatrics – results from the safety evaluation report 
A  detailed  safety  evaluation  report  aimed  to  address  the  observed  imbalance  of  pancreatic  events 
detected in study EFC11759 and those seen in adult clinical trials on pancreatitis sources of information 
included epidemiological data on pancreatitis, review of nonclinical, clinical and postmarketing (safety

database, excluding paediatrics) data, literature review, and disproportionality analyses using external 
databases: 
•  Epidemiological data from the Real-World Evidence Database Optum Humedica indicate an increased 
incidence rate of pancreatitis per 1000 person-years in MS patients versus non-MS controls that is 
more pronounced in patients 10 to 18 years.  
•  Comparative epidemiological review of background rates in adults and paediatrics (using literature 
sources) and teriflunomide post-marketing data for adult patients with MS as well as clinical study 
data of MS paediatric patients in EFC11759 reveal that the incidence of pancreatitis in teriflunomide-
treated  adults  is  higher  compared  to  adult  background  rates  (74.9/100,000  vs.  45/100,000); 
moreover, in teriflunomide-treated paediatrics the incidence of pancreatitis is much higher compared 
to background paediatric rates (4/166, i.e. 3% vs. 1/10.000). 
•  Detailed review of the Sanofi GPV database found 276 cases (322 events) of which two-third were 
serious. The majority of cases (i.e. patients) are reports of pancreatitis (n=176) and n=100 cases 
are  reports  of  pancreatic  enzyme  increases.  In  approx.  half  of  the  cases,  teriflunomide  was 
discontinued.  Among  pancreatitis  events  in  the  GPV  database,  there  were  2  events  coded  as 
“pancreatic  pseudocyst”  and  1  event  of  “pancreatitis  necrotising”.  Of  the  322  events,  106  led  to 
hospitalisation and 116 were rated as medically significant events. For one patient, the outcome was 
“disability”; however, this coding was probably not related to pancreatitis but to the description of 
MS. Recovery from events was irregularly reported. Median time-to-onset of events was 1.4 years. 
Causality analysis per WHO-UMC criteria of n= 176 cases revealed 2 cases rated as likely related 
(published case reports) and one case possibly related. 4 other cases that were rated as possibly 
related 
to 
teriflunomide 
have 
already 
been 
assessed 
previously 
during 
EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010135/201503 and led to labelling revision with regard to pancreatitis. Two 
fatal events were reported but causality assessed these events as unlikely related to teriflunomide. 
•  External database evaluation/ disproportionality  
Analyses  found  a  clear  signal  for  the  TEAEs  of  pancreatitis  and  lipase  increased  in  both  databases 
(VigiBase  and  FDA  Adverse  Event  Reporting  System-FAERS).  Borderline  signal  derived  from  acute 
pancreatitis (standardised MedDRA queries [SMQ]) [narrow] and pancreatic enzymes increased.  
Overall, the presentation of data on pancreatic effects in paediatrics cannot rule out that teriflunomide 
plays a contributing role in the occurrence of pancreatitis. Monitoring of pancreatic enzymes at treatment 
initiation and regularly during treatment in clinical practise is not based on a scientific rationale and thus 
not  warranted;  obtaining  pancreatic  enzymes  and  related  laboratory  parameters  in  patients  with 
suspected pancreatitis appears to best address this identified risk.  Information on the risk of pancreatitis 
in  paediatric  patients  and  respective  recommendations  have  been  included  in  the  SmPC,  section  4.4. 
Moreover, post-marketing follow-up of pancreatitis is in place by means of a dedicated targeted follow-
up form. Specific questions include de- and re-challenge and any known results of genetic tests indicating 
an  increased  risk  for  pancreatitis  as  well  as  a  question  about  any  anatomic  anomalies  potentially 
associated with pancreatitis. 
Bone marrow disorders 
All events in both periods were of mild or moderate intensity. No discontinuations due to bone marrow 
disorders were reported during the study. 
During  the  DB  period,  the  incidence  of  bone  marrow  disorders  was  higher  in  the  teriflunomide  group 
(7.3%) than in the placebo group (1.8%) with the most frequently reported TEAEs being neutropenia 
(2.8%),  leukopenia  (1.8%),  and  monocytopenia  (1.8%)  in  the  SOC  Blood  and  lymphatic  system 
disorders, and white blood cell count decreased (3.7%), and neutrophil count decreased (2.8%) in the 
Assessment report

SOC Investigations. The events and mainly occurred between 12 and 24 weeks after treatment initiation. 
One  adolescent  patient  in  the  teriflunomide  group  with  a  known  pre-existing  cyclic  neutropenia  at 
baseline  experienced  serious  neutropenia  of  moderate  intensity  on  Day 137  (rated  related  to 
teriflunomide). Teriflunomide was temporarily interrupted. The patient recovered.  
Bone marrow disorders were more frequently reported in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group than in 
the placebo/ teriflunomide groups (6.0% and 3.8%) during the OL period. The most commonly reported 
TEAE  was white blood cell  count decreased  (3% and  3.8%) and  neutrophil  count decreased (2% and 
1.9%).  The  patient  with  a  known  pre-existing  cyclic  neutropenia  experienced  serious  neutropenia  of 
moderate  intensity.  The  patient  recovered.  However,  2  of  7  patients  with  non-serious  bone  marrow 
disorder TEAEs were not recovered by the data cut-off in the OL period. 
Infections and infestations 
The proportion of patients with infections and infestations TEAEs was higher in the teriflunomide group 
(66.1%) than in the placebo group (45.6%). The most frequently reported infection TEAEs (≥5% at PT 
level  in  any  treatment  groups)  were  nasopharyngitis,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection,  influenza,  and 
pharyngitis which were more frequently reported in the teriflunomide group, and gastroenteritis which 
was more frequently reported in the placebo group. 
Two of three infection serious AEs (SAEs) occurred in the teriflunomide group. One of these SAEs was 
an  opportunistic  infection  (pulmonary  tuberculosis)  in  a  patient  from  China  during  a  tuberculosis 
epidemic  and  led  to  discontinuation  from  treatment.  The  patient  recovered  from  tuberculosis  after 
antiinfective  treatment.  The  second  SAE  in  the  teriflunomide  group  was  an  upper  respiratory  tract 
infection  reported  as  serious  due  to  hospitalisation  related  to  concomitant  MS  relapse,  but  it  was  not 
serious by itself. Most cases of infections and infestations were of mild to moderate intensity with a peak 
in  reporting  between  Week 4  and  24.  Four  cases  were  severe  (upper  respiratory  tract  infection, 
pulmonary  tuberculosis  and  pilonidal  cyst  in  the  teriflunomide  group  and  appendicitis  in  the  placebo 
group). 
No increased occurrence of infections was reported during the OL period (53.0% in the teriflunomide/ 
teriflunomide  group  and  50%  in  the  placebo/  teriflunomide  group)  with  PTs  similar  to  the  DB  period. 
5 patients reported SAEs up to the updated data cut-off in the OL period, three of them in the placebo/ 
teriflunomide  group  being  rather  unspecific  in  nature  (bronchitis/  tonsillitis,  sinusitis,  and  food 
poisoning). The following SAEs were reported in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group: 
•  A patient for whom a SAE of upper respiratory tract infection was reported during the DB period. 
After approx. 20 months of teriflunomide treatment, the patient was reported with two serious TEAEs 
of  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  and  central  nervous  system  infection,  which  was  not  further 
specified.  The  patient  was  in  need  for  hospitalisation  and  corrective  antiinfective  treatment.  The 
patient experienced an additional SAE (lung infection, “pneumonia”) approximately 100 days after 
recovery  from  the  CNS  infection.  None  of  the  reported  SAEs  for  this  patient  was  rated  related  to 
teriflunomide.  
• 
The same patient was reported with a further SAE of upper respiratory tract infection of mild intensity 
upon data cut-off 12 September 2020.  
•  Coronavirus  infection  of  moderate  intensity  (in  a  patient  who  experienced  evocative  signs  of 
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) infection and was tested positive; this patient recovered with 
symptomatic treatment while teriflunomide was continued as planned). 
TEAEs  related  to  opportunistic  infections  were  similarly  reported  for  patients  on  placebo  and 
teriflunomide in the DB period, i.e. in 5.3% and 4.6% of patients, with the most frequently reported PT

being tinea versicolour (3.5% and 0.9% of patients), followed by oral herpes (1.8% of patients in each 
group). Pulmonary tuberculosis and herpes simplex each occurred in a single subject on teriflunomide.  
Overall,  5  of  the  152  patients  (3.3%)  treated  with  teriflunomide  in  the  OL  period  experienced 
opportunistic infections, more frequently reported in the placebo/ teriflunomide group compared to the 
teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group (5.8% vs. 2.0%, respectively). Each of the reported PTs occurred in 
a  single  subject  and  included  herpes  virus  infection,  oral  herpes,  and  varicella  in  the  P/T  group  and 
herpes zoster in the T/T group. The mycoplasma infection and the CNS infection were reported in the 
T/T group. CNS infection was the only serious opportunistic infection in the OL period. 
No infections and infestations TEAEs led to treatment discontinuation. 
Hypersensitivity and severe skin reactions  
No AE were reported in EFC11759 until data cut-off. 
Malignancies 
No cases of malignancies were reported during the DB period. During the OL period, one patient in the 
teriflunomide/  teriflunomide  group  experienced  acute  pancreatitis  with  pancreatic  nodules  (pseudo-
papilloma; benign lesion) coded as pancreatic neoplasm of severe intensity. The patient had stabilised 
but not recovered from pancreatic neoplasm after treatment discontinuation and AEP initiation. Although, 
two  tumour  markers  were  reported  to  be  negative  (i.e.  CA125  and  CA  19-9),  biopsy  results  are  not 
available. Therefore, a malignant condition cannot be ruled out. 
Blood pressure and hypertension 
Blood pressure (BP): slight mean increases for (supine) systolic (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) were noted 
from baseline to EOT in the teriflunomide group (mean change 4mm Hg and 3 mm Hg, respectively). 
Slightly  more  patients  reported  high  potentially  clinically  significant  abnormalities  (PCSAs)  for  supine 
DBP and SBP in the teriflunomide group. In the OL period, the changes in the placebo/ teriflunomide and 
in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group were small and similar between groups. 
Hypertension:  No  hypertension  TEAEs  were  reported  in  teriflunomide-treated  patients  during  the  DB 
period; one patient experienced non-serious hypertension in the placebo group. 
During OL, hypertension was only reported in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group (3 patients, 3.0%). 
2  of  3  patients  with  hypertension  TEAEs  received  corrective  treatment  (calcium  channel  blocker  in  1 
patient and calcium channel blocker plus angiotensin 2 receptor inhibitor in 1 patient) and recovered. 
Initial onset of hypertension was within 24 weeks. None of the cases was serious or led to treatment 
discontinuation.  
Cardiac arrhythmias 
No cases of cardiac arrhythmias were reported in the DB and the OL periods. 
Pulmonary disorders 
The highest percentage of treatment-emergent pulmonary disorders had an initial onset between 12 to 
24 weeks. No cases of interstitial lung disorders were reported during the study. 
More patients in the teriflunomide group than in the placebo group reported pulmonary disorders (63.3% 
vs.  43.9%).  Most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  (≥5%  at  PT  level  in  any  treatment  groups)  were 
nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, influenza, pharyngitis, oropharyngeal pain, and cough. 
Three  SAEs  in  total  included  two  severe  TEAEs  in  the  teriflunomide  group  (upper  respiratory  tract 
infection and pulmonary tuberculosis (leading to treatment discontinuation)) and asthma in the placebo 
group. All other events were of mild or moderate intensity. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289596/2021  
Page 67/109 
 
 
 
 
During  the  OL  period,  the  reporting  of  TEAEs  probably  related  to  pulmonary  disorders  was  similar 
between groups (51% in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group and 46.2% in the placebo/ teriflunomide 
group), which was lower as compared to the DB period and again driven by TEAEs from the infections 
and infestations SOC. Likewise, 3 out of 5 patients with pulmonary disorder SAEs reported events in line 
with (respiratory tract) infections (teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group: lung infection of severe intensity 
and upper respiratory tract infection of mild intensity; placebo/ teriflunomide group: acute sinusitis of 
moderate intensity and bronchitis and tonsillitis of mild intensity). Two patients reported asthma as SAE 
that led to hospitalisation and corrective treatment, while IMP was continued. Both patients recovered 
from asthma and in both of them IMP was not rated related to the SAE based on the medical history of 
the patients, i.e. asthma, or hyperexcitability syndrome and allergies. 
Embolic and thrombotic events 
One patient in the teriflunomide group experienced nonserious “weakened left side” on Day 610 of the 
study,  which  was  coded  as  hemiparesis  (rated  not  related  to  teriflunomide).  The  event  was  of  mild 
intensity and resolved within approximately 2 months. No TEAEs were reported during the OL period. 
Haemorrhage 
TEAEs regarding haemorrhages from any SOC were similarly reported between placebo and teriflunomide 
(5.3% and 7.3%). The most frequently reported PT with teriflunomide was nonserious contusion (3.7% 
vs 0%) of mild intensity. Cases were all related to accidental fall or sport. None of them led to treatment 
discontinuation. One case of gastrointestinal haemorrhage (haemorrhage of lower digestive tract-mild) 
was  reported  in  the  teriflunomide  group  on  Day 361.  Prior  laboratory  results  in  this  patient  were 
decreases  in  white  blood  cell  (WBC)  and  platelet  counts.  The  event  of  gastrointestinal  haemorrhage 
(considered not related to teriflunomide by the Investigator) resolved within 1 month without corrective 
treatment and with continuation of teriflunomide. A single event of non-serious contusion was reported 
during the OL period in a patient in the placebo/ teriflunomide group. The event was of mild intensity. 
Peripheral neuropathy 
One (0.9%) patient in the teriflunomide group and 1 (1.8%) patient in the placebo group experienced 
treatment-emergent peripheral neuropathy during the DB period none of them being serious. The event 
in the teriflunomide group was of severe intensity (arm neuralgic pain coded as neuralgia), occurred at 
Day 305, resolved within 32 days (with corrective treatment), and was not considered related to IMP. 
The  event  in  the  placebo  group  was  of  mild  to  moderate  intensity  (neuropathy  peripheral).  Nerve 
conduction was not performed in the two patients.  
Two  patients  in  the  placebo/  teriflunomide  group  (3.8%)  and  3  patients  in  the  teriflunomide/ 
teriflunomide group (3%) experienced peripheral neuropathy during the OL period, all of them recovered. 
All events were non-serious including neuralgia of mild intensity and sensory loss of mild intensity as 
well as moderate sensory disturbance in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group, and neuralgia of mild 
intensity  and  neuropathy  peripheral  of  moderate  intensity  in  the  placebo/  teriflunomide  group.  The 
peripheral neuropathy led to treatment discontinuation. In this patient, electromyogram findings were 
concordant with polyneuropathic involvement characterised by mild loss of axons, predominantly in the 
lower extremities and sensory fibres. 
Convulsions 
The incidence of convulsions was similar in both groups during the DB phase (1.8% in the teriflunomide 
and 3.5% in the placebo group). One SAE (2 episodes of epilepsy) in the teriflunomide group was rated 
as not related given that this patient had a medical history of epilepsy. This patient is still treated in the 
OL period. No convulsion events were reported during the OL period.

Alopecia/ hair loss 
Alopecia,  frequently  reported  as  hair  loss  and  mainly  temporarily-occurring,  was  more  frequently 
observed with teriflunomide as compared to placebo (22.0% vs. 12.3%) during the DB period. None of 
the  cases  was  serious  or  led  to  treatment  discontinuation.  In  the  teriflunomide  group,  alopecia  was 
reported to have had an initial onset within 12 and 24 weeks. 
During the OL period, alopecia was more frequently reported in the placebo/ teriflunomide group (17.3%) 
as compared to the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide (10.0%). All the events were nonserious. A single event 
of alopecia areata led to treatment discontinuation in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group. A majority 
of events were recovered or were recovering at the cut-off date of this report. Among the 18 patients 
reporting alopecia as per the first data cut-off, hair loss was reported 7 times (4 times in the placebo/ 
teriflunomide  group  and  3 times  in  the  teriflunomide/  teriflunomide  group)  and  modification  of  hair 
quality (thinner) was reported once in the placebo/ teriflunomide group. 
Psychiatric disorders 
During  the  DB  period  of  EFC11759,  reports  of  TEAEs  related  to  psychiatric  disorders  were  similar  in 
patients on teriflunomide and placebo (13.8% vs. 14%), the most frequently reported TEAE being anxiety 
(3.7% vs. 5.3%). No case was serious. One patient on teriflunomide discontinued IMP due to an event 
of  affective  disorder  on  the  first  day  of  dosing  together  with  a  MS  relapse.  Teriflunomide  was  rated 
related to this event, which is rather unlikely given the time course and MS relapse being a confounder. 
During  the  OL  period,  TEAEs  related  to  psychiatric  disorders  were  more  frequently  reported  in  the 
placebo/  teriflunomide  as  compared  to  the  teriflunomide/  teriflunomide  group  (19.2%  vs.  9%),  and 
headed by depression (7.7% vs. 1%). Although, this frequency is higher than in both treatment groups 
during the DB period, the overall numbers of patients with depression TEAEs are small. A single SAE of 
affective disorder (emotional disorder of childhood) was reported together with self-harming tendencies 
after 8 months of  treatment with teriflunomide during the OL  period.  Emotional  disorder of  childhood 
was confirmed by psychiatric consultation and required hospitalisation and corrective treatment, while 
teriflunomide  was continued.  The status of  the  patient was  “not  recovered”.  Although, this  this event 
was rated as not related to teriflunomide by the investigator, a contributing role cannot be ruled out.  
Pregnancies 
During the DB period, a single pregnancy was reported in a patient, who underwent elective abortion. 
During  the  OL  period,  two  pregnancies  were  reported:  one  patient  after  approximately  1  month  of 
treatment with teriflunomide. At this time, the patient was within the first weeks of the pregnancy. No 
wash-out was followed and the patient delivered a healthy infant with no signs of malformations. Another 
patient in the placebo/ teriflunomide group became pregnant and underwent termination of pregnancy. 
The  occurrence  of  undesired  pregnancies  is  of  special  importance  in  adolescents  and  therefore,  key 
elements were included in the HCP guide and in the patient card as risk minimisation measures (RMMs) 
Overdose 
Accidental overdose and/or overdose was defined in the protocol as at least twice the intended dose (i.e. 
2 tablets) on a given calendar day (within 24 hours). Accidental overdose was reported in a total of 8 
patients (4.6% in the teriflunomide group and 5.3% in the placebo group) during the DB period of the 
study. None was associated with clinical symptoms. 
A total of 10 patients, 8 (8.0%) patients in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group and 2 (3.8%) patients 
in  the  placebo/  teriflunomide  group  reported  accidental  overdose  (intake  of  2 tablets  in  less  than 
24 hours)  during  the  OL  period.  None  was  associated  with  clinical  symptoms.  In  one  patient  in  the 
teriflunomide/  teriflunomide  group,  an  SAE  was  reported  related  to  suicide  attempt  leading  to

hospitalisation. This patient experienced sensory disorders and tingling sensations for less than 2 hours 
and recovered after temporary teriflunomide discontinuation. 
Comparison of the safety of teriflunomide in paediatrics and adults (incl. laboratory abnormalities) 
The key safety issues pertaining to teriflunomide 14 mg in paediatrics (from EFC11759) are compared 
to adult safety data (derived from Pool A1, including Studies 2001, EFC6049/TEMSO, EFC10531/TOWER 
and EFC6260/TOPIC) in Table 15. Data interpretation should consider the overall difference in subjects 
included and the difference in exposure to placebo in both populations. The exposure to placebo in the 
paediatric population was shorter given that patients were given the option to receive teriflunomide OL.

A higher reporting was noted in paediatrics vs. adults for the following TEAEs in the teriflunomide vs. the 
placebo group: 
• 
Pancreatic disorders TEAEs were reported in 3.7% (4 patients) in the teriflunomide and 1.8% (1 
patient) in the placebo group in Study EFC11759 (DB period), and in 2.7% in the teriflunomide 
and 2.8% in the placebo group in adults. Events of (acute) pancreatitis included in these numbers 
amount  to  1.8%  (2  patients)  in  the  teriflunomide  and  none  in  the  placebo  group  in  Study 
EFC11759, and to 0.2% (2 patients) in the teriflunomide and 0.4% (4 patients) in the placebo 
group in adults. Three additional cases of pancreatitis (acute) were reported during the OL period 
(see AESI section). Pancreatic TEAEs in adults were reported with a similar incidence (2.7% on 
teriflunomide vs. 2.8% on placebo). Cases of pancreatitis in adults on teriflunomide leading to 
labelling revision were reported post-marketing (see summary of the Safety Evaluation Report). 
•  An increased frequency of infections was observed in paediatrics on teriflunomide vs. placebo 
but  not  in  adults.  The  increase  was  driven  by  an  increased  frequency  of  nasopharyngitis  and 
upper respiratory tract infection. 
• 
TEAEs  reported  more  frequently  in  the  teriflunomide  group  than  in  the  placebo  group  in 
paediatrics  with  a  difference  ≥  5%  vs.  a  more  evenly  distribution  in  adult  treatment  groups 
(except for alopecia): nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, alopecia, paresthesia, 
abdominal pain, and blood CPK increased. Based on the almost identical teriflunomide median 
exposure (in days) in paediatrics and adults, reporting of these TEAEs is higher in children as 
compared to adults. 
A lower reporting was noted in paediatrics vs. adults for hepatic disorders TEAEs and increases in ALT; 
hypothetical  reasons  for  this  observation  are  a  less  frequent  monitoring  of  liver  enzymes  in  Study

EFC11759 as compared to adult studies in the first 24 weeks (i.e. every 4 weeks vs. every 2 weeks), but 
could also be a consequence of half the adult equivalent 14 mg dose administered for the first 8 weeks 
of treatment (PK run-in phase) in all patients. 
No  relevant  differences  between  paediatrics  and  adults  were  observed  regarding  hypertension, 
haematological effects, interstitial lung disease (ILD), hypersensitivity reactions, peripheral neuropathy, 
teratogenicity,  serious  opportunistic  infections  (including  progressive  multifocal  leukoencephalopathy 
[PML]), malignancies, renal failure/ function parameters, and body weight changes.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No fatal cases were reported in any treatment arm during the DB or OL period up to the data cut-off.  
A  similar  proportion  of  patients  in  the  DB  period  had  at  least  1  treatment-emergent  SAE  (11.0%  of 
patients  on  teriflunomide  and  10.5%  of  patients  on  placebo).  Overall,  18  patients  reported  25  SAEs. 
There was no increased incidence of SAEs in patients < 13 years. 
The  most  frequent  treatment-emergent  SAEs  (≥  1.0%  of  patients  in  either  treatment  group)  were 
syncope  (1.8%  in  both  groups),  epilepsy  (0.9%  in  the  teriflunomide  group  and  1.8%  in  the  placebo 
group) and blood CPK increased (1.8% versus none, respectively). All other SAEs were reported by 1 
patient each.  The  majority  of  SAEs have not been  considered  related to IMP by  the investigator.  The 
SAEs  rated  to  be  related  to  teriflunomide  were  pulmonary  tuberculosis,  blood  CPK  increased,  ALT 
increased,  neutropenia,  and  pancreatitis  acute.  Cardiomyopathy  in  a  single  patient  after  3  weeks  on 
teriflunomide was related to pre-existing congenital cardiac abnormalities. The patient was hospitalized 
for a relapse. Teriflunomide was continued as planned. 
During  the  OL  period,  the  proportion  of  patients  with  treatment  emergent  SAEs  was  lower  in  the 
teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group than in the placebo/ teriflunomide group (13.0% and 28.8%). Overall, 
28 patients reported 41 SAEs during the OL period. The most frequently reported SAEs by PTs in ≥ 2.0% 
of  patients  in  either  treatment  group  were  Uhthoff’s  phenomenon,  asthma,  ALT  increased,  and  blood 
CPK increased (2% vs. 0, 0 vs. 3.8%, 0 vs. 3.8%, and 2.0 vs. 1.9% in the teriflunomide/teriflunomide 
group and placebo/ teriflunomide group, respectively). Other SAEs were reported by single patients only. 
The majority of SAEs have not been considered related to teriflunomide by the investigator. The SAEs 
rated to be related to treatment were pancreatitis (T/T), two SAEs of blood CPK increased (each from 
the T/T group), headache (P/T), two SAEs of ALT increased (each from the P/T group), acute sinusitis 
(P/T), neutropenia (T/T), upper respiratory tract infection (T/T), and MS (T/T).  
Moreover,  in  the  teriflunomide/  teriflunomide  group,  three  SAEs  in  2  patients  were  found  noteworthy 
given that these were not considered related to teriflunomide: 
The SAEs of central nervous system infection and pneumonia (and upper respiratory tract infection as 
of 12 September 2020) were reported in a patient, who was also reported with SAEs of epilepsy and 
upper respiratory tract infection during the DB period. This patient also had a relevant medical history 
(see AESI section on infections). The SAE of pancreatic neoplasm in a patient during the OL period is 
considered a medically significant event against the background of known pancreatic effects elicited by 
teriflunomide. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Mean  platelet  count  in  the  teriflunomide  group  dropped  approx.  10 %  from  baseline  up  to  Week 8 
compared to the placebo group during the DB period and remained stable up to Week 96. At EOT in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289596/2021

DB period, the mean platelets were 247.3 x 109/L in the teriflunomide group and 269.7 x 109/L in the 
placebo group. The decrease was similarly observed in the placebo/teriflunomide group at the beginning 
of the OL period and became similar between groups during the OL period. 
A  slight  decrease  in  leukocytes  from  baseline  to  Week 20,  mainly  neutrophils  and  lymphocytes  was 
observed in the teriflunomide group compared to the placebo group and remained stable thereafter. The 
decrease in leukocytes of approximately 15% (19% in neutrophils and 10% in lymphocytes) is in line 
with  the  adult  population.  However,  mean  decreases  were  delayed  up  to  Week 20  in  paediatrics  as 
compared to adults (up to Weeks 6), which could be explained by the switch from half to full the adult 
equivalent dose at Week 8 in a majority of paediatrics. This might have caused additional decreases up 
to Week 20. At EOT in the DB period, the mean leukocytes were 5.78 x 109/L in the teriflunomide group 
and  6.96  x  109/L  in  the  placebo  group  (neutrophils:  3.35  109/L  and  4.34  109/L,  respectively  and 
lymphocytes: 1.87 x109/L and 2.06 x 109/L, respectively).  
A decrease in leukocytes from baseline to week 20, mainly neutrophils and lymphocytes, was observed 
in  the  teriflunomide/  teriflunomide  group  compared  to  the  placebo/  teriflunomide  group  during  OL 
stabilising thereafter. 
No clinically relevant differences between groups were observed for changes over time of haemoglobin, 
haematocrit, erythrocytes mean corpuscular volume, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin 
time, monocytes, basophils, and eosinophils. 
The proportion of patients with PCSA during the DB period was slightly higher in the teriflunomide than 
in the placebo group for haemoglobin decrease from baseline ≥ 20 g/L and for platelets < 100 x 109/L. 
3.7% of subjects in the teriflunomide group vs. none on placebo reported platelets < 100 x 109/L (the 
lowest  platelets  value  was  92  x  109/L).  The  proportion  of  patients  with  low  PCSA  for  leukocytes  and 
lymphocytes was higher in the teriflunomide group as compared to placebo group (64.2% vs. 39.3%).  
There was no worsening of PCSA in any parameters in the OL period. 
Clinical chemistry 
Mean phosphorus levels decreased from Week 0 to Week 24 in the teriflunomide and placebo groups; 
however,  the  decrease  in  the  teriflunomide  group  was  approximately  10%  from  baseline  relative  to 
placebo, an effect already labelled in the SmPC. Mean creatine kinase values increased by~ 17% until 
EOT  with  teriflunomide,  although,  the  SD  was  very  high  at  all  visits.  The  plots  of  mean  change  from 
baseline in CPK over time in the DB and the OL period imply that there were outliers of mean changes 
from baseline at some time points only in the teriflunomide and in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group, 
respectively. The proportion of patients with high CPK abnormalities (≥ 3x ULN) was slightly higher in 
the teriflunomide group as compared to the placebo group (8.3% versus 3.6%) during the DB period. 
Some of the elevated CPK reported in the teriflunomide group could be explained by alternative etiology 
(strenuous exercise or trauma). 
For liver function parameters and pancreatic enzymes see AESIs. 
Renal function 
Mean uric acid levels decreased with teriflunomide but not with placebo within the first 24 weeks of 
treatment during the DB period and remained stable thereafter on a decreased level. A similar 
decrease was observed in the placebo/ teriflunomide group during the OL period within the first 
12 weeks of treatment.  
The proportion of patients with PCSA for uric acid (< 120 μmol/L for adults) was higher in the 
teriflunomide group than in the placebo group (11.9% and 3.6%, respectively).  
Assessment report

Page 73/109 
 
 
 
 
No relevant changes were observed for creatinine, creatinine clearance or blood urea nitrogen, neither 
during the DB or OL period. 
Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) 
Mean TSH values slightly decreased approximately over the first 48 weeks in the teriflunomide but not 
in the placebo group. Mean TSH values slightly decreased through first 48 weeks during DB period in the 
teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group and stabilised thereafter. 
Vital signs, physical findings and other observations related to safety 
Body  Weight:  A  slight  decrease  in  mean  BW  in  patients  on  teriflunomide  over  placebo  was  observed 
during the first 24 weeks of treatment (0.5 kg vs. 0.1 kg). From Week 24 to Week 96, BW increased in 
both groups. The proportion of patients with a BW decrease ≥ 5% was higher in the teriflunomide group 
compared  to  the  placebo  group  (40.4%  versus  26.8%).  Mean  change  in  BW  slightly  increased  from 
baseline  to  Week 84  then  returned  to  the  baseline  in  the  teriflunomide/  teriflunomide  group,  while  it 
remained stable in the placebo/ teriflunomide group.  
Electrocardiogram: No relevant changes were observed for electrocardiogram parameters, neither during 
the DB period nor with longer treatment in the OL period. 
Tanner stage: The majority (more than 90%) of patients in both arms was Tanner stage >I (pubertal) 
at  baseline.  During  the  DB  period,  and  similar  for  both  treatment  groups,  pubertal  development  in 
patients  not  yet  fully  pubertal  was  generally  of  no  more  than  2 stages,  which  is  in  line  with  the 
expectation of a progress rate in sexual maturation of approx. one Tanner stage per year retrieved from 
scientific literature17. This is, however, based on a rather small number of paediatric patients with less 
than Tanner Stage IV or V at baseline, who – at the same time – completed the 96-week DB period in 
study EFC11759. Moreover, variability in progression of Tanner Stages between treatment groups was 
observed  during  the  combined  DB  and  OL  periods  in  either  gender,  which  cannot  be  further  clarified 
given the limited number of patients included in this additional analysis. In the OL period, patients in 
both treatment groups progressed to higher Tanner stages without relevant differences. 
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic and extrinsic factors were analysed for their effects on the incidence of any TEAEs, SAEs, TEAEs 
leading to treatment discontinuation, and AESIs. Few differences overall in both treatment groups were 
observed, in particular for infections and hepatic disorders regarding age, race, and BW. Regarding race, 
there was a trend for a higher exposure in Asians compared to Caucasians (for patients receiving 14 mg 
adult equivalent, median AUC0-24SS = 1872 μg.h/mL for Asians and 1284 μg.h/mL for Caucasians). 12 
and 25 patients on placebo and teriflunomide, respectively, were of Asian origin and all of them reported 
any TEAEs. With regard to Pubertal status (Tanner stage ≤I vs. >I), all pre-pubertal subjects reported 
at least one TEAE, while there were no obvious differences in reporting of SAEs and TEAEs leading to 
discontinuation of treatment.  
In  general,  no  specific  increase  was  noted  in  the  teriflunomide  group  or  teriflunomide/  teriflunomide 
group as compared to the placebo group or placebo/ teriflunomide group. Teriflunomide safety profile 
was generally consistent across subgroups. There were no new or unexpected safety findings.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No specific drug interaction studies were performed with teriflunomide in paediatric patients. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Six  (5.5%)  patients  in  the  teriflunomide  group  and  no  patient  in  the  placebo  group  reported  a  TEAE 
leading to treatment discontinuation in the DB period: pancreatitis acute was reported in 2 patients and 
the  other  PTs  were  reported  by  1  patient  each  and  included  pulmonary  tuberculosis,  hyperlipasemia, 
affective disorder and ALT increased. 
Three (3.0%) of patients in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group and six (11.5%) of patients in the 
placebo/ teriflunomide group had to discontinue teriflunomide due to a TEAE in the OL period. In the 
placebo/ teriflunomide group, one patient reported neuropathy peripheral and five patients reported ALT 
increased.  The  reasons  for  discontinuation  in  the  teriflunomide/  teriflunomide  group  were  serious 
“pancreatitis”,  serious  “pancreatitis  acute”,  and  “amylase  increased  and  lipase  increased”  in  a  single 
patient (in the context of serious pancreatitis diagnosis).  
AEs leading to discontinuation from treatment followed the known safety profile of teriflunomide as did 
TEAEs  and  SAEs  leading  to  temporary  treatment  interruption  in  patients.  Treatment  interruption 
concerned solely but only few patients on teriflunomide, were often due to laboratory abnormalities and 
were limited to a few days in the majority of subjects (except for a 44 day interruption of teriflunomide 
in a patient with neutropenia). 
Post marketing experience 
A search from international birth date of 12 September 2012 through 17 January 2020 was performed 
in  the  Sanofi  Global  Pharmacovigilance  Database  in  order  to  identify  off-label  post-marketing  data  in 
paediatrics  (up  to  17 years  of  age)  from  international  birth  date  of  Aubagio  to  data  cut-off  (January 
2020). Cases for which AEs have been reported (36 out of 39 cases) were in a majority related to the 
underlying disease. Nonserious AEs in 4 patients were in line with the safety profile of teriflunomide. Two 
SAEs involved acute myocarditis following a viral infection and diarrhoea with traces of blood. While in 
the case of myocarditis, a causal relation seems to be present for the viral infection, the SAE of diarrhoea 
with traces of blood was not assessable due to a lack of background information. There were no case 
reports for children below the age of 11 years. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of teriflunomide in paediatrics has been characterized based on the results of study 
EFC11759: a single, multicenter, randomized, DB, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study in children 
and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age with RMS. Controlled safety data up to 96 weeks derives from the 
completed DB period of the trial, and followed by an ongoing OL period (up to 192 weeks). For the latter, 
interim results with the data cut-off 12 September 2020 are available to provide preliminary long-term 
safety experience. In the paediatric population special attention should be given to possible AE on sexual 
maturation, cognition, endocrine function and other aspects of development. This is of importance given 
that susceptibility to specific adverse reactions might also change from pre- to post-pubertal children. 
Tanner staging was assessed for each location (pubic hair and breasts in girls, pubic hair and testes in 
boys) by gender and treatment group, every 24 weeks, and at EOT or until complete sexual maturity 
(Tanner Stage V). The progress in sexual maturation in normal adolescents is expected to be 1 Tanner 
stage per year, which was likewise observed in paediatrics of both treatment groups in study EFC11759. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289596/2021  
Page 75/109 
 
 
 
 
However, the small number of patients with Tanner Stages < IV and V at baseline and a full course of 
96-week DB treatment needs to be considered when interpreting the data on sexual maturation. 
Study EFC11759 
A total of 166 patients were randomized, 109 patients in the teriflunomide group and 57 patients in the 
placebo group, which represents an acceptable number for a paediatric MS trial.  
The recommended teriflunomide dose in paediatrics ≥40 kg should be 14 mg and in paediatrics <40 kg 
it should be 7 mg, aiming at the same exposure as in adults. At the end of the PK run-in period, 11 of 
109 patients received 7 mg teriflunomide and 97 of 109 patients (89%) received 14 mg teriflunomide. 
In the OL period, 126 of 152 patients (83%) received the 14 mg dose. No patient in study EFC11759 
(neither during DB nor OL) was initiated on the 14 mg adult equivalent teriflunomide dose proposed in 
the SmPC. Even though, the 14 mg dose does not raise particular safety concerns beyond those in adults, 
tolerability issues, e.g. nausea, diarrhoea, and alopecia might be expected following treatment initiation 
with  doses  based  on  the  adult  exposure.  Consequently,  compliance  problems  or  early  treatment 
discontinuations might occur. No clinically relevant differences could be observed upon analysis of TEAEs 
in  the  DB  period  for  the  two  time  intervals  of  interest  (i.e.,  for  the  first  8 weeks  of  treatment,  when 
patients received half the adult equivalent dose, and the second 8 weeks, when patients received the 
full adult equivalent dose). In general, TEAEs were more frequently reported within the first 8 weeks of 
treatment. Nevertheless, it cannot be fully excluded that some of the tolerability TEAEs of interest (e.g. 
GI  disorders  TEAEs)  might  have  been  mitigated  upon  “titration”  of  teriflunomide  from  half  to  full  the 
adult equivalent dose within 16 weeks of treatment. In addition, the numbers of subjects with TEAEs in 
this analysis are small hampering the evaluation of clear trends. 
Extent of exposure was 131 PYE in the 14 mg dose group vs. 57 PYE in the placebo group during DB 
treatment.  Moreover,  median  duration  of  treatment  during  the  DB  period  was  shorter  for  placebo  as 
compared to teriflunomide (273.0 days vs. 660.0 days). The imbalance is acknowledged to be driven by 
the higher frequency  of  switches due  to clinical relapses or  high  MRI activity  in  the placebo group as 
compared to the teriflunomide group. Exposure differences need to be considered for interpretation of 
the safety data, especially regarding TEAEs that consistently occurred throughout the study. 
Cumulatively, 100 (92%) and 73 (67%) of teriflunomide-treated paediatric patients were exposed to the 
drug  for  ≥  6 months  and  ≥  1 year,  respectively.  Controlled  safety  data  for  more  than  2 years  of 
teriflunomide treatment are limited to 41 patients (38%) (and 10 [17.5 %] of placebo-treated patients). 
Interim data from the OL experience added a cumulative exposure of 263.71 PYE. Up to the new data 
cut-off, the highest cumulative duration of OL treatment with teriflunomide 14 mg was ~3.5 years for 
7 patients.  
Exposure data based on age was provided upon request. The median duration of treatment was similar 
in both age categories for patients on placebo (299.5 days and 273.0 days) and slightly higher in patients 
<  13 years  versus  those  ≥  13 years  treated  with  teriflunomide  (669 days  vs.  596 days).  A  similar 
percentage  of  patients  in  both  age  categories  per  treatment  group  had  a  cumulative  duration  of 
treatment more than six months and more than one year. Thus, exposures in the two age categories in 
placebo- and teriflunomide-treated paediatric patients were similar.  
The paediatric population  included in  the DB  period was similar to that in  other DMT MS  studies (i.e. 
Gilenya  EMEA/H/C/002202/X/0044/G).  Few  data  are  available  regarding  the  most  vulnerable 
subpopulations (< 13 years, Tanner stage I, BW ≤ 40 kg) for which the interpretability of safety data is 
difficult: 
•  Age: median age was 15 years. Only 16 patients on teriflunomide and 10 patients on placebo (i.e. 
26 out of 166 patients) were <13 years. The vast majority of patients in the ≥13 years age group 
was aged 16 to 17 years, thus, more in line with the adult population.

• 
Physical development: only 10 patients were pre-pubertal (6 %; 5 patients per group) reflected by 
Tanner Stage I. 
•  Body Weight: only 5 patients on teriflunomide (and 6 patients on placebo) in the DB period had a 
BW of ≤40 kg. These patients were treated with a dose of 7 mg. 
TEAEs, SAEs, and TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation  
No deaths were reported as per the data cut-off. The number of patients with any TEAEs during the DB 
period  was  slightly  higher  in  the  teriflunomide  group  as  compared  to  placebo  (88.1%  vs.  82.5%).  A 
similar proportion of patients reported SAEs (11% vs. 10.5%), while TEAE-related discontinuations of 
treatment were only reported in the teriflunomide arm (5.5% of patients). During the OL period, more 
patients from the placebo/ teriflunomide group reported TEAEs, SAEs, and TEAEs leading to permanent 
treatment discontinuation as compared to those from the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group. Thus, data 
imply that a majority of events occur early during treatment with teriflunomide.  
The most frequently reported TEAEs during the DB period (>20 % in either group) in paediatrics were 
similar to adults and  derived from  the Infections  and  infestations  SOC,  Skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders SOC, Nervous system disorders SOC, Gastrointestinal disorders SOC, and Investigations SOC. 
Differences  mainly  pertain  to  a  disproportional  reporting  (≥  5%  with  teriflunomide  vs.  placebo)  of 
nasopharyngitis (25.7% vs. 8.8%), upper respiratory tract infection (21.1% vs. 10.5%), alopecia (21.1% 
vs. 12.3%), paresthesia (11.0% vs. 1.8%), abdominal pain (11.0% vs. 1.8%), and blood CPK increased 
(5.5% vs. 0%). For other SOCs, where an increased reporting was noted in patients on teriflunomide, 
PTs do not indicate a specific cluster. 
During the OL period, the overall reporting of TEAEs by SOC was comparable to DB treatment and either 
similar or higher in the placebo/ teriflunomide group compared to the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group.  
25 serious AEs occurred in 18 patients during the DB period. 2 of the 18 patients (one in each group) 
were < 13 years. No pre-pubertal patient (Tanner stage I) experienced a SAE in the teriflunomide group. 
The  most  frequently  reported  SAEs  were  syncope  (2  patients  [1.8%]  on  teriflunomide  vs.  1  patient 
[1.8%] on placebo), epilepsy (one patient in each group) and blood creatine phosphokinase increased 
(2  patients  [1.8%]  versus  none,  respectively).  SAEs  rated  as  being  related  to  teriflunomide  were 
pulmonary  tuberculosis,  neutropenia  (re-challenge),  pancreatitis  acute,  blood  CPK  increased,  ALT 
increased.  
SAEs during the OL period were basically in line with those from the DB period and were reported by a 
higher percentage of patients in the placebo/ teriflunomide group (28.8% vs. 13.0% in the teriflunomide/ 
teriflunomide group). Overall, 28 patients reported 41 SAEs during the OL period. 5 out of 28 patients 
with  SAEs  were  <  13  years  old.  The  most  frequent  treatment-emergent  SAEs  were  Uhthoff’s 
phenomenon, asthma, ALT increased, and blood CPK increased (2% and 0%, , 0% and 3.8%, 0% and 
3.8%,  and  2.0  and  1.9%  in  the  teriflunomide/  teriflunomide  group  and  in  the  placebo/  teriflunomide 
group, respectively). SAEs that were rated related to teriflunomide were pancreatitis, two SAEs of blood 
CPK  increased,  headache,  two  SAEs  of  ALT  increased,  acute  sinusitis,  neutropenia,  upper  respiratory 
tract infection, and MS.  
In the DB period, TEAEs leading to permanent treatment discontinuation were solely reported by patients 
in  the  teriflunomide  group  (5.5%)  in  line  with  the  expected  safety  profile  (i.e.  infections  [pulmonary 
tuberculosis],  pancreatic  effects  [hyperlipasemia  and  pancreatitis  acute],  and  hepatic  effects  [ALT 
increased]. In the OL period, discontinuations due to TEAEs were similar to the DB period and driven by 
patients  in  the  placebo/  teriflunomide  group.  TEAEs  occurred  in  single  patients  only  except  for  ALT 
increased (5 patients in the placebo/ teriflunomide group [10 %]).

Temporary discontinuations from treatment due to TEAEs or SAEs occurred in few patients only and were 
limited to a few days in most of the patients. 
Adverse events of special interest 
The incidence of gastrointestinal disorders (specifically nausea and diarrhoea) in paediatrics appears not 
different  from  adults.  However,  given  that  both  events  occur  dose-related  (based  on  the  adult 
experience) and early during treatment (mainly within the first weeks to three months), the full adult 
equivalent dose (on which paediatrics have not been initiated in EFC11759) might cause tolerability and 
compliance issues in paediatrics, which cannot be clarified with the available data. 
Hepatic toxicity is an important identified risk related to teriflunomide and mainly presents with elevation 
of  ALT  most frequently  within  the  first  6 months  of  treatment.  RMMs  are  in  place  and  detailed  in  the 
adult SmPC in sections 4.3 (patients with Child-Pugh class C), 4.4 (baseline and routine monitoring of 
liver enzymes), and 4.8, which likewise apply to paediatrics. During the DB period, increases in mean 
ALT started at Week 4 and increased during the first 6 months. 26% patients on teriflunomide and 14% 
of  patients  on  placebo  had  ALT  >  1x  ULN.  ALT  increases  >  1x  ULN  were  solely  observed  in  the 
teriflunomide group (7 patients had ALT > 2x ULN, 6 %) but not in the placebo group; two of them had 
ALT > 5x ULN and 1 of them had ALT > 10x ULN. The incidence of hepatic disorders TEAEs from the 
hepatobiliary  disorders  SOC  and  the  investigations  SOC  (mainly  ALT  increased)  was  similar  in  the 
teriflunomide and placebo group (4.6% and 3.5% [sum of TEAEs in both SOCs]). Two patients in the 
teriflunomide group experienced serious hepatic disorders: ALT increased and increased transaminases, 
respectively.  Both  events  were  asymptomatic  and  accompanied  by  CPK  increased.  Both  patients 
recovered without corrective treatment and with continuation of teriflunomide. During the OL period, an 
initial increase in mean ALT was observed in the placebo/ teriflunomide group over the first weeks of 
treatment but also in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group. The reporting of hepatic AEs in the placebo/ 
teriflunomide group was higher as compared to the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group (15.4% vs. 3%) 
and even higher as reported in the teriflunomide group during the DB period (i.e. 4.6%), which could 
have been a consequence of concomitant (corticoid) medication in this treatment group (deriving from 
a switch from placebo to teriflunomide due to MS relapse). No increased incidence of hepatic SAEs was 
reported during the OL period. However, one patient (376003004) was diagnosed with “drug-induced 
liver injury”. Upon request, the Applicant provided explanation on a possible confounder (i.e. minocycline 
treatment prior to the event). While it remains undetermined whether this case indeed presents DILI, 
this  issue  has  been  discussed  in  the  two  recent  variation  procedures  EMEA/H/C/002514/II/0029  and 
EMEA/H/C/002514/II/0032.  As  an  outcome  of  these  variations,  the  frequency  of  hepatic  enzyme 
monitoring  has  been  revised  and  warning  statements  have  been  included  in  the  SmPC.  The  recently 
approved  liver  enzyme  monitoring  schedule  in  adults,  i.e.  at  least  every  four  weeks  during  the  first 
6 months, and regularly thereafter, is likewise applicable to paediatrics given that the hepatic safety is 
considered similar in paediatrics and adults.  
Slight  differences  in  hepatic  safety  might  be  attributed  to  the  different  schedule  of  liver  enzyme 
monitoring, i.e. every 4 weeks in paediatrics vs. every 2 weeks in adults. Moreover, the contribution of 
lower  initial  teriflunomide  doses  during  the  first  8 weeks  of  treatment  in  the  paediatric  trial  to  the 
incidence of liver enzyme increases, which are known to occur early during treatment, is unknown.  
There were no cases of hepatitis or Hy’s law in paediatric patients.  
Pancreatic  effects  are  an  important  identified  risk  with  teriflunomide  treatment  that  derives  from  the 
nonclinical experience, clinical adult studies, and most of all from post-marketing reports.  
Mean  amylase  and  lipase  values  (markers  of  pancreas  function)  did  not  show  noticeable  differences 
between treatment groups during the DB and OL period.

An increased reporting of TEAEs in line with pancreatic disorders was observed during the DB period, i.e. 
4  patients  (3.7%)  in  the  teriflunomide  group  and  1  patient  (1.8%)  in  the  placebo  group,  all  of  them 
rated  as  related  to  teriflunomide.  Three  of  four  events  led  to  treatment  discontinuation  in  the 
teriflunomide  group:  one  serious  case  of  acute  pancreatitis,  one  nonserious  but  severe  case  of  acute 
caudal  pancreatitis  (both  requiring  hospitalisation),  and  one  nonserious  and  asymptomatic  case  of 
hyperlipasemia. The incidence of pancreatic disorders TEAEs in paediatrics during the DB period contrasts 
the controlled pooled clinical data in adults, for which the incidence was similar in both groups (2.7% on 
teriflunomide  and  2.8%  on  placebo).  Moreover,  TEAEs  of  pancreatitis  were  not  reported  in  the 
teriflunomide groups in clinical studies in adults. During the OL period, pancreatic disorders TEAEs were 
reported in 6 patients, 5 patients (5.0%) in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group and 1 patient (1.9%) 
in  the  placebo/  teriflunomide  group.  The  latter  was  a  nonserious  event  of  an  asymptomatic  lipase 
increased ≥ 2x ULN. Two patients experienced SAEs of pancreatitis and pancreatitis acute, leading to 
treatment  discontinuation.  The  SAEs  occurred  after  1  and  3 years  of  teriflunomide  treatment, 
respectively. Both SAEs presented with symptoms of pancreatitis and were accompanied by pancreatic 
enzyme  elevations,  led  to  hospitalisation  and  were  treated  with  corrective  treatments.  The  SAE  of 
pancreatitis acute  was severe in intensity and specifically concerning given that the patient presented 
with  medically  significant  “pancreatic  neoplasm”  according  to  the  narrative,  and  accompanied  by 
symptoms (persistent epigastric pain, nausea, abdominal and back pain), and elevations in pancreatic 
enzymes and for which a surgery was indicated but refused. This case lacks biopsy results to confirm 
whether  this  is  indeed  a  benign  inflammatory  process  or  a  malignancy.  Laboratory  data  and  adverse 
events for this patient during the DB period have been provided and were unremarkable. The investigator 
did  not  consider  teriflunomide  to  be  related  to  the  pseudo-papilloma  of  the  uncinate  process  of  the 
pancreas, which in consequence led to the event of pancreatitis. However, a contribution of teriflunomide 
remains likely. One additional patient upon the OL data cut-off of 12 September 2020 was reported with 
nonserious pancreatitis of mild intensity accompanied by elevations in pancreatic enzymes after more 
than 2.5 years of teriflunomide treatment, and confirmed by ultrasound. This event also led to treatment 
discontinuation and accelerated elimination procedure. 
The risk  for  pancreatitis  in  paediatrics and adults  was further taken  up by  the  Applicant  in  a detailed 
review  of  cases  from  different  sources,  informed  by  postmarketing  data,  literature  review  and 
disproportionality analyses using external databases. Results of this review contribute to the results from 
study  EFC11759.  The  incidence  of  pancreatitis  in  teriflunomide-treated  adults  was  found  higher 
compared to adult background rates (74.9/100,000 vs. 45/100,000); moreover, in teriflunomide-treated 
paediatrics the incidence of pancreatitis was found much higher compared to background paediatric rates 
(4/166  [3%]  vs.  1/10.000).  Specific  events  reported  in  adults,  e.g.  pancreatic  pseudocyst  and 
pancreatitis  necrotising,  are  of  general  concern  and  should  be  taken  into  account  when  treating 
paediatrics.  
Upon request, the Applicant proposed to include more detailed information regarding onset of pancreatic 
TEAEs,  symptoms,  diagnostic  measures,  and  pancreatic  enzyme  monitoring  in  SmPC  section  4.4. 
Discussion on feasibility and benefit of baseline and routine pancreatic enzyme monitoring, however, led 
to the conclusion that this would not reduce the risk of pancreatitis, even in patients receiving drugs with 
an  established  risk  of  pancreatitis.  Therefore,  the  risk  seems  to  be  sufficiently  covered  by  obtaining 
pancreatic enzymes in case of suspected pancreatitis and discontinuation of teriflunomide if pancreatitis 
is confirmed. In section 4.8, the Applicant included further refinement on the source data in the paediatric 
study. Furthermore, a paragraph on “Gastrointestinal disorders” in the section “Description of selected 
adverse  reactions”  has  been  added  to  include  general  information  on  pancreatitis  in  adults  in  the 
postmarketing setting. Overall, it remains important to increase awareness for such events in HCPs and 
patients to early identify those with a high risk for pancreatitis. Post-marketing follow-up of pancreatitis 
by means of targeted follow-up forms to the reporter of these events is considered to further address 
this issue in the real world setting.

Haematological effects are a designated identified risk with teriflunomide that causes anti-proliferative 
action  on  rapidly  dividing  cells  leading  to  decreased  erythropoiesis  and  granulopoiesis  in  the  bone 
marrow.  As  indicated  in  the  Aubagio  EPAR,  haematopoietic  changes  in  bone  marrow  might  result  in 
development  of  anaemia,  leukopenia,  lymphocytopenia  and  thrombocytopenia,  which  can  lead  to 
impaired coagulation, haemorrhages, hemosiderosis and bacterial infections. 
The  proportion  of  patients  with  bone  marrow  disorders  was  higher  with  teriflunomide  treatment 
compared to placebo in the DB period (7.3% vs. 1.8%) but not higher than in adults. The most frequently 
reported TEAEs derived from the blood and lymphatic system disorders SOC (neutropenia, leukopenia, 
and  monocytopenia)  and  from  the  investigations  SOC  (WBC  count  decreased,  and  neutrophil  count 
decreased were reported in 3.7% and 2.8% of patients on teriflunomide). One related SAE of neutropenia 
was confounded by a history of cyclic neutropenia (this was also the only patient with a SAE in the OL 
period). No increased incidence of events was observed during OL treatment.  
Changes  in  haematology  parameters  were  similar  to  adults:  platelet  counts  decreased  approx.  10  % 
from  baseline  to  Week  8  with  teriflunomide  and  remained  stable  thereafter.  4  subjects  in  the 
teriflunomide group vs. none on placebo had PCSA of low platelet counts (i.e. < 100 x 109/L), which 
was  either  not  confirmed  upon  repeat  testing  or  falsely  entered  as  PCSA  despite  being  in  the  normal 
range. Platelet count reductions did not lead to an increase in haemorrhagic TEAEs during the DB period. 
Although, contusion was reported more frequently in the teriflunomide group as compared to placebo 
(3.7%  vs.0%),  events  were  related  to  sporting  injury  or  accidental  fall.  One  patient  reported  a 
gastrointestinal  haemorrhage,  which  followed  several  occasions  of  haematological  abnormalities, 
including reduced platelet counts. A  contribution  of  teriflunomide to the  gastrointestinal  haemorrhage 
cannot be excluded. 
A  decrease  of  15  %  from  baseline  to  Week  20  in  leukocytes  (mainly  neutrophils  and  lymphocytes), 
similar  to  adults,  was  observed  in  the  teriflunomide  group.  No  clinically  relevant  differences  between 
groups were observed for changes over time for other haematological parameters. RMM regarding the 
known identified haematological effects with teriflunomide in adults include regular monitoring of blood 
cell counts during treatment and a contraindication in patients with pre-existing impaired bone marrow 
function/ significant leukopenia are likewise adequate for the paediatric population.  
Infections are an identified risk with teriflunomide, while serious opportunistic infections, including PML, 
are a potential risk. The Aubagio PI already includes a number of RMM to account for the risk of infections 
subsequent to  immunomodulation/ immunosuppression  from  long-term treatment (in  section  4.3 and 
4.4).  In adults,  most of  the reported infection and  infestation TEAEs  from  clinical trials occurred with 
“common”  frequency,  except  for  severe  infections  including  sepsis  (section  4.8:  not  known,  deriving 
from post-marketing experience). The incidence of infection SAEs with teriflunomide in adults was low 
and not different to placebo in clinical trials (~2.7%), with serious opportunistic infections reported with 
an incidence of 0.2%.  
TEAEs  from  the  infections  and  infestations  SOC  were  reported  more  frequently  on  teriflunomide  as 
compared to placebo (66.1% vs. 45.6%). The imbalance between teriflunomide and placebo is mainly 
driven  by  unspecific,  seasonal  and  non-serious  infections  of  the  upper  respiratory  tract  and 
nasopharyngitis. These events might also explain the slightly higher incidence in paediatrics as compared 
to adults. The incidence of infection SAEs was low and identical in both groups (1.8%): two SAEs occurred 
in  the  teriflunomide  group,  one  of  which  was  an  opportunistic  infection  (pulmonary  tuberculosis).  No 
increased occurrence of infections or a difference in PTs was reported during the OL period. Opportunistic 
infections were similarly reported in the placebo and teriflunomide group and reporting in the OL period 
did not exceed that in the DB period. Except for pulmonary tuberculosis during the DB period, and CNS 
infection during OL teriflunomide, which both were rated serious, all other opportunistic infections were 
nonserious and mostly single TEAEs of herpes virus, herpes zoster, mycoplasma, and varicella.

Malignancies (incl. lymphoproliferative disorders) are a potential risk of teriflunomide. No malignancies 
were  reported  up  to  the  data  cut-off  in  paediatrics  except  for  the  report  of  a  case  of  “pancreatic 
neoplasm” for which biopsy results are lacking in order to rule out a malignant condition. 
Hypertension  is  an  important  identified  risk  with  teriflunomide  covered  by  appropriate  routine  RMMs: 
blood pressure is recommended to be measured prior to teriflunomide initiation and periodically during 
treatment. Any hypertensive condition needs to be managed before and during treatment. No new safety 
signals with respect to blood pressure changes emerged in paediatrics.  
The designated AESI of pulmonary disorders derives from the identified risk of ILD that has been reported 
with the parent compound leflunomide and with teriflunomide in the postmarketing setting in adults but 
not in study EFC11759 until the data cut-off. More patients on teriflunomide reported TEAEs related to 
pulmonary disorders as compared to placebo (63.3% vs. 43.9%), the difference being caused by the 
imbalance  in  TEAEs  from  the  infections  and  infestations  SOC.  The  incidence  of  TEAEs  coded  under 
respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  SOC  was  similar  in  both  groups  during  the  DB  period. 
Notably, unspecific oropharyngeal pain and dyspnoea were reported with low incidence but more often 
in the teriflunomide group. Two SAEs in the teriflunomide group included upper respiratory tract infection 
and pulmonary tuberculosis (related to a school epidemic). The reporting of TEAEs related to pulmonary 
disorders was similar for both groups in the OL period and lower than in the DB period. Five patients 
experienced rather unspecific SAEs, including lung infection and upper respiratory tract infection, acute 
sinusitis, bronchitis and tonsillitis. Asthma was reported as SAE in 2 patients with a medical history that 
could  have  contributed  to  the  events.  Cautious  wording  is  included  in  the  product  information  and 
considered adequate. 
A  single  paediatric  patient  experienced  a  non-serious,  mild  and  transient  “weakened  left  side”  with 
teriflunomide (captured under “Embolic and thrombotic disorders”), which was coded as hemiparesis and 
rated as related to the underlying MS. 
During  the  DB  period,  nonserious  TEAEs  in  line  with  peripheral  neuropathy  were  reported  in  a  single 
patient per group. During the OL period, 3 patients (3.0%) in the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group and 
2 patients (3.8%) in the placebo/teriflunomide group experienced peripheral neuropathy. One patient in 
the  placebo/teriflunomide  group  reported  peripheral  neuropathy  of  moderate  intensity  that  was 
confirmed by electromyogram and led to discontinuation of teriflunomide. The patient recovered within 
approximately one year.  
Teriflunomide  is  not  considered  to  evoke  convulsions,  for  which  a  signal  has  been  raised  during 
EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010135/201709  (finally  not  confirmed).  The  incidence  of  epilepsy  was  low  and 
similar  in  both  groups  during  the  DB  phase.  The  only  SAE  in  the  teriflunomide  group  was  rated  not 
related (patient had a medical history of epilepsy). No events were reported during the OL period. 
Despite  its  non-life-threatening  nature,  alopecia  is  considered  an  important  TEAE  with  regard  to 
tolerability  and  compliance,  as  it  can  be  socially  debilitating,  particularly  for  female  subjects  and 
paediatrics and might thus impair compliance. However, from the DB period safety data, no compliance 
issues  could  be  deduced  from  the  small  number  of  paediatrics,  and  no  early  discontinuations  due  to 
alopecia were reported.  Although undetermined in the paediatric study, it remains unlikely (based on 
the PK characteristics of teriflunomide) that the full adult equivalent dose poses an additional risk over 
half the adult dose studied in the first 8 weeks of teriflunomide treatment. Alopecia is included as ADR 
in section 4.8 of the SmPC with the frequency “very common”. Slightly more paediatrics reported alopecia 
with teriflunomide as compared to adults (i.e. 22% vs. 14%). The same difference applied to paediatrics 
and  adults  treated  with  placebo  (12%  vs.  5.1%),  however,  mean  exposure  (in  days)  to  placebo  was 
much lower in paediatrics. During the OL period, more patients from the placebo/ teriflunomide group 
reported alopecia TEAEs as compared to the teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group (17.3% vs. 10%), which 
is indicative of a rather early and temporary effect.

Although,  there  is  no  evidence  for  an  increased  risk  for  psychiatric  disorders  with  teriflunomide  (or 
leflunomide)  in  adults,  there  is  scientific  evidence  that  psychiatric  disorders  more  frequently  occur  in 
paediatrics with demyelinating diseases. The proportion of patients with treatment-emergent psychiatric 
disorder was not different between teriflunomide and placebo during the DB period. During the OL period, 
depression  was  reported  in  7.7%  of  patients  in  the  placebo/  teriflunomide  group  vs.  1%  in  the 
teriflunomide/ teriflunomide group). The frequency is higher than in the treatment groups during the DB 
period but is based on a small number of patients with such events. A single SAE of emotional disorder 
of  childhood  (adolescent  mood  disorder)  together  with  self-harming  tendencies  was  reported  after  8 
months of treatment with teriflunomide during the OL period, which was not recovered at the time of 
data cut-off. 
Teriflunomide  can  cause  serious  birth  defects  when  administered  during  pregnancy  and  is  thus 
contraindicated  during  pregnancy  (SmPC  section  4.3).  However,  a  total  of  3  patients  treated  with 
teriflunomide became pregnant during the study. Two of them underwent elective abortion and the third 
gave  birth  to  a  normal  infant,  without  structural  defect  or  functional  abnormalities.  Undesired 
pregnancies are of special importance in female adolescents  and have been taken into account by an 
update of the educational material on teriflunomide. Adolescent pregnancies will also be monitored via 
the pregnancy registry. 
None of the other safety parameters evaluated, incl. laboratory parameters (not previously mentioned), 
vital signs and physical development, gave rise to specific concern and were similarly reported in adults. 
No  long-term  implications  on  BW  in  paediatrics  are  expected  based  on  the  provided  data.  A  small 
decrease over the first 24 weeks of treatment was not observed with longer teriflunomide duration. 
No clinically relevant changes over time were observed for ECG parameters during the study. 
Special populations have been studied, including intrinsic factors, i.e. age, gender, race, pubertal status, 
BW, and disease-related subgroups. Overall, there seems to be no specific subgroup for which the safety 
profile of teriflunomide is continuously worse than for the others taking into account the limitations that 
derive from very small numbers of patients included in subgroups (see above). The SOC depicting the 
highest variability in frequency of events in different subgroups is infections and infestations (generally 
the younger, pre-pubertal paediatrics and those with lower BW are more affected by PTs from this SOC). 
Few postmarketing data (~7 years) comprise off-label use data in paediatrics. Cases for which AEs were 
reported were in a majority related to the underlying disease. Two SAEs were reported, one involved 
acute myocarditis following a viral infection (which is plausibly related to teriflunomide) and one SAE of 
diarrhoea with traces of blood (not assessable). 
Comparison of the safety of teriflunomide in adults and paediatrics based on controlled study 
data 
The difference in exposure to placebo in pooled adult studies (nearly identical exposure to teriflunomide 
and  placebo  in  Pool  A1)  and  in  EFC11759  (exposure  to  placebo  was  less  than  half  of  teriflunomide 
exposure) needs to be taken into account for comparison of risks in paediatrics and adults. Reporting of 
recurrent events (e.g. seasonal respiratory infections) in EFC11759 probably inflates the incidence in the 
teriflunomide group in contrast to placebo. Nevertheless, the comparison between paediatrics and adults 
is based on a similar exposure to teriflunomide in controlled studies. 
Reporting  of  alopecia,  abdominal  pain,  paresthesia,  and  increased  CPK  was  higher  in  paediatrics 
compared to adults. While no reason could be identified for abdominal pain and paresthesia, an increased 
awareness of hair loss in paediatrics as compared to adults might be the reason for increased reporting 
of alopecia. A more frequent reporting of increased CPK might be a consequence of exercising and trauma 
in  a  majority  of  paediatrics  with  these  events.  However,  the  contribution  of  teriflunomide  remains 
uncertain and information on these differences has been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

No relevant differences between paediatrics and adults are anticipated for hypertension, haematological 
effects,  ILD,  hypersensitivity  reactions,  peripheral  neuropathy,  teratogenicity,  serious  opportunistic 
infections (including PML), malignancies, renal failure, and BW changes. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In support of the extension of the indication of Aubagio to paediatrics aged 10 to 17 years, the Applicant 
has provided controlled safety data up to 96 weeks deriving from a Phase 3 study (EFC11759), including 
an  ongoing  long-term  safety  follow-up  for  up  to  an  additional  96 weeks  with  a  data  cut-off  of  12 
September 2020. 
Controlled as well as OL teriflunomide safety data confirm the safety profile in paediatrics to be largely 
in line with the AESI identified in the adult MS population. However, long-term safety in children remains 
an  important  missing  information  which  warrants  further  characterisation  given  that  extrapolation  of 
safety from adult to paediatric patients is not straight forward. So far, only 41 (38%) of teriflunomide-
treated  paediatric  patients  received  the  drug  for  more  than  two  years.  Availability  of  controlled  long-
term  safety  data  is  therefore  limited.  Up  to  the  data  cut-off  12  September  2020,  152  patients  were 
enrolled  in  the  OL  period  of  the  study.  It  is  expected  that  the  long-term  safety  profile  is  further 
characterised by additional data collected in the OL period of study EFC11759. 
Based on the so far available data it appears that the risk of pancreatic toxicity is increased in paediatric 
patients  relative  to  adults.  Detailed  information  on  symptoms  and  actions  upon  suspicion  and 
confirmation of pancreatitis has been described in the product information to increase clinical awareness 
for this event.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
With the present application, the Applicant seeks approval of teriflunomide for paediatric patients from 
10 years to 17 years of age with RRMS. 
Paediatric  MS  is  a  severe  chronic,  immune-mediated  neurodegenerative  disorder  of  the  CNS, 
characterized by inflammation, demyelination, and axonal/neuronal destruction, with marked impact on 
patients’  life  and  development,  and  leading  to  disability  early  in  life.  Although  MS  is  predominantly  a 
disease  of  young  adults,  approximately  3%  to  5%  of  people  with  MS  have  their  first  symptoms  in 
childhood.  Genetic,  serum,  CSF,  and  cell-based  studies  largely  support  a  shared  biology  between 
paediatric-onset and adult-onset disease. Relapses are more frequent in patients with paediatric-onset 
compared with adult-onset MS and a greater number of MRI lesions is observed. A third of the paediatric 
MS patients experience cognitive impairment and MRI evidence of global and focal loss of age expected 
brain volume has been described. 
As  for  adult  MS  patients,  treatment  strategies  in  paediatric  MS  aim  at  the  symptomatic  treatment  of 
acute relapses and MS symptoms as well as on disease-modification. 
Due to the clinical phenotype of paediatric MS with relapses as the most important clinical component 
reflecting disease activity, the most important endpoints relate to relapses (clinical) and MRI findings 
(new  or  enlarging  T2/FLAIR  lesions  and  Gadolinium-enhancing  T1  lesions),  representing  acute 
inflammation. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In addition  to treatments approved for  the  symptomatic treatment of  MS including corticosteroids for 
the treatment of relapses, fingolimod is the only DMT as of yet explicitly approved in the EU for paediatric 
patients  aged  10  years  and  older  with  highly  active  RRMS.  Interferon-beta  (interferon-beta  1a  and 
interferon-beta 1b) and glatiramer acetate are widely used to treat paediatric MS as their indications do 
not have an age limit and therefore, formally include children. However, limited efficacy and safety data 
in the paediatric population have been collected for the use of these DMTs in paediatric patients.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
In  support  of  efficacy,  study  EFC11759  (also  referred  to  as  study  TERIKIDS)  was  presented.  Study 
EFC11759 is a two-year, multicenter, randomized, DB, placebo-controlled, parallel group trial to evaluate 
efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of teriflunomide (n = 109) vs. placebo (n = 57) administered orally 
once daily in paediatric patients with RMS followed by an OL extension. 
The implementation of the placebo arm was combined with switch criteria, i.e. patients who experienced 
a  confirmed  relapse  after  the  PK  run-in  phase  (8  weeks)  had  the  option  to  switch  to  the  OL  period. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289596/2021  
Page 92/109 
 
 
 
 
 
Similarly, patients with high MRI activity according to strict definitions qualified for early switch to the 
OL teriflunomide treatment arm. 
The  study  included  children  aged  10  to  <18  years  old  suffering  from  RRMS,  diagnosed  based  on  the 
McDonald criteria 2010 and the IPMSSG criteria for paediatric MS, version of 2012 with an EDSS score 
≤5.5 and last relapse  more than 30 days  prior  to  randomization.  With regard to disease  activity, the 
following criteria had to be met: 
- 
- 
at least one relapse (or attack) in the 12 months preceding screening or, 
at least two relapses (or attack) in the 24 months preceding screening. 
Subjects could be MS-treatment naïve or could have received prior MS DMT. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint was “time to first clinical relapse”. Confirmed clinical relapse occurred in 36.7% in 
the teriflunomide group and in 43.9% in the placebo group in the DB period, corresponding to a relative 
risk reduction of 34.3% (HR: 0.657; 95% CI: 0.388 to 1.113, p=0.2949).  
Patients in the placebo group experienced the first confirmed relapse after randomization earlier than 
patients in the teriflunomide group; the reported median duration was 39.14 weeks versus 75.29 weeks, 
respectively;  the  reported  mean  and  SD  were  49.25  (33.36)  weeks  versus  62.60  [36.12]  weeks, 
respectively.  
The  “time  to  first  relapse”  was  slightly  prolonged  for  teriflunomide  compared  to  placebo:  relapse 
probability was higher for placebo from approximately week 12 onwards compared to teriflunomide with 
29.8% of patients that relapsed by week 48 in the teriflunomide arm compared to 39.1% in the placebo 
arm.  
Overall,  treatment  with  teriflunomide  in  comparison  to  placebo  did  not  meet  the  primary  endpoint, 
however with regard to the sensitivity analysis “time to first confirmed clinical relapse or high MRI activity 
meeting criteria for switching into  OL period, whichever came first”, teriflunomide reduced the risk of 
confirmed  clinical  relapse  or  high  MRI  activity,  whichever  came  first,  when  compared  to  placebo  by 
43.4% (49.5% of patients in the teriflunomide group versus 68.4% of patients in the placebo group; 
HR:  0.566;  95%  CI:  0.368  to  0.870,  p=0.0409).  Patients  in  the  placebo  group  experienced  the  first 
confirmed relapse or high MRI activity meeting criteria earlier than patients in the teriflunomide group 
(median duration of 37.00 weeks and 72.14 weeks, respectively). 
Regarding the sensitivity analysis “time to first confirmed clinical relapse occurring after the PK run-in 
phase”,  that  excluded  clinical  relapses  that  occurred  during  the  PK  run-in  phase,  the  proportion  of 
patients with clinical relapse was 32.7% in the teriflunomide group versus 51.0% in the placebo group 
(HR: 0.507; 95% CI: 0.282 to 0.911, p=0.0815). 
The key secondary endpoints were the number of new/newly enlarged T2 lesions and the number of Gd-
enhancing T1 lesions. A (nominal) significant reduction in the rate of new or enlarged T2 lesions per MRI 
scan was demonstrated with teriflunomide, compared to placebo (4.7 and 10.5 lesions, respectively), 
(p=0.0006)  (unadjusted  analysis,  pre-specified),  corresponding  to  a  55%  reduction  over  the  DB 
treatment  period  (rate  ratio  [RR]:  0.450;  95%  CI:  0.285  to  0.711).  With  adjustment  for  baseline  T2 
lesion count, a (nominal) significant reduction in the rate of new or enlarged T2 lesions per MRI scan 
was  demonstrated  with  teriflunomide,  compared  to  placebo  (3,6  and  5,4  lesions,  respectively)  (p  = 
0.0446),  corresponding  to  a  33%  reduction  over  the  DB  treatment  period  (rate  ratio  [RR]:  0.665; 
95%CI: 0.447 to 0.990). Also, a (nominal) significant reduction in the rate of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions 
was  demonstrated  with  teriflunomide  (p<0.0001),  compared  to  placebo  (1.9  and  7.5  lesions, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289596/2021  
Page 93/109 
 
 
 
 
respectively), corresponding to a 75% reduction at the end of the DB treatment period (RR: 0.253; 95% 
CI:  0.126  to  0.505).  While  post-baseline,  the  mean  number  of  T1  Gd-enhancing  lesions  in  the 
teriflunomide group declined from 3.9 at baseline to 1.4, the mean number of T1 Gd-enhancing lesions 
in the placebo group increased from 3.9 at baseline to 5.1. 
Descriptively summarized results for the EDSS score: the mean (SD) EDSS score at baseline was 1.4 
(0.9) and 1.2 (0.9) for the placebo and the teriflunomide treatment group, respectively, while at week 
96  the  mean  (SD)  EDSS  score  was  1.7  (1.2)  and  1.2  (0.9)  respectively,  representing  a  slight 
deterioration under placebo of 0.3. Requested post-hoc analyses on CDP-6M, both for the DB treatment 
period and for the first 96 weeks regardless of patients discontinuing the DB-period and switching to OL 
teriflunomide,  showed  that  only  few  patients  experienced  a  CDP-6M  in  the  DB  period  with  2  (3.5%) 
patients in the placebo group and 5 (4.6%) patients under teriflunomide treatment. During the 96-week 
period, better results were provided for CDP-6M in the active treatment arm with 8 (14.0%) patients in 
the placebo group and 9 (8.3%) patients in the teriflunomide group who experienced a CDP-6M. 
Regarding  the  extrapolation  exercise  using  data  from  the  adult  RMS  population  the  Applicant  has 
demonstrated that integration of the adult MRI data into the paediatric data population in a Bayesian 
way does not change the results considerably. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No dedicated dose response study was conducted. A paediatric popPK model was developed to support 
definition of the daily dose to be administered to reach similar exposure in paediatric patients as in adults 
being treated with 14 mg once daily. The presented popPK model was based on an interim paediatric 
database only and had severe limitations (e.g. inadequate estimation of absorption rate constant, thus 
inadequate estimation of exposure, important underprediction of higher concentrations). Upon request, 
the Applicant updated the model during the procedure; however, uncertainties on model appropriateness 
remained.  Further  information  was  provided  during  the  procedure  and  no  clear  pattern  of  higher 
exposure in patients with lower BW in the BW range between 40 and 60 kg (in steps of 5 kg BW bands) 
was  visible,  which  would  necessitate  to  increase  the  BW  cut-off  for  same  dose  as  in  adults.  With  the 
updated information on model quality, confidence in the performance of the model has been increased. 
Simulations based on the updated paediatric popPK model, including a worst case scenario on patients 
weighing 25 kg (corresponding to the 5th percentile of 10-year-old children) confirmed that exposures 
in paediatric patients with the proposed dosing will be in the same range as seen in adults treated with 
14 mg once daily.  
Study EFC11759 failed its primary endpoint “time to first clinical relapse” (p=0.2949). With regard to 
the KM plot of time to first confirmed relapse the proportional Hazards assumption is not fulfilled. Up to 
about 24 weeks there is almost no difference between estimated relapse rates (although relapses were 
slightly more frequent for teriflunomide) and from week 36/48 onwards, the curves are almost parallel 
(although  numbers  at  risk  are  low  at the  end  of  the  curves).  The  most  informative  part  seems  to  be 
restricted to the time between 24 to 24/36 weeks. Consequently, the power of the study to detect the 
observed  difference  in  Kaplan-Meier  curves  is  reduced.    Furthermore,  for  this  analysis,  patients  are 
censored at time of high MRI activity (most at week 36) which is questionable given that censoring is 
highly informative.  
A number of sensitivity analyses were performed for the primary endpoint that showed consistent results 
in comparison to the primary analysis. The sensitivity analyses in general and in particular the one, that 
comprised criteria of a composite endpoint by counting in addition to relapse also high MRI activity as 
an event, could have supported a significant primary analysis. However, since hierarchical testing was 
foreseen  in  the  SAP  and  the  primary  analysis  failed  to  show  statistical  significance,  formally,  no 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289596/2021  
Page 94/109 
 
 
 
 
confirmatory conclusion can be drawn from this additional analysis, representing nominally significant 
differences for teriflunomide in comparison to placebo. 
It was planned to control the type 1 error for the two key secondary endpoints via hierarchical testing. 
However,  as  the  primary  endpoint  failed,  statistical  significance  for  downstream  endpoints  cannot  be 
formally claimed. 
With regard to the requested sensitivity analysis for the number of new/newly enlarged T2 lesions the 
Applicant  took  the  number  of  T2  lesions  into  account  as  the  number  of  new/enlarged  T2  lesions  is 
assessed in reference to the MRI scans of the previous visit. Thus, it is not a value that could be presented 
at baseline: A (nominal) significant reduction in the rate of new or enlarged T2 lesions per MRI scan was 
demonstrated with teriflunomide, compared to placebo (3,6 and 5,4 lesions, respectively) (p = 0.0446), 
corresponding to a 33% reduction over the DB treatment period (rate ratio [RR]: 0.665; 95%CI: 0.447 
to 0.990). The relative risk reduction in this analysis (with adjustment for baseline T2 lesion count) is 
lower compared to the 55% relative reduction in the pre-defined analysis (estimated without adjusting 
for baseline T2 lesion count). This might be due to some baseline imbalances in T2 lesions (mean of 51 
vs 60) favouring placebo in the unadjusted analysis. In sum, although both analyses showed a nominally 
significant  effect,  the  adjusted  analysis  reduced  considerably  the  effect  size  due  to  the  reported 
considerable baseline differences. Whereas results from the combined data of DB and OL phase could 
have been reassuring and even conservative due to the switch from placebo to the active treatment, the 
large  amount  of  remaining  missing  scans  does  not  allow  for  a  confirming  conclusion.    The  Applicant 
confirmed that the additional value of the analyses including OL data is limited. Overall, results are still 
supportive of the efficacy of teriflunomide on the key secondary MRI endpoints of new and enlarged T2 
lesions and T1 Gd-enhancing lesions per scan. 
Further requested and provided post-hoc analyses showed, that the results do not appear to be robust 
when relevant missing data imputation is applied in a setting with large proportion of missing data in the 
DB  period.  70%  of  placebo  patients  and  47%  of  teriflunomide  patients  had  MRI  data  to  be  imputed. 
Referring to the number of missing scans, this lack of robustness cannot be rebutted by an analysis on 
all MRI scans, including those taken in the  OL period, since the number of additional scans in the  OL 
period remains small compared to the number of remaining missing scans. Whereas the large amount 
of  missing  data  itself  raises  concerns  about  the  robustness  of  the  data,  the  conservative  sensitivity 
analyses with reference-based imputed data considerably reduce the treatment effect and, consequently, 
nominal statistical significance is lost. Taking into account, that this reduction in effect is mainly due to 
the imputation in the active treatment group and considering the fact that missing data in most cases 
occurred after patients had switched to the OL phase because of having experienced a relapse or a high 
MRI  activity,  obviously  correlated  with  an  unfavourable  outcome  in  the  key  secondary  endpoints,  the 
requested reference-based imputation method appears justified as a sensitivity analysis. Due to the large 
amount of missing data, it appears informative to use a missing data imputation method that is capable 
to model a vanishing effect difference in patients with missing MRI data, even if this can be considered 
as rather conservative. Applying this approach the effect is critically reduced (i.e. approximately halved) 
and the nominal statistical significance disappears. 
Due to the switch to OL rescue treatment which was disproportionately higher in the placebo group 
compared to the teriflunomide group analyses on CDP-6M are difficult to interpret. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of teriflunomide in paediatrics 10 to 17 years of age has been examined in a single 
controlled phase 3 study including 166 patients, 109 of whom were treated with teriflunomide and 57 
with placebo. Controlled safety data amount to 145.6 patient-years for the teriflunomide group. Up to 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289596/2021  
Page 95/109 
 
 
 
 
the  cut-off  date  of  12  September  2020,  uncontrolled  duration  of  exposure  added  approximately  260 
patient-years  for  teriflunomide  (7  and  14  mg).  Teriflunomide  was  well  tolerated,  with  a  low  rate  of 
discontinuations and temporary discontinuations from treatment due to TEAEs (5.5% each) and a similar 
incidence of SAEs in treatment groups (11%). The system organ classes with the highest proportions of 
subjects  reporting  TEAEs  were  Infections  and  Infestations,  Skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders, 
Nervous System Disorders, Gastrointestinal disorders, and Investigations. 
Hepatic adverse effects are an identified risk related with teriflunomide treatment and mainly present 
with asymptomatic increases in ALT starting at Week 4 and most frequently within the first 6 months of 
treatment.  Abnormalities,  i.e.  ALT  >  2x  ULN  up  to  >  10x  ULN  were  reported  for  7  patients  in  the 
teriflunomide group but in no subject on placebo. Of these 7 patients with hepatic abnormalities, two 
reported  an  SAE  and  one  subject  had  to  discontinue  treatment.  All  of  them  recovered.  Liver  enzyme 
increases  were  generally  not  associated  with  hepatic  TEAEs.  No  increased  incidence  of  hepatic 
abnormalities  was  reported  during  treatment  with  teriflunomide  in  the  OL  period,  with  a  total  of  5 
patients, who discontinued during this period. None of the patients treated with teriflunomide met the 
criteria  for  Hy’s  law.  Treatment  with  teriflunomide  is  contraindicated  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic 
impairment  (Child-Pugh  class  C).  Baseline  and  routine  monitoring  of  liver  enzymes  is  detailed  in  the 
SmPC. 
Pancreatic effects/ disorders is an identified risk related to teriflunomide treatment in adults, a signal 
that initially derived from preclinical studies in dogs. TEAEs related to pancreatic effects include isolated 
and asymptomatic pancreatic enzyme increases, that were found increased in paediatric patients treated 
with  teriflunomide  compared  to  placebo  (3.7%  vs.  1.8%).  Pancreatitis  (acute)  was  reported  in  5 
teriflunomide-treated  patients  (2  during  DB  and  3  during  OL  treatment)  confirmed  by  imaging  data. 
Time-to-onset of these events was > 11 months and up to 3 years. The pancreatitis cases presented 
with epigastric pain, high lipase (and amylase) leading to hospitalisation and treatment discontinuation. 
All patients recovered/ were recovering from pancreatitis after teriflunomide discontinuation and AEP. In 
one  of  the  patients  with  pancreatitis  in  the  OL  period,  diagnosis  was  “pancreatic  neoplasm”.  In  one 
patient (DB  period),  isolated and asymptomatic high  lipase values (hyperlipasemia) were reported as 
reason for discontinuation. The patient presented with normal imaging. 
Haematological effects (bone marrow disorders) are an identified risk with teriflunomide presenting with 
decreases  in  leukocyte  counts,  mainly  neutrophils  and  lymphocytes.  The  incidence  of  such  TEAEs  in 
paediatrics was higher for teriflunomide as compared to placebo (7.3% vs. 1.8%) but in line with adults 
and did not lead to discontinuation of treatment. A single patient with a SAE of cyclic neutropenia (pre-
existing)  was  reported  in  the  study.  RMMs  include  regular  monitoring  of  blood  cell  counts  during 
treatment and a contraindication in patients with pre-existing impaired bone marrow function/ significant 
leukopenia. 
The overall rate of infections in the DB period was higher for the teriflunomide group as compared to 
placebo  (66.1%  vs.  45.6%),  driven  by  unspecific,  seasonal  and  non-serious  infections  of  the  upper 
respiratory  tract  and  nasopharyngitis.  The  incidence  of  infection  SAEs  was  low  and  identical  in  both 
groups (1.8%): two SAEs occurred in the teriflunomide group, one of which was an opportunistic infection 
(pulmonary tuberculosis) which led to discontinuation of teriflunomide. Reporting of TEAEs during the 
OL period did not exceed DB incidences. 
The designated AESI of pulmonary disorders derives from the identified risk of interstitial lung disease 
that has been reported with the parent compound leflunomide and postmarketing with teriflunomide in 
adults.  No  case  of  ILD  has  been  reported  in  study  EFC11759.  Pulmonary  disorders  TEAEs  were  more 
frequently reported with teriflunomide as compared to placebo (63.3% vs. 43.9%) driven by TEAEs from 
the infections and infestations SOC.

Peripheral neuropathy was experienced by one patient in each treatment group during the DB period. 
During  the  OL  period,  3.0%  in  the  teriflunomide/  teriflunomide  group  and  3.8%  in  the  placebo/ 
teriflunomide group experienced peripheral neuropathy. One of these patients discontinued teriflunomide 
due to a nonserious TEAE of peripheral neuropathy confirmed by nerve conduction testing. 
The  rate  of  gastrointestinal  disorders  (nausea  and  diarrhoea;  7  to  8%  in  both  groups)  in  paediatrics 
appears not different from adults and events were most frequently reported during the first week(s) of 
treatment. TEAEs did not lead to discontinuation from treatment. 
Reversible  alopecia/  hair  loss  is  commonly  associated  with  teriflunomide  in  adults  and  was  similarly 
reported  in  paediatrics  early  during  treatment  (within  the  first  6  months):  22%  of  patients  on 
teriflunomide and 12% of placebo-treated patients. 
No malignancies were reported in study EFC11759. 
TEAEs  in  line  with  hypersensitivity  reactions  or  hypertension,  both  of  which  are  identified  risks  with 
teriflunomide, were not reported during the DB period. 
Three pregnancies were reported while patients were treated with teriflunomide during study EFC11759, 
two of which resulted in termination of pregnancy, and the other resulted in delivery of a healthy infant 
with no signs of malformations. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Overall, the safety profile in paediatrics is based on a limited controlled dataset of 109 patients exposed 
to teriflunomide in study EFC11759. Preliminary long-term data are available for an additional 2 years 
of OL teriflunomide treatment (data cut-off of 12 September 2020). 
Few data are available regarding the most vulnerable subpopulations (< 13 years, Tanner stage I, BW 
≤ 40 kg) for which interpretability of safety is difficult, especially with regard to long-term clinical safety: 
•  Age: mean age was 14.6 years. Only 16 patients on teriflunomide and 10 patients on placebo (i.e. 
26 out of 166 patients) were < 13 years. 
•  Body Weight: only 5 patients on teriflunomide (and 6 patients on placebo) in the DB period had a 
BW of ≤40 kg. These patients were treated with a dose of 7 mg. 
• 
Physical development: only 10 patients were pre-pubertal (6 %; 5 patients per group) reflected by 
Tanner Stage I at baseline. The progress rate in sexual maturation is scientifically based on approx. 
1 Tanner stage per year (i.e. it is assumed that paediatrics do not progress more than 2 Tanner 
stages in a 96-week period). From the limited available data in paediatrics with a Tanner stages I, 
II, or III at baseline, who completed 96-week treatment during the DB period, teriflunomide was 
not found to affect sexual maturation.  
Uncertainty has been raised with regard to the initial teriflunomide doses applied during the study, i.e. 
a  7  mg  adult  equivalent  dose  during  the  first  8  weeks  followed  by  a  14  mg  adult  equivalent  dose 
thereafter. Based on an indirect comparison of TEAEs and reporting of early discontinuations during the 
first 8 weeks and between Week 8 and Week 16 (after obtaining the full adult equivalent dose), there is 
no  evidence  for  an  increased  risk  of  tolerability  issues  like  gastrointestinal  disorders  (nausea  and 
diarrhoea)  and  alopecia.  These  are  known  to  emerge  dose-related  and  early  during  treatment. 
Notwithstanding, it cannot be excluded that some of these tolerability TEAEs might have been mitigated 
upon “titration” of teriflunomide in the study from half the adult dose equivalent during the first 8 weeks 
to  the  full  adult  dose  equivalent  thereafter.  In  addition,  the  numbers  of  subjects  with  TEAEs  in  this 
analysis  are  small  hampering  the  evaluation  of  clear  trends.  Of  note,  alopecia  was  more  frequently 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289596/2021  
Page 97/109 
 
 
 
 
reported in paediatric patients compared to adult patients (based on controlled clinical data comparison) 
and also led to discontinuation in a single patient during the OL period (alopecia areata). 
Moreover, adequacy of the dose in paediatrics has been questioned given that a number of paediatric 
patients  with  BW  in  line  with  adult  subjects  had  higher  AUC  and  minimum  concentration  values; 
therefore, a potential relation between exposure and occurrence of AEs, especially the 5 patients with 
events of pancreatitis, could have been claimed.  
However,  no  clear  correlation  between  exposure  and  safety  issues  could  be  retrieved  based  on  the 
information given during the procedure.  
Hepatic  effects  were  reported  with  a  lower  incidence  in  paediatric  patients  as  compared  to  adults  in 
controlled trials (3.5% and 4.6% in  the placebo  and  teriflunomide group in  paediatrics versus 15.2% 
and 21.5% in adults). It remains elusive whether less frequent liver enzyme monitoring applied in the 
paediatric study (every 4 weeks instead of every 2 weeks in adult clinical trials) explains this difference. 
Moreover,  given  that  liver  enzyme  abnormalities  were  reported  as  usually  starting  at  Week  4,  the 
implication of the reduced dose during the first 8 weeks on the reporting rate remains unclear. It remains 
undetermined whether a single case reported as DILI in the patient’s narrative is confounded by previous 
minocycline treatment. Variation procedures EMEA/H/C/002514/II/0029 and EMEA/H/C/002514/II/0032 
on the signal of DILI and implementation of warnings have meanwhile been approved. The outcome with 
regard to measurement of liver enzymes at least every four weeks during the first 6 months of treatment 
and regularly thereafter roughly complies with the schedule applied in EFC11759 and based on a similar 
hepatic safety in paediatrics and adults, this is likewise applicable to paediatric patients. 
Uncertainties  pertain  to  the  occurrence  of  pancreatic  effects,  especially  cases  of  (acute)  pancreatitis, 
which were reported more frequently in the small paediatric population in EFC11759 (5 of 166 patients) 
as  compared  to  adult  patients  in  clinical  trials,  and  for  which  an  increased  risk  in  the  post-marketing 
setting cannot be excluded. At present, baseline and serial measurement of pancreatic enzymes is not 
scientifically  justified  based  on  the  lack  of  specificity  of  lipase  as  a  biomarker  for  pancreas  toxicity. 
However, the Applicant agreed to implement information on obtaining pancreatic enzymes and related 
laboratory parameters in patients with suspected pancreatitis during treatment and discontinuation of 
teriflunomide if pancreatitis is confirmed. 
Review of pancreatic events in the GPV database and summarised in a safety update report retrieved 
adult cases of pancreatitis necrotising and pseudocyst, known complications of pancreatitis, which have 
been  included  in  the  description  of  selected  adverse  drug  reactions  in  section  4.8  of  the  product 
information. Although, these complications have not been reported in paediatrics, they remain of concern 
in  the  young  patient  population  given  that  these  presentations  necessitate  further  intervention  (e.g. 
surgery in case of pseudocyst) or could entail  life-long functional impairment of the pancreas. In this 
context, one of the four patients presenting with pancreatitis was diagnosed with medically significant 
“pancreatic  neoplasm”  317  days  after  initiation  of  teriflunomide,  described  as  “pseudo  papilloma  and 
inflammatory  lesions”.  Insufficient  clarification  of  histology  findings  hampers  classification  of  this 
neoplasia and determination of a causal relationship with teriflunomide, which could have had at least a 
contributing effect to this serious adverse event. 
During  the  DB  period,  a  serious  opportunistic  infection  of  pulmonary  tuberculosis  was  reported  in  a 
patient  on  teriflunomide,  which  resolved  with  anti-infective  treatment  and  discontinuation  of 
teriflunomide. During the OL period, the only serious opportunistic infection was coded as CNS infection, 
for  which  viral  encephalitis  in  the  absence  of  a  pathogen  was  reported.  Additional  nonserious 
opportunistic  infections  occurred  during  OL  teriflunomide,  i.e.  herpes  virus  infection,  herpes  zoster 
infection,  mycoplasma  infection,  and  varicella  infection  (concerning  5.8%  and  2%  of  patients  in  the 
placebo/  teriflunomide  group  and  in  the  teriflunomide/  teriflunomide  group).  Based  on  additional 
analyses for opportunistic infections in paediatrics, the risk seems to be comparable to that in adults.

Teriflunomide elicits reproductive toxicity by inhibiting DNA synthesis and crossing the placental barrier 
and is thus contraindicated during pregnancy or in women of childbearing potential not  using reliable 
contraception during treatment with teriflunomide. The occurrence of undesired pregnancies is of special 
importance  in  adolescents.  Additional  risk  minimisation  measures  to  specifically  address  the  new 
population of girls becoming fertile, and teenagers will include additional key safety messages in the HCP 
guide and in the patient  card, as well as development of a QR code for the patient card. In addition, 
pregnancies (including in patients <18 years) will be followed in the ongoing pregnancy registry. 
Blood CPK increased was reported as TEAE in the teriflunomide group only (5.5% vs. 0% on placebo). 
Serious  blood  creatine  phosphokinase  increased  AEs  were  reported  in  two  patients  on  teriflunomide 
during the DB period. The proportion of patients with high creatine kinase abnormalities (≥3x ULN) was 
higher in the teriflunomide group as compared to the placebo group (8.3% versus 3.6%) during the DB 
period.  Based  on  similar exposures  to  teriflunomide  in  paediatric  and  adult  clinical  controlled  studies, 
increases in CPK were more frequently observed in paediatrics (5.5% vs. 1.6%). In four narratives on 
SAEs  in  the  DB  and  OL  period,  blood  CPK  increased  was  concomitantly  reported  with  ALT  increased. 
Although, the Applicant provided alternative causes for these concomitantly increased parameters in two 
patients,  i.e.  trauma  and  intensive  bodybuilding,  it  remains  uncertain  to  which  extent  teriflunomide 
contributed to these SAEs given its known hepatic profile.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The efficacy of teriflunomide in the treatment of RRMS has already been established in adult patients. 
The  Applicant  is  now  seeking  extension  of  the  indication  to  paediatric  RRMS  patients  (≥10  and  <  18 
years of age). 
In the paediatric study EFC11759 (TERIKIDS) the primary endpoint “time to first clinical relapse” only 
numerically  favoured  teriflunomide  in  comparison  to  placebo  (p=0.2949).  TERIKIDS  is  therefore  a 
formally failed study. The effect size has likely been influenced by the justified and adequately defined 
switch criteria for patients experiencing new MRI disease activity to the OL teriflunomide treatment arm. 
In  this  context,  the  so-called  sensitivity  analysis  “time  to  first  confirmed  clinical  relapse  or  high  MRI 
activity meeting criteria for switching into OL period, whichever came first”, is of high clinical relevance 
as it reflects clinical practise. Patients with high disease activity on MRI are usually started on (another) 
active treatment without waiting for a relapse to occur. The Applicant requested a PIP modification with 
the aim to change the primary endpoint into this composite endpoint, while, according to the Applicant, 
the study was still blinded. However, PDCO and the FDA did not agree to change the primary endpoint 
due to the study being far advanced and advised to take the pre-planned sensitivity analyses into account 
when assessing the efficacy data of the study.  
This composite endpoint, counting in addition to relapse also high MRI activity as an event, yielded a 
nominally statistically significant result in favour of teriflunomide. However, since the primary analysis 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/289596/2021  
Page 102/109 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
failed  to  show  statistical  significance,  no  confirmatory  conclusion  can  be  made  from  this  additional 
analysis.  
The same pertains to the key secondary endpoints, the number of new/newly enlarged T2 lesions and 
the number of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions. A nominally statistically significant reduction in the rate of new 
or  enlarged  T2  lesions  per  MRI  scan  was  demonstrated  with  teriflunomide,  compared  to  placebo 
(unadjusted  analysis:  p  =  0.0006;  adjusted  analysis  by  baseline  T2  lesions  (  not  pre-specified):  p= 
0.0446). Also, a nominally statistically significant reduction in the rate of Gd-enhancing T1 lesions was 
demonstrated with teriflunomide (p<0.0001), compared to placebo. It was planned to control the type 
1 error for the two key secondary endpoints via hierarchical testing. However, as the primary endpoint 
failed, results for these endpoints need to be considered only descriptive and exploratory.  
As to be expected in the paediatric MS population with a generally rather low disability progression, no 
relevant changes in EDSS scores were seen from study start until the end of the 96 weeks period.  
Regarding the extrapolation exercise using data from the adult RMS population treated with teriflunomide 
the Applicant has demonstrated that integration of the adult MRI data into the paediatric data population 
in a Bayesian way does not change the results considerably.  
Overall,  although  the  study  failed,  results  in  general  are  indicative  of  an  effect  of  teriflunomide  on 
inflammation  in  the  paediatric  MS  population.  Of  note,  genetic,  serum,  CSF,  and  cell-based  studies 
support a shared biology between paediatric-onset and adult-onset disease. Therefore, it can principally 
be assumed that a drug that has been proven to be effective in adult RRMS will likewise be effective in 
paediatric RRMS if an equivalent dose is administered.  
Uncertainties have been raised on the appropriate BW cut-off for dosing with the same dose as in adults. 
Regarding paediatric patients with a BW equal or below 40 kg, the revised presentation of the population 
predictions versus observed concentrations increases confidence in the performance of the model in that 
the proposed dosing provides an exposure in paediatrics matching the adult reference range. This could 
be confirmed by comparison of individual observed exposure between paediatric subgroups (below and 
above 40 kg) and the adult reference group as well as by simulations of a worst-case scenario of patients 
weighing 25 kg (corresponding to the 5th percentile of 10-year-old children). Moreover, no clear pattern 
of  higher  exposure  in  patients  in  the  BW  range  between  40  and  60  kg  was  noted  and  a  correlation 
between exposure and safety issues could not be established.  
Nevertheless, the initially proposed every other day dosing of 14 mg for patients with BW<40Kg is not 
acceptable due to a lack of data in support of this regimen and the inability of the model to support this 
dosing regimen. During the procedure, the Applicant withdraw this proposal and therefore, the proposed 
posology for children with BW<40kg is 7mg daily.  
Overall, the safety database in paediatric patients, especially in the youngest pre-pubertal patients is 
limited, owing to the rarity of childhood-onset RRMS and availability of such patients for clinical trials.  
In addition, for interpretation of the paediatric safety data, the overall longer observation period in the 
teriflunomide compared to placebo arm due to the defined switch criteria needs to be considered, which 
is specifically relevant for TEAEs that occurred throughout the study, and for which the incidence in the 
placebo  arm  might  be  underestimated  (e.g.  recurrent  seasonal  infections  of  the  respiratory  tract). 
However, the pattern and incidences of adverse events with teriflunomide in paediatric RRMS patients 
observed  in  study  EFC11759  are  largely  in  line  with  those  in  the  adult  population  reported  in  clinical 
studies and postmarketing. Therefore, RMM already in place likewise apply to treatment of adults and 
paediatrics.  
No  new  safety  issues  have  been  identified,  but  the  reporting  of  pancreatic  effects  in  paediatrics  was 
increased  over  that  in  adults:  five  patients  presented  with  confirmed  pancreatitis  during  DB  and  OL 
Assessment report

teriflunomide treatment (no patient on placebo), which contrasts controlled clinical trial data in adults 
(no case of pancreatitis reported with teriflunomide). In paediatric patients, the most common causes 
for pancreatitis in adults, i.e. gallstones and alcoholism, can virtually be excluded. Autoimmune causes 
and genetic susceptibility probably responsible for the increased incidence of pancreatitis in paediatric 
patients can neither be refused nor be confirmed based on the narrative descriptions and given the lack 
of events in the placebo group. Together with the available experience in adults and presented data from 
the GPV database, it appears that the risk is higher in paediatric patients as compared to adult patients.  
More information was provided on the paediatric patients developing pancreatitis or pancreatic events 
during therapy with teriflunomide. A wide range of exposures (range 39.3 to 190 µg/ml for Ctrough) was 
noted in the 5 paediatric patients with pancreatitis and in a single patient with hyperlipasaemia. In five 
out  of  the  six  patients,  trough  concentrations  were  above  the  median  Ctrough  in  adult  patients  with 
values in three patients being above the 90% percentile of adult Ctroughs. This database is too limited to 
draw  conclusions  on  potential  dose  adjustment,  but  physicians  should  be  made  aware  of  the  high 
interindividual  exposure  in  patients  by  an  SmPC  statement.  The  Applicant  provided  reasonable 
justification  for  not  recommending  routine  pancreatic  enzymes  monitoring  during  treatment  with 
teriflunomide. Data in paediatrics are still limited to firmly conclude on a causality of the emergence of 
increased pancreatic enzymes and the complete clinical picture of pancreatitis. Nonetheless, in all of the 
pancreatitis  cases  reported  in  the  paediatric  teriflunomide  clinical  program,  pancreatitis  was 
accompanied  with  pancreatic  enzyme  increases  (either  or  both,  serum  lipase  and  amylase)  and 
confirmed  by  imaging  techniques.  It  is  agreed  that  baseline  and  serial  pancreatic  monitoring  is  not 
specifically  recommended  for  other  drugs  for  which  pancreas  toxicity  is  a  known  side  effect. 
Nevertheless, further information on and presentation of pancreatitis for such drugs is detailed in the 
label.  Diagnosis  of  pancreatitis  is  based  on  clinical  symptoms,  substantiated  by  pancreatic  enzyme 
measurement. This has been adequately described in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC also including 
the recommendation to discontinue teriflunomide in case of confirmation of pancreatitis. Post-marketing 
follow-up of pancreatitis by using targeted follow-up forms updated with specific questions on de- and 
re-challenge and any known results of genetic tests indicating an increased risk for pancreatitis as well 
as  a  question  about  any  anatomic  anomalies  potentially  associated  with  pancreatitis  is  considered 
acceptable.  
The applied dose regimen, which included an 8-week PK run-in phase with a reduced dose, might have 
mitigated  tolerability  issues,  i.e.  gastrointestinal  disorders  and  alopecia.  In  the  absence  of  data  for 
initiating  teriflunomide  at  the  full  adult  equivalent  dose  in  paediatrics,  an  indirect  comparison  was 
presented on the incidence of TEAEs and early discontinuations in the first 8 weeks of treatment and in 
the subsequent 8 weeks. These data do not indicate an increase in tolerability events between Weeks 8 
and 16 of treatment.  
Comparison of controlled clinical study data in adults and paediatrics revealed a slightly lower but overall 
similar incidence in hepatic abnormalities in paediatrics as compared to adult patients. Differences could 
possibly be related to the different monitoring algorithm in clinical studies (every 4 weeks in paediatrics 
instead of every 2 weeks in adults) and/ or to an effect of the reduced teriflunomide dose during the first 
8 weeks of treatment. With regard to the issue of drug-induced liver injury assessed in the meanwhile 
approved variation procedures EMEA/H/C/002514/II/0029 and EMEA/H/C/002514/II/0032, the outcome 
is likewise applicable to paediatrics, including extended monitoring intervals of at least every 4 weeks 
instead of every 2 weeks during the first 6 months of treatment and regularly thereafter, as proposed in 
SmPC section 4.4. 
Long-term safety data for teriflunomide in paediatric patients, especially in those being underrepresented 
in EFC11759, i.e. paediatrics aged < 13 years, those being pre-pubertal, or those with a BW < 40 kg, 
are limited. Given that extrapolation of safety from adult to paediatric patients is not straight forward, it 
is expected that the long-term safety profile is further characterised by additional data collected in the 
Assessment report

ongoing OL period of study EFC11759. Long-term safety is included as important missing information in 
the RMP. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The Applicant has presented one placebo-controlled study in RRMS patients aged 10 to <18 years. The 
study failed its primary endpoint “time to first clinical relapse after randomization up to the end of the 
DB treatment period” and thus efficacy of teriflunomide in the paediatric population with RRMS has not 
been formally demonstrated. 
However,  efficacy  has  already  been  demonstrated  in  adult  patients  with  RRMS  and,  based  on  shared 
biology, extrapolation to paediatric patients is in principle possible. Re-establishing efficacy on its own is 
not necessary. The totality of data and analyses provide clear evidence of efficacy of teriflunomide in 
paediatric patients with RRMS: 
•  The  predefined  “sensitivity  analysis”  “time  to  first  confirmed  clinical  relapse  or  high  MRI  activity 
meeting criteria for switching into  OL period, whichever came first” showed statistical significance, 
although only nominally, and is considered the clinically most relevant analysis. 
•  For the two key secondary MRI endpoints, number of new/newly enlarged T2 lesions and number of 
Gd-enhancing  T1  lesions  (nominal)  significant  reductions  have  been  shown  in  the  pre-specified 
analyses. Since these MRI parameters have been related to relapses and are often among the criteria 
chosen to reflect disease activity, they are considered to be important in this context. 
•  The  post-hoc  Bayesian  analysis  provided  by  the  Applicant  supports  significant  reductions  in  MRI 
lesions  with  teriflunomide  vs.  placebo  in  TERIKIDS  by  combining  adult  and  paediatric  data  using 
different  weights  attributed  to  the  adult  data.  However,  a  large  proportion  of  paediatric  MRI  data 
(being  an  essential  part  of  the  Bayesian  analysis)  was  missing  after  patients  had  switched  from 
placebo to teriflunomide. When applying a conservative imputation method (imputation with placebo 
data) for these missing MRI data, the effect was considerably reduced and failed to show statistical 
significance. This imputation approach is however considered too conservative. In addition, results 
still showed a relevant numerical effect.  
The totality of the provided and updated popPK data is now considered sufficient to support the 
proposed dosing regimen in paediatrics. 
The  safety  profile  of  teriflunomide  in  the  paediatric  RRMS  population  generally  presents  with  findings 
similar to adults, for whom the drug was approved in the European Union 7 years ago and for which risk 
minimisation measures proved efficacious. The limited number of  paediatric patients belonging to the 
most vulnerable subpopulation, i.e. those aged < 13 years, being pre-pubertal, or with a BW of < 40 kg, 
is  of  general  uncertainty,  although,  so  far  available  long-term  data  from  an  additional  two  years 
treatment with teriflunomide in the OL period do not point towards an increased susceptibility to adverse 
effects in these patients. At the same time, the limited long-term safety data, especially in the vulnerable 
subpopulation of the younger and prepubertal paediatric patients, needs to be addressed postmarketing. 
Therefore, additional long-term data are expected after completion of the OL period of study EFC11759. 
Moreover,  the  occurrence  of  TEAEs/SAEs  related  to  pancreatic  toxicity  in  pediatrics  appears  to  be 
increased over those in adults, which is now adequately reflected in the product information (sections 
4.4 and 4.8). Given that pancreatitis events in the paediatric study occurred between >11 months and 
up to 3 years, reporting of such events might increase with long-term treatment.

3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
N/A 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Aubagio in the extension of the application to include the treatment of paediatric 
patients 10 years of age and older with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the CHMP  considers  by  consensus 
decision that the benefit-risk balance of Aubagio 7mg is favourable in the following indication: 
Aubagio is indicated for the treatment of adult patients and paediatric patients aged 10 years 
and  older  with  relapsing  remitting  multiple  sclerosis  (MS)  (please  refer  to  section  5.1  for 
important information on the population for which efficacy has been established).

Additional Marketing protection  
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the sanofi-aventis groupe, taking into account 
the provisions of Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and considers that the new therapeutic 
indication brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies (see appendix 1). 
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0165/2017and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
In  addition,  CHMP  did  recommends  the  variation(s)  to  the  terms  of  the  marketing  authorisation,

Grouped application comprising two type II 
variations as follows: 
- To update sections 4.6 of the SmPC in order to 
include a recommendation to use effective 
contraception during treatment and for 14 days after 
the last dose if Xenpozyme is discontinued based on 
embryo-foetal study in mice (study TER0694). In 
addition, the MAH proposes an update of section 5.3 
of the SmPC based on a re-calculation of exposure 
margins for the embryo-foetal study. MAH also 
proposes to align the SmPC with the updated CCDS. 
- To update sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC in 
order to include data in lactating mice based on final 
results from study MSSM-1120 - Evaluation of 
Olipudase alfa Transfer Into Milk of Lactating Mice. 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
The RMP version 2.2 has also been submitted.

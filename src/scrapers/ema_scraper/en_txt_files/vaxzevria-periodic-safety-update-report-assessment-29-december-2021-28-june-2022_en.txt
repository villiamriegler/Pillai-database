Vaxzevria: Periodic safety update report assessment 
29th December 2021 to 28th June 2022  
This document consists of: 
1. The PRAC assessment report of the Vaxzevria periodic safety update report (PSUR) 
covering the period 29 December 2021 to 28 June 2022, and; 
2. The Vaxzevria PSUR itself.  
The PSUR is a pharmacovigilance document intended to provide an evaluation of the risk-
benefit balance of the medicinal product during the reference period mentioned above.  
The objective of the PSUR is to present a comprehensive and critical analysis of the risk-benefit 
balance of the product, taking into account new or emerging safety information in the context 
of cumulative information on risk and benefits. The marketing authorisation holder is legally 
required to submit PSURs at defined time points after the authorisation of a medicinal product. 
EMA’s safety committee, the PRAC, assesses information in the PSUR to determine if there are 
new risks identified for a medicine and/or if its risk-benefit balance has changed. The outcome 
of this assessment is summarised in the PRAC assessment report of the PSUR. 
The PSUR and the PRAC assessment report of the PSUR include information about suspected 
side effects, i.e. medical events that have been observed following the use of the vaccine, but 
which are not necessarily related to or caused by the vaccine itself. Information on suspected 
side effects should not be interpreted as meaning that the vaccine or the active substance 
causes the observed event or is unsafe to use.  
Only a detailed evaluation and scientific assessment of all available data, as 
described in the PRAC assessment report of the PSUR, can determine the impact of 
new data on the benefits and risks of a medicine. 
Further information on the safety of COVID-19 vaccines and on PSUR submission and 
assessment is available on the EMA website. 
This document may contain redactions for commercially confidential information (CCI) and 
protected personal data (PPD) in accordance with applicable legislation and guidance.

1. 
Background information on  the  procedure 
This  is  the assessment  of  PSUR(s)  submitted  in accordance with the  requirements  set  out  in  the list  of 
Union reference dates  (EURO  list)  for  COVID-19  Vaccine  (ChAdOxl-S  [recombinant])  (Vaxzevria). 
2.  Assessment  conclusions  and  actions 
This  is  the third  Periodic  Benefit-Risk Evaluation  Report (PBRER)  for  VAXZEVRIA  (AZD1222/ 
VAXZEVRIA).  It summarises  safety  and  efficacy/effectiveness data  for the  period from 29  December 
2021 to 28  June 2022,  and  places  it  in  the  context of the cumulative  data  and  the  overall  benefit risk 
profile. 
VAXZEVRIA  is  a  monovalent vaccine  composed  of a single recombinant,  replication-deficient chimpanzee 
adenovirus  (ChAdOxl)  vector encoding  the  S  glycoprotein  of SARS  CoV-2.  Following administration,  the  S 
glycoprotein  of SARS-CoV-2  is  expressed locally  stimulating neutralizing antibody and cellular immune 
responses. 
VAXZEVRIA  is  indicated for  active  immunization  of individuals  � 18 years  old for the  prevention  of  COVID-
19.  The VAXZEVRIA primary vaccination course consists of two separate doses  of 0. 5  ml each.  The 
second  dose should be administered between 4 and 12  weeks after the  first  dose.  A booster dose  (third 
dose)  of 0. 5  ml  may be  given  to  individuals  who completed the  primary  vaccination  course  with 
VAXZEVRIA  or  an  mRNA  COVID-19  vaccine  at  least  3-months  after completing the primary vaccination 
course. 
VAXZEVRIA  is  supplied  as  a vial containing  either 8 doses  or 10 doses per vial,  0. 5  ml  per dose  for 
intramuscular  (IM)  injection. 
VAXZEVRIA  was  first  authorised  for emergency use  in the  United  Kingdom  on 29  December 2021.  The 
vaccine received conditional marketing authorization in the  EU  on  29 January 2021.  As  of 28 June 
2022,  VAXZEVRIA has  been approved for conditional marketing authorisation  or  emergency use 
authorisation  in 93  countries.  VAXZEVRIA  is  distributed  via COVID-19  Vaccines  Global  Access  (COVAX)  to 
more than 80  countries 
During the  period under review: 
There were  no actions  taken  for  safety  reasons 
The  EU-SmPC  was  updated  to include  in  Section 4.8: 'Tinnitus'  (uncommon),  'Paraesthesia  / 
Hypoaesthesia'  (uncommon),  and 'Transverse  Myelitis' (Not known) 
Exposure 
The  estimated cumulative exposure of  clinical  trial  subjects  is  approximately 35,921 healthy 
volunteers  who  have  received  VAXZEVRIA and 1523 who have  received AZD2816. 
The  estimated cumulative exposure  from  post approval  experience  is  over  2,79  billion  doses 
distributed globally  and  over 2,09 billion doses  administered  worldwide.  In the  EU,  there  were 
approximately  69 million doses  administered  (i. e.  "'39  million  Dose 1,  "'30 million  Dose 2,  and 
~22,000  Booster  dose). 
Signals 
During the  period under review,  there  were 3 validated  signals  by  the  MAH: 
PRAC PSUR assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  4/123 
GBS:  closed;  considered  as  an  important  potential risk  by  the  MAH (categorised as an  important 
identified  risk  by  the  PRAC).  The MAH closed  a signal  of GBS based  on  a cumulative  review of  post­
marketing,  clinical and  literature  data.  The  cumulative  review  did not  provide  additional  information 
compared to the  data  discussed  in  the  previous  PBRER,  except  a few new articles published.  The 
PRAC  considers  that  the  available  data did not  change the current  knowledge  regarding GBS after 
Vaxzevria and  that GBS  is  appropriately  described  in  the  EU-PI  (sections  4.4  and 4. 8)  and  in  the  EU­
RMP (important identified risk),  and  no further action is required. 
There were two  signals  (Hypoaesthesia  and  Paraesthesia,  and Tinnitus) that were closed during  or 
shortly  after the  reporting interval.  Both signals  of "Paraesthesia and  hypoaesthesia" and "Tinnitus" 
were  assessed  in  the  context  of the  previous  PSUR  procedure  (late  breaking  information)  which led to 
the inclusion of the  3  events  in  the  section 4. 8  of the  EU-Sm PC  (i. e. ,  Paraesthesia [uncommon], 
Hypoaesthesia  [uncommon],  and Tinnitus  [uncommon]. 
After the  O LP,  the  MAH validated 2 signals: 
Immune thrombocytopenia  (ITP): The signal for ITP was re-opened based on  well-documented case 
reports  of  ITP with  VAXZEVRIA  from  the  published  literature.  ITP  is  listed  in  Section4. 8  of the  Eu­
SmPC  and  is an  Important  identified  risk  in  the  EU-RMP 
Cutaneous  vasculitis:  The  signal was  identified  based on  well-documented case series from published 
literature cases.  Subsequently a signal was  received from  PRAC.  This  led to the  inclusion  of cutaneous 
vasculitis  in  the  AD Rs  of  Vaxzevria in  Section 4. 8.  This  is  further  discussed  in  below Section 3  -
Recommendations. 
New safety  information 
During the  reporting period,  no  new  safety concerns  were  identified. 
The  safety  concerns  remained unchanged,  except 'Anaphylaxis' which was  removed from the  important 
identified  risks as  it  is  now considered fully characterised  and  no additional  RMM  are  ongoing  or  planned. 
During the  reporting period,  new  information  became  available  regarding Cutaneous  vasculitis. 
Cumulatively,  258  cases  were  identified,  including 12 cases  of rechallenge  all confirmed  as  BCC  Level  1-3. 
Based  on  the  evaluation  of currently  available  information,  the  MAH considers  that there  is  a reasonable 
possibility  of a causal  association  between  Vaxzevria  and cutaneous  vasculitis.  An  update  of the  EU-PI  is 
thus  requested  (see  below Section  - Recommendations). 
Several safety  topics  (Health Authority  Requests  and Other  identified risks not  categorised as 
important)  were under close monitoring during the reporting period.  Following the assessment  of these 
issues,  the  PRAC  concluded: 
To close the  monitoring  of Tinnitus,  Reactogenicity,  Paraesthesia/Hypoaesthesia,  Sarcoidosis, 
Subacute  thyroiditis,  Rhabdomyolysis,  Viral reactivation  (Non-Zoster),  Booster  dosing,  Myocarditis, 
and Exacerbation  of  diabetes,  adrenal  insufficiency and  hypertension. 
These  events  do  not need to be  further  discussed through PBRERs  unless significant new safety 
information  is  identified 
To continue the monitoring  of VTE,  ADEM,  Hearing loss,  Menstrual disorders (literature and  serious 
cases),  Glomerulonephritis  and  nephrotic syndrome  including  IgA  nephropathy  (literature  only)  and 
Fatal  cases.  In addition,  new  daily  persistent headache  should be reviewed. 
These topics  should  continue  to be discussed  in  the  next  PBRER. 
Moreover,  EMA validated 2 signals  after the  O LP: 
PRAC PSUR assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  5/123 
A  signal  of  Pemphigus/pemphigoid  was  validated  in  October 2022.  The  signal was  confirmed  on 1st 
Dec 2022.  The  MAH should  provide  additional  data  by 09.02. 2023  (see  ongoing procedure  SDA 113; 
EPITT  19858). 
A  signal  of  Myositis was  validated  in  December 2022 (EPITT 19882).  The signal is  confirmed  as a 
cumulative  review is  requested for the  next  PSUR (see  Section 4). 
Besides,  the WHO-UMC  shared  in  September 2022  (i. e.  after the  O LP)  a signal  on Severe cutaneous 
adverse  reactions  (SCAR).  This should  be  discussed in  the next  PBRER. 
New  benefit  information 
Regarding the  benefit,  there  are  some new  data  on  related to (i)  the use  of  Vaxzevria as  heterologous 
booster and  (ii)  a rapid waning  of antibody  titres  and  vaccine  effectiveness,  but  persistence  of 
effectiveness  against  severe  forms.  There are no new data  on  efficacy  that  alters  the conclusions  of 
previous  assessments,  which  are  describe  in  the  approved product  information. 
These  data  provide  supportive  evidence  of  Vaxzevria  immunogenicity and  safety  profile  when  used  as a 
heterologous  booster.  Yet,  these  findings  should be further explored in  the  Omicron  era. 
Benefit/risk  balance 
The  risk-benefit  balance  of  Vaxzevria remains unchanged.  However,  the  risks  of SARS-CoV-2  infection 
and the context  of treatment  and  prevention  of the disease  have  evolved.  TTS,  CVST and GBS,  the  key 
risks  identified  for  Vaxzevria,  have  been reported  more  frequently  in  young adults  who  benefit  less  from 
vaccination.  This  observation  led to question  the  B/R balance  in  the  younger population and  for  several 
EU Member States  to restrict  the  use  of the vaccine,  especially after more  alternative vaccines were made 
available. 
3. 
Recommendations 
Based  on  the  PRAC  review of data  on  safety and  efficacy,  the  PRAC considers  that  the  risk-benefit  balance 
of  medicinal  products  containing  COVID-19  Vaccine  (ChAdOxl-S  [recombinant])  (Vaxzevria)  remains 
unchanged but  recommends  that  the  terms  of the  marketing authorisation(s) should be  varied  as  follows: 
Scientific  conclusions  and  grounds  for variation to the terms of the marketing  authorisations 
In  view of available data  on cutaneous vasculitis  from literature  and  spontaneous  reporting including  in 
the majority  of cases a close  temporal relationship  and  in  some cases,  a positive rechallenge,  the  PRAC 
agrees  that  a  causal  relationship between COVID-19  Vaccine  (ChAdOxl-S  [recombinant])  (Vaxzevria)  and 
cutaneous  vasculitis  is  at  least  a reasonable  possibility. 
The  PRAC  concluded  that  the product information  of product containing COVID-19  Vaccine (ChAdOxl-S 
[recombinant])  (Vaxzevria)  should be amended accordingly. 
Precise scope: 
Update  of section 4. 8 of the Sm PC  to  add  cutaneous  vasculitis  with  a frequency 'not known'based on  data 
assessed  within  this  procedure.  The  Package  leaflet  is  updated  accordingly. 
The following changes  to  the  product  information  of medicinal products  containing  COVID-19  Vaccine 
(ChAdOxl-S  [recombinant])  (Vaxzevria)  are recommended  (new text underlined and  in  bold,  deleted

4.  Issues  to  be  addressed in  the  next  PSUR 
The  MAH(s)  should  also  address  the  following issues  in  the next  PSUR: 
Acute  disseminated  encephalomyelitis  (ADEM) 
The  MAH is  requested to  provide  a discussion of ADEM,  including but  not  be  limited to: 
(i) 
(ii) 
(iii) 
an  updated cumulative  review of cases  of ADEM, 
an  updated  literature  review,  with  a focus  on  new relevant epidemiological studies, 
a  discussion  on  the  need to  update  the  PI and/or RMP. 
Moreover,  the MAH is  requested to carefully  review the  evaluation  of cases  of ADEM as discrepancies 
regarding the  BCC  evaluation  (e.g.  case 
classified as  BCC  Level 2  whereas a 4-month  FU 
suggests  a  monophasic disease  course)  and WHO-UMC  causality assessment  (e. g.  case 
assessed  as  unlikely  due  to  incorrect TTO) have  been  noticed. 
Menstrual  disorders 
The  MAH is  requested to  provide  and discuss  an  updated  literature  review of  Menstrual  disorders. 
Besides,  the  MAH  is  requested to further discuss  the serious cases  requiring hospitalization  and  the cases 
resulting in death. 
Glomerulonephritis and  nephrotic  syndrome  including IgA nephropathy 
The  MAH is  requested  to  further  search for  literature  on  GN/SN  following  COVID-19 vaccination,  with a 
special focus  to  Adena-vectored vaccines,  relapse  and flare up,  and  measured  kidney  alterations after 
vaccination. 
Venous  Thromboembolism 
The  MAH is  requested to  further  investigate  VTE  by  providing  an  updated  literature  review,  with a focus 
on  new  relevant  epidemiological  studies. 
Thrombosis 
The  MAH is  requested to  provide  a tabular  summary of the fatal  cases  reporting a thrombotic  event after 
dose 3  ( or  dose 4)  of  the  vaccine. 
Use in  immunocompromised  patients 
The  MAH is  requested  to  verify the PTs reported  in  fatal  cases,  especially  regarding TTS and 
Thrombocytopenia. 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  7 /123 
Severe cutaneous  adverse  reactions  (SCAR) 
Following a  potential  signal  of SCAR identified  by WHO-UMC,  the  MAH is  requested to provide  a 
cumulative  review of cases  reported with  Vaxzevria together with a review of literature.  A discussion  on 
the need to  update  the  PI  should be included. 
Hearing loss 
The  MAH is  requested to  provide  and discuss  an  updated  review of hearing loss  cases  with  a  recovered 
with sequelae  or not  recovered  outcome. 
New  daily  persistent headache 
The  MAH is  requested to  provide  a cumulative  review of cases  of new daily  persistent headache  in 
association  with Vaxzevria,  including spontaneous  reports  and data  from the  literature  and  clinical trials. 
The  analysis  should  include  an  overall  discussion  of the  cases,  as  well as  an  individual causality 
assessment  of  each cases. 
Myositis 
A  signal  of  Myositis was  validated  in  December 2022  (EPITT  19882).  The signal is  confirmed,  and  a 
cumulative  review is  requested for the  next  PSUR.  Please,  refer to the  PRAC  recommendation  for the 
signal  of  myositis  with  Vaxzevria  (EPITT  no:  19882)  for  the list  of questions  to be addressed. 
5. 
PSUR frequency 
i:gjChanges  of  PSUR frequency  are  proposed 
The current  frequency  of submission should  be  changed from  6 months  to 1 year  at  the  first possibility. 
The list  of  Union  reference  dates  (EURO)  should  be  updated accordingly. 
The  next  PSUR should be submitted according  to the current  Euro  list  (i. e.  next  DLP:  28  December 
2022  and  next submission  date:  08  March 2023).  The  PSUR cycle  will  be updated  for the following 
PSUR  which  should submitted with a DLP of 28  December 2023. 
The request  to change the  PSUR frequency  is  supported by: 
The gain  of experience  with  Vaxzevria:  with more  than  2  billion  doses administered worldwide,  the 
safety  profile  of  Vaxzevria  is  becoming  well  known.  Moreover,  the  monitoring  of  most  of the  safety 
topics  followed  as 'Health authority  request' has  been  stopped  in  the  current  and  previous  PBRERs. 
No  change in  the indications of the  vaccine:  Currently,  no paediatric indication has  been submitted for 
Vaxzevria.  Regarding  the  booster  indication,  available data  do not  suggest  a different safety  profile 
for the booster dose. 
No  change in  the  composition of the  vaccine: The MAH did  not submit  any request  for  significant 
changes  in  the  component  of the  vaccine. 
Decrease  in  the use of Vaxzevria:  A sharp  decreased  in  the use of  Vaxzevria is  observed  in  the  EU as 
EU countries  do  not  favour  Vaxzevria for  booster vaccination  campaign.

1.  PSUR  Data 
1.1.  Introduction 
This  Periodic  Benefit Risk Evaluation Report  (PBRER)  for  COVID-19 Vaccine  (ChAdOxl-S  [recombinant]) 
(Vaxzevria)  covers  the  period from  29  December 2021 to 28 June 2022. 
The  International  Birth  Date  (IBD)  is 29  December 2020. 
VAXZEVRIA  is  a  monovalent vaccine  composed  of a single recombinant,  replication-deficient  chimpanzee 
adenovirus  (ChAdOxl)  vector encoding  the  S  glycoprotein  of Hunan-Hu-1  strain  of the  Severe Acute 
Respiratory  Coronavirus 2  (SARS  CoV-2).  Following  administration,  the  S  glycoprotein  of SARS CoV-2  is 
expressed locally  stimulating  neutralizing  antibody  and  cellular immune responses. 
VAXZEVRIA  is  indicated for  active  immunisation of individuals  � 18 years  for the prevention  of  COVID-19. 
VAXZEVRIA  is  supplied as  a vial containing  either 8 doses  or 10 doses per vial,  0. 5  ml  per dose  for 
intramuscular  (IM)  injection.  VAXZEVRIA vaccination course  consists  of two  separate doses of 0. 5  ml 
each.  The  second dose should  be  administered  between 4  and 12 weeks  after the  first dose.  It  is 
recommended that  individuals  who receive  a first dose  of  VAXZEVRIA  complete  the  vaccination course 
with  VAXZEVRIA.  A booster  dose  (third dose)  of 0. 5  ml  may  be  given  to  individuals  who  completed the 
primary  vaccination  course  with  VAXZEVRIA  or  another  authorised  COVID  19  vaccine.  The  third  dose 
should  be  administered  at  least 3 months after  completing  the primary vaccination course.  The status  of 
approval and  the  recommendation  in  national  prescribing  information  (Pl)  documents  relating to the 
booster  dose  vary. 
The  MAH  proposes  to  update the product  information  as  part  of the  submission  of this  PBRER  to  include 
cutaneous  vasculitis  in  section 4. 8  of the  SmPC  and  section 4  of the  PL. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
The booster indication  was approved on 15  May 2022 within the variation procedure 11/052. 
The  inclusion  of cutaneous  vasculitis  in  the  list  of ADR is  further discussed  in  Section 2. 3. 34 of this  AR. 
1.2.  Worldwide marketing authorisation  status 
VAXZEVRIA  was  first approved for  active immunisation in  individuals 18 years of age  and  older for the 
prevention of  COVID-19  in  United  Kingdom  (UK) on 29  December 2020.  It received conditional marketing 
authorisation  in  the  EU on 29 January  2021. 
VAXZEVRIA has  been  approved  either for conditional  marketing authorisation  or  emergency use 
authorisation  in 93  countries  managed by  AstraZeneca  and  its  partners  - Serum  Institute  of  India  (SIi), 
R-pharm,  Fiocruz,  and  Verity Pharmaceuticals.  VAXZEVRIA  is  also  distributed  via COVID-19  Vaccines 
Global Access  programme  (COVAX),  in collaboration  with  United  Nations  Children's  Fund  (UNICEF)  and 
Pan American Health Organization  (PAHO),  under  a World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  Emergency Use 
Listing to more  than  80  countries. 
The  MAH provided a summary  of the worldwide  marketing  authorisation  status  applicable  to  COVID  19 
VACCINE  ASTRAZENECA',  which  is  not copied here  but  can be retrieved from Table 1  of section 2  in 
PSUR#3.

1.3.  Overview of  exposure  and  safety data 
1.3.1.  Actions  taken  in  the  re porting interval  for safety  reasons 
No  significant  actions  related  to safety  were  taken  or proposed  during  the  reporting  period. 
1.3.2.  Changes to  reference  safety  information 
The reference  safety  information  is the Core  Data  Sheet  (CDS). 
The  VAXZEVRIA CDS in effect  at  the  beginning  of the  reporting  period was  dated  02  November  2021 
(version  10. 0).  During  this  reporting  period,  the  VAXZEVRIA CDS was  updated  to include  the  safety 
related changes summarised  in Table 1. 
For the purpose  of this PBRER,  the CDS dated 11  May 2022 (version 18.0),  is the reference  for both 
the benefit and  risk sections.

Hypersensitivity and  anaphylaxis 
[ ... ] Appropriate medical treatment and

An additional dose of the vaccine should not 
be given to those who have experienced a 
severe hypersensitivity reaction to a previous 
dose of  COVID-19  Vaccine AstraZeneca. 
[ ... ] Appropriate medical treatment and 
supervision should always be readily available 
[ ... ].  Close observation for at least 15  minutes 
is recommended following vaccination. 
An additional dose of the vaccine should not 
be given to those who have experienced 
anaphylaxis to a previous dose of Vaxzevria. 
Thromboembolism and thrombocytopenia 
[ ... ] Whilst specific risk factors for 
thromboembolism in combination with 
thrombocytopenia have not been identified, 
cases have occurred in patients with a 
previous history of thrombosis,  as well as in 
patients with autoimmune disorders, 
including immune thrombocytopenia. The 
benefits and risks of vaccination should be 
considered in these patients. 
Thromboembolism and thrombocytopenia 
Events of cerebrovascular venous and sinus 
thrombosis without thrombocytopenia have 
been reported very rarely following 
vaccination with Vaxzevria,  although a causal 
relationship has not been established. These 
events can be fatal and may require different 
treatment approaches than  TTS. 
Healthcare professionals should consult 
applicable guidance. 
Coagulation disorders - Thrombosis with

Coagulation disorders - Cerebrovascular 
venous and sinus thrombosis 
Events of cerebrovascular venous and sinus 
thrombosis without thrombocytopenia have 
been observed very rarely following 
vaccination with Vaxzevria. Some cases had a 
fatal outcome. The majority of these cases 
occurred within the first four weeks following 
vaccination.  This information  should be 
considered for individuals at increased risk for 
cerebrovascular venous and sinus  thrombosis. 
These events may require different treatment 
approaches than TTS and healthcare 
professionals should consult applicable 
guidance. 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  12/123 
I 
Thromboembolism and thrombocytopenia 
[ ... ]  Healthcare professionals should be alert 
to the signs and symptoms of 
thromboembolism and thrombocytopenia,  as 
well as coagulopathies. Vaccinated individuals 
should be instructed to seek immediate 
medical attention if they develop symptoms 
such as a severe or persistent headaches, 
blurred vision,  confusion,  seizures,  shortness 
of breath,  chest pain,  leg swelling,  leg pain, 
persistent abdominal pain or unusual skin 
bruising and or petechia a few days after 
vaccination. 
Individuals diagnosed with thrombocytopenia 
within 21  days of vaccination with  COVID-19 
Vaccine AstraZeneca,  should be actively 
investigated for signs of thrombosis. 
Similarly,  individuals who present with 
thrombosis within 21  days of vaccination 
should be evaluated for thrombocytopenia. 
I 
Coagulation disorders - Thrombocytopenia 
Cases of thrombocytopenia,  including immune 
thrombocytopenia  (ITP),  have been reported 
after receiving Vaxzevria,  typically within the 
first four weeks after vaccination. Very rarely, 
these presented with very low platelet levels 
( <20,000 per  µL)  and/or were associated with 
bleeding. Some of these cases occurred in 
individuals with a history of immune 
thrombocytopenia. Cases with fatal outcome 
have been reported. If an individual has a 
history of a thrombocytopenic disorder,  such 
as immune thrombocytopenia,  the risk of 
developing low platelet levels should be 
considered before administering the vaccine 
and platelet monitoring is recommended after 
vaccination. 
Coagulation disorders  (general  warning  for  all 
TTS,  CVST,  and  TP) 
Healthcare professionals should be alert to 
the signs and symptoms of  thromboembolism 
and/or thrombocytopenia. Those vaccinated 
should be instructed to seek immediate 
medical attention if they develop symptoms 
such as shortness of breath,  chest pain,  leg 
swelling,  leg pain,  persistent abdominal pain 
following vaccination. Additionally,  anyone 
with neurological symptoms including severe 
or persistent headaches,  blurred vision, 
confusion or  seizures after vaccination,  or 
who experiences spontaneous bleeding,  skin 
bruising  (petechia)  beyond the site of 
vaccination after a few days,  should seek 
prompt medical attention. 
Individuals diagnosed with thrombocytopenia 
within three weeks after vaccination with 
Vaxzevria, should be actively investigated for 
signs of thrombosis. Similarly,  individuals who 
present with thrombosis within three weeks of 
vaccination should be evaluated for 
thrombocytopenia. 
Capillary leak syndrome 
Very rare cases of capillary leak syndrome 
(CLS)  have been reported in the first days 
after vaccination with Vaxzevria.  [ ... ]

Exposure  by  doses  administered  is  used  as  part  of  Observed  versus  Expected  (O/E)  Analyses,  refer  to 
Appendix 8  of  PSUR#3 for further details. 
PRAC Rapporteur's  comment: 
As  of 30 June 2022,  a total  of ~38  million first  doses,  ~29  million  second  doses  and  ~22,000 booster 
doses have  been  administered cumulatively  in  the  EU;  and a total  of  ~2. 2  billion  doses  have  been 
administered worldwide. 
During the  reporting interval,  in  the  EU,  -198213  first doses and  -8990  second  doses  were administered. 
The  MAH explained that  the  weekly administered data is  subject  to change  every week.  The  administered 
data  for the  PBRER  reporting  interval  is  derived by subtracting  the  previous  report's cumulative  from 
current cumulative  values  (Current  Cumulative  - Previous  Cumulative  =  Current  Interval)  across all the 
countries.  Therefore,  the  negative values here  is  due to a  greater cumulative  value  from previous report 
in  comparison  to current report. 
Data per gender is  still  not available  for  EU countries.  The  MAH claimed that  since  ECDC does  not  include 
gender breakdown at country  level,  this  cannot be  provided.  However,  it commits  to continue  its  efforts 
to collect  exposure data  by country,  age,  and  gender for  all  EU countries  as  it has  been already 
requested. 
1.3.4.  Data  in  summary ta bulations 
Cumulative summary tabulations of serious  adverse events from  clinical  trials 
A  cumulative summary tabulation  of serious  adverse events  (SAEs)  from  AstraZeneca-sponsored 
interventional clinical trials  that  have  been reported during  the  Vaxzevria clinical  development 
programme,  from  the  Development  International  Birth  Date  (DIBD) to the data  lock point  (28 June 
2022),  organised  by  SOC,  is presented in Appendix 2 of  PBRER. 
Cumulative and  interval summary tabulations from  post-marketing  data sources 
Cumulative  and  interval summary tabulations  of adverse  reactions  (ie,  AEs  considered  as "a reasonable 
possibility  of a causal  relationship  between  the  medicinal  product  and  the  event" for Table 2  Appendix 2) 
that  have  been reported from  marketed experience  with  Vaxzevria,  from the  IBO  to the data  lock point, 
organised by SOC,  are presented in Appendix 2  of  PBRER. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
A cumulative total of 1,946  cases representing 4,437 serious  adverse events  have  been reported from 
AstraZeneca-sponsored interventional clinical trials.  However,  the vast majority of these  case  reports 
were  still  blinded as  they  contained  only  expected Suspected  Serious  Adverse  Reactions. 
A  cumulative  total  of 2,834,138 adverse events,  originating  from 754,981  cases,  have  been 
spontaneously reported from post-marketing  exposure,  of which 488,841  adverse  events,  from 
130,369 cases,  were  reported during  the  interval  period.  The  majority  of the  AEs  reported  during  the 
interval  and  cumulative  period were from  the  SOCs 'General  disorders and  administration  site conditions', 
'Nervous system  disorders',  'Musculoskeletal and  connective  tissue disorders'  and 'Gastrointestinal 
disorders'. 
Cumulatively,  most commonly spontaneously reported  adverse events  were  Headache,  Pyrexia,  Chills, 
Fatigue and  Myalgia.  Most commonly spontaneously reported  serious  AEs  were Headache,  Pyrexia, 
Fatigue,  Chills  and  Nausea. 
During the  period under review,  most  commonly  spontaneously reported  serious  AEs  were  COVID-19, 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  18/123 
Vaccination  failure,  Headache,  Fatigue and  Pyrexia. 
Based  on  the  number of spontaneously  reported adverse events  and  the  estimated  number of  doses 
administered  (500, 073,105  doses),  approximately  0.98  adverse  events/1, 000  doses  occurred  during  the 
period under  review,  which  is  in  line with the  previous  interval  period  (0. 6/1,000  doses).  For the  overall 
period from launch up to  the  OLP of this  PSUR,  the  occurrence  of adverse events  was  estimated  at 
l. 35/1,000  doses. 
No new important safety  information  is  identified from  the  data  in  summary  tabulations.  The distribution 
of  events  over the  different SOCs  and  the  most  commonly reported PTs are  in  line with the  known  safety 
profile  of  Vaxzevria. 
1.3.5.  Findings  from clinical trials  and other sources 
1.3.5.1.  Completed and ongoing  clinical  trials 
During the  reporting period,  one study  investigating the  safety and the  immunogenicity  of  VAXZEVRIA 
was completed  (study  D8111C00002,  Phase  1/11 study  in Japan).  A  summary  of findings  is  described  in 
Section  7 . 1  of the  PBRER. 
There were 11  (COV00l,  COV002,  COV003,  COV004,  COV005,  COV006,  COV008,  COV009, 
D8110C00001,  D8110C00010 and  D7220C00001)  ongoing  clinical trials  during  the  reporting period. 
There was  no clinically  important  information  that arose  from  ongoing clinical trials during the reporting 
period. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
The  MAH detailed  in  this  section  there  was  1  completed CT during  the  reporting period:  study 
D8111C00002,  Phase  1/11 in Japan.  A  high-level  description  of the  findings  of the  completed  trial and  7  of 
the 11  ongoing  clinical trials  is  available  in  Section  7 . 1  of the  PBRER.  Data  analyses  were  not completed 
for  the  remaining 4  ongoing  clinical trials. 
There were 11  ongoing  clinical trials  during  the  reporting  period:

�  18  years  of age.  Previously  unvaccinated  immunocompromised  adults  will  receive  3  IM  doses  of 
AZD1222.  As of 28 June 2022  there  have  been 34  participants  enrolled in  the  study. 
Findings: 
For  COV00L  COV002,  COV003 and COV005: There  was  not  a significant change in  the  safety profile 
during the reporting period. 
For  D8110C00001:  The  results  of data  analyses  performed  on  DCO3  (database  lock 02  Sept 2021)  data 
set became  available  during the reporting  period for this  PBRER.  VE estimates  were  generally  consistent 
with the  statistically  significant  result from the  primary  efficacy  analysis  using the  data  from the  05 March 
2021  data cut-off.  During  the  reporting period  immunogenicity  data became  available  showing  the  waning 
of humoral  immunogenicity  through 6  months.  These data  support  administration  of  a booster dose  of 
AZD1222  as early  as 3 months  following  primary  series vaccination.  Safety  results at  the 6-month data 
cut-off were  generally  consistent  with safety  findings  at  the  primary  analysis,  with  no new or emerging 
safety issues identified. 
For  D7220C00001:  No  emergent safety  issues  were  identified.  There  were no clinically meaningful 
differences between the safety  profiles  of  booster  doses  of AZD1222 and AZD2816.  Analyses  of data 
through to data cut-off,  up  to a maximum  of 107 days  after booster  dose,  did  not identify  any emergent 
safety issues. 
For  D8111C00002:  Ph 1/11  - Japan  - 256  participants �  18  years  of age  - 2  IM doses  of  either 
VAXZEVRIA  with  5x1010  vp  (nominal)  or  placebo administered 4  weeks  apart.  The  MAH concluded that 
AZD1222  administered  in 2  IM injections was  generally well-tolerated  and  had an  acceptable  safety 
profile  in Japanese  adult participants across all  age groups  (18  to 55  years,  56  to 69  years,  and  �  70 
years),  and the number of SAEs in  addition  to the unsolicited AEs,  was low. The MAH noted that AZD1222 
elicits strong early  immune  responses against SARS-CoV-2 in  the Japanese adult population across  all the 
age  groups;  however,  waning  of  immune  responses,  with  neutralizing  antibodies  (NAbs)  below the  lower 
limit of quantification,  was  observed  in  a large  proportion  of  participants by  Day 365. 
Overall,  based  on  review of the data  for the  completed  (1)  and  ongoing  clinical trials  (11),  no new safety 
signal was  identified during  the  reporting  period.

1.3.5.2.  Other clinical trials 
The  MAH has  identified relevant  publications whose main  results  are  summarised  by  the  PRAC assessor: 
1.  Third dosing  booster  (Munro  et  al 2021, Clemens et  al 2022, Jara et  al 2022,  Mun oz-Valle  et al 
2022). 
A  heterologous  booster dose  after  a 2-dose primary series  of  CoronaVac  (inactivated  whole-virion 
adjuvanted  vaccine),  using  Vaxzevria,  Comirnaty  or Jcovden,  elicited a significantly superior 
response  in anti-Spike IgG concentration and pseudo-neutralising titres  compared to homologous 
boosting with  CoronaVac  (Clemens,  2022). 
In  Chile,  heterologous boosting  with VAXZEVRIA,  following a two-dose CoronaVac primary vaccination 
series,  yielded vaccine  effectiveness  of 97. 7%  against  COVID-19-related hospitalisation,  98.9% 
against ICU admission,  and 98. 1 %  against  death  (Jara,  2022). 
In  Chile again,  a heterologous  booster dose  after primary  immunisation  with Convidecia  (Ad5-nCov), 
using Vaxzevria,  Jcovden,  Comirnaty,  and  Spikevax,  elicited a superior neutralising  antibodies 
response  in  the  boosted  group  versus  the  unboosted  group,  whith  no difference  between  vaccines 
(Mun oz-Valle). 
The  MAH commented that  no  additional  safety  concerns  have  been  raised  by  the  use  of  Vaxzevria in 
combination  with other  COVID-19  vaccine classes. 
2.  The persistence  of  immunogenicity  following immunization with VAXZEVRIA  (Xinxue  Liu  et  al. 
2022) 
A  third  dose  booster  of  VAXZEVRIA given after primary  immunization  with two  doses  of  BNT/BNT was 
able to  yield similar immune response  than  a homologous third dose booster of  BNT. 
Anti-Spike  antibodies  persisted for  at  least 84  days  after  primary  immunisation  with AZD1222 
followed by  a  booster with Jcovden.  The decay ratio  of  anti-Spike IgG GMT  between  Days  28 and 84 
suggested  greater persistence  of  anti-Spike  antibodies  with JCOVDEN than  with  BNT.  The  decay  rate 
of cellular responses  were  similar  between  all the vaccine  schedules  and  doses. 
The  anti-spike  IgG  in  adenoviral  vector vaccine arms (VAXZEVRIA  and  Ad26)  after the  BNT/BNT 
prime  were  the  most persistent  schedules  up  to  D84. 
3.  Real  world  evidence data  on duration of  protection  (Andrews  et al 2022a) 
Whilst VE peaked  in  the early  weeks  after administration of the  second  dose,  a decline  was  observed 
at 20  weeks  after vaccination to 44. 3%  with the VAXZEVRIA vaccine  and  to 66.3%  with the 
COMIRNATY  vaccine.  Waning  of vaccine  effectiveness  was greater in  persons 65  years  of age  or  older 
than  in  those 40  to 64  years  of age.  However,  VE against  hospitalization  remained  high at 80. 0% 
(95%  CI:  76. 8  to  82. 7) with the  VAXZEVRIA  vaccine and 91. 7%  (95%  CI:  90. 2  to 93. 0) with the 
COMIRNATY  vaccine,  and death was 84. 8%  (95%  CI:  76. 2  to 90.3) and 91. 9%  (95%  CI:  88. 5  to 
94. 3),  respectively.  The  authors  do  point  out  that  the analysis  with  VAXZEVRIA  boosters  is  to  be 
subject  to bias because  this  vaccine  was  not  recommended  as  a  booster  in  the  UK. 
4.  Real world evidence data on protection  against variants  of concern (Andrews  et al 2022b; 
Kirsebom et al 2022) 
No  effect against the  Omicron variant  was  observed  from  20  weeks  after  a  primary vaccination with 
VAXZEVRIA,  but  the  VE of a  booster  dose  with VAXZEVRIA  was  55.6%  at 2  to 4  weeks  and 46. 7%  at 
5  to 9  weeks following  booster  administration.  This  decrease  in  VE was  also noted with  a third 
homologous  dose  of  BNT  and  mRNA-1273. 
PRAC  PSUR assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  21/123 
In another study  conducted  in  England,  a test-negative  case  control  design  was  used  to  estimate  the 
VE of a  VAXZEVRIA  or COMIRNATY  booster  following a  primary  series  of  VAXZEVRIA  against 
symptomatic  disease and hospitalisation  in  Omicron era.  In those  aged 40-64  years,  VE against 
symptomatic  disease  increased  to 61. 2%  (40. 9  to 74. 6% )  one  week after  receiving  a booster with 
VAXZEVRIA  as compared to 58. 2%  (57  to 59.4%) amongst  those  who received  a COMIRNATY 
booster.  Waning  of  protection  was  described  for  both,  VAXZEVRIA  and  COMIRNATY  third dose 
boosters.  Protection  against  symptomatic  disease  in  those  aged 65  years and older  peaked at 
66.1%  (16. 6  to 86. 3%) and 68.5%  (65. 7  to 71. 2%) among those  who  received  VAXZEVRIA and 
COMIRNATY  boosters,  respectively,  and  waned  to 44. 5%  (22. 4 to 60. 2%) and 54. 1%(50. 5  to 
57.5%),  respectively,  after  5  to 9  weeks. 
VE against  hospitalisation  following  infection  with the SARS-CoV-2  Omicron variant  peaked  at  82. 3% 
(64. 2  to 91. 3% ) after an  VAXZEVRIA booster and  90.9%  after  a third dose booster with (88. 7  to 
92. 7% )  booster. 
MAH's  conclusion:  No information  relevant  to the  benefit risk assessment  of  VAXZEVRIA  was  identified 
from  any  other clinical trial  or  study  sources,  during  the  reporting  period. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
The  MAH identified other studies from the  literature. 
These  studies did not  bring  new important  information  on  the  safety  of  Vaxzevria. 
New information  was about: 
- The use  of Vaxzevria as  an  heterologous booster (3
rd 
dose):  immunologic  and  vaccine  effectiveness 
data  support  the  use  of  Vaxzevria  as heterologous  booster  after  primary vaccination with various  other 
COVID-19  vaccines.  Yet,  these  findings should  be  further  explored  in  the  Omicron era. 
- Waning  of the  immune  response after primary vaccination  and booster is observed for  Vaxzevria  and 
other vaccines.  Effectiveness  against  hospitalisation  and  death is  longer sustained  than  effectiveness 
against  infection. 
1.3.5.3.  Vaccination errors 
Please note  that  Vaccination errors data is not reproduced here  (see Section 9.2 and Appendix  1 1  of 
PBRER) 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
Interval review:  A total of 7728 case reports,  including 8104  vaccination  error AEs  have  been  identified 
during  the  reporting  period.  This  is  comparable  to 7805  case  reports and 8434  vaccination error  AEs  as 
reported during the  previous  reporting interval.  The  most frequently reported AEs belong to the SOC 
General  disorders and  administration site conditions  (2197  interval AEs).  Interval case reports 
represent  42.54%  of cumulative cases  (18164). 
Of the 7728  case  reports,  560 were reported  as  serious  (169  case  reports  were medically confirmed  and 
391  were consumer  reports).  In 5788  (75% )  cases  no  associated  AEs  were reported  in  connection  with 
the vaccination  error.  Other AEs  were co-reported  in  the  remaining 1940 (25%) case  reports,  of which 
523  (27%) cases  were  serious  including 27 case  reports  with a fatal  outcome. 
Cumulative  review:  A  total  of 18164  case  reports,  including 19593  vaccination  error AEs,  have  been 
identified during the cumulative period.  Of those 18164 case  reports,  1644 were  considered  serious  (429 
case  reports  were  medically confirmed and  1215  were  consumer reports).  In 13075  (72% )  cases  no other 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  22/123 
AEs were  reported  in  connection  with the  vaccination  error.  Other AEs  were co-reported  in  the  remaining 
5089  (28% ) case  reports,  of which 1559  (31 % )  cases were serious,  including 58  case  reports  with a fatal 
outcome. 
Notably, there were 27 case reports  with  fatal outcome  during  reporting  interval  which  is 13% 
less than 27  fatal case reports as reported in previous PSUR#2. 
As requested the  MAH presented all  fatal cases associated with vaccination error in details. 
A  cumulative  review of vaccination  error case  reports with fatal  outcome  is  provided  in Appendix 11  of 
PSUR#3.  Interchange  of vaccine  products  (n=21) and Incorrect route  of  product  administration  (n= 14) 
were the  most  frequently  reported  vaccination  error events.  Most  of the  reports  with incorrect  route  of 
administration  (intravenous,  subcutaneous)  were  consumer reports  and  there  was  limited information  on 
the  actual  medication error. 
Most frequently reported AEs  (� 3)  were :  Headache (7);  Pyrexia (6);  Cardiac  arrest  (6);  Dyspnoea (6); 
Death (5);  Cerebrovascular  accident  (5);  Myalgia (4);  Vomiting  (4);  Nausea  (4);  Dizziness  (4);  Loss  of 
consciousness  (4);  Arthralgia  (4);  Myocardial  infarction  (4);  Hypoaesthesia  (4);  Paraesthesia  (4); 
Asthenia  (4);  Pain  (3);  Thrombosis  (3);  Immobile  (3);  Confusional  state  (3);  Malaise  (3);  COVID-19  (3); 
Exposure  during  pregnancy  (3);  and Hemiplegia (3). 
Reported  causes  of  death in  these  cases  were  Dyspnoea  (3),  Death  (2),  Thrombosis  (2),  Multiple  organ 
dysfunction  syndrome  (1),  Abortion spontaneous  (1),  Pulmonary  embolism  (1),  Confusional  state  (1), 
Loss of consciousness  (1),  Coronary artery occlusion (1),  Nausea  (1),  Coronary  artery  thrombosis  (1), 
Rash (1),  COVID-19  (1),  Cerebral thrombosis (1),  Cardiac arrest  (1),  Dementia Alzheimer' s  type  (1), 
Myocardial infarction  (1),  Diarrhoea  (1),  Skin discolouration  (1),  Pyrexia (1),  Asthenia  (1),  Circulatory 
collapse  (1),  Vein rupture  (1),  Urosepsis  (1),  Haemorrhage  intracranial  (1),  Vomiting  (1),  Headache  (1) 
and Hypersensitivity (1). 
The  MAH concluded that the review of these fatal  cases did  not  identify safety  issues  in 
relation to  type of vaccination errors. 
In conclusion,  some  medication errors  are expected to occur  despite written instructions and 
educational  activities  for HCPs  administering  the  vaccine.  The  number of cases,  the  type  and  seriousness 
of the reported  medication  errors  are  comparable  to the  previous  PSUR#2.  These cases  do not  indicate 
any  trends  of systemic  substantial  errors  or  a  need  for  additional  risk  mitigation  activity. 
The  MAH's  conclusion  is  accepted  that  at  the  moment  no new relevant patterns  of  (potential)  vaccination 
errors were  identified. 
1.3.5.4.  literature 
Relevant literature  articles  containing  new and significant  safety  findings  relevant to  COVID 19  VACCINE 
ASTRAZENECA  published during the  review period were retrieved.  Articles  of interest related to event 
reviews completed as part of Health Authority  requests,  Important identified and  Potential risks  or Missing 
information  have  been  included within  the  review of those  safety concerns throughout section 2. 3. 
Literature articles  from  clinical/observational/real  world  studies  on  vaccine  effectiveness  and  booster  dose 
are summarized  in  Section 1. 3. 5. 2. 
Other  articles  containing  new and  significant  safety  findings  are  summarized below. 
Vaccine-related cutaneous manifestations :  Avallone  et al 2022  conducted  a systematic review of 
229  articles  according  to the  PRISMA  guidelines with the  objective  to  provide  an  extensive  overview of all 
the vaccine-related cutaneous manifestations  reported  in  the literature  thus  far.  A  search on MEDLINE, 
PRAC PSUR assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  23/123 
PubMed,  Scopus,  and Cochrane  Library  was  conducted  using the  combination  of the  following  keywords 
and medical subject heading  (MeSH)  terms:  COVID  vaccine,  dermatology,  rash,  skin,  cutaneous,  BNT162, 
COMIRNATY,  AstraZeneca,  and mRNA-1273.  The time range  of our search was  from  01  March 2020  to 
04  November 2021. 
Results:  A  total  of 229 articles with  data  from 4649 patients with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine-related 
dermatological  manifestations  were  included  in  the  analysis.  A  total  of 5941  SARS-CoV-2  vaccine-related 
dermatological  manifestations  were  gathered.  Local  injection-site  reactions  were  the  most  frequently 
observed,  followed  by  rash/unspecified cutaneous eruption,  urticaria!  rashes,  angioedema,  herpes  zoster, 
morbilliform/maculopapular/erythematous  macular eruption,  pityriasis  rosea and  pityriasis  rosea-like 
eruptions,  and  other less common dermatological manifestations.  Flares  of  pre-existing  dermatological 
conditions  were  also reported.  Rash/Unspecified  cutaneous  eruption  was  the  most  common 
dermatological  manifestation  reported for AstraZeneca vaccine. 
Overall  conclusion  as per  author:  Cutaneous adverse reactions  following SARS-CoV-2 vaccine 
administration  seem to be  heterogeneous,  rather  infrequent,  and  not  life-threatening.  Vaccinated  patients 
should  be  monitored for  skin manifestations,  and dermatological evaluation  should be  offered,  when 
needed. 
AstraZeneca comment: Cutaneous adverse events such as  rash  and urticaria and injections site  reactions 
are listed in  the  VAXZEVRIA  CDS.  Cutaneous  reactions  are the  most  common  form  of ADRs,  occurring  in 
2% -3%  of inpatient  and  in  approximately 2%  of outpatient  patients  in  general population.  Also,  a large 
majority  of cutaneous  reactions  post  vaccination  were mild and  self-limiting,  and  public health  benefit  of 
vaccination  is  considered  to outweigh the  rare  occurrence  of these  events. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
The  data  from Avallone et  al.  2022  do not  raise  any  new safety concern. 
1.3.6.  Lack  of  efficacy in controlled  clinical trials 
Study  D8111C00002  is  already discussed  in Error!  Reference source not  found.The  study  assessed 
the  safety and  immunogenicity  of  VAXZEVRIA  in 256  participants  in Japan  across  all  age  groups. 
Expected  waning  in humoral responses  against  SARS-CoV-2  was  observed  over the  course  of the  one­
year follow up;  however,  total  spike and  RBD  mean  antibody  titres  remained elevated  above  Day 15 
levels. 
Recent publications support the thesis that VAXZEVRIA confers good  VE against symptomatic COVID-19 
resulting  from  infection  with  the  Omicron variant  and  it  is  particularly effective  in  preventing severe 
disease,  hospitalizations and death. 
No  other data  regarding  lack  of efficacy  that  would constitute a significant risk to the  treated  population 
were  received  during the  reporting  period. 
Immunogenicty  data  on Omicron variant of concern 
Researchers  at  the  University  of  Oxford have assessed  neutralization  of the  emerging  Omicron sub­
lineages  BA.4  and  BA. 5  (in  addition  to  BA.2) by  serum  from  individuals  vaccinated  with 3  doses  of 
VAXZEVRIA  or  COMIRNATY  (Tuekprakhon  et al 2022).  Assays were performed using serum obtained 28 
days following the 3rd dose.  While BA.4/5 showed  reduced  neutralization  compared with BA. 1 and BA. 2, 
the reductions were modest.  For  VAXZEVRIA,  neutralization titers  for  BA.4/5  were reduced 2. 1-fold 
compared with  BA. 1  (p < 0. 0001)  and 1. 8-fold compared with  BA.2 (p  < 0. 0001).  For COMIRNATY, 
neutralization  titers  were  reduced 3. 1-fold (p  < 0. 0001)  and 3. 1-fold (p  < 0. 0001)  compared with  BA.1 
PRAC PSUR assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  24/123 
and BA.2,  respectively.  The authors  concluded  that although these  reductions  in  titers  may reduce  the 
effectiveness  of the  vaccines  at  preventing  infection,  it  would be  expected  that  protection would  remain 
against  severe  disease. 
CDS+  T cell  responses  are  thought  to be  particularly  important  for the  prevention  of  severe  disease.  T cell 
Receptors  (TCR)  sequencing  analysis  has  identified that  the  immunodominant region  of Spike recognised 
by  CDS+  T cells (Swanson et al 2021)  is  not impacted  by  the  Spike  mutations  present  in  the  Omicron 
variant  (including BA. 4/BA. 5  sublineages).  T cell data are now  available  from  the  ongoing AstraZeneca­
sponsored  study  D7220C00001,  in  which participants received a 3rd  booster  dose  of  VAXZEVRIA  after  a 
primary series  of  VAXZEVRIA  or an  mRNA vaccine.  Analysis  of spike  peptide T-cell responses  at  Day 14 
after a 3rd booster dose  of  VAXZEVRIA showed  similar  levels  of  CD4+  and CDS+  T cells  against  the 
ancestral  SARS-CoV-2  strain  or the  Omicron  variant.  These  data  support  the  conclusion  that  protection 
would remain  against  severe  disease  caused  by  Omicron  variant sub-lineages. 
MAH's Conclusion:  Real-world evidence  has  since supported the  effectiveness  of  VAXZEVRIA  in 
preventing infection,  particularly  severe  infection  leading to hospitalisation,  by  the  Omicron  variant. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
This chapter does  not bring new important safety  information. 
Results  from  study  D8111C00002  confirms  waning of humoral response  over a  one-year follow-up  period. 
Tuekprakhon et al found modest reduced  neutralisation  for  BA. 4/5  than  for  BA.1 and  BA. 2  after three 
dose vaccination with Vaxzevria  or  Comirnaty.  However,  the authors concluded  that  protection should 
remain against  severe  disease. 
The  protection against severe  forms  of the diseases  is also supported by  findings  from study 
D7220C00001  which showed  similar levels  of  CD4+  and CDS+  against  the ancestral SARS-COV-2 strain 
and the  Omicron variant. 
1.3.7.  Late- breaking information 
After the data  lock  point  of the  PBRER  (28 June 2022),  VAXZEVRIA  CDS was  updated  on  01 July 2022 
(CDS Version 19. 0) and 2  signals  were  validated. 
CDS  Update 
VAXZEVRIA  CDS was  updated  to include Tinnitus  as an  ADR Section 4. 8  with frequency  of uncommon. 
Signal  Evaluation 
Immune  thrombocytopenia  (ITP):  The  signal for  ITP  was  re-opened  based  on  well-documented  case 
reports  from  the  published  literature.  AstraZeneca  internally  validated  the  signal  on 06 July 2022 and  the 
topic is currently  undergoing  evaluation as per AstraZeneca's  signal  detection  and  evaluation  processes. 
Conclusions  and  any  recommended  actions  for this  signal will  be communicated  in  the  next  PBRER,  or 
earlier as  necessary. 
Cutaneous Vasculitis  (CV):  The  signal for  CV  was  identified  based  on well-documented case  series 
from  published literature  cases.  Subsequently  a request  on  the  same  topic  was  received from  PRAC  PSUR 
assessment report.  AstraZeneca  internally  validated  the  signal  on 15 July 2022. 
On 18 August 2022,  upon  further evaluation  of this  topic AstraZeneca considered  that  there  is a 
reasonable  possibility  of causal  relationship  between VAXZEVRIA  and  Cutaneous  vasculitis.  CDS Section 
4. 8  is  in  the progress  to  be  updated  to include  cutaneous  vasculitis  as  an ADR (frequency:  not  known). 
PRAC  PSUR assessment  report

Literature:  An AstraZeneca co-authored article  (Error!  Reference  source not  found.)  regarding the 
risk of thrombosis with  thrombocytopenia  was  published  on-line  on 19 August 2022.  This  article  presents 
a  review  of  ICSR case characteristics  reported  to  AstraZeneca  through to 28  December  2021.  This  article 
includes  data  and  analyses already  included  in  previous  PBRERs/monthly  summary  reports,  as  well as  in 
the cumulative  review presented in  section Error!  Reference source  not  found.of  this  PBRER,  and 
therefore  presents  no  new,  additional  evidence.  The  article  does  not change  the  characterisation  of this 
risk. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
CDS update for tinnitus: Tinnitus  was  included  in  the  section 4. 8  of the  EU-Sm PC  as  an  outcome  of the 
previous  PSUR  assessment  report.  Please  refer to section 1. 3. 2.  for further  details. 
Signal  of  ITP:  ITP  is  a  listed  as  an  ADR  in  the  EU-PI  and  included  in  the  important  identified  risks  in  the 
EU-RMP.  Up  to date,  ITP  was  not recognised  as  an  ADR  nor an  important  identified  risk  by  the  MAH. 
Please  refer to  section  2. 3.2.  for further  details. 
Signal  of cutaneous  vasculitis:  the MAH  proposes  to include  cutaneous  vasculitis  in  the  section 4. 8  of the 
SmPC based  on  the evaluation of available data.  Please  refer to section 2.3. 34.  for further details. 
Literature  for TTS:  the  MAH co-published  a review of TTS  cases  which  have  been reported to  him.  The 
data  are  in  line  with  the  current  state  of  knowledge  regarding  the  risk  of TTS. 
Signal  of corneal  graft  rejection:  on  O 1  September  2022,  PRAC  finalised  its  review  of corneal graft 
rejection with  Vaxzevria.  It concluded  that  the  available  evidence does  not support  a causal  relationship 
between Vaxzevria and CGR. 
Signal  of pemphigus  and  pemphigoid:  on  04  October 2022,  EMA  validated  a signal  of  pemphigus  and 
°
pemphigoid  (EPITT  n
19858).  The  confirmation  of the signal is  currently  ongoing. 
Potential  signal  of SCAR:  after  the  OLP  of the  PSUR,  WHO-UMC  identified  1  signal  of SCAR with COVID-19 
vaccines.  The  MAH is  requested to  provide  a cumulative review of cases reported with 
Vaxzevria,  as well as a review of the literature. A discussion on the  need to update the  PI 
should be  included.

Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
The signals of 'GBS',  'Hypoaesthesia and  Paraesthesia',  and 'Tinnitus' were closed  by  the  MAH and 
are discussed below. 
During the  reporting period,  1  other signal was  assessed  by  EMA: 
- EMA  validated  a signal  of Glomerulonephritis  and  nephrotic  syndrome  (EPITT 19805).  The  PRAC 
Rapporteur did not confirm the signal  (6  May 2022) but  requested further  discussion  for the  current 
PBRER  under  review  (See  Section 2. 3. 27  on Health Authority  requests) 
After the  O LP  of this  PBRER, 
- The  MAH re-open  the  signal  of  ITP  (see Section 1. 3. 7 for further  details).  Of note,  Immune 
thrombocytopenia  is  described  in  the  EU-PI  (sections 4. 4  and 4. 8).  Thrombocytopenia,  including 
immune thrombocytopenia is an  important  identified risk in  the  EU-RMP. 
- The  MAH validated a signal  of  Cutaneous  vasculitis  (see Section 1. 3. 7  for further details) and 
received a similar request from  PRAC during previous PBRER assessment.  Based  on  its  assessment, 
the  MAH  is  proposing to  include  cutaneous  vasculitis  in  section 4. 8.  This  signal  is  further discussed  in 
Section 2. 3. 34. 
- PRAC  assessed  and  closed  a signal  of  Corneal Graft Rejection.  No update of  the  PI  or  RMP  was 
requested.  The  topic should  be  monitored under routine  pharmacovigilance  (EPITT  19791,  PRAC 
recommendation  on 01 Sep 2022) 
- EMA validated a signal  of Histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis  (EPITT  19837,  not confirmed  on 17 Jul 
2022).  The  PRAC  Rapporteur  did  not confirm the  signal  based  on  the  low number  of cases  [ < 3]  and 
absence  of  disproportionality  [ROR< 1]. 
2.2.1.  Closed  and  rej ected/refuted  signals 
There were  no closed and  rejected/refuted  signals  during  the  reporting  period. 
2.2.2.  Closed  signals  categorised  as  important  potential  risks 
There was  one  closed  signal,  Guillain-Barre  syndrome (GBS),  that  was  categorized  as  Important potential 
risk during  the  reporting  period. 
Guillain-Barre  syndrome 
Method(s)  of evaluation:  Comprehensive  cumulative  review of clinical and  post-marketing reports  and 
the literature  (including  case  reviews  and  epidemiological  studies)  of GBS  [MedDRA  SMQ  narrow Guillain­
Barre  syndrome].  Medical review according to  Brighton  collaboration  and  causality  assessment according 
to WHO-UMC causality  criteria.  Quantitative  Signal  Detection System  (Observed  versus  expected 
analysis),  stratified by  age,  gender,  dose  and  using  different risk windows  with incidence  rates  from 
ACCESS  protocol. 
Outcome  of the evaluation:  AstraZeneca clarified  the  existing  language on  demyelinating 
disorders  in Section 4.4 of  CDS  with  inclusion  of GBS specifically.  In line  with this,  the  relevant 
text on GBS was  added  to the  CPIL.  AstraZeneca  believes that  this may  help the vaccinees seek early 
medical care  irrespective of the underlying  aetiology of GBS. 
MAH's Conclusions:  Although AstraZeneca' s  position  is  that a reasonable  possibility of a causal 
association does  not exist between VAXZEVRIA and GBS  at  this  time,  AstraZeneca acknowledges 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  29/123 
the 1432  case  reports  in  our Safety  database,  the  published evidence,  and  the  increased  O/E ratio in 
some categories amidst the  complexities  including the  role  of  COVID  19  possibly causing GBS in  the 
background.  However,  the  available  data  on GBS  is mainly from  spontaneously  reported  cases,  which are 
voluntary  and  often  have  limited  information  or have  predisposing /  confounding  factors  for GBS.  Four (4) 
out  of 1432  cases were considered "Probable"  according WHO-UMC  criteria,  despite  having  some  missing 
information  as  explained  above.  The  incidence  rates  that  are  used  for the  O/E analyses  are conservative, 
as  other reliable  sources  have  higher rates.  In  addition,  the  rates are since  pre-pandemic times  and  not 
accounting for the COVID-19  pandemic  in  the  background. 
Although there  are  epidemiological  articles  describing a temporal association  to the first  dose  of 
VAXZEVRIA,  the  risk was  approximately 4  times  greater  after  a  COVID-19  infection.  Therefore,  there  are 
still  gaps  in  understanding  on  the  incidence  rate  of GBS in  the context  of the  effect  of  COVID-19 
pandemic  in  the  background. 
Taking this  into  consideration,  AstraZeneca will continue  to closely  monitor GBS as part  of our 
surveillance activities  and  take  further  actions as deemed necessary. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
Data  on  GBS were  thoroughly assessed in several MSSRs  and  in previous PSURs.  GBS is currently listed 
in  section 4. 8  of the  EU-Sm PC  and  a warning  is  included  in  section 4.4.  GBS is an  important  identified risk 
of  Vaxzevria,  included  in  the  EU-RMP (see  Sections 2.3. 3  and 2. 4  for further details). 
During the  period  of this  PBRER,  the  MAH closed a signal  of GBS  based on  a cumulative  review of  post­
marketing,  clinical and  literature data.  The  cumulative  review  presented  in Appendix 20  of the  PBRER 
[O LP of 28. 12. 2021] did not  provide additional information  compared to  the  data discussed in the 
previous PBRER  [same  O LP],  except a few new articles: 
•  Kaulen  et al. 2022  identified 8 cases  of neurological autoimmune  conditions  in  temporal  association 
with the  first  dose  of  Vaxzevria through a single-centre  prospective  case  study.  These cases  included 
2  cases  of GBS which were treated  with IVIG,  resulting  in  a favourable outcome. 
• 
Li et al. 2022  performed  a population based  historical  rate comparison study and  a self-controlled 
case  series  analysis  in  UK and Spain.  The  study  sample  comprised  ~8,3  million  people who received 
at  least 1  dose  of  COVID-29  vaccines  (including  ~4,4 millions  of  Vaxzevria  vaccinees)  and  ~0,74 
million of unvaccinated  individuals.  No signal was observed between COVID-19 vaccines and the 
events of Bell's palsy,  encephalomyelitis  and GBS.  However,  infection  with SARS-CoV-2  was 
associated  with an  increased  risk of these  events. 
For  example  in  the  data  from  UK (cohort analysis),  the  standardised  incidence  ratio for GBS was 
t 
estimated  to 0. 74  (0.41 to 1. 33)  after  a  p
dose  of Vaxzevria and to 3. 53  (1.83 to 6.77) after  a 
SARS-CoV-2  positive  test.  The SCCS was  not performed for GBS  because  of limited statistical  power. 
Of note,  these  results  are  not in  line with data  from  previously  published  epidemiological studies.  In 
particular,  the  more robust SCCS study from  Patane  et  al.  (2021) included more than 20  million 
people vaccinated with Vaxzevria and  showed  an  increased risk of GBS,  with an  IRR  [1-28d]  of 2. 04 
[95%CI 1. 60-2.60]. 
In conclusion,  available data did  not change the  current  knowledge  regarding GBS after Vaxzevria. 
The  PRAC  Rapporteur does  not agree  with the  MAH's conclusion  that  a reasonable  possibility  of a causal 
association  does  not exist  between  VAXZEVRIA and GBS at  this  time. 
However,  as  GBS is  appropriately described  in  the  EU-PI  (sections 4. 4 and 4. 8)  and  in  the  EU-RMP 
(important identified risk),  no further action is  required.

2.2.3.  Closed  signals  categorised  as  important  identified  risks 
There  were  no closed signals  categorised  as  important  identified risks during  the  reporting  period. 
2.2.4.  Closed  signals  that  are  potential risks not categorised  as  important 
There were  no closed signals that are potential risks not categorised as important during the  reporting 
period. 
2.2.5.  Closed signals that  are  identified risks not categorised as  important 
There were two  signals (Hypoaesthesia and Paraesthesia,  and Tinnitus)  that  were closed during  or  shortly 
after the  reporting interval. 
Hypoaesthesia and  Paraesthesia 
Method(s)  of evaluation:  Comprehensive  cumulative  review of clinical and  post-marketing reports  and 
the literature  (including  case  reviews  and  epidemiological  studies)  of hypoaesthesia  and  paraesthesia 
[MedDRA  PTs:  Hypoaesthesia;  Paraesthesia].  Quantitative  data  review using the  reporting  odds  ratio 
(ROR)  from  EVDAS data. 
Outcome of the evaluation:  VAXZEVRIA  CDS Section 4. 8  (undesirable effects)  updated  with 
'Hypoaesthesia'  and 'Paraesthesia' 
MAH's Conclusions:  Based  on  the  evaluation  of currently  available  information  from  all  available 
sources,  with particular focus  on  post-market data,  AstraZeneca considers  that there is  a reasonable 
possibility of a causal  association between VAXZEVRIA  and hypoaesthesia and  paraesthesia. 
Many of these  events  were co-reported with reactogenicity events.  The  information  regarding 
hypoaesthesia and  paraesthesia will  be added to  the  CDS and  the company  will continue  to conduct 
routine  pharmacovigilance  activities  on  this  safety  topic. 
Tinnitus 
Method(s)  of evaluation:  Comprehensive  cumulative  review of clinical and post-marketing reports  and 
the literature  (including  case  reviews  and  epidemiological  studies)  of  tinnitus  [MedDRA  PT: Tinnitus]. 
Medical review and causality  assessment according  to WHO-UMC causality criteria for medically confirmed 
cases.  Quantitative  Signal  Detection System using  EVDAS  data and  observed  versus  expected analysis), 
stratified  by age  and  risk window 0-42 days,  with incidence  rates  from  Stohler et al 2019. 
Outcome of the evaluation:  Update  to include  "Tinnitus"  in  section 4. 8  in  VAXZEVRIA CDS with 
frequency  "uncommon"  based  on  clinical trial  data  and  section 4  of  PIL 
MAH's  Conclusions:  Based on the evaluation  of currently  available  information from various  sources, 
AstraZeneca considers  that there  is  a reasonable  possibility of a causal  association between 
VAXZEVRIA  and tinnitus.  VAXZEVRIA CDS Section 4. 8  (undesirable  effects)  was  updated  (post  O LP)  to 
include  'Tinnitus'.  When  used in accordance with the  revised prescribing information,  the  benefits  of 
VAXZEVRIA  continue to outweigh the  risks. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
Both signals of "Paraesthesia and  hypoaesthesia" and "Tinnitus" were assessed in  the  context  of the 
previous PSUR procedure which led to the inclusion of the 3 events in  the section 4. 8  of the  EU-Sm PC 
(i. e.  Paraesthesia  [uncommon],  Hypoaesthesia  [uncommon],  and Tinnitus  [uncommon].

2.3.  Evaluation  of  risks  and  safety topics under  monitoring 
2.3.1.  Important  Identified  Risk - Thrombosis  in combination with 
thrombocytopenia/Thrombosis  with  thrombocytopenia  syndrome 
Please note  that  TTS  data  is not  reproduced  here  (Section  1 6. 3. 2 . 1   and  1 5.2. 1 5  (Request  from Health 
Canada) of the PBRER). 
MAH's Summary 
The highest  number of cases  were  reported  from  UK  (55%) while  receiving 49. 02  million  doses  of the 
total worldwide  doses. 
The  analysis  of thrombosis  in  combination  with  thrombocytopenia  following the  second dose  of 
VAXZEVRIA  showed  that  the  rate  of events  was  extremely  low and  lower than  after  administration  of the 
first  dose.  The  majority  of the  vaccinees  who experienced TTS events  post  Dose  2  were  male  (59%  vs 
42%)  and  were  older (Median  age  was 65. 5  years  vs.  45  years) compared to first dose  recipients.  The 
median  time to  onset  of second  dose  cases  was  14  days  compared  to 12 days  for the cases  with first 
dose. 
Overall,  the  most common  events  were Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis,  Deep  vein  thrombosis, 
Pulmonary  embolism,  and Thrombosis. 
The time to onset  was  available  for all  doses  in  78%  (1875/2391)  of cases;  TTO was  reported  in  77% 
(1637/ 2123) for Dose 1 and 89%  (232/ 260) for Dose 2.  Overall,  there were more fatal  reports for TTO 
within 14  and 21  days.  Seventy-three  (73% )  percent  of  the  fatal  reports  occurred  with 14  days  compare 
to 64%  for  all cases and 87%  of the  fatal  report  occurred  with 21  days  compare  to 80%  for  all cases. 
The highest  fatality  rate  for all  dosage  in  female vaccinees  was  28/117  (24% )  in 18 to 29  years  of age 
and male  vaccinees  was  21/93  (23% )  in 30  to 39  years  of age.  The  fatality  rate  in  female  vaccinees  in 
Dose 1  found  28/111  (25% )  in 18-29  years,  whereas in  male vaccinees  it  was  16/72  (22% )  in 18 to 29 
years  of age  and  21/92  (22% )  in 30  to  39  years.  The fatality rate  in  Dose  2  found  in  females  was  2/27 
(33% )  in 60  to 69  years  of age  and  in  males  7/45  (15% )  in  70 to 79  years age group. 
No new or emerging concern regarding TTS post-booster has  been  identified with booster  doses  of 
VAXZEVRIA. 
The highest  number of fatal  reports  (28% )  occurred  due  to HLT  of  Cerebrovascular venous  and  sinus 
thrombosis.  Cerebral haemorrhage  was  the  most common  bleeding  event associated  with fatal  event.  The 
total number and  percent  of fatal reports  since  April 2021  are decreasing compared to January 2021  to 
March 2021.  There  is  an increased fatality  rate  in  December 2021;  however,  only 25  cases were reported 
in  this  month received which could explain the sharp increase in  the percentages.  There  is an  increased 
fatality rate  in April 2022  (9  reported fatal  events out of 31  reports)  compared  to the  earlier months 
December 2021 and March 2021.  Number and  percent  of fatal reports  since  April 2021  has  decreased 
compared to January  to March 2021 and percent  of fatal  reports decreased  from May 2022  to June 2022. 
The  arterial  events  were reported highest  in  the  age  groups  of 50  to  59  and 60  to 69  years.  The 
distribution  of  events  in  male  and  female  was  roughly equal.  The  mixed or the  combined  arterial  and 
venous  events  were equally  distributed  in  age  groups of 30  to 39,  40  to 49,  50  to 59  and 60  to 69  years, 
and the distribution  of cases  in  female  and male was  roughly  equal.  The  venous  events  were  reported 
highest  in  the  age  groups  of 40  to 49,  50  to 59,  and 60  to 69  years;  the  occurrence  in  females  was  higher 
than  in  males. 
The  most  common confounding factors  in descending order of frequency  in  all 2391  cases  were 
PRAC  PSUR assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  32/123 
autoimmune  conditions,  malignancy,  history  of heparin,  obesity,  and  concomitant  use  of contraceptives. 
The  most  common confounding factors  in  the  confirmed reports  were  history  of heparin  use and 
malignancy.  The dates  of heparin  administered  were not reported  in  all cases. 
MAH's  conclusion 
Based  on  currently  available  data,  no new safety  information concerning TTS was  identified.  The current 
risk  minimisation  measures  described  in  the  product  information  are  considered adequate. 
From the data  identified  during  the  reporting period and  also  taking  into account  the  cumulative 
experience,  no updates to the  VAXZEVRIA CDS or RMP are warranted at  this  time. 
Thrombosis  in combination  with thrombocytopenia/TTS  is  contained  in  Section 4. 4  (Special warnings  and 
special  precautions  for use)  and 4. 8  in  the  VAXZEVRIA  CDS.  In addition,  VAXZEVRIA  is  contraindicated 
(CDS  Section 4.3) for use  in  any  persons who have  experienced  thrombosis  in  combination  with 
thrombocytopenia with any COVID-19  vaccine.  Finally,  thrombosis  in  combination with thrombocytopenia/ 
TTS is  listed as  an  Important  Identified Risk in  the Core  and  EU  RMPs for  VAXZEVRIA.  As  such,  the topic 
will  continue  to  be  kept under close  safety  surveillance  by  AstraZeneca  and  further actions  will  be  taken 
as  deemed  appropriate. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
Cumulatively,  up  to 28 June 2022,  2391 cases  of thrombosis  in combination with thrombocytopenia  (TCP) 
have been reported,  of which 260 cases were reported after the  2
dose  and 6 cases after the  3
dose. 
nd 
rd 
During the  current  reporting interval,  447  cases  (255 initial,  192  follow-up)  were  received. 
Cumulatively,  the  majority  of the cases were reported in  the  UK (55% ).  Median age  (56  years),  median 
time to onset  (12 days) and  gender distribution  (53%  females)  were  similar to the  previous  PBRER 
(PBRER02).  Overall,  80%  of the cases occurred within 21  days  after  vaccination. 
Location  of  thrombotic  events:  Most  frequently  reported  PTs were  similar  to  PBRER02:  Pulmonary 
embolism  (n= 843),  DVT (n= 506),  Thrombosis  (n= 488),  CVST (n=463),  Thrombosis  with 
thrombocytopenia  syndrome  (n=345)  and  Portal  vein  thrombosis  (n= 185). 
Reporting  rates  for TTS,  in  the  UK and  EEA  (Table 196 and 197  of the  PBRER):  Overall  EEA TTS 
reporting  rate  with risk window of 42 days  was  estimated  at  14. 01/million  doses  (7. 19/million  when 
considering confirmed,  probable and  possible  cases).  Reporting rate  in  EEA  was  highest post  dose 1,  in 
individuals  < 60  years  (~35  cases/million  doses;  all cases).  EEA TTS reporting rate (42d risk window) 
following  dose 1  (25.41/million)  was  clearly  higher than following dose 2  (1.44/million).  These  estimates 
were  in  line with  UK reporting rates  following  dose  1  (21. 72/million)  and post-dose 2  (3. 98/million). 
The  MAH provided observed versus expected  (O/E)  analyses  for TTS and  for CVST with TCP,  with 
results  in  line with  PBRER02. 
The  MAH applied the  MHRA Case Classification  for TTS  to all cases:  1561  (65% )  cases  were  categorized 
as  confirmed/probable/possible  (14%  = confirmed,  16%  =  probable  and 35%  =  possible),  the remaining 
34%  of the  cases did not  meet the criteria and 1  case was  considered unlikely.  There  was  no  difference  in 
the case  categorization  criteria  between  dose  1,  dose 2,  and  fatal  case  reports.  Of the  Dose 2  cases 
(n= 260),  only 5%  met the  confirmed criteria,  18%  the  probable  criteria,  47%  the  possible  criteria and 
28%  were  categorized  as  criteria not  met. 
The  MAH also applied the CDC working case  definition for TTS  to all 2391  cases:  699  (29% )  of the  cases 
met the CDC criteria  of TTS  (26%  =  Tier 1 TTS  case,  3%  =  Tier 2 TTS  case).  In  response  to the  Request 
from  Health  Canada  (section 15. 2. 15),  the  MAH noted  that  as  the MHRA  case  definition results  in  a larger 
number  of cases  being at  least possible  cases  compared to  the  CDC definition,  this  is  considered  to  be  the 
PRAC  PSUR assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  33/123 
most conservative  and suitable definition to  use  in  this  context. 
Fatal  cases:  414  of the 2391 TTS cases  had a fatal  outcome  (case  fatality  rate  (CFR)  of 17%  =  CFR of 
PBRER02).  The  CFR was  highest  within  individuals  < 40  years  of age  (23%).  Overall  CFR for TTS has 
decreased  since  the  start  of the  signal  (14%  in April 2021  compared to 23-36%  in January-March  2021). 
There was  an  increased  fatality  rate  from  December 2021  (28% )  to  April 2022  (29% )  compared to the 
earlier  months,  however  the  absolute  number of fatal  reports  was  low in  this  period  (7-11  fatal  reports, 
25-43  total  cases)  and CFR decreased again  in  May 2022  (17%) and June 2022  (18%). 
TTS after Dose 2:  Up  to 28 June 2022, 260 cases of TTS  following the second dose were retrieved 
(compared to 211 cases  in  PBRER02).  Majority  were male  (59% ;  previous  PBRER02 63% )  with  median 
age 65. 5  years  and  median TTO  14  days.  Pulmonary embolism  (122  cases)  followed by DVT (70  cases) 
was most  frequently reported.  Twenty-six  cases  had a fatal  outcome,  corresponding to a  CFR of 10%, 
which is  lower than the CFR for dose  1  cases  (17%). 
TTS after Dose 3:  Cumulatively,  8  cases of TTS  following the third dose were retrieved,  of which 6  cases 
occurred  after  a  Vaxzevria  booster  and 2  cases  after  a  mRNA  booster.  Median  age  was  28  years  and 
median TTO  12  days.  The  ratio female  to male was  equal.  One  case  had  a fatal  outcome,  but contained 
very  limited  information  as  it  was  based  on a social  media post  and  it  was  unclear  if  Vaxzevria  was  used 
as  a booster  dose.  One  case  was  classified  as  probable  and 2  cases as  possible according  to the MHRA 
Case Classification.  The  remaining  3 cases did not  mee  the  criteria,  including  the  fatal case.  No new 
concern regarding TTS has  been identified with  booster  doses  of Vaxzevria. 
Mechanism of TTS:  The  MAH reviewed new literature  regarding  the  potential  mechanism  of action  of 
TTS with Vaxzevria and  retrieved 4  relevant  articles.  Cohen et al.  (2022)  demonstrated  that  Vaxzevria did 
not result  in  an increased rate of  detection of anti-PF4 IgG  post-vaccination compared to placebo during 
the first 15 days  after  vaccination.  These data  were assessed as  part  of the  type  II variation 
EMEA/H/C/005675/11/0038.  Pitkanen  et  al.  (2021) suggested that  VITT  is  triggered by antibodies against 
adenovirus  vector  and  PF4-polyanion  complexes which strongly co-activate  complement and  platelets. 
Bhur  et  al.  (2022)  investigated  blood  and  thrombus  specimens  of a female patient who  suffered  severe 
stroke due  to  VITT  after vaccination  with  ChAdOxl  in comparison  to 13 control  stroke  patients  with 
similar  clinical  characteristics.  The  thrombus  of the  VITT-patient  exclusively  revealed  complement factors 
and high amounts  of  DNase  and  LL-37  and  serum  tests  indicated  either less  efficient  NET-inhibition  or 
enhanced  NET-induction  in  the  blood  of the VITT-patient.  Schonborn et al.  (2022)  noted that  Covid-19  did 
not restimulate  anti- PF4  antibodies  in  a cohort of 11  patients  with a history  of  VITT. 
The  MAH's  hypothesis  for  the  mechanism  of TTS  is  that  ChAdOxl-PF4  complexes  are  recognized by  pre­
existing  B-cell clones  encoding  pathogenic  anti-PF4  IgG.  The  boosted  production  of TTS inducing  anti-PF4 
antibodies  (IgG)  subsequently  triggers  thrombosis  via activation of  platelets  and  neutrophils.  However,  as 
1
also  discussed  during  a  EMA  workshop
,  several  gaps  in  the understanding  of TTS remain to be 
elucidated. 
Health  Canada  is  conducting  a comprehensive  review on TTS to  determine  whether there  is  a need for 
additional risk  minimization measures  in  Canada  for  Vaxzevria and requested  the  MAH to provide  specific 
information  on  this  topic  (see  section 15. 2. 15  of the  PBRER).  The majority  of the  requested  information  is 
included anyway  in  the  PBRERs and does  not  bring  additional  data  compared to the data  in  section 
16. 3. 2. 1. 
Upon request of  Health Canada,  the MAH discussed  observational  studies  on TTS  in Appendix 17  of the 
PBRER.  Data  from  observational  studies  showed  an  increased risk of TTS following  vaccination with the

first  dose  of  Vaxzevria.  The highest  relative  risk was observed in younger age groups.  However,  the  risk 
associated  with Vaxzevria was  much lower than  following COVID-19  infection.  These studies  have  some 
limitations as  only  one  study  used  clinician-verified validation of TTS cases and results across studies 
lacked consistency,  although different studies covered largely the same population (UK) during 
overlapping time periods (Dec 2020  - Apr 2021). 
CVST  with Thrombocytopenia:  data  presented  were  similar to those  presented in  PBRER02. 
In conclusion,  no new safety information concerning TTS could be identified.  The current risk  minimisation 
measures  described  in  the  product  information  are  considered  adequate. 
2.3.2.  Important  Identified  Risk  ( EU-specific)  - Thrombocytopenia,  including 
immune  thrombocytopenia 
Please note  that  Thrombocytopenia,  including immune thrombocytopenia data is not  reproduced here 
(Appendix  R3  - Section 2.2. 1  of the PBRER). 
MAH's summary 
Cumulatively,  2752  case  reports  of Thrombocytopenia  without  co-reported  thromboembolic  events  were 
received.  Out  of the  2752 cases,  66.4%  (1830)  cases are with Thrombocytopenia  alone  without  any 
associated  haemorrhage  and/or thrombosis  reports,  32. 5  %  (891) cases  are Thrombocytopenia with 
spontaneous bleeding and 1. 1 %  (31) cases  are  with Thrombocytopenia with  menstrual  bleeding.  Most 
frequent  bleeding events  reported were contusion  and  Petechiae.  Most  of the cases  were reported from 
United  Kingdom  and  Australia. 
There  were 92  (3. 3%) reports  with fatal  outcome,  with  majority of 55  (59. 7% )  of 92  cases  reported  in 
females.  Overall,  the  death rate  was  higher in age  group  over 50  years  (71  out  of 92  cases)  and 44  cases 
out  of 92  (48%) were  in  patient  with thrombocytopenia  associated  with bleeding. 
Out  of the  total 2752 case  reports  received for Thrombocytopenia without co-reported thromboembolic 
events,  the WHO-UMC causality  was  assessed  as  follows:  1694  (61.5%)  cases  were  assessed  as 
Possible  and  in 1317  (77. 7%) out  of 1694  cases,  the  assessment was  based  solely on  the  reasonable 
TTO  parameter and  no information  was  available  on  assessments  of other  etiologies,  or the  vaccinees' 
medical history,  comorbidities,  concomitant  medications,  etc.  For the  remaining 377  (22. 2%) of 1694 
cases  this  assessment  was  based  on  a reasonable TTO although the  event could  also  be  explained by  the 
vaccinees'  diseases.  873 (31. 7%) of case  reports  were  assessed  as  Unassessable/Unclassifiable,  179 
(6. 5%) cases  were  assessed as  Unlikely,  6  (0. 2%) cases  assessed  as  Probable-Likely.  None  of the 
cases  met WHO-UMC criteria for Certain (including immune  thrombocytopenia). 
The results of the  O/E  analyses  for  all thrombocytopenia cases  in risk windows  21  and 42 days  (along 
with unknown TTO  for  both risk windows)  suggest that observed cases  were  significantly  less  than 
expected cases. 
A  review  of the  published literature  did not  identify any  new safety  information  on  this  topic  in 
association  with VAXZEVRIA. 
MAH's conclusion 
From the data  identified  during  the  reporting period,  and taking  into account the  cumulative  experience, 
no new information  on  thrombocytopenia was  received during the reporting  period that changes the 
present understanding and  description  of the important identified risk in  EU  RMP and as  an  ADR in  EU 
SmPC.

However,  after the  data-lock  point  of this  PBRER,  AstraZeneca validated  a signal  for  Immune 
Thrombocytopenia  based on  new  well-documented  case  reports  of  Immune Thrombocytopenia with 
VAXZEVRIA  from the  published literature.  Evaluation of this  validated  signal is  ongoing as  per 
AstraZeneca's  signal  detection  and  evaluation  processes. 
Thrombocytopenia,  including  immune  thrombocytopenia will continue  to  be  kept under close surveillance 
by AstraZeneca. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
"Thrombocytopenia,  including  immune  thrombocytopenia" (ITP)  is  listed in  the  RMP as  an  important 
potential risk and  in  the  SmPC section 4. 8,  "Thrombocytopenia" is  listed with frequency 'common' and 
"Immune thrombocytopenia" is  listed with frequency 'not  known'.  In addition,  the  risk of 
thrombocytopenia including ITP is  described  in  section 4. 4  of the  SmPC.  This  paragraph refers to the  risk 
of  bleeding and  the  reports  of fatal  cases. 
While mild and  transient  thrombocytopenia was  a common  finding from  clinical trial,  the  cases  reported 
from  post-marketing experience  contain  a high proportion  of serious  cases  (92% ).  Less  severe cases 
remain  probably  undiscovered. 
Twenty two  (22)  of the 92 fatal  cases  were  reported during this  PSUR  period.  The  reported cause  of 
death was  variable  and,  in  many  cases,  involved more  than  one  event.  These causes  of  death are  similar 
to other causes  of death reported previously. 
During the  reporting period,  a literature search found 20  articles  including 32  literature cases.  Three 
cases  from the  literature  were classified  as  probable-likely  according  to WHO-UMC classification. 
Overall,  information  collected  on  thrombocytopenia including  immune  thrombocytopenia  does  not modify 
the conclusion of  previous  assessment.  No  change  to the SmPC sections 4.4  and 4. 8  is warranted.  New 
information  on thrombocytopenia does  not  change  the  B/R balance of  Vaxzevria. 
2.3.3.  Important  Identified  Risk  ( EU-specific)  - Guillain- Barre  Syndrome 
Please  note  that  GBS  data is not  reproduced here  (Appendix  R3  - Section 2. 2.2 and Appendix  20 of the 
PBRER). 
MAH's Summary 
During  the  period covered by  this  report  (29  December  2021  to 28 June 2022),  361 cases  were 
reported,  out  of which 211  (58. 4%) were  reported  by healthcare  professionals  (medically  confirmed). 
Out  of the  361  cases,  98 cases met the BCC 1 to BCC 3 level  criteria.  When the 98 are assessed 
according  to WHO-UMC causality criteria 8  did not  have sufficient  information  to do a causality 
assessment  and  were assessed  as  " Unassessable/unclassifiable" ,  16 were  assessed  as  " Unlikely" ,  and  74 
were assessed  as  " Possible"  causality  to  VAXZEVRIA. 
Out  of the  74  cases assessed for WHO-UMC causality  deemed as  " Possible",  66 had limited information 
on  other  aetiologies,  medical history,  concomitant  medications,  etc. ,  and 8  cases  had  risk  factors  or 
confounders.  Cases were considered to have  " risk factors/confounders"  where  the  event could  also  be 
explained  by  the  vaccinee's diseases,  relevant risk factors  that  were present,  or concomitant  medications 
that  could  potentially  contribute  to  the  development  of  the  event. 
The observed versus  expected analysis  of cumulative cases  reported with TTO  within all risk windows 
(14  days,  30  days and 42  days)  from vaccination  suggested that observed cases  are significantly less 
than  expected.  However,  when  cases  with an unknown time to onset  are  included  as a conservative 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  36/123 
approach,  observed cases  are  significantly  more  than  expected for 14  days  risk window and significantly 
less than  expected for 30  and 42 days  risk window.  Furthermore,  an  observed  versus  expected analysis 
of cases meeting the  BCC  Level 1,  2,  or 3  with TTO  within  14  days  from vaccination suggested that 
observed cases are significantly  more  than  expected,  while  for TTO  within 30 days and 42  days  from 
vaccination suggested  that  observed cases  are  significantly  less  than  expected. 
When cases  from  EEA  and  UK,  or  UK alone are analysed according  to age  group  and  sex,  as  well as  14, 
30,  and 42 day  windows,  numbers  of cases  become  very small,  resulting  in  some  categories  where 
observed  is greater than  expected  and in some categories  less  than  expected.  Also,  there  is  high 
variability  in  these data,  making  an  assessment  on  causal  association  not possible. 
During the  reporting period  of the  PBRER (29  December 2021  to 28 June 2022),  a signal  of  GBS was 
validated,  based  on  new information  from  retrospective  analysis as  well as  well-documented case 
reports  of GBS with COVID-19  VACCINE  ASTRAZENECA from  the  published  literature. 
Although there  are  epidemiological articles  describing  a  temporal  association  to the first  dose  of 
VAXZEVRIA,  the  risk was  approximately 4  times  greater  after  a  COVID-19  infection.  Therefore,  there  are 
still  gaps  in  understanding  the  effect  of the  COVID-19  pandemic  in  the  background.  The  comparison  the 
authors  of literature  articles  carried  out between  VAXZEVRIA  and  Comirnaty  had  limitations  due  to  the 
differences  in  the  populations  receiving  the  vaccine,  ie,  VAXZEVRIA  was mostly used  in  an  elderly 
population  that  is more  prone  to  develop GBS. 
Taking this  into  consideration,  AstraZeneca included GBS in the existing language on demyelinating 
disorders in Section 4.4 of the  CDS.  In  line with this,  the  relevant text  on GBS was  added  to the CPIL 
to  inform the vaccinees  to seek early medical care irrespective of the underlying  aetiology of 
GBS. 
Based  on  the  review of available evidence  from literature and  from reports in  the safety  database  on the 
topic of the facial diplegia/bifacial weakness with  paraesthesia variant of GBS, AstraZeneca considers 
that there  is not  sufficient  evidence to  confirm any  particular clinical  features  associated  with 
vaccination  or establish a causal  association  with VAXZEVRIA. 
AstraZeneca will continue to closely monitor GBS as part of our surveillance activities (nervous system 
disorders, including immune mediated neurological conditions)  and  take further actions as deemed 
necessary. 
MAH's conclusion 
From the data  identified  during  the  reporting period,  and also taking  into account the  cumulative 
experience,  no new information  on GBS  to  warrant any  changes  in  the  EU SmPC and EU  RMP. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
The  MAH provided a review of cases reported during the interval period  (29  Dec  2021-28 Jun  2022).  Of 
the 361  cases,  98 cases  met the  BCC  levels 1-3.  Causality  assessment according  to WHO-UMC causality 
criteria classified 76 cases  as with a possible and  none  with a probable  causal  association with Vaxzevria. 
Most of the  cases  (88% )  were  classified  as possible  with  limited  information. 
Cumulatively,  1703  cases  were  reported,  most  of which were  serious  (99. 5%).  37  cases  (2. 2%) had a 
fatal  outcome. 
Pattern and variant of GBS:  In the  reporting period,  22  cases  of GBS had  facial  diplegia/bifacial weakness 
as  symptoms.  However,  only 1  case described the GBS  variant  of interest  (i. e.  bifacial  weakness  and 
t 
paraesthesia  [BWP])  in  a 39  years  old  male.  The  AEs occurred 16  days  after the  p
dose  of  Vaxzevria  and 
required  hospitalisation  the  patient was  treated  with  immunoglobulin  and  the  AEs  improved. 
PRAC  PSUR assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  37 /123 
Overall,  no  clinical  pattern  has  been identified after vaccination  with  Vaxzevria.  Facial  diplegia in  interval 
cases  of GBS has  been  reported  at a lower frequency (i. e.  ~6% )  than  described  in  the  literature  (i. e.  up 
to 50%). 
In the literature,  Andreozzi  et al.  (2022)  published 2 cases  of  BWP  variant  of GBS,  both  occurring  after 
t 
the  p
dose  of  Vaxzevria.  The authors also  performed a systematic  literature  review and  identified 11 
additional cases of  BWP  variant after COVID-19  vaccination. 
Besides,  Kim et al.  (2022)  retrospectively  reviewed  medical records  and  identified  13 patients  with GBS 
post COVID-19  vaccination,  including 8  cases  after  Vaxzevria.  The variants  identified  in the review were 
paraparetic GBS (n=3),  Miller fisher syndrome  (n=l) and acute cervicobrachial  weakness  (n= l).  No case 
of  BWP variant  was observed. 
O/E analysis:  Observed versus  expected analysis only showed a significant  increase  when  cases  with 
unknown TTO were  included  in  the  analysis  with  a 14  day  risk  period. 
These findings are similar to those  observed  in  the previous  PSUR. 
Of note,  Atzenhoffer  et al 2022  published  in  the  literature  an  O/E analysis  using  spontaneous  data  from 
VigiBase  and  exposure  information  from  Our World  in  Data  (OLP 15. 10. 2021).  The authors  identified  an 
imbalance  for  adenovirus-vectored COVID-19 vaccines  with  an  O/E  ratio  > 2. 0  but  not  for  mRNA-based 
vaccines  (i. e.  RR  adeno:  5.57 (5. 13-6.03) per  100,000  py;  RR  mRNA:  1. 39  (1.31-1. 47);  background 
incidence :  1. 2-3. 1  per 100,000 py).  The  authors  highlighted  some  limitations  in  their analysis  including 
limited  clinical  data  from  VigiBase  and  lack  of exposure  data  stratified  by age  and  sex.  Moreover,  the 
background incidence rates  used  in the analysis were lower than  those  from the  MAH and  derived from 
ACCESS  protocol. 
Mechanism  of action: The  literature  reviewed  identified  several  papers  (Aliasin et al.  2022;  Chen  et  al. 
2022;  Shafiq  et al.  2022) discussing hypotheses  for GBS occurring  after  COVID-19  vaccination.  Briefly, 
the following  mechanisms  of action have been suggested: 
- binding  of the  S  protein  to  the  sialic  acid  located  on  the gangliosides  and  glycoproteins  of the  neurons' 
cell  membrane.  Antibodies  attacking  to  S  protein might  also respond  against  the  antigens  on  the  myelin 
sheaths; 
- similarity  of vaccine  epitopes  with  myelin  or  axon epitopes,  which  after recognition  can  trigger  cellular 
and humoral  immune  responses,  leading to antibodies  synthesis  aberrantly  against  myeline,  following  a 
degradation  of axon  or  myelin  membranes due  to  direct  exposure  of vaccine  virus  or vaccine-related 
products; 
- molecular  mimicry and  production  of autoantibodies; 
- immune  overactivation  or  dysregulation  in  patients who  already have an  underlying  predisposition  to 
autoimmune disease. 
However,  the  exact mechanism  still remains to be  elucidated. 
Closed signal:  the  MAH reviewed a signal  of GBS during  the  reporting period and  concluded  that a 
warning  should be added in  the CDS (see  Section 2. 2. 2  for further details).  Of note,  in  the  EU-PI  of 
Vaxzevria,  a warning  was  already  included  in  section 4. 4  before  the  review of the MAH's  signal. 
Overall conclusion:  information becoming available  during  the  period under  review did not  raise  any  new 
safety concern.  Moreover,  data  from spontaneous  reporting and  the  literature did not suggest  that  a 
specific clinical  pattern,  such as  BWP variant,  is  associated  with GBS cases  reports  after  Vaxzevria 
vaccination. 
PRAC  PSUR assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  38/123 
As  previously  discussed,  the  PRAC  Rapporteur considers  that  a causal  association  between Guillain-Barre 
and  Vaxzevria  should  be considered  at  least  a reasonable  possibility  ( disagreement  with  the  MAH's 
opinion).  Currently,  GBS  is appropriately described in the EU-PI  (sections 4. 4  and 4. 8) and  in the 
EU-RMP  (important  identified risk).  Moreover,  GBS  will  continue  to be closely monitored  as part  of  the 
surveillance activities  including routine  PhV  and  PASS.  No further  action  is  required. 
2.3.4.  Important  Identified  Risk ( EU-specific)  - Ana phylaxis 
Please note  that Anaphylaxis  data  is not  reproduced here  (Regional Appendix  R3  - Section 2.2 of the 
PBRER) 
During the  period  covered  by  this  report,  3168  cases  were received for the  AESI  of  Anaphylaxis,  reporting 
3758  AEs  that  were part  of the  Anaphylaxis  AESI  concept.  Cumulatively,  there  have  been 20557  case 
reports  of Anaphylaxis. 
MAH's conclusion 
From review of the  interval  and  cumulative data,  there  is  no new safety  information  on  Anaphylaxis that 
changes  the  present understanding and  description of the risk. 
During the  reporting interval,  Anaphylaxis  was  reclassified  as  non-important  identified risk and  removed 
from the  list  of safety  concerns at  the  request  of  EMA (see section 3).  AstraZeneca will not  discuss this 
topic in  the  future  PBRERs,  unless significant new safety  information  arises. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
During the current reporting period 3168  cases were reported,  and  these  cases reported 3758 AEs. 
Cumulatively,  a total  of 20557  AEs  belonging to the  Anaphylaxis  AESI  concept  were reported.  It  is  noted 
that  there  were 23  (0. 93% )  fatal  cases  during  the  reporting period. 
The  data provided  in  the  PSUR  do not  raise  any  new safety  issue.  The current warning in  section 4.4  is 
sufficient to  minimise the  risk of anaphylaxis  and  the risk of anaphylaxis  and  hypersensitivity  is 
appropriately described  in  section 4. 8. 
Anaphylaxis  is  no longer an important identified risk as  it  is  now considered fully characterised  and  no 
additional RMM  are  ongoing or  planned. 
2.3.5.  Important  potential risk( EU-specific)  - Thrombosis 
Please note  that  Thrombosis  data  is not  reproduced  here  (Regional Appendix  R3  - Section  2. 1 . 1  of the 
PBRER). 
MAH's  summary 
A  total  of 2567 cases  were  received  in  the reporting  period and 18690  cumulatively. 
Frequently reported thrombosis events  (> 150  events) included  Pulmonary  embolism  (518,  20.2%), 
Cerebrovascular  accident  (438,  17.1%),  Deep  vein  thrombosis  (387,  15. 1%),  Thrombosis  with 
thrombocytopenia syndrome  (235,  9. 2%),  and Myocardial  infarction  (185,  7. 2%). 
The highest  number of cases  were  received from  Brazil 497 cases  (19. 4%) followed  by  UK 493 cases 
(19. 2% ) and Germany  with 385  cases  (15. 0%).  A  total  of 1300  case  reports were reported  in  females, 
and 1198  were reported  in  males,  and  in 69 cases  the gender was  not reported.  Out  of 2567,  5  cases 
occurred  in  the  paediatric population  (One  in 3  weeks and 6 days,  one  in  one  year and 9  months,  one  in 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  39/123 
12  years  and  two in 17  years)  and  in 206  cases age was  not  reported.  The  overall  median age  was  59 
years with a range  of O  (3  weeks  and 6  days)  to 97  years  for  all cases  where  age  was  reported. 
Of the 2567  case  reports  received during  the reporting  interval,  371  (14. 5%) cases  had  a fatal  outcome 
compared to a cumulative  fatality  rate  of 8. 1 %  (1512 fatal  out  of 18690  thrombosis case  reports).  There 
were 224  medically confirmed cases  and 147  non-medically confirmed cases  with a fatal  outcome.  There 
was  no  marked  difference  in  the  interval  versus  the  cumulative  fatality  rate.  371  fatal  reports were 
received in  the  interval;  110  (29. 6%) were  initial reports  and 261  (70. 4%) were follow-ups.  55  (14. 9% ) 
of the 110  initial reports  were  medically confirmed.  The large  number (261)  of follow up reports  in  the 
interval  accounts  for higher fatality  rate  for the  interval.  Of the  initial reports,  30  (27. 3% )  were  from 
Brazil. 
The  overall  cumulative  thrombosis  fatality  rate  was highest  (14. 5% )  in  vaccines aged 80  years  and most 
of these reports  were  in  vaccinees  with  underlying  comorbidities.  The  cumulative  case  fatality  rate in 
vaccinees  aged 18-29  years,  30-39  years,  and 40-49  years was  11. 6%,  9. 3%,  and  7. 0  respectively. 
However,  in  the  18-29,  30-39-,  and 40-49-years age group,  21. 3%  (27  out  of 127  fatal  reports),  15. 1% 
(35  out  of 232  fatal  reports)  and 12. 0%  (39  out  of 325  fatal reports)  of the  fatal case  were due  to 
thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia which may explain increased fatality rate  in  vaccinees 
aged  <  50  years. 
MAH's  conclusion 
From the data  identified  during  the  reporting period,  and considering  the cumulative  experience,  no new 
information  on Thrombosis  was  received  during  the  reporting period that  changes  the  present 
understanding  and  description  of the  important  potential  risk.  No changes  to  the  EU Sm PC are warranted 
at  this  time.  AstraZeneca will continue  to monitor safety  information  for Thrombosis  as  part  of the  routine 
safety  surveillance  activities  for  VAXZEVRIA  and  take further actions  as  deemed  appropriate. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
During the  period under review,  2567 cases (2543 serious,  1337  medically confirmed) were  retrieved for 
the AESI  of Thrombosis.  However,  almost half  of the  identified  cases  ( 1214)  were  follow-up cases. 
Cumulatively up  to 28 June 2022,  18,690  cases  reporting Thrombotic  events,  with  and  without 
thrombocytopenia,  were retrieved. 
The reported cases  show  similar information/trends  regarding gender and  age  distribution  (median  age 
59  years,  52%  females), TTO (median TTO 12  days),  type of thromboembolic event  and  outcome as  in 
the previous  PSUR (PSUR02).  The case  fatality  rate  for the reporting interval  is 14. 9%  compared  to a 
cumulative  case  fatality  rate  of 8. 1 %.  The  higher fatality  rate  for the  interval is due  to the  large  number 
of fatal follow-up reports (261 out  of 371  fatal  reports (70. 4%)) received  during  the  interval. 
Out  of the  2567 case  reports,  402 occurred  after  dose 2  and 20  occurred  after  dose  3.  Of note,  5  (25% ) 
of the 20  case  reports post  dose 3  had  a fatal  outcome  and  three  of these  fatal cases  involved  individuals 
under the  age  of 70 (22,  45  and 62 years  old).  Co-reported AEs in  the 5  fatal  cases  included  (1  each): 
acute  myocardial  infarction,  coronary  artery  thrombosis,  dyspnoea,  ischaemic  stroke,  myocardial 
infarction,  pulmonary embolism,  respiratory distress  and thrombosis  with thrombocytopenia  syndrome. 
Since information  on  medical history,  concomitant  drugs and  co-reported AEs  was  not  provided  on case 
level,  but  only  for the 5  fatal cases combined,  it  was  not  possible  to assess  the  causality  for these  five 
cases.  In  the next  PBRER,  the  MAH should  provide  a tabular summary of the  fatal  cases 
reporting  a thrombotic  event after  dose  3  (or dose  4)  of  the vaccine.  [Request for the  next 
PBRER] 
As requested,  the  MAH  discussed  the cases  where  thromboembolic  events  occurred both after dose 1  and 
dose 2  (potential 'rechallenge'  cases).  All 10 cases  contained  limited  information  or reported  important 
PRAC  PSUR assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  40/123 
confounding factors.  There  were  no cases  of recurrence  of thromboembolic  events  after  dose  3. 
The  MAH performed  overall  O/E analyses using  global data  and  O/E analyses by  age and  gender using  UK 
data.  All analyses were carried out with risk windows of 14,  28 and 42 days.  None of the O/E analyses 
showed  a  disproportionality  and  observed cases  were  significantly less  than  expected for  all 
stratifications. 
The  PRAC  rapporteur agrees  with the  MAH's  conclusion  and to continue  to closely  monitor this  important 
potential risk. 
2.3.6.  Important  potential risk  - CVST  without thrombocytopenia 
Please  note  that  data on  CVST  without thrombocytopenia is not  reproduced here (Section 1 6. 3. 1 . 1  of the 
PBRER). 
MAH's summary 
AstraZeneca  continued  to  review  the safety  information  for CVST without  thrombocytopenia  from  sources 
including clinical trials,  post-marketing reports,  and  the  published  literature  for the reporting  period. 
There were  no reports  of CVST without  thrombocytopenia related AEs in  the  Oxford  pooled  studies.  There 
was 1  report  of  Cerebral  venous/Cerebral  venous  sinus  thrombosis  identified  in  the  VAXZEVRIA group  in 
US Study  (D8110C00001),  however,  there was no new  safety  information  received in  the  reporting 
period. 
A  review of the  post-marketing data did not  identify  any  index case  or  a new safety  signal.  There were  no 
case  reports  with positive re-challenge (after the  first and second  dose  of the vaccine).  There  are 573 and 
89  cases  for the cumulative and  reporting  period  respectively.  Cumulatively,  there  was a  preponderance 
for female  gender (61 % )  versus  males  (35% ),  and 68%  cases  were  in  age group 18-64  years.  Twelve 
(12)  fatal cases  (92% )  out of all 13 fatal cases  (in  all  age  groups)  were reported  in  females  in  the 
reporting  period.  Cumulatively,  28  (60.8%) out  of all 46  fatal cases  were  reported  in  females.  There  was 
no significant difference  noted  between  the  cumulative  and  reporting  period  in  terms  of the  volume  and 
distribution  of  cases. 
A  review of the  published literature did  not  identify  any  new  safety  information on  this  topic  in association 
with  VAXZEVRIA. 
The  Observed versus  Expected  analysis  was  carried  out  using  incidence  rates  from ACCESS:  SIDIAP 
PCHOSP and Truven  MarketScan (2019).  SIDIAP PCHOSP  is  representative  of the general population in 
terms  of age,  sex,  and geographic  distribution  and  that  the  rate  was  used  by  the  EMA,  and  this  would 
permit a comparison  of the  O/E analysis  conducted by  EMA,  whereas Truven MarketScan was  used for 
consistency  with background  rates  for TTS generated using MarketScan.  The results  showed  observed 
cases  are  more  than  expected in  the general  population  globally.  The age  stratifications suggest that  the 
O/E ratio is  higher  in  younger age  groups  than  in  the  older  age  groups  and  that  the  O/E ratio is  higher  in 
females than  in males.  However,  it  is  important  to note  that  O/E analyses  are  complementary to routine 
signal  detection methods,  and  are  not designed to  determine  a causal relationship;  confounding factors 
were  not considered  in  O/E (such as possible  COVID-19  infections  or  other possible  causes  for CVST 
without  thrombocytopenia). 
CVST without  thrombocytopenia is  an  important  potential risk in  the  VAXZEVRIA Core  Risk  Management 
Plan  and  the  topic  will continue  to  be  kept under close  surveillance  by AstraZeneca. 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report

Page  41/123 
MAH's conclusion 
From the data  identified  during  the  reporting period and  also  taking  into account the  cumulative 
experience,  AstraZeneca considers  that  there  is  currently  insufficient evidence  of a reasonable  possibility 
of causal relationship  between  VAXZEVRIA  and CVST without  thrombocytopenia.  CVST without 
thrombocytopenia is  included  in  section 4. 4  (section 4.4  Warnings  and  Precautions)  of the CDS to  inform 
prescribers  that  these  events  may require different treatment approaches than TTS.  Healthcare 
professionals  should  consult  applicable guidance.  No changes  to the CDS or product  leaflets  are 
warranted  at  this  time. 
AstraZeneca  will continue  to  monitor  safety  information  for CVST without  thrombocytopenia  as  an 
important potential risk and  take  further actions  as  deemed appropriate. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
Cumulatively,  up  to 28 June 2022,  573 cases of  CVST  without thrombocytopenia have  been reported 
(566 serious,  340 medically confirmed),  compared to  508  cases  in  PSUR02.  Taking into account the 
estimated number of  doses administered cumulatively (2,097,714,177),  approximately 0. 27  cases/1 
million  doses  occurred  during  the  overall  period,  which  is  slightly lower than  in  the  previous  PSUR02 
(0. 32/1  million  doses). 
The updated cumulative  review  of cases  of CVST without  thrombocytopenia  resulted  in  similar 
information/trends regarding  age and gender distribution (median  age 51  years,  61 %  females),  reported 
CVST PTs,  outcome,  and case  fatality  rate  (8%)  as  the  cumulative  review  provided  in  PSUR02. 
Information  on TTO was  not provided for the  cumulative  period. 
During the  current reporting  period,  89  cases  (53  initial,  36  follow-up)  of CVST  without 
thrombocytopenia  were  retrieved.  All cases  were  serious  and 49  of them  were  medically  confirmed.  The 
majority  of the  cases  were  reported  in  females  (70%).  Median  age  was 45. 5  years  (age  range:  20-90 
years).  Median TTO  was  12.5 days  (range  0-301 days)  compared  to 39  days  (range  0-301 days)  for the 
cumulative period in  PSUR02. 
Thirteen  of the  89  cases  had a fatal  outcome,  resulting  in  a case  fatality  rate  (CFR)  of 14. 6%  compared to 
a cumulative CFR of  8%.  The  higher CFR for the reporting interval  is  due  to the  large proportion of fatal 
follow-up reports  (6  out  of 13 reports  (46%)) received  during  the  interval.  Confounding factors (i. e. 
comorbidities,  risk factors, concomitant medications) were reported  in 23. 5%  of the  patients.  The  CVST 
event  occurred post  2nd  dose  in 12 case  reports  ( 13%).  There  were  no  cases  with  a positive rechallenge 
(CVST event(s)  both after  dose 1 and  dose 2). 
The  MAH performed causality  assessment using WHO-UMC  criteria.  Out  of the  89  cases  reported during 
the current  interval  period,  1  case  was  classified  as 'Conditional/Unclassified',  13 cases  ( 15%)  as 
'Unlikely',  28  cases  (31 % )  as 'Unassessable'  ( of  which  23  with  limited information  and 5  with 
confounders),  and 47  cases  as 'Possible' (53% )  (of  which  37  with  limited information  and 10 with 
confounders). 
A  literature  review  on CVST did  not identify new relevant  safety  information. 
The results of the MAH's  updated  O/E analyses  for CVST without  thrombocytopenia were  in  line with 
PSUR02.  Observed  cases were  significantly higher than  expected  in  the  general  population  globally  for  all 
risk windows  except for the  risk window of 42 days  when  cases  with unknown TTO were  excluded.  The 
age  and  gender stratifications  suggest  that  the  O/E ratio  is  higher in  the younger age groups than  in  the 
older  age  groups  and  higher  in  females  than  in  males. 
As initially  discussed  in  MSSR07,  the  PRAC  Rapporteur  disagrees  with the  MAH's  conclusion  on  causality. 
A  causal  association  between CVST  without  thrombocytopenia  and  Vaxzevria  should be considered  at 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report

least  a reasonable  possibility.  Cerebrovascular venous and sinus  thrombosis  is  listed with frequency 
unknown  in section 4. 8  of the  SmPC and  a warning on  the risk of CVST  without  thrombocytopenia was 
included in  section  4.4. 
In conclusion,  no new safety  information  concerning  CVST  without  thrombocytopenia could be identified. 
The current  risk minimisation  measures described  in  the  product  information  are  considered  adequate. 
The  MAH should  continue  to closely  monitor cases  of CVST without thrombocytopenia,  present updates  in 
the next  PBRERs,  and  discuss  relevant  literature. 
2.3.7.  Important  potential risk  -Immune-mediated  neurological conditions / 
Nervous system disorders,  including  immune-mediated  neurological 
conditions  during  the  re porting  period 
Cumulatively,  a total  of 36033  cases  from  literature,  clinical  studies,  non-interventional  studies  and 
spontaneous sources  were reported within  the concept  of immune-mediated  neurological  disorders.  This 
includes a total  of 5641 cases  reported during  the  period under review. 
The most commonly reported  PTs  (interval) were Paraesthesia (2976),  Hypoaesthesia  (1982), 
Neuralgia (358),  Guillain-Barre syndrome  (318),  Sensory  disturbance  (232),  Neuropathy  peripheral 
(93),  Myelitis  transverse  (80),  Sensory loss  (79),  Polyneuropathy  (63),  Optic  neuritis (49), 
Encephalitis  ( 42), Acute disseminated  encephalomyelitis  (37),  Myelitis  (35),  Multiple  sclerosis 
(33),  Chronic  inflammatory  demyelinating  polyradiculoneuropathy  (28),  Multiple  sclerosis  relapse (24), 
Neuritis  (19),  Miller  Fisher syndrome  (18),  Demyelination  (18),  Neuromyelitis  optica spectrum 
disorder (15),  Myelopathy  (14),  Peripheral sensory neuropathy  (12),  Myelin  oligodendrocyte  glycoprotein 
antibody-associated  disease  (12). 
2.3.7.1.  Encephalitis,  including  fatal 
Please  note  that  the Encephalitis data is not  reproduced  here  (Section  16.3. 1 . 2. 1  of the PBRER). 
During  the  period covered  by  this  report,  93  cases  (64 initial case  reports and 29  follow-up cases) 
were reported using the  narrow  MedDRA SMQ:  Noninfective  Encephalitis  (excluding Acute disseminated 
encephalomyelitis) and HLT:  Encephalopathy. 
Out  of the 93  cases:  90  (96. 8%) cases  are  serious  and 58  (62. 4%) were  medically  confirmed. 
Gender/age:  there  were 50  (53. 8%) reports  for  female  vaccinees,  39  (41.9%) were  for  male  vaccinees 
[gender  not  reported  in 4.3%  cases].  65  (69. 9% )  of  vaccinees  were from  the  age  group  of 18  < 65  (adult) 
and median  age  is 52  years. 
Doses:  there  were 60 cases  after  dose  1,  18 cases after  dose 2 and 1  case  reported with  booster  dose; 
no case  of rechallenge  was  reported. 
ITO:  the median TTO was  13  days;  (44) (47. 3% ) cases  were  within  the  risk window of 2-42  days. 
Fatalities:  there  were 6  (2.4%)  cases  with  fatal outcome. 
The cause  of  death for 1  case  was  reported  as not related to encephalitis and  it  was  reported as  left 
parietal  extensive intracerebral congestive haemorrhage.  In the  remaining cases  the cause  of  death was 
encephalitis  (BCC l/possible  with  confounder),  hypoxic  encephalopathy  (BCC4),  encephalopathy 
(BCC4),  myelin  oligodendrocyte  glycoprotein  antibody  positive  encephalomyelitis  (BCC4),  and  hypoxic 
ischemic encephalopathy  (BCC4). 
The case  of fatal encephalitis 
)  assessed  as a  BCCl  possibly related with confounder was 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  43/123 
from  MHRA.  It  was  reported that  a 49/M  patient with a  medical history  of  bipolar disorder  experienced 
encephalitis  on  day 1.  On  further narrative  review,  it was stated  that  patient  experienced  dizziness  on  an 
unknown date after the  first dose  of AZ  vaccine and was  hospitalized due  to this.  The patient was 
diagnosed  with encephalitis 3  weeks  after  admission.  Therefore,  TTO  was  conservatively  presumed  to  be 
within  the risk window  and  the  causality assessed as 'possible  with confounder'  (i. e.  confounder was 
concomitant  medication  valproate  sodium). 
The review of 6  case  reports  with fatal  outcome  did  not  identify any  substantial  evidence  of a causal 
association  between encephalitis  and VAXZEVRIA. 
BCC  criteria  and  causality assessment{WHO-UCM criteria 7:  out  of the 93 cases,  1 case  fulfilled level 1 
criteria (fatal  case),  6 cases  fulfilled level  2  criteria,  8  cases  fulfilled level  3  criteria,  57  cases  fulfilled 
level 4  criteria,  and 21 cases  fulfilled level 5  criteria. 
Out  of the  15  cases  with  BCC level 1-3,  3 cases  were evaluated  as  possible  with confounders,  9  cases as 
possible  with limited information,  2  cases  as  unlikely  and 1 case  was  unassessable/unclassifiable. 
Cumulatively  (up until 28  December 2021),  a total of 343 cases  were  identified. 
Observed Versus Expected Analysis:  the  O/E analysis of cumulative cases  for encephalitis showed 
that observed cases occurred  significantly less frequently than  expected  for  all cases (343) and 
cases  with  BCC 1-3 (49),  all  age  stratifications  in  EENUK,  Brazil,  and  Australia,  and  risk windows.  The 
contribution  of under-reporting cannot  be  estimated,  but  observed  cases are  significantly  below  expected 
and do not  indicate  a  signal. 
Overall,  the  clinical  pattern  of case  presentation  and  numbers  of reports  are  broadly  consistent  with what 
might  be  expected from  the natural  epidemiology  of  encephalitis,  and  there  are  no  specific  biological 
mechanism  for  development  of encephalitis post  vaccination  with  VAXZEVRIA. 
MAH's conclusion:  from the data  identified  during  the  reporting period and  taking  into account the 
cumulative  experience,  there  is  currently  insufficient  evidence  of a causal  association  between 
encephalitis  and VAXZEVRIA. 
No  further updates to the  VAXZEVRIA CDS (i. e.  Section 4. 4  currently  warnings  on  Neurological  events 
and encephalitis)  or RMP are warranted at this  time.  As such,  the topic  will continue  to be to be  closely 
monitored  as part of AstraZeneca's ongoing  surveillance efforts  for the  important potential risk of  nervous 
system disorders,  including  immune mediated  neurological conditions 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
The  MAH provided a review of interval cases  of  encephalitis,  including a causality assessment according to 
the WHO-UMC.  Out  of 93 cases,  only  a  minority  fulfilled  BC  Level 1-3 criteria.  (i. e.  1 fatal case  BC  level 1, 
6 cases BC Level 2  and 8 cases BC  Level 3).  9 cases were  assessed  as  possibly related with limited 
information and 3  cases  as  possibly related  with confounders. 
Regarding fatal  cases,  there  was  1  case  classified  as  BC  Level  1  reporting encephalitis as  the  cause  of 
death.  The case  was  described  in  a 49  male subject  with  a  medical history  of  bipolar disorder and  was 
confounded  with the  concomitant  administration  of  valproate  sodium.  Other cases  were  classified as  BC 
Level 4  (n=4) or reported cause  of  death was  not encephalitis  (n= l). 
The  O/E analysis  cleared showed an  O/E ratio significantly  lower than  1. 
The literature  review  performed  by  the  MAH did not  identify  any  relevant articles  other than  several case 
reports  (8  papers  describing  12 cases  of encephalitis). 
In conclusion,  available data did  not raise any  new  safety  signal.  Routine monitoring  of  encephalitis

as  part  of the  monitoring  of the  important  potential risk of  Nervous system disorders,  including  immune­
mediated  neurological conditions  is  appropriate. 
2.3.7.2.  Transverse  myelitis 
Please  note  that  Transverse  myelitis  data is not  reproduced here  (Section  1 6. 3. 1 . 2.2.  of the PBRER). 
During the  period  covered  by  this  report,  112 cases  [Search  strategy:  MedDRA PTs Myelitis 
transverse,  Myelitis,  and  Acute  necrotizing  myelitis,  and  LLT  MOG-transverse  myelitis]. 
Out  of the  112 cases:  96  (85. 7% )  cases are serious  and 47  (42. 0%) were  medically confirmed. 
Gender/age:  there  were 55  (49. 1% )  reports  for  female  vaccinees,  54  (48. 2% )  were  for  male  vaccinees 
[gender  not  reported  in 2. 7%  cases].  The  median  age was 50  years. 
Doses:  there  were 35 cases  after  dose  1,  22  cases after  dose 2 and 3  cases  reported  with third/booster 
dose;  no case  of rechallenge was  reported. 
ITO:  the median TTO was  15  days;  60  cases  occurred  within 42 days  [TTO  unknown  in 38  cases]. 
Fatalities:  there  were 1 case with fatal  outcome  : The  patient  received a  Flu vaccine and  AZ vaccine 
about 3  weeks  apart and subsequently developed neurological features  of  myelopathy  - with 
encephalopathy;  termed atypical GBS and myelitis,  although the  features could be solely related to TM. 
The  pattern  of neurological  symptoms  is  consistent  with transverse myelitis  (longitudinally extensive TM 
as  well as plexitis are  noted  in  the narrative  suggesting  Imaging obtained of spinal cord),  with an 
encephalopathy  of hypoxic  ischemic  origin  as  noted upon hospital  admission.  Patient refused  initial 
recommended admission  which was  based  on  lower extremity weakness  and  sensory  change  and  urinary 
retention with upper  extremity being normal.  Upon admission  approx.  2  days  later there  was  a noted 
aspiration pneumonia and cognitive  changes  including  delirium.  There  was  insufficient  information  on 
exclusion  of  other  causes  of  acute  delirium.  Insufficient response  to  Ivig,  methylprednisolone  and  plasma 
exchange suggests  possible  non-immune  etiology.  Additionally,  there  was  insufficient  information  on 
medical history,  CNS  investigations  results  (CSF),  radiological  investigations  (although longitudinally 
extensive  transverse myelitis was  mentioned  as  well as  plexitis),  clinical  and  radiological course  of 
transverse  myelitis,  autopsy  and  etiological work-up  (in  the context  of fever,  hypoxia).  The BCC case 
classification  for transverse myelitis  was considered as BCC3  due  to  clinical observations  and 
fever.  There  is  insufficient  information  on  imaging,  carcinoma work up  (plexitis),CSF investigation  and 
autopsy.  TTO  of neurologic  symptoms  at  a reasonable time-frame to  both vaccinations  (1  month to 
Influenza vaccine,  2  weeks  to COVID-19 vaccine).  BCC  case  classification  for GBS was considered as 
BCC4,  considering the  lack  of information  in regard  other clinical  symptoms,  electrophysiology  test and 
CSF.  The WHO-UMC  causality  assessed  as  Possible  based  on  temporal  association  for TM. 
BCC criteria and causality assessment{WHO-UCM criteria 7: out of the 112 cases,  no case  fulfilled level 1 
criteria,  13  cases  fulfilled level  2  criteria,  9 cases  fulfilled level 3  criteria,  68  cases  fulfilled level  4 
criteria,  and 22 cases  fulfilled level  5  criteria. 
Out  of the 22 cases with BCC level  2-3,  4  cases  were  evaluated as possible  with confounders  [including 
early  development  of  multiple  sclerosis,  concomitant paraneoplastic syndrome,  possible  pre-existing 
spinal pathology],  15  cases as  possible  with limited information,  2  cases as  unlikely and 1  case was 
unassessable/unclassifiable. 
The CSF results  as  available  (15 out  of 22  cases)  presented  a varied  picture  with respect to extent  of 
pleocytosis  (normal count  in 1  case,  less  than  100  cells/ul  in  7  cases,  more  than  100  in  7  cases). 
Information  on  oligoclonal  bands  in TM  cases  was  reported  in 5  out  of 22  cases  (3  negative  and 2 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  4 5/123 
positive). 
Information  on serum  or  CSF  levels  on anti-neuronal antibodies  was  reported  in 13 out  of 22 cases 
5  cases  had  positive  anti-neuronal  antibodies  (MOG-Ab  positive  in 4 cases  and  NMO-Ab  positive  in 1 
case),  and 8  had  negative  results. 
To summarize,  either there  was  limited information  or CSF picture  including  neuronal  antibodies  had  a 
varied presentation  to identify  any singular  etiopathogenetic  possible  role of  VAXZEVRIA 
Cumulatively  (up until 28 June 2022),  a total  of 354 cases  were  identified. 
Observed Versus Expected Analysis:  When the  observed versus  expected analysis  is  carried out 
overall  for global reports  for  all  ages and  genders,  the number of observed cases  is significantly less 
than expected for  all stratifications provided. 
When stratified by  age only in the  UK  (using  ADVANCE  EUROPE rates,  including cases  with known 
TTO),  observed cases  are more  or  significantly more  than  expected  for  all  age groups,  except for the 
age  group 45-64  years  (observed  cases are less than  expected).  When the  cases with an  unknown TTO 
are  included for all  age  groups,  observed cases are more  than  expected  with a significant 
disproportionality. 
When stratified by  gender  and age in the  UK  (using  UKTHIN  rates,  including  cases  with known TTO), 
the  observed cases  for  females  are more  than  expected  in  all the age  groups  except for 45-64  years 
( observed cases  were  significantly  less  than  expected),  without  the  result  being  significant.  Observed 
cases  were significantly more  than  expected for females  overall when  cases  with unknown TTO were 
included.  For males,  the  observed cases more  than expected  in  the youngest  age group  (15-24 years), 
the  oldest  age  group  (65+  years),  and  overall.  When cases  with unknown TTO were  included,  all  age 
groups  had observed higher than  expected. 
In addition,  an  observed versus  expected analysis  of cumulative  cases  meeting Brighton collaboration 
criteria levels 1-3  showed  that the observed number  of TM  cases  fulfilling case definition  are  either less 
than  or  significantly  less  than  the  number of  expected  cases  in  all risk windows. 
Observed  vs expected analyses  overall  and  stratified  by BCC,  age,  gender and dose  number were 
provided but are not  reproduced here  (please  refer to PBRER Section 16. 3. 1. 2. 2  - Tables 188-193  and 
Appendix  9 Tables 44-52). 
Literature:  1 article (Netravathi et  al 2022)  was  identified and  its assessment  did  not find any safety 
finding with impact  on  benefit-risk profile  of VAXZEVRIA  (see Section 2. 3. 7. 3.  for further  discussion). 
Mechanism: The pathogenesis for TM  is thought to  be  immune-mediated from infection,  para-infectious 
processes,  autoimmune disease,  or  para neoplastic processes.  The exact  mechanism  of TM  following 
immunization  is unknown. 
MAH's  conclusion:  from the data  identified  during  the  reporting period and  taking  into account  the 
cumulative  experience,  there  is  currently  insufficient  evidence  of a causal  association between Transverse 
myelitis  and  VAXZEVRIA.  It is AstraZeneca's opinion  that  no changes  to  the  VAXZEVRIA CDS (i. e.  Section 
4. 4  currently  warnings  on  Neurological events)  and  RMP are  warranted  based  on  the  review of currently 
available  information.  Surveillance  of Transverse  Myelitis  will continue  to  be  closely  monitored  as  part  of 
AstraZeneca's  ongoing  surveillance  efforts  for the  important potential risk of  Nervous system disorders, 
including  immune-mediated  neurological conditions. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
The  MAH provided a review of interval cases  of transverse myelitis,  including a  BCC classification and 
causality assessment according  to the WHO-UMC.  Out of 112 interval cases, 22 cases  fulfilled BC  Level 
PRAC  PSUR assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  46/123 
2-3  criteria  (no  BCC  level 1  case),  among  which 19 were assessed as  possibly related  (with  limited 
information  [15] or with confounders  [4]).  When available,  CSF results  were presented.  It was  shown that 
information was either limited or the  CSF  picture  including  anti-neuronal antibodies  had a 
varied presentation  to identify  any singular  etiopathogenetic possible  role  of  Vaxzevria.  However,  data 
remained  very  limited  precluding  any definitive conclusion  at  this  stage. 
The updated O/E  analyses  provide  similar results  compared  to  those  presented  in  the  previous  PBRER. 
The literature review  performed  by  the  MAH identified 1  article  that did not raise  any  new safety concern. 
In conclusion,  updated review of  PM  data,  O/E analysis  and  literature did not  provide any  new  significant 
data.  As  previously  discussed,  the  PRAC  Rapporteur considers that a causal  relationship  between 
Vaxzevria  and Transverse  Myelitis  is  at least a reasonable  possibility  (disagreement with the 
MAH's  opinion).  The  risk of  transverse  myelitis  is  considered  to  be appropriately  described  in the 
current EU-PI  (Warning in section  4.4;  TM  listed in section  4.8).  Moreover,  TM  will continue to  be 
closely  monitored as part  of the  surveillance  of the  important  potential  risk of  Nervous  system  disorders, 
including  immune-mediated  neurological conditions.  This  includes routine  PhV  and  PASS. 
2.3.7.3.  Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis  (ADEM) 
Please note  that ADEM  data  is  not  reproduced here  (Section  1 5. 2. 1 2  of the PBRER). 
MAH's summary 
On  review  of  AstraZeneca's Global  Safety  Database cumulatively  to 28  June 2022,  a total  of 80 cases 
of  ADEM  with the  use  of  VAXZEVRIA  have  been  received  (57  from  spontaneous  sources).  This  includes 
37  interval  cases.  All of the  reported  cases  were  serious,  including 56  (70%)  medically  confirmed  cases.

Age/Gender: The age range was  22  to 90 years with a median of 53 years;  within the  age range (19 to 
61  years) mentioned by  Schwarz  et  al 2001.  43  (54%) cases were reported in female  vaccinees. 
Seriousness/Outcome:  In 46  (57. 5%) cases,  ADEM  was reported to cause hospitalization,  and  in 45 
(56. 3% ) cases  ADEM  was  considered a  medically  important event.  In  27  (33. 8%) cases  the  events  had a 
favourable  outcome  (recovering/resolving/resolved). 
Five  (5;  6. 3%) cases  had a fatal  outcome.  In  the 5  fatal cases,  the WHO-UMC causality  was  considered 
as " Possible" with limited  information in 1 case, " Possible" with confounders  in  1 case, 
"Unlikely"  in 2  cases,  and "Unassessable" in 1  case.  Two  (2)  cases  met  BCC  level 2  and 1 case met  BCC 
level 1.  No significant  safety concerns were  seen  on  review of ADEM cases with fatal outcome.  In 25 
(31. 3% ) cases the outcome was  not recovered.  The case fatality rate of 6.3%  is  in  line with  previously 
document case  fatality  rates  in ADEM  (5%  to  50%;  Borlot  et al  2011). 
ITO: The median TTO was  8  days  [ITO reported in  50  (62. 5%) cases] 
BCC criteria and  causality assessment{WHO-UCM criteria 7: 3  (3. 8%) cases  fulfilled BCC level 1 ,  26 
(32. 5%) fulfilled BCC level 2,  5  (6. 3%) fulfilled BCC level 3  of the diagnostic criteria for certainty. 
Of the 3 cases  fulfilling  BCC level 1,  2 cases  were  assessed  as "Possible" with limited information  and 1 
case  was  assessed as "Unlikely"  per the WHO  UMC causality  assessment criteria. 
On  review of the 56  (70%)  medically confirmed cases,  25  (44. 6%) cases  met  BCC  level 1  to 3  and  the 
WHO-UMC  causality was  assessed  as "Possible" with  confounders  in  12  (48%) cases,  " Possible" 
with limited information in  6  (24% )  cases and "Unlikely" in 4  (16% )  cases.  The  remaining 3  cases 
PRAC PSUR assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  47 /123 
(12%) had  insufficient case details  for  a comprehensive causal  assessment. 
Pre-clinical/Clinical  studies:  no  events  of Acute  disseminated  encephalomyelitis. 
O/E  analysis  (Tables  1 40-144 of PBRER):  the  O/A  analysis  of all ADEM  cases  suggested  that overall,  the 
observed numbers  were significantly less than  the  expected  numbers in  the 42-day risk  windows. 
The  observed  numbers were greater than  expected  in  a few sub group stratifications  and may  be 
explained  by  reporting  bias  for  increased  reporting  of cases  with a shorter risk window for the  passive 
event reporting  of rare  diseases.  Review of cases  in  these  subgroups  where  observed  numbers  were 
above  expected showed  that  most cases had  insufficient  information to  make  any causality assessment. 
EVDAS ROR:  On  review of the PT 'Acute  disseminated  encephalomyelitis'  in  EudraVigilance database,  it 
exceeded the disproportionality  assessment  threshold.  ADEM  is a rare  and  serious event  and  when this 
event  is  compared  against  the drugs  in  EVDAS,  especially  in  the context  of  global rollout  of COVID-19 
vaccines,  it  is  expected to show a  disproportionality.  Therefore,  this  finding  is  not considered significant. 
Trend  analysis over  time:  The  analysis  identified a peak in reporting in  Mar/Apr and  Nov/Dec  2021,  which 
may  be  due  to  the  prevalence  of  COVID-19  infection  in  the community  as  it coincided with  COVID-19 
pandemic peaks  rather  than  with vaccine  exposure.  AstraZeneca  does  not consider the  trend analysis  to 
be suggestive  of increased risk  due  to  VAXZEVRIA. 
Mechanism: The  review of  mechanism  of action  articles  and case  reports  found  no  conclusive  evidence 
linking proof of  mechanism  in  either a mechanism-based study  or further exploration  of  mechanism  in  the 
same case  were  identified.  No new safety  signals  were  identified  from  review  of literature. 
MAH's conclusion 
AstraZeneca's  review of the  cases  in  the  safety database,  O/E analysis,  clinical  and  pre-clinical  databases, 
literature  and  external  databases does  not  bring  any new information  that  will alter the  current  benefit­
risk  profile  for the event ADEM  in  association  with  VAXZEVRIA.  As  is  already stated  in  Section 4. 4  of the 
CDS that  neurological  events,  which  includes  demyelinating  disorders such as  Guillain-Barre  Syndrome 
(GBS),  are  very  rare  events  reported following vaccination  with VAXZEVRIA.  A  causal  relationship has  not 
been  established.  As with other  vaccines,  the  benefits  and  potential  risks of  vaccinating  individuals  with 
VAXZEVRIA  should  be  considered.  Therefore,  AstraZeneca considers  that  no updates  to CDS  or RMP are 
required. 
ADEM will continue  to  be  closely monitored as  part  of AstraZeneca's ongoing surveillance efforts for the 
important potential risk of nervous system disorders,  including  immune-mediated neurological conditions. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
The  MAH provided an updated cumulative review of cases  of ADEM,  including a  BCC  classification and 
causality assessment according  to the WHO-UMC.  Cumulatively,  80 serious cases of ADEM,  including 
56  medically confirmed cases,  have  been  identified.  About 46%  if the  cases  have  been  reported from the 
interval  period. 
Review of the  cases:  Compared  to the  information  available  in  the previous  PSUR,  14  papers  including 
23  cases  of ADEM  were  published  in  the literature  (i. e.  12 in 2022 and 2  in  2021).  These  include  several 
well  documented cases,  among  which 3 cases classified with a BCC  level  1  by  the  MAH:

T he  MAH classified  the  case  a s  BCC Level 1 with a causality 
assessment o f  possible 
with limited 
information (see  T a ble  1 3 3  of 
PBRER). 
Overall,  the  PRAC  Rapporteur agrees  with the BCC classification  level  1 for the 3 cases,  (i. e.  absence 
of recurrence/relapse  of illness  was  observed up to 3  months,  and  in  the fatal  case,  ADEM diagnosis  was 
confirmed by  ante-mortem  biopsy  and  autopsy).  Regarding  the  causality  assessment: 
- the fatal  case 
suggests a possible causal association  (i. e.  plausible TTO, 
exclusion  of  some  alternate  causes,  patient  with  several  co-morbidities and poly-medicated)  and, 
- the 2  other  cases 
suggest  a probable causal association 
(i. e.  plausible TTO,  extensive  work-up to exclude  other  possible  causes,  patients  without  any  familiar and 
personal history  of neurological diseases or previously asymptomatic) 
In addition  to  this,  26 case  of BCC  level 2  were  identified by the MAH,  including 22 cases  assessed  as 
with  a possible causal relationship  as  they  occurred  within  the  risk  period of 2-42  days.  Most  of  the 
possible  cases  were  considered  with  limited information  (n= 16)  and confounders/alternate  possible 
explanations  could be identified in 6  cases.  However,  most of the cases  were from  the  literature  (n= 16) 
and include  several well  documented reports  (see Table  134  of  PBRER). 
For  example,  6 cases from the EU  were published  and are assessed by  the  PRAC  Rapporteur with an 
at least a  possible causal association  with Vaxzevria:

Clinical pattern:  Overall,  the analysis of  PM cases did  not identify  any particular clinical pattern for 
cases  that  occurred  after  Vaxzevria  vaccination.  Some  cases  were associated  with positive  MOG-antibody, 
whereas  other cases were  not. 
O/E analysis:  the updated  analyses  provide  similar  results  to those  presented  in  the  previous  PBRER. 
Briefly,  the  O/E analysis using  BCC  Level 1-3 cases did  not yield a ratio significantly greater than  1  for 
any  of the risk windows  (14  days,  30  days,  42  days),  nor for the different stratifications  (i. e. 
age/gender/region). 
ROR analysis in EVDAS:  a disproportionality reporting if ADEM was  observed  with  Vaxzevria  (i. e.  ROR 
of 1. 06).  Of note,  in  an updated analysis with a O LP  of  14/10/2022,  the  PRAC Rapporteur identified a 
similar  disproportionality for  Vaxzevria  (i. e.  ROR[-] of 1,10;  ROR of  1,39;  n= 77 PT ADEM),  but also 
overall for  all  COVID-19 vaccines (i. e.  ROR[-] of  1,27;  ROR of  1,45;  n= 299  PT ADEM). 
Epidemiological  study:  at  this  stage,  no well-designed  observational  studies  assessing the  risk  of ADEM 
after Vaxzevria is available.  Netravathi et al 2022 performed an observational comparative analysis study 
in  a tertiary care  centre  in  India.  The  study consists in  a case series analysis (period from  May to  Dec 
2021)  of  patients  with different CNS demyelinating disorders presenting within 6  weeks  of vaccination 
against  COVID-19  versus  controls  (i. e.  patients  previously  diagnosed  with 1  CNS demyelination  disorder 
or  subjects  not  vaccinated  within 6  weeks  of the  demyelination).  The  authors  suggest  that demyelination 
disorders  in  vaccinees have  a  different presentation  than  in  controls  (e.g.  in  term  of  MOG-antibody 
positivity).  However,  the  study  remains  descriptive and  has  too many limitations  to allow drawing  any 
strong conclusion. 
Mechanism of action:  several  hypotheses  were made but  the  exact  mechanism  of action  remains  to be 
elucidated.

Conclusion: The  updated  review  of  PM  data,  O/E analysis  and  literature confirmed  a  potential  signal 
of ADEM after Vaxzevria.  This  is  mainly  triggered by  several well-documented cases  of  BCC  Level 1-3 
suggesting an  at  least possible causal association with Vaxzevria;  and  more  particularly 3 new cases of 
BCC  Level 1  including  one  possible  case with a fatal  outcome and 2  probable cases. 
However,  O/E analysis  remains  unconclusive  considering  its  limitations  (i. e.  cases  of  BCC  Ll-3 vs all 
cases,  risk window including 0-2  days  post  vaccination,  low number of cases  when  stratified by  age  and 
gender  etc. ). 
As  previously  stated,  ADEM  is  an  exclusion  diagnosis  which  makes  the  interpretation  of spontaneous 
reports challenging,  as  well as  the  conduct  of O/E analysis.  It should be highlighted  that  the  updated 
cumulative  review of ADEM  cases  identified 19 cases out  of 80  which fulfilled  BC level 5  criteria.  This 
means  that  ADEM  diagnosis  was  excluded  for  almost 25%  of cases reports. 
At this  stage,  more  robust  epidemiological  data  are  missing to  further  evaluate  the  association. 
In conclusion,  as  a warning related  to  Neurological  events  is  already  included  in section 4.4,  an  update  of 
the  EU-PI  is considered not  needed at  this  stage.  However,  ADEM  should continue to be carefully 
monitored. A discussion of ADEM should be  provided  in  the next  PBRER,  including  but not be 
limited to: 
(i) an  updated  cumulative  review  of cases  of ADEM, 
(ii)  an updated literature review, with  a  focus on  new relevant epidemiological studies, 
(iii) a discussion  on  the  need to update the  PI  and/or  RMP. 
Moreover, the MAH  is  requested to carefully review the evaluation  of cases of ADEM as 
discrepancies regarding  the BCC  evaluation  ( e.g. case 
classified as BCC  Level 2 
whereas a 4-month  FU suggests a monophasic  disease course) and  WHO-UMC  causality 
assessment  ( e.g.  case 
assessed as unlikely due to incorrect TIO)  have been 
noticed.

2.3.8.  Important  potential risk  - Vaccine-Associated  Enhanced  Disease 
(VAED)  /  Vaccine-Associated  Enhanced  Respiratory  Disease  (VAERD) 
Please note  that  VAED/VAERD  data is not  reproduced here  (Section  1 6. 3. 1 . 3.  of the PBRER). 
Summary of data 
Interval Period:  During  the  interval  period  covered by this  report,  555  events  from  519  cases  (278 
initial and 241  follow-up)  were  retrieved under this  AESI  concept,  which includes  Pneumonia (196), 
COVID-19 pneumonia (135),  Coagulopathy (66),  Respiratory  failure  (48),  Breakthrough COVID-19 (26), 
Acute  respiratory  failure  (23),  Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome  (20),  Pneumonitis  (19),  Organ failure 
(7),  Cytokine  storm  (4),  Autoimmune myositis  (3),  Pulmonary haemorrhage (3),  Acute  lung  injury  (1), 
Cytokine  release  syndrome  (1),  Immune-mediated myositis (1),  Mechanical ventilation (1),  Vaccine 
associated  enhanced  respiratory disease  (1). 
Among these 519 cases,  the  majority  were  from  spontaneous  sources (492,  94. 8% ),  followed by  non­
interventional studies  (14,  2. 7%),  literature  (11,  2. 1%),  and  AZ-sponsored clinical trials  (2,  0.4%).  Of 
these 519  cases,  321  cases  (299 serious  and 22  non-serious)  were medically confirmed with the  use  of 
VAXZEVRIA.  There  were  210  (40. 5%) case  reports  from  elderly  vaccinees,  274  (52. 8%) from  adult

vaccinees,  and  age  was  unknown  in 35  (6. 7% )  vaccinees.  The  outcome  of potential  VAED/VAERD  events 
was  fatal  in 136  of  the  total 519  (26. 2%) cases  reported  during  the  interval  period. 
Cumulative data: There  have  been 2139  case reports  of potential  VAED/VAERD  which  included 2238 
events.  These  events  include  Pneumonia (911),  COVID-19  pneumonia (380),  Coagulopathy  (376), 
Respiratory failure  (188),  Pneumonitis  (104),  Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome  (93),  Acute 
respiratory failure  (75),  Pulmonary  haemorrhage  (29),  Breakthrough  COVID-19  (26),  Organ  failure  (15), 
Cytokine  storm  (12),  Autoimmune myositis  (5),  Mechanical ventilation  (5),  Vaccine  associated enhanced 
disease  (5),  Immune-mediated myositis  (4),  Acute  lung  injury  (3),  Cytokine  release  syndrome  (3), 
Coronavirus  pneumonia  (1),  Cytokine  increased  (1),  SARS-CoV-2  sepsis  (1),  Vaccine associated  enhanced 
respiratory  disease  (1). 
Among  these 2139  cases,  the  majority  were  from  spontaneous  sources  (2077,  97. 1%),  followed  by  non­
interventional  studies  (30,  1.4%),  literature  (28,  1. 3%),  and  AZ-sponsored  clinical trials  (4,  0.2%).  Of 
these 2139  cases,  1044 cases  were  reported from  females  and 1052  from  males;  and  in  the  remaining 43 
cases,  gender was  unknown.  Among total  cases,  997 (941 serious  and 56 non-serious)  were medically 
confirmed cases  with the  use  of VAXZEVRIA.  There  were 839  (39. 2%) case  reports  from elderly (�65 
years  of age)  vaccinees,  1133  (53% )  from  adult  (18  - 64  years  of age)  vaccinees,  1  from a  paediatric 
vaccinee,  and  age  was  unknown  in 166  (7. 8%) vaccinees.  In 415  of the  2139  cases,  the  outcome  of 
events  was  reported  as  fatal. 
literature:  A total  of 75 (64 from  Embase  and 11  from  InsightMeme) search results  were  obtained.  Of 
these,  none  identified any  new safety  information  or discussions  of the  mechanism  of action  relevant  to 
the review of this topic. 
Summary:  On  review  of 519  cases  of VAED/VAERD  received  during  the  reporting  period,  a  majority  (459 
out  of  519,  88.4%) of  them  were  reported as  serious,  of which 299  cases  were  medically confirmed,  and 
136  out  of  519  (26. 2%) cases  reported  fatal  outcomes.  These  cases  had  insufficient  information  on dose 
latency,  medical history,  concomitant medications,  baseline medical condition prior to vaccination,  clinical 
course,  diagnostic  and  etiologic workup,  and storage and transport conditions  of the  vaccine,  which 
precluded  a  proper causal assessment.  No hypothesized mechanism/pathways have  been identified to 
date.  No new safety information on  this  topic  was  identified through the  review of the  literature. 
MAH's Conclusion 
Based  on  evaluation  of the available  data  during  this reporting period and considering the  cumulative 
experience,  there  is  insufficient  evidence of a  reasonable  possibility  of a causal  association  between 
VAED/VAERD  and VAXZEVRIA. 
In conclusion,  it  is AstraZeneca's opinion  that  no changes to the  VAXZEVRIA CDS  or RMP are  warranted 
based  on  the  review  of currently available  information. 
Since the concept  of  VAED/VAERD is  an  Important  Potential Risk and an  AESI  with  VAXZEVRIA, 
AstraZeneca  recognizes  the  need for  surveillance  and will  continue  to  closely  monitor the  reported  events 
of  VAED/VAERD. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
During the interval period covered  by  this report, 555  events from  519 cases  (278  initial and 241 
follow-up)  were  retrieved. 
Cumulatively 2139 case  reports of  potential  VAED/VAERD were  identified  (2238  events).  The 5  most 
frequent  events were  Pneumonia  (911),  COVID-19  pneumonia (380),  Coagulopathy  (376),  Respiratory 
failure  (188)  and  Pneumonitis  (104).

The  MAH concludes that  there  is  insufficient evidence of a reasonable  possibility  of a causal  association 
between VAED/VAERD and  VAXZEVRIA.  This  is  endorsed. 
The  MAH will continue to closely  monitor the  reported events  of  VAED/VAERD.  This  is noted. 
No new  safety information emerged during  the  reporting  interval. 
2.3.9.  Other identified  risks  not categorised as  important  - Reactogenicity 
For the  reporting  period,  a total  of 79137 cases  involving 218686  events  of reactogenicity  were  identified 
from the  Safety database.  Of these  79137  cases,  there  were 2481 serious and medically confirmed  initial 
cases  of reactogenic events  with VAXZEVRIA.  Of the 2481  cases,  1549 (62. 5% ) occurred in  females,  846 
(34%) in  males,  and 86  (3. 5%) were  of unknown  gender.  Of  these  2481  cases,  the distribution  of  the 
reactogenic  events  were  as  follows:  Pyrexia (1234),  Headache  (1026),  Myalgia (591),  Fatigue  (496), 
Nausea (352),  Chills  (344),  Malaise  (313),  Arthralgia (270),  Vomiting  (318),  Injection  site  pain  (53),

Cumulatively,  a total  of 501840  cases  of reactogenicity  were  identified from  the  global  safety database. 
Of these 501840 cases,  there  were 13940  serious,  medically confirmed cases  of reactogenic events  with 
VAXZEVRIA.  Of the  13940  cases,  9663  (69%) occurred  in  females,  3998  (29% )  in  males,  and 279 (2%) 
cases were of unknown gender.  Of these 13940  cases,  the distribution  of the reactogenic  events were as 
follows:  Pyrexia (6655),  Headache  (6498),  Myalgia (2909),  Fatigue  (2704),  Nausea  (2456),  Chills  (2368), 
Malaise  (1797),  Arthralgia  (1784),  Vomiting  (1777),  Injection  site  pain  (405),  Lymphadenopathy  (301), 
Injection site erythema  (71),  Injection  site  swelling (53),  Injection  site  warmth (25),  Injection  site

Reactogenicity  is  considered  appropriately described  in  the COVID-19  VACCINE  ASTRAZENECA  CDS.  A 
review  of the  safety  information  identified  during  the reporting period,  and  also taking  into  account  the 
cumulative  experience  did not  change  the current understanding  of this  topic. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
Since launch,  a total of "'1,2 million AEs  of reactogenicity  ( did  not find  this  info in current PBRER) 
were reported in 501840 cases.  These include 218686  events reported during the  period covered by this 
PSUR#3.  Serious medically confirmed cases involved mainly  women  (i. e.  69%  cases in  females vs 29%  in 
males)  and  presented  a reactogenicity profile similar to that described  in  the  Pl. 
In conclusion,  data provided  by the MAH,  as  well as found in the literature did not raise any new safety 
issue.  The  reactogenicity  profile  of  Vaxzevria is  considered  as  appropriately  described  in  the  Pl. 
Reactogenicity do not  need to  be  further  discussed  through  PBRERs  unless  significant new 
safety  information  is  identified. 
2.3.10.  Other identified risks not categorised as  important  - Tinnitus 
Please  note  that  data on  Tinnitus is not  reproduced here  (See Sections  1 5. 2. 1  and  1 6. 3. 4. 2  of the 
PBRER). 
Summary of data 
A  cumulative  search of the AstraZeneca Global  Patient  Safety  Database  through 30  April 2022  was 
conducted  for AE reports  of Tinnitus  in  association  with the use of  VAXZEVRIA. 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  53/123 
In  clinical  studies:  An  imbalance  between  VAXZEVRIA  and  placebo  is  noted  in  the  US  study 
(D8110C00001),  for  tinnitus  and  VAXZEVRIA  (28  [0. 1 % ]  versus 3  [ < 0. 1  % ]);  randomization  ratio  was 
2: 1).  Out of the 28  events  reporting Tinnitus  in  the  AZD1222  arm,  10  reported  having  the  event  resolved 
within  7  days  after  event  onset,  6  resolved after a longer time  (8-78  days),  1  was  resolving and 11 
events had  not  yet resolved at  the  time  of reporting. 
In AZ Global Safety Database:  7442 cases  reporting an  AE of Tinnitus  were  retrieved.  A majority  of 
the events  were  reported within 3  days  (65% )  and  within  7  days  (78%) after vaccination  (any  dose).  Of 
these,  12 reported  a recurrence  or worsening  (interpreted as  rechallenge),  and  of  those,  9  cases  reported 
a risk factor  or a confounding factor.  However,  due  to the recurrence and temporal relationship to both 
doses,  causality  with  VAXZEVRIA  cannot  be  excluded. 
In regards  the  AE duration,  12. 6%  of 7442 cases  reported  outcomes  of  recovered  or  recovered  with 
sequelae.  Of those  84%  of the cases  recovered within 7  days  and  occurred  within  the  reactogenicity 
period.  Of note,  66.3%  of the  total  number of cases  report  the  event as "Not recovered",  although, 
follow-up information  is  rarely  provided.  An  O/E analysis  showed  that  the  observed  events  were 
significantly less  than the expected events  for  all  age,  sex stratifications,  and  risk windows. 
The  medical/scientific  literature  review revealed  one  new case  report  with a temporal  association  with 
VAXZEVRIA,  yet an  alternative  explanation  for the  event  (glaucoma)  was  observed.  With regard  to 
mechanism  of  action  for COVID-19  vaccines  and  tinnitus,  the  authors  considered  it undetermined  and 
unconfirmed.  Though,  potential  pathophysiological  mechanisms discussed  included  molecular  mimicry, 
autoimmune  reaction,  and  anxiety- related  reaction. 
The quantitative signal searches  from external databases (EVDAS and WHO  VigiBase)  for  VAXZEVRIA  -
Tinnitus  shows disproportionate  reporting. 
literature {mechanism of action}:  Based  on  the  available  literature  (14  relevant  articles  retrieved), 
the precise  mechanism  of action  is  still not clear,  however,  some possible  mechanisms  of action  were 
proposed  by  the  authors,  such as: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
A  hypersensitivity reaction  causing  an abnormal  autoimmune  response;  mediated  by circulating 
immune complexes  or cytotoxic  vestibule-cochlear autoantibodies  which can  lead  to a localised 
inflammation  that  damages  the  inner ear microvessels,  or  a vasculitic  event with subsequent 
localised damage  to  the  cochlea.  (Ciorba  et al 2018,  Shamriz  et al 2018,  Oldstone 2014,  Ahmed  et  al 
2021,  Parrino  et  al 2021,  Garg and  Paliwal 2021,  Pisani  et al 2022  and  Di  Mauro et al 2022). 
An immunisation  anxiety-related reaction  is  also  postulated,  as  anxiety has  also  been  related to the 
severity  and  persistency  of Tinnitus.  (Elarbed  et  al 2021,  Parrino  et al  2021,  Pisani  et  al 2022,  Gold 
et al 2020). 
Molecular  mimicry,  considering  a cross  reactivity between  anti-spike  SARS-CoV-2  antibodies  and 
otologic  antigens,  plus  hepta-peptide  resemblance  between  the  coronavirus  spike  glycoprotein  and 
human  proteins.  The  anti-spike  antibodies  may  potentially  react  with  antigens anywhere  along  the 
auditory  pathway and  initiate  an  inflammatory  reaction  involving  the  tympanic  membrane,  ossicular 
chain,  cochlea,  cochlear vessels,  organ  of Corti,  etc.  (Kanduc  and Shoenfeld 2020,  Tseng et al  2021, 
Vojdani  et  al 2020,  Ahmed  et al 2021,  Pisani et al 2022,  Garg  and  Paliwal 2021,  Wichova H  et al 
2021). 
Autoimmune  inner  ear  disease also must  be  considered  in  the differential  diagnosis,  which may have 
increased  the  likelihood  of a  dysregulated  autoimmune  response,  although it  typically  differs  in 
clinical  presentation.  (Medina  et al 2022,  Parrino  et  al 2021,  Ciorba  et al  2018). 
Despite these  possible  mechanisms  of action,  the authors have  also  suggested the  review of  pre-existing 
history  of autoimmune  disorder and  anxiety  which have been  related to the  severity and  persistency  of 
Tinnitus  (Elarbed et al 2021,  Pisani  et al 2022,  Ahmed  et al 2021,  Parrino et al 2021).  This  also  includes

underlying infections,  such as  COVID-19  (Di Mauro et al 2022),  or  a history  of  glaucoma,  thrombosis,  or 
vascular  conditions  (Ahmed et al  2021). 
MAH's  comment:  AstraZeneca  acknowledges  the authors' views and  suggestions  concerning the 
mechanism  of action.  However,  any  further exploration  of the  hypothesized  mechanisms  in  mechanism­
based  studies  or  demonstration  of a conclusive  mechanism could  not be  identified  and  thereby any 
specific  mechanism  of action  for Tinnitus  following  COVID-19  vaccination  remains  speculative. 
MAH's conclusion 
Based  on  the  evaluation of currently  available  information  from various sources,  AstraZeneca considers 
that  there  is  a reasonable  possibility  of a causal association between  VAXZEVRIA and tinnitus.  VAXZEVRIA 
CDS Section 4. 8  (undesirable  effects)  is updated  to include  'Tinnitus'  during  this  reporting period  (01 July 
2022).  A  review of the  safety  information  identified  during  the  reporting period,  and also taking  into 
account  the cumulative experience  did  not change the  current understanding of this topic. 
It is AstraZeneca's opinion  that  this topic  is  adequately  described  in  the updated  VAXZEVRIA CDS and will 
no longer  discuss  it in  future  PBRERs,  unless  significant  new safety  information  arises. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
As requested by  the  PRAC  rapporteur,  the  MAH presented a discussion on relevant literature on  plausible 
mechanism  of action.  Several hypotheses  to explain the  association  have  been  suggested but  the  exact 
mechanism  of action remains  to  be  elucidated. 
An AZ Global Safety  Database search retrieved 7442 cases  (DLP 30 April  2022)  reporting an  AE of 
Tinnitus.  A majority  of the  events  were  reported within 3 days  (65% )  and  within  7  days  (78% )  after 
vaccination  (any  dose).  Of these,  12  cases  reported a recurrence  or worsening  (interpreted  as 
rechallenge),  and of those,  9 cases  reported  a risk factor  or a confounding factor.  However,  due  to the 
recurrence  and  temporal  relationship  to  both  doses,  it is  likely related with  Vaxzevria. 
In regards  the  AE duration,  12. 6%  of 7442 cases  reported  outcomes  of  recovered  or  recovered  with 
sequelae.  Of those  84%  of the cases recovered within  7  days  and occurred  within  the  reactogenicity 
period.  Of note,  66.3%  of the  total  number of cases  report  the  event as "Not recovered",  although, 
follow-up information  is  rarely  provided.  An  O/E analysis  showed  that  the  observed  events  were 
significantly less  than the expected events  for  all  age,  sex stratifications,  and  risk windows. 
Tinnitus  is  appropriately  described  in  the Section 4. 8  of  EU-SmPC.  The  MAH  will  no  longer  discuss  it 
in  future  PBRERs,  unless  significant  new  safety  information  arises.  This  is  endorsed 
2.3.11.  Other identified risks  not  categorised  as  important  - Hypoaesthesia 
and  Paraesthesia 
Please  note  that  data on Hypoaesthesia and Paraesthesia is not  reproduced here  (see Section  1 6. 3. 4. 3  of 
the PBRER). 
MAH's Conclusion 
Based  on  the  evaluation  of currently  available  information  from all  available  sources,  with  particular focus 
on  post-market  data,  AstraZeneca considers  that  there  is  a reasonable  possibility  of a causal  association 
between VAXZEVRIA  and  hypoaesthesia and paraesthesia.  Many of these events were co-reported with 
reactogenicity  events.  The  information  regarding hypoaesthesia  and  paraesthesia were  added  to the  CDS 
and the company  will continue  to conduct  routine  pharmacovigilance  activities on  this safety  topic. 
Hypoaesthesia  and  Paraesthesia are considered  appropriately described  in  the  VAXZEVRIA CDS (Section 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  5 5/123 
4. 8).  A  review of the  safety  information  identified  during  the  reporting period,  and also taking  into 
account  the cumulative experience  did  not change the  current understanding of this topic. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
A  cumulative search of the AstraZeneca Safety Database (data cut-off:  12  December 2021)  retrieved 
10,736 cases  reporting an  AE with a PT of hypoaesthesia  (19%  medically confirmed reports,  50% 
serious  events).  Approximately 48%  of the events  had  an  outcome  of recovered,  recovered with 
sequelae,  or were recovering.  Duration  of the  events was  not  presented.  Of the 10,736 cases that 
reported hypoaesthesia,  1019  (9. 5%) reported hypoaesthesia  as  a solo  event. 
The  search retrieved 17,721  cases  reporting an  AE with a PT of paraesthesia  (16%  medically 
confirmed reports,  43%  serious events).  For  events  with  known TTO,  the  majority  (65% ) occurred on  the 
same day  or within 1-3 days  following  vaccination.  Approximately 45%  of the events had  an  outcome  of 
recovered,  recovered with sequelae,  or were recovering.  Duration  of the  events  was  not  presented.  Of the 
17, 721 cases that  reported paraesthesia,  2030  ( 11. 5% )  reported  paraesthesia  as  a solo event. 
This signal was already described and assessed in the  previous  PBRER AR as  late breaking 
information and section  4.8 was modified accordingly  following  this assessment. This  was 
endorsed in the  previous  PRAC meeting. 
Paraesthesia/ Hypoaesthesia do not need to be  further discussed through  PBRERs  unless 
significant new  safety information  is  identified. 
2.3.12.  Other  potential risks not categorised  as  important  - AESI 
The AESis for the COVID-19 VACCINE ASTRAZENECA and associated  PTs are listed  in Appendix 7  of the 
PSUR.  AESis  have  been included for  review  in  Section 16. 3  and  Appendix  8  of the  PSUR (O/E Analyses).

Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
The following AESI had a Observed significantly  >  Expected :  Anaphylaxis  type reactions,  Angioedema -
Hypersensitivity,  GBS and  Acute  disseminated encephalomyelitis.  These events,  with the  except of ADEM, 
are  included  in  Section 4. 8  of the  EU-SmPC.  ADEM  is discussed in 2. 3. 7. 3  of this  AR. 
No new  safety concerns were identified. 
2.3.13.  Missing information  - Use  of  COVID- 19  VACCIN E  ASTRAZ EN ECA in 
pregnant  and  breastfeeding  women  /  Use  during  pregnancy and while 
breastfeeding 
Please  note  that  data on  Use in  pregnant  and breastfeeding  women / Use  during pregnancy and  while 
breastfeeding is not  reproduced here  (Section  1 6. 3. 5. 1  of the PBRER). 
MAH's conclusion on  Use of AZD1222 in pregnant  women 
In summary,  the cumulative and periodic review up until 28 June 2022  of all reports  of exposure to 
VAXZEVRIA  during pregnancy did  not identify  any  new  safety concerns for the  mother or the babies.  The 
reported adverse  events  are  similar  between  the  pregnant and non-pregnant populations. 
The results of the O/E analyses  for  spontaneous  abortion  (UK reports)  suggest  that  observed cases  are 
less than would be  expected  in  the  unvaccinated pregnant  women. 
Based  on  these  interval  and  cumulative  reviews  of the  currently  available  data,  it  is  AstraZeneca's  opinion 
that  no  updates  to  product  labelling  or  RMP  are warranted.  Use  of  VAXZEVRIA  during pregnancy  remains 
as  Missing  information  for the  product  and  is  closely monitored. 
MAH's conclusion on  Use of AZD1222 in  Breastfeeding women 
From the data  identified  during  the  reporting period,  and also taking  into account the cumulative 
experience,  there  is  no new safety  information  or  a safety  concern  identified with the  exposure  to 
VAXZEVRIA  during pregnancy or  breast  feeding.  Use of  VAXZEVRIA  in pregnant and breastfeeding women 
/  Use during  pregnancy  and  while  breastfeeding will continue  to  be  considered  missing information  for 
VAXZEVRIA. 
Use  of  VAXZEVRIA  in  pregnant  and  breastfeeding  women /  Use  during pregnancy  and while  breastfeeding 
will  be  primarily  investigated  in  the ongoing  non-interventional  pregnancy registry  study  (D8110C00003) 
of women  exposed to VAXZEVRIA immediately  before or  during pregnancy as part  of the  C-VIPER 
Registry Consortium.  Refer to  Appendix 4  for additional details. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
During the reporting period,  of the total of 1403  pregnancy  case reports,  there  were 131  cases  of 
spontaneous abortion  (SAB),  3  cases  of abortion  missed,  42 case  reports  with abnormal  neonatal 
outcome,  4  case  reports  of stillbirth,  29  case  reports of  premature babies,  10 case  reports  of foetal death, 
5  case  reports  of sudden  infant death  syndrome,  13 case  reports  with  breech  presentation,  and 3  case 
reports  of ectopic pregnancy.  Pregnancy  outcome  was  not available  for the  majority  of cases. 
A  total  of 131  pregnancy cases  resulted  in  spontaneous  abortion,  of which 83%  (109  out  of 131) 
were reports from consumers and 17%  (22 out  of 131)  of the reports were medically confirmed,  with 
71 %  of the reports being from the  UK.  O/E analysis showed that spontaneous  abortions  were 
significantly lower than  expected. 
PRAC  PSUR assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  57 /123 
Of the 1403  pregnancy  cases,  1096 cases  had  reported AEs  in  both  mothers  and  infants.  Most  of the 
AEs  reported  in  these  cases  were  known  reactogenicity  events  (Headache,  Pyrexia,  Fatigue,  Chills, 
Myalgia,  Nausea,  Pain  in  extremity  and  Arthralgia).  There  were 82 cases  with 218  AEs  that  occurred  in 
the pediatric  population,  with the top 3 AEs being:  Foetal exposure  during  pregnancy  (50),  Exposure  via 
breast  milk  (22)  and COVID-19  (10). 
During the  interval  period,  there were 32 reports  pertaining to  infant exposure  to VAXZEVRIA during 
breastfeeding.  Overall,  3  cases  were serious  (of which 1  was  medically confirmed).  Within these 32 
reports,  (3  serious,  29  non-serious)  there  were 68  events  in  infants  following  breastfeeding.  Of these 68 
events,  9 were  serious  adverse events.  Most frequent reported PT was  Pyrexia. 
From the data  identified during  the reporting  period,  and also taking  into  account the 
cumulative experience,  no causal relationship  could  be  established between adverse maternal 
and foetal  outcomes  and VAXZEVRIA.  No safety concerns arise from  exposure to breast 
feeding.  This  is  endorsed. 
2.3.14.  Missing information  - Use  of  COVID- 19  VACCIN E  ASTRAZ EN ECA in 
subjects with severe  immunodeficiency /  Use in  immunocompromised 
patients 
Please  note  that  data on  Use in  subjects  with  severe immunodeficiency / immunocompromised patients is 
not  reproduced here (Section 1 6. 3. 5. 2  and  1 6.4.3.2 of the PBRER). 
MAH's summary 
In total,  14,928  cases  subjects  with  severe  immunodeficiency and immunocompromised  patients were  in 
included in  the AstraZeneca's post-marketing database,  and 936  for the reporting  period.  Cases were 
assessed by  age,  sex,  type  of  event,  and  outcome. 
Cumulatively 120  cases  had a fatal  outcome,  (22  were reported  in  interval  period) and 1109  were 
hospitalised.  There  were 249  COVID-19  reports  cumulatively,  however many did not  have  sufficient 
information  for  complete  assessment. 
The review and  analysis  of the  available  literature did not highlight  any particular  safety concerns  with 
VAXZEVRIA  when  used  in  immunocompromised patients.  There  were  no articles  identified with a specific 
reference to  any  new safety concerns  associated  with VAXZEVRIA. 
In summary,  the  review of available data  from spontaneous reports  regarding  subjects  with severe 
immunodeficiency  and  in  immunocompromised patient' s  did not identify  an  index case  or  other evidence 
of a new or emerging signal. 
MAH's conclusion 
This  cumulative and  periodic review of the  Use  of  VAXZEVRIA  in subjects with severe 
immunodeficiency/Use  in immunocompromised patients did not indicate  any new safety  concerns. 
Overall,  the  review of the  currently available  data did not reveal any  new safety  information  in  immune­
compromised  individuals  that  has not  been  identified  in  the  overall  population. 
Use  of  VAXZEVRIA  in  subjects  with severe  immunodeficiency/Use  in  immunocompromised  patients  will  be 
investigated  primarily  in the ongoing  non-interventional  post-marketing  observational study using 
existing secondary  health  data sources  (D8110R00002  [US] and  D8111R00006  [EU/UK])  study  of 
subgroups  exposed to AZD1222.  Refer to  Appendix 4 for  additional  details. 
AstraZeneca will continue  to  monitor  safety  information  in  vaccinees  with severe  immunodeficiency  and  in 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  58/123 
immunocompromised  patients as  part  of the  routine  safety  surveillance  activities  for  VAXZEVRIA  and  take 
further actions  as  deemed appropriate. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
The review of the  cases did not bring new safety  information.  An imbalance of cases spontaneously 
reported in  women  was  previously  observed  and  is  confirmed  with 73%  of reports  in  females. 
The 22 deaths  (2.4%) reported  during  this  period ranged from  18 to 86  years with a  median  of 66  years, 
which is  similar to the  age pattern  observed cumulatively.  The  reported PTs with a fatal  outcome  in  order 
of frequency  (> 8)  were Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome  (16),  Cyanosis  (16), 
Dyspnoea (14),  Acute  respiratory  distress syndrome  (12),  Gangrene  (12),  Vasculitis  (12),  Psoriasis  (10), 
Psoriatic arthropathy (12). 
This  list  differs from  the  same  list  of PTs reported cumulatively,  in which the  most frequently reported PTs 
were  Death (26),  Headache  (23),  Dyspnoea  (20),  Immune thrombocytopenia  (16), 
Thrombocytopenia  (16),  Cardiac  arrest  (15),  Malaise  (14),  Cerebrovascular  accident  (12),  Circulatory 
collapse  (12),  COVID-19  (11),  Myocardial infarction  (11),  Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis  (10), 
Photophobia  (10),  Pneumonia (10),  Cerebral haemorrhage (9),  Hemiplegia (9),  Seizure  (9),  Vomiting  (9). 
In the next  PSUR,  the  MAH should verify the  PTs reported  in  fatal  cases,  especially regarding 
TTS and Thrombocytopenia.  [Request for the  next  PSUR] 
A  search in  the literature  identified 5  relevant articles: 
- Benning et al  showed  impaired neutralization  against  emerging variants  in  kidney transplant  recipients 
after a two-dose  vaccination  using  Vaxzevria,  mRNA  vaccine,  or both.  The  authors concluded that 
additional vaccination  was  necessary  in  these patients; 
- Callagen  et al.  studied vaccine  effectiveness  in  solid organ  transplant (SOT) recipients  and  found a 
31 %  reduction  in risk of  death with 2 doses  of  Vaxzevria compared with unvaccinated  individuals; 
- Neagoie et al.  found  that 66%  of patients  in  a cohort of allogenic transplanted  patients  showed  a 
humoral response.  The  incidence of  positive  serology was  lower in  patients  who  underwent  the 
vaccination  within the first 18  months after allo-SCT; 
- Osei-Boadu et al.  studied  side effects  of the  vaccines (Comirnaty  and  Vaxzevria)  and  flare up of 
arthritis  or underlying  autoimmune  condition  in 532  patients.  Fifteen  patients  reported arthritis  flare; 
- Whitaker et al.  found a reduced  antibody  response  and  vaccine  effectiveness  after  a second  dose  of 
COVID-19  vaccine  with no  statistical  difference  between Comirnaty  and  Vaxzevria  (around 60%  VE for 
both vaccines). 
In conclusion,  the  review of  pharmacovigilance data  and  literature  did not identify new safety  concerns  in 
subjects  with  severe  immunodeficiency.  The efficacy of the vaccine  in  this  population  is uncertain and 
alternate  protective measures  should  be  maintained. 
2.3.15.  Missing information  ( EU-specific)  - Use  in  patients with  autoimmune 
or  inflammatory  disorders 
Please note  that  data  on  Use in  patients  with  autoimmune  or inflammatory  disorders  is not  reproduced 
here  (Appendix  R3  - Section 2.3. 1  of the PBRER). 
Summary  of  data 
A  search in  the MAH's Global Safety  database  identified  a cumulative  total  of 21,591 reports  in 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  59/123 
individuals with underlying  autoimmune  or  inflammatory disorders  (1,996  during  the  reporting  period). 
There were 77%  of the  cases  reported  in  females.  There  were 190  (0. 9%) cases with fatal  outcome. 
Of the  21,591  reports,  218  (1%)  cases  involved 222 events  of exacerbation/flares  of the  underlying 
condition.  Adverse  events  included:  Ankylosing  spondylitis  (4),  Autoimmune  disorder  (3),  Autoimmune 
haemolytic  anaemia  (1),  Colitis  ulcerative  (8),  Crohn's  disease  (21),  Cryoglobulinaemia  (1),  Henoch­
Schonlein  purpura  (1),  Inflammatory  bowel  disease  (1),  Juvenile  idiopathic arthritis  (1),  Multiple  sclerosis 
(6),  Multiple sclerosis  relapse  (30),  Myasthenia gravis  (2),  Polymyalgia rheumatica  (2),  Psoriasis 
(50),  Psoriatic arthropathy (1),  Raynaud' s  phenomenon  (2),  Rheumatoid arthritis  (74),  Sarcoidosis (1), 
Still' s  disease  (3),  Systemic lupus erythematosus  (9),  and  Vasculitis  (1). 
In 33  cases  (2  in  the reporting period),  the vaccinees considered their current flare out  of pattern mainly 
because they had  not had a flare  in  a long  time  prior to the vaccine or considered their autoimmune 
disease  to be  well-controlled.  There  was  insufficient  information  to exclude  alternative  aetiologies. 
The  MAH did not  provide  information  from  the  literature 
MAH's  conclusion 
From the data  identified  during  the  interval  and  cumulative  periods,  an  increased risk of 
exacerbation/flares  of the  underlying disease  following  vaccination  was  not seen.  A  difference  in  the 
safety  profile  of this  population  from that  of the  general  population  was  not  seen. 
Use  of  VAXZEVRIA  in  patients  with  autoimmune  and/or  inflammatory  disorders  will  continue  to  be 
considered  as  Missing  Information  in  the  EU Risk  Management  Plan  and monitored  as part  of surveillance 
activities  for VAXZEVRIA. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
A  search in  the MAH safety database identified 21,591 cumulative  cases,  including 1,996  cases during 
the reporting period.  The  review of these  new cases  did  not  bring  new safety  information. 
The  proportion  of cases  in  individuals  with  autoimmune  or  inflammatory  underlying  condition  and 
reporting  a flare  of their condition remains small  (1 %).  In some cases,  the  role  of the vaccine  cannot  be 
excluded. 
No information  from the  literature  was  provided.  In  the  previous  PSUR,  the  MAH identified 15 articles 
about  safety  in  patients with autoimmune  or  inflammatory  underlying condition,  but none  was  specific to 
Vaxzevria. 
No new important safety information came  from the  review of these  cases. 
2.3.16.  Missing information  - Use  of  COVID- 19  VACCIN E  ASTRAZ EN ECA in 
subjects with severe  and  /  or  uncontrolled underlying disease / Use in frail 
patients  with  co-morbidities  (eg,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease 
[COPD], dia betes,  chronic  neurological disease,  cardiovascular disorder) 
The MAH provided a  cumulative review in individuals identified as having severe and/or  uncontrolled 
underlying disease or  were identified as frail" - see section  1 6. 3. 5. 3  of the PBRER. 
MAH's Conclusion 
This  review  of the  cumulative  and  periodic data  in  individuals  with frailty,  severe  and/or uncontrolled 
underlying  disease  and  comorbidities did not  revile any  new safety  concern.  There  was  no increase  in 
events  seriousness  (for  all  discussed  topics)  or severity.  In the subjects  with supplemental oxygen use 
PRAC PSUR assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  60/123 
there  was  2  fold increase  in  the number of the  fatal cases  reported  in  (5. 3%) (9. 7% )  the  current  interval 
period  (77  vs.  35  respectively)  as  compared to the  previous  PBRER.  This  was  due  to increased  severity  of 
underlying acute  or chronic  hypoxemia causing detrimental  decrease  in  oxygen  saturation  in  patients  with 
uncontrolled  pulmonary  infection,  COPD,  bronchitis,  congestive  heart  failure,  and Covid-19. 
Out  of the  77 fatal  cases  reported  during  the  reporting  interval,  35  were follow-up reports.  Of note,  out  of 
the 42  new reports  received  by  AstraZeneca during  the  reporting interval,  31  cases had  the  onset date  at 
an  earlier  point  during  2021  before  the  start  of  the  reporting  interval,  however,  were  not  reported  to 
AstraZeneca  until  later.  Therefore,  this  increase  could  possibly  be  explained by reporting  backlog  for 
some  markets. 
In summary,  no abnormal  trends  or significant new safety  concerns  were  identified  in  the  interval  period 
with respect to the  cumulative  data.  Majority of the adverse events  reported  in  patients with  frailty 
and/or uncontrolled underlying  disease  were either related  or heavily confounded by  patients'  medical 
history  and  underlying  disorders  or were consistent  with the known  safety profile  of the  vaccine. 
This  cumulative and  periodic review of currently  available data  from  the  use  of  VAXZEVRIA  in  subjects 
with frailty,  severe  and/or uncontrolled  underlying  diseases  and  comorbidities  did  not identify  any new 
safety concerns. 
This  topic will continue  to  be  considered  missing information and  will  be kept under close surveillance by 
AstraZeneca. 
Use  of  VAXZEVRIA  in  subjects  with severe  or uncontrolled underlying  disease/Use  in  frail  patients  will  be 
investigated  primarily  in  the  ongoing  non-interventional  post-marketing  observational  study  using 
existing secondary  health  data sources  (D811110R00002  [US] and  D8111R00006  [EU/UK])  study  of 
subgroups  exposed to  VAXZEVRIA.  Refer to Appendix 4  for  additional  details. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
This  review presented the cumulative and  periodic data  in individuals identified as having severe and/or 
uncontrolled underlying disease or were identified as  frail for the following categories. 
Frailty:  Cumulatively,  768 cases  were  identified,  out of which  majority  (77. 7% )  were  reported in

important  (294),  disability  (109),  hospitalization  (65),  life threatening  (26),  and  death  (88). 
Hip  Fracture:  Cumulatively,  26  cases  were reported,  Of the 26  cases,  76.9%  (20 cases)  were reported 
in  females and 23. 1 %  (6  cases)  were  in males.  Age  ranged  from 18 years to  < 65  years  in 34. 6%  of the 
reports,  65+ years  in 65. 4%. 
Cachexia:  Cumulatively,  198  cases  were reported,  148  (74. 7% )  were  serious,  reported  seriousness

Bladder  Incontinence:  Cumulatively,  4584  cases were reported:  67.6%  (3097)  in  females,  30. 2% 
(1385)  in  males  and gender was  not  reported  in  the remaining 2.2%  (100)  of  cases.  Age  ranged  from  0 
to  < 18  years  in 0. 1%  (3)  of the  reports;  18 to  < 65  years  in 65. 7%  (3011)  cases,  65+  years  in 25.6% 
(1172) and age was not reported  in the remaining 7.9%  (361)  of cases.  The age  group  of adolescent, 
adult and  elderly  and  foetus  (age  was  not  specified) was  reported for 0.8%  (37) cases.  The  majority  of 
reports  (82. 2%) were from consumers  with the  remaining 17.8%  being  medically  confirmed. 
Dementia:  Cumulatively,  2802 cases  were reported,  2088  (74. 5% )  were serious,  reported seriousness 
criteria were  medically  important  (1440),  disability  (549),  hospitalization (634),  life threatening  (214), 
and death (183).  ,  The  remaining 714  (25. 5% )  reports  were  non  serious.

Long  term  Frailty:  Cumulatively,  789  cases  were  reported,  704  (89. 2% )  were  serious,  reported 
seriousness  criteria were medically  important  (513),  disability  (160),  hospitalization  (221),  life 
threatening  (82),  and death (59).  ,  The remaining 85 (10. 8%) reports were  non serious. 
Metastatic Cancer:  Cumulatively,  789 cases  were reported,  704  (89. 2% )  were  serious,  reported 
seriousness  criteria were medically  important  (513),  disability  (160),  hospitalization  (221),  life 
threatening  (82),  and death (59). 
Supplemental  Oxygen  Use:  Cumulatively,  2987 cases were  reported,  2198  (73. 6%) were serious, 
reported seriousness criteria were  medically important (1378),  disability (265),  hospitalization (1000),  life 
threatening  (320),  and death (251).  The  remaining 789  (26. 4%) cases  were non serious. 
Palliative  Care:  Cumulatively,  105  cases  were  reported,  102 (97 . 1  % ) were  serious,  reported 
seriousness  criteria were medically  important  (58),  disability  (17),  hospitalization (47),  life threatening 
(9),  death  (30). 
Pressure  Ulcers:  Cumulatively,  3966 cases  were  reported,  2287  (57. 7% )  were serious,  reported 
seriousness  criteria were medically  important  (1869),  disability  (315),  hospitalization (364),  life 
threatening  (91),  and death (57).  The remaining 1679 (42. 3% ) cases  were  non serious. 
No abnormal trends or  significant new safety concerns were  identified  in  the  interval  period with respect 
to the cumulative data.  Majority  of the  adverse  events  reported in patients  with frailty  and/or 
uncontrolled underlying  disease were  either related or heavily confounded  by  patients' medical history 
and underlying disorders. 
No new important safety  information  came  from the  review of these cases. 
2.3.17.  Missing information  - 16.3.5.4  Use  of  COVID- 19  VACCIN E  
ASTRAZ EN ECA with  other  vaccines  /  Interactions  with  other  vaccines 
Please  note  that  data on  co-administration  is not  reproduced here  (Section  1 6. 3. 5. 4  of the PBRER). 
A  cumulative  review of cases  reporting  AEs  after  vaccination  with VAXZEVRIA  with other vaccines, 
including seasonal  Influenza  vaccine,  Herpes vaccines,  Pneumococcal  vaccine  and  Varicella  vaccine was 
undertaken. 
Co-administration with Influenza Vaccine 
Reporting interval:  1297  cases,  including 4288 AEs were identified  (86. 6%  spontaneous  cases,  13. 7% 
non-interventionaljpost-marketing  cases,  0 . 1  %  Clinical trial,  and  O. 2%  literature). 
Cumulative  search:  13185 cases,  including 56430 AEs  were  identified  (90. 3%  spontaneous cases,  9.6% 
non-interventionaljpost-marketing  cases,  0. 02%  Clinical trial,  and 0. 07%  literature). 
Co-administration with  Herpes vaccine 
Reporting interval:  2  spontaneous cases  (1  fatal  and  1  non-serious)  were  identified. 
The fatal  case 
describes  a 75-year-old female with  a  medical history  including  pleural 
effusion,  asthma,  obesity,  gallstones,  and seronegative  arthritis.  She  received the  Pneumococcal  vaccine 
on 02-0ct-2002,  herpes simplex  vaccine  on 29-OCT-2020,  dose  1  of  unknown  COVID-19  vaccine  on an 
unknown date,  dose 2 of  VAXZEVRIA  on 21-APR-2021,  and  dose  3  of  Covid-19  mRNA Vaccine  Biontech 
on  06-NOV-2021.  On 07-Nov-2021,  she  experienced events  of  COVID-19  and  Feeling hot.  On  19-Nov-
2021,  she  experienced Abdominal pain.  On  an unknown dates,  she experienced Thrombosis,  Pulmonary 
embolism,  and Chills.  On  20-Nov-2021,  she  died from the  events  of Thrombosis,  Pulmonary  embolism, 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  62/123 
COVID-19,  Chills,  Feeling hot,  and  Abdominal  pain.  An  autopsy  was  performed.  The cause  of  death was 
pulmonary  embolism  (confirmed at autopsy),  deep  vein  thrombosis  (confirmed  at autopsy)  and covid-19 
(confirmed at  autopsy).  No additional  information was  reported. 
MAH's Comment:  Current pandemic situation  of  COVID-19  and  vaccinee's  obesity  status  could be 
considered  as  a contributory risk factor  for  COVID-19  while the age  of the patient could be considered as 
contributory  to the fatality  of Thrombosis,  Pulmonary embolism and  COVID-19.  The surgical history and 
the medical history  of obesity could be considered as confounding factors  for  Pulmonary  Embolism and 
Thrombosis.  Due  to limited information  on  the baseline  health characteristics  of the patient  before 
vaccination,  circumstances  leading to the  events,  family  history  of the  patient,  possible risk factors,  and 
clinical course of  COVID-19,  the  evaluation  did not  find  evidence  to  suggest  a causal  relationship  between 
the events  and VAXZEVRIA. 
Cumulative search:  a total 3  cases,  including the  two  cases  from the  reporting interval were identified. 
Co-administration with  Pneumococcal vaccine 
Reporting interval:  110  cases,  including 305  AEs  were  identified  (99. 1 %  spontaneous cases  and 0.9% 
non-interventionaljpost-marketing  cases). 
Of  4  fatal  cases,  two  have  been  identified  as  duplicates  of each  other  and  the consolidated case  is 
detailed  below in  the  Varicella vaccine  (Reporting  interval)  section.  Of the remaining 2  fatal  cases,  one 
involved  a 73-year-old  male  with a history  of autoimmune  disorder,  hepatitis C,  and 
overweight.  He  received  VAXZEVRIA  on an  unknown date.  It  was  not reported when  he  received  the 
Pneumococcal  vaccine.  During  Aug-2021,  he  experienced  Subdural  haematoma.  On  31-Aug-2021,  he 
experienced Thrombocytopenia.  On an  unknown  dates,  he  experienced  Syncope,  Fall,  Contusion, 
Haemorrhage,  Loss of consciousness,  and  Platelet count  decreased.  He  died from  the  event  of 
Thrombocytopenia  on  31-Aug-2021.  An  autopsy was  not  performed.  The  cause  of  death was 
Thrombocytopenia. 
MAH's Comment: The  events  could  be  in  association with  each  other and  with reported  event  of Platelet 
count decreased.  Vaccinee's advanced age,  medical history of possible Diabetes mellitus  and  Autoimmune 
disorder could  be  considered as  confounding  factors  to  the events.  Due to  limited information  [ . . .  ],  the 
evaluation  did  not find  evidence  to  suggest  a causal  relationship  between  the  events  and  VAXZEVRIA. 
Cumulative  search:  387  cases,  including 1592 AEs,  were  identified  (93. 0%  spontaneous  cases,  6. 7% 
non-interventionaljpost-marketing  cases,  and  0. 3%  literature  cases). 
Co-administration with Varicella vaccine 
Reporting interval:  17 cases,  including 45  AEs,  were  identified  (100%  spontaneous  cases). 
Cumulative  search:  60 cases,  including 206  AEs,  were  identified  (93. 3%  spontaneous cases,  and 6. 7% 
non-interventionaljpost-marketing  cases). 
MAH's  conclusion 
This  cumulative and  periodic review of the  Use  of  VAXZEVRIA with other vaccines did not  indicate  any 
new safety concerns. 
Use  of  VAXZEVRIA  with other  vaccines  will continue  to  be considered  missing  information  for  VAXZEVRIA. 
Use  of  VAXZEVRIA  with other  vaccines  will  be investigated  primarily  in  the  ongoing  non-interventional 
post-marketing  observational  study  using existing secondary health  data  sources  (D811110R00002  [US] 
and D8111R00006 [EU/UK])  study  of subgroups exposed to  VAXZEVRIA. 
I Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
PRAC  PSUR assessment report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  63/123 
A  cumulative  review of cases  of concomitant administration  of  Vaxzevria with  seasonal  Influenza vaccine, 
Herpes vaccines,  Pneumococcal  vaccine and  Varicella vaccine  was  performed. 
Among the  co-administration  subset,  majority  of the  reported events  were mainly reactions  as  seen with 
Vaxzevria alone  and  are  mainly consistent with the known  Vaxzevria  safety  profile.  No increase  in 
severity/frequency has  been  described  but  this  will  be further assessed  in  the  PhV  plan. 
In conclusion,  the  review of spontaneous  data  on  co-administration  did  not reveal  any  new significant 
information.  Use  of Vaxzevria with other vaccine  will continue  to be  monitored  as  a  missing  information 
through ongoing  PASS  study. 
2.3.18.  Missing information  ( EU-specific)  - Long-term safety 
See Section 4. 3.2 and  Section 2.3.2 in Regional Appendix R3. 
There are no known risks  with a potentially  delayed  onset,  with the  exception  of the  theoretical concern 
of  VAED/VAERD.  There  is  currently  no evidence suggesting an  adverse  long-term  safety concern. 
At 6-months  follow-up from  Study  D8110C00001  the AEs observed  were  consistent with the  safety 
findings  at  the  primary  analysis.  In the  AZD1222 group,  a small  proportion  of SAEs  and  AESis  were 
reported,  with no clinically  meaningful findings.  Overall,  VAXZEVRIA  remains  well-tolerated  up  to 6 
months  post dose.  Long-term safety will  be  evaluated through follow-up in  ongoing  clinical  studies  in  the 
VAXZEVRIA  clinical  development  programme. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
This  is  endorsed. 
2.3.19.  Other safety issue  - Fatal  events 
The MAH provided an  overview  of fatal  events,  both  cumulatively  and during reporting interval.  Data  on 
fatalities is not  reproduced here  (Section 6. 3. 2  of the PBRER). 
MAH's conclusion 
From the  review of data  available during  the  reporting  period for all fatal case  reports  (including sudden 
death) and also taking  into account the  cumulative  experience  along  with the  O/E analysis  of fatal  cases 
there  is  no new safety  information  identified  on  this  topic  in  association with  VAXZEVRIA. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
Cumulatively through 29  December 2020  to 28 June 2022,  there  have  been 6399  fatal cases.  Out  of 
6399  cases,  age  of  vaccinees  was  reported  in 5352  cases  (84%) and  was  unknown  in 1047  cases  (16%). 
In 2799  (52% )  of the 5352 case reports,  the  vaccinees  were  aged 65 years and above.  The median age 
of the fatal  cases  was 65  years.  The gender distribution  as  reported  in 6117 cases  (96%) was  2780 
females  (45%)  and 3337  males  (55%). 
Cumulatively  out  of the 6399 case  reports  with fatal  outcome,  3935  (52% )  were medically confirmed  and 
2464 (48%) were consumer reports.  Cumulatively,  five  fatal  cases 
were  reported with the  booster dose,  however 
there  was  insufficient  information on  dates  of vaccination,  medical history and  cause  of  death  (the  only 
reported PT was 'death').  Of the 6399  cases,  364 (6% )  were reported  as  sudden  Death.  Case  reports  of 
sudden  Death  (see Section 6. 3. 2. 2  of the  PBRERJ ,  are included in  the  overall number of cases  with fatal 
outcome. 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  64/123 
Cumulative  O/E analyses  were  conducted  for fatal  cases,  and  were  stratified  by  age  group and  gender 
where administration data  was available.  O/E  was significantly below 1 for  all subgroups. 
Among the cases reporting fatal outcome,  no specific pattern regarding underlying conditions  or cause of 
death could be  identified.  No new  safety concerns were identified. 
2.3.20.  Other safety issue  - Lack of  efficacy 
The MAH provided an  overview  of reported  cases of Jack of efficacy.  Data  on Jack of efficacy is not 
reproduced here  (See Section 6. 3. 1  of the PBRER). 
MAH's conclusion 
Review of all the  lack  of  efficacy  reports  did  not demonstrate any  specific trend  or  safety information 
associated  with use  of  VAXZEVRIA.  The  imbalance of reporting rates during the  reporting  period and 
cumulatively  is  noted.  Of note,  95. 0%  of the  reports  (16120/16964)  during  the  reporting  interval  and 
87.5%  (19856/22705)  of the  reports  cumulatively  were  from Austria.  This  is  due  to  a local  reporting 
system where  cases  from  the  epidemiological reporting system  for  COVID-19  are  linked with the 
vaccination  passport  and  submitted  to  Eudravigilance/ AstraZeneca  in bulk. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
Given the known limits  of the vaccine effectiveness of COVID-19  VACCINE ASTRAZENECA  the reported 
cases  are  to  be expected and  do not raise  new safety concerns. 
2.3.21.  Health Authority  requests  - Hearing loss 
Please note  that  data  on Hearing Joss is not  reproduced here  (See Section  1 5.2.2.  of the PBRER). 
MAH's summary 
Sudden hearing  loss  is  known  to occur  naturally  at  an  incidence  that  increases  with age,  and  with  a range 
of acquired  and  inherited risk factors  involved  (Lin RJ et al  2012). 
Of the 1719  hearing  loss cases  reported  cumulatively  through 28 June 2022,  the TTO  was  within 28  days 
for  1078  (62. 7% )  of the  case  reports  that  reported TTO.  281  out  of  1719  cases  were  medically  confirmed. 
Underlying cause/confounding factors were  noted  in 34. 9%  of medically confirmed cases. 
Cases  were assessed by  age,  sex,  type  of  event,  and outcome.  The characteristics of the events and  of 
the  individuals with  events  were  as  expected  for the general  population,  including  the  observation of 
increased  incidence  in  the  elderly.  No unusual  trends or clusters  were  identified.  None  of the  cases  met 
WHO-UMC criteria for Certain  or  Probable/Likely. 
Of the 1719  cases,  there  were  2  fatal cases,  of which 1  case  was  medically  confirmed.  These  cases  either 
had limited information  on  the  or there  were presence  of confounders  for the  occurrence  of the  event and 
fatal  outcome. 
Review  of  medically  confirmed reports  did  not raise any  new relevant  safety  information  for  VAXZEVRIA. 
Most of the  case  reports  (196  [69. 8%]) were considered "Possible"  related to VAXZEVRIA  based  on  the 
suggestive TTO.  132  (47% )  case  reports  also  had  presence  of other risk factors/  confounders  and 64 
(22. 8%) cases  had  limited  information  for a  complete  assessment.  The  O/E analysis  results  showed 
observed  cases of hearing loss  to be significantly  less  than expected for  all  stratifications. 
From the  review of literature,  there  is  no confirmed mechanism,  pathway  or mediator identified for the 
PRAC  PSUR assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  65/123 
occurrence  of hearing loss  in  association  with  VAXZEVRIA. 
In summary,  the  review of available data  from  spontaneous  reports  regarding hearing  loss did not 
identify an  index case  or  other  evidence  of a new or  emerging signal. 
MAH's conclusion 
Based  on  the  review of the  currently  available cumulative data,  AstraZeneca considers  that  there  is 
insufficient evidence  to suggest  a causal  association between  hearing  loss and  VAXZEVRIA.  It  is 
AstraZeneca's  opinion  that  no changes  to the CDS  or RMP are  warranted  at  this  time.  Hearing loss  will 
continue  to be  monitored  as  part  of AstraZeneca's  routine  surveillance  activities  for  VAXZEVRIA. 
AstraZeneca will no longer discuss  the  topic future  PBRERs,  unless  significant new safety  information 
arises. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
As requested  by  PRAC rapporteur,  the  MAH presented an  updated  cumulative  review of all  medically 
confirmed cases  of  Hearing  loss,  including  an  age-stratified analysis.  Additionally  the  MAH  provided  a 
complete review of the  literature,  including  a  discussion  on  possible mechanism. 
Cumulative  review  (DLP 22  June 2022) 
The  MAH's  databases  search (HLT  hearing  losses)  retrieved  a total  of 1719 case  reports  (1831 events) 
of which 281(16. 83% )  were being  medically confirmed and 1324 (77. 02%) cases were  reported serious. 
Of these 1719  cases /  1831  events: 
•  Dose:  1547  (92.70/o)cases  were  reported after the  first dose;  114  (6. 8%),  4,  and 3 ,  after second 
dose,  both  doses  and  third  dose  [unknown  dose  in 50 cases]. 
Rechallenge  cases:  in 4 case  reports  (spontaneous,  medically confirmed),  the  vaccinees  experienced 
Hearing  loss after the  first dose,  and  a recurrence  or worsening with the  second dose  of vaccination. 
These  include  1  case  classified  as  BCC  Level  3  with a WHO-UMC  possible causality  with confounders.  The 
3  other cases  were classified as  BCC  Level 4  with unassessable or unlikely causality. 
•  Age/Gender: The  age  ranged from  18 to 93  years (median:  54  years).  1057  (61. 5%) cases  were 
reported  in  females. 
•  TIO:  median TTO was 3 days.  Among  the  known TTO cases;  424(34. 36%),  859(69. 61 % ),  and 1078 
(87. 35% )  cases  were reported  in  ::; 1  day,  ::; 10 days,  and  ::; 28  days,  respectively. 
•  Reported  PTs:  Among  medically  confirmed 298  events,  hypoacusis  (n= 103,  34.5%),  deafness 
(n= 69,  23. 15%),  sudden hearing  loss  (n=43,  14. 42%),  deafness  unilateral  (n= 33,  11. 07%) and 
deafness  neurosensory  (n= 28,  9. 83% )  were the most  reported  events. 
Tinnitus  (n= 595,  9. 2% )  and  headache  (n=425,  6.5%) were  the  most  common  events  that  were co­
reported in  these  cases  with  Hearing  loss. 
•  Outcome:  The  outcome was  reported in 28. 9%  (529)  events  as  Recovered  and/or Recovering,  3. 8% 
(70)  recovered with  sequelae,  not  recovered 53.2%  (975),  and 2  AEs  (0. 1% )  had a fatal  outcome 
[unknown  outcome  in 13. 9 %  (255)  events]. 
•  AE duration:  When known,  AEs duration ranged from  O  to 348  days  with a median  duration  of 
2  days;  91  (72. 8%) resolved  within  7  days  and 34  (27. 2% )  resolved  after  days. 
•  Brighton Collaboration  Classification Assessment:  Out  of the  281  medically confirmed cumulative 
case  reports,  8  (2. 8%) cases  fulfilled BCC  Level 1  criteria,  4  (1.4%) fulfilled BCC  Level  2  criteria,  6 
(2. 1%) fulfilled BCC  Level  3  criteria,  260  (92. 5%) fulfilled  BCC  Level 4  criteria and 3  (1. 1%) fulfilled  BCC 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report

Level  5  criteria. 
•  WHO-UMC  causality assessment  (for  medically confirmed cases;  n= 281):  causality  was  considered 
as  Possible for 196 cases.  Among  these,  64 cases had risk  factors/confounders  and  remaining 
132  cases  had limited  information.  WHO-UMC causality was considered  as  Unlikely and 
unassessable/unclassifiable  for 31  and 54  cases,  respectively. 
Observed  versus  expected  (0/E)  analysis 
O/E analysis parameters:  (i) background IR of Sensorineural Hearing  Loss  of 309. 86  per 100,000  persons 
per year  (Truven  Marketscan,  2019);  (ii)  OLP of 28 June 2022;  (iii)  risk window of 0-28  days;  (iv) 
stratification  by age  and gender in  the EEA,  UK,  Brazil,  and  Australia. 
Results:  observed cases  were  significantly  less than  expected  for all cases globally  and by  age  and 
gender  stratifications. 
Medical  literature  including  plausible mechanism  of action 
The  MAH  identified  and  presented  following  study  articles: 
•  A systematic  literature  review  (Pisani  et al 2022)  on  audio-vestibular events,  such as  sudden 
sensorineural hearing loss  (SSNHL),  tinnitus,  dizziness,  and  vertigo after  COVID-19  vaccination 
hypothesizes  a  possible autoimmune aetiology,  according  to  the  mechanism  of cross-reaction.  This 
hypothesis  has  been  further  corroborated  by  the  collection  of  clinical  data  on  patients.  However,  limitation 
of the  study  is  the absence  of RT-PCR testing to  rule out  COVID-19  infection. 
•  Several literature  case  reports  were  identified. 
•  Different hypotheses  for  a mechanism  of action  were  described  in  the  literature: 
Viral infection and  vascular  compromise, 
Auto-immunogenicity  (eg,  autoimmune  process  involving molecular mimicry,  bystander activation  of 
autoreactive T-cells  that  may  involve  the  vestibulocochlear  nerve) 
Biological  mechanisms  (eg,  recent findings  of the  ability  of SARS-CoV-2  to  directly  infect human 
vestibular hair  and Schwann  cells) 
Effect  of synthesis  of IgG 
However,  there  is  no confirmed  mechanism  of action for  SNHL  with VAXZEVRIA. 
Conclusion 
Overall,  the  review of cases  (cumulative,  interval  and medically confirmed)  shows a temporal relationship 
where  majority  (92. 7% )  of the  cases  reported after first  dose  and  majority  of the  events  occurred  within 
10  days  post  vaccination.  Median TTO  was  3 days  and majority  of the  cases  resolved within  7  days. 
However among 281  medically confirmed cases,  8  (2. 8%) cases  fulfilled  BCC  Level  1  criteria,  4  (1.4%) 
fulfilled BCC Level 2  criteria,  6  (2. 1 % )  fulfilled BCC Level 3  criteria.  The WHO-UMC case  causality analysis 
assessed the  majority  (69%) of the  cases  as  possibly related to  Vaxzeria.  All of these cases  either had 
confounder  or  limited  information.  In the  O/E analysis,  the  observed  cases  were  significantly  less  than 
expected  for  all cases  globally  and  by  age  and  gender stratifications.  The  review  of  scientific  literature  did 
not identify any  confirmed  mechanism  of action  of hearing  loss  in  association  with  Vaxzevria.  Therefore  it 
is  agreed with MAH that  no update  to the  PI  or RMP are  needed at  this  stage and  Hearing  loss  should 
continue  to be  monitored  as  part  of routine  surveillance process.

2.3.22.  Health Authority  requests  - Booster dosing 
Please  note  that  data on Boosting  dose is not  reproduced  here  (Section  1 5.2.3 of the PBRER). 
MAH's summary  and  conclusion 
Overall,  the  most frequently reported AEs  with  VAXZEVRIA  booster use are consistent with the  known 
safety profile  of the  vaccine,  with the  majority  of AEs being  non-serious  (68. 1 % ) .  The  majority  of unlisted 
AE  profiling was also non-serious  (56. 3%),  and  the  most  frequently reported unlisted PT was "off-label 
use" (95)  which  mostly  involved  vaccinees  receiving 3rd  dose  of  VAXZEVRIA  in  countries  where  use  of the 
vaccine  as  a  booster has  or had  not yet  been  approved,  and  the  PT "Adverse  event"  (70),  which refer to 
unspecified AEs.  On  review of unlisted clinical AEs,  no abnormal trend  was  identified cumulative till 28 
June 2022,  and  in  general  the cases  were poorly  documented  which  is  further confirmed by the  fact  that 
only  34. 6%  of all unlisted cases  were  medically  confirmed  overall,  and  additionally  only 15%  of serious 
unlisted cases  were  medically confirmed.  Although the  majority  of unlisted AESis  were serious,  there 
were  relatively  few unlisted AESis  reported  (7.9%),  and  medically confirmed  (21. 3%).  No trends  for 
AESis  were  identified when compared with the  AESis reported with primary vaccination. 
A  review  of booster reports  involving homologous and heterologous dosing with  VAXZEVRIA  within  the 
vaccination  regimen  did not  identify  any  new safety concerns.  The  nature  and  severity  of adverse  events 
reported with homologous  or heterologous  dosing did not  differ from the currently  known safety  profile  of 
VAXZEVRIA. 
It is  AstraZeneca's  opinion  that  no changes  to  the  CDS  or the Risk  Management  Plan  (RMP)  are warranted 
at  this  time.  AstraZeneca will continue  to monitor adverse  event reports  involving booster  dosing with 
VAXZEVRIA  as part of ongoing routine surveillance activities. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
Cumulatively, through 28 June 2022,  a total of 1104 reports have  been received  of confirmed 'booster' 
dosing  involving  VAXZEVRIA.  Of the  1104  reports  received,  352  (31. 9% ) were reported  as  serious  and 
472 (42. 8%) were  medically  confirmed. 
A  total  of 3741 AEs  were reported within  the  1104  reports  of  booster  dosing  with VAXZEVRIA through 28 
June 2022.  Of these 3741  AEs,  1228  (32.8%) were reported as  serious  due  to  the  AE being 
considered  as  medially  important  (974,  [79. 3%]),  the AE was  reported  to  have  resulted  in  disability  (241 
[19.6]),  required hospitalization  (262  [19. 8]),  was  life threatening  (85  [6.9]),  and/or resulted  in  death 
(40  [3. 3]). 
AE were similar for homologous and heterologous dosing. 
20  reports involving 30 adverse events reporting  a  fatal outcome  with a third booster dose  of 
VAXZEVRIA.  There  is currently  insufficient  evidence  to  suggest a reasonable  possibility  of a causal 
relationship  between  VAXZEVRIA  and  the  fatal  AEs. 
A  review of booster reports  involving homologous and heterologous dosing  with VAXZEVRIA  within 
the vaccination  regimen did  not  identify any new  safety concerns. The  nature  and  severity  of adverse 
events  reported with homologous  or heterologous  dosing  did not  differ from  the  currently  known  safety 
profile  of  VAXZEVRIA. 
It is AstraZeneca's opinion  that  no changes  to  the  CDS  or the Risk  Management  Plan  (RMP)  are  warranted 
at  this  time.  AstraZeneca will continue  to monitor adverse  event reports  involving  booster  dosing with 
VAXZEVRIA  as part of ongoing routine surveillance activities.  This is  endorsed. Cases of boosting 
dosing  do not  need to be  further  discussed through  PBRERs  unless  significant  new  safety 
information is identified.

2.3.23.  Health Authority  requests  - Menstrual  disorders 
Please note  that Menstrual  disorders  data is not  reproduced  here  (see Section  1 5. 2. 4  of the PBRER) 
MAH's summary 
Cumulative  review of case  reports:  Menstrual  disorders  are  very common  and  have  high  incidence 
rates  regardless  of vaccination;  and stress  (physical  or  psychological)  is  a common  aetiology.  There are 
20994 reports of menstrual  disorder  reported globally for VAXZEVRIA.  The  number of reports  is 
relatively low compared to  both the  number of  people vaccinated  and  the  prevalence  of menstrual 
disorders  generally  (Kwak et al 2019).  The TIO median  was 8  days  and most  of the  reports  (76% ) 
were reported within 28  days  post  vaccination.  Most of  events  were reported  in  the  age  groups  35-44 
(31. 5%),  25-34  (23. 1% )  and 45-54  (22. 1%). 
The most  reported  menstrual  disorders  were heavy menstrual blood  loss  (6547),  followed by 
amenorrhoea/oligomenorrhoea  (5518)  and other  menstrual  disorders  (5356).  Menstrual 
disorders  can  be  very diverse  and different  per individual.  Although the  reported  menstrual  events  were 
categorised  in 9 categories,  many  of the  reports contained multiple menstrual events and  fell into 
multiple categories. 
The  most  frequent co-reported AEs  were known systemic  and  local  reactions.  These  are  very  common 
reactions  and  were to be  expected.  Other reactions that were frequently co-reported  were reactions 
related to  the  menstrual cycle,  such as breast  changes  and  mood  swings. 
A  total  48%  of menstrual  disorder events  had not  resolved at the time  of reporting.  It is  possible 
that,  women reported their complaints  before  they  fully  recovered  which is understandable  since 
menstrual  disorders such as amenorrhoea and  irregular  menstrual cycle  generally  can  take  a longer time 
to recover. 
Due to insufficient information  available  in  these  reports,  these  findings  do not  provide more  insight  on 
the possible  relationship  between  VAXZEVRIA and  menstrual  disorders.  In  summary,  the  review of 
available  data  from  spontaneous  reports  regarding  menstrual disorders did not  identify an  index case 
or other  evidence of a  new  or emerging  signal. 
literature  summary:  As  pointed  out  in  Von Woon  et  al 2022,  Lagana  et al 2022,  Muhaidat et al  2022 
articles,  there  seems to be an  association  between  COVID-19  vaccination  (regardless of  type) 
and menstrual  disorders.  The  conclusion  by Wang et al 2022  that  is  no  link  between  menstrual 
disorders  and COVID-19  infection  but rather  vaccination  is  plausible  giving  that  both  mRNA  and 
adenovirus-vectored vaccines were  both  associated  with  menstrual change.  Many of the  literature 
available  recommended  future  work to  examine  the  potential  biological  mechanisms  that  may  explain  an 
association  between  COVID-19  vaccination  and menstrual  disorders.  The design  of most  studies  reviewed 
did not  consider control  groups,  hence  it  is  impossible to  make  causal  inferences from  them.  The actual 
incidence  rate  of  menstrual  disorders  with  COVID-19  vaccination  is  still unclear due  to problems  of 
overestimating,  underestimating  and  biases.  However,  there  seem to be  more  calls  for  studies  designed 
particularly to aid the determination  of causal inference  and also confirm  biologic mechanisms that  will 
adequately  explain  the  effects  of  COVID  vaccination  on  menstrual  disorders. 
MAH's Conclusion 
Based  on  the  review of the  updated cumulative data,  AstraZeneca considers  that there  is  insufficient 
evidence to  suggest  a causal association  between  menstrual  disorders and  VAXZEVRIA.  It  is 
AstraZeneca's  opinion  that  no changes  to the CDS  or RMP are  warranted  at  this  time.  AstraZeneca will 
closely  monitor  safety  information  for  Menstrual  disorders  as  part  of the  ongoing safety  surveillance 
activities  for VAXZEVRIA.

Page  69/123 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
As requested the  MAH presented an  in-depth evaluation of all available data and recently published 
literature,  including  a discussion  on  possible mechanism.  Additionally  the  MAH also  presented  a refined 
review of cases  of rechallenge. 
Cumulative  review  of the  cases (DLP 28  June 2022) 
Cumulatively,  a total  of  20994 cases  have  been  identified  and a total of 27145  adverse  events  of 
interest were  reported: 
•  Dose:  11748  (68.3%),  5415  (31.5%)  and 46  (0. 27%) cases  were reported after the  first dose, 
second dose  and third dose,  respectively.  Only 1 case  was  reported  after  both  doses.  This  medically 
confirmed rechallenge case  was  reported which had a limited  information  for further assessment 
• Age:  the median  age was  41  years;  2148  cases (~10%) were  reported  in  women  over 50  years  of 
age; 
•  Seriousness:  7960  (37.9%) cases  were considered serious  and 1323  (6.3%) cases were 
medically confirmed. Reported seriousness criteria were  mainly  medically important event  (85. 2%  of 
reported events),  followed  by  disability  (9. 2%) and  hospitalization  (4. 4%).  The  reported AE resulted  in 
death in 2  cases; 
•  Time to  Onset:  76%  of the  events  with known TTO  were reported within 28  days  post  vaccination; 
median TIO was 8  days.  Overall,  the TTO  was  distributed  as  followed: 0-2 days  (21.2%),  3-7  days 
(12.6%),  8-14  days  (10.1%),  15-28  days  (12.6%),  >  29  days  (17.4%) and  unknown  (26%). 
•  Co-reported PTs: The  most  frequently co-reported AEs were systemic AEs  (i. e.  reactogenicity),  as  well 
as  some  menstruation symptoms (e.g.  breast complaints,  mood swings and  hot  flushes;  the latter can  be 
related  to  menopause  as well). 
•  Medical history:  The most common reported medical history  were  Suppressed lactation,  Suspected 
COVID-19,  Pregnancy,  Disease  risk factor  (unspecified),  Asthma,  and  Immunodeficiency  (995  medical 
history reported).  A  total  of 197  vaccinees  were pregnant at  the  time  of reporting  of  menstrual disorder 
event;  and 80  vaccinees  had  co-reported  event  of abortion. 
•  Outcome:  10012  out  of 27145  events  (37%) had resolved/resolved with sequelae/resolving 
(and 46%  in  medically  confirmed reports);  12974  events  (48% )  not recovered at  time  of reporting;  2 
cases  reported a fatal  outcome. 
For cases  which recovered,  the median  duration  of  events  was  7  days. 
•  Reported PTs:  Heavy menstrual  bleeding  (6547  events,  24%)  was  the  most  reported PT followed 
by Amenorrhoea/  oligomenorrhoea  (5518  events,  20%).  16421 (78. 2% ) cases  reported  only one 
menstrual  disorder  event,  3587  ( 17 . 1  % ) cases  reported 2 menstrual  disorder  events  and 986  ( 4. 7%) 
cases  reported 3 to 5  menstrual disorder events. 
Majority  of the heavy menstrual  bleeding  events  were reported  in  the  age  group  of 35-44 
(34%) followed  by  45-54y  (27%)  and  25-34y  (19%).  For  most  women  the  duration  of  the  bleeding was 
either  unknown  or the  woman  was  not recovered yet  (46%).  However,  in  the  medically confirmed reports 
48%  heavy  menstrual  blood  loss events  had  resolved.  Out of 1046 events  with  a known  duration, 
760 (73%) had a bleeding  duration of less than 14  days.  According  to the MAH,  no trend  was 
observed in  terms  of concomitants  medication  or  medical  history. 
Majority  of the Amenorrhoea/ oligomenorrhoea  events  were reported  in  the  age group  of 35-
44  years  (30% )  followed by 25-34y (27% )  and 45-54y  (19% )  years.  The majority of the  events  (52% ) 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  70/123 
had not  recovered  at  the  time  of reporting,  31 %  resolved/were  resolving,  and 2%  resolved with  sequalae, 
at  the  time  of reporting. In 313  (46%)  events  of amenorrhoea/oligomenorrhoea out of 545 
events, the reported duration was longer than 14  days.  Of note,  230  women  had history of 
pregnancy,  37  were pregnant at  the  time  of  vaccination  or  after  vaccination,  64  women  had  history  of 
breast feeding,  37 and 33  women had  history  of endometriosis  and  polycystic  ovaries  respectively. 
All other events  including with PTs:  Menstrual  disorder  (3238),  Vaginal haemorrhage  (1880), 
Uterine haemorrhage (103),  Menometrorrhagia  (76),  and Anovulatory  cycle  (33).  Most  of the  events 
( 42%)  had  not  recovered  at  the  time  of reporting,  however 41 %  were  resolved/resolving/resolved with 
sequalae.  Out of  793 events  with  a known duration,  582  (73.4%) had  resolved  within 14 days 
of  onset. 
•  Reporting trend analysis over time: The peak  of reports received at  the  time when Menstrual 
Disorders  were  discussed  in media suggest a  media concern.  However,  the distribution of  date  of onset 
follows  the vaccination campaign. 
Literature 
The  MAH identified and discussed  seven  (7)  publications  on: 
•  A prospective  observational  study  (Von Woon  et al 2022)  included  79  menstruating  women  who 
logged  at  least  three  consecutive  cycles,  during  which  time  they  each received  at  least  one  dose  of 
COVID-19  vaccine  which  included  Pfizer  (65  [82. 3%]),  Moderna (11  [14% ])  and AstraZeneca  (3 
[3.8%1).  The results showed that a dose  of the COVID-19 vaccine was associated  with  a delay 
to  start of menstruation in the subsequent period  in spontaneously cycling  participants  (2.3 
days after dose  1;  1.3  days after dose  2).  No significant change  was  noted  in  self-reported menstrual 
flow in  the  period  or withdrawal bleed following vaccination,  either in  spontaneously cycling participants, 
or  in  those  taking hormonal  contraception.  No association  between menstrual changes and other 
commonly reported  side  effects  of  vaccination,  such as  sore  arm,  fever,  and  fatigue. 
•  A survey  (Lagana  et al 2022)  evaluated  menstrual  irregularities  after the  first and second doses  of the 
COVID-19  vaccine  in  Italy through a survey  distributed  by  social  media  [Vaxzevria  n = 9;  JnJ n = 3; 
Comirnaty  n= 133;  Spikevax  n: 19].  The results  showed  that  approximately 50%  to  60%  of 
reproductive-age  women  who received the  first dose  of  the COVID-19 vaccine reported 
menstrual cycle  irregularities,  regardless  of the type  of administered vaccine.  The  occurrence 
of menstrual  irregularities seems to be slightly higher  (60%  to  70%)  after the second dose. 
Menstrual  irregularities  after  both the  first  and  second doses  of the  vaccine  were found  to  self-resolve  in 
approximately half  the cases within 2  months. 
•  A retrospective  online survey  (Baena-Garcia et al  2022)  described the  prevalence  of  perceived 
premenstrual and  menstrual  changes  after  COVID-19  vaccine  administration  in  Spain  from June  to 
September 2021.  A  total  of 14153 women  (mean age 31. 5 ± 9. 3  years  old)  who  had  received the  full 
course  of vaccination  at  least  three months  earlier were  included  in  this  cross-sectional  study  [Vaxzevria 
n=2224 ;  JnJ n= 725;  Comirnaty  n= 8727;  Spikevax  n= 2476].  The most  predominant  menstrual 
changes  were more menstrual  bleeding  (43%),  more menstrual  pain  (41%),  delayed 
menstruation  (38%),  fewer days  of  menstrual  bleeding  (34.5%),  and shorter cycle length 
(32%). The study  concluded  that  women vaccinated against COVID-19 usually  perceive mild  menstrual 
and  premenstrual  changes and future  studies  are  warranted  to  clarify the  physiological  mechanisms 
behind these  widely reported changes. 
•  In a cross-sectional  investigation  online  self-administered  survey  (Muhaidat  et  al 2022)  the 
prevalence  and  impact of  menstrual  abnormalities  after  the  COVID-19  vaccination  (Comirnaty  n= 1099; 
Sinopharm  n= 801 and Vaxzevria  n=304) was  investigated  among  females  (2269,  mean age  of 34. 3  ± 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  71/123 
8. 5) residing within the  Middle East  and  North Africa during July and August 2021.  The  results showed 
66.3%  females  were having  menstrual  symptoms post-vaccination, thereof  46.7% after the 
first dose. Among  the  participants,  75.1%  had regular menstrual  cycles before taking  the 
vaccine  for the  last  year,  and  24.9%  had  irregular menstrual  cycles.  Vaccine type  did not 
significantly  influence  the  incidence  of abnormalities  (p  <  0. 05). 
•  A prospective,  active  observational,  PASS (Rogers et al 2022)  study  reported  on  the  incidence  of 
adverse  events  (AEs),  reactogenicity symptoms,  menstrual changes and overall self-rated  improvement 
in health and  well-being after  COVID-19 vaccination in 16265 participants registered through a website 
[Vaxzevria 2 doses n =5947, 1 dose  n=331;  Comirnaty 2  doses  n=  4240,  1  dose  n= 270].  Overall 
rates of  women aged 18-59 reporting  menstrual  symptoms  in  the  12 weeks  after  vaccination  were 
low  (0.3%).  Unadjusted percentages  of reporting menstrual  symptoms,  including menstrual cycle 
alteration  or  intermenstrual  bleeding (12 events),  heavy  bleeding (11)  or  painful  periods/cramping  (5) 
within 12 weeks  of vaccination  were  higher after COMIRNATY  vaccinations  (0.6%  after first  dose,  0.4% 
after second  dose)  than  after  ChAdOxl  (0.2%  after first  dose,  0. 2%  after second  dose).  However,  there 
was  no  difference between vaccines after  adjusting  for  age  in  a  proportional hazards model and  overall 
cumulative  rates  were low.  Participants  reported these  events  as 25%  mild,  54%  moderate  and 21 % 
severe;  none  resulted  in hospitalisation.  The study  provides  reassuring data  on  low rates  of AEs  after 
COVID-19  vaccination. 
•  A literature  review  (Nazir  et  al 2022)  using digital  databases  to  systematically  identify the  studies 
reporting any  menstrual  abnormalities  after the COVID-19  vaccine.  A  total  of 78,138 vaccinated  females 
were  included  in  this  review from  14  studies.  Of these,  39,759 (52.05%) had some form  of a 
menstrual  problem after vaccination.  Menorrhagia,  metrorrhagia,  and polymenorrhea were the 
most observed problems  and  the  overall  study-level rate  of  menstrual  abnormality  ranged from 0. 83% 
to 90. 9%.  The  review  concluded  that  further  prospective  cohort studies  are  needed  to  identify  the 
temporal  link  between  menstrual  cycle changes. 
•  A  prospective  study  (Wang  et al 2022)  reported the  associations  of SARS-CoV-2  infection and  COVID-
19  vaccination  with menstrual cycle  characteristics.  The  study  involved prospectively following 3858  pre­
menopausal women  in  the  Nurses' Health Study 3  (NHS3)  living in  the  United States  or Canada 
[Vaxzevria  n=7;  JnJ n= 84;  Comirnaty  n= 2145;  Spikevax  n= 1282].  Authors  concluded that COVID-
19 vaccination may be associated with short-term  changes in usual menstrual cycle length, 
particularly among  women  whose cycles  were short, long  or  irregular before vaccination. These 
results underscore  the  importance  of  monitoring  menstrual health in  vaccine  clinical trials.  Future work 
should  examine  the  potential  biological  mechanisms.

•  Using  a self-controlled case-series  study,  Trogstad et al.  (2022)
,  observed an  increased risk of 
heavy  bleeding  after  COVID-19  vaccination  (i. e.  RR  of 1. 90  (95%  CI:  1. 69-2. 13)  for  Dose 1;  RR  of 1. 84 
(1. 66-2. 03)  for  Dose 2).  The  analysis  was  performed in  a cohort  of 5688  women  aged 18-30  years 
(Comirnaty  n=3295;  Spikevax  n= 2020;  No vaccine  n=478).  Increased  risk after  vaccination  was  also 
observed  for  other menstrual  disturbances.  The  authors  concluded  that  they found a significant 
increase  in menstrual disturbances after vaccination,  particularly  for heavier bleeding than usual, 
longer  duration  and  for short  interval  between menstruations.  Mechanisms  underlying  these  findings  may 
involve bleeding  disturbances  in  general,  as  well as  endocrine  alterations. 
Conclusion 
Overall,  the  review of cases shows  a temporal relationship where  majority  of the  events  occurred within 
28  days  post  vaccination.  Median TTO  was  8 days.  Majority  of the  heavy  menstrual  bleeding (80%)  and 
Amenorrhoea/oligomenorrhoea  (76% )  events  were  reported  in  the age  group  of 25-54  yrs  similar  to 
overall  menstrual disorders  combined.  Among  cases  which  recovered,  the  median duration  of symptoms 
was  7  days and  majority  of the AEs resolved within 8 days.  Cases mainly  occurred after the  first dose and 
there  was  only 1  case  of rechallenge,  with limited information.  Considering the TTO,  a causal association 
cannot  be  ruled  out.  However,  there was  not a clear  pattern  of reported  disorders.  Heavy  menstrual 
bleeding,  amenorrhoea/oligomenorrhoea and  other menstrual disorders  were reported  more  or less  in  a 
similar  proportion  (i. e.  6547  AEs,  5518  AEs  and 5378 AEs  respectively). 
In the literature,  several surveys  and  studies  suggested that  COVID-19  vaccination was associated with 
menstrual  disorders.  Here  again,  the studies  relate  to a wide range  of menstrual  disorders.  Moreover,  the 
studies  present some  limitations  and biases,  and  mainly  include  mRNA  vaccines.  For  example,  the  study 
of Trogstad  (2022)  which  showed  a significant  increase  in heavy menstrual  bleeding  did not  include 
Vaxzevria vaccinated women. 
In conclusion,  available data  cannot  confirm  nor rule out  a possible association  between menstrual 
disorders  and  Vaxzevria.  More  particularly,  the  level  of  evidence  from the  literature  is  not sufficient  at  this 
stage  to  support  an  update  of the  Pl.  Safety  information  for  Menstrual  disorders  will  be  closely  monitored 
by the MAH as  part  of the  ongoing safety  surveillance activities  for  Vaxzevria,  which  is  supported.  Cases 
of menstrual  disorders do  not need to be  further discussed through  PBRERs  unless significant 
new  safety information is  identified.  More relevant information is  expected to be  provided from 
the  update review of the literature.  [Request for the  next PBRER] 
2.3.24.  Health Authority  requests  - Myocarditis 
Please note  that  myocarditis  data  is not  reproduced  here  (Section  1 5. 2 . 5  of the PBRER). 
MAH's summary 
Of 761  Myocarditis  cases,  no  gender  preponderance  was  noted  between  males  (50. 9% ) and  females 
(49. 1 % ).  The majority  of events  (48. 3% ) were for vaccinees between  the  ages 40  to 64 years.  The 
majority  (65. 0%) of cases  were  reported  after  Dose 1 as  compared  to  Dose 2  (22. 7% )  and  Dose  3 
(0. 8%).  Out of 763  events  from 761  reports,  99.9%  events  were  serious  with 2. 8%  resulting in death. 
There have  been 266  (214  initial reports  and 52 follow-up)  additional case  reports  of  Myocarditis 
compared to  previous  PBRER  (with  DCO  December 2021  that discussed 593 cases).  Of 761 case  reports, 
1. 6%  fulfilled  BCC 1  criteria,  6.8%  fulfilled  BCC 2  criteria,  no  case  fulfilled  BCC 3  criteria,  51. 2%  fulfilled

BCC 4,  and 40. 3%  fulfilled  BCC 5 criteria.  WHO-UMC causality  assessment for  Myocarditis  was  performed 
for 64  cases  (BCC levels 1,  2 and 3  cases),  and  none of the cases met WHO-UMC criteria for "Probable" 
(Likely)  or "Certain".  A  total  of 45. 3%  were considered  as possibly related,  21.9%  were considered  as 
unlikely related,  25. 0%  were  considered  as  Unassessable/Unclassifiable  and  7. 9%  were  considered  as 
Conditional/Unclassified.  In addition,  34. 4%  were  identified  with  relevant risk/confounding factors  and 
65.6%  cases  had  limited information  for a comprehensive  causal  assessment.  There  were  no  case  that 
reported a recurrence/worsening  of  myocarditis  with  a subsequent  dose  of  VAXZEVRIA.  There  were  no 
index  cases  identified  from  review of  case  reports.  Observed vs expected analysis  suggests  that  observed 
number of cases  regardless  of age,  gender,  dose  and  various  risk windows  did not  exceed  the  expected 
number of cases.  A  review of literature  suggests various hypothesized mechanisms  for  development  of 
Myocarditis mainly in association  with mRNA vaccines. 
MAH's  conclusion 
From the data  identified  during  the  reporting period and  also  taking  into account  the  cumulative 
experience,  it  is  AstraZeneca's  opinion  that currently there  is  insufficient evidence  of a causal  association 
between myocarditis  and  VAXZEVRIA.  AstraZeneca  did  not find evidence  of a new or emerging signal for 
Myocarditis  to suggest  a need to update  the  VAXZEVRIA  CDS  or RMP.  Myocarditis  is  an  AESI  for 
VAXZEVRIA  and  will continue  to be kept under close  surveillance  by  AstraZeneca. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
Cumulatively,  761 cases  of myocarditis have  been reported,  of which 266 cases (214 initial,  52 follow­
up) were received  during  the  current  reporting interval.  Out  of the  761  cases,  65%  occurred  after  dose 1, 
22. 7%  after  dose 2 and  0. 8%  after  dose  3  (11.4%  unknown).  There  were  no cases  with a  positive 
rechallenge  (i. e.  recurrence/worsening  of myocarditis after  dose  2  or 3).  All cases  were  serious and 29% 
of the  cases  were  medically confirmed. 
Approximately half of the  cases  (52% )  were reported from the  UK.  The  ratio  female  (49%) to male 
(51%)  was  almost equal.  The  median age  was 48 years (range:  10-95  years).  Most cases  with known age 
were reported  in vaccinees aged 18  to 40  years  (33%)  and 41  to 64  years (48% ).  In 50%  of the  cases, 
time to  onset  (TTO) was  unknown;  from cases  with  available  data,  67%  had  a TTO  within  the  risk 
window  of 2  to 42  days  (median TTO:  12 days;  TTO  range:  0  to 344 days).  The  PT 'myopericarditis' was 
reported in 59  cases. 
The  MAH classified the  cases  using  the Brighton Collaboration  Classification  (BCC)  case  definition 
for myocarditis.  Out  of the  761  case  reports,  12 (1.6%) fulfilled level 1  criteria,  52  (6. 8%) fulfilled  level 
2  criteria,  none  fulfilled level 3  criteria,  390  (51. 2% )  fulfilled level 4  criteria and 307  (40. 3% )  fulfilled 
level 5  criteria.  As  requested,  the  MAH performed causality assessment according  to WHO-UMC 
criteria  for the 64  myocarditis cases  fulfilling  BCC  Level 1,  2  or 3.  Twenty-nine  (29)  cases  were classified 
as 'Possible' (of which 8  with risk factors/confounders and 21  with limited information),  14 cases as 
'Unlikely',  5 cases  as 'Conditional/Unclassified',  and 16  cases  as 'Unassessable'  ( of which 7  with risk 
factors/confounders and 9  with limited information).  Out  of the  29  cases  with  a  possible causal 
association,  3  cases  fulfilled  BCC  level 1  criteria and 26  cases  fulfilled  BCC level 2  criteria for diagnostic 
certainty  of myocarditis. 
Twenty-one  (21)  of the  761  cases  (2. 8%) had a fatal outcome.  Four fatal  cases occurred within  the  risk 
window of 2-42  days,  of which 2  fulfilled  BCC  Level 4  criteria and 2  BCC  Level 5  criteria.  Outcomes  in  the 
remaining case  reports  were:  Not Recovered  (39% ),  Recovering (19%),  Recovered  (13%),  Recovered 
With Sequelae  (5%),  and Unknown/missing (22%). 
The  MAH conducted  an  O/E analysis  for  all reported cases of  myocarditis with stratifications by risk 
window (7,  14,  21,  42  days),  age group, gender and dose.  Observed cases occurred less frequently  than 
PRAC PSUR assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  74/123 
expected for  all  stratifications,  except for UK males aged 18-29  years  with risk window 7  and 14  days, 
where  observed cases  were  more  than  expected  without  being statistically  significant.  The  MAH's  O/E 
analysis does  not  confirm  the  results  of the  SCCS study of  Patane  et al.  (2021),  who  observed  an 
increase  in  the  risk of myocarditis  within  a week of receiving the  first dose  of  Vaxzevria  (discussed  in  the 
AR of  PBRER02). 
A literature review  on  myocarditis  in  association with Vaxzevria and  other COVID-19 vaccines did not 
identify new relevant safety  information.  During the  period under review,  no  new  publications  on  relevant 
epidemiological studies or  a conclusive mechanism  of action were  identified. 
In conclusion,  no new  safety  information concerning  myocarditis  could be identified. The  PRAC 
rapporteur agrees  with the MAH's conclusion that  at  this  stage  no causal relationship  between myocarditis 
and Vaxzevria could  be  established.  The  MAH will continue  to closely monitor this  AESI,  which  is 
endorsed.  Cases of myocarditis  do not need to be further discussed through  PBRERs unless 
significant new  safety information  is  identified. 
2.3.25.  Health Authority requests - Sarcoidosis 
Please note  that  data  on  Sarcoidosis is not  reproduced  here  (Section  1 5. 2. 6  of the PBRER). 
MAH's summary 
Cumulatively  through OLP 28 June 2022,  a total  of 68 case  reports  of sarcoidosis  with the  use  of 
VAXZEVRIA have  been  received using a  broad search strategy,  of which 85. 3%  of the  reported  events 
were  serious and 14. 6%  were  non-serious.  The  age range  was  21years  to 67  years and  median  age  was 
reported as  and 49. 4  years. 30.8%  of cases  were  medically confirmed  and 69. 1 %  were  not  medically 
confirmed. 
The  most  common PTs reported were Cutaneous  Sarcoidosis 2  (2. 7%),  Loefgren syndrome 3  (4. 0%), 
Neurosarcoidosis 5  (6. 7%),  Pulmonary  sarcoidosis 5  (6. 7%),  Cardiac  sarcoidosis 2  (2. 7%),  Sarcoidosis 57 
(76. 0%) and Ocular sarcoidosis  1  (1.3%). 
Amongst  75  events  reported for sarcoidosis  received cumulatively through 28 June 2022,  35 ( 46. 7% )  had 
a reported  outcome  not  recovered,  16  (21.3%) for recovering/resolved,  8  (10. 7% )  recovered  with 
sequeale  and 16  (21.3%) had outcome unknown. 
OE analysis  showed  that  observed  cases  were  significantly  less  than  expected  cases. 
WHO UMC case  causality  analysis conducted  for  all case  reports,  the  majority of the case  reports (24 
[35. 3%]) were considered possible  with limited information,  possible  with confounder  (20  [29. 4%]) and 
unassesable/unclassifiable with  limited  information  (19  [27. 9%]) related  to  VAXZEVRIA. 
Overall,  the  clinical  pattern  of case  presentation  and  numbers  of reports  are  broadly  consistent  with what 
might  be  expected from  the natural  epidemiology  of  sarcoidosis,  and  no specific biological  mechanism 
through which  VAXZEVRIA vaccine  could  cause  or contribute  to the  development  of sarcoidosis has  been 
identified. 
MAH's conclusion 
Based  on  the  review of the  updated cumulative data,  AstraZeneca considers  that  there  is  insufficient 
evidence  to suggest a causal  association  between sarcoidosis  and  VAXZEVRIA.  It is AstraZeneca's opinion 
that  no  changes  to the CDS or RMP are  warranted at this  time.  The  topic  will continue  to be closely 
monitored  as part of AstraZeneca' s  ongoing  surveillance  activities.  AstraZeneca will no longer  discuss  the 
topic future  PBRERs,  unless  significant  new safety  information  arises.

Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
Cumulatively,  68  case  reports of Sarcoidosis  with 75  events  were identified.  Age  ranged from 21 to 67 
years (median: 49  years),  29  (42. 6%) concerned male patients and 38  (55. 9%) concerned female 
patients,  21  (31. 8%) case reports were medically confirmed and 47  (68. 2%) were non-medically 
confirmed. 
64  (85.3%) of  the  events  were serious  (17  medically confirmed and 47  non-medically confirmed) 
and reported seriousness  criteria were medically  important event (45  [60. 0%]),  disability  (15  [20.04%]), 
hospitalization (22 [29. 3%]),  life threatening  (3  [4. 0%]). 
9 (27.9%) were identified with relevant  risk /  confounding  factors,  History  of Sarcoidosis  (11), 
Immunodeficiency (4),  Hypertension  (2)  and  Neoplasm/Cancer (2). 
O/E analysis  showed an  observed significantly <  expected  (O/E  ratio  (95%  CI) 0  (0  - 0.01)) 
Literature did not  contain  relevant  new safety  information  regarding Sarcoidosis  and  its association  with 
Vaxzevria.  There  is  no  hypothesised  mechanism  for the  development  of sarcoidosis  in association  with 
Vaxzevria. 
WHO UMC case  causality  analysis was conducted  for all case  reports,  the  majority  of the  case  reports  (24 
[35. 3%]) were  considered possible  with  limited  information,  possible  with  confounder  (20 
[29.4%]) and  unassesable/unclassifiable  with  limited  information  (19  [27.9% 1 ). 
In the previous  PSUSA  the  MAH was asked to  redo the  causality  assessment  and  provide a  proper 
causality  assessment,  subsequently 44 cases  were classified as possible.  Issue resolved. 
The  MAH considers  that  there  is  insufficient  evidence  to suggest  a causal association between sarcoidosis 
and VAXZEVRIA  and  that  no changes  to  the  CDS  or RMP are warranted at  this  time.  The  topic  will 
continue  to be  closely monitored  as  part  of AstraZeneca's ongoing  surveillance activities.  AstraZeneca will 
no longer  discuss  the  topic future  PBRERs,  unless significant new safety  information  arises. 
This  is  endorsed. Cases of  Sarcoidosis  do  not  need  to be further discussed through  PBRERs 
unless  significant  new  safety  information  is identified. 
2.3.26.  Health Authority requests - Subacute thyroiditis 
Please note  that  data  on  Subacute  thyroiditis is not  reproduced  here  (Section  1 5. 2. 7 of the PBRER). 
MAH's Summary 
Cases  were  assessed  by  age,  sex,  type  of  event,  and outcome.  Of the  178 case  reports  of subacute 
thyroiditis  with the  use  of  VAXZEVRIA  have  been  received,  of which  64.6%  of the  reported  events  were 
serious  and 35. 4%  were  non-serious.  The age range was 19  to  83  years  and mean  and median age  was 
reported as  51  years  and 50  years,  respectively.  The case  reports  were  reported more  in  females  138 
(77. 5%) compared  to males 35  (19. 7%).  29.2%  of cases  were  medically  confirmed  and 70.8%  were  not 
medically  confirmed.  Subacute  thyroiditis  is  generally  reported  in  the  3rd to  5th decade,  and  is 1.9 to 6 
times  more  frequent  in  females  (Fatourechi  et al 2003).  For the  event of subacute  thyroiditis,  the  most 
common PTs reported were Autoimmune  thyroiditis  (49),  Thyroiditis  (60),  Thyroiditis  acute  (22),  and 
Thyroiditis  subacute  (56). 
Amongst 178 case  reports  for  subacute  thyroiditis  received cumulatively through OLP 28 June 2022,  64 
events  had a reported  outcome  of recovered  or recovering,  the  outcome  of recovered with sequelae  was 
reported in  7  case  reports,  and  the case  outcome  of  Not recovered was  reported  in 88  of the  case  reports. 
No  fatal  event pertaining to searched  term  of 'Subacute  thyroiditis' was  reported.  The TTO was  varied  and 
PRAC  PSUR assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  76/123 
ranged from  O to 1  day  to more  than 42  days  and  there  was  no trend  or  pattern  seen.  Of the 178 
Subacute thyroiditis cases  reported globally and included in AstraZeneca's post-marketing database, 
there  were 118  case  reports  in  which the TTO  was within  the risk window of 42 days.  Underlying 
cause/confounding factors  were  noted  in 9.6%  of these  cases. 
The characteristics  of the  events  and  of the  individuals  with  events  were  as  expected  for the  general 
population,  including  the  observation  of increased  incidence  in  the  elderly.  No usual  trends  or  clusters 
were  identified.  None  of the  cases  met WHO-UMC  criteria for  Certain  or  Probable/Likely.  Of the  178 cases, 
there  were  no  fatal cases. 
The  O/E analysis  results  for  subacute  thyroiditis  showed  observed  cases  to  be  significantly  less  than 
expected. 
The  majority  of non-medically confirmed case  reports had limited information.  Of the  total  number of 
case  reports,  52  (29. 2%) were medically confirmed.  WHO-UMC case  causality assessment for  majority 32 
(61. 5%) medically confirmed case  reports  was "Possible" with limited information;  these  cases  lacked 
information  about medical history,  concomitant  medications,  or laboratory  values  and  no trend  was  seen. 
However,  4  (7. 7% )  case  reports demonstrated possible  risk factors/confounders  and  were  assessed as 
possible  with confounders.  In 6  (11. 5% )  cases  the  time to onset was  outside  the  risk window of 42 days 
and therefore  assessed  as  unlikely related  to  VAXZEVRIA.  In 10  (19. 2%) cases  the  time to onset was 
unknown and  were  assessed as "Unassessable". 
Overall,  none  of the case  reports  raised  any new relevant safety  concerns  for  subacute  thyroiditis 
cumulatively until OLP 28 June 2022  during  the  reporting  period.  Also,  in  summary,  the  review of 
available  data  from  spontaneous  reports  regarding  of Subacute  thyroiditis did not  identify an  index case 
or  other  evidence  of a new or  emerging  signal. 
MAH's  Conclusion 
Based  on  the  review of the  available cumulative data,  AstraZeneca considers  that  currently  there  is 
insufficient evidence  of a causal association between subacute thyroiditis and  VAXZEVRIA.  It  is 
AstraZeneca's  opinion  that  no changes  to the VAXZEVRIA  CDS  or RMP are warranted  at  this  time. 
Subacute thyroiditis is an  AESI  for  VAXZEVRIA  and  will  continue  to be  closely  monitored  as  part  of 
AstraZeneca's  ongoing  surveillance  activities.  AstraZeneca will no longer  discuss  the  topic future  PBRERs, 
unless  significant new  safety  information  arises. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
Cumulatively,  178 case reports  of subacute thyroiditis  with the use  of VAXZEVRIA have  been  received, 
of which  64.6%  of the  reported  events  were serious  and  35.4%  were  non-serious.  The  age  range  was  19 
to 83  years  and  mean  and  median  age  was  reported as 51  years and 50  years,  respectively.  The  case 
reports  were  reported more  in  females  138  (77.5%) compared  to males 35  (19.7%).  29. 2%  of 
cases  were  medically  confirmed  and  70.8%  were  not medically confirmed.  For the  event  of subacute 
thyroiditis,  the  most  common  PTs reported were  Autoimmune  thyroiditis  ( 49),  Thyroiditis  (60),  Thyroiditis 
acute  (22),  and Thyroiditis  subacute  (56). 
64  events  had a reported  outcome  of recovered  or recovering,  the  outcome  of recovered with sequelae 
was  reported  in  7  case  reports,  and the case  outcome of not recovered was  reported  in 88  of the case 
reports.  No fatal event was  reported.  The TTO was  varied  and  ranged  from  O to 1  day  to more  than 42 
days and  there  was  no  trend  or pattern seen.  There were 118 case  reports  in which the TTO was  within 
the risk window of 42 days.  Underlying cause/confounding factors were  noted in  9.6%  of these cases. 
The  O/E analysis  results  for subacute thyroiditis showed observed cases to be significantly less  than 
expected.

Review of literature  did  not identify  any  new safety  information  on  this  topic. 
According  to the  MAH,  none  of the  case  reports  raised any new relevant  safety concerns  for  subacute 
thyroiditis  and  the  review of available  data  from  spontaneous  reports  regarding  of Subacute  thyroiditis  did 
not identify  an  index case  or  other evidence  of a new or  emerging signal. 
The  MAH considers  that  currently  there  is  insufficient  evidence  of a causal  association between  subacute 
thyroiditis  and  VAXZEVRIA  and  that  no changes  to  the  VAXZEVRIA  CDS or RMP are  warranted  at  this 
time.  Subacute  thyroiditis  is  an  AESI  for  VAXZEVRIA  and will  continue  to  be  closely  monitored  as  part  of 
AstraZeneca's  ongoing  surveillance  activities This  is  endorsed. 
Cases of Subacute thyroiditis  do  not need to be further discussed through  PBRERs unless 
significant new  safety information  is  identified. 
2.3.27.  Health Authority requests - Glomerulonephritis  A N D  Ne phrotic 
syndrome  (including  IgA  Ne phropathy) 
Rapporteur assessment comment: 
In May 2022,  EMA identified a signal on 'glomerulonephritis  and  nephrotic  syndrome' after COVID-19 
vaccination after performing signal detection  in  EudraVigilance  (EV) and after reviewing scientific 
literature.  This signal was  sent in  parallel for Comirnaty,  JCOVDEN  and SPIVKEVAX. 
At that  time,  a search in  EV  for  HLT 'Glomerulonephritis  and  nephrotic  syndrome'  yielded  85  cases 
associated  with  Vaxzevria,  including 4  case  from  the  literature  (15 March 2022).  No disproportionate 
reporting was  found.  Eleven  (11) cases  were  identified from 9  articles  in  the literature  and 4 cases  of 
ANCA-associated vasculitis.  Most  patients  improved  with treatment and  three patients  required dialysis. 
WHO-UMC identified a safety signal  of  IgA nephropathy  following  administration  of  COVID-19  vaccines 
after screening  VigiBase.  A  majority  of the  cases  (88% )  followed administration  of  mRNA based  vaccines 
and 13%  of the  cases were  associated  with Vaxzevria. 
At that  time,  PRAC concluded that a separate signal  procedure  was  not  warranted but asked the MAH 
questions  to further discuss the  topic.  MAH's responses  are discussed here-after. 
Request to the  MAH 
The MAH is requested  to  submit: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
a  cumulative  review  of cases based on  search conducted  at the level of HL T  "glomerulonephritis  and 
nephrotic  syndrome"; 
causality  assessments  of the cases; 
a  review  of articles published during  the PSUR  reporting  period; 
a  discussion on  the  need  for  updating  product  information  and/or  risk management plan,  and submit 
proposal  as required. 
Additional  note to  the MAH:  Published  cases  should be submitted  to Eudravigilance and attempts should 
be made  to  follow up on  poorly documented  spontaneous  cases. 
Background  information 
The  major pathological types  of  glomerulonephritis  (GN)  are  IgA  nephropathy  (lgAN),  membranous 
nephropathy  (MN),  membrano-proliferative  glomerulonephritis  (MPGN),  mesangial  proliferative 
glomerulonephritis,  minimal change  disease  (MCD),  focal  segmental  glomerulosclerosis (FSGS),  post-
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  78/123 
infectious  glomerulonephritis,  idiopathic  crescentic proliferative  glomerulonephritis,  ANCA-associated 
necrotising crescentic  glomerulonephritis,  anti-glomerular  basement membrane  disease  (Error! 
Reference source not found.,  Error!  Reference source not found.). 
The underlying pathogenetic mechanism is  immune-mediated  (humoral  as  well as  cell-mediated 
pathways may be active)  followed  by  consequent  inflammatory response.  Kidney  biopsy  is mandatory for 
diagnosis  (Error!  Reference source  not  found.). 
The age standardized rates  in 2019 for  incidence  of acute glomerulonephritis  per 100,000  population 
were 9.45 (95%  uncertainty  interval,  7. 72 to 11.55) and the  mortality rate  was  0. 13 (95%  uncertainty 
interval,  0. 10 to 0.16) (Guo  et al 2021).  IgA  Nephropathy  (or  Berger's disease)  is  the  most common  of all 
glomerulonephritis  with an  incidence  estimated  to be 2. 5  per 100,000  patient  years  (Sethi  et al 2016; 
McGrogan 2011). 
Nephrotic syndrome  (NS) represents the  clinical  manifestations  of several  kidney diseases, 
characterized clinically by  the presence  of  peripheral  edema,  heavy proteinuria,  hypoalbuminemia,  and 
hypercholesterolemia.  Most  adult patients  with  NS have  primary glomerular  diseases,  including  FSGS, 
MN,  and  MCD)  (Kadner 2016;  Hull  and Goldsmith,  2008;  0th  and  Ritz 1998).  Although the  population 
incidence  of  NS is  estimated  to  be  approximately 3  per  100,000  person-years  (Gao  et al  2021). 
Review  of  the cases 
The cumulative  search retrieved a total  of 115 case  reports containing 130  events  of Glomerulonephritis 
AND  Nephrotic syndrome  (including  IgA  Nephropathy).  Fourteen  ( 14)  cases were  identified  in  the 
literature  and  have  been  submitted  to  EudraVigilance.  Hundred  (100)  of the  115  cases  were serious. 
The  most  frequent PTs (n>5) were  Nephrotic  syndrome (43),  GN minimal lesion  (16),  IgAN  (13), 
granulomatosis  with polyangiitis (11),  GN (9),  and focal segmental  glomerulosclerosis. 
From the  115  cases,  95  (83% )  were  reported after first  dose,  16  (14% )  after second dose,  and 4  (3%) 
after both first and second dose.  Three  cases  experienced the events  after the first  dose and had a 
recurrence or worsening  of the  event with the  second dose  (positive rechallenge).  Two  of these  cases 
were  assessed  as  per  WHO-UMC  causality  as  possible and one as  unlikely.  An  additional case  reported 
information  of ongoing resolution  of the  event  of granulomatosis  with  polyangiitis despite  administration 
nd 
of 2
vaccine dose.  No specific trend in  case  of recurrence  was  identified. 
Out  of 66 medically confirmed cases  pertaining to Glomerulonephritis  AND Nephrotic  syndrome 
(including  IgA  Nephropathy),  7  case  reports  reported a relapse or flare-up  of  pre-existing  condition. 
The following  observations  were  made  from a review of the 115 case  reports: 
• 
Vaccinee  age  was  reported  in 110  (95. 6%) case  reports  and  ranged 19  to 95  years  (median:  58 
years). 
•  There was  no specific  gender predilection;  58  (50. 4%) males  and 57  (49. 6% )  females. 
•  A  total 66  (57. 4%) case  reports were  medically confirmed  and 49  (42. 6% ) were consumer reports. 
•  Of the total 115 case  reports,  the  time to onset  (TTO)  from  VAXZEVRIA  administration  to 
Glomerulonephritis AND Nephrotic  syndrome (including IgA Nephropathy) was  reported  in  76 case 
reports and ranged O  days  to 333  days  (median:  14  days).  Seventy-nine  percent  (79% )  of the cases 
were reported within 42  days after vaccination. 
•  One hundred  and  twelve  (116 ;  86. 2%) of the  events were serious,  including one death  and 14 
(9. 3% )  hospitalisations.  The remaining 18 were  non-serious.  The fatal  outcome was a  event  of 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  79/123 
glomerulonephritis  proliferative  in  78 year-old  patient  with other  pulmonary  conditions  including 
pneumonia,  emphysema and  interstitial lung disease. 
• 
39  cases  (34%) had  information  on medical history  and  concomitant  medications.  The  confounders 
were  pre-existing  renal conditions  ( 13),  infections  ( 11 % ),  pre-existing  dyslipidemia,  diabetes  mellitus 
(9% ),  neoplasms  (6% )  and  auto-immune  disorders  (7%). 
•  WHO-UMC  causality assessment  was  performed for  the 115 case  reports and is as follows: 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
"Possible"  with limited information  for 48  ( 42%) case reports, 
"Possible"  with confounders  for 18  ( 16% )  case  reports, 
"Unlikely"  for 22  (19% )  case  reports, 
"Unassessable/Unclassified" with limited information  for 15  (13%) case  reports, 
"Unassessable/Unclassified" with confounders  for 12 (10%) case  reports. 
Fourty-six (46) PTs of  Nephrotic syndrome  in 43  cases  were  identified. 
• 
36  cases  were  serious  with no fatal  event; 
•  The  mean TT0 was 39  days  and  the  median TTO  was 18  days; 
• 
• 
Out  of 23  medically confirmed cases,  18  (78% )  were assessed  on WHO-UMC causality  scale as 
'Possible' based  on  temporal  association. 
Four case  report reported a relapse  or flare-up  of  pre-existing nephrotic  syndrome.  Three  cases 
presented  after first dose  and  the  fourth case  after the  second  dose. 
•  Out  of 23  medically  confirmed cases,  8  (35%) were  identified with relevant risk/confounding 
factors. 
Overall,  none  of the case  reports  raised  any new relevant safety  concerns  for the  event  of  VAXZEVRIA 
and nephrotic  syndrome. 
Thirteen  (13)  events  of IgA  nephropathy  (IgAN) were  identified: 
• 
9  (69% )  cases  were  serious with no fatal  outcome; 
•  Co-reported events  were haematuria or concurrent  IgA  vasculitis  (Henoch-Schonlein  purpura  in 3 
cases); 
• 
• 
3  cases  were confirmed with renal  biopsy.  None  of the  cases  had  information  on  immunotyping 
IgA deposits  (such as  IgAl)  or  other  immunological  determinant; 
In 7  cases  with medical history,  4  cases had  reported a  past  history of  IgAN.  In two  of these 
cases,  TTO  was  same day  and 1  day  respectively; 
•  TTO  was  reported  in 10 cases.  In 6/13  cases,  TTO  to  the presenting  symptom  of  IgAN ranged 
between 0-3  days.  This short TTO may be possibly  explained by innate  non-specific  immunity or 
pre-existing  disease  pathogenesis  rather  than  adaptative  immunity to the  vaccine; 
• 
In 7  out  of 13 cases,  the  assessment as per WHO-UMC scale was  considered  as  Possible; 
In summary,  on  cumulative  review of 13 cases  pertaining to  IgA nephropathy,  based  on  insufficient case 
details  ( on medical history,  concomitant medications,  etiological work-up)  for  a comprehensive causal 
assessment  or  based on  confounders,  there  is unsubstantiated evidence  to support a causal  relationship 
of  IgA nephropathy to  VAXZEVRIA.

Literature 
The  search identified a total  of 90  relevant abstracts.  From these,  56  concerned mRNA vaccines,  13 
multiple COVID-19  vaccines  [including  Vaxzevria  (n= S)J,  10  concerned  vector  based  vaccines  and 5 
concerned  inactivated vaccines. 
Three relevant  articles  with an  observational controlled  study  design  and consensus  review were 
identified and are summarised  by  the  PRAC assessor here-after: 
•  Diebold et al.,  2022.  Incidence  of  new onset  glomerulonephritis  after SARS-CoV-2 mRNA 
4
vaccination  is  not increased
. 
This  nationwide  (Swiss)  retrospective cohort  and  case-control  study  is specific to mRNA vaccine.  The 
authors  used  a database  of 229  kidney  biopsies  in  patients  aged  > 18  years  with  IgAN,  PINGN,  MCD, 
and MN.  The authors did not  demonstrate  an  association  between mRNA vaccines and new-onset GN. 
The  authors concluded that most temporal association between vaccination  and GN are likely 
coincidental. 
•  Stevens et al, 2022.  Perspective on COVID-19  vaccination  in  patients  with  immune­
mediated kidney diseases:  consensus statement form the  ERA-IWG  and EUVAS
5 
This  is  a review article  and  summary  of consensus  from  Immunonephrology Working Group  (IWG)  of 
the  European  Renal Association  (ERA)  and  the  European  Vasculitis  Society  (EUVAS).  This  consensus 
statement  provides  an  updated  overview of  vaccine  efficacy  in  patients  with  immune-mediated  kidney 
diseases  (IMKD) in respect to their treatment.  This  review considers all  vaccine  platforms. 
In the section  on  the  safety  of  COVID-19  vaccines  in  immune-mediated  kidney  diseases,  the authors 
discussed  the  risk of de nova  and  relapsing/flaring  GN. 
Most  IMKD  relapsed/flared were  diagnosed after the second dose  of the  COVID-19  vaccine,  with the 
exception  of  MCD,  which was usually found  after the  first  dose.  The authors also  report three  cases  of 
positive rechallenge. 
The  authors  conclude  that  patients  with immune-mediated  kidney diseases  should be prioritized to 
receive  booster doses  as early  as  possible,  as reduced vaccine response is anticipated in  many cases. 
Most disease  onset  or relapse/flare of immune-mediated kidney  disease  can  be  successfully  treated  in 
a standard  manner.  Reported  side effects  (including recurrence of  disease  or de novo 
glomerulonephritis)  are  rare  and  large population-based investigations are  necessary  to provide 
evidence  of a true association.  The  benefits  of  COVID-19  vaccines clearly  outweigh the  potential risks.

•  Zan et al, 2022.  Safety evaluation of COVID-19 vaccine  in  patients  with  IgA nephropathy or

IgA nephritis.  Kidney  international report
. 
The authors retrospectively  investigated 367  patients with IgAN.  Forty-six percent  ( 46% )  of the 
patients  received  at  least  1-dose  vaccination  and most  patients  were  injected  with an  inactivated 
vaccine  (Coronavac or  BBIBP-CorV).  There  were 2  flare-up  events.  There  was  no  significant difference 
between the  baseline  and postvaccination proteinuria  and hematuria.  Estimated glomerular filtration 
had a  mild but statistically significant difference  (68. 39  [23. 18] vs.  67. 33  [23. 53]  ml/min  per 1. 73 
m2;  P  - 0. 03) from pre-vaccination  to post-vaccination.  Glomerular filtration rate decline was 
temporary.  The  authors  concluded  that  ,  although the  vaccine  was  well tolerated,  close  monitoring  of 
kidney function  after vaccination  should be  offered to intervene  as early  as possible. 
Potential mechanism  of action 
Glomerulonephritis and nephrotic  syndrome: 
•  Abnormal T cell  mediated  glomerular  damage  (Leclerc et al 2021,  Biradar  et  al 2022,  Neves  et  al 
2022,  Schaubschlager et al 2022,  Timmermans  et al 2022) 
• 
B  cell pathway mediated podocytopathy  (Timmermans  et al 2022) 
•  Molecular  mimicry  between  SARS  CoV-2  spike protein and self -antigens  on  the  podocytes  (Leclerc  et 
al 2021)  - the self-antigens were unspecified 
•  Aberrant  activation  of the  immune  system  in  predisposed individuals  (Leclerc  et  al  2021) 
Specific  mechanisms  for  IgA  Nephropathy: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
anti-glycan  antibodies  that  cross-react  with  pre-existing under-galactosylated  IgAl (Abramson  et  al 
2021;  Kudose  et al,  2021;  Park  et al 2021;  Roberts 2021)  and  increase  of pathogenic  IgA  production 
post  vaccination  similar to the  influenza  vaccine  (Abramson  et al 2021;  Carr  et  al 2021;  Farooq  et  al 
2021;  Li  NL et al 2021;  Nihei 2022;  Negrea and  Rovin 2021;  Wu et al 2021) 
robust T-helper and  B  cell response  in  the germinal centre  by  mRNA vaccination (Abramson et al 
2021;  Chan  et al 2022) 
subclinical  IgAN  becoming  apparent  (Abramson  et  al 2021;  Acharya et al 2021;  Chan  et al 2022) ; 
Fujita et al,  2022;  Hanna  et  al,  2021;  Klomjit  et  al 2021;  Lo and  Chan  2021) 
potent stimulation  of immune  response  from  mRNA-based  vaccine  compared to  other vaccines 
(Abramson  et  al 2021;  Acharya  et  al 2021), 
stimulation  of Gut-associated  lymphoid tissue  and  other  mucosal  tissues  (Chan  et al 2022;  Hamza 
and Beers,  2021)  or  aberrant  mucosal  immunity response  (Roberts  2021) 
•  molecular  mimicry  (Fujita  et al,  2022;  Kanamori 2022) 
• 
delayed type hypersensitivity  (Rahim  et al 2021;  Plasse  et al  2021) 
• 
systemic cytokine-mediated  flare  (Kudose et al,  2021;  Park et al 2021) 
•  mRNA  based production  of aberrant glycosylated  IgA  via Toll-like  receptors  (TLRs)  signalling 
(Matsuzaki et al,  2021). 
MAH's Comments The review of mechanisms proposed  by  the authors included  both vaccine  type  specific 
and vaccine  non-specific  mechanisms.  For  IgAN,  the  mechanism  of presence  of subclinical  IgA  pathology 
was explored further,  however,  an  inconsistent association  of  IgAN flare/reactivation  with  patient 
receiving  multiple vaccine  types  was  observed.  The  remaining  mechanisms are hypothesis  and  further 
evidence  on  the  pathway  or mediators  leading to the glomerular injury are lacking.  Thus,  there  is 
insufficient comprehensive  evidence  for a conclusive mechanism  for glomerulopathies  following 
VAXZEVRIA vaccination and  that  evidence  from  other vaccine  types cannot be comprehensively 
extrapolated  to all  other vaccines.

MAH's Conclusion 
Based  on  the  review of the  currently  available data,  AstraZeneca considers  that  there  is  insufficient 
evidence  to suggest a causal  association  between  VAXZEVRIA  and Glomerulonephritis  AND  Nephrotic 
syndrome  (including  IgA  Nephropathy).  It is  AstraZeneca's  opinion that  no updates to  CDS  or RMP are 
warranted at  this  time. 
AstraZeneca will continue  to  monitor  safety information for Glomerulonephritis AND  Nephrotic syndrome 
(including  IgA Nephropathy) as part  of routine  safety surveillance activities  and  take further actions as 
deemed necessary. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
Cumulative review of  the cases: 
The  MAH reviewed 115  case  reports  of various  types  of glomerulonephritis  (GN) and nephrotic 
syndrome  (NS).  Some characteristics of the  events may  be  highlighted: 
- There were three  cases  of  positive  rechallenge; 
- About 10%  of reports were  possible cases  of flare/relapse:  7/66  cases  of GN,  4/46  cases of  NS,  and 4 
cases  with  past  history  of  IgAN out  of 13  IgAN; 
- 80%  of the  cases  occurred  within 42 days after vaccination 
Causality  assessment  of the cases 
From the  115  case  reports,  56%  were assessed 'Possible'  according  to  WHO-UMC  causality  criteria. 
Literature 
The three publications  that  were  discussed  were  not  specific to  Vaxzevria.  Overall,  these  publications 
do not support  an association  between  COVID-19  vaccine  and  new-onset  of glomerulonephritis  (Diebold). 
Some cases  of relapse/flare up  of immune-mediated kidney  disease  (IMKD)  were  reported (Stevens, 
Zan).  Difference  in  the glomerular filtration before and  after  vaccinations  were  also noted but  these  are 
transient  (Zan). 
All  publications stressed the  importance  to vaccinated immune-mediated kidney diseases  (IMKD)  patients 
against  COVID-19  and  concluded  that  the  benefit  of the  vaccine  overweight the  risks  in  this  population. 
Hypotheses  on  several  mechanisms  leading to alteration  kidney,  mainly  to podocytes,  were discussed  in 
the literature.  The  mechanism  is  still  open for discussion. 
Need  for updating  product  information  and/or  risk  management  plan 
The  MAH  concludes  that  there  is  no need to  update product  information  or the  Risk  Management  Plan. 
The  PRAC  Rapporteur  agrees  that  there  is no strong  evidence  of an  association  between  Vaxzevria  and 
new onset  of  glomerulonephritis  and  nephrotic  syndrome.  However,  cases  of  relapse/flare  up are 
observed.  According to authors,  these  relapses  are managed through standard procedures.  Some 
changes in glomerular filtration were  also measured.  However,  these observations are  not  specific to 
Vaxzevria and  related to other COVID-19  vaccines. 
In consequence,  no update  to the  Sm PC  or RMP is  warranted  for  Vaxzevria  at  this  stage. 
In the next  PBRER,  the  MAH  is  requested to  further search for literature  on  GN/SN following 
COVID-19 vaccination,  with a special  focus to Adena-vectored  vaccines,  relapse  and  flare  up, 
and measured kidney alterations  after  vaccination.  [Request for the  next  PBRER]

2.3.28.  Health Authority  requests  - Rhabdomyolysis 
Please  note  that  data on Rhabdomyo/ysis is not  reproduced here  (Section  1 5.2. 9  of the PBRER). 
MAH's summary 
Rhabdomyolysis  was  actively  monitored  in  UMC's signal  detection  activities  for COVID-19 vaccines  due  to 
it  being  marked  as an  AESI.  WHO identified signal  of rhabdomyolysis for COVID-19 vaccines. 
The  incidence  of  Rhabdomyolysis  in  general  population  is unknown.  On  literature  review McKenna  MC  et 
al 2019  is  concerned  with the incidence rate  in hospitalised patients.  Rhabdomyolysis is  known  to  occur 
naturally  at an  overall  annual  incidence  of 59  cases  per 100,000  persons  (McKenna  MC  et  al  2019)  per 
annum.  The  natural  aetiology  is  multifactorial but  includes  traumatic  injury,  exertion,  medicines, 
infections  and  metabolic  causes.  The classic  presentation  is  of  muscle  pain,  weakness,  pigmenturia,  and  a 
marked elevation  of serum  CPK  five to  ten  times above  the  upper limit of normal  (ULN)  serum  levels 
(Chavez  L O  et al  2016). 
Ninety-two  (92)  Rhabdomyolysis cases  were reported globally  and  included  in AstraZeneca's post­
marketing database.  Cases  were  assessed  by  age,  sex,  type  of event,  and  outcome.  The  characteristics  of 
the events  and  of the  individuals with  events  were  as  expected for the  general  population,  including the 
observation  of increased  incidence  in  the  elderly.  No usual trends  or clusters  were  identified.  The  time to 
onset  (TTO)  was available in 63  (68. 5% )  case  reports and ranged from  O  days  to  266  days  (median:  3 
days).  Of 63  cases,  51  (81. 0%) cases were within TTO range  of 1-42  days. 
Of 92  cases,  54  (58. 7% )  cases  were reported with PT of  Rhabdomyolysis  and  in 2  (2. 2%) cases  the CPK 
value were more than 1000 U/L with PT Muscle  necrosis and Myopathy  along with additional  symptoms of 
muscle pain and muscle  weakness.  In 33  cases,  Rhabdomyolysis was not reported as a PT (with  CPK 
value not stated)  and  in 3 cases CPK was less than 1000  U/L without  Rhabdomyolysis  reported.  Hence 
these 36  cases  were unlikely to meet the  definition  of Rhabdomyolysis.  Of 92 cases,  56 cases  were 
considered for WHO-UMC causality.  None  of the  cases met WHO-UMC criteria for Certain  or 
Probable/Likely.  62.5%  were  considered as  Possible,  14. 3%  were considered  as  Unlikely,  1. 8%  were 
Conditional/Unclassified and  21.4%  were considered as  Unassessable/Unclassifiable  related to 
VAXZEVRIA.  Amongst 56  cases,  46.4%  were  identified  with  relevant risk/confounding  factors  and 53. 6% 
cases had  limited information  for  a comprehensive causal assessment. 
Of 92  cases,  there  were 4  fatal  cases  which were assessed  as  Possible  as  per WHO-UMC  causality  (3 
cases  had  relevant  confounders  and 1  case  had  limited  information). 
The  O/E analysis  results  for rhabdomyolysis  showed  observed cases  to  be  significantly  less  than  expected 
for  all  age and Global and  EU/UK reports. 
In summary,  the  review of available data  from  spontaneous  reports  regarding rhabdomyolysis  did not 
identify an  index case  or  other  evidence  of a new or  emerging signal. 
MAH's conclusion 
Based  on  the  currently  available  cumulative data,  AstraZeneca considers  that  there  is  insufficient 
evidence  to suggest a causal  relationship  between  VAXZEVRIA  and  Rhabdomyolysis.  It is AstraZeneca' s 
opinion that  no update  to the CDS  or RMP is  warranted  at  this  time. 
Rhabdomyolysis  is  an  AESI  for  VAXZEVRIA  and  will continue  to  be  kept under close  surveillance by 
AstraZeneca.  AstraZeneca will no longer discuss the topic in  future  PBRERs,  unless significant  new safety 
information  arises.

MAH's summary 
Overall medical summary of all case  reports:  Cumulatively through OLP (28 June  2022),  a  total  of 
383  reports  of  eDM  with  the  use  of  VAXZEVRIA  have  been received,  of  which  53. 0%  of the  reported cases 
were  serious and 46. 9%  were  non-serious.  12 fatal  events were reported,  all  of them were  confounded  by 
pre-existing  inadequate  control  of  DM,  or by  other  strong confounding  factors  or were  not the direct 
cause  of death.  The age range  was  20  to 89  years  and  median  age  was  reported as 57  years.  More cases 
were reported for  adult  patients  compared  to the  elderly,  63.8%  and 29. 4% ,   respectively,  and more 
cases  were reported for female that  for male  vaccinees,  60. 8%  and 38. 9%,  respectively.  30. 5%  of cases 
were  medically confirmed and 69.5%  were consumer reports. 
Most of the  cases  were reported  after the  first  dose  of VAXZEVRIA,  280  (73. 3% ).  There  were no case 
reports  identified  with rechallenge  for  eDM  after the  first  dose  and  second dose  of  vaccination. 
Of the serious  cases,  the  most  were  medically  important,  77. 5%,  followed by hospitalization,  26. 0% ,  life 
threatening,  13. 2%,  disability,  10.8%  and  fatal,  5. 9%. 
For eDM, the most common PTs  reported were  Blood glucose  increased  (166),  Hyperglycaemia  (116), 
Diabetes  mellitus inadequate control  (48),  Blood glucose fluctuation (38)  and  Diabetic ketoacidosis (20). 
The  most  commonly co-reported events  were  Pyrexia (25. 8%) and Headache (28. 4%). 
PRAC PSUR assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  8 5/123 
The TTO  was  reported  in 348  (90.8%) cases.  The  median TTO  was  0  days  (median)  respectively.  TTO 
ranged from  O to 213  days,  and was  unknown  in 35  (9. 1%) case  reports. 
Amongst 383  cases,  118 had a  reported  outcome  recovered  or recovered with sequelae.  The  majority  of 
the events  were  reported as  recovered  at  time  of reporting,  and  the  different case  report  source  was  as 
followed:  Clinical  trial  (2);  Spontaneous  (377);  and  Literature  (4).  Amongst  1188  cases  with reported 
outcome  Recovered  or Recovered with sequelae,  the  event duration was  reported  in 43  [36. 1 %]  cases. 
The  mean duration was  7. 0  days.  For 36  cases  (83. 7%  of the  events with reported duration),  the  events 
of interest resolved within  7  days  and  for the  remaining 7  (16. 3% ) cases the  events  resolved between 8 
and 77  days  after  onset. 
The  majority  of case  reports  cumulatively through O LP  (28 June 2022),  62.4%  contained  insufficient 
information  to confirm  causality  assessment.  A  total  of  30.5%  of eDM cases  included  relevant 
risk/confounding factors. 
On  further WHO  UMC case causality  analysis  conducted  for case  reports  of  eDM,  none  were considered  as 
certain  or  probable  and 10.2%  were  considered unlikely related to  VAXZEVRIA.  About,  69. 5%  case 
reports  were  assessed  as  possibly  related  to  VAXZEVRIA,  however these  cases  had  either limited 
information or  presence alternate etiologies. 
Overall,  none  of the case  reports  raised  any new relevant safety concerns for  eDM  cumulatively till O LP, 
and we are  not  aware of any  specific  biological mechanism through which VAXZEVRIA vaccine could 
cause eDM. 
MAH's conclusion 
AstraZeneca was  requested  to  provide a cumulative  review on  exacerbations of type 1/type 2  mellitus 
diabetes  in vaccinees  who  received  VAXZEVRIA  based on  the corresponding signal identified by WHO 
UMC.  WHO UMC  identified  90  case  reports  of  exacerbation  of  diabetes,  that  includes 22  cases  for 
VAXZEVRIA.  However,  lack  of information  available  in  the reports  precluded  any  conclusions  on  the 
impact  of the  hyperglycaemia  exacerbation.  The  report  also included cases  and  case  series  published  in 
the literature,  a hypothetical  mechanism  of such toxicity,  and  recommendations  from  medical societies, 
which contained  no official recommendations  regarding  the  use  of  vaccines  in  patients  with  diabetes. 
WHO-UMC concluded  that  these  findings  do not  amount  to a contraindication  of COVID-19 vaccination  in 
patients  with these  conditions.  On  review of the WHO UMC signal report,  AstraZeneca have  found  that  the 
report  does  not contain  definitive  evidence  on  causal  association  between  VAXZEVRIA  and  exacerbation  of 
diabetes. 
Based  on  the  currently  available  cumulative  data,  AstraZeneca considers  that  there  is  insufficient 
evidence  to suggest a causal  relationship  between  eDM  and  VAXZEVRIA.  It  is  the  opinion of AstraZeneca 
that  no  changes  to the CDS or RMP are  warranted at this  time. 
AstraZeneca will continue  to  monitor  safety  information  for  eDM as part  of the  routine safety  surveillance 
activities  for VAXZEVRIA.  AstraZeneca will not discuss  the topic  future  PBRERs,  unless  significant new 
safety information arises. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
As requested  by  PRAC rapporteur,  the  MAH presented a cumulative  review of the  cases and  a  discussion 
on  the WHO-UMC  identified  signal  (12.04. 2022)  of  exacerbation  of  Diabetes  Mellitus  (O LP 28 June  2022). 
The  MAH's  database  search  retrieved 383 cases  (409 events)  with  history of  DM  were further 
analysed  for  exacerbation  of type  1/type  2  mellitus  diabetes  (eDM). 
Most of cases (53%) were considered serious,  including 12 cases with a fatal outcome.

t 
Most of cases (73%)  occurred after the  p
dose.  No case  of rechallenge  was  identified. 
Vaccinee  age  ranged from  20  to 89 (median:  57  years),  and 244 (63.8%) reports  referred to adult 
vs 113  (29.4%)  to  elderly  vaccinees,  in 26  case  reports  age group was  not available. 
A  slight gender imbalance  was  observed  with 233  (60. 8%) cases  reported in  female. 
Blood glucose increased  (n=166,  43.340/o)and  Hyperglycaemia  (n=115,  30%)  were the  most 
frequently  reported  events  of interest  events,  respectively. 
TTO ranged from  O to 213  days (median:  0 days);  and  most  of the  cases occurred within 0-5 days 
(n= 315,  85%  cases)  of  vaccination. 
When  a  recovered  outcome  was  reported,  the  mean  event  duration  was  7  days  ( duration  reported  in 43 
[36. 1 %]  cases). 
Cases  with fatal outcome:  Fatal outcome was reported in 12 cases,  of which 5  (41. 7%) were  medically 
confirmed.  Diabetic  ketoacidosis  (n=5,  41,  46.6%),  Blood  glucose  increased  (n=3, 42,  24% ),  and 
hyperglycaemia  (n= 3,  42,  24% )  were the  most  frequently  reports  PTs associated  with fatal  outcome 
cases,  respectively.  Overall,  the TTO  was  reported for 10  of the 12 fatal  events  and  ranged from  0  to 213 
days after receiving vaccine.  The  risk window for TTO was considered to  be  between 0 and  7  days, 
inclusive.  Of the  12 fatal case  reports  the WHO-UMC causality was  considered possibly related  in 5 
(41. 7%) cases,  unlikely related  in 5  (41.7%) cases  due  to TTO  being  outside  the  risk window,  and  in 2 
(16. 7%) cases  it  was  considered to  be  unassessable  due  to unknown TTO.  The  MAH  explained that  the 
Diabetic  ketoacidosis  was  reported  in  all cases  assessed as  possibly  related,  all the  cases  contained  strong 
confounding factors:  inadequate control  or compliance  in 2  cases,  concurrent  pneumonia,  recently 
developed  circulatory  collapse  and myocardial  infarction.  All  remaining  fatal cases also  reported 
confounding factors  or alternative  explanation.  This  is  accepted. 
According to the WHO-UMC causality scale,  most  cases,  266  (69. 5%) were  assessed  as  possibly related 
to  VAXZEVRIA,  including 169  cases with limited information and 97  cases  with  possible confounders. 
Other cases  were classified as unassessable/unclassifiable (78;  20.4%) or unlikely related  (39;  10. 2%). 
Literature:  15 articles were identified in  a literature search but none  of them were considered relevant for 
further evaluation  and  presentation. 
Conclusion 
Overall,  the  review of cases shows  a temporal relationship where  majority  of the  events  occurred within 0 
to 5  days  post  vaccination.  However,  most  of the cases  (69. 5%) lack  sufficient  information  for  an  in­
depth medical evaluation.  Besides,  the 5  fatal cases considered possibly related  (WHO-UMC)  were 
strongly confounded.  It is agreed that available  information do not  raise  any  new safety  concern  and 
Exacerbation  of  type 1/type 2 mellitus diabetes  will  not  be  further  discussed  in next  PBRERs, 
unless significant new  safety information arises.

Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
As requested  by  PRAC rapporteur,  the  MAH presented a cumulative The  MAH presented a cumulative 
review  of the  cases and  a  discussion  on  the WHO-UMC  identified signal  (12. 04. 2022)  of adrenal 
insufficiency. 
The  MAH's  search  retrieved  a total  of 86  case  reports,  cumulatively,  of which 25  case  reports  had  pre­
existing  medical history  of adrenal  disease  suggesting  Exacerbation  of Adrenal  Insufficiency.  All cases 
were  serious,  but  none  was  fatal.  7  cases  were  medically confirmed.  6  (24%)  cases  were  reported  after 
the first dose  and 1  after second  dose. 
Adrenocortical  insufficiency  (n= 15,  57. 7%) and acute adrenal insufficiency  (n= l0,  38. 5% )  were the  most 
reported events  followed by Addison' s  disease  (n= l,  3. 8%). 
Vaccinee age (reported  in 24 case)  ranged 18 to 78 years  (median:  58. 5  years) and 17  (70. 8%) cases 
concerned  females  vs  7  cases  reported  in  males. 
PRAC PSUR assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  88/123 
TTO  was  known  in 13 case  reports  and  ranged  from  O  to 30  days  (median:  0  day).  Most  of the  cases 
occurred within  1 day  (n = 7, 53.84%) and 1-14 days  (n= S,  38.4%). 
The  baseline status  of the adrenal  insufficiency at the time of  vaccination was provided  in only one case 
which had  history  of several  years  with adrenal fatigue;  and 22  patients  with history  of adrenal 
insufficiency had  steroid  therapy  in  their history  or were  concomitantly  treated  with steroids at  the  time 
of the  vaccination. 
Outcome  was  reported  as  follows:  46.1%  (12/26)  of  the  events  were  favourable  (resolved  or 
resolving),  7. 8%  (2/26)  of the  events  was  not  recovered/not  resolved.  The  outcome  of the  remaining 
46. 1 %  (12/26)  of  events  were reported  as  unknown or not  reported. 
According  to WHO-UMC causality  analysis,  17 cases  were assessed as possible  with  risk 
factors/ confounders.  8  cases  were Unassessable/Unclassifiable with risk factors/confounders  and 8 
were  Unassessable/Unclassifiable  with limited information. 
Considering the  exposure  to  Vaxzevria,  the  reporting rate for  Exacerbation  of Adrenal  Insufficiency  is 
quite  low. 
Literature:  5 articles were identified in  the  literature search including 2 relevant articles (Maguire et al 
2021  and  Varona  et al 2021)  for further  discussion.  These were  literature case  reports  with  Vaxzevria 
Mechanism  of action:  The  MAH discussed  the  publication  of  Zhao  and Wu  2022  who  summarized  the 
influence  of  COVID-19  vaccines  on  the  endocrine  system  and  explored  the  pathogenic  mechanisms.  The 
authors  hypothesised  that  autoimmune/inflammatory  syndrome  induced  by  vaccine  adjuvants  (ASIA) 
could be one of the possible  mechanisms.  ASIA  has  been  suggested  in  the  past  to  explain  some  AEs  (e.g. 
type 1  diabetes,  primary  ovarian  failure,  etc)  observed  after several  vaccines  (e.g.  HVP,  HBV,  Flu). 
However,  ASIA  remains  an  hypothetical  mechanism  that  need to be confirmed. 
Conclusion 
Overall,  data  that  are  currently  available  do not  suggest any  new safety  concern.  Exacerbation of 
Adrenal insufficiency  will  not  be  further discussed  in next  PBRERs,  unless significant  new 
safety information arises.  This is  endorsed. 
2.3.31.  Health Authority requests - Exacerbation  of  Hypertension 
Please  note  that  data on Exacerbation of Hypertension is not  reproduced here  (Section  1 5. 2. 1 0. 3  of the 
PBRER). 
MAH's summary 
Overall medical summary of all case  reports:  Cumulatively through OLP (28 June  2022),  a  total  of 
129  reports  of  exacerbation  of hypertension  with  the  use  of  VAXZEVRIA  have  been  received,  of which 
54%  were serious  and 46%  were  non-serious.  The  age  range  was  33  to 94  years and  mean and  median 
age  was  reported  as  63  years  and 63. 5  years,  respectively.  Forty  two  (42% )  of cases  were  medically 
confirmed and 58%  were  consumer reports. 
Cumulatively through OLP (28 June 2022)  of the  129 cases,  the TTO was  reported  in 105  (81 % ) cases. 
The  mean  and  median TTO was  12 days and 127  days  respectively. 
Amongst 129  events  received cumulatively through OLP (28 June 2022),  65  (50%) events  had a reported 
outcome  recovered  or recovered with sequelae. 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  89/123 
One event  in 129  case  reports  (0. 7% )  was  reported with fatal  outcome  cumulatively through OLP [28 
June 2022],  which was  non-medically  confirmed.  There  was  insufficient  information  on  the  baseline 
control status  and clinical course  of  hypertension,  and the fatal  outcome  is  likely  due  to the  multiple  co­
morbidities. 
Cumulatively through OLP (28 June 2022),  of the  129 case  reports  reporting the  exacerbation  of 
hypertension with  VAXZEVRIA use,  there  was  1  (0. 7% )  case  report with potential recurrence/rechallenge. 
These 129 case  reports  received cumulatively through OLP (28 June 2022)  were  analysed by AstraZeneca 
and found to have  limited information  (including  information on  baseline control  of hypertension, 
prior/ongoing therapy  and  treatment  information)  and/or  are  confounded by alternative  aetiologies 
including the  possibility  of a concurrent COVID-19  infection. 
Upon  further WHO-UMC case causality  analysis conducted for the  129  case  reports,  the majority  of case 
reports  (108  [84%]) were  considered possibly related to  VAXZEVRIA.  However,  95  of these  108  (88% ) 
case  reports  also  demonstrated  possible  risk factors/confounders and 13 of these  108  (12%) cases  had 
limited  information  to  confirm  causality  assessment. 
literature summary:  12 articles  were  identified from  a cumulative  literature  search,  of which none  were 
considered  relevant  for further evaluation  and  presentation  as  they  discussed either non-hypertension 
related adverse  events  or  mRNA  based  vaccine  events. 
Literature review cumulatively though 28 June,  2022  did not  identify any  article  elucidating a  possible 
pathogenic  mechanism  leading to exacerbation  of hypertension  with VAXZEVRIA. 
MAH's conclusion 
Based  on  the  currently  available data,  AstraZeneca considers  that  there  is  currently  insufficient evidence 
of a causal association between Exacerbation of hypertension  and  VAXZEVRIA.  It is AstraZeneca's opinion 
that  no  changes  to the CDS or RMP are  warranted at this  time . .  AstraZeneca will continue  to  monitor 
safety information  for  Exacerbation of hypertension  as  part  of the ongoing safety  surveillance  activities 
for  VAXZEVRIA.  AstraZeneca will not  discuss  the  topic future  PBRERs,  unless significant new safety 
information  arises. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
As requested  by  PRAC rapporteur,  the  MAH presented a cumulative The  MAH presented a cumulative 
review  of the  cases and  a  discussion  on  the WHO-UMC  identified signal  (12. 04. 2022)  of  Exacerbations  of 
Hypertension 
The  MAH's  search retrieved a total  of 129  case  reports  of  exacerbation  of hypertension reporting 129 
events,  including  70 serious  case  reports  and 54  ( 42%)  medically confirmed reports .  115(89%)  cases 
were reported after the first  dose,  8(6% )  after the second  dose  and 1  (0. 7% )  after the  third  dose. 
There was  1  case of rechallenge  (AE reported  after both  dose 1 and  dose 2)  which was  fatal. 
Vaccinee  age  was  reported  in 119  case  reports  and  ranged 33  to 94  years  (median  age:  63.5  years).  Of 
the 129 case  reports,  102 (79% )  cases  concerned  patients  > 50  years  old and  most  of cases  73%  (93) 
concerned female  patients. 
TTO  was  known  in 105  (81 %)  case  reports  and  ranged  from  O  days  to  254  days  (median TIO:  12  day). 
Most of the cases occurred within 1 day  (n= 47,  44.7%) and 2-5 days  (n=5, 28.5%). 
The AE outcome was reported  in 49%  (63/129) as favourable  (resolved  or resolving),  1 %  (2/129)  of the 
events  were  recovered/resolved with sequelae,  and 25%  (32/129)  of the events  were not recovered/  not 
resolved.  One  case  had  a fatal  outcome. 
PRAC PSUR assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  90/123 
In this  fatal  case,  the  patient  experienced  exacerbation  of hypertension after the  first dose,  and  a 
recurrence of  exacerbation  of hypertension  with the  second dose  of vaccination  indicating  potential 
recurrence /  rechallenge.  This  case  report  was  consumer report received from  regulatory  authority.  Fatal 
outcome  was  present  in  this  case 
,  which  is  described  in  fatal  cases  above.  WHO-UMC 
Causality  Assessment for this  case  is Unassessable/Unclassifiable with risk factors/confounders. 
According  to WHO-UMC  causality scale,  95 cases  were  assessed  as possible  with risk factors/confounders 
and 13  cases  as  Possible  with  Limited information.  Other cases  were  Unassessable/Unclassifiable  with risk 
factors/confounders (n=15) and Unassessable/Unclassifiable with limited information  (n= 6). 
Overall,  110  (85% ) cases  were  identified with relevant  risk/confounding factors. 
Literature:  no relevant articles 
Conclusion 
Overall,  data  that  are  currently  available  do not  suggest any  new safety  concern.  Exacerbation of 
Hypertension will not be further discussed in next  PBRERs,  unless significant new safety 
information arises. This  is endorsed. 
2.3.32.  Health Authority requests - PAM  LEG  10 3 :   Review of  pulmonary 
embolism  (PE),  coronary artery disease  (CAD) including myocardial infarction 
( M I)  and  venous  and arterial  thromboses  - Further data  provision 
Following submission  of the  EMA  LEG  procedure (Post-Authorisation Measure  LEG  103)  PRAC  requested 
that  the  following  data should  be  included  in  this  PBRER: 
1.  A review of the literature  for new  publications  on  epidemiologic studies  of interest related to  these 
safety endpoints,  including a  presentation  of a cumulative  overview table of all  epidemiological 
studies  (similar to table  17  of the  assessment report) 
2.  O/E analysis of the  safety endpoints  using data  where age  and  age/gender stratified analysis are 
possible  with reliable estimates of vaccine exposure  (ie,  UK and  EEA data).  Background rates 
used should be  clearly and explicitly documented,  including information that may  be  useful for 
interpretation:  countries,  databases,  time period,  population.  The  MAH should  discuss  the 
comparability  between  the  populations  and  systems  that  give  rise to  the  observed  and  expected 
cases  and  discuss  potential biases giving limitations  in  the comparability.  If the  source  comes 
from  a systematic  review/meta-analysis,  then  reporting ranges and 95%  Cls  of the estimates  can 
also  be  useful  to assess  the  heterogeneity  and  precision  of the estimates. 
Literature  Review 
After careful  review five  articles  discussing  the  association  between  VAXZEVRIA  and  thromboembolism 
were  summarised and added to  the  previous summary  of seven for the  EMA  LEG  procedure.  The  five  new 
articles  are  presented  first  in Table 10 and Table 11  presents  a summary  of large population-based 
studies on  relative  risk or risk  difference  of studied events.

Arterial  thrombosis (ATE), ischaemic  stroke  (IS) and myocardial  infarction  (Ml): 
Six studies  assessed  the association  between  VAXZEVRIA  and  Ml.  Three  (Berild  et al,  2022, ;  Burn et al 
2021a;  Rahman  et  al,  2022)  found no association and two  (Burn et al 2021b;  Whiteley  et  al 2022)  found 
there  was  a decreased risk and  only  one  study  found an  increased risk of  MI post vaccination  (Botton  et 
al 2022). 
Seven studies assessed the  association  between  VAXZEVRIA and  IS (Table 9 and Table  10).  Four found 
no statistically significant associations (Rahman et al,  2022,  Hippisley-Cox  et al 2021,  Botton et al 2022, 
Burn  et  al 2021b)  and  two studies  found  a decreased risk (Whiteley  et al 2022,  Burn  et  al 2021a)  and  one 
found an  increased risk of  IS post vaccination  (Berild et al,  2022). 
Six studies  assessed  the association  between  VAXZEVRIA  and  ATE  (Table 9 and Table  10).  Two studies 
found no  association  (Hippisley-Cox  et  al 2021;  Burn  et al 2021b).  Two  studies  found  a decreased risk 
(Whiteley  et  al 2022,  Burn et al 2021a)  and  two  studies  found  an  increased risk of ATE  post  vaccination 
(Berild  et  al,  2022,  Chen  et al,  2022),  one  of the  studies  was  a meta-analysis assessing  all  viral vector 
vaccines  (Chen et al,  2022). 
Based  on  these  varied results  AstraZeneca cannot draw any  conclusions  on an association between 
VAXZEVRIA vaccination and  arterial thrombosis,  IS or Ml. 
Venous thromboembolism  (VTE),  pulmonary embolism  (PE)  and Cerebrovascular venous  and 
sinus thrombosis (CVST): 
Four studies assessed the association between  VAXZEVRIA  and CVST (Table 9  and Table 10),  one of 
which reported  a statistically  significant association  (Hippisley-Cox  et al 2021).  Five  studies assessed the 
association  between  VAXZEVRIA  and  PE,  two  of which found no association,  one  reported  a  decreased 
risk in  those  70  or  over,  and  two found an  increased risk after  VAXZEVRIA  vaccination.  Eleven  studies 
assessed  the association  between  VAXZEVRIA  and VTE,  two  reported  no  statistically  significant 
association  and  one  reported  a decreased risk in  those  70 or  older,  one  reported  a  decreased risk  for 
those  70-79 and  an  increased risk for woman  younger  than 50 and eight  reported  an  increased risk after 
VAXZEVRIA  vaccination. 
The  majority  of the  studies  assessing the association  between  VAXZEVRIA  and  VTE did report  an 
association  between exposure  to AZD1222  and an  increased risk of  VTE.  The  associations  were  found  in 
both SCCS  studies  that  compare  post  vaccination  time to control  time  in  those with the  outcome,  and 
cohort studies  using non-vaccinated  or historical controls.  In the  studies  that  presented  results  stratified 
by sex and age  the  increased risk was  higher,  or  only present  in  younger age  groups  and  in  women 
(Andrews  et al 2022;  Corrao et al,  2022).  Relative  risks by  sex and  age group can  be  found  in  Appendix 
2,  for the studies  where  they  were  available.  The highest  relative  risk was  found  in  Laporte et al 2021, 
who  found  those  vaccinated with VAXZEVRIA had  3. 68  times higher risk of  VTE  compared  to historical 
controls.  This  study  only adjusted  for  sex and age,  and  did not  exclude  participants  with history  of study 
outcomes,  making confounding likely.  Other studies  reported between a 10%  (corresponding to 66  excess 
case per 1  million  vaccinations,  Hippisley-Cox  et al 2021)  and  a 2.43 times increased risk (corresponding 
to 23,207 citizens vaccinated  per one  harmful event  among  women  < 50,  Corrao  et  al,  2022)  and  a risk 
difference  of 8. 35 cases  (95%  CI 0.21 to  16.49)  of DVT per 100  000 vaccinations in  frontline  health care 
personnel consisting mainly  of  younger women  (Hviid et al,  2022).  Though residual confounding  may still 
be present  in  the  studies  reviewed,  a suggestion of a  modest  potential  association between  VAXZEVRIA 
and VTE,  especially in younger women,  requires further review of new  evidence.

MAH's Conclusion 
Both embolic and  thrombotic events and  CAD including  MI occur  in all  ages  and  are  more common as age 
advances.  AstraZeneca  did  not find evidence  of a new or  emerging signal from  review of the O/E analysis. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
Following submission of the  EMA  LEG procedure (Post-Authorisation Measure  LEG  103)  related to 
pulmonary  embolism  (PE),  coronary artery disease  (CAD)  including myocardial infarction (Ml) and venous 
and arterial thromboses,  the following data was  included  in  this  PBRER: 
1.  A review of the literature  for new  publications  on  epidemiologic  studies  of interest related to these 
safety  endpoints. 
Five new articles discussing the  association  between Vaxzevria and  thromboembolism  were  summarised 
and risk estimates were  added  to the  previous  summary  in  the  EMA  LEG  procedure  (Error!  Reference 
source  not found.  and Error!  Reference source not  found.  above). 
Using  a self-controlled case series  (Denmark,  Norway and  Finland),  Berild et al.  found  a small increased 
risk for  venous  (RR 1.83 (1. 56  to  2. 15)) and arterial thrombosis  RR  (2.99 (1. 74-5. 13))  following 
Vaxzvria.  Of note,  small increased  RR  were  also  observed  for  both mRNA  vaccines.  Two  notably  high 
rates  were  observed  following  Vaxzevria:  12. 04  (95%  CI,  5. 37-26. 99)  for  cerebral  venous  thrombosis 
and 4. 29  (95%  CI,  2.96-6.20) for  thrombocytopenia  (both are listed  in  the  EU-SmPC).  The  authors 
discussed  that  a  main  assumption  of the  SCCS  method  is  that  experiencing a study  event  does  not 
influence  the  subsequent  probability  of  getting  vaccinated.  This  bias  is  difficult  to adjust  for,  and 
therefore,  they  included  a post  hoc  negative  control  outcome.  For this  post  hoc  analysis  on  Finnish and 
Danish data,  the authors  performed  a  similar  analysis using femoral fracture  as  a negative  control 
outcome.  Femoral fracture  is  especially common  in  elderly  individuals  and may result  in  long-term 
incapacity  which  may  affect  the  probability  of  being vaccinated.  They found an  association of  femoral 
fracture  with  COVID-19  vaccinations,  up  to a RR  of 2,  cautioning that  the  SCCS method  may yield weak 
but positive associations because  of this bias.  Thus,  any positive  low-grade  association  for a serious 
outcome  that  may result  in  long-term incapacity should  be interpreted with caution. 
The SCCS  by Rahman  et al.  (Malaysia)  noted  a small  increased risk of  VTE  following Vaxzevria  (IRR 
2. 22;  95%  CI 1. 17-4. 21)  and Comirnaty  (IRR 1. 24;  95%  CI  1. 02-1.49).  The authors noted  that  the  weak 
association  required further consideration of the clinical importance  of the  results. 
A  systematic review and meta-analysis  by Chen  et al.  noted a small increased risk of VTE (RR 1. 128; 
95%  CI 1. 023-1. 244)  and ATE (RR 1. 167;  95%  CI 1. 103-1. 234)  for the  viral vector vaccines (these 
included Ad26. COV2.S,  ChAdOxl and Sputnik  V). 
A cohort study  from  Italy  by Corrao et al.  noted  an  increased  risk of VTE,  only  in  women  <  50  years 
(IRR of 2.4,  95%  CI 1. 1-5. 6),  but  not  in  other  age groups  or  in  men.  Hviid et al.  (Denmark)  performed 
a cohort  study  in  frontline  personnel  and noted a significant  risk  difference  at  28  days  for DVT (RD 8. 35 
[95%  CI 0. 21 to 16. 49]  per 100 000  vaccinations),  but  not for CVST  or  thrombocytopenia  following 
Vaxzevria. 
2.  O/E analysis:  these  analyses did not  find  evidence  of a new or  emerging signal. 
Overall,  regarding  arterial thrombosis,  ischaemic  stroke,  myocardial  infarction  and  pulmonary  embolism, 
the data  do  not raise  new safety  concerns and these  events do not need to  be  further discussed as part of 
the health authority  requests,  unless  significant  new safety  information  is  identified.  Thrombosis  will 
continue  to be  monitored  as  an  EU-specific  important potential risk (see  Section 2.3. 5). 
Regarding venous  thromboembolism,  some literature data  suggest  a possible  relationship with Vaxzevria, 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  98/123 
but  the  findings are not consistent  across  studies  and residual confounding cannot be ruled out.  To 
address the  inconsistent risk estimations of venous thromboembolism observed  in the 
literature studies,  the  MAH should further  investigate this topic  by providing  an  updated 
literature review,  with  a  focus on  new  relevant  epidemiological  studies.  [Request for the  next 
PBRER] 
Moreover,  the  MAH  is  asked to discuss the  interest of conducting  a meta-analysis  of all 
available  data  from the  MAH  studies  as  well  as any  published  studies  in the next  PBRER.

2.3.33.  Health Authority  requests  - Viral  reactivation  (Non-zoster) 
Please note  that  data on  Viral  reactivation  (Non-zoster) is not  reproduced here (Section 1 5. 2. 1 3  of the 
PBRER). 
MAH's summary 
Overall medical summary of all case  reports:  Cumulatively through OLP 28 June  2022  a  total  of 56 
reports  of  Viral  reactivation  (Non-Zoster) with the  use of  VAXZEVRIA have  been  received,  of which 92.9% 
of the reported  events were serious.  The age range was 22  to 88 years and mean and median age was 
reported as  51  years  and 49. 5  years,  respectively.  The  cases  were  predominantly  in  females  (55.4%). 
Of the 56 reports,  25. 0%  of cases  of  Viral  reactivation  (Non-Zoster)  occurred  after the first  dose  and 
8. 9%  after the second  dose.  The  dose  number was  unknown  in 64. 3%  of cases. 
One case  (1. 8%) was  reported  with a fatal  outcome,  however,  the cause of  death confirmed  by  autopsy 
was an  ischaemic stroke,  co-reported hepatitis  B  assessed by  reporter as  serious due  to hospitalization, 
ischemic stroke  was  also assessed as  a  life-threatening  event,  a  viral  reactivation could  not be 
comprehensively confirmed  as there was insufficient  information  on previous  HBV  DNA status.  Two  more 
events  were  reported as  life threatening.  The first event  of hepatitis  E was  reported  as a life threatening, 
however,  a  viral reactivation could not  be  comprehensively confirmed as  there  was  insufficient 
information  on  previous hepatitis  E history.  The second  event  of herpes  simplex  encephalitis  was  reported 
by consumer as  a life threatening,  however,  there  is a  limited  information  on patient concomitant 
medications and  comorbidities  that  precluded a  proper  assessment. 
Of the 56 cases,  38  (67. 9%) were  assessed  as "Possible  with  Limited information" and 13 (23. 2%) as 
"Possible  with risk factors/confounders".  One case  (1. 8%) was  considered "Probable-Likely".  Although the 
patient had  viral serology  findings  suggesting  past  infection  of  EBV and CMV,  both viruses  are  known  to 
have  latent  and  lytic  phases.  Reactivation  of  only  one  virus  was  seen  (CMV) and  can  be  explained by viral 
derived factors  (such as  its  known  natural  history).  The  remaining four cases  (7. 1% )  were  assessed as 
"Unlikely". 
Of the four serious  cases highlighted by  PRAC  reported to the  French  pharmacovigilance system,  two 
were  assessed  as "Possible;  with limited information",  one as "Possible;  with alternate  cause  or 
confounders",  and  one  as "Unassessable/Unclassifiable  with  limited  information". 
Overall,  none  of the case  reports  raised  any new  relevant  safety  concerns  for  Viral Reactivation  (Non­
zoster) cumulatively till 28 June 2022. 
literature  summary:  765 articles  were  identified  from  a  cumulative  review  of the  literature.  Of these, 
758  articles  were  considered  irrelevant  for further evaluation  and  presentation  based  on  the  topic  of 
interest "virus  reactivation  in  association  with VAXZEVRIA  and  other  COVID19  vaccines". 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report

Page  99/123 
Seven literature  case  reports  of  viral reactivation  were  identified;  the cases  were reviewed  as part  of 
Global Safety  Database  review.  On  review of any remaining case  report  articles,  no new safety concerns 
were  identified. 
MAH's  conclusion 
Based  on  the  review of the  currently  available cumulative data,  AstraZeneca considers  that  there  is 
insufficient evidence  to suggest  a causal  association with VAXZEVRIA.It is  AstraZeneca's  opinion  that  no 
changes  to  the  CDS  or  RMP  on  this  topic  are  warranted  at  this  time.  Viral  reactivation  will continue  to  be 
monitored  as part of AstraZeneca's  routine  surveillance  activities.  AstraZeneca will no longer  discuss  the 
topic future  PBRERs,  unless  significant  new safety  information  arises. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
Cumulatively through OLP 28 June 2022  a total of 56 reports of Viral  reactivation  (Non-Zoster)  with 
Vaxzevria  have  been  received,  92.9%  of the  reported  events  were  serious.  The  age  range  was  22  to 88 
years and  mean and  median  age  was  reported as 51  years and 49. 5  years,  respectively.  The  cases  were 
predominantly  in  females  (55. 4%). 
25.0% of cases  of  Viral reactivation  (Non-Zoster)  occurred  after the first dose and 8.9%  after the 
second  dose.  The  dose number was  unknown  in 64. 3%  of cases. 
One case  (1.8%) was  reported with a fatal  outcome,  however,  the cause of  death confirmed  by 
autopsy  was an  ischaemic stroke,  co-reported  with hepatitis  B  assessed  by  reporter as  serious  due  to 
hospitalization,  ischemic  stroke was also assessed as a life-threatening event,  and  a viral reactivation 
could not  be  comprehensively confirmed  as  there  was insufficient information  on  previous  HBV  DNA 
status. 
Two more  events were reported as  life threatening.  The  first event  of hepatitis  E was  reported  as  a 
life threatening,  however,  a viral reactivation  could not  be  comprehensively confirmed  as  there was 
insufficient information  on previous  hepatitis  E history.  The  second  event  of herpes simplex  encephalitis 
was  reported by consumer as  a life threatening,  however,  there  is a limited information  on patient 
concomitant  medications and  comorbidities  that  precluded a  proper assessment. 
Of the 56 cases,  38  (67.9%) were assessed as "Possible  with  Limited  information" and 13 
(23.2%)  as "Possible  with risk  factors/confounders".  One  case  (1.8%)  was considered 
" Probable-Likely". The  remaining four cases  (7. 1%) were assessed  as "Unlikely". 
Seven literature  case  reports  of  viral reactivation  were  identified;  the cases  were reviewed  as part  of the 
Global Safety Database review.  On  review of any remaining case  report  articles,  no new safety  concerns 
were  identified. 
The  MAH considers  that  there  is  insufficient  evidence  to suggest  a causal association with  Vaxzevria and 
that  that  no  changes  to the CDS or RMP on  this topic  are warranted  at  this  time.  The  MAH will continue  to 
monitor viral reactivation as  part  of AstraZeneca's routine surveillance activities.  This  is endorsed. 
Although there  are  a number of  possible cases  and  one  case  that  is probable,  given  the  large  exposure 
and the  fact  that  viral activation  took  place  for  a diverse range  of viruses,  makes  that  the  uncertainty  is 
large. 
Cases of Viral reactivation  (Non-Zoster)  do not need to  be  further discussed through  PBRERs 
unless significant new  safety information is identified.

2.3.34.  Health Authority  requests  - Cutaneous vasculitis 
The  signal  of cutaneous  vasculitis  was  identified in April 2022  during AstraZeneca's routine  surveillance 
activities  from  series  of  published literature  case  reports.  Subsequently  on 23 June 2022,  in  the  updated 
PSUR AR,  PRAC  requested AstraZeneca to  assess cutaneous  vasculitis  (external)  in  the upcoming  PBRER 
(O LP:  28 June 2022).  AstraZeneca  internally validated  the  signal  on 15 July 2022. 
Please note  that  Cutaneous  vasculitis  data is not  reproduced here  (see Appendix  1 6  of the PBRER  and 
Addendum  to Clinical  Overview on  Cutaneous  Vasculitis). 
MAH's Summary 
CV is  a not an  uncommon  disorder,  and  is  characterized by  an  inflammation  of the  blood  vessel  walls and 
skin lesions.  The  condition  is self-limited and  spontaneously  resolves  within 2  to 4  weeks. 
Pre-clinical/Clinical  studies:  no data  /  no  events  of  cutaneous  vasculitis. 
Cumulative  review of cases  (OLP 28 June 2022):  258  case  reports  with 258  events  were  identified. 
Majority  of the  adverse events  (AEs)  were  serious  (91. 9%). 
Gender/Age:  There  was a higher  female  (59. 3%) to  male  (40. 7% )  ratio with a median  age  of  61  years. 
ITO:  83%  of AEs  were reported within  a TTO  of 14  days;  of which 61.5%  occurred  :,;  7  days  and 33. 7% 
in  :,;  3 days after vaccination (any dose). 
Dose:  In 90.5%  of cases,  the  event  occurred  after the  first  dose;  in  7. 8%  cases  after the  second dose, 
and 3.5%  cases reported CV  after both  doses  (12 cases of  rechallenge). 
Outcome:  Recovered/recovering  in 69. 5%  of cases;  Not recovered in 23. 6%  of cases (at  the  time  of 
reporting).  However,  due  to the  self-limiting  nature  of the  event and  the  fact  that  most  of the  cases  are 
consumer reports  received  via regulatory  authorities,  follow-up  information  is  rarely  available. 
BCC  criteria  and  causality assessment{WHO-UCM criteria 7:  2 cases  were assessed  as BCC  Level  1,  16 
cases  as BCC  Level  2,and 240 cases  as BCC  Level 3,  according to  BCC classification Zanoni  et  al 
2016.  Out  of these 258  cases,  1 case  was  assessed  as  Certain,  3 cases  Probable,  and 156  of cases 
were  assessed  as  Possible  with  limited  information  according  to WHO-UMC  classification. 
Among the  258 cases,  there  were 20  histopathology confirmed cases,  of which there  was  1 "Certain" case 
and 2 "Probable"  cases  according  to WHO-UMC  causality  criteria. 
Among the  258 cases,  there  were 12  cases  reported recurrence or  worsening  (interpreted  as 
rechallenge) of  CV after  receiving  a  second  dose  of  VAXZEVRIA.  According  to  BCC classification,  10 
cases  were  assessed  as  Level  3,  1  as Level  2  and  the remaining  as Level  1.  Using  WHO-UMC 
classification,  1 case  was assessed as  Certain  and majority (9)  of the  remaining cases  were assessed as 
Possible  with limited information  such  medical history,  concomitant  medications,  risk factors, 
etiologic  and  diagnostic  workup.  However,  due  to the recurrence and  temporal relationship to  both  doses, 
causality  with VAXZEVRIA cannot be excluded. 
Observed  versus  expected analysis: The results  showed  observed cases  to  be  less than  or  significantly 
less than  expected for  global cases,  and  for  all  age and  gender stratifications,  using the risk windows of 
14  and 42  days,  and also including  cases  with unknown  time to onset. 
There are several uncertainties and  assumptions  to the  OE analysis,  including potential  under-reporting, 
appropriateness  of  background  incidence  rates  used,  and possible  misclassification of cases  of  CV. 
Literature review  - Mechanism of A ction:  A  cumulative  literature search retrieved 2 relevant articles 
that  hypothesized potential mechanisms  with  COVID-19  vaccines leading to  CV.  The hypothesised 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  101/123 
mechanisms  include an  inflammatory  response  to vaccine  component/antigen  encoding SARS CoV 2  spike 
glycoprotein,  depositing  in micro-vessels,  targeting vascular endothelium and  resulting  in  a neutrophil­
rich inflammatory reaction  possibly due  to the  molecular  mimicry  between  SARS CoV-2 and vaccine 
components  such the  spike  protein.  Another hypothesis  involved  activation  of autoreactive  B/T  cells, 
antibody  formation,  and  immune  complex  deposition within  small  vessels,  leading to activation  of  the 
complement  system  and  recruitment  of leukocytes.  However,  these broad  mechanisms  remain 
speculative  given the  absence of a specific  immune  mechanism,  mediators  or pathway. 
MAH's conclusion:  Based  on  the evaluation  of currently  available information  from various  sources, 
AstraZeneca  has  determined  that there  is  a  reasonable  possibility  of a causal  association  between 
Vaxzevria  and CV. 
Vaxzevria  CDS Section  4.8  (undesirable effects)  is updated  to  include 'Cutaneous  vasculitis'  with 
frequency of not known  (considering the  post-marketing setting).  When  used  in  accordance  with the 
revised  prescribing  information,  the  benefits  of  Vaxzevria  continue  to outweigh the  risks. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
The  MAH provided an  evaluation  of Cutaneous  vasculitis  [CV] following MAH's and  EMA  identification  of a 
signal  (Appendix 16  of  PBRER and  Clinical  Overview on  CV). 
A  cumulative search (O LP of 28 June 2022)  retrieved 258  cases  reporting an  AE of cutaneous vasculitis: 
118 cases  reported the  PT 'Cutaneous  vasculitis'  and 140  cases  reported  other vasculitis PTs (for which 
CV was  identified  by narrative  review).  Among  the  258  cases,  there  were 20  histopathology  confirmed 
cases,  including 1 case  with  a certain  causal  association  with Vaxzevria and 2  cases  with a  probable 
causality  assessment.  Besides,  12 rechallenge  cases were  identified  (i. e.  recurrence  or worsening  of  CV 
after the  2
Dose),  all confirmed as  BCC  Level 1-3.  The  MAH classified only 1 case with a certain 
nd 
causality  assessment  and considered the  majority  of cases  with a possible  association  with  limited 
information.  This  is questionable  considering the  rechallenge  of CV after the  2
dose. 
nd 
The  MAH also  reviewed  literature  case  reports  highlighted  by  the  EMA.  However,  it  is unclear whether 
those  cases  have  been taken  into account  in  the  cumulative  review or not.  Overall,  the  MAH classified 
those  cases as followed: 
1  case  with BCC  Level 1  and  with a certain causality  assessment; 
9  cases  with  BCC  Level 2,  including 1 case  with  a  probable  causal  association and 8  cases  possibly 
related to  vaccination (5  with limited information and 3  with  possible  confounders);  and 
7  cases  with  BCC  Level  3,  including  1 case  with  a  probable  causality  assessment  and 6 cases  with a 
possible  causal  association  with limited information. 
The  O/E analysis  did not show  an  increased  number of  CV  events  after  Vaxzevria.  However,  the analysis 
has several limitations discussed by  the  MAH and is hardly  conclusive. 
Finally,  different hypotheses  to  explain  a possible  mechanism  of action  have  been proposed. 
Based  on  the  evaluation  of currently  available  information,  the  MAH considers  that there  is  a reasonable 
possibility  of a causal  association  between  Vaxzevria  and cutaneous  vasculitis.  This  is endorsed,  as  well 
as  the  inclusion  of Cutaneous  vasculitis  in Section  4.8 of  SmPC  with a frequency of not known. 
The  proposal  of the MAH of PIL Section 4  is  acknowledged.  The  PRAC  Rapporteur  proposed  to slightly 
update  the  wording to align the signs/symptoms  with the  other vector-based COVID-19  vaccine: 
Not known: inflammation of blood  vessels  in  the  skin,  often with  a  rash iHHI or small red or 
purple,  flat,  round spots under the skin's  surface or bruising {cutaneous  vasculitis)

Potential  mechanism :  The  exact  mech a n i sm  is  u n known .  Several  hypothetical

ChAdOxl  vaccine vector used  i n  VAXZEVRIA a n d  PF4;  however,  it  is u n known 
if the adenoviral  ChAdOxl  i nteraction  with  PF4 is act u a l ly  platelet activating 
or thrombogenic (causal  of blood  clots).  Greinacher et  a l   2 0 2 1   suggested  that 
ChAdOxl  itself or protei n s  conta ined with i n  the vaccine can  b i n d  to  PF4 to 
form  immune  complexes which  may d rive  a  B-ce l l   response  causing  h i g h -titre

CORE  :  core-RMP specific safety concern 
Eu  :  EU- RMP  specific  safety concern 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
During the  period under review,  the following issue was  removed from  the  safety concerns for  Vaxzevria: 
Anaphylaxis  is  no longer considered as  an  Important  Identified  Risk in  the  EU-RMP.  Anaphylaxis has 
been re-classified  as 'non-important  identified risk' because  it  is  now  considered fully characterised 
and no  additional  RMM are  ongoing  or planned. 
3.  Benefit evaluation 
3.1.  Benefits previously identified 
• 
Long-term  efficacy:  D8110C00001  DCO3  (30 July 2021)  supports maintenance  of  efficacy  for  at 
least 6-months  (VE=  66. 98%  and  a lower  bound  of the 95%  CI  of 58. 87% . ).  A  closely similar level of 
efficacy  is  obtained  across  age groups. 
•  Efficacy  against  variants:  overall  VE in  sequenced variants  is similar to the  VE of the primary 
analysis  in  study  D8110C00001.  Preliminary live  virus neutralization data  from exploratory analysis 
suggest that  2-dose primary series immunization  will  likely  provide  protection against  infection  with 
the  Variants  of Concern,  including Omicron,  and clinically  meaningful  protection against 
hospitalization  and  severe  disease  would  be  maintained. 
•  Efficacy  against  variants:  an  AZD1222 booster  in  participants  previously  vaccinated  with a  primary 
series  of  Vaxzevria  or mRNA vaccine,  elicits  strong humoral  immune  responses against  a range  of 
Variants  of Concern  (Flaxman  et  al 2021,  Munro  et al 2021  and  is  likely  to provide  clinically 
meaningful  protection  against  hospitalization  and  severe disease. 
3.2.  New information  on  the benefits 
During the  reporting period  of this  PBRER,  key data  and  relevant  information  became  available  on: 
1)  Long-term  protection  and waning (AstraZeneca sponsored  studies  D8110C00001  and  D8111C00002) 
•  D8110C00001:  90%  of participants  were  unblinded.  For  the primary efficacy endpoints  in  the 
double-blind period  (78  days  for  AZD1222  and  71  days  for  placebo),  vaccine  efficacy  was 67. 0% 
(P> 0. 001).  AZD1222 elicited humoral response over time with waning  is  observed  at day 180. 
PRAC PSUR assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  107 /123 
•  D8111C00002:  in 256  participants  in Japan  across  all age  groups,  and after one  year  of follow up, 
it  was  observed  that  humoral  responses  against  SARS-CoV-2  waned  over time from  previously 
reported peak responses post-second dose.  At  Day 365,  anti-SARS-CoV-2  spike-binding and 
receptor-binding  domain mean antibody  titres  remained  above  Day 15  levels  across  all  ages. 
Neutralizing antibody  titres  declined and  were below  detection  levels  in  many  participants  by  Day 
365. 
2)  Homologous and  Heterologous Third  dose  booster 
•  D7220C00001:  The  humoral  immune response  to  a  booster  dose  of AZD1222  in  participants 
previously vaccinated with  either AZD1222  or an  mRNA  vaccine  was  non-inferior to the  response 
elicited  by primary vaccination  with AZD1222  (AZD1222  cohort GMT ratio:  1. 03  [95%  CI:  0.92 to 
1. 15];  mRNA cohort GMT ratio:  3.08 [95%  CI:  2. 78 to  3.41]); 
•  Xinxue  Liu  et  al.  2022  evaluated  the  persistence  of immunogenicity  after seven  COVID-19 
vaccines given as  third  dose  boosters  following  two  doses  of  VAXZEVRIA  or COMIRNATY  in  the  UK 
over the course  of 3  months. 
The  anti-spike  IgG  in  adenoviral  vector vaccine  arms (ChAd  and  Ad26) after the  BNT/BNT  prime 
showed  the most  persistent  schedules up to  D84.  The immunogenicity at D84  post boost  for  ChAd 
and Ad26  was  similar  to,  or higher than,  the  three dose  BNT  schedule  (BNT/BNT/BNT),  especially 
in  older  people. 
•  RHH-001  (Clemens  et  al 2022),  evaluated  AZD1222  as  a heterologous booster  after  a 2-dose 
primary series  of the  inactivated  whole-virion adjuvanted vaccine CoronaVac.  After 28  days,  all 
heterologous  boosting  elicited  a significantly  superior response  (p< 0. 0001)  in  anti-Spike  IgG 
concentration  and  pseudo-neutralising  titres  compared  to  homologous  boosting  with CoronaVac. 
• 
Jara  et  al 2022  also  evaluated  the  vaccine  effectiveness  of AZD1222  as  a heterologous  booster 
after a 2-dose primary series  of CoronaVac.  Heterologous  boosting  with AZD1222,  following  a 
two-dose  CoronaVac  primary vaccination  series,  yielded  vaccine  effectiveness  of 97 • 7%  (95%  CI: 
97- 3-98-0) against COVID-19-related hospitalisation, 98-9%  (95%  CI:  98- 5% -99- 2% )  against 
ICU admission,  and 98- 1%  (95%  CI:  97- 3-98-6)  against  death. 
•  Mun oz-Valle et al 2022  evaluated AZD1222  as a heterologous  booster  after primary  immunisation 
with the  adenoviral  vector  vaccine Convidecia (CanSino  Biologics  Inc,  China).  At baseline,  the 
median  percentage  of  neutralizing  antibodies  was  similar in  booster  and control groups  (78. 16% 
vs.  78.65%,  p  >  0. 05),  but  at  6  months  post-booster was significantly higher  in  the  boosted 
group  versus controls  (96.41 %  vs.  89. 33% ,  p  =  0. 0004),  with no differences between  vaccines. 
There were  also  no  differences  in  adverse events between  booster vaccines. 
3)  Vaccine effectiveness  against dominant SARS-COV-2  variant  of concern  omicron 
•  A  recent test-negative case-control  study  examined the  VE against  symptomatic  disease  caused 
by the  Delta and  Omicron variants  (Andrews  et  al 2022).  No  effect  against  the  Omicron  variant 
was  observed  from  20  weeks  after  a  primary  vaccination  with  AZD1222,  but  the  VE of a  booster 
dose  was  55.6%  at 2  to 4  weeks  and 46. 7%  at 5  to 9 weeks following booster  administration. 
This  decrease  in  VE was  also noted  with  a third homologous  dose  of  COMIRNATY  and  mRNA-
1273. 
•  A  test-negative  case  control design was  used  to  estimate  the VE of an  AZD1222  or  COMIRNATY 
booster following  a primary series  of AZD1222  against  symptomatic disease  and  hospitalisation 
after infection with the  SARS-CoV-2  Omicron  variant  in  England  (Kirsebom  et al 2022).  Protection 
against symptomatic disease  in  those  aged 65  years and older peaked  at  66. 1 %  and 68.5% 
PRAC PSUR assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  108/123 
among those  who  received AZD1222 and COMIRNATY  boosters,  respectively,  and  waned  to 
44. 5%  and 54. 1 %  after 5  to 9  weeks.  VE against hospitalisation  after  infection  with the SARS­
CoV-2  Omicron variant  peaked  at 82. 3%  after an  AZD1222  booster  and 90.9%  after  a 
COMIRNATY  booster.  The authors  noted  differences  between  the  population  receiving  AZD1222 
and the  population  receiving COMIRNATY,  with those  receiving 3  doses  of AZD1222 more  likely to 
be in risk groups;  this was  also true  for Andrews et al 2022. 
• 
Effectiveness  of a 2-dose primary series  of AZD1222 remains high  (61-71 %  VE) against 
hospitalisation  due  to  Omicron variant  in  individuals 65+  years  of age  in  England  who  completed 
their  primary  series  > 175 days previously  (Kirsebom et al  2022,  Stowe  et al 2022). 
•  At 7+  days  after  a 3rd  dose  AZD1222 booster on  top of an  AZD1222  primary  series,  effectiveness 
against hospitalisation  due  to  the  Omicron variant  is 82%  (95%  CI 64-91% ).  (Kirsebom et al 
2022). 
•  Against  symptomatic Omicron  infection  in Thailand,  AZD1222 given as  a 1st  booster was shown 
to have  26%  VE (95%  CI 8-40),  whilst  AZD1222  as  a 2nd  booster  offered  significantly higher 
protection,  with 71 %  VE (85%  CI 59-79;  Chariyalertsak et al 2022) 
• 
Effectiveness  of hybrid  immunity  (infection plus vaccination)  against  infection  for AZD1222 
vaccine  as  1st booster  peaked at  72. 1 %  (95%  CI:  71. 4-72. 8%) during a  period when  Omicron 
was dominant  in  Brazil.  Protection against severe illness  (hospitalization  or death)  provided  by  a 
1st  booster dose  of AZD1222 peaked  at 98.1%  (95%  CI:  97. 7-98. 5%) during an  Omicron 
predominant  period  (Cerqueira-Silva  et al 2022). 
• 
In a  prison  population  in  Zambia that  included  over 10. 5%  of individuals who  were  living with 
HIV,  effectiveness  of an  AZD1222  primary  series  against  infection  with  Omicron  was  89.4%  (95% 
CI:  59. 5-97. 8%),  whilst  effectiveness  against  symptomatic  infection  with  Omicron was  85.1% 
(95%  CI: 19. 5-98. 0% ;  Simwanza et al 2022). 
4)  R-pharm multicentric study assessing  the safety and  immunogenicity  of interchangeability  of two 
different adenovirus  vector vaccines (rAd26  and  VAXZEVRIA). 
"A  Phase  1/11  Single-Blinded  Randomised Safety and  Immunogenicity Study  in Adults  of  VAXZEVRIA  and 
rAd26-S  Administered  as  Heterologous  Prime  Boost  Regimen  for the  Prevention  of  COVID  19". 
Overall,  AZD1222  and  rAd26  S components  have  demonstrated  an acceptable  safety  profile  with no new 
safety concerns  from  combination  use  of vaccines  (administered  in  either  order)  in healthy adults  without 
known  past  laboratory  confirmed  SARS CoV 2  infection,  positive  SARS  CoV 2 RT  PCR test at  screening,  or 
seropositivity  to SARS CoV 2 at  screening. 
Reactogenicity,  as  evaluated by  the  incidence  of solicited AEs for 7  days  post  each  dose,  appeared  to be 
greater in  the sequence AZD1222/rAd26  S compared with the sequence  rAd26  S/AZD1222,  particularly 
with respect to the  incidence  of Grade 3  (severe)  solicited local and systemic AEs observed during  the 
first few days  after  injection.  Overall,  the  reactogenicity  findings  were consistent  with the  known  and 
well-established safety  profile  of  AZD1222. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
New information on  the  benefit of Vaxzevria support: 
The use  of  Vaxzevria as  heterologous  booster; 
A  rapid waning  of antibody  titres  and  vaccine  effectiveness,  but  persistence  of  effectiveness against 
severe forms; 
There are no new  data  on  efficacy  that  alters previous  assessments,  which  are  describe  in  the approved 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  109/123 
product  information. 
These  data  provide  supportive  evidence  of AZD1222's  immunogenicity  and  safety profile  when  used  as  a 
heterologous  booster.  Yet,  these  findings  should be further explored in  the  Omicron  era. 
4.  Benefit-risk balance 
4.1.  New information  on  the  benefit  of  Vaxzevria 
New  efficacy/effectiveness  data  indicate an  potential  role  of  Vaxzevria in heterologous  vaccination 
scheme.  Yet,  these  findings  should be further  confirmed  in  the  Omicron  era  and  with new variants of 
interest. 
Data also support effectiveness  against  severe  forms of  COVID-19 leading to hospitalisation  or death. 
New information  on  the  benefit  of  Vaxzevria  does  not modify the  conclusions  of  previous assessments. 
4.2.  New information  on  the risks  of  Vaxzevria 
Safety  items  for  which  a causal  relationship  is  considered  as a reasonable  possibility  and  which  are 
proposed  for  addition  in  section 4. 8  of the  Sm PC: 
o  Cutaneous  vasculitis 
Safety  items  for which new safety  information  does  not  support  a  causal  association  with Vaxzevria: 
o  Hearing  loss 
o  Sarcoidosis 
o  Subacute  thyroiditis 
o  Rhabdomyolysis 
o  Viral reactivation  (Non-Zoster) 
o  Myocarditis 
o  Exacerbation  of type 1/type 2  diabetes  mellitus,  adrenal  insufficiency  and  hypertension 
o  Corneal graft  rejection  (see  Section 1. 3. 7) 
Safety items for which  a causal  relationship  with Vaxzevria is uncertain and further  discussion  is 
required: 
o  Thrombosis,  and  more  particularly VTE 
o  ADEM 
o  Menstrual  disorders 
o  Glomerulonephritis and nephrotic  syndrome,  including  IgA  nephropathy 
Of note,  regulatory  actions were taken  regarding risks  already  identified  in  the  previous  PSUR: 
SmPC has  been updated  for tinnitus and  paraesthesia/hypoaesthesia,  (see section 1. 3. 1 and 1. 3. 2) 
RMP has  been updated  for anaphylaxis (which has  been  removed from  the  important  identified risks) 
Signals  and  safety  topics  identified after the  data  lock point: 
Pemphigus  and  pemphigoid,  identified  by  EMA  in  October 2022:  confirmation  of the signal is  ongoing 
SCAR:  signal identified by WHO-UMC 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  110/123 
Finally,  it  should  be  noted  that  no new risk or new level of risk was  identified after  a booster  dose with 
Vaxzevria  or  after  an  heterologous  boost  following  a primary  vaccination with Vaxzevria. 
The  PRAC  Rapporteur concludes  that  safety  findings  during  the  reporting period  did  not change 
significantly the  level of concern  regarding  the  safety of  Vaxzevria. 
4.3.  Conclusion  on  the benefit/risk  balance 
The  PRAC  Rapporteur considers  that  safety  information  collected  during  the  period  under  review  [from 
29.12. 2021  to 28. 06. 2022] does  not  modify the  B/R balance  of the  vaccine.  However,  the  risks  of SARS­
CoV-2  infection  and  the  context  of treatment  and  prevention  of the disease  have  evolved. 
TTS,  CVST and GBS,  the  key  risks  identified for  Vaxzevria,  are greater risks  in young adults who benefit 
less from vaccination.  This observation led to question  the  B/R balance in  the  younger population and  for 
several  EU  Member  States  to  restrict the  use  of the vaccine,  especially  after  more  alternative  vaccines 
were  made  available.  In the  EU  context,  the  use  of  vaccines  in  specific  groups  remains  to the  remit of the 
NITAGs  and  NIPS. 
Overall,  the benefit/risk  balance  for  Vaxzevria remains unchanged.

Issue  resolved 
RSI 02 - Venous  Thromboembolism 
To  address  the  inconsistent  risk  estimations  of venous  thromboembolism  observed  in  the 
literature studies,  the  MAH is  asked to  discuss the  interest of conducting  a meta-analysis  of  all 
available data  from the  MAH studies as  well as any  published studies in the next  PBRER. 
MAH's response 
Studies are generally eligible to  be  combined  in  a  meta-analysis  if they are  similar enough to  be  grouped 
together,  with respect to their study  designs,  research questions,  study  and  comparator  populations, 
settings  and  context,  interventions  or exposures,  data  collection  methods,  time points  of  collection, 
measurements,  and  the  consideration  of within-study biases and reporting  biases  (McKenzie  et al  2022). 
Out  of the  twelve  studies  included  in  the last  PBRER ( covering the  period 29  December  2021  to 28 June 
2022),  four are  cohort studies  using unvaccinated persons as a comparator,  three  are  cohort  studies 
using historical  comparators,  four  are  self-controlled case  series  which  includes  cases  only comparing  the 
time  period after  vaccination  to an  unexposed  baseline  period,  and one  was  a  systematic  review  and 
meta-analysis.  Given these  different  designs,  a  meta-analysis would be  problematic. 
One of the  included studies  in  the  last  PBRER (covering  the  period 29  December 2021  to 28 June 2022) 
was a systematic review with meta-analysis that  found  much heterogeneity  among  the  studies,  due  to 
different study populations being  included  such as transplant recipients  or cancer patients,  health care 
workers,  health care  workers  with previous  severe  allergic diseases,  and the general population (Chen  et 
al 2022).  As  included  in  the  last PBRER (covering the  period 29  December 2021  to 28 June 2022)  the 
AstraZeneca  assessment  of this study  is  that  the  adverse  event rates  of  venous and  arterial  thrombosis 
would differ  between  these  populations  and  to  meta-analyse  them makes  interpretation  difficult.  It is 
expected that  the  same  issues  would  be  encountered if  meta-analysing data  from  published  studies. 
Moreover,  the  outcome  measures differ  between  the studies,  with  some  including deep  vein  thrombosis 
(DVT)  and  pulmonary embolism  (PE)  (Burn  et al 2021,  Burn et al 2022;  Hippisley-Cox  et al 2021;  Whitely 
et al 2022). 
In one of AstraZeneca's  ongoing  PASS  studies,  the  multi-country  VAC4EU  PASS,  a  meta-analysis  of all 
adverse  events  of special interest  is  planned,  including  venous  thromboembolism.  The  meta-analysis  will 
combine  results  from  the  five databases  included  in  the  PASS:  CPRD  Aurum  (UK)  VID,  Catalonia ARS 
(Spain),  SIDIAP  (Spain),  Toscana  Valencia  (Italy),  and  PHARMO  (the  Netherlands)  and  the  total  sample 
will  exceed 5  million participants.  The  final report is expected in April 2024. 
In summary,  given  the  heterogeneity  of the published studies,  AstraZeneca  is  of the  opinion that 
conducting a meta-analysis of all  available  data would not add valuable  information  over the  routine 
ongoing literature  review,  that  will  be  submitted  as  part  of the  next  PBRER  ( data  lock  point: 28  December 
2022),  and  the  planned  meta-analysis  in  the  VAC4EU  PASS.

Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
The  MAH highlighted  the heterogeneity in  study design and methods of the  12 studies discussed in the 
last  PBRER.  It is  agreed that this will  make  it difficult to compare  the results of these studies and to 
combine  them  in  a  meaningful  way  in  a  meta-analysis.  Moreover,  the outcome measures differ between 
the studies,  with some including deep  vein  thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism  (PE).  VTE is also 
influenced by  multiple  factors  and  it  may be difficult to control for  all  of these factors in  a meta-analysis. 
As  part  of the  MAH's  PASS,  a  meta-analysis  of all AESI  is  planned,  including  venous  thromboembolism. 
The  meta-analysis  will combine  results  from  the  five European  databases  included  in  the  PASS  with a 
total sample  of over 5  million  participants.  The final  report is  expected in April 2024.  To note  is  that this 
meta-analysis may  face  similar challenges  (discussed in  procedure  EMEA/H/C/005675/MEA007. 7). 
The  MAH should  discuss the topic  of  VTE  by  providing an  updated  literature  review,  with a focus  on  new 
relevant  epidemiological studies  (cfr.  Section 4,  issues  to  be  addressed  in  the  next  PSUR). 
Issue  partially resolved data  to be further discussed in  the  next PSUR. 
7.  Comments  from  Member States 
Comments  from EMA 
On 8  December  2022,  EMA  sent out  a validated  signal for  myositis  [EPITT  19882],  based  on  the 
following: 
Background:  Idiopathic  inflammatory myopathies  (IIM),  also referred to as  (autoimmune)  myositis  or 
autoimmune myopathies,  are a  group  of autoimmune disorders  with a heterogenous  and  specific 
spectrum  of  muscular  and  extra-muscular  involvement.  IIM classifications  vary  but  the  main subtypes 
include dermatomyositis (DM),  polymyositis  (PM),  immune-mediated  necrotising  myopathy  (IMNM)  and 
inclusion  body  myositis  (IBM).  Forms  of  IIM  that share  features  with other  connective  tissue  diseases are 
referred to  as  overlap myositis (OM).  These  include antisynthetase  syndrome  (ASS).  IIMs  are  rare 
conditions  (DM/PM annual  incidence 0. 4-4  cases  per 100,000 patients)  more  common  in  women  and 
people  of  Black ethnicity.  The usual  onset age  of  PM  is  between 45-60  years while  DM shows  a  bimodal 
age  distribution  (5-15  and 45-60  years). 
Patients  with  IIM  typically  present  with  progressive  symmetric  proximal  weakness  that  may  manifest  as 
difficulty rising from chairs,  climbing stairs or combing  one's  hair.  Patients  with  DM  also show typical  skin 
lesions  (heliotrope  rash,  shawl  sign,  Gottron papules,  mechanic's  hands)  while  those with ASS  experience 
a  variable  combination  of myositis,  arthritis,  Raynaud  phenomenon,  mechanic's  hands and  interstitial lung 
disease  (ILD).  Diagnosis of  IIMs is  based  on  muscle  biopsy  (gold standard),  clinical signs,  serology 
(autoantibodies),  laboratory parameters  (e. g. ,  creatine  kinase),  electromyography  (EMG)  and/or 
magnetic resonance  imaging  (MRI).  Therapeutic  management  is based  on  immunomodulating  and 
immunosuppressive agents  [ . . .  ].  The 5-year survival rate  is around  75%,  with causes  of death linked to 
generalised weakness,  dysphagia/undernutrition,  respiratory failure  or  infections. 
IIMs  are associated with both genetic factors  (certain HLA subtypes) and  environmental triggers such as 
drugs,  infections,  UV light,  vitamin  D deficiency,  smoking and  cancer.  SARS-CoV-2  infection has  been 
linked to a viral  myositis  attributable  to direct  myocyte  invasion or  induction  of autoimmunity.  COVID-19-
induced  myositis  may vary  in  presentation,  from typical  dermatomyositis  to rhabdomyolysis,  and  a 
paraspinal  affliction  with  back  pain.  The  pathophysiology  of  IIM is complex with various pathways:  DM  is 
a complement-mediated  microangiopathy  leading to  destruction  of capillaries,  distal hypoperfusion and 
inflammatory cell stress  on  the  perifascicular regions,  while  PM  is  characterised by cytotoxic CDS-positive 
T cells which clonally  expand  in  situ and  invade muscle fibres expressing the  major histocompatibility

AstraZeneca--• AstraZeneca-
complex (MHC)-1.  An autoimmune  response  to nuclear  and cytoplasmic  autoantigens  is  detected  in 60  -
80%  of  patients  with  PM/DM.  The  autoantibodies  involved  in  IIM are divided into  myositis-specific 
autoantibodies  (MSA),  which are found primarily  in  patients  with IIM,  and  myositis-associated 
autoantibodies  (MAA),  which are shared  with other connective  tissue  diseases.  [ . . .  ].  These  antibodies  are 
important  markers  of  diagnosis and  prognosis,  and  guide  therapeutic  management  of  IIM.  [ . . .  ] 
Seriousness:  Idiopathic  inflammatory  myopathies  (IIM) carry  a significant  morbidity.  Seventy-five  percent 
(75%) of cases  in  EudraVigilance  (EV)  are  reported  as  serious,  including 5  fatal  cases. 
Evidence:  21  literature cases  from 11 articles,  209  cases  in  EV  (including 12  of the 21  literature cases). 
Significant  imbalance  in  observed-to-expected  (O/E) analyses.

Regulatory Context:  Some  myositis-related terms  included  in  search strategies  for  other  safety  topics  in 
PSURs  (i. e. ,  VAED/VAERD  and  rhabdomyolysis),  but  no  dedicated discussion  on  myositis.  Signal sent in 
parallel for  Comirnaty  and Spikevax. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
EMA identified a signal  on  myositis  after vaccination with Vaxzevria  based  on EudraVigilance (EV)  and 
literature  data  [EPITT  19882]. 
At the  time  of the signal  validation,  a total  of 209  cases  were  retrieved  from  EV  and  described  mainly 
Myositis  (150),  Dermatomyositis  [DM] (28),  and  Polymyositis  [PM] (21).  The  majority  of the  cases  were 
reported from non-HCPs.  Cases  reports  were mainly  described  in  female  (ratio  female-to-male  of 1. 8 :  1) 
which might reflect the natural  epidemiology  of the disease.  A prior history  of  myositis was reported  in 11 
cases.  About 75%  of cases were  serious,  including 5 cases with a fatal outcome.  The range of TTO was 
quite  large,  from  O  to 274  days,  with a  median  of 6  days. 
No  signal  of  disproportionate  reporting  was  found  for  any  of the  reported  PT.  ROR(-)  for  most  frequently 
reported PTs was  as  followed:  myositis  [n= 152;  ROR(-)  0.44] ,  dermatomyositis  [n= 28;  ROR(-)  0. 25], 
and polymyositis  [n= 23;  ROR(-)  0. 26]. 
Twenty-one  (21) cases  were  identified from  11  articles  in  the literature.  The  diagnosis  was 9  cases  of 
autoimmune myositis,  5  cases  of  myositis,  3  cases of  DM,  and 1  case  of  each  inflammatory myositis, 
amyopathic  DM,  PM,  and anti-Jo-1 syndrome.  Myositis-specific autoantibodies  [MSAJ  were  identified in  7 
cases  and  myositis-associated  autoantibodies  [MM]  in 8  cases.  Most patients  improved and  recovered 
with treatment  and 1  case  had  a fatal outcome. 
An  O/E analysis was  performed using  UK and  ES  background rates,  with stratification by  gender,  age and 
risk periods.  A significant imbalance was  observed when UK rates  were used but  not  with  ES  rates  (e.g. 
O/E ratio  (7 days risk period) =  2.82 [95%CI 2. 21  - 3. 55] with UK rate and 0. 89  [95%CI 0. 7  - 1. 12]  for 
ES  rates).  When  stratified by  gender and  age,  an  imbalance  was  observed  for younger females  (i. e.  20-
29yo and 30-39yo)  with both  UK and  ES  rates. 
Available  safety  information  supports  the  need for  further  review of occurrence  of  myositis  following 
vaccination  with Vaxzevria. 
It is  therefore  recommended that  the  MAH submits  in the next  PSUR (O LP 28  December 2022): 
•  a cumulative  review of cases  of  myositis  in  association  with Vaxzevria including  spontaneous  reports 
and data  from the  literature and clinical trials.  The  search strategy  should  be  conducted  at  the  level of 
HLT 'Muscle  infections and inflammations'; 
•  a causality  assessment of the cases; 
•  an  observed  vs  expected  (O/E)  analysis  for  all cases  identified  in  EU  and  UK of myositis and  related 
conditions  with  a risk window of O  to 28  days  and  also  including  events  with unknown TTO.  For the 
calculations  of the O/E analysis,  the  relevant  and  justifiable  background  incidence  rate(s)  should  be 
used as  well as  exposure  in  EU/UK; 
•  a  discussion  on  the  plausibility and biological  mechanism(s)  for a  possible  causal  association  between 
myositis  and  related  conditions  and  vaccination with Vaxzevria; 
•  a  discussion  on  the  need for updating  product  information  and/or risk management  plan,  and submit 
proposal  as required. 
The  MAH should  ensure  that  all  identified literature cases  have  been  submitted to EudraVigilance and 
efforts should  be  made  to follow up  on  other spontaneous  cases  which  are  currently  subject  to limited

[ Request for the  next  PBRER] 
Comments from  MSl 
We overall  agree with Rapporteur's assessment,  but would like to highlight some issues: 
•  ADEM:  is  cumulatively reviewed in this PSUR. This review showed 3 cases classified by the MAH as 
BCC level 1  (one  of them confirmed  by  ante-mortem biopsy and autopsy) and the others with absence 
of recurrence/relapse  of illness up to  3  months.  In addition,  the  Rapporteur  identified at  least 6  cases 
from the  literature  with  a  possible causal  association  with Vaxzevria,  and  one  of them would  be  a  BCC 
level  1  case.  Although the  O/E analysis  using  BCC level 1-3 cases  did  not yield a ratio significantly 
greater than  1  for  any  of the  risk windows or the different stratifications (age/gender/region),  the 
Rapporteur  notes  a  disproportional  reporting  of ADEM with  Vaxzevria  in  EVDAS.  The  Rapporteur finally 
considers  that  a potential  signal  of ADEM after  Vaxzevria  exists  and a new cumulative  review of this 
issue  is  requested for the next  PSUR.  We acknowledged  that  the diagnosis  of ADEM  is  challenging, 
especially  regarding  spontaneous cases  usually  lacking relevant data.  For  example,  in  the  Spanish 
reporting  database 4 cases  were reported up  to 28  November of 2021  and 3  of them were classified  as 
BCC  2  cases  by  our  expert  panel.  These  cases  could  not  be  classified  as  BCC 1  level since  data  from 
biopsy  or  follow-up  at  three months  were  lacking,  but a causal  relationship  with the  vaccine could not 
be ruled  out.  ADEM  is an  important  potential  risk in  the  RMP,  but  not mentioned in  the  product 
information.  Although we concur with the  Rapporteur  to  request  a new  cumulative  review  of this  topic, 
in  our  view,  ADEM  should be  mentioned  in  section 4.4 with the  other  neurological  events,  so  that 
physicians  are warned  to  rule  out  other causes  as stated  section  4.4 for  other  neurological  events. 
We agree  that  more  robust  epidemiological  data  are  missing to further evaluate  this  association,  but 
we are  not  sure  that  the  studies  included  in  the  RMP and performed by  the  MAH could  provide  more 
information.  However,  some  other  studies  promoted  by EMA  (eg.  ROC 20)  may  provide  further  data. 
•  Menstrual  disorders:  we  endorse  the  Rapporteur evaluation about  this  issue  and  no  changes  in  the 
product information are  needed at  this stage.  The Rapporteur proposes that  cases  of  menstrual 
disorders  do  not need to be  further  discussed  through  PBRERs  unless  significant new safety 
information  is  identified.  However,  we consider that  serious cases  requiring hospitalization  and  the  two 
cases  resulted  in  death should be further  described.  Nonetheless,  we  also  concur with the  Rapporteur 
that more relevant  information  is expected to be provided from the  updated review of the  literature. 
•  Hearing loss:  although there are cases that resolved within 7 days,  this  only applies to 90  cases/340 
cases  that  recovered  and  reported  time for  recovering.  There  are  still 975  cases  where  the  patient  did 
not  recover  and  70  patients  that  recovered  with  sequelae.  Although we  agree  that  no changes  in  the 
product  information  are  warranted,  the  MAH should  keep  monitoring  this  issue  in  the next  PSUR, 
focusing  on  the  cases  that  recovered  with  sequelae  and  those  that  did not  recover. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
ADEM 
The comment from the  MSl is  acknowledged. 
However,  as  per the  SmPC guidance: 
• 
any  adverse  reactions described  in  section 4. 4  or known  to result from conditions  mentioned  in 
section 4.4  should  also  be  included  in  section 4. 8 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  116/123 
• 
adverse  events  without  at  least  a suspected causal relationship should not  be  listed in  the  SmPC. 
Based  on  the guidance,  and considering that  possible causal relationship between ADEM and  the 
vaccine  has  not been  established  yet,  the  PRAC  Rapporteur  considers  that  ADEM  should  not be listed  in 
the SmPC section 4. 4 at  this stage.  This  topic will  be further discussed  in  the  next  PSUR. 
As further clarified  by  EMA  (email  of 21  Dec 2022),  EMA-funded  studies  (i. e.  ACCESS  and  ECVM)  have 
provided  the  following  information: 
1) In ACCESS  (see Table 3  of the  article  published  in  the journal  Vaccine  ),  it has  been found  that  there 
is  a  very  low  background  incidence  rate  of ADEM  in  the  general  population,  ranging from  0. 05  (0. 00-
0. 14)  per 100,000 person-years  of observations  in  databases covering only general practitioners,  0. 08 
(0. 00-0. 38)  in  inpatient and  EMR hospital databases and 0.33 (0. 06-0. 59)  in GP &  in-outpatient 
databases. 
2) There were  no cases  of  ADEM  reported  in  the  prospective  ECVM  study based  on patients' reporting 
through an  App,  but  the design of this  study  mainly allowed to  collect  data  on  signs and symptoms,  not 
on  medical diagnoses. 
3)  A  study  on  the  incidence  of AESis  in  four  electronic health care  records  was  performed in WP2  of the 
ECVM  study.  Table 4  (page 28)  shows  that  for  ADEM  the  pooled  age-standardised  background 
incidence  rate  in 2020  was  1. 05  (0.92-1. 18).  For  Vaxzevria,  there  was  no  statistically  significant 
differences between the age-standardised  incidence  rates  before  and  after vaccination  with dose 1  or 
dose 2. 
The association between  Vaxzevria and ADEM would be difficult to investigate  in epidemiological 
studies considering the  low incidence rates  of the  disease  and  its  insidious  onset  will render SCCS quite 
challenging. 
However,  as  previously requested,  the  MAH should  provide  an  updated  literature  review,  with a focus 
on  new relevant epidemiological studies.

Comments from  MS4 
We would  like to highlight to the Rapporteur a case 
of new  daily  persistent 
headache  (NDPH)  reported from a  member of the public  to the  NCA.  The  case  concerns  a 61-year-old 
female who  on  same  day  as  the  first dose  of  Vaxzevria  experienced  blindness  transient  (lost  vision  twice/ 
seeing shapes),  contusion  (bruising),  headaches (severe headaches),  head  discomfort  (feeling pressure  in 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  117/123 
head),  and  discomfort  (feeling pressure  in  neck).  No detail  on  other relevant  medical history  was  reported 
and the  patient reported no  concomitant  medication.  This  case  was  initially received  in June 2021  and 
eight  follow-ups  to the  case  have  been  reported  by  the  patient  since.  The  follow-ups  describe  that  the 
severe  headache  pain  has  continued  since  receiving  the  first  dose  of  Vaxzevria  and  the  patient can no 
longer work  or tolerate exercise.  Results for  blood  tests,  CT and  MRI scans have  been normal and  in 
January 2022  the  patient  was  diagnosed by  her neurologist with refractory  new  daily persistent headache, 
following failure  of several treatment  options.  At the  time  of the  most  recent follow-up the  patient  had  not 
recovered. 
In addition  to  this  case  report  we conducted  an  initial search of  EVDAS  and  have  identified 43  cases 
reporting  the  PT 'new daily  persistent headache'  and  the  ROR (-)  =  5. 29. 
Whilst acknowledging the  limitations  in  the  evidence  base and the challenges  in  establishing a causal 
association  considering  the  severity  and  impact  on  quality  of life  reported  in 
and  the 
signal  of  disproportionality  in  EVDAS we  would  ask the  Rapporteur to consider including  a request  for  a 
cumulative  review of all  data sources  for this  topic for the next  PSUR. 
Rapporteur  assessment  comment: 
The comment  is  acknowledged  and agreed.  Considering the  severity  of the  event and the 
disproportionality  in  EV,  a cumulative review of  post-marketing,  clinical and literature data has  been 
requested to  the  MAH. 
The  LoQ  for the next  PSUR has  been updated  accordingly.

Quality  Comments 
Quality Issue  1 :  percentages  exposure 
The MAH is  reminded of the  request from  the previous Assessment Report  to provide 
percentages for the  exposure information in line  with  the bi-monthly SSR#7 (Aug-Sept 2021) 
to facilitate  the review and quick  evaluation by the assessors. 
AstraZeneca response:  Please  refer to Section 5.2. 1 where  the  percentages  for the  VAXZEVRIA exposure 
based  on doses  distributed  are provided  in Table 6,  Table  7,  Table 8,  and Table 9. 
PRAC  Rapporteur comment:  data  were provided as requested  (see  Section 1. 3. 3. 2  of the  AR).  Issue 
resolved 
PRAC  PSUR  assessment  report 
EMA/PRAC/1098/2023 
Page  122/123 
Quality Issue 2: causality scale 
The MAH is  reminded  that  the  WHO-UMC  causality  scale  should be used for every causality 
evaluation  (see  eg,  topic: Sarcoidosis  - Section 2.3.36)  and  to  make  efforts  to correct 
discrepancies  (see  eg,  discrepancy Hearing loss Events - Section 2.3.28). 
AstraZeneca response:  For the  vast  majority  of topics,  including sarcoidosis  and  hearing  loss,  the WHO­
UMC causality assessment  algorithm  has  been applied as  requested.  Given that  the definition  of a 
plausible  risk window is central to the algorithm,  topics  for which a  plausible  risk window cannot  be 
defined  (such  as menstrual  disorders)  are not suitable  for this  approach.  In  addition,  for the  topic  of 
"Thrombosis  with Thrombocytopenic  Syndrome",  a specific case  definition  that  incorporates  probability  of 
causality,  as  proposed by the  Medicines  and Healthcare  products  Regulatory  Agency  (MHRA),  has  been 
applied  to judge  individual  case  assessments  based  on  the  criteria  as  presented  in  Section 15. 2. 15, 
response to Question 1  d). 
AstraZeneca apologizes for the discrepancies identified by  PRAC  in 2nd  PBRER on hearing loss and has 
made efforts to  prevent such discrepancies. 
PRAC  Rapporteur comment:  the  MAH clarified that for the  vast  majority  of topics,  including 
Sarcoidosis,  the WHO-UMC  causality scale  has  been  applied.  It  is  agreed  that  for the topic  of "Thrombosis 
with Thrombocytopenic  Syndrome",  specific case  definitions  apply.  Regarding discrepancies  such as  noted 
for  Hearing loss,  the  MAH  made  efforts  to prevent  these.  Issue  resolved.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
AstraZeneca 
25 August 2022 
• 
Introduction: This Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER) for 
V AXZEVRIA TM (AZD 1222) summarises safety and efficacy/effectiveness data received 
and evaluated by AstraZeneca from 29 December 202 1 to 28 June 2022, and places it in 
the context of the cumulative data and the overall benefit-risk profile. 
•  Medicinal product: V AXZEVRIA is a monovalent vaccine composed of a single 
recombinant, replication-deficient chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAdOxl )  vector encoding 
the S glycoprotein of the Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). 
Following administration, the S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is expressed locally 
stimulating neutralizing antibody and cellular immune responses. V AXZEVRIA is 
indicated for active immunization of individuals � 1 8  years old for the prevention of 
coronavirus disease 201 9  (COVID-19). V AXZEVRIA is supplied as a vial containing 
either 8 doses or 10 doses per vial, 0.5 mL per dose for intramuscular (IM) injection. The 
V AXZEVRIA primary vaccination course consists of two separate doses of 0.5 ml each. 
The second dose should be administered between 4 and 12 weeks after the first dose. It is 
recommended that individuals who receive a first dose of V AXZEVRIA complete the 
vaccination course with V AXZEVRIA. A booster dose (third dose) of 0.5 ml may be 
given to individuals who completed the primary vaccination course with V AXZEVRIA 
or another authorised COVID-1 9  vaccine at least 3-months after completing the primary 
vaccination course. The approval and dosing interval of booster dose for V AXZEVRIA 
may vary according to the countries of authorisation. 
•  Marketing approvals: As of 28 June 2022, V AXZEVRIA has been approved for 
conditional marketing authorisation or emergency use authorisation in 93 countries 
managed by AstraZeneca and its partners - Serum Institute of lndia (SIi), R-pharm, 
Fiocruz, and Verity Pharmaceuticals. V AXZEVRIA is distributed via COVID-1 9  
Vaccines Global Access programme (COV AX), in collaboration with United Nations 
Children's Fund (UNICEF) and Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), under a 
World Health Organization (WHO) Emergency Use Listing to more than 80 countries. 
•  Actions taken or proposed for safety reasons: 
• 
No significant actions related to safety were taken or proposed during the reporting 
period 
Safety changes to Reference Safety Information: 
During this reporting period, the V AXZEVRIA (Core Data Sheet) CDS was updated to 
include the following safety-related changes: 
On 06 January 2022 CDS Section 4.6 - Pregnancy and lactation was updated with 
pregnancy wording to reflect current safety data on administration ofV AXZEVRIA in 
pregnant women. Also, recommendation to consider use of V AXZEVRIA during 
pregnancy when benefits outweigh potential risks was updated. 
On 16 January 2022 CDS Section 4.6 - Pregnancy and lactation was updated with 
wording to reflect current non-clinical, clinical and post-marketing data on use of 
V AXZEVRIA during breastfeeding. 
On 04 February 2022 CDS Section 4.2 - Posology and method of administration was 
updated to include the recommendation for use of a booster dose ( third dose) in 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY

individuals who completed the primary vaccination course with V AXZEVRIA or another 
authorised COVID-1 9  vaccine. Timing for administration of the booster dose is at least 3 
months after completing the primary vaccination course. The text in CDS Section 4.4 -
Special warnings and special precautions for use was revised to clarify that limited data 
are available regarding the interchangeability of V AXZEVRIA with other COVID-1 9  
vaccines. 
On 02 March 2022 CDS Section 4.8 Undesirable effects was updated to add paraesthesia 
and hypoaesthesia to the summary of post-authorisation data, with frequency uncommon. 
On 1 1  May 2022 CDS Section 4.4 - Special warnings and special precautions for use 
was updated to include the warning on Neurological events to specifically reference very 
rare events of Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS) as having been reported following 
vaccination with V AXZEVRIA. 
•  Estimated cumulative exposure of clinical trial subjects: Approximately 
601 53 patients and/or healthy volunteers have been enrolled into the clinical 
development programme, of which approximately 35921 have received V AXZEVRIA 
and 1 523 have received AZD28 1 6. 
•  Estimated cumulative and reporting period patient exposure from post-approval 
(marketing) experience: AstraZeneca is working directly with health departments in 
individual countries to determine the number of doses administered. Presently, 
administration data is available from the European Union, United Kingdom, Afghanistan, 
Argentina, Australia, Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, 
India, Iran, Iraq, Japan, Lebanon, Malaysia, Mexico, Nepal, New Zealand, Peru, 
Philippines, Saint Lucia, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Uruguay. The cumulative 
number of doses administered in these territories/regions was confirmed as being over 
2.09 billion doses. The number of doses distributed globally are over 2.79 billion doses 
cumulatively. 
•  Late-breaking information: On 01 July 2022, CDS Section 4.8 was updated to include 
'Tinnitus' with frequency 'Uncommon'. 
The following signals were validated after the data-lock of this PBRER: 
Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP): The signal for ITP was re-opened based on well­
documented case reports of ITP with V AXZEVRIA from the published literature. 
Cutaneous Vasculitis: The signal for cutaneous vasculitis was identified based on well­
documented case series from published literature cases. Subsequently a signal was 
received from PRAC (Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee) PSUR (Periodic 
Safety Update Report) assessment report. Upon further evaluation the signal is confirmed 
and the CDS Section 4.8 is in progress to be updated to include cutaneous vasculitis as an 
ADR (frequency: not known). The updated CDS will be internally approved before the 
due date of this PBRER. 
• 
Summary of overall benefit-risk evaluation: 
The clinical benefit demonstrated in clinical trials, combined with the overall safety 
profile ofV AXZEVRIA has established a positive benefit-risk profile for the approved 
indications. 
The data received during the reporting period do not indicate a change in this positive 
benefit-risk profile for the approved indications.

(R2) PBRER guideline and EU Good Pharmacovigilance Practices Module VII (Revision 1 ); 
the terms/terminology used in this report are consistent with this guidance, and applicable 
international regulatory requirements. 
The V AXZEVRIA International Birth Date (IBD) is 29 December 2020. 
V AXZEVRIA is a monovalent vaccine composed of a single recombinant, replication­
deficient chimpanzee adenovirus (ChAdOxl )  vector encoding the S glycoprotein of the 
Severe Acute Respiratory Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Following administration, the S 
glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 is expressed locally stimulating neutralizing antibody and 
cellular immune responses. 
V AXZEVRIA is indicated for active immunisation of individuals � 1 8  years for the 
prevention of Coronavirus Disease 201 9  (COVID-19). 
V AXZEVRIA is supplied as a vial containing either 8 doses or 10 doses per vial, 0.5 mL per 
dose for intramuscular (IM) injection. V AXZEVRIA vaccination course consists of two 
separate doses of 0.5 ml each. The second dose should be administered between 4 and 12 
weeks after the first dose. It is recommended that individuals who receive a first dose of 
V AXZEVRIA complete the primary vaccination course with V AXZEVRIA. The CDS 
indicates that a booster dose (third dose) of 0.5 ml may be given to individuals who 
completed the primary vaccination course with V AXZEVRIA or another authorised 
COVID-1 9  vaccine. The third dose should be administered at least 3 months after completing 
the primary vaccination course. The status of approval and the recommendation in national 
prescribing information (PI) documents relating to the booster dose vary. 
The inclusion of any information relating to a validated signal, important potential risk, or 
missing information within this PBRER should not be taken to imply that a causal association 
with the use of V AXZEVRIA has been established.

Cumulative and interval patient exposure from marketing 
experience 
Post-approval (non-clinical trials) exposure 
5.2.1 
The post-marketing patient exposure data in this report is presented by number of doses 
distributed and doses administered. All exposure is intended for the same indication and route 
of administration. 
For doses distributed, this information has been provided below in section 5.2. 1 . 1  and it 
includes dose distribution information across all markets, those where AstraZeneca is the 
Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) and those supported by the licence partners (SIi, 
R-Pharm, Fiocruz, and Verity Pharmaceuticals). 
For doses administered to vaccinees, this is a more accurate measure ofvaccinee exposure 
and provides more detailed vaccinee-level data ( eg, gender and age category). Therefore, 
AstraZeneca is continuing to work on the collection of this information at the country level, 
from relevant health departments, for all countries administering the V AXZEVRIA. 
However, at the time of this report, AstraZeneca has received exposure data based on doses 
administered to vaccinees in specific countries/regions only; additional information can be 
found in section 5.2. 1 .2 below.

The weekly administered data is subject to change every week. The administered data for the PBRER reporting 
interval is derived by subtracting the previous report's cumulative from current cumulative values (Current 
Cumulative - Previous Cumulative = Current Interval) across all the Countries. Therefore, the negative values 
here is due to a greater cumulative value from previous report in comparison to current report.

Lack of efficacy from Post-Marketing 
Interval Period (29 December 2021 - 28 June 2022) 
A search of the AstraZeneca Global Safety database for the reporting interval using the Lack 
of Efficacy standardised MedDRA query (SMQ), retrieved 16964 reports with the following 
1 6973 AEs (PTs): Vaccination failure (16620), Drug ineffective (23 1), Therapy partial 
responder (72), Therapeutic product effect decreased (1 5), Therapeutic response decreased 
( 6), Therapeutic product ineffective ( 6), Therapeutic response shortened ( 5), Therapeutic 
product effect incomplete (5), Drug tolerance (4), Drug effect less than expected (2), Disease 
progression (2), Treatment failure (1), Therapeutic product effect delayed (1), Drug level 
abnormal (1), Drug level decreased (1), and Drug resistance (1). 
Of the  16964 reports, 16700 (98.4%) were medically confirmed (MC) and the remaining 264 
(1 .6%) were consumer reports. A total of 16632 (98.0%) reports were considered serious due 
to the AE being considered medically important (16367), required hospitalization (161), was 
life threatening (LT) (23), and/or resulted in death (8 1). Cases may have met more than one 
criteria for seriousness. The remaining 332 (2.0%) reports were non-serious (NS). Of the 
1 6964 reports, 95.0% (16120) were reported from Austria. 
There were 8 1  fatal cases in the reporting interval. Age was reported in 79 (97.5%) of these 
81 cases with a median age of 75 years old; range 52 to 92 years. A total of 23 cases occurred 
in females, 55 in males, and 3 of unknown gender. Cause of death PTs included: Vaccination

enhanced respiratory disease (1 ), Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (1 ), and 
Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (1 ). Most fatal cases contained confounders, such as 
advanced age, hypertension, diabetes, asthma, alcoholism, obesity, COPD, cancer, stroke, 
heart failure/disease, dyslipidaemia, pulmonary embolism (PE), and myocardial infarction. 
Of the 16883 non-fatal cases, the outcomes were as follows: Not recovered (146), Recovered 
(192), Recovered with sequelae (5), Recovering (140), and Unknown (16400). 
Information on COVID-1 9  testing was available in 1 6464 reports; of these 16399 (99.61 %) 
were reported as COVID-1 9  test positive, 63 (0.38%) were reported as COVID-1 9  test 
negative and 2 (0.01 %) were reported as unknown. Further information on the 16399 reports 
(including 93 with first dose, 16279 with second dose, 5 with booster dose, and 22 with 
unknown dose) with a positive COVID-1 9  test is presented below: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
In 93 (0.6%) of the 16399 reports, COVID-1 9  test was positive after the receipt of the 
first dose of the vaccine; time to positive COVID-1 9  test was available for 66 (0.4%) 
cases and ranged from the same day as vaccination to 452 days with a median of 1 79 
days. In 1 report, the date of the positive test result was before the first dose 
vaccination date. In 26 (0.2%) reports, time to positive Covid-1 9  test after first dose of 
vaccine was unknown. 
In 16279 (99.3%) reports, COVID-1 9  test was positive after the receipt of the second 
dose of the vaccine; time to positive COVID-1 9  test was available for 16259 (99.1 %) 
cases and ranged from 7 days to 373 days with a median of 142 days. Time to positive 
COVID-1 9  test was O to  14 days in 2 cases and 15 to 373 days in 16257 cases. In 20 
(0. 1  %) reports, time to positive COVID-1 9  test after second dose of vaccine was 
unknown. 
In 5 (0.03%) reports, COVID-1 9  test was positive after the receipt of the booster dose 
of the vaccine; time to positive COVID-1 9  test was available all 5 cases: 2, 19, 2 1 ,  
1 02, and 105 days. 
In 22 (0. 13%) reports, COVID-1 9  test was positive after the receipt of unknown dose 
of the vaccine; time to positive COVID-1 9  test was available for 12 (0.07%) cases and 
ranged from 77 days to 255 days with a median of 144 days. In 10 (0.06%) reports, 
time to positive Covid-1 9  test after unknown dose of vaccine was unknown. 
Cumulative Review (29 December 2020 - 28 June 2022)

Of the 22705 reports, 2 1 639 (95.3%) were medically confirmed and the remaining 1066 
(4.7%) were consumer reports. A total of 2 1 379 (94.2%) reports were considered serious due 
to the AE being considered medially important (20636), the AE resulted in a congenital 
anomaly (1 ), the AE was reported to have resulted in disability (1 8), required hospitalization 
(491), was life threatening (8 1), and/or resulted in death (152). Cases may have met more 
than one criteria for seriousness. The remaining 1 326 (5.8%) reports were non-serious. Of the 
22705 reports, 87.5% (19856) were reported from Austria. Cumulatively, there have been 152 
fatal cases. 
Of the 22553 non-fatal cases, the outcomes were as follows: 
Not recovered (559) Recovered (784), Recovered with sequelae (9), Recovering (461), and 
Unknown (20740). 
Conclusion 
Review of all the lack of efficacy reports did not demonstrate any specific trend or safety 
information associated with use of V AXZEVRIA. The imbalance of reporting rates during 
the reporting period and cumulatively is noted. Of note, 95.0% of the reports (16120/16964) 
during the reporting interval and 87.5% (19856/22705) of the reports cumulatively were from 
Austria. This is due to a local reporting system where cases from the epidemiological 
reporting system for COVID-1 9  are linked with the vaccination passport and submitted to 
Eudravigilance/ AstraZeneca in bulk.

gender where administration data was available. References for background estimates 
obtained from the literature are provided in Appendix 9. The 0/E analysis of fatal reports 
showed that observed cases occurred significantly less frequently than expected for all ages 
and by different age stratifications from European Economic Area (EEA)+UK +Brazil+ and 
Australia. Results of the 0/E analyses are presented in Table 14, Table  1 5  and Table  1 6. 
Conservatively, the exposure for global reports (448306152) is based on doses administered 
in 1 3  regions/markets as explained in Appendix 8.

From the review of data available during the reporting period for all fatal case reports 
(including sudden death) and also taking into account the cumulative experience along with 
the O/E analysis of fatal cases there is no new safety information identified on this topic in 
association with V AXZEVRIA.

SUMMARIES OF SIGNIFICANT FINDINGS FROM 
CLINICAL TRIALS DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD 
Completed clinical trials 
7.1 
During the reporting period, one study investigating the safety and the immunogenicity of 
V AXZEVRIA was completed (study D8 1 1 1C00002). A summary of findings is described 
below: 
D8111C00002 (A Phase 1/11 Randomised, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled Multicentre 
Study in Participants Aged 18 Years or Older to Determine the Safety and 
lmmunogenicity of V AXZEVRIA, a Non-replicating ChAdOxl Vector Vaccine, for the 
Prevention of COVID-19): Phase I/II. 
This study assessed the safety and immunogenicity of V AXZEVRIA in Japan. The 
population recruited included 256 healthy volunteers with a significant portion of elderly 
randomized 3 :  1 to receive V AXZEVRIA or saline placebo with 4 weeks dosing interval. 
Primary read-out 4 weeks after the second dose (Day 57) including reactogenicity, safety and 
immunogenicity were reported in previous PBRER. 
During the reporting period for the current PBRER, we obtained results from primary data of 
the full year final read-out including safety and immunogenicity over time. This is the first 
long term evaluation of duration of humoral response to AZD 1222 in a homogenous 
population where all participants received the same regimen (two vaccinations 4 weeks apart) 
with placebo AZD1222 administered in 2 IM injections was generally well-tolerated and had 
an acceptable safety profile in Japanese adult participants across all age groups (18 to 
55 years, 56 to 69 years, and � 70 years), and the number of SAEs reported between Day 58 
and Day 365, in addition to the unsolicited AEs collected up to Day 57, was low. 
In the AZD1222 group, antibody titers for the S and Receptor-Binding Domain (RBD) 
antigens and for the nAb (pseudoneutralization) to SARS-CoV-2 increased substantially after 
the first dose of study intervention, increasing further after the second dose. Data show a 
slightly decreasing trend in titers with increasing age, although a large variability was 
observed in the individual titers, with overlap in confidence intervals (CI) between cohorts. 
Mean antibody titers had dropped by Day 1 83, decreasing further by Day 365, due to the 
expected waning ofhumoral immunogenicity. By Day 365, mean titers of S- and RBD­
binding antibodies remained above Baseline and Day 1 5  levels; however, a large proportion 
of participants had no measurable nAb (pseudoneutralization) at this time point.

Taking the above into account, these data suggest that AZD1222 elicits strong early immune 
responses against SARS-CoV-2 in the Japanese adult population across all the age groups; 
however, waning of immune responses, with neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) below the lower 
limit of quantification, was observed in a large proportion of participants by Day 365.

Efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity results from pooled analyses including data from 
COV00J,  COV002,  COV003 and COV005 studies: 
The evaluation of the efficacy, immunogenicity and safety ofV AXZEVRIA for prevention of 
COVID-1 9  is based on the pooled data from 4 ongoing clinical studies COV00l  (UK), 
COV002 (UK), COV003 (Brazil), and COV005 (South Africa). The primary efficacy 
analysis demonstrated effective protection of V AXZEVRIA against COVID-1 9  with a VE of 
66.73% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 57.41%, 74.01%) (p< 0.001) from 15 days after the 
second dose in seronegative participants receiving two standard doses (SDSD) or 1 low dose 
and 1 standard dose (LDSD). The pooled analyses demonstrated that V AXZEVRIA provides 
complete protection against COVID-1 9  hospital admission � 22 days after the first SD dose 
in the seronegative analysis set. For the SDSD regimen, it was demonstrated that vaccine 
protection begins from 22 days after the first dose and extends at least until 12 weeks, 
allowing the second dose to be given in a flexible window between 4 to 12 weeks. 
V AXZEVRIA elicited a strong induction of humoral immunogenicity, as measured by 
different serological assays following the first dose and the second dose ofV AXZEVRIA 
regardless the presence of co-morbid conditions at baseline, country, and age at screening. In 
summary, pooled analyses of the 4 ongoing University of Oxford-sponsored studies 
demonstrated a low incidence of SAEs in both the AZD1222 and control groups, with no 
difference in either frequency or type between the treatment groups The vaccine was well 
tolerated in pooled safety analyses. There was not a significant change in the safety profile 
during the reporting period.

COV006 (A single-blind, randomised, phase II study to determine safety and 
immunogenicity of the Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) vaccine ChAdOxl in UK 
healthy children and adolescents  [aged 6-17]): Phase II 
COV006 is an Oxford-sponsored, Phase II, single-blinded, active-controlled, randomised 
study in approximately 300 healthy children and adolescents aged 6-1 7  years in the UK, of 
2 doses 4 or 12 weeks apart of ChAdOx 1 nCo V-1 9  (V AXZEVRIA ) or active control 
(licensed Meningococcal B vaccine) administered IM. The study will assess safety, 
tolerability and immunogenicity of a SD dose (~5x1 010 vp) ofChAdOxl nCoV-19. The total 
duration of the study will be  12 months from the day of enrolment for all participants. 
Summary of results on the safety and immunogenicity of V AXZEVRIA  in children and 
adolescents. 
The primary objective of this study was to determine the tolerability of the V AXZEVRIA in 
children aged 6---1 7 years, in a two-dose regimen with either a 28-day or 84-day dosing 
interval. A total of 262 participants aged 6---17 years were enrolled into the study and assigned 
to vaccination with either V AXZEVRIA or capsular group B meningococcal vaccine at a 28-
day or 84-day interval. 
The study demonstrated that participants who were seropositive at baseline had stronger 
immunogenic responses 28 days after first dose than at 28 days after the second dose of the 
V AXZEVRIA in the seronegative participants, suggesting that, in this population, a single 
dose ofV AXZEVRIA may be able to offer protection against SARS-COV-2 in previously 
infected individuals. The authors also found that immune response in younger age groups (6-
1 1  years old) was stronger when compared to older age groups (12-1 7 years) after both a first 
and second dose of vaccine with a 1 12-day interval. 
Overall, V AXZEVRIA was well tolerated. As expected, fatigue and headache were the most 
commonly reported systemic solicited adverse events. The most common local solicited 
adverse events were pain and tenderness for all the ASTRAZENECA COVID-1 9  and 
capsular group B meningococcal groups following both doses. The proportion of participants 
reporting moderate to severe local reaction up to 7 days after vaccination was higher in those 
receiving the meningococcal vaccine than in those receiving the ASTRAZENACA COVID-
1 9  vaccine. Even though more solicited systemic adverse events were reported in AZD1222 
arm in comparison with the meningococcal vaccine arm, they were resolved within 48 hours 
following vaccination (Li et al 2022).

Vaccine Efficacy and duration of protection 
AstraZeneca 
25 August 2022 
A database lock occurred on 02 September 202 1 (DCO3), following a 6-month data cut-off 
on 30 July 202 1 .  The results of data analyses performed on DCO3 data set became available 
during the reporting period for this PBRER and are provided below. 
The majority of participants (90.3% in the AZD1222 group and 89.8% in the placebo group) 
had been unblinded at the time of the data cut-off date of 30 July 2021 and the median 
follow-up time post second dose for the FVS over the double-blind period was 78.0 days for 
the AZD1222 group and 7 1 .0 days for the placebo group. At this DCO3, evaluation of the 
primary and key secondary efficacy endpoints was repeated using the 6-month data cut-off 
date of 30 July 202 1 ,  as a final supportive analysis of overall vaccine efficacy for the double­
blind period. A total of 325 adjudicated events met the primary endpoint definition [AZD122 
arm 141/17617 (0.80); placebo arm 1 84/8528 (2. 1 6)]. The resulting VE estimate with the 6-
month data cut-off was 66.98% (95% CI: 58.87, 73.50) and was generally consistent with the 
primary efficacy analysis (05 March 202 1 data cut-off date). 
The VE estimate for the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction 
(RT-PCR)-positive severe or critical symptomatic illness was 95.69% (95% CI: 66.33, 99.45) 
which was generally consistent with the primary efficacy analysis (05 March 202 1 data cut­
off date). Evaluation of the exploratory objectives of durability of the efficacy of2 IM doses 
of AZD1222 against symptomatic COVID-1 9  illness and against SARS-CoV-2 infection was 
performed. For these evaluations, the censoring of follow-up time was at the date of first 
Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) vaccination; this captured participants with events 
irrespective ofunblinding in the study. In these analyses, 18.4% of participants in the 
AZD122 group and 73.7% in the placebo group had received an EUA vaccine at the time of 
the data cut-off date of 30 July 202 1 and the median follow-up time post second dose for the 
FVS censored at EUA vaccination was 201 .0 days for the AZD1222 group and 82.0 days for 
the placebo group. A total of 547 adjudicated events met the primary endpoint definition. The 
VE estimate for the 6-month data cut-off analysis censored at EUA vaccination was 65.05% 
(95% CI: 58.46, 70.60). The VE estimate for the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive 
severe or critical symptomatic illness was 92. 12% (95% CI 78. 17, 97. 15). 
It should be noted that for the 6-month data analysis, median duration of follow-up after the 
second dose was longer for participants in the AZD1222 group compared with participants in 
the placebo group prior to vaccination with an authorized/approved vaccine (201 .0 days and 
78.0 days, respectively). The duration of follow-up for participants in the placebo group was 
impacted by unblinding and the receipt ofan Emergency Use Authorization vaccine. 
Using the data cut-off date of 30 July 202 1 ,  analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint was 
conducted using the FVS, censored at EUA vaccination.

With this censoring approach, there were 328 events in the AZD1222 group and 2 1 9  events in 
the placebo group, with a VE estimate of65.05% and a lower bound of the 95% CI of 
58.46%, which is consistent with the overall VE estimate for 6-month data cut-off analysis 
against symptomatic illness for the double-blind period. 
As with 6-month data cut-off analysis against symptomatic illness for the double-blind 
period, VE efficacy was observed across age groups. In participants � 1 8  to < 65 years of age, 
there were 301 events in the AZD1222 group and 1 94 events in the placebo group, with a VE 
estimate of 62.43% and a lower bound of the 95% CI of 54.98%. In participants � 65 years of 
age in the FVS, there were 27 events in the AZD1222 group and 25 events in the placebo 
group, with a VE estimate of 82.60% and a lower bound of the 95% CI of 70.00%. 
Immunogenicity 
During the reporting period immunogenicity data became available showing the waning of 
humoral immunogenicity through 6 months. 
The humoral immunogenicity of AZD1222 was determined using validated bioanalytical 
methods to assess S-binding, RBD-binding, nucleocapsid-binding, and pseudo-neutralizing 
antibodies. All analyses excluded any assessments made after unblinding, after administration 
of an EUA vaccine, or after intake of other exclusionary restricted medication. Overall, 
AZD1222 generated a robust humoral response. For seronegative participants at baseline in 
the immunogenicity analysis set, an increase in S-binding antibodies was detectable 14 days 
after a first dose of AZD1222. S-binding antibodies further increased after a second dose, 
peaking 14 days after a second dose. Anti-S responses were maintained through at least Day 
1 80, waning from the peak responses induced at D43 as expected but still above the titers 
observed after a first dose. Geometric Mean Titres (GMTs) in the placebo group were 
increased at Day 1 80, possibly due to under-reporting of EUA COVID-1 9  vaccines received 
outside of the study. RBD responses had similar kinetics of induction as S-binding antibodies. 
Neutralizing antibody responses had similar kinetics of induction as S-binding antibodies; 
however, GMTs peaked at 28 days after the second dose. Neutralizing antibody titers were 
maintained through at least Day 1 80 with titers still notably higher than those observed after a 
first dose. 
Quantification of nAbs and Spike binding antibodies over time, demonstrated that highest 
level ofnAbs was observed at Day 57 (28 days after Dose 2). At Day 90 (approximately 60 
days after Dose 2), nAb levels had dropped by approximately 20%, with further waning to 
less than 50% of the maximum at Day 1 80. Anti-S and anti-RBD responses peak at Day 43 to 
Day 57 and wane by Day 1 80, as expected, though the levels remain above the baseline titres 
prior to vaccination. These data support administration of a booster dose of AZD 1222 as early 
as 3 months following primary series vaccination.

Safety results at the 6-month data cut-off were generally consistent with safety findings at the 
primary analysis, with no new or emerging safety issues identified. Overall, AZD1222 
remains well-tolerated up to 6 months post dose. The AE profile continued to be consistent 
with AEs commonly observed following vaccine administration. The majority of AEs 
following administration of AZD1222 were mild or moderate in severity.  In the AZD1222 
group, a small proportion of SAEs and Adverse Event of Special Interest ( AES Is) were 
reported, with no clinically meaningful findings.

with the goal of 1300 previously vaccinated participants receiving single-dose vaccination 
and 1290 unvaccinated participants receiving 2-dose primary vaccination. In addition, 
seropositive participants were enrolled (with a cap of 10% of the seronegative population or 
225 participants) to support exploratory analysis is these participants. 
In both the single-dose booster treatment regimen and the 2-dose primary vaccination 
treatment regimen, participants will receive study intervention consisting of IM 
administration of either AZD1222 (5x l 010 vp) or AZD2816 (5 x 1 010 vp). Participants 
receiving a 2-dose primary vaccination will be dosed at intervals of 4 weeks (for AZD1222

AZD1222 or AZD2816 in participants previously vaccinated with either AZD1222 or a 
messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccine, including for those in the Seronegative Safety 
Analysis Set, was consistent with the known safety profile of AZD1222 administered as a 2-

Overall Safety, Efficacy and immunogenicity 
7.2.2 
The safety, efficacy and immunogenicity of a two-dose regimen of V AXZEVRIA has been 
currently investigated in 1 1  ongoing clinical trials. The initial VE against symptomatic 
disease of 66.7% (95% CI: 57.4%, 74.0%) (p < 0.001) demonstrated in a pooled analyses of 
four trials (COV00l ,  COV002, COV003, COV005) was confirmed in a large study conducted 
mainly in the United States of America (USA) (VE=74%; 95CI: 65.34, 80.47). The vaccine 
has also shown to be highly immunogenic after a single dose, with increase in seroconversion 
after a second dose. Moreover, adults (including those over the age of 65 years) with pre­
existing comorbidity showed similar VE and immune responses when compared to the 
general population. The safety of V AXZEVRIA has been evaluated in ongoing clinical trials. 
No safety concerns have arisen from these ongoing V AXZEVRIA /AZD28 1 6  clinical trials.

Clemens et al 2022 study (RHH-001 trial) evaluated V AXZEVRIA (previously AZD1222) 
as a heterologous booster after a 2-dose primary series of the inactivated whole-virion 
adjuvanted vaccine CoronaVac. This study also evaluated COMIRNATY (BNT162b2/Pfizer 
vaccine) and JCOVDEN (previously COVID-1 9  VACCINE Jansen/ AD26.COV2-S/Jansen 
vaccine) compared to a third dose homologous booster of CoronaVac. After 28 days, all 
heterologous boosting elicited a significantly superior response (p<0.0001) in anti-Spike IgG 
concentration and pseudo-neutralising titres compared to homologous boosting with 
CoronaVac. The V AXZEVRIA boost elicited a 90-fold rise in the anti-spike IgG from 
baseline versus a 12.4-fold rise in the homologous booster dosing. All heterologous booster 
regimens induced high concentrations of pseudo-virus nAbs. At Day 28, all groups except for 
the homologous boost in the older adults reached 100% seropositivity: geometric mean ratios 
(heterologous vs homologous) were 8.7 (95% CI: 5.9 to 12.9) for JCOVDEN, 2 1 .5 (95% CI: 
14.5 to 3 1 .9) for COMIRNATY, and 10.6 (95% CI: 7.2 to 15.6) for AZD1222. Live virus 
nAbs were also boosted against the Delta (B. 1 .617.2) and Omicron variants (B. 1 . 1 .529). 
These data provide supportive evidence of AZD1222's immunogenicity when used as a 
heterologous booster. 
Jara et al 2022 study also evaluated the vaccine effectiveness of V AXZEVRIA as a 
heterologous booster after a 2-dose primary series of Corona Vac (Sinovac COVID-1 9  
vaccine). This study was a large prospective national cohort sample following campaign 
immunization with Corona Vac in Chile, and assessed the effectiveness of a third dose of 
either CoronaVac, COMIRNATY, or V AXZEVRIA. Heterologous boosting with 
V AXZEVRIA, following a two-dose CoronaVac primary vaccination series, yielded vaccine 
effectiveness of 97.7% (95% CI: 97.3 to 98.0) against COVID-19-related hospitalisation, 
98.9% (95% CI: 98.5 to 99.2) against ICU admission, and 98. 1 % (95% CI: 97.3 to 98.6) 
against death. Safety information was not collected in this study. These data provide further 
supportive evidence of V AXZEVRIA's immunogenicity and efficacy profile when used as a 
heterologous booster. 
Munoz-Valle et al 2022 study evaluated V AXZEVRIA as a heterologous booster after 
primary immunisation with the adenoviral vector vaccine Convidecia (Ad5-nCoV,CanSino 
Biologics Inc, China). This study involved 62 participants from a prior study ofConvidecia 
who had received a heterologous booster with V AXZEVRIA, JCOVDEN, COMIRNATY, or 
mRNA-127 at 4.5 to 5 months after single-dose primary vaccination with Convidecia. A 
control group of 62 unboosted individuals was matched with the boosted group for age, 
gender, treatment, COVID-1 9  history, and baseline antibody levels 21 days after primary 
vaccination. At baseline, the median percentage of neutralizing antibodies was similar in 
booster and control groups (78. 16% vs. 78.65%, p > 0.05), but at 6 months post-booster was 
significantly higher in the boosted group versus controls (96.41 % vs. 89.33%, p = 0.0004), 
with no differences between vaccines. There were also no differences in adverse events 
between booster vaccines. The authors concluded that a heterologous regimen of 1  dose of

Convidecia followed by a booster dose of a different vaccine is safe and results in a robust 
humoral immune response. These data support the use of V AXZEVRIA as a heterologous 
booster after a primary series of an adenovirus vector vaccine. 
Summary and conclusions 
Based on the studies discussed above, there is evidence that a heterologous 3rd booster dose of 
V AXZEVRIA elicits a strong and broad humoral immune response after a primary series of 
several vaccine classes. These include mRNA vaccines, as reported in D7220C00001 and 
COY-BOOST, inactivated whole virion vaccine, as reported in RHH-001 and the Jara study, 
and adenovirus vector vaccines, as reported in the Mufi.oz-Vallee study. There is limited 
information on the use ofV AXZEVRIA with the protein subunit vaccine NVX-CoV2373, but 
use ofNVX-CoV2373 after a primary series ofV AXZEVRIA was immunogenic and did not 
raise any safety issues in COY-BOOST. Importantly, no additional safety concerns have been 
raised by the use of V AXZEVRIA in combination with other COVID-1 9  vaccine classes, 
whether as a heterologous booster or as a primary series followed by heterologous boost with 
another vaccine. AstraZeneca considers that data on the immunogenicity and safety profile of 
V AXZEVRIA support its use as a heterologous 3rd booster dose after a range of other 
COVID-1 9  vaccine classes. 
Persistence of Immunogenicity 
9.1.2 
During the reporting period, relevant studies that included data on persistence of immunity of 
V AXZEVRIA are described below. 
These data add to evidence previously described in Munro et al 2021 COVBOOST study 
described in previous PBRER. 
Xinxue Liu et al. 2022 performed further analyses of data from COY-BOOST study to assess 
the persistence ofhumoral and cellular immune response against SARS-COV-2 infection 
three months after third dose boosters with different types of vaccines, including 
V AXZEVRIA. In this study, the authors demonstrated that, a third dose booster of 
V AXZEVRIA given after primary immunization with two doses of BNT/BNT was able to 
yield similar immune response when a homologous third dose booster ofBNT was given 
after primary immunization with BNT/BNT. Moreover, anti-Spike antibodies persisted for at 
least 84 days after primary immunisation with AZD1222 followed by a booster with another 
adenoviral vector vaccine, namely Jcovden, a Janssen COVID-1 9  vaccine using another 
adenoviral vector platform (JCOVDEN). The decay ratio of anti-Spike IgG GMT between 
Days 28 and 84 was lower after a third dose booster with JCOVDEN than with BNT after 
primary vaccination with V AXZEVRIA, suggesting greater persistence of anti-Spike 
antibodies with JCOVDEN than with BNT. The Day 84 to Day 28 GMT ratio was 0.72 (95% 
CI: 0.68 to 0.77) for JCOVDEN and 0.43 (95% CI: 0.41 to 0.46) for COMIRNATY, with a

GMR for JCOVDEN versus COMIRNATY of 1 .66 (95% CI: 1 .45 to 1 .90). These data 
indicate that while anti-Spike IgG at Day 84 was lower for JCOVDEN than for 
COMIRNATY after a AZD1222/AZD1222 primary series, the JCOVDEN booster had 
greater antibody persistence. GMRs for pseudo-neutralising and live viral nAbs of AZD 1222 
and JCOVDEN boosters at Day 28 and Day 84 were consistent with those seen for anti-Spike 
IgG. In addition, The decay rate of cellular responses were similar between all the vaccine 
schedules and doses. The authors concluded that, by Day 84 post- third dose booster, 
adenoviral vector vaccines may be as immunogenic as following a third dose of an mRNA 
vaccine. The anti-spike IgG in adenoviral vector vaccine arms (V AXZEVRIA and Ad26) 
after the BNT/BNT prime were the most persistent schedules up to D84. 
Real world evidence data on duration of protection 
9.1.3 
Andrews et al 2022a: In the first of two publications falling within the reporting period 
(Andrews et al 2022a), vaccine effectiveness (VE) was estimated from a test-negative-control 
design of two doses ofVAXZEVRIA, COMIRNATY, and mRNA-1273 vaccines against 
symptomatic disease as confirmed on polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing, against 
hospitalization within 14 days after confirmation on PCR testing, and against death within 
28 days after confirmation on PCR testing. The analysis was stratified to assess vaccine 
effectiveness against the alpha and delta variants during the periods when they were 
circulating. Moreover, VE of the V AXZEVRIA and CO MIRNA TY vaccines was assessed 
according to participant age and status with regard to coexisting conditions and over time 
since receipt of the second vaccine dose to investigate waning of effectiveness separately for 
the alpha and delta variants. 
The authors report that whilst VE peaked in the early weeks after administration of the second 
dose, a decline was observed at 20 weeks after vaccination to 44.3% (95% confidence interval 
[CI]: 43.2 to 45.4) with the V AXZEVRIA vaccine and to 66.3% (95% CI: 65.7 to 66.9) with 
the COMIRNATY vaccine. Waning of vaccine effectiveness was greater in persons 65 years 
of age or older than in those 40 to 64 years of age.  However, VE against hospitalization 
remained high at 80.0% (95% CI: 76.8 to 82.7) with the V AXZEVRIA vaccine and 9 1 .7% 
(95% CI: 90.2 to 93.0) with the COMIRNATY vaccine, and death was 84.8% (95% CI: 76.2 
to 90.3) and 9 1 .9% (95% CI: 88.5 to 94.3), respectively. Greater waning in vaccine 
effectiveness against hospitalization was observed in persons 65 years of age or older in a 
clinically extremely vulnerable group and in persons 40 to 64 years of age with underlying 
medical conditions than in healthy adults. The authors do point out that the analysis with 
V AXZEVRIA boosters is particularly likely to be subject to bias because this vaccine was not 
recommended as a booster in the UK and persons who received V AXZEVRIA were likely to 
have done so because of contraindications to other vaccines.

Real world evidence data on protection against variants of concern 
9.1.4 
In the second publication from Andrews et al 2022b, a test-negative case-control study 
examined the VE against symptomatic disease caused by the Delta and Omicron variants. The 
study included a representative sample of the general population in England who had PCR 
tests performed when prevalence of Omicron had surpassed that of Delta variant in the UK. 
The data set included 886774 persons with symptomatic disease who were infected with the 
Omicron variant, 204154 persons infected with the Delta variant, and 1 572621 test-negative 
controls. 
Protection against severe COVID-1 9  or hospitalisations due to COVID-1 9  was not assessed 
in this study. No effect against the Omicron variant was observed from 20 weeks after a 
primary vaccination with V AXZEVRIA, but the VE of a booster dose with V AXZEVRIA 
was 55.6% at 2 to 4 weeks and 46.7% at 5 to 9 weeks following booster administration. This 
decrease in VE was also noted with a third homologous dose ofBNT, with VE decreasing 
from 67.2% at 2 to 4 weeks to 45.7% after 10 or more weeks, and mRNA-1273, for which 
VE declined from 73.9% after 2 to 4 weeks to 64.4% after 5 to 9 weeks. 
Kirsebom et al 2022 In another real-world evidence study conducted by the United Kingdom 
Health Security Agency (a test-negative case control design was used to estimate the VE of a 
V AXZEVRIA or COMIRNATY booster following a primary series ofV AXZEVRIA against 
symptomatic disease and hospitalisation following infection with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron 
variant in England. This study provides data on the vaccine effectiveness of V AXZEVRIA at 
least 25 weeks after primary immunizations during omicron era. The authors found that, in 
the age group 40-64 years and those aged 65 years and older, VE against symptomatic disease 
caused by the Omicron variant was 8.0% (6.0 to 9.9%) and 1 9.5% ( 1 1 .7 to 26.6%), 
respectively. In those aged 40-64 years, VE against symptomatic disease increased to 6 1 .2% 
(40.9 to 74.6%) one week after receiving a booster with V AXZEVRIA as compared to 58.2% 
(57 to 59.4%) amongst those who received a COMIRNATY booster. Furthermore, waning of 
protection was described for both, V AXZEVRIA and COMIRNATY third dose boosters, 
with reduction of protection with a booster of V AXZEVRIA to 3 7.2% (-44. 1 to 72.6%) at 1 5  
or more weeks after receiving the booster, as compared to 30.6% (26.8 to 34.3%) over the 
same period amongst those who received a third dose of COMIRNATY booster. Protection 
against symptomatic disease in those aged 65 years and older peaked at 66. 1 % (16.6 to 
86.3%) and 68.5% (65.7 to 7 1 .2%) among those who received V AXZEVRIA and 
COMIRNATY boosters, respectively, and waned to 44.5% (22.4 to 60.2%) and 54. 1 %(50.5 
to 57.5%), respectively, after 5 to 9 weeks. VE against hospitalisation following infection 
with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant peaked at 82.3% (64.2 to 91 .3%) after an 
V AXZEVRIA booster and 90.9% after a third dose booster with (88.7 to 92.7%) booster. The 
authors noted differences between the population receiving V AXZEVRIA and the population 
receiving COMIRNATY, with those receiving 3 doses ofV AXZEVRIA more likely to be in 
risk groups; this was also true for Andrews et al 2022b. While V AXZEVRIA-induced

concentrations of neutralising antibodies were lower against the Omicron variant than for 
other variants, no correlates of protection have been established, and clinical effectiveness of 
a V AXZEVRIA booster has been observed in real-world studies against COVID-1 9  due to 
the Omicron variant (Andrews et al 2022b, Kirsebom et al 2022), particularly against 
progression to severe disease, hospitalization, or death. 
No information relevant to the benefit-risk assessment ofV AXZEVRIA was identified from 
any other clinical trial or study sources, during the reporting period.

Most frequently (> 1000) reported vaccination error PTs were Interchange of vaccine 
products; Wrong product administered; Expired product administered; Inappropriate schedule 
of product administration; Incorrect dose administered; Product administered to patient of 
inappropriate age; and Medication error; most of the reports (72%) were not associated with 
other AEs apart from these medication errors. The above medications errors related to 
interchange, wrong product administered is related to interchange of vaccine (heterologous 
administration) for Dose 1 ,  Dose 2 and Dose 3 in many countries; and inappropriate schedule 
may be related to vaccine doses given at spacing intervals not aligned with the product 
information. Most of the reports were received from Brazil (52%), UK (10%), France (6%) 
and Germany ( 4% ). 
A review of the PT Interchange of vaccine products found that these medications errors were 
received mainly from following countries Brazil (45%), France (1 8%), Germany (9%), 
United Kingdom (6%) and Mexico (4%). 
The vaccines most often interchanged with V AXZEVRIA included mRNA-PFIZER, 
CoronaVac, mRNA-Modema, Janssen, mRNA-unspecified, Sputnik and Covaxin Vaccine. 
CoronaVac, mRNA PFIZER, Janssen, and mRNA Modema. vaccines were most often used 
in reports of the PT Wrong product administered. However, there was limited information 
available in narrative to interpret whether the vaccinees received wrong product/vaccine 
voluntarily or by mistake. 
9.2.1 
The following request was places in the PRAC AR: 
Fatal Cases Associated with Vaccination errors 
The MAH is requested to discuss all fatal cases associated with vaccination error in detail in 
next PSURs. 
A review of cumulative vaccination error case reports with case level outcome of death/fatal 
are provided in Appendix  1 1 .  Interchange of vaccine products (n=21) and Incorrect route of 
product administration (n=14) were most frequently reported vaccination error events in these 
reports. Most of the reports with incorrect route of administration (intravenous, 
subcutaneous) were consumer reports and there was limited information on the actual 
medication error. 
Most frequently reported AEs (2'.:3) in these reports were : Headache(? ); Pyrexia(6 ); Cardiac 
arrest (6 ); Dyspnoea (6 ); Death(5 ); Cerebrovascular accident(5 ); Myalgia(4 ); Vomiting (4 
); Nausea(4 ); Dizziness(4 ); Loss of consciousness(4 ); Arthralgia(4 ); Myocardial 
infarction( 4 ); Hypoaesthesia( 4 ); Paraesthesia( 4 ); Asthenia( 4 ); Pain(3 ); Thrombosis(3 ); 
Immobile(3 ); Confusional state(3 ); Malaise(3 ); COVID-19(3 ); Exposure during 
pregnancy(3 ); and Hemiplegia(3 ). 
Reported causes of death in these cases were Dyspnoea (3), Death (2), Thrombosis (2), 
Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (1), Abortion spontaneous (1), Pulmonary embolism

Skin discolouration (1), Pyrexia (1), Asthenia (1), Circulatory collapse (1), Vein rupture (1), 
Urosepsis (1), Haemorrhage intracranial (1), Vomiting (1), Headache (1) and 
Hypersensitivity ( 1 ). 
Review of these fatal cases did not identify safety issues in relation to type of vaccination 
errors. 
Summary and Conclusion 
Most frequently reported vaccination errors along with other AEs included Inappropriate 
schedule of product administration, Incorrect route of product administration, Interchange of 
vaccine products, Medication error, Product dose omission issue, Incorrect dose 
administered, Incomplete course of vaccination, and Expired product administered; and 72% 
of the vaccination errors cases were not associated with other AEs. Most of the AEs reported 
for these vaccination errors were related to the reactogenicity events such as Pyrexia, 
Headache, Chills, Fatigue, Pain, Pain in extremity, Myalgia, Arthralgia, and Malaise. There 
was no clustering of AEs or AESI's with any of the vaccination error types. 
A review of all the vaccination error AE reports received during interval and cumulative 
period did not demonstrate any medication error-emergent safety pattern associated with 
V AXZEVRIA. No new relevant patterns of vaccination errors or new safety concerns were 
identified during the reporting period. 
Reports related to V AXZEVRIA vaccination errors will continue to be monitored by 
AstraZeneca through standard surveillance activities.

NON-CLINICAL DATA 
There were no major safety findings from any AstraZeneca-sponsored non-clinical in vivo 
and in vitro studies of V AXZEVRIA ongoing or completed during the reporting period. 
11 
LITERATURE 
AstraZeneca has reviewed the published non-clinical scientific literature relevant to 
V AXZEVRIA. No relevant new non-clinical safety information or information with potential 
impact on the benefit or risk evaluations, during the reporting period, were identified 
following review of literature. 
AstraZeneca conducts comprehensive monitoring of peer-reviewed published scientific 
literature and unpublished manuscripts routinely on an ongoing basis. The search strategy 
includes V AXZEVRIA and other COVID-1 9  vaccines in order to identify potential class 
related findings.

Relevant literature articles containing new and significant safety findings relevant to 
V AXZEVRIA published during the review period were retrieved. Literature articles from 
clinical/observational/real world studies on vaccine effectiveness and booster dose are 
summarized in Section 9. 1 .  Articles of interest related to event reviews completed as part of 
Health Authority requests, Important identified and Potential risks or Missing information 
have been included within the review of those safety concerns throughout section 1 5  .2 and 
section 1 6. Other articles containing new and significant safety findings are summarized 
below. 
Vaccine-related cutaneous manifestations (A vaUone et al 2022) 
Avallone et al 2022 conducted a systematic review of 229 articles according to the Preferred 
Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A search 
on MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library was conducted using the combination 
of the following keywords and medical subject heading (MeSH) terms: COVID vaccine, 
dermatology, rash, skin, cutaneous, BNT162, COMIRNATY, AstraZeneca, and mRNA-
1273. The time range of our search was from O 1 March 2020 to 04 November 202 1 .  
Objective: To provide an extensive overview of all the vaccine-related cutaneous 
manifestations reported in the literature thus far. 
Results: A total of 229 articles with data from 4649 patients with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine­
related dermatological manifestations were included in the analysis. A total of 5941  SARS­
Co V-2 vaccine-related dermatological manifestations were gathered. Local injection-site 
reactions were the most frequently observed, followed by rash/unspecified cutaneous 
eruption, urticaria! rashes, angioedema, herpes zoster, 
morbilliform/maculopapular/erythematous macular eruption, pityriasis rosea and pityriasis 
rosea-like eruptions, and other less common dermatological manifestations. Flares of pre­
existing dermatological conditions were also reported. Rash/Unspecified cutaneous eruption 
was the most common dermatological manifestation reported for AstraZeneca vaccine. 
Overall conclusion as per author: Cutaneous adverse reactions following SARS-CoV-2 
vaccine administration seem to be heterogeneous, rather infrequent, and not life-threatening. 
Vaccinated patients should be monitored for skin manifestations, and dermatological 
evaluation should be offered, when needed. 
AstraZeneca comment 
Cutaneous adverse events such as rash and urticaria and injections site reactions are listed in 
the V AXZEVRIA CDS. Cutaneous reactions are the most common form of ADRs, occurring 
in 2%-3% of inpatient and in approximately 2% of outpatient patients in general population. 
Also, a large majority of cutaneous reactions post vaccination were mild and self-limiting, 
and public health benefit of vaccination is considered to outweigh the rare occurrence of 
these events.

OTHER PERIODIC REPORTS 
There have been no significant findings from other periodic reports provided by other parties

LACK OF EFFICACY IN CONTROLLED CLINICAL TRIALS 
During the reporting period one trial was completed (Study D8 l l l C00002). In addition to 
one-year follow up results obtained from this study, the section below provides an update on 
data obtained on the variant of concern, Omicron. 
As described in Section 7 .2. 1 ,  Study D8 1 1 1  C00002 assessed the safety and immunogenicity 
ofV AXZEVRIA in 256 participants in Japan across all age groups. After one year of follow 
up, it was observed that humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 waned over time from 
previously reported peak responses post-second dose. At Day 365, anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike­
binding (spike) and RBD mean antibody titers remained above Day 1 5  levels across all ages. 
Neutralizing antibody titers declined and were below detection levels in many participants by 
Day 365. Rates of unsolicited and serious adverse events were consistent with previous 
reports. Overall, V AXZEVRIA was well tolerated in Japanese adults across all age groups. 
Expected waning in humoral responses against SARS-CoV-2 were observed over the course 
of the one-year follow up; however, total spike and RBD mean antibody titers remained 
elevated above Day 15 levels. 
Recent publications as described in Section 1 0  and Section 1 7  support the thesis that 
V AXZEVRIA confers good VE against symptomatic COVID-1 9  resulting from infection 
with the Omicron variant and it is particularly effective in preventing severe disease, 
hospitalizations and death. 
No other data regarding lack of efficacy that would constitute a significant risk to the treated 
population were received during the reporting period. 
Immunogenicty data on Omicron variant of concern 
As described in the last PBRER, a collaborative work between ASTRAZENECA, the 
University of Oxford, and the UK Health Securities Agency (UKHSA) demonstrated that a 
3rd booster dose of the V AXZEVRIA vaccine would increase the limited protection offered 
by a 2-primary immunization series of the V AXZEVRIA vaccine. 
More recently, researchers at the University of Oxford have assessed neutralization of the 
emerging Omicron sub-lineages BA.4 and BA.5 (in addition to BA.2) by serum from 
individuals vaccinated with 3 doses of V AXZEVRIA or CO MIRNA TY Tuekprakhon et al 
2022). Assays were performed using serum obtained 28 days following the 3rd dose. While 
BA.4/5 showed reduced neutralization compared with BA. 1 and BA.2, the reductions were 
modest. For V AXZEVRIA, neutralization titers for BA.4/5 were reduced 2.1 -fold compared 
with BA. 1 (p < 0.0001) and 1 .8-fold compared with BA.2 (p < 0.0001). For COMIRNATY, 
neutralization titers were reduced 3.1-fold (p < 0.0001) and 3 . 1 -fold (p < 0.0001) compared

with BA. 1 and BA.2, respectively. The authors concluded that although these reductions in 
titers may reduce the effectiveness of the vaccines at preventing infection, particularly at 
longer time points, it would be expected that protection would remain against severe disease. 
CD8+ T cell responses have been identified as important mediators of COVID-1 9  disease in 
murine and non-human primate models of COVID-1 9, and are thought to be particularly 
important for the prevention of severe disease. T cell Receptors (TCR) sequencing analysis 
has identified that the immunodominant region of Spike recognised by CD8+ T cells 
(Swanson et al 2021) is not impacted by the Spike mutations present in the Omicron variant 
(including BA.4/BA.5 sublineages). T cell data are now available from the ongoing 
AstraZeneca-sponsored study D7220C00001 ,  in which participants received a 3rd booster 
dose of V AXZEVRIA after a primary series of V AXZEVRIA or an mRNA vaccine. Analysis 
of spike peptide T-cell responses at Day 14 after a 3rd booster dose of V AXZEVRIA showed 
similar levels of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells against the ancestral SARS-CoV-2 strain or the 
Omicron variant. These data support the conclusion that protection would remain against 
severe disease caused by Omicron variant sub-lineages. 
As described in Sections 9. 1 .4 and 1 7.2.4, real-world evidence has since supported the 
effectiveness of V AXZEVRIA in preventing infection, particularly severe infection leading 
to hospitalisation, by the Omicron variant.

LATE-BREAKING INFORMATION 
After the data lock point of the PBRER (28 June 2022), V AXZEVRIA CDS updated on O 1 
July 2022 and 2 signals were validated, as mentioned below: 
CDS Update 
•  VAXZEVRIA CDS was updated on 01 July 2022 (Version 19.0) to include Tinnitus as 
an ADR Section 4.8 (undesirable effects) with frequency of uncommon, see section 4, 
1 6.2.5.2 and 1 6.3.4.2 
Signal Evaluation 
• 
Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP): The signal for ITP was re-opened based on well­
documented case reports from the published literature. AstraZeneca internally validated 
the signal on 06 July 2022 and the topic is currently undergoing evaluation as per 
AstraZeneca's signal detection and evaluation processes. Conclusions and any 
recommended actions for this signal will be communicated in the next PBRER, or earlier 
as necessary 
•  Cutaneous Vasculitis (CV): The signal for cutaneous vasculitis was identified based on 
well-documented case series from published literature cases. Subsequently a request on 
the same topic was received from PRAC (Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment 
Committee) Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) assessment report (see section 15.2). 
AstraZeneca internally validated the signal on 15 July 2022. Cumulative evaluation of 
this signal is presented in Appendix 1 6  
On 1 8  August 2022, upon further evaluation of this topic AstraZeneca considered that 
there is a reasonable possibility of causal relationship between V AXZEVRIA and

Cutaneous vasculitis. CDS Section 4.8 is in the progress to be updated to include 
cutaneous vasculitis as an ADR (frequency: not known). The updated CDS will be 
internally approved before the due date of this PBRER. Corresponding changes to local 
labels or product leaflets are also warranted. This revision is in the late stage of being 
finalized. Details of this signal evaluation are presented in Section 1 5.2. 14 and Appendix 
1 6  
•  Literature: An AstraZeneca co-authored article (Laffan et al 2022) regarding the risk of 
thrombosis with thrombocytopenia was published on-line on 19 August 2022. This 
article presents a review oflCSR case characteristics reported to AstraZeneca through to 
28 December 202 1 .  This article includes data and analyses already included in previous 
PBRERs/monthly summary reports, as well as in the cumulative review presented in 
section 1 6.3.2. l ofthis PBRER, and therefore presents no new, additional evidence. The 
article does not change the characterisation of this risk and is included in section 1 6.3.2. 1 
and 1 6.4. 1 . 1  for information.

OVERVIEW OF SIGNALS (NEW, ONGOING OR CLOSED) 
15.1 
Overview of Validated Signals (New, Ongoing or Closed) 
AstraZeneca are required to carry out pharmacovigilance on a routine basis according to the 
legislation. Routine pharmacovigilance is described in the pharmacovigilance system master 
file. However, a summary of signal identification is provided below. 
Signals may be identified during: 
•  Review of individual case safety reports (ICSRs) arising from marketed use of the 
medicinal product or during clinical trials 
•  Regular analysis of aggregate ICSR data, including statistics of disproportionate 
reporting applied to the AstraZeneca global safety database and, as appropriate, publicly 
available databases of AEs (the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Adverse Event 
Reporting System, the World Health Organisation VigiBase and the Eudravigilance Data 
Analysis System (EVDAS) databases) 
•  Regular review of published biomedical articles and conference abstracts 
•  Review of results arising from AstraZeneca-sponsored trials and externally-sponsored 
scientific research (previously referred to as investigator-sponsored trials) 
•  Review ofreports from the product complaints management system (ie, product quality 
complaints) 
Safety-related enquiries from Health Authorities, healthcare professionals, and consumers are 
also considered a source of signals. Relevant findings from preclinical trials and new safety 
information on products with the same or similar modes of action to the medicinal product 
are also considered. 
The above are considered the most likely sources of signals, however relevant information 
from other sources is not excluded from consideration.

In the analysis of aggregate ICSRs arising from marketed use of AstraZeneca products, 
qualitative and pre-defined quantitative criteria are applied to the data in order to identify 
signals for evaluation. Quantitative analysis includes the use of algorithms to generate 
statistics of disproportionate reporting, including significant changes in these  statistics over 
time. The initial evaluation of identified signals may lead to a more detailed evaluation and if 
a potential new risk is identified, a detailed review is undertaken by a scientific and medical 
forum. 
A tabulation of validated signals that were ongoing or closed during the reporting period is 
presented in Appendix 3. 
There were three validated signals that were either ongoing or closed during the reporting 
period. The validated signals are provided in Table 21 along with a cross-reference, where 
applicable, to the sections of the PBRER where further detail is provided.

Literature 
A literature search was conducted cumulatively through DLP 28 June 2022 from databases in 
Embase, InsightMeme and PubMed to identify articles that discuss a plausible mechanism for 
Tinnitus in association with V AXZEVRIA or with other COVID-1 9  vaccines. 
The search retrieved 14 relevant articles, those were discussed and presented in the review 
below. 
Based on the available literature, the precise mechanism of action is still not clear, however, 
some possible mechanisms of action were proposed by the authors, such as: 
•  A hypersensitivity reaction causing an abnormal autoimmune response; mediated by 
circulating immune complexes or cytotoxic vestibule-cochlear autoantibodies which 
can lead to a localised inflammation that damages the inner ear microvessels, or a 
vasculitic event with subsequent localised damage to the cochlea. (Ciorba et al 201 8, 
Shamriz et al 201 8, Oldstone 2014, Ahmed et al 2021, Parrino et al 202 1 ,  Garg and 
Paliwal 202 1 ,  Pisani et al 2022 and Di Mauro et al 2022). 
•  An immunisation anxiety-related reaction is also postulated, as anxiety has also been 
related to the severity and persistency of Tinnitus. (Elarbed et al 2021 ,  Parrino et al 
2021 ,  Pisani et al 2022, Gold et al 2020). 
•  Molecular mimicry, considering a cross reactivity between anti-spike SARS-CoV-2 
antibodies and otologic antigens, plus hepta-peptide resemblance between the 
coronavirus spike glycoprotein and human proteins. The anti-spike antibodies may 
potentially react with antigens anywhere along the auditory pathway and initiate an 
inflammatory reaction involving the tympanic membrane, ossicular chain, cochlea, 
cochlear vessels, organ of Corti, etc. (Kanduc and Shoenfeld 2020, Tseng et al 2021, 
Vojdani et al 2020, Ahmed et al 2021, Pisani et al 2022, Garg and Paliwal 202 1 ,  
Wichova H et al 202 1 ). 
•  Autoimmune inner ear disease also must be considered in the differential diagnosis, 
which may have increased the likelihood of a dysregulated autoimmune response, 
although it typically differs in clinical presentation. (Medina et al 2022, Parrino et al 
2021 ,  Ciorba et al 201 8). 
Despite these possible mechanisms of action, the authors have also suggested the review of 
pre-existing history of autoimmune disorder and anxiety which have been related to the 
severity and persistency of Tinnitus (Elarbed et al 202 1 ,  Pisani et al 2022, Ahmed et al 2021, 
Parrino et al 2021 ). This also includes underlying infections, such as COVID-1 9  (Di Mauro et 
al 2022), or a history of glaucoma, thrombosis, or vascular conditions (Ahmed et al 2021 ).

AstraZeneca performed a comprehensive literature review through DLP 28 June 2022 with 
focus on identifying articles that discuss a plausible mechanism. AstraZeneca acknowledges 
the authors' views and suggestions concerning the mechanism of action. However, any 
further exploration of the hypothesized mechanisms in mechanism-based studies or 
demonstration of a conclusive mechanism could not be identified and thereby any specific 
mechanism of action for Tinnitus following COVID-1 9  vaccination remains speculative. 
Following a recent signal evaluation, Section 4.8 of the V AXZEVRIA CDS was updated to 
include Tinnitus. It is AstraZeneca's opinion that this topic is adequately described in the 
updated V AXZEVRIA CDS and will no longer discuss it in future PBRERs, unless 
significant new safety information arises.

Tinnitus (n=595, 9.2%) and headache (n=425, 6.5%) were the most common events that were 
co-reported in these cases with Hearing loss: 
•  1385 [75.6%] of the events were serious (220 medically confirmed and 1 1 65 non-medically 
confirmed);  reported  seriousness  criteria  in  these  cases  were  medically  important  event 
(1 1 13 [80.4%]), disability (412 [29.7%]), hospitalization (145 [10.5%]), life threatening (18 
[1 .3%]) and/or the  event reportedly resulted in death  (2  [0. 1 %]). An event may have  met 
more than one criterion for seriousness. The remaining 446 (24.4%) events were non-serious 
(78 medically confirmed and 368 non-medically confirmed). 
•  Of the  1 83 1  events, the outcome was reported in 28.9% (529/1831) as Recovered and/or 
Recovering, 3.8% (70/1 83 1) recovered with sequelae, not recovered 53.2% (975/183 1) and 
0. 1 % (02) of the events as fatal. The outcome of the remaining 13.9 % (255 out of 1 83 1 )  of 
events were reported as unknown. 
•  Amongst 340 events with reported outcome  'recovered'  or  'recovered with sequelae,' the 
event duration was reported in  125  (36.8%)  cases. Range  was  (0-348 days),  Median  and 
mean duration was 2 days and 16 days respectively. For 9 1  cases (26.8%), the event resolved 
within 7 days and for the remaining 34 (10%) cases the event resolved after 7 days.

Brighton Collaboration Classification Assessment 
AstraZeneca 
25 August 2022 
The Brighton Collaboration Classification (BCC) case definition (Carol Liu et al. 2020) for 
Hearing loss was used for the review of the data available in the case reports. Furthermore, 
causality assessment according to WHO-UMC criteria was completed for cases fulfilling 
BCC Level 1 ,  2 or 3. 
Based on this approach, out of the 281 medically confirmed case reports retrieved 
cumulatively through DLP 28 June 2022, 8 (2.8%) cases fulfilled BCC Level 1 criteria, 4 
(1 .4%) fulfilled BCC Level 2 criteria, 6 (2. 1  %) fulfilled BCC Level 3 criteria, 260 (92.5%) 
fulfilled BCC Level 4 criteria and 3 ( 1 . 1  % ) fulfilled BCC Level 5 criteria. As Levels 1 ,  2 and 
3 can be considered particularly relevant for fulfilling reasonable BCC diagnostic certainty 
for Hearing loss, these case report assessments are therefore presented in Table 27, Table 28 
and Table 29 for each BCC Level accordingly. 
Brighton Collaboration Classification Level 1 
Of the 281 medically confirmed case reports, 8 (2.8%) case reports fulfilled BCC Level 1 
criteria. These case reports are summarized in Table 27 below:

Brighton Collaboration Level 4. 
AstraZeneca 
25 August 2022 
Of the total 281 medically confirmed case reports of Hearing loss with V AXZEVRIA 
reported, 260 (92.5%) fulfilled BCC Level 4 criteria. These case reports did not fulfil criteria 
for certainty levels 1 ,  2 and 3 as there was insufficient information to confirm the diagnosis 
or medical assessment of the case. 
Brighton Collaboration Level 5. 
Three cases ( 1 . 1  % ) of the 281 medically confirmed case reports fulfilled BCC Level 5 
criteria excluded due to an alternative diagnosis and/or not consistent with Hearing loss. 
Events with fatal outcome 
Of the 1 83 1  events of Hearing loss reported, 2 events of interest ( deafness neurosensory, 
deafness) in 2 cases (0. 1  %) were reported with fatal outcome, of which 1 case was medically 
confirmed. 
Case #1: 
The case was received from a physician via regulatory authority in United Kingdom 
(MHRA), regarding 35 years old female vaccinee with relevant medical history of 
sensorineural hearing loss, neuropathic pain, and epilepsy since unknown date. Patient 
received V AXZEVRIA (1st dose) on 4 February 2021 ,  and an unknown date the patient 
experienced deafness neurosensory. Laboratory data included negative COVID-1 9  test, INR 
with 2.84, APTT prolonged 1 .97, fibrinogen 1 . 1 ,  platelet count 163, C-Reactive protein 
(CRP) 28, HCO3  8, lactate 16, potassium 3.5, blood glucose 7.5, oxygen saturation was 88, 
blood pressure 1 1 9/83, heart rate 1 12, chest X ray with right base opacification and raised left 
hemi diaphragm, ECG showing sinus tachycardia, CT head, chest, and abdomen without 
abnormalities, positive CTPA (Computed Tomography Pulmonary Angiogram) for 
pulmonary embolism was described. Patient died on 1 7  February 2021 An autopsy was 
performed, and the cause of death was provided as pulmonary embolism, acute 
cardiovascular failure ( confirmed at autopsy), pulmonary thromboembolism, deep vein 
thrombosis, hypotensive, heel pain, afebrile, metabolic acidosis, CTPA no clot, platelet count 
greater than 1 50/\ 109/1, acute chest syndrome, chest infection, sickle cell disease, pulmonary 
artery hypertension, sensorineural hearing loss, Hank's Balanced Salt Solution (HBBS), chest 
pain, cardiac arrest, unwell, sweating, sinus tachycardia, shortness of breath, crepitations, 
hypokalaemia, hypoglycaemia, hyperlactatemia, circulatory collapse and disseminated 
intravascular coagulation (DIC). 
AstraZeneca comment: There is limited information on clinical manifestations, audiogram, 
tuning fork examination, otoacoustic emission, or auditory brainstem response and hence 
assessed as BCC4. Medical history includes sensorineural hearing loss, and epilepsy, 
however there is limited information about onset, duration, clinical progress, and baseline 
general condition. Treatment work-up was also not reported. There was conflicting 
information reported regarding finding of clot on CTP A. Due to unknown time to onset the

WHO-UMC causality was assessed as "Unassessable/Unclassified" with risk 
factors/confounders, ie, confounded by medical history of sensorineural hearing loss. 
Case #2: 
The case was received from a consumer via regulatory authority in United Kingdom 
(MHRA), concerning a male vaccinee with unknown age. On unknown date patient received 
V AXZEVRIA (1st dose), and on an unspecified date the patient experienced deafness. On 
1 3  October 2021 patient died, no details regarding autopsy, however cause of death was 
reported as deafness by narrative. 
AstraZeneca comment: There is limited information for clinical manifestations, audiogram, 
tuning fork examination, otoacoustic emission, or auditory brainstem response and hence the 
case was assessed as BCC4. Treatment work-up was not reported within the narrative. Due to 
unknown time to onset the WHO-UMC causality is "Unassessable/Unclassified" with limited 
information, the lack of information being for medical history, concomitant medication, and 
aetiology workup. 
Rechallenge / Recurrence case reports 
Cumulatively through DLP 28 June 2022, in 4 (0.2%) out of 1719 case reports, the vaccinees 
experienced Hearing loss after the first dose, and a recurrence or worsening with the second 
dose of vaccination indicating potential recurrence/ rechallenge. All 4 cases were from 
spontaneous sources and one of 4 was medically confirmed. 
One case report 
[25%]) was identified within the Risk Window TTO of 28 
days (0-28) and therefore WHO-UMC causality was considered as "Possible". Alternative 
causal factors were noted in 2 (50%) out of 4 case reports, and a comprehensive causal 
attribution of other disease and drugs was not possible to identify for 2 (50%) cases, due to 
unknown TTO, insufficient information on laboratory investigations, baseline health 
condition, relevant medical history, and concomitant medications. These case reports are 
summarized in Table 30 below:

Cases were considered to have "risk factors/confounders" where the event could also be explained by the 
vaccinee's diseases, or where relevant risk factors were present, or concomitant medications that could 
potentially contribute to the development of the event were reported. 
Amongst 281 medically confirmed cases of Hearing loss, 85 (30.2%) cases were identified 
either with relevant risk or confounding factors. These are presented by the following 
categories for risk / confounding factors in descending order of frequency in Table 32.

Overall, the review of medically confirmed cases did not raise any new relevant safety 
information for V AXZEVRIA. 
Observed Versus Expected (O/E) Analyses 
Based on review of Truven Marketscan (2019), the background incidence rate(s) (IR) of 
Sensorineural Hearing Loss (SNHL) is estimated at 309.86 per 1 00,000 persons per annum. 
AstraZeneca also conducted an observed versus expected analysis for the event of interest 
Hearing loss using the cumulative observed number of cases. The Risk Window of 0-28 days 
was derived upon review of Carol Liu et al. 2020. 
An 0/E analysis of hearing loss was conducted cumulatively through DLP 28 June 2022 and 
presented in Table 33. The OE analysis was conducted using risk window of28 days and is 
stratified by age and gender in the EEA, UK, Brazil, and Australia. 
Conservatively, the exposure for global reports (448306152) is based on doses administered 
in 1 3  markets as explained in Appendix 8.

Literature 
A literature search was conducted within the period of 29 December 2021 - 28 June 2022, 
from databases in Embase, InsightMeme and PubMed to review the occurrence of Hearing 
loss in association with V AXZEVRIA. 
The search revealed 16 results, of which 8 relevant articles were discussed and presented in 
the review for Hearing loss below. 
Study articles identified for presentation during the reporting period 
(29 December 2021 to 28 June 2022): 
Pisani et al 2022 conducted, a systematic literature review of audio-vestibular events, such as 
sudden sensorineural hearing loss (SSNHL ), tinnitus, dizziness, and vertigo after COVID-1 9  
Vaccination. Objective was to evaluate the consistency of the reports, analyse their scientific 
value, express plausible supporting theories, and possibly identify a shared pathway for the 
management of the patients. Findings hypothesizes a possible autoimmune aetiology, 
according to the mechanism of cross-reaction. This hypothesis has been further corroborated 
by the collection of clinical data on patients. However, limitation of this thesis is the absence 
ofRT-PCR testing which could rule out COVID-1 9  infection in these patients. In fact, if not 
clearly excluded from a negative nasopharyngeal swab, there is a reasonable suspicion that 
symptoms are due to a new SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is known to be characterized by 
high neural tropism with potential damage to the inner ear, even in mild forms. 
AstraZeneca comment: There was no evidence of an increased risk of vaccination-related 
hearing loss, nor is there evidence of an association with V AXZEVRIA. There was lack of 
systematization and standardization in the collection of clinical information, as well as in 
patient management which makes it difficult to aggregate the cases and draw unambiguous 
conclusions.

•  Viral infection and vascular compromise eg, "viral infections and vascular 
compromise are the most accepted etio-pathogenic mechanisms" (Alcas O et al 2021 ,  
Y anir Y et al 2022, De Marco F et al 201 8, Tsetsos N et al 2021) eg, "viral infection, 
vascular ischemia, and autoimmune response are known suspicious causes of SNHL 
regardless of vaccination" (Jeong J et al 202 1). Since this mechanism has been 
established with the viral infection, there may be a possibility of such mechanism 
being attributed to the vaccine 
•  Auto-immunogenicity eg, "Both the mRNA payload and the lipid nanoparticle 
delivery vehicle have been suggested to be potential mechanisms of auto­
immunogenicity"; "A mechanism for COVID-1 9  vaccine-associated hearing loss 
could be an autoimmune process involving molecular mimicry related to the vaccine's 
antigen, or bystander activation of autoreactive T-cells that may involve the 
vestibulocochlear nerve (vestibular nerve is involved in balance and equilibrium 
functions, and cochlear nerve in hearing function)" (Formeister et al 2022) 
•  Biological mechanisms eg, "Reports of recovery of SARS-Co V-2 RNA in the middle 
ear of individuals who died of COVID-1 9  and recent findings of the ability of SARS­
Co V-2 to directly infect human vestibular hair and Schwann cells provide plausible 
biological mechanisms for COVID-1 9- associated hearing loss and may open avenues 
of investigation into immune mechanisms for COVID-1 9  vaccines in the inner ear' ' 
(Formeister et al 2022) 
•  Effect of synthesis of Immunoglobulin G eg, "SSNHL occurring 10 to 14 days after 
vaccination, could coincide with the production of lmmunoglobulin G at 10 to 14 
days after Covid-1 9  vaccine administration" (Wichova H et al 202 1) 
AstraZeneca comment: There is no confirmed mechanism of action for SNHL with 
V AXZEVRIA. However, potential mechanisms such as auto-immunogenicity, biological 
mechanisms with COVID-1 9  associated hearing loss, effect of synthesis of immunoglobulin 
and viral reactivation were proposed by the authors. 
Overall summary of all case reports 
Sudden hearing loss is known to occur naturally at an incidence that increases with age, and 
with a range of acquired and inherited risk factors involved (Lin RJ et al 2012). 
Of the 1719 hearing loss cases reported cumulatively through 28 June 2022, the TTO was 
within 28 days for 1 078 (62.7%) of the case reports that reported TTO. 28 1 out of 1719 cases 
were medically confirmed. Underlying cause/confounding factors were noted in 34.9% of 
medically confirmed cases. 
Cases were assessed by age, sex, type of event, and outcome. The characteristics of the 
events and of the individuals with events were as expected for the general population, 
including the observation of increased incidence in the elderly. No unusual trends or clusters 
were identified. None of the cases met WHO-UMC criteria for Certain or Probable/Likely. 
Of the 1719 cases, there were 2 fatal cases, of which 1  case was medically confirmed. These 
cases either had limited information on the or there were presence of confounders for the 
occurrence of the event and fatal outcome.

Review of medically confirmed reports did not raise any new relevant safety information for 
V AXZEVRIA. Most of the case reports (196 [69.8%]) were considered "Possible" related to 
V AXZEVRIA based on the suggestive TTO. 132 (47%) case reports also had presence of 
other risk factors/ confounders and 64 (22.8%) cases had limited information for a complete 
assessment. The 0/E analysis results showed observed cases of hearing loss to be 
significantly less than expected for all stratifications. 
From the review of literature, there is no confirmed mechanism, pathway or mediator 
identified for the occurrence of hearing loss in association with V AXZEVRIA. 
In summary, the review of available data from spontaneous reports regarding hearing loss did 
not identify an index case or other evidence of a new or emerging signal. 
Conclusion 
Based on the review of the currently available cumulative data, AstraZeneca considers that 
there is insufficient evidence to suggest a causal association between hearing loss and 
V AXZEVRIA. It is AstraZeneca's opinion that no changes to the CDS or RMP are warranted 
at this time. Hearing loss will continue to be monitored as part of AstraZeneca's routine 
surveillance activities for V AXZEVRIA. AstraZeneca will no longer discuss the topic future 
PBRERs, unless significant new safety information arises.

Booster dosing 
Request 
Following the last PBRER (DLP 28 December 2021), PRAC requested AstraZeneca to 
discuss any new information regarding Booster dosing in the next PSUR. The booster dose 
report in the previous PBRER had a DLP of 04 January 2022. 
AstraZeneca's response to this request is provided below. 
Review of Cases 
A search of the AstraZeneca global safety database (MedDRA version 25.0) was conducted 
to identify any adverse event (AE) reports involving confirmed Dose 3 or 'booster' dose of 
V AXZEVRIA received cumulatively through 28 June 2022. Adverse event (AE) reports 
involving confirmed booster was defined as any AE report for V AXZEVRIA where Dose 3 
was indicated in the Dose Text field in the AstraZeneca global safety database and where 
V AXZEVRIA was listed as a Suspect or Co-suspect medication. 
Cumulatively, through 28 June 2022, a total of 1 104 reports have been received of confirmed 
'booster' dosing involving V AXZEVRIA. Of the 1 104 reports received, 352 (3 1 .9%) were 
reported as serious and 472 (42.8%) were medically confirmed.

Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report 
COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOxl -S [recombinant]) 
AstraZeneca 
25 August 2022 
Compared to the previous booster analysis (DLP 04 January 2022), 495 new reports were 
received cumulatively till 28 June 2022. Most of the 495 new reports were from Brazil (206), 
Philippines (1 35) and Mexico (1 1 8), which co-relates with the booster dose administration in 
these countries in the PBRER reporting interval. 
One hundred and sixty one of the 1 104 cases, did not include other AEs apart from the 
medication error events (off-label use, overdose, medication error, drug exposure during 
pregnancy, Drug dose administration interval too long, Incorrect route of product 
administration, Inappropriate schedule of vaccine administered, Inappropriate dose of vaccine 
administered, Wrong vaccine administered, Drug dose administration interval too short, 
Incomplete course of vaccination, Vaccination failure, Inappropriate route of vaccination, 
Unevaluable event, and unexpected benefit). There was one case identified from the United 
States (US), however, V AXZEVRIA is not approved in the US. This case concerned a 
consumer from the US who read about a report of V AXZEVRIA and reported the AE to 
AstraZeneca. Information regarding the origin of the vaccinee who experienced the event of 
Intracranial pressure increased is unknown. 
Of these 1 104 cases, vaccinee gender was reported in 1 065 of the reports with 7 1 5  (64.8%) 
occurring in females and 350 (3 1 .70%) occurring in males and gender was unknown in 39 
(3.5%) cases. Vaccinee age was available in 818 of the reports and ranged from 4 to 97 years 
of age with a median of 46 years. 
A total of 3741 AEs were reported within the  1 104 reports of booster dosing with 
V AXZEVRIA through 28 June 2022. Of these 3741 AEs, 1228 (32.8%) were reported as 
serious due to the AE being considered as medially important (974, [79.3%]), the AE was 
reported to have resulted in disability (241  [ 19.6]), required hospitalization (262 [ 19.8]), was 
life threatening (85  [6.9]), and/or resulted in death (40 [3.3]). Cases may have met more than 
one criteria for seriousness. Cases may have met more than one criteria for seriousness. 
Outcome was reported for 1 93 1  of the 3741 AEs reported, as follows: Not recovered (730, 
37.8%), Recovered (778, 40.2%), Recovering (339,  1 7.6%), Recovered with sequelae (44, 
2.3%), and Death (40, 2.1 %). 
A distribution of the AEs reported with a frequency > 1 0  is provided in Table 37. The most 
frequently reported AEs with V AXZEVRIA booster were listed AEs as per V AXZEVRIA 
CDS, such as Headache, Pyrexia, Fatigue, myalgia, asthenia, chills, arthralgia, nausea, 
dizziness etc. in terms of most frequently reported events, No usual trends or clusters were 
identified compared to the previously PBRER.

and pain occurred on the day of the third dose of 
vaccination while cardiac arrest occurred a day 
after. The patient died on an unspecified date. Due 
to limited information on the exact circumstances

Underlying past medical history of Diabetes 
mellitus and age could be considered as risk 
factors for the event. The cause of death was 
reported as ischaemic stroke. Due to limited

pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, 
coagulopathies, trauma, cancer, obesity, smoking, 
immobility), the evaluation did not find evidence 
to suggest a causal relationship between the fatal 
event and V AXZEVRIA.

In general, the review of fatal cases demonstrated insufficient case details or the presence of 
confounders / risk factors for the reported fatal AEs, and there is currently insufficient 
evidence to suggest a reasonable possibility of a causal relationship between V AXZEVRIA 
and the fatal AEs. 
Unlisted Adverse Events (AEs) 
Of the total 3741 AEs reported with V AXZEVRIA booster through 28 June 2022, 1531 
(40.9%) AEs unlisted as per the Company Core Data Sheet (CDS) version 17.0. Of the 153 1 
unlisted AEs, 669 (43.7%) unlisted AEs were serious, of which 494 (73.8%) were considered 
medically important by the reporter, 149 (22.3%) reportedly required hospitalization, 137 
(20.5%) were reported to have resulted in disability, 55 (8%) were reported as life­
threatening and 40 ( 6%) reportedly resulted in death. Cases may have met more than one 
criteria for seriousness. Of the 153 1 unlisted AEs, 862 (56.3%) were nonserious. 
Of the 153 1 unlisted AEs, the outcomes have been reported as: Unknown (729 [47.6%]), Not 
recovered (366 [23.9%]), Recovered (227 [ 14.8%]), Recovering (146 [9.5%]), Recovered 
with sequelae (23 [1 .5%]), and patient died (40 [2.6%]). Of the 767 cases with unlisted AEs, 
265 (34.6%) were medically confirmed.

paraesthesia and hypoaesthesia are now considered ADRs with V AXZEVRIA and, hence, no 
longer included as AESis. Of the 122 unlisted AESis, 98 (80.3%) AESis were serious, of 
which 65 (53.3%) were considered medically important by the reporter, 40 (26.9%)

reportedly required hospitalization, 24 (19.7%) were reported to have resulted in disability, 
2 1  (17.2%) were reported as life threatening by the reporter and 3 (2.5%) reportedly resulted 
in death. Cases may have met more than one criteria for seriousness. Of the 122 unlisted 
AESis, outcome was reported, as follows: Not recovered (5 1  [41 .8%]), Unknown (27 
[22.3%]), Recovering (20 [16.4%]), Recovered (17 [13.9%]), Recovered with sequelae (4 
[3.3%]), and patient died (3 [2.5%]). 
Of the 122 unlisted AESis identified cumulatively till 28 June 2022, 46 involved patients 
with confirmed heterologous dosing regimen, 49 involved homologous dosing regimen, and 
27 involved an unknown dosing regimen. The overall distribution of the reported unlisted 
AES Is for all V AXZEVRIA booster is provided in Table 4 7.

In comparison to the previous PBRER DLP 28 December 2021 ,  the increase in types and 
number of AESis aligned with the increase in overall AEs and did not indicate any new 
safety concerns. 
In general, the medically confirmed unlisted AESI cases demonstrated insufficient case 
details or confounders / risk factors for the reported AESis and was therefore not possible to 
confirm causality or are unlikely to be related to V AXZEVRIA. 
Summary 
Overall, the most frequently reported AEs with V AXZEVRIA booster use are consistent with 
the known safety profile of the vaccine, with the majority of AEs being non-serious (68. 1  %). 
The majority of unlisted AE profiling was also non-serious (56.3%), and the most frequently 
reported unlisted PT was "off-label use" (95) which mostly involved vaccinees receiving 3rd

dose of V AXZEVRIA in countries where use of the vaccine as a booster has or had not yet 
been approved, and the PT "Adverse event" (70), which refer to unspecified AEs. On review 
of unlisted clinical AEs, no abnormal trend was identified cumulative till 28 June 2022, and 
in general the cases were poorly documented which is further confirmed by the fact that only 
34.6% of all unlisted cases were medically confirmed overall, and additionally only 1 5% of 
serious unlisted cases were medically confirmed. Although the majority of unlisted AESis 
were serious, there were relatively few unlisted AESis reported (7.9%), and medically 
confirmed (2 1 .3%). No trends for AESis were identified when compared with the AESis 
reported with primary vaccination. 
A review of booster reports involving homologous and heterologous dosing with 
V AXZEVRIA within the vaccination regimen did not identify any new safety concerns. The 
nature and severity of adverse events reported with homologous or heterologous dosing did 
not differ from the currently known safety profile of V AXZEVRIA. 
It is AstraZeneca's opinion that no changes to the CDS or the Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
are warranted at this time. AstraZeneca will continue to monitor adverse event reports 
involving booster dosing with V AXZEVRIA as part of ongoing routine surveillance 
activities. 
15.2.4  Menstrual Disorder 
Background 
In the assessment report received from the PRAC EMA (PRAC PAR 
(EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/000109 12/202 1 12) for the V AXZEVRIA PBRER (review period 
29 June 202 1 to 28 December 202 1), further information on the topic of Menstrual disorder is 
requested as follows from AstraZeneca: 
The MAH is requested to present an in-depth evaluation of all available data and recently 
published literature,  including a discussion on possible mechanism should also be provided. 
The MAH is requested to present a refined review of cases of rechallenge. 
AstraZeneca's response to these requests are provided in the subsections below. 
Global Patient Safety Database 
A cumulative search till 28 June 2022 of the AstraZeneca Global Safety Database for 
Menstrual disorder with V AXZEVRIA was performed using MedDRA version 25.0. The 
search was conducted at the level ofMedDRA HLTs: Menstruation and uterine bleeding 
NEC, Menstruation with decreased bleeding, Menstruation with increased bleeding; and 
MedDRA PTs: vaginal haemorrhage, uterine haemorrhage, and postmenopausal 
haemorrhage. The search retrieved a total of20994 case reports with 27145 events of 
Menstrual disorders. Cumulatively, a total 2 148 cases (10.2%) were reported in women over 
50 years of age.

4. 1 %), Spain (583, 2.8%) and Brazil (464, 2.2%). 
The following observations were made from a review of the 20994 case reports pertaining to 
Menstrual disorder: 
•  Vaccinee  age  was  reported  in  1 8029  case  reports  and  ranged  O  to  94  years  (median: 
41 years).  Five  cases  were  reported  with  age  O  years  however  based  on  the  reported 
information they were adult vaccinees and all were received via regulatory source (3  from 
UK,  1 each from Germany and Netherlands). 
•  Vaccinee gender was reported in 20328 case reports.  In 67 (0.3%) out of the 20328 case 
reports, gender was reported as male. A total 37 of the 67 cases were considered as event 
coding errors upon further review ofreported term and narrative. In remaining 30 of the 67, 
the  gender was reported as male,  however based on the  reported information,  they were 
female vaccinees. Of these 67, 64 reports were received via regulatory authority. 
•  A total of 1323 (6.3%) case reports were medically confirmed and 19671 (93.7%) were non­
medically confirmed. 
•  A total of 1 97 vaccinees were pregnant at the time of reporting of menstrual disorder event; 
and 80 vaccinees had co-reported event of abortion.

Co-reported AEs 
In 10,382 (49.5%) case reports, the menstrual disorder event was reported without any co­
reported AEs. In the remaining cases there were 34034 co-reported AEs along with menstrual 
disorder events. The events most commonly co-reported with Menstrual disorders are 
presented in Table 55. The most co-reported AEs were systemic AEs such as, headache, 
fatigue, pyrexia, chills, nausea, and myalgia.  Some notable frequently co-reported ADRs are 
menstruation symptoms such as breast complaints (breast pain (149), breast swelling (27), 
breast tenderness (47), breast discomfort ( 1 0)), mood swings (7 1 ), depressed mood (95) and 
hot flushes (1 68). The latter can be related to menopause as well.

A total of 5356 (20% out of27145 events) other menstrual disorder events were reported and 
most of them (92%) were consumer reports,  see Table 60. Similar to overall menstrual 
disorders combined, the age group of 35-44 was the largest group (30%) followed by 45-54 
(23%) and 25-34 (21 %) years. Most frequently reported Med.ORA PTs was Menstrual 
disorder (3238), Vaginal haemorrhage (1 880), Uterine haemorrhage (103), 
Menometrorrhagia (76), and Anovulatory cycle (33). Most of the events (42%) had not 
recovered at the time ofreporting, however 41 % were resolved/resolving/resolved with 
sequalae. Out of 793 events with a known duration, 582 (73.4%) had resolved within  14 days 
of onset. A total 1 3  9 of the women with other menstrual disorder events had history of 
pregnancy, 66 were pregnant at the time of vaccination or after vaccination, 57 women had 
history of breast feeding, 38, 27 and 24 women had history of endometriosis, menopause and 
polycystic ovaries respectively.

25 August 2022 
Anecdotal reports of the COVID-1 9  vaccines altering women's menstrual cycle have been 
circulating on the internet since the beginning of 202 1 .  Menstrual disorder case reports were 
compared based on the case onset date and AstraZeneca initial receipt date. Figure 1  shows 
clear peaks for reports received date at times when menstrual disorders were discussed in the 
media (June/July 2021 to August 2021 and September/October 2021 ). However, the start 
dates of the menstrual disorder events shows no obvious peaks and seems to correlate with 
the vaccination program. 
Figure 1 
Peaks of reports received at times when Menstrual Disorders were 
discussed in media 
The outcome based on the Menstrual disorder categories has been presented in Table 6 1 .  A 
total of 10012 events (37%) out of 27145, had resolved/resolved with sequelae/resolving. 
Overall, most women had not recovered at time of reporting (12974 events [48%]). However, 
in the medically confirmed reports 46% of the events were resolved/resolved with 
sequalae/resolving at the time of reporting.

•  Amongst 6546 events with reported outcome 'recovered' or 'recovered with sequelae,' the 
event duration was reported in 3559 [54%]  events. The median duration of events 7 days 
(0-464 days), while 2032 (57%) had resolved within 8 days of onset. 
Events with fatal outcome 
Of the 27145 events of Menstrual disorder reported, 2 events (0.01 %) in 2 cases were 
reported with fatal outcome cumulatively through DLP 28 June 2022, and both were 
consumer reports. 
: A 4 7 years old vaccinee with a medical history of asthma received 
V AXZEVRIA on an unknown date. At an unspecified time after vaccination, the vaccinee 
experienced pulmonary embolism which had a fatal outcome. Menstrual disorder was 
reported with no time to onset and with limited information. 
AstraZeneca Comment: This report lacks information on the nature of the menstrual 
disorder, patient medical history including menstrual history, contraceptives or intrauterine 
devices used, platelet count, smoking, immobilisation and baseline health condition before 
the vaccination, etiological, diagnostic work up (clotting factors, coagulation panel, CT­
angiogram, chest x-ray and CT-scan, full gynaecologic work up) and autopsy report. Death 
was attributed to pulmonary embolism and the TTO is not provided. 
Female vaccinee of 41 years of age with a history of diabetes who had being 
vaccinated with V AXZEVRIA in February 2022. On 1 1  March 2022, approximately a month 
after receiving V AXZEVRIA, the patient experienced intermenstrual bleeding reported as 
spotting for one month, subsequently followed by blood clots in an unspecified site and died. 
The patient's previous history of any blood disorders is unknown. The other reported events 
included fatigue and abdominal pain. The cause of death was intermenstrual bleeding and 
thrombosis.

Female vaccinee of 41 years of age with a history of diabetes who had being 
vaccinated with V AXZEVRIA in February 2022. On 1 1  March 2022, approximately a month 
after receiving V AXZEVRIA, the patient experienced intermenstrual bleeding reported as

The patient's previous history of any blood disorders is unknown. The other reported events 
included fatigue and abdominal pain. The cause of death was intermenstrual bleeding and 
thrombosis. 
AstraZeneca Comment: There is limited information about the vaccinee's medical history 
including menstrual history, use of hormonal preparations such as contraceptives, smoking, 
baseline health status site of thrombosis, platelet count, anti-PF 4, contraceptives, which 
precludes performing a complete assessment. 
Rechallenge / Recurrence case reports 
Cumulatively, 1 (0.005%) out of20994 case reports of menstrual disorder had a rechallenge, 
the patient experienced abnormal uterine bleeding after the first dose, and a recurrence of 
abnormal uterine bleeding with the second dose of vaccination indicating potential 
recurrence/rechallenge. This case report was a medically confirmed report from regulatory 
source. 
concerns a 45-year-old female of unknown ethnicity who 
The report ( case 
experienced an unspecified abnormal uterine bleeding, 2 days after receiving first dose of 
V AXZEVRIA. The report described the re-administration of V AXZEVRIA (possibly dose 2) 
on an unknown date and the event of abnormal (unspecified) uterine bleeding recurred. There 
was no information on time to onset for the re-occurrence. At the time of reporting, the event 
was said to be ongoing. 
AstraZeneca comment: In this report, there is limited information on the nature of the 
abnormal uterine bleeding for both episodes, patient medical history including menstrual 
history, gynaecologic disorders such as uterine fibroids or polyps, concomitant medications 
such as hormonal contraception, intrauterine devices, physical or mental stress, etiologic and 
diagnostic examination including gynaecological assessment. Also, there is no information on 
the dose timing in regards to the vaccinee's menstrual cycle, and the time interval between 2 
doses and whether the in-between menstrual cycles were normal. This lacking information 
precludes performing a complete causal assessment.

On using the above search criteria, 32 articles were identified. Of these, 7 articles were 
considered relevant for further discussion. All the seven articles reported multiple COVID-1 9  
vaccines. 
Von Woon et al 2022 conducted a prospective observational study to determine whether 
COVID-1 9  vaccination affects menstrual bleeding. Study included 79 menstruating women 
who logged at least three consecutive cycles, during which time they each received at least 
one dose of COVID-1 9  vaccine which included Pfizer (65 [82.3%]), Modema (1 1  [14%]) and 
AstraZeneca (3 [3.8%]). 
A dose of the COVID-1 9  vaccine was associated with a delay to start of menstruation in the 
subsequent period in spontaneously cycling participants (2.3 days after dose 1 ;  1 .3 days after 
dose 2). Periods in inter-dose cycles and post-vaccination cycles occurred with a mean of0.3 
days late and 0.47 days early, respectively; these values were not significantly different from 
the pre-vaccination average. No change to timing was detected in those on hormonal 
contraception. No significant change was noted in self-reported menstrual flow in the period 
or withdrawal bleed following vaccination, either in spontaneously cycling participants, or in 
those taking hormonal contraception. Also, authors detected no association between 
menstrual changes and other commonly reported side effects of vaccination, such as sore 
arm, fever, and fatigue. 
AstraZeneca comment: This was a prospective study design and therefore reduces selection 
bias. However, the cohort of subjects was small (79 patients), and very few patients received 
the V AXZEVRIA vaccine (3 [3.8%]). There was a delay in start of menstruation reported in 
spontaneously cycling participants, however this delay rapidly reversed. No change was 
noted in self-reported menstrual flow in the period or withdrawal bleed or no association 
between menstrual changes and other commonly reported side effects of vaccination. 
Lagana et al 2022 evaluated menstrual irregularities after the first and second doses of the 
COVID-1 9  vaccine in Italy. A survey was available only in Italian language for 30 days 
(10 September 202 1 to 10 October 2021) and distributed by social media, Linkedln, 
Facebook and Twitter. The results of the study have been presented in Table 62 below.

Overall conclusion as per author: Approximately 50% to 60% of reproductive-age women 
who received the first dose of the COVID-1 9  vaccine reported menstrual cycle irregularities, 
regardless of the type of administered vaccine. The occurrence of menstrual irregularities 
seems to be slightly higher ( 60% to 70%) after the second dose. Menstrual irregularities after 
both the first and second doses of the vaccine were found to self-resolve in approximately 
half the cases within 2 months. 
AstraZeneca comment: Although in order to limit confounders, women with gynaecological 
and non-gynaecological diseases, undergoing hormonal and non-hormonal treatments, in 
perimenopause or menopause, as well as who had irregular menstrual cycle in the last 
12 months before vaccine administration were excluded, recall bias is a significant limitation. 
Also, from the methodological point of view, there is no control group, so the report is aimed 
only to offer a description of what was observed, without any possibility to infer cause-effect. 
Therefore, the information from the study is too limited to confirm causality. 
The next two articles have published results of self-reported cross-sectional studies. 
Baena-Garcia et al 2022 used retrospective online survey to describe the prevalence of 
perceived premenstrual and menstrual changes after COVID-1 9  vaccine administration in 
Spain from June to September 202 1 .  A total of 14153 women (mean age 3 1 .5 ± 9.3 years old) 
who had received the full course of vaccination at least three months earlier were included in 
this cross-sectional study. The most predominant menstrual changes were more menstrual 
bleeding (43%), more menstrual pain (41 %), delayed menstruation (38%), fewer days of 
menstrual bleeding (34.5%), and shorter cycle length (32%). The study concluded that 
women vaccinated against COVID-1 9  usually perceive mild menstrual and premenstrual 
changes and future studies are warranted to clarify the physiological mechanisms behind 
these widely reported changes. 
Muhaidat et al 2022 investigated the prevalence and impact of menstrual abnormalities after 
the COVID-1 9  vaccination among females residing within the Middle East and North Africa 
in a cross-sectional online self-administered survey during July and August 202 1 .  A total of 
2269 females were included in the study, with a mean age of 34.3 ± 8.5 years and 66.3% 
reported having menstrual symptoms post-vaccination, thereof 46.7% after the first dose. 
They majority of the participants received COMIRNATY (48.4%), SINOPHARM (35.3%) 
and V AXZEVRIA (13.4%). Vaccine type did not significantly influence the incidence of 
abnormalities (p < 0.05). Among the participants, 75. 1 % had regular menstrual cycles before 
taking the vaccine for the last year, and 24.9% had irregular menstrual cycles. About a third 
(29.7%) of the participants were smokers, and 6.7% had a history of coagulation disorders 
(including bleeding, blood clots, thrombocytopenia, or taking coagulation medication). 
Among patients who complained of post-vaccination menstrual abnormalities, 77 .6% had no 
previous COVID-1 9  infection. When comparing menstrual abnormalities among those with a 
previous history of infection and those without a history of infection there was no significant 
associations with post-vaccination menstrual abnormalities (p = 0. 136); it was found that 
66.8% had menstrual abnormalities among those who did not have previous COVID-1 9  
infection or symptoms suspected of COVID-1 9  infection and did not test. Similarly, 67 .5% of

those with confirmed previous COVID-1 9  infection had menstrual abnormalities. The post­
vaccination menstrual abnormalities were significantly associated with the severity of 
previous COVID-1 9  infection (p = 0.006). The author's concluded that the study showed a 
possible link between the COVID-1 9  vaccine and menstrual abnormalities that have impacted 
vaccinees' quality of life 
AstraZeneca comment: The cross-sectional design of these two studies limits the ability to 
determine causal relationships. In addition, self-reported data extraction has an increased 
likelihood of recall bias or self-selection as those with menstrual disorders might be more 
interested in participating in the study. The use of an internet-based survey might have 
underrepresented or overrepresented certain target groups, especially older populations with 
limited internet access or technological awareness. Therefore, the information from these two 
studies is too limited to assess causality. 
Rogers et al 2022 reported on the incidence of adverse events (AEs), reactogenicity 
symptoms, menstrual changes and overall self-rated improvement in health and well-being 
after COVID-1 9  vaccination. Participants had registered through the study website 
(V AC4COVID Study 2022), 16 265 had consented to participate in the study. Overall rates of 
women aged 1 8-59 reporting menstrual symptoms in the  12 weeks after vaccination were 
low (0.3%). Unadjusted percentages ofreporting menstrual symptoms, including menstrual 
cycle alteration or intermenstrual bleeding (12 events), heavy bleeding (1 1) or painful 
periods/cramping (5) within 12 weeks of vaccination were higher after COMIRNATY 
vaccinations (0.6% after first dose, 0.4% after second dose) than after ChAdOxl  (0.2% after 
first dose, 0.2% after second dose). However, there was no difference between vaccines after 
adjusting for age in a proportional hazards model and overall cumulative rates were low. 
Participants reported these events as 25% mild, 54% moderate and 2 1  % severe; none resulted 
in hospitalisation. The study provides reassuring data on low rates of AEs after COVID-1 9  
vaccination. 
Nazir et al 2022 conducted a literature review using digital databases to systematically 
identify the studies reporting any menstrual abnormalities after the COVID-1 9  vaccine. A 
total of78,1 3 8  vaccinated females were included in this review from 14 studies. Of these, 
39,759 (52.05%) had some form of a menstrual problem after vaccination. Menorrhagia, 
metrorrhagia, and polymenorrhea were the most observed problems and the overall study­
level rate of menstrual abnormality ranged from 0.83% to 90.9%. Age, history of pregnancy, 
systemic side-effects of COVID-1 9, smoking, and second dose of COVID-1 9  vaccine were 
predictors of menstrual problems after vaccination. Most of the cross-sectional studies 
reported in literature were unable to report causal relationship between menstrual 
irregularities and COVID-1 9  vaccination status. The studies reported were mainly 
questionnaire based cross-sectional studies and a causal relationship of the predictors with 
post vaccination menstrual irregularities requires further validation. The review concluded 
that further prospective cohort studies are needed to identify the temporal link: between 
menstrual cycle changes.

AstraZeneca comment: The aetiologies of menstrual disorders are muhifactorial and there 
could be an interplay of these factors in cases. AstraZeneca has not identified any increase in 
menstrual disorders with second dose. 
Wang et al 2022 reported the associations of SARS-Co V-2 infection and COVID-1 9  
vaccination with menstrual cycle characteristics. This was against the background of 
increasing public questions and mistrust about the potential adverse reproductive impacts of 
COVID-1 9  infection and vaccination. The study involved prospectively following 3858 pre­
menopausal women in the Nurses' Health Study 3 (NHS3) living in the United States or 
Canada. In this analysis, participants who reported receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine (n=9) 
and participants who did not report vaccine type (n=6) were excluded. Logistic or 
multinomial logistic regression models were used to assess the associations between ( 1) 
SARS-CoV-2 infection and (2) COVID-1 9  vaccination and change in menstrual cycle 
characteristics. Authors concluded that COVID-1 9  vaccination may be associated with short­
term changes in usual menstrual cycle length, particularly among women whose cycles were 
short, long or irregular before vaccination. These results underscore the importance of 
monitoring menstrual health in vaccine clinical trials. Future work should examine the 
potential biological mechanisms. 
AstraZeneca comment: The study did not include V AXZEVRIA. The study population 
being healthcare workers with a high vaccination rate may limit generalizability to 
populations with a different pandemic experience including those who got access to 
vaccination later during the pandemic. However, the fact that there is some historical data 
from the participants allowed for comparison of pre and post vaccination menstrual cycle 
data and compare uninfected and unvaccinated. AstraZeneca will continue to closely monitor 
the topic of menstrual disorders. 
Summary 
Overall medical summary of all case reports 
Menstrual disorders are very common and have high incidence rates regardless of 
vaccination; and stress (physical or psychological) is a common aetiology. There are 20994 
reports of menstrual disorder reported globally for V AXZEVRIA. The number of reports is 
relatively low compared to both the number of people vaccinated (see 5.2. 1 .2) and the 
prevalence of menstrual disorders generally (Kwak et al 201 9). The TTO median was 8 days 
and most of the reports (76%) were reported within 28 days post vaccination. Most of events 
(54.6%) were reported in menopausal age group (35-44 (3 1 .5%) and 25-34 (23. 1  %)) and 45-
54 (22.1%). 
The most reported menstrual disorders were heavy menstrual blood loss, followed by 
amenorrhoea/oligomenorrhoea and other menstrual disorders. Menstrual disorders can be 
very diverse and different per individual. Although the reported menstrual events were 
categorised in 9 categories, many of the reports contained multiple menstrual events and fell 
into multiple categories.

The most frequent co-reported AEs were known systemic and local reactions. These are very 
common reactions and were to be expected. Other reactions that were frequently co-reported 
were reactions related to the menstrual cycle, such as breast changes and mood swings. 
A total 48% of menstrual disorder events had not resolved at the time ofreporting. It is 
possible that, women reported their complaints before they fully recovered which is 
understandable since menstrual disorders such as amenorrhoea and irregular menstrual cycle 
generally can take a longer time to recover. 
Due to insufficient information available in these reports, these findings do not provide more 
insight on the possible relationship between V AXZEVRIA and menstrual disorders. In 
summary, the review of available data from spontaneous reports regarding menstrual 
disorders did not identify an index case or other evidence of a new or emerging signal. 
Literature summary 
As pointed out in Von Woon et al 2022, Lagana et al 2022, Muhaidat et al 2022 articles 
there seems to be an association between COVID-1 9  vaccination (regardless of type) and 
menstrual disorders. The conclusion by Wang et al 2022 that is no link between menstrual 
disorders and COVID-1 9  infection but rather vaccination is plausible giving that both mRNA 
and adenovirus-vectored vaccines were both associated with menstrual change. Many of the 
literature available recommended future work to examine the potential biological 
mechanisms that may explain an association between COVID-1 9  vaccination and menstrual 
disorders. The design of most studies reviewed did not consider control groups, hence it is 
impossible to make causal inferences from them. The actual incidence rate of menstrual 
disorders with COVID-1 9  vaccination is still unclear due to problems of overestimating, 
underestimating and biases. However, there seem to be more calls for studies designed 
particularly to aid the determination of causal inference and also confirm biologic 
mechanisms that will adequately explain the effects of COVID vaccination on menstrual 
disorders. 
Conclusion 
Based on the review of the updated cumulative data, AstraZeneca considers that there is 
insufficient evidence to suggest a causal association between menstrual disorders and 
V AXZEVRIA. It is AstraZeneca's opinion that no changes to the CDS or RMP are warranted 
at this time. AstraZeneca will closely monitor safety information for Menstrual disorders as 
part of the ongoing safety surveillance activities for V AXZEVRIA. 
15.2.5  Myocarditis 
BACKGROUND 
AstraZeneca received the following request in PRAC PSUR assessment report (review 
period: 29 June 2021 to 28 December 2021 ): In the next PBRER, AstraZeneca is requested to 
provide the following discussion for myocarditis:

A review of newly identified and cumulative cases; 
A causality assessment ofmyocarditis cases (not provided in the current review); 
A review of the literature for new publications on epidemiologic studies of interest 
and mechanistic discussions; 
A discussion on new evidence on an association between myocarditis and 
VAXZEVRIA 
AstraZeneca's responses to these requests are provided in subsections 15.2.6 below. 
The BCC case definition (Myocarditis/Pericarditis Case Definition 2021) was used for the 
review of the data available in the case reports. Furthermore, causality assessment according 
to WHO-UMC criteria was completed for Myocarditis cases fulfilling BCC Level  1 ,  2 or 3. 
AstraZeneca also conducted an observed versus expected analysis for Myocarditis using the 
cumulative observed number of cases and risk window of 2-42 days. Background incidence 
rates from Truven Marketscan (2019) have been used for 0/E analyses. Background rates 
include hospitalized and non-hospitalized cases of myocarditis. 
Global Patient Safety Database 
A cumulative search (29 December 2020 to 28 June 2022) and periodic search 
(29 December 202 1 to 28 June 2022) of the AstraZeneca Global Patient Safety Database for 
Myocarditis with V AXZEVRIA was performed for case reports from all sources (clinical, 
spontaneous, solicited reporting and literature) using MedDRA (version 25.0). The search 
strategy included the following MedDRA PTs: Myocarditis; Autoimmune myocarditis; 
Eosinophilic myocarditis; Giant cell myocarditis; Hypersensitivity myocarditis; Immune­
mediated myocarditis; Lupus myocarditis, Myocarditis post infection; Chronic myocarditis; 
and Myopericarditis. 
During the reporting interval (29 December 2021 to 28 June 2022), there were 266 case 
reports (2 14 initial reports [13 1 cases concerning Dose 1 ,  52 cases concerning Dose 2, 4 
cases concerning dose 3 and in 27 cases dose information were unknown] and 52 follow-up 
reports [3 7 concerning Dose 1 ,  9 concerning Dose 2 and in 6 cases dose information were 
unknown]). Further analysis in this report is focused on the cumulative data. 
Cumulative review through DLP 28 June 2022 
The search retrieved a total of 763 events ofMyocarditis from 761 case reports. Two cases 
reported with two PTs ofMyocarditis (Myocarditis and Myopericarditis). 
A split of myocarditis cases by seriousness and source is presented in Table 63.

Brighton Collaboration Classification (BCC) Assessment and Causality assessment as 
per WHO-UMC criteria 
The Brighton collaboration of the myocarditis case definition criteria 
(M yocarditis/Pericarditis Case Definition 2021) were used for the review of the data available 
in the case reports. Based on this approach, out of the 761 case reports,  12 (1 .6%) fulfilled 
level 1 criteria, 52 (6.8%) fulfilled level 2 criteria, none fulfilled level 3 criteria, 390 (5 1 .2%) 
fulfilled level 4 criteria, and 307 (40.3%) case reports fulfilled level 5 criteria. Causality 
assessment for cases fulfilling BCC 1 to 3 were performed using WHO-UMC causality

However, the presence of leukocytosis with

highly suspicious of ongoing infectious process. 
Also, COVID  19 infection was not ruled out. 
The lack of information regarding the family 
history; laboratory work up and other possible 
differentials that could have been ruled out in 
this article; make it difficult to ascertain causal 
association of myopericarditis with pleuritis

Of the total 761 case reports, 390 (5 1 .2%) fulfilled BCC Level 4 criteria. These case reports 
did not fulfil criteria for certainty levels  1 ,  2 and 3, as there was insufficient information to 
confirm the diagnosis or medical assessment of the case. 
Brighton Collaboration Classification Level 5 
A total of 307 (40.3%) of the 761 case reports ofMyocarditis fulfilled BCC Level 5 criteria 
(ie, Myocarditis excluded due to an alternative diagnosis, hence a not a case ofMyocarditis).

either time to onset, medical history/co-morbidities, concomitant medication details, and 
clinical course for a comprehensive causal assessment. 
Overall, the review for case reports of Myocarditis did not raise any new relevant safety 
information for V AXZEVRIA. 
Observed Versus Expected (0/E) Analyses 
An O/E analysis ofMyocarditis was conducted cumulatively through 28 June 2022 and 
presented in Table 72. The results are stratified by risk windows (7 days,  14 days, 2 1  days, 
and 42 days) age group (1 8--49 years, 50--59 years, 60--69 years, � 70 years), gender and with 
dose (Dose 1 and Dose 2 for regions EEA, UK, Australia, Canada, Philippines, Argentina, 
Malaysia, New Zealand, Colombia, Taiwan, Brazil, and Thailand). 
Background incidence rates from Truven Marketscan (201 9) have been used for O/E 
analyses. 
Conservatively, the exposure for global reports (448306152) is based on doses administered 
in 1 3  markets as explained in Appendix 8.

The observed versus expected analysis for all reported cases of myocarditis with 
stratifications by risk windows age group, gender and dose suggested that observed cases 
occurred less frequently than expected, except for age group 1 8-29 in UK males with risk 
window 7 and  14 days (where observed cases were more than expected without being 
statistically significant). However, when a qualitative review was conducted for 5 case 
reports from 1 8-29 years age UK males with risk window 7 and 14 days, 1 case had met the 
BCC level 2 with WHO-UMC causality as possible; however there were limited information 
on medical history, concomitant medications precluding a proper assessment to determine 
causal relationship. The remaining 4 case reports were BCC 4/5, as there was insufficient 
information to confirm the diagnosis or medical assessment of the case. The O/E analysis 
does not take account of potential confounders for the event, which could provide an 
alternative explanation.

Cardiovascular and

19 vaccination: A 
systematic review 
Type of study / Objectives / Results 
AstraZeneca assessment 
Study type 
Systematic review 
Objective 
Putting together all the reported cardiovascular and haematological 
events post COVID-19 vaccination in published literature and to 
suggest possible mechanisms to explain these rare phenomena 
Results 
A total of 50 CI events were reported after receiving Pfizer vaccine 
(32 myocarditis, 3 myocardial infarction (MI),  1 1  myopericarditis and 
4 others, including 2 pericarditis, 1 acute coronary syndrome (ACS) 
and 1  stress cardiomyopathy). Twenty-five cases of cardiac events 
were detected in individuals post Modema vaccination 
(24 myocarditis and 1 MI). Seventy-four cardiac events were reported 
in individuals who received the AstraZeneca vaccine (23 Ml, 46 
ischemic heart disease and 5 others, including 1 heart strain, 1 cardiac 
arrest and 3 ACS). These results revealed that more myocarditis and 
myopericarditis events were reported after the mRNA vaccines, Pfizer  • 
and Modema, while more MI and ischemic heart disease were mainly 
reported following the V AXZEVRIA vaccination. 
Overall conclusion as per author 
The frequency of cardiovascular events in general was higher 
following the V AXZEVRIA, but more myocarditis and pericarditis 
cases were reported following mRNA vaccines. Some of the attributes 
to the use of vaccines may not be true as mechanisms supports more 
of anaphylactic reaction 
Key findings and strength 
Although cardiac injury, hypertension, hemorrhage, thrombosis and 
thrombocytopenia were reported as adverse events, reported that the 
benefits of vaccination outweigh the potential risks 
Weakness 
Bias in terms of publishing report (Not the same doses were given in all 
vaccines reported, as such it is difficult to compare against each other in 
terms of prevalence) 
(Another limitation was the lack of evidence that any of the reported 
events were associated with or induced by the vaccines) 
• 
93 out of the 99 included studies were case reports/case series (many 
limitations: inability to assess causality particularly in incidental 
events, lack of generalisability, no denominator data, no comparison 
group, lack of information on known confounders, high risk of 
residual confounding, high risk of misclassification, publication bias, 
etc.) 
Age not reported in approx. half the cases who received AZ vaccine, 
limiting inferences about age-specific risk 
Conclusion 
Almost all of the studies included in this review were case reports/case 
series with the above-mentioned limitations including potential 
confounding by recognized risk factors such as comorbidities, etc., which 
were not taken in to consideration. Thus, available information is 
insufficient to suggest a causal relationship between V AXZEVRIA and 
cardiovascular events,.

Development of 
myocarditis and 
pericarditis after 
COVID-19 
vaccination in adult 
population: A 
systematic review. 
Systematic review 
Objective 
The aim of this systematic review is to explore the incidence, clinical 
presentation, management, and association between myocarditis and 
pericarditis after covid-19 vaccination. 
Results 
Out of the 97, most of the patients received Pfizer-BioNTech (n = 67, 
69%) and rest of the patients received 25 (25.7%) Moderna (n = 67, 
69%), Janssen Johnson & Johnson (n = 4, 4. 1 %) and AstraZeneca 
(n = 1, 1.03%). A total of79 (81 .4%) patients developed acute 
myocarditis, 9 (9.2%) myopericarditis or perimyocarditis, 3 (3%) 
acute pericarditis, 4 (4.1 %) fulminant myocarditis, 1 (1 .03%) each 
with fulminant pericarditis and lymphohistiocytic myocarditis. 
Overall conclusion as per author 
Myocarditis and pericarditis after the COVID-19 vaccine occur most 
commonly in adult males after the second dose of mRNA vaccines 
(Pfizer and Moderna) especially after the second dose. Viral vector 
vaccines may be a better alternative for patients with a history of 
cardiac diseases. 
Key findings and strength 
5 cohort studies with relatively large sample sizes (15,585,309 
participants) and describing Covid-19 vaccine -associated myocarditis/ 
pericarditis with mean onset of symptoms after vaccine administration of 
3.8 ± 4.5 days and 75% of 97 reported cases developing symptoms after 
the second dose 
Weakness 
Although, quality assessment of included studies (methodological 
strength) was performed. However, the results of this assessment was not 
presented in main text/discussion. 
According to the author, "the main limitation of this review is that no 
large-scale ( only from 2 countries; USA and Israel) clinical trial 
investigating the risk factors, clinical presentation, and prognosis of 
patients developing myocarditis and pericarditis following COVID-19 
vaccination has been conducted so far so only case reports, case series, 
and cohort studies have been included in the review" 
Conclusion 
Of the 5 studies described in the article, cases involving V AXZEVRIA 
was lower (1 .03%) when compared to other mRNA vaccines. The review, 
however, should still be considered regarding involvement of other 
mRNA vaccines that exhibit similar complications.

Type of study / Objectives / Results 
AstraZeneca assessment 
Study type 
Systematic review and Meta-analysis 
Objective 
The main objective is to clarify the potential occurrence of 
myocarditis associated with COVID-19 vaccination and elaborate on 
the demographic and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 vaccinated 
individuals who develop myocarditis and how many cases have been 
reported in the literature 
Results 
Sixty-two studies, including 218 cases, participated in the current 
systematic review. The median age was 29.2 years; 92.2% were male 
and 7.8% were female. 72.4% of patients received the Pfizer­
BioNTech (COMIRNATY) vaccine, 23.8% of patients received the 
Modema COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273), and the rest of the 3.5% 
received other types of COVID-19 vaccine. Furthermore, most 
myocarditis cases (82. 1 % ) occurred after the second vaccine dose, 
after a median time interval of 3 .5 days. The most frequently reported 
symptoms were chest pain, myalgia/body aches and fever. Troponin 
levels were consistently elevated in 98.6% of patients. The admission 
ECG was abnormal in 88.5% of cases, and the left L VEF was lower 
than 50% in 21 .5% of cases. Most patients (92.6%) resolved 
symptoms and recovered, and only three patients died 
Overall conclusion as per author 
The findings may help public health policy to consider myocarditis in 
the context of the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination. 
Key findings and strength 
Demographics of included studies is very broad. 62 studies, including 218 
cases each, from the United States, Italy, Israel, Germany, Poland, France, 
Korea, Brazil, Japan, Mexico, Spain, New Zealand, Portugal, Germany, 
Iraq Turkey and Iran participated in this systematic review. 
Weakness 
•  Most of the studies were case reports/case series (many limitations: 
inability to assess causality particularly in incidental events, lack of 
generalisability, no denominator data, no comparison group, lack of 
information on known confounders, high risk of residual 
confounding, high risk of misclassification, publication bias, etc.) 
Percentage of myocarditis cases involving individuals who received 
V AXZEVRIA was not specified as compared to other vaccines eg, 72.4% 
of patients received the Pfizer-BioNTech (COMIRNATY) vaccine, 23.8% 
of patients received the Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine (mRNA-1273). 
Conclusion 
Although findings from the review suggests a male predisposition and 
multiple dosing as risk factors, incidence ofMyocarditis post Covid-19 
vaccination still similar to typical myocarditis cases. The quality of the 
included study finding do not contribute new safety information regarding 
causal relationship of event Myocarditis with V AXZEVRIA.

vaccination in 
adolescents and 
adults: a cumulative 
experience of 2021 
Aimed at describing a systematic literature review of myocarditis 
associated with the COVID-19 vaccine in all patients reported 
globally. 
Results 
Myocarditis occurred most commonly after the Pfizer-BioNTech 
mRNA vaccine (n = 1 83; 76.45) and after the second dose (n = 182; 
80%). Symptoms started 3.95 ± 4.5 days after vaccination. The 
commonest symptom was chest pain (n = 221 ;  93%) 
Overall conclusion as per author 
Histopathologically, lymphocytic myocarditis is present in the 
majority of cases. Patients are predominantly males of young age, but 
all ages and both sexes, as well as all types of vaccines, are 
represented. Women develop post-vaccine myocarditis at an older age 
and have longer hospital stay. 
Key findings and strength 
Review represents large international cohort of myocarditis that occurred 
within 60 days following COVID-19 vaccine. 
Females who presented with myocarditis post-vaccination were older than 
men (41 .3 ± 21.5 vs 25.7 ± 14 years, p = 0.001), were hospitalized for a 
longer duration (13.6 ± 21.7 days vs 3.9 ± 3.2 days, p = 0.02), and had a 
trend towards longer time between the vaccination and onset of symptoms 
(6.5 ± 7.2 days vs 3.7 ± 4.2 days in males, p = 0.08). Older patients also 
had a longer duration between the last dose of the vaccine and symptoms 
onset (4.8 days ± 5.5 days vs 3.0 ± 3.3 days, p = 0.04) 
Weakness 
Most of the studies were case reports/case series. 60% of cases reported in 
North America, but in absence of denominator data we cannot really 
compare countries 
-very few cases received V AXZEVRIA, and the denominators are 
unknown so cannot draw any conclusions comparing vaccines 
According to the author, "Several cases published in 2022 were not 
included in the analysis as reported cases were limited to 2021". 
Per Author, "due to inadequate data in some patients, some may have had 
concomitant pericarditis (myopericarditis) which may have a variable 
presentation from frank myocarditis." 
Conclusion 
The information available in this review is insufficient to suggest a causal 
association as risk factors such as medical history, confounders, etc was 
not ascertained Review was rather generalized for all vaccines as opposed 
to specific to V AXZEVRIA.

patients following 
COVID-19 mRNA 
vaccination 
Type of study / Objectives / Results 
AstraZeneca assessment 
Study type 
Systematic review 
Objective 
To determine whether spontaneous reporting rates of myocarditis and 
pericarditis differed in immunocompromised patients compared to the 
whole population overall, and in terms of demographics, vaccine 
dose, and time-to-onset. 
Results 
There were  106 reports of myocarditis and pericarditis amongst 
immunocompromised individuals overall. Seriousness was 
comparable between the immunocompromised and overall 
populations in both databases. No trends in age or sex were observed 
amongst immunocompromised individuals. Most reports (54.4%) to 
V AERS followed a second vaccine dose and 70.2% of events 
occurred within  14 days. The frequency of reporting was similar to 
the wider population (PRR=l .36 [95% CI= 0.89-1.82] for V AERS 
population). 
Overall conclusion as per author 
Myocarditis and pericarditis following COVID-19 vaccination are 
very rare, and benefits of COVID-19 vaccination continue to 
outweigh any perceived risks. Reporting rates of myocarditis and 
pericarditis were similar in immunocompromised individuals, 
however defining characteristics differed compared to the whole 
population; therefore, continued monitoring of adverse events 
following vaccination remains vital to understand differences between 
population subgroups. 
-
-
Key findings and strength 
This is the first study to investigate the frequency and 
characteristics of reported events of myocarditis and pericarditis 
in immunocompromised individuals compared with the 
population as a whole, bringing together data from two regions 
(Europe, the United States, and the UK). 
- Results from this study demonstrate that myocarditis and 
pericarditis are not more frequently reported following COVID-
19 mRNA vaccines for immunocompromised individuals as 
compared to the general population 
Weakness 
-
Per authors: As with all analyses using spontaneously reported 
data, results may have been subject to underreporting and 
missing information, including information on comorbidities and 
concomitant medications. It is possible that some 
immunocompromised were incorrectly classified as 
immunocompetent. Further biases may have influenced results, 
including differences in vaccination strategies between the two 
regions examined, differences in data collected via spontaneous 
reporting systems, and serious events more likely to be reported. 
Per authors: It is not possible to estimate incidence rates using 
spontaneous reports due to a lack of data on the exposed 
population, and there is no unexposed comparison group. 
Conclusion 
Current information was too limited to confirm causal relationship with 
VAXZEVRIA

vaccination: a 
systematic review 
and meta-analysis. 
Type of study / Objectives / Results 
Objective 
To characterize the incidence of myopericarditis following COVID-
19 vaccination and compare this with non-COVID-19 vaccination. 
Results 
Overall incidence of myopericarditis from 22 studies ( 405 272 721 
vaccine doses) was 33·3 cases  (95% CI 15·3- 72·6) per million 
vaccine doses, and did not differ significantly between people who 
received COVID-19 vaccines (18·2 [10·9- 30·3], 1 1  studies 
[395 361 933 doses], high certainty) and those who received non-
COVID-19 vaccines (56·0 [10·7- 293 ·7], 1 1  studies [9 910 788 
doses], moderate certainty, p=0·20 
Overall conclusion as per author 
This meta-analysis of more than 400 million doses of vaccines 
suggests that the overall incidence of myopericarditis following 
COVID-19 vaccination is similar to that in the published literature on 
its incidence after influenza vaccination, and is lower than the 
incidence after live smallpox vaccination 
AstraZeneca assessment 
- Younger males who received a second dose of mRNA COVID-
19 vaccine were at increased risk for myopericarditis 
-
Large sample size ( approximately 400 million vaccine doses) 
- Robust and clearly presented methodology, including restriction 
to observational studies where temporal relationship between 
exposure and outcome could be assumed (with some exceptions). 
Also, literature screening, data extraction, and quality assessment 
were carried out independently by three reviewers. 
- Assessment of study quality as well as grading of evidence using 
standard tools. 
-
-
Statistical synthesis: the authors conducted random effects meta-
analysis to estimate the pooled incidence of myopericarditis 
following vaccination, including COVID-19 vaccines, with 
appropriate assessment and reporting of heterogeneity. Also, 
sensitivity analyses were carried out to assess the impact of intra-
study risk of bias, and publication bias was assessed using 
standard methods. 
The risk was estimated by the type of vaccine (COVID-19 vs. 
non-COVID-19 vaccines, as well as mRNA COVID-19 vaccine 
vs. non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccines) as well as age-stratified 
subpopulations (adults vs. paediatrics). 
- Appropriate assessment of the effect of covariates on the 
incidence of myopericarditis, including the type of COVID-19 
vaccine (mRNA vs. non-mRNA), the dose of vaccine, age, sex.

From AZ's POV: the main weakness is that the effect of 
Vaxzveria was not assessed as it was grouped in the "non-
mRNA" group. 
Some data sources included registries with their inherent risk of 
misclassification as well as the lack oflongitudinal data. 
Potentially confounded comparisons between vaccines as this 
was carried out indirectly across studies which were carried at 
different time points. 
- Marked heterogeneity and imprecision across studies of non-
COVID-19 vaccines, which was evident in the wide confidence 
intervals around the estimated measures thereof. 
- No data on patients younger than  12 years receiving vaccination 
against COVID-19. 
- An umbrella term, "myopericarditis", was used by the authors to 
mitigate the marked heterogeneity across studies. However, this 
may not be useful if the outcome of interest is either condition. 
Conclusion 
The review provides compelling evidence of an increased of 
myopericarditis in younger males post dose two. However, information 
was too limited to assess the association with V AXZEVRIA.

Study type 
Systematic review and Meta-analysis 
Objective 
To delineate the demographics and clinical characteristics of vaccine-
associated myocarditis. 
Results 
A total of 57 studies containing 275  cases of COVID-19 vaccine-
associated myocarditis were catalogued. Mean age was 26.7 years and 
male to female ratio was 14: 1 .  For 86.9% of patients, myocarditis 
occurred after the second dose. Average time to onset and length of 
hospitalization were 3.7 and 3.9 days, respectively. Prognosis was 
largely benign, but there was a 1 . 1  % reported mortality. Chest pain 
(95.2%), elevation oftroponin (100%), and ST elevation on 
electrocardiography (68.5%) were common. Nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (81 .4%) were the most used medication, followed 
by colchicine (33.1 % ) 
Overall conclusion as per author 
Patients with COVID-19 vaccine-associated myocarditis are usually 
younger males presenting with chest pain 3-4 days after receiving 
their second dose of COVID vaccine. 
Key findings and strength 
Consistent with previous studies, myocarditis following mRNA COVID-
19 vaccines appeared to occur at a greater frequency in younger males, 
mostly following dose two. 
Weakness 
-
From AZ' s POV: the main weakness is the exclusion of cases 
associated with non-mRNA COVID-19 vaccines, including 
VAXZEVRIA. 
All of the 57 included studies were case reports/series, with all 
the limitations thereof which are listed in assessments of similar 
reviews above. Indeed, the authors listed several limitations that 
are specific to these study designs, including heterogeneity across 
studies with respect to clinical evaluations, selective reporting 
and publication bias. 
The analysis was descriptive in nature and thus cannot assess 
causal association, with the inability to adjust for potential 
confounding. 
-
-
Conclusion 
This review reiterates the reported association of mRNA COVID-19 
vaccines and myocarditis in younger males, mostly following dose two. 
However, the review does not provide any information relevant to 
V AXZEVRIA, and therefore, the information provided do not contribute 
new safety information regarding causal relationship of event Myocarditis 
with V AXZEVRIA.

Overall conclusion as per author 
In conclusion, postvaccination adverse  events need close monitoring 
to gain a more realistic view of possible complications and how best 
to approach them. 
Key findings and strength 
Consistent with previous studies, myocarditis following mRNA COVID-
19 vaccines appeared to occur at a greater frequency in younger males, 
mostly following dose two. 
Weakness 
-
This review was strictly restricted to case reports, and thus, all of 
the aforementioned limitations thereof apply. Counter-intuitively, 
the authors argued that the reason they applied such criterion was 
to "portray a better association between different factors and the 
risk ofpostvaccination myocarditis". This goes against the 
conventional epidemiologic wisdom that case reports are the 
least reliable design with respect to assessing causal associations. 
Conclusion

Mechanism of action articles review and summary identified during the reporting 
period 29 December 2021 to 28 June 2022 
The proposed mechanism from published literature is provided below: 
•  Molecular mimicry as potential mechanism eg, "antibodies against a part of the SARS­
Co V-2' s spike protein that the mRNA encodes for, cross-react with structurally similar 
host proteins in the heart. (Perez Y et al 202 1 ,  Tsilingiris D et al 202 1, Truong D T et al

Marsukjai A et al 2022 and Bollano E et al 2022) 
•  Hypersensitivity as potential mechanism -hypersensitivity myocarditis resulting from an 
inflammatory response to the vaccine (Scheuermeyer FX et al 2022, Nakanishi Y et al 
2022, Sexson Tejtel SK et al 2022, Chouchana L et al 2021, Won T et al 2022, Jamie S 
Y et al 202 1 ,  Bews H et al 2022, Moosmann J et al 2022 and Ahmed S K et al 2022) 
•  Hyper immune/inflammatory response, via exposure to spike protein, mRNA strand, or 
unknown trigger as potential mechanism eg, "The immune system may detect genes in 
the vaccine as antigens, thereby activating proinflammatory cascades and immune 
pathways that may play a role in the development of myocarditis" (Murakami Y et al 
2021 ,  Tsilingiris D et al 202 1 ,  Gomez Martin AM et al 2022, Wang M et al 2022, Cau R 
et al 2022, Parra-Lucares A et al 2021, Ohayon A et al and Park S et al 2022) 
• 
•  Dysregulated micro-RNA response as potential mechanism "pre-existing dysregulated 
pathways in certain individuals with predisposition, resulting in a polyclonal B-cell 
expansion, immune complex formation, and inflammation" (Dursun AD et al 2022, Chin 
SE et al 2022) 
Sex steroid hormones as potential mechanism eg, "The association of myocarditis with 
male sex and younger age could be attributed to sex hormones which may account for a 
more intense inflammatory response. As suggested by experimental studies on 
myocarditis in mice, testosterone may be implicated in the inhibition of anti­
inflammatory cells and the stimulation of immune responses mediated by Thl ­
lymphocytes" (Lazaros G et al 2021 ,  Bricoli S et al 2021). 
•  Maladaptive innate immune response activation triggered by mRNA vaccination against 
SARS-CoV2 (neutrophil infiltration and natural killer cells) as potential mechanism 
(Kawano H et al 2022).

•  Deposition of immune complex in cardiac pericyte due to expression of ACE2 as 
potential mechanism for myocarditis. "A more likely mechanism is where the vaccine 
lipid nanoparticles leak from the injection site and enter circulation where injection 
practices are not very well observed. Then they reach the heart and can be endocytosed 
by cardiac tissue including cardiac muscle, pericytes, endothelial cells, and macrophages. 
Local production of spike protein on the surface of cardiac cells and/or its shedding 
along with detached cell membranes may recruit neutrophils that also express ACE2 on 
their surface. Spike-activated neutrophils produce neutrophil extracellular traps that 
subsequently activate alternative pathway of complement in situ, damaging cardiac 
endothelial cells." (Kadkhoda K 2021) 
•  Antibody-mediated mechanisms characterized by elevated titres of serum anti-Spike 
antibody may be responsible for acute cardiac events following COVID-1 9  vaccination 
(Singh R et al 2021). 
Literature overview 
On review during the reporting period 29 December 202 1 to 28 June 2022, 68 articles were 
further assessed, of which 1 9  articles describing V AXZEVRIA versus 49 articles describing 
use of all other COVID vaccines (mRNA vaccine). No epidemiological articles with relevant 
new safety information were identified during the reporting period 29 December 202 1 to 28 
June 2022. According to the Fatima M et al 2022 article, mean onset of symptoms after 
vaccine administration was 3.8 ± 4.5 days and 75% of 97 reported cases developed symptoms 
after the second dose. This was also buttressed in Ahmed S K et al 2022 article which also 
demonstrates a strong male predominance for both conditions (Myocarditis and 
Myopericarditis). However, it was noted that females who presented with Myocarditis post­
vaccination were older than men (41 .3 ± 2 1 .5 vs 25.7 ± 14 years, p = 0.001 according to 
Ilonze OJ et al 2022 article. In addition and according to Ling RR et al 2022 article, incidence 
ofmyopericarditis in association with COVID-1 9  vaccines (mRNA vaccines) from 22 studies 
( 405 272 72 1 vaccine doses) was 33 • 3 cases (95% CI 15 • 3 -72 • 6) per million vaccine doses 
and did not differ significantly between people who received COVID-1 9  vaccines ( 1 8  • 2 
[10·9-30·3], 1 1  studies [395 361 933 doses], high certainty) and those who received non­
COVID-1 9  vaccines (56·0 [10·7- 293 · 7], 1 1  studies [9 910 788 doses], moderate certainty, 
p=0·20. 1 7  of 19 articles describing V AXZEVRIA in association with Myocarditis were 
discussed in the previous review of lCSRs retrieved from the AstraZeneca Global Patient 
Safety Database and remaining two articles was not a case report and did not contain any 
relevant safety information. On review of remaining 49 of 68 articles for all other COVID -19 
vaccines (mRNA vaccine) no new safety concerns regarding Myocarditis and association 
with V AXZEVRIA including information relating to a conclusive mechanism of action were 
identified. Of the 50 articles corresponding to Myocarditis, most frequent mechanism 
postulated was molecular mimicry (32), followed by hypersensitivity/inflammatory response 
(17), dysregulated micro-RNA response (2), sex predilection due to sex steroid hormones (2), 
maladaptive innate immune response activation (1), deposition of immune complex in cardiac 
pericyte due to expression of ACE2 (1) and Antibody-mediated mechanisms (1) amongst 
others.

Of761 Myocarditis cases, no gender preponderance was noted between males (50.9%) and 
females (49. 1 %). The majority of events (48.3%) were for vaccinees between the ages 40 to 
64 years. The majority (65.0%) of cases were reported after Dose 1 as compared to Dose 2 
(22.7%) and Dose 3 (0.8%). Out of 763 events from 761 reports, 99.9% events were serious 
with 2.8% resulting in death. There have been 266 (2 14 initial reports and 52 follow-up) 
additional case reports of Myocarditis compared to previous PBRER (with DCO December 
2021 that discussed 593 cases). Of 761 case reports, 1 .6% fulfilled BCC 1 criteria, 6.8% 
fulfilled BCC 2 criteria, no case fulfilled BCC 3 criteria, 5 1 .2% fulfilled BCC 4, and 40.3% 
fulfilled BCC 5 criteria. WHO-UMC causality assessment for Myocarditis was performed for 
64 cases (BCC levels 1 ,  2 and 3 cases), and none of the cases met WHO-UMC criteria for 
"Probable" (Likely) or "Certain". A total of 45.3% were considered as possibly related, 
21 .9% were considered as unlikely related, 25.0% were considered as 
Unassessable/Unclassifiable and 7.9% were considered as Conditional/Unclassified. In 
addition, 34.4% were identified with relevant risk/confounding factors and 65.6% cases had 
limited information for a comprehensive causal assessment. There were no case that reported 
a recurrence/worsening of myocarditis with a subsequent dose of V AXZEVRIA. There were 
no index cases identified from review of case reports. Observed vs expected analysis suggests 
that observed number of cases regardless of age, gender, dose and various risk windows did 
not exceed the expected number of cases. A review of literature suggests various 
hypothesized mechanisms for development ofMyocarditis mainly in association with mRNA 
vaccines. 
Conclusion 
From the data identified during the reporting period and also taking into account the 
cumulative experience, it is AstraZeneca's opinion that currently there is insufficient 
evidence of a causal association between myocarditis and V AXZEVRIA. AstraZeneca did 
not find evidence of a new or emerging signal for Myocarditis to suggest a need to update the 
V AXZEVRIA CDS or RMP. Myocarditis is an AESI for V AXZEVRIA and will continue to 
be kept under close surveillance by AstraZeneca.

June 2021 - 28 December 202 1)), further information on the topic of Sarcoidosis is requested 
as follows: 
The MAH is requested to provide a cumulative review of sarcoidosis cases (HLT "Acute and 
chronic sarcoidosis ") from all available sources,  including details of the underlying condition(s), 
time to onset, duration, outcome and an assessment of the causal relationship with the vaccine. 
Depending on the results of this review, the MAH should also discuss the need for any potential 
amendment to the product information, as appropriate.

Of 68 cases reported, 75 events were reported, and the following observations were made 
cumulatively through DLP 28 June 2022: 
64 (85.3%) of the events were serious (17 medically confirmed and 47 non-medically 
confirmed) and reported seriousness criteria were medically important event (45 [60.0%]), 
disability (15 [20.04%]), hospitalization (22 [29.3%]), life threatening (3 [4.0%]). An event 
may have met more than one criterion for seriousness. The remaining 1 1  (14.6%) events were 
non-serious (5 medically confirmed and 6 non-medically confirmed). 
•  Of the  75  events,  the  outcome  was  reported  as  resolved  or  recovering  1 6   (2 1 .3%), 
recovered/resolved with sequelae  8  (10.7%), not recovered/ not resolved 35 (46.7%) and 
none of the events is reported as fatal. The outcome of the remaining events were reported 
as unknown or not reported and that accounts for 1 6  (2 1 .3%). 
•  Amongst 8 events with reported outcome 'recovered' or 'recovered with sequelae, only one 
had the event duration of one day reported. 
Rechallenge / Recurrence case reports 
There were no case reports indicating potential recurrence / rechallenge cumulatively through

Overall, the cumulative review of cases did not identify an index case or a safety signal for 
V AXZEVRIA. A review of the post-marketing cases did not identify any index case or a 
safety signal. The cases provided insufficient information or were confounded by alternative 
aetiologies which precluded a proper causality assessment. 
Observed Versus Expected (0/E) analysis 
The background incidence rate(s) of sarcoidosis in the general population were obtained from 
literature articles from population based studies conducted in EU and South Korea. The 
literature is as analysed by Arkemer et al 2020 which have been used for this O/E analysis. 
This includes medically confirmed cases. 
AstraZeneca conducted an observed versus expected analysis for the event of sarcoidosis 
using the cumulative observed number of cases. The risk window of 7 - 1 80 days was derived 
upon review of Arkemer et al 2020 
An O/E analysis of sarcoidosis was conducted cumulatively through DLP 28 June 2022. The 
results were provided in line with 1 80 days risk windows for EEA and UK case reports, 
including unknown TTO. Please refer to Appendix 8 for the methodology of the O/E analyses 
and Appendix 9 for any additional sensitivity analysis. 
The O/E analysis for the cumulative cases of sarcoidosis with risk window of 1 80 days, is 
presented with results in Table 80 below. 
Conservatively, the exposure for global reports (448306152) is based on doses administered

Literature 
A cumulative literature search through 28 June 2022 of the databases in Embase, 
InsightMeme and PubMed was conducted using the following search criteria. The following 
search terms were used: Cutaneous Sarcoidosis; Heerfordt's syndrome; Liver Sarcoidosis; 
Loefgren syndrome; Muscular Sarcoidosis; Neurosarcoidosis; Ocular sarcoidosis; Pulmonary 
sarcoidosis; Cardiac sarcoidosis, Sarcoidosis; Sarcoidosis of Lymph node. 
The search retrieved 9 articles of which contained no relevant new safety information 
regarding Sarcoidosis and its association with V AXZEVRIA. None of the 9 articles provided 
relevant hypothesised mechanism of action for Sarcoidosis in association with mRNA or 
VAXZEVRIA 
Discussion on Biological Plausibility and Possible Mechanisms 
Sarcoidosis is an immunologically mediated disorder. Pathogenesis is believed to be a 
two-step process, requiring: ( 1) an initial exposure to an antigen that is presented to CD4+ T 
lymphocytes by antigen-presenting cells (human leukocyte antigen [HLA] class II 
molecules); and (2) an inflammatory milieu in which the antigen presentation can take place. 
Following antigen presentation, there is upregulation of the immune response, with activation 
of alveolar macrophages and dendritic cells, and development of memory for the causal 
antigen (sensitization) (Oliver and Zarnke 2021 ).  Sarcoidosis is associated most strongly with 
HLA class II molecules on chromosome 6. The HLA-DRB l □ 1 1 :01 allele is associated with 
increased risk for sarcoidosis in African-American and White subjects. HLA-DRBl □ 1 1  :01

and occupational exposure to insecticides have been shown to interact in a positive manner to 
increase the risk for sarcoidosis (p < 0. 1 0) and to increase risk for extrapulmonary sarcoidosis 
(p < 0.05), indicating the importance of both genetic and environmental factors (Oliver and 
Zarnke 2021 ). 
However, as already mentioned, there is no hypothesised mechanism for the development of 
sarcoidosis in association with V AXZEVRIA. 
In conclusion, a cumulative literature review through 28 June 2022 did not identify any 
article with significant safety information relating to V AXZEVRIA and sarcoidosis. 
Summary 
Cumulatively through DLP 28 June 2022, a total of 68 case reports of sarcoidosis with the 
use of V AXZEVRIA have been received using a broad search strategy, of which 85.3% of 
the reported events were serious and 14.6% were non-serious. The age range was 21years to 
67 years and median age was reported as and 49.4 years.30.8% of cases were medically 
confirmed and 69 . 1  % were not medically confirmed. 
The most common PTs reported were Cutaneous Sarcoidosis 2 (2.7%), Loefgren syndrome 3 
(4.0%), Neurosarcoidosis 5 (6.7%), Pulmonary sarcoidosis 5 (6.7%), Cardiac sarcoidosis 2 
(2.7%), Sarcoidosis 57 (76.0%) and Ocular sarcoidosis 1 (1 .3%). 
Amongst 75 events reported for sarcoidosis received cumulatively through 28 June 2022, 35 
(46.7%) had a reported outcome not recovered, 16 (21 .3%) for recovering/resolved, 8 
(10.7%) recovered with sequeale and 16 (21 .3%) had outcome unknown. 
OE analysis showed that observed cases were significantly less than expected cases. 
WHO UMC case causality analysis conducted for all case reports, the majority of the case 
reports (24 [35.3%]) were considered possible with limited information, possible with 
confounder (20 [29.4%]) and unassesable/unclassifiable with limited information (19 
[27.9%]) related to V AXZEVRIA. 
Overall, the clinical pattern of case presentation and numbers of reports are broadly 
consistent with what might be expected from the natural epidemiology of sarcoidosis, and no 
specific biological mechanism through which V AXZEVRIA vaccine could cause or

Conclusion 
Based on the review of the updated cumulative data, AstraZeneca considers that there is 
insufficient evidence to suggest a causal association between sarcoidosis and V AXZEVRIA. 
It is AstraZeneca's opinion that no changes to the CDS or RMP are warranted at this time. 
The topic will continue to be closely monitored as part of AstraZeneca's ongoing surveillance

Subacute Thyroiditis 
Background 
Following review of the PBRER (reporting period 29 June 2021 to 28 December 2021) 
(EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/0001 0912/2021 12) AstraZeneca was requested to address Subacute 
thyroiditis in the next PBRER as follows: 
- A review and discussion of the available literature on the relationship between subacute 
thyroiditis and vaccination with  V AXZEVRIA. 
- A review of the medically confirmed cases with a formal causality assessment using 
WHO-UMC criteria, and case description that allows to reproduce the assessment. 
AstraZeneca's responses to these requests are provided in the subsections below. 
Global Patient Safety Database 
A cumulative search of the AstraZeneca Global Safety Database for Subacute thyroiditis with 
V AXZEVRIA was performed using MedDRA version 25.0 for the period 29 December 2020 
to 28 June 2022. The search strategy included the following PTs: Subacute thyroiditis which 
include Autoimmune thyroiditis; Immune-mediated thyroiditis; Silent thyroiditis; Thyroiditis; 
Thyroiditis acute; and Thyroiditis subacute 
Cumulatively, the search retrieved a total of 1 87 events of Subacute thyroiditis in 178 case 
reports. 
The case source and seriousness distribution for Subacute thyroiditis received cumulatively 
through DLP 28 June 2022 is presented in Table 8 1 :

Cases were considered to have ''risk factors/confounders" where the event could also be explained by the 
vaccinee's diseases, or where relevant risk factors were present, or concomitant medications that could 
potentially contribute to the development of the event were reported. 
Amongst 52 medically confirmed cases for subacute thyroiditis, 5 case reports (9.61 %) were 
identified either with relevant risk / confounding factors as presented in Table  85 above. 
These are presented into the following categories for risk / confounding factors in descending 
order of frequency. 
The confounders included Hashimoto's thyroiditis (2), thyroid nodule (1), Basedow's 
disease (1 ), and thyroid disorder (1 ). 
In the remaining 47 (90.4%) out of 52 case reports, there was insufficient information with 
respect to either dose latency, medical history,  laboratory values or concomitant medication 
details required for a comprehensive causal assessment. 
Overall, the review of medically confirmed cases did not identify any new relevant safety 
information or an index case for V AXZEVRIA. 
Rechallenge / Recurrence case reports 
There were no case reports identified for Subacute thyroiditis after the Dose 1 ,  with a 
recurrence or worsening of subacute thyroiditis with the Dose 2/Dose 3 of vaccination 
indicating potential recurrence / positive rechallenge cumulatively through DLP 
28 June 2022.

(TRAb,  TPO Ab) remained non-detectable in the  12 week/allow up)  cannot be considered to have a temporal relationship to vaccine. Also progression of initial

On review of the 1 1  literature case reports, majority of cases were concerning female gender 
(n = 7; 64%) which is in line with known gender distribution on subacute thyroiditis cases 
(Rothacker 2016, Oyibo 2021, Stasiak and Lewinski 2021). The age distribution ranged 
from 1 9  to 76 years (median 49.5 years). The V AXZEVRIA dose details were reported in 
1 0  cases with dose 1 in 8 cases (80%) and dose 2 in 2 cases (20%). The TTO varied from 3 to 
30 days for events after dose 1 (median = 21 days) with majority within O to 2 1  days (6 out of 
7 cases). Although only 2 cases were reported following dose 2, the reported TTO of 5 days 
and 14 days varied widely precluding any singular etiopathogenesis. 
The presentation of subacute thyroiditis in the general population is usually characterised by 
severe pain, swelling, and tenderness in the thyroid region accompanied by malaise, fatigue, 
myalgia, and arthralgia with an initial thyrotoxic phase with raised inflammatory markers, 
followed by a hypothyroid phase and then a recovery phase (Stasiak and Lewinski 2021). 
An important differentiating factor with other immune mediated thyroid disorders may be 
low radioactive iodine or isotope intake test (Sriphrapradang 2016). Of the 1 1  literature 
case reports, in 5 case reports the case information on presenting clinical thyroid status, neck 
pain, low isotope intake, and disease duration were suggestive of sub-acute thyroiditis. In 2 
cases 
while in 2 cases ( 
without any thyroid specific features. In the remaining 2 cases there was insufficient 
information to confirm a subacute thyroiditis. In summary, the clinical presentation of 
subacute thyroiditis was too varied to suggest a singular vaccine based etiopathogenesis. 
, there was clinical presentation of hypothyroidism, 
the thyroid status was seen incidentally 
In all 1 0  cases, clinical and/or biochemical resolution was reported. Thyroiditis specific 
treatment was reported in 10 cases comprised of beta-blocker therapy (6 cases), prednisolone 
with beta-blocker (2 cases), prednisolone (1  case), and spontaneous regression (in 1 case, 
. As beta-blockers are not directed to underlying etiology of subacute 
thyroiditis, most cases can be considered to have resolved spontaneously. This precluded any 
trend of vaccine induced immune etiopathogenesis. 
The WHO-UMC causality was assessed as Possible with confounders in 1 case (MTHFR 
A1298C mutation, family history ofHashimoto's disease), possible with limited information 
in 8 cases (based on temporal association only in backdrop of limited etiological workup), 
and unlikely in 1 case (due to implausible TTO). In the remaining 1 case, due to insufficient 
information on latency to vaccine administration, a comprehensive causal assessment was not 
possible. 
To summarize, an analysis of the 1 1  cases either have limited information or do not present 
any significant trend to confirm a causal role ofV AXZEVRIA COVID-1 9  vaccination.

Of the 48 articles,  15 articles were considered relevant for further evaluation and discussion

Articles suggesting hypothesized mechanisms for the development of sub­
acute thyroiditis post COVID-19 Vaccination 
Summary of the potential mechanisms from literature is provided below: 
•  Molecular mimicry as potential mechanism for autoimmune thyroiditis for eg, SARS­
Co V-2 spike protein, nucleoprotein, and membrane proteins all cross-reacted with 
thyroid peroxidase (TPO) (Sozen, M et al. 2021 ,  Vasileiou et al 202 1 ,  Khan et al 2022, 
Capezzone M et al 2022, Bostan et al. 2022, Adelmeyer et al 2022, Marsukjai A et al 
2022 and Pla Peris et al. 2022) 
•  Autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA) as potential 
mechanism for autoimmune thyroiditis as an entity that incorporates diverse autoimmune 
conditions induced by the exposure to various adjuvants (Khan et al 2022, Adelmeyer et 
al 2022, Uzoma et al. 2022, Alkis et al. 2022, El Haddad et al 2022 and Pla Peris et al. 
2022) postulated. 
Increased blood viscosity induced by vaccine which might contribute to thyrotoxicosis 
(Mungmunpuntipantip and Wiwanitkit 2022). The association between hyperviscosity and 
thyrotoxicosis is proposed. An increasing of blood viscosity is due to rapid increased level of 
antibody after vaccination and the viscosity will decrease when there is a decline of antibody 
level. Finally, if thyroid hormone test is based on immunoassay, an interference, a false 
aberration of hormone level might be induced by a high blood viscosity. However, the article 
did not present evidence for this hypothesis. 
AZ comment: Regarding molecular mimicry, cross-reactivity between the coronavirus spike 
protein produced after vaccination and thyroid cell antigens is suggested as an underlying 
mechanism. However, the molecular basis of the structural similarity between these antigens 
was not described further. The authors proposed that subacute thyroiditis is a phenomenon of 
autoimmune inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA). It was suggested that in 
genetically predisposed individuals, the administration of adjuvants may trigger an 
autoimmune response which might lead to subacute thyroiditis. The  authors suggest that the 
vaccine may induce increase in blood viscosity due to increased antibody level after 
vaccination and that there is an association between hyper viscosity and thyrotoxicosis. It was 
not elaborated how increased blood viscosity might lead to thyrotoxicosis. 
This cumulative review of literature has not identified any new safety information on the 
association of subacute thyroiditis with V AXZEVRIA.

Summary 
Cases were assessed by age, sex, type of event, and outcome. Of the 178 case reports of 
subacute thyroiditis with the use ofV AXZEVRIA have been received, of which 64.6% of the 
reported events were serious and 35.4% were non-serious. The age range was 1 9  to 83 years 
and mean and median age was reported as 5 1  years and 50 years, respectively. The case 
reports were reported more in females 138 (77.5%) compared to males 35 (1 9.7%). 29.2% of 
cases were medically confirmed and 70.8% were not medically confirmed. Subacute 
thyroiditis is generally reported in the 3rd to 5th decade, and is 1 .9 to 6 times more frequent 
in females (Fatourechi et al 2003). For the event of subacute thyroiditis, the most common 
PTs reported were Autoimmune thyroiditis ( 49), Thyroiditis ( 60), Thyroiditis acute (22), and 
Thyroiditis subacute (56). 
Amongst 178 case reports for subacute thyroiditis received cumulatively through DLP 
28 June 2022, 64 events had a reported outcome of recovered or recovering, the outcome of 
recovered with sequelae was reported in 7 case reports, and the case outcome of Not 
recovered was reported in 88 of the case reports. No fatal event pertaining to searched term of 
'Subacute thyroiditis' was reported. The TTO was varied and ranged from O to 1 day to more 
than 42 days and there was no trend or pattern seen. Of the 178 Subacute thyroiditis cases 
reported globally and included in AstraZeneca's post-marketing database, there were 1 1 8 
case reports in which the TTO was within the risk window of 42 days. Underlying 
cause/confounding factors were noted in 9.6% of these cases. 
The characteristics of the events and of the individuals with events were as expected for the 
general population, including the observation of increased incidence in the elderly. No usual 
trends or clusters were identified. None of the cases met WHO-UMC criteria for Certain or 
Probable/Likely. Of the 178 cases, there were no fatal cases. 
The 0/E analysis results for subacute thyroiditis showed observed cases to be significantly 
less than expected. 
The majority of non-medically confirmed case reports had limited information. Of the total 
number of case reports, 52 (29.2%) were medically confirmed. WHO-UMC case causality 
assessment for majority 32 (61 .5%) medically confirmed case reports was "Possible" with 
limited information; these cases lacked information about medical history, concomitant 
medications, or laboratory values and no trend was seen. However, 4 (7.7%) case reports 
demonstrated possible risk factors/confounders and were assessed as possible with 
confounders. In 6 (1 1 .5%) cases the time to onset was outside the risk window of 42 days and 
therefore assessed as unlikely related to V AXZEVRIA. In 10 (19.2%) cases the time to onset 
was unknown and were assessed as "Unassessable". 
Overall, none of the case reports raised any new relevant safety concerns for subacute 
thyroiditis cumulatively until DLP 28 June 2022 during the reporting period. Also, in 
summary, the review of available data from spontaneous reports regarding of Subacute 
thyroiditis did not identify an index case or other evidence of a new or emerging signal.

Conclusion 
Based on the review of the available cumulative data, AstraZeneca considers that currently 
there is insufficient evidence of a causal association between subacute thyroiditis and 
V AXZEVRIA. It is AstraZeneca's opinion that no changes to the V AXZEVRIA CDS or 
RMP are warranted at this time. Subacute thyroiditis is an AESI for V AXZEVRIA and will 
continue to be closely monitored as part of AstraZeneca's ongoing surveillance activities. 
AstraZeneca will no longer discuss the topic future PBRERs, unless significant new safety 
information arises.

Glomerulonephritis AND N ephrotic syndrome (including IgA 
Nephropathy) 
In the assessment report received from the PRAC EMA (PRAC PAR 
EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00010912/202 1 12) for the V AXZEVRIA PBRER (review period 
29 June 2021 - 29 December 2021), further information on the topic of Glomerulonephritis 
AND Nephrotic syndrome (including IgA Nephropathy) is requested from AstraZeneca as 
follows: 
The MAH is requested to submit: 
• a cumulative review of cases based on search conducted at the level of HLT 
"glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome "; 
• causality assessments of the cases; 
• a review of articles published during the PSUR reporting period; 
• a discussion on the need for updating product information and/or risk management plan, 
and submit proposal as required. 
AstraZeneca's response to these requests are provided in the subsection below. 
Additional note to the MAH: Published cases should be submitted to Eudravigilance and 
attempts should be made to follow up  on poorly documented spontaneous cases. 
AstraZeneca Response:  14 cases were identified in the literature and have been submitted to 
Eudra Vigilance. The spontaneous cases are followed up where reporter contact details are 
available and consent to follow-up has been provided. As much information as possible is 
obtained when the AE report is first received. Further active follow-up is performed to obtain 
the necessary data to allow appropriate medical evaluation of the case. Glomerulonephritis is 
kept under close surveillance thus maximum number of follow-up attempts are made 
according to the AstraZeneca process, ie, 3 contacts with reporter. 
Glomerulonephritis Background 
Glomerulonephritis is the term applied to a group of diseases characterised by inflammatory 
changes in glomerular capillaries and accompanying signs and symptoms of an acute 
nephritic syndrome; particularly haematuria, proteinuria, and diminished renal function in 
some cases associated with fluid retention, hypertension, and oedema (Couser 1 999). The 
aetiological description refers to primary (aetiology unknown, generally thought to be a

manifestation of autoimmunity) or secondary ( associated with one of several autoimmune, 
infectious, malignant, or metabolic diseases) forms of glomerulonephritis (Chadban & Atkins 
2005). The major pathological types of glomerulonephritis are IgA nephropathy (IgAN), 
membranous nephropathy (MN), membrano-proliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), 
mesangial proliferative glomerulonephritis, minimal change disease (MCD), focal segmental 
glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), post-infectious glomerulonephritis, idiopathic crescentic 
proliferative glomerulonephritis, ANCA-associated necrotising crescentic 
glomerulonephritis, anti-glomerular basement membrane disease (Kazi and Hashmi 2022, 
KDIGO 2012). The underlying pathogenetic mechanism common to all of these different 
varieties of glomerulonephritis (GN) is immune-mediated (humoral as well as cell-mediated 
pathways may be active) followed by consequent inflammatory response; whether restricted 
to the kidney, or if associated with systemic immune-mediated disease. The principles of 
management of GN also involves immunosuppression alongside management of 
complications (blood pressure, proteinuria, control edema, and nephrotic syndrome) and 
removal of insult (KDIGO 2012). Kidney biopsy is mandatory for diagnosis (KDIGO 2012). 
IgA Nephropathy (or Berger's disease) is the most common of all glomerulonephritis. IgA is 
an antibody that plays a crucial part in mucosa! immunity (Lai et al, 201 6). The name of 
IgAN originates from predominant IgA immune complex deposition in the glomerular 
mesangium on biopsy (including immunofluroescence) which is also the only confirmatory 
diagnosis (Farooq et al 202 1 ;  Lai et al, 201 6). It is characterized by deposition (or possibly in 
situ formation) ofpathogenetic polymeric IgAl immune complexes (occasionally with IgG 
and IgM) in the glomerular mesangium, proliferation of mesangial cells, increased synthesis 
of extracellular matrix and variable infiltration of macrophages, monocytes and T cells. IgA 
and IgG that recognize the autoantigen IgAl in IgAN are typically also reactive against 
antigens from extrinsic microorganisms involved in recurrent upper respiratory and 
gastrointestinal mucosa! infections; the nephritogenic IgAl molecules are produced by B 
cells following mucosa! infections, particularly tonsillitis (Lai et al, 201 6). IgAN can also be 
seen in the transplanted kidney and it points to a systemic immunochemical abnormality 
(Chailimpamontree et al, 2009; Lai et al, 201 6). IgAN can occur in either sporadic (90-95%) 
or familial (5-10%) patterns (Lai et al, 201 6). Although a consistent definition of secondary 
IgAN in the literature however systemic disorders associated with secondary IgA 
nephropathy - Gastrointestinal and Liver disorders ( cirrhosis, Inflammatory bowel diseases), 
Infections ( chronic mucosa! infections, lyme disease, chlamydia, hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, 
Human Immuno deficiency Virus etc), Autoimmune disorders (Henoch-Schonlein purpura, 
IgA vasculitis, etc), Respiratory tract disorders, Neoplasms (may be causal such as IgA 
myeloma, lymphomas and solid malignancies) and genetic associations (Saha et al 2018; 
Kiryluk et al, 2012;; Kiryluk et al, 2014; Pouria and Bharratt 2008). 
The age standardized rates in 201 9  for incidence of acute glomerulonephritis per 100,000 
population were 9.45 (95% uncertainty interval, 7.72 to 1 1 .55) and the mortality rate was 
0. 13(95% uncertainty interval, 0. 1 0  to 0. 16) (Guo et al 2021). IgA Nephropathy (or Berger's 
disease) is the most common of all glomerulonephritis with an incidence estimated to be 2.5 
per 100,000 patient years (Sethi et al 201 6; McGrogan 201 1). It is characterised by immune

complex deposition in the glomerular mesangium on biopsy (including immunofluroescence) 
which is also the only confirmatory diagnosis (Farooq et al 202 1 ;  Lai et al, 201 6). 
Nephrotic syndrome (NS) represents the clinical manifestations of several kidney diseases, 
characterized clinically by the presence of peripheral edema, heavy proteinuria, 
hypoalbuminemia, and hypercholesterolemia. Most adult patients with NS have primary 
glomerular diseases, including FSGS, MN, and MCD) (Kodner 201 6; Hull and Goldsmith, 
2008; 0th and Ritz 1 998). Although the population incidence of NS is estimated to be 
approximately 3 per 1 00,000 person-years (Gao et al 2021).

Events with fatal outcome 
Of the 130 events of Glomerulonephritis and Nephrotic syndrome (including IgA 
Nephropathy), 1 (0.8%) event of glomerulonephritis proliferative was reported with fatal 
outcome, and is summarized below. 
received from a health professional from India regarding a 78 year 
The case 
old male patient who experienced pneumonia, emphysema, alveolar proteinosis, interstitial 
lung disease and glomerulonephritis proliferative after an unspecified time post unknown 
dose of V AXZEVRIA. The cause of death was reported as lobar pneumonia, emphysema, 
pulmonary alveolar proteinaceous, interstitial lung disease and proliferative 
glomerulonephritis. 
AstraZeneca comment: Pneumonia could be the infectious trigger for glomerulonephritis. 
The events of pneumonia, interstitial lung disease,  emphysema and alveolar proteinosis can 
also explain the fatality in the backdrop of advanced age of the patient.  The event of 
emphysema usually have a chronic clinical course. However,  due to insufficient information 
on onset latency of the events, baseline health condition including renal status,  clinical 
course, etiological workup, renal biopsy,  autopsy,  concomitant medication and corrective 
therapy,  a comprehensive causal assessment could not be performed.

Comments: As reported the patient experienced a flare after each of the four vaccinations and that the underlying 
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis has progressively worsened. After the V AXZEVRIA dose 1, the patient experienced Acute 
kidney injury (AKI)  after 66 days.  Therafter flares were experienced after V AXZEVRIA dose 2, Irifluenza vaccine, 3rd COVID-
19 vaccine (mRNA), however exact latency was not reported.  On workup,  blood tests had not shown a flare or alternatively an 
infection.  The patient has previously had four major flares and a number of minor flares mostly caused by  infections or 
operations such as his cholecystectomy or ERCP.  The patient was on Rituximab fnjusions as required. The patient had been on 
past drug therapy of cyclophosphamide, steroids and azathioprine, however the exact duration since discontinuation was not 
reported. 
The TTO of first flare of renal symptom (AKI) following COVID-19 vaccination of 66 days  is considered unduly prolonged. A 
vaccine induced flare would have been expected to manifest in much shorter timeframe considering its immunological 
response. Moreover,  considering the onset of past and current flares to infections,  operations, different vaccine types,  the 
contributory role of V AXZEVRIA is considered unlikely.

insufficient information on exclusion of infections (especially COVID-19) and on patient's medical history for a comprehensive 
causal assessment.

On review of the 3 cases reporting recurrence / worsening, the AEs of nephrotic syndrome, 
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and Glomerulonephritis minimal lesion were singularly 
reported, and no trend was seen. The TTO of the events of interest after 1 st dose ( 5 days, 7 
days, 66 days) presented a widely varied picture, precluding possibility of any specific 
etiopathogenesis. In all the 3 cases, an exact clinical course of the events were not reported. 
Corrective therapy was reported in only 1 case 
as corticosteroids which was 
interrupted before 2nd vaccine dose. Interruption ofprednisolone could possibly confound the 
recurrence. In 1 case 
reported to multiple stimuli like infections, major operations and vaccines (irrespective of 
type) during an extended course, thus precluding any direct causality to a specific vaccine 
type. 
recurrence ( of Granulomatosis with polyangiitis) was 
, medically confirmed) reported information of ongoing 
One additional case 
resolution of the event of granulomatosis with polyangiitis despite administration of 2nd 
vaccine dose. The initial event had a TTO of 36 days after 1st dose of COVID-1 9  
vaccination. The case was assessed as per WHO-UMC causality as possible only based on 
temporal association. There was insufficient information on medical history, concomitant 
medications and etiological workup. 
In summary, a review of the cases of recurrence / worsening did not identify any specific 
trends to events, vaccine type, onset latency and any patient susceptibility. The recurrence 
was confounded in one case while there was insufficient information on clinical course and 
concomitant medications in the remaining two cases for a comprehensive assessment. 
WHO-UMC causality assessment for medically confirmed cases 
Of the total 1 15 case reports identified cumulatively through DLP of 28 Jun 2022, 66 (57.4%) 
case reports comprising 75 events of interest were medically confirmed (63 serious and 3 
non-serious). 
Out of 66 medically confirmed cases pertaining to Glomerulonephritis AND Nephrotic 
syndrome (including IgA Nephropathy), 7 case reports reported a relapse or flare-up of pre-
•  The  reported  PTs  were  Nephrotic  syndrome  (n=4; 
,  Glomerulonephritis  minimal  lesion  (n=2; 
, Microscopic polyangiitis ( n= 1 ;  
•  On review of 4 cases of nephrotic syndrome, the underlying renal disease was reported in 2 
cases (minimal change disease, FSGS). Three out of 4 cases ofnephrotic syndrome reported 
relapses or flare-up  following  1 st COVID-1 9  vaccination (TTO of 3 days, 7 days,  14 days) 
while  1  case reported after 2nd  COVID-1 9  vaccination (unspecified TTO). None of the 4 
cases ofNephrotic syndrome reported renal biopsy findings. 
•  On review of2 cases ofGlomerulonephritis minimal lesion, both cases presented with frothy 
urine within 1 day of 1 st dose of COVID-1 9  vaccine administration. No renal biopsy findings 
were reported.

•  The  event  of  Microscopic  polyangiitis  was  reported  1 3   days  after  2nd  COVID-1 9  
vaccination, however no renal symptoms or renal biopsy findings were specified. 
•  Overall, there was insufficient information on baseline clinical status of the underlying renal 
pathologies.  The  pre-existing  treatment  details  was  reported  only  in  2  out  of 7  cases 
(tacrolimus therapy), however there was insufficient information on any action taken with 
the tacrolimus prior to COVID-1 9  vaccination. 
•  Out of the 7 cases of relapse / flare-up, confounders for flare-up was identified in 4 cases 
(COPD, hypertension, mild renal impairment eGFR, neoplasm, previous history ofrelapses 
of  nephrotic  syndrome,  severely  high  BMI  of  45.5  kg/m2  and  concomitant 
sulfamethoxazole ). In the remaining 2 out of 7 cases, there was insufficient information on 
any action taken with the immunosuppressants (tacrolimus) prior to COVID-1 9  vaccination. 
•  In summary on review of medically confirmed case reports of a relapse or flare-up of pre­
existing condition, no trend was seen on temporal association based on widely varied TTO 
and some presenting only after 2nd  vaccination. This also precludes any  singular immune 
mediated hypothesis (non-specific  or  adaptive  immune response). Moreover, majority of 
cases had confounders. 
Causality assessment was performed based on WHO-UMC criteria and a risk window of 42

In the remaining 41 (62%) out of 66 case reports, there was insufficient information with 
respect to either dose latency, medical history or concomitant medication details for a 
comprehensive causal assessment. 
Overall, the review of medically confirmed cases did not raise any new relevant safety 
information for V AXZEVRIA. 
Nephrotic syndrome 
Out of the 130 events pertaining to searched topics of Glomerulonephritis AND Nephrotic 
syndrome (including IgA Nephropathy), 46 PTs ofNephrotic syndrome in 43 cases were 
identified, cumulatively till 28 June 2022. 
Out of the 46 events ofNephrotic syndrome, 36 were serious and 10 were non-serious. The 
TTO was reported in 27 (62.8%) cases. The mean and median TTO was 39 days (mean) and 
1 8  days (median) respectively. The distribution of most frequently co-reported renal events in 
4 case reports for Nephrotic syndrome were Glomerulonephritis minimal lesion (4 cases), 2 
cases each of Glomerulonephritis membranous, FSGS, AKI and singular case of Chronic

pathology for the presentation of nephrotic syndrome was not reported. Also, the co-reported 
renal events do not show any particular trend with V AXZEVRIA vaccine. 
Amongst 46 events,  14 events had a reported outcome of recovered or recovered with 
sequelae. The majority of events had a reported outcome of not recovered ( 45 .6%) at the time 
of reporting and were mostly reported via regulatory source. Amongst 14 cases with reported 
outcome 'recovered' or 'recovered with sequelae,' the event duration was reported in  1 
(7. 1  %) case (232 days). No event of fatal Nephrotic syndrome was reported. 
On review of 23 medically confirmed cases pertaining to Nephrotic syndrome, 1 8  (78%) 
cases were assessed on WHO-UMC causality scale as 'Possible' based on temporal 
association only with confounders identified in 5 out of 1 8  cases (28%). Three cases (17%) 
were assessed as 'Unlikely' based on unreasonable time relationship of event to vaccination 
and presence of alternate explanations. The remaining 2 cases could not be comprehensively 
assessed due to insufficient information on vaccine latency and clinical course of the event. 
Four case reports reported a relapse or flare-up of pre-existing nephrotic syndrome were 
identified. However, no trend was seen on temporal plausibility based on varied TTO (3, 7 
and 14 days, and unspecified after 2nd vaccination , one case 
after 2nd vaccination, and three cases 
presenting only after 1 st vaccination. The two underlying renal pathologies were singularly 
reported. This also precludes any singular etiopathogenesis. Amongst 23 medically confirmed 
cases pertaining to Nephrotic syndrome, 8 (35%) were identified either with relevant risk / 
confounding factors [pre-existing dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus (3 cases); pre-existing renal 
conditions (previous relapses, poor corticocentral differentiation of the kidney) 2 cases; 
concurrent infection (polyp and diverticulitis) in 1 case; neoplasms in 1 case; and 
concomitant medication of amiodarone (for vasculitis), letrozole (for edema) in 1 case]. 
Overall, none of the case reports raised any new relevant safety concerns for the event of 
V AXZEVRIA and nephrotic syndrome. 
IgA Nephropathy 
Out of the 130 events pertaining to searched term of Glomerulonephritis AND Nephrotic 
syndrome (including IgA Nephropathy),  13 PTs of lgA Nephropathy in 1 3  cases were 
identified, cumulatively till 28 June 2022 
The majority of the IgA nephropathy events were serious (9 out of 1 3  events, 69%). No events 
were reported with a fatal outcome. The seriousness criteria of one event was life-threatening, 
however,  the  basis  for  life-threatening nature  was  not  specified  in  the  case  narratives.  The 
presenting features  of the IgAN as reported only in 38.5% of the  cases (n=5  out of 1 3) was 
gross  hematuria. Although,  the  clinical  presentation  of IgAN  is  varied  from asymptomatic 
microscopic  haematuria  to  a  rapidly  progressive  form  of glomerulonephritis,  macroscopic 
haematuria may not be an infrequent initial presentation oflgAN (Lai et al, 201 6). Proteinuria

symptom but was reported at a later date and thus a conclusive confirmation as manifestation 
oflgA nephropathy could not be made. Hypertension was reported in one case 
however it was not considered a de novo clinical feature secondary to IgAN as the patient had 
a medical history of the same. The commonly co-reported events were IgAN (haematuria), or 
concurrent  IgA  vasculitis  (Henoch-Schonlein purpura)  which  could  be  in  association with 
IgAN,  listed events (myalgia, pyrexia) and concurrent influenza. Owing to very few cases of 
Henoch-Schonlein purpura (3 cases), no significant trends in predisposition to underlying IgA 
pathogenesis can be comprehensively made. Although, none of the cases reported acute kidney 
) reported serum creatinine  levels  of 1 .4  (unspecified units). 
mJury,  one case 
Information on renal biopsy was available in only 5 cases with biopsy confirmation of IgAN 
in 3 case, while in 2 cases only a clinical diagnosis was done and renal biopsy not performed. 
None  of the  cases  had  information  on  immunotyping  of IgA  deposits  (such  as  IgAl), 
correlation with serum IgA levels, correlation with vaccine immunogenicity ( such as spike IgG 
Ab,  neutralizing  antibodies),  other  immunological  determinants  in  renal  biopsy  (such  as 
complements). Majority of cases (6 out of 1 3) did not report any etiological work-up such as 
gastrointestinal and liver disorders,  infections,  autoimmune  disorders, neoplasms or genetic 
associations, while in 2 cases the relevant investigations were limited to radiology of kidney, 
ureter, bladder and of abdomen. Possible concurrent mucosa! infections as suggested by UTI, 
influenza with oropharyngeal pain, use of benzathine penicillin was reported in 3 out of 1 3  
cases and may contribute to IgA immune response. 
The medical history was reported in 7 out of 13 cases (54%) out of which majority (4 cases out 
of7; 57%,) had reported a past history oflgAN. Out of these 4 cases reporting past history of 
IgAN, the TTO to current IgAN was reported in 2 cases as same day and 1 day 
)  respectively.  However,  possible  confounders  such  as  concurrent  UTI,  and 
Crohn's  disease  were  also  identified.  A  co-morbidity  of Henoch  Schonlein  purpura  was 
,  however  in these two cases possible 
reported in two  cases 
confounders were also identified ( eg, Crohn' s disease, use of benzathine penicillin suggesting 
a systemic infection). 
The latency of the presenting symptom of igAN (or to the diagnosis ofigAN) to COVID-1 9  
vaccine administration was reported in 10 out o f  1 3  cases and all 10 cases were reported 
following first vaccine dose. In majority of the cases (6 out of 1 3  cases), the TTO of vaccine 
administration to the presenting symptom of IgAN ( or to the diagnosis of IgAN) ranged 
between 0-3 days 
was 
. In 1  case, there was concurrent IgA vasculitis 
, 
. This short TTO may be possibly explained by innate non-specific immunity 
or pre-existing disease pathogenesis rather than adaptive immunity to vaccine. In 3 out of 
these 6 cases, possible confounders for IgAN could be identified such as concurrent 
infections (UTI, use ofbenzathine penicillin) and renal cyst 
. In one case, although both vaccine doses were administered, there were no 
similar complaints of recurrence and /or worsening after second dose

In view of reasonable TTO but limited insufficient information on exact clinical course of 
IgAN, diagnostic and etiological work up and corrective treatment, the assessment as per 
WHO-UMC scale for V AXZEVRIA was considered as Possible with limited information in 
. In one case, although the TTO was 
reasonable, the event of IgAN could also be explained by concurrent infection and hence 
considered Possible with confounders identified 
In the 1 case, the TTO to 
clinical suspicion oflgAN was 284 days, however it was reported that the patient had been 
given subsequent doses of COVID-1 9  vaccine but there was no information on vaccine types 
. In the remaining 4 cases, although confounder for 
and vaccination dates 
IgAN were identified (such as concurrent influenza with oropharyngeal pain, concurrent 
chronic kidney disease, medical history oflgAN in the backdrop of pre-existing Crohn's 
disease), based on insufficient information on TTO a comprehensive causal assessment was 
not possible. In summary, on cumulative review of 1 3  cases pertaining to IgA nephropathy, 
based on insufficient case details ( on medical history, concomitant medications, etiological 
work-up) for a comprehensive causal assessment or based on confounders, there is 
unsubstantiated evidence to support a causal relationship of IgA nephropathy to 
VAXZEVRIA.

Search results during the reporting period: 
The search identified a total of 90 relevant abstracts comprising 65 published case reports / 
series, 1 5  conference abstracts (with limited study details such as baseline characteristics, full 
statistical analysis plan), and 10 observational studies or reviews in the reporting period of 
the PBRER (29 December 202 1 to 28 Jun 2022). 
Out of the 90 articles, 56 concerned mRNA Covid-1 9  vaccines, 1 3  concerned multiple 
COVID-1 9  vaccines [including V AXZEVRIA (n=5)], 10 concerned vector based vaccines 
and 5 concerned inactivated COVID-1 9  vaccine. Of the 19 IgA Nephropathy articles, 1 5  
concerned mRNA covid-1 9  vaccines, 3 concerned to multiple COVID-1 9  vaccines and 1 was 
reported to inactivated COVID-1 9  vaccine. All but one article were case reports or case 
series. Three relevant articles with an observational controlled study design and consensus 
review is summarized in Table 98 below:

Until the end of December 2021, 45 cases oflgAN, 36 cases ofMCD,  Although a temporal association was reported in the cases, there is 
20 of AA V, 1 1  of membranous nephropathy, 7 of anti-GBM-disease

Most IMKD relapsed/flared were diagnosed after the second dose of 
the COVID-19 vaccine, with the exception ofMCD, which was 
usually found after the first dose. 
These findings warrant confirmation in independent cohorts, but the 
benefits of vaccination far outweigh this small, theoretical risk. 
Rechallenge on heterologous vaccine dosing was also seen. 
Most disease onset or relapse/flare of immune-mediated kidney disease 
can be successfully treated in a standard manner. 
Overall conclusion as per author 
Patients with immune-mediated kidney diseases should be prioritized 
to receive booster doses according to national implementation as early 
as possible, as reduced vaccine response is anticipated in many cases. 
Reported side effects (including recurrence of disease or de novo 
glomerulonephritis) are rare and large population-based investigations

COVID-19 vaccines clearly outweigh the potential risks. 
Study type: 
Longitudinal design, single centre 
Objective: 
Longitudinal follow-up of patients with pre-existing biopsy confirmed 
IgA nephropathy or IgA vasculitis nephritis who received a COVID-19 
vaccination, in a single hospital centre in Peking. 
Results: 
A total of 202 patients with IgAN or IgA vasculitis nephritis received 
at least 1-dose vaccination and had blood and urine tests within 3 
months before and after vaccination. 
There was no significant difference between the baseline and 
postvaccination proteinuria (0.59 [interquartile range, 0.30- 0.98] vs. 
0.54 [0.33---0.92] g/d; P = 0.52) and hematuria (25.1 [8.9- 72.2] vs. 25.4 
[9- 59.2]/ml; P = 0.47). 
Estimated glomerular filtration had a mild but statistically significant 
difference (68.39 [23.18] vs.  67.33 [23.53] ml/min per 1 .73 m2; P -
0.03) from prevaccination to postvaccination. 
Overall conclusion as per author 
Overall, the absolute incidence of adverse  events was low, and 
COVID-19 vaccine was well tolerated in patients with IgAN, 
especially to those having relatively stable disease. Although 
glomerular filtration rate decline was observed in a few patients, the 
change was temporary.

Patients with pre-existing IgAN or IgA vasculitis nephritis 
although had perturbation in renal parameters, however, did not 
show any statistically difference in renal parameters post-
vaccination compared to pre-vaccination. The limitation of this 
study are that it is a single centre study, undertaken with 
inactivated COVID-19 vaccines with limited information on 
vaccine efficacy parameters. Hence, an extrapolation of study

Potential Mechanism of action 
The various mechanisms hypothesized by the authors for glomerulonephritis and nephrotic 
syndrome were: 
•  Abnormal T cell mediated glomerular damage (Leclerc et al 202 1 ,  Biradar et al 2022, Neves 
et al 2022, Schaubschlager et al 2022, Timmermans et al 2022) 
For the mechanism of abnormal T cell mediated glomerular damage, the authors 
referenced to mouse models of nephrotic syndrome wherein imbalance in T-cell, 
especially circulating CD8+ T suppressor cells aggravates nephrotic syndrome by 
directly inducing foot process infusion (Wang et al 200 1 ;  van den Berg and Weening 
2004). As per the authors, V AXZEVRIA also has the potential to stimulate CD8+ T 
cells and the resultant Th2-type responses can potentially cause immunological adverse 
effects (Bordon 202 1 ). Neves et al 2022 proposed the role of V AXZEVRIA induced 
innate immune stimulation ( especially interferons) which in turn would amplify T cell 
mediated podocytopathy. This would also explain the short latency after COVID-1 9  
vaccination. This mechanism was also proposed for mRNA vaccine (Bomback et al 
2021) 
•  B cell pathway mediated podocytopathy (Timmermans et al 2022) 
For the mechanism ofB cell pathway mediated podocytopathy, in the case series 
presented by Timmermans et al 2022), there was also evidence seen for polyclonal IgG 
deposits but no electron deposits on kidney biopsy 
•  Molecular mimicry between SARS CoV-2 spike protein and self-antigens on the podocytes 
(Leclerc et al 202 1) - the self-antigens were unspecified 
•  Aberrant activation of the immune system in predisposed individuals (Leclerc et al 202 1) 
For the mechanism of Aberrant activation of the immune system in predisposed 
individuals, as per Leclerc et al 202 1, because IFN pathways have an important role in 
the pathogenesis of CG, notably in patients homozygous for APOLl high-risk variants, 
their stimulation by SARS-CoV-2 immunization could be a potential second-hit 
triggering CG development, especially among genetic susceptible patients 
Specific mechanisms for IgA Nephropathy 
•  anti-glycan  antibodies  that  cross-react  with  pre-existing  under- galactosylated  IgAl 
(Abramson et al 202 1 ;  Kudose et al, 202 1 ;  Park et al 202 1 ;  Roberts 2021) and increase of 
pathogenic IgA production post vaccination similar to the influenza vaccine (Abramson et 
al 202 1 ;  Carr et al 202 1 ;  Farooq et al 202 1 ;  Li NL et al 202 1 ;  Nihei 2022; Negrea and Rovin 
202 1 ;  Wu et al 2021) 
For the proposed mechanism of increase of pathogenic IgA production post 
vaccination, Nihei 2022 provided a chronologic correlation of increased IgAl levels 
with clinical symptoms in a single case report with a mRNA vaccination. It was 
observed that the urine Gd-IgAl level was highest at the onset of gross hematuria. For 
the proposed mechanism of mRNA based production of aberrant glycosylated IgA via 
Toll-like receptors (TLRs) signalling, Matsuzaki et al, 2021 provided reference to 
previous studies (mechanism based studies in animals) which demonstrated the

association with TLR9with single-stranded Deoxyribonucleic Acid (DNA) containing 
unmethylated CpG motifs, and the synthesis of these IgA (Suzuki et al, 2008; Makita et 
al, 2020). Zheng et al, 2020 recently showed that TLR7, which recognizes endogenous 
or exogenous single-stranded RNAs is also involved in the production of aberrantly 
glycosylated IgA l ,  indicating that there might be some link between TLR signalling 
and the pathogenesis oflgAN. 
•  robust T-helper and B cell response in the germinal centre by mRNA vaccination (Abramson 
et al 202 1 ;  Chan et al 2022) 
•  subclinical IgAN becoming apparent (Abramson et al 2021 ;  Acharya et al 202 1 ;  Chan et al 
2022) ; Fujita et al, 2022; Hanna et al, 202 1 ;  Klomjit et al 202 1 ;  Lo and Chan 2021) 
For the proposed mechanism of subclinical IgAN becoming apparent after COVID-1 9  
vaccination, Klomjit et al 2021 explored it further on a previously preserved 
nephrectomy sample (preserved at the time of diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma) and it 
revealed evidence of pre-existing subclinical IgAN. Although this is a unique case, 
further studies will be required to explore the possibility of presence of subclinical 
IgAN in patients manifesting with new-onset IgAN post COVID-1 9  vaccination. 
Rahim et al 2021, Klomjit et al 202 1 presented cases of inconsistent IgAN relapses to 
multiple previous vaccinations to the current mRNA COVID-1 9  vaccination 
(inconsistently seen with annual influenza vaccinations or other previous 
vaccinations). Also, in the longitudinal follow up of 202 patients with pre-existing 
IgAN, Zan et al 2022 did not observe any significant increase in renal parameters, 
post COVID-1 9  vaccination. Although different vaccines (Influenza vaccine, Shingrix 
vaccine, mRNA COVID-1 9  vaccine) may have common excipients ( eg, Polysorbate 
80), due to inconsistent association of relapse of lgAN or IgA pathology with various 
vaccines, extrapolation of results of one vaccine to others cannot be comprehensively 
done. 
•  potent  stimulation  of immune  response  from  mRNA-based  vaccine  compared  to  other 
vaccines (Abramson et al 202 1 ;  Acharya et al 2021), 
•  stimulation of Gut-associated lymphoid tissue and other mucosa! tissues (Chan et al 2022; 
Hamza and Beers, 2021) or aberrant mucosa! immunity response (Roberts 202 1) 
•  molecular mimicry (Fujita et al, 2022; Kanamori 2022) 
•  delayed type hypersensitivity (Rahim et al 202 1 ;  Plasse et al 2021) 
•  systemic cytokine-mediated flare (Kudose et al, 202 1 ;  Park et al 202 1) 
•  mRNA  based  production  of aberrant  glycosylated  IgA  via  Toll-like  receptors  (TLRs) 
signalling (Matsuzaki et al, 2021 ). 
AstraZeneca Comments: The review of mechanisms proposed by the authors included both 
vaccine type specific and vaccine non-specific mechanisms. For IgAN, the mechanism of 
presence of subclinical IgA pathology was explored further, however,  an inconsistent 
association of IgAN flare/reactivation with patient receiving multiple vaccine types was 
observed.  The remaining mechanisms are hypothesis and further evidence on the pathway or

mediators leading to the glomerular injury are lacking.  Thus, there is insufficient 
comprehensive evidence for a conclusive mechanism for glomerulopathies following 
V AXZEVRIA  vaccination and that evidence from other vaccine types cannot be 
comprehensively extrapolated to all other vaccines. 
Summary 
Overall medical summary of all case reports 
Of the 1 1 5 case reports of Glomerulonephritis AND Nephrotic syndrome (including IgA 
Nephropathy) reported globally and included in AstraZeneca's post-marketing database, the 
TTO was within 42 days for 60 of the case reports that reported TTO. Underlying 
cause/confounding factors were noted in 39 cases (34%) of cases. 
Cases were assessed by age, sex, type of event, and outcome. The characteristics of the 
events and of the individuals with events were as expected for the general population, 
including the observation of increased incidence in the elderly. No unusual trends or clusters 
were identified. None of the cases met WHO-UMC criteria for Certain or Probable/Likely. 
Of the 130 events of Glomerulonephritis AND Nephrotic syndrome (including IgA 
Nephropathy) reported, 1 event of glomerulonephritis proliferative in 1  case (0.8%) was 
reported with fatal outcome cumulatively through 28 June 2022. However, due to insufficient 
information on onset latency of the events, clinical course, etiological workup, renal biopsy, 
autopsy, concomitant medication and corrective therapy, a comprehensive causal assessment 
of the fatal outcome of glomerulonephritis proliferative is not possible. 
Out of 1 1 5 cases, 3 cases reported recurrence / worsening with the PTs of nephrotic 
syndrome, Granulomatosis with polyangiitis and Glomerulonephritis minimal lesion. A 
review of the cases of recurrence / worsening did not identify any specific trends to events, 
vaccine type, onset latency and any patient susceptibility. The recurrence was confounded in 
one case while there was insufficient information on clinical course and concomitant 
medications in the remaining two cases for a comprehensive assessment. 
On review of 66 medically confirmed cases pertaining to Glomerulonephritis AND Nephrotic 
syndrome (including IgA Nephropathy), 40 (61 %) cases were assessed on WHO-UMC 
causality scale as 'Possible' based on temporal association only with confounders identified 
in 1 3  out of 40 cases (33%). Thirteen cases (20%) were assessed as 'Unlikely' based on 
unreasonable time relationship of event to vaccination and presence of alternate explanations. 
The remaining 1 3  cases could not be comprehensively assessed due to insufficient 
information on vaccine latency and clinical course of the event. Seven case reports reported a 
relapse or flare-up of pre-existing glomerulonephritic condition were identified. However, no 
trend was seen on temporal plausibility based on widely varied TTO and some presenting 
only after 2nd vaccination. This also precludes any singular immune mediated hypothesis 
(non-specific or adaptive immune response). Moreover, majority of cases had confounders. 
Additionally, amongst 66 medically confirmed cases pertaining to Glomerulonephritis AND

Nephrotic syndrome (including IgA Nephropathy), 25 (38%) were identified either with 
relevant risk / confounding factors. Overall, the review of medically confirmed cases did not 
raise any new relevant safety information for V AXZEVRIA. 
The 0/E analysis results pertaining to Glomerulonephritis AND Nephrotic syndrome 
(including IgA Nephropathy) showed observed cases to be significantly less than expected 
cases. 
In summary, the review of available data from spontaneous reports regarding 
Glomerulonephritis AND Nephrotic syndrome (including IgA Nephropathy) did not identify 
an index case or other evidence of a new or emerging signal. 
Literature summary: 
An analysis of the three relevant literature articles did not find any evidence of increased 
observed frequency of glomerulopathies compared to expected rates in general population. 
The review of mechanisms proposed by the authors included both vaccine type specific and 
vaccine non-specific mechanisms. However, there was insufficient evidence for a conclusive 
mechanism for glomerulopathies following V AXZEVRIA vaccination and that evidence 
from mRNA vaccine types cannot be comprehensively extrapolated to all other vaccines. 
Conclusion 
Based on the review of the currently available data, AstraZeneca considers that there is 
insufficient evidence to suggest a causal association between V AXZEVRIA and 
Glomerulonephritis AND Nephrotic syndrome (including IgA Nephropathy). It is 
AstraZeneca's opinion that no updates to CDS or RMP are warranted at this time. 
AstraZeneca will continue to monitor safety information for Glomerulonephritis AND 
Nephrotic syndrome (including IgA Nephropathy) as part of routine safety surveillance 
activities and take further actions as deemed necessary.

BACKGROUND 
In the assessment report received from the PRAC EMA 
(EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/0001 0912/202 1 12) for the V AXZEVRIA PBRER (review period 
29 June 2021 - 28 December 2021), further information on the topic ofrhabdomyolysis is 
requested as follows: The MAH is requested to comment on the WHO-UMC identified signal 
of Rhabdomyolysis and to provide a cumulative review of cases reported with  V AXZEVRIA. A 
discussion on the need to update the Pl should be included. Rhabdomyolysis was actively 
monitored in  UMC's signal detection activities for COVID-19 vaccines due to it being 
marked as an adverse event of special interest (AES]).

Rechallenge / Recurrence case reports 
There were no case reports identified for Rhabdomyolysis after the first dose, with a 
recurrence or worsening with the second dose of vaccination indicating potential recurrence / 
rechallenge. 
WHO-UMC causality assessment 
The clinical presentation ofrhabdomyolysis varies, ranging from an asymptomatic increase in 
serum levels of enzymes released from the damaged muscles to severe muscle pain and 
conditions such as hypovolaemia, metabolic and electrolyte abnormalities as well as acute 
kidney injury. Typically, the urine is dark due to the release of myoglobin. Diagnosis is 
confirmed by serum creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels above 1 ,000 U/L or five times 
above the normal upper limit. The thresholds for upper limits of normal CPK-values differ 
for men and women and are considered to range between 39-308 U/L for men and 26-1 92 
U/L for women, with some variation between ethnicities. The elevation of CPK could be 
considered the hallmark ofrhabdomyolysis and usually rises within  12 hours after the onset 
of muscle injury and peaks within one to three days. Other important diagnostic tests include 
serum myoglobin, urinalysis for myoglobinuria and serum electrolyte abnormalities Torres 
PA et al 201 5, Nance JR et al 2015 
After review of 92 case reports ofRhabdomyolysis, in 3 (3.3%) cases the CPK value was less 
than 1000 U/L without reported PT ofRhabdomyolysis, and in 33 (35.9%) cases the CPK 
value was unknown without reported PT ofRhabdomyolysis. Hence, these 36 cases were 
unlikely to meet the case definition ofRhabdomyolysis. 54 (58.7%) case reports were 
reported with PT ofRhabdomyolysis and in 2 (2.2%) case reports the CPK value were more 
than 1000 U/L with PT Muscle necrosis and Myopathy along with additional symptoms of 
muscle pain and muscle weakness. Based on these factors, a total of 56 cases, were 
considered for WHO-UMC causality assessment. 
AstraZeneca considered 56 cases ofRhabdomyolysis for WHO-UMC causality assessment 
using a Risk Window of 1 -42 days which is presented in Table 1 06 below:

*In 1 1  case reports, more than 1 risk factor was reported (6 cases chronic condition + concomitant medications, 
2cases: chronic condition + elderly age: � 80 years and 2 cases chronic condition + suspected COVID-19), 
hence the total is more than 26 
In the remaining 30 (53.6%) out of 56 case reports ofRhabdomyolysis, there was insufficient 
information with respect to either dose latency, medical history or concomitant medication 
details for a comprehensive causal assessment. 
Observed Versus Expected (O/E) Analyses 
In addition to the case review requested, AstraZeneca also conducted an observed versus 
expected analysis for Rhabdomyolysis using cumulative observed cases. The background 
incidence rate (IR) from McKenna MC et al 201 9  has been used for O/E analysis. With 
regards to the Risk Window of 1 -42 days, as there is a lack of specific literature or a 
postulated biological mechanism and/or precedent for investigation of this as a postulated 
Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI), a risk window of 1 -42 days was chosen to 
align with the broad concept of this being a suitable risk window for possible immune­
mediated AEFis (Rowhani-Rahbar A et al 2012). 
An O/E analysis ofRhabdomyolysis was conducted cumulatively through DLP 28 June 2022 
are presented in Table 1 08. The results were provided for 42 days risk windows for all global 
and regional (EU/UK) reports. The background incidence rate (IR) from McKenna MC et al 
201 9  has been used for O/E analysis. 
Conservatively, the exposure for global reports (448306152) is based on doses administered 
in 1 3  markets as explained in Appendix 8.

Observed events were significantly less than the expected events using the Risk Window 
(RW) of 42 days for all global and regional (EU/UK) reports, and also including those events 
with unknown TTO. 
Summary 
Rhabdomyolysis was actively monitored in UMC's signal detection activities for COVID-1 9  
vaccines due to it being marked as an AESI. WHO identified signal ofrhabdomyolysis for 
COVID-1 9  vaccines. 
The incidence ofRhabdomyolysis in general population is unknown. On literature review 
McKenna MC et al 201 9  is concerned with the incidence rate in hospitalised patients. 
Rhabdomyolysis is known to occur naturally at an overall annual incidence of 59 cases per 
1 00,000 persons (McKenna MC et al 2019) per annum. The natural aetiology is multifactorial 
but includes traumatic injury, exertion, medicines, infections and metabolic causes. The 
classic presentation is of muscle pain, weakness, pigmenturia, and a marked elevation of 
serum CPK five to ten times above the upper limit of normal (ULN) serum levels (Chavez L 
0 et al 2016). 
Ninety-two (92) Rhabdomyolysis cases were reported globally and included in AstraZeneca's 
post-marketing database. Cases were assessed by age, sex, type of event, and outcome. The 
characteristics of the events and of the individuals with events were as expected for the 
general population, including the observation of increased incidence in the elderly. No usual 
trends or clusters were identified. The time to onset (TTO) was available in 63 (68.5%) case 
reports and ranged from O days to 266 days (median: 3 days). Of 63 cases, 5 1  (81 .0%) cases 
were within TTO range of 1 -42 days. 
Of92 cases, 54 (58.7%) cases were reported with PT ofRhabdomyolysis and in 2 (2.2%) 
cases the CPK value were more than 1000 U/L with PT Muscle necrosis and Myopathy along 
with additional symptoms of muscle pain and muscle weakness. In 33 cases, Rhabdomyolysis 
was not reported as a PT (with CPK value not stated) and in 3 cases CPK was less than 1000 
U/L without Rhabdomyolysis reported. Hence these 36 cases were unlikely to meet the 
definition ofRhabdomyolysis. Of 92 cases, 56 cases were considered for WHO-UMC 
causality. None of the cases met WHO-UMC criteria for Certain or Probable/Likely. 62.5% 
were considered as Possible, 14.3% were considered as Unlikely, 1 .8% were 
Conditional/Unclassified and 2 1 .4% were considered as Unassessable/Unclassifiable related 
to V AXZEVRIA. Amongst 56 cases, 46.4% were identified with relevant risk/confounding 
factors and 53.6% cases had limited information for a comprehensive causal assessment. 
Of92 cases, there were 4 fatal cases which were assessed as Possible as per WHO-UMC 
causality (3 cases had relevant confounders and 1 case had limited information).

25 August 2022 
The 0/E analysis results for rhabdomyolysis showed observed cases to be significantly less 
than expected for all age and Global and EU/UK reports. 
In summary, the review of available data from spontaneous reports regarding rhabdomyolysis 
did not identify an index case or other evidence of a new or emerging signal. 
Conclusion 
Based on the currently available cumulative data, AstraZeneca considers that there is 
insufficient evidence to suggest a causal relationship between V AXZEVRIA and 
Rhabdomyolysis. It is AstraZeneca's opinion that no update to the CDS or RMP is warranted 
at this time. 
Rhabdomyolysis is an AESI for V AXZEVRIA and will continue to be kept under close 
surveillance by AstraZeneca. AstraZeneca will no longer discuss the topic in future PBRERs, 
unless significant new safety information arises. 
15.2.10  Exacerbation of Diabetes, Adrenal Insufficiency and Hypertension 
Background 
In the assessment report received from the PRAC EMA 
(EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/0001 0912/202 1 12) for the V AXZEVRIA PBRER (review period 
29 June 202 1 to 28 December 202 1), further information on the topic of Exacerbation of 
Diabetes Mellitus ( eDM), Adrenal Insufficiency and Hypertension is requested as follows: 
The MAH is requested to comment on the WHO-UMC identified signal of exacerbation of 
these health issues and provide a cumulative review of cases reported with  V AXZEVRIA. A 
discussion on the need to update the PI should be included. 
15.2.10.1  Exacerbations of type 1/type 2 mellitus diabetes 
A cumulative search till DLP (28 June 2022) of the AstraZeneca Global Safety Database with 
V AXZEVRIA was performed using the following MedDRA Preferred Term(s) (version 
25.0): Diabetes mellitus inadequate control; Diabetes with hyperosmolarity; Diabetic 
hyperglycaemic coma; Diabetic hyperosmolar coma; Diabetic ketoacidosis; PTs related to 
increased blood glucose; Blood glucose fluctuation; Blood glucose increased; Glucose 
tolerance impaired; Glycosylated haemoglobin abnormal; Glycosylated hemoglobin 
increased; Diabetic ketoacidotic hyperglycaemic coma; Diabetic ketosis; Diabetic metabolic 
decompensation; Hyperglycaemic hyperosmolar nonketotic syndrome; Hyperglycaemic 
seizure; Hyperglycaemic unconsciousness; Hyperosmolar state; Ketoacidosis; 
Hyperglycaemia; Increased insulin requirement. 
The search retrieved a total of 1087 cases, of them DM was coded incorrectly in 9 cases, 
which were removed from further analysis. Of the remaining 1078 cases, diabetes mellitus 
(DM) was reported as medical history in 383 cases, these cases are considered to be 
exacerbation ofDM and are further analysed. A total of 409 events of eDM were reported in 
the 383 cases.

The following observations were made from a review of the 409 events in 383 case reports 
pertaining to eDM cumulatively through the DLP (28 June 2022): 
•  Vaccinee age was reported in 346 case reports and ranged from 20 to 89 (mean: 54.5 years; 
median:  57  years).  244  (63.8%)  reports  referred  to  adult  and  1 1 3  (29.4%)  to  elderly 
vacinees, in 26 case reports age group was not available. 
•  Vaccinee gender was reported in 382 case reports. Of these case reports, 233 (60.8%) were 
in female patients and 149 (38.9%) were in male patients. In one (0.3%) case report gender 
was not reported. 
•  1 17 (30.5%) case reports were medically confirmed and 266 (69.5%) were non-medically 
confirmed. 
•  203  (53.0%) of the cases were serious (62  medically confirmed and 141 were consumer 
reports) 
•  Serious  criteria  in  the  203  cases  were  Fatal  12  (5.9%),  Life  threatening  26  (13.2%), 
Hospitalisation 53 (26.0%), Disability 22 (10.8%), and Medically important  1 58  (77.5%). 
An event may have met more than one criteria for seriousness. The remaining 1 80 (46.9%) 
events were non-serious (55 medically confirmed and 125 consumer reports). 
•  Amongst 1 1 8  cases with reported outcome Recovered or Recovered with sequelae, the event 
duration was reported in 43  [36. 1%] cases. The mean duration was 7 days. In 36 (83.7%) 
cases, the  event resolved within 7  days  and  in the remaining  7  (1 6.3%) cases the  event 
resolved between 8 and 77 days after onset. 
•  Of the  total  383  case  reports,  the  time  to  onset  (TTO)  identified  from  V AXZEVRIA 
administration to eDM (0 days) was reported in 348 case reports and ranged from O to 2 1 3  
days (mean: 4.0 days; median:  0 days). Most o f  the cases occurred in the initial 5 days of 
vaccination. This is further presented in the following Table 1 12 accordingly with respect

Of the 12 fatal case reports (eDM) cumulatively till the DLP (28 June 2022), 5 (41 .7%) were 
medically confirmed. Overall, the TTO was reported for 10 of the 12 fatal events and ranged 
from 0 to 213 days after receiving vaccine. The risk window for TTO was considered to be 
between 0 and 7 days, inclusive. Of the 12 fatal case reports the WHO-UMC causality was 
considered possibly related in 5 ( 41. 7%) cases, unlikely related in 5 ( 4 1 .  7%) cases due to 
TTO being outside the risk window, and in 2 (16.7%) cases it was considered to be 
unassessable due to unknown TTO. Diabetic ketoacidosis was reported in all cases assessed 
as possibly related, all the cases contained strong confounding factors: inadequate control or 
compliance in 2 cases, concurrent pneumonia, recently developed circulatory collapse and 
myocardial infarction. All remaining fatal cases also reported confounding factors or 
alternative explanation. In 6 cases fatal outcome was attributed to other events: autoimmune 
encephalopathy, acute cerebrovascular accident and COVID-1 9  pneumonia, myocardial 
ischemia, heart attack, tuberculosis, and to respiratory failure, bacterial pneumonia, ischemic 
stroke and Alzheimer's disease. In the remaining fatal case, the fatal outcome was attributed 
to a number of conditions, including sudden death and type II diabetes mellitus.

Summary 
Overall medical summary of all case reports 
Cumulatively through DLP (28 June 2022), a total of 383 reports of eDM with the use of 
V AXZEVRIA have been received, of which 53.0% of the reported cases were serious and 
46.9% were non-serious.  12 fatal events were reported, all of them were confounded by pre­
existing inadequate control ofDM, or by other strong confounding factors or were not the 
direct cause of death. The age range was 20 to 89 years and mean and median age was 
reported as 54.5 years and 57 years, respectively. More cases were reported for adult patients 
compared to the elderly, 63.8% and 29.4%, respectively, and more cases were reported for 
female that for male vaccinees, 60.8% and 38.9%, respectively. 30.5% of cases were 
medically confirmed and 69.5% were consumer reports. 
Most of the cases were reported after the first dose ofV AXZEVRIA, 280 (73.3%). 1 1  (2.9%) 
cases occurred after the second dose, and none after the third dose. There were no case 
reports identified for eDM after the first dose, with a recurrence or worsening of eDM with 
the second dose of vaccination indicating potential recurrence / rechallenge cumulatively 
through DLP. 
Of the serious cases, the most were medically important, 77.5%, followed by hospitalization, 
26.0%, life threatening, 1 3.2%, disability, 1 0.8% and fatal, 5.9%. 
For eDM, the most common PTs reported were Blood glucose increased (1 66), 
Hyperglycaemia (1 16), Diabetes mellitus inadequate control (48), Blood glucose fluctuation 
(38) and Diabetic ketoacidosis (20). 
The most commonly co-reported events were Pyrexia (25.8%) and Headache (28.4%).

Cumulatively through DLP (28 June 2022) of the 383 case reports, the TTO was reported in 
348 (90.8%) cases. The mean and median TTO was 4.0 days (mean) and 0 days (median) 
respectively. TTO ranged from O to 2 1 3  days, and was unknown in 35 (9. 1  %) case reports .. 
•  Amongst 383 cases received cumulatively through DLP (28 June 2022)  1 1 8  had a reported 
outcome recovered or recovered with sequelae. The majority of the events were reported as 
recovered at time of reporting, and the different case report source was as followed: Clinical 
trial (2);  Spontaneous (377); and Literature (4). Amongst 1 1 88 cases with reported outcome 
Recovered or Recovered with sequelae, the event duration was reported in 43 [36. 1 % ] cases. 
The mean duration was 7.0 days. 
•  For 36 cases (83.7% of the events with reported duration), the events of interest resolved 
within 7 days and for the remaining 7 (1 6.3%) cases the events resolved between 8 and 77 
days after onset. 
•  30.5% of cases were medically confirmed and 69.5% were consumer reports. 
The majority of case reports cumulatively through DLP (28 June 2022), 62.4% contained 
insufficient information to confirm causality assessment. A total of 30.5% of eDM cases 
included relevant risk/confounding factors. 
On further WHO UMC case causality analysis conducted for case reports of eDM, none were 
considered as certain or probable and 10.2% were considered unlikely related to 
V AXZEVRIA. About, 69.5% case reports were assessed as possibly related to 
V AXZEVRIA, however these cases had either limited information or presence alternate 
etiologies. 
Overall, none of the case reports raised any new relevant safety concerns for eDM 
cumulatively till DLP, and we are not aware of any specific biological mechanism through 
which V AXZEVRIA vaccine could cause eDM. 
Discussion and Conclusion 
AstraZeneca was requested to provide a cumulative review on exacerbations of type 1/type 2 
mellitus diabetes in vaccinees who received V AXZEVRIA based on the corresponding signal 
identified by WHO UMC. WHO UMC identified 90 case reports of exacerbation of diabetes, 
that includes 22 cases for V AXZEVRIA. However, lack of information available in the 
reports precluded any conclusions on the impact of the hyperglycaemia exacerbation. The 
report also included cases and case series published in the literature, a hypothetical 
mechanism of such toxicity, and recommendations from medical societies, which contained 
no official recommendations regarding the use of vaccines in patients with diabetes. WHO­
UMC concluded that these findings do not amount to a contraindication ofCOVID-1 9  
vaccination in patients with these conditions. On review o f  the WHO UMC signal report, 
AstraZeneca have found that the report does not contain definitive evidence on causal 
association between V AXZEVRIA and exacerbation of diabetes.

Based on the currently available cumulative data, AstraZeneca considers that there is 
insufficient evidence to suggest a causal relationship between eDM and V AXZEVRIA. It is 
the opinion of AstraZeneca that no changes to the CDS or RMP are warranted at this time. 
AstraZeneca will continue to monitor safety information for eDM as part of the routine safety 
surveillance activities for V AXZEVRIA. AstraZeneca will not discuss the topic future 
PBRERs, unless significant new safety information arises.

Mechanism of action articles review and summary cumulatively through 28 June 2022: 
Zhao and Wu 2022 summarized the influence of COVID-1 9  vaccines on the endocrine 
system and explored the pathogenic mechanisms. The authors hypothesised that 
autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by vaccine adjuvants (ASIA) could be one of 
the possible mechanisms. Adjuvants have been widely used in human vaccines to enhance the 
immune response to vaccination. The authors speculated that in genetically susceptible 
individuals, ASIA may develop by disrupting the immunological balance of the host, by 
molecular mimicry, triggering polyclonal activation ofB lymphocytes or other similar 
etiopathogenetic mechanisms. The authors claim that, previously, type 1 diabetes mellitus, 
primary ovarian failure, adrenal insufficiency, and thyroiditis (mostly subacute thyroiditis) 
have been reported to be related to ASIA syndrome after human papillomavirus, hepatitis B 
virus (HBV), and influenza vaccination. The authors also suggested that, for the COVID-1 9  
vaccines, aluminium salts, emulsions, oils, toll-like receptors, AS0lB, four lipids o f  the 
mRNA vaccine and polyethylene glycol might induce an immune response in susceptible 
individuals. 
AZ Comment: 
ASIA remains a speculative hypothesis and the paper by Zhao and Wu 2022 provides no 
specific new evidence. V AXZEVRIA does not have adjuvants, hence the link to ASIA is

pertaining to a 74-year-old female patient from United Kingdom with 
Of the 129 events of the exacerbation of hypertension, 1 event in a case (0.7%) was reported 
with fatal outcome cumulatively through DLP [28 June 2022]. This non-medically confirmed 
case 
past and current medical history of hypertension, whooping cough, steroid therapy ( for 
recurring chest infections suffered after each vaccine), atherosclerosis, COPD. After 
unknown period of both first and second dose patient experienced lower respiratory tract 
infection, COPD and hypertension. The patient experienced exacerbation of hypertension 
after the first dose, and a recurrence of exacerbation of hypertension with the second dose of 
vaccination indicating potential recurrence / rechallenge. Approximately 4 months after the 
second dose of V AXZEVRIA patient was found dead. The post-mortem concluded she died 
from COPD and high blood pressure. Blood pressure values were not provided. 
AZ Comment: The case lacks adequate information such as time to onset, clinical course, 
baseline general condition and disease control status, compliance to antihypertensive therapy 
around the time of vaccination, serial blood pressure measurements, etc. The event and 
outcome can be attributed to the patient's comorbidities including advanced age, obesity, 
atherosclerosis, and COPD; concomitant medications including unknown steroid and 
antibiotic treatments for recurring chest infections, albuterol and formoterol; concurrent 
lower respiratory tract infection and polypharmacy. WHO-UMC Causality Assessment for 
this case is Unassessable/ Unclassifiable with risk factors/confounders due to lack of 
abovementioned details. 
Rechallenge / Recurrence case reports 
Cumulatively through DLP [28 June 2022], in 1 (0.7%) out of 129 case report, the patient 
experienced exacerbation of hypertension after the first dose, and a recurrence of 
exacerbation of hypertension with the second dose of vaccination indicating potential 
recurrence / rechallenge. This case report was consumer report received from regulatory 
authority. Fatal outcome was present in this case 
cases above. WHO-UMC Causality Assessment for this case is Unassessable/ Unclassifiable

In the remaining 1 9/129 (15%) case reports, there was insufficient information with respect to 
either dose latency, medical history or, concomitant medication or other details for a 
comprehensive causal assessment. 
Literature 
A cumulative literature search through DLP [28 June 2022] of the databases in Embase, 
InsightMeme and PubMed was conducted using the following search criteria: Hypertension 
aggravated; Hypertension exacerbated; Hypertension not adequately controlled; Hypertension 
worsened; Uncontrolled hypertension for V AXZEVRIA 
On using the above search criteria,  12 articles were identified. None of these 12 articles were 
considered relevant for further evaluation and presentation, as they discussed either non­
hypertension related adverse events or mRNA based vaccine events. 
Summary 
Overall medical summary of all case reports 
Cumulatively through DLP (28 June 2022), a total of 129 reports of exacerbation of 
hypertension with the use of V AXZEVRIA have been received, of which 54% were serious 
and 46% were non-serious. The age range was 33 to 94 years and mean and median age was 
reported as 63 years and 63.5 years, respectively. Forty two (42%) of cases were medically 
confirmed and 58% were consumer reports. 
Cumulatively through DLP (28 June 2022) of the 129 cases, the TTO was reported in 105 
(8 1 %) cases. The mean and median TTO was  12 days and 127 days respectively. 
Amongst 129 events received cumulatively through DLP (28 June 2022), 65 (50%) events 
had a reported outcome recovered or recovered with sequelae. 
One event in 129 case reports (0.7%) was reported with fatal outcome cumulatively through 
DLP [28 June 2022], which was non-medically confirmed. There was insufficient 
information on the baseline control status and clinical course of hypertension, and the fatal 
outcome is likely due to the multiple co-morbidities. 
Cumulatively through DLP (28 June 2022), of the 129 case reports reporting the exacerbation 
of hypertension with V AXZEVRIA use, there was 1 (0.7%) case report with potential 
recurrence/rechallenge. 
These 129 case reports received cumulatively through DLP (28 June 2022) were analysed by 
AstraZeneca and found to have limited information (including information on baseline 
control of hypertension, prior/ongoing therapy and treatment information) and/or are 
confounded by alternative aetiologies including the possibility of a concurrent COVID-1 9  
infection.

Upon further WHO-UMC case causality analysis conducted for the 129 case reports, the 
majority of case reports (108 [84%]) were considered possibly related to V AXZEVRIA. 
However, 95 of these  108 (88%) case reports also demonstrated possible risk 
factors/confounders and 1 3  of these 1 08 (12%) cases had limited information to confirm 
causality assessment. 
Literature summary: 
A cumulative literature search through DLP [28 June 2022] of the databases in Embase, 
InsightMeme and PubMed was conducted using the following search terms: Hypertension 
aggravated; Hypertension exacerbated; Hypertension not adequately controlled; Hypertension 
worsened; Uncontrolled hypertension for V AXZEVRIA 
From the above search,  12 articles were identified. None of these  12 articles were considered 
relevant for further evaluation and presentation as they discussed either non-hypertension 
related adverse events or mRNA based vaccine events. 
Literature review cumulatively though 28 June, 2022 did not identify any article elucidating a 
possible pathogenic mechanism leading to exacerbation of hypertension with V AXZEVRIA. 
Conclusion 
Based on the currently available data, AstraZeneca considers that there is currently 
insufficient evidence of a causal association between Exacerbation of hypertension and 
V AXZEVRIA.It is AstraZeneca's opinion that no changes to the CDS or RMP are warranted 
at this time .. AstraZeneca will continue to monitor safety information for Exacerbation of 
hypertension as part of the ongoing safety surveillance activities for V AXZEVRIA. 
AstraZeneca will not discuss the topic future PBRERs, unless significant new safety 
information arises. 
15.2.11  Post-Authorisation Measure LEG 103: Review of pulmonary embolism 
(PE), coronary artery disease (CAD) including myocardial infarction 
(MI) and venous and arterial thromboses - Further data provision 
Following submission of the EMA LEG procedure (Post-Authorisation Measure LEG 103) 
PRAC requested that the following data should be included in this PBRER: 
1 .  A review of the literature for new publications on epidemiologic studies of interest 
related to these safety endpoints, including a presentation of a cumulative overview 
table of all epidemiological studies ( similar to table 1 7  of the assessment report) 
2.  0/E analysis of the safety endpoints using data where age and age/gender stratified 
analysis are possible with reliable estimates of vaccine exposure (ie, UK and EEA 
data). Background rates used should be clearly and explicitly documented, including 
information that may be useful for interpretation: countries, databases, time period, 
population. The MAH should discuss the comparability between the populations and 
systems that give rise to the observed and expected cases and discuss potential biases 
giving limitations in the comparability. If the source comes from a systematic

Arterial thrombosis (ATE), ischaemic stroke (IS) and myocardial infarction (MI): 
Six studies assessed the association between V AXZEVRIA and MI. Three (Berild et al, 2022,; 
Bum et al 2021a; Rahman et al, 2022) found no association and two (Bum et al 2021b; 
Whiteley et al 2022) found there was a decreased risk and only one study found an increased 
risk of MI post vaccination (Botton et al 2022). 
Seven studies assessed the association between V AXZEVRIA and IS (Table 123). Four found 
no statistically significant associations (Rahman et al, 2022, Hippisley-Cox et al 2021 ,  Botton 
et al 2022, Bum et al 2021 b) and two studies found a decreased risk Whiteley et al 2022, Bum 
et al 2021a) and one found an increased risk oflS post vaccination (Berild et al, 2022). 
Six studies assessed the association between V AXZEVRIA and ATE (table 123). Two studies 
found no association (Hippisley-Cox et al 202 1 ;  Bum et al 2021 b ). Two studies found a 
decreased risk (Whiteley et al 2022, Bum et al 2021a) and two studies found an increased risk 
of ATE post vaccination (Berild et al, 2022, Chen et al, 2022), one of the studies was a meta­
analysis assessing all viral vector vaccines (Chen et al, 2022). 
Based on these varied results AstraZeneca cannot draw any conclusions on an association 
between V AXZEVRIA vaccination and arterial thrombosis, IS or MI. 
Venous thromboembolism (VTE), pulmonary embolism (PE) and Cerebrovascular 
venous and sinus thrombosis (CVST): 
Four studies assessed the association between V AXZEVRIA and CVST (Table 123), one of 
which reported a statistically significant association (Hippisley-Cox et al 2021 ). Five studies 
assessed the association between V AXZEVRIA and PE, two of which found no association, 
one reported a decreased risk in those 70 or over, and two found an increased risk after 
V AXZEVRIA vaccination. Eleven studies assessed the association between V AXZEVRIA 
and VTE, two reported no statistically significant association and one reported a decreased 
risk in those 70 or older, one reported a decreased risk for those 70-79 and an increased risk 
for woman younger than 50 and eight reported an increased risk after V AXZEVRIA 
vaccination. 
The majority of the studies assessing the association between V AXZEVRIA and VTE did 
report an association between exposure to AZD1222 and an increased risk ofVTE. The 
associations were found in both SCCS studies that compare post vaccination time to control 
time in those with the outcome, and cohort studies using non-vaccinated or historical controls. 
In the studies that presented results stratified by sex and age the increased risk was higher, or 
only present in younger age groups and in women (Andrews et al 2022; Corrao et al, 2022). 
Relative risks by sex and age group can be found in Appendix 2, for the studies where they 
were available. The highest relative risk was found in Laporte et al 2021, who found those

vaccinated with V AXZEVRIA had 3 .68 times higher risk of VTE compared to historical 
controls. This study only adjusted for sex and age, and did not exclude participants with 
history of study outcomes, making confounding likely. Other studies reported between a 10% 
( corresponding to 66 excess case per 1 million vaccinations, Hippisley-Cox et al 2021 )  and a 
2.43 times increased risk ( corresponding to 23,207 citizens vaccinated per one harmful event 
among women <50, Corrao et al, 2022) and a risk difference of 8.35 cases (95% CI 0.21 to 
1 6.49) ofDVT per 1 00 000 vaccinations in frontline health care personnel consisting mainly 
of younger women (Hviid et al, 2022). Though residual confounding may still be present in 
the studies reviewed, a suggestion of a modest potential association between V AXZEVRIA 
and VTE, especially in younger women, requires further review of new evidence. 
Observed Versus Expected Analysis 
Background rates for 0/E analysis 
The background rates for VTE, ATE and CAD were obtained from the ACCESS study (see 
Appendix for details about the ACCESS rates)., a random-effect meta-analysis was performed 
using the ACCESS rates from the Danish (DCE-AU), Spanish (BIFAP, FISABIO, SIDIAP), 
Italian (ARS), Netherlands (PHARMO) and the United Kingdom (CPRD) Registries. The 
rates for CVA came from the literature and PE rates were from MarketScan 201 9  (see 
appendix for more details). 
Updated OE analyses are provided in appendix 9. 
Sensitivity graphs are also provided in Appendix 9 so that results can be considered for when 
background incidence rates or reporting fractions are reduced. 
Arterial thromboembolism (A TE) 
The O/E analysis results for A TE without thrombocytopenia (TCP) showed observed cases to 
be significantly less than expected for all stratifications and all risk windows. 
When considering the sensitivity graphs in Appendix 9 for global reports, when the 
background incidence rate was reduced to the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval, 
observed cases are still less than expected. 
Venous thromboembolism (VTE) 
The O/E analysis results for VTE without thrombocytopenia showed observed cases to be 
significantly less than expected for all stratifications and all risk windows.

Coronary Artery Disease including Myocardial Infarction 
The O/E analysis results for Coronary Artery Disease including Myocardial Infarction showed 
observed cases to be either less or significantly less than expected for all stratifications and for 
all risk windows except for Females aged 1 8-29 years in the UK for risk windows 21  and 28 
days, when cases with unknown time to onset were included, where observed cases were more 
than expected. This result was not significant however, and the case numbers for these 
stratifications were small. 
When considering the sensitivity graphs in Appendix 9, for global reports, when the

either less or significantly less than expected for all stratifications, except for females 1 8  to 39 
years of age in the UK (risk window 21), and, 28, and 42 days (when unknown TTO was 
included), females in UK 40-49 years (risk window 21  days when unknown TTO included), 
and male 1 8-39 years (risk window 21 days when unknown TTO was included) where 
observed cases were more than expected. This result was only significant for females 1 8-39 
(risk window 21 days), females 30-39 (risk window 28 days) and females 40-49 (risk window 
21 days), and then only when cases with unknown TTO were included. It should be noted that 
results including unknown TTO potentially may overestimate the number of relevant cases. 
In the previous EMA LEG response the O/E analysis results for CV A without 
thrombocytopenia showed observed cases to be either less or significantly less than expected 
for all stratifications, except for females 30 to 39 years of age in the UK where observed cases 
were more than expected. However, the result was not statistically significant.

Limitations of the O/E analysis 
The O/E analyses provided is based on the most recent and available data but there is a level 
of assumption made and any change in the data would impact the results. The following are 
some of the limitations/assumptions of the data used: 
•  Doses administered for determination of exposure: Currently only exposure data from 
certain countries are available, but these countries generate the majority of cases reported 
to AstraZeneca. 
•  The background incidence rate used for the calculation is the same as the population 
vaccinated: The identification of incidence rates can vary depending on the source of the 
data. 
•  The number of observed events is spontaneously reported: Spontaneously reported events 
may only represent a fraction of the events that have actually occurred. Both under­
reporting for certain events, and conversely, over-reporting for certain events may be a 
factor. 
•  The risk period reflects the period of time an event would occur post- vaccination: 
Over-estimating the risk window would increase the Person-Years at Risk period and 
include events that are outside the actual period of time a true event would occur. 
Under-estimating the risk window will result in reduced sensitivity making it difficult to 
reach statistical significance. 
The OE analyses does not account for confounding/risk factors which might be present in the 
cases, such as seasonal effects on the occurrence of certain events, or for example the effect of 
COVID which may also contribute. 
Under-reporting in the context of O/E analysis 
Regarding the results of O/E analysis, the PRAC assessor commented that it might be useful 
to explore the level of under-reporting, which might have impacted the results: 
AZ comment: 
O/E analysis is a signal detection tool which is inherently associated with a range of 
uncertainty and requires certain assumptions and sensitivity analyses to be applied. The most 
significant area of uncertainty for any O/E analysis based on passive surveillance is the level 
of under-reporting of suspected ADRs. The level of under-reporting, as a general rule, is likely 
to be highly variable across products, over time, across regions and is also subject to 
influences such as publicity and awareness of a given safety topic. Although several studies 
have been performed to evaluate and quantify the level of spontaneous under-reporting to

different pharmacovigilance systems, such as the study by Backstrom et al (2004) quoted in 
the PRAC AR which found 86% under-reporting of possible drug-induced thromboembolic 
events, it is very unlikely that any single estimate of under-reporting fraction can be applied to 
any given situation or safety topic, as this is likely to be variable across time and across 
countries/systems. To take one example that is relevant to the current pandemic situation, in 
the 2009/10 swine flu pandemic 14 cases of Guillain Barre Syndrome were reported to the UK 
MHRA as suspected AD Rs within 6 weeks of Pandemrix vaccine, which signaled an 0/E 
excess at every under-reporting fraction, except 0% (ie, assuming 100% reporting) (see 
Swine_ flu_ vaccines_ and_ antiviral_ medicines_ UK _post-pandemic_ safety _review.pdf 
(publishing.service.gov.uk). A subsequent epidemiological study, which ascertained all 
diagnosed cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) within 6 weeks of the vaccine in England 
during the same immunisation campaign, identified only 9 GBS cases and no evidence of an 
increased risk following vaccination (Guillain-Barre syndrome and H l N l  (2009) pandemic 
influenza vaccination using an AS03 adjuvanted vaccine in the United Kingdom: self­
controlled case series - PubMed (nih.gov)). This therefore suggested that the reporting fraction 
was, in fact, closer to 1 00%. In that pandemic situation, there was increased awareness in the 
UK amongst health professionals and patients of GBS being a 'potential' risk (based on swine 
flu vaccines used in 1 97 6) which likely contributed to very high reporting rates ( and likely 
over-reporting of unconfirmed GBS). 
It is therefore a possibility that a high level of awareness amongst health professionals and 
patients of the reports of thromboembolic events following V AXZEVRIA vaccination has led 
to higher levels of suspected ADR reporting, and it cannot be assumed that high under­
reporting fractions are necessarily a plausible reflection of the current reality based on past 
surveys of under-reporting for other drugs. However, it is not possible to quantify or estimate 
this to any extent at present and under-reporting is likely to vary across countries and 
pharmacovigilance systems. Therefore, AstraZeneca considers the best approach for 0/E 
analysis, where this is required, is to continue to consider a range of under-reporting fractions 
( as well as conservative background incidences and more refined estimates of stratified 
exposure) as has presented in our 0/E analyses so far, as a way of taking account of the range 
of uncertainty and applying case by case judgement on potential signals. 
This said, it should also be considered that 0/E analysis is a signal detection tool, and such 
analysis is not designed or intended to confirm or quantify any causal associations. It could be 
argued that, as the potential signal of thromboembolic events has already been detected, the 
continuation or extension of 0/E analysis has less value as more robust sources of evidence 
start to emerge and so more evidence-based analysis to further evaluate the signal should be 
considered. Therefore, AstraZeneca considers that ongoing appraisal of the relative strengths 
and weaknesses of the available and emerging pharmacoepidemiological studies on this topic 
should be the focus of continuing review.

Conclusion on O/E analysis 
AstraZeneca 
25 August 2022 
Both embolic and thrombotic events and CAD including MI occur in all ages and are more 
common as age advances. AstraZeneca did not find evidence of a new or emerging signal 
from review of the O/E analysis. 
15.2.12  Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis 
In June 2022, AstraZeneca received the following request from the Therapeutic Goods 
Administration (TGA) to include 'Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis' (ADEM) to Section 
4.4 Special Warnings and Precautions for Use and Section 4.8 Adverse Effects (Undesirable 
Effects) of the Australian Product Information (PI). It was also mentioned that ADEM is a 
very serious, life-threatening condition and while a causal relationship with V AXZEVRIA has 
not been established to date, listing ADEM in the PI would increase awareness of this 
potential reaction, supporting rapid diagnosis and effective treatment. 
The assessment of the risk of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) with 
V AXZEVRIA vaccination included the review of nine cases by the TGA's Medicines and 
Vaccines Investigation and Surveillance (Ma VIS) Section of the Pharmacovigilance Branch 
(PB). Based on the review, TGA (Ma VIS) concluded that there are sufficient safety grounds 
to update the PI for V AXZEVRIA regarding this risk, in particular, the fatal case of a 63-year-
old man 
in AstraZeneca safety database), where it was considered that the 
vaccination was the likely cause of ADEM in this individual given the lack of evidence for 
alternative causes and the short period between vaccination and symptom onset. 
AstraZeneca also received a similar request from Health Canada in June 2022 for assessment 
of ADEM with V AXZEVRIA. It was requested to include analyses of all cases, stratified by 
age, gender, doses administered, time to onset, and any other relevant information along with 
an observed-to-expected analysis including the appropriate risk window and a provision of 
appropriate case definition including a causality assessment. 
ADEM is an acute monophasic demyelinating condition. ADEM is a part of the important 
potential risk - Immune-mediated neurological conditions -presented in the core RMP 
Version? dated 22 February 2022. This AESI is being kept under close surveillance by 
AstraZeneca. As per the section 4.4 (Special warnings and special precautions for use) of the 
current CDS for V AXZEVRIA, very rare events of demyelinating disorders, including GBS, 
have been reported following vaccination with V AXZEVRIA. A causal relationship has not 
been established. As with other vaccines, the benefits and potential risks of vaccinating 
individuals with V AXZEVRIA should be considered. Therefore, the Company conducted a 
review of all data sources available to the Company to evaluate the risk of ADEM with 
VAXZEVRIA.

Background (Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis) 
Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an acute multifocal demyelinating disease 
of the central nervous system (CNS) that typically follows an infectious illness. The 
prototypical disease was 1 st reported in the year 1 790, occurring in a 23-year-old-woman who 
presented with lower-extremity weakness and bladder retention 1 week after a measles rash 
(Croft,  1 969). Later, it became apparent that several different viruses, mainly exanthematous, 
could produce febrile encephalopathy shortly after the infection. 
Risk Factors 
ADEM is an autoimmune disease resulting from para- or post-infectious complications (Croft, 
1969). Between 55% to 86% of pediatric ADEM cases have preceding symptoms of systemic 
viral illness (Cole et al 2019; Pohl et al 2004; Menge et al 2007; Tenembaum et al 2002). A 
known association following vaccine preventable infections was about 1/1000 wild type 
measles or varicella and 1/5000 rubella (Sejvar et al 2007 as cited in Law B 2021  [B]). Only 
proven association with vaccine is with the now unavailable Semple rabies vaccine derived 
from sheep or mouse brains (Sejvar et al 2007; Hemachudha et al 1 987 [A]; Law B 2021  [B]). 
Infections preceding ADEM include: Streptococcus; Borrelia burgdorferi; Legionella; 
Mycoplasma pneumoniae; Tetanus; Salmonella; Measles; Mumps; Rubella; Smallpox; 
Coxsackie; Rabies; Coronavirus; Herpes (herpes simplex virus, human herpesvirus-6, 
varicella zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barre virus, cytomegalovirus (CMV); Influenza A and 
B; Hepatitis A and B; Human T-lymphotropicvirus-1 ;  HIV; Japanese encephalitis virus; 
Dengue virus; Smallpox; Yellow fever; Rickettsia rickettsia; Chlamydia; Pertussis; 
Campylobacter; and Leptospira. Vaccinations preceding ADEM include those for: Measles, 
Mumps, Rubella (MMR); Oral Polio; Rabies (Semple type); Smallpox; Japanese B 
Encephalitis; Hepatitis B; Diphtheria-Tetanus-Polio (DPT); and Influenza (Garg 2003; 
Bennetto and Scolding 2004; Menge et al 2005; Tenembaum et al 2007). 
Manzano et al 2021 in their systematic review analyzed cases of ADEM and acute 
hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis (AHLE) following infection with COVID-1 9. They found 
differences between the reported post-COVID-1 9  ADEM and AHLE cases; morbidity was 
high despite the use of standard ADEM treatments and mortality was common with relatively 
short follow up. Their findings lend plausibility to COVID-1 9  acting as a viral trigger for 
ADEM and AHLE, as has been postulated with other pathogens in the past, including 
coronaviruses (MERS and OC43). 
Epidemiology 
ADEM is an uncommon illness and hence epidemiologic studies are complicated by small 
case series from limited centres. ADEM can occur at any age, with higher frequency in 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY

children than adults. Predominant age of occurrence in children is 5 to 8 years (Hynson et al 
200 1 ;  Tenembaum et al 2002; Anlar et al 2003) and in adults is 19 to 61 years (Schwarz et al 
2001 ). In children, there appears to be no gender predominance (Dale et al 2000; Leake et al 
2004), although some studies have reported a slight male incidence (Murthy et al 2002; 
Tenembaum et al 2002). The diagnosis of ADEM is usually made in the setting of a viral 
illness or vaccination. Hence, the incidence of disease varies with the triggering infectious 
agent. A higher occurrence of ADEM has been described in the winter and spring months in 
small studies, but the illness can occur throughout the whole year (Murthy et al 2002; Leake et 
al 2004). The reported incidence of ADEM in all age groups is about 0. 15 /100 000/year 
(Willame et al 2021). Worldwide distribution of ADEM is unknown, in part because regional 
cases of ADEM are often linked to specific vaccinations. Incidence of ADEM after measles is 
1 :  1 000, vaccination 1 :63 to 1 :300,000, varicella 1 :  10,000, and rubella 1 :20 000 (Gibbons 
1 956; Spillane and Wells  1 964). A recent United States (US) vaccine safety data link study 
found a possible association of ADEM following the tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccine 
(DTaP), but the excess risk was no more than 1 . 16 cases/million vaccine doses administered 
(Baxter et al 2016). 
Clinical Features and Etiopathogenesis 
The clinical course of ADEM is classically monophasic with acute or subacute presentation, 
with most patients (70% to 77%) reporting an antecedent infection or vaccination (Amit et al 
1 986 Hynson et al 2001 ; Tenembaum et al 2002). In children, clinical manifestations of 
ADEM can be pleotropic. Symptoms can range from non-specific, such as malaise and 
fatigue, to fulminant, progressing rapidly to obtundation and coma. In adults, clinical 
manifestations of ADEM are slightly different from the pediatric population. In contrast to 
children, fever (1 5%), meningism (15%), loss of consciousness (19%), and seizures (4%) are 
uncommon (Schwarz et al 2001). Other symptoms and their frequency of occurrence include 
motor (77%), sensory (65%), brainstem (62%), ataxia (38%), spinal (1 5%), and aphasia (8%). 
The median age of onset is 33 (range 1 9  to 61), with slight female predominance (65%) 
(Schwarz et al 2001). 
Diagnosis 
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the imaging of choice for evaluating patients for 
possible ADEM. Since ADEM evolves over several days, initial MRI may be normal if 
performed at the onset of prodromal symptoms (Bennetto and Scolding 2004; Menge et al 
2007). During the progressive course of the disease, T2 MRI sequences show several lesions 
scattered throughout the brain involving both white- and gray-matter structures, such as 
cerebral cortices, thalamus, basal ganglia, brainstem, and cerebellum (Schwarz et al 200 1 ;  
Menge et al 2007). Most lesions show contrast enhancement.

In addition to the brain, spinal cord can also be affected in ADEM, occurring in about 1 1  % to 
28% of cases (Dale et al 2000; Hynson et al 200 1 ;  Tenembaum et al 2002; Anlar et al 2003). 
Spinal cord lesions are typically large and appear edematous on MRI. Often there is a 
predilection for the thoracic cord, but lesions can occur at any level. 
Serial MRI after the initial episode plays a vital role in establishing the diagnosis of ADEM. 
In monophasic ADEM, MRI obtained at least 6 months after the initial episode should show 
resolving lesions and, more importantly, no evidence of any new lesions. Further specificity 
for the diagnosis of ADEM can be obtained by continual MRI follow-up over 2 to 3 years. If 
there is accrual of additional T2 lesions over time, then patients need to be evaluated for 
possible multiple sclerosis. 
The diagnosis of ADEM can only be confirmed by biopsy. The hallmark of ADEM is 
multifocal perivascular inflammation, with infiltration of lymphocytes and macrophages into 
the parenchyma. Adjacent to the areas of inflammation, myelin loss occurs with relative 
axonal sparing. There is proliferation of endothelial cells and fibrin deposits are seen within 
the vascular lumens. Plasma cells and granulocytes are only rarely seen in ADEM. Most 
lesions are seen in the white matter, but gray matter is also involved in many cases (Behan et 
al 1 972, Behan et al 1 973). 
The pathogenesis of ADEM has most resemblance to the animal model experimental 
autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which is an acute monophasic inflammatory 
demyelinating disease induced by immunization of animals with myelin protein products 
(Rivers et al 1 933). Analogous to EAE, in humans, ADEM cases have been observed after 
immunization with Semple rabies vaccine, a live attenuated vaccine that in the past was 
contaminated with rabbit or goat CNS tissue (Hemachudha et al 1 987 [B]). Since EAE is a 
T-cell-mediated disease, as demonstrated by adoptive transfer of the disease through T-cells 
and not through serum factors to recipient animals, it is likely that ADEM is also a 
T-cell-mediated disease by its close resemblance to the EAE model (Paterson 1 960). The 
distinguishing features between the 2 illnesses of encephalitis and ADEM is usually a rather 
abrupt and fulminant course with acute encephalitis as opposed to ADEM, which usually has a 
subacute onset and greater white-matter involvement (Hartung and Grossman 2001). 
Differential Diagnosis for ADEM 
ADEM usually presents with subacute encephalopathy, which has a broad differential. The 
antecedent history, temporal course of the illness, neuroimaging, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) 
analysis, and probably repeat imaging during remission are most important in arriving at the 
diagnosis and excluding other causes of encephalopathy. In the differential diagnosis, 
conditions to consider and rule out relevant to treatment and prognosis are multiple sclerosis 
and neuromyelitis optica (NMO); vascular strokes; cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy 
with sub-cortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy; amyloid angiopathy; posterior reversible

syndromes, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes (Hartfield et al 1 999; Suwa et al 1999). 
Treatment and Prognosis 
Due to rarity of ADEM, acute presentation, and urgency of treatment, no clinical trials of 
therapeutic agents have been systematically studied. Treatment of choice is high-dose 
glucocorticoid administered systemically for 3 to 5 days, followed by an extended oral steroid 
taper over 6 to 8 weeks. Recrudescences are fewer when this regimen is employed compared 
to a short steroid taper, strongly suggesting a benefit from glucocorticoid treatment, as might 
be expected for a T-cell-mediated process. A good response to therapy has been observed in 
most studies (Wang et al 1 996; Apak et al 1 999; Schwarz et al 2001 ; Tenembaum et al 2002). 
There are cases of ADEM or even fulminant presentation such as acute hemorrhagic 
leukoencephalitis (AHL), where steroids alone are not sufficient for suppressing inflammation 
and improving clinical findings. Plasma exchange, intravenous immunoglobulin (Ivlg), and 
immunosuppressive drugs have been used with some success (Seales and Greer 1 99 1 ;  Stricker 
et al 1 992; Rodriguez et al 1 993; Markus et al 1 997; Pradhan et al 1999; Sahlas et al 2000). 
Plasma exchange or intravenous lg is usually the 2nd step in recalcitrant cases. Of the 
immunosuppressive agents, cyclophosphamide has been more often used in ADEM after 
steroid failure. Its use is rather reserved, often as a 3rd-line agent after inadequate response 
from plasma exchange or intravenous lg. 
The prognosis of ADEM has significantly improved from former times. This is probably due 
to a drastic decrease in wild-type measles infections and the use of safer and more efficient 
vaccinations. Also, there is a widespread use of steroids once ADEM is diagnosed, which has 
been found to be beneficial in limiting clinical symptoms. Full recovery occurs in many 
patients and improvement with minor residual symptoms occurs in up to 70% to 90% of 
patients (Shahar et al 2002; Gupte et al 2003; Menge et al 2005). However, mortality from 
ADEM may still be as high as 5%. This may be the case particularly in patients with more 
ominous clinical presentation, such as those with infratentorial lesions and large spinal cord 
lesions. In the case of AHL, the mortality can be as high as 50% (Borlot et al 201 1 ). A greater 
percentage of pediatric patients recover completely from ADEM compared to adults (60% to 
80% versus 46%, respectively), implying greater recovery potential of the developing CNS in 
children (Schwarz et al 2001).

Biological Plausibility 
AstraZeneca 
25 August 2022 
Several theories have been postulated to explain how infections or vaccinations prime T-cell 
responses against myelin antigens in the CNS such as molecular mimicry (Fujinami and 
Oldstone 1 985), bystander activation of naturally occurring autoreactive T-cells by 
"superantigens" (Burns et al 1 992; Jorens et al 2000), or inhibition of suppressor 
T-lymphocytes (Sakaguchi et al 1 995; Grant et al 2008), and activation of previously primed 
immune cells through reinfection (Merkler et al 2006). It is likely that more than one immune 
mechanism is involved in triggering ADEM in susceptible patients. However, more 
comprehensive studies need to be carried out worldwide in order to understand fully the 
epidemiology of ADEM, as it may be relevant to shedding light on triggering factors, 
pathogenesis of the disease, and possibly preventive measures (Javed and Khan 2014). The 
Institute of Medicine (IOM) reviewed evidence for a link between MMR, VZV, influenza, 
hepatitis A/B, human papillomavirus, DTaP, meningococcal vaccines, and ADEM and 
concluded evidence was inadequate to accept or reject a causal relationship (IOM 201 1). They 
noted that immune mediated mechanisms included autoantibodies, T-cells, and molecular 
mimicry (IOM 201 1). An updated review of evidence published since the 201 1  IOM report for 
the same vaccines had a similar conclusion to IOM regarding no evidence to accept/reject 
causality (Dudley et al 2020). 
Risk Window 
The recommended risk window for ADEM as a vaccine product-related reaction (Rowhani­
Rahbara et al 2012 as cited in Law B 202 1  [B]) for inactivated or subunit vaccines is 2 to 
42 days. 
Clinical Studyand Pre-clinicalStudy DataLive attenuated vaccines: this should be based on the 
incubation period for the vaccine strain, adding as above, 5 to 28 days for primary analysis 
and 2 to 42 days for secondary analysis following the end of the incubation period. 
A search was conducted in the AstraZeneca Clinical database for adverse event (AE) reports 
with a Preferred Term (PT) of ' Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis' (MedDRA 
version 23. 1) following use of AZD1222 (data cut-off of 30 July 202 1 for the US 
Study D8 1 1  0C0000 1 ;  data cut-off of 07 December 2020 for the Oxford pooled studies). 
There were no AEs of 'Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis' reported in the AstraZeneca 
US Study (D8 1 10C00001) and in the Oxford pooled studies (COV00l ,  COV002, COV003, 
and COV005).

No ADEM-related safety findings were identified in the in vitro or in vivo non-clinical studies 
with AZD1222. 
AstraZeneca Global patient Safety Database 
A cumulative search up to 28 June 2022 of the AstraZeneca Global Patient Safety Database 
for the of PT 'Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis' with V AXZEVRIA was performed 
using MedDRA version 25.0. 
The cumulative search retrieved a total of 83 events of ADEM in 83 cases in vaccinees who 
received V AXZEVRIA. Of the 83  cases, 3 cases 
and 
were found to be duplicates and, therefore, not included for further review, 
resulting in a total of 80 serious cases. During the reporting period of the PBRER (29 
December 2021 - 28 June 2022) a total of 37 events of ADEM in 37 cases ofV AXZEVRIA 
were received.

•  All the 80 events pertaining to ADEM was serious with the event seriousness was considered 
as follows: medically important event 45 (56.3%), 15 (18.8%) events resulted in disability, 
46  (57.5%)  events  required  hospitalization,  1 3   (16.3%)  events  were  considered  life 
threatening,  and  5 (6.3%)  events  resulted  in  death.  Note  that  some  events  reported  > 1 
seriousness criteria. 
•  Eighteen out of 80 cases(22.5%) had information on anti-MOG antibody status. Of the  1 8  
cases, 8 (44.4%) cases were anti-MOG positive, 9 (50%) cases were anti-MOG negative and 
in 1 case (5.6%) the anti MOG status was unknown. Thus, no specific trend with respect to 
MOG antibody positive status ADEM in individuals vaccinated with V AXZEVRIA was seen 
on review of safety database. 
•  Of the  80 events, outcomes were reported in 27 (33.8%) events as resolved or resolving, 
2 (2.5%) events as recovered/resolved with sequelae, 25 (3 1 .3%) events as not recovered/not 
resolved, 5 (6.3%) events as fatal, and the remaining 21 (26.3%) events as unknown or not 
reported. 
•  A trend analysis was performed for reporting rates  of ADEM events per million doses  of 
V AXZEVRIA administered in the UK, EU, Brazil, Canada, and Australia (as monthly dose 
administration data is available from these countries; Figure 2). Event rate over time was 
calculated based on the case onset date which was available in 57 out of 80 cases, and the 
remaining  cases unknown  onset  date  were  excluded  from  reporting  rate  calculation.  On 
review of reporting rate trends of ADEM post V AXZEVRIA vaccination, a peak which was 
seen in the months  of March to April and November to December of 202 1 .  However, the 
peak vaccine exposure was  seen  in the  months  of May and  June  of 202 1 .  The  peaks  of 
reporting  rate  of ADEM  could  be  considered  to  be  more  coinciding  with  COVID-1 9  
pandemic peaks, especially in Europe, south-east Asia and Western Pacific (WHO COVID-
1 9  Dashboard), rather than coinciding with trends in vaccine exposure, although this is not a 
direct comparison. Additionally, the observed increase in reporting rates in November and 
December, 2021 could be possibly explained by emergent strains in circulation and onset of 
winter season.

were mentioned in the TGA 
request. Of these 9 cases, 6 fulfilled the BCC level  1 to 3 criteria and are presented in below. 
The remaining 3 cases were assessed as BCC level 4 and BCC level 5. Four of the 9 cases 
were assessed as "Possible" using the World Health Organization-Uppsala Monitoring Centre 
(WHO-UMC) causality assessment criteria (3/4 had limited information [such as medical 
BCC level 2] had 
history, comorbidities, or investigations]; and 1/4 case 
confounders such as Bickerstaff encephalitis, GBS, presumed sepsis and treatments with 
succinyl choline and midazolam). Two of the nine cases were assessed as "Unlikely" as these 
occurred outside the risk window of ADEM. The remaining 3/9 cases were assessed as 
"Unassessable" or "Unclassifiable" as the TTO was unknown; in which 1/3cases 
was classified as BCC level 4 using the BCC criteria for ADEM. 
ADEM cases by BCC 
The Brighton collaboration criteria (BCC) (Law B 2021  [B]) was used for the case level of 
certainty assessment based on the data available in the cases. The strongest level of certainty 
was 1 ,  with levels of certainty 2 and 3 being less strong. Level of certainty 4 was reached for 
cases where the diagnosis was named but not supported with history, clinical findings, clinical 
course or diagnostic tests. Level of certainty 5 was the designation for cases where another 
diagnosis was noted. Based on this approach, of the 80 cases, 3 cases fulfilled level  1 criteria, 
26 cases fulfilled level 2 criteria, 5 cases fulfilled level 3 criteria, 27 cases fulfilled level 4

COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOxl -S [recombinant]) 
AstraZeneca 
25 August 2022 
Of the 3 cases, 1  case was reported in female vaccinee, 1  case was reported in a male vaccinee 
and in  1 case the gender was unknown. The ages of the vaccinees were 45, 49 and 63 years. 
The TTO for the 3 cases were the same day (dose 1),  12 days (dose 1), and 21 days (dose 2). 
The outcome in 1 case was fatal; however, the fatality was confounded by pre-existing 
ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, recurrent vertiginous and non-vertiginous dizziness 
and diabetes. In the remaining 2 cases, the outcome was recovering. Of the 3 cases fulfilling 
BCC level 1 ,  2 cases were assessed as "Possible" with limited information and 1 case was 
assessed as "Unlikely" per the WHO UMC causality assessment criteria. 
Brighton Collaboration Criteria Level 2 
Twenty-six (26) of the 80 cases fulfilled BCC level 2. The cases fulfilled this classification by 
clinical course, examination features, and confirmatory tests and are presented in Table 1 34.

not recovered in 7 cases, recovered in 2 cases, recovering in 7 cases, and unknown in 8 cases. 
Nineteen (19) cases occurred after the 1 st dose, 2 cases after the 2nd dose, and in 5 cases the 
dose information was unknown. Out of the 26 cases fulfilling BCC level 2, 22 cases were 
assessed as "Possible" as they occurred within the risk window of 2 to 42 days, 2 cases were 
"Unassessable" as the TTO was unknown, and 2 cases were "Unlikely" as they were outside 
the risk window per the WHO-UMC causality assessment criteria. Of the 26 cases, possible 
confounders or alternate explanations could be identified in 9 (35%) cases, which were 
infections (n=3 ;  Borrelia infection, suspected COVID-19, and positive IgG for multiple 
viruses [adenovirus, herpes simplex 1 ,  HHV6, cytomegalovirus, EBV VCA, EBNA, 
parvovirus B19, toxoplasma, and VZV]), autoimmune conditions (n=2; autoimmune 
connective tissue disorder, polymyalgia rheumatica, and hypothyroidism), CNS neoplasm 
(n=l ), Bickerstaff encephalitis and GBS (n=l )  and features suggestive of multiple sclerosis 
(n=2; concurrent optic neuritis and intrathecal IgM synthesis). Seventeen (17) cases had 
limited information regarding medical history or comorbidities, or investigations.

AstraZeneca 
25 August 2022 
Twenty-seven of the 80 cases fulfilled BCC level 4. These cases did not fulfil criteria for a 
level 3, 2 or 1 certainty as there was insufficient information (pertaining to exclusion of 
alternate diagnosis for illnesses such as neoplasm, vascular disorder, infection and toxic/ 
metabolic encephalopathy) to confirm the diagnosis or medical assessment of the case as 
ADEM. Out of the 27 cases 1 7  were assessed as possible, 5 cases were assessed as 
unassessable, and 5 cases were assessed as unlikely per the WHO-UMC causality assessment 
criteria. 
Brighton Collaboration Criteria Level 5 
Nineteen of the 80 cases fulfilled BCC level 5 and, therefore excluded due to an alternative 
diagnosis such as GBS, Neuromyelitis Optica Spectrum disorder (NMOSD), 
microhaemorrhages in brain, MS and infectious encephalitis. Out of the 1 9  cases, 9 were 
assessed as possible, 8 were un-assessable, and 2 were assessed as unlikely per the 
WHO-UMC causality assessment criteria. 
The WHO-UMC causality assessment for all the 80 cases is summarized in Table 1 36.

Of the 80 cases identified, 56 (70%) cases were medically confirmed, all of which were 
serious. The BCC (Law B 202 1  [B]) were used for the review of the data available in these 
cases and WHO-UMC causality was further assessed with a 2 to 42 day risk window. Of the 
56 cases that were medically confirmed, 25 cases met BCC level I to 3 based on clinical 
course, examination features, and confirmatory tests (Table 1 37).

In the remaining 32 (57.1 %) of the 56 cases, there was insufficient information with respect to 
either dose latency, medical history, or concomitant medication details for a comprehensive 
causal assessment. 
Overall, the review of medically confirmed cases did not raise any new relevant safety 
information for V AXZEVRIA. 
Rechallenge/Recurrence Case Reports 
There were no cases identified for ADEM after Dose 1 ,  with a recurrence or worsening of 
ADEM with the Dose 2/Dose 3 of vaccination indicating potential recurrence/positive 
rechallenge. 
Events with Fatal Outcome 
Of the 80 cases of ADEM, 5 cases (6.3%) were reported with a fatal outcome, all of which 
were medically confirmed. The assessment of the fatal events identified is presented in

The case was assessed as BCC level 2 based 
on pattern of initial MRI picture suggestive of 
several lesions scattered throughout the brain 
correlating with acute presentation of 
neurological features, Serial MRI showed 
resolving lesions with no evidence of new 
lesions. However, a comprehensive 
assessment of the fatal ADEM could not be 
made due to insufficient information on the 
complete clinical course especially after 
radiological resolution and discharge of the 
patient, and on any corrective therapy, any 
autopsy, medical history and any etiological 
workup. The WHO-UMC was assessed as 
unlikely based on temporal association. 
The case was assessed as BCC level 4 as there 
was limited information to assess ADEM. 
Additionally, due to lack of autopsy and 
insufficient information on TTO, clinical 
course, any corrective therapy, medical 
history, diagnostic workup and any etiological 
workup, a comprehensive causal assessment 
was not possible

The case was assessed as BCC level 4 as there 
was limited information to assess ADEM. 
Additionally, due to the rapid onset on the day 
of vaccination, it is likely a pre-existing 
predisposition to ADEM was present before 
vaccination and the vaccine is unlikely to be 
the cause of the ADEM. Further, no 
information on autopsy, complete clinical 
course, any corrective therapy, medical 
history, diagnostic workup and any etiological 
workup was available.

AZ Comment 
The case was assessed as BCC level I based 
on clinical features, MRI findings, ante 
mortem biopsy and autopsy. Ongoing 
evaluation of pre-existing vertiginous and non­
vertiginous dizziness, (pre-existing foci in 
white matter) and presenting symptom of 
vertigo could also point to possible ongoing 
immune response to an unknown preexisting 
brain pathology. The patient's condition and 
fatality thereof could also be complicated by 
underlying significant cardiac (heart disease 
with ischemic cardiac events) and metabolic 
issues (ketoacidosis and mitochondrial 
dysfunction) as increased lactate levels were 
seen in CSF even post ketoacidosis correction 
with no increased leucocytic pleocytosis. 
There was limited information on post-mortem 
autopsy of other organs. Limited etiologic 
work-up was presented, including infectious 
and cell type assessment on the biopsy sample.

Literature 
The case was assessed as BCC level 2 per the 
Brighton Collaboration algorithm based on the 
clinical features of encephalopathy, changed 
mentation, upper motor neuron signs 
(increased reflexes, bilateral Babinski,) acute 
onset and multi-focal features on MRI 
suggesting demyelination in the cerebrum. 
Potential infectious and auto-immune causes 
were potentially ruled out, however there was 
an unevaluated acute episode of self-resolving 
myalgia just prior to COVID-19 vaccination. 
Additionally, there was a description of 
anterior horn spinal cord 
ischemia/hypoperfusion or possible infarction 
on MRI suggesting a vascular/vasculitic 
pathology and noted paradoxical breathing 
was consistent with spinal cord pathology 
causing diaphragm paralysis. Limited or no 
information on any biopsy or autopsy, exact 
causes of death, work up for possible 
malignancies, paraneoplastic syndromes, and 
hematological investigations were not 
available. Hypertensive encephalopathy or 
acute fulminant multiple sclerosis would also 
be in the differential. Based on reasonable 
time relationship of the neurological event, 
onset to vaccine administration, the WHO-
UMC was assessed as Possible with 
confounders of hypertension and spinal cord 
ischemia.

Of the 80 cases, 5 had a fatal outcome. The case fatality rate of 6.3% is in line with 
previously document case fatality rates in ADEM (5% to 50%; Borlot et al 201 1). Two (2) 
cases were from literature sources and 3 cases from spontaneous sources. The TTO was 
reported in 4 of 5 cases (same day, 1 2  days, 14 days, and 49 days) and all cases were reported 
or considered to be following 1 st vaccine dose. The time to fatal outcome was reported in 2 
of 5 cases (7 days and 20 days). Sufficient information to classify the reported ADEM event 
as BCC level  1 to 3 was available only in 3 of 5 cases (BCC level 2 in 2 cases and BCC level 
1 in 1  case). Reasonable information to rule in a possible confounding role of other diseases 
for fatal outcome was identified in 1 case in which the patient's underlying significant cardiac 
(heart disease with ischemic cardiac events) and metabolic (ketoacidosis) issues. The 
remaining 4 of 5 cases had insufficient information on medical history, autopsy, any 
corrective therapy, medical history, or comprehensive etiological work-up ( eg, work up for 
possible malignancies or paraneoplastic syndromes). 
In summary no significant safety concerns were seen on review of ADEM cases with fatal 
outcome. 
Observed Versus Expected Analysis 
An observed versus expected (O/E) analysis of 'Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis' was 
conducted cumulatively to 28 June 2022. The results were stratified by 3 risk windows 
(14, 30 and 42 days) for all global reports, stratified by age in the European Union (EU), UK, 
Brazil, and Australia, and by age and gender. The risk window of 2 to 42 days was included 
from the Brighton case definition (Law B 2021  [B]). In order to provide an accurate 
incidence rate for this rare event, a meta-analysis using random-effect model was performed 
based on data from years 201 7  to 201 9  from databases (ES_BIFAP _PC, 
ES_BIFAP _PCHOSP, ES_FISABIO, ES_SIDIAP _PC (Spain Information System for the 
Development of Research in Primary Care), ES_SIDIAP _PCHOSP, and IT_ARS, 
UK_CPRD) presented in the revised ACCESS protocol (Willame et al 2021 ). Please refer to 
Appendix 8 for the methodology of the O/E analyses. 
The O/E analysis for the cumulative cases of 'Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis' with 
risk windows of 14, 30, and 42 days is presented with results in Table 140. 
Conservatively, the exposure for global reports (4483061 52) is based on doses administered

The 0/E analysis of all cases of ADEM suggested that the observed cases of ADEM cases 
were less than the number of expected cases in the 30-day risk and the 42-day risk windows, 
while for the 14-day risk window the analysis suggested that the observed cases of ADEM 
were significantly more than the number of expected cases. As a conservative approach all 
cases with time to onset within 0 to 42 days and all cases with unknown time to onset were 
included in the 0/E analysis. The vaccine exposure by doses administered for 0/E analysis 
were only considered from few countries where the data were available. Fifteen cases were 
reported with the ADEM onset within O to 5 days of V AXZEVRIA vaccination. A latency of 
ADEM within 0 to 5 days of immunization is considered too short and cases less than 5 days 
from vaccination would be questionable in any causative association and may be possibly 
indicative of pre-existing infection or underlying condition. While immunization with the 
Semple rabies vaccine, which has a proven association with ADEM (Sejvar et al 2007; 
Hemachudha et al 1 987 [A], has been shown to be associated with a peak interval of 1 to 2 
weeks between immunization and onset of ADEM's neurologic symptoms among some 
vaccine recipients (Hemachudha et al 1 987 [B]). Leake et al 2004, in an epidemiologic study 
of64 ADEM cases also reported 93% of ADEM patients had one or more of the following 
symptoms or signs of infection within the preceding 2 1  days: fever, cough, rhinorrhea; 
vomiting; or diarrhoea. Of the 37 cases within  14 days TTO, there were 1 5  reports of ADEM

reported within the risk window of 0-5 days; if the 1 5  reports are excluded the observed cases 
are less than expected Also, there is a possibility of reporting bias for increased reporting of 
cases with a shorter risk window for the passive event reporting of rare diseases. When cases 
with unknown TTO were added to the observed numbers, observed cases were significantly 
more than expected for the 14-day and 30-day risk windows. However, an O/E analysis of 
cases meeting BCC levels 1 to 3 showed that the observed number ADEM cases fulfilling 
case definition were less and/or significantly less than number of expected cases in all risk 
windows except the 14-day risk window including cases with unknown TTO. 
When O/E analyses are stratified by age in EU, UK, Australia, and Brazil, and different risk 
windows (14, 30, and 42 days), numbers of cases become very small resulting in observed as 
greater than expected for most age groups. The O/E analysis for cases meeting the BCC level 
1 ,  2 or 3 and stratified by age group with different risk windows (14, 30, and 42 days) 
suggested that observed cases were less than expected for most age groups. Also, there is too 
much variability in these data to make an assessment. 
When O/E analysis are stratified by age and gender in the UK for cases meeting BCC level 1 ,  
2 ,  or, 3 the observed numbers were significantly greater or greater than expected in females 
aged 1 8  to 49 and males aged 50 to 59 in all risk windows. The observed numbers were less 
than expected in other age and sex stratifications. 
Further review of cases in these groups where observed were above expected showed that 
most cases had insufficient information to make any causality assessment. Of the 80 cases 
reported during the reporting period, only 34 cases met BCC level 1 to 3. 
The O/E analyses provided is based on the most recent and available data, but there is a level 
of assumption made and any change in the data would impact the results. The following are 
some of the limitations/assumptions of the data used: 
•  Doses administered for determination of exposure: Currently only exposure data from 
certain countries are available, but these countries generate the majority of cases reported 
to AstraZeneca. 
•  The background incidence rate used for the calculation is the same as the population 
vaccinated: The identification of incidence rates can vary depending on the source of the 
data. 
•  Most of the observed events are spontaneously reported: Spontaneously reported events 
may only represent a fraction of the events that have actually occurred. Both under­
reporting for certain events, and conversely, over-reporting for certain events could have 
played a role. 
•  The risk period reflects the period of time an event would occur post-vaccination: 
Over-estimating the risk window would increase the "Person-Years at Risk" period and 
include events that are outside the actual period of time a true event would occur. 
Under-estimating the risk window will result in reduced sensitivity making it difficult to 
reach statistical significance.

The O/E analyses does not account for confounding/risk factors which might be present in the 
cases, such as seasonal effects on the occurrence of certain events, or for example the effect 
ofCOVID which may also contribute. Also, when stratified by age/gender, there are small 
numbers of cases in each stratification, which should be considered when interpreting the 
significance of the results. 
Literature Review 
A cumulative literature search to 28 June 2022 of the databases in Embase, InsightMeme, and 
PubMed was conducted using the following search terms for ADEM with V AXZEVRIA: 
'acute disseminated encephalomyelitis'/exp OR 'acute disseminated encephalomyelitis' OR 
'ADEM'. 
The literature search resulted in 126 articles. After medical review of all the articles, 1 5  
articles (which includes 2 3  cases) were considered relevant and are discussed in the section 
below and in the Section 2.6 AstraZeneca Global Patient Safety Database. These relevant 
articles are as fo

; Rinaldi et al 2022 
; Simone et al 2021 
; Permezel 
; and an article reference that was redacted in the source document 
; Tapdia et al 2022 
). The remaining 1 1 1  articles were considered to be not relevant as these did 
not describe ADEM or did not identify any safety concerns with ADEM following 
V AXZEVRIA vaccination. 
Netravathi et al 2022 described an observational comparative analysis study, case series ( over 
a period from May 202 1 to December 202 1) of patients with different neurological 
manifestations of CNS demyelination presenting within 6 weeks of vaccination against 
SARS-Co V-2 versus controls, from a neuropsychiatric tertiary university hospital in India. 
A total of 1 16 patients with CNS demyelination were assessed during the study period, of 
whom 29 met the inclusion criteria for post-vaccine demyelination and the rest were taken as 
controls as either they were already diagnosed with 1  of the disorders with CNS 
demyelination or were not vaccinated within 6 weeks of the demyelination. 
The inclusion criteria for post-vaccine demyelination comprised a) receipt of a SARS-Co V-2 
vaccine, either 1st or 2nd dose within the past 42 days; b) no recent history ofCOVID-1 9  
infection within the past 3 months; and c) evidence o f  CNS demyelination based on clinical 
and radiological features. The exclusion criterion was presence of other precipitating factors 
besides SARS-CoV-2 vaccine as a cause for demyelination in the last 3 months.

In addition to patient history, clinical examination, and routine hematological investigations, 
the following investigations were performed: CSF analysis, serum and/or CSF NMO 
antibodies, MOO antibodies (testing done with IgOl ), MRI of the brain and/or spine, evoked 
potentials (visual evoked potentials, brainstem auditory evoked response, somatosensory 
evoked potential) and ancillary investigations to exclude alternative etiologies: serum 
antinuclear antibodies (ANA) profile, C-reactive protein, and antineutrophil cytoplasmic 
antibodies. 
Out of the 29 cases, 27 received ChAdOxl -S vaccine, while 2 were vaccinated with 
BBV1 52. Most patients (n=22; 75.9%) developed the symptoms after the 1 st vaccination 
dose and none of them had prior history of demyelination. The timing of presentation for 
neurological symptoms after vaccine exposure ranged from 1 to 42 days. 
The CSF cell count ( excluding singular case of traumatic CSF picture) was reported in 25 of 
29 (86%) cases with pleocytosis seen in 1 5  (60%) cases and normal counts seen in 10 (40%) 
cases. For controls, the CSF cell count was reported in 61 of 87 (70%) controls with 
pleocytosis seen in 1 9  (22%) controls; however, there was insufficient information on 
proportion of normal CSF counts. The CSF protein was raised in 12 of25 (48%) cases and 
normal counts seen in 1 3  (52%) cases. For controls, the CSF protein was raised in 1 1  of 59 
(18.6%) controls; however, there was insufficient information on proportion of normal CSF 
protein. 
Information on CSF oligoclonal bands was available in 10 of29 (34%) cases and 47 of 
87 (54%) controls and no significant difference was seen in its frequency (60% in cases and 
68% in controls; p=0.6293). Information on ANA positivity was available in all 29 of cases 
and 74 of 87 (85%) controls and no significant difference was seen in its frequency (20.7% in 
cases and 16.2% in controls; p=0.5903). 
Information on myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOO) positivity and aquaporin-4 
(AQP4) positivity was available in all 29 cases and 69 of 87 (79.3%) controls. Ten of29 
(34.5%) cases and 10 of 69 (14.5%) controls were found to be positive for MOO antibodies 
(p=0.0257). Out of 1 0  cases, 4 presented with optic neuritis (ON), 3 with ADEM, 2 with 
longitudinally extensive myelitis, and 1 with simultaneous ON and myelitis. Two (2) patients 
were diagnosed with AQP4-positive NMOSD in this post-vaccine period while 1 patient was 
diagnosed with McDonald's definite multiple sclerosis. The rest of the patients were 
seronegative for both AQP4 and MOO antibodies. The ANA profile showed antibody 
positivity in 4 patients. A paraneoplastic profile was performed in 1 patient, and it was 
positive for anti-recoverin antibody with no evidence of malignancy on computed 
tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen. The majority of patients in the control group had 
the diagnosis of multiple sclerosis (48 of 87  [55.2%]) followed by AQP4-positive NMOSD 
(1 1 of 87 [ 12.6%]). 
Significant improvement was seen in most (96.5%) patients with medical management 
(intravenous methylprednisolone followed by oral steroids, plasmapheresis, intravenous lg, 
mycophenolate mofetil, and rituximab). One (1) patient with ADEM with tumefactive

demyelinating lesions remained critically ill, requiring invasive ventilation, and died after a 
prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay and superimposed infection. Two (2) patients 
received a 2nd ChAdOx 1-S vaccine dose while talcing 20 mg of oral prednisone and did not 
show neurological worsening. One (1) patient received an alternative BBV152 vaccination 
after a primary ChAdOxl -S vaccine dose without any adverse events. 
All the cases were suggested by the authors to have a probable causality label. This was in 
view of temporal association of symptoms occurring within 6 weeks of administration of 
COVID-1 9  vaccination without an alternative reason. 
The authors concluded that it was difficult to establish a causal relationship between 
vaccination and neurological adverse events such as demyelination. The temporal association 
with the vaccination and the presence of MOG antibodies raises the possibility of an 
immunogenic process triggered by the vaccine in susceptible individuals. 
AstraZeneca Comment 
This study was based on chart review from a tertiary care centre in India. There was no 
information on the expected frequency of CNS demyelination in the tertiary hospital in India 
to assess the trend of observed frequency of the 1 16 CNS demyelination cases. 
The controls comprising of patients already diagnosed with 1  of the disorders with CNS 
demyelination or those who were not vaccinated within 6 weeks of the demyelination is not 
considered a suitable comparison group for case-control analysis. It was not reported whether 
the patients with pre-existing demyelination were on any concurrent immunosuppressive 
therapy, which might have confounded the current presentation, especially the immunological 
parameters. 
Out of a total of 1 16 patients with CNS demyelination, 61 patients received ChAdOx 1 
NCoV-1 9  vaccination (27 in the cases and 34 in the controls). Thus, in the majority of the 
ChAdOx 1 N Co V-1 9  vaccinated patients presenting with CNS demyelination, either a 
pre-existing underlying demyelination was identified or TTO of the adverse event following 
vaccination was considered unreasonable. Also, since this study was based on chart review 
rather than actual patient monitoring, the authors could not flawlessly estimate the occurrence 
of COVID-1 9  infection in the study population ( as highlighted as a limitation of this study). 
These limitations preclude a comprehensive causal assessment beyond a temporal 
association. 
Additionally, CSF investigation parameters were not consistently reported for all patients in 
cases and controls and, therefore, any consistent association could not be comprehensively 
assessed. No significant difference was seen in the patterns of CSF oligoclonal bands 
between cases and controls to signify any particular pathogenesis. 
Similarly, MOG antibody parameters were not consistently reported for all patients in the 
control group (reported in 79.3% of controls versus  100% in cases) and hence a comparison 
regarding it in the cases and controls could not be comprehensively made.

In the article, there was insufficient information on background characteristics and matching 
of the complete cohort. Hence, the cohort of the 'susceptible' individuals as reported by the 
authors could not be further assessed. 
On review of the 80 cases of ADEM in the AstraZeneca global safety database, 1 8  (22.5%) 
cases had information on anti-MOG antibody status. Of the 1 8  cases, 8 (44.4%) cases were 
anti-MOG positive, 9 (50%) cases were anti-MOG negative and in 1  case (5.5%) the 
anti-MOG status was unknown. 
On review of the global safety database, no specific trend with respect to MOG antibody 
positive status ADEM in individuals vaccinated with V AXZEVRIA was seen. 
Mechanism of Action 
On review of the proposed mechanisms for COVID-1 9  vaccines, the mechanisms were 
discussed mainly for demyelinating events, as a whole, rather than to ADEM in particular. 
The various mechanisms hypothesized by the authors were: 
•  Molecular mimicry of viral proteins to myelin (Ismail and Salama 2022; Matsumoto et al 
2022; Lee et al 2022) 
• 
Immunological triggering or unmasking of pre-existing pathology by vaccine adjuvants, 
adenovirus vector, and messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) (acting as both antigen and 
adjuvant) (Ismail and Salama 2022; Lee et al 2022) 
•  Bystander activation eg, autoreactive lymphocytes (Fujinami et al 2006; Matsumoto et al 
2022 ; Lee et al 2022) 
• 
Susceptible patients (Ismail and Salama 2022; Lee et al 2022) 
These mechanisms are described in detail below 
The proposed mechanism of molecular mimicry was mainly predicted based on 
cross-reactions between human host and SARS-CoV-2 proteins (Yapici-Eser et al 202 1 ;  
Vojdani and Kharrazian 2020). Using a computational model, Yapici-Eser et al 2021 
predicted the possible interaction of SARS-CoV-2 proteins (approximately 1 1  proteins) with 
proteins involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking, endocytosis, axonal transport, neuronal 
transmission, thrombosis, inflammation, and the mitochondrial and blood brain barrier as 
well as protein growth factors. However, the authors acknowledged the limitations of in silico 
models and suggested further exploration using in vitro and in vivo models. In an 
experimental in vitro study reported as a letter to the editor, Vojdani and Kharrazian 2020 
tested commercially available mouse monoclonal antibody against recombinant SARS 
coronavirus spike protein (anti SARS-CoV-2 spike antibody) and rabbit monoclonal antibody 
made against SARS coronavirus nucleoprotein to 50 different human tissue antigens 
( autoimmune epitopes) using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The authors reported 
strong reactions against transglutaminase 3, transglutaminase 2, anti-extractable nuclear 
antigen, myelin basic protein, mitochondria, nuclear antigen, a-myosin, and thyroid 
peroxidase among others. However, as this study was reported as a letter to the editor with 
insufficient information on methodology, inter-species antigenic variability, in vitro design,

any correlation with observed frequency of autoimmunity with COVID-19, and any 
correlation with rare autoimmune reactions following vaccination to allow any further 
extrapolation of the study findings to clinical settings is not possible. In summary, there is 
lack of conclusive clinical evidence for molecular mimicry, especially for ADEM. 
The proposed mechanism of triggering pre-existing immune pathology by vaccines was 
hypothesized to the adjuvants or viral vector (eg, adenovirus vector), or the mRNA itself 
(Ismail and Salama 2022). However, there was insufficient information linking proof of 
mechanism in either a mechanism-based study or further exploration of mechanism in the 
same case. 
The proposed mechanism of bystander activation is ascribed mainly to activation of antigen 
presenting cells to local dying cells in areas of tissue destruction and inflammation and 
thereby stimulation, activation and proliferation of autoreactive T- or B-cells eg, myelin 
oligodendrocyte antibody (Fujinami et al 2006; Matsumoto et al 2022; Ismail and Salama 
2022). This mechanism is considered to be non-specific to any immune stimulant type. 
The authors also hypothesize a possible role of immunological and genetic susceptibility in 
combination to vaccine-related factors as described above for the demyelination events 
(Ismail and Salama 2022; Lee et al 2022). However, there is insufficient information on any 
identification of immunological and genetic susceptibility to date. 
AstraZeneca comment for mechanisms of action 
The review of mechanisms proposed by the authors suggests both vaccine-specific and 
patient susceptibility factors. However, no conclusive evidence linking proof of mechanism 
in either a mechanism-based study or further exploration of mechanism in the same case was 
identified. No new safety signals were identified from review of literature. 
Other sources 
The EVDAS was used to look for any signals of disproportionate reporting (SDR). The 
reporting odds ratio (RoR) was evaluated on the available data up to and including 15 June 
2022 (run on 2 1  June 2022) and a SDR (EVDAS ROR 1 .06) was identified for V AXZEVRIA 
(ChAdOxl NCoV 1 9) and 'Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis'. ADEM is a rare and 
serious event and when this event is compared against the drugs in EVDAS, especially in the 
context of global rollout of COVID-1 9  vaccines, it is expected to show a disproportionality. 
Additionally, the RoR scoring is susceptible to a number of scoring biases. Some common 
biases encountered with ROR scoring includes dictionary structure, notoriety bias, reporting 
bias and masking or cloaking. Some of these biases can be corrected by data stratification 
techniques but are not employed through RoR scoring. The differing regional scoring 
attempts to lessen some of these effects 
On review of other COVID-1 9  vaccine labels (Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) 
and PI), none of the labels had information on PT 'Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis'.

Summary and Discussion 
AstraZeneca 
25 August 2022 
ADEM is an acute autoimmune multifocal demyelinating disease. Viral illnesses and 
vaccinations have been reported in association to ADEM It may have a life-threatening 
severity. Although no specific criteria exist for diagnosing ADEM, it has a broad differential 
and thereby the antecedent history, temporal course of the illness, neuroimaging, CSF 
analysis, and probably repeat imaging during remission are most important in arriving at the 
diagnosis and excluding other causes of encephalopathy. 
On review of AstraZeneca's Global Safety Database cumulatively to 28 June 2022, a total of 
80 cases of ADEM with the use of V AXZEVRIA have been received. All of the reported 
cases were serious. Fifty-seven (57) of the 80 cases were reported from spontaneous sources. 
The majority of the cases were reported after the 1 st dose. None of the cases that occurred 
after the 1 st dose were identified to have positive rechallenge or worsened after the 2nd/3rd 
dose. The age range was 22 to 90 years with a median of 53 years. This was well within the 
age range (19 to 61 years) mentioned by Schwarz et al 200 1 .  Gender was reported in 79 
cases, of which 43 (54%) cases were reported in female vaccinees suggesting a slight female 
preponderance. 
Overall, 56 (70%) of the 80 cases were medically confirmed. In 46 (57.5%) cases, ADEM 
was reported to cause hospitalization and in 45 (56.3%) cases ADEM was considered a 
medically important event. In 27 (33.8%) cases the events had a favorable outcome ie, 
recovering/resolving/resolved. Five (5; 6.3%) cases had a fatal outcome. In the 5 fatal cases, 
the WHO-UMC causality was considered as "Possible" with limited information in 1 case, 
"Possible" with confounders in 1 case, "Unlikely" in 2 cases, and "Unassessable" in 1 case. 
Two (2) cases met BCC level 2 and 1 case met BCC level 1 .  No significant safety concerns 
were seen on review of ADEM cases with fatal outcome. In 25 (3 1 .3%) cases the outcome 
was not recovered. The case fatality rate of 6.3% is in line with previously document case 
fatality rates in ADEM (5% to 50%; Borlot et al 201 1). 
Out of the 80 cases, 3 (3.8%) fulfilled BCC level 1, 26 (32.5%) fulfilled BCC level 2, 5 
(6.3%) fulfilled BCC level 3, which fulfilled the diagnostic criteria for certainty. Of the 3 
cases fulfilling BCC level 1 ,  2 cases were assessed as "Possible" with limited information 
and 1 case was assessed as "Unlikely" per the WHO-UMC causality assessment criteria. 
Of the 80 cases, TTO was reported in 50 (62.5%) cases and the median TTO was 8 days. The 
0/E analysis of all ADEM cases suggested that there was insufficient information to make 
any causality assessment from the groups where observed cases were above expected. On 
review of the 56 (70%) medically confirmed cases, 25 (44.6%) cases met BCC level 1 to 3 
and the WHO-UMC causality was assessed as "Possible" with confounders in 12 (48%) 
cases, "Possible" with limited information in 6 (24%) cases and "Unlikely" in 4 (16%) cases. 
The remaining 3 cases (12%) had insufficient case details for a comprehensive causal 
assessment. Amongst 56 medically confirmed cases for ADEM, 24 (42.9%) were identified 
either with relevant risk/confounding factors.

There were no events of Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis' from the pre-clinical and 
clinical studies. The 0/E analysis of all ADEM cases suggested that overall, the observed 
numbers were significantly less than the expected numbers in the 42-day risk windows. The 
observed numbers were greater than expected in a few sub group stratifications and may be 
explained by reporting bias for increased reporting of cases with a shorter risk window for the 
passive event reporting of rare diseases. Review of cases in these subgroups where observed 
numbers were above expected showed that most cases had insufficient information to make 
any causality assessment. On review of the PT 'Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis' in 
Eudra Vigilance database (EVDAS), it exceeded the disproportionality assessment threshold. 
ADEM is a rare and serious event and when this event is compared against the drugs in 
EVDAS, especially in the context of global rollout of COVID-1 9  vaccines, it is expected to 
show a disproportionality. Therefore, this finding is not considered significant. A trend 
analysis was conducted of case reports over time. The analysis identified a peak in reporting 
in March/April and November/December 2021 ,  which may be due to the prevalence of 
COVID-1 9  infection in the community as it coincided with COVID-1 9  pandemic peaks 
rather than with vaccine exposure. AstraZeneca does not consider the trend analysis to be 
suggestive of increased risk due to V AXZEVRIA. 
On cumulative review of the literature to 28 June 2022, there is insufficient evidence to 
establish a causality or any conclusive mechanism of action, and in addition, did not identify 
any new safety information for ADEM and V AXZEVRIA The review of mechanism of 
action articles and case reports found no conclusive evidence linking proof of mechanism in 
either a mechanism-based study or further exploration of mechanism in the same case were 
identified. No new safety signals were identified from review of literature. 
AstraZeneca's review of the cases in the safety database, 0/E analysis, clinical and pre­
clinical databases, external databases, and competitor labels does not bring any new 
information that will alter the current benefit-risk profile for the event 'Acute disseminated 
encephalomyelitis' in association with V AXZEVRIA. As is already stated in Section 4.4 of 
the CDS that neurological events, which includes demyelinating disorders, are very rare 
events reported following vaccination with V AXZEVRIA. A causal relationship has not been 
established. As with other vaccines, the benefits and potential risks of vaccinating individuals 
with V AXZEVRIA should be considered. AstraZeneca's review of the cases in the safety

AstraZeneca's review of the cases in the safety database, O/E analysis, clinical and pre­
clinical databases, literature and external databases does not bring any new information that 
will alter the current benefit-risk profile for the event 'Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis' 
in association with V AXZEVRIA. As is already stated in Section 4.4 of the CDS that 
neurological events, which includes demyelinating disorders such as Guillain-Barre 
Syndrome (OBS), are very rare events reported following vaccination with V AXZEVRIA. A 
causal relationship has not been established. As with other vaccines, the benefits and 
potential risks of vaccinating individuals with V AXZEVRIA should be considered. 
Therefore, AstraZeneca considers that no updates to CDS or RMP are required. 
ADEM will continue to be closely monitored as part of AstraZeneca's ongoing surveillance 
efforts for the important potential risk of nervous system disorders, including 
immune-mediated neurological conditions. 
15.2.13  Viral reactivation (Non-Zoster) 
In the assessment report received from the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee 
(PRAC) EMA (EMEA/H/C/PSUSN00010912/2021 12) for the V AXZEVRIA PBRER 
(review period 29 June 202 1 - 28 Dec 2021), further information on the topic of Viral 
reactivation (non-Zoster) is requested as follows: 
The MAH is asked to provide: 
• An overview cumulative review of viral reactivation (in the HLGT "Viral infectious 
disorders '') from all available sources in the next PSUR,  including details of the underlying 
condition(s), concomitant treatments, time to onset, duration, outcome and an assessment of 
the causal relationship with the vaccine 
• A discussion on the need for any potential amendment to the product information, as 
appropriate or other risk minimisation measures 
Also 4 confirmed serious cases of Viral reactivation (Non-Zoster) highlighted by PRAC were 
referenced in the assessment report. These cases have been summarised in Table  149. 
Global Patient Safety Database 
A cumulative search till DLP 28 Jun 2022 of the AstraZeneca Global Safety Database for 
Viral Infectious Disorders with V AXZEVRIA was performed using MedDRA version 25.0 in 
the AE High Level Group Term "Viral Infectious Disorders". The search retrieved a total of 
53,252 events of viral infections occurring post vaccine and included 1 52 PTs. The PTs were 
reviewed to only include cases with viruses (viral infections) that have the potential to cause 
both latent and lytic cycles of replication, and to exclude zoster viruses (herpes zoster 
infections). 
Based on this strategy 98 PTs were excluded and the following 54 PTs were included as part 
of the search which yielded 935 cases: Herpes virus infection; Herpes simplex; Genital 
herpes; Infectious mononucleosis; Herpes ophthalmic; Nasal herpes; Skin papilloma; 
Meningitis viral; Herpes simplex reactivation; Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection; Mumps;

information (eg, clinical course of the event). 
One additional case from literature by Tang et al 2021 (case ID

cases are 56. 
Clinical Study Data 
A search was conducted in the AstraZeneca Clinical database for serious adverse events 
(SAEs) of viral reactivation excluding zoster viruses in association with the use of 
V AXZEVRIA (formerly AZD1222) reported from all completed and ongoing clinical studies 
with data cut-off 29 June 2022 for ongoing studies. The search utilized the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA; version 25.0) with the above-mentioned PTs. 
An additional search was conducted in the AstraZeneca Clinical database for participants 
with a medical history of viral reactivation with the same search strategy. 
Although a total of 750 subjects had a medical history of viral diseases in the clinical trials 
with the use of V AXZEVRIA (formerly AZD1222), the search yielded 5 cases of SAEs in 
which patients experienced viral infection; however, none of them were assessed as viral 
reactivation. 
Non-clinical data 
Data from the V AXZEVRIA pre-clinical safety database was searched and no information of 
the viral reactivation was found.

Fatal 
Of the 56 cases reporting Viral reactivation (Non-Zoster), there was one case of death 
however the outcome of the event under review (PT: Chronic hepatitis B) was reported as 
unknown. This case which was medically confirmed is summarized below. 
: A spontaneous serious and medically confirmed case from Estonia 
Case 
(EMA) where a 3 1 -old male patient with a medical history of chronic hepatitis B (HBV), type 
2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension and migraine died from the event of disseminated 
intravascular coagulation, ischaemic stroke ( confirmed at autopsy), ten days after vaccination 
with V AXZEVRIA. A CT scan preformed on 27 February 2021  showed: thrombosis of 
arteria carotis intema (ACI) and arteria cerebri media (ACM). The patient has been tested 
negative for COVID 1 9  virus. On 01 March 202 1 ,  the platelet count was Thrombocytopaenia 
up to 5 E9/L. Other diagnostic tests performed were P-HBV DNA QN 492 IU/ml, HBsAg 
positive, HBsAb QN negative, HBsAb 2 IU/L, HBc IgM negative, HBcAb positive, HBeAg 
negative, HBeAB positive. The reporter assessed the events disseminated intravascular 
coagulation, ischaemic stroke, severe thrombocytopenia, severe headache, chronic hepatitis b, 
brain edema, fever, pyrexia, as serious medical condition that required hospitalization and 
ischemic stroke to be serious due to seriousness criteria of death. The outcome was fatal for 
the events of ischemic stroke and disseminated intravascular coagulation. 
AstraZeneca comment: In this case although the P-HBV DNA QN level of 492 IU/ml was 
indicted, a viral reactivation could not be comprehensively confirmed as there was 
insufficient information on previous HBV DNA status (patient had chronic Hepatitis B). The 
case was assessed as Possible (with limited information) according to WHO-UMC criteria. 
Rechallenge / Recurrence case reports 
Cumulatively through 28 June 2022, 1 ( 1 .8%) of 56 case reports was reported as 
rechallenge/recurrence case. 
Pedrazini et al 2022 Case 
This case is a 60-year-old patient who experienced 
Herpes simplex type I reactivation after the first dose, and a positive recurrence or worsening 
of Herpes simplex type I reactivation with the second dose of vaccination indicating potential 
positive recurrence / rechallenge. The case was medically confirmed, non-serious report from 
a literature. The case was identified within the risk window of 2 1  days. The patient's medical 
history included latent HHV-1 .  The author stated the patient presented with herpetic labial 
lesion after 7 days of the first and second dose, in the same location as previous episodes 
2 year before the vaccine. The outcome was reported as recovering (patient has had a 
remission). 
AstraZeneca comment: There was no further information on investigations to confirm lytic 
phase of the virus (eg: DNA copies). The patient's immune status, relevant medical history or 
concomitant medications, surgical procedures, or any exposure to close contacts are unknown

*Cases were considered to have  "risk factors/corifounders " where the event could also be explained by the 
vaccinee 's diseases,  or where relevant risk factors were present, or concomitant medications that could 
potentially contribute to the development of the event were reported. 
For  1 3  cases assessed as Possible (with risk factors/confounders) the following relevant risk / 
confounding factors were identified: autoimmune hypothyroidism, lupus erythematosus 
disseminated, pyelonephritis, chronic cystitis, capsulitis of shoulder, orthotopic heart 
transplantation, tooth abscess, end-stage renal disease, haemodialysis, immunosuppressants, 
type 2 diabetes, viral encephalitis, viral meningitis, radiotherapy, breast cancer, eczema,

(TTO of 14 days). The patient had no allergies, no history of immune deficiency, or recent 
infectious disease. Patient denied the use of illicit drug. Two weeks after vaccination, the 
patient suffered from fever, weakness and arthralgia of the knees, hips and shoulders. 
Because both, antibiotic treatment with piperacillin/tazobactam and steroids did not improve 
clinical symptoms with persistent fever and weakness, the patient was hospitalized with 
stable vital parameters and normal physical examination. CT scans of the chest and abdomen 
revealed reactive mediastinal lymphadenopathy and hepatic steatosis. A repeat 
nasopharyngeal swab for Sars-Cov-2 RNA testing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was 
negative. Serological examination excluded HBV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis E virus 
(HEV) infection, and HIV. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed diagnosis 
of pericarditis with circumferential thickening and contrast enhancement of the entire 
pericardium at late gadolinium enhancement. Based on these imaging findings, heart 
involvement with viral pericarditis was suspected. EBV serology was compatible with past 
infection (anti-EBV-VCA-IgG: positive, anti-EBV-IgM: negative), confirmed by PCR with 
no detectable EBV-DNA. However, serology ofCMV was compatible with active CMV 
infection (anti-CMV-IgG: greater than 250 IU/mL, anti-CMVIgM: positive), confirmed by 
PCR with detectable CMV viremia (41 5  IU/mL). The patient recovered from the events of 
reactivation of cytomegalovirus infection and pericarditits. Authors Comment: The clinical 
course of a patient with CMV reactivation and pericarditis in temporal association with 
ChAdOxl nCoV-1 9  vaccination against SARSCoV-2. 
AstraZeneca comment: Patient had viral serology findings suggesting past infection of EBV 
and CMV. Both these viruses are known to have latent and lytic phases. However, 
reactivation of only one virus was seen (CMV). This can also be explained by viral derived 
factors (such as its known natural history). In addition, it's known that this elderly patient has 
a history of obesity and degenerative knee joint disease, however, at the time of the event 
there is a limited information about her concomitant medications. It is also unknown how 
long the patient took antibacterial and steroid therapy, which can lead to suppression of 
immunity before her admission to the hospital and serological testing. Based on WHO-UMC 
classification, the causality assessment is Probable. Association between the event and 
V AXZEVRIA cannot be ruled out. 
Overall, the review of medically confirmed cases did not raise any new relevant safety 
information for V AXZEVRIA. 
Literature 
AstraZeneca conducted a cumulative search of the literature to identify any articles in 
Embase, InsightMeme, and PubMed published from 29 December 2020 to 28 June 2022

trials), study population, size and design, limitations, overall impact, and conflict of interest. 
Seven literature case reports and case series describing the use of V AXZEVRIA identified 
through this literature review were also registered within the Global Safety Database. One of 
these 7 cases assessed as Probable-likely according to WHO-UMC assessment was discussed 
above in respective subsection. One of the remaining 6 has been discussed under Rechallenge 
I Recurrence case reports section. The remaining 5 cases are discussed below. 
Ardalan M et al 2022 ( case ID 
In this case report authors describe a 28- year-
old man, with no systemic disease, presented with herpes-like skin lesions on his right upper 
eyelid 2 days following the first dose of ChAdOxl  nCo V-1 9  vaccine. The patient reported a 
post-trauma history of a herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection of the right eye in his 
childhood. According to the patient, he has experienced periods of cold sore (herpes simplex 
labialis) ever since. Treatment was started based on the diagnosis ofrecurrent HSV lesion of 
the upper eyelid. Seven days after the onset of the lesion, signs and symptoms disappeared. 
AstraZeneca comment: There is limited information on patient concomitant medications, 
medical history, and presence of any alternate viral reactivation triggers that precluded a

a full recovery and were subsequently discharged home. 
AstraZeneca comment: There is limited information on event details, patient concomitant 
medications, medical history, and presence of any alternate viral reactivation triggers that 
precluded a proper assessment. The case was assessed as Possible (with limited information) 
according to WHO-UMC criteria. 
In this case report article 
Moslemi, Mohammadreza, et al 2022 ( case ID 
authors present a case of herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) in a 27-year-old male patient 
with no underlying systemic conditions and no prior history of herpes simplex virus (HSV) 
and COVID-1 9  infection who received his first dose of ChAdOxl nCo V-1 9  COVID-1 9  
vaccine (AZD1222) 8 days prior to being referred to the clinic. Neurological examination 
revealed altered mental status and decreased level of consciousness, and disorientation. 
Following examination revealed elevated temperature of 38.9 °C (102.02 °F) and 
leukocytosis (12,900/mm3). Laboratory tests were all in normal ranges. However, antiviral 
therapy was started based on patient clinical symptoms and his medical history. Decreased 
protein levels (3.05 mg/dl) in CSF analysis with the predominance of lymphocyte, and 
normal glucose levels were suggestive of a viral encephalitis. The final diagnosis was made 
after polymerase chain reaction (PCR) showed a positive result for HSV in the CSF. The 
patient was discharged with clinical improvement on the 2 1 st day. However, authors 
concluded that regarding the correlation of the ChAdOx 1 nov-1 9  vaccine and herpes simplex 
encephalitis is unattainable due to scarcity of similar evidence. Author's proposed potential 
Mechanism of action when the vaccine can initiate cytokine release and an immune response 
cascade in a similar fashion to viral infections of SARS-Co V-2 itself and further upregulation 
of NKG2D ligands and reactivation of the HSV from its latent phase and development of the 
clinical signs and symptoms of herpetic infections. 
AstraZeneca comment: There is a limited information on patient concomitant medications, 
patient comorbidities, inflammatory and/or infectious disease, sinus surgery, ophthalmic or 
dental invasive procedures before vaccination which could be one of the triggers of 
developing HSE. A possible mechanism was also described within this article. However, this 
hypothesis has not been verified. To date, no conclusive mechanism of action leading to viral 
reactivation after COVID-1 9  vaccination has been identified. Furthermore, the mechanism as 
applicable to AZD1222 remains unclear. The case was assessed as Possible (with limited 
information) according to WHO-UMC criteria. 
) In this case report article authors present a case of 
Singh et al 2022 ( case ID 
herpes simplex (HSV) retinitis in 29-year-old male two days following the first dose of the 
Covishield vaccine. Since the blood serologies were all negative, a diagnostic vitrectomy was 
performed and the vitreous sample for viral PCR came positive for HSV-1 .  At 6-week 
follow-up, the patient improved with a near-complete resolution ofretinitis after the course of 
antiviral therapy.

Tang et al 202 1 ( case ID 
In this article authors report a case of a heart 
transplant recipient who presented with a rapidly growing Epstein-Barr virus- positive, 
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in a 5 1 -year-old man 7 days after receiving the first dose of 
the ChAdOxl nCoV-1 9  vaccine. He had been diagnosed with idiopathic dilated 
cardiomyopathy and received an orthotopic heart transplantation on-• 2014. He 
developed end-stage renal disease and required haemodialysis in December 2018. His recent 
immunosuppressant regimen included tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil. Authors are not 
able to exclude the coincidence of COVID-1 9  vaccination and the development of 
posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) in this case. 
AstraZeneca comment: As authors have confirmed the pathogenesis of PTLD is closely 
associated with infection or reactivation of EBV in the context of chronic 
immunosuppression as the main predisposing factor. At the time of admission, the patient 
was on complex immunosuppressants and hemodialysis, which may predispose to the growth 
of lymphoma. EBV PCR of serum was negative 2 months before patient's admission to the 
clinic. There is limited information on circumstances leading to events, patient's baseline 
health status prior vaccination, the evaluation did not find evidence to suggest a causal 
relationship between EBV contamination and vaccine. The case was assessed as Possible (has 
alternative explanations, risk factors) according to WHO-UMC criteria. 
Summary 
Overall medical summary of all case reports 
Cumulatively through DLP 28 June 2022 a total of 56 reports of Viral reactivation (Non­
Zoster) with the use of V AXZEVRIA have been received, of which 92.9% of the reported 
events were serious. The age range was 22 to 88 years and mean and median age was 
reported as 5 1  years and 49.5 years, respectively. The cases were predominantly in females 
(55.4%). 
Of the 56 reports, 25.0% of cases of Viral reactivation (Non-Zoster) occurred after the first 
dose and 8.9% after the second dose. The dose number was unknown in 64.3% of cases. 
One case (1 .8%) was reported with a fatal outcome, however, the cause of death confirmed 
by autopsy was an ischaemic stroke, co-reported hepatitis B assessed by reporter as serious 
due to hospitalization, ischemic stroke was also assessed as a life-threatening event, a viral 
reactivation could not be comprehensively confirmed as there was insufficient information on 
previous HBV DNA status. Two more events were reported as life threatening. The first 
event of hepatitis E was reported as a life threatening, however, a viral reactivation could not 
be comprehensively confirmed as there was insufficient information on previous hepatitis E

history. The second event of herpes simplex encephalitis was reported by consumer as a life 
threatening, however, there is a limited information on patient concomitant medications and 
comorbidities that precluded a proper assessment. 
Of the 56 cases, 3 8  (67.9%) were assessed as "Possible with Limited information" and 13 
(23.2%) as "Possible with risk factors/confounders". One case (1 .8%) was considered 
"Probable-Likely". Although the patient had viral serology findings suggesting past infection 
ofEBV and CMV, both viruses are known to have latent and lytic phases. Reactivation of 
only one virus was seen (CMV) and can be explained by viral derived factors (such as its 
known natural history). The remaining four cases (7. 1 %) were assessed as "Unlikely". 
Of the four serious cases highlighted by PRAC reported to the French pharmacovigilance 
system, two were assessed as "Possible; with limited information", one as "Possible; with 
alternate cause or confounders", and one as "Unassessable/Unclassifiable with limited 
information". 
Overall, none of the case reports raised any new relevant safety concerns for Viral 
Reactivation (Non-zoster) cumulatively till 28 June 2022. 
Literature summary 
AstraZeneca performed a cumulative review of the literature in Embase, InsightMeme, and 
PubMed published from 29 December 2020 to 28 June 2022 identifying literature of viral 
reactivation in association with V AXZEVRIA and other COVID1 9  vaccines and 765 articles 
were identified. Of these, 758 articles were considered irrelevant for further evaluation and 
presentation based on the topic of interest "virus reactivation in association with 
V AXZEVRIA and other COVID1 9  vaccines". 
Seven literature case reports of viral reactivation were identified; the cases were reviewed as 
part of Global Safety Database review. On review of any remaining case report articles, no 
new safety concerns were identified. 
Conclusion 
Based on the review of the currently available cumulative data, AstraZeneca considers that 
there is insufficient evidence to suggest a causal association with V AXZEVRIA.It is 
AstraZeneca's opinion that no changes to the CDS or RMP on this topic are warranted at this 
time. Viral reactivation will continue to be monitored as part of AstraZeneca's routine 
surveillance activities. AstraZeneca will no longer discuss the topic future PBRERs, unless 
significant new safety information arises.

15.2.15  Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome 
AstraZeneca received the following requests from Health Canada on thrombosis with 
thrombocytopenia syndrome: 
As part of Health Canada 's efforts to minimize health risk factors to Canadians while 
maximizing the safety provided by the regulatory system for health products,  the Marketed 
Health Products Directorate (MHPD)  is conducting a comprehensive review on thrombosis 
with thrombocytopenia syndrome to determine whether there is a need for additional risk 
minimization measures in Canada for the V AXZEVRIA COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOxS-1 
[Recombinant]). 
In accordance with the Risk Management Plan Terms and Conditions, imposed under Section 
C. 01. 014.21 (1. 1) of the Food and Drug Regulations, AstraZeneca Canada Inc. is required to 
submit the following iriformation: 
Question 1 
Provide a Cumulative Review of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome including 
causality assessment of all individual reports from clinical trials, post-market use, and 
literature. 
a.  Review of data from ongoing clinical trials and observational studies stratified by age 
and gender, if possible. 
b.  Review of data from post-authorization use from all available sources including MAH 
safety database and published literature by age strata (18-29,  30-39, 40-49, 50-64, 
�65 years), sex,  dose received,  different dose interval, time to onset, outcomes, and 
any other relevant descriptive iriformation. 
c.  Brighton collaboration Case Definition and CDC Case Definition should be 
considered. 
d.  Use the WHO-UMC system for standardized case causality assessment. 
e.  Update of the Observed versus Expected analyses by age strata (18-29,  30-39,  40-49, 
50-64,  �65 years), and sex.

a.  There were no TTS events observed in the ongoing/completed V AXZEVRIA clinical 
trials (see section 7). Observational studies are discussed in Appendix 18, data from 
these studies showed increased risk of TTS following vaccination with the first dose 
ofV AXZEVRIA. The highest relative risk is observed in younger age groups 
(Andrews et al 2022; Higgins et al 2021). However, the risk associated with 
AZD1222 was much lower than following SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
b.  AstraZeneca has conducted a cumulative review of events of TTS in the AstraZeneca 
Global Patient Safety Database from post-authorization use and is presented in section 
1 6.3.2. 1 .  The analysis is stratified by age group (1 8-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-64, �65 
years), sex, dose. TTS case reports are classified by MHRA and CDC case 
definitions. Also O/E analysis with the requested age stratifications and reporting rate 
is provided. There are limitations of using data from post-marketing passive safety 
surveillance systems for the definitive adjudication of TTS cases. Such data are 
dependent on spontaneous case reports and the information provided by the reporter; 
access to follow-up data is typically very limited. It is therefore difficult to apply the 
criteria established for clinical purposes ( eg, the UK Expert Haematology Panel 
criteria or the Brighton Collaboration's TTS definition) to these spontaneous post­
marketing reports. 
c.  The Brighton collaboration Case Definition, CDC Case Definition and the case 
definition proposed by MHRA (which is described below in item "d") have been used 
in the review of this topic. As the MHRA case definition results in a larger number of 
cases being at least possible cases compared to the CDC definition, we consider this 
to be the most conservative and suitable definition to use in this context. We have not 
additionally applied the Brighton collaboration Case Definition as the O/E analysis 
includes all reported cases within the relevant risk window regardless of diagnostic 
certainty. 
d.  With regard to the request to provide a cumulative review of TTS case reports using 
the WHO-UMC system for standardized case causality assessment, instead, 
AstraZeneca has an agreed approach with the MHRA to judge individual case 
assessments based on the criteria in the table below, which is combined with an 
observed vs expected analysis (which also includes all cases regardless of diagnostic 
certainty). This has also been applied in our routine updates on the topic to EMA.

Although assessment of individual case definition for TTS is independent from assessment of 
individual case causality, we consider this approach to be a more suitable and evidence-based 
approach to evaluate and quantify the risk ofTTS (and, as noted above, applying the MHRA 
definition results in a more conservative assessment than the CDC definition). We therefore 
have utilized this approach, rather than the WHO-UMC causality criteria, to foster a more 
aligned regulatory assessment on this topic.

Question 2 
Discuss new information about mechanism of action, clinical definition, risk factors, at risk 
groups, long-term sequelae, clinical management, fatality rate, and risk minimization. 
AstraZeneca's Response 
Mechanism of action: The exact mechanism of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia 
syndrome (TTS) following immunisation with V AXZEVRIA is unknown. New information 
on biological mechanism ofTTS was discussed in the EMA workshop on thrombosis with 
thrombocytopenia syndrome EMA 2022. 
Cohen 2022 (AstraZeneca) hypothesized that ChAdOxl -PF4 complexes are recognized by 
pre-existing B-cell clones encoding "pathogenic" anti-PF4 IgG. The boosted production of 
TTS inducing anti-PF4 antibodies (IgG) subsequently triggers thrombosis via activation of 
platelets and neutrophils. Also, vaccination with V AXZEVRIA does not increase anti-PF4 
levels in healthy vaccine recipients. This is in line with the in vitro binding data between PF4 
and ChAdOx 1 reported by Baker et al 202 1 .  The anti-PF 4 IgG will then lead to the 
downstream activation cascade as it has been shown that IgG from TTS patients is capable of 
activating platelets and neutrophils and inducing thrombosis in a murine model 
(hFcyRIIa/hPF4) Chong et al 202 1 .

Baker et al 2021 ,  demonstrated the binding of three adenoviruses (Ad5, ChadOxl and Ad26) 
to PF4. Computational modelling and Brownian dynamic simulations indicated that the 
interactions are not randomly distributed over the virion surface but mainly occur at the 
interfaces between hexons. Othman et al 2022 discuss possible mechanisms of how 
adenoviral vectors may cause rare VITT. (1): Adenovirus leaks into bloodstream following 
intramuscular injection of the vaccine, directly binds to platelet via Coxsackie and adenovirus 
receptor (CAR), and/or secondary receptors present on platelets, inducing platelet activation 
and triggering coagulation as well as liver clearance of activated platelets and 
thrombocytopenia. (2). The binding of adenovirus to coagulation factors such as factor X 
(FX), their potential activation thus triggering clot formation. (3). "Vaccine induced COVID 
mimicry" resulting from vaccine induced secretion of mis-spliced, C-terminal truncated spike 
protein into the blood, activating endothelial cells through ACE2. This initiates vascular 
inflammation and damage with consequent platelet activation, thrombotic events and platelet 
factor 4 (PF4) release. (4). Binding of adenovirus capsid to PF4. The adenovirus/PF4 
complex stimulates pre-existing memory B cells against PF4, the IgG/PF4 complex then 
binds to Fey-receptor IIA (FcyRIIa) and stimulates platelet activation, and clot formation. (5). 
PF4-adenovirus complexes are internalized by B cells that recognize PF4. These B cells 
present adenoviral peptides via major histocompatibility complex class II, which are 
recognized pre-existing anti-vector CD4+ T cells that in turn provide T cell help to B cells, 
and drive their production of anti-PF4 antibodies that can stimulate platelets via FcyRIIa. (6). 
Impurities of human or non-structural viral proteins in vaccine preparation triggering 
autoantibodies such as anti-PF4m which stimulates platelet activation and clot formation. (7). 
Acute infection with SARS-CoV-2 following vaccine administration, modified/atypical 
COVID-1 9, presented with thrombosis and thrombocytopenia. 
Huynh et al 2021 demonstrated that the binding of anti-PF 4 antibodies from patients with 
VITT was restricted to eight surface amino acids on PF4, all of which were located within the 
heparin-binding site, and that the binding was inhibited by heparin. By contrast, antibodies 
from patients with HIT bound to amino acids that corresponded to two different sites on PF4. 
Authors demonstrated that VITT antibodies are distinct from HIT antibodies, despite the 
apparent phenotypical similarity of the two diseases. These results provide an explanation for 
VITT-antibody-induced platelet activation that could contribute to thrombosis. For more 
details see section 1 6.3. 
Clinical Case definition and clinical management guidelines: Consensus on the definition 
ofTTS is needed to enable consistent analysis and interpretation of existing and emerging 
data. Currently available clinical definitions and treatment guidelines are provided in below

Long-term sequelae: A literature search was carried out, however, no information was 
available on long-term sequelae. 
Fatality rate: Fatality rate stratified by month/year, age, gender and region are presented in 
Table 14 and Figure 2 in Section 1 6.3.2. 1 .  
Risk minimization: there are no additional risk minimization measures for TTS during the 
reporting interval. Routine risk minimisation measures are considered appropriately discussed 
in section 4.3, 4.4 and 4.8 of the CDS and RMP. 
Question 3 
Provide an assessment of the benefits and the risks, stratified by sex and age, for the use of 
the V AXZEVRIA  vaccine in the current Canadian context,  taking into consideration disease 
projections and the epidemiology of circulating variants, and post-market reports of rare 
thrombotic events associated with thrombocytopenia. 
AstraZeneca's Response 
AstraZeneca conducted a targeted benefit-risk analysis presented below, which is based on 
real-world COVID-1 9  case, hospitalization, and death rates publicly available from the CDC, 
external published estimates of AZD1222 vaccine effectiveness against the Omicron and 
Delta variants, and AstraZeneca data regarding occurrences of TTS after AZD1222 
administration. The results indicate that when administered as a 2-dose primary series, the 
benefits of AZD1222 continue to outweigh the serious (albeit rare) risks ofTTS. While this 
favourable benefit: risk profile was seen across all groups 1 8  years of age and older, it is 
particularly evident in individuals 65 years of age and older. 
Analysis Methods and Assumptions 
Benefit 
To evaluate the expected benefits of AZD1222 vaccination, the primary analysis estimates 
numbers of symptomatic COVID-1 9  cases, COVID-1 9  hospitalisations, and COVID-1 9  
deaths that would be prevented over a 6-month period if 1 million adults received 2 priming 
doses of AZD1222. Benefits were estimated separately in adults � 1 8, � 30, � 50 and � 65 
years of age, with the proportion of adults in each age group reflective of the age-structure of 
the US population (ACS 2020). 
To model the benefits of primary vaccination with AZD1222 during an Omicron or Delta 
wave, the period when Omicron was dominant (01 January 22 - ongoing) and the period 
when Delta was dominant (01 July 2 1  - 1 5  December 21) were identified (GISAID 2022). 
Average, age-specific event rates ( cases, hospitalizations, deaths) were then calculated for 
each period. Rates for cases and deaths were obtained from Data.CDC.gov (CDC 2022). 
Hospitalization rates were obtained from COVID-NET (COVID-NET 2022).

Due to data availability, hospitalization and death rates were reported up to 26 February 2022 
and case rates were reported up to 1 9  March 2022. Thus the period used to derive average 
event rates for an Omicron wave began on 01 January 2022 and ended on 1 9  March 2022 
(though in fact the current Omicron wave is ongoing). Given that Omicron was trending 
upwards in March 2022, hospitalizations and death rates associated with Omicron may be 
underestimated relative to symptomatic cases overall. 
An independent meta-analysis of clinical trials and real-world studies conducted by IHME 
(IHME 2022) provided the estimates of vaccine effectiveness used in our model. For a 
complete, two-dose primary series of AZD1222, the VE estimates assuming an Omicron 
wave (and regardless of age threshold) were 36% against symptomatic COVID-1 9  and 71% 
against severe COVID-19. For a Delta wave, the VE estimates were 69% against 
symptomatic COVID-1 9  and 94% against severe COVID-19. Numbers of prevented cases 
were calculated as follows: 
Number of Deaths I Hospitalizations 
Rate ofCOVID-19 deaths/hospitalizations/cases 
X Estimated 
(for cases) X 6 months X 1 million 
I Cases prevented 
VE against severe 
disease 
persons. 
= 
in unvaccinated 
individuals 
(for deaths and hospitalizations
) or symptomatic 
COVID-19 
Sensitivity analyses were conducted to account for: 
•  Potentially lower VE in older adults (we assumed 1 0% lower VE in adults � 65 years of 
age), 
•  Waning of VE over six months (we assumed a 20% reduction in estimated VE against 
symptomatic COVID-1 9  and a 1 0% reduction in estimated VE against severe COVID-
1 9), and 
•  Extreme waning of VE over six months (we assumed an 85% reduction in estimated VE 
against symptomatic COVID-1 9  and a 20% reduction in estimated VE against severe 
COVID-1 9). 
Risk 
Estimates of the expected risks of TTS, TCP/ITP, TM, and GBS for adults � 1 8, � 30, � 50 
and � 65 years of age were based on events reported to and vaccines administered in the UK, 
EU, Brazil, and Australia up to 1 5  March 2022. 
•  TTS was defined according to CDC criteria, tiers 1 and 2 (CDC 2021) 
As the risk of TTS has been observed to vary by dose (Bhuyan et al 2021), rates were 
reported separately per million first and second doses. Risk rates for TTS were calculated as: 
(Reported events 
I Number of V AXZEVRIA doses administered
) X 1 million 
first or second 
doses. 
When reporting fatal TTS, the date of death was conservatively assumed to be the same as 
the date of the corresponding event onset.

Where the categorization of vaccination exposures by age in a data set did not align with the 
thresholds presented above (eg, 350,000 vaccination exposures for the category 25 - 34 years 
of age), the exposures were assumed to be evenly distributed (eg, 35,000 vaccinations per 
age-year) and only the relevant exposures (eg,  175,000 vaccinations for the age-years 30 
through 34) included in the relevant (eg, � 30 years) analysis threshold. 
Age was unknown for a small number of individuals in the UK and EU data sets (0.3% and 
2.9%, respectively). For all benefit and risk calculations, these individuals were included in 
all age thresholds. 
Results 
Primary Analysis 
Results of the benefit:risk analysis assuming the Omicron variant predominates are presented 
in Figure 4. The number of COVID-1 9  cases averted after receiving the full vaccination 
series of AZD1222 was similar for all age thresholds. However, the number of COVID-1 9  
hospitalizations prevented increased from 1 6,922 when the age threshold was � 1 8  years to 
52,424 when the age threshold was � 65 years. Similarly, the number of COVID-1 9  deaths 
prevented increased from 4, 152 when the age threshold was � 1 8  years to 17, 123 when the 
age threshold was � 65 years. Hence the benefits of receiving a primary series of AZD1222 
were overwhelmingly most evident when the age threshold was � 65 years. 
The risk of vaccination-associated TTS did not increase with age. Across the age spectrum, 
the number of TTS cases after AZD1222 vaccination (using the CDC definition) was 4-5. 
Based on these findings on the Omicron variant, AstraZeneca concludes that the benefits of 
V AXZEVRIA outweigh the risks across all ages, with particular benefits observed in those 
over the age of 65.

With the Delta variant predominating (Figure 5), benefit:risk analysis yields results similar to 
those described for Omicron, even though the Delta variant is associated with a lower 
average event rate and higher VE estimates. Based on these findings on the Delta variant, 
AstraZeneca concludes that the benefits of V AXZEVRIA outweigh the risks across all ages, 
with particular benefits observed in those over the age of 65.

Sensitivity Analyses 
When sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the potential impacts on vaccination 
benefit of: 
1 0% lower estimated VE in individuals � 65 years of age, 
• 
•  Waning of estimated VE over 6 months by 20% (cases) and 10% ( severe disease), and 
•  Extreme waning of estimated VE over 6 months by 85% (cases) and 20% (severe 
disease), 
fewer cases of symptomatic disease were prevented but there was little impact on prevention 
of hospitalizations or deaths in any age threshold. 
Results for the threshold � 65 years of age are shown in Figure 6 (assuming predominance of 
the Omicron variant) and in Figure 7 (assuming predominance of the Delta variant).

V AXZEVRIA continue to outweigh the risk of TTS in individuals 65 years of age and older. 
The benefits were seen whether the model assumed predominance of the Omicron or the 
Delta variant, and persisted when reduced estimates of VE were used (10% reduction for all 
individuals � 65 years of age, waning over 6 months by 20% ( cases) and 10% (severe 
disease), or extreme waning over 6 months by 85% (cases) and 20% (severe disease). 
Therefore, AstraZeneca concludes that the benefits of V AXZEVRIA outweigh the risks 
across all ages, with particular benefits observed in those over the age of 65. 
Question 4 
Conduct a comprehensive root-cause analysis of the risk of thrombosis with 
thrombocytopenia syndrome.  The analysis should include the potential mechanism action, 
biological plausibility, risk factors (including the role of exercise) and the impact of the 
vaccination interval (booster dose). 
AstraZeneca's Response 
The exact mechanism/ biological plausibility/risk factors of thrombosis with concurrent 
thrombocytopenia following immunisation with V AXZEVRIA are unknown, please see 
Question 2 AstraZeneca response for more details. Analysis of booster dose is presented in 
Section 1 6.3.2. 1. 
Question 5 
Include a discussion of the background rate of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome 
as well as a discussion of this condition following COVID-19 disease. 
AstraZeneca's Response 
The background incidence of TTS used in our 0/E and other analysis of the topic is derived 
from the data sources outlined below from the pre-pandemic period. We have not identified a 
suitable data source from which to derive an overall background incidence of TTS in the 
pandemic period (ie, during 2020 prior to use of the vaccine) or a specific incidence of TTS 
following COVID-1 9  infection or disease. Whilst there is a body of evidence regarding the 
risk of thrombosis and/or thrombocytopenia following COVID-1 9  disease (eg, Iba and Levy 
2022) these studies have not specifically evaluated TTS as per the relevant case definition 
used in our analyses. 
In the context of our 0/E analyses on this topic, we consider that use of the pre-pandemic 
background incidence is suitably conservative, since any pandemic period incidence, if 
different, is more likely to be higher rather lower than the pre-pandemic incidence. 
Background rates for thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome: Data on background 
rates are available from internal analyses conducted by AstraZeneca and from literature. 
AstraZeneca study using US claims data (Mullerova et al; Soboleva et al 2022): Pre­
pandemic background TTS rates were generated via secondary data analysis using a cohort 
design in the IBM Truven MarketScan® US health insurance claims database, from 1 January 
to 3 1  December 2019. No single diagnosis code for TTS exists, TTS was defined based on 
thrombocytopenia and thrombotic/ thromboembolic claims. Thrombotic/thromboembolic

events included all venous and arterial thrombotic events and pulmonary embolism except 
acute myocardial infarction or overall "stroke". Two algorithms were applied: 
thrombocytopenia occurring ± 7 days ( algorithm 1) or occurring 1 day prior to ::; 14 days after 
the thrombotic/thromboembolic event (algorithm 2) (Soboleva et al 2022). 
In this  analysis,  pre-pandemic  background  TTS  incidence  was  estimated  as  9.8-1 1 . 1   per 
1 00,000 person-years. When standardised to a 2 1 -day risk window, incident TTS event rates 
(95% CI) with algorithms  1 and 2 were 5.6 (5.3 to 6.0) and 6.4 (6.0 to 6.8) per l M  persons/2 1-
days,  respectively  (Table 1 52).  Event  rates  were  higher  in  males  and  increased  with  age. 
Similar patterns were observed with both algorithms. 
Literature 
Published event rates for TTS by specific thrombotic/thromboembolic sites show substantial 
heterogeneity.  For example, across 7 databases  from 5  European countries, Bum et al.2022. 
reported pre-pandemic background rates (per 100 000 person-years) of 1 .0-8.5 for DVT with 
thrombocytopenia,  0.5- 20.8  for  PE  with  thrombocytopenia,  0. 1- 2.5  for  SVT  with 
thrombocytopenia,  and  1 .0-43.4  for  myocardial  infarction  or  ischemic  stroke  with 
thrombocytopenia.  This  heterogeneity  may  be  due  to  different  methods  of  estimating 
background event rates between studies and/or differences in diagnostic or recording patterns 
in  selected  countries/regions.  Variability  in  case  definitions,  their  coding,  and  timeframes 
covered by the databases used were also likely  contributing  factors. None  of the published 
studies provided an  overall  TTS  event rate, but instead reported  individual  types  of acute 
thrombosis/thromboembolism  in  combination  with  thrombocytopenia.  (Bum  et  al.2022; 
Laporte  et  al  202 1 ;   Willame  et  al  2021)  TTS  cases  may  present  with  multiple 
thrombotic/thromboembolic sites, a single case could be counted several times in each of the 
thrombotic/thromboembolic event analyses, confounding an observed to expected analysis.

Conclusions 
Summary 
Although AstraZeneca's position is that a reasonable possibility of a 
causal association does not exist between V AXZEVRIA and GBS at 
this time, AstraZeneca acknowledges the  1432 case reports in our 
Safety database, the published evidence, and the increased O/E ratio in 
some categories amidst the complexities including the role of 
COVID-19 possibly causing GBS in the background. However, the 
available data on GBS  is mainly from spontaneously reported cases, 
which are voluntary and often have limited information or have 
predisposing / confounding factors for GBS. Four (4) out of 1432 cases 
were considered "Probable" according WHO-UMC criteria, despite 
having some missing information as explained above. The incidence 
rates that are used for the O/E analyses are conservative, as other 
reliable sources have higher rates. In addition, the rates are since pre-
pandemic times and not accounting for the COVID-19 pandemic in the 
background. 
Although there are epidemiological articles describing a temporal 
association to the first dose of V AXZEVRIA, the risk was 
approximately 4 times greater after a COVID-19 infection. Therefore, 
there are still gaps in understanding on the incidence rate of GBS in the 
context of the effect of COVID-19 pandemic in the background. 
Taking this into consideration, AstraZeneca will continue to closely 
monitor GBS as part of our surveillance activities and take further 
actions as deemed necessary.

All the 89 cases were serious. Out of 89 cases 49 were medically confirmed. The reported seriousness 
criteria  for  the  89  serious  cases  of  CYST  without  thrombocytopenia  included:  death  (13), 
life-threatening  (2 1 ), hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization ( 54 ), persistent or 
significant disability or incapacity (2) and medically significant  (44).  A single  case may have met 
more than one criterion for serious. 
A majority of the cases, 33 (37%), were reported from Germany; followed by the UK with 1 1  
(12%) cases. A total of 62 (70%) case reports were reported in females, 26 (29%) were reported in 
males, and in the remaining 1 (1 %) the gender was not reported. The median age was 45.5 years, 
with a range of 20 to 90 years. Of 89 reported cases, 64 (72%) occurred in adults (18 to 64 years of 
age), 12 (13%) in elderly (� 65 years of age) and in the remaining 1 3  (15%) the age was not 
reported. 
Of the 89 cases, time to onset from the administration of vaccine to the onset of the CYST event 
was available in 60 (67%) cases as follows: 0 to 7 days in 1 8  (20%); 8 to 14 days in 15 (17%); 1 5  to 
21 days in 4 (4%); 22 to 28 days in 3 (3%); 29 to 42 days in 8 (9%) and, greater than 42 days in 
12 (14%) cases. Time to onset was not reported in the remaining 29 (33%) cases. Time to onset 
ranged from O to 301 days, with a median of 12.5 days. 
The outcomes of the 89 CYST without thrombocytopenia cases were as follows: 26 (29.2%) were 
not recovered; 20 (22.4%) were recovering,  14 (15.8%) recovered; 6 (6.7%) recovered with 
sequelae; 1 3  (14.6%) died; and the remaining 10 cases ( 1 1 .3%) had unknown outcomes. 
Of the 89 case reports, 1 3  (14.6%) cases had a reported fatal outcome (7 initial and 6 follow-up

Of the 1 3  fatal outcome cases, the reported causes of death were: Cerebral venous thrombosis (5), 
Syncope (4), Death (2), Cerebral haemorrhage (2), Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (1), Brain 
injury (1), Subarachnoid haemorrhage (1), Cavernous sinus thrombosis (1). Four cases had > 1 
reported cause of death. 
AstraZeneca 
25 August 2022 
Of the 89 cases, there were 76 cases in which the vaccinee received first dose of vaccine and the 
event occurred post dose  1 .  A majority of these cases, 56 (73.6%) out of 76, occurred in the 20 to 65 
age group (median 43 years), and 55 (72.3%) of the 76 cases were in female vaccinees. The time to 
onset was available in 52 case reports with a median of 1 1  days (Range: 0-284 days). The time to 
onset from the administration of dose 1 to the event onset was: 0 to 2 1  days in 36 (69.2%), 22 to 28 
days in 2 (3.8%), 29 to 42 days in 6 (1 1 .5%), and greater than 42 days in 8 (1 5.3%) of cases. Time 
to onset was not reported in 24 cases. 
Of the 89 cases, there were  12 cases in which the vaccinee received 2 doses of vaccine and the 
event occurred post 2nd dose. A majority of these cases, 10 (83.3%) out of 12, occurred in the 28 to 
65 age group (median 43.5 years), and 7 (58.3%) of the 12 cases were in female vaccinees. The 
time to onset was available in 8 case reports (Range: 2-301 days). The time to onset from the 
administration of dose 2 to the event onset was: 0 to 2 1  days in 1 (12.5%), 22 to 28 days in 1 
(12.5%), 29 to 42 days in 2 (25%), and greater than 42 days in 4 (50%) of cases. Time to onset was 
not reported in 4 cases. 
Out of the 1 1  cases in vaccinees who developed CYST after Dose 2, 1 case reported a fatal 
outcome. Reported age in fatal case was  63 years and the cause of death was reported as Cavernous 
sinus thrombosis, Subarachnoid haemorrhage and Cerebral haemorrhage. The time to onset for the 
fatal case was 41 days. 
Out of the 1 1  cases, in 1 case patient received COVID-1 9  messenger RNA (mRNA) Vaccine 
Biontech (tozinameran) as the second dose and experienced a CYST event after receiving the 
second dose 
is discussed below: 
• 
:  A  spontaneous  report  has  been  received  from the  regulatory  authority  in 
- (EMA) regarding  a 62-year-old female patient who was reported to have received 
VAXZEVRIA  Dose  1  and  98  days  after  Dose  1 ,  patient  received  Dose  2  (COVID-1 9  
VACCINE  PFIZER).  Approximately  5  months  after,  Dose  2  (COVID-1 9   VACCINE 
PFIZER),  the  vaccinee  experienced cerebral  venous  sinus thrombosis.  No  information on 
treatment provided and the event was ongoing at the time of the report was received. 
AZ Comment: The time to onset from the V AXZEVRIA dose was 8 months (240 days), which is 
clearly outside of the risk window of 42 days. AstraZeneca considers a causal relationship between 
V AXZEVRIA and the event as unlikely. In addition, there are missing information of medical 
history and concomitant medication. 
In another case the vaccinee reported to have received COVID-1 9  messenger RNA (mRNA) 
Vaccine Biontech (tozinameran) as the second dose and third dose with the CYST related event 
occurring on an unknown exact date. This case is described below:

Periodic Benefit-Risk Evaluation Report 
COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOxl -S [recombinant]) 
AstraZeneca 
25 August 2022 
:  A spontaneous report has been received from a physician via the regulatory 
authority in- (EMA) regarding a 52-year-old male patient who was reported to have 
received V AXZEVRIA Dose 1 on 06 March 202 1 ,  after 84 days from Dose 1, patient received 
Dose 2 (COVID-1 9  VACCINE PFIZER) on 29 May 202 1 and received Dose 3 (COVID-1 9  
VACCINE  PFIZER)  on  1 0  December  202 1 .  On  an  unknown  date  in  202 1 ,  the  vaccinee 
experienced cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. 
AZ Comment: The time to onset is unknown in this case. AstraZeneca considers the case 
unassessable with limited information. Missing information are those of medical history and 
concomitant medication. 
There were no cases with a recurrence noted (after the first and second dose of the vaccine). Twenty 
two (24.2%) cases out of 89 had radiological confirmation of CYST, and 14 (15.7%) of the 22 cases 
were medically confirmed. 
Of the 89 cases,  1 0  cases had co-reported cerebrovascular events (such as Cerebral haemorrhage 
(5), Cerebrovascular accident (4), Subarachnoid haemorrhage (1) 
There was information available on confounding comorbidities, other medical confounders or risk 
factors and confounding medications reported in 2 1  (23.5%) of the 89 cases. Out of the remaining 
68 cases, 38 cases had no information on confounding/risk factors and in 30 cases, although with 
various risk factors, but none was assessed to be particular or pertinent to the occurrence of 
cerebrovascular pathology. A single case may have more than one risk/confounding factor. Details 
of the WHO-UMC causality assessment are provided in Table 1 58. 
The confounding factors reported for the cases were concomitant use of contraceptives, 
cancer/neoplasms, deep vein thrombosis, history of thrombosis, COVID-1 9  illness prior to vaccine, 
hypertension, fibromyalgia, cerebrovascular accident. None of the cases met WHO-UMC criteria as 
'Certain' and 'Probable-Likely'. 
Cumulative review (29 December 2020 - 28 June 2022) 
Cumulatively,  573  cases with CYST without thrombocytopenia were received from vaccinees who 
received V AXZEVRIA. Out of the 573 case reports,  1  case was  from the clinical trial, 25 literature 
cases, 3 cases from non-interventional/post-marketing and 544 cases are from spontaneous sources. 
Of the 573 case reports, 566 were reported as serious and 7 were reported as non-serious; 340 were 
medically  confirmed.  The  seriousness  criteria  for  the  573  serious  cases  of  CYST  without 
thrombocytopenia  included:  death  (46),  life-threatening  (127),  hospitalization  or  prolongation  of 
existing  hospitalization  (360),  Congenital  anomaly  (1 ),  persistent  or  significant  disability  or 
incapacity (38), and medically significant (300). A single case may have met more than one criterion 
for serious. 
A majority of the cases, 1 94 (34%) were reported from Germany and 154 (27%) cases were reported 
from UK. A total of 350 (61 %)  case reports were reported in females,  203  (35%) were reported in 
males, and in 20 (4%) the gender was not reported. The median age was 5 1  years with a range of 1 8  
to 9 8  years. Out of 573 reported cases, 388 (68%) occurred in adults (1 8-64 years o f  age), 123 (2 1 %) 
in elderly (� 65 years of age), and in 62 (1 1 %) the age was not reported.

None of the cases met WHO-UMC criteria as 'Certain'. 
There was available information on confounding comorbidities, other medical confounders or risk 
factors and confounding medications reported in 1 99 (34.7%) of the 573 cases. Out of the 
remaining 374 cases, 322 cases had no information on any confounding/risk factor and in 52 cases 
there were no relevant risk factors identified. A single case may have more than one 
risk/confounding factor. 
The confounding factors reported for the cases were concomitant use of contraceptives, 
cancer/neoplasms, history of obesity, deep vein thrombosis, history of thrombosis, COYID-1 9  
illness prior to vaccine, Factor Y Leiden mutation, hypertension, pulmonary embolism, 
immunodeficiency, fibromyalgia, and autoimmune thyroiditis. 
Review of Literature (29 December 2021 - 28 June 2022) 
AstraZeneca performed a search for the period 29 December 2021 to 28 June 2022 of PubMed, 
Embase and InsightMeme databases to identify literature of CYST with COYID-1 9  vaccines, 
including Y AXZEVRIA. 
A total of285 articles were retrieved from the search of which 29 were duplicates and 256 were 
unique articles. Of the 256 articles, 5 articles included 5 literature cases of CYST without 
Thrombocytopenia with Y AXZEVRIA included in the review above 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY 
419 of715

. The remaining 25 1 articles were not 
considered as relevant and therefore will not be discussed (as they discussed CYST in the context of 
VITT, TTS, or CYST with thrombocytopenia; contained information on unspecified COVID-1 9  
vaccines; or did not provide sufficient information to make a meaningful assessment). 
Observed versus Expected Analysis 
Please refer to Appendix 8 for the methodology of the O/E analyses and Appendix 9 for any additional 
sensitivity analysis. 
The observed versus expected analyses for all cases of CYST without thrombocytopenia are carried 
out using incidence rates from ACCESS: SIDIAP PCHOSP and Truven MarketScan (201 9). The 
observed versus expected analysis for all cases of CYST without thrombocytopenia is presented 
with different risk windows (21 days, 30 days and 42 days) for all global reports in Table 1 59 and 
stratified by age for the EEA, UK, Australia and Brazil regions in Table 1 60 and by age and gender 
in UK (Table 161 and Table 1 62). Global analysis also included cases with an unknown time to 
onset, as a conservative approach. The incidence rates used were from SIDIAP _PCHOSP (Willame 
et al 2021  [B]), as that rate was used by the EMA, and this would permit a comparison of the O/E 
analysis conducted by EMA and AstraZeneca. 
SIDIAP PCHOSP is a data source containing 5.7 million (80% of the population) in Catalonia and 
includes General Practitioner (GP) medical records, communication from specialists and 
hospitalization discharge diagnoses. SIDIAP PCHOSP is representative of the general population in 
terms of age, sex, and geographic distribution. Since CYST is a very rare event, a larger database 
was used in addition to SIDIAP PCHOSP. Truven MarketScan (US) was chosen since is a 
longitudinal database capturing outcomes from in- and outpatient visits and pharmaceuticals and 
contains almost 230 million unique patients. Moreover, it includes both commercial employer­
based insurance and government-based insurance. In addition to its large sample size Truven 
MarketScan was used for consistency with background rates for TTS generated using MarketScan. 
As a comparison to the above, the same observed versus expected analyses are carried out using 
incidence rates from Truven MarketScan. Those analyses for CYST are presented with different 
risk windows (21 days, 30 days and 42 days) for all global reports in Table 1 63, stratified by age in 
the EEA, UK, Australia and Brazil in Table  1 64 and by age and gender in the UK (Table 1 65 and 
Table 1 66). 
Conservatively, the exposure for global reports (4483061 52) is based on doses administered in 13 
markets as explained in Appendix 8.

COVID-19 Vaccine (ChAdOxl -S [recombinant]) 
25 August 2022 
When an overall rate of 0. 72/100,000 person years from SIDIAP _ HOSP is used, observed cases of 
CVST without thrombocytopenia are significantly more than expected for all risk windows except 
for risk window of 42 days. Observed cases were significantly more than expected for all risk 
windows when an unknown time to onset was included. 
In comparison, when Truven 14 IR are used, observed cases are significantly less than expected for 
all the risk windows, when cases with unknown TTO are excluded. When cases with an unknown 
TTO are included to all risk windows as a conservative approach, observed cases are significantly 
more than expected for risk window 2 1  days, however observed cases were significantly less than 
expected for 30- and 42-days risk window (Table 1 67). 
When the observed versus expected analysis was stratified by age in the EEA, UK, Australia and 
Brazil region using SIDIAP _ HOSP rates, observed cases were less than expected for age groups 50-
59 (for risk window 30 and 42 days). For all other age stratifications and risk windows of 2 1 ,  30 
and 42 days in EEA, UK, Australia and Brazil region using SIDIAP _ HOSP rates observed cases 
were either more or significantly more than expected (Table 1 68). 
In comparison, when observed versus expected analysis was stratified by age in the EEA, UK, 
Australia and Brazil region using Truven 14 IRs, observed cases are more or significantly more than 
expected in all age groups from 1 8-69 and over 70 years for risk windows 2 1  days. In risk window 
of 30 days, observed cases are more or significantly more than expected in age groups from 1 8-59 
and in age group over 70 years and observed cases are less than expected in age group 60-69 years 
for risk window of 30 days. For risk window of 42 days, observed cases were significantly less than 
expected for age groups of 1 8-49, 60-69 and observed cases were either more or significantly more 
than expected for age groups 50-59 and over 70 years (Table 1 68). 
When stratified by age and gender in the UK, using Truven 14 IRs (Table 1 69), the observed cases 
divided between males and females as follows: 
For females, observed cases were more or significantly more than expected for the age groups 1 8-
59 and 70-79 years and observed cases were less or significantly less than expected for the age 
groups 60-69 and over 80 for 2 1  days risk window. Observed cases were more or significantly more 
than expected for the age groups 1 8-29, 40-49, 50-59, 70-79 years and observed cases were less or 
significantly less than expected for the age groups 30-39, 60-69 and over 80 years for 30 and 42 
days risk window. 
For males, observed cases were less or significantly less than expected for age groups 60-69, 70-79 
and over 80 years age group for all risk windows (2 1 ,  30 and 42 days). For all other age 
stratifications observed cases were either more or significantly more than expected for all risk 
windows (2 1 ,  30 and 42 days). 
Observed versus expected analyses for CVST without thrombocytopenia (with known normal 
platelet count) 
Information on normal platelets was available in 1 1 1  of the 573 cases. In the remaining 462 of the 
573 cases the post-vaccination platelet count was unknown, however no thrombocytopenia-related

PTs were reported. The 1 1 1  cases were used for observed versus expected analysis in order to 
represent the dataset with known normal thrombocytes. 
AstraZeneca 
25 August 2022 
The observed versus expected analysis for all 1 1 1  cases of CVST without thrombocytopenia is 
presented with different risk windows (21 days, 30 days and 42 days) for global reports in 
Table 1 67 and stratified by age in the EEA, UK, Australia and Brazil region in Table 1 68 and age 
groups in UK Table 1 69. The incidence rates used were from SIDIAP PCHOSP (Willame et al 
2021  [B]), as that rate was used by the EMA, and this would permit a comparison of the O/E 
analysis conducted by EMA and AstraZeneca. All stratifications are provided with and without 
cases that have an unknown time to onset. 
The O/E analysis for CVST without thrombocytopenia (with known normal thrombocytes) showed 
that the number of observed cases were significantly lower than expected when overall cases were 
considered. With the stratified O/E analysis by age and gender, there were certain age and gender 
groups where the observed number was higher than expected. However, when a qualitative review 
was conducted, many of the cases were missing information such as medical history, concomitant 
medications, precluding a proper assessment to determine causal relationship.

As a comparison to the above, the same observed versus expected analyses are carried out using 
incidence rates from Truven MarketScan. That approach is aligned with incidence rates routinely 
used for TTS 0/E monitoring. In particular, the time window for exclusion of patients with TCP 
(either -7/+7 or-1/+ 14) was consistent with the one used for TTS. In this analysis, a conservative 
approach in terms of lCD l O  codes for CYST (163.6 and 167.6) was used. Also, the analysis included 
only incident (no CYST claims within 1 2  months prior to index) inpatient claims. Those analyses 
for CYST are presented with different risk windows (21 days, 30 days, and 42 days) for all global 
reports in Table 1 70, stratified by age in the EEA, UK, Australia and Brazil region in Table 1 7 1 ,  
stratified by age in UK in Table 1 72and gender (Female and Male) in the UK Table 1 73 and Table 
1 74. All stratifications also included cases with an unknown TTO, as a conservative approach. 
The 0/E analysis for CYST without thrombocytopenia (with known normal thrombocytes) using 
incidence rates from Truven MarketScan showed that the number of observed cases were 
significantly lower than expected when overall and also cases from EEA, UK, Brazil and Australia 
were considered. With the stratified 0/E analysis by age and gender, there were certain age and 
gender groups (50-59 years in UK for all risk windows including unknown TTO, 1 8-49 years in UK 
for risk window of 2 1  days, only when unknown TTO is considered) where the observed number 
was higher than expected. However, when a qualitative review was conducted, many of the cases 
were missing information such as medical history, concomitant medications, precluding a proper 
assessment to determine causal relationship.

Summary: 
AstraZeneca 
25 August 2022 
AstraZeneca continued to review the safety information for CVST without thrombocytopenia 
from sources including clinical trials, post-marketing reports, and the published literature for 
the reporting period. 
There were no reports of CVST without thrombocytopenia related AEs in the Oxford pooled 
studies. There was 1 report of Cerebral venous/Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis identified in 
the V AXZEVRIA group in US Study (D8 1 1  0C0000 1 ), however, there was no new safety 
information received in the reporting period. 
A review of the post-marketing data did not identify any index case or a new safety signal. 
There were no case reports with positive re-challenge (after the first and second dose of the 
vaccine). There are 573 and 89 cases for the cumulative and reporting period respectively. 
Cumulatively, there was a preponderance for female gender (61 %) versus males (35%), and 
68% cases were in age group 1 8-64 years. Twelve (12) fatal cases (92%) out of all 13 fatal 
cases (in all age groups) were reported in females in the reporting period. Cumulatively, 28 
(60.8%) out of all 46 fatal cases were reported in females. There was no significant difference 
noted between the cumulative and reporting period in terms of the volume and distribution of 
cases. 
A review of the published literature did not identify any new safety information on this topic 
in association with V AXZEVRIA. 
The Observed versus Expected analysis was carried out using incidence rates from ACCESS: 
SIDIAP PCHOSP and Truven MarketScan (201 9). SIDIAP PCHOSP is representative of the 
general population in terms of age,  sex, and geographic distribution and that the rate was used 
by the EMA, and this would permit a comparison of the 0/E analysis conducted by EMA, 
whereas Truven MarketScan was used for consistency with background rates for TTS 
generated using MarketScan. The results showed observed cases are more than expected in the 
general population globally. The age stratifications suggest that the 0/E ratio is higher in 
younger age groups than in the older age groups and that the 0/E ratio is higher in females 
than in males. However, it is important to note that 0/E analyses are complementary to routine 
signal detection methods, and are not designed to determine a causal relationship; 
confounding factors were not considered in 0/E (such as possible COVID-1 9  infections or 
other possible causes for CVST without thrombocytopenia). 
CVST without thrombocytopenia is an important potential risk in the V AXZEVRIA Core 
Risk Management Plan and the topic will continue to be kept under close surveillance by 
AstraZeneca.

25 August 2022 
From the data identified during the reporting period and also taking into account the 
cumulative experience, AstraZeneca considers that there is currently insufficient evidence of a 
reasonable possibility of causal relationship between Y AXZEVRIA and CYST without 
thrombocytopenia. CYST without thrombocytopenia is included in section 4.4 (section 4.4 
Warnings and Precautions) of the CDS to inform prescribers that these events may require 
different treatment approaches than TTS. Healthcare professionals should consult applicable 
guidance. No changes to the CDS or product leaflets are warranted at this time. 
AstraZeneca will continue to monitor safety information for CYST without thrombocytopenia 
as an important potential risk and take further actions as deemed appropriate. 
Immune-mediated neurological conditions 
16.3.1.2 
Immune-mediated neurological conditions is considered as an important potential risk for 
Y AXZEYRIA as per the AstraZeneca Core RMP. 
During the period covered by this PBRER, two signals ('Hypoaesthesia and Paraesthesia' and 
'Guillain-Barre syndrome' were closed. The signal of 'Hypoaesthesia and Paraesthesia' was 
closed and confirmed as a non-important identified risk and the CDS section 4.8 'Undesirable 
effects' was updated (please refer to Section 4 'Changes To Reference Safety Information' 
and Section 1 6.2.5 'Closed signals that are identified risks not categorised as important'). The 
signal ofGuillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) was closed with update of the CDS section 4.4 
'Special warnings and special precautions for use' (please refer to section 4 'Changes To 
Reference Safety Information' and section 1 6.2.2 'Closed signals categorised as important 
potential risks'). 
During the reporting interval of the PBRER, AstraZeneca had received health authority 
requests on 'Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis' which is discussed in section 1 5.2. 12 
Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis. 
Reviews of specific topics relating to Immune-mediated neurological conditions/ Nervous 
system disorders, including immune-mediated neurological conditions with Y AXZEVRIA, 
including Encephalitis, and Transverse myelitis (TM), as requested by PRAC for inclusion in 
the previous PBRER (DLP 28 December 202 1) are continued in this PBRER. 
During the period covered by this report (29 December 202 1 - 28 June 2022), a total of 5641 
cases from literature, non-interventional studies and spontaneous sources were reported within 
the concept of immune-mediated neurological disorders. Out of the 5641 cases, 1712 (30.3%) 
were medically confirmed (serious 788 (46.0%), non-serious 924 (54.0%)) and 3929 (69.7%) 
were consumer reports (serious 1 3 14 (33.4%), non-serious 2615 (66.6%)). The 5641 cases had 
6664 PTs. The most commonly reported PTs were Paraesthesia (2976), Hypoaesthesia (1982), 
Neuralgia (358), Guillain-Barre syndrome (3 1 8), Sensory disturbance (232), Neuropathy

Cumulatively till 28 June 2022, a total of 36033 cases from literature, clinical studies, non­
interventional studies and spontaneous sources were reported within the concept of immune­
mediated neurological disorders. Out of the 36033 cases, 7625 (2 1 .2%) were medically 
confirmed (3243 (42.5%) serious, 4382 (57.25%) non-serious ) and 28408 were consumer 
reports (14073 (49.5%) serious,  14335 (50.5%) non-serious. 
Literature review in the reporting period: Three relevant literature articles were identified 
(Atzenhoffer et al 2022, Keh et al 2022 and Netravathi et al 2022). Netravathi et al 2022 has 
been discussed in section 1 5.2. 12 and in the sub section below 1 6.3 . 1 .2.2. 
Atzenhoffer et al 2022 conducted a study to assess the potential association of GBS with 
mRNA-based or adenovirus-vectored COVID-1 9  vaccines, performing a comparative analysis 
using data from VigiBase, the WHO international pharmacovigilance database. Case selection 
only involved mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccines or adenovirus-vectored SARS-CoV-2 
vaccines, with exclusion criteria including (i) the time to onset between vaccination and the 
occurrence of GBS was missing, (ii) the time to onset was > 42 days after the most proximal 
dose, (iii) concomitant infections known to be associated with the occurrence of GBS were 
identified in the ICSR, and (iv) the report only mentioned "Intensive care unit weakness". 
Authors reported on 15 October 202 1 ,  3466 cases of GBS associated with COVID-1 9  vaccine 
administration extracted from VigiBase, of which 967 (27.9%) were excluded. The most 
common causes of exclusion were an unknown time to onset, and time to onset over 42 days 
from last vaccination. Of the included cases, 1299 (52%) were male, 1 1 85 (47.4%) were 
female, and 1 5  (0.6%) cases were unknown gender; 2 1 92 (87.7%) patient reported age, with a 
median of 57 (45-66) years, 652 (29.7%) were older than 64 years, and 144 (5.6%) were 
younger than 26 years. The suspected vaccines were mRNA-based COVID-1 9  vaccines in 
1 342 (53.7%) cases and adenovirus-vectored COVID-1 9  vaccines in 1 1 57 (46.3%). The 
subtype of acute polyneuropathy was GBS in 2445 (97 .8%) patients and MFS in 54 (2.2% ). 
Authors state that the results support the moderate increased risk of GBS associated with 
adenovirus-vectored COVID-1 9  vaccines found by other investigators and suggest an absence 
of safety concern for the recipients of mRNA based COVID-1 9  vaccines. 
AstraZeneca comment: 
AstraZeneca agrees with the study limitations as mentioned, that studies based on spontaneous 
reports are subject to numerous uncertainties and misclassification of the events, as well

limited clinical data available from VigiBase, where several reports were classified as 
unevaluable and case ascertainment with respect to the BCC unfeasible, occasioning an 
important percentage of excluded cases for very limited quality data. A weakness with this 
type of analysis is that it is not adjusted for any confounders. The group receiving the 
AZD1222 vaccine were the oldest, which is expected since the study period included vaccines 
administrated up to August 15, 202 1 ,  several months after many countries restricted the use of 
AZD1222 to the older population. No information on comorbidities is available, so adjustment 
for health status is not possible. 
Keh et al 2022 extracted GBS cases along with recorded diagnosis from the UK National 
Immunoglobin Database (NID) during the period 01 January 202 1 to 3 1  October 202 1 .  These 
numbers were compared to the historical GBS cases recorded in the NID from 2016 to 2020. 
GBS cases from NID (from 08 December 202 1 to 08 July 202 1) were linked to data from the 
National Immunisation Management System (NIMS) in England to identify exposure to a 
COVID-1 9  vaccine using the common NHS identifier. 
The authors also conducted a prospective surveillance study to compare the demographic and 
phenotypic characteristics of GBS cases reported from 01 January 202 1 to 
07 November 2021 ,  comparing GBS cases reported as having received COVID-1 9  
vaccination and cases without vaccination. 
The authors noted a spike of GBS cases above the 2016-2020 average occurred in March and 
April 202 1 .  Using the linked NID/NIMS data (England), 198 GBS cases occurred within 6 
weeks of the first dose of any COVID-1 9  vaccine (0.61 8  cases per 1 00,000 vaccinations in 6 
weeks, all ages). Of the 198 GBS cases, 176 followed a first dose V AXZEVRIA vaccine (rate 
0.868 per 1 00,000) and 21 followed a first dose Comimaty vaccine (rate 0. 1 83 per 1 00,000). 
Only one case was reported within 6 weeks of Spikevax (COVID-1 9  Vaccine Modema) 
vaccination. Twenty-three GBS cases were reported within 6 weeks of any second vaccine 
dose (V AXZEVRIA vaccine/messenger RNA [mRNA] vaccine). Most of the 1 76 cases with 
first dose V AXZEVRIA vaccine were reported in male vaccinees ( 106 reports [ 60%] and in 
vaccinees aged 50-59 years (50 reports [28%]; estimated 6-week GBS case rate of 
0.899/100,000) and 60-69 years (48 reports [27%]; estimated 6-week GBS case rate of 1 . 196 
/100,000). The publication reported a peak of GBS cases was observed around 24 days 
following a first dose, with higher numbers of cases seen 2-4 weeks post vaccination than in 
other periods. As per the authors, the first doses ofV AXZEVRIA vaccine accounted for the 
majority of this increase. Using case numbers from day 43-84 after first-dose vaccination as a 
comparison group (assuming this group represents a baseline random GBS rate), the authors 
concluded the excess risk in the first 42 days post-V AXZEVRIA vaccine was 0.576 GBS 
cases per 100,000 doses (95% CI 0.48 1-0.691). The absolute number of excess GBS cases 
was between 98-140 cases for first dose V AXZEVRIA vaccination from January-July 202 1 .

Secondly, the authors prospectively collected 121 UK GBS cases from the British Peripheral 
Nerve Society (BPNS) and the Association of British Neurologists (ABN) between 01 January 
and 07 November 202 1 .  The median age ofreported cases was 59 years (range 17 85), with 
59% being male. A total of 106 patients (87.3%) had received COVID-1 9  vaccination prior to 
GBS onset, with 80 ( 66. 1 % of the total dataset) having received a first dose vaccination within 
42 days of GBS onset. Based on the authors' analysis, 90% of GBS cases reported from 
January - April 2021 were within 6 weeks of vaccination, compared to only 35% of cases 
from May 2021 onwards. Vaccine manufacturer was identifiable in 102 of the 106 patients 
who received Covid-1 9  vaccine; 89 GBS reports were after V AXZEVRIA (87.3%) and 1 3  
after Comirnaty (12.7%) administration. 
Forty-two patients (34.7%) out of 121 cases of GBS were reported to have concurrent facial 
weakness. Facial weakness was bilateral in 37 of these patients. Only 7 patients (5.8%) were 
reported to have had pure bilateral facial paralysis with paraesthesia. Based on the data 
reported from a multicentre surveillance dataset, the authors concluded that no specific 
clinical features, including facial weakness, are associated with vaccination related GBS 
compared to non-vaccinated cases. 
AstraZeneca comment: 
The authors suggested that V AXZEVRIA's first dose is associated with an excess ofGBS risk 
and that no specific clinical features, including facial weakness, are associated with 
vaccination related GBS compared to non-vaccinated cases. 
AstraZeneca noted the following limitations: there was no information available on COVID-
1 9  testing in the vaccinees included in the study. The incidence rates used in the publication 
included the year 2020, where GBS incidence was less in comparison to the previous years 
(Lunn et al 2021 ), possibly due to home isolation prior to vaccine availability. Including that 
year can, therefore, provide a suppressed pre-vaccine incidence rate for comparison. The 
authors report a spike of GBS cases in March and April 2021 ,  where the main vaccine used in 
England was V AXZEVRIA, which could have contributed to more reported cases for 
V AXZEVRIA versus other vaccines. In addition, the observed clustering of cases around 
March-April 2021 coincides with a peak in the COVID-1 9  pandemic in England and increased 
viral circulation (Office for National Statistics 2022). Thus, if the spike would have been 
caused by V AXZEVRIA, the frequency of the reports would presumably have remained high 
as the vaccinations continued to be rolled out throughout 202 1 .

(excluding PT of Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis) and HLT: Encephalopathy with 
VAXZEVRIA. 
The above search identified 93  case reports ( 64 were initial case reports and 29 were 
follow-up versions), in vaccinees who received V AXZEVRIA. Cumulatively till DLP of 
28 June 2022, 343 cases pertaining to the searched term of encephalitis were received. 
Out of the 93 cases received in the reporting period, 75 cases were spontaneously reported, 
and 1 8  cases were from literature. 
Of the 93 cases, 90 (96.8%) cases were serious and 3 (3.2%) were non-serious. Fifty-eight 
(62.4%) cases were reported by healthcare professionals (medically confirmed) and 
35 (37.6%) cases were not medically confirmed. In the 93 cases, 102 events were reported. 
Out of the 93 reports, 1 9  (20.4%) were from the UK, 14 (15.1 %) India, 1 3  (14.0%) Germany,

AstraZeneca 
01 August 2022 
Based on the review, 57 out of 93 cases were classified as Brighton collaboration level 4. 
These cases did not fulfil criteria for a level 3, 2, or 1 certainty as there was insufficient 
information to confirm the diagnosis or medical assessment of the cases. 
Brighton Collaboration Level 5 
Based on the review, 2 1  out of 93 cases were classified as Brighton collaboration level 5 (ie, 
Encephalitis was excluded due to an alternative diagnosis). 
Generally, there was too limited information in many case reports to make an informed 
assessment of causality or conclude on the presence of confounding factors. 
Fatal cases 
There were 6 case reports identified with fatal outcome reported during the interval period 
(29 December 202 1 - 28 June 2022). Summaries of these case reports with details are

Summary of Fatal case reports 
AstraZeneca 
01 August 2022 
Encephalitis is a serious neurological condition, which can be fatal. Encephalitis continues to 
cause 5.6 to 39.3% of deaths in affected patients. Case fatality rate is variable and dependent 
on causative factor (Wang H et al 2022). 
Of the 6 case reports, the cause of death for l  case ( 
to encephalitis and it was reported as left parietal extensive intracerebral congestive 
haemorrhage. In the remaining cases the cause of death was encephalitis, hypoxic 
encephalopathy, encephalopathy, myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein antibody positive 
encephalomyelitis, and hypoxic ischemic encephalo  ath  in cases 
was reported as not related 
and 
respectively. 
The median age in these fatal cases was 36 years. Out of the 6 case reports, the event onset in 
2 cases were within risk window of 2-42 days, l was outside the risk window, and in the 
remaining 3 cases time to onset was unknown. One of the 6 case reports ( 
assessed as a BCC l  and causality was assessed as possibly related with confounder using 
WHO-UMC classification - this case report was from MHRA. It was reported that the patient 
experienced encephalitis on day l .  However, on further narrative review, it was stated that 
patient experienced dizziness on an unknown date after the first dose of AZ vaccine and the 
patient was hospitalized due to this. It was also reported that, 3 weeks after admission, patient 
was diagnosed with encephalitis. Therefore, TTO was conservatively presumed to be within 
the risk window and the causality assessed as 'possible with confounder' -confounder was the 
concomitant medication valproate sodium. 
was 
One ( l )  of the 6 cases was assessed as BCC3 
as 'possible with confounder' - the confounder was the concomitant medication 
levetiracetam. In this case, there was limited information about medical history, family 
history,  diagnostic work up like lumbar puncture (LP), CT, MRI, and EEG. 
and the causality was assessed 
The remaining 4 cases were assessed as BCC4 according to Brighton's collaboration criteria. 
In conclusion, the review of these 6 case reports with fatal outcome did not identify definitive 
causal association between encephalitis and V AXZEVRIA. 
Observed vs. Expected Analysis 
The observed versus expected analysis for all cases of encephalitis reported cumulatively till 
DLP 28 June 2022 is presented with different risk windows (14 days, 30 days, and 42 days) in 
Table 1 83. This includes all reported cases irrespective of the Brighton collaboration criteria 
level. The risk window of 2-42 days was included from the Brighton case definition (Law B 
2021 ). The background incidence rates used are from a meta-analysis of ACCESS rates

(Meningoencephalitis, 2010-201 3  and 2017-201 9) The outcome of observed versus expected 
analysis of all cases for encephalitis suggested that observed cases were less than expected. 
The observed versus expected analysis of cases for encephalitis showed that observed cases 
occurred significantly less frequently than expected for all age stratifications in EEA/UK, 
Brazil, and Australia. Most cases in all age groups from EEA/UK, Brazil and Australia 
showed insufficient information to make any causality assessment and only few cases met the 
Brighton Collaboration Criteria Level  1 ,  2 or 3. 
O/E analysis showed that observed cases occurred significantly less than expected. 
Conservatively, the exposure for global reports (448306152) is based on doses administered in 
1 3  markets as explained in Appendix 8.

Literature review during the reporting period 
AstraZeneca 
01 August 2022 
Eight (8) relevant articles included 12 cases of encephalitis/ encephalopathy with V AXZEVRIA were 
identified which are included in the AstraZeneca safet 
reviewed and discussed as part of safety database review. 
There were no other relevant articles identified in the reporting period concerning encephalitis and 
VAXZEVRIA. 
Summary 
Encephalitis is known to occur naturally at an overall annual incidence up to 10 cases per 1 00,000 
persons (Willame et al 2021). Incidence is highly variable dependent upon age, demographics, season, 
causative agent, and presence of epidemic illness. The natural aetiology is multifactorial but includes 
infectious, toxic, neoplastic, autoimmune, and metabolic causes (Wang H et al 2022). 
Of the 93 cases received during the reporting period, 65 (69.9%) ofvaccinees were from the age group 
of 1 8-<65 (adult) and median age was found to be 52 years; there was a slight predominant 
stratification in female gender (53.8%). In 60 (64.5%) cases, the events were reported to have 
occurred after the first dose, 1 8  (19.4%) case reports after the second dose of vaccine, 1 case was 
reported with booster dose, and dose was not reported in 12 (5.93%) case reports. 
Review of all cases during the interval period has revealed no clear pattern in clinical presentation or 
medical history. There is a wide range in time to onset (TTO) of cases from [0-240] days, with around 
half of the cases reporting a TTO with the 2--42 days risk window. The median TTO for all the cases 
was found to be 1 3  days. Forty-four (44) (47.3%) out of 93 cases were within the risk window of 
2-42 days. 90 (96.8%) of 93 cases were serious. Case fatality rate is variable and dependent on 
causative factor (Wang H et al 2022). The review of 6 case reports with fatal outcome did not identify 
any substantial evidence of a causal association between encephalitis and V AXZEVRIA. No changes 
were identified for interval data considering both safety patterns and volumes. 
Based on Brighton Collaboration criteria approach, out of the 93 cases, 1 case fulfilled level 1 criteria, 
6 fulfilled level 2 criteria, 8 fulfilled level 3 criteria, 57 fulfilled level 4 criteria, and 21 cases fulfilled 
level 5 criteria. Four (4.3%) cases were evaluated with alternative causal factors noted and the 
remaining cases were evaluated with limited information to niake any comprehensive causality 
assessment. The review of post authorization case reports did not find any evidence of a causal 
association between encephalitis and V AXZEVRIA. 
The observed versus expected analysis of cumulative cases for encephalitis showed that observed 
cases occurred significantly less frequently than expected for all cases (343) and cases with BCC 1 -3 
( 49), all age stratifications in EEA/UK, Brazil, and Australia, and risk windows. The contribution of

under-reporting cannot be estimated, but observed cases are significantly below expected and do not 
indicate a signal. 
Overall, the clinical pattern of case presentation and numbers of reports are broadly consistent with 
what might be expected from the natural epidemiology of encephalitis, and there are no specific 
biological mechanism for development of encephalitis post vaccination with V AXZEVRIA. 
Conclusion 
From the data identified during the reporting period and taking into account the cumulative 
experience, there is currently insufficient evidence of a causal association between encephalitis and 
VAXZEVRIA. 
V AXZEVRIA CDS Section 4.4 (Special warnings and special precautions for use) includes warnings 
on Neurological events: "Very rare events of demyelinating disorders, including Guillain-Barre 
syndrome (GBS), have been reported following vaccination with V AXZEVRIA". In addition, 
encephalitis (immune mediated neurological condition/ nervous system disorders, including immune­
mediated neurological conditions.) is considered as an Important potential risk in the Core and EU 
RMPs for V AXZEVRIA. No further updates to the V AXZEVRIA CDS or RMP are warranted at this 
time. As such, the topic will continue to be to be closely monitored as part of AstraZeneca's ongoing 
surveillance efforts for the important potential risk of nervous system disorders, including 
immune-mediated neurological conditions ..

Review of Cases 
Interval Period (29 December 202 1 - 28 June 2022) 
A search of the AstraZeneca safety database was conducted for the reporting period 
(29 December 2021 - 28 June 2022) using the following MedDRA (25.0) PTs: Myelitis transverse, 
Myelitis, and Acute necrotizing myelitis, and LLT: MOG-transverse myelitis. 
The search identified 1 12 case reports in vaccinees who received V AXZEVRIA. Out of the  1 12 cases: 
1 9  are literature reports; 2 are non- interventional / post-market reports; 9 1  are spontaneous reports (59 
initial and 30 follow-up and % compared to cumulative).

There were 55 (49. 1%) reports in female vaccinees, 54 (48.2%) were in male vaccinees, and the 
gender was not reported in 3 cases (2. 7% ). The age range was 20-82 years of age with a median age of 
50 years. Seventy-four (74) (66. 1 %) vaccinees were in the age group of 1 8-64 years of age, 1 7  
(15.2%) vaccinees were >65 years o f  age, and for 21 (1 8.8%) vaccinees the age was unknown. 
The adverse events (PTs) reported included Myelitis transverse (80), Myelitis (35). An individual case 
report can have more than one of' the above events reported. 
Out of the 1 12 cases, 60 (53.6%) had the time to onset (TTO) within 42 days, and in 38 cases the TTO 
was unknown. The median TTO was 15 days (range 0-333 days). Out of the 1 12 cases, 35 (3 1 .2%) 
reported the event occurring after the first dose, 22 (19.6%) after the second dose and 3 (2.7%) after a 
third/booster dose. All three cases had limited information or were confounded, and two had unknown 
TTOs. For 52 cases the dose was not specified. 
Out of the 1 12 cases, 7 (6.3%) recovered, 1 9  (17.0%) were recovering, 6 (5.4%) recovered with 
sequelae, 46 (41 . 1  %) had not recovered, and 2 (1 .8%) had a fatal outcome (the event of interest 
pertaining to TM was reported with fatal outcome only in one case). In 32 (28.6%) cases the outcome 
was unknown. 
Fatal events in the reporting period of the PBRER (29 December 2021 - 28 June 2022) 
Out of the 1 12 reports received in the interval, one case was reported with a fatal outcome and is 
summarized below:

Case ID 
concerning a 72 year-old male vaccinee received Influenza vaccine (inact sag4v) and V AXZEVRIA 
(Dose 1) about 3 weeks apart. No medical history was reported. He experienced leg weakness (with 
difficulty in walking) two weeks after V AXZEVRIA which progressed to back pain, need for 
assistance to stand out of bed and then fevers with urinary retention. Neurological examination 
suggested lower limb reduction in sensation, weakness in ankles and hips but normal upper limb. The 
patient declined admission as advised initially, however had to be admitted to the ICU and intubated 
after two days (about one month post COVID-1 9  vaccination) due to delirium, hypoxia and aspiration 
pneumonia (on CT scan). It was reported that the clinical course and imaging findings felt to be in 
keeping with atypical GBS  [acute axonal neuropathic (motor and sensory) GBS]. The event of 
Longitudinally extensive acute transverse myelitis was also reported. The patient was managed with 
anti-infective therapy, Ivig, methylprednisolone followed by plasma exchange. One failed attempt to 
extubate was reported. After an unspecified exact clinical course, it was reported that the patient 
developed side effect with Ivig (unspecified), no improvement with plasma exchange; he then

AstraZeneca comment: The patient received a Flu vaccine and AZ vaccine about 3 weeks apart and 
subsequently developed neurological features ofmyelopathy - with encephalopathy. Termed atypical 
GBS and myelitis, although the features could be solely related to TM. The pattern of neurological 
symptoms is consistent with transverse myelitis, (longitudinally extensive TM as well as plexitis are 
noted in the narrative suggesting Imaging obtained of spinal cord), with an encephalopathy of hypoxic 
ischemic origin as noted upon hospital admission. Patient refused initial recommended admission 
which was based on lower extremity weakness and sensory change and urinary retention with upper 
extremity being normal. Upon admission approx. 2 days later there was a noted aspiration pneumonia 
and cognitive changes including delirium. There was insufficient information on exclusion of other 
causes of acute delirium. Insufficient response to Ivig, methylprednisolone and plasma exchange 
suggests possible non-immune etiology. Additionally, there was insufficient information on medical 
history, CNS investigations results (CSF), radiological investigations (although longitudinally 
extensive transverse myelitis was mentioned as well as plexitis), clinical and radiological course of 
transverse myelitis, autopsy and etiological work-up (in the context of fever, hypoxia). The BCC case 
classification for transverse myelitis was considered as BCC3 due to clinical observations and fever. 
There is insufficient information on imaging, carcinoma work up (plexitis),CSF investigation and 
autopsy. TTO ofneurologic symptoms at a reasonable time-frame to both vaccinations (1 month to 
Influenza vaccine, 2 weeks to COVID-1 9  vaccine). BCC case classification for GBS was considered 
as BCC4, considering the lack of information in regard other clinical symptoms, electrophysiology 
test and CSF. The WHO-UMC causality assessed as Possible based on temporal association for TM. 
Events with Recurrence/Rechallenge in the reporting period of the PBRER 
There were no events with recurrence/rechallenge in the reporting period. 
Review of cases as per BCC classification in the reporting period of the PBRER 
The BCC (Law B 2021  [C]) was used for the review of the data available in the case reports. Based on 
this approach, out of the 1 12 cases: none of the cases fulfilled BCC Level 1 criteria; 1 3  cases fulfilled 
BCC Level 2 criteria; 1 1  cases fulfilled BCC Level 3 criteria; 66 cases fulfilled BCC Level 4 criteria; 
22 (19.65) cases fulfilled BCC Level 5 criteria. 
In addition to the BCC, the published Brighton Case Definition for Acute Myelitis (Law B 2021  [C]) 
was also referenced during the review of the cases for the assessment of evidence related to associated 
risk factors (eg, comorbidities, infections, vaccines and malignancies). 
The cases fulfil BCC levels 1-5 based on the available information on clinical course, clinical 
examination, and diagnostic investigations

Thirteen ( 1 3) out of the  1 12 case reports fulfilled BCC level 2 criteria. They are presented in Table 
1 08. 
Out of these  13 cases, 4 were reported in females and 9 were reported in males and the age range was 
27-68 years. The median age was 48 years. 
Twelve (12) of the 1 3  cases had time to onset from vaccination within 42 days. In one case the time to 
onset was unknown. The median time to onset was 1 6  days. 
Out of these 1 3  cases, 1 0  cases reported to have occurred after receiving the first dose, and the 
remaining 3 after a second dose. Out of the 1 3  cases fulfilling BCC Level 2, two as "Possible" (with 
alternate cause or confounders), nine as "Possible" (with limited information), and the remaining two 
cases as "Unlikely" as per WHO-UMC Causality assessment criteria. 
Majority of the cases (10 out of 1 3  cases) presented predominantly with bowel/bladder dysfunction in 
addition to sensory and motor involvement of extremities. This also roughly correlated with 
involvement of multiple vertebral segments, (even conus involvement). 
The CSF results presented a varied picture with respect to extent of pleocytosis (less than 100 cells/uL 
in 6 cases, more than 100 in 5 cases). Majority of cases had lymphocyte predominance (7 out of 9 
cases reporting cell count differentials) versus polymorphic picture (2 out of 9 cases reporting cell 
count differentials). 
Information on correlation of TM with IgG levels in serum and/or CSF was reported in 3 cases with 
concurrent increase in serum and CSF in 1 case 
, increase in CSF in 1 case 
, and no evidence of intrathecal IgG synthesis or normal IgG in 1 case 
). Information on oligoclonal bands in TM cases was reported in 4 cases ( 4 out of 1 3  
cases; 3 negative and 1 positive). 
Information on serum or CSF levels on anti-neuronal antibodies (eg: MOG-Ab, NMO-Ab, AQP4-Ab) 
was reported in 9 out of 1 3  cases. Out of these 9 cases, 3 cases had positive anti-neuronal antibodies

The event outcome was reported in few cases (5 out of 14 cases) with the majority reporting 
favourable outcome (n=4; recovered or recovering) and one case reported not recovered. The 
treatment administered to the patients comprised mainly pulse  steroids with oral steroid tapering and 
plasmapheresis with addition of other immunosuppressants (mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab in 3 
cases), Ivig (in 1  case), anti-virals (in 2 cases).

BCC Level 3 for Transverse Myelitis 
Nine (8.0%) out of the 1 12 case reports fulfilled BCC level 3 criteria. They are presented in 
Table  1 87. 
Out of these nine cases, three were reported in females and six were reported in males and the age 
range was 20-72 years. The median age was 55 years. Out of these 9 cases, time to onset from 
vaccination was beyond 42 days in none of the cases and missing in two case. The median time to 
onset was  14 days. 
In one of the case the event was reported to have occurred after receiving the second dose. 
Out of the nine cases fulfilling BCC Level 3, six were assessed as Possible (with limited information), 
two were Possible (with alternate cause or confounders) and the remaining case was 
Unassessable/Unclassifiable as per WHO Causality assessment criteria. 
The CSF results as available in 4 cases presented a varied picture with respect to extent of pleocytosis 
(normal count in 1 case, less than 100 cells/uL in 1 case, more than 100 in 2 cases with lymphocyte 
predominance). Information on serum or CSF levels on anti-neuronal antibodies (eg: MOG-Ab, 
NMO-Ab, AQP4-Ab) was reported in 4 out of 8 cases. Out of these 4 cases, 2 cases had positive anti­
neuronal antibodies [MOG-Ab positive in 2 cases, and remaining (2 out of 4 cases) had negative 
results. Information on oligoclonal bands in TM cases was reported in one case only (positive). To 
summarize, either there was limited information or CSF picture including neuronal antibodies had a 
varied presentation to identify any singular etiopathogenetic possible role ofV AXZEVRIA.

BCC Level 4 for Transverse Myelitis 
AstraZeneca 
25 August 2022 
A total of 68 cases fulfilled BCC Level 4 criteria, these cases did not fulfil criteria for a level 3, 
2, or 1 as there was insufficient information to confirm the diagnosis or medical assessment of 
the case. Limited information to make any causality assessment was noted in 58 of the cases, 
and alternative causal factors were noted in 1 0  of the cases. 
BCC Level 5 for Transverse Myelitis 
A case was categorised as Brighton Collaboration Level 5 for acute myelitis based on clinical 
history, examination, and laboratory investigation results to determine level of diagnostic 
certainty based on algorithm in Law B 2021  [C]. 
A total of 22 case reports fulfilled BCC level 5 criteria. Limited information to make any 
causality assessment was noted in 20 of the cases, and alternative causal factors were noted in 2 
of the cases. 
Case-level Review Summary 
None of the cases of Transverse myelitis fulfilled BCC Level  1 criteria. 
A total of 1 3  cases fulfilled BCC Level 2 criteria, and 2 of them assessed as "Possible" (with 
alternate cause or confounders), 9 as Possible (with limited information), and the remaining 2 
cases as "Unlikely" as per WHO-UMC Causality assessment criteria. Cases assessed as 
"Possible" (with limited information), were classified solely based on the TTO parameter 
(reasonable TTO considered) as there was insufficient case information (such as on vaccinees' 
medical history, comorbidities, concomitant medications, etiological work-up, etc.) to rule out 
alternative explanations. 
A total of9 cases of transverse myelitis fulfilled BCC Level 3 criteria. Out of these 9 cases 2 
cases were "Possible" (with alternate cause or confounders), 6 were "Possible" (with limited 
information), and the remaining case was "Unassessable/Unclassifiable" as per WHO Causality 
assessment criteria. Cases were assessed as "Possible" based solely on the TTO, however there 
was insufficient case information (such as on vaccinees' medical history, comorbidities, 
concomitant medications, etiological work-up etc.) for further evaluation. 
A total of 68 cases fulfilled BCC Level 4 criteria and 22 cases fulfilled BCC Level 5 criteria.

Of the remaining cases, the event could also be explained by the vaccinees' diseases or other 
medications (Sarcoidosis, Devic's disease (Neuromyelitis Optica), Multiple sclerosis 
(necessitating treatment with fingolimod, CSF cell counts suggesting CSF infections, 
thrombosis milieu, pre-existing spinal stenosis suggesting pre-existing spinal pathologies, pre­
existing immune and neuromuscular inflammatory milieu ( as suggested by fibromyalgia, 
arthritis). 
Cumulative Period (29 December 2020 - 28 June 2022) 
A cumulative search of the AstraZeneca global patient safety was conducted through 28 June 
2022 using the same search strategy described above. The search identified 354 case reports 
(with PTs Myelitis and Myelitis transverse) in vaccinees who received V AXZEVRIA. 
Out of the 354 cases: 320 (90.4%) of the cases were serious and 142 (40. 1 %) were medically 
confirmed. Out of the 354 cases, 24 (6.8%) recovered, 69 (19.5%) were recovering,  10 (2.8%) 
recovered with sequelae, 1 92 (54.2%) had not recovered and 2 (0.5%) had a fatal outcome. In 
56 (15.8%) cases the outcome was unknown. 
There were 1 92 (54.2%) reports in female vaccinees, 153 (43.2%) were in male. 
vaccinees, and the gender was not reported in 9 cases (2.5%). The age range was 16-88 years 
of age with a median age of 5 1  years. A total of236 (66.7%) vaccinees were in the age group 
of 1 8-64 years of age, 60 (16.9%) vaccinees were >65 years of age, 1 (0.3%) vaccinee was 
< 1 8  years of age, and for 57 (16.1%) vaccinees the age was unknown. 
Out of the 354 cases, 206 had the time to onset (TTO) within 42 days, and in 1 12 cases the 
TTO was unknown. The median TTO was  12 days (range 0-333 days). One additional case 
from regulatory authority reported TTO as 3 87 days which may be considered as incorrect. 
Out of the 354 cases, 164 (46.3%) reported the event occurring after the first dose, 49 (13.8%) 
after the second dose, and 3 (0.8%) after a third/booster dose. In 138 (40.0%) cases the dose 
was not specified. 
Observed Versus Expected Analysis (cumulative) 
Please refer to Appendix 8 for the methodology of the O/E analyses and Appendix 9 for any 
additional sensitivity analysis. 
The observed versus expected analysis was carried out for cases of transverse myelitis with 
V AXZEVRIA received cumulatively through 28 June 2022. There were 354 cases identified, 
out of which a total of207 cases had the time to onset (TTO) within 42 days and in 1 1 1  cases, 
the TTO was unknown.

Willame et al 2021  [BJ have as part of ADVANCE EUROPE given incidence rates for 
transverse myelitis, stratified by age. The rates are slightly lower than other rates found 
corresponding to a more conservative estimate for background rates. An appendix to the same 
article by Willame et al 2021  [BJ  has given incidence rates stratified by age and gender. 
Global overall rates based on the rates from ADVANCED Europe are presented in Table 1 88 
The observed numbers are presented both including and excluding cases with an unknown 
time to onset and stratified by cases fulfilling Brighton collaboration criteria levels 1 -3 (BCC 
1 -3). 
The risk window for myelitis as a product related reaction for inactivated or subunit vaccines 
is likely similar to ADEM, where the recommended risk window for individuals is 2-42 days 
(Law B 2021  [B]. A risk window of 42 days was used for this analysis, ie, cases that have the 
time to onset of 42 days or less from receiving the vaccine until the event occurred are 
counted in the observed numbers. 
Conservatively, the exposure for global reports (4483061 52) is based on doses administered in 
1 3  markets as explained in Appendix 8.

Observed vs expected analysis summary: 
When the observed versus expected analysis is carried out overall for global reports for all 
ages and genders, the number of observed cases is significantly less than expected for all 
stratifications provided. 
When stratified by age only in the UK using the ADVANCE EUROPE rates, observed cases 
are significantly more than expected for age groups 25-44 years regardless of whether cases 
with an unknown time to onset are included or not. For the age group 1 5-24 years, observed 
cases are more than expected, however the disproportionality was not significant when cases 
with unknown TTO are not included. For the age group 45-64 years observed cases are less 
than expected when cases with an unknown TTO are not included. For the older age group 
(65+) observed cases are more than expected when cases with an unknown TTO are not 
included. When the cases with an unknown TTO are included for all age groups, observed 
cases are more than expected with a significant disproportionality. 
When only cases of transverse myelitis fulfilling BCC levels 1 -3 are included, observed cases 
are significantly less than/less than expected for all stratifications.

The observed cases for females in the UK using the rate from UK.THIN are more than 
expected. When stratified by age and gender, observed cases for females were greater than 
expected in all the age groups except for 45-64 years, without the result being significant. In 
the 45-64 years group, observed cases were significantly less than expected. Observed cases 
were significantly more than expected for females overall when rate from UK.THIN and when 
cases with unknown TTO were included. For other stratifications, observed cases were either 
more or less than expected without the result being significant, the only exception being the 
25-44 years group, where the observed was significantly more than expected. 
When only cases fulfilling BCC levels 1-3 are included, observed cases are either less or 
significantly less than expected for all age stratifications (result is not significant for the 
youngest age group,  1 5-24 years, however, there are no observed cases with BCC 1 -3 in that 
age group). 
When stratified by age and gender, the observed cases for males are significantly more than 
expected for males overall when cases with an unknown TTO are included. For all age 
stratifications in males, the numbers are low, leading to the finding that the results for each 
age group are not significant. When the UK.THIN rates are used, the youngest age group (15-
24 years) and the oldest age group ( 65+ years) have observed cases more than expected. When 
cases with unknown TTO were included, however, all age groups had observed higher than 
expected. 
When males are stratified by BCC levels 1 -3, observed cases were less/significantly less than 
expected in all age groups, regardless of whether unknown TTO was included. 
Cases were also stratified by dose. For Dose 1 Overall, the observed cases were significantly 
less than expected. When Dose 1  cases in males were stratified using UK THIN background 
rates, the cases were either more or less than expected in all age stratifications. Overall the 
observed number of cases was significantly more than expected (26 cases to  15.34). Cases 
fulfilling BCC 1 -3 criteria showed observed cases were significantly less than expected in 
males overall and the 25-44 years age group. For the other age groups observed cases were 
less than expected. 
Cases in female patients after dose 1 stratified using the same UK THIN background rates did 
not have any significant findings except the BCC  1-3 cases where the observed cases were 
significantly less than expected (in females overall and ages 45-64 years age group). 
When stratified by age only in the UK using the ADVANCE EUROPE rates, the observed 
cases were more than all age groups except the 25-44 years range where it was significantly 
more than expected for the first dose (18 observed, 7.32 expected). When stratified by cases 
fulfilling BCC 1 -3, observed cases were significantly less than/less than expected.

For Dose 2, overall, the observed cases were significantly less than expected with and without 
unknown TTO cases and BCC  1-3. With the UK THIN background rates, observed cases were 
overall significantly less than expected in males and females after dose 2. This was also 
significantly less than observed for cases stratified by dose, age and BCC in the UK using 
ADVANCE EUROPE rates. 
Review of Literature for the reporting period 
The literature article by Netravathi et al 2022 presenting an observational comparative 
analysis study, case series ( over a period from May 202 1 to December 202 1) of patients with 
different neurological manifestations of CNS demyelination presenting within 6 weeks of 
vaccination against SARS-CoV-2, was identified in the reporting period of this PBRER and 
its assessment did not find any safety finding with impact on benefit-risk profile of 
V AXZEVRIA. Please refer to section 1 5  .2. 12 'Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis' for 
the full literature review and assessment. 
Overall Summary 
The pathogenesis for TM is thought to be immune-mediated from infection, para-infectious 
processes, autoimmune disease, or paraneoplastic processes. The exact mechanism of TM 
following immunization is unknown. 
There were 21 cases of TM (fulfilling at least BCC 3 criteria) received during the reporting 
period, of these, 1 8  were assessed to be classified as "Possible" according to WHO-UMC 
causality criteria ( as either "Possible" with limited information/ "Possible" with confounders 
or alternate cause). Fourteen (14) of the 1 8  cases were classified as "Possible" with Limited 
Information based solely on the TTO parameter (reasonable TTO considered) as there was 
insufficient case information (such as vaccinees' medical history, comorbidities, concomitant 
medications, etiological work-up etc). For the remaining four cases the event could also be 
explained by the vaccinees' diseases or other medications. 
In addition, an observed versus expected analysis of cumulative cases meeting Brighton 
collaboration criteria levels 1 -3 showed that the observed number of TM cases fulfilling case 
definition are either less than or significantly less than the number of expected cases in all risk 
windows. 
Conclusion 
From the data identified during the reporting period and taking into account the cumulative 
experience, there is currently insufficient evidence of a causal association between Transverse 
Myelitis and V AXZEVRIA. As per Section 4.4 (Special warnings and special precautions for 
use) in the VAXZEVRIA CDS as below: Very rare events of demyelinating disorders have 
CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY

been reported following vaccination with COVID-1 9"-Vaccine AstraZeneca. A causal 
relationship has not been established._As with other vaccines, the benefits and potential risks 
of vaccinating individuals with V AXZEVRIA should be considered. 
In conclusion, it is AstraZeneca's opinion that no changes to the V AXZEVRIA CDS, and 
RMP, are warranted based on the review of currently available information. 
Surveillance of Transverse Myelitis will continue to be closely monitored as part of 
AstraZeneca's ongoing surveillance efforts for the important potential risk of Nervous system 
disorders, including immune-mediated neurological conditions. 
Overall Conclusion for Immune Mediated Neurological Conditions: 
During the period covered by this PBRER, the CDS section 4.8 'Undesirable effects' was 
updated with addition of paraesthesia and hypoaesthesia to the summary of post-authorisation 
data, with frequency "uncommon" and the CDS section 4.4 'Special warnings and special 
precautions for use' on Neurological events was updated to specifically reference very rare 
events of Guillain-Barre Syndrome, please refer to Section 4 and 1 6.2.2. 
It is AstraZeneca's opinion that no further changes to the V AXZEVRIA CDS, RMPs, 
corresponding local labels or product leaflets are warranted based on the review of currently 
available information. Immune-mediated neurological conditions will continue to be closely 
monitored as part of AstraZeneca's ongoing surveillance efforts for the important potential 
risk of immune-mediated neurological conditions.

trials (2, 0.4%). Of these 5 1 9  cases, 321 cases (299 serious and 22 non-serious) were 
medically confirmed with the use ofV AXZEVRIA. There were 210 (40.5%) case reports 
from elderly vaccinees, 274 (52.8%) from adult vaccinees, and age was unknown in 35 (6.7%) 
vaccinees. The outcome of potential V AEON AERO events was fatal in  136 of the total 5 1 9  
(26.2%) cases reported during the interval period. 
Cumulative data through 28 June 2022 
There have been 2139 case reports of potential VAEDN AERO which included 2238 events.

25 August 2022 
A search of the Embase and InsightMeme.com databases was undertaken covering the interval 
period to identify literature on V AEON AERO with COVID-1 9  vaccines, including 
VAXZEVRIA. 
A total of75 (64 from Embase and 1 1  from InsightMeme) search results were obtained. Of 
these, none identified any new safety information or discussions of the mechanism of action 
relevant to the review of this topic. 
Summary 
On review of 5 1 9  cases of V AEON AERO received during the reporting period, a majority 
(459 out of 5 19, 88.4%) of them were reported as serious, of which 299 cases were medically 
confirmed, and 136 out of 5 1 9  (26.2%) cases reported fatal outcomes. These cases had 
insufficient information on dose latency, medical history, concomitant medications, baseline 
medical condition prior to vaccination, clinical course, diagnostic and etiologic workup, and 
storage and transport conditions of the vaccine, which precluded a proper causal assessment. 
No hypothesized mechanism/pathways have been identified to date. No new safety 
information on this topic was identified through the review of the literature. 
Conclusion 
Based on evaluation of the available data during this reporting period and considering the 
cumulative experience, there is insufficient evidence of a reasonable possibility of a causal 
association between V AEON AERO and V AXZEVRIA. 
In conclusion, it is AstraZeneca's opinion that no changes to the V AXZEVRIA CDS or RMP 
are warranted based on the review of currently available information. 
Since the concept of VAEDN AERO is an Important Potential Risk and an AESI with 
V AXZEVRIA, AstraZeneca recognizes the need for surveillance and will continue to closely 
monitor the reported events of VAEDN AERO. 
More detailed information regarding this important potential risk is provided in 
Section 1 6.4.2.

Review of Cases 
A cumulative search of the AstraZeneca safety database was undertaken for AE reports under 
the HLT: Thrombocytopenia and SMQ: Hematopoietic Thrombocytopenia Narrow co­
reported with events identified from the SMQ: Embolic and thrombotic events with 
V AXZEVRIA. This search criteria were also applied to retrieve case reports of Thrombosis 
with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) following both first and second dose of 
V AXZEVRIA. Also, cases with a reported PT of Thrombosis with Thrombocytopenia 
Syndrome (TTS) or Vaccine-Induced Prothrombotic Immune Thrombocytopenia (VIPIT) or 
Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia (VITT) were included, as there is 
now corresponding PTs in Med.ORA version 25.0. Also, cases of CVST from Section 1 6.3.2. 1 
with platelet count less than 1 50 x  1 09/ L were included. This covered the period up to 
28 June 2022 
The search resulted in a total of2392 individual cases (cumulative up to 28 June 2022), and 
one case was considered as potential duplicate on further review. The below analysis was 
focused on 2391 unique reports. Of the 2391 cases, 2380 (99.5%) were serious and 1 1  were 
non serious, 1715 case reports were medically confirmed and 676 were consumer reports and 
1 7 1 5  case reports were from regulatory, 371 from spontaneous, 304 from literature sources, 
and 1 from Post-marketing/non-interventional study. There were 260 cases reported with 
thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia after Dose 2. There were 8 cases occurred 
after administration of a Dose 3/booster ( either of V AXZEVRIA or an mRNA vaccine): 6 
after a V AXZEVRIA booster, and 2 after an mRNA booster. The 2 cases after an mRNA 
booster are not further discussed here as they do not concern the use of V AXZEVRIA as a 
booster. 
During the reporting interval (29 December 2021 to 28 June 2022), there were 447 cases (19% 
of the total cumulative cases) reported. Of the 447 case reports there were 255 initial reports 
(23 1 concerning Dose 1 ,  17 concerning Dose 2, and 7 cases concerning Dose 3). There were 
1 92 follow-up reports [ 1 82 concerning Dose 1 and 10 concerning Dose 2]). Further analysis in 
this report is focused on the cumulative report. 
Of these 2391  case reports, 1257 (53%) reports were reported in females, 1 068 (45%) reports 
in males, and in 67 (3%) cases the gender was not reported.

Reporting rate for thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia across all age groups 
based on the data from both UK and EEA by risk window of 2 1  days and 42 days is provided 
in Table 196 and Table 1 97, respectively. Reporting rate is also stratified by Dose 1 and 
Dose 2. 
The overall TTS reporting rate from the UK was 10.87/million (532 identified reports with 
time to onset ::; 2 1  days; estimated exposure 48.93 million administered doses) when 
compared to 5.6 (event rates per l M  Person Years (PY) per 21 days Truven Market Scan-
2019, aligned with the Observational Health Data Science and Informatics (OHDSI) TTS 
algorithm) and 1 0.7 (event rates per l M  PY per 2 1days Truven Market Scan-201 9). 
The reporting rate for the cases where the MHRA case classification criteria was met 
(confirmed, probable, and possible) was 13.94/million administered doses. 
The following reporting rate pertains to the risk window of 2 1  days, For UK, the reporting rate 
for Dose 1 and Dose 2 was 1 8.32 and 3.19/million doses administered doses respectively. For 
all administered doses and Dose 1 ,  the reporting rate in the 1 8  to 39 and 40 to 49 age groups 
was higher when compared to background rate. For all administered doses the reporting rate in 
50 to 64 age group was within the background rate. For Dose 1 ,  the reporting rate in the 50 to 
64 age group was higher than the background rate. For all administered doses the reporting 
rate in the 65+ age group was less compared to the background rate. Reporting rate for Dose 2 
was less when compared to the background rate for overall and all age stratifications. 
The following reporting rate pertains to the risk window of 42 days, For UK, the reporting rate 
for Dose 1 and Dose 2 was 21 .72 and 3.98/million doses administered doses respectively. For 
all administered doses and Dose 1 ,  the reporting rate in the 1 8  to 39 and 40 to 49 age groups 
was higher when compared to background rate. 
The overall TTS reporting rate from the EEA was 12.43 /million (598 identified reports with 
time to onset ::; 2 1  days; estimated exposure 48. 1 1  million administered doses) when 
compared to 5.6 (event rates per l M  PY per 2 1  days Truven Market Scan-2019, aligned with 
the OHDSI TTS algorithm) and 1 0.7 (event rates per l M  PY per 2 1days Truven Market Scan-
201 9). The reporting rate for the cases where the MHRA case classification criteria was met 
(confirmed, probable and possible) was 6.59/million administered doses. Reporting rate for 
Dose 1 and Dose 2 was 12.25 and 0.35/million doses administered doses. 
EEA Reporting rate in the 1 8  to 49 age group and the 50 to 59 years age group with all doses

Observed versus Expected Analysis 
Please refer to Appendix  8 for the methodology of the O/E analyses and Appendix 9  for any 
additional sensitivity analysis. 
Observed versus expected analyses for TTS (including CYST) and CYST with 
thrombocytopenia are presented in Appendix  1 8  tables 2, 3, 4 and 10. Background rates for 
TTS were derived from MarketScan (US claims) data, using OHDSI-aligned code lists and 
definitions for TTS. Algorithm 1 for TTS uses OHDSI-aligned TTS (TCP within -7/+7 days 
of thrombosis) whereas algorithm 2 for TTS uses OHDSI-aligned TTS (TCP within -1/+14 
days of thrombosis), please also refer to further clarification in Section 1 5.2. 10, response to 
Question 5. 
The background rate (incidence rate) of TTS is 9.77/100,000 person years and 
1 1 . 14/100,000 person years. The observed number of cases, for all risk windows of 14, 2 1 ,  
and 42 days (with unknown time to onset not included) is less than expected post vaccination 
by Y AXZEYRIA. 
The observed number of cases for risk windows of 14 days ( with unknown time to onset 
included) post vaccination by Y AXZEYRIA of TTS is greater than the expected with 
background rate 9.77/100,000 person years and lesser than the expected with background rate 
with l 1 . 14/100,000 person years. 
The observed number of cases for risk window of 2 1  days (with unknown time to onset 
included) post vaccination by Y AXZEYRIA of TTS is less than the expected with both 
background rate 9.77/100,000 person years and background rate with l 1 . 14/100,000 person 
years. 
The observed number of cases for risk windows of 42 days (with unknown time to onset 
included) post vaccination by Y AXZEYRIA of TTS is less than expected with both 
background rates. 
For the EU, UK, Brazil, and Australia, the observed number of cases for ages 1 8  to 49 years, 
post vaccination by Y AXZEVRIA of TTS are observed more than expected, for risk windows 
of 14 days, 2 1  days, and 42 days with the background rates and during the washout period the 
observed number of cases for ages 1 8  to 49 years are observed more than expected for the risk 
window of 14 days and 2 1  and less than expected for the risk window 42 days with the 
background rate. 
The incidence Rate from Truven Market Scan (201 9) aligned with the OHDSI TTS algorithm 
for the EU, the observed number of cases for female and male are significantly more than 
expected, for risk windows of 14 days, 2 1  days whereas observed number of cases for female

significantly more than expected and for observed number of cases male significantly less 
than expected in 42 days post vaccination by V AXZEVRIA of TTS with all background rates. 
For the UK, in the risk window for 14 days and 2 1  days, post vaccination by V AXZEVRIA of 
TTS the observed number of cases for females age  18 to 49, 50 to 59, and 60 to 69 years are 
more than expected, whereas in age groups 70 to 79 and over 80 years are observed less than 
expected. Also, for risk window of 42 days post vaccination by V AXZEVRIA of TTS for 
females age 1 8  to 49, 50 to 59 years are more than expected, whereas age groups 60 to 69, 70 
to 79 and over 80 years are observed less than expected. 
For the EU, the observed number of cases for male ages 1 8  to 49 and 50 to 59 years are more 
than expected, whereas age group 60 to 69, 70 to 79, and over 80 years are observed less than 
expected, for risk window of 14 days, 2 1  days, and 42 days post vaccination by V AXZEVRIA 
ofTTS with all background rates. (Observed versus Expected Analysis for TTS provided 
Appendix-1 8, Table 2, Table 3 and Table 4). 
MHRA Case Definition 
Anti-PF-4, D-Dimer, and platelet levels for Dose  1, Dose 2 and Fatal Reports 
All 2391 case reports were reviewed to classify the cases based on the PTs and laboratory 
data, as per the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) case 
definition for thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia (see Section 1 5.2. 1 5, Figure 
3. 
Information in case reports was limited, with missing laboratory data on platelet count, 
D-dimer level, and PF-4 antibodies and also in many case reports there were incomplete 
entries (units, date of test, and type of test) for platelet levels, D-dimer, and PF-4. 
Information on platelet count was available in 1 642 (69%) of 239 1 case reports; platelet count 
was < 150 x 1 09/L in 1578 of the 1642 reports and in 64 case reports platelet count was 
> 1 50 x 1 09/L. Among these 1 578 vaccinees with reported platelet count < 1 50 x 1 09/L, 
662 ( 41 % ) had a platelet count of < 50 x 109 /L; 412 (26%) had a platelet count between 50 to 
< 1 00 x 1 09/L; and 480 (30%) had a platelet count between 100 to 150 x 1 09/L.79, the platelet 
count was reported as < 1 50 x 1 09/L, For the reaming 24 cases with platelet count less than 
1 50, the value of platelet was unknown. 
In the remaining 7 49 (3 1 % ) of the 2391 case reports, information on platelet, count was not 
available. In 386 of the 2391 case reports there was no venous/arterial thrombosis reported. Of 
the 2391 case reports, PF-4 antibodies were positive in 601 (25%) reports, negative in 
495 (20%) reports, unknown or pending in 1295 (54%) case reports. D-dimer levels were 
reported in 974 (41 %) of the 2391 case reports, however, in many reports the units were not

D-dimer levels were > 4000 ng/mL. In  147 1 (59%) case reports, D-dimer levels were not 
provided/reported. 
Of the 2391 case reports reviewed, based on the above case classification criteria, there were 
1 561 (65%) cases which met the MHRA criteria of TTS (Confirmed, probable, or possible). 
The total number of confirmed cases was 342 (14%), probable cases - 381 (16%), possible 
cases - 838 (35%), unlikely - 1 (0.2%), and criteria were not met for 829 (34%) cases. Out of 
all cases (1561) which met the criteria, the confirmed cases (342) comprised 2 1  % of the total 
cases. 
In cases (1561) where the MHRA case classification criteria were met, 546 (35%) cases had 
confounding factors. Many of the cases had more than one confounding factor. The 
confounding factors were reported as follows: 
• 
autoimmune disease (ITP, autoimmune thyroiditis, psoriasis, antiphospholipid syndrome 
(APLS), Crohn's disease, myasthenia gravis, inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative 
colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, rheumatoid arthritis, guillain-barre syndrome, sarcoidosis, 
systemic lupus erythematous (SLE), autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), vasculitis, multiple 
sclerosis, hemolytic anaemia, polymyalgia rheumatica, thalassemia minor and connective 
tissue disorder); 
•  malignancies (breast cancer, prostate cancer, malignant melanoma, brain cancer, thyroid

Out of 342 confirmed reports, there were 148 (43%) cases with confounding factors. The 
confounding factor associated were past history of heparin, malignancies (neoplasm, 
abdominal neoplasm, thyroid cancer, prostate cancer, vulvar cancer, metastatic cancer, skin 
cancer, pancreatic cancer, carcinoma endometrium uterus, non-Hodgkin's disease, breast 
cancer, malignant melanoma), obesity, contraceptives, ITP, autoimmune disease (sarcoidosis,

history of thrombosis, chronic kidney disease. The dates of heparin administration were not 
reported in all cases. 
Demographics (age, gender, and country) and clinical characteristics of thrombosis in 
combination ofthrombocytopenia is provided in Table 198 and Table 1 99. Comparison of 
Platelet count, thrombosis event, PF-4 antibodies and D-dimer levels is provided in Appendix 
1 8, Table 5, and Table 6. 
TTS case reports by age/gender, Dose, Case Classification, and fatality are presented in 
Table 1 99. 
Based on the MHRA case classification criteria, 65% (1 561/2391) were categorised as 
confirmed/probable/possible (2 1 % of the cases met confirmed criteria, 24% met probable 
criteria, 54% met possible criteria). The remaining 53% cases did not meet criteria and < 1 % 
of the cases were classified as unlikely. There was no difference in the case categorisation 
criteria between Dose  1 ,  Dose 2, and fatal case reports. For the cases that occurred after Dose 
2, 7 1  % were categorised as confirmed/probable/possible (5% of the cases met confirmed 
criteria,  1 8% met probable criteria, 47% met possible criteria) and 28% were categorised as 
criteria not met.

TTO was available in 307/414 (74%) of the 414 fatal reports and ranged from O to 121 days 
with a median TTO of 1 1  days. Of the 414 fatal events, 388 fatal reports occurred after 
Dose 1 ,  26 fatal case reports occurred after Dose 2 and there were 0 1 fatal cases after Dose 3. 
TTO was available in 23 reports after Dose 2 with a range of O to 88 days and a median of 
13 days. 
The most frequently reported events of thrombosis in the fatal reports were: Cerebral venous 
sinus thrombosis (1 17), followed by (> 10) Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome 
(88), Pulmonary embolism (78), Thrombosis (65), Cerebral venous thrombosis (43), Portal 
vein thrombosis (34), Hemiparesis (33), Cerebral thrombosis (28), Disseminated intravascular 
coagulation (25), Cerebrovascular accident (25), Cerebral infarction (19), Deep vein 
thrombosis (1 8), Superior sagittal sinus thrombosis (17), Transverse sinus thrombosis (13), 
Ischaemic stroke (12), Peripheral artery thrombosis (1 1 ), Mesenteric vein thrombosis (1 1 ), 
Hemiplegia (1 1), Acute myocardial infarction (1 1). 
The highest number of the fatal cases were due to HL T: Cerebrovascular and venous sinus 
thrombosis (173/414, 42%) and the Cerebral haemorrhage was the most common bleeding 
event associated with fatal event (1 12/414, 27%). In the previous PBRER (DLP 
29 December 202 1) he highest number of the fatal cases were due to HL T: Cerebrovascular

and venous sinus thrombosis and with similar percentage (1 50/349, 43%) and the Cerebral 
haemorrhage was also the most common bleeding event associated with fatal event. 
For fatal cases, a total of 264/414 (64%) case reports reported venous sites of thrombosis, 
262/414 (63%) case reported, PT from all 3 arterial, venous and vessel type and mixed arterial 
and in 81/414 (19%) case reported arterial site of thrombosis. 
In 250 out of 414 fatal reports (64%), there was a co-reported bleeding event from the narrow 
SMQ: Haemorrhage terms (excl. laboratory terms). Most common (> 10) bleeding events 
included Cerebral haemorrhage (1 12), Haemorrhage intracranial (36), Subarachnoid 
haemorrhage (3 1 ), Disseminated intra vascular coagulation (25), Haemorrhage ( 15), Contusion 
(12), Petechiae 1 1 . Forty-seven (47) case reports had the co-reported events from the 
HL T: Coagulopathies, including 58 cases with DIC. 
Fatality/survival rate over time 
Fatality/survival rate over time was calculated based on the case onset date. The onset date 
was not reported in 564 of the 2391 case reports, and for 1 1 9 case reports with fatal outcome. 
In cases where the onset date was not reported, date initially received by AstraZeneca was 
used to calculate the reporting fatality/survival rate over time. Fatality/survival rate 
cumulatively for each month up to 28 June 2022 is presented in Table 201 and Figure 9.

January 202 1 -March 202 1 .  There is an increased fatality rate in December 202 1 (7 reported 
fatal events out of 25 reports) compared to the earlier months. However, vaccination in these 
4 fatal cases occurred prior to December 2021 ,  but were reported in December 202 1 with 
unknown event onset dates, which could explain the reason for the increased fatality rate. Two

and/or time to onset was not reported in either of these cases. The 3rd case

dates, event onset dates, or time to event onset reported. The 4th case 
originated from Brazil contained limited information with no reported vaccination dates, event

time to onset was not reported in either of these cases. 
and 
Number and percent of fatal reports since April 2021 has decreased compared to 
January-March 2021 which suggests the effectiveness of the diagnostic and treatment 
guidelines implemented (ASH 202 1 ,  EHP 2021and Thaler et al 2021) in March 202 1 .

Fatality rate over time by age group/gender for all cases is presented in Appendix 1 8  Table 7 
and fatality rate over time by age group/gender and doses (separately for all doses, Dose  1 ,  
and Dose 2 )  for confirmed/probable/possible cases is presented in Table 202. 
Fatality rate in female vaccinees is higher (60%) compared to male (37%) for all cases and 
fatality rate in confirmed/probable/possible cases, is higher in female compared to male for all 
doses (60% vs 37%) and Dose 1  (60% vs 36%) but for Dose 2, fatality rate in female is less 
than male ( 46% vs 54% ); the reason for this difference might be cases received with Dose 2 
are very little and this would increase the percentage markedly. 
For all cases, highest fatality rate in female vaccinees was 73% in 40 to 49 years and 61 % in 
50 to 59 years age group, whereas in male vaccinees the highest fatality rate was 48% in 60 to 
69 years and 37% in 50 to 59 years age group. In confirmed/probable/possible cases, highest 
fatality rate in female vaccinees was 61 % in 50 to 59 years, 78% in 40 to 49 years, 56% in 60 
to 69 years age groups ( all doses) and 64% in 50 to 59 years, 78% in 40 to 49 years, 56% in 
60 to 69 years age groups (Dose 1) and 33% in 70 to 79 years age group (Dose 2), while in 
male vaccinees highest fatality rate in male vaccinees was 44% in 60 to 69 years and 36% in 
50 to 59 years (all doses) and 44% in 60 to 69 years 33% in 50 to 59 years in age group (Dose 
1) and 66% in 70 to 79 years age group (Dose 2). Fatality rate for some age 
groups/gender/months is increased compared to the previous period; however, reports 
received for these age groups/gender/months did not have onset dates of events and case 
received date was considered for analysis. This may be the reason for increased fatality rate,

TTS reports after Dose 2 of V AXZEVRIA 
AstraZeneca 
25 August 2022 
A search of the AstraZeneca global safety database was undertaken to retrieve adverse event 
reports of thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia reported following 
administration of the Dose 2 of the V AXZEVRIA. The search encompassed all cases retrieved 
up to 28 June 2022. The search criteria mentioned above was used to identify TTS cases post 
Dose 2. The cases of TTS following the Dose 2 were confirmed based on the dose 
number/information provided in the narrative, if the reports did not contain information on 
Dose 2, they were not included in the below analysis. The search identified 260 cumulative 
cases of TTS following the second dose ofV AXZEVRIA. Time to onset was available in 
260 of the 232 cases and ranged from O to 226 days with a median TTO of 14 days after 2nd 
dose. Time to onset by 14 days, 2 1  days, and 42 days is presented in Table 195. 
The majority of the 260 case reports of TTS following second dose occurred in male 
vaccinees ( 1 54, 59%). Of the 260 case reports of TTS following second dose, 104 were 
female (40%), and gender was unknown in 2 report. The age range ofvaccinees was from 
22 to 95 years, age was not provided in 20 of the 260 reports. Median age was 65.5 years and 
38 (14%) of the reports were in vaccinees > 50 years. Outcome in 88 cases were reported as 
Not recovered, 20 Recovered, 75 Recovering, 26 Fatal, 1 0  Recovered with sequalae and 
Unknown in 41 report. 
These events included the following sites of thrombosis (� 5): Pulmonary embolism (122), 
Deep vein thrombosis (70), Thrombosis (37), Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome 
(19), Cerebrovascular accident (16), Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (13), Embolism (10), 
Portal vein thrombosis (9), Superior sagittal sinus thrombosis (5), Peripheral artery thrombosis 
(5), Mesenteric vein thrombosis (5). 
In 57 out of 260 reports (23%) with Dose 2, there was a co-reported bleeding event from the 
narrow SMQ: Haemorrhage terms (excl laboratory terms). The reported events (� 2) included: 
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (4), Haemorrhagic adrenal infarction (2), 
Haemorrhagic stroke (2). There were two case report with the co-reported events from the 
HLT: Coagulopathies following Dose 2 with the event Coagulopathy (1) and 
Antiphospholipid syndrome (1 ). 
Using the estimated exposure of 104713978 administered 2nd vaccinations with 
V AXZEVRIA in UK, EEU, Canada, Iran, Korea, Republic of, Taiwan, Japan and Thailand 
the reporting rate of thrombotic events in combination with thrombocytopenia (with time to 
onset ::; 21 days;  1 52 reports) following the second V AXZEVRIA was estimated to be 
1 .45 per million doses. Most of the vaccines who experienced TTS post Dose 2 were male 
(59%) and were older in age with a median age of 65 years. The rate ofTTS following 2nd of 
V AXZEVRIA is less compared to the background rate for all age groups ( see Table 196 and 
Table 1 97) of 5.62 (event rates per lM PY per 21 days Truven Market Scan-2019, aligned

with the OHDSI TTS algorithm) and 10.75 (event rates per l M  PY per 2 1  days Truven 
Market Scan-2019, aligned with the OHDSI TTS algorithm [with updated OHDSI aligned 
codelists and washout periods]). 
This rate of thrombotic events in combination with thrombocytopenia following 1 st dose of 
V AXZEVRIA is below the estimated reporting rate of 12.58 per million doses for first dose of 
V AXZEVRIA ( 1 3 1 9  identified reports with time to onset ::; 2 1  days; estimated exposure 
1 04768282 administered doses). TTS events following the second dose had a different 
demographic pattern as well, being older and more likely male compared to dose 1 .  
Summary and conclusion for TTS is presented below after discussion of CVST + 
thrombocytopenia. 
Reporting rate for Dose 1 and Dose 2 was 27. 1 8  and 5 . 14/million doses administered doses 
respectively. For all administered doses and Dose 1 ,  The observed number of cases are 
significantly more than expected, for risk windows of 14 days (with unknown time to onset 
included) post vaccination by V AXZEVRIA of TTS with both background rates. 
TTS reports after Dose 3 of V AXZEVRIA 
A search of the AstraZeneca global safety database was undertaken to retrieve adverse event 
reports of thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia reported following 
administration of the Dose 3 of the V AXZEVRIA. The search encompassed all cases retrieved 
up to 28 June 2022. The search criteria mentioned above was used to identify TTS cases post 
Dose 3. The cases of TTS following the Dose 3 were confirmed based on the dose 
number/information provided in the narrative. There were 8 cases occurred after 
administration of a Dose 3/booster (either of AZD1222 or an mRNA vaccine): 6 after an 
AZD1222 booster, and 2 after an mRNA booster. The 2 cases after an mRNA booster are not 
further discussed here as they do not concern the use of AZD1222 as a booster. Time to onset 
was available in 6 of the 8 cases and ranged from 1 to 60 days with a median TTO of 12 days 
after 3rd dose. Time to onset by 14 days, 2 1  days, and 42 days is presented in Table 195. 
Of the 8 case reports ofTTS following Dose 3/booster, 3 were female (40%), and 3 were 
male. The age range ofvaccinees was from 21 to 74 years, age was not provided in 1 of the 
8 reports. Median age was 28 years and 1 of the vaccinees was > 50 years. Outcome in 2 cases 
were reported as Not recovered, 3 Recovering, 1 Fatal report. 
No confirmed cases of TTS following a heterologous AZD1222 booster have been identified. 
The rate of TTS following a homologous booster dose could not be estimated as the only 
potential homologous booster TTS case was in Mexico and exposure data are not available for 
Mexico.

AstraZeneca 
25 August 2022 
Using the estimated exposure of 12833861administered Dose 3/booster vaccinations with 
V AXZEVRIA in Brazil the reporting rate of thrombotic events in combination with 
thrombocytopenia (with time to onset ::; 21 days; 4 reports) following the Dose 3/booster 
V AXZEVRIA was estimated to be 0.3 1 per million doses. The rate of TTS following 
Dose 3/booster ofV AXZEVRIA is less compared to the background rate for all age groups 
(see Table 196 and Table 1 97) of5.62 (event rates per l M  PY per 2 1  days Truven Market 
Scan-201 9, aligned with the OHDSI TTS algorithm) and 10.75 (event rates per l M  PY per 
21 days Truven Market Scan-2019, aligned with the OHDSI TTS algorithm [with updated 
OHDSI aligned codelists and washout periods]). 
No new or emerging concern regarding TTS has been identified with booster doses of 
AZD1222. Based on the review of available safety data, there is no indication suggesting that 
the safety profile of an AZD 1222 booster after a primary series with another vaccine would be 
different with respect to TTS from that of a first vaccine dose of AZD1222.

V AXZEVRIA Dose 2: 03 August 2021 
V AXZEVRIA Dose 3: 06 September 2021 
There are events of medication error (subcutaneous 
route administration and expired product administered). 
The lot ID for reported Dose 2 and Dose 3 are same; 
hence, it cannot be confirmed as booster dose. There is 
no radiological confirmation for thrombosis event (site 
of thrombosis not reported), and the patient was treated 
with prednisolone for thrombocytopenia. No 
information on D-dimer and anti-PF4. 
Report was based on a social media post. 
There is very little information in this case. Not clear if 
this was V AXZEVRIA, as V AXZEVRIA is not used in 
Italy for booster dose. The patient died from the event 
of thrombosis during December 2021. 
No details were provided regarding the primary vaccine 
except that the suspect product COVID-19 Pfizer 
COMIRNATY was removed. This case is considered 
as booster dose based on dosing date of V AXZEVRIA. 
Venous thrombosis occurred 2 days after the last dose 
and pulmonary embolism occurred,  14 days after last 
dose. Events were confirmed by CT angiography of 
chest and abdominal aorta on 1 8  March 2022. Normal 
D-dimer and negative PF4.

Cohen et al 2022 conducted a study to determine if vaccination with V AZXEVRIA ( formerly 
AZD1222) induces an increase in levels of anti-PF4 IgG, we analyzed paired serum samples 
collected prior to and 1 5  days after vaccination with V AZXEVRIA or placebo from 
participants in a multicentre, randomized Phase 3 study (D8 1 10C00001). For the purposes of 
this exploratory, post-hoc analysis, all participants (1777 participants who received 
V AZXEVRIA and 888 who received placebo) in the immunogenicity sub-study with available 
serum samples obtained on both day 1 and day 15 were included, and their paired serum 
samples were assessed for anti-PF4 IgG using a validated IgG-specific PF4-polyvinylsulfate 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Immucor). None of the 2665 participants experienced 
TTS following administration of vaccine or placebo. In the V AZXEVRIA and placebo 
groups, respectively, 98.0% and 97.7% of baseline serum samples were classified as being 
negative for anti-PF4 IgG, as were 97.5% and 97.6% of Day 1 5  serum samples. Optical 
density (OD) assay values were similar between the V AZXEVRIA and placebo group at both 
baseline (median OD: 0. 100 and 0. 101, respectively; P = 0.441 6) and Day 15 (median OD: 
0. 105 and 0.099, respectively; P = 0.0567). Overall, 96.9% of paired samples in both groups 
(V AZXEVRIA:  1 708/1762; placebo: 850/877) were classified as negative at baseline and also 
negative at Day 15. There was a minimal increase in OD values in the V AZXEVRIA arm 
from baseline to Day 1 5  (median OD: 0. 1 00 to 0. 105; P = 0.4); all were classified as 
moderate. None of these individuals in the V AZXEVRIA group increased to a high level of 
anti-PF4 IgG at Day 1 5  compared to 1 in the placebo group, while 1 0/35 (28.6%) and 
6/20 (30.0%), respectively, decreased below the threshold for positivity. These data indicate 
that V AZXEVRIA does not induce a clinically relevant general increase in anti-PF4 IgG.

AstraZeneca comment: Data from publications and case reports have noted that individuals 
experiencing TTS after receiving V AXZEVRIA, had elevated levels of antibodies targeting 
platelet factor 4 (PF4). Data from this analysis demonstrates that AZD1222 did not result in an 
increased rate of detection of anti-PF4 IgG post-vaccination compared to placebo during the 
period of highest TTS risk (first 1 5  days after vaccination). The identification of specific 
markers associated with the development of TTS is challenging due to the extremely rare 
frequency ofTTS. 
Pitkanen et al 2021 conducted a study to assess antibodies in interaction with the activation of 
platelets and complement triggered by Vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia 
(VITT). Antibodies against adenovirus type 2 hexon protein, ChAdOxl adenoviral vector­
specific IgG and PF4 were analyzed by enzyme immunoassays from VITT patients (n = 5). 
The EDTA plasma samples of the patients and controls were used to measure both terminal 
complement complexes (TCC) by ELISA and aggregation of healthy donor platelets. We 
studied the effects of human immunoglobulin (IVIG) and glycoprotein lib/Illa inhibitor 
(GPilb/Illa) on spontaneous and collagen-induced platelet aggregation supplemented with 
VITT plasma. VITT plasma had anti-PF4 antibodies and elevated TCC levels as a sign of 
complement activation. In isolated healthy donor platelets, VITT patient plasma caused 
marked, spontaneous aggregation of platelets, which was abolished by eptifibatide and high­
dose therapeutic IVIG. Authors suggest that VITT is triggered by antibodies against 
adenovirus vector and PF4- polyanion complexes which strongly co-activate complement and 
platelets. The spontaneous platelet aggregation was suppressed by IVIG or eptifibatide, 
indicating that besides FcyRII, also GPilb/Illa receptor exerts platelet procoagulant role in 
VITT. 
AstraZeneca comment: this study assessed antibodies against adenovirus vaccine and PF4-
polyanion complexes in TTSNITT, and provides new data on immunological stimulus that 
co-activates the complement system and triggers spontaneous aggregation of healthy platelets. 
This study does not address whether V AZXEVRIA causes a generalized increase in antibody 
levels post administration, also involvement ofprocoagulant microvesicles was not 
investigated, which have shown a potential role in VITT in other studies. 
Bhur et al 2022 investigated blood and thrombus specimens of a female patient who suffered 
severe stroke due to VITT after vaccination with ChAdOxl in comparison to 13 control stroke 
patients with similar clinical characteristics. Authors analyzed cerebral thrombi using 
histological examination, staining of complement factors, NET-markers, DNase and LL-37. 
NET markers were identified in thrombi of all patients. Interestingly, the thrombus of the 
VITT-patient exclusively revealed complement factors and high amounts ofDNase and LL-
37, serum of the VITT-patient inhibited reactive oxygen species-dependent NET-release by 
phorbol-myristate-acetate to a lesser degree compared to controls, indicating either less 
efficient NET-inhibition or enhanced NET-induction in the blood of the VITT-patient. The

authors suggest that not only an increased NETosis but also a disturbed endogenous 
degradation ofNETs may be involved in thrombogenesis during VITT, contributing further to 
NETosis with a subsequent inflammatory response in the sense of a vicious cycle, and thus 
leading to an exaggerated pro-thrombotic state. 
AstraZeneca comment: these findings are from a single subject with VITT and these are not 
compared with other cases of VITT. These findings need to be interpreted with caution and as 
potentially hypothesis generating. 
Schonbom et al 2022 conducted a periodic evaluation of VITT antibody status (study registry, 
EUP AS45098) in a cohort of 69 patients with a history of VITT who had received an 
adenovirus vector Covid-1 9  vaccine. Of these patients, 24 did not receive any subsequent 
doses of a Covid-1 9  vaccine; the remaining 45 patients received subsequent doses of a 
messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine (either the COMIRNATY [Pfizer- BioNTech] or the 
mRNA-1273 [Modema] vaccine). Of these patients, 3 1  received a second dose and 
14 received a third dose. Of the 69 patients, COVID-1 9  developed in 1 1  (16%), all of whom 
had mild symptoms. Covid-1 9  occurred more frequently in the patients who had received only 
the adenovirus vector vaccine than in those who had subsequently received one or two doses 
of an mRNA vaccine (7 of 24 patients [29%] vs. 4 of 45 patients [9%]; P = 0.04 by Fisher's 
exact test). In all the patients who had contracted COVID-19, a follow-up blood sample that 
was obtained after their recovery was available at a median of 2 weeks after the onset of 
infection. No major increases in PF4-antibody levels developed after recovery from COVID-
1 9. In most of the patients, repeat optical density readings were lower than those in the last 
sample obtained before the onset of COVID, a finding that was consistent with the inherent 
natural decline in anti- PF4 antibodies. No patient had recurrent thrombocytopenia, new or 
recurrent thrombosis, or reversion to a positive platelet-activation assay. 
AstraZeneca Comment: Authors noted that Covid-1 9  does not restimulate anti- PF4 
antibodies in patients with a history of VITT. As described in section 4.3 of the CDS, 
V AZXEVRIA is contraindicated in vaccinees with major venous and/or arterial thrombosis in 
combination with thrombocytopenia following vaccination with any COVID-1 9  vaccine. 
Published post DLP, Laffan et al 2022 presented a review of the clinical characteristics of all 
reports of TTS occurring after vaccination with V AXZEVRIA in the AstraZeneca Global 
Safety Database up to 28 December 202 1 .  The authors conclude that the reporting rate of 
'typical' /'possible' TTS post first-dose vaccination in this dataset is 7.5 per million vaccinated 
persons, with few cases were reported after subsequent doses, including booster doses. They 
found that peak reporting coincided with media-driven attention and that medical history 
differences versus a reference population indicate potentially unidentified risk factors. The 
publication also concluded that decreasing fatality rate correlates with increasing awareness 
and publication of diagnostic/treatment guidelines. The authors also present an algorithm to

classify potential TTS cases and state that comprehensive reporting could help further 
improve definition and management of this extremely rare syndrome. This article was co­
authored by AstraZeneca and presents a review of ICSR case characteristics reported to 
AstraZeneca through to 28 December 2 1 .  This includes data and analysis already included in 
previous PBRERs/monthly summary reports, as well as in the cumulative review presented 
above in this PBRER, and therefore presents no new, additional evidence. 
CVST with thrombocytopenia 
Of the 2391 thrombosis with thrombocytopenia case reports reviewed cumulatively, the 
reported venous thrombotic sites included CYST (HLT: Cerebrovascular venous and sinus 
thrombosis) in 585 (25%) cases. Of these 585 cases, 64% were in females, 35% occurred in 
males, and in 1 % gender was unknown. 
In 1 73 of the 585 (29%) of the CYST with Thrombocytopenia cases were fatal. CYST with 
thrombocytopenia cases by age group/gender/dose and fatality are provided in Table 204.

Reporting rates for CYST in combination with thrombocytopenia across age groups based on 
the data from the UK and EEA by risk window of 2 1  days and 42 days are provided in 
Table 205 and Table 206 respectively; reporting rate is also stratified by Dose 1 and Dose 2. 
The reporting rate of CYST in combination with thrombocytopenia in the UK was higher 
across the age groups when compared to the background rate except for reports in vaccinees 
aged > 65 years (risk window 21 days) and > 50 years (risk window 42 days) with Dose 2. 
The reporting rate of CYST in combination with thrombocytopenia in the EEA was higher 
when compared to the background rate in vaccinees aged < 70 years with all doses. In the 
EEA the reporting rate of CYST in combination with thrombocytopenia with Dose 2 was 
higher than the background rate for vaccinees aged < 49 years, however reporting rate in age 
group > 50 years was less compared to the background rate. 
The observed versus expected analyses for TTS (including CYST) and CYST with 
thrombocytopenia are presented in Appendix 1 8  Tables 2,3,4 and Table 10. Background rates 
for TTS were derived from MarketScan (US claims) data, using OHDSI-aligned code lists and 
definitions for TTS. 
Algorithm 2 for TTS uses updated OHDSI-aligned code lists and washout periods (previously 
patients with thrombosis in the 2 years prior to 201 9  were excluded). The results of the 
observed versus expected analyses suggests that observed cases of CYST with 
thrombocytopenia are more than expected for all age stratifications. 
Conservatively, the exposure for global reports (448306152) is based on doses administered in 
1 3  markets as explained in Appendix 8.

Summary 
AstraZeneca 
25 August 2022 
The highest number of cases were reported from UK (55%) while receiving 49.02 million 
doses of the total worldwide doses. 
The analysis of thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia following the second dose 
of V AXZEVRIA showed that the rate of events was extremely low and lower than after 
administration of the first dose. The majority of the vaccinees who experienced TTS events 
post Dose 2 were male (59% vs 42%) and were older (Median age was 65.5 years vs. 45 
years) compared to first dose recipients. The median time to onset of second dose cases was 
14 days compared to12 days for the cases with first dose. 
Overall, the most common events were Cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, Deep vein 
thrombosis, Pulmonary embolism, and Thrombosis. 
The time to onset was available for all doses in 78% (1 875/2391) of cases; TTO was reported 
in 77% (1637/ 2 123) for Dose 1 and 89% (232/ 260) for Dose 2. Overall, there were more 
fatal reports for TTO within 14 and 2 1  days. Seventy-three (73%) percent of the fatal reports 
occurred with 14 days compare to 64% for all cases and 87% of the fatal report occurred with 
2 1  days compare to 80% for all cases. 
The highest fatality rate for all dosage in female vaccinees was 28/1 17 (24%) in 1 8  to 29 years 
of age and male vaccinees was 21/93 (23%) in 30 to 39 years of age. The fatality rate in 
female vaccinees in Dose 1 found 28/1 1 1  (25%) in 1 8-29 years, whereas in male vaccinees it 
was 16/72 (22%) in  1 8  to 29 years of age and 2 1/92 (22%) in 30 to 39 years. The fatality rate 
in Dose 2 found in females was 2/27 (33%) in 60 to 69 years of age and in males 7/45 (15%) 
in 70 to 79 years age group. 
No new or emerging concern regarding TTS post-booster has been identified with booster 
doses of V AXZEVRIA. 
The highest number of fatal reports (28%) occurred due to HL T of Cerebrovascular venous 
and sinus thrombosis. Cerebral haemorrhage was the most common bleeding event associated 
with fatal event. The total number and percent of fatal reports since April 202 1 are decreasing 
compared to January 2021 to March 202 1 .  There is an increased fatality rate in 
December 202 1 ;  however, only 25 cases were reported in this month received which could 
explain the sharp increase in the percentages. There is an increased fatality rate in April 202 1 
(9 reported fatal events out of 3 1  reports) compared to the earlier months December 202 1 and 
March 202 1 .  Number and percent of fatal reports since April 202 1 has decreased compared to 
January to March 2021 and percent of fatal reports decreased from May 2022 to June 2022.

The arterial events were reported highest in the age groups of 50 to 59 and 60 to 69 years. The 
distribution of events in male and female was roughly equal. The mixed or the combined 
arterial and venous events were equally distributed in age groups of 30 to 39,40 to 49,50 to 59 
and 60 to 69 years, and the distribution of cases in female and male was roughly equal. The 
venous events were reported highest in the age groups of 40 to 49, 50 to 59, and 60 to 69 
years; the occurrence in females was higher than in males. 
The most common confounding factors in descending order of frequency in all 2391 cases 
were autoimmune conditions, malignancy, history of heparin, obesity, and concomitant use of 
contraceptives. The most common confounding factors in the confirmed reports were history 
of heparin use and malignancy. The dates of heparin administered were not reported in all 
cases. 
Conclusion 
Based on currently available data, no new safety information concerning TTS was identified. 
The current risk minimisation measures described in the product information are considered 
adequate. 
From the data identified during the reporting period and also taking into account the 
cumulative experience, no updates to the V AXZEVRIA CDS or RMP are warranted at this 
time. 
Thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia/TTS is contained in Section 4.4 (Special 
warnings and special precautions for use) and 4.8 in the V AXZEVRIA CDS. In addition, 
V AXZEVRIA is contraindicated (CDS Section 4.3) for use in any persons who have 
experienced thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia with any COVID-1 9  vaccine. 
Finally, thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia/ TTS is listed as an Important 
Identified Risk in the Core and EU RMPs for V AXZEVRIA. As such, the topic will continue 
to be kept under close safety surveillance by AstraZeneca and further actions will be taken as 
deemed appropriate. 
More detailed information regarding this Important identified risk is provided in 
Section 1 6.4. 1 . 1 .  
16.3.3 
The AES Is for V AXZEVRIA and associated PTs are listed in Appendix 7. 
New information on other potential risks not categorised as important 
AESis listed in Appendix 7 for V AXZEVRIA have been included for an O/E analyses for this 
PBRER and results are provided in Appendix 8 (O/E Analyses). Following an agreement with 
the MHRA, the frequency of the O/E analyses have been reduced from biweekly to 6-monthly 
aligned with PBRER.

16.3.4.1  Reactogenicity 
A cumulative search of the AstraZeneca Global Safety database through 28 June 2022 was 
conducted to identify serious, medically confirmed cases of reactogenicity with V AXZEVRIA 
(COVID-1 9  AstraZeneca Vaccine). The PTs used to define reactogenicity included: 
Headache, Nausea, Vomiting, Myalgia, Arthralgia, Injection site bruising, Injection site pain, 
Injection site pruritus, Injection site swelling, Injection site warmth, Injection site erythema, 
Fatigue, Malaise, Chills, Pyrexia, and Lymphadenopathy. 
For the reporting period, a total of 79137 cases involving 21 8686 events ofreactogenicity 
were identified from the Safety database. Of these 79137 cases, there were 248 1 serious and 
medically confirmed initial cases of reactogenic events with V AXZEVRIA. Of the 
248 1  cases, 1 549 (62.5%) occurred in females, 846 (34%) in males, and 86 (3.5%) were of 
unknown gender. The distribution of the reactogenic events in the reporting interval and 
cumulative is presented in Table 207. 
Cumulatively, a total of 501 840 cases ofreactogenicity were identified from the global safety 
database. Of these 501 840 cases, there were 13940 serious, medically confirmed cases of 
reactogenic events with V AXZEVRIA. Of the 13940 cases, 9663 (69%) occurred in females, 
3998 (29%) in males, and 279 (2%) cases were of unknown gender. The distribution of the 
reactogenic events in the reporting interval and cumulative is presented in Table 207.

The commonly reported events of reactogenicity for both the interval period and cumulatively 
were pyrexia and headache, followed by myalgia, fatigue, nausea, and chills. 
A review of the safety information identified during the reporting period, and also considering 
the cumulative experience, did not change the current understanding of this topic. 
Reactogenicity is considered appropriately described in the V AXZEVRIA CDS. 
Conclusion 
Data provided by the MAH, as well as found in literature, did not raise any new safety issue. 
The reactogenicity profile ofV AXZEVRIA is considered as appropriately described in the 
product information at this stage. 
16.3.4.2  Tinnitus 
AstraZeneca received a signal in the preliminary assessment report from PRAC on 
V AXZEVRIA 2nd PBRER (28 June 2021 - 28 December 2021 ,  to add tinnitus as ADRs to the 
EU label for V AXZEVRIA due to the number of reports identified with a temporal 
relationship (despite having risk/confounding factors). AstraZeneca further reviewed this 
topic, and this signal was internally validated on 20 May 2022. 
A cumulative search of the AstraZeneca Global Patient Safety Database through 30 April 
2022 was conducted for AE reports of Tinnitus in association with the use of V AXZEVRIA. 
The search term included PT Tinnitus. Please also refer to Section 1 5  .2. 1 .  for data until DLP 
for this report, according to request from PRAC. 
In clinical studies, an imbalance between V AXZEVRIA and placebo is noted in the US study 
(D8 1 1 0C0000 1 ), for tinnitus and V AXZEVRIA (28 [0. 1 % ] versus 3 [ <0. 1  % ]); randomization 
ratio was 2: 1). Out of the 28 events reporting Tinnitus in the AZD1222 arm, 1 0  reported 
having the event resolved within 7 days after event onset, 6 resolved after a longer time (8-78 
days), 1 was resolving and 1 1  events had not yet resolved at the time ofreporting. 
An AZ Global Safety Database search retrieved 7442 cases reporting an AE of Tinnitus. A 
majority of the events were reported within 3 days (65%) and within 7 days (78%) after

vaccination (any dose). Of these, 12 reported a recurrence or worsening (interpreted as 
rechallenge), and of those, 9 cases reported a risk factor or a confounding factor. However, 
due to the recurrence and temporal relationship to both doses, causality with V AXZEVRIA 
cannot be excluded. 
In regards the AE duration, 12.6% of 7442 cases reported outcomes ofrecovered or recovered 
with sequelae. Of those 84% of the cases recovered within 7 days and occurred within the 
reactogenicity period. Of note, 66.3% of the total number of cases report the event as "Not 
recovered", although, follow-up information is rarely provided. An 0/E analysis showed that 
the observed events were significantly less than the expected events for all age, sex 
stratifications, and risk windows. 
The medical/scientific literature review revealed one new case report with a temporal 
association with V AXZEVRIA, yet an alternative explanation for the event (glaucoma) was 
observed. With regard to mechanism of action for COVID-1 9  vaccines and tinnitus, the 
authors considered it undetermined and unconfirmed. Though, potential pathophysiological 
mechanisms discussed included molecular mimicry, autoimmune reaction, and anxiety­
related reaction. 
The quantitative signal searches from external databases (EVDAS and WHO VigiBase) for 
V AXZEVRIA -Tinnitus shows disproportionate reporting. 
Conclusion 
Based on the evaluation of currently available information from various sources, AstraZeneca 
considers that there is a reasonable possibility of a causal association between V AXZEVRIA 
and tinnitus. V AXZEVRIA CDS Section 4.8 (undesirable effects) is updated to include 
'Tinnitus' during this reporting period (01 July 2022). A review of the safety information 
identified during the reporting period, and also taking into account the cumulative experience 
did not change the current understanding of this topic. 
16.3.4.3  Hypoaesthesia and Paraesthesia 
AstraZeneca received a signal from Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), Australia, to 
add hypoaesthesia and paraesthesia as ADRs to the local label for V AXZEVRIA as these 
were the most commonly reported adverse reactions reported to TGA for all COVID-1 9  
vaccines, including V AXZEVRIA. AstraZeneca further reviewed this topic, and this signal 
was internally validated on 25 January 2022. 
A search conducted in the AstraZeneca Clinical database for AE reports of Hypoaesthesia and 
Paraesthesia resulted in 1 5  (0. 1  %) case reports ofhypoaesthesia in the AZD1222 group in 
comparison to 20 cases (0. 1 %) in the control group and 42 (0.3%) case reports ofparaesthesia 
in the AZD1222 group in comparison to 5 1  cases (0.4%) in the control group from the Oxford

Pooled studies (COV00l ,  COV002, COV003, and COV005). In the United States (US) study 
(D8 1 10C00001) with a data cut-off date of 05 March 2021 ,  there were 33 cases (0.2%) of 
hypoaesthesia in the AZD1222 group in comparison to 1 1  cases (0. 1 %) in the placebo group 
and 64 cases ofparaesthesia (0.3%) in the AZD1222 group in comparison to 29 cases (0.3%) 
in the placebo group. 
The medical/scientific literature review conducted to obtain information on literature articles 
about hypoaesthesia and paraesthesia identified 1 7  articles, which included 1 case report of 
hypoaesthesia and 20 case reports of paraesthesia after administration of V AXZEVRIA. 
Relevant underlying neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, acute 
disseminated encephalomyelitis, acute myelitis, polyradiculoneuropathy, lupus, and vaccine­
induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia were associated with these cases. 
Hypoaesthesia and paraesthesia may be symptoms of these underlying disorders. 
A cumulative search of the AstraZeneca Global Patient Safety Database through 12 December 
2021 was conducted for AE reports ofhypoaesthesia and paraesthesia in association with the 
use of V AXZEVRIA. 
The search retrieved 10736 cases reporting an AE with a PT ofhypoaesthesia, of which 2022 
(18.8%) were medically confirmed reports of which 5322 (49.6%) reports were serious. Of the 
1 0736 cases, hypoaesthesia was reported after Dose 1 in 6372 (59.4%) cases, after Dose 2 in 
925 (8.6%) cases, after Dose 3 (booster dose) in 6 ( < 0. 1 % ) cases, after both Dose 1 and Dose 
2 in 8 ( < 0. 1 % ) cases, and dose details were unknown in the remaining 3425 (3 1 .9%) cases. 
Approximately 48% of the events had an outcome of recovered, recovered with sequelae, or 
were recovering. Of the 1 0736 cases ofhypoaesthesia, there were 1 9  cases (9 medically 
confirmed and 10 consumer) with a fatal outcome. These cases with a fatal outcome had 
comorbidities or other co-reported events eg, cerebral infraction, acute myocardial infraction, 
brain stem haemorrhage, peripheral artery thrombosis, and pneumonia aspiration that led to a 
fatal outcome. These cases had limited information for further assessment. One case reported 
both hypoesthesia and paraesthesia. 
Of the 10736 cases ofhypoaesthesia, 1019 (9.5%) reported hypoaesthesia as a solo event, of 
which 281 (27.6%) were medically confirmed reports and 243 (23.8%) were reported as 
serious. Of the 1019 cases, 28 1 were medically confirmed. Of the 281 medically confirmed 
cases, 255 had limited information which precluded a proper case assessment, and the 
remaining 26 included confounding medical history and/or confounding concomitant 
medications. Confounding medications included allopurinol, amitriptyline, amlodipine, 
atorvastatin, azithromycin, candesartan, clonazepam, digoxin, doxycycline, eplerenone, 
esomeprazole, estradiol, fluticasone, fluoxetine hydrochloride, itraconazole, lansoprazole,

diabetes, osteoarthritis, smoking, transient ischemic attack, hypoaesthesia, and brainstem 
cavemoma. 
A cumulative search of the AstraZeneca Global Patient Safety Database conducted for AE 
reports of paraesthesia retrieved 1 7721  cases reporting an AE with a PT of paraesthesia, of 
which 2785 (15.7%) were medically confirmed reports and 7642 (43. 1  %) reports were 
serious. Of the 1 772 1 cases, paraesthesia was reported after Dose 1 in 1025 1 (57.8%) cases, 
after Dose 2 in 1607 (9 . 1  % ) cases, after Dose 3 (booster dose) in 9 ( < 0. 1 % ) cases, after both 
Dose 1 and Dose 2 in 7 (< 0.1 %) cases, and dose details were unknown in the remaining 5847 
(32.9%) cases. The TTO from the most recent dose ranged from the same day of vaccination 
in 5377 (30.3%) cases, 1 to 3 days in 4465 (25.2%) cases, 4 to 7 days in 1 175 (6.6%) cases, 8 
to 15 days in 883 ( 5 .0%) cases, > 1 5  days in 907 ( 5 . 1  % ) cases, and TTO was unknown or not 
reported in the remaining 4914 (27.7%) cases. Approximately 45% of the events had an 
outcome of recovered, recovered with sequelae, or were recovering. Of the 1 7721  cases of 
paraesthesia, there were 9 cases (4 medically confirmed and 5 consumer) with a fatal 
outcome. These cases with a fatal outcome had comorbidities or other co-reported events eg, 
cardia arrest, ischaemic stroke, and agonal death struggle that led to a fatal outcome. These 
cases had limited information for further assessment. One case reported both hypoesthesia and 
paraesthesia. 
Of the 1772 1 cases of paraesthesia, 2030 (1 1 .5%) reported paraesthesia as a solo event, of 
which 406 (20.0%) were medically confirmed reports and 393 (19.4%) were serious events. 
Of the 2030 cases, 406 were medically confirmed of which 355 had limited information which 
precluded a proper case assessment, and the remaining 5 1  cases included confounding medical 
history and/or confounding concomitant medications. Confounding medications included 
amiodarone, allopurinol, amitriptyline, amlodipine, atorvastatin, estradiol, and salbutamol. 
Confounding medical history included diabetes, carpal tunnel syndrome, anxiety, chronic 
kidney disease, influenza virus vaccine, smoking, hypothyroidism, transient ischemic attack, 
neuropathy, alcohol use disorder, Amold-Chiari syndrome, stroke, multiple sclerosis, 
Raynaud's syndrome, and unspecified cerebrovascular disease. 
The data from the clinical studies and literature was not indicative of a causal relationship. 
However, of the 6861 (63.9%) hypoaesthesia cases and 1 1324 (63.9%) paraesthesia cases that 
were reported with reactogenicity events, 2482 (36.2%) hypoaesthesia cases and 3719 
(32.8%) paraesthesia cases, respectively, were reported on the same day of vaccination. The 
comparatively high number of reports with a plausible temporal relationship between the 
vaccination and the occurrence of the reported events, together with the lack of alternative 
explanations, was suggestive of a causal association between V AXZEVRIA (AZD 1222) and 
the events of hypoaesthesia and paraesthesia appearing concurrently with other reactogenicity 
events.

During the period covered by this PBRER, the Core Data Sheet (CDS) for AZD1222 is 
amended with 'Hypoaesthesia' and 'Paraesthesia' in Section 4.8 (undesirable effects). 
Conclusion: 
Based on the evaluation of currently available information from all available sources, with 
particular focus on post-market data, AstraZeneca considers that there is a reasonable 
possibility of a causal association between V AXZEVRIA and hypoaesthesia and paraesthesia. 
Many of these events were co-reported with reactogenicity events. The information regarding 
hypoaesthesia and paraesthesia were added to the CDS and the company will continue to 
conduct routine pharmacovigilance activities on this safety topic. Hypoaesthesia and 
Paraesthesia are considered appropriately described in the V AXZEVRIA CDS (Section 4.8). 
A review of the safety information identified during the reporting period, and also taking into 
account the cumulative experience did not change the current understanding of this topic.

During the reporting period,  1 527 case reports were retrieved using the above search strategy; 
however,  124 case reports were excluded since these cases were non-valid (duplicate cases or 
invalid cases). The remaining 1403 (969 initial and 434 follow-up reports) cases were 
considered for further analysis. Of the 1403 reports,  1 096 reports included 
pregnancy/breastfeeding reports with other co-reported AEs and 307 reports were without 
other AEs. 
Of the 1403 reports of exposure to V AXZEVRIA during or before pregnancy/breastfeeding, 
1 3  were from interventional clinical trials, 417 were from post-marketing studies, and 
973 were spontaneous. Of these 1403 reports, 502 were medically confirmed (174 serious and 
328 non-serious). 
Outcome of pregnancy cases are summarized below: 
Of the total 1403 case reports, there were 1 3 1  cases of spontaneous abortion (SAB), 3 cases of 
abortion missed, 42 case reports with abnormal neonatal outcome, 4 case reports of stillbirth, 
29 case reports of premature babies, 10 case reports of foetal death, 5 case reports of sudden 
infant death syndrome, 1 3  case reports with breech presentation, and 3 case reports of ectopic 
pregnancy. Pregnancy outcome was not available for the majority of cases. 
Cumulative Review (through 28 June 2022) 
Cumulatively through 28 June 2022, 5575 case reports were retrieved using the above search 
criteria; however, 207 case reports were excluded since these cases were non-valid (duplicate 
cases or invalid cases). 
The remaining 5322 cases were considered for further analysis. Of the 5322 reports, 4698 
reports included pregnancy/breastfeeding reports with other AEs and 624 reports were without 
AEs. 
Of the 5322 reports of exposure to V AXZEVRIA during or before pregnancy/breastfeeding, 
28 were from interventional clinical trials, 769 were from post-marketing studies, and 4525 
were spontaneous. Of these 5322 reports, 1051 were medically confirmed (377 serious and 
674 non-serious). 
Spontaneous Abortion - Interval Review 
A total of 1 3 1  pregnancy cases resulted in spontaneous abortion, of which 83% (109 out of 
1 3 1) were reports from consumers and 1 7% (22 out of 1 3 1) of the reports were medically 
confirmed, with 7 1  % of the reports being from the UK. Age was reported in 107 of the 1 3 1  
case reports; median age was 34 years (range: from 1 9  to 43 years; 6 reports in women aged < 
25 years, 61  reports in women aged 26 to 35 years, and 40 reports were in women aged > 36 
years). There was one case of a 59-year-old female that was miscoded to include an event of

Abortion spontaneous. In 92 of the 1 3 1  reports, gestational week at the time spontaneous 
abortion was unknown; in the remaining 39 reports, 34 (87.2%) occurred in the 1 st trimester, 
5 (12.8%) were during the 2nd trimester, and none were during the 3rd trimester. In 124 of the 
1 3 1  reports, gestational age at the time of exposure was unknown; in the remaining 7 reports, 
6 (85.7%) were exposed in the 1 st trimester, 1 (14.3%) was exposed during the 2nd trimester, 
and none were exposed during the 3rd trimester. 
Spontaneous Abortion - Cumulative Review 
A total of 386 pregnancy cases resulted in spontaneous abortion. A total of 83% (32 1  out of 
3 86) were reports from consumers and 1 7% of the reports were medically confirmed, with 
7 1  % of the reports being from the UK. Age was reported in 334 of the 386 case reports; 
median age was 34 years (range: from 1 9  to 50 years; 28 reports in women aged < 25 years, 
1 69 reports in women aged 26 to 35 years, and 137 reports were in women aged > 36 years). 
In 204 of the 3 86 reports, gestational week at the time spontaneous abortion was unknown; in 
the remaining 1 82 reports, 166 (91 .2%) occurred in the 1 st trimester, 14 (7.7%) were during 
the 2nd trimester, and 2 (1 . 1  %) were during the 3rd trimester. In 326 of the 386 reports, 
gestational age at the time of exposure was unknown; in the remaining 60 reports, 52 (86.7%) 
were exposed in the 1 st trimester, 8 (13.3%) were exposed during the 2nd trimester, and none 
were exposed during the 3rd trimester. 
Observed Vs. Expected Analysis - Spontaneous abortion 
The incidence rates for spontaneous abortions were calculated based on the reported rates by 
Hemminki and Forssas 1999 data on conceptions among women in England and Wales, 201 8  
from the UK Office ofNational Statistics (Conceptions in England and Wales 201 8) to 
estimate the rates of spontaneous abortions per 100,000 women years. 
Vaccine administration data based on the age and gender is only available from UK and the 
below analysis was based on case reports from UK. The observed versus expected analysis of 
spontaneous abortions with DLP 28 June 2022 showed that observed cases occurred 
significantly less frequently than expected for overall and for different age stratifications from 
UK. A summary of spontaneous abortion observed versus expected analysis is presented in 
Table 208. 
Conservatively, the exposure for global reports (448306152) is based on doses administered in 
1 3  markets as explained in Appendix 8.

The most common relevant risk factors reported in the cases included previous history of 
gestational diabetes, increased body mass index (BMI), hypertension, tobacco use, substance 
and alcohol use, multigravida, diabetes, history of spontaneous abortion and stillbirth, factor V 
Leiden mutation, previous "high risk pregnancy", history of kidney disease, Fabry's disease. 
No safety concern was identified from review of these reported PTs. 
Conclusion 
From the data identified during the reporting period, and also taking into account the 
cumulative experience, no causal relationship could be established between adverse maternal 
outcomes and V AXZEVRIA. Pregnancy and adverse maternal outcomes will continue to be 
kept under close surveillance by AstraZeneca. 
Co-reported Adverse Events in the Pregnancy Cases - Interval Review 
Of the 1403 pregnancy cases, 1 096 cases had reported AEs in both mothers and infants. Most 
of the AEs reported in these cases were known reactogenicity events (Headache, Pyrexia, 
Fatigue, Chills, Myalgia, Nausea, Pain in extremity and Arthralgia). There were 82 cases with 
2 1 8  AEs that occurred in the pediatric population, with the top 3 AEs being: Foetal exposure 
during pregnancy (50), Exposure via breast milk (22), and COVID-1 9  (10). There was no 
trend or signal observed from these AEs reported from the pregnancy cases.

section regarding Use ofV AXZEVRIA in pregnant women (Section 1 6.3.5. 1 . 1). The cases 
reported during this interval are described below: 
Review of the 42 cases with adverse neonatal outcomes received during the reporting period 
did not highlight any new significant safety concern. The majority of cases were either 
confounded or contained limited information to ascribe a causal relationship to V AXZEVRIA. 
Case IDs for these 42 cases are: 
AstraZeneca comment: Due to some confounders in maternal history (including but not 
limited to history of multiple miscarriages, eclampsia, tobacco, alcohol and recreational drug 
use) and limited information on complete demographics ofvaccinee, baseline health condition 
before vaccination, relevant medical history, obstetric history, relevant family history, 
concurrent diseases, concomitant medications, details of the event, further circumstances 
surrounding the event, outcome of the event, further risk factors (such as chromosomal 
abnormalities, cerebral anoxia, severe maternal malnutrition and chronic conditions, smoking, 
alcohol and drugs exposure, maternal infections such as toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus, 
rubella, varicella and zika virus), genetic factors, other congenital abnormalities such as spina 
bifida, smoking during pregnancy, oligohydramnios) and detailed diagnostic and etiologic 
workup (physical examination, neurological, genetics testing, imaging studies such as 
Ultrasound and X-ray), the evaluation did not find evidence to suggest a causal relationship 
between all neonatal outcomes and V AXZEVRIA. 
Conclusion 
From the data identified during the reporting period, and also taking into account the 
cumulative experience, no causal relationship could be established between these events 
reported in neonates and V AXZEVRIA. Pregnancy and neonatal outcomes continue to be kept 
under close surveillance by AstraZeneca.

Qiao et al 2021 presented the analysis an observational cross-sectional study using data from 
the Brazilian surveillance information system for adverse events (SI-EAPV) to characterize 
the safety ofCOVID-1 9  vaccines available (CoronaVac /Butantan, Pfizer/BioNTech, 
AstraZeneca and Janssen) in Brazilian pregnant and postpartum women after vaccination from 
April to August 2021 .  A total of 803563 doses were received, of which 65435 were the 
AstraZeneca vaccine. A total of 3,333 adverse events following COVID-1 9  immunization 
were reported for the study population in the SIEAPV. The incidence of AEs found was 
309.4/100,000 doses (95% CI 297.23, 321.51). Of those, 473 were from women who received 
CoronaVac /Butantan, 788 Pfizer/BioNTech, 2,016 AstraZeneca and 56 Janssen vaccines. The 
most common maternal AE notified by pregnant and postpartum women included spontaneous 
abortion (2.37%) pregnancy bleeding (0.76%) and neonatal death (0.52%). Among the non­
maternal AE, headache (18.54%), fever ( 1 3.79%), myalgia (10.30%) and pain (7.60%) were 
the most reported. The authors concluded that a similar pattern of AE as stated in other studies 
was found, with even better results for non-viral vector vaccines, corroborating to the 
recommendation of vaccination for these groups. 
AstraZeneca comment: The study found that AEs were similar to those from the available 
literature for other studies that assessed safety of COVID-1 9  vaccines in different populations 
groups. 
Summary 
In summary, the cumulative and periodic review up until 28 June 2022 of all reports of 
exposure to V AXZEVRIA during pregnancy did not identify any new safety concerns for the 
mother or the babies. The reported adverse events are similar between the pregnant and non­
pregnant populations. 
The results of the 0/E analyses for spontaneous abortion (UK reports) suggest that observed 
cases are less than would be expected in the unvaccinated pregnant women. 
Conclusion 
Based on these interval and cumulative reviews of the currently available data, it is 
AstraZeneca's opinion that no updates to product labelling or RMP are warranted. Use of 
V AXZEVRIA during pregnancy remains as Missing information for the product and is 
closely monitored.

During the interval period, there were 32 reports pertaining to infant exposure to 
V AXZEVRIA during breastfeeding. Overall, 3 cases were serious ( of which 1 was medically 
confirmed). Within these 32 reports, (3 serious, 29 non-serious) reported 68 events in infants 
following breastfeeding. Of these 68 events, 9 were serious adverse events. Events occurring 
with a frequency of2 or more in paediatric cases are shown in Table 21 1 .  No safety concern 
was identified.

There were no fatal cases reported within the infant lactation cases. Outcomes of these 32 
cases were: Unknown (1 8), Recovered (7), Not recovered (5), and Recovering (2). 
In the interval review ofreports ofV AXZEVRIA exposure during breastfeeding in the 
AstraZeneca Global Safety Database, there was limited information to suggest any reasonable 
association between exposure to V AXZEVRIA via breastfeeding and adverse outcomes in the 
neonates. 
No safety relevant literature relating to V AXZEVRIA and breastfeeding was identified during 
the reporting period. 
Cumulative Review (29 December 2020 - 28 June 2022) 
Cumulatively through 28 June 2022, there were 247 reports pertaining to infant exposure to 
V AXZEVRIA during breastfeeding. Overall, 1 1 8 cases were serious ( of which  10 were 
medically confirmed). Within these 247 reports, 247 cases (1 1 8  serious, 129 non-serious) 
reported 764 events in infants following breastfeeding. Of these 764 events, 327 were serious 
adverse events. No safety concern was identified. 
The section 4.6 of the CDS for V AXZEVRIA includes the following text on breastfeeding: 
Anti-SARS-CoV-2 S antibodies are excreted in breast milk of mothers vaccinated with 
V AXZEVRIA. In animal studies, lactational transfer of anti-SARS-Co V-2 S antibodies from 
maternal female mice to pups was observed. It is unknown whether the vaccine itself is 
excreted in human milk.

In animal studies no quantifiable levels of the vaccine were detected in the mammary gland in 
female mice. 
Available non-clinical, clinical and post-marketing data do not suggest a risk to breastfed 
newborns/infants. 
Conclusion 
From the data identified during the reporting period, and also taking into account the 
cumulative experience, there is no new safety information or a safety concern identified with 
the exposure to V AXZEVRIA during pregnancy or breast feeding. Use of V AXZEVRIA in 
pregnant and breastfeeding women I Use during pregnancy and while breastfeeding will 
continue to be considered missing information for V AXZEVRIA. 
Use of V AXZEVRIA in pregnant and breastfeeding women I Use during pregnancy and while 
breastfeeding will be primarily investigated in the ongoing non-interventional pregnancy 
registry study (D8 1 10C00003) of women exposed to V AXZEVRIA immediately before or 
during pregnancy as part of the C-VIPER Registry Consortium. Refer to Appendix 4 for 
additional details. 
More detailed information is provided in Section 1 6.4.3 . 1 .  
16.3.5.2  Use of AZD1222 in subjects with severe immunodeficiency 
Vaccines may be less effective in severely immunocompromised individuals, as the vaccinees 
weakened immune system may not mount a sufficient response. Additionally, 
immunocompromised individuals may also be at a greater risk of morbidity and mortality 
from vaccine-preventable disease, and consequently this population has been identified as a 
priority group for initial vaccination in several jurisdictions. Although there is no evidence 
that the safety profile of V AXZEVRIA in this population will be different than that of the 
general population, given the paucity of data, the possibility cannot be excluded.

A cumulative and interval search of the AstraZeneca Global Safety Database was undertaken 
for AE reports received for V AXZEVRIA in subjects with medical history of severe 
immunodeficiency and in immunocompromised patients, using MedDRA High Level Term:

Review of Literature 
A search ofEmbase and InsightMeme was conducted to identify literature articles on

and have been discussed here in detail. 
Benning et. al 2022 studied antibody response post vaccination in impaired kidney transplant 
recipients. They concluded that seroconverted kidney transplant recipients show impaired 
neutralization against emerging variants of concern after standard two-dose vaccination. After 
first vaccination with an mRNA or V AXZEVRIA, anti-S 1 IgG antibodies were significantly 
lower in kidney transplant recipients. This is the first study to provide an in-depth 
characterization of humoral responses to different variants of concern in kidney transplant 
recipients. Anti-S 1 IgG antibodies were significantly lower in kidney transplant recipients 
after homologous mRNA/mRNA and V AXZEVRIA/ V AXZEVRIA or heterologous 
V AXZEVRIA/mRNA standard two dose vaccination. Seroconversion rates were reduced after 
second vaccination in kidney transplant recipients, and neutralizing antibody levels were 
significantly lower compared with levels in healthy controls. After first vaccination with an 
mRNA or V AXZEVRIA anti-S 1 IgG antibodies were significantly lower in kidney transplant

recipients with median indices of 0. 1 (IQR,0-0.3) and 0. 1 (IQR, 0-0.3) compared with 9 
(IQR, 6--17; P,0.001) and 2 (IQR, 1-3; P,0.001), respectively, in the full healthy control 
cohort. First vaccination with V AXZEVRIA led to neutralizing antibody activity that did not 
differ between groups with a median of 2 1  % (IQR, 0%- 26%) in kidney transplant recipients 
compared with 16% (IQR, 5%-39%) in healthy controls. In both kidney transplant recipients 
and matched healthy controls, the neutralization activity against the variants of concern 
B. 1 .351 and B.1 .617.2 was significantly lower compared with activity against B. 1 . 1 .7(for all 
P,0.001). 
AZ comment: The author concluded that additional vaccinations appear to be required in 
kidney transplant recipients to maintain high levels of neutralizing antibodies for the variants 
with partial escape from neutralizing antibodies become more prevalent. AstraZeneca is 
monitoring the safety profile of V AXZEVRIA in immunocompromised individuals. 
Callagen et al. 2022 studied real-world, risk-adjusted vaccine effectiveness (VE) in solid 
organ transplant (SOT) recipients following 2 widely used SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in the 
United Kingdom. Incidence of testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA and risk of death within 
28 days following a positive test for SARS-CoV-2. Furthermore, VE was compared between 
the 2 most widely used vaccines in the United Kingdom, Pfizer-BioNTech ( CO MIRNA TY) 
and V AXZEVRIA. Of the 4147 SOT recipients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 
infection, 407 (9.8%) died within 28 days. Differences in effectiveness between vaccine types 
were also investigated with unadjusted and risk-adjusted analyses. Kaplan-Meier survival 
curves suggested that rates of death within 28 days following SARS-CoV-2 infection were 
lower after vaccination with 2 doses ofV AXZEVRIA versus those receiving COMIRNATY. 
Recipients who had been vaccinated with 2 doses of the V AXZEVRIA vaccine had a hazard 
ratio (95% CI) for death of 0.69 (0.52-0.92), indicating a 3 1  % reduction in risk of death 
compared with unvaccinated recipients. 
In Israel, a 2-dose program in the general population, with a 3-wk gap between doses using 
the CO MIRNA TY vaccine, was associated with 95% and 96% reduction in risk of infection 
and death, respectively, during an Alpha variant-dominant period. In the United Kingdom, a 
2-dose program with a 12-week gap between doses, predominantly with V AXZEVRIA or 
CO MIRNA TY vaccines, was reported as showing 79% reduction in risk of infection during 
the Alpha-dominant and 67% risk reduction during the Delta variant-dominant periods,28 
with the extended dosing schedule associated with superior VE. 
AZ comment: The author concluded that vaccination reduce risk of death from COVID-1 9  
compared with unvaccinated SOT recipients, though the level o f  vaccine enabled protection in 
SOT recipients is markedly less than that observed in the general population.

the second dose of vaccine, measurements repeated at regular intervals until week + 6-8 after 
the completion ofvaccination (77% 7%) received COMIRNATY and 8% VAXZEVRIA). 
Patients with no measurable antibodies 8 weeks after completion of the vaccination were 
considered as no responders. Overall, the two vaccine doses were well tolerated, with only 5% 
of patients developing are activation of GvHD. No relevant grade 3 or 4 organ toxicities were 
observed Overall, 66% of patients in cohort showed a humoral response. The incidence of 
positive serology was lower in patients who underwent the vaccination within the first 1 8  
months after allo-SCT (29% vs 8 3  % for patients > 1 8  months after allo-SCT, p< 0). 
AZ comment: The author suggested that a humoral response can be achieved, especially for 
those patients who are in the long-term follow-up, underwent immune reconstitution and are 
free from immunosuppression. More studies are required to assess the immune response in 
immunocompromised state. AstraZeneca is monitoring the safety profile of V AXZEVRIA in 
immunocompromised individuals. 
Benedict Osei-Boadu et al 2022 performed an audit on 352 patients from routine clinics which 
included diagnosis, type of vaccine, number of doses, side effects of the vaccines and flare up 
of arthritis or underlying autoimmune condition, to check the uptake and side effects of the 
COMIRNATY and V AXZEVRIA.  146 patients experienced mild side effects based on CTAE 
v5.0 criteria. Only 3 patients (2. 1  %) had severe side effects Grade 3 or above, this included 
Pulmonary embolism, Stroke, and symptomatic pleural effusion. 1 5(10%) reported Arthritis 
flare. Most common side effects were Headache 50(34%), Fatigue 32(22%, Myalgia 32(22%), 
Fever 30(21 % ), Chills 30(21 % ), Injection site pain 28(19% ), Rhinorrhoea 1 1  (7 .5% ), Lethargy 
1 1  (7 .5%) and maculopapular rash 5(3.4% ). The audit suggested that both V AXZEVRIA and 
COMIRNATY are safe for use in immune-deficient patients. 
AZ comment: The result suggested that both the V AXZEVRIA and COMIRNATY are safe 
for use in immune-deficient patients. The adverse events are in line with that observed for 
V AXZEVRIA in AstraZeneca Safety database. More studies focusing on different vaccines, 
non-humoral immune responses, and risk-benefit analyses are warranted. 
Whitaker et al 2022, conducted a cohort study to estimate vaccine antibody response and 
vaccine effectiveness against medically attended COVID-1 9  amongst individuals in clinical 
risk groups using cohort and test-negative case control designs. Reduced vaccine effectiveness 
against clinical disease was noted in the immunosuppressed group; after a second dose, 
effectiveness was moderate (Pfizer: 59.6%, 95%CI 1 8.0-80. 1  %; V AXZEVRIA 60.0%, 
95%CI -63.6--90.2%). 
AZ comment: The authors concluded that reduced antibody response and vaccine 
effectiveness were seen after 1 dose of vaccine amongst a broad immunosuppressed group,

and after second dose vaccine effectiveness was moderate. More studies are needed to 
understand vaccine effectiveness against severe disease amongst immunosuppressed groups, 
including the added value of 3rd and 4th doses. 
Summary 
Of the 14928 cases cumulatively and 936 for the reporting period, of subjects with severe 
immunodeficiency and in immunocompromised patient's reported globally and included in 
AstraZeneca's post-marketing database. Cases were assessed by age, sex, type of event, and 
outcome. 
Cumulatively 120 cases had a fatal outcome, (22 were reported in interval period) and 1 109 
were hospitalised. There were 249 COVID-1 9  reports cumulatively, however many did not 
have sufficient information for complete assessment. 
The review and analysis of the available literature did not highlight any particular safety 
concerns with V AXZEVRIA when used in immunocompromised patients. There were no 
articles identified with a specific reference to any new safety concerns associated with 
VAXZEVRIA. 
The authors concluded that vaccination reduce risk of death from COVID-1 9  compared with 
unvaccinated SOT recipients, though the level of vaccine enabled protection in SOT recipients 
is markedly less than that observed in the general population. 
No usual trends or clusters were identified. 
In summary, the review of available data from spontaneous reports regarding subjects with 
severe immunodeficiency and in immunocompromised patient's did not identify an index case 
or other evidence of a new or emerging signal. 
Conclusion 
This cumulative and periodic review of the Use ofV AXZEVRIA in subjects with severe 
immunodeficiency/Use in immunocompromised patients did not indicate any new safety 
concerns. Overall, the review of the currently available data did not reveal any new safety 
information in immune-compromised individuals that has not been identified in the overall 
population. 
Use of V AXZEVRIA in subjects with severe immunodeficiency/Use in immunocompromised 
patients will be investigated primarily in the ongoing non-interventional post-marketing 
observational study using existing secondary health data sources (D8 1 1  0R00002 [US] and 
D8 1 1 1R00006 [EU/UK]) study of subgroups exposed to AZD1222. Refer to Appendix 4 for

AstraZeneca will continue to monitor safety information in vaccinees with severe 
immunodeficiency and in immunocompromised patients as part of the routine safety 
surveillance activities for V AXZEVRIA and take further actions as deemed appropriate. 
Additional information regarding the Use of V AXZEVRIA in immuno-compromised 
individuals is provided in Section 1 6.4.3.2. 
16.3.5.3  Use of AZD1222 in subjects with severe and/or uncontrolled underlying 
disease/ Use in frail patients with co-morbidities (eg, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease [COPD], diabetes, chronic neurological disease, 
cardiovascular disorder) 
Subjects with severe and/or uncontrolled underlying diseases are potentially at risk of 
developing a more severe manifestation of COVID-1 9  and, as a consequence, have been 
included as a priority group for initial vaccination in several jurisdictions. Although there is no 
evidence that the safety profile of V AXZEVRIA in this population will be different to that of 
the general population, given the paucity of data, the possibility cannot be excluded. 
Indicators of frailty used in the review of cases were defined in the protocol for the 
V AXZEVRIA PASS: A post-authorisation/post-marketing observational study to evaluate the 
association between exposure to V AXZEVRIA and safety concerns using existing secondary 
health data sources. This protocol was approved by EMA on 27 January 2022, As no follow­
up questionnaires are sent for this missing information concept, no scale of frailty was used 
for the assessment of the spontaneous cases. Rather, a case narrative text search of 
V AXZEVRIA reports in the AstraZeneca global safety database using the parameters for each 
indicator of frailty in Table 212 was used to identify cases for review in the sub-sections 
below:

Conclusion 
This review of the cumulative and periodic data in individuals with frailty, severe and/or 
uncontrolled underlying disease and comorbidities did not revile any new safety concern. 
There was no increase in events seriousness ( for all discussed topics) or severity. In the 
subjects with supplemental oxygen use there was 2 fold increase in the number of the fatal 
cases reported in (5.3%) (9.7%) the current interval period (77 vs. 35 respectively) as 
compared to the previous PBRER. This was due to increased severity of underlying acute or 
chronic hypoxemia causing detrimental decrease in oxygen saturation in patients with 
uncontrolled pulmonary infection, COPD, bronchitis, congestive heart failure, and Covid-19. 
Out of the 77 fatal cases reported during the reporting interval, 35 were follow-up reports. Of 
note, out of the 42 new reports received by AstraZeneca during the reporting interval, 3 1  cases 
had the onset date at an earlier point during 2021 before the start of the reporting interval, 
however, were not reported to AstraZeneca until later. Therefore, this increase could possibly 
be explained by reporting backlog for some markets. 
In summary, no abnormal trends or significant new safety concerns were identified in the 
interval period with respect to the cumulative data. Majority of the adverse events reported in 
patients with frailty and/or uncontrolled underlying disease were either related or heavily

confounded by patients' medical history and underlying disorders or were consistent with the 
known safety profile of the vaccine. 
This cumulative and periodic review of currently available data from the use of V AXZEVRIA 
in subjects with frailty, severe and/or uncontrolled underlying diseases and comorbidities did 
not identify any new safety concerns. 
This topic will continue to be considered missing information and will be kept under close 
surveillance by AstraZeneca. 
Use ofV AXZEVRIA in subjects with severe or uncontrolled underlying disease/Use in frail 
patients will be investigated primarily in the ongoing non-interventional post-marketing 
observational study using existing secondary health data sources (D8 1 1 1 1  0R00002 [US] and 
D81 l 1R00006 [EU/UK]) study of subgroups exposed to V AXZEVRIA. Refer to Appendix 4 
for additional details. 
More detailed information is provided in Section 1 6.4.3.3. 
16.3.5.4  Use of AZD1222 with other vaccines 
The safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy ofV AXZEVRIA when co-administered with other 
vaccines has not been evaluated in clinical trials. Therefore, while there is currently no 
evidence to suggest the safety profile of the subjects receiving V AXZEVRIA when co­
administered with other vaccines would be impacted, given the paucity of data, the possibility 
cannot be excluded. 
A cumulative search of the AstraZeneca Global Safety Database through 28 June 2022 was 
undertaken to review AEs reported after vaccination with V AXZEVRIA with other non­
COVID-1 9  vaccines, including seasonal influenza vaccine, herpes vaccine, varicella vaccine, 
and pneumococcal pneumonia vaccine. Reports were identified in the Global Safety Database 
through a search of the concomitant medications for: seasonal Influenza vaccine, Herpes 
vaccines, Pneumococcal vaccine and V aricella vaccine.

unknown dates, she experienced Thrombosis, Pulmonary embolism, and Chills. On 20-Nov-
202 1 ,  she died from the events of Thrombosis, Pulmonary embolism, COVID-19, Chills, 
Feeling hot, and Abdominal pain. An autopsy was performed. The cause of death was 
pulmonary embolism (confirmed at autopsy), deep vein thrombosis (confirmed at autopsy) 
and covid-1 9  (confirmed at autopsy). No additional information was reported. 
AZ Comment: Fatal events of Thrombosis, Pulmonary embolism, COVID-19, Chills, Feeling 
hot and Abdominal pain are not listed in the company core data sheet of AZD1222. Cause of 
death is reported as Pulmonary embolism, Deep Vein Thrombosis and COVID-1 9. Current 
pandemic situation of COVID-1 9  and vaccinee' s obesity status could be considered as a 
contributory risk factor for COVID-1 9  while the age of the patient could be considered as 
contributory to the fatality of Thrombosis, Pulmonary embolism and COVID-1 9. The surgical 
history and the medical history of obesity could be considered as confounding factors for 
Pulmonary Embolism and Thrombosis. Due to limited information on the baseline health 
characteristics of the patient before vaccination, circumstances leading to the events, family 
history of the patient, possible risk factors, and clinical course of COVID-19, the evaluation 
did not find evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the events and V AXZEVRIA.

Hypertension. Due to limited information on date of vaccination, onset date of events, risk 
factors (viral infection, surgery, trauma), circumstances surrounding the events, concurrent 
conditions, concomitant medications, therapeutic measures taken with respect to the events, 
relevant medical history, detailed etiological and diagnostic work-up ( complete blood 
analysis, physical examination, neurological workup, radiological investigations including 
imaging studies, autopsy report with confirmed final diagnosis) the evaluation did not find 
evidence to suggest a causal relationship between the events and V AXZEVRIA.

Discussion 
The most common adverse events reported of V AXZEVRIA when co-administered with other 
vaccines were similar to V AXZEVRIA when given alone. In most cases, there was limited 
information. There were no additional reports received regarding Use of V AXZEVRIA with 
other vaccines. 
Conclusion 
This cumulative and periodic review of the Use of V AXZEVRIA with other vaccines did not 
indicate any new safety concerns. 
Use of V AXZEVRIA with other vaccines will continue to be considered missing information 
for V AXZEVRIA. Use of V AXZEVRIA with other vaccines will be investigated primarily in 
the ongoing non-interventional post-marketing observational study using existing secondary 
health data sources (D8 1 1 1 10R00002 [US] and D8 1 1 1R00006 [EU/UK])  study of subgroups 
exposed to V AXZEVRIA. Refer to Appendix 4 for additional details.

Summary 
There were no reports of thrombosis concurrent with 
thrombocytopenia in the V AXZEVRIA clinical development 
programme. Very rare events of serious thrombosis concurrent 
with thrombocytopenia (including fatal events), have been 
observed following vaccination with V AXZEVRIA during post-
authorisation use. 
The majority of the events occurred within the first 21 days 
following vaccination and some events had a fatal outcome. The 
reporting rates after the second dose are lower compared to after 
the first dose. 
The exact mechanism of thrombosis concurrent with 
thrombocytopenia following immunisation with V AXZEVRIA is 
unknown. Several hypothetical biologic mechanisms have been 
proposed to explain the pathophysiology ofthromboembolic 
events with thrombocytopenia following vaccination (Greinacher 
et al 2021 (NEJM)). Among them a study by Baker et al 2021, 
proposes an interaction between the ChAdOx 1 vaccine vector 
used in V AXZEVRIA and PF4; however, it is unknown if the 
adenoviral ChAdOxl interaction with PF4 is actually platelet 
activating or thrombogenic (causal of blood clots). Greinacher et 
al 2021 (NEJM) suggested that ChAdOxl itself or proteins 
contained within the vaccine can bind to PF4 to form immune 
complexes which may drive a B-cell response causing high-titer 
anti-PF4 antibodies resulting in TTS. However, none of these 
hypotheses have been confirmed. 
There are no known risk factors for the development of 
thrombosis with thrombocytopenia following vaccination.

Summary 
Prevention of thrombosis concurrent with thrombocytopenia in 
the context of COVID-19 vaccination is currently unknown. As 
described in Section 4.4 of the CDS, HCPs should be alert to the 
signs and symptoms of thromboembolism and thrombocytopenia, 
as well as coagulopathies. Vaccinated individuals should be 
instructed to seek immediate medical attention if they develop 
symptoms such as a severe or persistent headaches, blurred vision, 
confusion, seizures, shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling, 
leg pain, persistent abdominal pain, or unusual skin bruising 
and/or petechia a few days after vaccination. 
Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia is a potentially life-
threatening event if not recognised or managed appropriately, may 
result in persistent or significant disability or incapacity. 
Thrombosis with thrombocytopenia requires immediate medical 
intervention. 
The public health benefit of vaccination is considered to outweigh 
the very rare occurrence of these events. 
16.4.2 
The following 3 safety concerns are considered as important potential risks: 
Important potential risks

Immune-mediated neurological conditions (Section 1 6.4.2.1 ). 
•  Vaccine-associated enhanced disease (V AED) (Section 1 6.4.2.2).

Summary 
Overall, in clinical studies there were no clinically meaningful 
imbalances in the incidence of neurological AESis. In the US 
study, neurologic or neuroinflammatory AESis were reported in 
0.6% (121/21,587 participants) in the VAXZEVRIA (formerly 
AZD1222) group and 0.4% (48/10,792 participants) in the 
placebo group. In the pooled Oxford studies as of 
07 December 2020, neurologic or neuroinflammatory AESis 
were reported in 0.7% (81/12,282 participants) in the 
V AXZEVRIA (formerly AZD1222) group and 0.8% 
(90/1 1,963 participants) in the control group. 
Furthermore, in the pooled Oxford studies no clinically 
meaningful imbalance was noted in the incidence of AESis of 
neuroinflammatory disorders, which were reported in 7 
participants (0. 1 %) in the V AXZEVRIA (formerly AZD1222) 
group and 4 participants ( < 0. 1 % ) in the control group in the 
pooled safety dataset (any dose group). Of these, the most 
frequently reported events were nonserious AEs of facial 
paralysis occurred in 4 participants in the V AXZEVRIA 
(formerly AZD1222) group and 3 participants in the control 
group. In the US study, there were 5 nonserious AEs of facial 
paralysis, all in the V AXZEVRIA (formerly AZD1222) group. 
In the US study, there was 1 SAE of a demyelinating event: a 
participant in the V AXZEVRIA (formerly AZD1222) group 
had an AE initially reported as Guillain-Barre syndrome, which 
was subsequently diagnosed as an SAE of Chronic 
inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy. In the 
pooled Oxford studies, there were 3 SAEs of demyelinating 
events: 2 cases in the V AXZEVRIA (formerly AZD1222) 
group (1  case of transverse myelitis, and 1 case of multiple 
sclerosis in a participant with pre-existing, but previously 
unrecognised, multiple sclerosis), and 1 case of myelitis in the 
control group. 
Several hypothetical biologic mechanisms have been proposed 
to explain the pathophysiology ofneurologic adverse reactions 
following immunisation; most involve the concept of 
autoimmunity and the possibility that the vaccine's 
immunostimulatory effect results in an aberrant immunologic 
response (Stratton et al 1994). 
There are no known risk factors for the development of 
immune-mediated neurological conditions following 
vaccination. 
Prevention of immune-mediated neurological conditions in the 
context of SARS-COV-2 vaccination is unknown.

Immune-mediated neurological disorders are very rare, and as 
such the public health benefit of vaccination is considered to 
outweigh the very rare potential occurrences of such events.

terms related to COVID-19
among V AXZEVRIA (formerly AZD 1222) recipients. In the 
US study, COVID-related AESis were reported in 1.7% 
(374/21,587 participants) in the V AXZEVRIA (formerly 
AZD1222) group and 3.4% (362/10,792 participants) in the 
placebo group. In the pooled Oxford studies as of 
07 December 2020, COVID-related AESis were reported in 
0. 1 % (15/12,282 participants) in the V AXZEVRIA (formerly 
AZD1222) group and 0.3% (36/1 1 ,963 participants) in the 
control group. There have been no confirmed post-marketing 
reports ofVAED. 
The pathogenesis of V AED in the context of SARS-Co V-2 is 
unclear, and there are no consistent mechanisms or immune 
markers of disease enhancement from nonclinical studies 
(Haynes et al 2020). 
Risk groups or risk factors 
There are no known risk factors identified for V AED. 
Preventability 
Prevention of V AED in the context of SARS-COV-2 is 
currently unknown.

Summary 
There were no reports of CYST identified in the V AXZEVRIA 
(formerly AZD1222) group in the US study (D8 1 10C00001 
[DCO:  15 March 2021] and D81 1 1C00002 [DCO: 
10 January 2021]), and in the pooled Oxford studies (COV00l ,  
COV002, COV003 and COV005; DCO: 07 December 2020). In 
the post-marketing setting, CYST without thrombocytopenia 
have been reported very rarely following vaccination with 
VAXZEVRIA. 
The exact mechanism of CYST without thrombocytopenia 
following administration with V AXZEVRIA is unknown. 
There are no known risk factors for the development of CYST 
without thrombocytopenia following vaccination. 
Prevention of CYST without thrombocytopenia in the context 
of COVID-19 vaccination is currently unknown. The events of 
CYST without thrombocytopenia can be fatal and may require 
different treatment approaches than thrombosis in combination 
with thrombocytopenia. 
CYST without thrombocytopenia is a potentially life-
threatening event, and if not recognised or managed 
appropriately, may result in persistent or significant disability 
or incapacity, and hence requires immediate medical 
intervention.

16.4.3  Missing information 
The following 4 safety concerns are considered as missing information: 
•  Use of V AXZEVRIA in pregnant and breastfeeding women (Section 1 6.4.3 .1) 
•  Use ofV AXZEVRIA in subjects with severe immunodeficiency (Section 1 6.4.3.2) 
•  Use ofV AXZEVRIA in subjects with severe and/or uncontrolled underlying disease 
(Section 1 6.4.3 .3) 
•  Use ofV AXZEVRIA with other vaccines (Section 1 6.4.3.4) 
16.4.3.1  Use of V AXZEVRIA in pregnant and breastfeeding women 
Evidence source 
As per the V AXZEVRIA CDS Section 4.6, data from more than 400 case reports of pregnant 
women or women who became pregnant after receiving V AXZEVRIA do not suggest unusual 
patterns of pregnancy complications or foetal/neonatal outcomes. No increased risk of 
maternal thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia has been observed. Preliminary 
non-clinical safety studies have not indicated any concern to date, and available non-clinical, 
clinical and post-marketing data do not suggest a risk to breastfed newborns/infants. As 
V AXZEVRIA is intended for use in mass vaccination campaigns in a large proportion of the 
global population, the collection of pregnancy and infant outcomes data with the aim of 
further characterising the safety profile in this population, is still considered necessary. 
Population in need of further characterisation 
Although there are data in the post-marketing setting in pregnant and breastfeeding women, 
use of V AXZEVRIA in pregnant and breastfeeding women will continue to be investigated in 
the ongoing PASS (EAS, a post-marketing observational study using existing secondary 
health data sources, and a pregnancy registry). 
16.4.3.2  Use of V AXZEVRIA in subjects with severe immunodeficiency 
Evidence source 
Vaccines may be less effective in severely immunocompromised subjects, as the vaccinees 
weakened immune system may not mount a sufficient response; however, 
immunocompromised individuals may also be at greater risk of morbidity and mortality from

vaccine-preventable disease, and consequently this population have been identified as a 
priority group for initial vaccination in several jurisdictions following vaccine availability. 
Although there is no evidence that the safety profile of this population receiving 
V AXZEVRIA will be different to that of the general population, given the paucity of data, the 
possibility cannot be excluded. 
Population in need of further characterisation 
Use of V AXZEVRIA in subjects with severe immunodeficiency will continue to be 
investigated in the planned PASS (EAS and a post-marketing observational study using 
existing secondary health data sources, a post-marketing safety study in patients receiving 
immunosuppressant medication or with primary immunodeficiency, and an interventional 
study in immunocompromised subjects) and in ongoing clinical study COV005). 
16.4.3.3  Use of V AXZEVRIA in subjects with severe and/or uncontrolled underlying 
disease 
Evidence source 
Subjects with severe and/or uncontrolled underlying disease are potentially at risk of 
developing a more severe manifestation of COVID-1 9, and as a consequence have been 
included as a priority group for initial vaccination in several jurisdictions following vaccine 
availability. Although there is no evidence that the safety profile of this population receiving 
V AXZEVRIA will be different to that of the general population, given the paucity of data, the 
possibility cannot be excluded. 
Population in need of further characterisation 
Use ofV AXZEVRIA in patients with severe and/or uncontrolled disease will continue to be 
investigated in the planned PASS (EAS and a post-marketing observational study using 
existing secondary health data sources). 
16.4.3.4  Use of V AXZEVRIA with other vaccines 
Evidence source 
There is currently limited information regarding the safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy of 
V AXZEVRIA when co-administered with other vaccines ( eg, concurrently with seasonal 
illness vaccines). While there is currently no evidence to suggest the safety profile or efficacy 
of V AXZEVRIA when co-administered with other vaccines would be impacted, given the 
paucity of data, the possibility of an interaction causing an altered safety profile or reduced 
efficacy of either V AXZEVRIA or the co-administered vaccine cannot be excluded. 
Population in need of further characterisation 
The co-administration ofV AXZEVRIA with other vaccines (either together, or 30 days before 
or after administration) will continue to be investigated in the planned PASS (a 
post-marketing observational study using existing secondary health data sources).

Important baseline efficacy/effectiveness information 
17.1 
At the beginning of the reporting period, V AXZEVRIA was authorised for "active 
immunisation of individuals > 1 8  years old for the prevention of COVID-19". 
A summary of the information supporting the efficacy and effectiveness ofV AXZEVRIA in 
this approved indication is provided in the sub-section below. 
17.1.1 
Active immunisation of individuals �18 years old for the prevention of 
COVID-19 
The efficacy and immunogenicity of a two-dose regimen of V AXZEVRIA is being 
investigated in 1 1  ongoing clinical trials ( as presented in Section 7), with initial VE against 
symptomatic disease being demonstrated from a pooled analysis across four trials (COV00l ,  
COV002, COV003, COV005) as well as a Phase III study in the USA, Peru and Chile 
(D8 1 10C00001). The vaccine has also shown to be highly immunogenic after a single dose, 
with increase in seroconversion after a second dose. Moreover, adults (including those over 
the age of 65 years) with pre-existing comorbidity showed similar VE and immune responses 
when compared to the general population. 
Therefore, V AXZEVRIA is able to elicit a strong immune response capable of preventing 
serious symptomatic infections with SARS-COV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, a life­
threatening disease, particularly in older age groups. V AXZEVRIA has been shown to be 
efficacious in preventing severe disease, avoiding hospitalization and death. 
Emerging data suggest that waning protection in the months following a 2-dose primary series 
is contributing to the incidence of breakthrough infection. 
Data supporting an AZD1222 booster dose option are supported by analysis of the University 
of Oxford-sponsored COV00l  study as reported by Flaxman et al 202 1 .  In participants 
previously vaccinated with a 2-dose course of AZD1222, data reported by Flaxman et al 2021 
indicate that a third dose booster of AZD1222 administered 28 or more weeks after a second 
dose induces high levels of antibodies and boosts T-cell responses. Data from the COV­
BOOST trial (Munro et al 2021) indicate that booster doses of COVID-1 9  vaccines are 
generally well tolerated and provide a substantial increase in vaccine-induced immune 
responses. The authors concluded that all vaccines studied boosted antibody and neutralising 
responses after an initial course of AZD1222/AZD1222, with no safety concerns, and that the

substantial differences in hum.oral and cellular responses in combination with vaccine 
availability will influence policy choices for booster vaccination. In addition, heterologous 
boosting with AZD1222 on top of an initial course of an mRNA vaccine COMIRNATY) 
showed similar results as after an initial course of AZD1222/AZD1222 followed by a booster, 
with no safety concerns. 
On 26 November 2021 ,  the WHO designated the Omicron variant (B. 1 . 1 .529) a variant of 
concern (Tracking SARS-CoV-2 variants). Researchers at the University of Oxford have 
issued a preprint regarding the neutralisation of Omicron by large panel of sera, including 
from convalescent patients and from vaccinees receiving 2 or 3 doses of V AXZEVRIA or 
COMIRNATY vaccine (Dejnirattisai et al 2021). 
AstraZeneca has also collaborated with the University of Oxford researchers who conducted 
these assessments and with the UKHSA (formerly called Public Health England) to analyse 
sera from participants in ongoing AstraZeneca-sponsored study D7220C00001 who had 
received 3 doses of AZD1222. 
Collectively, these preliminary live virus neutralisation data suggest that 2-dose primary series 
immunisation with AZD1222 will likely provide limited protection against infection with the 
Omicron variant. These data also suggest that adding a third booster dose of AZD1222 will 
likely provide increased protection against infection with the Omicron variant, though still less 
protection than as against the original Wuhan-Hu-I  strain or other variants of concern.

New information on the efficacy of V AXZEVRIA for the approved indication of the 
prevention of COVID-1 9  in adults became available from a 6-months follow up data obtained 
from study D8 1 1  0C0000 1 .  
Since the last PBRER, data analysis from a third database lock (DCO3) occurring in 
September 202 1 became available for the ongoing study D81 1 0C0000 1 .  These data included a 
6-month data follow up after cut-off on 30 July 202 1 .  The majority of participants (90.3% in 
the AZD122 group and 89.8% in the placebo group) had been unblinded at the time of the

data cut-off date of 30 July 202 1 and the median follow-up time post second dose for the full 
data set (FVS) over the double-blind period was 78.0 days for the AZD1222 group and 7 1 .0 
days for the placebo group. 
Participants were allowed to request unblinding and receive non study COVID-1 9  vaccines as 
these became available to them. For the primary efficacy endpoint in the double-blind period 
(141 and 1 84 events; incidence rates: 39.2 and 1 1 8.8 per 1 ,000-person-years, median follow­
up from second dose 78 (AZD1222) and 7 1  days (placebo)), vaccine efficacy was 67.0% (P < 
0.001). In the period to non-study COVID-1 9  vaccination, incidence of events remained 
consistently low and stable through 6 months in the AZD1222 group; for the primary efficacy 
endpoint (328 and 219 events; incidence rates: 36.4, 108.4, median follow-up 201 and 82 
days) and severe/critical disease (5 and 13 events; incidence rates: 0.6, 6.4), respective vaccine 
efficacy estimates were 65. 1  % and 92. 1 %. AZD1222 elicited humoral immune responses over 
time, with waning observed at day 1 80 and demonstrated durable protection. 
D8111 C00002 
17.2.2 
During the reporting period one trial was completed (Study D8 1 1 1  C00002), which assessed 
the safety and immunogenicity of V AXZEVRIA in 256 participants in Japan across all age 
groups. In the AZD1222 group, antibody titers for the S and RBD antigens and for the nAb 
(pseudoneutralization) to SARS-Co V-2 increased substantially after the first dose of study 
intervention, increasing further after the second dose. After one year of follow up, it was 
observed that humoral responses against SARS-Co V-2 waned over time from previously 
reported peak responses post-second dose. At Day 365, anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike-binding and 
receptor-binding domain mean antibody titers remained above Day 1 5  levels across all ages. 
Neutralizing antibody titers declined and were below detection levels in many participants by 
Day 365. 
Homologous and Heterologous Third dose booster 
17.2.3 
During the reporting period, further evidence of immunogenicity of AZD1222 evaluating a 
homologous and/or heterologous third-dose booster of AZD1222 were identified in 
AstraZeneca-sponsored study D7220C00001 (Clinical Study Report (CSR) provided in 
Appendix B), COY-BOOST (Xinxue Liu et al. 2022), RHH-001 study (Clemens et al 2022), 
and two other observational type studies (Jara et al 2022, Munoz-Valle et al 2022). A 
summary of these studies is provided below, with conclusions on how they support use of a 
heterologous booster dose of AZD1222 after a primary course of other authorised COVID-1 9  
vaccines. 
D7220C00001 evaluated AZD1222 as a homologous booster and as a heterologous booster 
after a primary 2-dose series of an mRNA vaccine. The humoral immune response to a 
booster dose of AZD1222 in participants previously vaccinated with either AZD1222 or an 
mRNA vaccine was non-inferior to the response elicited by primary vaccination with

AZD1222 (AZD1222 cohort GMT ratio: 1 .03 [95% CI: 0.92 to 1 . 15]; mRNA cohort GMT 
ratio: 3 .08 [95% CI: 2.78 to 3.41]). 
Xinxue Liu et al. 2022 evaluated the persistence of immunogenicity after seven COVID-1 9  
vaccines given as third dose boosters following two doses ofV AXZEVRIA or COMIRNATY 
in the UK over the course of 3 months. 
The authors reported that 84 days after a third dose of COVID-1 9  vaccine there were 
substantial differences in the decay rates ofhumoral response across the vaccines. Whilst 
ChAd and Ad26 arms had significantly lower anti-spike IgG than BNT at D28 with adjusted 
GMR of 0.62 (95%CI: 0.5 1 ,  0.76) and 0.72 (95%CI: 0.61 ,  0.85), this was no longer the case at 
D84 with adjusted GMR increasing to 0.95 (95%CI: 0.78, 1 . 15) and 1 .20 (95%CI: 1 .0 1 , 1 .43), 
respectively. 
One of the conclusions reached was that the anti-spike IgG in adenoviral vector vaccine arms 
(ChAd and Ad26) after the BNT/BNT prime showed the most persistent schedules up to D84. 
The immunogenicity at D84 post boost for ChAd and Ad26 was similar to, or higher than, the 
three dose BNT schedule (BNT/BNT/BNT), especially in older people. 
RHH-001  (Clemens et al 2022), evaluated AZD1222 as a heterologous booster after a 2-dose 
primary series of the inactivated whole-virion adjuvanted vaccine CoronaVac. This study also 
evaluated COMIRNATY and JCOVDEN compared to a third dose homologous booster of 
CoronaVac. After 28 days, all heterologous boosting elicited a significantly superior response 
(p<0.0001) in anti-Spike IgG concentration and pseudoneutralising titres compared to 
homologous boosting with CoronaVac. The AZD1222 boost elicited a 90- fold rise in the anti­
spike IgG from baseline versus a 12.4 -fold rise in the homologous booster dosing. All 
heterologous booster regimens induced high concentrations of pseudovirus nAbs. At Day 28, 
all groups except for the homologous boost in the older adults reached 100% seropositivity: 
geometric mean ratios (heterologous vs homologous) were 8.7 (95% CI: 5.9 to 12.9) for 
JCOVDEN, 2 1 .5 (95% CI: 14.5 to 3 1 .9) for COMIRNATY, and 10.6 (95% CI: 7.2 to 1 5.6) 
for AZD1222. Live virus nAbs were also boosted against the Delta (B. 1 .617.2) and Omicron 
variants (B. 1 . 1 .529). These data provide supportive evidence of AZD1222's immunogenicity 
and safety profile when used as a heterologous booster. 
Jara et al 2022 also evaluated the vaccine effectiveness of AZD1222 as a heterologous booster 
after a 2-dose primary series of Corona Vac. This study was a large prospective national cohort 
sample following campaign immunization with CoronaVac in Chile, and assessed the 
effectiveness of a third dose of either Corona Vac,  COMIRNATY or AZD 1222. Heterologous 
boosting with AZD1222, following a two-dose CoronaVac primary vaccination series, yielded 
vaccine effectiveness of 97· 7% (95% CI: 97·3-98·0) against COVID-19-related 
hospitalisation, 98·9% (95% CI: 98·5%-99·2%) against ICU admission, and 98· 1 % (95% CI:

97 ·3- 98·6) against death. These data provide further supportive evidence on the high level of 
protection conferred by AZD1222 when used as a heterologous booster. 
Munoz-Valle et al 2022 evaluated AZD 1222 as a heterologous booster after primary 
immunisation with the adenoviral vector vaccine Convidecia (CanSino Biologics Inc, China). 
This descriptive study involved 62 participants from a prior study of Convidecia who had 
received a heterologous booster with AZD1222, JCOVDEN, COMIRNATY, or mRNA-1 27 at 
4.5 to 5 months after single-dose primary vaccination with Convidecia. A control group of 62 
unboosted individuals was matched with the boosted group for age, gender, treatment, 
COVID-1 9  history, and baseline antibody levels 2 1  days after primary vaccination. At 
baseline, the median percentage of neutralizing antibodies was similar in booster and control 
groups (78.16% vs. 78.65%, p > 0.05), but at 6 months post-booster was significantly higher 
in the boosted group versus controls (96.41 % vs. 89.33%, p = 0.0004), with no differences 
between vaccines. There were also no differences in adverse events between booster vaccines. 
The authors concluded that a heterologous regimen of 1 dose of Convidecia followed by a 
booster dose of a different vaccine is safe and results in a robust humoral immune response. 
These data support the use of AZD1222 as a heterologous booster after a primary series of an 
adenovirus vector vaccine. 
17.2.4 
Vaccine effectiveness against dominant SARS-COV-2 variant of 
concern - Omicron 
A recent test-negative case-control study examined the VE against symptomatic disease 
caused by the Delta and Omicron variants (Andrews et al 2022). The study included a 
representative sample of the general population in England who had PCR tests performed 
when prevalence of Omicron had surpassed that of Delta variant in the UK. The data set 
included 886774 persons with symptomatic disease who were infected with the Omicron 
variant, 204154 persons infected with the Delta variant, and 1 572621 test-negative controls. 
Protection against severe COVID-1 9  or hospitalisations due to COVID-1 9  was not assessed in 
this study. No effect against the Omicron variant was observed from 20 weeks after a primary 
vaccination with AZD 1222, but the VE of a booster dose was 55 .6% at 2 to 4 weeks and 
46.7% at 5 to 9 weeks following booster administration. This decrease in VE was also noted 
with a third homologous dose of COMIRNATY, with VE decreasing from 67.2% at 2 to 4 
weeks to 45.7% after 1 0  or more weeks, and mRNA-1273, for which VE declined from 73.9% 
after 2 to 4 weeks to 64.4% after 5 to 9 weeks. 
In another real-world evidence study conducted by the United Kingdom Health Security 
Agency (Kirsebom et al 2022), a test-negative case control design was used to estimate the 
VE of an AZD1222 or COMIRNATY booster following a primary series of AZD1222 against 
symptomatic disease and hospitalisation after infection with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron 
variant in England. Protection against symptomatic disease in those aged 65 years and older 
peaked at 66. 1  % and 68.5% among those who received AZD 1222 and CO MIRNA TY

boosters, respectively, and waned to 44.5% and 54. 1% after 5 to 9 weeks. VE against 
hospitalisation after infection with the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant peaked at 82.3% after 
an AZD1222 booster and 90.9% after a COMIRNATY booster. The authors noted differences 
between the population receiving AZD1222 and the population receiving COMIRNATY, with 
those receiving 3 doses of AZD1222 more likely to be in risk groups; this was also true for 
Andrews et al 2022. While AZD1222-induced nAb concentrations were lower against the 
Omicron variant than for other variants, no correlates of protection have been established, and 
clinical effectiveness of an AZD1222 booster has been observed in real-world studies against 
COVID-1 9  due to the Omicron variant. 
Additional real world studies have demonstrated high vaccine effectiveness (VE) against the 
Omicron variant in a variety of settings and populations, particularly with regard to prevention 
of severe disease and are summarized below. 
Effectiveness of a 2-dose primary series of AZD 1222 remains high ( 61-7 1  % VE) against 
hospitalisation due to Omicron variant in individuals 65+ years of age in England who 
completed their primary series > 175 days previously (Kirsebom et al 2022, Stowe et al 
2022). 
At 7+ days after a 3rd dose AZD1222 booster on top of an AZD1222 primary series, 
effectiveness against hospitalisation due to the Omicron variant is 82% (95% CI 64-91 %). 
(Kirsebom et al 2022). 
Against symptomatic Omicron infection in Thailand, AZD 1222 given as a 1 st booster was 
shown to have 26% VE (95% CI 8-40), whilst AZD1222 as a 2nd booster offered 
significantly higher protection, with 7 1  % VE (85% CI 59-79; Chariyalertsak et al 2022) 
Effectiveness of hybrid immunity (infection plus vaccination) against infection for 
AZD1222 vaccine as pt booster peaked at 72. 1  % (95% CI: 7 1 .4-72.8%) during a period 
when Omicron was dominant in Brazil. Protection against severe illness (hospitalization 
or death) provided by a 1 st booster dose of AZD1222 peaked at 98. 1 % (95% CI: 97.7-
98.5%) during an Omicron predominant period (Cerqueira-Silva et al 2022). 
In a prison population in Zambia that included over 1 0.5% of individuals who were living 
with HIV, effectiveness of an AZD1222 primary series against infection with Omicron 
was 89.4% (95% CI: 59.5-97.8%), whilst effectiveness against symptomatic infection 
with Omicron was 85. 1 % (95% CI:  1 9.5-98.0%; Simwanza et al 2022).

injection ofrAd26-S 1  x  101 1 vp (nominal) on Day 1 followed by AZD1222 5  x  1010 vp 
(nominal) on Day 29. 
Preliminary safety data became available during the reporting period and are provided below. 
Final analyses have not been completed and will be provided at the next PBRER. 
Immunogenicity data are not available. 
Overall, AZD1222 and rAd26-S components have demonstrated an acceptable safety profile 
with no new safety concerns from combination use of vaccines (administered in either order) 
in healthy adults without known past laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, positive 
SARS-Co V-2 R T-PCR test at screening, or seropositivity to SARS-Co V-2 at screening. 
Reactogenicity, as evaluated by the incidence of solicited AEs for 7 days post each dose, 
appeared to be greater in the sequence AZD1222/rAd26-S compared with the sequence 
rAd26-S/AZD1222, particularly with respect to the incidence of Grade 3 (severe) solicited 
local and systemic AEs observed during the first few days after injection. Overall, the 
reactogenicity findings were consistent with the known and well-established safety profile of 
AZD1222. 
Characterisation of benefits 
17 .3 
The benefits ofV AXZEVRIA (AZD1222) remain essentially the same as those presented in 
the previous PBRER. During the reporting period, V AXZEVRIA received EMA approval to 
be administered intramuscularly (0.5ml) to individuals who completed the primary 
vaccination course with V AXZEVRIA or an approved mRNA COVID-1 9  vaccine and a 
minimum of 3 months have elapsed from the completion of the primary vaccination. 
The benefits of the vaccine have been demonstrated through controlled clinical studies 
conducted by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, as well as data from real world 
effectiveness studies. Analysis of efficacy across multiple clinical trials demonstrates that 
AZD1222 is effective against SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness and 
prevents the development of severe/critical cases of COVID-19, including COVID-1 9  
hospitalizations and deaths, confirming important advantages not only for the health of 
vaccine recipients, but also for the potential to reduce use of healthcare resources. 
Availability of the D8 1 10C00001 DCO3 (30 July 2021) analysis support maintenance of 
efficacy for at least 6-months (VE= 66.98% and a lower bound of the 95% CI of 58.87%.). 
Moreover, a closely similar level of efficacy is obtained across age groups. Furthermore, 
V AXZEVRIA elicited a strong humoral immune response in this study. Analysis of efficacy 
against variants demonstrated additional benefit, with an overall VE in sequenced variants 
similar to the VE of the primary analysis in study D8 1 1  0C0000 1 .

The RWE study data that became available during the reporting period provides evidence that 
the benefits of V AXZEVRIA extend to protection against the widely circulating omicron 
variant, both in the primary vaccination course and in the booster setting, particularly against 
progression to severe disease, hospitalization or death. These results are concordant with live 
virus neutralization data from exploratory analysis, conducted separately, which suggest that 
2-dose primary series immunization with V AXZEVRIA will likely provide protection against 
infection with the Variants of Concern, including Omicron, and clinically meaningful 
protection against hospitalization and severe disease would be maintained. Moreover, it is 
anticipated that V AXZEVRIA -induced T cell responses likely will be less affected than 
antibody responses. Moreover, these latest RWE data are in line with the results previously 
reported by Flaxman et al 2021 and Munro et al 2021 whereby an V AXZEVRIA booster in 
participants previously vaccinated with a primary series of V AXZEVRIA or mRNA vaccine, 
elicits strong humoral immune responses against a range of Variants of Concern. 
Thus, the benefits of V AXZEVRIA 2-dose primary vaccinations are demonstrated by the 
efficacy and immunogenicity data in AstraZeneca-sponsored studies, University of Oxford­
sponsored studies and from RWE studies, for both the primary vaccination and for the booster 
settings.

INTEGRATED BENEFIT-RISK ANALYSIS FOR APPROVED 
INDICATIONS 
The analysis of the benefit-risk balance incorporates an evaluation of the safety and 
efficacy/effectiveness information that became available during the reporting period, in the 
context of what was known previously. This evaluation involves the following: 
•  Critically examining information that has emerged during the reporting period to 
determine whether it has generated new signals, led to the identification of new potential 
or identified risks, or contributed to knowledge of previously identified risks. 
•  Critically summarising relevant new safety and efficacy/effectiveness information that 
could have an impact on the benefit-risk balance. 
•  Conducting an integrated benefit-risk analysis for all approved indication(s) based on the 
cumulative information available since the DIBD (where the DIBD is unknown or 
AstraZeneca does not have access to data from the clinical development period, the 
earliest possible applicable date is used as the starting point for inclusion and evaluation 
of the cumulative information). 
Summarising any risk minimisation actions that may have been taken or implemented 
during the reporting period, as well as risk minimisation actions that are planned to be 
implemented. 
• 
•  Outlining plans for signal or risk evaluations, including timelines and/or proposals for 
additional pharmacovigilance activities.

of individuals 
�18 years old for the prevention 
of 
COVID-19 
•  Medical need for the product 
Soon after the 201 9  report of the then unknown pneumonia occurring in clusters of patients in 
Hubei province of Wuhan, China [http://wjw.wuhan.gov.cn/front/web/ show 
Detail/201 9123 108989], the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
was identified as the causative agent of COVID-1 9  in January 2020 (Na Zhu 2020). Following 
the WHO declaration of the COVID-1 9  pandemic on 1 1  March 2020, COVID-1 9  has been 
reported in 223 Countries, devastating lives and causing economic chaos across the Globe. 
As of 12 July 2022, WHO reported that worldwide, over 550 million cases of COVID-1 9  had 
been confirmed and over 6 million people had lost their lives to COVID-1 9  (WHO 
Coronavirus (COVID-1 9) Dashboard). Airfinity estimated the impact ofV AXZEVRIA on 
lives saved to be 6.3 million based on data from Watson & Barnsley et al 2022. 
There is a medical need to also maintain and/or increase protection in vaccinated individuals 
in the face of waning immunity and emerging variants of SARS-CoV-2. For many infectious 
diseases, multiple or additional 'booster' doses beyond those prescribed by the original 
vaccination protocol are a standard part of the vaccination schedule. For example, booster 
vaccines are given for tetanus, diphtheria, and polio (NHS 2021 ). Boosters can help to elevate 
the level of antibodies and memory immune cells, and in some instances, strengthen their 
potency (Callaway 2021). 
As recommendations and regulatory authorizations for booster dosing with COVID-1 9  
vaccines continue to expand, the authorization o f  AZD1222 for booster vaccination will help 
address the demand for COVID-1 9  vaccine doses, when a substantial number of people, 
particularly in low and low-to-middle income countries, have not received or completed a 
primary vaccination series (Ritchie et al 2020). 
Later in the COVID-1 9  pandemic, viral mutations led to the emergence of more efficiently 
transmissible versions of SARS-COV-2, actively monitored by WHO and categorized as 
variants of interest or variants of concern, depending on their epidemiological characteristics 
and pathogenesis. During previous reporting (June to December 202 1 ), AstraZeneca reported 
on WHO-labelled variants of concerns, ie, Alpha (B. 1 . 1 .  7); Beta (B. 1 .351 ); Gamma (P . 1) and 
Delta (B. 1 .617.2). The epidemiological landscaped has now changed and more recently, 
further mutations in SARS-COV-2 led to the identification of more (Nyberg et al 2022)

rapidly transmissible Omicron variants of concern, now dominating transmission within 
communities worldwide (ie, Omicron BA. 1 ,  BA.2, BA.3, BA.4 and BA.5) CDC 2022. 
It has been noticed that hybrid immunity conferred by a mix of natural infection and 
immunization is not as effective against Omicron variants in comparison with the earlier 
strains of SARS-COV-2. Once infected with SARS-COV-2, the majority of individuals may 
remain asymptomatic or will experience light to mild symptoms. When severely affected, 
patients may need hospitalization to primarily treat pneumonia and acute respiratory distress 
syndrome. Systemic failure of multiple organs may ensue, leading to death. Certain 
comorbidities and older age are known to increase the risk for severe COVID-1 9  and death 
(Coopersmith et al 202 1). Recently included in the therapeutic arsenal to treat COVID-1 9  are: 
antiviral medications ( eg, molnupiravir, ritonavir in combination with nirmatrelvir, 
remdesivir), anti-SARS-CoV-2 monoclonal antibodies (eg, Evusheld (Tixagevimab and 
cilgavimab), sotrovimab), anti-inflammatory drugs (eg, dexamethasone), and 
immunomodulators agents (eg, baricitinib, tocilizumab). Although the contribution of the 
available therapeutic armamentarium towards the treatment of Covid-1 9  or prophylaxis from 
infection is significant and growing as new therapeutics are being developed, vaccines to 
prevent severe COVID-1 9  and death remain the primary agents of choice to control the 
COVID-1 9  pandemic. 
Important alternatives available 
• 
Following the WHO declaration of the COVID-1 9  pandemic on 1 1  March 20, accelerated 
vaccine development began worldwide to prevent infection with the causative agent, SARS­
COV-2. Until the end of the reporting period (28 June 2022), 344 Covid-1 9  vaccine 
candidates had either been developed or were in development. (London School of Hygiene & 
Tropical Medicine). 
Currently, five main technologies are included in approved worldwide: messenger RNA 
[ mRNA ], viral-vectored, inactivated whole virus, protein subunit, and plasmid DNA 
approaches (Nohynek and Wilder 2022). V AXZEVRIA is among vaccines that do not need 
added adjuvant to enhance immune response, unlike some whole-virus and protein subunit 
vaccines. 
Apart from V AXZEVRIA, there are 5 other vaccines are currently approved in the EU/EEA 
and UK:  Comirnaty (Pfizer), Spikevax (Modema), Nuvaxovid (Novavax), JCOVDEN 
(Janssen), and VLA2001 (Valneva).

18.2.1 
Benefit-risk analysis evaluation 
Active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 in 
individuals 18 years of age and older 
An evaluation of the benefit-risk profile for the use ofV AXZEVRIA in the authorised 
indications cited in Section 1 7 . 1  (Important baseline efficacy/ effectiveness information) is 
provided below. 
18.2.1.1  Context of use of the medicinal product 
The COVID-1 9  epidemic has caused major disruption to healthcare systems with significant 
socioeconomic impacts. Containment measures have failed to stop the spread of the virus, 
which has resulted in pandemic levels. World-wide efforts to develop effective vaccines 
against SARS-CoV-2 are ongoing. Given the extent and continued rapid pace of infection, 
severity of the pandemic's medical and socioeconomic impact, and the supply challenges 
associated with a global vaccination program, multiple vaccines are needed. V AXZEVRIA 
was developed to address this public health need. 
V AXZEVRIA primary vaccination course consists of two separate doses of 0.5 ml each. The 
second dose should be administered between 4 and 12 weeks after the first dose. It is 
recommended that individuals who receive a first dose of V AXZEVRIA complete the 
vaccination course with V AXZEVRIA. 
Emerging data suggest that waning protection in the months following a 2-dose primary series 
is contributing to the incidence of breakthrough infection. Several studies have demonstrated 
that a third dose of homologous I heterologous booster vaccinations have been safe and were 
able to elicit a humoral immune response regardless of the combination of primary series and 
booster doses. 
During the reporting period, the CDS was updated to indicate that V AXZEVRIA may be 
given as a booster dose (third dose) of0.5 ml to individuals who completed the primary 
vaccination course with V AXZEVRIA or another authorised COVID-1 9  vaccine. The third 
dose should be administered at least 3 months after completing the primary vaccination 
course. 
There have been no new data or information received during the reporting period that impacts 
the previously established efficacy and effectiveness ofV AXZEVRIA in the approved 
indication of prevention of COVID-1 9  in adults  1 8  years of age and older. 
Additionally, analysis of efficacy at the 6-month data cut-off, demonstrated that vaccine 
efficacy ofV AXZEVRIA was maintained up to 6 months post first dose. The results of the 
6-month humoral immunogenicity are still under analysis. Analysis of efficacy against 
variants demonstrated additional benefit, with an overall VE in sequenced variants similar to

the VE of the primary analysis in study D8 1 1  0C0000 1 .  Preliminary live virus neutralization 
data from exploratory analysis conducted separately suggest that a 2-dose primary series 
immunization with V AXZEVRIA will likely provide protection against infection with the 
current variant of concern, Omicron, and clinically meaningful protection against 
hospitalization and severe disease would be maintained. Moreover, it is anticipated that 
V AXZEVRIA induced T cell responses likely will be less affected than antibody responses.

With the COVID-1 9  pandemic causing a global health crisis with severe illness, 
hospitalisations, and death in many individuals, in addition to major disruption to healthcare 
systems, it is clear that multiple vaccines with a positive benefit-risk are needed. With its 
proven effect in preventing COVID-1 9  and related hospitalisations, including protection 
against current variants, V AXZEVRIA is considered appropriate to address this urgent unmet 
medical need. Moreover, the easy storage and handling of the V AXZEVRIA formulation is 
considered to be an important additional benefit that enables wide access to the vaccine. 
Real World Evidence data obtained later in the COVID-1 9  pandemic, demonstrated that, as 
with other vaccines approved to prevent COVID-19, V AXZEVRIA is able to elicit humoral 
immune response following primary series immunization with any approved COVID-1 9  
vaccine. 
In conclusion, the overall benefits ofV AXZEVRIA in the prevention of COVID-1 9  with 
robust efficacy overall, in a wide array of subgroups, including adults � 65 years of age and 
persons with at least one comorbidity at enrolment, and in the prevention of severe/critical 
COVID-1 9  illness and COVID-1 9  related emergency department (ED) visits and deaths

continue to outweigh risks from adverse events, including the very rare risk of thrombosis in 
combination with thrombocytopenia identified through post-marketing safety reports. 
18.2.1.2  Considerations relating to key benefit(s) 
During the reporting period, the benefit-risk profile ofV AXZEVRIA has been shown to be 
consistently favourable across the clinical development programme and in published real­
world evidence studies. The benefit-risk profile is favourable for the proposed indication in 
adults age 1 8  years and older, including adults age 65 years and above, as well as those with 
comorbidities. 
As described in section 17, the durability of protection against COVID-1 9  was demonstrated 
after 6 months of follow-up data obtained from study DC8 1 1 0C00001 ,  and real world 
evidence data confirmed V AXZEVRIA continues to protect vaccinated individuals against 
severe disease and death. 
Several studies have demonstrated that a third dose of V AXZEVRIA given as a homologous 
or a heterologous booster vaccination have been safe and were able to elicit humoral immune 
response regardless of the combination of primary series and booster doses. 
18.2.1.3  Considerations relating to risk 
The important identified and potential risks associated with V AXZEVRIA are characterised in 
detail in Section 1 6.4. 
Considerations regarding the key important identified and potential risks are summarised 
below: 
•  Thrombosis in combination with thrombocytopenia: A very rare and serious 
combination of thrombosis and thrombocytopenia, including thrombosis with 
thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), in some cases accompanied by bleeding, has been 
observed following vaccination with V AXZEVRIA during post-authorisation use. The 
majority of the events occurred within the first 2 1  days following vaccination and 
some events had a fatal outcome. The reporting rates after the second dose are lower 
compared to the first dose. No new or emerging concern regarding TTS has been 
identified with booster doses of AZD1222. Based on the available data, thrombosis in 
combination with thrombocytopenia is considered a very rare adverse reaction of 
V AXZEVRIA. The CDS reflects AstraZeneca's position on this risk. 
•  Immune-mediated neurological conditions: There is a theoretical concern that 
vaccination could be associated with immune-mediated neurological conditions. Very 
rare events of demyelinating disorders were reported in the V AXZEVRIA clinical 
development programme and in the post-marketing use, however, there is no evidence 
suggesting a causal relationship between V AXZEVRIA and demyelinating disorders. 
Severe neurological conditions may result in persistent or significant disability or

incapacity and require early detection, careful monitoring, and timely medical 
intervention. CDS reflects AstraZeneca's position on this risk. 
•  CVST without thrombocytopenia: Events of cerebrovascular venous and sinus 
thrombosis (CVST) without thrombocytopenia have been reported very rarely in the 
post-authorisation setting following vaccination with V AXZEVRIA. The exact 
mechanism ofCVST without thrombocytopenia following administration with 
V AXZEVRIA is unknown. There are no known risk factors for the development of 
CVST without thrombocytopenia following vaccination. Events of CVST without 
thrombocytopenia may require different treatment approaches than thrombosis in 
combination with thrombocytopenia (eg, use of heparin or warfarin). Based on the 
available data, a causal association has not been established between V AXZEVRIA 
and CVST without thrombocytopenia. However, such events are considered an 
important potential risk and CDS reflects AstraZeneca's position on this risk. 
•  Vaccine-associated enhanced disease (V AED) / Vaccine-associated enhanced 
respiratory disease (V AERD): This safety concern is currently theoretical in relation 
to V AXZEVRIA administration, and based on the available data, a causal association 
has not been established between V AXZEVRIA and V AED / V AERO. Therefore, 
there is no public health impact noted at this time. 
The significance of the information that became available during the reporting period has been 
evaluated in the context of what was known previously. An integrated evaluation of the key 
benefits and risks continue to suggest an overall positive benefit-risk profile for the use of 
V AXZEVRIA. The data gathered during the reporting period of this PBRER did not provide 
any additional evidence which would alter the efficacy or safety evaluation of V AXZEVRIA. 
Strengths, weaknesses, and uncertainties of the evidence 
18.2.1.4 
The efficacy results have been confirmed in study D81 1 0C0000 1 conducted in the US, Chile 
and Peru and from the pooled analysis of 4 Oxford University Sponsored studies (COV 001 ,  
COV002, COV003 & COV005 studies) all o f  which are randomised, controlled trials. 
AZD1222 confers a strong immunogenicity response when administered as a booster both in 
the homologous or heterologous primary series settings and considered safe for use. During 
the reporting period, this is reflected with a positive CHMP opinion received for use of 
V AXZEVRIA as a third dose booster in individuals who completed their primary vaccination 
course with V AXZEVRIA or an approved mRNA COVID 1 9  vaccine as indicated in the EU 
SmPC. 
Additional real world studies have demonstrated high vaccine effectiveness (VE) against the 
Omicron variant in a variety of settings and populations, particularly with regard to prevention 
of severe disease, please refer to section 9 . 1 .

Populations in need of further characterisation include use of V AXZEVRIA in pregnant and 
breastfeeding women, in subjects with severe immunodeficiency, in patients with severe 
and/or uncontrolled disease, and co-administration / interaction ofV AXZEVRIA with other 
vaccines. However, these patient populations will continue to be investigated in ongoing 
PASS activities. 
18.2.1.5  Methodology and reasoning used to develop the benefit-risk evaluation 
A qualitative assessment of the benefit-risk balance for the use ofV AXZEVRIA for active 
immunisation to prevent COVID-1 9  caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals >18 years of age 
has been performed. 
Conclusions on efficacy from the V AXZEVRIA (AZD1222) clinical development 
programme, in particular from pooled analysis of Studies COV00l ,  COV002, COV003, 
COV005 and the preliminary analysis of the US study (D8 1 1  0C0000 1 ), provide evidence of 
the key benefits associated with the use of V AXZEVRIA in the approved indication. Key 
benefits are those that are considered to have a substantial positive impact on the benefit-risk 
balance. 
AstraZeneca's pharmacovigilance system provides the framework for the identification of any 
risks associated with the use ofV AXZEVRIA in the approved indication. All information that 
has emerged during the reporting period has been reviewed and evaluated by AstraZeneca, 
irrespective of reporting source, seriousness, or causality. This has included an analysis of 
clinical trials, literature studies, safety topics that are kept under close surveillance, as well as 
an assessment of any new safety issues. 
The significance of the information that became available during the reporting period has been 
evaluated in the context of what was known previously. An integrated evaluation of the key 
benefits and risks give an overall positive benefit-risk profile for the use ofV AXZEVRIA 
The data gathered during the reporting period of this PBRER did not provide any additional 
evidence which would alter the efficacy or safety evaluation of V AXZEVRIA

CONCLUSIONS AND ACTIONS 
V AXZEVRIA is used for active immunisation to prevent COVID-1 9  caused by SARS-Co V-2 
in individuals > 1 8  years of age, as described in the previous sections. 
There has been no new efficacy related information received during the reporting period that 
impacts previously established efficacy and effectiveness of V AXZEVRIA in the approved 
indication. V AXZEVRIA confers a strong immunogenicity response when administered as a 
booster both in the homologous or heterologous primary series settings and considered safe 
for use. During the reporting period V AXZEVRIA was approved in EU as a third dose 
booster in individuals who completed their primary vaccination course with V AXZEVRIA or

an approved mRNA COVID 1 9  vaccine. The RWE study data that became available during 
the reporting period provides evidence that the benefits of V AXZEVRIA extend to protection 
against the widely circulating omicron variant, both in the primary vaccination course and in 
the booster setting, particularly against progression to severe disease, hospitalization or death. 
There were no new significant safety findings from any of the AstraZeneca-sponsored or 
Oxford-sponsored clinical trials with V AXZEVRIA (AZD1222) during the reporting period. 
AstraZeneca is not aware of any safety signals arising for V AXZEVRIA from any other 
studies conducted by AstraZeneca partner companies. 
During the reporting period, CDS Section 4.6 was updated to reflect the most current non­
clinical, clinical and post-authorization data regarding the use ofV AXZEVRIA during 
pregnancy and while breastfeeding. The use of the vaccine should be considered during 
pregnancy when the benefits outweigh the risks. CDS  Section 4.2 (Posology and method of 
administration) was also updated with the recommendation for use of a booster dose (third 
dose) in individuals who completed the primary vaccination course with V AXZEVRIA or 
another authorised COVID-1 9  vaccine. In addition, AstraZeneca validated the signals of 
hypoaesthesia/paraesthesia, GBS and Tinnitus. During the reporting period, the signal of 
hypoaesthesia/paraesthesia was confirmed, and the CDS Section 4.8 (Undesirable effects) was 
updated with the addition of paraesthesia and hypoaesthesia as uncommon adverse drug 
reactions. Although the signal GBS was refuted, CDS Section 4.4 (Special warnings and 
special precautions for use) the existing warning on neurological events was amended to 
include a specific reference to GBS. The signal Tinnitus was confirmed post DLP, and Section 
4.8 of the CDS was updated with the addition of Tinnitus with a frequency of uncommon. 
After the DLP, the signal cutaneous vasculitis was validated and subsequently confirmed. 
V AXZEVRIA CDS is currently in the progress to be updated to include cutaneous vasculitis 
as ADR in Section 4.8. The updated CDS will be internally approved before the due date of 
this PBRER. AstraZeneca is further reviewing the signal of immune thrombocytopenia as part 
of internal signal evaluation processes and will provide the conclusions and any recommended 
actions within the next PBRER. 
The benefit of vaccination V AXZEVRIA has been weighed against the safety experience in 
the clinical programmes as well from post-authorization use. The data received during this 
reporting period, combined with analyses of the cumulative efficacy and safety data available, 
does not indicate a change in the positive benefit-risk profile of V AXZEVRIA. It is 
AstraZeneca's opinion that the information in the current document and the CDS accurately 
reflects the known benefit-risk profile for V AXZEVRIA.

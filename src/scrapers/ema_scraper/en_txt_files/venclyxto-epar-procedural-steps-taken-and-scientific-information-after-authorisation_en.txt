SmPC and PL 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
Venclyxto in the approved indication remains favourable 
and therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

20/05/2021

SmPC, Annex 
This procedure concerns an application to update of product 
lysis syndrome (TLS) prophylaxis and management 
II and PL 
information for venetoclax related to TLS (tumor lysis 
following an update to the Company Core Data Sheet 
(CCDS), as well as amendment of the annex II.D to 
propose additional risk minimisation measures in the 
form of Patient Card implementation and Direct 
Healthcare Professional Communication (DHPC) 
distribution as result of a medical safety assessment 
conducted on TLS post-marketing reports. The 
Package leaflet and RMP (version 8) have also been 
updated, accordingly. 
The proposed changes to the SmPC include section 
4.2 and 4.4: 
• Section 4.2: A more prescriptive table which 
replaces the text around the risk assessment, 
prophylaxis and monitoring measures based on the 
level of tumor burden. In addition, the text on the 
recommended dose modifications for toxicities is 
replaced by a table format for clarity. 
• Section 4.4: the text is revised to emphasize the 
fact that TLS occur in all patients and requires 
adequate risk assessment that considers 
comorbidities, particularly renal impairment, and 
syndrome) prophylaxis and management following a 
medical safety assessment conducted by MAH on post-
marketing reports of TLS.  
The EMA scientific committees CHMP and PRAC included a 
request for additional minimisation measures and 
educational material for which a Direct Healthcare 
Professional Communication (DHPC)  with the purpose of 
informing EU prescribers of the product changes which 
encompass the totality of CLL patients treated with 
Venclyxto as well as to emphasize that adherence to TLS 
mitigation measures as per SmPC is essential in these 
patients. A patient card has also been included since the 
Package leaflet as the routine risk minimisation measure is 
not considered a sufficient tool for such serious risk and the 
available evidence of its background. 
The proposed key elements are the following: contact 
details on the prescriber and the patient, signs and 
symptoms of TLS, the need to seek immediate medical 
attention in case of their occurrence, a warning message 
for healthcare professionals treating the patient at any time 
that  
this treatment is associated with the risk of TLS

other risk factors such as splenomegaly.

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

moderate (Child-Pugh B; n=6) hepatic impairment were 
similar to subjects with normal hepatic function, after 
receiving a 50 mg single dose of venetoclax. In subjects 
with severe (Child-Pugh C; n=5) hepatic impairment, the 
mean venetoclax Cmax was similar to subjects with normal 
hepatic function but venetoclax AUCinf was on average 2.7-
fold higher (range: no change to 5-fold higher) than 
venetoclax AUCinf in the subjects with normal hepatic 
function. 
In conclusion, a dose reduction of at least 50% throughout 
treatment is recommended for patients with severe hepatic 
impairment. These patients should be monitored more 
closely for signs of toxicity.

Open-Label Study of the Efficacy of ABT199 (GDC-
0199) in Subjects with Relapsed/Refractory or 
Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia 
Harboring the 17p Deletion. 
Following the CHMP request, the MAH has updated 
SmPC section 4.8 with updated safety data from 
M13-982 and M14-032 studies. Frequency of 
following adverse reactions has been upgraded from 
common to very common: Pneumonia, Lymphopenia, 
additional activity category 3 study in the risk management 
plan (RMP), was submitted by MAH as required. The aim of 
the study was to better characterise the Safety in long-
term exposure (> 12 months) of venetoclax and second 
primary malignancy and Richter's transformation in longer 
exposure to venetoclax monotherapy. 
Study M13-982 is now fully enrolled and exposure time is 
longer compared to previously submitted data; the efficacy 
endpoints do not differ from previously reported data; the 
safety profile is consistent with previous data.

Approximately 14% of patients experienced Richter’s 
transformation and 15% reported a second primary 
malignancy. No clear pattern has been detected regarding 
the different types of second primary malignancies 
reported. A causal association between venetoclax 
administration and Richter transformation / other second 
primary malignancies cannot be ruled out based on the 
available data and the MAH is required to submit a final 
study report for M13-982. 
In addition, following the CHMP request, the MAH has 
updated SmPC section 4.8 with updated safety data from 
M13-982 and M14-032 studies. Frequency of following

Information on co-administration of azithromycin with 
venetoclax has been included in section 4.5 of SmPC, in 
healthy subjects a decrease in venetoclax Cmax and AUC∞ 
were observed. However, no dose adjustment is considered 
necessary during short-term use of azithromycin when 
administered concomitantly with venetoclax. 
In addition, the information is included on interaction 
between venetoclax with digoxin, a P-gp substrate, which 
resulted in an increase in digoxin Cmax and a AUC. The 
SmPC already includes warning that co administration of 
narrow therapeutic index P gp, or BCRP substrates with 
venetoclax should be avoided.

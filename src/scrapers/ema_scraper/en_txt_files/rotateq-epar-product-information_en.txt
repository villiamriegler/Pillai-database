CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1  Therapeutic indications
RotaTeq is indicated for the active immunisation of infants from the age of 6 weeks to 32 weeks for
prevention of gastroenteritis due to rotavirus infection (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).
RotaTeq is to be used on the basis of official recommendations.
4.2  Posology and method of administration
Posology
From birth to 6 weeks
RotaTeq is not indicated in this subset of paediatric population. 
The safety and efficacy of RotaTeq in individuals from birth to 6 weeks of age have not been
established.
From 6 weeks to 32 weeks
The vaccination course consists of three doses. 
The first dose may be administered from the age of 6 weeks and no later than the age of 12 weeks.
2
RotaTeq may be given to infants who were born prematurely provided that the period of gestation was
at least 25 weeks. These infants should receive the first dose of RotaTeq at least six weeks after birth
(see sections 4.4 and 5.1).
There should be intervals of at least 4 weeks between doses.
It is preferable that the vaccination course of three doses should be completed by the age of
20-22 weeks. If necessary, the third (last) dose may be given up to the age of 32 weeks (see section
5.1).
As no data exist regarding the interchangeability of RotaTeq with another rotavirus vaccine, it is
recommended that infants who receive RotaTeq for the first immunisation against rotavirus should
receive this same vaccine for the subsequent doses.
If it is observed or strongly suspected that an incomplete dose has been swallowed (e.g., infant spits or
regurgitates the vaccine), a single replacement dose may be given at the same vaccination visit,
however, this has not been studied in clinical trials. If the problem recurs, additional replacement
doses should not be given.
No further doses are recommended after completion of the 3-dose vaccination course (see sections 4.4
and 5.1 regarding available information on persistence of protection).
From 33 weeks to 18 years
RotaTeq is not indicated in this subset of paediatric population. 
Method of administration
RotaTeq is for oral administration only.
RotaTeq SHOULD UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BE INJECTED.
RotaTeq may be given without regard to food, liquid, or breast milk.
See section 6.6 for administration instructions.
4.3  Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
Hypersensitivity after previous administration of rotavirus vaccines.
Previous history of intussusception.
Subjects with congenital malformation of the gastrointestinal tract that could predispose to
intussusception.
Infants who have known or suspected immunodeficiency (see sections 4.4 and 4.8).
Administration of RotaTeq should be postponed in infants suffering from acute severe febrile illness.
The presence of a minor infection is not a contraindication for immunisation.
The administration of RotaTeq should be postponed in subjects suffering from acute diarrhoea or
vomiting.
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability 
3
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
As with all vaccines, appropriate medical treatment should always be readily available in case of an
anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine (see section 4.8).
No safety or efficacy data are available from clinical trials regarding administration of RotaTeq to
immunocompromised infants, those exposed in utero to an immunosuppressive treatment, infants
infected with HIV or infants who have received a blood transfusion or immunoglobulins within
42 days of dosing. Asymptomatic HIV infection is not expected to affect the safety or efficacy of
RotaTeq. However, in the absence of sufficient data, administration of RotaTeq to asymptomatic HIV-
infected infants is not recommended. Administration of RotaTeq to infants who have been exposed in
utero to an immunosuppressive treatment should be based on careful consideration of potential
benefits and risks.
Cases of gastroenteritis associated with vaccine virus have been reported post marketing in infants
with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID, see section 4.3).
In trials, RotaTeq was shed in the stools of 8.9 % of vaccine recipients almost exclusively in the week
after dose 1 and in only one vaccine recipient (0.3 %) after dose 3. Peak excretion occurred within
7 days of dosing. Transmission of vaccine virus strains to non-vaccinated contacts has been observed
post-marketing. RotaTeq should be administered with caution to individuals with close contacts who
are immunodeficient (e.g., individuals with malignancies or who are otherwise immunocompromised
or individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy). Also, those caring for recent vaccinees should
observe careful hygiene especially when handling excreta.
In a clinical study, RotaTeq was administered to approximately 1,000 infants who were born at a
gestational age of 25 to 36 weeks. The first dose was administered from 6 weeks after birth. The safety
and efficacy of RotaTeq were comparable between this subset of infants and infants born at term.
However, 19 of the approximately 1,000 infants were born at a gestational age of 25 to 28 weeks, 55
were born at a gestational age of 29 to 31 weeks and the remainder was born at a gestational age of
between 32 and 36 weeks. See sections 4.2 and 5.1.
Intussusception
As a precaution, healthcare professionals should follow-up on any symptoms indicative of
intussusception (severe abdominal pain, persistent vomiting, bloody stools, abdominal bloating and/or
high fever) since data from observational studies indicate an increased risk of intussusception, mostly
within 7 days after rotavirus vaccination (see section 4.8). Parents/guardians should be advised to
promptly report such symptoms to their healthcare provider.
For subjects with a predisposition for intussusception, see section 4.3.
Safety or efficacy data are not available for infants with active gastrointestinal illnesses (including
chronic diarrhoea) or growth retardation. Administration of RotaTeq may be considered with caution
in such infants when, in the opinion of the physician, withholding the vaccine entails a greater risk.
The level of protection provided by RotaTeq is based on the completion of all 3 doses. As with any
vaccine, vaccination with RotaTeq may not result in complete protection in all recipients. RotaTeq
does not protect against gastroenteritis due to other pathogens than rotavirus.
Clinical trials of efficacy against rotavirus gastroenteritis were performed in Europe, the United States,
Latin America, and Asia. During these trials, the most common circulating rotavirus genotype was
G1P[8], while rotavirus genotypes G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8], and G9P[8] were identified less often.
The extent of protection that RotaTeq might provide against other rotavirus types and in other
populations is unknown.
4
No clinical data are available on the use of RotaTeq for post-exposure prophylaxis.
The potential risk of apnoea and the need for respiratory monitoring for 48-72 h should be considered
when administering the primary immunisation series to very premature infants (born ≤28 weeks of
gestation) and particularly for those with a previous history of respiratory immaturity. As the benefit
of vaccination is high in this group of infants, vaccination should not be withheld or delayed.
RotaTeq SHOULD UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BE INJECTED.
Sucrose
RotaTeq contains sucrose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of fructose intolerance,
glucose-galactose malabsorption or sucrase-isomaltase insufficiency should not take this vaccine. See
section 2.
Sodium
This vaccine contains 37.6 mg sodium per dose, equivalent to 1.88% of the WHO recommended
maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. See section 2.
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Co-administration of RotaTeq with vaccines containing one or more of the following antigens at
approximately 2, 4 and 6 months of age demonstrated that the immune responses and the safety
profiles of the administered vaccines were unaffected:
-  Diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine (DTaP)
-  Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine (Hib)
- 
Inactivated poliomyelitis vaccine (IPV)
-  Hepatitis B vaccine (HBV)
-  Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV)
Co-administration of RotaTeq with DTaP-IPV-HBV-Hib vaccine (Infanrix hexa) at approximately 2,
3, and 4 months of age demonstrated that the immune responses and the safety profiles of the
co-administered vaccines were unaffected compared to separate administrations.
Co-administration of RotaTeq with a group C meningococcal conjugate vaccine (MenCC, the vaccine
studied was a tetanus toxoid conjugate) at 3 and 5 months of age (and mostly at the same time as
DTaP-IPV-Hib vaccine), followed by a third dose of RotaTeq at approximately 6 months of age,
demonstrated that the immune responses to RotaTeq and MenCC were unaffected. Co-administration
resulted in an acceptable safety profile.
Concomitant administration of RotaTeq and oral poliomyelitis vaccine (OPV) did not affect the
immune response to the poliovirus antigens. Although concomitant administration of OPV slightly
reduced the immune response to rotavirus vaccine, there is currently no evidence that clinical
protection against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis would be affected. The immune response to RotaTeq
was unaffected when OPV was administered two weeks after RotaTeq.
Therefore, RotaTeq can be given concomitantly with monovalent or combination infant vaccines
containing one or more of the following antigens: DTaP, Hib, IPV or OPV, HBV, PCV and MenCC.
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
RotaTeq is intended for use in infants only. Thus human data on use during pregnancy or lactation are
not available and animal fertility or reproduction studies have not been performed.
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Not relevant.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
a. Summary of the safety profile
In a subset of infants from 3 placebo-controlled clinical trials (n=6,130 recipients of RotaTeq and
5,560 placebo recipients), RotaTeq was evaluated for all adverse events within 42 days of vaccination
with or without concomitant use of other paediatric vaccines. Overall, 47 % of infants given RotaTeq
experienced an adverse reaction compared with 45.8 % of infants given placebo. The most commonly
reported adverse reactions that occurred more frequently with vaccine than with placebo were pyrexia
(20.9 %), diarrhoea (17.6 %) and vomiting (10.1 %).
Serious adverse reactions were assessed in all participants (36,150 recipients of RotaTeq and
35,536 placebo recipients) of 3 clinical trials for up to 42 days after each dose. The overall frequency
of these serious adverse reactions was 0.1 % among recipients of RotaTeq and 0.2 % among placebo
recipients.
b. Tabulated summary of adverse reactions
Adverse reactions more common in the vaccine group in clinical trials are listed below per system
organ class and frequency. Based on pooled data from 3 clinical trials in which 6,130 infants received
RotaTeq and 5,560 received placebo, the adverse reactions listed occurred with excess incidences in
RotaTeq recipients compared to placebo recipients of between 0.2 % and 2.5 %. 
Frequencies are reported as:
Very common (≥1/10); Common (≥1/100, <1/10); Uncommon (≥1/1,000, <1/100); Rare (≥1/10,000,
<1/1,000), Very rare (< 1/10,000), Not known (cannot be estimated from the available data)

c. Description of selected adverse reactions
Kawasaki disease was reported in 5 of 36,150 vaccine recipients (<0.1 %) and 1 of 35,536 placebo
recipients (<0.1 %) with a relative risk (RR) of 4.9 [95 % CI, 0.6 – 239.1] (not statistically significant).
No increased risk of Kawasaki disease was observed among infants receiving RotaTeq in a large post-
marketing observational safety surveillance study (see section 5.1).
Intussusception
Data from observational safety studies performed in several countries indicate that rotavirus vaccines
carry an increased risk of intussusception, with up to 6 additional cases per 100,000 infants within
7 days of vaccination. There is limited evidence of a smaller increased risk following the second dose.
The background incidence of intussusception in infants less than one year of age in these countries
ranged from 25 to 101 per 100,000 infants per year. It remains unclear whether rotavirus vaccines
affect the overall incidence of intussusception based on longer periods of follow up (see section 4.4).
d. Other special populations
Apnoea in very premature infants (born ≤28 weeks of gestation) (see section 4.4)
Gastroenteritis with vaccine viral shedding in infants with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency
Disease (SCID) has been reported post-marketing.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system
listed in Appendix V.
4.9  Overdose
There have been reports of administration of higher than recommended doses of RotaTeq.
In general, the adverse event profile reported with overdose was comparable to that observed with
recommended doses of RotaTeq.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, Viral Vaccine ATC code: J07BH02.
Efficacy
In clinical trials, efficacy was demonstrated against gastroenteritis due to rotavirus of genotypes
G1P[8], G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8], and G9P[8].
The protective efficacy of RotaTeq was evaluated in two ways in the placebo-controlled Rotavirus
Efficacy and Safety Trial (REST):
1. 
In 5,673 vaccinated infants (2,834 in the vaccine group) protective efficacy was measured as a
reduction in the incidence of rotavirus (RV) gastroenteritis caused by vaccine G genotypes
(G1-G4) that occurred at least 14 days after the third dose of vaccine through the first full
rotavirus season after vaccination. 
7
2. 
In 68,038 vaccinated infants (34,035 in the vaccine group) protective efficacy was measured as
a reduction in the rate of hospitalisations and emergency department visits for RV
gastroenteritis from 14 days after the third dose. 
The results of these analyses are presented in the following tables.

The reduction in incidence of RV gastroenteritis caused by genotypes G1-G4 during the second
rotavirus season after vaccination was 88.0 % [95 % CI 49.4, 98.7] for severe disease and 62.6 %
[95 % CI 44.3, 75.4] for disease of any severity.
Efficacy against genotypes G2P[4], G3P[8], G4P[8] and G9P[8] rotavirus was based on fewer cases
than for G1. The efficacy observed against G2P[4] most likely resulted from the G2 component of the
vaccine.
In a combined post-hoc analysis of REST and another phase III study, the vaccine efficacy against
G1-, G2-, G3- and G4-serotype RVG cases (any severity) was 61.5 % [95 % CI: 14.2; 84.2] among
infants who were >26 to ≤32 weeks of age at dose 3.
There was an extension of REST conducted in Finland only. This Finnish Extension Study (FES)
included a subset of 20,736 subjects that had been enrolled previously in REST. The infants were
followed for up to 3 years post-vaccination in the FES.
In REST there were 403 healthcare encounters (20 in the vaccine group and 383 in the placebo group)
associated with G1-G4 and G9 RV gastroenteritis in the per protocol population. The additional data
from the FES increased the number by 136 encounters in total, including 9 in the vaccine group and
127 in the placebo group. Overall, 31 % and 25 % of the encounters in the respective groups occurred
during the FES.
Based upon combined data from REST and the FES, the reduction up to 3 years post-vaccination in
the rate of hospitalisations and emergency department visits for RV gastroenteritis was 94.4 %
(95 % CI: 91.6, 96.2) for genotypes G1-G4, 95.5 % (95 % CI: 92.8, 97.2) for genotype G1, 81.9 %
(95 % CI: 16.1, 98.0) for genotype G2, 89.0 % (95 % CI: 53.3, 98.7) for genotype G3, 83.4 %
(95 % CI: 51.2, 95.8) for genotype G4, and 94.2 % (95 % CI: 62.2, 99.9) for genotype G9. During
year 3, there were no health care contacts for RV gastroenteritis in the vaccine group (n=3,112) and
one (non-typeable) in the placebo group (n=3,126).
8
 
A complete 3-dose vaccination series of RotaTeq should be administered (see section 4.2) to provide
the level and duration of protection against rotavirus gastroenteritis that was observed in the clinical
studies. However, post hoc analyses indicated that RotaTeq achieved some reduction in the numbers
of cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis of sufficient severity to require hospitalisation or an emergency
department visit before completion of all three doses (i.e. from approximately 14 days after
administration of the first dose onwards).
Efficacy in premature infants
In REST, RotaTeq was administered to approximately 1,000 infants who were born at a gestational
age of 25 to 36 weeks. The efficacy of RotaTeq was comparable between this subset of infants and
infants born at term.
Post-marketing observational safety surveillance study 
In a large prospective post-marketing observational study in the US, the risk of Kawasaki disease was
analysed among 85,150 infants receiving one or more doses of RotaTeq (17,433 person-years of
follow-up).
During the 0-30 day follow-up period after vaccination, there were no statistically significant
difference in the rate of Kawasaki disease compared with the expected background rate. In addition,
there was no statistically significant increased risk of this adverse event during the 0-30 day follow-up
period compared with a concurrent control group of infants who received DTaP, but not RotaTeq
(n=62,617, 12,339 person-years of follow-up). One chart-confirmed case was recorded among infants
vaccinated with RotaTeq compared with one chart-confirmed case among concurrent DTaP controls
(relative risk = 0.7, 95 % CI: 0.01-55.56). In the general safety analyses, no specific safety concerns
were identified.

Immunogenicity
The immunological mechanism by which RotaTeq protects against rotavirus gastroenteritis is not
completely understood. No immunological correlate of protection has currently been identified for
rotavirus vaccines. In phase III studies between 92.5 % and 100 % of recipients of RotaTeq achieved a
significant rise in serum anti-rotavirus IgA after a three-dose regimen. The vaccine induces an immune
response (i.e., appearance of serum neutralising antibody) to the five human-rotavirus proteins
expressed on the reassortants (G1, G2, G3, G4 and P[8]).
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties
Not applicable.
5.3  Preclinical safety data
A single and repeated dose oral toxicity study in mice suggests no special hazard to humans. The dose
administered to mice was approximately 2.79 x 108 infectious units per kg (about 14-fold the projected
infant dose).

Contents of the pack and other information
1.  What RotaTeq is and what it is used for
RotaTeq is an oral vaccine that helps protect infants and young children against gastroenteritis
(diarrhoea and vomiting) caused by rotavirus infection and may be given to infants from the age of
6 weeks to 32 weeks (see section 3). The vaccine contains five types of live rotavirus strains. When an
infant is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural defences) will make antibodies
against the most commonly occurring types of rotavirus. These antibodies help protect against
gastroenteritis caused by these types of rotavirus.
2.  What you need to know before your child receives RotaTeq
Do not use RotaTeq if
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
your child is allergic to any of the components of this vaccine (see section 6 Contents of the
pack and other information).
your child developed an allergic reaction after receiving a dose of RotaTeq or other rotavirus
vaccine.
your child has previously had intussusception (a bowel obstruction in which one segment of
bowel becomes enfolded within another segment).
your child was born with a malformation of the gastrointestinal system that might predispose for
intussusception.
your child has any disease which reduces his/her resistance to infection.
your child has a severe infection with a high temperature. It might be necessary to postpone the
vaccination until recovery. A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem, but talk to
your doctor first.
your child has diarrhoea or is vomiting. It might be necessary to postpone the vaccination until
recovery.
23
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using RotaTeq if your child:
- 
- 
has received a blood transfusion or immunoglobulins within the last 6 weeks.
has a close contact such as a household member who has a weakened immune system, e.g., a
person with cancer or who is taking medicines that may weaken the immune system.
has any disorder of the gastrointestinal system.
has not been gaining weight and growing as expected.
or the mother has taken any medicine during pregnancy that weakens the immune system.
- 
- 
- 
After your child has received RotaTeq, contact a doctor/health care professional right away if your
child experiences severe stomach pain, persistent vomiting, blood in stools, a swollen belly and/or
high fever (see also section 4 “Possible side effects”).
As always, please take care to wash your hands thoroughly after changing soiled nappies.  
As with other vaccines, RotaTeq may not completely protect all children who are vaccinated even
after all three doses have been given.  
If your child has already been infected with rotavirus but is not yet ill when vaccinated, RotaTeq may
not be able to prevent the illness. 
RotaTeq does not protect against diarrhoea and vomiting due to causes other than rotavirus. 
Other medicines and RotaTeq
RotaTeq may be given at the same time as your child receives other normally recommended
vaccinations, such as diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), Haemophilus influenzae type b,
inactivated or oral poliomyelitis, hepatitis B, pneumococcal conjugate and meningococcus group C
conjugate vaccines.
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other
medicines (or other vaccines).
RotaTeq with food and drink
There are no restrictions on taking food or liquid, including breast milk, either before or after
vaccination with RotaTeq. 
RotaTeq contains sucrose
If you have been told that your child has an intolerance to some sugars, inform your doctor/health care
professional before the vaccine is administered.  
RotaTeq contains sodium
This vaccine contains 37.6 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each dose. This is
equivalent to 1.88% of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.
24
3.  How to use RotaTeq
RotaTeq IS FOR ORAL USE ONLY.
A doctor or nurse will administer the recommended doses of RotaTeq to your child. The vaccine will
be given by gently squeezing the tube and delivering the vaccine into your child’s mouth. 
The vaccine can be given without regard to food, liquid, or breast milk. 
In case your child spits out or regurgitates most of the vaccine dose, a single replacement dose may be
given at the same vaccination visit. 
Under no circumstance should this vaccine be administered by injection. 
The first dose (2 ml) of RotaTeq may be given from the age of 6 weeks and should be given before
12 weeks of age (about 3 months). RotaTeq may be given to infants who were born early provided that
the pregnancy had lasted at least 25 weeks. These infants should receive the first dose of vaccine
between 6 and 12 weeks after birth.
Your child will receive 3 doses of RotaTeq given at least four weeks apart. It is important that your
child receives all 3 doses of the vaccine for protection against rotavirus. It is preferred that all three
doses should be given by the age of 20-22 weeks and at latest all three doses should be given by the
age of 32 weeks.
When RotaTeq is given to your child for the first dose, it is recommended that your child also receives
RotaTeq (and not another rotavirus vaccine) to complete the vaccination course. 
If you forget an appointment for RotaTeq
It is important that you follow the instructions of your doctor/health care professional regarding your
child’s return visits for the follow-up doses. If you forget or are not able to go back to your
doctor/health care professional at the scheduled time, ask him or her for advice. 
4.

(anaphylaxis), and may include: allergic swelling that may affect the face, lips, tongue or throat.
  Bronchospasm (rare, may affect up to 1 in 1000 infants). This may present as wheezing,
coughing or difficulty breathing.
  Severe stomach pain, persistent vomiting, blood in stools, a swollen belly and/or high fever.
These could be symptoms of a very rare (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 infants), but serious, side
effect called intussusception (a bowel obstruction in which one segment of bowel becomes
enfolded within another segment).
The following other side effects reported with the use of RotaTeq were:
  Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 infants): fever, diarrhoea, vomiting

Reporting of side effects
If your child gets any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side
effects not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting

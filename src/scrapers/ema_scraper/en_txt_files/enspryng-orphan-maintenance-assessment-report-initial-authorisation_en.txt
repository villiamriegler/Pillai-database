2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
Orphan medicinal product designation 
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2016 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
The sponsor Chugai Pharma Europe Ltd submitted on 29 January 2016 an application for designation 
as an orphan medicinal product to the European Medicines Agency for a medicinal product containing 
humanised anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody for treatment of neuromyelitis optica. The 
application was submitted on the basis of Article 3(1)(a) first paragraph of Regulation (EC) No 
141/2000 on orphan medicinal products. 
For the purpose of orphan designation, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP) 
considered that the condition originally proposed by the sponsor should be renamed as “neuromyelitis 
optica spectrum disorders” (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) based on the International Panel 
for Neuromyelitis Optica Diagnosis (Neurology 2015; 85:1-13). 
Having examined the application, the COMP considered that the sponsor has established the following: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing humanised anti-IL-6 
receptor monoclonal antibody was considered justified based on the reduction of plasmablast 
population in cells isolated from patients affected by the condition, in combination with clinical data 
with a comparable antibody, which improved the annualised relapse rate and the Expanded 
Disability Status Scale score in patients affected by the condition; 
the condition is chronically debilitating and life-threatening due to neurological impairment such as 
paraplegia, sensory loss, bladder dysfunction, peripheral pain, and increased 5-year mortality; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting approximately 0.4 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time the application was made.  
Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products are fulfilled. 
The sponsor has also established that there exists no satisfactory method of treatment that has been 
authorised in the European Union for patients affected by the condition. 
Thus, the requirement under Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal 
products is fulfilled. 
The COMP concludes that the requirements laid down in Article (3)(1) (a) and (b) of Regulation (EC) 
No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are fulfilled. The COMP therefore recommends the 
designation of this medicinal product, containing humanised anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody as 
an orphan medicinal product for the orphan indication: treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum 
disorders.

3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation 
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
The proposed condition represents a group of severe autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating 
disorders that are typically characterized by optic neuritis and transverse myelitis. The 2015 consensus 
defines describes 5 core clinical characteristics: optic neuritis, acute myelitis, postrema syndrome, 
narcolepsy or acute diencephalic clinical syndrome with typical MRI findings, symptomatic cerebral 
syndrome with MRI findings. In general, at least 2 core characteristics (for the NMOSD without 
autoantibodies) or 1 core characteristic and presence of autoantibodies are required (Wingerchuk, 
Neurology 2015; 85:1-13). 
The proposed therapeutic indication “Enspryng is indicated as a monotherapy or in combination with 
immunosuppressive therapy (IST) for the treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders 
(NMOSD) in adult and adolescent patients from 12 years of age who are anti-aquaporin-4 IgG (AQP4-
IgG) seropositive” falls entirely within the scope of the designated orphan condition “treatment of 
neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility was considered justified on the basis of the positive benefit/risk assessment of 
the CHMP.  
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The COMP has previously noted that the condition is chronically debilitating due to neurological 
impairment such as paraplegia, sensory loss, bladder dysfunction, and central visual loss accompanied 
by ocular pain and life-threatening with the 5-year mortality reported as high as 30%. The sponsor has 
not noted any changes in the seriousness of the disease since designation. The seriousness of NMOSD 
is acknowledged. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The sponsor conducted a literature review and identified three European studies, which they use 
supported by several non-EU reference publications. 
The three European studies were the following: 
•  Bizzoco et al (2009) reviewed 850 patients diagnosed with demyelinating disorders in north east 
Tuscany between 1998 and 2006 using current diagnostic techniques. This paper does not give a 
population-based prevalence but the "prevalence" of NMOSD amongst this group of patients was 
1.5%, of which 56% had NMO. 
•  Asgari et al (2011) reviewed 477 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS), acute transverse myelitis 
(TM) or optic neuritis (ON) diagnosed between 1998 and 2008 in southern Denmark according to 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000016001 
Page 5/7 
 
 
 
 
 
contemporary diagnostic criteria. They identified a total of 42 NMO/NMOSD patients (36 NMO, 6 
NMOSD, 62% of whom were anti-AQP4 antibody positive) and calculated a population-based 
prevalence estimate of 0.44 per 10,000 individuals. 
•  Cossburn et al (2012) surveyed medical records of 717,572 patients from south Wales and 
identified 14 cases of NMO/NMOSD (11 NMO, 3 NMOSD) using contemporary diagnostic criteria, 
giving a population-based prevalence estimate of 0.196 per 10,000 patients. 
Further studies referring to extra-European populations were also reviewed but are not going to be 
further commented herein. Previously the COMP considered the population-based retrospective case 
series study referred above, in a Caucasian population in the Region of Southern Denmark, as a 
conservative estimate (Asgari et al, 2011 0.44/10,000).  
An approximately 0.4 conclusion was considered acceptable for the time of the review. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
There is one product that has been identified as authorised in the treatment of the proposed orphan 
condition. In particular, Soliris is indicated (among others) in adults for the treatment of “Neuromyelitis 
optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) in patients who are anti-aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibody-positive with 
a relapsing course of the disease”. 
For the purpose of establishing whether this product is relevant for the significant benefit exercise, the 
therapeutic indication of Enspryng was juxtaposed to the one of Soliris. Enspryng is indicated, as 
discussed above: “as a monotherapy or in combination with immunosuppressive therapy (IST) for the 
treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (NMOSD) in adult and adolescent patients from 
12 years who are antiaquaporin 4 (AQP4) seropositive”. 
Having regard to the two indications, the COMP noted that whereas Soliris is indeed authorised in 
NMOSD, no authorised products exist for the entirety of the population for which Enspryng is indicated. 
In particular, no authorised products exist for the adolescent AQP4 positive patients and for AQP4 
positive patients without a prior relapsing course of the disease. The authorised indication of Enspryng 
is thus broader than the indication of Soliris, as it includes additional patient populations for whom 
Soliris is not authorised. 
The COMP concluded that Soliris would not be qualified as a satisfactory treatment for the purpose of 
the examination of the significant benefit of Enspryng, as Soliris does not cover the entire patient 
population for which Enspryng is intended.

5.  COMP position adopted on 26 April 2021 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product; 
the prevalence of neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorders (hereinafter referred to as “the 
condition”) was estimated to remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be 0.4 in 10,000 
persons in the European Union, at the time of the review of the orphan designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to neurological impairment such as paraplegia, sensory 
loss, bladder dysfunction, and central visual loss accompanied by ocular pain and life-threatening 
with the 5-year mortality reported as high as 30%; 
at present no satisfactory method has been authorised in the European Union for the treatment of 
the entirety of patients covered by the therapeutic indication of Enspryng. 
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Enspryng, satralizumab, 
humanised anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody for treatment of neuromyelitis optica spectrum 
disorders (EU/3/16/1680) is not removed from the Community Register of Orphan Medicinal Products.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
TALVEY is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory 
multiple myeloma, who have received at least 3 prior therapies, including an immunomodulatory 
agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody and have demonstrated disease progression
on the last therapy.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment with TALVEY should be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in the 
treatment of multiple myeloma.
TALVEY should be administered by a healthcare professional with adequately-trained medical 
personnel and appropriate medical equipment to manage severe reactions, including cytokine release 
syndrome (CRS) and neurologic toxicity, including immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity 
syndrome (ICANS).
Posology
Pre-treatment medicinal products should be administered prior to each dose of TALVEY during the 
step-up phase (see below).
TALVEY should be administered subcutaneously on a weekly or biweekly (every 2 weeks) dosing
schedule according to Table 1. Patients who receive talquetamab according to the 0.4 mg/kg weekly 
2
dosing schedule and have attained an adequate clinical response that is confirmed in at least two 
consecutive disease assessments can be considered for switch to the 0.8 mg/kg biweekly dosing 
schedule.

c Maintain a minimum of 6 days between weekly doses and a minimum of 12 days between biweekly (every 2 weeks) doses.
Patients should be instructed to remain within proximity of a healthcare facility and monitored for 
48 hours after administration of all doses within the TALVEY step-up phase for signs and symptoms 
of CRS and ICANS (see section 4.4).
Duration of treatment
Patients should be treated with TALVEY until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
Pre-treatment
The following pre-treatment medicinal products must be administered 1 to 3 hours before each dose of 
TALVEY during the step-up phase to reduce the risk of CRS (see section 4.4).



Corticosteroid (oral or intravenous dexamethasone 16 mg or equivalent)
Antihistamine (oral or intravenous diphenhydramine 50 mg or equivalent)
Antipyretics (oral or intravenous paracetamol 650 mg to 1 000 mg or equivalent)
Pre-treatment medicinal products should be administered prior to subsequent doses for patients who 
repeat doses within the TALVEY step-up phase due to dose delays (see Table 2) or for patients who 
experienced CRS (see Table 3).
Prevention of infection
Prior to starting treatment with TALVEY, prophylaxis should be considered for the prevention of 
infections, per local institutional guidelines.
Dose delays
If a dose of TALVEY is delayed, therapy should be restarted based on recommendations in Table 2,
and weekly or biweekly dosing should be resumed accordingly (see Posology above). Pre-treatment 
medicinal products should be administered prior to restarting TALVEY, and patients should be 
monitored accordingly (see section 4.2).

(every 2 weeks) dosing accordingly (see section 4.2).
Dose modifications for adverse reactions
Dose delays may be required to manage toxicities related to TALVEY (see section 4.4). See Table 2 
for recommendations on restarting TALVEY after a dose delay.
See Tables 3 and 4 for recommended actions for the management of CRS and ICANS. See Table 6 for 
recommended dose modifications for other adverse reactions.
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)
CRS should be identified based on clinical presentation (see section 4.4). Other causes of fever, 
hypoxia, and hypotension should be evaluated and treated. If CRS is suspected, TALVEY should be 
withheld until CRS resolves and should be managed according to the recommendations in Table 3. 
Supportive therapy for CRS should be administered, which may include intensive care for severe or 
life-threatening CRS. Laboratory testing should be considered to monitor for disseminated 
intravascular coagulation (DIC), haematology parameters, as well as pulmonary, cardiac, renal, and 
hepatic function.

Limited or no data are available in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment.
Method of administration
TALVEY is for subcutaneous use.
The required volume of TALVEY should be injected into the subcutaneous tissue of the abdomen 
(preferred injection site). Alternatively, TALVEY may be injected into the subcutaneous tissue at 
other sites (e.g., thigh). If multiple injections are required, TALVEY injections should be at least 2 cm 
apart.
TALVEY must not be injected into tattoos or scars or areas where the skin is red, bruised, tender, hard 
or not intact.
For instructions on handling of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Cytokine release syndrome (CRS)
CRS, including life-threatening or fatal reactions, may occur in patients receiving TALVEY (see 
section 4.8). Clinical signs and symptoms of CRS may include but are not limited to pyrexia, 
hypotension, chills, hypoxia, headache, tachycardia and elevated transaminases. Potentially 
life-threatening complications of CRS may include cardiac dysfunction, acute respiratory distress 
syndrome, neurologic toxicity, renal and/or hepatic failure, and disseminated intravascular coagulation 
(DIC).
TALVEY therapy should be initiated with step-up phase dosing and pre-treatment medicinal products
(corticosteroids, antihistamine, and antipyretics) should be administered prior to each dose of 
TALVEY during the step-up phase to reduce the risk of CRS. Patients should be monitored following 
administration accordingly. In patients who experience CRS following their previous dose, 
pre-treatment medicinal products should be administered prior to the next TALVEY dose (see
section 4.2).
Subjects who experienced Grade 3 or higher CRS with any previous T cell redirection therapy were 
excluded from clinical studies. It cannot be excluded that prior severe CRS with chimeric antigen 
receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy or other T-cell engagers might impact on the safety of TALVEY. The 
9
potential benefits of treatment should be carefully weighed against the risk of neurologic events, and 
heightened caution should be exercised when administering TALVEY to these patients.
Patients should be counselled to seek medical attention should signs or symptoms of CRS occur. At 
the first sign of CRS, patients should be immediately evaluated for hospitalisation and treatment with 
supportive care, tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids, should be instituted based on severity. The use of 
myeloid growth factors, particularly granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), 
should be avoided during CRS. TALVEY should be withheld until CRS resolves (see section 4.2).
Neurologic toxicity, including ICANS
Serious or life-threatening neurologic toxicities, including ICANS have occurred following treatment 
with TALVEY (see section 4.8).
ICANS, including fatal reactions, have occurred following treatment with TALVEY. The onset of 
ICANS can be concurrent with CRS, following resolution of CRS, or in the absence of CRS. Clinical 
signs and symptoms of ICANS may include but are not limited to confusional state, depressed level of 
consciousness, disorientation, somnolence, lethargy, and bradyphrenia.
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of neurologic toxicities and treated promptly. 
Patients should be counselled to seek medical attention should signs or symptoms of neurologic 
toxicities including ICANS occur. At the first sign of neurologic toxicities including ICANS, the 
patient should be immediately evaluated and supportive care should be provided based on severity.
Patients who experience Grade 2 or higher ICANS should be instructed to remain within proximity of 
a healthcare facility and monitored for signs and symptoms for 48 hours following the next dose of 
TALVEY.
For ICANS and other neurologic toxicities, TALVEY should be withheld or discontinued based on 
severity and management recommendations should be followed as indicated in Table 4 (see 
section 4.2).
There are no data on use of talquetamab in patients with CNS involvement of myeloma or other 
clinically relevant CNS pathologies as a result of their exclusion from the study due to the potential 
risk of ICANS.
Due to the potential for ICANS, patients should be instructed to avoid driving or operating machines 
during the step-up phase and for 48 hours after completion of the step-up phase, and in the event of 
new onset of any neurological symptoms, until symptoms resolve (see section 4.7).
Management of neurologic toxicities
At the first sign of neurologic toxicity, including ICANS, neurology evaluation should be considered. 
Other causes of neurologic symptoms should be ruled out. TALVEY should be withheld until adverse 
reaction resolves (see Table 4). Intensive care and supportive therapy should be provided for severe or 
life-threatening neurologic toxicities.
Oral toxicity
Oral toxicities, including dysgeusia, dry mouth, dysphagia, and stomatitis occur very commonly 
following treatment with TALVEY (see section 4.8).
Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of oral toxicity. Patients should be counselled to 
seek medical attention should signs or symptoms of oral toxicity occur, and supportive care should be 
provided. Supportive care may include saliva stimulating agents, steroid mouth wash, or consultation 
with a nutritionist. TALVEY should be interrupted or less frequent dosing should be considered (see 
section 4.2).
10
Over time, notable weight loss may occur (see section 4.8). Weight change should be monitored 
regularly during therapy. Clinically significant weight loss should be further evaluated. TALVEY
should be interrupted or less frequent dosing should be considered (see section 4.2).
Serious infections
Serious infections, including life-threatening or fatal infections, have been reported in patients 
receiving TALVEY (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of 
infection prior to and during treatment with TALVEY and treated appropriately. Prophylactic 
antimicrobials should be administered according to local guidelines. TALVEY should not be 
administered in patients with active serious infection. TALVEY should be withheld as indicated (see 
section 4.2). Patients should be instructed to seek medical advice if signs or symptoms suggestive of 
an infection occur.
Hypogammaglobulinaemia
Hypogammaglobulinaemia has been reported in patients receiving TALVEY (see section 4.8).
Immunoglobulin levels should be monitored during treatment with TALVEY. Intravenous or 
subcutaneous immunoglobulin therapy was used to treat hypogammaglobulinaemia patients. Patients 
should be treated according to local institutional guidelines, including infection precautions, antibiotic 
or antiviral prophylaxis, and administration of immunoglobulin replacement.
Cytopenias
Treatment-emergent Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and thrombocytopenia have been 
observed in patients who received TALVEY. A majority of cytopenias occurred during the first 8 to 
10 weeks. Complete blood counts should be monitored at baseline and periodically during treatment. 
Supportive care should be provided per local institutional guidelines.
Patients with neutropenia should be monitored for signs of infection. TALVEY should be withheld as 
warranted (see section 4.2).
Skin reactions
TALVEY can cause skin reactions including rash, maculo-papular rash, erythema, erythematous rash, 
as well as nail disorders (see section 4.8). Skin reactions including rash progression should be 
monitored for early intervention and treatment with corticosteroids. For Grade 3 or higher, or 
worsening Grade 1 or 2 rashes, oral steroids should also be administered. For non-rash skin reactions 
dose modification may be considered (see Table 6).
For skin reactions and nail disorders, TALVEY should be withheld based on severity and institutional 
guidelines should be followed (see section 4.2).
Vaccines
Immune response to vaccines may be reduced when taking TALVEY. The safety of immunisation 
with live viral vaccines during or following TALVEY treatment has not been studied. Vaccination 
with live virus vaccines is not recommended for at least 4 weeks prior to the start of treatment, during 
treatment, and at least 4 weeks after treatment.
For unexpected exposure during pregnancy, see section 4.6.
Women of child-bearing potential/contraception
Pregnancy status of females of child-bearing potential should be verified prior to initiating treatment 
with TALVEY. Females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment 
and for 3 months after the last dose of TALVEY (see section 4.6).

Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed.
Talquetamab causes release of cytokines (see section 5.1) that may suppress activity of cytochrome 
P450 (CYP) enzymes, potentially resulting in increased exposure of CYP substrates. The highest risk 
of drug-drug interaction is expected to occur from initiation of talquetamab step-up phase up to 9 days 
after the first treatment dose and during and after CRS (see section 4.4). Monitor for toxicity or 
concentrations of medicinal products that are CYP (e.g., CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4/5, CYP2D6)
substrates where minimal concentration changes may lead to serious adverse reactions. The dose of 
concomitant CYP (e.g., CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP3A4/5, CYP2D6) substrate drugs should be 
adjusted as needed.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in females
Pregnancy status of females of child-bearing potential should be verified prior to initiating treatment 
with TALVEY.
Females of reproductive potential should use effective contraception during treatment and for 
3 months after the last dose of TALVEY.
Pregnancy
There are no available data on the use of TALVEY in pregnant women or animal data to assess the 
risk of TALVEY in pregnancy. Human IgG is known to cross the placenta after the first trimester of 
pregnancy. Therefore, talquetamab has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the 
developing foetus. The effects of TALVEY on the developing foetus are unknown. TALVEY is not 
recommended for women who are pregnant or for women of childbearing potential not using 
contraception.
If TALVEY is taken during pregnancy, a reduced immune response to vaccines may be expected in 
newborns. Consequently, newborn vaccinations with live vaccines such as BCG vaccine should be 
postponed until 4 weeks.
Breast-feeding
It is not known whether talquetamab is excreted in human milk. Because the potential for serious 
adverse reactions in breast-fed infants is unknown for TALVEY, patients should not breast-feed 
during treatment with TALVEY and for at least 3 months after the last dose.
Fertility
There are no data on the effect of talquetamab on fertility. Effects of talquetamab on male and female 
fertility have not been evaluated in animal studies.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
TALVEY has major influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
12
Due to the potential for ICANS, patients receiving TALVEY are at risk of depressed level of 
consciousness (see section 4.4). Patients should be instructed to avoid driving or operating machines
during the step-up phase and for 48 hours after completion of the step-up phase (see section 4.2), and 
in the event of new onset of any neurological symptoms, until symptoms resolve.

Description of selected adverse reactions
Cytokine release syndrome
In MonumenTAL-1 (N=339), CRS occurred in 77% of patients. Most events were Grade 1 or 2, with 
Grade 3 events occurring in 1.5% of patients. Thirty one percent (31%) of patients experienced more 
than one CRS event. Most events occurred during the step-up phase following the 0.01 mg/kg dose 
(29%), the 0.06 mg/kg dose (44%), the 0.3 mg/kg dose (for patients who received biweekly [every 
2 weeks] dosing; 33%), or the initial treatment dose (0.4 mg/kg [30%] or 0.8 mg/kg [12%]). Less than 
4% of CRS events occurred from week 5 onward; all events were Grade 1. The median time to onset 
of CRS was 27 hours from the last dose, 91% of events occurred within 48 hours from the last dose, 
and the median duration was 17 hours. Tocilizumab, corticosteroids and tocilizumab in combination 
with corticosteroids were used to treat CRS in 39%, 5% and 3.5% of CRS events, respectively.
Clinical signs and symptoms of CRS may include but are not limited to pyrexia (76%), hypotension 
(15%), chills (12%), hypoxia (7%), headache (4.7%), tachycardia (5%) and elevated transaminases
(aspartate aminotransferase [1.5%] and alanine aminotransferase [0.9%]).
Neurologic toxicities
In MonumenTAL-1 (N=339), neurologic toxicity events were reported in 29% of patients receiving 
TALVEY. Neurologic toxicity events were Grade 1 (17%), Grade 2 (11%), Grade 3 (2.3%) or Grade 4 
(0.3%). The most frequently reported neurologic toxicity event was headache (9%).
ICANS were only collected for Phase 2 in MonumenTAL-1. Of the 265 patients in Phase 2, ICANS 
occurred in 9.8% (n=26) of patients. Most events were Grade 1 or 2, with Grade 3 and 4 events 
occurring in 2.3% of patients. The most frequent clinical manifestation of ICANS reported were
confusional state (3.8%), disorientation (1.9%), somnolence (1.9%) and depressed level of 
consciousness (1.9%). Sixty-eight percent (68%) were concurrent with CRS (during or within 7 days 
of CRS resolution). Three percent (3%) of patients experienced more than one ICANS event. In 
addition, one fatal ICANS event was reported in MonumenTAL-1. Most patients experienced ICANS 
during the step-up phase following the 0.01 mg/kg dose, the 0.06 mg/kg dose, or the initial treatment 
dose (0.4 mg/kg and 0.8 mg/kg) (3% each). The median time to onset of ICANS was 28 hours from 
the last dose, 68% of events started within 48 hours from the last dose, 32% of events occurred after 
48 hours, and the median duration of ICANS was 9 hours.
Oral toxicity
In MonumenTAL-1 (N=339), seventy-eight percent (78%) of patients had Grade 1 or 2 events, with 
Grade 3 events occurring in 2% of patients. Oral toxicity events included dysgeusia, dry mouth, 
dysphagia, and stomatitis were reported.
15
Serious infections
In MonumenTAL-1 (N=339), Grade 3 or Grade 4 infections occurred in 19% of patients; fatal 
infections occurred in 1.5% of patients - COVID-19 pneumonia, fungal sepsis, infection and septic 
shock. The most frequently reported (≥ 2%) Grade 3 or 4 infection was pneumonia. Febrile 
neutropenia was observed in 1% of patients with 1.2% experiencing serious febrile neutropenia. See 
section 4.4 for monitoring and management guidance.
Hypogammaglobulinaemia
Post baseline IgG values of less than 500 mg/dl consistent with hypogammaglobulinaemia have been 
reported in 64% of patients treated with talquetamab at the 0.4 mg/kg weekly dose schedule, 66% of 
patients at the 0.8 mg/kg biweekly dose schedule and in 71% of patients with prior T cell redirection 
therapy (see section 4.4).
Skin reactions
In MonumenTAL-1 (N=339), the majority of rash cases were Grade 1 or 2, with Grade 3 events 
occurring in 3.5% of patients. The median time to onset from the first treatment dose for rash was 
22 days. The majority of non-rash skin toxicities were Grade 1 or 2, with Grade 3 pruritus occurring in 
0.3% of patients. Nail disorders occurred in 56% of patients and were Grade 1 or 2. See section 4.4 for 
management guidance.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Symptoms and signs
The maximum tolerated dose of talquetamab has not been determined. In clinical studies, doses of up 
to 1.2 mg/kg once every 2 weeks and 1.6 mg/kg every month have been administered.
Treatment
In the event of an overdose, the patient should be monitored for any signs or symptoms of adverse 
effects and appropriate symptomatic treatment should be instituted immediately.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Monoclonal antibodies and antibody drug conjugates, ATC code: not yet 
assigned
Mechanism of action
Talquetamab is a immunoglobulin G4 proline, alanine, alanine (IgG4 PAA) bispecific antibody 
directed against GPRC5D and the CD3 receptor on T Cells.
Talquetamab promotes enhanced T cell-mediated cytotoxicity through recruitment of CD3-expressing 
T cells to GPRC5D-expressing cells. This leads to the activation of T cells and induces subsequent 
lysis of GPRC5D-expressing cells mediated by secreted perforin and various granzymes stored in the 
secretory vesicles of cytotoxic T cells. Based on the expression of GPRC5D on plasma cells with 
16
minimal to no expression detected on B cells and B cell precursors, talquetamab targets multiple 
myeloma cells particularly.
Pharmacodynamic effects
Within the first month of treatment with talquetamab, activation and redistribution of T cells and 
induction of serum cytokines were observed.
Clinical efficacy and safety
The efficacy of TALVEY monotherapy was evaluated in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple 
myeloma in a single-arm, open-label, multicentre study, MonumenTAL-1. The study included patients
who had previously received at least three prior therapies, including a proteasome inhibitor, an 
immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. The study excluded patients who 
received T cell redirection therapy within 3 months, prior Grade 3 or higher CRS related to any T cell 
redirection therapy, an allogenic stem cell transplant within the past 6 months, autologous stem cell 
transplant within 3 months, stroke or seizure within the past 6 months, CNS involvement or clinical 
signs of meningeal involvement of multiple myeloma, plasma cell leukaemia, active or documented 
history of autoimmune disease, with the exception of vitiligo, resolved childhood atopic dermatitis, 
POEMS syndrome, primary light chain amyloidosis and prior Grave’s disease that was euthyroid 
based on clinical symptoms and laboratory testing.
Patients received TALVEY 0.4 mg/kg subcutaneously weekly, following two step-up doses (0.01 and 
0.06 mg/kg) in the first week of therapy, or TALVEY 0.8 mg/kg subcutaneously biweekly (every 
2 weeks), following three step-up doses (0.01, 0.06 and 0.3 mg/kg), until disease progression or 
unacceptable toxicity. Patients were hospitalised for monitoring for at least 48 hours after each 
TALVEY dose during the step-up phase.
Of 143 patients treated with TALVEY 0.4 mg/kg weekly who were not exposed to prior T cell 
redirection therapy, the median age was 67 (range: 46 to 86) years, 55% were male, 90% were White, 
and 8% were Black or African American. Patients had received a median of 5 (range: 2 to 13) prior 
therapies, and 78% of patients had received prior autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). 
Ninety-four percent (94%) of patients were refractory to their last therapy, and 74% were refractory to 
a PI, immunomodulatory agent, and anti-CD38 antibody. Of the 132 patients for whom baseline 
cytogenetic data were available, high-risk cytogenetic factors (presence of t(4:14), t(14:16), and/or 
del(17p)) were present in 31% of patients. Twenty-three percent (23%) of patients had extramedullary 
plasmacytomas.
Of 145 patients treated with TALVEY 0.8 mg/kg biweekly (every 2 weeks) who were not exposed to 
prior T cell redirection therapy, the median age was 67 (range: 38 to 84) years, 57% were male, 86% 
were White, and 6% were Black or African American. Patients had received a median of 5 (range: 2 to 
17) prior therapies, and 79% of patients had received prior autologous stem cell transplantation 
(ASCT). Ninety-four percent (94%) of patients were refractory to their last therapy, and 69% were 
refractory to a proteasome inhibitor, immunomodulatory agent, and anti-CD38 antibody. Of the 
128 patients for whom baseline cytogenetic data were available, high-risk cytogenetic factors 
(presence of t(4:14), t(14:16), and/or del(17p)) were present in 29% of patients. Twenty-six percent 
(26%) of patients had extramedullary plasmacytomas.
Efficacy results were based on an overall response rate as determined by the Independent Review 
Committee assessment using IMWG criteria. The median duration of follow-up among patients 
receiving TALVEY 0.4 mg/kg weekly was 18.8 months; an estimated 51.5% of responders maintained 
response for at least 9 months.

ORR results were consistent across pre-specified subgroups, including number of prior lines of 
therapy, refractoriness to prior therapy, and cytogenetic risk at baseline.
Immunogenicity
In MonumenTAL-1, 328 patients treated with subcutaneous talquetamab monotherapy at 0.4 mg/kg 
weekly or 0.8 mg/kg biweekly (every 2 weeks), with or without prior T cell redirection therapy, were 
evaluated for antibodies to talquetamab. Following treatment 0.4 mg/kg weekly or 0.8 mg/kg biweekly 
(every 2 weeks), 106 of 328 patients (32.3%) developed anti-talquetamab antibodies. 
The limited number of anti-talquetamab antibody (ADA) positive subjects and the lack of information 
of the neutralising ADA, preclude drawing a definite conclusion regarding the effect of the 
neutralising ADAs on clinical parameters.
Paediatric population
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
TALVEY in all subsets of the paediatric population in the treatment of multiple myeloma (see 
section 4.2 for information on paediatric use).
This medicinal product has been authorised under a so-called ‘conditional approval’ scheme. 
This means that further evidence on this medicinal product is awaited. 
The European Medicines Agency will review new information on this medicinal product at least every 
year and this SmPC will be updated as necessary.
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
0.4 mg/kg weekly dose
Talquetamab exhibited approximately dose-proportional pharmacokinetics following subcutaneous 
administration across a dose ranging from 0.005 to 0.8 mg/kg weekly (0.0125 to 2 times the 
recommended 0.4 mg/kg weekly dose). The mean accumulation ratio between the 1st and 7th weekly 
dose of talquetamab 0.4 mg/kg was 3.9- and 4.5-fold for Cmax and AUCtau, respectively.
Pharmacokinetic parameters of talquetamab following the 1st and 7th recommended weekly dose of 
0.4 mg/kg are shown in Table 10.

mean ± standard deviation, except for Tmax which is presented as median (minimum- maximum).
0.8 mg/kg biweekly dose
Talquetamab exhibited approximately dose-proportional pharmacokinetics following subcutaneous 
administration across a dose ranging from 0.8 mg/kg to 1.2 mg/kg biweekly (1.0 to 1.5 times the 
recommended 0.8 mg/kg biweekly dose). The mean accumulation ratio between the 1st and 5th
biweekly dose of talquetamab 0.8 mg/kg was 2.3- and 2.2-fold for Cmax and AUCtau, respectively.

Pharmacokinetic parameters of talquetamab following the 1st and 5th recommended biweekly 
maintenance dose of 0.8 mg/kg are shown in Table 11.

Absorption
Based on the population pharmacokinetic model, the typical value of the bioavailability of 
talquetamab was 62% when administered subcutaneously relative to intravenous dosing.
At 0.4 mg/kg weekly dose regimen, the median (range) Tmax of talquetamab after the 1st and 7th
treatment doses were 3 (1 to 8) days and 2 (1 to 6) days, respectively.
At 0.8 mg/kg biweekly (every 2 weeks) dose regimen, the median (range) Tmax of talquetamab after 
the 1st and 5th treatment doses were 3 (2 to 14) days and 3 (1 to 8) days, respectively.
Distribution
Based on the population pharmacokinetic model, the typical value of the volume of distribution was 
4.3 L (22% CV [coefficient of variation]) for the central compartment, and 5.8 L (83% CV) for the 
peripheral compartment.
Elimination
Talquetamab exhibited both linear time-independent and time-dependent clearance. Based on the 
population pharmacokinetic model and the post hoc parameters of participants receiving SC doses 
(N=392), the median total clearance is 1.64 L/day at initial treatment and 0.80 L/day at steady state. 
The time-dependent clearance accounted for 48.8% of total clearance at initial treatment and then 
decreased exponentially to < 5% at around Week 16. The concentration-time profile at Week 16 would 
reach 90% of steady-state concentration for both 0.4 mg/kg weekly and 0.8 mg/kg biweekly regimens. 
The median terminal phase half-life was 7.56 days at initial treatment, and 12.2 days at steady state.
Special populations
The pharmacokinetic analysis includes 86 % White (n=424), 9% Black (n=43), 2.2% Asian (n=11), 
and 2.8% Others (n=14). Based on population PK analysis, the race or ethnicity, sex and body weight 
(range: 40 to 143 kg) did not have clinically meaningful effects on the pharmacokinetics of 
talquetamab.
Paediatric population
The pharmacokinetics of TALVEY in paediatric patients aged 17 years and younger have not been 
investigated.
20
Elderly
Results of population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that age (33 to 86 years) did not influence the 
pharmacokinetics of talquetamab. Only limited data for patients ≥ 85 years was available (see 
Table 12).

Renal impairment
No formal studies of talquetamab in patients with renal impairment have been conducted.
Results of population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that mild (60 mL/min ≤ absolute glomerular 
filtration rate (GFR) < 90 mL/min) or moderate (30 mL/min ≤ absolute GFR < 60 mL/min) renal 
impairment did not significantly influence the pharmacokinetics of talquetamab. No data is available 
in patients with severe renal impairment.
Hepatic impairment
No formal studies of talquetamab in patients with hepatic impairment have been conducted.
Using the NCI classification, results of population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that mild hepatic 
impairment (total bilirubin > 1 to 1.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) and any aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), or total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN) did not significantly influence the 
pharmacokinetics of talquetamab. Limited data (n=2) are available in participants with moderate 
hepatic impairment while no data are available in participants with severe hepatic impairment.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
A tool molecule was well tolerated in general toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys, but the results 
of these studies conducted with normal healthy monkeys have limited translatability to multiple 
myeloma patients.
Carcinogenicity and mutagenicity
No animal studies have been performed to assess the carcinogenic or genotoxic potential of 
talquetamab.
Reproductive toxicology and fertility
No animal studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of talquetamab on reproduction and 
foetal development. No studies have been conducted to evaluate the effects of talquetamab on fertility.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What Talvey is and what it is used for
Talvey is a cancer medicine that contains the active substance talquetamab. Talquetamab is an 
antibody, a type of protein that recognises and attaches to specific targets in your body. It has been 
designed to attach to the protien GPRC5D (G Protein-coupled receptor family C group 5 member D), 
which is found on multiple myeloma cancer cells, and to CD3, a protein on T cells (a type of white 
blood cell). T cells are a part of the body’s natural defences and help protect the body from infection. 
They can also destroy cancer cells. When this medicine attaches to these cells, it brings the cancer 
cells and T cells together. This encourages the T cells to destroy the multiple myeloma cancer cells.
Talvey is used to treat adults with multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow.
It is used when patients have had at least three other types of treatment that have not worked or have 
stopped working.
2. What you need to know before you are given Talvey
You must not be given Talvey

if you are allergic to talquetamab or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).
Do not use Talvey if the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or nurse before 
you are given Talvey.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Talvey.

Serious side effects
There are serious side effects that may occur after you start taking Talvey. You need to tell your 
doctor or nurse straight away if these occur, as they may require that you get immediate medical 
attention.
Tell your doctor or nurse right away if you experience any of the following:

signs of a condition known as ‘cytokine release syndrome’ (CRS). CRS is a serious immune 
reaction with symptoms such as fever, low blood pressure, chills, difficulty breathing, fatigue, 
headache, fast heart beat and increased level of liver enzymes in the blood.
effects on your nervous system. Symptoms include feeling confused, feeling disoriented, feeling 
sleepy, feeling less alert, slow or difficulty thinking, altered thinking or decreased conciousness, 
confusion, difficulty speaking and understanding speech. Some of these may be signs of a 
serious immune reaction called ‘immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome’ 
(ICANS).
problems with the mouth, such as a loss of taste, dry mouth, difficulty swallowing and 
inflammation of the lining of the mouth.
skin problems such as rash, redness and nail problems.
feeling warm, fever, chills or shivering, sore throat or mouth ulcers may be signs of an 
infection.




Talvey and vaccines
Talk to your doctor or nurse before you are given Talvey if you have had a recent vaccination or are 
going to have a vaccination. Your immune system (the body’s natural defences) may not respond as 
well to vaccination when you are taking this medicine.
You should not receive live vaccines, a specific type of vaccine, from at least 4 weeks before starting 
your treatment with Talvey until at least 4 weeks after you have taken your last dose.
Tests and checks
Before you are given Talvey your doctor will check your blood to look at the levels of different blood 
cells and to test for signs of infection. Infections will be treated before you start taking this medicine.
After you have Talvey your doctor will monitor you for side effects. They will also regularly check 
your blood counts, as the number of blood cells and other blood components may decrease when you 
use this medicine.
Children and adolescents
Talvey should not be used in children or young people below 18 years of age, because the medicine 
has not been studied in this age group and it is not known how this medicine will affect them.
Other medicines and Talvey
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines. 
This includes medicines you can get without a prescription and herbal medicines.
Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding
Pregnancy and contraception
Talvey has the potential to be transmitted from the mother to the developing foetus. The effects of 
Talvey on the developing foetus are unknown and a risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded.
If you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your doctor or 
nurse for advice before you are given this medicine.
If you become pregnant while being treated with this medicine, tell your doctor or nurse straight away.
If you could become pregnant, you must use effective contraception during treatment and for 3 months 
after stopping treatment with Talvey. Your doctor will check if you are pregnant before starting 
treatment.
39
If your partner becomes pregnant while you are taking this medicine, tell your doctor straight away.
If you have taken this medicine during pregnancy, your newborn baby should not be given any live 
vaccines until he or she is at least four weeks old.
Breast-feeding
It is not known if Talvey passes into breast milk. There may be a risk to breastfed newborns/infants. 
Ask your doctor for advice before starting this medicine. You and your doctor will decide if the 
benefit of breast-feeding is greater than the risk to your baby. If you and your doctor decide to stop 
taking this medicine, you should not breast-feed for 3 months after stopping treatment.
Driving and using machines
Some people may feel tired, dizzy, or confused while taking Talvey. Do not drive, use tools or 
machines from recieving your first dose until at least 48 hours after receiving your first treatment dose 
of Talvey or as instructed by your doctor.
Talvey contains sodium
Talvey contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-free’.
3.
How Talvey is given
How much is given
Talvey will be given to you under supervision by a doctor experienced in treating patients with 
multiple myeloma. Your doctor will decide how much Talvey you are given. The dose of Talvey will

2-4 days after your second dose.
After your third dose, you will then receive a ‘Treatment dose’ once a week thereafter.
Treatment will continue for as long as you benefit from having Talvey.
Your doctor will monitor you for side effects after each of your first three doses. They will do this for 
2 days after each dose. You should stay close to a healthcare facility after each of the first three doses 
in case you have side effects.
If you experience side effects after any of your first two doses, your doctor may decide to wait up to 7 
days before giving you your next dose.

The decision to use either the 0.4 mg/kg once weekly or 0.8 mg/kg every two weeks should be made 
in consultation with your doctor.
How the medicine is given
Talvey will be given to you by a doctor or nurse as an injection under your skin (‘subcutaneous’ 
injection). It is given in the stomach area (abdomen) or thigh.
Medicines given during treatment with Talvey
Before the first three doses (if you are given 0.4 mg/kg bodyweight) or the first four doses (if you are 
given 0.8 mg/kg bodyweight) of Talvey, you will be given medicines which help to lower the chance 
of side effects. These may include:



medicines to reduce an allergic reaction (antihistamines)
medicines to reduce inflammation (corticosteroids)
medicines to reduce fever (such as paracetamol)
You may also be given these medicines for when you take later doses of Talvey based on any 
symptoms you have.
You may also be given additional medicines based on any symptoms you experience or your medical 
history.
If you are given more Talvey than you should
This medicine will be given by your doctor or nurse. In the event that you are given too much (an 
overdose) your doctor will check you for side effects.
If you forget your appointment to have Talvey

Check that the Talvey solution for injection is colourless to light yellow. Do not use if the 
solution is discoloured, cloudy, or if foreign particles are present.
Remove the appropriate strength Talvey vial from refrigerated storage (2°C to 8°C) and 
equilibrate to ambient temperature (15°C to 30°C) for at least 15 minutes. Do not warm Talvey
vial in any other way.
Once equilibrated, gently swirl the vial for approximately 10 seconds to mix. Do not shake.
Withdraw the required injection volume of Talvey from the vial(s) into an appropriately sized 
syringe using a transfer needle.
o
Each injection volume should not exceed 2.0 mL. Divide doses requiring greater than 
2.0 mL equally into multiple syringes.
Talvey is compatible with stainless steel injection needles and polypropylene or polycarbonate 
syringe material.
Replace the transfer needle with an appropriately sized needle for injection.

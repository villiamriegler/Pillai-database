Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for METFORMIN, 
SAXAGLIPTIN, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Based on the review of cases in the saxagliptin PSUSA covering the reporting period 31 July 2013 
to 30 July 2014 (EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00002685/201407), the PRAC requested the MAH to add 
“constipation” to section 4.8 of the saxagliptin SmPC with a frequency of “not known”. The PRAC 
considered that the product information of the saxagliptin/metformin fixed dose combination should 
be updated accordingly.  
Therefore, in view of available data regarding constipation, the PRAC considered that changes to 
the product information were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC.

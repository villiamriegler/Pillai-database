Scientific conclusions 
Taking  into  account  the  PRAC  Assessment  Report  on  the  PSUR(s)  for  semaglutide,  the  scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In  view  of  the  available  data  on  dysgeusia  from  clinical  trials  and  spontaneous  reports,  the  PRAC 
considers  a  causal  relationship  between  semaglutide  p.o.  (Rybelsus)  and  dysgeusia  is  at  least  a 
reasonable  possibility.  The  PRAC  concluded  that  the  product  information  of  products  containing  oral 
semaglutide (Rybelsus) should be amended accordingly. 
In view of the available data on delayed gastric emptying from clinical trials, the PRAC considers a causal 
relationship between semaglutide (Ozempic, Rybelsus and Wegovy) and delayed gastric emptying is at 
least a reasonable possibility. The PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing 
semaglutide should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for semaglutide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance  of  the  medicinal  product(s)  containing  semaglutide  is  unchanged  subject  to  the  proposed 
changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
Myclausen 500 mg film-coated tablets 
2.  QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION 
Each film-coated tablet contains 500 mg mycophenolate mofetil. 
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1. 
3. 
PHARMACEUTICAL FORM 
Film-coated tablet 
White round film-coated tablets. 
4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Myclausen is indicated in combination with ciclosporin and corticosteroids for the prophylaxis of 
acute transplant rejection in patients receiving allogeneic renal, cardiac or hepatic transplants. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated and maintained by appropriately qualified transplant specialists. 
Posology 
Use in renal transplant 
Adults 
Treatment should be initiated within 72 hours following transplantation. The recommended dose in 
renal transplant patients is 1 g administered twice daily (2 g daily dose). 
Paediatric population aged 2 to 18 years 
The recommended dose of mycophenolate mofetil is 600 mg/m2
a maximum of 2 g daily). Tablets should only be prescribed to patients with a body surface area 
greater than 1.5 m2, at a dose of 1 g twice daily (2 g daily dose). As some adverse reactions occur with 
greater frequency in this age group (see section 4.8) compared with adults, temporary dose reduction 
or interruption may be required; these will need to take into account relevant clinical factors including 
severity of reaction. 
administered orally twice daily (up to 
Paediatric population < 2 years 
There are limited safety and efficacy data in children below the age of 2 years. These are insufficient 
to make dosage recommendations and therefore use in this age group is not recommended. 
Use in cardiac transplant 
Adults 
Treatment should be initiated within 5 days following transplantation. The recommended dose in 
cardiac transplant patients is 1.5 g administered twice daily (3 g daily dose). 
Paediatric population 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No data are available for paediatric cardiac transplant patients. 
Use in hepatic transplant 
Adults 
Intravenous  (IV) mycophenolate mofetil should be administered for the first 4 days following hepatic 
transplant, with oral Myclausen initiated as soon after this as it can be tolerated. The recommended 
oral dose in hepatic transplant patients is 1.5 g administered twice daily (3 g daily dose). 
Paediatric population 
No data are available for paediatric hepatic transplant patients. 
Use in special populations 
Elderly 
The recommended dose of 1 g administered twice a day for renal transplant patients and 1.5 g twice a 
day for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients is appropriate for the elderly. 
Renal impairment 
In renal transplant patients with severe chronic renal impairment (glomerular filtration 
rate < 25 mL/min/1.73 m2), outside the immediate post-transplant period, doses greater than 1 g 
administered twice a day should be avoided. These patients should also be carefully observed. No dose 
adjustments are needed in patients experiencing delayed renal graft function post-operatively (see 
section 5.2). No data are available for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients with severe chronic renal 
impairment. 
Severe hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustments are needed for renal transplant patients with severe hepatic parenchymal disease. 
No data are available for cardiac transplant patients with severe hepatic parenchymal disease. 
Treatment during rejection episodes 
Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil. Renal transplant 
rejection does not lead to changes in MPA pharmacokinetics; dosage reduction or interruption of 
Myclausen is not required. There is no basis for Myclausen dose adjustment following cardiac 
transplant rejection. No pharmacokinetic data are available during hepatic transplant rejection. 
Paediatric population 
No data are available for treatment of first or refractory rejection in paediatric transplant patients. 
Method of administration 
For oral use. The film-coated tablets should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. 
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product. 
Because mycophenolate mofetil has demonstrated teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits, film-coated 
tablets should not be broken or crushed. 
4.3  Contraindications 
•  Myclausen should not be given to patients with hypersensitivity to mycophenolate mofetil, 
mycophenolic acid or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Hypersensitivity reactions to mycophenolate mofetil have been observed (see section 4.8). 
•  Myclausen should not be given to women of childbearing potential who are not using highly 
effective contraception (see section 4.6). 
•  Myclausen treatment should not be initiated in women of child bearing potential without 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
providing a pregnancy test result to rule out unintended use in pregnancy (see section 4.6). 
•  Myclausen should not be used during pregnancy unless there is no suitable alternative treatment 
to prevent transplant rejection (see section 4.6). 
•  Myclausen should not be given to women who are breast-feeding (see section 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Neoplasms 
Patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products, 
including Myclausen, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, 
particularly of the skin (see section 4.8). The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of 
immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. As general advice to minimise the risk 
for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing 
and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 
Infections 
Patients treated with immunosuppressants, including Myclausen, are at increased risk for opportunistic 
infections (bacterial, fungal, viral and protozoal), fatal infections and sepsis (see section 4.8). Such 
infections include latent viral reactivation, such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C reactivation and infections 
caused by polyomaviruses (BK virus-associated nephropathy, JC virus-associated progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy PML). Cases of hepatitis due to reactivation of hepatitis B or hepatitis 
C have been reported in carrier patients treated with immunosuppressants. These infections are often 
related to a high total immunosuppressive burden and may lead to serious or fatal conditions that 
physicians should consider in the differential diagnosis in immunosuppressed patients with 
deteriorating renal function or neurological symptoms. Mycophenolic acid has a cytostatic effect on B- 
and T-lymphocytes, therefore an increased severity of COVID-19 may occur, and appropriate clinical 
action should be considered. 
There have been reports of hypogammaglobulinaemia in association with recurrent infections in 
patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressants. In some of 
these cases switching mycophenolate mofetil to an alternative immunosuppressant resulted in serum 
IgG levels returning to normal. Patients on Myclausen who develop recurrent infections should have 
their serum immunoglobulins measured. In cases of sustained, clinically relevant 
hypogammaglobulinaemia, appropriate clinical action should be considered taking into account the 
potent cytostatic effects that mycophenolic acid has on T- and B-lymphocytes. 
There have been published reports of bronchiectasis in adults and children who received 
mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressants. In some of these cases 
switching mycophenolate mofetil to another immunosuppressant resulted in improvement in 
respiratory symptoms. The risk of bronchiectasis may be linked to hypogammaglobulinaemia or to a 
direct effect on the lung. There have also been isolated reports of interstitial lung disease and 
pulmonary fibrosis, some of which were fatal (see section 4.8). It is recommended that patients who 
develop persistent pulmonary symptoms, such as cough and dyspnoea, are investigated. 
Blood and immune system 
Patients receiving Myclausen should be monitored for neutropenia, which may be related to 
Myclausen itself, concomitant medications, viral infections, or some combination of these causes. 
Patients taking Myclausen should have complete blood counts weekly during the first month, twice 
monthly for the second and third months of treatment, then monthly through the first year. If 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
neutropenia develops (absolute neutrophil count < 1.3 x 103/µl), it may be appropriate to interrupt or 
discontinue Myclausen. 
Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate 
mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressants. The mechanism for mycophenolate mofetil 
induced PRCA is unknown. PRCA may resolve with dose reduction or cessation of Myclausen 
therapy. Changes to Myclausen therapy should only be undertaken under appropriate supervision in 
transplant recipients in order to minimise the risk of graft rejection (see section 4.8). 
Patients receiving Myclausen should be instructed to report immediately any evidence of infection, 
unexpected bruising, bleeding or any other manifestation of bone marrow failure. 
Patients should be advised that, during treatment with Myclausen, vaccinations may be less effective, 
and the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided (see section 4.5). Influenza vaccination may 
be of value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination. 
Gastro-intestinal 
Mycophenolate mofetil has been associated with an increased incidence of digestive system adverse 
events, including infrequent cases of gastrointestinal tract ulceration, haemorrhage and perforation, 
Myclausen should be administered with caution in patients with active serious digestive system 
disease. 
Mycophenolate mofetil is an IMPDH (inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase) inhibitor. Therefore, it 
should be avoided in patients with rare hereditary deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine 
phosphoribosyl-transferase (HGPRT) such as Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome. 
Interactions 
Caution should be exercised when switching combination therapy from regimens containing 
immunosuppressants, which interfere with MPA enterohepatic recirculation, e.g. ciclosporin, to others 
devoid of this effect, e.g. tacrolimus, sirolimus, belatacept, or vice versa, as this might result in 
changes of MPA exposure. Drugs which interfere with MPA’s enterohepatic cycle (e.g. 
cholestyramine, antibiotics) should be used with caution due to their potential to reduce the plasma 
level and efficacy of Myclausen (see also section 4.5). Therapeutic drug monitoring of MPA may be 
appropriate when switching combination therapy (e.g. from ciclosporin to tacrolimus or vice versa) or 
to ensure adequate immunosuppression in patients with high immunological risk (e.g. risk of rejection, 
treatment with antibiotics, addition or removal of an interacting medication). 
It is recommended that Myclausen should not be administered concomitantly with azathioprine 
because such concomitant administration has not been studied. 
The risk/benefit ratio of mycophenolate mofetil in combination with sirolimus has not been 
established (see also section 4.5). 
Special populations 
Elderly patients may be at an increased risk of adverse events such as certain infections (including 
cytomegalovirus tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal haemorrhage and pulmonary 
oedema, compared with younger individuals (see section 4.8). 
Teratogenic effects 
Mycophenolate is a powerful human teratogen. Spontaneous abortion (rate of 45% to 49%) and 
congenital malformations (estimated rate of 23% to 27%) have been reported following MMF 
exposure during pregnancy. Therefore Myclausen is contraindicated in pregnancy unless there are no 
suitable alternative treatments to prevent transplant rejection. Female patients of childbearing potential 
should be made aware of the risks and follow the recommendations provided in section 4.6 (e.g. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
contraceptive methods, pregnancy testing) prior to, during, and after therapy with Myclausen. 
Physicians should ensure that women taking mycophenolate understand the risk of harm to the baby, 
the need for effective contraception, and the need to immediately consult their physician if there is a 
possibility of pregnancy. 
Contraception (see section 4.6) 
Because of robust clinical evidence showing a high risk of abortion and congenital malformations 
when mycophenolate mofetil is used in pregnancy, every effort to avoid pregnancy during treatment 
should be taken. Therefore, women with childbearing potential must use at least one form of reliable 
contraception (see section 4.3) before starting Myclausen therapy, during therapy, and for six weeks 
after stopping the therapy, unless abstinence is the chosen method of contraception. Two 
complementary forms of contraception simultaneously are preferred to minimise the potential for 
contraceptive failure and unintended pregnancy. 
For contraception advice for men see section 4.6. 
Educational materials 
In order to assist patients in avoiding foetal exposure to mycophenolate and to provide additional 
important safety information, the Marketing Authorisation holder will provide educational materials to 
healthcare professionals. The educational materials will reinforce the warnings about the teratogenicity 
of mycophenolate, provide advice on contraception before therapy is started and guidance on the need 
for pregnancy testing. Full patient information about the teratogenic risk and the pregnancy prevention 
measures should be given by the physician to women of childbearing potential and, as appropriate, to 
male patients.  
Additional precautions 
Patients should not donate blood during therapy or for at least 6 weeks following discontinuation of 
mycophenolate. Men should not donate semen during therapy or for 90 days following discontinuation 
of mycophenolate. 
Sodium contents 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium- free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Aciclovir 
Higher aciclovir plasma concentrations were observed when mycophenolate mofetil was administered 
with aciclovir in comparison to the administration of aciclovir alone. The changes in MPAG (the 
phenolic glucuronide of MPA) pharmacokinetics (MPAG increased by 8 %) were minimal and are not 
considered clinically significant. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence 
of renal impairment, as are aciclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate mofetil and 
aciclovir, or its prodrugs, e.g. valaciclovir, to compete for tubular secretion and further increases in 
concentrations of both substances may occur. 
Antacids and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) 
Decreased MPA exposure has been observed when antacids, such as magnesium and aluminium 
hydroxides, and PPIs, including lansoprazole and pantoprazole, were administered with 
mycophenolate mofetil. When comparing rates of transplant rejection or rates of graft loss between 
mycophenolate mofetil patients taking PPIs versus mycophenolate mofetil patients not taking PPIs, no 
significant differences were seen. These data support extrapolation of this finding to all antacids 
because the reduction in exposure when mycophenolate mofetil was co- administered with magnesium 
and aluminium hydroxides is considerably less than when mycophenolate mofetil was co-administered 
with PPIs. 
Medicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation (e.g. cholestyramine, ciclosporin A, 
antibiotics 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Caution should be used with medicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation because 
of their potential to reduce the efficacy of Myclausen. 
Cholestyramine 
Following single dose administration of 1.5 g of mycophenolate mofetil to normal healthy subjects 
pre-treated with 4 g TID of cholestyramine for 4 days, there was a 40 % reduction in the AUC of MPA 
(see section 4.4 and section 5.2). Caution should be used during concomitant administration because 
of the potential to reduce efficacy of Myclausen. 
Ciclosporin A 
Ciclosporin A (CsA) pharmacokinetics are unaffected by mycophenolate mofetil. In contrast, if 
concomitant CsA treatment is stopped, an increase in MPA AUC of around 30 % should be expected. 
CsA interferes with MPA enterohepatic recycling, resulting in reduced MPA exposures by 30 - 50 % 
in renal transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil and CsA compared with patients 
receiving sirolimus or belatacept and similar doses of mycophenolate mofetil (see also section 4.4). 
Conversely, changes of MPA exposure should be expected when switching patients from CsA to one 
of the immunosuppressants which does not interfere with MPA´s enterohepatic cycle. 
Antibiotics eliminating β-glucuronidase-producing bacteria in the intestine (e.g. aminoglycoside, 
cephalosporin, fluoroquinolone, and penicillin classes of antibiotics) may interfere with MPAG/MPA 
enterohepatic recirculation, thus leading to reduced systemic MPA exposure. Information concerning 
the following antibiotics is available: 
Ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 
Reductions in pre-dose (trough) MPA concentrations of about 50% have been reported in renal 
transplant recipients in the days immediately following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or 
amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. This effect tended to diminish with continued antibiotic use and to 
cease within a few days of antibiotic discontinuation. The change in pre-dose level may not accurately 
represent changes in overall MPA exposure. Therefore, a change in the dose of Myclausen should not 
normally be necessary in the absence of clinical evidence of graft dysfunction. However, close clinical 
monitoring should be performed during the combination and shortly after antibiotic treatment. 
Norfloxacin and metronidazole 
In healthy volunteers, no significant interaction was observed when mycophenolate mofetil was 
concomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. However, norfloxacin and 
metronidazole combined reduced the MPA exposure by approximately 30% following a single dose of 
mycophenolate mofetil. 
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 
No effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed. 
Medicinal products that affect glucuronidation (e.g. isavuconazole, telmisartan) 
Concomitant administration of drugs affecting glucuronidation of MPA may change MPA exposure. 
Caution is therefore recommended when administering these drugs concomitantly with Myclausen. 
Isavuconazole 
An increase of MPA exposure (AUC0-∞) by 35% was observed with concomitant administration of 
isavuconazole. 
Telmisartan 
Concomitant administration of telmisartan and mycophenolate mofetil resulted in an approximately 
30 % decrease of MPA concentrations. Telmisartan changes MPA’s elimination by enhancing 
PPAR gamma (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) expression, which in turn results in 
an enhanced uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase isoform 1A9 (UGT1A9) expression and 
activity. When comparing rates of transplant rejection, rates of graft loss or adverse event profiles 
between mycophenolate mofetil patients with and without concomitant telmisartan medication, no 
clinical consequences of the pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction were seen. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ganciclovir 
Based on the results of a single dose administration study of recommended doses of oral 
mycophenolate and IV ganciclovir and the known effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics 
of mycophenolate mofetil (see section 4.2) and ganciclovir, it is anticipated that co-administration of 
these agents (which compete for mechanisms of renal tubular secretion) will result in increases in 
MPAG and ganciclovir concentration. No substantial alteration of MPA pharmacokinetics is 
anticipated and Myclausen dose adjustment is not required. In patients with renal impairment in whom 
Myclausen and ganciclovir or its prodrugs, e.g. valganciclovir, are co-administered, the dose 
recommendations for ganciclovir should be observed and patients should be monitored carefully. 
Oral contraceptives 
The pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives were not affected to a clinically 
relevant degree by coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (see also section 5.2). 
Rifampicin 
In patients not also taking ciclosporin, concomitant administration of mycophenolate mofetil and 
rifampicin resulted in a decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0-12 h) of 18 % to 70 %. It is recommended 
to monitor MPA exposure levels and to adjust Myclausen doses accordingly to maintain clinical 
efficacy when rifampicin is administered concomitantly. 
Sevelamer 
Decrease in MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 30 % and 25 %, respectively, were observed when 
mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with sevelamer without any clinical 
consequences (i.e. graft rejection). It is recommended, however, to administer Myclausen at least one 
hour before or three hours after sevelamer intake to minimise the impact on the absorption of MPA. 
There are no data on mycophenolate mofetil with phosphate binders other than sevelamer. 
Tacrolimus 
In hepatic transplant patients initiated on mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus, the AUC and Cmax 
of MPA, the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil, were not significantly affected by co-
administration with tacrolimus. In contrast, there was an increase of approximately 20 % in tacrolimus 
AUC when multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g BID) were administered to hepatic 
transplant patients taking tacrolimus. However, in renal transplant patients, tacrolimus concentration 
did not appear to be altered by mycophenolate mofetil (see also section 4.4). 
Live vaccines 
Live vaccines should not be given to patients with an impaired immune response. The antibody 
response to other vaccines may be diminished (see also section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
Potential interaction 
Co-administration of probenecid with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys raises plasma AUC of 
MPAG by 3-fold. Thus, other substances known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with 
MPAG, and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other substance undergoing tubular 
secretion. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Pregnancy whilst taking mycophenolate must be avoided. Therefore, women of childbearing potential 
must use at least one form of reliable contraception (see section 4.3) before starting Myclausen 
therapy, during therapy, and for six weeks after stopping the therapy, unless abstinence is the chosen 
method of contraception. Two complementary forms of contraception simultaneously are preferred. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy 
Myclausen is contraindicated during pregnancy unless there is no suitable alternative treatment to 
prevent transplant rejection. Treatment should not be initiated without providing a negative pregnancy 
test result to rule out unintended use in pregnancy (see section 4.3). 
Female patients of reproductive potential must be made aware of the increased risk of pregnancy loss 
and congenital malformations at the beginning of the treatment and must be counselled regarding 
pregnancy prevention and planning. 
Before starting Myclausen treatment, women of child bearing potential should have two negative 
serum or urine pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL  in order to exclude unintended 
exposure of an embryo to mycophenolate. It is recommended that the second test should be performed 
8 – 10 days after the first test. For transplants from deceased donors, if it is not possible to perform 
two tests 8 – 10 days apart before treatment starts (because of the timing of transplant organ 
availability), a pregnancy test must be performed immediately before starting treatment and a further 
test 8 – 10 days later. Pregnancy tests should be repeated as clinically required (e.g. after any gap in 
contraception is reported). Results of all pregnancy tests should be discussed with the patient. Patients 
should be instructed to consult their physician immediately should pregnancy occur. 
Mycophenolate is a powerful human teratogen, with an increased risk of spontaneous abortions and 
congenital malformations in case of exposure during pregnancy; 
• 
Spontaneous abortions have been reported in 45 to 49% of pregnant women exposed to 
mycophenolate mofetil, compared to a reported rate of between 12 and 33% in solid organ 
transplant patients treated with immunosuppressants other than mycophenolate mofetil. 
•  Based on literature reports, malformations occurred in 23 to 27% of live births in women exposed 
to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (compared to 2 to 3 % of live births in the overall 
population and approximately 4 to 5% of live births in solid organ transplant recipients treated 
with immunosuppressants other than mycophenolate mofetil). 
Congenital malformations, including reports of multiple malformations, have been observed post-
marketing in children of patients exposed to Myclausen during pregnancy in combination with other 
immunosuppressants. The following malformations were most frequently reported:  
•  Abnormalities of the ear (e.g. abnormally formed or absent external ear), external auditory canal 
atresia (middle ear); 
Facial malformations such as cleft lip, cleft palate, micrognathia and hypertelorism of the orbits; 
• 
•  Abnormalities of the eye (e.g. coloboma); 
•  Congenital heart disease such as atrial and ventricular septal defects; 
•  Malformations of the fingers (e.g. polydactyly, syndactyly); 
•  Tracheo-oesophageal malformations (e.g. oesophageal atresia);  
•  Nervous system malformations such as spina bifida;  
•  Renal abnormalities. 
In addition, there have been isolated reports of the following malformations: 
•  Microphthalmia; 
• 
• 
• 
congenital choroid plexus cyst; 
septum pellucidum agenesis; 
olfactory nerve agenesis. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  
Breast-feeding 
Mycophenolate mofetil has been shown to be excreted in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known 
whether this substance is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse 
reactions to mycophenolate mofetil in breast-fed infants, Myclausen is contraindicated in nursing 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mothers (see section 4.3). 
Men 
The limited clinical evidence available does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or 
miscarriage following paternal exposure to mycophenolate mofetil. 
MPA is a powerful teratogen. It is not known if MPA is present in semen. Calculations based on 
animal data show that the maximum amount of MPA that could potentially be transferred to woman is 
so low that it would be unlikely to have an effect. Mycophenolate has been shown to be genotoxic in 
animal studies at concentrations exceeding the human therapeutic exposures only by small margins 
such that the risk of genotoxic effects on sperm cells cannot completely be excluded. 
Therefore, the following precautionary measures are recommended: sexually active male patients or 
their female partners are recommended to use reliable contraception during treatment of the male 
patient and for at least 90 days after cessation of mycophenolate mofetil. Male patients of reproductive 
potential should be made aware of and discuss with a qualified healthcare professional the potential 
risk of fathering a child. 
Fertility 
Mycophenolate mofetil had no effect on fertility of male rats at oral doses up to 20 mg/kg/day. The 
systemic exposure at this dose represents 2 – 3 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical 
dose of 2 g/day in renal transplant patients and 1.3 – 2 times the clinical exposure at the recommended 
clinical dose of 3 g/day in cardiac transplant patients. In a female fertility and reproduction study 
conducted in rats, oral doses of 4.5 mg/kg/day caused malformations (including anophthalmia, 
agnathia, and hydrocephaly) in the first generation offspring in the absence of maternal toxicity. The 
systemic exposure at this dose was approximately 0.5 times the clinical exposure at the recommended 
clinical dose of 2 g/day for renal transplant patients and approximately 0.3 times the clinical exposure 
at the recommended clinical dose of 3 g/day for cardiac transplant patients. No effects on fertility or 
reproductive parameters were evident in the dams or in the subsequent generation. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Mycophenolate mofetil has a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Mycophenolate mofetil may cause somnolence, confusion, dizziness, tremor or hypotension, and 
therefore patients are advised to use caution when driving or using machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Diarrhoea (up to 52.6%), leukopenia (up to 45.8%), bacterial infections (up to 39.9%)and vomiting 
(up to 39.1%) were among the most common and/or serious adverse drug reactions associated with the 
administration of mycophenolate mofetil in combination with ciclosporin and corticosteroids. There is 
evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections (see section 4.4). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The adverse reactions from clinical trials and post-marketing experience are listed in Table 1, by 
MedDRA system organ class (SOC) along with their frequencies. The corresponding frequency 
category for each adverse reaction is based on the following convention: very common (≥1/10), 
common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) and very 
rare (<1/10,000). Due to the large differences observed in the frequency of certain adverse reactions 
across the different transplant indications, the frequency is presented separately for renal, hepatic and 
cardiac transplant patients.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Malignancies 
Patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products, 
including mycophenolate mofetil, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other 
malignancies, particularly of the skin (see section 4.4). Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac 
transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 
1-year data. Hepatic transplant patients were followed for at least 1 year, but less than 3 years. 
Infections 
All patients treated with immunosuppressants are at increased risk of bacterial, viral and fungal 
infections (some of which may lead to a fatal outcome), including those caused by opportunistic 
agents and latent viral reactivation. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see 
section 4.4). The most serious infections were sepsis, peritonitis, meningitis, endocarditis, tuberculosis 
and atypical mycobacterial infection. The most common opportunistic infections in patients receiving 
mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressants in controlled clinical trials in 
renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year were candida mucocutaneous, 
CMV viraemia/syndrome and Herpes simplex. The proportion of patients with CMV 
viraemia/syndrome was 13.5%. Cases of BK virus associated nephropathy, as well as cases of JC virus 
associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), have been reported in patients treated 
with immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil. 
Blood and lymphatic disorders 
Cytopenias, including leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia, are known risks 
associated with mycophenolate mofetil and may lead or contribute to the occurrence of infections and 
hemorrhages (see section 4.4). Agranulocytosis and neutropenia have been reported; therefore, regular 
monitoring of patients taking mycophenolate mofetil is advised (see section 4.4). There have been 
reports of aplastic anaemia and bone marrow failure in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil, 
some of which have been fatal. Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treated with mycophenolate mofetil (see section 4.4). 
Isolated cases of abnormal neutrophil morphology, including the acquired Pelger-Huet anomaly, have 
been observed in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. These changes are not associated with 
impaired neutrophil function. These changes may suggest a ‘left shift’ in the maturity of neutrophils in 
haematological investigations, which may be mistakenly interpreted as a sign of infection in 
immunosuppressed patients such as those that receive mycophenolate mofetil. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
The most serious gastrointestinal disorders were ulceration and hemorrhage which are known risks 
associated with mycophenolate mofetil. Mouth, esophageal, gastric, duodenal, and intestinal ulcers 
often complicated by hemorrhage, as well as hematemesis, melena, and hemorrhagic forms of gastritis 
and colitis were commonly reported during the pivotal clinical trials. The most common 
gastrointestinal disorders, however, were diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Endoscopic investigation of 
patients with mycophenolate mofetil-related diarrhea have revealed isolated cases of intestinal villous 
atrophy (see section 4.4). 
Hypersensitivity 
Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioneurotic oedema and anaphylactic reaction have been 
reported. 
Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions 
Cases of spontaneous abortion have been reported in patients exposed to mycophenolate mofetil, 
mainly in the first trimester, see section 4.6. 
Congenital disorders 
Congenital malformations have been observed post-marketing in children of patients exposed to 
mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressants, see section 4.6. 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
There have been isolated reports of interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis in patients treated 
with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressants, some of which have been 
fatal. There have also been reports of bronchiectasis in children and adults. 
Immune system disorders 
Hypogammaglobulinaemia has been reported in patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil in 
combination with other immunosuppressants. 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
Oedema, including peripheral, face and scrotal edema, was reported very commonly during the pivotal 
trials. Musculoskeletal pain such as myalgia, and neck and back pain were also very commonly 
reported. 
De novo purine synthesis inhibitors-associated acute inflammatory syndrome has been described from 
post-marketing experience as a paradoxical proinflammatory reaction associated with mycophenolate 
mofetil and mycophenolic acid, characterised by fever, arthralgia, arthritis, muscle pain and elevated 
inflammatory markers. Literature case reports showed rapid improvement following discontinuation of 
the medicinal product. 
Special populations 
Paediatric population 
The type and frequency of adverse reactions in a clinical study, which recruited 92 paediatric patients 
aged 2 to 18 years who were given 600 mg/m2 mycophenolate mofetil orally twice daily, were 
generally similar to those observed in adult patients given 1 g mycophenolate mofetil twice daily. 
However, the following treatment-related adverse events were more frequent in the paediatric 
population, particularly in children under 6 years of age, when compared to adults: diarrhoea, sepsis, 
leukopenia, anaemia and infection. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elderly 
Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) may generally be at increased risk of adverse reactions due to 
immunosuppression. Elderly patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil as part of a combination 
immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus 
tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal haemorrhage and pulmonary oedema, compared 
to younger individuals. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Reports of overdoses with mycophenolate mofetil have been received from clinical trials and during 
post-marketing experience. In many of these cases, no adverse events were reported. In those overdose 
cases in which adverse events were reported, the events fall within the known safety profile of the 
medicinal product. 
It is expected that an overdose of mycophenolate mofetil could possibly result in oversuppression of 
the immune system and increase susceptibility to infections and bone marrow suppression (see 
section 4.4). If neutropenia develops, dosing with Myclausen should be interrupted or the dose 
reduced (see section 4.4). 
Haemodialysis would not be expected to remove clinically significant amounts of MPA or MPAG. 
Bile acid sequestrants, such as cholestyramine, can remove MPA by decreasing the enterohepatic re-
circulation of the drug (see section 5.2). 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: immunosuppressive agents, ATC code: L04AA06 
Mechanism of action 
Mycophenolate mofetil is the 2-morpholinoethyl ester of MPA. MPA is a selective, uncompetitive and 
reversible inhibitor of IMPDH, and therefore inhibits the de novo pathway of guanosine nucleotide 
synthesis without incorporation into DNA. Because T- and B-lymphocytes are critically dependent for 
their proliferation on de novo synthesis of purines whereas other cell types can utilise salvage 
pathways, MPA has more potent cytostatic effects on lymphocytes than on other cells.  
In addition to its inhibition of IMPDH and the resulting deprivation of lymphocytes, MPA also 
influences cellular checkpoints responsible for metabolic programming of lymphocytes. It  has been 
shown, using human CD4+ T-cells,  that MPA shifts transcriptional activities in lymphocytes from a 
proliferative state to catabolic processes relevant to metabolism and survival leading to an anergic 
state of T-cells, whereby the cells become unresponsive to their specific antigen. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following oral administration, mycophenolate mofetil undergoes rapid and extensive absorption and 
complete presystemic metabolism to the active metabolite, MPA. As evidenced by suppression of 
acute rejection following renal transplantation, the immunosuppressant activity of mycophenolate 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
mofetil is correlated with MPA concentration. The mean bioavailability of oral mycophenolate 
mofetil, based on MPA AUC, is 94 % relative to IV mycophenolate mofetil. Food had no effect on the 
extent of absorption (MPA AUC) of mycophenolate mofetil when administered at doses of 1.5 g BID 
to renal transplant patients. However, MPA Cmax was decreased by 40 % in the presence of food. 
Mycophenolate mofetil is not measurable systemically in plasma following oral administration. 
Distribution 
As a result of enterohepatic recirculation, secondary increases in plasma MPA concentration are 
usually observed at approximately 6-12 hours post-dose. A reduction in the AUC of MPA of 
approximately 40 % is associated with the co-administration of cholestyramine (4 g TID), indicating 
that there is a significant amount of enterohepatic recirculation. 
MPA at clinically relevant concentrations is 97 % bound to plasma albumin. 
In the early post-transplant period (< 40 days post-transplant), renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant 
patients had mean MPA AUCs approximately 30% lower and Cmax approximately 40% lower 
compared to the late post-transplant period (3 - 6 months post-transplant). 
Biotransformation 
MPA is metabolised principally by glucuronyl transferase (isoform UGT1A9) to form the inactive 
phenolic glucuronide of MPA (MPAG). In vivo, MPAG is converted back to free MPA via 
enterohepatic recirculation. A minor acylglucuronide (AcMPAG) is also formed. AcMPAG is 
pharmacologically active and is suspected to be responsible for some of MMF´s side effects 
(diarrhoea, leukopenia). 
Elimination 
A negligible amount of substance is excreted as MPA (< 1 % of the dose) in the urine. Oral 
administration of radiolabelled mycophenolate mofetil results in complete recovery of the 
administered dose with 93 % of the administered dose recovered in the urine and 6 % recovered in the 
faeces. Most (about 87 %) of the administered dose is excreted in the urine as MPAG. 
At clinically encountered concentrations, MPA and MPAG are not removed by haemodialysis. 
However, at high MPAG plasma concentrations (> 100 µg/mL), small amounts of MPAG are 
removed. 
By interfering with enterohepatic recirculation of the drug, bile acid sequestrants such as 
cholestyramine, reduce MPA AUC (see section 4.9). 
MPA’s disposition depends on several transporters. Organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) 
and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) are involved in MPA’s disposition; OATP 
isoforms, MRP2 and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) are transporters associated with the 
glucuronides’ biliary excretion. Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) is also able to transport MPA, 
but its contribution seems to be confined to the absorption process. In the kidney MPA and its 
metabolites potently interact with renal organic anion transporters. 
Enterohepatic recirculation interferes with accurate determination of MPA’s disposition parameters; 
only apparent values can be indicated. In healthy volunteers and patients with autoimmune disease 
approximate clearance values of 10.6 L/h and 8.27 L/h respectively and half-life values of 17 h were 
observed. In transplant patients mean clearance values were higher (range 11.9-34.9 L/h) and mean 
half-life values shorter (5-11 h) with little difference between renal, hepatic or cardiac transplant 
patients. In the individual patients, these elimination parameters vary based on type of co-treatment 
with other immunosuppressants, time post-transplantation, plasma albumin concentration and renal 
function. These factors explain why reduced exposure is seen when mycophenolat mofetil is co-
administered with cyclosporine (see section 4.5) and why plasma concentrations tend to increase over 
time compared to what is observed immediately after transplantation. 
Special populations 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment 
In a single dose study (6 subjects/group), mean plasma MPA AUC observed in subjects with severe 
chronic renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate < 25 mL/min/1.73 m2) were 28-75 % higher 
relative to the means observed in normal healthy subjects or subjects with lesser degrees of renal 
impairment. The mean single dose MPAG AUC was 3-6-fold higher in subjects with severe renal 
impairment than in subjects with mild renal impairment or normal healthy subjects, consistent with the 
known renal elimination of MPAG. Multiple dosing of mycophenolate mofetil in patients with severe 
chronic renal impairment has not been studied. No data are available for cardiac or hepatic transplant 
patients with severe chronic renal impairment. 
Delayed renal graft function 
In patients with delayed renal graft function post-transplant, mean MPA AUC0–12 h was comparable to 
that seen in post-transplant patients without delayed graft function. Mean plasma MPAG AUC0-12 h 
was 2-3-fold higher than in post-transplant patients without delayed graft function. There may be a 
transient increase in the free fraction and concentration of plasma MPA in patients with delayed renal 
graft function. Dose adjustment of Myclausen does not appear to be necessary. 
Hepatic impairment 
In volunteers with alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatic MPA glucuronidation processes were relatively 
unaffected by hepatic parenchymal disease. Effects of hepatic disease on these processes probably 
depend on the particular disease. Hepatic disease with predominantly biliary damage, such as primary 
biliary cirrhosis, may show a different effect. 
Paediatric population 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in 49 paediatric renal transplant patients (aged 2 to 
18 years) given 600 mg/m2 mycophenolate mofetil orally twice daily. This dose achieved MPA AUC 
values similar to those seen in adult renal transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil at a 
dose of 1 g BID in the early and late posttransplant period. MPA AUC values across age groups were 
similar in the early and late post-transplant period. 
Elderly 
The pharmacokinetic of mycophenolate mofetil and its metabolites have not been found to be altered 
in the elderly patients (≥ 65 years) when compared to younger transplant patients. 
Patients taking oral contraceptives 
A study of the co-administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g BID 
contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 
0.20 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) conducted in 18 non-transplant 
women (not taking other immunosuppressants) over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles showed no 
clinically relevant influence of mycophenolate mofetil on the ovulation suppressing action of the oral 
contraceptives. Serum levels of LH, FSH and progesterone were not significantly affected. The 
pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives were not affected to a clinically relevant degree by co-
administration of mycophenolate mofetil (see also section 4.5). 
) and combined oral 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In experimental models, mycophenolate mofetil was not tumourigenic. The highest dose tested in the 
animal carcinogenicity studies resulted in approximately 2-3 times the systemic exposure (AUC or 
Cmax) observed in renal transplant patients at the recommended clinical dose of 2 g/day and 
1.3-2 times the systemic exposure (AUC or Cmax) observed in cardiac transplant patients at the 
recommended clinical dose of 3 g/day. 
Two genotoxicity assays (in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and in vivo mouse bone marrow 
micronucleus test) showed a potential of mycophenolate mofetil to cause chromosomal aberrations. 
These effects can be related to the pharmacodynamic mode of action, i.e. inhibition of nucleotide 
synthesis in sensitive cells. Other in vitro tests for detection of gene mutation did not demonstrate 
genotoxic activity. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In teratology studies in rats and rabbits, foetal resorptions and malformations occurred in rats at 
6 mg/kg/day (including anophthalmia, agnathia, and hydrocephaly) and in rabbits at 90 mg/kg/day 
(including cardiovascular and renal anomalies, such as ectopia cordis and ectopic kidneys, and 
diaphragmatic and umbilical hernia), in the absence of maternal toxicity. The systemic exposure at 
these levels is approximately equivalent to or less than 0.5 times the clinical exposure at the 
recommended clinical dose of 2 g/day for renal transplant patients and approximately 0.3 times the 
clinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 3 g/day for cardiac transplant patients (see 
section 4.6). 
The haematopoietic and lymphoid systems were the primary organs affected in toxicology studies 
conducted with mycophenolate mofetil in the rat, mouse, dog and monkey. These effects occurred at 
systemic exposure levels that are equivalent to or less than the clinical exposure at the recommended 
dose of 2 g/day for renal transplant recipients. Gastrointestinal effects were observed in the dog at 
systemic exposure levels equivalent to or less than the clinical exposure at the recommended dose. 
Gastrointestinal and renal effects consistent with dehydration were also observed in the monkey at the 
highest dose (systemic exposure levels equivalent to or greater than clinical exposure). The nonclinical 
toxicity profile of mycophenolate mofetil appears to be consistent with adverse events observed in 
human clinical trials which now provide safety data of more relevance to the patient population (see 
section 4.8).

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Myclausen is indicated in combination with ciclosporin and corticosteroids for the prophylaxis of 
acute transplant rejection in patients receiving allogeneic renal, cardiac or hepatic transplants. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment should be initiated and maintained by appropriately qualified transplant specialists. 
Posology 
Use in renal transplant 
Adults 
Treatment should be initiated within 72 hours following transplantation. The recommended dose in 
renal transplant patients is 1 g administered twice daily (2 g daily dose). 
Paediatric population aged 2 to 18 years 
The recommended dose of mycophenolate mofetil is 600 mg/m2 administered orally twice daily (up to 
a maximum of 2 g daily). Capsules should only be prescribed to patients with a body surface area of at 
least 1.25 m2. Patients with a body surface area of 1.25 to 1.5 m2 may be prescribed mycophenolate 
mofetil capsules at a dose of 750 mg twice daily (1.5 g daily dose). Patients with a body surface area 
greater than 1.5 m2 may be prescribed mycophenolate mofetil capsules at a dose of 1 g twice daily (2 g 
daily dose). As some adverse reactions occur with greater frequency in this age group (see section 4.8) 
compared with adults, temporary dose reduction or interruption may be required; these will need to 
take into account relevant clinical factors including severity of reaction. 
Paediatric population < 2 years 
There are limited safety and efficacy data in children below the age of 2 years. These are insufficient 
to make dosage recommendations and therefore use in this age group is not recommended. 
Use in cardiac transplant 
Adults 
Treatment should be initiated within 5 days following transplantation. The recommended dose in 
cardiac transplant patients is 1.5 g administered twice daily (3 g daily dose). 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Paediatric population 
No data are available for paediatric cardiac transplant patients. 
Use in hepatic transplant 
Adults 
Intravenous (IV) mycophenolate mofetil should be administered for the first 4 days following hepatic 
transplant, with oral Myclausen initiated as soon after this as it can be tolerated. The recommended 
oral dose in hepatic transplant patients is 1.5 g administered twice daily (3 g daily dose). 
Paediatric population 
No data are available for paediatric hepatic transplant patients. 
Use in special populations 
Elderly 
The recommended dose of 1 g administered twice a day for renal transplant patients and 1.5 g twice a 
day for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients is appropriate for the elderly. 
Renal impairment 
In renal transplant patients with severe chronic renal impairment (glomerular filtration 
rate < 25 mL/min/1.73 m2), outside the immediate post-transplant period, doses greater than 1 g 
administered twice a day should be avoided. These patients should also be carefully observed. No dose 
adjustments are needed in patients experiencing delayed renal graft function post-operatively (see 
section 5.2). No data are available for cardiac or hepatic transplant patients with severe chronic renal 
impairment. 
Severe hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustments are needed for renal transplant patients with severe hepatic parenchymal disease. 
No data are available for cardiac transplant patients with severe hepatic parenchymal disease. 
Treatment during rejection episodes 
Mycophenolic acid (MPA) is the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil. Renal transplant 
rejection does not lead to changes in MPA pharmacokinetics; dosage reduction or interruption of 
Myclausen is not required. There is no basis for Myclausen dose adjustment following cardiac 
transplant rejection. No pharmacokinetic data are available during hepatic transplant rejection. 
Paediatric population 
No data are available for treatment of first or refractory rejection in paediatric transplant patients. 
Method of administration 
For oral use. The hard capsules should be swallowed whole with a glass of water. They should not be 
opened or crushed. 
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product. 
Because mycophenolate mofetil has demonstrated teratogenic effects in rats and rabbits, capsules 
should not be opened or crushed to avoid inhalation or direct contact with skin or mucous membranes 
of the powder contained in the capsules. If such contact occurs, wash thoroughly with soap and water; 
rinse eyes with plain water. 
4.3  Contraindications 
•  Myclausen should not be given to patients with hypersensitivity to mycophenolate mofetil, 
mycophenolic acid or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Hypersensitivity reactions to mycophenolate mofetil have been observed (see section 4.8).

•  Myclausen should not be given to women of childbearing potential who are not using highly 
effective contraception (see section 4.6). 
•  Myclausen treatment should not be initiated in women of child bearing potential without 
providing a pregnancy test result to rule out unintended use in pregnancy (see section 4.6). 
•  Myclausen should not be used in pregnancy unless there is no suitable alternative treatment to 
prevent transplant rejection (see section 4.6). 
•  Myclausen should not be given to women who are breastfeeding (see section 4.6).  
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Neoplasms 
Patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products, 
including Myclausen, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other malignancies, 
particularly of the skin (see section 4.8). The risk appears to be related to the intensity and duration of 
immunosuppression rather than to the use of any specific agent. As general advice to minimise the risk 
for skin cancer, exposure to sunlight and UV light should be limited by wearing protective clothing 
and using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 
Infections 
Patients treated with immunosuppressants, including Myclausen, are at increased risk for opportunistic 
infections (bacterial, fungal, viral and protozoal), fatal infections and sepsis (see section 4.8). Such 
infections include latent viral reactivation, such as hepatitis B or hepatitis C reactivation and infections 
caused by polyomaviruses (BK virus associated nephropathy, JC virus associated progressive 
multifocal leukoencephalopathy PML). Cases of hepatitis due to reactivation of hepatitis B or hepatitis 
C have been reported in carrier patients treated with immunosuppressants. These infections are often 
related to a high total immunosuppressive burden and may lead to serious or fatal conditions that 
physicians should consider in the differential diagnosis in immunosuppressed patients with 
deteriorating renal function or neurological symptoms. Mycophenolic acid has a cytostatic effect on B- 
and T-lymphocytes, therefore an increased severity of COVID-19 may occur, and appropriate clinical 
action should be considered. 
There have been reports of hypogammaglobulinaemia in association with recurrent infections in 
patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressants. In some of 
these cases, switching mycophenolate mofetil to an alternative immunosuppressant resulted in serum 
IgG levels returning to normal. Patients on Myclausen who develop recurrent infections should have 
their serum immunoglobulins measured. In cases of sustained, clinically relevant 
hypogammaglobulinaemia, appropriate clinical action should be considered taking into account the 
potent cytostatic effects that mycophenolic acid has on T- and B-lymphocytes. 
There have been published reports of bronchiectasis in adults and children who received 
mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressants. In some of these cases 
switching mycophenolate mofetil to another immunosuppressant resulted in improvement in 
respiratory symptoms. The risk of bronchiectasis may be linked to hypogammaglobulinaemia or to a 
direct effect on the lung. There have also been isolated reports of interstitial lung disease and 
pulmonary fibrosis, some of which were fatal (see section 4.8). It is recommended that patients who 
develop persistent pulmonary symptoms, such as cough and dyspnoea, are investigated. 
Blood and immune system 
Patients receiving Myclausen should be monitored for neutropenia, which may be related to 
Myclausen itself, concomitant medications, viral infections, or some combination of these causes. 
Patients taking Myclausen should have complete blood counts weekly during the first month, twice 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
monthly for the second and third months of treatment, then monthly through the first year. If 
neutropenia develops (absolute neutrophil count < 1.3 x 103/µl), it may be appropriate to interrupt or 
discontinue Myclausen. 
Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients treated with mycophenolate 
mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressants. The mechanism for mycophenolate mofetil 
induced PRCA is unknown. PRCA may resolve with dose reduction or cessation of Myclausen 
therapy. Changes to Myclausen therapy should only be undertaken under appropriate supervision in 
transplant recipients in order to minimise the risk of graft rejection (see section 4.8). 
Patients receiving Myclausen should be instructed to report immediately any evidence of infection, 
unexpected bruising, bleeding or any other manifestation of bone marrow failure. 
Patients should be advised that, during treatment with Myclausen, vaccinations may be less effective 
and the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided (see section 4.5). Influenza vaccination may 
be of value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination. 
Gastro-intestinal 
Mycophenolate mofetil has been associated with an increased incidence of digestive system adverse 
events, including infrequent cases of gastrointestinal tract ulceration, haemorrhage and perforation, 
Myclausen should be administered with caution in patients with active serious digestive system 
disease. 
Mycophenolate mofetil is an IMPDH (inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase) inhibitor. Therefore, it 
should be avoided in patients with rare hereditary deficiency of hypoxanthine-guanine 
phosphoribosyl-transferase (HGPRT) such as Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller syndrome. 
Interactions 
Caution should be exercised when switching combination therapy from regimens containing 
immunosuppressants, which interfere with MPA enterohepatic recirculation, e.g. ciclosporin, to others 
devoid of this effect, e.g. tacrolimus, sirolimus, belatacept, or vice versa, as this might result in 
changes of MPA exposure. Drugs which interfere with MPA’s enterohepatic cycle (e.g. 
cholestyramine, antibiotics) should be used with caution due to their potential to reduce the plasma 
levels and efficacy of Myclausen (see also section 4.5). Therapeutic drug monitoring of MPA may be 
appropriate when switching combination therapy (e.g. from ciclosporin to tacrolimus or vice versa) or 
to ensure adequate immunosuppression in patients with high immunological risk (e.g. risk of rejection, 
treatment with antibiotics, addition or removal of an interacting medication). 
It is recommended that Myclausen should not be administered concomitantly with azathioprine 
because such concomitant administration has not been studied.  
The risk/benefit-ratio of mycophenolate mofetil in combination with sirolimus has not been 
established (see also section 4.5). 
Special populations 
Elderly patients may be at an increased risk of adverse events such as certain infections (including 
cytomegalovirus tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal haemorrhage and pulmonary 
oedema, compared with younger individuals (see section 4.8). 
Teratogenic effects 
Mycophenolate is a powerful human teratogen. Spontaneous abortion (rate of 45% to 49%) and 
congenital malformations (estimated rate of 23% to 27%) have been reported following MMF 
exposure during pregnancy. Therefore Myclausen is contraindicated in pregnancy unless there are no 
suitable alternative treatments to prevent transplant rejection. Female patients of childbearing potential 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
should be made aware of the risks and follow the recommendations provided in section 4.6 (e.g. 
contraceptive methods, pregnancy testing) prior to, during, and after therapy with Myclausen. 
Physicians should ensure that women taking mycophenolate understand the risk of harm to the baby, 
the need for effective contraception, and the need to immediately consult their physician if there is a 
possibility of pregnancy. 
Contraception (see section 4.6) 
Because of robust clinical evidence showing a high risk of abortion and congenital malformations 
when mycophenolate mofetil is used in pregnancy, every effort to avoid pregnancy during treatment 
should be taken. Therefore, women with childbearing potential must use at least one form of reliable 
contraception (see section 4.3) before starting Myclausen therapy, during therapy, and for six weeks 
after stopping the therapy; unless abstinence is the chosen method of contraception. Two 
complementary forms of contraception simultaneously are preferred to minimise the potential for 
contraceptive failure and unintended pregnancy. 
For contraception advice for men see section 4.6. 
Educational materials 
In order to assist patients in avoiding foetal exposure to mycophenolate and to provide additional 
important safety information, the Marketing Authorisation holder will provide educational materials to 
healthcare professionals. The educational materials will reinforce the warnings about the teratogenicity 
of mycophenolate, provide advice on contraception before therapy is started and guidance on the need 
for pregnancy testing. Full patient information about the teratogenic risk and the pregnancy prevention 
measures should be given by the physician to women of childbearing potential and, as appropriate, to 
male patients.  
Additional precautions 
Patients should not donate blood during therapy or for at least 6 weeks following discontinuation of 
mycophenolate. Men should not donate semen during therapy or for 90 days following discontinuation 
of mycophenolate. 
Sodium contents 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per capsule, that is to say 
essentially ‘sodium- free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Aciclovir 
Higher aciclovir plasma concentrations were observed when mycophenolate mofetil was administered 
with aciclovir in comparison to the administration of aciclovir alone. The changes in MPAG (the 
phenolic glucuronide of MPA) pharmacokinetics (MPAG increased by 8 %) were minimal and are not 
considered clinically significant. Because MPAG plasma concentrations are increased in the presence 
of renal impairment, as are aciclovir concentrations, the potential exists for mycophenolate mofetil and 
aciclovir, or its prodrugs, e.g. valaciclovir, to compete for tubular secretion and further increases in 
concentrations of both substances may occur. 
Antacids and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) 
Decreased MPA exposure has been observed when antacids, such as magnesium and aluminium 
hydroxides, and PPIs, including lansoprazole and pantoprazole, were administered with 
mycophenolate mofetil. When comparing rates of transplant rejection or rates of graft loss between 
mycophenolate mofetil patients taking PPIs versus mycophenolate mofetil patients not taking PPIs, no 
significant differences were seen. These data support extrapolation of this finding to all antacids 
because the reduction in exposure when mycophenolate mofetil was co- administered with magnesium 
and aluminium hydroxides is considerably less than when mycophenolate mofetil was co-administered 
with PPIs. 
Medicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation (e.g. cholestyramine, ciclosporin A, 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
antibiotics) 
Caution should be used with medicinal products that interfere with enterohepatic recirculation because 
of their potential to reduce the efficacy of Myclausen. 
Cholestyramine 
Following single dose administration of 1.5 g of mycophenolate mofetil to normal healthy subjects 
pre-treated with 4 g TID of cholestyramine for 4 days, there was a 40 % reduction in the AUC of MPA 
(see section 4.4 and section 5.2). Caution should be used during concomitant administration because 
of the potential to reduce efficacy of Myclausen. 
Ciclosporin A 
Ciclosporin A (CsA) pharmacokinetics are unaffected by mycophenolate mofetil. In contrast, if 
concomitant CsA treatment is stopped, an increase in MPA AUC of around 30 % should be expected. 
CsA interferes with MPA enterohepatic recycling, resulting in reduced MPA exposures by 30-50 % in 
renal transplant patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil and CsA compared with patients 
receiving sirolimus or belatacept and similar doses of mycophenolate mofetil (see also section 4.4). 
Conversely, changes of MPA exposure should be expected when switching patients from CsA to one 
of the immunosuppressants which does not interfere with MPA´s enterohepatic cycle. 
Antibiotics eliminating β-glucuronidase-producing bacteria in the intestine (e.g. aminoglycoside, 
cephalosporin, fluoroquinolone, and penicillin classes of antibiotics) may interfere with MPAG/MPA 
enterohepatic recirculation, thus leading to reduced systemic MPA exposure. Information concerning 
the following antibiotics is available: 
Ciprofloxacin or amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 
Reductions in pre-dose (trough) MPA concentrations of about 50% have been reported in renal 
transplant recipients in the days immediately following commencement of oral ciprofloxacin or 
amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid. This effect tended to diminish with continued antibiotic use and to 
cease within a few days of antibiotic discontinuation. The change in pre-dose level may not accurately 
represent changes in overall MPA exposure. Therefore, a change in the dose of Myclausen should not 
normally be necessary in the absence of clinical evidence of graft dysfunction. However, close clinical 
monitoring should be performed during the combination and shortly after antibiotic treatment. 
Norfloxacin and metronidazole 
In healthy volunteers, no significant interaction was observed when mycophenolate mofetil was 
concomitantly administered with norfloxacin or metronidazole separately. However, norfloxacin and 
metronidazole combined reduced the MPA exposure by approximately 30% following a single dose of 
mycophenolate mofetil. 
Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole 
No effect on the bioavailability of MPA was observed. 
Medicinal products that affect glucuronidation (e.g. isavuconazole, telmisartan) 
Concomitant administration of drugs affecting glucuronidation of MPA may change MPA exposure. 
Caution is therefore recommended when administering these drugs concomitantly with Myclausen. 
Isavuconazole 
An increase of MPA exposure (AUC0-∞) by 35% was observed with concomitant administration of 
isavuconazole. 
Telmisartan 
Concomitant administration of telmisartan and mycophenolate mofetil resulted in an approximately 
30 % decrease of MPA concentrations. Telmisartan changes MPA’s elimination by enhancing 
PPAR gamma (peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma) expression, which in turn results in 
an enhanced uridine diphosphate glucuronyltransferase isoform 1A9 (UGT1A9) expression and 
activity. When comparing rates of transplant rejection, rates of graft loss or adverse event profiles 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
between mycophenolate mofetil patients with and without concomitant telmisartan medication, no 
clinical consequences of the pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction were seen. 
Ganciclovir 
Based on the results of a single dose administration study of recommended doses of oral 
mycophenolate and IV ganciclovir and the known effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics 
of mycophenolate mofetil (see section 4.2) and ganciclovir, it is anticipated that co-administration of 
these agents (which compete for mechanisms of renal tubular secretion) will result in increases in 
MPAG and ganciclovir concentration. No substantial alteration of MPA pharmacokinetics is 
anticipated and Myclausen dose adjustment is not required. In patients with renal impairment in whom 
Myclausen and ganciclovir or its prodrugs, e.g. valganciclovir, are co-administered, the dose 
recommendations for ganciclovir should be observed and patients should be monitored carefully. 
Oral contraceptives 
The pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives were not affected to a clinically 
relevant degree by coadministration of mycophenolate mofetil (see also section 5.2). 
Rifampicin 
In patients not also taking ciclosporin, concomitant administration of mycophenolate mofetil and 
rifampicin resulted in a decrease in MPA exposure (AUC0-12 h) of 18 % to 70 %. It is recommended 
to monitor MPA exposure levels and to adjust Myclausen doses accordingly to maintain clinical 
efficacy when rifampicin is administered concomitantly. 
Sevelamer 
Decrease in MPA Cmax and AUC0-12h by 30 % and 25 %, respectively, were observed when 
mycophenolate mofetil was concomitantly administered with sevelamer without any clinical 
consequences (i.e. graft rejection). It is recommended, however, to administer Myclausen at least one 
hour before or three hours after sevelamer intake to minimise the impact on the absorption of MPA. 
There are no data on mycophenolate mofetil with phosphate binders other than sevelamer. 
Tacrolimus 
In hepatic transplant patients initiated on mycophenolate mofetil and tacrolimus, the AUC and Cmax 
of MPA, the active metabolite of mycophenolate mofetil, were not significantly affected by co-
administration with tacrolimus. In contrast, there was an increase of approximately 20 % in tacrolimus 
AUC when multiple doses of mycophenolate mofetil (1.5 g BID) were administered to hepatic 
transplant patients taking tacrolimus. However, in renal transplant patients, tacrolimus concentration 
did not appear to be altered by mycophenolate mofetil (see also section 4.4). 
Live vaccines 
Live vaccines should not be given to patients with an impaired immune response. The antibody 
response to other vaccines may be diminished (see also section 4.4). 
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
Potential interactions 
Co-administration of probenecid with mycophenolate mofetil in monkeys raises plasma AUC of 
MPAG by 3-fold. Thus, other substances known to undergo renal tubular secretion may compete with 
MPAG, and thereby raise plasma concentrations of MPAG or the other substance undergoing tubular 
secretion. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Pregnancy whilst taking mycophenolate must be avoided. Therefore women of childbearing potential 
must use at least one form of reliable contraception (see section 4.3) before starting Myclausen 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
therapy, during therapy, and for six weeks after stopping the therapy, unless abstinence is the chosen 
method of contraception. Two complementary forms of contraception simultaneously are preferred. 
Pregnancy 
Myclausen is contraindicated during pregnancy unless there is no suitable alternative treatment to 
prevent transplant rejection. Treatment should not be initiated without providing a negative pregnancy 
test result to rule out unintended use in pregnancy. 
Female patients of reproductive potential must be made aware of the increased risk of pregnancy loss 
and congenital malformations at the beginning of the treatment and must be counselled regarding 
pregnancy prevention and planning. 
Before starting Myclausen treatment, women of child bearing potential should have two negative 
serum or urine  pregnancy tests with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL in order to exclude unintended 
exposure of an embryo to mycophenolate. It is recommended that the second test should be performed 
8 – 10 days after the first test. For transplants from deceased donors, if it is not possible to perform 
two tests 8 – 10 days apart before treatment starts (because of the timing of transplant organ 
availability), a pregnancy test must be performed immediately before starting treatment and a further 
test 8 – 10 days later. Pregnancy tests should be repeated as clinically required (e.g. after any gap in 
contraception is reported). Results of all pregnancy tests should be discussed with the patient. Patients 
should be instructed to consult their physician immediately should pregnancy occur. 
Mycophenolate is a powerful human teratogen, with an increased risk of spontaneous abortions and 
congenital malformations in case of exposure during pregnancy; 
• 
Spontaneous abortions have been reported in 45 to 49% of pregnant women exposed to 
mycophenolate mofetil, compared to a reported rate of between 12 and 33% in solid organ 
transplant patients treated with immunosuppressants other than mycophenolate mofetil. 
•  Based on literature reports, malformations occurred in 23 to 27% of live births in women exposed 
to mycophenolate mofetil during pregnancy (compared to 2 to 3 % of live births in the overall 
population and approximately 4 to 5% of live births in solid organ transplant recipients treated 
with immunosuppressants other than mycophenolate mofetil). 
Congenital malformations, including reports of multiple malformations, have been observed post-
marketing in children of patients exposed to Myclausen in combination with other 
immunosuppressants during pregnancy. The following malformations were most frequently reported:  
•  Abnormalities of the ear (e.g. abnormally formed or absent external ear), external auditory canal 
atresia (middle ear); 
Facial malformations such as cleft lip, cleft palate, micrognathia and hypertelorism of the orbits; 
• 
•  Abnormalities of the eye (e.g. coloboma); 
•  Congenital heart disease such as atrial and ventricular septal defects; 
•  Malformations of the fingers (e.g. polydactyly, syndactyly); 
•  Tracheo-oesophageal malformations (e.g. oesophageal atresia);  
•  Nervous system malformations such as spina bifida;  
•  Renal abnormalities. 
In addition, there have been isolated reports of the following malformations: 
•  Microphthalmia; 
• 
• 
• 
congenital choroid plexus cyst; 
septum pellucidum agenesis; 
olfactory nerve agenesis. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  
Breast-feeding 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Mycophenolate mofetil has been shown to be excreted in the milk of lactating rats. It is not known 
whether this substance is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse 
reactions to mycophenolate mofetil in breast-fed infants, Myclausen is contraindicated in nursing 
mothers (see section 4.3). 
Men 
The limited clinical evidence available does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or 
miscarriage following paternal exposure to mycophenolate mofetil. 
MPA is a powerful teratogen. It is not known if MPA is present in semen. Calculations based on 
animal data show that the maximum amount of MPA that could potentially be transferred to woman is 
so low that it would be unlikely to have an effect. Mycophenolate has been shown to be genotoxic in 
animal studies at concentrations exceeding the human therapeutic exposures only by small margins, 
such that the risk of genotoxic effects on sperm cells cannot completely be excluded. 
Therefore, the following precautionary measures are recommended: sexually active male patients or 
their female partners are recommended to use reliable contraception during treatment of the male 
patient and for at least 90 days after cessation of mycophenolate mofetil. Male patients of reproductive 
potential should be made aware of and discuss with a qualified health-care professional the potential 
risks of fathering a child. 
Fertility 
Mycophenolate mofetil had no effect on fertility of male rats at oral doses up to 20 mg/kg/day. The 
systemic exposure at this dose represents 2 – 3 times the clinical exposure at the recommended clinical 
dose of 2 g/day in renal transplant patients and 1.3 – 2 times the clinical exposure at the recommended 
clinical dose of 3 g/day in cardiac transplant patients. In a female fertility and reproduction study 
conducted in rats, oral doses of 4.5 mg/kg/day caused malformations (including anophthalmia, 
agnathia, and hydrocephaly) in the first generation offspring in the absence of maternal toxicity. The 
systemic exposure at this dose was approximately 0.5 times the clinical exposure at the recommended 
clinical dose of 2 g/day for renal transplant patients and approximately 0.3 times the clinical exposure 
at the recommended clinical dose of 3 g/day for cardiac transplant patients. No effects on fertility or 
reproductive parameters were evident in the dams or in the subsequent generation. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Myclausen has moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Myclausen may cause somnolence, confusion, dizziness, tremor or hypotension, and therefore patients 
are advised to use caution when driving or using machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Diarrhoea (up to 52.6%), leukopenia (up to 45.8%), bacterial infections (up to 39.9%)and vomiting 
(up to 39.1%)were among the most common and/or serious adverse drug reactions associated with the 
administration of mycophenolate mofetil in combination with ciclosporin and corticosteroids. There is 
also evidence of a higher frequency of certain types of infections (see section 4.4). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The adverse reactions from clinical trials and post-marketing experience are listed in Table 1, by 
MedDRA system organ class (SOC) along with their frequencies. The corresponding frequency 
category for each adverse reaction is based on the following convention: very common (≥1/10), 
common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000) and very 
rare (<1/10,000). Due to the large differences observed in the frequency of certain adverse reactions 
across the different transplant indications, the frequency is presented separately for renal, hepatic and 
cardiac transplant patients.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Malignancies 
Patients receiving immunosuppressive regimens involving combinations of medicinal products, 
including mycophenolate mofetil, are at increased risk of developing lymphomas and other 
malignancies, particularly of the skin (see section 4.4). Three-year safety data in renal and cardiac 
transplant patients did not reveal any unexpected changes in incidence of malignancy compared to the 
1-year data. Hepatic transplant patients were followed for at least 1 year, but less than 3 years. 
Infections 
All patients treated with immunosuppressants are at increased risk of bacterial, viral and fungal 
infections (some of which may lead to a fatal outcome), including those caused by opportunistic 
agents and latent viral reactivation. The risk increases with total immunosuppressive load (see 
section 4.4). The most serious infections were sepsis, peritonitis, meningitis, endocarditis, tuberculosis 
and atypical mycobacterial infection. The most common opportunistic infections in patients receiving 
mycophenolate mofetil (2 g or 3 g daily) with other immunosuppressants in controlled clinical trials in 
renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant patients followed for at least 1 year were candida mucocutaneous, 
CMV viraemia/syndrome and Herpes simplex. The proportion of patients with CMV 
viraemia/syndrome was 13.5%. Cases of BK virus associated nephropathy, as well as cases of JC virus 
associated progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), have been reported in patients treated 
with immunosuppressants, including mycophenolate mofetil. 
Blood and lymphatic disorders 
Cytopenias, including leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia and pancytopenia, are known risks 
associated with mycophenolate mofetil and may lead or contribute to the occurrence of infections and 
hemorrhages (see section 4.4). Agranulocytosis and neutropenia have been reported; therefore, regular 
monitoring of patients taking mycophenolate mofetil is advised (see section 4.4). There have been 
31 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reports of aplastic anaemia and bone marrow failure in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil, 
some of which have been fatal. Cases of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) have been reported in patients 
treated with mycophenolate mofetil (see section 4.4). 
Isolated cases of abnormal neutrophil morphology, including the acquired Pelger-Huet anomaly, have 
been observed in patients treated with mycophenolate mofetil. These changes are not associated with 
impaired neutrophil function. These changes may suggest a ‘left shift’ in the maturity of neutrophils in 
haematological investigations, which may be mistakenly interpreted as a sign of infection in 
immunosuppressed patients such as those that receive mycophenolate mofetil. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
The most serious gastrointestinal disorders were ulceration and hemorrhage which are known risks 
associated with mycophenolate mofetil. Mouth, esophageal, gastric, duodenal, and intestinal ulcers 
often complicated by hemorrhage, as well as hematemesis, melena, and hemorrhagic forms of gastritis 
and colitis were commonly reported during the pivotal clinical trials. The most common 
gastrointestinal disorders, however, were diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. Endoscopic investigation of 
patients with mycophenolate mofetil-related diarrhea have revealed isolated cases of intestinal villous 
atrophy (see section 4.4). 
Hypersensitivity 
Hypersensitivity reactions, including angioneurotic oedema and anaphylactic reaction have been 
reported. 
Pregnancy, puerperium and perinatal conditions 
Cases of spontaneous abortion have been reported in patients exposed to mycophenolate mofetil, 
mainly in the first trimester, see section 4.6. 
Congenital disorders 
Congenital malformations have been observed post-marketing in children of patients exposed to 
mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressants, see section 4.6. 
Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
There have been isolated reports of interstitial lung disease and pulmonary fibrosis in patients treated 
with mycophenolate mofetil in combination with other immunosuppressants, some of which have been 
fatal. There have also been reports of bronchiectasis in children and adults. 
Immune system disorders 
Hypogammaglobulinaemia has been reported in patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil in 
combination with other immunosuppressants. 
General disorders and administration site conditions 
Oedema, including peripheral, face and scrotal edema, was reported very commonly during the pivotal 
trials. Musculoskeletal pain such as myalgia, and neck and back pain were also very commonly 
reported. 
De novo purine synthesis inhibitors-associated acute inflammatory syndrome has been described from 
post-marketing experience as a paradoxical proinflammatory reaction associated with mycophenolate 
mofetil and mycophenolic acid, characterised by fever, arthralgia, arthritis, muscle pain and elevated 
inflammatory markers. Literature case reports showed rapid improvement following discontinuation of 
the medicinal product. 
Special populations 
Paediatric population 
The type and frequency of adverse reactions in a clinical study, which recruited 92 paediatric patients 
aged 2 to 18 years who were given 600 mg/m2 mycophenolate mofetil orally twice daily, were 
generally similar to those observed in adult patients given 1 g mycophenolate mofetil twice daily. 
However, the following treatment-related adverse events were more frequent in the paediatric 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
population, particularly in children under 6 years of age, when compared to adults: diarrhoea, sepsis, 
leukopenia, anaemia and infection. 
Elderly 
Elderly patients (≥ 65 years) may generally be at increased risk of adverse reactions due to 
immunosuppression. Elderly patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil as part of a combination 
immunosuppressive regimen, may be at increased risk of certain infections (including cytomegalovirus 
tissue invasive disease) and possibly gastrointestinal haemorrhage and pulmonary oedema, compared 
to younger individuals. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Reports of overdoses with mycophenolate mofetil have been received from clinical trials and during 
post-marketing experience. In many of these cases, no adverse events were reported. In those overdose 
cases in which adverse events were reported, the events fall within the known safety profile of the 
medicinal product. 
It is expected that an overdose of mycophenolate mofetil could possibly result in oversuppression of 
the immune system and increase susceptibility to infections and bone marrow suppression (see 
section 4.4). If neutropenia develops, dosing with Myclausen should be interrupted or the dose 
reduced (see section 4.4). 
Haemodialysis would not be expected to remove clinically significant amounts of MPA or MPAG. 
Bile acid sequestrants, such as cholestyramine, can remove MPA by decreasing the enterohepatic re-
circulation of the drug (see section 5.2). 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group:immunosuppressive agents, ATC code L04AA06 
Mechanism of action 
Mycophenolate mofetil is the 2-morpholinoethyl ester of MPA. MPA is a selective, uncompetitive and 
reversible inhibitor of IMPDH, and therefore inhibits the de novo pathway of guanosine nucleotide 
synthesis without incorporation into DNA. Because T- and B-lymphocytes are critically dependent for 
their proliferation on de novo synthesis of purines whereas other cell types can utilise salvage 
pathways, MPA has more potent cytostatic effects on lymphocytes than on other cells.  
In addition to its inhibition of IMPDH and the resulting deprivation of lymphocytes, MPA also 
influences cellular checkpoints responsible for metabolic programming of lymphocytes. It has been 
shown, using human CD4+ T-cells, that MPA shifts transcriptional activities in lymphocytes from a 
proliferative state to catabolic processes relevant to metabolism and survival leading to an anergic 
state of T-cells, whereby the cells become unresponsive to their specific antigen. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following oral administration, mycophenolate mofetil undergoes rapid and extensive absorption and 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
complete presystemic metabolism to the active metabolite, MPA. As evidenced by suppression of 
acute rejection following renal transplantation, the immunosuppressant activity of mycophenolate 
mofetil is correlated with MPA concentration. The mean bioavailability of oral mycophenolate 
mofetil, based on MPA AUC, is 94 % relative to IV mycophenolate mofetil. Food had no effect on the 
extent of absorption (MPA AUC) of mycophenolate mofetil when administered at doses of 1.5 g BID 
to renal transplant patients. However, MPA Cmax was decreased by 40 % in the presence of food. 
Mycophenolate mofetil is not measurable systemically in plasma following oral administration. 
Distribution 
As a result of enterohepatic recirculation, secondary increases in plasma MPA concentration are 
usually observed at approximately 6-12 hours post-dose. A reduction in the AUC of MPA of 
approximately 40 % is associated with the co-administration of cholestyramine (4 g TID), indicating 
that there is a significant amount of enterohepatic recirculation. 
MPA at clinically relevant concentrations is 97 % bound to plasma albumin. 
In the early post-transplant period (< 40 days post-transplant), renal, cardiac and hepatic transplant 
patients had mean MPA AUCs approximately 30% lower and Cmax approximately 40% lower 
compared to the late post-transplant period (3 - 6 months post-transplant). 
Biotransformation 
MPA is metabolised principally by glucuronyl transferase (isoform UGT1A9) to form the inactive 
phenolic glucuronide of MPA (MPAG). In vivo, MPAG is converted back to free MPA via 
enterohepatic recirculation. A minor acylglucuronide (AcMPAG) is also formed. AcMPAG is 
pharmacologically active and is suspected to be responsible for some of mycophenolate mofetil´s side 
effects (diarrhoea, leukopenia). 
Elimination 
A negligible amount of substance is excreted as MPA (< 1 % of the dose) in the urine. Oral 
administration of radiolabelled mycophenolate mofetil results in complete recovery of the 
administered dose with 93 % of the administered dose recovered in the urine and 6 % recovered in the 
faeces. Most (about 87 %) of the administered dose is excreted in the urine as MPAG. 
At clinically encountered concentrations, MPA and MPAG are not removed by haemodialysis. 
However, at high MPAG plasma concentrations (> 100 µg/mL), small amounts of MPAG are 
removed. 
By interfering with enterohepatic recirculation of the drug, bile acid sequestrants such as 
cholestyramine, reduce MPA AUC (see section 4.9). 
MPA’s disposition depends on several transporters. Organic anion-transporting polypeptides (OATPs) 
and multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) are involved in MPA’s disposition; OATP 
isoforms, MRP2 and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) are transporters associated with the 
glucuronides’ biliary excretion. Multidrug resistance protein 1 (MDR1) is also able to transport MPA, 
but its contribution seems to be confined to the absorption process. In the kidney, MPA and its 
metabolites potently interact with renal organic anion transporters. 
Enterohepatic recirculation interferes with accurate determination of MPA’s disposition parameters; 
only apparent values can be indicated. In healthy volunteers and patients with autoimmune disease 
approximate clearance values of 10.6 L/h and 8.27 L/h respectively and half-life values of 17 h were 
observed. In transplant patients mean clearance values were higher (range 11.9-34.9 L/h) and mean 
half-life values shorter (5-11 h) with little difference between renal, hepatic or cardiac transplant 
patients. In the individual patients, these elimination parameters vary based on type of co-treatment 
with other immunosuppressants, time post-transplantation, plasma albumin concentration and renal 
function. These factors explain why reduced exposure is seen when mycophenolat mofetil is co-
administered with cyclosporine (see section 4.5) and why plasma concentrations tend to increase over 
time compared to what is observed immediately after transplantation. 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
In a single dose study (6 subjects/group), mean plasma MPA AUC observed in subjects with severe 
chronic renal impairment (glomerular filtration rate < 25 mL•min-1•1.73 m-2) were 28-75 % higher 
relative to the means observed in normal healthy subjects or subjects with lesser degrees of renal 
impairment. The mean single dose MPAG AUC was 3-6-fold higher in subjects with severe renal 
impairment than in subjects with mild renal impairment or normal healthy subjects, consistent with the 
known renal elimination of MPAG. Multiple dosing of mycophenolate mofetil in patients with severe 
chronic renal impairment has not been studied. No data are available for cardiac or hepatic transplant 
patients with severe chronic renal impairment. 
Delayed renal graft function 
In patients with delayed renal graft function post-transplant, mean MPA AUC0–12 h was comparable to 
that seen in post-transplant patients without delayed graft function. Mean plasma MPAG AUC0-12 h 
was 2-3-fold higher than in post-transplant patients without delayed graft function. There may be a 
transient increase in the free fraction and concentration of plasma MPA in patients with delayed renal 
graft function. Dose adjustment of Myclausen does not appear to be necessary. 
Hepatic impairment 
In volunteers with alcoholic cirrhosis, hepatic MPA glucuronidation processes were relatively 
unaffected by hepatic parenchymal disease. Effects of hepatic disease on these processes probably 
depend on the particular disease. Hepatic disease with predominantly biliary damage, such as primary 
biliary cirrhosis, may show a different effect. 
Paediatric population 
Pharmacokinetic parameters were evaluated in 49 paediatric renal transplant patients (aged 2 to 
18 years) given 600 mg/m2 mycophenolate mofetil orally twice daily. This dose achieved MPA AUC 
values similar to those seen in adult renal transplant patients receiving mycophenolate mofetil at a 
dose of 1 g BID in the early and late post-transplant period. MPA AUC values across age groups were 
similar in the early and late post-transplant period. 
Elderly 
The pharmacokinetics of mycophenolate mofetil and its metabolites have not been found to be altered 
in the elderly patients (≥ 65 years) when compared to younger transplant patients. 
Patients taking oral contraceptives 
A study of the co-administration of mycophenolate mofetil (1 g BID) and combined oral 
contraceptives containing ethinylestradiol (0.02 mg to 0.04 mg) and levonorgestrel (0.05 mg to 
0.20 mg), desogestrel (0.15 mg) or gestodene (0.05 mg to 0.10 mg) conducted in 18 non-transplant 
women (not taking other immunosuppressants) over 3 consecutive menstrual cycles showed no 
clinically relevant influence of mycophenolate mofetil on the ovulation suppressing action of the oral 
contraceptives. Serum levels of LH, FSH and progesterone were not significantly affected. The 
pharmacokinetics of oral contraceptives were not affected to a clinically relevant degree by co-
administration of mycophenolate mofetil (see also section 4.5). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
In experimental models, mycophenolate mofetil was not tumourigenic. The highest dose tested in the 
animal carcinogenicity studies resulted in approximately 2-3 times the systemic exposure (AUC or 
Cmax) observed in renal transplant patients at the recommended clinical dose of 2 g/day and 
1.3-2 times the systemic exposure (AUC or Cmax) observed in cardiac transplant patients at the 
recommended clinical dose of 3 g/day. 
Two genotoxicity assays (in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and in vivo mouse bone marrow 
micronucleus test) showed a potential of mycophenolate mofetil to cause chromosomal aberrations. 
These effects can be related to the pharmacodynamic mode of action, i.e. inhibition of nucleotide 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
synthesis in sensitive cells. Other in vitro tests for detection of gene mutation did not demonstrate 
genotoxic activity. 
In teratology studies in rats and rabbits, foetal resorptions and malformations occurred in rats at 
6 mg/kg/day (including anophthalmia, agnathia, and hydrocephaly) and in rabbits at 90 mg/kg/day 
(including cardiovascular and renal anomalies, such as ectopia cordis and ectopic kidneys, and 
diaphragmatic and umbilical hernia), in the absence of maternal toxicity. The systemic exposure at 
these levels is approximately equivalent to or less than 0.5 times the clinical exposure at the 
recommended clinical dose of 2 g/day for renal transplant patients and approximately 0.3 times the 
clinical exposure at the recommended clinical dose of 3 g/day for cardiac transplant patients (see 
section 4.6). 
The haematopoietic and lymphoid systems were the primary organs affected in toxicology studies 
conducted with mycophenolate mofetil in the rat, mouse, dog and monkey. These effects occurred at 
systemic exposure levels that are equivalent to or less than the clinical exposure at the recommended 
dose of 2 g/day for renal transplant recipients. Gastrointestinal effects were observed in the dog at 
systemic exposure levels equivalent to or less than the clinical exposure at the recommended dose. 
Gastrointestinal and renal effects consistent with dehydration were also observed in the monkey at the 
highest dose (systemic exposure levels equivalent to or greater than clinical exposure). The nonclinical 
toxicity profile of mycophenolate mofetil appears to be consistent with adverse events observed in 
human clinical trials which now provide safety data of more relevance to the patient population (see 
section 4.8).

EFFECTIVE USE OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
Not applicable. 
•  Additional risk minimisation measures  
Prior to the use of Myclausen in each Member State (MS) the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) 
must agree about the content and format of the educational programme and a follow-up pregnancy 
questionnaire, including communication media, distribution modalities, and any other aspects of the 
programme, with the National Competent Authority. 
The educational programme is aimed at ensuring that the health professionals and patients are aware 
of the teratogenicity and mutagenicity, the need for pregnancy tests before starting therapy with 
mycophenolate mofetil, the contraceptive requirements for both male and female patients and what to 
do in case of pregnancy during treatment with Myclausen.  
The MAH shall ensure that in each MS where Myclausen is marketed, all healthcare professionals and 
patients who are expected to prescribe, dispense or use Myclausen are provided with the following 
educational package:  
·         Physician educational material  
·         Patient information pack  
The health professional educational material should contain:  
·         The Summary of Product Characteristics  
·         Guide for healthcare professionals  
The patient information pack should contain:  
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
·         The Package Leaflet  
·         Guide for patients  
The educational materials should be implemented within four months after completion of this 
procedure and shall contain the following key elements: 
Separate guides for healthcare professionals and patients should be provided. For patients, the text 
should be appropriately separated for men and women. The following areas should be covered in these 
guides:  
•  An introduction in each guide will inform the reader that the purpose of the guide is to tell them 
that a foetal exposure must be avoided and how to minimize the risk of birth defects and 
miscarriage associated with mycophenolate mofetil. It will explain that although this guide is very 
important it does not provide full information on mycophenolate mofetil and that the SmPC 
(healthcare professionals) and package leaflet (patients) supplied with the medicine must also be 
read carefully.  
•  Background information on mycophenolate mofetil teratogenicity and mutagenicity in humans. 
This section will provide important background information concerning the teratogenicity and 
mutagenicity of mycophenolate mofetil. It will provide details about the nature and magnitude of 
the risk, in line with the information provided in the SmPC. The information provided in this 
section will facilitate a correct understanding of the risk and explain the rationale for the 
following pregnancy prevention measures. Guides should also mention that patients should not to 
give this drug to any other person.  
•  Counselling of patients: This section will emphasise the importance of a thorough, informative 
and ongoing dialogue between patient and healthcare professional about the pregnancy risks 
associated with mycophenolate mofetil and the relevant minimisation strategies including 
alternative treatment choices, if applicable. The need to plan a pregnancy will be highlighted.  
•  The need to avoid foetal exposure: Contraceptive requirements for patients of reproductive 
potential prior to, during and after treatment with mycophenolate mofetil. Contraceptive 
requirements for sexually active male patients (including vasectomised men) and female patients 
of childbearing potential will be explained. The need for contraception prior to, during and after 
treatment with mycophenolate mofetil, including details of the duration of time for which 
contraception must be continued after cessation of therapy, will be clearly stated.  
In addition, the text relating to women should explain the pregnancy test requirements prior to and 
during therapy with mycophenolate mofetil; including the advice for two negative pregnancy tests 
prior to starting therapy and the importance of the timing of these tests. The need for subsequent 
pregnancy tests during treatment will also be explained.  
•  Advice that patients should not donate blood during therapy or for at least 6 weeks following 
discontinuation of mycophenolate. Furthermore, men should not donate semen during therapy or 
for 90 days following discontinuation of mycophenolate. 
•  Advice on action if a pregnancy occurs or is suspected during or shortly after being treated with 
mycophenolate mofetil. Patients will be informed that they should not stop taking mycophenolate 
mofetil but must contact their doctor immediately. It will be explained that the correct course of 
action, based on an assessment of the individual benefit-risk, will be determined on a case by case 
basis through a discussion between the treating physician and the patient. 
In addition, a pregnancy follow-up questionnaire including details of exposure during pregnancy, 
including timing and dose; duration of therapy, before and during pregnancy; concomitant drugs; 
known teratogenic risks and full details of congenital malformations should be agreed to with the 
national competent authorities and implemented within four months after completion of this 
procedure.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Myclausen is and what it is used for 
This belongs to a group of medicines called “immunosuppressants”. 
Myclausen contains mycophenolate mofetil. 
• 
Myclausen is used to prevent your body rejecting a transplanted organ. 
• 
Myclausen should be used together with other medicines: 
• 
Ciclosporin and corticosteroids. 
A kidney, heart or liver. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Myclausen 
WARNING 
Mycophenolate causes birth defects and miscarriage. If you are a woman who could become pregnant, 
you must provide a negative pregnancy test before starting treatment and must follow the 
contraception advice given to you by your doctor. 
Your doctor will speak to you and give you written information, particularly on the effects of 
mycophenolate on unborn babies. Read the information carefully and follow the instructions. 
If you do not fully understand these instructions, please ask your doctor to explain them again before 
you take mycophenolate. See also further information in this section under “Warnings and 
precautions” and “Pregnancy and breast-feeding”. 
Do not take Myclausen 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If you are allergic to mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid or any of the other ingredients 
of this medicine (listed in section 6). 
If you are a woman who could be pregnant and you have not provided a negative pregnancy test 
before your first prescription, as mycophenolate causes birth defects and miscarriage. 
If you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant or think you may be pregnant 
If you are not using effective contraception (see Pregnancy, contraception and breast-feeding). 
If you are breast-feeding. 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Do not take this medicine if any of the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist before taking Myclausen. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor straight away before starting treatment with Myclausen 
• 
If you are older than 65 years as you may have an increased risk of developing adverse events 
such as certain viral infections, gastrointestinal bleeding and pulmonary oedema when 
compared to younger patients 
If you have a sign of infection such as a fever or sore throat 
If you have any unexpected bruising or bleeding 
If you have ever had a problem with your digestive system such as a stomach ulcer 
If you are planning to become pregnant or if you get pregnant while you or your partner are 
taking Myclausen. 
If you have a hereditary enzyme deficiency such as Lesch-Nyhan and Kelley-Seegmiller 
syndrome 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor straight away before starting 
treatment with Myclausen. 
The effect of sunlight 
Myclausen reduces your body’s defences. As a result, there is an increased risk of skin cancer. Limit 
the amount of sunlight and UV light you get. Do this by: 
• 
• 
wearing protective clothing that also covers your head, neck, arms and legs 
using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 
Children 
Do not give this medicine to children younger than 2 years because based on the limited safety and 
efficacy data for this age group no dose recommendations can be made. 
Other medicines and Myclausen 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription, including herbal medicines. This 
is because Myclausen can affect the way some other medicines work. Also other medicines can affect 
the way Myclausen works. 
In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines before 
you start Myclausen: 
• 
azathioprine or other medicines that suppress your immune system (given after a transplant 
operation) 
cholestyramine (used to treat high cholesterol) 
rifampicin (an antibiotic used to prevent and treat infections such as tuberculosis (TB)) 
antacids or proton pump inhibitors (used for acid problems in your stomach such as indigestion) 
phosphate binders (used by people with chronic kidney failure to reduce how much phosphate 
gets absorbed into their blood). 
antibiotics (used to treat bacterial infections) 
isavuconazole (used to treat fungal infections) 
telmisartan (used to treat high blood pressure) 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Vaccines 
If you need to have a vaccination (a live vaccine) while taking Myclausen, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist first. Your doctor will have to advise you on what vaccines you can have. 
You must not donate blood during treatment with Myclausen and for at least 6 weeks after stopping 
treatment. Men must not donate semen during treatment with Myclausen and for at least 90 days after 
stopping treatment. 
Myclausen with food and drink 
53 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Taking food and drink has no effect on your treatment with Myclausen. 
Before you start taking Myclausen 
During your entire treatment with Myclausen 
For 6 weeks after you stop taking Myclausen. 
Contraception in women taking Myclausen 
If you are a woman who could become pregnant you must use an effective method of contraception 
with Myclausen. This includes: 
• 
• 
• 
Talk to your doctor about the most suitable contraception for you. This will depend on your individual 
situation. Two forms of contraception are preferable as this will reduce the risk of unintended 
pregnancy. Contact your doctor as soon as possible, if you think your contraception may not 
have been effective or if you have forgotten to take your contraceptive pill. 
You cannot become pregnant if any of the following conditions applies to you: 
• 
You are post-menopausal, i.e. at least 50 years old and your last period was more than a year 
ago (if your periods have stopped because you have had treatment for cancer, then there is still a 
chance you could become pregnant) 
Your fallopian tubes and both ovaries have been removed by surgery (bilateral salpingo-
oophorectomy) 
Your womb (uterus) has been removed by surgery (hysterectomy) 
Your ovaries no longer work (premature ovarian failure, which has been confirmed by a 
specialist gynaecologist) 
You were born with one of the following rare conditions that make pregnancy impossible: the 
XY genotype, Turner’s syndrome or uterine agenesis 
You are a child or teenager who has not started having periods. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Contraception in men taking Myclausen 
The available evidence does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage if the 
father takes mycophenolate. However, a risk cannot be completely excluded. As a precautionyou or 
your female partner are recommended to use reliable contraception during treatment and for 90 days 
after you stop taking Myclausen.  
If you are planning to have a child, talk to your doctor about the potential risks and alternative 
therapies. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will talk to you about 
the risks in case of pregnancy and the alternatives you can take to prevent rejection of your transplant 
organ if: 
• 
• 
You plan to become pregnant. 
You miss or think you have missed a period, or you have unusual menstrual bleeding, or suspect 
you are pregnant. 
You have sex without using effective methods of contraception. 
• 
If you do become pregnant during the treatment with mycophenolate, you must inform your doctor 
immediately. However, keep taking Myclausen until you see him or her. 
Pregnancy 
Mycophenolate causes a very high frequency of miscarriage (50%) and of severe birth defects (23 - 
27%) in the unborn baby. Birth defects which have been reported include anomalies of ears, of eyes, 
of face (cleft lip/palate), of development of fingers, of heart, oesophagus (tube that connects the throat 
with the stomach), kidneys and nervous system (for example spina bifida (where the bones of the 
spine are not properly developed).Your baby may be affected by one or more of these. 
If you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must provide a negative pregnancy test before 
starting treatment and must follow the contraception advice given to you by your doctor. Your doctor 
may request more than one test to ensure you are not pregnant before starting treatment. 
54 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
Do not take Myclausen if you are breast-feeding. This is because small amounts of the medicine can 
pass into the mother’s milk. 
Driving and using machines 
Myclausen has a moderate influence on your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If you feel 
drowsy, numb or confused, talk to your doctor or nurse and do not drive or use any tools or machines 
until you feel better. 
Myclausen contains sodium 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’

4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Talk to a doctor straight away if you notice any of the following serious side effects – you 
may need urgent medical treatment: 
• 
• 
• 
you have a sign of infection such as a fever or sore throat 
you have any unexpected bruising or bleeding 
you have a rash, swelling of your face, lips, tongue or throat, with difficulty breathing - you may 
be having a serious allergic reaction to the medicine (such as anaphylaxis, angioeodema). 
Usual problems 
Some of the more usual problems are diarrhoea, fewer white cells or red cells in your blood, infection 
and vomiting. Your doctor will do regular blood tests to check for any changes in 
• 
the number of your blood cells or signs of infections. 
Children may be more likely than adults to have some side effects. These include diarrhoea, infections, 
fewer white cells and fewer red cells in the blood. 
Fighting infections 
Myclausen reduces your body’s defences. This is to stop you rejecting your transplant. As a result, 
your body will not be as good as normal at fighting infections. This means you may catch more 
infections than usual. This includes infections of the brain, skin, mouth, stomach and gut, lungs and 
urinary system. 
Lymph and skin cancer 
As can happen in patients taking this type of medicine (immune-suppressants), a very small number of 
patients on Myclausen have developed cancer of the lymphoid tissues and skin. 
General unwanted effects 
You may get general side effects affecting your body as a whole. These include serious allergic 
reactions (such as anaphylaxis, angioeodema), fever, feeling very tired, difficulty sleeping, pains (such 
as stomach, chest, joint or muscle), headache, flu symptoms and swelling. 
Other unwanted effects may include: 
Skin problems such as: 
• 
acne, cold sores, shingles, skin growth, hair loss, rash, itching. 
Urinary problems such as: 
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
blood in the urine. 
Digestive system and mouth problems such as: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
swelling of the gums and mouth ulcers 
inflammation of the pancreas, colon or stomach 
gastrointestinal disorders including bleeding 
liver disorders 
diarrhoea, constipation, feeling sick (nausea), indigestion, loss of appetite, flatulence. 
Nervous system problems such as:

• 
tremor, muscle spasms, convulsions 
• 
feeling anxious or depressed, changes in your mood or thoughts. 
• 
Heart and blood vessel problems such as: 
• 
change in blood pressure, accelerated heartbeat, widening of blood vessels. 
Lung problems such as: 
• 
• 
pneumonia, bronchitis 
shortness of breath, cough, which can be due to bronchiectasis (a condition in which the lung 
airways are abnormally dilated) or pulmonary fibrosis (scarring of the lung). Talk to your doctor 
if you develop a persistent cough or breathlessness 
fluid on the lungs or inside the chest 
sinus problems. 
• 
• 
Other problems such as:

you must provide a negative pregnancy test before starting treatment and must follow the 
contraception advice given to you by your doctor. 
Your doctor will speak to you and give you written information, particularly on the effects of 
mycophenolate on unborn babies. Read the information carefully and follow the instructions. 
If you do not fully understand these instructions, please ask your doctor to explain them again before 
you take mycophenolate. See also further information in this section under “Warnings and 
precautions” and “Pregnancy and breast-feeding”.

pharmacist before taking Myclausen. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor straight away before starting treatment with Myclausen:

such as certain viral infections, gastrointestinal bleeding and pulmonary oedema when 
compared to younger patients 
If you have a sign of infection such as a fever or sore throat

syndrome 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
If any of the above apply to you (or you are not sure), talk to your doctor straight away before starting 
treatment with Myclausen. 
The effect of sunlight 
Myclausen reduces your body’s defences. As a result, there is an increased risk of skin cancer. Limit 
the amount of sunlight and UV light you get. Do this by: 
• 
• 
wearing protective clothing that also covers your head, neck, arms and legs 
using a sunscreen with a high protection factor. 
Children 
Do not give this medicine to children younger than 2 years because based on the limited safety and 
efficacy data for this age group no dose recommendations can be made. 
Other medicines and Myclausen 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. This includes medicines obtained without a prescription, including herbal medicines. This 
is because Myclausen can affect the way some other medicines work. Also other medicines can affect 
the way Myclausen works. 
In particular, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking any of the following medicines before 
you start Myclausen: 
• 
azathioprine or other medicines that suppress your immune system (given after a transplant 
operation) 
cholestyramine (used to treat high cholesterol) 
rifampicin (an antibiotic used to prevent and treat infections such as tuberculosis (TB)) 
antacids or proton pump inhibitors (used for acid problems in your stomach such as indigestion) 
phosphate binders (used by people with chronic kidney failure to reduce how much phosphate 
gets absorbed into their blood). 
antibiotics (used to treat bacterial infections) 
isavuconazole (used to treat fungal infections) 
telmisartan (used to treat high blood pressure) 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Vaccines 
If you need to have a vaccination (a live vaccine) while taking Myclausen, talk to your doctor or 
pharmacist first. Your doctor will have to advise you on what vaccines you can have. 
You must not donate blood during treatment with Myclausen and for at least 6 weeks after stopping 
treatment. Men must not donate semen during treatment with Myclausen and for at least 90 days after 
stopping treatment.

62 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Before you start taking Myclausen 
During your entire treatment with Myclausen 
For 6 weeks after you stop taking Myclausen. 
Contraception in women taking Myclausen 
If you are a woman who could become pregnant you must use an effective method of contraception 
with Myclausen. This includes: 
• 
• 
• 
Talk to your doctor about the most suitable contraception for you. This will depend on your individual 
situation. Two forms of contraception are preferable as this will reduce the risk of unintended 
pregnancy. Contact your doctor as soon as possible, if you think your contraception may not 
have been effective or if you have forgotten to take your contraceptive pill. 
You cannot become pregnant if any of the following conditions applies to you: 
• 
You are post-menopausal, i.e. at least 50 years old and your last period was more than a year 
ago (if your periods have stopped because you have had treatment for cancer, then there is still a 
chance you could become pregnant) 
Your fallopian tubes and both ovaries have been removed by surgery (bilateral salpingo-
oophorectomy) 
Your womb (uterus) has been removed by surgery (hysterectomy) 
Your ovaries no longer work (premature ovarian failure, which has been confirmed by a 
specialist gynaecologist) 
You were born with one of the following rare conditions that make pregnancy impossible: the 
XY genotype, Turner’s syndrome or uterine agenesis 
You are a child or teenager who has not started having periods. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Contraception in men taking Myclausen 
The available evidence does not indicate an increased risk of malformations or miscarriage if the 
father takes mycophenolate. However, a risk cannot be completely excluded. As a precaution you or 
your female partner  are recommended to use reliable contraception during treatment and for 90 days 
after you stop taking Myclausen. 
If you are planning to have a child, talk to your doctor about the potential risks and alternative 
therapies. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine. Your doctor will talk to you about 
the risks in case of pregnancy and the alternatives you can take to prevent rejection of your transplant 
organ if: 
• 
• 
You plan to become pregnant. 
You miss or think you have missed a period, or you have unusual menstrual bleeding, or suspect 
you are pregnant. 
You have sex without using effective methods of contraception. 
• 
If you do become pregnant during the treatment with mycophenolate, you must inform your doctor 
immediately. However, keep taking Myclausen until you see him or her. 
Pregnancy 
Mycophenolate causes a very high frequency of miscarriage (50%) and of severe birth defects (23 - 
27%) in the unborn baby. Birth defects that have been reported include anomalies of ears, of eyes, of 
face (cleft lip/palate), of development of fingers, of heart, oesophagus (tube that connects the throat 
with the stomach), kidneys and nervous system (for example spina bifida (where the bones of the 
spine are not properly developed).Your baby may be affected by one or more of these. 
If you are a woman who could become pregnant, you must provide a negative pregnancy test before 
starting treatment and must follow the contraception advice given to you by your doctor. Your doctor 
may request more than one test to ensure you are not pregnant before starting treatment. 
63 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
Do not take Myclausen if you are breast-feeding. This is because small amounts of the medicine can 
pass into the mother’s milk. 
Driving and using machines 
Myclausen has a moderate influence on your ability to drive or use any tools or machines. If you feel 
drowsy, numb or confused, talk to your doctor or nurse and do not drive or use any tools or machines 
until you feel better. 
Myclausen contains sodium

essentially ‘sodium-free’

• 
Children may be more likely than adults to have some side effects. These include diarrhoea, infections, 
fewer white cells and fewer red cells in the blood. 
the number of your blood cells or signs of infections 
Fighting infections 
Myclausen reduces your body’s defences. This is to stop you rejecting your transplant. As a result, 
your body will not be as good as normal at fighting infections. This means you may catch more 
infections than usual. This includes infections of the brain, skin, mouth, stomach and gut, lungs and 
urinary system. 
Lymph and skin cancer 
As can happen in patients taking this type of medicine (immune-suppressants), a very small number of 
patients on Myclausen have developed cancer of the lymphoid tissues and skin. 
General unwanted effects 
You may get general side effects affecting your body as a whole. These include serious allergic 
reactions (such as anaphylaxis, angioeodema), fever, feeling very tired, difficulty sleeping, pains (such 
as stomach, chest, joint or muscle), headache, flu symptoms and swelling.

SCIENTIFIC CONCLUSIONS AND GROUNDS FOR THE VARIATION TO THE TERMS

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for mycophenolate mofetil, 
mycophenolic acid, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on de novo purine synthesis inhibitors-associated acute inflammatory 
syndrome from the literature and spontaneous reports, including cases with a close temporal 
relationship, positive de-challenge and re-challenge and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, 
the PRAC considers a causal relationship between mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid and de 
novo purine synthesis inhibitors-associated acute inflammatory syndrome is established. The PRAC 
concluded that the product information of products containing mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic 
acid should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid the CHMP is 
of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing mycophenolate 
mofetil, mycophenolic acid is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

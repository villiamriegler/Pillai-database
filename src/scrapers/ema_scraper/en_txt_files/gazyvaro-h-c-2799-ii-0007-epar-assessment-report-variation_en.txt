Extension of indication to add the treatment of patients with follicular lymphoma based on the results of 
the pivotal study GAO4753g. Consequently, updates to sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 of the SmPC, 
the Package Leaflet and RMP have been proposed. Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity to make 
minor editorial changes to sections 4.4, 4.6, 5.3 and 6.6 of the SmPC. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Gazyvaro was designated as an orphan medicinal product (EU/3/15/1504) in the following indication: 
treatment of follicular lymphoma on 19 June 2015.  
The new indication, which is the subject of this application, falls within the above mentioned orphan 
designation. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included EMA Decisions 
CW/0001/2015 and CW/1/2011 on the granting of a class waiver.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication.

Gazyvaro (Obinutuzumab) is a glyco-engineered, Type II mAb of the immunoglobulin (Ig) IgG1 subclass, 
recognizing an epitope of the CD20 molecule found on B cells (Beers et al, 2008; Herter et al, 2013). It 
was  approved  in  the  EU  for  use  in  combination  with  chlorambucil  in  the  first-line  treatment  of  patients 
with CLL in November 2013. 
B-cell  lymphomas,  including  iNHLs,  are  characterized  by  the  expression  of  a  membrane  antigen,  CD20. 
Non-Hodgkin  lymphoma  are  B-lymphoproliferative  disorders  that  include  a  heterogeneous  group  of 
malignancies,  ranging  from  slow-growing,  indolent  non-Hodgkin  lymphomas  (iNHLs),  which  comprise 
about  a  third  of  all  NHLs,  to  more  aggressive  forms  of  NHL.  Subtypes  of  iNHL  are  follicular  lymphoma 
(FL),  marginal  zone  lymphoma  (MZL),  lymphoplasmacytic  lymphoma  with  or  without  Waldenström’s 
macroglobulinemia  [LPL/WM]  and  small  lymphocytic  lymphoma  (SLL).  FL  accounts  for  approximately 
20%-25% of all new NHLs and 70% of iNHLs (The Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Classification Project 1997). 
SLL  is  an  uncommon  disorder,  comprising  6%  of  iNHLs  and  15%  of  cases  of  the  CLL/SLL  entity 
(Tsimberidou  et  al.  2007;  Nola  et  al.  2004),  classified  as  same  biological  entity  with  CLL  according  to

WHO.  Follicular  lymphoma  (FL)  is  the  second  most  common  lymphoma  diagnosed  in  the  United  States 
and Western Europe, representing approximately 22% of all NHLs and 70% of iNHL. The median age at 
diagnosis is 59 years and median survival is 8-10 years. 
Follicular lymphoma is defined as a mature B-cell neoplasm in the 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) 
classification of tumours of hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. Follicular lymphoma cells are malignant 
counterparts  of  normal  germinal  center  B  cells.  Approximately  85%  of  patients  with  FL  have  a  genomic 
translocation t(14;18)(q32;q21), which results in the overexpression of the BCL-2 protein, a member of a 
family  of  proteins  that  blocks  programmed  cell  death  or  apoptosis.  FL  is  chemo-sensitive  and  with  a 
generally  good  prognosis at  diagnosis,  however  in  resistant  and  refractory  stages  the  current  treatment 
alternatives are limited.  
Rituximab  (Mabthera)  a  monoclonal  antibody  (mAb)  directed  against  CD20,  has  been  authorised  in  the 
EU  as  monotherapy  for  patients  with  stage  III-IV  FL  who  are  chemoresistant  or  are  in  their  second  or 
subsequent relapse after chemotherapy; improved progression-free survival (PFS) or event-free survival 
(EFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with FL (Hiddemann et al, 2005; Herold et al, 2007; Marcus et 
al,  2008;  Salles  et  al,  2008)  has  been  shown.  Improved  efficacy  has  also  been  demonstrated  with 
rituximab  in  patients  with  MZL  and  SLL  (McLaughlin  et  al.  1998;  Foran  et  al.  2000;  Hainsworth  et  al. 
2003; Rummel et al. 2013).  
Data from a range of clinical trials suggest that the quality and duration of response to induction therapy 
are  factors  that  predict  survival  in  patients  with  previously  untreated  and  relapsed  FL;  patients  who 
achieve a complete response that is maintained for a prolonged period of time tend to survive longer than 
other  patients.  As  a  result,  there  has  been  much  interest in  post-induction  therapy  for  patients  with  FL. 
Two  main  approaches  have  been  evaluated:  consolidation,  consisting  of  a  single  or  short  course  of 
therapy; and maintenance, in which treatment is continued for a prolonged period of time (theoretically 
until relapse, but in practice, usually limited to around 2 years).  
In the European Union, rituximab maintenance for up to 2 years is approved for patients with previously 
untreated FL and for patients with relapsed/refractory FL, after induction therapy. This has been shown to 
have  an  acceptable  safety  profile  in  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  disease  and  in  patients  with 
relapsed/refractory  disease.  Based  on  a  systematic  meta-analysis,  rituximab  maintenance  has  been 
shown  to  substantially  prolong  PFS  and  OS  even  after  antibody  containing  induction  (although  the  OS 
benefit  was  only  shown  in  relapsed  patients  who  did  not  receive  rituximab  during  first-line  induction 
treatment).  Both  ESMO  and  the  NCCN  guidelines  indicate  that  the  efficacy  of  maintenance  rituximab  in 
the second-line setting is likely to be influenced by the efficacy of maintenance rituximab in the first-line 
setting.  The  NCCN  guidelines  state  that  if  a  patient  progressed  during  or  within  6  months  of  first  line 
maintenance rituximab, the clinical benefit of maintenance rituximab in the second-line setting is likely to 
be very minimal and ESMO guidelines state that second-line maintenance rituximab probably should not 
be used for patients who had relapsed during their first maintenance period. 
Radioimmunotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy have all been investigated as potential forms of 
post-induction  therapy  in  patients  with  FL  in  the  first-line  and/or  relapsed/refractory  setting;  90Y-
ibritutomab tiuxetan is approved as consolidation therapy for patients with FL in first remission but not in 
the  relapsed/refractory  setting.  Interferon-alpha  (for  18  months)  is  licensed  as  an  adjunct  to  induction 
combination chemotherapy such as a CHOP-like regimen, for patients with FL and a high tumour burden, 
but  its  use  is  limited  by  toxicity  and  inconvenience  of  administration.  Relatively  few  studies  have  been 
conducted with maintenance chemotherapy and this is not established in FL. 
As  the  disease  becomes  increasingly  resistant  to  chemotherapy  and  to  rituximab  as  well  as  histologic 
transformation to high-grade NHL can occur which are more aggressive than the original iNHL and has a 
poor  outcome.  Overall,  about  50%  of  patients  with  FL  die  within  5  years  of  first  relapse/progression

(Montoto et al. 2004; Causoli et al, 2015), but the median OS of patients with FL who develop histological 
transformation is estimated to 1-2 years (Al-Tourah et al. 2008).  
The  alkylating  agent  bendamustine  has  been  shown  to  be  effective  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with 
rituximab-refractory  iNHL,  demonstrating  an  overall  response  rate  (ORR)  of  approximately  75%,  a 
complete response (CR) rate of approximately 15%, a median DoR of 6.7-9.2 months, and a median PFS 
of  7.1-9.3  months  (Friedberg  et  al.  2008;  Kahl  et  al.  2010).  As  disease  remissions  are  relatively  short 
with bendamustine, there is still a medical need for new therapeutic options for patients with iNHL after 
failure of rituximab-based therapy.  
The MAH applied to extend the indication as follows: 
Gazyvaro  (Obinutuzumab)  in  combination  with  bendamustine  followed  by  Gazyvaro  (Obinutuzumab) 
maintenance is indicated for the treatment of patients with follicular lymphoma who did not respond to or 
who  progressed  during  or  up  to  6  months  after  treatment  with  rituximab  or  a  rituximab-containing 
regimen. 
The recommended dose of Gazyvaro (Obinutuzumab) when used in combination with Bendamustine is 
1000 mg as an intravenous infusion on day 1, 8 and 15 of cycle 1, on day 1 of cycles 2-6, and then every 
2 months thereafter until progression or for up to 2 years (whichever was earlier). 
The  proposed  indication,  falls  within  the  orphan  designation:  treatment  of  follicular  lymphoma 
(EU/3/15/1504, granted on 19 June 2015). 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
All  relevant  pharmacology  studies,  multiple  dose  PK  and  TK  studies  as  well  as  toxicology  studies 
conducted  in  support  of  obinutuzumab  development  were  included  in  the  initial  license  application.  Two 
additional toxicology studies contributing to the overall evaluation of the obinutuzumab safety profile and 
relevant  to this  application  were  completed  since  submission  of  the  initial  license  application  in  CLL  and 
are discussed here in the context of the overall toxicology program.  
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Two supplemental in vitro studies were performed post-approval. 
To exclude that the unexpected staining of endothelial cells observed in human and monkey tissue cross-
reactivity studies could indicate a direct binding of obinutuzumab to endothelial cells leading to vasculitis 
in macaques, an additional study was submitted (Report No. 1061540) using different tissue donors (see 
toxicology section). In addition, another in vitro toxicology study (Report No. 1062523) was designed to 
explore  the  role  of  cytokine  release  in  the  increased  infusion-related  reactions  (IRR)  incidence  and 
severity observed in obinutuzumab-treated versus rituximab-treated patients.  
2.2.2.  Pharmacology 
No new pharmacology studies were included in this submission. 
2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new PK studies were included in this submission.

2.2.4.  Toxicology  
Other toxicity studies 
Report No. 1061540: A Tissue cross-reactivity study of obinutuzumab in normal human and cynomolgus 
monkey tissues  
The  objective  of  this  study  was  to  determine  the  potential  cross  reactivity  of  RO5072759  with 
cryosections of human and non-human primate (cynomolgus monkey) tissues. 
Tissues were collected as surgical or autopsy specimens from humans (Table 1) and necropsy specimens 
from  cynomolgus  monkeys.  Unfixed  tissues  as  received  from  the  tissue  suppliers  were  considered 
essentially  normal.  Tissues  were  from  a  different  set  of  human  and  cynomolgus  donors  (at  least  3 
different donors per tissue) and the secondary labelled antibody used was different than in the previous 
studies; all other assay procedures were similar to the earlier studies.  
Table 1 Human tissue (normal) from three separate donors. 
Table 2 Cynomolgus monkey tissue (normal) from three separate animals 
After  pathology  review,  it  was  determined  that  some  of  the  tissue  samples  did  not  contain  a  sufficient 
amount  of  the  required  tissue  for  evaluation  or  were  determined  to  be  unsuitable  for  evaluation  due  to 
tissue morphology. Therefore, additional samples of the tissue were stained and evaluated to obtain the

required  three  samples  of  each  tissue;  however,  there  were  only  two  viable  donors  of  cervix  evaluated 
within the study timeframe.  
In  the  human  tissue  panel,  obinutuzumab  showed  membrane  and  cytoplasmic  staining  of  mononuclear 
leukocytes 
(B 
lymphocytes) 
and 
cytoplasmic 
staining  was 
seen 
in 
endothelium, 
epithelium/myoepithelium,  and  platelets.  In  cynomolgus  monkey  tissues,  cytoplasmic  staining  was 
observed  in  endothelium,  epithelium,  cerebellar  granular  layer  cells  and  neural  processes,  and  skin 
follicular root sheaths.  
The  cytoplasmic  staining  of  endothelial  cells  was  observed  in  a  similar  range  of  tissues  between  human 
and  monkey  tissues,  with  no  membranous  endothelial  staining  being  observed  in  either  species.  In 
contrast  to  the  previous  TCR  studies  performed  with  RO5072759,  there  was  no  membrane  staining 
observed, in neither human nor cynomolgus monkey tissues, except for B lymphocytes.  
In  conclusion,  data  from  the  new  TCR  study  demonstrated  lack  of  membranous  staining  of  endothelial 
cells  and,  according  to  the  MAH,  provided  additional  data  to  confirm  the  inherent  variability  of  the 
unexpected  staining  and  to  support  the  lack  of  any  direct effect  of  obinutuzumab  on  endothelial  cells  in 
vivo. 
The  results  of  this  study  may  support  that  the  unexpected  staining  of  endothelial  cells  observed  in 
previous  human  and  monkey  tissue  cross-reactivity  studies,  may  not  indicate  a  direct  binding  of 
obinutuzumab to endothelial cells leading to vasculitis in macaques.  
Report  No.  1062523:  Obinutuzumab  Rituximab-  and  Ofatumumab-induced  cytokine  release  in  human 
whole blood) 
This  additional  whole  blood  cell  assay  was  designed  to  explore  the  role  of  cytokine  release  in  the 
increased  IRR  rate  and  severity  observed  in  obinutuzumab-treated  versus  rituximab-treated  patients. 
Whole  blood  from  13  healthy  donors  was  incubated  with  0.1,  1,  10  and  100  ug/mL  obinutuzumab,  and 
other  CD20  antibodies  rituximab  and  ofatumumab,  as  well  as  the  comparators  alemtuzumab  and 
cetuximab.  After  24  hours  IL6,  IL8,  TNFα,  IFNγ,  interleutkin-2  (IL2),  interleukin-12p70  (IL12p70), 
interleukin-1  beta  (IL1β),  interleukin-1  alpha  (IL1α)  and  interleukin-10  (IL10)  released  into  the  plasma 
was measured. In addition, immunophenotyping was performed to identify changes in the numbers of B 
cells,  T  cells  and  NK  cells.  Additionally  expression  of  the  activation  marker  CD11b  on  neutrophils  was 
monitored.  Obinutuzumab  induced  stronger  cytokine  release,  increased  up-regulation  of  CD11b  and 
stronger B cell depletion than rituximab and ofatumumab in this assay.  
2.2.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No environmental risk assessement was submitted (See discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.2.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The active substance in Gazyvaro, obinutuzumab, is a monoclonal antibody that has been designed using 
recombinant DNA technology to recognise and attach to the protein CD20, which is found on the surface 
of  all  B-lymphocytes.  In  the  current  indication,  CLL,  cancerous  B-  lymphocytes  multiply  too  quickly  and 
replace the normal cells in the bone marrow, and are unable to function properly. By attaching to CD20 
on B-lymphocytes of patients with CLL, obinutuzumab causes the death of these abnormal lymphocytes.  
All  relevant  pharmacology  studies,  multiple  dose  PK  and  TK  studies  as  well  as  toxicology  studies 
conducted  in  support  of  obinutuzumab  development  were  included  in  the  initial  license  application.  Two 
additional toxicology studies contributing to the overall evaluation of the obinutuzumab safety profile and 
relevant  to this  application  were  completed  since  submission  of  the  initial  license  application  in  CLL  and 
Assessment report

are discussed here in the context of the overall toxicology program.  
Obinutuzumab was evaluated in repeat-dose studies in cynomolgus monkeys up to 26 weeks in duration. 
Cynomolgus monkey was selected as the species of choice in the safety assessment of obinutuzumab on 
the  basis  of  its  high  target  sequence  homology  and  comparable  target  binding  affinities  to  human,  Fc-
mediated effector function, and tissue cross-reactivity results.  
Toxicology studies were conducted in monkeys at dose levels ranging from 5 to 100 mg/kg body weight 
i.v. Treatment-related findings across all toxicology studies were related to the pharmacological action of 
obinutuzumab, to secondary opportunistic infections and/or to hypersensitivity reactions.  
An enhanced pre- and postnatal development study revealed a complete depletion of B-lymphocytes in all 
infants with a return to almost normal levels by 168 days postpartum, indicating that a long-lasting effect 
of treatment on immune function is unlikely. There was no evidence of any treatment-related effects on 
embryo-fetal development, parturition, postnatal survival, and growth and development of infants. 
In  vitro  assays  using  undiluted  human  whole  blood  measured  significant  increases  in  cytokine  secretion 
caused by obinutuzumab, indicating that obinutuzumab has the propensity to cause first infusion-related 
cytokine release in patients.  
Immunohistochemical  staining  in  frozen  cynomolgus  monkey  and  human  tissue  sections  was  in  general 
comparable with the reported tissue expression of CD20. However, cross reactivity of obinutuzumab was 
also  present  in  human  bile  duct  epithelia,  salivary  glands,  and  endothelium  of  the  lung  as  well  as  on 
membrane and cytoplasm of monkey endothelium in the following tissues: small intestine, heart, kidney, 
lung, ovary, pancreas, pituitary, prostate, salivary gland, testis, and endometrium.  
Two supplementary toxicology studies (ex vivo and in vitro) were submitted for this extension application.  
To exclude that the unexpected staining of endothelial cells observed in human and monkey tissue cross-
reactivity studies could indicate a direct binding of obinutuzumab to endothelial cells leading to vasculitis 
in macaques. One study investigated the potential cross reactivity of obinutuzumab with cryosections of 
human  and  non-human  primate  (cynomolgus  monkey)  tissues.  The  objective  was  to  exclude  that  the 
unexpected  staining  of  endothelial  cells  observed  in  previous  human  and  monkey  tissue  cross-reactivity 
studies could indicate a direct binding of obinutuzumab to endothelial cells and that this in turn could lead 
to vasculitis in macaques.  
The  results  of  the  new  study  demonstrated  obinutuzumab  staining  of  membrane  and  cytoplasmic 
elements  in  mononuclear  leukocytes  in  B  cell  regions  of  lymphoid  tissues,  in  hematopoietic  cells  and  in 
individual  mononuclear  leukocytes  in  multiple  tissues  in  both  human  and  cynomolgus  monkey  tissue 
panels. 
In  addition,  cytoplasmic  staining  with  obinutuzumab  was  seen 
in  endothelium, 
epithelium/myoepithelium,  and  platelets  in  the  human  tissue  panel.  In  cynomolgus  monkey  tissues, 
cytoplasmic staining was observed in endothelium, epithelium, cerebellar granular layer cells and neural 
processes, and skin follicular root sheaths.  
According  to  ICH  S6,  binding  to  areas  not  typically  accessible  to  the  antibody  in  vivo  i.e.  cytoplasm,  is 
generally not toxicologically relevant. This is also underscored by the MAH regarding the results from this 
study, and this assumption may be endorsed. Thus, the results may support that the unexpected staining 
of  endothelial  cells  observed  in  previous  human  and  monkey  tissue  cross-reactivity  studies,  may  not 
indicate a direct binding of obinutuzumab to endothelial cells leading to vasculitis in macaques.  
The  mechanism  by  which  infusion-related  reactions  (IRRs)  are  triggered  is  not  clearly  understood, 
however,  evidence  suggests  that  IRRs  may  be  linked  to  the  release  of  cytokines  and/or  other  chemical 
mediators  from  immune  effector  cells  such  as  NK  cells,  macrophages/monocytes  and/or  neutrophils; 
potentially also from B-cells targeted by obinutuzumab. Cytokine release can occur as a consequence of 
the  antibody-antigen  interaction  between  obinutuzumab  and  the  CD20  antigen  on  B  lymphocytes,

resulting  in  Fc  receptor  crosslinking  of  FcγRIII  on  immune  effector  cells  such  as  natural  killer  cells  and 
macrophages/monocytes  and  subsequent  cytokine  release  from  these  cells.  An  in  vitro  study  was 
designed to explore the role of cytokine release in the increased infusion-related reactions (IRR) incidence 
and severity observed in obinutuzumab-treated versus rituximab-treated patients. Obinutuzumab induced 
stronger cytokine release, increased up-regulation of CD11b and stronger B cell depletion than rituximab 
and  ofatumumab,  when  incubated  with  whole  blood  from  healthy  donors.  These  data  are  in  alignment 
with  the  clinical  trial  CLL11/BO21004  in  CLL  patients  where  obinutuzumab  was  found  to  have  greater 
efficacy than Rituximab, albeit with more severe and increased incidence of IRR. 
In accordance with the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human 
Use”, EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2*, an environmental risk assessment (ERA) is required for all new 
marketing  authorisation  applications  for  a  medicinal  product  through  a  centralised,  mutual  recognition, 
decentralised  or  national  procedure,  including  extensions  to  already  marketed  products.  In  the  case  of 
products  containing  vitamins,  electrolytes,  amino  acids,  peptides,  proteins,  carbohydrates  and  lipids  as 
active  pharmaceutical  ingredient(s),  an  ERA  should  be  provided.  This  ERA  may  consist  of  a  justification 
for not submitting ERA studies, e.g. due to their nature they are unlikely to result in a significant risk to 
the  environment.  The  active  ingredient  in  GAZYVARO,  Obinutuzumab,  is  a  glyco-engineered  Type  II 
humanised  anti-CD20  monoclonal  antibody  of  the  IgG1  subclass,  therefore  it  is  exempted.  The 
justification is that as a protein, Obinutuzumab is categorically exempt from the necessity of an ERA. This 
is agreed.  
2.2.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical aspects of obinutuzumab are sufficiently covered in the original submission for the MA 
and by the updated data submitted in this application.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
PK  investigations  in  patients  with  iNHL  in  order  to  support  dose  /  posology  and  to  explore  DDI 
interactions  with  bendamustine  have  been  included  in  study  GAO4753g.  A  drug  –drug  interaction  sub-
study is part of study GAO4753g. This sub-study included 20 patients with intensive sampling operated in 
day 2 of cycle one in order to. A formal non compartment analysis (NCA) of plasma/serum concentrations 
of bendamustine was followed in this portion of the study.

Methods 
Analytical Methods 
The ELISA technique for the quantification of obinutuzumab in human serum was the same as used in the 
original  application.  Bendamustine  concentrations  were  measured  in  human  Li-heparin  plasma  samples 
using  a  validated  LC-MS/MS  method.  Briefly,  human  plasma  samples  were  analyzed  using  deuterated 
bendamustine  (bendamustine-d8-HCL)  as  an  internal  standard,  and  performing  protein  precipitation. 
Analysis  was  performed  by  high  performance  liquid  chromatography  with  tandem  mass  spectrometric 
detection  (API  3000,  PE  Sciex)  operated  in  the  positive  ion  mode.  Separation  was  performed  on  a 
reversed  phase 
(C18,  50 
-  2.1  mm,  3.0  μm  particle  size)  analytical  column  using 
methanol/acetonitrile/water/formic  acid  as  the  mobile  phase.  The  retention  time  of  bendamustine  was 
approximately 1.15 minutes. 
PK and statistical analysis 
Obinutuzumab 
PK  of  Obinutuzumab  has  been  characterized  in  earlier  development  using  basically  population-PK 
modelling approach. 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/345935/2016 
Page 12/82 
 
  
  
 
 
The  population  PK  analysis  was  conducted  via  nonlinear  mixed-effects  modeling  with  software  NONMEM 
7.3.0. The PK data from studies BO20999, BO21000, BO21003, and BO21004 were assessed previously 
as this analysis was part of the documentation submitted in the CLL application.  
In  this  application,  the  base  model  developed  in  the  original  report  was  used  as  a  starting  point  but 
refined by the inclusion of data collected in studies GAO4753g and also study GAO4915g for the current 
analysis.  The  structured  model  was  first  established  then  followed  by  the  development  of  the  covariate 
model.  Model  evaluation  was  performed  using  informative  graphics  and  various  predictive  check 
simulations.  
The final population PK model was used to calculate (using Bayesian posthoc parameters) and summarize 
the  individual  derived  PK  parameters  (terminal  half-life  [t1/2,term],  effective  half-life  [t1/2,eff],  CLinf, 
central volume [V1], and volume of steady-state [VSS]). Terminal and effective half-life were computed 
at steady-state when time-dependent clearance has already decreased to zero [Lötsch et al. 2002]. 
For  all  patients  in  the  analysis  dataset,  the  individual  concentration-time  courses  were  simulated  using 
patients’ individual PK parameters estimated from the model. For each time point, median concentration 
and  90%  prediction  interval  were  computed  and  illustrated  graphically.  Two  dosing  regimens  were 
simulated: iNHL dosing regimen implemented in Study GAO4753g (1000 mg IV dosing every 4 weeks for 
24 weeks, with the additional 1000 mg IV doses at days 8 and 15, and then 1000 mg every 2 months) 
and DLBCL dosing regimen implemented in Study GAO4915g (1000 mg IV dosing every 3  weeks for 24 
weeks,  with  the  additional  1000  mg  IV  doses  at  days  8  and  15).  For important  covariates,  the effect  of 
covariates  was  illustrated  by  comparison  of  concentrations  over  time  for  subsets  of  patients  with  the 
respective covariate values (or categories). The predicted individual exposure measures (Cmax, Ctrough, 
and  AUCτ  with  τ  =21,  28,  or  60  days,  depending  on  the  dosing  regimen)  at  the  last  dosing  cycle 
(separately for Induction and Maintenance periods for iNHL regimen) were computed and summarized by 
important covariates. 
For  the  FL  indication  and  similarly  to  the  sensitivity  analysis  performed  for  patients  with  CLL  in  the 
original report, sensitivity analyses were performed for patients with iNHL, FL, or DLBCL by refitting the 
model  to  the  data  associated  to  those  diseases  only,  separately  for  each,  and  comparison  of  model 
parameters and predictions with the final model. Individual predicted PK parameters were summarized by 
disease  types  and  iNHL  subtypes.  Individual  concentrations  and  exposure  measures  were  simulated  for 
the iNHL and DLBCL dosing regimens, and summarized by disease types, iNHL subtypes, and covariates 
as described above. 
Bendamustine 
The study included a DDI sub-study to explore the impact of obinutuzumab on the PK of bendamustine. 
This  sub-study  included  20  patients  who  underwent  intensive  PK  sampling  on  Day  2  of  Cycle  1  at  the 
following  times:  pre-bendamustine  infusion,  immediately  after  the  end  of  the  infusion,  and  then  15,  30 
and  45  minutes,  and  1,  2,  3  and  6  hours  after the end  of  the  bendamustine infusion.  Bendamustine  PK 
was  assessed  in  10  patients  who  received  bendamustine  in  combination  with  obinutuzumab  and  a 
comparison was made to bendamustine PK in 10 patients who received bendamustine alone. The impact 
of  bendamustine  on  obinutuzumab  PK  was  not  assessed.  Due  to  the  different  dose  regimens  for 
bendamustine in the 2 treatment arms, AUCinf and Cmax were dose-normalized to enable comparison.

The pharmacokinetics of monoclonal antibodies is usually described by a two-compartment model, either 
linear or with target-mediated disposition. The original population PK model of obinutuzumab was a two-
compartment linear model with time-dependent clearance. In this model, clearance was the sum of non-
specific  time-independent  clearance  (CLinf)  and  time-dependent  clearance  (CLt)  that  exponentially 
decreased with time. The base model developed in the original analysis was a starting point for the model 
development.  The  model  included  body-size  dependences  for  all  model  parameters  using  allometric 
scaling with the estimated power coefficients. 
Model parameters 
The parameters and the precision of their estimation are tabulated below. 
Table 2 Parameter Estimates for Base Model 003imp 
The  suitability  of  the  model  was  evaluated  using  graphical  evaluation  and  statistics  and  precision  of 
parameters estimates. 
The full model 171imp (including all available data) was refined by the re-estimation of the model 
parameters using a larger dataset including all available data (see Table 1 for details on datasets). The 
final population PK model was used to calculate (using Bayesian posthoc parameters) for each patients 
the individual derived PK parameters. The data obtained are summarized below for each patients group.

The  final  model  was  refitted  with  only  FL data  (called  FL  model, Model  171impD6).  These  data included 
8545 samples from 406 patients with FL. Comparison of the predictions (PRED and IPRED) and goodness-
of-fit  between  the  final  and  FL  models  show  that  the  population  predictions  are  very  similar,  and 
individual predictions are nearly identical.  
Obinutuzumab  PKs  in  FL  patients  could  be  considered  elucidated.  The  drug  exhibits  typical  “Target 
Mediated  Drug  Disposition”  (TMDD)  PK  behavior  of  anti-tumoural  antibodies.  The  concentration-time 
course  of  obinutuzumab  is  adequately  described  by  a  two-compartment  PK  model  with  non-linear  time-
dependent  clearance  and  steady-state  PK  parameters  typical  for  a  mAb.  Obinutuzumab  clearance  was 
described  as  the  sum  of  steady-state  (time-independent)  clearance  and  time-dependent  clearance  that 
decreased exponentially with time on treatment. 
The  original  population  PK  analysis  of  obinutuzumab  that  was  based  on  CLL  and  NHL  data  accurately 
described the PK of obinutuzumab. The parameters of the updated population PK model (model imp171 
and imp171D) and the precision of their estimation, which included the data from studies GAO4753g and 
GAO4915g, were basically similar between the three models. Despite slight differences sensitivity analysis 
showed that the PK characteristics of obinutuzumab in patients with iNHL were similar to the PK findings 
in the combined population.

Following  IV  administration  of  bendamustine,  plasma  data  indicated  a  rapid  elimination  with  a  half-life 
(t1/2)  of  24.6  minutes  and  28.6  minutes,  when  bendamustine  was  given  alone  and  in  combination, 
respectively. There were no meaningful differences observed for bendamustine AUCinf and Cmax (dose-
normalized) between the 2 treatment arms (the 95% CI for the ratio of geometric means includes 1). In 
addition, there were no meaningful differences in bendamustine t1/2, clearance or volume of distribution 
between  the  2  treatment  arms.  Inter-subject  variability  was  high  with  coefficients  of  variation  (CV) 
ranging between 65.3−87.7% for Cmax and AUCinf (Table 9). 
The  DDI  sub-study  is  insufficiently  powered  to  allow  any  reliable  conclusions  regarding  the  influence  of 
obinutuzumab  co-administration  on  the  bendamustine  PKs.  This  is  clearly  illustrated  by  the  95%  CI  of 
Cmax  and  AUCinf  ratios  shown  above.  However,  it  is  recognized  that  the  occurrence  of  such  PK 
interaction is not plausible. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The  primary  pharmacodynamic  effect  of  obinutuzumab  is  depletion  of  B  cells  and  their  subsequent 
recovery  in  the  peripheral  blood.  In  all  studies,  a  rapid  depletion  of  B  cells  was  observed  following  the 
first  obinutuzumab  administration,  which  was  maintained  over  the  treatment  cycles  and  follow-up. 
Human Anti-Human Antibodies (HAHA) for obinutuzumab and Human Anti-Chimeric Antibodies (HACA) for 
rituximab were evaluated in the G-Benda arm of the study. 
B- Cell depletion 
In Study GAO4753g, blood samples for immunophenotyping of B-cells were only assessed in patients in 
the G-benda arm (N =194).  
B-cell depletion was defined as CD19-positive B-cell counts <0.07x109/L occurring after at least one dose 
of obinutuzumab had been administered. Time to depletion was defined as the number of days between 
the first intake of obinutuzumab and the date of the first CD19-positive B-cell count of <0.07x109/L. The 
extent  of  CD19+B-cell  depletion  was  defined  as  the  lowest  absolute  counts  for  the  individual  (i.e.,  the 
nadir) across all visits. 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/345935/2016 
Page 18/82 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
B-cell  recovery  was  defined  as  a  CD19-positive  B-cell  count  >0.07x109/L,  in  a  patient  whose  previous 
CD19-positive  B-cell  count  measurement  revealed  B-cell  depletion.  B-cell  recovery  was  considered 
possible only after the patient had completed study treatment. 
The time to B-cell recovery was defined as the time from B-cell depletion until B-cell recovery. 
Of the 121 patients who had a CD19-positive B-cell result, 116 (96%) patients had B-cell depletion at the 
last  obinutuzumab  administration.  B-cell  recovery  could  not  be  assessed  because  of  the  low  number  of 
patients  who  have  been  followed  for  a  sufficient  length  of  time.  At  6-12  months  after  the  last 
obinutuzumab administration, only 26 patients had a B-cell assessment, and the B-cells had recovered in 
1 of the 26 patients. Very few patients were available for B-cell assessment after 12 months. Considering 
only  patients  with  documented  recovery  at  the  time  of  the  data  cutoff,  the  median  time  from  the  last 
antibody administration (LAA) to B-cell recovery was 660 days (~1.8 years) (range: 1- 746 days). 
In  study  GAO4753g  immunophenotyping  of  B-cells  was  performed  in  G-benda  arm  patients  only.  As 
bendamustine is expected to cause T-cell suppression, immunophenotyping of B-cells was not performed 
in the benda arm of the GAO4753g study. 
Immunogenicity 
HAHA (anti obinutuzumab antibody) 
Among the 175 patients validly tested for HAHA at baseline (day-1, cycle-1) two patients were positive, in 
the G-benda arm (both at 1:10 titre) and both patients had an IRR the same day.  
No patients had a positive HAHA result for anti-obinutuzumab antibodies after Cycle 1, Day 1. 
The observed concentration time courses for the one patient with HAHA  who  continued to receive study 
treatment was similar to that of patients without detected HAHA.  
The  occurrence  of  HAHA  evidenced  in  study  GAO4753g  (2  patients  among  175)  is  unexpectedly  much 
lower than that observed in study BO21004 (17 patients among 286).  
HACA: (Anti-rituxumab antibodies) 
As  all  patients  participating  in  the  trial  had  previously  been  exposed  to  rituximab,  human  anti-chimeric 
antibodies (HACA) for rituximab were also assessed. At baseline, 13 patients (7.4%) in the G-benda arm 
had  a  positive  HACA  result,  including  one  of  the  patients  described  above.  Two  of  these  patients 
experienced Grade 3-4 IRRs on Cycle 1, Day 1. 
Table 3: HACA positivity in study GAO4753g study. 
13  patients  (7.4%)  were  positive  for  HACA.  Among  them,  2  patients  experienced  grade  3-4  IRRs.  The 
current  EU  SmPC  includes  the  appropriate  special  warning  and  precautions  with  regards  to  IRR  risk  as 
well  as  the  appropriate  recommendations  for  dosing,  premedication,  prophylaxis  monitoring  and

management  of  patients  experiencing  IRRs.  Therefore,  no  additional  prophylaxis  and  premedication  is 
proposed.

2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Exposure-Efficacy relationships 
An attempt to characterize the exposure-Efficacy relationship in the pivotal GAO4753g study was made in 
the  population  PK  analysis  detailed  above.  The  analyses,  similar  to  the  analysis  performed  for  patients 
with CLL in study BO21004, were conducted separately for iNHL patients from Study GAO4753g and for 
DLBCL patients from Study GAO4915g. The objectives of the graphical analysis of the exposure-efficacy 
relationships of obinutuzumab for patients with iNHL (Study GAO4753g) were: 
- 
- 
To assess the relationships between the drug exposure and efficacy measures such as BOR, PFS, 
and OS and 
To assess the relationships between the drug exposure and pharmacodynamics parameters of the 
drug effect such as the observed tumour size and B-cell counts.  
Exposure – efficacy relationships 
There was high variability in time of achieving the complete response (CR), and median time to CR was 
close  to  200  days.  Median  Cmean  appeared  to  be  higher  in  subjects  with  CR,  compared  to  subjects  in 
other response groups, both overall and in subjects with low baseline tumour size.  
For PFS, subjects with events had a slightly lower median Cmean compared to subjects without events, 
overall  and  for  subjects  with  high  baseline  tumour  size;  the  distributions  of  Cmean  were  similar  for 
subjects with low baseline tumour size. Among subjects with events, there were no differences in event 
times for subjects in different exposure tertiles (Figure 3). Kaplan-Meier plots (Figure 4) suggested that 
PFS was similar in medium and high exposure groups, and was lower in the low tertile of exposure. The 
effect  was  mostly  due  to  the  lower  survival  in  the  lowest  exposure  category  for  patients  with  high 
baseline tumour size. 
For progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS), patients in higher exposure categories (medium and 
high tertiles of exposure) had longer survival compared to patients in lowest exposure tertile; the effect 
was  mostly  due  to  shorter  survival  in  the  lowest  exposure  tertile  in  patients  with  high  baseline  tumour 
size (figures 5 & 6).

Tumour  size  reduction  compared  to  baseline  was  slightly  greater  in  patients  showing  higher 
obinutuzumab exposure (80%, 85%, and 90% in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd tertiles, respectively) (figure 7); 
however  this  result  is  confounded  with  slightly  higher  baseline  tumour  size  in  the  lower  categories  of 
exposure. 
Patients  with  complete  response  appeared  to  have  higher  exposure  compared  to  patients  in  other 
response categories, overall and in patients with low (below median value) baseline tumour size.

The finding of a potential trend of increased efficacy parameters (change of tumour size, BOR, and PFS) 
in the medium and high exposure groups is similar to the results of the previous analysis for patients with 
CLL. It is important to note that for both iNHL and CLL patients this trend was observed for relationships 
unadjusted for key baseline prognostic factors. Thus, it could be due to potential confounding of exposure 
and  prognosis  of  patients.  The  performed  graphical  analysis  stratified  patients  only  by  baseline  tumour 
size and not by other prognostic factors. This could represent a limitation of the methodology used in the 
analysis. 
Similar graphical Exposure-Efficacy analyses have been conducted for the subpopulation of patients with 
FL in the GAO4753g study. 
As  seen  in  the  overall  population  of  patients  with  iNHL,  the  efficacy  (PFS)  of  obinutuzumab-containing 
therapy  in  patients  with  FL  appeared  to  be  greater  in  patients  with  highest  exposure  to  obinutuzumab 
than in patients with lower exposure to obinutuzumab. This finding was consistent with expectations since 
patients with FL made up the majority (almost 90%) of patients in the iNHL population in the GAO4753g 
study  which  were  included  in  the  exposure-PFS  analysis.  It  is  important  to  note  that  those  Exposure-
Efficacy  graphical  analyses  were  not  adjusted  for  prognostic  factors  at  baseline  other  than  baseline 
tumour  size.  Therefore,  the  apparent  association  between  higher  exposure  to  obinutuzumab  and  better 
PFS could be due to confounding factors, such as differences in tumour burden, body weight, and other 
baseline  demographic  and  prognostic  factors.  Further  analyses  of  PFS/OS  and  exposure  in  patients  with 
FL  (i.e.,  Cox  regression  analyses),  has  been  conducted.  Overall  the  results  of  the  exposure  efficacy 
analyses in the FL population are consistent with the ones obtained in the iNHL population. 
Exposure-Safety relationships 
Exposure-safety  relationship  has  been  extensively  investigated  using  the  population-PK  modelled 
analysis. Data from all patients enrolled in the G-benda arm receiving at least one dose has included in 
the  analysis.  No  clear  relationship  between  exposure  level  and  the  occurrence  of  any  SAE  has  been 
evidenced. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Obinutuzumab  exhibits  typical  “Target  Mediated  Drug  Disposition”  (TMDD)  PK  behavior  of  anti-tumoural 
antibodies.  The  concentration-time  course  of  obinutuzumab  is  adequately  described  by  a  two-
compartment PK model with non-linear time-dependent clearance and steady-state PK parameters typical 
for  a  mAb.  Obinutuzumab  clearance  was  described  as  the  sum  of  steady-state  (time-independent) 
clearance and time-dependent clearance that decreased exponentially with time on treatment. 
The  original  population  PK  analysis  of  obinutuzumab  that  was  based  on  CLL  and  NHL  data  accurately 
described the PK of obinutuzumab. The parameters of the updated population PK model (model imp171 
and imp171D) and the precision of their estimation, which included the data from studies GAO4753g and 
GAO4915g, were similar between the three models. Despite slight differences sensitivity analysis showed 
that  the  PK  characteristics  of  obinutuzumab  in  patients  with  iNHL  were  similar  to  the  PK  findings  in  the 
combined population.  
Interference  with  other  co-administered  medication  has  been  tested  in  the  intitial  submission.  No 
significant 
interference  of 
these  medications  (chlorambucil,  bendamustine,  cyclophosphamide, 
prednisone, vincristine doxorubicine, and fludarabine) with the method performances has been detected. 
The  DDI  sub-study  included  in  this  submission  is  insufficiently  powered  to  allow  any  reliable  conclusion 
regarding  the  influence  of  obinutuzumab  co-administration  on  the  bendamustine  PKs.  This  is  clearly 
illustrated  by  the  95%  CI  of  Cmax  and  AUCinf  ratios  shown  above.  However,  it  is  recognized  that  the 
occurrence of such PK interaction is not plausible.

Occurrence of HAHA in the GAO4753g study is low, however it is medically/scientifically plausible that the 
lower  incidence  of  HAHA  could  be  due  to  the  fact  that  these  patients  had  all  been  heavily  treated  with 
immunosuppressive  medication  or  to  inherent  differences  between  iNHL  and  CLL  in  immunological 
reactivity. However, it is also possible that the difference in incidence of HAHAs with the supportive study 
is  simply  due  to  differences  in  the  frequency  and  timing  of  HAHA  sampling  relative  to  completion  of 
obinutuzumab  therapy,  and  to  the  difference  in  number  of  patients  sampled  post-obinutuzumab 
treatment.  Data  to  date  do  not  suggest  a  correlation  between  HAHAs  and  disease  progression  in  the 
GAO4753g study but these data need to be interpreted with care because most patients progressed on or 
soon after receiving obinutuzumab, and detection of HAHAs may be unreliable in this context. 
As  seen  in  the  overall  population  of  patients  with  iNHL,  the  efficacy  (PFS)  of  obinutuzumab-containing 
therapy  in  patients  with  FL  appeared  to  be  greater  in  patients  with  highest  exposure  to  obinutuzumab 
than in patients with lower exposure to obinutuzumab. This finding was consistent with expectations since 
patients with FL made up the majority (almost 90%) of patients in the iNHL population in the GAO4753g 
study  which  were  included  in  the  exposure-PFS  analysis.  It  is  important  to  note  that  those  Exposure-
Efficacy  graphical  analyses  were  not  adjusted  for  prognostic  factors  at  baseline  other  than  baseline 
tumour  size.  Therefore,  the  apparent  association  between  higher  exposure  to  obinutuzumab  and  better 
PFS could be due to confounding factors, such as differences in tumour burden, body weight, and other 
baseline  demographic  and  prognostic  factors.  Further  analyses  of  PFS/OS  and  exposure  in  patients  with 
FL  (i.e.,  Cox  regression  analyses)  conducted  and  are  consistent  with  the  ones  obtained  in  the  iNHL 
population.  No  clear  relationship  between  exposure  level  and  the  occurrence  of  any  SAE  has  been 
evidenced. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Obinutuzumab pharmacokinetics in FL patients could be considered elucidated and in line with the 
knowledge of obinutuzumab PK in CLL. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
No dose response study was submitted. The obinutuzumab dose selection was based on safety, efficacy 
and PK data in phase I studies (BO20999/BO21003), which indicated that an obinutuzumab dose of 1000 
mg was the dose most likely to be well tolerated and efficacious in a majority of NHL patients regardless 
of their initial tumour burden. PK modelling also suggested that additional doses of obinutuzumab on day 
8  and  15  of  cycle  1  and  then  every  2  months  beyond  6  months  were  needed  in  patients  with  iNHL  to 
saturate target-mediated clearance thought to be indicative of clearance of CD19+ cells, and achieve and 
maintain a steady state of drug levels early, and throughout treatment (Gibarsky et al. 2014).  
The  preliminary  data  from  phase  I/II  monotherapy  studies  showed  a  favourable  safe  profile  of 
obinutuzumab treatment beyond 6 months to improve the clinical outcomes of patients otherwise treated 
with bendamustine alone. The dose of bendamustine was given according to the recommendations of the 
consensus  conference  for  relapsed/refractory  iNHL  patients  for  bendamustine  monotherapy  and  in 
combination with rituximab (Cheson et al. 2010).

2.4.2.  Main study 
GAO4753g 
Study GAO4753g is an ongoing, open-label, multicentre, randomized Phase III study to investigate the 
efficacy and safety of bendamustine (benda) compared with bendamustine plus obinutuzumab (G-benda) 
in patients with rituximab-refractory, iNHL those patients who had no response to or who progressed 
within 6 months of treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen.

For each patient, a prior lymph node biopsy demonstrating CD20 positivity of tumour cells had to 
be available locally at the investigator site prior to dosing; this was to be further confirmed 
retrospectively following central pathology review. 
•  A bone marrow biopsy was insufficient for confirming pathology or CD20 positivity. 
•  A lymph-node biopsy to rule out transformation was required in patients for whom there was 
clinical suspicion of transformation. 
•  Refractory to a regimen containing rituximab, defined as no response to or progression within 6 
months of completion of the last dose of rituximab therapy (either as monotherapy or in

treatment (after having received at least one full dose [375 mg/m2] of rituximab) 
Patients with no clinical response (PR or better) to a rituximab-containing regimen consisting of at 
least four weekly doses of rituximab monotherapy or at least four cycles of rituximab + 
chemotherapy

bendamustine alone (benda arm) or obinutuzumab in combination with bendamustine (G-benda arm). 
Figure 1. Overview of study design 
Objectives 
The primary objective of this study was to evaluate clinical benefit in terms of PFS, as assessed by an 
Independent Radiology Facility (IRF), for obinutuzumab when used in combination with bendamustine 
compared with bendamustine alone in patients with indolent NHL refractory to prior rituximab-containing 
therapy. 
The secondary objectives were: 
- To compare PFS as assessed by the investigator 
- To compare OS between study arms 
- To evaluate in each study arm and compare between study arms the following: 
1. ORR (rate of CR + PR) and CR rate at the study treatment completion/early study treatment 
termination visit; 
2. Best ORR achieved during treatment or within 12 months of the start of treatment; 
3. DFS in CR patients; 
4. Duration of response (DoR) in patients with CR and PR 
- To compare EFS between the two study arms 
- To evaluate and compare the safety profiles of patients treated with the combination of bendamustine + 
obinutuzumab and bendamustine alone 
- To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of obinutuzumab in combination with bendamustine and 
evaluate for drug-drug interactions by comparing the pharmacokinetics of the combination with the PK of 
bendamustine alone. 
- To analyze pharmacoeconomics (medical resource utilization) in both arms of the study 
- To assess patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in both treatment arms 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was IRC-assessed PFS, defined as the time from randomization to the first 
occurrence of progression or relapse as assessed by an IRC according to the modified response criteria 
for NHL (Cheson et al, 2007), or to death from any cause. 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/345935/2016 
Page 28/82 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
- PFS as assessed by investigator 
- Best overall response (BOR) and best response of CR during treatment and up to 12 months after the 
start of treatment, as assessed by the IRC and by the investigator 
- Complete response (CR) and overall response (CR or PR) rate at the end-of-induction (EOI)/early study 
treatment termination visit, as assessed by the IRC and by the investigator 
- OS, defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of death from any cause. 
Patients who were not reported as having died at the time of the analysis were censored at the date when 
they were last known to be alive, as documented by the investigator. 
- Disease-free survival (DFS), defined for patients with a best overall response of CR, as the time from 
the first occurrence of a documented CR, as assessed by the IRC, until relapse defined on the basis of the 
IRC assessments or death from any cause on study. 
- Duration of response (DoR), defined as the time from a best overall response of CR or PR to the first 
occurrence of progression/relapse (based on the IRC assessment) or death from any cause on study. 
- Event-free survival (EFS), defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of 
disease progression/relapse based on IRC assessments, death from any cause on study, or start of a new 
anti-lymphoma therapy (NALT). 
- Medical resource utilization, which included the number of hospitalizations related to AEs (as captured in 
the electronic Case Report Form [eCRF] SAE section), types of subsequent drug therapies, and medical 
and surgical procedures (i.e., blood transfusions, bone marrow transplantation, or stem-cell 
transplantation). Analysis of data on medical resource utilization will be summarized in a separate report. 
- Change in health-related patient-reported outcomes (PROs) from baseline, by visit, as assessed by the 
Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Patients with Lymphoma (FACT-Lym) instrument. 
- EuroQol-5 Dimension (EQ-5D) Health Index Scale summary scores at baseline, during treatment, and 
following treatment discontinuation or completion (both progression-free and after disease progression) 
Sample size 
Estimates  of  the  number of  events  required  to  demonstrate  efficacy  with  regard  to  PFS  are  based  upon 
the  hypothesis  with  use  of  a  two-sided  stratified  log-rank  test  at  an  overall  5%  significance  level.  Two-
sided level 0.05 log-rank test, 80% power to detect a hazard ratio (HR) of G-benda versus benda alone of 
0.70 corresponding to a 43% improvement in median PFS from 9.3 to 13.3 months. 
Two interim analyses of PFS were performed, one for futility when approximately 34% of PFS events had 
occurred  and  another  for  efficacy  and  futility  when  approximately  65%  of  the  total  PFS  events  had 
occurred (interim boundary is described in the study protocol). The futility boundary was non-binding with 
respect  to  the  overall  type  I  error  and  no  adjustment  was  made  for  the  early  20-patient,  safety-only 
interim analysis.  
Efficacy boundaries for PFS were computed with the use of the Lan-DeMets approximation to the O’Brien-
Fleming  boundary  shape.  The  futility  boundary  was  chosen  so  that  a  95%  confidence  interval  (CI) 
excluded  the  alternative  hazard  ratio  of  0.7  when  the  observed  monitoring  statistic  matched  the  futility 
boundary exactly.  
Thereby a total of 260 PFS events, as assessed by the IRC were required for the final analysis of the trial.  
With an initial accrual rate of 8.5 patients per month, and a 9-month ramp-up, then reducing to a revised 
assumed accrual rate after 44 months of 5 patients per month and 5% loss to follow-up per year, 410 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/345935/2016

patients enrolled over 54 months and followed for an additional 23 months were required to observe 260 
IRC-assessed PFS events, with a total duration of approximately 77 months. For OS, under the 
assumption of a hazard ratio of 0.73, a total of approximately 96 months (i.e., 3.5 years after the last 
patient enrollment) were required to observe 226 deaths for 55%-65% power. 
Randomisation 
Eligible subjects were randomly assigned to the benda alone or G-benda arm at a ratio of 1:1 using the 
dynamic allocation method, based on the following stratification factors: 
1. Indolent NHL subtype (follicular versus other) 
2. Refractory type (rituximab monotherapy vs. rituximab + chemotherapy) 
3. Number of prior therapies (≤2 vs. >2) 
4. Geographic region. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
The IDMC was responsible for reviewing the data at pre-specified timepoints per the statistical plan, while 
the Sponsor remained blinded to treatment arm allocation of the study data.  
Statistical methods 
PFS  for  patients  without  disease  progression  or  death  was  censored  at  the  time  of  the  last  IRC  tumour 
assessment. If no IRC tumour assessments were performed after the baseline visit, PFS was censored at 
the time of randomization plus 1 day. 
A two-sided stratified Log-Rank test at an overall 5% significance level was done to confirm the primary 
analysis.  Estimates  of  the  treatment  effect  are  expressed  as  hazard  ratios,  estimated  with  the  use  of  a 
stratified  Cox  model,  including  95%  confidence  limits.  Median  PFS  and  the  95%  confidence  limits  were 
estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology using Greenwood’s formula. An unstratified log-rank test was 
also performed as a sensitivity analysis. 
Response  rates  were  compared  using  a  chi-square  test.  In  addition,  95%  confidence  limits  for  the 
difference were calculated using Cochran-Mantel Haenszel. 
To control the overall type 1 error rate at two-sided 5%, the fixed sequence testing procedure (Westfall 
and  Krishen,  2001)  was  used  to  adjust  for  multiple  statistical  testing  of  the  primary  and  key  secondary 
efficacy endpoints. If the primary endpoint was positive, the key secondary endpoints were to be tested 
in the following order: 
- 
- 
- 
PFS as assessed by the investigator 
BOR within 12 months of start of treatment as assessed by the IRC 
Best response of CR within 12 months of start of treatment as assessed by the IRC 
-  OS 
Disease  response  measures  (BOR,  CR  and  overall  response  rates)  were  compared  between  the  two 
treatment arms using stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel tests.  
Patients  with  no  response  assessments  (for  whatever  reason)  were  considered  non-responders.  A  non-
stratified  analysis  calculating  a  X2  test  result  is  provided  as  a  sensitivity  analysis.  In  addition,  response

rates  and  95%  confidence  limits  are given  for  each treatment  group,  and  95%  confidence  limits  for  the 
difference are calculated.  
Analysis  methods  for  OS  and  other  time-to-event  analyses  were  the  same  as  those  described  for  the 
primary  efficacy.  At  the  time  of  the  primary  analysis,  an  interim  OS  analysis  was  performed.  Group 
sequential methods with the use of alpha-spending function with an O’Brien-Fleming boundary were used 
to  control  the  type  I  error  at  the  0.05  level.  A  final  OS  analysis  will  take  place  after  approximately  226 
deaths have occurred.

data cut-off was 1 September 2014. The applicant submitted updated results with a cut-off date of 1 May 
2015.  
Conduct of the study 
Main protocol amendments were: 
In version 2 the bendamustine control arm regimen was modified from 90 mg/m2 to 120 mg/m2 - given 
on days 1 and 2 of a 28 day cycle; rituximab refractoriness was more clearly defined in the inclusion 
criteria. In version 3 exclusion criteria were modified to also exclude patients who had received 
bendamustine; rituximab – refractory iNHL was clarified to mean any prior line and not just the most 
recent; an early interim analysis for futility was added; the analysis of the FACT-Lym questionnaire was 
modified to capture changes in HRQoL based on minimally important differences. In Version 4 a number 
of changes were made to the eligibility criteria, clarifying parameters. In version 5 eligibility criteria were 
modified to allow the enrolment of patients previously treated with a bendamustine - containing regimen 
to reflect clinical practice. A country- specific amendment was made in version 6 to exclude patients with 
a history of PML; revised information about PML was included in version 7. In version 8 the protocol was 
amended to allow for an increase in the number of patients enrolled from 360 to 410 and to extend AE 
reporting period in the comparator arm; revised response criteria for malignant lymphoma were amended 
in appendix E.

Patient reported quality of Life 
Patient-reported  health-related  quality  of  life  (HRQoL)  and  health  status,  as  captured  by  the  FACT-Lym 
and  EQ-5D  health  index  questionnaires,  respectively,  showed  no  overall  difference  between  the  benda 
and G-benda arms over time for the entire iNHL population during the treatment and follow-up periods. 
Time to deterioration of FACT-Lym TOI score, defined as ≥ 6-point worsening from baseline, was delayed 
in  the  G-benda  arm  (median:  8.0  months)  compared  with  the  benda  arm  (median:  4.6  months  (HR  = 
0.74; 95% CI: 0.56, 0.98). 
In  addition,  median  time  to  worsening  of  patient-reported  health-related  quality  of  life  (HRQoL)  (  >  6 
points on the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Lymphoma Trial Outcome Index (FACT-Lym TOI) 
was numerically longer in the G-benda arm than in the benda arm (8.0 vs. 4.6 months) in the iNHL (ITT) 
population.  In  addition,  higher  proportions  of  patients  in  the  G-benda  arm  had  an  improvement  in  their 
FACT-Lym questionnaire scores during treatment and throughout follow-up. 
Efficacy in the non-FL population 
The results of Independent Review committee (IRC)- assessed progression-free survival (PFS) in the non-
FL  population  showed  a  limited  treatment  effect  of  G-benda  compared  to  benda  (hazard  ratio  [HR]  = 
0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46-1.90).

Study BO21000  
Study  BO21000  (GAUDI)  is  an  open-label  Phase  Ib  study  of  obinutuzumab  in  combination  with 
cyclophosphamide,  doxorubicin,  vincristine  and  prednisolone 
(CHOP),  or 
fludarabine  and 
cyclophosphamide  (FC)  as  treatment  for  patients  with  CD20+  B-cell  relapsed  or  refractory  follicular 
lymphoma  (FL)  and  the  combination  of  obinutuzumab  with  CHOP  or  bendamustine  in  patients  with 
previously untreated FL.

• 
In Previously untreated FL patients 
The population in the BO21000 study is different from the target population in the proposed indication for 
the  registration.  Indeed,  part  1  of  the  study  investigated  obinutuzumab  in  combination  with 
chemotherapies different from G-benda and part 2 of the study included previously untreated FL patients; 
not  in  line  with  the  applied  indication.  In  addition,  Study  BO21000  also  used  different  doses  of 
obinutuzumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  (400mg,  800mg  and  1600mg)  whereas  1000  mg  was 
used  in  GAO4753g.  Study  BO21000  used  a  different  maintenance  regimen  of  obinutuzumab  (1000  mg 
every 3 months for 2 years compared with 1000 mg every 2 months for 2 years in Study GAO4753g). 
In the supporting study BO21000, patients were only eligible for the maintenance phase (part 2) if they 
had achieved a complete response (CR), unconfirmed complete response (CRu), or partial response (PR) 
during induction therapy. In the pivotal Study GAO4753g, patients without disease progression at the end 
of  induction  (i.e.,  patients  with  a  CR,  PR  or  stable  disease  [SD])  were  eligible  for  maintenance 
obinutuzumab. 
Study BO21003 
Study  BO21003  (GAUSS)  is  an  open-label  dose-escalating  Phase  I/randomized  Phase  II  study  of 
obinutuzumab as monotherapy in patients with relapsed or refractory CD20+ malignant disease.  
For the Phase I dose-escalation part of the study, all patients with CD20+ malignant disease (NHL or CLL) 
were  eligible  if  no  therapy  of  higher  priority  was  available  and  treatment  with  an  anti-CD20+  antibody 
was deemed appropriate.

- 
in Phase II 
The Phase II part of the study was restricted to patients with relapsed CD20+ iNHL and was designed to 
explore  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  obinutuzumab  versus  rituximab  given  as  monotherapy,  including 
maintenance treatment in patients with CD20+ iNHL. 
The population in the BO21003 study is different from the target population in the proposed indication for 
the  registration  (patients  NHL  or  CCL  versus  FL).  However,  in  part  2  of  the  study  BO21003,  the  study 
population was iNHL patients and the primary endpoint was based on patients with FL only. However, the 
compared study treatments were different from the GAO4753g study (obinutuzumab vs. rituximab given 
as  monotherapy  in  the  BO21003  study);  study  doses  ranging  from  100  mg  –  2000  mg  were  given 
whereas the GAO4753g study used 1000 mg for all doses; The dosing schedule was weekly dosing during 
induction compared with the GAO4753g study (28-day cycles during induction). In the supporting study 
BO21003,  patients  were  only  eligible  for  the  maintenance  phase  if  they  had  achieved  a  complete 
response (CR), unconfirmed complete response (CRu), or partial response (PR) during induction therapy; 
Phase  I  patients  with  SD  were  also  eligible  for  maintenance  if  they  were  considered  to  have  derived 
clinical  benefit  from  induction.  In  the  pivotal  Study  GAO4753g,  patients  without  disease  progression  at 
the  end  of  induction  (i.e.,  patients  with  a  CR,  PR  or  stable  disease  [SD])  were  eligible  for  maintenance 
obinutuzumab. 
Study 20999 
Study  BO20999  (GAUGUIN)  is  an  open-label  dose-escalating  Phase  I/randomized  Phase  II  study  of 
obinutuzumab  as  monotherapy  in  patients  with  relapsed  or  refractory  CD20-positive  (CD20+) 
malignancies.

 Phase I of the study is described in the table below: 
The Phase II part of the study was designed to explore the efficacy and safety of the recommended doses 
identified in Phase I part of the study, in patients with CD20+ relapsed/refractory iNHL, aNHL and CLL, in 
order  to  obtain  further  safety  information  at  these  doses  and  early  efficacy  data  in  the  three  patient 
populations. 
In this part of the study, patients with NHL were randomized to receive either high dose (1600 mg [Cycle 
1, Day 1 and Day 8]/800 mg [all other doses]) or low dose (400 mg) obinutuzumab. 
a Four randomized patients did not receive any study medication (bendamustine); three patients withdrew consent and one patient was 
withdrawn due to physician’s decision. 
b Rituximab data not included. For Study BO21003, only data for patients with FL in the obinutuzumab arm are included. 
** The primary endpoint of this part of the study was safety. 
aNHL = aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma; benda = bendamustine; CLL = chronic lymphocytic lymphoma; CR = complete response; 
CRu = unconfirmed complete response; CSR = clinical study report; FL = follicular lymphoma; G = obinutuzumab;

The population in the BO20999 study is different from the target population in the proposed indication for 
the registration (patients CCL/NHL). The study BO20999 investigated different doses of obinutuzumab as 
monotherapy  (50  mg-2000  mg),  whereas  Study  GAO4753g  only  investigated  obinutuzumab  1000  mg. 
The dosing schedule was also different in the BO20999 study (21-day cycles during induction) compared 
with the GAO4753g study (28-day cycles during induction). 
All  the  supportive  studies  included  adult  (male  or  female)  patients  with  CD20+  disease  based  on  local 
testing followed by central confirmation.  
Patients  in  the  supporting  studies  were  assessed  for  disease  response  by  the  investigator  using  regular 
clinical and laboratory examinations, and CT scans, according to standard response criteria (Cheson et al. 
1999  and  2007).  In  the  Phase  II  part  of  Study  BO21003,  responses  at  the  end  of  induction  were  also 
assessed by an IRC, and the primary endpoint was based on patients with FL only.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The indication is based on the results of pivotal study GAO4753g investigating the efficacy and safety of 
obinutuzumab  plus  bendamustine  (G-benda)  compared  with  bendamustine  (benda)  in  patients  with 
rituximab-refractory, iNHL those patients who had no response to or who progressed within 6 months of 
treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
GAO4753g  was  an  open-label,  randomized  phase  III  study  submitted  to  support  the  application  for  an 
extension of the indication of adding obinutuzumab to bendamustine in patients with iNHL after failure of 
rituximab-based therapy. The study evaluated the efficacy and safety of up to 2.5 years of obinutuzumab 
initially in combination with 6 cycles of bendamustine, compared with bendamustine alone (6 cycles). The 
rationale  of  continued  obinutuzumab  in  the  maintenance  phase  was  based  on  results  with  rituximab 
maintenance up to 2 years after induction therapy, which had shown to improve the outcomes of patients 
with follicular lymphoma in both first line and relapsed/refractory setting (van Oers et al. 2010, Salles et 
al. 2011, Vidal et al. 2011). Based on clinical and non-clinical data, Obinutuzumab was expected to have 
superior efficacy with similar safety to rituximab.  
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive bendamustine 90 mg/m2 day 1 and 2 in cycles 1-6 and 
obinutuzumab 1000 mg day 1, 8 and 15 in cycle 1, day 1 in cycles 2-6 and as maintenance q2 monthly 
for  up  to  2  years  or  bendamustine  as  single  agent  120  mg/m2  day  1  and  2  in  cycles  1-6.  Dynamic 
allocation was used for randomisation which could affect the interpretation of the robustness of presented 
efficacy data.  However, the use of this method has been adequately justified by the applicant. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of the study was PFS, which is considered acceptable in this phase III trial. 
Secondary  endpoints  were:  OS,  tumour  response  (response  rate  and  duration  of  response,  disease  free 
survival (DFS)) and HRQoL based on assessment of various subscales according to functional assessment 
of cancer therapy for patients with lymphoma. Median PFS expected in the protocol were 9.3 months and 
13.3 months respectively in the control and Gazyvaro group. The study was open-label, allowing potential 
subjective bias to be introduced. However, all the evaluations of endpoints were performed by a blinded 
independent review committee. The assessment by the investigators was considered supportive. 
Different subgroups were analysed: histology including grade, gender, age, prognostic index and clinical 
stage,  response  to  prior  therapy,  genotype.  Except  from  the  follicular  lymphomas,  the  majority  of 
subgroups were too small to draw any significant conclusion. 
A total of 413 patients were included. In general the demographics and baseline data were well balanced 
between  the  two  treatment  arms  both  in  the  iNHL  population  and  the  FL  subpopulation.  Overall  the 
majority  of  patients  were  male,  Caucasian  and  less  than  70  years  of  age,  median  age  was  63.0  years 
(range  21  to  87  years).  The  disease  and  disease  prognostic  factors  characteristics  were  also  quite 
comparable  in  the  two  treatment  arms,  with  the  exception  of  a  higher  proportion  of  patients  in  the  G-
benda  arm  than  in  the  benda  arm  with  extranodal  involvement  (55.4%  vs.  49.5%),  indicating  more 
advanced disease. Almost all patients were refractory to rituximab as required by the entry criteria of the 
protocol, 81. 3% in the benda arm and 77.5% in the G-benda arm were considered “double refractory”, 
i.e. also refractory to an alkylating agent. 
The  applicant  has  submitted  information  regarding  3  additional  studies,  one  phase  IB  study  (Bo21000) 
and two phase I/II studies (BO20999 and BO21003).There were major limitations for all 3 studies, they 
were small, and obinutuzumab was given as monotherapy or together with CHOP, FC. In one small study 
obinutuzumab was given together with bendamustine; however this was in patients on first-line therapy 
for follicular lymphoma. Thus, no clinical support from these applications was noted.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The included patients appear to represent the target population. 
The pivotal study GA04753g met its primary endpoint after 67% of events required for the final analysis 
had been observed: treatment with G-benda resulted in a statistically significant reduction by 47% in the 
risk of IRC-assessed PFS compared with benda alone (HR=0.53 (95% CI: 0.40, 0.70; log-rank p-value = 
0.0001). The Kaplan-Meier estimated median PFS (IRC) was 14.1 months   (95% CI: 11.7, 16.6) in the 
benda arm, compared to 29.2months (95% CI: 20.5, NE) (HR 0.52 (0.40, 0.70), p< 0.0001) an increase 
of 15 months, and these results were - consistent with the primary analysis. The median OS could not be 
estimated in either treatment arms in the primary or updated analysis. 
The  best  overall  response  rates  (CR/PR)  and  CR  rates,  as  assessed  by  the  IRC  were  not  statistically 
different  between  treatment  arms.  Investigator-assessed  results  were  in  agreement.    An  exploratory 
analysis  of  MRD  in  blood at  the end  of induction in the  FL  patients  was  performed.  In  the  G-benda  arm 
82.4% were MRD negative vs. 42.9% in the benda arm (p<0.0001, Chi-squared). These results however 
should be interpreted with caution due to a small population evaluated.     
The duration of response (DoR) and DFS were longer in the G-benda arm (median not reached) compared 
with  the  benda  arm  (median  11.9  months  for  DoR  and  13.0  months  for  DFS).  Hazard  ratios  were  0.36 
(95%  CI:  0.24,  0.54)  for  DoR  and  0.10  (95%  CI:  0.02,  0.44)  for  DFS.  EFS  was  longer  in  the  G-benda 
arm  compared  with  the  benda  arm  (median:  28.3  months  vs.  11.8  months)  (HR:  0.52;  95%  CI:0.38, 
0.71,  p-value  <  0.0001,  stratified  log-rank  test).  Overall,  the  results  of  the  IRC-assessed  PFS  subgroup 
analyses  in  FL  patients  were  consistent  with  the  results  in  the  overall  ITT  (iNHL)  population.  A  trend 
towards a smaller benefit was observed for patients with >2 prior therapies (n= 66; HR= 0.82, 95% CI: 
0.39,1.72) with the upper 95% CI limit crossing 1. 
In  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  FL,  which  comprised  81.1%  of  the  iNHL  study  population,  the  results 
were  similar.  The  HR  for  IRC-assessed  PFS  was  0.48  (95%  CI:  0.34,  0.68,  p-value  =0.0001,  stratified 
log-rank  test).  PFS  as  assessed  by the  Investigator confirmed  the  IRC-assessed  PFS  results  (HR  =0.48; 
95% CI: 0.35, 0.67, p-value < 0.0001, stratified log-rank test). The median investigator assessed PFS in 
the  G-benda  arm  (29.2  months  [95%  CI:  17.5;  NE])  was  over  twice  as  long  as  that  in  the  benda  arm 
(13.7 months [95% CI: 11.0; 15.5]). 
Regarding  the  geographical  stratification  factor,  there  is  a  heterogeneity  in  the  PFS  responses  for  both 
IRC and investigator assessment levels in the ITT population: HR=0,92 95%CI (0,43 – 2,00) in Eastern 
Europe population (perhaps linked to low number of analyzed patients), HR=0,35 95%CI (0,21 – 0,58) in 
the  North  America  patients  and  HR=0,68  95%CI  (0,44  –  1,05)  in  the  Western  Europe  patients.  These 
results were confirmed in FL patients.  
The updated OS data show that the median OS has not been reached yet, but fewer patients with FL had 
died in the G-benda arm (30/164 [18.3%]) compared to the benda arm (48/171 [28.1%]).  
Patient  reported  outcomes  (FACT-Lym  questionnaire  and  EQ-5D  index  scale)  during  the  treatment  and 
follow-up  periods,  showed  that  health-related  quality  of  life  was  generally  maintained.  The  addition  of 
obinutuzumab to bendamustine delayed the time to worsening of quality of life as measured by the FACT-
Lym  TOI  score  (HR:  0.74;  95%  CI:  0.56,  0.98).  However,  these  results  could  have  been  biased  by  the 
open-label design of the study.  
The majority of patients completed treatment as planned. The proportion of patients who received 90% of 
their planned obinutuzumab doses during induction was high (90.2%).  
In  the  Maintenance  Phase,  almost  all  patients  (97.2%)  received  >90%  of  planned  obinutuzumab  during 
their time on treatment. The proportion of patients who withdrew from all study medication due to an AE 
was higher in the benda arm (15.7% of patients) than in the G-benda arm (11.3% of patients). 
Since  non-FL  iNHLs  express  CD20  and  are  known  to  respond  to  rituximab  (Kiesewetter  et  al.  2015; 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/345935/2016 
Page 59/82 
 
  
  
 
Bennett  and  Schechter  2010),  it  is  biologically  plausible  that  obinutuzumab  will  have  efficacy  in  non-FL 
iNHL,  as  well  as  FL.  The  Study  BO21004/CLL-11  established  the  superiority  of  obinutuzumab  + 
chlorambucil (G-Clb) versus rituximab + chlorambucil (R-Clb) in patients with CLL (Report No. 1056550). 
Because  CLL  and  SLL  are  considered  different  manifestations  of  the  same  disease  entity  (Sun  and 
Weistner 2015), the efficacy of obinutuzumab-based therapy has effectively already been shown for one 
subtype  of  non-FL.  The  results  of  Independent  Review  committee  (IRC)-  assessed  progression-free 
survival (PFS) in the non-FL population showed a limited treatment effect of G-benda compared to benda 
(hazard ratio [HR] = 0.94; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.46-1.90). This result need to be interpreted in 
light of the small patient numbers with non-FL and the small number of patients who had had an event at 
the time of data cutoff for the primary analysis.  
In  the  light  of  the  above  results  the  indication  for  obinutuzumab  is  focusing  on  patients  with  FL.  A 
statement  has  been  included  in  Section  5.1  of  the  SmPC  “In  the  non-FL  population  the  HR  for  IRC-
assessed PFS was 0.94 [95% CI: 0.49, 1.90]. No definitive conclusions could be drawn on efficacy in the 
MZL  and  SLL  sub-populations.”  A  randomized  Phase  III  trial  -  BO21223  (GALLIUM)  (in  which 
chemotherapy-naïve  patients  are  randomized  to  G-chemo  followed  by  G  maintenance  vs.  R-chemo 
followed  by  R  maintenance)  includes  approximately  200  patients  with  advanced  MZL  and  is  currently 
ongoing. 
Data from the supportive studies presented were not pooled because of differences in treatment regimens 
used  and  patient  population  enrolled  and  for  these  reasons  they  would  mainly  be  considered  as 
supportive  of  the  efficacy  for  the  present  application.  Indeed,  the  population  treated  by  G-benda  in  the 
study B021000 is a first-line treated population, not in line with the applied indication.  
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy  
The efficacy results showed a clinically significant and statistically robust improvement in PFS supporting 
the  indication  of  obinutuzumab  in  combination  with  bendamustine  followed  by  maintenance  for  the 
treatment of patients with follicular lymphoma who did not respond to or who progressed during or up to 
6  months  after  treatment  with  rituximab  or  a  rituximab-containing  regimen.  OS  data  were  currently 
immature; . Final OS analysis is expected at study Completion (See RMP). 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Safety data for obinutuzumab in patients with iNHL are primarily derived from the pivotal phase III study 
GA04753g. The applicant also reports safety data from supporting studies: BO21000: Phase 1 study with 
137  FL  patients,  BO21003-Phase  I/II  study  186  patients  (100  patients  with  iNHL  [Phase  I  and  II]  were 
exposed  to  obinutuzumab,  86  patients  with  iNHL  [Phase  II]  were  exposed  to  rituximab  [Rituxan, 
MabThera]) and BO20999 Phase I/II study with 56 patients. Safety data from the pivotal and supporting 
studies were not pooled, because of key differences in the study design, patient population and treatment 
regimens.  
Patient exposure in pivotal study GAO4753g 
Clinical safety data are available for a total of 409 patients. At the time of the clinical cutoff date 154 of 
204 (75.5%) patients enrolled in the G-benda arm started the Maintenance Phase and 29 patients were 
still  receiving  maintenance  treatment;  therefore,  the  Follow-Up  period  after  the  completion  of 
maintenance was relatively short and there is limited long-term Follow-Up data available.

The  safety  population  was  defined  as  all  subjects  who  received  any  amount  of  obinutuzumab  or 
bendamustine  therapy.  In  the  induction  phase,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  received  all  planned 
infusions  of  bendamustine  was  71.7%  in  the  benda  arm  and  78.3%  in  the  G-benda  arm  (median  12 
doses over 170 days in both arms).  
The  majority  of  patients  received  >90%  of  the  planned  dose  of  study  medication  for  their  time  on 
treatment.  Given  the  differing  planned  doses  of  bendamustine  between  treatment  arms,  the  median 
cumulative dose of bendamustine during induction was higher in the benda arm (2347 mg) than in the G-
benda arm (1920 mg). The most common reason for dose modification of benda was AE. 
In the G-benda arm 81.9% of patients received all scheduled cycles of their planned obinutuzumab dose. 
A  total  of  22.2%  of  patients  had  an  infusion  modification  of  obinutuzumab  during  the  induction  phase, 
mostly  in  cycle  1  (19.6%  of  patients)  and  due  to  AE.  Almost  all  patients  89.7%received  >  90%  of  the 
planned obinutuzumab dose intensity.

Overall Safety by Treatment Phase (ITT Population)(Cutoff: 1 May 2015) 
Commonly affected SOCs  in which the incidence of  all grade individual AEs was higher (>5%) in the G-
benda  arm  than  in  the  benda  arm,  included:  neutropenia,  fatigue,  pyrexia,  asthenia,  upper  respiratory 
tract infections and coughing, IRR, arthralgia, pruritus and hypotension.  
GI  AEs  were  more  common  in  the  benda  arm  (82.3%  vs.  74.7%)  mainly  due  to:  nausea,  vomiting  and 
diarrhea.  The  incidence  of  thrombocytopenia  was  also  higher  in  the  benda  arm,  probably  due  to  the 
higher dose of bendamustine.  All these adverse events are well known for the two substances and in this 
patient  population.  The  AEs  are  manageable,  and  AE  due  to  IRRs  should  be  managed  by  prophylactic 
treatment in an appropriate clinical setting. 
As for AE incidence by age group, ie. < 65,  65-75 and  75-85 and >85 years, the difference between the 
treatment arms in terms of AE incidence in G-benda arm did not increase with older age. 
The  adverse  events  including  the  serious  AEs  are  well  known  for  the two  substances  and  in  this  patient 
population.  The  most  common  serious  AEs  were  reported  in  the  blood  and  lymphatic  system,  (5.6%  of 
the patients in the benda arm and 10.3% in the G-benda arm)   and infections (15.6% in the benda arm 
and  16.4%  in  the  G-benda  arm).  Number  of  patients  in  the  different  AE  groups  were  small.  The  main 
difference between the two treatment arms was reported in neutropenia which occurred in 3.1% in the G-
benda  arm  compared  with  0.5%  in  the  benda  arm.  However  no  difference  was  reported  in  number  of 
febrile neutropenia or number of “infections and infestations” between the two treatment arms, the AEs 
seems manageable and are therefore not of major concern. 
Other adverse events of special interests (AESI) 
All  grade  events  of  IRRs,  neutropenia,  thrombopenia,  infection,  tumour  lysis  syndrome  (TLS),  GI 
perforation, cardiac events, second malignancy and hepatitis B reactivation were identified as AESI.  
IRR 
IRRs  were  AEs  related  to  any  study  medication,  which  occurred  during  infusion  or  within  24  h  from  the 
end of infusion. The majority of IRRs were grade 1 or 2 and most IRRs resolved after treatment, no fatal 
IRRs  was  noted  in  this  study.  The  incidence  of  IRRs  was  higher  in  the  G-benda  arm  (68.6%)  compared

with the benda arm (63.1%), as was the incidence of Grade 3 and 4 IRRs, serious IRRs, IRRs leading to 
withdrawal  from  treatment  or  dose  reductions/-  interruptions.  36.9%  of  patients  in  the  benda  arm  and 
77.8% in the G-benda arm received prophylactic corticosteroids. In these patients, the incidence of IRR 
was  13.7%  in  the  benda  arm,  and  32.5%  in  the  G-benda  arm.  In  those  who  did  not  receive 
premedication, the incidence of IRRs was 24.0% and 55.8 respectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
IRRs  led  to  interruption  of  bendamustine  in  13/198  (6.6%)  of  patients  in  the  benda  arm  and  11/194 
(5.7%) of patients in the G-benda arm. Few patients required dose reduction (2 patients in each arm) or 
withdrawal (3 patients vs. 1 patient) of bendamustine due to IRR. The incidence of IRRs was higher in the 
first cycle and decreased in the following cycles. 
In  total,  110/194  (56.7%)  patients  had  AEs  related  to  obinutuzumab  infusions.  The  Obinutuzumab 
infusion  was  interrupted  in  45/194  (23.2%)  patients,  most  of  whom  went  on  to  receive  the  full  dose, 
while  only  5  (2.6%)  patients  did  not  receive  the  full  infusion  and  4  (2.1%)  patients  discontinued 
obinutuzumab.  In  the  maintenance  period  IRRs  were  observed  in  8.4%  of  the  patients,  obinutuzumab 
had to be discontinued in 1.4% of the patients.  
Guidance  for  prophylaxis  and  premedication  administration  of  obinutuzumab  for  IRRs  is  noted  in  the 
SmPC, patients should continue to receive repeated prophylaxis prior to each subsequent infusion at the 
physicians  discretion.  Obinutuzumab  should  be  administered  under  appropriate  clinical  setting  as 
mentioned in the SmPC. 
Neutropenia 
The  incidence  of  neutropenia  in  the  study  overall  was  higher  in  the  G-benda  arm,  (31.8%  benda  vs. 
37.6% G-benda), mainly due to more grade 4 events in the G-benda arm. No grade 5 event occurred in 
each  arm.  In  the  induction  phase  the  incidence of neutropenia  AEs  was  similar  in  the  two  arms  (30.8% 
vs.  31.4%)  and  also  generally  constant  over  time.  In  the  maintenance  period  with  obinutuzumab,  the 
incidence  of  neutropenia  was  11.9%.  all  the  neutropenia  AEs  resolved  and  no  fatal  neutropenia  events 
were reported.  
The use of myeloid growth factors was permitted for the primary prevention of febrile neutropenia or as 
prophylactic support for patients who experienced Grade ≥ 3 myelosuppression with febrile neutropenia, 
at the investigator’s discretion. 
Granulocyte-colony  stimulating  factor  (G-CSF)  administration  was  prespecified  in  cases  of  Grade  3  or  4 
neutropenia  requiring  dose  delay  or  modification  of  bendamustine  and/or  obinutuzumab.  There  was  no 
imbalance in the use of G-CSF between the treatment arms as concomitant medication (31.7% in benda 
arm, 36.6% in G-benda arm). 
Prolonged Neutropenia and Late Onset Neutropenia 
Prolonged  neutropenia  was  defined  as  ANC  <  1.0x109  cells/mm3,  that  had  not  resolved  to  within  the 
normal  range  by  the  previous  visit  before  receiving  the  last  dose  of  obinutuzumab.  Late  onset 
neutropenia  was  defined  as  an  initial  ANC  <  1.0x109/  cells/mm3  at  any  time  after  the  last  dose  of 
obinutuzumab.  Prolonged  neutropenia  occurred  in  5  patients  (2.6%)  in  the  G-benda  arm.  One  of  these 
patients had serious instances of prolonged neutropenia. Late onset neutropenia occurred in 14 patients 
(7.2%)  in  the  G-benda  arm  (7  of  these  patients  had  serious  instances  of  late  onset  neutropenia,  one 
patient had a fatal sepsis. 
Infections  
The incidence of infections throughout the whole study was higher in the G-benda arm (65.5%) compared 
with  55.6%  in  the  benda-arm.  Each  arm  had  a  similar  proportion  of  grade  3-5  infections,  serious 
infections and fatal infections (7 patients in the benda arm and 5 patients in the G-benda arm) Infections 
Assessment report

in  both  arms  included  viral  infections  (most  commonly  herpes  virus  relates  infections),  fungal  infections 
and bacterial infections with no imbalance between the treatment arms. 
One  case  of  Hepatitis  B  reactivation  was  reported  as  an  AE  in  the  benda  arm,  this  event  recovered 
after  adequate  treatment.  No  cases  of  progressive  multifocal  encephalopathy  (PML)  in  either  treatment 
arm was reported. 
Thrombocytopenia  
Thrombocytopenia  in  the  study  overall  was  higher  in  the  benda  arm  compared  with  the  G-benda  arm 
(23.7%  vs.  14.9%).  A  higher  incidence  of  thrombocytopenia  during  the  first  cycle  of  therapy  was 
reported  compared  with  the  subsequent  cycles,  but  no  difference  between  the  two  treatments  arms. 
There was no grade 5 event of thrombocytopenia in either arms, but the event was reported serious in 4 
patients  (2.1%)  in  the  G-benda  arm  vs.  none  in  the  benda  arm.  Grade  3/4  thrombocytopenia  was  not 
associated  with  significant  bleeding  events.  In  the  benda  arm  6.1%  patients  and  3.6%  in  the  G-benda 
arm discontinued the treatment due to thrombocytopenia. Most thrombocytopenia events resolved (83% 
patients  with  events  in  each  arm),  and  21.3%  and  34.5%  in  the  benda  and  G-benda  arm  respectively 
received treatment for this AE. One patient in the G-benda arm had acute thrombocytopenia, defined as 
occurring within 24 h after the infusion. This was a grade 3 serious event, obinutuzumab was interrupted, 
and the symptoms resolved without treatment. 
In the maintenance phase two patients (1.4%) in the G-benda arm had grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia after 
the first maintenance cycle, in the subsequent assessments no events were reported. 
The incidence of haemorrhagic events in the study overall was similar in the two treatment arms, 10.1% 
in  the  benda  arm  vs.  10.8%  in  the  G-benda  arm.  Hemorrhagic  events  were  reported  as  serious  in  3 
patients (1.5%) in the benda arm and 6 patients (3.1%) in the G-benda arm. Most events resolved, 85% 
in each arm, and 30.0% of patients in the benda arm and 47.6% patients in the G-benda arm received 
treatment for this AE. No grade 5 event was reported. 
Tumour Lysis Syndrome (TLS) 
TLS  was  reported  in  2  patients  (1.0%)  in  the  benda  arm  and  1  (0.5%)  in  the  G-benda  arm.  All  events 
occurred  during  the  first  cycle  of  induction,  treatment  for  this  AE  was  given  and  2  of  the  patients  could 
continue study treatment as planned. One patient in the benda arm experienced renal failure on day 17, 
progressive  lymphoma  and  died  on  day  29.  This  event  was  considered  to  be  related  to  underlying 
disease, rather than bendamustine. 
Gastrointestinal perforation 
Bowel  perforation  has  been  reported  in  a  few  patients  treated  with  obinutuzumab.  In  this  study  2/194 
patients (1%) from the G-benda arm had a bowel perforation. In one patient the perforation was thought 
to  be  due  to  diverticulitis,  and  the  maintenance  treatment  with  obinutuzumab  was  delayed.  The  other 
patients experienced two abdominal abscesses. Both patients were treated conservatively with antibiotics, 
both recovered and patient number two continued study medication. 
Cardiac events 
The incidence of all grade cardiac AE during the overall study was lower in the benda arm (11) compared 
with the G-benda (22), (5.6% vs. 11.3%). This was due to different cardiac events: cardiac failure (0% 
vs.  2.1%),  tachycardia  (1.0%  vs.  2.1%),  bradycardia  (0%  vs.  1.5%)  and  atrial  fibrillation  (1.0%  vs. 
2.1%)  in  benda  vs.  G-  benda  arm  respectively.  The  difference  was  partly  driven  by  symptoms  of  IRRs. 
The majority of cardiac events were grade 1 or 2. There were three grade 3-5 AE events, (in 3 patients) 
in the benda arm: atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction and paroxysmal arrhythmia, one was considered 
an  IRR.  In  the  G-benda  arm  10  grade  3-5  events  (in  9  patients)  were  observed:  atrial  fibrillation  (2 
patients),  cardiac  failure  (2  patients),  myocardial  infarction  (1  patient),  acute  coronary  syndrome  (1

patient),  atrial  flutter  (1  patient)  coronary  artery  disease  (1  patient)  and  intracardiac  thrombus  (1 
patient), none of these were considered IRRs. None of the cardiac events were fatal. 
Second malignancies 
Second  malignancies  occurring  6  months  after  the  start  of  therapy  or  later  was  similar  in  the  two 
treatment arms (5.1% in the benda arm and 7.2% in the G-benda arm).             
Deaths  
Until the clinical cut-off date, a total of 41/198 patients (20.7%) in the benda  arm and 34/194 patients 
(17.5%) in the G-benda arm had died during the study. PD was the most common cause of death in each 
treatment  arm  (benda  29/198,  14.6%;  G-benda  22/194,  11.3%).  Others  died  because  of  AE:  benda 
12/198 (6.1%) and in G-benda 12/194 (6.2%).  Death due to AE, was mainly caused by infections, other 
malignancies  (leukemia,  colorectal  cancer  and  T-cell  lymphoma),  tumour  lysis  syndrome  and  stroke. 
There was no imbalance in the incidence of fatal events between the two arms.  
Laboratory findings 
The  changes  in  hematology  parameters  observed  in  the  G-benda  arm  were  consistent  with  the 
mechanism  of  action  of  obinutuzumab.  Grade  4  neutropenia  were  more  frequently  reported  in  the  G-
benda arm, 21.2% vs. 32.0%.  
The incidence of AE was higher in patients who had creatinine clearance < 50 ml/min, however number of 
patients  was  small  and  the  results  should  be  interpreted  with  caution.  In  116/121  patients,  B-cell 
depletion  was  only  assessed  in  the  G-benda  arm.  It  was  defined  as  CD19+B-cell  counts  <  0.07x109/L 
after at least one dose of obinutuzumab had been administered. B-cell depletion started on day 8 of Cycle 
1  in  the  majority  of  patients.    At  the  time  of  the  clinical  data  cut-off,  recovery  was  only  noted  in  2 
patients.  
IgG  was  affected  in  14.9%  of  the  patients  and  was  not  recovered  at  the  time  of  data  cut-off.  In  other 
chemistry parameters, no notably differences were evident, except that hypocalcemia was more frequent 
in the G-benda arm (37.6% vs. 25.9%). Urinanalysis showed no clinical important trends. 
Human Anti-Human Antibodies (HAHA) was positive in two patients at baseline and both patients had an 
IRR the same day. One patient had a grade 1 IRR and was able to continue on study treatment, the other 
patient had a grade 4 IRR and obinutuzumab was discontinued.  
With  the  updated  results;  No  major  changes  in  the  laboratory  hematology  or  biochemistry  parameters 
were  observed  in  in  the  updated  laboratory  test  analysis  as  compared  with  the  primary  analysis.  As 
described in the primary CSR, the frequency of Grade 3-4 leucopenia, lymphocytopenia and neutropenia 
was higher in the G-benda arm than in the benda arm. Notably, there was no difference in the incidence 
of Grade 3-5 infections between treatment arms (38 patients [18.5%] in the benda arm and 40 patients 
[19.6%] in the G-benda arm). 
Safety in special populations 
Overall, the updated analysis of safety by patient age group (< 65 and ≥ 65 years) were consistent with 
the  primary  analysis  showing  a  higher  incidence  in  both  treatment  arms  of  clinically  important  AEs, 
including  SAEs,  Grade  5  AEs  and  AEs  leading  to  withdrawal  from  treatment  in  patients  ≥  65  years  old 
than in younger patients. The difference in incidence between arms for SAEs  in patients ≥ 65 years old 
remained  relatively  consistent  (~10%  higher  in  the  G-benda  arm)  at  both  clinical  cutoff  dates  for  the 
primary and updated analyses. 
The  updated  analysis  of  safety  by  renal  function  was  consistent  with  the  primary  analysis.  Only  a  small 
number  of  patients  (33  [~8%])  had  creatinine  clearance  (CrCL)  of  <  50  mL/min  at  baseline,  and 
therefore  the  results  should  be  interpreted  with  caution.  In  both  treatment  arms,  the  incidence  of  SAEs

and deaths was higher in patients with CrCL < 50 L/min at baseline compared with patients with CrCL > 
50 L/min at baseline. 
Overview  of  Safety  in  patients  with  FL  (comparison  with  overall  iNHL  patients  population) 
Cutoff: 1 May 2015) 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted with obinutuzumab as such interactions are 
not  expected  with  this  mAb.  A  comparison  of  serum  pharmacokinetic  parameters  from  studies  of 
obinutuzumab monotherapy (Studies BO20999, BO21003) with pharmacokinetic parameters from studies 
of obinutuzumab in combination with chemotherapy (BO21000) suggests that concomitant chemotherapy 
has minimal impact on the pharmacokinetics of obinutuzumab. 
Discontinuation and dose modifications due to adverse events   
Reasons  for  dose  modifications/discontinuation  were  neutropenia,  thrombocytopenia  and  IRRs.  The 
proportion  of  patients  who  experienced  at  least  one  AE  that  led  to  discontinuation  of  study  medication 
was  15.7%  in  the  benda  arm  vs.  18.0%  in  the  G-benda  arm.  The  most  common  AEs  that  led  to 
discontinuation  (benda  vs.  G-benda)  were:  thrombocytopenia  (6.1%  and  3.6%,  neutropenia  (2.5%  and 
4.6%), infections (3.5% and 2.1%) espec. pneumonia (1.0% in both arms) and IRRs (1.5% and 2.1%) 
Dose  modification,  i.e.  dose  reductions  or  increase  were  not  allowed  for  obinutuzumab,  but  dose 
interruption, delays, discontinuations and reduction of infusion rate were permitted. The incidence of AEs 
that  led  to  any  drug  modification  (all  dose  modifications  and  interruptions)  during  the  entire  study  was 
higher  in  the  G-benda  arm  (61.3%)  vs.  the  benda  arm  (43.9%),  mainly  due  to  IRRs  and  comparable 
symptoms.    Thrombocytopenia  led  to  a  higher  proportion  of  dose  modifications  in  the  benda  arm 
compared  with  the  G-benda  (18.7%  vs.  11.9%).  The  most  common  AEs  that  resulted  in  dose 
modification  of  obinutuzumab  were  neutropenia  (21,6  %)  and  thrombocytopenia  (11.3%).  A  higher 
incidence  of  AEs  leading  to  bendamustine  dose  modification  (41.4%)  in  the  benda  arm  than  in  the  G-
benda arm. This  was mainly due to the following: thrombocytopenia (benda 18.7% vs. G-benda 9.8%), 
GI disorders (5.1% vs. 3.6%), mainly nausea, diarrhea and stomatitis and IRR (3.5% vs. 2.1%). A total 
of 22.2% of patients had an infusion modification of obinutuzumab (i.e., infusion interruptions, slowing or 
discontinuations) during the Induction Phase, most of which occurred during Cycle 1 (19.6% of patients), 
and  ‘AE’  was  the  most  common  reason  (3.1%).  The  most  common  AEs  that  resulted  in  delaying  the 
Assessment report 
EMA/CHMP/345935/2016 
Page 68/82 
 
  
  
 
 
obinutuzumab dose (other than dose interruptions and slowing of the infusion) were neutropenia (21.6%) 
and  thrombocytopenia  (11.3%).  Most  of  these  modifications  did  not  result  in  discontinuation  of  the 
infusion;  the  majority  of  patients  (99.4%  to  100%)  of  patients  received  >90%  of  the  planned 
obinutuzumab  dose  from  Cycle  2  onwards.  The  most  common  AE  that  resulted  in  modifying  the 
obinutuzumab dose was neutropenia. 
Adverse Events During the Maintenance Phase 
Safety data for the maintenance phase are only presented for the G-benda arm. 
The AEs reported during the Maintenance Phase accounted for 21.6% (623/2889) of all events reported 
for the G-benda arm over the entire study. The overall incidence of AEs for patients in the Maintenance 
Phase was 76.2%, the most common AEs was neutropenia and infections (Table 69). Grade 3-5 AEs were 
reported in 29.4% of the patients, the most frequent which occurred in ≥ 5% of patients was neutropenia 
(9.8%).  Other  grade  3-5  AEs  occurred  in  1-2  patients.  SAEs  were  reported  in  18  patients,  most  were 
isolated, with the exception of febrile neutropenia and sepsis.  
Other  AEs  that  occurred  in  ≥  5%  of  patients  were all  Grade  1-2.  No grade  5  AEs  or  deaths  were  noted 
and  the  incidence  of  IRRs  and  neutropenia  was  lower  in  the  Maintenance  Phase  compared  with  the 
Induction Phase. 
The  AEs  that  led  to  withdrawal  of  patients  from  study  medication  during  the  maintenance  period,  were 
pneumonia (2), one had a pseudomonal lung infection, neutropenia (3), AML/MDS (2) and bladder cancer 
(1 patient). 
The  most  common  cause of  study  drug  delay/interruption  was  neutropenia,  which  occurred  in  14.7% of 
the patients.  
Overall  the  incidence  of  AEPI  was  low  during  the  Maintenance  Phase:  IRRs  (12  patients),  neutropenia 
(17),  infections  (67),  thrombocytopenia  (2)  and  cardiac  event  (7  patients).  The  nature,  frequency  and 
severity was consistent with previous experience with obinutuzumab monotherapy.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The collection of safety data was the same in the two treatment arms during the Induction Phase of the 
study,  but  for  patients  in  the  G-benda  arm  safety  data  collection  continued  in  the  Maintenance  Phase. 
Thus,  differences  in  safety  data  between  treatment  arms  should  therefore  be  interpreted  in  the  light  of 
longer treatment period in the G-benda arm, and different safety reporting requirements in each arm.   
Clinical safety data are available for a total of 409 patients.  Due to the higher incidence of neutropenia 
observed in patients given bendamustine in combination with CD20-targeted agents, patients were given 
different doses of bendamustine in the two arms (120 mg/m2/dose in the benda arm vs. 90 mg/m2/dose 
in the G-benda arm. The treatment duration was also different, 6 months in the benda arm (6 cycles of 
induction  therapy)  and  2.5  years  in  the  G-benda  arm  (6  cycles  of  induction  G-benda  followed  by 
obinutuzumab maintenance for up to 2 years. At the time of the clinical cutoff date 154 of 204 (75.5%) 
patients  started  the  Maintenance  Phase  and  29  patients  were  still  receiving  maintenance  treatment; 
therefore,  the  Follow-Up  period  after  the  completion  of  maintenance  was  relatively  short  and  there  is 
limited long-term Follow-Up data available. 
Overall,  the  pivotal  study  demonstrated  that  induction  therapy  with  obinutuzumab  in  combination  with 
bendamustine followed by obinutuzumab maintenance has a manageable safety profile that is comparable 
to that of bendamustine induction therapy alone, apart from a higher incidence of SAEs, Grade 3-5 AEs, 
and  AEs  leading  to  dose  modification/interruption.  These  differences  were  mainly  due  to  IRRs  and 
neutropenia,  although  the  incidence  of  neutropenia  was  comparable  in  the  benda  and  G-benda  arms 
during  the  induction  phase.  Infections  were  more  frequently  reported  in  the  G-benda  arm,  but  the 
difference  was  modest  and  did  not  result  in  a  greater  incidence  of  withdrawals,  incidence  of  Grade  3-5, 
events  or  fatal  infections.  The  difference  might  be  due  to  the  longer  duration  of  treatment  and  longer 
observation  period  in  the  G-benda  arm,  and/or  differences  in  safety  data  collection  between  the  two 
arms.  The  incidence  of  thrombocytopenia  was  higher  in  the  benda  arm  compared  to  the  G-benda  arm, 
probably  due  to  a  higher  dose  of  bendamustine  in  the  benda  arm.  No  difference  was  reported  in  the 
Assessment report

incidence of hemorrhagic events between the two arms, most events were grade 1-2, and the grade 3-4 
events were not associated with thrombocytopenia. 
The  safety  profile  of  the  study  drugs  in  the  overall  iNHL  and  FL  populations  was  similar.  Overall,  the 
safety  profile  of  G-benda  was  similar  to  that  of  bendamustine  alone  and  also  consistent  with  previously 
observed,  including  in  the  pivotal  study  for  obinutuzumab  in  combination  with  chlorambucil  in  patients 
with CLL (Goede V et al. 2015).    
Number  of  AEs  during  the  maintenance  with  obinutuzumab  was  lower  than  during  induction.  Most  AEs 
were  grade  1-2,  and  the  character  was  well  known  and  manageable:  IRRs  neutropenia  and  infections. 
The  majority  of  IRRs  were  grade  1-2,  no  grade  5  IRRs  were  reported  in  the  study.  The  IRRs  led  to 
withdrawal  of  obinutuzumab  in  only  4  patients  (3%),  and  to  withdrawal  of  bendamustine  in  3  patients 
(2.4%) in the benda arm and 1 patient (0.8%) in the G-benda arm. These data suggests that treatment 
recommendations  for  prophylaxis  and  management  of  IRRs  (incl.  premedication  with  corticosteroids, 
adjustment  to the  infusion  rate  and other  supportive  treatment)  were effective  in  preventing/controlling 
severe  IRRs.  The  nature,  frequency  and  severity  of  AEs  was  consistent  with  previous  experience  with 
obinutuzumab monotherapy. 
Reasons  for  dose  modifications/discontinuation  were  well  known  and  manageable:  neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia and IRRs. The treatment arms were balanced with respect to the proportion of patients 
who experienced at least one AE that led to discontinuation of study medication, 15.7% in the benda arm 
vs.  18.0%  in  the  G-benda  arm.  The  most  common AEs  that  led  to  discontinuation  (benda  vs.  G-benda) 
were:  thrombocytopenia  (6.1%  and  3.6%,  neutropenia  (2.5%  and  4.6%),  infections  (3.5%  and  2.1%) 
especially pneumonia (1.0% in both arms) and IRRs (1.5% and 2.1%) 
The  supportive  studies  provided  additional  evidence  of  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  obinutuzumab 
maintenance  treatment.  In  supporting  studies  BO21000  and  BO21003,  223  patients  received 
obinutuzumab  maintenance  treatment  for  more  than  1  year,  and  80 patients  were  treated  for the  full 2 
year period as planned.  
Other  AEs  of  special  interests  were  cardiac  events,  the  incidence  being  higher  in  the  G-benda  arm,  but 
with no particular pattern emerging. One third of the events were considered IRRs, and the majority were 
grade 1 or 2 and manageable. When viewed in isolation, the two cases of gastrointestinal (GI) perforation 
reported  in  the  G-benda  arm  versus  no  cases  in  the  benda  arm  of  Study  GAO4753g  do  not  provide 
convincing evidence of a causal role for obinutuzumab in GI perforation due to other confounding factors. 
However,  when  viewed  in  the  context  of  the  known  risk  of  GI  perforation  in  NHL  patients  treated  with 
rituximab, three cases of GI perforation in the supporting studies, and the two cases that occurred in the 
pivotal study, the data become more compelling. Accordingly, GI perforation, is considered an important 
identified risk for obinutuzumab.  
A  rather  high  incidence  of  IRRs  is  noted.  Patients  should  receive  prophylactic  pre-treatment  before  the 
first  dose  of  study  drug  the  treatment  should  be  administered  under  suitable  clinical  settings  and 
surveillance, as mentioned in the SmPC 
The  safety  profile  of  obinutuzumab  in  this  study  was  as  expected,  as  it  is  an  anti-CD20  antibody,  with 
infusion-related reactions (IRRs), neutropenia and infections being the most common adverse events. The 
safety  profile  of  G-benda  was  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profiles  of  the  individual  study  drugs, 
including  that  seen  in  the  pivotal  CLL-11  study  with  obinutuzumab  in  combination  with  chlorambucil  in 
patients with CLL (Goede V et al. 2015). The difference between the two treatment arms was mainly due 
to IRRs and neutropenia and manageable with the recommendations outlined in the protocol and SmPC. 
The similarity in safety profile between the two treatment arms is supported by the PRO data, which also 
was similar in the two treatment arms, indicating no detrimental effect on quality of life with addition of 
Assessment report

obinutuzumab  to  bendamustine.  The  time  to  worsening  of  quality  of  life,  measured  by  FACT-Lym  TOI 
score was extended with obinutuzumab treatment.  
Safety data suggested, that older patients and patients with impaired renal function, were more at risk of 
clinically  important  AEs  than  younger  patients  with  better  renal  function.  However  these  observations 
applied to both treatment arms and indicate that patients in this clinical setting have a general risk to AEs 
rather than a risk to obinutuzumab-related events. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall, there were no unexpected safety findings or new important risks identified, , the nature, 
frequency and severity of ARs was consistent with previous experience with obinutuzumab monotherapy,  
and the regimen of G-benda induction followed by extended treatment with obinutuzumab (maintenance) 
was manageable and feasible. Safety updates will be provided on an ongoing basis within the PSURs; 
study completion is expected to occur Q4 2019 and submission of the Final Study report Q4 2020.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The PSUR cycle remains unchanged.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity to make editorial changes to sections 4.4, 4.6, 5.3 and 6.6 of 
the SmPC. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template which 
accepted by the CHMP. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
MAH show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In GAO4753g the subgroup of FL comprised 81.1% of the ITT population of iNHL. A 52% reduction in the 
risk of PD or death based on IRC assessment was observed; the HR for IRC-assessed PFS was 0.48 (95% 
CI:  0.34,  0.68,  stratified  log-rank  p-value  <0.0001).  The  median  PFS  was  13.8 months  (95%  CI:  11.4; 
16.2)  in  the  benda  arm  and  had  not  been  reached  in  the  G-benda  arm.    PFS  as  assessed  by  the 
Investigator confirmed the IRC-assessed PFS results (HR =0.48; 95% CI: 0.35, 0.67, p-value < 0.0001,

stratified  log-rank  test).  The  median  investigator  assessed  PFS  in  the  G-benda  arm  (29.2  months  [95% 
CI: 17.5; NE]) was over twice as long as that in the benda arm (13.7 months [95% CI: 11.0; 15.5]). 
Consistent  efficacy  results  for  the  IRC-assessed  PFS  were  observed  in  a  panel  of  sensitivity  analyses 
including  re-randomization  test,  unstratified  analysis,  several  exploratory  analyses  applying  different 
censoring  rules  to  evaluate  alternative  definitions  of  PFS  (HRs  for  IRC-assessed  PFS:  0.44-0.57),  and 
subgroups  of  patients  with  FL  based  on  demographics,  baseline  factors  and  potential  disease prognostic 
markers. 
The  benefit  of  adding  obinutuzumab  to  bendamustine  in  patients  with  FL  was  further  supported  by  the 
secondary  efficacy  endpoints  demonstrating 
  Results  of

the 
arms.  The DoR for patients who achieved a CR/PR, and DFS for complete responders were longer in the 
G-benda arm compared with the benda arm.  Hazard ratios were 0.36 (95% CI: 0.24, 0.54) for DoR and 
0.10  (95%  CI:  0.02,  0.44)  for  DFS.  At  the  time  of  the  analysis,  median  OS  could  not  be  estimated  in 
either  treatment  arm.  The  updated  OS  data  show  that  the  median  OS  has  not  been  reached  yet,  but 
fewer  patients  with  FL  had  died  in  the  G-benda  arm  (30/164  [18.3%])  compared  to  the  benda  arm 
(48/171 [28.1%]). The HR for risk of death in patients with FL was 0.62 (95%CI: 0.39, 0.98) for G-benda 
vs.  benda.  The  Kaplan  -  Meier  plot  for  OS  in  patients  with  FL  showed  a  clear  separation  of  curves  in 
favour of the G-benda arm from 6 months and beyond. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
At  the  time  of  the  analysis,  median  OS  could  not  be  estimated  due  to  small  numbers  and  a  relatively 
short follow-up but a trend towards an improvement in OS is indicated. A final OS analysis will take place 
after approximately 226 deaths have occurred. The final OS results will be provided with the submission 
of the final study report.  
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
Despite  the  difference  in  treatment  duration  and  safety  reporting  in  the  two  arms,  the  incidence  of  AEs 
(all  grades)  (98.0%  of  patients  in  the  benda  arm  vs.  98.5%  of  patients  in  the  G-benda  arm),  deaths 
(20.7% vs. 17.5%), and fatal AEs (6.1% vs. 6.2%) were similar in the two treatment arms. However a 
higher incidence of Grade 3-5 AEs, SAEs, and AEs leading to withdrawal with G-benda was reported in the 
G-benda  arm.  The  greater  incidence  of  these  events  was  mainly  due  to  neutropenia  and  IRRs.  In  both 
treatment  arms,  most  fatal  AEs  were  infections  or  second  malignancies  and  there  was  no  notable 
imbalance in the incidence of particular fatal events between the arms.   
Thrombocytopenia  was  more  frequently  reported  in  the  benda  arm  (23.7%)  than  the  G-benda  arm 
(14.9%); consistent with the higher dose of bendamustine in the benda arm.   
Overall,  the  nature,  frequency  and  severity  of  AEs  of  particular  or  special  interest  in  this  pivotal  study 
(IRRs,  neutropenia, 
infection 
[including  progressive  multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy],  TLS, 
thrombocytopenia  [including  hemorrhagic  events],  cardiac  events,  second  malignancy  and  HBV 
reactivation)  were  consistent  with  previous  experience.    Despite  the  frequent  incidence  of  IRRs,  most 
patients  in  the  G-benda  arm  received  the  full  dose  of  obinutuzumab  and  were  able  to  continue  with 
obinutuzumab therapy.  The first dose of obinutuzumab could be split over two days if required for IRRs 
but only one patient had a split dose. 
The safety profile of obinutuzumab in combination with bendamustine in the subgroup of patients with FL 
was  consistent  with  those  for  the  overall  iNHL  (ITT)  population.    Overall,  the  safety  profile  of 
obinutuzumab  in  patients  with  iNHL  in  the  supporting  studies  was  consistent  with  the  pivotal  Study

GAO4753g and supports the overall safety of obinutuzumab in combination with bendamustine, as well as 
the  safety  of  continued  treatment  with  obinutuzumab  monotherapy.    The  supporting  studies  provided 
additional evidence regarding the long-term safety of obinutuzumab.  Overall, the incidence of AEs during 
obinutuzumab maintenance treatment was lower than during induction.   
Safety  data  from  supporting  monotherapy  Studies  BO20999  and  BO21003  demonstrated  that 
obinutuzumab  was  well  tolerated  at  the  doses  administered  in  these  Phase  I/II  studies.  There  were  no 
reports  of  dose-limiting  toxicities  in  the  Phase  I  stages  of  the  studies  and,  in  general,  no  unexpected 
safety  issues.    Similarly,  in  the  combination  Study  BO21000  in  first-line  and  relapsed/refractory  setting 
the  safety  profile  of  obinutuzumab  plus  chemotherapy  was  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profiles  of 
the individual study drugs (CHOP, FC, or bendamustine). No new important safety signals were reported 
during maintenance treatment with obinutuzumab in this study. 
Gastrointestinal perforation was identified as an important identified risk following an integrated analysis 
of  the  two  cases  of  GI  perforation  reported  in  Study  GAO4753g  and  the  three  reported  cases  of  GI 
perforation among obinutuzumab-exposed patients in the supporting studies.   
In  study  GAO4753g,  the  risk  of  IRRs  is  frequent  with  G-benda,  in  particular  during  the  first  cycle  of 
treatment  (55.2%  patients  have  an  IRR  in  cycle  1).  This  is  coherent  with  the  experience  we  have  with 
GAZYVARO.  Supportive 
therapies  (e.g.,  supplemental  oxygen,  β2-agonists/epinephrine,  and/or 
corticosteroids) were allowed for serious IRRs according to standard clinical practice. Management of IRRs 
is described in the SmPC section 4.2. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The  proportion  of  patients  who  experienced  second  malignancies  6  months  after  starting  treatment  or 
later was 5.1% in the benda arm and 7.2% in the G-benda arm. There remains some uncertainty about 
the long-term risk of secondary cancer (See RMP).  
The incidence of types of infections shows no clear pattern. The incidence of infections/infestations could 
be  related  to  neutropenia and  the  IgG  level.  Although  no  trend  is  reported,  there  might  exist  especially 
vulnerable populations, which require special attention and where IgG substitution should be considered 
(See RMP). Safety updates of GA04753g study will be submitted on an ongoing basis within the PSURs.

Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Patients with relapsing-remitting follicular lymphoma, resistant to chemotherapeutic agents and to 
rituximab which may progress to a more aggressive high-grade lymphoma have very limited treatment 
options and poor prognosis. Bendamustine has been shown to be effective in the treatment of patients 
with rituximab-refractory iNHL. 
Although both rituximab and obinutuzumab targets CD20, the binding epitopes as well as their effects are 
different.  Treatment with G-benda resulted in a statistically clinically relevant and significant reduction by 
45%  in  the  risk  of  IRC-assessed  PFS  compared  with  benda  alone  (HR=0.55  (95%  CI:  0.40,  0.74;  log-
rank  p-value  =  0.0001).  The  Kaplan-Meier  estimated  median  PFS  was  14.9  months  in  the  benda  arm 
(95%  CI:  12.8,  16.6), it was  not  reached  in  the  G-benda  arm.  The  results  of  investigator-assessed  PFS 
were  consistent  with  the  primary  analysis,  median  PFS  was  14.0  months  in  the  benda  arm  and  29.2 
months  in  the  G-benda  arm  (HR  0.52,  95%  CI:  0.39,  0.70;  log-rank  test  p-value<0.0001).  Updated 
analyses of PFS are consistent with the primary analysis. The updated OS data show that the median OS 
has  not  been  reached  yet,  but  fewer  patients  with  FL  had  died  in  the  G-benda  arm  (30/164  [18.3%]) 
compared to the benda arm (48/171 [28.1%]).  
The tolerability of the combined regimen appears as expected in this clinical setting.  
Benefit-risk balance  
The benefit-risk balance of Gazyvaro in combination with bendamustine followed by Gazyvaro 
maintenance for the treatment of patients with follicular lymphoma (FL) who did not respond or who 
progressed during or up to 6 months after treatment with rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen, is 
positive. 
Discussion on the Benefit-Risk Balance 
The natural history of iNHL is chemo-sensitive and with a generally good prognosis at diagnoses, but 
relapsing-remitting with serial intermittent courses of treatment required over several years. Typically the 
diseases become increasingly resistant to chemotherapeutic agents and to rituximab as well as histologic 
transformation to high-grade NHL can occur which are more aggressive. Bendamustine has been shown 
to be effective in the treatment of patients with rituximab-refractory iNHL, but there is clearly an unmert 
medical need in this setting. 
The  difference  in  PFS  between  the  two  treatment  arms  in  patients  with  FL,  favouring  obinutuzumab  + 
bendamustine  followed  by  obinutuzumab  maintenance  is  statistically  significant  and  clinically  important 
and seems robust, although the OS data are still not mature. Further, a longer DoR and DFS was reported 
in  the  G-benda  arm  compared  with  the  benda  arm.  There  is  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically

meaningful reduction in the risk of PD or death with the association obinutuzumab + bendamustine in the 
FL  population.  The  overall  survival  update  from  the  pivotal  trial  will  be  provided  with  the  final  analysis, 
which  was defined as the  time point when 226 deaths will have occurred. Study completion is expected 
by Q4 2019. 
The safety profile is acceptable. Updated safety information will be included in the PSURs.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
This AR concerns 4 studies (+ 1 study Annex) which were submitted by the MAH to comply with Article 
45 of the regulation 1901/2006. 
Apart from the 4 study reports and accompanying study Annex, there were investigator approvals and 
very brief expert statements provided. Neither clinical overview, nor clinical summaries were present in 
the dossier. 
The  MAH’s  experts  stated  that  the  submitted  paediatric  studies  do  not  influence  the  benefit  risk  for 
Rotarix  and  that  subsequently  there  are  neither  consequential  regulatory  actions  nor  changes  to  the 
product information necessary.

STUDY SUMMARIES 
Study 103478 
  General 
A  phase  IIIb,  double-blind,  randomized,  placebo-controlled,  multicentre  study  to  assess  the 
immunogenicity,  safety  and  reactogenicity  of  2  doses  of  GlaxoSmithKline  (GSK)  Biologicals.  oral  live 
attenuated  human  rotavirus  (HRV)  vaccine  in  healthy  infants  (6-12  weeks  of  age  at  first  dose) 
previously uninfected with human rotavirus. 
• 
Objective(s) 
Primary: 
• 
To show a difference of at least 20% in seroconversion rate at Visit 3 (two months post-dose 
2) between HRV and placebo groups. 
Criteria:  the  primary  objective  was  reached  if  the  lower  limit  of  the  two-sided  asymptotic 
standardized 95% CI for treatment difference (HRV minus placebo) was ≥ 20%. 
Secondary: 
• 
• 
• 
To assess the reactogenicity and safety of each dose of the HRV vaccine versus placebo. 
To  assess  the  immunogenicity  of  the  HRV  vaccine  in  terms  of  serum  anti-RV  IgA  antibody 
concentrations at Visit 3 (at two months post-dose 2). 
To assess the presence of rotavirus (RV) in gastroenteritis (GE) stools collected until Visit 3. 
• 
Study design 
The study was designed as a randomized (2:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, self-contained study 
with two parallel groups that received the following vaccines: 
• 
• 
Two oral doses of HRV (HRV vaccine group) 
Two oral doses of Placebo (Placebo group) 
All  subjects  received  routine  childhood  vaccinations  according  to  local  immunization  recommendation 
(2,  4,  6  months  schedule).  All  routine  vaccinations  were  to  be  given  at  least  14  days  prior  to 
administration of HRV vaccine or placebo dose and Hib vaccine was to be administered at the time of 
HRV or placebo dose. Blood samples were drawn from all subjects prior to the first vaccine dose (Visit 
1) and two months after the second vaccine dose (Visit 3). 
The study duration was approximately 4 months for each subject.

Study population /Sample size 
Inclusion criteria: 
Healthy infants aged between 6 and 12 weeks (42-90 days) of age at the time of the first vaccination 
whom  were  free  of  obvious  health  problems  and  for  whom  the  vaccination  history  was  available. 
Written informed consent was obtained from the parent or guardian of the subject. 
• 
Endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
• 
Percentage of subjects who seroconverted at Visit 3 (percentage of subjects with concentration ≥ 
20 U/ ml in subjects who were seronegative before vaccination). 
Secondary endpoints 
•  Occurrence of any grade 2 or grade 3 fever, vomiting or diarrhoea within the 15-day (Day 0 - Day 
14) solicited follow-up period after each study vaccine dose. 
• 
For each type of solicited symptoms, occurrence of  the symptom within the 15-day (Day 0 - Day 
14) solicited follow-up period after each study vaccine dose. 
•  Occurrence of unsolicited adverse events within 43 days (Day 0- Day 42) after each study vaccine 
dose according to MedDRA classification. 
•  Occurrence of serious adverse events throughout the study period.

Visit 3. 
• 
• 
Presence of RV in GE stools collected from Dose 1 of HRV vaccine/ placebo up to Visit 3. 
Statistical Methods 
Analysis of Demography 
Demographic characteristics on age at Dose 1 and Dose 2 of HRV vaccine/ placebo, height and weight 
at Visit 1, gender and race distribution were tabulated by group. 
Analysis of Immunogenicity 
Rotarix 
P45 046 
Page 3/33 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Immunogenicity analysis was performed on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity (primary analysis) and 
on the total vaccinated cohort. At each time point that serum anti-rotavirus IgA antibody response was 
measured,  seropositivity/  seroconversion  rates  and  their  exact  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  were 
calculated  for  each  group.  Geometric  mean  concentrations  (GMCs)  and  their  95%  CI  were  calculated 
for each group. GMCs and their 95% CI were also calculated on the subjects who were seropositive for 
anti-rotavirus IgA antibody. 
The  two-sided  asymptotic  standardized  95%  CI  for  difference  in  the  percentage  of  subjects  who 
seroconverted  for  anti-rotavirus  IgA  at  Visit  3  between  HRV  and  placebo  groups  was  computed.  The 
primary objective was reached if the lower limit of the two-sided asymptotic standardized 95% CI for 
treatment  difference  (HRV  minus  placebo)  in  the  percentage  of  subjects  who  seroconverted  for 
antirotavirus IgA antibody at Visit 3 was above the pre-defined clinical limit of 20%. 
Analysis of Reactogenicity and Safety 
The  safety  analysis  was  performed  on  the  total  vaccinated  cohort  (primary  analysis)  and  on  the  ATP 
cohort. The percentage of doses and of subjects with any symptom (solicited or unsolicited) reported 
during  the  15-day  (Day  0  to  Day  14)  follow-up  period  and  with  each  solicited  symptoms  reported 
during  the  15-day  solicited  follow-up  period  was  tabulated  by  group  with  their  exact  95%  CIs.  The 
percentage of doses and of subjects with unsolicited AEs classified by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) system reported during the 43-day (Day 0 to Day 42) follow-up period after any 
HRV vaccine or placebo dose were tabulated by group with their exact 95% CIs. 
The same calculations were done for symptoms rated as grade "3" in intensity and for those assessed 
as causally related to vaccination. The percentage of doses and of subjects reporting diarrhoea, fever 
or vomiting graded 2 or 3 in intensity was calculated by group, with exact 95% CIs, over the solicited 
follow-up  period  (Day  0  to  Day  14).  SAEs  and  withdrawals  due  to  non-serious  AEs/  SAEs  were 
described. The percentage of subjects with GE and RV (vaccine strain or wild-type RV) GE from Dose 1 
of HRV vaccine or placebo to Visit 3 was tabulated by group with their exact 95% CIs. 
  Results 
Demography 
The  demographic  profile  of  the  two  groups  at  Dose  1  was  similar  with  respect  to  mean  age,  height, 
weight,  gender  and  racial  distribution.  The  mean  age  of  the  subjects  in  the  ATP  cohort  for 
immunogenicity  was  10.3  weeks  (range:  7  to12  weeks)  at  the  time  of  the  first  vaccination  and  19.1 
weeks (range: 16 to 21 weeks) at the time of the second vaccination. All subjects were Korean. 
Immunogenicity 
ATP cohort for immunogenicity: 
The anti-rotavirus IgA antibody seroconversion rate was 66.7% [95% CI: 51.6%; 79.6%] in the HRV 
vaccine group and 4.2% [95% CI: 0.1%; 21.1%] in the placebo group at two months after Dose 2. 
The lower limit of the two sided asymptotic standardized 95% CI for the difference in the percentage of 
subjects  who  seroconverted  for  anti-rotavirus  IgA  antibody  at  two  months  after  Dose  2  between  the 
HRV vaccine group and (minus) the placebo group was 42.81% which is above the pre-defined clinical 
limit of 20%. Thus, from the above data, it was concluded that the primary objective was met.

TV cohort: 
The anti-rotavirus IgA antibody seroconversion rate was 65.3% [95% CI: 53.1%, 76.1%] in the HRV 
vaccine group and 5.4% [95% CI: 0.7%, 18.2%] in the placebo group. 
The lower limit of the two sided asymptotic standardised 95% CI for the difference between groups in 
percentage of subjects who seroconverted for anti-rotavirus IgA antibody at Visit 3 was 44.17%. This 
result was consistent with the result obtained with the ATP cohort for immunogenicity.

• 
• 
The incidence of any symptom (solicited or unsolicited) reported during the 15-day (Day 0 to Day 
14) follow-up period was similar between the two groups. There was no increase in the incidence 
of symptoms after Dose 2 compared to Dose 1. 
The incidence of symptoms (solicited or unsolicited) rated as grade 3 in intensity reported during 
the 15-day (Day 0 to Day 14) follow-up period was similar in the two groups. 
The  incidence  of  symptoms  (solicited  or  unsolicited)  considered  by  the  investigator  as  causally 
related  to  vaccination  reported  during  the  15-day  (Day  0  to  Day  14)  follow-up  period  was  also 
similar between the two groups. There was no increase in incidence of causally related symptoms 
(solicited or unsolicited) with subsequent doses. 
The percentage of subjects reporting diarrhoea, fever or vomiting graded 2 or 3 in intensity during 
the 15-day follow-up period after vaccination was similar in both the groups. 
The  percentage  of  subjects  with  report  of  at  least  one  unsolicited  symptom  within  the  43-day 
follow-up  period  after  any  vaccination  was  similar  in  both  the  groups:  53.4%  [95%  CI:  43.3%; 
63.3%] in the HRV vaccine group and 59.6% [95% CI: 45.1%; 73.0%] in the placebo group. 
•  RV  was  isolated  from  two  reported  GE  episodes  with  available  stool  samples  for  RV  testing  from 
Dose 1 up to Visit 3 (one subject in each group). The wild type of the serotype G1P[8] was isolated 
from both stool samples. Onset of RV GE episode was reported 30 days and 10 days after Dose 2 
for the subjects in the HRV vaccine group and placebo group, respectively. The intensity of RV GE 
episodes  were  graded  by  the  investigator  as  grade  1  (mild)  for  the  HRV  vaccine  recipient  and 
grade  2  (moderate)  for  placebo  recipient.  No  vaccine  strain  was  detected  in  any  of  the  stool 
samples tested. 
•  SAEs: No fatal SAEs were reported during the study. Non-fatal SAEs were reported in 11 subjects 
(9 subjects in the HRV vaccine group and 2 subjects in the placebo group). All SAEs except one in 
the HRV vaccine group (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura in n227) were considered by the 
investigator not to be causally related to study vaccination. All subjects recovered from the SAEs. 
•  No intussusception case was reported during the study. 
• 
There was no report of discontinuation from the study due to an AE/ SAE.

 
Conclusions: 
•  GSK  Biologicals.  HRV  vaccine  was  immunogenic  in  Korean  infants  who  were  a  part  of  the  ATP 
cohort  for  immunogenicity  as  shown  by  the  anti-rotavirus  IgA  antibody  seroconversion  rate  of 
66.7% [95% CI: 51.6%, 79.6%] observed in the HRV vaccine group at two months after Dose 2. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The  anti-rotavirus  IgA  antibody  seroconversion  rate  observed  in  the  HRV  vaccine  group  at  two 
months after Dose 2 in the total vaccinated cohort was 65.3% [95% CI: 53.1%; 76.1%]. 
The  lower  limit  of  the  two-sided  asymptotic  standardized  95%  CI  for  treatment  difference  (HRV 
minus placebo) in the percentage of subjects who seroconverted for anti-rotavirus IgA antibody at 
two  months  after  Dose  2  was  above  the  pre-defined  clinical  limit  of  20%  in  the  ATP  cohort  for 
immunogenicity thus, meeting the primary objective of the study. The results obtained in the total 
vaccinated cohort were consistent with those of the ATP cohort for immunogenicity. 
The reactogenicity profiles of the HRV vaccine group and placebo group were similar. 
There was no evidence of a clinically meaningful difference between the HRV vaccine group and the 
placebo  group  for  SAEs  reported  from  Dose  1  up  to  Visit  3  or  unsolicited  AEs  reported  within  43 
days (Day 0 to Day 42) after vaccination. 
Assessor’s  comment:  Study  103478  sought  to  investigate  the  immunogenicity  and  safety  of  the 
Rotarix vaccine in children aged 6 to 12 weeks whom have never suffered a rota-virus infection prior to 
vaccination.  Review  of  the  study  did  not  raise  any  issues  regarding  neither  the  safety  nor  the 
immunogenicity in this study group and the MAH’s conclusions are corroborated.

Study design 
This  was  a  phase  IIIb,  double-blind,  randomised,  placebo-controlled,  self-contained  study  with  two 
groups. The treatment groups were: 
•  Group HRV received 106.5 CCID50 HRV vaccine 
•  Group Placebo received placebo. 
The  administration  of  hepatitis  B,  Bacille  Calmette-Guerin  (BCG)  and  oral  poliovirus  vaccine  (OPV) 
vaccinations  at  birth  were  allowed  according  to  local  universal  immunisation  program  (UIP)  schedule 
and were to be documented in the case report form (CRF). Following the UIP recommendation in India, 
routine diphtheria-tetanus-whole cell pertussis-hepatitis B (DTPw-HB),  Haemophilus influenzae type b 
(Hib)  and  OPV  vaccines  was  administered  at  6,  10  and  14  weeks  of  age  (given  with  a  two  week 
separation  from  the  first  and  subsequent  dose  of  the  study  vaccine/placebo).  Blood  samples  were 
collected from all subjects for the assessment of immunogenicity of the HRV vaccine at Visit 1 and at

Statistical Methods 
Analysis of Demography 
Demographic characteristics on age at Dose 1 and Dose 2 of HRV vaccine/placebo, height and weight 
at Visit 1,racial and gender composition were tabulated by group. The increase in height and weight of 
the subjects from Visit 1 to Visit 3 was tabulated by group. Summary of feeding practices on the day of 
each  study  vaccination  was  presented  by  group.  The  summary  of  concomitant  vaccinations 
administered from Dose 1 of HRV/placebo up to Visit 3 were summarised by group. The percentage of 
subjects  in  the  below  mentioned  three  concomitant  vaccination  categories  were  calculated  for  each 
group 
•  without  concomitant  vaccinations.  category  (i.e.  subjects  with  no  vaccination  administered  within 
13 days of both doses of HRV/placebo, excluding subjects who might have been administered with 
OPV (as per the government immunisation programme) within 13 days of HRV/placebo doses) 
•  with  concomitant  vaccinations.  category  (i.e.  subjects  with  at  least  one  vaccination  administered 
within 13 days of at least one dose of HRV/placebo, excluding the unknown OPV administration (as 
per the government immunisation programme)) 
•  with  unknown  concomitant  vaccinations.  (i.e.  subjects  who  do  not  belong  to  .With  concomitant 
vaccination.  or  .Without  concomitant  vaccination.  i.e.  subject  who  might  have  been  administered 
with OPV (as per the government immunisation programme) within 13 days of at least one dose of 
HRV/placebo and without vaccination administered within 13 days of both doses of HRV/placebo) 
Analysis of Immunogenicity 
Anti-RV  IgA  antibody  seropositivity/seroconversion  rates  and  GMCs  (also  calculated  on  seropositive 
subjects) with their 95% confidence interval (CI) were tabulated. 
As per protocol, a minimum interval of two weeks between the administration of the study vaccine and 
the  administration  of  concomitant  vaccines  was  to be  observed.  However,  approximately  one  third of 
enrolled  subjects  received  routine  vaccinations  in  this  forbidden  interval  and  for  some  subjects  OPV 
administration  was  unknown.  Therefore,  the  above  mentioned  analyses  were  also  explored  by  three 
concomitant vaccination categories. The distribution of the ratio of post- over pre-vaccination for anti-
rotavirus IgA antibody concentrations in subjects seropositive at prevaccination was explored by group. 
Analysis of Safety 
The  percentage  of  doses  and  of  subjects  with  any  symptom  (solicited  or  unsolicited)  reported  during 
the 8-day (Day 0 to Day 7) follow-up period and with each solicited general symptom reported during 
the 8-day solicited follow-up period was tabulated by group with their exact 95% CIs. 
The  percentage  of  doses  and  of  subjects  with  unsolicited  AEs  classified  by  Medical  Dictionary  for 
Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) system reported during the 31-day (Day 0 to Day 30) follow-up period 
after any  HRV vaccine or  placebo dose were tabulated by group with their exact 95% CIs. The same 
calculations were done for symptoms rated as grade "3" in intensity and for those assessed as causally 
related to vaccination. The percentage of subjects with GE and RV (vaccine strain or wild-type RV) GE 
from Dose 1 of HRV vaccine or placebo to Visit 3 was tabulated by group with their exact 95% CIs. 
SAEs reported during the study period and withdrawals due to AEs or SAEs were described.  Difference 
between groups was explored using the two-sided Fisher.s exact test for the following endpoints: 
• 
• 
• 
percentage  of  subjects  reporting  each  individual  solicited  general  symptom  within  8-day  (Day  0 
toDay 7) follow-up period after any dose, 
percentage  of  subjects  reporting  each  individual  solicited  general  symptom  graded  3  intensity 
within 8-day (Day 0 to Day 7) follow-up period after any dose, 
percentage of subjects reporting each individual solicited general symptom assessed as related to 
vaccination within 8-day (Day 0 to Day 7) follow-up period after any dose. 
p-values less than 0.05 were used as an indicator of a possible difference between groups. However, 
since  p-values  were  not  adjusted  for  multiplicity  of comparisons,  statistically significant  findings  were 
to be interpreted with caution and also taking into account clinically relevant difference.

  Results 
Demography 
In  the  ATP  cohort  for  immunogenicity,  the  demographic  profile  of  the  two  groups  at  study  entry  was 
similar with respect to mean age, height, weight and BMI. All subjects were Indian. 
Immunogenicity 
Analysis  was  performed  on  the  ATP  cohort  for  immunogenicity  (primary  analysis)  and  on  the  Total 
vaccinated cohort. Included in the ATP cohort were all subjects who received concomitant vaccinations 
in the forbidden interval but who complied with other study criteria. 
At Visit 3: 
• 
• 
The anti-rotavirus IgA antibody seroconversion rates were 58.3% [95% CI: 48.7%; 67.4%] in the 
HRV  Group.  Similar  seroconversion  rates  were  observed  in  subjects  without  concomitant 
vaccination  (55.7%  [95%  CI:  43.3%;  67.6%]),  in  subjects  with  concomitant  vaccination  (65.7% 
[95% CI: 47.8%; 80.9%]) and for subjects with unknown concomitant vaccination (50% [95% CI: 
18.7%; 81.3%]) 
The  seroconversion  rates  were  6.3%  [95%  CI:  2.5%;  12.5%]  in  the  Placebo  Group,  indicating 
natural infection with wild type RV had occurred in these subjects. 
•  GMCs  calculated  on  subjects  seropositive  for  anti-rotavirus  IgA  was  153.9U/ml  [95%  CI:  113.3 
U/ml;  209.0  U/ml]  in  the  HRV  Group  and  81.6  U/ml  [95%  CI:  27.4  U/ml;  242.8  U/ml]  in  the 
Placebo Group. 
• 
The  lower  limit  of  the  two  sided  asymptotic  standardised  95%  CI  for  the  difference  in  the 
percentage  of  subjects  who  seroconverted  for  anti-rotavirus  IgA  antibody  at  Visit  3  between  the 
HRV vaccine Group and (minus) the Placebo Group was 41.46% indicating that the seroconversion 
rate was significantly higher in the HRV vaccine group as compared to that in the Placebo Group.

Safety results 
Analysis was performed on Total vaccinated cohort (primary analysis) and on ATP cohort for safety. 
Any symptom: 
• 
The  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  any,  grade  3  symptoms  and  symptoms  causally  related  to 
vaccination (solicited or unsolicited) during the 8-day (Day 0 to Day 7) follow-up period after any 
dose  was  similar  between  both  groups.  The  incidence  of  any  symptoms  was  similar  after  Dose  1 
and Dose 2 in both groups indicating no increase in symptoms with subsequent doses. 
Solicited general symptoms: 
• 
The  percentage  of  subjects  for  who  solicited  general  symptom  was  reported  during  the  8-day 
follow-up  period  after  vaccination  was  similar  in  both  groups.  Cough/runny  nose  were  the  most 
commonly  reported  symptoms.  Statistically  significant  differences  were  not  detected  between  the 
two  groups  with  respect  to  the    percentage  of  subjects  reporting  any  individual  solicited  general 
symptom  including  those  rated  as  grade  3  in  intensity  and  those  assessed  as  causally  related  to 
vaccination  during  the  8-day  followup  period  after  any  HRV  vaccine  or  placebo  dose  (p-value  > 
0.05, two-sided Fisher.s exact test).

Unsolicited symptoms: 
• 
The percentage of subjects for whom at least one unsolicited symptom was reported within the 31- 
day  follow-up  period  after  any  vaccination  was  similar  in  both  groups:  19.8 %  [95%  CI:  14.3%; 
26.3%]  of  subjects  in  the  HRV  Group  and  17.7%  [95%  CI:  12.4%;  24.0%]  of  subjects  in  the 
Placebo Group. 
Rotavirus in stool samples collected during GE episodes: 
•  Of all the GE episodes reported from Dose 1 of HRV vaccine or placebo up to Visit 3, stool samples 
were  not  available  from  30.4%  of  the  GE  episodes  in  the  HRV  Group  and  from  15.4%  of  the  GE 
episodes in the Placebo Group. 
• 
The  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  GE  episodes  from  Dose  1  of  HRV  vaccine  or  placebo  up  to 
Visit 3 was 12.6% [95% CI: 8.2%; 18.4%] in the HRV Group and 13.3% [95% CI: 8.7%; 19.1%] 
in the Placebo Group. 
•  RV  was  not  isolated  from  any  of  the  tested  stool  samples  collected  in  case  of  GE  episodes  up  to 
Visit 3 
Serious adverse events: 
Five subjects (three in the HRV Group and two in the Placebo Group) reported non-fatal SAEs. None of 
these were considered by the investigator to be causally related to vaccination. All SAEs resolved. No 
deaths or intussusception cases occurred during the study. 
Withdrawals due to adverse events/serious adverse events: 
One  subject  (n203)  in  the  HRV  Group  withdrew  from  the  study  due  to  diarrhoea  (non-serious 
adverse event). 
Concomitant medications: 
The percentage of subjects who started taking at least one concomitant medication from Day 0 to Day 
7 after any vaccination was similar in both groups. The percentage of subjects who started taking any 
antipyretic  or  any  antibiotic  from  Day  0  to  Day  7  after  any  vaccination  was  similar  in  both  groups. 
None of the subjects started taking prophylactic antipyretic medication from Day 0 to Day 7 after any 
vaccination.

Conclusions: 
The  immune  response  in  the  ATP  cohort  for  immunogenicity  in  terms  of  anti-rotavirus 
seroconversion  rates  in  the  group  receiving  HRV  vaccine  was  58.3%  [95%  CI:  48.7%;  67.4%] 
which was significantly higher than the seroconversion observed in the Placebo Group (6.3% [95% 
CI:  2.5%;  12.5%]).  The  results  observed  from  the  analysis  for  the  total  vaccinated  cohort  were 
consistent with the results observed with the ATP cohort for immunogenicity. 
The HRV vaccine was well tolerated and the reactogenicity profile of the HRV  vaccine was similar 
when  compared  to  the  reactogenicity  profile  of  placebo.  No  SAEs  causally  related  to  vaccination 
were reported. 
•  RV  was  not  isolated  from  any  of  the  tested  stool  samples  collected  in  case  of  GE  episodes  up  to 
Visit 3 
Assessor’s  comment:  Study  103792  investigated  the  seroconversion  rate  in  children 
vaccinated  with  Rotarx  using  a  twofold  administration  versus  placebo.  The  primary  endpoint 
was  easily  met,  with  the  vaccinated  cohort  showing  a  more  or  less  ten  times  higher 
seroconversion rate versus the placebo. Safety and reactogenity of the vaccine was also shown 
to  be  good,  and  rota-virus  was  undetectable  in  any  of  the  stool  samples  taken  from  patients 
presenting with gastro-enteritis during the trial. The MAH’s conclusions drawn from the results 
are thus corroborated.

Statistical Methods 
Analysis of Demography 
Demographic characteristics (descriptive statistics on age at Visit 1, Dose 1 and Dose 2 of HRV vaccine 
or  placebo,  height  and  weight  at  Visit  1  and  gender  and  race  distribution)  were  tabulated  for  each 
group.  Increase  in  height  and  weight  from  Visit  1  to  Visit  3,  Visit  5  and  Visit  6  was  summarised  by 
group. 
Analysis of Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity  analysis  was  performed  on  the  (ATP)  cohort  for  immunogenicity  (primary  analysis) 
and the total vaccinated cohort. 
All subjects: 
At  each  time  point  that  serum  antibody  response  to  a  given  antigen  was  measured, 
seroprotection/seroconversion/seropositivity  rates  and  their  exact  95%  CI  were  calculated  by  group 
and for pooled placebo groups. GMCs/GMTs and their 95% CI were calculated by group and for pooled 
placebo groups. GMCs and their 95% CI were also calculated on the subjects who had seroconverted 
to anti-rotavirus IgA antibody. 
The  asymptotic  standardised  95%  CI  for  difference  between  the  two  HRV  groups  and  between  each 
HRV group and the pooled placebo group was computed for each of the following endpoints separately. 
-  the  percentage  of  subjects  who  seroconverted  for  anti-rotavirus  IgA  antibody;  the  corresponding 
one-sided asymptotic standardised P-value was also computed 
- seroprotection rates for each anti-polio type 1, 2 and 3 antibodies 
Stool analysis subset: 
The  percentage  of  subjects  with  presence  of  RV  in  stool  samples  collected  at  pre-determined  time 
points (shedding) was tabulated by group and for pooled placebo groups. The percentage of subjects 
with vaccine take at Visit 6 was calculated by group and for pooled placebo groups with its exact 95% 
CI. 
Analysis of Safety 
The  safety  analysis  was  performed  on  the  total  vaccinated  cohort  (primary  analysis)  and  the  ATP 
cohort for safety. The percentages of doses and of subjects with any symptom (solicited or unsolicited) 
reported during the 8-day follow-up period and with specific solicited symptoms reported during the 8-
day (Day 0 to Day 7) solicited follow-up period were tabulated by group with their exact 95% CI. The 
percentages  of  doses  and  of  subjects  with  unsolicited  adverse  events  classified  by  MedDRA  system 
reported during the 31-day follow-up period after any HRV vaccine or placebo dose were tabulated by 
group with their exact 95% CI. The same calculations were done for symptoms rated as grade "3" in 
intensity and for those assessed as related to vaccination. 
Differences  between  the  two  HRV  groups  and  between  each  HRV  group  and  pooled  placebo  groups 
were explored using two-sided Fisher Exact test for each individual solicited symptom (any, grade "3", 
related)  reported  within  the  8-day  follow-up  period  after  any  HRV  vaccine  or  placebo  dose.  Due  to 
multiple endpoints analysed without multiplicity adjustment, statistically significant differences (Pvalue 
<  0.05)  should  be  interpreted  cautiously  and  the  differences  observed  in  this  study  could  occur  by 
chance alone. 
The percentages of subjects with gastroenteritis (GE) and RV (vaccine strain or wild-type RV) GE from 
Dose  1  of  HRV  vaccine  or  placebo  to  Visit  6  were  tabulated  by  group  with  their  exact  95%  CI.  SAEs 
/withdrawals due to AE/SAEs were described.

The  demographic  profile  of  the  four  groups  at  study  entry  (Visit  1)  was  similar  with  respect  to  mean 
age, gender, racial distribution, height and weight. All subjects were of Bangladeshi origin. The mean 
age of subjects was 12.3 weeks at the time of the first HRV vaccine or placebo dose, 16.7 weeks at the 
time of the second HRV vaccine or placebo dose. The mean increase in height and weight were similar 
between the groups after the full vaccination course. The intended duration of the study, per subject, 
was approximately 3.5 months.

Analysis was performed on the ATP cohort for immunogenicity (primary analysis). 
•  Table 8 presents the anti-rotavirus IgA antibody GMC and seroconversion rates. Approximately one 
month after Dose 2 of HRV vaccine, the anti-rotavirus IgA antibody seroconversion rate was 56.5% 
[95% CI: 44.0%; 68.4%] in group HRV+OPV and 66.7% [95% CI: 54.0%; 77.8%] in group HRV.  
•  The  18.6  %  of  seroconversion  observed  in  the  pooled  placebo  group  at  Visit  6  indicated  that 
natural  infection  with  wild  type  RV  had  occurred  during  the  study.  The  presence  of  wild  type  RV 
was confirmed by RT-PCR analysis of the diarrhoeal stool samples.  
•  Table 9 presents inferential analysis on anti-rotavirus IgA antibody seroconversion rates at Visit 6. 
A statistically significant increase was detected in group HRV+OPV and in group HRV as compared 
to the pooled placebo group in terms of seroconversion rate at Visit 6 (P-value < 0.05; one-sided 
asymptotic standardised test).  
•  Although  the  seroconversion  rate  at  Visit  6  was  somewhat  lower  in  the  HRV+OPV  group,  a 
statistically  significant  decrease  was  not  detected  in  the  HRV+OPV  group  when  compared  to  the 
HRV group (P-value > 0.05; one-sided asymptotic standardised test) (Table 2).  
• 
In the stool analysis subset, RV shedding was observed at Day 4 and Day 7 after Dose 1 and Dose 
2  of  HRV  vaccine.  The  percentage  of  subjects  with  RV  shedding  at  combined  time  points  was 
17.6% [95% CI: 6.8%; 34.5%] in group HRV+OPV and 31.0% [95% CI: 17.6%; 47.1%] in group 
HRV.  RV  shedding  at  combined  time  points  was  also  detected  in  10.5%  [95%  CI:  2.9%;  24.8%] 
subjects in group pooled placebo.  
•  The  percentage  of  subjects  with  vaccine  take  at  Visit  6  was  51.5%  [95%  CI:  33.5%;  69.2%]  in 
group  HRV+OPV,  73.7%  [95%  CI:  56.9%;  86.6%]  in  group  HRV  and  19.4%  [95%  CI:  8.2%; 
36.0%] in the pooled placebo group. 
•  The  seroprotection  rate  observed  against  poliovirus  type  3  in  Bangladesh  appeared  to  be  lower 
than  seroprotection  rates  observed  in  previous  South  African  studies  but  are  in  line  with 
seroprotection rates observed in other countries using the EPI schedule.  
•  Statistically  significant  differences  were  not  detected  between  each  HRV  group  and  the  pooled 
placebo  group,  and  between  the  two  HRV  groups  in  terms  of  anti-poliovirus  types  1,  type  2  and 
type  3  seroprotection  rates  and  GMTs  at  Visit  6,  except  for  anti-poliovirus  type  2  antibody  GMT 
between the 2 HRV groups (in favour of the HRV+OPV group).

Analysis was performed on the Total Vaccinated Cohort.

• 
• 
The  percentage  of  subjects  with  symptoms  (solicited  or  unsolicited)  reported  within  the  8-day 
(Day  0  to  Day  7)  follow-up  period  after  HRV  vaccine  or  placebo  dose  including  those  rated  as 
grade "3" were similar in all the groups. None were assessed as related to vaccination.  
Table  11  presents  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  each  solicited  general  symptoms  and  those 
graded “3” in intensity during the 8-day (Day 0 to Day 7) follow-up period after any HRV vaccine 
or  placebo  dose.  Irritability  was  the  most  frequently  recorded  solicited  general  symptom  in  all 
groups.  Reports  of  solicited  symptoms  rated  grade  3  in  intensity  were  infrequent  in  all  groups. 
None of the solicited symptoms were considered to be related to vaccination.  
Statistically  significant  differences  were  not  detected  for  the  comparison  between  the  two  HRV 
groups and between each HRV group and the pooled placebo group with respect to the incidence 
of  subjects  reporting  any  individual  solicited  general  symptom  and  those  rated  grade  3  in 
intensity  during  the  8-day  follow-up  period  after  any  HRV  vaccine  or  placebo  dose  (P-value  > 
0.05,  two-sided  Fisher’s  exact  test),  except  for  grade  3  vomiting  between  HRV  group  and  the 
pooled placebo group (P-value = 0.029 in favour of the pooled placebo group). On the contrary, 
there  was  no  significant  difference  in  grade  3  vomiting  between  the  HRV+OPV  group  and  the 
pooled placebo group suggesting that the observed difference with the HRV group was likely to be 
a  chance  finding  due  to  the  number  of  endpoints  analysed  and  to  the  fact  that  no  multiplicity 
adjustment was done. 
The  percentages  of  subjects  with  report  of  at  least  one  unsolicited  symptom  within  the  31-day 
follow-up  period  after  any  vaccination  were  similar  in  all  groups.  None  of  the  unsolicited 
symptoms were determined to have a causal relationship to vaccination.

RV  was  isolated  in  stool  samples  from  seven  subjects  reporting  GE  between  Dose  1  of  HRV 
vaccine  or  placebo  up  to  Visit  6  (two  subjects  in  group  HRV+OPV,  one  subject  in  group  HRV, 
three  subjects  in  group  placebo+OPV  and  one  subject  in  group  placebo).  No  subject  had  more 
than  one  episode  of  RV  GE.  Of  these  seven  RV  GE  episodes,  G2P[4]  was  isolated  in  2  GE  stool 
samples and G12P[6] was isolated in 5 GE stool samples.  
SAEs: One SAE was reported during the study: A fatal SAE (Case ID B0399127A) assessed as not 
related  to  vaccination  (severe  pneumonia  leading  to  cardio  respiratory  and  renal  failure)  was 
reported  in  one  subject  from  group  HRV  on  Day  16  after  Dose  1  of  HRV  vaccine.  No 
intussusception cases were reported during the study.  
•  Withdrawal  due  to  AE/SAE:  One  discontinuation  from  the  study  took  place  due  to  the  fatal  SAE 
described above.

Conclusions: 
The immune response in terms of anti-rotavirus IgA seroconversion rates in the group receiving 
HRV vaccine concomitantly with OPV and in the group receiving HRV vaccine alone (HRV vaccine 
dose  given  15  days  after  the  OPV  dose)  was  of  56.5%  and  66.7%  respectively  which  is 
significantly  higher  than  the  seroconversion  rate  observed  in  the  placebo  groups.  A  statistically 
significant decrease was not detected in the HRV+OPV group when compared to the HRV group.  
Shedding  (17.6%  versus  31.0%)  and  vaccine  take  rates  (51.5%  versus  73.7%)  tended  to  be 
somewhat  lower  in  the  group  receiving  HRV  vaccine  concomitantly  with  OPV  compared  to  the 
group receiving HRV vaccine alone (HRV vaccine dose given 15 days after the OPV dose).  
There  was  no  interference  observed  with  co-administration  of  OPV  with  GSK  Biologicals’  HRV 
vaccine on the immune response to poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3.  
The reactogenicity profile of the group receiving HRV vaccine concomitantly with OPV was similar 
to group receiving HRV vaccine alone (HRV vaccine dose given 15 days after the OPV dose). The 
reactogenicity profile of the HRV vaccine groups was similar to the placebo groups.  
No SAEs related to vaccination were reported. 
Assessor’s  comment:  Study  103992  was  set  up  as  an  investigation  to  compare 
immunogenicity and safety of Rotarix vaccination, both alone and concomitantly with oral polio 
vaccine,  versus  placebo  using  a  four  arm  study  design  (HRV  vs.  HRV+OPV  vs.  placebo  vs. 
placebo+OPV). Immunogenicity results showed a clear superiority of the HRV treatment groups 
versus the placebo groups in anti-rotavirus IgA seroconversion. Although a 10% difference was

noted  between  the  HRV  and  HRV+OPV  groups,  this  difference  was  shown  to  be  statistically 
non-significant. There was neither decrease nor increase noted in the OPV immune response.  
Safety  and  reactogenicity  was  similar  in  all  four  study  arms.  The  results  of  this  trial  thus 
confirm the efficacy and safety of Rotarix when concomitantly administered with OPV. 
Study 107531 
  General 
A  phase  III  randomized  multi-center  study  to  assess  the  immunogenicity  of  three  doses  of  Pediarix, 
Prevnar  and  ActHIB  given  to  healthy  infants  at  2,  4  and  6  months  of  age  when  administered  with 
GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Biologicals two-dose oral live attenuated human rotavirus (HRV) vaccine given 
during the same vaccination visit (at 2 and 4 months of age) or given separately (at 3 and 5 months of 
age). 
• 
Objective(s) 
Primary: 
• 
To demonstrate that the co-administration with GSK Biologicals HRV vaccine does not impair the 
immune  response  to  all  antigens  contained  in  each  of  the  routine  infant  vaccines  (Pediarix, 
Prevnar and ActHIB). 
For this comparison the criteria for non-inferiority 1 month after Dose 3 of routine infant vaccines 
at Visit 6 were specified as follows: 
Lower  limit  of  the  standardized  asymptotic  95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  on  the  difference  (HRV 
co-administration  group  minus  HRV  separate  group)  in  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  anti-
polyribosyl ribitol phosphate (PRP) antibody concentration ≥1.0 μg/mL is ≥ -10% (clinical limit for 
non-inferiority).  
and 
Lower  limits of  the  95%  CIs  on  the  geometric  mean  antibody  concentration  (GMC)  ratios  (HRV 
co-administration  group  divided  by  HRV  separate  group)  for  each  of  the  anti-pertussis  toxoid 
(PT),  anti-filamentous  haemagglutinin  (FHA)  and  anti-pertactin  (PRN)  antibodies  are  ≥0.67 
(clinical limit for non-inferiority). 
and 
Lower  limit  of  the  standardized  asymptotic  95%  CI  on  the  difference  (HRV  co-administration   
group minus HRV separate group) in the percentage of subjects with seroprotective concentration 
(≥10 mIU/mL) for anti-Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) antibodies is ≥ -10% (clinical limit for 
non-inferiority). 
and 
Lower  limits  of  the  95%  CIs  on  the  GMC  ratios  (HRV  co-administration  group  divided  by  HRV 
separate  group)  for  each  of  the  seven  S.  pneumoniae  (Pn)  serotypes  are  ≥0.5  (clinical  limit  for 
non-inferiority).  
and 
Lower limits of the standardized asymptotic 95% CIs on the differences (HRV co- administration 
group minus HRV separate group) in the percentage of subjects with seroprotective titers (≥1:8) 
for  each  of  anti-poliovirus  serotypes  1,  2  and  3  antibodies  are  ≥  -10%  (clinical  limit  for  non-
inferiority).  
and 
Lower  limits  of  the  standardized  asymptotic  95%  CIs  on  the  differences  (HRV  co-administration 
group  minus  HRV  separate  group)  in  the  percentage  of  subjects  with  seroprotective 
concentrations (≥0.1 IU/mL) for each of anti-diphtheria and anti-tetanus antibodies are ≥ - 10% 
(clinical limit for non-inferiority).

Statistical Methods 
Analysis of Demography 
The distributions of subjects enrolled by center were tabulated by group. The number of subjects who 
dropped  out  at  Visit  6  was  tabulated  by  group  according  to  the  reason  for  drop-  out.  The  median, 
mean, range and standard deviation (SD) of age at each study vaccine dose (in weeks) were computed 
by group. The median, mean and SD of height in centimeter (cm) and weight in kilograms (kg) at Visit 
1 were computed by group. The Body Mass Index (BMI) at Visit 1 was also computed as weight (in kg) 
/ height2 (in meters). The median, mean and SD of the gestation period (in weeks) and weight at birth 
(in kg) were computed by group. The racial and gender composition were also presented. The number 
of  doses  of  HRV  vaccine,  Prevnar,  Pediarix  and  ActHIB  administered  was  tabulated  per  group.  The 
percentage of subjects who received a dose of hepatitis B vaccine before Dose 1 of routine vaccination 
at Visit 1 was tabulated per group. 
Analysis of Immunogenicity 
Within group analysis 
For each treatment group and each antigen: 
• 
• 
• 
Seropositivity/seroprotection rates, as applicable, were calculated with exact 95% CI 
GMC/geometric  mean  titers  (GMTs)  with  95%  CIs  were  tabulated.  Calculation  of  the  GMC/GMTs 
was performed by taking the anti-log of the mean of the log concentration/ titer transformations. 
Antibody  concentrations/  titers  below  the  cut-off  of  the  assay  were  given  an  arbitrary  value  of 
half the cut-off for the purpose of GMC/GMT calculation 
The distribution of antibody concentrations/ titers was presented using reverse cumulative curves 
(RCC).  For  anti-HBsAg  antibodies,  seroprotection  rates  and  GMC,  with  95%  CIs,  were  also 
computed according to whether subjects received a dose of hepatitis B vaccine or not before Dose 
1 of routine vaccination at Visit 1.

The 95% CIs of GMC/GMT ratios between groups (co-ad group divided by sep-ad group) were  
computed using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) model on the logarithm10 transformation of the 
concentrations/titers. The ANOVA model included the vaccine group as only fixed effect. For anti- 
HBsAg antibodies, the ANOVA included the previous hepatitis B vaccination status as an additional 
fixed effect 
The criteria for non-inferiority were only pre-specified for the response to routine vaccines 
Analysis of Safety 
Preliminary safety data on SAEs occurring in study  Rota-060 from study initiation up to the data lock 
point of 23 April 2007 and recorded in the GSK SAE database is provided as a tabular summary. SAEs 
reported in clinical studies are also recorded in the clinical study database. The GSK SAE database and 
the  clinical  study  database  will  undergo  a  final  reconciliation  upon  completion  of  the  Extended  Safety 
Follow-up Phase. 
  Results 
Demography 
The analysis was performed on the ATP Cohort for immunogenicity and on the TVC. 
The  demographic  profiles  of  the  two  groups  of  subjects  in  the  ATP  Cohort  for  immunogenicity  were 
comparable with respect to mean weight, mean height, gender and BMI at Visit 1. The mean age of the 
subjects in the co-ad group was 8.7 weeks at the time of the first dose of HRV vaccine and the routine 
infant vaccines and 17.4 weeks at the time of the second dose of HRV vaccine and the routine infant 
vaccines. The mean age of the subjects in the sep-ad group was 8.8 weeks at the time of the first dose 
of  the  routine  vaccination  and  17.6  weeks  at  the  time  of  the  second  dose  of  the  routine 
vaccination.The mean age of the subjects in the sep-ad group was 12.8 weeks at the time of the first 
dose  of  the  HRV  vaccine  and  21.5  weeks  at  the  time  of  the  second  dose  of  the  HRV  vaccine.  The 
demographic characteristics were similar for the ATP Cohort for immunogenicity and the TVC.

Safety results 
Preliminary Safety Results up to the data lock point of 23 April 2007 
No  deaths  were  reported  up  to  the  data  lock  point.  SAEs  were  reported  by  the  investigators  for  28 
subjects up to the data lock point of 23 April 2007. Of these, 10 SAEs were reported within the 31-day 
post-vaccination  period.  All  SAEs  reported  within  31  days  of  an  HRV  vaccine  dose  (either  co-
administered  or  given  separately  with  the  routine  infant  vaccines)  were  resolved.  One  subject  in  the 
sep-ad group withdrew due to an unrelated SAE (malignant brain neoplasm) from the Active Phase of 
the study. One case of intussusception was reported in study Rota-060 up to the data lock point of 23 
April 2007. A 39-week old female subject from the sep-ad group experienced intussusception 90 days 
after  the  third  dose  of  routine  vaccines.  The  intussusception  was  reduced  by  surgery.  The  event 
resolved after 6 days. 
Assessor’s  comment:  The final safety data was provided in the annex report of the Extended Safety 
Follow-up Phase. Please see further down this AR.

Conclusions: 
By  meeting  the  pre-specified  criteria  for  non-inferiority,  study  Rota-060  has  demonstrated  that 
co- administration of the HRV  vaccine  with licensed routine infant  vaccines recommended in the 
US (Pediarix, Prevnar and ActHIB) does not negatively impact the immune response to any of the 
antigens (PRP, HBsAg, poliovirus serotypes 1, 2 and 3, diphtheria, tetanus, PT, FHA, PRN and S. 
pneumoniae  serotypes  4,  6B,  9V,  14,  18C,  19F  and  23F)  that  are  currently  included  in  the 
Centers  for  Disease  Control  and  Prevention  is  schedule,  Advisory  Committee  on  Immunization 
Practices (ACIP), American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and in the American Academy of Family 
Physician  (AAFP)  schedules  of  recommended  immunizations  for  infants  in  the  US.  The  primary 
objective of this study was met.  
Two doses of the HRV vaccine (at least 106.0 CCID50 per dose) were immunogenic in US infants, 
with anti-rotavirus IgA seropositivity rates of 78.8% [95% CI: 71.8%; 84.8%] at 3 months after 
the 2nd HRV vaccine dose in the co-ad group and 86.0% [95% CI: 78.5%; 91.6%] at 2 months 
after the 2nd HRV vaccine dose in the sep-ad group.  
There are no clinical concerns raised based on the preliminary safety data from study Rota-060. 
Assessor’s  comment:  Study  107531  sought  to  investigate  the  potential  impact  of  Rotarix 
vaccination on the immunogenicity of routine infant vaccinations (as recommended in the US) 
when said vaccination was given concomitantly. The study design thus compromised two arms: 
one where HRV was given at the same time as the first two routine vaccinations and one were 
the two HRV administrations were done separately. 
Non-inferiority  between  the  both  study  arms  in  respect  to  immune  responses  to  the  routine 
vaccinations  was  attained,  and  neither  was  HRV  immunogenicity  impacted  due  to  co-
administration. 
Safety  was  to  be  assessed  in  a  prolonged  safety  follow-up  report,  but  preliminary  data 
gathered  in  this  trial  did  not  point  towards  worrisome  trends  or  issues  of  particular  interest. 
Only one case of intussusception, which  was dealt with by surgery, was reported in all of the 
groups. 
From this trial it can be gathered that co-administration of HRV with routine child vaccinations, 
as done in the US, has no appreciable impact on the immunogenicity of either of the vaccines.

The  percentage  of  subjects  who  took  at  least  one  concomitant  medication  by  type,  during  the 
active phase of the study was tabulated with exact 95% CI for each group. 
 Exploratory  comparisons  between  groups  for  the  percentage  of  subjects  reporting  specific  AEs  (any 
intensity,  related,  grade  3,  those  leading to  ER  visit  and  those  that  did  not  result  in  an  ER  visit)  and 
subjects reporting SAEs from Day 0 up to the last study contact of the extended safety follow-up were 
performed  using  two-sided  asymptotic  standardized  95%  CIs  for  group  difference  and  the  two-sided 
asymptotic score test for the null hypothesis of identical incidence in both groups (significance level of 
alpha = 0.05). 
P-values less than 0.05 were used as an aid to highlight potential imbalance between groups.  
  Results 
Demography 
The analysis was performed on the TVC, which included 484 subjects who received at least one dose of 
the study vaccines (Pediarix, Prevnar, ActHIB and HRV vaccine). Of these 484 subjects, 25 subjects in 
the sep-ad group dropped out before Visit 2 without having received any HRV vaccine. Hence, only 459 
subjects received at least one dose of the HRV vaccine.

specific AE incidences: 
• 
• 
The percentage of subjects with at least one specific AE from Day 0 up to the last study contact 
was similar in both groups (10.8% in the co-ad group and 12.8% in the sep-ad group) (p-value = 
0.512).  
A  potential  imbalance  between  groups  was  noted  for  only  one  specific  AE  ‘Gastroesophageal 
reflux’ (5 subjects (2.1%) in the sep-ad group and none in the co-ad group) (p-value = 0.021). 
None  of  the  cases  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  vaccination.  One  case

resulted  in  an  ER  visit.  None  of  the  subjects  had  a  prior  medical  history  of  ‘Gastroesophageal 
reflux’. This potential imbalance is likely due to a chance observation.  
The percentage of subjects with at least one specific AE leading to ER visit from Day 0 up to the 
last study contact was 8.4% in the co-ad group and 8.9% in the sep-ad group (p-value = 0.844).  
The percentage of subjects with at least one specific AE not leading to an ER visit from Day 0 up 
to the last study contact was 2.4% in the co-ad group and 4.7% in the sep-ad group (p-value = 
0.175)  
One subject in the sep-ad group reported a specific AE (pyrexia) that was assessed as related to 
vaccination. This subject experienced pyrexia one day after receiving the first dose of the routine 
infant vaccines. The duration of this AE was two days and the subject recovered.  
SAE incidences: 
• 
From Day 0 up to the last study contact, at least one SAE was reported by 15 (6.0%) subjects in 
the co-ad group and 14 (6.0%) subjects in the sep-ad group (p-value = 0.975).  
•  When SAEs were classified by MedDRA SOC and PT, no potential imbalance between groups were 
noted  for  any  of  the  SAEs  reported  during  the  entire  study  period  (p-value  >0.05  for  all 
comparisons).  
•  One subject in the co-ad group experienced rotavirus gastroenteritis 108 days after the third dose 
of  routine  infant  vaccines.  This  subject  was  hospitalized  and  laboratory  demonstrated  rotavirus 
antigen  in  stool  (serotype  not  investigated).  This  SAE  resolved  and  was  not  considered  by  the 
investigator to be causally related to vaccination.  
•  All subjects recovered from the SAEs except one subject in the sep-ad group with malignant brain 
neoplasm.  This  SAE  was  not  considered  to  be  causally  related  to  vaccination  by  the  investigator. 
This subject was withdrawn from the study before receiving any dose of the HRV vaccine.  
•  One case of intussusception was reported during the study. A 39-week old female subject (n° 92) 
from the sep-ad group experienced intussusception 90 days after the third dose of routine vaccines 
(125 days after the second dose of HRV vaccine). The intussusception was reduced by surgery. The 
event resolved after 6 days.  
•  One SAE (‘Fever’ with PT ‘Viral Infection’) was considered by the investigator to be causally related 
to vaccination. The subject in the co-ad group developed fever 9 days after receiving the first dose 
of  the  HRV  vaccine  co-administered  with  routine  infant  vaccines  and  was  hospitalized.  The  fever 
lasted for 3 days and the subject recovered.  
•  There were no fatal events reported in this study.

Withdrawals due to adverse events/serious adverse events: 
Withdrawals  due  to  AE/SAE  were  assessed  only  during  the  active  phase  of  the  study.  The 
parents/guardians of subject number 50 in the sep-ad group withdrew their child from the study after 
administration of the routine vaccinations at Visit 1 due to an unrelated SAE (atypical rhabdoid tumor). 
This  subject  did  not  receive  any  dose  of  the  HRV  vaccine.  This  SAE  was  not  considered  by  the 
investigator to be causally related to vaccination.

Conclusions: 
Two  doses  of  the  HRV  vaccine,  when  co-administered  with  licensed  routine  infant  vaccines 
recommended in the US (Pediarix, Prevnar and ActHIB) or given separately, have a similar safety 
profile. 
There are no clinical concerns raised based on the available safety data. 
Assessor’s  comment:  The  extended  safety  follow-up  of  Study  107531  included  all  patients 
whom  were  vaccinated  in  the  active  phase  of  the  study,  and  was  meant  to  investigate  the 
safety  of  HRV  vaccination  in  combination  with  routine  (US)  childhood  vaccinations,  whether 
administered concomitantly or separately. 
The  data  gathered  in  this  follow-up  showed  that  the  safety  profile  between  both  groups 
(concomitant  versus  separate  administration)  was  similar,  and  that  no  administration-specific 
safety signals were detectable. It is agreed with the MAH that none of the observations made 
in this safety follow-up are a reason for concern. 
III.  OVERALL DISCUSSION ON CLINICAL ASPECTS 
The four Rotarix studies (+ extended safety follow-up annex) submitted in the framework of the P45 
resolution aimed to a) compare the vaccine's immunogenicity and safety compared to placebo with or 
without  routine  pediatric  co-vaccines  in  children  aged  from  6  weeks  to  12  weeks  of  age  and  b) 
investigate  non-inferiority  and  non-negative-impact  bearing  of  concomitant  vaccination  with  OPV  and 
vaccines used within the US routine pediatric vaccination schedule. 
All study outcomes confirmed the good immunogenicity and safety profiles of the Rotarix vaccine in the 
study  populations,  and  it  was  clearly  established  that  concomitant  vaccination  within  the  routine 
pediatric vaccination schedule did not bring about any negative effects on these or the other vaccine's 
established immunogenicity and safety profiles. 
No  new  issues  that  would  warrant  regulatory  actions  were  found  to  exist  in  any  of  the  study  results 
provided, and results were in agreement with the already established knowledge on Rotarix safety and 
immunogenicity. 
This submission is thus hereby considered fulfilled.

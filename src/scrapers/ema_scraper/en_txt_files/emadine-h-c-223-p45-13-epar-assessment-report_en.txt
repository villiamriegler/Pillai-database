INTRODUCTION 
EMADINE  application  has  been  registered  in  1999  under  the  centralised  procedure  on  the 
basis that contained a new active substance, emedastine difumarate, a selective and topically 
effective histamine H1 antagonist developed for ophthalmic use in the symptomatic treatment 
of seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. 
Currently, the indication applies to adult patients as well as children older than 3 years with a 
recommended posolgy of two instillations per day. 
A  unpreserved  formulation  (without  benzalkonium  chloride  0.01%)  has  been  authorised  at  a 
later date as a line extension. 
A  paediatric  file  was  first  submitted  on  October  2008  and  then  completed  to  meet  EMEA 
request regarding additional paediatric data since the original EU registration of this product. 
Finally, the MAH (Alcon) has submitted on 6 May 2009 a short critical expert overview based 
on a literature review of 17 references discussing either the overall benefit/risk balance or/and 
the paediatric use of EMADINE 0.05%, eye drops solution, in accordance with Article 45 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended on medicinal products for paediatric use. 
Even  if  no  critical  view  of  the  MAH  was  expressed  in  the  first  submission  of  3  published 
studies making reference to a paediatric use with EMADINE (October 2008), the MAH clearly 
stated in the completed file submitted on 6 May 2009  that the additional paediatric data do not 
influence  the  benefit/risk  for  EMADINE  0.05%,  eye  drops  solution  and  that  there  is  no  a 
consequential regulatory action.  
Alcon does not consider that the prescribing information for this product needs to be amended 
in respect of paediatric use.  
According  to  the  MAH,  it  is  considered  that  the  available  data  support  the  continued  use  of 
emedastine difumarate 0.5 mg/ml eye drops in paediatric patients.

1.  Introduction 
Background 
In  the  original  file,  besides  a  traditional  clinical  development  plan  (environmental  study),  the 
Applicant  has  used  an  alternative  approach:  a  standardised  Conjunctival  Allergen  Challenge 
studies (CAC) as a “model” of clinical efficacy also known as the conjunctival provocation test 
(CPT).  In  the  CAC  model,  asymptomatic  allergic  patients  are  given  a  predetermined  topical 
dose of allergen to induce an allergic reaction under standardized conditions. 
Itching and redness were selected as primary efficacy criteria as they were representative of 
the most frequent and incapacitating symptom and sign of acute allergic conjunctivitis; these 
were assessed on  9 points scales [0-4]. 
The  environmental  trial  addressed  the  question  of  Emadine’s  efficacy  and  safety  in  a 
representative population using a treatment duration of six weeks which was considered as an 
acceptable duration for seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. 
Background on paediatric data submitted in the original file: 
According to the European Authorisation Emadine eye drops solution can be currently used in 
children  older  than  3  years  of  age.  Indeed,  although  only  a  limited  population  of  paediatric 
patients has been studied, this was considered to be useful information and was reflected in 
the  SPC  (section  4.2).  Based  on  the  following  paediatric  data,  results  indicated  that  the 
efficacy and safety profile of emedastine was similar for adult and paediatric patients. 
→Over  500  subjects/patients  were  randomised 
concentrations of emedastine, and over 320 of these were exposed to emedastine 0.05%.  
→The  safety  database  consisted  of  950  subjects/patients  exposed  to  various  concentrations 
of emedastine, and over 670 of these were exposed to emedastine 0.05%. 
→There were 97 children aged 3-16 years participating in the efficacy and safety studies.

No subject aged 3-16 years of age was discontinued due to an adverse event; no deaths were 
recorded  in  the  studies.  Overall,  the  pattern  of  adverse  events  was  similar  for  the  cohort  of 
children  and  adults  receiving  Emadine  (discomfort,  hyperaemia,  dryness,  corneal  staining, 
pruritus  were  most  important  ADRS  reported).  In  patients  aged  3-6  years,  ocular  discomfort 
was slightly higher and the most frequent (6.5%) related ocular adverse event as reported in

In accordance with Article 45 of the Regulation, the MAH submits an overview based on 
17 literature references.  
17 published reviews are provided among them 9 are not specifically related to Emadine (in 
two Emadine is never cited) but all are reviews on allergic diseases and usual cares 
recommended by practitioners and one presents a monography of Emadine. 
Most  of  these  articles  refer  to  either  a  global  view  of  ocular  allergic  diseases  or/  and  to  the 
wide  range  of  medications  available  to  control  their  symptoms  (presented  as  ocular  allergy 
guidelines). Classification of the different categories of ocular allergic diseases and their target 
population  are  reminded.  Classification,  advantages  or  disadvantages  of  each  category  of 
medications are discussed with regard to target populations.

It is reminded that seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis are the most common types of 
ocular allergies while atopic and vernal keratoconjunctivitis are less common but more severe 
forms of ocular allergy that may affect children.  
Based on these references Emadine (emedastine difumarate) is clearly classified as a potent 
second generation histamine H1 antagonist (non sedating).  
According to this literature review,  
- Topical treatments are preferred over systemic for isolated allergic eye disease because of 
their faster relief of ocular symptoms and limited systemic side effects. 
-  The  efficacy  of  emedastine  has  been  consistently  demonstrated  in  clinical  trials  comparing 
different  available  antihistamines  (levocabastine,  ketotifene)  nor  other  antiallergic  treatments 
as mast cells stabilising (nedocromil) or non steroidal anti-inflammatory agent (ketorolac) and 
placebo using in most cases the CAC model or a similar technique. 
These data add little to the knowledge regarding emedastine. 
Nevertheless, three studies are describing a paediatric use of Emadine, in addition to the data 
provided in the original file.  
The three references are listed below: 
-Comparaison  of  emedastine  0.05%  or  nedocromil  sodium  2%  eye  drops  and  placebo  in 
controlling local reactions in subjects with allergic conjunctivitis; V.Orfeo, European journal of 
ophthalmology, vol 12, N°4.2002/pp 262-265.

Original copies and certified translations (when needed) of these 3 published articles making 
reference to an additional paediatric experience of emedastine were provided by the MAH. 
These studies were not sponsored by the MAH. 
Among  these  references,  the  3  studies  described  below  provide  paediatric  experience  in 
addition to that previously provided in the original file.  
Additionally,  references  13&18  (Verin  Ph,  Easty  DL;  2001),  10  (Secchi  A,  Leonardi  A;  2000) 
and 11 (Secchi A, Ciprandi G; 2000) refer to the environmental study previously provided and 
assessed in the original registration file. According to the Author A. Secchi which publication 
(11)  had  for  purpose  to  discuss  more  in  depth  the  paediatric  use  of  Emadine  based  on  the 
cohort of 42 children from 4 to 16 years as included in the environmental study, emedastine is 
both  safe  and  efficacious  in  treating  SAC  in  a  six  week  environmental  study  of  paediatric 
subjects and is considered by the author in 2000 as an important new agent in the treatment 
of paediatric ocular allergy.

First Dr Endre L. study (n=20) 
  Description and Methods 
This  paediatric  Study  was  carried  out  between  August 27  and  October  26,  2001.  The  study 
took place during ragweed and Artemisia pollen season. 
  According to the Author, the study had a very limited goal that focused on the immediate 
effect  of  a  single  instillation  (one  drop)  of  emedastine  on  acute  seasonal  allergic 
conjunctivitis. 
  Study design 
Designed as a single dose study, one drop of Emadine 0.05% was instilled in the tested eye 
and the effect compared with the untreated controlateral eye used as control.   
  Study population /Sample size 
The patients’ population participating in the study consisted of 20 patients (12 boys and 
8  girls)  from  6  to  21 years  (average  12.3  years)  suffering  from  acute  seasonal  allergic 
conjunctivitis.  All  were  at  least  hypersensitive  to  ragweed  and  Artemisia  pollen.  All  had  an 
allergic  cold,  and  had  received  eye  drops  containing  an  antihistamine,  because  they  all  had 
eye symptoms. 
  Treatments 
Each patient received one drop of emedastine in one eye, and no treatment in the other eye. 
  Outcomes/endpoints 
The  severity  of  ocular  itching  and  the  grade  of  ocular  redness/hyperemia  were  scored  on 
scales ranging from 0 to 4, most severe symptoms: 
Itching sensation was assessed by the patient: 0 (absence) to 4 (extremely serious itching).

Palpebral  and  bulbar  conjunctival  hyperemia  (redness)  was  assessed  by  the  physician:  0 
(normal) to 4 (dark red with petechiae).  
Assessment of the immediate effect of Emadine was objectified by examination done every 2 
minutes after instillation of the drop. The time for a significant improvement was recorded for 
each criterion.  
Regarding safety, patients were asked to report any uncomfortable sensation. 
  Statistical Methods 
Not described 
  Results 
  Recruitment/ Number analysed; Baseline data; Efficacy results 
Itching  was  statistically  significantly  reduced  from  2.85  ±  0.75  points  (baseline  score  for 
treated eye) to 0.45 ± 0.51 points on average in less than 3 min (corresponding to a difference 
of -2.40), with 50% of the children reporting that the itching sensation completely stopped in 2-
3 min. 
Redness was statistically significantly improved,  from 2.35 ± 0.59 (baseline score for treated 
eye) to 0.55 ± 0.51 points in 7.7min on average (corresponding to a difference of -1.80).  
The  author  reported  that  no  change  was  observed  over  20 min  in  the  untreated  control  eye. 
Nevertheless,  baseline  and  final  values  corresponding  to  untreated  eyes  are  not  reported  in 
the publication. 
  Safety results 
One boy, 11 years old, reported an undesired side effect (burning sensation). 
Assessor’s conclusion 
Results  of  this  single  dose  study  suggested  that  Emadine  eye  drops  might  rapidly  and 
effectively reduce itching and conjunctival hyperemia in paediatrics.  
These non randomised 20 children do not bring any additional relevant information regarding 
paediatric efficacy or safety. Burning sensation is currently listed in the SPC.

  Description and Methods 
 
Objective(s) 
The  objective  was  to  investigate  the  long  term  effectiveness  and  side  effects  of  a  treatment 
with Emadine in paediatric patients. 
 
Study design 
The study was carried out according to an uncontrolled open label design.

232  children  suffering  from  allergy  to  grass  and/or  ragweed  pollen  received  Emadine  eye 
drops  as  treatment  for  their  eye  symptoms  during  two  pollen  seasons  between  2004  and 
2005.  
 
Treatments 
According  to  the  Author  since  Emadine  was  also  suitable  for  continual  treatment  lasting 
several months, all patients paediatric patients received Emadine eye drops (nevertheless, the 
centralised  EU  agreement  is  currently  restricted  to  seasonal  allergic  conjunctivitis  (SAC),  as 
the  pivotal  study  was  limited  to  six  weeks  duration  and  CAC  studies  were  of  very  limited 
duration). 
Anyway, during this study, none of the 232 patients used Emadine eye drops continually but 
only in case of symptoms and for at least 3-5 days. 
 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Assessment  of  long  term  efficacy  was  searched  throughout  the  study  treatment  period  by 
asking patients on their end of treatment ocular condition.  
  Results 
 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
The average age of the 138 boys was 11.1 years (3 to 16), and the average age of the 94 girls 
was 11.3 years (3 to 16). 
Among  the  selected  patients,  only  two  had  allergic  conjunctivitis  alone;  all  of  the  rest  of 
children  also  suffered  from  rhinitis  and/or  asthma.  Consequently,  they  received  appropriate 
treatment  for  this  (those  with  rhinitis  took  2nd-generation  antihistamines,  some  also  took  a 
steroid nose spray; the asthmatics took a steroid or a steroid combined with inhaling a long-
lasting bronchodilator).  
 
Baseline data 
Not provided 
 
Efficacy results 
The efficacy assessment is totally biased as there is no control and as patients had additional 
treatments for asthma or rhinitis (namely corticoids and/or antihistamines which may influence 
the evolution of ocular allergic conjunctivitis). According to patients’ responses, Emadine eye 
drops did not lose their effectiveness during the course of the two pollen seasons. 
 
Safety results 
In  this  study,  of  the  232  children  participating  in  the  "continued"  treatment,  none  had  to 
discontinue Emadine treatment because of some uncomfortable side effect. According to the 
author,  no  side  effect  was  reported  that  could  be  connected  with  administration  of  the  eye 
drops. 
Assessor’s Conclusion 
The  objectives  of  this  study  appear  unclear.  Nevertheless,  this  study  did  not  raise  any 
additional safety concern in paediatric patients.

  Description 
Comparison  of  emedastine  0.05%  or  nedocromil  sodium  2%  eye  drops  (in  one  eye)  and 
placebo (in the other eye) in controlling local reactions in subjects with allergic conjunctivitis. 
 V.  Orfeo,  Clinica  Mediterranea,  ophthalmology  unit,  Napoli  –  Italy-  European  journal  of 
ophthalmology/vol.12n°4.2002 / pp 262-266. 
  Methods 
 
The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of nedocromil sodium 2% 
eye drops (mast cell stabilizer) as compared  to emedastine 0.05% eye drops (Histamine H1 
antagonist)  in  producing  immediate  relief  of  ocular  allergic  reaction  previously  induced  by  a 
predetermined  and  standardized  topical  ocular  dose  of  allergen  (conjunctival  allergen 
challenge CAC / conjunctival provocation test CPT) 
 
Designed  as  double-blind,  randomised,  cross-over  and  placebo-controlled,  this  study 
was  conducted  according  to  the  CAC  model.  This  pharmacodynamic  model  was  discussed 
and  accepted  (Scientific  advice  for  Emadine)  as  a  relevant  model  to  evaluate  allergic 
conjunctivitis in standardised and reproducible conditions (i.e. creation of well defined disease 
condition  (onset  and  duration  of  treatment  on  selected  efficacy  parameters),  homogeneous 
population,  definite  dose  and  category  of  allergen)  provided  that  it  was  fully  validated  by 
clinical data.   
 
Study population /Sample size 
30 subjects with a personal history of allergic conjunctivitis were selected, enrolled and tested 
according to CAC conditions. 
No information regarding inclusion criteria are provided for number or age of patients. 
Treatments 
 
At the second visit, subjects were randomly treated with 2 drops of emedastine or nedocromil 
in one eye and 2 drops of placebo in the controlateral eye. After 5 mn the offending allergen 
was instilled in both eyes according to current CAC procedure.  
After  one  week  the  whole  procedure  was  repeated  (visit  3)  using  again  the  placebo  in  the 
control eye and the trial medication that was not administered at visit 2, in the other eye. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
 
The intensity of the allergic reaction was evaluated 3, 10 and 20 mn after allergen instillation, 
by rating scores on a 9 points scale: (sign and symptom) 
Itching (0 none, 4 incapacitating itch)  
- 
-  Redness (0 none, 4 very severe) 
Statistical Methods 
 
Statistical  analysis  was  done  using  Student’s  t-test  with  a  conservative  alpha  value  0.01 
(multiple comparisons).

Recruitment/ Number analysed 
This remains unknown for paediatric subjects. 
The overall population of the study included 30 subjects; 19 subjects were males and 11 were 
females.  The  mean  age  of  the  selected  population  was  22  years  (range  7-38).  Except  for 
lower border age (7 years) no information is available regarding the number of paediatrics and 
the pattern of age. Since no analysis of efficacy or safety results is provided in this literature 
reference  for  paediatrics,  no  relevant  conclusion  in  connection  with  the  subject  of  this 
paediatric assessment can be drawn from the presented data.

Baseline data 
This remains unknown for paediatric subjects. 
 
Efficacy results 
This remains unknown for paediatric subjects. 
In the whole population tested, emedastine 0.05% and nedocromil sodium 2% eye drops are 
both more effective than placebo in relieving ocular itching and in reducing ocular redness, 3, 
10 and 20 minutes after instillation of allergen (p<0.01).  
Emedastine  0.05%  was  statistically  significantly  (p<0.01)  more  effective  than  nedocromil  2% 
for redness (3, 10 and 20 minutes after instillation of allergen); similar results are observed for 
itching at 3 and 10 minutes but  just as effective as nedocromil at 20 minutes. 
Safety results 
 
These remain unknown for paediatric subjects. 
Nevertheless,  no  adverse  reactions  were  reported  in  this  study  for  either  emedastine  or 
nedocromil. 
Assessor’s Conclusion 
Indeed, this study do not raise any additional safety concern in tested patients but the cohort 
of  paediatric  patients  is  not  identified  and  therefore  not  analysed  separately.  Finally  it 
impossible to conclude about a paediatric efficacy as the number and age of children included 
is  unknown  in  this  double-blind,  randomised,  cross-over  and  placebo-controlled,  study 
conducted according to the CAC model. 
2.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Additional paediatric data submitted by the Applicant are scarce and do not add any relevant 
efficacy  information  to  the  previous  original  file  regarding  paediatric  use.  Nevertheless,  no 
additional paediatric safety concern is highlighted from these data.

RAPPORTEUR’S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND 
RECOMMENDATION 
 
Overall conclusion 
Due  to  poor  design,  the  additional  single  dose  non  randomised  study  (20  children)  or  open 
label uncontrolled study (232 children including 230 children who had concomitant interfering 
treatments  for  asthma  or  rhinitis)  cannot  bring  any  relevant  efficacy  data  regarding  use  in 
children suffering from seasonal allergic conjunctivitis. In the other hand, even if the third study

 10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
provides a comparison of emedastine vs nedocromil vs placebo that includes 30 subjects from 
7  to  38  years  of  ages,  no  conclusion  can  be  raised  from  these  data  as  the  number  and  the 
range of age regarding the children cohort is lacking.  
No unexpected additional paediatric safety concern is reported in these studies.  
 
Recommendation  
According to the current SPC, EMADINE may be used in paediatric patients (3 years of age 
and older) at the same posology as in adults. 
According to Article 45, the Applicant has submitted 3 additional studies including paediatrics 
that  are  of  limited  interest  for  a  paediatric  use  as  highlighted  above.  Nevertheless  no  safety 
concern was raised by these experiences. Only one adverse event was recorded. This is listed 
in  the  SPC.  In  the  other  hand  the  efficacy  in  paediatric  patients  is  not  challenged  by  these 
additional data.  
No  changes  in  the  current  SPC  are  required  regarding  paediatric  use  on  the  basis  of  these 
additional paediatric data submitted by the MAH.

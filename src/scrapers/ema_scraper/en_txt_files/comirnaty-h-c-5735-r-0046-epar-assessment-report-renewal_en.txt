1.  Background information on the annual renewal 
The European Commission issued on 21 December 2020, a conditional marketing authorisation (MA) 
for Comirnaty. This implied that, pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Article 5 
of Commission Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) has to 
complete ongoing studies, or to conduct new studies, as listed in Annex II.E of the MA, the so-called 
Specific Obligations (SOBs). These data form the basis of the renewal of the conditional MA. 
A conditional MA is valid for one year and may be renewed annually upon request by the MAH. 
Therefore, pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and Article 6(2) of Commission 
Regulation (EC) No 507/2006, the MAH BioNTech Manufacturing GmbH, submitted to the Agency on 18 
June 2021 an application for renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation for Comirnaty. The 
expiry date of the MA is 21 December 2021. 
The period covered by this annual renewal is 21 December 2020 to 29 April 2021.

SOB 1: Quality: Characterisation 
The due date for this SOB was July 2021 and a variation application EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0056/G is 
under assessment. An interim report was submitted within a PAM-ANX procedure in March 2021 and 
monthly status reports submitted in January, February and May 2021.  
SOB 2: Quality: Control strategy 
The due date for this SOB was July 2021 and a variation application EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0056/G is 
under assessment. An interim report was submitted within a PAM-ANX procedure in March 2021 and 
monthly status reports submitted in January, February and May 2021.  
SOB 4: Quality: Process and control strategy for the excipient ALC-0315 
The due date for this SOB was July 2021 and a variation application EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0054/G is 
under assessment. Interim reports were submitted in January and April 2021. 
SOB 5: Quality: Process and control strategy for the excipient ALC-0159 
The due date for this SOB was July 2021 and a variation application EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0054/G is 
under assessment. Interim reports were submitted in January and April 2021. 
SOB 6: Clinical  
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of Comirnaty, the MAH should submit the final Clinical Study 
Report for the randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind study C4591001.  
Interim results from study C4591001 were included in the initial Marketing Authorisation Application 
for Comirnaty, and the study design and results were extensively assessed during the approval 
procedure. The study is still ongoing according to plan, and final results are expected in December 
2023.  
CHMP comment: 
Specific Obligations 1,2, 4, 5 and 6 are ongoing and progressing according to plan.  
The CHMP issued an opinion on the 20th of May 2021 concluding that Specific Obligation 003 had been 
fulfilled, and therefore deleted from the Annex II.  
2.3.  Overall conclusion on Specific Obligations 
During the period covered by this annual renewal, several aspects for all quality SOBs have been 
addressed.  
SOB 004 and SOB 005 relating to the novel excipients are partially fulfilled. The data to fulfil the 
remaining parts of these SOBs have been submitted in variation EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0054/G and are 
currently under assessment by the CHMP. A Request for Further Information has been adopted on 14 
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/596333/2021 
Page 11/43 
 
 
 
 
 
October 2021.  
Similarly, data to fulfil SOB 001 (characterisation) and SOB 002 (control strategy & specifications) 
have been submitted in variation EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0056/G and are currently under assessment by 
the CHMP. A Request for Further Information has been adopted on 14 October 2021.  
Therefore, overall SOB 001, SOB 002, SOB 004 and SOB 005 are not fulfilled at the time point of the 
present assessment report; nevertheless, the MAH has been compliant in providing the data in 
response to these SOBs in line with the imposed deadlines, and therefore, the overall status of 
compliance is satisfactory.  
Regarding SOB003: In order to confirm the consistency of the finished product manufacturing process, 
the MAH should provide additional validation data, the due date for this SOB was March 2021 and the 
SOB was fulfilled with the variation EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0023/G (approved on 20 May 2021).  
During the period covered by this annual renewal interim data on the clinical SOB 006 have been 
submitted that overall are compliant in terms of adherence to deadlines and in terms of acceptability of 
data submitted. The available clinical evidence includes a tolerable safety profile and high vaccine 
efficacy against COVID-19 in individuals ≥12 years of age. 
3.  Additional scientific data provided relevant for the 
assessment of the benefit/risk balance 
3.1.  Quality 
For several of the remaining Quality SOBs the due date was July 2021 and variations 
EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0054/G and EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0056/G are currently under assessment.  
3.2.  Clinical efficacy 
Since approval of Comirnaty the MAH has submitted efficacy and safety data for children 12-15 years 
of age, and approval of an indication in this age group was obtained on May 31, 2021. 
(EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0030). For further details on the efficacy of Comirnaty, please see the initial 
marketing authorisation approval.  
3.3.  Clinical safety 
The MAH submitted the Addendum to the Clinical Overview (ACO), covering the period from 21 
December 2020 until 29 April 2021.  
Worldwide Marketing Authorisation Status 
BNT162b2 received a first temporary authorisation for emergency supply under regulation 174 in the 
UK on 1 December 2020 and in EEA countries on 21 December 2021. Up to the DLP (29 April 2021), it 
is currently conditionally approved in 42 countries (including EEA).

different vaccination sites in the country; overall 26 vials 
with leakages and/or loose caps were reported. All vials 
were from 1 batch, the only batch in use for vaccination in 
Hong Kong and Macau. During the investigation, it became 
apparent that the root cause of the reported product 
quality complaints is a combination of the container 
closure process (crimping) at 1 single CMO and of the 
specific transport conditions on dry ice that are required 
for BNT162b2. Vaccination in Hong Kong and Macau was 
stopped as soon as the issue became apparent (24 March 
2021). A total of 2 batches have been affected (including 
the one being used and another one already shipped to 
Hong Kong, but still in storage) and were quarantined. The 
root cause of the reported product quality complaints was 
clearly identified through analysis of the data generated 
and collected as of 31 March 2021. According to the data, 
the crimping process used for batches at the CMO fill and 
finish site requires optimization to ensure the container 
integrity during storage and shipment with dry ice. Under 
the ultra-cold conditions created by storing and shipping 
on dry ice, the stopper loses flexibility and, if not optimally 
crimped, allows the ingress of ambient gas into the vial. 
During thawing the flexibility of the stopper is regained 
and the stopper reseals the vial. This can result in 
increased pressure in the vial and presence of elevated 
CO2 levels. Due to the identified root cause the MAH could 
exclude any influence on batches that are on the market 
anywhere outside of Hong Kong and Macau. The CMO in 
question has not manufactured any batch that was 
released for any market other than Hong Kong and Macau. 
Vaccinations in Hong Kong and Macau were resumed with 
a vaccine batch from a different CMO on 3 April 2021; 
discussions to address the issue and resume supplies with 
the previous CMO are ongoing, no batches from this CMO 
are currently distributed.

The MAH also reported that after the DLP of this ACO, the CDS has been further updated (CDS ver. 
4.0 dated 19 May 2021) with the following: 
- 
- 
a warning on stress-related responses associated with the process of vaccination was added in 
section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use  
data from studies in section 4.8 Undesirable effects was updated to add available data in 12 to 
15-year-old subjects and in stable HIV-infected subjects 
-  Decreased appetite, Lethargy, Hyperhidrosis, Night sweating and Asthenia were added as 
Adverse Drug Reactions in section 4.8 Undesirable effects. 
Respectively on 5 May 2021, on 10 May 2021 and on 28 May 2021, BNT162b2 was authorized for use 
in individuals 12 years of age and older in Canada, in US and in Japan.   
Variation 0030 (EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0030) was also submitted to EMA on 30 April 2021 to seek 
expansion of the indication to subjects 12 to 15 years of age; on 28 May 2021, EMA CHMP 
recommended granting the extension of indication for use in children aged 12-15 years and the 
European Commission adopted a decision accordingly on 31 May 2021. 
PRAC comment: 
The SmPC is in line with the core data sheet (CDS).  
Furthermore, the CHMP adopted an Opinion on the 16th September 2021 to add asthenia, lethargy, 
decreased appetite, hyperhidrosis, and night sweats as side effects to the product information. In 
addition, following the PRAC meeting in July, myocarditis and pericarditis were added to sections 4.4. 
and 4.8 of the SmPC, and the package leaflet was updated accordingly. 
Patient exposure 
Clinical studies 
Cumulatively up to 21 April 2021, the MAH estimated that 49,315 subjects have participated in the 
Pfizer-managed studies of the COVID-19 vaccine clinical development program: 195 subjects received 
BNT162b1 (modRNA which encodes a secreted trimerized SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain); 
41,368 subjects received BNT162b2 (modRNA which encodes a membrane-anchored SARS-CoV-2 full-
length spike) of which, 20,291 subjects, who had received Placebo, were offered BNT162b2 post-
unblinding and 758 subjects received BNT162b2 and the Blinded boost; 329 received BNT162S017, 
6,370 subjects received blinded-therapy; and 1,053 subjects received placebo. 
Additionally, 1,691 subjects have participated in 2 studies managed by BioNTech (BNT162-01 and 
BNT162-04) and in 2 studies (BNT162-03 and BNT162-06) managed by Shanghai Fosun 
Pharmaceutical in China. 
PRAC comment: 
The MAH was requested to explain what “BNT162S017” is, compared to BNT162b1 and BNT162b2.

No clinical trials were completed up to 21 April 2021. 
Ongoing2 Clinical Trials 
There were 10 ongoing clinical trials up to 21 April 2021 (sponsored by BioNTech SE), out of which 2 
studies (BNT162-03 and BNT162-04) for study vaccines BNT162b1 and BNT162b3.  
Six studies were conducted by Pfizer: C4591001, C4591005, C4591007, C4591015, C4591017, 
C4591020. 
Four studies were conducted by BioNTech, including 2 studies in China managed by Shanghai Fosun 
Pharmaceutical Development (BNT162-03 and BNT162-06).   
Clinically important emerging efficacy and/or safety findings were identified for Study 
C4591001/BNT162-023 and C4591005 and are summarized below. 
• 
Study C4591001/BNT162-02  
Title: A Phase 1/2/3, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized, Observer-Blind, Dose-Finding Study to Evaluate 
the Safety, Tolerability, Immunogenicity, and Efficacy of SARS-COV-2 RNA Vaccine Candidates Against 
COVID-19 in Healthy Individuals   
Countries: Argentina, Brazil, Germany, South Africa, Turkey, US  
This study is a Specific Obligation in the context of BNT162b2’s conditional marketing authorisation 
and it is being conducted in order to confirm the efficacy and safety of the vaccine; the MAH should 
submit the final Clinical Study Report, including a 2-year follow up of the studied population. 
Study C4591001/BNT162-02 is an ongoing, randomized, placebo-controlled, observer-blind, dose-
finding Phase 1/2/3 registration study evaluating the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and efficacy 
of SARS-CoV-2 RNA vaccine candidates against COVID-19 in healthy individuals.  
Study C4591001/BNT162-02 was started as a Phase 1/2 study in adults in the US and was then 
amended to expand the study to a global Phase 2/3 study to accrue sufficient COVID-19 cases to 
conduct an efficacy assessment. The protocol was initiated in adults 18 years of age and older and 
subsequently amended to include adolescents as young as 12 years of age. The study has 
1 Collected since 01 December 2021, the date of the first temporary authorisation for emergency supply under regulation 
174 in the UK. 
2 Includes ongoing studies as well as studies in which patient enrolment and follow-up have been completed, but the 
analysis and CSR are in-progress. 
3 Pfizer-conducted clinical trial C4591001/BNT162-02 has an interim study report that is available upon request.

enrolled approximately 46,000 participants, including 2,260 young adolescents 12 to 15 years of 
age. Data from the Phase 1 part of the study was the basis for selection of the vaccine candidate and 
dose level for Phase 2/3. The Phase 2/3 part of the study evaluated the safety, immunogenicity, and 
efficacy of the selected vaccine candidate, BNT162b2, and is intended to support licensure globally.  
The available clinical evidence for BNT162b2 includes a tolerable safety profile and high VE against 
COVID-19 in individuals ≥12 years of age.  
The potential risks are based on the observed safety profile to date, which shows mostly mild to 
moderate reactogenicity, an acceptable incidence of severe or serious events, and no clinically 
concerning safety observations. The vaccine appears to be safe and well tolerated across the safety 
population and within demographic subgroups based on age, sex, race/ethnicity, country, and baseline 
SARS-CoV-2 status. The preponderance of severe cases of COVID-19, as defined by the FDA Guidance 
for Industry (June 2020)4, in the placebo group relative to the BNT162b2 group (9 of 10) suggests no 
evidence of vaccine-associated enhanced disease.  
Vaccine efficacy was ≥95% for participants without prior evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection and >94% 
for those irrespective of prior infections. Observed VE was >93% when data were stratified by age, 
sex, race/ethnicity, and country with the exception of the “all others” race group (89.3% VE) and 
Brazil (87.7% VE).  
Severe cases evaluated for efficacy were confined predominantly to the placebo group; only 1 severe 
case was reported in the BNT162b2 group in the final analysis. The efficacy data suggest high 
efficacy against COVID-19 in a broad population of individuals.

Title: A Phase 1/2, Placebo-Controlled, Randomized, and Observer-Blind Study to Evaluate the Safety, 
Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of a SARS-CoV-2 RNA Vaccine Candidate Against Covid-19 In Healthy 
Japanese Adults  
Country: Japan  
Study C4591005 is a Phase 1/2, randomized, placebo-controlled, and observer-blind study in healthy 
Japanese adults. The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the SARS-CoV-
2 mRNA vaccine candidate (BNT162b2) against COVID-19 administered as two 30-µg doses, 21 days 
apart, in Japanese adults 20 to 85 years of age.  
Clinical laboratory tests were performed for the first 24 participants (12 participants 20 to 64 years of 
age and 12 participants 65 to 85 years of age) (clinical laboratory subset). Local reactions (redness, 
swelling, and pain at the injection site), systemic events (fever, vomiting, diarrhoea, headache, 
fatigue, chills, new or worsened muscle pain, and new or worsened joint pain), and use of antipyretic 
medication were collected by all participants in an e-diary from Day 1 through Day 7 after each 
administration of study intervention. AEs were collected from the time the participant provided 
informed consent through 1 month after Dose 2. SAEs will be collected from the signing of the ICD to 
approximately 12 months after Dose 2.   
In this study, 160 Japanese participants (including 130 participants 20 to 64 years of age [younger age 
group] and 30 participants 65 to 85 years of age [older age group]) were randomized in an 
approximate 3:1 ratio of BNT162b2 to placebo. Interim data show BNT162b2 was well tolerated, with 
local reactions and systemic events mostly mild or moderate in severity, and no immediate AEs within 
30 minutes reported. An acceptable safety profile was observed in both younger and older Japanese 
adults with no SAEs reported through 1 month after Dose 2. Immune responses elicited 
by BNT162b2 were robust 1 month after Dose 2, consistent with data from the global program. These

encouraging results led to the marketing authorization of BNT162b2 in Japan. This study has since 
been converted to a post-marketing study. 
PRAC comment: 
This small study does not add to the current knowledge on the safety profile of Comirnaty.

observed during the follow-up period will be collected, and the long-term safety of this 
product will be assessed (to be conducted as 11-month follow-up investigation after 
completion of Investigation of Health Status of Recipients Vaccinated First). 
According to the MAH, there was no new safety information reported regarding these ongoing non-
interventional studies. 
PRAC comment: 
Within the first interim report of the PASS study C4591012, which is listed in the RMP of Comirnaty, 
(procedure EMEA/H/C/005735/MEA/010), only demographic and clinical characteristics of the two 
cohorts (Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine recipients and seasonal influenza vaccines recipients) were 
provided. No safety information was provided in the first interim report of study C4591012. Studies 
C4591008 and C4591006 are not part of the EU RMP. 
Medication Errors 
During the reporting interval, there were no serious clinical trial cases contained in the Global safety 
database that reported medication errors. 
From post-authorisation sources, 4,591 cases potentially indicative of medication errors were retrieved 
from the global safety database worldwide up to 29 April 2021. Upon review, 447 cases were 
determined to be non-contributory and are not included in the discussion for the following reasons: 
•  Off-label use or misuse rather than medication error was reported in 95 cases; 
•  Questions about the scheduling of the 2 doses of BNT162b2 and/or information that the second 
dose may be administered (but it was not administered yet at the time of reporting) or was 
scheduled outside the prescribed dosing window were reported in 169 cases; 
•  No error or intercepted/potential error with BNT162b2 were identified in 183 cases, including 
55 cases where the callers asked for information other than the scheduling of the 2 doses of 
BNT162b2. 
Among the 4,144 relevant medication error cases, the following scenarios, were described: 
•  Medication errors associated with harm [i.e., resulting in adverse reaction(s)] were reported in 
154 cases (3.7% of relevant medication error cases); 
•  Medication errors without harm [i.e. not resulting in adverse reaction(s)] were reported in 
3,814 cases (92.0% of relevant medication error cases), of which 2,043 cases involved co-
reported AEs; 
• 
• 
Potential medication errors were reported in 172 cases (4.1% of relevant medication error 
cases). 
Intercepted medication errors were reported in 4 cases (0.1% of relevant medication error 
cases). 
The analysis of the relevant cases indicative of medication error did not lead to any change in the RSI 
with regard to the instructions for preparation, administration or storage of BNT162b2.

No new safety signal was identified from the cases reporting medication errors. 
Medication errors are also analysed in the MSSRs for Comirnaty. From the MSSR assessments covering 
the period from 21 December 2020 to 29 April 2021, no safety issues were identified that required 
mitigation activity.  
The MAH stated that further analysis of cases indicative of medication errors will be provided in the 
PSUR with DLP of 18 June 2021. This is accepted. 
Non-clinical Data 
No new non-clinical safety findings were identified in the period from 21 December 2020 to 21 April 
2021.  
Literature 
Nonclinical (Published) 
According to the MAH, a search of the Medline and Embase databases did not identify non-clinical 
studies that presented important new safety findings for Comirnaty up to 21 April 2021.   
Clinical (Published) 
From a search of the Medline and Embase databases up to 21 April 2021, the MAH identified 4 clinical 
trials that presented important new safety/efficacy findings for Comirnaty when administered in at risk 
patients (i.e., patients on haemodialysis) or special population, including elderly and pregnant/lactating 
women.  The abstracts are presented in table 3 below.

Patients Undergoing Maintenance Hemodialysis. Clin J Am Soc Nephrol. 2021. doi: 
10.2215/CJN.03500321. 
Background and objectives: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with higher 
morbidity and mortality in patients on maintenance hemodialysis. Patients on dialysis tend to have a 
reduced immune response to infection or vaccination. We aimed to assess, for the first time to the 
best of our knowledge, the humoral response following vaccination with the BNT162b2 vaccine in 
patients on maintenance hemodialysis and the factors associated with it. 
Design, setting, participants, & measurements: The study included 56 patients on maintenance 
hemodialysis (dialysis group) and a control group composed of 95 health care workers. All 
participants had received two doses of the BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine. The serology testing 
was done using Quant II IgG anti-Spike severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-
CoV-2) assay by Abbott a median of 30 days after receipt of the second dose of the vaccine. 
Results: All subjects in the control group developed an antibody response compared with 96% (54 
of 56) positive responders in the dialysis group. The IgG levels in the dialysis group (median, 2900; 
interquartile range, 1128–5651) were significantly lower than in the control group (median, 7401; 
interquartile range, 3687–15,471). A Mann–Whitney U test indicated that this difference was 
statistically significant (U=1238; P<0.001). There was a significant inverse correlation of age and 
IgG levels in both groups. The odds of being in the lower quartile were significantly higher for older 
individuals (odds ratio, 1.11 per year of age; 95% confidence interval, 1.08 to 1.20; P=0.004) and 
for the dialysis group compared with the control group (odds ratio, 2.7; 95% confidence interval, 
1.13 to 7.51; P=0.05). Within the dialysis group, older age and lower lymphocyte count were 
associated with antibody response in the lower quartile (odds ratio, 1.22 per 1-year older; 95%

Conclusions: Although most patients on maintenance hemodialysis developed a substantial humoral 
response following the BNT162b2 vaccine, it was significantly lower than controls. Age was an 
important factor in the humoral response, regardless of chronic medical conditions.

The BNT162b2 mRNA COVID-19 vaccine showed high efficacy in clinical trials but observational data 
from populations not included in trials are needed. We describe immunogenicity 21 days post-dose 1 
among 514 Israeli healthcare workers by age, ethnicity, sex and prior COVID-19 infection. 
Immunogenicity was similar by ethnicity and sex but decreased with age. Those with prior infection 
had antibody titres one magnitude order higher than naïve individuals regardless of the presence of 
detectable IgG antibodies pre-vaccination.

Maternal and cord blood sera were collected from 20 parturients who received the BNT162b2 
vaccine. All women and infants were positive for anti S- and anti-RBD-specific IgG. Cord blood 
antibody concentrations were correlated to maternal levels and to time since vaccination. Antenatal 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may provide maternal and neonatal protection.

10.1016/j.ajog.2021.03.031. 
Objective: In December 2020, 2 lipid nanoparticle-formulated, nucleoside-modified messenger 
RNA–based vaccines received emergency use authorization by the US Food and Drug Administration, 
after their trials demonstrated 94% to 95% efficacy in preventing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-
19). Although no lactating people were included in the vaccine trials, national organizations support 
vaccination of this population, suggesting potential infant protection by passive transfer of maternal 
antibodies. The authors sought to characterize breast milk levels of anti–severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in lactating people undergoing COVID-19 
vaccination. 
Study Design: Participants were prospectively recruited during phase IA rollout of the COVID-19 
vaccine at a tertiary care center, after institutional review board approval. Inclusion criteria included 
lactation and planned vaccination with the Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccine. After obtaining 
informed consent, participants provided frozen breast milk samples at the following time points of 
vaccination: before, within the first 24 hours, and the following week. Samples were assessed for 
SARS-CoV-2 RNA by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and antispike immunoglobulin 
(Ig) G and IgA by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 
Results: A total of 5 subjects and 29 human milk samples were included in the analysis. All 
prevaccine milk samples tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 RNA, as defined by the cycle threshold 
value of >40 for the N1 target. Antispike IgG and IgA levels were significantly elevated relative to 
the prevaccine baseline at all time points. Antispike protein IgG remained sustained at a significant 
elevation beginning at 20 days after the first dose compared with the prevaccine baseline (P=.0061), 
through the final milk sample (day 30–39 P=.0095, >40 days P=.0040. Levels of antispike protein 
IgA were significantly elevated from baseline, starting 2 weeks after the first dose (P=.0286) 
through to the final sample (day 20–29 P=.0121, day 30–39 P=.0095, >40 days P=.0040); 
however, individual level data suggest a possible gradual decline in antispike IgA in human milk over 
time after the second dose.

Conclusion. The Authors characterized longitudinal breast milk levels of antispike IgG/A following 
Pfizer-BioNTech BNT162b2 vaccination, demonstrating sustained elevation of IgG/IgA levels. This 
response is similar to previous studies on maternal vaccination, which have shown high levels of 
breast milk IgA/G production for up to 6 months after vaccination for influenza and pertussis. A 
concurrent decrease in infant respiratory illness rates suggest that maternal vaccination confers 
protection against infection in breastfed infants. Thus, the Pfizer-BioNTech/BNT162b2 vaccination 
may also confer protection against COVID-19 to breastfed infants as well. Our study is limited by a 
small number of participants, but we report data that suggest a potential immune benefit to infants 
of lactating people up to 80 days after COVID-19 vaccination. Further studies are needed to 
characterize the length of antibody production in breast milk and the effect on infant infection rates 
after maternal COVID-19 vaccination. 
PRAC comment: 
It is agreed with the authors that further investigation regarding vaccination with BNT162b2 in 
subjects at higher risk of COVID-19 (e.g., patients on hemodialysis) or special populations, including 
elderly and pregnant/lactating women, is needed. From the literature provided by the MAH, no new 
safety issues were identified. No changes to the product information are considered warranted at this 
moment.

PRAC comment: 
Regarding the ongoing signals ‘Myocarditis and Pericarditis’ and ‘Dizziness’:  
After the DLP of the ACO, section 4.4 of the SmPC has been updated with a warning for myocarditis 
and pericarditis (procedure IAIN/0050). Dizziness was included as part of ‘stress-related responses 
associated with the process of vaccination’ in section 4.4 of the SmPC. Myocarditis and Pericarditis 
were also added as ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
With regards to the closed signals for which signal closed is accepted: 
Anaphylaxis: included as ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC and added as important identified risk in the 
RMP. Signal closed is accepted. 
Hypersensitivity reactions (other than anaphylaxis): included as ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC 
(procedure Type II/0016/G).  
Signal closed is accepted. 
Pain in extremity: included as ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC (procedure Type II/0016/G). Signal 
closed is accepted. 
Vomiting: included as ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC (procedure Type II/0016/G). Signal closed is 
accepted. 
Diarrhoea: included as ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC (procedure Type II/0016/G). Signal closed is 
accepted. 
Tachycardia: as part of a warning about stress-related responses with the process of vaccination added 
to section 4.4. of the SmPC. Signal closed is accepted. 
Vaccine stress-related responses: a warning about stress-related responses with the process of 
vaccination added to section 4.4. of the SmPC. Signal closed is accepted. 
Facial nerve palsy: included as ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Signal closed is accepted. 
Insomnia: included as ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Signal closed is accepted. 
Injection site pruritus: included as ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Signal closed is accepted. 
Overdose: based on review of post-authorisation medication errors of full vial dosing and co-reported 
adverse event in the 2nd MSSR, no significant new safety information was identified and no updates to 
the Overdose section of labelling was warranted. Signal closed is accepted.  
Eye pain & Eye swelling: review of the cases reporting eye pain and/or eye swelling in the 2nd MSSR 
did not suggest a causal association with the Comirnaty vaccine. No update of the included ADRs in the 
Comirnaty SmPC was considered needed regarding eye pain and eye swelling. Closure of the signal 
concerning “Eye pain” and “Eye swelling” is accepted. 
Hearing loss and Tinnitus: In the 3rd MSSR AR (covering 1 February until 28 February 2021), based on 
a cumulative review of the cases reporting hearing loss and/or tinnitus it was concluded that a causal 
association with Comirnaty exposure was not suggested and the signal was closed. 
Seizure: under close monitoring as part of Neurological AESIs in the MSSRs. At the moment no new 
safety signal of seizure identified. Signal closed is accepted. 
Reaction associated with dermal fillers: after the DLP of the ACO, Facial swelling (in vaccine recipients 
with a history of injection of dermatological fillers) has been added to section 4.8 of the SmPC 
(EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0038/G). Signal closed is accepted. 
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/596333/2021 
 
 
 
 
 
Delayed skin reactions: based on a review by the MAH of literature and cases reporting delayed skin 
reactions, a causal association was not supported. Signal closed is accepted. 
Delayed syncope: following US-FDA request, delayed syncope and loss of consciousness were 
evaluated by the MAH. It was concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support a causal 
relationship to the vaccine. Signal closed is accepted. 
Extensive swelling of vaccinated limb: after the DLP of the ACO, Extensive swelling of the vaccinated 
limb has been added to section 4.8 of the SmPC (EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0038/G). Signal closed is 
accepted. 
The closed signals for which however further evaluation is ongoing or requested in MSSR/PSUR 
and therefore cannot be considered closed are the following:  
Paraesthesia: as part of a warning about stress-related responses with the process of vaccination 
added to section 4.4. of the SmPC. This signal is closed, however, for the 8th MSSR (covering 1 July-31 
July 2021) the MAH has been requested to provide an analysis of hypoaesthesia and paraesthesia and 
to discuss whether paraesthesia and hypoaesthesia are sufficiently covered in the product information 
in the context of stress-related reactions or these should be included in the product information as 
separate ADRs.  
As an outcome of the review provided by the MAH in the 9th MSSR, PRAC did not agree that 
hypoesthesia/paraesthesia is sufficiently covered in the product information by the currently included 
text regarding stress-related reactions and requested the MAH to add hypoesthesia and paraesthesia 
to the product information (SmPC section 4.8 and PIL section 4) and to propose a frequency, via an 
appropriate variation procedure. 
Asthenia, Lethargy, Decreased appetite, Hyperhidrosis, Night sweats: the CHMP adopted an Opinion on 
the 16th September 2021 to add as side effects to the product information of Comirnaty.  
Deaths including elderly or frail individuals: no new safety information was identified based on review 
of the fatal cases (EMEA/H/C/005735/LEG/019). Death/fatal cases are reviewed in the MSSRs as a 
Special Situation. 
Immune thrombocytopenia: a re-review of this signal is provided in the PSUR submitted in August 
2021. 
Thromboembolic events, including those associated with thrombocytopenia: at the moment, there is 
insufficient evidence to support a causal association. However, TTS (Thrombosis with 
Thrombocytopenia Syndrome) is an ongoing signal of the MSSR for Comirnaty. In addition, 
thromboembolic events are reviewed in the MSSRs as AESIs. 
Herpes zoster, including ophthalmic herpes zoster: it should be noted that following assessment of the 
7th MSSR, the MAH was requested to provide an analysis of herpes zoster and discuss possible 
mechanisms that could underpin herpes zoster reactivation following vaccination, in the PSUR 
submitted in August 2021.

a.  As per EU RMP ver. 1.0 (dated 21 December 2020). 
b.  As per the EUA PVP ver. 0.2 (dated 05 December 2021). 
During the reporting period, the EU RMP has been updated as follows: 
• 
EU RMP version 1.0 (dated 21 December 2021, when the initial marketing authorization was 
granted) was updated during the reporting period (EU RMP version 1.1, dated 17 March 2021 
and approved on 15 April 2021), to revise the post-authorization vaccine effectiveness study 
C4591014 included in the RMP (Category 3) as a commitment and to add 2 vaccine 
effectiveness epidemiology studies (WI235284 and WI255886) not sponsored by Pfizer.   
•  After DLP of this ACO, on 4 May 2021 and on 14 May 2021, EU RMP version 2.0 (dated 29 April 
2021) and version 2.1 (dated 14 May 2021) were submitted.  
EU RMP version 2.0 was submitted on 30 April 2021 with Variation 0030 to seek for extension 
of the indication to individuals aged 12-15 years of age; on 28 May 2021, EMA CHMP 
recommended granting the extension of indication for use in children aged 12-15 years and the 
European Commission adopted a decision accordingly on 31 May 2021. 
EU RMP version 2.1 has been submitted in the context of Variation 0036.   
No changes to the list of the safety concerns were implemented in the above stated EU RMPs during 
and after the reporting period of this ACO. 
PRAC comment: 
Based on the data submitted with the renewal application, no changes are warranted for the RMP.  
At the end of the interval period, the missing information “Use in pediatric individuals <16 years of 
age” was re-worded to “Use in paediatric individuals <12 years of age”, which is only applicable for the 
EUA US PVP.  
Furthermore, the CHMP adopted an Opinion on the 16th September 2021 for the 
EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0036 variation in which the RMP version 2.2 was approved.

4.  Risk management plan 
The MAH has confirmed the current approved RMP remains unchanged and applicable. 
Since the granting of the marketing authorisation, the following changes have been implemented in 
the RMP: 
•  Revision of the Pharmacovigilance Plan, including updates on milestones, objectives, study 
rationale and design; 
•  Revision of the post-authorization vaccine effectiveness study C4591014 and addition of 2 
new vaccine effectiveness epidemiology studies; 
•  Update of the indication to include individuals aged 12-15 years, with supporting 
epidemiology and exposure data; 
• 
• 
Inclusion of myocarditis and pericarditis as important identified risks, with supporting data 
from clinical trials and safety databases and update of the information on planned/ongoing 
post-authorization safety studies with inclusion of 2 new studies, and the circulation of a 
DHPC; 
Inclusion of a new formulation and update on potential medication errors. 
5.  Changes to the Product Information 
No changes to the Product Information (PI) are introduced with this renewal procedure. 
Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Comirnaty (COVID-19 mRNA vaccine 
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/596333/2021 
Page 37/43 
 
 
 
 
(nucleoside-modified)) is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active 
substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the 
EU and it is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation. 
The summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet therefore includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle 
6.  Request for Supplementary Information - RfSI 
The MAH should provide the following supplementary information in response to Day 60 RfSI: 
6.1.  Other concerns 
Clinical aspects 
1.  The MAH is requested to provide the findings of the inspection performed on 8-9 March 2021 
by Swissmedic. 
2.  The MAH is requested to explain what “BNT162S017” is compared to BNT162b1 and 
BNT162b2. 
7.  Assessment of the MAH responses to the RfSI 
7.1.  Other concerns 
Clinical aspects 
Question 1 
The MAH is requested to provide the findings of the inspection performed on 8-9 March 2021 
by Swissmedic. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The findings of the inspection performed on 8-9 March 2021 by Swissmedic can be found in the audit 
report herewith submitted as attachment to the cover letter. The audit report is a redacted copy of the 
final Pfizer response (redacted inspector names and Pfizer names for privacy), also you will notice 
there are track changes in the report as Swissmedic had asked for updated responses to be tracked in 
the final response as accepted by Swissmedic. Additionally, please note that this audit report contains 
information that is considered confidential by Pfizer.. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
As requested, the MAH provided the findings of the inspection performed by Swissmedic on 8-9 March 
2021. It is acknowledged that the content of the audit report is confidential and therefore is not

presented in this assessment report. In the context of the MSSR assessment, several comments have 
been made regarding the handling and presentation of data. The inspection from Swissmedic did not 
raise additional issues relevant for the EU. 
Conclusion 
Issue is solved. 
Question 2 
The MAH is requested to explain what “BNT162S017” is compared to BNT162b1 and 
BNT162b2. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The code BNT162S017 reported on page 12 of the Addendum to the Clinical Overview submitted in the 
renewal application results from a typo and should be read as BNT162b2s01. 
The figure 7 at the end of the code refers to the footnote 7 where it is stated that BNT162S01 is also 
named BNT162SA. In the same footnote (footnote 7, Page 12) BNT162SA should read as 
BNT162b2SA. 
Both these codes (BNT162b2s01 and BNT162b2SA, in the submitted ACO erroneously reported as 
BNT162S01 and BNT162SA) refer to the same clinical candidate, a new construct based on BNT162b2 
and modified to address the B.1.351 lineage, first identified in South Africa. This clinical vaccine 
candidate has been introduced in study C4591001 / BNT162-02 as part of the global program to 
address emerging variants. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The code “BNT162S017” was a typo and should be BNT162b2s01, also named BNT162b2SA , which is 
explained as a new construct based on BNT162b2 and modified to address the B.1.351 lineage, first 
identified in South Africa. This is noted. 
Conclusion 
Issue is solved. 
8.  Overall conclusions and benefit-risk balance 
8.1.  Specific Obligations (SOBs) 
Compliance of SOB data submitted 
During the period covered by this annual renewal, data on the Quality Specific Obligations (SOBs) have 
been submitted. Interim reports and monthly updates have been provided as requested. 
Assessment report on the annual renewal of the conditional marketing authorisation  
EMA/596333/2021 
Page 39/43 
 
 
 
 
Regarding  the  Quality  SOB  003:  In  order  to  confirm  the  consistency  of  the  finished  product 
manufacturing  process,  the  MAH  should  provide  additional  validation  data,  on  the  20th  May  2021, 
following 
the 
assessment 
of 
additional 
validation 
data 
(provided 
in 
variation 
EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0023/G), the CHMP was of the opinion that the obligation had been fulfilled, and 
therefore recommended its deletion from the Annex II. 
For the Quality SOB 001, SOB 002, SOB 004 and SOB 005 the due date was July 2021. On 27 July and 
2  August  2021  respectively,  the  MAH  submitted  two  variations  (EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0054/G  and 
EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0056/G)  to  provide  the  additional  data  requested  to  fulfil  these  SOBs.  These 
variations  are  currently  under  assessment  by  CHMP  and  Requests  for  Further  Information  have  been 
adopted on 14 October 2021.  
During the period covered by this annual renewal interim data on the clinical SOB 006 have been 
submitted that overall are compliant in terms of adherence to deadlines and in terms of acceptability of 
data submitted. The available clinical evidence includes a tolerable safety profile and high vaccine 
efficacy against COVID-19 in individuals ≥12 years of age.  
Updated list of specific obligations (SOBs) 
In the framework of a conditional marketing authorisation and pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation 
(EC) No 726/2004, the MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the following measures: 
Number 
Description 
Due date 
SOB 001 
In order to complete the characterisation of the active substance 
July 2021 
and finished product, the MAH should provide additional data.  
SOB 002 
In order to ensure consistent product quality, the MAH should 
July 2021 
provide additional information to enhance the control strategy, 
including the active substance and finished product specifications.  
SOB 004 
In order to confirm the purity profile and ensure comprehensive 
July 2021 
quality control and batch-to-batch consistency throughout the 
lifecycle of the finished product, the MAH should provide additional 
information about the synthetic process and control strategy for 
the excipient ALC-0315.  
SOB 005 
In order to confirm the purity profile and ensure comprehensive 
July 2021 
quality control and batch-to-batch consistency throughout the 
lifecycle of the finished product, the MAH should provide additional 
information about the synthetic process and control strategy for 
the excipient ALC-0159. 
SOB 006 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of Comirnaty, the MAH 
Dec 2023 
should submit the final Clinical Study Report for the randomized, 
placebo-controlled, observer-blind study C4591001. 
8.2.  Benefit-risk Balance 
During the period covered by this annual renewal, new data have emerged. However, these data do 
not have an impact on the established benefit-risk balance of Comirnaty in the approved indication. 
The data collected as part of the specific obligations for Comirnaty during the period covered by this 
annual renewal support its positive benefit-risk balance in the approved indication.

Favourable effects 
The favourable effects were demonstrated in the initial marketing authorisation for persons 16 years of 
age and older and updated in a type II variation to also include adolescents 12-15 years of age. No 
additional efficacy data have been submitted during this renewal procedure. The most important 
favourable effects are briefly summarised below.  
The overall vaccine efficacy against symptomatic laboratory confirmed COVID-19 from 7 days after 
dose 2 was 95.0% (95% CI 90.0, 97.9) in subjects ≥16 years of age without prior evidence of SARS 
CoV2 infection and 94.6% (95% CI 89.6, 97.6) in all subjects regardless of prior evidence of SARS 
CoV-2 infection (primary endpoint). This outcome met the pre-specified success criteria.   
The efficacy of the vaccine (BNT162b2, 2 doses of 30 µg, separated by 21 days) to prevent COVID-19 
in the adolescents aged 12- 15 years either without or with and without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 
infection, occurring at least 7 days after the second dose, was 100.0% (CI95% 75.3, 100).  
In addition, Comirnaty was shown to elicit non-inferior immune responses in subjects 12-15 years of 
age without previous Covid-19 compared to subjects 16-25 years in terms of geometric mean titres of 
neutralising antibodies one-month post dose 2. 
Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects  
The uncertainties and limitations of favourable effects are similar to those at the time of the initial 
assessment and were updated in variation EMEA/H/C/005735/II/0030 (12-15-year-old subjects). The 
principal uncertainties remain on duration of protection and efficacy in risk groups, e.g. pregnant 
women and immunocompromised subjects. Since the initial approval, uncertainty regarding the 
vaccine efficacy against upcoming virus variants of concern has arisen with variants of concern (VOC) 
emergence. 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety of Comirnaty was evaluated in participants 16 years of age and older in 2 clinical studies 
(BNT162-01 and C4591001) that included 21,744 participants that have received at least one dose of 
Comirnaty in the initial approval application. Overall, the safety profile of Comirnaty is considered 
acceptable. The product information has been updated since approval as new data has emerged. All 
data have been assessed in other procedures such as monthly safety updates, signal assessments and 
variations. 
Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The uncertainties and limitations of unfavourable effects have been discussed in other procedures. The 
principal uncertainties are related to long-term effects, and effects in specific risk groups.   
Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
The benefits of Comirnaty in terms of protection against COVID-19 clearly outweigh the identified 
risks, and no new information has emerged during this renewal period that has changed the balance. 
The clinical SOBs are currently ongoing, according to plan. The quality related SOBs are also 
considered either fulfilled or ongoing according to plan.

Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Not Applicable. 
Balance of benefits and risks 
Based on the cumulative evidence in terms of favourable and unfavourable effects, the benefit-risk 
balance of Comirnaty remains positive.  
9.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the available information on the status of the fulfilment of Specific Obligations, 
the marketing authorisation holder has complied with the specific obligations and the benefit-risk 
balance for Comirnaty in its approved indication (please refer to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics) continues to be favourable, and therefore the renewal of the conditional marketing 
authorisation is recommended, subject to the conditions and obligations as detailed in this assessment 
report. 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
The renewal requires no amendments to the terms of the marketing authorisation. 
Conditions of the marketing authorisation 
The marketing authorisation is subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the 
medicinal product 
Risk management plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result 
of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached. 
Specific obligations to complete post-authorisation measures for the 
conditional marketing authorisation 
This being a conditional marketing authorisation and pursuant to Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No

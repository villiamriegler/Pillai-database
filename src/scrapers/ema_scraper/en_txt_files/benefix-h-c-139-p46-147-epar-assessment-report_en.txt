Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short clinical overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
According to the MAH, Study B1821059 entitled “A Single Country, Multicenter, Open-label and Non-
Randomized Clinical Trial with Nonacog Alfa Prophylaxis and Treatment of Bleeding Episodes in Previ-
ously Treated Patients with Moderately-Severe to Severe Haemophilia B for a Duration of 8 Weeks.” is 
a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
BeneFIX (nonacog alfa) is a recombinant DNA-based protein therapeutic, which has structural and 
functional characteristics comparable to endogenous factor IX. Nonacog alfa is a freeze-dried lyophi-
lized powder for reconstitution in a single-use vial. Each vial contains nominally 250, 500, 1000, 2000, 
or 3000 international units (IU). 
Nonacog alfa received first regulatory approval on 11 February 1997 in the United States (US). It was 
reformulated to decrease the occurrence of red blood cell agglutination in the syringe or tubing. The 
reformulation involved no changes to the active ingredient (recombinant FIX protein), but included a 
change in the diluent (from sterile water to 0.234% NaCl). Reformulated nonacog alfa was approved 
for use in the European Union and the US in 2007 and since January 2009, only the reformulated ver-
sion of nonacog alfa is being distributed worldwide. Presently, BeneFIX is approved in 85 countries and 
marketed in 66 countries. In India, BeneFIX achieved regulatory approval on 26 September 2019 and 
is indicated for the treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia B (congenital 
factor IX deficiency).

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
On 16 March 2021, the MAH submitted the final report of Study B1821059, in accordance with Article 
46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended. In addition, a short clinical overview has been pro-
vided. 
As stated by the applicant  in the cover letter (dated 16 March 2021), this submission does not have 
any impact on the overall benefit-risk profile of BeneFIX, nor any impact on the already approved EU 
SmPC.  
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Clinical study number and title 
Study B1821059: A Single Country, Multicenter, Open-label and Non-Randomized Clinical Trial with 
Nonacog Alfa Prophylaxis and Treatment of Bleeding Episodes in Previously Treated Patients with Mod-
erately-Severe to Severe Haemophilia B for a Duration of 8 Weeks. 
Description 
Study B1821059 was a single-country, multicenter, open-label, single arm, interventional study con-
ducted in India. This study evaluated BeneFIX (nonacog alfa, recombinant Factor IX) and was conduct-
ed as a post-approval commitment to fulfill the Central Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) 
written request for supplementary information relating to the use of nonacog alfa in Indian participants 
with haemophilia B. The study evaluated the safety and efficacy of nonacog alfa prophylaxis in a total 
of 25 Indian participants with congenital moderately-severe to severe haemophilia B (factor IX [FIX] 
activity ≤2%) including 3 adolescents. The overall treatment duration for each subject was up to 8 
weeks, with up to a 4-week screening period and a subsequent 28-day safety observation period. The 
FSFV was on 10 February 2020 and the LSLV occurred on 24 September 2020.

Study design 
Study B1821059 was a single-country, multicenter, open-label, single arm, interventional study con-
ducted in India. Subjects were monitored according to local standard of care, which should be in ac-
cordance with the local product document (LPD). 
At least 25 male subjects aged ≥12 years to ≤65 years with congenital moderately-severe to severe 
hemophilia B (FIX activity ≤2%) who have had at least 50 exposure days (EDs) to FIX-containing 
products were planned to be enrolled. 
The overall treatment duration for each subject was up to 8 weeks (or at least 16 EDs), with up to a 4-
week screening period and a subsequent 28 day safety observation period. Subjects were treated with 
a dose and regimen of nonacog alfa prophylaxis in accordance with the LPD. 
Study population /Sample size 
Study B1821059 was open to male Indian participants aged ≥12 years to ≤65 years with congenital 
moderately-severe to severe haemophilia B (factor IX [FIX] activity ≤2%) who have had at least 50 
EDs to FIX-containing products. 
Treatments 
Prophylaxis: 
The mean prophylactic dose of nonacog alfa per the LPD was 40 IU/kg with a range 13 to 78 IU/kg at 
intervals of 3 to 4 days. 
On-Demand Treatment: 
The amount to be administered and the frequency of administration was tailored to the clinical effec-
tiveness in individual participants. 
Nonacog alfa was administered by the investigator or a delegate at Visits 2 and 3. For administration 
between study visits, the product was administered in accordance with procedures provided by their 
physicians. Subjects or caregivers/parents of subjects were trained on how to administer nonacog alfa, 
away from the study site, as applicable. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint 
The proportion of subjects who develop FIX inhibitor (≥0.6 BU/mL), as confirmed by central laboratory 
testing, during the course of the study 
Secondary Endpoints 
• 
• 
Incidence of SAEs (including medically important events, thrombotic events, and hypersensitiv-
ity reactions). 
Incidence of AEs.

•  Annualized bleeding rate (ABR) during prophylaxis. 
•  Annualized total factor consumption (TFC) in international units (IU) and annualized TFC by 
weight (IU/kg) of nonacog alfa measured during the up to 8 weeks of treatment, by reason for 
infusion and total units consumed (across all reasons). 
•  Number of nonacog alfa infusions used to treat each bleed. 
Statistical Methods 
No formal statistical sample size computation was performed for this study. The sample size rationale 
was based on the written request of the CDSCO. Results of this study were presented using descriptive 
statistics. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Thirty participants were screened for the study and 25 (83.3%) participants were enrolled and com-
pleted the study. Five (16.7%) participants discontinued during the screening period and of those 3 
discontinued during screening (were screen failures) due to a recruitment pause caused by the COVID-
19 pandemic. All enrolled participants (25 [100.0%]) were male Indian Subcontinent Asian. The major-
ity of participants (22 [88.0%]) were 18-65 years of age and 3 were <18 years old  
Baseline data 
Twelve (48.0%) participants had a family history of haemophilia (of which 1 was a pediatric subject). 
Factor IX mutation was not classified in any participants. Twenty-four (96.0%) participants had no 
family history of inhibitors to FIX products, and no participants had a history of allergy to FIX products. 
All participants (25 [100.0%]) were classified as having severe disease (determined based on investi-
gator’s assessment of clinical bleeding symptoms), and had at least 50 EDs to FIX-containing products. 
The mean number of prior FIX exposure days was 112.6 ± 108.94 days (median: 77.0; min-max: 50–
500 days) Twenty-four (96.0%) participants had identified target joints at screening. 
Efficacy results 
Efficacy parameters included evaluation of ABR during prophylaxis (based on all bleeds requiring on-
demand treatment with nonacog alfa during the treatment interval duration [up to 8 weeks of treat-
ment, or sooner, once 16 EDs were achieved]), annualized TFC of nonacog alfa, and the number of 
nonacog alfa infusions used to treat each bleed. 
There were no bleeding events during the treatment phase of the study that required on-demand infu-
sion of nonacog alfa. There were 17 bleeding episodes (16 spontaneous (1 paediatric subject) and 1 
traumatic) among 10 participants that were not treated with nonacog alfa infusions. Sixteen of these 
bleeding episodes occurred post-treatment while one bleeding episode occurred during the treatment 
phase. Fifteen of these bleeding episodes were treated with other FIX products, and 2 were minor 
bleeding events that resolved without treatment. 
The mean annualized TFC per participant was 224,582.44 ± 75,526.750 IU (median: 205,052.63; min-
max: 99050.9–431,114.8 IU). The mean annualized TFC by weight per participant was 3639.27 ± 
572.778 IU/kg (median: 3749.24; min-max: 1792.5-4222.1 IU/kg) for infusions administered during 
the study. All study intervention infusions were administered as prophylaxis.

Safety results 
Safety assessments throughout the study included collection of AEs, laboratory safety testing, vital 
signs, and physical examination. FIX inhibitor development, thrombotic events, and hypersensitivity 
reactions were considered medically important events. 
Each participant in the study received a total of 16 prophylactic infusions of nonacog alfa; mean treat-
ment interval duration was 61.80 ± 14.416 days (median: 59.00; min-max: 55.0–130.0 days). 
Three out of the 25 (12.0%) participants had a total of 3 AEs (2 mild [pyrexia and cough] and 1 mod-
erate [dental caries]), which were treatment-emergent. None of the 3 AEs occurred in a paediatric par-
ticipant. None of the AEs were considered related to the study intervention or to be haemophilia or de-
vice-related and no severe AEs were reported. No participant discontinued the study or study interven-
tion due to AEs and there were no dose reductions or temporary discontinuations due to AEs. There 
were no deaths or other SAEs among participants in the study. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
As part of this Article 46 procedure, the MAH submitted the final study report of Study B1821059 to-
gether with a clinical overview. Study B1821059 was a post-approval commitment to fulfil the Central 
Drugs Standard Control Organization (CDSCO) written request for supplementary information relating 
to the use of nonacog alfa in Indian participants with haemophilia B.  
In Study B1821059, safety and efficacy data were collected from a total of 25 previously treated Indi-
an patients (>50 EDs) with moderately-severe to severe haemophilia B (FIX activity ≤2%). The study 
population included three paediatric subjects, i.e. three adolescents of 12, 15 and 17 years of age. 
Standard measurements (i.e. incidences of AE, SAEs, inhibitor development, ABR, no. of on-demand 
infusions, annualized factor consumption) were used to evaluate safety and efficacy of nonacog alfa 
based on an 8-week period of prophylactic treatment and a subsequent 28-day safety follow-up. Dos-
ing recommendations were generally in line with the posology of BeneFIX as reflected in its EU SmPC 
(i.e. 40 IU/kg [range 13 to 78 IU/kg] at intervals of 3 to 4 days). The study was conducted during the 
COVID-19 pandemic. However, the impact of COVID-19-related restrictions remained minor, and the 
study achieved its objectives and could be completed despite the pandemic. 
The clinical overview covers the whole study population. A separate evaluation of the paediatric data 
has not been provided. However, review of the clinical study report did not reveal any meaningful dif-
ferences between adolescents and adults, neither with regard to the age-independent baseline charac-
teristics nor to the clinical outcomes obtained in these two age groups. As regards efficacy, results of 
Study B1821059 generally support the notion of prophylaxis efficacy of nonacog alfa, with no reported 
bleeding events requiring treatment during prophylaxis compared to a total of fifteen bleeding events 
(in 8 subjects) requiring treatment that occurred in the subsequent 28-day safety follow up (i.e. after 
termination of nonacog alfa treatment). Both, average doses of nonacog alfa administered per prophy-
lactic infusion as well as total FIX consumption were generally in line with the EU SmPC. As regards 
safety, treatment with nanocog alfa was well tolerated and none of the reported AEs were assessed as 
related to its administration. None of the participants developed a FIX inhibitor and there were no re-
ports of thrombotic events or hypersensitivity reactions. Overall, safety data obtained in Study 
B1821059 were generally consistent with the known safety profile of BeneFIX. 
However, according to the current EMA clinical guideline for factor IX products (EMA/CHMP/BPWP/ 
144552/2009 rev. 2 Corr. 1), the number of patients typically needed in a post-marketing study to 
cover especially immunogenicity aspects (besides general efficacy and safety) is 50, followed up to 100 
EDs. Hence, considering the small sample size of only 25 subjects and the extremely short treatment

period of only 8 weeks (or 16 EDs), the informative value of the data obtained in Study B1821059 re-
mains limited. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
In summary, data obtained in the three paediatric subjects included in Study B1821059 do not change 
the favourable benefit risk profile of BeneFIX (Nonacog alfa) in children. The presented data do not 
warrant any update of the Product information. No additional clarifications requested. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required. 
Annex. Line listing of all the studies included in the develop-
ment program

1.  Introduction 
On 7-8-17, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Emtriva in accordance with Article 46 
of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study GS-US-162-0112, ‘A Rollover Protocol to Provide Subjects Completing the 
FTC-203 Study in South Africa with Continued Access to Emtricitabine’ is a standalone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulations used in the study 
Emtriva 200 mg capsule or 10 mg/mL oral solution. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  MAH  submitted  a  final  report  for  GS-US-162-0112,  ‘A  Rollover  Protocol  to  Provide  Subjects 
Completing the FTC-203 Study in South Africa with Continued Access to Emtricitabine’. Study GS-US-
162-0112  was  a  rollover  study  to  provide  subjects  completing  Study  FTC-203  in  South  Africa  with 
continued access to emtricitabine. 
Study FTC-203 was a multi-centre, open-label, non-randomised Phase 2 clinical study to evaluate the 
safety,  antiretroviral  activity  and  pharmacokinetics  of  emtricitabine  in  combination  with  other 
antiretroviral  agents  in  paediatric  HIV-infected  patients.  The  study  enrolled  116  HIV-1  infected, 
antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive and ART-experienced, male and female paediatric patients between 
the  ages  of  3  months  and  17  years,  inclusive,  across  12  study  centres  located  in  the  USA  (8;  22 
subjects), South Africa (2; 59 subjects), Mexico (1; 6 subjects) and Panama (1; 29 subjects). 
Subjects  were  treated  in  Study  FTC-203  for  an  initial  period  of  at  least  48  weeks.  This  was 
subsequently extended to 96 weeks, and then extended again until the drug was available via market 
distribution in the subject’s country of residence, providing subjects met and continued to have plasma 
HIV-1 RNA ≤ 400 copies/mL or, if HIV-1 RNA was > 400 copies/mL, it was < 1.0 log 10 above the nadir 
recorded after Week 8 and there was reliable genotypic evidence showing a lack of viral resistance to 
emtricitabine. 
With  the  last  subjects  completing  the  original  48-week  study  duration  in  May  2004,  the  decision  was 
made  to  close  the  FTC-203  study  after  the  last  subjects  completed  their  Week  96  visit.  In  those 
countries  where  regulatory  approval  for  market  distribution  of  emtricitabine  had  yet  to  be  sought 
and/or was pending, alternative means to continue to provide FTC-203 study participants with access 
to emtricitabine were implemented.  
The  purpose  GS-US-162-0112  study  was  to  allow  those  FTC-203  study  subjects  in  South  Africa  to 
continue to receive emtricitabine (either capsule or oral solution formulation) beyond completion of the 
FTC-203  study.  Eligible  subjects  electing  to  participate  thus  continued  to  receive  emtricitabine,

administered  in  combination  with  other  antiretroviral  medications,  so  long  as  virologic  criteria  were 
met. 
Study GS-US-162-0112 is now complete. A synoptic clinical study report (CSR) detailing the results of 
the study is included in this Article 46 paediatric study submission to fulfil the obligation to submit any 
MAH-sponsored  studies  involving  the  use  of  an  authorised  medicinal  product  in  the  paediatric 
population to the EMA. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
GS-US-162-0112, ‘A Rollover Protocol to Provide Subjects Completing the FTC-203 Study in 
South Africa with Continued Access to Emtricitabine’ 
Description 
This was an uncontrolled open-label study of follow-on treatment. Subjects were managed using local 
standard  of  care  practices  with  the  subject  returning  to  the  clinic  approximately  every  12  weeks  for 
study visits (4 visits per year). The Investigator could choose to have the subject return to the clinic on 
a  more  frequent  basis  as  part  of  their  standard  of  care,  but  these  visits  were  outside  of  the  protocol 
defined visit schedule. 
Data  collection  was  limited  to  the  reporting  of  adverse  events  (AEs)  that  (1)  met  the  criteria  for  a 
serious  adverse  event  (SAE),  (2)  resulted  in  permanent  discontinuation  of  the  study  drug, 
emtricitabine, and/or (3) were associated with skin discoloration (hyperpigmentation). 
HIV-1  RNA  viral  load  levels  were  assessed  at  each  clinic  visit  to  ensure  continued  subject  eligibility 
regarding the virologic criteria; however, these data were not recorded in the case report form (CRF). 
Results 
This  submission  presents  the  results  of  the  analysis  performed  after  the  last  subject  had  completed 
Study GS-US-162-0112.  
In Study FTC-203, 59 subjects were enrolled at 2 study centres in South Africa; of these, 50 subjects 
continued  in  the  rollover  Study  GS-US-162-0112  and  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study  drug.  Nine  of 
the  50  (18.0%)  completed  the  study,  23  (46.0%)  rolled  over  to  Study  GS-US-292-1515  and  18 
(36.0%) prematurely discontinued the study. Reasons for premature discontinuation of the study were 
as shown in the table below. 
A  total  of  52.0%  (26  subjects)  were  male.  The  mean  age  was  8  years  (range,  4  to  16  years).  The 
majority was black (98.0%, 49 subjects). 
No subject died and none experienced an AE leading to study discontinuation.  
There were 3 pregnancies during the study: one pregnancy was terminated and resulted in incomplete 
abortion; the other 2 pregnancies resulted in healthy infant births.

A total of 38.0% (19 subjects) experienced hyperpigmentation. The hyperpigmentation usually affected 
the  hands  (89.5%,  17  subjects)  and  feet  (42.1%,  8  subjects);  other  areas  affected  were  the  oral 
mucosa  (10.5%,  2  subjects)  and  arms  (5.3%,  1  subject).  In  8  of  the  19  subjects  (42.1%),  the 
hyperpigmentation was reported only at baseline, indicating that it resolved while continuing treatment 
with FTC. 
Thirteen  of  the  50  subjects  had  SAEs;  all  SAEs  were  assessed  by  the  investigator  as  not  related  to 
emtricitabine. Narratives are provided. Review of these narratives by the assessor indicates that most 
were due to intercurrent illness or trauma. It is agreed that none seem likely to have been related to 
treatment  with  emtricitabine.  One  case  of  anaemia  and  neutropenia  appears  to  have  been  related  to 
introduction of zidovudine into her ART regimen. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
In  the  adult  clinical  trials,  skin  discoloration  was  reported  more  frequently  in  patients  treated  with 
emtricitabine,  as  compared  to  patients  enrolled  in  control  groups.  The  skin  discoloration  occurred  as 
hyperpigmentation,  most  commonly  on  the  palms  and/or  soles,  and  was  always  mild  or  moderate, 
generally  asymptomatic  and  without  association  with  any  pathologic  skin  condition.  If  a  subject 
developed  hyperpigmentation  while  participating  in  this  rollover  study,  the  hyperpigmentation  was 
documented as an AE and a Hyperpigmentation Assessment CRF was completed.  
The  subject  may  also  have  had  one  or  more  dermatological  consultations  and  possibly  other 
explorations, as deemed necessary by the dermatologist.

The  reported  rate  for  hyperpigmentation  in  this  study  makes  this  ADR  very  common.  The  SmPC  for 
Emtriva lists hyperpigmentation as a common ADR  but there is a footnote to the table in section 4.8 
that states that it was very common in paediatric subjects. Therefore, the observed rate in the study is 
already reflected in the SmPC. 
No  viral  load  data  were  captured  but  the  protocol  did  include  criteria  that  had  to  be  met  to  allow 
continued treatment with Emtriva. It seems that 8 subjects (16%) were discontinued due to virologic 
failure, which is not such an unusual rate in paediatric trials.

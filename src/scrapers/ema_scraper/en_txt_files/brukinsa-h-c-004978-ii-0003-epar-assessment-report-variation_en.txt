international, Phase 3, open-label, multiple-cohort, randomized study designed to evaluate the efficacy 
of zanubrutinib versus B+R in patients with previously untreated CLL/SLL, and  Study BGB-3111-305; 
an ongoing, international Phase 3, open-label, randomized study of zanubrutinib versus ibrutinib with 
R/R CLL/SLL.   
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4,5, 4.6, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are being updated. 
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance.  
An updated RMP version 1.1 (specific for the proposed indication CLL/SLL) was also submitted. 
In addition, as part of the application the MAH requested a 1-year extension of the market protection.    
The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet 
and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0398/2019 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP was not yet completed as some measures were 
deferred.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the application included a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products. 
Scientific advice 
The MAH did seek Scientific Advice at the CHMP in 2016; EMEA/H/SA/3376/1/2016/II and in 2017a 
follow up EMEA/H/SA/3376/1/FU/1/2017/II. The overall study design features for study 304 (1L CLL)

were agreed upon with EMA, although the interim analysis was discouraged. Initially, the MAH 
proposed one pivotal study to support the use of zanubrutinib in treatment-naïve (TN) and R/R CLL 
patients. However, the CHMP did not support this proposal and expressed several concerns regarding 
the design and power of the study to support the claimed indication. In the follow-up advice in 2017 
the MAH proposed study 304 in TN patients. For study 304 the proposed study design and primary 
endpoint (PFS by IRC) were endorsed by the CHMP. The MAH changed the originally proposed study 
design in patients with R/R CLL without further interaction with the CHMP (primary endpoint of PFS 
was changed to ORR).

2  Scientific discussion 
2.1  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The claimed the therapeutic indication was applied as: BRUKINSA is indicated for the treatment of 
adult patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). The final 
approved indication is: Brukinsa as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). 
Epidemiology  
CLL/SLL is the most common leukemia in the Western world, with an incidence of 4.2 cases in every 
100,000 persons per year. The incidence increases to > 30 in 100,000 per year in people aged more 
than 80 years. In the US, incidence of CLL is 4.9 cases per 100, in Europe, 4.9 CLL/SLL cases per 100,000 
persons.  It  is  estimated  that  there  are  approximately  191,000  cases  and  61,000  deaths  per  year 
attributed to CLL/SLL worldwide.  
The median age at time of diagnosis is 70 years, and approximately two-thirds of patients are over 65 
years  of  age.  The  disease  is  more  common  in  men  versus  women,  and  in  Caucasian  versus  black, 
Hispanic, or Asian populations.  
Biologic features   
The  World  Health  Organization  (WHO)  classification  considers  CLL  and  SLL  to  be  different  clinical 
manifestations of the same disease; therefore, CLL and SLL are considered collectively.  
While CLL/SLL is a highly heterogenous disease in terms of disease course, with several patient-related 
(such as age and comorbidity) and disease-related (such as stage and immunoglobulin heavy chain gene 
rearrangement  status)  factors  that  carry  prognostic  significance,  the  loss  of  the  TP53  locus  on 
chromosome 17p13.1 (del(17p)) is the most significant poor prognostic feature in this disease.  
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Patients with loss of 17p13.1, as well as those that harbor a mutation of the TP53 gene, have a grim 
prognosis in response to chemoimmunotherapy and tend to show marked resistance against genotoxic 
chemotherapies that cannot be overcome by the addition of anti-CD20 antibodies. While the overall 5-
year survival rate is high (> 85% in the USA) for those who receive appropriate treatment, fewer than 
25% of the highest-risk subset of patients (based on TP53 gene dysfunction and clinical factors) would 
be expected to survive 5 years. Staging of CLL/SLL is typically per either the modified Rai or Binet 
staging system. 
CLL/SLL is considered a treatable but essentially incurable disease.

EMA/CHMP/896488/2022

Management 
Until recently, the treatment of CLL/SLL was based on chemotherapy, particularly the alkylating agents 
chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, and more recently, bendamustine. In the 1990s, the purine analogue 
fludarabine  was  shown  in  clinical  trials  to  improve  progression-free  survival  (PFS)  compared  to 
chlorambucil,  except  for  elderly  CLL/SLL  patients,  and  became  a  standard  initial  therapy  in  younger 
patients  with  CLL/SLL.  The  addition  of  anti-CD20  antibodies,  such  as  rituximab,  to  chemotherapy 
resulted  in  significant  improvements  in  the  clinical  outcomes  of  previously  untreated  CLL.  Treatment 
standards  for  CLL/SLL  have  evolved  since  the  advent  of  effective  inhibitors  of  B-cell  receptor  (BCR) 
signaling, allowing for several choices of treatment regimens and single-agent therapies for the general 
population of both treatment-naïve (TN) and previously treated CLL/SLL. 
Treatment  options 
for  CLL/SLL  patients 
include  multiagent  chemoimmunotherapy,  such  as 
fludarabine/cyclophosphamide/rituximab  (FCR),  bendamustine/rituximab  (B+R),  and  chlorambucil/ 
obinutuzumab (Cl+O). Such treatments, however, are less effective in patients with high-risk disease; 
furthermore,  many  patients  cannot  tolerate  multiagent  chemoimmunotherapy  due  to  age  and 
comorbidities. Other treatment options include BTK inhibitors such as ibrutinib or acalabrutinib and PI3K 
inhibitors  such  as  idelalisib;  however,  these  treatments  also  have  significant  toxicities,  such  as  atrial 
fibrillation for ibrutinib and colitis for PI3K inhibitors, which limit tolerability and may lead to treatment 
discontinuation. Front-line treatment recommendations as per European Society for Medical Oncology 
(ESMO) guidelines are summarized below.

Second-line  CLL/SLL  treatment  is  guided  by  the  duration  of  the  first  remission  for  relapsed  disease. 
Refractory disease is defined as having either no response to treatment or relapse within 6 months after 
the last treatment. ESMO guidelines recommend a change of therapeutic regimen in case of symptomatic 
relapse within 3 years, or refractory disease, in which case treatment with venetoclax (+/- rituximab), 
ibrutinib,  acalabrutinib,  or  other  BTKi  monotherapy  should  be  considered.  Patients  with  remissions  of 
more than 3 years may be re-exposed to the same time-limited regimen; however, repetition of the FCR 
regimen  is  not  recommended.  Other  treatment  options  include  acalabrutinib,  ibrutinib,  venetoclax  + 
rituximab,  or  idelalisib  +  rituximab.  For  patients  with  TP53  mutation  or  del(17p),  allogenic  stem-cell 
transplantation should be considered for fit patients. The US NCCN guidelines’ list of preferred regimens 
for  RR  CLL/SLL  patients  are  the  same  as  for  frontline  treatment  except  venetoclax  monotherapy  is 
recommended only for patients with TP53 mutation or del(17p).

Zanubrutinib is a potent and irreversible next-generation BTK inhibitor. Zanubrutinib is more selective 
than  ibrutinib  for  BTK  inhibition.  Zanubrutinib  has  been  studied  in  an  extensive  ongoing  clinical 
development program in a number of B-cell malignancies.  
The development programme/compliance with CHMP guidance/scientific 
advice 
The overall study design features for study 304 (1L CLL) were agreed upon with EMA in the context of 
the EMA Scientific Advice EMEA/H/SA/3376/1/2016/II and in a follow up 
EMEA/H/SA/3376/1/FU/1/2017/II although the interim analysis was discouraged. Initially, the MAH 
proposed one pivotal study to support the use of zanubrutinib in treatment-naïve (TN) and R/R CLL 
patients. However, the CHMP did not support this proposal and expressed several concerns regarding 
the design and power of the study to support the claimed indication. In the follow-up advice in 2017 
the MAH proposed study 304 in TN patients. For study 304 the proposed study design and primary 
endpoint (PFS by IRC) were endorsed by the CHMP. The MAH changed the originally proposed study 
design in patients with R/R CLL without further interaction with the CHMP (primary endpoint of PFS 
was changed to ORR. 
2.2  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the  CHMP.  An  environmental  risk  assessment  (ERA)  in  the  course  of  the  initial  MAA  for  treatment  of 
Waldenström  macroglobulinemia  (WM)  is  ongoing,  and  BeiGene  committed  to  provide  the  final  ERA 
report  by  December  2022.  This  summary  was  written  to  support  the  type  II  variation  application  of 
zanubrutinib for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed/refractory marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) 
and the current type II variation on CLL. 
Introduction 
In relation to the initial MAA, a Phase 1 environmental risk assessment was performed: 
The logKOW value of zanubrutinib is below 4.5 (i.e., 3.2 at pH 5, 3.6 at pH 7 and 3.7 at pH 9). Since, Log 
KOW > 3, bioconcentration factor (BCF) in fish study (OECD 305) is triggered.

The Phase I PECSURFACEWATER of zanubrutinib (0.022 μg/L) was above the action limit of 0.01 μg/L using 
an Fpen of 0.00014, which was based on prevalence of Waldenström’s macroglobulinemia of 1.4 per 1000 
as  stated  in  the  orphan  designation  application.  Furthermore,  as  there  are  no  indications  that 
zanubrutinib affects reproduction of vertebrate organisms at low exposure levels, the MAH committed to 
perform a standard Phase II environmental fate and effects assessment. 
Some of these studies were submitted with this variation. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Summary of ongoing Environment Risk Assessment program for MZL 
The Phase I and Phase II Tier A assessments except for the fish early life stage toxicity test (OECD 210) 
were completed, which triggered Phase II Tier B assessment for sediment and bioaccumulation, which 
has been initiated.  
All studies were conducted in accordance with organization for economic cooperation (OECD) guidelines 
and in compliance with the OECD principles of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP). The main study results

Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
 The ERA assessment leaded to the conclusions below: 
1. 
Log KOW > 3, hence a bioconcentration factor (BCF) in fish study (OECD 305) is triggered. This 
study is ongoing. 
However,  the  fish  tissues  were  solubilised  by  Solvable  (Perkin  Elmer)  and  bleached  by  hydrogen 
peroxide (30%). This procedure was probably used for de-colouring of the bilirubin content of the 
fish tissues. Unfortunately, oxidation of the parent or even a loss of the label due to the formation 
of 14CO2 cannot be ruled out. BCF data could be strongly underestimated and would also explain 
the low recovery in the fish samples. 
Further,  the  applicant  stopped  the  uptake  phase  after  28  d  (despite  an  >20%  increase  of  tissue 
concentration)  and  waived  the  depuration  phase  of  the  study.  An  extended  uptake  and/or  a 
depuration phase could have given further information about the kinetics and quality assessment of 
the BCF data. 
Therefore,  the  applicant  is  asked  to  explain  why  hydrogen  peroxide  was  used  as  bleaching  agent 
after solubilisation, although the 14C parent substance can be subject to strong oxidation and loss 
of the label as 14CO2 is possible. 
Further, the applicant should clarify for what reason the uptake phase wasn’t extended although an 
increase of the tissue concentration >20% (mean measured) was observed.

A new study is expected, if no reasonable explanations for the aspects as shown in the rationale are 
provided (OC). 
Brukinsa is not readily biodegradable (OECD 301B).  
A study based on Technical Guidance OECD 308 was submitted to concluding that a Phase II Tier 
B assessment for sediment is triggered. 
The applicant is asked to extend the evaluation of the water/sediment study to the transformation 
products TP-1 and TP-3. Both TPs accumulate in the course of the study in sediment and have, 
therefore, to be considered as very persistent (CHMP recommendation). 
The applicant is kindly asked to revise the persistence classification of Zanubrutinib in the PBT 
assessment part of the ERA into not persistent. Rationale: In the PBT assessment part of the EPAR 
table Zanubrutinib is wrongly classified as persistent. This classification is based on the results of a 
study according to OECD TG 301B, whereas, the results of the study according to OECD TG 308, 
normalised to 12 °C, are relevant for the classification. Since the provided study according to 
OECD TG 308 indicates that Zanubrutinib is not persistent, the classification should be changed, 
but the formation of persistent transformation products could be mentioned (CHMP 
recommendation).

Brukinsa is not a risk to microbial communities (OECD 209), algae (OECD 201) or daphnia (OECD 
211), however a Fish early life cycle test did not provide a NOEC for larval growth of the fathead 
minnow  (NOEC<0.017  mg/L,  OECD  210).  A  new  study  is  planned  to be  completed December 
2022. 
4. 
In support of a Phase II Tier B assessment, a sediment-water Chironomid toxicity test (OECD 
218)  is submitted. At 289 mg/kg d.w. sediment emergence of midges was 5% of control. 
NOEC was 89 mg/kg d.w. 
However, the data are missing in the study report. According to the guideline OECD 218 these data 
have  to  be  submitted.  In  order  to  evaluate  whether  no  significant  difference  exists  between 
emergence of males and females the numbers of emerged males and females per vessel and per 
day  should  be  provided.  Without  this  information  cumulative  emergence  as  sole  result  cannot  be 
used. 
The applicant is asked to provide details on the sex ratio of the Sediment-Water Chironomid Toxicity 
Test  (OECD  218).  Although  it  was  indicated  that  sex  and  number  of  emerged  midges  had  been 
recorded according to the test protocol, the respective results on the sex ratio had not been included 
in  the  study  results.  Therefore,  separate  number  of  emerged  male  and  female  midges  should  be 
provided (numbers of emerged males and females per vessel and per day). 
In  addition,  the  information  on  LOQ  and  LOD  of  the  analysis  are  missing.  These  should  also  be 
submitted (CHMP recommendation). 
The MAH has accepted the CHMP recommendations and a final environmental risk assessment is awaited 
post-approval. This should include the last ongoing study, adequate response to OCs and an updated 
PECSURFACEWATER with the new indication. 
Assessment of paediatric data on non-clinical aspects 
The  MAH  was  granted  a  deferral  and  a  waiver  in  children  below  18  years  of  age  in  treatment  of 
lymphoplasmacytic  lymphoma  and  1  year  of  age  for  treatment  of  mature  B-cell  neoplasms  on  the

grounds that these two diseases do not occur in the respective paediatric subsets of the population, in 
October 2019. At that time, the paediatric investigation plan was planned to be completed by 2026. In 
vitro and in vivo nonclinical studies investigating efficacy of zanubrutinib in paediatric B-cell tumour cell 
lines were deferred.  
In the most recent PIP compliance check report (outcome 15 October 2021), the non-clinical studies 
were referred and assessed by the PDCO; the PIP was deemed compliant and no further non-clinical 
studies were required. 
Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The environmental risk assessment is still ongoing. The final report, including the last study to support 
Phase II tier A assessment and updated PECSURFACEWATER with the new indication, including adequate 
response to outstanding issues, is awaited by the end of 2022/beginning of 2023.

 Studies BGB-3111-304 and BGB-3111-305 
Title of Studies 
Study BGB-3111-304: An International, Phase 3, Open-label, Randomized Study of BGB-3111 Compared 
with Bendamustine plus Rituximab in Patients with Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia 
or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma. 
Study  BGB-3111-305:  A  Phase  3,  Randomized  Study  of  Zanubrutinib  (BGB-3111)  Compared  with 
Ibrutinib  in  Patients  with  Relapsed/Refractory  Chronic  Lymphocytic  Leukemia  or  Small  Lymphocytic 
Lymphoma. 
Methods 
Study drug administration 
Study BGB-3111-304:  
The study included approximately 450 patients in Cohort 1 without the 17p deletion (del(17p)) mutation 
and approximately 80 additional patients from Chinese sites in Cohort 1a to support further analysis in 
the Chinese population. 
Central randomization (1:1) was used to assign patients in Cohort 1/1a to one of the following study 
drug treatments: 
• Arm A: zanubrutinib 
• Arm B: bendamustine + rituximab (B+R) 
There are 2 additional cohorts in the study which were not randomized: Cohort 2/Arm C (with del17p), 
with  approximately  100  planned  patients,  and  Cohort  3/Arm  D  (zanubrutinib  in  combination  with 
venetoclax),  with  approximately  80  planned  patients.  Cohort  3  data  are  not  included  [in  the  current 
submission].  
In all cohorts, zanubrutinib was administered orally at 160 mg twice daily. 
Study BGB-3111-305: 
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 manner to one of the following treatment arms: 
• Arm A: Zanubrutinib 160 mg orally twice daily 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/896488/2022  
Page 15/181 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• Arm B: Ibrutinib 420 mg orally once daily 
The study was planned to enroll approximately 600 patients. 
Sampling 
Study BGB-3111-304:  
Sparse pharmacokinetic (PK) samples to assess zanubrutinib plasma concentrations were collected from 
all patients assigned to Arm A (Cohort 1/1a) and Arm C prior to dosing (within 30 minutes of dosing), 2 
hours (± 30 minutes) after dosing on Day 1 of Cycle 1 and Cycle 2 (each cycle is 28 days or 4 weeks).  
Study BGB-3111-305: 
Sparse PK samples were collected from all patients assigned to Arm A (zanubrutinib) on Cycle 1 Day 1 
predose (within 30 min prior to the morning dose), 2 hours postdose (± 30 minutes), and before patient 
discharge (4-6 hours post-dose); and predose (within 30 min prior to the morning dose) on Cycle 3 Day 
1 and Cycle 4 Day 1. (1 cycle = 28 days). 
Bioanalytical methods 
Plasma samples were analyzed using a validated liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry 
method for the determination of zanubrutinib in K2EDTA human plasma. The lower limit of quantitation 
was 1.0 ng/mL. The updated performance of the bioanalytical method for determination of 
Zanubrutinib concentrations in Study BGB-3111-112, Study BGB-3111-304, and Study BGB-3111-305 
is assessed. 
Population PK analyses 
PopPK  analysis  was  performed  using  nonlinear  mixed  effects  modelling  in  NONMEM  7,  Version  7.4.3,  
Perl-Speaks-NONMEM (PsN) Version 4.2 and R 4.1.0 or above. Population PK estimation was performed 
using the first-order conditional estimation with interaction (FOCEI) method in NONMEM. 
A population PK model for zanubrutinib has previously been developed and validated based on data from 
632 subjects enrolled in 9 clinical studies (BGB-3111-103, BGB-3111-104, BGB-3111-105, BGB-3111-
106,  BGB-3111-AU-003,  BGB-3111-1002,  BGB-3111-205,  BGB-3111-206,  and  BGB-3111-302).  The 
previous  model  was  a  two-compartment  model  with  sequential  zero-order  then  first-order  absorption 
and  first-order  elimination.  The  previous  model  was  updated  with  sparse  data  (data  cut-off  21  June 
2021) from two Phase 3 studies (BGB-3111-304 and BGB-3111-305) in patients with chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia/small  lymphocytic  lymphoma  (CLL/SLL)  following  160  mg  BID  zanubrutinib.  The  previous 
covariate relationships impacting the PK of zanubrutinib were re-assessed. Observations with |CWRES| 
>5 were considered as outliers and excluded from the PK analysis dataset. A total of 6500 samples from 
1291 subjects were included in the updated Pop PK analysis. Studies 304 and 305 contributed with 1044 
and 534 data points from 389 and 271 subjects respectively, where 44 data points were excluded from 
study 304 and 457 data points (mainly due to missing dosing time) were excluded from study 305.

Testing of covariates one-at-a-time using a stepwise forward addition showed that effect of health status, 
age, race, and ALT on CL/F and age on Vc/F were significant (p<0.01). Race on CL/F was removed in 
the backward elimination process (p<0.001).

 Covariate effects 
A summary of key population PK parameters and covariate effects is presented in Table 2. Interindividual 
variability (% coefficient of variation, CV) on CL/F, Vc/F, Q/F, Vp/F, and D1 were 37.0%, 55.1%, 123%, 
70.0%, and 55.2%, respectively. The geometric mean elimination half-life (t½) was 2.52 hours with a 
CV of 47.6%.

Table 3: Key Population PK Parameters and Covariate Effects for Representative Subjects
Baseline body weight, sex, race, AST, bilirubin, CrCL, tumor type, and use of acid-reducing agents did 
not show statistically significant impact on the PK of zanubrutinib. Health status, baseline ALT, and age 
were found to be statistically significant covariates on CL/F. Age was identified as a significant covariate 
on  Vc/F.  
The covariate sensitivity analysis (Figure 6) showed that predicted steady-state Cmax (Cmax,ss) and AUC 
over the 12-hour dosing interval (AUCss) after repeated-dose administration of 160 mg were 297 ng/mL 
and 1110 ng•h/mL in a typical patient. This corresponds to a total daily AUCss of 2220 ng*hr/mL. The 
model predicted geometric mean AUCss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss after repeat-dose administration of 320 
mg  QD  were  2220  ng*hr/mL,  580  ng/mL,  and  5.81  ng/mL,  respectively  in  patients  with  B-Cell 
malignancies.  This  analysis  also  indicated  that  health  status  (patients  versus  HVs)  was  the  most 
influential covariate on the PK of zanubrutinib. The impact of health status on zanubrutinib CL/F resulted 
in a 61.2% higher AUCss and a 41.2% higher Cmax,ss in HVs compared to patients with B-cell malignancies. 
Of note, a total of 90 HVs were included in this analysis. This result of higher exposures in HVs estimated 
by the population PK model is consistent with observed clinical data in healthy subjects versus patients 
based on cross-study comparisons. The impact of ALT and age on zanubrutinib exposure was relatively 
small  compared  with  the  overall  variability  of  the  population,  and  therefore,  ALT  and  age  are  not 
considered to be clinically meaningful covariates.

Exposure-response analyses 
Exposure metrics: 
The  final  population  pharmacokinetic  model  for  CLL  was  applied  to  predict  zanubrutinib  exposure. 
Zanubrutinib plasma concentration time profiles were simulated using the Bayesian post hoc individual 
PK parameters. Derived exposure metrics were: AUCss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss. 
Efficacy: 
In Study BGB-3111-304, efficacy endpoints were PFS (primary) and ORR (secondary). PFS was assessed 
by IRC and defined as the length of time from randomization until disease progression or death. In Study 
BGB-3111-305, the primary endpoint was ORR (PR or higher). ORR was determined by IRC and defined 
as the proportion of patients who achieved a PR or CR. The ORR (PR-L or higher) was also explored as 
a secondary efficacy endpoint for BGB-3111-305. The E-R relationships for efficacy endpoints of ORR 
(PR  or  higher)  and  ORR  (PR-L  or  higher)  were  explored  separately  and  conducted  based  on  the  data 
from patients: 
• patients without del17p (Arm A) in Study BGB-3111-304 (n=278) 
• patients with del17p (Arm C) in Study BGB-3111-304 (n=110) 
• patients in Study BGB-3111-305 (n=173) 
Plots of Kaplan-Meier PFS curves stratified by quartiles of model-predicted AUCss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss 
suggested that  PFS  was  not  different  among  zanubrutinib  exposure  quartiles based  on  the  data  from 
388 patients in Study BGB-3111-304. There was no apparent relationship between PFS and any of the 
zanubrutinib  exposure  metrics  in  the  zanubrutinib  treated  patients  in  Study  BGB-3111-304.  The 
probability  of  response  plots  and  logistic  regression  models  for  ORR  (PR  or  higher)  or  ORR  (PR-L  or 
higher) indicated none of the zanubrutinib exposure metrics had a significant effect on E-R relationship 
for these endpoints (p>0.01). 
Safety: 
A total of 660 patients from studies BGB-3111-304 (n=389) and BGB-311-305 (n=271) were included 
in  the  pooled  exposure  safety  analyses.  The  E–R  relationship  was  assessed  between  zanubrutinib 
exposure  metrics  (AUCss,  Cmax,ss,  and  Cmin,ss)  and  safety  endpoints,  including  AEs  leading  to 
treatment  discontinuation  and  AEs  of  interest  (grade  ≥3  neutropenia,  thrombocytopenia,  anemia, 
infections/infestations, secondary primary malignancies, atrial fibrillation/flutter, major bleeding events, 
and any bleeding events). 
The exposure ranges appeared to be similar in patients who experienced AEs of interest relative to those 
who were not based on 660 patients from studies BGB-3111-304 (n=389) and BGB-3111-305 (n=271). 
The probability of response plots and logistic regression models showed that there were no evident E–R 
relationships between exposure metrics (AUCss, Cmax,ss, or Cmin,ss) and the probability of occurrence 
of safety measures.

Absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion 
In the initial MAA (the WM indication), the ADME characteristics of zanubrutinib were documented. 
There is no reason to believe that the ADME characteristics should be significantly different in patients 
with CLL/SLL. Accordingly, the Applicant’s proposed changes to SmPC section 5.2 are limited to 
revisions reflecting the characteristics of the 1291 subjects included in the current submission’s 
updated PopPK analysis. This is endorsed.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality and time dependency of PK parameters were addressed in the initial WM 
application: Cmax and AUC0-∞ appeared to increase dose-proportionally after single-dose oral 
administration of zanubrutinib from 40 mg to 320 mg in patients with B-cell malignancies.  The present 
application concerns the same proposed dose regimen (a 320 mg total daily dose administered as 160 
mg twice daily or 320 mg once daily), and the dose proportionality and PK time dependency are not 
expected to differ from the previously approved WM indication.    
Dose justification 
The proposed dose regimen in patients with CLL/SLL is a 320 mg total daily dose (administered as 160 
mg twice daily or 320 mg once daily). This is based on the totality of safety, efficacy, PK and 
pharmacodynamics (BTK occupancy data) results from studies BGB-3111-AU-003, BGB-3111-205, 
BGB-3111-304, and BGB-3111-305. 
In Study BGB-3111-AU-003 at dose regimens of 40, 80, 160 and 320 mg once daily and 160 mg twice 
daily, the maximum tolerated dose was not reached, and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed 
during the dose-escalation part of the study. Moreover, nearly full occupancy of BTK in peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) was achieved in patients at all administered doses. The BTK 
occupancy in lymph node tissue was assessed at 160 mg twice daily and 320 mg once daily. At the 
160 mg twice daily dose, the median BTK occupancy of 100% was observed at steady-state trough 
and 94% in the 320 mg once daily group. To maximize the inhibition in target tissue, the 160 mg twice 
daily dose has been used in studies BGB-3111-304 and BGB-3111-305, as well as other ongoing Phase 
2/3 studies. The results of pivotal Phase 3 studies BGB-3111-304 and BGB-3111-305 provided the 
primary evidence of effectiveness in patients with CLL/SLL and supported the proposed zanubrutinib 
dose of 160 mg twice daily. 
In study BGB-3111-AU-003, the overall response rate was 100% (N = 40/40) for the 320 mg once 
daily dose compared to 92.8% (N = 77/83) for the 160 mg twice daily dose. The CR rate was 22.5 % 
(N=9/40) for the 320 mg once daily dose compared to 13.3% (N = 11/83) for the 160 mg twice daily 
dose. Although the number of CLL/SLL patients treated at 320 mg once daily (N=40) is limited relative 
to those at 160 mg twice daily dose (N=83), the totality of data, including pharmacokinetic, 
pharmacodynamic, safety, efficacy, and exposure–response analyses, provided support for the 
recommended 320-mg total daily dose for patients with CLL/SLL. Objective responses have been 
observed in patients with various B-cell malignancies (including CLL/SLL, MCL, WM, MZL, and FL) at all 
tested dose levels from 40 mg to 320 mg. Numerically comparable overall response rates have also 
been observed between the once daily and twice daily regimens in patients with MCL and WM (Tam, et 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/896488/2022  
Page 24/181 
 
 
 
 
 
 
al 2021). Furthermore, no remarkable difference in AEs between the 2 regimens in the safety 
population in study BGB-3111-AU-003 were observed (Ou et al 2021). 
Additional data support a 320 mg once daily regimen as an option in addition to the 160 mg twice daily 
regimen for patients with CLL/SLL. Given the same total daily dose (320 mg) and linear PK, similar 
exposures/AUC are achieved between the 320 mg once daily and 160 mg twice daily dose. At the 320 
mg once daily dose, a sustained and profound BTK inhibition in PBMC and lymph node tissue were also 
observed. E-R analyses indicated that there was no evident E-R relationship between exposure (AUC0-
24,ss, Cmax,ss, or Cmin,ss) and safety endpoints (AEs of interests) in patients with B-cell malignancies 
(Report BGB-3111-CP-007) and in patients with CLL/SLL (Report BGB-3111-CP-011). There were no 
significant relationships between zanubrutinib exposure and AEs including cytopenias, infections, and 
bleeding. In addition, the E-R analysis in patients with CLL/SLL (Report BGB-3111-CP-011) and other 
B-cell malignancies including MCL (Report BGB-3111-CP-003), WM (Report BGB-3111-CP-007), and 
MZL (Report BGB-3111-CP-009) indicated that efficacy (ORR) does not appear to be significantly 
impacted by Cmax or Cmin, and therefore the same total daily dose and corresponding AUC delivered by 
a 320 mg once daily regimen are expected to result in a similar ORR as that of the 160 mg twice daily 
regimen. 
The totality of the data summarized here thus support the recommended dose of a 320 mg total daily 
dose (as 160 mg twice daily or 320 mg once daily) in adult patients with CLL/SLL. This is based on 
consistent and sustained BTK occupancy in PBMCs and target tissue, high rates of overall response in 
patients with CLL/SLL, and a favorable safety and tolerability profile.

• Day 1: Single oral dose of 320 mg zanubrutinib after an overnight fast of 8 to 10 hours 
• Days 3 to 10: Oral dose of 300 mg rifabutin once daily (QD) with food (standard meal) 
• Day 11: Single oral dose of 320 mg zanubrutinib and QD dose of 300 mg rifabutin after an 
overnight fast of 8 to 10 hours. 
Sampling 
On PK sampling days (Days 1 and 11), blood samples for analysis of plasma zanubrutinib were 
collected predose and 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 36 hours postdose. The allowed sampling 
windows for PK blood samples were as follows: within 15 minutes prior to dosing for the predose 
sample timepoint; ± 5 minutes for sampling timepoints ≤12 hours; ± 30 minutes for sampling 
timepoint at 24 and 36 hours. 
Results 
A total of 13 subjects were enrolled and were evaluable for PK analysis. 
Following the administration of 320 mg zanubrutinib alone on Day 1 and the coadministration with 300 
mg rifabutin on Day 11, median times of the maximum observed plasma concentration (tmax) of 1.50 
and 2.00 hours postdose were observed, respectively (Figure 8). Systemic exposure to zanubrutinib 
was lower following the coadministration of 320 mg zanubrutinib with 300 mg rifabutin compared to 
the administration of 320 mg zanubrutinib alone, with a geometric mean area under the plasma 
concentration time curve (AUC) approximately 44% lower and maximum observed plasma 
concentration (Cmax) 48% lower (Table 1). This represented a decreased exposure of 1.8-fold for AUC0-
t and AUC0-∞, and 1.9-fold for Cmax when zanubrutinib was administered with a moderate CYP3A 
inducer.

Table 4: Study BGB-3111-112: Statistical Analysis of Pharmacokinetic Parameters of 
Zanubrutinib After Administration of 320 mg Zanubrutinib Alone and After Coadministration 
With 300 mg Rifabutin 
There was a less than a 50% reduction of systemic exposures (AUC) of zanubrutinib following co-
administration of zanubrutinib with rifabutin, a moderate CYP3A inducer, compared to administration of 
zanubrutinib alone. Thus, based on the emergent data from Study BGB-3111-112, a revision to the 
current dose recommendation for concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducers is proposed; it is 
recommended that patients use caution with concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducers. This 
updated recommendation is based on the totality of data, including (1) less than 50% decrease in 
zanubrutinib AUC for concurrent use of a moderate CYP3A inducer, (2) an efficacy signal at doses as 
low as 40 and 80 mg (BGB-3111-AU-003 CSR), (3) maximal BTK inhibition (median BTK occupancy of 
100%) in PBMC samples starting at doses of 40 mg once a day, and (5) no identifiable E-R 
relationships for efficacy or safety endpoints.

Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Zanubrutinib is a next-generation, potent BTK inhibitor. Like other active BTK inhibitors, zanubrutinib 
forms an irreversible covalent bond at Cys481 within the adenosine triphosphate binding pocket of the 
BTK protein. 
Primary pharmacology 
No new pharmacodynamic analyses pertaining to BTK occupancy have been conducted since the initial 
WM application. For the latter, “Pharmacodynamic (PD) analyses were performed in the Chinese phase 
1 study BGB-3111-1002 and in the global phase 1/2 study BGB-3111-AU-003 based on PD data from 
13 and 50 subjects, respectively. The primary PD endpoint was the BTK occupancy in peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs)”.  
The number of lymph node samples included was low, 12 and 18 samples in patients with 320 mg QD 
and 160 mg BID dosing, respectively.  As per Figure 3 below, from the Applicant’s previously 
submitted Report BGB-3111-AU-003-PD-01, although data was very limited, there was no apparent 
association of lymph node BTK occupancy and tumour types, including CLL:

PK/PD modelling 
To support dose recommendations, exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety relationships were 
evaluated in patients with CLL/SLL receiving zanubrutinib monotherapy in studies BGB-3111-304 and 
BGB-3111-305. The exposure-response (E-R) analysis for efficacy was conducted separately for BGB-
3111-304 in patients with TN CLL/SLL and BGB 3111 305 in patients with R/R CLL/SLL. E-R analysis 
also included patients with CLL/SLL for the pooled exposure-safety analysis (Report BGB-3111-CP-011, 
N=660). 
The exposure for zanubrutinib was summarized as cumulative steady state AUC over 24 hours (AUC0-
24,ss), Cmax,ss, or Cmin,ss. Exposure data (AUC0-24,ss, Cmax,ss, or Cmin,ss) derived from the population PK 
analysis (Report BGB-3111-CP-010) were used in the analysis. Analyses were performed using data 
from all patients who had ≥ 1 set of the estimated PK parameters. Individual PK parameters from 
these studies were merged with the corresponding efficacy or safety data from studies BGB-3111-304 
and BGB-3111-305 (Report BGB-3111-CP-011). In both studies, zanubrutinib was administered orally 
as a 160 mg BID regimen. 
Exposure-Efficacy Relationship – Study BGB-3111-304 
Data from BGB-3111-304 Arm A, in patients with CLL/SLL without del17p (N=278 with PK) and in Arm 
C, with del17p (N=110 with PK) were included in the E-R analysis of efficacy outcomes. The efficacy in 
patients with CLL/SLL was investigated with the responder group including patients with best overall 
response of complete response (CR), partial response (PR) or higher, and partial response with 
lymphocytosis (PR-L) or higher; the non-responder group included patients with best overall response 
of stable disease and progressive disease. 
Exposure-Response Relationship for Efficacy in Patients with TN CLL/SLL (without del17p) -
ORR Assessed by IRC (PR-L or higher) 
Box plots of zanubrutinib exposure by IRC-assessed objective response (PR-L or higher) of CLL/SLL 
patients in Arm A, without del17p, are presented in Figure 4. Although a range of exposures was 
observed in both responders and non-responders, the median AUC0-24,ss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss values were 
similar in responders compared with those of non-responders. The probability of ORR (defined as the 
proportion of subjects who achieve CR + PR) by quantiles of zanubrutinib exposure is shown in Figure 
5. Based on visual inspection of exploratory plots, the E-R logistic regression model for IRC-assessed 
ORR with Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss, and AUC0-24,ss was developed and the diagnostic plots of the model are 
presented in Figure 6. The results of the logistic regression model confirmed that Cmax,ss, Cmin,ss, and 
AUC0-24,ss were not associated with the probability of ORR in patients with TN CLL/SLL without del17p 
(p-value >0.1). Overall, there was no apparent E-R relationship for zanubrutinib based on response 
assessments of ORR (PR-L or higher).

Exposure-Safety Relationship 
Exposure-safety analyses were performed using pooled data from 2 studies (BGB-3111-304 and BGB-
3111-305). A total of 660 patients were included in the exposure-safety analyses (Report BGB-3111-
CP-011). E-R relationships were assessed between zanubrutinib exposure metrics (model predicted 
Cmin,ss, Cmax,ss and AUC0-24,ss) and adverse events (AE) of interest (Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia, Grade ≥ 3 
thrombocytopenia, Grade ≥ 3 anemia, Grade ≥ 3 infections/infestations, all events of secondary 
primary malignancies, all events of atrial fibrillation and flutter, major bleeding events, any bleeding 
events and AEs leading to treatment discontinuation). The summary of the safety endpoints is shown 
below.

The analysis showed that there were no evident E-R relationships between exposure (AUC0-24,ss, Cmax,ss, 
or Cmin,ss) and the probability to have AEs of interest examined. The exposure ranges appeared to be 
similar in patients experiencing AEs of interest relative to those who were not. Plots showing a 
probability of Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia versus steady-state exposures (Cmax,ss, AUC0-24,ss, and Cmin,ss) are 
shown in Figure 13. Similarly, no evident E-R relationships were observed for other safety endpoints, 
including Grade ≥ 3 neutropenia, Grade ≥ 3 thrombocytopenia, Grade ≥ 3 anemia, Grade ≥ 3 
infections/infestations, all events of secondary primary malignancies, all events of atrial fibrillation and

Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Zanubrutinib is a Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor approved in the EU for treatment of adult 
patients with Waldenström’s macroglobulinaemia (WM) who have received at least one prior therapy, 
or in first line treatment for patients unsuitable for chemo-immunotherapy. 
The present application concerns approval of zanubrutinib as monotherapy for treatment of adult 
patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). The current 
application’s clinical pharmacology package includes data from a Phase 3, open-label study of 
zanubrutinib in patients with previously untreated CLL/SLL (Study BGB-3111-304), a Phase 3, open-
label study of zanubrutinib in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL (BGB-3111-305) and a clinical 
DDI study (BGB-3111-112). 
No new bioanalytical methods were applied for detection of zanubrutinib. A previous Pop PK model, a 
two-compartment model with sequential zero-order then first-order absorption and first-order 
elimination, was updated with data from studies 304 and 305 to characterise the PK of zanubrutinib in 
CLL/SLL patients.  
All  patients  with  CLL/SLL  from  studies  BGB-3111-304  and  BGB-3111-305  were  exposed  to  an  initial 
zanubrutinib dose of 160 mg twice daily. The justification for the dose selection relies on data submitted 
with the initial WM application, including analyses of PK, BTK receptor occupancy in PBMCs and lymph 
node biopsies, and exposure-response for safety and efficacy. Multiple cohorts of patients with various 
B-cell  malignancies  including  CLL/SLL  comprised  the  clinical  populations  studied  in  the  initial  WM 
Assessment report

Page 41/181 
 
 
 
 
 
application; Their demographic characteristics were comparable to those expected for adult patients with 
CLL/SLL. The rationale of the dose selection is overall acceptable. 
No relation to exposure was found for either efficacy or safety endpoints in the CLL/SLL patient 
population.  
The ADME characteristics were described in the original WM marketing application, and the Applicant’s 
proposed changes to SmPC section 5.2 are limited to revisions reflecting the characteristics of the 
1291 subjects included in the current submission’s updated PopPK analysis. Based on the efficacy, 
safety and PK results observed, the selected dose regimen of 320 mg total daily dose, identical to the 
currently approved posology for WM (administered as 160 mg twice daily or 320 mg once daily) is 
considered acceptable.  
As part of the current MAA package, the MAH has submitted a clinical DDI study (BGB-3111-112) of 
zanubrutinib co-administered with the moderate CYP3A inducer rifabutin. Rifabutin was found to 
decrease average zanubrutinib exposure by nearly half, with a geometric mean AUC approximately 
44% lower and Cmax 48% lower. Based on these results, the MAH proposes to revise the current SmPC 
recommendation to avoid concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducers, suggesting that moderate 
CYP3A inducers may instead “be used with caution” during zanubrutinib treatment. However, results of 
Study BGB-3111-112 became available and were assessed during the initial Brukinsa EU MAA, no new 
clinical efficacy data has been provided by the MAH pertaining to zanubrutinib dosing regimens starting 
below 320 mg daily, and data on BTK receptor occupancy in target tissues below the current 
recommended total daily dose of 320 mg are likewise lacking. The lack of observable exposure-
response and exposure-safety relationships is also used as one argument to justify that no dose 
adjustments are needed in the presence of moderate CYP3A4 inducers. This argument is not fully 
agreed by the CHMP. While it is agreed on the basis of the plots for probability of IRC-assessed 
objective response vs. exposure in studies 304 + 305 that a 50% reduction in exposure in the median 
patient would not likely result in appreciable change in probability of response, no predictions can be 
made on the basis of the model for the effect of 50% exposure reduction in patients who are on the 
lower end of the exposure range. Hence, the concern that average decreased zanubrutinib exposure in 
the order of 50% may result in decreased efficacy remains. Accordingly, changes to SmPC 
recommendations regarding co-administration of zanubrutinib with moderate CYP3A inducers with the 
addition of the CLL/SLL indication were not supported; the currently approved wording to avoid 
concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducers has remained in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacology package included in the current application includes data from a Phase 3, open-label 
study of zanubrutinib in patients with previously untreated CLL/SLL (Study BGB-3111-304), a Phase 3, 
open-label study of zanubrutinib in patients with relapsed/refractory CLL/SLL (BGB-3111-305) and a 
clinical DDI study (BGB-3111-112). Based on data submitted with the initial (WM) EU MAA, the two 
proposed dose regimens, 160 mg twice daily and 320 mg once daily, were found to give comparable 
exposure (AUC), and the same posology for the CLL/SLL indication is considered acceptable based on 
the efficacy, safety and PK results provided with the current application.  
The exposure-response analyses provide support that zanubrutinib efficacy in the median patient is 
unlikely to be compromised in the presence of moderate CYP3A4 inducers. However, no reliable 
predictions from the exposure-response model can be made for those patients who are on the lower 
end of the exposure range resulting from 160 mg BID or 320 mg QD dose, hence the currently 
approved SmPC wordings to avoid concomitant use of moderate CYP3A inducers still remain.

Treatments 
BGB-3111-304 
Each treatment cycle consists of approximately 28 days. Patients are treated as follows:  
1.  In Arm A (Cohort 1/1a) and Arm C (Cohort 2), zanubrutinib was administered orally at 160 mg 
twice daily.  
2.  In Arm B (Cohort 1/1a), bendamustine was administered IV at a dose of 90 mg/m2/day on the first 
2 days of each cycle for 6 cycles. Rituximab was administered IV at a dose of 375 mg/m2 for Cycle 
1, and at a dose of 500 mg/m2 for Cycles 2 to 6.  
Patients in Arms A, B, and C remained on study treatment (with a maximum of 6 cycles of B+R in Arm 
B) until unacceptable toxicity or disease progression was confirmed by independent central review. 
Patients in Arm B of Cohort 1/1a may be eligible to receive crossover treatment with zanubrutinib at 
the time of disease progression, confirmed by independent central review. For patients who crossed 
over from Arm B to receive next line zanubrutinib, safety and laboratory assessments were to be 
performed per the zanubrutinib (Arms A and C) Schedule of Assessments and tumor response was to 
be evaluated by the investigator. 
Arm C: Patients assigned to Cohort 2 (Arm C) received zanubrutinib monotherapy 160 mg twice a day 
(two 80-mg capsules twice a day) and were to remain on zanubrutinib until unacceptable toxicity or 
disease progression.

Rituximab 
No dose reductions for rituximab were to be allowed. A 28-day cycle length should be maintained, if 
possible. If rituximab was delayed, then bendamustine should be delayed as well. 
BGB-3111-305 
Zanubrutinib 
Zanubrutinib 160 mg was taken twice a day with or without food.   
On the days of PK blood sampling, study drug administration for patients assigned to Arm A 
(zanubrutinib) occurred at the center under the supervision of the investigator or his/her designee 
after the pre-dose blood sampling had occurred. The investigator or his/her designee instructed the 
patient not to self-administer the study drug prior to the office visit on those days. 
Ibrutinib 
Patients randomized to Arm B received ibrutinib as per the Summary of Product Characteristics at a 
dose of 420 mg orally once daily.   
Dose Interruption and Modification 
Zanubrutinib and ibrutinib treatment modifications applicable to hematologic and nonhematologic 
toxicities are outlined in Table 8. 
Table 8: Zanubrutinib and Ibrutinib Dose Reductions 
Zanubrutinib Dose Modifications for Hematologic Toxicity 
Dosing was held for individual patients under any of the following conditions, based on investigator 
assessment (using Hallek et al 2008) of study drug relatedness: 
1.  Grade 4 neutropenia (that was persistent for at least 10 consecutive days) 
2.  Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (that was persistent for at least 10 consecutive days) 
3.  Grade 3 thrombocytopenia associated with significant bleeding 
4.  ≥ Grade 3 febrile neutropenia 
For the first occurrence of hematologic toxicity, zanubrutinib treatment could restart at full dose upon 
recovery of the toxicity to ≤ Grade 1 or baseline. Dose modification for patients with ≥ Grade 3 
thrombocytopenia associated with significant bleeding requiring medical intervention were discussed 
with the medical monitor.

Zanubrutinib Dose Modifications for nonhematologic toxicity were given in the table below. For patients 
experiencing symptomatic and/or incompletely controlled atrial fibrillation, the study drug could be 
restarted at either the original dose or dose level -1, per discretion of the treating investigator, after 
the atrial fibrillation was adequately controlled. Zanubrutinib was permanently discontinued for any 
intracranial hemorrhage. 
If the HCV RNA was ≥ 15 IU/mL, the HBV DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was ≥ 100 IU/mL, 
or a rechecked detectable copy number was recorded during monthly monitoring, then study drug was 
stopped, and antiviral therapy initiated.

Sample size 
BGB-3111-304 
The sample size calculation for Cohort 1 is based on the primary efficacy analysis of PFS comparison 
between Arms A and B in Cohort 1. Assuming the HR (Arm A/Arm B) in Cohort 1 is 0.58, 118 events 
are required to achieve 83.5% power at 2-sided alpha of 0.05 to reject the null hypothesis, when 1 
interim analysis is planned after 73% of the target number of events at final analysis. If 450 patients 
are enrolled to Cohort 1 and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to Arms A and B over a 25-month period (actual 
patient enrollment up to November 2018 and 28 patients per month enrollment rate after) and the 
hazard rate for drop-out of 0.0017/month, 118 events are expected to be accumulated at 41 months 
from study start. This assumes a median PFS in Arm B of 42 months and that PFS follows exponential 
distribution. Approximately 710 patients will be enrolled, with 450 patients without the del17p 
mutation in Cohort 1 available for the primary efficacy analysis, approximately 80 additional patients 
from Chinese sites without the del17p mutation in Cohort 1a, and approximately 100 patients with the 
del17p mutation in Cohort 2 and approximately 80 patients with del17p or pathogenic TP53 variant in 
Cohort 3. Sample size selection for Cohort 1a was to accumulate enough PFS events among patients 
enrolled from Chinese sites at the final analysis to support more than 80% probability of 
demonstrating an HR < 1 among patients enrolled from Chinese sites if the PFS HR based on the ITT 
Analysis Set crosses the prespecified statistical boundary at the final analysis. 
Sample size selections for Cohorts 2 and 3 were driven by estimated patient availability. 
BGB-3111-305 
The sample size calculation was based on the primary efficacy analysis for the primary endpoint of 
overall response rate. Assuming a response ratio (zanubrutinib arm/ibrutinib arm) of 1.03 (72%/70%), 
600 patients would provide more than 90% power to demonstrate the noninferiority of zanubrutinib to 
ibrutinib at the noninferiority margin of 0.8558 (response ratio) and 1-sided alpha level of 0.025 with 1 
interim analysis at 69% information fraction. The response rate for ibrutinib was approximated from 
published clinical data (Byrd et al 2019). 
The non-inferiority margin was derived using the 95%-95% fixed margin method (FDA Guidance for 
Industry: Non-Inferiority Clinical Trials to Establish Effectiveness 2016). The efficacy of ibrutinib (M1) 
in response ratio scale was estimated as 2.1781 from the results of RESONATE and RESONATE2 trials 
by a fixed-effect meta-analysis. Requiring 80% of M1 to be retained in zanubrutinib, a non-inferiority 
margin of 0.8558 is generated. The margin is within the clinically acceptable limit. 
Assuming a hazard ratio (zanubrutinib arm/ibrutinib arm) of 0.9, 205 events would be required to 
achieve 80% power at a 1-sided alpha of 0.025 to demonstrate the noninferiority of zanubrutinib to 
ibrutinib at the noninferiority margin of 1.3319 (hazard ratio) in PFS. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/896488/2022  
Page 55/181 
 
 
 
If the 600 patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the 2 arms over a 24-month period including a 9-
month ramp-up period before reaching the peak enrollment of 33 patients/month with a 0.0017/month 
hazard rate for drop-out, 205 events were expected to be accumulated in 45 months after study start. 
A median PFS of 47 months for ibrutinib and an exponential distribution for PFS were also assumed. 
Justification of the noninferiority margin for ORR 
A non-inferiority margin of 0.8558 in response ratio was derived using the 95% to 95% fixed margin 
approach (FDA Guidance for Industry Non-Inferiority 2016). In the RESONATE trial (Byrd et al 2014), 
the ibrutinib effect over ofatumumab represented by the ratio of response rate (PR or higher) was 
10.43 with a 95% CI of (5.2, 21.0) based on the independent review committee assessment. Thus, M1 
is 5.2, the lower bound of the 95% CI. Since the effect size of ibrutinib is versus an active control 
(ofatumumab), rather than placebo, the choice of M1 is conservative, and a non-inferiority margin of 
0.8558 (for the response ratio) retains over 90% of M1 (on the log scale). 
Justification of the noninferiority margin for PFS 
A non-inferiority margin of 1.3319 was derived using the 95% to 95% fixed margin approach based on 
the RESONATE study. In the updated RESONATE results (Brown et al 2014), the estimated PFS HR for 
ibrutinib versus ofatumumab was 0.106 with a 95% CI of (0.073, 0.153). Therefore, the control arm 
effect (M1) is 0.153 in HR and -1.877 in log HR. A noninferiority margin of 1.3319 for the HR 
(zanubrutinib/ibrutinib) retains approximately 85% of M1 (on the log scale). 
Randomisation 
BGB-3111-304 
Patients will be randomized using the IRT system for this study by permuted block stratified 
randomization. The stratified randomization will be produced, reviewed, and approved by an 
independent statistician. 
Central randomization (1:1) will be used to assign patients in Cohort 1/1a to one of the following study 
drug treatments: 
1. 
2. 
Arm A: zanubrutinib 
Arm B: bendamustine + rituximab (B+R) 
Randomization will be stratified by age (< 65 years vs ≥ 65 years), Binet stage (C vs A or B), 
immunoglobulin variable region heavy chain (IGHV) mutational status (mutated vs unmutated), and 
geographic region (North America vs Europe vs Asia-Pacific).  
Because Cohort 1a enrolls only patients from Chinese sites, geographic region will not be a 
randomization stratification factor for Cohort 1a. Patients in Cohort 2 (Arm C) will receive treatment 
with zanubrutinib. Patients in Cohort 3 (Arm D) will receive treatment with venetoclax + zanubrutinib. 
BGB-3111-305 
Interactive Response Technology (IRT) was used to randomize patients to treatment arm and to assign 
study drug as applicable. Randomization will be performed as study by permuted block stratified 
randomization. Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 manner to either Arm A (zanubrutinib) or 
Arm B (ibrutinib). Randomization was stratified by age (< 65 years versus ≥ 65 years), geographic 
region (China versus non-China), refractory status (yes or no), and del17p/TP53 mutation status 
(present or absent).

Blinding (masking) 
BGB-3111-304 
Study BGB-3111-304 was open-label. The assessment of PFS for Cohort 1 was performed by an 
independent central review committee. Access to aggregated efficacy summary treatment results was 
not provided before database lock.  
BGB-3111-305 
Treatment with zanubrutinib or ibrutinib was open label since the safety, PK, pharmacodynamics, and 
antitumor effects endpoints in this study were unlikely to be biased by knowledge of the study 
treatment. 
Treatment with zanubrutinib or treatment with ibrutinib was open label; however, the independent 
central review for response assessment was blinded to study treatment. The independent DMC was not 
blinded. However, due to the open-label nature of the study, the sponsor did not have access to 
aggregated data summaries by actual study treatment assignment while the study was ongoing. This 
was done to avoid unwanted bias due to the possibility of inconsistent queries among patients with 
different treatments or overinterpretation of immature accruing data. A Data Integrity Protection Plan 
was put in place to describe the steps taken prior to database lock for the primary analysis of efficacy 
to restrict data access and minimize these potential biases for the study. 
Statistical methods 
BGB-3111-304 
Analysis Populations for Efficacy 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population includes all enrolled patients who are assigned to a treatment 
group. The ITT population will be the primary population for efficacy analyses. 
The Per-Protocol Population includes patients who received any dose of study medication and had no 
major protocol deviations. Criteria for exclusion from the Per-Protocol Population will be determined 
and documented before the database lock for the primary analysis. 
Primary Efficacy Analysis: PFS 
The distribution of PFS, including median PFS and PFS rate at selected timepoints such as 12, 24 and 36 
months,  will  be  summarized  descriptively  using  the  Kaplan-Meier  method  for  each  arm.  The  95% 
confidence interval for median and other quartiles of PFS will be generated by using Brookmeyer method, 
whereas  the  95%  confidence  interval  for  PFS  rate  at  selected  timepoints  will  be  generated  by  using 
Greenwood formula. The primary inferential comparison of PFS 
H0: Hazard ratio (HR) (Arm A/Arm B) = 1 
Ha: HR (Arm A/Arm B) <1 
between treatment groups will use the log-rank test stratified by age (< 65 years vs ≥ 65 years), Binet 
stage  (C  vs  A  or  B),  and  IGHV  mutational  status  (mutated  vs  unmutated)  per  IRT.  The  HR  will  be 
estimated  using  a  stratified  Cox  proportional  hazard  model.  Duration  of  follow-up  for  PFS  will  be 
estimated by reverse Kaplan-Meier method (Schemper and Smith 1996). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/896488/2022  
Page 57/181 
 
 
 
 
For the primary analysis of PFS, the point estimate of the hazard ratio and its 95% CI will be computed 
based  on  fixed  design  procedures  using  a  Cox  model.  The  adequacy  of  the  proportional  hazard 
assumption  will  be  evaluated  by  examining  Schoenfeld  residual  plot  and  Kaplan-Meier  plot.  If  strong 
evidence  of  non-proportionality  of  the  treatment  effect  is  observed,  the  time  axis  will  be  partitioned 
using  the  time  points  suggested  by  the  residual  plot  and  a  piecewise  Cox  model  will  be  fitted  as  a 
sensitivity analysis. 
Censoring rules for PFS 
These conventions are based on December 2018 FDA Guidance for Industry, ‘Clinical Trial Endpoints for 
the Approval of Cancer Drugs and Biologics,’ and December 2012 EMA Appendix 1 to the Guideline on

Sensitivity analyses for PFS 
1. 
PFS Analysis Based on the Per-Protocol Analysis Set: the Per-Protocol Analysis Set instead of 
the ITT analysis set will be used as the analysis population. The analysis method will be the 
same as that for the primary PFS analysis. 
2. 
Initiation of Non-Protocol CLL/SLL Related Therapy Treated as a PFS Event: initiation of non-
protocol CLL/SLL related therapy will be treated as a PFS event whereby PFS is broadly defined 
as duration from randomization to documented disease progression, initiation of non-protocol 
Assessment report

CLL/SLL related therapy, or death, whichever occurs earlier. The data censoring rules were the 
same as those for the primary analysis of PFS except that the use of non-protocol CLL/SLL 
therapy will be treated as an event rather than a mechanism for censoring. The analysis 
method was the same as that for the primary PFS analysis. 
3. 
Initiation of Non-Protocol CLL/SLL Related Therapy Treated as neither a PFS Event nor a 
Censoring Event: In this sensitivity analysis, the use of non-protocol CLL/SLL related therapy 
will be ignored. The data censoring rules are the same as those for the primary analysis of PFS 
except that the initiation of non-protocol CLL/SLL related therapy will be excluded as a 
mechanism for censoring. The analysis method will be the same as that for the primary PFS 
analysis. 
4. 
Death or Disease Progression Immediately After Two or More Missed Consecutive Disease 
Assessments as a PFS Event: death or disease progression immediately after two or more 
missed consecutive disease assessments will be treated as a PFS event. The analysis method 
will be the same as that for the primary PFS analysis. 
5. 
PFS Analysis under a Non-Proportional Hazard Function: If there is a substantial deviation from 
the proportional hazard assumption, a piecewise Cox model will be fitted to model the non-
proportional hazard.  
6. 
7. 
8. 
PFS Analysis based on all Patients Randomized to Cohort 1 and Cohort 1a: the primary PFS 
analysis will be repeated using all patients randomized to Cohort 1 and Cohort 1a. 
Hospitalization due to COVID-19 was treated as a Censoring Event 
PFS Analysis based on Interval Censoring: PD event dates were assumed as interval censored, 
i.e. occurred between date of disease assessment right before PD and date of disease 
assessment with detected PD. A non-parametric method was used to compare the 2 arms with 
the interval censored data (Huang 2008). 
Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Overall Survival (OS) in Cohort 1 
The distribution of OS, including quartiles, will be summarized descriptively using the Kaplan-Meier 
method per each arm. Median follow-up for OS will be estimated according to the Kaplan-Meier 
estimate of potential follow-up also termed “reverse Kaplan-Meier” (Schemper and Smith 1996).  
The inferential comparison of OS 
H0: Hazard ratio (HR) (Arm A/Arm B) = 1 
Ha: HR (Arm A/Arm B) < 1 
between treatment groups will use the log-rank test stratified by age (< 65 years vs ≥ 65 years), 
Binet stage (C vs A or B), and IGHV mutational status (mutated vs unmutated) per IRT. The HR for 
BGB-3111 arm over the BR arm will be estimated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards model. 
The survival rate at selected landmark times (e.g., 1 year, 2 years, and 3 years from randomization) 
will be estimated for each treatment group by the corresponding Kaplan-Meier estimate with its 95% 
confidence interval using Greenwood formula. 
Censoring rules for OS 
Patients who are alive or lost to follow-up as of the data analysis cut-off date will be right censored at 
the patient’s date last known to be alive.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/896488/2022  
Page 59/181 
 
 
 
Sensitivity analyses for OS 
1. 
2. 
The OS result will be assessed using additional sensitivity analyses, all of which will be based 
on the ITT analysis set, including the followings: 
On-Treatment Analysis: Initiation of BGB-3111 in BR Arm Patients Treated as a Censoring 
Event In this sensitivity analysis, initiation of BGB-3111 in BR arm patients will be treated as a 
censoring event. The analysis method remains the same as that for the primary analysis of OS. 
3. 
Estimation Based on Inverse Probability of Censoring Weights (IPCW) Method (Robin and 
Finkelstein 2000) In this analysis, BR arm patients crossed over to receive any BGB-3111 will 
be artificially censored at the time of switch, and remaining BR arm patients will be weighted 
based upon covariate values and a model of the probability of being censored. This allows 
patients who have not been artificially censored to be weighted in order to reflect their 
similarities to patients who have been censored in an attempt to remove the selection bias 
caused by the censoring – patients who did not crossover and have similar characteristics to 
subjects who did cross-over receive higher weights. The IPCW version of Kaplan-Meier 
estimator, log-rank test, and Cox partial likelihood of the HR will be used for the OS analysis. 
The IPCW method will be only considered when more than 20% BR arm patients crossed over 
to receive BGB-3111. 
4. 
Estimation Based on Iterative Parameter Estimation (IPE) Algorithm (Branson and Whitehead 
2002) The IPE procedure is an extension of rank preserving structural failure time model 
(RPSFTM). It uses parametric methods and a counterfactual framework to estimate the causal 
effect of the BGB- 3111 treatment. In this analysis, a parametric accelerated failure time 
model is fitted to the original unadjusted ITT data to obtain an initial estimate of the treatment 
effect. The failure times of BR arm patients who received any BGB-3111 are then re-estimated 
using the model, and this iterative procedure continues until the new estimate is very close to 
the previous estimate, i.e. “converged.” Similar to the analysis based on IPCW method, this 
analysis will be only considered when more than 20% BR arm patients crossed over to use 
BGB-3111. 
Overall response rate (ORR) in Cohort 1 
ORR will be estimated as the crude proportion of patients in each treatment group who achieve PR 
(including PR-L) or higher. Associated 95% Clopper-Pearson CI will be calculated by treatment group. 
The odds ratio (and 95% CI), which will be provided as a measure of the relative treatment effect, will 
be estimated using the stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method. The BR arm will serve as the 
reference treatment group in the calculations of the odds ratio. Given the high level of ORR (95%) 
observed in the BR arm patients in CLL10 study (Eichhorst et al 2016), the comparison between 
treatment groups for the ORR endpoint in cohort 1 will be descriptive. Patients with no post-baseline 
response assessment (due to any reason) will be considered as non-responders. 
Interim analyses 
Up to 2 analyses of PFS are planned: an interim analysis and the final analysis. The outcomes 
determined by the IRC will serve as the primary data source for the primary analysis of PFS. The 
monitoring boundary for early stopping in PFS will be determined using O’Brien-Fleming alpha 
spending function (Lan and DeMets 1983) for efficacy and Haybittle-Peto method (Haybittle 1971; Peto 
et al 1976) for futility so that the overall Type I error is less than or equal to 0.025 (1-sided). The 
interim analysis will be performed when approximately 86 events (73% of the target number of events 
at final analysis) from Arms A and B in Cohort 1 are observed. It is estimated that it will take 
approximately 33 months to observe 86 events under the assumptions described in Section 4. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/896488/2022  
Page 60/181 
 
 
 
futility will be non-binding. Information is based on number of events. Monitoring boundaries will be 
calculated for the interim analysis based on the actual number of PFS events observed up to the data 
cut-off of the interim analysis. Deviation from the scheduled interim analyses will not affect overall 
Type I error. 
The inferential comparisons for the secondary endpoints will also be performed if a stopping boundary 
for PFS is met at any of the analyses. 
The final analysis of OS will be performed at the end of the study, approximately 5 years after first 
patient randomized. Two interim analyses of OS are planned at the time of the interim and final 
analysis of PFS. Given a 3-year 92% survival rate observed in the BR arm patients in the CLL10 study 
(Eichhorst et al 2016), the planned interim OS analyses are not expected to have enough power to 
show statistical difference between the two arms. Therefore, a one-sided 0.00005 alpha will be set for 
each of the two planned interim analyses. 
Multiplicity considerations: Secondary Endpoint Testing Procedures 
The inferential tests associated with the interim and final analyses of PFS in cohort 1 (primary efficacy 
endpoint) will be assessed against an overall 1-sided significance level of 0.025. Study-wide type-I 
error will be controlled at the level 0.025 for the testing of the primary endpoint and one secondary 
endpoint OS in cohort 1. All other inferences will be descriptive without multiplicity adjustment. OS is 
tested only if the primary endpoint, PFS, is significant. 
The significance level for the OS analysis at the interim and final PFS analysis will be 0.00005, and the 
final OS analysis will be assigned a one-sided alpha of 0.0249. The secondary endpoint testing 
procedure is closed testing procedures and preserves the family-wise error rate at 0.025 in the strong 
sense. 
SAP addendum 
The purpose of this statistical analysis plan (SAP) addendum is to describe the additional analyses for 
overall survival to be performed per the requests from the US FDA. As specified in the protocol, the 
final analysis of OS for cohort 1 will be performed approximately 5 years after the first subject was 
randomized in Cohort 1. The first subject was randomized on October 31, 2017, and the final analysis 
is planned for November 2022. 
BGB-3111-305 
Analysis Populations for Efficacy 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set included all randomized patients. The ITT Analysis Set was the 
primary analysis set for efficacy analyses except for the interim analysis of response endpoints 
including overall response rate, duration of response, and rate of PR-L or higher, which were based on 
the first 415 randomized patients as prespecified for the interim analysis. 
The Per-protocol Analysis Set includes patients who received any dose of study drug and had no critical 
protocol deviation.  
The Safety Analysis Set includes all patients who received any dose of study drug. 
Primary Efficacy Analysis 
Primary endpoint ORR 
The primary hypothesis testing for the primary endpoint of ORR per investigator assessment will be to 
demonstrate the noninferiority of zanubrutinib to ibrutinib. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/896488/2022  
Page 61/181 
 
 
 
Noninferiority testing for ORR 
The null and alternative hypotheses for the noninferiority test are as follows: 
H0NI: Response ratio (zanubrutinib/ibrutinib) ≤ 0.8558 
HaNI: Response ratio (zanubrutinib/ibrutinib) > 0.8558 
The noninferiority hypothesis of ORR will be tested at each analysis using a stratified Wald test against 
a null response ratio of 0.8558. 
Superiority testing for ORR 
If the noninferiority in ORR per investigator assessment is statistically significant, then the superiority 
of zanubrutinib to ibrutinib in ORR will be tested. The null and alternative hypotheses for the 
superiority test are as follows: 
H0SUP: Response ratio (zanubrutinib/ibrutinib) ≤ 1 
HaSUP: Response ratio (zanubrutinib/ibrutinib) > 1 
The superiority hypothesis of ORR will be tested using a stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. The 
95% confidence interval (CI) for the response ratio will be constructed using a normal approximation. 
ORR will be summarized for each treatment arm along with its corresponding 95% CI. 
Response in case of intercurrent events 
BOR is defined as the best response from the randomization date to the data cut-off date, disease 
progression or the start of new CLL/SLL therapy, whichever comes first. Patients without any 
postbaseline disease assessment (regardless of the reason) will be considered as non-responders. 
Supportive analyses for ORR  
1. 
While the primary efficacy endpoint is per investigator assessment, ORR per independent 
central review will also be analyzed to support the primary analysis. In the United States, ORR 
assessed by independent central review will be the basis for regulatory decisions. 
2. 
3. 
The noninferiority of the primary endpoint of ORR will also be analyzed in the Per-protocol 
Analysis Set. 
Sensitivity analysis of investigator-assessed overall response rate was performed that counted 
assessments of PR-L that were subsequently followed by PR or higher responses as confirmed 
best overall responses of PR for CLL patients.  
4. 
To account for disease progression due to study drug interruption, ORR and BOR will be 
summarized based on all disease assessments through the data cut-off date, disease 
progression or the start of new CLL/SLL therapy, whichever comes first; however, disease 
progression that occurs within 6 weeks of a study drug interruption of at least 7 days will not 
be counted as disease progression for the purpose of this sensitivity analysis. 
5. 
To account for the impact of COVID-19, investigator-assessed overall response rate was 
summarized for each treatment arm excluding patients who died due to COVID-19.  
Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
PFS per investigator 
Noninferiority testing for PFS per Investigator Assessment 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/896488/2022  
Page 62/181 
 
 
 
 
The null and alternative hypotheses for the noninferiority test are as follows: 
H0NI: HR (zanubrutinib/ibrutinib) ≥ 1.3319 
 HaNI: HR (zanubrutinib/ibrutinib) < 1.3319 
At the final analysis of PFS, hypothesis testing for the noninferiority of PFS per investigator assessment 
will be based on the entire ITT Analysis Set using a stratified Wald test and will have a 1-sided 
significance level of 0.02498.   
Superiority testing for PFS per Investigator Assessment 
If the noninferiority of zanubrutinib to ibrutinib in PFS per investigator assessment is statistically 
significant, then the superiority in PFS per investigator assessment will be tested. The null and 
alternative hypotheses for the superiority test are as follows: 
H0SUP: HR (zanubrutinib/ibrutinib) ≥ 1 
HaSUP: HR (zanubrutinib/ibrutinib) < 1 
Hypothesis testing for the superiority of PFS per investigator assessment will be based on the entire 
ITT Analysis Set using a stratified log-rank test and will have the same 1-sided significance level of 
0.02498 (equivalent to a chi-squared p-value cut-off of 0.04996) used for the noninferiority PFS 
testing. 
Additional descriptive analysis for PFS 
The HR for PFS and its 95% CI will be estimated from a stratified Cox regression model. The 
distribution of PFS, including the median and other quartiles, and the PFS rate at selected timepoints 
such as 12, 18 and 24 months, will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method for each treatment 
arm. The 95% CI for the median and the other quartiles of PFS will be estimated using the 
Brookmeyer-Crowley method. The duration of follow-up for PFS will be estimated using the reverse 
Kaplan-Meier method (Schemper and Smith 1996). Kaplan-Meier curves for PFS will be presented for 
each treatment arm.

Key secondary endpoint of PFS 
1. 
2. 
3. 
The non-inferiority of the key secondary endpoint of PFS will also be analyzed in the Per protocol 
Analysis Set. 
Alternative  censoring  rules  such  as  censoring  for  new  CLL/SLL  therapies  will  be  applied  as 
another sensitivity analysis of PFS. 
To account for disease progression due to study drug interruption, PFS will also be summarized 
where disease progression that occurs within 6 weeks of a study drug interruption of at least 7 
days will not be counted as disease progression for the purpose of this sensitivity analysis. 
4. 
To account for the impact of COVID-19, PFS will be summarized for each treatment arm while 
additionally censoring deaths due to COVID-19. 
Key secondary SAFETY endpoint: Atrial fibrillation/flutter incidence 
Hypothesis testing on the rate of atrial fibrillation/flutter will be performed using an unstratified chi-
squared test if the expected counts in the 2 x 2 contingency table (treatment arm by atrial fibrillation/ 
flutter status) are at least 5 patients. If any expected count in the 2 x 2 contingency table is less than 
5 patients, then hypothesis testing will be performed using Fisher’s exact test. 
Multiplicity Adjustment 
To control the study-wide type I error, individual significance levels will be adjusted for the tests of the 
primary endpoint of ORR per investigator assessment (noninferiority and superiority), and the key 
secondary endpoint of PFS per investigator assessment (noninferiority and superiority). Multiplicity due 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/896488/2022  
Page 64/181 
 
 
 
 
to multiple endpoints and multiple tests will be handled per the graphical approach by Maurer and 
Bretz (2013) utilizing fixed sequence hierarchical testing. Hypothesis testing will be performed 
according to the multiplicity adjustment as per the flowchart below 
Figure 22: Flowchart for the multiplicity adjustment. 
One interim analysis of ORR was planned at approximately 12 months after 415 patients have been 
randomized, and the final analysis of ORR will occur approximately 12 months after 600 patients have 
been randomized. Hypothesis testing for the noninferiority of ORR at the interim analysis will be based 
on the first 415 randomized patients only and will have a 1-sided significance level of 0.005. The 
monitoring boundaries for the noninferiority test are based on the O’Brien Fleming boundary 
approximated by the Lan-DeMets spending function with an overall 1-sided level of 0.025. Hypothesis 
testing for the noninferiority of ORR at the final analysis will be based on the entire ITT Analysis Set 
and will have a 1-sided significance level based on the actual information fraction (or covariance) of 
the interim and final test statistics. With 652 patients in the ITT Analysis Set at the final analysis, the 
actual information fraction is 64% (415/652), and the 1-sided significance level for the final analysis 
will be 0.0235.  
A single analysis of PFS is performed for the purpose of inference when approximately 205 PFS events 
have occurred; however, a 1-sided significance level of 0.00001 will be applied to each of the two 
descriptive analyses of PFS for the interim and final analyses of ORR to compensate for the potential 
type I error increase from the descriptive analysis. From the time of the ORR analyses to the analysis 
of PFS after 205 events have occurred, the sponsor will continue to maintain trial integrity according to 
the DIPP. 
If the noninferiority of zanubrutinib to ibrutinib in ORR is statistically significant, then the superiority of 
zanubrutinib to ibrutinib in the key secondary endpoint of atrial fibrillation/flutter will be tested but 
separately from the fixed sequence hierarchical testing that includes ORR and PFS. The interim 
analysis will be performed on the Safety Analysis Set restricted to the first 415 randomized patients 
and according to the actual treatment received. The final analysis will be performed on the Safety 
Analysis Set according to the actual treatment received. The monitoring boundaries for the superiority 
test are based on the O’Brien Fleming boundary approximated by the Lan-DeMets spending function 
with an overall 1-sided level of 0.025. If hypothesis testing for the superiority of the rate of atrial 
fibrillation/flutter is performed at the interim analysis, it will have a 1-sided significance level of 0.005 
(equivalent to a chi-squared p-value cut-off of 0.0099). If hypothesis testing for the superiority of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/896488/2022  
Page 65/181 
 
 
 
 
rate of atrial fibrillation/flutter is performed at the final analysis, it will have a 1-sided significance level 
of0.0235 (equivalent to a chi-squared p-value cutoff of 0.0469). 
Changes to the SAP and planned analyses 
This clinical study report reflects analyses performed on data collected through a cutoff date of 31 
December 2020. After review of the interim analysis data by the independent DMC (20 April 2021), the 
DMC determined that the boundary was met for noninferiority of overall response rate. 
Changes to the Planned Analyses 
The following analyses are provided in the CSR but were not defined in the SAP or study protocols. 
Patient disposition, characteristics, prior systemic therapies and study drug exposure were provided for 
the first 415 patients randomized. 
Efficacy summaries were provided based on the first 415 patients randomized. These included analyses 
of PFS by investigator assessment and by independent central review as well as sensitivity analyses of 
PFS by investigator assessment and by independent central review that censored for new CLL/SLL 
therapies and overall survival. Analyses of duration of response by investigator assessment and by 
independent central review were also provided that include censoring for new CLL/SLL therapies. The 
above efficacy analyses of PFS and duration of response were performed for the subgroup of patients 
with del17p and the subgroup of patients with del17p and/or TP53 mutations. 
Summaries of treatment-emergent adverse events among the first 415 patients randomized were 
provided based on the Safety Analysis Set, including treatment-emergent adverse events by System 
Organ Class and Preferred Term, Grade 3 or higher, serious, those leading to death or treatment 
discontinuation. Additionally, treatment-emergent adverse events of special interest were summarized 
for the first 415 patients randomized. Shift tables for comparison of baseline toxicity grade versus 
worst postbaseline toxicity grade were provided for laboratory parameters of interest. Box-and-whisker 
plots showing the mean, median, 25th and 75th percentiles, and outlier values (ie, > 1.5 times the 
interquartile range) were provided for laboratory parameters of interest. 
Changes in Study Conduct and Planned Analyses Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic 
An internal committee was formed to evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) on BeiGene 
clinical studies in February 2020. This cross-functional team assessed and developed appropriate 
contingency measures in line with local and global regulatory guidance to maintain patient safety and 
study integrity. The measures were initially focused on sites in China and subsequently expanded to 
the global sites. Patients were prospectively informed of the specific COVID-19 responses, potential 
impacts on study conduction, and signed a consent addendum.

Notable changes include: 
• Added an option to re-escalate the zanubrutinib dose after dose reduction with approval from the 
medical monitor based on available safety data for zanubrutinib  
• Added a statement that TLS has been infrequently reported with zanubrutinib and ibrutinib treatment 
based on available safety data for TLS in patients administered ibrutinib and zanubrutinib 
Changes to the Planned Analyses 
The subgroup analyses by race were not included as most patients (89.1%) were white. Subgroup 
analyses for complex karyotype defined as ≥ 5 abnormalities were excluded due to the small number 
of patients with ≥ 5 abnormalities in karyotype at the baseline; furthermore, complex karyotype 
assessment was not complete at the time of the data cutoff. 
There were some discrepancies in stratification by IRT versus eCRF. Thus, a sensitivity analysis using 
the eCRF stratification factors was conducted. The results were similar to the primary analysis using 
IRT stratification. 
For the primary analysis and the sensitivity analyses specified in the SAP, treatment discontinuation 
due to adverse event (AE) was handled following the treatment policy strategy, ie, PFS was defined 
regardless of the occurrence of the intercurrent event (ICE). Two sensitivity analyses were conducted 
following two additional strategies to handle the ICE: composite strategy (ie, consider treatment 
discontinuation due to AE as a component event for PFS); and hypothetical strategy (ie, PFS was 
censored at the last adequate disease assessment prior to treatment discontinuation due to AE). 
The scores and mean changes for each domain of EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire were summarized for 
each assessment timepoint. The responder analysis for GHS/QoL was not conducted because there was 
not a well-defined threshold to define “improved” or “worsened” and the summary of mean changes 
and the comparison using a restricted maximum likelihood based mixed model for repeated measures 
(MMRM) have provided adequate information to assess the treatment effect on the GHS/QoL. Since 
Cohort 1a efficacy data are preliminary, no efficacy analyses will be presented in this CSR. 
Protocol deviations 
The CRO identified potential protocol deviations in 2 ways: observable protocol deviations were 
identified by CRO monitors and other project team members, usually during site visits coincident with 
the source document verification process; and programmatic protocol deviations were identified via 
automated edit checks of the data in the clinical database. In China, these activities were conducted by 
BeiGene. Protocol deviations were assessed as either protocol deviation (non-important) or important 
and reviewed by the CRO or BeiGene’s clinical operations team (China) in consultation with the medical 
monitor before a final determination was made. Important protocol deviations were defined as those 
that were likely to have had a major impact on the patient’s rights, safety, well-being, and/or on the 
validity of the data for analysis. The final determination of important protocol deviations was made by 
the medical monitor, using the criteria that define important protocol deviation in the ICH E3 guidelines 
as follows. 
• Patient randomized even though he/she did not satisfy study eligibility criteria 
• Patient developed study drug withdrawal criteria but was not withdrawn 
• Patient received wrong study treatment or incorrect dose 
• Patient received prohibited concomitant treatment

Critical protocol deviations are a subset of important protocol deviations that have the potential to 
affect the results of analyses of the primary or secondary objectives of the study. Critical protocol 
deviations were identified and used to define the Per-protocol Analysis Set. 
Protocol Deviations – Cohort 1 
Important protocol deviations (IPDs) were reported in 10 (4.1%) patients in the zanubrutinib arm and 
2 (0.8%) patients in the B+R arm. Three patients in the zanubrutinib arm and 1 patient in the B+R 
arm reported critical protocol deviations. Important protocol deviation that related to COVID-19 were 
reported in 2 (0.8%) patients in the zanubrutinib arm and 0 (0.0%) patient in the B+R arm. IPDs are 
summarized. Study conduct, efficacy and safety conclusions were not impacted by these reported 
important and critical protocol deviations when considering the limited number of reported cases. 
Protocol Deviations – Cohort 2 
Important protocol deviations were reported in 2 (1.8%) patients in the zanubrutinib arm. One patient 
(0.9%) in the zanubrutinib arm reported critical protocol deviation. No important protocol deviation 
that related to COVID-19 was reported in the zanubrutinib arm. 
Study conduct, efficacy and safety conclusions were not impacted by these reported important and 
critical protocol deviations when considering the limited number of reported cases.

rate) and the key secondary endpoint (PFS). 
• Added to the note of Appendix 2 and Appendix 3 that patient may continue study treatment post first 
assessed PD due to drug hold if it was perceived that the patient would benefit from continued 
treatment. 
Changes  to  Planned  Data/Sample  Collection  Drop  Out  of  the  Self-Administered  Quality  of  Life 
Questionnaires 
Optional self-administration of a device-based quality of life questionnaire and activity tracker was 
planned for this study. However, this evaluation was aborted because data were obtained only from 2 
zanubrutinib-treated patients. Questionnaires were completed once at baseline prior to treatment 
initiation without follow-up. Data for passive activity tracking and walk test data prior to treatment 
initiation was collected from 1 patient without follow-up. Data were not provided in this CSR. 
PK Sample Collection and Informed Consent Form 
Forty-seven out of 327 patients in the zanubrutinib arm were not included in the PK reporting at the 
data cutoff date because confirming their consent with respect to the location of the bioanalytical 
laboratory was in process. 
Changes to the Planned Analyses 
The following analyses are provided in the CSR but were not defined in the SAP or study protocols. 
Patient disposition, characteristics, prior systemic therapies and study drug exposure were provided for 
the first 415 patients randomized. Efficacy summaries were provided based on the first 415 patients 
randomized. These included analyses of PFS by investigator assessment and by independent central 
review as well as sensitivity analyses of PFS by investigator assessment and by independent central 
review that censored for new CLL/SLL therapies and overall survival. Analyses of duration of response 
by investigator assessment and by independent central review were also provided that include 
censoring for new CLL/SLL therapies. The above efficacy analyses of PFS and duration of response

were performed for the subgroup of patients with del17p and the subgroup of patients with del17p 
and/or TP53 mutations. 
Summaries of treatment-emergent adverse events among the first 415 patients randomized were 
provided based on the Safety Analysis Set, including treatment-emergent adverse events by System 
Organ Class and Preferred Term, Grade 3 or higher, serious, those leading to death or treatment 
discontinuation. Additionally, treatment-emergent adverse events of special interest were summarized 
for the first 415 patients randomized. Shift tables for comparison of baseline toxicity grade versus 
worst postbaseline toxicity grade were provided for laboratory parameters of interest. Box-and-whisker 
plots showing the mean, median, 25th and 75th percentiles, and outlier values (ie, > 1.5 times the 
interquartile range) were provided for laboratory parameters of interest. 
Protocol deviations 
Study conduct was monitored by the CRO and the sponsor’s medical monitor (BeiGene). The CRO 
identified potential protocol deviations in 2 ways: observable protocol deviations were identified by 
CRO monitors and other project team members, usually during site visits coincident with the source 
document verification process; and programmatic protocol deviations were identified via automated 
edit checks of the data in the clinical database. In China, these activities were conducted by BeiGene. 
Protocol deviations were assessed as either minor or important and reviewed by the CRO or BeiGene’s 
clinical operations team (China) in consultation with the medical monitor before a final determination 
was made. Important protocol deviations were defined as those that were likely to have had a major 
impact on the patient’s rights, safety, well-being, and/or on the validity of the data for analysis. The 
final determination of important protocol deviations was made by the medical monitor, using the 
criteria that define important protocol deviation in the ICH E3 guidelines as follows. 
• Patient randomized even though he/she did not satisfy study eligibility criteria 
• Patient developed study drug withdrawal criteria but was not withdrawn 
• Patient received wrong study treatment or incorrect dose 
• Patient received prohibited concomitant treatment 
Critical protocol deviations are a subset of important protocol deviations that have the potential to 
affect the results of analyses of the primary or secondary objectives of the study. Critical protocol 
deviations were identified and used to define the Per-Protocol Analysis Set. Important protocol 
deviations were reported in 5 (1.5%) patients in the zanubrutinib arm and 2 (0.6%) patients in the 
ibrutinib arm. One patient (064005-004) had a critical protocol deviation (prohibitive medication or 
treatment) in the zanubrutinib arm. There were no important or critical protocol deviations related to 
COVID-19. 
Study conduct, efficacy and safety conclusions were not impacted by these reported important and 
critical protocol deviations when considering the limited number of reported cases.

Title: An International, Phase 3, Open-label, Randomized Study of BGB-3111 Compared with Bendamustine plus 
Rituximab in Patients with Previously Untreated Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma  
Study identifier 
BGB-3111-304; EudraCT 2017-001551-31 
Design 
Hypothesis 
Study BGB-3111-304 is a Phase 3, multicentre, open-label randomized study of zanubrutinib 
versus  bendamustine  plus  rituximab  (B+R)  in  patients  with  previously  untreated  chronic 
lymphocytic  leukaemia/  small  lymphocytic  lymphoma  (CLL/SLL)  without  deletion  17p 
(Cohort 1). 
This  study  also  has  a  Cohort  2  of  patients  with  deletion  17p  who  receive  zanubrutinib 
treatment only since chemotherapy is not appropriate as therapy for this population.   
Progression-free survival will be compared between the 2 arms in Cohort 1 (patients without 
deletion  17p)  using  a  stratified  log-rank  test  based  on  the  following  3  randomization 
stratification factors: age (< 65 years vs ≥ 65 years), Binet stage (C vs A or B), and IGHV 
mutational status (mutated vs unmutated). 
Duration of main phase: 
Duration of Run-in phase:  
First patient was enrolled on 31 October 2017 and the 
last  patient  was  enrolled  on  22  July  2019.  Study  was 
ongoing as of the data cutoff date of 07 May 2021. The 
study duration is estimated to be approximately 5 years 
after first subject is randomized.

Hypothesis: PFS superiority of Arm A (zanubrutinib) versus Arm B (B+R) in Cohort 1.  
The sample size calculation for Cohort 1 is based on the hypothesis on PFS by independent 
central review. Assuming the PFS hazard ratio (Arm A/Arm B) in Cohort 1 is 0.58, 118 events 
are required to achieve 83.5% power at 2-sided alpha of 0.05 to reject the null hypothesis 
when 1 interim analysis is planned after 73% of the target number of events at final analysis 
(approximately  86  events).  Based  on  the  rate  of  accrual  anticipated  in  this  study,  it  was 
planned to randomize a total of approximately 450 subjects in a 1:1 ratio to the 2 treatment 
arms in Cohort 1.  
Arm A (Cohort 1) 
Zanubrutinib,  160  mg  twice  daily,  until  disease 
progression,  unacceptable  toxicity,  treatment  consent 
withdrawal, or study termination, 241 patients enrolled.   
Treatments groups 
Arm B (Cohort 1) 
Bendamustine  was  administered  intravenously  at  a 
dose of 90 mg/m2/day on the first 2 days of each cycle 
for 6 cycles. 
Rituximab was administered intravenously at a dose of 
375 mg/m2 for Cycle 1 and at a dose of 500 mg/m2 for 
Cycles 2 to 6, 
238 patients enrolled.

Title: A Phase 3, Randomized Study of Zanubrutinib (BGB-3111) Compared with Ibrutinib in Patients with 
Relapsed/Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukaemia or Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma  
Study identifier 
BGB-3111-305; EudraCT 2018-001366-42 
Study BGB-3111-305 is a Phase 3, multicentre, randomized, open-label study of 
zanubrutinib compared with ibrutinib in patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) 
chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).   
Duration of main phase: 
Design 
Duration of Run-in phase:  
First patient was enrolled on 01 November 2018 
and  the  last  patient  was  enrolled  on  15 
December  2020.  Study  was  ongoing  as  of  the 
data cutoff date of 31 December 2020. The study 
duration  is  estimated  to  be  approximately  51 
months after first subject is randomized. 
not applicable 
Duration of Extension phase:  not applicable 
Hypothesis 
Non-inferiority followed by Superiority (sequential testing). 
The primary hypothesis testing for the primary endpoint of overall response rate 
by investigator assessment was to demonstrate the noninferiority of zanubrutinib 
to ibrutinib.  One interim analysis occurred approximately 12 months after 415 
patients had  been  randomized.    The  final  analysis  will occur  approximately  12 
months after 600 patients have been randomized. 
If noninferiority is demonstrated either at the interim or the final analysis, further 
testing for the superiority of zanubrutinib to ibrutinib will be performed. 
Assuming a response ratio (zanubrutinib arm/ibrutinib arm) of 1.03 (72%/70%), 
600  patients  will  provide  more  than  90%  power  to  demonstrate  the  non- 
inferiority  of  zanubrutinib  to  ibrutinib  at  the  non-inferiority  margin  of  0.8558 
(response ratio) and 1-sided alpha level of 0.025 when there is 1 interim analysis 
at 69% information fraction (415 out of 600 patients).

escalation (Part 1) and expansion (Part 2) study designed to investigate the safety and PK of 
zanubrutinib in patients with B-cell malignancies. This first-in-human study for zanubrutinib has been 
completed. A total of 125 patients with CLL/SLL were enrolled in the study, with a median duration of 
treatment of 37.13 months (range: 0.8 to 71.5 months) for patients with R/R CLL/SLL, and 49.17 
months (range: 3.6 to 65.3 months) for patients with TN CLL/SLL. Data for these patients are 
presented in Module 2.7.3 and briefly below. 
The study was conducted at sites in Australia, New Zealand, Italy, South Korea, the UK, and the USA. 
The study was conducted in 2 parts and included patients with TN (N = 22) and R/R CLL/SLL (n = 103) 
who received ≥ 1 dose of study drug. This dose finding and expansion study was the first-in-human 
study for zanubrutinib and has a median follow-up time of 50.87 months (range: 11.1 to 65.3 months) 
for patients with TN CLL/SLL and a median follow-up time of 40.44 months (range: 5.3 to 71.5 
months) for patients with R/R CLL/SLL. These extensive data help to support high overall response 
rates, long duration of response, and long PFS in patients with CLL/SLL treated with zanubrutinib. 
Results from Study BGB-3111-AU-003 demonstrate that zanubrutinib is safe and effective in patients 
with 
CLL/SLL. 
Efficacy results for Study BGB-3111-AU-003 are briefly described here; In patients with R/R CLL/SLL, 
the overall response rate (PR with lymphocytosis or better) was high at 94.2% (97 of 103 patients; 
95% CI: 87.8%, 97.8%). The overall response rate was similar in patients with del(17p) mutation 
(92.3% [12 of 13 patients; 95% CI: 64.0%, 99.8%]). The PR or better rate overall was 90.3%, with a 
lower rate in patients with del(17p) mutations (84.6%). The CR/CRi rate was 15.5% overall, with a 
rate of 7.7% (1 patient) in patients with del(17p)+ disease. The overall response rate (PR-L or better) 
and the PR or better rate in patients with TN CLL/SLL was 100.0% (22 patients; 95% CI: 84.9%, 
100.0% for both), with no difference in either rate according to del(17p) mutation status. The CR/CRi 
rate overall was 22.7%; none of the patients with del(17p) achieved a CR. 
In patients with R/R CLL/SLL, the median PFS was 61.4 months (95% CI: 50.4 months, not evaluable) 
with a median follow-up of 39.4 months. Twenty-four (23.3%) events were observed, including 23 
events of disease progression and 1 death. The median PFS was lower in patients with del(17p) (50.2 
months) than in patients without del(17p) (61.4 months). Overall, PFS rates at 12, 24, and 36 months 
were 96.0%, 90.6%, and 82.8%, respectively. Lower rates were observed in patients with del(17p) 
disease (92.3%, 75.5%, and 75.5% at 12, 24, and 36 months, respectively). 
Among patients with TN CLL/SLL, the median PFS was not evaluable (95% CI: 41.4 months, not 
evaluable) with a median follow-up of 49.4 months. Events were observed in 5 patients (22.7%), 
including 4 disease progression events and 1 death. Progression-free survival rates overall at 12, 24, 
36, and 48 months were 95.2%, 90.5%, 81.0%, and 74.4%, respectively. With an overall median 
follow-up time of 48.9 months (range: 5.3 to 71.5 months), the median overall survival was not 
reached in either patients with R/R CLL/SLL or patients with TN disease. Overall survival rates for 
patients with CLL/SLL on the study were 98.4%, 95.8%, 91.1%, and 86.2% at 12, 24, 36, and 48 
months, respectively. Rates were similar for patients with TN disease (100.0%, 95.2%, 90.5%, and

90.5% at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months, respectively) and R/R disease (98.0%, 95.9%, 91.2%, and 
84.6% at 12, 24, 36, and 48 months, respectively).  
In patients with R/R CLL/SLL, overall survival was also similar in patients with del(17p)+ and del(17p)- 
CLL/SLL. The median overall survival was not reached after a median follow-up time of 44.5 months 
(range: 9.4 to 62.6 months) for patients with del(17p)+ and 49.3 months (range: 5.8 to 71.5 months) 
for patients with del(17p)- CLL. 
Study BGB-3111-205 
Study BGB-3111-205 was a single-arm, multicenter Phase 2 study designed to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of zanubrutinib in patients with CLL/SLL who had relapsed or whose disease was refractory 
after ≥ 1 prior treatment regimen(s). The study was conducted at sites in China. Ninety-one patients 
were enrolled and treated with zanubrutinib and received zanubrutinib 160 mg orally twice daily 
continuously in repeated 28-day cycles. Study BGB-3111-205 demonstrates that zanubrutinib is safe 
and effective in a population of mostly high-risk patients from China with CLL/SLL. Patients enrolled on 
BGB-3111-205 were of poor prognosis. At study entry, most patients had advanced clinical stage 
disease (Binet Stage C CLL [67.1%], Rai Stage III or IV CLL [67.1%], or Stage IV SLL [77.8%]). Over 
one-half of all patients (56.0%) had unmutated IGHV; approximately one-quarter of all patients had 
disease with ≥ 1 poor prognostic cytogenetic feature including del(17p), del(11q), and/or TP53 
mutation. Approximately one-half of patients had received ≥ 2 prior lines of therapy. For most patients 
(79.1%), their disease was refractory to the most recent systemic therapy. 
The overall response rate, defined as the proportion of patients with a best response of PR-L or better 
was 87.9% (95% CI: 79.40%, 93.81%; p < 0.0001 with respect to the null hypothesis of 32% [based 
on the overall response rate in the historical control as of the study start]). The median PFS for this 
study, as assessed by investigator assessment, has not been reached. The estimated PFS event-free 
rates by investigator assessment at 24 and 36 months were 80.5% (95% CI: 70.52%, 87.42%) and 
68.1% (95% CI: 56.56%, 77.24%), respectively. With a median follow-up time for PFS of 34.5 months 
(range: 0.8 months, 41.4 months), as estimated by the reverse Kaplan-Meier method, the median PFS 
as assessed by independent central review, has not been reached. The estimated PFS event-free rates 
as assessed by independent central review at 24 and 36 months were 80.5% (95% CI: 70.52% to 
87.42%) and 68.1% (95% CI: 56.56% to 77.24%), respectively. 
Median overall survival (an exploratory study endpoint) has not been reached. The estimated overall 
survival rates at 24 and 36 months were 89.8% (95% CI: 81.27%, 94.55%) and 86.5% (95% CI: 
76.62%, 92.44%), respectively, through a median follow-up time of 35.1 months.

Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The MAH provided two pivotal studies, 304 and 305. Both are RCTs. While study 304 investigates the 
use of zanubrutinib in 1L, study 305 investigated the use of zanubrutinib in R/R setting. The line 
agnostic indication has been sufficiently justified by including and showing efficacy in not only 
treatment naïve patients, but also in patients with more than 1, 2 and 3 prior therapies. Overall, the 
design of the studies, objectives and endpoints are endorsed. Scientific advice for study 304 has been 
followed by the MAH. For study 305, the MAH changed the originally proposed study design in patients 
with R/R CLL without further interaction with the CHMP (primary endpoint of PFS was changed to 
ORR). 
In study 305 the primary endpoint was ORR (investigator-based) and PFS (investigator-based) is the 
only efficacy secondary endpoint considered in the testing strategy. The safety secondary endpoint of 
rate of atrial fibrillation/flutter was partially included in the testing strategy. The type I error due to 
multiple endpoints is controlled using a hierarchical approach. 
One interim analysis was planned for ORR to be performed after the first 415 randomized patients had 
the opportunity to receive treatment for at least 12 months. The monitoring boundaries for the 
noninferiority test were based on the O’Brien Fleming boundary approximated by the Lan-DeMets 
spending function with an overall 1-sided level of 0.025. 
A single analysis of PFS for the purpose of inference was planned when approximately 205 PFS events 
have occurred. However, two descriptive analyses of PFS for the interim and final analyses of ORR 
were to be performed. A 1-sided significance level of 0.00001 was to be applied to each of the 
analyses to compensate for the potential type I error increase from the descriptive analyses. 
The secondary safety endpoint rate of atrial fibrillation/flutter would only be tested if the non-inferiority 
hypothesis for ORR is rejected, but outside the testing strategy for PFS. The monitoring boundaries for 
the superiority test are based on the O’Brien Fleming boundary approximated by the Lan-DeMets 
spending function with an overall 1-sided level of 0.025. 
To summarize, the testing strategy is based on a hierarchical testing combined with alpha spending 
functions to control the type I error due to interim analyses. One interim (64 % of information fraction) 
and one final analysis are planned for ORR. First, non-inferiority will be tested, and if the null 
hypothesis is rejected, superiority will be tested. If superiority for ORR is shown, PFS was to be tested, 
first for non-inferiority and then for superiority. Two descriptive and one final analysis for PFS were 
planned to take place at the interim analysis for ORR, at the final analysis of ORR, and after 205 
events for PFS have occurred. For the descriptive analyses, an alpha of 0.00001 was assigned. The 
secondary safety endpoint rate of atrial fibrillation/flutter was to be tested for superiority if non-
inferiority for ORR was shown. To control the type I error due to multiple looks, the O’Brien Fleming 
boundary approximated by the Lan-DeMets spending function was implemented for ORR and atrial 
fibrillation rate.  
It is not considered appropriate to label the PFS interim analyses as descriptive since alpha is allocated 
and the “descriptive” analysis occurs before the inferential analysis. The consequences of making the 
PFS interim results public may compromise the interpretation of the “final” PFS results. Of note, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/896488/2022  
Page 123/181 
 
 
 
 
currently available PFS results are considered “descriptive” by the MAH. Updated results were 
requested (see Result section). 
The MAH clarified that the atrial fibrillation endpoint is not controlled for type I error inflation in the 
strong sense. It is reassuring that a lower occurrence of atrial fibrillation in the zanubrutinib arm was 
reported in two head-to-head studies. However, this does not compensate for the lack of strong 
control of the family-wise type I error in the 305 study for the endpoint frequency of atrial fibrillation.  
The current version of the SAP is version 1.0 dated March 12th, 2021. The data cut-off date was 31st 
December 2020. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses  
Study  304  met  its  primary  endpoint  showing  statistically  significant  and  clinically  meaningful 
improvement of PFS. Median PFS is 33.7 months in the BR arm, while it is not reached in the zanubrutinib 
arm.  The  MAH  performed  a  number  of  sensitivity  analyses  –  all  are  in  line  with  the  primary 
endpoint/objective of the study. Data are immature. Therefore, the MAH is asked to commit to providing 
the final PFS analysis as well as OS analysis post-approval (REC). In general, the secondary endpoints 
seem to support the primary endpoint, however, due to lack of control for multiplicity, no firm conclusions 
can be drawn. The ORR by IRC is 90% in Cohort 2. The median duration of follow up was 27.9 (range: 
1.0 to 38.8) and the event-free rate at 24 months 88.9% (95% CI 81.3, 93.6). These data clearly show 
that zanubrutinib lead to clinically meaningful results in CLL patients with del17p. 
The DMC determined on the 20 April 2021 that the boundary for non-inferiority of ORR (investigator-
based) was crossed and thus the study primary endpoint was met. In the CSR, several supplementary 
tables and descriptive analyse were presented. Those analyses do not affect the interpretation of the 
results of the trial. 
Study 305 also met its primary objective showing non-inferiority with 1-sided p-value. The ORR rate 
was 78.3% vs. 62.5% in zanubrutinib and ibrutinib arms respectively. The response ratio is 1.25 (1.10 
– 1.41). Superiority was met when applying a 2-sided p-value. However, for the interim analysis, only 
the first 415 randomized patients were included. The MAH was requested to present ORR, PFS results 
(investigator-  and  IRC  assessed)  and  OS  results  for  all  randomized  participants  regardless  of  their 
treatment duration using the ITT and PP-populations: With a median follow-up time of 22 months at the 
Final analysis ( +11 months) the ORR by INV (and IRC) in the ITT population was of the same magnitude 
as at the Interim analysis. A number of sensitivity analyses were planned and conducted. All are in line 
with the primary endpoint, showing at least non-inferiority to ibrutinib.  
Despite inclusion exclusion criteria of study 304 in the frontline setting clearly indicate that patients 
should have been unsuitable for treatment chemoimmunotherapy (FCR), study 305 showed non-
inferiority and superiority (based on INV assessment) against ibrutinib in the R/R setting. Having in 
mind that ibrutinib is also approved in 1L, and recommended in both fit and unfit patients, it seems 
justified to extrapolate the use of zanubrutinib to 1L fit patients. Thus, despite the limitations of study 
304 and the comparison against BR in an elderly and unfit population, the totality of evidence supports 
the use of zanubrutinib in both fit and unfit patients. There are no scientific arguments to require a 
non-inferiority study in 1st line against ibrutinib. In conclusion, a restriction of zanubrutinib to unfit 
patients in 1L is not scientifically nor clinically justified and the MAH’s proposal for 4.1 of the SmPC is 
supported.  As SLL is not considered a distinct entity to CLL,  the final indication only refers to CLL as 
follows:  
“BRUKINSA as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with chronic lymphocytic 
leukemia (CLL)”.

Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The MAH has provided two RCTs to support the claimed indication for CLL. Both studies met their 
primary objective, and are overall considered reasonably well-designed and well-conducted. Study 
BGB-3111-305 is the pivotal clinical study on which basis the CHMP issued a positive opinion on the 
treatment of patients with R/R CLL. The study is ongoing. The MAH accepted a recommendation from 
the CHMP to submit the final study report upon completion of the clinical study, which is expected in 
March 2023. 
2.5  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The zanubrutinib safety profile is derived from 1550 patients with CLL/SLL and other B-cell malignancies 
enrolled into 9 clinical studies (2 Phase 1 studies, 4 Phase 2 studies, and 3 Phase 3 studies, including 2 
pivotal Phase 3 studies), as described below. All of these studies have completed enrollment; 5 studies 
are complete, and 4 studies are ongoing. 
Comparative  safety  data  on  the  use  of  zanubrutinib  in  patients  with  CLL/SLL  are  derived  from  the  2 
Phase 3 studies, Study BGB-3111-304 (versus B+R) and Study BGB-3111-305 (versus ibrutinib).

Adverse events 
Study 304:  
A treatment-emergent adverse event was defined as an adverse event that had an onset date or was 
worsening in severity from baseline (pre-treatment) on or after the first dose of study drug up to 30 
days for Arms A and C patients and 90 days for Arm B patients following study drug discontinuation or 
the  start  of  new  anticancer  therapy  for  CLL/SLL,  whichever  comes  first.  Worsening  of  a  treatment-
emergent adverse event to Grade 5 beyond 30 days after the last dose of zanubrutinib, or beyond 90 
days  after  the  last  dose  of  rituximab  or  bendamustine,  was  also  considered  a  treatment-emergent 
adverse  event.  Two  sets  of  summary  tables  were  provided:  Treatment-emergent  adverse  events  and 
combined  treatment-emergent  adverse  events  plus  adverse  events/serious  adverse  events  reported 
during  the  Post-treatment  Follow-up  phase  (termed  “Treatment-Emergent  +  Post-Treatment”  in  the 
safety  tables).  All  adverse  events,  treatment-emergent  or  otherwise,  were  presented  in  patient  data 
listings.  
The  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  adverse  event  plus  post-treatment  phase  adverse  events  were 
reported as the number (and percentage) of patients with treatment-emergent adverse events plus post-
treatment phase adverse events by system organ class and preferred term. A patient was counted only 
once by the highest severity grade according to CTCAE v4.03 within a system organ class and preferred 
term, even if the patient experienced more than 1 treatment-emergent adverse event or post-treatment 
phase adverse event within a specific system organ class and preferred term.

Study 305: 
A treatment-emergent adverse event was defined as an adverse event that had an onset date on or after 
the first dose of study drug up to 30 days following study drug discontinuation or the day prior to initiation 
of a new CLL/SLL therapy, whichever occurred first. If a treatment-emergent adverse event worsened 
to  Grade  5  more  than  30  days  after  last  dose  of  study  drug  and  prior  to  initiation  of  a  new  CLL/SLL 
therapy, the Grade 5 AE was considered treatment-emergent. Only treatment-emergent adverse events

were  included  in  the  summary  tables.  All  adverse  events,  treatment-emergent  or  otherwise,  were 
included in patient data listings. 
The incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events was reported as the number (and percentage) of 
patients with treatment-emergent adverse events by System Organ Class and Preferred Term. A patient 
was counted only once by the highest severity grade according to NCI-CTCAE v4.03  within a System 
Organ  Class  and  Preferred  Term,  even  if  the  patient  experienced  more  than  1  treatment-emergent 
adverse events within a specific System Organ Class and Preferred Term.

Post marketing experience 
Cumulatively, as of 24 July 2021, approximately 7,576,866 capsules of zanubrutinib have been 
supplied to the market in Canada, China and the USA (equivalent to 1,894,217 daily doses; 
approximately 62,309.8 person-months; 5192.5 person-years. No regulatory actions concerning safety 
have been taken since the International Birth Date of 14 November 2019. 
Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety pool for this application consists of 938 patients with CLL/SLL and a total of 1550 with B-cell 
malignancies (the All Zanubrutinib pool), which is the safety pool presented in the SmPC (updated from 
779  patients  for  the  initial  application  for  WM).  The  All  Zanubrutinib  pool  all  received  either  the 
recommended dose of 160 mg BID (93.2%) or 320 mg QD (6.2%) as monotherapy. The median duration 
of  exposure  for  this  safety  pool  is  23  months.  In  line  with  the  Scientific  advice  by  the  CHMP;    “With 
respect to safety, taking into account the increasing experience with BTK inhibitors and the preclinical 
data  suggesting  that  BGB-3111  is  more  selective  than  ibrutinib  (which  should  result  in  higher 
tolerability),  the  proposed  safety  database  (more  than  1000  patients  exposed,  500  patients  with 
CLL/SLL)  were  considered  overall  adequate  for  the  assessment  in  the  claimed  indication”-    this  is 
considered an adequate safety pool.

Two randomized Phase 3 studies (BGB-3111-304 and BGB-3111-305) support the safety in the applied 
indication for CLL:  
Study BGB-3111-304:  
Patients with treatment naïve CLL/SLL treated with zanubrutinib monotherapy were randomised against 
bendamustine  +  rituximab  (BR)  in  patients  not  deemed  fit  to  receive  FCR.  Furthermore,  there  was  a 
non-randomised arm of patients with del17/ tp53 mutation receiving zanubrutinib monotherapy; these 
patients were also included in the safety population. Zanubrutinib had lower rates of neutropenia and 
gastrointestinal adverse events (particularly nausea and vomiting) compared with B+R. Higher rates of 
treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was seen with B+R compared with zanubrutinib (B+R 
13.7%;  zanubrutinib  8.3%;);  the  same  concerns  treatment  modification  (B+R  70.0%;  zanubrutinib 
47.9%).  
Study BGB-3111-305:  
Patients  with  R/R  CLL/SLL  treated  with  zanubrutinib  monotherapy  were  randomised  against  the  first-
generation  BTK-inhibitor  ibrutinib.  Diarrhoea  and  atrial  fibrillation/flutter  appeared  lower  among 
zanubrutinib-treated patients than in patients treated with ibrutinib.   
Generally, the safety profiles of the zanubrutinib treatment arms in studies 304 and 305 were consistent 
with results in the approved prescribing information and no new adverse events were observed.  
Integrated Safety Analysis Set  
In the Integrated Safety Analysis Set (N=1550), the overall zanubrutinib safety profile also appeared 
consistent with the known safety profile. No new signals for zanubrutinib were identified when safety 
findings were evaluated in the larger pooled All Zanubrutinib group.   
Across all groups, neutropenia and hypertension were the most commonly (> 5% of patients) reported 
≥Grade 3 adverse events. The lower frequencies of pneumonia and neutrophil count decreased could 
well be explained by the treatment-naïve patients in study 304 and the shorter follow-up in study 305. 
In Study 304 SAEs reported in >1% of patients were pneumonia (3.1%), COVID-19 (2.0%), COVID-19 
pneumonia (2.0%), and atrial fibrillation (1.8%).  
In Study 305 SAEs reported in > 1% of patients were pneumonia (3.1%) and COVID-19 (2.2%) 
In  the  ISS  pneumonia  was  the  most  common  SAE  in  every  group  studied  reported  in  6.8%  of  the 
population.  
Adverse events were the most common cause of death in both studies and comparable between arms.  
The safety database has been doubled in size with this application and thus allows for better 
characterization of the safety profile of Brukinsa. The ADRs Table under section 4.8 of the SmPC was 
updated and justification as to why some of the common ADRs should not be included was provided 
(see SmPC section 4.8). 
The safety pool for this application consists of 938 patients with CLL/SLL and a total of 1550 with B-cell 
malignancies (the All Zanubrutinib pool), which is the safety pool presented in the SmPC (updated from

treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was seen with B+R compared with zanubrutinib (B+R 
13.7%;  zanubrutinib  8.3%;);  the  same  concerns  treatment  modification  (B+R  70.0%;  zanubrutinib 
47.9%).  
Study BGB-3111-305:  
Patients  with  R/R  CLL/SLL  treated  with  zanubrutinib  monotherapy  were  randomised  against  the  first-
generation  BTK-inhibitor  ibrutinib.  Diarrhoea  and  atrial  fibrillation/flutter  appeared  lower  among 
zanubrutinib-treated patients than in patients treated with ibrutinib.   
Generally, the safety profiles of the zanubrutinib treatment arms in studies 304 and 305 were consistent 
with results in the approved prescribing information and no new adverse events were observed.  
Integrated Safety Analysis Set  
In the Integrated Safety Analysis Set (N=1550), the overall zanubrutinib safety profile also appeared 
consistent with the known safety profile. No new signals for zanubrutinib were identified when safety 
findings were evaluated in the larger pooled All Zanubrutinib group.   
Tumour lysis syndrome has been infrequently reported with zanubrutinib therapy, particularly in 
patients who were treated for CLL. A relevant warning has been included in the SmPC section 4.4 
advising to assess relevant risks (e.g., high tumour burden or blood uric acid level) and take 
appropriate precautions (see SmPC section 4.4). 
The safety database has been doubled in size with this application and thus allows for better 
characterization of the safety profile of Brukinsa. The MAH is asked to update the Table 3 in the SmPC; 
atrial fibrillation and flutter were included. In addition, hypertension, TLS, Hyperuricemia, pruritus, 
purpura and Peripheral oedema were also added on the list of ADR in Table 3 of Section 4.8 these 
ADRs were added in the PL as well (see PI).

Not applicable. 
Conclusions on clinical safety 
Zanubrutinib treatment was generally well tolerated, and the safety profile was consistent across 
patient groups. The spectrum of adverse events observed across all patient groups is consistent with 
the known toxicity profile for the BTK inhibitor class as well as those intrinsic to B-cell malignancy 
patient populations and were generally manageable, and for the most part, were reversible.  
No new safety concerns were observed.

3  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1  Therapeutic Context 
Disease or condition 
BRUKINSA  as  monotherapy  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  chronic  lymphocytic 
leukemia (CLL).  
Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Treatment  options 
for  CLL/SLL  patients 
include  multiagent  chemoimmunotherapy,  such  as 
fludarabine/cyclophosphamide/rituximab  (FCR),  bendamustine/rituximab(B+R),  and  chlorambucil/ 
obinutuzumab (Cl+O). Such treatments, however, are less effective in patients with high-risk disease; 
furthermore,  many  patients  cannot  tolerate  multiagent  chemoimmunotherapy  due  to  age  and 
comorbidities. Recent treatment options include BTK inhibitors such as ibrutinib or acalabrutinib. 
PI3K inhibitors such as idelalisib have also been approved however, these treatments have significant 
toxicities,  which  limit  tolerability  and  may  lead  to  treatment  discontinuation.  Front-line  treatment 
recommendations  as  per  European  Society  for  Medical  Oncology  (ESMO)  guidelines  are  summarized 
below. 
• 
Patients without TP53 mutation or del(17p)

Main clinical studies 
Study BGB-3111-304 is an ongoing, international, Phase 3, open-label, randomised study designed 
to evaluate the efficacy of zanubrutinib versus B+R in patients with previously untreated CLL/SLL. 
Approximately 710 patients will be enrolled in the study. 
The study included approximately 450 patients in Cohort 1 and approximately 80 additional patients 
from Chinese sites in Cohort 1a to support further analysis in the Chinese population. Cohort 1a was 
opened to enrollment in China when the Cohort 1 sample size was reached. Patients in Cohort 1 and 
Cohort 1a were randomised 1:1 to receive zanubrutinib (Arm A) or B+R (Arm B). 
There are 2 additional cohorts in the study which were not randomised: Cohort 2/Arm C, with 
approximately 100 planned patients with CLL/SLL with del(17p), and Cohort 3/Arm D, with 
approximately 80 planned patients with del(17p). Patients in Cohort 2 (Arm C) received zanubrutinib 
monotherapy in a non-randomized fashion since chemoimmunotherapy is not indicated as treatment 
Assessment report

for patients with del(17p) due to poor response reported in this patient population. Patients in Cohort 3 
(Arm D) received zanubrutinib in combination with venetoclax and are not included in this application.  
Study BGB-3111-305 is an ongoing, international Phase 3, open-label, randomised study of 
zanubrutinib versus ibrutinib in 652 patients (600 planned) with R/R CLL/SLL. Patients were 
randomised in a 1:1 manner to one of the following treatment arms: 
•  Arm A: Zanubrutinib 160 mg orally twice daily 
•  Arm B: Ibrutinib 420 mg orally once daily 
3.2  Favourable effects 
Study 304met its primary endpoint by showing a median PFS of 33.7 months in the BR arm, while it 
is not reached in the zanubrutinib arm; the hazard ratio (95% CI) being 0.42 (0.28, 0.63). The MAH 
performed a number of sensitivity analyses – all are in line with the primary endpoint/objective of the 
study. 
The ORR by IRC is 90% in Cohort 2. The median duration of follow up was 27.9 months (range: 1.0 to 
38.8) and the event-free rate at 24 months 88.9% (95% CI 81.3, 93.6).  
Study 305 also met its primary objective showing non-inferiority with 1-sided p-value. The ORR rate 
was 78.3% vs. 62.5% in zanubrutinib and ibrutinib arms respectively. The response ratio is 1.25 (1.10 
– 1.41). Superiority was met when applying a 2-sided p-value.   
3.3  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The IRC-assessed PFS results for study 304 with a DCO date of 07 May 2021 was considered as the 
final inferential analysis of PFS. The MAH has provided updated INV-PFS with a DCO date of 07 March 
2022 (+10 months) remaining consistent with the primary analysis with a HR of 0.33 (95% CI: 0.22 to 
0.48, descriptive P<0.0001). The MAH will provide the final OS analysis from Study 304 expected in 
Q2 2023.  
Despite inclusion /exclusion criteria of study 304 in the frontline setting clearly indicating that patients 
should have been unsuitable for treatment chemoimmunotherapy (FCR), thus covering also 1st line 
patients, study 305 showed non-inferiority against ibrutinib in the R/R setting. Having in mind that 
ibrutinib is also approved in 1L, and recommended in both fit and unfit patients, it seems justified to 
extrapolate the use of zanubrutinib to 1L fit patients. Thus, despite the limitations of study 304 and the 
comparison against BR in an elderly and unfit population, the totality of evidence supports the use of 
zanubrutinib in both fit and unfit patients.  
The MAH will provide the final CSR from Study 305. 
3.4  Unfavourable effects 
Study BGB-3111-304:  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/896488/2022  
Page 176/181 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients with treatment naïve CLL/SLL treated with zanubrutinib monotherapy were randomised 
against bendamustine + rituximab (BR) in patients not deemed fit to receive FCR. Furthermore, there 
was a non-randomised arm of patients with del17/ tp53 mutation receiving zanubrutinib monotherapy; 
these patients were also included in the safety population. Zanubrutinib had lower rates of neutropenia 
and gastrointestinal adverse events (particularly nausea and vomiting) compared with B+R. Higher 
rates of treatment discontinuation due to adverse events was seen with B+R compared with 
zanubrutinib (B+R 13.7%; zanubrutinib 8.3%;) or treatment modification (B+R 70.0%; zanubrutinib 
47.9%;). 
Study BGB-3111-305:  
Patients  with  R/R  CLL/SLL  treated  with  zanubrutinib  monotherapy  were  randomised  against  the  first-
generation  BTK-inhibitor  ibrutinib.  Diarrhoea  and  atrial  fibrillation/flutter  appeared  lower  among 
zanubrutinib-treated patients than in patients treated with ibrutinib.   
Generally, the safety profiles of the zanubrutinib treatment arms in studies 304 and 305 were consistent 
with results in the approved prescribing information and no new adverse events were observed.  
Integrated Safety Analysis Set  
In the Integrated Safety Analysis Set (N=1550), the overall zanubrutinib safety profile also appeared 
consistent with the known safety profile. No new signals for zanubrutinib were identified when safety 
findings were evaluated in the larger pooled All Zanubrutinib group.   
The profile of adverse events of special interest was similar in the All Zanubrutinib, All R/R CLL/SLL, 
and All CLL/SLL groups. In the All Zanubrutinib group, events within the categories of infections 
(65.7%), hemorrhage (48.1%), and neutropenia (27.5%) were the most frequently reported. Across 
all groups, neutropenia and hypertension were the most commonly (> 5% of patients) reported 
≥Grade 3 adverse events.  
3.5  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Long term safety data are still needed to be evaluated, more information will be expected from 
ongoing studies such as BGB-3111-LTE1; an Open-label, Multicenter, Long-term Extension Study of 
Zanubrutinib (BGB-3111) Regimens in Patients with B-cell Malignancies aiming to evaluate the long-
term safety of zanubrutinib, as monotherapy or in combination, in patients with B-cell malignancies 
who participated in a parent study for zanubrutinib (see RMP). Further data will also be provided from 
the final study report from study 305.

3.7  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Second-line  CLL/SLL  treatment  is  guided  by  the  duration  of  the  first  remission  for  relapsed  disease. 
Refractory disease is defined as having either no response to treatment or relapse within 6 months after 
the last treatment. ESMO guidelines recommend a change of therapeutic regimen in case of symptomatic 
relapse within 3 years, or refractory disease, in which case treatment with venetoclax (+/- rituximab), 
ibrutinib,  acalabrutinib,  or  other  BTKi  monotherapy  should  be  considered.  Patients  with  remissions  of 
more than 3 years may be re-exposed to the same time-limited regimen; however, repetition of the FCR 
regimen  is  not  recommended.  Other  treatment  options  include  acalabrutinib,  ibrutinib,  venetoclax  + 
rituximab,  or  idelalisib  +  rituximab.  For  patients  with  TP53  mutation  or  del(17p),  allogenic  stem-cell 
transplantation should be considered for fit patients. The US NCCN guidelines’ list of preferred regimens 
for  RR  CLL/SLL  patients  are  the  same  as  for  frontline  treatment  except  venetoclax  monotherapy  is 
recommended only for patients with TP53 mutation or del(17p).  
Since study 305 showed non-inferiority against ibrutinib in the R/R setting and having in mind that 
ibrutinib is also approved in 1L, and recommended in both fit and unfit patients, it seems justified to 
extrapolate the use of zanubrutinib to 1L fit patients. Thus, despite the limitations of study 304 and the 
comparison against BR in an elderly and unfit population, the totality of evidence supports the use of 
zanubrutinib in both fit and unfit patients. There are no scientific arguments to require a non-inferiority 
study in 1L against ibrutinib.  
The integrated safety pool has doubled since the initial approval for Waldenström’s MB; from 779 to 
1550 patients. Zanubrutinib treatment was generally well tolerated, and the safety profile was 
consistent across patient groups. The spectrum of adverse events observed across all patient groups is 
consistent with the known toxicity profile for the BTK inhibitor class as well as those intrinsic to B-cell 
malignancy patient populations and were generally manageable, and for the most part, were 
reversible. No new safety concerns were observed.  
Balance of benefits and risks 
Collectively results from Studies BGB-3111-304 and BGB-3111-305, including favourable PFS and ORR, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/896488/2022  
Page 179/181 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
durable responses, and improvements in important safety and tolerability assessments such as events 
leading to discontinuation or interruption of treatment, provide substantial evidence of a positive benefit-
risk assessment for zanubrutinib in the treatment of patients with CLL/SLL. In study 305 zanubrutinib 
demonstrated efficacy across risk groups.  
Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
In addition, as part of the application the MAH requested a 1-year extension of the market protection.   
However, since 1-year extension has been already granted by the CHMP as part of the procedure II-02 
in marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), an assessment as part of this procedure would be considered 
redundant and was not performed. 
3.8  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Brukinsa is positive.

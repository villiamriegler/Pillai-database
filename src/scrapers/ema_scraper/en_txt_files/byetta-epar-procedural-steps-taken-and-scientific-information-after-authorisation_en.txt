The efficacy and safety of immediate release exenatide was 
the results of Study H8O-MC-GWBQ (assessed by 
CHMP as part of PAM P46 048); a 28-week, 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of exenatide twice 
daily in 120 patients aged 10 to 17 years, and Study 
2993-124; a randomised, single-blind, placebo-
controlled, dose-rising study to evaluate the PK, PD 
and tolerability of exenatide in adolescent patients). 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to

data 
evaluated in a 28-week randomized, double-blind, placebo 
controlled study conducted in 120 patients aged 10 to 17 
years with type 2 diabetes who had HbA1c 6.5% to 10.5% 
and who were either naive to anti-diabetes agents or were 
treated with metformin alone, a sulfonylurea alone, or 
metformin in combination with a sulfonylurea. Patients 
received twice daily treatment with immediate release 
exenatide 5 µg, immediate release exenatide 10 µg or 
equivalent dose of placebo for 28 weeks. The primary 
efficacy endpoint was the change in HbA1c from baseline to 
28 weeks of treatment; the treatment difference (pooled 
doses) from placebo was not statistically significant [ 
0.28% (95% CI:  1.01, 0.45)]. No new safety findings were 
identified in this paediatric study.

comparator-controlled, non-inferiority study, which 
evaluated the safety and efficacy of BYETTA (n=315) 
versus titrated insulin lispro three times daily (n=312) on a 
background of optimized basal insulin glargine and 
metformin in patients with type 2 diabetes. 
Following a basal insulin optimization (BIO) phase, patients 
with HbA1c above 7.0% were randomized to add either 
BYETTA or insulin lispro to their existing regimen of insulin 
glargine and metformin. In both treatment groups, subjects 
continued to titrate their insulin glargine doses using an 
algorithm reflecting current clinical practice. 
All patients assigned to BYETTA initially received 5 mcg BID 
for four weeks. After four weeks, their dose was increased 
to 10 mcg BID. Patients in the BYETTA-treated group with 
an HbA1c of less than or equal to 8.0% at the end of the 
BIO phase decreased their insulin glargine dose by at least 
10%. 
BYETTA lowered HbA1c by 1.1% from a baseline of 8.3% 
and insulin lispro lowered HbA1c by 1.1% from a baseline 
of 8.2% and non-inferiority of BYETTA to titrated lispro was 
demonstrated. The proportion of patients achieving HbA1c

from a baseline of 89.3 kg was observed with insulin lispro. 
The safety data from the study are in line with the known 
safety profile of exenatide and has not given rise to any

Based upon the data that have become available since the

considers that the benefit-risk balance of Byetta

profile is to be closely monitored for the following reasons: 
A number of safety issues have been identified for Byetta, 
in particular the potential association between exenatide 
and pancreatic cancer and thyroid neoplasms. The latter 
will be further investigated in a new epidemiological study.  
Also the possible drug interaction between exenatide and 
tacrolimus and exenatide and lamotrigine needs further 
evaluation.  
In addition, the CHMP agreed on a common PSUR for 
Byetta and Bydureon (exenatide prolonged release 
formulation) following the timelines for PSUR frequency of 
Bydureon as required per Regulation 726/2004.  
Therefore, based upon the safety profile of Byetta, the 
CHMP concluded that the MAH should submit one additional 
renewal application in 5 years time.

to 15 subjects aged 45 to 65 years likely related to reduced 
renal function in the older age group. There was also a 
slight difference in weight between groups. Hence, the 
difference in renal function and weight might explain the 
difference in exposure between the groups. A combined 
analysis of PK data from 7 studies suggested that the 
relationship between exenatide clearance and creatinine 
clearance is similar for elderly and non-elderly subjects, 
indicating that there is no additional age-related decreased 
in clearance apart from that caused by reduced renal 
function in the elderly.   
Following assessment of these results the MAH submitted a 
type II variation to update the SPC. Subsequently section 
5.2 was updated with pharmacokinetic data in patients >75 
years.

information became available from clinical trials and post 
marketing experience. New data is related to safety 
information, particularly weight loss, alopecia and anti-
exenatide antibodies. Weight loss is well known effect 
associated with exenatide treatment. However, new data 
support that rapid weight loss may be harmful for some 
patients. MAH proposed to include relevant information in 
sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC. Further revision of CCDS 
suggested association between exenatide treatment and 
alopecia as well as development of anti-exenatide 
antibodies. As a result of these findings appropriate 
changes in section 4.8 of the SPC were proposed by MAH 
and accepted by CHMP. PL was also updates accordingly to 
reflect changes in SPC. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity of this variation to make an administrative

agreed by CHMP that observed increase in heart rate most 
likely is not of clinical relevance and therefore this 
information does not need to be added to SPC.

Section 4.4 was updated to emphasise the fact that 
serious, including fatal, cases of pancreatitis have been

blind, dose-rising, placebo-controlled, crossover study to 
evaluate the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and 
tolerability of exenatide in adolescent subjects with type 2 
diabetes mellitus'). 
In 13 patients with type 2 diabetes and between the ages 
of 12 and 16 years, administration of exenatide (5  g) 
resulted in slightly lower mean AUC (16% lower) and Cmax 
(25% lower) compared to those observed in adults.

The PK, PD and tolerability parameters determined in Study 
2993-124 were comparable to those previously observed in 
adults and likely attributable to similar body size of 
adolescents and adults with type 2 diabetes. From this 
study, it was concluded that no further PK and/or PD-based 
adjustments for age, weight, or other demographic factors 
are necessary.

requested to submit a type II variation regarding the renal 
safety of BYETTA. Sections 4.4 of the SPC have been 
updated to reflect that there have been rare, spontaneously 
reported events of altered renal function, including 
increased serum creatinine, renal impairment, worsened 
chronic renal failure and acute renal failure, sometimes 
requiring hemodialysis. Section 4.8 of the SPC has also 
been updated to reflect this undesirable effect. 
The SPC, sections 4.4 and 4.8 have also been updated to 
reflect acute pancreatitis. Section 4.4 of the SPC have been 
updated to include that there have been rare, 
spontaneously reported events of acute pancreatitis. 
Patients should be informed of the characteristic symptom 
of acute pancreatitis: persistent, severe abdominal pain. 
Resolution of pancreatitis has been observed with 
supportive treatment. If pancreatitis is suspected, BYETTA 
and other potentially suspect medicinal products should be 
discontinued. Section 4.8 have been updated to include 
acute pancreatitis.

and a combined oral contraceptive. This was an open label, 
three-period, three-sequence, randomised crossover study.  
The administration of a combination oral contraceptive (30 
µg ethinyl estradiol plus 150 µg levonorgestrel) one hour 
before BYETTA (10 µg BID) did not alter the AUC, Cmax or 
Cmin of either ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel. 
Administration of the oral contraceptive 30 minutes after 
BYETTA did not affect AUC but resulted in a reduction of 
the Cmax of ethinyl estradiol by 45%, and Cmax of 
levonorgestrel by 27-41%, and a delay in tmax by 2-4 h 
due to delayed gastric emptying. The reduction in Cmax is 
of limited clinical relevance and no adjustment of dosing of 
oral contraceptives is required. 
Based on these data the CHMP was also of the opinion that 
no specific recommendations with regards to the dose-
timing of oral contraceptives are required when taking 
BYETTA.

SUMMARY OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PLAN 
SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR HEMLIBRA (EMICIZUMAB) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Hemlibra. The RMP details 
important risks of Hemlibra, how these risks can be minimized, and how more 
information will be obtained about Hemlibra's risks and uncertainties (missing 
information). 
Hemlibra's Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and its Package Leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Hemlibra should 
be used.  
This summary of the RMP for Hemlibra should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the EPAR.  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Hemlibra's RMP. 
 I. THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
Hemlibra is authorized for use in adults and children with hemophilia A, with and without 
factor VIII inhibitors (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains emicizumab as the 
active substance and it is given by subcutaneous injection.  
Further information about the evaluation of Hemlibra’s benefits can be found in 
Hemlibra’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage. 
II. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO 
MINIMISE OR FURTHER CHARACTERISE THE RISKS 
Important risks of Hemlibra, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Hemlibra’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the Package Leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
  The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly; 
  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (e.g., 
with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. In the case of 
Hemlibra these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimization measures 
mentioned under relevant risks, below. 
  Guide for Healthcare Professionals 
  Patient Card 
  Patient/Carer Guide 
  Guide for Laboratory Professionals 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected 
continuously and regularly analyzed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of Hemlibra is not yet available; it is listed under ‘missing 
Information’ below. 
II.A  List of Important Risks and Missing Information 
Important risks of Hemlibra are risks that need special risk-management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medical product can be safely 
administered. Important risks can be regarded as either identified or potential. Identified 
risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Hemlibra. 
Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is 
possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information about the safety of the 
medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-
term use of the medicine).

Summary of Important Risks  
II.B 
Important Identified Risks 
Thromboembolic events (associated with emicizumab and aPCC): 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Evidence is based on the Phase III studies (BH29884, BH29992, 
BH30071, and BO39182; N  373), BO41423 (N=72) and the 
Phase I/II study (ACE002JP; N  18) of emicizumab, including 
adults, adolescents, and children with hemophilia A, both with and 
without FVIII inhibitors.  
Overall, 6.45% of patients (2/31) who received aPCC while on 
emicizumab prophylaxis across the Phase III studies had at least 
one event for this important identified risk of thromboembolic event 
(associated with emicizumab and aPCC); there were no patients 
(0/5; 0%) with such an event in Study ACE002JP. 
There were no thromboembolic events associated with aPCC 
reported from Study BO41423 as of CCOD (30 Oct 2021). 
There were two patients who experienced thromboembolic events 
in clinical trials while receiving emicizumab prophylaxis. Both 
patients received multiple doses of aPCC for the treatment of 
breakthrough bleeds just prior to developing symptoms. From 
additional analyses including data on thromboembolic and TMA 
events, the Sponsor concludes that there is sufficient evidence to 
support a DDI between aPCC and emicizumab. This interaction is 
primarily based on the dose and time interval over which aPCC is 
administered, with average cumulative doses of aPCC  
100 U/kg/24 hours for 24 hours or more associated with an 
increased risk for developing thromboembolic and TMA events.

Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Evidence is based on the Phase III studies (BH29884, BH29992, 
BH30071, and BO39182; N  373), BO41423 (N=72) and the 
Phase I/II study (ACE002JP; N  18) of emicizumab, including 
adults, adolescents, and children with hemophilia A, both with and 
without FVIII inhibitors.  
Overall, 9.68% of patients (3/31) who received aPCC while on 
emicizumab prophylaxis across the Phase III studies experienced 
this important identified risk of TMA (associated with emicizumab 
and aPCC); there were no patients (0/5; 0%) with such an even in 
Study ACE002JP. 
There were no thrombotic microangiopathy events reported from 
Study BO41423 as of CCOD (30 Oct 2021) 
No specific risk factors for TMA in hemophilia A patients were 
identified in the literature. However, all cases in the emicizumab 
clinical program occurred in patients who had taken average 
cumulative doses of aPCC  100 U/kg/24 hours for 24 hours or 
more while receiving emicizumab prophylaxis. 
Negative re-challenge for one patient restarting emicizumab after 
resolution of TMA without recurrence support the aforementioned 
observation as a potential etiology. 
From additional analyses including data on thromboembolic and 
TMA events, the Sponsor concludes that there is sufficient 
evidence to support a DDI between aPCC and emicizumab. This 
interaction is primarily based on the dose and time interval over 
which aPCC is administered, with average cumulative doses of 
aPCC  100 U/kg/24 hours for 24 hours or more associated with 
an increased risk for developing thromboembolic and TMA events.

Important Potential Risks 
Life-threatening bleeding due to misinterpretation of the standard 
coagulation tests, which are unreliable in patients treated with emicizumab 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
In vitro: Emicizumab’s mechanism of action and resulting 
interference was clearly demonstrated in the aPTT and in a 
wide variety of coagulation laboratory tests approved for in vitro 
diagnostic use. 
Clinical trials: Data from emicizumab clinical trials (Phase III 
studies BH29884, BH29992, BH30071, and BO39182, 
BO41423 and the Phase I/II Study ACE002JP) also 
demonstrated the effects of emicizumab on laboratory assays. 
However, no instances of under-treatment of bleeding events 
due to misinterpretation of the standard coagulation tests, 
which are unreliable in patients treated with emicizumab, were 
observed.  
Standard coagulation laboratory tests based on intrinsic 
clotting (aPTT, one-stage FVIII activity, including functional 
(clotting-based) assays for FVIII inhibitors (e.g., Bethesda 
assays)) are not reliable in the emicizumab setting and do not 
accurately reflect the patient’s underlying hemostatic status 
during emicizumab prophylaxis.  
There is a risk of life-threatening bleeding due to 
misinterpretation of the standard coagulation tests, which are 
unreliable in patients treated with emicizumab if a patient is 
treated by HCPs other than the emicizumab-prescribing HCP 
in settings such as an emergency room or in an acute care 
setting.

Anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid and systemic hypersensitivity reactions 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Evidence is based on data from the Phase III studies (BH29884, 
BH29992, BH30071 BO39182. BO41423, YO39309, MO39129, 
JO39881) and Phase I/II Study ACE002JPof emicizumab in 
hemophilia A patients, both with and without FVIII inhibitors. 
Anaphylaxis, anaphylactoid and systemic hypersensitivity reactions 
are typical potential class effects of subcutaneously administered 
monoclonal antibodies such as emicizumab.  
In the Phase I/II Study ACE002JP, 4 out of 18 patients tested 
positive for anti-emicizumab antibodies.  
A total of 34 patients from the Phase III studies had developed 
anti-emicizumab antibodies. There were neither anaphylaxis 
events nor severe hypersensitivity reactions related to 
development of anti-emicizumab antibodies across studies. 
Overall, the safety profile of emicizumab was similar between 
those patients with anti-emicizumab antibodies and those without. 
Therefore, these were categorized as important potential risks. 
Patients with previous history of anaphylaxis and atopic individuals 
are risk groups. 
Older age is a risk factor for death from drug-induced anaphylaxis; 
73% of all such deaths occurred in patients aged 55 to 85 years 
old (Liew WK et al. 2009). 
There is no single risk factor for the development of ADAs in the 
formation of circulating immune complexes resulting in generalized 
hypersensitivity reactions (Shankar et al. 2014, Steenholdt et al. 
2011).

Thromboembolic events not associated with concomitant use of aPCC 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Cumulated experience indicates that there is insufficient evidence 
for a causal relationship between emicizumab without concomitant 
use of aPCC and thromboembolic events (data cut off: 28 May 
2020). 
 
In the context of a cumulative post-marketing and clinical 
trial estimated exposure of 8973 patients worldwide, a 
cumulative search of the Roche Global Safety database 
(excluding events associated with aPCC) yielded 21 cases 
comprising 22 thromboembolic events. These cases were 
all reported in patients with predisposing comorbidities and 
would not be unexpected in the hemophilia A or general 
populations.   
  The incidence, proportion, and rate of thromboembolic 
events in clinical trials with emicizumab remain within the 
background incidence in the hemophilia A population (e.g., 
an incidence rate of 0.21 events per 100 patient-years in 
clinical trials with emicizumab vs. 0.51 events per 100 
patient-years1).  
The nonclinical data do not exclude the risk of thromboembolic 
events with emicizumab alone, but suggest that the risk is not 
higher from emicizumab administration.  The effect of emicizumab 
on thrombus formation was compared with the effect of rFVIIa and 
FVIII treatment in a model of venous stasis in normo-coagulative 
cynomolgus monkeys (Study PHM11-0008). Provoked thrombus 
formation by emicizumab was equal to the thrombus formation 
induced by either rFVIIa or FVIII. These results suggest that the 
 
 
 
risk of emicizumab causing thrombosis does not markedly exceed 
the risk of rFVIIa preparations or FVIII preparations causing 
thrombosis. In a second study of data from co-administration of 
emicizumab and bypassing agents (rFVIIa and aPCC) on thrombus 
formation in a cynomolgus monkey model of FVIII-deficient 
hemophilia A/venous stasis (Study PHM12-0023), no thrombosis 
formation was seen with emicizumab monotherapy. 
The available data from nonclinical data, clinical trials, literature, 
and real-world data sources do not support establishing a causal 
relationship.  
However with an increase in hemostatic potential as achieved with 
emicizumab, and as coagulation levels approach that of the 
general population, there is hypothetical plausibility that thrombotic 
risk might mirror that of the general population more closely (Barg 
et al. 2019). Additionally, some studies suggest that in the context 
of an aging hemophilia A population, with increased comorbidities, 
that there is a risk of cardiovascular disease (and thus thrombotic 
risk) similar to that of the general population (Wang 2016, 
Faghmous et al. 2019, Hofstede et al. 2008).   
Nonetheless, while emicizumab improves hemostasis closer to 
normal in a hemophilia A patient; hemostasis is not completely 
restored and remains below that of a healthy individual (e.g. 
typically restores to a mid-mild hemophilia phenotype).  
Since all thromboembolic events are closely monitored as part of 
additional pharmacovigilance activities, thromboembolic events not 
associated with concomitant use of aPCC have been formally 
reclassified as an important potential risk for completeness. This 
reclassification of the potential risk since the first RMP does not 
reflect a worsening of the benefit risk profile of emicizumab.   
Unique risk groups or risk factors have not been determined to 
date. The observed thromboembolic events (arterial, venous, 
device related) occurred in patients with relevant past medical 
history (e.g., underlying cardiovascular risk factors) and/or other 
contributing comorbidities.  
Without sufficient evidence to establish a causal relationship, the 
weighting of potential risk factors or group characteristics cannot 
yet be determined.

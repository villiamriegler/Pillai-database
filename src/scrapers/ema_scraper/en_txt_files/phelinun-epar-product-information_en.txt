CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
High-dose of PHELINUN used alone or in combination with other cytotoxic medicinal products and/or 
total body irradiation is indicated in the treatment of:  
-  multiple myeloma, 
-  malignant lymphoma (Hodgkin, non-Hodgkin lymphoma), 
- 
- 
- 
-  mammary adenocarcinoma.  
acute lymphoblastic and myeloblastic leukemia,  
childhood neuroblastoma, 
ovarian cancer, 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PHELINUN in combination with other cytotoxic medicinal products  is indicated as reduced intensity 
conditioning (RIC) treatment prior to allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) 
in malignant haematological diseases in adults.  
PHELINUN  in  combination  with  other  cytotoxic  medicinal  products  is  indicated  as  conditioning 
regimen prior to allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in haematological diseases in the 
paediatric population as: 
-  Myeloablative conditioning (MAC) treatment in case of malignant haematological diseases 
-  RIC treatment in case of non-malignant haematological diseases. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
PHELINUN  administration  must  be  supervised  by  a  physician  experienced  in  the  use  of 
chemotherapeutic medicinal products and in conditioning treatment prior to haematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation. 
Thromboembolic complications 
Thrombosis prophylaxis needs to be administered during at least the first 5 months of the treatment, in 
particular  to  patients  who  are  more  at  risk  of  thrombosis.  The  decision  to  take  antithrombotic 
prophylactic measures  needs  to  be taken after  a thorough  assessment  of  the  underlying  risks  for the 
individual patient (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Should  thromboembolic  complications  occur  for  the  patient,  treatment  needs  to  be  stopped  and  the 
standard  anticoagulant  therapy  needs  to  be  started.  As  soon  as  the  patient  is  stabilised  by  the 
anticoagulant  therapy  and  the  complications  of  the  thromboembolic  incident  are  under  control, 
melphalan can be used in combination with lenalidomide and prednisone, or thalidomide and prednisone 
or dexamethasone can be resumed in the original dose contingent on the assessment of the risks and 
benefits. The patient needs to continue the anticoagulant therapy during the melphalan treatment. 
Posology 
Adults 
Multiple myeloma, malignant lymphoma (Hodgkin, non-Hodgkin lymphoma), acute lymphoblastic and 
myeloblastic leukaemia (ALL and AML), ovarian cancer and mammary adenocarcinoma at a high-dose 
The  dose  regimen  is  as  follows:  one  dose  between  100  and  200 mg/m2  body  surface  area 
(approximatively  2.5  to  5.0 mg/kg  body  weight).  The  dose  can  be  divided  equally  over  2  or  3 
consecutive days. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is required following doses above 
140 mg/m2 body surface area.  
Malignant haematological diseases before allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
The  recommended  dose  is  140 mg/m2  as  a  single  daily  infusion  or  70 mg/m2  once  daily  for  two 
consecutive days. 
Paediatric population 
Acute lymphoblastic and myeloblastic leukaemia at high-dose 
The  dose  regimen  is  as  follows:  one  dose  between  100  and  200 mg/m2  body  surface  area 
(approximatively  2.5  to  5.0 mg/kg  body  weight).  The  dose  can  be  divided  equally  over  2  or  3 
consecutive days. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is required following doses above 
of 140 mg/m2 body surface area.  
Childhood neuroblastoma 
The recommended dose to consolidate a response obtained with a conventional treatment is one single 
dose  between  100 mg/m2  and  240  mg/m2  body  surface  area  (sometimes  divided  equally  over  3 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
consecutive days) together with autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The infusion is 
used either alone or in combination with radiotherapy and/or other cytotoxic medicinal products.  
Haematological diseases before allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
The recommended dose is as follows:  
-  malignant haematological diseases: 140 mg/m2 as a single daily infusion; 
-  non-malignant haematological diseases: 140 mg/m2 as a single daily infusion or 70 mg/m2 once 
daily for two consecutive days. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
There is no dose recommendation for the administration of PHELINUN to elderly. 
However, frequently conventional doses of melphalan are applied in the elderly. 
Experience  in  the  use  of  high  dose  melphalan  in  elderly  patients  is  limited.  Consideration  should 
therefore be given to ensure adequate performance status and organ function, before using high dose 
melphalan in elderly patients. 
Renal impairment 
The posology should be adjusted in patients with renal impairment (see section 4.4). 
The clearance of melphalan, although variable, may be reduced with impaired renal function. 
High-dose melphalan with haematopoietic stem cell rescue has been used successfully even in dialysis 
dependent patients with end-stage renal failure. 
For  high  intravenous  doses  of  melphalan  (100  to  240 mg/m2  body  surface  area),  the  need  for  dose 
reduction  depends  upon  the  degree  of  renal  impairment,  whether  haematopoietic  stem  cells  are 
re-infused, and the therapeutic need. Melphalan injection should not be given without haematopoietic 
stem cell rescue at doses above 140 mg/m2. 
Method of administration  
PHELINUN is for intravenous use only.  
Risk of extravasation could be observed when PHELINUN is administered via peripheral intravenous 
route.  In  case  of  extravasation,  the  administration  should  be  interrupted  immediately  and  a  central 
venous line route should be used. 
If high-dose PHELINUN is administered with or without transplantation, the administration as dilution 
via a central venous line is recommended to avoid extravasation.  
It is recommended that PHELINUN as concentrate (5 mg/ml) is injected slowly into the port of a fast-
running infusion solution.  
If  the  injection  of  the  concentrate  (5 mg/ml)  slowly  into  a  fast-running  infusion  solution  is  not 
appropriate,  PHELINUN  may  be  administered  further  diluted  with  sodium  chloride  9 mg/ml (0.9%) 
solution for injection in a “slow-running” solution in a infusion bag. The total time from preparation of 
the solution to the completion of infusion should not exceed 1 hour and 30 minutes. When further diluted 
in an infusion solution, PHELINUN has reduced stability and the  rate of degradation increases rapidly 
with rise in temperature. 
It is recommended to let the infusion run at a temperature below 25°C. 
Precaution to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product 
The  preparation  of  injectable  cytotoxic  solutions  must  be  carried  out  by  qualified  healthcare 
professionals  with  knowledge  of  alkylating  agents  handling,  under  conditions  that  ensure  the 
environment protection and the healthcare professional safety. 
PHELINUN should be prepared for use in a dedicated preparation area. Healthcare professionals must 
have  a  suitable  equipment,  including  long-sleeved  clothes,  face  protection,  protective  caps,  safety 
goggles, sterile disposable gloves, worktop protection shields, containers and bags for collecting waste. 
Any  broken  container  should  be  treated  with  the  same  precautions  and  considered  as  contaminated 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
waste. Excreta and vomit must be handled with care. Pregnant staff should be warned and avoid handling 
PHELINUN.  
If PHELINUN accidentally contacts the skin, this must be immediately washed thoroughly with soap 
and water.  
In case of accidental contact with the eyes or mucous membranes, rinse abundantly with water. 
Inhalation of the product should be avoided.  
Remnants of the medicinal product as well as all materials that have been used for reconstitution and 
administration must be disposed of according to standard procedures applicable to cytotoxic products, 
with due regard to local requirements related to the disposal of hazardous waste. 
For  instructions  on  reconstitution  and  dilution  of  the  medicinal  product  before  administration,  see 
section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
-  Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
-  Pregnancy (only with respect to the treatment prior to HSCT) and breat-feeding (see section 
4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Melphalan can cause local tissue damage. Should extravasation occur, it should not be administered by 
direct injection into a peripheral vein (see section 4.2). 
PHELINUN  should  be  used  with  caution  in  patients  who  have  undergone  recent  radiotherapy  or 
chemotherapy in view of increased bone marrow toxicity. 
Hepatic veno-occlusive disease is a major complication that can occur during treatment with melphalan. 
Patients who have received prior radiation therapy greater than or equal to three cycles of chemotherapy, 
or prior progenitor cell transplant may be at an increased risk (see section 4.8). 
Monitoring 
Since melphalan is a potent myelosuppressive agent, it is essential that careful attention is paid to the 
monitoring  of  blood  counts  to  avoid  the  possibility  of  excessive  myelosuppression  and  the  risk  of 
irreversible bone marrow aplasia or irreversible bone marrow failure. 
Cytopenia may continue to fall after treatment is stopped. So, at the first sign of an abnormally, large 
fall in leukocyte or severe thrombocytopenia, treatment should be temporarily interrupted. 
It  is  recommended  to  ensure  patients’  adequate  hydration  and  forced  diuresis  and  the  prophylactic 
administration of anti-infective agents (bacterial fungal, viral). The administration of blood products 
should be considered if required. 
It  is  recommended  to  monitor  the  general  and  renal  status  of  patients  receiving  high-doses  of 
PHELINUN. 
The incidence of diarrhoea, vomiting and stomatitis becomes the dose-limiting toxicity in patients given 
high  intravenous  doses  of  PHELINUN  in  association  with  autologous  bone  marrow  transplantation. 
Cyclophosphamide pre-treatment appears to reduce the severity of gastrointestinal damage induced by 
high-dose PHELINUN and the literature should be consulted for details. 
Mutagenicity  
Melphalan is mutagenic in animals and chromosome aberrations have been observed in patients being 
treated with the medicinal product. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Carcinogenicity 
Acute myeloide leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes. 
Melphalan has been reported to be leukaemogenic (acute leukemia and myelodysplastic syndromes). 
There have been reports of acute leukaemia occurring after melphalan treatment for diseases such as 
amyloid, malignant melanoma, multiple myeloma, macroglobulinaemia, cold agglutinin syndrome and 
ovarian cancer. 
The leukaemogenic risk must be balanced against the potential therapeutic benefit when considering the 
use  of  melphalan,  in  particular  when  used  in  combination  with  thalidomide  or  lenalidomide  and 
prednisone, as it has been determined that these combinations increase the leukaemogenic risk. Before, 
during and after treatment the doctor needs to examine the patients with the usual checks to detect cancer 
early and start treatment if necessary. 
Solid tumors 
The use of alkylating agents has been linked to the development of a second primary malignancy (SPM). 
In particular when melphalan is used in combination with lenalidomide and prednisone, and to a lesser 
extent in combination with thalidomide and prednisone, it has been linked to an increased chance of 
solid SPM for elderly patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. 
Thromboembolic complications 
The  use  of  melphalan  in  combination  with  lenalidomide  and  prednisone  or  thalidomide  or 
dexamethasone has been associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic complications. 
Especially in patients with increased risk factors for thrombosis, antithrombotic prophylactic measures 
need to be taken into consideration (see section 4.2 and 4.8). 
Renal impairment 
Since patients with renal impairment may have marked bone marrow suppression, these patients should 
be closely monitored. 
Melphalan clearance may be reduced in patients with renal impairment who may also have uraemic 
marrow suppression. Dose reduction may therefore be necessary and these patients should be closely 
controlled (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of melphalan followed by allo-HSCT in children below the age of 2 years with 
AML has not been established because safety and overall survival (OS) data are not reported separately 
for this age category (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
The safety and efficacy of melphalan as part of the conditioning regimen prior to allo-HSCT in children 
below the age of 2 years with ALL has not been established. 
Melphalan  should  not  be  used  in  adolescents  over  the  age  of  12 years  with  AML  as  conditioning 
treatment  followed  by  allo-HSCT  because  of  an  increased  rate  of  transplant-related  mortality  (see 
section 5.1). 
Ethanol  
PHELINUN 50 mg powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion 
This medicinal product contains 0.4  g of alcohol (ethanol) in each solvent vial which is equivalent to 
42 mg/ml (0.42% w/v). The amount in 10 ml of this medicine is equivalent to 10 ml beer or 4 ml wine. 
PHELINUN 200 mg powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion 
This medicinal product contains 1.6 g of alcohol (ethanol) in each solvent vial which is equivalent to 
42 mg/ml (0.42 % w/v). The amount in 40 ml of this medicine is equivalent to 40 ml beer or 17 ml wine.  
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For comparison, for an adult drinking a glass of wine or 500 ml of beer, the BAC is likely to be about 
50 mg/100 ml. 
Co-administration  with  medicinal  products  containing  propylene  glycol  or  ethanol  may  lead  to 
accumulation of ethanol and induce adverse effects, in particular in young children with low or immature 
metabolic capacity. 
Adults  
A dose of 200 mg/m2 of this medicine administered to adult weighing 70 kg would result in exposure to 
40 mg/kg  of  ethanol  which  may  cause  a  rise  in  blood  alcohol  concentration  (BAC)  of  about 
6.67 mg/100 ml. 
The amount of alcohol in this medicine is not likely to have an effect in adults. 
Children and adolescents 
A dose of 240 mg/m2 of this medicine administered to a child 8 years of age and weighing 30 kg would 
result in exposure to 76.8 mg/kg of ethanol which may cause a rise in blood alcohol concentration (BAC) 
of about 12.8 mg/100 ml. 
A dose of 240 mg/m2 of this medicine administered to an adolescent 12 years of age and weighing 40 kg 
would result in exposure to 110 mg/kg of ethanol which may cause a rise in blood alcohol concentration 
(BAC) of about 18.3 mg/100 ml. 
The alcohol in this preparation is likely to affect children and adolescents. These effects may include 
feeling sleepy and changes in behaviour. It may also affect their ability to concentrate and take part in 
physical activities. 
To be taken into account in children and adolescents and high risk groups such as patients with liver 
disease or epilepsy. 
Propylene glycol 
PHELINUN 50  mg powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion 
This medicinal product contains 6.2 g propylene glycol in each 10 ml of solvent which is equivalent to 
0.62  g/ml. 
PHELINUN 200  mg powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion 
This medicinal product contains 24.9 g propylene glycol in each 40 ml of solvent which is equivalent to 
0.62 g/ml. 
Co-administration with any substrate for alcohol dehydrogenase such as ethanol may induce serious 
adverse effects in children less than 5 years old. 
While propylene glycol has not been shown to cause reproductive or developmental toxicity in animals 
or humans, it may reach the foetus and was found in milk. As a consequence, administration of propylene 
glycol to pregnant or lactating patients should be considered on a case by case basis. 
Medical  monitoring  is  required  in  patients  with  impaired  renal  or  hepatic  functions  because  various 
adverse events attributed to propylene glycol have been reported such as renal dysfunction (acute tubular 
necrosis), acute renal failure and liver dysfunction. 
With high doses or prolonged use of propylene glycol have been reported various adverse events, such 
as  hyperosmolality,  lactic  acidosis;  renal  dysfunction  (acute  tubular  necrosis),  acute  renal  failure; 
cardiotoxicity (arrhythmia, hypotension); central nervous system disorders (depression, coma, seizures); 
respiratory depression, dyspnoea; liver dysfunction; haemolytic reaction (intravascular haemolysis) and 
haemoglobinuria; or multisystem organ dysfunction. 
Adverse events usually reverse following weaning off of propylene glycol, and in more severe cases 
following hemodialysis. 
Medical monitoring is required.

Sodium  
PHELINUN 50  mg powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially 
“sodium free”.  
PHELINUN 200  mg powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion 
This medicinal product contains 62.52 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 3% of the WHO recommended 
maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Nalidixic acid  
The administration of high-dose intravenous PHELINUN together with nalidixic acid in children has 
caused haemorrhagic entercolitis with fatal outcome.  
Busulfan  
In  the  paediatric  population,  for  the  busulfan-melphalan  regimen  it  has  been  reported  that  the 
administration of melphalan less than 24 hours after the last oral busulfan administration may influence 
the development of toxicities. 
Cyclosporin 
Impaired  renal  function  has  been  described  in  bone  marrow  transplant  patients  who  were 
pre-conditioned  with  high-dose  intravenous  melphalan  and  subsequently  received  cyclosporin  to 
prevent graft versus host disease. 
Attenuated live vaccines 
A risk of general illness which may lead to fatal outcome has described. This risk is increased in patients 
who are already immunosuppressed by their underlying disease. An inactivated vaccines should be used 
when such a vaccine exists (poliomyelitis). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation  
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
As with all cytotoxic treatments, male and female patients that receive melphalan should use effective 
reliable contraceptive methods up until six months after cessation of treatment. 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of melphalan in pregnant women. Studies in animals 
have shown reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). Risk for human is not know, but due to the mutagenic 
properties and structural similarity of melphalan with known teratogenic compounds, it is possible that 
melphalan can induce congenital malformations in offspring of treated patients.  
The use of melphalan as anti-cancer treatment should be avoided whenever possible during pregnancy, 
particularly during the first trimester. In each case, the benefit of the treatment outweighing the potential 
risk to the fetus should be evaluated. 
HSCT is contraindicated in pregnant women. Therefore melphalan is contraindicated during pregnancy 
for this indication (see section 4.3). 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether melphalan or its metabolites are excreted in human milk. Due to its mutagenic 
properties, melphalan is contraindicated during breast-feeding (see section 4.3). 
Fertility 
Melphalan causes suppression of ovarian function in pre-menopausal women resulting in amenorrhoea 
in a significant number of patients. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There is evidence from animal studies that melphalan can have an adverse effect on spermatogenesis 
(see section 5.3). Therefore, it is possible that melphalan may cause temporary or permanent sterility in 
male patients. Cryopreservation of semen before treatment is advised. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Melphalan  has  moderate  influence  on  the  ability  to  drive  and  use  machines.  It  is  likely  that  certain 
adverse  reactions  of  melphalan,  like  nausea  and  vomiting,  could  affect  this  ability.  This  medicinal 
product also contains alcohol, which is likely to affect children and adolescents (see section 4.4). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile  
The most frequently reported adverse reactions were haematologic and gastrointestinal toxicities, and 
immune  system  disorders,  these  being  considered  as  expected  consequences  of  myelosuppression.   
Infections, acute and chronic Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) were reported as the major causes of 
morbidity  and  mortality  in  the  allo  HSCT  setting.  Bone  marrow  failure,  stomatitis,  mucosal 
inflammation, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, amenorrhoea, ovarian disorders 
and premature menopause were also commonly reported.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The adverse drug reactions (ADRs) described in this section were identified from information included 
in  other  melphalan  containing  products,  the  screening  of  the  published  literature  and  the  European 
database  EudraVigilance  concerning  the  use  of melphalan  as  part  of combination  regimens  for allo-
HSCT  setting.  With  the  exception  of  Stevens-Johnson  syndrome  and  Toxic  epidermal  necrolysis 
identified for only one patient, ADRs reported for at least two patients have been captured in the table 
below.  
Frequencies are described as very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100 to <1/10), uncommon (≥1/1,000 
to <1/100), rare (≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), very rare (<1/10,000), and not known (cannot be estimated 
from the available data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of 
decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Infections and GvHD although not directly related to melphalan, were the major causes of morbidity 
and mortality, especially in the setting of allogeneic transplantation. 
Infections and infestations 
All  patients  in  the  target  population  are  at  risk  of  infections  due  to  their  immunodeficient  status. 
Myelosuppression  and  immunosuppressive  effects  induced  by  melphalan  may  facilitate  the 
development of infections which may have fatal outcome in the most severe manifestations. Adoption 
of prohylactic measures such as the administration of anti-infective agents can be useful. 
Graft versus host disease  
GvHD is a very common complication in the allogeneic HSCT setting. Up to # 60% patients develop 
acute and/or chronic GvHD. The severity of GvHD may vary from mild to fatal in the most severe 
manifestations of the disease.  
The occurrence of GvHD can be prevented by using immunosuppressive therapy after haematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation as prophylaxis.

Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders 
On  the  basis  of the identified  safety reports in the  literature,  the  paediatric  population  appears  more 
susceptible  to  develop  respiratory  complications  than  adults.  In  particular,  fatal  respiratory 
complications were reported as higher for infants below 2 years than for children and adolescents.  
Gastrointestinal disorders 
On  the  basis  of the identified  safety reports in the  literature,  the  paediatric  population  appears  more 
susceptible to develop gastrointestinal complications. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are 
asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms and signs 
Gastro-intestinal effects, including nausea and vomiting are the most likely signs of acute intravenous 
overdose. Damage to the gastro-intestinal mucosa may also occur. Diarrhoea, sometimes haemorrhagic, 
has been reported after intravenous overdose. The principal toxic effect is bone marrow suppression, 
leading to anaemia, neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. 
Treatment 
There is no specific antidote. The blood picture should be closely monitored for at least four weeks 
following overdose until there is evidence of recovery. 
The  treatment  should  be  symptomatic:  blood  transfusion,  antibiotic  therapy,  haematopoietic  growth 
factors if necessary.

Melphalan  is  a  bifunctional  alkylating  agent  that  prevents  the  separation  and  replication  of  DNA. 
Formation of carbonium intermediates from each of the two bis-2-chloroethyl groups enables alkylation 
through covalent binding with the 7-nitrogen of guanine on DNA, cross-linking the two DNA strands 
and thereby preventing cell replication. 
Clinical safety and efficacy  
Documentation on the safety and efficacy of PHELINUN in combination with other cytotoxic medicinal 
products derives from literature review. In total the studies report efficacy results for 3,096 patients of 
whom  607  were  from  studies  reporting  results  only  in  the  paediatric  population  (under  the  age  of 
18 years). Endpoints in these studies were overall survival (OS), disease-free survival (DFS), event-free 
survival (EFS) and non-relapse mortality (NRM).The results of published clinical studies supporting the 
efficacy of melphalan are summarised below divided between adult and pediatric population.

Adults 
Baron et al., 2015 
This retrospective study, performed by the Acute Leukemia Working Party of the European Group for 
Blood and Marrow Transplantation, compared the outcomes for a cohort of 394 AML patients receiving 
a sibling HSCT after fludarabine-busulfan (n=218) or fludarabine-melphalan (n=176). Busulfan dose 
was ranging from 7.1 to 8.9 mg/kg [oral] or from 6.0 to 6.9 mg/kg [intravenous]; melphalan dose was 
ranged between 130 to 150 mg/m2. Both are considered RIC. 
There was a statistically significant reduction in relapse risk at 2 years for fludarabine-melphalan (FM) 
versus fludarabine-busulfan (FB) in AML patients (FM 20%, FB 30%; p=0.007) which was confirmed 
in multivariate analysis (HR 0.5, 95%CI 0.3-0.8, p=0.01). 
Kawamura et al., 2017 
This retrospective study performed in Japan compared the transplant outcomes of patients aged 50 years 
or  older  with  AML,  ALL  or  MDS  after  fludarabine  with  melphalan  (140 mg/m2  i.v.)  (FM,  n=423), 
fludarabine  with  intermediate  doses  of  busulfan  (6.4 mg/kg  i.v.)  (FB2,  n=463)  and  fludarabine  with 
higher doses of busulfan (12.8 mg/kg i.v.) (FB4, n=721). FM and FB2 are considered RIC-regimens and 
FB4  is  considered  a  MAC  regimen.  There  was  a  statistically  significant  reduction  in  relapse  risk  at 
3 years  for  fludarabine-melphalan  versus  fludarabine-busulfan 
in 
AML/ALL/MDS patients (FM 27.4%, FB2 37.2%; p=0.0027), confirmed in multivariate analysis (HR 
0.56, 95% CI 0.42-0.74, p<0.001). 
intermediate  dose  (FB2) 
Eom et al., 2013 
This case-control study performed in South Korea in high-risk ALL patients in first or second complete 
remission, compared outcomes after RIC (melphalan 140 mg/m2 and fludarabine 150 mg/m2; n=60) or 
MAC  (TBI  13,2  Gy  +  cyclophosphamide  120 mg/kg;  n=120)  allo-HSCT.  OS  rate  at  5 years  for 
fludarabine-melphalan was 54.5%. There was no statistically significant difference in OS-rate at 5 years 
for  fludarabine-melphalan  versus  TBI-cyclophosphamide  in  high-risk  ALL  patients,  despite 
RIC-patients  being  older  or  having  more  co-morbidities  and  therefore  ineligible  for  myeloablative 
conditioning. 
Paediatric population 
Malignant haematological diseases 
Three retrospective studies demonstrated the safety and efficacy of PHELINUN in combination with 
other cytotoxic medicinal products prior to allogeneic HPCT in the paediatric population with malignant 
haematological diseases including AML and MDS. 
Lucchini et al. 2017 
This retrospective study, performed by the Acute Leukemia Working Party of the European Group for 
Blood  and  Marrow  Transplantation,  compared  the  outcomes  for  children  > 2  to <18 years  of  age 
undergoing a first allogeneic HSCT from a matched sibling or unrelated donor for AML in CR1 after 
either  Busulfan-Cyclophosphamide-Melphalan  (140 mg/m2)  (n=133),  Busulfan-Cyclophosphamide 
(n=389) or TBI-cyclophosphamide (n=109). All are considered MAC. 
in  relapse  rate  at  5 years  for  busulfan-
There  was  a  statistically  significant  reduction 
cyclophosphamide-melphalan 
and 
versus 
busulfan-cyclophosphamide (BuCy): (BuCyMel 14.7%, TBICy 30%, BuCy 31.5%; p<0.01) confirmed 
in multivariate analysis (OR 0.44, 95% CI 0.25-0.80; p<0.01). 
OS-rate and NRM-rate at 5 years for the BuCyMel regimen were 76.6% and 10.8%, with no statistically 
significant differences between groups in OS or NRM-rate at 5 years in multivariate analysis. 
TBI-cyclophosphamide 
(BuCyMel) 
(TBICy) 
Locatelli et al., 2015 
This retrospective study, performed by the AIEOP group analysed the results of 143 children including 
39  patients  between  0-1  years  of  age  and  17  between  1-2  years  who  were  given  an  allo-HSCT  for 
consolidating remission after achievement of CR1 in AML. The conditioning regimen was busulfan, 
cyclophosphamide and melphalan (140 mg/m2).  
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In a subgroup analysis of different age categories (<1 year, 1-2 year, 2-10 year, >10 year) there was no 
statistically significant difference in disease-free survival at 8 years. Analysis of the association of age 
and the endpoints OS and TRM was not reported. 
Strahm et al., 2011 
This retrospective study, performed by the European Working Group of MDS in Childhood, analysed 
97  children  with  MDS  treated  with  an  allo-HSCT  following  induction  by  BuCyMel  (melphalan 
140 mg/m2 single dose). OS-rate was 63%, EFS-rate was 59% and relapse rate was 21% at 5 years.  
The study by Lucchini et al., 2017, did not include children below the age of two, and the study by 
Locatelli  et  al.,  2015,  did  not  report  OS,  safety  data  and  TRM  separately  for  this  age  category. 
Furthermore, in the study by Sauer et al., 2019, assessing the BuCyMel regimen in children with AML, 
TRM correlated with age with a rate of 9% in children younger than 12 years and 31% in older children 
and adolescents. Therefore, safety and efficacy in children <2 years of age with AML have not been 
established and melphalan should not be used in children with AML >12 years of age (see section 4.4). 
Non-malignant haematological diseases 
Ten  studies  assessed  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  PHELINUN  in  combination  with  other  cytotoxic 
medicinal  products  prior  to  allogeneic  HSCT  in  a  total  of  504  patients  including  the  paediatric 
population  (age  range  2  months  –  18  years)  with  non  malignant  haematological  diseases  including 
thalassaemia,  sickle-cell  disease,  hemophagocytic 
lymphohistiocytosis  (HLH)  and  X-linked 
lymphoproliferative disease, combined immune deficiency and common variable immunodeficiency, 
severe  combined  immune  deficiency  (SCID),  non-Fanconi  anaemia  marrow  failure  disorders  and 
metabolic disorders. 
Most studies used a RIC-regimen of alemtuzumab, fludarabine and melphalan 140 mg/m2. The largest 
study was performed by Marsh et al. 2015. 
Marsh et al. 2015 
In  this  restrospective  study  on  allo-HSCT  in  non-malignant  haematological  diseases,  210  children 
received a RIC regimen of alemtuzumab, fludarabine, and melphalan 140 mg/m2. The OS reported at 1 
year  was  78%  and  at  3  years  was  69%.  Three-year  EFS  was  84%  for  patients  who  underwent 
transplantation with an HLA-matched related donor compared with 64%, 57% and 14% for patients who 
underwent  transplantation  with  a  matched  unrelated  donor,  1  allele  mismatched  donor,  or  2  allele 
mismatched donor, respectively (P < .001). Five % of patients required retransplantation due to graft 
loss. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
The absorption of oral melphalan is highly variable with respect to both the time to first appearance of 
the medicinal product in plasma and peak plasma concentration.  
In studies of the absolute bioavailability of melphalan, the mean absolute bioavailability ranged from 
56 to 85%.  
Intravenous administration can be used to avoid variability in absorption associated with myeloablative 
treatment. 
Distribution 
Melphalan is distributed in most tissues of the body. It is moderately bound to plasma proteins with 
reported binding ranging from 69% to 78%. There is evidence that the protein binding is linear in the 
range  of  plasma  concentrations  usually  achieved in  standard  dose therapy, but that  the  binding  may 
become concentration-dependent at the concentrations observed in high-dose therapy. Serum albumin 
is the major binding protein, accounting for about 55 to 60% the binding, and 20% is bound to α1-acid 
glycoprotein.  In  addition,  melphalan  binding  studies  have  revealed  the  existence  of  an  irreversible 
component attributable to the alkylation reaction with plasma proteins.  
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
In 28 patients with various malignancies who were given doses between 70 and 200 mg/m2 body surface 
area as a 2 to 20 min infusion, the mean volumes of distribution at steady state and central compartment 
were, respectively, 40.2 ± 18.3 litres and 18.2 ± 11.7 litres. 
Melphalan displays limited penetration of the blood-brain barrier. Several investigators have sampled 
cerebrospinal fluid and found no measurable medicinal product. Low cerebrospinal fluid concentrations 
(~10% of that in plasma) were observed in a single high-dose study in children.  
Biotrasformation  
The chemical hydrolysis of melphalan to monohydroxymelphalan and dihydroxy melphalan is the most 
important metabolic route in humans. These metabolites are inactive. 
In vivo and in vitro data suggest that spontaneous degradation rather than enzymatic metabolism is the 
major determinant of the medicinal product's half-life in man.  
Elimination 
In 15 children and 11 adults given high-dose intravenous melphalan (140 mg/m2 body surface area) with 
forced  diuresis,  the  mean  initial  and  terminal  half-lives  were  found  to  be  6.5  ±  3.6 min  and  41.4 ± 
16.5 min,  respectively.  Mean  initial  and  terminal  half-lives  of  8.8  ±  6.6  min  and  73.1  ±  45.9  min, 
respectively, were recorded in 28 patients with various malignancies who were given doses of between 
70  and  200 mg/m2  body  surface  area  as  a  2 to  20 min  infusion.  The  mean  clearance  was  564.6  ± 
159.1 ml/min.  
Special populations  
Renal impairment 
Melphalan clearance may be decreased in renal impairment (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Elderly 
No  correlation  has  been  shown  between  age  and  melphalan  clearance  or  with  melphalan  terminal 
elimination half-life (see section 4.2). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Mutagenicity 
Melphalan was mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium. Melphalan caused chromosomal aberrations in 
vitro (mammalian cells) and in vivo (rodents).  
Clinical information on potential toxicity of melphalan is provided in sections 4.4 and 4.6. 
Carcinogenicity  
Melphalan, in common with other alkylating agents, has been reported to be leukaemogenic. There have 
been  reports  of  acute  leukaemia  occurring  after  melphalan  treatment  for  diseases  such  as  amyloid, 
malignant melanoma, multiple myeloma, macroglobulinaemia, cold agglutinin syndrome and ovarian 
cancer. 
The potential therapeutic benefit when considering the use of melphalan must be balanced against the 
risk that may occur. 
Reproductive toxicity and fertility  
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Melphalan was teratogenic in rats after single dose exposure in reproductive toxicity studies. In repeated 
dose reproductive toxicity studies, melphalan was maternal toxic and induced congenital malformations. 
A single dose of melphalan in male mice induced cytotoxicity and chromosomal aberrations in sperm 
cells. In female mice a reduction in number of pups per litter was observed. After recovery, the number 
of pups per litter was also reduced over time, which was related to a reduced number of follicles.

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Preparation of PHELINUN solution 
The powder should be reconstituted immediately after opening the vial.  
PHELINUN should be prepared at a temperature below 25°C, by reconstituting the freeze-dried powder 
with 10 ml or 40 ml solvent and immediately shaking vigorously until a clear solution, without visible 
particles, is obtained. Only clear solution free from particles should be used. 
Unless  the  concentrate  is  administered  into  a  fast-running  infusion  solution  via  injection  port,  the 
reconstituted solution must be further diluted prior to administration with an appropriate volume of sodium 
chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection in order to obtain a final concentration between 0.45 and 
4.0 mg/ml. 
PHELINUN concentrate and solution have limited stability and should be prepared immediately before 
use.  
The  maximum  time  between  reconstitution  and  dilution  of  the  solution  in  sodium  chloride 
9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection and the end of the infusion is 1 hour 30 minutes.  
Handling and disposal 
The  procedures  for  the  safe  handling  and  disposal  of  antineoplastic  agents  must  be  followed  by 
healthcare professionals or medical personnel and should comply with the current recommendations for 
cytotoxic medicinal products (see section 4.2).  
Any  unused  medicinal  product  or  waste  material  should  be  disposed  of  in  accordance  with  local 
requirements.

1.  What PHELINUN is and what it is used for 
PHELINUN  contains  the  active  substance  called  melphalan  which  belongs  to  a  group  of  medicines 
called cytotoxics (also called chemotherapy) and it works by reducing the number of certain cells.  
PHELINUN can be used, alone or in combination with other medicines or with total body irradiation 
for the treatment of:  
•  different types of bone marrow cancer: multiple myeloma, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (also 
called acute lymphocytic leukaemia ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)  
•  malignant  lymphoma  (Hodgkin  lymphoma  and  non-Hodgkin  lymphoma)  -  cancer  that  affects 
some types of white blood cells called lymphocytes (cells that fight against infections) 
•  neuroblastoma, a type of cancer that grows from abnormal nerve cells in the body  
•  advanced cancer of the ovaries 
•  advanced breast cancer  
PHELINUN  is  also  used,  in  combination  with  other  cytotoxic  medicines,  as  a  preparation  medicine 
before blood stem cell transplantation to treat cancer of the blood in adults and cancer and non-cancerous 
disorders of the blood in the paediatric population. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given PHELINUN 
If you have any doubts, do not hesitate to ask your doctor for advice. 
You must not be given PHELINUN 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to melphalan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6) 
if you are pregnant (only with respect to the treatment prior to blood stem cell transplantation) 
or breast-feeding. 
Warnings and precautions  
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you are going to be treated with melphalan careful monitoring of the blood will be performed as this 
medicine is a potent cytotoxic that results in profound decrease of blood cells. 
Before treatment with melphalan, tell your doctor if any of the following apply to you:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if you have had recent radiotherapy or cancer medicines because they frequently decrease the 
number of blood cell levels; 
if you have signs of an infection (fever, chills, etc.). In case of treatment with melphalan, your 
doctor  may  prescribe  medicines  such  as  antibiotics,  antifungals  or  antivirals  to  prevent 
infections. Your doctor may also consider giving you blood products (for example, red blood 
cells and platelets); 
if you are going to have a vaccination or were recently vaccinated. This is because some live 
attenuated vaccines (like polio, measles, mumps and rubella) may give you an infection while 
you are being treated with melphalan; 
if you have kidney problems or kidney failure (your kidneys don’t work well enough). In this 
case the dose of PHELINUN must be reduced; 
if you ever had a blood clot in your vein (thrombosis). The use of melphalan in combination 
with lenalidomide and prednisone or thalidomide or dexamethasone may increase the risk of 
development of blood clots. Your doctor can decide to give you medication to prevent the latter 
from happening.  
Adequate  hydration  and  forced  diuresis  (large  volume  of  fluids  given  in  the  vein  by  a  drip)  is 
recommeded when you are given melphalan. 
Children and adolescents  
Children  and  adolescents  may  be  more  likely  to  develop  serious  breathing  and  gastrointestinal 
complications. Tell your doctor or nurse at once if any breathing or gastrointestinal disturbances occur. 
Melphalan  should  not  be  used  as  a  preparation  medicine  before  blood  stem  cell  transplantation,  in 
adolescents over the age of 12 years with acute myeloid leukaemia. 
Safety  and  efficacy  of  the  use  of  melphalan  as  a  preparation  medicine  before  blood  stem  cell 
transplantation  in  children  less  than  2 years  for  the  treatment  of  acute  myeloid  leukaemia  and  acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia has not been established. 
Other medicines and PHELINUN 
Tell  your  doctor  or  nurse  if  you  are  taking  or  have  recently  taken  any  other  medicines  including 
medicines obtained without a prescription. 
In particular, tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any of the following: 
•  other cytotoxic medicines (chemotherapy) 
•  vaccination or you have been recently vaccinated (see warnings and precautions) because of 
possible general illness which may lead to a fatal outcome  
•  nalidixic acid (an antibiotic used to treat urinary tract infections). It can cause haemorrhagic 
enterocolitis with fatal outcome in children when given in combination with melphalan 
•  busulfan  (used  to  treat  a  certain  type  of  cancer).  In  children,  it  has  been  reported  that  the 
administration of melphalan less than 24 hours after the last oral busulfan administration may 
influence the development of toxicities. 
Cases of impaired renal function have been reported when cyclosporin is used to prevent graft-versus-
host disease after blood stem cell transplantion.  
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor for advice before you receive this medicine. 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy 
Blood  stem  cell  transplantation  is  contraindicated  in  pregnant  woman.  For  the  other  indications, 
treatment  with  melphalan  is  not  recommended  during  pregnancy  because  it  may  cause  permanent 
damage to the foetus.  
If you are already pregnant, it is important to talk to your doctor before being given melphalan.  
You and your doctor will need to consider the risks and benefits of treatment with melphalan to you and 
your baby.  
You must take adequate contraceptive precautions to avoid pregnancy while you or your partner are 
having melphalan and during 6 months thereafter. 
Breast-feeding 
It  is  not  known  if  melphalan  passes  into  breast  milk.  Do  not  breast-feed  during  the  treatment  with 
PHELINUN. 
Fertility 
Melphalan can affect ovaries or sperm, which may cause infertility (inability to have a baby).  
In women, the ovulation, and as a consequence the menstruation, can stop (amenorrhoea). In men, based 
on findings in animal studies, there may be an absence or low amount of viable sperm cells. Therefore, 
men are advised to have a consultation on sperm preservation before treatment. 
Male and female contraception  
It is recommended that men and female who are receiving melphalan must use effective contraceptive 
precautions during treatment and up to 6 months afterwards.  
Driving and using machines 
This medicine can cause nausea and vomiting, which may reduce your ability to drive or use 
machines. This medicine also contains alcohol, which is likely to affect children and adolescents (see 
below for further information). 
PHELINUN contains ethanol (alcohol)  
This medicine contains 0.4 g of alcohol (ethanol) in each solvent vial, which is equivalent to 42 mg/ml 
(0.42% w/v). The amount in solvent vial of this medicine is equivalent to 10 ml beer or 4 ml wine.  
Adults 
The amount of alcohol in this medicine is not likely to have an effect in adults.  
The amount of alcohol in this medicine may alter the effects of other medicines.

Propylene  glycol  in  this  medicine  can  have  the  same  effects  as  drinking  alcohol  and  increase  the 
likelihood of side effects. 
Use this medicine only if recommended by a doctor. Your doctor may carry out extra checks while you 
are using this medicine. 
PHELINUN contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per vial, that is to say essentially ‘sodium-
free’. 
3. 
How PHELINUN is given 
PHELINUN  will  always  be  given  to you  by a  healthcare professional  with experience in the  use  of 
cancer medicines or stem cell transplantation. 
Your doctor will calculate the dose of PHELINUN according to your body surface or weight and your 
disease and how well your kidneys are working.  
When PHELINUN is used as a treatment before blood stem cell transplantation, it is always given in 
combination with other medicines. 
Use in adults 
The  recommended  dose  range  is  between  100 and 200 mg/m2 body  surface  area.  The  dose  can  be 
divided equally over 2 or 3 consecutive days.  
Use in paediatric population 
The dose regimen is as follows: one dose between 100 and 240 mg/m2 body surface area. The dose can 
be divided equally over 2 or 3 consecutive days.  
Use in patients with decreased kidney functioning  
The dose is usually lower depending on the severity of the kidney problem. 
Administration  
PHELINUN will be given by infusion (drip) into your vein.  
If PHELINUN is accidentally infused outside the vein and into the surrounding tissue or leaks from the 
vein into the surrounding tissue, the administration of PHELINUN should be interrupted immediately 
because it can cause severe tissue damage. This usually results in pain such as stinging and burning. If 
the patients cannot express that they experience pain, it should be observed if other signs such as redness 
and swelling of the injection site occur.  
If you are given more PHELINUN than you should 
If you think you have been given too much or have missed a dose, tell your doctor or nurse. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
PHELINUN 50 mg powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion 
As with all high dose chemotherapy, the preparation and handling of this product requires a number of 
precautions to ensure the protection of both healthcare professionals and their environment, taking into 
account the safety conditions required for the patient. 
In addition to the usual precautions to preserve the sterility of injectable preparations, it is necessary to: 
•  put on a long-sleeved clothes and tight cuffs to prevent any splashing of the solution on the skin;  
•  wear a disposable surgical mask and safely goggles; 
•  put on disposable gloves after aseptic hands washing; 
•  prepare the solution into a dedicated area; 
• 
•  dispose the materials used for the preparation of the solution (syringes, compresses, fields, vial) 
interrupt the infusion in case of extravation; 
in containers reserved for this purpose; 
•  destroy contaminated waste; 
38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  handle excreta and vomit with precaution.  
If PHELINUN accidentally contacts the skin, this must be immediately washed thoroughly with soap 
and water.  
In case of accidental contact with the eyes or mucous membranes, rinse abundantly with water. 
Inhalation of the product should be avoided.  
Pregnant women should avoid handling cytotoxic medicinal products.  
Thromboembolic complications 
Thrombosis prophylaxis needs to be administered during at least the first 5 months of the treatment, in 
particular  to  patients  who  are  more  at  risk  of  thrombosis.  The  decision  to  take  antithrombotic 
prophylactic measures  needs  to  be taken after  a thorough  assessment  of  the  underlying  risks  for the 
individual patient (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Should  thromboembolic  complications  occur  for  the  patient,  treatment  needs  to  be  stopped  and  the 
standard  anticoagulant  therapy  needs  to  be  started.  As  soon  as  the  patient  is  stabilised  by  the 
anticoagulant  therapy  and  the  complications  of  the  thromboembolic  incident  are  under  control, 
melphalan can be used in combination with lenalidomide and prednisone, or thalidomide and prednisone 
or dexamethasone can be resumed in the original dose contingent on the assessment of the risks and 
benefits. The patient needs to continue the anticoagulant therapy during the melphalan treatment. 
Posology 
Adults 
Multiple myeloma, malignant lymphoma (Hodgkin, non-Hodgkin lymphoma), acute lymphoblastic and 
myeloblastic leukaemia (ALL and AML), ovarian cancer and mammary adenocarcinoma  at a high-dose 
The  dose  regimen  is  as  follows:  one  dose  between  100  and  200 mg/m2  body  surface  area 
(approximatively  2.5  to  5.0 mg/kg  body  weight).  The  dose  can  be  divided  equally  over  2  or  3 
consecutive days. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is required following doses above 
140 mg/m2 body surface area.  
Malignant haematological diseases before allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
The  recommended  dose  is  140 mg/m2  as  a  single  daily  infusion  or  70 mg/m2  once  daily  for  two 
consecutive days. 
Paediatric population 
Acute lymphoblastic and myeloblastic leukaemia at high-dose 
The  dose  regimen  is  as  follows:  one  dose  between  100  and  200 mg/m2  body  surface  area 
(approximatively  2.5  to  5.0 mg/kg  body  weight).  The  dose  can  be  divided  equally  over  2  or  3 
consecutive days. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is required following doses above 
of 140 mg/m2 body surface area.  
Childhood neuroblastoma 
The recommended dose to consolidate a response obtained with a conventional treatment is one single 
dose  between  100 mg/m2  and  240  mg/m2  body  surface  area  (sometimes  divided  equally  over  3 
consecutive days) together with autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The infusion is 
used either alone or in combination with radiotherapy and/or other cytotoxic medicinal products.  
Haematological diseases before allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
The recommended dose is as follows:  
-  malignant haematological diseases: 140 mg/m2 as a single daily infusion; 
-  non-malignant haematological diseases: 140 mg/m2 as a single daily infusion or 70 mg/m2 once 
daily for two consecutive days. 
Special populations 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Elderly 
There is no dose recommendation for the administration of PHELINUN to elderly. 
However, frequent conventional doses of melphalan are applied in the elderly. 
Experience  in  the  use  of  high  dose  melphalan  in  elderly  patients  is  limited.  Consideration  should 
therefore be given to ensure adequate performance status and organ function, before using high dose 
melphalan in elderly patients. 
Renal impairment 
The posology should be adjusted in patients with renal impairment (see section 4.4). 
The clearance of melphalan, although variable, may be reduced with impaired renal function. 
High-dose melphalan with haematopoietic stem cell rescue has been used successfully even in dialysis 
dependent patients with end-stage renal failure. 
For  high  intravenous  doses  of  melphalan  (100  to  240 mg/m2  body  surface  area),  the  need  for  dose 
reduction  depends  upon  the  degree  of  renal  impairment,  whether  haematopoietic  stem  cells  are 
re-infused, and the therapeutic need. Melphalan injection should not be given without haematopoietic 
stem cell rescue at doses above 140 mg/m2. 
Preparation of PHELINUN solution 
Do not use this medicine if you notice visible signs of deterioration. 
PHELINUN should be prepared at a temperature below 25°C, by reconstituting the freeze-dried powder 
with 10 ml solvent and immediately shaking vigorously until a clear solution, without visible particles, is 
obtained. Only clear solutions free from particles should be used. 
Unless the concentrate is administered into the port of a fast-running infusion solution via injection port, 
the reconstituted solution must be further diluted prior to administration with an appropriate volume of 
sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection in order to obtain a final concentration between 
0.45 and 4.0 mg/ml. 
PHELINUN concentrate and solution have limited stability and should be prepared immediately before 
use. The maximum time between reconstitution and dilution in sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution 
for injection and the end of the infusion is 1 hour 30 minutes.  
PHELINUN is not compatible with infusion solutions containing glucose. 
Only sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection is recommended to be used. 
Should  any  visible  turbidity  or  crystallisation  appear  in  the  reconstituted  or  diluted  solutions,  the 
preparation must be discarded. 
Method of administration  
PHELINUN is for intravenous use only.  
Risk of extravasation could be observed when PHELINUN is administered via peripheral intravenous 
route.  In  case  of  extravasation,  the  administration  should  be  interrupted  immediately  and  a  central 
venous line route should be used. 
It is recommended that PHELINUN as concentrate (5 mg/ml) is injected slowly into the port of a fast-
running infusion solution.  
If high-dose PHELINUN is administered with or without transplantation, the administration as dilution 
via  a  central  venous  line  is  recommended  to  avoid  extravasation.  If  the  injection  of  the  concentrate 
(5 mg/ml)  slowly  into  a  fast-running  infusion  solution  is  not  appropriate,  PHELINUN  may  be 
administered  further  diluted  with  sodium  chloride  9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution  for  injection  in  a  “slow-
running” solution in an infusion bag.  
When  further  diluted  in  an  infusion  solution,  PHELINUN  has  reduced  stability  and  the  rate  of 
degradation increases rapidly with rise in temperature. 
It is recommended to let the infusion run at a temperature below 25°C.

1.  What PHELINUN is and what it is used for 
PHELINUN  contains  the  active  substance  called  melphalan  which  belongs  to  a  group  of  medicines 
called cytotoxics (also called chemotherapy) and it works by reducing the number of certain cells.  
PHELINUN can be used, alone or in combination with other medicines or with total body irradiation 
for the treatment of:  
•  different types of bone marrow cancer: multiple myeloma, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (also 
called acute lymphocytic leukaemia ALL) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)  
•  malignant  lymphoma  (Hodgkin  lymphoma  and  non-Hodgkin  lymphoma)  -  cancer  that  affects 
some types of white blood cells called lymphocytes cells that fight against infections) 
•  neuroblastoma, a type of cancer that grows from abnormal nerve cells in the body  
•  advanced cancer of the ovaries 
•  advanced breast cancer  
PHELINUN  is  also  used,  in  combination  with  other  cytotoxic  medicines,  as  a  preparation  medicine 
before blood stem cell transplantation to treat cancer of the blood in adults and cancer and non-cancerous 
disorders of the blood in the paediatric population. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given PHELINUN 
If you have any doubts, do not hesitate to ask your doctor for advice. 
You must not be given PHELINUN 
- 
- 
if you are allergic to melphalan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6) 
if you are pregnant (only with respect to the treatment prior to blood stem cell transplantation) 
or breast-feeding. 
Warnings and precautions  
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you are going to be treated with melphalan careful monitoring of the blood will be performed as this 
medicine is a potent cytotoxic that results in profound decrease of blood cells. 
Before treatment with melphalan, tell your doctor if any of the following apply to you:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
if you have had recent radiotherapy or cancer medicines because they frequently decrease the 
number of blood cell levels; 
if you have signs of an infection (fever, chills, etc.). In case of treatment with melphalan, your 
doctor  may  prescribe  medicines  such  as  antibiotics,  antifungals  or  antivirals  to  prevent 
infections. Your doctor may also consider giving you blood products (for example, red blood 
cells and platelets); 
if you are going to have a vaccination or were recently vaccinated. This is because some live 
attenuated vaccines (like polio, measles, mumps and rubella) may give you an infection while 
you are being treated with melphalan; 
if you have kidney problems or kidney failure (your kidneys don’t work well enough). In this 
case the dose of PHELINUN must be reduced; 
if you ever had a blood clot in your vein (thrombosis). The use of melphalan in combination 
with lenalidomide and prednisone or thalidomide or dexamethasone may increase the risk of 
development of blood clots. Your doctor can decide to give you medication to prevent the latter 
from happening. 
Adequate  hydration  and  forced  diuresis  (large  volume  of  fluids  given  in  the  vein  by  a  drip)  is 
recommeded when you are given melphalan. 
Children and adolescents  
Children  and  adolescents  may  be  more  likely  to  develop  serious  breathing  and  gastrointestinal 
complications. Tell your doctor or nurse at once if any breathing or gastrointestinal disturbances occur. 
Melphalan  should  not  be  used  as  a  preparation  medicine  before  blood  stem  cell  transplantation,  in 
adolescents over the age of 12 years with acute myeloid leukaemia. 
Safety  and  efficacy  of  the  use  of  melphalan  as  a  preparation  medicine  before  blood  stem  cell 
transplantation  in  children  less  than  2 years  for  the  treatment  of  acute  myeloid  leukaemia  and  acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia has not been established. 
Other medicines and PHELINUN 
Tell  your  doctor  or  nurse  if  you  are  taking  or  have  recently  taken  any  other  medicines  including 
medicines obtained without a prescription. 
In particular, tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any of the following: 
•  other cytotoxic medicines (chemotherapy) 
•  vaccination or you have been recently vaccinated (see warnings and precautions) because of 
possible general illness which may lead to a fatal outcome  
•  nalidixic acid (an antibiotic used to treat urinary tract infections). It can cause haemorrhagic 
enterocolitis with fatal outcome in children when given in combination with melphalan 
•  busulfan  (used  to  treat  a  certain  type  of  cancer).  In  children,  it  has  been  reported  that  the 
administration of melphalan less than 24 hours after the last oral busulfan administration may 
influence the development of toxicities. 
Cases of impaired renal function have been reported when cyclosporin is used to prevent graft-versus-
host disease after blood stem cell transplantion.  
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility  
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask your 
doctor for advice before you receive this medicine. 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy 
Blood  stem  cell  transplantation  is  contraindicated  in  pregnant  woman.  For  the  other  indications, 
treatment  with  melphalan  is  not  recommended  during  pregnancy  because  it  may  cause  permanent 
damage to the foetus.  
If you are already pregnant, it is important to talk to your doctor before being given melphalan.  
You and your doctor will need to consider the risks and benefits of treatment with melphalan to you and 
your baby.  
You must take adequate contraceptive precautions to avoid pregnancy while you or your partner are 
having melphalan and during 6 months thereafter. 
Breast-feeding 
It  is  not  known  if  melphalan  passes  into  breast  milk.  Do  not  breast-feed  during  the  treatment  with 
PHELINUN. 
Fertility 
Melphalan can affect ovaries or sperm, which may cause infertility (inability to have a baby).  
In women, the ovulation, and as a consequence the menstruation, can stop (amenorrhoea). In men, based 
on findings in animal studies, there may be an absence or low amount of viable sperm cells. Therefore, 
men are advised to have a consultation on sperm preservation before treatment. 
Male and female contraception  
It is recommended that men and female who are receiving melphalan must use effective contraceptive 
precautions during treatment and up to 6 months afterwards.  
Driving and using machines 
This medicine can cause nausea and vomiting, which may reduce your ability to drive or use machines. 
This medicine also contains alcohol, which is likely to affect children and adolescents (see below for 
further information). 
PHELINUN contains ethanol (alcohol)  
This medicine contains 1.6 g of alcohol (ethanol) in each solvent vial which is equivalent to 42 mg/ml 
(0.42 % w/v). The amount in solvent vial of this medicine is equivalent to 40 ml beer or 17 ml wine.

3. 
How PHELINUN is given 
PHELINUN  will  always  be  given  to you  by a  healthcare professional  with experience in the  use  of 
cancer medicines or stem cell transplantation. 
Your doctor will calculate the dose of PHELINUN according to your body surface or weight and your 
disease and how well your kidneys are working.  
When PHELINUN is used as a treatment before blood stem cell transplantation, it is always given in 
combination with other medicines. 
Use in adults 
The  recommended  dose  range  is  between  100 and 200 mg/m2 body  surface  area.  The  dose  can  be 
divided equally over 2 or 3 consecutive days.  
Use in paediatric population 
The dose regimen is as follows: one dose between 100 and 240 mg/m2 body surface area. The dose can 
be divided equally over 2 or 3 consecutive days.  
Use in patients with decreased kidney functioning  
The dose is usually lower depending on the severity of the kidney problem. 
Administration  
PHELINUN will be given by infusion (drip) into your vein.  
If PHELINUN is accidentally infused outside the vein and into the surrounding tissue or leaks from the 
vein into the surrounding tissue, the administration of PHELINUN should be interrupted immediately 
because it can cause severe tissue damage. This usually results in pain such as stinging and burning. If 
the patients cannot express that they experience pain, it should be observed if other signs such as redness 
and swelling of the injection site occur.  
If you are given more PHELINUN than you should 
If you think you have been given too much or have missed a dose, tell your doctor or nurse. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist or nurse.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
PHELINUN 200 mg powder and solvent for concentrate for solution for infusion 
As with all high dose chemotherapy, the preparation and handling of this product requires a number of 
precautions to ensure the protection of both healthcare professionals and their environment, taking into 
account the safety conditions required for the patient. 
In addition to the usual precautions to preserve the sterility of injectable preparations, it is necessary to: 
•  put on a long-sleeved clothes and tight cuffs to prevent any splashing of the solution on the skin;  
•  wear a disposable surgical mask and safely goggles; 
•  put on disposable gloves after aseptic hands washing; 
•  prepare the solution into a dedicated area; 
• 
•  dispose the materials used for the preparation of the solution (syringes, compresses, fields, vial) 
interrupt the infusion in case of extravation; 
in containers reserved for this purpose; 
•  destroy contaminated waste; 
•  handle excreta and vomit with precaution.  
If PHELINUN accidentally contacts the skin, this must be immediately washed thoroughly with soap 
and water.  
48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In case of accidental contact with the eyes or mucous membranes, rinse abundantly with water. 
Inhalation of the product should be avoided. 
Pregnant women should avoid handling cytotoxic medicinal products.  
Thromboembolic complications 
Thrombosis prophylaxis needs to be administered during at least the first 5 months of the treatment, in 
particular  to  patients  who  are  more  at  risk  of  thrombosis.  The  decision  to  take  antithrombotic 
prophylactic measures  needs  to  be taken after  a thorough  assessment  of  the  underlying  risks  for the 
individual patient (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Should  thromboembolic  complications  occur  for  the  patient,  treatment  needs  to  be  stopped  and  the 
standard  anticoagulant  therapy  needs  to  be  started.  As  soon  as  the  patient  is  stabilised  by  the 
anticoagulant  therapy  and  the  complications  of  the  thromboembolic  incident  are  under  control, 
melphalan can be used in combination with lenalidomide and prednisone, or thalidomide and prednisone 
or dexamethasone can be resumed in the original dose contingent on the assessment of the risks and 
benefits. The patient needs to continue the anticoagulant therapy during the melphalan treatment. 
Posology 
Adults 
Multiple myeloma, malignant lymphoma (Hodgkin, non-Hodgkin lymphoma), acute lymphoblastic and 
myeloblastic leukaemia (ALL and AML), ovarian cancer and mammary adenocarcinoma  at a high-dose 
The  dose  regimen  is  as  follows:  one  dose  between  100  and  200 mg/m2  body  surface  area 
(approximatively  2.5  to  5.0 mg/kg  body  weight).  The  dose  can  be  divided  equally  over  2  or  3 
consecutive days. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is required following doses above 
140 mg/m2 body surface area.  
Malignant haematological diseases before allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
The  recommended  dose  is  140 mg/m2  as  a  single  daily  infusion  or  70 mg/m2  once  daily  for  two 
consecutive days. 
Paediatric population 
Acute lymphoblastic and myeloblastic leukaemia at high-dose 
The  dose  regimen  is  as  follows:  one  dose  between  100  and  200 mg/m2  body  surface  area 
(approximatively  2.5  to  5.0 mg/kg  body  weight).  The  dose  can  be  divided  equally  over  2  or  3 
consecutive days. Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is required following doses above 
of 140 mg/m2 body surface area.  
Childhood neuroblastoma 
The recommended dose to consolidate a response obtained with a conventional treatment is one single 
dose  between  100 mg/m2  and  240  mg/m2  body  surface  area  (sometimes  divided  equally  over  3 
consecutive days) together with autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The infusion is 
used either alone or in combination with radiotherapy and/or other cytotoxic medicinal products.  
Haematological diseases before allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
The recommended dose is as follows:  
-  malignant haematological diseases: 140 mg/m2 as a single daily infusion; 
-  non-malignant haematological diseases: 140 mg/m2 as a single daily infusion or 70 mg/m2 once 
daily for two consecutive days. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
There is no dose recommendation for the administration of PHELINUN to elderly. 
However, frequent conventional doses of melphalan are applied in the elderly. 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Experience  in  the  use  of  high  dose  melphalan  in  elderly  patients  is  limited.  Consideration  should 
therefore be given to ensure adequate performance status and organ function, before using high dose 
melphalan in elderly patients. 
Renal impairment 
The posology should be adjusted in patients with renal impairment (see section 4.4). 
The clearance of melphalan, although variable, may be reduced with impaired renal function. 
High-dose melphalan with haematopoietic stem cell rescue has been used successfully even in dialysis 
dependent patients with end-stage renal failure. 
For  high  intravenous  doses  of  melphalan  (100  to  240 mg/m2  body  surface  area),  the  need  for  dose 
reduction  depends  upon  the  degree  of  renal  impairment,  whether  haematopoietic  stem  cells  are 
re-infused, and the therapeutic need. Melphalan injection should not be given without haematopoietic 
stem cell rescue at doses above 140 mg/m2. 
Preparation of PHELINUN solution 
Do not use this medicine if you notice visible signs of deterioration. 
PHELINUN should be prepared at a temperature below 25°C, by reconstituting the freeze-dried powder 
with 40 ml solvent and immediately shaking vigorously until a clear solution, without visible particles, is 
obtained. Only clear solutions free from particles should be used. 
Unless the concentrate is administered into the port of a fast-running infusion solution via injection port, 
the reconstituted solution must be further diluted prior to administration with an appropriate volume of 
sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection in order to obtain a final concentration between 
0.45 and 4.0 mg/ml. 
PHELINUN concentrate and solution have limited stability and should be prepared immediately before 
use. The maximum time between reconstitution and dilution in sodium chloride 9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution 
for injection and the end of the infusion is 1 hour 30 minutes.  
PHELINUN is not compatible with infusion solutions containing glucose.  
Only sodium chloride 9  mg/ml (0.9%) solution for injection is recommended to be used. 
Should  any  visible  turbidity  or  crystallisation  appear  in  the  reconstituted  or  diluted  solutions,  the 
preparation must be discarded. 
Method of administration  
PHELINUN is for intravenous use only.  
Risk of extravasation could be observed when PHELINUN is administered via peripheral intravenous 
route.  In  case  of  extravasation,  the  administration  should  be  interrupted  immediately  and  a  central 
venous line route should be used. 
It is recommended that PHELINUN as concentrate (5 mg/ml) is injected slowly into the port of a fast-
running infusion solution.  
If high-dose PHELINUN is administered with or without transplantation, the administration as dilution 
via  a  central  venous  line  is  recommended  to  avoid  extravasation.  If  the  injection  of  the  concentrate 
(5 mg/ml)  slowly  into  a  fast-running  infusion  solution  is  not  appropriate,  PHELINUN  may  be 
administered  further  diluted  with  sodium  chloride  9 mg/ml (0.9%) solution  for  injection  in  a  “slow-
running” solution in an infusion bag. 
When  further  diluted  in  an  infusion  solution,  PHELINUN  has  reduced  stability  and  the  rate  of 
degradation increases rapidly with rise in temperature. 
It is recommended to let the infusion run at a temperature below 25°C. 
Disposal 
Any solution unused after 1.5 hours should be discarded according to standard guidelines for handling 
and disposal of cytotoxic medicinal products. 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Any  unused  medicinal  product  or  waste  material  should  be  disposed  of  in  accordance  with  local 
requirements for cytotoxic medicinal products.

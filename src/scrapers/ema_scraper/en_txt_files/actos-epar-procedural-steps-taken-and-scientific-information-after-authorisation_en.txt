C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered

investigate a potential association between pioglitazone use 
and prostate cancer, using the CPRD GOLD database. The 
study was specifically designed to evaluate the risk of 
prostate cancer with use of pioglitazone in male patients 
with T2DM.Additionally, data on the incidence of 
adjudicated prostate cancer in patients receiving 
pioglitazone in the long-term Insulin Resistance 
Intervention after Stroke (IRIS) trial (IRIS Report) have 
also been provided. 
The results of this study did not show a statistically 
significant association between pioglitazone and prostate 
cancer. The MAH provided available histological data on 
cases of prostate cancer. Though the available data is very 
limited, the results of the histological data from all sources 
available to the MAH (Safety database, Pioglitazone_5018, 
PROactive Extension study and IRIS study) suggest that 
the majority of prostate cancers are prostatic 
adenocarcinomas in keeping with the common histological 
type seen in prostate cancer. Though the available data is 
very limited, there remain uncertainties in relation to any 
causal association between prostate cancer and 
pioglitazone therapy. The Marketing Authorisation Holder

Update of section 5.3 of the SPC upon request by

reflect the results of the mechanistic study in rats 
that was undertaken to investigate the mechanisms 
responsible for an increased incidence of hyperplasia 
and tumours of the urinary bladder epithelium in rats 
treated with pioglitazone for up to 2 years. In 
addition, the MAH table the opportunity to implement 
some minor changes in the labelling in line with the 
latest QRD template. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Labelling 
Labelling 
regulatory authorities, 2 year bioassays in the rat and 
mouse determined pioglitazone treatment to be associated 
with urinary bladder tumours in the male rat. Pioglitazone 
and its major metabolites were not genotoxic, as 
established in a comprehensive battery of genotoxicity 
assays. Through re-examination of retained bladder 
specimens in fixative, calculi were found in the bladder and 
it was hypothesized that urinary calculi formation with 
subsequent irritation, hyperplasia and metaplasia may be 
responsible for the carcinogenic responses observed in 
male rats. It was concluded that the administration of 
pioglitazone may be directly responsible for an increased 
incidence of hyperplastic changes in the bladder of the rat.  
Page 15/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The presence of microcrystals exacerbates the hyperplastic 
response but is not considered to be the cause of the 
hyperplastic changes. 
Updated part of Section 5.3 of the Summary of Product 
Characteristic: 
Pioglitazone was devoid of genotoxic potential in a 
comprehensive battery of in vivo and in vitro genotoxicity 
assays. An increased incidence of hyperplasia (males and 
females) and tumours (males) of the urinary bladder 
epithelium was apparent in rats treated with pioglitazone 
for up to 2 years.  
The formation and presence of urinary calculi with 
subsequent irritation and hyperplasia was postulated as the 
mechanistic basis for the observed tumourigenic response 
in the male rat. A 24-month mechanistic study in male rats 
demonstrated that administration of pioglitazone resulted 
in an increased incidence of hyperplastic changes in the 
bladder. Dietary acidification significantly decreased but did 
not abolish the incidence of tumours. The presence of 
microcrystals, although exacerbating the hyperplastic 
response is not considered to be the primary cause of the 
hyperplastic changes. The relevance to humans of the 
tumourigenic findings in the male rat cannot be excluded.  
There was no tumorigeni

incidence of fractures among female patients with type 2 
diabetes taking a TZD, the CHMP was of the view that this 
issue should be further investigated and requested the 
Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) to provide 
information on all cases of fractures in patients taking 
pioglitazone, as well as an overview of all clinical and non-
clinical studies with glitazones in which bone metabolism 
was investigated or in which an effect on bone has been

reported. 
Upon evaluation of the data provided by the MAH, the 
CHMP was of the view that there are theoretical reasons 
why thiazolidinediones could be associated with increased 
risk of fracture. Severity and duration of diabetes are risks 
factors for osteoporosis, and it is difficult to draw 
conclusions from the post-marketing data as fractures not 
surprisingly occur in older female patients. However, 
considering the clinical trial database, there appears to be a 
small but definite increased risk of fracture in the female 
patients treated with pioglitazone and analyses of the 
pooled data from controlled, double-blind, randomised, 
comparative clinical studies suggest a relative increase in 
fracture risk with time. 
Based on the available data, the CHMP requested the MAH 
to update the product information for Actos to reflect the 
risk of bone fractures. Sections "Special warnings and 
precautions for use" and "Undesirable effects" of the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) were updated 
with the available data from clinical trials regarding bone 
fractures and with a warning reflecting that the risk of 
fractures should be considered in the long-term care of 
women treated with pioglitazone.  
The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly.

Extension of Indication 
MAH committed to perform a large macrovascular outcome 
study of pioglitazone in patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus. The MAH submitted the results of this 
macrovascular outcome study (PROactive study). 
The PROactive study failed regarding it's pre-specified 
primary endpoint, and any benefit suggested by the 
secondary endpoint suggests an effect in a type 2 diabetic 
population with extensive disease and being treated 
concurrently with multiple anti-diabetic and cardiovascular 
medicines, and treated with 45mg of pioglitazone. As would 
be expected, there were increases in weight in the 
pioglitazone group, and an increase in hypoglycaemia 
corresponding with better control of diabetes. There was 
also an increase in cardiac failure in the pioglitazone group. 
Although these were no new safety issues, the previous 
safety concerns relating to weigh gain, oedema and heart 
failure were confirmed. 
Although the PROactive study suggested that 
administration of pioglitazone was not associated with an 
increased cardiovascular risk, the study failed to document 
a clear benefit, and the safety concerns mentioned above 
remain, particularly in the context of the new indication of 
pioglitazone in combination with insulin.

interactions with gemfibrozil and with rifampicin based on 
the publication of 3 drug-interactions studies describing the 
effect of CYP2C8 inhibition or induction on the 
pharmacokinetics of pioglitazone in humans. 
Jaakola et al. study demonstrated that gemfibrozil 
decreased the AUC(0-48) of M-III and M-IV by 42% and 
45%, respectively. However, the total AUC(0-inf) values of 
these metabolites were not considered markedly reduced 
by gemfibrozil since elimination of these metabolites 
seemed to be considerably slower when administered with 
gemfibrozil. 
The Deng et al. study reported that no statistically 
significant changes were seen in the total AUC of M-III or 
M-IV after gemfibrozil pretreatment. Therefore, these 
metabolites do not seem to play a major role in this 
interaction between pioglitazone and gemfibrozil. 
In regards to Pioglitazone and Rifampicin interaction, 
Jaakkola, et al reported that rifampicin caused a decrease 
Page 20/26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in the plasma concentration of pioglitazone, probably by 
induction of CYP2C8. 
The Jaakkola publication showed that the potent CYP3A4 
inhibitor itraconazole did not affect pioglitazone 
pharmacokinetics. 
A review of the MAH's global pioglitazone safety database 
shows no evidence that these interactions have given rise 
to any safety concern to date. The assessment of 
postmarketing reports in the Takeda and FDA safety 
databases did not suggest any clinical implications from the 
pharmacokinetic information shown in the 3 publications. 
However, there is a potential for interaction and it is 
possible that potential cases have not been considered up 
to now. Therefore SPC sections have been updated to 
reflect it.

information provided by these reports is limited although 
many cases appear to be associated with peripheral 
oedema. Most of the reports are from the United States in 
patients with more advanced disease. Concomitant insulin 
was used in 14 of 29 of these cases with no information in 
6 cases. Pre-existing eye disease was noted in 18 cases 
with macular oedema in 6 cases, diabetic retinopathy in 
another 4 cases and no eye disease in one case. It is 
unclear whether or not there is a direct association between 
pioglitazone and macular oedema but prescribers should be 
alert to the possibility of macular oedema if patients report 
disturbances in visual acuity and appropriate 
ophthalmologic referral should be considered. The SPC 
(sections 4.4 and 4.8) and the Package Leaflet (sections 2 
and 4) has been updated to reflect this information.

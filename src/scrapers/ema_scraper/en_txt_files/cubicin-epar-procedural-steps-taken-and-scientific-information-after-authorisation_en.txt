As part of routine pharmacovigilance activities, the MAH 
to include two new terms, tubulointerstitial nephritis 
(TIN) and drug reaction with eosinophilia and 
systemic symptoms (DRESS) to the Special warnings 
and precautions of the SmPC. TIN has also been 
added to the Adverse events section, based on a 
review of the cumulative post-marketing cases 
associated with the use of daptomycin.  
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
In addition, QRD-related, spelling, formatting and 
spacing corrections were implemented. 
identified a potential signal for tubulointerstitial nephritis 
(TIN) based on a review of cumulative post-marketing 
data. The MAH’s global safety database and the 
EudraVigilance Data Analysis System (EVDAS) database 
were queried to identify all post-marketing reports with a 
MedDRA preferred term (PT) of tubulointerstitial nephritis, 
allergic nephritis, nephritis, and drug reaction with 
eosinophilia and systemic symptoms from IBD (12-SEP-
2003) to 11-SEP-2019.  
A search for the PT of ‘drug reaction with eosinophilia and 
systemic symptoms’ (DRESS) was also performed. All 
published clinical literature about daptomycin and DRESS

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
and/or TIN was reviewed for consistency.  
The conclusion from the review was that there was 
sufficient evidence to suggest a plausible causal association 
of TIN to daptomycin exposure. In addition, the published 
cases of DRESS with end organ dysfunction, including renal 
impairment, were supportive of a plausible causal 
association to daptomycin exposure. Therefore, the findings 
in the MAH’s safety database and the review of literature 
support the changes to the product information. SmPC 
sections 4.4 and 4.8 and PL sections 2 and 4 were 
amended to include text to warn prescribers and patients 
on TIN and DRESS when using Cubicin.

Product Characteristics.

range: 1 to 17 years old), established that higher doses are 
required in children (varying according to age groups), in 
order to produce exposures equivalent to that seen for 
efficacy in adults.  These trials led to the selection of a 
well-characterised, efficacious, dosing regimen for 
paediatric patients with cSSSIs.  Moreover, from these 
studies, as well as from data obtained in 81 paediatric 
patients included in a retrospective registry (with 
daptomycin for the treatment of a serious Gram-positive 
bacterial infection), no new adverse events of concern were 
identified and the safety data from these paediatric patients 
were consistent with the known safety profile of 
daptomycin. 
The overall benefit-risk balance of daptomycin for the 
treatment of cSSSI in the paediatric population (1-17 years 
of age) is favourable.

However, based on the cumulative review of the cases 
related to hypersensitivity reaction and Severe Cutaneous 
Adverse Reactions (SCARs) received during the PSUR 
reporting period (12 September 2009 – 11 September 
2010), angioedema and DRESS are added to SmPC.  
The MAH has also proposed to include ‘cough’ in SmPC 
Section 4.8 under SOC Respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders, with frequency category ‘unknown’. 
The rationale for this inclusion was based on the cumulative 
review by Cubist of all cases where cough was reported 
from launch (September 11, 2003) to May 19, 2011. 
Corresponding changes are made to the Package Leaflet.    
The benefit–risk balance of Cubicin 350mg/ 500mg powder 
for solution for injection or infusion remains unchanged.

Based on emerging spontaneous and literature reports of

eosinophilic pneumonia occurring in association with 
Cubicin, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) was 
asked in June 2010 to address this risk. The MAH provided 
a response in July 2010 which proposed inclusion of 
eosinophilic pneumonia in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SPC 
and corresponding sections of the PL. 
(SmPC) and Package Leaflet (PL). 
Update of SPC section 4.4 “Special warnings and 
precautions for use” and section 4.8 “Undesirable 
effects” to include eosinophilic pneumonia.  The PL 
has been amended accordingly.  In addition, the 
MAH updates the contact phone number for Poland 
and updates Annex II due to recent DDPS changes.

States. Daptomycin has been used by physicians in the US 
to treat enterococcal bloodstream infections including 
endocarditis, particularly in the setting of vancomycin 
resistant enterococci. 
Treatment of enterococcal infections, including those 
associated with bacteraemia, is not a licensed indication for 
Cubicin in the EU since an appropriate dosage schedule for 
treating enterococcal infections, with or without 
bacteraemia, has not been identified. However, when faced 
with vancomycin-resistant enterococci and/or patients with 
few treatment options for their enterococcal infections for 
various reasons it seems inevitable that physicians in the 
EU could consider "off-label" use of daptomycin. Therefore, 
the SPC was revised to strengthen the warnings and 
statements to make prescribers aware that failures with 
daptomycin in the treatment of enterococcal infections that 
were mostly accompanied by bacteraemia have been 
reported. Furthermore, in some instances treatment failure 
has been associated with the selection of organisms with 
reduced susceptibility or frank resistance to daptomycin.

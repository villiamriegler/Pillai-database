1.  Introduction 
On November 2015, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for pregabalin, in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The  MAH  stated  that  Study  A0081231  titled  “A  6-Month,  Open-Label  Safety  Trial  of  Pregabalin  in 
Adolescent  Patients  with  Fibromyalgia”  is  an  open-label  extension  study  of  the  double-blind 
randomized fibromyalgia parent Study A0081180 (hereafter referred to as the “parent study”). 
The document provides data regarding the safety and efficacy of pregabalin in adolescent patients (12 
years to 17 years old at time of enrolment in the parent study). No claims are attached to this study.  
Pregabalin (LYRICA) is an α2-δ ligand that binds with high affinity to this auxiliary subunit of voltage-
gated calcium channels in central nervous system tissues. Pregabalin has been developed clinically for 
neuropathic  pain,  fibromyalgia,  anxiety,  and  epilepsy.  It  is  approved  in  the  European  Union  (EU)  for 
the treatment of peripheral and central neuropathic pain in adults, as adjunctive therapy in adults with 
partial seizures with or without secondary generalization, and for the treatment of Generalised Anxiety 
Disorder in adults. Pregabalin is not approved for the treatment of fibromyalgia in the EU.  
In  the  United  States  (US),  LYRICA  is  approved  for  fibromyalgia,  neuropathic  pain  (associated  with 
diabetic peripheral neuropathy, spinal cord injury, or post herpetic neuralgia), and adjunctive therapy 
for adult patients with partial onset seizures. LYRICA is approved for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia 
in Japan. 
2.2.  Clinical aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The  MAH  submitted  a  final  report(s)  for  Study  A0081231  (hereafter  study  1231)  titled  “A  6-Month, 
Open-Label  Safety  Trial  of  Pregabalin  in  Adolescent  Patients  with  Fibromyalgia”  in  which  63  subjects 
were  enrolled  which  was  an  open-label  extension  study  of  the  double-blind  randomized  fibromyalgia 
parent Study A0081180 thereafter referred to as the “parent study”). Patients were 12 to 17 years old 
at  time  of  enrolment  in  the  parent  study.  The  last  subject’s  last  study  visit  (LSLV)  in  this  trial  was 
completed on 01 June 2015.  
Pregabalin is indicated in the EU only in adults for the treatment of peripheral and central neuropathic 
pain, as adjunctive therapy in adults with partial seizures with or without secondary generalisation, and 
for Generalised Anxiety Disorder. The indication fibromyalgia has been rejected in the past because the 
effect was only demonstrated in the US population but not in EU studies.

2.2.2.  Clinical study 
Description 
Study  1231  was  an  open-label  extension  study  of  the  double-blind  randomized  fibromyalgia  parent 
Study  A0081180,  thereafter  referred  to  as  the  “parent  study”.  Altogether  63  subjects  were  enrolled. 
They were 12 to 17 years old at the time of enrolment in the parent study. The last subject’s last study 
visit (LSLV) in this trial was completed on 01 June 2015.  
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The objective of this study was to further evaluate the safety of pregabalin in a flexible dose regimen.  
Study design 
After the termination visit and study drug taper in the parent study, subjects had an option of starting 
open-label  treatment  in  Study  1231.  The  study  consisted  of  3  phases:  dose  optimization  (3  weeks), 
flexible dose (21 weeks), and follow-up/taper (1 week). 
Study population /Sample size 
Eligible subjects in Study 1231 had to meet the inclusion criteria from the parent study (age 12 years 
to  17  years  old  at  time  of  enrolment  in  the  parent  study,  and  the  Yunus  and  Masi  criteria  for  
fibromyalgia),  received double-blind  study  drug  in  the  parent  study,  completed  the  study  and  wished 
to take open-label pregabalin. 
A  total  of  63  subjects  were  screened,  enrolled,  and  treated  with  pregabalin  in  this  study.  The  first 
subject was enrolled on 01 September 2010, and the LSLV was on 01 June 2015. The 63 subjects were 
recruited at 19 study centers: US (14 centers; 40 subjects), India (4 centers; 20 subjects), and Czech 
Republic (1 center; 3 subjects). Of the 63 subjects, 33 (52.4%) subjects had previously been treated 
in the parent study with pregabalin, and 30 (47.6%) subjects with placebo. 
Treatments 
Subjects  initiated  pregabalin  dosing  at  75  mg/day  and,  based  on  tolerability  and  response,  had  their 
dose optimized over 3-weeks with continuation of 75 mg/day or had their dose escalated to 150, 300, 
or 450 mg/day. At the end of the study, subjects tapered the pregabalin dose over a 1-week period. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint in this study was the Pain Numeric Rating Scale (pain NRS). 
Statistical Methods 
The  efficacy  analysis  set  included  all  subjects  who  had  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study  drug.  There 
was  no  specific,  predetermined  sample  size  and  the  number  of  subjects  enrolled  was  determined  by 
the  number  of  subjects  who  wanted  to  receive  open-label  pregabalin  after  participating  in  the  parent 
study. Data for all subjects treated in the study were combined and labelled as pregabalin. 
Pain  NRS  results  were  listed  and  summarized  by  treatment  using  descriptive  statistics:  n,  arithmetic 
mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, maximum and range.

No inferential or statistical testing was performed. The pain NRS is a 0 to 10 scale, with higher scores 
reflecting worse pain. 
The baseline for pain NRS summaries  was defined as the last score prior to pregabalin treatment, as 
follows: 
For subjects randomized to pregabalin in the parent study, the baseline was defined as the last 
• 
score prior to treatment in that study (Visit 2, randomization). 
For  subjects  randomized  to  placebo  in  the  parent  study,  the  baseline  was  defined  as  the  last 
• 
score prior to treatment in Study 1231 (Visit 1). 
Results 
Baseline data 
Baseline  data  are  presented  in  table  1. The  majority  of  subjects  (53  of  63) were  female.  All  but 2  of 
the female subjects (3.8%) had experienced menarche. Mean (range) age of all subjects was 14.8 (12 
to 17) years. The majority of subjects were White (55.6%) or Asian (31.7%). All 63 subjects had been 
experiencing  fibromyalgia  symptoms  for  a  mean  of  2.5  years  (range:  0.6  years  to  11.5  years)  and 
were  diagnosed  with  fibromyalgia  for  a  mean  of  0.8  years  (range:  0.3  years  to  3.9  years)  prior  to 
study start, based on the medical history data provided at the start of the parent study. All 63 subjects 
met the Yunus and Masi criteria at the start of the parent study.

Efficacy results 
Table  2  presents  improvement  in  pain  during  the  study.  A  mean  (SD)  pain  score  improvement  from 
baseline  of  2.1  (2.51)  points  was  observed  at  Week  3,  the  first  post-treatment  assessment.  Similar 
levels  of  pain  improvement  were  maintained  throughout  the  study.  Mean  (SD)  pain  score 
improvements were 1.8 (2.95) points at Week 8, and 2.1 points at Weeks 16, 24, and at last visit on 
study  (SD:  2.60,  2.56,  and  2.47,  respectively).  Pain  score  improvements  were  observed  and 
maintained regardless of whether subjects had previously received pregabalin or placebo in the parent 
study.

Safety results 
The safety analysis set consisted of all subjects who received at least 1 dose of study drug.  
There were no deaths in this study. 
AE: Table 3 presents Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAE) which were experienced by ≥5% of 
subjects. A total of 45 (71.4%) subjects experienced at least 1 TEAE; these were considered related to 
study  drug  in  29  (46.0%)  subjects.  The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  were  dizziness  and  fatigue, 
reported for 14 (22.2%) and 8 (12.7%) subjects, respectively.  
The  majority  of  TEAEs  were  mild  or  moderate  in  severity.  At  least  1  severe  TEAE  was  reported  for  6 
(9.5%)  subjects:  pneumonia,  migraine,  appendicitis,  mood  swings,  arthralgia,  joint  instability,  and 
disturbance  in  attention,  of  which  migraine,  mood  swings,  and  disturbance  in  attention  were 
considered to be related to the study drug 
SAE:  There  were  3  (4.8%)  subjects  who  had  serious  adverse  events  (SAEs)  during  the  study.  These 
resulted in hospitalization due to: migraine, appendicitis, and joint instability, all of which were severe 
events. The SAEs of appendicitis and joint instability were not considered related to the study drug and 
resolved.  The  SAE  of  severe  migraine  was  considered  related  to  the  study  drug  and  resolved  with 
sequelae; the sequela of the SAE was a moderate migraine not considered by the investigator to be an 
SAE. 
There were 2 (3.2%) subjects who had TEAEs leading to discontinuation of the study drug.

Dizziness,  fatigue  and  nausea  in  1  subject  were  considered  related  to  the  study  drug,  and  spinal 
stenosis  in  1  subject  was  considered  related  to  the  disease  process.  All  events  leading  to 
discontinuation resolved. 
There  were  no  AEs  related  to  suicidal  ideations  or  behaviour,  including  no  suicide  attempts  or 
completed  suicides.  Suicidality  assessments  (STS,  C-SSRS)  did  not  report  any  suicidal  behaviour. 
During  the  study,  6  (9.5%)  subjects  reported  suicidal  ideation  without  plan  or  intent  on  the  STS 
questionnaire;  these  6  subjects  had  a  history  of  suicidal  ideation  on  the  STS  at  the  baseline  of  the 
parent study. 
Weight  gain  of  at  least  7%  was  reported  for  18  (29.0%)  subjects.  There  were  no  clinically  relevant 
findings in physical examination, neurological examination, vital signs, laboratory test results, Tanner 
staging, and ECG. There were no positive pregnancy test results or pregnancies during the study.

of Subjects – Safety Analysis Set 
2.2.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The adverse event (AE) profile observed in this study was consistent with the known safety profile for 
pregabalin as reported in the SPC.  
Pregabalin is not indicated for children and adolescents and the SPC indicates that safety and efficacy 
of  pregabalin  has  not  been  established  in  children  and  adolescents  and  that  therefore  no 
recommendation  on  a  posology  can  be  made.  The  SPC  also  indicates  that  pregabalin  safety  profile 
observed in two paediatric studies was similar to that observed in the adult studies.  
It  is  considered  that  although  some  of  the  safety  issues  observed  in  the  study,  specifically  mood 
swings  and  weight  gain,  may  have  different  implications  for  children  as  compared  to  adults,  since

pregabalin  is  not  indicated  for  the  paediatric  population,  the  new  evidence  does  not  change  the  B/R 
balance  of  pregabalin.  In  addition,  the  evidence  observed  in  this  study  is  already  reflected  in  the 
product information of pregabalin and therefore, no further actions are required in this respect. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
The  MAH  has  submitted  a  paediatric  safety  study  for  pregabalin  which  included  63  adolescents  with 
fibromyalgia. The results show no new safety issue and the MAH is not requesting any changes to the 
product information based on this study.  
Pregabalin is not indicated for children and adolescents and the SPC indicates that safety and efficacy 
of  pregabalin  has  not  been  established  in  children  and  adolescents  and  that  therefore  no 
recommendation  on  a  posology  can  be  made.  The  SPC  also  indicates  that  pregabalin  safety  profile

pregabalin  is  not  indicated  for  the  paediatric  population,  the  new  evidence  does  not  change  the  B/R 
balance  of  pregabalin.  In  addition,  the  evidence  observed  in  this  study  is  already  reflected  in  the 
product information of pregabalin and therefore, no further actions are required in this respect. 
  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required.

1.  Recommendation 
Based on the review of the data on quality, safety and efficacy, the  CHMP considers that the generic 
application for Tigecycline Accord Powder for solution for infusion 50mg/vial indicated in adults and in 
children from the age of eight years for the treatment of the following infections: 
  Complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI), excluding diabetic foot infections 
  Complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) 
Tigecycline should be used only in situations where other alternative antibiotics are not suitable. 
is not approvable, since a major objection has been identified, which precludes a recommendation 
for marketing authorisation at the present time.  
The major objection precluding a recommendation of marketing authorisation, pertains to the following 
principal deficiencies:  
GMP non-compliance for the active substance manufacturing site  has been identified by the European 
Medicines Agency Compliance and Inspection Service.   
Proposal for questions to be posed to additional experts 
N/A 
 
Proposal for inspection 
GMP inspection(s) 
Dossier provided in Module 3 is generally  in accordance  with the quality scientific guidelines, general 
Ph.Eur. requirements; therefore from the quality part there is no reason for the request for inspection 
action prior to authorisation.  
Inspections  of  the  drug  substance  manufacturing  sites  and  /or  the  drug  product  manufacturing  sites 
and  /or  the  batch  release  sites  are  not  considered  necessary  for  the  completion  of  the  module  3 
assessment,  however  GMP  non-compliance  for  the  active  substance  manufacturing  site  has  been 
identified. For that reason the procedure is not approvable at the moment.

50mg/vial.  The  reference  product  is  Tygacil  which  has  been  authorised  in  the  EU  since  April  2006 
through centralised procedure by Pfizer Limited, United Kingdom. 
This product is exempted from the bioequivalence study in accordance with Annex II to the Guideline 
on  the  investigation  of  bioequivalence,  CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev.1.  It  is  intended  to  be  used  for 
the same indication, in the same dosage regimen and route(s) of administration as Tygacil. 
This medicinal product is supplied in vials as a sterile lyophilized powder or cake containing 50 mg/vial 
of Tigecycline. 
Tigecycline is a member of tetracycline class of antibiotics that prevents bacterial growth by inhibiting 
the protein synthesis. The tetracycline antibiotics are active against a broad spectrum of bacteria. They 
have displayed an activity in vitro against the most common causative Gram-positive, Gram-negative 
and  anaerobic  pathogens.  In  addition,  tigecycline  has  demonstrated  activity  against  drug-resistant 
pathogens such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and 
organisms  producing  extended-spectrum  beta-lactamases  (such  as  Escherichia  coli  and  Klebsiella 
pneumoniae).   
Tigecycline,  a  glycylcycline  antibiotic,  inhibits  protein  translation  in  bacteria  by  binding  to  the  30S 
ribosomal  subunit  and  blocking  entry  of  amino-acyl  tRNA  molecules  into  the  A  site  of  the  ribosome.  
Tigecycline  is  a  part  of  the  third  generation  of  tetracyclines  which  has  modified  structure  for  dealing 
with the known resistance mechanisms of bacteria.   
Proposed indication 
Tigecycline Accord is indicated in adults and in children from the age of eight years for the treatment of 
the following infections: 
• 
• 
Complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI), excluding diabetic foot infections 
Complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) 
Tigecycline should be used only in situations where other alternative antibiotics are not suitable. 
Posology 
Adults 
The recommended dose for adults is an initial dose of 100 mg followed by 50 mg every 12 hours for 5 
to 14 days. 
The duration of therapy should be guided by the severity, site of the infection, and the patient’s clinical 
response. 
Hepatic impairment 
No dosage adjustment is warranted in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment (Child Pugh 
A and Child Pugh B). 
In  patients  (including  paediatrics)  with  severe  hepatic  impairment  (Child  Pugh  C),  the  dose  of 
Tigecycline Accord should be reduced by 50 %. Adult dose should be reduced to 25 mg every 12 hours 
following the 100 mg loading dose. Patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh C) should be 
treated with caution and monitored for treatment response

Renal impairment 
No  dosage  adjustment  is  necessary  in  patients  with  renal  impairment  or  in  patients  undergoing 
haemodialysis  
Elderly  
No dosage adjustment is necessary in elderly patients  
Paediatric population 
Tigecycline Accord is only to be used to treat patients aged 8 years and older after consultation with a 
physician with appropriate experience in the management of infectious diseases. 
Children aged 8 to <12 years: 1.2  mg/kg  of tigecycline every  12  hours intravenously to  a maximum 
dose of 50 mg every 12 hours for 5 to 14 days. 
Adolescents aged 12 to <18 years: 50 mg of tigecycline every 12 hours for 5 to 14 days. 
Children under 8 years of age: 
The safety and efficacy of Tygacil in children under 8 years of age have not been established. No data 
are  available.  Tygacil  should  not  be  used  in  children  aged  under  8  years  because  of  teeth 
discolouration. 
Method of administration: 
Tigecycline  Accord  is  administered  only  by  intravenous  infusion  over  30  to  60  minutes.  Tigecycline 
should be preferably administered over a 60-minute length of infusion in paediatric patients. 
2.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The CHMP Guidelines were followed. 
The applicant did not receive CHMP Scientific Advice pertinent to the clinical investigation. 
2.4.  General comments on compliance with GMP, GLP, GCP  
GMP 
Names, addresses and responsibility of each manufacturer are provided.  Some comments to the GMP 
certificates have been raised  from  inspection section.  For manufacturing sites within  the  Community, 
the  RMS  has  accepted  copies  of  current  manufacturer  authorisations  issued  by  inspection  services  of 
the competent authorities as certification that acceptable standards of GMP are in place at those sites; 
with minor concerns remaining. For manufacturing sites outside the Community, the RMS has accepted 
copies  of  current  GMP  Certificates  of  inspection  summary  reports,  ‘close-out  letters’  or  ‘exchange  of 
information’  issued  by  the  inspection  services  of  the  competent  authorities  (or  those  countries  with 
which  the  EEA  has  a  Mutual  Recognition  Agreement  for  their  own  territories)  as  certification  that 
acceptable  standards  of  GMP  are  in  place  at  those  non-Community  sites;  with  minor  concerns 
remaining. Regarding the statement on GMP for the active substance a declaration is provided from the 
manufacturer responsible for manufacture of the finished product and batch release situated in the EU, 
however the declaration is not acceptable.

Inspections  of  the  drug  substance  manufacturing  sites  and  /or  the  drug  product  manufacturing  sites 
and  /or  the  batch  release  sites  are  not  considered  necessary  for  the  completion  of  the  module  3 
assessments  however  GMP  non-compliance  for  the  active  substance  manufacturing  site  has  been 
identified.  Therefore in context of the Tigecycline Accord application the procedure is not approvable 
until this issue will be resolved.  
GCP 
Compliance with GLP and GCP is not applicable as no bioequivalence study is required for this 
application. 
2.5.  Type of application and other comments on the submitted dossier 
This  application  concerns  a  generic  centralized  procedure  and  is  submitted  in  accordance  with  Legal

3.1.4.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
Drug substance 
The  drug  substance  Tigecycline  is  not  listed  in  Ph.Eur.  The  manufacturer  holds  ASMF.  The 
manufacturer is GMP non-compliant and major objection is raised. 
Specification  and  tests  methods  fully  comply  Ph.  Eur.  monograph,  USP  monograph,  where  applicable 
general  chapter  and  In-house  methods.  Description  of  methods  along  with  their  validation  has  been 
provided.  The quality of drug substance is declared on the presented batch analysis.  
Drug product 
Tigecycline powder for solution for infusion, 50 mg/vial is an orange lyophilized powder or cake in clear 
glass  vial  with  flip-off  seal.  The  applicant  claims  essential  similarity,  under  article  10.1,  to  Tygacil, 
powder  for  solution  for  injection,  which  contains  the  same  amount  of  active  substance  in  the  same 
pharmaceutical  form.  This  reference  product  MA  No  EU/1/06/336/01  is  held  by  Pfizer  Limited,  UK, 
granted 24.4.2006 in the  European Union.  The essential similarity of the applicant’s  formulation  with 
reference formulation has been demonstrated by comparison of composition, impurity profile and other 
parameters. 
The development and manufacture of the  product  has been described, however  there  are  unresolved 
concerns remaining. 
All  the  excipients  are  conventional  pharmaceutical  ingredients  complying  with  the  requirements  of 
European Pharmacopoeia and USNF. The choice of excipients is justified and their functions explained.  
There  is  a  single  drug  product  manufacturer  and  other  manufacturing  sites  for  secondary  packaging, 
quality control and batch release.  
The  product  specifications  cover  appropriate  parameters  for  this  dosage  form.    However,  there  are 
some points to be clarified.  
Analytical  methods  are  sufficiently  described  and  validated.  CoAs  of  the  drug  product  have  been 
enclosed. The batch analysis results show that the finished product meets the proposed specification. 
At  this  moment  the  proposed  storage  conditions  and  shelf-life  cannot  be  accepted.  There  are  some 
points which need to be resolved before the marketing authorization is granted.  
3.2.  Non clinical aspects 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided. The 
non-clinical  aspects  of  the  SmPC  are  in  line  with  the  SmPC  of  the  reference  product.  The  active 
substance  of  Tigecycline  Accord  50  mg/vial,  powder  for  solution  for  infusion  is  not  considered  a  new 
active  substance.  Pharmacodynamic,  pharmacokinetic  and  toxicological  properties  of  tigecycline  are 
well  known.    As  tigecycline  is  a  widely  used,  well-known  active  substance,  no  further  studies  are 
required.    An  overview  based  on  literature  review  is,  thus  appropriate.  Nevertheless,  some 
shortcomings have been noted in the Non-clinical Overview.   
Assessment report  
EMA/531401/2017  
Page 10/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The non-clinical overview report refers to 23 publications. 
The non-clinical overview is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. It is agreed that no 
further non-clinical studies are required.  
However one outstanding issue needs to be clarified by the Applicant. 
3.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  was  submitted.  This  was  justified  by  the  applicant.  Since 
Tigecycline  Accord  is  intended  for  generic  substitution,  this  will  not  lead  to  an  increased  exposure  to 
the environment. An environmental risk assessment is therefore not deemed necessary. 
3.2.2.  Conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
Tigecycline Accord could be approvable from the non-clinical point of view once the outstanding issue 
will be addressed by the applicant. 
3.3.  Clinical aspects 
The applicant has provided a clinical overview where pharmacology, efficacy  and safety of tigecycline 
were discussed. The active substance of Tigecycline Accord 50 mg/vial, powder for solution for infusion 
(tigecycline)  is  not  considered  a  new  active  substance.  Pharmacodynamic,  pharmacokinetic,  efficacy 
and  safety  profiles  of  tigecycline  are  well  known.    As  tigecycline  is  a  widely  used,  well-known  active 
substance,  no  further  studies  are  required.    An  overview  based  on  literature  review  is,  thus, 
appropriate.  Information  stated  in  the  clinical  overview  is  up-to-date  and  adequately  supported  with 
the scientific literature. 
The  information  in  the  proposed  SmPC  has  been  generally  harmonised  with  the  currently  approved 
SmPC of the reference product Tygacil. However, some amendments are needed throughout the SmPC 
and Package leaflet to be fully in line with  the  reference  product.  Relevant for the  assessment  is the 
Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98).  
3.3.1.  Exemption 
As this is an abridged license application claiming essential similarity to a currently marketed product, 
no clinical studies have been undertaken to support the application. 
According  to  the  Guideline  on  the  Investigation  of  Bioequivalence  (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev 
1/Corr**), “bioequivalence studies are generally not required if the test product is to be administered 
as  an  aqueous  intravenous  solution  containing  the  same  active  substance  as  the  currently  approved 
product.  
The  applicant’s  product  Tigecycline  Accord  powder  for  solution  for  injection  has  the  same  active 
substance  in  the  same  concentration  (after  reconstitution)  as  the  reference  medicinal  product. 
Furthermore Tigecycline Accord has the same indications, pharmaceutical form, route of administration 
(intravenous infusion), and the same strength as Tygacil. 
According  to  the  Guideline  on  the  Investigation  of  Bioequivalence  (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev 
1/Corr**), the waiving of bioequivalence studies is therefore deemed acceptable. 
Assessment report

3.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No bioequivalence study was submitted to support the Marketing Authorisation Application and no such 
study is required according to Appendix II  to  the  Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence  as 
the test product is to be administrated as an aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active 
substance as the currently approved product.  
3.3.3.  Pharmacokinetic Conclusion   
Tigecycline Accord is considered to be essentially similar to Tygacil. 
3.3.4.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were provided and no such studies are required for this application 
3.3.5.  Additional data 
N/A 
3.3.6.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
3.3.7.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The  application  contains  an  adequate  review  of  published  clinical  data.  No  bioequivalence  study  is 
required for this application which is in line with the Appendix II to the Guideline on the Investigation 
of Bioequivalence.  
Tigecycline  Accord  is  considered  to  be  essentially  similar  to  the  reference  product  Tygacil  of  Pfizer 
Limited. 
3.3.8.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Tigecycline  Accord  is  considered  to  be  essentially  similar  to  the  reference  product  Tygacil  of  Pfizer 
Limited.  Approval  could  be  recommended  from  the  clinical  point  of  view,  provided  that  the  Applicant 
satisfactory addresses outstanding issues.

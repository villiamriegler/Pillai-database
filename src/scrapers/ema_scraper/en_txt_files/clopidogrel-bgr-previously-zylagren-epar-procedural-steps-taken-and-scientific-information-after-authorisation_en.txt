1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

The safety and efficacy of clopidogrel have been 
demonstrated by several large clinical studies. No literature 
review on the efficacy/effectiveness has been submitted by 
the MAH within this application. Since the clinical efficacy of 
clopidogrel in the approved indications is well established 
and evidence of clinical efficacy has been discussed at time 
of approval the CHMP finds acceptable the MAH approach of 
not performing a literature review on the 
efficacy/effectiveness of clopidogrel. 
The beneficial effect of Zylagren remains in line with that of 
the originator product (Plavix), and is considered positive. 
The CHMP therefore recommended that the Marketing 
Authorisation for Zylagren can be renewed with unlimited 
validity.

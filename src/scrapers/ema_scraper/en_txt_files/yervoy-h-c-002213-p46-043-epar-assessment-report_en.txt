1.  Introduction 
On 8 April  2021 the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for nivolumab and ipilimumab,  in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
Study CA209908 is part of the agreed nivolumab Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) covering the 
conditions of treatment of malignant neoplasms of lymphoid tissue and treatment of malignant 
neoplasms of the CNS (PIP number EMEA-001407-PIP02-15-M05; latest EMA Decision P/0237/2021, 
dated 14-Jun-2021).  
Study CA209908 is also part of the ipilimumab  Risk Management Plan (RMP) to report  long-term safety 
data in paediatric patients in studies of nivolumab and ipilimumab  combination therapy. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information  on the development  program 
The MAH stated that study CA209908 is a stand-alone study. 
At the time of study design and initiation for CA209908, nivolumab and nivolumab in combination with 
ipilimumab  were being investigated in adult patients with glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) in Studies 
CA209143, CA209498, and CA209548 (results not yet published) although no survival benefit has been 
observed.  
Neither nivolumab nor ipilimumab  are presently approved for adult or paediatric patients in 
malignancies of the CNS. Ipilimumab  is approved for paediatric use in the following indication: as 
monotherapy for the treatment of advanced (unresectable or metastatic) melanoma in adults, and 
adolescents 12 years of age and older. 
At the time of study design and initiation of CA209908, there was limited data available regarding the 
use of immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) in paediatric subjects, although preliminary phase 1/2 
studies had demonstrated acceptable safety and tolerability  of nivolumab and ipilimumab  in childhood 
malignancies other than CNS. The research hypothesis for Study CA209908, therefore, aimed to 
investigate whether treatment with nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab combined with ipilimumab 
would be safe and have clinical activity in paediatric subjects with primary  high grade CNS tumours, 
which are almost uniformly fatal, with limited therapeutic options, and pose a high unmet medical 
need. 
2.2.  Information  on the pharmaceutical  formulation  used in the study 
The selection of the monotherapy dose of 3 mg/kg nivolumab and combination dose of 3mg/kg 
nivolumab + 1 mg/kg ipilimumab  was primarily  justified by the benefit/risk profile obtained with these 
regimens in adult clinical studies. Nivolumab and ipilimumab  are both administered as intravenous 
infusion.  
2.3.  Clinical  aspects

•  Study CA209908: an open-label, sequential-arm, Phase 1b/2 clinical study of nivolumab 
monotherapy and nivolumab + ipilimumab  in paediatric subjects with high-grade primary 
central nervous system (CNS) malignancies. 
2.3.2.  Clinical  study 
Study CA209908: an open-label, sequential-arm, Phase 1b/2 clinical study of nivolumab monotherapy 
and nivolumab + ipilimumab  in paediatric subjects with high-grade primary central nervous system 
(CNS) malignancies. 
Description 
CA209908 is an open-label, sequential-arm, Phase 1b/2 clinical study of nivolumab monotherapy and 
nivolumab + ipilimumab  combination therapy in paediatric subjects with high-grade primary  CNS 
malignancies, including diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG), high-grade glioma (HGG), 
medulloblastoma, ependymoma, and uncommon malignant tumours (pineoblastoma, atypical 
teratoid/rhabdoid tumour [AT/RT], and embryonal CNS tumours). 
This study includes 5 cohorts (Cohorts 1-5) and 2 modules (Modules A and B) in each cohort.  
The study design is visualized in Figure 1. 
Cohorts are defined by tumour type (histology): 
•  Cohort 1: subjects with newly-diagnosed DIPG, including midline glioma with H3K27M 
mutation 
•  Cohort 2: subjects with recurrent or progressive non-brainstem HGG, regardless of mutation 
status, including glioblastoma 
•  Cohort 3: subjects with relapsed or resistant medulloblastoma  
•  Cohort 4: subjects with relapsed or resistant ependymoma 
•  Cohort 5: subjects with other recurrent or progressive subtypes of high-grade CNS malignancy 
(eg, pineoblastoma, AT/RT,  germ cell tumour, and others) 
Treatments are defined by Module: 
•  Module A: nivolumab monotherapy 
•  Module B: nivolumab + ipilimumab

The primary  CSR for CA209908
provides results from the pre-specified final analyses of the primary 
endpoints, secondary endpoints, and a subset of exploratory endpoints, at a database lock (DBL) of 
13-Jan-2021. 
Study CA209908 remains ongoing until completion of the follow-up phase for all subjects, including 
observations at least 100 days after the last dose for safety and a minimum of 3 years for survival; 
final analysis will be planned upon study completion. 
There were 4 subjects < 18 years old remaining on study treatment at the time of the DBL. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The primary  objectives of the study include the estimation of the safety and tolerability of study 
treatment in a safety lead-in phase across cohorts, overall survival (OS) in Cohort 1, and progression-
free survival (PFS) in Cohorts 2-5. 
Study design 
The study had an open-label, sequential arm design.  
CA209908 consisted of a safety lead-in phase and expansion phase. A safety lead-in phase across 
cohorts was implemented prior to the expansion phase, because nivolumab, as monotherapy or 
immediately after radiation therapy (RT) or in combination with ipilimumab,  had not been previously 
studied in paediatric subjects with CNS tumours.  
Enrolment to Module A (nivolumab monotherapy) opened in parallel  for all cohorts. The first 6 subjects 
in Cohort 1 treated and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT)-evaluable were to be evaluated for safety before 
additional subjects would be treated in that cohort. Separately,  the first 10 subjects treated and DLT-
evaluable in the recurrent disease Cohorts 2-5 were to be evaluated for safety before additional 
subjects would be treated in those cohorts. 
Based on determination of adequate safety, enrolment re-opened for evaluation of efficacy to complete 
the planned number of subjects for each cohort in Module A (nivolumab monotherapy) expansion. 
Subjects evaluated in the safety lead-in were included for evaluation of efficacy.

article 46 of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as am ended 
EMA/400368/2021

Enrolment began in Module B (nivolumab + ipilimumab),  by cohort, based on completion of planned 
accrual in Module A or a decision of the Study Steering Committee (SSC). For Module B, the first 
10 subjects treated and DLT-evaluable in all cohorts combined were to be evaluated for safety by the 
SCC before additional subjects would be enrolled, after which cohorts were to be re-opened for full 
accrual in the expansion. An individual participant was not permitted to enrol in more than one 
module.  
Study population /Sample size 
In the expansion phase of CA209908, the population for evaluation was overall, all-treated subjects 
for both safety and efficacy endpoints. Although not a pre-specified population for analysis in the 
CA209908 statistical analysis plan (SAP), selected key analyses were performed based on all-treated 
subjects < 18 years of age for the purposes of the current procedure, in order to present results 
specifically for paediatric subjects defined as < 18 years of age at the time of study enrolment.  
Treatments 
•  Nivolumab monotherapy (Module A): nivolumab 3 mg/kg as a 30-minute intravenous (IV) 
infusion on Day 1 of each treatment cycle Q2W, as monotherapy 
•  Nivolumab + ipilimumab (Module B): nivolumab 3 mg/kg as a 30-minute IV infusion, 
followed 30 minutes later by ipilimumab  1 mg/kg as a 30-minute IV infusion on Day 1 of each 
treatment cycle Q3W for 4 doses. Starting 3 weeks after the fourth dose of the combination, 
nivolumab was administered at a dose of 3 mg/kg as a 30-minute IV infusion on Day 1 of each 
treatment cycle Q2W, as monotherapy. 
For both modules, treatment was to begin within 3 calendar days of treatment assignment and 
subjects in Cohort 1 (newly diagnosed pontine glioma, post-radiotherapy) began treatment within 6 
weeks after the end of RT.  For both modules, treatment was to continue until progression, 
unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or end of study, whichever occurred first.

Statistical Methods 
Sample size 
Sample sizes for Cohorts 1-4 were calculated assuming exponential survival and the standard formula 
adapted for a single arm as described in Section 10.1 of the study protocol.  By applying this 
methodology, the intended target numbers of subjects for Cohorts 1-4 were obtained as follows: 
Cohort 1: N = 22 for each of the expansion Cohorts 1A and 1B. This assumes 80% power  with a one 
sided Type 1 error  of 10%, a historical median OS of 9 months, 1-year accrual, 2-year follow-up, and a 
target effect size of median OS of 15 months.  
Cohort 2: N = 15 for each of the expansion Cohorts 2A and 2B. This assumes 80% power  with a 
one-sided Type 1 error of 10%, a historical 6-months PFS rate of 18%, 1-year accrual, one-year 
follow-up, and a target 6-month PFS rate of 38%.

Cohort 3: N = 15 for each of the expansion Cohorts 3A and 3B. This assumes 80% power  with a 
one-sided Type 1 error of 10%, 1-year accrual and 1-year follow-up, a historical 4-month PFS rate of 
18% and a target 4-month PFS rate of 38%, equivalent to 6-month PFS rate of 23%.  
Cohort 4: N = 10 for each of the expansion Cohorts 4A and 4B. This assumes at least 80% power with 
a one-sided Type 1 error of 10%, a historical median PFS of 2.1 months, 1-year accrual, 1-year follow-
up, and a target median PFS of 4.4 months. 
Cohort 5: N = 18 for each of the expansion Cohorts A5 and B5. This was not based on statistical 
considerations as these cohorts contain various tumor types. However, if the disease control rate at 12 
months is 30%, 18 subjects provides 21% precision for the estimate. 
Primary efficacy analyses 
Results for OS and PFS were intended to be compared with the available historical controls (median OS 
of 9 months for DIPG, median PFS of 2.25 months for HGG, 4-month PFS rate of 18% for 
medulloblastoma, and median PFS of 2.1 months for ependymoma).  
The primary  efficacy analyses were performed on the all-treated population for the final analysis. 
Efficacy analysis of nivolumab monotherapy and nivolumab + ipilimumab  was performed for each 
cohort separately; however, treated subjects in the safety lead-in phase who met the inclusion criteria 
for the corresponding cohort were also included in the cohort efficacy analysis.  
Time to event distribution (ie, PFS, OS and duration of response [DOR]) were estimated using the 
Kaplan-Meier (KM) product limit method. Median time along with 95% (or 80%) confidence interval 
(CI) was constructed based on a log-log transformed CI for the survivor function S(t). Rates at fixed 
timepoints (eg, OS at 12 months) were derived from the KM estimate and corresponding CIs were 
derived based on Greenwood formula for variance derivation and on log-log transformation applied on 
the survivor function S(t). CIs for binomial proportions  (objective response rate [ORR]) were derived 
using the Clopper-Pearson method. 
Overall Survival (OS) 
•  Cohort 1 
The OS curve for each treatment group was estimated using the KM method. Median OS and the 
corresponding two-sided 80% CIs using the log-log transformation were computed. The distribution of 
OS for each treatment group was also compared against the historical control of an exponential 
distribution with median OS of 9 months, using a one-sided one-sample log rank test when 
approximately  17 events had occurred or after each subject had been followed for at least 24 months. 
At the time of DBL, all subjects were followed for at least 24 months for OS. As one of the secondary 
endpoints, OS rate at 12 months for each treatment group was estimated using KM estimates on the 
OS curve and its corresponding 95% CI was derived based on Greenwood formula. 
•  Cohorts 2-4 
As secondary endpoints for Cohorts 2-4, the OS curve for each treatment group was estimated using 
the KM method. Median OS and the corresponding two-sided 95% CIs using the log-log transformation 
were computed. OS rate at 12 month for each treatment group was estimated using KM estimates on 
the OS curve and its corresponding 95% CI was derived based on Greenwood formula.  
•  Cohort 5

OS (secondary endpoint) was listed. OS curves were computed using KM method for pooled indications 
and selected individual indications. The corresponding 95% CI for median OS was calculated via 
Brookmeyer  and Crowley methodology using log-log transformation. 
Progression Free Survival (PFS) 
•  Cohort 1  
As one of the secondary endpoints of Cohort 1, PFS for each treatment group was estimated by KM 
method and the corresponding 95% CI for median PFS were calculated via Brookmeyer and Crowley 
methodology using log-log transformation.  
•  Cohorts 2-4  
As the primary  efficacy endpoints of Cohorts 2 to 4, the PFS curve for each treatment group was 
estimated using the KM method. Median PFS and the corresponding two-sided 80% CIs using the log-
log transformation were computed.  
The distribution of PFS for Cohort 2 for each treatment group was compared against the historical 
control of an exponential distribution with median PFS of 2.25 months, using a one-sided one-sample 
log rank test when each subject had been followed for at least 12 months.  
The distribution of PFS for Cohort 3 for each treatment group was compared against the historical 
control of an exponential distribution with PFS at 4 months equal to 18%, using a one-sided 
one-sample log rank test when either 15 events had occurred or each subject had been followed for at 
least 12 months. 
The distribution of PFS for Cohort 4 for each treatment group was compared against the historical 
control of an exponential distribution with median PFS equal to 2.1 months, using a one-sided one-
sample log rank test when either 10 events have occurred or each subject has been followed for at 
least 12 months. 
In addition, as one of the secondary endpoints for Cohorts 2-4, PFS rate at 6 months for each 
treatment group was estimated using KM estimates on the PFS curve, and its corresponding 95% CI 
was derived based on Greenwood formula. 
•  Cohort 5  
As a secondary endpoint, the PFS curve for each treatment group was estimated using the KM method 
for all tumour types (pooled) and selected individual tumour types, if there was enough data. For each 
treatment group separately individual PFS was listed by tumour type after each subject reached 12 
months follow-up. In addition, as one of the secondary endpoints for Cohort 5, PFS rate at 6 months 
for each treatment group was estimated using KM estimates on the PFS curve, and its corresponding 
95% CI was derived based on Greenwood formula. 
Safety analyses 
Primary  safety analyses were performed for safety lead-in subjects, which included 3 groups: in 
Module A, the first 15 DLT-evaluable subjects in Cohort 1 (increased from 6 planned originally), and 
the first 10 DLT-evaluable subjects in Cohorts 2-5; in Module B, the first 16 DLT-evaluable subjects 
(increased from 10 planned originally).  
Secondary safety analyses were performed for all treated subjects and summarized by cohort and 
treatment. Safety analyses were performed for individual cohorts and for combined cohorts by 
treatment module. The safety population included all treated subjects.

Descriptive statistics of safety (both primary  and secondary) are presented using National Cancer 
Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 4.0. All on-study 
AEs, drug-related AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation, 
serious adverse events (SAEs), and drug-related SAEs are tabulated using worst grade per NCI CTCAE 
v 4.0 criteria by system organ class (SOC) and PT. On-study lab parameters  including hematology, 
chemistry, liver function, and renal function are summarized using worst grade per NCI CTCAE v 4.0 
criteria, and reported using International system of units (SI) and repeated using US conventional 
units. All on-study AEs and lab parameters  were summarized for the entire treatment period from the 
first dosing date to the last dosing date plus 30 days (30-day window).  
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
This study was conducted at 51 sites in 15 countries. Across all cohorts in Modules A and B, a total of 
204 subjects were enrolled, of whom 166 (81.4%) subjects entered the treatment period.  
For the primary  CSR, the clinical cut-off (last patient’s last visit [LPLV]) occurred on 19-Oct-2020 and 
the database lock (DBL) took place on 13-Jan-2021. For the purpose of the primary  CSR, study results 
were assessed after a minimum of 24 months follow-up for all subjects for the assessment of the 
primary  endpoint of OS (Cohort 1) and after a minimum  of 12 months follow-up for all subjects for the 
assessment of the primary  endpoint of PFS (Cohorts 2-5).  
A total of 85 and 81 subjects ≥ 6 months and < 22 years of age were treated with nivolumab 
monotherapy (Module A, Cohorts 1-5) or nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab  (Module B, 
Cohorts 1-5), respectively, in the overall, all-treated population of Study CA209908, based on a 
database lock (DBL) of 13-Jan-2021. Of these, 77 (90.6%) (Module A) and 74 (91.4%) (Module B) 
were < 18 years of age at the time of study enrolment. 
The numbers of subjects actually evaluated for DLTs were 15 in Cohort 1 (Module A), 10 in Cohorts 2-5 
(Module A), and 17 in Cohorts 2-5 (Module B), with 16 in the safety lead-in phase and 1 in the 
expansion phase. These changes from the planned numbers were implemented per recommendation of 
the SSC. 
Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics 
As per protocol,  at study entry, all subjects in Cohort 1 had newly diagnosed DIPG, all subjects in 
Cohorts 2, 3, and 4 had a diagnosis of recurrent or progressive HGG, relapsed or resistant 
medulloblastoma, and relapsed or resistant ependymoma, respectively, and Cohort 5 had subjects with 
other recurrent or progressive CNS tumours. Demographics and baseline characteristics were generally 
similar across individual cohorts and between the modules. The majority  of subjects in both modules, 
in both the overall and < 18 year populations, were white and male,  and from the US/Canada or 
Europe.  
In combined cohorts treated with nivolumab monotherapy: 
• 
• 
The median age was 10.0 years (range: 1 - 21 years) with 90.6% of subjects < 18 years.  
The majority of subjects were white (83.5%) and male (61.2%).

Disease characteristics 
Baseline characteristics of the overall and < 18 year populations, by module, are summarized in Table 
4 and Table 5, respectively. The majority of subjects in both modules, in both the overall (80.0% 
[nivolumab]; 82.7% [nivolumab + ipilimumab])  and < 18 year  (81.8% [nivolumab]; 82.4% 
[nivolumab + ipilimumab]) populations, had Karnofsky Performance Score (KPS)/ Lansky Play Score 
(LPS) of ≥ 80.0%.  
In both Module A and B, per protocol, all subjects in Cohort 1 treated with nivolumab monotherapy and 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab,  respectively, received prior  radiotherapy but none received prior  systemic 
cancer therapy. In Cohorts 2-5, most subjects received all 3 forms of prior therapy: radiotherapy, 
surgery related to cancer, and systemic anticancer therapy. This was also observed in the < 18 year 
population.

Efficacy results 
Exposure to study therapy 
In the all-treated <18 year population, in combined cohorts, for nivolumab monotherapy treated 
subjects, the proportion of subjects who received 90% to < 110% of the planned dose intensity was 
88.6% and the median number of doses received was 5 (range 1-87). For nivolumab/ipilimumab 
combination therapy treated subjects, the proportion of subjects who received 90% to < 110% of the 
planned dose intensity was 86.5% and the median number of doses received was 4 (range 1-
63).These parameters  were comparable  to the overall population.  
For nivolumab monotherapy-treated subjects, based on KM analysis, the median time to treatment 
discontinuation was 2.10 months in the combined cohorts (cohort 1: 4.17 months; cohort 2: 2.12 
months; cohort 3: 1.41 months; cohort 4: 1.87 months; cohort 5: 0.95 months). 
For nivolumab + ipilimumab-treated  subjects, based on KM analysis, the median time to treatment 
discontinuation was 2.12 in the combined cohorts (cohort 1: 3.68 months; cohort 2: 1.41 months;  
cohort 3: 4.63 months; cohort 4: 4.06 months; cohort 5: 1.45 months).

The primary  endpoints of OS in cohort 1 and PFS (by Investigator) in Cohorts 2-5 were short, 
indicating no meaningful benefit: 
•  Median OS of 11.66 months (80% CI: 10.32, 16.46) with nivolumab monotherapy and 
10.78 months (80% CI: 9.13, 15.77) with nivolumab + ipilimumab  in subjects with newly 
diagnosed DIPG (Cohort 1) 
•  Median PFS of 1.74 months (80% CI: 1.35, 2.73) with nivolumab monotherapy and 
1.31 months (80% CI: 1.18, 1.45) with nivolumab + ipilimumab  in subjects with recurrent or 
progressive HGG (Cohort 2) 
•  Median PFS of 1.38 months (80% CI: 1.22, 1.38) with nivolumab monotherapy and 
2.76 months (80% CI: 1.48, 4.53) with nivolumab + ipilimumab  in subjects with recurrent or 
progressive medulloblastoma (Cohort 3) 
•  Median PFS of 1.41 months (80% CI: 1.41, 2.60) with nivolumab monotherapy and 
4.60 months (80% CI: 1.41, 5.39) with nivolumab + ipilimumab  in subjects with recurrent or 
progressive ependymoma (Cohort 4) 
•  Median PFS of 1.22 months (95% CI: 1.08, 1.31) with nivolumab monotherapy and 
1.61 months (95% CI: 1.31, 3.45) with nivolumab + ipilimumab  in subjects with all other 
recurrent or progressive CNS tumours (Cohort 5). 
Efficacy by baseline PD-L1 expression 
Exploratory analyses for tumour PD-L1 were based on baseline PD-L1 positive status using 1% and 5% 
cutoffs. Of the 85 subjects treated with nivolumab monotherapy (Module A), 62 had evaluable PD-L1 
IHC results; of the 81 subjects treated with nivolumab + ipilimumab  (Module B), 57 had evaluable PD-
L1 IHC results. Data suggest that tumour PD-L1 ≥ 1% or ≥ 5% was not associated with improved OS 
relative to tumour PD-L1 < 1% or < 5%, respectively, for either nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab 
+ ipilimumab.  In combined cohorts, for both treatment regimens, CIs of both OS hazard ratios (HRs) 
(PD-L1 ≥ 1% vs PD-L1 < 1% and PD-L1 ≥ 5% vs PD-L1 < 5%) included 1, indicating no significant 
difference; however, small subgroup sizes preclude definitive conclusions 
All-treated (<18 year) population 
Efficacy results are summarized by cohort for nivolumab monotherapy (Module A) in Table 6 and 
nivolumab + ipilimumab  (Module B), for the all-treated <18 year population, in Table 7. 
As noted for the overall, all-treated population, the primary  endpoints of OS in Cohort 1 and PFS (by 
Investigator) in Cohorts 2-5 were short, indicating no meaningful benefit: 
•  Median OS of 10.97 months (80% CI: 9.92, 12.16) with nivolumab monotherapy and 
10.50 months (80% CI: 9.10, 12.32) with nivolumab + ipilimumab  in subjects < 18 years of 
age with newly diagnosed DIPG (Cohort 1) 
•  Median PFS of 2.35 months (80% CI: 1.35, 2.76) with nivolumab monotherapy and 
1.45 months (80% CI: 1.22, 1.48) with nivolumab + ipilimumab  in subjects < 18 years of age 
with recurrent or progressive HGG (Cohort 2) 
•  Median PFS of 1.38 months (80% CI: 1.22, 1.38) with nivolumab monotherapy and

Safety results 
As of the 13-Jan-2021 DBL (minimum follow-up: at least 24 months for OS; at least 12 months for 
PFS, where applicable),  the safety profiles of nivolumab monotherapy and nivolumab + ipilimumab)  in 
all treated subjects with high grade primary  CNS malignancies were consistent with those in other 
tumour types in adults, with no new safety signals observed. Safety results are presented for the all-
treated <18 year population only (n=77 nivolumab monotherapy and n=74 nivolumab + ipilimumab), 
but results were comparable to the all-treated population (n=85 for nivolumab monotherapy and n=81 
for nivolumab + ipilimumab).  
All-treated <18 year) population 
The median follow-up in combined cohorts was 8.08 months (range: 0.2 - 41.7) and 10.89 months 
(range: 0.7 - 34.7) for nivolumab monotherapy and nivolumab + ipilimumab  treated subjects, 
respectively. 
Safety Lead-in Phase 
As noted for the overall, all-treated population, no DLTs of any grade were reported in the lead-in 
phase in subjects < 18 years of age. 
Expansion Phase 
As was observed for the overall,  all-treated population, the overall safety profile of nivolumab 
monotherapy and nivolumab + ipilimumab  in subjects < 18 years of age was acceptable and consistent 
with the respective known safety profiles in the adult population. No meaningful differences were 
observed in safety results in paediatric (< 18 year old) subjects in Study CA209908 as compared with 
the overall, all-treated population; however, 1 DLT (treatment-related Grade 3 pancreatitis and Grade 
2 colitis) was noted for nivolumab + ipilimumab  during extended safety monitoring in the expansion 
phase in 1 subject in Cohort 5 (the subject was 13 years old).  
Nivolumab Monotherapy (Module A) 
In combined cohorts treated with nivolumab monotherapy, among subjects < 18 years of age: 
•  61 (79.2%) subjects had died. No deaths were attributed to study drug toxicity. 
• 
The frequency of drug-related SAEs was 11.7%.

•  Drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 11.7% of subjects.  
• 
The frequency of drug-related AEs was 55.8%; 14.3% of subjects had Grade 3-4 drug-related 
AEs. 
•  Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs reported in ≥ 2 subjects were neutrophil count decreased (3.9%), 
rash (2.6%), and platelet count decreased (2.6%). 
Nivolumab + Ipilimumab (Module B) 
In combined cohorts treated nivolumab + ipilimumab,  among subjects < 18 years of age: 
•  55 (74.3%) subjects had died. No deaths were attributed to study drug toxicity. 
• 
The frequency of drug-related SAEs was 27.0%. 
•  Drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 18.9% of subjects. 
• 
The frequency of drug-related AEs was 67.6%; 29.7% of subjects had Grade 3-4 drug-related 
AEs. 
•  Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs reported in ≥ 2 subjects were alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
increased (6.8%), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increased (5.4%), weight decreased 
(2.7%), and tumour flare (2.7%). 
Most select AEs and immune-mediated AEs (IMAEs) were Grade 1-2 in the < 18 year population were 
consistent with the overall,  all-treated population. A summary of safety results in the treated patients 
<18 year of age is presented in Table 8.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The MAH submitted the final CSR for study CA209908 as part of this Article 46 procedure. In this open-
label, uncontrolled study, 152 paediatric patients were treated with nivolumab monotherapy (n=77) or 
nivolumab + ipilimumab  combination therapy (n=74) in five cohorts based on different CNS tumour 
types.  
The primary  endpoints of OS in Cohort 1 (DIPG) and PFS in Cohorts 2-5 (other high-grade primary 
CNS malignancies) showed short survival. Results for OS and PFS were intended to be compared with 
the available historical controls (median OS of 9 months for DIPG, median PFS of 2.25 months for 
HGG, 4-month PFS rate of 18% for medulloblastoma and median PFS of 2.1 months for ependymoma). 
However,  given the limitations associated with the available historical controls (eg, single studies and 
small sample sizes) and the small precision on point estimates and CIs, no meaningful conclusions 
could be drawn based on comparison against the historical values.  
Across the 5 cohorts treated with nivolumab monotherapy, 1 patient with ependymoma had a partial 
response. The time to response was 2.83 months and, as of the data cut off, the DOR was 31.2 
months with the response still ongoing. There were no other responses on nivolumab monotherapy, 
and there were no responses in patients treated with nivolumab + ipilimumab.   
It is agreed with the Applicant that, overall,  results for OS, PFS, and objective response rate observed 
in Study CA209908 did not demonstrate clinically meaningful improvement over what is expected in 
these patient populations. These data therefore do not warrant further investigation of nivolumab or 
nivolumab + ipilimumab  in these tumour types. It is stated that no new indication will be pursued for 
these medicinal products in paediatric patients with CNS malignancies. 
The safety profiles of nivolumab monotherapy and nivolumab + ipilimumab  combination therapy in the 
evaluated overall, all-treated patient population with high-grade primary  CNS malignancies were 
acceptable, and consistent with previously reported studies in the adult population. Low rates of 
treatment discontinuation due to drug toxicity were observed. As expected, drug-related AEs, SAEs, 
select AEs, and IMAEs were more frequent with nivolumab + ipilimumab  relative to nivolumab 
monotherapy. One DLT was observed in 1 subject treated with nivolumab + ipilimumab  in Cohort 5 
during extended safety monitoring (treatment-related grade 3 pancreatitis and grade 2 colitis). There 
were no new safety signals identified. Safety in paediatric subjects (<18 year population, n=151) was 
similar to that observed in the overall, all-treated patient population (n=166). 
In summary,  in the overall population in Study CA209908, there was no evidence of efficacy with 
nivolumab alone or with nivolumab + ipilimumab  in subjects with high-grade primary CNS tumours (of 
whom 91% were paediatric patients) based on the primary  and key efficacy endpoints specified. No 
new safety signals were detected in the study. No updates to the Product Information of Opdivo or 
Yervoy are being proposed by the Applicant. This is not agreed, as the results from Study CA209908 
could be relevant for the prescriber.   
Currently, in section 5.1 of the Yervoy SmPC, only the results of 25 paediatric patients treated in 
studies CA184070 and CA184078 are described. This includes data on 17 melanoma patients, 
currently the only indication for Yervoy in the paediatric population. As concluded, the CA209908 study 
results do not support efficacy of either nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab + ipilimumab 
combination therapy in paediatric CNS tumours, there is no approval  for this indication in adults, these 
treatments are not included in guidelines nor suggested by literature. However,  considering the dismal 
prognosis of paediatric CNS tumours and the high unmet medical need in this population, treating 
physicians might consider immunotherapy as a treatment option. In this light, the lack of efficacy in

article 46 of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as am ended 
EMA/400368/2021  
Page 23/24 
 
 
 
Study CA209908 should be described in section 5.1 of the SmPC of Opdivo and Yervoy, as the reported 
study does provide new information.  
On the safety data, section 4.8 of the Yervoy SmPC contains safety data on 12 patients from 12-18 
years of age. The current study includes a much larger cohort of paediatric patients and a short study 
description including the primary  efficacy and safety findings should be included in the SmPC.  
Section 4.8 of the Opdivo SmPC does not include a subsection on the safety in the paediatric 
population. This section should be added to the SmPC with a description of the safety data from Study 
CA209908.  
Regarding posology, for Opdivo, which is not indicated in the paediatric population, the following 
statement is included in section 4.2 of the SmPC: 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of OPDIVO in children below 18 years of age have not been established. No 
data are available. 
For Yervoy,  the following is stated in section 4.2 of the SmPC: 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of YERVOY in children younger than 12 years of age have not been established. 
Very limited data are available. YERVOY should not be used in children younger than 12 years of age. 
Also this section should be updated for both the Opdivo and Yervoy SmPC’s, based on the results of 
study CA209908 submitted in the current procedure and in line with the SmPC guideline.  
3.  Overall conclusion and recommendation 
It is agreed with the Applicant that the results of Study CA209908 showed no evidence of efficacy with 
nivolumab alone or with nivolumab + ipilimumab  in subjects with high-grade primary CNS tumours (of 
whom 91% were paediatric patients), and that no new safety signals were detected in the study. 
However,  as this concerns new information which is of relevance to the prescriber,  the efficacy and 
safety results for Study CA209908 should be described in both the Yervoy and Opdivo SmPC’s. An 
update of sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 is warranted for Yervoy,  and an update of sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 
is warranted for Opdivo. The Applicant should propose and update of both SmPC’s via a separate type 
II variation procedure in line with the Paediatric Regulation. 
  Fulfilled: However, to improve the information available on the use of medicinal products in the 
paediatric population, relevant information on use in paediatric populations should be included in the 
authorised product information in line with the Paediatric regulation. The MAH should either submit a 
variation in accordance with Articles 16 and 17 of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 or provide a 
justification for not doing so. This should be provided without any delay and no later than 60 days after 
the receipt of these conclusions.

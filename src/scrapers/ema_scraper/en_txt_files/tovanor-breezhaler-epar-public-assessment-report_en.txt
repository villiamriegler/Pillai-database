2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an illness characterized by air flow limitation that is 
not fully reversible. It is usually progressive and is associated with pathological changes in the lung - a 
combination,  varying  between  individual  patients,  of  obstructive  bronchiolitis  and  parenchymal 
destruction  (emphysema).  The  principal  environmental  risk  factor  for  the  development  of  COPD  is 
exposure  to  tobacco  smoke,  but  occupational  or  other  exposure  to  some  chemicals  and  both  organic 
and inorganic dusts are also known to increase the risk. 
The  prevalence  of  COPD  in  the  population  is  difficult  to  estimate,  but  it  is  a  major  public  health 
problem.  Mortality  due  to  COPD  is  again  difficult  to  estimate,  but  appears  to  be  increasing.  Between 
1970 and 2002, deaths due to COPD doubled, in contrast to a decrease in deaths due to some other 
chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease (Jemal et al 2005). This is probably due to two factors, 
namely  the  aging  population,  and  the  fact  that  COPD  mortality  lags  trends  in  tobacco  smoking  by 
several decades. It is estimated that by 2020, COPD will be the third leading cause of global mortality 
(GOLD 2009).

The  aims  of  pharmacological  treatment  in  COPD,  as  described  in  the  GOLD  guideline  are  to  prevent 
and  control  symptoms,  to  reduce  the  frequency  and  severity  of  exacerbations,  to  improve  health 
status, and to improve exercise tolerance. GOLD guidelines recognize that bronchodilators (by reducing 
airflow limitation) are central to the management of symptoms in COPD and recommend regular use of 
long-acting bronchodilators for patients with moderate to severe COPD. Within the class of long-acting 
bronchodilators,  long-acting  β2  agonists  (LABAs)  and  long-acting  antimuscarinic  are  available.  While 
there  are  several  marketed  LABAs  such  as  formoterol,  salmeterol  and  indacaterol,  tiotropium  is  the 
only long-acting antimuscarinic (LAMA) currently available. LABAs and LAMAs are recommended first-
line treatments in moderate to severe COPD. The addition of a glucocorticosteroid is recommended as 
additional therapy for severe COPD (GOLD 2010).  
About the product 
Glycopyrronium  bromide,  (abbreviated  GP)  is  a  competitive  antagonist  at  muscarinic  receptors  in  the 
autonomic nervous system. It has little or no activity against nicotinic receptors, the other main class 
of  cholinergic  receptors.  Injectable  and  oral  forms of  GP  exist  and  are  marketed  in  several  countries. 
GP has been used for a long time in anaesthesia as a preoperative antimuscarinic to reduce the volume 
and free acidity of gastric secretion, to block cardiac vagal inhibition reflexes and to protect against the 
peripheral  muscarinic  actions  of  anticholinesterases.  GP  is  also  used  for  treatment  of  hyperhidrosis 
(abnormally increased sweating). The oral GP formulation was approved in the United States in 2010 
and is indicated for severe drooling in patients 3-16 years of age with neurologic conditions. 
A  dry  powder  formulation  of  glycopyrronium  bromide  has  been  developed  as  a  once  daily  (o.d.) 
inhalation  treatment  for  patients  with  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD)  under  the 
compound code NVA237. The clinical development program for NVA237 in patients with COPD provides 
the  basis  for  evaluating  the  prolonged  duration  of  action  and  clinical  effects  of  the  drug.  A  full 
toxicology and pharmacokinetics (PK) program has been conducted to support the clinical program. 
NVA237  is  to  be  administered  once  daily  (o.d.)  at a  dose  of  44 μg,  as  a  capsule  via  a low  resistance 
single dose dry powder inhaler (SDDPI), also referred to as ‘Concept1’. One NVA237 capsule contains 
50  µg  of  the  active  substance  glycopyrronium  (metered  dose)  and  is  delivered  to  the  lung  as  an 
inhalation  powder  via  the  Breezhaler  inhaler  device.  The  delivered  dose  (the  dose  that  leaves  the 
mouthpiece of the Breezhaler inhaler) is equivalent to 44 µg glycopyrronium. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: once daily maintenance bronchodilator treatment to 
relieve symptoms of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
The  approved  indication  was:  maintenance  bronchodilator  treatment  to  relieve  symptoms  in  adult 
patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). 
The  initial  clinical  development  of  glycopyrronium  bromide  was  performed  by  Arakis  using  the  Miat 
Monohaler, a device similar to the Concept1 device used by the Applicant in the current development 
program.  A  total  of  292  patients  with  COPD  received  GP  once-daily;  data  from  these  studies  showed 
that  inhaled  glycopyrronium  bromide  is  well-tolerated  and  suitable  for  use  as  a  once-daily 
bronchodilator. These studies are not directly referred to, as Novartis conducted a stand-alone clinical 
development program using its own Concept1 device for all studies. 
Type of Application and aspects of development 
Glycopyrronium  bromide  is  submitted  as  a  full  application  referring  to  Article  8(3)  in  Directive 
2001/83/EC  via  the  optional  scope  of  the  centralised  procedure  for  a  known  active  substance  in 
accordance with article 3(2)(b) (significant therapeutic innovation) in accordance to Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Tovanor Breezhaler is presented as an inhalation powder in hard capsules, containing glycopyrronium 
bromide as the active substance, glycopyrronium being the active moiety. Each capsule contains 63 µg 
of glycopyrronium bromide (metered dose), equivalent to 50 µg of glycopyrronium. The delivered dose 
(the dose that leaves the mouthpiece of the inhaler) is equivalent to 44 µg of glycopyrronium (55 µg of 
glycopyrronium bromide). 
The  product  is  presented  in  hypromellose  hard  capsules  containing  the  active  substance  mixed  with 
two excipients lactose monohydrate and magnesium stearate. The powder is enclosed in hard capsules 
composed  of  hypromellose,  carrageenan,  potassium  chloride  and  Sunset  Yellow  FCF  (E110).  The 
capsules  (size  3)  are  orange,  transparent  with  black  Novartis  logo  under  black  radial  bar  on  cap  and 
black ‘GPL 50’ above black radial bar on body. Printing ink consists of shellac and black iron oxide and 
several solvents which are removed during imprinting.  
The capsules are packed in PA/alu/PVC – alu perforated unit dose blisters.  
Tovanor  Breezhaler  is  a  single-dose  inhaler.  Inhaler  body  and  cap  are  made  from  acrylonitrile 
butadiene  styrene,  push  buttons  are  made  from  methyl  metacrylate  acrylonitrile  butadiene  styrene. 
Needles and springs are made from stainless steel. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Glycopyrronium bromide, the active substance of Tovanor Breezhaler, is a well known active substance, 
chemically  designated  as  3-(2-cyclopentyl-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetoxy)-1,1-dimethylpyrrolidinium 
bromide  or  (3RS)-3-[(2SR)-(2-cyclopentyl-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetyl)oxy]-1,1-dimethylpyrrolidinium 
bromide, and has the following structure: 
It is a white, non-hygroscopic powder, freely soluble in water, soluble in ethanol (96%), very slightly 
soluble  in  methylene  chloride.  The  substance  is  also  freely  soluble  in  simulated  lung  fluid  (phosphate 
buffer pH 7.4).  
Glycopyrronium bromide is a quaternary ammonium salt (ionic compound) and it is completely ionized 
between  pH  1  and  14.  It  is  a  racemic  mixture  of  the  3R,2S  and  3S,2R  stereoisomers.  No  optical 
rotation is seen in solution. Only single polymorphic form (crystalline Form A) has been reported. 
The  chemical  structure  of  glycopyrronium  bromide  has  been  confirmed  by  means  of  UV,  IR,  1H-  and 
13C-NMR  spectroscopy  and  mass  spectrometry  (MS).  The  content  of  carbon,  oxygen,  hydrogen, 
Tovanor Breezhaler

Page 8/84
 
 
 
 
 
 
nitrogen and bromide has been determined by elemental analysis. The structure and stereochemistry 
of the active substance has been determined by means of X-ray crystallography. 
Manufacture 
The active substance is manufactured by a synthesis which consists of a number of chemical reaction 
steps followed by crystallisation and several re-crystallisation steps. 
The manufacturing process has been described in sufficient detail including suitable reaction schemes. 
The amounts of raw materials, yields, and equipment have been specified, and the in-process controls 
have  been  well  described.  Appropriate  specifications  for  starting  materials  and  reagents  have  been 
proposed.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on  chemistry  of  new  active  substances.  Potential impurities  were  well  discussed  with  regards  to  their 
origin and characterised. 
Specification 
The active substance specification, including parameters, analytical procedures and acceptance criteria 
was considered suitable for release of batches of active substance. The specification complies with the 
requirements of the Ph. Eur. monograph and the Q3A (R), Q3C and Q6A ICH guidelines. Justifications 
have been presented for each of the requirements listed in the specification. 
The  specification  includes  tests  for  appearance,  identification  (IR,  X-ray  diffraction  and  HPLC), 
Impurities  including  stereoisomeric  purity  (HPLC),  residual  solvents  (GC),  loss  on  drying,  sulphated 
ash, heavy metals, acidity or alkalinity, colour of solution, assay (HPLC or titration) and microbiological 
purity.  The  micronized  active  substance,  stabilized  by  an  added  excipient,  is  controlled  regarding 
particle size distribution and it is a critical quality parameter in relation to the finished product 
The  descriptions  of  the  analytical  methods  are  considered  acceptable  and  their  validations  are 
performed in accordance with ICH standards and Ph. Eur. requirements.   
Batch  analytical  data  have  been  provided  for  batches  of  the  active  substance  used  in  non-clinical, 
clinical and stability studies as well as batches manufactured at the production site using the proposed 
final manufacturing process. All batches comply with the proposed specifications. Batch analysis results 
confirm batch to batch consistency and support uniformity of the quality of the active substance.  
Stability 
Stability  data  from  long  term  and  accelerated  stability  studies  on  6  batches  covering  storage  periods 
up to 36 months, photostability testing and stress testing under different conditions were submitted. 
Batches  were  also  stored  under  intermediate  condition  to  be  tested  if  significant  changes  were  seen 
under accelerated conditions. Studies were also made on the 6 batches stored in refrigerator and the 
batches were also stored in a freezer only to be tested if significant changes were seen after storage in 
the refrigerator. 
The  applicant  has  also  submitted  three  months  stability  data  at  25°C/60%  RH  and  40°C/75%  RH  for 
three production scale batches.  
Stability program was supplemented by a photostability study, stress testing (storage for one month at 
50°C,  60°C  and  80°C),  forced  decomposition  studies  (3  day  heated  in  aqueous  solution  under  acidic, 
alkaline,  neutral  and  oxidising  conditions),  isomerisation  study  (storage  for  one  month  at  50°C

exposed  to  acid,  alkaline  and  neutral  conditions)  and  hygroscopicity  (58% RH  and  75% RH 
1 week/80% RH and 93% RH 1 day).  
Results  obtained  from  the  submitted  stability  program  indicate  very  good  stability  of  glycopyrronium 
bromide  in  the  solid  state.  No  evidence  of  instability  was  observed  under  long  term  or  accelerated 
conditions  when  samples  were  stored  in  the  proposed  container  closure  system.  Glycopyrronium 
bromide was not photosensitive. 
The  stability  data  provided  support  the  recommended  retest  period  at  the  proposed  packaging  and 
storage conditions. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The  principle  of  the  dry  powder  formulation  for  inhalation  is  the  homogeneous  attachment  of  fine 
particles of the active substance, present as a small percentage of the formulation, on the surface  of 
comparatively  coarse  particles  of  a  free-flowing  inert  carrier  (lactose).  During  inhalation,  the  dry 
powder dose is entrained into the turbulent airflow generated in the Concept1 mouthpiece, leading to 
the detachment of the active substance particles from the surface of the coarse carrier particles. Once 
released from the carrier, particles of the active substance are inhaled and deposited into the lungs. 
As  the  method  of  administration  is  by  inhalation,  particle  size  is  critical  and  must  be  controlled  to 
achieve the required lung deposition profile. Throughout the development the formulation used during 
phase  II  and  III  studies  were  identical  in  composition  and  this  formulation  is  also  the  proposed 
commercial quantitative formula, apart from the capsule colours. Colourless clear capsules were used 
in  the  clinical  studies  vs.  transparent  orange  capsules  proposed  for  the  commercial  product.  The 
performance  of  both  capsules  was  compared  and  was  shown  to  be  equivalent  based  on  aerodynamic 
particle size distribution and average delivered dose. 
The finished product is administered with a single-dose dry powder inhaler ‘Concept1’, also referred to 
as the Breezhaler device. Concept1 is currently used for already marketed product Onbrez Breezhaler. 
The  pharmaceutical  performance  of  the  inhalation  powder,  hard  capsules  in  conjunction  with  the 
Concept1  inhalation  device  has  been  investigated.  The  Fine  Particle  Mass  (FPM)  and  Delivered  Dose 
Uniformity  (DDU)  were  investigated  at  different  flow  rates  (i.e.  30  to  100  L/min)  covering  well  the 
relevant ranges for COPD patients’ inspiratory flow rates through the low resistance Concept1 device. 
A number of different studies have been performed to demonstrate the suitability of the device for this 
product  including  DDU  and  FPM  over  patient  flow  rate  range,  single  dose  fine  particle  mass,  particle 
size  distribution,  actuator  deposition,  cleaning  requirements,  environmental  moisture  effects, 
robustness and device delivery development. 
The device is intended for 30 days of use (30 doses). A Concept1 inhaler is provided in each pack and 
the SmPC (section 6.6) states that the inhaler should be disposed after 30 days of use. 
The development of the product has been satisfactorily performed and explained and is in accordance 
with  EU  guidelines  on  Development  pharmaceutics  and  EMEA/CHMP/QWP/49313/2005  Corr.  on  the 
Pharmaceutical  Quality  of  Inhalation  and  Nasal  Products.  Particle  size  requirements  for  both  active 
substance  and  excipients  have  been  justified  in  terms  of  their  contributions  to  finished  product 
performance characteristics. Device cleaning has been properly addressed during the development and 
are reflected in the Product Information. 
It is a Class I medical device and its conformity with directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices 
has been certified by Novartis Pharma AG in a ‘declaration of conformity’ dated October 2008.

The packaging materials have shown suitability by acceptable product performance characteristics and 
stability studies. 
Adventitious agents 
The supplier of lactose monohydrate certified that it is produced from milk obtained from healthy cattle 
under the same conditions as milk intended for human consumption. 
Magnesium stearate is of vegetal origin and relevant certificates from manufacturers of this excipient 
have been provided. 
Manufacture of the product 
The  manufacturing  process  of  the  finished  product  involves  a  preparation  of  a  Pharmaceutical 
Intermediate (PI). In the next steps the PI is blended with excipients and the powder blend is filled into 
hard capsules. 
The  manufacture  of  the  PI  has  been  validated  for  3  commercial  scale  batches  using  the  same 
manufacturing  facilities  and  equipment  as  intended  for  commercial  batches.  The  quality  of  the  PI  is 
adequately  controlled  and  based  on  the  validation  results  a  homogenous  product,  with  the  target 
product characteristics, is obtained with the manufacturing process described. 
The  manufacturing  process  has  been  validated  for  commercial  scale  batches,  which  is  considered 
appropriate because of the pharmaceutical dose form and the manufacturing process. The final blend 
uniformity,  content  uniformity  of  the  capsules  through  the  encapsulation  process,  fine  particle  mass 
through  the  encapsulation  process  and  delivered  dose  uniformity  through  the  encapsulation  process 
were evaluated. Operating parameters and in-process controls were studied to evaluate their effects on 
the  final  drug  product  properties.  Based  on  this  analysis,  critical  steps  were  identified  and  in-process 
control acceptance criteria were defined. 
Data  presented  during  the  process  evaluation  indicate  that  the  manufacturing  process  of  the  PI, 
inhalation  powder  hard  capsules  and  the  blistering  process  consistently  yields  bulk  product,  which 
meets  the  predetermined  quality  characteristics.  Moreover,  the  chosen  in  process  tests  have  been 
shown to be suitable for monitoring the manufacturing process. 
The  conclusion  from  the  presented  data  was  that  the  ranges  and  values  chosen  for  the  processing 
parameters were acceptable to support the commercial manufacture of the product. The manufacturing 
process is well controlled and capable of producing a product of consistent quality.

Stability of the product 
Stability  studies  have  been  conducted  on  three  batches  manufactured  at  the  intended  site  of 
manufacture, at the intended production scale and packaged in the proposed container closure system. 
The  stability  studies  have  been  carried  out  according  to  ICH  requirements.  Batches  of  the  finished 
product  were  stored  under  the  long  term  conditions  (25°C/60% RH),  intermediate  conditions 
(30°C/65% RH) and accelerated conditions (40°C/75% RH). In addition one batch was been stored in 
refrigerator (5°C/ambient) and freezer (-20°C/ambient). 
Stability program included also testing of the intermediate product and bulk capsules. 
No significant changes were observed during the stability studies. On the basis of the provided stability 
data, the assigned shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SmPC is well supported.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A  full  nonclinical  programme  has  been  conducted  to  support  the  clinical  program.  The  safety 
pharmacology studies as well as pivotal toxicology studies were all conducted in compliance with GLP 
regulations.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro pharmacology studies 
Based on studies in transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, the binding affinity constants and 
rate parameters of NVA237 and its enantiomers were determined at the human M1, M2, M3, M4 and 
M5  muscarinic  acetylcholine  receptors  (mACh).  The  affinity  of  NVA237  towards  the  muscarinic 
receptors was M1 (Ki = 0.15 nM)> M3 > M2/M4 > M5. Moreover, the majority of the biological activity 
resides in the [3S, 2R] enantiomer of NVA237 which has 100-fold greater activity for the M3 receptor 
than the [3R, 2S] enantiomer. 
The  anti-cholinergic  bronchodilator  tiotropium  displayed  higher  binding  affinity  towards  the  M1,  M2, 
M3, M4 and M5 receptors than NVA237 at 37oC in an assay buffer containing physiological sodium ion 
concentration.  Hence,  NVA237  displayed  a  10-fold  lower  affinity  towards  the  M3  receptor  than 
tiotropium. Although the M1 to M4 receptors have been identified in the human lung, the excitatory M3 
receptors  located  on  airway  smooth  muscle  cell  are  considered  the  prime  mediators  of  cholinergic 
bronchoconstriction. 
The  faster  dissociation  rate  of  NVA237  (koff  =  0.07  ±  0.004)  compared  to  tiotropium  (koff  =  0.015  ± 
0.002)  at  the  M3  receptor  indicates  that  NVA237  will  have  a  shorter  dissociation  half  life  than 
tiotropium  (t½  =  9.9  versus  46.2  minutes).  Considering  the  relatively  short  half  lives,  it  is  likely  that 
other factors contribute to the extended duration of action of NVA237 and tiotropium than M3 receptor 
residency time. 
The receptor kinetic data suggest that at equi-effective concentrations, NVA237 will reach equilibrium 
faster  than  tiotropium  bromide  and  thus  potentially  demonstrate  a  faster  onset  of  action.  This 
assumption  was  based  on  calculations  of  the  time  taken  for  NVA237  and  tiotropium  to  associate  to 
50% of the receptor population (t1/2 for association = 0.693/(kon.[ligand]+koff)), which is 6.2 minutes 
for NVA237 versus 23.9 minutes for tiotropium at their respective K d concentrations. 
In vivo pharmacology 
The  efficacy  and  duration  of  action  of  different  formulations  (aqueous,  dry  powder  and  controlled 
release)  of  NVA237  on  methacholine-induced  bronchoconstriction  were  evaluated  in  anaesthetized 
rabbits.  Administration  of  methacholine  (10  µg  kg-1,  IV)  evoked  an  increase  in  pulmonary  inflation 
pressure  and  was  associated  with  a  decrease  in  heart  rate  which  was  accompanied  by  a  fall in  mean 
arterial  blood  pressure.  Intra-tracheal  (IT)  administration  of  all  the  formulations  of  NVA237  or 
ipratropium  tested  inhibited  the  increase  in  pulmonary  inflation  pressure  evoked  by  methacholine 
administration  by  approximately  90%.  However,  only  ipratropium  attenuated  the  cardiovascular 
response  mediated  by  methacholine.  Aqueous  and  dry  powder  formulations  of  NVA237  (20  µg  IT)  as 
well  as  ipatropium  (20  µg  IT)  exhibited  a  duration  of  action  of  6  hours.  The  controlled  released 
formulation  increased  the  duration  of  action  when  compared  to  a  comparable  dose  (10  µg  IT)  of  the 
dry powder formulation by 50%.

The  aim  of  a  second  study  in  anaesthetized  rabbits  was  the  efficacy  and  duration  of  action  of 
tiotropium  on  methacholine-induced  bronchoconstriction  as  well  as  potential  side-effect  on  the 
cardiovascular  system.  Intra-tracheal  administration  of  tiotropium  (3  µg)  attenuated  the  increase  in 
pulmonary  inflation  pressure  as  well  the  bradycardia  and  the  hypotension  evoked  by  methacholine 
administration.  In  contrast  to  tiotropium  and  to  some  extent  also  ipratropium,  IT  administration  of 
NVA237 did not significantly affect neither heart rate nor mean blood pressure.  
Moreover,  the  ability  of  the  NVA237  to  suppress  methacholine-induced  bronchoconstriction  was 
investigated in spontaneously breathing, anaesthetised rhesus monkeys and the effects compared with 
those  seen  following  tiotropium  and  ipratropium.  NVA237  was  administered  as  an  aerosol  at  mean 
dose levels of 0.05, 0.15, 0.31 and 0.61 μg/kg intratracheally (IT). NVA237 induced dose-, and time-
dependent inhibition of methacholine-induced bronchoconstriction with the maximal response observed 
15  minutes  following  drug  inhalation  (first  time  point).  Around  80%  inhibition  of  bronchoconstriction 
was  observed  15  minutes  following  the  start  of  inhalation  of  0.31  µg/kg  NVA237  and  0.014  µg/kg 
tiotropium,  respectively.  Similarly,  15  minutes  following  start  of  inhalation,  approximately  90% 
inhibition of bronchoconstriction was observed for 0.96 µg/kg ipratropium. Tiotropium (0.14 µg/kg IT) 
exerted  the  most  potent  inhibition  of  methacholine-induced  bronchoconstriction  with  around  80% 
inhibition  of  bronchoconstriction  still  observed  around  5  hours  post-dosing.  NVA237  and  ipratropium 
(0.61 and 0.96 µg/kg IT, respectively) displayed a lower potency with only 65% and 35% inhibition of 
bronchoconstriction at approximately 5 hours post-dosing.  
NVA237  and  tiotropium  were  compared  in  anaesthetized  Brown  Norway  rats  IV  administered 
methacholine (0.03, 0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10, 30, 100 μg kg-1 at 5 minute intervals) with respect to effects on 
lung  function,  salivation  and  cardiovascular  parameters.  The  effects  were  evaluated  at  1,  6  and  24 
hours  following  drug  treatment.  Tiotropium  was  the  most  potent  inhibitor  of  methacholine-induced 
bronchoconstriction  hence  at  24  hours  post-dosing  the  ED50  values  for  NVA237  and  tiotropium  were 
1.2  and  0.14  µg/kg,  respectively.  However,  at  all  the  time  points  studied,  NVA237  demonstrated  an 
improved therapeutic index with respect to effects on salivation, hypotension and bradycardia. Hence, 
1 hour post-dosing, the therapeutic index varied from 8.8 to 28-fold for NVA237 and from 1.5 to 4.2 
for tiotropium. 
Glycopyrronium  is  a  racemate  (i.e.  a  1:1  mixture)  of  the  two  enantiomers  QBA608  ([3S,  2R]-threo-
isomer) and QBA609 ([3R,2S]-threo-isomer. Although the M1 to M3 receptors have been identified in 
the  human  lung,  the  excitatory  M3  receptors  located  on  airway  smooth  muscle  are  considered  the 
prime mediators of cholinergic bronchoconstriction. Based on pharmacological considerations, an ideal 
anticholinergic  bronchodilating  agent  would  inhibit  only  the  M1  and  M3  receptors  and  spare  the  M2 
receptors  as  the  latter  is  believed  to  protect  against  parasympathetic-mediated  bronchoconstriction. 
The binding affinity constants (pKi values) for glycopyrronium binding to the muscarinic acetylcholine 
receptors  M1,  M2,  M3,  M4  and  M5  were  9.69,  9.25,  9.64,  9.06  and  8.91,  respectively.  Hence, 
glycopyrronium displays around 2.5-fold higher binding affinity towards the M1 and M3 receptors when 
compared  to  the  M2  receptor.  Functional  studies  demonstrated  that  glycopyrronium  exerts  an 
antagonistic effect at the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors while no agonistic effect was observed at 
concentrations up to 10 µM.  
The majority of the biological activity resides in the [3S, 2R] enantiomer of NVA237 which has 100-fold 
greater activity for the M3 receptor than the [3R, 2S] enantiomer. 
The anticholinergic bronchodilator tiotropium displayed higher binding affinity towards the M1, M2, M3, 
M4  and  M5  receptors  than  glycopyrronium.  Hence,  glycopyrronium  displayed  a  10-fold  lower  affinity 
towards the M3 receptor than tiotropium.  
The faster dissociation rate of glycopyrronium (koff = 0.07) compared to tiotropium (koff = 0.015) at 
the M3 receptor indicates that glycopyrronium will have a shorter dissociation half life than tiotropium

(t½  =  9.9  and  46.2  minutes,  respectively).  Considering  the  relatively  short  half  lives,  it  is  likely  that 
other factors contribute to the extended duration of action of glycopyrronium and tiotropium than M3 
receptor residency time. 
Receptor  kinetic  data  suggest  that  at  equieffective  concentrations,  glycopyrronium  will  reach 
equilibrium  faster  than  tiotropium  bromide  and  thus  potentially  demonstrate  a  faster  onset  of  action. 
This  assumption  was  based  on  calculations  of  the  time  taken  for  glycopyrronium  and  tiotropium  to 
associate  to  50%  of  the  receptor  population,  which  is  6.2  minutes  for  glycopyrronium  versus  23.9 
minutes for tiotropium at their respective Kd concentrations. 
The  efficacy  and  duration  of  action  of  intratracheally  (IT)  administered  glycopyrronium  and  the  anti-
cholinergic  bronchodilators  ipatropium  and  tiotropium  on  methacholine-induced  bronchoconstriction 
were  evaluated  in  anaesthetized  rats,  rabbits  and  rhesus  monkeys.  Intravenous  administration  of 
methacholine evokes an increase in pulmonary inflation pressure and is associated with a decrease in 
heart rate, which is accompanied by a fall in mean arterial blood pressure. Intratracheal administration 
of  glycopyrronium,  ipratropium  and  tiotropium  inhibited  the  increase  in  pulmonary  inflation  pressure 
evoked  by  methacholine  administration  by  approximately  80  to  90%.  In  anaesthetized  rhesus 
monkeys,  tiotropium  (0.14  µg/kg  IT)  exerted  the  most  potent  inhibition  of  methacholine-induced 
bronchoconstriction  with  around  80%  inhibition  of  bronchoconstriction  still  observed  around  5  hours 
post-dosing. Glycopyrronium and ipratropium (0.61 and 0.96 µg/kg IT, respectively) displayed a lower 
potency  with  only  65%  and  35%  inhibition  of  bronchoconstriction  at  approximately  5  hours  post-
dosing.  Tiotropium  was  the  most  potent  inhibitor  of  methacholine-induced  bronchoconstriction  in 
anaesthetized rats, hence at 24 hours post-dosing the ED50 values for glycopyrronium and tiotropium 
were 1.2 and 0.14 µg/kg, respectively.  
However, at all the time points studied, glycopyrronium demonstrated an improved therapeutic index 
with  respect  to  effects  on  salivation,  hypotension  and  bradycardia.  Hence,  1  hour  post-dosing,  the 
therapeutic index varied from 8.8 to 28-fold for glycopyrronium and from 1.5 to 4.2 for tiotropium.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In guinea pig and human isolated tracheal smooth muscle studies, NVA237 (10 nM) was shown to have 
no  effect  on  neurokinin  A-induced  contraction  (1  μM,  n=4),  indicating  the  selectivity  of  NVA237  for 
cholinergic pathways (Villetti et al., 2006). 
The  individual  enantiomers  of  NVA237  were  evaluated  for  activity  in  a  wide  range  of  enzyme  and 
radioligand  binding  assays.  No  activity  was  observed  in  the  panel  of  enzyme  assays  for  both 
enantiomers.  At  10  μM  both  enantiomers  partially  inhibited  ligand  binding  at  the  Sigma  σ1  receptor; 
however the reduced potency in comparison to binding at the M3 muscarinic receptor (approximately 
10,000  fold)  indicates  that  this  off  target  binding  will  not  occur  at  pharmacological  doses.  The 
metabolite  M9  (CJL603)  is  a  racemic  carboxylic  acid  derivative  formed  by  hydrolysis  of  NVA237.  A 
single enantiomer of metabolite M9, QAW665, was assessed for its muscarinic (M1-M5) and off-target 
activity  in  a  panel  of  65  G-protein  coupled  receptors,  transporters,  ion  channels  and  enzymes.  No 
significant  binding  to  any  of  these  targets  was  found  up  to  a  concentration  of  10  μM,  indicating  that 
QAW665 lacks pharmacological activity. 
In enzyme and radioligand bindings assays, the glycopyrronium [3S,2R] and [3R,2S] enantiomers did 
not  display  activity  towards  a  range  of  potential  secondary  targets.  Moreover,  the  glycopyrronium 
metabolite  M9  was  devoid  of  activity  against  muscarinic  receptors  (M1-M5)  and  a  wide  panel  of  G-
protein coupled receptors, transporters, ion channels and enzymes.

Safety pharmacology programme 
In safety pharmacology studies no treatment related effects were seen on the central nervous system 
(except for slight and transient pupil dilation) or respiratory system in rats at an inhaled dose of 0.168 
mg/kg  glycopyrronium  (i.e.,  >30-fold the  recommended  clinical dose  based  on  the  human  equivalent 
dose). 
Inhibition  of  the  hERG  current  was  only  observed  at  concentrations  significantly  higher  than  the 
maximum human exposure (Cmax) at the recommended clinical dose. Following administration of 0.01 
mg/kg IV (i.e., a 4-fold higher plasma exposure level than that observed clinically based on AUC data), 
transient effects were seen on heart rate and blood pressure in Beagle dogs. Following an inhaled dose 
of 0.149 mg/kg (i.e., >100-fold the recommended clinical dose based on allometric scaling using body 
surface  area),  transient  increases  in  heart  rate  and  transient  decreases  in  heart  rate-corrected  QT-
intervals  were  observed.  However,  also  PR  and  P  widths  were  affected  at  this  dose.  Moreover, 
tachycardia was a frequent finding in the dog repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No  studies  of  pharmacodynamic  drug  interaction  have  been  performed  which  was  considered 
acceptable  from  a  non-clinical  perspective  given  the  lack  of  binding  to  other  drug  targets,  the  vast 
clinical experience with inhaled anti-muscarinic drugs in respiratory medicine and the lack of NVA237 
induced inhibition or induction of CYP450 enzymes or other transporters.   
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Bioanalytical methods 
LC-MS/MS  methods  were  used  to  evaluate  the  concentration  of  glycopyrronium  in  plasma  of  mice, 
rats,  rabbits  and  dogs.  Although  some  deficiencies  were  identified  in  the  validation  procedures  (e.g., 
inter-assay variability was generally not investigated, and limited number of replicates, e.g., less than 
5  replicates  at  each  concentration),  the  performance  of  the  methods  (i.e.,  sensitivity  and 
reproducibility) are considered acceptable for regulatory purposes.  
Stability was  demonstrated  in  mouse,  rat  and  dog  plasma  for  up  to  at  least  10  weeks  during  sample 
storage at -20°C. 
Improper handling of samples and/or ineffective cleaning of the auto sampler system led to carry-over 
in the validation studies, which could account for at least a 10% contamination of the blank samples. 
In  several  of  the  pivotal  toxicity,  the  drug  substance  was  detected  in  plasma  samples  obtained  from 
the control group. These observations could probably be explained by improper handling/cleaning. The 
effect on the conclusions of the individual studies is discussed in the Toxicology section. 
The pivotal toxicity studies were performed using validated bioanalytical assays. 
Absorption 
Pharmacokinetic  investigations  were  only  conducted  in  male  rats.  The  interspecies  and  exposure 
analysis  relies  primarily  on  the  TK  data.  Due  to  the  lack  of  pharmacokinetic  parameters  such  as  T½, 
conclusions  concerning  exposure  should  preferably  be  based  on  AUC  data  in  the  pivotal  toxicity 
studies. 
The  absolute  bioavailability  of  inhaled  glycopyrronium  was  approximately  40%  in  humans,  which  is 
considerably  lower  than  that  observed  in  rats  following  IT  application  (96%).  The  absolute  oral 
bioavailability  of  glycopyrronium  was  low  in  both  rats  and  humans  (≤5%).  This  means  that  the 
Tovanor Breezhaler 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/508244/2012 
Page 16/84
 
 
majority  of  the  swallowed  dose  fraction  following  inhalation  of  glycopyrronium  in  humans  is  either 
subject to extensive first-pass metabolism or not absorbed and excreted in the faeces.  
Following administration of the racemic compound, the exposure to the two enantiomers QBA608 and 
QBA609  was  nearly  similar  in  rats  and  dogs.  Nevertheless,  there  was  general  tendency  to  a  slightly 
higher exposure to the QBA608, which may be due to the presence of an enantiomer-specific process 
for  QBA608  but  not  for  QBA609.  However,  this  hypothesis  has  not  been  pursued  further  by  the 
applicant. Furthermore, there was also some limited evidence of inter-individual variability in terms of 
chiral interconversion.  
The disposition of the enantiomers in humans following inhalation of glycopyrronium was characterized 
by  measuring  the  excretion  of  the  enantiomers  in  urine  (the  lower  LOQ  was  250  pg/mL  for  each 
enantiomer in urine as compared with 3-4 pg/mL for the racemic compound in plasma). The amounts 
excreted  and  the  excretion  rates  of  the  two  enantiomers  were  similar.  In  both  COPD  patients  and 
healthy volunteers and after single and repeated dosing of NVA237, the mean QBA608/QBA609 ratios 
was close to 1.0 (range 0.85-1.04). 
The  formation  of  the  diastereomers  QBI596  and  QBI597  could  not  be  demonstrated,  neither  in  rat 
plasma nor in human urine. 
The  maximum  concentration  Cmax  of  glycopyrronium  was  generally  observed  at  completion  of  the 
inhalation period; except in rabbits, where the individual Tmax ranged from 2 to 24 hours after the start 
of the inhalation exposure indicating a possible time-delayed absorption in this species.  
The  exposure  to  glycopyrronium  increased  with  increasing  doses  in  a  roughly  proportional  manner 
although  a  trend  of  under-proportionality  was  noted  in  several  studies.  Generally,  no  systemic 
accumulation was noted in the toxicology species rat and dog following repeated dosing (in contrast to 
pregnant  rabbit).  Local  accumulation  in  the  lung  was  noted  following  repeated  dosing  in  rats  (not 
investigated in other species).  
No obvious gender differences were observed during the toxicokinetic investigations. Hence, the use of 
males only for the majority of the pharmacokinetic studies is considered acceptable. 
The  disposition  of  glycopyrronium  was  characterised  by  a  multi-exponential  decline  in  rats  and 
humans.  After  inhalation,  the  apparent  terminal  half-life  differed  between  the  clinical  studies  with 
means  between  13  and  57  hours,  whereas  no  reliable  terminal  half-lives  have  been  estimated  in  the 
animal species. 
Distribution 
Following  IV  administration  of  radiolabelled  glycopyrronium,  total  radiolabelled  components  were 
located  extravascularly  and  rapidly  distributed  throughout  the  body.  High  levels  of  radioactivity  were 
observed  in  highly  perfused  tissues  (kidney,  liver,  small  intestine  and  various  glands)  Although 
glycopyrronium-related  material  was  eliminated  fast  from  most  tissues,  several  tissues  (eye,  brown 
fat, Harderian gland, kidney and liver) had a significantly slow elimination.  
In  pigmented  mice  and  rats,  radioactivity  levels  in  the  eye  and  skin  were  generally  above  those 
observed  in  blood.  This  indicates  that  the  radiolabelled  components  were  taken  up  and  retained  in 
melanin-containing  structures.  The  uptake  was  at  least  partly  reversible.  Otherwise,  distribution  in 
non-pigmented  and  pigmented  rats  was  generally  comparable.  Furthermore,  the  distribution  was 
comparable  following  IT,  IV  and  PO  administration;  only  measurements  in  gastro-intestinal-related 
tissues were qualitatively higher following PO administration. 
Glycopyrronium binds weakly to plasma proteins (range 23-44%) in all species tested (i.e., mice, rats, 
rabbits,  dogs,  and  humans).  Generally,  the  plasma  protein  binding  was  comparable  between  the 
Tovanor Breezhaler 
CHMP assessment report

Page 17/84
 
 
species  although  the  values  were  slightly  higher  for  rabbits  and  humans.  Hence,  the  free  drug 
concentrations are expected to be slightly higher in the toxicological species than in humans. Binding 
studies  conducted  with  purified  human  serum  albumin  and  1  acid  glycoprotein  indicated  that  the 
observed  plasma  protein  binding  in  humans  cannot  solely  be  explained  by  binding  to  these  two 
proteins.  Although  a  slight  concentration-dependency  in  plasma  protein  binding  was  observed  in  all 
species, it is considered without any relevance for the interpretation of the safety data. 
The blood/plasma concentration ratios were comparable between species (0.48-0.67) with no apparent 
concentration-dependency.  Plasma  is  a  suitable  matrix  for  monitoring  of  glycopyrronium  as  it  mainly 
distributed into the plasma fraction of blood. 
No  or  limited  placenta  transfer  was  observed  in  pregnant  mice,  rabbits,  dogs  and  humans. 
Glycopyrronium and its metabolites distributed well into milk from lactating rats and generally reached 
higher  concentrations  in  milk  when  compared  with  those  observed  in  plasma  (up  to  11.3  times).  Its 
significance to humans is unknown. 
Metabolism 
The in vivo metabolic profile (plasma, urine and faeces) of glycopyrronium was thoroughly investigated 
in  mice  and  rats  following  IV,  PO  and  IT  (only  rats)  administration.  Furthermore,  the  metabolites  in 
milk  (M)  and  bile  (B)  were  investigated  in  lactating  and  bile  duct-cannulated  rats.  Glycopyrronium  is 
extensively metabolised  in  rodents.  There  were  some  quantitative  differences  in  the  metabolic  profile 
in  rodents  depending  on  the  route  of  administration.  The  differences  were  most  pronounced  for  the 
parent  drug  and  the  metabolites  found  in  significant  amounts  in  plasma  (i.e.,  >2%  of  the  total  AUC; 
M8,  M9,  M10,  M16,  M17,  M20,  M38,  M40,  M41  and  M42).  Regardless,  glycopyrronium  and  its 
metabolite  M9  constituted  the  majority  of  the  plasma  exposure  in  mice  and  rats.  Following  PO 
administration,  metabolism  was  the  major  route  of  elimination.  This  is  not  surprising  considering  the 
low bioavailability following PO administration. 
Human  systemic  exposure  to  M9  (CJL603)  was  on  average  in  the  same  order  of  magnitude  as  the 
exposure  to  parent  drug  after  inhalation.  In  humans,  M9  was  only  of  minor  importance  after  IV 
administration.  Moreover,  only  minimal  amounts  of  M9  were  found  in  the  urine  after  both  routes  of 
administration.  
The  in  vitro  metabolism  of  glycopyrronium  was  investigated  in  mouse,  rat  (two  strains),  rabbit,  dog 
and human hepatocytes in addition to liver and lung microsomes obtained from rat, dog and human. 
Quantitative,  but  no  qualitative  differences  were  observed  between  species.  However,  no  unique 
human  metabolites  were  identified  in  vitro.  Clinically,  there  are  no  indications  for  the  existence  of 
unidentified  human  metabolites.  Overall,  it  is  considered  unlikely  that  metabolites  of  glycopyrronium 
contribute significantly to the efficacy or safety of product.    
Only low metabolism was seen when glycopyrronium was incubated with recombinant human CYP2D6 
enzymes.  Furthermore,  the  in  vitro  studies  did  not  show  lung  metabolism  in  the  species  tested  (rat, 
dog and human). 
No  chiral  interconversion  of  QBA608  and  QBA609  was  detected  in  vitro  using  rat,  dog  and  human 
hepatocytes.  However,  the  data  is  difficult  to  assess  as  the  raw  data  or  representative  mass  spectra 
are not available. Furthermore, it is not obvious whether the method of analysis used for studying the 
interconversion was validated. The Lower LoQ has been stated as 1 ng/mL (rat matrix) in the report. 
No  chiral  interconversion  of  QBA608  and  QBA609  was  detected  in  vitro  in  rat  microsomes  using  a 
semi-validated method analysis with a lower LoQ of 5 ng/mL.  
Chiral interconversion was observed in vivo in rats (see Absorption section).

Excretion 
The excretion of glycopyrronium was investigated in mice and rats (including bile duct-cannulated) 
following IT (rat only), IV and PO administration.  
Following IV administration, the glycopyrronium was mainly eliminated via urinary excretion (46-68%) 
and to a lesser extent via bile/faeces (<40%). The radioactivity could mainly be ascribed to unchanged 
drug  in  both  faeces  and  urine  accounting  for  about  50-60%  and  25-65%  of  the  total  detected 
radioactivity, respectively. These data indicate that both the metabolic and biliary elimination are less 
important elimination pathways as compared to the urinary excretion.  
Following IT and PO administration, glycopyrronium was mainly excreted via faeces (>50% and >90%, 
respectively).  It  is  likely  that  the  majority  of  the  swallowed  dose  is  not  absorbed  (and  hence  directly 
excreted in the faeces) considering 1) the low biliary excretion in bile duct-cannulated rats following IV 
administration  (~7%),  2)  the  low  oral  bioavailability  observed  in  rats  and  humans  following  PO 
administration,  and  3)  the  fact  that  the  majority  of  the  radioactivity  in  faeces  from  rodents  could  be 
ascribed to unchanged drug (>60% of the detected radioactivity) following PO administration. 
The  excretion  of  glycopyrronium  was  investigated  in  humans  following  IV  and  IH  administration.  In 
humans,  urinary  excretion  was  the  major  route  of  elimination  (accounting  for  61-85%  of  the  dose). 
Non-renal  clearance  was  mainly  due  to  metabolism  as  limited  biliary  clearance  (approximately  5% 
after  IV  administration)  was  observed.  Furthermore,  no  major  species-differences  in  excretion  were 
identified based on the available data. 
Following inhalation in humans, part of the administrated dose will be distributed to the lung and part 
will  be  swallowed  orally.  However,  the  gastrointestinal  absorption  of  glycopyrronium  is  unlikely  to 
contribute significantly to the total systemic exposure. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
In vitro cytochrome P450 enzyme inhibition  
The potential of NVA237 to inhibit human CYP enzyme activity was assessed using pooled human liver 
microsomes  using  several  probe  substrates  whose  metabolism  is  known  to  be  CYP  enzyme-selective. 
NVA237 showed very weak inhibition of CYP2D6 (IC50=100 μM) and CYP3A4/5-dependent midazolam 
hydroxylation  (IC50≈230  μM  estimated  by  extrapolation  of  experimental  data).  Very  little  or  no 
inhibition of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2E1 and CYP3A4/5-dependent 
testosterone hydroxylation activities was observed at NVA237 concentrations of up to 200 μM.  
In vitro transporter inhibition  
The potential of NVA237 to inhibit human ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter-mediated efflux via 
the  multidrug-resistant  protein  1  (MDR1),  the  breast  cancer  resistant  protein  (MXR,  BCRP)  and  the 
multidrug resistance-associated protein 2 (MRP2) was investigated in recombinant MDCKII cells using 
the  probe  substrates  cyclosporine  A  (for  MDR1),  mitoxantrone  (for  MXR)  and  valsartan  (for  MRP2). 
NVA237 was found to be no inhibitor of MDR1, MXR and MRP2 in all concentrations investigated (i.e., 
up to 300 µM). 
The  potential  of  NVA237  to  inhibit  human  transporter-mediated  uptake  via  the  organic  cation 
transporter  1  (OCT1),  and  the  organic  cation  transporter  2  (OCT2)  was  investigated  in  HEK293  cells 
transiently transfected with OCT1 or OCT2. NVA237 was identified as a substrate for OCT1 and OCT2 
with a Km of 125 μM and 119 μM respectively, and as an inhibitor of OCT1 and OCT2 with IC50 values 
of 47 and 17 µM, respectively. 
The accumulation of [14C]-NVA237 (11.8 µM) into HEK Flp-In cells stably expressing human multidrug 
and toxin extrusion transporters hMATE1 and hMATE2K was investigated in vitro in parental HEK Flp-In

cells.    The  MATE  substrate/inhibitor  tetraethylammonium  (200  μM)  completely  inhibited  hMATE1-
mediated  [14C]-NVA237  transport.  Conversely,  the  uptake  of  [14C]-NVA237  into  HEK  Flp-In  cells 
stably expressing hMATE2K was not higher than the uptake into parental cells. These data suggest that 
NVA237 is a substrate of hMATE1, which may partly explain the renal clearance of NVA237 in humans 
in  vivo.  There  is  a  potential  for  inhibitors  of  hMATE1  to  affect  the  renal  excretion  of  NVA237  and  its 
pharmacokinetics. 
In vitro induction of metabolizing enzymes and transporters in human hepatocytes  
NVA237  was  examined  for  its  potential  to  induce  mRNA  and  activities  of  drug-metabolizing  enzymes 
and  transporters  in  cryopreserved  human  hepatocytes  of  three  individual  donors  after  48  h  of 
treatment.  Induction  of  mRNA,  relative  to  the  vehicle  control,  was  determined  by  real-time  PCR  (RT-
PCR) and evaluation of changes in CYP enzyme activities were assessed after the induction period by 
quantitative  LC/MS/MS  analysis  of  CYP-selective  probe  substrate  metabolism.  NVA237  at 
concentrations  of  up  to  50  nM  was  determined  not  to  be  an  inducer  of  CYP1A2,  CYP2A6,  CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  or  CYP3A4  enzyme  activity  in  hepatocytes.  In  addition,  NVA237  did  not 
induce  CYP1A1,  CYP1A2,  CYP2A6,  CYP2B6,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  CYP3A4,  CYP3A5,  UGT1A1, 
MDR1, or MRP2 mRNA. 
In vitro uptake of NVA237 into human hepatocytes  
The potential active uptake of NVA237 by hepatocytes was studied in 3- to 4-day primary cultures of 
human  hepatocytes.  Hepatic  uptake  was  in  a  low  range  with  human  hepatic  clearance  around  7 
μL/min/mg.  The  data  indicated  human  hepatocyte  uptake  of  NVA237  occurs,  most  likely,  solely  by  a 
slow passive permeation process. 
In vitro intestinal transport in the gastrointestinal Caco-2 cell line  
The  permeability  of  NVA237  across  the  intestinal  barrier  was  investigated  using  the  Caco-2  model 
system.  Based  on  total  radioactivity,  no  substantial  differences  between  apical-to-basolateral  (AP-BL) 
and basolateral-to-apical (BL-AP) permeabilities of NVA237 were observed for all tested concentrations 
(5 - 200 μM). Standard inhibitors of efflux pumps had no significant effect on the AP-BL permeabilities 
of  NVA237.  Further  HPLC  analysis  of  specific  NVA237  samples  revealed  that  only  ~  1  %  of  the 
radioactivity  in  the  receiver  compartment  accounted  for  CJL603,  while  the  major  part  of  radioactivity 
was identified as the parent NVA237. It was concluded that NVA237 permeates passively at a low rate 
through  Caco-2  monolayers  without  involvement  of  drug  transporters.  The  predictive  absorption  was 
less than 30%. 
Concerning the maximum plasma concentration of 0.5 nM for glycopyrronium following administration 
of  the  maximum  recommended  human  dose,  it  is  considered  unlikely  that  glycopyrronium  should 
behave  as  a  victim  or  perpetrator  drug  for  a  broad  panel  of  cytochrome  P450  enzymes  and  various 
transporters  (MDR1,  MXR,  BCRP,  MRP2,  OCT1,  OCT2  and  hMATE2K).  The  only  exception  is  the  renal 
and  hepatic  transporter  hMATE1  for  which  it  cannot  be  excluded  that  inhibitors  may  affect  the 
pharmacokinetics of glycopyrronium. However, the clinical relevance cannot be assessed as the affinity 
of glycopyrronium for hMATE1 is presently not known. 
The in vitro  data also indicated that the disposition of glycopyrronium is mainly mediated via passive 
diffusion.  
Mg-stearate uptake in rat lung precise-cut slices 
Mg-stearate is an excipient used in the dry-powder formulation of Tovanor Breezhaler (daily exposure 
37 µg/day). [3H4]-Mg-stearate was dissolved in culture medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 
incubated with rat lung slices up to 24 hours at 4°C and 37°C. A significant difference in tissue uptake 
(4% versus 43%) was observed between 4°C and 37°C, respectively, suggesting the contribution of an 
Tovanor Breezhaler

Page 20/84
 
 
active  process  involving  transporters  or  others  cell  mechanisms.  No  differences  in  cell  viability  were 
observed  using  an  ATP  bioluminescence  assay,  indicating  that  [3H4]Mg-stearate  is  not  toxic  for  lung 
cells at the tested concentration (4.81 μM [salt] or 10 μM [free acid]) over 24 hours. 
Mg-stearate  is  likely  to  be  dissolved  into  the  lung  surfactant  and  taken  up  into  the  lung  tissue. 
Following cell uptake, stearic acid is assumed to undergo lipid metabolism. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Extensive  data  are  reported  in  the  literature  for  glycopyrronium  bromide  following  single  PO,  intra-
peritoneal  (IP)  or  IV  administrations  to  mice,  rats,  rabbits,  cats  and  dogs.  Single  dose  investigations 
were  also  included  in  dose-range  finding  studies  during  an  IV  cardiovascular  safety  pharmacology 
study in dogs (Study 0510129) and a 1-week inhalation toxicity study in dogs (Study 852240). These 
studies revealed clinical signs that included mydriasis, tachycardia, prostration, anorexia and diarrhoea 
consistent with exaggerated pharmacological effects and, at very high doses, drug-induced deaths. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The results from repeat-dose inhalation toxicity studies conducted in rats and dog are tabulated in the 
table  below.  The  achieved  doses  are  expressed  in  terms  of  the  ammonium  cation  of  glycopyrronium 
bromide.  Moreover,  the  mass  median  aerodynamic  diameters  values  given  in  the  table  are  based  on 
chemical analysis. 
The following parameters were evaluated in the pivotal repeat-dose toxicity study in rats (26-weeks): 
clinical  signs,  body  weights,  food  consumption,  ophthalmology,  haematology,  clinical  biochemistry, 
urinalysis,  toxicokinetics,  gross  observations  at  necropsy,  organ  weights  and  histopathology.  In  the 
pivotal repeat-dose toxicity study in dogs (39-weeks) the following parameters were evaluated: clinical 
signs,  body  weights,  food  consumption,  ophthalmology,  electrocardiography,  respiratory  minute 
volumes,  haematology,  clinical  biochemistry,  urinalysis,  toxicokinetics,  organ  weights  and  gross 
observations at necropsy, histopathology, mask aerosol concentrations and particle size analysis. 
Overview of the repeat-dose toxicity studies conducted with NVA237. The doses are given as glycopyrronium base.

DRF, dose-range finding 
Genomic analysis (Study 0580297)  
The  major  treatment  effect  on  gene  expression  following  NVA237  treatment  of  rats  for  13  and  26-
weeks was a reversible increase in expression of genes related to xenobiotic metabolism (Cyp3a2a) as 
well  as  to  the  bronchial  mucosa.  The  changes  in  mucosa  associated  genes  were  localized  in  the 
terminal  and  respiratory  bronchioles,  corresponding  to  the  site  of  morphological  change  reported  by 
histopathology  (hypertrophy  of  the  bronchioloalveolar  junction).  They  comprised  genes  expressed  by 
associated  to  mucus/Clara  cells.  The  increase  in  mRNA  expression  of  the  mucus/Clara  cells  signature 
was  dose  dependant,  already  visible  after  3  months  of  treatment,  not  stronger  after  6  months  of 
treatment and fully recoverable after 4 weeks of recovery. No signs of inflammation could be detected 
at the molecular level. 
Repeat-dose inhalation toxicity studies were conducted in Wistar rats and Beagle dogs with treatment 
durations  of  up  to  26-  and  39-weeks,  respectively.  The  studies  were  performed  using  dry  powder 
formulations  containing  considerably  higher  levels  of  glycopyrronium  (2-8%),  magnesium  stearate 
(0.25-1%) and lactose monohydrate (91-97.75%)  than applied clinically. Moreover, the applied mass 
median aerodynamic diameters were of a size allowing inhalation into the lung. Generally, the findings 
made could either be ascribed the muscarinic anticholinergic mode of action of glycopyrronium or the 
local  irritation  of  the  airways  caused  by  prolonged  inhalation  exposure.  High  safety  margins  were 
obtained. Hence, the no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) were established in rats and dogs at 
AUC  exposures  at  least  22-fold  and  10-fold  higher,  respectively,  than  is  observed  clinically  at  a 
therapeutic dose of 50 µg/day. 
As  a  result  of  the  pharmacodynamic  action  of  glycopyrronium,  mydriasis,  reduced  excretion  from 
exocrine  glands  and  tachycardia  were  observed  in  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies.  Hence,  dry  oral 
mucosa or gums, reduced lacrimal gland secretions, hypertrophy of the salivary or lacrimal glands and 
mild inflammation, dilation of the ducts and/or alveoli of the sub mucosal glands in the pharynx were 
apparent during the 1-, 4- or 39-week toxicity studies in dogs. Hypertrophy or atrophy of the salivary 
or lacrimal glands were also observed during a 4-week toxicity study in rats whilst increased porphyrin 
deposition  was  recorded  in  the  Harderian  glands  during  4-  and  26-week  toxicity  studies  in  rats. 
Reduced food intake, reduced body weight gain and increased water intake in rats and dry mouth and 
reduced food intake in dogs were most likely caused by the reduced palatability of the diet. Moreover, 
the  red  eyeballs,  red  eye  lids  and  ocular  opacities  observed  in  dogs  are  most  likely  the  result  of  the 
treatment-related reduction in lacrimal gland secretion. 
Tachycardia was recorded in dogs at doses ≥0.077 mg/kg/day which gives rise to an AUC based safety 
margin of 16 to 21-fold in male and female dogs, respectively). This finding is most likely the results of

an  exaggerated  pharmacodynamic  effect  on  the  cardiovascular  system  since  glycopyrronium  will 
reduce the parasympathetic effect on the heart. 
Changes in the respiratory tract were evident at all dose levels in the rat repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
The changes in the larynx consisted of squamous  metaplasia, hyperplasia and keratosis accompanied 
by  inflammation  in  the  sub  mucosa  which  was  necrotizing  in  males  exposed  to  1.3  mg/kg/day  for  4-
weeks.  Moreover,  hyaline  inclusions  and  degeneration  of  the  olfactory  respiratory  epithelium  were 
observed. Based on gene expression analysis, the epithelial hypertrophy noted at the bronchiolalveolar 
junction  appears  to  be  correlated  with  Clara  cells.  Similar  findings  were  not  made  in  the  respiratory 
tract of dogs. The innate sensitivity of the upper respiratory tract of rodents to the pathologic effects of 
inhaled  compounds  is  a  well-recognized  phenomenon  and  is  probably  related  to  differences  in  airflow 
dynamics  as  well  as  regional  epithelial  sensitivity  in  comparison  with  non-rodents  and  humans. 
Moreover,  taking  the  estimated  deposited  mass  and  lung  weight  into  consideration,  the  local  lung 
exposure at the NOAELs established in the rat studies were 24 to 194-fold higher than that anticipated 
in humans at the proposed therapeutic dose. Hence, the observed changes in the respiratory tract of 
rats do not represent a clinical risk. 
Cases  of  glycopyrronium  contamination  of  plasma  samples  collected  from  control  animals  were 
observed  in  the  pivotal  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  (0580297,  0670548)  as  well  as  in  the 
carcinogenicity  studies  (0670435,  0770668),  the  study  on  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development 
(0870596)  and  the  study  on  embryo-foetal  development  rabbits  (0870597).  However,  due  to  the 
relatively low incidence and the low level of contamination (representing up to 27% of the Cmax in the 
lowest  dose  group),  it  is  considered  unlikely  that  these  findings  would  impact  the  validity  of  the 
studies.

On  comparison  of  each  of  the  three  control  groups,  both  individually  and  combined,  to  the  three 
treated  groups  by  Peto  Trend  test  for  endometrial  stromal  polyp  and  the  combination  of  endometrial 
stromal  polyp  plus  endometrial  stromal  sarcoma,  no  statistically  significant  increases  were  observed 
except  for  endometrial  stromal  polyp  when  one  of  three  control  groups  (air  control  group  2)  was 
compared to the treated groups. When pair wise comparisons were made for the same data sets, none 
of  the  groups  showed  any  statistical  significance.  Based  on  these  statistical  results,  none  of  these 
variations  in  the  incidences  of  endometrial  stromal  polyp  and  endometrial  stromal  polyp  plus 
endometrial  stromal  sarcoma  were  considered  to  be  treatment  related.  Further  examination  of  the 
actual incidences of endometrial tumours against background data generated for control animals from 
comparable carcinogenicity studies using the same strain of animals in the same laboratory indicated 
that  the  spontaneous  incidence  varies  from  6%  to  11.6%  with  a  mean  of  8.43%.  In  this  study,  the 
spontaneous  incidences  in  the  control  groups  were  2%,  4%  and  12%,  for  which  2%  and  4%  were 
deemed to be atypically low. 
At week 52, the mean plasma AUC0-24 values were 8.2, 22.2 and 36.5 ng.h/mL in the low, mid and 
high-dose  group,  respectively.  Similarly,  the  mean  C max  values  were  2.1,  5.7  and  11.9  ng/mL  in  the 
low, mid and high-dose group, respectively.

All samples from control groups were analyzed and no concentrations above LLOQ (0.100 ng/mL) were 
measured in samples from air control group 2 and vehicle control group 3. Three out 21 samples of the 
air control group 1 had concentrations above LLOQ. These concentrations ranged from 0.333 to 0.974 
ng/mL and represent less than 17% on day 1 and about 43% in week 52 of the corresponding mean 
C max  of  the  low  dose.  This  was  considered  to  have  had  no  impact  on  the  interpretation  of  the 
toxicokinetic analyses or conclusions. 
No  treatment-related  neoplastic  findings  were  identified  in  a  104-week  rat  inhalation  carcinogenicity 
study  at  glycopyrronium  plasma  exposure  levels  of  up  to  79-fold  higher  than  is  observed  in  patients 
inhaling  50  µg/day.  In  the  uterus,  imbalances  in  the  incidence  of  benign  endometrial  polyps  were 
recorded  between  control  and  treated  groups.  However,  the  slightly  increased  incidence  of  benign 
endometrial  polyps  observed  at  the  highest  dose  level  did  not  exceed  the  range  of  historical  control 
incidences  and  further  statistical  analysis  demonstrated  that  the  increase  in  incidence  was  not 
statistically  significant.  Altogether,  the  slightly  increased  incidence  of  benign  endometrial  polyps  is 
most likely of no clinical relevance. 
Short or medium-term studies 
An overview of the 26-week carcinogenicity study in wild-type and CByB6F1-Tg (HRAS)2Jic transgenic 
mice  is  given  in  the  table  below.  Glycopyrronium  bromide  was  formulated  in  deionized  water  for  oral 
administration.  A  positive  control  group  was  applied  which  received  a  single IP  injection  of  75  mg/kg 
N-methyl-N-nitrosourea  (MNU)  on  study  day  1.  As  expected,  the  MNU-treated  transgenic  mice 
developed  multicentric  lymphoma  and  an  increased  incidence  of  neoplastic  changes  in  a  variety  of 
tissues  in  both  sexes.  However,  NVA237  treatment  neither  increased  the  incidence  of  neoplastic 
findings in transgenic mice nor in wild-type mice.

NVA237 was not quantifiable in plasma for many animals at the doses of 10, 25, and 30 mg/kg/day as 
the  concentrations  were  below  the  LLOQ  of  0.100  ng/mL.  However,  according  to  the  measured 
concentrations  of  the  NVA237  metabolite  CJL603  in  plasma,  all  animals  received  NVA237.  For 
unchanged NVA237, toxicokinetic parameters were only determined at doses of 75 mg/kg/day (male) 
and  100  mg/kg/day  (female)  due  to  the  few  quantifiable  data  points  at  lower  doses.  For  CJL603 
toxicokinetic parameters were determined at all dose levels. 
None of the control specimens contained measurable concentration of NVA237. The metabolite CJL603 
was  detected  in  two  control  samples  at  concentrations  of  0.321  ng/mL  and  1.83  ng/mL  respectively. 
The  two  concentrations  obtained  in  the  control  animals  represented  only  0.03%  and  0.15%  of  the 
mean Cmax obtained in the low dose female group and, therefore, do not impact the interpretation of 
the toxicokinetic results. 
In  a  26-week  oral  carcinogenicity  study,  glycopyrronium  treatment  did  not  increase  the  incidence  of 
neoplastic findings in CByB6F1-Tg (HRAS)2Jic transgenic mice at plasma exposure levels (AUC) up to 
50-fold higher than is observed in patients receiving the recommended daily dose.

The  MMAD  values  obtained  in  the  pivotal  inhalation  studies  varied  from  1.7  to  2.9  µm  hence  the 
particle  sizes  were  respirable  to  rats.  Moreover,  the  test  article  applied  in  the  inhalation  studies 
consisted  of  8%  NVA237  salt  form,  1%  magnesium  stearate  and  91%  lactose  monohydrate.  The

No effects on male rat fertility parameters (including sperm counts and sperm motility) were noted at 
plasma  exposure  levels  (AUC)  up  to  895-fold  higher  than  is  observed  clinically  at  therapeutic  doses. 
Decreases in the number of corpora lutea and implantation sites were observed females with a NOAEL 
of 0.5 mg/kg/day. This gives rise to an AUC based safety margin of approximately 160-fold. Overall, it 
is  considered  unlikely  that  treatment  with  NVA237  will  affect  fertility  in  humans  at  therapeutic  doses 
(50 µg daily).  
No  effects  on  embryo-foetal  development  were  observed  in  pregnant  rats  exposed  to  glycopyrronium 
via  inhalation  during  gestation  days  6  to  17  and  in  pregnant  rabbits  inhaling  glycopyrronium  during 
gestation days 7 through 19. The maximal plasma exposures (AUC) achieved in the pregnant rats and 
rabbits  were  around  670-  and  250-fold  higher  than  is  observed  in  humans  at  the  maximal 
recommended daily dose. Furthermore, it should be underlined that glycopyrronium is unlikely to have 
reached  significant  concentrations  in  the  foetuses.  Nevertheless,  this  also  seems  to  be  the  case  in 
humans. 
Pre-  and  postnatal  development  was  not  affected  in  a  study  applying  SC  glycopyrronium  dosing  of 
pregnant rats. Toxicokinetic evaluations were not performed however based on the data from the rat 
SC fertility study; it is likely that the plasma exposure was at least 100-fold higher than is observed in 
humans at the recommended daily dose.

a, AUC 0-8 h ; b, AUC 0-6.5 h  ; the doses marked with bold represent the NOAEL; exposure multiples are based on 50 
µg, multiple dose [Study CNVA237A2103]; C max = 0.166 ng/mL; AUC 0-24h = 0.464 ng·h/mL 
During the toxiciokinetic analysis performed as part of the pivotal 26-week repeat-dose toxicity study 
in rats (0580297), NVA237 was detected in two air control animals (animal number 1543 and 1544). 
The  measured  levels  were  0.163  and  0.348  ng/mL  which  represent  concentrations  12-  and  6-fold 
below  the  Cmax  at  the  lowest  dose  level  (0.09  mg/kg).  Due  to  the  low  level  of  contamination,  it  is 
considered unlikely that this finding would impact the validity of the study.

Similarly,  in  the  pivotal  39-week  dog  study  (0670548),  NVA237  concentrations  above  LLOQ  (0.100 
ng/mL) were measured in 4 out of 300 samples collected from air control animals in week 26 and week 
39  (concentrations  within  the  range  0.120  ng/mL  to  5.99  ng/mL).  Moreover,  NVA237  concentrations 
above LLOQ (0.100 ng/mL) were measured in 9 out of 300 vehicle control samples in day 28, week 26 
and  week  39  samples  (concentrations  within  the  range  0.103  ng/mL  to  0.727  ng/mL).  Since  the 
measured concentrations are close to LLOQ (except in dog 104) and the concentrations in other time 
points  samples  of  the  same  animal  were  measured  below  the  LLOQ,  this  is  considered  of  having  no 
impact on the interpretation of the TK analysis and conclusions. 
Local Tolerance  
Local  tolerance  in  the  respiratory  tract  was  evaluated  during  the  rat  and  dog  repeated  dose  toxicity 
studies that were performed by inhalation administration.  
NVA237 (0.2%, 2.4%, 24% (w/v)) was not identified as a sensitizer in the murine Balb/c local lymph 
node assay (study 0670690, GLP). Local toxicity was observed at the highest dose tested in the form 
of  reddening  of  the  application  site  (ear  skin)  from  the  second  day  of  application  and  an  increase  in 
draining lymph node weights but there was no associated lymph node hypercellularity. 
Other toxicity studies 
Immunotoxicity 
Standard  toxicology  studies  did  not  reveal  any  adverse  effects  on  the  immune  organs.  Immune 
function assessments during a 4-week inhalation toxicity study in rats (Study 848192) confirmed that 
there  were  no  changes  in  leukocyte  distribution  or  on  the  primary  immune  response  to  sheep 
erythrocytes. The lack of immunotoxicity testing was considered acceptable. 
Dependence 
Preclinical  and  clinical  studies  did  not  indicate  any  potential  for  dependence.  Specific  investigations 
were therefore not conducted which was considered acceptable. 
Metabolites 
No  toxicity  studies  were  performed  with  NVA237  metabolites.  Based  on  the  pharmacokinetic  data 
provided, this was considered acceptable. 
Studies on impurities 
There  are  no  drug  substance  impurities  in  glycopyrronium  bromide  used  in  the  NVA237  clinical 
formulations  that  exceeded  the  threshold  for  toxicological  qualification.  The  presence  of  methyl 
bromide  and  the  intermediate  NVA237-B3  (544-05)  in  the  drug  substance  are  tested  and  controlled 
according to set specifications. Methyl bromide is Ames test positive. It was found at levels below 10 
ppm  in  14  development  batches  and  the  first  4  launch  batches  of  drug  substance.  This  level  would 
result  in  a  maximum  daily  intake  0.5  ng/day  methyl  bromide  which  is  far  below  the  threshold  for 
Toxicological  Concern  of  1.5  µg/day.  The  intermediate  544-05  is  reported  to  have  hallucinogenic 
effects  at  oral  doses  of  2  to  4  mg.  It  is  limited  as  an  unspecified  impurity  to  ≤0.10%,  which 
corresponds to a maximum daily intake of ≤0.05 µg/day for a daily dose of 50 µg or 40000 times less 
than the dose reported to have a hallucinogenic effect.  
The  NVA237  formulation  degradation  product,  cyclopentylmandelic  acid  (CPMA)  and  its  counterpart 
542-07  were  qualified  in  genotoxicity  assays  and  a  4-week  repeated  dose  inhalation  toxicity  study  in 
rats.    A  batch  of  NVA237  (glycopyrronium  bromide)  spiked  with  10.8%  CPMA  and  8%  542-07  was 
negative in Ames and chromosome aberration tests.

The toxicological profile of NVA237 and NVA237 spiked with degradation products were compared in a 
28-day  inhalation  qualification  study  in  Wistar  rats  (10/sex/group).  The  following  parameters  were 
evaluated: clinical  signs,  body  weights,  food  consumption, ophthalmology,  haematology,  clinical  
chemistry,  urinalysis,   toxicokinetics    (week  4), gross  observations  at  necropsy  for  all groups,  organ 
weights  and  histopathology.  Although  the  aim  was  to  have  0.6  mg/kg/day  as  the  highest  dose,  the 
achieved  dose  levels  were  0.16  (spiked),  0.48  (spiked)  and  0.7  (pure)  mg/kg/day.  The  body  weight 
gain  and  food  consumption  were  decreased  in  males  receiving  spiked  0.48  mg/kg/day  and  0.7 
mg/kg/day  (pure).  Moreover,  a  decrease  in  body  weight  gain  was  noted  in  spiked  0.48  mg/kg/day 
females.  Both  treatment  caused  an  in  creased  number  of  goblet  cells  in  the  nasal  cavity.  However, 
erosion of the respiratory/olfactory epithelium and haemorrhage was only observed in the 0.48 spiked 
group with an incidence of 2/10 and  1/10, respectively. Still, these findings were not made in any of 
the females. On study day 28, the obtained plasma exposure levels (AUC0-24h) were 12.2, 43.6 and 
71.1  ng*h/mL  in  males  exposed  to  0.16  (spiked),  0.48  (spiked)  and  0.7  (pure)  mg/kg/day  while  the 
corresponding AUC values in females were 9.36, 39.1 and 58.3 ng*h/mL. 
Other studies 
Formulation excipients 
Oral  inhalation  studies  conducted  with  magnesium  stearate  alone  or  a  blend  of  1%  magnesium 
stearate  in  lactose  in  Wistar  rats  up  to  26  weeks  or  Beagle  dogs  up  to  52  weeks  revealed  no 
toxicological or local respiratory tract tolerance issues.  
Combination studies with indacaterol 
NVA237  inhalation  toxicity  studies  performed  in  combination  with  the  beta-2  adrenergic  agonist 
indacaterol (QAB149, Onbrez Breezhaler) comprised 2-week studies in rats and dogs (Study 0670546), 
(Study  0670547)  as  well  as  a  13-week  study  in  dogs  (Study  0670756)  and  an  embryo  foetal 
development study in rats (Study 0670755). No findings were made in the combination embryo-foetal 
study  in  rats.  The  findings  seen  in  the  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  were  similar  to  those  observed  in 
the studies performed with NVA237 and indacaterol alone. There were some indications of a synergistic 
effect  on  heart  rate  in  female  dogs.  Heart  rate  increases  of  36  and  22%  were  observed  30  minutes 
following inhalation of NVA237 (0.128 mg/kg) and indacaterol (0.37 mg/kg), respectively, whereas the 
combination of the two increased the heart rate by 51%. However, no synergistic effect on heart rate 
was observed in male dogs. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  predicted  environmental  concentration  (PEC)  was  estimated  to  0.00025  µg/L  using  the  default 
value  for  the  Fpen  and  a  daily  dose  of  50  µg.  Due  to  the  very  low  maximum  daily  dose  of  50  μg  of 
active  pharmaceutical  ingredient,  intake  of  glycopyrronium  bromide  into  the  environment  through 
patients use is low and the predicted environmental concentration remains well below the trigger level 
for a Phase II environmental risk assessment. 
Screening  for  persistence,  bioaccumulation  and  toxicity  (PBT)  is  not  deemed  necessary  for 
glycopyrronium  bromide,  as  judged  from  the  octanol-water  partition  coefficient  (logKow)  of  -2.1, 
determined for this drug substance.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Based on in vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamic data, there is a clear rationale for the development of 
glycopyrronium in COPD. Safety pharmacology studies revealed no risk for effects on the core organs 
at  clinically  relevant  glycopyrronium  exposure  levels.  Based  on  pharmacokinetic  data  on  absorption, 
metabolism  and  excretion,  mice  and  rats  are  valid  animal  models.  Overall,  the  findings  made  in  the 
repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  could  either  be  ascribed  the  muscarinic  anticholinergic  mode  of  action  of 
glycopyrronium  or  the  local  irritation  of  the  airways  caused  by  prolonged  inhalation  exposure.  High 
safety margins were obtained. Hence, the no observed adverse effect levels (NOAELs) were established 
in rats and dogs at AUC exposures at least 22-fold and 10-fold higher, respectively, than is observed 
clinically at a therapeutic dose of 50 µg/day. Glycopyrronium was demonstrated to be non-genotoxic in 
a  standard  battery  of  tests  and  non-carcinogenic  in  a  104-week  inhalation  study  in  rats  and  in  a  26-
week study in HRAS transgenic mice. Furthermore, glycopyrronium did not cause significant effects on 
fertility, embryo-foetal development or pre- and post-natal development. A reduction in corpora lutea 
and implantation sites were observed in the female fertility study while a reduction in pup weight was 
seen in the pre- and post-natal study however in both cases, the findings occurred with a more than 
100-fold safety margin.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A  full  comprehensive  non-clinical  programme  was  conducted  to  support  the  clinical  program.  From  a 
non-clinical  point  of  view,  there  were  no  issues  identified  to  be  followed  up  as  post-authorisation 
measures.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
  Bioavailability 
Study  A2108  was  a  randomized,  partly  double-blind,  two-part,  study  to  determine  the  absolute,  oral 
and inhaled bioavailability of NVA237. 
Upon pulmonal administration, NVA237 is readily absorbed with Tmax values around 5 minutes. Mean 
steady  state  Cmax  and  AUC0-24h  values  following  14  days  treatment  with  50  ug  NVA237  was  166 
pg/mL and 464 pg*h/mL. Following repeated once-daily inhalation of NVA237 by patients with COPD, 
steady-state concentrations were reached within one week of treatment. 
Bioavailability studies demonstrated that charcoal blocks absorption of orally administered NVA237. No 
difference  in  the  time-concentration  profile  was  detectable  between  pulmonal  administration  with  or

without  concomitant  administration  of  charcoal.  Absolute  bioavailability  based  on  AUCinf  values  was 
about  42%  following  inhalation  of  200  ug  by  the  Concept1  device.  AUCinf  values  were  obtainable  in 
12/18 subjects; estimates based on AUClast were lower (32%). This is likely an underestimation due 
to substantial differences in elimination half-life upon i.v. and pulmonal administration. 
Distribution 
In vitro blood distribution and plasma protein binding of NVA237 were studied in animals and humans. 
Distribution  to  red  blood  cells  was  minor  in  all  species.  The  NVA237  fractions  in  plasma  were 
independent  of  the  concentration  (10  to  10’000  ng/mL)  and  were  approximately  99%  in  humans.  At 
concentrations of 1 to10 ng/mL, protein binding was between 38% and 41%. 
After i.v. dosing, the steady-state volume of distribution (Vss) of NVA237 was 83 L and the volume of 
distribution in the terminal phase (Vz) was 376 L. The apparent volume of distribution in the terminal 
phase  following  inhalation  (Vz/F)  was  7310  L,  which  reflects  the  much  slower  elimination  after 
inhalation. 
Elimination 
NVA237  disappears  from  the  systemic  circulation  in  a  multi-phasic  manner.  After  inhalation,  the 
apparent terminal half-life (T1/2) values differed to some extent between studies with means between 
13.0 h and 57.2 h. Values around 20 h were obtained in Study A2103 where sampling was limited to 
24 or 48 h after dosing. In studies A2105, A2108 and A2109, with PK sampling up to 72 or 96 h after 
inhalation and using the most sensitive analytical method, mean T1/2 values varied between 32.5 and 
57.2 h in healthy volunteers after single inhaled doses of 100 or 200 μg. Using the single and repeated 
dose data from Study A2103 the effective half-life was calculated from the accumulation of NVA237 at 
steady state. Mean values of 16 and 22 h were obtained for the effective half-life. 
Renal  elimination  of  unchanged  NVA237  accounts  for  about  60-70%  of  the  total  clearance  of 
systemically available NVA237, while other elimination routes accounts for about 30-40%. Mean CLr of 
NVA237 was between 17.4 and 24.4 L/h. CLr is about 2-3 times higher than the reference value of the 
glomerular filtration rate, and active tubular secretion by MATE1 and OCT2 is contributing to the renal 
elimination of NVA237. 
About 10% of systemic exposure is due to NVA237 being swallowed. Oral bioavailability of NVA237 is 
5%. The M9 metabolite was found in similar amounts as unchanged drug in plasma after inhalation but 
not after intravenous administration. This metabolite is likely formed from swallowed NVA237, and has 
been demonstrated inactive against all targets tested in vitro. Biliary excretion contributes about 5% to 
total  clearance,  while  the  remaining  non-renal  elimination  is  mediated  through  CYP  oxidation, 
glucuronidation/sulfation and hydrolysis.  
In  vitro  data  suggest  that  several  P450  enzymes  contribute  to  the  oxidative  metabolism  of  NVA237, 
the likely most quantitatively important enzyme being CYP2D6. The circulating M9 metabolite is most 
likely  formed  by  cholinesterase  and  origins  from  proportion  of  swallowed  NVA237  upon  inhalation. 
About  30-40%  of  systemic  available  NVA237  is  subject  to  metabolism.  No  specific  data  on  CYP2D6 
genotypes  are  available  from  the  clinical  trials  performed.  Based  on  a  simulation  of  PK  in  subjects 
devoid  of  hepatic  function,  an  estimated  increase  in  AUC  exposure  of  about  1.5-fold  represents  this 
worst-case scenario. This would represent a less likely extreme situation, and it appears unlikely that 
this  exposure  be  of  clinically  relevance  given  the  lack  of  an  apparent  plasma  concentration-adverse 
event association.

Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In study CNVA237A2104, healthy Caucasian and Japanese volunteers received single inhaled doses of 
50,  100  and  200  μg  NVA237  in  a  crossover  design  in  each  ethnic  group.  In  Study  A2103,  parallel 
groups of patients with COPD received repeated once daily doses of 25, 50, 100 and 200 μg of NVA237 
for 14 days. 
Dose  proportionality  with  respect  to  systemic  exposure  was  sufficiently  demonstrated  in  healthy 
Caucasian  and  Japanese  subjects.  Dose  proportionality  appears  demonstrated  in  patients  with  COPD. 
The  PK  of  NVA237  were  time  independent  upon  repeated  administration  of  NVA237.  Accumulation 
ratios for AUC were about 1.44 and 1.69 at 100 and 200ug, respectively. The degree of accumulation 
is  modest  and  given  a  lack  of  an  apparent  relation  between  exposure  and  adverse  events  this  is 
unlikely to be of clinical relevance. 
Special populations 
Two population PK analyses were conducted by the applicant: one which included data from one phase 
2  study  (A2103)  and  two  phase  3  studies  (A2303  and  A2304)  in  COPD  patients  and  a  second  one 
which  included  data  from  the  phase  2  study  in  COPD  patients  (A2103)  and  a  study  of  the  drug  in 
volunteers with renal impairment. There appeared to be a few discrepancies between the results of the 
two modeling exercises and between the results of the modeling and findings from other analyses.  For 
example,  age  (independent  of  renal  function)  and  not  renal  function  was  found  to  be  an  important 
determinant of drug exposure in COPD patients, while in the analysis in renal impairment subjects and 
phase  2  data  from  COPD  patients,  renal  function  was  found  to  be  important.  However,  since  the 
pharmacokinetics of NVA237 for this application mainly is of importance for safety and tolerability, and 
since this profile is relatively benign, this issue was not considered significant. While no specific data is 
available  in  hepatically  impaired  patients,  a  clinical  significant  change  in  NVA237  exposure  due  to 
impaired  hepatic  function  appeared  less  likely  as  renal  excretion  accounts  for  about  60-70%  of  total 
clearance. 
Data  from  a  study  in  patients  with  varying  degrees  of  renal  impairment  and  a  population  PK  model 
including  data  from  this  specific  study  and  PK  data  from  a  study  in  COPD  patients  that  included 
subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment appeared consistent. The Applicant concluded that a 
50 μg dose is safe in subjects with mild and moderate renal impairment and this was endorsed by the 
CHMP. 
While  no  specific  data  is  available,  a  clinical  significant  change  in  NVA237  exposure  due  to  impaired 
hepatic function appears less likely as renal excretion accounts for about 60-70% of total clearance. 
Gender had no apparent effect on NVA237 PK. 
An  increased  exposure  in  terms  of  AUClast  and  Cmax  of  about  40%  and  80%,  respectively,  is 
demonstrated  in  Japanese  healthy  subjects  as  compared  to  Caucasian  healthy  subject.  There  is  no 
obvious biological plausible explanation for this difference. 
By  population  PK  analysis,  AUC  exposure  at  steady  state  was  related  to  body  weight.  With  a  body 
weight below 50 kg, exposure is estimated to increases with about 44%. 
Median  steady  state  AUCtau  of  NVA237  increased  by  70%  between  COPD  patients  of  age  40  to  <45 
years and 75 to 80 years. When taking patients of age 60 to <65 years as reference, median AUCtau 
was 27% higher in patients of age 75 to 80 years, and 25% lower in patients of age 40 to <45 years. 
These differences are unlikely to be of clinical relevance. 
No studies were performed in children.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro 
In  vitro  inhibition  studies  demonstrated  that  NVA237  has  little  inhibition  potential  against  CYP1A2, 
CYP2A6,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  CYP2D6,  CYP2E1  or  CYP3A4/5,  the  ATP-binding  cassette  (ABC) 
efflux  transporters  MDR1,  MRP2  or  MXR,  and  the  solute-carrier  (SLC)  uptake  transporters  OCT1  or 
OCT2. All IC50 or Ki values were substantially higher than the therapeutic Cmax,ss (> 10’000-fold) as 
well as the estimated Cgut (≥ 20-fold).  
In  vitro  enzyme  induction  studies  in  primary  human  hepatocytes  suggested  that  a  clinically  relevant 
induction  by  NVA237  for  of  all  the  enzymes  and  transporter  tested  (CYP1A1,  CYP1A2,  CYP2A6, 
CYP2B6,  CYP2C8,  CYP2C9,  CYP2C19,  CYP3A4,  CYP3A5,  UGT1A1,  MDR1  and  MRP2)  is  unlikely.  All 
mRNA  as  well  as  activity  data  suggest  that  there  would  be  no  clinically  relevant  induction  for  all  the 
enzymes and transporter tested. 
In vivo 
OCT2 and MATE 
NVA237 is a substrate for the cationic SLC transporter OCT2 (organic cation transporter 2) and MATE1 
(multidrug  and  toxin  extrusion  protein).  Study  CNVA237A2109  was  performed  to  assess  the  clinical 
significance of  inhibition of  OTC21  and  MATE1  using  cimetidine  as  a  model  inhibitor.  It  was  an  open-
label, two-period, crossover study in 20 healthy subjects. 
Treatment A (single inhaled dose of NVA237 100 μg) and Treatment B (cimetidine 800 mg b.i.d. for 6 
days  plus  a  single  inhaled  dose  of  NVA237  100  μg  on  the  fourth  day)  were  given  in  a  two-sequence 
crossover fashion, separated by a washout period of 7 to 10 days.  Cimetidine increased total exposure 
(AUClast) to NVA237 by 22% and decreased renal clearance by 23%.  
NVA237 and indacaterol 
Two separate studies in the development of a different medicinal product allows for a quantification of 
estimation  of  an  interaction  between  NVA  and  indacaterol  administered  by  the  Concept1  device.  The 
free combination of inhaled NVA237 and inhaled indacaterol maleate, a long-acting beta-2- adrenergic 
agonist,  was  compared  with  inhalation  of  each  drug  alone.  Study  A2101  was  a  single  dose  study 
comparing  NVA237  doses  of  100  μg  and  indacaterol  doses  of  300  μg.  Study  A2106  was  a  14  day 
repeated dose study comparing NVA237 doses of 50 μg o.d. and indacaterol doses of 150 μg o.d. on 
Day 14 under steady state conditions of both drugs. In the free combination treatments NVA237 was 
inhaled  first,  followed  by  indacaterol.  The  data  showed  that  concomitant  pulmonal  administration  of 
indacaterol does not influence the PK of NVA237. 
Based on in vitro studies, the interaction potential of NVA237 appears low. NVA237 does not inhibit or 
induce drug metabolising enzymes or drug transporters to any meaningful degree. Inhibition of MATE1 
and OTC2 by high-dose cimetidine administration increases AUC exposure by 22%, likely by a similar 
reduction  in  renal  clearance,  with  no  detectable  effect  on  Cmax.  This  is  unlikely  to  be  of  clinical 
relevance. Concomitant pulmonal administration of indacaterol does not influence the PK of NVA237.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Parasympathetic  nerves  are  the  major  bronchoconstrictor  neural  pathway  in  airways,  and  cholinergic 
tone  is  the  major  reversible  component  in  COPD.  Stimulation  of  these  nerves  results  in  release  of 
acetylcholine  (ACh)  that  acts  at  multiple  muscarinic  receptor  subtypes.  Of  the  five  known  muscarinic 
receptor subtypes (M1-5), subtypes M1-3 are of relevance in the human lung. 
NVA237  is  a  highly  potent  muscarinic  receptor  antagonist  of  these  three  receptor  subtypes.  It 
demonstrated  on  average  4-  to  5-fold  selectivity  for  the  human  M3  and  M1  over  the  human  M2 
receptor  in  competition  binding  studies.  This  selectivity  assessment  is  based  on  apparent  binding 
affinity  constants  (pKi  values)  of  9.60  to  9.81  for  M1,  8.70  to  9.25  for  M2  and  9.47  to  9.64  for  M3 
(mean data from three studies). In addition, NVA237 showed faster dissociation form the M2 receptor 
over  the  M1  and  M3  receptors.  The  kinetic  selectivity  (dissociation  rates  form  M2  over  M3  receptors) 
was 9-fold for NVA237 compared to 4-fold for tiotropium. In vitro binding kinetics of NVA237 indirectly 
suggest  that  at  equi-effective  concentrations,  NVA237  will  reach  equilibrium  faster  than  tiotropium, 
and  suggest  a  more  rapid  onset  of  action.  This  was  confirmed  in  clinical  phase  II  and  III  studies. 
Muscarinic  agonist-induced  bronchoconstriction  was  markedly  reduced  by  intratracheal  installation  of 
GP  in  rats  and  this  effect  was  maintained  24  h  post-dose,  although  the  potency  of  GP  slightly 
decreased over this time period.  
Primary pharmacology 
Bronchodilator  effects  of  anticholinergic  drugs  are  commonly  quantified  using  spirometric  endpoints. 
The  most  widely  used  and  accepted  parameter  is  FEV1  as  it  has  the  advantage  of  being  the  most 
repeatable lung function parameter and one that measures changes in both obstructive and restrictive 
types of lung disease. Trough FEV1 was used as the primary efficacy measure in the primary PD studies 
and throughout the Phase II/III efficacy studies in the NVA237 development. Trough FEV 1 was defined 
as  the  mean  of  FEV1  measurements  at  23  h  15  min  and  23  h  45  min  post  morning  dose.  All  studies 
were  placebo-controlled,  A2205  including  tiotropium  as  active  comparator.  A  cross-over  design  was 
chosen  in  A2205,  A2207  and  A2208  as  within-patient  variability  in  FEV 1  is  less  than  between-patient 
variability  in  this  patient  population.  The  wash-out  periods  seem  appropriate  (A2205/A2208:  7  days, 
A2207:  7-14  days).  Reversibility  was  generally  high.  This  will  be  discussed  further  in  the  section  of 
Clinical Efficacy. 
Study A2205 
The  study  was  a  phase  II  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multicenter,  multidose  (7 
days), 6 treatment, 4 period incomplete block cross-over study to compare the efficacy of 4 doses of 
NVA237  (12.5,  25,  50  and  100  µg  once  daily)  with  18  µg  tiotropium  as  active  comparator  in  83 
patients  with  stable  COPD  (25  Japanese  and  58  caucasian).  A  difference  from  placebo  of  0.120  L  in 
trough FEV1 was considered to be the minimally clinically important difference for COPD patients. 
The  primary  efficacy  analysis  was  based  on  the  following  ANCOVA  model:  Trough  FEV1  at  day  7  = 
patient effect + treatment effect + period effect + (period) baseline FEV1 + error. Patients receiving at 
least one study medication were included in the modified intention to treat population (mITT). Baseline 
characteristics  between  the  Japanese  and  non-japanese  population  was  comparable,  though  the 
Japanese population was male and older with 88% being older than 65 years compared to 38% in the 
non-japanese population. 5 of 83 patients discontinued the study, 3 due to adverse events and 2 due 
to withdrawn consent. 80% of the patients received COPD related medication. The Japanese population 
Tovanor Breezhaler

Page 39/84
 
 
were only treated with long acting medications, whereas the non-japanese population was treated with 
both short- and long acting medications. 
Treatment  with  NVA237  resulted  in  a  dose-related  increase  in  FEV1  values  beginning  5  minutes  after 
inhalation of the study drug.  
The primary endpoint, trough value of FEV1 at day 7, was comparable to tiotropium 18 µg. The trough 
FEV 1 was higher than placebo for all strengths as well as for tiotropium, ranging from 0.08, 0.09, 0.13 
and  0.14  L  for  12.5,  25,  50  and  100  µg  NVA237  respectively  and  0.13  L  for  18  µg  tiotropium.  The 
difference was statistically significant.  
The study showed that 50 µg once daily was efficacious and safe. Reversibility is generally above 12%. 
The FEV 1 /FVC is below 0.70 as recommended in guidelines (CPMP/EWP/562/98/Rev.1). 
Study A2205 showed a clear dose-response relationship in the range from NVA237 12.5 µg to 100 µg 
once daily on trough FEV1. The doses of 50 µg and 100 µg of NVA237 had comparable effect on trough 
FEV 1 to tiotropium 18µg once daily. NVA237 100 µg once daily did not offer significant advantage over 
NVA237 50 µg once daily. 
Study A2206 
Study A2206 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, multi-center study, to 
assess  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  28  days  treatment  with  NVA237  (100  or  200  μg  once  a  day)  in 
patients  with  moderate  to  severe  Chronic  Obstructive  Pulmonary  Disease  (COPD).  Even  though  the 
efficacy  assessment  was  a  secondary  parameter,  it  was  shown  that  the  200  µg  dose  only  offered 
marginal better effect on FEV1 than 100 µg. No safety issues were identified. Study A2206 showed that 
NVA237 100 µg and NVA237 200 µg q.d. were safe and well tolerated. 
Study A2207 
Study  A2207  was  a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multi-center,  two-period  crossover 
study  to  investigate  the  bronchodilatory  effect  of  50μg  NVA237  inhaled  once  daily  in  patients  with 
Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).  
It was a supportive pharmacodynamic study performed corroborating the once daily dosing in terms of 
demonstrating  a  sustained  effect  through  24  hours.  Concomitant  medication  was  permitted  in  the 
study as long as this remained stable throughout the study. The medications that were allowed were: 
cromoglycate,  nedocromil,  ketotifen  in  recommended  and  constant  doses  and  dose  regimens.  A 
difference from placebo of 0.120 L in trough FEV 1 was considered to be the minimal important clinical 
difference for COPD patients. In comparison in Study A2205 the difference of the trough value of FEV1 
at day 7 was 0.13 L. 
Study  A2207  showed  that  NVA237  50  µg  q.d.  was  significantly  better  than  placebo,  with  an 
improvement in trough FEV 1 after 14 days treatment of 0.154 L. The 24h profile of FEV1 after NVA237 
50 µg q.d. did show a significant benefit over placebo (except for trough FEV1 at day 7). 
Study A2208 
Study  2208  investigated  once  daily  (q.d)  versus  twice  daily  (b.i.d)  regimen.  It  was  a  randomized, 
double-blind,  placebo  controlled,  eight  treatments,  two-period,  balanced  incomplete  block  study. 
Patients were randomized to one of the 16 sequences to receive two of the eight possible treatments: 
12.5, 25 and 50 µg q.d. and b.i.d, 100 µg q.d. or placebo. Each treatment was taken for 28 days with 
a 7 day washout between each period. 
The primary objective was to evaluate incremental doses of NVA237 q.d. and b.i.d. and the effect on 
trough FEV1 after 28 days of treatment.  
Tovanor Breezhaler 
CHMP assessment report

Study A2208 showed a better effect on trough FEV1 after 28 days of treatment with NVA237 25 µg and 
50 µg b.i.d compared to NVA237 50 µg q.d, with a difference of 0.032 L and 0.051 L respectively. The 
dose of 12.5 µg b.i.d. as well showed a comparable effect to 50 µg q.d.  
Study A2310 
Study  A2310  was  a  multicenter,  randomized,  double  blind,  placebo  controlled,  two  period  cross  over 
study  to  assess  the  effect  of  NVA237  50  µg  q.d.  on  exercise  endurance  in  patients  with  moderate  to 
severe  COPD.  The  treatment  period  was  21  days  at  the  end  of  which  patients  performed  a  sub-
maximal constant load cycle ergometry test (SMETT) to determine their exercise endurance time. 
At  day  21  there  was  a  difference  in  endurance  time  of  89  seconds  when  compared  to  placebo.  The 
improvement  in  exercise  endurance  was  seen  already  after  the  first  dose,  with  a  difference  of  43 
seconds  compared  to  placebo.  NVA237  had  a  positive  impact  on  exercise  endurance  (sub-maximal 
constant-load  cycle  ergometry  test  -  SMETT),  with  an  increase  in  endurance  of  89  seconds  after  21 
days  of  treatment  and  the  effect  on  exercise  endurance  was  present  already  after  the  first  dose  (43 
sec). 
Secondary pharmacology 
Study CNVA237A2108 
Study  A2108  was  a  two  part  study  in  healthy  volunteers.  Part  1  was  a  randomized,  open-label,  two-
period,  crossover  study.  Treatment  periods  were  separated  by  a  washout  period  of  10  to  21  days. 
Treatments  were  single  oral  doses  of  400  μg  NVA237  (content  of  eight  50  μg  inhalation  capsules) 
administered  with  and  without  activated  charcoal.  Ten  subjects  were  enrolled  into  this  part.  The 
primary objective of Part 1 was to determine the effectiveness of oral activated charcoal in reducing or 
blocking the gastrointestinal (GI) absorption of NVA237. 
Part two of Study A2108 determined the absolute bioavailability of inhaled NVA237 (with and without 
activated charcoal) compared to intravenous administration of GP and assessed safety and tolerability 
of the different routes of administration.  
Holter monitoring was performed in Part 2 of Study A2108 for the two i.v. treatments and for inhaled 
NVA237 without charcoal. There is a small decrease in peak heart and mean heart rate under i.v. GP 
when compared to placebo. 
The  results  of  a  QTc  study  showed  that  a  single  dose  of  400  µg  of  NVA237  (8  times  the  projected 
therapeutic dose of 50 µg) had no relevant effect on the corrected QTcF interval. The mean effect and 
upper  limit  of  the    two-sided  90%  CI  both  being  below  the  respective  thresholds  of  5  ms  and  10  ms 
whereas  the  positive  control,  moxifloxacin  showed  the  expected  clinical  effect  on  QTcF  interval.  The 
slight bradycardic effect observed in other studies was also observed in this study. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
NVA237 acts as a competitive antagonist at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors and belong to the class 
of  anti-cholinergics.  Injectable  and  oral  formulations  are  already  in  use.  Other  anticholinergics  in  the 
treatment of COPD are the short acting ipratropium and the long acting tiotropium. 
NVA237  was  developed  as  a  once-daily  inhalation  treatment  in  patients  with  moderate  to  severe 
chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease  (COPD),  delivered  via  a  single  dose  dry  powder  inhaler 
Concept1.  The  dose  and  dosing  regimen  was  selected  based  on  data  from  phase  II  studies  A2205, 
A2206 and A2207 which demonstrated that 50 µg once daily (q.d.) was an effective dose compared to 
Tovanor Breezhaler 
CHMP assessment report

Page 41/84
 
 
placebo,  showed  similar  efficacy  to  tiotropium  and  has  a  wide  therapeutic  index  of  safety.  Different 
dosing regimens (twice daily vs once daily) were compared in study A2208. 
In Study A2205, NVA237 showed a clear dose-response relationship from the doses of NVA237 12.5 µg 
to  100  µg  once  daily  and  NVA237  50  µg  once  daily  had  a  significant  and  relevant  benefit  in  trough 
FEV 1  compared  to  placebo.  The  effect  was  comparable  to  that  of  tiotropium,  which  was  used  as  an 
active comparator in study A2205.  
Study  A2206  was  conducted  to  demonstrate  safety  and  tolerability  with  100  µg  and  200  µg  NVA237 
given for 28 days. Even though the efficacy assessment was a secondary parameter, it was shown that 
the  200  µg  dose  only  offered  marginal  better  effect  on  FEV1  than  100  µg.  No  safety  issues  were 
identified. 
Study  A2207  showed  that  NVA237  50  µg  q.d.  was  significantly  better  than  placebo,  with  an 
improvement in FEV1 after 14 days treatment of 0.154 L. The 24h profile of FEV 1 after 50 µg NVA237 
did show a significant benefit over placebo (except for trough FEV1 at day 7). The study also included 
patients with mild COPD. 
Study A2208 showed a better effect on trough FEV1 after 28 days of treatment with NVA237 25 µg and 
50 µg b.i.d., with a difference of 0.032 L and 0.051 L respectively compared to 50 µg q.d. The dose of 
12.5 µg b.i.d. as well showed a comparable effect to 50 µg q.d.. Looking at the dose-response curve of 
trough FEV 1, a twice daily dosing with 50 µg seem to be more beneficial. 
The  Applicant  uses  two  different  minimal  clinical  relevant  differences,  0.120  L  in  studies  A2205  and 
A2207  (which  was  prespecified  in  the  protocol)  and  0.100  L  (not  prespecified)  in  Study  A2208.  The 
difference  in  trough  FEV 1  after  NVA237  50  µg  once  daily  is  0.109  L.  According  to  study  A2208,  the 
NVA237  25  µg  twice  daily  regimen  offers  a  benefit  in  trough  FEV1  over  NVA237  50  µg  once  daily.  In 
Study  A2208,  the  group  receiving  NVA237  25  µg  twice  daily  had  more  severe  COPD  than  the  ones 
treated with NVA237 50 µg once daily. If this difference in severity of COPD has an impact on trough 
FEV 1, the effect of the twice daily regimen will be underestimated, because the more severe COPD, the 
less benefit of the treatment. 
In  Study  A2310,  NVA237  50  µg  once  daily  compared  to  placebo  had  a  positive  impact  on  exercise 
endurance (sub-maximal constant-load cycle ergometry test - SMETT), with an increase in endurance 
of  89  seconds  after  21  days  of  treatment  and  the  effect  on  exercise  endurance  was  present  already 
after the first dose (43 sec). 
The  results  of  a  QTc  study  showed  that  a  single  dose  of  400  µg  of  NVA237  (8  times  the  projected 
therapeutic dose of 50 µg) had no relevant effect on the corrected QTcF interval. The mean effect and 
upper  limit  of  the    two-sided  90%  CI  both  being  below  the  respective  thresholds  of  5  ms  and  10  ms 
whereas  the  positive  control,  moxifloxacin  showed  the  expected  clinical  effect  on  QTcF  interval.  The 
slight bradycardic effect observed in other studies was also observed in this study. 
In  Study  A2206  laboratory  values  were  largely  unchanged  during  the  study  and  no  impact  from 
NVA237 on vital signs and ECG was seen. An analysis of Fridericias QTc on day 28 shows no significant 
increase compared to placebo. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  pharmacokinetics  of  NVA237  has  been  sufficiently  studied  in  healthy  subjects,  in  COPD  patients 
and  in  patients  with  impaired  renal  function.  Results  are  generally  consistent  across  trials  and  study 
populations.  The  pharmacodynamics  properties  are  adequate  explored.  Overall,  the  clinical 
pharmacology  of  NVA237  was  sufficiently  investigated  by  the  Applicant  and  there  are  no  outstanding 
issues.

2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
A2205 
The study was a placebo controlled study with an active control arm, of an incomplete block cross-over 
design.  Eligible  patients  who  underwent  a  washout  period  from  any  prohibited  medication  were 
randomized  to  one  of  the  available  treatment  sequences.  At  this  point  they  began  the  first  of  four 
double-blind (open-label for tiotropium) 7 day treatment periods. Patients were assessed on Day 1 and 
Day  7  of  each  treatment  period.  There  was  a  washout  period  of  seven  days  between  each  treatment 
period. Treatments were placebo, tiotropium bromide (18 μg), NVA237 12.5, 25, 50 and 100 μg. Each 
patient was randomised to 4/6 1 week treatment periods in an open block design.  
The  presence  of  a  dose  response  effect  was  evaluated  for  statistical  significance  using  two  sided 
hypothesis testing based on the following four main contrasts for this study: 
  NVA237 12.5 μg versus placebo 
  NVA237 25 μg versus placebo 
  NVA237 50 μg versus placebo 
  NVA237 100 μg versus placebo 
The  primary  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  bronchodilatory  efficacy  of  NVA237  in  patients  with  stable 
COPD  in  terms  of  trough  FEV 1  (mean  of  23h  15min  and  23h  45min  post  dose)  following  7  days  of 
treatment, by comparing four doses of NVA237 (12.5, 25, 50 and 100 μg o.d.) with placebo delivered 
by the Single Dose Dry Powder Inhaler (SDDPI). The secondary objective was to determine the efficacy 
of NVA237 in terms of trough FEV1 on Day 1 and a number of different FEV1 and FVC measurements. 
No measurements of disease activity or quality of life were made. 
Patients included in the study were: 
  Male or female adults aged ≥40 years, who signed an Informed Consent Form prior to initiation of 
any study-related procedure. 
 
 
 
Patients with moderate to severe COPD according to the GOLD Guidelines. 
Patients who had a smoking history of at least 10 pack years. Ten pack-years is defined as 20 
cigarettes a day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes a day for 20 years etc. 
Patients with a post-bronchodilator FEV1 ≥30% and < 80% of the predicted normal, and post-
bronchodilator FEV 1/FVC < 0.7 at Visit 2. 
Among  several  relevant  exclusion  criteria  patients  with  a  history  of  asthma  (indicated  by,  but  not 
limited to, blood eosinophil count greater than 400/mm3 or onset of symptoms prior to age 40 years) 
were excluded, but no limit on airway reversibility was used.  
A  total  of  83  patients  were  included  in  the  analysis  study  as  the  modified  intent-to-treat  population 
where the per protocol population was 72. 
For the primary efficacy variable trough FEV 1 at day 7 the results showed that both the 50 ug and 100 
ug NVA237 doses resulted in increases of trough values larger than the minimal relevant clinical effect 
of  120  ml  with  increases  of  131  and  142  ml  respectively.  All  four  doses  of  NVA237  resulted  in 
significant  greater  increases  in  trough FEV1  than  placebo  and  the  50  ug  and  100  ug  NVA237  showed 
results  comparable  to  tiotropium  bromide,  where  the  latter  showed  an increase  in  trough  FEV1of  127 
ml.

For  the  secondary  variable  post-dose  FEV1  measured  successive  in  the  following  24  hours  from  first 
dose at day 1 and last dose at day 7 dose response appeared for NVA237 4 hours after inhalation and 
beyond. 
Dose selection was exclusively based on lung function parameters.  
The  overall  conclusion  that  a  dose  of  50  ug  NVA237  is  adequate  for  a  once-daily  regimen  is  justified 
from the findings of a trough FEV1 greater than the clinical minimum increase of 120 ml, the observed 
similar  results  for  the  100  ug  dose  and  for  tiotropium.  The  choice  of  the  50  µg  dose  for  a  once  daily 
dose  regimen  is  considered  appropriate  since  the  100  µg  dose  is  only  marginally  more  efficacious, 
whereas the 25 µg dose appears considerably less efficacious than the 50 µg dose.  
A2206 
The  primary  objective  of  Study  A2206  was  tolerability  and  safety.  This  study  used  a  three-arm, 
randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicenter study design in patients with 
COPD aged 40 years of age or older. Patients received either NVA237 100 μg, 200 μg or placebo for 28 
days. 
A total of 92 patients were randomized to NVA237 100 ug and 98 were randomized to NVA237 200 ug 
q.d. and 91 to placebo and these three groups defined the intent to treat population. 
For the main efficacy variable among the secondary objectives the trough FEV1 after NVA237 100 and 
200 ug q.d. were both significantly increased when compared to placebo at Day 1, Day 14 and Day 28. 
The difference in absolute value between NVA237 100 ug and placebo in trough FEV1 was a mean of 
131  ml  (Day  1),  146  mL  (Day  14)  and  161  mL  (Day  28).  Likewise  the  difference  in  absolute  value 
between NVA237 200 ug and placebo was 146 mL (Day 1), 193 mL (Day 14) and 151 mL (Day 28). 
The  main  results  obtained  from  Study  2206  relate  to  safety  data.  With  regard  to  efficacy  results 
(secondary  objectives),  both  doses  of  100  and  200  µg  increased  trough  FEV1  significantly  more  than 
placebo, and the absolute increase in trough FEV 1 for both was more than 120 mL when compared to 
placebo. 
A2207 
This study was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period cross-over multicenter trial 
in patients with mild, moderate or severe COPD. A total of 32 patients were to be randomized into one 
of  two  sequences  to  receive  either  NVA237  50  μg  followed  by  placebo  (Sequence  A)  or  placebo 
followed  by  NVA237  50  μg  (Sequence  B).  The  study  consisted  of  a  screening  period  (performed 
between  21  to  2  days  prior  to  first  dose)  and  two  treatment  periods  separated  by  a  7  to  14  day 
washout.  Each  period  consisted  of  a  baseline  on  Day  -1  of  each  period  and  14  days  of  treatment 
followed by a study completion evaluation on Day 15 of period 2. 
The primary objective was to investigate the bronchodilatory efficacy of 50 μg NVA237 over 24 hours 
following 14 days treatment as compared to placebo in patients with mild, moderate or severe (Stage 
I-III)  stable  COPD.  The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  the  standardized  FEV1  AUC0-24h,  i.e.  AUC0-
24h/24, following 14 days of treatment, where 24h was understood as the 23h45 assessment. 
The 33 patients enrolled had a mean age of 60.5 years, a mean duration of COPD of 4.8 years, a mean 
FEV 1 reversibility of 21.8 % (SD = 16.0), and a mean baseline FEV1 pre-ipratropium of 1.79 L. 
For the primary variable on efficacy, the FEV 1 AUC0-24 h (L) on Day 14 active treatment with NVA237 
50  ug  q.d.  resulted  in  a  mean  value  of  1.827  where  placebo  had  a  mean  of  1.664  with  a  resulting 
difference between active and placebo of 0.163 L.

From  the  curve  on  mean  FEV 1  in  24  hours  the  largest  difference  to  placebo  occurred  1  hour  post 
dosing,  the  difference  levelled  off  the  next  1  to  8  hours  and  then  increased  to  a  second  peak  at  13 
hours post dosing and the significant difference to placebo was sustained for 24 hours. 
The study is a small but very detailed study on the clinical profile of improvements in lung function in 
24 hours post dosing of NVA237 50 ug once daily at Day 7 and 14 of continuous treatment, where 31 
adult patients with COPD participated. The patients stayed in the single participating clinic where they 
were  followed  with  lung  function  measurements  for  more  than  24  hours.  The  main  conclusion  of  a 
sustained  and  consistent  increase  in  several  lung  function  parameters  compared  to  placebo  over  24 
hours is solid and the difference in trough FEV1 24 hours post dosing of 0.163 L is clinically relevant. 
A2208 
The  study  was  a  double-blind,  randomized,  dose  finding  trial  utilizing  an  eight-treatment,  two  period 
(29 days each), balanced incomplete block design where the doses were delivered once or twice daily. 
Patients were randomized to 16 independent sequences that resulted from this design. The treatments 
studied were q.d. (12.5 μg q.d., 25 μg q.d., 50 μg q.d and 100 μg q.d.), and b.i.d (12.5 μg b.i.d., 25 
μg  b.i.d.,  and  50  μg  b.i.d),  and  placebo  administered  over  28  days  each.  As  the  study  design 
incorporated  a  twice  dosing  regimen,  all  patients  took  study  medication  (active  or  placebo)  in  the 
morning and in the evening. 
The primary objective was to evaluate the relationship of incremental doses of NVA237 q.d. and b.i.d. 
and  their  effect  on  trough  FEV 1  after  28  days  of  treatment,  as  defined  by  the  percentage  of  the 
maximal  effect  that  each  dose  achieves  in  relation  to  the  maximal  effect  of  NVA237.  (Trough  was 
defined as the mean of FEV1 measurements at 23 h 15 min and 23 h 45 min post morning dose). 
A  key  secondary  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  magnitude  of  any  difference  of  effect  on  trough  FEV1 
after 28 days of treatment between the same total daily doses of NVA237 by comparing once daily and 
twice daily dosing. 
To be randomised to the study at visit 3 the patients had to fulfil the inclusion criteria: 
  Male or female adults ≥40 years of age, who had signed an Informed Consent Form prior to 
initiation of any study-related procedure. 
 
Patients with moderate to severe stable COPD (Stage II or Stage III) according to the GOLD 
Guidelines 2008. 
  Current or ex-smokers who had a smoking history of at least 10 pack years. (Ten pack years were 
defined as 20 cigarettes a day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes a day for 20 years etc.) 
 
Patients with a post-bronchodilator FEV1 ≥30% and < 80% of the predicted normal, and post-
bronchodilator FEV 1/FVC < 0.7 at Visit 2 (Day -8). (Post refers to 45 mins after inhalation of 84 μg 
ipratropium bromide) 
  Symptomatic patients, according to daily electronic diary data between Visit 2 (Day -8) and Visit 3 
(Day 1), with a total score of 1 or more on at least 4 of the last 7 days prior to Visit 3. 
At the second screening visit an anti-cholinergic reversibility test was performed. 
A  dose-response  relationship  on  trough  FEV1  was  observed  in  both  the  once  daily  and  twice  daily 
dosing regimens, where the increase in trough FEV1 compared to placebo was 0.109 L for 50 µg once 
daily and 0.137 L for 100 ug once daily and 0.141 L for 25 ug twice daily compared to 0.160 for 50 µg 
twice  daily.  When  compared  as  50  µg  once  daily  with  50  µg  twice  daily  the  former  results  in  an 
increase  of  0.109  L  above  placebo  while  the  latter  results  in  an  increase  of  0.160  L  compared  to 
Tovanor Breezhaler 
CHMP assessment report

Page 46/84
 
 
placebo, where the 90% confidence interval for the latter is 0.135 to 0.181 and for the former is 0.083 
to 0.135.  
When  comparing  the  primary  endpoint  for  the  different  regimens  at  Day  28,  the  twice  daily  dosing 
provided greater improvement in trough FEV1 compared to placebo than the once daily dosing for the 
total  daily  doses  of  25  µg,  50  µg  and  100  µg.  For  the  50  µg  once  daily  the  treatment  difference 
compared  to  placebo  was  0.109  L  compared  to  0.141  L  for  25  µg  twice  daily.  From  the  confidence 
interval  of  the  observed  differences  the  90%  CI  on  the  differences  does  not  contain  0,  where  for 
example,  the  difference  between  50  ug  once  daily  and  25  ug  twice  daily  is  0.032  L  with  CI  0.012  – 
0.046  L  and  thus  statistically  significantly  (p  <  0.05)  different.  The  same  result  is  obtained  when 
comparing 25 µg once daily with 12.5 µg twice daily and 100 µg once daily to 50 µg twice daily. 
Study A2208 confirms that NVA237 50 µg and 100 µg once daily results in comparable effects on the 
primary  objective  trough  FEV 1  with  increases  of  0.109  L  and  0.137  L  respectively,  confirming  the 
conclusion from  Study  A2205.  When  the  same  total  daily  dose  given  once  daily is  compared  to  twice 
daily, the latter results in significant improvement in the primary variable, trough FEV 1 24 hours post 
dosing, primarily reflecting the effect of the second dose of NVA237 25 µg administered 12 hours prior 
to measurements. The difference in absolute value over placebo is 0.109 L for 50 µg q.d. and 0.141 L 
for 25 µg b.i.d.  
The  once  daily  regimen  has  a  clearly  demonstrated  efficacy  and  offers  a  benefit  regarding  patient 
compliance. However, some limited data suggest that inhaling 25 µg twice daily instead of 50 µg once 
daily may possibly be a better dose schedule in terms of safety and efficacy. In order to address this, 
the  CHMP  requested  a  post-authorisation  clinical  study  to  further  characterise  the  optimal  dosing 
schedule  for  NVA237.  “Optimal  dosing  schedule”  was  considered  as  important  missing  information  at 
the time of Opinion and should be added in the RMP.  
As  for  Study  2205  the  exclusion  criteria  in  relation  to  asthma  were  weak  and  did  not  include  strict 
reversibility  criteria  in  relation  to  lung  function  and  indeed  again  a  significant  degree  of  reversibility 
was observed on day 1 in relation to dosing of NVA237.

Methods 
Study Participants  
Both pivotal studies aimed to include the same target population of adult males and females (age 40 
years  and  over)  with  a  clinical  diagnosis  of  stable  moderate  to  severe  COPD  (GOLD  guidelines  2008) 
and  a  smoking  history  of  at  least  10  years.  In  both  studies  the  individual  investigator  was  to  ensure 
that  all  patients  who  met  the  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  actually  were  offered  enrolment  in  the 
study. Patients were selected at visit 1 and 2 with randomisation at visit 3. 
Both studies had exactly the same inclusion and exclusion criteria: 
Inclusion criteria 
  Male or female adults aged ≥ 40 years, who signed an Informed Consent Form prior to initiation of 
any study-related procedure. 
 
Patients  with  moderate  to  severe  stable  COPD  (Stage  II  or  Stage  III)  according  to  the  (GOLD 
guidelines 2008). 
  Current or ex-smokers who had a smoking history of at least 10 pack years. (Ten pack years are 
defined as 20 cigarettes a day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes a day for 20 years etc.) 
 
Patients  with  a  post-bronchodilator  FEV1≥  30%  and  <  80%  of  the  predicted  normal,  and  post-
bronchodilator FEV 1/FVC < 0.7 at Visit 2 (day -14) 
 
Patients, according to daily electronic diary data between Visit 2 (-14) and Visit 3 (day 1), with a 
total score of 1 or more on at least 4 of the last 7 days prior to Visit 3 
Exclusion criteria 
Among  several  relevant  exclusion  criteria,  patients  with  a  history  of  asthma  (indicated  by,  but  not 
limited to, blood eosinophil count greater than 400/mm3 or onset of symptoms prior to age 40 years) 
were excluded, but no limits on airway reversibility were used. 
Treatments 
A2303 (treatment duration 52 weeks) 
The study treatments were: 
 
Investigational drug - NVA237A 50 μg delivered via a single-dose dry powder inhaler (SDDPI) 
  Matched placebo delivered via SDDPI 
  Open-label tiotropium 18 μg o.d. delivered via the Handihaler 
A2304 (treatment duration 26 weeks)

The study treatments were: 
 
Investigational drug - NVA237A 50 μg delivered via a single-dose dry powder inhaler (SDDPI). 
  Matched placebo delivered via SDDPI. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was identical in the two studies: to confirm that NVA237 50 μg o.d. (delivered 
via  a  SDDPI)  vs.  placebo  significantly  increases  trough  FEV1  (defined  as  mean  evaluation  at  23  h  15 
min and 23 h 45 min post dose) following 12 weeks of treatment in patients with moderate to severe 
COPD  (GOLD guidelines 2008). 
The key secondary objectives were similar but with different observational length in the two studies: 
 
To evaluate the effect of NVA237 (50 μg o.d.) vs. placebo on breathlessness measured  using the 
Transition Dyspnoea Index (TDI) after 26 (both A2304 and A2303) weeks treatment. 
 
To evaluate the effect of NVA237 (50 μg o.d.) vs. placebo on the health status by measuring the 
total  score  of  the  St  George’s  Respiratory  Questionnaire  (SGRQ)  after  26  (A2304)  or  52  (A2303) 
weeks treatment. 
The  important  secondary  objectives  were  similar  but  with  different  observational  length  in  the  two 
studies: 
 
To  evaluate  the  effect  of  NVA237  (50  μg  o.d.)  vs.  placebo  on  time  to  first  COPD  exacerbation 
during 26 (A2304) or 52 (A2303) weeks treatment. 
 
To evaluate the effect of NVA237 (50 μg o.d.) vs. placebo on daily rescue medication use (number 
of puffs) over 26 (A2304) or 52 (A2303) weeks. 
Additional secondary efficacy objectives were: 
 
To evaluate the effect of NVA237 (50 μg o.d.) on lung function (FEV 1, Forced Vital Capacity (FVC)) 
at all time points (including FEV 1 AUC5min-12h and FEV1 AUC5min-24h in a subset of patients, as 
compared with placebo, with respect to the early response, approximate peak response and trough 
response  (AUC  =  area  under  the  curve).  The  subset  of  patients  differed  in  the  two  studies  since 
Study  A2303  intended  a  subset  of  330  patients:  approximately  166  NVA237  patients,  82  placebo 
and  82  tiotropium,  and  Study  A2304  intended  a  subset  of  250  patients:  approximately  167 
NVA237 and 83 placebo. 
 
To  evaluate  the  effect  of  NVA237  (50  μg  o.d.)  vs.  placebo  on  rate  of  COPD  exacerbations  during 
the 26 (A2304) or 52 (A2303) week randomized treatment period. 
 
To evaluate the effect of NVA237 (50 μg o.d.) vs. placebo on other COPD symptoms collected via 
patient diary over the 26 (A2304) or 52 (A2303) week randomized treatment period. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: Trough FEV 1 (at 23 h 15 min and 23 h 45 min post dose) after 12 weeks (visit 9) of 
treatment. The same lung function measurement was repeated at visits 4, 9, 13 and 18 (the latter only 
in A2303). Unless otherwise stated, trough FEV1 assessments excluded values taken within 6 hours of 
rescue medication use or 7 days of systemic corticosteroid use. The baseline FEV 1 measurement was 
defined as the average of the values taken at -45 and -15 min prior to first dose of study drug at Day 
1. 
Tovanor Breezhaler 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/508244/2012 
Page 49/84
 
 
If trough FEV 1 was missing, the pre-dose trough  FEV 1 (the mean of 45 and 15 min pre-dose values) 
was carried forward from the last non missing visit as long as the visit was not prior to Day 15 or from 
a  premature  discontinuation  visit  or  an  unscheduled  visit.  Sensitivity  analyses  (not  using  LOCF  and 
using  the  repeated  measures  approach)  have  confirmed  that  the  LOCF  imputation  method  was 
sufficiently conservative. 
Secondary endpoints:  TDI dyspnoea index, SGRQ score, time to first exacerbation of COPD, number of 
exacerbations, use of rescue medication, 24-hour FEV1 profile, symptoms of COPD collected via patient 
diary. 
TDI index 
Patients were interviewed by an independent, trained assessor who graded the degree  of impairment 
due to dyspnoea at Visit 3 (baseline dyspnoea index (BDI)) and at Visits 8, 12 and 17 (A2303 only) as 
the transitional dyspnoea index (TDI). The same assessor completed all the BDI/TDI assessments for 
an individual patient. 
SGRQ score 
The St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) was used to provide a score on the health related 
quality  of  life.  The  SGRQ  was  always  completed  before  any  other  assessments  were  made  to  avoid 
influencing the responses. The SGRQ scores in three components, where the lowest score is 0 and the 
highest score 100 and the minimal clinically important difference is 4. 
COPD exacerbations 
The  time  to  first  acute  exacerbation  of  COPD  and  the  number  of  exacerbations  in  the  observational 
period was registered from the following definition of exacerbation: 
  Worsening of two or more of the following major symptoms for at least 2 consecutive days: 
o  dyspnoea 
o 
o 
sputum volume 
sputum purulence 
Or: 
  Worsening  of  any  1  major  symptom  together  with  any  1  of  the  following  minor  symptoms  for  at 
least 2 consecutive days: 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
sore throat 
colds (nasal discharge and/or nasal congestion) 
fever without other cause 
increased cough 
increased wheeze 
If  a  patient  experienced  a  COPD  exacerbation  he/she  was  treated  as  deemed  appropriate  by  the 
investigator. 
Furthermore the severity of moderate and severe exacerbations was defined as: 
  moderate severity if treatment with systemic corticosteroids and/or antibiotic was required 
 
severe severity if treatment for moderate severity (listed above) and hospitalisation was required.

Use of rescue medication 
Use  of  rescue  medication  (number  of  puffs  taken  in  the  previous  12  h)  was  recorded  morning  and 
evening by the patient, in the electronic patient diary. 
24-hour FEV 1 profile 
In both pivotal studies a subset of patients performed 12 hour serial spirometry at Visit 3, at 6, 8, 10 
and  12  hours  post  dose  and  twice  a  24  hour  serial  spirometry  at  Visit  8/9  and  Visit  12/13  and  Visit 
17/18 (A2303 only) at 16 and 22 hours post dose in addition. Together with the standard assessments 
where all patients were assessed in the clinic at 45 min and 15 min pre dose and 5, 15, 30 min, 1, 2, 3 
and 4 hr post dose the 24-hour profile consisted of two individual pre dose measurements and a total 
of 13 individual FEV1 measurements in 24 hours post dose. 
Symptoms of COPD 
At Visit 2 (Day −14) all patients were provided with an electronic patient diary to record morning and 
evening  daily  clinical  symptoms;  cough,  wheezing,  shortness  of  breath,  sputum  volume  and  colour, 
night time awakenings and rescue medication (salbutamol/albuterol) use. 
The  patients  were  instructed  to  routinely  complete  the  diary  twice  daily,  before  taking  study  drug  at 
the  same  time  each  morning  and  again  (approximately  12  h  later)  each  evening,  considering  events 
over the previous 12 h. 
Other endpoints:   
a) Inspiratory capacity 
Inspiratory capacity measurements were performed first, before other spirometry measurements, and 
with approximately 3 minutes rest before proceeding with FEV1 and FVC. 
b) FVC 
The forced vital capacity (FVC) was measured and registered together with the FEV1 measurements. 
Sample size 
Both  pivotal  studies  were  designed  with  a  very  high  probability  to  detect  a  clinical  significant 
improvement  in  trough  FEV1  24  hours  post  dose  of  at  least  120  ml.  The  standard  deviation  of  the 
trough FEV1 was estimated to be 270 ml. 
A2303 
The  power  to  detect  a  difference  of  120  mL  in  trough  FEV1  between  NVA237  50  µg  o.d.  and  placebo 
with  standard  deviation  of  270  mL  with  455  evaluable  patients  for  NVA237  and  225  for  placebo  was 
more than 99% with a two-sided test at the 5 % significance level. From the assumption that 15% of 
patients would drop out without data for the primary endpoint  at week 12,  535  patients for NVA237, 
265 for placebo and 265 for tiotropium were to be randomised with a total sample size of 1065. 
The  minimal  important  clinical  difference  for  TDI  is  1  and  from  estimates  that  28  %  on  placebo 
treatment and 42 % on NVA237 would improve at least 1 in TDI and assuming a drop out rate of 20% 
at week 26, 428 evaluable patients for NVA237 and 212 patients for placebo were to give a two-sided 
test  at  the  2.5%  significance  level  with  89%  power.  Likewise  for  SGRQ,  with  a  minimal  important 
improvement of -4 and standard deviation of 13 and a drop out rate of 30% at week 52, 374 evaluable 
patients for NVA237 and 186 for placebo were to give a two-sided test at the 2.5% significance level 
with 88% power.

For  superiority  of  tiotropium  against  placebo  for  trough  FEV1  after  12  weeks  the  power  to  detect  a 
minimum difference of 120 mL with a two-sided test at the 5 % significance level with 225 evaluable 
patients for tiotropium and 225 patients on placebo was more than 99%. 
A2304 
The  power  to  detect  a  difference  of  120  mL  in  trough  FEV1  between  NVA237  50  µg  o.d.  and  placebo 
with  standard  deviation  of  270  mL  with  455  evaluable  patients  for  NVA237  and  225  for  placebo  was 
more than 99% with a two-sided test at the 5 % significance level – identical to the power for A2303. 
From the same assumptions on clinical relevance mentioned above for TDI and SGRQ and a drop out 
rate  of  20%  at  week  26,  a  total  sample  size  of  640  (428  NVA237  and  212  patients  for  placebo) 
provided the 2.5 % significance level (2 sided) with 88% power for TDI and 92% power for SGRQ. 
Both  pivotal  phase  III  studies  were  well-powered  to  detect  a  clinically  relevant  improvement  in  lung 
function  (trough  FEV 1  post  dose),  relevant  reduction  in  dyspnoea  index  and  improvement  in  health 
related quality of life. Assuming that the estimated number of patients were included in all treatment 
arms, the likelihood of detecting significant improvements was 88 to more than 99%.  
Randomisation 
A2303 
At  Visit  3  (day  1),  patients  remained  on  allowed  background  COPD  therapy  consisting  of  inhaled 
corticosteroids  (if  appropriate)  and  short  acting  β2  agonists.  They  were  randomized  to  double-blind 
treatment NVA237 50 μg o.d. or placebo, or to open-label tiotropium 18 μg in a ratio of 2:1:1. 
Randomisation was stratified by: 
1) smoking status (current or ex-smoker), (2) 12/24 hour serial spirometry subgroup (yes or no), and 
(3) Holter participant (yes or no). This resulted in 8 independently randomized pre-treatment strata. A 
treatment  randomisation  of  2:1:1  (NVA237:  placebo:  tiotropium)  was  maintained  at  the  region,  not 
center level. 
A2304 
At  Visit  3,  patients  meeting  the  inclusion/exclusion  criteria  were  randomized  to  receive  double-blind 
NVA237 50 μg o.d. or placebo in a ratio of 2:1, for a 26 week treatment period. 
Randomisation was stratified by: 
1) smoking status (current or ex-smoker), (2) 12/24 hour serial spirometry subgroup (yes or no), and 
(3) Holter participant (yes or no) and/or PK (yes or no). This resulted in 8 independently randomized 
pre-treatment  strata.  A  treatment  randomisation  of  2:1  (NVA237:  placebo)  was  maintained  at  the 
region, not center level. 
Blinding (masking) 
In the comparisons of NVA237 and placebo in both pivotal studies patients, investigator staff, persons 
performing the assessments, and data analysts remained blinded to the identity of the treatment from 
the  time  of  randomisation  until  database  lock,  using  the  following  methods:  (1)  Randomisation  data 
were  kept  strictly  confidential  until  the  time  of  unblinding,  and  were  not  accessible  by  anyone  else 
involved in the study; and (2) The identity of the treatments was concealed by the use of study drugs 
that were identical in packaging, labeling, schedule of administration, appearance, taste and odour.

The third randomisation group in A2303 was treated with tiotropium in an open-label treatment arm as 
mentioned above. 
Statistical methods 
All efficacy variables were analyzed by treatment for the FAS or a subgroup of the FAS (e.g. the serial 
spirometry  subgroups  of  the  FAS).  The  PP  population  set  was  used  for  supportive  analysis  of  the 
primary  variable.  All  treatment  contrasts  with  95%  confidence  intervals  (CIs)  and  p-values  are 
presented.  Significance  after  the  multiplicity  adjustment  where  appropriate  were  flagged.  Multiplicity 
adjustment  using  the  hierarchical  procedure  with  Hochberg  step  up  adjustment  to  control  for  type  I 
error at 0.05 was applied for primary, key secondary and important secondary endpoints. For all other 
endpoints, the p-value was presented without flagging of significant results.  
Results 
Participant flow 
A2303 
A total of 1993 patients were screened and 1066 were randomized to treatment where a total of 810 
patients  (76.0  %)  completed  the  study  as  planned.  The  most  frequent  reasons  for  screening  failure 
were  failing  to  meet  the  diagnostic/severity  criteria  and  unacceptable  test  results  (551  patients  or 
59%).    The  two  most  frequent  reasons  for  discontinuing  from  treatment  were  withdrawal  of  consent 
and adverse events where study discontinuations occurred most frequently in the placebo group (Table 
10-1).

A total of 1324 patients were screened from 128 participating sites of which 822 were randomized to 
two  treatment  groups  with  502  patients  failing  screening  prior  to  randomisation.  Of  the  822  patients 
randomized  to  treatment,  662  (80.5%)  completed  the  study  as  planned.  The  main  reason  for 
screening  failure  was  failing  to  meet  the  protocol  requirements  of  diagnostic/severity  criteria  and  the 
two  most  common  reasons  for  discontinuing  from  treatment  was  again  withdrawal  of  consent  and 
adverse events (Table 10-1). 
Recruitment 
A2303: first patient had first visit on 29 June 2009 and last patient had the last visit on 28 April 2011.  
A2304:  first  patient  had  first  visit  on  29  October  2009  and  last  patient  had  the  last  visit  on  17 
December 2010. 
Conduct of the study 
A2303 
The study protocol was amended twice with the first amendment prior to study start where additional 
lung function measurements were included, further exacerbations in the study period tolerated, follow 
up period extended, the exclusion criteria were extended with exclusion of patients with other relevant 
chest diseases, supporting radiological evidence when pneumonia was suspected as AE and corrections 
of minor inconsistencies. 
The  second  amendment  took  place  after  study  termination  but  before  study  unblinding  where  the 
endpoint “days of poor control” was changed to “symptoms collected” because experience showed the 
end point was not well defined. For consistency reasons the term FAS (Full Analysis Set) replaced the 
term the ITT population. 
Major  protocol  deviations,  leading  to  exclusion  from  the  per  protocol  population,  occurred  in  153 
patients (14.4 %) and in a slightly higher percentage of patients in the placebo group than in patients 
randomized to NVA237 and tiotropium.

A2304 
The  protocol  was  only  amended  once  before  study  start  and  involved  incorporation  of  independent 
adjudication  committee  to  assess  the  cause  of  death  occurring  during  the  study,  replacement  of  the 
terms “safety population” or “ITT” with FAS (Full Analysis Set), addition of more baseline variables and 
addition  of  changes  to  “COPD  exacerbations”  definition  where  “the  definition  of  ‘COPD  exacerbation’ 
has been refined by adding ‘moderate or severe‘ throughout the statistical sections.” 
Major  protocol  deviations,  leading  to  exclusion  from  the  per  protocol  population,  occurred  in  91 
patients  (11.1%)  where  the  most  frequent  was  non-compliance  with  time  of  dosing  at  the  primary 
endpoint in 25 patients. It is stated that major deviations occurred in a higher percentage of patients 
in the placebo group (35 patients, 13.0%) as compared to patients treated with NVA237 (56 patients, 
10.1 %) 
Baseline data 
In both studies basic demographics were comparable (Table 3) although a larger proportion of males 
was  included  in  A2304  (81.9  %)  than  in  A2303  (64.2%)  perhaps  because  of  more  Asian  (Japanese 
subgroup)  patients  in  A2304  (35.4  %)  than  in  A2303  (5.0%).  There  was  also  a  difference  in  mean 
weight of the populations in the two studies where patients in A2303 had a  mean weight of 79 kg in 
contrast  to  a  mean  of  72  kg  in  A2304.  There  was  no  difference  in  basic  characteristics  between 
treatment arms in either of the two studies.

At  visit  2,  the  screening  examination  included  pre-  and  post-bronchodilator  spirometry  including 
reversibility  to  SAMA.  Despite  the  inclusion  criteria  of  moderate  to  severe  COPD  defined  by  a  post 
bronchodilator  FEV 1  >  30%  predicted,  8  (A2303)  and  4  (A2304)  patients  were  actually  included  and 
randomised  with  an  FEV1  %  predicted  post  bronchodilator  value  below  30%  predicted.  In  both  cases 
the  deviation  was  marginal  with  a  minimum  value  of  post  bronchodilator  %  predicted  FEV1  of  27.15 
(A2303) and 28.21 (A2304).

assessed with a SAMA (ipratropium bromide) and in both studies patients included showed a very high 
degree  of  reversibility  with  a  mean  increase  in  FEV1  post  bronchodilator  of  15.85  and  13.67  %  in 
A2303  and  A2304.  With  a  standard  deviation  of  14.9  and  14.1  respectively roughly  15 %  of  patients 
included  in  the  two  studies  had  a  post  bronchodilator  reversibility  of  more  than  30%.  The  maximum 
reversibility measured in one patient was 101 % and 89 % in A2303 and A2304. 
Numbers analysed 
As  mentioned  above,  Study  A2303  and  A2304  employed  the  FAS  (Full  Analysis  Set  –  all  randomised 
patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  medication)  as  the  ITT  population  in  the  protocol, 
while  they  defined  the  per  protocol  populations  as  patients  who  completed  the  studies  without  any 
predefined (defined prior to data lock and un blinding of data) major protocol deviations.

group 
Approximately  a  third  of  the  patient  population  in  A2304  was  Asian,  which  reflected  the  recruitment 
from  India  (147  patients),  Korea  (31  patients),  Singapore  (13  patients)  and  Japan  (96  patients). 
Subgroup  analysis  was  performed  for  the  Japanese  subgroup  where,  for  example,  88  patients  were 
analyzed for difference in trough FEV1 at Day 1. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Efficacy results, primary objective 
In  both  pivotal  studies  the  through  FEV1  at  week  12  was  significantly  higher  in  patients  treated  with 
NVA237 when compared  to placebo. There was an  absolute difference in the least square FEV1 of 97 
mL (A2303) and 108 mL (A2304) when compared to placebo for the full analysis set. In Study A2303, 
the increase in trough FEV1 compared to placebo at week 12 was 83 mL for tiotropium. 
Similarly for the PP population in A2303 both NVA237 and tiotropium were 
statistically significantly superior to placebo for trough FEV1 after 12 weeks of 
treatment with a treatment difference of 86 and 84 mL, respectively. Also in A2304 
for the PP population NVA237 was statistically significantly superior to placebo for 
trough FEV1 after 12 weeks of treatment with a treatment difference of 111 mL. 
Efficacy results, key secondary endpoints – TDI after 26 weeks 
One of the key secondary endpoints in both pivotal studies was transitional 
dyspnoea index to indicate change in dyspnoea compared to baseline where the 
minimal important difference is an improvement of the score of 1 unit. In both 
studies a statistically significant decrease (positive score difference) in dyspnoea 
index was observed for the NVA237 group compared to placebo at week 26 where 
the difference in absolute score value was 0.81 (A2303) and 1.04 (A2304). For 
tiotropium the TDI after 26 weeks compared to placebo was increased in score to an 
absolute value of 0.94.

Efficacy results, key secondary effects – SGRQ after 26 weeks 
The  minimum  important  improvement  is  considered  to  be  a  lowering  of  the  total  score  of  4  units.  In 
both studies the treatment difference between NVA237 and placebo in SGRQ total score at week 26 in 
A2304  (-  2.81  units)  and  at  week  52  in  A2303  (-  3.32  units)  was  in  favour  of  NVA237.    In  Study 
A2303,  tiotropium  was  also  significantly  better  than  placebo,  and  similar  results  were  demonstrated 
when NVA237 was compared with the active comparator.  
Efficacy results, important secondary efficacy endpoints – COPD exacerbation 
In  both  A2303  and  A2304,  time  to  first  exacerbation  was  significantly  increased  with  a  hazard  ratio 
compared to placebo of 0.66 and 0.69 respectively. 
Among  the  additional  secondary  endpoints,  Trough  FEV1  Day1,  Week  26  and  Week  52  (A2303  only) 
were all statistically significantly improved with NVA237 treatment compared to placebo (Tables 7 and 
8 below). 
Ancillary analyses 
Subgroup analyses 
The main subgroup analyses were performed as pooled analyses with population from both A2303 and 
A2304  where  the  effect  of  age,  gender,  smoking  and  other  variables  are  analyzed.  The  results  are 
presented below in the section on analysis performed across trials. 
In A2304 a significant proportion of patients were Japanese and subgroup analysis was performed for 
this  group  on  all  significant  efficacy  variables.  In  short  the  results  were  as  for  the  whole  group  of 
patients without any systematic difference. In some cases the efficacy results did not reach statistical 
significance  where  the  reason  was  the  lower  number  of  patients  in  the  Japanese  subgroup.  The 
superiority of NVA237 versus placebo in terms of trough FEV1, the primary endpoint of this study, was 
consistent  between  the  overall  patient  population  and  the  Japanese  subgroup,  with  a  statistically 
significant treatment difference of 108 mL at Week 12. 
Explorative efficacy results 
In  Study  A2303  the  inspiratory  capacity  (IC)  was statistically  significantly  greater  in  the  NVA237  and 
tiotropium  groups  than  in  the  placebo  group  at  nearly  all  assessed  time  points  at  Day  1,  Week  12, 
Week 26 and Week 52 where the only exceptions were in pre-dose measurements. 
This result was confirmed in Study A2304 where IC was statistically significantly greater in the NVA237 
group  than  in  the  placebo  group  at  all  assessed  time  points.  The  treatment  difference  at  Week  26  at 
trough (23 h 40 min) was 113 mL (p<0.001). 
As  a  measure  of  medical  resource  utilisation,  the  number  of  hospital  admissions,  emergency  room 
visits  and  unscheduled  doctor’s  visits  during  the  26  (A2304)  or  52  (A2303)  week  long  observational 
period was registered.  
In  both  pivotal  studies,  the  frequency  of  the  three  measures  of  medical  resource  utilisation  was  very 
low in both active treatment arms and placebo arms. In Study A2304, the majority of patients had no 
hospital admissions (98.2% in the NVA237 group and 95.9% in the placebo group). A total of 2.6% of 
patients  overall  had  ≥  1  hospital  admission.  More  patients  in  the  placebo  group  (4.1%)  than  in  the 
NVA237  group  (1.8%)  had  at  least  one  hospital  admission.  In  Study  A2303,  96.6  %  in  the  NVA237 
group,  94.8  %  in  the  tiotropium  group  and  94.0  %  in  the  placebo  group  had  no  hospital  admissions 
during the 52 week treatment period.

Analysis description 
The FEV1, TDI. SGRQ and rescue medication use were analysed using a 
mixed model for the FAS with baseline value, baseline ICS use (Yes/No), 
FEV1 prior to inhalation of short acting bronchodilator and FEV1 45 min post 
inhalation of short acting bronchodilator as covariates and treatment, 
smoking status (current/ex-smoker) and region as fixed effects with center 
nested within region as a random effect. 
Analysis of time to first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation used Cox 
regression model, including terms for treatment, baseline inhaled 
corticosteroid use (Yes/No), baseline total symptom score, COPD 
exacerbation history (the number of moderate or severe COPD 
exacerbations in the year prior to screening), FEV1 prior to inhalation of 
short acting bronchodilator, FEV1 45 min post inhalation of short acting 
bronchodilator, smoking history, region.

Analysis description 
The FEV1, TDI. SGRQ and rescue medication use were analysed using a 
mixed model for the FAS with baseline value, baseline ICS use (Yes/No),  
FEV 1 prior to inhalation of short acting bronchodilator and FEV1 45 min post 
inhalation of short acting bronchodilator as covariates and treatment, 
smoking status (current/ex-smoker) and region as fixed effects with center 
nested within region as a random effect. 
Analysis of time to first moderate or severe COPD exacerbation used Cox 
regression model, including terms for treatment, baseline inhaled 
corticosteroid use (Yes/No), baseline total symptom score, COPD 
exacerbation history (the number of moderate or severe COPD 
exacerbations in the year prior to screening), FEV1 prior to inhalation of 
short acting bronchodilator, FEV1 45 min post inhalation of short acting 
bronchodilator, smoking history, region. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The  Applicant  has  conducted  an  extensive  pooled  analysis  of  the  two  pivotal  studies,  A2303  and 
A2304.  The  two  pivotal  studies  individually  demonstrate  statistically  significant  effects  in  all  key 
variables  when  NVA237  were  compared  to  placebo  treatment.  As  such  the  supportive  evidence  from 
pooled analyses of efficacy data becomes less important in the efficacy analysis of NVA237 compared 
to  placebo.  The  most  important  analyses  performed  across  the  two  pivotal  studies  are  subgroup 
analyses  on  basic  patients  profile  data  to  detect  possible  differences  in  treatment  effects  observed  in 
different patient groups.

The pooled population included 1,888 randomized patients, of which 78.0% completed the studies. The 
pooled  population  included  1,888  randomized  patients,  of  which  78.0%  completed  the  studies. 
Approximately half the patients in each group were using ICS at baseline, 59.6% of the patients were 
ex-smokers, and the overall mean smoking history was 47.6 pack years. The mean post-bronchodilator 
% predicted FEV 1 was 55.5%. Mean reversibility to ipratropium bromide (80 μg) was 15.1%. 
In terms of efficacy results overall the pooled analysis reflected and supported the individual replicated 
results seen in the two pivotal studies. For the primary endpoint trough FEV1 at week 12 the individual 
studies showed an increase in comparison to placebo in through FEV1 of 108 and 97 mL in A2304 and 
A2303 respectively with 95% confidence intervals of 79 to 137 mL and 65 to 130 mL in the two studies 
with  populations  of  NVA237  treated  patients  of  512  and  513  patients.  In  the  pooled  analysis  where 
1059  patients  treated  with  NCV237  50  µg  once  daily  was  compared  to  528  patients  treated  with 
placebo  the  mean  difference  in  through  FEV1  Week  12  was  103  mL  and  with  a  narrower  95% 
confidence interval of between 81 mL and 125 mL. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
The  applicant  has  conducted  a  study  in  renal  impairment  which  showed  an  increase  in  exposure 
(AUClast) of up to 1.4-fold  in subjects with mild and moderate  impairment, as compared to healthy 
controls. An increase of up to 2.2-fold was seen in subjects with severe renal impairment. 
No study in hepatic impairment was conducted on the basis that renal elimination is predominant. 
There  is  no  specific  study  in  the  elderly.  Population  PK  modelling  suggested  an  increase  in  exposure 
with increasing age of about 70% between patients in their 40s and those of 80+. 
Supportive studies 
A2310 
The  study  was  a  multi-centre,  double-blind,  randomized,  placebo-controlled,  two-period  cross-over 
study. There were two 3-week treatment periods with each treatment period being separated by a 14–
day  wash-out  (wash-out  period  could  be  expanded  up  to  28  days,  if  required  for  logistical  reasons) 
(Figure 9-1). A planned number of approximately 80 patients with moderate to severe COPD were to 
be randomized to receive one of two treatment sequences: 
NVA237 followed by matched placebo or placebo followed by NVA237. 
The primary objective was to determine the effect of 50 μg NVA237 compared with matching placebo 
inhaled  once  daily  on  exercise  tolerance  as  measured  by  exercise  endurance  time  during  a  sub-
maximal constant-load cycle ergometry test (SMETT) after three weeks of treatment. 
The sub-maximal constant-load cycle ergometry (Baseline, Day 1, Day 21 of both treatment periods) 
was defined as an exercise procedure where the patient cycles at 80% of the Wmax value achieved at 
a previous incremental exercise test. 
A  total  of  108  patients  were  randomized  to  the  study,  where  99  patients  contributed  to  the 
pharmacodynamic profile of NVA 237 (PD analysis set). 
NVA237  treatment  was  statistically  significantly  superior  to  placebo  with  respect  to  patients  exercise 
endurance time after 3 weeks (at Day 21) of treatment. The LS mean treatment difference was 88.93 
sec with a p-value <0.001; an improvement by NVA237 of about 21%.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  clinical  development  of  NVA237  consisted  of  a  total  of  12  studies:  five  Phase  I  studies 
(NVA237A2103,  A2104,  A2105,  A2108,  and  A2109),  four  Phase  II  studies  (NVA237A2205,  A2206, 
A2207 and A2208) and three Phase III studies (NVA237A2304, A2303 and A2310). 
The  NVA237  program  was  based,  amongst  others,  on  the  EMA’s  “Points  to  consider  on  clinical 
investigation  of  medicinal  products  in  the  chronic  treatment  of  patients  with  Chronic  Obstructive 
Pulmonary Disease (COPD)”.  
With  respect  to  the  overall  efficacy  documentation,  the  Applicant  has  chosen  a  very  detailed  and 
comprehensive programme of both objective endpoints and measures of symptomatic improvement in 
both pivotal studies.  
In all 6 phase II and phase III studies not the most robust clinical criteria have been used to exclude 
patients suspected of asthma disease. However, despite the fact that the exclusion of asthma is mainly 
based  on  medical  records  and  history,  the  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  employed  in  the  pivotal 
clinical studies are considered sufficient to ensure that enrolled patient reflect a general population of 
patients  with  moderate-severe  COPD.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  degree  of  reversibility  of  airflow 
limitation as measured  by FEV 1 before and after bronchodilator is no longer recommended to aid the 
differential diagnosis with asthma (GOLD 2011). 
On  dose  finding,  specific  dose  response  studies  with  double  blind,  randomised,  placebo  controlled 
design are required. In the present application, the decisive dose finding study is Study A2205 where 
NVA237  50  µg  once  daily  results  in  a  mean  increase  in  through  FEV1  over  placebo  of  131  mL  where 
NVA237 25 µg only increased through FEV1 90 mL over placebo and NVA237 100 µg was comparable 
to 50 µg with an increase in through FEV 1 of 142 mL over placebo with a minimum clinical important 
difference  in  through  FEV 1  of  100-140  mL.  This  result  was  confirmed  in  A2208.  Both  studies  were 
double blind, placebo controlled studies. 
As to the dosing frequency, Study A2208 in a large and complicated design shows that trough FEV 1 is 
increased  with  109  mL  on  NVA237  50  µg  once  daily  and  increased  with  141  mL  on  NVA237  25  FEV1 
twice  daily.  Further  analyses  have  been  provided  indicating  that  the  difference  between  NVA237  and 
placebo AUC FEV 1 is maintained over 24 hours with 50 µg once daily, but that there is drop-off from 
12 to 24 hours. 
The  efficacy  of  the  selected  once  daily  regimen  has  been  clearly  demonstrated  and  offers  a  benefit 
regarding  patient  compliance.  However,  some  limited  data  suggest that  inhaling  25  µg  twice  daily 
instead of 50 µg once daily may possibly be a better dose schedule in terms of safety and efficacy.  In 
order  to  address  this,  the  CHMP  requested  a  post-authorisation  clinical  study  to  further  characterise 
the  optimal  dosing  schedule  for  NVA237.  “Optimal  dosing  schedule”  was  considered  as  important 
missing  information  at  the  time  of  Opinion  and  should  be  added in  the  RMP.  The  study  will  be  a  26-
week treatment, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to compare the efficacy, 
safety and tolerability of NVA237 given once and twice daily in patients with stable Chronic Obstructive 
Pulmonary Disease and moderate to severe airflow obstruction. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The  outcomes  of  both  studies  are  consistent  and  show  clinically  relevant  improvements  in  most 
outcome measures. In both studies an increase in primary endpoint trough FEV1 week 12 statistically 
significant  superior  to  placebo  and  above  or  at  the  minimum  clinical  important  difference  is 
documented,  and  the  improvement  in  lung  function  is  supported  by  different  means  of  lung  function 
Tovanor Breezhaler 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/508244/2012 
Page 66/84
 
 
and  by  numerous  repeated  measurements  over  time  (24  h)  and  26  to  52  weeks,  where  all 
measurements show consistent improvements over placebo. Symptomatic benefit is also documented 
in  both  studies  from  improvements  in  TDI  and  SGRQ  over  time  when  NVA237  50  µg  once  daily  is 
compared to placebo. But it should be noted that the effects on these symptomatic measures are not 
very large as the clinically significant differences expected to be found are either not met in SGQR in 
any of the pivotal studies or not met in TDI (Study A2303) or borderline achieved (Study A2304). Both 
studies  also  document  a  modest,  but  relevant  decrease  in  frequency  of  moderate  and  severe  COPD 
exacerbations  and  improvement  in  terms  of  use  of  rescue  medication  in  NVA  237-treated  patients 
compared  to  placebo.  However,  the  totality  of  the  efficacy  data  from  the  pivotal  studies  (spirometry, 
exacerbations and patient-reported outcomes, use of rescue medication etc.) are considered to reflect 
a clinically relevant benefit in COPD patients.  
Clinical efficacy of NVA237 is supported by the open label comparison with the long acting muscarinic 
antagonist tiotropium where efficacy measures generally show similar or numerically better results of 
NVA237 compared to tiotropium. 
In  the  third  supportive  phase  III  clinical  trial  (Study  A2310),  efficacy  is  further  documented  by  a 
statistically significant increase in exercise endurance in seconds in patients treated with NVA237 and 
compared to placebo where exercise endurance increases 21% over placebo. 
Subgroup analysis was performed in the pooled populations of studies A2303 and A2304 where there 
were no systematic efficacy differences in relation to relevant demographic factors (age, gender, race 
and  region)  and  no  systematic  efficacy  differences  in  relation  to  smoking  status,  use  of  ICS  or  COPD 
severity. Objective lung function outcomes appear to correlate with baseline reversibility: i.e. patients 
with  greater  reversibility  having  a  better  lung  function  benefit.  This  is  not  an  unexpected  finding 
considering  the  pharmacological  mechanism  of  the  drug.  The  relation  between  baseline  reversibility 
and symptomatic outcomes is not as strong. There are statistically significant benefits of NVA 237 over 
placebo  in  terms  of  trough  FEV 1  for  all  the  tested  reversibility  groups,  but  the  clinical  relevance  is 
questionable in the low reversibility groups. However, it is considered that these subgroup analyses do 
not justify requiring reversibility testing and restricting NVA 237 therapy to patients exhibiting a high 
degree of reversibility at treatment start. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In conclusion, the efficacy of NVA237 50 µg once daily over placebo in terms of improvement in lung 
function  measurements  and  relevant  measures  of  symptomatic  benefit  has  been  documented  in  the 
two pivotal studies and is supported by a phase II study and a further phase III study. 
According to Study A2208, the NVA237 25 µg twice daily regimen offers a benefit in trough FEV1 over 
NVA237  50  µg  once  daily.  However,  this  data  is  limited,  the  efficacy  of  the  once  daily  regimen  has 
been  clearly  demonstrated  and  it  offers  a  benefit  regarding  patient  compliance.  In  order  to  address 
this, the CHMP considers the following measure necessary:  
The applicant will conduct a post-authorisation clinical study to further characterise the optimal dosing 
schedule  for  NVA237.  “Optimal  dosing  schedule”  was  considered  as  important  missing  information  at 
the  time  of  Opinion  and  should  be  added in  the  RMP.  The  study  will  be  a  26-week  treatment,  multi-
center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study to compare the efficacy, safety and tolerability 
of  NVA237  given  once  and  twice  daily  in  patients  with  stable  Chronic  Obstructive  Pulmonary  Disease 
and moderate to severe airflow obstruction).

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
At the data lock point for the Summary of Clinical Safety provided by the Applicant, 2296 patients had 
been treated with NVA237 (including all inhaled dosages and dose regimens), for a total of about 773 
patient-years.  The  Major  Safety  database  includes  2436  patients,  1353  of  whom  received  NVA237 
treatment;  exposure  in  total  patient-years  for patients  who  received  NVA237  was  about  712  patient-
years.  The  Short-term  Safety  database  includes  1242  COPD  patients  receiving  doses  of  NVA237 
ranging  from  12.5  μg  to  200  μg.  The  overall  mean  exposure  for  patients  who  received  short-term 
treatment in the NVA237 50 μg group was 0.3 patient-years. 
A  summary  of  the  number  of  patients  exposed  and  the  duration  of  exposure  for  the  Core  6-month 
Safety  database  and  the  Core  12-month  Safety  database  is  presented  in  Table  1-6  and  Table  1-7, 
respectively. 
Tovanor Breezhaler 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/508244/2012 
Page 68/84
 
 
 
 
The  6-month  and  12-month  exposure  to  NVA237  at  the  applied  dose  (50  μg  group)  comfortably 
exceed the recommended numbers in the guideline (300-600 and 100 patients, respectively). 
The  number  of  COPD  patients  exposed  to  NVA237  at  50  μg  o.d.  irrespective  of  exposure  duration  is 
n=1361. 
Adverse events  
Summaries  of  AEs  and  SAEs  are  based  on  treatment-emergent  (i.e.  newly  occurring  or  worsening) 
undesirable signs, symptoms, or medical conditions after the first dose of study drug, including events 
likely to be related to the underlying disease or likely to represent concomitant illness. Any AEs whose 
start  dates  were  before  the  first  dose  date  were  considered  as  medical  history.  The  reporting  of  AEs 
covers  common  AEs,  SAEs/death,  and  other  significant  AEs.  The  occurrence  of  AEs  was  detected  by 
non-directive questioning of the patient at each visit during the study, when they were volunteered by 
the  patient  during  or  between  visits,  or  through  physical  examination,  laboratory  test,  or  other 
assessments. Patients also recorded daily clinical symptoms in an electronic diary.  
AEs are summarized by preferred term for the most frequent AEs (≥ 1.5% in any group) in the Core 6-
month  Safety  database  in  Table  2-1  (below).  The  1.5%  threshold  used  in  the  summary  table  was 
chosen to enable concise presentation based on overall AE frequencies.

The  overall  frequency  of  AEs  in  the  Core  6-month  Safety  database  was  lower  in  the  NVA237  group 
(59.8%)  compared  to  the  placebo  (66.7%)  and  tiotropium  treatment  groups  (65.2%).  The  most 
frequent  AE  by  preferred  term  was  COPD,  which  was  reported  less  frequently  in  the  NVA237  and 
tiotropium groups compared with the placebo group. Other frequent AEs were upper respiratory tract

infection  (URTI),  nasopharyngitis,  cough,  bacterial  URTI,  and  headache.  All  of  these  events  were 
reported with lower frequency in the NVA237 group as compared to the placebo group. 
Typical  anticholinergic  AEs  that  were  more  frequent  in  the  NVA237  group  than  the  placebo  and 
tiotropium  groups  in  the  Core  6-month  Safety  database  included  dry  mouth  (2.2%  for  the  NVA237 
group, 1.1% in the placebo group, and 1.5% in the tiotropium group), as AEs were less frequent in the 
NVA237  and  tiotropium  groups  compared  to  the  placebo  group  for  constipation  (NVA237  0.9%, 
placebo  1.5%,  and  tiotropium  0)  and  blurred  vision  (NVA237  0.5%,  placebo  0.6%,  and  tiotropium 
0.4%).  Benign  prostatic  hyperplasia  was  reported  in  the  NVA237  and  tiotropium  groups  (0.3%  and 
0.8%, respectively), but not in the placebo group. Glaucoma was reported in 1 patient (0.1%) in the 
NVA237  group  but  not  in  the  placebo  or  tiotropium  groups  (not  apparent  from  table).  Urinary  tract 
infection  was  more  frequent  in  the  tiotropium  group  (3.8%)  than  the  NVA237  and  placebo  groups 
(1.8% and 1.9%, respectively) (Table 2-1). Overall, the frequency of these events was low. 
In the Core 6-month Safety database, AEs with an absolute frequency in the NVA237 group of at least 
0.5% (corresponding to approximately 5 patients) and at least a 1.5-fold higher frequency than in the 
placebo group were defined as potential ADRs and tabulated below: 
Despite  the  fact  that  none  of  the  OR  confidence  intervals  for  potential  adverse  drug  reaction 
frequencies NVA237 vs. placebo excluded 1, it appears evident that dry mouth is truly an adverse drug 
reaction related to NVA237 taking the pharmacological mode of action into consideration. 
Dysuria is reported in notably more patients on NVA237 than in the placebo group. Although not very 
typical,  this  could  possibly  represent  an  anticholinergic  effect  of  NVA237.  Also  other  anticholinergic 
adverse  events  appear  to  be  more  frequent  in  the  NVA237  (and  the  tiotropium)  group  than  in  the 
placebo group, although in small numbers and not apparent from the table above. 
Atrial  fibrillation  when  reported  as  adverse  events  occurred  more  frequently  among  NVA237-treated 
patients (and in patients on tiotropium) than in patients on placebo. But when looking at adjudicated 
ECG recordings, the number of patients with a new or worsening ECG finding of atrial fibrillation was 
Tovanor Breezhaler 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/508244/2012 
Page 71/84
 
 
 
similar  for  NVA237  and  placebo.  However,  atrial  fibrillation  has  been  inserted  in  section  4.8  of  the 
SmPC and included in the RMP as a potential risk.  
For  the  remaining  adverse  events  where  an  excess  in  NVA237-treated  patients  was  shown,  the 
differences could very well be chance findings. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In all completed studies, a total of 14 deaths occurred, which included 12 patients who died during the 
active  treatment  period  and  2  patients  who  died  during  the  30  day  follow-up  period.  Seven  of  these 
deaths occurred in the NVA237 group, 5 deaths occurred in the placebo group, and 2 deaths occurred 
in the tiotropium group. 
There is no indication that any of the death cases were causally related to treatment with NVA237. 
The table summarizes SAEs by primary system organ class and preferred term (occurring in at least 2 
patients in any treatment group) in the Core 6-month Safety database. 
Tovanor Breezhaler 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/508244/2012 
Page 72/84
 
 
Overall the frequency and nature of serious adverse events are considered to be typical for a moderate 
to  severe  COPD  population.  Acute  coronary  syndrome/myocardial  infarction  were  reported  in  slightly 
more patients treated with NVA237 compared to patients treated with placebo or tiotropium. However, 
when taking number of patients in the treatment groups as well as exposure into account, there is no 
suggestion of any significant excess on NVA237. 
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory data submitted by the Applicant included haematology, blood chemistry, and urinalysis. The 
reporting was presented only for the COPD Major Safety database using the International System (SI) 
units.  
Tovanor Breezhaler 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/508244/2012 
Page 73/84
 
 
 
 
Overall,  the  haematology  results  are  unremarkable.  There  was  a  slight  imbalance  with  regard  to 
clinically  notable  decrease  in  haemoglobin  in  the  NVA237  group  compared  to  the  placebo  and 
tiotropium groups, but this could very well be a chance finding and was not considered to be clinically 
significant. 
The clinical chemistry and urinalysis results are overall considered to be unremarkable. 
Systolic  and  diastolic  pressure  results  were  not  suggestive  of  any  relevant  difference  between 
treatment groups. 
Notably  low  pulse  rates  were  more  common  in  the  NVA237  group  (and  the  tiotropium  group)  at  all 
time  intervals  than  in  the  placebo  group.  This  is  not  readily  explained  by  the  pharmacology  of  the 
NVA237. It may be an effect of NVA 237 (a bradycardic effect was seen with a larger inhaled dose in 
the  thorough  QTc  study),  but  it  could  also  be  caused  by  the  fact  that  patients  in  the  placebo  group 
were more frequently treated with beta2-agonists. The finding was not considered clinically significant. 
Notably  higher  body  weight  was  more  frequent  in  the  NVA237  group  compared  to  the  placebo  group 
after  6  months  and  after  12  months.  Although  numerical  differences  were  small,  body  weight  mean 
difference  from  baseline  was  larger  for  NVA235-treated  patients  than  for  patients  on  placebo.  The 
finding  could  be  secondary  to  the  efficacy  advantage  associated  with  NVA  237  (COPD  patients  are 
often underweight). It was not considered to be clinically significant. 
With  regard  to  ECG,  for  most  time  points,  the  mean  change  from  baseline  in  QTcF  was  larger  in 
NVA237-treated  patients  than  in  placebo-treated  patients.  However,  the  differences  were  very  small 
(up  to  1.9  ms),  and  the  pattern  was  not  consistent.  There  are  no  consistent,  relevant  differences 
between NVA237 and placebo in the categorical analyses of patients experiencing high QTcF values or 
patients experiencing large increases in QTcF.  
Safety in special populations 
AEs  were  evaluated  in  demographic  subgroups  (age,  gender,  and  race),  by  baseline  characteristics 
(COPD severity, and CCV risk factors) by exposure category and baseline steroid use. 
Effect of age 
Overall  and  for  respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  (1st  most  frequent  SOC)  and  for 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (3rd most frequent SOC), there was no clear tendency 
that  elderly  patients  experienced  adverse  events  more  frequently  than  younger  patients.  When 
adjusting for the frequencies in the placebo group, there was no clear indication that NVA237 caused a 
higher adverse event reporting in elderly patients compared to younger patients. However, the number 
of patients in the 75+ years group was low. 
Of all AEs reported on NVA237 in the >75 years group, 91% had a placebo-corrected difference in the 
AE frequency of less than one per cent compared to the younger age groups. The frequency was > 1% 
higher for 13/138 AEs and 12/203 AEs in the group of >75 years than in that of 65-75 years and <65 
years respectively. Of these headache and urinary tract infection were reported most frequently in the 
>75 years population and is proposed to be mentioned in the SmPC.

Page 74/84
 
 
Effect of gender 
Female patients tended to report adverse events more frequently than male patients. Overall and for 
the three most frequent SOCs, when adjusting for the frequencies in the placebo group, there was no 
clear indication that NVA237 had a significantly different adverse event profile in women than in men 
although the difference between NVA237 and placebo in favour of NVA237 was less in female patients. 
The proportion of patients with AEs on NVA237 and placebo were 56.6% and 65.2% in males and 68.8 
and  70.8%  in  females,  respectively.  Of  all  AEs  reported  on  NVA237  in  the  female  group  12%  (24  of 
204)  had  a  placebo-corrected  difference  in  the  frequency  of  AEs  of  0.5%  or  more  compared  to  the 
male group and of the male group 2% (6 of 341) had a placebo-corrected difference in the frequency 
of 0.5% or more compared to the female group. This indicates similar AE profile across gender. 
The  following  AEs  were  >1%  more  frequent  in  females  than  in  males:  influenza-like  symptoms, 
musculoskeletal pain, nasopharyngitis, rhinitis and urinary tract infection. In males only dry mouth was 
more  than  one  per  cent  more  frequent  than  in  females.  Atrial  fibrillation  was  also  more  frequent  in 
males than in females. 
Effect of race 
Caucasian patients constituted the vast majority of patients. There were a much smaller proportion of 
Asian  patients  and  a  very  limited  number  of  patients  representing  other  races.  Overall,  there  is  no 
suggestion  of  an  effect  of  race  in  the  adverse  event  profile  of  NVA237,  but  this  conclusion  is  limited 
because of the predominance of Caucasian patients. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
In vitro studies showed that NVA237 is unlikely to inhibit or to induce the metabolism of other drugs, 
as well as processes involving drug transporters. Metabolism plays a secondary role in the elimination 
of  NVA237  and  multiple  enzymes  are  involved.  Inhibition  or  induction  of  metabolism  of  NVA237  is 
unlikely to result in a relevant change of NVA237 exposure. 
In  clinical  pharmacokinetic  studies,  no  clinically  relevant  interaction  was  observed  when  NVA237  was 
administered  concomitantly  with  indacaterol,  an  inhaled  beta  2-adrenergic  agonist,  or  cimetidine,  an 
orally given inhibitor of the organic cation transport in the kidneys.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
With  regard  to  the  Core  6-month  Safety  database,  discontinuations  due  to  AEs  were  lower  in  the 
NVA237 group (6.0%) and tiotropium group (6.0%) compared to the placebo group (8.2%). The most 
frequently reported AE leading to discontinuation of study drug by preferred term was COPD (NVA237 
1.7%, placebo 3.6%, and tiotropium 3.0%). Myocardial infarction was reported in 0.2% of patients (2 
patients) in the NVA237 group and 0.4% of patients (1 patient) in the tiotropium group; no cases were 
reported in the placebo group.  
The  frequency  of  atrial  fibrillation  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study  drug  was  0.28%  in  the  NVA237 
group; this AE was not reported in the placebo or tiotropium groups. 
With regard to the Core 12-month Safety database, discontinuations due to AEs were less frequent in 
the NVA237 group (8.0%) and tiotropium group (7.5%) compared to the placebo group (11.6%). The 
most  frequently  reported  AE  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study  drug  by  preferred  term  was  COPD 
(NVA237 1.9%, placebo 4.9%, and tiotropium 3.7%). 
The  frequency  of  the  AE  of  atrial  fibrillation  (preferred  term)  leading  to  discontinuation  of  study  drug 
was  0.2%  (1  patient)  in  the  NVA237  group;  this  AE  was  not  reported  in  the  tiotropium  or  placebo 
groups. 
Post marketing experience 
There are no post-marketing surveillance data available for NVA237 for the target indication of COPD.  
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics.  
The  overall  incidence  of  adverse  events  (in  the  6-month  database)  as  well  as  a  number  of  adverse 
events related to COPD/symptoms of COPD in the NVA237 group does not raise concerns. It appears 
evident that dry mouth is truly an adverse drug reaction related to NVA237 taking the pharmacological 
mode of action into consideration. Other anticholinergic adverse events appear to be more frequent in 
the NVA237 (and the tiotropium) group than in the placebo group, although in small numbers. 
Atrial fibrillation when reported as an adverse event occurred more frequently among NVA237-treated 
patients  than  in  patients  on  placebo.  However,  when  looking  at  adjudicated  ECG  recordings,  the 
number  of  patients  with  a  new  or  worsening  ECG  finding  of  atrial  fibrillation  was  similar  for  NVA237 
and  placebo.  Nevertheless,  information  has  been  added  to  the  SmPC  and  included  in  the  RMP  as  a 
potential risk. 
In view of the potential risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes related to the mechanism of action of 
anticholinergic  quaternary  ammonium compounds  and  the  concerns  on  cardiovascular  safety  of  same 
class  products,  adverse  CV  outcomes  should  be  followed  closely  in  the  post-marketing  setting. 
Consequently, the CHMP requested a Post-Authorisation Safety Study (PASS) to monitor cardiovascular 
and cerebrovascular outcomes post-marketing. The objective of this study will be to assess the relative 
risks  of  specific  cardiovascular  and  cerebrovascular  outcomes  among  new  users  of  inhaled 
glycopyrronium compared to new users of non-NVA237 comparator drugs.  
Additionally,  the  CHMP  requested  a  Drug  utilisation  study  to  quantify  the  subpopulation  with 
cardiovascular co-morbidity and to identify patient groups with missing information in the RMP. Missing 
information  include  prevalence  of  unstable  angina,  arrhythmia  and  long  QT-syndrome  in  NVA237 
users.  This  will  be  a  multinational,  multi-database  drug  utilisation  study  of  inhaled  glycopyrronium  in

Europe. There is no indication that any of the death cases in the development programme are causally 
related to treatment with NVA237. 
The  frequency  and  nature  of  serious  adverse  events  are  generally  considered  to  be  typical  for  a 
moderate  to  severe  COPD  population.  With  the  possible  exception  of  atrial  fibrillation,  there  is  no 
indication that the reported serious adverse events are causally related to NVA237 treatment.  
The laboratory findings are satisfactory with no clinically relevant findings. 
In  terms  of  special  populations,  there  is  no  clear  tendency  that  elderly  patients  experienced  adverse 
events more frequently than younger patients, although the number of patients in the 75+ years group 
is low. Regarding gender, female patients tended to report adverse events more frequently than male 
patients. However, when adjusting for the frequencies in the placebo group, there is no clear indication 
that  NVA237  has  a  significantly  different  adverse  event  profile  in  women  than  in  men.  There  is  no 
suggestion  of  an  effect  of  race  in  the  adverse  event  profile  of  NVA237,  although  there  was  a 
predominance of Caucasian patients. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
No major concerns were identified with regard to the safety of NVA237. The adverse events observed 
were  typical  of  a  moderately  to  severely  affected  COPD  population.  As  expected  from  the 
pharmacological profile of NVA237, a number of anticholinergic adverse events appeared to be causally 
related to the use of NVA237, in particular dry mouth, but generally the excess numbers were low. 
Atrial fibrillation when reported as an adverse event occurred more frequently among NVA237-treated 
patients  than  in  patients  on  placebo.  However,  when  looking  at  adjudicated  ECG  recordings,  the 
number  of  patients  with  a  new  or  worsening  ECG  finding  of  atrial  fibrillation  was  similar  for  NVA237 
and  placebo.  Nevertheless,  information  has  been  added  to  the  SmPC  and  included  in  the  RMP  as  a 
potential risk. 
In view of the potential risk of adverse cardiovascular outcomes related to the mechanism of action of 
anticholinergic  quaternary  ammonium compounds  and  the  concerns  on  cardiovascular  safety  of  same 
class  products,  adverse  CV  outcomes  should  be  followed  closely  in  the  post-marketing  setting. 
Consequently, the CHMP requested a Post-Authorisation Safety Study (PASS) to monitor cardiovascular 
and cerebrovascular outcomes post-marketing. 
On  top  of  the  above-mentioned  PASS,  cardio-  and  cerebrovascular  events  will  be  monitored  through 
routine  pharmacovigilance  including  cumulative  analysis  in  PSUR  and  a  multinational,  multi-database 
drug utilisation study of inhaled glycopyrronium in Europe. Taking the above-information into account, 
the CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
-  Post-authorisation  safety  study  on  cardio-  and  cerebrovascular  outcomes  (Multinational  database 
cohort study to assess adverse cardiovascular outcomes in association with inhaled glycopyrronium in 
Europe)  
- Drug utilisation study (Multinational, multi-database drug utilisation study of inhaled glycopyrronium 
in Europe).

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The  benefits  of  NVA237  in  the  once-daily  maintenance  bronchodilator  treatment  to  relieve  symptoms 
of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were adequately documented in a large 
non-clinical and clinical programme. 
Clinically  relevant  differences  to  placebo  were  shown  for  lung  function  measurements,  moderate  and 
severe  exacerbation  rates  and  to  a  lesser  extent  also  for  symptomatic  endpoints.  In  both  pivotal 
studies,  NVA237  showed  statistically  significant  improvement  in  trough  FEV1  at  week  12  compared 
with placebo. The treatment difference was 108 mL (95% CI: 78.5-136.8 mL) in Study A2304 and 97 
mL (95% CI: 64.6-130.2 mL) in Study A2303. 
Efficacy was also shown to be at least on par with tiotropium, the only currently marketed long-acting 
muscarinic antagonist. 
Moreover, the efficacy shown in the short-term (12 weeks) appears to be maintained in the long-term 
(up to 52 weeks). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The  efficacy  of  the  selected  dose  regimen  (50  μg  once  daily)  has  been  clearly  demonstrated.  In 
addition, the once daily regimen offers a benefit regarding patient compliance. However, the additional 
dose-finding study (A2208) seems to suggest that a twice daily regimen (such as 25 μg b.i.d. or 50 μg 
b.i.d.)  could  be  more  efficacious.  In  order  to  follow  up,  the  CHMP  requested  a  post-authorisation 
clinical  study  to  further  characterise  the  optimal  dosing  schedule  for  NVA237.  “Optimal  dosing 
schedule”  was  considered  as  important  missing  information  at  the  time  of  Opinion  and  should  be 
added in the RMP.  
The  effects  on  patient-reported  symptomatic  measures  (SGQR  and  TDI)  were  not  very  large  as  the 
clinically significant differences expected to be found by the Applicant were either not met in SGQR in 
any  of  the  pivotal  studies  or  not  met  in  TDI  (Study  A2303)  )  or  borderline  achieved  (Study  A2304). 
Both  studies  also  document  a  modest,  but  relevant  decrease  in  frequency  of  moderate  and  severe 
COPD  exacerbations  and  improvement  in  terms  of  use  of  rescue  medication  in  NVA  237-treated 
patients  compared  to  placebo.  However,  the  totality  of  the  efficacy  data  from  the  pivotal  studies 
(spirometry,  exacerbations  and  patient-reported  outcomes,  use  of  rescue  medication  etc.)  are 
considered to reflect a clinically relevant benefit in COPD patients. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The adverse events observed in the clinical programme are considered to be typical of a moderately to 
severely affected COPD population. As expected from the pharmacological profile of NVA237 (an anti-
muscarinic agent), a number of anticholinergic adverse events appeared to be causally related to the 
use  of  NVA237,  in  particular  dry  mouth.  However,  for  most  of  the  adverse  events  thought  to  be 
anticholinergic, the incidences in excess of placebo were low.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
A  higher  frequency  of  adverse  events  of  atrial  fibrillation  in  NVA237-treated  patients  was  observed. 
However,  when  looking  at  adjudicated  ECG  recordings,  the  number  of  patients  with  a  new  or 
worsening  ECG  finding  of  atrial  fibrillation  was  similar  for  NVA237  and  placebo.  Atrial  fibrillation  is 
considered as a potential risk in the risk management plan and included in the SmPC. 
Considering  the  potential  risk  of  adverse  cardiovascular  (CV)  outcomes  related  to  the  mechanism  of 
action of anticholinergic quaternary ammonium compounds and the recent concerns on cardiovascular 
safety of same class products, adverse CV outcomes should be followed closely in the post-marketing 
setting.  Consequently,  the  CHMP  requested  the  conduct  of  a  PASS  to  monitor  these  outcomes  post-
marketing; this is included in the risk management plan. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The treatment difference in favour of NVA237 for the primary efficacy endpoint, FEV1 at week 12, was 
approximately  100  mL.  This  difference  can  be  considered  clinically  relevant.  The  relevance  of  the 
finding  was  supported  by  the  generally  consistent  superiority  of  NVA237  to  placebo  on  most  other 
efficacy  endpoints.  Statistically  significant  improvement  compared  to  placebo  was  also  observed  for 
patient-reported  symptomatic  endpoints,  although  the  treatment  effect  was  not  large.  Looking  at  the 
totality  of  the  efficacy  data  (spirometry,  exacerbations  and  patient-reported  outcomes,  use  of  rescue 
medication  etc.),  the  CHMP  concludes  that  the  benefit  of  NVA  237  in  COPD  is  modest,  but  clinically 
relevant. 
The  effects  were  similar  to  those  of  the  long-acting  muscarinic  antagonist  tiotropium.  The  adverse 
events  observed  are  typical  of  a  moderately  to  severely  affected  COPD  population.  As  expected  from 
the  pharmacological  profile  of  NVA237,  a  number  of  anticholinergic  adverse  events  appear  to  be 
causally related to the use of NVA237, in particular dry mouth, but generally the excess numbers are 
low. 
Considering  the  potential  risk  of  adverse  cardiovascular  (CV)  outcomes  related  to  the  mechanism  of 
action of anticholinergic quaternary ammonium compounds and the concerns on cardiovascular safety 
of same class products, adverse CV outcomes will be followed up as explained above. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The  favourable  effects  described  above  are  considered  important  in  that  NVA237  improved  objective 
lung function measurements compared to placebo and that these changes were accompanied by other 
improvements,  including  symptomatic  improvements,  in  patients  with  COPD.  Since  the  overall  safety 
and tolerability profile is considered benign, the benefit-risk balance is considered positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The  efficacy  of  NVA237  50  µg  once  daily  over  placebo  in  terms  of  improvement  in  lung  function 
measurements and relevant measures of symptomatic benefit has been documented in the two pivotal 
studies  and  is  supported  by  a  phase  II  study  and  a  further  phase  III  study.  The  currently  proposed 
once daily regimen provides a clinical benefit on par with an already approved product within the same 
class  and  is  associated  with  a  relatively  unproblematic  safety  and  tolerability  profile.  In  addition,  the 
once daily regimen offers a benefit regarding patient compliance. 
No major concerns were identified with regard to the safety of NVA237. The adverse events observed 
were  typical  of  a  moderately  to  severely  affected  COPD  population.  As  expected  from  the

pharmacological profile of NVA237, a number of anticholinergic adverse events appeared to be causally 
related to the use of NVA237, in particular dry mouth, but generally the excess numbers were low. 
Therefore, on the basis of quality, safety and efficacy data submitted, the CHMP considers that there is 
a favourable benefit-to-risk balance for NVA237.

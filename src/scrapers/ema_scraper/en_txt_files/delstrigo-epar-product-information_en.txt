CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1  Therapeutic indications
Delstrigo is indicated for the treatment of adults infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1
(HIV-1) without past or present evidence of resistance to the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors (NNRTI) class, lamivudine, or tenofovir (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).
Delstrigo is also indicated for the treatment of adolescents aged 12 years and older weighing at least
35 kg who are infected with HIV-1 without past or present evidence of resistance to the NNRTI class,
lamivudine, or tenofovir and who have experienced toxicities which preclude the use of other
regimens that do not contain tenofovir disoproxil (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).
4.2  Posology and method of administration
Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of HIV infection.
Posology
The recommended dose of Delstrigo is one 100/300/245 mg tablet taken orally once daily with or
without food.
Dose adjustment
If Delstrigo is co-administered with rifabutin, the doravirine dose should be increased to 100 mg twice
daily. This is achieved by adding one 100 mg tablet of doravirine (as a single agent), to be taken
approximately 12 hours apart from the dose of Delstrigo (see section 4.5).
Co-administration of doravirine with other moderate CYP3A inducers has not been evaluated, but
decreased doravirine concentrations are expected. If co-administration with other moderate CYP3A
inducers (e.g., dabrafenib, lesinurad, bosentan, thioridazine, nafcillin, modafinil, telotristat ethyl)
cannot be avoided, one 100 mg tablet of doravirine should be taken daily, approximately 12 hours
after the dose of Delstrigo (see section 4.5).
2
Missed dose
If the patient misses a dose of Delstrigo within 12 hours of the time it is usually taken, the patient
should take Delstrigo as soon as possible and resume the normal dosing schedule. If a patient misses a
dose of Delstrigo by more than 12 hours, the patient should not take the missed dose and instead take
the next dose at the regularly scheduled time. The patient should not take 2 doses at one time.
Special populations
Elderly
There are limited data available on the use of doravirine, lamivudine, and tenofovir disoproxil in
patients aged 65 years and over. There is no evidence that elderly patients require a different dose than
younger adult patients (see section 5.2). Special care is advised in this age group due to age associated
changes such as decreases in renal function (see section 4.4).
Renal impairment
No dose adjustment of Delstrigo is required in patients with estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl)
≥ 50 mL/min.
Delstrigo should not be initiated in patients with estimated CrCl < 50 mL/min (see sections 4.4
and 5.2). Delstrigo should be discontinued if estimated CrCl declines below 50 mL/min (see
section 4.4). Patients with moderate or severe renal impairment require a dose interval adjustment of
lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil that cannot be achieved with the combination tablet (see
sections 4.4 and 5.2).
Hepatic impairment
No dose adjustment of doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil is required in patients with mild
(Child-Pugh Class A) or moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) hepatic impairment. Doravirine has not been
studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C). It is not known whether the
exposure to doravirine will increase in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Therefore, caution is
advised when doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil is administered to patients with severe
hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).
Paediatric population
Safety and efficacy of Delstrigo in children aged less than 12 years or weighing less than 35 kg have
not been established. No data are available.
Method of administration
Delstrigo must be taken orally, once daily with or without food and swallowed whole (see section 5.2).
4.3  Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin
Co-administration with medicinal products that are strong cytochrome P450 CYP3A enzyme inducers
is contraindicated as significant decreases in doravirine plasma concentrations are expected to occur,
which may decrease the effectiveness of Delstrigo (see sections 4.4 and 4.5). These medicinal
products include, but are not limited to the following:
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
rifampicin, rifapentine
St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum)
mitotane
enzalutamide

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use
NNRTI substitutions and use of doravirine
Doravirine has not been evaluated in patients with previous virologic failure to any other antiretroviral
therapy. NNRTI-associated mutations detected at screening were part of exclusion criteria in the
Phase 2b/3-studies. A breakpoint for a reduction in susceptibility, yielded by various NNRTI
substitutions, that is associated with a reduction in clinical efficacy has not been established (see
section 5.1). There is not sufficient clinical evidence to support the use of doravirine in patients
infected with HIV-1 with evidence of resistance to the NNRTI class.
Severe acute exacerbation of hepatitis B in patients co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV
All patients with HIV-1 should be tested for the presence of hepatitis B virus (HBV) before initiating
antiretroviral therapy.
Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B (e.g., liver decompensated and liver failure) have been
reported in patients who are co-infected with HIV-1 and HBV, and have discontinued lamivudine or
tenofovir disoproxil, two of the components of Delstrigo. Patients who are co-infected with HIV-1 and
HBV should be closely monitored with both clinical and laboratory follow-up for at least several
months after stopping treatment with Delstrigo. If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis B therapy
may be warranted, especially in patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, since post-treatment
exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation and liver failure.
New onset or worsening renal impairment
Renal impairment, including cases of acute renal failure and Fanconi syndrome (renal tubular injury
with severe hypophosphataemia), has been reported with the use of tenofovir disoproxil, a component
of Delstrigo.
Delstrigo should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic medicinal products (e.g.,
high-dose or multiple nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products [NSAIDs]) (see section 4.5).
Cases of acute renal failure after initiation of high-dose or multiple NSAIDs have been reported in
HIV-infected patients with risk factors for renal dysfunction who appeared stable on tenofovir
disoproxil. Some patients required hospitalisation and renal replacement therapy. Alternatives to
NSAIDs should be considered, if needed, in patients at risk for renal dysfunction.
Persistent or worsening bone pain, pain in extremities, fractures, and/or muscular pain or weakness
may be manifestations of proximal renal tubulopathy and should prompt an evaluation of renal
function in at risk patients.
It is recommended that estimated CrCl be assessed in all patients prior to initiating therapy and as
clinically appropriate during therapy with Delstrigo. In patients at risk of renal dysfunction, including
patients who have previously experienced renal events while receiving adefovir dipivoxil, it is
recommended that estimated CrCl, serum phosphorus, urine glucose, and urine protein be assessed
prior to initiation of Delstrigo and more frequent renal function monitoring should be assessed as
appropriate per the patient’s medical condition during Delstrigo therapy.
Lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil are primarily excreted by the kidney. Delstrigo should be
discontinued if estimated CrCl declines below 50 mL/min as dose interval adjustment required for
lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil cannot be achieved with the fixed dose combination tablet (see
section 4.2).
4
Bone loss and mineralisation defects
Bone mineral density
In clinical trials in HIV-1 infected adults, tenofovir disoproxil was associated with slightly greater
decreases in bone mineral density (BMD) and increases in biochemical markers of bone metabolism,
suggesting increased bone turnover relative to comparators. Serum parathyroid hormone levels and
1,25 Vitamin D levels were also higher in subjects receiving tenofovir disoproxil. In other studies
(prospective and cross-sectional), the most pronounced decreases in BMD were seen in patients
treated with tenofovir disoproxil as part of a regimen containing a boosted protease inhibitor.
Bone abnormalities (infrequently contributing to fractures) may be associated with proximal renal
tubulopathy.
The effects of tenofovir disoproxil associated changes in BMD and biochemical markers on long-term
bone health and future fracture risk are unknown. Assessment of BMD should be considered for
HIV-1 infected adult patients who have a history of pathologic bone fracture or other risk factors for
osteoporosis or bone loss. Although the effect of supplementation with calcium and Vitamin D was
not studied, such supplementation may be beneficial in all patients. If bone abnormalities are
suspected, then appropriate consultation should be obtained.
Mineralisation defects
Cases of osteomalacia associated with proximal renal tubulopathy, manifested as bone pain or pain in
extremities and which may contribute to fractures, have been reported in association with the use of
tenofovir disoproxil . Arthralgias and muscle pain or weakness have also been reported in cases of
proximal renal tubulopathy. Hypophosphataemia and osteomalacia secondary to proximal renal
tubulopathy should be considered in patients at risk of renal dysfunction who present with persistent or
worsening bone or muscle symptoms while receiving products containing tenofovir disoproxil (see
section 4.4).
Co-administration with other antiviral products
Doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil must not be co-administered with other medicinal products
containing lamivudine, or with medicinal products containing tenofovir disoproxil, or tenofovir
alafenamide, or with adefovir dipivoxil (see section 4.5). Doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil
should not be administered with doravirine unless needed for dose adjustment (e.g., with rifabutin)
(see sections 4.2 and 4.5).
Use with CYP3A inducers
Caution should be given to prescribing doravirine with medicinal products that may reduce the
exposure of doravirine (see sections 4.3 and 4.5).
Immune reactivation syndrome
Immune reactivation syndrome has been reported in patients treated with combination antiretroviral
therapy. During the initial phase of combination antiretroviral treatment, patients whose immune
system responds may develop an inflammatory response to indolent or residual opportunistic
infections (such as Mycobacterium avium infection, cytomegalovirus, Pneumocystis jirovecii
pneumonia [PCP], or tuberculosis), which may necessitate further evaluation and treatment.
Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease, autoimmune hepatitis, polymyositis, and Guillain-
Barré syndrome) have also been reported to occur in the setting of immune reactivation; however, the
time to onset is more variable and can occur many months after initiation of treatment.
5
Lactose
Delstrigo contains lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose
intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal
product.
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
Delstrigo is a complete regimen for the treatment of HIV-1 infection; therefore, Delstrigo should not
be administered with other antiretroviral medicinal products. Information regarding potential
medicinal product interactions with other antiretroviral medicinal products is not provided.
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults.
Delstrigo contains doravirine, lamivudine, and tenofovir disoproxil, therefore any interactions
identified for these individually are relevant to Delstrigo and are presented in Table 1.
Effects of other medicinal products on doravirine, lamivudine, and tenofovir disoproxil
Doravirine
Doravirine is primarily metabolised by CYP3A, and medicinal products that induce or inhibit CYP3A
are expected to affect the clearance of doravirine (see section 5.2). Doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir
disoproxil should not be co-administered with medicinal products that are strong CYP3A enzyme
inducers as significant decreases in doravirine plasma concentrations are expected to occur, which
may decrease the effectiveness of doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil (see sections 4.3
and 5.2).
Co-administration with the moderate CYP3A inducer rifabutin decreased doravirine concentrations
(see Table 1). When Delstrigo is co-administered with rifabutin, a 100 mg dose of doravirine should
be given daily, approximately 12 hours after doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil dose (see
section 4.2).
Co-administration of doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil with other moderate CYP3A inducers
has not been evaluated, but decreased doravirine concentrations are expected. If co-administration
with other moderate CYP3A inducers (e.g., debrafenib, lesinurad, bosentan, thioridazine, nafcillin,
modafinil, telotristat ethyl) cannot be avoided, a 100 mg dose of doravirine should be administered
daily, approximately 12 hours after the administration of doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil
dose (see section 4.2).
Co-administration of doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disproxil and medicinal products that are
inhibitors of CYP3A may result in increased plasma concentrations of doravirine. However, no dose
adjustment is needed when doravirine is co-administered with CYP3A inhibitors.
Lamivudine
Because lamivudine is primarily eliminated by the kidneys through a combination of glomerular
filtration and active tubular secretion (see section 5.2), co-administration of
doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil with medicinal products that reduce renal function or
compete for active tubular secretion may increase serum concentrations of lamivudine.
Tenofovir disoproxil
Because tenofovir is primarily eliminated by the kidneys through a combination of glomerular
filtration and active tubular secretion (see section 5.2), co-administration of
doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil with medicinal products that reduce renal function or
compete for active tubular secretion via OAT1, OAT3 or MRP4 may increase serum concentrations of
tenofovir.
6
Due to the tenofovir disoproxil component of doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil, use of the
product should be avoided with concurrent or recent use of nephrotoxic medicinal products. Some
examples include, but are not limited to, acyclovir, cidofovir, ganciclovir, valacyclovir, valganciclovir,
aminoglycosides (e.g., gentamicin), and high-dose or multiple NSAIDs (see section 4.4).
Effects of doravirine, lamivudine, and tenofovir disoproxil on other medicinal products
Doravirine
Doravirine at a dose of 100 mg once daily is not likely to have a clinically relevant effect on the
plasma concentrations of medicinal products that are dependent on transport proteins for absorption
and/or elimination or that are metabolised by CYP enzymes.
However, co-administration of doravirine and the sensitive CYP3A substrate midazolam resulted in a
18 % decrease in midazolam exposure, suggesting that doravirine may be a weak CYP3A inducer.
Therefore, caution should be used when co-administering doravirine with medicinal products that are
sensitive CYP3A substrates that also have a narrow therapeutic window (e.g., tacrolimus and
sirolimus).
Lamivudine
Lamivudine does not inhibit or induce CYP enzymes.
Tenofovir
Based on the results of in vitro experiments and the known elimination pathway of tenofovir, the
potential for CYP-mediated interactions involving tenofovir with other medicinal products is low.
Interaction table
Table 1 shows the established and other potential medicinal product interactions with the individual
components of Delstrigo but is not all inclusive (increase is indicated as ↑, decrease is indicated as ,
and no change as ). For potential medicinal product interactions with tenofovir disoproxil or

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of doravirine in pregnant women. A large amount
of data on pregnant women (more than 3 000 outcomes from first trimester) taking the individual
active component lamivudine in combination with other antiretrovirals indicates no malformative
toxicity. A moderate amount of data on pregnant women (between 300-1 000 pregnancy outcomes)
indicate no malformations or foetal/neonatal toxicity associated with tenofovir disoproxil.
Antiretroviral pregnancy registry
To monitor maternal-foetal outcomes in patients exposed to antiretroviral medicinal products while
pregnant, an Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry has been established. Physicians are encouraged to
register patients in this registry.
Animal studies with doravirine do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
Animal studies with tenofovir disoproxil do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects of tenofovir
disoproxil with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).
Animal studies with lamivudine showed an increase in early embryonic deaths in rabbits but not in rats
(see section 5.3). Placental transfer of lamivudine has been shown to occur in humans. Lamivudine
may inhibit cellular DNA replication (see section 5.3). The clinical relevance of this finding is
unknown.
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Delstrigo during pregnancy.
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether doravirine is excreted in human milk. Available
pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of doravirine in milk (see
section 5.3).
Lamivudine has been identified in breast-fed newborns/infants of treated women. Based on more than
200 mother/child pairs treated for HIV, serum concentrations of lamivudine in breast-fed infants of
mothers treated for HIV are very low (< 4 % of maternal serum concentrations) and progressively
16
decrease to undetectable levels when breast-fed infants reach 24 weeks of age. There are no data
available on the safety of lamivudine when administered to babies less than three months old.
Tenofovir is excreted in human milk. There is insufficient information on the effects of tenofovir in
newborns/infants.
It is recommended that women living with HIV do not breast-feed their infants in order to avoid
transmission of HIV.
Fertility
No human data on the effect of Delstrigo on fertility are available. Animal studies do not indicate
harmful effects of doravirine, lamivudine, or tenofovir disoproxil on fertility at exposure levels higher
than the exposure in humans at the recommended clinical dose (see section 5.3).
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Delstrigo has a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be informed
that fatigue, dizziness, and somnolence have been reported during treatment with Delstrigo (see
section 4.8). This should be considered when assessing a patient's ability to drive or operate
machinery.
4.8  Undesirable effects

Immune reactivation syndrome  
In HIV-infected patients with severe immune deficiency at the time of initiation of combination
antiretroviral therapy (CART), an inflammatory reaction to asymptomatic or residual opportunistic
infections may arise. Autoimmune disorders (such as Graves’ disease and autoimmune hepatitis) have
also been reported; however, the reported time to onset is more variable and these events can occur
many months after initiation of treatment (see section 4.4).
Lactic acidosis 
Cases of lactic acidosis have been reported with tenofovir disoproxil alone or in combination with
other antiretrovirals. Patients with predisposing factors such as patients with decompensated liver
disease, or patients receiving concomitant medicinal products known to induce lactic acidosis are at
increased risk of experiencing severe lactic acidosis during tenofovir disoproxil treatment, including
fatal outcomes.
Paediatric population
The safety of doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil was evaluated in 45 HIV-1 infected
virologically suppressed or treatment-naïve paediatric patients 12 to less than 18 years of age through
Week 48 in an open-label trial (IMPAACT 2014 (Protocol 027)). The safety profile in paediatric
subjects was similar to that in adults. 
19
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system
listed in Appendix V.
4.9  Overdose
Doravirine
There is no information on potential acute symptoms and signs of overdose with doravirine.
Lamivudine
Because a negligible amount of lamivudine was removed via (4-hour) haemodialysis, continuous
ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, and automated peritoneal dialysis, it is not known if continuous
haemodialysis would provide clinical benefit in a lamivudine overdose event.
Tenofovir disoproxil
Tenofovir disoproxil is efficiently removed by haemodialysis with an extraction coefficient of
approximately 54 %. Following a single 245 mg dose of tenofovir disoproxil, a 4-hour haemodialysis
session removed approximately 10 % of the administered tenofovir dose.
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, ATC code: J05AR24
Mechanism of action
Doravirine
Doravirine is a pyridinone non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor of HIV-1 and inhibits HIV-1
replication by non-competitive inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT). Doravirine does not
inhibit the human cellular DNA polymerases α, ß, and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ.
Lamivudine
Lamivudine is a nucleoside analogue. Intracellularly, lamivudine is phosphorylated to its active
5´- triphosphate metabolite, lamivudine triphosphate (3TC-TP). The principal mode of action of
3TC-TP is inhibition of RT via DNA chain termination after incorporation of the nucleotide analogue.
Tenofovir disoproxil 
Tenofovir disoproxil is an acyclic nucleoside phosphonate diester analog of adenosine
monophosphate. Tenofovir disoproxil requires initial diester hydrolysis for conversion to tenofovir and
subsequent phosphorylations by cellular enzymes to form tenofovir diphosphate. Tenofovir
diphosphate inhibits the activity of HIV-1 RT by competing with the natural substrate deoxyadenosine
5´-triphosphate and, after incorporation into DNA, by DNA chain termination. Tenofovir diphosphate
is a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases α, β, and mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ.
Antiviral activity in cell culture
Doravirine
Doravirine exhibited an EC50 value of 12.0±4.4 nM against wild-type laboratory strains of HIV-1
when tested in the presence of 100 % normal human serum using MT4-GFP reporter cells. Doravirine
demonstrated antiviral activity against a broad panel of primary HIV-1 isolates (A, A1, AE, AG, B,
20
BF, C, D, G, H) with EC50 values ranging from 1.2 nM to 10.0 nM. The antiviral activity of doravirine
was not antagonistic when combined with lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil.
Lamivudine
The antiviral activity of lamivudine against HIV-1 was assessed in a number of cell lines including
monocytes and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) using standard susceptibility assays.
EC50 values were in the range of 0.003 to 15 microM (1 microM = 0.23 micrograms per mL). The
median EC50 values of lamivudine were 60 nM (range: 20 to 70 nM), 35 nM (range: 30 to 40 nM),
30 nM (range: 20 to 90 nM), 20 nM (range: 3 to 40 nM), 30 nM (range: 1 to 60 nM), 30 nM (range:
20 to 70 nM), 30 nM (range: 3 to 70 nM), and 30 nM (range: 20 to 90 nM) against HIV-1 clades A-G
and group O viruses (n = 3 except n = 2 for clade B) respectively. Ribavirin (50 microM) used in the
treatment of chronic HCV infection decreased the anti-HIV-1 activity of lamivudine by 3.5-fold in
MT-4 cells.
Tenofovir disoproxil 
The antiviral activity of tenofovir against laboratory and clinical isolates of HIV-1 was assessed in
T lymphoblastoid cell lines, primary monocyte/macrophage cells and peripheral blood lymphocytes.
The EC50 values for tenofovir were in the range of 0.04-8.5 microM. Tenofovir displayed antiviral
activity in cell culture against HIV-1 clades A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and O (EC50 values ranged from
0.5-2.2 microM).
Resistance
In cell culture
Doravirine
Doravirine-resistant strains were selected in cell culture starting from wild-type HIV-1 of different
origins and subtypes, as well as NNRTI-resistant HIV-1. Observed emergent amino acid substitutions
in RT included: V106A, V106M, V106I, V108I, F227L, F227C, F227I, F227V, H221Y, M230I,
L234I, P236L, and Y318F. The V106A, V106M, V108I, H221Y, F227C, M230I, P236L, and Y318F
substitutions conferred 3.4-fold to 70-fold reductions in susceptibility to doravirine. Y318F in
combination with V106A, V106M, V108I, and F227C conferred greater decreases in susceptibility to
doravirine than Y318F alone, which conferred a 10-fold reduction in susceptibility to doravirine.
Common NNRTI-resistant mutations (K103N, Y181C) were not selected in the in vitro study. V106A
(yielding a fold change of around 19) appeared as an initial substitution in subtype B virus, and
V106A or M in subtype A and C virus. Subsequently F227(L/C/V) or L234I emerged in addition to
V106 substitutions (double mutants yielding a fold change of > 100).
Lamivudine
Lamivudine-resistant variants of HIV-1 have been selected in cell culture and in subjects treated with
lamivudine. Genotypic analysis showed that the resistance was due to a specific amino acid
substitution in the HIV-1 RT at codon 184 changing the methionine to either isoleucine or valine
(M184V/I).
Tenofovir disoproxil 
HIV-1 isolates selected by tenofovir expressed a K65R substitution in HIV-1 RT and showed a
2-4 fold reduction in susceptibility to tenofovir. In addition, a K70E substitution in HIV-1 RT has been
selected by tenofovir and results in low-level reduced susceptibility to abacavir, emtricitabine,
lamivudine, and tenofovir.
In clinical trials
Treatment-naïve adult subjects
Doravirine
The Phase 3 studies, DRIVE-FORWARD and DRIVE-AHEAD, included previously untreated
patients (n = 747) where the following NNRTI substitutions were part of exclusion criteria: L100I,
K101E, K101P, K103N, K103S, V106A, V106I, V106M, V108I, E138A, E138G, E138K, E138Q,

M230I, M230L, P225H, F227C, F227L, F227V.
The following de novo resistance was seen in the resistance analysis subset (subjects with HIV-1 RNA
greater than 400 copies per mL at virologic failure or at early study discontinuation and having
resistance data).

Virologically suppressed adult subjects
The DRIVE-SHIFT study included virologically suppressed patients (N=670) with no history of
treatment failure (see section, Clinical experience). A documented absence of genotypic resistance
(prior to starting first therapy) to doravirine, lamivudine, and tenofovir was part of the inclusion
criteria for patients who switched from a PI- or INI-based regimen.  Exclusionary NNRTI
substitutions were those listed above (DRIVE-FORWARD and DRIVE-AHEAD), with the exception
of substitutions RT K103N, G190A and Y181C (accepted in DRIVE-SHIFT).  Documentation of
pre-treatment resistance genotyping was not required for patients who switched from a NNRTI-based
regimen.
In the DRIVE-SHIFT clinical trial, no subjects developed genotypic or phenotypic resistance to DOR,
3TC, or TDF during the initial 48 weeks (immediate switch, N=447) or 24 weeks (delayed switch,
N=209) of treatment with Delstrigo.  One subject developed RT M184M/I mutation and phenotypic
resistance to 3TC and FTC during treatment with their baseline regimen.  None of the 24 subjects (11
in the immediate switch group, 13 in the delayed switch group) with baseline NNRTI mutations (RT
K103N, G190A, or Y181C) experienced virologic failure through Week 48, or at time of
discontinuation.
Paediatric subjects
In the IMPAACT 2014 (Protocol 027) clinical trial, no subject who was virologically suppressed at
baseline met the criteria for resistance analysis. One treatment-naïve subject who met the
protocol-defined virologic failure criteria (defined as 2 consecutive plasma HIV-1 RNA test results
≥200 copies/mL) at or after Week 24 was evaluated for the development of resistance; no emergence
of genotypic or phenotypic resistance to doravirine, lamivudine or tenofovir was detected.
22
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cross-resistance
No significant cross-resistance has been demonstrated between doravirine-resistant HIV-1 variants and
lamivudine/emtricitabine or tenofovir or between lamivudine- or tenofovir-resistant variants and
doravirine.
Doravirine
Doravirine has been evaluated in a limited number of patients with NNRTI resistance (K103N n = 7,
G190A n = 1); all patients were suppressed to < 40 copies/mL at Week 48. A breakpoint for a
reduction in susceptibility, yielded by various NNRTI substitutions, that is associated with a reduction
in clinical efficacy has not been established.
Laboratory strains of HIV-1 harbouring the common NNRTI-associated mutations K103N, Y181C, or
K103N/Y181C substitutions in RT exhibit less than a 3-fold decrease in susceptibility to doravirine
compared to wild-type virus when evaluated in the presence of 100 % normal human serum. In in vitro
studies, doravirine was able to suppress the following NNRTI-associated substitutions; K103N,
Y181C, and G190A under clinically relevant concentrations.
A panel of 96 diverse clinical isolates containing NNRTI-associated mutations was evaluated for
susceptibility to doravirine in the presence of 10 % foetal bovine serum. Clinical isolates containing
the Y188L substitution or V106 substitutions in combination with A98G, H221Y, P225H, F227C or
Y318F showed a greater than 100-fold reduced susceptibility to doravirine. Other substitutions yielded
a fold change of 5-10 (G190S (5.7); K103N/P225H (7.9), V108I/Y181C (6.9), Y181V (5.1)). The
clinical relevance of a 5-10 fold change reduction in susceptibility is unknown.
Treatment emergent doravirine resistance associated substitutions may confer cross-resistance to
efavirenz, rilpivirine, nevirapine, and etravirine. Of the 8 subjects who developed high level doravirine
resistance in the pivotal studies, 6 had phenotypic resistance to EFV and nevirapine, 3 to rilpivirine,
and 3 had partial resistance to etravirine based on the Monogram Phenosense assay.
Lamivudine
Cross-resistance has been observed among NRTIs. The M184I/V lamivudine resistance substitution
confers resistance to emtricitabine. Lamivudine-resistant HIV-1 mutants were also cross resistant to
didanosine (ddI). In some subjects treated with zidovudine plus didanosine, isolates resistant to
multiple RT inhibitors, including lamivudine, have emerged.
Tenofovir disoproxil 
Cross-resistance has been observed among NRTIs. The K65R substitution in HIV-1 RT selected by
tenofovir is also selected in some HIV-1 infected patients treated with abacavir or didanosine. HIV-1
isolates with the K65R substitution also showed reduced susceptibility to emtricitabine and
lamivudine. Therefore, cross-resistance among these NRTIs may occur in patients whose virus
harbours the K65R substitution. The K70E substitution selected clinically by tenofovir disoproxil
results in reduced susceptibility to abacavir, didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, and tenofovir.
HIV-1 isolates from patients (n = 20) whose HIV-1 expressed a mean of 3 zidovudine associated RT
amino acid substitutions (M41L, D67N, K70R, L210W, T215Y/F, or K219Q/E/N) showed a 3.1-fold
decrease in the susceptibility to tenofovir. Subjects whose virus expressed an L74V RT substitution
without zidovudine resistance-associated substitutions (n = 8) had reduced response to tenofovir
disoproxil. Limited data are available for patients whose virus expressed a Y115F substitution (n = 3),
Q151M substitution (n = 2), or T69 insertion (n = 4) in HIV-1 RT, all of whom had a reduced
response in clinical trials.
Clinical experience
Treatment-naïve adult subjects
The efficacy of doravirine is based on the analyses of 96-week data from two randomised, multicentre,
double-blind, active controlled Phase 3 trials, (DRIVE-FORWARD and DRIVE-AHEAD) in
23
antiretroviral treatment-naïve, HIV-1 infected subjects (n = 1494). Refer to Resistance section for
NNRTI substitutions that were part of exclusion criteria.
In DRIVE-FORWARD, 766 subjects were randomised and received at least 1 dose of either
doravirine 100 mg or darunavir + ritonavir 800+100 mg once daily, each in combination with
emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (FTC/TDF) or abacavir/lamivudine (ABC/3TC) selected by the
investigator. At baseline, the median age of subjects was 33 years (range 18 to 69 years), 86 % had
CD4+ T cell count greater than 200 cells per mm3, 84 % were male, 27 % were non-white, 4 % had
hepatitis B and/or C virus co-infection, 10 % had a history of AIDS, 20 % had HIV-1 RNA greater
than 100 000 copies per mL, 13 % received ABC/3TC and 87 % received FTC/TDF; these
characteristics were similar between treatment groups.
In DRIVE-AHEAD, 728 subjects were randomised and received at least 1 dose of either
doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil 100/300/245 mg (DOR/3TC/TDF) or
efavirenz/emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil (EFV/FTC/TDF) once daily. At baseline, the median age
of subjects was 31 years (range 18-70 years), 85 % were male, 52 % were non-white, 3 % had
hepatitis B or C co-infection, 14 % had a history of AIDS, 21 % had HIV-1 RNA > 100 000 copies per
mL, and 12 % had CD4+ T cell count < 200 cells per mm3; these characteristics were similar between
treatment groups.
Week 48 and 96 outcomes for DRIVE-FORWARD and DRIVE-AHEAD are provided in Table 4. The
doravirine-based regimens demonstrated consistent efficacy across demographic and baseline
prognostic factors.

Virologically suppressed adult subjects
The efficacy of switching from a baseline regimen consisting of two nucleoside reverse transcriptase
inhibitors in combination with a ritonavir- or cobicistat-boosted PI, or cobicistat-boosted elvitegravir,
or an NNRTI to Delstrigo was evaluated in a randomised, open-label trial (DRIVE-SHIFT), in
virologically suppressed HIV-1 infected adults. Subjects must have been virologically suppressed
(HIV-1 RNA < 40 copies/mL) on their baseline regimen for at least 6 months prior to trial entry, with
no history of virologic failure, and a documented absence of RT substitutions conferring resistance to
doravirine, lamivudine and tenofovir (see section, Resistance). Subjects were randomised to either
switch to Delstrigo at baseline [N= 447, Immediate Switch Group (ISG)], or stay on their baseline
regimen until Week 24, at which point they switched to Delstrigo [N= 223, Delayed Switch Group
(DSG)]. At baseline, the median age of subjects was 43 years, 16 % were female, and 24 % were non-
white.
In the DRIVE-SHIFT trial, an immediate switch to Delstrigo was demonstrated to be non-inferior at
Week 48 compared to continuation of the baseline regimen at Week 24 as assessed by the proportion
of subjects with HIV-1 RNA < 40 copies/mL. Treatment results are shown in Table 5. Consistent
results were seen for the comparison at study Week 24 in each treatment group.

Baseline regimen = ritonavir or cobicistat-boosted PI (specifically atazanavir, darunavir, or lopinavir), or
cobicistat-boosted elvitegravir, or NNRTI (specifically efavirenz, nevirapine, or rilpivirine), each 
administered with two NRTIs.
Discontinuation due to adverse events
In DRIVE-AHEAD, a lower proportion of subjects who discontinued due to an adverse event by
Week 48 was seen for the Delstrigo group (3.0 %) compared with the EFV/FTC/TDF group (6.6 %).
Paediatric population
The efficacy of DOR/3TC/TDF was evaluated in an open-label, single-arm trial in HIV-1 infected
paediatric patients 12 to less than 18 years of age (IMPAACT 2014 (Protocol 027)). 
At baseline, the median age of subjects was 15 years (range: 12 to 17), 58% were female, 78% were
Asian and 22% were Black, and the median CD4+ T-cell count was 713 cells per mm3 (range: 84 to
1,397). After switching to DOR/3TC/TDF, 95% (41/43) of virologically-suppressed subjects remained
26
 
suppressed (HIV-1 RNA < 50 copies/mL) at Week 24 and 93% (40/43) remained suppressed (HIV-1
RNA < 50 copies/mL) at Week 48.
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with
Delstrigo in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in treatment of human immunodeficiency
virus-1 (HIV-1) infection. See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use.
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties
Single-dose administration of one doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil tablet to healthy subjects
(N = 24) under fasted conditions provided comparable exposures of doravirine, lamivudine, and
tenofovir to administration of doravirine tablets (100 mg) plus lamivudine tablets (300 mg) plus
tenofovir disoproxil tablets (245 mg). The administration of a single Delstrigo tablet with a high-fat
meal to healthy subjects resulted in a 26 % increase in doravirine C24, while AUC and Cmax were not
significantly affected. Lamivudine Cmax decreased by 19 % with a high fat meal, while AUC was not
significantly affected. Tenofovir Cmax decreased by 12 % and AUC increased by 27 % with a high fat
meal. These differences in pharmacokinetics are not clinically relevant.
Doravirine
The pharmacokinetics of doravirine were studied in healthy subjects and HIV-1-infected subjects.
Doravirine pharmacokinetics are similar in healthy subjects and HIV-1-infected subjects. Steady state
was generally achieved by Day 2 of once daily dosing, with accumulation ratios of 1.2 to 1.4 for
AUC0-24, Cmax, and C24. Doravirine steady state pharmacokinetics following administration of 100 mg
once daily to HIV-1 infected subjects, based on a population pharmacokinetics analysis are provided
below.

GM: Geometric mean,  %CV: Geometric coefficient of variation
16.1 (29)
Absorption
0.962 (19)
0.396 (63)
Following oral dosing, peak plasma concentrations are achieved 2 hours after dosing. Doravirine has
an estimated absolute bioavailability of approximately 64 % for the 100 mg tablet. 
Distribution
Based on administration of an intravenous microdose, the volume of distribution of doravirine is
60.5 L. Doravirine is approximately 76 % bound to plasma proteins.
Biotransformation
Based on in vitro data, doravirine is primarily metabolised by CYP3A.
Elimination
Doravirine
Doravirine has a terminal half-life (t1/2) of approximately 15 hours. Doravirine is primarily eliminated
via oxidative metabolism mediated by CYP3A4. Biliary excretion of unchanged medicinal product
may contribute to the elimination of doravirine, but this elimination route is not expected to be
significant. Excretion of unchanged medicinal product via urinary excretion is minor.
Lamivudine 
Following oral administration, lamivudine is rapidly absorbed and extensively distributed. After
27
multiple-dose oral administration of lamivudine 300 mg once daily for 7 days to 60 healthy subjects,
steady-state Cmax (Cmax,ss) was 2.04 ± 0.54 microgram per mL (mean ± SD) and the 24-hour steady-
state AUC (AUC24,ss) was 8.87 ± 1.83 mcg•hour per mL. Binding to plasma protein is low.
Approximately 71 % of an intravenous dose of lamivudine is recovered as unchanged medicinal
product in the urine. Metabolism of lamivudine is a minor route of elimination. In humans, the only
known metabolite is the trans-sulphoxide metabolite (approximately 5 % of an oral dose after
12 hours). In most single-dose trials in HIV-1 infected subjects, or healthy subjects with serum
sampling for 24 hours after dosing, the observed mean elimination half-life (t½) ranged from 5 to
7 hours. In HIV-1–infected subjects, total clearance was 398.5 ± 69.1 mL/min (mean ± SD).
Tenofovir disoproxil
Following oral administration of a single 245 mg dose of tenofovir disoproxil to HIV-1-infected
subjects in the fasted state, Cmax was achieved in one hour. Cmax and AUC values were
0.30  ±  0.09 micrograms per mL and 2.29 ± 0.69 µg•hr per mL, respectively. The oral bioavailability
of tenofovir from tenofovir disoproxil in fasted subjects is approximately 25 %. Less than 0.7 % of
tenofovir binds to human plasma proteins in vitro over the range of 0.01 to 25 micrograms per mL.
Approximately 70-80 % of the intravenous dose of tenofovir is recovered as unchanged medicinal
product in the urine within 72 hours of dosing. Tenofovir is eliminated by a combination of glomerular
filtration and active tubular secretion with a renal clearance in adults with CrCl greater than 80 mL per
minute of 243.5 ± 33.3 mL per minute (mean ± SD). Following oral administration, the terminal half-
life of tenofovir is approximately 12 to 18 hours. In vitro studies have determined that neither
tenofovir disoproxil nor tenofovir are substrates for the CYP450 enzymes.
Renal impairment
Doravirine
Renal excretion of doravirine is minor. In a study comparing 8 subjects with severe renal impairment
to 8 subjects without renal impairment, the single dose exposure of doravirine was 31 % higher in
subjects with severe renal impairment. In a population pharmacokinetic analysis, which included
subjects with CrCl between 17 and 317 mL/min, renal function did not have a clinically relevant effect
on doravirine pharmacokinetics. No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild, moderate or
severe renal impairment. Doravirine has not been studied in patients with end-stage renal disease or in
patients undergoing dialysis (see section 4.2).
Lamivudine
Studies with lamivudine show that plasma concentrations (AUC) are increased in patients with renal
dysfunction due to decreased clearance. Based on the lamivudine data, Delstrigo is not recommended
for patients with CrCl of < 50 mL/min.
Tenofovir disoproxil
Pharmacokinetic parameters of tenofovir were determined following administration of a single dose of
tenofovir disoproxil 245 mg to 40 non-HIV infected adult subjects with varying degrees of renal
impairment defined according to baseline CrCl (normal renal function when CrCl > 80 mL/min; mild
with CrCl = 50-79 mL/min; moderate with CrCl = 30-49 mL/min and severe with CrCl =
10-29 mL/min). Compared with subjects with normal renal function, the mean (% CV) tenofovir
exposure increased from 2,185 (12 %) ng•h/mL in subjects with CrCl > 80 mL/min to respectively
3,064 (30 %) ng•h/mL, 6,009 (42 %) ng•h/mL and 15,985 (45 %) ng•h/mL in subjects with mild,
moderate, and severe renal impairment.
The pharmacokinetics of tenofovir in non-haemodialysis adult subjects with CrCl < 10 mL/min and in
subjects with end-stage renal disease managed by peritoneal or other forms of dialysis have not been
studied.
28
Hepatic impairment
Doravirine
Doravirine is primarily metabolised and eliminated by the liver. There was no clinically relevant
difference in the pharmacokinetics of doravirine in a study comparing 8 subjects with moderate
hepatic impairment (classified as Child-Pugh score B primarily due to increased encephalopathy and
ascites scores) to 8 subjects without hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is required in patients
with mild or moderate hepatic impairment. Doravirine has not been studied in subjects with severe
hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score C) (see section 4.2).
Lamivudine
The pharmacokinetic properties of lamivudine have been determined in subjects with moderate to
severe hepatic impairment. Pharmacokinetic parameters were not altered by diminishing hepatic
function. Safety and efficacy of lamivudine have not been established in the presence of
decompensated liver disease.
Tenofovir disoproxil
The pharmacokinetics of tenofovir following a 245 mg dose of tenofovir disoproxil have been studied
in healthy subjects with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. No clinically relevant differences in
tenofovir pharmacokinetics were observed between subjects with hepatic impairment and healthy
subjects.
Paediatric population
Mean doravirine exposures were similar in 54 paediatric patients aged 12 to less than 18 years and
weighing at least 35 kg who received doravirine or doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil
IMPAACT 2014 (Protocol 027) relative to adults following administration of doravirine or
doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil. Exposures of lamivudine and tenofovir in paediatric
subjects following the administration of doravirine/lamivudine/tenofovir disoproxil were similar to
those in adults following administration of lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil (Table 6).

Elderly
Although a limited number of subjects aged 65 years and over has been included (n = 36), no
clinically relevant differences in the pharmacokinetics of doravirine have been identified in subjects at
least 65 years of age compared to subjects less than 65 years of age in a Phase 1 trial or in a population
pharmacokinetic analysis. The pharmacokinetics of lamivudine and tenofovir have not been studied in
subjects older than 65 years. No dose adjustment is required.
29
 
Gender
No clinically relevant pharmacokinetic differences have been identified between men and women for
doravirine, lamivudine, and tenofovir.
Race
Doravirine
No clinically relevant racial differences in the pharmacokinetics of doravirine have been identified
based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of doravirine in healthy and HIV-1-infected subjects.
Lamivudine
There are no significant or clinically relevant racial differences in pharmacokinetics of lamivudine.
Tenofovir disoproxil
There were insufficient numbers from racial and ethnic groups other than Caucasian to adequately
determine potential pharmacokinetic differences among these populations following the administration
of tenofovir disoproxil.
5.3  Preclinical safety data
Reproductive toxicity
Doravirine
Reproduction studies with orally administered doravirine have been performed in rats and rabbits at
exposures approximately 9 times (rats) and 8 times (rabbits) the exposure in humans at the
recommended human dose (RHD) with no effects on embryo-foetal (rats and rabbits) or pre/postnatal
(rats) development. Studies in pregnant rats and rabbits showed that doravirine is transferred to the
foetus through the placenta, with foetal plasma concentrations of up to 40 % (rabbits) and 52 % (rats)
that of maternal concentrations observed on gestation Day 20.
Doravirine was excreted into the milk of lactating rats following oral administration, with milk
concentrations approximately 1.5 times that of maternal plasma concentrations.
Lamivudine
Lamivudine was not teratogenic in animal studies but there were indications of an increase in early
embryonic deaths in rabbits at relatively low systemic exposures, comparable to those achieved in
humans. A similar effect was not seen in rats even at very high systemic exposure.
Tenofovir disoproxil
Reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits showed no effects on mating, fertility, pregnancy or
foetal parameters. However, tenofovir disoproxil reduced the viability index and weight of pups in a
peri-postnatal toxicity study at maternally toxic doses.
Carcinogenesis
Doravirine
Long-term oral carcinogenicity studies of doravirine in mice and rats showed no evidence of
carcinogenic potential at estimated exposures up to 6 times (mice) and 7 times (rats) the human
exposures at the RHD.
Lamivudine
Long-term carcinogenicity studies with lamivudine in mice and rats showed no evidence of
carcinogenic potential at exposures up to 12 times (mice) and 57 times (rats) the human exposures at
the RHD.
30
Tenofovir disoproxil
Oral carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice only revealed a low incidence of duodenal tumours at an
extremely high-dose in mice. These tumours are unlikely to be of relevance to humans.
Mutagenesis
Doravirine
Doravirine was not genotoxic in a battery of in vitro or in vivo assays.
Lamivudine
Lamivudine was mutagenic in an L5178Y mouse lymphoma assay and clastogenic in a cytogenetic
assay using cultured human lymphocytes. Lamivudine was not mutagenic in a microbial mutagenicity
assay, in an in vitro cell transformation assay, in a rat micronucleus test, in a rat bone marrow
cytogenetic assay, and in an assay for unscheduled DNA synthesis in rat liver.
Tenofovir disoproxil
Tenofovir disoproxil was mutagenic in the in vitro mouse lymphoma assay and negative in an in vitro
bacterial mutagenicity test (Ames test). In an in vivo mouse micronucleus assay, tenofovir disoproxil
was negative when administered to male mice.
Impairment of fertility
Doravirine
There were no effects on fertility, mating performance or early embryonic development when
doravirine was administered to rats at up to 7 times the exposure in humans at the RHD.
Lamivudine
Lamivudine did not affect male or female fertility in rats.
Tenofovir disoproxil
Reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits showed no effects on mating, fertility, pregnancy or
foetal parameters.
Repeat dose toxicity
Doravirine
Administration of doravirine in animal toxicity studies was not associated with toxicity.
Lamivudine
Administration of lamivudine in animal toxicity studies at high doses was not associated with any
major organ toxicity. At the highest dosage levels, minor effects on indicators of liver and kidney
function were seen together with occasional reductions in liver weight. The clinically relevant effects
noted were a reduction in red blood cell count and neutropenia.
Tenofovir disoproxil
Findings in repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats, dogs and monkeys at exposure levels greater than or
equal to clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use included kidney and bone
changes and a decrease in serum phosphate concentration. Bone toxicity was diagnosed as
osteomalacia (monkeys) and reduced bone mineral density (BMD) (rats and dogs). The bone toxicity
in young adult rats and dogs occurred at exposures ≥ 5-fold the exposure in paediatric or adult
patients; bone toxicity occurred in juvenile infected monkeys at very high exposures following
subcutaneous dosing (≥ 40-fold the exposure in patients). Findings in the rat and monkey studies
indicated that there was a substance related decrease in intestinal absorption of phosphate with
potential secondary reduction in BMD.

Contents of the pack and other information
1.  What Delstrigo is and what it is used for
What Delstrigo is
Delstrigo is used to treat HIV (‘human immunodeficiency virus’) infection. It belongs to a group of
medicines called ‘antiretroviral medicines’.
Delstrigo contains the active substances:
• 
• 
• 
Doravirine - a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)
Lamivudine - a nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)
Tenofovir disoproxil - a nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)
What Delstrigo is used for
Delstrigo is used to treat HIV infection in adults, and adolescents aged 12 years and older weighing at
least 35 kg. HIV is the virus that causes AIDS (‘acquired immune deficiency syndrome’). You should
not take Delstrigo if your doctor has told you that the virus causing your infection is resistant to any of
the medicines in Delstrigo.
How Delstrigo works
Delstrigo works by preventing HIV from making more viruses in your body. This will help by:
• 
• 
reducing the amount of HIV in your blood (this is called your ‘viral load’)
increasing the number of white blood cells called ‘CD4+ T’. This can make your immune system
stronger. This may reduce your risk of early death or catching infections because your immune
system is weak.
2.  What you need to know before you take Delstrigo
Do not take Delstrigo
• 
• 
if you are allergic to doravirine, lamivudine or tenofovir disoproxil or any of the other
ingredients of this medicine listed in section 6.
if you are taking any of the following medicines:
-  carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin (medicines for seizure)
43
-  rifampicin, rifapentine (medicines for tuberculosis)
- St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum, a herbal remedy used for depression and anxiety) or
products that contain it
-  mitotane (a medicine to treat cancer)
-  enzalutamide (a medicine to treat prostate cancer)
-  lumacaftor (a medicine to treat cystic fibrosis)
Do not take Delstrigo if the above applies to you. If you are not sure, talk to your doctor, pharmacist,
or nurse before taking Delstrigo. See also the list in section “Other Medicines and Delstrigo”.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse before taking Delstrigo.
Worsening of hepatitis B infection
If you have both HIV and hepatitis B virus infections, your hepatitis B may get worse if you stop
taking Delstrigo. You may require blood tests for several months after stopping treatment. Discuss
your hepatitis B therapy with your doctor.
New or worsening kidney problems, including kidney failure
This can happen in some people who take Delstrigo. Your doctor will do blood tests to check your
kidney function before and during treatment with Delstrigo.
Bone problems
This can happen in some people who take Delstrigo. Bone problems include bone pain, and bone
softening or thinning (which may lead to fractures). Joint or muscle pain or muscle weakness may also
occur. Your doctor may need to do additional tests to check your bones.
Immune reactivation syndrome
This can happen when you start taking any HIV medicine, including Delstrigo. Your immune system
may get stronger and begin to fight infections that have been hidden in your body for a long time. Tell
your doctor right away if you start having any new symptoms after starting your HIV medicine.
Autoimmune disorders (a condition that occurs when the immune system attacks healthy body tissue)
may also occur after you start taking medicines for the treatment of your HIV infection. Autoimmune
disorders may occur many months after the start of treatment. If you notice any symptoms of infection
or other symptoms such as muscle weakness, weakness beginning in the hands and feet and moving up
towards the trunk of the body, palpitations, tremor or hyperactivity, please inform your doctor
immediately to seek necessary treatment.
Children and adolescents
Do not give this medicine to children aged less than 12 years or weighing less than 35 kg. The use
of Delstrigo in children aged less than 12 years or weighing less than 35 kg has not yet been studied.
44
Other medicines and Delstrigo
Tell your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other
medicines. This is because other medicines may affect how Delstrigo works, and Delstrigo might
affect the way some other medicines work.
There are some medicines you must not take with Delstrigo. See list under “Do not take Delstrigo”
section.
Talk to your doctor before taking the following medicines with Delstrigo as your doctor may need to
bosentan (a medicine to treat lung disease)
dabrafenib (a medicine to treat skin cancer)
lesinurad (a medicine to treat gout)
change the dose of your medicines:
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
modafinil (a medicine to treat excessive sleepiness)
nafcillin (a medicine to treat some bacterial infections)
rifabutin (a medicine to treat some bacterial infections such as tuberculosis)
telotristat ethyl (a medicine to treat diarrhea in people with carcinoid syndrome)
thioridazine (a medicine to treat psychiatric conditions such as schizophrenia)
If your doctor decides you should take these medicines with Delstrigo, your doctor will prescribe a
100 mg tablet of doravirine to be taken daily, approximately 12 hours after your dose of Delstrigo.
Your doctor may check your blood levels or monitor for side effects if you take the following
medicines with Delstrigo:
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (medicines used to treat hepatitis C infection)
sirolimus (a medicine used to control your body’s immune response after a transplant)
sofosbuvir/velpatasvir (medicines used to treat hepatitis C infection)
tacrolimus (a medicine used to control your body’s immune response after a transplant)
medicines (usually liquids) containing sorbitol and other sugar alcohols (such as xylitol,
mannitol, lactitol or maltitol), if taken regularly
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, think you may be pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, talk to
your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking Delstrigo. It is preferable to avoid the use of
Delstrigo during pregnancy. This is because it has not been studied in pregnancy and it is not known if
Delstrigo will harm your baby while you are pregnant.
Breast-feeding is not recommended in women living with HIV because HIV infection can be passed
on to the baby in breast milk.
If you are breast-feeding, or thinking about breast-feeding, you should discuss it with your doctor as
soon as possible.
Driving and using machines
Use with caution when driving, riding a bicycle, or operating machines if you feel tired, dizzy, or
sleepy after taking this medicine
Delstrigo tablets contains lactose
If you have been told by your doctor that you have an intolerance to lactose, talk to your doctor before
taking this medicine.
45
3.  How to take Delstrigo
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor, pharmacist, or nurse has told you. Check with your
doctor, pharmacist, or nurse if you are not sure. Delstrigo is a complete regimen taken as a single
tablet for the treatment of HIV infection.
How much to take
The recommended dose is 1 tablet once a day. If you take certain medicines your doctor may need to
change the amount of doravirine you take. See “Other medicines and Delstrigo” section for a list of
medicines.
Taking this medicine
• 
• 
Swallow the tablet whole (do not crush or chew).
This medicine can be taken with food or between meals.
If you take more Delstrigo than you should
Do not take more than the recommended dose. If you accidentally take more, contact your doctor.
If you forget to take Delstrigo
• 
• 
It is important that you do not miss or skip doses of Delstrigo.
If you forget a dose, take it as soon as you remember. But if your next dose is due within
12 hours, skip the dose you missed and take the next one at the usual time. Then continue your
treatment as before.
• 
• 
Do not take two doses of Delstrigo at the same time to make up for a missed dose.
If you are not sure what to do, call your doctor or pharmacist.
If you stop taking Delstrigo
Do not run out of Delstrigo. Refill your prescription or talk to your doctor before your Delstrigo is all
gone.
If you stop taking Delstrigo, your doctor will need to check your health often and do blood tests
regularly for several months to check your HIV infection. If you have HIV infection and hepatitis B
infection, it is especially important not to stop your Delstrigo treatment without talking to your doctor
first. Some patients have had blood tests or symptoms indicating that their hepatitis has worsened after
stopping lamivudine or tenofovir disoproxil (two of the three active substances of Delstrigo). If
Delstrigo is stopped your doctor may recommend that you resume hepatitis B treatment. You may
need blood tests to check how your liver is working for 4 months after stopping treatment. In some
patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, stopping treatment is not recommended as this may
lead to worsening of your hepatitis, which may be life-threatening.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

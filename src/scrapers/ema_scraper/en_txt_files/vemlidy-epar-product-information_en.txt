4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Vemlidy is indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in adults and paediatric patients 
6 years of age and older weighing at least 25 kg (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Therapy should be initiated by a physician experienced in the management of CHB. 
Posology 
Adults and paediatric patients at least 6 years of age and older weighing at least 25 kg: one tablet once 
daily. 
Treatment discontinuation 
Treatment discontinuation may be considered as follows (see section 4.4): 
• 
• 
In HBeAg-positive patients without cirrhosis, treatment should be administered for at least 6-
12 months after HBe seroconversion (HBeAg loss and HBV DNA loss with anti-HBe detection) 
is confirmed or until HBs seroconversion or until there is loss of efficacy (see section 4.4). 
Regular reassessment is recommended after treatment discontinuation to detect virological 
relapse. 
In HBeAg-negative patients without cirrhosis, treatment should be administered at least until 
HBs seroconversion or until there is evidence of loss of efficacy. With prolonged treatment for 
more than 2 years, regular reassessment is recommended to confirm that continuing the selected 
therapy remains appropriate for the patient.

Missed dose 
If a dose is missed and less than 18 hours have passed from the time it is usually taken, the patient 
should take this medicinal product as soon as possible and then resume their normal dosing schedule. 
If more than 18 hours have passed from the time it is usually taken, the patient should not take the 
missed dose and should simply resume the normal dosing schedule.  
If the patient vomits within 1 hour of taking the treatment, the patient should take another tablet. If the 
patient vomits more than 1 hour after taking the treatment, the patient does not need to take another 
tablet. 
Special populations 
Elderly 
No dose adjustment of this medicinal product is required in patients aged 65 years and older 
(see section 5.2). 
Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment of this medicinal product is required in adults or adolescents (aged at least 
12 years and of at least 35 kg body weight) with estimated creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 15 mL/min or 
in patients with CrCl < 15 mL/min who are receiving haemodialysis. 
On days of haemodialysis, this medicinal product should be administered after completion of 
haemodialysis treatment (see section 5.2). 
No dosing recommendations can be given for patients with CrCl < 15 mL/min who are not receiving 
haemodialysis (see section 4.4). 
No data are available to make dose recommendations in children aged less than 12 years and of less 
than 35 kg body weight with renal impairment. 
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment of this medicinal product is required in patients with hepatic impairment (see 
sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Vemlidy in children younger than 6 years of age or weighing < 25 kg have 
not yet been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Oral use. Vemlidy film-coated tablets should be taken with food (see section 5.2). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) transmission 
Patients must be advised that this medicinal product does not prevent the risk of transmission of HBV 
to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood. Appropriate precautions must continue 
to be used.

Patients with decompensated liver disease 
There are limited data on the safety and efficacy of tenofovir alafenamide in HBV infected patients 
with decompensated liver disease and who have a Child Pugh Turcotte (CPT) score > 9 (i.e. class C). 
These patients may be at higher risk of experiencing serious hepatic or renal adverse reactions. 
Therefore, hepatobiliary and renal parameters should be closely monitored in this patient population 
(see section 5.2). 
Exacerbation of hepatitis 
Flares on treatment  
Spontaneous exacerbations in CHB are relatively common and are characterised by transient increases 
in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT). After initiating antiviral therapy, serum ALT may increase 
in some patients. In patients with compensated liver disease, these increases in serum ALT are 
generally not accompanied by an increase in serum bilirubin concentrations or hepatic 
decompensation. Patients with cirrhosis may be at a higher risk for hepatic decompensation following 
hepatitis exacerbation, and therefore should be monitored closely during therapy. 
Flares after treatment discontinuation 
Acute exacerbation of hepatitis has been reported in patients who have discontinued treatment for 
CHB, usually in association with rising HBV DNA levels in plasma. The majority of cases are 
self-limited but severe exacerbations, including fatal outcomes, may occur after discontinuation of 
treatment for CHB. Hepatic function should be monitored at repeated intervals with both clinical and 
laboratory follow-up for at least 6 months after discontinuation of treatment for CHB. If appropriate, 
resumption of CHB therapy may be warranted. 
In patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, treatment discontinuation is not recommended 
since post-treatment exacerbation of hepatitis may lead to hepatic decompensation. Liver flares are 
especially serious, and sometimes fatal in patients with decompensated liver disease. 
Renal impairment 
Patients with creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min 
The use of tenofovir alafenamide once daily in patients with CrCl ≥ 15 mL/min and < 30 mL/min is 
based on Week 96 data on the efficacy and safety of switching from another antiviral regimen to 
tenofovir alafenamide in an open-label clinical study of virologically suppressed HBV-infected 
patients (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). There are very limited data on the safety and efficacy of tenofovir 
alafenamide in HBV-infected patients with CrCl < 15 mL/min on chronic haemodialysis (see 
sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2). 
The use of this medicinal product is not recommended in patients with CrCl < 15 mL/min who are not 
receiving haemodialysis (see section 4.2). 
Nephrotoxicity 
Post-marketing cases of renal impairment, including acute renal failure and proximal renal 
tubulopathy have been reported with tenofovir alafenamide-containing products. A potential risk of 
nephrotoxicity resulting from chronic exposure to low levels of tenofovir due to dosing with tenofovir 
alafenamide cannot be excluded (see section 5.3). 
It is recommended that renal function is assessed in all patients prior to, or when initiating, therapy 
with this treatment and that it is also monitored during therapy in all patients as clinically appropriate. 
In patients who develop clinically significant decreases in renal function, or evidence of proximal 
renal tubulopathy, discontinuation of this medicinal product should be considered.

Patients co-infected with HBV and hepatitis C or D virus 
There are no data on the safety and efficacy of tenofovir alafenamide in patients co-infected with 
hepatitis C (HCV) or D (HDV) virus. Co-administration guidance for the treatment of HCV should be 
followed (see section 4.5). 
HBV and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) co-infection 
HIV antibody testing should be offered to all HBV infected patients whose HIV-1 infection status is 
unknown before initiating therapy with this medicinal product. In patients who are co-infected with 
HBV and HIV, Vemlidy should be co-administered with other antiretroviral medicinal products to 
ensure that the patient receives an appropriate regimen for treatment of HIV (see section 4.5). 
Co-administration with other medicinal products 
This medicinal product should not be co-administered with medicinal products containing tenofovir 
alafenamide, tenofovir disoproxil or adefovir dipivoxil. 
Co-administration of this treatment with certain anticonvulsants (e.g. carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, 
phenobarbital and phenytoin), antimycobacterials (e.g. rifampicin, rifabutin and rifapentine) or 
St. John’s wort, all of which are inducers of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and may decrease tenofovir 
alafenamide plasma concentrations, is not recommended. 
Co-administration of this treatment with strong inhibitors of P-gp (e.g. itraconazole and ketoconazole) 
may increase tenofovir alafenamide plasma concentrations. Co-administration is not recommended. 
Paediatric population 
Reductions in bone mineral density (BMD ≥ 4%) of the lumbar spine and of whole body have been 
reported in some paediatric patients 6 years of age and older weighing at least 25 kg who received 
tenofovir alafenamide for 48 weeks (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). The long-term effects of changes in 
BMD on the growing bone, including the risk of fracture, are uncertain. A multidisciplinary approach 
is recommended to decide the appropriate monitoring during treatment. 
Excipients with known effect 
This medicinal product contains lactose monohydrate. Patients with rare hereditary problems of 
galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this 
medicinal product. 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
This medicinal product should not be co-administered with medicinal products containing tenofovir 
disoproxil, tenofovir alafenamide or adefovir dipivoxil. 
Medicinal products that may affect tenofovir alafenamide 
Tenofovir alafenamide is transported by P-gp and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP). Medicinal 
products that are P-gp inducers (e.g., rifampicin, rifabutin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital or 
St. John’s wort) are expected to decrease plasma concentrations of tenofovir alafenamide, which may 
lead to loss of therapeutic effect of Vemlidy. Co-administration of such medicinal products with 
tenofovir alafenamide is not recommended. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Co-administration of tenofovir alafenamide with medicinal products that inhibit P-gp and BCRP may 
increase plasma concentrations of tenofovir alafenamide. Co-administration of strong inhibitors of 
P-gp with tenofovir alafenamide is not recommended. 
Tenofovir alafenamide is a substrate of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in vitro. The distribution of 
tenofovir alafenamide in the body may be affected by the activity of OATP1B1 and/or OATP1B3. 
Effect of tenofovir alafenamide on other medicinal products 
Tenofovir alafenamide is not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or 
CYP2D6 in vitro. It is not an inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A in vivo. 
Tenofovir alafenamide is not an inhibitor of human uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 
(UGT) 1A1 in vitro. It is not known whether tenofovir alafenamide is an inhibitor of other 
UGT enzymes. 
Drug interaction information for Vemlidy with potential concomitant medicinal products is 
summarised in Table 1 below (increase is indicated as “↑”, decrease as “↓”, no change as “↔”; twice 
daily as “b.i.d.”, single dose as “s.d.”, once daily as “q.d.”). The drug interactions described are based 
on studies conducted with tenofovir alafenamide, or are potential drug interactions that may occur 
with Vemlidy.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
A moderate amount of data on pregnant women exposed to tenofovir alafenamide (between 300-1000 
pregnancy outcomes) indicate no malformative or feto/neonatal toxicity. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). 
The use of tenofovir alafenamide may be considered during pregnancy, if necessary. 
Breast-feeding 
Based on published data, tenofovir alafenamide and tenofovir are excreted in human milk at low levels 
in women administered with tenofovir alafenamide. There is insufficient information on the effects of 
tenofovir in newborns/infants. 
A risk to the breast-fed newborns/infants cannot be excluded; therefore, tenofovir alafenamide should 
not be used during breast-feeding. 
Fertility 
No human data on the effect of tenofovir alafenamide on fertility are available. Animal studies do not 
indicate harmful effects of tenofovir alafenamide on fertility. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Vemlidy may have minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be 
informed that dizziness has been reported during treatment with tenofovir alafenamide. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Assessment of adverse reactions is based on clinical study data and postmarketing data. In pooled 
safety data from 2 controlled Phase 3 studies (GS-US-320-0108 and GS-US-320-0110; “Study 108” 
and “Study 110”, respectively), the most frequently reported adverse reactions at Week 96 analysis 
were headache (12%), nausea (6%), and fatigue (6%). After Week 96, patients either remained on their 
original blinded treatment up to Week 144 or received open-label tenofovir alafenamide. 
The safety profile of tenofovir alafenamide was similar in virologically suppressed patients switching 
from tenofovir disoproxil to tenofovir alafenamide in Study 108, Study 110 and a controlled Phase 3 
study GS-US-320-4018 (“Study 4018”). Changes in lipid laboratory tests were observed in these 
studies following a switch from tenofovir disoproxil (see section 5.1).

In the open-label Phase 2 study (GS-US-320-4035; “Study 4035”) to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of switching from another antiviral regimen to tenofovir alafenamide in virologically suppressed HBV 
infected patients, small median increases in fasting total cholesterol, direct low density lipoprotein 
(LDL), high density lipoprotein (HDL), and triglycerides from baseline to Week 96 were observed in 
patients with moderate or severe renal impairment (Part A Cohort 1) and patients with moderate or 
severe hepatic impairment (Part B), consistent with changes observed in Studies 108 and 110. Small 
median decreases in total cholesterol, LDL and triglycerides were observed in patients with ESRD on 
hemodialysis in Part A Cohort 2, while small median increases were observed in HDL from baseline 
to Week 96. Median (Q1, Q3) change from baseline at Week 96 in total cholesterol to HDL ratio was 
0.1 (-0.4, 0.4) in the moderate or severe renal impairment group, and -0.4 (-0.8,-0.1) in patients with 
ESRD on hemodialysis and 0.1 (-0.2, 0.4) in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. 
Metabolic parameters 
Body weight and levels of blood lipids and glucose may increase during therapy. 
Special populations 
In Study 4035 in virologically suppressed patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (eGFR by 
Cockcroft-Gault method 15 to 59 mL/min; Part A, Cohort 1, N = 78), end stage renal disease (ESRD) 
(eGFR < 15 mL/min) on haemodialysis (Part A, Cohort 2, N = 15), and/or moderate to severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C at screening or by history; Part B, N = 31) who switched from 
another antiviral regimen to tenofovir alafenamide, no additional adverse reactions to tenofovir 
alafenamide were identified through Week 96. 
Paediatric population 
The safety of tenofovir alafenamide was evaluated in 88 HBV-infected treatment-naïve and treatment-
experienced paediatric patients between the ages of 12 to < 18 years weighing ≥ 35 kg (tenofovir 
alafenamide group N=47, placebo group N=23) and 6 to < 12 years weighing ≥ 25 kg (tenofovir 
alafenamide group N=12, placebo group N=6) through Week 24 in a randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled clinical study GS-US-320-1092 (“Study 1092”). After the double-blind phase, 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients were switched to open-label tenofovir alafenamide at Week 24. The safety profile of tenofovir 
alafenamide in paediatric patients was comparable to that in adults. Reductions in bone mineral 
density (BMD ≥ 4%) of the lumbar spine and of whole body have been reported in some paediatric 
patients 6 years of age and older weighing at least 25 kg who received tenofovir alafenamide for up to 
48 weeks (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
If overdose occurs the patient must be monitored for evidence of toxicity (see section 4.8). 
Treatment of overdose with tenofovir alafenamide consists of general supportive measures including 
monitoring of vital signs as well as observation of the clinical status of the patient. 
Tenofovir is efficiently removed by haemodialysis with an extraction coefficient of 
approximately 54%. It is not known whether tenofovir can be removed by peritoneal dialysis.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antiviral for systemic use, nucleoside and nucleotide reverse 
transcriptase inhibitors; ATC code: J05AF13. 
Mechanism of action 
Tenofovir alafenamide is a phosphonamidate prodrug of tenofovir (2’-deoxyadenosine 
monophosphate analogue). Tenofovir alafenamide enters primary hepatocytes by passive diffusion and 
by the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Tenofovir alafenamide is primarily 
hydrolysed to form tenofovir by carboxylesterase 1 in primary hepatocytes. Intracellular tenofovir is 
subsequently phosphorylated to the pharmacologically active metabolite tenofovir diphosphate. 
Tenofovir diphosphate inhibits HBV replication through incorporation into viral DNA by the 
HBV reverse transcriptase, which results in DNA chain termination. 
Tenofovir has activity that is specific to HBV and HIV (HIV-1 and HIV-2). Tenofovir diphosphate is 
a weak inhibitor of mammalian DNA polymerases that include mitochondrial DNA polymerase γ and 
there is no evidence of mitochondrial toxicity in vitro based on several assays including mitochondrial 
DNA analyses. 
Antiviral activity 
The antiviral activity of tenofovir alafenamide was assessed in HepG2 cells against a panel of 
HBV clinical isolates representing genotypes A-H. The EC50 (50% effective concentration) values for 
tenofovir alafenamide ranged from 34.7 to 134.4 nM, with an overall mean EC50 of 86.6 nM. The CC50 
(50% cytotoxicity concentration) in HepG2 cells was > 44,400 nM. 
Resistance 
In patients receiving tenofovir alafenamide, sequence analysis was performed on paired baseline and 
on-treatment HBV isolates for patients who either experienced virologic breakthrough (2 consecutive 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
visits with HBV DNA ≥ 69 IU/mL after having been < 69 IU/mL, or 1.0 log10 or greater increase in 
HBV DNA from nadir) or patients with HBV DNA ≥ 69 IU/mL at Week 48, or Week 96 or at early 
discontinuation at or after Week 24.  
In a pooled analysis of patients receiving tenofovir alafenamide in Study 108 and Study 110 at 
Week 48 (N = 20) and Week 96 (N = 72), no amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to 
tenofovir alafenamide were identified in these isolates (genotypic and phenotypic analyses). 
In virologically suppressed patients receiving tenofovir alafenamide following switch from tenofovir 
disoproxil treatment in Study 4018, through 96 weeks of tenofovir alafenamide treatment one patient 
in the tenofovir alafenamide-tenofovir alafenamide group experienced a virologic blip (one visit with 
HBV DNA ≥ 69 IU/mL) and one patient in the tenofovir disoproxil-tenofovir alafenamide group 
experienced a virologic breakthrough. No HBV amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to 
tenofovir alafenamide or tenofovir disoproxil were detected through 96 weeks of treatment. 
In paediatric Study 1092, 30 patients aged 12 to < 18 years and 9 patients aged 6 to < 12 years 
receiving tenofovir alafenamide qualified for resistance analysis at Week 24. No HBV amino acid 
substitutions associated with resistance to tenofovir alafenamide were detected through 24 weeks of 
treatment. At Week 48, 31 patients aged 12 to < 18 years and 12 patients aged 6 to < 12 years 
qualified for resistance analysis (both tenofovir alafenamide group and placebo roll over to tenofovir 
alafenamide group at Week 24). No HBV amino acid substitutions associated with resistance to 
tenofovir alafenamide were detected through 48 weeks of treatment. 
Cross-resistance 
The antiviral activity of tenofovir alafenamide was evaluated against a panel of isolates containing 
nucleos(t)ide reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations in HepG2 cells. HBV isolates expressing the 
rtV173L, rtL180M, and rtM204V/I substitutions associated with resistance to lamivudine remained 
susceptible to tenofovir alafenamide (< 2-fold change in EC50). HBV isolates expressing the rtL180M, 
rtM204V plus rtT184G, rtS202G, or rtM250V substitutions associated with resistance to entecavir 
remained susceptible to tenofovir alafenamide. HBV isolates expressing the rtA181T, rtA181V, or 
rtN236T single substitutions associated with resistance to adefovir remained susceptible to tenofovir 
alafenamide; however, the HBV isolate expressing rtA181V plus rtN236T exhibited reduced 
susceptibility to tenofovir alafenamide (3.7-fold change in EC50). The clinical relevance of these 
substitutions is not known. 
Clinical data 
The efficacy and safety of tenofovir alafenamide in patients with CHB are based on 48- and 96-week 
data from two randomised, double-blind, active-controlled studies, Study 108 and Study 110. The 
safety of tenofovir alafenamide is also supported by pooled data from patients in Studies 108 and 110 
who remained on blinded treatment from Week 96 through Week 144 and additionally from patients 
in the open-label phase of Studies 108 and 110 from Week 96 through Week 144 (N = 360 remained 
on tenofovir alafenamide; N = 180 switched from tenofovir disoproxil to tenofovir alafenamide at 
Week 96). 
In Study 108, HBeAg-negative treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients with compensated 
liver function were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive tenofovir alafenamide (25 mg; N = 285) once 
daily or tenofovir disoproxil (245 mg; N = 140) once daily. The mean age was 46 years, 61% were 
male, 72% were Asian, 25% were White and 2% (8 patients) were Black. 24%, 38%, and 31% had 
HBV genotype B, C, and D, respectively. 21% were treatment-experienced (previous treatment with 
oral antivirals, including entecavir (N = 41), lamivudine (N = 42), tenofovir disoproxil (N = 21), or 
other (N = 18)). At baseline, mean plasma HBV DNA was 5.8 log10 IU/mL, mean serum ALT was 
94 U/L, and 9% of patients had a history of cirrhosis. 
In Study 110, HBeAg-positive treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced patients with compensated 
liver function were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive tenofovir alafenamide (25 mg; N = 581) once 
daily or tenofovir disoproxil (245 mg; N = 292) once daily. The mean age was 38 years, 64% were 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
male, 82% were Asian, 17% were White and < 1% (5 patients) were Black. 17%, 52%, and 23% had 
HBV genotype B, C, and D, respectively. 26% were treatment-experienced (previous treatment with 
oral antivirals, including adefovir (N = 42), entecavir (N = 117), lamivudine (N = 84), telbivudine 
(N = 25), tenofovir disoproxil (N = 70), or other (N = 17)). At baseline, mean plasma HBV DNA was 
7.6 log10 IU/mL, mean serum ALT was 120 U/L, and 7% of patients had a history of cirrhosis. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was the proportion of patients with plasma HBV DNA 
levels below 29 IU/mL at Week 48. Tenofovir alafenamide met the non-inferiority criteria in 
achieving HBV DNA less than 29 IU/mL when compared to tenofovir disoproxil. Treatment outcomes 
of Study 108 and Study 110 through Week 48 are presented in Table 3 and Table 4.

Changes in measures of bone mineral density in Study 108 and Study 110 
In both studies tenofovir alafenamide was associated with smaller mean percentage decreases in BMD 
(as measured by hip and lumbar spine dual energy X ray absorptiometry [DXA] analysis) compared to 
tenofovir disoproxil after 96 weeks of treatment. 
In patients who remained on blinded treatment beyond Week 96, mean percentage change in BMD in 
each group at Week 144 was similar to that at Week 96. In the open-label phase of both studies, mean 
percentage change in BMD from Week 96 to Week 144 in patients who remained on tenofovir 
alafenamide was +0.4% at the lumbar spine and -0.3% at the total hip, compared to +2.0% at the 
lumbar spine and +0.9% at the total hip in those who switched from tenofovir disoproxil to tenofovir 
alafenamide at Week 96. 
Changes in measures of renal function in Study 108 and Study 110 
In both studies tenofovir alafenamide was associated with smaller changes in renal safety parameters 
(smaller median reductions in estimated CrCl by Cockcroft-Gault and smaller median percentage 
increases in urine retinol binding protein to creatinine ratio and urine beta-2-microglobulin to 
creatinine ratio) compared to tenofovir disoproxil after 96 weeks of treatment (see also section 4.4). 
In patients who remained on blinded treatment beyond Week 96 in Studies 108 and 110, changes from 
baseline in renal laboratory parameter values in each group at Week 144 were similar to those at 
Week 96. In the open-label phase of Studies 108 and 110, the mean (SD) change in serum creatinine 
from Week 96 to Week 144 was +0.002 (0.0924) mg/dL in those who remained on tenofovir 
alafenamide, compared to -0.018 (0.0691) mg/dL in those who switched from tenofovir disoproxil to 
tenofovir alafenamide at Week 96. In the open-label phase, the median change in eGFR from Week 96 
to Week 144 was -1.2 mL/min in patients who remained on tenofovir alafenamide, compared to 
+4.2 mL/min in patients who switched from tenofovir disoproxil to tenofovir alafenamide at Week 96.  
Changes in lipid laboratory tests in Study 108 and Study 110 
In a pooled analysis of Studies 108 and 110, median changes in fasting lipid parameters from baseline 
to Week 96 were observed in both treatment groups. For patients who switched to open label tenofovir 
alafenamide at Week 96, changes from double-blind baseline for patients randomised initially to 
tenofovir alafenamide and tenofovir disoproxil at Week 96 and Week 144 in total cholesterol, 
HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and total cholesterol to HDL ratio are presented in 
Table 6. At Week 96, the end of the double-blind phase, decreases in median fasting total cholesterol 
and HDL, and increases in median fasting direct LDL and triglycerides were observed in the tenofovir 
alafenamide group, while the tenofovir disoproxil group demonstrated median reductions in all 
parameters. 
In the open-label phase of Studies 108 and 110, where patients switched to open-label tenofovir 
alafenamide at Week 96, lipid parameters at Week 144 in patients who remained on tenofovir 
alafenamide were similar to those at Week 96, whereas median increases in fasting total cholesterol, 
direct LDL, HDL, and triglycerides were observed in patients who switched from tenofovir disoproxil 
to tenofovir alafenamide at Week 96. In the open label phase, median (Q1, Q3) change from Week 96 
to Week 144 in total cholesterol to HDL ratio was 0.0 (-0.2, 0.4) in patients who remained on 
tenofovir alafenamide and 0.2 (-0.2, 0.6) in patients who switched from tenofovir disoproxil to 
tenofovir alafenamide at Week 96.

Virologically suppressed adult patients in Study 4018 
The efficacy and safety of tenofovir alafenamide in virologically suppressed adults with chronic 
hepatitis B is based on 48-week data from a randomised, double-blind, active-controlled study, Study 
4018 (N=243 on tenofovir alafenamide; N=245 on tenofovir disoproxil), including data from patients 
who participated in the open-label phase of Study 4018 from Week 48 through Week 96 (N=235 
remained on tenofovir alafenamide [TAF-TAF]; N=237 switched from tenofovir disoproxil to 
tenofovir alafenamide at Week 48 [TDF-TAF]). 
In Study 4018 virologically suppressed adults with chronic hepatitis B (N=488) were enrolled who had 
been previously maintained on 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil once daily for at least 12 months, with 
HBV DNA < lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) by local laboratory assessment for at least 12 
weeks prior to screening and HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL at screening. Patients were stratified by HBeAg 
status (HBeAg-positive or HBeAg-negative) and age (≥ 50 or < 50 years) and randomised in a 1:1 
ratio to switch to 25 mg tenofovir alafenamide (N=243) or remain on 245 mg tenofovir disoproxil 
once daily (N=245). Mean age was 51 years (22% were ≥ 60 years), 71% were male, 82% were Asian, 
14% were White, and 68% were HBeAg-negative. At baseline, median duration of prior tenofovir 
disoproxil treatment was 220 and 224 weeks in the tenofovir alafenamide and tenofovir disoproxil 
groups, respectively. Previous treatment with antivirals also included interferon (N=63), lamivudine 
(N=191), adefovir dipivoxil (N=185), entecavir (N=99), telbivudine (N=48), or other (N=23). At 
baseline, mean serum ALT was 27 U/L, median eGFR by Cockcroft-Gault was 90.5 mL/min; 16% of 
patients had a history of cirrhosis. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with plasma HBV DNA 
levels ≥ 20 IU/mL at Week 48 (as determined by the modified US FDA Snapshot algorithm). 
Additional efficacy endpoints included the proportion of patients with HBV DNA levels < 20 IU/mL, 
ALT normal and ALT normalisation, HBsAg loss and seroconversion, and HBeAg loss and 
seroconversion. Tenofovir alafenamide was non-inferior in the proportion of patients with HBV DNA 
≥ 20 IU/mL at Week 48 when compared to tenofovir disoproxil as assessed by the modified US FDA 
Snapshot algorithm. Treatment outcomes (HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL by missing=failure) at Week 48 
between treatment groups were similar across subgroups by age, sex, race, baseline HBeAg status, and 
ALT. 
Treatment outcomes of Study 4018 at Week 48 and Week 96 are presented in Table 7 and Table 8.

Changes in bone mineral density in Study 4018 
The mean percentage change in BMD from baseline to Week 48 as assessed by DXA was +1.7% with 
tenofovir alafenamide compared to −0.1% with tenofovir disoproxil at the lumbar spine and +0.7% 
compared to −0.5% at the total hip. BMD declines of greater than 3% at the lumbar spine were 
experienced by 4% of tenofovir alafenamide patients and 17% of tenofovir disoproxil patients at Week 
48. BMD declines of greater than 3% at the total hip were experienced by 2% of tenofovir alafenamide 
patients and 12% of tenofovir disoproxil patients at Week 48. 
In the open-label phase, mean percentage change in BMD from baseline to Week 96 in patients who 
remained on tenofovir alafenamide was +2.3% at the lumbar spine and +1.2% at the total hip, 
compared to +1.7% at the lumbar spine and +0.2% at the total hip in those who switched from 
tenofovir disoproxil to tenofovir alafenamide at Week 48. 
Changes in renal laboratory tests in Study 4018 
The median change from baseline to Week 48 in eGFR by Cockcroft-Gault method was +2.2 mL per 
minute in the tenofovir alafenamide group and −1.7 mL per minute in those receiving tenofovir 
disoproxil. At Week 48, there was a median increase from baseline in serum creatinine among patients 
randomised to continue treatment with tenofovir disoproxil (0.01 mg/dL) compared with a median 
decrease from baseline among those who were switched to tenofovir alafenamide (−0.01 mg/dL).  
In the open-label phase, the median change in eGFR from baseline to Week 96 was 1.6 mL/min in 
patients who remained on tenofovir alafenamide, compared to +0.5 mL/min in patients who switched 
from tenofovir disoproxil to tenofovir alafenamide at Week 48. The median change in serum 
creatinine from baseline to Week 96 was −0.02 mg/dL in those who remained on tenofovir 
alafenamide, compared to −0.01 mg/dL in those who switched from tenofovir disoproxil to tenofovir 
alafenamide at Week 48.

Renal and/or hepatic impairment Study 4035 
Study 4035 was an open-label clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of switching from 
another antiviral regimen to tenofovir alafenamide in virologically suppressed HBV-infected patients. 
Part A of the study included patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (eGFR by Cockcroft-
Gault method between 15 and 59 mL/min; Cohort 1, N = 78) or ESRD (eGFR by Cockcroft-Gault 
method < 15 mL/min) on hemodialysis (Cohort 2, N = 15). Part B of the study included patients 
(N = 31) with moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B or C at screening or a 
history of CPT score ≥ 7 with any CPT score ≤ 12 at screening).  
The primary endpoint was the proportion of patients with HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL at Week 24. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints at Weeks 24 and 96 included the proportion of patients with HBV DNA 
< 20 IU/mL and target detected/not detected (ie, < LLOD), the proportion of patients with biochemical 
response (normal ALT and normalised ALT), the proportion of patients with serological response (loss 
of HBsAg and seroconversion to anti-HBs and loss of HBeAg and seroconversion to anti-HBe in 
HBeAg-positive patients) and change from baseline in CPT and Model for End Stage Liver Disease 
(MELD) scores for hepatically impaired patients in Part B. 
Renally impaired adult patients in Study 4035, Part A  
At baseline, 98% (91/93) of patients in Part A had HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL and 66% (61/93) had an 
undetectable HBV DNA level. Median age was 65 years, 74% were male, 77% were Asian, 16% were 
White, and 83% were HBeAg-negative. The most commonly used HBV medication oral antivirals 
included tenofovir disoproxil (N = 58), lamivudine (N = 46), adefovir dipivoxil (N = 46), and 
entecavir (N = 43). At baseline, 97% and 95% of patients had ALT ≤ ULN based on central laboratory 
criteria and 2018 AASLD criteria, respectively; median eGFR by Cockcroft-Gault was 43.7 mL/min 
(45.7 mL/min in Cohort 1 and 7.32 mL/min in Cohort 2); and 34% of patients had a history of 
cirrhosis.

Changes in lipid laboratory tests in Study 4035 
Small median increases from baseline to Week 24 and Week 96 in total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, 
LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and total cholesterol to HDL ratio among patients with renal or hepatic 
impairment are consistent when compared with results observed from other studies involving switch to 
tenofovir alafenamide (see section 5.1 for Studies 108, 110 and 4018), whereas decreases from 
baseline in total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and total cholesterol to HDL ratio were 
observed in patients with ESRD on haemodialysis at Week 24 and Week 96. 
Paediatric population 
In Study 1092, the efficacy and safety of tenofovir alafenamide were evaluated in a randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study of treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced 
HBV-infected patients between the ages of 12 to < 18 years weighing ≥ 35 kg (Cohort 1; N=47 
tenofovir alafenamide, N=23 placebo), and 6 to < 12 years weighing ≥ 25 kg (Cohort 2 Group 1; N=12 
tenofovir alafenamide, N=6 placebo). Patients were randomised to receive tenofovir alafenamide or 
placebo to match once daily. Baseline demographics and HBV disease characteristics were 
comparable between the two treatment arms; 58% were male, 66% were Asian, and 25% were White; 
7%, 23%, 24%, and 44% had HBV genotype A, B, C, and D, respectively. Overall, 99% were HBeAg 
positive. At baseline, median HBV DNA was 8.1 log10 IU/mL, mean ALT was 107 U/L, median 
HBsAg was 4.5 log10 IU/mL. Previous treatment included oral antivirals (23%), including entecavir 
(N=10), lamivudine (N=12), and tenofovir disoproxil (N=3), and/or interferons (15%). After receiving 
double-blind treatment for 24 weeks (either tenofovir alafenamide or placebo), patients rolled over 
with no interruption in treatment to open-label tenofovir alafenamide. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with plasma HBV DNA < 20 IU/mL at 
Week 24. Additional efficacy endpoints included change from baseline in HBV DNA and ALT, ALT 
normalisation, HBeAg loss and seroconversion, and HBsAg loss and seroconversion. 
Treatment outcomes of Study 1092 at Week 24 and Week 48 are presented in Table 12 and Table 13.

Changes in bone mineral density in Study 1092 
Among the patients treated with tenofovir alafenamide and placebo, the mean percent increase in 
BMD from baseline to Week 24 was +1.6% (N=48) and +1.9% (N=23) for lumbar spine, and +1.9% 
(N=50) and +2.0% (N=23) for whole body, respectively. At Week 24, mean changes from baseline 
BMD Z-scores were +0.01 and -0.07 for lumbar spine, and -0.04 and -0.04 for whole body, for the 
tenofovir alafenamide and placebo groups, respectively. 
In the open-label phase, mean percentage increase in BMD from baseline to Week 48 for lumbar spine 
and whole body was +3.8% (N=52) and +3.0% (N=54) in patients who remained on tenofovir 
alafenamide, compared to +2.8% (N=27) and +3.7% (N=27) in those who switched from placebo to 
tenofovir alafenamide at Week 24, respectively. At Week 48, mean changes from baseline 
BMD-Z scores for lumbar spine and whole body were -0.05 and -0.15 for patients who remained on 
tenofovir alafenamide, compared to -0.12 and -0.07 for those who switched to tenofovir alafenamide, 
respectively. 
BMD declines of 4% or greater at lumbar spine and whole body at Week 24 and Week 48 are 
presented in Table 14.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following oral administration of tenofovir alafenamide under fasted conditions in adult patients with 
chronic hepatitis B, peak plasma concentrations of tenofovir alafenamide were observed 
approximately 0.48 hours post-dose. Based on Phase 3 population pharmacokinetic analysis in patients 
with chronic hepatitis B, mean steady state AUC0-24 for tenofovir alafenamide (N = 698) and tenofovir 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(N = 856) were 0.22 µg•h/mL and 0.32 µg•h/mL, respectively. Steady state Cmax for tenofovir 
alafenamide and tenofovir were 0.18 and 0.02 µg/mL, respectively. Relative to fasting conditions, the 
administration of a single dose of tenofovir alafenamide with a high fat meal resulted in a 
65% increase in tenofovir alafenamide exposure. 
Distribution 
The binding of tenofovir alafenamide to human plasma proteins in samples collected during clinical 
studies was approximately 80%. The binding of tenofovir to human plasma proteins is less than 0.7% 
and is independent of concentration over the range of 0.01-25 µg/mL. 
Biotransformation 
Metabolism is a major elimination pathway for tenofovir alafenamide in humans, accounting for 
> 80% of an oral dose. In vitro studies have shown that tenofovir alafenamide is metabolised to 
tenofovir (major metabolite) by carboxylesterase-1 in hepatocytes; and by cathepsin A in peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and macrophages. In vivo, tenofovir alafenamide is hydrolysed 
within cells to form tenofovir (major metabolite), which is phosphorylated to the active metabolite, 
tenofovir diphosphate. 
In vitro, tenofovir alafenamide is not metabolised by CYP1A2, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, or 
CYP2D6. Tenofovir alafenamide is minimally metabolised by CYP3A4. 
Elimination 
Renal excretion of intact tenofovir alafenamide is a minor pathway with < 1% of the dose eliminated 
in urine. Tenofovir alafenamide is mainly eliminated following metabolism to tenofovir. Tenofovir 
alafenamide and tenofovir have a median plasma half-life of 0.51 and 32.37 hours, respectively. 
Tenofovir is renally eliminated from the body by the kidneys by both glomerular filtration and active 
tubular secretion. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Tenofovir alafenamide exposures are dose proportional over the dose range of 8 to 125 mg. 
Pharmacokinetics in special populations 
Age, gender and ethnicity 
No clinically relevant differences in pharmacokinetics according to age or ethnicity have been 
identified. Differences in pharmacokinetics according to gender were not considered to be clinically 
relevant. 
Hepatic impairment 
In patients with severe hepatic impairment, total plasma concentrations of tenofovir alafenamide and 
tenofovir are lower than those seen in patients with normal hepatic function. When corrected for 
protein binding, unbound (free) plasma concentrations of tenofovir alafenamide in severe hepatic 
impairment and normal hepatic function are similar. 
Renal impairment 
No clinically relevant differences in tenofovir alafenamide or tenofovir pharmacokinetics were 
observed between healthy patients and patients with severe renal impairment (estimated CrCl > 15 but 
< 30 mL/min) in studies of tenofovir alafenamide (Table 15). 
Exposures of tenofovir in patients with ESRD (estimated creatinine clearance < 15 mL/min) on 
chronic haemodialysis who received tenofovir alafenamide (N = 5) were substantially higher than in 
patients with normal renal function (Table 15). No clinically relevant differences in tenofovir 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
alafenamide pharmacokinetics were observed in patients with ESRD on chronic haemodialysis as 
compared to those with normal renal function.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical studies in rats and dogs revealed bone and kidney as the primary target organs of toxicity. 
Bone toxicity was observed as reduced BMD in rats and dogs at tenofovir exposures at least four times 
greater than those expected after administration of tenofovir alafenamide. A minimal infiltration of 
histiocytes was present in the eye in dogs at tenofovir alafenamide and tenofovir exposures of 
approximately 4 and 17 times greater, respectively, than those expected after administration of 
tenofovir alafenamide. 
Tenofovir alafenamide was not mutagenic or clastogenic in conventional genotoxic assays. 
Because there is a lower tenofovir exposure in rats and mice after tenofovir alafenamide 
administration compared to tenofovir disoproxil, carcinogenicity studies and a rat peri-postnatal study 
were conducted only with tenofovir disoproxil. No special hazard for humans was revealed in 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conventional studies of carcinogenic potential with tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate) and toxicity to 
reproduction and development with tenofovir disoproxil (as fumarate) or tenofovir alafenamide. 
Reproductive toxicity studies in rats and rabbits showed no effects on mating, fertility, pregnancy or 
foetal parameters. However, tenofovir disoproxil reduced the viability index and weight of pups in a 
peri-postnatal toxicity study at maternally toxic doses. A long-term oral carcinogenicity study in mice 
showed a low incidence of duodenal tumours, considered likely related to high local concentrations in 
the gastrointestinal tract at the high dose of 600 mg/kg/day. The mechanism of tumour formation in 
mice and potential relevance for humans is uncertain.

Contents of the pack and other information 
If Vemlidy has been prescribed for your child, please note that all the information in this leaflet 
is addressed to your child (in this case please read “your child” instead of “you”). 
1.  What Vemlidy is and what it is used for 
Vemlidy contains the active substance tenofovir alafenamide. This is an antiviral medicine, known as 
a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NtRTI). 
Vemlidy is used to treat chronic (long-term) hepatitis B in adults and children 6 years of age and 
older, who weigh at least 25 kg. Hepatitis B is an infection affecting the liver, caused by the 
hepatitis B virus. In patients with hepatitis B, this medicine controls the infection by stopping the virus 
from multiplying. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Vemlidy 
Do not take Vemlidy 
• 
if you are allergic to tenofovir alafenamide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
 If this applies to you, do not take Vemlidy and tell your doctor immediately. 
Warnings and precautions 
• 
• 
Take care not to pass on your hepatitis B to other people. You can still infect others when 
taking this medicine. This medicine does not reduce the risk of passing on hepatitis B to others 
through sexual contact or blood contamination. You must continue to take precautions to avoid 
this. Discuss with your doctor the precautions needed to avoid infecting others.  
Tell your doctor if you have a history of liver disease. Patients with liver disease, who are 
treated for hepatitis B with antiviral medicines, have a higher risk of severe and potentially fatal 
liver complications. Your doctor may need to carry out blood tests to monitor your liver 
function.

• 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist if you have had kidney disease or if tests have shown 
problems with your kidneys, before or during treatment. Before starting treatment and 
during treatment with Vemlidy, your doctor may order blood or urine tests to monitor how your 
kidneys work. 
Talk to your doctor if you also have hepatitis C or D. This medicine has not been tested on 
patients who have hepatitis C or D as well as hepatitis B. 
Talk to your doctor if you also have HIV. If you are not sure whether you have HIV, your 
doctor should offer you HIV testing before you start taking this medicine for hepatitis B. 
 If any of these apply to you, talk to your doctor before taking Vemlidy. 
There is a possibility that you may experience kidney problems when taking Vemlidy over a long 
period of time (see Warnings and precautions). 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children who are under 6 years old, or weighing less than 25 kg. It 
has not been tested in children aged less than 6 years old or weighing less than 25 kg. 
Bone problems. Loss of bone mass has been reported in some children who received Vemlidy. The 
effects on long-term bone health and future fracture risk in children are uncertain. Your doctor will 
monitor this possible risk. Tell your doctor if any bone pain or fractures occur. 
Other medicines and Vemlidy 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicine. Vemlidy may interact with other medicines. As a result, the amounts of Vemlidy or other 
medicines in your blood may change. This may stop your medicines from working properly, or may 
make any side effects worse.

your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.

3. 
How to take Vemlidy 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or 
pharmacist if you are not sure. 
The recommended dose is one tablet once a day with food. It is best to take Vemlidy with food to get 
the right levels of active substance in your body. Treatment should continue for as long as your doctor 
tells you. Usually this is for at least 6 to 12 months and may be for many years. 
If you take more Vemlidy than you should 
If you accidentally take more than the recommended dose of Vemlidy you may be at increased risk of 
experiencing possible side effects with this medicine (see section 4, Possible side effects). 
Contact your doctor or nearest emergency department immediately for advice. Keep the tablet bottle 
with you so that you can easily describe what you have taken. 
If you forget to take Vemlidy 
It is important not to miss a dose. If you do miss a dose, work out how long since you should have 
taken it. 
• 
• 
If it is less than 18 hours after you usually take Vemlidy, take it as soon as you can, and then 
take your next dose at its regular time. 
If it is more than 18 hours after you usually take Vemlidy, then do not take the missed dose. 
Wait and take the next dose at the regular time. Do not take a double dose to make up for a 
forgotten tablet. 
If you are sick (vomit) less than 1 hour after taking Vemlidy, take another tablet. You do not need 
to take another tablet if you are sick (vomit) more than 1 hour after taking Vemlidy.

If you stop taking Vemlidy 
Do not stop taking Vemlidy without your doctor’s advice. Stopping treatment with Vemlidy may 
cause your hepatitis B to get worse. In some patients with advanced liver disease or cirrhosis, this 
could be life-threatening. If you stop taking this medicine, you will need regular health checks and 
blood tests for several months to check your hepatitis B infection. 
• 
• 
• 
Talk to your doctor before you stop taking this medicine for any reason, particularly if you are 
experiencing any side effects or you have another illness. 
Tell your doctor immediately about new or unusual symptoms after you stop treatment, 
particularly symptoms you associate with hepatitis B infection. 
Talk to your doctor before you restart taking Vemlidy tablets. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

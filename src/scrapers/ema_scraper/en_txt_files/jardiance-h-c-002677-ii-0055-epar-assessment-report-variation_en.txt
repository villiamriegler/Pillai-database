1.  Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Boehringer Ingelheim International 
GmbH submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 13 October 2020 an application for a Type II 
variation. 
The following changes were proposed: 
Variation requested 
Type 
C.I.6.a  
C.I.6.a - Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of 
a new therapeutic indication or modification of an approved 
one 
Type II 
Annexes 
affected 
I, IIIA and IIIB 
Extension of the indication to include treatment of adult patients with heart failure and reduced ejection 
fraction for Jardiance; as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 4.9 and 5.1 of the SmPC are 
updated. This is based on final results from the EMPEROR HFrEF study, a phase III randomised, double-
blind trial to evaluate efficacy and safety of once-daily empagliflozin 10 mg compared to placebo. The 
Package Leaflet and Labelling are updated in accordance. Version 15.0 of the RMP has also been 
submitted. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the list 
of local representatives in the Package Leaflet.  
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Labelling and 
Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included (an) EMA Decision(s) 
EMEA-000828-PIP05-17 on the granting of a (product-specific) waiver.  
The waiver applies to: 
•   all subsets of the paediatric population from birth to less than 18 years of age; 
• 
for film-coated tablet, oral use; 
•   on the grounds that the specific medicinal product is likely to be unsafe. 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
MAH request for additional market protection 
The MAH requested consideration of its application in accordance with Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) 
726/2004 - one year of market protection for a new indication.

3.  Scientific discussion 
3.1.  Introduction 
3.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition and claimed the therapeutic indication 
The MAH initially proposed the following extension of indication: 
Heart failure 
Jardiance is indicated in adult patients with heart failure (NYHA class II-IV) and reduced ejection fraction, 
with or without type 2 diabetes mellitus: 
- to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure 
- to slow kidney function decline 
This indication was modified by CMP during the procedure. 
Epidemiology and risk factors 
Heart failure (HF) has emerged as a global epidemic over the last decades and an estimated prevalence 
of >37.7 million individuals globally. In the United States alone, the prevalence is 5.7 million, and there 
are 670,000 new cases per year. The rise in cardiovascular risk factors, improved survival from ischaemic 
heart disease, as well as age distribution will contribute to a sustained increase in the prevalence of HF in 
developed high-income countries.  
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Chronic heart failure (HF) is a progressive syndrome characterized by the inability of the heart to provide 
adequate circulation to meet the metabolic demand of different tissues or do it at the expense of elevated 
left ventricular filling pressure. HF occurs due to failure of the heart to pump adequately (systolic 
dysfunction) and/or impaired relaxation (diastolic dysfunction). Two types of HF have been defined mainly 
based on the Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and also other structural changes in heart muscle: 
heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) <40% and heart failure with preserved ejection 
fraction (HFpEF) ≥50%. Patients with HF can clinically be classified according to the severity of their 
symptoms. The most commonly used classification system, the New York Heart Association (NYHA) 
Functional Classification, places patients in one of four categories based on how much they are limited 
during physical activity. The classes range from I, i.e. 0 limitation of physical activity, to IV, i.e. unable to 
carry on any physical activity without discomfort. The clinical course for HFrEF patients is often marked by 
acute episodes of clinical decompensation with increased symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, and 
oedema and in more severe cases cardiac asthma. The time in between these acute episodes can consist 
of periods with stability, but the normal progression of the disease is still associated with increasingly 
worsening symptoms, an increasing frequency of rehospitalizations, and ultimately a high rate of 
mortality. Approximately 50% of patients who develop HF die within 5 years after diagnosis. Annually, 
more than 1 million patients are hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of HF. HF is the most common 
cause of hospitalization among individuals above 65 years of age in the western countries. This worsening 
of chronic HF has been defined in the “2017 European Medicines Agency Guideline on clinical investigation 
of medicinal products for the treatment of chronic HF (EMA 2017)”.  
Management 
Standard medications for patients with HFrEF and medium-to-severe chronic HF (NYHA classes II to IV) 
are well established and based on large randomized, controlled trials, with the results incorporated into 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/275072/2021 
Page 12/96 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
guidelines issued by the ACCF/AHA and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). The standard 
medications include an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or/and an angiotensin receptor 
blocker (ARB), beta-blocker, angiotensin-receptor-neprilysin-inhibitor (ARNIs) and a diuretic in patients 
with evidence of fluid retention. An aldosterone receptor antagonist may be given, especially those who 
have experienced an acute myocardial infarction or have a history of diabetes mellitus. Despite 
considerable advances in the therapy of HF patients, even in patients on optimized therapy the normal 
progression of the disease is, as described above, still associated with increasingly worsening symptoms, 
an increasing frequency of rehospitalizations and a high rate of mortality.  
Studies investigating the effect of sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT 2) inhibitors observed beneficial 
effects on HF-related complications in patients with or without diabetes. Empagliflozin is an orally 
administered SGLT-2 inhibitor and is approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 
worldwide. The results of trial 1245.25 (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) in patients with T2DM and established CV 
disease showed that empagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure (HHF) 
and the composite endpoint of HHF or CV death.  
3.1.2.  About the product 
Empagliflozin (Jardiance) is an orally administered, potent and selective inhibitor of the human sodium-
glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT 2) developed by Boehringer Ingelheim (BI). By inhibition of SGLT 2 in the 
kidneys empagliflozin reduces the reabsorption of glucose by the kidneys leading to increased urinary 
glucose excretion and, in consequence, to a lowering of blood glucose. Empagliflozin is approved for the 
treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) worldwide as an adjunct therapy to diet and exercise to 
improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. In the United States and several other 
countries, it is also approved to reduce the risk of cardiovascular (CV) death in patients with T2DM and 
established CV disease. The results of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial (Empagliflozin Cardiovascular 
Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients) significantly improved the primary composite 
cardiovascular outcome (MACE-3) and significantly reduced cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart 
failure (HHF) as well as death from any cause as compared to standard of care. These beneficial 
cardiovascular effects were found to be largely independent of the glucose-lowering effect of 
empagliflozin.  
Empagliflozin exerts its effect by preventing sodium and glucose reabsorption. While natriuresis will be 
compensated within days of drug administration through changes in tubulo-glomerular feedback, 
glucosuria will last for as long as the medication is used. This leads to long-lasting hemodynamic changes 
associated with modest osmotic diuresis, blood pressure lowering effect, improvement in arterial stiffness, 
reduction in oxidative stress, and decrease in rate pressure product, an indirect measure of myocardial 
oxygen demands, with no increase in HR and no effect on sympathetic nerve activity. The non-glycosuric 
physiological and hemodynamic adaptations under empagliflozin may, therefore provide benefits for 
patients with HF with or without diabetes. 
Based on the results of trial 1245.25 (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) in patients with T2DM and established CV 
disease, BI initiated a phase III program for empagliflozin 10 mg once daily in chronic heart failure 
regardless of diabetes status, including two pivotal CV outcome trials (“EMPEROR”), two functional 
capacity trials (“EMPERIAL”), and a mechanistic phase III trial (“EMPA-VISION”) in patients with HFrEF 
(reduced ejection fraction) and HFpEF (preserved ejection fraction). 
3.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The development programme 
The EMPEROR trials are pivotal outcome trials that investigate the long-term effect of empagliflozin in 
reducing the risk of hospitalisation for HF and of cardiovascular death in patients with heart failure. The 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/275072/2021 
Page 13/96 
 
 
  
  
 
EMPERIAL trials are additional trials that investigated the short-term (12 weeks) effect of empagliflozin on 
functional capacity, signs and symptoms of heart failure and quality of life. The EMPA-VISION trial is a 
supporting trial investigating the short-term (12 weeks) effects of empagliflozin on mechanistic cardiac 
physiology and metabolism. 
The EMPEROR-reduced trial (1245.121) and the EMPERIAL trials (1245.168 and 1245.167) have been 
completed, and the clinical trial reports are available.  
EMPA-VISION (1245.148) had been completed clinically, and the reporting of results is ongoing.  
The EMPEROR-preserved trial (1245.110) is still ongoing. 
Compliance with CHMP guidance 
The most relevant CHMP guideline is “Clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of 
chronic heart failure” (CPMP/EWP/235/95, Rev.2). The compliance with this guideline is addressed in the 
discussion of the design of the trial.  
Scientific advice 
In general, the EMPEROR trial was conducted according to the scientific advice from the CHMP on 
10 November 2016 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/715730/2016) and on 20 July 2017 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/432773/2017). However, although the CHMP recommended not to use the eGFR slope 
as a key secondary endpoint, in the current application the eGFR slope was included as such. From a 
clinical perspective, the CHMP considers this approach questionable and the proposed slope analysis is not 
acceptable from a statistical perspective. Such a modelling exercise would be more suitable for providing 
supportive descriptive information on renal progression rather than key statistical evidence. CHMP 
recommended it to be better placed outside of the testing hierarchy.

3.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
3.2.1.  Pharmacology 
Empagliflozin is a potent and selective inhibitor of the human sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT 2). 
By inhibition of SGLT 2 in the kidneys empagliflozin reduces the reabsorption of glucose by the kidney 
leading to increased urinary glucose excretion and in consequence to a lowering of blood glucose in 
patients with diabetes mellitus and healthy subjects. 
In the clinical EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial empagliflozin significantly improved the primary composite 
cardiovascular outcome (MACE-3) and significantly reduced cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart 
failure (HHF) as well as death from any cause as compared to standard of care. These beneficial 
cardiovascular effects were found to be largely independent of the glucose-lowering effect of 
empagliflozin.

Upon these results, effects of empagliflozin on the pathophysiological processes in the cardiovascular 
system were studied. Studies were done in various pharmacological experimental settings, in particular in 
models of heart failure induced by different stimuli. These experiments were performed in different 
species like mice, rats and pigs. Importantly, studies were done in normoglycemic animals as well as 
animals with pre-existing diabetes in order to reproduce aspects of the beneficial results observed in the 
clinical studies and to investigate the mode of action of empagliflozin on the cardiovascular system. 
In vitro empagliflozin significantly improved the myocardial stiffness both in tissue from end-stage HF 
patients as well as from mice with diabetic cardiomyopathy in vitro. The effects of empagliflozin may be 
mediated by a restoration of myofilament phosphorylation. In diabetic, hypertensive rats empagliflozin 
preserved endothelial function ex vivo, while a deterioration was observed in blood vessels taken from 
the sham-treated control group. The exact molecular mechanism of empagliflozin in these in vitro / ex 
vivo models, however, remains unclear. 
In vivo, in diabetic animals, empagliflozin significantly ameliorated cardiac remodelling as shown by 
reduced cardiac and peri-coronary arterial fibrosis and LV mass/BW ratios. Further empagliflozin exerted 
anti-inflammatory properties and reduced cardiac oxidative stress by restoring levels of endogenous 
antioxidants. Impaired vascular endothelial function was restored. Cardiac energy supply was improved 
by empagliflozin. This beneficial effect correlated with increased plasma ketone levels. More importantly, 
empagliflozin restored parameters of cardiac function in rodent models of type 2 diabetes mellitus. 
Effects of empagliflozin have been additionally investigated in pharmacological models using animals 
without diabetes mellitus. 
In doxorubicin-induced heart failure empagliflozin reduced cardiac remodelling and improved cardiac 
function in mice. Empagliflozin increased the plasma levels of ß-hydroxybutyrate that demonstrated anti-
oxidative effects, cardiomyocytes in vitro. In rats with permanent coronary artery ligation empagliflozin 
prevented the progressive deterioration of cardiac function. Further cardiac remodelling was prevented 
and oxidative stress reduced. ATP levels were increased in an empagliflozin treated group compared to 
sham-treated controls. Empagliflozin increased plasma levels of ketone bodies and increased cardiac 
ketone utilization. Empagliflozin-treated pigs had higher myocardial ATP compared to sham-treated 
controls. Thus, in these preclinical studies, empagliflozin shifted the energy metabolism from glucose 
utilization to ketone bodies as an energy source resulting in improved myocardial ATP levels. 
Empagliflozin improved LV systolic and diastolic function and ameliorated cardiac in a model of myocardial 
infarction in pigs. The energy metabolism was switched from glucose toward ketone body utilization. 
Empagliflozin has shown beneficial effects on functional parameters of heart failure in different 
experimental settings in vitro and in vivo. In models of heart failure induced by myocardial infarction or 
doxorubicin injection empagliflozin improved left ventricular function and reduced cardiac remodelling in 
different species. The failing heart appears to have an energy deficit; interestingly empagliflozin has been 
shown to improve energy supply to the organ. Moderately increased plasma levels of ketone bodies have 
been described in clinical studies. These ketone bodies are described as an alternative energy source for 
various organs, including the heart. In the reviewed studies, empagliflozin has been shown to moderately 
increase plasma levels of ketones in vivo. This source of energy supply might contribute to the beneficial 
effects of empagliflozin in patients with heart failure. 
SGLT2 transporter protein has been detected in the proximal tubules of the kidneys of humans and 
animals. Inhibition of these transporters leads to glucosuria, the relevant mode of action of empagliflozin 
in the treatment of diabetes mellitus. SGLT2 receptors have recently been detected on cardiac endothelial 
cells under stress conditions in rats. Expression of these transporters under various stress conditions are 
presently under investigation and may help to explain the effects of empagliflozin beyond glucosuria. 
Empagliflozin also reduces sodium reabsorption and increases the delivery of sodium to the distal tubule. 
By activation of the tubule-glomerular feedback, this may influence several physiological functions 
including, but not restricted to, lowering both pre-and afterload of the heart and downregulation of 
sympathetic activity.

A concern was raised about a concomitant use of GLP-1 receptor agonists blunting the SGLT-2 inhibitor-
induced hyperketonaemia, thus reducing empagliflozin efficacy for HF. The MAH stated that in the study 
of Ferranini et al. (2020), patients receiving a GLP-1 receptor agonist exenatide demonstrated a 
decreased plasma ketone levels compared to the baseline, which was counterbalanced by a concomitant 
use of a SGLT-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin in the combination arm of the study. Patients treated with both 
substances showed overall neutral effects on β-hydroxybutyrate levels. In the same study, the SGLT-2 
inhibitor induced a moderate increase in haematocrit which was not impacted by the concomitant GLP-1 
receptor agonist use. It has been suggested that SGLT-2 inhibition with empagliflozin may stimulate 
erythropoiesis via an early increase in erythropoietin production, which may contribute to improved 
myocardial tissue oxygenation and reduced left ventricular mass in the patients.  
The precise molecular mechanisms of these effects are still not fully elucidated, and it is not clear which 
of these mechanisms are of clinical relevance or which one would be the dominant one, but this can be 
accepted.  
Taken together, empagliflozin demonstrated beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system in vitro and in 
vivo in animals with or without diabetes mellitus. These results are supportive with regards to the use of 
empagliflozin as a medication for patients with heart failure. 
The beneficial effects of empagliflozin on the cardiovascular system have been shown in normoglycemic 
animals and animals with diabetes mellitus. This mirrors data shown in clinical studies. 
The following statement will be included in Section 5.1 of SmPC: “Empagliflozin also reduces sodium 
reabsorption and increases the delivery of sodium to the distal tubule. This may influence several 
physiological functions including, but not restricted to, increasing tubuloglomerular feedback and reducing 
intraglomerular pressure, lowering both pre- and afterload of the heart, and downregulating of 
sympathetic activity.”  
3.2.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) for empagliflozin was submitted with the initial MAA and an 
updated ERA after completion of an additional study. The risk assessment resulted in the conclusion that 
no significant impact on the environment is expected. 
In the current ERA, the estimation of the predicted environmental concentration (PEC) of empagliflozin in 
the various environmental compartments is based on the default market penetration factor (Fpen = 
0.01), as provided in the EMA guideline, and the highest maximum daily dose of 25 mg. The 
recommended maximum daily dose of the newly proposed indication (chronic heart failure) will only be 
10 mg. 
The default Fpen is based on a very conservative worst-case estimation, meaning that 1% of all EU 
inhabitants are treated 365 d/a with the recommended maximum daily dose. The market penetration 
factor was not refined though, e.g. by using the much smaller actual amount of substance placed on the 
market. 
Therefore, the effects on the environment by adding the indication chronic heart failure with a much 
smaller patient group are considered negligible and well covered by the used Fpen. 
Hence, the ERA submitted with the initial MAA remains valid for the current type II variation application 
covering the additional proposed indication.

3.2.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Additional information has been provided on the pharmacologic effects on the cardiovascular system. 
Although several factors have been mentioned that may contribute to the positive actions of empagliflozin 
on heart function, the precise molecular mechanisms of these effects are not clear. The MAH suggested 
that SGLT-2 inhibition by empagliflozin reduces sodium reabsorption and increases the delivery of sodium 
to the distal tubule. This may influence several physiological functions including, but not restricted to, 
increasing tubuloglomerular feedback and reducing intraglomerular pressure, lowering both pre- and 
afterload of the heart, and downregulating of sympathetic activity. Furthermore, the empagliflozin-
induced increase in ketone bodies may play a role by increasing an uptake and oxidization of β-
hydroxybutyrate by the heart resulting in an improved energy supply. The increase in plasma ketone 
bodies induced by SGLT2 inhibitors is in general mild and does usually not exceed the physiological 
range. It has also been suggested that SGLT-2 inhibition with empagliflozin may stimulate erythropoiesis 
via an early increase in erythropoietin production, which may contribute to improved myocardial tissue 
oxygenation and reduced left ventricular mass in the patients.  
It is currently not clear which of the numerous potential mechanisms of action are of clinical relevance or 
which one would be the dominant one. The proposed mechanisms have been supported by the literature 
data and are considered acceptable.

It is agreed with the MAH that the ERA conclusions, based on the previous ERA of empagliflozin remain 
unchanged. The MAH has provided an updated ERA table, including new calculations for all proposed 
indications of Jardiance. Hereby, the ERA data for Jardiance is considered complete.   
3.2.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Although several factors have been mentioned that may contribute to the positive actions of empagliflozin 
on heart function, the precise molecular mechanisms of these effects are not clear.  Several possible 
mechanisms may play a role, such as a reduced sodium readsorption in the proximal tubules, resulting in 
reduced intraflomerular pressure and lowered cardiac pre- and afterload; increased level of ketone 
bodies, improving cardiac energy supply by increasing cardiac uptake and oxidization of β-
hydroxybutyrate; and increased erythropoiesis which may contribute to improved myocardial tissue 
oxygenation and reduced left ventricular mass in the patients. It is currently not clear which of the 
numerous potential mechanisms of action are of clinical relevance or which one would be the dominant 
one. The provided information is endorsed.  
The following statement will be included in Section 5.1 of SmPC: “Empagliflozin also reduces sodium 
reabsorption and increases the delivery of sodium to the distal tubule. This may influence several 
physiological functions including, but not restricted to, increasing tubuloglomerular feedback and reducing 
intraglomerular pressure, lowering both pre- and afterload of the heart, and downregulating of 
sympathetic activity.”  
It is agreed with the MAH that the ERA conclusions, based on the previous ERA of empagliflozin remain 
unchanged. An updated ERA table, including new calculations for all proposed indications of Jardiance, 
has been provided. The DT50-values for total system, sediment and for empagliflozin and the relevant 
transformation products M3, M1 and M12 are included in the updated ERA as well as the proposed 
molecular structures of M3 and M1. It is also mentioned in the ERA that M3 is proposed to be a 
stereoisomer of the active substance empagliflozin and thus might be pharmacologically active. In 
addition, it is mentioned that M3 is very persistent in the sediment (DT50 > 180 days) and M12 is 
persistent in water (DT50 > 40 days).

GCP 
According to the MAH, the trials were carried out in compliance with the CTP, in accordance with the 
principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, in accordance with the ICH GCP, and in accordance with 
applicable regulatory requirements and BI’s standard operating procedures. 
3.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Based on the results of trial 1245.25 (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) in patients with T2D and established 
cardiovascular (CV) disease, a phase 3 program was initiated for empagliflozin 10 mg once daily in 
patients with chronic heart failure regardless of diabetes status. This included two pivotal CV outcome 
trials (“EMPEROR”), two functional capacity trials (“EMPERIAL”) and a mechanistic phase III trial (“EMPA-

VISION”) in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) and preserved ejection 
fraction (HFpEF).  
As a measure of systemic drug exposure to empagliflozin, steady-state trough pharmacokinetic samples 
were taken in the EMPEROR-reduced trial in a subset of patients. This trial was a phase 3 randomised, 
double-blind trial that evaluated the efficacy and safety of once-daily empagliflozin 10 mg compared to 
placebo in patients with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). Randomisation was 
stratified by geographical region, history of diabetes mellitus, and eGFR (based on chronic kidney disease 
epidemiology collaboration (CKD-EPI) formula). Pre-dose samples were collected at week 12 (day 85) to 
determine steady-state plasma trough concentrations. Samples outside the planned time window of 22 to 
26h after dosing were excluded from the descriptive analysis. The effect of demographic and baseline 
characteristics, including sex, age, body weight, body mass index (BMI), geographical region, investigator 
country, race, ethnicity, renal impairment, New York Heart Association (NYHA) classification, heart failure 
physiology (based on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and N-terminal prohormone of brain 
natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP)) and diabetes status on empagliflozin trough concentrations was also 
investigated descriptively.  
The pharmacokinetics results are presented below, including a comparison with the pharmacokinetics 
observed in other phase 3 trials.

A total of 915 pre-dose samples were collected (438 in placebo group and 477 in empagliflozin group). A 
total of 308 empagliflozin trough concentrations were summarised descriptively. The geometric mean 
(Coefficient of Variation (CV)) steady state trough concentration are summarised in Table 2.

The geometric mean steady-state trough concentration of empagliflozin 10 mg in trial 1245.121 was 
approximately 2-fold higher than that of empagliflozin 10 mg in the previous phase 3 trials in patients 
with T2D, but was lower or similar to those of empagliflozin 25 mg (Table 3 and Table 4).

To understand the potential reason(s) for the relatively higher empagliflozin exposure observed in 
patients with HFrEF, the MAH conducted a comparison between trial 1245.121 and trial 1245.25. The 
demographic and baseline characteristics between patients in trial 1245.121 and trial 1245.25 were 
different with respect to race, eGFR, age, body weight, and BMI (Table 5).

1245.121 were always higher (1.35 to 2.76-fold) than those of empagliflozin 10 mg in trial 1245.25, and 
were lower or similar (0.42 to 1.00-fold) to those of empagliflozin 25 mg in trial 1245.25.

Table 7 Fold differences in the geometric mean steady state trough concentrations of 
empagliflozin trial 1245.121 with respect to those in trial 1245.25 for different subgroups.  
Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to compare (log-transformed) steady-state trough 
concentrations of empagliflozin 10 mg in 1245.121 versus empagliflozin 10 mg in 1245.25, adjusting for 
multiple demographic and baseline characteristics simultaneously. In this analysis, a stepwise selection 
method was first used to select predictor covariates one at a time to fit the best generalized linear model. 
Body weight and eGFR were selected as the predictor covariates. The other tested covariates, including 
age, BMI, race, ethnicity, sex, smoking status, alcohol use, liver function enzymes (alanine transaminase, 
aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase), total protein were not selected, suggesting that they were 
not important in describing the differences between trial 1245.121 and trial 1245.25 once eGFR and body 
weight were included in the model. 
After adjusting for eGFR and body weight, the difference in geometric empagliflozin steady-state trough 
concentration between trial 1245.121 and trial 1245.25 was reduced to 1.47-fold [95% confidence 
interval (CI): 1.33, 1.63]. The remaining 1.47-fold difference between trial 1245.121 and trial 1245.25 in 
empagliflozin steady-state trough exposure is not clear. The possibility of slightly altered empagliflozin PK 
due to changes in physiology induced by heart failure disease cannot be ruled out. 
Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was also performed for patients with both T2DM and heart failure 
conditions in trial 1245.121 and trial 1245.25. In this subset of patients, body weight and eGFR were also 
selected as the predictor covariates, and after adjusting for eGFR and body weight, the difference in 
gMean steady-state trough concentration of empagliflozin between trial 1245.121 and trial 1245.25 was 
reduced to 1.53-fold [95% CI: 1.26, 1.85]. 
No clear differences were observed for sex, race, ethnicity, geographic region, NYHA classification or 
heart physiology stratifications. Also, no major differences are identified by diabetes status.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Sacubitril/valsartan was used in approximately 20% of the randomized patients in trial 1245.121 since 
the beginning of the trial but was not used in trial 1245.25. Sacubitril was reported to be an OATP1B1 
and OATP1B3 inhibitor, whereas empagliflozin is a substrate of OATP1B1 and OATP1B3. Patients 
with/without sacubitril/valsartan had, however, similar empagliflozin trough concentrations (Figure 1). 
Figure 1  Steady state trough concentration of empagliflozin 10 mg in trial 1245.121 by use of 
ARNi at baseline 
No clear difference between patients with or without sacubitril/valsartan in the trough concentration of 
empagliflozin can be observed. Therefore, any interaction appears not to be clinically relevant.  
3.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Empagliflozin is a reversible, highly potent (IC50 of 1.3 nmol) and selective competitive inhibitor of 
sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2). Empagliflozin does not inhibit other glucose transporters 
important for glucose transport into peripheral tissues and is 5000 times more selective for SGLT2 versus 
SGLT1, the major transporter responsible for glucose absorption in the gut. SGLT2 is highly expressed in 
the kidney, whereas expression in other tissues is absent or very low. It is responsible, as the 
predominant transporter, for the reabsorption of glucose from the glomerular filtrate back into the 
circulation. In patients with type 2 diabetes and hyperglycaemia, a higher amount of glucose is filtered 
and reabsorbed. 
Empagliflozin improves glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes by reducing renal glucose 
reabsorption. The amount of glucose removed by the kidney through this glucuronic mechanism is 
dependent on blood glucose concentration and GFR. Inhibition of SGLT2 in patients with type 2 diabetes 
and hyperglycaemia leads to excess glucose excretion in the urine. In addition, initiation of empagliflozin 
increases excretion of sodium, resulting in osmotic diuresis and reduced intravascular volume. 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/275072/2021 
Page 25/96 
 
 
  
  
 
 
In patients with type 2 diabetes, urinary glucose excretion increased immediately following the first dose 
of empagliflozin and is continuous over the 24-hour dosing interval. Increased urinary glucose excretion 
was maintained at the end of the 4-week treatment period, averaging approximately 78 g/day. Increased 
urinary glucose excretion resulted in an immediate reduction in plasma glucose levels in patients with 
type 2 diabetes.  
Empagliflozin improves both fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose levels. The mechanism of action of 
empagliflozin is independent of beta-cell function and insulin pathway, and this contributes to a low risk 
of hypoglycaemia. Improvement of surrogate markers of beta-cell function, including Homeostasis Model 
Assessment-β (HOMA-β) was noted. In addition, urinary glucose excretion triggers calorie loss, associated 
with body fat loss and body weight reduction. The glucosuria observed with empagliflozin is accompanied 
by diuresis, which may contribute to sustained and moderate reduction of blood pressure. 
Empagliflozin also reduces sodium reabsorption and increases the delivery of sodium to the distal tubule. 
This may influence several physiological functions including, but not restricted to, increasing 
tubuloglomerular feedback and reducing intraglomerular pressure, lowering both pre- and afterload of the 
heart, and downregulating of sympathetic activity. 
3.3.4.  Discussion and Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics in patients with HFrEF are clearly different from patients with T2D as almost a 
doubling in trough concentrations is observed. The differences can partly be explained by the difference in 
body weight and renal function between these populations. The trough concentrations, however, do not 
exceed the trough concentrations observed in T2D patients with the currently registered 25 mg dose. 
Therefore, no safety issues are to be expected as a result of this phenomenon. 
The MAH describes as pharmacodynamic properties that empagliflozin lowers both pre- and afterload of 
the heart by increasing the tubuloglomerular feedback and reducing intraglomerular pressure due to 
increased delivery of sodium to the distal tubule. This is added to the SmPC.  
The MAH provided an additional review of clinical data describing potential mechanism of action. Although 
uncertainties remain and the clinical study of Griffin et al. 2020 included a small number of subjects 
(n=20), the suggested mechanism of action described in the SmPC Section 5.1 are considered plausible 
and supported by these studies.  
Other suggested mechanisms i.e. change in ketone metabolism and/or increase in erythrocytes are not 
included in the SmPC as research is still ongoing.

3.3.7.  Main study(ies) 
The EMPEROR trials are phase III international, multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-
controlled, event-driven trials and are pivotal outcome trials that investigate the long-term effect of 
empagliflozin in reducing the risk of hospitalisation for HF and of cardiovascular death in patients with 
heart failure.  
The EMPERIAL trials are additional supportive trials that investigated the short-term (12 weeks) effect of 
empagliflozin on functional capacity, signs and symptoms of heart failure and quality of life.  
The EMPA-VISION trial is a supporting trial investigating the short-term (12 weeks) effects of 
empagliflozin on mechanistic cardiac physiology and metabolism. 
The EMPEROR-reduced trial (1245.121) and the EMPERIAL trials (1245.168 and 1245.167) have been 
completed, and the clinical trial reports are available.  
EMPA-VISION (1245.148) had been completed clinically, and the reporting of results is ongoing.  
The EMPEROR-preserved trial (1245.110) is still ongoing.  
Based on the results of the pivotal trial 1245.121, BI sought a new indication for empagliflozin to reduce 
the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalisation for heart failure and to slow kidney function decline in 
adult patients with heart failure (NYHA class II-IV) with reduced ejection fraction. 
This section summarises the efficacy results from the EMPEROR-reduced (1245.121) and the EMPERIAL 
trials (1245.168 and 1245.167).

BI initiated a Phase III program for empagliflozin 10 mg once daily in chronic heart failure regardless of 
diabetes status. There are two CV outcome trials (“EMPEROR”), two functional capacity trials 
(“EMPERIAL”), and a mechanistic Phase III trial (“EMPA-VISION”) in patients with HFrEF (reduced ejection 
fraction) and HFpEF (preserved ejection fraction).  
All 5 trials are placebo-controlled, randomised (empagliflozin 10 mg to placebo 1:1), double-blind, and 
parallel-group by design (Table 8).

Treatments 
In the EMPEROR trial, all the patients were receiving appropriate treatments for heart failure, including 
diuretics, inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system and neprilysin, beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid 
receptor antagonists, and, when indicated, cardiac devices. The design of the study included a screening 
period of 4-28 days, a randomized, double-blind treatment period (event-driven study duration), in which 
eligible patients started with 10 mg empagliflozin or matching placebo. The median follow up was 16 
months of treatment. After the end of treatment, a follow-up period was used in which each subject will 
be followed for 30 days after the last treatment dose (see Figure 2). 
Figure 2 Study design CV outcome trials (“EMPEROR-Reduced/Preserved”) 
Objectives 
The aim of the EMPEROR-reduced trial is to investigate the safety and efficacy of empagliflozin versus 
placebo on top of guideline-directed medical therapy in patients with HFrEF.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The following endpoints were pre-specified for 1245.121: 
• 
• 
• 
Primary endpoint (confirmatory): the time to first event of adjudicated CV death or 
adjudicated HHF 
Key secondary endpoints (confirmatory): 
o  Occurrence of adjudicated HHF (first and recurrent) 
o  eGFR (CKD-EPI)cr slope of change from baseline

 , measured by two or more consecutive post-
baseline central laboratory measurements separated by at least 30 days (the first to last 
of the consecutive eGFR values), a reduction in eGFR from baseline of ≥40%, eGFR <15 
mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with baseline eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73 m2, or eGFR <10

o  Occurrence of all-cause hospitalisation (first and recurrent) 
Further endpoints (exploratory) include time to or occurrence of CV and/or renal events, 
progression or reversal of albuminuria, changes from baseline in eGFR, KCCQ scores, NYHA 
class, EQ-5D, NT-proBNP, albuminuria, body weight, blood pressure, pulse rate, HbA1c, FPG, 
etc.  
Sample size 
This was an event-based trial. For the sample size calculation, a yearly event rate in the placebo group of 
15% was assumed. The trial was designed to have a power of 90% for the primary endpoint at two-sided 
α of 0.05 to detect a hazard ratio of 0.8 between empagliflozin and placebo. Based on these assumptions, 
at least 841 confirmed primary events were to be observed and at least 2825 patients randomised and 
treated, given an accrual period of 18 months and a follow-up period of 20 months. The EMPEROR-
reduced trial (1245.121) included 3730 subjects.  
Randomisation and Blinding 
Subjects who fulfil all eligibility criteria were randomized double

Statistical methods 
The trial was designed to have a power of 90% for the primary endpoint at two-sided α of 0.05 to detect 
a hazard ratio of 0.8 between empagliflozin and placebo, which required at least 841 adjudicated primary 
endpoint events. After 544 events (planned approximately 500 events or about 60% of information), an 
interim analysis was performed by the independent Data monitoring committee (DMC). If the p-value for 
both the primary endpoint and for CV-death at the interim analysis were lower than α interim, the trial 
would be stopped for overwhelming efficacy. After the interim analysis, the DMC recommended 
continuing the trial as planned. The final α was therefore one-sided 0.0248, which was equivalent to two-
sided 0.0496. A hierarchical procedure (see Figure 3) was applied to the primary and key secondary 
endpoints. If a confirmatory endpoint was successful (i.e. empagliflozin superior to placebo), the α would 
be used for the subsequent step(s). If a confirmatory endpoint was not successful, all subsequent 
endpoints would be evaluated in an exploratory manner. After evaluation of the first key secondary 
endpoint (recurrent HHF), α was to be split into 0.001 (two-sided) for the analysis of eGFR slope, and the 
rest transferred to an efficacy meta-analysis. If the eGFR slope analysis was successful, the α of this 
branch would also be transferred to the meta-analysis.

If a test is successful (null hypothesis rejected), the corresponding alpha portion is maintained for the subsequent test. 
If a test is unsuccessful, the alpha portion is lost. 
Unless otherwise specified, efficacy analyses followed the ITT principle and included all randomised 
patients (RS; treatment assigned as randomised) and all available data up to the planned treatment 
discontinuation (including “off-treatment” data during unplanned treatment interruptions and after 
premature treatment discontinuations). Unless otherwise specified, the outcome events were based on 
adjudication results from the clinical event committee (CEC), according to prespecified definitions in the 
CEC charter.  
Primary endpoint (time to adjudicated CV death or HHF) 
The primary analysis was a Cox regression with factors treatment, region (Asia, Europe, Latin America, 
North America, and other), baseline diabetes status (diabetic, pre-diabetes, and normal), age 
(continuous), sex, baseline LVEF (≤ 30%, >30% to ≤35%, >35%), and baseline eGFR (CKD-EPI)cr 
(continuous). Region, diabetes history, and eGFR (CKD-EPI)cr (<60 or ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m²) at screening 
were randomisation stratification factors. Following the ITT principle, all data up to the end of the planned 
treatment period (including the data after the end of treatment for patients not completing the treatment 
period as planned) from all randomised patients were used. Patients without a specific endpoint event 
were considered censored at the last date, the patient was known to be free of the event or at the end of 
the planned treatment period, whichever was earlier. Cumulative incidence function curves that account 
for competing risks (i.e. non-CV deaths) and Kaplan-Meier curves of time to censoring were displayed. 
The individual components that contributed to the primary endpoint were summarized descriptively. 
Subgroup analyses by demographic and baseline characteristics (e.g. comorbidities, risk factors, and 
background HF medications) were carried out.

Key secondary endpoint 1 (adjudicated recurrent HHF) 
The primary analysis for recurrent HHF used a joint frailty model that accounts for the dependence 
between recurrent HHF and CV death, with the same covariates used for the primary endpoint. All data 
up to the end of the planned treatment period (including the data after the end of treatment for patients 
not completing the treatment period as planned) from all randomised patients were used. The number of 
HHF events per patient was summarized descriptively. Negative binomial models were additionally fitted 
for recurrent HHF events. The mean cumulative incidence was displayed for adjudicated recurrent HHF. 
Subgroup analyses were carried out. 
Key secondary endpoint 2 (eGFR slope of change from baseline) 
The primary analysis was a random coefficient model allowing for random intercept and random slope per 
patient, with the same factors used for the primary endpoint and additional factors “time”, “treatment-by-
time interaction”, and “baseline eGFR (CKD-EPI)cr-by-time interaction”. Only “on-treatment” data (i.e. 
measurements up to 1 day after the last intake of study medication) were used. Subgroup analyses were 
carried out. 
Other secondary and further endpoints (exploratory) 
Exploratory efficacy endpoints were analysed in the following way in general: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Time-to-event endpoints: similar to the primary analysis of the primary endpoint. Subgroup 
analyses were performed for time to CV death and time to first HHF 
Recurrent events endpoints: similar to the primary analysis of the first key secondary 
endpoint 
Continuous endpoints: a mixed model repeated measure (MMRM) analysis 
Categorical endpoints: descriptive

About half of the screened patients (48.3%) were not randomised, most commonly because of NT-proBNP 
levels being below protocol-specified thresholds at screening (36.1% of screened patients). Of the 3730 
randomised patients, 3688 patients (98.9%) had complete follow-up for the primary endpoint and the

final vital status was known for 3709 patients (99.4%); see Table 11 and Figure 24. Of the 3726 patients 
treated with study medication, 993 patients prematurely discontinued treatment (26.7%, including 
patients who died). The most common reason for premature discontinuation of study medication was an 
AE (8.7% of patients with non-fatal events and 9.5% with fatal events).

Figure 4 Patient Recruitment and Disposition 
Incomplete follow-up for the primary endpoint refers to incomplete information on either vital status or 
hospitalization until the planned end of the treatment period for those patients who had not experienced 
an adjudicated primary outcome. The 21 patients without known vital status at the end of the trial 
included 11 on empagliflozin and 10 on placebo. Three patients with missing vital status at the end of the 
trial experienced an adjudicated hospitalization for heart failure and are not considered to have an 
incomplete follow-up for the primary endpoint 
Baseline data 
Patients in this trial represented a population with chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction 
(mean LVEF 27.5%, SD 6.0) with a NYHA class of II (75.1%), III (24.4%), or IV (20 patients, 0.5%). The 
average age was 66.8 years (SD 11.0); 23.9% were women, 70.5% White, 18.0% Asian, and 6.9% 
Black/African American. About half of patients (49.8%) had T2DM, and about half (48.2%) had an eGFR 
of <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (of whom 205 patients, 5.5%, had an eGFR of <30) at baseline. At study 
baseline, 31.4% had a defibrillator (ICD or CRT-D), 11.8% had a CRT, 88.3% were treated with ACE 
inhibitors/ARBs/ARNi (19.5% ARNi), 94.7% with beta-blockers, and 95.0% with diuretics (71.3% MRAs). 
Details are provided below. 
Demographic characteristics 
About three quarters of the patients were men. The majority of the patients were White (70.5%) and 
elderly (62.1% of patients were ≥65 years old, including 26.8% of patients ≥75 years old). See Table 12 
for details.

Patients in this trial had an LVEF of ≤40%. Mean LVEF was 27.5%, and almost three-quarters of the 
patients had a value of ≤30%. Median NT-proBNP was 1910 pg/ml (Q1, Q3 1115, 3481). The majority of 
patients had SBP <140 mmHg and DBP <90 mmHg. eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 was reported for 48.2% 
of patients, with 198 patients (5.3%) in the range of 20 to <30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Normal UACR was 
reported for 55.7% of patients, while 33.1% of patients had microalbuminuria and 10.6% had 
macroalbuminuria. A history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter was reported for 38.6% of patients. Half of 
the patients were reported with type 2 diabetes, and none were reported with type 1 diabetes (Table 13).

Heart failure-related medical history 
Most patients were in NYHA class II or III. More than 40% of patients had been diagnosed with HF more 
than 5 years before the trial. The cause of HF was ischaemic for 51.7% of patients. A total of 31.4% of 
patients had a defibrillator, and 11.8% had a CRT device (Table 14)

Intensification of diuretic therapy after baseline was less frequent in the empagliflozin group vs placebo 
(16.0 vs 22.2% of patients), while a decrease of diuretic therapy was more frequent in the empagliflozin 
group vs placebo (15.1 vs 13.2%). 
Heart Failure Outcomes 
Primary outcome – CV death or HHF 
The primary endpoint was the time to the first event of adjudicated CV death or adjudicated 
hospitalisation for heart failure. The primary analysis was a Cox regression based on all data up to the 
end of the planned treatment period (including the data after the end of treatment for patients not 
completing the treatment period as planned) from all randomised patients. Patients without a specific

endpoint event were censored at the last date the patient was known to be event free or at the end of the 
planned treatment period, whichever was earlier.  
CV death or HHF occurred in a lower proportion of patients in the empagliflozin group (361 of 
1863 patients, 19.4%) than in the placebo group (462 of 1867 patients, 24.7%), and the risk of CV death 
or HHF was significantly reduced with empagliflozin treatment compared with placebo (HR empagliflozin 
vs. placebo 0.75; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.86, p<0.0001; Table 17). During the trial period, the number of 
patients who would need to have been treated with empagliflozin to prevent one primary event (NNT) 
was 19 (95% CI, 13 to 37). The treatment effect of empagliflozin became apparent shortly after 
randomisation and was maintained throughout the trial (Figure 5). The number of patients with a HHF or 
CV death during the 30 days after treatment discontinuation was the same in each treatment arm 
(122 patients, 6.9%).

In general, the results were consistent across the pre-defined subgroups by demographics, baseline 
characteristics (including T2DM status), and baseline HF medications, with the HR point estimate for all 
subgroups below (Figure 6). The subgroup analyses were not adjusted for multiple testing.

Key Secondary endpoint - first and recurrent HHF 
A lower proportion of patients in the empagliflozin group (246 patients, 13.2%) than in the placebo group 
(342 patients, 18.3%) had an adjudicated HHF event, and the total number of HHF events (first and 
recurrent) was also lower in the empagliflozin group (388) than in the placebo group (553). Treatment 
with empagliflozin reduced the risk of recurrent HHF by 30% compared with placebo (HR 0.70, 95.04% CI 
0.58 to 0.85, p = 0.0003, Table 18)

All pre-specified sensitivity analyses were consistent with the primary analysis for recurrent HHF. The 
subgroup analyses of recurrent HHF showed similar trends to those observed for the primary endpoint, 
with the point estimate for all subgroups below 1.  
Other HHF-related endpoints  
Exploratory HHF-related endpoints corroborated the treatment benefit of empagliflozin on reducing the 
risk of recurrent HHF (Figure 8)

2 Cox regression, time-to-event analysis  
The HHF results were supported by a higher win ratio for empagliflozin vs placebo (1.33, 95% CI 1.16, 
1.54) when accounting for clinical hierarchies, where CV death was considered more important than HHF. 
In line with the improvements in HF outcomes, there was a decrease in NT-proBNP levels in the 
empagliflozin group compared with placebo (adjusted gMean ratio of relative change to baseline at Week 
52 for empagliflozin vs placebo 0.87, 95% CI 0.82, 0.93). 
Mortality endpoints – secondary endpoint 
Fewer patients were reported with all-cause, CV, or non-CV mortality in the empagliflozin group than in 
the placebo group, but the treatment effects were not significant on a nominal level. The majority of the 
deaths were due to CV causes, and most of the CV deaths were classified as sudden cardiac death 
(empagliflozin: 70 patients, 3.8%; placebo: 81 patients, 4.3%) and heart failure death (empagliflozin: 64 
patients, 3.4%; placebo: 62 patients, 3.3%), as expected in a population with heart failure (Figure 9). 
Further details are described below.

Time to all-cause mortality  
The time to all-cause mortality was a secondary endpoint. Death from any cause occurred in 249 patients 
(13.4%) in the empagliflozin group and 266 patients (14.2%) in the placebo group (HR 0.92, 95% CI 
0.77 to 1.10, nominal p = 0.3536). The majority of the deaths were due to CV causes (Table 19). The 
Kaplan-Meier estimate of time to all-cause mortality is displayed in Figure 10.

Time to CV death  
The time to adjudicated CV death was an exploratory secondary endpoint. Adjudicated CV death occurred 
in 187 patients (10.0%) in the empagliflozin group and 202 patients (10.8%) in the placebo group (HR 
0.92, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.12, nominal p = 0.4133: Table 19 above). The cumulative incidence of 
adjudicated CV death is displayed in Figure 11.

The CEC categorised the causes of all CV deaths, with the most common categories being sudden cardiac 
death and heart failure death (Table 20). Fewer patients were reported with CEC-defined sudden cardiac 
death in the empagliflozin group (70 patients, 3.8%) than in the placebo group (81 patients, 4.3%).

In general, the results for adjudicated CV death were consistent across the subgroups by demographics, 
baseline characteristics, and baseline HF medications. 
Hospitalisation endpoint – secondary endpoint 
Treatment with empagliflozin reduced the risk of all-cause hospitalisations, including for recurrent events 
and when analysed together with all-cause mortality. The treatment effect of empagliflozin also became 
Extension of indication variation assessment report

apparent shortly after randomisation and was maintained throughout the trial. First all-cause 
hospitalisation was reduced with empagliflozin treatment (688 patients, 36.9% vs placebo 796 patients, 
42.6%; HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.95). This finding seems mainly driven by hospitalisation of 
investigator defined CV hospitalisation (empagliflozin 452 patients, 24.3% vs placebo 570 patients, 
30.5%; HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.85).

Renal Outcomes 
Key Secondary endpoint - eGFR slope of change from baseline 
The analysis of eGFR (CKD-EPI)cr slope of change from baseline showed a significantly slower decline in 
eGFR in the empagliflozin group, with an estimated difference in slope of 1.733 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year 
vs placebo (99.9% CI 0.669, 2.796; p<0.0001, Table 21). The calculation of the eGFR slope of change 
from baseline included all on-treatment data from the first to the last value on-treatment. This represents 
the 'chronic' slope which was defined due to the previously observed initial drop in eGFR with 
empagliflozin. The first scheduled on-treatment visit was on Day 28 (± 7 days).  
Consistent results were observed across subgroups, including patients with or without T2DM and patients 
with different categories of baseline eGFR.

A histogram of the individual patient slopes showed a uniform shift in the empagliflozin group to slower 
eGFR decline compared with the placebo group, supporting that the effect of empagliflozin vs placebo 
treatment was observed across the population (Figure 13).

Further eGFR analyses – secondary endpoint  
An exploratory Mixed model repeated measure (MMRM) analysis of eGFR change from baseline including 
also off-treatment values showed a similar trend of slowing of eGFR decline over time, consistent with the 
results of the slope analysis. In the empagliflozin group, there was an initial drop in eGFR at Week 4 
which partially recovered at Week 12. Thereafter, a slower decrease in the empagliflozin group compared 
with placebo was observed (Figure 14)

In an analysis of patients with valid baseline, last-value-on-treatment, and follow-up values, eGFR 
returned towards the baseline level in the empagliflozin group at the follow-up visit, about 30 days after 
treatment stop, while the decrease in eGFR in the placebo group persisted (Table 22).

Further renal outcomes – secondary and exploratory endpoint 
Empagliflozin treatment reduced the risk of the composite renal endpoint (chronic dialysis, renal 
transplant, or sustained reduction in eGFR) by 50%. For most patients the first recorded renal event was 
sustained reduction in eGFR from baseline of ≥40% (Table 23). The treatment effect of empagliflozin 
started about 200 days after randomisation and was maintained throughout the trial ( Figure 15)

In this trial, 396 patients (10.6%) had macroalbuminuria (UACR >300 mg/g), 1236 patients (33.1%) had 
microalbuminuria (30 to ≤300 mg/g), and 2078 patients (55.7%) had normoalbuminuria (<30 mg/g) at 
baseline. There was a trend towards an improvement in the empagliflozin group versus placebo in the 
progression to or reversal of macroalbuminuria. Fewer patients in the empagliflozin group (116 of 1646 
patients, 7.0%) than in the placebo group (143 of 1668 patients, 8.6%; HR 0.81, 95% CI 0.64, to 1.04) 
progressed to macroalbuminuria from normo- or microalbuminuria at baseline. More patients in the 
empagliflozin group reversed from macroalbuminuria to sustained normo- or microalbuminuria

(empagliflozin: 99 of 207 patients, 47.8%; placebo: 85 of 189 patients, 45.0%; HR 1.24, 95% CI 0.92 to 
1.67)  
Patient reported outcomes 
Patient reported outcomes measured by KCCQ at Week 52 – secondary endpoint 
The KCCQ comprises 7 domains and 3 summary scores as shown in Figure 16. Each patient was also 
asked to identify the domain that was the most difficult to cope with at baseline (patient-preferred 
outcome). The scores of the KCCQ domains and summary scores range from 0 to 100, with higher score 
indicating better outcome. 
Figure 16 KCCQ individual domains and summary scores 
Treatment with empagliflozin improved the KCCQ clinical summary score (an exploratory secondary 
endpoint) from baseline to Week 52 compared with placebo (placebo-corrected adjusted mean change 
from baseline 1.75, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.99; Figure 17). The score was higher at the first post-baseline 
assessment (Week 12) in the empagliflozin group than the placebo group, and the difference was 
sustained up to the last assessment (Week 52; Figure 18 green box). 
A higher proportion of patients in the empagliflozin group (576 patients, 40.0%) than in the placebo 
group (512 patients, 35.9%; odds ratio 1.233, 95% CI 1.051 to 1.448) showed a clinically meaningful 
improvement in KCCQ clinical summary score at Week 52 of at least 5 points from baseline. Consistently, 
a lower proportion of patients in the empagliflozin group (473 patients, 32.8%) than in the placebo group 
(515 patients, 36.1%; odds ratio 0.844, 95% CI 0.722 to 0.987) showed clinically meaningful 
deterioration of at least 5 points from baseline.  
The favourable effect of empagliflozin vs placebo was driven by all domains included in the KCCQ clinical 
summary score (symptom frequency, symptom burden, and physical limitations). Supportive analyses of 
other KCCQ summary scores (overall summary score and total symptoms score) were in line with these 
results (Figure 17 and Figure 18). 
In this trial, each patient was asked to identify the domain that was the most difficult to cope with at 
baseline. The most common domain the patients identified was total symptom (i.e. symptom frequency 
and burden; 32% of patients) and physical limitation (21% of patients), illustrating that the use of clinical 
summary score was the most relevant from the patients’ perspective. 
The improvement in HF symptoms was in line with the HF clinical outcome results and also consistent 
with the observed improvements in NYHA class with empagliflozin treatment. More patients in the 
empagliflozin group (360 patients, 26.8%) than in the placebo group (303 patients, 22.8%) improved in 
NYHA class from baseline to Week 52, and fewer patients in the empagliflozin group (48 patients, 3.6%) 
than in the placebo group (75 patients, 5.6%) worsened.

The onset of DM in patients with pre-DM occurred in fewer patients in the empagliflozin group (71 of 632 
patients, 11.2%) than in the placebo group (80 of 636 patients, 12.6%; HR 0.86, 95% CI 0.62 to 1.19). 
A sustained reduction in HbA1c of about 0.2% was only seen in the empagliflozin group compared with 
placebo in patients with T2DM at baseline. No relevant changes in fasting glucose were seen in either 
treatment group.

EMPERIAL Reduced/Preserved (1245.168 and 1245.167) 
Methods 
Study participants  
The eligibility criteria in the EMPERIAL trials were generally similar to those in the EMPEROR trials, with 
the exception that the thresholds for NT-proBNP were higher in EMPEROR-reduced, and that the 
EMPERIAL trials had the addition of criteria ensuring that patients could carry out the 6-minute walk test 
(6MWT) and a potential increase in the distance after 12 weeks could be detected (6MWT distance should 
be between 100 m and 350 m at baseline). 
Treatments  
The additional EMPERIAL trials were comparable to regarding the screening and treatment, except for the 
treatment duration. The EMPERIAL trials were not event-driven but were designed to investigate the 
short-term (12 weeks) effect of empagliflozin on functional capacity, signs and symptoms of heart failure, 
and quality of life. Therefore, a treatment duration of 12 weeks was implemented (see Figure 19).

Objectives  
The aim of the EMPERIAL-reduced/preserved trials is to evaluate the effect of empagliflozin 10 mg versus 
placebo on exercise ability using the 6-minute walking test (6MWT) in patients with HFrEF or HFpEF. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The following endpoints were pre-specified for both 1245.168 and 1245.167: 
Primary endpoint: change from baseline to Week 12 in the 6-minute-walk test (6MWT) distance 
• 
•  Key secondary endpoints: 
•  Change from baseline to Week 12 in KCCQ-TSS (, total symptom score) 
•  Change from baseline to Week 12 in CHQ-SAS (chronic heart failure questionnaire self-
administered standardised format) dyspnoea score 
•  Other secondary endpoints: 
•  Change from baseline to Week 6 in the 6MWT distance 
•  Change from baseline to Week 12 in Clinical Congestion Score 
•  Change from baseline to Week 12 in PGI-S (patient global impression of severity) of HF 
symptoms 
PGI-C (patient global impression of change) in HF symptoms at Week 12 
•  Change from baseline to Week 12 in PGI-S of dyspnoea 
• 
• 
•  Change from baseline in NT-proBNP at Week 12 
PGI-C in dyspnoea at Week 12 
Further endpoints included responders in 6MWT distance, clinician- and patient-reported outcomes, 
changes in NYHA class, the occurrence of clinical events, and changes in blood pressure and body weight. 
Sample size  
The EMPERIAL-reduced and -preserved trial (1245.168 and 1245.167) included 312 and 315 subjects, 
respectively.  
Statistical methods  
For confirmatory testing of efficacy, a hierarchical procedure was applied to test the primary and key 
secondary endpoints.

The main efficacy analyses followed the intent-to-treat (ITT) principle and included all randomised 
patients and all available values, including those obtained off-treatment. The primary analysis of the 
primary and both key secondary endpoints used a normal approximation of the Wilcoxon rank test. In 
order to rank the missing values at Week 12, imputation rules for the missing values according to the 
nature for missing were prespecified (worst-case imputation, WCI). The ranking for the imputed values 
was according to the following order, from the highest rank to the lowest. The ranking rules followed 
recommendations from the FDA. 
Ranking for patients with missing values at Week 12: 
•  Without clinical event (defined as SAEs or AEs leading to treatment discontinuation ongoing at 
Week 12, excluding deaths) 
o  And with a post-baseline value (e.g. at Week 6): rank below the worst possible value that can 
be measured and by the available value (the higher the distance walked, the higher the rank) 
o  And without post-baseline value: rank below the patients described in the previous point 
•  With clinical event1: rank below the patients described in the previous point, regardless of any post-
• 
baseline value 
The patient died before Week 12: rank below the patients described in the previous point and by the 
days from randomisation to death (the later the death, the higher the rank) 
For estimation of the difference between treatments, the non-parametric Hodges-Lehmann estimate for 
the median difference was calculated with imputation of missing values.  
The analyses and imputation rules for both key secondary endpoints were similar to those for the primary 
endpoint. 
• 
Other exploratory efficacy endpoints were analysed generally as follows: 
• 
The change from baseline to Week 6 in the 6MWT distance: similar analyses as for the primary 
endpoint 
Ordinal endpoints (e.g. change in score category): Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test on the 
difference in mean treatment scores, based on modified ridit scores; shifts between categories 
were tabulated descriptively 
Continuous endpoints (e.g. change in score value): MMRM analyses 
Responder endpoints: a chi-square test to compare response between treatment groups 
Other binary endpoints (e.g. occurrence of clinical events): descriptive 
• 
• 
• 
Responder thresholds for KCCQ-TSS and CHQ-SAS dyspnoea score were based on clinically meaningful 
within-patient changes in scores, using an anchor-based method and derived specifically from the trial 
population. The anchors and the definitions for minimal clinically meaningful improvement were 
prespecified and agreed with the FDA. 
Results 
Baseline characteristics 
Patients with chronic HF were screened and, if eligible, randomised according to the EF value to either 
trial 1245.168 (HFrEF) or 1245.167 (HFpEF). Almost all randomised patients in the two trials were from 
Europe and North America (Table 25).

In 1245.168, a total of 312 patients were randomised, and 311 were treated with study medication. Of 
the 311 treated patients, 298 patients (95.8%) completed the trial and 283 patients (91.0%) completed 
the treatment with study medication. The completion was similar in both treatment groups. The most 
frequent reason for premature discontinuation of study medication was an AE (6.1%). The mean 
exposure of the patients was similar in both treatment groups (empagliflozin: 11.84 [SD 1.64] weeks; 
placebo: 11.80 [SD 1.84] weeks)  
In 1245.167, of the 315 randomised patients treated with study medication, 301 (95.6%) completed the 
trial, and 291 (92.4%) completed the treatment with study medication. There were no relevant 
differences between the treatment groups. The most frequent reason for premature discontinuation of 
study medication was an AE (5.4%). The mean exposure of patients was similar in both treatment groups 
(empagliflozin: 11.71 weeks [SD 2.32]; placebo: 11.89 weeks [SD 2.12])  
The main patient characteristics in both trials are shown in Table 26 below. The MAH states that the 
characteristics were generally balanced between the treatment groups within each trial. Between 
1245.168 (HFrEF) and 1245.167 (HFpEF), the following differences in the patient populations were noted: 
Both trials together included patients encompassing the entire range of EF values, with patients having 
reduced LVEF (≤40%) in 1245.168 and preserved LVEF in 1245.167 (>40%)

endpoints (change from baseline to Week 12 in KCCQ-TSS and in CHQ-SAS dyspnoea score) were 
therefore tested in an exploratory fashion. 
In 1245.168 (HFrEF), treatment with empagliflozin numerically improved the KCCQ-TSS from baseline to 
Week 12 compared with placebo; the treatment difference was observed in the Hodges-Lehmann 
estimate (median difference 3.13, 95% CI 0.00, 7.29) and using MMRM (mean difference 4.55, 95% CI 
1.18, 7.93). Supportive analyses of other KCCQ summary scores (overall summary score and clinical 
summary score) were in line with these results. The favourable effect of empagliflozin vs placebo was 
driven predominantly by numerical improvements in the KCCQ domains symptom frequency, symptom 
burden, and social limitation. 
The findings of 1245.168, specifically the neutral results for 6MWT distance and the numerical 
improvements in KCCQ, are consistent with the findings from trials investigating the SGLT-2 inhibitor 
dapagliflozin in patients with HFrEF. A systematic review of clinical trials testing drugs currently approved 
for the treatment of patients with HFrEF demonstrated low correlation or interdependence between 6MWT 
results and CV mortality or HHF.  
The KCCQ results in 1245.168 were qualitatively consistent with those in 1245.121, which had a much 
longer follow up and showed that the favourable effect of empagliflozin treatment was sustained up to the 
last planned assessment (Week 52).  
No meaningful differences between treatment groups were observed in the efficacy endpoints in 
1245.167 (HFpEF). 
3.3.9.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The EMPEROR-reduced trial (1245.121) Phase III program for empagliflozin 10 mg once daily was a 
double-blind, randomised, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multi-national trial in patients with HFrEF 
with or without T2DM. The trial consisted of an event-driven study duration (resulting in a median follow 
up of 16 months of treatment) and followed by a 30-days period off study-drug. The (combined) primary 
outcome was the time to the first event of adjudicated CV death or adjudicated HHF. The design of the 
trial is in line with the EMA guideline “Clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment of 
chronic heart failure” (CPMP/EWP/235/95, Rev.2). The MAH has provided a statement that the trials are 
carried out in compliance with the CTP, with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, with the ICH 
GCP, and with applicable regulatory requirements and BI’s standard operating procedures. 
The inclusion criteria in the EMPEROR-reduced trial included a cut-off value of NT proBNP that was 
defined depending on EF. About half of the screened patients (48.3%) were not randomised, most 
commonly because of NT-proBNP levels being below protocol-specified thresholds at screening (36.1% of 
screened patients). It, therefore, raises the question if the selection of patients represents the general 
population of patients with HFrEF and if the observed results are also applicable on the HFrEF patients 
that do not fully meet this inclusion criterium, as can often be the case in clinical practice. The MAH 
provided an analysis showing that the effect was similar between the NT-proBNP subgroups and that in 
other studies (EMPA-REG, DAPA-HF), the benefits on CV outcomes were similar although the NT-proBNP 
levels were lower. This suggests that the effect is not dependent on NT-proBNP levels. It is not shown 
that the population in the EMPEROR-Reduced trial is representative for the general population, but it is 
considered plausible that the findings could be extrapolated to the patients who were excluded from the 
study based on lower NT-proBNP values. 
Although the list of exclusion criteria seems extensive, the described exclusion criteria are reasonable and 
do not seem to further hamper the translation of the trial results to the general population with HFrEF in 
clinical practice.

EMA/CHMP/275072/2021 
Page 60/96 
 
 
  
  
 
The statistical analyses in the trial design are based on an intention to treat analysis and the primary 
analysis was a Cox regression. This is acceptable. The analysis of eGFR decline uses a model with random 
intercept and slope. The estimated slope should be seen in conjunction with the intercept, as the initial 
dip will (in part) be estimated by the intercept. To confirm that the primary analysis of eGFR slope did not 
hide a potentially deleterious effect by ignoring the initial dip, the MAH performed an additional ANCOVA 
analysis.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the EMPEROR-reduced trial, about half of the screened patients (48.3%) were not randomised, most 
commonly because of NT-proBNP levels being below protocol-specified thresholds at screening (36.1% of 
screened patients). This raised the question if the selection of patients represents the general population 
of patients with HFrEF, and if the observed results are also applicable on the HFrEF patients that do not 
fully meet this inclusion criterium. As mentioned above, it is considered plausible that the findings could 
be extrapolated to the patients that were excluded from the study based on lower NT-proBNP values. No 
difference was observed in premature discontinuation rates between the empagliflozin group and placebo. 
In general, demographics were well balanced between the treatment groups in the EMPEROR-reduced 
trial. The majority of subjects were elderly, white male subjects, which is in line with the prevalence of 
HFrEF in the general population. However, there is a small difference in the percentage of subjects with a 
SBP < 140 mmHg, i.e. 82.4% in the placebo group and 78.9 empagliflozin group, and for subjects with a 
BMI > 30 kg/m2, i.e. 30.4% in the placebo group and 32.2% in the empagliflozin group. The higher 
percentage of subjects with a lower SBP (i.e. < 140 mmHg) in the placebo group is not likely to alter the 
interpretation of the results in the empagliflozin group and is therefore not a large concern in this study.  
The use of concomitant therapies was as expected and in line with the treatment guidelines for HF and 
was at baseline equally distributed between the treatment groups, but intensification of diuretic therapy 
after baseline was less frequent in the empagliflozin group vs placebo (16.0 vs 22.2% of patients). 
The primary endpoint of CV death or HHF occurred in a lower proportion of patients in the empagliflozin 
group than in the placebo group (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.86, p<0.0001). This effect is regardless of 
diabetes status. However, the reduction in events of CV death or HHF with empagliflozin was less 
pronounced in the white population. This is remarkable because this is the largest group and represents 
the largest group of patients with HFrEF. To explain the finding of white race as a modifier, the MAH 
evaluated baseline characteristics and therapies by race. There were small differences, i.e. White patients 
were older (mean (SD), White 68.0 (10.5), Black/African American 62.1 (11.5), Asian 64.7 (12.0) year), 
had a higher rate of atrial fibrillation or flutter and of COPD, as well as lower mean eGFR, but the 
differences were modest. This may partly contribute to the differences in observed effect between races, 
but it is still not elucidated why the effect on CV death or HHF is less pronounced in White patients. 
However, as it is considered also beneficial in this population, this is not a major issue. 
In subjects with a LVEF > 30% the HR estimate for reduction in events of CV death or HHF was close to 
1. The MAH performed additional analyses, dividing the patients in different LVEF subgroups (≤ 30%, 31-
35% and 36-40%), and compared baseline characteristics and the use of other medication for the 
treatment of heart failure between the subgroup of LVEF. Only the subgroup LVEF 31-35% had a HR 
above 1 (HR 1.1, 95% CI 0.79-1.53). Small differences were described on baseline characteristics or use 
of medication but are considered unlikely to explain the finding of decreased effect of empagliflozin in 
patients with LVEF 31-35%. A pathophysiological reason is not very likely to explain this finding and it 
could therefore be explained by chance. Comparing the findings on the primary outcome with the DAPA-
HF study, the primary outcome was observed in the current EMPEROR study more frequently (i.e. in 
DAPA-HF dapagliflozin 16.3% vs placebo 21.2%, in EMPEROR empagliflozin 19.4% vs placebo 24.7%). 
This finding cannot be fully explained by a larger percentage of patients with severe HF in the EMPEROR 
trial, as the distribution of NYHA classification between the studies was quite comparable (DAPA-HF NYHA 
II 67%, III 32%, IV 1%, vs EMPEROR NYHA II 75%, III 24%, IV 1%) and the mean LVEF did not differ 
largely (mean LVEF in DAPA-HF 31%, in EMPEROR 27%).

EMA/CHMP/275072/2021

No meaningful difference in events was observed on all-cause mortality, especially not on CV-death (HR 
0.92 (95% CI, 0.75 to 1.12). This may indicate that the results in primary endpoint are mainly driven by 
HHF related outcomes, but not a reduction in CV death. It is plausible that this may in part explain this 
finding. A meta-analysis was performed of both trials and a test for heterogeneity of effect size between 
the trials was performed. This did not result in heterogeneity between dapagliflozin and empagliflozin 
overall or within subgroup category. In addition, HHF related outcome is a less hard clinical endpoint and 
this endpoint could be influenced by the clinical practice in different centres. As the number of events in 
each centre was limited, a subgroup analysis was considered not feasible. Adjudication of potential events 
was performed by an independent and blinded CEC to ensure that a uniform definition was applied to 
confirm an HHF event, irrespective of from which centre the event was reported. The evaluation of HF 
outcomes across the spectrum of clinical thresholds resulted in consistent findings. This supports that the 
EMPEROR-Reduced HHF result is not sensitive to what precise clinical criteria are applied. Although it is 
acknowledged by the MAH that the clinical decision to hospitalise a patient might be influenced by many 
factors, the performed evaluation does not show a difference between centers. It has to be taken into 
account that the event rate of CV deaths is lower compared to HHF related events, but a claim of lower 
reduction of CV death cannot be made based on these results.  
The change of eGFR slope from baseline was a secondary endpoint and showed a slower decline in eGFR 
in the empagliflozin group, with an estimated difference in slope of 1.733 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year vs 
placebo (99.9% CI 0.669, 2.796; p<0.0001). However, in the same analysis, the intercept was lower for 
the empagliflozin group, likely caused by the initial dip. The effect on the slope can only be interpreted if 
seen in conjunction with intercept. To confirm that the primary analysis of eGFR slope did not hide a 
potentially deleterious effect by ignoring the initial dip, the MAH performed an additional ANCOVA 
analysis. This analysis weighed the observations by the squared time to follow up for each patient, which 
is acceptable since the longer the follow up time the better the slope can be differentiated from the initial 
dip. The results confirmed the primary analysis (1.74 vs 1.73). The MAH also adapted section 5.1 of the 
SmPC by adding the intercept of the primary analysis model as requested. The slope data support the 
effect on the renal composite endpoint, which would be actually preferred, i.e. a beneficial effect on the 
exploratory renal composite endpoint of (i.e. chronic dialysis, renal transplant, or sustained reduction in 
eGFR), HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.32 - 0.77, p=0.0019), which suggests that the observation may still be 
beneficial on the long term. This was mainly driven by the GFR >40% reduction endpoint, and the 
number of composite endpoints was limited (30/1863 in the empagliflozin group and 58/1867 in the 
placebo group, HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.32 - 0.77). 
The KCCQ was used to measure patient-reported outcomes. KCCQ consists of several domains and 
summary scores. Treatment with empagliflozin improved the KCCQ clinical summary score from baseline 
to Week 52 compared with placebo (mean change from baseline 1.75, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.99). The MAH 
justifies the choice for the KCCQ clinical summary score as most relevant to the patient. However, in this 
trial, each patient was asked to identify the domain that was the most difficult to cope with from the 
patients’ perspective at baseline and the most common domain the patients identified was total symptom 
(i.e. symptom frequency and burden; 32% of patients) and physical limitation (21% of patients). Patients 
preferred KCCQ outcome did not differ between treatment groups. But the ‘patient preferred outcome’ 
has limitations, as this was only asked once at baseline and no time-dependency was assessed, in 
contrast to the standard KCCQ. The validated scores of the KCCQ are therefore considered more reliable 
to evaluate the patient related outcomes. 
EMPERIAL trials 
The MAH describes that the demographic and baseline characteristics of the individual EMPERIAL trials 
(1245.168 (HFrEF) or 1245.167 (HFpEF)) were similar between the treatment groups and similar to the 
EMPEROR trial. Comparing the baseline characteristics between the two EMPERIAL trials, the subjects in 
the EMPERIAL HFpEF trial were more often women, older, and had a lower NT proBNP, a higher SBP and 
had more often atrial fibrillation compared with the subjects in the EMPERIAL HFrEF trial. This may 
support the difference in population between patients with HFrEF versus HFpEF. In both trials, the 
primary endpoint (change from baseline to Week 12 in the 6MWT distance) did not show a statistically

significant difference between empagliflozin and placebo. This, therefore, does not support a beneficial 
effect of empagliflozin on HF related symptoms. 
3.3.10.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The finding from EMPEROR-reduced trial of reduced occurrence of HHF or CV death is an important 
benefit. It is, however, important to point out that this finding seems mainly due to the effect on HHF, as 
no relevant reduction in CV death was observed butthe study was not powered and designed to assess CV 
death as independent endpoint. With the current indication, the beneficial effect on HFF or CV death 
results in a positive benefit-risk ratio, especially as no new major safety issues have been observed.  
The findings on change eGFR slope and renal outcomes are supportive and promising and are addressed 
in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
3.4.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Safety analyses followed the “treatment-emergent” principle and included all treated patients (Treated 
Set, TS). Unless otherwise specified, treatment was assigned as randomised and the analyses of AEs 
were based on the number of patients with AEs. AE analyses were restricted to “on-treatment” AEs, 
defined as AEs with an onset date between the first trial medication intake and 7 days after the last 
intake, unless otherwise stated. Exposure-adjusted AEs were also displayed as incidence rates per 100 
patient-years.  
As trial 1245.121 (EMPEROR-Reduced) represented most of the exposure in the completed trials in 
patients with chronic HF, the evaluation of the safety results in this document focuses on the data from 
1245.121. Between 1245.168 (HFrEF) and 1245.167 (HFpEF), no relevant differences in the safety results 
were observed. 
Overall, treatment with empagliflozin 10 mg in patients with HFrEF revealed no new safety findings 
compared with the known safety profile of empagliflozin in patients with T2DM. The safety profile for 
patients with HFrEF and without T2DM was similar to those with T2DM. Detailed information is provided 
below.  
Patient exposure  
In 1245.121, 3730 patients with HFrEF were randomised. The majority of included patients were from 
Europe and Latin America. In SAF-HF2, 311 patients with HFrEF were treated in 1245.168 and 315 
patients with HFpEF in 1245.167. Almost all patients were from Europe or North America (Table 27)

Of the 3730 randomised patients in 1245.121, 3688 patients (98.9%) had complete follow-up for the 
primary endpoint and the final vital status was known for 3709 patients (99.4%). Of the 3726 patients 
treated with study medication, 993 patients prematurely discontinued treatment (26.7%, including 
patients who died). The most common reason for premature discontinuation of study medication was an 
AE (8.7% of patients with non-fatal events and 9.5% with fatal events). 
In 1245.121, the median exposure to study medication was about 14 months in both treatment groups, 
with 61% of patients treated for at least 1 year (Table 28).

In SAF-HF2, 91.7% of treated patients completed 12 weeks of treatment. The most frequent reason for 
premature discontinuation of treatment was an adverse event (5.8%). There were no relevant differences 
between treatment groups. The mean exposure was about 12 weeks in both treatment groups. 
Adverse events 
In 1245.121, empagliflozin and placebo groups had similar overall frequencies of patients with at least 
one reported AE (Table 29). Adverse events reported during this trial were primarily of mild or moderate 
intensity. Proportions of patients were also similar between groups for severe AEs and AEs, leading to 
premature study medication discontinuation. The frequency of investigator defined drug-related AEs was 
higher in the empagliflozin group than the placebo group. Serious AEs were less commonly reported for 
the empagliflozin group than for the placebo group; this was driven by a smaller proportion of the 
empagliflozin group reporting SAEs that required or prolonged hospitalisation compared with the placebo 
group. The frequency of fatal AEs was the same in both groups during the on-treatment period. 
In SAF-HF2, all categories of AEs were reported at similar or lower frequencies in the empagliflozin group 
than in the placebo group (Table 30)

In 1245.121, the most frequent AEs were expected from a patient population with HFrEF. AEs were most 
frequently reported in the system organ class (SOC) cardiac disorders (empagliflozin 571 patients, 30.6% 
vs placebo 697 patients, 37.4%), infections and infestations (510 patients, 27.4% vs 542 patients, 
29.1%), and metabolism and nutrition disorders (411 patients, 22.1% vs 476 patients, 25.6%). The most 
frequently reported PTs were cardiac failure (332 patients, 17.8% vs 444 patients, 23.8%), hypotension 
(130 patients, 7.0% vs 119 patients, 6.4%), and hyperkalaemia (101 patients, 5.4% vs 115 patients, 
6.2%). Adverse events with preferred terms PTs reported in ≥5% of patients in either group are

Investigator-defined drug-related AEs generally matched the adverse reactions in the product 
information. The most frequent events were reported in the SOC renal and urinary disorders 
(empagliflozin 69 patients, 3.7% vs placebo 48 patients, 2.6%), metabolism and nutrition disorders (57 
patients, 3.1% vs 43 patients, 2.3%), and infections and infestations (54 patients, 2.9% vs 43 patients, 
2.3%). The most frequent PTs were hypotension (43 patients, 2.3% vs 34 patients, 1.8%), urinary tract 
infection (27 patients, 1.4% vs 26 patients, 1.4%), and renal impairment (27 patients, 1.4% vs 20 
patients, 1.1%)  
In SAF-HF2 the frequency of patients with any AE was comparable between treatment groups (49.0% for 
empagliflozin vs 53.2% for placebo). At PT level, the most reported AE was cardiac failure, reported less 
frequently for patients in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group. For further details, see

AESIs and specific AEs 
AESIs (adverse events of special interest) and specific AEs that represent medical concepts were 
analysed. To capture all events related to a specific medical concept, a combination of investigator-
defined events, applicable CEC-adjudication results, standardised MedDRA query (SMQ), BI-customised 
MedDRA query (BIcMQ; when no SMQ was available), and/or additional definitions were used to analyse 
AESIs and specific AEs. The MedDRA queries or additional definitions used for the AESIs and specific AEs 
are consistent for all trials and the pooled analyses. 
The results of the AESIs and specific AEs were consistent with the known safety profile of empagliflozin in 
patients with T2DM (Table 34)

In SAF-HF2, the number of patients with any type of AESI or specific AE were low and the pattern was 
qualitatively similar to that in 1245.121. 
Decreased renal function  
The frequencies of acute renal failure (narrow SMQ) were similar in the empagliflozin and placebo groups 
(Table 35) Serious events were reported with a lower frequency for the empagliflozin group than placebo. 
Similar frequencies in both groups were observed for the events leading to treatment discontinuation.

Fewer patients were reported with serum creatinine ≥2x the baseline value and above the normal range 
in the empagliflozin group (22 patients, 1.2%) than in the placebo group (35 patients, 1.9%).

Similar frequencies in both treatment groups were observed for hepatic injury (narrow SMQs), for events 
reported as SAEs, or for those leading to treatment discontinuation (Table 36). Hepatic events 
adjudicated by the independent CEC as possibly related to study medication were reported for 6 patients 
(0.3%) in the empagliflozin group and 4 patients (0.2%) in the placebo group. The hepatic injury of 1 
patient in the empagliflozin group was adjudicated as probably related to study medication. The patient 
took concomitantly atorvastatin which is known to negatively impact liver function and which was 
discontinued about 1 week after the hepatic injury. No relevant differences in the liver function laboratory 
parameters or elevated transaminase values were observed between the 2 treatment groups.

Ketoacidosis  
For a comprehensive analysis in 1245.121, ketoacidosis was investigated using both broad and narrow 
BI-customised MedDRA query (BIcMQ). Based on the broad BIcMQ, events suggestive of ketoacidosis 
were reported for 11 patients (0.6%) in the empagliflozin group and for 18 patients (1.0%) in the placebo 
group (Table 37). Metabolic acidosis was the most frequent PT of the broad BIcMQ; there was no relevant 
increase in frequency for the empagliflozin group. All events in the broad BIcMQ were adjudicated, and 
none of the events was confirmed as certain ketoacidosis. One patient in the placebo group was 
adjudicated with potential ketoacidosis (mild intensity). No ketoacidosis was identified based on the 
narrow BIcMQ.

In 1245.121, more patients in the empagliflozin group (174 patients, 11.0%) than the placebo group 
(113 patients, 7.1%) had bicarbonate values that shifted from normal at baseline to below normal at last 
value on treatment. The frequency of patients with Potentially Clinically Significant Abnormalities (PCSA) 
of low bicarbonate values (<18 mmol/L) was greater in the empagliflozin group (273 patients, 16.1%) 
than the placebo group (197 patients, 11.6%). No noteworthy changes were observed in mean (SD) 
bicarbonate values from baseline to last value on treatment in either group: empagliflozin group -0.25 
(2.18) mEq/L; placebo group 0.01 (2.09) mEq/L. 
No ketoacidosis was reported in SAF-HF2. No clinically relevant differences between treatment groups in 
bicarbonate or urine ketone was observed 
AEs leading to lower limb amputation (LLA)  
Adverse events leading to LLA on treatment or up to trial completion were infrequent and comparable in 
the empagliflozin and placebo groups (Table 34) 
Urinary tract infection  
In 1245.121, the frequencies for urinary tract infection (narrow sub BIcMQ) were similar in both 
treatment groups (table 38). The most frequently reported PT was urinary tract infection, which was also 
reported with similar frequencies in both treatment groups. Other PTs were reported with similar

frequencies in both treatment groups except for cystitis, which was reported with numerically higher 
frequencies in the empagliflozin group (13 patients, 0.7%) than in the placebo group (6 patients, 0.3%). 
The frequencies for complicated urinary tract infections and the PTs included in this BIcMQ were similar in 
the empagliflozin group and the placebo group.

Subgroup analyses were performed by age, sex, race, and baseline eGFR, T2DM, and history of chronic or 
recurrent urinary tract infection. The results of the subgroup analyses were generally similar to the main 
analyses.  
Investigator-defined urinary tract infection (including urosepsis and acute pyelonephritis) were reported 
for 92 patients (4.9%) in the empagliflozin group and 83 patients (4.5%) in the placebo group. Urinary 
tract infections were mostly infections of the lower urinary tract (bladder and below) or asymptomatic 
bacteriuria. Most patients with urinary tract infection in both treatment groups had a single episode rather 
than multiple episodes of urinary tract infection.  
Similar frequencies in both treatment groups were observed for the analysis including the PT urosepsis 
and pyelonephritis based on the narrow sub BIcMQ (empagliflozin: 5 patients, 0.3%; placebo: 4 patients, 
0.2%). In this analysis, 4 patients (0.2%) on empagliflozin and none on placebo had urosepsis. Acute 
pyelonephritis was documented for none of the patients on empagliflozin but for 2 patients (0.1%) on 
placebo. In 1245.121, investigator-defined sepsis with the source urinary tract infection occurred in few 
patients (empagliflozin: 5 patients, 0.3%; placebo: 1 patient, 0.1%) Four of the 5 patients in the 
empagliflozin group were reported with the PT urosepsis. The 5 patients on empagliflozin with sepsis 
(source UTI) were female, whereas 1 patient on placebo was male (table 39).

In SAF-HF2, 11 patients (3.5%) in the empagliflozin group and 8 patients (2.5%) in the placebo group 
were reported with urinary tract infection. Investigator-defined urinary tract infection was reported for the 
same patients as those captured using BIcMQ.  
Genital infection  
Genital infections (narrow BIcMQ) were more frequent in the empagliflozin group than the placebo group 
(Table 40). Genital infections occurred in male and female patients, and in patients with and without 
T2DM (Table 41). No relevant difference between treatment groups was observed in the frequency of 
complicated genital infections or those leading to treatment discontinuation.

Volume depletion and hypotension  
There was a numerical increase in the narrow BIcMQ volume depletion (empagliflozin: 197 patients, 
10.6%; placebo: 184 patients, 9.9%) and in the BIcMQ hypotension (empagliflozin: 176 patients, 9.4%; 
placebo: 163 patients, 8.7%) for the empagliflozin group when compared with placebo (Table 42). The 
small increases were not considered clinically relevant, as the frequencies of investigator-defined 
symptomatic hypotension events, which represent clinically relevant hypotension events, were balanced 
in the empagliflozin (106 patients, 5.7%) and placebo groups (103 patients, 5.5%. However, the 
frequencies for volume depletion (narrow BIcMQ) and hypotension (BIcMQ) leading to discontinuation or 
reported as SAEs were numerically higher in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group.

Hypoglycaemia  
The frequencies for confirmed hypoglycaemic events overall and in subgroups by T2DM status at baseline 
were balanced between treatment groups (Table 34). Patients without T2DM did not have any severe 
hypoglycaemic events requiring assistance (investigator-defined). 
Bone fracture  
The frequencies for bone fracture (BIcMQ) were similar between treatment groups. Investigator-defined 
bone fractures were reported for 45 patients (2.4%) in the empagliflozin group and for 43 patients 
(2.3%) in the placebo group. No relevant difference was observed for events leading to discontinuation or 
reported as SAEs or when including also the events up to trial completion (Table 34). 
Urinary tract malignancy  
Urinary tract malignancy events on treatment or up to trial completion were infrequent and balanced in 
both treatment groups, with 9 patients (0.5%) in the empagliflozin group and 7 patients (0.4%) in the 
placebo group (Table 34). 
Unexpected AEs 
Fall  
In 1245.121, the PT fall was reported for more patients in the empagliflozin group (43patients, 2.3%) 
than in the placebo group (27patients, 1.4%). Very few patients discontinued study medication due to the 
fall (Table 43)

Fall occurred in a similar number of patients between groups up to Day 240, suggesting no relation to 
initiation of treatment with empagliflozin. After Day 240, the increase in number of patients with falls was 
steady in the empagliflozin group, while the increase in the placebo group appeared to level off. 
Medical review of all patients who had fallen did not identify any predominant pathophysiological cause 
for falls (e.g. volume depletion, hypotension, or hypoglycaemia). The imbalance appeared to be mainly 
due to falls from an external cause; some falls were initially reported as ‘accidental fall’ or ‘mechanical 
fall’, implying there was an external influence causing the patient to fall or it was stated that the fall was 
due to the patients’ carelessness, such as tripping over something while walking. Furthermore, 
hypoglycaemia, investigator-defined symptomatic hypotension, and the PT loss of consciousness 
(reported for 3 patients in each group, 0.2%) were balanced between treatment groups. Furthermore, 
hypoglycaemia, investigator-defined symptomatic hypotension and the PT loss of consciousness (reported 
for 3 patients in each group, 0.2%) were balanced between treatment groups.  
In the previous large outcome trial in patients with T2DM and established CV disease (1245.25, EMPA-
REG OUTCOME), patients with fall trended to disfavour empagliflozin (placebo 60 (2.6%), empagliflozin 
10mg 68 (2.9%), empagliflozin 71 (3.0%)).

Post-marketing data for empagliflozin were examined and no case suggestive for a causal association 
between empagliflozin and fall other than falls as a consequence of presyncope or syncope (a known side 
effect of empagliflozin) was identified. 
Constipation  
In 1245.121, the PT constipation was reported for more patients in the empagliflozin group (57 patients, 
3.1%) than in the placebo group (27 patients, 1.4%), which was observed across all subgroups. Few 
patients had serious events or discontinued treatment due to the events (Table 44).

In SAF-HF2, very few patients had constipation (empagliflozin: 3 patients, 1.0%; placebo: 4 patients,  
1.3%), and none of the events was severe, drug-related, led to treatment discontinuation, or serious. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In 1245.121, SAEs (but not AESIs) that were components of efficacy endpoints or 
consequences/complications of the underlying disease were exempted from reporting on the SAE form, 
regardless of relationship to the study medication. 
In 1245.121, the overall frequency of SAEs was lower in the empagliflozin group than the placebo group 
(Table 45). Serious adverse events were most frequently reported in the SOC cardiac disorders. On the 
PT level, cardiac failure, pneumonia, ventricular tachycardia (see below for details), and acute kidney 
injury were the most frequently reported SAEs. All other PTs in the SOC cardiac disorders were reported 
for <3.0% of patients in either group.

Patient #2616033010 (empagliflozin group; post-treatment, on 10 Nov 2019) and #2616033021 (placebo group; on-
treatment, on 27 Aug 2019) were each reported with an SAE “exacerbation of HF” after the database was locked and 
were therefore not included in the study database.  
In SAF-HF2, the frequency of patients reported with SAEs was lower in the empagliflozin group (41 
patients, 13.1%) than in the placebo group (56 patients, 17.8%). The difference was mainly due to PT 
cardiac failure, reported for fewer patients in the empagliflozin group (12 patients, 3.8%) than in the 
placebo group (25 patients, 8.0%). 
Ventricular tachycardia  
In 1245.121, serious events of PT ventricular tachycardia were reported for more patients in the 
empagliflozin group (55 patients, 3.0%) than in the placebo group (37 patients, 2.0%). Very few patients 
discontinued the study medication due to ventricular tachycardia. When medically relevant PTs were 
analysed together in the SMQ ventricular tachyarrhythmia (post hoc), the incidence rate of the serious 
events between the treatment groups was similar (incidence rate adjusted for the time at risk: 
empagliflozin 2.92/100 pt-yrs vs placebo 2.39/100 pt-yrs) 
Except for the PT ventricular tachycardia, no obvious differences between groups were observed for other 
PTs in the SMQ ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Especially, no differences were seen in the proportion of 
patients with clinically less severe ventricular tachyarrhythmia such as isolated premature ventricular 
complexes (extrasystoles) or patients with more severe ventricular tachyarrhythmia such as ventricular 
fibrillation or torsade de pointes (Table 46)

The frequency of patients with new ECG findings any time in the study after baseline was balanced 
between treatment groups (empagliflozin 39.6% vs placebo 39.8%). Furthermore, the risk of heart 
failure hospitalisations, recurrent heart failure hospitalisations, and investigator-defined CV 
hospitalisations were reduced with empagliflozin treatment, and fewer patients were reported with CEC-
defined sudden cardiac death in the empagliflozin group (70 patients, 3.8%) than in the placebo group 
(81 patients, 4.3%).  
In the previous large outcome trial in patients with T2DM and established CV disease (1245.25, EMPA-
REG OUTCOME), the SMQ ventricular tachyarrhythmia or PT ventricular tachycardia was reported for 
fewer patients in the 2 empagliflozin groups than in the placebo group (placebo 13 patients, 0.6%, 
empagliflozin 10mg 3 patients, 0.1%, empagliflozin 25mg 9 patients, 0.4%) 
Laboratory findings 
Safety laboratory values measured within 3 days after the last intake of study medication were 
considered as “on-treatment”, except for creatinine and eGFR (up to 1 day after the last intake were 
used, to reflect the rapid change in plasma volume).  
Haemoglobin and haematocrit values increased and then partially returned to baseline in the 
empagliflozin group at follow up (about 30 days after treatment stop); almost no change was observed in 
the placebo group. Uric acid decreased in the empagliflozin group and then partially returned to baseline 
at follow up. There were no relevant changes in the rest of the safety laboratory parameters in 1245.121.  
In SAF-HF2, the trends were consistent with those in 1245.121 
Safety in special populations 
Subgroup analyses of AEs were carried out by demographic and baseline characteristics (age, sex, race, 
geographic region, ethnicity, diabetes status at baseline, baseline eGFR, baseline blood pressure, and 
baseline use of certain heart failure medications). 
In 1245.121, AEs in the subgroups showed trends generally consistent with the overall AE profile in the 
trial, including in subgroups with or without T2DM and by eGFR categories at baseline (including patients 
with an eGFR of <30 mL/min/1.73 m2). No relevant difference in renal adverse events or volume 
depletion including hypotension was observed in patients with or without controlled blood pressure or 
certain HF medications such as RAAS blockade and diuretics at baseline. 
In SAF-HF2, no relevant treatment differences were observed in any subgroup, including between HFrEF 
and HFpEF. 
Diabetes status at baseline  
In 1245.121, AE profile by T2DM status at baseline was consistent with the overall AE profile in the trial

In SAF-HF2, the frequency of patients reported with AEs leading to discontinuation was similar between 
treatment groups (18 patients, 5.8% for empagliflozin vs 18 patients, 5.7% for placebo). At PT level, AEs 
leading to discontinuation were reported for no more than 1 patient per group, except for cardiac failure 
(1 patient, 0.3% vs 2 patients, 0.6%) and asthma (0 patient vs 2 patients, 0.6%). 
Post marketing experience 
As empagliflozin has not been approved for use in patients with HF and without T2DM, there has been no 
post-marketing experience in these patients. 
3.4.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In 1245.121 trial (EMPEROR reduced), the proportion of patient with mild AEs was higher in the 
empagliflozin group (placebo 393 patients, 21.1% vs empagliflozin 445 patients, 23.9%). However, the 
proportion of subject with moderate and/or severe AEs was larger in the placebo group (moderate: 568 
patients, 30.5% vs 516 patients, 27.7%, severe: 502 patients, 26.9% vs 459 patients, 24.6%). The 
latter was probably driven by a smaller proportion of the empagliflozin group reporting SAEs that required 
or prolonged hospitalisation compared with the placebo group. Regarding the most frequently reported 
AEs, this was in general numerically balanced between both groups.  
Evaluating the severe AEs, Table 32 describes the number of patients with AEs by worst intensity and the 
most frequent severe AEs, showing that infections and infestation were numerically more in the 
empagliflozin group (80 patients, 4.3%) compared with placebo (66 patients, 3.5%). 
Investigator-defined urinary tract infection (including urosepsis and acute pyelonephritis) were reported 
for 92 patients, 4.9%, in the empagliflozin group and 83 patients, 4.5%, in the placebo group. Although 
reported urosepsis did not numerically differ between groups (empagliflozin 5 patients, 0.3% vs placebo 4 
patients, 0.2%), there was a difference in reported sepsis with source from urinary tract infection (UTI), 
especially in female subjects (empagliflozin 5 patients, 1.1%, all female vs placebo 1 patient, 0.1%, 
male).  
In 1245.121, the results of the AESIs and specific AEs were in general consistent with the known safety 
profile of empagliflozin in patients with T2DM. As expected, genital infections were more often reported in 
the empagliflozin group (31 patients, 1.7% vs. placebo 12 patients, 0.6%). Although the reported 
complicated genital infections were numerically equally distributed between the treatment groups, the 
genital infection did lead more often to discontinuation of treatment in the empagliflozin group. This is a 
known AE and is described in the SmPC Section 4.8. Although genital infections were reported in both 
male and female subjects and in patients with and without diabetes, the effect of treatment seems more 
pronounced in male subjects and in subjects with diabetes based on the current results of the trial. This 
was included in the SmPC Section 4.8. 
The AE hypotension is also more often reported during empagliflozin treatment (130 patients, 7.0% vs. 
placebo 119 patients, 6.4%). This is described in the SmPC section 4.4. and 4.8, but the effect of 
empagliflozin on hypotension and volume depletion is seemingly more present in patients with T2DM 
compared to non-diabetic subjects. This could be expected as the effect of glucosuria is more present in 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/275072/2021 
Page 82/96 
 
 
  
  
 
  
this patients’ group. However, as the presented data does not change the risk for subject with T2DM 
compared to the described warnings in the SmPC and is not increased for subjects without T2DM, it is 
acceptable to maintain this information and the related warning in the SmPC on an overall group level for 
both subjects with and without T2DM.  
The MAH provided additional data for the event of volume depletion, hypotension and symptomatic 
hypotension divided for age and the presence of T2DM. As expected, volume depletion during 
empagliflozin treatment was more frequent in patients with age ≥ 75 years. In elderly patients with T2DM 
the increase of hypotension and volume depletion was even more pronounced during empagliflozin vs. 
placebo. This is addressed in the SmPC Section 4.4 and Section 4.8.  
The frequencies for volume depletion and hypotension leading to discontinuation (empagliflozin 14 
patients, 0.8% vs placebo 6 patients, 0.3%) or reported as SAEs (empagliflozin 43 patients, 2.3% vs 
placebo 33 patients, 1.8%) were numerically higher in the empagliflozin group compared with the placebo 
group. This seems clinically relevant. 
Volume depletion could also contribute to constipation. Based on relative dehydration, constipation is at 
least plausible as an ADR. The increased number of constipations with empagliflozin treatment in the 
EMPEROR-Reduced trial was consisted between subgroups. The difference was also statistically different 
with a relative risk of 2,11 (CI 1,34; 3,32), the SmPC was updated to include constipation as a common 
adverse reaction in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Acute renal failure (empagliflozin 175 patients, 9.4% vs. placebo 192 patients, 10.3%), acute kidney 
injury (35 patients, 1.9% vs. 55 patients, 3.0%) and renal failure (44 patients, 2.4% vs. 48 patients, 
2.6%) were less reported during empagliflozin treatment compared with placebo. However, renal 
impairment is more often reported during empagliflozin treatment (105 patients, 5.6% vs. placebo 93 
patients, 5.0%).  
No relevant increase in the frequency of keto-acidosis for the empagliflozin group, but more patients in 
the empagliflozin group (174 patients, 11.0%) than the placebo group (113 patients, 7.1%) had 
bicarbonate values that shifted from normal at baseline to below normal at last value on treatment. The 
frequency of patients with PCSA of low bicarbonate values (<18 mmol/L) was greater in the empagliflozin 
group (273 patients, 16.1%) than the placebo group (197 patients, 11.6%). This seemingly does not lead 
to an increased risk for metabolic acidosis. The risk of metabolic acidosis is mainly present when other 
risk factors are also present, as described in the SmPC Section 4.4. It is therefore considered reasonable 
to assume that the higher percentage of patients with a decrease in bicarbonate levels is only clinically 
relevant in patients with other risk factors. 
Fall is more often reported during empagliflozin treatment (43 patients, 2.3% vs placebo 27 patients, 
1.4%), but further review did not identify any predominant pathophysiological cause for falls (e.g. volume 
depletion, hypotension, or hypoglycaemia). The MAH suggests that the imbalance in reported falls 
between the groups is due to external causes and to a higher number of accidental falls. The MAH 
concludes that considering the late divergence in falls between treatment groups (after about 8 months), 
the lack of a plausible pathophysiological cause related to empagliflozin’s mode of action (e.g. via 
hypotension, volume depletion, hypoglycaemia) the numerical imbalance of fall observed was likely a 
chance variation. However, although less pronounced, also in the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial a slight 
increase in reported falls was present during empagliflozin and especially in the 25 mg group.  
Although not confirmed, it is considered plausible that falls are related to the haemodynamic changes 
related to empagliflozin use. There is indeed no pathophysiological explanation for the increased number 
of accidental falls during empagliflozin evident yet. However, the higher number of falls with empagliflozin 
vs. placebo treatment is consistent between all different subgroups and appears more pronounced for 
female subjects. Although no additional risk factors have been identified, the number of falls is 
consistently more in the empagliflozin group vs. placebo. Also based on the relative risk of 1,59 (ci: 0,99; 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/275072/2021 
Page 83/96 
 
 
  
  
 
 
2,57). However, there was no imbalance of falls defined by the investigators as “drug related”. In fact, no 
such cases were reported in the empagliflozin group (0%) but one case in the placebo group (0.1%).  
Based on this, the risk does not have to be included in the SmPC, section 4.8. However, as the 
explanation for the increased number of falls during empagliflozin remains uncertain, this risk should 
remain in the RMP.   
Regarding SAEs reported in the SOC cardiac disorders, ventricular tachycardias were more often reported 
during empagliflozin (55 patients, 3.0%) compared with placebo (37 patients, 2.0%). This difference 
between treatment groups was not observed for other ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Moreover, it was not 
observed consistently between different trials with empagliflozin. In the previous large outcome trial in 
patients with T2DM and established CV disease EMPA-REG OUTCOME, ventricular tachycardia was 
reported for fewer patients in the two empagliflozin groups than in the placebo group. It could, however, 
be suggested that the current finding is related to the presence of HFrEF combined with empagliflozin 
treatment and may therefore not occur as often in patients without HFrEF. But when analysing only the 
subjects with HFrEF and T2DM in the EMPA-REG trial, the events of ventricular tachycardia were not more 
during empagliflozin vs. placebo (placebo 7/244 (2.9%), empagliflozin 10mg 0/240 (0%), empagliflozin 
25mg 7/222 (3.2%)). 
Reported acute myocardial infarction was numerically imbalanced between the groups (empagliflozin 24 
patients, 1.3%, placebo 18 patients, 1.0%). However, the MAH also provided the numbers of myocardial 
infarction adjudicated by an independent CEC, with empagliflozin 10 mg: 19 patients, 1.0%; placebo: 20 
patients, 1.1%. This is comparable between groups and although there is a small discrepancy between 
the reviews of the number myocardial infarction, it appears balanced between the groups. 
Nervous system disorders were more often reported during empagliflozin treatment (94 patients, 5.0%) 
compared with placebo (74 patients, 4.0%). This difference between the groups did not consist of 
differences in reported ischaemic strokes. Additional data with the most frequent SAEs under the SOC 
nervous system disorders shows a small imbalance and that this is mainly due to the larger number of 
cerebrovascular attacks, presyncope and syncope. The latter may be due to the known side-effect of 
empagliflozin of volume depletion, described in the SmPC section 4.4. Based on the number of strokes 
adjudicated by the CEC, the numbers between the group appear comparable.  
“Bone fracture” is included as an important potential risk in the EU RMP. No imbalance regarding these 
events were noted for patients with T2DM treated with empagliflozin vs placebo (2.2% vs 2.8%). 
However, in the non-T2DM group an imbalance were noted, 1.7% (n=16) of in the placebo group 
compared to 2.7% (n=25) reported any event of bone fracture. This appears contradictive, as patients 
with T2DM are considered to have a larger risk than the non-diabetic population to develop bone 
fractures. Most of the studies investigating the effect of empagliflozin are performed in T2DM patients and 
the body composition sub-study of 1245.28 did not indicate an increased de-mineralisation in bone 
mineral density with empagliflozin treatment compared with glimepiride in T2DM patients. There is no 
evident pathophysiological explanation why in patients without T2DM the effect of empagliflozin on bone 
mineral density and bone fracture would be of a larger risk than in T2DM patients. The difference between 
patients with and without T2DM on bone fractures with empagliflozin is therefore not considered an issue, 
but the risk for bone fracture should remain included as an important potential risk in the EU RMP.  
3.4.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile of empagliflozin in HF is similar to the established safety profile in the T2DM indication.

3.4.3.  PSUR cycle  
Based on safety data of the new indication in HFrEF, the CHMP is of the opinion that the already existing 
entry in the EURD list for empagliflozin needs to be amended as follows: the PSUR cycle for the medicinal 
product should follow a one yearly cycle. The next data lock point will be 17/04/2022.

MODULE SVII Identified and potential risks 
No new safety concerns have been identified by the MAH following new data from clinical trials in patients 
with HFrEF (trials 1245.121 and 1245.168). 
The  MAH  has  updated  the  characterisation  of  the  identified  and  potential  risks,  with  risk  analyses  from 
HFrEF trials (1245.121 and 1245.168). Moreover, characterisation of all risk has also been updated taking 
into account the new safety analysis set (SAF 43) for T2DM indication. 
*Part VI Summary of the risk management plan 
This part has been updated to include information on the proposed indication of heart failure and updated 
data regarding important risks. 
4.1.  Overall conclusion on the RMP 
No new safety concern has been identified regarding the new indication of heart failure.  
No new additional pharmacovigilance activities have been proposed, which is endorsed.  
No new additional risk minimisation measures have been added either, which is considered acceptable. 
The changes to the RMP are acceptable. 
The RMP version 15.2 (date of final sign off: 09 April 2021) is acceptable.

6.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
6.1.  Therapeutic Context 
Heart failure (HF) has emerged as a global epidemic over the last decades and an estimated prevalence 
of >37.7 million individuals globally. The rise in cardiovascular risk factors, improved survival from 
ischaemic heart disease, as well as age distribution will contribute to a sustained increase in the 
prevalence of HF in developed high-income countries. Despite considerable therapeutic advances in the 
therapy of HF patients, the normal progression of the disease is still associated with increasingly 
worsening symptoms, an increasing frequency of re-hospitalisations, and ultimately a high rate of 
mortality. 
6.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Chronic heart failure (HF) is a progressive syndrome characterized by the inability of the heart to provide 
adequate circulation to meet the metabolic demand of different tissues or do it at the expense of elevated 
left ventricular filling pressure. HF occurs due to failure of the heart to pump adequately (systolic 
dysfunction) and/or impaired relaxation (diastolic dysfunction). Two types of HF have been defined mainly 
based on the Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and also other structural changes in heart muscle: 
heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) <40% and heart failure with preserved ejection 
fraction (HFpEF) ≥50%. Patients with HF can clinically be classified according to the severity of their 
symptoms, and the most commonly used classification system is the New York Heart Association (NYHA) 
Functional Classification. The clinical course for HFrEF patients is often marked by acute episodes of 
clinical decompensation with increased symptoms such as dyspnea, fatigue, and oedema and in more 
severe cases cardiac asthma. The time in between these acute episodes can consist of periods with 
stability, but the normal progression of the disease is still associated with increasingly worsening 
symptoms, an increasing frequency of rehospitalizations, and ultimately a high rate of mortality. 
Approximately 50% of patients who develop HF die within 5 years after diagnosis. Annually, more than 1 
million patients are hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of HF. HF is the most common cause of 
hospitalization among individuals above 65 years of age in the western countries.  
6.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Standard medications for patients with HFrEF and medium-to-severe chronic HF (NYHA classes II to IV) 
are well established and based on large randomized, controlled trials, with the results incorporated into 
guidelines issued by the ACCF/AHA and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC). The standard 
medications include an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or/and an angiotensin receptor 
blocker (ARB), beta-blocker, angiotensin-receptor-neprilysin-inhibitor (ARNIs) and a diuretic in patients 
with evidence of fluid retention. An aldosterone receptor antagonist may be given, especially those who 
have experienced an acute myocardial infarction or have a history of diabetes mellitus. Despite 
considerable advances in the therapy of HF patients, even in patients on optimized therapy the normal 
progression of the disease is, as described above, still associated with increasingly worsening symptoms, 
an increasing frequency of rehospitalizations and a high rate of mortality.  
Studies investigating the effect sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT 2) inhibitors observed beneficial 
effects on HF-related complications in patients with or without diabetes. Empagliflozin is an orally 
administered SGLT-2 inhibitor and is approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 
worldwide. The results of trial 1245.25 (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) in patients with T2DM and established CV 
disease showed that empagliflozin reduced the risk of hospitalisation for heart failure (HHF) and the 
composite endpoint of HHF or CV death.

6.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Empagliflozin is an orally administered, potent and selective inhibitor of the human sodium-glucose 
cotransporter-2 (SGLT 2) developed by Boehringer Ingelheim (BI). By inhibition of SGLT 2 in the kidneys 
empagliflozin reduces the reabsorption of glucose by the kidneys leading to increased urinary glucose 
excretion and, in consequence, to a lowering of blood glucose. Empagliflozin is approved for the 
treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) worldwide as an adjunct therapy to diet and exercise to 
improve glycaemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes. The results of the EMPA-REG OUTCOME trial 
(Empagliflozin Cardiovascular Outcome Event Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus Patients) significantly 
improved the primary composite cardiovascular outcome (MACE-3) and significantly reduced 
cardiovascular death, hospitalization for heart failure (HHF) as well as death from any cause as compared 
to standard of care. These beneficial cardiovascular effects were found to be largely independent of the 
glucose-lowering effect of empagliflozin. Based on the results of trial 1245.25 (EMPA-REG OUTCOME) in 
patients with T2DM and established CV disease, BI initiated a phase III program for empagliflozin 10 mg 
once daily in chronic heart failure regardless of diabetes status. 
In the current application, the main clinical study was the pivotal trial EMPEROR-reduced, in patients with 
HFrEF, trial 1245.121. The supportive EMPERIAL trials were also included. The aim of the EMPERIAL-
reduced/preserved trials is to evaluate the effect of empagliflozin 10 mg versus placebo on exercise 
ability using the 6-minute walking test (6MWT) in patients with HFrEF or HFpEF. The EMPERIAL-reduced 
and -preserved trial (1245.168 and 1245.167) included 312 and 315 subjects respectively and had a 
duration of 12 weeks.  
EMPEROR reduced – trial 1245.121 
The EMPEROR trial is a phase III international, multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group, randomised, 
placebo-controlled, event-driven trial investigating the long-term effect of empagliflozin in reducing the 
risk of hospitalisation for HF and of cardiovascular death in patients with heart failure. The key eligibility 
criteria for the EMPEROR reduced trial were a population of T2DM and non-T2DM, aged > 18 years, 
chronic HF (NYHA class II-IV) with reduced EF (LVEF ≤40%) and elevated NT-proBNP for patients 
with/without atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (AF), eGFR (CKD-EPI)cr ≥ 20 mL/min/1.73 m2 and stable 
therapy for HF consistent with local and international cardiology guidelines. The design of the study 
included a screening period of 4-28 days, a randomized, double-blind treatment period (event-driven 
study duration), in which eligible patients started with 10 mg empagliflozin or matching placebo. The 
median follow-up was 16 months of treatment. At the end of treatment, each subject was followed for 30 
days after the last treatment dose. The aim of the EMPEROR-reduced trial is to investigate the safety and 
efficacy of empagliflozin versus placebo on top of guideline-directed medical therapy in patients with 
HFrEF. The primary endpoint was the time to the first event of adjudicated CV death or adjudicated HHF. 
The two key secondary endpoints (confirmatory) were the occurrence of adjudicated HHF (first and 
recurrent) and eGFR (CKD-EPI)cr slope of change from baseline. The EMPEROR-reduced trial (1245.121) 
included 3730 subjects. Subjects who fulfil all eligibility criteria were randomized double
manner.  
blind in a 1:1 
‐
Based on the results of the pivotal trial 1245.121, BI sought a new indication for empagliflozin to reduce 
the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalisation for heart failure and to slow kidney function decline in 
adult patients with heart failure (NYHA class II-IV) with reduced ejection fraction.  
6.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoint of CV death or HHF occurred in a lower proportion of patients in the empagliflozin 
group (361 of 1863 patients, 19.4%) than in the placebo group (462 of 1867 patients, 24.7%), and the 
risk of CV death or HHF was significantly reduced with empagliflozin treatment compared with placebo 
(HR empagliflozin vs. placebo 0.75; 95% CI 0.65 to 0.86, p<0.0001). The treatment effect of 
empagliflozin became apparent shortly after randomisation and was maintained throughout the trial. In 
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/275072/2021

general, the results were consistent across the pre-defined subgroups by demographics, baseline 
characteristics (including T2DM status), and baseline HF medications. 
A lower proportion of patients in the empagliflozin group (246 patients, 13.2%) than in the placebo group 
(342 patients, 18.3%) had an adjudicated HHF event, and the total number of HHF events (first and 
recurrent) was also lower in the empagliflozin group (388 patients) than in the placebo group (553 
patients). Treatment with empagliflozin reduced the risk of recurrent HHF compared with placebo 
(HR 0.70, 95.04% CI 0.58 to 0.85, p = 0.0003). 
Death from any cause occurred in 249 patients (13.4%) in the empagliflozin group and 266 patients 
(14.2%) in the placebo group (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.10), but did not reach statistical significance. 
The majority of the deaths were due to CV causes. However, adjudicated CV death did not differ between 
the treatment groups and occurred in 187 patients (10.0%) in the empagliflozin group and 202 patients 
(10.8%) in the placebo group (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.12, nominal p = 0.4133).  
First all-cause hospitalisation was reduced with empagliflozin treatment (688 patients, 36.9% vs placebo 
796 patients, 42.6%; HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.95). This finding seems mainly driven by hospitalisation 
for investigator defined CV cause (empagliflozin 452 patients, 24.3% vs placebo 570 patients, 30.5%; HR 
0.75, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.85). 
6.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Treatment with empagliflozin resulted in a decreased occurrence of the composite primary endpoint of CV 
death or HHF occurred in patients with or without T2DM. This effect seems mainly driven by a decrease in 
HHF outcomes. When evaluated separately, a lower proportion of patients in the empagliflozin group than 
in the placebo group had an adjudicated HHF event. However, this treatment effect was not observed on 
CV death. The time to adjudicated CV death was a secondary endpoint and occurred in 187 patients 
(10.0%) in the empagliflozin group and 202 patients (10.8%) in the placebo group (HR 0.92, 95% CI 
0.75 to 1.12).  
The change of eGFR slope from baseline was a key secondary endpoint as analysed under hierarchical 
testing to support the indication and showed a slower decline in eGFR in the empagliflozin group, with an 
estimated difference in slope of 1.733 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year vs placebo (99.9% CI 0.669, 2.796; 
p<0.0001). However, robustness and clinical interpretation of this finding may be questioned due to 
several reasons, already reflected in the 2016 scientific advice provided to the MAH.  
First of all, a recent large meta-analysis based on efforts from a renal consortium (Inker et al, JASN, 
2019; Levey et al, JASN, 2019) suggest at least a minimal mean follow-up of 2 years, and preferably, 3 
years follow-up (current analysis only provides a substantially lower mean follow-up) to reliably assess 
GFR-slope as a potential surrogate for clinical renal outcome.  
Also, any potentially surrogacy is further questioned as this meta-analysis provides little support for using 
GFR slope in HF patients, due to substantial underrepresentation. Further, clinical interpretation is 
complicated as no minimal threshold has been justified and defined a-priori. Although, some support on 
clinical relevance based on limited data has been presented on an exploratory endpoint of the composite 
of GFR>40%, ESRD, and renal death, which was mainly driven by the GFR>40% reduction component 
(30/1863 in the empagliflozin group and 58/1867 in the placebo group, HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.32 - 0.77) 
and a beneficial effect as explored on the albuminuria biomarker.  
Moreover, the analysis has been performed based on the so called ‘’chronic slope’’ (not from baseline but 
analysed after the initial GFR dip). Analysis of the ‘’chronic slope’’’ can be subject to particular concerns 
including a non-randomized analysis, potentially inflation of type 1 error with a potential overestimation 
of the effect in advantage of the intervention, and thus possibly increasing drawing false conclusions. 
However, results of the preferred (more conservative) overall slope as analysed from baseline confirmed 
that empagliflozin did affect the slope.

EMA/CHMP/275072/2021 
Page 91/96 
 
 
  
  
 
The KCCQ was used to measure patient-reported outcomes. KCCQ consists of several domains and 
summary scores. Treatment with empagliflozin improved the KCCQ clinical summary score from baseline 
to Week 52 compared with placebo (mean change from baseline 1.75, 95% CI 0.51 to 2.99). The MAH 
justifies the choice for the KCCQ clinical summary score as most relevant to the patient. However, in this 
trial, each patient was asked to identify the domain that was the most difficult to cope with from the 
patients’ perspective at baseline and the most common domain the patients identified was total symptom 
(i.e. symptom frequency and burden; 32% of patients) and physical limitation (21% of patients). This 
patients’ preferred KCCQ outcome did not differ between treatment groups. But the ‘patient preferred 
outcome’ has limitations, as this was only asked once at baseline and no time-dependency was assessed, 
in contrast to the standard KCCQ. The validated scores of the KCCQ are therefore considered more 
reliable to evaluate the patient related outcomes. Change in HF symptoms was measured as 
improvements in NYHA class with empagliflozin treatment in an exploratory endpoint.  
More patients in the empagliflozin group (360 patients, 26.8%) than in the placebo group (303 patients, 
22.8%) improved in NYHA class from baseline to Week 52, and fewer patients in the empagliflozin group 
(48 patients, 3.6%) than in the placebo group (75 patients, 5.6%) worsened. However, the EMPERIAL 
trials were specifically designed to evaluate the effect of empagliflozin on exercise ability using the 6-
minute walking test (6MWT) in patients with HFrEF or HFpEF, but in both trials, the primary endpoint 
(change from baseline to Week 12 in the 6MWT distance) did not show a statistically significant difference 
between empagliflozin and placebo.  
6.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Treatment with empagliflozin 10 mg in patients with HFrEF revealed no new safety findings compared 
with the known safety profile of empagliflozin in patients with T2DM. The safety profile for patients with 
HFrEF and without T2DM was in general similar to those with T2DM.  
In 1245.121 trial (EMPEROR reduced), the proportion of patient with mild AEs was higher in the 
empagliflozin group (placebo 393 patients, 21.1% vs empagliflozin 445 patients, 23.9%). However, the 
proportion of subject with moderate and/or severe AEs was larger in the placebo group (moderate: 568 
patients, 30.5% vs 516 patients, 27.7%, severe: 502 patients, 26.9% vs 459 patients, 24.6%). 
Evaluating the severe AEs, infections, and infestation were numerically more in the empagliflozin group 
(80 patients, 4.3%) compared with placebo (66 patients, 3.5%). Although “urosepsis” did not numerically 
differ between groups (empagliflozin 5 patients, 0.3% vs placebo 4 patients, 0.2%), there was a 
difference in “sepsis with source from urinary tract infection (UTI)”, especially in female subjects 
(empagliflozin 5 patients, (1.1%, all female) vs placebo 1 patient, (0.1%, male).  
Genital infections were also more often reported in the empagliflozin group (31 patients, 1.7% vs. 
placebo 12 patients, 0.6%). Although the reported complicated genital infections were numerically 
equally distributed between the treatment groups, genital infection did lead more often to discontinuation 
of treatment in the empagliflozin group. This is a known AE and is described in the SmPC Section 4.8.  
The AE hypotension is also more often reported during empagliflozin treatment (130 patients, 7.0% vs. 
placebo 119 patients, 6.4%). This is described in the SmPC section 4.4. and 4.8. The effect of 
empagliflozin on hypotension and volume depletion is seemingly more present in patients with T2DM 
compared to non-diabetic subjects.  
Renal impairment was more often reported during empagliflozin treatment (105 patients, 5.6% vs. 
placebo 93 patients, 5.0%), but importantly acute renal failure (empagliflozin 175 patients, 9.4% vs. 
placebo 192 patients, 10.3%), acute kidney injury (35 patients, 1.9% vs. 55 patients, 3.0%) and renal 
failure (44 patients, 2.4% vs. 48 patients, 2.6%) were less reported during empagliflozin treatment 
compared with placebo.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/275072/2021 
Page 92/96 
 
 
  
  
 
Fall was more often reported during empagliflozin treatment (43 patients, 2.3% vs placebo 27 patients, 
1.4%). 
Also, constipation was reported for more patients in the empagliflozin group (57 patients, 3.1%) than in 
the placebo group (27 patients, 1.4%), which was observed across all subgroups.  
From SAEs reported in the SOC cardiac disorders, ventricular tachycardia was more often reported during 
empagliflozin (55 patients, 3.0%) compared with placebo (37 patients, 2.0%). Acute myocardial 
infarction was numerically imbalanced between the groups (empagliflozin 24 patients, 1.3%, placebo 18 
patients, 1.0%).  
SAEs in the SOC nervous system disorders were more often reported during empagliflozin treatment (94 
patients, 5.0%) compared with placebo (74 patients, 4.0%). This difference between the groups did not 
consist of differences in reported ischaemic strokes but was mainly due to the larger number of 
cerebrovascular attacks and presyncope/syncope. The latter may be due to the known side-effect of 
empagliflozin of volume depletion, described in the SmPC section 4.4. 
6.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Genital infections occurred as expected more in the empagliflozin group (31 patients, 1.7% vs. placebo 
12 patients, 0.6%). Although genital infections were reported in both male and female subjects and in 
patients with and without diabetes, the effect of treatment seems more pronounced in male subjects and 
in subjects with diabetes; this was included in the SmPC Section 4.8.  
The AE hypotension was more often reported during empagliflozin treatment. The MAH considered the 
increases not clinically relevant, as the frequencies of investigator-defined symptomatic hypotension 
events, which would represent clinically relevant hypotension events, were balanced in the empagliflozin 
(106 patients, 5.7%) and placebo groups (103 patients, 5.5%). However, the frequencies for volume 
depletion and hypotension leading to discontinuation (empagliflozin 14 patients, 0.8% vs placebo 6 
patients, 0.3%) or reported as SAEs (empagliflozin 43 patients, 2.3% vs placebo 33 patients, 1.8%) were 
numerically higher in the empagliflozin group compared with the placebo group. This seems, therefore, 
clinically relevant. 
Moreover, the effect of empagliflozin on hypotension and volume depletion is seemingly more present in 
patients with T2DM compared to non-diabetic subjects. This could be expected, as the effect of glucosuria 
is more present in this patients’ group. In the current SmPC, it is already described that patients aged 75 
years or older are more at risk to develop volume depletion with empagliflozin and additional analysis of 
the EMPEROR-Reduced showed that the risk is even more pronounced for elderly patients with HFrEF and 
with T2DM.  
More patients in the empagliflozin group (174 patients, 11.0%) than the placebo group (113 patients, 
7.1%) had bicarbonate values that shifted from normal at baseline to below normal at last value on 
treatment. The frequency of patients with a clinically significant abnormality of low bicarbonate values 
(<18 mmol/L) was greater in the empagliflozin group (273 patients, 16.1%) than the placebo group (197 
patients, 11.6%). Importantly, no increase in the frequency of keto-acidosis was reported for the 
empagliflozin group (11 patients, 0.6% vs placebo 18 patients, 1.0%). 
In the EMPEROR reduced trial, the acute myocardial infarction was numerically imbalanced between the 
groups (empagliflozin 24 patients, 1.3%, placebo 18 patients, 1.0%). This is small difference which has 
not been reported before. However, the MAH provided the numbers of myocardial infarction adjudicated 
by an independent CEC, with empagliflozin 10 mg: 19 patients, 1.0%; placebo: 20 patients, 1.1%. This is 
comparable between groups and although there is a small discrepancy between the reviews of the 
number myocardial infarction, it appears balanced between the groups.  
Extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/275072/2021 
Page 93/96 
 
 
  
  
 
In addition, ventricular tachycardia were more often reported during empagliflozin (55 patients, 3.0%) 
compared with placebo (37 patients, 2.0%). In the previous large outcome trial in patients with T2DM 
and established CV disease EMPA-REG OUTCOME, ventricular tachycardia was reported for fewer patients 
in the two empagliflozin groups than in the placebo group. It could, however, be suggested that the 
current finding is related to the presence of HFrEF combined with empagliflozin treatment and may 
therefore not occur as often in patients without HFrEF. Evaluating only the subjects with HFrEF and T2DM 
in the EMPA-REG trial, the events of ventricular tachycardia were not more during empagliflozin vs. 
placebo (placebo 7/244 (2.9%), empagliflozin 10mg 0/240 (0%), empagliflozin 25mg 7/222 (3.2%)). 
Fall is more often reported during empagliflozin treatment (43 patients, 2.3% vs placebo 27 patients, 
1.4%). Review of the cases did not identify any predominant pathophysiological cause for falls (e.g. 
volume depletion, hypotension, or hypoglycaemia). The MAH attributes this finding to chance, also 
considering the late divergence in falls between treatment groups (after about 8 months), the presumed 
lack of a plausible pathophysiological cause related to empagliflozin’s mode of action (e.g. via 
hypotension, volume depletion, hypoglycaemia), and the lack of consistency between the clinical trial 
results. However, although less pronounced, in EMPA-REG OUTCOME an increase in reported falls was 
present during empagliflozin and especially in the 25 mg group. Post-marketing data for empagliflozin 
were examined, and no specific cause other than falls as a consequence of presyncope was identified. 
Although this could not be confirmed, it is considered plausible that falls are related to the haemodynamic 
changes related to empagliflozin use. 
No imbalance regarding “Bone fracture” were noted for patients with T2DM treated with empagliflozin vs 
placebo (2.2% vs 2.8%). However, in the non-T2DM group an imbalance were noted, 1.7% (n=16) of in 
the placebo group compared to 2.7% (n=25) reported any event of bone fracture. Most of the studies 
investigating the effect of empagliflozin are performed in T2DM patients and the body composition sub-
study of 1245.28 did not indicate an increased de-mineralisation in bone mineral density with 
empagliflozin treatment compared with glimepiride in T2DM patients. There is no evident 
pathophysiological explanation why in patients without T2DM the effect of empagliflozin on bone mineral 
density and bone fracture would be a larger risk than in T2DM patients. The difference between patients 
with and without T2DM on bone fractures with empagliflozin is therefore not considered an issue, but the 
risk for bone fracture should remain included as an important potential risk in the EU RMP.

6.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
6.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
HF is a progressive syndrome with a high, global prevalence. Treatment-induced decrease in HF-related 
complications such as HHF and CV death are therefore important. The finding in the EMPEROR-reduced 
trial of decreased occurrence of HHF or CV death with empagliflozin treatment (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.65 to 
0.86) is an important benefit. During the trial period, the number of patients who would need to be 
treated with empagliflozin to prevent one primary event (NNT) was 19 (95% CI, 13 to 37). Although this 
effect seems mainly due to the decrease in HHF and to a lesser extent to the decrease in CV death, it is 
still regarded as clinically relevant, especially as the normal progression of HF is still associated with a 
high frequency of rehospitalizations and HF is the most common cause of hospitalization among 
individuals above 65 years of age in the western countries.  
The finding of a slower eGFR slope decline with empagliflozin treatment (estimated difference in slope of 
1.733 mL/min/1.73 m2 per year vs placebo (99.9% CI 0.669, 2.796; p<0.0001)), is not regarded as 
convincing as the findings described above. Although this endpoint was a key secondary endpoint, from a 
clinical perspective, the approach is questionable. The slope analysis modelling is regarded as better 
suited to providing some descriptive information on renal outcomes, than providing definitive statistical 
and clinical evidence of an effect as it is used now. This data was supported by a beneficial effect on the 
exploratory renal composite endpoint of (i.e. chronic dialysis, renal transplant, or sustained reduction in 
eGFR), HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.32 - 0.77). This analysis was also driven by change in eGFR and therefore 
partly represents the same information. Even if this may be regarded as promising results, this finding is 
not importantly contributing to the benefit-risk ratio for the indication of HFrEF.  
The potential beneficial effects of empagliflozin on HF-related symptoms are not established in a 
statistically robust way and are, therefore less important. In the EMPEROR-reduced trial, the KCCQ 
‘clinical summary score’ was used to measure the patent reported outcomes, and this was an exploratory 
secondary endpoint. A higher proportion of patients in the empagliflozin group than in the placebo group 
showed a clinically meaningful improvement in this score, but this was not confirmed by the KCCQ score 
of ‘patients preferred outcome’.  
The supportive EMPERIAL trials had the 6MWT distance at 12 weeks as the primary endpoint but did not 
find a treatment benefit. Taken together, the potential beneficial effects on HF-related symptoms are, 
therefore, not importantly contributing to the benefits of treatment with empagliflozin.

Treatment with empagliflozin in patients with HFrEF generally revealed no new major safety findings 
compared with the known safety profile of empagliflozin used in patients with T2DM. The numbers of 
reported AEs were equally distributed between the treatment groups, and the SAEs were numerically 
lower in the empagliflozin group. As expected, genital infections, hypotension and volume depletion were 
more reported during empagliflozin treatment, but these are known side-effects included in the SmPC. 
They have previously not affected the benefit-risk balance to a negative ratio for the indication for the 
treatment of T2DM.  
Two new AEs were identified in the EMPEROR-reduced trial: fall (empagliflozin 43 patients, 2.3% vs 
placebo 27 patients, 1.4%) and constipation (empagliflozin 57 patients, 3.1% vs placebo 27 patients, 
1.4%). 
6.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The MAH agreed to amend the initially applied indication i.e. to include the target condition and target 
population, but no clinical trial endpoints. 
The final agreed indication is: “Jardiance is indicated in adults for the treatment of symptomatic chronic 
heart failure with reduced ejection fraction”.  
The finding of reduced occurrence of HHF or CV death is an important benefit. It is, however, important to 
point out that this finding seems mainly due to the effect on HHF, as no relevant reduction in CV death 
was observed. With the current indication, the beneficial effect on HFF or CV death results in a positive 
benefit-risk ratio, especially as no new major safety issues have been observed. 
The findings on change eGFR slope and renal outcomes are supportive and promising and are addressed 
in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
6.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Jardiance in the treatment of heart failure is positive. 
MAH request for additional market protection 
The MAH requested consideration of its application in accordance with Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) 
726/2004 - one year of market protection for a new indication. However, as part of their Reponses to the 
CHMP request for supplementary information, the MAH informed the CHMP/ EMA that they do not intend 
to pursue the claim for the additional year of market protection in the context of the present procedure.

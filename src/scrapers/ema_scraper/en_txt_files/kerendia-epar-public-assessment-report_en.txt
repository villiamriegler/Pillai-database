2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The approved therapeutic indication  for finerenone is: 
“Kerendia is indicated for the treatment of chronic kidney disease (stage 3 and 4 with albuminuria) 
associated with  type 2 diabetes in adults.” 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
CKD and T2D are each independently major global health concerns. In 2017,  approximately 451 million 
patients worldwide were diagnosed with  T2D, and this  number is expected to  grow to  693 million by 
2045 1. An estimated 20 to 40%  of T2D patients  develop CKD 2, which is characterised by progressive 
damage and irreversible loss of function in the kidney eventually leading to kidney failure. T2D is the 
leading cause of kidney failure in  developed countries 3. Worldwide rates of ESRD are projected to  rise 
in parallel with  the substantial  increase in T2D prevalence 4. CKD is also associated with  increased risks 
of CV mortality and morbidity, as well as impaired quality  of life 5.  
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
The pathophysiology underlying CKD in T2D is complex and there are multiple  factors involved in  the 
progression of CKD and its associated morbidity 6. Contemporary models of CKD in T2D posit 
haemodynamic, metabolic, inflammatory and fibrotic factors as interrelated pathophysiological drivers 
of CKD progression 7.

2.1.4.  Clinical presentation 
Diagnosis, risk stratification and monitoring of CKD is based on assessments of kidney damage using 
urinary albumin excretion, and kidney function using estimations of the GFR 8. Increasing albuminuria 
and decreasing eGFR are robust independent and additive predictors of increasing risk of CV events, 
mortality and accelerated progression of kidney disease. Widespread screening and utilisation  of these 
simple laboratory measures, in accordance with clinical guideline recommendations, has facilitated 
earlier recognition of CKD and has formed the  basis for clinical staging for risk stratification. 
Nevertheless, CKD in  T2D remains underdiagnosed and the  true scale of disease burden is likely 
underestimated. 
Individuals with  T2D have an increased risk of premature CV disease, and in those who develop CKD, 
this risk is further exacerbated 9, 10. There is a 3-fold to 6-fold increase in the risk of CV mortality and 
CV events, respectively, in T2D patients  with  CKD compared to those with  T2D alone 11. 
Although often insidious and asymptomatic, manifesting with  vague non-specific symptoms at early 
stages, more advanced CKD is associated with  deteriorating physical function and quality of life 12, 13, 14. 
The onset of ESRD is associated with high  individual and socioeconomic burden and necessitates renal 
replacement therapy with chronic dialysis or kidney transplantation  to manage kidney failure. Chronic 
dialysis is associated with  considerable morbidity and mortality 15, 16, and although kidney 
transplantation  patients have improved prognosis there is often a prolonged time until  transplantation. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Alongside dietary and lifestyle interventions, current proven pharmacological strategies for CKD 
prevention and treatment  in T2D patients  include optimisation of glycaemic control, blood pressure and 
blood lipid levels. RAS-inhibition using an ACEI or ARB constitute  the current standard of care 
according to  KDIGO 2020, ADA 2019 and joint  ESC/EASD 2019 guidelines 17, 18, 19, 20, 21.

In placebo-controlled studies in patients with  early CKD (i.e. high  albuminuria at baseline), ACEis were 
found to significantly reduce the  risk of all-cause and CV mortality, and of CV morbidity 22; however, 
they were not  prospectively investigated in more advanced stages of CKD. 
In T2D patients with  CKD and very high albuminuria (UACR ≥300  mg/g), losartan reduced the 
incidence of ESRD and a doubling of serum creatinine compared to placebo, but  had no effect on CV 
mortality and CV morbidity 23. Irbesartan was also shown to be effective in delaying the progression of 
kidney disease, but  no significant differences in the rates of CV morbidity or mortality were observed 
compared to placebo 24. 
Recent clinical studies  with SGLT2 inhibitors showed a benefit on cardiorenal outcomes in patients with 
or without  T2D and CKD, with UACR >300  mg/g or >200  mg/g in the CREDENCE 25 and DAPA-CKD 
trials 26. According to recent updates in KDIGO 2020 27, ADA and joint ESC/EASD guidelines from 
2019 28, 29, the use of SGLT2 inhibitors is recommended for patients  with  T2D and CKD. 
Despite treatment  with ACEis or ARBs and the concomitant use of SGLT-2 inhibitors,  there remains a 
high residual risk of cardiorenal outcome events, with  more than twice the  normal observed age-
related decline in kidney function 30.  Existing therapies for CKD in T2D primarily target metabolic and 
haemodynamic factors leaving MR overactivation and aldosterone upregulation untreated. Thus, there 
remains a need for further effective therapies to address the  complex multifactorial underlying disease 
mechanisms including  inflammation and fibrosis in CKD in  a growing global T2D population. 
2.2.  About the product 
Finerenone (company research code: BAY 94-8862)  is a novel, non-steroidal and selective 
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist.  The steroidal hormones, aldosterone and cortisol, are natural 
ligands of the MR. Overactivation of the MR contributes  to organ damage found in  CKD, HF  and 
hypertension, through  mediation of pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects, as well as via sodium 
retention and endothelial dysfunction. 
Finerenone is supplied as immediate-release tablets with  non-functional  film coating for oral once daily 
administration in the  dose strengths 10  and 20  mg.

The proposed clinical use of finerenone is to delay progression of kidney disease and to reduce the risk 
of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in adults with  chronic kidney disease (stage 3 and 4 with 
albuminuria) and type 2 diabetes. 
The agreed during the IMA procedure indication is Kerendia is indicated for the treatment  of chronic 
kidney disease (stage 3 and 4 with  albuminuria) associated with  type 2 diabetes in adults. 
The starting dose of finerenone is 10  mg once daily. After 4 weeks of treatment, the  dose can be 
increased to 20 mg once daily depending on serum potassium and the eGFR response. 
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
The CHMP did not  agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
not considered to be of major public health interest.  This was based on the  following: 
In the FIDELIO-DKD trial, finerenone reduced the risk of the primary as well as key secondary 
composite endpoints, reaching formal statistical  significance for both.  However, the internal validity of 
the study needs to be carefully assessed, considering possible interactions between the treatment and 
relevant clinical variables. Moreover, the clinical relevance of an 18% reduced relative risk warrants 
further assessment. There was also a two-fold  increase in treatment-emergent hyperkalaemia AEs 
observed for finerenone compared to placebo. According to the applicant, hyperkalaemia has been an 
important limiting  factor for the  use of the previously approved MRAs. In addition,  the fact that  the 
disease progresses slowly and that  other treatments  are available undermines the need of early 
availability of finerenone, bearing in mind that  the approval of accelerated assessment would result in 
a reduction of 60  days in the MAA.

2.4.2.  Active Substance 
2.4.2.1.  General  information 
The chemical name of finerenone is (4S)-4-(4-cyano-2-methoxyphenyl)-5-ethoxy-2,8-dimethyl-1,4-
dihydro-1,6-naphthyridine-3-carboxamide corresponding to the molecular formula C21H22N4O3. It has a 
relative molecular weight  of 378.2 and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of finerenone was elucidated by a combination of IR, Raman, UV/Vis, 1H-NMR, 
13C-NMR, MS, and elemental analysis. Single-crystal X-ray structural analysis was performed to 
confirm the absolute configuration. 
Finerenone was examined for polymorphism and pseudo-polymorphism according to the ICH Q6A 
guideline by instrumental  methods of analysis, crystallisation experiments from different solvents and 
from the  melt. Finerenone was found to exist in one modification (modification I). The identity of 
Modification I is determined by XRPD. An amorphous form can exist at room temperature. In addition, 
existence of isomorphic solvates with  different solvents was observed. The solvates are not stable at 
room temperature. Modification I is the thermodynamically stable polymorph and was used throughout 
the whole development for tablet manufacture and will also be used in the manufacture of proposed 
commercial product. The physical form has been controlled during  development in all batches used in 
stability studies, and data presented show that the physical form does not change over time. 
Consequently the  testing of the one modification is not included in the stability programme. 
Polymorphic form is determined by the  crystallisation. Only one form (Modification  I) has been 
detected throughout  development, validation, and stability studies. 
The active substance is a white  to yellow crystalline non-hygroscopic powder. It is soluble in  methanol 
and sparingly soluble in ethanol, acetonitrile and acetone. Its solubility in  aqueous media is strongly 
pH-  dependent, being soluble at pH 1  and practically insoluble at pH above 4.5. 
Finerenone has one stereocentre with  S configuration. Enantiomeric purity is controlled routinely by 
chiral HPLC. 
2.4.2.1.  Manufacture,  characterisation and process controls 
Finerenone is synthesised at two different sites. 
Two additional sites perform micronisation of the  active substance. 
Assessment report  
EMA/78746/2022  
Page 14/159 
 
 
 
 
Finerenone is manufactured by one synthetic route, in  eight steps (five chemical transformations - 
although not  all intermediates are isolated - leading to racemic finerenone, then  resolution, 
crystallisation and physical treatment by micronisation) using four well  defined starting  materials with 
acceptable specifications. Adequate detailed description of the  active substance synthesis process was 
provided in the dossier. 
The choice of starting materials was discussed with  the CHMP in  a Scientific Advice in 2015.  The CHMP 
expressed preliminary support for the proposed starting materials, but highlighted  that  the synthetic 
routes for two  of the  starting materials included compounds with  potential structural alerts for 
genotoxicity, and concluded that  these issues would have to  be addressed in the dossier. The applicant 
has taken the  advice and performed an in silico evaluation of potential  mutagenic impurities  in all four 
proposed starting materials. In the specification for one of the  starting materials, limits are introduced 
on a mg/kg level. For the other starting materials, the applicant came to the  conclusion that  no routine 
controls are necessary. Justifications are in line with  ICH Q11 and the EMA Guideline on the chemistry 
of active substances EMA/454576/2016.  In conclusion, the  proposed starting materials are acceptable. 
Several suppliers were listed for each starting  material, with  differences in reagents, solvents and 
reaction conditions. All suppliers were listed with company names and addresses. Justifications for 
each starting  material were presented, along with  impurity profiles, batch data and specifications. Their 
respective impurity profiles were discussed, demonstrating an understanding on the active substance 
manufacturers part of the chemical properties of each. 
The stereocentre of the  active substance is formed during the synthesis. Two different methods for 
separation of the enantiomers are described, followed by a final purification and micronisation of the 
active substance. The acceptability of this  approach has been discussed at  pre-submission meetings 
with  the EMA and the Rapporteurs prior to submission of the dossier. During validation, 
characterisation of batches made by both procedures were compared, including statistical  evaluation of 
the results. The evaluation shows that  the direct process product finerenone crude is highly pure and 
the statistical  differences that were seen in some cases between the two  processes are at a very low 
impurity levels and thus mainly related to the analytical methods. The batch to  batch variation is in the 
same order as the process to process variation. No new impurities were found, and no change in 
quantitation  of impurities was seen. Batch analysis data provided support that  the two methods indeed 
are equivalent. 
The enantiomeric control has been described, ensuring a complete purge of the R-enantiomer with  the 
mother liquor, regardless the separation method used. The final steps do not affect stereochemistry. 
The presence of the undesired enantiomer (R) is controlled in the specification for the  micronised 
active substance. No interconversion from S to R has been observed, even during forced degradation. 
Following  a Major Objection (MO) raised during  the evaluation, critical process steps were identified 
based on their impact on critical quality attributes  (CQAs). Identity,  appearance and assay are defined 
as CQAs, although they cannot be linked to any specific step, but rather to the overall process design 
and control. 
The following steps are considered critical:  
• 
• 
Enantiomeric separation  
Final crystallisation 
•  Micronisation of the active substance.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting  materials and reagents have been presented.

EMA/78746/2022

The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in  accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with  regards to their origin and characterised. 
All known potential mutagenic impurities in the  active substance were evaluated in silico, using DEREK 
and Leadspace, supplemented by VITIC Nexus experimental data.  
The potential formation of nitrosamines in the active substance was evaluated according to ICH M7. 
The entire manufacturing chain was included – all synthetic steps, including  starting materials, 
reagents, raw materials, reaction conditions, re-use of solvents and active substance chemical 
structure, packaging, and storage conditions. No risks for nitrosamine formation were identified. 
A risk assessment on the potential  presence of elemental impurities was performed according to  ICH 
Q3D. No metal catalysts are used in the  active substance manufacturing. Six batches of the active 
substance were screened for elemental impurities. No elements were found above their respective 
thresholds.  
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with  the 
clinical development programme. The same overall route was used during pre-clinical and clinical 
development. Initially, five process steps were performed under cGMP, but  in the MAA submission 
three additional steps were included in the GMP process as currently described. Changes introduced 
have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified. For all pre-clinical and clinical batches 
up to phase 2, the separation of the enantiomers was achieved by one method; an alternative method 
was introduced at the time of clinical trials phase 3. 
The quality of the active substance used in the various phases of the development is considered to be 
comparable with  that produced by the proposed commercial process. 
Process parameters were evaluated by risk assessment, and those with  potential influence on the 
quality attributes  of micronised active substance were investigated by variation of one parameter at a 
time (OVAT), or, to investigate PARs, by variation multiple parameters simultaneously. PARs have been 
described for each process step. For PARs, the applicant compliance with the  Q&A document 
EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/354895/2017  “Questions and answers: Improving the understanding of NORs, 
PARs, DSp and normal variability of process parameters” has been declared in response to the MO. 
The applicant claims two  design spaces for the manufacturing process. Based on laboratory data from 
process understanding studies, simple design spaces have been defined and justified for non-critical 
process parameters.  
For each proposed design space, the  extremes were tested (data included in the dossier). Furthermore, 
in both  cases no impact from reaction scale is expected as the amounts are calculated based on 
equivalents. No significant effects on output  quality were found. Hence, the proposed design spaces 
are accepted. 
The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from 
commercial scale batches fully support the proposed PARs and design spaces. 
The active substance is packaged in LDPE foil bags. As secondary packaging, tightly closed containers 
for mechanical protection are used. The packaging material complies with Ph. Eur. 3.1.3  Polyolefins, EC 
Directives 1935/2004/EC,  and Commission regulation (EU)  10/2011.

2.4.2.1.  Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance and colour, identity (IR, HPLC),  PSD 
(laser diffraction), enantiomeric purity (RP-HPLC), water content (KF),  residual solvents (HS-GC), 
related substances (RP-HPLC) and assay (RP-HPLC). 
The specification comprises relevant tests  for the intended  use of the active substance.  
The active substance is micronised prior to  use in the  finished product manufacture. Therefore, its 
particle size distribution  is controlled by specification. The limits were set based on experience from 
finished product manufacture, e.g. that  tablets manufactured with  active substance particle size 
outside the specified limits  displayed slower dissolution  at 15 minutes, although  compliance with 
specification at 30 minutes was observed. The proposed limits  are considered adequate with  respect to 
commercial content uniformity and dissolution, as well as comparability with  development batches.  
Enantiomeric purity limit is in  line with  ICH Q3A requirements. 
Limits  for the undesired R enantiomer, organic impurities/related substances, and residual solvents 
have been defined in line with  ICH Q3A and Q3C, respectively, and the levels are acceptable.  
Water is introduced in the crystallisation. It is purged with  the mother liquor and by drying in that step. 
Finerenone is not hygroscopic, water is considered a non-critical attribute,  but  nonetheless it  is 
controlled in the active substance specification with  an acceptable limit. 
Acceptable discussions and justifications  for not  including tests for elemental impurities,  potentially 
mutagenic impurities other than already specified, microbiological purity,  and polymorphic form in the 
active substance specification have been provided. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in  accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards of finerenone micronised and of impurities specified for the  active substance have 
been provided. 
Batch data for 10  commercial scale batches and representing the  different combinations of enantiomer 
separation technique and micronisation site, are presented. All batches comply with current 
specification, and the inter-batch variation is very low. Thereby, the  presented batch data is accepted 
as support for the comparability of active substance manufactured using one of the  two different 
methods for separation of the  enantiomers and being micronised at either site. 
In addition, data from a number of development batches is presented. The analytical methods, and if 
there were any differences between them and those described in S.4.2, have not described or 
discussed. However, the presented results are generally in good agreement with  those presented for 
the commercial batches, which is taken as an indication that  the manufacturing procedure has 
remained consistent and robust over time. 
2.4.2.1.  Stability 
Stability data from 10 commercial validation batches of micronised active substance from the proposed 
manufacturers (five batches were made by each method for enantiomeric separation, and both 
micronisation sites are represented) stored in  the intended commercial package for up to 12  months 
under long term conditions (25ºC / 60%  RH), 12 months at  30 °C/75 % RH and for up to 6 months 
under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH)  according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
Assessment report  
EMA/78746/2022  
Page 17/159 
 
 
 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, identity, PSD, enantiomeric purity, water, specified 
impurities, any unspecified impurity, total  impurities, and assay. The analytical methods used were the 
same as for release and were stability indicating.   
All tested parameters were within  the specifications. Analytical results remained essentially constant 
over the studied periods under all storage conditions. Results were also very similar between batches. 
Additional supportive stability results from the 7  pilot-scale clinical batches stored for up to 24  months 
at 25ºC / 60%  RH and for up  to 12 months at 40ºC  / 75% RH were presented. They showed that  the 
active substance is very stable. There are only minor changes within  those batches, and no clear 
trends in any parameters. Also, there is good agreement in results between batches and between long-
term and accelerated conditions. The applicant states that  all results met the current specifications at 
the time, but  that  most batches also would comply with  the proposed commercial specification, which 
is agreed.  
Photostability tests  following the ICH guideline Q1B were performed in solid and in  solution on a 
commercial scale batch. Based on the results obtained, solid finerenone was classified as not being 
photolabile in the solid state, and consequently no measures to protect it  from light  during handling or 
storage are proposed. In solution,  finerenone should be protected from light  by e.g. suitable 
packaging. 
Results from stress testing under thermal, oxidative and hydrolytic conditions  were also provided. 
Finerenone was found to  be stable to thermal stress, stable to  hydrolysis at neutral or moderately 
alkaline conditions, but  somewhat susceptible to  hydrolysis at higher pH and upon treatment with  acid. 
The active substance is rapidly degraded if exposed to oxidative conditions in  solution.  
The stability results indicate that  the micronised finerenone manufactured by the  proposed suppliers is 
sufficiently stable. The stability  results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months with  no special 
storage instructions  in the proposed container. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the  product and pharmaceutical development 
Kerendia film-coated tablet 10 mg is presented as pink film-coated, oval oblong tablet with  a length of 
10 mm, a width  of 5  mm, a radius of curvature of 3.4  mm, a height  of 3.1 – 3.7 mm and a weight of 
136.00  mg. The tablets are marked with  “10” on the top  side and “FI” on the  bottom side. 
Kerendia film-coated tablet 20 mg is presented as pale-yellow film-coated, oval oblong tablet with  a 
length of 10 mm, a width  of 5 mm, a radius of curvature of 3.4 mm, a height of 3.1 – 3.7  mm and a 
weight  of 136.00  mg. The tablets are marked with  “20” on the  top side and “FI”  on the bottom side. 
The list of excipients is included in section 6.1  of the  SmPC. 
Finerenone tablets are film-coated in order to provide a homogeneous appearance, to add a colour for 
product identification  and to  facilitate swallowing. Commonly used coating excipients with  worldwide 
acceptability have been selected. The coating  is applied as an aqueous coating suspension, containing 
hypromellose 5 cP as film forming agent, talc as anti-tacking  agent and depending on the dose 
strength inorganic pigments to achieve the desired respective colour.  
Assessment report  
EMA/78746/2022

The tablets  have same shape and same weight,  but different colour (10 mg tablets light pink and 20 mg 
tablets  light  yellow)  and  markings.  Based on  the  posology  it  is  likely  that  the  patient  has  only  one 
strength to  handle. The risk for mix-up is considered satisfactorily addressed.  
The tablet cores for the 10 mg and 20 mg strengths have identical qualitative and quantitative 
composition except for the amounts of finerenone, microcrystalline cellulose, lactose monohydrate and 
sodium laurilsulfate.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their  quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards, except the iron oxides used in the tablet-coatings  (Iron oxide red and iron oxide yellow). 
The constituents  of the lacquers comply with  Ph. Eur. or the  EU foodstuffs regulation. There are no 
novel excipients used in  the finished product formulation. The list  of excipients is included in section 
6.1 of the SmPC. 
In the section 4.2. of SmPC it  is reported that  for patients who  are unable to swallow whole tablets, 
Kerendia tablets may be crushed. The film-coating  is not functional and it has been shown that it  does 
not influence the drug dissolution.  The purpose of the coating  is cosmetical and better compliance. 
Thereby it is acceptable to  crush the  tablet.  
The aim of the pharmaceutical development was to provide a safe and effective oral formulation 
containing finerenone micronised that is convenient for patients  and ensures patient compliance 
according to  the Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP). The QTPP describes the properties of the dosage 
form including  route of administration (oral, immediate release tablet, format and colour) as well as the 
requirements which  should be fulfilled to comply with  the specification (identity,  appearance, solid state 
form, assay, uniformity of dosage, degradation products, dissolution and microbial purity).  Additionally, 
a minimum shelf life which  should be achieved in a suitable container closure system, is included.  
All these properties were evaluated and development led to immediate release easy to swallow tablets 
for a variety of strengths, which  meet all ICH-  and Ph.Eur. requirements and showed to be very stable, 
as detailed hereafter. 
Immediate release (IR) tablet formulations of relatively small size were selected as dosage form.  
Compatibility studies of finerenone active substance with  common tablet  excipients, such as cellulose 
microcrystalline, croscarmellose sodium, hypromellose 5 cP, lactose monohydrate, magnesium 
stearate, sodium laurilsulfate, talc, titanium  dioxide and ferric oxides were performed. Binary drug 
excipient mixtures were investigated storing the  mixtures at 40  °C/75 % relative humidity  (RH), open 
storage and at 60  °C. Significant drug excipient incompatibilities  could not be detected.  
Due to  the low solubility of finerenone, micronised substance is used in the tablets, as indicated in the 
active substance section. 
From the QTPP a list  of relevant quality attributes was initially identified.  The criticality of each quality 
attribute  was then evaluated based on its  impact on the  safety and efficacy to a patient if the product 
falls outside the acceptable range of that  quality attribute.  From the criticality analysis the following 
seven quality attributes  (QAs) are defined as critical quality attributes (CQAs) for finerenone coated 
tablet: identity,  appearance, uniformity of dosage, dissolution, degradation products, assay and 
microbial purity. 
The start of Phase I dose finding studies was performed using an oral liquid  formulation of finerenone. 
For clinical trials with  radiolabelled active ingredient an aqueous oral solution or a macrogol-based 
solution was applied. 
Assessment report  
EMA/78746/2022  
Page 19/159 
 
 
 
An intravenous solution  for infusion with  an active substance concentration of 0.005 % has also been 
developed and studied in an absolute bioavailability study for the  evaluation of immediate release 
tablets 5 mg. 
All other clinical trials were performed with immediate release tablet formulations of various dose 
strengths. The different dose strengths needed to supply clinical studies  Phase I-IIa (1.25 mg + 
10 mg), Phase IIb (1.25  mg –  20 mg) and Phase-III (10 mg –  20 mg) were based on the  same 
qualitative core composition and manufacturing process.  
The proposed commercial products are of the  same core composition as the  clinical Phase IIb/III 
formulations.  
Alternative formulations are under development for paediatric use. 
The comparison between the dissolution profiles of the tablets used for clinical studies and those intended 
for  commercial use  was  performed on three  buffers  at  pH  1.2-6.8  and  they  show  comparable in  vitro 
profiles for the two formulations.  
The development of the dissolution method has been described by the applicant. A dissolution limit  of 
Q = 80 % in 30  minutes was set first as a critical quality attribute  and then a method was developed 
to achieve this  limit instead of first developing a discriminative method and then setting  the 
specification limit based on data from clinical batches. Based on the  data provided the applicant was 
requested to  revise the acceptance criteria in line with  the reflection paper 
EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/336031/2017.  The limit  was changed in line with  the reflection paper. This is 
acceptable. 
A standard manufacturing process is proposed for Kerendia film-coated tablets  consisting of fluid-bed 
granulation (including  drying and sieving) followed by post-blending, compression and film-coating. 
During process development and scale up, the impact of manufacturing conditions on the quality 
attributes  of the  final dosage form as defined from the QTPP was investigated. 
The applicant applied QbD principles in  the development of the finished product and their 
manufacturing process. A comprehensive risk analysis was performed using the failure mode effect 
analysis (FMEA)  method to define which functionality  related characteristics of the excipients and which 
critical process steps and process parameters of each manufacturing steps may have an influence on 
the key quality attributes  of the final finished product as derived from the QTPP. According to the risk 
analysis only the film-coating was identified as a critical manufacturing process step. 
A total of 7 potential critical raw material attributes and of 15 potential critical process parameters had 
been identified.  Most of them were further investigated by individual laboratory experiments and for 
process parameters carefully monitored during design of experiments (DoE) studies in laboratory scale 
as well as pilot  and commercial scale. For those not included in further experiments appropriate 
explanation was given. Adequate process control (in-process testing)  and release testing of the 
finished product have been established. 
On the basis of the  knowledge gained from the DoE studies in laboratory and pilot scale it  was decided 
to focus the DoE study in commercial scale on the granulation process (spray rate, spray pressure and 
product temperature) and film coating (spray rate, outlet  air temperature and drum rotation  speed). A 
full 2-level factorial design with  three factors and four centre points was carried out for each of them. 
These experiments have been used to set the parameter ranges for the in-process controls. 
The applicant claimed design space for the granulation and film-coating steps. However, data provided 
was not sufficient to support them.  They were withdrawn  and replaced by acceptable NORs and PARs.

The available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from 
commercial scale batches fully support the proposed PARs. 
The tablets are either packaged in PVC/PVDC/Al transparent calendarised or perforated unit dose blisters 
or HDPE bottles  with opaque polypropylene child-resistant screw cap with sealing insert, as described in 
section 6.5 of the SmPC. The materials comply with Ph.Eur., EU food regulation and/or EC requirements. 
The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is  adequate for the 
intended use of the product.  
2.4.3.1.  Manufacture  of the  product and process controls 
The tablets are manufactured and released by Bayer AG, Germany. The manufacturing process is a 
standard process consisting of mixing, wet  granulation, drying, sieving, blending, tablet  compression 
and film-coating as outlined in Scheme 2. To manufacture the aqueous coating suspension, the 
individual components or a ready-to-use film-coat can be used. 
The manufacturing process has been adequately described. 
Some data derived from pilot  scale batches for 10  and 20  mg tablets to support the proposed holding 
times of intermediate products have been provided. The findings are considered acceptable. The 
applicant has started studies to confirm the proposed holding times on commercial batches. Control of 
assay and impurities will be included in these studies in order to assure that  there is no change of the 
active substance during the holding  times. The CHMP  recommended the applicant to provide the 
confirmatory data from the  on-going holding times study on commercial scale 10 and 20 mg tablets to 
support the proposed holding times of intermediate products (REC). 
It has been confirmed that the start  of shelf-life is calculated in accordance with “Note  for Guidance on 
the start of shelf-life of the finished dosage form”.  
Adequate in-process controls (loss on drying, uniformity of mass, breaking load, disintegration and 
friability) with  limits justified during pharmaceutical development have been described. 
The only critical step is the film-coating  step that is appropriately controlled. 
Process validation has been performed on three production scale batches of each strength.  It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner.  
2.4.3.1.  Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  and  shelf  life  specifications  include:  appearance,  identity  (HPLC/UPLC, 
retention time and UV spectrum), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur), dissolution (Ph. Eur), degradation 
products (HPLC/UPLC  ), assay (HPLC/UPLC), microbial purity, TAMC, TYMC and E. coli (Ph. Eur.).  
The specification includes relevant and appropriate tests  for this  kind of dosage form.  
Rac-Amido-naphthyridine is the only specified degradation product of the  active substance. It is also 
the major metabolite in animals and humans and thus can be considered toxicologically qualified.  
The limits for related substances at both release and shelf-life are in  accordance with ICH Q3B and are 
considered acceptable. All other limits have also been satisfactorily justified.

The potential presence of elemental impurities in the  finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in  line with the  ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data on 
six batches using a validated ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that  each relevant 
elemental impurity  was not  detected above 30%  of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment 
and the presented batch data it  can be concluded that it  is not necessary to include any elemental 
impurity control. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
Following  a MO  raised by the  CHMP, the  applicant presented a risk evaluation concerning the presence 
of nitrosamine impurities  in the finished product considering all suspected and actual root causes in 
line with  the “Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP 
Opinion for the Article 5(3)  of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004  referral on nitrosamine impurities in 
human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020)  and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 
5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004-  Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/369136/2020).  Based on the information presented and the  responses to the questions raised 
with  regards to the presence of nitrocellulose print  primer, printing  inks and over-lacquer on the 
outside of the lidding foil of the blisters, it  is accepted that no risk was identified  on the possible 
presence of nitrosamine impurities in the  active substance or the  related finished product, since neither 
the foil nor the printing  ink contain  any components with  known amine groups. Therefore, no 
additional control measures are deemed necessary on the proposed product. The applicant is reminded 
that  future changes to materials or supplier of any material need to be reassessed regarding the risk of 
nitrosamines presence in the  product and that  the MAH  is responsible for the  evaluation and 
conclusions regarding presence of nitrosamine impurities in their products. 
Acceptable justifications for the omission of tests  for enantiomeric purity, residual solvents, water 
content,  tablet breaking load and disintegration  were also provided. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the  ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing  has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided from three pilot  scale batches of each strength confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to  manufacture to the  intended product 
specification.  
Furthermore batch analysis data from clinical batches and additional data from batches using active 
substance manufactured with  each of the applied enantiomer separation methods followed by 
micronisation at the relevant sites were provided. No differences were observed. 
2.4.3.1.  Stability of the product 
Stability data from six pilot  scale batches of finished product (three batches per strength) stored for up 
to 24 months  under long term conditions (25ºC  / 60% RH and 30ºC  / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months 
under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH)  according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The 
batches of Kerendia are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary 
packagings proposed for marketing (i.e. both blister and bottles).   
The  stability  study  samples  were tested  for  appearance, assay, degradation  products,  dissolution  and 
microbial purity.  The analytical procedures used are stability  indicating. 
All results were within the specification limits and no trends were seen. The tablets are very stable. There 
are no differences between the results for tablets stored in blister or bottle.

Additional  stability  data  on  10  mg  and  20  mg  tablet  batches  which  were  manufactured  using  active 
substance  with  each  of  the  applied  enantiomer  separation methods  followed  by  micronisation  at  the 
relevant sites were provided. All were stable under normal and accelerated conditions. 
Bulk stability studies were conducted in long-term conditions  of 25°C/60 % RH and 30°C/75 % RH for 
two finished product batches of each strength  covering a storage period of up to 12 months.  The 
tablets were packed in PE bags in a tightly  closed tin  cans. The specified degradation product rac-
amido-naphthyridine showed a slight  increase during storage but the  results are well-within  the 
specification limit. All other tested parameters are stable under the  tested conditions and show no 
discernible trend during storage. The bulk stability  data confirmed that  the tablets are stable for 12 
months when stored in PE bags in tightly closed tin cans. 
The  tablets  complied  with  the  specification  also  after  stress  storage  at  80°C  for  3  months,  open  air 
storage at 45°C  for 3 months  after light  exposure. 
Photostability studies were performed on three commercial scale batches from each tablet strength in 
accordance with the  requirements of the  ICH guideline Q1B, "Photo stability  Testing of New Drug 
Substances and Products". Samples were tested  for appearance, assay, degradation products and 
dissolution. The analytical procedures used are stability  indicating. All results of the directly exposed 
samples met the acceptance criteria and no differences to the unexposed samples were observed. 
Based on the data obtained, the tablets are stable upon  exposure to light.  No light  protection is 
required. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 3 years and with  no special precautions for 
storage as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3 and 6.4) are acceptable. The tablets  are very stable and no 
in-use shelf-life is necessary for opened bottles. The proposed bulk storage for 12  months is also 
acceptable. 
2.4.3.1.  Adventitious agents 
Magnesium stearate is of vegetable origin.  
It is confirmed that  the lactose monohydrate is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same 
condition as those used to  collect milk for human consumption and that the  lactose has been prepared 
without  the use of ruminant material other than  calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on 
Minimising  the Risk of Transmitting  Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human  and 
veterinary medicinal products. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. Two Major Objections (MO) were raised during the evaluation 
relating to absence of critical steps in the active substance manufacturing process and nitrosamines 
risk assessment in  the finished product. In response, critical steps in the  active substance 
manufacturing process were identified based on their impact on critical quality attributes (CQAs) and 
the applicant presented a risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the 
finished product considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with EMA  guidelines. Both MOs 
were considered to  be resolved. 
The results of tests  carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn  lead to the conclusion that  the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. The applicant has applied QbD principles in the  development of the

active substance and the finished product and their manufacturing process. The two design spaces 
claimed in  the active substance synthesis are accepted.  
At the time of the CHMP  opinion, there was minor unresolved quality issue having no impact on the 
Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertain to  the confirmation of the holding  times for the 
manufacture of the tablets  on commercial batches. This point  is put forward and agreed as 
recommendation for future quality development. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs  to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP  recommends the following points for investigation: 
The applicant is recommended to provide the confirmatory data from the on-going holding  times study 
on commercial scale 10 and 20 mg tablets to  support the proposed holding times of intermediate 
products. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is expressed in many tissues including the  kidneys, heart and 
blood vessels. The receptor is activated by mineralocorticoids such as aldosterone as well as 
glucocorticosteroids like cortisol. Chronic overactivation of the MR, has been demonstrated in chronic 
pathophysiological states, where it contributes  to organ damage and dysfunction in heart failure, 
myocardial infarction, chronic kidney disease and hypertension. Finerenone is a nonsteroidal antagonist 
of the MR and it  can thereby attenuate the inflammation and fibrosis mediated by the overactivation of 
the MR. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Primary pharmacodynamics in vitro 
The pharmacological in vitro characterisation of finerenone was conducted in a series of experiments. A 
cell-based transactivation assay using the ligand binding  domains of human mineralocorticoid, 
androgen, progesterone and oestrogen receptors were used to compare finerenone with  the other MR 
antagonists spironolactone and eplerenone. Finerenone had an IC50 of 17 nM  in the MR,  but no activity 
up to 10  µM in the  other steroid hormone receptors. Spironolactone had similar activity on the MR 
(IC50 of 28 nM),  and also activity in the other receptors (IC50 GR-2430 nM,  AR-160 nM,  PR-1500 nM, 
ERα – 5970  nM, ERβ – 4940  nM). 
Assessment report  
EMA/78746/2022  
Page 24/159 
 
 
 
Similar results were obtained when  using ligand binding domains of rat and dog MR in the  cell-based 
transactivation assay. No information was presented on the binding  of finerenone to  the MR in mouse 
or rabbit. No data or discussion on the binding  capacity of finerenone towards other steroid hormone 
receptors in the common experimental animals was presented.  
Experiments with  the full-length  MR and radioactive binding  assays confirmed finerenone to be a 
potent antagonist.   
No agonistic activity of BAY 94-8862  at any of the  tested human steroid hormone receptors (up to 10 
µM)  was observed. 
In an experiment with  MR and the agonists aldosterone, cortisol, corticosterone and DOCA, the 
blocking with BAY 94-8862  was more potent than  spironolactone and eplerenone, as demonstrated 
with  lower IC50 values. 
The cell-based transactivation assay using the ligand binding domains of human mineralocorticoid 
receptor was also used to characterize 6 atropisomers of the human plasma metabolites of finerenone 
(M-1a,  M-1b, M-2a,  M-2b,  M-3a, and M-3b).  No activity up to  9 µM of the atropisomers was detected. 
The in vitro characterisation of finerenone was further characterised and the x-ray structure of the wild 
typ MR presented. The gain-of-function  S810L MR mutant  is said to be the cause for early-onset 
hypertension in  men and gestational hypertension in women. In a functional cell-based in vitro 
experiment finerenone was capable of inhibiting  aldosterone induced activity. 
Primary pharmacodynamics in vivo 
Finerenone has been evaluated in several in vivo models covering different aspects of cardiorenal 
disease. The presented studies were conducted by the applicant, but  several studies were submitted as 
scientific publications. The models included genetical, surgical and chemically induced disease in mice, 
rats and dogs.  
Finerenone induced natriuresis in conscious rats at  0.3 mg/kg after a single dose administration. The 
urinary Na+/K+  ratio was also increased after a single dose in conscious dogs. The dogs had been 
pretreated with  a metabolically stable aldosterone analogue. The increase in Na+/K+  ratio was 
observed at doses from 10  µg/kg.  
The protective effects of finerenone were investigated in the DOCA-salt model in rat. 
Desoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) is a potent MR  agonist and when uninephrectomised rats on 1% 
NaCl drinking water are administered DOCA once weekly for 10  weeks, they end up with heart failure 
and severe end organ damages. In the  study, urine was collected and blood pressure measured 
weekly. At the end of the experiment, haemodynamics and histopathology was evaluated. Finerenone 
was administered at 0.1,  1 and 10 mg/kg once daily. Finerenone showed pronounced end-organ 
protection of heart and kidneys by a dose-dependent decrease in blood pressure, plasma prohormone 
of brain natriuretic  peptide (proBNP), proteinuria, cardiac and renal hypertrophy. The renal expression 
of several pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic biomarker genes was also reduced. The histopathological 
analysis of heart and kidney lesions, showed antifibrotic activity of finerenone. 
The effect of finerenone in a model of myocardial infarction was investigated in rat. Finerenone 
treatment started one week after surgery were the left anterior descending coronary artery was 
permanently ligated. Several of the haemodynamic parameters were improved by finerenone, however 
not statistically  significant. 
The effect of finerenone 10 mg/kg once daily for 45 days was investigated in the stroke prone 
spontaneous hypertensive model in rat. The model is a high renin model of hypertension-induced end-
organ damages. Morbidity and mortality are increased due to renal, myocardial and cerebrovascular 
Assessment report

lesions. Before start of treatment  the animals were pretreated with  high salt diet for 7 weeks. 
Finerenone showed protection from morbidity and mortality.  Administration of finerenone also reduced 
protein excretion and pro-fibrotic markers (OPN, TIMP1,  and PAI-1) in serum and urine. The 
semiquantitative histopathological analysis of the heart (vasculopathies, focal myocardial degeneration 
and fibrosis) and kidney lesions (tubular degeneration and atrophy of adipose tissue in kidneys), 
revealed significant improvement with  finerenone. 
The protective effects of finerenone was also evaluated in a cardiac hypertrophy model and a cardiac 
fibrosis model in mice. Cardiac hypertrophy is induced by a surgical intervention in which transverse 
aortic constriction is induced causing a left ventricular pressure overload. Treatment with  finerenone in 
this model significantly lowered the  left ventricular mass compared with  vehicle treated animals. In the 
cardiac fibrosis model, fibrosis is induced by a isoproterenol injection. Pretreatment with  finerenone 
blocked the induced cardiac fibrosis and macrophage invasion. 
In a rat model of type-2 diabetes mellitus,  administration of finerenone reduced left ventricular end-
diastolic pressure. A decrease in proteinuria and renal neutrophil gelatinase associated to lipocalin 
(NGAL) expression was also observed. 
The effects of pretreatment with finerenone in an ischemia/reperfusion induced kidney injury model in 
mice and rats were investigated. In mice, the analysis was done 4 weeks after the  I/R. Increases by 
I/R in plasma creatinine, plasma urea and TGF-beta expression were prevented by finerenone.  
In the I/R study in rats, effects were analysed both acutely (24  h after I/R, AKI) and as chronic kidney 
disease (4 months,  CKD). Finerenone 10 mg/kg was administered before the ischemia. In the AKI 
setting,  pretreatment with  finerenone blunted  increases of plasma creatinine and urea. In the 
finerenone treated animals the  presence of tubular lesions and infiltrates of macrophages were reduced 
in comparison with  vehicle treated AKI animals. In the animals 4 months  after the  I/R induction,  renal 
dysfunction and modified renal haemodynamics were observed. These effects were not  observed in the 
animals pretreated with  finerenone.  
A study was conducted in  a genetic CKD model in rat. The rats develops spontaneously albuminuria 
and exhibits endothelial dysfunction associated to low NO availability. In this study, animals were 
administered finerenone 10 mg/kg for 4 weeks. The treatment lowered albuminuria and reduced 
systolic blood pressure. 
Overall, administration of finerenone in the different studies resulted in MR-antagonising  effects with  a 
beneficial/ protective effect on heart and kidneys in rodents.  
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Finerenone and its  major human plasma metabolites were assessed for its off-target activity in 
screening assays (65-67  receptors, transporters and ion channels). These radioligand binding assays 
included mostly human off-targets from various (neuro)transmitter systems e.g. adenosine (A1, A2A, 
A3), adrenergic (α1a, α1b, α1d, α2a, β1, β2,  NET), cannabinoid (CB1), dopamine (D1, D2s, D3, D4.4, 
DAT), GABA (A, B1A, GABA-T), glutamate (kainate, NMDA, glycine), histamine (H1, H2,  H3), 
muscarinergic (M1,  M2, M3),  opioid (δ1, κ, μ), serotoninergic (5-HT1a,  5-HT2b,  5-HT3,  SERT). There 
were no interactions at 10  µM in  any of these assays. 
Finerenone and the  selectivity on the mineralocorticoid receptor vs other steroid hormone receptors 
was also investigated. The results are presented primarily in  the primary pharmacodynamic section. 
Finerenone and the  major metabolites were also investigated in in  vitro patch clamp studies assessing 
different human cardiac ion channels. These experiments did not show interference with  cardiac ion

channels in vitro including  the hERG K+ current, the hNav1.5 Na+ current, and the hCav1.2 Ca2+ 
current. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety  pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology studies addressed the impact of finerenone on vital organ functions (CNS, 
cardiovascular system including ECG, respiratory system).  
Cardiovascular 
Voltage clamp studies were conducted in  human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells transfected with  hERG. 
The hERG IC50 was 86 µmol/L  (33 mg/L),  which is approximately 200 times the total  clinical Cmax 
(161  µg/L), and 2400  times the free fraction (Cmax, unbound 13.4  µg/L;  fu 8.3%). The human 
metabolites M-1a, M-2a  or M-3a  did not inhibit  the hERG potassium channel current at  the tested 
concentrations. 
ECG was analysed in conscious dogs after a single oral dose. No effects of finerenone was observed on 
QRS complex duration and on QT/QTc intervals. PQ intervals were shortened by 5-10 %.  The effect 
continued for several hours. The clinical relevance is not known. The maximum dose tested in the 
study (10 mg/kg) corresponds to a Cmax of 13.9 mg/L,  which is approximately 86 times the clinical 
Cmax (161  µg/L). The Cmax unbound  at 10 mg/kg was 764.5  µg/L,  which corresponds to 57 times the 
free fraction (Cmax, unbound  13.4 µg/L;  fu 8.3%). 
According to the  SmPC, a dedicated QT study in 57 healthy participants has been conducted. There 
was no indication of a QT/QTc prolonging effect of finerenone after single doses of 20 mg (therapeutic) 
or 80 mg (supratherapeutic).  
Respiratory 
An in vivo study in rats were conducted to  investigate the  effect of finerenone on respiratory function. 
No effects were observed on respiration rate, tidal volume or minute volume. 
Systemic exposure was not measured in Sprague Dawley rats after a single dose. However, the same 
maximum dose (30 mg/kg), resulted in a total Cmax of 94.5 mg/L  in Wistar rats, which is 587 times 
the Cmax observed in patients (161  µg/L).  If comparing the unbound Cmax values, the rat Cmax 
unbound was 44.4  µg/L, to be compared with  the human Cmax, unbound  of 13.4  µg/L, which  renders 
an exposure margin of 3. Thus, based on the  total exposure it is reasonable to conclude that  the 
exposure margin in the  SD rat is sufficiently high to conclude that no effects on respiratory function 
can be expected in  humans. When comparing the unbound fractions the exposure margin is 
significantly lower. There are however no indications from the clinical trials of any adverse effects on 
respiratory function.  
CNS 
No behavioural or physiological changes were observed after a single dose of finerenone in  male rats. 
No interference with  phentylenetetrazole induced convulsions as a model of pro- or anticonvulsive 
activity was observed after administration of finerenone. Furthermore, no impairment of 
motorcoordination was observed in a RotaRod experiment. 
Systemic exposure was measured in satellite animals. The highest dose tested in the modified Irwin 
study (30 mg/kg), resulted in a Cmax of 94.5 mg/L,  which is 587 times the Cmax observed in patients 
(161  µg/L). If comparing the unbound  Cmax values, the rat Cmax unbound  was 44.4 µg/L,  to be 
compared with  the human Cmax, unbound of 13.4  µg/L, which  renders an exposure margin of 3. 
Assessment report

Thus, based on the total  exposure it is reasonable to conclude that  the exposure margin in the SD rat 
is sufficiently high to conclude that  no behavioural or physiological changes can be expected in 
humans. When comparing the  unbound fractions the  exposure margin is significantly lower. There are 
however no indications from the clinical trials of any adverse effects on CNS. 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No non-clinical pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were performed which is considered 
acceptable. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics of finerenone was investigated in vivo after single administration in CD 1 mouse, 
Wistar rat, Beagle dog and Cynomolgus monkey. In addition, in vitro studies were performed to 
investigate permeability in Caco-2 cells, plasma protein binding, blood cell/plasma partitioning  and 
drug metabolism in  several species (mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, monkey, and human). Drug-drug 
interaction potential  in terms of various metabolizing enzymes and transporters were also analysed 
and is evaluated as part of the clinical assessment. Pharmacokinetics after repeated administration 
were performed as part of the  toxicology studies. 
Finerenone contains one asymmetric carbon atom, and the  drug is the  pure S-enantiomer. The 
potential for racemisation/conversion of the S-enantiomer to  its pharmacologically inactive R-
enantiomer under in vivo conditions  has been performed in humans, no racemisation in human plasma 
was seen. In addition, the  predominant human plasma metabolites of finerenone M-1,  M-2,  and M-3 
exhibit axial chirality forming the atropisomers M-1a,  M-1b, M-2a,  M-2b,  M-3a, and M-3b,  respectively 
and analysis of the atropisomer ratios of M-1,  M-2,  and M-3  in human plasma and plasma from rats 
and dogs (used in the  toxicological studies) have been performed. No conversion of the  atropisomers 
was seen in vitro. 
Analytical methods 
Different achiral LC MS/MS assays were developed and validated for the determination of finerenone 
and its predominant metabolites in plasma of mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, monkey and human. When 
[14C]-finerenone or radiolabeled metabolised were used, radioactivity concentration in body fluids, 
organs and tissues, and in excreta was determined by liquid scintillation  counting  (LSC). For 
quantitative  whole-body autoradiography (QWBA) studies a phosphor imaging method 
(radioluminography) was used to determine radioactivity concentrations in  tissues. The methods used 
are considered adequate. 
Absorption 
In vitro permeability of finerenone was investigated using Caco-2 cell monolayers and finerenone was 
shown to be highly permeable. Efflux with ratios of 2.3 (2 µM)  to 0.9  (210 µM)  was observed indicating 
active transport of finerenone (see “Pharmacokinetic drug interactions”  evaluated in the Clinical PK 
AR). 
Absorption of total  radioactivity from the gastrointestinal tract  was high  or complete in rats and 
bioavailability of finerenone was high (83  to 120%).  In dogs, bioavailability of finerenone was between 
57% and 100%.  However, the higher bioavailability was determined in dogs after oral administration 
of 3 mg/kg finerenone which exceeded the linear range of pharmacokinetics. In dogs, the 
pharmacokinetics were dose-proportional up to  0.3 mg/kg after po administration of finerenone and in 
the dose range from 0.3  to 3 mg/kg AUC and Cmax increased more than dose-proportionally. In male 
Assessment report  
EMA/78746/2022

rats the pharmacokinetics of finerenone were almost linear within  the  investigated dose range after iv 
(0.3 and 1 mg/kg) and po (0.3 to  3 mg/kg) administration.  Bioavailability in humans was ~44%. 
Plasma clearance was very low in  mice (0.0062  L/(kg·h))  and rats (0.011-0.014  L/(kg·h)), and low in 
dogs (0.16 L/(kg·h))  and monkeys (0.39 L/(kg·h)).  Volume of distribution was low in  mice (0.10  L/kg) 
and rats (0.11-0.14  L/kg), and moderate in dogs (0.39  L/kg) and monkeys (0.25  L/kg). In humans Vss 
of finerenone was approximately 0.65 to 0.87  L/kg (~similar to  total body water), indicating low tissue 
binding. 
The terminal elimination half-life of finerenone from plasma was long in mice with  12 h (interval up to 
72 h) after iv administration. In rats, long half-lives with  8.1 to  8.6 h (iv) and 7.8 to 9.1  h (po) were 
calculated in the interval up to 72 h. In contrast, the corresponding terminal half-lives were short with 
approximately 1.7 h (iv) and 1.5 to 2.4  h (po) in dogs (interval up to  32 h) and 1.3 h (iv) in monkeys 
(interval up to 10 h). 
A higher exposure of up to 8-9-fold was determined in female rats compared to male rats within  the 
repeated dose studies (possibly due to generally lower activity of the cytochrome P450 system of the 
female rat liver). 
Plasma protein binding and blood cell/plasma partitioning 
Plasma protein binding of finerenone was high in  rodents (rat fu 0.05%  and mouse fu 0.1%)  and rabbit 
(fu 0.2%),  whereas moderate protein binding was determined in most non-rodent species (monkey fu 
~3%,  dog fu 6%  and human fu 8%).  The major binding protein fraction of finerenone in human 
plasma was shown to be albumin with  lower binding to α1-acidic glycoprotein, LDL and γ-globulins. 
Saturation of plasma protein binding was seen at high and not clinically relevant concentrations. The 
large species difference in the  free fraction in  plasma, with  higher levels in humans, suggests that fu 
should be considered when exposure margins are calculated. 
Plasma protein binding and blood to plasma concentration ratio were also determined in vitro for the 
major human metabolites M-1a,  M-1b, M-2a,  and M-3a. Species differences were less pronounced 
compared to finerenone. For human, rat, dog, rabbit and mouse unbound fractions of metabolites M-
1a/M-1b  were 5.8/3.9,  6.0/11,  11/6.4,  2.1/1.3  and 15/12%,  respectively. For the metabolite M-2a  the 
unbound fractions ranged between ~38  to 58% in rabbit, rat,  dog and mouse while a somewhat lower 
unbound fraction was seen in human plasma (17%). The unbound fractions of M-3a were between ~68 
and 82% across all tested species. 
Finerenone was mainly distributed to  plasma in whole blood with  blood-to-plasma ratios of 0.55 and 
0.72  for rat and dog, respectively and a ratio of 0.94  seen in human whole blood at clinically relevant 
concentrations. Metabolites M-1a,  M-2a and M-3a were also mainly distributed to  plasma in whole 
blood of rat, dog and human 
Organ and tissue distribution 
Organ and tissue distribution  were studied by quantitative  whole-body autoradiography after 
administration of a single dose of [14C]-finerenone to male and female albino rats (Wistar)  and male 
pigmented rats (Long Evans), as well as pregnant albino rats (Wistar,  Day 18 of gestation). 
Maximum concentrations (Ceq,max) of radioactivity were reached in most organs and tissues at 1 h 
post-dosing (tmax). Highest  concentrations were found in blood followed by lung, liver, kidney papilla 
and adrenal medulla. High radioactivity concentration was also present in the interstitial  spaces 
throughout  the whole animal body. Highest  exposure in terms of AUC was determined in the bile duct 
and gastrointestinal tract contents  indicating biliary/faecal excretion of [14C]-finerenone radioactivity. 
The AUC(0-24) was high in blood as well as in  well perfused organs and tissues, such as liver, lungs, 
kidney papilla and adrenal medulla. The AUC and the radioactivity concentrations in  brain were less 
than 2%  of those in blood. Which might  rather reflect the radioactivity in residual blood, than

penetration across the blood/brain barrier. Similar distribution  patterns were seen after oral and iv 
administration and between male and female rats. Female rats had a ~2-fold higher concentration in 
organs and tissues at 2 h and residual concentrations after 24 h between 9-fold (liver) and 27-fold 
(adrenal medulla) higher than in males (blood 17-fold higher). This suggests a significantly slower 
elimination of radioactivity in  female rats. 
No irreversible binding or retention  was indicated.  At 7 days post-oral administration, residual 
radioactivity in  the animal body (excluding gastrointestinal tract) amounted to less than 0.1%  of the 
administered dose. Similar results were obtained in  pigmented Long Evans rats and there was no 
indication of any specific affinity of substance-associated radioactivity to melanin bearing tissues such 
as eye wall or skin. 
Organ and tissue distribution  in pregnant rats  
The maximum radioactivity concentrations were reached at 4 h post-dose in  most maternal organs, 
tissues and blood. Later maximum concentrations were observed, i.e., after 8 h in  skin and 
submandibulary glands and after 24 h in kidney cortex. In all foetal organs and tissues, increasing 
concentrations were observed between 8  and 48  hours. 49%  of the dose was still available 
systemically at 48h (last  time point analyzed). Even though  the maximum concentration in maternal 
blood was seen at 4h, the  level at 48h was still  4.5 times higher compared to the level seen in foetal 
blood. 
Based on maximum concentrations, the highest  systemic exposure occurred in maternal blood and 
placenta. All investigated maternal and foetal organs showed lower maximum levels than maternal 
blood. The average foetal concentration was about 14-fold  lower than  the maternal blood 
concentration. The highest exposure was detected for foetal blood, skeletal muscles and skin. The 
AUC(0-tn)  ratios for the average foetus exposure/maternal blood and foetal blood/maternal blood were 
0.088  and 0.13,  respectively. The estimated terminal elimination half-lives were between 25h (ovaries, 
maternal skin) and 59h  (maternal skeletal muscles). Due to  terminally increasing concentrations in 
foetal organs and tissues calculation of elimination  half-lives was not applicable. After 24h and 48h,  49 
to 48.6%  of the dose was still systemically available, mainly located in maternal blood and 1.6 and 
2.1% of the dose was located in foetuses.  
Metabolism 
Two major biotransformation pathways were identified: (a) oxidation of the  dihydronaphthyridine to 
the naphthyridine derivative M-1  followed by hydroxylation leading to the hydroxymethyl naphthyridine 
metabolite M-2  with subsequent oxidation leading to the carboxylic acid M-3;  (b) a presumably 
intermediate epoxidation with  subsequent hydrolysis leading to the dihydrodiol M-4  and further 
hydroxylation giving M-5.  Hydroxylated metabolite M-7 was also formed in most species. No significant 
species differences were observed. The same biotransformation pathways were found in  both liver 
microsomes and hepatocytes from rat, dog, monkey, and human, with  the predominant naphthyridine 
oxidation pathway (M-1/M-2/M-3)  favoured over the dihydrodiol pathway (M-4/M-5)  in  all species 
investigated. 
Following  oral administration of [14C]-finerenone, parent compound was by far the major component 
in mouse and rat plasma (>96% of total  radioactivity AUC) with  3 minor metabolites (M-1,  M-4,  and 
M-7)  present in  plasma of these species. In dog and human, finerenone accounted for 28%  and 7.1%, 
respectively, of total  radioactivity AUC. In human plasma, the  naphthyridine metabolites M-1,  M-2,  and 
M-3  were the predominant metabolites covering 49%, 22%,  and 9.0% of total radioactivity AUC. The 
dihydrodiol metabolites M-4  and M-5  were present in  plasma only to minor amounts (<3% of total 
radioactivity AUC). Similar total levels of excreted dihydrodiol derivatives were seen across species 
(sum of M-4,  M-5, M-8:  rat, 17%;  dog, 17%; human, 22% of the administered dose). Considering the 
similar excretion levels and low human plasma levels, the possible formation of an epoxide 
Assessment report

intermediate during the formation of M-4  and M-5  is not considered to be of any concern. No  additional 
studies are thought  to be needed. 
Finerenone is administered as a pure S-enantiomer and only this isomer was found in human plasma, 
i.e. there was no racemisation. Detailed investigations revealed that the predominant human plasma 
metabolites M-1,  M-2, and M-3  exhibited axial chirality forming the atropisomers M-1a, M-1b,  M-2a, M-
2b, M-3a  and M-3b, respectively and the predominant appearance of one atropisomer (a-series, 
>80%)  of each metabolite across all species. Based on human mass balance study and data from 
renally impaired patients, metabolites M-1a, M-1b,  M-2a,  and M-3a  (M-3a  identified in renally impaired 
patients) were concluded to  be major human plasma metabolites (accounting for >10%  of AUC of total 
drug related components). This is agreed. 
Excretion 
Finerenone was mainly excreted via the biliary/fecal route in rats (20%  in urine and 75.7%  in feces). 
While similar levels of excretion into urine and feces were seen in  dogs (53%/42%)  and mainly urinary 
exretion was seen in  humans (80%/21%). 
Finerenone derived radioactivity were excreted into  milk of lactating  rats and ~20%  of the  dose was 
found in milk within  the observation period up to 48 h after administration. 
Nonclinical pharmacokinetics is considered sufficiently characterised and show that  the toxicological 
species used are acceptable and relevant to use. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
The applicant has developed finerenone, selective non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) 
antagonist indicated for the treatment of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in  adults. The maximum 
recommended human dose (MRHD)  for treatment of kidney disease is 20 mg once daily by the oral 
route. A full programme of toxicity studies has been performed to evaluate the toxicity profile of the 
substance. The programme was comprised of general toxicology studies and studies of genotoxicity, 
carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity and phototoxicity. The study programme also included three 
studies in juvenile animals (one single-dose TK study, one systemic toxicity study and one juvenile 
toxicity study focused on female fertility).  While these studies have been included and assessed in this 
assessment report, they are outside the scope of the present application. 
The oral route (oral gavage) has been used throughout  the study programme, as this route is the 
intended clinical route. According to the  applicant, the carcinogenicity studies were originally planned 
with  administration in the diet.  Therefore, studies in  rats and mice using this route of administration 
have been included in the Application. As it became clear during course of the 13-week studies in mice 
and rats that the  toxicokinetic profile did not match the human kinetic profile, the studies were 
discontinued and the diet exposure plans were not  pursued further. Therefore, the studies using oral 
exposure via diet have not  been included in this  assessment report. Even so, general toxicity studies 
using oral gavage exposure are available for mouse, rat and dog, where rat and dog are considered 
main general toxicology species and have been used for studies of up to 26- and 39-weeks duration 
respectively. Both species are considered pharmacologically relevant based on appropriate binding data 
and formation of metabolites. However, as pointed out  in the pharmacology section, no binding-data  is 
available for the  rabbit (used in  the EFD-study) why the pharmacological relevance of the rabbit  is 
currently unclear. 
The vehicle varied across the study programme, with  different vehicles used in mouse-, rat- and dog 
studies. While the reason for this has not been discussed in the  overview documents, the vehicles used 
have overall been well-tolerated (except perhaps in the FEED  study where extensive salivation was

noted). Finerenone is metabolised to give metabolites M-1, M-2  and M-3.  These metabolites exhibited 
axial chirality forming the atropisomers M-1a, M-1b,  M-2a,  M-2b,  M-3a and M-3b  of which  the a-
atropisomers seems dominant across all species. 4 major human metabolites were identified, M-1a, M-
1b, M-2a  and M-3a. They were all sufficiently covered in the rat, why further metabolite-studies have 
not been performed. 
The toxicity profile of finerenone is mostly reflective of the  aldosterone inhibitory pharmacological 
action of the substance, with  effects mainly on the  on water and electrolyte balance and adaptive 
findings in adrenals. However, adverse toxicities have been identified in the  programme, and issues 
have been identified below which should be further discussed by the applicant. 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
A single-dose toxicity study in mouse and rat was performed with  finerenone in which LD50-cut-offs 
and MNLDs were generated. It is strongly stressed that  these study endpoints have no regulatory value 
and such studies should not be performed for animal welfare reasons. Further, relevant single-dose 
data can be generated within  repeated-dose toxicity studies. Based on the data provided, the  rat 
seems more sensitive than the mouse as the oral MNLDs  differ by a factor of 40. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat  dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies have been performed in rat and dog using oral (gavage) administration. 
In the rat studies, the Wistar HsdCpb:WU  strain was used. However, for the  26-week study the strain 
was changed to  HsdRCCHan:Wist. While the  underlying reason for this change is unclear, the change is 
not considered to be of importance for the study evaluations. Doses between 0.5  and 30mg/kg/day 
were used in the rat. As exposures were higher in female rats than in males, female rats were treated 
at lower dose levels than  males in the 26-week study to get similar exposure across sexes. Recovery 
animals were only included in the 4-week study.  In the  dog, doses up to 15mg/kg/day were used, and 
recovery animals were only included in  the 4-week study. Finally,  to support dose-selection in the 
carcinogenicity study, studies of up to 13-weeks were also performed in mice (in accordance with  ICH 
S1C). 
Mortality 
No mortalities were noted in the mouse or dog studies. In the rat, three females died in  the 4-week 
study none of which  was considered treatment related. Two died from gavage error, and one from 
sampling procedures. In the  13-week study, no data on mortalities had been disclosed except for a 
comment that no effects were noted on survival. However, according to the study data animals died 
during the study. Therefore, the applicant was asked to provide with  data on animals found dead and 
euthanised during the study, including  clinical signs and necropsy findings supporting  reasons for their 
deaths. In the response, the applicant explained that  no deaths occurred, and that aspects of the 
documentation system may have caused a misunderstanding. The provided explanation was 
reasonable, and the issue was thus  considered resolved. In the 26-week study, one female at 
15mg/kg/day) was sacrificed on SD 96. The animal showed poor general condition, bloody nose, 
paleness and piloerection prior to death. No cause of death could be established at  histopathological 
examinations. In the absence of similar clinical signs in  surviving animals, it was concluded that  the 
treatment did not  affect the survival of the animals. This is agreed. 
Clinical signs and body weights 
Assessment report  
EMA/78746/2022  
Page 32/159 
 
 
 
 
Clinical signs which appeared repeatedly in the studies include soft/mushy faeces, paleness and 
piloerection. The signs were noted already from 5 mg/kg/day in the  rat, whereas higher exposures 
(30mg/kg/day) decreased motility, sunken flanks and skinny appearance were noted. The clinical signs 
are overall considered signs of general toxicity.  
Reduced body weights were noted across all species used in the general toxicity studies.  However, in 
the mouse, body weights  were fluctuating  in the 13-week study without  clear dose-response.  It should 
be noted that the  dosing in  the mouse study was aiming at supporting a carcinogenicity study based 
on a clinical exposure of 10mg, why the doses used in the  study were generally lower. In the  rat, 
reduced bodyweights were noted from 5mg/kg/day in females and 10mg/kg/day in males. In the 13-
week-study, females body weight gains were severely reduced at 30mg/kg/day reaching an MTD. 
Correlation with  food-consumption was seen in some studies. In the  dog, effects on bodyweight were 
noted from 15mg/kg/day in the 4-week study with  correlating effects on food consumption. No  effects 
were noted on body weight in the  chronic studies.  
Water and electrolyte balance 
In line with  the pharmacological action of finerenone as an aldosterone antagonist, effects on water 
and electrolytes were seen across the studies in rat. Overall, increased urination and water intake was 
seen, with  increases in K/Na ratio. In the dog, small or no effects were reported. In the 13-week study, 
only minimal electrolyte changes were noted at 10mg/kg/day. It  is to  this end surprising that so mild 
effects on pharmacology-related parameters are noted considering the relatively high exposure 
margins achieved. 
Liver 
Liver effects (mild) were seen in the mouse 4-week study and rat 4- and 13-week studies. They were 
mostly periportally or diffusely condensed hepatocytes (minimal-moderate) with  reduced fat deposits 
and correlated with  increased liver weights in the 13-week rat study. In the mouse, cobble-stone 
shaped cells without  cell-cell adhesion was noted, but  at very high exposure (150mg/kg/day) , The 
findings recovered in the  rat 4-week study which was the only rat study with  recovery animals. 
Importantly, no liver findings were seen in the 26-week rat study, in dog or in the cancer studies 
suggesting adaptive findings in the rat and related to  high exposure in the mouse 4-week study. 
Adrenals 
As a consequence of the mineralocorticoid receptor blockade MoA of finerenone, a compensatory 
hypertrophy of the zona glomerulosa (the site of aldosterone synthesis in  the adrenal cortex) was 
prominently seen in all species (graded minimal-extensive) from the lowest doses. In the 4-week study 
in rats, vacuoles in the zona fasciculata are reported only in  the recovery animals. It was unclear what 
these vacuoles are composed of, and the  applicant is asked to clarify the intracellular accumulation and 
deposition that  resulted in the  vacuoles and reflect on the clinical relevance of the vacuoles. In the 
response, the applicant described that  fat droplets in stained FFPE  sections of adrenocortical cells 
appear as round and empty vacuoles of variable size without  any signs of degeneration like 
intravacuolar eosinophilic material. Therefore, based on the described morphology of the discussed 
findings in the  report, the vacuoles are by the applicant considered composed of lipids. Further,  the 
applicant suggests that  a possible mechanism for the increase of vacuoles in the  zona fasciculata could 
be extensive activation of the zona glomerulosa resulting in an increased production of corticosterone 
and aldosterone. Collectively, the explanations and suggestions seem reasonable. Regarding clinical 
relevance, it is agreed that the  effects were mainly noted at concentrations considered in excess of 
human clinical exposure. 
In the 4-week study in dog, eosinophilic cytoplasmic change of the zona glomerulosa was noted. The 
finding did not  fully recover in the 4-week study (the only dog study with recovery animals). Overall, in 
Assessment report  
EMA/78746/2022  
Page 33/159 
 
 
 
the absence of degenerative or inflammatory findings  in the adrenals, the adrenals findings  are not 
considered to be of concern, and are known compensatory effects of aldosterone inhibition. 
Urinary tract  and kidneys 
In the rat 4- and 13-week studies, hyperplasia of the  transitional epithelium of the urinary bladder 
were noted,  occasionally with inflammatory infiltrates.  The finding  did not recover in the 4-week study. 
In both studies, necrotic findings were evident in the  kidney with  increased mineralisation at the 
corticomedullary border with  tubulopathy of the proximal tubule  P3 segment associated with  basophilic 
tubules. This correlated with  increased kidney weights,  increased urea levels and an increased urinary 
excretion of µ-GST (with increased excreted µ-GST/Crea levels). According to  the applicant, the focal 
mineralisation in the kidney may be associated with  the increase in serum calcium levels and urinary 
pH,  which is supported by the lack of such effects (and mineralisation) in  the chronic studies in  rat. 
While this  may be agreed, it does not  explain the tubulopathy  of the P3 segments. Still,  as no findings 
were noted in  the chronic studies (or in the  dog studies) the  long-term relevance of the finding is 
unclear. The bladder effects were also not seen in  the chronic studies  or in dogs, perhaps suggestive of 
adaption with  time in rat. Regardless, the kidney findings are related to the MoA and are not 
considered unexpected.   
Reproductive organs 
In the rat 4-week study,  reversible changes were evident in  the female genital tract at 30mg/kg/day 
which were composed of foamy corpus luteum cells in the ovary, atrophy of myo-/endometrium and 
cervical epithelium in the uterus. Further,  atrophy with mucification of the vagina was evident. Similar 
findings were also seen int  the 13-week study but here there were also findings of diffuse atrophy of 
the mammary glands. According to the applicant,  these changes are considered secondary 
pharmacological effects, possibly due to  a cross-reactivity with  other steroid receptors at the  higher 
doses. Further,  as MRs are expressed in the ovary and other female gonadal tissues, it  is possible that 
high levels of finerenone might  interfere with  ovarian regulation. While it is possible, no hormone levels 
have been made available, and it is rather speculative. In any case, no similar findings are reported 
from the  26-week study, which  is somewhat surprising given that the  ovary findings in the 13-week 
study were evident already at 10 mg/kg/day. 
In the mouse 13-week study, increased testes weights were recorded from 3mg/kg/day which 
correlated with  increased germinal epithelium debris (incidence 1/2/2/6  and graded minimal) at 
10mg/kg/day. No similar findings  were recorded in rat or dog, or in the carcinogenicity studies in  rat 
and mice why the  finding is of unclear relevance. However, In male dogs, chronic administration  (up to 
39-weeks) of finerenone resulted in reduced prostate size and weight starting  at 1.5 mg/kg/day  which 
correlated with  reduced size of prostate at necropsy in one male at 1.5mg/kg/day and 2 males at 
5mg/kg/day. The prostate had not been a target organ of toxicity in the 4- and 13-week studies, 
suggesting that  longer-term exposures are required for the development. While no supporting 
histopathology findings were noted this is still considered treatment  related and possibly clinically 
relevant as the MoE is only 10. Accordingly, as an OC the applicant was asked to  include these data in 
section 5.3 of the SmPC. According to the applicant, the overall effect of finerenone on prostate weight 
was mild and only the  animals with  reduced prostate size had weights  below the  lowest control animal. 
While it  is agreed that  the lowest control weight  was low, another way of putting  it is that  the lowest 
control prostate weight was lower than only one prostate weight at  ≥1.5 mg/kg/day. While  it is agreed 
that  prostate weight  was not statistically significantly different in the  treated group, a sample size of 
n=4 gives low power to detect  small (but  possibly biologically relevant) differences. It is agreed that 
the lack of effect noted in the 4- and 13-week dog studies may be related to the  sexual immaturity of 
the dogs in those studies. If sexually mature dogs had been used, lower prostate weights  may have 
been obvious earlier than 39-weeks, further supporting the influence of finerenone on prostate size

and weight. While  the comparison with  eplenerone is interesting  (for eplerenone, a mild hormonal 
imbalance was identified as the most likely cause for the changes, why it is possible that  a similar 
explanation holds true also for finerenone), the effects on prostate weight  and size was more severe 
after eplenerone exposure, possibly related to the slight  anti-androgenic effect of the substance. While 
no anti-androgenic effects have been reported for finerenone, the finerenone induced effects on 
prostate weight/size may be related to  hormonal imbalance via the MR. Thus, given the relatively low 
MoE (LOAEL=10,  NOAEL=2)  and no reason to assume lower human susceptibility, the applicant was 
asked to include the findings  in SmPC section 5.3 along with  relevant margins of exposure to clinical 
exposure. In the response, the applicant agreed that  the low margin of exposure for the  prostate 
finding in  the dog to human clinical exposure may suggest a clinical relevance. However, it was the 
applicant’s view that the limited  effect size (in terms of absolute prostate weight change), the lack of 
clear progression with  increased dose and the identification  of the  prostate finding  in only a subset of 
the animals suggests limited clinical relevance. While it  was agreed that the effect size was not  great, 
the lack of dose-response is not a valid argument in this  case. The finding was only identified in  the 
39-week study, was considered adverse by the study pathologist and had limited margins to clinical 
exposure at NOAEL and LOAEL. Further,  as no recovery group was used in the  study, the potential for 
recovery is not known. As finerenone treatment is a chronic treatment  it was also not  clear if the 
effects would  progress with longer treatment.  
The applicant agreed to include the finding in  section 5.3  of the SmPC and proposed an update of the 
repeated dose toxicity paragraph. This text  was edited by the Assessor to reflect that  the relevance of 
the finding  is unclear. Further clinical development of the product may clarify to what  extent the 
prostate is a target of toxicity also in human. 
2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
A full programme of genotoxicity studies has been performed by the applicant. The Ames test 
performed in the Salmonella strains TA98, TA100, TA102, TA1535, and TA1537 was negative up to 
5000  μg finerenone per plate, suggesting no mutagenic activity of finerenone. Based on the data 
presented from the in vitro micronucleus test,  finerenone is not considered to be a clastogen. An in 
vivo micronucleus assay in male where bone marrow smears were evaluated. Exposures up to 
1000mg/kg/day did not find evidence of increased fractions of micronucleated polychromatic 
erythrocytes. However, from 250 mg/kg/day, signs of toxicity were evident with  an altered fraction of 
NCE to  PCE. Collectively, finerenone is not  considered clastogenic. In summary, the  genotoxicity 
studies presented do not indicate a genotoxic risk for finerenone. 
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
The carcinogenic potential of firenenone was evaluated in a programme which included two 104-week 
carcinogenicity studies. While the  applicant was advised by the CHMP  to consider using a short or 
medium-term in vivo rodent test system or alternative methods in combination with  a 2-year 
carcinogenicity study, the  programme as presented is in accordance with  ICH S1B and is thus 
acceptable. 
Mouse 104-week carcinogenicity study 
Based on recommendations from FDA and a single-dose TK study in the mouse strain used for the 
carcinogenicity study, the  high doses in the study were set at 30mg/kg/day for males and 
7.5mg/kg/day for females. Mortality  and survival rates were similar across dose-groups. Further, 
macroscopic and microscopic findings  did not differ between early terminated animals and those

surviving the  full 104 weeks. It was however noted that  only 24/60, 26/60  and 26/60  females survived 
in the control, 2.5  and 7.5 mg/kg/day dose-groups. While this  is considered low, it is acceptable. 
Macroscopic examinations revealed enlargement and/or a pale area of the testes in several male mice 
from 3mg/kg/day. This correlated microscopically with increased incidence of Leydig cell adenoma in 
males administered 30 mg/kg/day when compared to both  study control groups and the Covance 
historical control data in mice of this  strain. The adenomas were present unilaterally in all animals, and 
(except in  one case) only in animals surviving to terminal sacrifice suggesting a late occurrence. In 
combination with  the lack of genotoxic effects of finerenone, this supports that  the finding is likely an 
indirect effect perhaps related to hormonal perturbation. However, the  applicant was asked to further 
support this issue.  As MR are expressed in rat testes (selectively localised to  Leydig cells) and 
aldosterone increases testosterone production in  Leydig cells, the applicant suggests that  blocking of 
the MR by finerenone may reduce testosterone production in  Leydig cells. This blocking may then 
increase LH  secretion (from the  pituitary) to increase testosterone production. While this  sequence of 
events is possible, available data do not  support reduced hormone levels in the  carcinogenicity studies. 
Therefore, the applicant suggests that the  findings were only an enhancement of spontaneous age-
related changes. While the findings in  the control group may represent background findings, the clear 
increase in pale area and/or macroscopic enlargement of the testis in males administered 3, 10,  or 30 
mg/kg/day, and a statistically significant  increased incidence of Leydig cell adenoma in the testis  of 
males administered 30 mg/kg/day are considered finerenone-induced effects. However, given the 
known susceptibility of rodents to develop adenomas, differences in the number of LH  and LH-related 
aging changes and the fact that  the increase in adenoma findings  were only noted with a MoE of 22x to 
human clinical exposure the clinical relevance is uncertain. Still, the  findings should (and are) included 
in section 5.3 of the SmPC. Females given 2.5mg/kg/day finerenone had significantly increased 
incidences of combined haemolymphoreticular tumours, whereas females given 0.75mg/kg/day 
finerenone showed significantly  increased combined uterine stromal tumours. According to the 
historical control database, these tumours are common and were not increased in the high-dose group. 
While lack of dose-response is not  a sufficient  argument on its  own, the fact that  the incidences were 
included in the historical control database supports that  they are not likely toxicologically significant. 
Rat 104-week carcinogenicity study 
In the rat, the dose-levels used in  the study were based on the  13-week and 26-week studies in male 
and female rats. As pointed out  in the repeated-dose toxicity section, different strains were used in 
these studies. In the carcinogenicity study, the same strains as used in the 26-week study was used 
(RccHan:WIST), but the origin of the animals differed. Overall, based on the  effects on body weight 
gain noted in, the doses used are considered sufficient. 
Reduced ovary weights down to  0.3x control weight  were not  correlated with macro or microscopic 
effects. Given the large effect on ovary weight, this is odd. Reduced kidney weight correlated with 
electrolyte balance effects, and is together with  the effects on water consumption likely an effect 
downstream of aldosterone inhibition.  Further  anti-aldosterone effects were seen in the adrenals and 
included slight  to severe diffuse hypertrophy of zona glomerulosa, vacuolation of zona glomerulosa and 
increased incidence of cortico-medullary pigments at 20mg/kg/day. 
The only neoplastic observation was fibroadenoma in the mammary gland. However, while there were 
increased incidences in the  1 and 10mg/kg/day dose-groups, the incidence was even higher in the 
saline control group compared to the vehicle control. Further, this  is a very common tumour  in the rat 
with  low progression to malignancy. Collectively, the  finding is not considered finerenone induced and 
clinically relevant. Therefore, the highest dose-levels tested in both sexes are considered to be without 
evidence of carcinogenicity.

2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental  toxicity 
A full programme of reproductive and developmental studies has been performed with  finerenone, 
which also includes a 13-week juvenile toxicity study in rats to  support paediatric development in 
patients from the age of 6 months.  Further, a fertility study in juvenile female rats was performed over 
a period of 94 days. While  the present application concerns adult  patients, the juvenile toxicity studies 
have been evaluated in the assessment report.  
FEED study in  rats 
In the fertility study, reductions in body weight gain was noted in both  sexes and from the lowest dose 
tested. In males, dose-related reductions of up to 52%  were noted in the premating period, which led 
to mean body weights  0.96-0.89x control weights.  In females, weight gains were drastically reduced 
from 10mg/kg/day during premating, whereas similar weight changes were noted during gestation. 
No differences were noted on time to  insemination, and absolute testes weights  were comparable 
across groups. Absolute and relative ovary weights were decreased from 10mg/kg/day. The number of 
corpora lutea and number of implantation  sites were significantly lower at 30mg/kg/day suggesting 
effects on female fertility.  Further, at the  same dose, postimplantation  loss was increased and the 
number of viable embryos was reduced suggesting  effects on early embryonic development. According 
to the applicant,  no systemic toxicity NOAEL was possible due to the  body-weight effects noted at all 
dose-levels. This is agreed. Fertility NOAEL  is set to  30mg/kg/day in males and 3mg/kg/day for female 
fertility and early embryonic development corresponding to MoE  of 16x and 10x respectively.  
Embryo-foetal development (EFD)  studies 
Rat 
Based on maternal toxicity and malformations in a DRF-study in rats at 100mg/kg/day, 30mg/kg/day 
was chosen as the high-dose in the pivotal study. No deaths or early terminations were noted in the 
study, and clinical signs were mainly restricted to  increased water consumption at  10mg/kg/day and 
increased urination at 30mg/kg/day. Body-weight development was clearly and significantly decreased 
in the dams from 10mg/kg/day. Between GD6 and GD17, body-weight increases were 0.75x and 0.46x 
control values at 10 and 30mg/kg/day respectively. Food consumption was decreased during the initial 
days of gestation.  
Fertility  rates, number of implantations, pre-implantation loss, post-implantation  loss and foetal sex 
were overall similar between groups. However, placental weights  and foetal weights  were significantly 
reduced in dams administered 10  or 30 mg/kg/day which also correlated with  significantly retarded 
skeletal ossifications at these dose-levels. 
At 30mg/kg/day, one foetus displayed several malformations, including  double aortic arch, septal 
defects and further heart and vessel malformations, reduced spleen size and malformed lung. It  is 
noted that  a similar malformation was evident in one foetus in the DRF-study. As no data has been 
made available from the DRF-study, it  is however difficult  to further evaluate similarities between the 
findings. The applicant was therefore asked to further discuss these malformations. Further, the full 
reports from the DRF-studies in both  rat and rabbit  should be submitted.  The applicant gave a very 
limited discussion of the double aortic arch noted in two finerenone-treated foetuses. While it  is curious 
that  such a finding  occurs twice in a development programme, it  is agreed that  the significance is 
unclear. 
Skeletal malformations were also noted at 30mg/kg/day which were inside historical control data and 
thus with  unclear treatment relation.

Among visceral and external deviations, the shorter umbilical cords at 30mg/kg/day seems clearly 
treatment related. It has been proposed, also in the rat, that  restrictions in foetal movements may 
lead to short umbilical cord (doi: 10.1203/00006450-198202000-00006).  Further,  shorter cords have 
been associated with low birth-weight  (doi: 10.1097/01.AOG.0000102706.84063.C7)  and adverse 
foetal outcomes, why a causative correlation to  the smaller foetuses seen at 10 and 30mg/kg/day is 
possible. According to the applicant, shorter umbilical cords were also noted in the DRF-study.   
Oedema was noted in 4 foetuses at  30 and 1 each at 3 and 10mg/kg/day. The oedema finding at 30 
mg/kg/day is considered to be likely treatment related as it  was outside historical control data. The 
single occurrences at the  lower doses are possibly chance findings.   
Skeletal variations were increased from 10mg/kg/day, and were mainly related to ossification 
retardations. However, at 30mg/kg/day skeletal variations also included increased findings of slightly 
enlarged fontanelle. 
Collectively, finerenone induced clear and significant effects on maternal body-weight development 
from 10mg/kg/day, which also correlated with  reduced foetal weights and also shortened umbilical 
cords at 30mg/kg/day. Further,  retarded skeletal ossifications from 10mg/kg/day with findings  of 
enlarged fontanelle at 30mg/kg/day were evident. One foetus at the  highest dose displayed several 
malformations, including  double aortic arch, septal defects and further heart and vessel malformations, 
reduced spleen size and malformed lung. As this rare finding  was previously found also in the pilot 
study, it  is considered related to the finerenone treatment.  Due to maternal toxicity (mainly body-
weight  reductions) at  and above 10mg/kg/day, a NOAEL is set at 3mg/kg/day. Foetal  malformations 
and variations were noted from 10mg/kg/day why foetal NOAEL  is set at  3mg/kg/day. Given a margin 
to clinical exposure of only 10, there is concern for early pregnancy in the clinical situation. 
Rabbit 
In the pivotal study, finerenone was overall well-tolerated. However, one female (at the high-dose) 
was found dead on SD24 after having displayed general toxicity (including  body-weight loss and 
decreased water consumption),  why this mortality may be treatment related.  
No effects on water consumption  were documented, but food consumption was reduced (17%) at 
2.5mg/kg/day during the first 6 treatment days. No effects were noted on female fertility or early and 
late embryonic development. While no effects were evident on placenta weights,  hardened and 
discoloured parts of placenta were found with  the highest incidence noted at 0.25mg/kg/day. The 
significance of this  finding is unclear. Foetal  weights were not  affected by finerenone treatment.  
Forelimbs were malrotated in 11 foetuses of finerenone treated dams but no control foetuses had this 
malformation. Even if the applicant declared that  this finding  may occur spontaneously in the rabbit 
strain used and that  the incidences (3.8% affected foetuses, 23.5%  affected litters)  lay inside the 
normal range of scattering, the treatment-relation cannot be completed excluded. According to the 
study report, this finding may occur spontaneously in the rabbit strain used and malposition of the 
forelimb(s), which does not  include skeletal changes, is the most common spontaneous malformation 
in the rabbit strain used and is caused most likely by restriction of foetal movement in the uterus. 
Further, the  study report suggests that  3.8 % affected foetuses (23.5 % affected litters) lay inside the 
normal range of scattering (up to 5.9 % affected foetuses, up to  31.25 % affected litters with 
malposition of forelimb). While it  seems to be a spontaneous finding in  the rabbits used (based on the 
historical control data provided) the most recent historical control data (2010)  suggests an incidence of 
0.9%.  Also, while not  a clear dose-response effect, the  effect is clearly finerenone treatment related 
given the lack of findings in the control group. It is to this end surprising that  not a word is spent in the 
toxicological summary on this  matter. It is merely stated that  “no effects on external, visceral and 
skeletal variations and not  indication of an increase in malformations was found”. The applicant was 
Assessment report  
EMA/78746/2022  
Page 38/159 
 
 
 
therefore asked to further elaborate on the significance of the  malpositioned forelimb findings and 
reflect on why finerenone exposure leads to  restricted movement in the uterus. The applicant 
elaborated on the significance of the  malpositioned forelimb and also provided with  plausible 
explanations for the restricted movement in the uterus. The malposition of the forelimb is by the 
applicant considered a relatively common deformation rather than a malformation, which is 
exacerbated by the finerenone treatment  at 0.75 mg/kg/day. It  is agreed that there is a finerenone-
relation in the finding and that  the Himalayan rabbit is prone to develop these malpositions. The 
applicant further suggests, based on Palmer (1978),  that  these effects can occur with  drugs which 
reduced the amniotic fluid  volume. While only indirect inference can be made, based on the PD of 
finerenone, an indirect effect on amniotic fluid volume is possible but  has not been shown.  Still, given 
that  roughly one foetus per litter  was affected (in the affected litters) and the variation in PD 
symptoms of the dams (e.g. dehydration) it would be expected that  the females with  the most severe 
symptoms would  generate the foetuses with  the  malpositioned forelimbs. It is not clear if this  is the 
case. Further,  did the foetal position within  the uterine horn affect the  outcome of the foetal forelimb 
malposition? To what extent are these findings  reversible postnatally? The applicant was therefore 
asked to further elaborate on the findings along these lines and include detailed descriptions of the 
findings. In the response, the applicant  stated that the  malpositioned forelimbs noted in the rabbit 
EFD-study with  1(1),  5(5) and 5(4)  foetuses (litters)  showing the deviation at 0.25, 0.75  and 2,5 
mg/kg/day respectively, was a spontaneous background finding. This was not  fully agreed. While the 
particular strain of rabbit (Himalayan rabbit) shows a relatively high (but  very variable over time) 
background incidence of the  finding in the performing site,  the lack of such deviations in the  control 
group suggests a treatment  relation. The applicant further clarified that  the finding  was confined to the 
ventral flexure of the forelimb at the region of the  wrist (i.e. carpal flexure) without  any associated 
skeletal findings.  Further, the applicant stated that  the flexures resolve spontaneously in a short time 
and are therefore not adverse. This latter conclusion is in part derived from a publication from DeSesso 
and Scialli (2018)  where the authors further suggest that more appropriate classification for carpal 
flexure with  normal skeletal anatomy in rabbits is that  of (reversible) deformation. While  it can be 
agreed that  the finding (as described) is not considered adverse as it  likely resolves postnatally, the 
deformation was still  considered treatment related but  of minor clinical relevance. Based on a likely 
treatment-related mortality and effects on food consumption and correlated reduction in  weight 
development at 2.5  mg/kg/day, a maternal NOAEL  of 0.75mg/kg/day is supported.  
PPND study 
A pivotal PPND-study was performed in Wistar rat (Crl:WI(Han)). As this strain is different from the 
strain used in the EFD-study,  the applicant performed a DRF study at 3,  10 and 30mg/kg/day to 
support dose-selection in the  pivotal study. In the DRF-study,  stillbirths  were noted in all finerenone 
groups (2, 2 and 3 stillbirths  at 3, 10 and 30mg/kg/day respectively). Further, complete litter  losses 
were noted at  3 and 30mg/kg/day. At 30mg/kg/day, a higher incidence of missing/presumed 
cannibalised pups was noted including  blue coloured pups. Thus, all doses in the DRF study were 
associated with  pup mortalities suggestive of late developmental and/or parturition effects. As only 
macroscopic evaluations were made, no data are available on visceral and skeletal malformations or 
variations/deviations. 
In the pivotal study, bodyweight gain was significantly decreased in all finerenone exposed groups but 
translated only to a significant  body weight  reduction in the 10mg/kg/day dose group. Body-weight 
reductions correlated with  food intake reductions during gestation all dose-groups in a dose-dependent 
fashion. A reduced food consumption was also seen during lactation in  all groups (up to 0.88x  mean 
consumption in the  control group), but  without  dose-relation. 
3 pups were stillborn  at 10mg/kg/day, and 1 stillborn  pup with  a deformed head was found in  the 
1mg/kg/day group. Further,  the number of dead/missing/canibalised pups increased in finerenone 
Assessment report  
EMA/78746/2022  
Page 39/159 
 
 
 
exposed groups. While one pup each was missing in the  control and 1 mg/kg/day group, 2 pups were 
found dead at  3mg/kg/day (PND0 and PND9) and 2 were cannibalised. At 10 mg/kg/day, 1  pup was 
found dead on LD0 and 3 were canibalised before PND1. While the nature of pup cannibalisation in the 
early postnatal period is unclear, maternal stress and/or deformed or dead pups are often cited as 
possible underlying reasons. Given the deformed head noted in one dead pup in the  1mg/kg/day group 
(which may be incidental)  and the pups found dead early after parturition in the  3 and 10mg/kg/day 
dose-groups, it  is not excluded that  the pups cannibalised were not fit for postnatal life. 
In the surviving pups, mean weights were reduced in the finerenone treatment  groups at birth  and 
through lactation.  As concentrations in the pups on PND 7 (see toxicokinetics section) were 17-24%  of 
respective values in the dams it can be concluded that  lactational exposure occurs. Pinna unfolding was 
significantly later in pups to mothers exposed at 10mg/kg/day, which  is an indication  of developmental 
toxicity. While bodyweights were decreased in all finerenone exposed groups (11-12%  lower at PND22 
in the 10mg/kg/day dose-group), no significant  effects were noted were noted on sexual development. 
That said, mean day for vaginal opening in females developmentally exposed to finerenone at  3 or 
10mg/kg/day was 33  days compared to 32 for controls, but without  statistical  significance. 
Behaviour assessments in the F1-generation on PND 28 evidenced increased counts in all parameters 
of locomotor activity (total  activity, mobile counts and rears) in rats to mothers exposed to finerenone 
at 3mg/kg/day or higher. No treatment-related effects were noted on learning and memory in the 
Morris water maze or in pre-pulse inhibition  measurements. 
The F1-generation mated without  effects on mating,  fecundity or fertility noted. However, the mean 
number of corpora lutea and implantation  sites was reduced in the F1-dams related to finerenone 
exposure at 3 or 10mg/kg/day. According to  the applicant, this was due to unusually high numbers of 
corpora lutea and implantation sites in controls, why the findings  should be considered incidental.  It is 
agreed that  the control group has unusually high implantation  numbers. However, while numerically 
small effects, it  is curious that  there is dose-relation in the reductions noted, suggesting a potential 
treatment effect. Further, given that  other indices of toxicity were noted in the  F1-generation of 
females (including  effects on bodyweight through gestation)  a treatment  effect is considered likely. 
The data described in the PPND-study makes clear that  maternal exposure to finerenone at 3 and 
10mg/kg day is associated with  developmental toxicity where dam bodyweight and feed reductions in 
the F0-generation translated into  increased incidences of foetal- and postnatal  pup mortalities in F1. 
The surviving F1  pups had consistently lower body weights  through weaning and into gestation  of the 
second generation. Further, neurodevelopmental effects in  the F1-generation were noted on locomotor 
activity, where increased activity ( i.e. a hyperactive behaviour) was clear. While no effects were 
evident on mating, fertility or fecundity in this generation, an arguable reduction of the mean number 
of corpora lutea and implantation  sites was noted.  
Finerenone-related effects at 1mg/kg/day included slight  bodyweight and bodyweight  gain and feed 
reductions in the F0-generation. 1  stillborn pup (with  deformed head) and one missing pup postnatally 
(likely cannibalised on PND 0)  is of concern. Further, F1  males displayed macroscopic liver (large, 
mottled) and kidney (pale, mottled)  effects which  are considered treatment related. The significance of 
these macroscopic effects are not clear, as no histopathology evaluations are performed on F1  adults. 
The lack of kidney and liver findings in females is not  considered assuring, but  the overall conclusion is 
that  the findings are not  adverse. Collectively, a dam NOAEL is set to 3mg/kg/day, whereas a pup 
NOAEL of 1mg/kg/day is derived. The pup NOAEL corresponds to a margin to clinical exposure (AUC) 
of 1.8. Accordingly, the findings  noted are considered of clear clinical concern, which should be 
reflected in recommendations for WOCBP, pregnancy and lactation in  section 4.6. 
Collectively, the DART programme has evidenced reproductive toxicity including malformations and 
still-births  with  low margins to  clinical exposure. These findings  are not compatible with  a safe

finerenone use during pregnancy and lactation, and the substance should not be used by women of 
reproductive age not  using appropriate contraception. This is reflected in the SmPC section 4.6.  in 
accordance with the  updates provided in  the SmPC document, along with  qualitative descriptions with 
margins to clinical exposure based on NOAEL  in section 5.3.  
Juvenile toxicity 
A 3-month juvenile toxicity study with a 4-week recovery period has been performed in Wistar rats 
with  start of exposure at PND 14.  Body weights in males were differently affected with  dose, as the 
weights were significantly decreased at 3mg/kg/day, but significantly increased at 10mg/kg/day. 
According to the  applicant, body weights  in high dose main group males were higher compared to 
control males already prior to  first treatment, why the effect in this group is seen as a chance finding. 
Further, the  applicant is of the  opinion that the  slight reduction in the mid dose is not relevant as no 
trend is seen. Indeed, it seems as if the weights were increased in the HD already from start,  and it  is 
very unfortunate. This makes the weight  measurements difficult to evaluate. While it was anticipated 
that  the weights would be reduced with  treatment (based on general toxicity data in adults) it  is not 
possible to  conclude that.  Further, no data has been made available on food consumption, which  would 
have been another useful, possibly related, metric.  
No effects were noted on sex development (balano-preputial separation and vaginal opening). Selected 
findings on haematology parameters observed after recovery but they were not seen during  the dosing 
period. The only histopathological correlates were readings of zona glomerulosa hypertrophy, which 
were only partly resolved after recovery. Further, vacuoles were seen in both  zona fasciculata and zona 
glomerulosa (also after recovery). 
Curiously, according to the study report, 3 histiocytic sarcomas were encountered at terminal sacrifice 
in 3 animals in the study (2 males at 3mg/kg/day and one female at 10mg/kg/day). The tumours had 
already spread to several organs and caused the moribund condition of one animal A treatment-
relation was not assumed by the applicant and these animals were excluded from all data tables. 
However, histiocytic  sarcoma is the  most frequent haematopoietic tumour in rats, but  rarely occurs 
before 12 months of age (doi: 10.1293/tox.23.161).  It is characterised by the proliferation of 
malignant cells that  have the morphological and immunohistochemical characteristics of mature tissue 
histiocytes. The tumour cells have a typical histiocytic appearance. Based on literature, the cytoplasm 
is relatively broad and eosinophilic and may contain vacuoles or phagocytised erythrocytes 
(doi:10.1007/978-3-642-84110-1_7).  The applicant  was  asked to  further  comment  on the  sarcoma 
findings  in  relation  to  the  age of the  rats,  the  exposure,  and the  possible  association  of the 
haematology  findings  in the  study.  According to literature, genetic traits may influence the frequency 
of histiocytic sarcoma. The applicant describes that two,  and possibly all three cases in the study were 
siblings and therefore suggests that a genetic trait is the  most likely cause of the sarcomas. While 
there may be a genetic (likely polygenic) factor involved, it is a neoplasm that  may occur de novo or in 
the context of a previous haematologic malignancy (https://doi.org/10.3324/haematol.2019.230375). 
We do not know why the sarcomas developed in these animals, and although the cases were all in 
finerenone-treated groups it is not possible to label the findings as clearly treatment-related. No  similar 
findings were evident in the  repeated-dose toxicity studies or in the carcinogenicity studies,  except for 
one case in the control group of the  104-week study  in rat. It is unclear if any of his siblings were 
included in a finerenone-treated group. In any case, the histiocytic  sarcomas identified in  three animals 
in the juvenile toxicity study are likely spurious findings with  unclear relation to finerenone treatment. 
While  the  indication  applied  for  in  this  MAA concerns  adults,  it  is  stressed  that  this  issue  should  be 
further  discussed  in  the  event  a future  application  for finerenone  in  paediatric  population.   
The  epididymis,  seminal  vesicles  and  prostate  weights  (among  other  organs)  are reduced  at 
10mg/kg/day  after  recovery. General  toxicology  findings  of  reduced  prostate  weights  and other 
Assessment report

effects  on  male  and  female genitals  have been  seen in  the  programme,  where  “a mild hormonal 
imbalance” has been suggested as a possible explanation for the effects. With this  in mind, the 
applicant was therefore asked to further discuss this finding. According to the applicant, the weights  of 
the male reproductive organs never differed significantly when the comparisons relative to body weight 
were made (data not included in the response). Further,  at the end of the recovery phase the control 
groups showed a higher body weight  and the high dose males had a slightly  lower body weight which 
according to  the applicant is likely a chance finding. When bodyweights are considered unreliable, 
other relative comparisons are frequently seen, e.g. relative to brain weight.  The applicant was thus 
asked to provide with  additional relative comparisons of the reproductive organs to  increase clarity. In 
the response, the applicant clarified the mean weights  of male sex organs both  in relation to body 
weight  and also for brain weight.  Regarding the prostate weights, a single control individual had an 
unusually high weight,  which was likely the result of a technical mistake. The other relatively small 
differences in sex organ weights (including the  epididymes weights) were not considered to be related 
to finerenone treatment. 
Collectively, the toxicity profile in the juvenile population  is similar to the  profile in adult animals. 
However, histiocytic  sarcomas were evident in the  juvenile rat study with  finerenone. Although 
according to  literature, genetic traits  may influence the frequency of histiocytic sarcoma and the 
applicant describes that  two, and possibly all three cases in the study were siblings, histiocytic sarcoma 
may also occur de novo or in the context of a previous haematologic malignancy. It is not possible to 
label the findings as clearly treatment related. No  similar findings were evident in the  repeated-dose 
toxicity studies or in the carcinogenicity studies, except for one case in the control group of the 104-
week study in rat. The histiocytic sarcomas identified in three animals in the juvenile toxicity study are 
likely spurious findings with  unclear relation to finerenone treatment. 
Juvenile fertility study in females 
In the juvenile female fertility  study, finerenone treatment was well-tolerated, and no deaths or clinical 
signs considered finerenone-related were seen. No  effects were noted on fertility,  fecundity or 
intrauterine development of the foetuses. Based on the lack effects, a NOAEL  is set on the  highest dose 
10mg/kg/day.   
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic investigation have been performed in mice, rats and dogs, both in terms of total AUC and 
Cmax as well as after correction for protein binding (AUCu and Cmax,u). 
After single dose administration in mice, the exposure of finerenone (AUC(0-24)  and Cmax) increased 
less than  proportionally with  increase of dose, indicating a plateau from 30 mg/kg onwards. Saturation 
of exposure at 30 mg/kg was confirmed during  3-weeks repeat-dose administration via gavage in 
mice: exposure at the  dose of 50 mg/kg/day was comparable to the one reached at 150 mg/kg/day.  
In the pivotal 13-week repeat-dose toxicity study with  once daily administration by gavage, finerenone 
was tested at dose levels of 1 to 10  mg/kg/day in males and 0.75  to 7.5 mg/kg/day in females in order 
to achieve comparable exposure levels in both sexes. In this study, multiples of exposure of 15 to 21 
were reached at the  high dose. 
In rats, finerenone was tested in pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies with treatment  duration of 4,  13 
and 26 weeks. As already observed in mice, toxicokinetic investigation  showed a dose-related and less 
than dose proportional increase of exposure in female rats over the whole dose range, and in male rats 
starting at  15 mg/kg/day. In rats, exposure was higher in females than  in males, which was considered 
for dose selection in the long-term study, where female rats were treated at lower dose levels than 
Assessment report

males, so that  similar exposure ranges were reached in both sexes. The high  dose of 30 mg/kg/day 
resulted in clear-cut signs of general toxicity including  markedly reduced body weight gain, which  was 
more pronounced in female animals (because of the difference in exposure between sexes). 
In dogs, toxicokinetics revealed no differences in exposure between sexes. AUC(0-24) increased 
considerably more than proportionally with increase of dose from the mid to the high  dose group after 
multiple dose administration. From the low to  the mid dose group a tendency for a moderate more 
than dose proportional increase of AUC was observed. With  regard to Cmax only from the low  to the 
mid dose group a slightly over-proportional increase of exposure occurred. 
2.5.4.7.  Local Tolerance 
No local tolerance studies are considered necessary as the oral route is intended  for the product. 
However, to  support a clinical bioavailability study, a local tolerance study using intravenous and 
paravenous administration was performed in the  rabbit. No relevant findings of irritation  were noted. 
2.5.4.8.  Other  toxicity studies 
Metabolites 
While all human major metabolites have been covered in the performed toxicology study programme 
in rats, a SAR study further concluded that  the major human metabolites have no alerts for 
mutagenicity and were assigned to impurity class 5. 
Impurities 
Based on information provided referencing data from the quality dossier, no further impurity studies 
should be necessary. However, see quality AR for further information on this  issue. 
Phototoxicity 
A phototoxicity assessment of finerenone was performed, based on two GLP-compliant studies in the 
test facility. In the first 3T3-NRU  phototoxicity assay, considerable variability was seen, and the mean 
was over 5 (suggestive of a phototoxic effect). In the  second assay, a mean PIF of 1.8 resulted. The 
applicant was asked to explain why the  results in  the two studies were so different, considering that 
they were both  GLP-compliant and run at  the same test facility. Further,  a conclusion regarding the 
phototoxic potential of finerenone should be provided. The applicant provided with  an explanation for 
the variability in test results for the  two performed GLP-compliant phototoxicity studies. Collectively 
the approach taken is agreed with  and supports that  finerenone has no phototoxic potential. 
To conclude, the  non-clinical toxicity of finerenone has been evaluated in a full programme of toxicity 
studies. Given the  MR-antagonist pharmacology of the substance, expected effects have been noted on 
water and electrolyte balance, including  compensatory hypertrophy of the  zona glomerulosa (the site 
of aldosterone synthesis in  the adrenal cortex) in  all species from the lowest doses tested.  Further, 
effects on kidney, liver, reproductive organs were evident, but  they should overall be monitorable in 
the clinical setting. 
Reproductive toxicities during pregnancy and early postnatal period should limit  the use of the product 
in women of child-bearing potential  not using contraception. Further,  given the behavioural effects in 
offspring exposed during pregnancy and lactation,  and the  passage of the  substance to breast-milk, 
breast-feeding should clearly be avoided. Treatment was well-tolerated in juvenile animals. However, 3 
cases of histiocytic sarcomas were encountered in  the treated groups of unclear significance.

In the mouse carcinogenicity study, an increased incidence of Leydig cell adenoma was noted in males 
administered 30  mg/kg/day when compared to both study  control groups and the Covance historical 
control data in mice of this  strain. In combination with the  lack of genotoxic effects of finerenone, this 
supports that  the finding is likely an indirect effect perhaps related to  hormonal perturbation.  
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Distribution studies  showed that  finerenone is primarily distributed  to the sediment compartment, and 
not degraded. The degradation half-life in  sediment (equal to total  systems half-life) was between 14.5 
and 44.2d (temperature adjusted to 12C). There are some issues with  the DT50 calculations (see 
Discussion). It should be noted that  the applicant used sediments from the Teltowkanal located in  the 
middle of Berlin, Germany for both  test systems. The Teltowkanal is known for its high  degree of 
pollution.  Therefore, the outcome of the sediment study is likely to be influenced by a variety of 
chemicals including  other pharmaceuticals. That being said, considering the results of the present 
study, it  is unlikely that  a new study would  not lead to  different conclusions. The dissipation half-life 
from water was determined with 78.9  and 147.9 days for sediment 1 and 2, respectively. The 
degradation half-life in sediment (=  whole system degradation half-life) was 80.05  and 191.7  days for 
sediment 1 and 2, respectively. Based on the  data, finerenone has to  be classified as very persistent 
(vP).  
Fish (fathead minnow)  was the  most sensitive species for finerenone aquatic effects, with  a NOEC of 
0.00001  mg/L (0.01µg/L).  RQ-values (based on unrefined and refined PECsw values) show that 
finerenone poses a risk to  the surface-water compartment but not the  ground water.  
Since the  applicant used non-labelled test substance and open systems in the OECD 307 study, it  is 
impossible to  track the fate of the test substance over the course of the study. The dissipation rates in 
the test  systems and in the sterile control were comparably high. Thus, the dissipation rates cannot be 
explained by degradation. No transformation products were detected, no mineralisation could be 
determined due to the  open systems and the  extraction method used by the  applicant was weak. 
Consequently, according to the very high log Koc value of 8.1  for finerenone the  dissipation has to  be 
considered as adsorption instead of degradation. Therefore, it is not  suitable to calculate plausible 
DT50 values out of the data provided.  
The presence of finerenone in the  wastewater treatment  plants following excretion will  not impact the 
performance of the sludge microorganisms. Studies in sediment dwellers (Chironomus riparius) gave a 
NOEC of 46.7mg/kg, resulting in  a RQ for sediment of 27, indicating  an environmental risk to  the 
sediment compartment.  
Terrestrial toxicity tests suggested that  Glycine max was the most sensitive species (phytotoxicity). 
The EC20 of 5.66 mg/kg (fresh weight  reduction) was used as surrogate for the NOEC for determining 
risk for aquatic plants. Based on EUSES modelling (EUSES 2.1.1),  a PECSOIL was calculated using the 
calculated PECSW, finerenone physico-chemical parameters and default parameters from EUSES 
(v2.2.0).  The model estimations yielded a predicted environmental concentration (PECSOIL) of 0.00296-
0.00421  μg/kg soil based on wet weight.  Using the lowest NOEC-value in the terrestrial plant tests 
(EC20 of 5.66  mg/kg for Glycine max) and an assessment factor of 10,  a PNECSOIL of 0.566 mg/kg or 
566 μg/kg is derived. The corresponding RQ is therefore 0.7 x 10-5, suggesting that  no risk for the soil 
compartment is anticipated. 
Thus, collectively finerenone persistence and exposure at the proposed dosing may pose a risk to the 
aquatic and sediment organisms. Therefore, finerenone should be used according to the  precautions

2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) is not  expressed only in the kidney and the heart, but in  various 
tissues. In response to the questions in the first round of the procedure the applicant provided a 
presentation on what is known regarding the distribution  of the MR in  various tissues. Expression of 
the MR has been well described in heart, vasculature, kidneys and also in colon, brain, skin, lung, liver, 
skeletal muscle, salivary and sweat glands. The MR is expressed in various cell types; renal epithelial 
cells, epithelium of salivary and sweat glands and urinary bladder, glomerular cells, vascular smooth 
muscle cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, white  and brown adipocytes, keratinocytes, airway epithelia, 
macrophages and T-cells. MR expression has also been reported in ocular tissues, placenta, uterus, 
ovaries and testes. 
The applicant has also discussed the possible consequences of an on-target antagonistic  action by 
finerenone in relation to what  is observed in the  toxicity studies presented in this file. The identified 
target organs in  the repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats were adrenal, pituitary,  lacrimal glands, liver, 
kidney, urinary bladder, and female genital tract. In the studies in  dogs, adrenals and prostate were 
identified as target organs. Most  findings were considered to  be related to direct pharmacological 
effects or secondary adaptational effects.  
No information was presented on the binding  of finerenone to the MR in mouse or rabbit. Since both 
mouse and rabbits are used in toxicological studies, and the relevance of the species is primarily based 
on the availability of the target,  and action  on the  target in humans vs the specific animal, data on 
binding in  these species are also of importance. It  is acknowledged that  the mouse has been used in 
several of the presented pharmacodynamic in vivo studies and the  results indicate that  finerenone do 
have an activity at MR in  mouse. Furthermore, the results from the toxicity study,  further supports the 
mouse as a pharmacologically relevant species. The applicant was asked to provide data or a thorough 
Assessment report

justification on the  lack thereof on the binding  of finerenone to the MR in  mouse and rabbit. No data 
was presented however a thorough justification was presented including  affinity to MR with  aldosterone 
in rabbit and mouse preparations and presentations on sequence homologies of the receptors. The 
ligand binding pocket of the ligand binding domain of mouse and rabbit MR are 100%  homologous to 
rat and human MR the receptor, the  respective larger LBDs show a homology of >95%. Although  only 
indirect evidence of the binding of finerenone to MR,  it is considered that  rabbit and mouse are 
pharmacologically relevant as suitable species in the  assessment of finerenone. 
In the initial  submission no data or discussion on the  binding capacity of finerenone towards other 
steroid hormone receptors in the common experimental animals was presented. Since finerenone is 
claimed to  be selective, it  is for the  interpretation of the findings of interest to know if this is true also 
in the animal species in which  the pharmacological and toxicological studies are conducted. The 
applicant was therefore asked to discuss, and present data if available, the selectivity of finerenone in 
the investigated species. The applicant discussed and presented data on the sequences of the steroid 
hormone receptors which  are well conserved amongst species. The conclusion that  the high selectivity 
of finerenone towards the MR in comparison with  all human steroid hormone receptors should be 
applicable at least for all mammalian steroid hormone receptors, is agreed upon. 
The applicant was also asked to discuss if the relatively high doses administered in the in vivo 
pharmacological studies could have had an impact  on the  selectivity and pharmacological results. It is 
agreed that  pharmacologically expected results were seen at systemic exposures in the same range as 
in patients  treated with  20 mg finerenone once daily. 
Several of the studies included eplerenone as a comparative agent. While this  might be of interest from 
a clinical perspective it should be noted that as the compounds have different affinity to  the MR a 
dose-to-dose comparison would not  be relevant. This has been accounted for in some of the 
experiments. However, from these experiments it is not possible to draw any conclusions regarding the 
possible effectiveness of finerenone vs eplerenone (or spironolactone) in the clinical setting.   
It should be noted that  in many of the in vivo studies a relatively high dose of finerenone is 
administered. The 10  mg/kg dose used in many of the experiments for example, is also administered 
in the toxicological studies. In the 4-week toxicity study in  rats, the  10 mg/kg gives a multiple of 
exposure vs the clinical exposure of 1505 and 3122  times in male and female animals respectively 
based on the total  exposure. When comparing the unbound exposures, the multiples  are significantly 
lower, 8 for males and 17  for females. It is acknowledged that  to achieve statistically significant  results 
in this  kind of animal models, of which some are induced by surgical interventions, with  the relatively 
small number of animals, higher doses might be needed. Nevertheless, the  used clinically non-relevant 
doses should be taken into  consideration when interpreting  the details of the results and when 
comparing with  other compounds already in clinical use. Furthermore, with  the high doses, finerenone 
might  bind to the other steroid receptors and the  action on the mineralocorticoid receptor could thus 
be less specific than what is claimed.  
Finerenone displays a different binding  to mineralocorticoid receptors when compared to spironolactone 
and eplerenone. Finerenone acts an inverse agonist, whereas spironoloactone acts as a partial agonist. 
The  applicant  was  in  the  first  round  of  the  procedure asked  to  give  an  explanation  why  the  different 
binding  sites  and  functional  effects of  finerenone on the  mineralocorticoid receptor when  compared to 
steroidal  mineralocorticoid  receptor  antagonists 
(spironolactone,  eplerenone) 
lead  to 
lower 
hyperkalaemia  when  given  on  top  of  ACE  inhibitors  or  AT1  receptor  antagonists.  In  response,  the 
applicant  has  provided  a  discussion  on  the  difference between  finerenone  as  an  inverse  agonist  and 
spironolactone  as  a  partial  agonist  and  the  effects  on  hyperkalaemia. A  plausible  explanation  is  the 
difference in  recruitment  of  transcriptional  co-factors due  to  different  chemical structures  and  binding 
modes (‘bulky’ vs ‘planar’). The modulation of MR by cofactors is identified as a factor of differential gene

expressions,  were  finerenone  vs  spironolactone  or  eplerenone  has  been  shown  to  more  overall 
pronounced  antifibrotic  efficacy.  The  exact  molecular  mechanism  describing  how  finerenone  could 
differently modulate urinary potassium levels is not known. However, the different effects on renal pro-
fibrotic gene expression is likely part of the difference observed with the compounds in different models. 
See further discussion in section on Clinical Pharmacology. 
Overall, administration of finerenone in the different studies resulted in MR-antagonising  effects with  a 
beneficial/ protective effect on heart and kidneys in rodents. According to the  applicant, finerenone has 
properties which  include less risk for hyperkalaemia in comparison to spironolactone and eplerenone. 
In the clinical section, the applicant is asked to further explain the  mechanistic basis for this beneficial 
mode of action. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics of finerenone has primarily been investigated in vivo in rat and dog with some 
additional studies in mouse and monkey. Rabbit was also included in studies on plasma protein 
binding, blood cell/plasma partitioning  and drug metabolism and compared to human data. Possible 
drug-drug interactions were also analysed and is evaluated as part of the clinical assessment. 
Nonclinical pharmacokinetics is considered sufficiently characterised and show that  the toxicological 
species used are acceptable and relevant to use. No human specific metabolite was detected. Large 
species difference in the free fraction in plasma, with  higher levels in  humans, suggests that  this 
should be considered when exposure margins are calculated.  
Toxicology 
A full programme of toxicity studies has been performed to evaluate the toxicity profile of the 
substance. The programme was comprised of general toxicology studies and studies of genotoxicity, 
carcinogenicity, reproductive toxicity and phototoxicity. The study programme also included three 
studies in juvenile animals (one single dose TK study, one systemic toxicity study and one juvenile 
toxicity study focused on female fertility).  While these studies have been included and assessed in this 
assessment report, they are outside the scope of the present application. 
Because of the  mineralocorticoid receptor blockade MoA of finerenone, a compensatory hypertrophy of 
the zona glomerulosa (the site of aldosterone synthesis in the adrenal cortex) was seen in all species 
(graded minimal-extensive) from the lowest doses. In the  4-week study in rats, vacuoles in the zona 
fasciculata are reported only in the recovery animals. It was unclear what these vacuoles are 
composed of, and the applicant was asked to clarify the intracellular accumulation and deposition that 
resulted in the vacuoles. Based on the described morphology of the discussed findings  in the report, 
the vacuoles are considered by the applicant composed of lipids. Further,  the applicant suggests that a 
possible mechanism for the increase of vacuoles in the zona fasciculata could be extensive activation of 
the zona glomerulosa resulting in an increased production of corticosterone and aldosterone. 
In male dogs, chronic administration (up to 39-weeks) of finerenone resulted in  reduced prostate size 
and weight starting  at 1.5 mg/kg/day which correlated with  reduced size of prostate at necropsy in one 
male at  1.5mg/kg/day and 2 males at  5mg/kg/day. The prostate had not  been a target organ of 
toxicity in the 4-  and 13-week studies, suggesting that  longer-term exposures are required for the 
development. While no supporting histopathology findings  were noted this  is still  considered treatment 
related and possibly clinically relevant as the MoE  is only 10.  Accordingly, the applicant was asked to 
include the findings in  section 5.3  of the  SmPC. In the response, the applicant agreed that  the low 
margin of exposure for the prostate finding in the dog to human clinical exposure may suggest a 
clinical relevance. However, it was the applicant’s view that the  limited effect size (in terms of absolute 
prostate weight change), the lack of clear progression with  increased dose and the identification  of the 
prostate finding in only a subset of the  animals suggests limited clinical relevance. While it was agreed 
Assessment report  
EMA/78746/2022  
Page 48/159 
 
 
 
that  the effect size was not great, the lack of dose-response was not  considered a valid argument in 
this case. The finding  was only identified in the  39-week study, was considered adverse by the study 
pathologist and had limited margins to clinical exposure at NOAEL and LOAEL. Further,  as no recovery 
group was used in the  study, the potential for recovery is not known. As finerenone treatment is a 
chronic treatment it was also not clear if the effects would progress with  longer treatment. The 
applicant agreed to include the finding  in section 5.3 of the SmPC and proposed an update of the 
repeated dose toxicity paragraph. This text  was edited by the Assessor to reflect that  the relevance of 
the finding  is unclear. Further clinical development of the product may clarify to what  extent the 
prostate is a target of toxicity also in human. According to the  applicant, the MR antagonist  eplerenone 
also caused prostate weight reduction in dogs, but in  addition caused atrophy. For eplerenone, a mild 
hormonal imbalance was identified  as the most likely cause for the  changes, why it  is possible that  a 
similar explanation holds true also for finerenone.  
In the mouse carcinogenicity study, macroscopic examinations revealed enlargement and/or a pale 
area of the testes in several male mice from 3mg/kg/day. This correlated microscopically with 
increased incidence of Leydig cell adenoma in males administered 30  mg/kg/day when compared to 
both study control groups and the Covance historical control data in  mice of this strain. The adenomas 
were present unilaterally in all animals, and (except in one case) only in animals surviving to  terminal 
sacrifice suggesting a late occurrence. In combination with  the lack of genotoxic effects of finerenone, 
this supports that  the finding  is likely an indirect effect perhaps related to hormonal perturbation. 
However, the  applicant was asked to  further support this issue. As MR are expressed in rat testes 
(selectively localised to Leydig cells) and aldosterone increases testosterone production in Leydig cells, 
the applicant suggests that  blocking of the MR  by finerenone may reduce testosterone production in 
Leydig cells. This blocking may then  increase LH secretion (from the pituitary)  to increase testosterone 
production. While this  sequence of events is possible, available data do not support reduced hormone 
levels in the carcinogenicity studies. Therefore, the applicant suggests that  the findings  were only an 
enhancement of spontaneous age-related changes. While the  findings in the control group may 
represent background findings,  the clear increase in pale area and/or macroscopic enlargement of the 
testis in males administered 3, 10,  or 30  mg/kg/day, and a statistically significant increased incidence 
of Leydig cell adenoma in the  testis of males administered 30  mg/kg/day are considered finerenone-
induced effects. However, given the  known susceptibility  of rodents to develop adenomas, differences 
in the number of LH and LH-related  aging changes and the fact that  the increase in adenoma findings 
were only noted with  a MoE of 22x to human clinical exposure the clinical relevance is uncertain. Still, 
the findings are reflected in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Thus, collectively chronic toxicity and carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice have shown that  the 
administration of finerenone had effects on genital organs and reproductive tissue. Due to the 
pronounced species difference in the  extent of plasma protein binding (about 92 % in humans, >> 99 
% in mice and rats), the determination of the free plasma concentration of finerenone in the rodent 
toxicity studies is difficult,  why the determination of safety margins based on unbound  plasma 
concentrations is uncertain. Nevertheless, the gonadal effects observed in rodents seem to occur at 
free plasma concentrations only slightly above therapeutically effective free plasma concentrations in 
humans. The applicant was asked to give an explanation for the mechanism of the gonadal effects 
observed after administration of finerenone in rodents and its therapeutic relevance to humans, taking 
into account that,  in contrast to  spironolactone, finerenone up to 10  µM has no effects on androgen 
and progesterone receptors. In the  response, the applicant agreed that the  free fraction in rodents was 
much lower than in humans with  0.047%  in rats, and 0.077%  in mice compared to roughly 8% in 
humans. Thus, in combination with  the inherent difficulty in  accurately measuring the free 
concentrations at such high protein binding,  it is possible that  the MoE  is underestimated. However, 
when comparing the  given protein binding  data with  pharmacology data from the 2-  and 4-week 
studies in rat, it  is the applicant’s view that  this  is not  the case. While the approach taken by the 
Assessment report  
EMA/78746/2022  
Page 49/159 
 
 
 
applicant may have its merits, the reliability of the  safety margins are still considered unclear. 
However, this  is an inherent problem with  high protein-binding  drugs as such. Regarding the potential 
mechanisms underlying the effects on gonads, the applicant has provided with  discussions all focusing 
on the antagonism of finerenone on the MR. Considering the selective binding properties towards this 
receptor, mechanisms along these lines are considered likely. Still,  to further delineate a molecular 
sequence of events additional studies would  be of interest. However, at this point,  such studies are not 
considered needed. 
For both rat and rabbit, DRF-studies were performed prior to the conduct  of the  pivotal EFD  studies. In 
the rat EFD study, at  30mg/kg/day, one foetus displayed several malformations, including double 
aortic arch, septal defects and further heart and vessel malformations, reduced spleen size and 
malformed lung. It is noted that  a similar malformation was evident in  one foetus in the DRF-study.  As 
no data had been made available from the DRF-study, it  was however difficult  to further evaluate 
similarities between the findings. The applicant was therefore asked to further discuss these 
malformations. The applicant gave a very limited discussion of the  double aortic arch noted in two 
finerenone-treated foetuses. While it is curious that such a finding occurs twice in a development 
programme, it is agreed with  the applicant that  the significance is unclear. In the rabbit EFD study, 
forelimbs were malrotated in 11  foetuses of finerenone treated dams but  no control foetuses had this 
malformation. Even if the applicant declared that  this finding  may occur spontaneously in the rabbit 
strain used and that  the incidences (3.8 % affected foetuses, 23.5 % affected litters) lay inside the 
normal range of scattering, the treatment-relation cannot be completed excluded. According to the 
study report, this finding may occur spontaneously in the rabbit strain used and malposition of the 
forelimb(s), which does not  include skeletal changes, is the most common spontaneous malformation 
in the rabbit strain used and is caused most likely by restriction of foetal movement in the uterus. 
Further, the  study report suggests that  3.8 % affected foetuses (23.5 % affected litters) lay inside the 
normal range of scattering (up to 5.9 % affected foetuses, up to  31.25 % affected litters with 
malposition of forelimb). While it  seems to be a spontaneous finding in  the rabbits used (based on the 
historical control data provided) the most recent historical control data (2010)  suggests an incidence of 
0.9%.  Also, while not  a clear dose-response effect, the  effect is clearly finerenone treatment related 
given the lack of findings in the control group.  The applicant was therefore asked to further elaborate 
on the significance of the  malpositioned forelimb findings and reflect on why finerenone exposure leads 
to restricted movement in the  uterus. The applicant elaborated on the  significance of the malpositioned 
forelimb and also provided with  plausible explanations for the restricted movement in the  uterus. The 
malposition of the forelimb is by the applicant considered a relatively common deformation rather than 
a malformation, which  is exacerbated by the finerenone treatment at 0.75  mg/kg/day. It is agreed that 
there is a finerenone-relation in the  finding and that  the Himalayan rabbit is prone to develop these 
malpositions. The applicant further suggested, based on Palmer (1978), that  these effects can occur 
with  drugs which reduced the amniotic fluid  volume. While only indirect inference can be made, based 
on the PD of finerenone, an indirect effect on amniotic fluid volume is possible but has not been shown. 
Still, given that  roughly one foetus per litter  was affected (in the affected litters) and the variation in 
PD symptoms of the dams (e.g. dehydration) it would  be expected that  the females with  the most 
severe symptoms would generate the foetuses with  the malpositioned forelimbs. It is not clear if this  is 
the case. The questions were posed if the foetal position within  the uterine horn affect the outcome of 
the foetal forelimb malposition and also to what extent are these findings reversible postnatally. The 
applicant was therefore asked to further elaborate on the findings and include detailed descriptions of 
the findings.  In the  response, the applicant stated that  the malpositioned forelimbs noted in the rabbit 
EFD-study with  1(1),  5(5) and 5(4)  feetuses (litters) showing  the deviation at  0.25, 0.75  and 2,5 
mg/kg/day respectively, was a spontaneous background finding. This was not  fully agreed. While the 
particular strain of rabbit (Himalayan rabbit) shows a relatively high (but  very variable over time) 
background incidence of the  finding in the performing site,  the lack of such deviations in the  control

group suggests a treatment  relation. The applicant further clarified that  the finding  was confined to the 
ventral flexure of the forelimb at the region of the  wrist (i.e. carpal flexure) without  any associated 
skeletal findings.  Further, the applicant stated that  the flexures resolve spontaneously in a short time 
and are therefore not adverse. This latter conclusion is in part derived from a publication from DeSesso 
and Scialli (2018)  where the authors further suggest that more appropriate classification for carpal 
flexure with  normal skeletal anatomy in rabbits is that  of (reversible) deformation. While  it can be 
agreed that  the finding (as described) is not considered adverse as it  likely resolves postnatally, the 
deformation was still  considered treatment related but  of minor clinical relevance. 
In the PPND-study, 3 pups were stillborn  at 10mg/kg/day, and 1 stillborn  pup with a deformed head 
was found in the 1mg/kg/day group. Further,  pinna unfolding was significantly later in pups to mothers 
exposed at 10mg/kg/day, which  is an indication of developmental toxicity. Also, behaviour 
assessments in the F1-generation  on PND 28  evidenced increased counts in  all parameters of 
locomotor activity (total  activity, mobile counts and rears) in rats to mothers exposed to finerenone at 
3mg/kg/day or higher. Collectively, the DART programme evidenced reproductive toxicity including 
malformations and still-births  with  low margins to clinical exposure. These findings are not compatible 
with  a safe finerenone use during  pregnancy and lactation,  and the substance should not be used by 
women of reproductive age not using appropriate contraception. This is reflected in  the updated 
version of the SmPC section 4.6. along with  qualitative descriptions with  margins to clinical exposure 
based on NOAEL in  section 5.3.   
In  the  juvenile  toxicity  study,  the  epididymis,  seminal  vesicles  and  prostate  weights  (among  other 
organs)  are  reduced  at  10mg/kg/day  after  recovery.  General  toxicology  findings  of  reduced 
prostate  weights  and  other  effects  on  male and  female  genitals  have  been seen  in  the  programme, 
where  “a mild hormonal imbalance” has been suggested as a possible explanation for the effects. With 
this in  mind, the applicant was therefore asked to further discuss this finding. According to the 
applicant, the weights  of the  male reproductive organs never differed significantly when the 
comparisons relative to bodyweight were made (data not included in  the response). Further, at the  end 
of the recovery phase the control groups showed a higher body weight and the high  dose males had a 
slightly lower body weight  which according to  the applicant is likely a chance finding.  When 
bodyweights are considered unreliable, other relative comparisons are frequently seen, e.g. relative to 
brain weight. The applicant was thus asked to  provide additional relative comparisons of the 
reproductive organs to  increase clarity. In the response, the applicant clarified the  mean weights  of 
male sex organs both in relation to body weight and also for brain weight.  Regarding the prostate 
weights, a single control individual had an unusually high  weight, which  was likely the result of a 
technical mistake. The other relatively small differences in sex organ weights  (including the epididymes 
weights) were not considered to be related to  finerenone treatment. Further,  3 histiocytic sarcomas 
were encountered at terminal sacrifice in 3 animals in the study (2 males at  3mg/kg/day  and one 
female at 10mg/kg/day). The tumours had already spread to several organs and caused the moribund 
condition of one animal. A treatment-relation was not assumed by the applicant  and these animals 
were excluded from all data tables. However, histiocytic sarcoma is the most frequent haematopoietic 
tumour in rats, but  rarely occurs before 12 months of age (doi:  10.1293/tox.23.161).  It is 
characterised by the  proliferation of malignant cells that have the  morphological and 
immunohistochemical characteristics of mature tissue histiocytes. The tumour cells have a typical 
histiocytic appearance. Based on literature, the cytoplasm is relatively broad and eosinophilic and may 
contain vacuoles or phagocytised erythrocytes (doi:10.1007/978-3-642-84110-1_7).  The  applicant 
was  thus  asked to  further  comment  on the  sarcoma  findings  in  relation  to  the  age of  the  rats,  the 
exposure,  and  the  possible  association  of  the haematology  findings  in the  study  According to 
literature, genetic traits may influence the frequency of histiocytic sarcoma. The applicant describes 
that  two, and possibly all three cases in the study were siblings and therefore suggests that  a genetic 
trait is the  most likely cause of the sarcomas. While there may be a genetic (likely polygenic) factor 
Assessment report

involved, it  is a neoplasm that may occur de novo or in the context of a previous haematologic 
malignancy (https://doi.org/10.3324/haematol.2019.230375).  We do not know why the sarcomas 
developed in these animals, and although  the cases were all in finerenone-treated groups it is not 
possible to  label the findings  as clearly treatment-related. No similar findings were evident in the 
repeated-dose toxicity studies or in the  carcinogenicity studies, except for one case in the control 
group of the  104-week study in  rat. It is unclear if any of his siblings were included in a finerenone-
treated group. In any case, the histiocytic  sarcomas identified in  three animals in the juvenile toxicity 
study are likely spurious findings with  unclear relation to  finerenone treatment. While  the  indication 
applied  for in  this  MAA  concerns  adults,  it  is  stressed  that  this  issue  should  be further  addressed  in 
the  event of  a future  application  for finerenone  in  a paediatric  population. 
A phototoxicity assessment of finerenone was performed, based on two GLP-compliant studies in the 
test facility. In the first 3T3-NRU  phototoxicity assay, considerable variability was seen, and the mean 
was over 5 (suggestive of a phototoxic effect). In the  second assay, a mean PIF of 1.8 resulted. The 
applicant was asked to explain why the  results in  the two studies were so different, considering that 
they were both  GLP-compliant and run at  the same test facility. Further,  a conclusion regarding the 
phototoxic potential of finerenone was asked for. The applicant provided with  an explanation for the 
variability in  test results for the two  performed GLP-compliant phototoxicity studies. Collectively the 
approach taken is agreed with and supports that  finerenone has no phototoxic potential. 
ERA 
Distribution studies  showed that  finerenone is primarily distributed  to the sediment compartment, and 
not degraded. Based on the data, finerenone has to be classified as very persistent (vP) in sediment. 
One major transformation product (M-1)  was detected which increased over time and accounted for 
more than  90 %AR at  the end of the  study. This indicates that  M-1  is also persistent. 
Based on toxicity criteria for PBT assessments, finerenone is considered toxic for both fish and daphnia 
(NOEC<10ug/L).  Fish (fathead minnow) was the most sensitive species for finerenone aquatic effects, 
with  a NOEC of 0.00001  mg/L  (0.01µg/L)  but  based on refined (SimpleTreat) PEC values, the  RQ is 
<1. Based on sediment-dweller toxicity (OC10% NOEC ~46.1mg/kg  dw) and refined sediment PEC 
(0.12mg/kg dw),  there was also no indication of environmental risk to  sediment-dwellers (RQ<1).  
Due to  strong adsorption to  sludge, finerenone is likely to be distributed to soils. Due to  methodological 
challenges (in  OECD TG307), no DT50 could be determined for soils. Based on the data, it  is very likely 
that  finerenone is strongly adsorbed to  the soil matrix and likely persistent to  very persistent in soils. 
This speculation is supported by the very high Koc of 125.892.541L/kg.  In the terrestrial toxicity test 
battery, the most sensitive species was soybean (NOEC/LOEC  boundary around 10-12.3mg/kg with  a 
calculated EC20 of 5.66  mg/kg). Based on FOCUS guidance for assessing degradation/dissipation in 
various compartments, a default DT50 of 1000d  was used to calculate a soil PEC of (1 year and 
accumulated over 10 years), giving a RQ of 0.0061  (RQ<1). Based on this, there is no environmental 
risk for soil organisms.  
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
In conclusion, the applicant has provided with a comprehensive evaluation of the non-clinical 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology of finerenone. The issues identified in the non-clinical 
programme have been properly addressed. Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity which 
has been reflected in  the recommendations for finerenone use during pregnancy and lactation. Women 
of childbearing potential  should use effective contraception during finerenone treatment,  and the

substance should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition  of the woman requires 
treatment with  finerenone. Collectively, Kerendia is considered approvable from a non-clinical 
perspective.

Finerenone clinical development programme consisted of 28 Phase I clinical studies to obtain the 
necessary clinical pharmacology data including the elucidation of required pharmacokinetic (PK)

properties of finerenone. The overview of all completed Clinical Pharmacology studies is presented in 
Table 1  and Table 2 above.  
Clinical Pharmacology studies were categorised into “basic Phase 1 studies” including  a single dose 
escalation first-in-man  study, multiple dose escalation study and mass-balance study, 
“biopharmaceutical studies”,  “studies in special populations”  to evaluate the effects of intrinsic  factors 
on PK properties, drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies in which  finerenone was investigated as potential 
DDI victim (extrinsic factors) or perpetrator, and studies designed for specific purposes. 
In these Phase 1 clinical pharmacology studies, finerenone was mainly administered as a tablet, except 
for the single dose escalation study (Study 13782),  the  [14C] finerenone mass balance study (Study 
14502),  and the absolute bioavailability study (Study 16535),  in which either oral solutions or an 
intravenous (i.v.)  solution were administered instead of, or in addition to  the tablet. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods for the quantification of finerenone and its metabolites in plasma utilised the 
protein precipitation followed by high  performance liquid chromatography coupled with  tandem mass 
spectrometric detection (HPLC-MS/MS).  In urine, finerenone and its  metabolites were determined after 
10-fold dilution  with  human plasma and then applying the assays for plasma. 
For the sole determination of finerenone in  human plasma, methods were initially  developed for a 
concentration range from 0.1 to 200  μg/L (MW1398  and SBQ-13062).  For the determination of 
finerenone and its metabolites in plasma in one assay format, methods for a concentration range from 
0.1 to  500 μg/L  for finerenone and 0.5 to  500 μg/L for the metabolites were validated (MW1452  and 
SBQ-14068), very similar to the methods for sole quantitation  of finerenone. At a later stage of 
development some methods were transferred to a new generation of mass spectrometers and new 
method descriptions were filed accordingly (MW1921  based on MW1398,  MW1882  based on MW1452). 
Furthermore, a method for the determination of finerenone in the concentration range from 0.1 to  200 
μg/L  for a low plasma volume (e.g. from capillary blood) was validated (MW2007  based on MW1398). 
Like for plasma, urine assays were adapted over the course of development from a concentration 
range of 1.00  to 2000 μg/L  for finerenone (MW1398)  towards 1.00 to 5000  μg/L  and 5.00  to 5000  μg/L 
for finerenone and its  metabolites, respectively (MW1452,  SBQ-14069). 
Absorption  
Finerenone is almost completely absorbed after its  oral administration. Apparent permeability in vitro 
in Caco-2 cells was comparable to values obtained for highly permeable markers (metoprolol and 
propranolol), thus  implying that finerenone is a highly permeable compound. Furthermore, in  vitro 
studies have also revealed that finerenone acts as a P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrate. However, due to 
its high  permeability, the impact of efflux transporters on the in vivo absorption of finerenone is 
considered negligible. 
Mass-balance study conducted with  radiolabelled finerenone [14C] finerenone has implied a complete 
absorption of finerenone (Study 14502).  Of note, considering its high permeability and a low solubility, 
finerenone could be regarded as a BCS (Biopharmaceutical Classification System) Class 2 compound. 
Despite its  almost complete absorption, in a dedicated clinical study (Study 16535)  the absolute 
bioavailability (BA) of finerenone was measured to be around 43.5%.  This is attributed  to the  first-pass 
metabolism of finerenone that  takes place in both gut-wall  and liver. 
Overall, the absorption of finerenone was rapid with  Tmax appearing between 0.5 and 1.25  h after 
tablet intake in fasting conditions.  The food (i.e. high-fat  high calorie meal) led to an increase in AUC

(+ 21%)  and reduction in  Cmax (-19%) of finerenone compared to fasting conditions.  However, the 
resulting changes in the finerenone exposure are not considered as clinically relevant and therefore 
finerenone tablets can be taken regardless of mealtime. 
Distribution 
Study 16535  which investigated the absolute BA of finerenone included the administration of i.v. 
infusion of aqueous solution  (containing either 0.25, 0.5  and 1 mg finerenone) over 1h. Based on the 
PK data from this study,  the calculated Vss of finerenone was between 52.6  and 66.9  L (geometric 
mean values). Thus, the calculated Vss of finerenone of 52.6 L is similar to the volume of total  body 
water (0.6 * mean body weight  of study subjects = 48.4  L). 
The plasma protein binding of finerenone was determined by the ultrafiltration.  The unbound fraction 
(%), fu in  human was 8.3%.  Most of the drug in human plasma was bound to the albumin fraction. 
Moreover, finerenone was similarly distributed  between the  red blood cells and plasma with the  blood-
to-plasma ratio of about 0.94  in human. 
Elimination 
Finerenone is rapidly eliminated from plasma with a terminal elimination half-life between 2 to 3 h, a 
value observed in the dose range of finerenone up to 20 mg.  
CYP3A4 is a major enzyme responsible for about 90% metabolism of finerenone, while CYP2C8 has a 
minor role contributing  to about 10%  of finerenone metabolism. Drug undergoes extensive first-pass 
metabolism in the gut-wall  and liver. 
Plasma clearance of finerenone determined after its i.v. administration (study 16535)  was in a range 
between 22.3 to  31.4 L/h.  Plasma CL of 22.3 L/h is equivalent to a blood CL of 24.8  L/h (i.e. based on 
a Cb/Cp ratio of 0.9)  and this  systemic blood CL value is reported in  the SmPC. 
Mass-balance study 
Mass-balance study was conducted to measure the cumulative amount as well as the  time course of 
drug-related, radiolabelled material excreted in the urine and faeces following a single dose of 10  mg 
[14C] finerenone (oral solution),  and to characterize the metabolite pattern in plasma, urine, and 
faeces.

Figure 2. Concentrations of finerenone (µg/L) and total radioactivity (μg-eq/L) in plasma after 
administration of [14C] finerenone 10 mg aqueous solution; (geometric means and SD – 
semilogarithmic scale; N=4). 
The mean recovery of total radioactivity in the excreta urine and faeces was 101%  (range: 88.0%-
106%).  About 79.6% (range: 76.2%-83.3%)  of the radioactivity was excreted via urine, while 21.2% 
(range: 9.6%-26.9%)  of the radioactivity was excreted via faeces. Unchanged finerenone represented 
about ~1%  of the administered dose in faeces and urine. 
The AUC of finerenone (determined by LC-MS/MS)  accounted for only about 7% of the AUC of total 
radioactivity in  plasma after administration of [14C] finerenone. Furthermore, based on the total 
radioactivity AUC in plasma, metabolite M-1 represented 48.9%,  metabolite M-2  represented 21.5%, 
metabolite M-3  represented 9.0%, metabolite M-4  represented 2.4%, and metabolite M-5 represented 
1.4% of total  radioactivity. In summary, based on total  plasma radioactivity AUC >90%  of the 
radioactivity could be assigned to  known chemical structures. 
Table 4. Total radioactivity in plasma (%) for finerenone and its metabolites from a mass-balance 
study. 
Furthermore, detailed investigations revealed that  the predominant human plasma metabolites M-1,  M-
2, and M-3  exhibited an axial chirality as pairs of atropisomers, each consisting of an "a"-  and "b"-
series (see figure below). Further analysis of plasma showed the predominant appearance of the 
atropisomers of the a-series, with  the following “a” to “b” ratios M-1a  : M-1b =  79 : 21; M-2a  : M-2b = 
95 : 5;  M-3a : M-3b  = 99 : 1. Based on these percentages, metabolites M-1a (38.8%),  M-1b  (10.1%) 
and M-2a (20.3%)  were regarded as the major human plasma metabolites. In addition,  metabolite M-
3a was also regarded as a major plasma metabolite by the applicant,  based on the study conducted in 
patients with  impaired renal function (Study 14509),  in which  M3 metabolite represented about 30%  of 
total drug-related plasma exposure.

involved in the biotransformation of finerenone. 
Additionally, the applicant has conducted two in vitro studies addressing different aspects of the 
finerenone metabolism by implementing  incubations in liver microsomes and hepatocytes of different 
species. In vitro data indicated no significant species differences, and no human-specific pathways in 
the in vitro metabolism of finerenone. Turnover of [14C] finerenone in human microsomal incubations 
was about 93%, while in  human hepatocytes (2 h incubation  period) it  was between 44-52%. 
Furthermore, in vitro CYP phenotyping data indicated that  CYP3A4 is the most  relevant enzyme in the 
biotransformation of finerenone, followed by CYP2C8. The hepatic fraction metabolised by CYP3A4 is 
estimated to be ≥ 80%. According to the applicant, glucuronides were not observed neither of the 
parent nor of the metabolites, i.e. no UGT enzyme contribution.   
Finally, the  major contribution of CYP3A4 enzyme in the metabolism of finerenone as well as the minor 
role of CYP2C8 enzyme are confirmed in the  respective in vivo DDI “victim” studies. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose-proportionality 
The applicant has conducted several clinical Phase I studies implementing different doses of finerenone 
which allowed for the estimation of its dose-proportionality. Study 13782 was the first-in-man study 
which investigated finerenone PK with  increasing single oral doses of 1, 2.5,  5, 10, 20  and 40  mg 
administered as a PEG solution.  This study overall indicated a dose-proportional increase in finerenone 
AUC and a slightly  less than dose-proportional increase in its  Cmax. 
Furthermore, there were several Phase I studies using different doses of finerenone tablets with 
additional treatment arms addressing different aspects of bioavailability. Study 15481 investigated the 
PK of finerenone administered as single oral doses as tablets  of 1.25,  2.5, 5,  7.5 and 10 mg, while the 
study 16536 included finerenone tablets of 10 and 20 mg. Both studies have implied a dose-
proportional increase in finerenone AUC and Cmax within its proposed therapeutic range (i.e. doses up 
to 20 mg).  Moreover, studies 13784 and 15113 have also included investigation of finerenone PK 
Assessment report  
EMA/78746/2022

given as tablets at its  supratherapeutic dose of 80  mg (i.e. 4-fold higher than the highest proposed 
therapeutic dose of 20 mg) which  also implied a dose-proportional PK. Overall, the  applicant has 
sufficiently demonstrated the  dose-proportional PK properties of finerenone given as single dose 
tablets in the  dose range from 1.25 up to  80 mg. 
Time-dependency 
Clinical study 13785 involved multiple oral doses of 10 mg twice daily (BID), 20 mg BID and 40 mg 
OD of finerenone given over a period of ten days. However, none of the dosing regimens which  were 
implemented in this study was reflecting the actually proposed finerenone posology (i.e. 10 or 20 mg 
OD). The corresponding ratios of drug exposure observed at day 10  (AUCtau, ss) and after its  first dose 
(AUC0-infinity) denoted as RLIN implied a time-dependent PK of finerenone. RLIN ratios have implied a 
slight  increase in finerenone exposure after its repeated dosing with  RLIN of 110%  (i.e. +10%)  after OD 
dosing, and even higher increase of 120-132%  (i.e. +  20-32%) after BID dosing regimens. Moreover, 
similar tendencies towards the time-dependent PK were also observed in studies conducted in Chinese 
(study 16537) and Japanese (study 15171) population. 
When considering the  relatively short half-life of finerenone of 2-3 h as well as the OD dosing regimen, 
the observed increase in AUC after multiple dosing of finerenone would not  be expected. However, the 
applicant believes that  the reason for the  observed time-dependencies in finerenone PK might be the 
time-dependent inhibition  (TDI) of CYP3A4 for which  finerenone is a substrate.  
Overall, the auto-inhibition  appears a plausible explanation based on the  observed in vitro signals for 
TDI of CYP3A4, as well as based on the obtained in vivo DDI data with  midazolam (study  15111) in 
which a slight  inhibitory effect was observed (about +10% increase in midazolam AUC). 
Special populations 
Renal Impairment (RI) 
Study 14509 (Report PH-36810)  investigated the  impact of renal impairment (RI) on the PK of 
finerenone (given once as 10 mg tablet) and its  major metabolites M-1, M-2  and M-3.  Results have 
indicated that  the mild RI had no impact on the PK of finerenone. However, moderate and severe RI 
led to an (similar) increase in total finerenone AUC by 34% and 36%, respectively. No RI impact on 
the Cmax of finerenone was observed. Considering that  finerenone is primarily eliminated via 
metabolism (i.e. <1% of dose eliminated as unchanged finerenone via urine) the observed increase in 
the finerenone exposure in moderate and severe RI is likely due to the RI impact on other non-renal 
routes of drug elimination.

Table 5. Study 14509 – PK parameters of total finerenone in plasma and urine following a single 
dose of one 10 mg finerenone tablet (geometric mean/%CV [range]; N=33; and excluding outlier, 
N=32). 
Hepatic Impairment (HI) 
Study 14510 (Report PH-38432)  investigated the  impact of hepatic impairment (HI)  on the  PK of 
finerenone (given once as 5 mg tablet) and its inactive major metabolites M-1,  M-2  and M-3.  There 
was no significant increase in the finerenone exposure (neither as total AUCtot nor unbound AUC,u) in 
the subjects with  mild HI (Child Pugh A). On the other hand, in subjects with  moderate HI (Child Pugh 
B) there was an increase in AUCtot by 38% compared to healthy volunteers, and even a higher increase 
in AUCu by 55%  compared to healthy volunteers. This higher increase in unbound AUC is likely a 
consequence of lower albumin levels which  led to  slightly higher unbound fractions (fu) compared to 
healthy volunteers. A trend towards prolonged t1/2 was also observed with HI. Cmax was not affected by 
HI and was similar in  all studied  groups.  
There are no clinical PK data available in subjects with  severe HI (Child Pugh C). However, it  is 
anticipated that  the finerenone exposure for these patients  will exceed the therapeutic exposure range 
and as such the  applicant’s proposal to avoid treatment in  severe HI patients is supported in general. 
Age and gender 
Study 14508 (Report PH-36801)  investigated the  influence of both, age and gender on the PK of 
finerenone (and its metabolites) given as 10  mg tablet single dose in the fasted state. According to the 
ANOVA analysis performed in study 14508, the  gender did not appear to influence the PK of 
finerenone. On the other hand, age appeared to have statistically significant influence on PK with an 
increase in both AUC and Cmax (34% and 51%,  respectively) in elderly subjects (≥65  years) compared 
to younger study subjects (≤ 45  years). However, this increase was not considered as clinically 
relevant, and dose adjustments are not required in elderly patients  according to the  proposed 
recommendations in 4.2 section of the SmPC.

Race 
The applicant has conducted three Phase I studies in subjects with  Asian ethnicity:  Study 15528 
Single dose escalation in  Singapore Chinese subjects; Study 15171 (Report PH-36979)  Multiple  dose 
escalation in  Japanese subjects; Study 16537 (Report PH-40466)  Multiple  dose escalation study in 
mainland Chinese subjects. Based on the integrated analysis of Phase I available data, the Asian 
subjects exhibited a tendency towards the higher finerenone exposures compared to Caucasian 
subjects. However, this  difference was greatly reduced by normalisation to body weight, thus 
indicating  the large contribution  of the  lower body weight in Asian subjects. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Investigations of DDIs with  finerenone involved several in vitro, in silico and in vivo studies. 
• 
Finerenone as “perpetrator” drug 
For the purpose of in vitro DDI evaluations, the applicant has reported the maximum plasma 
concentration (Cmax) of finerenone with  the proposed therapeutic dose (i.e. 20  mg given once daily) to 
be 161 µg/L  which corresponds to 0.43 µM  (MW=378.42  g/mol). Furthermore, reported fraction 
unbound for finerenone in human plasma was about 8.33%.  Therefore, the systemic concentration cut-
off for the in  vitro investigation of DDI potential  is 0.0833 * 0.43  µM  = 0.035 µM.  Finally,  when taking 
into account the  EMA safety factor of 50,  the calculated systemic concentration cut-off is 50 x Cmax, u = 
50 * 0.035  µM  = 1.75 µM.  Furthermore, the  corresponding concentration EMA  cut-off for the  intestinal 
exposure is estimated to  be 21.1 µM,  while the hepatic-inlet  exposure was 7.29 µM. 
All in vitro studies have included sufficiently high finerenone concentrations (as “perpetrator” drug) 
covering EMA’s concentration cut-off values as calculated above, and therefore in  vitro perpetrator 
studies appear adequate in  this regard. 
Overall, in vitro results have implied that finerenone acts as an inhibitor of CYP3A4 enzyme, both as a 
direct and as time-dependent inhibitor  (TDI). Furthermore, finerenone inhibited  in vitro CYP2C8, 
CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 enzymes. Finally,  finerenone also demonstrated an induction of CYP3A4 in  vitro. 
The potential clinical relevance of these in vitro signals was further investigated in corresponding 
clinical DDI studies. The perpetrator impact on CYP3A4 enzymes in terms of both induction  and 
inhibition  was excluded in studies 15111  and 13785 with  midazolam as a CYP3A4 probe substrate, in 
which no relevant change in midazolam exposure was observed. Furthermore, clinical studies with 
repaglinide as CYP2C8 substrate (study 16541),  and warfarin as CYP2C9 substrate (study 14503)  have 
ruled out an inhibitory impact of finerenone on these CYP enzymes in vivo. 
Assessment report  
EMA/78746/2022

When it comes to transporters, finerenone has exhibited an inhibitory potential in vitro towards P-gp 
(IC50=47 µM),  BCRP (IC50=17.4 µM) and OATP1B1 (IC50=3.2 µM)  transporters. The clinical relevance 
of P-gp inhibition  was excluded by a clinical study with digoxin (study 14505)  which  showed no 
difference in digoxin exposure with and without  the concomitant  administration of finerenone. 
Inhibition  of OATP1B1 transporters was also ruled out by the clinical data from repaglinide study (i.e. 
study 16541  which was also used for CYP2C8 inhibition  purposes). Furthermore, the applicant  has 
conducted additional clinical DDI study (Study 21429;  completed and presented after the initial 
marketing authorisation  application submission) with  rosuvastatin as a “victim”  drug representing a 
substrate of both BCRP and OATPs, which  confirmed no DDI risk with  finerenone as a potential 
transporter inhibitor. 
• 
Finerenone as “victim”  drug 
The key role of CYP3A4 enzyme in the  elimination of finerenone was confirmed in two clinical DDI 
studies with  moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors  erythromycin (study 14504)  and verapamil (study 16910). 
Erythromycin led to a 3.5-fold increase in AUC of finerenone, and 1.9-fold increase in Cmax. Verapamil 
led to a 2.7-fold increase in AUC of finerenone, and 2.2-fold increase in Cmax. In addition, clinical study 
with  gemfibrozil (CYP2C8 inhibitor)  showed no relevant increase in finerenone AUC nor Cmax (i.e. 1.10- 
and 1.16-fold, respectively), which confirmed the minor role of CYP2C8 enzyme in  the metabolism of 
finerenone. 
The applicant has developed a PBPK DDI model for finerenone as a “victim”  drug via CYP3A4, to 
investigate non-studied DDI scenarios, i.e. concomitant use of finerenone with  weak and strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitors as well  as the concomitant  use with  moderate and strong CYP3A4 inducers. 
The PBPK analysis was conducted using the software PK-Sim® and MoBi® as part of the Open Systems 
Pharmacology Suite (OSPS version 9.)  and Matlab (version R2017b).  The predictive performance of the 
PBPK platform for the  intended purpose (i.e. prediction of CYP3A4 “victim” studies)  was assessed via a 
network of PBPK models of selected index CYP3A4 DDI perpetrators and respective sensitive index 
CYP3A4 victim drugs (midazolam, triazolam, alprazolam, alfentanil)  and a comprehensive dataset from 
published clinical DDI studies (see figure below).

Figure 6. Qualification of the PBPK platform: Predicted vs. observed mean AUCR for all 
combinations of DDI in the established CYP3A4 network (dotted lines representing a 2-fold 
difference). 
After the qualification of the PBPK platform step, the verification step of DDI model was performed by 
comparing the  predicted data for finerenone with concomitant  erythromycin and verapamil versus the 
clinically observed data from erythromycin (study 14504) and verapamil (study 16910)  DDI study. The 
predictive performance of finerenone “victim” DDI inhibition  model appeared adequate in terms of both 
AUCR and CmaxR for both perpetrator drugs erythromycin and verapamil (see table below). 
After the model verification step, the applicant has proceeded with PBPK model application step, to 
predict other non-studied DDI scenarios with  finerenone as a “victim” drug via CYP3A4 enzyme. 
According to the  prediction of the applied PBPK model, fluvoxamine as a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor led to 
an AUCR of 1.57  and CmaxR of 1.38.  These predicted numerical values are supported and are included 
in the finerenone SmPC. 
Furthermore, the PBPK model has predicted a significant  increase in finerenone exposure when given 
together with  strong CYP3A4 inhibitors  itraconazole and clarithromycin (see table below). However, it 
is worth emphasizing that  the highest finerenone dose (supratherapeutic dose) studied in a clinical 
setting  was 80  mg (i.e. 4-fold higher than  its highest proposed therapeutic dose of 20 mg), while the 
PBPK model predicts an increase of 6-fold which falls outside of the clinically studied  range of 
finerenone exposure. Therefore, due to uncertainties in  the PBPK model prediction which  goes beyond 
the clinically studied exposure for finerenone, the  predicted numerical values for strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors are removed from the initially proposed SmPC text.  Importantly, the SmPC contraindication 
text regarding the  concomitant use of strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is generally supported, because a high 
DDI impact can be expected based on the fact that  finerenone acts as a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate. 
Finally, the  applicant has also applied the  same PBPK model to  predict the  magnitude of finerenone 
interaction with  CYP3A4 inducers rifampicin (strong CYP3A4 inducer) and efavirenz (moderate CYP3A4 
inducer). However, the number of selected compounds was considered insufficient  to qualify the PBPK 
platform for the  intended purpose, i.e. CYP3A4 induction  prediction. Furthermore, there were no 
clinically observed data available with  finerenone as a “victim” of CYP3A4 induction in order to verify 
Assessment report

the model predictive performance. Therefore, PBPK predicted numerical values for CYP3A4 inducers 
were considered unreliable and removed from the initially proposed SmPC text.  Importantly, it is 
agreed that  the expected magnitude of interaction between finerenone and strong and moderate 
CYP3A4 inducers is high when considering the elimination pathway of finerenone and the key role of 
CYP3A4 enzyme in this process. Thus, the proposed SmPC text which restricts the concomitant use of 
strong and moderate CYP3A4 inducers with  finerenone is supported.

Population pharmacokinetic analysis 
Population pharmacokientic (popPK) analyses were used throughout  the clinical drug development in a 
sequential manner. The popPK analysis of phase2b data (ARTS-DN and ARTS-DN Japan studies) was 
used to provide exposure predictions for an exposure-response analysis, and to evaluate potential PK 
differences between Japanese and non-Japanese patients. The final popPK analysis was based on data 
from the  FIDELIO-DKD study.  
Phase 2b analysis 
The final combined PK dataset, based on studies ARTS-DN and ARTS-DN Japan, contained 705 and 82 
subjects, and 4109 and 488 PK observations, respectively. The distribution  of race in the global 
population from study 16243 was: 84.6%  Caucasian, 10.1%  Asian, 3.3%  Black/African American and 
2.0% other/not  reported.  
A two-compartment model with first-order absorption (and 3 transit  compartments) and elimination 
adequately described the PK of finerenone over the 1.25 to  20 mg dose range in  both populations. 
Covariate effects eGFR-MDRD on CL/F and F,  and body weight on V/F  were included in the model. Low 
to moderate shrinkage values for empirical Bayes estimates indicate that the  exposure predictions 
were adequate for exposure-response analysis. 
Following  differences between the Japanese and the global population were observed. BW was 20% 
lower in the Japanese population, resulting in  a 10%  lower Vc/F. eGFR-MDRD was 3.5% lower in the 
Japanese population, resulting in  a 0.4%  difference (not significant)  of AUCτ,md between both 
populations. Neither dose normalised Cmax,md (Cmax,md/D), nor dose normalised AUCτ,md (AUCτ,md/D), nor 
the model parameters CL/F, F,  Vc/F or the  absorption rate (Ka) were significantly different between 
both populations. 
Phase 3 analysis 
Assessment report  
EMA/78746/2022

The final PK dataset contained 5057  valid finerenone concentrations from 2284  subjects (FIDELIO-DKD 
study). The number of subjects receiving a starting dose of 10  mg or 20 mg dose was 2112  (92.5%) 
and 172 (7.53%),  respectively.  
The PK of finerenone in the phase 3 population was best described by a linear two-compartment model 
in which  Vc/F was assumed to be equal to Vp/F,  with first-order elimination from the  central 
compartment. The delay in absorption was described as first order absorption via three transit 
compartments with a lag time. Inter-individual variability of CL/F  and V/F was estimated at 32.1% and 
33.5%,  respectively. Shrinkage in empirical Bayes estimates for CL/F and V/F was 26.4%  and 47.4%, 
respectively. 
In the covariate analysis, in addition  to BW, race/ethnicity (Korean subjects only) was found to have a 
statistically significant  influence on V/F,  while in addition to time  varying eGFR, body heights, 
creatinine, smoking status,  CYP3A4 inhibitor  and SGLT2i use showed a statistically  significant effect 
when applied on both CL/F  and F.  Furthermore, gamma glutamyl transferase (GGT) was found to have 
a statistically significant influence on CL/F. 
Steady-state Cmax,md and AUCτ,md values from FIDELIO-DKD study were 163  µg/L and 668  µg*h/L, 
respectively. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Three studies in healthy individuals were conducted to  characterise the pharmacodynamics of 
finerenone. In addition, a thorough QT-study was conducted. Finerenone is a mineralocorticoid 
receptor (MR)  antagonist. The desirable properties for the  intended population of patients with  T2D 
and CKD are cardiorenal protection and not the  potassium-sparing diuretic effect. The following 
pharmacodynamic studies investigated single- and multiple dose response of finerenone, as well as the 
response after fludrocortisone challenge. 
Mechanism  of action 
Finerenone (BAY 94-8862)  is a novel, non-steroidal and selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) 
antagonist. The steroidal hormones, aldosterone and cortisol, are natural ligands of the MR, which is 
expressed extensively in the heart, kidneys and blood vessels. Overactivation of the MR  contributes to 
organ damage found in CKD, HF  and hypertension, through  mediation of pro-inflammatory and pro-
fibrotic effects, as well as via sodium retention and endothelial dysfunction.  
Finerenone combines high in vitro potency (IC50 of 17.8  nM)  and selectivity (at least 500-fold 
compared to other steroid hormone receptors) toward the MR.  Finerenone blocks the  relevant MR 
agonists aldosterone and cortisol more potently than the  steroidal MRAs spironolactone and 
eplerenone. Importantly, finerenone does not exhibit any activity up to 10 μM  at the androgen 
receptor.  
The non-steroidal structure of finerenone, its  ‘bulky’ binding  mode to the  MR and its differential effects 
on downstream myocardial hypertrophy gene expression compared to eplerenone, suggest a different 
pharmacological profile 31, 32. Furthermore, unlike spironolactone and eplerenone, which reach higher

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Study 13782:  Single dose escalation study 
This First-in-Man  study was a single-centre, randomised, single-blinded, parallel-group, placebo-
controlled study conducted in healthy male subjects. It investigated safety and tolerability after 
increasing single oral doses of 1, 2.5, 5, 10,  20 and 40 mg finerenone or placebo administered as PEG 
solution. 
Forty-five (45) healthy male subjects received a single dose of study drug, 34 subjects received 
finerenone and 11 subjects received placebo. Dose groups consisted of 5 subjects each in the groups 
exposed to 1 and 2.5 mg finerenone, and 6 subjects each in  the groups exposed to 5, 10,  20, and 40 
mg finerenone. The subjects had a mean age of 33.6 years (range: 20  to 45 years) and a mean body 
mass index (BMI) of 24.2 kg/m² (range: 20.1 to 29.6  kg/m²). 
Pharmacodynamic results 
Single doses of 1 to 40 mg of finerenone did not influence BP, HR, or RAAS components in plasma. 
With  regard to urine electrolytes, no general effect of finerenone on urinary excretion of electrolytes 
was found. 
Study 13785:  Multiple dose escalation study 
This was a single centre, randomised, single-blind, placebo-controlled, group-comparison study. In Part 
A, the study investigated safety and tolerability of finerenone after multiple  oral doses of 10 mg twice 
daily (BID), 20 mg BID and 40 mg OD given as 10 mg tablets over a period of 10 days (subjects in the 
10 and 20 mg BID arms only received one dose of finerenone on the  last study day to allow for PK 
assessments of the terminal elimination phase) in  healthy male white subjects, 18 to  45 years of age, 
BMI ≥ 18.0  and ≤  29.9 kg/m². 
Pharmacodynamic results 
After 10 days of repeated treatment with  finerenone, the RAAS hormone levels (renin and aldosterone) 
were increased compared to placebo, without  a clear dose dependency of the effect: a pronounced 
increase was seen for plasma-renin-activity for the  10 mg BID and 20 mg BID treatments and for 
serum aldosterone at  the 20 mg BID and the 40 mg OD dose levels compared to placebo (Table 8). 
The observed effects on hormone levels reversed within 48 h after last study drug intake.

There was no consistent evidence of clinically relevant increase of natriuresis or reduction of urine 
potassium after multiple  oral administration  of 10  mg and 20  mg bid  or 40 mg od of finerenone tablets 
in this  study. 
Study 13786:  Mechanistic proof of concept study after fludrocortisone challenge 
This was a single-centre, randomised, single-blinded, placebo-controlled, active-controlled, combined 
3-fold crossover and parallel-group study to investigate the effectiveness (PD) of different single doses 
of finerenone with  regards to natriuresis after administration of 0.5 mg fludrocortisone in  white healthy 
male subjects. Eplerenone (50  mg) was used as an active control. 
This study investigated the natriuretic effects of finerenone in  comparison to the MRA eplerenone after 
administration of a single oral dose of 0.5 mg fludrocortisone as MR activator 2 h prior to the 
administration. Urine was collected in aliquots up to 26 hours after administration of finerenone. 
For each subject the study  consisted of 3 periods, each including a 3-day in-house adaptation phase 
(start of defined food and beverage intake), 1 profile day, an in-house observation until  60 h after 
administration of study drug, and a wash-out period of approximately 1 week after administration of 
the test  substance 
Each subject received the following treatment  sequence (crossover): 
• 
• 
• 
Treatment A: finerenone (2.5, 5, 10,  20 mg in PEG or 2x10 mg tablets) 
Treatment B: corresponding placebo of finerenone dose. 
Treatment C: 50 mg eplerenone 
The wash-out phase between each treatment period consisted of at least 1 week. 
Results 
Finerenone showed dose-dependent natriuretic effects starting  from the dose of 2.5  mg PEG solution. 
In the 2 to 10  h urine collection interval after treatment, finerenone 20 mg PEG solution increased 
urinary Na+ excretion significantly more than 50  mg eplerenone. In contrast, 50  mg eplerenone led to 
a significantly higher Na+ excretion compared to finerenone at doses of 2.5  and 5  mg PEG solution

during most time intervals, whereas no relevant differences were observed between 50  mg eplerenone 
and finerenone 10 mg PEG solution and 20 mg (2 × 10  mg) tablets.  
Both finerenone and 50 mg eplerenone significantly decreased urinary K+ excretion as compared to 
placebo. K+ excretion in urine was higher with  eplerenone than with  any dose of finerenone; however, 
these differences reached statistical significance in  only few instances.  
In the placebo group 0.5 mg fludrocortisone decreased urinary Na+/K+-ratio as expected. In the 2 to 
10 h urine collection interval after treatment,  both finerenone and 50 mg eplerenone as MRAs blocked 
the fludrocortisone effect and significantly increased the specific parameter log10 (10*Na+/K+ ratio) 
compared to placebo (Table 9). This increase was significantly higher after administration of 20 mg 
finerenone (given either as PEG solution or tablets) than with  50 mg eplerenone in the 2 to  10 h 
interval after dosing and similar between eplerenone and 10 mg PEG solution. In contrast, the 
parameter was significantly higher after administration of 50 mg eplerenone compared to finerenone at 
doses of 2.5 and 5 mg PEG solution during most time intervals.

Secondary pharmacology 
MR is expressed extensively in the heart, kidneys and blood vessels, thus the pharmacological effects 
are mainly expected to be related to these organs. The PD parameters measured to assess potential 
MR antagonism-related effects in the  early studies previously discussed in the report were BP and 
heart rate as standard parameters. In all studies, no clinically relevant influence was found up to the 
highest single dose of 80 mg and the highest  multiple dose treatment  of 40  mg for 10 days. 
Apart from a thorough QT study, no specific studies have been performed on the secondary 
pharmacology.

therapeutic dose and 80 mg, to  establish safety range for supratherapeutic dose) of finerenone on the 
QTc interval in 60  white healthy male and female subjects. Additionally, other PD parameters (HR, BP), 
PK of finerenone and its  metabolites, safety and tolerability were assessed.  
The primary analysis showed that for all time points, the upper limits of the one-sided 95% CIs of the 
mean differences to placebo of QTcF values remained below the  threshold of Δ=10  msec, i.e. there 
was no relevant treatment effect after administration  of 20  mg or 80 mg finerenone on QTcF.  
For the secondary variables QTcB, QTcI (corrected using individual correction formula) and QT, the 
upper limits of the one-sided 95%  CIs of the mean differences to placebo remained completely below 
the threshold of Δ=10 msec, i.e. no relevant prolongation was seen at any time after administration of 
20 mg finerenone and 80 mg finerenone.  
From 1 h to 6 h  following administration of moxifloxacin, the LS-mean differences moxifloxacin – 
placebo in QTcF ranged from 8.53  msec to a peak of 11.87 msec (one-sided 95%  CI: [9.95  msec, inf]) 
found at 4 h after drug administration. 
Minimum  and maximum LS-means differences as well as corresponding 95%  CIs are summarised in

Exposure – response relationship for UACR, eGFR, and serum potassium in ARTS-DN 
ER relationships were investigated based on ARTS-DN data and ARTS-DN Japan employing indirect 
response models for UACR, eGFR, and serum potassium. The ARTS-DN studies included a range of 
fixed finerenone doses (0-20 mg). 
The concentration–effect relationship over time for the efficacy marker UACR was characterised by a 
maximum effect model indicating  saturation of effect at  high exposures. For the safety markers, a log-
linear model and a power model were identified for serum potassium concentration and eGFR, 
respectively. The model-predicted times to reach the full (99%)  steady-state drug effect on UACR, 
serum potassium, and eGFR were 138,  20, and 85 days, respectively. The PK half-life was 2–3 h and 
PK steady-state was achieved after 2  days, indicating timescale separation. A visualisation of the ER 
relationships is presented in Figure 6. Neither  the concentration-effect relationship for the efficacy 
marker nor that  for the safety markers is considered steep. There was no apparent ethnic effect on the 
investigated PK/PD relationships when comparing data from ARTS-DN and ARTS-DN Japan.

ARTS-DN demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in UACR with  finerenone as an adjunct to RAS 
inhibitor  therapy over 90 days of treatment.  Statistically significant reductions compared to placebo of 
21%, 25%,  33% and 38% were observed with the 4 highest  doses investigated: 7.5 mg, 10  mg, 15 
mg, and 20 mg OD, respectively. UACR did not return back to  baseline after treatment  discontinuation. 
Subgroup analyses by eGFR at baseline revealed no relevant differences. There was a small reduction 
in mean eGFR from baseline to Visit 5  (Day 90±2), especially at the  finerenone 10 mg OD to  20 mg OD 
dose range. Mean eGFR then  showed a tendency to return towards baseline values at the  follow-up 
visit (30±5  days after the last intake of study drug) in  these finerenone dose groups. 
Exposure – response in FIDELIO-DKD 
Exposure – time-to-event analyses for the primary renal and key secondary cardiovascular composite 
endpoints of FIDELIO-DKD were performed. Using parametric time-to-event  models with  Emax models 
for the exposure-driven drug effect, these analyses indicate that  patients with  higher finerenone show 
a slightly stronger reduction of the risk for a primary and secondary endpoint event than patients with 
lower finerenone exposure. The E-R relationships based on the FIDELIO-DKD data indicate that  several

patient factors influence the renal and cardiovascular hazard independently of finerenone treatment. 
Among them are known risk factors like high UACR and low eGFR, but also co-medications such as 
SGLT2is that decrease the hazard for the primary endpoint by 28.2% (95%CI:  11.8-44.5%). 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Finerenone clinical development programme consisted of 34 clinical studies in total.  The applicant  has 
conducted 28 Phase I clinical studies to obtain necessary clinical pharmacology data for finerenone. In 
addition to  clinical data, in  vitro and in silico analyses were done to address relevant Clinical 
Pharmacology aspects. Overall, the Pharmacokinetic (PK) properties are well described by the applicant 
and sufficient data are generated to  describe its disposition, PK in special patient  populations, drug-
drug interaction (DDI) potential.   
In the phase 3  study (FIDELIO-DKD) the dose was titrated  based on serum potassium levels and eGFR 
was employed. The predicted exposure range in FIDELIO-DKD at steady-state was Cmax 57-238  µg/L 
(5th and 95th quantiles for 10  mg and 20  mg, respectively) and AUC 229-1123  µg.h/L  (5th and 95th 
quantiles for 10 mg and 20 mg, respectively), which is considered the therapeutic exposure range 
where efficacy and safety have been studied.  No  exposure data is available in patients with  severe 
hepatic impairment or in  patients with  concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors.  However, it  is anticipated 
that  the exposure in these patients  will exceed the therapeutic exposure range and as such the 
applicant’s proposal to avoid treatment in severe HI patients and in patients with  concomitant use of 
strong CYP3A4 inhibitors is supported. 
Pharmacokinetic properties 
PK properties of finerenone were adequately and well-investigated within  several phase I studies and 
many popPK models have been developed to further investigate PK profile of the drug in phase I, II 
and III studies. In addition, a PBPK models has been developed. 
During clinical development, two IR tablet formulations have been used, namely the “Phase I-IIa” 
tablets and the “Phase IIb-III” tablets. Such clinical formulations present only minimal quantitative 
differences within  the tablet’s core composition, while minor differences can be found in the  film-
coating, which excipients are not  expected to influence the  dissolution rate. Both core composition and 
total amount  of pigment  in the film-coat are identical between the clinical “Phase IIb/III” tablet 
formulation and the proposed commercial product, whereas minimal differences exist both  in the ratio 
of pigments in the film-coat and one pigment itself. 
Interactions 
Several issues were noted within  the in  vitro DDI experiments which  needed to be further addressed in 
order to be able to  exclude risk for a clinically relevant DDIs. 
In the in vitro CYP induction  experiment (PH-39130)  no stability  data were found for finerenone during 
the incubations with  hepatocytes (i.e., only nominal finerenone concentrations were provided). 
Stability data were provided upon request and were sufficient to  make conclusions about the  CYP 
induction  effects. 
In vitro experiment (R-9574) investigated finerenone as a potential substrate of OATP1B1 and 
OATP1B3 transporters at two concentrations of 0.5 and 5 µM  (i.e. all concentrations were above the 
clinical concentration range) and was therefore considered inadequate and inconclusive as too high 
concentration of the investigational drug might saturate transporters in  question. Therefore, new 
substrate experiments with  the hepatic OATP1B1 and OTP1B3 transporters were performed including 
Assessment report  
EMA/78746/2022  
Page 74/159 
 
 
 
lower finerenone concentrations, which were in line with  the Appendix III of the  EMA DDI guideline. 
New experimental data have confirmed that finerenone is not  a substrate of OATP transporters. 
Of further note, new clinical DDI study denoted as Study 21429  was completed and presented after the 
initial  marketing authorisation application was submitted.  This clinical study which included 
rosuvastatin as the “victim  drug” (OATPs and BCRP substrate) has provided additional DDI data which 
excluded an interaction risk with  finerenone as a potential inhibitor  of OATPs and BCRP transporters. 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses 
PopPK analyses were used to throughout  the clinical drug development to propagate PK knowledge 
across the development stages, which is an approach that  is highly supported. The popPK analyses 
considered relevant for this submission are the analyses of phase 2b and phase 3 data.  
The phase 2b analysis (ARTS-DN global and Japan studies) contained a range of finerenone fixed doses 
(1.25  mg – 20 mg), and as such the  exposure range could provide valuable information in  the 
subsequent E-R analysis. The final model could describe the PK sufficiently well and the shrinkage 
values (<30%)  indicate that  the predicted exposure were adequate for the  E-R analysis. The only 
formally tested covariate was ethnicity (Japanese/non-Japanese), and no statistically significant 
difference was detected in  clearance or volume of distribution  which can be translated to no difference 
in AUC or Cmax, respectively. 
A popPK analysis was also performed on the (sparse) PK data collected in  the confirmatory FIDELIO-
DKD study, with  the main objectives to evaluate covariate factors for PK and derive exposure 
predictions to be used in exposure-response analyses. The model diagnostics and evaluations indicate 
that  the model can describe the data reasonably well (some under-prediction is noted), and as such 
the exposure predictions could be used in the exposure-response analyses. There is some uncertainty 
in the accuracy of the dosing history in the popPK dataset since individual administrations only seem to 
be available at visit 3, 5, 8, 11  and 14,  and the fact that  treatment interruptions and dose titration 
were allowed throughout  the study. 
Correlated covariates have been tested in  the development and further included in the final model, i.e. 
eGFR, height and creatinine on V/F. When correlated covariates are included in the model, the 
magnitude covariate effects are not independent and the effect of a single covariate (e.g. height) 
should be interpreted with  caution. This was considered in simulations considering multivariate 
covariate distributions.  In addition,  Korean ethnicity was identified as a significant  covariate although 
only 54 Korean subjects (2.4%) were included in the analysis so it is highly questionable whether 
reliable information regarding ethnicity  can be derived from such a small sample. In future analyses, 
the applicant is strongly recommended to make pre-specified decisions to include only one of several 
correlated covariates as well as a restriction on the  minimum number of subjects (or proportion of 
data) for a covariate to be tested to avoid selection-bias and correlated covariate effects. Nonetheless, 
the effect of body weight on V/F  and eGFR on CL/F  were similar across analyses (phase 1-3) which 
gives some reassurance that these effects are reliable. Nevertheless, due to the  titration-based dosing 
based on potassium levels and kidney function,  the covariate effects are considered of less importance 
and thus the  covariate model deficiencies are not further pursued. 
In conclusion, the population PK analysis of FIDELIO-DKD data is considered to have low impact of the 
finerenone label, hence improvements of the analysis are not perceived to influence the  dosing 
recommendation of finerenone.  
Pharmacodynamics 
Finerenone is a novel, non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist. Several pathological 
conditions, including  hyperglycaemia, are associated with MR receptor over-activation which  promotes 
Assessment report  
EMA/78746/2022  
Page 75/159 
 
 
 
cardiovascular and renal inflammatory and fibrotic processes. The previously approved MR-antagonists 
(MRA) spironolactone and eplerenone are associated with  hyperkalaemia. In addition, spironolactone 
has anti-androgenic effects. 
According to the  applicant, finerenone has properties that may provide renal protection with  a lower 
risk for hyperkalaemia compared to spironolactone and eplerenone. The applicant claims that  unlike 
eplerenone and spironolactone, a differential modulation can be exerted by finerenone across the 
spectrum of MR  activities depending upon its  tissue distribution,  as well as potency and selectivity 
toward MR, all of them determined by its  molecular structure. Specifically, the non-steroidal nature of 
the compound is believed to make treatment with  finerenone more advantageous than  therapy with 
the mentioned steroidal MRA by promoting a higher degree of protection against pro-fibrotic 
mechanisms while reducing the risk of the  hyperkaliaemic effect. The applicant’s argument is not 
sustained by experimental data, since preclinical mass balance studies did not  characterise the organ 
distribution  of finerenone relative to commercially available MR antagonists, and human ADME 
investigations only provided information on excretory pathways. Moreover, clinical PD investigations in 
Phase 2 trials comparing finerenone with  either spironolactone or eplerenone revealed similarity in 
terms of both  efficacy and safety parameters. Therefore, the advantage of finerenone over 
spironolactone or eplerenone is not  considered proven. 
The first-in-man single dose escalation study (Study 13782) investigated oral doses of 1, 2.5, 5,  10, 20 
and 40 mg finerenone. No effects on blood pressure, heart rate and the RAAS system or related 
electrolyte changes was observed, which may be expected given the short exposure time of 
finerenone. The effects of aldosterone are those on renal electrolyte handling where the hormone acts 
to secrete potassium while increasing sodium reabsorption. The effect on sodium reabsorption acts to 
increase blood pressure via an increased extracellular volume. This is a relatively slow process that  is 
involved in the long-term regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte homeostasis. Acute MR inhibition 
as in the present study with finerenone is therefore not  expected to have a great impact  on these 
parameters. In line with this,  no effects on the RAAS system or related electrolyte changes were 
observed. This study is therefore mainly important from a safety perspective, where it  showed that the 
finerenone was safe and tolerable in the  dose range tested.  The absence of PD effects also indicates 
that  finerenone does not have any acute secondary pharmacological effects on the cardiovascular 
system. 
The multiple dose escalation study (Study 13785)  investigated doses of 10-20 mg twice daily and 40 
mg film-coated tablet once daily for 10 days increased plasma renin and aldosterone hormone levels 
which are expected findings during MR-antagonism. There was no clear dose dependency of the effect. 
No consistent effects on electrolyte excretion were observed. In this model in healthy volunteers, the 
effects on electrolytes are complex due to  the concomitant increase in plasma renin. The study showed 
that  finerenone is safe and tolerable after repeated administration. Furthermore, the observed changes 
are in line with  the mode of action of finerenone as a MR antagonist.  
Study 13786  was a mechanistic proof of concept study. A dose of fludrocortisone was administered in 
order to increase basal sodium reabsorption whereupon different doses of finerenone or eplerenone 50 
mg was administered. Both agents caused an increased Na+/K+ ratio and reduced urine potassium 
concentration. Although these effects are undesirable in the context of treatment of CKD, the  findings 
provide clinical evidence for the mode of action of finerenone as an MR-antagonist.  The desirable 
effects of finerenone, i.e. protection of the kidneys and the CV system cannot be assessed in this short 
timeframe. The study provides clinical evidence for the mode of action of finerenone. Furthermore, the 
study indicates that  finerenone has potential  to cause hyperkalaemia.

Any QT-prolongating effect of finerenone is unlikely based on absence of prolonged interval in 
preclinical studies and the thorough  QT-study.  
Exposure-response 
The ER relationships based on the phase 2b studies are considered most useful for this submission. 
The ARTS-DN studies included a wide range of fixed (no titration)  doses which  enable an adequate 
analysis of the E-R relationships.  
A range of fixed doses (0  – 20 mg QD) were included in the ARTS-DN studies, thus  the data are 
considered adequate for assessing E-R relationships. No covariates were detected on the 
concentration-response relationships, although a difference in inter-individual variability between 
Japanese and non-Japanese patients was identified for all endpoints. A decrease in UACR with 
increasing plasma exposure was identified. Descriptive results indicate an effect of finerenone on UACR 
independently on renal filtration  in a short-term evaluation setting.  No meaningful clinical differences 
can be observed to explain the  inter-ethnic differences in response. However, an increased use of 
beta-blockers (46.7% vs 7.3%)  and diuretics (66.9%  vs 20.8%).  Among anti-hypertensive 
medications, their marked effect on aldosterone level is well described; in  line with this,  a higher level 
of aldosterone at baseline is observable in the ARTS-DN study versus the Japanese study (mean 
values: 55.45±45.51  vs 20.48±18.5,  with  median values: 44.35  pg/ml vs 13.18).  However, literature 
data from studies on eplerenone and spironolactone have not  shown a significant  correlation between 
baseline aldosterone levels and treatment  response. Whether the  same applies to  finerenone is 
uncertain. However, the  low sample sizes (12  subjects per treatment arm) limit further interpretation. 
Furthermore, E-R relationships were described for potassium and eGFR, where an increase in 
potassium levels with  increasing plasma concentrations, and a decrease in eGFR with  increasing 
plasma exposure were identified,  respectively. No covariates were detected for either relationship. 
In the ARTS-HF study, the MDRD formula was used for eGFR calculation.  Currently, the eGFR-EPI-
based calculation is preferred due to  high accuracy in estimating preserved renal function (eGFR≥60 
mL/min/1.73m2).  In the response to questions the applicant has provided reassurance on the 
correspondence between the concentration-effect relationships of the effect of finerenone with  eGFR as 
measured by either MDRD or EPI formula. 
Due to  the potassium and eGFR-based dose-titration in the FIDELIO-DKD study, the E-R relationships 
may be influenced by the  titration-scheme of the  study, thus it  should be interpreted with  caution. 
Also, and it  should be noted  that the E-R relationships are only valid within  this study design, dose 
range, and corresponding titration  scheme. In conclusion, the E-R analyses based on FIDELIO-DKD 
data are not considered meaningful. 
Overall, the identified E-R relationships for eGFR and serum potassium, based on ARTS-DN studies, are 
shallow over the therapeutic exposure range indicating  that a change in  exposure lead to a small 
change in eGFR and serum potassium. The justification  for the dosing regimen is further discussed in 
the Clinical efficacy section.   
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetic aspects of finerenone are generally well described. The applicant has presented 
clinical data on electrolyte handling and RAAS hormones that  support the intended mode of action of 
finerenone as a MR-antagonist.  Data on electrolyte handling indicate that  finerenone has potential to 
cause hyperkalaemia. A QT-prolongating effect of finerenone is unlikely based on the thorough QT-
study. There is a shallow exposure-response relationship for finerenone in the different tested clinical

2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
This application is based on efficacy data obtained from the following studies: 
• 
• 
• 
Two Phase II dose finding studies: ARTS-DN & ARTS-DN Japan (Study 16243 &  16816), 
The pivotal Phase III study: FIDELIO-DKD (Study 16244) 
Supportive data from the ARTS-HF (Study 14564),  ARTS-HF Japan (Study 16815)  and 
ARTS (Study 14563)  conducted in patients with  chronic heart failure 
An overview of the clinical development programme is given in Table 3, above. 
2.6.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The clinical development programme comprised two phase II dose-finding studies in the target 
population for the sought indication. 
ARTS-DN (Study  16243) 
Design 
The ARTS-DN study was a Phase 2b, randomised, adaptive, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-
group, multi-centre study with  a planned treatment  duration of 90 days. 
Methods 
Participants were male and female subjects (≥18  years of age) with  type 2 diabetes mellitus and a 
clinical diagnosis of DN treated with  an ACEI and/ or ARB for at least 3 months;  subjects with  an eGFR 
of 30-45 mL/min/1.73m2  according to the  Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-
EPI) equation must also be treated with  a non-potassium  sparing diuretic at screening. Serum 
potassium should be ≤4.8  mmol/L at screening. The clinical diagnosis of DN must be based on at least 
one of the  following criteria: 
• 
• 
Persistent very high albuminuria defined as UACR of ≥300  mg/g (≥34 mg/mmol) in 2 out  of 3 
first morning void samples and estimated glomerular filtration  rate (eGFR) ≥30 mL/min/1.73 
m2 but  < 90mL/min/1.73  m2 (CKD-EPI) or 
Persistent high albuminuria defined as UACR of ≥30  mg/g but <300  mg/g (≥3.4  mg/mmol but 
<34 mg/mmol) in  2 out of 3 first morning void samples and eGFR ≥30 mL/min/1.73  m2 but  < 
90mL/min/1.73  m2 (CKD-EPI) 
The primary objective of this study was to investigate the change in UACR from baseline to day 90 
after treatment with  different oral doses of finerenone given once daily. 
Following  an open-label run-in and screening period of up to  12 weeks, eligible subjects were 
randomised to one of 7 doses of finerenone or placebo on top  of standard of care to receive a 90-day 
study drug treatment. Initially, the  following 5 doses of finerenone and placebo were administered in a 
double-blind manner: 1.25 mg, 2.5 mg, 5mg,  7.5 mg, and 10 mg OD. After the safety and tolerability 
of these doses had been assessed by an independent DMC, 2 further doses of finerenone - 15 mg and 
20 mg OD - were introduced (Figure 7).

Results 
In total 1501  subjects were randomised at 128study  centres in 23 countries worldwide. Of the 823 
subjects randomised, 2 (0.2%)  subjects did not  receive any study drug; the remaining 821  randomised 
and treated subjects made up the safety analysis set (SAF). Of the 821  subjects in the SAF, 812 
subjects (98.7%)  had at least one post-baseline UACR value and were thus  valid for the FAS. Of the 
812 subjects in the FAS, 687  subjects (83.5%)  had no major protocol deviations and were thus  valid 
for the PPS. 
764 (92.8%)  of the 821  subjects in the  SAF completed the treatment phase. The remaining 59 
subjects discontinued study drug, 35 of these due to  AEs. 
Baseline  characteristics 
In the SAF and FAS, the treatment groups were comparable with respect to demographic 
characteristics. In the SAF, male subjects accounted for 71 to 85% of each treatment group; most 
subjects were white  (from 82 to  88%) and median age ranged from 63 to 66 years across treatment 
groups. Over half of the subjects (58%)  in the SAF had a BMI of >30  kg/m2; 61% of subjects were 
former or current cigarette smokers, and most subjects (>85%  in each treatment group) reported 
abstinence from alcohol or light  alcohol use.  
Baseline UACR and numbers of subjects with  high (<300  mg/g) and very high (≥300  mg/g) 
albuminuria at screening were consistent across the treatment groups; 503 subjects (61.3%)  had high 
albuminuria and 318 subjects (38.7%)  had very high albuminuria at screening. Overall, medical history 
findings were similar across treatment groups. In accordance with inclusion criteria, the study 
population was subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and clinical diagnosis of DN based on high  or 
very high albuminuria; in addition,  774 subjects (94.3%) had hypertension. Other medical history 
findings reported in  ≥20% of subjects in the SAF were obesity, dyslipidaemia, hyperlipidaemia, 
hypercholesterolaemia, diabetic retinopathy, and diabetic neuropathy. Reports of prior use (i.e. that 
started and ended before administration  of study drug) of medications of interest  (i.e. ACEIs, ARBs, 
beta-blockers, diuretics, potassium supplements, alpha blocking agents, calcium channel blockers, 
centrally-acting antihypertensives and strong, moderate, and weak CYP3A4 inhibitors, CYP3A4 
inducers, and CYP2C8 inhibitors)  were balanced across treatment groups. The most frequently 
Assessment report

Page 79/159 
 
 
 
 
reported prior medication of interest was diuretics, taken by 42  subjects (5.1%).  Diuretics were also 
the most commonly reported concomitant medication of interest  (reported by 68.8%  of subjects), 
followed by calcium channel blockers, ARBs, beta-blockers, ACEIs, CYP3A4 inducers, and weak CYP3A4 
inhibitors. Use of concomitant and new (i.e. started after start of study drug) concomitant medications 
of interest was generally balanced across treatment groups. 
Efficacy 
The primary efficacy variable demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in the ratio of UACR at Day 90 
to UACR at baseline with  finerenone compared to placebo. An ANCOVA demonstrated statistically 
significant reductions in UACR compared with placebo with  the 4 highest finerenone treatment groups 
(i.e. 7.5 mg, 10  mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg OD groups), with  larger effects seen with  increasing dose in 
those 4 treatment groups (Table 12).  The placebo-corrected reduction in UACR was 21%,  25%, 33%, 
and 38% in the  finerenone groups respectively. The treatment effect in  these higher dose groups 
appeared to increase over time, with  an effect already being observed at Visit  3 (Day 30±2) and Visit 4 
(Day 60±2),  but with  the greatest treatment effect (i.e. the smallest ratio to baseline) being observed 
at Visit 5 (Day 90±2) (except for the finerenone 10 mg OD group, for which the greatest change was 
observed at Visit 4 [Day 60±2]).   The geometric mean UACR levels had not returned to baseline values 
for these dose groups 30  days after completion of treatment, with  an approximately 16% reduction in 
UACR relative to baseline observed at Day 120 in  the finerenone 20 mg OD arm compared to placebo. 
A slightly lower treatment effect was seen in  the very high albuminuria group (UACR ≥300  mg/g) than 
in the high  albuminuria group (UACR ≥30 mg/g but  <300mg/g)(Table 13).  A summary of LS-mean 
change from baseline in serum potassium is given in Table 11. Compared to placebo, serum potassium 
was significantly increased in all dose group 90 days after start of treatment without  a clear dose-
dependency.  
Potassium ≥5.6 mmol/L that  was confirmed on re-test within  48 h leading to subsequent 
discontinuation  of study drug was defined as AE of special interest in this  study. 12 subjects (1.5%) 
reported such an AE, all in the finerenone group without  a clear dose-dependency.

ARTS-DN Japan  (Study  16816) 
Design 
The ARTS-DN Japan study was a Phase 2b,  randomised, adaptive, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
parallel-group, multi-centre  study with a planned treatment duration of 90 days with  a similar design 
as ARTS-DN but in  a Japanese population. 
Methods 
Participants were male and female subjects (≥18  years of age) with  type 2 diabetes mellitus and a 
clinical diagnosis of DN. This study used the same inclusion  criteria as described above for the ARTS-
DN study. 
The primary objective was to investigate the change of urinary albumin-to-creatinine  ratio (UACR) 
after treatment with  different oral doses of finerenone given once daily from baseline to Day 90. 
Following  a run-in  and screening period of up to 12 weeks in total, eligible subjects were randomised 
to 1 of up to 7 doses of finerenone or placebo on top of standard of care to receive a 90-day study 
drug treatment. 
No stratification  for randomisation was considered. However, a ratio of approximately 50:50  for high 
and very high albuminuria was planned to be reached. 
Initially, the following 5  doses of finerenone were to be compared to placebo in a double-blind manner: 
1.25  mg, 2.5mg, 5mg, 7.5 mg, and 10mg once daily.  After safety and tolerability of these doses had 
been assessed by an independent Data Monitoring  Committee, none or 1 higher dose arm of 
finerenone 15 mg once daily could be introduced (the first dose recommendation meeting). 
If the higher dose arm (15  mg finerenone once daily) was introduced, the second dose 
recommendation meeting was to assess safety and tolerability of all dose arms including  the newly 
introduced 15mg finerenone dose arm and decide if the highest  dose arm (20mg finerenone once 
daily) was allowed to be introduced to the study or not. 
Results 
A total of 120 subjects were enrolled and screened for their eligibilities for the study; 24 subjects failed 
screening and were not  randomised, and 96 subjects were assigned to  the study treatment.  All the 96 
subjects who were randomised took at least one study  medication and were valid for safety analysis.  
Of the 96 subjects in the SAF, 95 subjects (99.0%)  were valid for the  FAS and 90  subjects (93.8%) 
were valid for the  PPS. 
A total of 93 (96.9%)  of the 96 subjects in the SAF completed the treatment phase. The remaining 3 
randomised subjects discontinued study drug prematurely, 1 of these due to  AEs. 
Baseline characteristics 
The distribution  of demographic and baseline characteristics was generally similar across treatment 
groups.  Overall, 80.2% of subjects were men.  The mean age as a whole was 62.95  years with  a 
range of 41 to  83 years.  Most subjects (76 subjects [79.2%]) had a BMI of ≤30 kg/m2. 
Overall, 51 subjects (53.1%)  had high albuminuria and 45 subjects (46.9%)  had very high albuminuria 
at screening.  Their distribution  was imbalanced in some treatment  groups (2.5  mg, 7.5mg and 20mg 
once daily [OD] groups) because of the limited  number of subjects. 
Overall, medical history findings were similar across treatment groups. In accordance with inclusion 
criteria, the study population was subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus and albuminuria.  In addition, 
92 subjects (95.8%)  had hypertension. 
Assessment report  
EMA/78746/2022  
Page 82/159 
 
 
 
Reports of prior use of medications of interest were balanced across treatment groups. An ARB was the 
most commonly reported concomitant  medication of interest (reported by 90.6%  of subjects), followed 
by (in descending order of frequency) calcium channel blockers, weak CYP3A4 inhibitors,  and diuretics.  
Other baseline characteristics (i.e. levels of potassium, creatinine, eGFR, BNP, aldosterone, NT-proBNP, 
galectin-3, cystatin  C, troponin  T, and vital signs findings)  were similarly distributed  across the 
treatment groups and among the  populations analysed. 
Efficacy 
The primary efficacy analysis indicated a nominally significant effect of finerenone on the ratio of UACR 
at Visit 8 (Day 90±3) to UACR at baseline (primary efficacy endpoint) when adjusting for type of 
albuminuria at screening, and including  the log-transformed baseline UACR as a covariate nested 
within  type of albuminuria at screening (nominal p-value for the linear contrast =  0.0314).  Pairwise 
comparisons of each of the finerenone dose groups with  placebo resulted in nominally statistically 
significant differences from placebo for the highest  treatment group (i.e. 20mg OD). (Table 14)

2.6.5.2.  Main  study 
The application is based on a single pivotal phase III study, FIDELIO-DKD where 5658  patients were 
treated with  either finerenone or placebo. 
In addition to FIDELIO-DKD, the  clinical development programme also includes the FIGARO-DKD phase 
III study. Compared to FIDELIO-DKD, the  primary and main secondary endpoints of FIGARO-DKD have 
shifted places. Consequently, FIGARO-DKD has a primary CV endpoint  whereas the kidney endpoint is 
the main secondary. The study was recently completed and a high level summary has been submitted 
with  the D120 response. The applicant plans to submit the full  results as a future type II variation.

The design of FIDELIO-DKD (Figure 8)  included a run-in  period of 4 to 16 weeks duration  to optimize 
guideline-directed standard of care therapy with RAS inhibitors  prior to  screening and subsequent 
randomisation to 2 treatment arms, finerenone and placebo with  a dose-titration  regimen (Table 15). 
The study used a dosing scheme based on eGFR at screening and the consequent blood potassium 
concentration throughout  the study in order to reach maximum dose without  comprising safety. Details 
for adjustments in relation to blood potassium are given in Table 16.

death. 
Efficacy endpoints were evaluated by a Clinical Event Committee. Pre-defined disease-related outcome 
events that  were categorised as efficacy variables were kidney failure, renal death, chronic sustained 
decrease in eGFR, CV death, non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, heart failure 
hospitalisation, new onset of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter and other CV hospitalisation. 
Kidney failure was defined as either the  occurrence of ESRD or an eGFR of less than 15 mL/min/1.73 
m², confirmed by a second measurement at the earliest 4 weeks after the initial measurement. 
ESRD was defined as the initiation  of chronic dialysis (haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) for at least 
90 days or renal transplantation. In addition, the  eGFR threshold of 15 mL/min/1.73  m2 was consistent 
with  the definition of kidney failure from Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) 2013 
and was chosen to include an objective component to the endpoint  because the decision to  initiate 
dialysis therapy or kidney transplantation might  be affected by factors other than the eGFR.

A total of 1068 primary efficacy endpoint  events were to  imply a minimum 90%  power to demonstrate 
superiority of finerenone to placebo using a log rank test at a two-sided significance level of 3.3333% 
and assuming a 20%  relative risk reduction, i.e. a true hazard ratio of 0.80. For the  calculations, a 
12% annual event rate for the primary endpoint  in the placebo group was assumed based on data 
from previous clinical studies.  The two-sided significance level of 3.3333%  (i.e. 2/3 of 0.05) was in 
alignment with  the planned multiple testing  procedure. Due to  lower than  expected recruitment rate, 
study duration as well as the  number of sites were increased within  a protocol amendment. Further, 
due to lower event rates than had been expected, the  sample size was in addition  increased by 1000 
subjects: from initially  4800 to approximately 5800  randomised subjects. 
•  Randomisation and  Blinding (masking) 
In order to be eligible for randomisation, patients must have completed the run-in  period, the purpose 
of which was to ensure that  the subject’s SoC therapy including treatment with  ACEIs or ARBs was 
optimised and that all inclusion and exclusion criteria are met at the  subsequent screening visit. 
Eligible subjects were randomised 1:1  within  ≤2 weeks after the screening visit. Randomisation was 
stratified according to  the following: 
•  Region (North America, Europe, Asia, Latin  America and others) 
• 
• 
Type of albuminuria at screening (high  or very high albuminuria) 
eGFR at screening (25 to  <45, 45 to  <60, ≥60  mL/min/1.73  m²) 
The number of subjects with  eGFR ≥60  to <75 mL/min/1.73  m2 and very high albuminuria was capped 
at approximately 10% of the total  study population with  very high albuminuria at screening. 
The number of subjects with  high albuminuria and presence of diabetic retinopathy in the medical 
history was capped at approximately 10% of the total population  at screening.  
Finerenone immediate release tablets (10 mg and 20 mg) and placebo tablets  were identical in 
appearance (size, shape, colour). The packaging and labelling were designed to maintain the blinding 
of the investigator’s team and the subjects. The study data remained blinded until  database lock and 
authorisation of data release according to standard operating procedures. Furthermore, measures were 
taken to maintain blinding  of the  study team while  bioanalysis of PK and biomarker samples was 
ongoing. 
•  Statistical methods 
The approved SAP version 1.0 was dated 03 AUG 2016,  version 2.0 was dated 07 JUN  2019,  and 
version 3.0 was dated 12 SEP 2019. The final version of the SAP (version 4.0)  was dated 14  FEB 2020. 
In addition, there exists a supplemental SAP describing post-hoc efficacy and safety analyses. The 
changes from version 1 to version 2 concerned e.g. the sample size update and the exclusion of 
subjects from analysis sets due to critical GCP violations. In addition, the  significance level which  would 
remain for the final analysis after conducting the interim  analysis was specified. The changes made 
leading to version 3 and version 4 respectively concerned mostly clarifications, corrections, 
specifications, additions, and deletions whereof none should have had any major impact on the primary 
analysis of the primary or key secondary endpoints. 
Following  the original database release on 19  JUN 2020  and before finalisation of the CSR, the 
database was updated to include, by the applicant, notated as necessary corrections that affected 
certain analyses of the study.  With the re-release (29 JUL  2020) one missing non-fatal ischemic stroke 
event had been added, which  impacted the results for the key secondary CV composite endpoint. 
Adjudication information on a death case was added with impact  on the  results for the secondary 
endpoint all-cause mortality as well as other time-to-event endpoints where the  death date was used 
Assessment report  
EMA/78746/2022  
Page 88/159 
 
 
 
as the new censoring date. Further,  several missing hospitalisations were added. Of those 5 in the 
finerenone arm and 8 in  the placebo arm became the new first hospitalisation event, which impacted 
the results for the secondary endpoint all-cause hospitalisation. 
The primary analysis was performed on the FAS including  all randomised subjects but  for subjects with 
GCP issues. This concerned overall approximately 1% (60/5737)  of randomised subjects and a similar 
number of subjects in each arm. 
All the important endpoints  but for one, change in UACR at month 4, were time-to event endpoints. 
The primary efficacy variable was the time to  first occurrence of the composite endpoint of onset of 
kidney failure, a sustained decrease of eGFR ≥40%  from baseline over at  least 4 weeks, or renal 
death. The primary analysis was based on the endpoint events (i.e. first occurrences) from 
randomisation up until the  end-of-study visit that were positively adjudicated by an independent 
adjudication committee. 
For the comparison of finerenone versus placebo, a log rank test  stratified by the  stratification factors 
region, type of albuminuria and eGFR category was used. The hazard ratio (HR) and corresponding 
two-sided 95%  CI was estimated using a stratified Cox proportional hazard regression model. 
Censoring rules were pre-defined. The censoring mechanism of subjects without  an event of the 
primary composite endpoint at the time of analysis was assumed to be non-informative. 
Supportive and/or sensitivity analyses were planned and have been presented, among them a Tipping 
Point analysis for the primary and key secondary endpoint.  
The primary analysis of the secondary time-to-event endpoints were conducted analogously to the 
primary analysis of the primary composite endpoint, with  modifications to the censoring rules as the 
events differed. Consistent with  the methods for the  primary and secondary efficacy variables, 
components or composites of the  components of the primary and secondary time-to-event endpoints 
were analysed as exploratory time-to-event variables using a stratified log rank test  and a stratified 
Cox proportional hazard regression model. 
For the analysis of change in UACR month  4, an ANCOVA model was fitted  to logarithmised ratios of 
UACR at Month  4 to UACR at baseline including the  factors treatment group, the stratification  factors 
region, type of albuminuria and eGFR category and the logarithmised baseline UACR as covariate. 
Here, subjects without  a measurement within  the  pre-defined time window were excluded. In the end, 
a high and similar proportion of subjects in each treatment arm had data available and hence was 
included in the primary analysis (>95%  in both  the finerenone and the placebo arm).  
One formal interim analysis was planned when 2/3 of the required total  number of primary efficacy 
endpoint events had been observed. In case of clear and consistent  finerenone benefit, the DMC could 
recommend early study termination. Details of the interim analysis were covered in the DMC charter, 
the analysis was described in a separate DMC SAP and the statistical  analysis were performed by an 
independent statistical  analysis centre. 
On 25 SEP 2019, the  DMC communicated the decision to continue the  study as planned without 
changes to  the CSP. 
Since the  study could not be stopped early for success, the final primary analyses were pre-planned as 
follows: The weighted Bonferroni-Holm procedure was to be used for the hierarchical testing  of the 
primary and secondary efficacy endpoints with  the following adjusted alpha levels: 
• If the primary renal composite endpoint achieved statistical  significance at a two-sided p value 
≤0.03282695,  the secondary CV endpoint was to be tested at the two-sided  0.04967388  level. 
Assessment report  
EMA/78746/2022  
Page 89/159 
 
 
 
• Alternatively, if the  secondary CV endpoint achieved statistical significance at a two-sided p value 
≤0.01576184,  the primary renal composite endpoint was to be tested at the two-sided 0.04967388 
level. 
• Only if both the renal and CV endpoints achieved formal statistical  significance, were the remaining 
secondary endpoints to be tested at a two-sided level of 0.04967388  according to  the pre-defined 
hierarchy, as described below. 
If the testing strategy stopped at one point due to a non-significant result, the  testing of the remaining 
secondary efficacy variables was to be performed in an explorative manner only. 
Results 
•  Participant flow 
This study was conducted in 1024 sites across 48 countries and enrolled 13911  patients.  5734 subjects 
were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive oral finerenone or placebo. After randomisation and during 
study conduct, 60  subject identifiers were prospectively excluded from all analyses due to critical Good 
Clinical Practice violations, resulting in a FAS population of 5674 subjects. As 16 subjects did not take 
any study  drug, 5658 subjects were valid for the SAF (2827  subjects on finerenone, 2831 subjects on 
placebo). Figure  9 shows a flow chart over the study participants.

aNumber of subjects  enrolled is the number  of subjects  who signed informed consent, including subjects  who 
switched from study  17530  to study  16244. 
bA subject  is considered as having completed the study  if there was a contact with the subject  after the end-of-
study notification or if the subject  died. Contact with the subject  could be actual visits, phone contacts, or 
information available from public records,  etc. 
Treatment duration (from first  to last intake of study drug) was similar between the finerenone and 
placebo arms. Mean and median duration of treatment in the  FAS were 26.882  and 27.039  months in 
the finerenone arm and 27.162 and 27.203  months in the  placebo arm, respectively. 
A total of 86.3% of subjects in the finerenone arm and 87.0% of subjects in the placebo arm took the 
study medication for at least 12  months. Over half of the  subjects took the study medication for at 
least 24 months (57.6%  in finerenone, 58.5%  in placebo) and approximately a quarter of subjects 
took the study drug for at  least 36  months (25.6%  in finerenone, 25.3%  in placebo). 
•  Recruitment 
The total exposure of subjects to study drug was 12777  patient-years, with  6346  patient-years in the 
finerenone arm and 6431  patient-years in the  placebo arm. The mean average daily dose was 15.138 
mg (SD 4.472  mg) in the finerenone arm and 16.480  mg (SD 4.014  mg) in the placebo arm. 
•  Conduct of the study 
The first patient was enrolled on September 17,  2015 and the last patient  completed the  study on April 
14, 2020.

Kaplan-Meier curves for finerenone and placebo are similar up until  Month  12 and diverge thereafter 
(Figure 10),  indicating a treatment effect for finerenone over the  course of this  trial. The stepwise 
appearance of the finerenone and placebo curves indicate the  substantial contribution  of the eGFR 
component that was primarily determined at visits every 4th month.

Figure 11. Kaplan-Meier curves for time to first occurrence of the renal composite endpoint (FAS) 
In both treatment arms a comparably low number of events occurred during the first year after 
randomisation (Table 24).  The absolute risk reduction based on Kaplan-Meier cumulative incidences for 
the primary renal composite endpoint was 2.9%  at Month  24 and 3.4% at Month  36  with finerenone 
compared to placebo, corresponding to  NNTs to prevent one primary endpoint  event of 34 and 29 
subjects, respectively. Numbers of subjects at risk at Month  48 (83  in the finerenone arm, 82 in the 
placebo arm, see Figure 10) are too low for any meaningful interpretation.

Subgroup analyses  of the primary endpoint 
Randomisation and analyses were stratified by the factors region, type of albuminuria and eGFR 
category at screening. There were no statistical  interactions in the different stratification groups 
(Figure 11).  However, for region, there appears to be a more pronounced effect in Asia than the  other 
regions and the effect in Europe was more modest (HR=0.92).   
The following subgroups had treatment  interaction p-values <0.05:  history of CV disease, baseline BMI 
and baseline waist circumference (Figure 12).  Data suggests that  patient without  history of CVD has a 
less pronounced response than patients with  a history of CVD (HR 0.94 [0.80;  1.09)]  vs. HR  0.70 
[0.58;0.84]). 
Furthermore, patients with  a baseline BMI above 30 kg/m2 had a less pronounced response (HR 0.98 
[0.83;  1.17]) than  patients with  a BMI under 30  kg/m2 (HR 0.68  [0.58;  0.81]).

Secondary endpoints 
Key secondary CV composite endpoint 
Treatment with  finerenone reduced the risk of the key secondary CV composite endpoint when 
compared with  placebo with  a HR  of 0.860  (95% CI 0.747;  0.989,  log rank test p=0.0339).  The 
components of the  composite are presented in Table 25.  The Kaplan-Meier curves for finerenone and 
placebo diverge from Month  1 onwards with  a consistent course throughout  the study (Figure 13).  The 
treatment effect of finerenone is supported by the FAS on treatment sensitivity analysis (HR  0.781, 
[95% CI 0.664;0.918],  nominal p-value=0.0026).

Subgroup analyses of the key secondary endpoint 
Point estimates of the HRs in the various subgroups were generally consistent with  the overall result of 
the key secondary CV composite, with  the majority having HRs <1. No  treatment interaction p-values 
<0.05  were observed. 
All-cause mortality 
Finerenone treatment resulted in a 10.5%  RRR in  the time to all-cause mortality compared to  placebo. 
Although not  statistically significant (HR  of 0.895,  [95%  CI 0.746;  1.075],  p=0.2348),  this  result was 
directionally consistent  with  the primary and key secondary endpoints. Since the result for all-cause 
mortality did not reach statistical significance, the hierarchical testing  sequence was stopped per 
protocol and statistical  testing  was performed in an exploratory manner. The components of the 
composite are presented in

Kaplan-Meier curves for finerenone and placebo are provided in Figure  15. The absolute risk reduction 
was 0.6% at Month  24  and 1.0%  at Month  36. 
The result described above for the FAS was supported by the PPS analysis  (for which  only events 
occurring up  to 30 days after treatment discontinuation  were considered) which  showed a 29.5%  RRR 
in the time to  all-cause mortality (HR of 0.705,  [95% CI 0.535;  0.928], p=0.0122)  in subjects who 
were not  excluded due to pre-defined validity criteria related to non-compliance to study drug or 
protocol requirements and procedures. 
Subgroup analysis indicated interactions in the subgroups ‘History of CVD’ and ‘Age at run-in visit’.

All-cause hospitalisation 
For all-cause hospitalisation,  the comparison of finerenone with  placebo showed a HR of 0.946  (95% CI 
0.876;  1.022,  log rank test p=0.1623).  Statistical  testing was performed in an explorative manner 
given that the hierarchical testing  sequence was stopped in the previous step.

1263  subjects (44.6%)  in the finerenone arm and 1321 subjects (46.5%)  in the placebo arm were 
hospitalised for any cause. The incidence rates for all-cause hospitalisation were 22.56/100  patient-
years (finerenone) and 23.87/100  patient-years (placebo).

Change in  UACR from baseline to Month  4 
Treatment with  finerenone led to  a larger UACR reduction from baseline to Month  4 than placebo.  
The LS means ratio with  an ANCOVA was 0.688  (95%  CI 0.662;  0.715,  p<0.0001),  which corresponds 
to a placebo-corrected relative reduction in UACR from baseline to Month  4 of 31.2%.  Statistical 
testing  was performed in an explorative manner given that the  hierarchical testing sequence was 
stopped in the previous steps. 
Secondary renal composite (with  component decrease in eGFR ≥57%) 
Compared to the primary renal composite endpoint,  which consisted of the  component ‘sustained 
decrease in eGFR of ≥40%’,  the secondary renal composite endpoint  replaced this component with a 
‘sustained decrease in eGFR of ≥57%’ (equivalent to a doubling of serum creatinine). 
Finerenone treatment resulted in a 23.7%  RRR in  the first event of the adjudicated secondary renal 
composite of kidney failure, a sustained decrease of eGFR ≥57%  from baseline over at least 4 weeks, 
or renal death (HR of 0.763  [95% CI 0.648; 0.900],  p=0.0012).  Statistical testing  was performed in an 
explorative manner given that the  hierarchical testing sequence was stopped in the previous steps.  
For the secondary renal composite endpoint, Kaplan-Meier curves for finerenone and placebo started to 
diverge from around Month  12 onwards (Figure 17). The observed treatment effect supports the 
findings of the primary renal endpoint.

Explorative endpoints 
Change in  eGFR from baseline 
Prespecified evaluations of eGFR included analyses of values by visit  (below), and numbers of subjects 
with  relative eGFR decreases by category (e.g. ≥57%  decrease from baseline). 
In finerenone-treated subjects, an initial  (‘acute’) reduction in eGFR was observed compared to 
placebo, with  a difference in LS means (finerenone minus placebo) of  2.38  mL/min/1.73  m2 from 
baseline to Month  4;  thereafter, a more attenuated decline over time in the eGFR (‘chronic’) slope was 
observed in finerenone-treated subjects compared to those on placebo (Figure  18). 
An ANCOVA of the chronic eGFR slope (from Month  4 until  the PD or EOS visit) also describes a slower 
decline in eGFR over time with  finerenone: the  annualised difference in LS means (finerenone minus 
placebo) was 1.310  mL/min/1.73  m2 (p<0.0001).  Further analyses across both treatment  arms show 
that  in the FAS, the acute and chronic slopes are negatively correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient 
-0.227,  [95% CI  0.255;   0.198], p <0.0001)  i.e. a more pronounced initial decline was associated 
with  a better chronic preservation of renal function. 
Due to  the initial decreased eGFR in subjects treated with  finerenone, eGFR values were numerically 
lower in the finerenone arm until  Month  24.  After this  timepoint, eGFR values were numerically higher 
in the finerenone arm.

Ratio to baseline of UACR 
Least square means from a mixed model analysis for the ratio to  baseline of UACR, which  include 
measurements from all subjects whether on or off study drug, show that  the finerenone treatment 
effect on UACR that  was apparent at Month  4 was sustained over the duration of the study. The LS 
mean ratio finerenone vs placebo did not  exceed 0.683 (Figure 19).

Subgroups of interest: SGLT2 inhibitors /GLP-1  receptor agonists 
The effects of finerenone in patients treated with  the novel blood glucose lowering agents SGLTi and 
GLP1-agonists are of interest. Overall, there was small subsets of patients that  were treated with 
SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists at baseline. Consequently, there were very few events for the 
primary endpoint (Figure  20).  
The applicant conducted an analysis in these subgroups concerning changes in UACR from baseline to 
month 4  where the response was similar which  is indicative of an additive effect. The same 
observations were made when evaluating the  subgroup of GLP 1 receptor agonist users at baseline. 
(Figure 21) 
In addition, long-term data on UACR was provided for the SGLT2 and GLP-1 subgroups where 
finerenone showed a comparable effect on UACR as observed in the  FAS.

New diagnosis of atrial fibrillation  or atrial flutter 
A new diagnosis of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, which was independently adjudicated by the 
Clinical Event Committee, occurred less frequently in the finerenone arm (for 82  of 2593  subjects with 
no known history of atrial fibrillation or flutter,  3.2%) than  in the placebo arm (for 117  of 2620

ARTS-HF and ARTS-HF Japan were conducted in patients  with worsening chronic heart failure (WCHF) 
and either type 2  DM with or without  CKD or moderate CKD alone whereas ARTS was conducted in 
patients with  clinical diagnosis of CHF  and CKD. 
ARTS-HF (Study 14564) 
The ARTS HF  study was a Phase 2b randomised, adaptive, double blind, double dummy, comparator 
controlled, parallel group, multi-centre study with  a planned treatment duration of 90 days. 
Participants were adult  male and female subjects with  a clinical diagnosis of worsening chronic heart 
failure (WCHF)  requiring emergency presentation to  hospital and treatment with  intravenous (IV) 
diuretics, and either type 2  DM with or without  CKD or moderate CKD alone, who were New  York Heart 
Association (NYHA)  class II to IV and treated with  evidence based therapy for heart failure (HF)  for at 
least 3 months prior to emergency presentation to hospital. 
The primary objective was to investigate efficacy (percentage of subjects with  a relative decrease in N-
terminal prohormone B-type natriuretic  peptide [NT-proBNP]  of more than 30% from baseline to Visit 
9 [Day 90±2])  and safety of different oral doses of finerenone given once daily. 
Initially, 2 doses of finerenone – 2.5  mg OD and 5 mg OD –  and eplerenone were administered in a 
double-blind manner. After the safety and tolerability of these doses had been assessed by an 
independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), 3  further doses of finerenone were introduced: 7.5 
mg, 10 mg, and 15 mg OD.  
Results 
The treatment groups were generally comparable with respect to demographic characteristics. In the 
SAF, between 74.3 and 81.0%  of subjects in each treatment group were men. The majority (89.5 to 
93.9%)  of subjects was white;  the next largest race group was Asian (3.1  to 5.8%).  Age ranged from 
33 to 92  years, with median age ranging from 70 to 74.5  years. Nearly three-quarters of subjects 
(72.3%)  had a BMI of ≥25 kg/m2. Over half of the subjects in each treatment  group were current or 
former smokers, and almost all subjects reported abstinence from alcohol or light  alcohol use.  
The primary efficacy variable, the percentage of subjects with  a relative decrease in NT-proBNP 
of >30% from baseline to Day 90,  showed that  all doses of finerenone were comparable to eplerenone. 
The responder rate was not statistically  significantly higher in  any finerenone dose group compared 
with  eplerenone. 
An exploratory efficacy objective of the study was to assess the effects on a composite clinical endpoint 
of death from any cause, CV hospitalisations, or emergency presentations for worsening CHF until  Day 
90. Further  exploratory efficacy variables included this composite and its  components.  
The composite clinical endpoint and its  components showed a broad dose-dependent trend across the 
finerenone doses from 2.5-5 mg OD to 10 20  mg OD. Survival analyses showed a decrease for 
finerenone (starting  from 5-10  mg OD), with  an improved outcome for the 10-20  mg dose arm vs. 
eplerenone (e.g. composite endpoint with  HR of 0.56,  95% CI 0.35; 0.90,  p-value 0.0157). 
ARTS-HF Japan (Study 16815) 
The ARTS HF  study was a Phase 2b randomised, adaptive, double blind, double dummy, comparator 
controlled, parallel group, multicentre study with  a planned treatment  duration of 90 days with  a 
similar design as ARTS-HF but  in a Japanese population. 
Participants were adult  male and female subjects with  a clinical diagnosis of WCHF  requiring 
emergency presentation to hospital.

The primary efficacy objective of this  study was to investigate the responder rate, defined as the 
percentage of subjects with  a relative decrease in NT-proBNP of more than 30% from baseline to Day 
90. 
Initially, 2 doses of finerenone 2.5  mg OD and 5 mg OD and eplerenone were administered in a 
double-blind manner. After the safety and tolerability of these doses had been assessed by an 
independent DMC (the first dose recommendation meeting), 3 higher dose arm of finerenone (7.5  mg, 
10mg and 15mg OD) could be introduced.  
Results 
The responder rate at Day 90  was higher in the  3 highest finerenone dose groups (7.5-15  mg OD 
45.5%;  10-20 mg OD, 27.3% and 15-20  mg OD groups, 45.5%)  compared with the  eplerenone group 
(23.1%). 
Further analyses included a composite clinical endpoint of all-cause death, CV hospitalisation or 
emergency presentation due to worsening CHF  until Day 90. Summary statistics of numbers of 
subjects for the individual components of this clinical endpoint show no clear trend across the 
finerenone dose groups; the incidences of composite endpoint events and CV hospitalisations were 
lower in the eplerenone group than  in the finerenone dose groups on Day 90. No  definitive conclusion 
can be drawn because of the low number of events and subjects. 
ARTS (Study 14563) 
The ARTS Study 14563 was a Phase 2a, randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, 
multi  centre safety study (Parts A and B), with an additional open-label active comparator for Part B. 
The planned treatment  duration was 4 weeks. 
Participants were adult  male subjects and female subjects without  childbearing potential  with clinical 
diagnosis of CHF  New York Heart  Association (NYHA)  class II - III, treated with evidenced-based 
therapy for CHF  [e.g. treatment with  beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB) as well as diuretics, unless contraindicated or not 
tolerated and CKD, mild (Part A) or moderate (Part B) chronic kidney disease. 
In Part A, 2.5  mg, 5 mg, and 10 mg BAY 94-8862  OD were compared to placebo in a double-blind 
manner. In Part B, 2.5 mg, 5 mg, 10  mg BAY 94-8862  OD (plus placebo dose in the evening), and 5 
mg BID were compared to placebo BID in a double-blind manner and to open-label spironolactone 25 
mg or 50  mg OD. 
Results 
All doses of BAY 94-8862  were assessed as safe and well tolerable. Thus, Part B was initiated. 
Based on the primary analysis of the primary variable in Part B, 10 mg finerenone OD as well as 5 mg 
finerenone BID demonstrated a significantly higher increase in serum potassium than the placebo 
group. Compared to the spironolactone group, 2.5  mg, 5 mg, and 10  mg finerenone OD as well as 5 
mg finerenone BID demonstrated a significantly smaller increase in serum potassium than the 
spironolactone group (

Table 28). 
Summary statistics for UACR (Table 29)  showed that  for all finerenone dose groups the  geometric 
mean of the ratio to baseline was consistently <1.00, suggesting  that finerenone reduced albuminuria 
when compared to placebo.

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The application is based on efficacy data from a single pivotal phase III study, FIDELIO-DKD and the 
phase II dose finding  studies ARTS-DN and ARTS-DN Japan in patients with  CKD and T2D. In addition, 
supportive data has been submitted from the ARTS-HF, ARTS-HF Japan and ARTS studies in patients 
with  CHF.  These studies provide some mechanistic information on finerenone, but  given that  they 
encompass a different patient  population, they are of less importance for the  current application. 
However, some comparative data versus eplerenone and spironolactone is provided. The design of the 
pivotal study is adequate and is in general in line with  CHMP  scientific advice provided in 2015. 
Dose selection 
The starting dose for the pivotal study was derived from the  ARTS-DN, ARTS-DN Japan studies. The 
ARTS-DN study was a randomised, adaptive, double-blind,  placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-
centre study with a treatment duration  of 90  days. Participants were male and female subjects (≥18 
years of age) with  type 2 diabetes mellitus and a clinical diagnosis of DN treated with  an ACEI and/ or 
ARB for at least 3 months. The primary objective of this study was to investigate the change in UACR 
Assessment report

from baseline to day 90  after treatment with  7 different dosing regimens of finerenone (1.25-20  mg 
OD) given once daily. UACR is commonly used as a dose-finding endpoint in CKD, given that  reduction 
in UACR with  ACE/ARBs have been shown to delay the  progression of renal impairment in CKD and 
T2D. The study demonstrated a dose-dependent reduction in UACR compared with placebo from 7.5 
mg to 20 mg OD. Post-hoc analysis in these groups demonstrated a significant reduction in UACR from 
day 30  and onwards. The study thus shows that  finerenone reduces UACR in patients with  CKD and 
T2D on top of a RAS inhibitor,  in a dose-dependent manner with the  most pronounced effect observed 
in the highest  dose studied (20  mg OD) while the increase in plasma potassium was modest.  
The ARTS-DN Japan had a similar design as ARTS-DN but  in a Japanese population. The results from 
the ARTS-DN study  together with data from the ARTS-DN Japan and the ARTS-HF study guided the 
applicant’s decision to  proceed to phase III studies with  the 10  and 20  mg OD dose. 
Main study (FIDELIO-DKD) 
The FIDELIO-DKD was a randomised, double-blind,  placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicentre, 
event-driven Phase 3 study to  study the efficacy and safety of finerenone in patients with  T2D and 
CKD. 
Subjects with CKD and T2D were enrolled. Eligible patients had to be treated with  the individual 
maximum tolerated labelled dose of either an ACEI or an ARB and had persistent high albuminuria 
(UACR ≥30 to <300 mg/g)  and eGFR 25-60  ml/min and presence of diabetic retinopathy or very high 
albuminuria (UACR ≥300 mg/g) and eGFR 25-75  mL/min. Thus, the  study population reflects the target 
population according to the proposed indication. The study design included a run-in-period between 4-
16 weeks to  allow optimisation  of SoC with  RAAS inhibitors before finerenone initiation.  The mean 
length of treatment with  either ACEIs or ARBs before recruitment was around 4 years for both the 
finerenone and placebo group (2 years in median).  The run-in-period lasted 48 days on average in 
both arms (48.14 and 48.33  days in the  finerenone and placebo group, respectively), and only a 
negligible portion of patients were not  on tolerated maximum dose before screening (1.7%  and 1.1% 
in the finerenone and placebo group, respectively). The applicant showed that variation between the 
run-in and screening visit for the clinical parameters of major interest was generally comparable 
between the finerenone and placebo groups and regardless of run-in length,  thus suggesting similar 
short-term effects of therapy adjustments in the two arms. The portion of patients  who required 
optimisation of the ACE-I/ARBs therapy during  the Run-in Period accounted for a minority of the study 
population (5.5%).  Only 5.2% in the  finerenone arm and 4.3% in  the placebo arm were administered 
an ACEI or ARB below the minimum labelled dose. The dose and type of the  different drugs were both 
balanced between treatment groups. This reassures on the  validity of data as the  inference of 
treatment was evaluated on top of a well-established and optimised long-standing  therapy equally 
distributed  between finerenone and placebo arm, thus  limiting the  possibility that  a delayed effect of 
ACE-Is/ARBs or unbalanced therapy optimisation between groups could have introduced a bias in data 
analysis and interpretation. 
Renal biopsy was not required as an entry criterium, which is in  line with  the EMA Guideline on the 
clinical investigation of medicinal products to prevent development/slow progression of chronic renal 
insufficiency (EMA/CHMP/500825/2016)  where the following is included: “As a general rule, the  renal 
biopsy is not  required if not used in general practice to set diagnosis in case of pivotal studies, e. g 
diabetic nephropathy”. However, CKD in type 2 diabetics encompasses both DKD and non-diabetic CKD 
as well as a mixed form of the  two clinical entities. The clinical data in support of the current 
application are limited  to CKD in T2D, without  distinguishing  between DKD and non-diabetic causes, 
however, patients with  known significant non-diabetic  disease were excluded, thus the  study was 
intended to include mainly patients with  DKD. The efficacy and safety of finerenone, in addition to 
standard of care, on the progression of kidney disease in patients with  non-diabetic chronic kidney

disease is studied in the ongoing study Finerenone in non-diabetic CKD (FIND-CKD) with  expected last 
patient last  visit in December 2025. 
Patients with  symptomatic heart failure (NYHA class II-IV) and reduced ejection fraction at the  run-in 
visit were excluded from the trial (due to class 1A recommendation for MRAs) but  patients with 
reduced ejection fraction at NYHA class I or symptomatic patients with  mildly reduced or preserved EF 
(HFmrEF  / HFpEF)  were included. However, the applicant claims that the ARTS-HF  phase IIb study 
provides data on the use of finerenone in  comparison with eplerenone in subjects with  HFrEF. 
However, the  study did not provide effect of treatment  on clinical outcomes, and the posology scheme 
is not consistent with  the  study design of the FIDELIO-DKD trial. The pursued indication is for 
treatment of CKD based on the  primary renal endpoints from the pivotal FIDELIO-DKD trial. Therefore, 
the available clinical data do not support the treatment  of CHF  patients. The applicant has included a 
labelling in section 5.1 of the SmPC on the  exclusion of these heart failure patients and a specific 
warning was included in the SmPC section 4.4  to inform physicians on the absence of data in patients 
with  diagnosed heart failure with  reduced ejection fraction and NYHA class II-IV in the  event that 
commercially available MRAs should be considered.  
Subjects were randomly assigned to  treatments. Although treatment was blinded, the  effect of 
finerenone on potassium level might  have unmasked it. However, increases in potassium level were 
common events in both arms given the underlying disease. It is recognised that  CKD associates with 
potassium fluctuations;  however, data clearly demonstrate a more frequent rate and high  degree of 
potassium increase in finerenone-treated patients than  placebo. In the applicant’s view, this 
phenomenon was not  a concern at the individual level considering the  advanced CKD of the FIDELIO-
DKD population. No  causes of inadvertent unblinding  due to finerenone-dependent potassium level 
modifications were envisaged, so no strategy was needed to retain the  risk of unblinding. The 
applicant’s justification is acknowledged. 
The starting dose of study drug (10  or 20 mg) depended on the eGFR level at the screening visit. Up-
titration  to the target dose of 20 mg was permitted  if serum potassium was ≤4.8 mmol/L and if eGFR 
had not decreased below a certain degree. The study drug dose could be titrated  up or down according 
to potassium response and investigators were encouraged to reach the maximum dose of 20 mg 
without  compromising safety. The dose selection rationale was based on the fixed dose Phase 2 
programme, in particular the Phase 2b ARTS-DN study where a dose-dependency was demonstrated 
for UACR (the primary efficacy parameter in that  study). A dose-exposure-responses modelling and 
simulation indicated a saturated effect at  20 mg. In terms of safety, no clear dose-dependency was 
seen for serum potassium in either healthy subjects in phase I studies or the  patients in the ARTS-DN 
study. Analyses of different groups based on baseline GFR in the  ARTS-DN study demonstrated that in 
patients with  baseline GFR ≤60 mL/min  a higher increase in serum potassium was observed in the 20 
mg group compared to the 10 mg group. This difference was not  seen in patients  with baseline GFR 
>60ml/min.  The varying response in terms of potassium guided the dose titration  rationale for the 
phase 3  study. The dose selection rationale is acknowledged and the posology is adequately reflected 
in the SmPC.  
The primary endpoint was the time to the  first occurrence of the composite endpoint of onset of kidney 
failure, a sustained decrease of eGFR ≥40% from baseline over at least 4 weeks, or renal death which 
is considered appropriate and in line with  scientific advice from CHMP. 
The key secondary endpoint was the time  to first occurrence of the composite endpoint CV death, non-
fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalisation  for heart failure, again in line with  the scientific advice by 
the CHMP.   Other secondary endpoints focused on all-cause mortality, hospitalisation and UACR as well 
as a secondary renal composite that defined a more pronounced eGFR decrease compared to the 
primary endpoint (≥57% vs. ≥40%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/78746/2022  
Page 116/159 
 
 
 
The primary and secondary endpoints are considered clinically relevant. 
The sample size was calculated based on the assumption that  a 20% relative risk reduction for the 
primary endpoint was observed with finerenone considering a 12% annual event rate in the placebo 
group. However, the hypothesis was based upon an overestimation of event rate in the  placebo group. 
As a consequence, the number of enrolled patients (13911)  largely exceeded the originally planned 
number of screenings (9600),  due to both  a higher than  expected screening failure rate (originally 
estimated in the order of 50% but  reaching 58.8%)  and the lower rate of events compared to the 
protocol assumption (a total  of 5734 patients  were recruited, compared to the expected 4600 to 
achieve the planned number of event). The majority of screening failures were attributed to  lack of a 
clinical diagnosis of DKD at the  Run-in and Screening Visit, based on either persistent high albuminuria 
and presence of diabetic retinopathy OR persistent very high albuminuria (65.7%) or potassium levels 
above cut-off levels at the  Run-in and Screening Visit (31.3%).  No concerns arise from these data. 
With  Amendment no.3,  rescreening of previous failures was allowed, even if initial  screen failure was 
due to elevated blood potassium values. The applicant also conducted an analysis to identify cases of 
rescreening and identified a total  of 505 subjects firstly screened in FIDELIO and then re-screened in 
FIDELIO of which 181 were randomised to FIDELIO, and an additional  102 subjects firstly screened in 
FIGARO and then re-screened in FIDELIO, of which 56 were randomised to FIDELIO. Main raisons for 
the initial  screen failures were levels of potassium above cut-off levels and uncontrolled hypertension. 
Drug modification occurred within 3  months from re-screening in 5 subjects in the finerenone arm and 
10 subjects in the placebo arm. Given the  limited number of patients  undergoing background therapy 
modifications before re-screening, this is not considered to  have relevant impact on either the study 
results or the  conduct of the clinical trial. 
The statistical analysis as planned could overall be agreed. No major concerns have been identified 
although there were analysis features that  could be questioned. One concerned the corrected 
stratification and the  other the  corrected database. Additional analyses were requested and in response 
the applicant performed analyses based on the original database released on June 19, 2020  with the 
re-release dated July 29, 2020.  The re-release implied an update to the number of events. The primary 
and secondary renal composites and change in UACR to month  4 was not affected while  small changes 
were observed in the key secondary CV composite endpoint, all-cause mortality and all-cause 
hospitalisation. Importantly, none of the updates had any impact on primary conclusions and thereby 
could the analyses based on the re-released DB be accepted. Further, an analysis of the original 
database using original stratification  groups (including  stratification errors) was performed. Only for 
the key secondary CV composite the HR was slightly changed. The minor change does not  affect the 
interpretation of the results. All important endpoints but  one was time-to-event  endpoints. The 
censoring mechanism of subjects without  an event of the  primary composite endpoint at  the time of 
analysis was assumed to be non-informative (implying a missing at random assumption). In the end a 
high proportion of subjects completed the study hence, the number of subjects lost to follow-up  or with 
withdrawn  consent were very few. Subjects having withdrawn  from study drug permanently were 
expected to continue to  attend all protocol specified study visits. The proportion of subjects who 
discontinued study drug permanently was approximately 29% and similar in the two arms. The 
completion of follow-up on the primary endpoint was however lower than  the study completion which, 
according to  the applicant, was mainly due to censoring rules. Follow-up  on the primary renal 
composite endpoint that included a laboratory measurement to determine the eGFR decrease, was 
incomplete/missing for 16.1%  (457/2833)  of the subjects in the finerenone arm and 14.3% 
(406/2841)  among subjects randomised to placebo. Tipping Point  (TP) analyses were performed 
(primary endpoint, key secondary endpoint) and as described for the  primary endpoint, shows how 
much higher the hazard rate after the last non-missing eGFR measurement would need to  be for 
subjects in the finerenone arm without  complete endpoint  follow-up so that  statistical  significance is

lost. Based on the TP analysis it  is agreed that the primary outcome appears robust. For the key 
secondary endpoint on CV-events the proportion of subjects with  incomplete follow-up was low 
(approximately 2.5%) and comparable between the arms. 
A weighted Bonferroni-Holm procedure was used for the primary and key secondary endpoints, 
followed by hierarchical testing  of four additional secondary efficacy endpoints. The multiple testing 
procedure is agreed. As further discussed below, statistically  significance was not achieved for the 
second secondary endpoint why the testing  of the remaining secondary efficacy variables was 
performed in an explorative manner. 
The conduct of the study raised important concerns on GCP aspects. Indeed, sixty patients  in total 
were excluded from the analysis due to serious GCP issues, related to investigator fraud and patient 
duplicate randomisations. Moreover, a substantial  number of important protocol violations occurred in 
the study (>50%  of total population, equally distributed between treatment arms). The applicant has 
provided a review of serious GCP findings and important  protocol deviations and discussed the impact 
of these protocol breaches on patient safety and data reliability of the trial. The applicant appears to 
have undertaken proper action concerning the serious GCP findings. With  reference to important 
protocol deviations, a list of breaches was provided with an associate description of more frequent 
events. Based on the  provided information, no safety concerns arise around the possibility that  these 
protocol breaches might have influenced the wellbeing of study participants; the quality and reliability 
of data do not  appear to have been compromised. 
Overall, FIDELIO-DKD is considered as a well-conducted study. 
Efficacy data  and additional analyses 
The percentage of randomised subjects that  completed the  study was high,  above 98% in both  arms. 
Baseline characteristics were similar in the  two treatment arms and reflect a population representative 
for the condition. Patients in general had elevated BMI and a medical history of hypertension. 
Approximately half of the patients  had a medical history of diabetic retinopathy and hyperlipidaemia, 
30% had coronary heart disease and 25%  had diabetic neuropathy. Although the  exclusion criteria 
allowed inclusion of patients  in very poor metabolic control (i.e. with  a HbA1c <  12%), the baseline 
mean haemoglobin A1C was 7.7%. 
The degree of blood pressure control in the study population was generally not optimal since above 
60% of recruited participants had SBP levels ranging between 130-160  mmHg.  Data suggests a 
contribution  of finerenone to BP control that  starts soon after treatment initiation  which  resulted in 
more patients  in the experimental arm achieving on-target BP values compared to  placebo (30.8% vs 
24.3%  with BP<130  mmHg at Month  1 in the finerenone and placebo arm, respectively). However, in 
both arms an increase in the  use of anti-hypertensives over time was observed, with  a rise in the 
number of patients  treated with >4  drugs in  both groups (from 40.1%  and 41.1% in the  finerenone 
and placebo arm at baseline to 50.5%  and 52.5% in the  finerenone and placebo arm at Month  36). 
Based on these observations, the contribution  to BP control exerted by finerenone can be considered 
modest. 
In the first 12 months  of treatment,  the mean reduction in SBP was approximately 3 to 4  mmHg 
greater in the  finerenone arm compared to placebo, and the  reduction was more pronounced in the 
subgroup of subjects with  a baseline SBP >160  mmHg (5 to 7  mmHg). Although of modest entity, the 
effect can be considered clinically beneficial, based on the association between BP reduction and CV 
risk reduction. Accordingly, the  applicant showed that  a proportion of the treatment effect on 
cardiorenal outcomes could be attributed  to  BP reduction. This proportion  equals to  14.0%, 12.5%

and 31.2% for the primary renal, secondary renal and key secondary CV endpoint, respectively, using 
a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for baseline SBP and SBP change from baseline to Month  4, 
and of 13.8%, 13.2%  and 12.6% in  a Cox proportional hazards model adjusted for time-varying SBP. 
The fact that the  use of anti-hypertensive drugs was similar between groups, together with  the therapy 
optimisation during  the run-in-period, provide reassurance on the similarity in BP management 
adopted in both groups, thus limiting  the risk of bias. The use of finerenone on top  of SoC led to  an 
improvement in BP control compared to placebo, which was maximum for patients  with uncontrolled 
BP. As expected, patients  with on-target BP levels at baseline presented with a reduced incidence of 
renal events compared to those with  off-target BP irrespective of treatment.  This is in line with  the 
well-established renoprotection deriving from BP control. Finerenone independently adds a beneficial 
action to the background therapy since a reduction in renal endpoints was observable regardless of BP 
category at baseline. The current data support the concept that  the target population is expected to 
benefit from finerenone regardless of BP control status,  with no impact on the  pursued indication. 
The primary endpoint was intended to support the first part of the initially  proposed indication, i.e. “to 
delay progression of kidney disease”. Treatment with  finerenone resulted in  a 17.5%  relative hazard 
reduction compared with  placebo for the  composite endpoint time to  first occurrence of kidney failure, 
a sustained decrease of eGFR ≥40%  from baseline over at least 4 weeks, or renal death (HR 0.825 
[95% CI 0.732;  0.928];  p=0.0014).  The primary endpoint of the FIDELIO-DKD study was thus met. 
The Kaplan-Meier curves did separate starting  12 months after treatment initiation,  indicating  a 
sustained effect. The absolute risk reduction based on Kaplan-Meier cumulative incidences for the 
primary renal composite endpoint was 2.9% at  24 months and 3.4% at  36 months with  finerenone 
compared to placebo, corresponding to  NNTs to prevent one primary endpoint  event of 34 and 29 
subjects, respectively. 
The effect on the primary endpoint  appears to be mainly driven by the component sustained decrease 
in eGFR ≥40% relative baseline (HR 0.815  [95% CI 0.722;  0.920];  nominally p-value=0.0009)  while 
no efficacy was reported on other clinical endpoints (kidney failure and death).  
In finerenone-treated subjects, an initial  (‘acute’) reduction in eGFR was observed compared to 
placebo, with  a difference in LS means (finerenone minus placebo) of 2.38  mL/min/1.73  m2 from 
baseline to Month  4.  According to the applicant this  finding reflects a reduced intraglomerular pressure 
due to finerenone treatment rather than intrinsic  structural damage to the  kidneys. The initial 
reduction in eGFR is anticipated based on the mode of action of finerenone and consistent with  that 
observed in ARTS DN, where these changes were observed to be reversible following treatment 
discontinuation.  Thereafter, a more attenuated decline over time in the eGFR (‘chronic’) slope was 
observed in finerenone-treated subjects compared to those on placebo. From the FIDELIO-DKD study, 
no reliable post-treatment  data is available given the study design.  
Due to  the initial decreased eGFR in subjects treated with  finerenone, eGFR values were numerically 
lower in the finerenone arm until  Month  24.  After this  timepoint, eGFR values were numerically higher 
in the finerenone arm. An ANCOVA of the chronic eGFR slope (from Month  4 until  the PD or EOS visit) 
describes a slower decline in eGFR over time with  finerenone: the  annualised difference in LS means 
(finerenone minus placebo) was 1.310  mL/min/1.73  m2 (p<0.0001).  Further  analyses across both 
treatment arms show that in the  FAS, the acute and chronic slopes are negatively correlated (Pearson 
correlation coefficient -0.227,  [95% CI 0.255; 0.198],  p <0.0001)  i.e. a more pronounced initial 
decline was associated with  a better chronic preservation of renal function,  indicating  that the decline 
has no negative long-term consequences on eGFR. 
Based on subgroup analyses, variability in magnitude of effect for the primary endpoint is noted across 
geographic areas, with  Asia displaying the highest beneficial response to treatment (HR=0.71;  95% 
CI: 0.58, 0.87)  and Europe showing only a marginal effect (HR=0.92;  0.75,  1.12). However, the 
Assessment report

secondary renal endpoint of time to first occurrence of kidney failure, sustained decrease of eGFR ≥
57% from baseline over at least 4 weeks or renal death showed a lower HR in  Europe (0.61;  95% CI 
0.44-0.83)  than  Asia (0.75;  95% CI 0.57-0.99).  Clearly the point  estimates lack precision in the 
subgroup analysis, and there is no biological plausibility as to why the two renal outcomes should be 
discordant; it can be concluded that  kidney benefit did not differ between regions. 
There is a net differentiation of response in the primary endpoint when looking at efficacy data by BMI 
levels (HR=0.68  for BMI<30 vs HR=0.98  for BMI≥30); it  should however be noted that  the control arm 
within  the BMI≥30  performed unexpectedly better than  the placebo group in the counterpart, this 
discrepancy potentially introducing a bias in data interpretation as the rate of events in patients on 
finerenone were similar for the two BMI subcategories. An additional data analysis by Cox proportional 
hazards model indicates no benefit for patients with  a BMI>35 kg/m2 (HR consistently above 1) which 
supports the previously observed lack of beneficial effect of finerenone in obese diabetics (BMI>30).  In 
comparing baseline characteristics across BMI quartiles, the only notable difference can be attributed 
to concomitant medications. In the analysis of results by concomitant medications as presented in the 
original submission, and with  reference to ACE-Is, ARBs and Beta-blockers, all of them exerting 
feedback on the compensatory RAAS activation status,  there were no observable differences between 
users and non-users in terms of finerenone response to treatment  for the primary outcome.  
History of CVD demonstrated a significant  interaction with  treatment so that  efficacy in patients 
without  prior events can be deemed absent (HR  0.94 [0.80;  1.09)]  vs. HR 0.70  [0.58;  0.84]) however 
the effect on the key secondary cardiovascular outcome was consistent in patients  with  (HR 0.85 
[0.71;  1.01]) and without  (HR  0.87 [0.69;  1.09]  a history of CVD. The comparison between groups 
(i.e. CVD present or absent) revealed similarity in  terms of clinical characteristics, the only difference 
being the use of concomitant  drugs at  baseline (particularly, beta-blockers were more frequently 
prescribed in patients with  prior CVD). The portion of patients  who experienced a CV events within  12 
weeks from study recruitment was limited  to 1.5% in the  finerenone arm (42/2833  subjects) and 1.2% 
in the placebo arm (35/2841  subjects), thus accounting  for only a minority of the group of patients 
with  history of CVD (42/1303  and 35/1302;  3.2%  in the finerenone arm and 35/1302;  2.7% in the 
placebo arm). The majority of patients with  CVD (96.5%  and 97.3% in the  finerenone and placebo 
arm, respectively) had a period from events and recruitment >12 weeks, thus  reassuring on the 
stability of the clinical conditions and background therapy of these patient  subcategory.  
About one third (34.4%)  of the total study population  was treated with  a combination of diuretics and 
beta-blockers as concomitant  medications. Within  this  subgroup of patients,  the treatment effect of 
finerenone on the primary renal endpoint was attenuated (HR of 0.93  [95% CI 0.76; 1.12])  for 
subjects with a combined therapy with  diuretic and beta-blocker at baseline; vs a HR  of 0.77  [95% CI 
0.66;  0.90] for subjects without  a combined therapy with  diuretic and beta-blocker at baseline) 
although no significant  interaction of treatment was observed. Concerning the secondary renal 
endpoint, the  effect of finerenone was consistent among groups regardless of concomitant  medications 
(i.e. users and non-users of beta-blockers, either alone or in combination with  diuretics). No distinct 
recommendations can be made based on this efficacy data for finerenone depending on concomitant 
medications. 
No benefit was reported for the primary endpoint in the  subgroup with  eGFR ≥60 ml/min/1.73  m2; this 
is not cause of concern considering that  the proposed indication is restricted to CKD stage 3 and 4. 
Furthermore, given the small number of participants in the subgroup, the point  estimate lacks 
precision. There is limited evidence to the potential advantage of finerenone on top  of SoC for patients 
with  high albuminuria (compared to very high albuminuria), not  only because of their limited 
representativeness within the overall study population  but also in view of a consistent variability in 
response that  makes the benefit of treatment  on primary outcomes quite dubitable  in this subgroup. 
While a HR < 1 was observed consistently across different ranges, confidence intervals are wide 
Assessment report  
EMA/78746/2022  
Page 120/159 
 
 
 
particularly for UACR values < 300 mg/g. The strongest beneficial effect appears for patients  in the 
highest UACR quartile given a nominal value of HR and 95% CI < 1. In comparing patient 
characteristics, patients  in the highest UACR quartile seem to present with  a more advanced stage of 
disease as suggested by a higher mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure, a lower mean eGFR and 
higher mean serum creatinine compared to those in the  lowest quartiles.  On the  other side, the 
precision of the point  estimates is likely influenced by the numerosity of the  different subgroups as well 
as the event rate, which is more frequent in  the “very high” albuminuria group compared to the “high” 
albuminuria group. Given the potential  for confounding factors, data interpretation is not univocal.   
The secondary renal composite defined a more pronounced eGFR decrease compared to the primary 
endpoint (≥57%  vs. ≥40%). Treatment with  finerenone resulted in a 23.7%  relative hazard reduction 
compared with  placebo (RR 0.763 [95%  0.648; 0.900].  Statistical  testing was considered explorative 
(p=0.0012)  given that the  hierarchical testing sequence had been broken in the previous steps. 
Treatment with  finerenone resulted in a reduced UACR from baseline to month 4 (RR 0.688  [95% CI 
0.662,  0.715];  p<0.0001  explorative). This is in  line with  results from the ARTS-DN phase II study and 
supports the reno-protective mode of action of finerenone. An ancillary analysis indicates that  this 
effect is sustained throughout  the study. 
SGLT2 inhibitors have recently been shown to have benefit for patients with  T2D and CKD. The effect 
of finerenone in patients treated with  SGLT2i is therefore of interest.  Long-term data on UACR was 
requested for these subgroups given that the  estimate for the primary endpoint  is unreliable in small 
subgroups. The applicant has provided data on UACR up to 36 months in  the subgroups of patients 
treated with  SGLT-2 inhibitors  and GLP1 agonists, respectively. In both these subgroups, finerenone 
showed a comparable effect on UACR as observed in the  FAS. Although  no definitive conclusions can 
be made on clinical benefit of finerenone in these patients, data exclude harm deriving from the 
therapy. 
In summary, a statistically significant and clinically relevant effect on CKD has been shown in support 
of the first part of the indication, i.e. “to  delay progression of kidney disease”. 
The key secondary endpoint was intended to  support the second part of the initially proposed 
indication, i.e. “to  reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity”. Treatment with 
finerenone resulted in a 14% relative hazard reduction compared with  placebo of the key secondary CV 
composite endpoint, i.e. time to CV death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalisation for heart 
failure (HR  0.860 [95%  CI 0.747;  0.989];  p=0.0339).  When analysing the components, there are 
numerical differences in favour of finerenone in CV death, non-fatal MI and hospitalisation for heart 
failure (although  the nominal p-values were above 0.05) whereas the  occurrence of stroke in the  two 
treatment arms were very similar. Although  this risk reduction observed in this  endpoint is formally 
significant, the  treatment effect is not  convincing. According to EMA guidance (CPMP/EWP/2330/99), 
applications based on one pivotal study needs to be particularly compelling with  respect to clinical 
relevance and statistical  significance. For the  key secondary (cardiovascular) endpoint, the upper limit 
of the 95% CI is close to unity  and the  p-value (0.0339)  relatively close to  the pre-specified alpha 
level. Consequently, evidence do not  demonstrate a compelling benefit of finerenone in  terms of CV 
protection; this,  in any case, can be at least partly ascribed to the renal effects of the drug given the 
intrinsic relationship between kidney disease and CV risk.  
In the prior SA, CHMP recommended the submission of both the FIDELIO-DKD and the FIGARO trials to 
support the dual indication.  The applicant has explained that  the strategy was changed given that 
significant results were obtained for both the  primary and the  secondary endpoint in  the FIDELIO-DKD 
study. The applicant has provided a high-level summary of the FIGARO-DKD trial. In this  trial, the 
primary cardiovascular endpoint was met but  not the secondary renal endpoint,  although a positive 
trend was shown. It was considered that  an assessment of the final results of the FIGARO-DKD study

is required before the CHMP  could come to a conclusion with respect to a CV indication,  in line with 
previous scientific advice. The outcome based on the single pivotal study is not considered compelling 
and is therefore not sufficient to support the  indication “to reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality 
and morbidity in adults with  CKD”. Nevertheless, the  currently available evidence reassures on the lack 
of harm deriving from treatment in  a population  of patients  who are classified at high  CV risk given the 
underlying renal disease. In this regard, the cardiovascular data from the  FIDELIO-DKD study supports 
the use of finerenone for the renal indication and therefore are reflected in  section 5.1  of the SmPC. In 
the present submission, the cardiovascular part of the initially proposed indication  has been removed. 
All-cause mortality was numerically reduced in the  finerenone arm (HR  0.895 [95%  CI 0.746;  1.075]) 
but  not statistically significant  (p=0.2348).  The risk reduction appears to be driven by a decrease in CV 
death. This finding is important  given that  it supports that  there is no general detrimental effect of 
finerenone on mortality, but  it does not  provide additional support for the  claimed reduction of 
cardiovascular mortality. 
Among the exclusion criteria, thirty days between a prior CV event and screening visit  implies that  a 
more vulnerable population than  generally contemplated was recruited into the study (i.e.  12 weeks 
since prior CV events, especially of cardiac origin, are the usual limit  for patient  recruitment in clinical 
trials evaluating stable patients  with  chronic CV conditions). Almost half of the recruited population had 
history of CV events however the  portion of patients  who experienced a CV events within  12 weeks 
from study  recruitment was limited  to 1.5% in the  finerenone arm (42/2833  subjects) and 1.2% in the 
placebo arm (35/2841  subjects), thus accounting for only a minority of the group of patients  with 
history of CVD (42/1303  and 35/1302;  3.2% in the finerenone arm and 35/1302;  2.7% in  the placebo 
arm). The majority of patients  with  CVD (96.5% and 97.3%  in the finerenone and placebo arm, 
respectively) had a length  period from events and recruitment >12 weeks, thus  reassuring on the 
stability of the clinical conditions and background therapy of these patient  subcategory. Moreover, a 
similar trend in primary and secondary endpoints can be recognised between the  >12 weeks and <12 
weeks subgroups. 
Patients with  symptomatic heart failure and reduced ejection fraction were excluded from the trial  but 
patients with  reduced ejection fraction at NYHA class I or symptomatic patients with  mildly reduced or 
preserved EF (HFmrEF/HFpEF)  were included. The number of included patients  with a history of cardiac 
failure present was 195 (6.9%)  in the finerenone group and 241 (8.5%)  in the placebo group. The 
applicant has performed an exploratory analysis of the primary endpoint and its components. 
Comparable HR:s for both  the composite and the  components were found. Thus, based on the present 
data, history of cardiac failure does not  appear to influence the treatment effect of finerenone on renal 
function.   
A similar analysis was performed for the  key secondary CV composite endpoint. As may be expected, 
the number of events were higher in the  subgroup with  a history of cardiac failure, but the  outcome for 
the composite endpoint remained numerically in favour of finerenone. The outcome was largely driven 
by a lower rate of non-fatal MIs and hospitalisations due to heart failure among patients  with a history 
of cardiac failure. 
Efficacy data from supportive studies 
ARTS-HF and ARTS-HF Japan phase 2 studies were conducted in patients with  worsening chronic heart 
failure and either type 2 DM with  or without  CKD or moderate CKD alone. The results indicate a 
comparable effect of finerenone as eplerenone on the  responder rate of NT-proBNP after 90  days 
treatment. The ARTS study was conducted in patients with  clinical diagnosis of CHF.  After 28 days of 
finerenone treatment, UACR was reduced while serum potassium was increased. Directionally 
consistent changes were observed with the  comparator spironolactone. Taken together, the data 
supports a positive effect on kidney and cardiac function in a different population.

2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The application is based on the FIDELIO-DKD study, encompassing 5674  patients with  CKD and T2D 
treated with  maximum tolerable dose of ACEi or an ARB. The primary endpoint was intended to 
support the first part of the initially  proposed indication, i.e. “to delay progression of kidney disease”. 
Treatment with  finerenone resulted in a 17.5%  relative hazard reduction compared with  placebo for 
the composite endpoint time to first occurrence of kidney failure, a sustained decrease of eGFR ≥40% 
from baseline over at least 4 weeks, or renal death. A decline in 57%  eGFR i.e., doubling  of serum 
creatinine, was incorporated in the secondary renal composite which showed a more pronounced effect 
of the treatment (RR 0.763  [95% 0.648;  0.900];  nominally p-value=0.0012).  Thus, a statistically 
significant effect on CKD has been shown in support  of the first  part of the indication  that is considered 
clinically relevant. However, the  effect size was relatively modest and driven by a reduction in  the 
number of eGFR>40%  or 57%  decays. 
The key secondary endpoint was intended to  support the second part of the initially proposed 
indication, i.e. “to  reduce the risk of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity”. Treatment with 
finerenone resulted in a 14% relative hazard reduction compared with  placebo of the key secondary CV 
composite endpoint, i.e. time to CV death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalisation for heart 
failure. Although this risk reduction observed in this  endpoint is formally significant, the  treatment 
effect is not  convincing but provide reassurance on lack of harm deriving from therapy when used for a 
renal indication.  In the prior scientific advise procedure, CHMP  recommended the submission of both 
the FIDELIO-DKD and the FIGARO trials to support the dual indication. With  the present submission, 
the applicant has provided only a high-level summary of the FIGARO-DKD trial. It was considered that 
an assessment of the final results of the  FIGARO-DKD study is required before the CHMP  could come to 
a conclusion with  respect to a CV protection part of the initially proposed indication,  in line with 
previous scientific advice. The outcome based on the single pivotal study is not considered compelling 
and is therefore not sufficient to support the  proposed cardiovascular protection part of the initially 
proposed indication. In the present submission, the cardiovascular protection part of the indication  has 
therefore been removed.  
In summary, a statistically significant effect on CKD has been shown in  support of the indication: 
“treatment of chronic kidney disease”, that  is considered clinically relevant, although the effect size 
was relatively modest. The currently proposed indication, “Kerendia is indicated for the treatment of 
chronic kidney disease (stage 3 and 4 with albuminuria) associated with  type 2 diabetes in adults.” is 
acceptable. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The safety of finerenone is evaluated in the safety analysis set (or ‘SAF’ population),  which included all 
randomised subjects who received at least 1 dose of study  drug in  the FIDELIO-DKD study. The 
evaluation of the FIDELIO-DKD study  provides information on the safety profile of finerenone in 
subjects with CKD and T2D 
2.6.8.1.  Patient  exposure 
In FIDELIO-DKD study, 2,827  subjects were treated with  finerenone for a total exposure of 6,346 
patient-years, with  2,446  subjects (87%) for at least 52 weeks, 1,632  subjects (58%)  for at least 2 
years. Mean and median duration of treatment in  the SAF were similar in  both treatment arms (about 
27 months).

 “Hyperkalaemia”, “hyponatraemia”, “hypotension” and “GFR decreased” are adequately included in 
the proposed tabulated list  of ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC. However, pruritus (common frequency) 
should also be included in the tabulated  list in 4.8  (SmPC). 
Adverse events  of special interest 
Hyperkalaemia 
The hyperkalaemia related events were described using PTs Hyperkalaemia and Blood potassium 
increased. 
The incidence of hyperkalaemia was 2 times increased for finerenone versus placebo (18.3%  vs 9.0%). 
Drug-related hyperkalaemia were reported in 11.8%  of the subjects in the  finerenone group compared 
with  4.8% in the  placebo group. Serious events of hyperkalaemia were reported more frequently for 
finerenone (1.6%)  than for placebo (0.4%).  Moreover, a higher incidence of hyperkalaemia leading to 
discontinuation  (2.3% vs 0.9%) and hospitalisation (1.4%  vs 0.3%) was reported for finerenone 
compared with  placebo (Table 33). 
More subjects treated with  finerenone, compared with  placebo, reported one AE (11.9%  vs 6.6%),  two 
AEs (4.3% vs 1.8%) and three AEs (1.5%  vs 0.5%)  of hyperkalaemia, respectively (Table 34).  
A higher incidence for finerenone, than for placebo, had changes in serum potassium to >5.5 mmol/L 
(21.4%  vs 9.2%)  and to >6.0 mmol/L  (4.5% vs 1.4%), respectively, at any time  during treatment 
(Table 33).  
The majority of cases with  hyperkalaemia/ blood potassium increased recovered; however, in about 
12% (62/527)  of the cases of hyperkalaemia the outcome was reported as not recovered/not resolved 
(Table 35)  
The incidence of hyperkalaemia (including hospitalisation due to hyperkalaemia) increased with 
decreasing renal function.   The risk for serious events of hyperkalaemia could be handled with 
precautionary measures addressed in the  SmPC, i.e. routine risk minimisation.

Worsening of renal function 
The incidence of ‘eGFR decreased’ was increased for finerenone (6.3%)  compared with  placebo 
(4.7%).  The incidence of AEs from the SOC Renal and urinary disorders (18.5%  vs 19.5%)  was slightly 
higher for placebo, of which  the incidence of acute kidney injury (4.6% vs 4.8%) was balanced. 
However, the  incidence of drug-related events of ‘eGFR decreased’ (1.4% vs 0.5%) and AEs from the 
SOC Renal and urinary disorders (3.0% vs 2.3%),  including acute kidney injury (1.2% vs 0.6%), was 
increased for finerenone versus placebo (Table 36).   The outcome was reported as resolved/recovered 
in the majority of finerenone drug-related cases of AKI. The action taken was “no dose change” in half 
of the cases (17/34)  and a “dose change” in 2 of the cases. The drug was interrupted in  11 cases and 
was withdrawn in  4 of the  cases. 
Treatment emergent SAEs from the SOC Renal and urinary disorders of renal events (4.7% vs 5.1%), 
including acute kidney injury (2.0%  vs 1.8%)  was balanced. The incidence of treatment emergent 
serious events of eGFR decreased was low but  numerically higher for finerenone (0.2%)  than for 
placebo (0.1%). 
Information on decreased eGFR is included in  section 4.8  of the  SmPC.

The incidence of treatment emergent SAEs was slightly higher in the placebo group (34.3%)  than in 
the finerenone group (31.9%)  and drug-related treatment emergent SAEs slightly higher for 
finerenone (1.7%)  than for placebo (1.2%).  The most frequently reported treatment emergent SAEs 
for finerenone versus placebo were pneumonia (2.5% vs 3.6%), acute kidney injury (2.0%  vs 1.8%) 
and hyperkalaemia (1.5% vs 0.4%).

Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
A decrease in mean haemoglobin (<0.15  g/dL) and mean haematocrit (<0.45%)  levels was observed 
in the first 4  months in the finerenone arm compared to placebo (Figure 22).  Decreased haemoglobin 
has been included in the tabulated  list of adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC.

Serum sodium 
An initial decrease in mean serum sodium (approximately 0.7 mmol/L) was observed in the 
finerenone-treated subjects in the first month  of treatment  compared to placebo, followed thereafter 
by a progressive gradual increase over time in both  treatment groups, although  the increase observed 
was smaller in the finerenone group (Figure 23).

Serum potassium 
An increase from baseline in  mean serum potassium in the  first month of treatment of approximately 
0.2 mmol/L was observed in the finerenone arm compared to placebo, with  a maximum between-
group difference of 0.23  mmol/L observed at Month  4, and stable mean measurements thereafter in 
the finerenone arm.

Vital signs 
Blood pressure 
 Treatment with  finerenone resulted in mean reductions in SBP and DBP from baseline compared to 
placebo. Placebo-adjusted LS-mean difference for finerenone was consistent over time: -3.84/-1,74 
mmHg (month  4), -3,27/-1,18  mmHg  (month 16),  -3,08/-1.09  mmHg (month  28), -2.49/-0.62 
(month  40) and -2.21/-1,52  (month  44). Mean reductions in SBP were approximately 2 to  4 mmHg 
greater in finerenone-treated subjects compared with  placebo and mean reductions in DBP 
approximately 1 to 2 mmHg greater in the finerenone group compared to placebo (Table 38, Table 39).

Heart  rate 
Overall, no clinically relevant effect on heart rate was observed based on mean and median changes 
during treatment. In both  treatment arms, mean change from baseline fluctuated around 0 over the 
course of the study. 
ECG 
In the FIDELO-DKD study, a 12-lead ECG was to be obtained if serum potassium levels exceeded 6.5 
mmol/L. In the study, 60  subjects (41  on finerenone and 19  subjects on placebo) were identified with 
serum potassium >6.5  mmol/L and were further obtained with  ECG measurements.  ECG findings of 
“normal or normal variant” were reported in 25 subjects (19/41  subjects on finerenone vs 6/19  on 
placebo) and “sinus rhythm”  were reported in 55  subjects (38/41  on finerenone vs 17/19  on placebo). 
Abnormal findings were reported in 35 subjects (22/41  on finerenone vs 13/19  on placebo), and the 
following ECG findings were considered likely to be related to hyperkalaemia: e.g. peaked T-waves, 
bundle branch block, bradycardia, sinus bradycardia and 1st degree AV block.  
Of the 60 subjects in total  (41 on finerenone and 19 subjects on placebo), 6 subjects had more than 
one ECG within  three days of reported hyperkalaemia of which 3 in  the finerenone group; 2 subjects 
had two ECG recordings, one reported as “normal sinus rhythm” and one reported “sinus rhythm and 
right bundle branch block” and 1  subject had 3 ECGs reported as “normal sinus rhythm”.  The revealed 
“sinus rhythm and right bundle branch block” was recorded in the medical history and was confirmed 
at baseline in  that patient.

 The number of any AEs was slightly higher in finerenone group compared with  placebo across all the 
BMI categories. However, SAEs were comparable between finerenone and placebo or slightly  lower for 
finerenone in some subgroups. The slight difference between finerenone and placebo did not  have any 
impact on safety across the BMI subgroups.

2.6.8.5.  Safety  in special populations 
Effect by age 
In FIDELIO-DKD, TEAE categories were analysed by age group <65 (n=2,372),  65 to 74 (n=2,394) 
and ≥75 years (n=892).   
The reporting rate was overall similar across the age groups. Slightly more SAEs were reported in the 
age group ≥75  years (35.0% vs 38.0%) compared to subjects 65-74  years (32.6% vs 32.7%) and 
<65 years (30.1%  vs 34.1%);  however, the incidence of SAEs was higher for placebo than  for 
finerenone in all age groups. More subjects discontinued due to an AE in  for finerenone compared with 
placebo in the  subgroups ≥75  years (9.5% vs 5.6%)  and 65-74 years (8.1%  vs 6.3%);  however, the 
discontinuation  rate due to AEs was balanced (5.7%  vs 5.6%)  in subjects <65  years (  Table 41).   
The incidence of subjects discontinuing permanently due to  hyperkalaemia was increased for 
finerenone compared to placebo across age groups with  the highest  incidence in the subgroup ≥75 
years (3.9% vs 0.7%) (Table 42).

Effect by sex 
No notable differences between males and females, apart from that  the incidence of subjects that 
discontinued due to an AE was increased for finerenone compared with  placebo (8.0% vs 5.8%)  in 
males and was more balanced in  females (5.9% than 6.2%). 
Effect by race 
The rate of AEs was similar between the treatment arms across the race groups; however, the 
incidence of AEs was about 85%-89%  in White, Black and Other subjects and was slightly  higher in 
Asian subjects (93%).  The difference was mainly driven by a higher number of subjects with  AEs of 
mild intensity  in the Asian race group (38%-41%)  compared to the  other race groups (19%-27%). 
Effect by hepatic  impairment 
The applicant has presented an overall summary by hepatic impairment: “subjects with  no hepatic 
impairment” (n=4,764)  and “subjects with  hepatic impairment” (n=894)  (Table 43).   Subjects with 
hepatic impairment had an overall slightly  higher incidence of AEs (92.3%  vs 92.0%)  and SAEs (39.1% 
vs 40.1%)  compared with  subjects with no hepatic impairment (86.4%  vs 86.2%  and 30.6% vs 
33.2%).

Effect by renal  impairment 
In the study population, approximately 2.3%  of the subjects had baseline eGFR<25 mL/min/1.73m2, 
53% eGFR 25 -<45  mL/min/1.73m2,  34% eGFR 45 - <60  mL/min/1.73m2  and 12% eGFR eGFR>60 
mL/min/1.73m2.   
The incidence of AEs and SAEs for finerenone versus placebo was similar in subjects with  eGFR 25 -
<45 mL/min/1.73m2(88.2%  vs 88.9%  and 31.8%  vs 35.3%)  and eGFR 45  - <60 mL/min/1.73m2 
(86.8%  vs 86.2%  and 32.6% and 33.2%).   However, the incidence of study-drug related AEs and 
SAEs was increased for finerenone compared with placebo and slightly  higher in  the subgroup with 
eGFR 25 -<45  mL/min/1.73m2 (25.3%  vs 17.4%  and 2.0% vs 1.5%) than in  the eGFR 45 - <60 
mL/min/1.73m2 (19.9%  vs 13.9% and 1.4%  vs 0.9%).  Moreover, the incidence of subjects with any 
AE leading to  discontinuation of study drug was increased for finerenone compared with  placebo and 
slightly higher in subjects with  eGFR 25  -<45 mL/min/1.73m2  (8.2% vs 6.3%) than  in subjects with 
eGFR 45 - <60 mL/min/1.73m2  (6.0% vs 5.0%)  (Table 44).  Additionally, the risk of hyperkalaemia 
increased with decreasing renal function across eGFR strata: ≥60 (10.7% vs 8.6%), 45 -<60  (14.7%  vs 
6.3%)  and 25  -45 (22.1%  vs 10.6%)  (Table 45).  The FIDELIO-DKD study did not include any follow-up 
of eGFR after discontinuation  of treatment. An off-treatment slope was calculated from available data, 
by assessing the difference between the last available eGFR measurement before last intake of study 
drug and the first available eGFR measurement after last intake of study drug, indicating reversibility 
of eGFR decline in the overall population but  not for the subgroup with eGFR <25.   Furthermore, 
follow-up data from the phase 2b ARTS-DN study did show that eGFR values tended to return to 
baseline after discontinuation  of 3 months  treatment.

eGFR,  UACR, frequency of ESRD across eGFR strata 
An initial decrease in eGFR was observed for subjects in the finerenone arm with  a mean difference 
between finerenone and placebo of approximately 2 to  3 mL/min/1.73  m2 up to Month  4 and, 
thereafter, an attenuated  decline in eGFR was observed in the finerenone group compared to placebo.  
eGFR over time 
Line graphs showing model-adjusted mean changes from baseline in eGFR over time are provided for 
the subgroups of patients with  baseline eGFR >60, 45─≤60,  25─≤45  and < 25 mL/min/1.73  m2 in 
Figures below.

There was an initial decrease in eGFR in the finerenone group compared with placebo group, across the 
subgroups eGFR >60,  45─≤60  and 25─≤45  mL/min/1.73  m2, with  a more pronounced magnitude in 
eGFR decrease in the subgroups with  higher baseline eGFR, i.e. eGFR >60  and 45─≤60,  compared with 
the eGFR 25─≤45  group. Over time,  the eGFR declined more in the  placebo group than in the 
finerenone group, apart from the subgroup eGFR 45─≤60 in  which the eGFR seemed to decline similar 
for finerenone and placebo. The steepness of the  eGFR plot  in the finerenone group was attenuated 
over time across the eGFR subgroups; although, the eGFR decline was slightly  steeper in the subgroup

eGFR 45 to ≤60  compared to the eGFR 25 to ≤45  and eGFR >60 from month 28  an onwards. 
However, treatment  effects with  regards to primary and secondary renal composite endpoints were 
reached, thus the  data does not evoke any concerns regarding efficacy.  
In the subjects with eGFR <25ml/min/1.73m2,  the  eGFR for finerenone increased and remained above 
or near baseline until  about month 24.  Between month  24 and month 36  both finerenone and placebo 
remined close to baseline and thereafter the  eGFR decreased in the finerenone group but remained at 
baseline in the  placebo group. However, data in this  subgroup should be interpreted with  caution due 
to the low  number of subjects.  
UACR over time 
Line graphs showing model-adjusted mean changes from baseline in UACR over time are provided for 
the subgroups of patients with  baseline eGFR eGFR >60,  45─≤60,  25─≤45 and < 25  mL/min/1.73  m2 
in Figures below.

Figure 33. Line plot for least square means of UACR (mg/g) values  by visit and by baseline

Treatment with  finerenone was associated with a greater reduction in UACR for finerenone compared 
with  placebo across the subgroups; eGFR >60,  eGFR 45─≤60 and eGFR 25─≤45.  The difference in 
UACR between finerenone and placebo was maintained throughout  the duration of the study. In the 
subgroup eGFR ≤25,  the LS mean ratio to  baseline of UACR was initially decreased for finerenone 
compared with  placebo; however, from month 24 until  month 36  the reduction in UACR was similar for 
finerenone and placebo. 
Frequency of ESRD 
The frequency of ESRD was increased in the  subgroups eGFR <25 and eGFR 25─≤45  compared with 
the subgroups eGFR ≥45─≤60  and eGFR >60. The frequency of ESRD was higher in the placebo group 
compared with  the finerenone group across the subgroups, except for the  subgroup eGFR <25 where 
the frequency was higher for finerenone than  for placebo (Table 46).

Subgroup eGFR <25  mL/min/1.73  m2 
Finerenone is not recommended in subjects with  eGFR <25 mL/min/1.73m2  due to limited data. The 
incidence of study-drug related AEs was further increased for finerenone compared with placebo in  this 
subgroup (31.8% vs 15.9%)  and study-drug  related SAEs was increased for both  finerenone and 
placebo (3.0%  vs 2.9%).  Moreover, a higher incidence of subjects, compared to subjects with  eGFR 
>25 mL/min/1.73m2,  discontinued  due to  an AE (18.2%  vs 11.6%)  and an SAE (10.6%  vs 8.7%)  for 
finerenone compared with  placebo in in this  subgroup. Additionally, the  incidence of ESRD was more 
frequent in the finerenone than  in the placebo group and treatment with  finerenone was not associated 
with  a greater reduction in UACR compared with  placebo over time (Table 46).  Since no beneficial 
effects on CV events is observed in patients treated with  finerenone who have developed renal failure, 
continued treatment  of patients  with eGFR<15  mL/min is not recommended. The posology was 
updated to state that  treatment should be discontinued in patients  who have progressed to ESRD 
(eGFR <15). 
2.6.8.6.  Immunological events 
N/A 
2.6.8.7.  Safety  related  to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
According to the  applicant, concomitant use of finerenone with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. 
itraconazole, ketoconazole, ritonavir, nelfinavir, cobicistat, clarithromycin, telithromycin or nefazodone) 
is expected to result in greater than  5-fold increase in finerenone plasma concentration and is 
contraindicated. The concomitant use of moderate or strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. efavirenz, 
rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, phenobarbital, St John’s Wort) is not  recommended because 
finerenone plasma concentrations may be reduced and result in a decrease in efficacy.   
Concomitant use of finerenone with medications that  impair potassium excretion and increase serum 
potassium, may increase the risk of hyperkalemia. In FIDELIO-DKD, the following agents could be used 
with  caution: trimethoprim, or trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole and potassium supplements. 
2.6.8.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse  events 
Adverse events resulting in permanent discontinuation of study drug were reported more frequently in 
the finerenone group (7.3%)  than in the placebo group (5.9%).  The difference was driven by the 
higher number of subjects permanently discontinuing  study drug due to hyperkalemia for finerenone 
(1.8%)  compared with placebo (0.7%).

2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety of finerenone is evaluated in the safety analysis set (or ‘SAF’ population),  which included all 
randomised subjects who received at least 1 dose of study  drug in  the FIDELIO-DKD study. The 
evaluation of the FIDELIO-DKD study  provides information on the safety profile of finerenone in 
subjects with CKD and T2D. 
In FIDELIO-DKD study, 2,827  subjects were treated with  finerenone for a total exposure of 6,346 
patient-years, with  2,446  subjects (87%) for at least 52 weeks, 1,632  subjects (58%)  for at least 2 
years. Mean and median duration of treatment in  the SAF were similar in  both treatment arms (about 
27 months). 
The number of AEs was balanced for finerenone (87.3%)  and placebo (87.5%);  however, the incidence 
of drug-related AEs was increased for finerenone (22.9%)  compared with  placebo (15.9%).  The most 
commonly reported AEs that  were reported more for frequently for finerenone than  for placebo were 
hyperkalaemia (18.3% vs 9.0%),  decreased GFR (6.3%  vs 4.7%),  anaemia (7.4%  vs 6.7%), 
hypotension (4.5% vs 3.1%) and hyponatremia (1.3%  vs 0.6%).   
The incidence of SAEs was slightly higher in the placebo group (34.3%)  than  in the finerenone group 
(31.9%)  and drug-related SAEs slightly  higher for finerenone (1.7%)  than for placebo (1.2%).  The 
most frequently reported SAEs for finerenone versus placebo were pneumonia (2.5% vs 3.6%),  acute 
kidney injury (2.0% vs 1.8%) and hyperkalaemia (1.5% vs 0.4%).  There were more fatal cases in the 
placebo group compared with  the finerenone group (4.8% vs 3.1%). 
Discontinuation rate due to AE was higher for finerenone (7.3%)  than for placebo (5.9%) in  the 
FIDELIO-DKD study.  The most frequently reported AE leading to study drug discontinuation  for 
finerenone vs placebo was hyperkalaemia (2.3% vs 0.9%).  
Hyperkalaemia 
Assessment report  
EMA/78746/2022  
Page 144/159 
 
 
 
 
 
The incidence of hyperkalaemia was 2 times increased for finerenone versus placebo (18.3%  vs 9.0%). 
Drug-related hyperkalaemia were reported in 11.8%  of the subjects in the  finerenone group compared 
with  4.8% in the  placebo group. Serious events of hyperkalaemia were reported more frequently for 
finerenone (1.6%)  than for placebo (0.4%).  Moreover, a higher incidence of hyperkalaemia leading to 
discontinuation  (2.3% vs 0.9%) and hospitalisation (1.4%  vs 0.3%) was reported for finerenone 
compared with  placebo. 
More subjects treated with  finerenone, compared with  placebo, reported one AE (11.9%  vs 6.6%),  two 
AEs (4.3% vs 1.8%) and three AEs (1.5%  vs 0.5%)  of hyperkalaemia, respectively.  
A higher incidence for finerenone, than for placebo, had changes in serum potassium to >5.5 mmol/L 
(21.4%  vs 9.2%)  and to >6.0 mmol/L  (4.5% vs 1.4%), respectively, at any time  during treatment.  
The majority of cases with  hyperkalaemia/ blood potassium increased recovered/resolved; however, in 
about 12% (62/527)  of the cases of hyperkalaemia the outcome was reported as not recovered/not 
resolved. 
Hyponatraemia 
Hyponatremia, although less frequent than  hyperkalaemia, was more frequent for finerenone (1.3%) 
than for placebo (0.6%).   
Decreased eGFR and renal events 
The incidence of ‘eGFR decreased’ was increased for finerenone (6.3%)  compared with  placebo 
(4.7%).  The incidence of AEs from the SOC Renal and urinary disorders (18.5%  vs 19.5%)  was slightly 
higher for placebo, of which  the incidence of acute kidney injury (4.6% vs 4.8%) was balanced. 
However, the  incidence of drug-related events of ‘eGFR decreased’ (1.4% vs 0.5%) and AEs from the 
SOC Renal and urinary disorders (3.0% vs 2.3%),  including acute kidney injury (1.2% vs 0.6%), was 
increased for finerenone versus placebo. 
TESAEs of renal events (4.7%  vs 5.1%),  including acute kidney injury (2.0% vs 1.8%) was balanced. 
The incidence of serious events of eGFR decreased was low but  numerically higher for finerenone 
(0.2%)  than for placebo (0.1%). 
Hypotension 
Hypotension occurred more frequently in subjects in the finerenone group (4.5%) than  in the placebo 
group (3.1%). Events associated with  hypotension such as dizziness (5.2%  vs 5.4%),  syncope (1.2% 
vs 2.0%)  and events of fall (1.6% vs 2.0%) was balanced between the  groups.  
Serious hypotension was balanced between the groups (0.2%  vs 0.2%). 
Anaemia 
Anaemia was slightly increased for finerenone (7.4%) compared with  placebo (6.7%);  see also section 
3.5 laboratory findings.  Serious anaemia, however, was low and balanced (0.5% vs 0.7%).  
Gastrointestinal haemorrhage 
More  patients  in  the  finerenone  group  compared  to  placebo  had  oral  and  gastrointestinal  tract 
haemorrhage. In patients with history of GI disorders the incidence was 3.9%  vs 2.5% for finerenone vs 
placebo, respectively; however, alternative explanations could be found in  the majority of cases.  
Malignancies 
Assessment report

Page 145/159 
 
 
 
In the FIDELIO-DKD study, the incidence of AEs in the SOC Neoplasms (classified as benign, malignant 
or unspecified) was 7.3% for finerenone and 7.0% for placebo.  
Laboratory findings, vital signs 
Haematocrit 
A decrease in mean haemoglobin (<0.15  g/dL) and mean haematocrit (<0.45%)  levels was observed 
in the first 4  months in the finerenone arm compared to placebo.  Decreased haemoglobin has been 
included in the tabulated  list of adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Blood pressure 
In the first 12 months  of treatment,  the mean reduction in SBP was approximately 2 to 4  mmHg 
greater in finerenone-treated subjects compared with  placebo, and the mean reduction in  DBP 
approximately 1 to 2 mmHg greater in the finerenone group compared to placebo. 
Subgroups 
Effect by age 
The reporting rate was overall similar across the age groups. Slightly more SAEs were reported in the 
age group ≥75  years (35.0% vs 38.0%) compared to subjects 65-74  years (32.6% vs 32.7%) and 
<65 years (30.1%  vs 34.5%);  however, the incidence of SAEs was higher for placebo than  for 
finerenone in all age groups. 
More subjects discontinued  due to  an AE in for finerenone compared with  placebo in the subgroups 
≥75 years (9.5%  vs 5.6%)  and 65-74 years (8.1%  vs 6.3%);  however, the discontinuation  rate due to 
AEs was balanced (5.7% vs 5.6%) in subjects <65  years. The incidence of subjects discontinuing 
permanently due to hyperkalaemia was increased for finerenone compared to placebo across age 
groups with the  highest incidence in  the subgroup ≥75  years (3.9% vs 0.7%). 
Effect by sex 
No notable differences between males and females, apart from that  the incidence of subjects that 
discontinued due to an AE was increased for finerenone compared with  placebo (8.0% vs 5.8%)  in 
males and was more balanced in  females (5.9% than 6.2%). 
Effect by race 
The rate of AEs was similar between the treatment arms across the race groups; however, the 
incidence of AEs was about 85%-89%  in White, Black and Other subjects and was slightly  higher in 
Asian subjects (93%).  The difference was mainly driven by a higher number of subjects with  AEs of 
mild intensity  in the Asian race group (38%-41%)  compared to the  other race groups (19%-27%) 
Effect by renal function 
In the study population, approximately 2.3%  of the subjects had baseline eGFR<25 mL/min/1.73m2, 
53% eGFR 25 -<45  mL/min/1.73m2,  34% eGFR 45 - <60  mL/min/1.73m2 and 12% eGFR eGFR>60 
mL/min/1.73m2.   
The incidence of AEs and SAEs for finerenone versus placebo was similar in subjects with  eGFR 25 -
<45 mL/min/1.73m2  (AEs; 88.2%  vs SAEs; 88.9% and 31.8%  vs 35.3%)  and eGFR 45  - <60 
mL/min/1.73m2 (AEs; 86.8%  vs 86.2%  and SAEs; 32.6%  and 33.2%).   However, the incidence of 
study-drug related AEs and SAEs was increased for finerenone compared with placebo and slightly 
higher in the subgroup with  eGFR 25  -<45 mL/min/1.73m2  (AEs; 25.3%  vs 17.4% and SAEs; 2.0%  vs 
1.5%)  than in the eGFR 45 - <60  mL/min/1.73m2 (19.9%  vs 13.9%  and 1.4% vs 0.9%). Moreover, 
Assessment report  
EMA/78746/2022  
Page 146/159 
 
 
 
the incidence of subjects with  any AE leading to discontinuation  of study drug was increased for 
finerenone compared with  placebo and slightly higher in subjects with  eGFR 25 -<45  mL/min/1.73m2 
(8.2%  vs 6.3%)  than in subjects with  eGFR 45  - <60 mL/min/1.73m2  (6.0% vs 5.0%).  
Additionally, the risk of hyperkalaemia increased with decreasing renal function across eGFR strata: 
eGFR ≥60  (10.7% vs 8.6%), eGFR 45 -<60 (14.7%  vs 6.3%) and eGFR 25 -45 (22.1%  vs 10.6%).   
Finerenone is not recommended in subjects with  eGFR <25 mL/min/1.73m2  due to limited data. The 
incidence of AEs was slightly higher placebo than for finerenone; however, the incidence of study-drug 
related AEs was two times increased for finerenone compared with placebo in this subgroup (31.8%  vs 
15.9%).  SAEs were reported more frequently for placebo (52.2%)  than for finerenone (34.8%)  and 
drug-related SAEs was balanced for finerenone and placebo (3.0% vs 2.9%). A higher incidence of 
subjects, compared to subjects with eGFR >25 mL/min/1.73m2,  discontinued  due to  an AE (18.2%  vs 
11.6%)  and an SAE (10.6%  vs 8.7%)  for finerenone compared with  placebo in in this  subgroup. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The FIDELIO-DKD study provides information on the  safety profile of finerenone in subjects with 
chronic kidney disease and T2D. 
In the overall population, the number of AEs was balanced; however, the incidence of drug-related AEs 
was higher for finerenone than  for placebo. The incidence of SAEs was slightly  higher for placebo 
versus finerenone, and drug-related SAEs was slightly higher for finerenone versus placebo. There 
were more fatal cases in the placebo group than in the  finerenone group. 
The major safety concern is the  increased incidence of hyperkalaemia in the overall population (18.3% 
vs 9.0%).  The risk of hyperkalaemia increased with decreasing renal function. Moreover, SAEs of 
hyperkalaemia were reported more frequently for finerenone than for placebo and a higher incidence of 
hyperkalaemia leading to discontinuation  and to  hospitalisation was reported for finerenone compared 
with  placebo. However, the  risk for serious events of hyperkalaemia could be handled with 
precautionary measures addressed in the  SmPC, i.e. routine risk minimisation. 
The incidence of ‘eGFR decreased’ was increased for finerenone compared with  placebo. The incidence 
of drug-related events of ‘eGFR decreased’ and drug-related renal AEs, including acute kidney injury, 
was increased for finerenone versus placebo. The outcome was reported as resolved/recovered in the 
majority of finerenone drug-related cases of AKI. The action taken was “no dose change” in half of the 
cases (17/34)  and a “dose change” in 2 of the cases. The drug was interrupted in  11 cases and was 
withdrawn  in 4 of the cases. Information on decreased eGFR is included in  section 4.8  of the  SmPC. 
There was an initial decrease in eGFR in the finerenone group compared with placebo group, across the 
subgroups eGFR >60,  45─≤60  and 25─≤45  mL/min/1.73  m2, with  a more pronounced magnitude in 
eGFR decrease in the subgroups with  higher baseline eGFR, i.e. eGFR >60  and 45─≤60,  compared with 
the eGFR 25─≤45  group. Over time,  the eGFR declined more in the  placebo group than in the 
finerenone group, apart from the subgroup eGFR 45─≤60 in  which the eGFR seemed to decline similar 
for finerenone and placebo. The steepness of the  eGFR plot  in the finerenone group was attenuated 
over time across the eGFR subgroups; although, the eGFR decline was slightly  steeper in the subgroup 
eGFR 45 to ≤60  compared to the eGFR 25 to ≤45  and eGFR >60 from month 28  an onwards. 
However, treatment  effects with  regards to primary and secondary renal composite endpoints were 
reached, thus the  data does not evoke any concerns regarding efficacy. 
Finerenone is not recommended in subjects with  eGFR <25 mL/min/1.73m2  due to limited data.  The 
posology states that  treatment should be discontinued in patients who  have progressed to ESRD (eGFR 
<15 mL/min/1.73  m2).

2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with  target patient  groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that  the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in  the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU)  726/2004,  Kerendia (finerenone) is included in the 
additional monitoring list  as it  contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011,  was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.   
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that  this will  allow quick identification  of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The agreed therapeutic indication for finerenone is: 
“Kerendia is indicated for the treatment of chronic kidney disease (stage 3 and 4 with  albuminuria) 
associated with  type 2 diabetes in adults.” 
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are each independently major global health 
concerns. In 2017,  approximately 451 million patients worldwide were diagnosed with  T2D, and this 
number is expected to grow to 693 million by 2045.  An estimated 20  to 40% of T2D patients develop 
CKD which  is characterised by progressive damage and irreversible loss of function in the  kidney 
eventually leading to kidney failure. T2D is the leading cause of kidney failure in developed countries. 
Worldwide rates of end stage renal disease (ESRD) are projected to rise in  parallel with  the substantial 
increase in T2D prevalence. CKD is also associated with  increased risks of cardiovascular (CV) 
mortality and morbidity, as well as impaired quality of life. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
For the treatment  of CKD associated with T2D, ACEis and ARBs constitute  the current standard of care. 
SGLT2-inhibitors, initially  approved in 2013 for improving glycaemic control in T2D, have recently been 
shown to provide additional kidney and cardiovascular benefits in patients with  CKD and T2D. CKD in 
T2D is progressive and irreversible with a close connection to ESRD and cardiovascular disease, leading 
to the need for renal replacement therapy.  
Assessment report  
EMA/78746/2022  
Page 150/159 
 
 
 
 
The pathophysiology of CKD in T2D is multifactorial and there is a need for further effective therapies 
to address the complex and numerous underlying disease mechanisms. 
Finerenone is a novel, non-steroidal and selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR)  antagonist. The 
steroidal hormones, aldosterone and cortisol, are natural ligands of the  MR. Overactivation of the MR 
contributes to organ damage found in CKD, HF and hypertension, through mediation of pro-
inflammatory and pro-fibrotic effects, as well as via sodium retention and endothelial dysfunction. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy submitted is a phase III randomised, placebo-controlled, multicentre 
study comparing finerenone (n=2833)  with placebo (n=2841)  in addition to standard of care in 
patients with  T2D and CKD with  albuminuria.  
The study was event-driven and the  primary objective was to demonstrate that  finerenone is superior 
to placebo in  delaying the progression of kidney disease, as measured by the primary composite 
endpoint of time to first occurrence of kidney failure, a sustained decrease of eGFR ≥40% from baseline 
over at least 4 weeks, or renal death.  
The secondary objective was to demonstrate that  finerenone is superior to placebo in reducing the risk 
of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity, as measured by the composite endpoint  of time  to CV death, 
non-fatal MI, non-fatal  stroke, or hospitalisation  for heart failure. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Primary endpoint 
Treatment with  finerenone resulted in a 17.5%  relative risk reduction compared with  placebo of the 
composite primary endpoint (HR 0.825  [95% CI 0.732;  0.928]; p=0.0014).  The primary endpoint  of 
the FIDELIO-DKD study was thus  met. The effect appears to be mainly driven by the component 
sustained decrease in eGFR ≥40%  relative baseline (HR 0.815  [95%  CI 0.722;  0.920];  p=0.0009). 
The other components were numerically reduced but the  changes were not  significant. 
Kaplan-Meier curves for the primary endpoint for finerenone and placebo are similar up until  Month  12 
but  diverge thereafter indicating a sustained treatment effect after this  timepoint.  The absolute risk 
reduction based on Kaplan-Meier cumulative incidences for the primary renal composite endpoint  was 
2.9% at  Month  24 and 3.4% at Month  36 with  finerenone compared to placebo, corresponding to NNTs 
to prevent one primary endpoint event of 34 and 29 subjects, respectively. 
Secondary endpoints 
Treatment with  finerenone resulted in a 14%  relative risk reduction compared with  placebo for the  key 
secondary CV composite endpoint time to CV death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, or hospitalisation 
for heart failure (HR 0.860  [95% CI 0.747;  0.989]; p=0.0339).  When analysing the components, the 
effect appears to be equally driven by CV death, non-fatal MI and hospitalisation  for heart failure 
(although  the differences in any of the groups were not statically significant)  whereas the occurrences 
of stroke in the two  treatment arms were very similar.  
The secondary renal composite endpoint defined a more pronounced eGFR decrease compared to the 
primary endpoint (≥57%  vs. ≥40%). Treatment with  finerenone resulted in a 23.7% relative risk 
reduction compared with  placebo (RR 0.763  [95%  0.648; 0.900];  nominally p-value=0.0012) 
supporting the primary endpoint. 
Assessment report  
EMA/78746/2022  
Page 151/159 
 
 
 
Treatment with  finerenone resulted in a reduced UACR from baseline to month 4 (RR 0.688  [95% CI 
0.662,  0.715];  nominally p-value<0.0001).  This is in line with  results from the ARTS-DN phase II 
study and supports the reno-protective mode of action of finerenone. 
In summary, directionally consistent  changes were observed for all secondary endpoints, but  a 
statistically significant  change in line with  the hierarchical testing  strategy was only found for the  key 
secondary endpoint. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In finerenone-treated subjects, an initial  reduction in eGFR was observed compared to placebo. The 
initial  reduction in eGFR is anticipated based on the mode of action of finerenone and consistent with 
that  observed in ARTS DN,  where these changes were observed to be reversible following treatment 
discontinuation.  Thereafter, a more attenuated decline over time in the eGFR slope was observed in 
finerenone-treated subjects compared to those on placebo. When mean values of eGFR between the 
treatment arms are compared, eGFR is numerically lower in the finerenone arm up until  two years 
after treatment initiation.  After this timepoint,  eGFR values were numerically higher in the finerenone 
arm. Analyses showed that  a more pronounced initial  decline was associated with  a better chronic 
preservation of renal function, indicating  that  the decline has no negative long-term consequences on 
eGFR.  
The data to support the second part of the initially  proposed indication “to reduce the risk of 
cardiovascular mortality and morbidity” were not  considered convincing. The risk reduction observed in 
the secondary endpoint ([HR 0.860;  95%  CI 0.747;  0.989])  was statistically significant but  not 
considered compelling, as required for applications based on one pivotal study  (Points to consider on 
application with  1. Meta-analyses; 2.  One pivotal study [CPMP/EWP/2330/99]).  The upper limit of the 
95% CI is close to unity  and the p-value (0.0339)  relatively close to  the assigned alpha level. 
Furthermore, none of the components of the composite were significantly changed when tested 
individually. The CHMP considered that  an assessment of the  final results of the FIGARO-DKD study is 
required before a conclusion could be reached with  respect to a CV indication, in line with  previous 
scientific advice. The applicant agreed to remove the cardiovascular part of the indication from the 
wording of the final, approved indication.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In FIDELIO-DKD study, 2,827  were treated with  finerenone for a total exposure of 6,346 patient-years, 
with  2,446 subjects (87%)  for at least 52 weeks, 1,632 subjects (58%)  for at least 2 years. Mean and 
median duration of treatment  in the safety analysis set (SAF) were similar in  both treatment arms 
(about 27 months). 
The number of TEAEs was balanced for finerenone (87.3%)  and placebo (87.5%);  however, the 
incidence of drug-related TEAEs was increased for finerenone (22.9%) compared with  placebo 
(15.9%).  The most commonly reported TEAEs that were reported more frequently for finerenone than 
for placebo were hyperkalaemia (18.3% vs 9.0%),  decreased GFR (6.3%  vs 4.7%),  anaemia (7.4%  vs 
6.7%),  hypotension (4.5%  vs 3.1%)  and hyponatremia (1.3%  vs 0.6%). 
The incidence of TESAEs was slightly higher in the  placebo group (34.3%)  than  in the finerenone group 
(31.9%)  and drug-related TESAEs slightly higher for finerenone (1.7%)  than for placebo (1.2%).  The 
most frequently reported TESAEs for finerenone versus placebo were pneumonia (2.5%  vs 3.6%), 
acute kidney injury (2.0% vs 1.8%) and hyperkalaemia (1.5% vs 0.4%).  There were more treatment 
emergent fatal cases in the  placebo group compared with the finerenone group (4.8%  vs 3.1%).

EMA/78746/2022

Discontinuation rate due to TEAE was higher for finerenone (7.3%)  than for placebo (5.9%) in  the 
FIDELIO-DKD study. The most frequently reported TEAE leading to study drug discontinuation  for 
finerenone vs placebo was hyperkalaemia (2.3% vs 0.9%). 
The incidence of hyperkalaemia was 2 times increased for finerenone versus placebo (18.3%  vs 9.0%). 
TESAEs of hyperkalaemia were reported more frequently for finerenone (1.6%)  than for placebo 
(0.4%).  A higher incidence of hyperkalaemia leading to discontinuation  (2.3%  vs 0.9%)  and 
hospitalisation (1.4%  vs 0.3%)  was reported for finerenone compared with placebo. More subjects 
treated with  finerenone, compared with placebo, reported one AE (11.9%  vs 6.6%), two  AEs (4.3%  vs 
1.8%)  and three AEs (1.5% vs 0.5%) of hypokalaemia, respectively. A higher incidence for finerenone, 
than for placebo, had changes in  serum potassium to >5.5  mmol/L (21.4% vs 9.2%)  and to  >6.0 
mmol/L (4.5%  vs 1.4%),  respectively, at any time during treatment.   
Hyponatremia, although less frequent than  hyperkalaemia, was more frequent for finerenone (1.3%) 
than for placebo (0.6%).   
The incidence of ‘eGFR decreased’ was increased for finerenone (6.3%)  compared with  placebo 
(4.7%).  The incidence of AEs from the SOC Renal and urinary disorders (18.5%  vs 19.5%)  was slightly 
higher for placebo, of which  the incidence of acute kidney injury (4.6% vs 4.8%) was balanced. 
However, the  incidence of drug-related events of ‘eGFR decreased’ (1.4% vs 0.5%) and AEs from the 
SOC Renal and urinary disorders (3.0% vs 2.3%),  including acute kidney injury (1.2% vs 0.6%), was 
increased for finerenone versus placebo. SAEs of events from the SOC Renal and urinary disorders 
(4.7%  vs 5.1%),  including acute kidney injury (2.0% vs 1.8%) was balanced. The incidence of serious 
events of eGFR decreased was low but  numerically higher for finerenone (0.2%)  than for placebo 
(0.1%). 
Hypotension occurred more frequently in subjects in the finerenone group (4.8%) than  in the placebo 
group (3.4%). Events associated with  hypotension such as dizziness (5.2%  vs 5.4%),  syncope (1.2% 
vs 2.0%)  and events of fall (1.6% vs 2.0%) were balanced between the groups.  
Anaemia was slightly increased for finerenone (7.4%) compared with  placebo (6.7%).  Serious 
anaemia, however, was low and balanced (0.5%  vs 0.7%).   
A decrease in mean haematocrit (<0.46%)  levels was observed in the first 4 months  in the finerenone 
arm compared to  placebo. 
In the first 12 months  of treatment,  the mean reduction in  SBP was approximately 2 to 4  mmHg 
greater in finerenone-treated subjects compared with  placebo, and the mean reduction in  DBP 
approximately 1 to 2 mmHg greater in the finerenone group compared to placebo. 
All-cause mortality was numerically reduced in the  finerenone arm (HR  0.946 [95%  CI 0.876;  1.022]; 
0.2348)  which supports that  there is no general detrimental  effect of finerenone on mortality.

The reporting rate was overall similar across the age groups. Slightly more SAEs were reported in the 
age group ≥75  years (35.0% vs 38.0%) compared to subjects 65-74  years (32.6% vs 32.7%) and 
<65 years (30.1%  vs 34.1%);  however, the incidence of SAEs was higher for placebo than  for 
finerenone in all age groups. More subjects discontinued due to an AE in  for finerenone compared with 
placebo in the  subgroups ≥75  years (9.5% vs 5.6%)  and 65-74 years (8.1%  vs 6.3%);  however, the 
discontinuation  rate due to AEs was balanced (5.7%  vs 5.6%)  in subjects <65  years. The incidence of

subjects discontinuing permanently due to  hyperkalaemia was increased for finerenone compared to 
placebo across age groups with  the highest incidence in the subgroup ≥75 years (3.9%  vs 0.7%). 
No notable differences between males and females, apart from that  the incidence of subjects that 
discontinued due to an AE was increased for finerenone compared with  placebo (8.0% vs 5.8%)  in 
males and was more balanced in  females (5.9% than 6.2%). 
The rate of AEs was similar between the treatment arms across the race groups; however, the 
incidence of AEs was about 85%-89%  in White, Black and Other subjects and was slightly  higher in 
Asian subjects (93%).  The difference was mainly driven by a higher number of subjects with  AEs of 
mild intensity  in the Asian race group (38%-41%)  compared to the  other race groups (19%-27%). 
The incidence of AEs and SAEs for finerenone versus placebo was similar in subjects with  eGFR 25 -
<45 mL/min/1.73m2  (AEs; 88.2%  vs SAEs; 88.9% and 31.8%  vs 35.3%)  and eGFR 45  - <60 
mL/min/1.73m2 (AEs; 86.8%  vs 86.2%  and SAEs; 32.6%  and 33.2%).  The risk of hyperkalaemia 
increased with decreasing renal function across eGFR strata: eGFR ≥60 (10.7% vs 8.6%), eGFR 45 -<60 
(14.7%  vs 6.3%)  and eGFR 25  -45 (22.1%  vs 10.6%). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The major safety concern is the  increased incidence of hyperkalaemia in the overall population. The 
risk of hyperkalaemia increased with decreasing renal function. Moreover, SAEs of hyperkalaemia were 
reported more frequently for finerenone than for placebo and a higher incidence of hyperkalaemia 
leading to discontinuation  and to  hospitalisation was reported for finerenone compared with placebo. 
The risk for serious events of hyperkalaemia could be handled with  routine risk minimisation. 
The incidence of ‘eGFR decreased’ was increased for finerenone compared with  placebo. The incidence 
of drug-related events of ‘eGFR decreased’ and drug-related renal AEs, including acute kidney injury, 
was increased for finerenone versus placebo. Information on decreased eGFR is included in section 4.8 
of the SmPC. There was an initial  decrease in eGFR in the finerenone group compared with  placebo 
group, across the subgroups eGFR >60,  45─≤60 and 25─≤45  mL/min/1.73  m2, with  a more 
pronounced magnitude in  eGFR decrease in the subgroups with higher baseline eGFR, i.e. eGFR >60 
and 45─≤60,  compared with the  eGFR 25─≤45  group.  
Finerenone is not recommended in subjects with  eGFR <25 mL/min/1.73m2  due to limited data. The 
posology was therefore updated to state that  treatment should be discontinued in patients  who have 
progressed to ESRD (eGFR <15 mL/min/1.73m2). 
The applicant has proposed and it  was agreed to include “hyperkalaemia” as an important  identified 
risk and “embryo-foetal toxicity” as an important potential risk.  “Use in pregnancy and lactation” has 
been proposed to  be included as missing information.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
CKD and T2D are each independently major global health concerns. An estimated 20 to  40% of T2D 
patients develop CKD, which is characterised by progressive damage and irreversible loss of function  in 
the kidney eventually leading to  kidney failure. 
For the treatment  of CKD and T2D, ACEis and ARBs constitute the  current standard of care. SGLT2-
inhibitors, initially  approved in 2013 for improving glycaemic control in T2D, have recently been shown 
to provide additional kidney and cardiovascular benefits in  patients with  CKD and T2D. Currently 
approved MR antagonists (e.g. spironolactone and eplerenone) are not  specifically indicated for 
treatment of patients with  CKD. The pathophysiology of CKD in T2D is multifactorial and there is a 
need for further effective therapies to  address the complex and numerous underlying disease 
mechanisms.  
The FIDELIO-DKD study encompassed 5674 patients with  CKD and T2D treated with  the maximum 
tolerated labelled dose of either an ACEi or ARB, or both. Other MR  antagonists were not permitted. 
The primary endpoint of the study refers to the claimed indication “treatment of chronic kidney 
disease”. Treatment with  finerenone resulted in a 17.5%  relative risk reduction compared with  placebo 
for the composite endpoint  of time to  first occurrence of kidney failure, a sustained decrease of eGFR 
≥40%  from baseline over at least 4 weeks, or renal death. The treatment  effect is considered clinically 
relevant, although  relatively modest. However, it should be noted that  the effect is obtained on top of 
current standard of care (ACEi or ARB).  
It is noted that  initiation  of finerenone treatment leads to an initial  decrease in eGFR and the values 
were numerically lower in the finerenone arm until  Month  24. When the long term eGFR slope (from 
Month  4 onwards) was assessed, a slower decline in eGFR over time with finerenone was however 
observed and the  applicant has also presented an analysis suggesting that  a more pronounced initial 
decline is associated with a better long term preservation of renal function which  indicates that  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/78746/2022

initial  decline has no negative long-term consequences on eGFR. The treatment effect is supported by 
the secondary renal composite endpoint that  defined a more pronounced eGFR decrease compared to 
the primary endpoint (≥57%  vs. ≥40%). Treatment with  finerenone resulted in a 23.7% relative risk 
reduction compared with  placebo. Further analyses of the primary and relevant secondary endpoints in 
the subgroup of patients with  CKD stage 3 and 4, i.e. the intended population,  showed consistent 
results. 
For the key secondary endpoint that  is of particular relevance for the initially proposed second part of 
the indication,  “to reduce the risk  of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity”, the  importance of the 
treatment effect is not convincing. Treatment with finerenone resulted in a 14% relative risk reduction 
compared with  placebo for the  CV composite endpoint time to CV death, non-fatal MI, non-fatal stroke, 
or hospitalisation for heart failure. The confidence interval is wide and the upper limit is approaching 
unity. Moreover, none of the components of the  composite displayed a pronounced positive effect. 
Thus, further data is considered necessary to support this  part of the  indication and the FIGARO-DKD 
trial with  a primary cardiovascular objective has recently been finished. The cardiovascular protection 
claim was removed from the initially proposed indication.   
The major safety concern is the  increased incidence of hyperkalaemia that increased with decreasing 
renal function. SAEs of hyperkalaemia were reported more frequently for finerenone than  for placebo 
and a higher incidence of hyperkalaemia leading to discontinuation and to hospitalisation  was reported 
for finerenone compared with placebo. The risk for serious events of hyperkalaemia could be handled 
with  routine risk minimisation. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Overall, the results from the FIDELIO-DKD study show positive effects of finerenone for the treatment 
of chronic kidney disease (stage 3 and 4 with  albuminuria) associated with  type 2 diabetes mellitus  in 
adults. Cardiovascular endpoints are in favour of finerenone, but  the treatment effect is not  convincing 
enough to support a cardiovascular prevention indication. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
The initially proposed therapeutic indication was: “Kerendia is indicated to  delay progression of kidney 
disease and to reduce the risk  of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in adults  with chronic kidney 
disease (stage 3 and 4 with  albuminuria) and type 2 diabetes”. 
At day 120,  the CHMP  proposed the following indication:  “Kerendia is indicated for the treatment  of 
diabetic kidney disease stage 3 and 4 in adults.” 
At day 180,  the applicant removed the cardiovascular prevention indication but  preferred a slightly 
different wording”: “Kerendia is indicated for the treatment of chronic kidney  disease (stage 3 and 4 
with  albuminuria) associated with  type 2  diabetes in adults.  For study results with  respect to renal and 
cardiovascular events, see section 5.1.” 
The applicant proposed to replace the term ‘diabetic kidney disease’ with  the term ‘chronic kidney 
disease associated with  type 2 diabetes’. This proposal was endorsed given that the  KDIGO 2020 
Clinical Practice Guideline for Diabetes Management in  Chronic Kidney Disease suggest not to use the 
term “diabetic kidney disease” to avoid the connotation that  CKD is caused by traditional diabetes 
pathophysiology in all cases, although  this term is entirely appropriate when this limitation  is 
recognised. Given that  the study included patients  based on specified UACR and eGFR criteria and a 
diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and excluded patients with  known significant nondiabetic renal disease but 
did not include a requirement of histological evidence of kidney disease caused by diabetes, the 
Assessment report  
EMA/78746/2022  
Page 157/159 
 
 
 
proposal ‘chronic kidney disease associated with  type 2 diabetes’ was considered appropriate. 
However, the  proposed reference to section 5.1 of the SmPC was not  considered appropriate and has 
been removed from the indication. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R balance of Kerendia is positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP  review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that  the benefit-risk balance of Kerendia is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Kerendia is indicated for the  treatment of chronic kidney disease (stage 3 and 4 with  albuminuria) 
associated with  type 2 diabetes in adults.

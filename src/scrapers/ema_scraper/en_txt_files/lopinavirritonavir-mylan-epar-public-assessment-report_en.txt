2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
HIV-1 infection is a life-threatening and serious disease of major public health significance, with 
approximately 35 million people living with HIV worldwide in 2012. This figure showed an increase from 
previous years as more people are receiving the life-saving antiretroviral therapy (UNAIDS, 2013). There's no 
cure for HIV/AIDS, but antiretroviral therapy can dramatically slow the progression of the disease and have 
reduced AIDS deaths in many developed nations. The world is within reach of providing antiretroviral therapy 
to 15 million people by 2015.  Standard of care for the treatment of HIV-1 infection uses combination 
antiretroviral therapy (ART) to suppress viral replication to below detectable limits, increase CD4 cell counts, 
and stop disease progression.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablet containing 100 mg of lopinavir and 25 mg of ritonavir 
or 200 mg of lopinavir and 50 mg of ritonavir as active substances.  
Other ingredients are: sorbitan laurate, silica, colloidal anhydrous, copovidone, sodium stearyl fumarate and 
for the film coating: hypromellose, titanium dioxide (E171), macrogol, hydroxypropyl cellulose, talc, silica, 
colloidal anhydrous, polysorbate 80. 
The product is available in HDPE bottle with white opaque polypropylene screw cap with aluminium induction 
sealing liner wad and desiccant and also in OPA/Al/PVC-aluminium blister as described in section 6.5 of the 
SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
Lopinavir 
The chemical name of lopinavir is (2S)-N-[(1S,3S,4S)-1-Benzyl-4-[[2-(2,6-dimethylphenoxy)acetyl]-amino]-
3-hydroxy-5-phenylpentyl]-3-methyl-2-[2-oxotetrahydropyrimidin-1(2H)-yl]butanamide and it has the 
following structure: 
Assessment report  
EMA/828552/2015 
Page 6/24 
 
  
  
The active substance is a white or yellowish-white, slightly hygroscopic powder, practically insoluble in water. 
Lopinavir exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of four chiral centres. Enantiomeric purity is 
controlled routinely by chiral HPLC and specific optical rotation. 
Polymorphism has been observed for active substance. Polymorphic form is controlled by the active 
substance manufacturing process. The manufacturing process of lopinavir involves crystallisation in ethanol 
and water. Based on the literature, other polymorphs require crystallisation from solvents in absence of 
water. Batch analysis data provided confirmed that the active substance manufacturer consistently produces 
the same form (Type-I higher hydrate form).   
Ritonavir 
The chemical name of ritonavir is thiazol-5-ylmethyl [(1S,2S,4S)-1-benzyl-2-hydroxy-4-[[(2S)-3-methyl-2-
[[methyl[[2-(1-methylethyl)thiazol-4-yl]methyl]carbamoyl]amino]butanoyl]amino]-5-
phenylpentyl]carbamate and it has the following structure: 
The active substance is a white or almost white powder, practically insoluble in water. 
Ritonavir exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of four chiral centres. Enantiomeric purity is 
controlled routinely by chiral HPLC. 
Polymorphism has been observed for active substance and is controlled by a XRD identification test in the 
active substance specifications. Batch analysis data provided confirmed that the active substance 
manufacturer consistently produces the same form (Form-I). 
As there are monographs of active substances in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturers of the 
lopinavir and ritonavir active substances have been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European 
Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for which has been provided within the current Marketing Authorisation Application.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
Specification 
The relevant information for both substances has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the respective 
Certificates of Suitability. 
Lopinavir 
The release specifications comply with the Ph. Eur. monograph and the CEP. Additional specifications 
mentioned in the CEP are for: residual solvents (GC), residual catalysts (ICP-OES), residual compound 2,6-
Dimethyl phenoxy acetyl chloride (HPLC).  
Ritonavir 
The release specifications comply with the Ph. Eur. monograph and the CEP. Additional specifications 
mentioned in the CEP are for:  residual solvents (GC) and polymorphic form identification (XRD). 
Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been 
presented for both active substances. 
Batch analysis data of three batches of each active substance are provided. The results are within the 
specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Lopinavir 
Stability data were provided for three production scale batches of the active substance from the proposed 
supplier stored in a container closure system representative of that intended for the market for 24 months 
under long term conditions at 30°C/65% RH and 6 months stability at 40°C/75%RH. 
The parameters tested are the same as for release except for residual solvents, residual catalysts, residual 
compound 2,6-Dimethyl phenoxy acetyl chloride. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications. The stability results indicate that the active substance 
manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently stable. The retest period of 36 months when “stored in 
an air-tight container” proposed by the API supplier is considered acceptable. The retest period followed by 
the finished product manufacturer is 12 months and is considered satisfactory as well. 
Ritonavir 
The CEP mentions a re-test period of 36 months for the active substance stored under nitrogen in a double 
polyethylene bag (outer black) in a triple laminated aluminium bag placed in polyethylene drum. The retest 
period followed by the finished product manufacturer is 12 months, even though more than 12 months is 
proposed by the drug substance manufacturer.

2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The composition of the finished product is provided. 
The aim of the development was to produce a finished product equivalent to Kaletra film coated tablets. 
The excipients used are the same as for the reference medicinal product except for the colorant of the film 
coating. They are well known pharmaceutical ingredients whose quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. 
The colorants used in Opadry coating material comply with EU regulation 231/2012. There are no novel 
excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the 
SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. Results of active substance/excipients compatibility studies were 
provided and demonstrated that all the excipients chosen were compatible with the two active substances. 
Studies results were also provided to justify excipients quantities and grades used.  
Lopinavir and ritonavir are water insoluble active substances. When administered as tablet prepared by 
conventional techniques, the oral bioavailability of these drugs is negligible. In order to have clinically 
significant concentrations of these drugs, the reference product Kaletra film coated tablets has been made 
using melt extrusion technique in which both the drugs are present in the form of solid dispersion. Therefore 
to make a generic bioequivalent product, it was decided to prepare a solid dispersion by melt extrusion where 
both the substances are present in amorphous form. 
The formulation used during bioequivalence studies is the same that the used for marketing.  
Bioequivalence study was performed showing bioequivalence between the 200/50 mg strength tablets of the 
test and reference product.  
A request for a biowaiver for the other strength 100 mg/25 mg was proposed on the basis that: both 
strengths are manufactured by the same manufacturer using the same manufacturing process, the 
qualitative composition of the different strengths is the same, the composition of the strengths are 
quantitatively proportional, lopinavir and ritonavir exhibits linear pharmacokinetics in the proposed dose 
range, and the similarity of the dissolution profiles of the different strengths. The biowaiver request was 
considered acceptable. 
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. 
The proposed 100 mg/25 mg tablet is similar and comparable to the reference product tablets as far as shape 
and size is concerned. Therefore acceptability of the 100 mg/25 mg tablet formulation by paediatric patient 
population should be similar to the reference product acceptability. Before prescribing Lopinavir/ Ritonavir 
100 mg/25 mg tablets, infants and young children should be assessed for the ability to swallow intact tablets. 
The following statement is mentioned in section 4.2 of the SmPC “Before prescribing lopinavir/ritonavir 
100/25 mg tablets, infants and young children should be assessed for the ability to swallow intact tablets. For 
infants and young children unable to swallow tablets, more suitable formulations containing 
lopinavir/ritonavir should be checked for their availability”. 
The primary packaging is OPA/Al/PVC-aluminium blister pack or HDPE bottle with white opaque 
polypropylene screw cap with aluminium induction sealing liner wad and desiccant. The material complies 
with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability 
data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Assessment report  
EMA/828552/2015 
Page 9/24 
 
  
  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of nine main steps: sifting, mixing, hot melt extrusion, milling and 
sifting, blending, compression, film coating, inspection, packaging. The process is considered to be a 
standard manufacturing process based on applicant and manufacturing site experience with hot melt 
extrusion (HME) technique. This was considered acceptable. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated on three pilot batches of each strength. 
Holding times were validated. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of 
producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are 
adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. The applicant has committed to 
perform process validation studies on the first three production-scale batches of lopinavir and ritonavir 
100 mg/25 mg and 200 mg/50 mg film coated tablets according to the process validation protocol provided. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: description, 
identification (HPLC, thin-layer chromatography), colour identification for titanium dioxide , dissolution (HPLC, 
Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), water (By KF), 
microbiological test (Ph. Eur.).  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three pilot scale batches of each strength confirming the consistency 
of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data were provided for 3 pilot scale batches of each strength of finished product stored under long 
term conditions for 12 months at 25°C/60% RH and for 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40°C/75% 
RH according to the ICH guidelines. The batches of medicinal product are representative to those proposed 
for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested according to shelf life specifications described in the section above. The analytical 
procedures used are stability indicating. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New 
Drug Substances and Products. The results demonstrated that lopinavir and ritonavir film coated tablets are 
not photosensitive. 
Stability of bulk tablets in the packaging simulating the packaging proposed for transfer of the finished 
product to the approved Europe repackaging site is also studied for 12 months under long term conditions 
25°C/60% RH and 6 months under accelerated conditions 40°C/75% RH. Results demonstrate stability of 
bulk tablets for 12 months without any special storage precaution. 
In-use stability studies are also performed on two batches of the 200 mg/50 mg strength packaged in HDPE 
bottle. Every pack was opened every day for about 2 min and the condition of the patient withdrawing one 
Assessment report  
EMA/828552/2015 
Page 10/24 
 
  
  
tablet shall be simulated by tilting the bottle. Then the bottles are tightly closed. The procedure continued 
until 120th day was reached. Results demonstrate stability for 120 days after opening. The need for an in-use 
shelf-life of 120 days was considered justified. The justification for choosing only the higher strength for 
performing the in-use stability study was considered acceptable. 
The results demonstrate compliance to shelf-life specification. Based on available stability data, the proposed 
shelf-life of 24 months without any storage conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable as 
well as the 120 days shelf-life after opening (section 6.3). 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablet containing 100 mg of lopinavir and 25 mg of ritonavir 
or 200 mg of lopinavir and 50 mg of ritonavir as active substances. Information on development, 
manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been presented in a satisfactory 
manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
None.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology  
Both lopinavir and ritonavir are peptidomimetic inhibitors of the HIV-1 and HIV-2 proteases (Kaletra SmPC 
2014, Norvir SmPC 2014). Protease inhibitors (PIs) prevent the formation of mature virions by blocking the 
processing of viral Gag-Pol proteins in infected cells (Safrin 2012). Gag and Gag-Pol gene products are 
translated into precursor proteins as HIV virions mature. These proteins are post-translationally processed by 
HIV protease to become structural elements of the core of future viral particles (Menéndez-Arias 2002). 
Protease inhibitors prevent the cleavage of the Gag-Pol polyprotein resulting in the production of immature, 
noninfectious viral particles. This action effectively terminates the propagation of infection. 
Lopinavir has about 10-fold greater potency than ritonavir as a PI (Sham 1998, SBOA 2000), however it has 
Assessment report  
EMA/828552/2015 
Page 11/24 
 
  
  
poor oral bioavailability. Ritonavir, in addition to its PI activity, is a potent inhibitor of CYP3A-mediated 
lopinavir metabolism and is thus co-administered with lopinavir as a pharmacokinetic enhancer. Given 
together these compounds produce sustained suppression of HIV replication. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of ritonavir, lopinavir and the combined administration of these compounds have been 
extensively evaluated in a variety of animal models. As the current submission is for a fixed dose 
combination of lopinavir/ritonavir, the non-clinical pharmacokinetics of concomitant lopinavir/ritonavir dosing 
is the primary focus of this section of the summary. Due to the extent of data available, these sections are 
presented in summary form, highlighting the principle findings from the development of these compounds as 
reviewed in US FDA regulatory documents (Summary Basis of Approval documents; SBOA 1995, SBOA 
2000). Data from other sources were noted. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
The systemic toxicity of lopinavir and/or ritonavir has been evaluated in a variety of species, principally 
subsequent to oral administration (intravenous acute toxicity also evaluated for ritonavir and 
lopinavir/ritonavir). In acute toxicity studies, both compounds (and their combination) demonstrated a low 
potential for acute oral toxicity. In repeat dose toxicity studies, the liver appeared to be the primary organ of 
toxicity with effects being noted across species (mouse, rat and dog). The mutagenic and clastogenic 
potential of both compounds (individually and combined) has been evaluated in vitro and in vivo with 
negative results being obtained in all assays. Carcinogenicity studies with ritonavir and lopinavir/ritonavir 
were performed in mice and rats and occurrences of hepatic carcinomas/adenomas were noted, though these 
were considered to be of non-genotoxic origin and not relevant to human exposure. In developmental and 
reproductive studies, foetal effects were associated with maternally toxic doses of ritonavir or the 
lopinavir/ritonavir combination. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of 
Lopinavir and Ritonavir - 100 mg/25 mg and 200 mg/50 mg - film-coated tablets manufactured by Mylan 
SAS is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all 
lopinavir/ritonavir containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, 
the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of 
Lopinavir and Ritonavir -100 mg/25 mg and 200 mg/50 mg - film-coated tablets manufactured by Mylan SAS 
is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all 
Lopinavir/Ritonavir containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, 
the ERA is expected to be similar and not increased.

2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided. The 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data as well known for lopinavir and ritonavir and thus new 
non-clinical data are not required.  The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the 
reference product.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
Exemption 
Mylan  is  applying  for  a  marketing  authorisation  for  2  different  strengths  of  Lopinavir/Ritonavir  film  coated 
tablets (200 mg/50 mg and 100 mg/25 mg). 
The bio-equivalence study was performed on Lopinavir and Ritonavir 200 mg/50 mg film coated tablets and 
the applicant states that the results can be extended to the lower strengths based on the following facts: 
  Both the strengths of Lopinavir and ritonavir 100 mg/25 mg and 200 mg/50 mg film coated tablets 
are manufactured by the same manufacturer at the same manufacturing site using similar 
manufacturing process. 
 
The excipients included in the composition of the formulation are well established and no interaction 
with the pharmacokinetics of the active substance is expected. 
 
The qualitative composition of both the strengths is the same. Lopinavir and ritonavir 100 mg/25 mg 
and 200 mg/50 mg film-coated tablets are direct scale up/scale down formulations. 
 
Pharmacokinetics of both drugs i.e. Lopinavir and Ritonavir is linear over the dosage range. 
  Both the strengths exhibit similar in-vitro performance. So the dissolution profiles can be considered 
similar. 
In order to accept the biowaiver request, the applicant had to discuss dose linearity over the dose range 
applied for (100/25 - 200/50 mg), and clarify the issues raised regarding the evaluation of comparative 
dissolution studies based on similarity factor.   
Linear pharmacokinetics of Lopinavir and Ritonavir: 
The administration of 200 mg/50 mg of Lopinavir and Ritonavir film-coated tablets twice daily showed a 
Lopinavir AUC0–12 that was 55% lower than that achieved by the standard 400/100 mg twice daily dose 
(90% CI 0.40–0.51). The Lopinavir Cmax and Ctrough were also significantly lower (46% and 70%, 
respectively).  
Ritonavir pharmacokinetic parameters were lower for the 200 mg/50 mg Lopinavir and Ritonavir film-coated 
tablets twice daily dose versus the other two doses (400/100 mg and 200/150 mg; twice daily) evaluated. 
Further as per the guideline , for the drugs which meet the above clauses and display linear 
pharmacokinetics, the bioequivalence study should in general be conducted at the highest strength.  
Thus study is conducted on 200 mg/50 mg strength Lopinavir and Ritonavir film-coated tablets available in 
market of submission and the remaining strength (100 mg/25 mg Lopinavir and Ritonavir film-coated tablets) 
was applied for Biowaiver.

2.4.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The applicant has submitted one bioequivalence study in support of this application. 
Methods 
This was a randomised, open-label, balanced, two-period, two-sequence, two treatment, single dose, 
crossover comparative oral bioavailability study to establish comparative bioequivalence of  
Lopinavir/Ritonavir  200 mg/50 mg film coated tablets (Mylan Laboratories Limited Nashik India) and Kaletra 
200 mg/50 mg film coated tablets (MAH: Abbvie Ltd) in 72 healthy, adult, human subjects under fasting 
conditions. The objective of the study was to compare the rate and extent of absorption of both products and 
to monitor the adverse events to ensure the safety and tolerability of a single dose of Lopinavir/Ritonavir 
200 mg/50 mg.  
Study design  
Based on the randomised schedule and following an overnight fast of at least 10 hours in both periods each 
volunteer received a single oral dose of Lopinavir/Ritonavir 200/50 mg film coated tablet (either one tablet of 
the reference or test product) with 240 ml of water during period I and period II.  
Subjects were dosed while in sitting posture and were instructed to remain seated in an upright position for 
the first 4 hours following drug administration. Drinking water was not permitted one hour before dosing and 
until one hour post dose. Subjects were confined to the clinical facility from a time adequate to ensure 
10 hours fasting until after the 24 hours post dose blood sample collection in each study period. 
The two periods were separated by a wash-out phase of at least 8 days.  
Blood samples were taken at the following time points: The pre-dose blood sample of 6.0 mL was collected 
within one hour prior to the dosing. The post-dose blood samples of 6.0 mL each was drawn at 0.50, 1.00, 
1.50, 2.00, 2.50, 3.00, 3.50, 4.00, 4.50, 5.00, 5.50, 6.00, 6.50, 7.00, 8.00, 9.00, 10.00, 12.00, 16.00, 
24.00 and 36.00 hours following drug administration in each period. Adverse events and vital signs have 
been monitored at the specified time-points during the study. Blood sampling time adjustments are 
presented in the dossier.

Analytical methods   
Analysis of Lopinavir/Ritonavir was performed using test method AMP-137-01. 
This HPLC/MS/MS method involved the estimation of Lopinavir, Ritonavir from human plasma using internal 
standards Lopinavir D8, Ritonavir D6. 3168 blood samples were to be collected for the 72 subjects however 
3132 samples were received since one subject dropped out (36 missing samples were all accounted for the 
study). 40 samples were re-assayed for Lopinavir and 19 samples were re-assayed for Ritonavir. The reasons 
for their reanalysis were documented and presented. 
Validation of the test method 
The method has been validated (MV-07-001-LPVRTV-00) and partially revalidated 2 times. The following 
parameters were addressed; selectivity of Lopinavir/Ritonavir and the internal standard (IS), calibration 
curve (linearity), specificity, recovery of both the analyte and the internal standard, precision, accuracy, 
dilution integrity accuracy and precision, stability of the stock solution (short and long term stability in the 
biological matrix, bench top, dry extract, coolant, freeze-thaw, in-injector stability), and matrix effect. Each 
parameter has been assessed and the limits are justified. This is deemed acceptable.  
Partial validation was carried out twice, first due to a change in the internal standard for Lopinavir and 
ritonavir; second to prove instrument ruggedness after change of internal standard for Lopinavir and 
ritonavir. 
Calibration curve range for the partial validation:  
1st partial validation: Lopinavir 99.942 ng/ml to 7995.382 ng/ml, Ritonavir: 10.149-811.899 ng/ml 
2nd partial validation: Lopinavir 100.007 ng/ml to 8000.520 ng/ml, Ritonavir: 10.001-800.051 ng/ml 
The effect of interfering drugs was also studied using the following used medicines in the study due to the 
adverse effects: Dicyclomine hydrochloride and paracetamol. No effect on the determination of the analyte 
and the internal standard was observed.  
Bioanalytical report 
The bioanalytical report was submitted with 20% of the subject chromatograms presented as well as the 
method SOP. Lopinavir D8 and Ritonavir D6 were used as internal standards (IS) and were sourced from 
Assessment report

Clearsynth. A certificate of analysis for the reference standards of Lopinavir, Ritonavir, Lopinavir D8 and 
Ritonavir D6 has been provided and are deemed acceptable.  
For the actual study the calibration curve range was Lopinavir 100.016 ng/ml to 8001.286 ng/ml, Ritonavir: 
10.001 – 500.032 ng/ml 
Lopinavir: Inter batch accuracy 93.35-103.72%, precision: 2.43-2.87% 
Ritonavir: Inter batch accuracy 96.40-99.99%, precision 4.64-5.01% 
Incurred Sample Reanalysis 
208 samples were identified for incurred sample reanalysis. 99.04% (Lopinavir) and 93.75% (Ritonavir) is 
the percentage of samples where the difference between the two values was less than 20% of the mean for 
chromatographic assays or less than 30% for the ligand binding assays.  
Pharmacokinetic variables 
Primary parameters:  AUC0-t and Cmax  
Secondary parameters: Kel, t1/2, AUC_%Extrap_obs, AUC0-∞, Tmax. 
Bioequivalence criteria:  
Based on the statistical results of 90% confidence interval of the geometric least square mean ratio for the 
pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax and AUC0-t of Lopinavir and Ritonavir then conclusions were drawn whether 
test formulation is bioequivalent to reference formulation under fasting condition. Acceptance range for 
bioequivalence is 80.00%-125.00% for 90% confidence intervals of the geometric least square means ratio 
for Cmax and AUC0-t of Lopinavir and Ritonavir. 
Statistical methods 
Statistical tests like ANOVA, least square means for test and reference formulations, difference between test 
and reference formulations, intra-subject variability and power were calculated for ln-transformed 
pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞. Geometric least square means of test and reference 
formulations, its ratio, 90% confidence interval for geometric least square mean ratio and Two One-Sided 
Tests for 90% confidence interval limits were calculated for pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and 
AUC0-∞ of Lopinavir and Ritonavir.

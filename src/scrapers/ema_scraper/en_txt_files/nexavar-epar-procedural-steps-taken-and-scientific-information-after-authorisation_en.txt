MAH, the product information has been revised to include 
Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to delete the 
warning on limited experience with the use of 
Nexavar in elderly, and update of section 4.8 of the 
SmPC to add hypokalaemia, proteinuria and 
nephrotic syndrome as new adverse reactions and 
include updated information on interstitial lung like 
events based on the results of a safety review. The 
Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. Furthermore, 
Annex II is being brought in line with the latest QRD 
template version 8.3.

(frequency common), proteinuria (frequency common) and 
nephrotic syndrome (frequency rare). Regarding 
hypokalaemia, decreased potassium was observed in 5.4% 
and 9.5% of Nexavar-treated patients compared to 0.7% 
and 5.9% of placebo patients, in two studies respectively. 
Most reports of hypokalaemia were low grade (CTCAE 
Grade 1). In these studies CTCAE Grade 3 hypokalaemia 
occurred in 1.1% and 0.4% of Nexavar treated patients 
and 0.2% and 0.7% of patients in the placebo group. There 
were no reports of hypokalaemia CTCAE grade 4. In 
addition, a cumulative review on fatal interstitial lung

disease (ILD) identified 11 cases for which the causality to 
sorafenib was at least possible. Hence, the product 
information has been updated to reflect that ILD adverse 
reactions may have a life-threatening or fatal outcome and 
that such events are either uncommon or less frequent 
than uncommon. Cumulative safety data also showed that 
there were no differences of clinical relevance in the safety 
profile of elderly versus non-elderly patients treated with 
sorafenib and therefore the warning that there is limited 
experience with the use of Nexavar in elderly in was 
deleted from the SmPC.

emergent Adverse Events of hypocalcaemia and 
hypocalcaemia from laboratory measurements was higher

in Eudra Vigilance there were 11 cases "leucocytoclastic 
vasculitis" in total, although only 7 were valid after 
excluding three cases with insufficient information and one 
duplicated case. Based on these cases including two 
positive dechallenges and a PRR 2.56 (95%CI: 1.28 - 5.13) 
the term "leucocytoclastic vasculitis" has been added to 
SmPC section 4.8 and PL section 4 with the frequency 
"rare". 
The MAH performed a cumulative search for cases 
potentially consistent with rhabdomyolysis; this search 
identified a total of 391 cases. Rhabdomyolysis was 
reported in 12 cases and 11 were medically confirmed. 
Statins were used as a concomitant medication in 2 
patients and glycyrrhizic acid were used in additional 2 
cases. The CHMP considered with the assessment of PSUR 
8 that two cases with rhabdomyolysis during sorafenib 
treatment experienced a positive rechallenge. A positive 
rechallenge is generally regarded as strong indication for 
causality. Further it was noted that symptoms from 
muscles were commonly expressed by patients treated with 
sorafenib indicating a muscle impact by sorafenib. 
Therefore, the term "rhabdomyolysis" has been added to 
SmPC section 4.8 and PL section 4 with the frequency 
"rare".

This was an application for a group of variations. The 
respective scope of the variations was to update 
SmPC section 4.5 with information on the interaction 
between sorafenib and cyclophosphamide as well as 
to update SmPC section 4.8 re-including the term 
"radiation pneumonitis" as clarification of the 
uncommon adverse reaction "interstitial lung 
disease-like events". These changes follow the 
recommendation provided with the CHMP 
assessment of the Periodic Safety Update Report 
(PSUR) 7. In addition, the MAH proposed to remove 
"carboplatin" from section 2 of the PL as the term 
was erroneously included in this section of the PL 
during the previous variation II/18G, although no 
pharmacokinetic interaction between carboplatin and 
sorafenib was demonstrated.  
Furthermore, an update of SmPC sections 4.4, 4.8 
and 5.1 regarding QT prolongation; to include a 
warning on QT prolongation in section 4.4, a rare 
adverse reaction in section 4.8, and information 
about the underlying Clinical Pharmacology Study in 
section 5.1 has been performed. The PL has been 
updated accordingly. 
sorafenib on cyclophosphamide, a CYP2B6 substrate, in 
vivo. In this study, concomitant administration of sorafenib 
with cyclophosphamide resulted in a small decrease in 
cyclophosphamide exposure, but no decrease in the 
systemic exposure of 4-OH cyclophosphamide, the active 
metabolite of cyclophosphamide that is formed primarily by 
CYP2B6. 
Sorafenib inhibited CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 in vitro 
with similar potency. However, in clinical pharmacokinetic 
studies, concomitant administration of sorafenib 400 mg 
twice daily with cyclophosphamide, a CYP2B6 substrate, or 
paclitaxel, a CYP2C8 substrate, did not result in a clinical 
meaningful inhibition. These data suggest that sorafenib at 
the recommended dose of 400 mg twice daily may not be 
an in vivo inhibitor of CYP2B6 or CYP2C8. Additionally, 
concomitant treatment with sorafenib and warfarin, a 
CYP2C9 substrate, did not result in changes in mean PT-
INR compared to placebo. Thus, also the risk for a clinically 
relevant in vivo inhibition of CYP2C9 by sorafenib may be 
expected to be low. However, patients taking warfarin or 
phenprocoumon should have their INR checked regularly. 
A single arm clinical trial of 400 mg bid sorafenib in male 
patients with cancer specifically designed to evaluate 
cardiovascular safety. In this clinical pharmacology study, 
QT/QTc measurements were recorded in 31 patients at

failure has used the Global Integrated Analysis dataset 
consisting only of data from the MAH sponsored Phase 1 to 
Phase 3 sorafenib monotherapy clinical studies. In these 
company sponsored clinical trials congestive heart failure 
was reported as an adverse event in 1.9% of patients 
treated with sorafenib. Based on the review of the 
submitted documentation the CHMP considered that there 
is a likely increase in patients experiencing congestive 
heart failure. Therefore, upgrading the frequency category 
to "common" for the term "congestive heart failure" was 
supported. Furthermore, additional information related to 
congestive heart failure was added to SPC section 4.8. 
The potential association of sorafenib with an increase in

the reporting rate for "interstitial lung disease" was 
evaluated by the MAH. Of the 57 cases identified by the 
search, there was in 16 cases information presented within 
the case for the candidate event that suggested a clear 
alternative cause, but that a potential role of sorafenib 
could not be ruled out. In 7 cases, the MAH considered that 
available information was consistent with a diagnosis of 
potentially drug-induced ILD. Therefore, the term 
"interstitial lung disease-like events" has been added to 
SPC section 4.8.

address the concern that the action of antibiotics in the 
gastrointestinal tract could interfere with the enterohepatic 
recycling of sorafenib. Sorafenib is metabolised in part by 
glucuronidation. The glucuronide conjugate of sorafenib is 
secreted into the gastrointestinal tract via the bile. Some 
microbes of the gastrointestinal flora release 
glucuronidases which can cleave the sorafenib conjugate, 
thereby releasing free drug that can be reabsorbed. The 
hypothesis to be tested in Study 12348 was whether partial 
or complete eradication of the gastrointestinal flora could 
diminish the extent of sorafenib re-absorption, thereby 
decreasing the systemic exposure of sorafenib. 
Study 12348 was an open-label, randomised, two-period 
sequential treatment study conducted in 28 healthy male 
volunteers. Neomycin was chosen as the test antibiotic 
because of published reports that it effectively reduced 
glucuronidase activity.  
Neomycin was shown to decrease sorafenib Area Under the 
Curve (AUC) by 54%, probably due to eradication of 
gastrointestinal bacterial glucorinidase activity, and thereby 
a decrease in the enterohepatic recycling of sorafenib. It 
cannot be excluded that other antibiotics that affect the 
gastrointestinal flora might have a similar effect on 
sorafenib. Therefore, a warning in SPC section 4.4 
regarding co-administration of neomycin or other 
antibiotics that cause major ecological disturbances of the 
gastrointestinal microflora may lead to a decrease in 
sorafenib bioavailability has been included. The risk of 
reduced plasma concentrations of sorafenib should be 
considered before starting a treatment course with 
antibiotics. Furthermore, additional information has been

added to SPC sections 4.5 and 5.2. 
In addition, the ADRs 'hyperthyroidism' and 'Steven-

uncommon event and the ADR 'erythema multiforme minor' 
was changed to 'erythema multiforme'.

the SPC to include the results of the Asian hepatocellular 
carcinoma study 11849 (Study 4), upon request by the 
CHMP following the assessment of the Follow-Up Measure 
FU2 021.1. 
Study 11849 (Study 4) was a Phase III, international, 
multi-centre, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled 
study that evaluated the clinical benefit of sorafenib 400 
mg (2 x 200 mg tablets) twice daily (bid) versus placebo, 
both added to Best Supportive Care, in 226 patients with 
advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (Child-Pugh A only). 
This study, conducted in China, Korea and Taiwan 
confirmed the findings of the pivotal study (Study 3) with 
respect to the favourable benefit-risk profile of Nexavar 
(HR (OS): 0.68, p = 0.01414).

In the prespecified stratification factors (ECOG status,

information in sections 4.4 and 4.5 on the potential risk of 
decreased sorafenib exposure when administered 
concomitantly with substances that increase gastric pH. 
The MAH has provided data from a 3-way, single-dose 
crossover study in healthy male volunteers, evaluating the 
effect of food (moderate-fat meal) and the effect of 
concomitant omeprazole treatment on the bioavailability of 
sorafenib (the fed study arm was included to serve as a 
comparison of pH-related effects beyond those attributable 
to food). It was shown that daily treatment with a 40 mg 
omeprazole led to a mean increase in gastric pH from 1 to 
4, but had no effect on sorafenib bioavailability. It was 
therefore concluded that anti-acidic treatment would not be 
expected to have a clinically meaningful effect on sorafenib 
exposure. 
In addition, the MAH applied to add a recommendation for 
monitoring of fluid balance and electrolytes in patients at 
risk of renal dysfunction in section 4.2 and to add the ADR 
"renal failure" to section 4.8 of the SPC. The MAH has 
provided a review of sorafenib data relevant to 'renal 
dysfunction'. Based on this analysis it is considered that 
there is little evidence to support a primary nephrotoxic

potential of sorafenib. However, due to the possible indirect 
action through the induction of diarrhoea, vomiting, 
dehydration with subsequent possible volume depletion and 
hypotension, that is associated with sorafenib, it is 
considered that sorafenib may have the potential to 
contribute to the development of renal dysfunction through 
pre-renal mechanisms.

Based on individual case reports and rather circumstantial

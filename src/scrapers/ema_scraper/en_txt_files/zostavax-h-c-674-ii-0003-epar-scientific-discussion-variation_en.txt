SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION  
3.1. 
Introduction 
ZOSTAVAX is a live attenuated vaccine containing Varicella-zoster virus1, Oka/Merck strain, (live, 
attenuated,  not  less  than  19400  Plaque-Forming  Units  (PFU)).  ZOSTAVAX  was  developed  for 
prevention  of  herpes  zoster  (HZ)  and  herpes  zoster-related  post  herpetic  neuralgia  in  individuals  60 
years and older as a single-dose vaccine.  
The Marketing Authorisation of ZOSTAVAX was granted in May 2006; however the product has not 
been launched in any Member State of the European Union yet. 
A manufacturing change for ZOSTAVAX from a frozen to a refrigerator-stable formulation (Variation 
EMEA/H/C/000674/II/0002) was adopted by the CHMP in November 2006.  
The  currently  authorised  “refrigerated  formulation”  of  ZOSTAVAX  is  a  sterile  lyophilised  product 
prepared  by  formulating  the  attenuated  Oka/Merck  VZV  strain  propagated  in  MRC-5  cell  culture. 
Sterile diluent is provided for reconstitution. As before, the vaccine is formulated to contain 19,400 or 
more plaque-forming units (PFU) of VZV per dose at expiry. 
The modification sought in this variation was to expand the indication of ZOSTAVAX to individuals 
≥ 50 years of age for the prevention of HZ and its complications. 
Despite the availability of antiviral agents to treat HZ and a variety of medications and other therapies 
to help control the associated pain, HZ and its complications represent a large  and growing medical 
problem among adults 50 years of age or older.  
The MAH estimated that routine vaccination beginning at 50 years of age could increase by at least 
50%  the number  of  HZ  cases  that  could  be prevented  each year,  compared  with  routine vaccination 
beginning at 60 years of age. Preventing these cases would also prevent the corresponding burden of 
HZ complications, including PHN. 
3.2.  Clinical efficacy 
The  efficacy  of  ZOSTAVAX  was  previously  demonstrated  in  Protocol  004  (“Shingles  Prevention 
Study”, “SPS”), a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre efficacy study in adults ≥ 
60 years of age. Protocol 004 was included as pivotal study in the initial application for the Marketing 
Authorisation. The data from this study demonstrated that compared with placebo, ZOSTAVAX was 
significantly efficacious in preventing HZ and HZ-associated pain, including PHN. 
Protocol  010  evaluated  in  this  variation  procedure  was  a  randomised,  controlled,  double-blind, 
multicentre study to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the refrigerated formulation 
zoster vaccine compared with the frozen formulation.  
Protocol  011  evaluated  in  this  variation  procedure  was  a  randomised,  controlled,  double-blind, 
multicentre study to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of ZOSTAVAX administered 
concomitantly versus sequentially with inactivated influenza vaccine. Administration of ZOSTAVAX 
and placebo was blinded, but all subjects received open-labelled influenza vaccine on day 1. 
Clinical studies 
In Protocol 010, a total of 367 HZ history-negative adults 50 years of age and older were stratified 1:2 
by age (50 to 59 years of age and ≥60 years of age, respectively) and were randomised in a 1:1 ratio on 
day 1 to receive one dose of either the refrigerated formulation zoster vaccine (44,846 PFU/0.65 ml) or 
the  frozen  formulation  zoster  vaccine  (56,845  PFU/0.65  ml).  Serum  samples  were  obtained  prior  to 
vaccination on day 1 and at week 4 post vaccination, and were tested for VZV antibody levels using 
glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (gpELISA). The VZV antibody response was also 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
measured  by  gpELISA  at  6  weeks  post  vaccination.  Other  assays  measuring  the  VZV-specific  cell-
mediated immune (CMI) - response elicited by vaccination have been used in other clinical studies in 
the development program  for ZOSTAVAX as well as the CMI Substudy of  the Shingles Prevention 
Study. Although these assays correlated somewhat with protection against HZ, the vaccine effect on 
the reduction of HZ incidence was best reflected by the measurement of the VZV antibody response 
by gpELISA (titer and fold rise from prevaccination). In the CMI Substudy of the Shingles Prevention 
Study, a regression analysis showed that the increase in gpELISA titres at 6 weeks post vaccination 
was associated with a significant reduction in the risk of developing HZ (p<0.001). 
In Protocol 011, a total of 763 HZ history-negative adults 50 years of age and older were stratified 1:2 
by age (50 to 59 years of age and ≥60 years of age, respectively) and were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to 
receive either ZOSTAVAX concomitantly with influenza vaccine on day 1 and placebo on week 4 or 
influenza  vaccine  with  placebo  on  day  1  and  ZOSTAVAX  at  week  4.  In  this  study  the  frozen 
formulation  of  ZOSTAVAX  was  administered  at  a  potency  of  58.331  PFU/0.65ml.  Approximately 
75 %  of  the  subjects  were  enrolled  in  the  United  States  and  25  %  of  the  subjects  were  enrolled  in 
Europe. The VZV antibody response was measured by gpELISA at 4 weeks post vaccination. Other 
assays  measuring  the  VZV-specific  CMI  response  elicited  by  vaccination  have  been  used  in  other 
clinical  studies  in  the  development  program  for  ZOSTAVAX,  as  well  as  the  CMI  Substudy  of  the 
Shingles Prevention Study. Although these assays correlated with protection against HZ, the vaccine 
effect  on  the reduction of HZ  incidence  in  the  CMI Substudy  of  the  Shingles Prevention  Study  was 
best reflected by the measurement of the VZV antibody response by gpELISA (titer and fold rise from 
prevaccination).  
Serum samples were obtained prior to vaccination on day 1, week 4 and at week 8 post vaccination, 
and were tested for VZV antibody levels using gpELISA.  
For  strain-specific  influenza  antibody  responses  by  haemagglutinin  inhibition  sera  were  obtained  at 
day 1  prior  vaccination  and  at  week  4,  which  were  tested  at  Focus  Diagnostics,  Inc.,  Cypress, 
California, USA. 
Initial  studies  of  ZOSTAVAX  also  measured  immune  responses  at  6  weeks  post  vaccination.  Since 
safety  follow-up  was  shortened  to  28  days  post  vaccination  in  Protocol  010  and  subsequent  studies, 
including  Protocol  011,  the  immunogenicity  sample  collection  was  combined  with  the  review  of 
Vaccine  Report  Card  (VRC)  in  a  single  post  vaccination  visit,  to  simplify  study  procedures  for  the 
subjects and study sites. In addition, the antibody responses to influenza were assessed at 28 days post 
vaccination by HAI as previously established in influenza vaccine studies. 
Methods 
Combined  analysis  of  studies  010  and  011  and  bridging  of  immunological  data  to  demonstrate 
efficacy  
The immunogenicity data presented in this application were derived from an integrated report, which 
analysed  combined  immunogenicity  data  from  two  clinical  studies,  Protocol  010  and  Protocol  011. 
These  data  were  presented  to  demonstrate  that  ZOSTAVAX  induces  a  VZV  antibody  response  in 
subjects  50  to  59  years  of  age  that  is  noninferior  to  that  in  subjects  ≥  60  years  of  age,  and  thereby 
provides  an  immunological  bridge  to  the  vaccine  efficacy  demonstrated  in  the  SPS  in  subjects 
≥ 60 years of age.  
In  the  integrated  report,  the  analyses  of  the  varicella-zoster  virus  (VZV)  antibody  responses  to 
ZOSTAVAX among subjects 50 to 59 years of age in comparison with those in subjects 60 years of age or 
older  were  presented.  The  immunogenicity  data  from  the  two  clinical  studies,  Protocol  010  (refrigerated 
formulation  bridging  study)  and  Protocol  011  (concomitant  use  study  with  influenza  vaccine)  was 
combined, as well as the safety data from those two studies in the two age groups. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Statistical hypotheses 
Success of the trials required satisfying two primary immunogenicity hypotheses: 
1.  The geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) of VZV antibody responses from prevaccination to 4 
weeks postvaccination of ZOSTAVAX among subjects 50 to 59 years of age is noninferior to 
that among subjects 60 year of age or older. 
(The  statistical  criterion  corresponded  to  a  lower  bound  of  the  two-sided  95  %  confidence 
interval  [CI]  on  the  GMFR  ratio  [50  to  59  years  of  age  vs.  60  years  of  age  or  older]  being 
>0.67). 
2.  The  GMFR  of  VZV  antibody  responses  from  prevaccination  to  4  weeks  postvaccination  of 
ZOSTAVAX is acceptable among subjects 50 to 59 years of age and among subjects 60 years 
of age or older 
(The statistical criterion corresponded to a lower bound of the two-sided 95 % CI of GMFR 
being >1.4 in each age group.) 
The noninferiority margin was identical to that used within the two individual studies for comparisons 
across vaccination groups. The acceptability lower bound was identical to that used in Protocol 011, 
but higher than the 1.2 fold rise criterion used in Protocol 010. 
Results 
Immunogenicity: Noninferiority comparison of VZV antibody response across age groups 
Table 1 summarises the VZV antibody responses by age group (50 to 59 years of age; >60 years of 
age) for the combined studies and for each study individually at day 1 and week 4 postvaccination in 
the  per-protocol  population.  In  each  study  and  in  the  2  studies  combined,  the  geometric  mean  titre 
(GMT) increased substantially from prevaccination to week 4 postvaccination in both age groups. The 
overall  GMTs  for  the  combined  studies  at  day  1  and  week  4  postvaccination  were  generally 
comparable  between  the  two  age  groups.  The  VZV  antibody  response,  measured  by  GMFR  from 
prevaccination to week 4 postvaccination, was also generally comparable between the 2 age groups, 
although numerically slightly higher in the 50 to 59 years of age group, which was consistent across 
the 2 studies.

Analysis of Acceptability of VZV Antibody Response 
The noninferiority analysis of the VZV antibody response between the age groups was based on the 
analysis  of  covariance  (ANCOVA)  model  in  which  the  natural-log-transformed  fold  rise  at  week  4 
postvaccination was the response variable, and age group, study, vaccination group, and natural-log-
transformed prevaccination titres were the covariates. After adjusting for the prevaccination titres, the 
estimated GMFR ratio (50 to 59 years of age/>60 years of age) was 1.13 (95% CI: 1.02 to 1.25, p= 
0.002). Since the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI was >0.67 and the one-sided p-value for testing 
the  noninferiority  hypothesis  was  <0.025,  the  VZV  antibody  response  induced  by  ZOSTAVAX  in 
subjects  50  to  59  years  of  age  was  found  to  be  noninferior  to  that  in  subjects  >60  years  of  age.  In 
addition,  the  fact  that  the  lower  bound  of  the  95%  CI  of  the  GMFR  ratio  was  >1  indicates  that  the 
GMFR at week 4 postvaccination was slightly higher (reached statistical significance) in subjects 50 to 
59 years of age than in subjects >60 years of age. 
To further quantify the effect of age, study, vaccination group and the prevaccination titer on the fold 
rise  post  vaccination,  the  results  of  the  ANCOVA  model  with  natural-log-transformed  fold  rise  at 
week 4 post vaccination as a response variable, and vaccination group, age group, protocol, and log-
transformed prevaccination titer as the covariates were provided (see table 2). As observed before, the 
younger  age  group  (50  to  59  years  of  age)  had  a  significantly  (marginally)  higher  VZV  antibody 
response at  week 4 postvaccination than did the older age group (>60 years of age). A significantly 
higher  VZV  antibody  response  was  observed  at  week  4  postvaccination  in  Protocol  010  than  in 
Protocol 011. 
The level of pre-vaccination VZV antibody titres had a statistically significant (p-value <0.001) effect 
on the VZV antibody response at week 4 postvaccination. The vaccination group within each study did 
not have a statistically significant effect on the fold rise at week 4 postvaccination after adjusting for 
the prevaccination titer.

As  planned  in  the  analysis  plan,  a  test  for  the  age-group-by-study  interaction  was  conducted  for  the 
GMFR from prevaccination to week 4 postvaccination. The interaction was not statistically significant 
(p-value=0.867)  at  the  10%  level,  which  indicates  that  the  VZV  antibody  responses  at  week  4 
postvaccination  in  the  2  age  groups  were  consistent  across  the  2  studies  (Protocol  010  and  Protocol 
011). 
Figure 1 shows the reverse cumulative distribution (RCD) of VZV antibody titres by age group and by 
visit.  Figure  2  displays  the  RCD  of  VZV  antibody  fold  rise  from  prevaccination  to  week  4 
postvaccination by age group in the per-protocol population. 
These  graphs  are  consistent  with  the  noninferiority  analysis  presented  in  Table  2  and  indicate  that 
ZOSTAVAX induced a slightly higher fold rise of VZV antibody response at week 4 postvaccination 
in the 50 to 59 years of age group than in the >60years of age group. 
 
 
 
The  results  of  the  analysis  of  the  GMFR  of  VZV  antibody  titres  from  prevaccination  to  week  4 
postvaccination for both age groups were also provided. The estimated GMFR of the VZV antibody 
response was 2.6 (95% CI: 2.4 to 2.9) in subjects 50 to 59 years of age and 2.3 (95% CI: 2.1 to 2.4) in 
subjects >60 years of age. Since each of the lower bounds of the 95% CI was >1.4, and the one-sided 
p-value for testing the acceptability hypothesis (GMFR >1.4) was <0.025, the criteria for acceptability 
of the VZV antibody responses induced by ZOSTAVAX in both age groups were met. 
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Duration of protection: 
The CHMP was concerned, that by vaccinating younger age groups, the outbreak of the disease could 
possibly be shifted to the older and more vulnerable age groups. Therefore the MAH was requested to 
commit to carefully follow up this age group and to discuss the need for extension studies in this age 
group. The MAH was further asked to present a benefit-risk assessment that takes into consideration 
the effect vaccination at an earlier age would have on the duration of immunity.  
In  his  response,  the  MAH  pointed  out  that  efficacy,  immunogenicity  and  epidemiologic  data  were 
available and show the following regarding immune response to varicella-zoster virus (VZV)  
•  Data  from  the  Shingles  Prevention  Study  (SPS)  suggested  no  waning  of  protection  against  HZ 
through 4 years after vaccination in subjects ≥60 years.  
•  Vaccine immunogenicity trends provide evidence that the protection against HZ observed in the 
SPS should extend to individuals 50 to 59 years of age.  
•  An estimated 300,000 people 50 to 59 years of age develop HZ every year in the EU25; the vast 
majority of them could be spared the pain and suffering of HZ by vaccination.  
•  There are no epidemiological data suggesting that developing HZ between 50 and 59 years of age 
prevents from developing HZ again later in life.  In this regard, denial of the benefit of vaccination 
against  HZ  for  the  population  50  to 59 years  of  age  should be  weighed  against  the  hypothetical 
 
 
 
 
 
 
concern that vaccination beginning at 50 years of age may lead to an increased rate of HZ later in 
life.  
Ongoing follow-up from the long-term extension of the SPS will evaluate the need for a later booster 
dose in subjects vaccinated ≥60 years at the age, and immunogenicity studies will then be necessary to 
evaluate the effect of a revaccination. For the age group ≥50 years of age the evaluation of a need for a 
booster dose will be addressed as committed by the MAH. 
The MAH estimated that persons vaccinated between 50 and 59 years of age should have the same or 
lower level of risk for HZ and PHN when they reach older ages, compared with the risk if they had not 
been  vaccinated.  However,  it  was  considered  that  an  assessment  of  the  long-term  impact  of 
vaccination on HZ epidemiology would take many years to answer. The MAH therefore committed to 
undertake  an  assessment  of  the  feasibility  of  a  postmarketing  surveillance  system  in  a  country  that 
would implement routine vaccination of individuals 50 to 59 years of age.  
The CHMP  agreed with the MAH’s position that concerns about a potential shift of HZ into a later 
phase  of  life  (individual  risk  following  early  HZ  vaccination)  or  to  older  age  categories 
(epidemiological  effect  of  routine  HZ  earlier  in  life)  cannot  be  taken  as  a  reason  for  withholding 
ZOSTAVAX from the group of 50 to 59 years old individuals.  
As  it  was  considered  that  a  significant  burden  of disease  exists  also  in  this  age  category,  which  can 
significantly  be  lowered  by  vaccination  with  ZOSTAVAX,  concerns  as  mentioned  above  were 
considered secondary. Furthermore, the concept of vaccination to protect from HZ or PHN is new and 
needs  to  be  followed  up  with  regard  to  defining  optimal  revaccination  schedules  and  probably  also 
with  regard  to  numbers  of  doses  needed  in  individual  age  categories  for  efficient  immunological 
stimulation.  
The  MAH  stated  that  over  a  period  of  4-5  years  there  was  only  insignificant  waning  of  the  initial 
immune response in a population vaccinated in the age range of 60 – 69 years (protocol 004). Control 
over  persistence  of  an  effective  immune  response  over  a  longer  period  of  time  will  be  ensured  by 
protocol 013 which aims at following up individuals vaccinated between 1998 and 2001 until the year 
2011. Annual reporting was requested by CHMP at the time of licensing of ZOSTAVAX. Given that 
follow-up  is  efficient,  i.e.  the  number  of  evaluable  subjects  remains  sufficiently  high  over  the 
observational  period  it  was  considered  that  the  understanding  of  long-term  effectiveness  of 
ZOSTAVAX vaccination will become clearer. Since immunogenicity of ZOSTAVAX (as of any other 
vaccine) is higher in younger compared to older age categories immunological long-term persistence 
data  from  protocol  013  are  transferable  to  the  50-59  years  old  individuals.  Nevertheless,  the  CHMP 
felt  that  the  MAH  should  commit  to  establish  age-specific  follow-up  protocols  based  on  the  routine 
implementation of ZOSTAVAX vaccination in individual (EU)-countries, on which the MAH agreed. 
Since there is no apparent change in the benefit-risk ratio for the 50-59 old individuals compared to 
individuals older than 60 years of age at the time of vaccination, the issue was considered solved for 
the time being.  
Impact on epidemiology and need for a booster dose 
In the light of the unclear duration of protection, the MAH was also asked to present all available data 
on the need and timing of a booster dose. 
Following  the  assessment  of  the  responses,  the  CHMP  considered  that  as  discussed  in  the  original 
application,  some  of  the  studies  considering  two  dose  schedules  demonstrated  a  further  increase  of 
immune  responses  following  a  second  dose  of  ZOSTAVAX.  The  CHMP  highlighted  that  the  final 
immune  response  did  not  depend  on  the  titre  of  the  vaccine  virus  but  only  on  the  number  of  doses 
given,  indicating  that  moderate  but  constant  exposure  to  varizella-zoster  virus  is  the  best  protection 
against  zoster  and  its  sequelae.  From  that  perspective  it  is  agreed  that  the  design  of  vaccination 
schedules needs to be refined based on efficient follow-up measures. Protocol 013 is in place to ensure 
long-term follow up of vaccinated individuals. Again, even if data collected from that protocol might 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be  extrapolated  to  younger  vaccinated  age  categories  an  age  specific  long-term  follow  up  design  is 
preferred to address the question of defining optimal time points for re-vaccination. 
The  CHMP  agreed  with  the  company  that  this  can  best  be  achieved  in  parallel  to  routine 
implementation  of  zoster  vaccination  in  individual  countries.  The  MAH  committed  to  keep  CHMP 
updated  whenever  such  vaccination  programs  start  in  individual  countries  and  should  provide 
appropriate  protocols  for  efficient  follow-up,  in  particular  of  the  younger  vaccinated  age  groups, 
which was considered appropriate by the CHMP. 
It is known that the incidence of HZ in subjects 50 to 59 years of age is lower than in subjects 60 years 
and older. Therefore, the CHMP considered that the epidemiology of the disease needs to be closely 
monitored  when  vaccinating  younger  age  groups  to  detect  potential  shifts  of  HZ  to  older  ages  and 
more severe outcomes. The MAH was therefore asked to present appropriate measures to detect these 
potential shifts. Furthermore, the MAH was asked to clarify the impact of vaccination in the younger 
age group on on-going studies. 
The MAH agreed that there is a need to monitor the impact of vaccinating younger age groups on the 
epidemiology  of  HZ  and  proposed  Monitoring  of  HZ  epidemiology  by  large-linked  U.S.  automated 
database,  such  as  that  at  a  managed  care  organization  (MCO).  In  addition,  a  MCO  database  was 
considered to be helpful to monitor the need for hospitalization due to HZ among HZ patients and to 
determine potential changes of HZ severity over time. However, such a postmarketing observational 
vaccine effectiveness study in the U.S. would require that ZOSTAVAX be approved in the U.S. for 
individuals 50 years of age or older, and that routine vaccination is implemented in this age group, at 
least in the MCO where the study would be conducted. Should these conditions be met in the next few 
years, the MAH agreed to opt for an effectiveness study to address the issue of long-term impact of 
HZ  vaccination  on  the  epidemiology  of  HZ.  The  MAH  further  committed  to  provide  a  preliminary 
concept sheet for this study to clarify the intended design, structure and organisation of the study. 
Additionally,  as  indicated  above,  an  age-specific  long-term  follow-up  design  was  supported  by  the 
CHMP to address the question of whether wide implementation of a zoster vaccination program for 
persons greater than 50 years of age would change the age-specific epidemiology of HZ.  The CHMP 
agreed  that  this  can  best  be  achieved  in  parallel  to  routine  implementation  of  zoster  vaccination  in 
individual countries. 
The  MAH  committed  to  regularly  update  the  CHMP  whenever  such  a  widespread  vaccination 
program is implemented in a country where HZ surveillance would be feasible and will provide a draft 
protocol  for  monitoring  age-specific  HZ  epidemiology  once  routine  vaccination  of  individuals  50 
years of age and older is implemented in that country.   
Concerning stratification of age groups, the following points were considered important: 
•  For  the  younger  cohort  (50  to  59  years  of  age),  it  was  expected  that  if  the  immunogenicity  of 
ZOSTAVAX is at least equivalent to that in individuals ≥60 years of age, then the reduction in HZ 
incidence  obtained  through  vaccination  will  be  at  least  equivalent  to  that  observed  in  older 
subjects.    This  assumption  was  based  on  the  data  from  the  SPS  which  show  greater 
immunogenicity and efficacy in subjects 60 to 69 years of age compared with that in subjects ≥70 
years of age.  In addition, the study data found that higher immune responses were associated with 
a reduced risk of developing HZ.  
•  For  the  older  cohort  (≥60  years  of  age),  given  equivalent  immunogenicity  in  new  studies, 
comparable efficacy was inferred. As demonstrated in the SPS, the administration of ZOSTAVAX 
in this age group was associated with increased protection against both HZ and PHN. 
The CHMP agreed with the position of the MAH that potential changes in the epidemiology of HZ can 
only be observed once vaccination against HZ has been widely implemented. For the time being, data 
can  therefore  only  be  collected  from  past  clinical  studies  focused  on  the  long-term  follow-up  of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
vaccinated individuals. In this respect, Protocol 013 will follow up vaccinated individuals until 2011. 
These individuals were over 60 years of age at the time of vaccination. However, it seems to be highly 
unlikely that shifts in the epidemiology of HZ can be detected within this study. Potential effects of 
routine HZ vaccination will require large sample sizes and long-term follow-up periods. Only under 
these  circumstances  can  age-specific  (re-)  vaccination  protocols  be  designed  in  order  to    assess 
effectiveness  of  HZ  vaccination  accurately..  However,  controlled  surveillance  is  only  possible  once 
HZ vaccination has routinely been implemented in vaccination programs. This is not the case currently 
but  cannot  be  taken  as  a  valid  reason  to  withhold  ZOSTAVAX  from  any  age  category  that  suffers 
from  significant  disease  burden  due  to  HZ.  Efficacy  of  ZOSTAVAX  against  HZ  or  PHN  has 
unequivocally been demonstrated in the original application for individuals > 60 years of age. Based 
on  immunogenicity  results  provided  with  this  variation  application  (protocols  010  and  011)  there  is 
currently not a single piece of evidence to believe that efficacy will be different for the 50-59 years old 
individuals. Thus, the immediate risk-benefit ratio is identical for both age categories. Whether or not 
this profile will change over time cannot be estimated for the time being. The CHMP reiterated that 
the MAH is encouraged to submit relevant protocols to CHMP in parallel with routine implementation 
of ZOSTAVAX vaccination in individual MS following the launch of the product as described above 
Impact of gpELISA titres on the risk of developing HZ 
As  in  this  variation  the  immunogenicity  was  bridged  using  gpELISA  titre  data  from  4  weeks  post 
vaccination, the CHMP asked the MAH to clarify if gpELISA titres at 4 weeks post vaccination also 
were associated with a significant reduction in the risk of developing HZ. 
Although  the  SPS  did  not  measure  immune  responses  at  4  weeks  post  vaccination,  the  MAH  stated 
that association of 4-week titres with HZ protection could be inferred by the correlation profiles seen 
in the SPS and the antibody kinetics data in ZOSTAVAX Protocol 007.  
Protocol  007  was  designed  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  immunogenicity  after  1  and  2  doses  of 
ZOSTAVAX  in  210  adults,  60 years  of  age  or  older.  Subjects  were  randomly  assigned  to  receive  2 
doses,  42  days  apart,  of  either  ZOSTAVAX  or  placebo.  VZV  antibody  levels  were  measured  in  all 
subjects by gpELISA at prevaccination and at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, and  32 weeks 
after  the  first  vaccination.    Additional  time  points  were  tested  for  subjects  enrolled  in  a  Kinetics 
Substudy.  
The  VZV  antibody  GMT  and  GMFR  from  baseline  at  2  weeks  and  6  weeks  postvaccination  in  the 
ZOSTAVAX group were significantly higher than those in the placebo group.  The analyses of GMT 
ratios  at  each  time  point  postvaccination  (estimated  ratio  between  the  ZOSTAVAX  group  and  the 
placebo  group)  are  presented  in  Table  3.  The  GMT  ratios  were  higher  at  2  weeks  postvaccination 
compared  with  6  weeks  postvaccination  following  any  vaccination.    Additionally,  the  observed 
GMFRs at 2 weeks Postdose 1 and 6 weeks Postdose 1 in the ZOSTAVAX group were 1.9 and 1.6, 
respectively.  The  higher  responses  observed  at  2  weeks  Postdose  1  suggest  that  the  peak  of  the 
immune response occurs earlier than 6 weeks postvaccination.  In addition, significant boosting was 
seen at 2 weeks Postdose 2.  
The MAH further responded that in the CMI Substudy of the SPS, the vaccine effect on the reduction 
of  HZ  incidence  was  best  correlated  with  the  VZV  antibody  response  at  6  weeks  postvaccination 
measured by gpELISA (titer and foldrise from prevaccination). A Cox regression analysis showed a 
statistically significant inverse trend for risk of developing HZ with increasing antibody responses by 
gpELISA  at  6  weeks  postvaccination  (p<0.001).  Based  on  this  model,  each  1  log-unit  increase  in 
antibody  titer  was  associated  with  a  significant  reduction  (38.0%;  95%  CI  =  20.9,  51.5%;  p-value 
<0.001) in the risk of HZ.  Therefore, as the VZV antibody response measured by gpELISA at earlier 
time  points  correlates  with  that  at  6  weeks  postvaccination,  and  as  the  VZV  antibody  responses 
measured by gpELISA at 6 weeks postvaccination correlate with the clinical outcome of developing 
HZ, it was inferred that the VZV antibody response measured by gpELISA at 4 weeks postvaccination 
also correlates with the vaccine effect. Therefore, the VZV antibody response measured by gpELISA 
at 4 weeks postvaccination in individuals vaccinated with ZOSTAVAX is an indirect measurement of 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the  vaccine  effect  against  HZ,  and  can  be  used  for  bridging  immunogenicity  to  efficacy  in  clinical 
studies.  
The CHMP pointed out that gpELISA values already peak two weeks post dose 1 or 2 indicating that 
values measured either 4 or 6 weeks post vaccination will equally correlate with the reduction of HZ 
and considered therefore that the MAH’s response was acceptable. 
3.3 
Clinical safety 
Data from previous clinical trials evaluated the safety of the frozen formulation zoster vaccine showed 
that  across  these  clinical  studies,  in  which  more  than  20,000  subjects  received  frozen  formulation 
zoster vaccine, the vaccine was generally well tolerated.  
Methods 
In  Protocol  010  all  subjects  were  followed  for  safety  for  28  days  postvaccination.  Injection-site 
reactions, rashes, medications and/or other vaccinations, oral temperatures (if the subject felt feverish), 
and  other  adverse  experiences  were  recorded  on  a  VRC.  At  the  end  of  the  28-day  follow-up  period 
(day  29  to  35),  study  site  personnel  reviewed  all  VRCs  to  ensure  that  all  rashes  and  adverse 
experiences were reported. Additionally, at the week 4 visit and at the time subjects were seen for a 
rash  or  vaccine-specific  illness,  site  personnel  questioned  subjects  regarding  exposure  to  varicella 
and/or  HZ  since  vaccination  and  entered  the  information  on  the  appropriate  Case  Report  Forms 
(CRFs). 
Subjects were to report immediately to study personnel any episodes of varicella, varicella-like rash, 
HZ, or HZ-like rash, at any time during the 28-day safety follow-up period, to be seen by the study 
physician within 72 hours of rash onset, and to undergo physical examination by the study physician 
until no new lesions appeared and all older lesions were no longer palpable. 
Subjects were considered to have completed the study upon returning a completed VRC. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 367 subjects, 50 years of age and older were vaccinated in Protocol 011. Of these, 182 were 
randomised  to  the  refrigerated  formulation  zoster  vaccine  group  and  185  were  randomised  to  the 
frozen formulation group. The study population included subjects ≥50 years of age in order to provide 
immunogenicity and safety data in an expanded age group. Enrolment was age-stratified in a 1:2 ratio 
(50 to 59 years and ≥60 years, respectively). 
Results 
Table 3 presents an integrated summary of the number and percentage of subjects with clinical adverse 
experiences  reported  within  28  days  postvaccination,  by  age  group,  for  subjects  vaccinated  with 
ZOSTAVAX  in  the  combined  protocols.  Safety  follow-up  was  obtained  for  1112  of  the  1120 
vaccinated subjects. In Protocol 010, all vaccinated subjects with safety follow-up where included in 
the safety summaries and analyses presented in this section. In Protocol 011, only subjects with safety 
follow-up  during  the  28-day  period  following  administration  of  ZOSTAVAX  were  included.  The 
safety  evaluation  following  administration  of  placebo  and/or  influenza  vaccine  were  not  included  in 
the  following  summaries  and  analyses,  except  for  those  subjects  who  reported  systemic  clinical 
adverse experiences following the concomitant administration of influenza vaccine and ZOSTAVAX.

‡ Discontinued = Subject discontinued from therapy.  
Percentages are calculated based on the number of subjects with follow-up.  
As  shown  above  60.5%  of  subjects  50  to  59  years  of  age  reported  one  or  more  clinical  adverse 
experiences,  whereas  44.2%  of  subjects  ≥60  years  of  age  reported  one  or  more  clinical  adverse 
experiences.  In  subjects  50  to  59  years  of  age,  approximately  25.1%  of  subjects  reported  systemic 
clinical  adverse  experiences,  but  only  5.8%  of  subjects  reported  vaccine-related  systemic  clinical 
adverse experiences. In subjects ≥60 years of age, 19.0% of subjects reported systemic clinical adverse 
experiences, but only 2.9% of subjects reported vaccine-related systemic clinical adverse experiences. 
These results indicate overall a higher rate of adverse events in the lower age group. 
Table 4 below displays the estimated risk of developing clinical adverse experiences in each age group 
stratified by protocol and vaccination group, along with the estimated risk differences between the 2 
age  groups  with  their  95%  CIs.  In  general,  the  two  age  groups  were  comparable  with  respect  to 
reporting  serious  adverse  experience  as  the  corresponding  95%  CIs  for  the  risk  differences  included 
zero. The risk of reporting systemic and injection-site adverse experiences in subjects 50 to 59 years of 
age  than  in  subjects  >60  years  of  age  reached  statistical  significance,  since  the  95%  CI  for  the  risk 
differences excluded zero.

The  adverse  experience  logs  of  both  studies  010  and  011  regarding  the  severity  confirm  that  the 
majority of the experiences were mild and moderate in both age groups. 
One  (0.3%)  out  of  382  subjects  with  safety  follow-up  and  5  (0.7%)  out  of  730  subjects  with  safety 
follow-up reported serious clinical adverse experiences in the 50 to 59 years of age group and the >60 
years  of  group,  respectively.  These  events  were  convulsion,  gastroenteritis,  basal  cell  carcinoma, 
cardiac  failure  congestive,  aortic  valve  stenosis,  arrhythmia,  myocardial  infarction,  acute  pulmonary 
oedema,  chronic  obstructive  pulmonary  disease,  pneumonia,  respiratory  failure  and  upper  limb 
fracture. No ZOSTAVAX related serious clinical adverse experience was reported in the two studies. 
This  provides  97.5%  confidence  that  the  true  vaccine  related  serious  adverse  experience  rate  was 
<0.96% (1 out of every 104 subjects) in 50 to 59 years of age. Furthermore, no deaths occurred during 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the  conduct  of  either  study.  One  (1)  subject  >60  years  of  age  discontinued  due  to  a  serious  clinical 
adverse experience in Protocol 011.  
The MAH presented also a summary of the number and percentage of subjects with specific systemic 
clinical adverse experiences (incidence ≥1% in one or both age groups), by system organ class and age 
group, days 1 to 28 postvaccination for the combined clinical studies. 
Approximately 25% of the subjects 50 to 59 years of age and 19% of the subjects >60 years of age 
reported  at  least  one  systemic  clinical  adverse  experience.  The  most  commonly  reported  systemic 
clinical adverse experiences in subjects 50 to 59 years of age were headache (4.5%), upper respiratory 
tract infection (2.9%), and back pain (2.1%). Among these most commonly reported systemic clinical 
adverse experiences, 1.0% of the headaches were deemed to be vaccine-related. The most commonly 
reported systemic clinical adverse experience in subjects >60 years of age was upper respiratory tract 
infection  (2.1%)  and  0.3%  of  these  were  deemed  to  be  vaccine-related.  Overall,  the  number  and 
percentage of subjects reporting any systemic clinical adverse experiences were greater in the younger 
age group than in the older age group. 
Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety in the 50 to 59 year age group 
The CHMP noted that the number and percentage of subjects reporting any systemic clinical adverse 
experience were greater in the 50 to 59 year group as compared to the > 60 year group. The CHMP 
further  noted,  that  the  AEs  from  the  SOC  Nervous  System  Disorder  were  5.5%  in  the  younger  age 
group  while  1.5%  in  the  older  age  group  although  1.6%  were  determined  vaccine  related  in  the 
younger  group  and  1.1%  in  the  older  group.  The  CHMP  considered  that  the  nature  of  neurological 
AEs  other  than  headache  should  be  clarified,  especially  regarding  serious  AEs.  Since  vaccine 
reactogenicity  was  higher  in  the  50-59  year  group,  the  CHMP  requested  that  safety  follow-up 
including rare serious adverse events should be monitored during widespread use.  
The MAH clarified in his response the nature of the remaining nervous system adverse experiences, in 
addition to headache. Convulsion (n=1 in the 50-to-59 stratum), dizziness (n=1 in the 50-to-59 stratum 
and  n=3  in  the  60-and-older  stratum),  and  lethargy  (n=1  in  the  50-to-59  stratum)  were  the  other 
nervous system adverse experiences reported. Of these, only the case of convulsion was considered by 
the  investigator  to  be  a  serious  clinical  adverse  experience.  However,  it  was  not  considered  to  be 
vaccine-related and was determined that it was induced by fatigue.  
The  overall  incidence  of  adverse  experiences  from  the  Nervous  System  organ  class  (SOC)  was 
statistically higher in the younger age group than in the older age group, with headache reported at a 
significantly  higher  frequency  by  subjects  50  to  59  years  of  age  than  by  subjects  ≥60  years  of  age.  
These  adverse  experiences  were  not  limited  to  one  type  of  adverse  experience  and  the  numbers  of 
reported experiences  were  still quite low. In addition, the risk of reporting systemic clinical adverse 
experiences  was  slightly  higher  in  subjects  50  to  59  years  of  age  than  in  subjects  ≥60  years  of  age, 
across  almost  all  SOCs.  No  other  specific  adverse  event  stands  out  as  being  more  common  with 
decreasing age.  
Therefore,  only  the  difference  in  risk  of  headache  was  significantly higher  among  subjects  50  to  59 
years of age than in subjects ≥60 years of age. It should be noted that headache was reported as mild 
or moderate in intensity in most cases and no other significant age-related trends were observed.  
The  MAH  agreed  that  the  assessment  of  safety  in  individuals  50  to  59  years  of  age,  including 
observation for rare serious adverse experiences, should continue post marketing. The post marketing 
setting  will  permit  a  better  monitoring  for  rare  adverse  experiences  at  a  level  that  is  not  achievable 
through clinical trials and committed to monitor serious AEs stratified by age in the next PSURs 
The  CHMP  considered  that  a  more  detailed  analysis  of  the  SOC  “nervous  system  disorders”  as 
provided by the MAH would not support any evidence for increased neurological disorders in the 50-
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
59  years  old  vaccinated  individuals  compared  to  over  60  years  old  individuals.  The  spectrum  of 
reported  disorders  is  broad  and  unspecific  and  correlation  to  vaccination  not  possible,  therefore  the 
CHMP considered the issue resolved. 
3.4 
Risk Management plan 
The  MAH  included  an  updated  Risk  Management  Plan  (RMP)  in  the  application,  which  has  been 
adapted to the expanded age group of individuals from 50 years of age and older. The MAH presented 
the  safety  concerns  together  with  the  respective  pharmacovigilance  activities  and  proposed  risk 
minimisation activities as outlined in the table below.

1. Routine Pharmacovigilance activities 
2. Three studies as part of a regulatory 
commitment: 
- Post marketing, placebo-controlled general 
safety study 
- Large-scale (20 000 vaccinated subjects ) 
observational post licensure safety study 
- Clinical trial to assess long-term duration of 
protection among subjects who received the 
vaccine during the efficacy trial, Protocol 004 
One  of  the  safety  concerns  presented  in  the  RMP  was  the  duration  of  protection  afforded  by 
vaccination  with  ZOSTAVAX,  which  is  unknown  at  present.  The  initial  application  for  licensure 
included follow-up for up to 4 years postvaccination for efficacy. The need for a booster dose, if any, 
is not known. 
Concerns have been raised regarding the possibility that immunisation with ZOSTAVAX may delay 
the  onset  of  HZ  if  the  duration  of  protection  from  a  single  dose  is  insufficient,  therefore  possibly 
shifting  the  occurrence  of  HZ  to  an  older  age.  The  MAH  committed  to  completing  a  long-term 
persistence  study  of  efficacy  among  subjects  who  received  the  vaccine  during  the  efficacy  trial, 
Protocol  004.  Extension  of  follow-up  of  approximately  7000  vaccine  recipients  and  approximately 
6900  placebo  recipients  in  Protocol  004  is  ongoing  and  was  initiated  in  2004.  By  design,  this 
amendment allows for collection of persistence of efficacy data through 4 to 6 years postvaccination.  
In order to study longer-term persistence of efficacy, the MAH is currently conducting Protocol 013 
(with  an  anticipated  number  of  N~7000  participants),  which  extends  follow-up  of  these  vaccine 
recipients through approximately 10 years postvaccination. These subjects were vaccinated in 1998 to 
2001  and  if  waning  of  protection  occurs,  it  will  be  detected  in  this  study  population  before  vaccine 
efficacy is expected to wane in the general vaccinated public. Based on the observations in Protocol 
005, should vaccine efficacy wane in later years postvaccination, subsequent doses of vaccine would 
be expected to boost VZV-specific immunity.  
Therefore, Annex II has been updated accordingly to reflect the latest version of the RMP. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3.5  Overall Discussion and Benefit/Risk Assessment 
Immunogenicity of ZOSTAVAX observed in studies 010 and 011 (as measured by gpELISA units in 
the individual and integrated analyses) was within the range observed in previous studies, which were 
previously assessed.  
There was a slight difference in GMTs and GMFRs before and after vaccination between the different 
age  groups  receiving  ZOSTAVAX.  The  GMTs  and  GMFRs  were  higher  in  the  age  group  50 to  59 
years  of  age  in  comparison  to  the  age  group  >  60  years  of  age  which  was  expected  since  already 
previously observed. Finally, all pre-defined statistical criteria were met for immunogenicity analyses 
regarding the age groups below and above 60 years.  
The  CHMP  could  not  identify  any  individual  or  collective  risk  linked  to  the  extension  of  the  age 
indication of ZOSTAVAX for individuals from 50 years of age onwards. Furthermore, the favourable 
risk-benefit ratio identified in the original Marketing Authorisation application for over 60 years old 
individuals remains unchanged. This can be also extended to the younger age category as supported by 
studies 010 and 011. The CHMP further concluded that there is currently no ideal tool to investigate 
immediate and long-term effects that HZ vaccination might have on the general population. Protocol 
013 describing the long-term follow-up of individuals over 60 years of age at the time of vaccination 
was  considered  unsuitable  to  fully  address  the  initial  concerns  regarding  the  younger  population. 
These  concerns  can  only  be  addressed  specifically  once  HZ  vaccination  has  been  implemented  into 
national vaccination schedules, which is currently not the case. 
For the time being concerns discussed above do not justify to withhold vaccination against HZ from 
the group of 50 – 59 years old individuals which in total suffers from a significant burden of disease 
caused  by  HZ.  From  this  perspective,  variation  on  the  extension  of  age  range  was  considered 
approvable  as  the  MAH  committed  to  provide  appropriate  study  plans  in  time  to  measure  effects 
prompted  by routine  HZ  vaccination  once  ZOSTAVAX  is  implemented  for  routine  vaccination  in  a 
given country. 
No safety signals that could give rise to a concern have been detected for any of the age categories, 
which were investigated in the two groups of study 010 and 011 receiving ZOSTAVAX.  A slightly 
higher  proportion  of  subjects  reporting  overall  systemic  and  injection-site  adverse  experiences  is 
observed  in  the  age  group  50  to  59  years  of  age  than  in  subjects  >  60  years  of  age.  Although  the 
CHMP considered that this finding could not be translated in a true clinical concern for most of the 
events,  the  CHMP  pointed  out  that  the  adverse  events  related  to  the  System  Organ  Class  (SOC) 
“nervous  system  disorder”  were  higher  in  the  younger  age  group  than  in  the  older  age  group.  The 
CHMP considered that the nature of these events were sufficiently clarified by the MAH. However, 
the  MAH  agreed  with  the  CHMP  that  rare  serious  adverse  events  will  be  monitored  in  the  next 
PSURs, startified by age group. 
Systemic clinical adverse events seen in the younger age category were not serious in general (most 
commonly  headache,  symptoms  of  upper  respiratory  infection,  back  pain)  and  were  not  considered 
clinically significant by the CHMP.

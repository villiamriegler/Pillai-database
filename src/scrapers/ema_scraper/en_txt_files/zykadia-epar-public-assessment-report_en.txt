2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Problem statement 
Lung cancer has been among the most common cancers in the world for several decades. The 2012 
worldwide estimates of cancer incidence and mortality by GLOBOCAN, indicate a total of 1.8 million new 
lung cancer cases and 1.6 million lung cancer related deaths, accounting for 13.0% of all cancer cases 
(except non-melanoma skin cancers) and 19.4% of all cancer deaths (except non-melanoma skin 
cancers). Furthermore, lung cancer incidence rates were two-fold higher in males compared to females 
(1,241,601 and 583,100, respectively). In 2013, the estimated number of lung cancer related deaths is 
159,480 in the United States (Siegel et al 2013) and 269,610 in the European Union (Malvezzi et al 2013). 
The two most prevalent sub-types of lung cancer are small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC). Approximately 85% of all lung cancers are NSCLC, which is frequently further subdivided into 
non-squamous carcinoma (including adenocarcinoma, large-cell carcinoma, and other cell types) and 
squamous cell (epidermoid) carcinoma. 
Adenocarcinoma (40% of lung cancers) is the most common type of lung cancer, and is also the most 
frequently occurring in non-smokers as reported in United States (US) data (American Cancer Society 
2013). 
Non-small cell lung cancer is associated with high mortality rates as >70% of the patients are diagnosed 
with locally advanced or metastatic disease (Molina et al 2008) [stages III and IV according to the 
American joint committee on cancer staging (AJCC)]. Historically, patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC have been treated with standard chemotherapy and/or radiation, and while these 
treatments may provide modest survival benefits, they are rarely curative. 
Systemic chemotherapy is a cornerstone in the management of locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. 
Standard first-line treatment typically consists of a platinum-based doublet (cisplatin or carboplatin in 
combination with other chemotherapy agents), unless a patient has a known mutation, candidate for 
targeted therapy (NCCN Guidelines v3.2012, Vansteenkiste et al 2013). The outcomes with this type of 
chemotherapy remain poor, with response rates of 15 to 35% and median progression-free survival (PFS) 
and overall survival (OS) of 4 to 7 months and 10 to 16 months, respectively (Scagliotti et al 2008, 
Ciuleanu et al 2009, Ettinger et al 2010, Paz-Ares et al 2012). 
Pemetrexed/cisplatin (or carboplatin) combination therapy and carboplatin/paclitaxel with (or without) 
bevacizumab represent a therapeutic option in patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC. These 
regimens are commonly used based on phase III randomised trials (NCCN version 1.2015) 
Recently, pemetrexed-based regimens have been used in adenocarcinomas (if patients are not candidate 
for targeted therapy), because taxane-based regimens are associated with more toxicity (e.g. 
neurotoxicity). 
The outcomes with second-line chemotherapy are dismal, with response rates of less than 10%, median 
PFS of 2 to 3 months, and median OS of 5 to 8 months (Shepherd et al 2000, Fossella et al 2000, Hanna 
et al 2004). 
Although chemotherapy is appropriate for many patients with lung cancer, there is a sense that the use 
of traditional chemotherapeutic agents has reached a therapeutic plateau. Increased understanding of 
EMA/170114/2015  
Page 12/105 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
cancer biology has revealed numerous potential therapeutic strategies targeting oncogenic signal 
transduction pathways. Where NSCLC was previously considered to be a single disease treated with 
standard cytotoxic chemotherapy, it is now becoming more appropriate to consider NSCLC as a collection 
of disease subtypes according to the driving oncogenic aberration, and to select treatment accordingly 
(Bang 2011). 
Personalized targeted therapy for advanced NSCLC relies primarily on the concept of “oncogene 
addiction”, in which cancers that contain multiple genetic abnormalities rely on only one or several genes 
for the maintenance of the malignant phenotype and their survival (Ma 2012). Several molecular 
aberrations have been identified in NSCLC, with subsequent development of drugs that target these 
aberrations. Gefitinib, afatinib and erlotinib for the treatment of NSCLC harbouring epidermal growth 
factor receptor (EGFR) mutations or overexpression, and crizotinib for the treatment of NSCLC with the 
anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion translocation oncogenes are examples of this rationale targeted 
approach to treating cancer (Ma 2012, Yang et al 2012a). 
Multiple large randomized clinical trials have demonstrated that patients harbouring activating EGFR 
mutations benefit more from treatment with EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) than with standard 
chemotherapy in terms of response rate (62 to 85%), PFS, toxicity profile and quality of life (reviewed in 
NCCN Guidelines v3.2012, Gettinger and Lynch 2011). The success of EGFR TKIs highlights the 
importance of identifying specific NSCLC molecular drivers to appropriately develop targeted agents for 
treating specific patient populations.  
Anaplastic lymphoma kinase, a receptor tyrosine kinase, was first identified as a fusion protein resulting 
from chromosomal translocation in the majority of anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL). When fused to 
other proteins, ALK becomes constitutively active, leading to increased catalytic kinase function, signal 
transduction activity, and oncogenic function. ALK has since been linked with many different fusion 
partners in different tumour types (Soda et al 2007). 
The frequency of ALK gene rearrangements in patients with NSCLC (referred to as ALK positive NSCLC 
from here onwards) is relatively low; it is present in approximately 2 to 7% of tumours tested. However, 
considering the high incidence of lung cancer, this small percentage translates into about 60,000 patients 
annually worldwide (Kwak et al 2010, Shaw et al 2013, Weickhardt et al 2012).  
Patients with ALK-positive NSCLC are associated with specific demographic and clinical features, including 
never or light smoking history, younger age, and adenocarcinoma histology (Shaw et al 2009, Wong et al 
2009, Rodig et al 2009). In addition, several reports have associated ALK positivity with a more advanced 
stage at diagnosis and worse prognosis (Shaw et al 2009, Yang et al 2012b). Further, ALK gene 
rearrangements are largely mutually exclusive with EGFR or KRAS mutations (Gainor et al 2013), 
consistent with the notion that ALK gene rearrangements defines a unique molecular subset of NSCLC. In 
these patients, ALK gene rearrangements serve as a key and strong oncogenic driver for NSCLC and 
represent a critical therapeutic target susceptible to targeted ALK kinase inhibition.  
Crizotinib, a non-specific small molecule ALK inhibitor is the only targeted agent currently approved for 
the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive NSCLC. Early single-arm trials of crizotinib 
in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC demonstrated impressive activity and with clinical benefit response 
rates of 50 to 61% and duration of response of 6 to 10 months (Ou 2011). Based on these data, crizotinib 
(Xalkori) received conditional approval in the European Union (EU) (October 2012) for the treatment of 
adults with previously treated ALK-positive advanced NSCLC. 
The clinical benefit of crizotinib treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive 
NSCLC in the second-line setting following treatment with at least one prior chemotherapy regimen has 
been confirmed in a phase III trial (PROFILE 1007). Crizotinib prolonged PFS to a median of 7.7 months 
EMA/170114/2015  
Page 13/105 
 
 
  
 
 
 
compared to 3.0 months in patients who received single-agent chemotherapy (Hazard ratio=0.49; 95% 
CI: 0.37–0.64; p<0.001). In addition, crizotinib significantly increased overall response rate over 
chemotherapy (65% vs. 20%, p<0.001), and improved symptom control and quality of life. The analysis 
of the OS rate was not sufficiently mature to draw conclusions, and was confounded by the cross-over of 
patients from chemotherapy to crizotinib (Shaw et al 2013). 
While crizotinib is effective in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC, disease progression invariably occurs, 
typically within one year, due to the development of acquired drug resistance. Crizotinib resistant 
ALK-positive NSCLC frequently conserves the ALK gene rearrangements, but may result from the 
development of resistant ALK mutations, ALK amplification, and/or activation of alternate aberrant 
signalling pathways (Katayama et al 2012, Doebele et al 2012). Furthermore, not all patients respond to 
or tolerate crizotinib treatment. 
About the product 
Ceritinib is a selective and potent inhibitor of ALK. It inhibits autophosphorylation of ALK, and thus 
ALK-mediated phosphorylation of downstream signalling proteins, and proliferation of ALK-dependent 
cancer cells in both in vitro and in vivo models.  
ALK translocation determines expression of the resulting fusion protein and consequent aberrant ALK 
signaling in NSCLC. In the majority of NSCLC cases, EML4 is the translocation partner for ALK; this 
generates an EML4 ALK fusion protein containing the protein kinase domain of ALK fused to the N terminal 
part of EML4. Ceritinib was demonstrated to be effective against EML4 ALK kinase activity in a NSCLC cell 
line (H2228), resulting in inhibition of cell proliferation in vitro and regression of tumours in H2228 
derived xenografts in mouse and rat. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: Treatment of adult patients with previously treated 
anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC). 
The recommended indication for approval is: Zykadia is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously 
treated with crizotinib. 
Treatment with ceritinib should be initiated and supervised by a physician experienced in the use of 
anti-cancer medicinal products. 
An accurate and validated ALK assay is necessary for the selection of ALK-positive NSCLC patients. 
ALK-positive NSCLC status should be established prior to initiation of ceritinib therapy. Assessment for 
ALK-positive NSCLC should be performed by laboratories with demonstrated proficiency in the specific 
technology being utilised. 
The recommended dose of ceritinib is 750 mg taken orally once daily at the same time each day. Ceritinib 
capsules should be swallowed whole with water. The capsules should not be chewed or crushed. Ceritinib 
capsules must be taken on an empty stomach. No food should be eaten for at least two hours before and 
for two hours after the dose of ceritinib is taken. 
The maximum recommended dose is 750 mg daily. Treatment should continue as long as clinical benefit 
is observed. If a dose is missed, the patient should make up that dose, unless the next dose is due within 
12 hours. However ceritinib should be discontinued in patients unable to tolerate 300 mg daily. 
Temporary dose interruption and/or dose reduction of Zykadia may be required based on individual safety 
and tolerability. If dose reduction is required due to any adverse drug reaction (ADR), then this should be 
EMA/170114/2015  
Page 14/105 
 
 
  
 
 
 
achieved by decrements of 150 mg daily. Early identification and management of ADRs with standard 
supportive care measures should be considered. 
Approximately 54% of patients initiating treatment at the recommended dose of 750 mg required at least 
one dose adjustment due to adverse reaction, with a median time to first dose reduction of approximately 
7 weeks. 
The below table summarizes recommendations for dose interruption, reduction or discontinuation of 
ceritinib in the management of selected ADRs.

General information 
The 
chemical 
name 
of 
ceritinib 
is 
5-Chloro-2-N-{5-methyl-4-(piperidin-4-yl)-2-[(propan-2-yl)oxy]phenyl}-4-N-[2-(propane-2-sulfonyl)p
henyl]pyrimidine-2,4-diamine and it has the following structure: 
EMA/170114/2015  
Page 16/105 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Ceritinib is a white to almost white or light yellow powder which has good solubility in very acidic aqueous 
medium. The solubility decreases significantly with increasing pH. A good solubility is found in the organic 
medium methanol. 
The molecular structure has been fully characterised by elemental analysis, ultraviolet absorption 
spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy, proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H-NMR) spectroscopy, carbon 
nuclear magnetic resonance (13C-NMR) spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, X-ray powder diffraction 
(XRPD), and single crystal X-ray diffraction.  
Ceritinib exists in two polymorphic forms: modification A and B. Modification B is thermodynamically 
unstable under the manufacturing process conditions of the active substance. The X-ray diffraction 
pattern of ceritinib batches manufactured to date demonstrate that the diffractograms correspond to that 
of modification A. Modification A was selected for development and commercial use. 
Ceritinib is non-hygroscopic and achiral. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Certinib  is  manufactured  by  a  convergent  six  step  synthesis  (including  salt  formation  and  free  base 
formation, excluding recrystallizations of wet isolated solids), followed by an additional milling step using 
three  commercially  available  well-defined  starting  materials  with  acceptable  specifications.  The 
characterisation  of  the  active  substance  and  its  impurities  is  in  accordance  with  the  EU  guideline  on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to 
their origin and characterised.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Specification 
Certinib’s specification includes tests for appearance, particle size (light diffraction), identity (IR, XRPD), 
assay (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), loss on drying, sulphated ash (Ph Eur), heavy metals (ICP-OES), 
trace metals (ICP-MS), clarity of solution (Ph Eur), colour of solution (Ph Eur), impurities (HPLC), and 
microbial enumeration test (Ph Eur). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis data of 29 pilot and commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
EMA/170114/2015  
Page 17/105 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
Stability 
The 2 packaging formats used for stability studies were sealed polyethylene bag inside a quadruple 
laminated foil bag which simulates the actual packaging for bulk batches and two sealed flat LDPE bags 
inside steel drums with tight closures.  
Three pilot scale batches of ceritinib from the proposed manufacturers stored for up to 12 months under 
long term conditions at 25°C / 60% RH and intermediate conditions at 30°C / 75% RH, up to 6 months 
under  accelerated  conditions  at  40°C  /  75%  RH  and  up  to  3  months  at  50°C  according  to  the  ICH 
guidelines in tight packaging and very tight packaging were provided. 
The parameters tested were appearance, identity (X-ray diffraction), related substances (HPLC), loss on 
drying, clarity of the solution, colour of the solution, assay (HPLC), and microbial  enumeration tests.  
The active substance is chemically stable since no significant changes and no degradation were observed 
under either long term or accelerated conditions in either packaging format. Neither polymorphic form nor 
the content of volatiles changed over the storage period. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on two batches. Additionally, active 
substance from these two batches was exposed to stressed conditions (50 or 60 oC, <30 or 75% RH) in 
either open containers or in two LDPE bags inside steel drums with tight closure. Ceritinib was also tested 
at 80 oC stored in ampoules in the presence of N2 (with and without water) or O 2. No degradation was 
observed under any condition. The only change was slight discoloration on exposure to light or under the 
severe stressed conditions.  
The  stability  results  indicate  that  the  active  substance  manufactured  by  the  proposed  supplier  is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container.  
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is formulated as immediate release solid dosage form for oral administration using 
compendial excipients. The active substance is dry blended with the excipients and the final blend is 
encapsulated in hard gelatin capsules. 
For the manufacturing of the hard-gelatin capsule, a dry blending process with subsequent encapsulation 
was chosen. The process is rather simple and consists of several sieving and blending steps, followed by 
encapsulation. Sieving was performed with oscillating sieving equipment or with hand-sieve, based on the 
batch size, and blending was performed using a diffusion mixer. For encapsulation, an automatic 
encapsulation machine with dosing disk encapsulation principle was chosen. The encapsulation process 
step comprised also a weight check of all filled capsules after encapsulation. The powder blend showed 
good flowing property during encapsulation.  
The impact of the active substance particle size on finished product processability was investigated, and 
no  impact  was  observed on  the  blending  and  sieving  processes or on  the  blend  uniformity.  However, 
smaller particles affect the bulk volume of the final blend, which makes encapsulation more challenging. 
Based on the experiences from pilot scale encapsulation, a lower particle size limit was proposed. The 
optimised powder blend showed good flowing property during encapsulation. 
The choice of the excipients used in the capsule formulation was based on excipient compatibility studies 
and the functionality of excipients.  Binary and ternary blends of different excipients and active substance 
were prepared and stored for 3 months at 40 °C under humid condition (75% RH) and under dry condition. 
EMA/170114/2015  
Page 18/105 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The excipients selected did not cause an increase in degradation products. They are commonly used for 
solid oral dosage forms and in compliance with pharmacopoeial standards. There are no novel excipients 
used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
Two batches of dry blend containing the selected excipients were prepared for formulation development 
and encapsulated within hard gelatin capsules. The capsules were packaged in high density polyethylene 
(HDPE) bottles and placed on stability. Assay results after 3 months met the acceptance criteria and no 
significant degradation or other changes were observed. The total degradation products remained well 
below the specification limit, which at the beginning of development was the requirement for sum of 
degradation products. This requirement was tightened for the commercial product based on the 
availability of additional data and justification of the finished product specifications. 
The finished product is packaged in PCTFE/PVC blister packs and consists of a PCTFE/PVC film backed with 
a heat sealable lacquered aluminium foil. Based on the available stability data provided, the proposed 
packaging is considered protective and compatible with the hard gelatine capsules. The container closure 
system complies with the new Commission Regulation (EU) No 10/2011 on plastic materials and articles 
intended to come into contact with food. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
A dry blending process with subsequent encapsulation was chosen as manufacturing process. It consists 
of 7 main steps: loading of the active substance and excipients, sieving, blending, sieving and mixing, 
blending,  encapsulation  and  packaging.  The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  standard  manufacturing 
process.  
The robustness of the manufacturing process has been validated at production scale .Process validation 
utilizing  the  intended  commercial  process  was  performed  on  three  consecutive  batches  prior  to 
commercialization. This was considered satisfactory. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form:  
appearance of contents, appearance of shell, identity (UV, HPLC), mean mass of contents, dissolution 
(UV), impurities (HPLC),  microbial enumeration test (Ph  Eur), assay (HPLC)  and uniformity of dosage 
units  (Ph  Eur).  Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  for  nine  batches  used  for  clinical  and/or  stability 
studies confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the 
intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data on 3 batches (2 pilot scale and 1 commercial scale) of finished product stored under long 
term conditions for 9 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH, for up 9 months under intermediate conditions at 30 °C 
/ 75% RH and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. The batches are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in 
the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
EMA/170114/2015

Samples were tested for appearance, appearance of the shell, assay (HPLC), dissolution (UV), and 
impurities (HPLC). The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. The analytical procedures used 
are stability indicating. 
Supportive stability data for clinical and registration batches in HDPE bottles have been included. Data up 
to 6 months are available. In addition supportive data for 2 development clinical batches at lab scale 
packed in HDPE bottles have been submitted. Data up to 24 months and 12 months respectively are 
available. All supportive batches complied with specifications for appearance of capsule contents and 
shells, dissolution rate testing as well as assay and degradation products testing at all time points tested 
to date. Supportive bridging registration stability data up to 6 months in blister have been included for 
blue-white opaque coloured, size ‘00’ capsules, representative to commercial capsule colour. 
A freeze/thaw cycle stability test was performed for one batch. The samples were stored for four complete 
freeze and thaw cycles (one cycle consisted of -20 °C / ambient RH for 6 days, followed by 1 day at 25 °C 
/ 60% RH) for a total of 28 days. After four complete cycles over a total of 28 days all tested quality 
parameters complied with specifications.  
A photostability stability test was performed on one unpacked batch according to the ICH Q1B guideline 
for the ‘Photostability testing of new active substances and medicinal products’. No significant changes or 
trends were observed for all the investigated parameters (assay, individual unspecified and total 
impurities, dissolution and appearance).  
An open dish stability study was conducted for two batches by placing the capsules in an open glass dish 
stored for 0, 1 and 3 months at 25°C / 60% RH and 30°C / 75% RH. Samples were stored for 9 months 
at 25°C / 60% RH and 30°C / 75% RH in PCTFE/PVC blister packs. After this time period, the samples 
were unpacked and capsules were placed in an open glass dish. These samples were stored again at the 
original storage condition (25°C / 60% RH or 30°C / 75% RH) and subsequently tested after 1 and 3 
months. 
In all the stability studies no significant change and no trend were observed for all the investigated 
parameters. No formation or increase in levels of any degradation product was observed. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life with no special storage conditions as stated in the SmPC is 
acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
The gelatin in the capsule shell used in the finished product is of animal (bovine) origin. Current EDQM 
Certificates of Suitability are provided. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Ceretinib is a selective and potent inhibitor of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). ALK is a receptor 
tyrosine kinase that is not normally expressed in the human adult. ALK genetic aberrations involving 
translocation of the kinase domain, gene amplification, or activating mutations occur, creating ALK fusion 
genes with ALK kinase domain fused to partner genes. For NSCLC, ALK aberrations are detected in 
approximately 2% to 8% of the patients. 
Among thirteen fusion partner genes identified to date, NPM is the most common partner in anaplastic 
large-cell lymphoma (ALCL) and echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like4 (EML4) is the main 
partner in NSCLC. The partner genes retain oligomerization domains, leading to ligand-independent 
dimerization or oligomerization, and thus constitutive activation of ALK kinase, which elicits downstream 
signalling pathways that play central roles in cell proliferation, growth and survival. As a consequence, 
NSCLC cells with ALK fusion genes are dependent on or addictive to the ALK fusion genes. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
A number of biochemical, cellular, and in vivo studies have been conducted to characterize ceritinib 
pharmacology activity. 
In vitro studies 
In biochemical assays, ceritinib potently inhibits ALK kinase (IC50 = 0.15 nM). For INSR and IGF-1R, the 
IC50 levels are approximately 50 fold higher than for ALK, AURORA-A, cABL-T315I, and AXL, for which 
IC50s in the range 110-180 nM were determined. For the remaining 30 recombinant kinases tested, the 
selectivity in favour of ALK was at least 2600 fold. 
In cell based assays, ceritinib had an IC50 of 27-35 nM against the fusion kinases EML4-ALK and 
NPM-ALK. The IC50s for IGF-1R, INSR and ROS1 were approximately 5-11 fold higher, while for the rest 
of the 40 kinases in the panel the IC50s were at least 1000 nM. 
When compared to crizotinib in the same panel of recombinant kinases, ceritinib showed 20-fold greater 
potency than crizotinib against ALK kinase (ceritinib IC50=0.15 nM vs. crizotinib IC50= 3 nM) without 
inhibiting MET (ceritinib IC50= 3200 nM vs. crizotinib IC50= 8 nM).  
Ceritinib showed less potency against crizotinib resistant EML4-ALK mutants compared to its 
corresponding activity against the non-mutated EML4-ALK.

The in vitro IC50 assay measurements on the 4 mutated ALKs were conducted in a medium consisting of 
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The unbound fraction of ceritinib in 10% or 100% FBS has not been 
determined. However, a free fraction of 0.029 in 100% FBS was estimated utilizing the mean of unbound 
fractions in rat (fu=0.017), dog (fu= 0.015), monkey (fu = 0.054) and human plasma (fu = 0.028). The 
change in free fraction upon diluting plasma with buffer has been described in the literature (Kalvass 
2002). The experiments conducted by Cyprotex demonstrate that free fraction in diluted plasma is nearly 
proportional to the plasma dilution factor. Using either equation 4 from Kalvass (Figure 1: Equation 4 
(where fu is the fraction unbound and D is the dilution factor) ) or the equation on the Cyprotex website, 
the unbound fraction of ceritinib in 10% FBS may be estimated to be 0.23. 
Figure 1: Equation 4 (where fu is the fraction unbound and D is the dilution factor) 
Applying this estimated fu in 10% FBS to the in vitro assays results in the following unbound IC50 
estimates of ceritinib in the in vitro assays (Table 3):  
Table 3: Ceritinib IC50 
The growth inhibitory effect of ceritinib was examined in a panel of 95 human NSCLC cell lines. Cell 
proliferation and growth were monitored by measuring the amount of ATP in cells after incubation with 
ceritinib. The ALK expression levels were determined in the 95 cell lines by RNA-seq technology as FPKM 
values calculated from RNA-seq data. NSCLC lines that do not harbour ALK rearrangements were not 
sensitive to ceritinib (CP or relative IC50 > 5.0 µM) regardless of their ALK expression level. NCI-H2228, 
the only line with the EML4-ALK translocation (and the highest expression level of ALK), was the most 
sensitive line, with the CP or relative IC50 of 0.8 µM. 
In vivo studies 
In vivo, ceritinib demonstrated a dose-dependent anti-tumour activity in several human tumour models 
expressing EML4-ALK or NPM-ALK. Complete or nearly complete anti-tumour efficacy (tumour 
regression) was observed at oral dose of 25 mg/kg/day in mice and rats. AUC levels were below human 
therapeutic exposure.

Figure 3: Anti-tumour activity of ceritinib  in the NCI-H2228 tumour model in rat (RD-2008-50933) 
Ceritinib was also evaluated in comparison with crizotinib in the mouse xenograft model derived from the 
EML4-ALK-positive NCI-H2228 cell line. Both compounds caused complete tumour regression, but the 
effect of ceritinib appeared to be more sustained than for crizotinib (150 days versus 1-2 weeks, 
respectively). The exposure at the dose required for crizotinib to achieve complete regression (mean 
AUC0-24h 49,059 ng*hr/mL, 100 mg/kg) is approximately 4 times higher than the exposure required for 
ceritinib (mean AUC0-24h 12,507 ng*hr/mL, 25 mg/kg), indicating that ceritinib is a more potent ALK 
inhibitor than crizotinib in vivo. The exposure to ceritinib is considered to be equal to the expected 
therapeutic exposure in patients.  
In several NCI-H2228 xenograft tumour models that developed resistance to crizotinib, ceritinib showed 
strong anti-tumour activity at oral dose of 50 to 100 mg/kg/day. The exposures of ceritinib at these doses 
were in the clinically relevant range, 1.3- to 2.4- fold higher than the exposure observed at 750 mg/day 
in humans. One of these crizotinib-resistant models harboured the same secondary ALK mutation, 
C1156Y, as that identified from crizotinib-resistant patients. Another model did not harbour secondary 
mutations in the ALK kinase domain (or harbours wild type EML4-ALK) but retained the ALK translocation, 
which is similar to what has been observed in some patients who have developed resistance to crizotinib. 
The anti-tumour activity of ceritinib in these crizotinib-resistant models likely results from its inhibition of 
mutant ALK and/or more potent inhibition of wild type ALK. 
EMA/170114/2015  
Page 23/105 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The selectivity of ceritinib was assessed in panels of GPCRs, transporters, ion channels, nuclear receptors, 
and enzymes. Activities were monitored initially at a single concentration of 10 µM in an 84-member 
target panel or by dose-response for a 72-member target panel. 
Ceritinib was further tested in a functional calcium flux cellular assay of Somatostatin Sst2 and Sst4 and 
was found to be inactive up to 10 µM. 
In biochemical assay ceritinib inhibited insulin receptor (INSR) and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor 
(IGF-1R) with IC50 values lower than 55 nM. To assess its selectivity over INSR in vivo, ceritinib was 
evaluated in an oral glucose tolerance test in mice. Animals were dosed once daily with ceritinib at 25, 50, 
or 100 mg/kg for 7 days before the oral glucose tolerance test was conducted under fasting condition. 
Compared with the vehicle, ceritinib did not have a significant effect on glucose levels during the glucose 
tolerance test or on fasting plasma insulin level at all dose levels tested. Notably, these dose levels were 
able to induce 70- 90% inhibition of the ALK pathway and strong anti-tumour activity in treatment-naïve 
and crizotinib-resistant EML4-ALK-positive tumour models.  
HSP90s are a family of chaperone proteins involved in folding and stabilization of a large number of client 
proteins, including EML4-ALK fusion proteins. An HSP90 inhibitor has been shown to induce the 
degradation of EML4-ALK and lead to tumour regression in an EML4-ALK-postive NSCLC model. The 
combination of an ALK kinase inhibitor with an HSP90 inhibitor has the potential to increase anti-tumour 
effects by combining two different mechanisms of targeting ALK fusion proteins. The combination of 
ceritinib with AUY922 (an HSP90 inhibitor) was evaluated in two different primary lung tumour xenograft 
models derived from patient tumour cells: HLUX1787, which harbours the EML4-ALK variant 2, and 
LUF-1656, which harbours the EML4-ALK variant 1. Both studies showed that the combinations improved 
anti-tumour activity compared with the monotherapy.

potassium channel (IC50=0.4 µM, 233 ng/mL). In vivo, ceritinib induced QT prolongation in 1 of 4 
monkeys after receiving the highest dose of ceritinib, 100 mg/kg. No ECG abnormalities were detected in 
a 13-week toxicology study in monkeys at an average exposure (Cmax) up to 1590 and 1860 ng/mL for 
females and males, respectively. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No non-clinical information on possible pharmacodynamic drug interactions has been submitted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Non-clinical pharmacokinetics studies were conducted in rats, mice, monkeys and dogs. 
Absorption and pharmacokinetics 
Ceritinib was slowly absorbed in rats, monkeys and humans with a plasma Tmax between 6-24 h after 
single dose. Oral absorption was moderate in rats and monkeys, 37% and ≥ 40%, respectively. In 
humans, oral absorption was estimated to be ≥ 25%.

bioavailability value of ~ 100 was obtained in fed dogs, suggesting the possible existence of a positive 
food effect. In humans, a positive food effect was also observed for ceritinib when administered under fed 
conditions with a high-fat, high-calorie meal (73% for AUCinf, 72% for AUClast and 41% for Cmax).  
Certinib exposure increased with the dose in an over-proportional manner in all species evaluated (rat, 
monkey and humans). There was no apparent gender difference in the exposure for monkeys and rats. No 
conclusive evidence of accumulation for rats was observed, while monkeys showed moderate 
accumulation (up to 2.7-fold on day 73). In humans accumulation was up to 6.2-fold after 3 weeks of 
once-daily dosing. 
The terminal half-life after intravenous administration of ceritinib was long in the mouse, rat, dog and 
monkey (6.2-29 hours). In humans, the apparent terminal half-life was also long ~ 30-40 hours. 
Plasma clearance of ceritinib following an intravenous dose was moderate in the mouse, rat and dog, 1.60 
L/h/kg, 1.49 L/h/kg and 0.552 L/h/kg, respectively, and low to moderate in the monkey, 0.366-0.78 
L/h/kg. The steady-state volume of distribution of ceritinib was high in the mouse (9.7 L/kg), rat (19.9 
L/kg), dog (13.5 L/kg) and monkey (6.53-13.5 L/kg). 
Distribution 
In vivo, ceritinib was widely distributed with a Tmax occurring at 4 h post-dose in most of the tissues. 
Concentration in tissues was generally higher than blood concentration. Ceritinib was mainly distributed 
to the intestinal wall, uveal tract, pituitary gland, bile, adrenal cortex, harderian gland, liver, spleen, 
lymph node, lung, kidney, thyroid, bone marrow, adrenal medulla, pancreas, thymus and salivary gland. 
EMA/170114/2015  
Page 26/105 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Ceritinib-derived radioactivity was retained in several other tissues (including testis, epididymis, and skin) 
and the elimination was not yet complete by 168 hours post-dose. 
Ceritinib is distributed across the blood-brain barrier, but to a lower degree compared to other tissues and 
organs. It demonstrated a high affinity for melanin-rich tissues (uveal tract). 
The compound distributed more to blood cells than to plasma in all tested species including humans. 
In vitro, ceritinib was highly bound to protein. Mean plasma protein binding over the concentration range 
of 50-10,000 ng/mL was 98.5%, 98.3%, 97,2% and 94.6%  for the dog, rat, human and monkey, 
respectively. 
Ceritinib crosses the placental barrier in animals (rats and rabbits). Maternal ceritinib plasma 
concentrations were approximately 10- to 20-fold higher than the foetal ceritinib plasma concentration. 
Ceritinib should not be used during pregnancy. 
Metabolism 
Biotransformation of ceritinib has been examined in rats and monkeys, the species used for non-clinical 
general toxicity testing. 
In general, metabolism of ceritinib is low across species and the biotransformation reactions observed in 
vitro were mainly the same as those observed in vivo in rats, monkeys and humans. These included 
mono-oxygenation, O-dealkylation, S-dealkylation, and N-formylation of ceritinib, and secondary 
di-oxygenation, glucuronidation, sulfation and dehydrogenation. After a single intravenous or oral dose of 
ceritinib, unchanged ceritinib was the only circulating component in plasma from rats, and the main 
component in plasma from monkeys (84.4%) and humans (81.6%). Eleven metabolites were found in the 
plasma of humans, each at levels ≤ 2.3% of the total drug-related AUC. Five of these eleven metabolites 
were not detected in the plasma of either the rat or monkey. However, two of them (M23.6 and M35.8) 
were observed in the faeces of both species. The remaining three unique human metabolites detected at 
low levels in plasma included M46.6 (1.7%), M48.8 (1.7%), and M52.0 (2%). 
M35.8 was the most abundant metabolite in the faeces of the monkey. M33.4 was also relatively 
abundant in the faeces of both the rat and monkey. In orally dosed humans, the faecal route of excretion 
for ceritinib was also dominant over the urinary route. As with the monkey, the most abundant metabolite 
in human faeces after an oral dose of ceritinib was also M35.8. Of the metabolites found in rat, monkey, 
and human faeces, none were present at mean levels > 8.7% of the administered dose. 
Metabolite profiles in urine were not determined for rat, monkey or human because only a small amount 
of the administered dose was eliminated by this route (<2%).  
No studies on metabolism have been conducted in rabbit. 
Excretion 
The major route of excretion was the faeces in rats, monkeys and humans (approximately 90 to 100% 
after 168 h).

In cannulated rats, excretion was mainly into the faeces (65%) and bile (24.3%).  Urinary excretion was 
1.3 % in humans and ≤3% in animals. 
Studies on the excretion of ceritinib into milk were not conducted. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
In vitro interaction studies with ceritinib were performed in human liver microsomes,hepatocytes and 
other cellular systems. 
Relative contribution of the individual CYP450 enzymes to the hepatic microsomal oxidative metabolism 
of ceritinib was assessed in pre-clinical study R0900839. Hepatic microsomal oxidative metabolism of 
ceritinib was primarily mediated by CYP3A, as selective inhibition of CYP3A by ketoconazole and azamulin 
produced maximum inhibition (>90%) of the metabolite rate formation, while inhibition of other CYPs 
tested produced maximum inhibitions ranging from 10-22%. 
The recombinant human CYP enzymes found capable of metabolizing ceritinib were CYP3A4 and CYP1B1. 
Since CYP1B1 is not endogenously expressed in human liver under normal conditions, CYP3A4 is expected 
to contribute to the majority of hepatic oxidative clearance of ceritinib in humans (R0900839). Thus, due 
to the major involvement of CYP3A4 in the hepatic oxidative metabolic clearance of ceritinib, there is a 
potential for drug-drug interactions with co-medications that are CYP3A inhibitors. 
Further, CYP450 inhibition by ceritinib in human liver microsomes was assessed in pre-clinical study 
R0900796. Ceritinib was found to be a reversible and time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5, with an 
unbound Ki value for reversible inhibition of 0.161 μM, and Ki and kinact values of 1.47 μM and 0.0642 
min-1, respectively, for time-dependent inhibition. In addition to CYP3A4, in vitro inhibition results from 
this study indicated that ceritinib may inhibit the metabolic clearance of co-medications metabolized by 
CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP2E1 in vivo if sufficiently high 
concentrations are achieved. 
Enzyme induction studies in primary human hepatocytes (study R1200856) revealed a dose dependent 
induction of CYP3A4 mRNA with the ceritinib treatment in hepatocytes from the three donor livers used. 
Ceritinib (0.25-2.5 μM) did not result in induction of CYP1A2 or CYP2B6 mRNA/activities (levels were 
<2-fold). Based on these in vitro results, ceritinib is unlikely to be a clinical inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, 
or CYP2C9 in vivo. There is a potential for ceritinib to be an inducer of CYP3A4 in vivo. The relevance of 
these in vitro data to an induction response in vivo is dependent upon the actual dosing regimen and 
exposure of ceritinib clinically. 
Ceritinib was classified as a low passive permeability compound. It is a substrate of the transporter P-gp. 
The uptake of ceritinib was stimulated 1.44 and 1.29-fold in cells stably expressing OAT2 and OATP1B1, 
respectively, but the uptake was minor compared to the uptake of the prototypic substrates of OAT2 
(cGMP). Ceritinib did not appear to be a substrate of OCT1 or OATP2B1. 
EMA/170114/2015  
Page 28/105 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on in vitro data, ceritinib does not inhibit apical efflux transporter MRP2, hepatic uptake 
transporters OATP1B1 or OATP1B3, renal organic anion uptake transporters OAT1 and OAT3, or the 
organic cation uptake transporters OCT1 or OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations. Therefore, clinical 
drug-drug interactions as a result of ceritinib-mediated inhibition of substrates for these transporters are 
unlikely to occur. Based on in vitro data, ceritinib is predicted to inhibit intestinal P-gp and BCRP at 
clinically relevant concentrations.  Studies in vitro showed that the IC50 values of hepatic uptake 
transporters OATP1B1 or OATP1B3 and renal organic anion uptake transporters OAT1 and OAT3 are 
higher than 5 µM. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
A complete toxicity safety evaluation program (acute, subchronic, chronic, reproductive toxicology 
studies and genotoxicity studies) was conducted to support the administration of ceritinib to adult cancer 
patients. The toxicology program was consistent with the ICH S9 Guideline on Nonclinical Evaluation for 
Anticancer Pharmaceuticals as well as all other relevant ICH Guidelines on safety. All toxicology studies 
were performed either in accordance with GLP guidelines or with currently accepted guidelines with 
respect to animal numbers and dose levels. 
Single dose toxicity 
One single rising dose study was conducted with ceritinib in monkeys, while no single dose studies in 
rodents have been performed. The study and main findings are summarised in Table 7.

Ceritinib was given as a 0.5% methyl cellulose (MC) solution to 2 male Cynomolgus monkeys in a single 
rising dose design of 20, 60, 120 and 250 mg/kg on days 1, 6, 12 and 19, respectively.  
Diarrhoea was seen after a dose of 120 mg/kg and diarrhoea and emesis with food after 250 mg/kg. 
There were no changes in haematology parameters. Increased AST (3-5-fold over baseline) and ALT 
(2-fold over baseline) were observed in one animal at the two highest doses. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Subacute, subchronic and chronic toxicity of ceritinib were assessed in oral repeat-dose toxicity studies in 
rats (up to 13 weeks) and cynomolgus monkey (up to 13 weeks). Major findings from the repeat dose 
toxicity studies are presented in Table 8.

The Ames tests were negative and the chromosomal aberration studies gave no indication on structural 
changes. An increased number of cells with numerical aberrations were seen. This was predominantly 
associated with increases in polyploidy cells. The in vitro micronucleus test showed a weakly positive 
effect at moderate cytotoxic levels. However, the in vivo study gave a negative result. Ceritinib is 
considered as being neither mutagenic nor clastogenic in the conducted genotoxicity studies. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were performed which in view of the applied indication is acceptable according 
to the guideline ICH S9 on Non Clinical Evaluation for Anticancer Pharmaceuticals. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
Fertility and early embryonic development studies were not conducted with ceritinib according to ICHS9 
Guideline for the development of oncology drugs. 
In the pivotal embryo-foetal development studies, no signs of foetotoxicity or teratogenicity were 
observed in rats and rabbits. At the embryo-foetal no effect levels, maternal exposures (AUC) in pregnant 
rats and rabbits were 0.65 and 0.49, respectively, of the exposure attained at the clinical dose of 750 mg. 
Though no effects of ceritinib were observed on the developing foetus, at maximum tolerated maternal 
doses the exposure margins are low so caution needs to be applied in extrapolating to potential human 
risk.

Prenatal and postnatal development and juvenile toxicity studies have not been conducted. 
Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance studies were not conducted with ceritinib as the route of administration is oral. 
Other toxicity studies 
Phototoxicity 
The phototoxic potential of ceritinib was evaluated in the 3T3 NRU phototoxicity assay. The resulting 
Photo Irritation Factor values from two assays (8.1 and 5.1) indicated that ceritinib had a slight phototoxic 
potential (PIF>5.0). The in vivo phototoxic potential of ceritinib was also evaluated after oral 
administration to female BALB/c mice. Ceritinib did not have any phototoxic potential at a Cmax that is 
3-fold higher than the Cmax at the clinical maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of 750 mg. According to the 
clinical overview, AEs associated with phototoxicity were reported in only 2.0% of 304 patients in Study 
X2101 and all were grade 1. These AEs had no impact on study treatment (i.e., no cases required drug 
interruption, dose reduction, or discontinuation). 
Studies on impurities 
Limits proposed for impurities 123-13 and 127-13 are above of qualification threshold. These impurities 
have been adequately qualified in the four weeks general toxicity study and in the micronucleus test 
performed in rats.

The octanol/water partition coefficient for ceritinib was determined to be 5.1 at pH=7. Ceritinib log D 
exceeds 4.5. Therefore, PBT screening is required. 
Further, a Ready Biodegradability Test (OECD 301) was conducted and the results show that ceritinib is 
not readily biodegradable. A long-term toxicity test set on fish, daphnia and algae was performed to study 
potential effects on aquatic organisms.  
The potential for adsorption to sewage sludge and soil, as well as partitioning to sediments, will be 
examined in further studies which are ongoing. 
In the context of the obligation of the MAH to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following point to be addressed: 
The Applicant will therefore submit a complete environmental risk assessment including studies to 
address the PBT assessment, adsorption to sewage sludge and soil and transformation in soil and 
aqueous sediment system by Q3 2015. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology and Safety pharmacology 
Ceritinib has been studied extensively in primary, secondary and safety pharmacology studies. Potent 
inhibition  of  ALK  kinase  with  a  high  degree  of  selectivity  has  been  demonstrated  (IC50  =  0.15  nM). 
Compared  to  crizotinib,  which  inhibits  both  ALK,  cABL  and  MET  within  the  same  concentration  range, 
ceritinib appears to be a more selective ALK-inhibitor. However, at the therapeutic maximum dose of 750 
mg/day,  a  maximum  free  plasma  concentration  of  approximately  55  nM  is  expected,  and  a  potential 
effect on some other kinases cannot be excluded. Functional effects on IGF-1R and INSR was not detected 
in  specifically  designed  studies,  but  a  tendency  to  mild  increase  in  plasma  glucose  and  insulin  was 
observed in some general toxicity studies in both rat and monkey. Hyperglycaemia is also listed as an 
identified clinical risk in the Risk Management Plan (RMP). The mechanism inducing hyperglycaemia is 
unknown, however inhibition of the INSR cannot be excluded. For ROS1 no functional data are available. 
Ceritinib was less potent against crizotinib resistant EML4-ALK mutants compared to its activity against 
the  non-mutated  EML4-ALK.  Nonetheless,  ceritinib  showed  strong  activity  against  these  ALK  mutants 
with greater potency than crizotinib. The unbound fraction of ceritinib in the in vitro cellular assay on 
protein kinases and on crizotinib resistant EML4-ALK mutants has not been determined. Based on the 
EMA/170114/2015  
Page 36/105 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
equation from Kalvass (2002) the unbound concentrations of ceritinib in 10% FBS was estimated to be 
0.23. Applying this approximation the estimated unbound IC50 for EML4-ALK C1156Y, EML4-ALK L1196M 
and EML4-ALK are below the therapeutic concentration of ceritinib (55 nM). Clinical efficacy of ceritinib on 
EML4-ALK  L1196M  and  EML4-ALK  has  been  demonstrated.  However,  clinical  data  about  effects  on 
EML4-AL  C1156Y  are  not  available.  Regarding  to  EML4-ALK  G1202R,  the  estimated  unbound  IC50  is 
above the 55 nM and this mutation has been detected in patients who progressed on ceritinib.  
In xenograft tumour models derived from NCI-H2228 (EML4-ALK variant 3) and Karpas299 (NPM-ALK+) 
cells,  ceritinib  induced  a  dose-dependent  tumour  regression  that  was  complete,  or  nearly  complete. 
Interestingly, the effect of ceritinib appeared to be much more sustained than for crizotinib, and a strong 
anti-tumour effect by ceritinib was also observed in  crizotinib-resistant models. However, only one of 
these  crizotinib-resistant  models  harboured  a  secondary  ALK  mutation,  C1156Y,  which  has  been 
identified in crizotinib-resistant patients. Another model did not harbour secondary mutations in the ALK 
kinase domain but retained the ALK translocation. Ceritinib exposure levels that induced complete tumour 
regression  in  these  models  were  equal  to  or  2.4  fold  higher,  than  clinical  exposure,  suggesting  that 
compared to crizotinib naïve subjects, higher doses are necessary to induce tumour regression. This is 
also consistent with results from cell lines expressing ALK mutants, which were less sensitive to ceritinib 
than  the  EML4-ALK  WT.  Although  it  is  plausible  that  a  higher  concentration  of  ceritinib  is  required  to 
inhibit mutant ALK, loss of selectivity and inhibition of kinases different from ALK (e.g. ROS1, AURORA, 
ABL, AXL) could potentially also contribute to the anti tumourigenic effect in these models. 
In the secondary pharmacology studies, a screening for potential effects of ceritinib was conducted in two 
large panels of GPCRs, ion channels, transporters and receptors. For study RD-2008-50904 the Applicant 
states that a dose response has been performed for 9 of 15 targets with more than 50% inhibition at 10 
µM ceritinib. Targets included in the dose-response follow up were the ones where at least 90% inhibition 
at 10 µM ceritinib was detected, pharmacologically related targets, and in addition the 5-HTa receptor 
(71% inhibition in the screening). Otherwise, IC50’s that have been presented are in general in large 
excess of the expected free concentration in patients (55 nM) and most targets with an IC50 > 1 µM have 
been further examined in cellular functional assays. Results have not shown any effects considered to be 
clinically relevant. Overall, data presented in the dossier support a high degree of selectivity for ceritinib 
at therapeutic doses; no obvious secondary non-kinase targets have been identified. 
The  studies  to  evaluate  the  acute  effects  of  ceritinib  on  vital  organ  system  functions  were  conducted 
according to the requirements established in the ICH S7a and S7b guidelines. These studies indicate that 
ceritinib is unlikely to interfere with vital functions of the respiratory and central nervous systems. 
Ceritinib inhibited the hERG current at all tested concentrations, with an estimated IC50 of 0.4 µM (233 
ng/mL). Based on an average Cmax of 1100 ng/mL in humans at the current therapeutic dose of 750 mg 
and that ceritinib is approximately 97.2% bound to plasma proteins, this equates to a maximal free drug 
concentration of 30.8 ng/mL. The difference between maximal free drug concentration in plasma and the 
estimated IC50 value in the hERG-assay is approximately 7 fold.  
In  clinical  studies  with  ceritinib  there  have  been  observations  of  QT/QTc  prolongation  in  18  patients 
(5.9%).  According  to  the  Applicant,  no  patient  discontinued  the  study  drug  due  to  QT  prolongation 
events, nor were there any reported deaths due to treatment-related cardiac events. These findings are 
further discussed in the clinical part of the assessment. The detectable effects on the hERG channel and 
QT interval prolongation warrant caution when using co-medications that carry this risk, or in patients 
that may experience unusually high plasma concentrations or have risk factors for QT prolongation. QT 
prolongation is however listed as an important identified risk in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) and 
information  about  the  non-clinical  findings  is  adequately  presented  in  the  SPC.  Further  non-clinical 
studies are not considered necessary. 
EMA/170114/2015  
Page 37/105 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Pharmacokinetics 
ADME-studies were conducted in rat and monkey, the species used for general toxicity testing. 
Three unique human metabolites have been detected, namely M46.6 (1.7%), M48.8 (1.7%), and M52.0 
(2%). Considering the low levels of these human metabolites, and the fact that ceritinib is a product under 
the scope of ICH S9, no further qualification of human metabolites is considered warranted. 
No PK-studies have been conducted in rabbit, one of the species used for reproductive toxicity testing. 
However,  biotransformation  reactions  appear  similar  and  occur  only  to  a  limited  extent  across  tested 
species (rat, monkey and human). In view of this, and with reference to ICH S9, metabolic profiling for 
ceritinib in rabbit is not considered necessary. 
No  data  on  excretion  in  milk  are  available.  Since  ceritinib  is  not  intended  to  be  used  in  pregnant  or 
lactating women, this is considered acceptable. Adequate information and warning has been included in 
section 4.6 of the SPC. 
PK interaction 
Ceritinib at clinically relevant concentration will likely inhibit the in vivo clearance of drugs metabolized by 
CYP2A6, CYP2C9, CYP3A (reversible and time-dependent), and CYP2E1 but not CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
CYP2C19, and CYP2D6. Additionally, ceritinib can inhibit CYP3A4. This effect will likely be masked by the 
time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A. The apparent passive permeability of ceritinib was determined to be 
low indicating that ceritinib efflux is through transporters. It was showed that ceritinib is a substrate of 
P-gp but not of OAT1, OAT2, OATP1B1 and OATP2B1. It is unlikely that ceritinib administered at dose of 
750 mg once-day will alter the pharmacokinetics of co-medications that are substrates for any of the 
following transporters, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3 and OCT2. 
Since ceritinib is predicted to inhibit intestinal P gp and BCRP at clinically relevant concentrations, it may 
have the potential to increase plasma concentrations of co administered medicinal products transported 
by these proteins.  
Toxicology 
A complete toxicity safety evaluation program (acute, subchronic, chronic and reproductive toxicology 
studies and genotoxicity studies) was conducted to support the administration of ceritinib to adult cancer 
patients. The toxicology program was consistent with the ICH S9 Guideline on Nonclinical Evaluation for 
Anticancer Pharmaceuticals as well as all other relevant ICH Guidelines on safety. All toxicology studies 
were  performed  either  in  accordance  with  GLP  guidelines  or  with  currently  accepted  guidelines  with 
respect to animal numbers and dose levels.  
The principal toxicity related to ceritinib administration in rats and monkeys was inflammation of the extra 
hepatic  bile  ducts  accompanied  by  increased  neutrophil  counts  in  the  peripheral  blood.  Mixed 
cell/neutrophilic inflammation of the extra hepatic ducts extended to the pancreas and/or duodenum at 
higher doses. Gastrointestinal toxicity was observed in both species characterised by body weight loss, 
decreased  food  consumption,  emesis  (monkey),  diarrhoea  and,  at  high  doses,  by  histopathological 
lesions  including  erosion,  mucosal  inflammation  and  foamy  macrophages  in  the  duodenal  crypts  and 
submucosa.  Liver  was  also  affected  in  both  species,  but  only  at  the  highest  dose  levels  studied,  and 
included minimal increases in liver transaminases in a few animals and vacuolation of the intra hepatic 
bile duct epithelium. Alveolar foamy macrophages (confirmed phospholipidosis) were seen in the lungs of 
rats, but not in monkeys, and the lymph nodes of rats and monkeys had macrophage aggregates. Target 
organ effects showed partial to complete recovery. Effects on the thyroid were observed in both rat (mild 
increases in thyroid stimulating hormone and triiodothyronine / thyroxine T3/T4 concentrations with no 
EMA/170114/2015  
Page 38/105 
 
 
  
 
 
 
microscopic correlate) and monkey (depletion of colloid in males in 4 week study, and one monkey at high 
dose with diffuse follicular cell hyperplasia and increased thyroid stimulating hormone in 13 week study). 
As these non-clinical effects were mild, variable and inconsistent, the relationship between ceritinib and 
thyroid gland changes in animals is unclear. 
The micronucleus test in TK6 cells was positive. No signs of mutagenicity or clastogenicity were observed 
in other in vitro and in vivo genotoxicity studies with ceritinib. Therefore, genotoxic risk is not expected in 
humans. 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with ceritinib, which is considered acceptable according 
to ICH S9. 
No  fertility,  early  embryonic  development,  pre-/postnatal  or  juvenile  toxicology  studies  have  been 
conducted.  This  is  in  line  with  guidelines  for  pharmaceuticals  intended  for  treatment  of  patients  with 
advanced cancer. The potential for ceritinib to cause infertility in male and female patients is therefore 
unknown. 
Reproductive toxicology studies (i.e. embryo foetal development studies) in pregnant rats and rabbits 
indicated  no  foetotoxicity or  teratogenicity  after  dosing  with  ceritinib  during  organogenesis;  however, 
maternal plasma exposure was less than that observed at the recommended dose of 750 mg in clinical 
trials.  The  potential  risk  in  humans  is  unknown.  Women  of  childbearing  potential  should  therefore  be 
advised to use a highly effective method of contraception while taking ceritinib and for up to 3 months 
after discontinuing treatment (see sections 4.5 and 4.6 of the SmPC).  
Ceritinib showed a low potential for phototoxicity in the 3T3 NRU in vitro assay and was confirmed to be 
non-phototoxic in the UV mouse LLNA. 
An environmental risk assessment (ERA) has been submitted but the available data are not sufficient to 
conclude on the environmental risk of ceritinib. The Applicant will therefore submit a complete 
environmental risk assessment including studies to address the PBT assessment, adsorption to sewage 
sludge and soil and transformation in soil and aqueous sediment system by Q3 2015. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, and toxicological profile of ceritinib is well characterized. Data from 
Pharmacodynamic studies suggest that ceritinib has an effect on both tumour cell growth and 
proliferation.  
Modest QT prolongation has been observed in safety pharmacology studies. 
The toxicology program was consistent with the ICH S9 Guideline and the principal toxicity identified was 
inflammation of the extra hepatic bile ducts and gastrointestinal toxicity.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK characteristics of ceritinib have mainly been investigated in four studies in healthy subjects 
(A2101, A2104, A2105, A2106) and two clinical studies in patients (X1101 and X2101). There is an 
ongoing study in hepatic impaired subjects. 
Absorption 
Peak plasma levels (Cmax) of ceritinib are achieved approximately 4 to 6 hours after oral administration in 
patients, and approximately 6 to 8 h in healthy subjects.   
In study A2105, following administration of single oral dose of 750 mg [14C] ceritinib, median maximum 
plasma concentrations were reached after 8 hr with mean Cmax of 228 ng/mL and AUC0-∞ of 11300 
(ng*h/mL)/mg. Oral absorption was estimated to be ≥25% based on metabolite percentages in the 
faeces. The absolute bioavailability of ceritinib has not been determined. 
EMA/170114/2015  
Page 41/105 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
The slow absorption of ceritinib was further confirmed in drug-interaction studies A2104 and A2106 
In  study  X2101,  Cmax  and  AUClast  increased  dose-proportionally  across  the  50-750  mg  dose  range 
following  a  single  oral  dose;  however,  pre-dose  Ctrough  appeared  to  increase  with  dose  in  a  greater 
than-proportional  manner  following  multiple  daily  doses  at  steady-state.  Overall,  the  inter-patient 
variability in exposure parameter estimates was high, with coefficients of variation of 93% and 87% for 
AUClast and Cmax, respectively.  
Following dosing at the recommended dose of 750 mg daily, steady-state conditions were achieved by 
approximately 15 days, with geometric mean accumulation (assessed by AUCtau) of 4.7-fold after 1 week 
and 6.2-fold after 3 weeks: exposure stayed relatively stable over the 12-week treatment period. 
Ceritinib demonstrated nonlinear PK over time, as indicated by the observed difference in apparent 
clearance (CL/F) between single-dose administration (88.5 L/h at 750 mg) and at steady-state (33.2 L/h 
at 750 mg). 
Influence of food on drug exposure 
Results from the food effect study A2101 in healthy volunteers showed that the bioavailability of ceritinib 
is increased when given with a meal. Ceritinib AUCinf values were approximately 58% and 73% higher 
(Cmax approximately 43% and 41% higher) when administered with a low fat meal and a high fat meal, 
respectively. No food should be eaten for at least 2 hours before, and for 2 hours after the dose of ceritinib 
is taken.

(Study A2101-PAS) 
Distribution 
The geometric mean apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) ranged from 1990 to 6230 L across the 400 
to 750 mg dose groups [Study X2101], suggesting that ceritinib is extensively distributed. The fraction of 
ceritinib bound to human plasma proteins in vitro is approximately 97% and is independent of 
EMA/170114/2015  
Page 42/105 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
concentration from 50 ng/mL to 10,000 ng/mL. Ceritinib also has a slight preferential distribution to red 
blood cells, relative to plasma, with a mean in vitro blood-to-plasma concentration ratio of 1.35.  
In rats, ceritinib crosses the intact blood brain barrier with a brain-to-blood exposure (AUCinf) ratio of 
about 15%. There are no data related to brain-to-blood exposure ratio in humans. 
Metabolism 
Hepatic microsomal oxidative metabolism of ceritinib is primarily mediated by CYP3A, based on vitro drug 
metabolism studies. In humans, the main biotransformation pathways of ceritinib included 
mono-oxygenation, O-dealkylation, and N-formylation. Secondary biotransformation pathways involving 
the primary biotransformation products included glucuronidation, dehydrogenation and the addition of a 
thiol group to O-dealkylated ceritinib. Unchanged ceritinib was the most abundant drug-related chemical 
species found in both the plasma and excreta. On average, 82% of the circulating radioactivity in plasma 
was attributable to ceritinib. A total of eleven metabolites were found circulating in plasma at low levels 
(mean contribution to the radioactivity AUC ≤ 2.3% for each metabolite). Additionally, no single 
metabolite contributed >5.8% to the plasma radioactivity AUC of any individual subject in the study. 
Figure 4: Biotransformation scheme for ceritinib in humans 
Elimination 
Following single oral doses of ceritinib, the geometric mean apparent plasma terminal half-life (T½) 
ranged from 31 to 41 h across doses of 400 to 750 mg in patients, and 36 to 48 h across doses of 450 to 
750 mg in healthy subjects. Consistent with preclinical studies in rats [Study R0900773a] and monkeys 
[Study R1200422], the majority of the radioactivity dose in humans was eliminated in the faeces (mean: 
91.0%) with only a minor amount eliminated in the urine (mean: 1.3%) following a single oral dose of 750 
mg of [14C]ceritinib to healthy male subjects [Study A2105]. The mean percentage of the dose 
eliminated in the feces as unchanged ceritinib was 68.0% while all the metabolites were present at low 
levels, with no individual metabolite contributing greater than 2.3% to the radioactivity AUC. Hepatic 
metabolism and potentially biliary excretion and gastrointestinal secretion all contribute to ceritinib 
elimination in humans while the kidney appears to play a negligible role. 
Special populations 
EMA/170114/2015  
Page 43/105 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
No dedicated pharmacokinetic study has been conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of 97 patients with mild renal impairment (CLcr 60 to 
<90 ml/min), 22 patients with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to <60 ml/min) and 183 patients with 
normal renal function (≥90 ml/min), ceritinib exposures were similar in patients with mild and moderate 
renal impairment and normal renal function. Patients with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 ml/min) 
were not included in the clinical studies of ceritinib. 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of 48 patients with mild hepatic impairment (total 
bilirubin ≤ULN and AST >ULN or total bilirubin >1.0 to 1.5 times ULN and any AST) and 254 patients with 
normal hepatic function (total bilirubin ≤ULN and AST ≤ULN), ceritinib exposures were similar in patients 
with mild hepatic impairment and normal hepatic function. The pharmacokinetics of ceritinib have not 
been studied in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment. 
No formal studies were conducted to examine the effects of gender, race, weight or age on the PK of 
ceritinib.  In  the  population  PK  model,  gender  had  no  statistically  significant  effect  on  the  systemic 
exposures of ceritinib. The population PK model predicted that the steady-state AUCtau in females (32351 
ng*h/mL) was 14% higher than that in males (28425 ng*h/mL). This magnitude of increase is unlikely to 
be clinically meaningful.  
The final population PK model predicted that Asian patients had approximately 10% higher steady-state 
exposures (AUCtau, Cmax and Cmin) than non-Asian patients. 
Among the patients included in the population PK analysis, 207 patients were non-Asians (Caucasian, 
Black,  and  other)  and  95  patients  were  Asians.  Race  and  body  weight  effects  were  simultaneously 
evaluated along with other covariates of interest. 
Race had no statistically significant effect on CL/F of ceritinib, and it was suggested that the slightly higher 
exposure estimated in Asian patients was likely explained by the lower body weight observed in Asians 
(mean ± SD: 61.3 ± 10.4 kg) than non-Asians (mean ± SD: 72.3 ± 16.4 kg). The current analysis results 
suggest the use of the same dosing regimen (750 mg qd) in Asian and non-Asian patients. 
Weight was found to have a significant effect on the PK of ceritinib in the PopPK analysis. Exposure of 
ceritinib decreased with increasing body weight. Relative to the group of patients of 60-80 kg, the AUCô,ss 
predicted by the PopPK model increased by 20% for a patient below 60 kg, and decreased by 18% for a 
patient over 80-kg. No dose adjustment from the recommended 750 mg qd dose is required on the basis 
of body weight. 
A dedicated pharmacokinetic study in elderly patients has not been conducted. 
No  significant  difference  in  the  predicted  steady-state  exposure  of  ceritinib  was  observed  between 
patients aged ≥ 65 years and aged < 65 years. Hence, no dose adjustment is required on the basis of age. 
However, there are limited PK data in patients >75 years and no data in patients over 85 years of age (see 
section 4.2 of the SmPC). 
No studies investigating PK of ceritinib in paediatric populations have been conducted. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In vitro studies demonstrated that CYP3A was the major enzyme involved in the metabolic clearance of 
ceritinib. 
Effect of other medicinal products on ceritinib pharmacokinetics  
CYP3A/P-gp inhibitors

In healthy subjects, co-administration of a single 450 mg ceritinib dose with ketoconazole (200 mg twice 
daily for 14 days), a strong CYP3A/P-gp inhibitor, resulted in 2.9-fold and 1.2-fold increase in ceritinib 
AUCinf and Cmax, respectively, compared to when ceritinib was given alone (study A2104). The steady-state 
AUC of ceritinib at reduced doses after co-administration with ketoconazole 200 mg twice daily for 14 days 
was predicted by simulations to be similar to the steady-state AUC of ceritinib alone.  
Table 12: Summary statistics of LDK378 pharmacokinetic parameters in healthy subjects when LDK378 
was administered alone or co-administered with ketoconazole (Study A2104–PAS) 
CYP3A inducers 
In healthy subjects, co-administration of a single 750 mg ceritinib dose with rifampicin (600 mg daily for 
14 days), a strong CYP3A/P-gp inducer, resulted in 70% and 44% decreases in ceritinib AUCinf and Cmax, 
respectively, compared to when ceritinib was given alone (study A2106).

rifampin treatment (Study A2106 – PAS)

pH-elevating agents 
A dedicated study to evaluate the effect of gastric acid-reducing agents on the bioavailability of ceritinib 
has not been conducted. Gastric acid-reducing agents (e.g. proton pump inhibitors, H2-receptor 
antagonists, antacids) may alter the solubility of ceritinib and reduce its bioavailability as ceritinib 
demonstrates pH-dependent solubility and becomes poorly soluble as pH increases in vitro. 
Hepatic Transporters 
Ceritinib was found to be a substrate of the hepatic efflux transporter P-gp but was found not to be a 
substrate of the major hepatic uptake transporters organic cation transporter (OCT1), organic anion 
transporter (OAT2), OATP1B1, or OATP2B1 [Study R1000083] or the hepatic efflux transporters 
multidrug resistance protein (MRP2) or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) [Study R1000482]. 
Effect of ceritinib on the pharmacokinetics of other medicinal products 
Based on in vitro data, ceritinib competitively inhibits the metabolism of a CYP3A substrate, midazolam, 
and a CYP2C9 substrate, diclofenac.  
Table 14: Reversible inhibition of cytochrome P450 enzymes by ceritinib tested in human liver 
microsomes 
Time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A was also observed. The steady-state Cmax value of ceritinib at the 
recommended clinical dose of 750 mg daily may exceed the Ki values for CYP3A and CYP2C9, suggesting 
that ceritinib could inhibit the clearance of other medicinal products metabolised by these enzymes at 
clinically relevant concentrations.  
Based on in vitro data, ceritinib also inhibits CYP2A6 and CYP2E1 at clinically relevant concentrations. 
Therefore, ceritinib may have the potential to increase plasma concentrations of co-administered 
medicinal products that are predominantly metabolised by these enzymes. 
In vitro data suggest that ceritinib might induce CYPs regulated by PXR, as indicated in vitro by one 
marker enzyme for PXR induction, CYP3A4. 
EMA/170114/2015  
Page 46/105 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Based on in vitro data, ceritinib does not inhibit apical efflux transporters MRP2, hepatic uptake 
transporters OATP1B1 or OATP1B3, renal organic anion uptake transporters OAT1 and OAT3, or the 
organic cation uptake transporters OCT1 or OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations. Therefore, clinical 
drug-drug interactions as a result of ceritinib-mediated inhibition of substrates for these transporters are 
unlikely to occur. Based on in vitro data, ceritinib is predicted to inhibit intestinal P-gp and BCRP at 
clinically relevant concentrations.  
2.4.3.   Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
See non-clinical aspects. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
No dedicated pharmacodynamics study has been conducted; however relationship between plasma 
concentration and effect has been investigated within study X2101.  
Exposure-response relationship 
The relationship between steady-state exposure of LDK378, as assessed by average Ctrough,ss, and BOR of 
confirmed PR/CR by investigator assessment, was investigated in all ALK-positive NSCLC patients in the 
Efficacy Analysis Set (EAS) with an available average Ctrough,ss. Patients were grouped by quartiles of 
average Ctrough,ss and the proportion of patients with response (BOR of confirmed CR/PR by investigator 
assessment) was presented separately for each quartile range. The average Ctrough,ss quartile ranges and 
the corresponding frequency and proportion of patients with response are shown in Table 15. The result 
of logistic regression analysis, after adjusting for other covariates, showed a trend for an increase of 
response rate with exposure. With a 200 ng/mL (approximately the increase in C trough,ss from 600 mg qd 
to 750 mg qd ) increase in LDK378 average Ctrough,ss, the estimated odds ratio of having a BOR of 
confirmed PR/CR is 1.13 (95% CI: 0.96, 1.34), in the presence of other covariates.

Figure 5: Logistic regression of tumour response status (confirmed CR/PR by investigator assessment) 
versus average C trough,ss , overlaid with observed data 
The potential for QT interval prolongation of ceritinib was assessed in four clinical studies with Zykadia. 
Serial ECGs were collected following a single dose and at steady-state to evaluate the effect of ceritinib on 
the QT interval. A central analysis of ECG data demonstrated new QTc >500 msec in one patient (0.2%). 
There were 23 patients (4.4%) with a QTc increase from baseline >60 msec.  
Data from Study X2101 was also used to characterise the exposure-QTc response for ceritinib based on 
concentration-ECG time-matched data available for patients from a wide dose range (50 to 750 mg dose 
of ceritinib). The analysis of these data showed that increased exposure of ceritinib is associated with 
increased QTc changes from baseline; at median steady-state Cmax the upper bound of the 90% CI for 
mean QTc change from baseline was < 20 ms regardless of the heart rate correction used.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
No apparent differences in the PK of ceritinib were observed between healthy volunteers and patients. 
Observations made in healthy volunteers receiving ceritinib monotherapy are therefore considered to be 
transferrable to the target population. 
Ceritinib demonstrated non-linear PK in patients over time with lower apparent clearance at steady state 
after daily oral dosing at MTD of 750 mg than after a single oral dose. Highest dose investigated in the 
dose-escalation study was 750 mg; thus PK above this dose is not known. The bioavailability of ceritinib 
was increased when given with a meal depending on the fat content. 
Ceritinib is extensively distributed and the fraction bound to human plasma proteins in vitro is 
approximately 97%. 
As ceritinib is eliminated primarily by the liver, hepatic impairment is likely to increase the systemic 
exposure of ceritinib. However, the extent of increase is not anticipated to be substantial, as ceritinib is 
not extensively metabolized based on results from human ADME study. Based on the results of a 
population pharmacokinetic analysis, dose adjustment is not recommended for patients with mild hepatic 
impairment.  
A study in subjects with varying degrees of hepatic impairment (mild, moderate, severe, based on 
Child-Pugh classification) and matched subjects with normal hepatic function is ongoing (Study A2110) 
and the CSR will be submitted by June 2016. Until these data are available, a precautionary statement 
recommending not using ceritinib in patients with moderate-severe hepatic impairment has been 
included in sections 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC. 
As ceritinib is minimally eliminated by the kidney (1.3% of a single oral administered dose) no studies 
have been carried out in impaired renal patients. However, taking into account both, the population PK 
analysis and the mass balance study, no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild to moderate 
renal impairment (see section 4.2 and 5.2 of the SmPC). Patients with severe renal impairment patients 
were excluded from clinical studies and therefore no data have been collected and caution should be used 
in this population.  
In vivo and in vitro data have shown that the concomitant use of CYP3A/P-gp inhibitors can increase the 
ceritinib plasma concentrations.  As a consequence, if it is not possible to avoid concomitant use 
with strong CYP3A inhibitors (including, but not limited to, ritonavir, saquinavir, telithromycin, 
ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, posaconazole and nefazodone), reduce the ceritinib dose by 
approximately one third, rounded to the nearest multiple of the 150 mg dosage strength. After 
discontinuation of a strong CYP3A inhibitor, resume the ceritinib dose that was taken prior to initiating the 
strong CYP3A inhibitor (see section 4.5 of the SmPC). Patients should also be instructed to avoid 
grapefruit and grapefruit juice as they may inhibit CYP3A in the gut wall and may increase the 
bioavailability of ceritinib. 
Results from a DDI study with rifampin clearly indicate that co-administration of ceritinib with strong 
CYP3A/P-gp inducers decreases ceritinib plasma concentrations. Concomitant use of strong CYP3A 
inducers should therefore be avoided; this includes, but is not limited to, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, 
phenytoin, rifabutin, rifampicin and St. John’s Wort (Hypericum perforatum). Caution should be exercised 
with concomitant use of P-gp inducers (see section 4.5 of the SmPC).  
Gastric acid-reducing agents (H2-blockers/proton pump inhibitors) may alter the solubility of ceritinib and 
reduce its bioavailability. In order to investigate the interaction with pH-elevating agents, the applicant 
EMA/170114/2015  
Page 49/105 
 
 
  
 
 
 
will conduct a post-approval study with esomeprazole and submit the results by March 2016 (see RMP). 
In the meantime, the potential for interaction has been reflected in the SmPC (see section 4.5). 
Ceritinib was found to be a reversible and time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 in vitro, but it also has a 
potential to be an inducer of CYP3A4 in vivo. Due to the concomitant time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A 
and the observed decrease in apparent clearance (CL/F) of ceritinib after multiple dosing relative to a 
single dose [Study X2101], it is unlikely that ceritinib would act as a CYP3A inducer clinically. In addition, 
time–dependent inhibition of other major CYPs was evaluated in another study. 
In another study (data not shown) ceritinib showed no apparent time-dependent inhibition of CYP2B6, 
CYP2C8, or CYP2C19 at concentrations of up to 50 μM. It was also shown that ceritinib competitively 
inhibits the metabolism of a CYP2C9 substrate. In order to ensure characterization of the maximal 
ceritinib-mediated inhibition of CYP3A4 and CYP2C9, the applicant will submit the results of a study with 
warfarin(CYP2C9 substrate) and midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate) administered as a two- drug cocktail in 
patients with ALK-positive advanced tumours including NSCLC by September 2018 (see RMP). 
Dose  reduction  may  be  needed  for  co-administered  medicinal  products  that  are  predominantly 
metabolised by CYP3A and CYP2C9. Co-administration of ceritinib with CYP3A substrates known to have 
narrow  therapeutic  indices  (e.g.  astemizole,  cisapride,  ciclosporin,  ergotamine,  fentanyl,  pimozide, 
quinidine, tacrolimus, alfentanil and sirolimus) and CYP2C9 substrates known to have narrow therapeutic 
indices (e.g. phenytoin and warfarin) should be avoided. However, for other PXR-regulated enzymes and 
transporters  (including  UGTs)  the  net  effect  may  be  induction.  In  particular,  there  may  be  a  risk  for 
reduced efficacy of hormonal contraceptives (see section 4.5 of the SmPC).  
In vitro data also showed that ceritinib inhibits CYP2A6 and CYP2E1. Therefore, ceritinib may have the 
potential to increase plasma concentrations of co administered medicinal products that are predominantly 
metabolised by these enzymes. Caution should therefore be exercised with concomitant use of CYP2A6 
and CYP2E1 substrates and ADRs carefully monitored. 
Based on in vitro data, ceritinib is a substrate of the efflux transporter P-glycoprotein (P-gp). If ceritinib 
is administered with medicinal products that inhibit P-gp, an increase in ceritinib concentration is likely. 
Caution should be exercised with concomitant use of P-gp inhibitors and ADRs carefully monitored (see 
section 4.5).  
Because of the potential for ceritinib to inhibit intestinal P-gp and BCRP at clinically relevant 
concentrations, there could be a potential increase of the plasma concentrations of co administered 
medicinal products transported by these proteins. Caution should be exercised with concomitant use of 
BCRP substrates (e.g. rosuvastatin, topotecan, sulfasalazine) and P gp substrates (digoxin, dabigatran, 
colchicine, pravastatin) and ADRs carefully monitored (see section 4.5 of the SmPC). 
Molecular profiling of patient samples both at the gene and protein levels are important to further explore 
deviations and/or explanations at molecular levels in relation with ceritinib therapy. The applicant is 
therefore recommended to submit yearly updates on the biomarker program. 
The identification of which chimeric fusion protein/proteins (result of the chromosomal rearrangements of 
the ALK gene) present in a tumour may be important for predicting responders, as there is a possibility 
that ceritinib may not be equally sensitive to all chimeric proteins. The response to ceritinib may be 
depending on which fusions are present, in addition to other ALK-independent mechanisms (eg. in NSCLC 
the predominant fusion partner with the ALK-kinase domain is the EML4 gene). Thirteen variants of the 
EML4-ALK chimeric protein has so far been identified, several possibly being functional kinases. The 
biomarker program described above would provide useful information to address this issue. 
EMA/170114/2015  
Page 50/105 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The specificity and performance of the pivotal FISH test were discussed during the procedure. This is a 
critical test and a proper selection of patients for treatment with ceritinib is dependent on its validity. The 
FISH test is based on two selected probes to detect rearrangements in the ALK gene. It is a qualitative 
assay, and is designed to detect only the break-up of the ALK gene, and not to identify the nature of the 
fusion partners.  
Information and descriptions for different alternatives to determine ALK arrangements, like the RT-PCR, 
immunohistochemical (IHC) assays, direct sequencing, were adequately provided by the Applicant. The 
choice of the validated and standardised IHC was also adequately justified. 
In the initial submission, twenty-eight of the patients enrolled in study 2101 appeared with no response 
neither on crizotinib nor ceritinib (non- responders on ALK-TKIs), and it was questioned whether these 
patients could have been false positives. The Applicant suggested that other mechanisms could contribute 
to explain the lack of effectiveness of these ALK receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (eg. additional 
oncogenic driver mutations (in the EGFR gene) or other types of resistance (like epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition); even if the tumour is determined positive in ALK gene rearrangement by the validated FISH 
assay .Investigations of tumour biopsies from patients both at the gene and protein levels are important 
to be able to predict response to ceritinib. A biomarker plan will be conducted by the Applicant. 
Ceritinib is claimed to have both a higher potency and to be more specific than crizotinib and has been 
shown to have significant activity in crizotinib-resistant patients. In a recent paper, it is observed that 
ceritinib may supress resistance mutations promoted by crizotinib in vivo, and that rarer mutations may 
be selected by treatment with ceritinib (Friboulet et al., 2014). More knowledge about the resistance 
mechanisms for ceritinib seems important for making treatment decisions.  
The applicant presented results from study A2203, which indicated that percent positive cells above the 
15% cut-off seemingly are not a determinant for response.  
Dose investigations presented for ceritinib were limited by few patients. A proper titration according to 
DLTs was not performed, and results from dose-efficacy analyses were not submitted. Preliminary 
statistical exposure-response analyses suggest only a trend regarding a relationship between higher 
steady-state exposure of ceritinib and higher ORR. However, a rather clear relationship is indicated 
between exposure of ceritinib and increases in more serious adverse events (elevation of transaminases, 
hyperglycemia, QT/QTc- prolongation).  
A pharmacokinetic analysis suggested that ceritinib causes concentration dependent increases in QTc. 
Therefore, ceritinib should be used with caution in patients who have or may develop prolongation of the 
QT interval, including those patients taking anti arrhythmic medicinal products such as class I (e.g. 
quinidine, procainamide, disopyramide) or class III (e.g. amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide) anti 
arrhythmics or other medicinal products that may lead to QT prolongation such as astemizole, 
domperidone, droperidol, chloroquine, halofantrine, clarithromycin, haloperidol, methadone, cisapride 
and moxifloxacin. Monitoring of the QT interval is indicated in the event of combinations of such medicinal 
products. The important risk related to QT interval prolongation has been reflected in sections 4.2, 4.4, 
4.5, 4.8, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetic data in support of the approval of ceritinib sufficiently supports the approval in the 
final indication. The Applicant will conduct a number of post-authorisation measures (PAMs) to further 
clarify the PK/PD profile: 
- In order to evaluate the PK of ceritinib in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to subjects with 
EMA/170114/2015

normal hepatic function, the applicant will conduct and submit the results of a single dose study by 30 
June 2016; 
- In order to assess the effect of ceritinib on the PK of warfarin and midazolam administered as a two- 
drug cocktail in patients with ALK-positive advanced tumours, the applicant will conduct and submit the 
results of a DDI study; 
- In order to assess the effect of esomeprazole (proton pump inhibitor) on the PK of ceritinib in healthy 
volunteers, the applicant will conduct and submit the results of a single dose DDI study. 
In addition, the applicant is recommended to develop a biomarker program to further explore deviations 
and/or explanations at molecular levels in relation with ceritinib therapy.  
Awaiting data from the planned studies, the lack of information has been reflected in the SmPC. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Study X2101 
Determination of MTD has been conducted as part of registration study X2101. This study was originally 
designed as a phase I dose escalation trial for the definition of the MTD.  It was a first-in-human, 
open-label, Phase I study that comprised a dose-escalation phase (to determine the MTD and 
recommended dose [RD]), and an expansion phase to characterize the efficacy, safety and 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of ceritinib. 
Dose-escalation 
The dose-escalation phase included a 3-day single dose PK run-in and the 750mg OD dose was selected 
for further testing into the following period of daily dosing in continuous 21-day treatment cycles. Patients 
could continue treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients treated at the RD 
during the dose-escalation phase and who met the criteria for one of the four expansion arms were 
considered to be included in the appropriate expansion arm.  
The MTD/RD was determined based on the BLRM model assessing the probability of DLTs in Cycle 1 and 
the clinical assessment of safety and efficacy data. 
EMA/170114/2015  
Page 52/105 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
In the dose-escalation phase, 59 patients were treated in 15 cohorts across nine different dose levels (50 
mg to 750 mg), and 54 patients were included in the Dose Determining Set (DDS). 
At the time that the MTD was determined, eight DLTs had occurred during the first cycle of treatment in 
six patients (Table 11-13).  
• At 400 mg: grade 3 hypophosphatemia in one patient, and grade 3 transaminase increased evolving 
from grade 2 ALT increased in one patient.  
• At 600 mg: grade 3 diarrhoea and grade 3 dehydration,  in one patient each.   
• At 750 mg: grade 3 diarrhoea with grade 3 vomiting in one patient and intolerable grade 2 diarrhoea in 
one patient. 
Additional support to establish MTD/RD at 750 mg came from the experience of the first 10 patients in the 
expansion phase (no DLTs were observed) and the preliminary data on tumour activity, which had shown 
tumour response with doses >400mg. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
A phase I, multicentre, open-label, dose-escalation study of LDK378, administered orally in 
adult patients with tumours characterized by genetic abnormalities in anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK) 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Main inclusion criteria: 
1. Patients diagnosed with a locally advanced or metastatic malignancy that has progressed despite

characterized by genetic abnormalities in ALK were enrolled. An ALK translocation must be detected by

Treatments 
Treatment allocated 
Once the MTD/RD was established in the dose-escalation phase, all patients enrolled in the expansion 
phase of the study were treated at that dose (750mg).  
LDK378  was  administered  continuously,  orally  every  day  and  it  was  taken  with  a  glass  of  water  and 
consumed over a short period of time (e.g. 1 capsule every 2 minutes). Each daily dose of LDK378 was 
taken at least 2 hours after the last meal and patients could not eat for at least 2 hours after LDK378 was 
taken.  
EMA/170114/2015  
Page 55/105 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Duration /Discontinuation 
In  both  the  dose-escalation  and  expansion  phases  patients  were  treated  with  LDK378  until  they 
experienced  unacceptable  toxicity  that  precluded  any  further  treatment,  disease  progression,  and/or 
treatment was discontinued at the discretion of the Investigator or by patient request. Patients could also 
continue treatment with LDK378 after disease progression if in the opinion of the Investigator the patients 
were still experiencing clinical benefit. 
Dose reductions/Interruptions 
Dose adjustments were permitted for patients who experienced a DLT with LDK378, if it was considered 
in the best interest of the patient to continue therapy. If a patient experienced a DLT, the Investigators 
were generally advised to interrupt treatment with LDK378 until the event resolved to grade 1 or the 
patient’s baseline, and if continued treatment was considered to be in the best interest of the patient, to 
resume LDK378 at one dose-level lower. 
Unauthorised Concomitant medications 
Concomitant  antineoplastic  therapy  (including  radiotherapy  and  surgery)  was  prohibited,  except  for 
patients deriving clinical benefit with LDK378 as described above. Other prohibited concomitant therapies 
included CYP3A4/5 substrates with narrow therapeutic index, strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4/5, 
and CYP2C9 substrates with narrow therapeutic index. Medications with a known risk of prolonging the QT 
interval or inducing Torsade de Pointes, as well as concurrent investigational drugs were not allowed. 
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/recommended dose (RD) of LDK378 (dose-escalation 
phase). 
Secondary objectives (main objective in the expansion phase):  
To characterise the safety, tolerability, PK, and anti-tumour activity of LDK378 at the RD in four different 
ALK-positive patient populations. 
Exploratory objectives:  
To identify mutations in the ALK gene or other molecular abnormalities associated with clinical 
progression after treatment with an ALK inhibitor in tumour samples collected during the pre-screening 
period in cases where ALK testing was performed centrally; to assess overall survival (OS) in patients 
treated with LDK378. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoints: 
Overall response rate (ORR, CR+PR) and duration of response (DOR) as assessed by the investigator per 
RECIST 1.0. 
These endpoints were also derived separately based on BIRC assessment. 
•  Overall  response  rate  (ORR)  was  defined  as  the  proportion  of  patients  with  a  best  overall 
response of CR or PR. 
EMA/170114/2015  
Page 56/105 
 
 
  
 
 
 
•  Duration of response was defined as the time from first documented response (PR or CR) to the 
date of first documented disease progression (PD) or death due to any cause, among patients 
with a confirmed PR or CR. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
•  Progression free survival (PFS): the time from the start date of study drug to the date of the first 
radiologically documented PD or death due to any cause, assessed by Investigator and by BIRC. 
If a patient had not progressed or was not known to have died at the date of analysis cut-off or 
had received any further anticancer therapy, PFS was censored at the date of the last adequate 
tumour evaluation before the cut-off date or before the start of the new anticancer therapy date, 
whichever  was  earlier.  Clinical  deterioration  was  not  considered  as  a  qualifying  event  for 
progression. 
•  Overall survival (OS): time from the start date of study drug to the date of death due to any 
cause. If the patient was alive at the date of the analysis cut-off or lost to follow-up, then OS was 
censored at the last contact date prior to data cut-off date. 
Sample size 
No formal statistical power calculations to determine sample size were performed for this study. During 
the expansion phase, up to 310 patients could be enrolled (including all patients treated at the RD during 
the dose-escalation phase who were eligible for the safety set) with at least 25 and up to 100 patients in 
each of NSCLC arms (Arms 1A, 1B and 2), and approximately 10 patients in Arm 3. 
Randomisation 
This was a non-comparative, single arm, open-label study. 
Blinding (masking) 
N/A 
Statistical methods 
Qualitative  data  was  summarized  by  frequency  counts  and  percentages.  Percentages  were  calculated 
using the number of patients in the relevant population or subgroup as the denominator. 
Continuous data were summarized by appropriate descriptive statistics (i.e. mean, standard deviation, 
median, minimum, and maximum). 
The analysis cut-off date was determined to ensure that at least 120 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC in 
the 750 mg dose group (from dose-escalation or expansion phases) who had received prior treatment 
with crizotinib, had received the first dose of LDK378 at least 18 weeks prior to the analysis cut-off date. 
Of these, a minimum of 80 patients were expected to have at least a baseline and a post-baseline scan 
available for central review. 
Analyses sets 
- Full Analysis Set (FAS): all patients (NSCLC and non-NSCLC) who received at least one dose of LDK378. 
Patients were classified according to the intended treatment dose group. The subset of FAS including only 
ALK-positive NSCLC patients across all doses (FAS NSCLC) was used for the supportive analysis of tumour 
response data (ORR, DOR, and PFS based on Investigator assessments) and for analysis of OS. 
- Efficacy Analysis Set (EAS): subset of the FAS-NSCLC consisting of patients with ALK-positive NSCLC 
across all doses who received the first dose of LDK378 at least 18 weeks prior to the analysis cut-off date. 
EMA/170114/2015  
Page 57/105 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The EAS is the primary data set used for the analysis of tumour response data (ORR, DOR, and PFS based 
on Investigator assessments) and for the analysis of OS. 
-  Central  Efficacy  Analysis  Set  (CEAS)  is  used  for  the  analysis  of  tumour  response  data  based  on 
independent central review assessments. It is a subset of the EAS including all NSCLC patients for whom 
EITHER the baseline scan and at least one post-baseline scan were available and evaluable by the BIRC 
OR no post-baseline scan was performed due to early death or discontinuation.  
- Safety Set consists of all patients (including NSCLC and non-NSCLC) who received at least one dose of 
LDK378. The Safety set was used for all safety analyses with the exception of the analyses based on DLTs 
which used the dose-determining set.

study was closed to enrolment on 31 July 2013. It is being conducted at 20 centres in 11 countries: 
Australia (1 centre), Belgium (1 centre), Germany (4 centres), Italy (2 centres), Netherlands (1 centre), 
Spain (1 centre), UK (1 centre), Canada (1 centre), Singapore (1 centre), Korea (1 centre), and US (6 
centres). 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The study protocol was amended six times, mainly to increase the sample size and allow characterisation 
of further efficacy and safety of ceritinib. 
Amendment 1 (20 June 2011): modifications requested by HAs, IRBs, ethics committees and several 
changes to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients with NSCLC were only eligible if they had evidence of 
ALK translocation in ≥ 15% of tumour cells as assessed by FISH. 
Amendment 2 (22 March 2012): modifications to the classification of patients in Arms 1A, 1B, and 2 based 
on exposure and response to prior ALK inhibitors. Confirmatory ALK testing by a central laboratory was no 
longer required. 
Amendment 3 (4 July 2012): to increase the sample size of the expansion arms 1A, 1B, and 2 by an 
additional 75 patients (i.e. up to 100 patients total) in each arm. The amendment also increased the 
number of allowed dose reductions from 2 to 3. 
Amendment 4 (16 January 2013): to accommodate collection of imaging data for independent 
radiological review by an imaging CRO. In order to more fully assess the LDK378 PK profile, PK samples 
were to be collected at all time points from all patients enrolled in the expansion phase of the study; the 
full profile was no longer only collected from the first 10 expansion phase patients. 
Amendment 5 (10 April 2013): to define the analysis cut-off point for the primary analyses, to specify that 
the primary analyses of antitumor activity would be performed in patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who 
had previously received crizotinib and were treated with LDK378 at a dose of 750 mg once-daily, and to 
provide additional details on the statistical analyses that were to be performed for tumour response data 
both based on Investigator assessment and an independent review of imaging. The inclusion/exclusion 
criteria were updated to exclude patients taking concomitant medications with a known risk of prolonging 
the QT interval or inducing Torsade de Pointes. 
Amendment 6 (29 August 2013): to update the available safety and efficacy information regarding 
LDK378, add guidance for treatment of patients who develop pneumonitis/interstitial lung disease that is 
considered related to LDK378, and to remove phototoxicity precautions. The definition of duration of 
response (DOR) was changed from time from first documented response to the date of first documented 
disease progression or death due to underlying cancer to the date of first documented disease progression 
or death due to any cause. 
Protocol deviations: 
Protocol deviations were reported in 23.2% of the 246 ALK-positive NSCLC patients at 750 mg. The 
deviation categories reported were: use of prohibited concomitant medications (8.9%, 22 patients), 
deviations in treatment where patients did not take LDK378 dosing as per protocol (8.1%, 20 patients), 
deviations in selection criteria (3.3%, 8 patients – for 2 patients ALK expression/translocation was 
detected by a method other than FISH and 1 patient did not have a tumor with evidence of ALK 
expression), key procedures not performed as per protocol (2.8%, 7 patients) and subject not withdrawn 
as per the protocol (0.4%, 1 patient).

Investigator reported lesion location for the baseline RECIST evaluation and was complemented by the metastatic site 
of cancer at baseline as reported in the ‘Diagnosis and Extent of Cancer’ eCRF when no thoracic lesion was identified 
from the RECIST evaluation. For further details please refer to [D120-Appendix 1-X1101-Table 14.1-3.15c], [Study 
A2201-Appendix 16.1.9b], [Study A2203-Appendix 16.1.9b]. [a] includes one patient with metastatic site in the 
meninges [b] Per RECIST 1.1, only up to 5 target lesions are recorded. SLD = sum of longest diameters in X2101 per 
RECIST 1.0; SOD = sum of diameters in A2201 and A2203 per RECIST 1.1. 
The most frequent tumour histology was adenocarcinoma (92.7%), and most of the patients had Stage IV 
at baseline. The population included was heavily pre-treated with antineoplastic agents, including

platinum based chemotherapy (80.5%). The majority of patients (66.3%) were treated with prior ALK 
inhibitor (mostly crizotinib). 
The subjects recruited in this trial consisted in a heavily pre-treated population with 163 patients 
previously exposed to an ALK inhibitor. Of them, 121 subjects received the first dose of ceritinib at least 
18 weeks prior of the cut-off date, being the target population of this application.

Table 23: Analysis of PFS based on Investigator assessment in NSCLC patients at 750 mg, by prior ALK 
inhibitor status (Study X2101 – EAS-NSCLC 750 mg) 
This table  presents data for patients with ALK-positive  NSCLC  in the 750  mg treatment dose group  who received the  first dose of 
ceritinib at least 18 weeks prior to the analysis cut-off date, EAS-NSCLC 750 mg group 
[1] All patients with prior ALK inhibitor were treated with crizotinib, in addition 5 patients received CH5424802 as their last prior ALK 
inhibitor. 
[2] Patients who had disease progression (PD) during treatment with (or within 2 weeks of last dose of) last prior ALK inhibitor therapy. 
[3] Patients who did not have PD during treatment with (or within 2 weeks of last dose of) last prior ALK inhibitor therapy. 
[4] All patients include all ALK-positive NSCLC patients treated with ceritinib 750 mg 
Percentiles with 95% CIs are calculated from PROC LIFETEST output using method of Brookmeyer and Crowley (1982). 
% Event-free probability estimate is the estimated probability that a patient will remain event-free up to the specified time point. 
% Event-free probability estimates are obtained from the Kaplan-Meier survival estimates; Greenwood formula is used for CIs of KM

Although ORR was better in subjects that had previous response with an ALK inhibitor (61.8%), subjects 
that did not respond on prior ALK inhibitor also experienced substantial response (47.2%). Response in 
patients  with  primary  resistance  to  previous  ALK  inhibitor  (mainly  crizotinib)  further  indicates  that 
ceritinib may have different mechanisms of action.

For  all  patients  in  the  registration  trial,  an  OIRR  of  45.5%  (95%  CI:  16.7,  76.6)  was  shown  (initial 
submission). This is considered to be of significant clinical importance, but as only a small number of 
patients (11/180) had brain metastases at baseline considered as target lesions uncertainty is associated 
with the results.

Supportive studies 
Study X1101  
This is a phase I, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion study in Japanese patients, currently 
on-going. The dose-escalation phase enrolled patients with tumours characterized by genetic alterations 
in ALK to determine the MTD/RD, and to evaluate the safety, PK, and anti-tumour activity of LDK378. In 
the expansion phase additional patients will be enrolled to further evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK, 
and anti-tumour activity of LDK378 at the RD. 
The study included a 3-day single dose PK run-in period to fully characterize the PK of LDK378 followed by 
a period of daily dosing in continuous 21-day treatment cycles.  
In the dose-escalation phase, successive cohorts of patients received increasing doses of LDK378 
(from 300 mg to 750 mg), until the MTD was determined. A two-parameter BLRM which employed the 
EWOC principle was used during the dose-escalation phase for dose level selection and for determination 
of the MTD. Dose-escalation decisions were based on safety information including both DLTs and other 
adverse events during Cycle 1 (including the PK run-in period). 
EMA/170114/2015  
Page 72/105 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The expansion phase was to be started after the MTD was determined (Note: as of the 02- Aug-2013 
cut-off date, no patients were enrolled in the expansion phase).  
In the dose-escalation phase patients were treated with LDK378 until they experienced unacceptable 
toxicity that precluded any further treatment, disease progression, and/or treatment was discontinued at 
the discretion of the Investigator or by patient request. The same would apply to patients who will be 
enrolled in the expansion phase. 
The efficacy endpoints used to evaluate the anti-tumour activity of LDK378 are ORR, DOR and PFS as 
assessed by the Investigator per RECIST 1.1. 
As of the cut-off date 02-Aug-2013, a total of 19 patients with locally advanced or metastatic, 
ALK-positive disease were enrolled in the dose-escalation phase of Study X1101: 300 mg (n=3), 450 mg 
(n=6), 600 mg (n=4), 750 mg (n=6), between 2-Jul-2012 and 4-Dec-2012. 
Among these were 18 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC as determined by FISH and one patient (750 mg 
dose cohort) had a non-NSCLC tumour with ALK abnormality (inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour). No 
patients were enrolled in the expansion phase prior to the cut-off date. 
All patients (19) reported in this study received the first dose of study drug more than 6 months prior to 
the analysis cut-off date. One patient treated in the study (in the 750 mg dose cohort) did not have NSCLC 
and is, therefore, not included in the EAS.  
Based on the Investigator assessments using RECIST 1.1 criteria, there were 10 confirmed PRs out of the 
18 EAS-NSCLC ALK-positive patients. The responses were observed in all dose cohorts (300 mg to 750 
mg) and were regardless of the prior ALK inhibitor used (crizotinib, CH5424802 or ASP3026).  
Four DOR events (progressions) (300 mg=2, 450 mg=1 and 600 mg=1) were observed in the 10 patients 
who had partial responses across all the dose cohorts. The median DOR in the 300 mg dose cohort based 
on Investigator assessment was 4.2 months (95% CI: 4.2, NE). The median DOR in the other dose 
cohorts were not estimable due to very few events. 
Study A2201 
This is a single-arm, open-label, multicentre, Phase II study with a single stage design to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of single-agent ceritinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive 
NSCLC previously treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy (one to three prior lines, of which 1 must have 
been a platinum doublet) and then with crizotinib. 
The  key  inclusion  criteria  included  patients  ≥  18  years  with  histologically  or  cytologically  confirmed 
diagnosis of stage IIIB or IV NSCLC carrying an ALK rearrangement. NSCLC at patient study entry should 
have progressed during therapy with crizotinib. In addition, patients had to be previously treated with 
cytotoxic  chemotherapy  (one  to  three  prior  lines,  of  which  one  must  have  been  a  platinum  doublet). 
Patients needed to have a WHO Performance Status 0 to 2 and life expectancy of ≥ 12 weeks at study 
entry. Also, patients had to have at least one measurable lesion as defined by RECIST 1.1. 
Patients with known hypersensitivity to any of the excipients of ceritinib were excluded. The following 
patients were excluded: symptomatic CNS metastases history of interstitial lung disease or interstitial 
pneumonitis, history of a second malignancy, impaired GI function, history of carcinomatous meningitis, 
or clinically significant cardiac disease. 
The  treatment  period  began  on  Day  1  of  Cycle  1.  All  patients  were  treated  with  ceritinib  750  mg 
administered orally on a once-daily dosing schedule. Each treatment cycle was 28 days (the 28 day cycle 
length was fixed regardless of whether the dose of ceritinib was withheld). Treatment with ceritinib was 
EMA/170114/2015  
Page 73/105 
 
 
  
 
 
 
continued  until  the  patient  experienced  unacceptable  toxicity  that  precluded  further  treatment, 
discontinued treatment at the discretion of the patient or investigator started a new anti-cancer therapy 
or died. 
The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate the anti-tumour activity of ceritinib, as measured 
by ORR by Investigator assessment. The secondary objectives included the evaluation of: 
- ORR as assessed by BIRC; 
- DOR, DCR, TTR, OIRR, PFS as assessed by both Investigator and BIRC;

In response to the CHMP request, the applicant was requested to provide a summary of the initial and 
updated efficacy data by investigator and BIRC assessment (see Table ).

assessments 
Study A2203 
This is a single-arm, open-label, multicentre, Phase II study with a single stage design to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of single-agent ceritinib in patients with locally advanced or metastatic ALK-positive 
NSCLC previously treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy and naïve to ALK-inhibitor treatment. 
The main differences with study A2201 regarding inclusion and exclusion criteria were that study A2203 
included  chemotherapy-naïve  patients  as  of  protocol  amendment  2  and  excluded  patients  previously 
treated with crizotinib. 
All patients were treated with ceritinib 750 mg administered orally on a once daily schedule and each 
treatment  cycle  lasted  28  days.  Treatment  with  ceritinib  continued  until  the  patient  experienced 
unacceptable toxicity that precluded further treatment, discontinued treatment at the discretion of the 
patient or Investigator, started a new anti-cancer therapy or died. 
The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate the anti-tumour activity of ceritinib, as measured 
by ORR by Investigator assessment. The secondary objectives included the evaluation of: 
- ORR as assessed by BIRC; 
- DOR, DCR, TTR, OIRR, PFS as assessed by both Investigator and BIRC;

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The efficacy (and safety) database provided with the original submission was quite limited, since just one 
phase I study was submitted to support this application. 
During the procedure, the Applicant has provided an update on the efficacy data from the phase I study 
X2101 with a data cut-off date of 13 August 2014 (performed when all patients had either completed 48 
weeks of treatment or discontinued study drug earlier) for the key efficacy endpoints (OS not updated). 
The applicant also provided updates from both phase II studies (A2201 [cut-off date: 26 February 2014] 
and A2203 [cut off-date: 27 June 2014]). No new efficacy data has been provided for the Japanese Phase 
1 Study X1101 (only SAE and death data has been captured in the global safety database).  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Overall, 515 ALK-positive NSCLC patients have been treated with ceritinib 750 mg (83 ALK inhibitor naïve 
and 163 ALK inhibitor pretreated patients in study X2101; 140 ALK inhibitor pretreated patients in study 
A2201 and 124 ALK inhibitor naïve patients in study A2203; 6 additional patients have been treated at the 
proposed dose in study X1101). 
With regards to patients’ disposition, a relevant portion of patients are still on-going in the 3 studies (99 
of 246 in study X2101, 75 of 140 in A2201 and 91 of 124 in A2203). This means that for both phase II 
studies, full OS data is not yet available.  
Sixty-eight patients out of the 246 patients treated at 750 mg in the FAS for study X2101 were enrolled 
in the EU, 101 patients from North America, and 77 in Asia. Of the 246 NSCLC, 180 patients (73.2%) who 
received the first dose of LDK378 at least 18 weeks prior to the data cut-off date were included in the 
EAS-NSCLC 750 mg group. The 18-week period was prospectively selected (as per Protocol Amendment 
5) so that patients would have sufficient follow-up for assessment and/or confirmation of response, and 
because DOR data would be limited if patients with less than 18 weeks of exposure were included. 
The primary efficacy endpoints are overall response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR), as 
assessed by the Investigator per RECIST 1.0. Taking into consideration that ORR is a measure of 
anti-tumour activity and does not provide direct evidence on patient’s benefit, PFS/OS (included as 
secondary endpoints in the registration study) would have been preferred as primary efficacy endpoints 
over ORR.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Overall, the profile of the patient population in study X2101 largely resembles the population included in 
the pivotal studies that led to crizotinib conditional approval. 
The ALK inhibitor (ALKi) pre-treated patient population comprises heavily pre-treated patients, with more 
than half of the patients having received at least 3 prior regimens, including crizotinib. The ORR (56.4% 
and 37.1%) seen in these patients exceed that expected with chemotherapy. The DOR was similarly long 
in both studies (median 8.3 and 9.2 months, respectively). Furthermore, the PFS seen in these patients 
EMA/170114/2015  
Page 75/105 
 
 
  
 
 
 
ranged from a median of 6.9 months in Study X2101 to a median of 5.7 months in Study A2201, whilst for 
OS preliminary data show a median of 16.7 and 14.0 months, respectively.  
The updated results for the primary endpoint ORR by investigator and secondary endpoints of PFS and OS, 
show a lower magnitude of effect in the phase II studies than in the phase I study. These findings are 
unexpected to some extent, because although the population in study X2101 is more heavily treated, 
efficacy results seem to be better. 
The population recruited into the study A2201 could be considered the actual target population to be 
treated in clinical practice, i.e. those patients with 2 prior treatments (chemo + crizotinib).  
In the ALKi pre-treated patients in X2101, the ORR reported by BIRC assessment was 46%, compared to 
56.4% by investigator´s assessment (approximatively 10% difference). For ALKi naïve patients, the 
difference is around the same size (63.9% by BIRC, versus 72.3% by investigator assessment). 
The Applicant stated that these differences could partly be explained by inter-observer variability, which 
can be agreed with, to some extent. However, an overestimation of the effect in study X2101 due to the 
nature of its design (being a first administration to humans, open-label, uncontrolled study which 
included an advanced patient population with limited options) could not be completely ruled out. The fact 
that both assessments (by BIRC and by investigator) in the phase II studies are concordant and that the 
BIRC assessment of study X2101 seems to be in line with those results is at least reassuring. 
The indication applied for “treatment of adult patients with previously treated anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK) positive locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)” is broad, 
including ALKi pre-treated patients as well as ALKi naïve patients (previously treated with chemotherapy). 
It is agreed that ceritinib answers an unmet medical need in the treatment of ALKi previously treated 
patients whom experienced disease progression.  
For patients who progress on or shortly after treatment with an ALK-inhibitor there are very limited 
treatment options. In this patient population, ceritinib appears to be a more efficacious treatment option 
than other currently available salvage therapies (Chemotherapy regimens). Available data indicate that 
ceritinib provides a clinically relevant benefit in those patients previously treated with an ALKi, however 
there is a need to further confirm the benefit/risk of the product before a full approval can be granted. 
The Applicant has provided the expected timelines for the presentation of the results from the on-going 
confirmatory phase II (A2201) and phase III (A2303) studies in the ALKi previously treated population 
and has proposed these 2 studies to be specific obligations for the approval. The final CSR for Study 
A2201 is estimated to be available towards Q2 2016 and the final CSR for Study A2303 is estimated to be 
available towards Q3 2018. 
The evidence supporting the use as an alternative to crizotinib for ALKi naïve NSCLC patients is considered 
weak, being based on uncontrolled, open label studies and lower than that required for currently available 
alternatives. 
In addition, the sequential use of ALKi is also a remaining concern, due to the very limited data available. 
The whole evidence available comes from studies X2101 and A2201, in which a total of 303 patients 
received ceritinib after crizotinib treatment. No data is available to date on patients receiving an ALKi after 
ceritinib treatment.  Consequently, the applicant has no data to rule out that ALKi naïve patients receiving 
ceritinib could consequently fail to respond to post-progression therapy with crizotinib or other ALKi. 
It should be noted that the crizotinib authorization was based on data from a phase II + top-line data from 
a controlled phase III trial. No further controlled data would be expected for ceritinib in ALKi naïve 
subjects.  
EMA/170114/2015  
Page 76/105 
 
 
  
 
 
 
In addition, relevant efficacy endpoints, such as PFS and OS, are still not fully mature, since a large 
number of patients are currently on-going without an event (50.6% and 62.1%, in X2101 and A2203, 
respectively). There is therefore a high level of uncertainty to the magnitude of the clinical benefit. During 
the procedure, the applicant notified of their decision to only pursue the indication in ALKi pre-treated 
patients. 
Finally, data related to the anti-tumour activity of ceritinib in brain metastases have been submitted. This 
might be of clinical value for a population in which the available alternatives provide limited activity. Data 
from study A2205, will likely add more information on this regard. Until more data is available, only 
descriptive information has been included in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA  
The updated information from the phase I and the phase II studies supporting the ALKi pretreated 
indication confirm the efficacy results initially observed, and provide reassurance on the robustness of 
these results. Although a positive benefit-risk profile can be concluded, the data have limitations inherent 
to the non-comparative nature of the studies supporting the recommendation for a conditional MA.  
In order to confirm the positive benefit-risk profile, the applicant will submit the final results of the phase 
II study A2201 expected by Q2 2016. In addition, 177 patients out of the target 236 patients (75% 
completed) have been randomized in the ongoing phase III comparative study (A2303). Enrolment is 
expected to be completed by end of August 2015 and the approval of ceritinib in the EU is not expected 
to impact completion of recruitment in this study. The final study report of study A2303 will allow a more 
comprehensive data package to be submitted in Q3 2018. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In conclusion, the efficacy of ceritinib in the treatment of ALK-positive NSCLC is currently based on the 
results of three uncontrolled, open label studies (the extension phase of one phase I and two phase II 
clinical trials). The absence of direct comparative data with other agents represents an important 
limitation. Although more mature data has been provided, the absence of controlled studies dot not allow 
a better understanding of the benefit on PFS, the real effect on PROs and on OS. Despite these limitations, 
it is acknowledged that results in patients with prior ALK inhibitor treatment have a meaningful clinical 
value since there is an unmet medical need.  
For ALK inhibitor naïve patients the evidence provided was insufficient to fulfil requirements for a 
conditional approval. .  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the context 
of a conditional MA: 
- To submit the final clinical study report of phase II study A2201 by Q2 2016; 
- To submit the final clinical study report of phase III study A2303 by Q3 2018. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety profile provided with the initial submission was mainly based on study X2101, an open-label, 
uncontrolled study, which included a total of 304 patients (main safety set: 290 patients with ALK-positive 
NSCLC and 14 patients with non-NSCL tumours), 255 treated at the proposed dose of 750mg. Available 
data from the other phase I open-label study (X1101) was also  provided (n=19), along with available 
data on SAEs and deaths for patients included in the on-going phase II studies with LDK378 (A2201 and 
A2203). The cut-off date used for most of the data analyses was 2 August 2013. 
EMA/170114/2015  
Page 77/105 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Patient exposure 
In the initial submission, patients from the safety set treated with the proposed dose (n=255), the median 
duration of exposure was only 19.6 weeks, with almost half of patients having an exposure <18 week. A 
total of 133 (52.2%) patients in the 750 mg dose group required a dose reduction, all of them due to AEs. 
At least one dose interruption was observed in 155 patients (60.8%) in this group. AEs were the reason 
for dose interruption in 134 (86.5%) of these patients. These data suggest that the proposed dose of 
750mg is not well-tolerated. 
During the procedure, the Applicant provided an updated safety dataset. As a result, the safety dataset 
includes 525 patients exposed to ceritinib in the clinical studies (studies X2101, A2201, A2203 and 
X1101) and treated at the proposed dose of 750mg, as well as 62 patients treated with lower doses (from 
studies X2101 and X1101). Information on deaths and SAE reported to the Novartis safety database has 
also been provided. The duration of exposure in the pooled dataset is summarised in the table below.

The most frequently observed SOCs wherein at least 50% of all patients reported one or more events 
were: gastrointestinal disorders (97.9%), investigations (73.5%), general disorders and administrative 
site  conditions  (68.0%),  metabolism  and  nutrition  disorders  (59.6%)  and  respiratory,  thoracic  and 
mediastinal disorders (50.3).  
The AEs suspected to be study drug related (all grades, by PT) reported in ≥ 25% of the patients were: 
GI toxicity events (diarrhoea 81.7%, nausea 77.7%, vomiting 60.0%) and increased transaminases (ALT 
39.2%,  AST  29.1%);  decreased  appetite  (34.9%),  abdominal  pain  (30.9%),  fatigue  (29.3%)  and 
constipation  (25.1%)  were  also  reported  in  ≥25%  of  patients.  The  most  frequent  (>3%  of  patients) 
grade 3-4 AEs assessed as related to study drug were ALT increased (20.2%), AST increased (6.9%), 
GGT increased (6.9%) diarrhoea (5.0%), ALP increased (4.4%), nausea (4.4%), vomiting (4.0%), and 
fatigue (3.4%). 
Findings across the different dose ranges (50-750mg) in the safety set followed the same trend observed 
for the 750mg group (data not shown). 
Dose reduction and dose interruptions 
In Studies X2101, A2201 and A2203, a maximum of three dose reductions were allowed for each patient, 
after which the patient was discontinued from the study drug. Dose reductions permitted were 750 mg to 
600 mg, 600 mg to 450 mg and 450 mg to 300 mg. In Study X1101, dose reductions were allowed for 
each patient until a minimum dose of 150 mg was reached after which the patient was discontinued from 
the study. For each patient, once a dose level reduction occurred, re-escalation to the higher dose was not 
allowed during subsequent treatment cycles. The table below summarizes doses reductions observed in 
the safety dataset.

Adverse drug reactions 
ADRs were screened and identified based on a number of factors such as investigator’s causality (e.g., 
related AEs/SAEs), frequency and consistency of reporting, biological plausibility, class effects, and 
dechallenge and rechallenge information. Once the ADRs were selected, their frequency calculation was 
made from the totality of the events reported for each AE. The ADRs and respective frequencies are

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
An overview of deaths and other serious or clinically relevant AEs in the pooled dataset is provided in 
Table 40. 
SAEs (irrespective of causality) were reported in 38.3% of patients. The majority of these patients had 
SAEs associated with the underlying disease, including events of disease progression and deteriorating 
pulmonary status/respiratory complications. 
Of the 68 deaths reported on-treatment in the pooled dataset, 49 deaths were directly attributed to study 
indication. Of the 19 patients with cause of death listed as "Other", 15 patients died from co-morbidities 
and/or conditions associated with progression of the underlying malignancy, and were assessed as not 
related to study drug by the Investigator. For one patient, the cause of death was reported as unknown; 
prior to the death, the patient experienced disease progression. The remaining 3 deaths (2 in Study 
X2101 and 1 in Study A2201) were considered related to study drug by the Investigator. In Study X2101, 
one death was due to ILD and the second was due to multi-organ failure that occurred in the context of 
infection and ischemic hepatitis. The third death reported in Study A2201 was due to pneumonia.

Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) 
Adverse events of special interest have been identified based on emerging clinical information from the 
ongoing clinical studies. According to the applicant, the AESIs for ceritinib are hepatotoxicity, interstitial 
lung disease (ILD)/pneumonitis, QT prolongation, bradycardia, hyperglycaemia, and GI toxicity. 
Hepatotoxicity 
Hepatotoxicity AEs (primarily ALT increased and AST increased) were reported in 53.1% of patients, with 
grade 3-4 AEs reported in 31.0% of patients. The event required dose adjustment or interruption in 
34.9% of patients and led to discontinuation in 0.8% of patients. The event was serious in 2.3% of 
patients. There were no deaths due to a hepatotoxicity AE. 
Concurrent elevations of ALT greater than 3× ULN and total bilirubin greater than 2× ULN without 
elevated alkaline phosphatase have been observed in less than 1% of patients in clinical studies with 
ceritinib. Increases to grade 3 or 4 ALT elevations were observed in 25% of patients receiving ceritinib.

Hyperglycaemia AEs (primarily hyperglycaemia and diabetes mellitus) were reported in 11.4% of patients 
with grade 3-4 AEs in 6.1% (5.0% for hyperglycaemia). The event required dose adjustment or 
interruption in 2.1% of patients and led to discontinuation in 0.2%. The event was serious in 2.3% of 
patients. There were no deaths due to a hyperglycaemia AE.

GI toxicity 
GI AEs (i.e., diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting) were reported in 96.0% patients and were suspected to be 
related to study drug by the Investigator in 94.9%. Most of the AEs were grade 1-2; grade 3-4 AEs were 
reported in 12.2% of patients. The event required dose adjustment or interruption in 33.0% of patients. 
The proportion of patients with SAEs was low (3.6%) the AEs led to discontinuation in 0.6% of patients. 
GI AEs were managed primarily with concomitant medications (reported in 84.8% of patients) and/or 
with dose adjustment or interruption of study drug (reported in 33.0% of patients).

The table below summarises the AEs leading to drug discontinuation in Studies X2101, A2201, and 
A2203. 
Table 48: AEs Leading to Study Drug Discontinuation in Patients Treated at 750 mg of ceritinib in Studies 
X2101, A2201, and A2203 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The median duration of exposure to ceritinib 750 mg is 38.7 weeks (range 0.4-106.1) in Study X2101; 
28.1 weeks (range 0.3-60.1) in study A2201; 34.9 weeks (range 0.4-70.3) in study A2203; and 33.0 
weeks (range 0.3-106.1) in the pooled dataset.  
In the pooled dataset, almost all patients (99.8%) experienced an AE, 73% being grade 3-4, and over half 
of the AEs were suspected to be drug-related. The majority of patients (78%) experienced >10 AEs, with 
a median of 17 AEs (ranging from 1 to 171). Almost half of the AEs (4483/11157) required additional 
therapy. Dose reductions were performed at least once in more than half of the patients (57.8%) treated 
with ceritinib however treatment discontinuations due to AEs were not frequent (8.8%). 
EMA/170114/2015 
Page 93/105 
 
 
  
  
 
 
ADRs with an incidence of ≥10% were diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, liver laboratory test 
abnormalities, abdominal pain, decreased appetite, constipation, rash, blood creatinine increased, 
oesophageal disorder and anaemia. The most frequently reported Grade 3-4 adverse reactions (≥5%) 
were liver laboratory test abnormalities, fatigue, diarrhoea, nausea and hyperglycaemia. 
The most frequently observed SOC was gastrointestinal disorders (97.9%). In terms of duration, these 
events were persistent (median duration of 62.0 days, 53.0 days, 19.0 days and 81 days, for diarrhoea 
AEs, nausea AEs, vomiting AEs and their combination, respectively) and recurrent. Grade 3-4 events of 
diarrhoea, nausea or vomiting were reported in 12.2% of patients. Patients should be monitored and 
managed using standards of care, including anti-diarrhoeals, anti-emetics or fluid replacement, as 
clinically indicated. Dose interruption and dose reduction should be employed as necessary. If vomiting 
occurs during the course of treatment, the patient should not take an additional dose, but should continue 
with the next scheduled dose. (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC) 
Hepatic enzyme elevations were frequently reported and led to dose adjustments or temporary 
interruptions, but no permanent drug discontinuations. 
Cases of hepatotoxicity occurred in less than 1% of patients receiving ceritinib in clinical studies. 
Increases to grade 3 or 4 ALT elevations were observed in 25% of patients. The majority of cases were 
manageable with dose interruption and/or dose reduction. Few events required discontinuation of 
treatment. Patients should be monitored with liver laboratory tests (including ALT, AST and total bilirubin) 
prior to the start of treatment, every 2 weeks for the first month of treatment and monthly thereafter. In 
patients who develop transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring of liver transaminases and total 
bilirubin should be carried out as clinically indicated. Ceritinib is not recommended in patients with 
moderate or severe hepatic impairment. 
Severe, life threatening or fatal interstitial lung disease (ILD) / pneumonitis have been observed in 
patients treated with ceritinib in clinical studies. Most cases improved or resolved with interruption of 
treatment. Patients should therefore be monitored for pulmonary symptoms indicative of pneumonitis. 
Other potential causes of pneumonitis should be excluded, and ceritinib permanently discontinued in 
patients diagnosed with treatment related pneumonitis. 
QTc prolongation has been observed in clinical studies in patients treated with ceritinib, which may lead 
to an increased risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmias (e.g. torsade de pointes) or sudden death. A clear 
trend towards increased QTc-interval prolongation with increasing doses was observed in a linear mixed 
effects model (see clinical pharmacology). In addition, preclinical studies showed increases in QT/QTc in 
one of four monkeys exposed with ceritinib concentrations twice the Cmax in patients, and indirect and 
probable influence on the QT-interval was demonstrated by in vitro blocking of hERG ion channels. 
The use of ceritinib in patients with congenital long QT syndrome should therefore be avoided. The 
benefits and potential risks of ceritinib should be considered before beginning therapy in patients who 
have pre-existing bradycardia, patients who have a history of or predisposition for QTc prolongation, 
patients who are taking anti-arrhythmics or other medicinal products that are known to prolong the QT 
interval and patients with relevant pre-existing cardiac disease and/or electrolyte disturbances. Periodic 
monitoring with ECGs and periodic monitoring of electrolytes (e.g. potassium) is recommended in these 
patients. In the event of vomiting, diarrhoea, dehydration or impaired renal function, correct electrolytes 
as clinically indicated. Ceritinib should be permanently discontinued in patients who develop QTc >500 
msec or >60 msec change from baseline and torsade de pointes or polymorphic ventricular tachycardia or 
signs/symptoms of serious arrhythmia. Ceritinib should be withheld in patients who develop QTc >500 
msec on at least two separate ECGs until recovery to baseline or a QTc ≤480 msec, then reinitiated with 
dose reduced by one decrement. 
EMA/170114/2015 
Page 94/105 
 
 
  
  
 
Asymptomatic cases of bradycardia have been observed in 10 out of 525 (1.9%) patients treated with 
ceritinib in clinical studies. The use of ceritinib in combination with other agents known to cause 
bradycardia (e.g. beta blockers, non dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, clonidine and digoxin) 
should be avoided as far as possible. Heart rate and blood pressure should be monitored regularly. In 
cases of symptomatic bradycardia that is not life threatening, ceritinib should be withheld until recovery 
to asymptomatic bradycardia or to a heart rate of 60 bpm or above, the use of concomitant medicinal 
products should be evaluated and the ceritinib dose adjusted if necessary. In the event of life threatening 
bradycardia ceritinib should be permanently discontinued if no contributing concomitant medicinal 
product is identified; however, if associated with a concomitant medicinal product known to cause 
bradycardia or hypotension, ceritinib should be withheld until recovery to asymptomatic bradycardia or to 
a heart rate of 60 bpm or above. If the concomitant medicinal product can be adjusted or discontinued, 
ceritinib should be reinitiated with dose reduced by two decrements on recovery to asymptomatic 
bradycardia or to a heart rate of 60 bpm or above, with frequent monitoring (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 
of the SmPC). 
Cases of hyperglycaemia (all grades) have been reported in less than 10% of patients treated with 
ceritinib in clinical studies; grade 3/4 hyperglycaemia was reported in 5% of patients. The risk of 
hyperglycaemia was higher in patients with diabetes mellitus and/or concurrent steroid use. 
Patients should be monitored for fasting plasma glucose prior to the start of ceritinib treatment and 
periodically thereafter as clinically indicated. Anti-hyperglycaemic medicinal products should be initiated 
or optimised as indicated (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Available safety data for specific patient subgroups, such as ALK-inhibitor pre-treated patients 
(with/without progressing during treatment) and ALK-inhibitor naïve patients, indicate a similar profile. 
The profile observed in the 65 to 75 years old subgroup is similar to that of the <65 year old subgroup, 
with a numerically higher frequency for some events (GI AEs, Psychiatric disorders, age-related AEs such 
as syncope, injuries, and falls). AEs leading to discontinuation and SAEs were also numerically higher in 
the >65-75 years old subgroup. There are no data in the older patient subgroup (patients over the age of 
85) which has been reflected in the SmPC. 
Ceritinib should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman requires 
treatment with ceritinib.  
It is unknown whether ceritinib/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to the newborn/infant 
cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast feeding or 
discontinue/abstain from ceritinib therapy taking into account the benefit of breast feeding for the child 
and the benefit of therapy for the woman (see sections 4.6 and 5.3 of the SmPC). 
Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Ceritinib has minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. Caution should be exercised when 
driving or using machines during treatment as patients may experience fatigue or vision disorders. 
Overdose 
There is no reported experience with overdose in humans. General supportive measures should be 
initiated in all cases of overdose. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
The submission of the final CSRs for the phase II study A2201 and phase III study A2303 will provide 
additional information regarding the safety profile of ceritinib.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The most frequent ADRs are gastrointestinal disorders and increased liver enzymes. The most serious 
ADRs are hepatotoxicity, ILD/pneumonitis, QT prolongation and bradycardia. Although ceritinib is not a 
well-tolerated treatment, the safety profile appears to be clinically manageable.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Overall, 515 ALK-positive NSCLC patients have been treated with ceritinib 750 mg (83 ALK inhibitor naïve 
and 163 ALK inhibitor pretreated patients in study X2101; 140 ALK inhibitor pretreated patients in study 
A2201 and 124 ALK inhibitor naïve patients in study A2203; 5 additional patients have been treated at the 
proposed dose in study X1101). 
The ALK inhibitor pretreated patients comprise a heavily pretreated patient population, with more than 
half of the patients having received at least 3 prior regimens, including crizotinib. The ORR (56.4% in 
study X2101 and 37.1% in study A2201) seen in these patients exceed that expected with chemotherapy 
and  indicate  that  patients  who  have  progressed  on  a  prior  ALK  inhibitor  have  a  high  likelihood  of 
responding  to  ceritinib.  The  DOR  was  similarly  long  in  both  studies  (median  8.3  and  9.2  months, 
respectively). Furthermore, the PFS seen in these patients ranged from a median of 6.9 months in Study 
X2101 to a median of 5.7 months in Study A2201, whilst for OS preliminary data show a median of 16.7 
and 14.0 months, respectively.  
For the ALK inhibitor naïve population, the majority of the patients had received at least a platinum agent 
(Study X2101), or a platinum doublet (Study A2203). An ORR of 72.3% was shown in the updated results 
from study X2101, which is in line with the primary analysis (69.5%). A lower response was seen in Study 
A2203 (63.7%). DOR is still immature for Study X2101 [17.02 (11.27, NE) months] as for Study A2203 
[9.3 (9.1, NE) months]. At the time of the last data cut-off available, a PFS event had been experienced 
by  39.8%  in  Study  X2101  and  32.3%  in  Study  X2203.  Although  the  PFS  analyses  are  immature,  a 
substantially longer median PFS was seen in Study X2101 [18.4 (11.1, NE)] than in Study 2203 [11.1 
(9.3, NE) months]. Survival data is not yet available. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
The  efficacy  of  ceritinib  in  the  treatment  of  ALK-positive  NSCLC  is  based  on  the  results  of  three 
uncontrolled, open label clinical trials (one phase I, 2 phase II studies). The absence of direct comparative 
data with other agents is an important limitation. 
The  Applicant  initially  claimed  a  broad  indication  in  the  treatment  of  previously  treated  ALK  positive 
NSCLC, which includes ALKi naïve and ALKi previously treated patients. Overall, the available efficacy 
data for ALKi naïve patients with NSCLC is limited and most of the efficacy endpoints are still immature, 
which brings uncertainty to the magnitude of the clinical benefit. Considering that for these patients, a 
treatment  option  is  currently  approved,  and  that  efficacy  assessment  in  single  arm  studies  involves 
substantial uncertainties, it cannot be justified to conclude on benefit/risk based on partially immature 
data  from  two  single  arm  studies.  No  results  from  the  ongoing  phase  III  Study  A2301  (ceritinib  vs. 
chemotherapy)  could  be  provided  during  this  procedure,  and  there  is  no  data  available  comparing 
ceritinib to crizotinib.  
EMA/170114/2015 
Page 100/105 
 
 
  
  
 
In  addition,  there  are  concerns  that  ALKi  naïve  patients  receiving  ceritinib  could  consequently  fail  to 
respond to post-progression therapy with crizotinib. According to the applicant there are no non-clinical or 
clinical data comparing sequential therapy with ALK inhibitors (i.e., crizotinib followed by ceritinib versus 
ceritinib followed by crizotinib). Concerning mutation status, the applicant has presented data suggesting 
that patients resistant to crizotinib can be sensitive to ceritinib. However, the applicant has not provided 
any  data  suggesting  that  patients  resistant  to  ceritinib  are  sensitive  to  crizotinib.  Consequently,  the 
applicant  has  no  data  to  alleviate  the  concern  that  ALKi  naïve  patients  receiving  ceritinib  could 
consequently fail to respond to post-progression therapy with crizotinib or other ALKi.  
The data supporting the ALKi  pretreated indications also have limitations given the non-comparative 
nature of the studies presented. The phase III comparative study has just started, but no data has been 
available during the procedure. It is nevertheless acknowledged that the updated information from the 
phase I and the phase II studies confirm the efficacy results initially observed, and provide reassurance 
on the robustness of these results.  
While some differences are observed for all three studies between investigator´s and BIRC assessment, 
these  differences  are  more  evident  for  study  X2101,  and  more  particularly  for  the  ORR  results.    The 
Applicant stated that these differences could partly be explained by inter-observer variability, which can 
be agreed with to some extent. However, an overestimation of the effect in study X2101 due to the nature 
of  its  design  (being  a  first  administration  to  humans,  open-label,  uncontrolled  study  including  an 
advanced  patient  population  with  limited  options)  could  not  be  completely  ruled  out.  The  fact  that 
assessments by BIRC and by investigator in the phase II studies are very concordant and that the BIRC 
assessment of study X2101 seems to be in line with those results is reassuring. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The pooled safety dataset includes 525 patients exposed to ceritinib 750 mg, with a mean duration of 
treatment of 35.3 (21.89) weeks.  
The  most  common  adverse  reactions  observed  across  studies  were  GI  disorders  (nausea,  diarrhea, 
vomiting,  and  constipation),  followed  by  general  disorders  and  administrative  site  conditions,  and 
investigations. The most frequently reported Grade 3-4 adverse reactions were increased ALT, increased 
AST, diarrhea, lipase increased, and hyperglycemia. 
Hepatic  enzyme  elevations  were  frequently  reported  and  led  to  dose  adjustments  or  temporary 
interruptions,  but  no  permanent  drug  discontinuations.  There  were  2  DILI  cases  in  the  original 
submission, one on each phase I study.  
Ceritinib has been associated with study-drug related pneumonitis/ ILD, a class-effect known for some 
tyrosine kinase targeting drugs. Out of the 525 patients across the 4 clinical studies, a total of 17 cases 
were detected, including one case of pneumonitis with fatal outcome.  
Cardiac  disorders  including  bradycardia  and  ECG  abnormalities  have  also  been  observed  during  the 
conducted studies. 
The  safety  profile  of  ceritinib  is  somewhat  similar  to  that  seen  with  crizotinib.  Considering  that  the 
intended  target  population  is  patients  previously  treated  with  crizotinib,  a  subset  of  the  studied 
population,  no  meaningful  differences  were  observed  with  AE  profile  shown  for  ALKi  naïve  patients. 
Although patients treated with ceritinib experience a high incidence of adverse drug reactions, the safety 
profile of ceritinib seems to be clinically manageable. 
EMA/170114/2015 
Page 101/105 
 
 
  
  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The safety profile appears reasonably well characterized with respect to the most frequent AEs, which 
overall seem to be clinically manageable. However there are uncertainties related to the overall limited 
database and the long term safety given that the median duration of exposure in the pooled dataset is 33 
weeks. There are also uncertainties concerning some drug-drug interactions as well as use in patients 
with  moderate  and  severe  hepatic  impairment,  and  their  potential  safety  implications,  which  will  be 
addressed as post-approval commitments. In addition, the limited available safety data in elderly patients 
(>75 years of age) preclude firm conclusions on the safety in this group of patients, but based on data 
available there are not specific reasons to limit use of ceritinib in this population. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Patients for whom the disease progresses on or shortly after treatment with an ALK-inhibitor have limited 
treatment options and therefore there is a high unmet medical need. In this patient population, ceritinib 
appears a more efficacious treatment option compared to currently available therapies.  
For ALKi naïve patients, the presently available information on efficacy is limited since most of the 
time-to-event analyses are still immature. No data comparing the efficacy of ceritinib versus crizotinib is 
available and the concern regarding sequential treatment with crizotinib after ceritinib has not been 
elucidated. Therefore efficacy in the ALKI naïve population is not considered demonstrated. 
The use of ceritinib is associated with relevant toxicities, and the tolerability of this treatment should be 
considered in the context of a pre-treated population with not optimal performance status. Therefore, 
although the AEs seem to be clinically manageable, ceritinib is not well tolerated. This is further supported 
by the persistent and recurrent nature of the most frequent AEs. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The benefits in the population of patients previously treated with an ALK inhibitor outweigh the risks 
related to the use of ceritinib. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
The effect of ceritinib on tumour burden is relevant in a population with limited treatment options. This 
ORR is not usually observed in solid tumours and especially after several lines of chemotherapy. Historical 
data in patients treated with chemotherapy (pemetrexed) in second line have shown ORR of 29% at best, 
with median of PFS of 4.2 months.  
Despite the fact that the ORR in the phase II studies seem to be lower than initially reported (based on 
both IRC analyses and updated outcomes), these results are considered relevant.  
However in ALKi naïve patients, the available efficacy data is limited and most of the efficacy endpoints 
are still immature which brings uncertainty to the magnitude of the clinical benefit. Considering that for 
these patients, a valid treatment option is available, and that efficacy assessment in single arm studies 
involves substantial uncertainties, it cannot be justified to base the efficacy assessment solely on partially 
immature data from two single arm studies. No results from the ongoing phase III Study A2301 (ceritinib 
vs. chemotherapy) will be provided during this procedure, and there is no data available comparing 
ceritinib to crizotinib.  
It is agreed that there is a need for new therapies able to improve the unfavourable prognostic of these 
patients. However crizotinib is currently available for these patients and ceritinib has not yet robustly 
demonstrated a significant benefit compared to crizotinib. In addition, none of the proposed studies are 
aimed to provide confirmatory data on the efficacy of ceritinib in the treatment of ALKi naïve patients 
EMA/170114/2015 
Page 102/105 
 
 
  
  
previously exposed to chemotherapy. Study 2301 will provide data in the first line clinical setting, while 
Study 2205 will only provide data from a cohort of patients previously exposed to chemotherapy. The 
benefit risk balance of the ALKi naïve patients indication is considered negative. 
Patients for whom the disease progresses on or shortly after treatment with an ALK-inhibitor have limited 
treatment options and therefore a high unmet medical need. An ORR in the range of 37-56%, and a DOR 
of approximately 8-9 months confirm that ceritinib has a strong anti-tumour activity in these patients. 
Median PFS was 6.9 (5.6, 8.7) months in Phase I study X2101 and 5.7 (5.3, 7.4) months in Phase II study 
A2201. The median PFS in the two studies are thus very similar, and considered to represent a reliable 
estimate of a PFS following treatment with ceritinib in prior ALKi treated patients. A PFS of 6-7 months is 
also considered of clinical benefit to these patients, since in this setting; the experience is that 
chemotherapy results in median PFS of approximately 3 months. In addition, although not fully mature, 
median overall survival data represents a clinical benefit when compared to existing treatment options. 
Taking into account the risk related to the open-label nature of the data, it is considered that the available 
data is considered sufficient to conclude that the benefit-risk of ceritinib in the ALKi pre-treated  patient 
population is positive although the clinical data package supporting the benefit-risk is not considered 
comprehensive.  
The CHMP considered that Zykadia falls under the scope of Article 2(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
507/2006: 
- Medicinal products which aim at the treatment, the prevention or the medical diagnosis of seriously 
debilitating diseases or life-threatening diseases 
and is thus eligible for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation. 
Furthermore, all the requirements listed in Article 4(1) of the Commission Regulation (EC) No. 507/2006 
apply to Zykadia on the basis of the following reasons: 
a) The risk-benefit balance of the product is positive. 
See Discussion on benefit-risk balance. 
b) It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive clinical data: 
The applicant will provide further comprehensive clinical data to confirm efficacy of ceritinib in the 
proposed indication from the final results of the phase II study A2201 expected by Q2 2016. In addition, 
the results of an ongoing phase III comparative study (A2303) in patients previously treated with 
crizotinib will further support the benefit-risk evaluation of ceritinib. The final study report of study A2303 
is expected to be submitted by Q3 2018. 
c) Fulfilment of unmet medical need in the proposed indications: 
Currently there are no approved treatment options for patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who have 
progressed on or after treatment with crizotinib. The efficacy data supporting the MA indicate that 
patients who have progressed on or after treatment with crizotinib have a high likelihood of responding to 
ceritinib. 
d) The benefits to patients of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that 
additional data are still required: 
In view of the favourable benefit-risk profile and the unmet medical need (see above), the immediate 
availability of Zykadia outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. 
The CHMP concluded that all the requirements for the granting of a conditional marketing authorisation 
had been met.

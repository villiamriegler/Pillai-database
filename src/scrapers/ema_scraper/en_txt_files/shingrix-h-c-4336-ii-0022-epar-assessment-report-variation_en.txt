evaluation of Shingrix in individuals with underlying autoimmune disease; a second part concerned the 
question, whether the clinical data package generated in subjects ≥18 years of age is sufficient to 
support the submission of an application for the extension of the Shingrix indication to adults ≥18 years 
of age. The CHMP stated that the amount of data in healthy young individuals is too limited and some 
further data on safety, and particularly local and systemic reactogenicity, from healthy young adults 
should be provided in any application to allow use from 18 years without any qualification. Within this 
submission, the applicant now decided to only seek licensure for the use in adults 18 years of age or older 
at increased risk of HZ.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Herpes Zoster (HZ), commonly known as shingles, is caused by the reactivation of latent varicella zoster 
virus (VZV). Primary VZV infection results in varicella (chickenpox), after which VZV becomes latent in 
neurons of the dorsal root and cranial nerve ganglia. Following a variable period of latency, VZV can 
reactivate to produce infectious virus. This virus can travel to the skin and re-infect it, causing HZ. The 
lifetime risk of HZ is estimated to be 10-30%. HZ is thought to be associated with a decline in cell 
mediated immunity (CMI) due to aging or to an immunosuppressive illness or treatment. 
HZ typically presents as an acute, painful, vesicular eruption distributed along a single dermatome. The 
most common complication of HZ is postherpetic neuralgia (PHN), defined as pain that persists beyond 90 
days after the onset of the zoster rash. This pain is often chronic and debilitating and difficult to treat 
effectively. Other less frequent HZ complications include HZ ophthalmicus (HZO), neurological 
complications such as VZV encephalitis and meningitis, and disseminated HZ. Ramsay Hunt syndrome 
rarely occurs but is a common cause of facial nerve paralysis. An increased risk of stroke up to 3 months 
after a HZ episode has also been described. 
Epidemiological evidence confirms that the risk of HZ increases dramatically in adults ≥18 YOA who are 
immunodeficient or immunosuppressed due to disease or therapy, placing them at a risk comparable to 
and in many instances far exceeding the risk seen in the general adult population ≥50 YOA. 
Immunocompromised (IC) individuals are not only at increased risk for the development of HZ but also 
develop more severe HZ than immunocompetent person, including persistent post-HZ pain and PHN 
complications. In IC patients, the HZ rash tends to be more severe and its duration prolonged. Cutaneous 
dissemination, visceral involvement (including varicella pneumonitis and hepatitis), VZV retinitis and 
acute retinal necrosis, meningoencephalitis, and chronic progressive encephalitis have been reported in 
IC patients. Chronic HZ may also occur in IC patients. Even if most HZ cases occur in older adults, IC 
patients therefore contribute substantially to the public health burden.  
Beside immunosuppression, many chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, COPD, cardiovascular 
diseases, renal diseases are associated with an increased risk of HZ. PHN also appears to be more severe 
and persistent in diabetic patients. 
Epidemiology and risk factors 
Seroprevalence 
In Europe, most Varicella Zoster Virus (VZV) infections occur in childhood with a rapid acquisition of 
antibodies to VZV and by 15‒19 years most individuals are seropositive (ECDC 2014). Overall, more than 
89% of young adults (20-29 years old) are seropositive to VZV in EU. Therefore, most adults 50 years 
and older is at risk for the development of HZ. 
Overall disease incidence 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 9/173 
 
 
  
  
 
The overall incidence rate (IR) of HZ in Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific is about 3 to 5 cases per 
1000 person-years (PY) (Kawai, 2014). 
The most common complication of HZ is PHN. About 5 to 30% of people who get HZ will experience PHN 
(depending of the type of study design and age distribution of study populations). Other less frequent HZ 
complications include HZ ophthalmicus (HZO) which occurs in 10% to 15% of HZ patients (Johnson 2014, 
Kawai 2014). Other complications are less frequent. 
Disease incidence by risk factor 
Age 
The incidence of HZ increases markedly as of the age of 50, with two-thirds of HZ cases occurring in 
adults ≥ 50 years of age (Yawn 2007, Kawai 2014). The incidence increases with age from about 1-4 per 
1,000 PY in adults aged 40–50 years, 7-8 per 1,000 PY in 60-70 years old, up to 10 per 1,000 PY after 80 
years of age (YOA) (Pinchinat 2013). 
Altered immunocompetence 
Although most HZ cases occur in older adults, immunocompromised patients have a much greater risk of 
HZ compared to immunocompetent individuals of the same age (O’Connor 2013). 
Table 1 summaries the incidence of HZ in the overall population and among particular IC populations. 
Among adults ≥18 YOA with IC conditions, patients who undergo HCT show the highest risk for HZ among 
the IC conditions. In addition to the underlying disease, the immunosuppressive cancer therapy may also 
be a risk factor for developing HZ in patients with haematological malignancies.  
Patients with autoimmune disease are also at increased risk of HZ reactivation. In addition to the risk 
autoimmune disease may independently pose, most of these conditions are managed with 
immunosuppressive therapies that impair T cell immunity likely contributing to the increased rates of HZ 
seen in this population (Chakravarty, 2017) (Table 1).  
Disease-induced immunosuppression has been proposed as a mechanism for increasing the risk of HZ in 
patients with other chronic diseases that directly affect CMI like HIV as well as those with less well 
defined mechanism of immunosuppression like type II diabetes mellitus (Table 1). In people living with 
HIV under highly active antiretroviral therapy (ART), HZ incidence has declined over time but remains 
higher than the rates reported in the general population (Moanna2013).

Other risk factors 
Other important risk factors described in the literature are co-morbidities such as renal diseases, COPD, 
asthma, and cardiovascular diseases. Other non-medical factors such as a recent physical trauma, stress, 
sleep disturbance, depression, recent weight loss, family history of HZ, female gender and Afro-American 
ethnicity are also associated with an increased risk of HZ (Marin 2016, Kawai 2017, Marra 2020). 
Results from a recent meta-analysis based on 88 studies, excluding studies that used immunosuppressive 
medications, are summarized below (Marra 2020) and confirmed previous results observed in the meta-
analysis performed by Kawai in 2017.

The main existing treatment options are: 
Therapeutic measures for the management of HZ and acute HZ pain 
In immunocompetent adults, antiviral therapy has been shown to decrease the duration of the HZ rash 
and the severity of pain associated with the rash, in particular in patients who received treatment within 
72 hours after the onset of rash. Therefore, antiviral therapies, such as acyclovir, famciclovir and 
valacyclovir are used in the acute phase of infection with the main aims of reducing and/or stopping viral 
replication, which is thought to play a role in relieving pain and shortening duration of symptoms 
(Dworkin 2007b).  
A variety of approaches have also been used with varying degrees of success for control of acute HZ pain, 
including acetaminophen, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, tricyclic antidepressants, opioids, 
anticonvulsants, capsaicin, and topical anesthetics (Dworkin 2007b).

Therapeutic measures for the management of chronic pain 
A recent Cochrane review, which considered all randomized controlled trials of antiviral treatment given 
within 72 hours after the onset of HZ for preventing PHN, showed that oral acyclovir does not reduce the 
incidence of PHN, while there is insufficient evidence to determine the effect of other antiviral treatments 
(Chen 2014). Furthermore, the addition of systemic glucocorticoids to antiviral drugs during the acute 
phase of HZ does not reduce the incidence of PHN (Wood 1994, Whitley 2010). 
Treatment of PHN is aimed to control symptoms, as no disease-modifying therapy is currently available 
(van Wijck 2006). Treatment may involve topical therapy (lidocaine or capsaicin as first-line treatment for 
mild pain) and systemic therapy, generally with anti-epileptic drugs gabapentin and pregabalin, or 
tricyclic antidepressants (Johnson 2014). Conflicting evidences exist on the use of potent opioids (such as 
oxycodone) and tramadol in treating PHN (McNicol 2013, Johnson 2014, Finnerup 2015). Therefore 
opioids, including tramadol, should generally be considered as third-line drugs for treatment of PHN after 
consultation with a specialist and should be prescribed only with close monitoring. 
Preventative option for the management of HZ 
Vaccination for HZ prevention is available to decrease HZ and PHN in individuals over 50 years of age.  
A live-attenuated VZV vaccine (Zostavax®,Merck & Co) has been licensed in several countries since 2006 
and, in EU, is recommended for use in immunocompetent adults ≥50 yrs to prevent HZ and PHN. This 
vaccine is contraindicated in immunosuppressed or immunodeficient individuals due to concerns of 
possible vaccine-associated disseminated disease. 
Other inactivated vaccines have been evaluated in IC populations. A heat inactivated VZV vaccine (V212, 
Merck & Co) was shown to reduce the incidence of HZ by 63.8% in autologous HSCT recipients ≥18 YOA, 
also after 4 doses (Winston, 2017). 
Unmet medical need 
Currently, Shingrix is indicated in adults ≥50 YOA, with no contraindication for use in the IC subjects. 
In support of the initial MAA, data from 2 Phase I/II clinical studies conducted in 135 adults ≥18 YOA, of 
whom 73 were ≥50 YOA, with autologous HSCT or HIV infection (studies ZOSTER-001 and ZOSTER-015, 
respectively) were provided showing that Shingrix was immunogenic and well-tolerated in IC subjects 
either by disease or treatment. A statement that there are limited data available on the use of Shingrix in 
IC adults ≥50 YOA is included in the section 4.4 ”Special warnings and precautions for use” of the SmPC 
with additional information in Pharmacodynamics section since at the time of the MAA, data were limited. 
There is also an unmet medical need in a wide range of adults ≥18 YOA at increased risk of HZ, i.e. 
individuals with underlying medical conditions or treatments predisposing them to HZ. This includes 
patients chronically using immunosuppressive medications (e.g., oncology patients and transplant 
recipients), patients with autoimmune diseases or other relevant chronic conditions (e.g., rheumatoid 
arthritis, IBD, COPD, cardiovascular diseases, renal disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, asthma, Type 
2 diabetes mellitus, HIV), as well as subjects with congenital immunodeficiencies. 
As described above, epidemiological evidence confirms that the risk of HZ increases in adults ≥18 YOA 
with those conditions, placing them at a risk comparable to and in many instances exceeding the risk 
seen in the general adult population ≥50 YOA. This wide spectrum of IC/conditions altering the immune 
status in adults illustrates the medical need for prevention through vaccination. 
Currently, Shingrix is indicated for prevention of HZ and PHN in adults ≥50 YOA. The MAH proposes to 
amend the indication for Shingrix to include adults 18 years of age or older at increased risk of HZ to 
address the unmet medical need for HZ prevention in that population.

The claimed indication is for prevention of herpes zoster (HZ) and post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in: 
- 
- 
adults 50 years of age or older. 
adults 18 years of age or older at increased risk of HZ. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
The GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA (GSK) adjuvanted (AS01B) Herpes zoster (HZ) vaccine, also referred 
to as HZ/su (su for ‘subunit’) has demonstrated >90% efficacy in preventing HZ in adults ≥50 YOA, 
including in the subpopulation of adults aged 70 years and older. Consequently it, has been approved 
under the tradename Shingrix in Canada, the United States (US), the European Economic Area (EEA), 
Japan, Australia and China. In all 6 countries/regions, Shingrix is indicated for prevention of HZ in adults 
≥50 years of age (YOA). In the EEA and Australia, Shingrix is also indicated for prevention of post-
herpetic neuralgia (PHN) in the same population. 
The vaccine is to be administered according to a 2-dose schedule, consisting of 2 injections given 2-6 
months apart. 
The glycoprotein E (gE) antigen contained in Shingrix is produced by recombinant DNA technology in 
Chinese Hamster Ovary cells and is provided in a lyophilized form (white powder) in monodose vials (50 
μg/dose). The AS01B (liquid) Adjuvant System, which is a GSK proprietary Adjuvant System, is provided 
in separate monodose vials (0.5 mL/dose). The content of the AS01B vial is used to reconstitute the 
content of the gE vial prior to intramuscular injection of Shingrix. 
The AS01B Adjuvant System contains 50 µg of each of the immune-enhancers Quillaja saponaria Molina 
fraction 21 (QS-21) and 3-O-desacyl-4’-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) combined with liposomes: 
-  QS-21 (licensed by GSK from Antigenics Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of Agenus Inc., a Delaware, 
US corporation) is a natural saponin molecule (triterpene glycoside) purified from the bark of Quillaja 
saponaria Molina tree. 
-  MPL (GSK North America, US) consists of a chemically detoxified form of the parent 
lipopolysaccharide from the Gram-negative bacterium Salmonella minnesota. 
- 
The liposomes consist of dioleoylphosphatidylcholine and cholesterol. 
The pharmaceutical form of the reconstituted vaccine is a liquid suspension for injection appearing 
opalescent, colorless to pale brownish. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
To support this extension of indication, the MAH executed a specific clinical development program (CDP) 
of 4 pivotal phase II/III clinical studies in adults ≥18 YOA with the following severe immunocompromising 
conditions: autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients (ZOSTER-002), hematologic 
malignancy patients (ZOSTER-039), renal transplant recipients (ZOSTER-041), and solid tumor patients 
(ZOSTER-028). In these studies, a total of 1,452 subjects received at least one dose of Shingrix. Shingrix 
has also been studied in two supportive phase I/II clinical studies (ZOSTER-001 and ZOSTER-015) in 135 
adults ≥18 YOA with autologous HSCT (N=61) or Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) infection (N=74). 
The data from these two studies were presented in the initial MAA. 
These studies were multi-country studies conducted worldwide. In all 4 pivotal studies, HZ/su was 
administered according to a 2-dose flexible schedule, with the second vaccine dose being administered 1 
to 2 months after the first dose. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 13/173 
 
 
  
  
In these studies, 1,452 IC subjects ≥18 YOA were exposed to at least one dose of Shingrix. 
The proposal for SmPC update was formally discussed with EMA at a CHMP Scientific Advice (SA) 
procedure (31 January 2019).  
The Company discussed with the Authorities at the time the following rationale for the proposed 
indication claim targeting the general population ≥18 YOA: 
The CHMP considered the rationale for extension of the indication as valid: ‘While the risk of HZ in 
otherwise healthy young adults is very low, this does not preclude an indication in adults ≥18 years of 
age, as the decision to use the vaccine is made based on recommendations of public health bodies and/or 
the clinical status of the individual’. 
It should be noted that the CHMP expressed a concern regarding the use of the adjuvant in the younger 
adult population: ‘Some further data on safety, and particularly local and systemic reactogenicity, from 
healthy young adults should be provided in any application to allow use from 18 years without any 
qualification. In the absence of this, available data may, subject to assessment, support an indication in 
immunocompromised patients from 18 years of age’. Based on this CHMP assessment, the Company 
proposes an extension of the indication to adults ≥18 YOA at increased risk of HZ. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The MAH claims that all trials were approved by Independent Ethics Committees (IECs) and conducted in 
accordance with the principles of Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and all applicable regulatory requirements, 
including the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects as per GCP 
requirements. Whenever potential issues with regard to the conduct of a study were identified, either via 
site monitoring activities or brought to GSK’s attention by other oversight mechanisms, these issues were 
investigated and appropriate corrective and where possible preventive actions were taken as considered 
appropriate for GCP and protocol compliance. 
All studies except ZOSTER-015 were audited by GSK’s R&D Global Quality Compliance-Clinical 
Development Quality Assurance (CDQA) department, and/or external Audit Groups who performed 
independent audits on behalf of GSK. 
According to the MAH, there were no significant audit findings that impacted the validity of the data 
collected. The MAH also claims that during the conduct of the all the studies, there were no significant 
deviations from GCP compliance identified by the MAH, with the exception of two relevant audit findings 
which occurred in ZOSTER-002 are described below. The MAH considers that there is no impact on the 
validity of the data. 
During the conduct of ZOSTER-002, important GCP issues related to lack of evidence of Principal 
Investigator oversight and documentation deficiencies were detected and investigated during 2 for-cause 
audits of ZOSTER-002. The internal audits were conducted by GSK: (i) At one United Kingdom site. This 
site enrolled 5 out of the 1846 subjects included in the study; (ii) At one site in New Zealand. This site 
enrolled 3 out of the 1846 subjects included in the study. There was no evidence of impact on the validity 
of the data. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
The GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals SA (GSK) adjuvanted (AS01B) Herpes zoswter (HZ) vaccine, also referred 
to  as  HZ/su  (su  for  ‘subunit’)  and  gE/AS01B  (research  code),  has  been  approved  under  the  tradename 
Shingrix in Canada, the United States (US), the European Economic Area (EEA), Japan, Australia and China. 
One dose of HZ/su contains 50 μg of gE, as active ingredient, adjuvanted with AS01B including 50 μg of 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 14/173 
 
 
  
  
each immunoenhancer [3-O-desacyl-4’-monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) and Quillaja saponaria Molina fraction 
21 (QS-21)] formulated in liposomes [1000 μg dioleoyl phosphatidylcholine (DOPC) and 250μg cholesterol 
by dose]. 
With this application the Company aims to extend the indication of Shingrix to adults ≥18 YOA in order to 
address  the  unmet  medical  need  for  HZ  prevention  in  adults  at  increased  risk  of  HZ  due  to  an 
immunodeficiency or immunosuppression caused by disease or underlying therapy. 
The  dossier  for  Marketing  Authorization  Application  (MAA)/  Biologics  License  Application  (BLA)  included 
nonclinical  pharmacology  and  toxicity  studies  conducted  with  gE/AS01B  that  were  complemented  by 
nonclinical pharmacology, biodistribution and toxicity studies with the AS01B Adjuvant System as well as 
with the QS-21 and MPL immunoenhancer components of this Adjuvant System family. In particular, toxicity 
studies that were conducted with the gE/AS01B, AS01B alone, MPL and QS-21 were included. Nonclinical 
development  followed  guidelines  that  were  in  effect  at  the  time  of  study  conception  and  conduct  which 
included:  CPMP  Note  for  Guidance  on  preclinical,  pharmacological  and  toxicological  testing  of  vaccines 
(CPMP/SWP/465/95), 
the 
Guideline 
on 
adjuvants 
in 
vaccines 
for 
human 
use 
EMEA/CHMP/VEG/134716/2004),  the  WHO  Guidelines  on  the  nonclinical  evaluation  of  vaccine  adjuvants 
and adjuvanted vaccines (WHO, 2013), the FDA Guidance for Industry: Considerations for Developmental 
Toxicity Studies for Preventive and Therapeutic Vaccines for Infectious Disease Indications (FDA, 2006) and 
the WHO Guideline on Nonclinical Evaluation of Vaccines (WHO, 2005). 
The HZ/su vaccine candidate and the AS01B formulation were tested at the highest used clinical dose 
(“full human dose”) in alignment with above mentioned guidelines. QS-21 (and MPL) were tested at doses 
greater than the full human dose in agreement with ICH harmonised tripartite guideline: detection of 
toxicity to reproduction. For medicinal products & toxicity to male fertility S5(R2). Current Step 4 version, 
parent Guideline dated 24 June 1993 (Addendum dated 9 November 2000 incorporated in November 
2005). 
The proposed extended indication would include women of childbearing potential. Of note, reproductive 
toxicity studies were included in the initial submission even though they were not relevant for the target 
population in the original indication (≥ 50 years of age). The CHMP raised concerns regarding the 
reproductive toxicity, specifically after administration of QS-21. The conclusion on the adjuvant 
component QS-21 was that it potentially induces treatment related adverse findings including kidney and 
great blood vessel malformations in rabbits but not in rats, at doses considered sufficiently in excess over 
the therapeutic dose to not raise concern. The CHMP recommended that, in case of extension of the 
target population to women of childbearing potential, the Company should consider testing the 
vaccine/adjuvant system in a second species in an embryo-fetal development (EFD) study. 
Following the recommendations of CHMP, an additional reproductive toxicity study that would provide 
new data on potential effects of AS01 in rabbits has been performed and submitted with this application. 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
This assessment pertains to the submitted results from the developmental and reproductive toxicity 
(DART) study after administration of AS01B in rabbits as well as additional background data allowing 
interpretation of malformations that occurred in rabbits after administration of QS-21 (Table 3).

2.2.2.  Toxicology 
Reproduction toxicity 
Reproductive toxicity studies submitted in the original MAA 
The EPAR for Shingrix (EMA/88588/2018) summarizes the available reproductive toxicity studies (please 
refer to section 2.3.4 Toxicology – Reproduction studies).   
In order to support this EOI, that will include women of childbearing potential, the MAH has submitted a 
developmental toxicity study (including teratogenicity and postnatal investigations) of RSVPreF3 or 
ASO1B by intramuscular injection in rabbits. 
Developmental toxicity study (including teratogenicity and postnatal investigations) of 
RSVPreF3 or ASO1B by intramuscular injection in rabbits (study number 20152506, GLP) 
The objectives of this study were to detect adverse effects of RSVPreF3 vaccine or AS01B (not part of the 
RSVPreF3 vaccine) on fertility, EFD and early postnatal development in female pregnant NZW rabbits. One 
group of rabbits received a viral antigen (RSVPreF3) that is not relevant for the assessment of effects of 
gE/AS01 or AS01B; however, the group can serve as control and results can be informative for the overall 
interpretation of the study. 
To this end, 3 groups of 48 rabbits received RSVPReF3, AS01B or control article formulation at the dose 
levels shown in the table below by intramuscular injection in the morning hours on DS1 (28 days prior to 
mating), DS15 (14 days prior to mating), on GD3, GD11, GD16 and GD24 and after natural delivery on 
LD7  (as  applicable,  see  treatment  schedule  below).    From  the  48  rabbits  per  group,  24  animals  were 
allocated  either  to  the  caesarean  section  cohort  or  to  the  natural  delivery  cohort,  based  on  computer-
generated randomisation scheme balanced by body weights. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 16/173 
 
 
  
  
 
Table 4: Overview of the developmental toxicity study 20152506 
The  dose  of  AS01B  in  0.5  mL  was  selected  because  it  is  the  highest  clinical  dose  used  for  the  licensed 
Shingrix vaccine and other vaccine candidates in development.  Unless otherwise noted, study rabbits were 
euthanized on GD 29 (caesarean section cohort) or LD 35 (natural delivery cohort). 
During  the  study,  clinical  condition,  bodyweight,  food  consumption,  gestation  length  and  parturition 
observations,  and  macroscopic  pathology  investigations  were  recorded  for  F0 females.  Fetuses  from the 
embryo-fetal phase of the study were examined macroscopically at necropsy and subsequently by detailed 
internal  visceral  examination  or  skeletal  examination.  For  offspring  in  the  postnatal  phase  of  the  study, 
clinical condition and survival, sex ratio, bodyweight, pre-weaning reflex development and macropathology 
observations were recorded. 
Mortality 
There were no treatment-related deaths. Three rabbits in the AS01B group were found dead on GD 31, 
LD 28, and LD 30. 
The cause of death was not apparent for the 3 found dead animals. The incidence of mortality during the 
gestation phase (1 female out of 24 died on GD 31) is within the historical control data (HCD) range for 
this type of study. Upon review of the scientific literature, it is reported that female rabbits in the last 
week of pregnancy and the first week of lactation have higher mortality rates than nonpregnant females 
[Rosell, 2016]. In the 2 rabbits that were found dead at the end of the lactation period, there were body 
weight losses and food consumption decrease within the week of being found dead. HCD collected during 
the prenatal and embryofetal development stages (HCD for the post-partum lactation period is not 
available) show that incidental maternal toxicity has occurred at a range of 0- 2 does/group. No literature 
was identified describing the incidence of maternal mortality during the later postpartum phase, however, 
mortality in conjunction with reduced food intake and indigestion has been reported [Harcourt-Brown, 
2002; McInnes, 2012], as well as other conditions in periparturient does that are linked to anorexia and 
mortality [Rosell, 2016]. 
Based on the weight of evidence and the inconsistency between the previous dose and the time of death 
(7-23 days), these deaths were considered incidental and unlikely related to AS01B. 
Embryofetal survival, fetal weight and gravid uterine weight 
No  treatment  related  effects  on  numbers  of  corpora  lutea,  implantations,  resporptions,  live  and  dead 
foetuses per litter, sex ratio, fetal body weight, gravid uterine weight or placental morphology. 
The mean number of live fetuses/litter was slightly lower in the AS01B group (7.7) vs controls (8.3) but 
was  not  considered  treatment-related  as  it  was  not  statistically  significant  and  within  historical  control 
(mean 8.8, range 7.0-10.1). Also, the post-implantation loss was slightly higher in AS01B groups vs controls 
(4.23 vs control value of 2.02) but was not considered treatment-related as not statistically significant, nor 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 17/173 
 
 
  
  
 
did this higher postimplantation loss translate to lower numbers of live fetuses/litter and both were within 
historical control ranges for this laboratory, mean of 3.5, range of 0.8-22.9. 
Fetal examinations C-section cohort 
In the AS01B group, one fetus had a small eye and one multiply malformed fetus (domed head, hindlimbs 
malrotated, protruding tongue, distended abdomen, brain misshapen, small lungs, bent long bones 
(humerus/radius/ulna/femur/ tibia/fibula/metatarsal, and frontal/mandible/supraoccipital misshapen) was 
noted in a different litter.  
In controls, there were 3 fetuses in 1 litter with large adrenal glands (also 2 other foetuses in this same 
litter had supernumerary lumbar vertebrae), 2 fetuses in 1 litter with fused thoracic centrum (one of 
these fetuses also had a branched rib, the other fetus had a fused thoracic arch). 
Fetuses with malformations occurred in all groups including controls. All malformations and variations 
that were observed were considered unrelated to treatment because: 1) the abnormality was limited to a 
single fetus; 2) the abnormality occurred at a similar incidence in the control group; and/or 3) the litter 
and/or fetal incidence was within the range of the historical control data for the Testing Facility. 
There were no treatment-related effects on natural delivery or litter observations. 
Values for the numbers of does delivering litters, the duration of gestation, averages for implantation 
sites per delivered litter, does with stillborn and liveborn kits, the gestation index (number of does with 
one or more liveborn kits/number of pregnant rabbits), dams with all kits dying, kits found dead or 
presumed cannibalized, viability and lactation indices, surviving kits per litter, percentage of male kits per 
litter, live litter size at weighing, and kit weights per litter were all comparable among the groups 
including controls. 
In the F1 generation, there were no treatment-related clinical signs or effects on reflex and physical 
development, macroscopic observations at scheduled euthanasia and brain weights. Early deaths of kits 
and the number of surviving kits/litter were comparable across 3 dose groups; therefore, the early deaths 
were not considered treatment related. 
In conclusion, intramuscular injection of female rabbits with the full human dose of AS01B, 28 and 14 
days before pairing, on gestation days 3, 11, 16, and 24, and on day 7 of lactation, was well tolerated. 
AS01B produced no adverse effects on female fertility, embryo-fetal or pre- and post-natal survival, 
growth or development of the offspring up to Day 35 of age. 
Additional background data 
The Applicant provided new background data in this submission that support that the findings observed in 
foetuses of female rabbits administered QS-21 at a high dose (200 μg/animal) in one developmental and 
reproductive toxicity study (AB14898) are background findings and not evidence of QS-21-mediated 
foetal damage. 
These data are summarized as follows: 
- In study AB14898, IM administration of QS-21 at 200 μg/animal/occasion to rabbits 28 and 14 days 
before the start of mating and on gestation days 3, 8, 11, 15 and 24 and on day 7 of lactation induced a 
significant maternal mean body weight loss associated with reduced mean food consumption at the end of 
the gestation period which is interpreted as minimal maternal toxicity consistent with expectations of ICH 
S5(R2) for the dose setting of the high dose group and related to this, lower mean foetal weight was 
noted at this dose level. Based on the absence of findings in the mid dose level, the NOAEL was 
considered to be a dose of 100 μg/rabbit (corresponding to 30 μg /kg BW considering a BW of 3.3 kg for 
rabbits). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 18/173 
 
 
  
  
Other DART studies that were conducted in rats or rabbits with test articles that contained QS-21 did not 
reveal evidence of developmental toxicity in rats (HEY0005, HEY0020, Segal, 2017) or rabbits 
(20152506). Doses used in those studies overlapped when calculated on a bodyweight basis. 
- In order to consider a developmental toxicity signal as test-article related, a distinct embryologic 
abnormality needs to occur at a higher incidence than the background incidence and the abnormality 
needs to be consistent between foetuses. The malformations that occurred more than once in the high 
dose group of study AB14898 were (i) malpositioned and/ or malformed kidneys, and (ii) “great vessels 
malformations”. The former findings were genetically linked to one male and both malformations fall 
within the reported historical background as evidenced by information from the Contract Research 
Organization provided in this submission (AB14898 accessory document -1,3,4). The likelihood of 
clustered malformations within one dose group was enhanced by a mating scheme that linked a limited 
number of males to one dose group, rather than allowing mating across dose groups (AB14898 accessory 
document -2). 
- An incidental accumulation of findings in one dose group has been observed in historical control data 
(HCD), the highest number of affected litters were comparable to the 6 litters observed for study 
AB14898 (4 litters in HCD 2010-2012 –AB14898 Pre clinical study report, 5 litters in HCD 2014-2016- 
AB14898 accessory document -3 and 6 litters in HCD 2016-2017- AB14898 accessory document -4). 
2.2.3.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
As mentioned in the scope of EMA’s “Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal 
products for human use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr1, 1 June 2006), inactivated vaccines, such as 
Shingrix, are exempted from an environmental risk assessment due to the nature of their constituents. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The new developmental toxicity study (including teratogenicity and postnatal investigations) of ASO1B by 
intramuscular injection in rabbits and the additional information provided in this application support the 
conclusion that there is no safety concern with regards to female fertility, embryo-fetal or pre- and post-
natal survival, growth or development of the offspring, after administration of gE/AS01B, AS01B, QS-21 
in rats and after administration of AS01B, QS-21 in rabbits, under the conditions of the respective 
studies.  
Findings  in  the  low  dose  group  (20  µg  of  QS-21),  including  malpositioned  kidneys,  great  vessel 
malformation  and  total  litter  losses,  may  be  considered  incidental  based  on  the  historical  control  data 
provided by the Applicant. Based on the absence of findings in study AB14898 in the mid dose level, the 
NOAEL for QS-21 was set at a dose of 100 μg/rabbit (corresponding to 30 μg /kg BW considering a BW of 
3.3 kg for rabbits). As direct comparison to human doses is not possible given the particular experimental 
design  of  reproductive  toxicity  studies  for  vaccines,  repeated  dosing  of  a  full human  dose in  absence  of 
adverse findings is considered an acceptable safety margin. Adverse findings in previous studies were not 
observed in the new developmental toxicity study (including teratogenicity and postnatal investigations) of 
ASO1B by intramuscular injection in rabbits. 
2.2.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of Herpes zoster vaccine (recombinant, adjuvanted).  
From a non-clinical point of view, this type II variation application is considered acceptable.

Design 
Pivotal Studies 
One Phase II/III study and three Phase III studies support the HZ/su application in adults ≥18 YOA at 
increased risk of HZ: 
•  ZOSTER-002 evaluated the efficacy, immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of HZ/su in 
autologous HSCT recipients ≥18 YOA. 
•  ZOSTER-028 evaluated the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of HZ/su in adults ≥18 YOA 
with solid tumors and receiving chemotherapy. 
•  ZOSTER-039 evaluated the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of HZ/su in adults ≥18 YOA 
with hematologic malignancies who were vaccinated during a cancer therapy course or after the full 
cancer therapy course. 
•  ZOSTER-041 evaluated the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of HZ/su in renal transplant 
recipients ≥18 YOA. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 23/173 
 
 
  
  
 
These were multi-country studies conducted worldwide. In all 4 pivotal studies, HZ/su was administered 
according to a 2-dose flexible schedule, with the second vaccine dose being administered 1 to 2 months 
after the first dose. 
Supportive Studies 
In addition, 2 Phase I/II studies in adults ≥18 YOA with autologous HSCT (ZOSTER-001) and HIV infection 
(ZOSTER-015) support the schedule selection in the IC CDP and the extension of indication. 
•  ZOSTER-015 evaluated the immunogenicity, reactogenicity and safety of HZ/su in HIV infected 
adults ≥18 YOA and provides additional safety and immunogenicity data in support of the proposed 
indication. 
•  ZOSTER-001 evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of HZ/su when administered as 2 doses or 3 
doses, and supported the selection of the 2-dose schedule of HZ/su for use in the Phase II/III studies 
in IC populations. 
Study populations: 
Study populations of ZOSTER-002 and ZOSTER-039 are described in detail in the clinical efficacy section. 
Study populations of ZOSTER-028 and ZOSTER-041 are described below in this section.  
Blinding: 
The studies were conducted in an observer-blind manner because the HZ/su and Placebo vaccines 
differed in their preparation method and appearance. Therefore, HZ/su and Placebo were prepared and 
administered only by authorized medical personnel not involved in any of the clinical study evaluation 
assays. The blinding was maintained until study end. Of note for ZOSTER-015, the investigators and 
investigative staff could have become aware of treatment allocation (inadvertent unblinding) with respect 
to some data included in the Month 7 CSR. 
Randomization and treatment allocation: 
All studies were conducted in a randomized manner. Treatment allocation for eligible subjects at the 
study site was performed using a central randomization system on the internet (SBIR) based on a 
minimization algorithm. Randomization was performed using several minimization factors aiming to 
ensure comparability of baseline characteristics between the two study groups. A randomization list was 
generated at GSK using a SAS program and was used to number the vaccines. A treatment number 
uniquely identified the vaccine dose to be administered to a subject. The vaccine doses were distributed 
to each study center, respecting the randomization block size. 
In ZOSTER-028, subjects were stratified to the PreChemo group (first vaccination 8-30 days prior to the 
start of a chemotherapy cycle) or the OnChemo group (first vaccination at the start of a chemotherapy 
cycle) according to a 4:1 ratio. In both groups, the second vaccination was administered 1 to 2 months 
after the first vaccination and on the first day of a subsequent chemotherapy cycle. 
Treatments: 
In the pivotal studies, the vaccine was administered IM according to a flexible schedule, with the second 
vaccine dose being administered 1 to 2 months after the first dose. The standard route was IM injection 
in the deltoid of the non-dominant arm. 
All the studies used the final selected HZ/su formulation, i.e. 50 µg gE adjuvanted with AS01B. 
Throughout this report, the GSK HZ vaccine is referred to as either Shingrix or HZ/su. Note that in 
ZOSTER-015, the vaccine has been referred to as gE/AS01B. 
In ZOSTER-015, 3 vaccine doses were administered IM according to a 0, 2, 6-months schedule. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 24/173 
 
 
  
  
In all studies, the control group received placebo injections (lyophilized sucrose reconstituted with saline 
[NaCl] solution). 
Study duration: 
All subjects in the studies (except ZOSTER-001) were followed up for at least 12 months post last 
vaccination. In ZOSTER-002, the median follow-up for safety and efficacy was approximately 29 months 
and 21 months, respectively. In ZOSTER-028, ZOSTER-039 and ZOSTER-041, the study duration for each 
subject was 13 to 15 months. In ZOSTER-015, the study duration was approximately 18 months. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic studies including bioavailability and bioequivalence studies are usually not required for 
vaccines (EMA guidelines, EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/2005, EMEA/CHMP/VEG/134716/2004).  
Pharmacokinetic studies were not conducted during the clinical development of the candidate vaccine 
which was deemed acceptable at the initial MAA. 
2.3.3.  Immunogenicity  
Mechanism of action 
By combining the VZV specific antigen (gE) with an adjuvant system (AS01B), Shingrix is designed to 
induce antigen-specific cellular and humoral immune responses in individuals with pre-existing immunity 
against VZV. 
Non-clinical data show that AS01B induces a local and transient activation of the innate immune system 
through specific molecular pathways. This facilitates the recruitment and activation of antigen presenting 
cells carrying gE-derived antigens in the draining lymph node, which in turn leads to the generation of 
gE-specific CD4+ T cells and antibodies. The adjuvant effect of AS01B is the result of interactions 
between MPL and QS-21 formulated in liposomes. 
Immunogenicity Objectives and Endpoints 
In ZOSTER-028, ZOSTER-039 and ZOSTER-041, with respect to primary and secondary confirmatory 
immunogenicity objectives, a hierarchical procedure was applied to control for Type I error. The 
objectives were assessed sequentially in order of ascending rank until an objective was not met. At this 
point, the evaluation proceeded with descriptive analyses of the remaining objectives. In ZOSTER-002, all 
immunogenicity objectives were non-confirmatory.

For confirmatory immunogenicity objectives, success criteria were defined for: 
•  Humoral responses (ZOSTER-028, ZOSTER -039, and ZOSTER-041) 
(i) 
Vaccine response rate (VRR): The objective was met if the lower limit (LL) of the 95% 
confidence interval (CI) of the VRR for anti-gE enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) 
antibody (Ab) concentrations at Month 2 in the HZ/su vaccine group was at least 60%. 
(ii) 
Geometric mean (GM) ratio: The objective was met if the LL of the 95% CI of the GM ratio 
(HZ/su over placebo) for anti-gE ELISA antibody concentrations at Month 2 was greater than 
3. 
•  Cellular responses (ZOSTER-028 and ZOSTER-041) 
(i) 
VRR: The objective was met if the lower limit of the 95% CI of the VRR for gE-specific CD4+ 
T-cell frequencies at Month 2 in the HZ/su vaccine group is at least 50%. 
(ii) 
GM ratio (ZOSTER-028 for PreChemo group): The objective was met if the LL of the 95% CI 
of the GM ratio (HZ/su over placebo) in gE-specific CD4+ T-cell frequencies at Month 2 is 
greater than 1. 
Results expression 
•  Humoral immunogenicity 
Depending on the assays performed in each study, results were expressed in term of: 
•  Seropositivity rate with exact 95% CI, i.e., percentage of subjects with Ab concentration ≥assay 
cut-off value. 
•  GMC with 95% CI. 
•  VRR with exact 95% CI, i.e., percentage of subjects who had at least a 4-fold increase in the post 
Dose 2 anti-gE Ab concentration as compared to pre-vaccination anti-gE Ab concentration for 
subjects who were seropositive at baseline, or a 4-fold increase in the post Dose 2 anti-gE Ab 
concentration as compared to the anti-gE Ab cut-off value for seropositivity for subjects who were 
seronegative at baseline. 
•  Descriptive statistics of the fold increase over pre-vaccination (Mean, standard deviation [SD], 
Min, Q1, Median, Q3, Max). 
•  Cellular immunogenicity 
Depending on the assays performed in each study, results were expressed in term of:

•  VRR with exact 95% CI, i.e., a ≥2-fold increase in the frequency of CD4[2+] T-cells as compared 
to pre-vaccination frequencies (for subjects with pre-vaccination CD4[2+] T-cell ≥320 per 106 
CD4 T-cells), or ≥2-fold increase as compared to the threshold of 320 per 106 CD4 T-cells (for 
subjects with pre-vaccination frequencies below the threshold). 
•  Descriptive statistics of the frequency of CD4[2+] T-cells (Mean, SD, Min, Q1, Median, Q3, Max). 
•  Descriptive statistics of the fold increase over pre-vaccination of gE-specific CD4[2+] T-cells 
(Mean, SD, Min, Q1, Median, Q3, Max). 
Immunogenicity analysis (pivotal trials) 
For all pivotal studies, the primary immunogenicity analysis was based on the according to protocol (ATP) 
cohort for humoral immunogenicity or CMI, as appropriate and the primary persistence analysis was 
based on the ATP cohort for humoral or CMI persistence, as appropriate. 
The concept of ‘Adapted ATP cohort for immunogenicity’ was used to denote that for each timepoint, 
the corresponding ATP cohort for immunogenicity/ATP cohort for persistence was used. 
When the percentage of subjects excluded from either of these ATP cohorts (for Humoral Immunogenicity 
and for CMI) was greater than 5% in any treatment group, a second analysis based on the total 
vaccinated cohort (TVC) was performed to complement the ATP analysis. 
In ZOSTER-028 and ZOSTER-039 studies, a first analysis of immunogenicity was performed on available 
data up to and including Month 2 (active phase), while the End of Study (EoS) analysis was performed 
when all study data up to and including Month 13 were available. Unless specified, results obtained during 
the active phase were similar to those obtained at the end of study. 
Inferential analysis 
Humoral immunogenicity 
To evaluate anti-gE humoral immune responses at Month 2 following a 2-dose administration of HZ/su as 
compared to Placebo, a repeated measures model was used to assess the geometric mean concentration 
(GMC) fold increase over Placebo at Month 2. 
For ZOSTER-028, ZOSTER-039 and ZOSTER-041, the model was used to assess the confirmatory 
objectives in terms of anti-gE humoral immune responses. The fixed-effect model included the visit by 
treatment interaction. Additionally, the model also included the first vaccination schedule 
(OnChemo/PreChemo) to assess the secondary confirmatory objective in ZOSTER-028 (in all subjects), 
and it included the underlying disease (“CLL” and “MM and other diseases”) to assess the secondary 
confirmatory objective in ZOSTER-039 (in subjects with hematologic malignancies excluding subjects with 
NHBCL). 
In ZOSTER-002, the analysis was an exploratory group comparison, and the fixed-effect model included 
treatment, and adjusted for age strata and underlying diseases (“MM” and “Other diagnoses, including 
NHBCL, Hodgkin Lymphoma, NHTCL, AML, solid organ malignancies, etc.”). 
A likelihood-based approach was used to analyze post-vaccination log-transformed anti-gE Ab 
concentrations (Month 1 to Month 2). The pre-vaccination log-transformed Ab concentration (Month 0) 
was included as a continuous covariate. Adjusted means and difference of means between HZ/su and 
Placebo were calculated together with 2-sided CIs and back-transformed to the original units to provide 
GMCs and GMC ratios over Placebo. 
Cell-mediated immunogenicity 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 27/173 
 
 
  
  
The evaluation of the CMI responses at Month 2 following a 2-dose administration of HZ/su as compared 
to Placebo was performed in terms of gE-specific CD4[2+] T-cells, defined as CD4 T-cells producing 
≥2 activation markers from among IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α, and CD40L. 
Geometric Means (GMs) for gE-specific CD4[2+] T-cells were calculated. These estimates better represent 
the net effect of the vaccines over the frequency of CD4[2+] T-cells as caused by the vaccine. The same 
model as described above was used to analyse the log-transformed ratio between induction frequency 
and background frequency of CD4[2+] T-cells. Least-squares means and difference of least-squares 
means were then back-transformed and used to provide estimates for the frequency difference divided by 
background ([induction-background] / background). The log-transformed ratios of these estimates 
between treatments were calculated together with CIs according to the Delta method (error propagation 
method). The CIs were calculated on the log scale and then back-transformed to the original units. 
Descriptive analysis 
The descriptive analyses performed to assess humoral immune responses and CMI responses in the 
pivotal studies were performed for the entire study population and by age stratum (18-49 YOA and ≥50 
YOA). In addition, the following subgroup analyses were performed: by underlying disease (ZOSTER-002 
and ZOSTER-039), by detailed underlying disease (ZOSTER-002), by duration between the first dose and 
the start of chemotherapy cycle (PreChemo/OnChemo, only humoral immunogenicity in ZOSTER-028), by 
timing of vaccination in relation to cancer therapy cycle (ZOSTER-039), and by type of 
immunosuppressive (IS) therapy (only humoral immunogenicity in ZOSTER-041). 
Assays used to evaluate immunogenicity 
All Phase I, II and III clinical studies with HZ/su evaluated vaccine-induced humoral immune responses 
measured by the ELISA, and CMI responses measured by Intracellular Cytokine Staining (ICS) (Table 7). 
All assays were validated for their used in the pivotal trials.

b The timing of this blood sampling was variable, depending on the subject’s chemotherapy schedule and also on when vaccination 
was started in relation to their chemotherapeutic regimen. Blood sampling was to occur within Months 4 to 13, i.e., at the start of the 
last cycle of chemotherapy (if at least 2 months after the previous blood sampling at Month 2). 
c CD4+ T-cells expressing at least 2 activation markers from among IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF- α and CD40L. 
Serological Assay: Anti-gE ELISA 
Principle 
Anti-gE  Ab  concentrations  were  measured  using  an  anti-gE  ELISA,  which  allowed  quantitative 
measurement of the humoral immune response induced by HZ/su. Serially diluted blood serum samples of 
subjects  were  added  to  microtiter  wells  pre-coated  with  VZV  gE  recombinant  antigen.  Secondary 
peroxidase-conjugated anti-human Abs were added, which bound to the primary human anti-gE Abs. After 
incubation of the microtiter wells with a chromogen substrate solution, the enzymatic reaction was stopped. 
Optical densities were recorded and anti-gE Ab concentrations were calculated from a standard curve. In 
February 2014, the assay cut-off was changed following additional validation experiments from 18 mIU/mL 
(used in ZOSTER-015) to 97 mIU/mL (used in the Phase II/III studies). The assay was performed on human 
serum at GSK’s laboratory or another laboratory designated by GSK. 
Validation 
The validation documents of the assay used to measure anti-gE Ab in samples from the supportive and 
the pivotal studies were already submitted at the MAA, with the exception of the document

Assay to evaluate CMI: gE ICS 
Principle 
Measurements of CMI responses were performed on thawed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 
by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) by a laboratory designated by GSK. 
The  gE  ICS  assay  measures  the  frequency  of  gE-specific  CD4+  T-cells  in  vitro.  This  assay  provided 
information on the CD4+ T-cell concentration responding to culture medium or antigens (pool of overlapping 
peptides covering the entire sequence of the vaccine antigen gE) by producing activation markers involved 
in immunity such as IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α, and CD40L. 
PBMCs isolated from whole blood samples of subjects were stimulated for 2 hours using culture medium 
(for  evaluation  of  the  nonspecific  response),  or  with  a  pool  of  overlapping  peptides  covering  the  entire 
sequence of the vaccine antigen gE. Then, an intracellular block (brefeldin A) was added to inhibit activation 
marker  secretion  for  a  subsequent  overnight  incubation.  Cells  were  then  harvested,  stained  for  surface 
markers  (CD3,  CD4  and  CD8)  and  fixed.  The  fixed  cells  were  then  permeabilized  and  stained  with 
antiactivation marker Abs, washed and analyzed by cytofluorometry to detect IFN-γ, IL-2, TNF-α or CD40L. 
Results are expressed in frequency of antigen-specific polypositive CD4+ T cells / 106 CD4+ T cells (where 
polypositive means a cell expressing at least two out of the four evaluated activation markers, CD4[2+]) 
after background subtraction. 
Validation 
The qualified assay method used in studies ZOSTER-001 and ZOSTER-015 was further validated for its 
used in the 4 pivotal studies.

Since the MAA, complement of validation for linearity and precision in the low range of response were 
performed, as recommended by CBER.  
Precision experiments were performed on CMV clinical study or healthy donor samples (n=19) stimulated 
by a CMV gB pool of peptides. The choice of this antigen was guided by samples availability. CV ≤ 40% 
was used as validity criterion. Based on the results (n=342), the lower limit of precision (LLOP) was set at 
a frequency of 354 polypositive CD4+ T cells / 106 CD4+ T cells. 
To evaluate the linearity focusing in the low gE-specific responses, stimulated PBMC of 3 samples (from 
study ZOSTER -003) were diluted in autologous non-stimulated PBMC using seven fractional dilutions, 
resulting in samples with target responses around 2000 (undiluted), 1000, 800, 600, 500, 400, 300, and 
200 polypositive CD4+ T cells / 106 CD4+ T cells. Linearity was assumed if the 95% CI of the predicted 
DLi (deviation from linearity) was within the acceptance limits [0.50-2.00]. The observed DLis were 
obtained by dividing the corrected frequencies by the geometric mean of the frequencies observed for the 
non-diluted samples. Based on these three samples of low-specific gE responses, the lower limit of 
linearity (LLOL) was set at a frequency of 159 polypositive CD4+ T cells / 106 CD4+ T cells. 
The lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) was therefore set at 354 polypositive CD4+ T cells / 106 CD4+ T 
cells for the ICS assay. 
Based on the duplicates of the background values from the samples used for the precision evaluation, a 
cut-off of the assay has been set at 183 (percentile 95 of the distribution of delta background values). 
Given that LLOL is below the cut-off, the assay is considered linear over the whole range from the cut-off 
up to the highest response evaluated.  
The analytical range is determined from 183 (cut-off value) to 100000 (based on the literature) specific 
CD4+ T cells / 106 CD4+ T cells. 
To ensure that issues occurring during the PBMCs preparation process do not interfere with assay results, 
a quality criterion has been set on PBMC viability upon thawing, which should be above 80%. 
Standard operating procedures 
SOP underwent various changes between the ICS of supportive study samples (SOP CLABSOP 046) and 
of pivotal study samples (SOP CLABSOP064 v4).  Major changes are :  
• 
• 
Flow cytometer: FACSCANTO replaced by LSRII 
Fully adapted to 8 colors : add of a Live & dead marker and anti-human CD3 Ab (AF-700, clone 
UCHT1) 
•  Anti-human CD8 APC-Cy7 moAb replaced by anti-human CD8 APC-H7 moAb both being clone SK1  
•  Add of control on each run, on each plate. 
•  Details on live & dead marker preparation. 
Dose response studies 
The dose used was identical than the one used for immunocompetent subjects. Data supporting this 
choice was already submitted at initial MA (studies ZOSTER-001 and ZOSTER-015) and are briefly 
described under the section Supporting studies. 
A flexible 2-dose schedule, with the second dose being administered 1 to 2 months after the first, was 
selected based on the results of study ZOSTER-001 (see section Supportive studies).

Study design and population are described in detail in Section 2.4.1 Clinical Efficacy. 
Both humoral and cellular immune responses to the study vaccine were evaluated in a sub-cohort of 
subjects before vaccination (Month 0, Visit 1), one to two months post-dose 1 (Month 1, Visit 2), one 
month post-dose 2 (Month 2, Visit 3), and approximately 12 (Month 13, Visit 4) and 24 (Month 25, Visit 
5) months post-dose 2. There was always a flexibility on the time intervals between visits, i.e. 30-60 days 
Visit 1 -> Visit 2, 30-48 days Visit 2 -> Visit 3, 335-425 days Visit 2 -> Visit 4, and 670-790 days Visit 2 
-> Visit 5. The CMI sub-cohort was a subgroup of the Humoral Immunogenicity sub-cohort.  
Anti-gE Ab concentrations were also determined at Month 0 and at Month 2, in all subjects with confirmed 
HZ and compared with matched controls for CoP assessment. Other assays may also be performed for 
this analysis, if deemed appropriate. Details regarding the CoP assessment and results are planned to be 
presented in a future report. 
The primary analysis was based on the ATP cohort for analysis of humoral or CMI immunogenicity. 
Further analysis were conducted by age strata (18-49 YOA, ≥50 YOA) and by underlying diseases. 
Results 
1.  Immunogenicity study population  
There were 82 (out of 101, TVC for humoral immunogenicity) of the HZ/su group and 76 (out of 100, TVC 
for humoral immunogenicity) subjects of the Placebo group included in the ATP cohort for Humoral 
immunogenicity.  
The ATP cohort for Humoral persistence at Month 13 included 54 subjects in the HZ/su and 47 subjects in 
the Placebo group, and, at Month 25, 39 subjects in the HZ/su and 30 subjects in the Placebo group.  
There were 59 (out of 71, TVC for CMI immunogenicity) of the HZ/su group and 55 (out of 70, TVC for 
CMI immunogenicity) subjects of the Placebo group included in the ATP cohort for CMI. 
The ATP cohort for CMI persistence at Month 13 included 42 subjects in the HZ/su and 35 subjects in the 
Placebo group, and, at Month 25, 35 subjects in the HZ/su and 23 subjects in the Placebo group. 
The main reasons for exclusion were occurrence of a confirmed HZ episode or out of the blood sampling 
interval allowed for inclusion. 
Table 8 summarizes the demographic characteristics for ATP cohort for humoral immunogenicity, which 
are overall representative of those of the TVC, of the CMI immunogenicity, and of those when stratified 
by age strata or by underlying diseases (multiple myeloma (MM) and other diagnoses). The mean age 
was 54.2 years and 56.5 years for the HZ/su and Placebo groups, and more male than female subjects 
were included in both groups. Percentages of subjects with geographical ancestry appeared to be overall 
similar in the HZ/su and Placebo groups.

The median duration in days post-transplant to first was 61.0 for both HZ/su and placebo subjects 
(mTVC). The distribution of subjects receiving/not receiving IS treatment (classified by IS ingredient 
subclass) at least on day prior to HSCT up to blood sample 1 month post-dose 2 was similar between 
both groups (mTVC). The following ingredient subclasses of IS treatment were most frequently 
administered (by >20% of subjects in the HZ/su group): nitrogen and mustard analogues (96.3%), 
topoisomerase inhibitors (38.4%), pyrimidine analogues (33.1%) and nitrosoureas (32.0%). Post-
transplant antineoplastic therapy with bortezomib was included as a separate minimization category 
because of the well-documented increased risk of HZ in persons treated with bortezomib. 
2.  Anti-gE specific humoral immune response 
Overall, in autologous HCT recipients ≥18 YOA a strong anti-gE Ab response was elicited following a two 
dose-schedule of HZ/su (Month 2). From all timepoints evaluated, the highest immune responses were 
observed one month post-dose 2. The anti-gE Ab responses decreased one year post-dose 2 (Month 13) 
but persisted above pre-vaccination levels for up to two years post-dose 2 (Month 25) (Table 9).

Post-vaccination Dose II (Month 13); PII(M25) = Post-vaccination Dose II (Month 25) 
In the HZ/su group, the MGI over pre-vaccination was 2.49 (95% CI: 1.78 – 3.49), 16.72 (95% CI: 
10.01 – 27.92), 4.51 (95% CI: 2.58 – 7.89) and 4.35 (95% CI: 1.89 – 9.99) at Months 1, 2, 13 and 25,

respectively. In the Placebo group, the MGI over pre-vaccination was not higher than 0.93 at any 
timepoint. 
The highest VRR for anti-gE Ab concentrations was also observed one month post-dose 2 (67.1%, 95% 
CI 55.8-77.1). VRRs for anti-gE Ab concentrations at Months 13 (40.4%, 95% CI 27.0-54.9) and 25 
(44.7%, 95% CI 28.6-61.7) were comparable. In the placebo group, it was not higher than 14.8% at any 
timepoint. 
Adjusted GMs of anti-gE Ab concentrations at one month post-dose 2 were 11227.7 (95% CI:6769.6-
18621.7) and 520.7 (95% CI:470.0-577.0) for HZ/su and placebo groups respectively, and the ratio for 
HZ/su group over Placebo group was 21.56 (95% CI: 12.91 – 36.01). 
The results obtained for the 18-49 YOA and ≥50 YOA strata consistently showed high anti-gE immune 
responses in the HZ/su group that remained above pre-vaccination levels up to two years post-dose 2 
(Table 10). The highest VRR for anti-gE Ab concentrations was also observed one month post-dose 2 for 
both groups (18-49 YOA: 57.7%, 95%CI 36.9-76.6 and ≥50 YOA: 71.4%, 95%CI 57.8-82.7). VRRs for 
anti-gE Ab concentrations at Months 13 and 25 were quite comparable. In the placebo group, it was not 
higher than 22.2 and 11.1% at any timepoint in the 18-49 YOA and ≥50 YOA strata, respectively.

The results of the TVC analyses, overall, were consistent with the results of the ATP analyses. 
3.  gE-specific CMI 
Overall, in autologous HSCT recipients ≥18 YOA, gE-specific CMI responses were observed following two 
doses of HZ/su at one month post-dose 2 (Month 2). The highest immune responses were observed at 
one month post-dose 2; the observed gE-specific CMI responses were lower one year post-dose 2 (Month 
13) but persisted relative to pre-vaccination levels up to two years post-dose 2 (Month 25). In the 
Placebo group, at all timepoints the observed median frequency of gE-specific CD4[2+] T-cells remained 
at pre-vaccination levels (Table 13).

In the HZ/su group, the observed median (min - max) fold increase over pre-vaccination in the frequency 
of gE-specific CD4[2+] T-cells was 8.2 (0.0 – 3486.5), 109.0 (0.0 – 24677.3), 43.6 (0.0 – 7502.6) and 
50.9 (0.3 – 3126.4) at Months 1, 2, 13 and 25. 
In the HZ/su group, the VRR in the frequency of gE-specific CD4[2+] T-cells was 46.3% (95% CI: 30.7% 
- 62.6%), 92.9% (95% CI: 80.5% - 98.5%), 70.4% (95% CI: 49.8% - 86.2%) and 70.8% (95% CI: 
48.9% - 87.4%) at Months 1, 2, 13 and 25. In the Placebo group, the VRR in the frequency of gE-specific 
CD4[2+] T-cells (point estimate) was not higher than 12.5% at any timepoint. 
The results obtained in the 18-49 YOA and ≥50 YOA strata consistently showed in the HZ/su group gE-
specific CMI responses above pre-vaccination levels at one month post-dose 2 (Month 2) that persisted 
relative to pre-vaccination levels up to two years post-dose 2 (Month 25) (Table 14).

ZOSTER-028 
Study design and population. 
The focus of the ZOSTER-028 was to examine the immunological response to HZ/su, when subjects were 
immunocompromised through the use of chemotherapy. Enrolled subjects were adults who had been 
diagnosed with one or more solid tumours (defined as a solid malignancy, i.e., not a blood element 
malignancy) and would receive or were receiving a cytotoxic or IS chemotherapy (such that 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 37/173 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
investigational product could be administered no later than the start of the second cycle of 
chemotherapy). Subjects receiving only newer, more targeted therapies without a classical IC 
chemotherapy were not to be included. In addition, a chemotherapy course <28 days before first 
vaccination and chronic/planned administration of systemic glucocorticoids between 1 month prior to and 
2 months post first vaccination were not allowed. The first vaccine dose was to be administered at least 8 
days (up to 1 month) before the administration of a chemotherapy cycle (PreChemo group) or at the start 
of a chemotherapy cycle (OnChemo group). 
Both humoral and cellular immune responses to the study vaccine were evaluated in subjects before 
vaccination (Month 0, Visit 1), one to two months post-dose 1 (Month 1, Visit 2, at the second dose 
administration and at the first day of a subsequent cycle of chemotherapy) and one month post-dose 2 
(Month 2, Visit 3), within 4 to 13 months post-dose 1 (Month 6, visit 4, at the start of the last cycle of 
chemotherapy which coincided with the subject’s lowest immune status) and approximately 12 months 
after the second dose of study vaccine/placebo (Month 13, Visit 5). The timing of this particular Visit 4 
was variable depending on the subject’s chemotherapy schedule and also on when they started 
vaccination in relation to their chemotherapeutic regimen. Dependent on the timing of Visit 4, it could 
coincide with Visit 5. The allowed interval between vaccinations for inclusion in the ATP cohort was 
defined as 30-84 days (Visit 1->Visit 2). The allowed interval between dose 2 and blood sample at Visit 3 
was defined as 21-63 days. The allowed interval between dose 2 and blood sample at Visit 5 was defined 
as 335-425 days. 
Humoral Immunogenicity was performed on all subjects of the PreChemo and OnChemo groups. The CMI 
sub-cohort comprised exclusively of subjects from the PreChemo Groups. This was a subgroup of the 
subjects in the study in selected countries at designated sites that had access to a PBMCs processing 
facility within the acceptable time window from sample collection to PBMC processing. CMI was not 
evaluated at visit 4. 
The primary analysis of humoral and cellular immunogenicity were based on the ATP cohort for 
immunogenicity/persistence. Further analysis were conducted by PreChemo and OnChemo groups as well 
as by age strata (18-49 YOA, ≥50 YOA). 
The immune ATP cohort analysis was based on the allowed intervals for and Visit 2->Visit 3.  
Results 
1.  Immunogenicity study population  
Out of the 117 and 115 subjects included in the TVC in the HZ/su group and Placebo group respectively, 
87 (PreChemo, n=65; OnChemo, n=22) and 98 (PreChemo, n=78; OnChemo, n=20) subjects were 
included in the ATP cohort for Humoral immunogenicity in the HZ/su and Placebo group respectively. 
Sixty-eight (PreChemo, n=51; OnChemo, n=17) and 70 (PreChemo, n=56; OnChemo, n=14) subjects 
were included in the ATP cohort for Humoral persistence in the HZ/su and Placebo group respectively.  
Number of subjects excluded per reason was generally well balanced between groups with the exception 
of the number of subjects whom did not receive the second vaccine dose, i.e. 17 subjects in the HZ/su 
group and 5 subjects in the Placebo group. Immunogenicity data at month 2 was lacking for a slightly 
higher proportion of subjects in the HZ/su group compared to the placebo group. 
Only subjects from the PreChemo group were included in the CMI sub-cohort. The TVC for the CMI 
immunogenicity included 39 and 37 subjects in the HZ/su group and Placebo group respectively. The ATP 
cohort for CMI immunogenicity included 27 and 31 subjects in the HZ/su and Placebo group respectively. 
Twenty subjects in the HZ/su group and 20 subjects in the Placebo group were included in the ATP cohort 
for CMI persistence. Consistently with the humoral immunogenicity cohort, 8 subjects in the HZ/su group,

did not receive the second dose and immunogenicity data at Month 2 were absent for 7 subjects in the 
HZ/su group and 3 subjects in the Placebo group. 
Because of the small sample size of the PreChemo group tested for immunogenicity, results should be 
interpreted with caution. 
The mean age was 55.5 and 57.0 years for the HZ/su and Placebo group respectively. More female than 
male subjects were included (65.5% and 61.2% female in the HZ/su and Placebo group, respectively). 
The most frequently reported solid tumor diagnoses in the ATP cohort for humoral immunogenicity were 
breast cancer (51.4%), colorectal cancer (21.1%), and other types of solid tumors (15.1%). The 
performance status (ECOG) of most subjects (83.0%) was fully active. 
Gender distribution slightly differed for the TVC cohort CMI immunogenicity as well the proportion of 
several solid tumour organs. This difference in tumours distribution was also observed between PreChemo 
and OnChemo groups, between 18-49YOA and ≥50YOA groups, and for TVC.

antimicrotubule agents (26.4%). 
2.  Anti-gE specific humoral immune response  
Confirmatory analyses 
The primary and the first secondary confirmatory objectives were related to the PreChemo group and 
were met; The anti-gE Ab GM ratio (HZ/su PreChemo Group over Placebo PreChemo group) at Month 2 
was 23.2 (95% CI: 17.9–30.0, p<0.0001) and the anti-gE Ab VRR (in the HZ/su PreChemo group) at 
Month 2 was 93.8% (95% CI: 85.0–98.3). 
Since the third confirmatory secondary objective was not met (see point 3, gE-specific CMI), according to 
the hierarchical procedure applied, the following objectives were analysed descriptively.  
The anti-gE humoral immune response at Month 2 in the HZ/su group compared to the Placebo group (all 
subjects), the observed adjusted GM ratio was 14.4 (95% CI: 10.7 – 19.5). 
The VRR in anti-gE humoral immune response at Month 2 (post second vaccination) in the HZ/su group 
(all subjects) was 86.2 % (95% CI: 77.1– 92.7). 
Descriptive analyses  
Anti-gE humoral immune responses relative to pre-vaccination levels were observed in the HZ/su group 
at 1 month following the first and second dose and persisted up to 1 year post-dose 2, relative to the pre-
vaccination level (Table 17).

PII(M6) = Post-vaccination Dose II (Month 6); PII(M13) = Post-vaccination Dose II (Month 13) 
VRRs in the HZ/su group at Month 1 and Month 2 were 85.9% (95% CI: 76.6 – 92.5) and 86.2% (95% 
CI: 77.1 – 92.7) respectively, and at Month 13, 51.5% (95% CI: 39.0 – 63.8). In the Placebo group, 
there were no subjects meeting the definition of responder at Months 1, 2 and 13. 
Anti-gE humoral immune responses were observed in the HZ/su PreChemo and HZ/su OnChemo groups 1 
month post first vaccination and 1 month post second vaccination. Persistence of humoral

immunogenicity at 1 year post second vaccination was also observed in HZ/su subjects and appeared to 
be similar for PreChemo and OnChemo groups despite the different administration schedules of each 
group (Table 18).

vaccination Dose II (Month 2); PII(M6) = Post-vaccination Dose II (Month 6); PII(M13) = Post-vaccination Dose II (Month 13) 
In line with these results, VRRs in the HZ/su PreChemo group at Month 1 and Month 2 were 93.8% (95% 
CI: 84.8 – 98.3) and 93.8% (95% CI: 85.0 – 98.3) respectively, and at Month 6 and Month 13, 75.0% 
(95% CI: 56.6 – 88.5) and 52.9% (95% CI: 38.5 – 67.1) respectively. VRRs in the HZ/su OnChemo 
group at Month 1 and Month 2 were 61.9% (95% CI:38.4 – 81.9) and 63.6% (95% CI: 40.7 – 82.8) 
respectively, and at Months 6 and Month 13, 70.0% (95% CI: 34.8 – 93.3) and 47.1% (95% CI: 23.0 – 
72.2) respectively. In the Placebo PreChemo group, there were no subjects meeting the definition of 
responder at Months 1, 2 and 13. In the Placebo OnChemo group, there was 1 subject meeting the 
definition of responder but only at Month 6. 
Comparable immune responses for both age strata were observed 1 month post first and 1 month post 
second vaccination up to 1 year post dose 2 (Table 19).

Regarding the 18-49 YOA stratum, VRRs in the HZ/su group both at Month 1 and Month 2 were 85.2% 
(95% CI: 66.3 – 95.8) and at Month 6 and Month 13, 68.8% (95% CI: 41.3 – 89.0) and 45.5% (95% CI: 
24.4 – 67.8) respectively. Regarding the ≥ 50 YOA stratum, VRRs in the HZ/su group at Month 1  and 
Month 2 were 86.2% (95% CI: 74.6 – 93.9) and 86.7% (95% CI: 75.4 – 94.1) respectively, and at 
Month 6 and Month 13, 76.9% (95% CI: 56.4 – 91.0) and 54.3% (95% CI: 39.0 – 69.1) respectively. In 
the Placebo group for both age strata, there were no subjects meeting the definition of responder, except 
for 1 subject at Month 6 in the 18-49 YOA stratum. 
Anti-gE analysed by age strata in PreChemo groups only were overall comparable. 
Results of the analyses performed on the TVC were consistent with results of the analyses performed on 
the ATP cohort for Humoral immunogenicity and the ATP cohort for Humoral persistence. 
3.  gE-specific CMI 
Confirmatory analyses 
In contrast to the humoral results, the active phase results on CMI generated at first analysis and at end 
of study were not the same, secondary to changes in the lab CMI data release definitions allowing more 
CMI data release, even so there was no impact on study conclusions.

The second confirmatory secondary objective was related to the PreChemo group and was met; The anti-
gE Ab GM ratio (HZ/su PreChemo Group over Placebo PreChemo group) at Month 2 was 13.67 (95% CI: 
3.79–49.38, p=0.0002). Descriptive results obtained with the end of study analysis indicates that the 
observed GM ratio at Month 2 was 9.94 (95% CI: 3.63 – 27.19). 
The third confirmatory secondary objective of the study was not met as the lower limit of the 95% CI of 
the VRR for gE-specific CD4[2+] T-cell frequencies in the HZ/su PreChemo group (at Month 2 (post 
second vaccination) was 33.5%. Therefore, the success criterion (at least 50%) was not demonstrated. 
The observed VRR was 57.9% (95% CI: 33.5 – 79.7). Descriptive results obtained with the end of study 
analysis indicated that the observed VRR at Month 2 was 50.0% (95% CI: 28.2 – 71.8). 
Descriptive analyses  
gE-specific CMI responses to HZ/su in the PreChemo group were above pre-vaccination levels 1 month 
after the first vaccination; stronger immune responses were observed 1 month after the second dose. 
Additionally, the persistence of gE-specific CMI at 1 year post-dose 2 in PreChemo HZ/su subjects was 
observed (Table 20).

The PreChemo 18-49YOA subgroups included 9 subjects which is too small for results interpretation. 
Results of the analyses performed on the TVC were consistent with results of the analyses performed on 
the ATP cohort for CMI immunogenicity and the ATP cohort for CMI persistence. 
Zoster-039 
Study design and population are described in detail in Section 2.1.1 Clinical Efficacy. 
Both humoral and cellular immune responses to the study vaccine were evaluated in all subjects 
(serology) or a sub-cohort (CMI) before vaccination (Month 0, Visit 1), one to 2 month post-dose 1 
(Month 1, Visit 2), one month post-dose 2 (Month 2, Visit 3), and 12 (Month 13, Visit 4) months post-
dose 2. There were always a flexibility on the time intervals between visits, i.e. 30-60 days Visit 1 -> Visit 
2, 30-48 days Visit 2 -> Visit 3, 335-425 days Visit 2 -> Visit 4. 
The assessment of correlation of HZ/su vaccine-induced humoral immune responses with protection 
against HZ was also included in the objectives of the study. Serology results of Visits 1 and 3 of subjects 
having experienced a HZ episode or be selected as a case control for this purpose (See efficacy section).

Subjects with NHBCL and CLL were excluded from the analyses for the primary humoral immunogenicity 
endpoint (anti-gE HI at Month 2), and subjects with NHBCL from those for the secondary humoral 
immunogenicity endpoint. 
Further descriptive analysis was performed by treatment group and by age strata (n=2, 18-49 YOA, ≥50 
YOA), underlying diseases (n= 3, NHBCL; CLL; Multiple Myeloma, Non-Hodgkin T-cell Lymphoma, 
Hodgkin Lymphoma and Other Hematologic Malignancies) and timing of vaccination in relation to the 
particular immunosuppressive cancer therapy cycle (n=2, vaccination during cancer therapy course and 
vaccination after the full cancer therapy course). 
Results 
1.  Immunogenicity study population 
Out of the 283 and 279 subjects included in the TVC in the HZ/su and Placebo groups, respectively, 217 
and 198 subjects were included in this ATP cohort and 168 and 142 subjects were included in the ATP 
cohort for Humoral persistence. 
Out of the 90 and 84 subjects of the CMI sub-cohort in the HZ/su and Placebo groups, respectively, 69 
and 63 subjects were included in the ATP cohort for CMI and 54 and 46 subjects were included in the ATP 
cohort for CMI persistence. 
Reasons for exclusions were comparable between groups. 
Table 21 summaries the demographic characteristics for ATP cohort for humoral immunogenicity. The 
mean age of participants at first vaccination was 57.2 years. The gender distribution was 58.8% males 
and 41.2% females, and the majority of the subjects (71.3%) were White-Caucasian/of European 
heritage. The ECOG performance status of subjects in the ATP cohort for humoral immunogenicity was 
fully active for 65.7% of subjects and restricted in physically strenuous activity for 32.6% of subjects. In 
this cohort, reported hematologic malignancies included MM (22.7%), other hematological malignancies 
(21.0%), Hodgkin Lymphoma (18.8%), CLL (17.1%), NHBCL (15.9%) and NHTCL (4.6%). Of the 
subjects in the HZ/su group, 32.0% were vaccinated during IS cancer therapy, while 68·0% were 
vaccinated after the end of the cancer therapy. 
Overall, these characteristics were similar to those of CMI immunogenicity, except for the proportion of 
subjects classified by haematological malignancies and by performance status ECOG (Table 22). The 
proportion of M/F also slightly differ. Demographic characteristics for ATP cohort for humoral 
immunogenicity are representative of those of the TVC.

Demographic characteristics by age strata were different than for the overall ATP cohort for humoral 
immunogenicity. Due to the limited number of subjects by age strata, percentages of the different 
underlying diseases were different and not always balanced between age groups. Some imbalanced in 
gender distribution and in geographic ancestry between HZ/su and placebo groups were observed when 
analysed by haematological malignancies.  
2.  Anti-gE specific humoral immune response  
Confirmatory analyses 
The primary confirmatory objectives were assessed on the ATP cohort for humoral immunogenicity, 
excluding subjects with NHBCL and CLL, and were met; The anti-gE Ab VRR at Month 2 was 80.4% (95% 
CI: 73.1–86.5) and the anti-gE Ab adjusted GM ratio (vaccinees/placebo) at Month 2 was 29.75 (95% CI: 
21.09–41.96). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

The secondary confirmatory objectives were assessed on the ATP cohort for humoral immunogenicity, 
excluding subjects with NHBCL, and were met; The anti-gE Ab VRR at Month 2 was 69.0% (95% CI: 
61.8–75.6) and the anti-gE Ab adjusted GM ratio at Month 2 was 9.02 (95% CI: 6.18–13.17). 
Descriptive analyses  
Descriptive analyses were performed on the adapted ATP cohort for humoral immunogenicity for all study 
subjects. 
Overall, Anti-gE humoral immune responses were observed in the HZ/su group at 1 month following the 
first dose, with further increase after the second dose and persisted through 1 year post-dose 2 above 
pre-vaccination levels (Table 23).

The VRR in the HZ/su group was 44.2%, 65.4% and 52.1% at Months 1, 2 and 13, respectively. In the 
Placebo group, the VRR for anti-gE Ab concentrations was not higher than 3.6% at any timepoint. 
Even if the stratified analyses, after HZ/su administration, anti-gE humoral immune responses showed a 
similar pattern as in the general population (i.e. a response was observed 1 month following the first 
dose, with further increase after the second dose and persisted through 1 year post-dose 2, above pre-
vaccination levels), differences in Ab titers between strata were observed (Table 24, Table 25, and Table 
26). 
Within the HZ/su group, there is a trend towards a higher anti-gE humoral immune response in the 
18–49 YOA than the ≥50 YOA age strata Table 24.

Accordingly, VRRs in the HZ/su group within the 18–49 YOA and ≥50 YOA strata at Month 1 were 50.8% 
and 41.7%; at Month 2 were 72.9% and 62.7% and at Month 13 were 61.4% and 48.8%, respectively. 
Within the HZ/su group, there is a trend towards a higher anti-gE humoral immune response in the

Within the HZ/su group, there is a trend towards a higher anti-gE humoral immune response in subjects 
vaccinated after completion of immunosuppressive cancer therapy than in subjects vaccinated 
during the cancer therapy course (Table 26).

39.1% and 46.6%; at Month 2 were 53.6% and 70.9% and at Month 13 were 42.6% and 55.9%, 
respectively. 
Results of the analyses performed on the TVC were consistent with results of the analyses performed on 
the ATP cohort for Humoral immunogenicity and the ATP cohort for Humoral persistence. 
3.  gE-specific CMI 
The gE-specific CMI responses were observed in the HZ/su group at 1 month following the first dose, with 
further increase 1 month after the second dose and persisted through 1year post-dose 2 above pre-
vaccination levels (Table 27).

The VRR of the frequency of gE-specific CD4[2+] T-cells in the HZ/su group, at Months 1, 2 and 13 were 
37.5%, 83.7% and 66.7%, respectively. 
Descriptive analysis results performed on subjects with hematologic malignancies excluding subjects with 
NHBCL and CLL in the CMI sub-cohort were similar; At Month 2, the adjusted GM frequency of gE-specific 
CD4[2+] T-cells in the HZ/su group was 2740.4 (95% CI: 1787.6–4123.7) and the VRR was 73.7% (95% 
CI: 48.8% - 90.9%). 
These results were confirmed by the descriptive statistics of the frequency of gE-specific CD4[2+] T-cells 
by underlying disease (Table 28).

persistence. 
ZOSTER-041 
Study design and population. 
The study population was adults ≥ 18 YOA with renal transplant and on chronic immunosuppressive (IS) 
therapy for the prevention of allograft rejection for a minimum of 30 days prior to first vaccination. 
The ABO compatible allogeneic renal transplant (allograft) was to be received not less than 4 months 
(120 days) and not more than 18 months (547 days) before the time of the first vaccination. Eligible 
subjects had transitioned to and were receiving stable (unchanging) chronic IS for the maintenance of the 
allograft (prevention of rejection) for a minimum of one month (30 days) prior to the first vaccination. 
The subjects had to be without any episode of allograft rejection over the previous three months (90 
days) prior to the first vaccination and with stable renal function. Subjects had to have multiple dialysis 
options (peritoneal and/or more than one anatomical access site for haemodialysis) in the event that 
acute or chronic dialysis was needed. Subjects suffering from any recurring primary kidney disease or 
with more than one organ transplanted were excluded. Subjects with increased risk for chronic allograft 
dysfunction, histologic reports of chronic allograft injury, significant proteinuria, panel reactive antibody 
score unknown at the time of transplant, systemic autoimmune or pIMD, except those localized to kidney 
and those with diabetes mellitus with diabetic nephropathy, were also excluded. Subjects with confirmed 
or suspected human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), primary immunodeficiency disease, disseminated or 
untreated malignancy, or systemic infection were excluded as well. Subjects could not have been treated 
with anti-CD20 or other B-cell monoclonal antibody agents for prevention of allograft rejection within 9 
months (274 days) of first study vaccination. Subjects who had previous HZ or varicella or vaccination

against HZ or varicella within the 12 months preceding the first dose of study vaccine/placebo were also 
excluded. 
Humoral immune response to the study vaccine was evaluated in all subjects before vaccination (Month 
0, Visit 1), one to 2 month post-dose 1 (Month 1, Visit 2), one month post-dose 2 (Month 2, Visit 3), and 
at 6 (Month 7, Visit 4) and 12 (Month 13, Visit 5) months post-dose 2. CMI was evaluated in a sub-cohort 
at Visit 1, 3, and 5. There were always a flexibility on the time intervals between visits, i.e. 30-60 days 
Visit 1 -> Visit 2, 30-48 days Visit 2 -> Visit 3, 152-212 days Visit 2 -> Visit 4, 335-425 days Visit 2 -> 
Visit 5. 
The analyses of humoral and cellular immunogenicity and persistence were performed on all subjects or 
all subjects in the CMI sub-cohort within the ATP cohorts for humoral or for CMI immunogenicity (at 
Months 0, 1, and 2) and persistence (at Months 7 and 13), respectively. Further descriptive analysis was 
performed by treatment group and by age strata. 
Results 
1.  Immunogenicity study population 
The TVC included a total of 264 subjects; 132 in each of the study groups. The ATP cohort for Humoral 
immunogenicity included 121 subjects in the HZ/su and 119 subjects in the Placebo group. The ATP 
cohort for Humoral persistence at Month 7 included 110 subjects in the HZ/su and 115 subjects in the 
Placebo group, and, at Month 13, 111 subjects in each of study groups. 
Of the 38 HZ/su and 40 placebo recipients in the TVC for CMI analysis, 36 subjects from each of the 
study groups remained in the CMI sub-cohort. 36 HZ/su and 33 placebo recipients remained in the sub-
cohort for CMI persistence. 
Reasons for exclusions were comparable between groups with the exception of higher proportion of non 
compliance with blood sampling schedule for the HZ/su group. 
Demographic characteristics for ATP cohort for humoral immunogenicity are representative of those of the 
TVC (Table 30). The mean age was 52.5 years (51.9 years for the HZ/su and 53.1 years for the Placebo 
group). More male, than female, subjects were included in the ATP cohort for Humoral immunogenicity 
(71.1% of male subjects in the HZ/su and 70.6% in the Placebo group). Regarding the geographic 
ancestry, most of the subjects (69.2%) were of Caucasian/European ancestry. 
Demographic characteristics of CMI immunogenicity slightly differ, including for proportion of F/M in the 
HZ/su group (19.4% and 80.6% respectively) and geographic ancestry (>90% in both groups). This was 
because the CMI sub-cohort was restricted to designated sites in selected countries that had access to 
PBMC processing facility (Table 31).

Demographic characteristics by age strata (18-49 YOA and ≥ 50 YOA) also slightly differ for F/M ratio (for 
stratum 18-49YOA, and strata CIS) and proportion of geographic ancestry compared with those of ATP 
cohort for humoral immunogenicity but were well balanced within each stratum.  
Subjects were divided into 3 groups by type of maintenance IS therapy in use at Day 0 (i.e., 
mycophenolate compound [MC], calcineurin inhibitors/sirolimus [CIS], or corticosteroids [CS]): 92 and 91 
subjects in the HZ/su and Placebo group, respectively received CIS+CS+MC; respectively 21 and 20 
subjects received CIS+MC; and respectively 6 and 8 subjects received CIS+CS.  
Demographic characteristics by type of IS therapy (CIS+MC+CS, CIS+MC, and CIS+CS) indicated some 
imbalanced for these characteristics within strata CIS+MC and CIS+CS. 
2. Anti-gE specific humoral immune response  
Confirmatory analyses 
The primary confirmatory objective was assessed in all subjects in the ATP cohort for Humoral 
immunogenicity and was met; The anti-gE Ab VRR at Month 2 was 80.2% (95% CI: 71.9–86.9) 
The secondary confirmatory objective was assessed on the ATP cohort for humoral immunogenicity and 
was met; The anti-gE Ab GM ratio at Month 2 was 14.0 (95% CI: 10.9 –17.99). 
Descriptive analyses  
Overall, Anti-gE humoral immune responses were observed in the HZ/su group at 1 month following the 
first dose, with further increase after the second dose and persisted through 1 year post-dose 2 above 
pre-vaccination levels (Table 32).

The VRR in the HZ/su group was 63.6%, 80.2%, 75.5% and 66.7% at Months 1, 2, 7 and 13, 
respectively. In the Placebo group, the VRR for anti-gE Ab concentrations was not higher than 6.4% at 
any timepoint. 
Although, after HZ/su administration, anti-gE humoral immune responses showed a similar pattern as in 
the general population (i.e. a response was observed 1 month following the first dose, with further 
increase after the second dose and persisted through 1 year post-dose 2, above pre-vaccination levels), 
differences in Ab titers between strata were observed, for both age strata (Table 33) and IS therapy 
(Table 34).  Ab concentrations measured at any timepoint for the 18-49 YOA Placebo group were always 
slightly higher than for the >50YOA Placebo group. A trend for higher anti-gE Ab GMC were observed in 
patients under CIS+MC when compared to those under CIS+CS+MC.

Results of the VRR by age strata were consistent with GMC results 
- For the 18-49 YOA stratum, VRR in the HZ/su group was 73.9%, 84.8%, 80.5% and 70.7% at Months 
1, 2, 7 and 13, respectively. In the Placebo group, the VRR for anti-gE Ab concentrations was not higher 
than 7.7% at any timepoint.  
- For the >50 YOA stratum, VRR in the HZ/su group was 57.3%, 77.3%, 72.5% and 64.3% at Months 1, 
2, 7 and 13, respectively. In the Placebo group, the VRR for anti-gE Ab concentrations was not higher 
than 5.7% at any timepoint.

Post-hoc analysis confirmed the trend for higher induced-Ab responses with younger age (based on the 
GMCs and VRR results obtained for the 18-29 and 30-49 YOA strata). 
Results of the VRR by IS therapy were consistent with GMC results 
- For the CIS+CS+MC stratum, VRR in the HZ/su group was 58.7%, 77.2%, 72.6% and 62.7% at Months 
1, 2, 7 and 13, respectively. In the Placebo group, the VRR for anti-gE Ab concentrations was not higher 
than 8.2% at any timepoint.  
- For the CIS+MC stratum, VRR in the HZ/su group was 76.2%, 90.5%, 89.5% and 75.0% at Months 1, 
2, 7 and 13, respectively. In the Placebo group, the VRR for anti-gE Ab concentrations was not higher 
than 5.0% at any timepoint. 
Because of the low number of subjects included in the CIS+CS stratum, data were not evaluated. 
Results of the analyses performed on the TVC were consistent with results of the analyses performed on 
the ATP cohort for Humoral immunogenicity and the ATP cohort for Humoral persistence. 
3.  gE-specific CMI 
Confirmatory analysis 
The third confirmatory, secondary objective was assessed in the CMI sub-cohort on the ATP cohort for 
CMI and was met; The VRR for gE-specific CD4[2+] T-cell frequencies in the HZ/su group at Month 2 was 
71.4% (95% CI: 51.3–86.8). 
The fourth confirmatory, secondary objective of the study was also met; the GM ratio (HZ/su group over 
Placebo group) in gE-specific CD4[2+] Tcell frequencies at Month 2 was 17.26 (95% CI: 5.92 – 50.36, P 
<0.0001). 
Descriptive analyses  
Descriptive analyses results were performed on adapted ATP cohort for CMI sub-cohort (Table 35). 
Specific CD4 T cells were detected after vaccination and decreased with time.

results; SD = Standard Deviation; Q1,Q3 = First and third quartiles;Min/Max = Minimum/Maximum; PRE = Pre-vaccination (Month 0); 
PII(M2) = Post-vaccination Dose II (Month 2); PII(M13) = Post-vaccination Dose II (Month 13) 
The VRR of the frequency of gE-specific CD4[2+] T-cells in the HZ/su group, at Months 2 and 13 were 
71.4% and 56.7%, respectively. In the Placebo group, no subject met the definition of responder at any 
timepoint. 
CMI results by age strata showed a trend for lower CMI in the >50YOA stratum when compared to the 
younger stratum (Table 36).

Similarly, than for the humoral immune responses, results of the analyses performed on the TVC were 
consistent with results of the analyses performed on the ATP cohort for CMI and the ATP cohort for CMI 
persistence. 
Supportive studies 
Shingrix has also been studied in two supportive phase I/II clinical studies (ZOSTER-001 and ZOSTER-
015) in 135 adults ≥18 YOA with autologous HSCT (N=61) or Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) 
infection (N=74). The data from these two studies were presented in the MAA. Both studies support the 
schedule selection in the immunocompromised (IC) clinical development plan (CDP) and the extension of 
indication. Relevant data are summarized below. 
Zoster-001 
ZOSTER-001 was a Phase I/IIa randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study that 
evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of HZ/su (gE/AS01B), in comparison to gE/AS01E (50 μg gE 
combined with half dose AS01B adjuvant) and to Placebo when administered IM as 2 doses or 3 doses. 
Eligible subjects were patients ≥18 YOA who underwent autologous HCT within the past 50-70 days for 
treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma (T or B cell), myeloma or Acute Myeloid 
Leukemia (AML), and for who there are no plans for additional HCTs. 
A total of 120 subjects were randomized into the following 4 groups: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
gE/AS01B 3-dose group: 3 doses of HZ/su at Months 0, 1, and 3 (30 subjects) 
gE/AS01E 3-dose group: 3 doses of gE/AS01E at Months 0, 1, and 3 (29 subjects) 
gE/AS01B 2-dose group: 1 dose of Placebo at Month 0 and 2 doses of HZ/su at Months 1 and 3 (31 
subjects) 
Placebo group: 3 doses of Placebo at Months 0, 1, and 3 (30 subjects) 
As part of the primary and secondary objectives, gE-specific humoral immune responses and CMI 
responses were evaluated at different time points. Both analyses were performed by treatment group and 
are summarized below (Table 37,Table 38 and Table 39).

studies in IC populations. 
Besides, the study groups in ZOSTER-001 that assessed a 3-dose and a 2-dose schedule of HZ/su were 
initiated at different time points after transplant, with the 3-dose schedule initiated 50-70 days after 
transplant and the 2-dose schedule initiated 1 month thereafter. Based on these results, an early 
initiation of vaccination, with the first dose given 50-70 days after autologous HSCT was chosen for 
ZOSTER-002. 
Zoster-015 
Zoster-015 was a Phase I/IIa randomized, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, multi-country 
study evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of HZ/su when administered IM as 3 doses to HIV-
infected adults ≥18 YOA.  
Three cohorts of HIV-infected subjects were enrolled (n=123): 
•  ART High CD4 cohort (ARTHCD4, n=94): ART-treated subjects with a CD4 T cell count: ≥200 
cells/mm3. 
•  ART Low CD4 cohort (ARTLCD4, n=14): ART-treated subjects with a CD4 T cell count: 50-199 
cells/mm3. 
•  Non-ART High CD4 cohort (NARTHCD, n=15): ART-naïve HIV-infected subjects with a CD4 T cell 
count of ≥500 cells/mm3. 
Seventy-four of them were in the HZ/su group and 49 in the Placebo group. The ATP cohorts for 
immunogenicity consisted in 54 vaccinated (ARTHCD4 n=44, ARTLCD4 n=5, NARTCD n=5) and 37 
placebo subjects (ARTHCD4 n=30, ARTLCD4 n=3, NARTCD n=4).  
For the ART High CD4 and ART Low CD4 cohorts, subjects were to be stable on ART for at least 1 year, 
have a CD4 T-cell count ≥50 cells/mm3 at screening, and have an undetectable VL (i.e. < 40 copies/mL, 
based on the cut-off of the HIV VL test used) at screening.

At Visit 1, eligible subjects were allocated (3/2) to two parallel treatment groups (i.e., gE/AS01B and 
Placebo group, respectively).  The gE/AS01B group received a dose of vaccine at Month 0, Month 2 and 
Month 6.  
Specific humoral and cellular immune responses were evaluated one month post-final vaccination (Month 
7) (primary objective) in addition to diverse timepoints up to 12 months post-final vaccination (secondary 
objectives). 
Anti-gE Ab titers and frequencies of gE-specific CD4 T cells by time points are summarized in Table 40

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
1. Introduction 
At the moment, Shingrix is indicated in adults aged above 50 years to prevent Herpes Zoster and PHN. 
Immuncompromised persons were addressed in the “warning section” of the SmPC. There was an unmet 
medical need for adults with immunosuppressed condition with increased risk of Herpes Zoster. 
The MAH conducted 4 pivotal studies and 2 supportive studies in various immunocompromised (IC) adult 
populations. There is a large variety of IC population, and it was therefore not possible to study each 
population. The MAH selected the studied populations based on their high risk of VZV reactivation. The 
inclusion of these patient groups in the clinical trials deemed acceptable as representatives for 
immunocompromised subjects. 
ZOSTER-001 (supportive) and ZOSTER-002 (pivotal) studies included autologous HCT recipients, study 
ZOSTER-015 (supportive) HIV-infected adults, study ZOSTER-028 (pivotal) adults with solid tumors and 
receiving chemotherapy, study ZOSTER-039 (pivotal) adults with hematologic malignancies who were 
vaccinated during a cancer therapy course or after the full cancer therapy course, and study ZOSTER-041 
(pivotal) renal transplant recipients.  
Patients were receiving various immunosuppressive (IS) or immunomodulating treatments to treat their 
underlying diseases, before, during or after the vaccination, that could interfere with the vaccine 
response. Depending of the underlying disease, the treatment (type and duration) and the timing of the 
vaccination, elicitation of gE-specific CD4 T cells and/or anti-gE Ab titers (as well as other immune cells 
not investigated) could be differently affected. 
In study ZOSTER-002, only subjects who underwent autologous HCT within 50-70 days prior vaccination 
were eligible. This delay between transplant and vaccination was based on results of study ZOSTER-001. 
One month after the first vaccine dose, relatively similar anti-gE GMCs and frequencies of specific CD4 T 
cells were measured when vaccination occurred 50-70 days or 80-100 days after autologous HCT. 
Serology results were similar post-dose 2. An early vaccination post-transplant might be beneficial to this 
at risk population. The choice of this vaccination timing is endorsed. 
In study ZOSTER-041, subjects needed to have received an ABO compatible allogeneic renal transplant 4 
to 18 months prior to first vaccination, were receiving chronic IS therapy for the prevention of allograft 
rejection ≥1 month prior to first vaccination, were without an episode of allograft rejection ≤3 months 
prior to first vaccination, and had stable renal function and multiple dialysis options. 
In study ZOSTER-015, subjects had to be HIV-1 infected with diagnosis ≥1 year prior to enrolment. Three 
sub-groups of subjects were to be enrolled in this study, (i) ART-treated subjects with a CD4 T cell count 
of ≥200 cells/mm3, (ii) ART-treated subjects with a CD4 T cell count of 50-199 cells/mm3, and (iii) ART-
naïve HIV-infected subjects with a CD4 T cell count of ≥500 cells/mm3. However, as indicated in the 
SmPC, the majority (76.42%) of the subjects were stable on antiretroviral therapy (for at least one year) 
with a CD4 T-cell count ≥200 /mm3. The immunogenicity findings are therefore applicable for these 
subjects only. ‘Use of Shingrix in immunocompromised adults’ as missing information was removed from 
the updated RMP. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020

In all studies, subjects were excluded when vaccinated against HZ or varicella <1 year prior to first 
vaccination, planned to be vaccinated during the study with an HZ or varicella vaccine other than the 
study vaccine, if an HZ or varicella episode occurred <1 year prior to first vaccination, and if at risk of 
possible adverse reactions to the vaccine. 
Except study ZOSTER-001, which was a small-scale early phase study, all other 5 studies were 
randomised observer-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center studies, conducted in multiple countries. All 
the studies used the final selected HZ/su formulation, i.e. 50 µg gE adjuvanted with AS01B. In all 4 
pivotal studies, HZ/su was administered according to a 2-dose flexible schedule, with the second vaccine 
dose being administered 1 to 2 months after the first dose. This is different from the vaccination schedule 
used in previous studies supporting the initial MA, in which HZ/su was administered according to a fixed 
0, 2-month schedule. The choice for a flexible schedule with an interval of 1-2 month between doses for 
IC individuals was driven by the results of study ZOSTER-001; anti-gE GMCs were comparable at one-
month post-dose 2 when the two doses of HZ/su were administered at one or two months’ time interval. 
These results were not confirmed by a larger study although ZOSTER-001 was a small size study. 
Stratified analyses according to the time interval between doses were not done in studies included in the 
present submission. However, not performing such analyses could be acceptable since there is no CoP 
and since an efficacy trial was conducted in IC population (study ZOSTER-002) and demonstrated VE 
using this flexible schedule. This flexible schedule allows for an easier integration of the vaccination into 
the medical interventions of IC patients. In addition, in the SmPC, the primary vaccination schedule 
remains unchanged, and the additional schedule is presented appropriately: ‘For subjects who are 
immunodeficient or immunosuppressed due to disease or therapy, and whom would benefit from a 
shorter vaccination schedule, the second dose can be given 1 to 2 months after the initial dose (see 
section 5.1).’ 
The randomization algorithm used a minimization procedure accounting for age, gender, center, and 
relevant factors that were specific to each study, such as type of underlying disease, type of therapy, 
timing of vaccination in relation to timing of therapy. Subjects in the 5 studies were followed up for at 
least 12 months post last vaccination. Study design and methods are endorsed. 
2. Immunogenicity 
3.1. Objectives and endpoints, analyses 
Confirmatory immunogenicity endpoints in the pivotal immunogenicity studies ZOSTER-028, ZOSTER-039 
and ZOSTER-041 included both humoral (anti-gE Ab) and CMI (gE-specific CD4+ T-cells expressing ≥2 
activation markers involved in immunity such as interferon gamma (IFN-γ), interleukin 2 (IL-2), tumor 
necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), and cluster of differentiation marker 40 ligand (CD40L)) endpoints. The 
choice of both endpoints was endorsed by the CHMP, in spite of several limitations.  
In ZOSTER-002, humoral immune responses to gE and cell-mediated immunity (CMI) responses were 
evaluated at different time points, as descriptive endpoints. Such analyses were also part of the 
endpoints of the studies supporting the initial MA. 
Antibodies were shown to be involved in controlling both primary VZV infection and reactivation. 
Functional activities include antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and neutralization of 
cell-free virus (review in Laing 2018). Ab from varicella or HZ patients preferentially bind to gB and gE 
regions of VZV proteins, supporting the choice of the MAH to measure anti-gE specific Ab. However, the 
anti-gE ELISA assay does not measure the quality and functionality of the response. There is no 
characterization of the Ab in terms of sub-classes, affinity/avidity, and functionality which might be 
different in IC when compared to immunocompetent subjects. It is acknowledged that a good correlation 
of anti-VZV neutralizing Ab titers and anti-gE Ab titers was shown in samples from immunocompetent 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 64/173 
 
 
  
  
 
 
subjects included in study ZOSTER-010 (submitted at the initial MAA). T and B cells of IC patients might 
however respond differently to the antigen according to their disease and/or 
immunosuppressive/immunomodulatory therapy, which would have an impact on the Ab generation 
(quality and magnitude). 
The CMI endpoint is only a picture of the whole T cell immune response that may be induced by the 
vaccine. In addition to the induction of specific-Ab, innate immunity is activated and both CD4 and CD8 T 
cells are induced after VZV infection. Studies of systemic memory T cell responses in latently infected 
individuals reveal antigen-specific Th1 cells (expressing IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF-α), cytotoxic T lymphocytes 
within both CD4 and CD8 subsets (review in Laing 2018). CD4 T cell reactivity to gE was observed in 
healthy virus carriers. It was also shown that VZV gE (an gB) is a major target of CD4 and CD8 T cells 
reconstituting during zoster after allogenic transplant (Kleemann, 2012), supporting the choice of the 
MAH to study the induction of gE-specific CD4 T cell after vaccination. These findings also suggest the 
potential clinical efficacy with the use of VZV glycoprotein subunit vaccines.  Evidence of specific CD4[2+] 
T cells induction indicates a vaccine response after encountering VZV-antigens but the clinical relevance is 
not known. Comparison with the immune responses induced by the natural infection and additional 
characterization of the vaccine-induced responses, such as the characterization of the Th profile (Th17, 
Th2, Tfh, etc) or the memory profile (effector vs central memory), as well as the characterisation of 
antigens-specific CD8 T cells, might give a clearer descriptive view of immune responses overall and of 
the impact of the different diseases on VZV/gE responses. But it is acknowledged that the clinical 
relevance is not known.  
Again, T (and B cells) of IC patients may respond differently to the vaccination (pre-existing memory cells 
but also naïve cells that would be primed by the vaccination) depending of the disease and/or the therapy 
of the patient. The quantity of circulating primed-cells and antigen-presenting cells might also be lower in 
immunocompromised subjects. Thus, the quantity and the quality of the response may be affected. 
Immunogenicity endpoints were descriptive endpoints in study ZOSTER-002 and confirmatory 
immunogenicity endpoints in the pivotal immunogenicity studies ZOSTER-028, ZOSTER-039 and ZOSTER-
041. In these last 3 studies a hierarchical procedure was applied to control for Type I error. The 
objectives were assessed sequentially in order of ascending rank until an objective was not met. At this 
point, the evaluation proceeded with descriptive analyses of the remaining objectives.  
Success criteria, based on VRR and GM ratio, were defined to evaluate the magnitude of the humoral and 
cellular immune responses induced by the vaccine. These criteria were arbitrarily defined and relatively 
stringent (except for the CMI GM ratio for study ZOSTER-028). These criteria were considered acceptable 
by CHMP. 
Humoral immunogenicity results were expressed in term of GMC, fold increase over pre-vaccination, 
seropositivity rate and vaccine response rate as for the pivotal studies supporting the MA which is 
appropriate. Whereas all different results expressions are informative, the GMC is considered as the best.  
Cellular immunogenicity results were expressed in terms of frequency of CD4[2+] T cells, fold increase 
over pre-vaccination of gE-specific CD4[2+] T cells and VRR. In this case, the cut-off was considered to 
be 320 per 106 CD4 T cells. The rationale of the choice of this cut-off is not clear. The issue is however 
not pursued since this cut-off was used in all pivotal studies and was already applied in studies supporting 
the initial MA. The choice to express the CMI data in term of (at least) double-positive cell frequencies 
allow for better specificity compared to single-positive cells frequencies. However, the fact that the results 
were not expressed in number of circulating cells/ml of blood is a limitation for results interpretation. The 
number of circulating CD4 may be lower in IC than in immunocompetent subjects and may vary 
according to several factors, including underlying diseases and IS treatment (type and duration). CD4

number could also vary according to the time after transplant in HCT patients with an immune system 
under reconstitution. 
For all pivotal studies, the primary immunogenicity analysis was based on the according to protocol (ATP) 
cohort for humoral immunogenicity or CMI, as appropriate and the primary persistence analysis was 
based on the ATP cohort for humoral or CMI persistence, as appropriate. 
Analysis adjusting for relevant factors such as treatment, underlying disease or age were further 
performed.  
3.2. Assays 
Two assays were used in the pivotal trials, an ELISA to measure the concentration of Ab specific to gE 
and a flow cytometry assays to detect gE-specific CD4 T cells. Methods were overall endorsed. Validation 
and SOPs that were not yet submitted at the Initial MAA were submitted (except one) in the current 
application. A summary of the main changes was also provided. 
Concentration of circulating Ab specific to gE was measured by ELISA by using the same protocol as for 
the pivotal studies supporting the initial MA.  
Measurements of CMI responses were performed on thawed peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 
by intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). The gE ICS assay measures the frequency of gE-specific CD4+ T 
cells expressing the activation marker CD40L and three Th1 cytokines in vitro. Specific-CD8 T cells were 
not evidence by the current method. The validation of the assay was updated to ensure adequate 
measurement of low frequencies of gE-specific CD4 T cells. The protocol was also updated by integrating 
different changes that would improve the detection of specific T cell but also slightly affect the results. 
How the potential data analyses biases were minimized was not presented. However, because of the 
experience of the MAH and because results will not be strictly compared between studies, this is deemed 
acceptable. As mentioned above, an additional reason to not compare results between studies is that 
results were expressed in term of frequency and not in number of circulating cells/ml of blood.  
The MAH provided further documentation to probe method validation for the Anti-gE ELISA analysis.  
Regarding gE ICS analysis, precision and linearity were further evaluated before using the assay on the 
pivotal study samples.  
The PBMC viability evaluation upon thawing and after the ICS (at the time of PBMCs acquisition) was 
endorsed as well as the addition of an anti-human CD3 Ab for the PBMCs staining. Both staining (dead 
and CD3 cells) are a real added value to ensure the detection of the appropriate target cells.  
3.3 Results 
Vaccination 
Based on the ZOSTER-001 study results, vaccine recipients were administered with the first dose 50-70 
days post-transplant (see assessment ZOSTER-001, in section supportive studies). Although this is 
currently unusual to vaccinate as earlier after transplantation, this might be relevant since HCT recipients 
are at high risk of HZ.  
The flexible 2-dose schedule is discussed in section clinical aspects, introduction. Although serology 
results might have been presented according to time interval between dose 1 and dose 2 to confirm 
results from study ZOSTER-001, such analysis are not deemed necessary in view of the efficacy results 
and the absence of CoP. 
Demographic characteristics 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 66/173 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
Characteristics of the ATP cohort for humoral immunogenicity and the ATP cohort for CMI immunogenicity 
were generally comparable and representative of those of TVC. Age, gender and geographic ancestry 
were in general well balanced between groups. More subjects of the age stratum above 50 years of age 
were enrolled compared to the age stratum 18-49 years of age. Median age at first vaccination was in the 
same range for all studies (46.5-57.0 YOA). Most subjects were males, except for study ZOSTER-028. 
Most of the subjects were Caucasian. Some characteristics (gender and geographic ancestry) were 
imbalanced between groups in the ATP cohort for CMI immunogenicity (studies ZOSTER-028 and 
ZOSTER-041). This could be attributed to the fact that ATP cohort for CMI immunogenicity was a sub-
group of the subjects selected in countries that had access to a PBMCs processing facility. The impact on 
the results is unknown. 
Other characteristics were not always similar between ATP cohorts for humoral or CMI immunogenicity 
(such as proportion of haematological malignancies in ZOSTER-039 or of tumour in ZOSTER-028) or not 
always balanced between groups for the ATP cohort for CMI immunogenicity (such as proportion of 
tumour in ZOSTER-028). Many factors could influence the observed immunogenicity in addition to the 
gender and the underlying malignancy, such as the time interval between vaccination doses or between 
blood samples after-vaccination, the moment of the vaccination regarding the duration under IS or the 
number of chemotherapy cycles, etc. Because of these many variables, the impact of these differences in 
characteristics between ATP cohorts or between groups within an ATP cohort on the results is not known. 
Baseline characteristics 
Most of the subjects, both HZ/su vaccinated and placebo, were anti-gE seropositive at baseline (≥97 
mIU/ml). This suggest that most of the subjects experienced a previous natural infection with VZV or a 
vaccination >1 year before HZ/su vaccination and that no (or very few) data for seronegative subjects 
were therefore generated. Results were not stratified according to the VZV infection or vaccination status. 
VZV-naive subjects are not at risk of HZ occurrence, questioning the impact of the HZ/su vaccination of 
VZV-naïve subjects in term of both safety and immunogenicity (see safety discussion). The MAH 
explained previously that NC data suggest that HZ/su is not expected to induce appropriate primary 
immune responses needed to protect VZV-naïve children against varicella and by extension to protect 
VZV-naïve individuals against varicella. Accordingly, the SmPC reflects that HZ/su is not indicated for 
prevention of primary varicella infection.  
Very small numbers of subjects previously vaccinated against varicella were included in studies ZOSTER-
028 (n=1), ZOSTER-039 (n=2) and ZOSTER-041 (n=3). History of previous vaccination was not collected 
in studies ZOSTER-001, ZOSTER-002 and ZOSTER-015. No specific analyses were therefore performed in 
this subset of subjects, and, consequently, it is not known if the vaccine response will be of the same 
magnitude and quality in subjects that did not experienced chickenpox because of vaccination against 
varicella in the infancy. At the moment, most of the subjects > 18YOA experienced varicella but this 
would change, at least in certain countries, in the coming years. In addition, these subjects are in general 
considered not at risk of reactivation. Literature indicates that HZ cases are nevertheless reported (Tseng 
2011, Baxter 2013, Weinmann 2013, Civen 2016), although at a much lower incidence than in non-
vaccinated children and adolescents. This incidence might increase with age and with IC conditions that 
subjects might experience. Based on study ZOSTER-048 results, no safety concern is expected in subjects 
previously vaccinated against varicella in the infancy. It is considered that the history of varicella 
vaccination will be taken into account in the official recommendations, and/or in the benefit/risk 
assessment made by the practitioner. The MAH is monitoring the epidemiology of VZV in Europe (Part II 
in the RMP). The MAH is also asked to discuss through the PSUR new data (vigilance, literature) on the 
medical need, immunogenicity/safety/efficacy of Shingrix in this particular subgroups of patients. See 
also efficacy and safety discussion.

Proportion of seropositive subjects with gE specific-CD4 T cells at baseline was not presented. Because 
the number of subjects for CMI analysis is limited, it is not expected that interpretable results would be 
available. 
HZ/su-induced immunity 
Overall, the vaccination with HZ/su induced a strong anti-gE Ab and a gE-specific T cell response in the IC 
recipients from all 4 pivotal studies and study ZOSTER-15 (based on confirmatory and descriptive 
analyses). VRRs and GMCs ratio results were consistent with the GMC results. 
The confirmatory objectives of studies ZOSTER-028, ZOSTER-039 and ZOSTER-41 were met, except the 
secondary confirmatory objective in terms of VRR for gE-specific CD4 T cell frequencies at Month 2 that 
was not met.  
Across IC population of studies ZOSTER-002, ZOSTER-039 and ZOSTER-041, post-vaccination anti-gE 
GMC peaked after 2 doses, then decreased but remained higher than the baseline level up to 1 or 2 years 
post dose 2 (depending of the studies). Range of values were comparable for ZOSTER-002 and ZOSTER-
039 studies. Results of study ZOSTER-041 were higher than those observed in both other studies (and 
comparable to those of study ZOSTER-028 observed post-dose 2). In study  ZOSTER-028, the anti-gE 
GMC peaked post-dose 1 and decreased thereafter. The absence of Ab titers enhancement by the second 
vaccine dose is surprising. This might be because the second dose was given at the first day of a 
subsequent chemotherapy cycle, blunting the immune response induced by the vaccine. Ab GMC 
remained higher than the baseline level 1 year post-vaccination. Range of values tended to be higher 
than those observed in study ZOSTER-002. The anti-gE Ab response, detected in all 4 pivotal studies, 
were however lower than those observed in the pivotal trial ZOSTER-006 conducted in immunocompetent 
adults (See SmPC, ZOSTER-006 study, median of anti-gE Ab level post-dose 2 was 53,375 mIU/ml with a 
median at baseline of 1283 mIU/ml). 
Robust Ab response were already observed post-dose 2 in study ZOSTER-015. The response were in the 
same range than those observed in study ZOSTER-006. These subjects received a third of vaccine 6 
month post first vaccination. Hence, the 1-year data cannot be compared with those of the pivotal 
studies. 
Data were further analysed by age (all pivotal studies), underlying diseases (studies ZOSTER-002, 
ZOSTER-028, and ZOSTER-039), timing of vaccination in relation to the particular chemotherapy/IS 
cancer therapy cycle (studies ZOSTER-028 and ZOSTER-039), IS treatment (study ZOSTER-041) strata. 
No consistent trend was observed when comparing the vaccine-induced Ab results for the two age strata; 
Humoral responses were comparable between 18-49YOA and ≥50YOA groups in studies ZOSTER-002 and 
ZOSTER-028, whereas higher anti-gE GMC were observed in the younger group in studies ZOSTER-039 
and ZOSTER-041.  
In ZOSTER-002 and ZOSTER-039 studies, anti-gE Ab responses were higher for patients with multiple 
myeloma (MM) when compared to subjects with other underlying diseases, particularly NHBCL and CLL. 
This was already shown in study ZOSTER-001 (Stadtmauer, 2014) and anticipated for CLL patients. This 
lower vaccine-induced immune responses might be explained by the fact that NHBCL patients generally 
have undergone various chemotherapy treatments that could be highly lymphotoxic before the collection 
of PBMCs for the autologous stem cells transplantation. Conversely, the HCT is generally the first line 
treatment for MM, i.e. with no/few IS treatment before the PBMC collection or HZ/su vaccination. In study 
ZOTER-039, rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen that deplete B cells were administered to the 
majority of the NHBCL and CLL patients within interval between 6 months prior to vaccination and 1 
month post-dose 2. Immunosuppressive/immunomodulating therapy post-HCT is current practice after 
allo-transplant but also for other subgroups of patient. In addition, new therapies are currently used or 
may be developed, for which the impact on protective response might be important. Therapies such as 
Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors and other treatments such as IL-2 inhibitors, IL-12/IL-23 inhibitor, 
leflunomide/teriflunomide, IL-17 inhibitor, abatacept and anti-integrin inhibitor have not been used in the 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

subjects who participated in pivotal IC studies.The consequences on the short and long-term protection is 
not known. This concern is addressed in the SmPC by stating that the studies were not designed to 
assess the impact of specific immunosuppressive treatments on vaccine efficacy. Not all types of 
immunosuppressive therapies were used in the populations studied. 
In study ZOSTER-002, only 22.5% and 22.1% of the subjects received at least one IS treatment from 
HSCT up to 30 days after Dose 2 (mTVC). In study ZOSTER-039, higher anti-gE Ab responses from 1 
month up to 1 year after the second vaccination dose were observed when the vaccine was administered 
after the cancer therapy when compared to an administration during the cancer therapy. In study 
ZOSTER-028, higher Ab GMCs were observed post-vaccination in the group of subjects vaccinated before 
the cancer therapy (PreChemo) when compared to the group of subjects vaccinated during the course of 
the therapy (OnChemo). Results of study ZOSTER-041 (slight differences in Ab GMCs according to the IS 
therapy) are in line with those of all three other pivotal studies, i.e. interference of IS therapy on the 
vaccine immunogenicity up to 1 year. 
All these observations indicate that underlying diseases and/or associated 
IS/immunomodulatory/cytotoxic treatment(s), before, during and after the vaccination period interfere in 
a more or less important manner on the vaccine-induced immune responses in the short and the long 
term.  
Analysis by relevant factors such as IS treatment, cycles or time after cancer therapy were not always 
performed in the different studies although all these factors might influence the vaccine-induced immune 
responses. The timing of vaccination post-transplantation and the duration under IS therapy might also 
modulate the short- and long-term immune responses. This is applicable for both humoral and CMI 
responses. However, because of the many factors that might influence the responses, the limited number 
of subjects included in the studies (and by strata), the limitation of the immunogenicity read-out, and the 
absence of CoP, such additional immunogenicity analyses might not be as informative. Data from 
ZOSTER-028 and ZOSTER-039 indicating that lower humoral immune responses were observed when 
Shingrix was administered during versus before or after IS cancer therapy is presented in the SmPC. A 
statement to draw the attention of the HCP on the fact that most patients were not under IS therapy is 
also included.  
In the absence of CoP, it is not possible to translate anti-gE Ab titers in clinical protection and therefore to 
predict higher or lower vaccine efficacy in special populations based on vaccine-induced humoral 
response. In study ZOSTER-002, it appears, that although low humoral immune responses were 
observed, VE for NHBCL patients was roughly similar to the overall VE, which is somewhat reassuring but 
should not be taken as a demonstration of efficacy in NHBCL patients as 95% CI are very wide.  
It may therefore be impossible to associate humoral immune responses or a threshold with protection; 
Circulating Ab titers might not be a good marker to evaluate the protective response for all 
immunosuppressive conditions or the Ab concentration needed for protection might be low. It is therefore 
not possible to predict protection in subgroups of the population for whom efficacy data are not available. 
In study ZOSTER-028, even if results should be interpreted with caution because of the variable timing of 
vaccinations and blood sampling, Ab GMCs were similar at 1 year post-vaccination for both PreChemo and 
OnChemo groups although higher Ab GMCs were observed early post-vaccination in the PreChemo group 
when compared to the OnChemo group. So, even if Ab responses are higher in the short-term post-
vaccination, this does not guarantee a persistence of the immune responses of higher magnitude. The 
vaccine-induced response might be different depending on the time of vaccine administration respective 
to IS therapy, but still not optimal to induce an adequate immune memory. The underlying disease 
and/or the IS/immunomodulating/cytotoxic treatments might have impaired the induction of memory B 
cells and long-lived plasma cells that participate in the Ab production in the long term. The induction of 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 69/173 
 
 
  
  
 
VZV-specific CD4 T cells, particularly T follicular helper cells, that are most probably involved in Ab 
persistence, might also be impaired. Persistence of specific Ab induced by the vaccination might therefore 
be different between IC and immunocompetent individuals. The clinical relevance of these observations is 
however not known. Results of long-term persistence data are described in the SmPC tables.  
Taken together, whether and when a boost will be needed to ensure long term protection in (special 
populations of) IC population is not known. Several boosts might be needed. The need for a boost is also 
questioned for subjects that were vaccinated post-HCT several years ago and reaching 50 YOA. The 
question can also be extended to immunocompetent subjects since the duration of long-term protection is 
not known. The MAH acknowledges this concern since ‘Long-term efficacy and assessment of the need for 
additional doses in adults 18 years of age and older’ and ‘Long-term immunogenicity in adults 18 years of 
age and older’ are included as missing information in the RMP. Whereas a long term follow-up of VE on 
immunocompetent subjects is planned, the MAH does not plan to assess long-term vaccine efficacy of 
Shingrix in IC subjects as no conclusion on the long-term efficacy would be possible due to variability of 
the immune status that evolves over time depending on the clinical outcome (see efficacy discussion). 
A follow-up of a sub-group included in the study ZOSTER-041 is planned to assess long-term 
immunogenicity as well as the safety and immunogenicity of 2 additional doses of Shingrix in IC subjects 
(study ZOSTER-073). Although this population were vaccinated during IS therapy, subjects mounted a 
higher anti-gE Ab responses than patients with haematological malignancies included in ZOSTER-002 and 
ZOSTER-039 studies. There is therefore a limitation for extrapolating the data that will be obtained in 
study ZOSTER-073 to different IC populations but, on the other hand, the immunogenicity results of 
study ZOSTER-073 might be informative for the IC populations where the patients are on similar chronic 
IS therapies. Safety and immunogenicity data of booster dose(s) were gathered in studies ZOSTER-049 
and ZOSTER-060 conducted in older adults. Taken together, the safety data of the 3 studies in 
conjunction with the immunogenicity data that will be obtained in study ZOSTER-073 would support the 
decision of administering a booster dose in IC patients.   
HZ/su-induced specific-CD4 T cells  
CMI data were more limited than the Ab data. As mentioned earlier, the interpretation of these data is 
limited. 
Confirmatory analyses and descriptive analysis demonstrate the capacity of two doses of vaccine to elicit 
a specific CD4 T cell response. The frequency of gE-specific CD4[2+] T cells was still present 1 year 
following vaccination, even if at a lower level. The clinical relevance of these findings are unknown. 
There were no consistent trend in the results across studies when analyses by strata (age and underlying 
diseases). Overall, CMI results were not associated with anti-gE Ab concentrations. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
HZ/su was shown to be immunogenic in all 5 populations of immunocompromised subjects that were 
evaluated. Anti-gE Ab response was high after 2 dose of HZ/su and Ab were still present, although at a 
lower level, up to 1 year. gE-specific CD4 T cells were detected after 2 doses of HZ/su.  
Differences in the magnitude of the immune responses were observed depending on IC condition.  
There are only limited data on the impact of specific therapies on the immune responses, but there is an 
indirect evidence that patients under anti-CD20 antibodies present much lower humoral responses. This 
indirect evidence is provided by the analyses by underlying disease showing that NHBCL and CLL patients 
present much lower humoral responses. Lower humoral immune responses were observed when Shingrix 
was administered during versus before or after IS cancer therapy. These data suggest that immune 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

responses might be affected by different factors such as the underlying disease and type of IS therapy, 
but also by the timing to vaccination (before, during, after), and/or interval between vaccination and the 
IS therapy. Short and long-term vaccine-induced immune responses might therefore be differently 
affected and be variable among the large and heterogeneous population of IC patients.   
In the absence of a CoP, the clinical relevance of the immunogenicity results is not known. The findings 
regarding the variable immunogenicity with respect to the timing of vaccination would still need to be 
better reflected in the SmPC. The need for boost(s) (if and when) still needs to be determined. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main studies 
Vaccine efficacy in the prevention of HZ was assessed in ZOSTER-002 and as a post-hoc analysis in 
ZOSTER-039. 
ZOSTER-002 
A phase III, randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, clinical trial to assess the 
prophylactic efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals’ herpes zoster gE/AS01B candidate 
vaccine when administered intramuscularly on a two-dose schedule to adult autologous haematopoietic 
stem cell transplant (HCT) recipients 
ZOSTER-039 
A Phase III, randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre study to assess the safety and 
immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals’ Herpes Zoster HZ/su candidate vaccine when administered 
intramuscularly on a two-dose schedule to adults aged 18 years and older with haematologic 
malignancies. 
Methods 
ZOSTER-002 and ZOSTER-039 were phase III, randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multicentre, multi-country (28 and 21 countries respectively) clinical trials to assess Shingrix when 
administered intramuscularly on a two-dose schedule respectively to adults recipients of autologous 
haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) and to adults with hematologic malignancies. The second dose 
of study vaccine/placebo was administered 1-2 months after the first dose. Subjects were to be followed 
at least until approximately a year after the second dose. 
ZOSTER-002 was primarily conducted to evaluate the efficacy of Shingrix in the prevention of HZ, while in 
ZOSTER-039, efficacy analyses were performed post-hoc. 
In ZOSTER-002, the cut-off date for the final triggered analysis occurred when at least the pre-specified 
number of confirmed HZ cases in the primary cohort for efficacy required for final analyses were accrued 
and all subjects have completed the Month 13 Visit. At the time of the final analysis the study was 
unblinded. Once follow-up was completed for ongoing suspected HZ case for at least 90 days, the study 
ended.

Design of studies  
ZOSTER-002 and ZOSTER-039 were Phase III, randomised, placebo-controlled, observer-blinded, multi-
country study (respectively 28 and 21 countries) trials with two parallel groups. 
Duration of the study: 
For both studies, each subject was to be followed at least until approximately 12 months after the second 
dose of study vaccine/placebo.  
Final analysis and end of study: 
ZOSTER-002: 
The cut-off date for the final triggered analysis was planned when at least the pre-specified number of 
confirmed HZ cases in the primary cohort for efficacy required for final analyses have been accrued and 
all subjects have completed Visit 4 (Month 13). Study end was planned to take place when: (i) the 
conditions for final triggered analysis are met, and, (ii) follow-up was completed for each suspected HZ 
case that occurred up to the time that the study site was informed that the cut-off date for final analysis 
was established. Each suspected HZ case occurring up to the time that the study site was informed that 
the cut-off date for final triggered analysis was established, was followed for at least 90 days (unless the 
case is one without the characteristic HZ or VZV rash). At the time of the final analysis the study was 
unblinded. 
ZOSTER-039: 
Study end took place when all subjects had completed their Month 13/Visit 4 follow-up visit.

within 8 days prior to or within 14 days after either dose of study vaccine. 
Pregnant or lactating female. 
Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive precautions before 
Month 3 (i.e., 2 months after the last dose of study vaccine/placebo). 
The timing of study vaccine administration was dependent upon the number of days in between 
immunosuppressive cancer treatments: 
- 
If each cancer therapy treatment was separated by more than 20 days, the first vaccination had to be 
planned as late as possible during this time period while still allowing 10 days before the next 
foreseen treatment. For example, in a schedule with 30 days between treatments, study vaccination 
should ideally be given around days 17-20 after the previous treatment. 
- 
If the cancer treatment cycle did not allow spacing the vaccination between each cancer treatment by 
at least 10 days, the first vaccination had to be scheduled from 10 days to 6 months after the full 
cancer therapy course. 
- 
The second dose of study vaccine was to be given 1 to 2 months after the first dose. Study 
vaccination had again to be planned as late as possible during the time period in between cancer 
treatments while still allowing 10 days before the next foreseen cancer treatment. 
Definition of cancer therapy and cancer therapy cycles: 
1. Direct anti-cancer treatments (chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy; if radiotherapy it must be in 
combination with either chemotherapy or immunotherapy) that are immunosuppressive. Examples (not 
an exhaustive list): Chemotherapy: CHOP (cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin, Oncovin, 
prednisone), ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide), VAMP (e.g., vincristine, amethopterin, 6-
mercaptopurine, prednisone) Immunotherapy: rituximab, lenalidomide 
2. Immunosuppressive therapies administered as part of the anti-cancer treatment or to avoid/treat 
complications of the anti-cancer treatment. Examples (not an exhaustive list): Cyclosporine, tacrolimus, 
used mainly in case of allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation; Steroids at high 
immunosuppressive doses equivalent to ≥20mg/day prednisone for more than 14 consecutive days. 
Both (1) and (2) are the immunosuppressive cancer therapies which should be taken into account with 
respect to the timing of study vaccine administration. 
Cancer therapy course: As used in the protocol, an entire series of cancer therapy cycles (repeated 
treatments) often lasting several months. 
Cancer therapy cycle: Individual cancer therapy treatments typically scheduled every 1, 2, 3 or 4 weeks 
within the cancer therapy course.

Treatments 
The vaccine (HZ/su or Placebo) was administered IM according to a flexible schedule, with the second 
vaccine dose being administered 1 to 2 months after the first dose. The standard route was IM injection 
in the deltoid of the non-dominant arm. 
All the studies used the final selected HZ/su formulation, i.e. 50 µg gE adjuvanted with AS01B. 
Throughout this report, the GSK HZ vaccine is referred to as either Shingrix or HZ/su. Note that in 
ZOSTER-015, the vaccine has been referred to as gE/AS01B. 
In ZOSTER-015, 3 vaccine doses were administered IM according to a 0, 2, 6-months schedule. 
In all studies, the control group received placebo injections (lyophilized sucrose reconstituted with saline 
[NaCl] solution). 
Study duration: 
All subjects in the studies (except ZOSTER-001) were followed up for at least 12 months post last 
vaccination. In ZOSTER-002, the median follow-up for safety and efficacy was approximately 29 months 
and 21 months, respectively. In ZOSTER-028, ZOSTER-039 and ZOSTER-041, the study duration for each 
subject was 13 to 15 months. In ZOSTER-015, the study duration was approximately 18 months. 
The vaccine (HZ/su or Placebo) was administered according to a flexible schedule, with the second 
vaccine dose being administered 1 to 2 months after the first dose. The standard route was IM injection 
in the deltoid of the non-dominant arm.

Methods Used to Evaluate Efficacy 
The below sections list the key elements of the efficacy assessments as performed for ZOSTER-002 and 
ZOSTER-039 (if applicable).  
Suspected HZ case definition: 
A suspected case of HZ was defined as: (1) a new rash characteristic of HZ (e.g., unilateral, dermatomal 
and accompanied by pain broadly defined to include allodynia, pruritus or other sensations), or a 
vesicular rash suggestive of VZV infection regardless of the distribution, and no alternative diagnosis; or 
(2) a clinical presentation (symptoms and/or signs) and specific laboratory findings* suggestive of VZV 
infection in the absence of characteristic HZ or VZV rash. 
*Specific laboratory findings included VZV-positive PCR, culture, immuno-histochemical staining, or other 
test, performed in the course of a medical evaluation that strongly suggested VZV infection. 
Evaluation of cases of suspected HZ with characteristic HZ or rash suggestive of VZV 
reactivation: 
Subjects who experienced any symptom/sign suggestive of HZ or VZV reactivation were asked to visit the 
study site (preferably within 96 hours after the rash or pain began) for further evaluation. At Visit HZ-1 
on Day HZ-0, the investigator performed a clinical examination. All clinically diagnosed suspected cases of 
HZ or VZV reactivation were documented by digital photography and rash lesion samples were collected 
to confirm the event by PCR. 
In ZOSTER-002, subjects were additionally asked by the study staff/investigator to complete a Zoster 
Brief Pain Inventory (ZBPI) questionnaire to collect information on the severity and duration of the HZ-
associated pain. The impact of the HZ episode on the subject’s QoL was measured using the ZBPI, as well 
as the Euro-QoL 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) and Short form-36 (SF-36) questionnaires. After Visit HZ-1, 5 
contacts and 1 additional HZ visit (Visit HZ-7 on Day HZ-91) were planned for follow-up of the HZ 
episode. Subjects with pain were followed until a 4-week pain-free period occurred or until at least Day 
HZ-91. For all subjects with ongoing HZ-associated pain at the cut-off date for final triggered analysis, 
follow-up continued until at least Visit HZ-7 (Day HZ-91). As soon as the HZ-associated pain ceased 
(defined as a 4-week pain-free period) and the HZ rash resolved, subsequent HZ follow-up visits or 
contacts were suspended, except for Visit HZ-7 if Day HZ-91 was foreseen to occur later than the cut-off 
date for final triggered analysis in order to capture all PHN cases if pain resumed after the 4-week pain-
free period. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 78/173 
 
 
  
  
Evaluation of cases of suspected HZ without characteristic HZ or VZV rash: 
In case of suspected HZ diagnosed according to criterion (2), i.e. without characteristic HZ or VZV rash, 
the HZ onset date was the date on which the signs/symptoms related to the clinical diagnosis of 
suspected HZ were first noted. The end date of the HZ episode was defined as the date on which the 
investigator or an attending physician considered the case as resolved. 
Follow-up visits, contacts and study procedures, such as collection of rash lesion samples and taking of 
photographs of HZ rash, were not applicable. These cases were considered as serious adverse events 
(SAEs)/AEs and recorded as such, with the specification that the event was related to HZ. 
In ZOSTER-002, these suspected HZ cases were evaluated if they occurred during the study period up to 
the cut-off date for final triggered analysis. 
Confirmation of suspected HZ cases: 
By PCR 
Whenever possible, rash lesion samples were collected from subjects clinically diagnosed as having a 
suspected case of HZ based on criterion (1). A PCR algorithm was used to classify each suspected case of 
HZ as a confirmed HZ case or not. Three rash lesion samples were tested by PCR. 
Cases of suspected HZ were not considered a confirmed case of HZ for the efficacy analysis if they 
potentially could constitute a primary VZV infection (varicella). For subjects born in 1980 or later, or 
before 1980 in a tropical region, and with no serological evidence of prior VZV infection available at the 
time of Visit 1 (baseline), a case of suspected HZ with a disseminated onset or a VZV infection without 
characteristic rash [criterion (2)] could represent a primary VZV infection. For those subjects, the 
following approach was taken: (i) With a VZV-positive PCR result, with a VZV inconclusive PCR result, or 
with no rash lesion samples available for PCR testing, the case was not considered a confirmed case of HZ 
if the subject was diagnosed with suspected HZ according to criterion (1) and presented with a 
disseminated rash from onset, and the subject was VZV seronegative at baseline (prevaccination at Visit 
1) based on testing of pre-vaccination serum; (ii) Cases diagnosed in the absence of rash as suspected 
HZ according to criterion (2), and who were VZV seronegative at baseline (pre-vaccination at Visit 1) 
based on testing of pre-vaccination serum, were not considered a confirmed HZ case. 
By the HZAC 
The HZAC consisted of physicians with HZ expertise. HZAC members participating as investigator in the 
study did not evaluate cases from their own study site. HZAC members were blinded to treatment 
assignments. For every suspected case of HZ or VZV reactivation, each HZAC member was asked to 
make a clinical determination of whether the case was HZ based on review of the available clinical 
information and laboratory information from the study site. The HZAC classified cases as either ‘HZ’, ‘not 
HZ’ or ‘not able to decide’. 
However, the HZAC classification served as the final case confirmation only when the case could not be 
confirmed or excluded by PCR e.g., when all samples from a given subject were inadequate, or when no 
samples were available for a given subject, including when suspected HZ was based on criterion (2) 
without characteristic HZ or VZV rash. Therefore, when available, definitive PCR results determined the 
final HZ case assignment. 
HZAC classification, as described above, would not have served as the final case determination for 
suspected cases of HZ who could potentially constitute a primary VZV infection (varicella). For these 
cases, baseline VZV serology was taken into account to determine whether the case was considered a 
confirmed case of HZ. 
Evaluation of cases of suspected HZ without typical rash of HZ or of VZV: 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 79/173 
 
 
  
  
In ZOSTER-002, cases of HZ without characteristic VZV or HZ rash were recorded as SAE and specified 
there as related to HZ. In ZOSTER-002, cases of HZ without characteristic VZV or HZ rash were recorded 
as SAEs/AEs, as appropriate, and specified there as related to HZ.  
Assessment of HZ-associated complications: 
In ZOSTER-002, PHN was defined by the presence of HZ-associated ‘worst’ pain persisting or appearing 
more than 90 days after onset of the HZ rash. ‘Worst’ pain was defined as HZ-associated pain rated as 3 
or greater on the ‘worst’ pain ZBPI question. 
In ZOSTER-039, PHN was defined as clinically significant pain or painful abnormal sensations (e.g., 
allodynia or itch) that persisted 3 months or more after HZ rash onset. However, no ZBPI questionnaires 
were completed. 
In both ZOSTER-002 and ZOSTER-039, any HZ complications, according to the definitions below, had to 
be recorded by the investigator. HZ complications were considered as AEs or SAEs. HZ complications 
associated with confirmed HZ are considered for analysis of the applicable secondary endpoint and 
include: 
HZ vasculitis: Vasculopathy or vasculitis (based on clinical, laboratory or radiologic findings) that is 
temporally associated with an episode of HZ and, in the opinion of the investigator, was caused directly 
by the VZV infection arising from the HZ episode. 
Disseminated disease: Defined as ≥ 6 HZ lesions clearly outside the primary dermatome as per the 
investigator’s judgment. 
Ophthalmic disease: Defined as HZ affecting any eye structure as per the investigator’s judgment. 
Neurologic disease: Defined as cranial or peripheral nerve palsies, myelitis, meningoencephalitis, stroke, 
etc. that is temporally associated with an episode of HZ and, in the opinion of the investigator, was 
caused directly by VZV infection arising from the HZ episode. 
Visceral disease: Defined as an abnormality of one or more internal organs (e.g., hepatitis, pneumonitis, 
gastroenteritis, etc.) that is temporally associated with an episode of HZ and, in the opinion of the 
investigator, was caused directly by VZV infection arising from the HZ episode. 
Evaluation of Severity and Duration of HZ-associated Pain and Quality of Life Assessment 
(ZOSTER-002): 
Evaluation of severity and duration of HZ-associated pain using the ZBPI questionnaire  
The ZBPI was used to quantify HZ pain and discomfort and measure selected Activities of Daily Living 
(ADL) and health. 
Subjects with suspected HZ with characteristic HZ or VZV rash [by criterion (1)] were asked to complete 
the ZBPI questionnaire on Day HZ-0 (Visit HZ-1), daily from Day HZ-1 up to Day HZ-28, and weekly from 
Day HZ-29 onwards until HZ-associated pain ceased (defined as a 4-week pain-free period). 
To assess the duration of HZ-associated pain, a 4-week pain-free period was used to confirm cessation of 
HZ-associated pain. If that pain-free period was not achieved or pain resumed after a 4-week pain-free 
period, and/or if pain did not cease, the time to event was censored at the last day of HZ-associated pain. 
For all subjects with ongoing HZ-associated pain at the cut-off date for final triggered analysis, ZBPI data 
were collected until a 4-week pain-free period was documented OR until at least Day HZ-91. 
Health-related Quality of Life assessment using the EQ-5D and SF-36 questionnaires 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 80/173 
 
 
  
  
Both the EQ-5D questionnaire and SF-36 health survey questionnaire were completed by all subjects at 
Day 0 (Visit 1) to generate a baseline measurement, and at 1 month and 1 year post Dose 2. Subjects 
with suspected HZ with characteristic HZ or VZV rash [by criterion (1)] were asked to complete both 
questionnaires on a weekly basis during the period for which ZBPI questionnaires were completed (until 
Day HZ-28 at minimum). 
Sample size 
In ZOSTER-002, target enrolment was foreseen to be approximately 2126 eligible HCT recipients (1063 in 
the gE/AS01B group and 1063 in the placebo group). Enrolment was planned to be terminated when the 
target number of subjects had been reached.  
In ZOSTER-039, target enrolment was approximately 552 eligible adults (276 per treatment group) 
diagnosed with haematologic malignancies. 
Randomisation 
In both studies, eligible subjects were randomised to the investigational vaccine gE/AS01B or placebo 
according to a 1:1 ratio (vaccine:placebo). The treatment allocation at the investigator site was 
performed using a central randomisation system on internet. 
Blinding (masking) 
The studies were conducted in an observer-blind manner because the HZ/su and Placebo vaccines 
differed in their preparation method and appearance. Therefore, HZ/su and Placebo were prepared and 
administered only by authorized medical personnel not involved in any of the clinical study evaluation 
assays. The blinding was maintained until study end. Of note for ZOSTER-015, the investigators and 
investigative staff could have become aware of treatment allocation (inadvertent unblinding) with respect 
to some data included in the Month 7 CSR. 
Statistical methods 
Study cohorts 
Total Enrolled Cohort consisted of all subjects enrolled, that is all subjects who signed the ICF and were 
considered as eligible. 
The Total Vaccinated Cohort (TVC) included all vaccinated subjects who received at least 1 dose of HZ/su 
or Placebo.  
In ZOSTER-002, the modified Total Vaccinated Cohort (mTVC) excluded subjects in the TVC who did not 
receive the second vaccination, who received vaccine doses or replacement not on the same group (i.e., 
randomization failures) or who developed a confirmed case of HZ prior to 1 month post Dose 2. In 
addition, subjects with relapse of the original malignancy or disease for which the autologous HSCT was 
undertaken were censored from the mTVC analysis from the date they started the therapy to treat 
relapse. 
The mTVC was the primary population for efficacy analyses. 
The results of the complementary efficacy analysis based on the TVC and on the According-To-Protocol 
(ATP) cohort for efficacy were consistent with results obtained for the mTVC. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 81/173 
 
 
  
  
In ZOSTER-039, the incidence of confirmed HZ cases was assessed in the TVC. For the post-hoc analysis 
of VE against HZ and to align with VE calculations as performed in other ZOSTER efficacy studies, an 
mTVC was defined post-hoc using the same criteria, i.e., excluding subjects from the TVC who did not 
receive the second vaccination or who developed a confirmed case of HZ prior to 30 days post Dose 2. 
The mTVC confirmed cases (ZOSTER-002) included subjects with at least one confirmed case of HZ and 
censored subjects as of the time a treatment for relapse of the underlying disease was initiated. The 
mTVC confirmed cases-HZ ZBPI Evaluable Subgroup included all subjects in the mTVC confirmed cases 
cohort who had a first ZBPI assessment within 14 days of rash onset. Both study cohorts were used to 
perform the QoL analyses in ZOSTER-002. 
Statistical methodology for analysis of efficacy 
In ZOSTER-002, all efficacy analyses were presented for the entire study population. Most efficacy 
analyses were also performed by age stratum (i.e., 18-49 YOA and ≥50 YOA), except for reduction of 
overall mortality and prevention of HZ during 1 year post-HSCT. The analysis of VE against HZ was 
additionally performed by region (Europe including South Africa, North America, South America and 
Austrasia), by duration of prophylactic antiviral therapy (PAT), and by detailed underlying disease 
category. Since the highest risk period for HZ reactivation is within the first year of autologous HSCT, an 
analysis was performed to evaluate VE in the prevention of HZ during the first year post-HSCT in 
ZOSTER-002. 
In ZOSTER-039, VE against HZ for the entire study population was conducted as a post-hoc analysis. 
All p-values reported were related to the null hypothesis test VE = 0 (or absence of effect of the vaccine). 
The confidence intervals (CIs) were produced with 5% α-level. 
Reduction in HZ risk, primary inferential analysis (Poisson method) 
The primary analysis method of VE was the Poisson method, which considered the exact inference on the 
relative risk (RR) conditionally to the total number of HZ cases observed and time at risk. Clinically 
meaningful overall efficacy of HZ/su against HZ was demonstrated if the lower limit (LL) of the 95% CI 
was >0%. 
The Poisson method computes an exact CI around the rate ratio (ratio of the event rates in the HZ/su 
versus Placebo group) and takes into account the sum of the time at risk of the subjects within each 
group. The RR was defined as the ratio of the incidence rates of the HZ/su group over the Placebo group, 
and VE was defined as 1 minus the RR. 
The time at risk was expressed in Person-Years and derived from the follow-up time (follow-up time in 
days/365.25). The follow-up time at risk period was expressed in days and, for mTVC, was considered as 
starting from the 30 days post Dose 2 date and ending on the date of the last visit/contact for subjects 
who did not have an event, on the last contact date for subjects who dropped out if not preceded by an 
event, or on the date of the event. 
The number of Person-Years at risk was defined as the sum of the time at risk for all subjects at risk 
during, either up to the cut-off date for the analysis (4 November 2016), the censoring date (drop-out) or 
the occurrence of the first HZ case for a subject. In addition, subjects with relapse of the original 
malignancy or disease for which the autologous HCT was undertaken were censored from the mTVC 
analysis from the date they started the therapy to treat relapse. 
For ZOSTER-039, VE against HZ was conducted as a post-hoc analysis in the way described above. 
Analyses were performed to determine the effect of HZ/su on the reduction of the duration of pain, the 
overall reduction in the risk of HZ-associated complications (other than PHN), the reduction in overall PHN 
risk, the reduction in PHN incidence in subjects with confirmed HZ, the reduction of overall and HZ-

related mortality and HZ-related hospitalizations, and the reduction of duration of pain medication in 
subjects with confirmed HZ. 
Statistical methodology for analysis of Quality of Life 
In ZOSTER-002, an exploratory analysis of QoL was performed: p-values from statistical tests were not 
considered confirmatory. 
Summary measures: 
Summary measures of QoL scores were generated. In essence, a summary measure collapses the 
complete set of measurements of an individual into a single number. For evaluable cases of HZ, the worst 
score for each QoL scale during the HZ episode was calculated and compared between study groups. The 
Wilcoxon non-parametric test was used to compare study groups as the summary measures were not 
expected to be normally distributed. 
Analysis of Quality of Life by ZBPI: 
Time to resolution of clinically significant pain was analyzed for the mTVC confirmed cases - ZBPI 
Evaluable Subgroup. Clinically significant pain was defined as pain with a ZBPI score ≥3. An event was 
defined as having a ‘worst’ pain score <3 for a documented 4-week clinically significant pain-free period. 
Time-to-event curves were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. A logrank test was used to 
compare study groups. 
As part of the area under the curve (AUC)-based analyses, the HZ severity-of-illness, severity-of-
interference, burden-of-illness, and burden-of-interference scores were calculated using either the ZBPI 
‘worst’ pain or average pain scores at 30, 90, or 182 days. 
Analysis of Quality of Life by SF-36 and EQ-5D: 
Analysis of repeated measures of QoL changes over time Data for HZ cases of the mTVC confirmed cases 
cohort were analyzed using descriptive statistics, repeated measures ANOVA, and a multivariate Rank 
Analysis for each study group at each assessment day, as described above for ZBPI. Both the mixed 
models and the multivariate Rank Analysis only included time points up to and including Week 10 post 
rash onset. 
A model was fitted to estimate the HZ impact on SF-36 and EQ-5D utility scores in the Placebo group only 
stratified by age (i.e., 18-49 YOA and ≥50 YOA). The model included the baseline utility scores, i.e., the 
most recent pre-HZ assessment (at one of Months 0, 2, or 13) and the utility scores during the first 4 
weeks of the HZ episode. 
Results 
ZOSTER-002: 
•  Studies’ dates 
The first subject was enrolled in the study on 13 July 2012 and the last study visit/contact was on 1 
February 2017. 
The cut-off date for final efficacy analysis (also referred to as ‘final triggered analysis’ or ‘final analysis’) 
was 04 November 2016. All suspected HZ episodes with onset date up to and including 04 November 
2016 were considered for efficacy analyses at the end of study.

Database freeze (DBF) occurred on 05 September 2017. 
Participant flow 
Study cohorts: 
There were 2000 subjects included in the Total Enrolled Cohort (subjects who signed the ICF and were 
considered as eligible). From the 2000 subjects included in the Total Enrolled Cohort, 154 subjects were 
not vaccinated and were not included in the TVC. These subjects were not vaccinated because they no 
longer met the eligibility criteria at the time of Visit 1. Out of these 154 subjects who were not 
vaccinated, 98 subjects were not randomized into a treatment group, 22 subjects were randomized into 
the HZ/su group, and 34 subjects were randomized into the Placebo group (Figure 3). Thus, a total of 
1846 subjects were vaccinated and constituted the TVC; 922 subjects in the HZ/su group and 924 in the 
Placebo group. 
Figure 3: Subject disposition: modified Total Vaccinated Cohort (Source: CSR Figure 3). 
Subjects who did not reach the cut-off date for final analysis: 
A total of 480 subjects included in the TVC (228 and 252 in the HZ/su group and Placebo group, 
respectively) did not reach the cut-off date for final analysis (04 November 2016) (Table 43).

HZ/su = Herpes Zoster sub-unit vaccine group; Placebo = Placebo group; Vaccinated = number of subjects who were vaccinated in 
the study; Completed =  number of subjects who completed until the cut-off date for final analysis (04NOV2019); Withdrawn =  
number of subjects who did not reach the cut-off date for final analysis (04NOV2019 
Until Visit 4 (Month 13), in the TVC there were 244 withdrawals from the study (115 and 129 in the 
HZ/su group and Placebo group, respectively). The most common reason for withdrawal until Visit 4 was 
the occurrence of an SAE (in total 132 subjects, 65 in the HZ/su group and 67 in the Placebo group). 
There were 28 withdrawals from the study (14 in each group) due to a non-serious AE. There were 4 
withdrawals due to the occurrence of a suspected HZ episode (1 in the HZ/su group and 3 in the Placebo 
group).  
Between Visit 4 and Visit 5 (Month 25), in the TVC there were 135 withdrawals (65 in the HZ/su group 
and 70 in the Placebo group) withdrawn. The most common reason for withdrawal was an SAE (in total 
73 subjects, 35 in the HZ/su group and 38 in the Placebo group). There were 12 withdrawals from the 
study (8 in the HZ/group and 4 in the Placebo group) due to a non-serious AE. There were 13 
withdrawals due to other reasons (6 in the HZ/su group and 7 in the Placebo group). For 4 of these 13 
subjects (2 in each group), the cut-off date for final analysis was reached before Visit 5 could take place.  
Between Visit 5 and the cut-off date for final analysis, in the TVC there were 101 withdrawals (48 in the 
HZ/su group and 53 in the Placebo group). For the time frame between Visit 5 and the cut-off date for 
final analysis, the reason for withdrawal was not to be documented in the eCRF. Out of these 101 
subjects, 49 subjects had fatal SAEs with an end date within this time frame (26 subjects in the HZ/su 
group and 23 subjects in the Placebo group).  
Subjects who did not receive the second vaccination: 
A total of 111 (6.0%) subjects out of 1846 included in the TVC did not receive the second vaccination; 
i.e., 49 (5.3%) out of 922 subjects in the HZ/su group and 62 (6.7%) out of 924 subjects in the Placebo 
group. The reasons, as reported in the eCRF, for subjects not having received the second dose were the 
following: At least one SAE and/or pIMD (6 subjects in each group); At least one non-serious AE (7 
subjects in the HZ/su group and 5 subjects in the Placebo group); A suspected HZ episode (criterion 1) (8 
subjects in the HZ/su group and 10 subjects in the Placebo group); Other reason (2 subjects in each 
group); The second vaccination visit (Visit 2) not performed (26 subjects in the HZ/su group and 39 
subjects in the Placebo group). 
mTVC and ATP: 
There were 870 subjects of the HZ/su group and 851 subjects of the Placebo group included in the mTVC.  
Additional criteria were applied to exclude subjects from the ATP cohort for efficacy. There were 682 
subjects of the HZ/su group and 672 subjects of the Placebo group included in the ATP cohort of efficacy. 
The reasons for elimination from ATP were: (i) blinded study vaccine not administered according to the 
protocol (reconstitution of the vaccine not performed as per protocol, vaccine administered using a 
subcutaneous needle), (ii) vaccine administered despite a temperature deviation qualified by status QA 
GMP non-use, (iii) vaccine administered out of the expiration date, (iv) administration of vaccine(s) 
forbidden in the protocol, (v) randomisation code broken at the investigator site or at GSK safety 
department, (vi) protocol violation linked to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, (vii) administration of any 
medication forbidden by the protocol (excluding those used for disease progression or relapse), (viii) non-
compliance with vaccination schedule (including wrong and unknown vaccination dates).

Conduct of the study 
There were no significant audit findings that impacted the validity of the data collected. Among the audit 
findings, 2 findings were found relevant. During the conduct of ZOSTER-002, the following incidents were 
identified by GSK after 2 for-cause CDQA site assessments: 
- An internal audit was conducted by GSK at one United Kingdom (UK) site following the notification of a 
serious breach to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. This site enrolled 5 out of 
the 1846 subjects included in the study. Findings from the internal audit included documentation 
deficiencies and other issues (including retrieval of diary cards, missed monthly contacts and out of 
window study visits). Based on the corrective and preventive actions implemented at this site, the study 
team considered that the GCP concerns were adequately addressed and data collected at the site were 
reliable and accurate and thus included in all analyses. 
- At one site in New Zealand, an internal audit identified issues related to lack of evidence of Principal 
Investigator (PI) oversight at the site, documentation deficiencies, issues with temperature monitoring of 
vaccines and lack of monitoring oversight by the site. The site enrolled 3 out of the 1846 subjects 
included in the study. Despite the corrective actions put in place, significant weaknesses persisted, and it 
was decided to close the site after all subjects completed 1 year of follow-up after last dose as no other PI 
could be appointed to this site according to the institution. As all safety data had been correctly reported 
in the electronic Case Report Form (eCRF) and reviewed by medically trained site staff, the study team 
decided that the data could be used for all analyses. 
Baseline data 
Analysis of demographic characteristics overall: 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 86/173 
 
 
  
  
 
The summary of demographic characteristics (age in years at first vaccination, gender, ethnicity and 
geographic ancestry) for the TVC and the mTVC is presented respectively in Table 45 and Table 46. 
Regarding the TVC, mean age was 54.8 years and 55.1 years for the HZ/su and Placebo groups, 
respectively, and regarding the mTVC, mean age was 54.9 years and 55.1 years for the HZ/su and 
Placebo groups, respectively. More male than female subjects were included in each cohort in both the 
HZ/su group and the Placebo group in the TVC and mTVC. Regarding TVC and mTVC, percentages of 
subjects with geographical ancestry and ethnicity characteristics as specified, appeared to be similar in 
the HZ/su and Placebo groups.

Analysis of demographic characteristics by age stratum and by underlying diseases: 
For the mTVC, regarding the 18-49 YOA stratum, mean age was 38.5 years and 39.0 years for HZ/su and 
Placebo group, respectively; regarding the ≥50 YOA stratum, mean age was 60.2 years and 60.4 years 
for the HZ/su and Placebo group, respectively. For the mTVC, the percentage of female/male subjects in 
the HZ/su group was 40.4%/59.6% and 36.1%/63.9% for the 18-49 YOA and the ≥50 YOA strata, 
respectively; and in the Placebo group, 40.6%/59.4% and 36.2%/63.8% for the 18-49 YOA and the ≥50 
YOA strata, respectively. For the mTVC, regarding the multiple myeloma stratum, mean age was 58.8 
years and 58.6 years for HZ/su and Placebo group, respectively; regarding the other diagnoses stratum, 
mean age was 50.2 years and 50.8 years for the HZ/su and Placebo group, respectively. For the mTVC, 
the percentage of female/male subjects in the HZ/su group was 36.0%/64.0% and 38.4%/61.6% for the 
multiple myeloma and the other diagnoses strata, respectively; and in the Placebo group, 39.1%/60.9% 
and 35.0%/65.0% for the multiple myeloma and the other diagnoses strata, respectively. 
Distribution of subjects by type of IS treatment: 
Subjects of the pivotal studies were all on IS treatment for their underlying disease during the vaccination 
course or prior to vaccination. The distribution of subjects receiving IS treatment, classified by IS 
ingredient sub-class, is presented below. In ZOSTER-002, subjects received pre-and post-transplant IS 
regimen and/or post-transplant maintenance chemotherapy. From 30 days prior to HSCT up to 1 month 
post Dose 2 in the mTVC, the following ingredient subclasses of IS treatment were most frequently 
administered (by >20% of subjects in the HZ/su group): nitrogen and mustard analogues (96.3%), 
topoisomerase inhibitors (38.4%), pyrimidine analogues (33.1%) and nitrosoureas (32.0%). Results were 
in the same range for subjects in the HZ/su and Placebo groups. Post-transplant antineoplastic therapy 
with bortezomib was included as a separate minimization category because of the well-documented 
increased risk of HZ in persons treated with bortezomib. 
Other clinical characteristics:

The median (Min.-Max.) duration of anti-VZV prophylaxis use after 1 month post Dose 2 excluding the 
subjects who never had Prophylaxis therapy during the same period was 57.0 days (1.0-1121.0) and 
53.0 days (1.0-1442.0 (mTVC). 
Numbers analysed 
Of the 184 subjects with confirmed HZ episodes, 49 were in the HZ/su group and 135 in the Placebo 
group. Confirmed HZ episodes that occurred after start of treatment for relapse were not considered in 
this analysis. The overall incidence of HZ per 1000 person-years was 30.0 in the HZ/su group and 94.3 in 
the Placebo group. 
Outcomes and estimation 
a)  modified Total Vaccinated Cohort analysis 
HZ VE 
HZ VE overall 
HZ VE of 68.17% (95% CI: 55.56% - 77.53%; P<0.0001). The primary objective of the study was met 
since the LL of the 95% CI was above 0%. 
Table 47: Vaccine efficacy: First or only episode of HZ during the entire study period using 
Poisson method (modified Total Vaccinated Cohort)  
HZ/su = Herpes Zoster sub-unit vaccine group; Placebo = Placebo group; N = total number of subjects; n = number of subjects 
having at least one confirmed HZ episode; T (year) = sum of follow/up period (censored at the first occurrence of a confirmed HZ 
episode and at the occurrence of treatment for relapse) expressed in years; (n/T (per 1000) = Incidence rate of subjects reporting at 
least one event; LL, UL =  95% Lower and Upper confidence limits; VE (%) = Vaccine Efficacy (Poisson method); P-value = Two side 
Exact P-value conditional to number of cases 
For all subjects in the mTVC, the median follow-up time (from 30 days post-dose 2 until last contact 
documented in conclusion screens but limited until 04 November 2016) was approximately 21 months; 
with approximately 22 months in the HZ/su group and approximately 20 months in the Placebo group. 
Overall, the maximum follow-up time was 50 months after 30 days post-dose 2, with 49 months in the 
HZ/su group and 50 months in the Placebo group.

A sensitivity analysis was conducted on the mTVC including confirmed HZ episodes which occurred after 
the subject had started therapy to treat relapse. The HZ VE (first or only episode of HZ) during the entire 
study period including confirmed HZ episodes which occurred after the subject had started therapy to 
treat relapse was 67.34% (95% CI: 55.07% - 76.56%). Of the 199 subjects with confirmed HZ episodes, 
54 were in the HZ/su group and 145 in the Placebo group. Compared to the analysis addressing the 
primary objective, there were 5 additional subjects with confirmed HZ episodes in the HZ/su group and 
10 additional subjects with confirmed HZ episodes in the Placebo group; for these subjects confirmed HZ 
episodes were initiated after treatment for relapse. 
Regarding the confirmed HZ episodes from subjects in the mTVC (including these confirmed HZ episodes 
that occurred after treatment for relapse), further details are provided:  
- 
There were 3 subjects in the Placebo group and no subjects in the HZ/su group with more than one 
confirmed HZ episode (there were 2 confirmed HZ episodes for each of the 3 subjects in the Placebo 
group). One of these 3 subjects had a first HZ episode before treatment for relapse and another 
episode after treatment for relapse. The 2 other subjects had 2 HZ episodes before treatment for 
relapse. 
-  Of the suspected HZ episodes, in the HZ/su group 54 (73.0%) were confirmed HZ episodes, in the 
Placebo group 148 (77.9%) were confirmed HZ episodes.  
There were a total of 202 confirmed HZ cases, of which 167 were confirmed by PCR and 35 were 
confirmed by HZAC. In the HZ/su group, of the 54 confirmed HZ cases, 45 were confirmed cases by PCR 
and 9 by HZAC. In the Placebo group, of the 148 confirmed HZ cases, 122 were confirmed cases by PCR 
and 26 by HZAC. The additional 35 cases determined by HZAC could not be classified by PCR (samples 
were inadequate or no samples were available). HZ episodes, confirmed by PCR or HZAC, and with a 
clinical presentation of disseminated rash at onset, could have constituted a primary VZV infection 
(varicella). In such cases, a per-protocol defined algorithm was applied. In the mTVC, for 3 subjects in

the HZ/su group, and 12 subjects in the Placebo group this algorithm was applied and all 15 cases were 
confirmed as HZ.

Additional stratified analyses 
No apparent differences were observed for VE against HZ across regions i.e., Europe, North America and 
Austrasia. Of note, VE was not calculated for South America because of the few subjects enrolled and the 
absence of confirmed HZ cases in this region.

Reduction of pain, PHN, HZ-associated complications, hospitalisation, and mortality 
The reduction of duration of severe ‘worst’ HZ-associated pain in subjects with a confirmed HZ episode is 
presented below.

HZ/su = Herpes Zoster sub-unit vaccine group; Placebo = Placebo group; Duration = The last day with severe worst pain – The first 
day with severe worst pain + 1 (worst duration if more than 1 confirmed HZ episode); N = total number of subjects with at least one 
confirmed HZ episode with severe “worsts” HZ-associated pain; Nmiss = number of subjects with at least one confirmed HZ episode 
without sever “worst” HZ-associated pain; SD = standard deviation  
Pain duration was reduced in vaccinated vs. Placebo confirmed HZ cases. At least one day of severe 
‘worst’ HZ-associated pain (defined as ZBPI pain scores of 3 or more on the ‘worst’ pain ZBPI question) 
was reported in 76% and 89% of the subjects who had confirmed HZ in the HZ/su vs. Placebo group. The 
median (min - max) duration of severe ‘worst’ HZ-associated pain was 14.0 (1.0 - 178.0) days in the 
HZ/su group and 24.0 (1.0 -1025.0) days in the Placebo group. 
In the mTVC at least one HZ complication was observed in 3 out of 870 subjects of the HZ/su group and 
13 out of 851 subjects of the Placebo group (Table 57). Reported HZ complications were HZ 
meningoencephalitis (1 subject in the Placebo group) and HZ cutaneous disseminated (3 subjects in the 
HZ/su group and 12 subjects in the Placebo group). This analysis excluded HZ complications that were 
linked to a confirmed HZ case that occurred after the start of the treatment for relapse. 
Table 57 presents results on PHN VE (first or only episode of PHN) using the Poisson method, of the 10 
subjects with PHN episodes in the mTVC, 1 was in the HZ/su group and 9 were in the Placebo group. This 
table also presents the VE in reduction of PHN incidence in subjects with a confirmed HZ episode. 
HZ-related mortality was not observed in the autologous HCT recipients ≥ 18 YOA. The reduction of 
overall and confirmed HZ episode related mortality and hospitalizations is presented in the tables below.

approximately 27 months in the HZ/su group and approximately 24 months in the Placebo group. Overall, 
the maximum follow-up time was approximately 52 months, with 51 months in the HZ/su group and 52 
months in the Placebo group. Overall HZ VE results obtained for the TVC were consistent with results 
obtained for the mTVC.

d)  QUALITY OF LIFE RESULTS 002 
All the QoL analyses (of tertiary endpoints including by subgroup analyses) were exploratory. The study 
was not designed to draw confirmatory conclusions on these analyses as no control of type I error was 
done. A summary of the results of the QoL analyses is presented: 
•  Consistent differences were observed in favor of the HZ/su group compared to the Placebo group 
• 
• 
when measuring pain associated with the HZ episode using the ZBPI. 
The overall VE estimate for the ZBPI burden-of-illness score was 82.5% (95% CI: 73.6% - 91.4%). 
The overall VE estimate for the ZBPI burden-of-interference score was 82.8% (95% CI: 73.3% - 
92.3%). 
The median time to resolution of clinically significant pain was 20 days in the HZ/su group and 31 
days in the Placebo Group. 
•  Consistent differences were observed in favor of the HZ/su group compared to the Placebo group in 
the AUC scores for the ZBPI worst pain score, ZBPI average pain score, and ZBPI ADL score for all of 
the time periods, i.e., 30, 90 and 182 days suggesting that the severity of disease was reduced in the 
HZ/su group compared with the Placebo group. 
•  Some differences were observed between HZ/su and Placebo groups, in favor of HZ/su, when 
analyzing the SF-36 and EQ-5D scales, particularly at Week 1 of the HZ episode. No consistent 
differences in favour of either group were observed at other timepoints suggesting that the largest 
differences between HZ/su and Placebo groups in the impact on QoL were observed in the first week 
of the HZ episode. 
• 
The estimated HZ Disutility Score by age group and timepoint assessed using the EQ-5D in the 
Placebo Group was estimated as -0.3328 (95% CI: -0.4383, -0.2274) and -0.2406 (95% CI: -0.3035,

-0.1778) on Day 0 in the age groups 18-49 YOA and ≥50 YOA, respectively, suggesting a major 
impact on QoL due to the HZ episode for non-vaccinated subjects.

Out of the 283 and 279 subjects from the HZ/su and Placebo groups, respectively, included in the TVC, 
252 and 239 were included in the ATP cohort for safety up to 30 days post-last vaccination. The following 
protocol deviations leading to elimination from this ATP cohort were: (i) administered concomitant 
vaccine(s) forbidden in the protocol up to 30 days post last vaccination, (ii) randomization code broken, 
(iii) vaccine administered not according to protocol, (iv) protocol violation linked to the inclusion/exclusion 
criteria including age. 
Baseline data 
The summary of demographic characteristics by timing of vaccination in relation to the cancer therapy 
cycle indicates that vaccination was done: During the cancer treatment for 102 vs. 106 subjects in the 
HZ/su and Placebo groups respectively; After the cancer treatment for 181 vs. 173 subjects in the HZ/su 
and Placebo groups respectively. 
Findings are similar in the mTVC. 
From 1 year prior to Dose 1 up to 1 month post Dose 2, the following subclasses of IS cancer therapy 
were most frequently administered (by >20% of subjects in the HZ/su group): nitrogen and mustard 
analogues (55.7%), anthracyclines (42.4%), antimitotic agents including antimicrotubule agents 
(34.4%), anti CD20 (28.6%), and pyrimidine analogues (22.9%). Results were in the same range for 
subjects in the HZ/su and Placebo groups.

Ancillary analyses 
Correlate of protection analysis: 
In the Cohort for correlate of protection (CCP), there were a total of 14 confirmed HZ cases, 2 confirmed 
HZ cases in the HZ/su group and 12 confirmed HZ cases in the Placebo group. The GMCs of anti-gE Ab at 
1 month after receiving 2 doses of HZ/su in subjects who later developed confirmed HZ (HZ/su cases - 2 
subjects) and in those who did not develop confirmed HZ (HZ/su Non-cases) in the 1 year follow-up were 
184 and 12517.4, respectively. The fold increase in GMCs at 1 month after receiving 2 doses of HZ/su 
compared with baseline values was 1.59 times for confirmed HZ/su cases and 13.07 times for confirmed 
HZ/su Non-cases, respectively. 
Occurrence of HZ and HZ-related complications, in the other studies:  
In ZOSTER-028 and ZOSTER-041, the occurrence of suspected HZ and/or HZ complications constituted 
an AE or SAE, as appropriate. HZ complications, including but not limited to PHN (see above for ZOSTER-
002), HZ vasculitis, disseminated disease, ophthalmic disease, neurologic disease, and visceral disease, 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 102/173 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
were recorded by the investigator and considered as AEs or SAEs as appropriate. The reporting period for 
cases of HZ was from Month 0 to study end. 
Suspected HZ was defined as onset of a rash characteristic of HZ (i.e., unilateral, dermatomal and 
accompanied by pain broadly defined to include allodynia, pruritus or other sensations), or a vesicular 
rash suggestive of VZV infection regardless of the dermatomal distribution, and without alternative 
diagnosis. Additionally, sometimes HZ cases do not present with the characteristic HZ or VZV rash, but 
have a clinical presentation and specific laboratory tests suggestive of VZV infection. These cases were 
also to be considered as occurrences of HZ.  
In study ZOSTER-028, there were 1 and 2 suspected HZ episode in the HZ/su and placebo groups 
respectively. In study ZOSTER-041, there were 3 and 7 suspected HZ episode in the HZ/su and placebo 
groups respectively. None of the HZ cases were assessed by the investigator as causally related to 
vaccination and all cases recovered/resolved by the end of the study. 
In study ZOSTER-028, no suspected HZ cases were reported as SAE.  
In study ZOSTER-041, of the 7 placebo recipients who reported suspected HZ cases, 4 were reported as 
SAEs. All the subjects presenting with itching and pain. One developed a mild-grade 1, two a moderate-
grade 2 and one a severe-grade 3 HZ. No complications were notified. No subjects in the HZ/su group 
reported HZ cases that were SAEs.

to the placebo group (10.2% vs. 27.4%). The VE (95% CI) was 22.5 (-
15.9-48.1). The duration of pain medication was shorter in the HZ/su group 
(median 21.5 days [min – max: 1.0 –436.0]) compared with the Placebo 
group (median 47.5 [min - max 1.0 – 1642.0]). 
The vaccine efficacy against first or only episode of confirmed HZ-related 
hospitalizations was 84.70% (95% CI: 32.15% - 96.55%) during the entire 
study period.

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Design: 
ZOSTER-002 and ZOSTER-039 were phase III, randomised, observer-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multicentre, multi-country (28 and 21 countries respectively) trials to assess Shingrix when administered 
intramuscularly on a two-dose schedule respectively to adults recipients of autologous haematopoietic 
stem cell transplant (HCT) and to adults with hematologic malignancies. ZOSTER-002 was primarily 
conducted to evaluate the efficacy of Shingrix in the prevention of HZ, while in ZOSTER-039, HZ efficacy 
analyses were performed post-hoc. 
Populations: 
The ZOSTER-002 study population consisted in subjects aged 18 years or older who had undergone 
autologous HCT or for whom autologous HCT was planned, and with no plan for an additional HCTs. The 
first vaccination had to be done 50-70 days after HCT. HCT recipients are usually not vaccinated as early 
after transplant, as immunological responses continue to improve during the 1-2 years period following 
transplant. However, this time interval respective to HCT for the first vaccine dose is considered justified, 
based on the high short term risk of VZV reactivation and based on the immunogenicity results (see 
immunogenicity section).  
The ZOSTER-039 study population consisted in subjects aged 18 years or older who had been diagnosed 
with an haematologic malignancy and who were receiving, were scheduled to receive, or had just finished 
immunosuppressive cancer therapy (defined as chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy). If each cancer 
therapy treatment cycle was separated by at least 20 days, the first vaccination had to be done as late as 
possible after a cycle while still allowing 10 days before the next foreseen cycle. If this was not possible, 
the first vaccination had to be scheduled from 10 days to 6 months after the full cancer therapy course. 
The same approach applied to the second dose.  
In ZOSTER-002, subjects were excluded if prophylactic antiviral therapy with activity against VZV was 
expected to last more than 6 months after transplantation. In ZOSTER-039, subjects with a planned HCT 
during the study period were excluded. Those who had a HCT prior to enrolment could be included. In 
both studies, subjects were excluded if they were vaccinated against HZ or varicella within the 12 months 
preceding the first dose of study vaccine/placebo, or if they had presented a varicella or HZ episode by 
clinical history within the 12 months preceding the first dose of study vaccine/placebo. 
Inclusion/exclusion criteria are appropriate. The MAH did not exclude all individuals who were 
administered a varicella vaccine in the past. The literature indicates that HZ cases are reported in 
individuals vaccinated against varicella, although at a much lower incidence than in non-vaccinated. See 
also immunogenicity and safety discussion. 
Vaccination schedule: 
The primary vaccination schedule for Shingrix consists of two doses separated by 2 months. If flexibility 
in the vaccination schedule is necessary, the second dose can be administered between 2 and 6 months 
after the first dose (section 5.1 of SmPC). In the pivotal trials of this application, the MAH used a 2-dose 
schedule with an interval of 1-2 month between doses. The selection of this schedule allows for a flexible 
administration in IC individuals, who can be at short term risk of HZ. 
Objective and endpoints: 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 107/173 
 
 
  
  
The primary objective of ZOSTER-002 was to estimate VE in reducing the risk of developing HZ. The 
criterion used to demonstrate efficacy (lower limit of the 95% CI above 0%) is considered acceptable. 
The trial secondarily aimed at evaluating VE in the prevention of PHN, in reducing the incidence of HZ-
associated complications, and in reducing the total duration of severe ‘worst’ HZ-associated pain. 
ZOSTER-002 also included an comprehensive set of relevant tertiary objectives, including the evaluation 
of VE in: (i) reducing the duration of severe HZ-associated pain, the severity of HZ-associated acute pain, 
and the duration of pain medication, in subjects with confirmed HZ; (ii) preventing HZ 1 year post-HSCT, 
(iii) improving QoL in subjects with confirmed HZ, (iv) reducing HZ-related hospitalizations and mortality, 
(v) preventing PHN in subjects with confirmed HZ. 
Although HZ by itself is a mild disease, VZV reactivation can have serious complications such as PHN and 
HZ ophtalmicus (HZO), PHN being the most frequent. The neuropathic pain associated with PHN may be 
severe and persistent, particularly in IC patients, and is often very resistant to treatment. Preventing 
PHN, as well as other severe complications of VZV reactivation is regarded as much more clinically 
relevant than preventing HZ per se. Nevertheless, considering PHN as a secondary endpoint is 
acceptable, as the endpoint ‘HZ’ can be ascertained in a more robust manner (PCR assays). The 
secondary endpoint ‘PHN’ more clinically relevant but more prone to misclassification. 
Overall, these objectives are endorsed as they allow for a comprehensive assessment of the effect of 
HZ/su with respect to HZ. 
ZOSTER-039 was conducted to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of HZ/su in patients 18 years of 
age and older diagnosed with haematologic malignancies. The description of the incidence of confirmed 
HZ cases was part of the secondary objectives. The analysis of VE was a post-hoc exploratory analysis.  
In ZOSTER-002 and ZOSTER-039, a suspected case of HZ was defined as: (i) a new rash characteristic of 
HZ (unilateral and accompanied by pain, broadly defined), (ii) or a vesicular rash suggestive of VZV 
infection regardless of the distribution, and with no alternative diagnosis, (iii) or a clinical presentation 
and specific laboratory findings suggestive of VZV infection in the absence of characteristic HZ or VZV 
rash. The definition is thus broader than that used in ZOSTER-006/ZOSTER-022 trials (which was 
restricted to rash characteristic of HZ), and as such, takes account of the atypical clinical presentations of 
HZ in IC patients including zoster sine herpete (ZSH) and disseminated HZ. The additional components 
(ii) and (iii) of the definition of a suspected case are potentially more prone to misclassification, but 
clinically relevant in IC patients. VZV reactivation can produce chronic radicular pain as well as all the 
neurological disorders associated with HZ without rash (ZSH) 1.  
In ZOSTER-002 and ZOSTER-039, for suspected cases with a typical HZ rash, the confirmation of HZ was 
done in a similar way as in ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022. Subjects with symptoms suggestive of HZ 
were to be examined by investigators preferably within 96 hours. Clinically suspect cases were 
documented by digital photography and rash lesion samples were collected. HZ episodes were confirmed 
using PCR as the primary method of confirmation, or by the HZ Adjudication Committee (HZAC) if it was 
not possible to confirm by PCR. For suspected cases of HZ who could potentially constitute a primary VZV 
infection (varicella), baseline VZV serology was taken into account to determine whether the case was 
considered a confirmed case of HZ. In case of suspected HZ diagnosed without characteristic HZ or VZV 
rash, the HZAC classification had to serve as the final case confirmation. These cases were recorded as 
(S)AEs. 
In ZOSTER-002, subjects with confirmed HZ were followed up for at least 90 days, and had to complete a 
Zoster Brief Pain Inventory (ZBPI) questionnaire to collect information on the severity and duration of the

HZ-associated pain. The Company also used the Euro-QoL 5 Dimension (EQ-5D) and Short form-36 (SF-
36) questionnaires which are standardized non disease-specific instruments for describing and valuing 
health-related quality of life (HRQoL). These tools were also used in ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022. 
In ZOSTER-002, PHN was defined by the presence of HZ-associated ‘worst’ pain persisting or appearing 
more than 90 days after onset of the HZ rash. ‘Worst’ pain was defined as HZ-associated pain rated as 3 
or greater on the ‘worst’ pain ZBPI question. This definition is identical to the one used in the ZOSTER-
006/ZOSTER-022 trials.  
In contrast to ZOSTER-002, in ZOSTER-039, there were no planned follow-up visits for HZ cases, and no 
ZBPI questionnaires were completed. In this study, PHN was defined as clinically significant pain or 
painful abnormal sensations (e.g., allodynia or itch) that persisted 3 months or more after HZ rash onset.  
Any other HZ-associated complications, according to a pre-defined protocol list, had to be recorded by the 
investigator. These complications included HZ vasculitis, disseminated disease, ophthalmic disease, 
neurologic disease including stroke, and visceral disease which in the opinion of the investigator, was 
caused directly by the VZV infection arising from the HZ episode. The definitions are similar as in the 
pivotal trials 006/022. HZ complications were considered as AEs or SAEs in ZOSTER-039, and only SAEs 
in ZOSTER-002. HZ complications associated with confirmed HZ were considered for analysis of the 
applicable secondary endpoint (ZOSTER-002). 
Overall, efficacy endpoints are relevant and well defined. Study procedures to ascertain these endpoints 
are carefully designed and robust. Methods used to confirm HZ are similar in both studies, and similar to 
those used in the pivotal ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 trials, except for cases without a typical HZ rash. 
PHN was more appropriately defined in ZOSTER-002, based on a standardised tool to assess pain. HZ 
complications were collected in both studies based on a similar predefined list. In addition, in ZOSTER-
002, the MAH undertook a comprehensive assessment of HZ-associated pain and impact on quality of life 
by using appropriate tools.  
Randomisation: 
Eligible subjects were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to either the gE/AS01B group or the placebo group. In 
ZOSTER-002, the randomisation algorithm used a minimisation procedure accounting for relevant factors, 
i.e. which predict the risk of HZ: (i) age (18-49 YOA and ≥50 YOA), (ii) underlying-disease (multiple 
myeloma vs. other diagnoses), (iii) post-transplant antineoplastic therapy (given the well-documented 
increased risk of HZ in persons treated with bortezomib, the included factor was bortezomib at the time 
of first vaccination, yes or vs no), (iv) anticipated duration of post-transplant antiviral prophylaxis (up to 
and including 3 months vs more than 3 months up to and including 6 months), (v) center, (vi) gender. In 
ZOSTER-039, enrolment was performed to ensure equal distribution of the population between the study 
groups across three underlying disease strata. In addition, within each underlying disease stratum, the 
randomisation algorithm used a minimisation procedure accounting for the timing of study vaccination in 
relation to the particular immunosuppressive cancer therapy cycle. 
Only a limited number of characteristics could be included in the algorithm, and given the heterogeneity 
of the population, residual confounding is still possible. It is acknowledged that the inclusion of ‘center’ in 
the minimization procedure may attenuate the risk of potential imbalances, as all treatments were given 
according to local standard of care. 
Statistical methods: 
In ZOSTER-002, the modified Total Vaccinated Cohort (mTVC) was the primary population for efficacy 
analyses which excluded subjects in the TVC who were not administered with the second vaccination or 
who developed a confirmed HZ prior to 1 month after the second vaccination. Subjects with relapse of the 
original malignancy or disease for which the HCT was undertaken were censored from the mTVc analysis

as of the time they initiated the therapy to treat relapse. The primary analysis of VE was performed using 
the Poisson method. Clinically meaningful overall efficacy of HZ/su against HZ was demonstrated if the 
lower limit (LL) of the 95% CI was >0%, which is considered acceptable. 
For ZOSTER-039, the incidence of confirmed HZ cases was evaluated as a secondary objective while VE 
was evaluated post hoc, in a mTVCdefined post-hoc using the same criteria as in ZOSTER-002, with 
similar statistical methods as in ZOSTER-002. 
Cohort of analyses and statistical methods are endorsed. The approach is consistent with the VE analyses 
performed in the other efficacy studies (ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
ZOSTER-002: 
A total of 1846 subjects were vaccinated and constituted the TVC (922 and 924 respectively in subjects in 
the HZ/su and Placebo groups). Of the subjects in the TVC, 24.7% and 27.3% withdrew before the cut-off 
date for final analysis respectively in the HZ/su and placebo groups. The main reasons for withdrawal 
(SAE, non-serious AE, protocol violation, consent withdrawal, moved from study area, lost to follow-up, 
suspected HZ episode) were balanced between groups.  
Of the subjects in the TVC, 5.3% and 6.7% did not receive the second dose respectively in the HZ/su and 
Placebo groups and were excluded from the mTVC. For 2 subjects in the HZ/su group and 10 subjects in 
the Placebo group, an episode of confirmed HZ was reported within 30 days post-last vaccination; these 
subjects were also excluded from the mTVC. Two additional subjects (one in each group) were excluded 
because they received vaccine doses or replacement not on the same group. This resulted in 870 subjects 
of the HZ/su group and 851 subjects of the Placebo group included in the mTVC. 
In the TVC and the mTVC, subjects had on average 55 YOA, and 63% were female. Groups were 
balanced with respect to demographic characteristics, including within each strata (18-49 YOA, ≥50 YOA). 
Most of the subjects were seropositive at baseline (anti-gE Ab titers ≥97 IU/ml), in both arms, suggesting 
that most of the subjects included in the study experienced a previous natural infection with VZV. The 
underlying diagnoses were evenly distributed across groups, the most represented diseases being 
multiple myeloma (54% vs. 55%) and non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma (27% vs. 29%). It was also 
observed that 52% vs. 50% of the subjects respectively in the HZ/su and Placebo groups did not receive 
Prophylactic Antiviral Therapy, 26% vs. 31% received up to 60 days of Prophylactic Antiviral Therapy, 
and 22% vs. 19% received >60 days of Prophylactic Antiviral Therapy. For subjects who received PAT the 
median duration of treatment was similar across groups.  
Most (>99%) subjects received at least one IS treatment (during at least one 1 day) from 30 days prior 
to HSCT up to 30 days after Dose 2. However, only 22.5% and 22.1% of the subjects received at least 
one IS treatment from HSCT up to 30 days after Dose 2 (mTVC). The treatments received by >10% of 
subjects in the HZ/su group) were nitrogen and mustard analogues (96.3% vs. 97.2%), topoisomerase 
inhibitors (38.3% vs. 38.2%), pyrimidine analogues (33.1% vs. 32.7%), nitrosoureas (32.0% vs. 
32.4%), anti-TNF non-monoclonal antibodies (14.7% vs 14.8%), other alkylating agents (11.0% vs. 
11.3%). Data on therapies were recorded starting from 30 days prior to HSCT. Only 14% of the subjects 
received anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody within the interval between 30 days prior to HSCT up to blood 
sample 1 month post Dose 2 (not reported for the other diseases). It is however likely that most patients 
with NHBCL received rituximab in the period before transplant. The groups were balanced with respect to 
these treatments. However, these data are presented irrespective of duration and time interval to

vaccination, and thus say nothing about concomitant therapies, or about therapies given shortly before or 
after vaccination.  
Of the suspected HZ episodes, 54 (73.0%) and 148 (77.9%) in the HZ/su and the Placebo group 
respectively were confirmed HZ episodes. Most of the 202 confirmed HZ episodes were confirmed by PCR 
(83% and 82% the HZ/su and Placebo groups). The other episodes were determined by HZAC only, as 
samples were inadequate or no samples were available for PCR. Three subjects in the Placebo group 
(none in the HZ/su group) had more than one confirmed HZ episode. There were 3 subjects in the HZ/su 
group, and 12 subjects in the Placebo group with a clinical presentation of disseminated rash at onset. A 
per-protocol defined algorithm was applied to determine whether the episode consisted in a primary VZV 
infection (varicella) or a VZV reactivation. Pre-existing immunity was taken into account. All the cases 
were confirmed as HZ. 
The ‘mTVC confirmed cases’ included 49 and 135 subjects who presented at least one confirmed episode 
of HZ, respectively in the HZ/su and Placebo groups. The overall incidence of HZ per 1000 person-years 
was 30.0 in the HZ/su group and 94.3 in the Placebo group, over a median FU time of 21 months. The 
incidence of HZ in the ZOSTER-002 Placebo group was similar to that found in the ZOSTER-039 Placebo 
group (70.9 per 1000 person-years, see below), and 10-fold higher compared to the incidence of HZ in 
the ZOSTER-006 Placebo group (9.1 per 1000 person-years), which used a similar case-definition for HZ. 
As a reminder, immunocompromised patients and patients with HZ history were excluded from ZOSTER-
006, in addition, patients with comorbidities affecting immunity were most probably underrepresented in 
this trial. Data from studies licensure trials and trials submitted in this application are in line with the 
literature. In a systematic review based on 11 European studies, the incidence rate of HZ increases 
sharply with age for individuals older than 50 years, and is estimated at around 7-8 per 10002,3). 
According to the literature review presented by the MAH in the Clinical Overview, patients who undergo 
HSCT show the highest risk for HZ among the IC conditions with incidence rate 37 to 60 cases per 1000 
person-year, especially during the first year following transplantation (cumulative incidence 8-28%). 
In ZOSTER-002, overall HZ VE in autologous HCT adult patients was 68.17% (95% CI: 55.56% - 
77.53%) over 21 months The primary objective of the study was met (LL of the 95% CI above 0%). As a 
reminder, in ZOSTER-006, VE against HZ in adults ≥50 YOA was 97.16% (95% CI: 93.72 to 98.97), over 
a median follow-up period of 3.1 years. Analysis of VE against HZ in ≥70 YOA using pooled ZOSTER-006 
and ZOSTER-022 data (co-primary objective) was 91.30% (95% CI: 86.88 to 94.46). 
There were 5 and 10 additional subjects with confirmed HZ episodes after treatment for relapse was 
initiated, respectively in the HZ/su and Placebo group, which were censored in the mTVC. A sensitivity 
analysis indicates that the VE was similar when including these cases (HZ VE 67.34% [95% CI: 55.07% - 
76.56%]).  
The HZ VE was 76.15% (95% CI: 61.11% - 85.98%) during 1 year post-HCT (that is the period of 
highest HZ’s risk for HCT patients) (median follow-up time 7.6 months). Given the overall HZ VE of 
68.17% (95% CI: 55.56% - 77.53% (median FU time of 231 months), this suggests that VE may 
decrease over time. The MAH does not plan to assess long-term vaccine efficacy of Shingrix in IC subjects 
enroled in studies ZOSTER-002, ZOSTER-028 and ZOSTER-039 as no conclusion on the long-term efficacy 
would be possible due to variability of the immune status that evolves over time depending on the clinical 
outcome. The number of patients enrolled in study ZOSTER-041 is too limited (approximatively 130 
subjects/group) to estimate long-term efficacy. The absence of long-term efficacy follow-up in IC patients 
is therefore deemed acceptable, also considering that efficacy was demonstrated in subjects at high risk 
of HZ and during the period they were at their highest risk of HZ and that effectiveness may be evaluated

in the EPI-ZOSTER-031 effectiveness study.  The MAH considers that, in contrast, patients enrolled in 
study ZOSTER-041 have a relatively stable immune status. Long-term immunogenicity is being assessed 
in this population (see immuno discussion). 
HZ VE was stable across age stratum (18-49 YOA vs. ≥50 YOA), and slightly higher in females compared 
to males. However, 95% CI largely overlapped. A difference was observed with respect to the different 
underlying malignancies. VE was higher in the subgroup of MM patients compared with all other 
diagnoses, i.e. 72.35% (95% CI: 54.76% -83.71%) versus 63.63% (95% CI: 42.29% - 77.66%). It 
should be noted that the observed efficacy difference is small and 95% CIs are overlapping. Overall, the 
stratified analyses do not point to an issue of lack of VE for specific underlying diseases, but estimates are 
imprecise. In contrast, vaccine-induced gE-specific Ab concentrations were not always comparable 
between these different sub-groups (see immunogenicity discussion). HZ VE was similar according to 
anticipated duration of post-transplant antiviral prophylaxis (≤3 months vs. >3 months to ≤6 months). 
For actual duration of post-transplant antiviral prophylaxis (i.e., none, ≤60 days, >60 days), VE was 
lower in those who received prophylaxis >60 days, but CI are very wide, and it is not clear whether this 
could reflect a true and meaningful difference. An evaluation of VE by region was also performed and 
results were consistent with the overall VE estimate. Definite conclusions on subgroups cannot be drawn 
given the small numbers, but no concern was raised. No subgroup analysis of patients under ongoing IS 
therapies, and no exploratory stratified analyses according to type of IS therapy was provided. 
Pain duration was reduced in vaccinated vs. Placebo confirmed HZ cases (median [min.-max.] duration of 
severe ‘worst’ HZ-associated pain was 14.0 (1.0-178.0) days in the HZ/su group and 24.0 (1.0-1025.0) 
days in the Placebo group). In the HZ/su group less subjects with a confirmed HZ episode used 3 or more 
pain medications compared to the placebo group (10.2% vs. 27.4%). In addition, the duration of pain 
medication was shorter in the HZ/su group (median 21.5 days [min – max: 1.0 –436.0]) compared with 
the Placebo group (median 47.5 days [min - max 1.0 – 1642.0]). 
Of the 10 subjects with PHN episode(s) in the mTVC of ZOSTER-002, 1 was in the HZ/su group and 9 in 
the Placebo group. The overall incidence of PHN per 1000 person-years was 0.5 in the HZ/su group and 
4.9 in the Placebo group, i.e. 10-fold the incidence in immunocompetent adults ≥50 YOA as incidence of 
PHN in the Placebo group was 0.6 per 1000 person-years (ZOSTER-006). 
The overall PHN VE of 89.27% (95% CI: 22.54% - 99.76%). As a reminder, in ZOSTER-006, VE against 
PHN was 100.00% (95% CI: 77.11-100.00) in the ≥50 YOA. In subjects with a confirmed HZ episode in 
the mTVC, PHN was reported in 1 out of 49 subjects of the HZ/su group and 9 out of 135 subjects of the 
Placebo group leading to a VE of 69.39% (95% CI: -77.38% - 94.97%) in reduction of PHN incidence in 
subjects with a confirmed HZ episode.  
HZ complications were considered as AEs or SAEs, but only HZ complications associated with confirmed 
HZ were included for analysis of the applicable secondary endpoint. In case of suspected HZ diagnosed 
without characteristic HZ or VZV rash, the HZAC classification served as the final case confirmation. In 
ZOSTER-002, there was no confirmed HZ case without a typical rash, which may be surprising given the 
increasingly acknowledged entity ZSH and the importance of atypical presentation in IC patients. 
Reported HZ complications related to confirmed HZ (other than PHN) were HZ meningoencephalitis (1 
subject in the Placebo group) and HZ cutaneous disseminated (3 subjects in the HZ/su group and 12 
subjects in the Placebo group). In the mTVC, HZ/su efficacy was also demonstrated against HZ related 
complications, with an overall VE of 77.76% (95% CI: 19.05% - 95.93%). A high frequency of 
complications is commonly reported in IC patients. In the literature, the most frequently reported 
complications in IC patients are PHN and disseminated HZ (cutaneous or visceral involvement). However, 
there is limited data on actual incidence of HZ-related complications in IC populations. The MAH provided 
incidence data from a systematic literature review available for 34 studies, which also included  ZOSTER-

002 and ZOSTER-039 studies [McKay, 2019] (Table 4). The frequency of HZ-related complications in the 
Placebo groups of ZOSTER-002 and ZOSTER-039 is in line with that reported in the literature.  
Table 73: Proportion of subjects with HZ-related complications in ZOSTER-002 and ZOSTER-
039 versus literature 
There was no death related to HZ in this study, and overall mortality was similar in both groups. In the 
mTVC, HZ-related hospitalization was observed in 2 subjects of the HZ/su group and 13 subjects of the 
Placebo group. The VE against first or only episode of confirmed HZ-related hospitalizations was 84.70% 
(95% CI: 32.15% - 96.55%) during the entire study period. 
ZOSTER-039: 
In ZOSTER-039, 562 subjects constitute the TVC (283 in the HZ/su group and 279 in the Placebo group). 
Of the HZ/su group and the Placebo group, 16.6% and 22.6% subjects did not complete the trial. The 
attrition rate and the causes of attrition were balanced across groups. Respectively 259 and 256 subjects 
were included in the HZ/su and Placebo groups of the mTVC constituted for the post-hoc efficacy analysis. 
Demographic characteristics were well balanced across groups. The mean age of participants at first 
vaccination was 57.3 years. The most represented underlying diseases were multiple myeloma 
(respectively 23.7% vs. 23.3% in the HZ/su and Placebo group), followed by Hodgkin lymphoma (17.3% 
vs. 16.8%), Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (14.8% vs. 14.7%), Non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma (14.5% 
vs. 14.0%), Non-Hodgkin T cell lymphoma (4.6% vs. 5.7%), and other Haematologic Malignancies 
(25.1% vs. 25.7%). Physical performance status of the subjects (definition from the Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group) was also well balanced across groups. Most subjects were fully active (respectively 
63.7% and 64.3% in the HZ/su and Placebo group). The vaccine was administered after the full cancer 
treatment course (from 10 days to 6 months post therapy) for respectively 64.0% and 62.0% of the 
subjects in the HZ/su and Placebo groups. For the other patients it was administered during the cancer 
treatment (with at least 10 days between cycles and each vaccination). The following subclasses of IS 
cancer therapy were the most frequently administered (i.e. by >20% of subjects in the HZ/su group), at 
least one day from 1 year prior to Dose 1 up to blood sample 1 month post Dose 2: nitrogen and mustard 
analogues, anthracyclines, antimitotic agents including antimicrotubule agents, and pyrimidine analogues. 
Immunotherapeutic agents specifically targeting B-cells (rituximab or a rituximab-containing regimen) 
were given to most subjects with NHBCL and CLL within the interval between 6 months prior to 
vaccination and 1-month post Dose 2. Only few subjects with other underlying diseases received such 
therapy.  
Respectively 28 (9.9%) and 26 (9.3%) patients in the HZ/su group and the Placebo group had undergone 
autologous HSCT before vaccination. In addition, 19 (6.7%) and 21 (7.5%) patients in the HZ/su group 
and the Placebo group had undergone allogeneic HSCT before vaccination. No subgroup analysis of 
patients under ongoing IS therapies, and no exploratory stratified analyses according to type of IS 
therapy was provided.

Overall, the groups are balanced for the presented characteristics. Nevertheless, residual counfounding 
cannot be ruled out. 
The incidence rate of confirmed HZ cases was 20.24 per 1000 person-years in the HZ/su group (6 cases 
out of 283 subjects) and 70.87 per 1000 person-years in the Placebo group (19 cases out of 279 
subjects) (TVC). In a post-hoc analysis of ZOSTER-039, VE was 87.2% (95% CI: 44.25–98.59) over a 
median follow-up time of 11 months. This analysis is based on 2 and 14 subjects with confirmed HZ 
episodes in the mTVC, respectively in the HZ/su group and in the Placebo group.  
Findings of this post hoc analysis in patients with hematologic tumours are consistent with the findings of 
ZOSTER-002. However, as discussed for ZOSTER-002, it is unclear whether efficacy can be extrapolated 
to all IC patients, in particular those who are under ongoing IS therapy or receive IS therapy after 
vaccination. In ZOSTER-039, HZ/su was administered after the full cancer treatment course (from 10 
days to 6 months post therapy) for most patients (respectively 64.0% and 62.0% of the subjects in the 
HZ/su and Placebo groups), the remaining patients received HZ/su during the course of therapy. There 
was a marked difference in incidence rate in favour of HZ/su compared to placebo, whether the vaccine 
was administered during or after the immunosuppressive cancer therapy course. This a reassuring 
finding. However, definite conclusion are difficult to draw given the small number of cases. Additionally, 
differences in immunogenicity data were observed when the vaccine was administrated during or after 
the IS cancer therapy course. Vaccine immunogenicity also varied according to the underlying disease 
(which may be due to the type of therapy they receive). Moreover, VE might also varies according to 
other factors such as previous therapies (duration and cycles) that may affect the capacity of the cells to 
elicit an optimal immune responses.  
In the HZ/su group (TVC), 3 subjects experienced HZ complications associated with a confirmed HZ 
episode (1 subject with disseminated HZ and PHN, and 2 other subjects with PHN). In the Placebo group 
(TVC), 4 subjects experienced HZ complications associated with a confirmed HZ episode (2 subjects had a 
severe HZ requiring hospitalisation all 4 subjects had one episode of PHN).  
Factors that could influence protective immunity: 
In general, it was considered useful for all studies to have a more in-depth insight in the nature of the 
study populations, in order to understand how far it is representative of other IC populations. The factors 
that could influence vaccine efficacy and immunogenicity are age, underlying disease, timing of 
vaccination in relation to transplantation and in relation to IS therapy, as well as the type and duration of 
IS therapy used by subjects before, during and after vaccination. The MAH was invited to provide any 
relevant data useful to understand the populations in that respect. The MAH provided limited additional 
data, and did not include new data for ZOSTER-002, as would have been expected.  
The available data do not suggest that age importantly affects vaccine efficacy and immunogenicity in IC 
individuals. The data do not allow to conclude on the impact of underlying disease ‘per se’ on the immune 
responses and efficacy. There is an indirect evidence that patients under anti-CD20 antibodies present 
much lower humoral responses (see immunogenicity assessment). Lower humoral immune responses 
were observed when Shingrix was administered during versus before or after IS cancer therapy. The 
clinical relevance in terms of impact on efficacy, on the short and long term, is unknown. In both 
ZOSTER-002 and ZOSTER-039 (the studies which generated the efficacy data), subjects received IS 
therapies up to a few weeks before the vaccination course, but most subjects did not receive therapies 
during or shortly after the vaccination course. This also concurs to the conclusion that vaccine efficacy in 
subjects under concomitant IS therapy is not known. The SmPC reflects that studies were not designed to 
assess the impact of specific immunosuppressive treatments on vaccine efficacy. The SmPC also reflects 
that most vaccine recipients were not under IS therapy at the time of vaccination. Correlate of protection:

CoP assessment was performed in study ZOSTER-039. Given the very limited number of confirmed HZ 
cases included in the analysis (2 in the HZ/su group and 12 in the Placebo group), no conclusion can be 
drawn. Detailed on planned analyses were not presented. 
An attempt to identify a CoP was already done with anti-gE Ab data of ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 
studies at initial MAA. The methods and results were extensively discussed at that time and are 
summarized in the EPAR. Because of the many uncertainties and limitations that were remaining, it was 
concluded that the CoP is not sufficiently understood and validated to be considered as an established 
general CoP. It was however agreed that post-dose 2 anti-gE can be used as an immune marker for 
immunobridging in immunocompetent individuals ≥50 years of age and that in certain circumstances is 
possible based on anti-gE non-inferiority. 
Based on the available efficacy and immunogenicity data, it appears that the exercise to identify a CoP for 
IC populations might be even more challenging. Because of the altered immune system that characterize 
IC subjects, and in contrast to immunocompetent subjects, circulating Ab titers might not be a good 
marker to evaluate the protective response in IC patients. The quality of the humoral immune response 
might be different than for immunocompetent people. This also applies to CMI. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Shingrix administered according to a 2-dose schedule with an interval of 1-2 months between doses 
clearly demonstrated an efficacy in protecting adult autologous HCT patients against HZ, when vaccinated 
only 5-7 weeks after the transplant (68.17% [95% CI: 55.56% - 77.53%] over 21 months, ZOSTER-
002). A similar level of efficacy was found in a post-hoc analysis performed in ZOSTER-039, which 
enrolled patients with haematological malignancies during or after the chemotherapy course (VE was 
87.2% [95%CI: 44.25–98.59] over a median follow-up time of 11 months). Shingrix also reduced the 
incidence of PHN (VE of 89.27% [95% CI: 22.54% - 99.76%] in ZOSTER-002) and other HZ related 
complications, and the severity and duration of pain.  
Both studies brought the proof that Shingrix is able to protect IC patients from HZ and to reduce the 
burden and severity related to HZ in them. Efficacy was lower compared to that found in 
immunocompetent individuals 50 YOA and over (97% for HZ). 
There is no established CoP for Shingrix, and the level of efficacy can therefore not be derived from the 
immunogenicity data generated in the other IC populations (patients with solid malignancies vaccinated 
just before or during chemotherapy and patients who had undergone a solid organ transplant). Since VE 
was not evaluated in all immunosuppressed populations, different levels of VE in each population cannot 
be ruled out. Nonetheless, since immunogenicity, both humoral and cellular, was clearly demonstrated in 
all studied populations, an acceptable efficacy level (together with an absent of safety signals and an 
acceptable reactogenicity) can be assumed. 
Altogether it is considered likely that Shingrix provides a benefit in IC adult patients. However, 
uncertainties remain as to the level of efficacy, particularly in patients under ongoing (certain types) of IS 
therapies. Uncertainties also remain about whether the efficacy is sustained over time. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
•  Safety profile in the existing indication

In the clinical studies included in the main and broader safety pooling analyses submitted for initial 
licensure, a total of 14,645 (ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 pivotal trials) and 15,493 (ZOSTER-006 and 
ZOSTER-022 pivotal trials and additional supportive studies) older adults ≥50 YOA have been vaccinated 
with at least one dose of HZ/su, respectively. Reactogenicity, both local and general was frequent, 
including for high grade events. In the overall population ≥50 YOA (ZOSTER-006), 79.1% of subjects 
experienced pain at the site of administration, and 6.7% experienced grade 3 pain. At least one solicited 
general symptom was reported for 66.1% of subjects, and at least one grade 3 solicited general symptom 
for 11.4% of subjects. The most frequently reported solicited general symptoms were myalgia (46.3% 
per subject) and fatigue (45.9% per subject). Fever (≥37.5°C) was reported in 21.5% of the subjects. In 
general, local and general symptoms lasted for a few days (median duration was 3 days for pain, days for 
myalgia and fatigue, 1 day for fever).  
Within the ≥50 YOA immunocompetent population of ZOSTER-006, reactogenicity clearly increased with 
decreasing age. In the age categories 50-59 YOA, 60-69 YOA, and ≥70 YOA respectively, solicited local 
symptoms were reported by 89.6%, 84.6%, and 73.2% of subjects and solicited general symptoms were 
reported by 76.7%, 68.7%, 56.4% of subjects. Results for the subjects ≥70 YOA are in line in ZOSTER-
006 and ZOSTER-022. Only limited safety data from the early development phase of HZ/su are available 
for immunocompetent subjects 18-49 YOA. The SCS submitted at MAA presents safety data from adults 
18-30 YOA enrolled in EXPLO-CRD-004 and ZOSTER-023. Although on a small sample size (10 subjects 
per study), these data point to a higher reactogenicity in these 18-30 YOA individuals compared to ≥50 
YOA individuals. Pain occurred in all subjects, and grade 3 pain respectively in 1/10 and 3/10 in EXPLO-
CRD-004 and ZOSTER-023 respectively. Fatigue occurred in nearly all subjects (9/10 and 10/10 
respectively), and grade 3 fatigue in 0/10 and 4/10 subjects respectively. Myalgia occurred in most 
subjects (7/10 and 10/10), and grade 3 myalgia in 0/10 and 3/10 subjects. Fever occurred in 3/10 and 
7/10 subjects respectively. 
Based on the data submitted at MAA, there was no identified risk. The following potential risks were 
listed: (i) Virus reactivation in immunocompetent individuals with a history of Herpes Zoster, (ii) Risk of 
potential Immune Mediated Disorders (pIMDs) following Shingrix vaccination. In addition, the Use of 
Shingrix in adults with pre-existing pIMD was considered as a missing information. 
In pre-licensure clinical trials, which are not designed to assess rare outcomes, numerical differences 
between Shingrix and Placebo groups were noted for certain conditions, including: polymyalgia 
rheumatica (PMR), giant cell arteritis (GCA), Ischemic optic neuropathy (ION), Supraventricular 
tachycardia (SVT), and gout. After licensure, using an algorithm that preferentially maximizes sensitivity 
over specificity, the U.S. Vaccine Safety Datalink detected a statistical signal for Guillain-Barré syndrome 
(GBS) during active surveillance for Shingrix safety.  
Two PASS are ongoing to evaluate the to evaluate the safety of Shingrix in adults ≥50 years of age in the 
United States: EPI-ZOSTER-030/032. 
•  Summary of the methodology used 
This report describes the safety and reactogenicity results from the 6 clinical studies (4 pivotal studies [3 
Phase III studies and 1 Phase II/III study] and 2 supportive Phase I/II studies) that support the HZ/su 
application in adults ≥18 YOA at increased risk of HZ. The methods used to evaluate safety and 
reactogenicity in the 6 studies were largely identical.  
Safety endpoints: 
In addition to Adverse Event (AE), Serious Adverse Event (SAE) and Medically Attended Adverse Event 
(MAE), the following safety endpoints were assessed: suspected herpes zoster and herpes zoster 
complications, potentially immune-mediated diseases (pIMD) and new onset autoimmune diseases 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 116/173 
 
 
  
  
 
(NOAD), relapse cases (ZOSTER-002 and ZOSTER-001, recurrence of the underlying malignancy or 
disease for which the HSCT was undertaken), disease progression (ZOSTER-002), disease-related events 
(DRE, ZOSTER-039, included cases of relapse and occurrences of disease progression), biopsy-proven 
renal allograft rejections (ZOSTER-041), hematological and biochemical parameters measured at baseline 
and at pre-defined timepoints post vaccination (ZOSTER-001 and ZOSTER-015). 
Standard definitions were used for Adverse Event (AE), Serious Adverse Event (SAE) and Medically 
Attended Adverse Event (MAE). 
-  Suspected herpes zoster and herpes zoster complications 
The definition of suspected HZ, confirmed HZ, and complications of HZ used in ZOSTER-002 and ZOSTER-
039 is described in the efficacy section of this report. 
In ZOSTER-028, ZOSTER-039, and ZOSTER-041, the occurrence of suspected HZ and/or HZ 
complications constituted an AE or SAE, as appropriate.  
In ZOSTER-039 and ZOSTER-002, the occurrence of HZ with characteristic VZV or HZ rash was recorded 
in HZ-specific electronic case report form (eCRF) screens.  
In ZOSTER-002, cases of HZ without characteristic VZV or HZ rash were considered as an SAE and were 
specified on the SAE screen as related to HZ. 
In ZOSTER-001 and ZOSTER-015, suspected cases of HZ were defined as a new unilateral rash 
accompanied by pain (broadly defined to include allodynia, pruritus, or other sensations) and no 
alternative diagnosis. Suspected HZ cases were collected throughout the study period and confirmed by 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or by a GSK expert. These cases were collected as endpoints for 
descriptive and exploratory evaluations. 
In all studies, HZ complications, including but not limited to PHN (see above for ZOSTER-002), HZ 
vasculitis, disseminated disease, ophthalmic disease, neurologic disease, and visceral disease, were 
recorded by the investigator and considered as AEs or SAEs as appropriate. 
-  Adverse events of special interest, including potentially immune-mediated diseases and new onset 
autoimmune diseases 
In the pivotal studies, pIMDs were considered a subset of AEs that included autoimmune diseases and 
other inflammatory and/or neurological disorders of interest which may or may not have an autoimmune 
etiology. The method of collecting events of possible autoimmune etiology has evolved over time, from 
the former approach for the collection of NOADs and other immune-mediated inflammatory disorders (in 
ZOSTER-001 and ZOSTER-015 for this submission) to the current method of collecting pIMDs, which 
includes relevant events previously classified as NOADs and other immune-mediated inflammatory 
disorders. An ‘immune-mediated’ concept is used rather than ‘autoimmune’ as in some of these diseases, 
a true autoantibody-dependent pathophysiology has been argued/debated. The term ‘potential’ refers to 
the pathogenic etiology of the disease as ‘potentially’, representing an autoimmune or immune-mediated 
inflammatory process. 
A pre-defined list is used across clinical development programs with vaccines using a combination of 
adjuvants or Adjuvant Systems. This list is regularly updated based on evolving scientific information on 
pIMDs and changes are applicable to new protocols developed after the update. As of 30 June 2017, after 
the completion of all studies included in this submission, GSK’s pre-defined list of pIMDs was updated 
with the inclusion of ‘gout’ as a musculoskeletal disorder that could represent an immune-mediated 
inflammatory process of interest. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 117/173 
 
 
  
  
 
A list of corresponding terms for each of the diseases included in the most recent pre-defined list of 
pIMDs is linked to the MedDRA (i.e., using a customized query for pIMDs, GSKMQ_pIMD), to facilitate 
database encoding and to perform targeted searches for signal detection, safety monitoring, and 
analyses. This customized query is updated twice a year with each MedDRA versioning. 
A disease-specific questionnaire for each disease in the pIMDs list is provided to investigators as general 
guidance and relevant information to obtain a clinical description in sufficient detail.  
The investigator was asked to exercise his/her medical and scientific judgement in deciding whether 
diseases not included in the protocol-specified list had an autoimmune origin (i.e., pathophysiology 
involving systemic or organ-specific pathogenic autoantibodies) and to report those as pIMDs. 
Assessment of intensity: 
Pain at the injection site was scored as follows: grade 1: any pain neither interfering with nor preventing 
normal every day activities; grade 2: painful when limb is moved and interfered with everyday activities; 
grade 3: significant pain at rest that prevented normal every day activities. 
The maximum intensity of local injection site redness/swelling (greatest surface diameter) was scored 
using GSK’s standard grading scale based on the FDA guidelines for Toxicity Grading Scale for Healthy 
Adult and Adolescent Volunteers enrolled in Preventive Vaccine Clinical Trials (FDA, 2007): 0 : <20 mm 
diameter; 1 : ≥20 mm to ≤50 mm diameter; 2 : >50 mm to ≤100 mm diameter; 3 : >100 mm 
diameter. 
Temperature (measured by oral, axillary, or tympanic route) was scored as follows: 0 : <37.5°C; 1 : 
37.5°C to 38.0°C ; 2 : 38.1°C to 39.0°C; 3 : >39.0°C (>39.5°C in ZOSTER-002). The preferred 
route for recording temperature was oral. 
The intensity of solicited general symptoms (except fever) was scored as follows: grade 1: symptom that 
was easily tolerated; grade 2: symptom that interfered with normal activity; grade 3: symptom that 
prevented normal activity. 
The investigator assessed the maximum intensity that occurred over the duration of the event for 
unsolicited AEs (including serious and non-serious AEs) recorded during the study. The assessment was 
based on the investigator’s clinical judgment. The intensity was assigned to 1 of the following categories: 
Grade 1 (mild) was an AE which was easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and not 
interfering with or preventing everyday activities; Grade 2 (moderate) was an AE which was sufficiently 
discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities; Grade 3 (severe) was an AE which prevented 
normal everyday activities. 
Assessment of causality 
The investigator had to assess the relationship between the administered vaccine and the occurrence of 
each AE/SAE using clinical judgment, considering alternative plausible  causes, and by consulting the 
Investigator Brochure to determine his/her assessment. All solicited local (injection site) reactions were 
considered causally related to vaccination. 
Reporting periods: 
The reporting periods For the safety endpoints, as defined per protocol are displayed in Table 74 for the 
pivotal studies and Table 75 for ZOSTER-001 and ZOSTER-015. In all studies except ZOSTER-002, the 
study duration lasted until 12 months post last vaccination. In ZOSTER-002, the study duration was 
longer, since follow-up was driven by HZ case accrual and ranged from a minimum of 12 months post last 
vaccination to 4 years at subject level (actual median safety follow-up time 29 months).

Statistical methods: 
In all studies, the primary analysis for safety was based on the Total Vaccinated Cohort (TVC), which 
included all subjects with at least 1 vaccine administration documented.  
Descriptive analysis of the pre-defined safety endpoints was performed. overall and by age range (18-49 
YOA and ≥50 YOA strata) for the 6 studies. In order to align the analysis time points between studies, an 
analysis cut-off of 365 days post last vaccination was chosen for ZOSTER-002. 
Additionally, for each pivotal study separately, the percentage of subjects reporting the occurrence of 
other events of medical interest, classified by MedDRA Primary SOC and PT as AE (within the 30-day 
post-vaccination period) or SAE (within the 365-day post-vaccination period for all pivotal studies) was 
tabulated (post-hoc analysis after study completion). These events were selected based on the most 
frequently reported events observed in the IC clinical studies, medically relevant events for the specific 
population, or previous feedback from regulatory authorities during the initial file application (Table 76). 
This analysis was not pre-specified in the study protocols and was done in preparation for the current 
submission. The search strategy of the individual clinical study databases used standard customized 
MedDRA queries that contained a pre-defined list of PTs for each event of interest.

Patient exposure 
In all 6 studies, a total of 1,587 subjects received at least 1 dose of HZ/su (443 subjects in the 18-49 
YOA stratum and 1,144 in the ≥50 YOA stratum). 
In the 4 pivotal studies, in which a 2-dose vaccination schedule was followed, the compliance with the 2-
dose schedule was high, ranging from 85.5% to 95.5% in the HZ/su groups. By age stratum in all 
studies, the compliance was comparable between the 18-49 YOA and ≥50 YOA strata (Table 77). 
Table 77: Pivotal studies: Summary of the number and percentage of subjects ≥18 YOA who 
received vaccine dose(s) by age strata (Total Vaccinated Cohort)  
Demographic and Other Characteristics of Study Population: 
For subjects receiving HZ/su (gE/AS01B), the mean age at first vaccination ranged between 46.6 and 
57.8 YOA across studies. In the HZ/su group of most studies, more male than female subjects were 
enrolled (range: 59.7%-93.2%), except for ZOSTER-028 (40.2% was male), and most subjects were of 
White - Caucasian/European heritage (range: 66.7%-96.8%). The demographic profile of subjects in the 
HZ/su and the Placebo group within each study was comparable with respect to mean age, gender, 
ethnicity, and geographic ancestry.  
In all studies, the demographic characteristics were generally balanced between the 18-49 YOA and ≥50 
YOA strata. However, in ZOSTER-028, the male:female balance was 9.7%:90.3% in the 18-49 YOA (while 
51.2%:48.8% in the ≥50 YOA stratum). The higher proportion of females in the 18-49 YOA stratum 
relates to the incidence of the malignancies by gender (mainly breast cancer). 
In ZOSTER-002, the reported underlying diseases included MM, NHBCL, Hodgkin lymphoma, NHTCL, AML, 
solid organ malignancies, and autoimmune diseases. MM was the most common disease in 53% of 
subjects. In the HZ/su group in ZOSTER-028, the most frequently reported solid tumor diagnoses were 
breast (45.3%) and colorectal (21.4%) tumors. The performance status (ECOG) of the majority of 
subjects (83.3%) was ‘fully active’. In the HZ/su group in ZOSTER-039, the reported hematological 
malignancies included MM (23.7%), Hodgkin lymphoma (17.3%), CLL (14.8%), NHBCL (14.5%), NHTCL 
(4.6%), and other hematological malignancies (25.1%). The ECOG performance status was ‘fully active’ 
for 63.7% of subjects and ‘restricted in physically strenuous activity’ in 33.8% of subjects.

Adverse events 
Below results are presented for the pivotal trials. When comparing incidences between study groups or 
age strata, the term ‘within the same range’ is used when the 95% CIs of the incidences overlap. 
Incidences were considered ‘higher’ or ‘lower’ in one group or the other based on non-overlapping 95% 
CIs. 
•  Solicited symptoms overall 
In all pivotal studies, the overall incidence of solicited local symptoms (any grade) during the 7-day post-
vaccination period was higher in the HZ/su group than in the Placebo group. In the HZ/su groups, the 
overall/subject incidence of solicited local symptoms was within the same range across the pivotal 
studies. In all pivotal studies, the overall/dose incidence of solicited general symptoms (any grade) during 
the 7-day post-vaccination period was higher in the HZ/su group than in the Placebo group. In ZOSTER-
002 and ZOSTER-039, the overall/subject incidence was also higher in the HZ/su group than in the 
Placebo group, while it was within the same range in ZOSTER-028 and ZOSTER-041. In the HZ/su 
groups, the overall/subject incidence of solicited general symptoms was within the same range across the 
pivotal studies (Table 78).

In all pivotal studies, the overall incidence of grade 3 solicited local symptoms was higher in the HZ/su 
group than in the Placebo group. In the HZ/su groups, the overall/subject incidence of grade 3 solicited 
local symptoms was within the same range across the pivotal studies. In ZOSTER-002 and ZOSTER-039, 
the overall incidence of grade 3 solicited general symptoms was higher in the HZ/su group than in the 
respective Placebo groups, while in ZOSTER-028 and ZOSTER-041, the incidence in the HZ/su and 
Placebo group was within the same range. In the HZ/su groups, the overall/subject incidence of grade 3 
solicited general symptoms was within the same range across the pivotal studies (Table 79).

Vaccinated Cohort)  
Solicited local symptoms 
For the pivotal studies, the overall incidence of each solicited local symptom is presented in Table 80. 
- After receiving HZ/su, the most frequently reported solicited local symptom was pain (overall/subject 
range: 79.5%-87.0%; overall/dose range: 64.3%-78.1%), followed by redness (overall/subject range: 
25.2%-41.4%; overall/dose range: 17.6%-30.4%), and swelling (overall/subject range: 11.5%-22.7%; 
overall/dose range: 8.2%-16.7%). 
- The incidence of each solicited local symptom was lower in the Placebo group than in the HZ/su group in 
all pivotal studies. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 124/173 
 
 
  
  
 
 
- Pain was also the most frequently reported grade 3 solicited local symptom (overall/subject range: 
9.8%-11.0%; overall/dose range: 5.7%-7.4%). In the Placebo groups, grade 3 pain was only reported in 
ZOSTER-002 (overall/subject: 0.3%; overall/dose: 0.2%). 
Table 80: Pivotal studies: Overall incidence of solicited local symptoms reported during the 7-
day (Days 0-6) post-vaccination period (Total Vaccinated Cohort)  
Across the pivotal studies, in the HZ/su groups, the median duration of solicited local symptoms during 
the 7-day post-vaccination period was at most 3.0 days, except for redness and swelling in both ZOSTER-
028 and ZOSTER-041 (4.0 days). In the Placebo group of all pivotal studies, the median duration of the 
majority of solicited local symptoms was at most 2.0 days.

In both the 18-49 YOA and ≥50 YOA age strata in all pivotal studies, the median duration of the majority 
of solicited local symptoms was at most 3.0 days in the HZ/su groups and at most 2.0 days in the Placebo 
groups. In the HZ/su group of all pivotal studies, no apparent differences were observed between both 
age strata in the median duration of all solicited local symptoms.  
Solicited general symptoms 
For the pivotal studies, the overall incidence of each solicited general symptom is presented in Table 86. 
- In all pivotal studies, after receiving HZ/su, the most frequently reported solicited general symptoms 
were fatigue (overall/subject range: 47.3%-69.6%; overall/dose range: 37.5%-54.1%) and myalgia 
(overall/subject range: 43.9%-53.7%; overall/dose range: 32.5%-41.2%). Fatigue and myalgia were 
reported more frequently in the HZ/su group than in the Placebo group in all pivotal studies, except for 
fatigue in ZOSTER-028 and ZOSTER-041 where the incidence was within the same range in the treatment 
groups. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 129/173 
 
 
  
  
 
 
- In ZOSTER-002 and ZOSTER-039, the incidence of each solicited general symptom was higher in the 
HZ/su group than in the Placebo group. In all pivotal studies, the incidence of myalgia and fever was 
higher in the HZ/su group than in the Placebo group. 
- In all pivotal studies, after receiving HZ/su, the most frequently reported grade 3 solicited general 
symptoms were fatigue (overall/subject range: 3.1%-14.3%; overall/dose range: 2.7%-9.1%) and 
myalgia (overall/subject range: 6.2%-10.7%; overall/dose range: 3.7%-5.7%). In all pivotal studies, the 
incidence of grade 3 fatigue was within the same range in the HZ/su and Placebo groups, except for 
ZOSTER-002, where the incidence in the HZ/su group was higher. In ZOSTER-028 and ZOSTER-041, the 
incidence of grade 3 myalgia was within the same range in the HZ/su and Placebo groups, while in 
ZOSTER-002 and ZOSTER-039, the incidences in the HZ/su groups were higher than in the respective 
Placebo groups. 
- In all pivotal studies, after receiving HZ/su, the most frequently reported solicited general symptoms 
assessed by the investigator as causally related to vaccination were also fatigue (overall/subject range: 
11.5%-23.3%; overall/dose range: 6.3%-16.1%) and myalgia (overall/subject range: 16.0%-31.0%; 
overall/dose range: 9.8%-21.8%). 
Across the pivotal studies, in the HZ/su groups, the median duration of solicited general symptoms during 
the 7-day post-vaccination period was at most 3.0 days, except for fatigue and gastrointestinal symptoms 
in ZOSTER-028 (both 4.0 days). In the Placebo group of all pivotal studies, the median duration was at 
most 5.0 days.

In the HZ/su group of ZOSTER-028, ZOSTER-039, and ZOSTER-041, the incidence of the majority of 
solicited general symptoms (any grade, grade 3, related, and grade 3 related) was within the same range 
in the 18-49 YOA and ≥50 YOA strata.  
In ZOSTER-039, myalgia (any grade) and related myalgia were reported with higher incidences in the 18-
49 YOA stratum. In ZOSTER-002, grade 3 fatigue, headache (any grade), fever (any grade), and related 
fever were reported with higher incidences in the 18-49 YOA stratum. 
In the Placebo group of all pivotal studies, the incidence of the majority of solicited general symptoms 
was within the same range in both age strata.

In the HZ/su group of all pivotal studies, no apparent differences were observed between both age strata 
in the median duration of all solicited general symptoms. 
•  Analysis of adverse events by System Organ Class and Preferred Term 
All unsolicited (serious and non-serious) adverse events: 
In each pivotal study, the percentage of subjects reporting the occurrence of at least 1 unsolicited AE 
within the 30-day post-vaccination period was within the same range in the HZ/su and Placebo group. In 
ZOSTER-028, the overall incidence of unsolicited AEs in both the HZ/su and the Placebo group was higher 
(85.5% in the HZ/su group and 89.6% in the Placebo group) than in the other studies (39.0% and 38.2% 
in ZOSTER-002, 47.3% and 45.9% in ZOSTER-039, and 38.6% and 33.3% in ZOSTER-041). The events 
were generally consistent with the underlying diseases, complications, and therapies of the study 
subjects, except for events associated with reactogenicity, which were mostly under the SOC of General 
disorders and administration site conditions.

In what follows, for each pivotal study a summarizing description of AEs is provided, which presents the 
PTs that were reported in ≥3.0% of subjects in any of the groups. As the overall incidence of AEs was 
higher in ZOSTER-028 than in the other studies, a higher cut-off (i.e., ≥13.0%) was chosen for this study. 
The source is an exhaustive table of PTs in Appendix Tables 40, 41, 42, and 43. 
In ZOSTER-002, the most frequently reported SOCs in both groups were Infections and infestations, 
General disorders and administration site conditions, Gastrointestinal disorders, Skin and subcutaneous 
tissue disorders, and Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders. By PT, events reported in ≥3.0% of 
subjects in any of the groups included upper respiratory tract infection (reported in 28 subjects [3.0%] in 
the HZ/su group and 30 [3.2%] in the Placebo group) and viral upper respiratory tract infection (23 
[2.5%] and 30 [3.2%], respectively). By PT, none of the unsolicited AEs were reported with significantly 
higher incidence in any of the groups. 
In ZOSTER-028, the most frequently reported SOCs in both groups were Gastrointestinal disorders, 
General disorders and administration site conditions, Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, Blood and 
lymphatic system disorders, and Nervous system disorders. By PT, events reported in ≥13.0% of subjects 
in any of the groups included nausea (reported in 31 subjects [26.5%] in the HZ/su group and 28 
[24.3%] in the Placebo group), asthenia (30 [25.6%] and 28 [24.3%], respectively), alopecia (21 
[17.9%] and 23 [20.0%], respectively), constipation (16 [13.7%] and 12 [10.4%], respectively), and 
neutropenia (11 [9.4%] and 15 [13.0%], respectively. By PT, none of the unsolicited AEs were reported 
with significantly higher incidence in any of the groups. 
In ZOSTER-039, the most frequently reported SOCs were Infections and infestations, Gastrointestinal 
disorders, General disorders and administration site conditions, Musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders, and Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders. The SOC of Neoplasms benign, 
malignant, and unspecified (including cysts and polyps), with an RR of 0.27 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.68; p-
value: 0.0033) was reported with significantly higher incidence in the Placebo group than in the HZ/su 
group. By PT, events reported in ≥3.0% of subjects in any of the groups included nausea (reported in 11 
subjects [3.9%] in the HZ/su group and 6 [2.2%] in the Placebo group), pyrexia (10 [3.5%] and 5 
[1.8%], respectively), oropharyngeal pain (10 [3.5%] and 3 [1.1%], respectively), diarrhea (9 [3.2%] 
and 5 [1.8%], respectively), upper respiratory tract infection (9 [3.2%] and 1 [0.4%], respectively), 
cough (9 [3.2%] and 10 [3.6%], respectively), and nasopharyngitis (7 [2.5%] and 9 [3.2%], 
respectively). The PT of upper respiratory tract infection, with an RR of 8.87 (95% CI: 1.23, 388.9; p-
value: 0.0228), was reported with significantly higher incidence in the HZ/su group than in the Placebo 
group and the PT of acute myeloid leukemia, with an RR of 0.12 (95% CI: 0.00, 0.92; p-value: 0.0371) 
was reported with significantly higher incidence in the Placebo group. 
In ZOSTER-041, the most frequently reported SOCs were Infections and infestations, Gastrointestinal 
disorders, General disorders and administration site conditions, Musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders, and Respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders. By PT, events reported in ≥3.0% of 
subjects in any of the groups included urinary tract infection (reported in 6 subjects [4.5%] in the HZ/su 
group and 3 [2.3%] in the Placebo group) and nasopharyngitis (3 [2.3%] and 5 [3.8%], respectively). By 
PT, none of the AEs were reported with significantly higher incidence in any of the groups. 
By PT, the most frequently reported grade 3 unsolicited AEs (i.e., reported in ≥1.0% of subjects in any of 
the groups in any of the studies) were (Source: Appendix Tables 44, 45, 46, and 47).  
- Neutropenia in ZOSTER-002 (10 subjects [1.1%] in the HZ/su group and 4 [0.4%] in the Placebo 
group), ZOSTER-028 (3 [2.6%] in both groups), and ZOSTER-039 (none in the HZ/su group and 3 
[1.1%] in the Placebo group). 
- Febrile neutropenia in ZOSTER-028 (4 [3.4%] and 2 [1.7%], respectively) and ZOSTER-039 (4 [1.4%] 
and 1 [0.4%], respectively).

- Acute kidney injury in ZOSTER-028 (none in the HZ/su group and 2 [1.7%] in the Placebo group); 
- Acute myeloid leukemia in ZOSTER-039 (1 [0.4%] and 4 [1.4%], respectively). 
In all pivotal studies, the percentage of subjects reporting the occurrence of at least 1 unsolicited AE with 
a medically attended visit was within the same range in the HZ/su and Placebo group (Source: Appendix 
Tables 48, 49, 50, and 51).  
Incidences of unsolicited AEs by SOC and PT were within the same range in both age strata, except for 
the SOCs of Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (18-49 YOA: 4 [1.7%] [95% CI: 0.5%, 
4.4%]; ≥50 YOA: 45 [6.5%] [95% CI: 4.8%, 8.6%]) and Nervous system disorders (18-49 YOA: 1 
[0.4%] [95% CI: 0.0%, 2.4%]; ≥50 YOA: 37 [5.3%] [95% CI: 3.8%, 7.3%]) in ZOSTER-002, which were 
reported more frequently in the ≥50 YOA stratum. Across the pivotal studies, in the Placebo groups, 
incidences between the age strata were within the same range, except for the PT of alopecia in ZOSTER-
028 (18-49 YOA: 13 [43.3%] [95% CI: 25.5%, 62.6%]; ≥50 YOA: 10 [11.8%] [95% CI: 5.8%, 20.6%]). 
By SOC and PT, the incidence of grade 3 unsolicited AEs and MAEs was also within the same range in the 
HZ/su and Placebo group in all pivotal studies. 
Unsolicited adverse events considered related to vaccination 
Across the pivotal studies, the percentage of subjects reporting the occurrence of at least 1 unsolicited AE 
with causal relationship to vaccination as per investigator assessment within the 30-day post-vaccination 
period ranged between 3.4% and 8.5% in the HZ/su groups and between 1.8% and 7.8% in the Placebo 
groups. In each pivotal study, the incidence of related AEs was within the same range in both groups 
(Table 88). In both groups in all pivotal studies, related unsolicited AEs were mainly reported under the 
SOC of General disorders and administration site conditions (range in the HZ/su group: 1.5%-4.6%; 
range in the Placebo group: 0.6%-6.1%). By PT, each related unsolicited AE was reported in at most 
1.0% of subjects per study group, except for injection site pruritus, reported in 2 subjects (1.7%) in the 
HZ/su group of ZOSTER-028 and 4 (1.4%) in the HZ/su group of ZOSTER-039 (while not reported in the 
Placebo groups of these studies), and asthenia and injection site pain reported in 2 (1.7%) in the HZ/su 
group of ZOSTER-028 (none in Placebo) (Source: Appendix Tables 64, 65, 66, and 67). In all pivotal 
studies, the incidence of grade 3 related unsolicited AEs was low and within the same range in the HZ/su 
and Placebo group. No grade 3 related AEs were reported in the Placebo group of ZOSTER-028, ZOSTER-
039, and ZOSTER-041 (Source: Appendix Tables 68, 69, 70, and 71).

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
•  Serious adverse events 
Serious adverse events from first vaccination up to 30 days post last vaccination: 
Across the pivotal studies, the percentage of subjects reporting the occurrence of at least 1 SAE from first 
vaccination up to 30 days post last vaccination ranged between 4.5% and 13.7% in the HZ/su groups and 
between 3.8% and 12.2% in the Placebo groups. In each pivotal study, the incidence of SAEs was within 
the same range in both groups (Table 89).

For each pivotal study, a summarizing description is provided below, which presents the PTs that were 
reported in ≥1.0% of subjects in any of the groups (Source: Appendix Tables 80, 81, 82, and 83). 
In ZOSTER-002, the most frequently reported SOCs in both groups were Neoplasms benign, malignant, 
and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) and Infections and infestations. By PT, events reported in ≥
1.0% of subjects in any of the groups were pneumonia (reported in 12 subjects [1.3%] in the HZ/su 
group and 7 [0.8%] in the Placebo group) and plasma cell myeloma (6 [0.7%] and 9 [1.0%], 
respectively). 
In ZOSTER-028, the most frequently reported SOCs in both groups were Infections and infestations and 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders. By PT, events reported in ≥1.0% of subjects in any of the groups 
were febrile neutropenia (reported in 4 subjects [3.4%] in the HZ/su group and 2 [1.7%] in the Placebo 
group), sepsis (2 [1.7%] and none, respectively), acute kidney injury (none and 2 [1.7%], respectively), 
and anemia (none and 2 [1.7%], respectively). 
In ZOSTER-039, the most frequently reported SOCs in both groups were Infections and infestations and 
Blood and lymphatic system disorders. By PT, events reported in ≥1.0% of subjects in any of the groups 
were febrile neutropenia (reported in 7 subjects [2.5%] in the HZ/su group and 2 [0.7%] in the Placebo 
group), pneumonia (5 [1.8%] and none, respectively), acute myeloid leukemia (1 [0.4%] and 3 [1.1%], 
respectively), and plasma cell myeloma (1 [0.4%] and 3 [1.1%], respectively). 
In ZOSTER-041, the most frequently reported SOC in both groups was Infections and infestations. By PT, 
pyelonephritis acute (reported in 2 subjects [1.5%] in the HZ/su group and 1 [0.8%] in the Placebo 
group) was the only event reported in ≥1.0% of subjects in any of the groups. 
For the PTs pneumonia and febrile neutropenia (for which there was a numerical imbalance in absolute 
numbers heeling over to the HZ/su group in ZOSTER-002, ZOSTER-028, and ZOSTER-039), data are 
discussed below. 
Across the pivotal studies, 4 SAEs were considered as causally related to vaccination by the investigator 
(all reported in ZOSTER-002): (i) -Neutropenia, reported in 1 subject (0.1%) in the HZ/su group; (ii) 
Constipation, HZ, and toxic skin eruption, each reported in 1 subject (0.1%) in the Placebo group. 
Serious adverse events from first vaccination up to 12 months post last vaccination: 
Across the pivotal studies, the percentage of subjects reporting the occurrence of at least 1 SAE from first 
vaccination up to 12 months post last vaccination ranged between 19.7% and 30.8% in the HZ/su groups 
and between 25.0% and 36.5% in the Placebo groups. In each pivotal study, the incidence of SAEs was 
within the same range in both groups (Source Table 19 SCS). 
The most frequently reported SOCs in both groups in ZOSTER-002, ZOSTER-028, and ZOSTER-039 were 
Infections and infestations (range in the HZ/su group: 11.8%-14.1%; range in the Placebo group: 
11.7%-13.0%) and Neoplasms benign, malignant, and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) (range of 
6.0%-14.5% in the HZ/su group and 10.4%-11.8% in the Placebo group). In ZOSTER-041, Infections 
and infestations was the most frequently reported SOC in both groups (13.6% in the HZ/su group and 
10.6% in the Placebo group). 
The most frequently reported PTs (i.e., in ≥3.0% of subjects in any of the groups) were the following: 
-In ZOSTER-002: plasma cell myeloma (59 [6.4%] in the HZ/su group and 41 [4.4%] in the Placebo 
group) and pneumonia (42 [4.6%] and 30 [3.2%], respectively). 
-In ZOSTER-028: febrile neutropenia (5 [4.3%] and 2 [1.7%], respectively) and neutropenia (2 [1.7%] 
and 4 [3.5%], respectively). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 138/173 
 
 
  
  
-In ZOSTER-039: febrile neutropenia (14 [4.9%] and 11 [3.9%], respectively) and pneumonia (10 
[3.5%] and 10 [3.6%], respectively). 
-In ZOSTER-041: pyelonephritis acute (4 [3.0%] and 1 [0.8%], respectively), gastroenteritis (2 [1.5%] 
and 4 [3.0%], respectively), transplant rejection (2 [1.5%] and 4 [3.0]%, respectively), and HZ (none 
and 4 [3.0%], respectively). 
An exploratory group comparison was performed to investigate the RR of developing SAEs within the 365-
day post-vaccination period for both SOCs and PTs, in subjects that received HZ/su as compared to 
subjects receiving placebo. In ZOSTER-002, ZOSTER-028 and ZOSTER-041, none of the SAEs were 
reported with significantly higher incidence in any of the groups. In ZOSTER-039, the SOC of 
Gastrointestinal disorders was reported with significantly lower incidence in the HZ/su group compared to 
the Placebo group, with an RR of 0.20 (95% CI: 0.02, 0.93; p-value: 0.0363). 
SAEs considered as causally related to vaccination by the investigator from first vaccination up to 12 
months post last vaccination are presented in Table 90. In ZOSTER-028, no related SAEs were reported.

events classified by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term with causal 
relationship to vaccination, from first vaccination up to 12 months post last vaccination (Total 
Vaccinated Cohort)  
•  Fatal serious adverse events 
Fatal serious adverse events from first vaccination up to 30 days post last vaccination: 
Across the pivotal studies, the percentage of subjects with at least 1 fatal SAE from first vaccination up to 
30 days post last vaccination ranged between 0.7% and 2.6% in the HZ/su groups and between 0.0% 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

and 3.2% in the Placebo groups. In each pivotal study, the incidence of fatal SAEs was within the same 
range in both groups (Table 91). 
Table 91: Pivotal studies: Percentage of subjects reporting the occurrence of fatal serious 
adverse events classified by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred Term from

The most frequently reported SOC in both groups was Neoplasms benign, malignant, and unspecified 
(including cysts and polyps). None of the reported deaths was considered causally related to vaccination 
as per investigator assessment. 
Fatal serious adverse events from first vaccination up to 12 months post last vaccination: 
Across the pivotal studies, the percentage of subjects with at least 1 fatal SAE from first vaccination up to 
12 months post last vaccination ranged between 0.8% and 10.3% in the HZ/su groups and between 
0.8% and 13.3% in the Placebo groups. In each pivotal study, the incidence of fatal SAEs was within the 
same range in both groups. In all pivotal studies except ZOSTER-041, the most frequently reported SOCs 
in both groups were Neoplasms benign, malignant, and unspecified (including cysts and polyps) and 
Infections and infestations. None of the deaths reported in subjects participating in the study was 
considered causally related to vaccination as per investigator assessment. 
Of note, in ZOSTER-039, an event of neonatal death was reported as causally related to vaccination by 
the investigator. This event occurred in the offspring of a subject who was exposed to HZ/su 48 days 
prior to estimated pregnancy onset (pregnancy onset = last menstrual period + 14 days). The baby was 
born at 36 weeks of gestation and died 30 minutes after birth due to breathing difficulty. Obstetric 
ultrasounds during pregnancy showed normal fetal development. No additional details (Apgar score, 
length, and weight of the baby) are available and no autopsy was done. The mother was treated with 
chemotherapy (vinblastine, bleomycin, doxorubicin, dacarbazine) before pregnancy for her underlying 
malignancy. The investigator’s initial assessment was that a possible cause of the neonatal death could be 
due to chemotherapy received for the underlying lymphoma. However, since the subject received the 
second dose of HZ/su just prior to her pregnancy onset, the investigator also assessed that a causal role 
of the vaccine for this SAE could not be excluded. The MAH considered that the causal association with 
the vaccine was unlikely and the event of early neonatal death was more likely related to perinatal causes 
such as respiratory distress syndrome due to perinatal asphyxia/hypoxia or infection rather than 
medications received before the pregnancy onset. 
•  Other significant adverse events 
Adverse events leading to premature discontinuation of study vaccine and/or study: 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

In all pivotal studies, there were no apparent differences between the HZ/su and the Placebo group in the 
percentage of subjects who were withdrawn from the study or treatment up to 12 months post last 
vaccination (Table 92).  
Table 92: Pivotal studies: Adverse events leading to premature discontinuation of study 
vaccine and/or study from first vaccination up to 12 months post last vaccination (Total 
Vaccinated Cohort)  
The following (S)AEs that led to premature discontinuation of treatment (i.e., subject did not receive the 
second vaccination but remained in the study) were considered causally related to vaccination by the 
investigator. In ZOSTER-002, 1 subject in the HZ/su group experienced a non-serious pIMD of psoriasis 
aggravated on Day 12 post-Dose 1. The event was recovered/resolved 142 days later. In ZOSTER-002, 1 
subject in the Placebo group experienced a non-serious event of discoid eczema on Day 35 post-Dose 1. 
The outcome was not recovered/not resolved (status at the last follow-up before withdrawal). In ZOSTER-
028, 1 subject in the HZ/su group experienced a non-serious event of tachycardia on the day of 
vaccination with Dose 1 (Day 0). The event was recovered/resolved the same day. In ZOSTER-041, 1 
subject in the HZ/su group experienced a non-serious solicited symptom of fever on the day after the day 
of vaccination with Dose 1 (Day 1). The event was recovered/resolved 30 days later. 
The following (S)AEs that led to premature discontinuation of the study were considered as causally 
related to vaccination by the investigator. In ZOSTER-002, 1 subject in the HZ/su group experienced a 
non-serious AE of myalgia (related as per investigator) on Day 21 post-Dose 1 and a non-serious AE of 
Hodgkin’s lymphoma (unrelated as per investigator; relapse of underlying disease) on Day 56 post-Dose 
1. This subject did not receive the second vaccination due to the AE of myalgia and was withdrawn from 
the study due to the AE of Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The event of myalgia was recovered/resolved 36 days 
after onset, while the Hodgkin’s lymphoma was not recovered/not resolved (status at the last follow-up 
before withdrawal). In ZOSTER-002, 1 subject in the HZ/su group was withdrawn from the study due to a 
non-serious event of neutropenia on Day 32 post-Dose 1, which was not recovered/not resolved (status 
at the last follow-up before withdrawal). In ZOSTER-002, 1 subject in the Placebo group was withdrawn 
from the study due to a serious event of generalized toxic skin exanthema on the day of vaccination with 
Dose 1 (Day 0), which was recovered/resolved 7 days later. 
Potentially immune-mediated diseases: 
Potentially immune-mediated diseases from first vaccination up to 30 days post last vaccination: 
From first vaccination up to 30 days post last vaccination, pIMDs were reported by subjects participating 
in ZOSTER-002 and ZOSTER-039, as displayed in Table 93. In ZOSTER-002, 4 subjects (0.4%) in the 
HZ/su group and 2 (0.2%) in the Placebo group experienced a pIMD. In the HZ/su group, 3 of the 4

events were serious (PTs: autoimmune hemolytic anemia, interstitial lung disease, and psoriasis) and 
none of these 3 were considered related to vaccination as per investigator assessment. The other event 
(PT: psoriasis; pre-existing psoriasis reported as ‘psoriasis aggravated’) was not serious and considered 
related to vaccination as per investigator assessment. Both events in the Placebo group were not serious 
and not considered causally related to vaccination by the investigator. In ZOSTER-039, 1 subject (0.4%) 
in the HZ/su group reported an event of gout (note that gout was added to the pre-defined list of specific 
disorders after study completion). This event was not serious and not considered causally related to 
vaccination by the investigator. 
Table 93: Pivotal studies: Percentage of subjects reporting the occurrence of potentially 
immune-mediated diseases classified by MedDRA Primary System Organ Class and Preferred 
Term from first vaccination up to 30 days post last vaccination (Total Vaccinated Cohort)  
Potentially immune-mediated diseases from first vaccination up to 12 months post last vaccination: 
Across the pivotal studies, the percentage of subjects reporting the occurrence of at least 1 pIMD from 
first vaccination up to 12 months post last vaccination ranged between 0.0% and 3.0% in the HZ/su 
groups and between 0.7% and 1.5% in the Placebo groups (Table 94). 
The most frequently reported PTs (i.e., reported in ≥2 subjects in any study group) were the following: 
- Psoriasis, reported in 2 subjects (0.2%) in the HZ/su group and 1 (0.1%) in the Placebo group in 
ZOSTER-002; 
- Gout, reported in 1 subject (0.4%) in the HZ/su group in ZOSTER-039 and 2 (1.5%) in the HZ/su group 
in ZOSTER-041;

group in ZOSTER-002; 
In ZOSTER-002, in both the HZ/su and the Placebo group, the majority of pIMDs were serious. 
In ZOSTER-028, 1 subject (0.9%) in the Placebo group reported a serious event of autoimmune 
thyroiditis. 
In ZOSTER-039, in the HZ/su group, 1 event (erythema nodosum) was serious. In the Placebo group, the 
event of Guillain-Barré syndrome was serious. 
In ZOSTER-041, none of the events were serious.

The following events were considered causally related to vaccination by the investigator from first 
vaccination up to 12 months post last vaccination: 
- In ZOSTER-002, in the HZ/su group, 1 event of arthralgia, 1 event of cutaneous vasculitis (both 
reported in the same subject and serious), 1 event of psoriasis (not serious), and 1 event of immune 
thrombocytopenic purpura (serious); 
- In ZOSTER-039, in the Placebo group, 1 event of Guillain Barré syndrome (serious).

In ZOSTER-002, during the entire study period, a total of 14 pregnancy outcomes were reported in 11 
subjects (7 in the HZ/su group and 4 in the Placebo group). For all pregnancies, there was exposure to 
HZ/su or placebo before estimated pregnancy onset. In the HZ/su group, 7 pregnancies reported in 6 
subjects resulted in live infants with no apparent congenital anomaly and 1 pregnancy outcome in 1 other 
subject was an elective termination for socio-economic reasons. In the Placebo group, 4 pregnancies 
reported in 4 subjects resulted in live infants with no apparent congenital anomaly. One of these subjects 
also reported 2 events of spontaneous abortion with no apparent congenital anomaly. Pregnancy onset 
for 3 subjects was within 1 year after exposure to HZ/su (2 subjects) or placebo (1 subject). 
In ZOSTER-039, during the entire study period, there were 2 pregnancy reports in 1 subject in the HZ/su 
group. The subject was exposed to the second dose of HZ/su prior to estimated onset of both the first 
and the second pregnancy. Both pregnancies resulted in live infants with no apparent congenital 
anomalies at birth. However, for the first pregnancy, the infant was born at 36 weeks of gestation and 
died 30 minutes after birth due to breathing difficulty.  
In ZOSTER-041, during the entire study period, there was 1 pregnancy reported in 1 subject in the 
Placebo group, which resulted in spontaneous abortion with no apparent congenital anomaly. The subject 
was exposed to placebo prior to estimated pregnancy onset.

•  Relapse cases during the entire study period (ZOSTER-002) 
In ZOSTER-002, the percentage of subjects reporting a relapse of their underlying disease during the 
entire study period was within the same range in the HZ/su and the Placebo group (25.9% in the HZ/su 
group and 27.4% in the Placebo group). 
By PT, the incidence of the relapses of underlying diseases were within the same range in the HZ/su and 
the Placebo group. The most frequently reported PT was plasma cell myeloma (reported in 133 subjects 
[14.4%] in the HZ/su group and 143 [15.5%] in the Placebo group). Events reported in ≥1.0% of 
subjects in any treatment group included lymphoma (19 [2.1%] in the HZ/su group and 20 [2.2%] in the 
Placebo group), B-cell lymphoma (18 [2.0%] and 20 [2.2%], respectively), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma 
(16 [1.7%] and 13 [1.4%]), Hodgkin’s disease (12 [1.3%] and 9 [1.0%]), and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma 
(5 [0.5%] and 11 [1.2%], respectively). 
•  Disease progression during the entire study period (ZOSTER-002) 
In ZOSTER-002, the percentage of subjects with progression of their underlying disease during the entire 
study period was within the same range in the HZ/su and the Placebo group (8.8% in the HZ/su group 
and 8.9% in the Placebo group). 
The incidences of disease progressions were within the same range in the HZ/su and Placebo group. The 
most frequently reported PT was plasma cell myeloma (reported in 65 subjects [7.0%] in the HZ/su 
group and 64 [6.9%] in the Placebo group). 
•  Disease-related events from first vaccination up to study end (ZOSTER-039) 
In ZOSTER-039, the percentage of subjects reporting at least 1 DRE (i.e., a relapse case or progression of 
the underlying disease) from first vaccination up to study end was within the same range in the HZ/su 
and Placebo group (15.9% in the HZ/su group and 20.8% in the Placebo group). 
By PT, the incidence of the DREs were within the same range in the HZ/su and the Placebo group. Events 
reported in ≥1.0% of subjects in any treatment group included plasma cell myeloma (reported in 12 
subjects [4.2%] in the HZ/su group and 20 [7.2%] in the Placebo group), acute myeloid leukemia (7 
[2.5%] and 16 [5.7%], respectively), chronic lymphocytic leukemia (4 [1.4%] and 4 [1.4%], 
respectively), pneumonia (4 [1.4%] and none, respectively), Hodgkin’s disease (3 [1.1%] and 1 [0.4%], 
respectively), and B-cell lymphoma (2 [0.7%] and 3 [1.1%], respectively). 
•  Renal allograft function from first vaccination up to study end (ZOSTER-041) 
To assess allograft function during the study, clinically obtained serum creatinine measurements were 
recorded in ZOSTER-041. From first vaccination up to study end, 20 subjects (15.3%) in the HZ/su group 
and 26 (19.7%) in the Placebo group had ≥1.20-fold increase in serum creatinine levels compared to 
baseline (i.e., ≥20% increase; a 20% margin allowed for daily fluctuations to not be interpreted as 
pathology). There were 4 (3.1%), 3 (2.3%), and 2 (1.5%) subjects in the HZ/su group and 4 (3.0%), 2 
(1.5%), and 1 (0.8%) in the Placebo group who had ≥1.50-, ≥1.75-, and ≥2-fold increases, respectively. 
In the HZ/su group, 16 subjects (12.1%) had renal biopsies, of whom 4 (3.0%) were positive for allograft 
rejection (biopsy-proven rejection). In total, 3 of the 4 biopsy-proven rejections occurred in subjects with 
medium-high rejection risk as defined by their calculated panel-reactive antibody (cPRA) scores. In the 
Placebo group, 23 subjects (17.4%) had renal biopsies, of whom 7 (5.3%) were positive for allograft 
rejection. The 7 biopsy-proven rejections occurred in subjects with low rejection risk based on cPRA 
scores. 
Of the subjects with biopsy-proven allograft rejection, 1 HZ/su recipient reported to the study site with 
acute symptoms of renal allograft dysfunction (i.e., for this subject, the diagnosis of the alloimmune 
response was clinically indicated), had a ≥2-fold increase in serum creatinine levels, and a biopsy-proven

rejection. For all other subjects, allograft biopsies were performed per study site’s surveillance protocol 
(i.e., not clinically indicated). 
•  Other events of medical interest reported as unsolicited adverse events within the 30-day 
post-vaccination period 
The percentage of subjects reporting the occurrence of additional events of medical interest as AE within 
the 30-day post-vaccination period is described in this section. 
Agranulocytosis and hematopoietic cytopenias: 
Across the pivotal studies, the percentage of subjects reporting the occurrence of at least 1 AE associated 
with agranulocytosis or hematopoietic cytopenia ranged between 0.8% and 17.9% in the HZ/su groups 
and between 0.0% and 16.5% in the Placebo groups. In each pivotal study, the incidence was within the 
same range in both groups. By PT, incidences were within the same range as well (Table 95).

Organ Class and Preferred Term within the 30-day (Days 0-29) post-vaccination period (Total 
Vaccinated Cohort)

Anaphylactic reactions: 
In ZOSTER-039, 1 AE of anaphylactic shock was reported in 1 subject (0.4%) in the Placebo group. In all 
other pivotal studies, no events of anaphylactic reaction were reported. 
Hemorrhagic and ischemic cerebrovascular conditions: 
No AEs of hemorrhagic or ischemic cerebrovascular conditions were reported in any of the pivotal studies. 
Infective pneumonia: 
Across the pivotal studies, the percentage of subjects reporting the occurrence of at least 1 AE associated 
with infective pneumonia ranged between 0.0% and 2.6% in the HZ/su groups and between 0.0% and 
1.4% in the Placebo groups. In each pivotal study, the incidence was within the same range in both 
groups. When considering the other reported PTs, incidences were within the same range in the HZ/su 
group and the Placebo group.

Upper respiratory tract infection: 
Across the pivotal studies, the percentage of subjects reporting the occurrence of at least 1 SAE 
associated with upper respiratory tract infection ranged between 0.7% and 1.7% in the HZ/su groups and 
between 0.0% and 0.9% in the Placebo groups. In each pivotal study, the incidence was within the same 
range in both groups. By PT, incidences were within the same range as well. 
Serious ocular complications that may be due to vasculitis or inflammation: 
No SAEs associated with ocular complications were reported in any of the pivotal studies. 
Laboratory findings 
In the pivotal studies, in the absence of a diagnosis, abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal 
assessments that were judged by the investigator to be clinically significant were recorded as AE or SAE if 
they met the definition. 
In ZOSTER-041, clinically obtained serum creatinine measures were recorded throughout the study to 
assess allograft function.  
For ZOSTER-001 and ZOSTER-015, details on the biochemical and haematological values for the selected 
parameters with respect to normal ranges and the changes from baseline are tabulated. 
In ZOSTER-001, at each time point in all 4 groups, subjects had analyte results generally within the 
normal range with the exception of red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit for which the 
majority of subjects in all groups were below the reference range at most time points including pre-
vaccination. This finding was considered most likely due to the disease state of the subjects. 
In ZOSTER-015, over 70% of subjects in both the gE/AS01B and the Placebo group had values of 
hematological and biochemical parameters within the normal range at all time points. 
No safety concerns arose from abnormal laboratory findings or other abnormal assessments in the 6 
studies. 
Post marketing experience 
From the time of first approval of Shingrix in the US (13 October 2017) until 12 April 2019 (data lock 
point of the current Periodic Benefit Risk Evaluation Report (PBRER), dated 14 June 2019), it is estimated 
that 11 636 236 doses have been distributed worldwide. As vaccination with Shingrix could vary between 
1 and 2 doses per subject depending on the compliance with the vaccination schedule, post-approval 
exposure to Shingrix is estimated to be between 5 818 118 and 11 636 236 subjects. 
Safety information received since licensure has been regularly reviewed by the GSK Vaccines Clinical 
Safety and Pharmacovigilance Department. The spontaneous reports received since launch of Shingrix are 
generally consistent with what has been observed in the clinical trials and the information provided in the 
Reference Safety Information for Shingrix. Most AEs reported are adverse reactions that are anticipated 
and consistent with the reactogenicity profile of the vaccine. The data on important risks has remained 
unchanged since marketing authorisation was granted. Additionally, there have been no new data from 
studies in adults suggesting that efficacy is lower than that described in the submission dossiers. Since 
launch, no actions were taken for safety reasons concerning withdrawal, rejection or suspension of a 
Marketing Authorisation.

2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Known safety profile: 
In the clinical studies included in the main and broader safety pooling analyses submitted for initial 
licensure, a total of 14,645 (ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022 pivotal trials) and 15,493 (ZOSTER-006 and 
ZOSTER-022 pivotal trials and additional supportive studies) older adults ≥50 YOA have been vaccinated 
with at least one dose of HZ/su, respectively. Based on the data submitted at MAA, there was no 
identified risk.  
The following important potential risks were listed at MAA: (i) Risk of pIMDs following Shingrix 
vaccination; (ii) Virus reactivation in immunocompetent individuals with a history of Herpes Zoster. The 
latter concern is based on an observation from a small study (ZOSTER-33) performed in subjects with 
past history of Shingles which pointed to an unexpectedly high incidence of Shingles following HZ/su 
administration. ZOSTER-062 is conducted to meet this concern. Limited data from a post hoc analysis on 
the incidence of Herpes Zoster (HZ) and HZ-related adverse events in patients with a history of HZ versus 
no history of HZ in the pivotal IC studies do not raise concern.  
Given the theoretical risk of exacerbating pre-existing pIMDs due to the inflammatory process induced by 
Shingrix, ‘use in adults with pre-existing pIMD’ has been considered as a missing information at licensure. 
The MAH recently submitted a Type-II variation to provide data (clinical studies, post-marketing data, 
observed/expected analysis and literature review) to support the MAH position that vaccination with 
Shingrix does not increase the risk of disease exacerbation in patients with pre-existing pIMDs (refer to 
EMEA/H/C/004336/II/0031).  
In the pre-licensure clinical trials, which are not designed to assess rare outcomes, numerical differences 
between Shingrix and Placebo groups were noted for certain conditions, including: polymyalgia 
rheumatica (PMR), giant cell arteritis (GCA), Ischemic optic neuropathy (ION), Supraventricular 
tachycardia (SVT), and gout. After licensure, using an algorithm that preferentially maximizes sensitivity 
over specificity, the U.S. Vaccine Safety Datalink detected a statistical signal for Guillain-Barré syndrome 
(GBS) during active surveillance for Shingrix safety. Two PASS are ongoing to evaluate the safety of 
Shingrix in adults ≥50 years of age in the United States: EPI-ZOSTER-030/032. 
From the time of first approval of Shingrix in the US (13 October 2017) until 12 April 2019 (data lock 
point of the current PBRER of the PBRER submitted on 17 June 2019), exposure to Shingrix is estimated 
to be between 5 818 118 and 11 636 236 subjects. The spontaneous reports received since launch of 
Shingrix are generally consistent with what has been observed in the clinical trials and the information 
provided in the Reference Safety Information for Shingrix. No safety signal was confirmed since MA.  
Safety database in the proposed extension of indication: 
In all 6 studies included in this application, a total of 1,587 subjects received at least 1 dose of HZ/su 
(443 subjects 18-49 YOA and 1,144 subjects ≥50 YOA). In the 4 pivotal studies, a total of 1,454 subjects 
received at least 1 dose of HZ/su (383 subjects 18-49 YOA and 1,071 ≥50 YOA). ZOSTER-002 makes the 
largest contribution (approximately 60%) to the safety database of the subjects exposed to HZ/su. (230 
subjects 18-49 YOA and 692 ≥50 YOA), followed by ZOSTER-039 (230 subjects 18-49 YOA and 692 ≥50 
YOA). In the 4 pivotal studies, the compliance with the 2-dose schedule ranged from 83% to 96% in the 
HZ/su groups, in both age stratum. 
The mean age at first vaccination with HZ/su (gE/AS01B) ranged between 47 and 58 YOA across studies. 
In ZOSTER-002 and ZOSTER-039, multiple myeloma was the most common underlying diseases. In 
ZOSTER-028, the most frequently reported solid tumor diagnoses were breast and colorectal tumors. The 
demographic characteristics were generally balanced between the HZ/su and Placebo groups. Groups 
were also comparable with respect to reported underlying diagnoses. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 150/173 
 
 
  
  
The overall number of subjects in the safety database of IC patients is acceptable, considering the overall 
safety data already available for Shingrix. The number of IC subjects in the 18-49 YOA category (443 
subjects) is limited but acceptable as: (i) there is no theoretical safety concern which is specific to this 
age category, (ii) this number is sufficient to assess whether reactogenicity is higher in the younger vs. 
oldest IC subjects. The safety data base however is limited (10 times lower than the database generated 
for immunocompetent individuals ≥50 YOA), and the population is extremely heterogeneous in terms of 
disease profile and treatment received. Important uncertainties thus remain with respect to the adverse 
events induced by vaccination in IC subjects. 
The population targeted by the proposed indication is broader than the population included in the 
submitted ‘IC’ trials, among others subjects 18-49 YOA who are at-risk of HZ but not IC Only very limited 
data on these subjects are available from the early development of Shingrix. These data were generated 
in the exploratory phase I/II study EXPLO-CRD-004. This study evaluated the safety and immunogenicity 
of Shingrix in healthy subject 18-30 YOA (n=10) and 50-69 YOA (n=45). Solicited AE were very frequent 
in that study, and there was a trend for higher reactogenicity in the 18-30 YOA stratum when compared 
to the 50-69 YOA stratum for local and general solicited AEs. The available data are too limited to draw 
conclusions about reactogenicity in immunocompetent individuals 18-49 YOA, and about the magnitude of 
the age trend in immunocompetent individuals. It is however very likely that such age trend is present: 
(i) there is such trend in IC (see below), (ii) there is such trend amongst ‘immunocompetent’ adults ≥50 
YOA, (iii) the literature suggest that incidence of solicited AEs seems lower with increasing age.  
VZV circulates widely in Europe and above 95% of adults has antibodies against VZV. In most EU 
countries, the acquisition of antibodies to VZV takes place in the early childhood. The data from the 
pivotal trials are in line with this seroprevalence level. However, in some of the EU countries such as 
Germany and Italy, the circulation of the wild VZV is expected to diminish as a consequence of childhood 
varicella vaccination policies, which could potentially result in an increase in the proportion of 
(unvaccinated) adults who never had primary VZV infection. At this moment, the risk to inadvertently 
vaccinate a VZV-naïve individual is low and only a limited number of naïve subjects can be identified in 
the clinical studies implemented for Shingrix. The MAH performed a pooled analysis considering data from 
all 6 studies conducted in IC populations. Reactogenicity data from Shingrix vaccinated subjects who were 
seronegative at baseline (n=77) were compared to those from the overall group of vaccinees (n=1553). 
The seronegative group may include both true ‘VZV-naïve’ subjects and not necessary ‘VZV-naïve’ 
subjects (because of no detectable antibodies or loss of antibodies over time).  The reactogenicity profile 
observed in baseline-seronegative subjects (local and systemic solicited AE, per dose and per subject) did 
not raise any concern. The MAH previously committed to include an update of the epidemiology of VZV in 
Europe in the section Part II module SI “Epidemiology of the indicator(s) and target population(s)” of the 
EU-RMP with recent published data.  
Safety methods: 
Safety endpoints, definitions, assessment methods (grading scale and causality assessments) and 
reporting periods are appropriate. Methods were consistent over the trials submitted in this application, 
and also consistent with those of the pivotal trials submitted at MAA. In addition to the predefined safety 
endpoints (AE, SAE, MAE, suspected herpes zoster and herpes zoster complications, pIMD, relapse cases, 
disease progression, biopsy-proven renal allograft rejections, hematological and biochemical parameters), 
other events of medical interest were tabulated post-hoc for the pivotal studies. These events were 
selected based on the most frequently reported events observed in the IC clinical studies, medically 
relevant events for the specific populations, or previous feedback from regulatory authorities. These 
events include: agranulocytosis and hematopoietic cytopenias, anaphylactic reactions, haemorrhagic and 
ischemic cerebrovascular conditions, infective pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections, serious 
ocular complications that may be due to vasculitis or inflammation.

Reactogenicity: 
Local reactogenicity in the 4 pivotal IC studies: 
In ZOSTER-002, 85.8% of the subjects (vs. 10.4% in the Placebo group) had at least one solicited local 
symptom. Similar frequencies were found across the pivotal studies (83.8%-87.8% per subject). The 
frequency of grade 3 solicited local symptoms following HZ/su was 14.2% per subject in study ZOSTER-
002, and similar across the 4 pivotal studies (10.7%-14.2% per subject). In the Placebo group, the 
frequency of grade 3 solicited local symptoms was <0.5% (per dose or subject). Pain occurred in 79.5%-
87.0% of subjects (83.9% in ZOSTER-002). There was a high frequency of grade 3 pain (9.8%-11.0% of 
subjects, 11.0% in ZOSTER-002). Median duration of pain was 3.0 days across studies.  
Systemic reactogenicity in the 4 pivotal IC studies: 
The frequency of solicited general symptoms (at least one symptom) was 75.2% per subject (vs. 50.9% 
in the Placebo group) in study ZOSTER-002. A similar frequency of solicited general symptoms was found 
across studies in the HZ/su and in the Placebo groups (68.7%-81.3% per subject in the HZ/su group vs. 
48.9%-66.4% in the Placebo group). The frequency was high in the control groups, reflecting the 
underlying population.  
As expected, the discrepancies between groups was much more marked for grade 3 events than for 
events of any grade. The frequency of grade 3 solicited general symptoms following HZ/su was 13.2% 
per subject (vs. 6.0% in the Placebo group) in study ZOSTER-002. A similar frequency of grade 3 solicited 
general symptoms was found across the pivotal studies in the HZ/su group (9.9%-22.3% per subject).  
Fatigue, headache, myalgia were the most frequently reported symptoms associated with HZ/su 
administration. The association of gastrointestinal symptoms with HZ/su administration is not clear. 
Shivering and fever were frequently reported as well, and strongly associated with HZ/su. There was an 
approximately three-fold to four-fold increase in the frequency of fever in the HZ/su vs. Placebo group. 
The frequency of fever (>37.5°) ranged from 9.0% to 15.8% (12.1% in ZOSTER-002) per dose in the 
HZ/su group (<5.0% in the Placebo groups, 3.2% in ZOSTER-002), depending on the studies.  
Across the pivotal studies, in the HZ/su groups, the median duration of solicited general symptoms was at 
most 3.0 days. The maximal duration was 7 days. 
Comparison to reactogenicity data at initial MAA: 
Of the subjects ≥50 YOA (ZOSTER-006), 81.5% experienced at least one solicited local symptom (9.5% 
for grade 3), and 79.1% experienced pain at the site of administration (6.7% grade 3 pain). At least one 
solicited general symptom was reported for 66.1% of subjects, and at least one grade 3 solicited general 
symptom for 11.4% of subjects. The most frequently reported solicited general symptoms were myalgia 
and fatigue. Fever (≥37.5°C) was reported in 21.5% of the subjects. In general, local and general 
symptoms lasted for a few days (median duration was 3 days for pain, days for myalgia and fatigue, 1 
day for fever).  
In the ‘IC’ studies, the frequencies of both solicited local and general symptoms following HZ/su were in 
the same range in the adults ≥18 YOA enrolled in the ‘IC’ studies and in immunocompetent adults ≥50 
YOA (ZOSTER-006). Available data are too limited to draw conclusions on the reactogenicity profile of 
‘immunocompetent’ versus ‘IC’ individuals 18-49 YOA. When restricting the comparison to 
‘immunocompetent’ and ‘IC’ populations ≥50 YOA, there was no substantial difference. However, there 
are limitations in comparing those populations in terms of systemic AEs, as the frequency of systemic 
events is high in the Placebo group of the IC studies. The frequency of systemic events attributable to 
HZ/su may be overestimated in the IC studies. Overall, it is considered likely that reactogenicity is higher 
in ‘immunocompetent’ compared with ‘IC’ population of similar age groups.

EMA/447929/2020

Age trend: 
There was a general trend towards higher point estimates in the 18-49 YOA stratum compared to the ≥50 
YOA stratum for the majority of the solicited local symptoms. In all pivotal studies, the frequency of 
(grade 3) pain was higher in the 18-49 years of age subjects, compared to the ≥50 years of age subjects 
(approximately 1.5-fold higher frequency of grade 3 pain). In contrast, there was no clear age trend in 
terms of frequency of general solicited symptoms, except for fever and shivering. In ZOSTER-002, a 
higher frequency (i.e., higher point estimates) of fever, shivering and grade 3 shivering was observed in 
the 18-49 YOA stratum (17.6%, 22.8%, 3.8% per dose and 27.8%, 31.4%, 7.2% per subject) compared 
to the ≥50 YOA stratum (10.3%, 15.6%, 1.5% per dose and 17.8%, 24.6%, 2.8% per subject) in HZ/su 
group in this study (while frequencies were similar across age categories in the Placebo Group). The 95% 
CI do not overlap for some of the comparisons such as for myalgia in the ZOSTER-039, and for grade 3 
fatigue in the ZOSTER-002. There is a consistent trend across studies, but the comparison are not 
statistically meaningful in all studies, as the 95% CI overlap in many instances. The MAH performed a 
pooled analysis from all 6 studies conducted in IC populations. This analysis confirms what was observed 
in the individual studies. Pain at the injection site and most of the general AEs (fatigue, headache, 
myalgia, fever and shivering) were more frequent in the age stratum 18-49 YOA as compared to the age 
stratum ≥50 YOA.  
In the data submitted at licensure, there is a clearly higher local and general reactogenicity observed with 
decreasing age within the ≥50 YOA population of the ZOSTER-006 trial (encompassing immunocompetent 
individuals, including patients with comorbidities). Only very limited data from the early development of 
HZ/su are available for immunocompetent subjects 18-49 YOA.  
Safety findings in the submitted studies: 
The analysis of unsolicited AEs classified by MedDRA Primary SOC points to a higher frequency of cardiac 
disorders in HZ/su over 30 days post-vaccination compared to Placebo vaccinees. Number are small, and 
95% CI are in the same range. The MAH presented a pooled analysis of the cardiac disorders that did not 
identify any safety concern.  
There were 2 cases of supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) assessed as not related to vaccination by the 
investigator. Nevertheless, SVT is included as event of interest in the post-authorization safety studies 
EPI-ZOSTER-030 and EPI-ZOSTER-032. In addition, 1 subject presented a SAE ‘atrial fibrillation’ 
considered as causally related to vaccination by the investigator.  
This analysis of unsolicited AEs by SOC also pointed to imbalances for eye disorders and urinary/renal 
disorders over 30 days post-vaccination compared to Placebo vaccinees. An imbalance for the PT of upper 
respiratory tract infection was reported with significantly higher incidence in the HZ/su group than in the 
Placebo in ZOSTER-039. The MAH presented a pooled analysis of the disorders for which an imbalance 
was observed. The review of the post hoc pooled analysis did not identify any safety concern.  
Across several studies, there was an approximately two-fold higher frequency of the AE ‘febrile 
neutropenia’, the grade 3 AE ‘febrile neutropenia’ and the SAE ‘febrile neutropenia’ over the period up to 
30 days post second vaccination, in HZ/su vs. Placebo vaccinees. The MAH was requested to present 
additional data and discuss the biological plausibility. IC patients enrolled in studies ZOSTER-002, 
ZOSTER-028 and ZOSTER-039, diagnosed with malignancies and receiving chemotherapy, are at high risk 
of neutropenia and resultant infections. Febrile neutropenia is one of the most frequent and serious 
complications of cancer chemotherapy. In the pooled analysis combining safety data from the 6 IC 
studies, Shingrix administration was associated with an approximately two-fold increased risk of the 
(grade 3) AE and SAE ‘febrile neutropenia’ occurring up to 30 days post last vaccination. Numbers are 
limited and the 95% CI widely overlapping. The data per study indicate no imbalance in ZOSTER-002 (the 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

largest trial) for febrile neutropenia. There was also no imbalance for neutropenia, but there was an 
imbalance for grade 3 neutropenia. Imbalances for febrile neutropenia were seen in ZOSTER-039 and 
ZOSTER-028 only, which are the studies with the highest frequency of febrile neutropenia. In these 
studies, an imbalance was seen for febrile neutropenia, but not for neutropenia and neutropenic sepsis. 
Neutropenia often occurs between 7 and 12 days after receipt of chemotherapy [CDC]. In both studies, 
nearly all subjects who experienced febrile neutropenia as an unsolicited AE within 30 days post each 
vaccination received cancer chemotherapy within 15 days prior to its onset. 
It was noted that transient Neutropenia is described as an AE after vaccination for several vaccines also in 
healthy adults in literature (Muturi-Kioi et al). Post-vaccination neutropenia is generally clinically benign 
and occurs typically in the first two weeks after vaccination. Four studies assessed neutrophil counts pre- 
and post-vaccination at specific time points according to protocol. In two studies (one in HIV-infected 
individuals, the other in adults ≥60 YOA), a higher frequency of neutrophils below the cut-off was 
observed at M2 post HZ/su vaccination vs. pre-vaccination. However, no AE ‘neutropenia’ or ‘febrile 
neutropenia’ were reported in these two studies. In addition, such transient fall in neutrophil counts was 
not consistently seen in the other two studies.  
It was noted that over the period up to 30 days post second vaccination, the SAE ‘pneumonia’ was 
reported more frequently in the HZ/su vs. Placebo Group in ZOSTER-002 and ZOSTER-039 (no case in 
the other two studies). A pooled analysis was performed to combine safety data from the 6 IC studies. 
This pooled analysis confirmed a trend for more frequent pneumonia in the HZ/su vs. Placebo groups over 
the period up to 30 days post second vaccination. The data are limited and 95% CI are widely 
overlapping. There was no imbalance in the frequency of unsolicited AEs under the SOC Infections and 
infestations reported within the 30-day post each vaccination with Shingrix (16.3% in the Shingrix group 
and 15.2% in the placebo group). 
Given the limitations of the data sources utilized in the 2 PASS studies EPI-ZOSTER-030 and EPI-
ZOSTER-032, it is not warranted to include febrile neutropenia and serious infections as outcomes in 
these studies. The MAH will discuss cases of neutropenia (including febrile neutropenia and neutropenic 
sepsis) and of serious infections (including pneumonia) as events of special interest through the PSUR. 
No increase in the occurrence of disease relapse cases, disease progression, biopsy-proven renal allograft 
rejections was observed in the HZ/su vs. Placebo groups in the pivotal studies. 
From first vaccination up to 12 months post last vaccination, pIMDs were reported in 20 (21 events) and 
13 subjects respectively in the HZ/su and Placebo groups of the four studies.  
- 
In the HZ/su subjects, the following events occurred: autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Histiocytosis 
haematophagic, Immune thrombocytopenic purpura, Autoimmune pancytopenia, Autoimmune 
thyroiditis, Myelitis, Gout (n=3), Type 1 diabetes mellitus, Arthralgia, Polymyalgia rheumatic, Facial 
paralysis, Optic neuritis, IgA nephropathy, Interstitial lung disease, Cutaneous vasculitis, Erythema 
nodosum, Hypersensitivity vasculitis, Psoriasis and Psoriasis Aggravated). 
- 
In the Placebo subjects, the following events occurred: autoimmune hemolytic anemia, Autoimmune 
thyroiditis, Myelitis, Type 1 diabetes mellitus, Spondylitis, Systemic scleroderma, Facial paralysis, 
Guillain-Barre syndrome, IgA nephropathy (n=2), Interstitial lung disease (n=2), Psoriasis. 
Numerical imbalances between Shingrix and Placebo groups were noted in the pre-licensure trials for the 
pIMDS polymyalgia rheumatica [PMR], giant cell arteritis [GCA], Ischemic optic neuropathy [ION]. In the 
IC studies, one case of PMR and one case of optic neuritis were reported in HZ/su vaccinated subjects, 
and none in the Placebo subjects. The present data in IC subjects are thus consistent with imbalances. 
Two PASS are ongoing to evaluate the safety of Shingrix in adults ≥50 years of age in the United States: 
EPI-ZOSTER-030/032. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 154/173 
 
 
  
  
Numerical imbalances between Shingrix and Placebo groups were also noted in the pre-licensure trials for 
gout. Within the 30-day period following the last vaccination, there were 27 (0.18% [95% CI: 0.12-
0.27]) and 8 (0.05% [95% CI: 0.02-0.11]) subjects in the RZV and Placebo groups, respectively, who 
reported an event of gout or gouty arthritis (relative risk [RR] 3.38 [95% CI: 1.49- 8.60]) (Source: PASS 
protocols, EPI-ZOSTER-030/032). Stimulation of inflammatory responses, in particular involving IL1, is a 
trigger of gout. It is considered plausible that vaccination with HZ/su triggers the clinical manifestations 
of gout in individuals with high uric acid. The MAH was invited to discuss the cases in the IC studies. 
Three non-serious cases of gout were reported in immunocompromised population (1 in study ZOSTER-
039 and 2 in study ZOSTER-041), all in HZ/su group. In the pooling of the 6 IC studies, no other cases of 
gout were retrieved in the HZ/su group while two cases of gout were reported in the placebo group. 
Therefore there was no indication of an imbalance regarding gout in the IC population. In addition, time 
of occurrence of the 3 cases in the HZ/su group (31 days, 91 days, and 307 days post-vaccination) is not 
consistent with the hypotheses of clinical manifestations of gout triggered by reactogenicity in individuals 
with high uric acid (prevalent in patients under chemotherapies and patients with impaired renal 
function). Nevertheless, the MAH acknowledged that one of the cases of gout reported in PM could have 
been triggered following a possible dehydration due to severe reactogenicity after vaccination. The MAH 
intends to generate further data to investigate a possible putative association between Shingrix 
vaccination and increased risk of gout, if any, in studies EPI-ZOSTER-030 and EPIZOSTER-032. 
There were more pIMDs under the SOC Blood and lymphatic system disorders in the HZ/su vs. Placebo 
Groups. The MAH was invited to discuss whether autoimmune haematological diseases could be related to 
vaccination, in the context of the signal related to febrile neutropenia. The pooled data from the IC 
studies showed no statistically and/or medically relevant differences between subjects vaccinated with 
Shingrix compared to subjects receiving placebo. The number of cases was very low and most cases 
could be attributed to the underlying disease. In addition, none of these events were co-reported with 
febrile neutropenia.  
An imbalance was also seen for cutaneous vasculitis in the pivotal IC studies, with two cases in the HZ/su 
groups and none in the Placebo groups. Narrative were discussed, and it was concluded that the available 
data on cutaneous vasculitis did not highlight a safety concern. The MAH is continuously monitoring 
pIMDs, which includes immune mediated vasculitis, by enhanced pharmacovigilance activities. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
No data from the paediatric population were collected in the submitted trials. A PIP was submitted to the 
EMA on 12 March 2013. The Paediatric Committee (PDCO) granted a positive opinion on the PIP for the 
prevention of VZV reactivation in immunocompromised persons 1 to 17 years of age. The clinical trials 
ZOSTER-047 (a dose-confirmation study) and ZOSTER-040 (a safety/immunogenicity study with the 
selected dose) in IC persons 1-17 YOA were endorsed. The plan is fully deferred and will be initiated after 
establishment of the positive benefit/risk of HZ/su in IC adults. A waiver was granted for new-borns and 
infants from birth to less than 1 year of age. The EMA decision dated 29 July 2013 (reference 
P/0168/2013) confirmed the agreement of the PIP and the granting of the deferral and the waiver. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Shingrix induces high transient local and systemic reactogenicity in adults ≥18 YOA who are 
immunocompromised (IC) due to disease or therapy.  
The study design does not allow a direct comparison between the reactogenicity of HZ/su in 
immunocompromised individuals and not immunocompromised individuals. Nonetheless, the 
reactogenicity profile observed in IC patients ≥18 YOA seems consistent with the data submitted at 
licensure for immunocompetent adults ≥50 YOA. This pattern reflects a short-term inflammatory 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 155/173 
 
 
  
  
response induced by this adjuvanted vaccine. There is a clearly increasing reactogenicity with lowering 
age. There are only very limited data on reactogenicity in individuals 18-49 YOA who are not IC.  
The safety database of IC patients is acceptable but limited. Moreover, the population of IC patients is 
extremely heterogeneous. Uncertainties thus remain with respect to the adverse events induced by 
vaccination in IC populations, and within subgroups of this population. In addition, the population 
targeted by the proposed indication is broader than the population included in the submitted ‘IC’ trials. 
Beside immunosuppressive diseases and treatments, many chronic diseases lead to an increased risk of 
HZ.  
Overall, no new safety signal has been confirmed in the IC studies. In patients at high-risk of such 
conditions, the data point to non-statistically significant imbalances in febrile neutropenia and pneumonia 
over the period up to 30 days post second vaccination (approximately two-fold increased frequency in 
vaccinated vs. placebo). These events will be followed in the PSUR.  
As in immunocompetent individuals, this adjuvanted vaccine with high reactogenicity could trigger pIMDs 
and exacerbations of pre-existing pIMDs in IC patients. The latter theoretical concern becomes even more 
important with this extension of indication as individuals with pre-existing pIMDs are part of the 
population ‘at-risk’ of HZ.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been 
updated. In addition, the list of excipients has been updated in section 6 of the SmPC.   
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Annex II and IIIA have been updated to implement some editorial changes.  
2.7.1.  User consultation 
No justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH. The MAH provided a comparison (table PI) between the content 
of the previous user tested Package leaflet versus the proposed version. Therefore, the changes to the 
package leaflet are minimal and do not require a full or reduced user consultation with target patient 
groups. However, for further variations affecting the content of the Package leaflet any information on the 
consultation with target patient groups, reduced testing or concerning a justification for not carrying out a 
readability test shall be submitted in the module 1.3.4. 
2.7.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Shingrix (herpes zoster vaccine (recombinant, 
adjuvanted) is included in the additional monitoring list as new active substance and biological<include 
reason(s) since April 2018.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Currently, Shingrix is indicated for prevention of herpes zoster (HZ) and post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN) in 
adults ≥50 YOA. The MAH proposes to amend the indication for Shingrix to include adults 18 years of age 
or older at increased risk of HZ to address the unmet medical need for HZ prevention in that population. 
The claimed indication is for prevention of herpes zoster (HZ) and post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), in (i) 
adults 50 years of age or older; (ii) adults 18 years of age or older at increased risk of HZ. 
Herpes Zoster, commonly known as shingles, is caused by the reactivation of latent VZV and is thought to 
be associated with a decline in cell-mediated immunity (CMI) due to aging or to an immunosuppressive 
illness or treatment. HZ typically presents as an acute, painful, vesicular eruption distributed along a 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 161/173 
 
 
  
  
single dermatome. The most common complication of HZ is PHN, which is often chronic and debilitating 
and difficult to treat effectively. Other less frequent HZ complications can also occur, including HZ 
ophthalmicus (HZO), neurological complications such as VZV encephalitis and meningitis, and 
disseminated HZ.  
Epidemiological evidence confirms that the risk of HZ increases dramatically in adults ≥18 YOA who are 
immunocompromised (IC), placing them at a risk comparable to and in many instances far exceeding the 
risk seen in the general adult population ≥50 YOA. IC individuals are not only at increased risk for the 
development of HZ but also develop more severe HZ episodes, and more complications such as 
cutaneous dissemination, visceral involvement (including varicella pneumonitis and hepatitis), VZV 
retinitis and acute retinal necrosis, and meningoencephalitis. Chronic HZ may also occur in IC patients.  
Beside immunosuppression, many chronic conditions such as diabetes, asthma, COPD, cardiovascular 
diseases, and renal diseases are associated with an increased risk of HZ. PHN also appears to be more 
severe and persistent in diabetic patients. 
Patients who undergo hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) show the highest risk for HZ among the 
immunocompromising conditions. Patients with malignancies are at risk for developing HZ, due to their 
underlying disease and immunosuppressive cancer therapy. Patients with autoimmune disease are also at 
increased risk of HZ reactivation. In addition to the risk autoimmune disease may independently pose, 
most of these conditions are managed with immunosuppressive therapies that impair T cell immunity.  
Disease-induced immunosuppression has been proposed as a mechanism for increasing the risk of HZ in 
patients with other chronic diseases that directly affect CMI like HIV as well as those with less well-
defined mechanism of immunosuppression like type II diabetes mellitus (Table 97: Summary of the HZ 
incidence in various populationsTable 97).

ethnicity are also associated with an increased risk of HZ (Marin 2016, Kawai 2017, Marra 2020). 
Results from a recent meta-analysis based on 88 studies, excluding studies that used immunosuppressive 
medications, are summarized below (Marra 2020) and confirm previous results observed in the meta-
analysis performed by Kawai in 2017 (

3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Antiviral treatment for HZ is available and has been shown to decrease the duration of HZ rash and the 
severity of pain associated with the rash. However, these benefits were most often demonstrated when 
patients are able to initiate antiviral therapy within 72 hours of onset of rash. Also, antiviral drugs were 
not conclusively shown to reduce the occurrence of PHN (meta-analyses of clinical trial data, Chen, 
2004).  
The duration of antiviral prophylaxis is not standardized for their use in HCT recipients and the effect 
depends on adherence to treatment. There is a high risk of HZ occurring once prophylaxis has stopped.  
There is currently no licensed vaccine for the prevention of HZ in IC populations. Zostavax® (Merck & Co) 
is a live attenuated VZV vaccine, licensed in multiple countries to prevent HZ in persons ≥50 years of 
age.  
The spectrum of subjects who are ‘at increased risk of HZ’, and may benefit from Shingrix, is broad and 
heterogeneous.  
The unmet need is unquestionable for those with the highest burden of disease, i.e. patients who are 
immunodeficient or immunosuppressed due to disease or therapy (such as patients with malignancies, 
transplantation, autoimmune diseases, or patients with congenital immunodeficiencies). These patients 
are at increased risk of shingles and also experience more severe pain, and serious complications, as 
described above. Chronic herpes zoster may also occur in immunocompromised patients. Moreover, the 
live-attenuated VZV vaccine (Zostavax®,Merck & Co) is contraindicated in them due to concerns of 
possible vaccine-associated disseminated disease. Shingrix can also benefit those who might require IS 
treatment in the future. 
There also is a clear unmet need in certain adult sub-populations with chronic medical conditions 
predisposing them to HZ (e.g., COPD, cardiovascular diseases, renal disease, rheumatoid arthritis, 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 163/173 
 
 
  
  
 
asthma, type 2 diabetes mellitus), including patients taking low-dose immunosuppressive therapy (e.g., 
low dose of prednisone). 
The unmet need might be less clear for other individuals with risk factors, such as stress, depression, or 
recent trauma, although they could also be considered at increased risk. Vaccination might be beneficial 
for some of them and this should be considered on a case-by-case basis. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence of efficacy in immunocompromised (IC) patients was generated in a phase III 
multicentre, randomized, observer-blind study comparing HZ/su (n=922) vs. saline placebo (n=924) in 
autologous HCT recipients ≥18 YOA vaccinated 50 to 70 days after transplant (ZOSTER-002). 
VE was also assessed as post-hoc analysis in a second Phase III multicentre, randomized, observer-blind 
study comparing HZ/su (n=283) vs. saline placebo (n=279) in subjects ≥18 YOA with haematologic 
malignancies who were vaccinated during a cancer therapy course or after a full cancer therapy course 
(ZOSTER-039). 
Vaccine immunogenicity was assessed in 3 Phase III and 1 Phase II/III randomised, observer-blind, 
placebo-controlled, multi-center studies. In addition to studies ZOSTER-002 and ZOSTER-039, study 
ZOSTER-028 and study ZOSTER-041 assessed both humoral and cellular immunity. ZOSTER-028 included 
adults with solid malignancies vaccinated during or 8-30 days prior to chemotherapy (n=117 and n=115 
for HZ/su and placebo respectively). ZOSTER-041 included renal transplant recipients under ongoing IS 
therapy (n=132 for both for HZ/su and placebo). 
These studies were multi-country studies conducted worldwide. In all 4 pivotal studies, HZ/su was 
administered according to a 2-dose flexible schedule, with the second vaccine dose being administered 1 
to 2 months after the first dose. 
The MAH also undertook two supportive studies (in HIV infected individuals, and in patients who had 
HCT). 
A total of 1,587 subjects received at least 1 dose of HZ/su (443 subjects 18-49 YOA and 1,144 subjects 
≥50 YOA) in all 6 studies included in this application. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Efficacy against HZ  
In study ZOSTER-002, a total of 184 subjects reported a confirmed HZ episode, amongst which 49 were 
in the HZ/su group and 135 in the Placebo group. The overall incidence of HZ per 1000 person-years was 
30.0 in the HZ/su group and 94.3 in the Placebo group, over a median follow-up time of 21 months. The 
overall HZ VE was 68.17% (95% CI: 55.56 - 73.57; p-value < 0.0001) over 21 months. The primary 
objective of study ZOSTER-002 regarding HZ VE was met as the LL of the 95% CI was above 0%.  
A similar level of efficacy was found in the post-hoc analysis performed in study ZOSTER-039. The VE was 
87.2% (95%CI: 44.25 - 98.59) over a median follow-up time of 11 months, based on 2 and 14 subjects 
with confirmed HZ episodes respectively in the HZ/su group and in the Placebo group.  
Efficacy was lower compared to that found in immunocompetent individuals 50 YOA and over (97% for 
HZ). 
Efficacy against HZ complications 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 164/173 
 
 
  
  
In study ZOSTER-002, of the 10 subjects with PHN episode(s), 1 was in the HZ/su group and 9 in the 
Placebo group. The overall incidence of PHN per 1000 person-years was 0.5 in the HZ/su group and 4.9 in 
the Placebo group. The overall PHN VE was of 89.27% (95% CI: 22.54% - 99.76%).  
Reported HZ complications related to confirmed HZ (other than PHN) were HZ meningoencephalitis (1 
subject in the Placebo group) and HZ cutaneous disseminated (3 subjects in the HZ/su group and 12 
subjects in the Placebo group). HZ/su efficacy was also demonstrated against HZ related complications, 
with an overall VE of 77.76% (95% CI: 19.05% - 95.93%).  
Other aspects of efficacy of study ZOSTER-002 
High VE was demonstrated when the vaccination occurs 50-70 days after transplant which is very early 
when compared with standard practice for vaccination of HCT transplant recipients. This indicates that 
HZ/su is efficacious when the immune responses are not yet reconstituted, and is beneficial to the patient 
since the first year following transplant is the period of highest HZ’s risk.  
The available data do not suggest that age importantly affects vaccine efficacy. VE in the two age strata 
(18-49 YOA and ≥50 YOA) was 71.77% (95% CI: 38.75% - 88.25%) in the younger, versus 67.34% 
(95% CI: 52.60% - 77.89%) in the older age cohort, 95% CIS were overlapping. VE against PHN could 
be shown (89.27% [95% CI: 22.54% - 99.76%]), 10 subjects with PHN in the HZ/su group versus 9 in 
the placebo group. 
VE was demonstrated by using a flexible 2-dose vaccination schedule, with the second dose being 
administered 1 to 2 months after the first. This offers a flexibility for the vaccination of IC subjects who 
may need protection as early as possible. 
Pain duration was reduced in vaccinated vs. Placebo confirmed HZ cases. The median duration of severe 
‘worst’ HZ-associated pain was 14.0 days (min.-max. 1.0-178.0) in the HZ/su group and 24.0 days (1.0-
1025.0) in the Placebo group. In the HZ/su group less subjects with a confirmed HZ episode used 3 or 
more pain medications compared to the placebo group (10.2% vs. 27.4%). The duration of pain 
medication was shorter in the HZ/su group (median 21.5 days [min – max: 1.0 –436.0]) compared with 
the Placebo group (median 47.5 [min - max 1.0 – 1642.0]). 
HZ-related hospitalization occurred in 2 subjects of the HZ/su group and 13 subjects of the Placebo 
group. The VE against first or only episode of confirmed HZ-related hospitalizations was 84.70% (95% 
CI: 32.15% - 96.55%). 
Immunogenicity 
The vaccine was shown to be immunogenic in all IC populations included in the 4 pivotal trials. 
Immunogenicity was also demonstrated in the supportive trial ZOSTER-015 that included HIV-infected 
adults. 
Two intramuscular doses of the vaccine on a 2-dose flexible schedule elicited robust anti-gE ELISA titres 
and CMI responses to gE. GMCs of anti-gE Ab and frequencies of gE-specific CD4 [2+] T cells at 1 month 
post-Dose 2 decreased afterwards but remained higher than the baseline level at least up to 1 year post-
Dose 2 (all pivotal trials), and up to 2 years post-Dose 2 (evaluated in ZOSTER-002). 
The confirmatory primary and secondary objectives in terms of adjusted GMC ratio and VRR in anti-gE 
humoral immune responses were met in all IC studies with confirmatory objectives, except for study 
ZOSTER-002 for which objectives were descriptive. In solid tumor patients (ZOSTER-028), the 
confirmatory objective in terms of adjusted GM ratio for gE-specific CMI responses was met.  In 
chronically immunosuppressed renal transplant recipients (ZOSTER-041), both confirmatory objectives in 
terms of adjusted GM ratio and VRR for gE-specific CMI responses were met.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
A correlate of protection (CoP) has not been established. Because of their altered immune system and in 
contrast to immunocompetent subjects, circulating Ab titers might not be a good marker to evaluate the 
protective response in IC patients. The quality of the humoral immune response might be different 
compared to immunocompetent people. This also applies to CMI. An additional limitation in interpreting 
CMI results is that they were expressed in percentages and the number of circulating CD4 T cells may 
vary according to several factors, including underlying diseases and IS treatment. The level of efficacy 
can therefore not be derived from the immunogenicity data generated in the patients with solid 
malignancies vaccinated just before or during chemotherapy, in patients who had undergone a solid 
organ transplant, and in HIV-infected individuals. The level of efficacy can also not be derived according 
to the timing of IS therapy respective to vaccination, and for the various types of IS therapies, of which 
several may greatly affect vaccine-induced responses. 
In ZOSTER-002 and ZOSTER-039 (the studies which generated the efficacy data), most subjects did not 
receive IS therapies during or shortly after the vaccination course. The level of efficacy in patients under 
concomitant IS therapy is not known.  
In ZOSTER-002 and ZOSTER-039 respectively, exploratory analyses did not suggest an important impact 
of underlying disease on VE. VE was also in the same range whether the vaccine was administered during 
or after the immunosuppressive cancer therapy course. However, the VE results observed in the sub-
groups should be interpreted with caution because of very wide 95% CI. 
The level of efficacy is unknown for patients presenting with other risk factors of HZ, such as patients 
with chronic conditions treated with corticoids. In the context of the MAA, the MAH undertook a post-hoc 
exploratory analysis of the pivotal trials (ZOSTER-006 and ZOSTER-022), which suggests that that HZ/su 
remains high in patients with common conditions that affect the risk of HZ and PHN, such as chronic 
obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), depression, and diabetes. This is 
reassuring, but estimates are imprecise. 
Differences in the magnitude of immune responses were observed depending on IC condition.   
In studies ZOSTER-002 and ZOSTER-039, immune responses were lower in subjects with non-Hodgkin B-
cell lymphoma and Chronic lymphocytic leukemia than in subjects with other malignancies. This is likely 
caused by B-cell depletion induced by the anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab, which is typically 
given to these patients before HCT. Beside this indirect evidence , there is no data according to type of 
therapy, with the exception of ZOSTER-041 which suggest no profound impact of the type of IS therapy 
used in renal transplant recipients. New therapies were since used or may be developed, for which the 
impact on immune response might be important.  
Lower humoral immune responses were observed when Shingrix was administered during versus before 
or after IS cancer therapy.  
Overall, these data suggest that immune responses might be affected by different factors such as the 
underlying disease and type of IS therapy, but also by the timing to vaccination (before, during, after), 
and/or interval between vaccination and the IS therapy. The consequences on the short and long-term 
protection are unknown. 
Results of study ZOSTER-015 are mostly applicable for subjects stable on ART with CD4 ≥200 cells/mm3 
only. It is not known if the study results can be extrapolated to subjects with CD4 <200 cells/mm3 or 
without stable ART. 
Long term efficacy and persistence of immune responses as well as need and timing of additional doses is 
not established. The immunogenicity persistence results in IC-populations were lower compared to 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 166/173 
 
 
  
  
healthy subjects above 50 years of age. Antibody titre decreases between the different IC-patient-groups 
were heterogeneous in the four pivotal trials one year after the second dose. A long-term follow-up of VE 
is ongoing in immunocompetent subjects from the pivotal trials submitted at MAA. As subjects of these 
studies were vaccinated while immunocompetent, it will not be possible to extrapolate these results to IC 
patients. There is no plan to follow VE in IC subjects. A follow-up of a sub-group included in the study 
ZOSTER-041 is planned to assess long-term immunogenicity and anamnestic response after 
revaccination. 
The efficacy trial (ZOSTER-002) was performed with a flexible schedule, with the second vaccine dose 
being administered 1 to 2 months after the first dose, and a time of vaccination post-transplant of 50-70 
days. Because of the lack of CoP, it is not known if efficacy would be different when vaccination is 
performed with a fixed schedule and/or at another time respective to HCT. 
There is no immunogenicity data on co-administration with other vaccines in IC individuals of ≥18 YOA. In 
immunocompetent subjects, it was shown that Shingrix can be given concomitantly with unadjuvanted 
inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine, 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) or 
reduced antigen diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis vaccine (dTpa). It is not expected that this would 
be different in IC subjects. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Shingrix induces high transient local and systemic reactogenicity in adults ≥18 YOA who are 
immunocompromised (IC), reflecting a short-term inflammatory response induced by this adjuvanted 
vaccine. 
There was a high frequency of pain (83.9%) and grade 3 pain (11.0%) following HZ/su administration in 
ZOSTER-002 (79.5%-87.0% and 9.8%-11.0% of subjects in the 4 pivotal trials). Pain lasted for a median 
duration of 3.0 days across studies.  
In study ZOSTER-002, 75.2% of the subjects of the HZ/su group experienced solicited general symptoms, 
and 13.2% experienced grade 3 solicited general symptoms. The frequency was high in the control 
groups (50.9% and 6.0%) reflecting the underlying population. Similar frequencies were found across 
studies (68.7%-81.3% in the HZ/su group vs. 48.9%-66.4% in the Placebo group; 9.9%-22.3% in the 
HZ/su groups and 6.0%-15.5% in the Placebo groups). Myalgia, fever and shivering were strongly 
associated with HZ/su administration (two- to four-fold increased frequency compared to placebo 
subjects). Headache and fatigue were also increased with Shingrix. The frequency of fever (>37.5°C) 
ranged from 9.0% to 15.8% (12.1% in ZOSTER-002) per dose in the HZ/su group (<5.0% in the Placebo 
groups), depending on the studies. The median duration of solicited general symptoms was 3.0 days 
(maximal duration 7 days). 
Overall, the reactogenicity profile observed in IC patients ≥18 YOA seems consistent with the data for 
immunocompetent adults ≥50 YOA (ZOSTER-006).  
Reactogenicity is increasing with lowering age. Reactogenicity, both local and systemic, is higher in the 
18-49 YOA vs. ≥50 YOA IC individuals. Such age trend was also observed within the ≥50 YOA 
immunocompetent population when comparing subjects 50-69 YOA with subjects ≥70 YOA. 
Overall, no new safety signal has been confirmed. However, several safety findings that constitute 
potential new safety concerns need to be further documented in the PSURS. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/447929/2020 
Page 167/173 
 
 
  
  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Reactogencity is not known in individuals 18-49 YOA who are not IC (but may be ‘at-increased risk of 
HZ’). The available data are too limited to draw conclusions about reactogenicity in immunocompetent 
individuals 18-49 YOA, and about the magnitude of the age trend in immunocompetent individuals. 
As in immunocompetent individuals, this adjuvanted vaccine could trigger exacerbations of pre-existing 
potential Immune-Mediated Disease (pIMDs) in IC patients. Therefore, vaccination should be considered 
on an individual basis in this population for which limited data are available. At initial MAA, the safety 
concern: ‘Risk of pIMDs following Shingrix vaccination’ was classified as important potential risk 
(theoretical risk considered for all vaccines containing adjuvant systems). The data showed no confirmed 
safety signal for a new pIMD onset at MAA, and in the pharmocovigilance setting. The same conclusion 
applies for the present studies in IC. Imbalances were observed, but available data are limited, 
considering the incidence of these diseases. This risk of pIMDs is followed by active surveillance and 
addressed by two PASS. 
The important potential concern Virus reactivation in individuals with a history of Herpes Zoster is 
included in the safety concerns of the RMP based on an observation in a small study in subjects ≥50 YOA. 
A new study is ongoing in subjects ≥50 YOA to further evaluate this observation (ZOSTER-062).  
In patients at high-risk of such conditions, the data point to non-statistically significant imbalances in 
febrile neutropenia and pneumonia over the period up to 30 days post second vaccination (approximately 
two fold increased frequency in vaccinated vs. placebo). These events will be followed in the PSUR.  
There is no information on the use of Shingrix in VZV naïve individuals or individuals previously 
vaccinated against varicella. The SmPC reflects that Shingrix is not indicated for prevention of primary 
varicella infection. Vaccination of individuals previously vaccinated against varicella requires individual 
B/R assessment. 
A total of 1,587 Immunocompromised subjects received at least 1 dose of HZ/su (443 subjects 18-49 
YOA and 1,144 subjects ≥50 YOA). The safety database of IC patients is limited and the population of IC 
patients is extremely heterogeneous. Uncertainties thus remain with respect to the adverse events 
induced by vaccination in IC populations, and within subgroups of this population. 
There is limited safety data in patients with chronic diseases even if a substantial number of adults ≥50 
YOA with co-morbidities, the most frequently reported being COPD, type II diabetes mellitus, asthma, 
depression, respiratory disorders and renal disorders, were included in the pivotal studies ZOSTER-006 
and ZOSTER-022 submitted in the initial MAA.  
Subjects were followed up at least a year in the pivotal trials, and the median follow up period is 21 
months in the largest trial (ZOSTER-002). Long term safety is not established in the IC population. 
Safety and reactogenicity of booster dose(s) is not established in the IC population.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Shingrix clearly demonstrated efficacy in protecting adult autologous HCT patients against HZ, when 
vaccinated only 50-70 days after the transplant (68.17% [95% CI: 55.56% - 77.53%] over 21 months). 
Shingrix also reduced the incidence of PHN (VE of 89.27% [95% CI: 22.54% - 99.76%]) and other HZ 
related complications, as well as the severity and duration of pain. 
The immune responses tended to be different between the IC subpopulation studied between in the 
pivotal trials. Nonetheless, vaccine-induced humoral and cellular immune responses were demonstrated 
in the 5 studied IC populations, i.e. autologous HCT adult recipients, HIV infected adults, adults with solid 
tumors and receiving chemotherapy, adults with hematologic malignancies who were vaccinated during a 
cancer therapy course or after the full cancer therapy course, and renal transplant recipients. There is no 
established CoP for Shingrix, and the level of efficacy can therefore not be derived from the 
immunogenicity data generated in the other IC populations.  
It is considered that these data proof the ability of Shingrix to protect IC patients, in whom the burden of 
HZ is high. The magnitude of the protective effect might be lower in subgroups of this population, and 
may vary according to disease and in patients under immunossupressive (IS) therapies, according to the 
type and timing of the therapy. The level of efficacy in patients under concomitant IS therapy is not 
known.  
The duration of VE against HZ and PHN beyond 21 months is unknown in IC patients.  
As in immunocompetent adults ≥50 YOA, Shingrix induces high transient local and systemic reactogenicity 
in IC adults. Fever and severe reactogenicity were not uncommon. These adverse reactions do not last 
more than a few days. 
There is only very limited data from the early development of Shingrix for individuals 18-49 YOA who are 
not IC. 
Based on the data submitted at MAA, there was no identified risk. Shingrix has been largely used since 
first approval and no safety signal was confirmed based on the routine pharmacovigilance system (since 
13 October 2017, exposure to Shingrix is estimated to be between 5 818 118 and 11 636 236 subjects). 
No safety signal has been confirmed in the IC studies. However, febrile neutropenia and pneumonia need 
to be further monitored and discussed through the PSUR.As in immunocompetent individuals, this 
adjuvanted vaccine could trigger exacerbations of pre-existing pIMDs in IC patients. There is also a 
theoretical risk of triggering pIMDs, as for all vaccines containing adjuvant systems (important potential 
risk included in the RMP). 
Given the limited safety database and the heterogeneity of the IC population, important uncertainties 
remain with respect to the adverse events induced by vaccination in IC populations, and within subgroups 
of this population. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The efficacy data in patients with autologous HCT and/or hematologic malignancies, together with the 
evidence of robust immune responses in other IC populations, brought the proof that Shingrix is able to 
protect IC patients from HZ and PHN, as well as to reduce the burden and severity related to HZ in them. 
Altogether it is considered likely that Shingrix provides a benefit in adult patients with 
immunosuppressive conditions or therapies, in whom HZ may be particularly frequent and severe.

Uncertainties remain as to the level of efficacy according to the various diseases and according to the 
type and timing of the IS therapies. The main uncertainty is for patients under ongoing IS therapies. 
Uncertainties also remain about whether the efficacy is sustained over time. 
The population targeted by the proposed indication is broader than the population included in the 
submitted IC trials. Beside immunosuppression, many conditions and individual characteristics lead to an 
increased risk of HZ. Both the very high efficacy demonstrated in immunocompetent subjects ≥50 YOA 
(including patients with comorbidities), and the evidence of efficacy in patients with hematologic 
malignancies, provide high reassurance about the benefit of Shingrix in the indication. 
The reactogenicity profile of HZ/su in IC ≥18 YOA is similar to that in adult ≥50 YOA. There are very 
limited reactogenicity and safety data in individuals 18-49 YOA who are not IC. 
Based on the data submitted at MAA, there was no identified risk. Since first approval in October 2017, it 
is estimated that 6-12 million persons have been exposed to Shingrix and no safety signal was confirmed 
based on routine pharmacovigilance. No safety concern related to the use of Shingrix was identified in the 
IC populations. 
There is a theoretical risk of inducing pIMDs and to exacerbate pre-existing pIMDs, as with all vaccines 
containing adjuvant systems.  
It is considered that the benefit largely outweighs the unfavourable effects linked mainly to 
reactogenicity. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
None 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Shingrix in the applied indication is positive. The extension of indication can be 
recommended for approval.

As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated in order to delete a 
warning and to add new safety and efficacy information. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. 
The RMP version 2.2 has also been approved. 
In addition, the list of excipients has been updated in section 6 of the SmPC.   
Furthermore, the MAH took this opportunity to implement some editorial changes in Annex II and IIIA.  
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I, II, IIA and IIIB and to the 
Risk Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0222/2018 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
5.  EPAR changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In particular the EPAR module 
8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows:

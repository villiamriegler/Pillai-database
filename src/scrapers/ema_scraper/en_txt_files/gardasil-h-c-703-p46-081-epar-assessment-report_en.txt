V503 – 001: A Randomized, International, Double-Blinded (With In- House Blinding), Controlled With 
GARDASIL™, Dose-Ranging, Tolerability, Immunogenicity, and Efficacy Study of a Multivalent Human 
Papillomavirus (HPV) L1 Virus-Like Particle (VLP) Vaccine Administered to 16- to 26-Year-Old Women 
Description 
This was a randomized, double-blind (operating under in-house blinding procedures), controlled with 
qHPV vaccine, multicenter, multinational, dose-ranging, safety, immunogenicity and efficacy study with 
a target enrollment of 14,620 subjects. The study was enrolled in 2 parts. Approximately 1240 
subjects were to be enrolled in Part A and equally randomized to 3 dose formulations of 9vHPV vaccine 
or qHPV vaccine. One dose formulation was selected based on interim immunogenicity results. 
Approximately 13,380 subjects were to be enrolled in Part B and equally randomized to the selected 
dose formulation of 9vHPV vaccine or qHPV vaccine.

(EMEA/H/C/3852). Thus, the description of this study is copied from the AR for V503. 
Methods 
Primary Objectives 
1. 
 Objective: To evaluate the tolerability of the 9-valent HPV L1 VLP vaccine when administered 
to 16- to 26-year-old women. 
2.  Objective: To evaluate a formulation of 9-valent HPV L1 VLP vaccine for use in the efficacy 
evaluation in Part B. 
Study design 
Randomized, double-blind, controlled with qHPV vaccine, multicenter, multinational, dose-ranging, 
safety, immunogenicity and efficacy study. 
Study population /Sample size 
Females 16-26 years of age. Inclusion criteria included: in good physical health; able to read, 
understand, and complete the vaccination report card; agrees to provide study personnel with a 
primary telephone number as well as an alternate telephone number for follow-up purposes; has never 
had Pap testing or has only had normal Pap test results; has a lifetime history of 1 to 4 male and/or 
female sexual partners at the time of enrollment OR has 0 male and/or female sexual partner, is 18 
years of age or older, and plans to become sexually active within the first 3-6 months of the study; has 
refrained from douching/vaginal cleansing and using vaginal medications or preparations for 2 calendar 
days prior to the Day 1 visit and agrees to refrain from these activities for 2 calendar days prior to any 
future visit that includes collection of study specimens (cervical/genital swabs or Pap test); has 
refrained from sexual activity (including anal, vaginal, or genital/genital contact whether same sex or 
opposite sex) for 2 calendar days prior to the Day 1 visit. Subject agrees to refrain from these sexual 
activities for 2 calendar days prior to any future visit that includes collection of study specimens 
(cervical/genital swabs or Pap test); since the first day of the subject’s last menstrual period through 
Day 1, the subject has not had sex with males or has had sex with males and used effective 
contraception with no failures and understands and agrees that during the Day 1 through Month 7 
period, she should not have sexual intercourse with males without contraception.  
Treatments 
Study vaccine was administered as a 0.5-mL intramuscular injection in a three dose regimen (Day 1, 
Month 2, and Month 6). 
Part A: Approximately 1,240 healthy 16- to 26-year-old women were to be randomized in equal 
numbers to one of the three 9vHPV vaccine dose formulations (low, mid or high dose) or the 
comparator qHPV vaccine. 
Part B: Approximately 13,380 additional healthy 16- to 26-year-old women were to be randomized in 
equal numbers to the selected 9vHPV vaccine dose formulation chosen from Part A or the comparator 
qHPV vaccine.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy: The protocol specified that the primary analysis of efficacy was to be conducted in the per-
protocol efficacy (PPE) population. This cohort consisted of subjects who received all 3 vaccinations, 
did not deviate from the study protocol in ways that could potentially interfere with the efficacy of the 
vaccine, and were seronegative at baseline and PCR negative at baseline and during the 6-month 
vaccination regimen and for 1 month thereafter (to allow for induction of immune responses to Dose 3 
of the vaccine), to the relevant HPV type(s). Cases of the primary endpoint were counted starting after 
Month 7. The following specimens were collected from study participants for the purpose of detecting 
vaccine-type HPV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) or clinical disease: (1) cervicovaginal and external 
genital swabs; (2) ThinPrep™Pap test; (3) cervical or external genital biopsy if clinically indicated; (4) 
endocervical curettage specimen at the investigator’s discretion; and (5) definitive therapy specimen if 
clinically indicated.  
Immunogenicity: Serum anti-HPV 6, 11, 16, 18, 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 titers were measured using a 
HPV-9 competitive Luminex Immunoassay (HPV-9 cLIA). The following endpoints were collected from 
each study subject to assess immunogenicity: 1) cLIA titers for each of the vaccine HPV types; 2) 
seroconversion status (i.e., above or below serostatus cutoff) for each of the vaccine HPV types. All 
subjects that were part of the defined per protocol immunogenicity (PPI) population were included in 
the immunogenicity summary. Serum samples were collected from all subjects at Day 1 and Month 7. 
Additional samples were collected at Month 12, Month 24, Month 36, and Month 42 to assess 
persistence of antibody responses. The primary time point for immunogenicity analysis was at Month 
7.

Efficacy results 
HPV 31/33/45/52/58-Related Endpoints 
Table 11-1 presents the results of evaluation of efficacy against the primary efficacy endpoint of high 
grade cervical, vulvar, and vaginal disease related to HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 in the PPE 
population.  The cumulative incidence distribution of the primary efficacy endpoint in the PPE 
population is shown in Figure 11-1. 
Table 11-2 presents the results of evaluation of efficacy against the primary efficacy endpoint of high 
grade cervical, vulvar, and vaginal disease related to HPV types 31, 33, 45, 52, and 58 in the HNTS 
population.  
One of the secondary objectives was efficacy against HPV 31/33/45/52/58-Related Cervical, Vulvar, 
and Vaginal Disease, i.e the same as the primary objective, but also including low-grade disease. The 
efficacy against this composite endpoint was 97.1% (95% CI 91.9; 99.2).

The results for the exploratory objectives relating to HPV-31/33/45/52/58-related Pap test 
abnormalities and cervical and external genital procedures and cervical definitive therapy were in 
agreement with the above efficacy endpoints. The composite endpoint HPV 31/33/45/52/58 ASC-US 
HR-HPV positive or worse had a risk reduction of  in the PP population, and in the HNTS population. 
The risk reduction for HPV 31/33/45/52/58-related biopsy was 96.9% (95% CI 93.6, 98.6) in the PP 
population and .  
Assessor’s comment: The efficacy against the five new HPV types, (31/33/45/53/58) was 
demonstrated using a composite endpoint for all types and CIN 2/3, AIS, Cervical Cancer, 
VIN 2/3, VaIN 2/3, Vulvar Cancer, and Vaginal Cancer combined. The results are driven by 
HPV type, which was the most common type and CIN2, which was the most common lesion 
type. The conclusions regarding the primary objective is supported by related secondary 
objectives. Thus, taken together all data relating to the five new HPV types indicate that the 
9vHPV is effective in preventing disease related to these types.  
HPV 6/11/16/18-Related Endpoints  
It is expected that the 9vHPV vaccine is similarly efficacious in preventing persistent infection and 
disease related to these four HPV types as the qHPV. The comparison of the 9vHPV vaccine group with 
the qHPV vaccine group with respect to HPV 6/11/16/18-related endpoints is an assessment of 
similarity of the incidences of these endpoints in the two vaccine groups.  
Table 11-10 presents the results of comparison of the 9vHPV vaccine group with the qHPV vaccine 
group with respect to cervical, vulvar, and vaginal disease related to HPV types 6, 11, 16, and 18 in 
the PPE population.

Table 11-12. Impact of 9vHPV Vaccine on the Incidence of HPV 6/11/16/18-Related 
Persistent Infection (PPE and HN-TS Analysis Populations) 
Assessor’s comment: The number of cases of the clinical endpoints related to HPV6/11/16/18 in the PP 
population was low, as expected. In the qvHPV group 6 of the 7 cases were related to HPV16, and they 
were also co-infected with non-vaccine high-risk HPV types on or before the time of becoming a case 
of HPV16-related disease. The number of cases in the HNST population was higher, but the results 
were consistent with the PP population results. The results for persistent infections are also in 
agreement with the results for the primary endpoints, i.e. there are only small differences between the 
groups.  
Safety results 
Dose-Ranging Substudy: Administration of the 9vHPV vaccine was generally well tolerated. The 
frequencies of clinical adverse experiences were generally comparable among the three 9vHPV vaccine 
groups and the qHPV vaccine group. .

Efficacy Substudy:Administration of the 9vHPV vaccine was generally well tolerated. The frequencies of 
clinical adverse experiences were generally comparable among the 2 vaccination groups (9vHPV 
vaccine group and qHPV vaccine group). Frequency of injection-site adverse experiences was higher in 
the 9vHPV vaccine group than in the qHPV vaccine group. subjects discontinued from the study due to 
a vaccine-related adverse experience4 in the qHPV vaccine groupvaccine-related serious adverse 
experiences2 in the qHPV vaccine groupadverse experiences resulting in death5 in the qHPV vaccine 
group); none of these events were considered vaccine-related by the reporting investigator.

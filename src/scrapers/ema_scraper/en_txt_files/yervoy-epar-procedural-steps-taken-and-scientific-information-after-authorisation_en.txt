Currently available data of nivolumab monotherapy or 
nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab in paediatric 
subjects are described in sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC 
but no recommendation on a posology can be made. 
Only limited safety data of nivolumab as monotherapy or in 
combination with ipilimumab in children below 18 years of 
age are available. No new safety signals were observed in 
clinical study CA209908 of 151 paediatric patients with high 
grade primary central nervous system (CNS) malignancies, 
relative to data available in adult studies across indications. 
Results for OS, PFS, and ORR observed in study CA209908 
do not suggest clinically meaningful improvement over 
what is expected in these patient populations.

symptoms should be assessed for potential myocarditis. If 
myocarditis is suspected, prompt initiation of a high dose of 
steroids (prednisone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day or 
methylprednisolone 1 to 2 mg/kg/day) and prompt 
cardiology consultation with diagnostic workup according to 
current clinical guidelines should be initiated. Once a 
diagnosis of myocarditis is established, nivolumab or 
nivolumab in combination with ipilimumab should be 
withheld (grade 2 myocarditis) until symptoms resolve and 
management with corticosteroids is complete or 
permanently discontinued (grade 3 myocarditis).

Results from study CA184 169 showed that overall survival 
reflect the final results of study CA184-169, a 
randomized double-blind phase III study of 
ipilimumab administered at 3 mg/kg versus at 10 
mg/kg in subjects previously treated or untreated 
with unresectable or metastatic melanoma, in order 
to fulfil ANX 014.1. The MAH also provided with this 
variation application efficacy and safety data from 
study CA184-169 in two subgroups: female ≥ 50 
years of age and with brain metastases in order to 
fulfil MEA 015.1. Annex II.D and the RMP (version 
14.1) are updated accordingly. In addition the 
Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the 
opportunity to update the list of local representatives 
in the Package Leaflet, to include some editorial 
changes and correct some typos throughout the 
product information, and to bring the product 
information in line with the latest QRD template 
version 10.

compared between ipilimumab 10 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg 
and PL 
groups showed HR = 0.84 (95% CI: 0.70, 0.99; P-value = 
0.04). No statistically significant difference in progression 
free survival (PFS) was observed between the 10 mg/kg 
and the 3 mg/kg groups. (HR 0.89 with a 95% CI of 0.76, 
1.04 and log-rank test P-value = 0.1548). Best overall 
response rate was similar in the 10 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg 
groups. Best overall response rate in the 10 mg/kg group 
was 15.3% (95% CI: 11.8, 19.5) and in the 3 mg/kg group 
was 12.2% (95% CI: 9.0, 16.0). Ipilimumab 10 mg/kg was 
associated with higher rates of adverse events compared 
with the 3 mg/kg dose. The frequencies of serious adverse 
reactions in the 10 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg groups were 37% 
and 18%, with the 3 most common serious adverse 
reactions being diarrhea (10.7% vs 5.5%), colitis (8.0% vs 
3.0%), and hypophysitis (4.4% versus 1.9%). Adverse 
events leading to discontinuation in the 10 mg/kg and 3 
mg/kg groups occurred in 31% and 19% of patients, with 
adverse events (AEs) leading to death in 4 and 2 patients, 
respectively. At the recommended dose of 3 mg/kg median 
OS was similar in the subgroup of females ≥ 50 years of 
age compared to the overall population: (11.40 vs 11.53 
months). Median OS in the subgroup with brain metastases 
at baseline was 5.67 months at the recommended dose of 
3 mg/kg. In addition, patients with ocular melanoma were 
not included in the CA184-169 clinical trial. However, 
patients with brain metastases were included in this study, 
if they were free of neurologic symptoms related to 
metastatic brain lesions and if they did not require or 
receive systemic corticosteroid therapy in the 10 days prior 
to beginning ipilimumab therapy. The overall safety profile

Following a request from the PRAC as part of Yervoy 
(ipilimumab) PSUSA/00009200/201603, the MAH 
Page 22/37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conducted a review of clinical trials data, post-marketing 
data and the literature on the risk of sequential 
administration of Yervoy with vemurafenib. In a Phase 2 
trial, the sequential treatment with vemurafenib followed 
by 10 mg/kg ipilimumab in patients with BRAF-mutated 
metastatic melanoma showed a higher incidence of Grade 
3+ skin adverse reactions than with ipilimumab alone. 
Caution should be used when ipilimumab is administered 
following prior vemurafenib. In addition, based on a review 
of the MAH’s safety database, the frequency of the adverse 
drug reaction ‘Vogt-Konyanagi-Haranda syndrome’ is 
updated from ‘not known’ to ‘rare’. Finally regarding the 
grading criteria and numerical threshold criteria for 
withholding and discontinuation of ipilimumab, sections 4.2 
and 4.4 of the ipilimumab SmPC are aligned with the 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
version 4.0, a standard procedure for drug management. 
Update of section 4.4 to revise the current warning 
on concurrent administration with vemurafenib to 
enhance awareness on the potential of 
hypersensitivity reactions when ipilimumab is used 
sequentially with vemurafenib as requested by the 
PRAC following the assessment of 
PSUSA/00009200/201603. Update of sections 4.8 of 
the SmPC to amend the frequency of the adverse 
drug reaction ‘Vogt-Konyanagi-Haranda syndrome’ 
from ‘not known’ to ‘rare’. The Package Leaflet and 
RMP (version 16.1) have been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder 
(MAH) took the opportunity to implement some 
editorial changes to sections 4.2 and 4.4 of the 
SmPC to update the dose modification information 
for hepatotoxicity management guidelines in line 
with National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common 
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 
recommendations (version 4).

Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy,

the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
and PL 
Yervoy in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity. 
Based on a pooled analysis of long term OS data from 
clinical trials in patients with previously treated and 
treatment naïve advanced melanoma presented by the 
MAH, sections 5.1 of the SmPC was proposed to be

trimester through delivery, at exposure (AUC) levels either 
similar to or higher than those associated with the clinical 
dose of 3 mg/kg of ipilimumab. No treatment-related 
adverse effects on reproduction were detected during the 
first two trimesters of pregnancy. Beginning in the third 
trimester, both ipilimumab groups experienced higher 
incidences of abortion, stillbirth, premature delivery (with 
corresponding lower birth weight), and infant mortality 
relative to control animals; these findings were dose-
dependent. Additionally, developmental external or visceral 
abnormalities were identified in the urogenital system of 2 
infants exposed in utero to ipilimumab. One female infant 
had unilateral renal agenesis of the left kidney and ureter, 
and one male infant had an imperforate urethra with 
associated urinary obstruction and subcutaneous scrotal 
edema. The relationship of these malformations to 
treatment is unclear.

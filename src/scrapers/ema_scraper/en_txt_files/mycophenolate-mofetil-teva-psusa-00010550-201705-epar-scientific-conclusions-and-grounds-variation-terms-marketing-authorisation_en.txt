Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSURs for mycophenolate mofetil, 
mycophenolic acid, the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Following a review of all available information regarding pregnancies following paternal exposure to 
mycophenolate mofetil or mycophenolic acid, including a review of all non-clinical data and information on 
transmission of mycophenolic acid via the semen, the PRAC concluded that the data does not highlight 
any patterns or an increase in congenital malformations or spontaneous abortions. The PRAC therefore 
recommended to amend the product information, to update information on teratogenic effects and 
pregnancy as well as the contraception recommendations for male patients. Additional amendments have 
been made regarding use of contraception in women and pregnancy testing, to clarify the requirements. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisations 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for mycophenolate mofetil, mycophenolic acid, the CHMP is of 
the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal products containing mycophenolate mofetil, 
mycophenolic acid is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisations should be varied.

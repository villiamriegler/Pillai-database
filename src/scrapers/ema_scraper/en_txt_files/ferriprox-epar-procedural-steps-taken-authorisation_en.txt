On  30  April  1999  the  CPMP  was  made  aware  of  potentially  new  safety  information  on 
deferiprone, and in particular of the existence of a recent draft manuscript by Berdoukas et al, 
1999, indicating that there could be a risk of having progression of hepatic fibrosis, even over a 
short period of time. 
This issue was discussed at the CPMP Meeting on 18-20 May 1999. On behalf of the CPMP, 
the CPMP Chairman sent a letter to the European Commission on 20 May 1999, informing the 
European Commision accordingly. The applicant was also requested to supplement the file with 
any  additional  information  in  his  possession  or  to  confirm  that  all  currently  available 
information relevant to this issue had been supplied during the evaluation process.  
The applicant sent two letters dated 26 May 1999 and 1 June 1999 to the CPMP regarding the 
issue of liver fibrosis. 
On  11  June  1999  the  Rapporteur  and  Co-Rapporteur  circulated  reports  on  the  information 
provided. 
In a letter dated 15 June, 1999, the Commission informed the EMEA that the decision making 
process  had  been  suspended  and  requested  the  CPMP  to  clarify  whether,  in  the  light  of  the 
potentially  new  safety  information,  there  were  important  new  questions  of  a  scientific  or 
technical nature, which have not been addressed in the opinion of the Agency. 
The CPMP nominated relevant experts in the therapeutic area to participate in an ad-hoc expert 
group  meeting,  which  was  held  on  21  June  1999.  The  expert  group  forwarded  several 
recommendations to the CPMP. 
During the meeting on 22-23 June 1999 the CPMP accepted the recommendations of the ad-hoc 
expert group and, in the light of the overall data submitted and the scientific discussion within 
the Committee issued a revised positive Opinion for granting a Marketing Authorisation under 
exceptional circumstances to Ferriprox on 23 June 1999. 
The  CPMP  Opinions  were  forwarded,  in  all  official  languages  of  the  European  Union,  to  the 
European Commission, which adopted the corresponding Decisions on 25 August 1999.

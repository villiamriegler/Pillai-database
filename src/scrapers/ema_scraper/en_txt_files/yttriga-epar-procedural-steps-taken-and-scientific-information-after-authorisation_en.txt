SmPC, Annex II, 
Based on the review of the available information 
Labelling and PL 
the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, the 
safety and the efficacy of this medicinal product 
continues to be adequately and sufficiently 
demonstrated and considers that the benefit/risk 
profile of Yttriga continues to be favourable. The 
CHMP therefore recommended that a renewal 
can be granted with unlimited validity.   
With this procedure the MAH also updated the 
product information (PI) to align with the current 
QRD requirements.

I. 
INTRODUCTION 
On 14 May 2009 the MAH submitted one completed paediatric study for Invega (paliperidone) 
prolonged-release tablet, in accordance with Article 45 of the Regulation (EC)No 1901/2006, as 
amended on medicinal products for paediatric use. 
A short expert overview has also been provided. 
The  MAH  proposed  that  the  submitted  paediatric  study  does  not  influence  the  benefit  risk  for 
Invega and that there is no consequential regulatory action. 
II. 
SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
II.1 
Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the clinical study(ies) 
Paliperidone is a monoaminergic antagonist that exhibits the dopamine type 2 and predominant 
serotonin  antagonism  of  the  newer,  or  second-generation,  antipsychotic  drugs.  Paliperidone  is 
the major active metabolite of risperidone. Paliperidone Prolonged Release (PR) 1.5-mg, 3-mg, 
6-mg,  9-mg,  and  12-mg  tablets  are  approved  for  the  treatment  of  schizophrenia  in  adults.  The 
indication and some of the posology statements follow below: 
Invega is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia. 
Adults 
INVEGA  is  for  oral  administration.  The  recommended  dose  of  INVEGA  is  6  mg  once  daily, 
administered in the morning. The administration of INVEGA should be standardised in relation to 
food  intake.  The  patient  should  be  instructed  to  always  take  INVEGA  in  the  fasting  state  or 
always take it together with breakfast and not to alternate between administration in the fasting 
state  or  in  the  fed  state.  Initial  dose  titration  is  not  required.  Some  patients  may  benefit  from 
lower  or  higher  doses  within  the  recommended  range  of  3  to  12  mg  once  daily.  Dosage 
adjustment, if indicated, should occur only after clinical reassessment. When dose increases are 
indicated, increments of 3 mg/day are recommended and generally should occur at intervals of 
more than 5 days. 
Paediatric population 
Safety and efficacy of INVEGA in patients < 18 years of age have not been studied. There is no 
experience in children. 
The  Applicant  is  planning  to  seek  approval  under  European  Community  Regulation  1901/2006 
and  amendments  (“the  paediatric  regulation”)  for  the  use  of  paliperidone  PR  in  adolescents 
(12 to 17 years of age, inclusive) with schizophrenia on the basis of a clinical research program 
according  to  an  agreed  Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  (PIP,  EMEA-000014-PIP01-07).  The  PIP 
was adopted on 31 March 2008 and includes a waiver for the investigation of paliperidone PR 
tablets in children less than 12 years of age. 
The clinical research program consists of one Phase 1 study (PALIOROS-PSZ-1001) and three 
Phase 3 studies (R076477-PSZ-3001, R076477-PSZ-3002, and R076477-PSZ-3003) (Table 1).

Table 1: Summary of Paliperidone PR Pediatric and Adolescent Clinical Studies 
Study  PALIOROS-PSZ-1001,  a  Phase  1  PK  and  tolerability  study  in  25 subjects  aged  10  to 
17 years,  inclusive,  with  schizophrenia,  schizoaffective  disorder,  or  schizophreniform  disorder, 
has  been  completed.  The  study  included  3  dose  groups  (0.086,  0.129,  and  0.171  mg/kg/day), 
which  were  studied  in  a  sequential  ascending  design.  Paliperidone  PR  was  supplied  as  1-mg, 
3-mg, and 6-mg tablets. No paediatric formulation was used. 
The Phase 3 studies are ongoing or in planning (see Section II.3 for additional details). 
The data obtained from the 4 clinical studies above will provide information for inclusion in the 
SPC  concerning  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  paliperidone  in  the  paediatric  and  adolescent 
populations. 
Paliperidone  prolonged  release  (PR)  (European  Union)  and  extended  release  (ER)  (United 
States) may be used interchangeably in the remainder of this assessment report. 
II.2 
Non-clinical aspects 
The paliperidone PR Marketing Authorization Application for the treatment of schizophrenia in 
adults was submitted to the EMEA in May 2006. The MAH stated that this was supported by a 
full paliperidone nonclinical safety package. The nonclinical data included a full general toxicity 
package and a full reproduction toxicity package, but did not include a rat juvenile toxicity study 
conducted with paliperidone.  
In the repeat-dose general toxicity studies in rats (which continued up to 6 months), dosing with 
paliperidone started at the age of 4 weeks. At 4 weeks rats are in early puberty, based on the 
development of the male and female reproductive systems. Brain development is still ongoing in 
rats at that age.  
Thus, it appears that adolescent animals have been included in these studies although juvenile 
toxicity effects were not specifically addressed. A new pre- and postnatal development toxicity 
study with higher doses of paliperidone is part of the agreed PIP.

Clinical aspects 
1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a report for: 
-  PALIOROS-PSZ-1001: Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics 
of Single- and Multiple-Dose Extended-Release OROS Paliperidone in Pediatric Subjects 
(to Years of Age) with Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective Disorder, or Schizophreniform 
Disorder 
In addition, a post-marketing cumulative safety summary was submitted providing a review of 
post-marketing AEs reported to the MAH since the launch of the paliperidone PR tablets.

The MAH provided a brief description of the following three Phase 3 studies, which are ongoing 
or planned: 
-  R076477-PSZ-3001 (ongoing); 
-  R076477-PSZ-3002 (ongoing); 
-  R076477-PSZ-3003 (planned); 
The ongoing safety and efficacy study PSZ-3001 is a 6-week, randomized, double-blind, 
weight-based fixed dose, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multicentre study in approximately 
200 adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, inclusive, with schizophrenia. Subjects are randomly 
assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups (corresponding to non-overlapping milligram per kilogram 
groups) to explore the tolerated adult dose range (1.5-12 mg) of paliperidone PR in this 
population.  
The ongoing long-term safety study PSZ-3002 is a 2-year, open-label, multicentre study in which 
approximately 400 subjects will be enrolled in order to have at least 100 evaluable adolescent 
subjects 12 to 17 years of age, inclusive, with schizophrenia. Subjects are flexibly dosed with 
1.5 to 12 mg/day paliperidone PR.  
Study PSZ-3003 is planned to be a 26-week, randomized, double-blind, active-controlled 
efficacy and safety study of paliperidone PR for the treatment of schizophrenia in adolescents 
(aged 12-17 years, inclusive), with assessment of positive and negative symptoms of 
schizophrenia at 8 weeks and maintenance of effect at 26 weeks. 
2.  Clinical study(ies) 
PALIOROS-PSZ-1001 
Open-Label Study to Evaluate the Safety and Pharmacokinetics of Single- and Multiple-
Dose Extended-Release OROS Paliperidone in Pediatric Subjects (≥10 to ≤17 Years of 
Age) with Schizophrenia, Schizoaffective Disorder, or Schizophreniform Disorder 
  Description 
This was a multicenter, open-label study to evaluate the PK, safety, and tolerability of 
single- and multiple-dose paliperidone PR tablet administration in children and adolescent 
subjects, ≥10 to ≤17 years of age with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or 
schizophreniform disorder. 
  Methods 
  Objective(s) 
To characterize the pharmacokinetics of paliperidone after single-dose administration 
and at steady state following multiple oral administrations of paliperidone ER in children 
and adolescent subjects (≥10 to ≤17 years of age) with schizophrenia, schizoaffective 
disorder, or schizophreniform disorder. 
To evaluate the safety and tolerability of paliperidone PR in this subject population 
  Study design 
This was a multicenter, open-label study. The study included 3 dosage groups (0.086, 
0.129, and 0.171 mg/kg/day paliperidone PR), which were studied in a sequential 
ascending design. The dose groups approximated 6, 9, and 12 mg/day in adults. The 
maximum absolute dosage was not to exceed 12 mg/day.  
4
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For each dosage group, the study consisted of a screening phase; a 2-day single-dose 
PK and tolerability evaluation phase; a 7-day multiple-dose phase, with evaluation of PK 
and tolerability; and an end-of-study visit (upon completion or upon early withdrawal). 
For each subject, safety and tolerability were evaluated after single-dose treatment 
before continuing with multiple-dose treatment beginning on Day 3. An interim safety 
evaluation was conducted after completion of the first 4 subjects in the 0.086 mg/kg/day 
dosage group and after completion of all subjects in a dosage group. Following the 
completion of all subjects in each dosage group, safety and tolerability were evaluated in 
order to determine whether to proceed to the next higher dosage level.  
Within each dosage group, subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 PK blood sampling 
schemes (Schedule A or B) in a 1:1 ratio. Safety and tolerability were assessed at 
several points during the study. 
  Study population /Sample size 
The study enrolled children and adolescent subjects (≥10 to ≤17 years of age) with 
schizophrenia (of any subtype), schizoaffective disorder, or schizophreniform disorder 
according to DSM IV-TR and with Clinical Global Impression-Severity Scale (CGI-S) ≤3. 
Subjects were required to be healthy other than the DSM-IV-TR classification.  
Subjects who had taken any of the following medications were excluded: 
– Oral paliperidone or risperidone within 14 days before Day 1 
– Risperidone long-acting injectable (Risperdal CONSTA®) within 10 weeks before Day 1 
– Long-acting formulations of other neuroleptics within 1 treatment cycle before Day 1 
– Ziprasidone or thioridazine within 1 week before Day 1 
– Any hepatic enzyme inducer (e.g., rifampicin, carbamezepine, barbiturates, phenytoin, 
and St. John’s Wort) within 14 days before Day 1 
– Clozapine therapy within 6 weeks before Day 1 
– Any anticonvulsant medication within 14 days before Day 1 
– Daily use of aspirin or any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication 
The planned sample size was 24 subjects. The sample size was not chosen based on 
statistical considerations, but in order to limit the exposure in pediatric subjects while 
providing sufficient data to develop a population PK model. 
  Treatments 
The study included 3 dosage groups (approximately 0.086, 0.129, and 0.171 mg/kg/day 
of paliperidone PR, corresponding to daily doses of 6, 9, and 12 mg, respectively, for a 
70-kg adult on a milligram per kilogram basis) studied in a sequential ascending design. 
The dose was determined based on the dosage group and the subject’s body weight and 
was rounded to the nearest whole milligram. 
  Outcomes/endpoints 
PK parameters were estimated based on non-compartmental analysis. Safety was 
evaluated based on adverse events, clinical laboratory results, vital sign measurements, 
12-lead ECGs, and physical examination results, including Tanner Staging. Subjects 
were also monitored for extrapyramidal symptoms, using the Simpson and Angus Rating 
Scale (SAS), Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), and Abnormal Involuntary 
Movement Scale (AIMS). 
  Statistical Methods 
Descriptive statistics of the PK parameters were calculated for all completed subjects 
aged between 10–17 years (i.e., children and adolescents) and for subjects aged 
between 12–17 years (i.e., adolescents). Safety and tolerability data were tabulated and 
evaluated at the completion of the study using descriptive statistics.

  Results 
  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 25 subjects were enrolled (8, 9, and 8 in the respective dosage groups of 0.086, 
0.129, and 0.171 mg/kg/d paliperidone PR) and 24 subjects (8, 9, and 7 subjects in the 
respective dosage groups) completed the study. One subject in the high-dose group 
withdrew consent prior to dosing on Day 3.  
  Baseline data 
There were 18 males and 7 females. Body weight ranged from 31 to 89 kg.  There was a 
reasonable age distribution, with at least 6 completers in each stratum from 12 to 17 
years of age (i.e., 7 subjects aged 12 to 13, 6 subjects aged 14 to 15, and 10 subjects 
aged 16 to 17, as well as 1 subject aged 10). Overall, 56% of the subjects were white, 
24% were black, and 20% were Asian. Eight (32%) subjects had schizophreniform 
disorder, 7 (28%) had schizoaffective disorder, and 10 (40%) had schizophrenia.  
The total daily dose ranged from 4 mg to 12 mg/day. The number of subjects, weight, 
and total daily dose per age stratum are given in Table 2. The most common concomitant 
medications were olanzapine and quetiapine, which were taken by 8 subjects each. 
Table 2: Body weight and total daily dose per age stratum 
  Efficacy results  
This was an open label study and no efficacy results were obtained. Blood sampling for PK 
analyses was performed, though. Pharmacokinetics and tolerability were evaluated during both 
treatment phases. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 PK blood-sampling schemes in 
order to minimize blood sampling per subject. Frequent blood sampling was performed after the 
first dose of paliperidone (up to 36h), pre-dose samples were drawn during the multiple-dose 
phase and samples were drawn up to 24h after the last dose. 
Pharmacokinetic data were analyzed from 25 subjects for the single-dose treatment phase and 
24 subjects for the multiple-dose treatment phase. Plasma concentrations of the paliperidone 
enantiomers were determined using a validated liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass 
spectroscopy method with a target limit of quantification of 0.20 ng/mL and 1 ng/mL for plasma 
and urine, respectively. Descriptive statistics were calculated for the actual and dose-normalized 
(to 6 mg/d and 0.086 mg/kg/d) plasma and urine concentrations of paliperidone and its 
enantiomers at each sampling time, and for the derived estimated actual and dose-normalized 
6
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
plasma and urine steady-state PK parameters. Plasma and urine PK parameters at steady state 
(Day 9) were estimated for paliperidone and its enantiomers using noncompartmental analysis 
and were based on sparse blood sampling. 
Pharmacokinetic results are presented in Figure 1 and Table 3 below. For comparison, a table 
with PK results from adults has been included as Table 4.

Comments on PK results: 
After single-dose administration of paliperidone PR, the plasma concentrations of paliperidone 
reached peak plasma concentrations after approximately 24 hours. This was consistent with the 
release characteristics of paliperidone PR and the plasma concentration profile in adults. 
Steady-state drug concentrations were attained within 4 to 5 days of dosing, which was also 
consistent with observations in adults. Plasma exposure (Cmax and AUC) increased with 
increasing dose. 
Following multiple-dose administration, dose-normalized median Cmax was similar between 
adolescents and adults (Tables 3 and 4). Mean Cmax was somewhat higher in adolescents vs. 
adults. Median AUC24h of paliperidone in adolescents was higher, and median CL/F was lower 
than in adults. The ranges (min-max) of plasma exposure observed in paediatric and adolescent 
subjects were similar to adults. 
The applicant believes that differences in body weight may, at least partly, explain the 
differences in CL/F of paliperidone between adolescents and adult subjects. Figure 2 suggests 
that CL/F increased with increasing body weight in Study PSZ-1001. This observation is 
consistent with results from the population PK analysis of adult data, where paliperidone 
clearance was found to increase with increasing weight. According to Figure 3, there is no 
apparent relationship to the plasma exposure of paliperidone with age in the studied age range. 
It should be noted that the number of subjects in each age category is small and the range of 
exposures within each age category is wide.  
  The steady-state plasma (+)/(-) enantiomer ratio, accumulation ratio,fraction unbound (fu) 
and renal clearance of paliperidone in adolescent subjects were similar to values 
obtained in adults. The reported renal clearance values and amount of the dose excreted 
in urine were lower compared with the figures reported in the Invega adult MAA 
9
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(approximately 53 ml/min and 50-60%, respectively), which could be due to a urine 
sampling time of only 24 hours in this study. 
  Safety results 
All but 1 of the 25 subjects in the safety population received multiple dose administration 
of paliperidone. In total, 15 subjects (60%) experienced one or more treatment-emergent 
adverse events (AEs). The most common AEs were sedation (16%) and epistaxis (12%). 
Most events were reportedly mild or moderate in intensity. No serious AEs were reported 
and no subject discontinued from the study because of an AE. 
Five subjects (20%) reported extrapyramidal symptoms, which included extrapyramidal 
disorder (2), akathisia (1), dystonia (1), and tremor (1). A summary of treatment-
emergent AEs is provided in Table 5. 
Table 5: Treatment-emergent AEs by Body System or Organ Class (Safety Analysis 
Set) 
10
 
 
 
 
Overall, there was an increased incidence of AEs with dose.  
Regarding clinical laboratory results, mean increases for prolactin from screening to end-
of-study approximated 44 ng/mL, 31 ng/mL, and 52 ng/mL in the 0.086 mg/kg/day, 
0.129 mg/kg/day, and 0.171 mg/kg/day dosage groups. Changes from baseline ranged 
from -21.4 to 116.2 ng/mL. 
One subject (male, 17 years of age) in the 0.086 mg/kg/day dosage group had treatment-
emergent markedly abnormal values for alanine aminotransferase (ALT, up to 415 U/L), 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST, up to 192 U/L) and creatine kinase (up to 2890 U/L) at 
the end of the study. The values normalized at the follow-up visit 2 weeks later and were 
attributed to weight lifting. 
One subject in the 0.086 mg/kg dose group, 3 subjects in the 0.129 mg/kg dose group, 
and 3 subjects in the 0.171 mg/kg dose group experienced a prolonged value for QTcB, 
defined as ≥450 ms at any time point during the study (Table 6).  
No subject had an increase in QTcB or QTcF >60 ms from baseline. Two subjects (one in 
the 0.086 mg/kg dose group and one in the 0.129 mg/kg dose group) experienced in 
QTcF>30 ms from baseline. 
Table 6: Individual QTcB abnormalities 
3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The safety profile of paliperidone based on the limited data from this Phase 1 study 
appeared to resemble that observed in adults. The results from the Phase 3 studies 
should provide a more comprehensive data set to evaluate safety, including clinical 
laboratory changes and cardiac safety. 
The MAH also submitted a post-marketing evaluation of AEs reported in paediatric and 
adolescent subjects taking paliperidone PR. A search was conducted of the Benefit Risk 
Management worldwide safety database to identify all cases involving patients receiving 
paliperidone reported to the Sponsor cumulatively through 31 October 2008. Based on 
the 439,910.7 grams of paliperidone sold or distributed (from launch to 31 October 2008) 
the estimated exposure is 2,443,948 person-months. A breakdown of exposure in the 
paediatric and adolescent population is not available.  
The search retrieved a total of 1768 cases associated with paliperidone. Of these, a total 
of 72 cases involved paediatric and adolescent patients (age <18 years old), including a 
total of 131 adverse events. Twenty-eight of the 72 cases were considered serious. None 
had a fatal outcome. The 44 remaining cases were considered non-serious. Fifty-five 
cases were medically confirmed by a health care professional while 17 cases were not 
11
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
medically confirmed. Paediatric and adolescent patients who experienced adverse 
events associated with paliperidone ranged in age from neonate to 17 years old. Events 
reported more than once are presented in Table 7. 
Table 7: Adverse events reported in paediatric and adolescent cases up to 31 Oct 
2008 
Overall, the limited data available to date indicate a similar adverse event profile in 
adolescent patients compared with adults. However, this can only be evaluated more 
fully once the results from the larger studies become available.  
RAPPORTEUR’S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION 
  Overall conclusion 
The pharmacokinetic data indicated a similar PK profile of paliperidone PR in adolescents as in 
adults, with maximum plasma levels reached after approximately 24 hours and steady state 
reached after 4-5 days. A comparison with historical data in adults indicate a lower CL/F and 
higher exposure (Cmax and AUC0-24h) in adolescents compared with adults. The applicant´s 
proposed explanation for this finding is a lower weight in adolescents vs. adults. 
Doses from 4 to 12 mg paliperidone PR (corresponding to weight-adjusted doses ranging 
between 0.086 and 0.171 mg/kg) were fairly well tolerated. No serious adverse events occurred. 
  Recommendation 
It is recommended to evaluate Phase 3 study results in adolescents prior to updating the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. No regulatory action is required at this time. 
  Fulfilled –  
No further action required.

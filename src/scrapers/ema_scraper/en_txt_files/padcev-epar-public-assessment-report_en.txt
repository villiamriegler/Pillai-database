2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applicant applies for the therapeutic use of Padcev (enfortumab vedotin) for the treatment of adult 
patients with locally advanced (LA) or metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC) who have received a 
programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor and who have 
received a platinum-containing chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant, locally advanced or 
metastatic setting. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors  
Urothelial Cancer (UC) is an aggressive malignancy that kills more than 212000 patients annually 
(Bladder Globocan Factsheet, 2020). UC that originates in the bladder accounts for 90% of all UC 
cases, while the remaining originates in other parts of the urinary tract (Hepp et al, 2020; Miyazaki & 
Nishiyama, 2017). The UC is the 10th most common cancer worldwide, with more than 570000 new 
cases in 2020 (Bladder Globocan Factsheet, 2020; Hepp et al, 2020; Rouprêt et al, 2015). 
Approximately 203000 new cases of bladder cancer were diagnosed in 2020 in Europe, with 
approximately 67000 deaths (Bladder Globocan Factsheet, 2020).  
Bladder Cancer epidemiology shows a clear male predominance, and incidence and mortality rates 
differ per European country, probably due to differences in risk factors, detection, and availability of 
treatments. Tobacco smoking intensity is the most well-established risk factor for and directly related 
to BC, causing 50–65% of male cases and 20–30% of female cases (EAU Guideline invasive metastatic 
bladder cancer, 2020). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features  
Enfortumab vedotin targets Nectin-4,a type I transmembrane protein found to be highly expressed in a 
number of epithelial cancers, including, but not limited to, urothelial, lung, ovarian, head and neck, 
breast and pancreatic cancer specimens (Challita-Eid et al, 2016). In normal tissue, Nectin-4 
expression goes from moderate to weak and is mainly found in the epithelium of the bladder, skin, 
salivary gland ducts, gastrointestinal tract and breast ducts.  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis  
UC is a progressive disease with a subset of patients presenting with, or progressing to, locally 
advanced or metastatic UC. Untreated metastatic UC is associated with a median survival time rarely 
exceeding 3 to 6 months (Bellmunt et al, 2012). Among patients treated with a cisplatin-containing 
regimen as the first-line treatment, the median OS is approximately 12 to 14 months and the 5-year 
mortality rate exceeds 85% (von der Maase et al, 2005). Locally advanced or metastatic UC is an 
incurable disease with poor long-term survival and represents a high unmet medical need. 
UC presents the highest recurrence rate among solid tumours and is the second leading cause of death 
in genitourinary cancers. Despite recent advances in the understanding of the pathophysiology of the 
disease, the management of UC patients remains a clinically challenging problem (Siegel et al. 2014). 
Assessment report  
EMA/249357/2022 
Page 9/188 
 
 
 
 
Approximately 10%-15% of patients present with metastatic UC at the time of diagnosis. Despite the 
low frequency of de novo disease, approximately half of the patients with locally advanced UC progress 
to metastatic disease within two years of cystectomy. 
The most common presenting symptom is painless haematuria, seen in >80% of patients. Others may 
also present with irritative symptoms such as dysuria, frequency or urgency. Symptoms of metastases 
such as bone or flank pain are rare. (ESMO guideline for bladder cancer, 2014). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Standard first-line treatment for fit patients with a good renal function is cisplatin-based combination 
chemotherapy. Most used regimens are GemCis or methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin and cisplatin 
(MVAC) or dose-dense MVAC demonstrating median OS of 12–14 months (EAU guideline for muscle-
invasive and metastatic bladder cancer 2020). Cisplatin unfit is defined by at least one of the following 
criteria: PS > 1, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) ≤60 ml/min, grade ≥ 2 audiometric loss, peripheral 
neuropathy, and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III heart failure, which comprises over 50% 
of patients with BC. Gemcitabine and carboplatin (GemCarbo) have long been the standard systemic 
treatment for cisplatin-unfit patients based on a phase 2/3 RCT by the EORTC where GemCarbo was 
more effective (overall response rate (ORR) 42% vs 30%) with less toxicity than methotrexate/ 
carboplatin/vinblastine. Pembrolizumab and atezolizumab are approved by the FDA and European 
Medicines Agency for first-line treatment in cisplatin-ineligible patients, but only for those whose 
tumours express PD-L1. 
The only chemotherapy drug approved as second-line treatment in Europe was vinflunine. The 
approval was based on a phase 3 RCT, showing an ORR of 8.6% and a favourable safety profile.  
Statistically significant was found in the per-protocol patient population but not in the intention-to-
treat (ITT) population). Another strategy is represented by the rechallenge of former cisplatin-sensitive 
patients if progression occurred at least 6–12 months after first-line cisplatin-based combination 
chemotherapy. Currently, vinflunine is reserved for patients with contraindications to immunotherapy 
or as third- or later-line treatment. 
Most recently, second-line immunotherapy with PD-1/ PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors has been established 
and is still being studied as standard second-line therapy. Pembrolizumab, nivolumab, atezolizumab, 
avelumab, and durvalumab have demonstrated similar efficacy and safety in second-line phase 1–3 
trials. A phase 3 RCT with pembrolizumab, a PD-1 inhibitor, showed significant OS benefit over 
chemotherapy (paclitaxel, docetaxel, or vinflunine, 10.3 vs 7.4 mo, HR: 0.73; 95% CI: 0.59–0.91), 
leading to approval. The benefit was independent of PD-L1 expression levels, but consistent with 
longer follow-up. 
There is no consensus for the treatment of patient relapsing or refractory to second-line therapy 
Options include chemotherapy, immunotherapy, clinical trial or best supportive care according to EAU 
guideline. ESMO eUpdate published in December 2019 recommends Enfortumab vedotin in patients 
with platinum- and CPI-refractory urothelial carcinoma (III, B) or after ChT in patients who are 
ineligible for CPIs.No treatment options are currently approved in the third-line setting for patients with 
metastatic urothelial cancer after failure of platinum-based and PD-1/PD-L1 therapies. While taxanes 
or vinflunine can be used, historically only approximately 10% of patients respond after platinum-
based chemotherapy, irrespective of whether they have received prior PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, and the 
poor outcomes with taxane chemotherapy highlight the importance of developing more effective 
therapies for patients with advanced urothelial cancer (Keytruda SmPC, 2020; Drakaki et al, 2018; 
Powles et al, 2018). Thus, there is a significant unmet medical need, which is further underscored by

the limitations of current standard of care in frail or elderly patients who are not eligible for the 
currently available intervention strategies. 
About the product 
Enfortumab vedotin, is a fully humanized anti-Nectin-4 immunoglobulin G1 kappa monoclonal antibody 
(mAb) conjugated to the small molecule microtubule-disrupting agent monomethyl auristatin E 
(MMAE), via a protease-cleavable maleimidocaproyl valine-cituline (vc) linker. Enfortumab vedotin 
targets the Nectin-4 adhesion protein expressed in multiple cancers including urothelial, breast, lung, 
pancreatic and ovarian cancers. Enfortumab vedotin induces cytotoxicity in cancer cells by binding to 
the Nectin-4 target on the cell surface and forming an ADC-Nectin-4 complex. 
This complex is internalized and traffics to lysosomes where MMAE is released by proteolytic cleavage 
of the vc-linker. Intracellular release of MMAE subsequently disrupts tubulin polymerization resulting in 
G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. MMAE released from enfortumab vedotin targeted cells can 
diffuse into nearby Nectin-4 low-expressing cells resulting in cytotoxic cell death. 
The applicant claimed the indication of treatment of adult patients with locally advanced (LA) or 
metastatic urothelial cancer (mUC) who have received a programmed death receptor-1 (PD-1) or 
programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitor and who have received a platinum-containing 
chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant, locally advanced or metastatic setting. 
The approved indication is as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic urothelial cancer who have previously received a platinum-containing chemotherapy and a 
programmed death receptor-1 or programmed death-ligand 1 inhibitor. 
The SmPC specifies that treatment with Padcev should be initiated and supervised by a physician 
experienced in the use of anti-cancer therapies. 
The recommended dose of enfortumab vedotin is 1.25 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 125 mg for 
patients ≥100 kg) administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes on Days 1, 8 and 15 of a 
28-day cycle until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.  
The FDA has approved Padcev in the same indication as the current application in December 2019 
under accelerated approval based on tumor response rate from the phase II study EV-201. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on positive results from a randomised 
phase III study (EV-301) and supportive evidence from a single arm trial (EV-201). Hence, it was 
considered that the product addresses a high unmet need and will most likely impact medical practice. 
However, during assessment the CHMP concluded that it was no longer appropriate to pursue 
accelerated assessment, as further data and analysis were needed which was not compatible with the 
time frame of an accelerated timetable.

2.2.2.  Active Substance (AGS-22C3 monoclonal antibody intermediate 
General Information 
The active substance, enfortumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting Nectin-4, an 
adhesion protein that is highly expressed in urothelial cancer, a common and aggressive malignancy. 
Enfortumab vedotin is comprised of a fully human anti-Nectin-4 immunoglobulin G1 kappa monoclonal 
antibody  conjugated  to  the  small  molecule  microtubule-disrupting  agent  monomethyl  auristatin  E 
(MMAE), via a protease-cleavable maleimidocaproyl valine-citrulline (vc) linker. The AGS-22C3 antibody 
(mAb) intermediate is a fully human  IgG1, kappa subclass monoclonal antibody selectively binding to 
the nectin-4 extracellular domain on the surface of target cells.   
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls  
Satisfactory  documentation  of  GMP  has  been  provided  by  the  mAb  intermediate  manufacturing  and 
testing sites. 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process and controls for the mAb intermediate is considered appropriately 
detailed and controlled by in-process tests with appropriate action limits or acceptance criteria. Batch 
and scale definition is provided.  
The mAb intermediate is manufactured according to a fed batch mode culture. A subculture is initiated 
by thawing and inoculating cells from a working cell bank (WCB) vial into cell growth medium, and cell 
expansion is continued through several passages and used to inoculate the production bioreactor.  The 
production  culture  is  run  in  a  fed-batch  culture  mode  with  nutrient  feeds  during  the  cultivation.  The 
expressed antibody is separated from cells via filtration. The downstream purification process consists 
of  three  chromatography  steps,  two  viral  inactivation/removal  steps  and  an  ultrafiltration/diafiltration 
step before final conditioning. 
Control of materials 
Compendial and non-compendial raw materials are listed. For non-compendial materials, suitable test 
methods and specifications are provided. Filters and disposable containers used in cell culture process 
are  listed.  There  are  no  raw  materials  directly  derived  from  animals  or  humans  used  in  the  mAb 
intermediate manufacturing process other than the production cell line of Chinese hamster ovary origin. 
A  two-tiered  cell  banking  system  including  Master  Cell  Bank  (MCB)  and  Working  Cell  Bank  (WCB)  is

established.  Regarding  the  absence  of  adventitious  agents,  the  testing  panel  is  in  accordance  with 
ICHQ5A. In the event that generation of new WCBs is required in the future, relevant preparation and 
qualification procedures are described.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Steps with CPPs and/or critical in-process controls (IPCs) are considered the critical steps. Critical steps 
with CPPs impacting critical quality attributes (CQAs) are defined. For these steps, CPPs with their proven 
acceptable ranges (PARs) and IPCs with acceptance criteria are provided. Exceeding acceptance criteria 
for critical in-process controls will lead to batch rejection. 
Process validation 
The  applicant´s  lifecycle  of  the  process  validation  consists  of  three  stages:  Process  Design,  Process 
qualification and Continued process verification. The actual process validation data are obtained during 
process qualification. The performance parameter results obtained during process validation demonstrate 
that  the  cell  culture  and  purification  processes  are  under  control  and  can  be  considered  successfully 
validated. A qualification study was conducted to demonstrate the process-related impurity clearance. 
Overall  the  manufacturing  process  is  capable  to  achieved  sufficient  impurity  clearance.  In-process 
manufacturing  hold  times  were  established  during  development  of  the  commercial  process.  Resin 
lifetimes of chromatography steps were established by characterization studies. Resin reuse validation 
studies are on-going under a validation protocol. Batch uniformity was assessed and confirmed. A brief 
summary of shipment qualification is provided. 
Manufacturing process development 
Three manufacturing processes have been established for AGS-22C3 monoclonal antibody intermediate 
referred  to  as  Hybridoma  Process,  Process  A,  and  Process  B  (proposed  commercial).  Respective 
comparability exercises have been conducted. A comparability exercise was conducted to evaluate the 
similarity  of  mAb  intermediate  manufactured  by  Process  A  and  Process  B.  The  study  includes  release 
testing, extended characterisation and forced degradation. Overall the material manufactured by Process 
B is considered comparable with those manufactured by Process A.  
A  full  process  characterization  was  performed  specifically  for  mAb  intermediate.  The  overall  control 
strategy  of  the  mAb  intermediate  manufacturing  is  derived  from  current  product  and  process 
understanding and is further addressed in subsequent sections. 
The absence of extractable/leachable study performed with the material used for Material of Closure and 
Material of Closure liner should be completed as a future recommendation (REC). 
Characterisation 
The comprehensive characterisation studies provided for the mAb intermediate included analyses of 
the primary and higher order structures, glycoform structure, purity and impurities, binding properties, 
and biological activity. The materials used in characterisation studies are three mAb Intermediate 
batches manufactured by Process B. The batches 0316090/Z and 0416100/Z are two non-GMP batches 
manufactured at the beginning of the Process B from MCB. The mAb intermediate is a fully human 
IgG1 subclass monoclonal antibody directed against the extracellular V domain of Nectin-4. A single

consensus N-glycosylation site is located at heavy chain Asn297 and is occupied by glycans typical of 
those observed in CHO-derived IgG1 antibodies.  Multiple, partially orthogonal methods were employed 
to investigate physico-chemical characteristics of the mAb intermediate. CE-SDS was used to assess 
the size distribution of mAb under denaturing conditions. Intact mAb is composed primarily of 
covalently associated monomer. The size distribution of mAb under native conditions was assessed by 
SEC and detected primarily antibody monomer. The pI of the most abundant form of mAb was 
established. mAb charge variants were characterized. Charge variants had similar binding activity as 
assessed by competitive binding ELISA. Fab-and Fc—mediated properties were investigated. Although 
the Mab intermediate is capable to mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and 
antibody dependent cellular phagocytosis (ADCP) both activities are not considered to significantly 
contribute to the mechanism of action (MoA) of the ADC. The mAb intermediate did not promote 
cellular dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) activity. 
Control of mAb intermediate 
Specifications  and  acceptance  criteria  set  for  the  AGS-22C3  monoclonal  antibody  intermediate  are 
sufficient. The AGS-22C3 mAb intermediate specification include methods to evaluate appearance, pH, 
osmolality, identity, purity, protein concentration, potency, microbiology and glycosylation. 
Sufficiently  detailed  descriptions  of  analytical  methods  are  provided  by  the  applicant.  Methods  are 
performed in compliance with the European Pharmacopoeia. Non-compendial analytical procedures have 
been  validated  according  to  ICHQ2A  requirements.  Compendial  methods  have  been  verified.  Results 
indicate that the methods are suitable for release purposes.  
All batch analysis data of AGS-22C3 monoclonal antibody intermediate are provided. All results are within 
the  specification  criteria  at  time  of  release  and  confirm  that  mAb  intermediate  can  be  manufactured 
consistently. Specifications for the AGS-22C3 monoclonal antibody intermediate have been established 
based on principles outlined in ICH Q6B. It is noted that at the current stage the mAb is an intermediate 
and therefore the specifications and acceptance criteria are sufficiently justified for forward processing. 
Reference material 
Product  quality  results  for  the  commercial  reference  standard    are  provided  and  extended 
characterization  of  the  material  has  been  conducted.  Comparability  with historical  reference  standard 
material is established. Future reference standards will be prepared and fully qualified according to an 
established  protocol.  The  acceptance  criteria  for  stability  (retest)  and  future  reference  standards 
establishment will be updated to reflect contemporary mAb intermediate and AS specifications.  
Container closure system 
AGS-22C3 monoclonal antibody intermediate (mAb intermediate) is stored in a 4 L bottle. Stability data 
support that the container closure system for the mAb intermediate is suitable for storage. The choice 
of  the  container  closure  system  was  justified  and  the  container  components  are  in  line  with  current 
pharmaceutical standards for biopharmaceutical manufacturing. A recommendation is made to perform 
an extractables/leachable study for the product contact material. 
Stability 
The stability of AGS-22C3 mAb intermediate has been evaluated for multiple mAb intermediate batches. 
A  shelf  life  of  42  months  at  the  recommended  storage  condition  (≤  –60°C)  for  mAb  intermediate  is 
acceptable based on the real time data obtained for the primary stability batches.

2.2.3.  Active Substance 
General Information 
SGD-1006  is  Maleimidolcaproyl-valine-citrulline-paminobenzyloxycarbonyl-monomethyl  auristatin  E 
(vcMMAE).  SGD-1006  contains  12  stereogenic  centers.  SGD-1006  is  a  synthetic  small  molecule 
manufactured under GMP conditions for use as the drug-linker intermediate for further processing into 
vedotin-containing antibody drug conjugates (ADCs). 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Satisfactory GMP documentation from the druglinker manufacturing site has been provided. 
The manufacturing process of SGD-1006 is organized into six stages and ten synthetic steps. Each stage 
results in an isolated intermediate that is in tested according to the specifications. The individual steps 
are described in sufficient detail including the used materials and their quantities 
Control of materials: Six starting materials are identified for the synthesis of SGD-1006. Materials are 
tested according to approved specifications and are purchased from qualified suppliers. Information on 
fate and origin of impurities is provided. Appropriate controls and limits for such impurities are defined.  
An appropriate control strategy is proposed for relevant critical process parameters. 
Process  validation:  The  SGD-1006  intermediate  is manufactured  under  non-sterile  conditions  and  the 
manufacturing process has been satisfactorily validated, including shipping validation results. 
Identification  of  SGD-1006  critical  quality  attributes  (CQAs)  has  included  consideration  of  SGD-1006 
input material variability and manufacturing process capability. The classification of CQA and non-critical 
attributes  is  appropriately  justified  and  is  further  discussed  in  the  subsequent  sections.  A  risk-based 
approach  was  used  to  evaluate  the  performance  of  the  SGD-1006  manufacturing  process.  Certain 
process  parameters  in  each  stage  were  identified  as  potentially  critical  (CPPs)  and  were  subjected  to 
further  reaction  characterization  studies  prior  to  process  validation.  This  strategy  used  criticality 
assessments  to  inform  process  characterization  studies,  including  both  univariate  and  multifactorial 
studies such as Design of Experiments (DOE). The data were used to support the commercial SGD-1006 
process control strategy and to identify critical process parameters whose variabilities have a significant 
impact on SGD-1006 CQAs. Just a few parameters were found to impact the critical quality attributes. 
Appropriate controls are in place at these stages. 
Characterisation: Structural characterization of the SGD-1006 has been performed utilizing several 
analytical techniques. The identification, characterization, origin, and control strategy for potential 
impurities related to the manufacturing process are described. Impurity analysis data confirm that no 
or only very low quantities of related compounds may remain SGC-1006. Inorganic impurities are 
identified and listed. In general, the detected amounts are considered low and not posing a risk to 
patient safety. SGD-1006 is further processed by conjugation to form ADCs.  
Specification 
Control of AS (drug linker intermediate) 
Specifications and limits set for SGD-1006 intermediate are considered acceptable and ensure 
sufficient purity. The acceptance criteria defined for residual solvents are in accordance with ICH Q3C, 
no class 1 solvents are used in the manufacture of SGD-1006. Non-compendial methods have been 
validated and the results indicate that the methods are fit for purpose. Pharmacopeial methods have 
been qualified/verified for their suitability and intended purpose.

The control strategy for SGD-1006 specifications include analytical specifications of starting materials, 
reagents,  solvents,  and  intermediates,  in-process  analytical  tests  and  acceptance  criteria  and  also 
considers  further  SGD-1006  processing  to  the  ADC  active  substance.  Overall,  the  specifications  and 
defined limits for SGD-1006 are considered adequately justified. 
Reference material  
Qualification  results  of  the  current  reference  material  is  provided.  Upon  completion  of  the  initial 
qualification of a reference standard, to which a purity factor is assigned, subsequent re-qualification is 
performed at established regular intervals. 
Container closure system 
SGD-1006 is packaged in USP Type III soda-lime amber glass jars closed with a polytetrafluoroethylene 
(PTFE on product contact side) lined polypropylene screw cap. 
Stability 
Thirty-six months primary stability data are presented for six batches of SGD-1006 manufactured on a 
production-scale representing the commercial synthetic process throughout the manufacturing history. 
Data for more batches are available. The results of stability studies demonstrate the chemical stability 
of SGD-1006 when stored for up to 36 months at -20 °C/Ambient RH (recommended condition). 
2.2.4.  Active Substance (enfortumab vedotin) 
General Information 
The  enfortumab  vedotin  active  substance  (AS)  consists  of  fully  human  IgG1  mAb  intermediate,  AGS-
22C3,  conjugated  to  the  drug-linker  (DL)  intermediate  of  SGD-1006  (microtubule-disrupting  agent 
Monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE)) via thioether bonds, forming an ADC. The ADC has an average molar 
drug  to  antibody  ratio  (DAR)  of  approximately  four  drug  molecules  per  antibody,  resulting  in  a 
heterogeneous mixture of active conjugated isoforms. Binding of the ADC to Nectin-4-expressing tumor 
cells is followed by internalization of the ADC-Nectin-4 complex, and the release of MMAE via proteolytic 
cleavage. Release of MMAE disrupts the microtubule network within the cell, subsequently inducing cell 
cycle arrest and apoptosis of the cells 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Satisfactory GMP documentation has been provided by the manufacturer of the Enfortumab vedotin 
active substance (AS).  
Enfortumab vedotin active substance (AS) manufacturing is initiated by the thawing, pooling, filtering, 
and pH-adjusting of AGS-22C3 monoclonal antibody intermediate. Tris (2-carboxyethyl) phosphine 
(TCEP) is used to partially reduce the interchain disulfide bonds of the mAb intermediateSGD-1006 
drug-linker intermediate (DL intermediate) is then added in excess to react with the mAb intermediate 
thiols and form the covalently-bonded antibody-drug conjugate.. This quenched conjugation reaction 
solution is concentrated and then purified and exchanged into the base buffer for formulation. The 
diafiltered solution is then formulated, filtered, filled into bottles, and frozen.  
Process parameters and in-process controls were defined and respectively controlled within appropriate 
ranges and by action limits. Critical process parameters and in-process controls have been defined. 
The microbial control strategy is deemed acceptable considering the limits set for enfortumab vedotin 
active substance.

Control of materials 
Materials used in the manufacture of enfortumab vedotin AS are sourced from approved vendors, and 
are received and tested according to material specifications. The specifications for compendial materials 
are  based  on  the  relevant  monographs.  No  animal-derived  materials  are  directly  used  in  the  AS 
manufacturing process other than the mAb intermediate. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Manufacturing steps having a significant impact on CQAs or have essential roles in controlling CQAs are 
controlled. Steps with CPPs and/or critical IPCs are considered the critical steps.  
Process validation 
The enfortumab vedotin AS process validation strategy was designed to demonstrate that the commercial 
process is capable of consistently delivering AS with the required product quality. The lifecycle of the 
process validation consists of three stages: Process design, process qualification, and continued process 
verification. This approach is acceptable and in line with the European “Guideline on process validation 
for the manufacture of biotechnology-derived active substances and data to be provided in the regulatory 
submission”. Process verification was executed with three consecutive manufacturing batches that were 
manufactured under process validation protocols and in the commercial manufacturing facility and at the 
commercial  scale  to  demonstrate  process  consistency  in  commercial  manufacturing.  The  process 
performance  parameter  results  obtained  during  process  qualification  demonstrate  that  the  AS 
manufacturing  process  consistently  meets  criteria  for  process  performance  and  product  quality 
specifications for AS.  
Manufacturing process development 
Three  manufacturing  processes  have  been  established  for  enfortumab  vedotin  active  substance 
manufacturing,  referred  to  as  Hybridoma  Process,  Process  A,  and  Process  B  (proposed  commercial). 
Overall  the  comparability  exercise  performed  head-to-head  between  Hybridoma  Process  to  Process  A 
derived  material  indicates  sufficient  comparability  and  a  better  impurity  profile.  The  comparability 
exercise between Process A and B derived material executed side-by-side using release and extended 
characterization assays show that Process B batches can be considered similar to Process A batches for 
all quality attributes assessed in the study. This is supported by forced degradation studies showing that 
degradation modes of Process B were similar to Process A.  
Complete  comparability  studies  were  performed  between  Hybridoma  Process/Process  A  and  between 
Process  A/Process  B.  The  comparability  study  between  Process  B  batches is  considered  sufficient  The 
integrated  strategy  for  control  of  product  quality  of  SGD-1006  drug-linker  intermediate  (DL 
intermediate),  AGS-22C3  Monoclonal  antibody  intermediate  (mAb  intermediate),  enfortumab  vedotin 
active  substance  and  FP  was  developed  by  assessing  the  criticality  of  product  quality  attributes  and 
evaluating manufacturing process impact to each CQA. The outcome of the enfortumab vedotin AS CQA 
risk  assessment  is  considered  adequate.  Process  characterization  studies  provided  a  comprehensive 
understanding of how the AS manufacturing process impacts on CQAs. The control strategy for the AS 
manufacturing process was established by determining the overall risk for each attribute. The presented 
overall control strategy is deemed acceptable.

Characterisation 
Multiple mass spectrometric methods were employed to characterize the structure of AS. Analysis of free 
thiol and experimental extinction coefficient verification were also performed. The higher order structure 
of AS was evaluated using multiple biophysical techniques. The thermal denaturation profile was also 
characterized. The observed secondary and higher order structures were found to be typical for IgG1 
monoclonal antibodies. the distribution of AS containing different amounts of conjugated drug-linker was 
described. The binding activity, cytotoxicity activity, and FcγRI, IIA, and IIIA activity of the drug load 
isoforms were assessed with appropriate binding and cell-based assays.  
Process impurities for the AS process including FDRI are controlled in the active substance specification 
according  to  ICH  Q3A(R2).  Robust  clearance  was  demonstrated  for  small  molecular  process  related 
impurities in the impurity clearance studies. 
Size  variants,  unconjugated  antibody,  acidic  charge  variants,  and  conjugated  impurities  have  been 
classified as product-related impurities. 
Specification 
Specifications for enfortumab vedotin AS have been set based on principles outlined in ICH Q6A and ICH 
Q6B. Quality attributes controlled via specifications were identified by risk analysis which resulted in an 
appropriate control strategy. Tests are included for appearance and identity, strength and potency, purity 
and microbiological characteristics. 
The specifications are adequate. Product-related impurities are controlled as well as the process-related 
impurities FDRI. Furthermore, other tests (appearance, pH, osmolality, identity, protein concentration, 
potency, microbiology and polysorbate 20 are also included in the specification). Two potency methods 
were proposed in the AS specification; Binding ELISA and cytotoxicity assay with also the determination 
of the DAR.  
Compendial  analytical  procedures  follow  the  current  edition  of  the  referenced  pharmacopeia.  Non-
compendial  analytical  procedures  are  provided.  Descriptions  of  analytical  methods  are  sufficiently 
detailed  including  system  suitability  criteria  and  the  calculation  formulas.  The  compendial  analytical 
procedures have been qualified for their intended use. The non-compendial analytical procedures have 
been validated according to ICH Q2 (R1) and found suitable for their intended purposes.  
Batch analysis data for enfortumab vedotin active substance manufactured with the different processes 
are provided. These batches were tested by the methods at time of release and the acceptance criteria 
were met. The data further indicate the material derived from the different processes can be considered 
comparable. 
Reference material 
The  reference  standards  were  prepared  from  at  scale  Process  B  AS  engineering  batch  without 
reprocessing or reformulation. Future reference standards will be prepared and fully qualified to ensure 
sufficient  inventory  for  release  and  stability  testing.  These  standards  will  originate  from  material 
representative of the commercial process and will be qualified against the primary reference standard 
according to predefined acceptance criteria.  
Container Closure System 
The container closure system is in line with current pharmaceutical containers used for biotech product  
manufacturing. The enfortumab vedotin active substance is stored in a 2 L sterile Polycarbonate (PC) 
container. No extractable/leachable study will be performed based on the risk analysis provided.

Stability 
Batches that have been placed on stability are summarized and the acceptance criteria are provided.  
Stability studies were taken place under multiple storage conditions (≤ –60°C, –20±5°C and 5± 3°C). 
The proposed shelf life of 36 months for enfortumab vedotin AS when stored below -60°C is based on 
real time data of primary stability batches and deemed acceptable.  
2.2.5.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development

A  series  of  formulation  screening  studies  for  enfortumab  vedotin  was  conducted  with  respect  to  the 
buffering  agent,  formulation  pH,  and  bulking  agent  to  establish  the  formulation  composition  with  the 
sufficient levels of stability. There are no overages included in the manufacture of the finished product.  
An overfill volume was evaluated to meet the FP label claim for both 20 mg and 30 mg FP  strengths 
according to USP <697> with a target concentration after reconstitution of 10 mg/mL EV. The overfill 
volume of 0.4 mL for both FP (20 mg) and FP (30 mg) was determined resulting in fill volumes of 2.4 
mL and 3.4 mL, respectively. 
Two manufacturing processes have been established for enfortumab vedotin finished product referred to 
as Process A and Process B (proposed commercial). Batch genealogy and a list of batches used in clinical 
studies  are  provided.  Overall  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  materials  used  in  clinical  studies  can  be 
considered comparable to material which is foreseen for commercialization. 
The primary packaging components, 10 mL Type I glass vial and stopper, meet European Pharmacopoeia 
compendial  requirements  for  glass  containers  for  pharmaceutical  use  and  elastomeric  closures  for 
injection.  Given  that  the  FP  is  lyophilized,  the  risk  of  leachables  from  the  primary  container  closure 
system is low and the reconstituted FP is only in transient contact with the container closure.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Satisfactory GMP documentation has been provided by the finished product manufacturing and testing 
sites. 
There is no additional formulating process performed during FP manufacturing. The enfortumab vedotin 
finished product manufacturing process includes the following unit operations: AS Thawing, AS Pooling 
and  Mixing,  Sterile  Filtration,  Aseptic  Filling,  Lyophilization,  Capping,  Visual  Inspection,  and  Bulk  vial 
packaging  AS  bottles  are  thawed  at  ambient  temperature.  The  description  of  the  FP  manufacturing 
process  is  in  accordance  with  the  process  validation  data.  Steps  with  CPPs  and/or  critical  IPCs  are 
considered the critical steps. They are controlled through control of CPPs and critical IPCs.  
Six  batches  comprised  of  three  batches  for  30  mg/vial  strengths  and  three  batches  for  20  mg/vial 
strengths were successfully manufactured to the PPQ criteria. 
Aseptic manufacture is further ensured by media fill validation. Maximum processing times are defined 
and  are  in  line  with  the  validation  data.  All  excipients  in  enfortumab  vedotin  finished  product  are 
compendial and commonly used in the formulation of recombinant protein products. 
Product specification  
Specifications for enfortumab vedotin FP are set in accordance with the principles defined in ICH Q6B. 
Tests are included for appearance and identity, strength and potency, purity and microbiological 
characteristics. 
Purity testing and limits are equivalent to those stated for the active substance, with the addition of a 
test for subvisible particles. Elemental impurities have been controlled at the level of the active substance 
and comply with ICH Q3D. 
A  multistep  risk  assessment  was  conducted  by  the  applicant  with  regard  to  potential  presence  of 
nitrosamines and nitrosating agents. The assessment of AS indicated that enfortumab vedotin AS does 
not have any risk to contain nitrosamines and nitrosating agents. Also, in manufacturing process of FPs 
and primary packaging materials, risks on containing nitrosamines and nitrosating agents are considered 
very low. 
Specification 
Stability indicating methods are used for testing during stability studies. It is acceptable to use container 
closure  integrity  (CCI)  instead  of  sterility  during  ongoing  stability  studies.  The  reconstitution  time  is 
added to the release specification. The proposed acceptance criteria are acceptable.  
Compendial  analytical  procedures  follow  the  current  edition  of  the  referenced  pharmacopeia.  Non-
compendial  analytical  procedures  descriptions  include  the  preparation  of  samples  for  analysis,  the 
conditions of analysis, and the calculation formulas. The majority of methods is already presented in the 
AS section. Only FP specific methods are provided in the FP section. Compendial analytical procedures 
have  been  qualified  for  their  intended  use.  This  includes  endotoxin  and  sterility  testing.  For  non-
compendial  analytical  procedures  validation  results  for  the  analytical  procedures  are  summarized  and 
mainly covered in the AS section. The dye penetration procedure can be considered suitable for used for 
Container Closure Integrity Testing. Enfortumab vedotin FP 20 mg and 30 mg batch analysis data are 
provided.  All  results  are  within  specification  criteria  at  time  of  release  and  confirm  the  FP  can  be 
manufactured consistently. 
Reference standard 
Reference standard used for finished product testing is the same as for the active substance.

Container Closure System 
The primary packaging components, 10 mL Type I glass vial and stopper, meet European Pharmacopoeia 
compendial  requirements  for  glass  containers  for  pharmaceutical  use  and  elastomeric  closures  for 
injection.  Given  that  the  FP  is  lyophilized,  the  risk  of  leachables  from  the  primary  container  closure 
system is low and the reconstituted FP is only in transient contact with the container closure.  
Stability of the product 
Batches that have been placed on stability are summarized and the acceptance criteria are provided.  
Batches from both Process A and Process B at 20 mg and 30 mg were stored at 5± 3°C, 25°C/60% RH 
and 40°C/75% RH.  
The applicant proposes a 36 months shelf-life for both 20 mg and 30 mg finished product. Considering 
that the fill volume is the only difference between the two strength it is acceptable to assign the same 
shelf life for both 20 mg and 30 mg finished product. The data support the claimed shelf-life of 36 months 
when stored at 2-8°C. 
Adventitious agents 
TSE compliance 
All raw materials used in the manufacture process of enfortumab vedotin are sourced from qualified / 
approved vendors. The whole production process of enfortumab vedotin, including active substance and 
finished product manufacture, is free of animal or human derived materials. The product intermediates, 
AGS-22C3 mAb and its corresponding master and working cell bank as well as the SGD-1006 drug linker, 
are  also  produced  without  materials  of  direct  animal  or  human  origin  with  the  exception  of  the  AGS-
22C3 expression cell line.  
Virus safety 
No direct animal or human derived reagents are used in the manufacture of enfortumab vedotin including 
the intermediates AGS-22C3 mAb and its corresponding master and working cell bank as well as SGD-
1006 drug linker with the exception of the AGS-22C3 mAb expression cell line. None of the excipients 
are  of  human  or  animal  origin.  The  AGS-22C3  master  cell  bank,  working  cell  bank  and  an  end-of-
production  cell  bank  have  been  tested  sufficiently  for  adventitious  viruses  as  well  as  retroviruses  in 
accordance  with  ICH  Q5A.  No  viruses  except  A-type  retrovirus-like  particles  were  detected  which  is 
acceptable as CHO-derived cells are known to produce such particles. The unprocessed bulk harvest is 
also tested routinely in compliance with ICH Q5A for adventitious viruses. No viruses may be found by 
these  assays  for  further  processing  of  the  batch.  Retrovirus-like  particles  have  been  found  in  several 
batches of the commercial process and the maximum number detected has been used for calculation of 
the retrovirus safety margin. The mAb purification process has been investigated for virus reduction in 
scale  down  models  with  representative  viruses  being  appropriate  to  cover  a  wide  range  of  physico-
chemical behavior and resistance to inactivation/removal procedures. The studies were well conducted 
and in line with requirements of ICH Q5A and “Note for guidance on virus validation studies: the design, 
contribution  and  interpretation  of  studies  validating  the  inactivation  and  removal  or  viruses” 
(CPMP/BWP/268/95).  The  scale  down  runs  were  performed  either  at  expected  worst  case  or  target 
parameters. In summary, the virus safety of enfortumab vedotin has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
2.2.6.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Enfortumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate targeting Nectin-4, an adhesion protein that is highly 
expressed in urothelial cancer, a common and aggressive malignancy. Enfortumab vedotin is comprised 
of a fully human anti-Nectin-4 immunoglobulin G1 kappa monoclonal antibody conjugated to the small 
molecule  microtubule-disrupting  agent  monomethyl  auristatin  E  (MMAE),  via  a  protease-cleavable

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
The  pharmacodynamic  activity  of  enfortumab  vedotin  was  conducted  in  both  in  vitro  and  in  vivo 
experimental systems. 
In vitro 
Binding to Nectin-4 
AGS-22M6E (hybridoma ADC)was characterized for binding specifically to human, cynomolgus monkey, 
rat and mouse Nectin-4 orthologs exogenously expressed on the surface of a human prostate cancer 
cell line (PC3 cells) and to human cancer cell lines that endogenously express Nectin-4 in vitro. The 
apparent binding affinity (dissociation constant, KD) value of AGS-22M6E (hybridoma ADC)  was 
determined to be 0.387, 0.434, 0.463 and 3.79 nmol/L when tested against human, cynomolgus 
monkey, rat and mouse Nectin-4, respectively. Both enfortumab vedotin and AGS-22M6E bound 
specifically to the human Nectin-4-expressing PC3 cells with near identical binding constants showing

that both the hybridoma- and CHO-derived substances have similar binding affinities for the target 
antigen.

AGS-22M6E binds to recombinant human, cynomolgus monkey, rat and murine orthologs of 
Nectin-4 
The binding specificity and apparent affinity of AGS-22M6 and AGS-22M6E (HYBRIDOMA ADC)  to 
various orthologs of Nectin-4 was determined by FACS based binding assay using the following 
recombinant PC3 cell lines: PC3-human-Nectin-4, PC3- cynomolgus monkey-Nectin-4, PC3-rat- Nectin-
4 and PC3-murine-Nectin-4. The apparent KD values ranged from 0.279 nM to 70.3 nM for AGS-22M6 
and 0.3869 nM to 3.787 nM for AGS-22M6E (HYBRIDOMA ADC) . 
Table 4 Affinity of AGS-22M6 and AGS-22M6E to variants orthologs of Nectin-4 expressed on 
recombinant PC3 cells.  
Specific binding of the ADC to Nectin-4 
Nectin-4 is one of four members of a family of cell surface single transmembrane cell-cell adhesion 
molecules, Nectins-1-4, that interact in homophilic and heterophilic fashion with protein on the surface 
of adjacent cells. FACS analysis showed that the monoclonal antibody AGS-22M6, and its antibody 
drug conjugate AGS-22M6E (HYBRIDOMA ADC), bind specifically to recombinant Rat1 (E) cells 
expressing Nectin-4, but not to recombinant Rat1(E) cells expressing Nectin-1, Nectin-2, or Nectin-3.

Enfortumab vedotin binds to Nectin-4 on the cell surface resulting in the internalization of the ADC-
Nectin-4 complex, which then traffics to the lysosomal compartment where MMAE is released via 
proteolytic cleavage of the linker. Intracellular release of MMAE subsequently disrupts tubulin 
polymerization, resulting in G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of the tumor cells

Nectin-4 bound AGS-22C3E ADC internalized to lysosomal vesicles in a bladder carcinoma cell line, T24 
hNectin-4 (clone: 1A9), engineered to have high cell surface Nectin-4 expression. After 2 hours of 
incubation, most cells showed some AGS-22C3E internalization and colocalization to lysosomal 
vesicles, while a substantial portion of AGS-22C3E remained at the plasma membrane, particularly in 
the cell-cell junctions. The AGS-22C3E cell membrane staining signal continued to decrease after 4 
hours and after 24 hours the overall signal was greatly reduced, suggesting most of the cell surface 
AGS-22C3E bound to Nectin-4 had been internalized and catabolized by the cells.

delivered 95 nM and 249 nM intracellular MMAE to T24-hNectin-4 (clone: 1A9) cells at 100 ng/mL and 
1,000 ng/mL ADC treatment concentrations, respectively. In contrast, intracellular MMAE drug 
delivered to T24 parental cells by AGS-22C3E was below the lower limit of quantitation (3.2 fmol) at 
100 ng/mL and 0.6 nM at 1,000 ng/mL. demonstrating that AGS-22C3E delivers MMAE to tumor cells

Cytotoxicity 
Potency of AGS-22M6E (HYBRIDOMA ADC)  and AGS-22M6 to induce cell death was evaluated first in a 
panel of PC3 cell lines engineered to express Nectin-4 antigen of human, cynomolgus monkey, rat and 
mouse origin. The data showed that AGS-22M6E (HYBRIDOMA ADC)  specifically induces potent 
cytotoxic effect in the recombinant PC3 cells expressing the Nectin-4 orthologs with IC50 values 
ranging 0.008 –0.20 nM. The data also demonstrated potent cytotoxic activity of AGS-22M6E 
(HYBRIDOMA ADC)  in T47D breast carcinoma cell line that endogenously expresses Nectin-4. IC50 
value for inhibition of T47D cell survival was determined as 0.28 nM. Table 11.

Evaluation of Antibody Dependent Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity (ADCC) 
The anti-Nectin-4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) AGS-22C3 and the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) ASG-
22CE were investigated for their ability to mediate antibody dependent cytotoxicity (ADCC) using 
target cell lines BT-483 (breast carcinoma) and PC3-AGS22 (human prostate carcinoma cell line 
expressing recombinant Nectin-4) in the presence of effector cells, normal human peripheral blood 
mononuclear cells (PBMCs), using the CytoTox 96® Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega). 
The release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) by the target cells was measured in the colorimetric 
enzymatic assay. The amount of LDH released is directly proportional to the amount of ADCC activity. 
Results obtained in the study indicate that neither the antibody AGS-22C3 nor the ADC ASG-22CE 
promote ADCC activity when tested using target cell lines BT-483 and PC3-AGS22 in the presence of 
effector cells, normal human PBMCs. 
The positive control setup using Herceptin (anti-Her2 antibody) in the presence of the BT-483 target 
cells, demonstrated moderate ADCC activity (55%)

Evaluation of Complement-Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC) 
The anti-Nectin-4 monoclonal antibody (mAb) AGS-22C3 and the antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) ASG-
22CE were investigated for their ability to mediate complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) using 
target cell lines BT-483 (breast carcinoma) and PC3-AGS22 (human prostate carcinoma cell line 
expressing recombinant Nectin-4) in the presence of baby rabbit complement. Cell death within the 
target cells was assessed by the addition of propidium iodide (PI) as a viability probe and analyzed by 
flow cytometry. Results obtained in the study indicate that neither the antibody AGS-22C3 nor the ADC 
ASG-22CE promote CDC activity when tested using target cell lines BT-483 and PC3-AGS22 in the 
presence of baby rabbit complement. 
The human prostate carcinoma cell line engineered to express Nectin-4, PC3-AGS22, and breast 
carcinoma cell line BT-483 which endogenously expresses Nectin-4, were used as target cells in the 
study. Results obtained in the study indicate that neither antibody AGS-22C3 nor antibody-drug 
conjugate ASG-22CE promote CDC activity when tested against the target cell lines BT-483 and PC3-
AGS22 in the presence of baby rabbit complement. The positive control setup using the antibody 
Rituximab and target cells Raji demonstrated strong CDC activity, ranging from 40% to 71% at various 
concentrations.

•  Bystander effect secondary to release of MMAE from targeted tumor cells 
Two bladder carcinoma cell lines lacking endogenous Nectin-4, T24 and UM-UC-3, were transduced  to 
overexpressing cell surface human Nectin-4 protein. The Nectin-4 targeting antibody drug conjugate 
AGS-22C3E had potent cytotoxic activity against the T24-hNectin-4 and UMUC3-hNectin4 cell lines, but 
was not active against T24 and UM-UC-3 cell lines engineered to overexpress green fluorescent protein 
(GFP). These cell lines were used to generate two co-culture model systems to measure AGS-22C3E in 
vitro bystander effect activity. Nectin-4 positive bladder carcinoma cells were mixed with Nectin-4 
negative bladder carcinoma cells at a controlled 1:1 ratio, then treated for 72 or 168 hours with AGS-
22C3E ADC. Bystander effect activity was determined using flow cytometry by measuring the percent 
cell viability decline of the Nectin-4 negative, GFP positive tumor cell population.

Efficacy Study of AGS-22M6E (HYBRIDOMA ADC)  in a Xenograft Model of Human Bladder 
Cancer AG-B1 in SCID Mice 
AG-B1 xenograft tumors were implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice and treatment started when 
tumors reached approximately 200 mm3.  
AGS-22M6E (HYBRIDOMA ADC) was tested at 0.4 mg/kg and 0.8 mg/kg every 4 days until study 
termination. A control ADC, H3-1.4.1.2-vcE (0.4 and 0.8 mg/kg), the unconjugated antibody AGS-
22M6 (0.8 mg/kg) and the vehicle, 5% dextrose, were used as controls. The results showed that AGS-
22M6E (HYBRIDOMA ADC)  at 0.8 mg/kg statistically significantly inhibited tumor growth when 
compared to H3-1.4.1.2-vcE 0.8 mg/kg (p=0.0128), the antibody AGS-22M6 (p=0.0004) or 5% 
dextrose (p<0.0001), resulting in 70.9%, 75.3% and 75.7% tumor inhibition respectively. AGS-22M6E 
(HYBRIDOMA ADC) given at the lower dose of 0.4 mg/kg did not show significant antitumor activity 
when compared to any of the controls (p>0.05). Statistically significant difference (p=0.0063) was 
detected when the two doses of AGS-22M6E (HYBRIDOMA ADC) were compared, indicating the efficacy 
of AGS-22M6E (HYBRIDOMA ADC)  was dose-dependent.

0.5 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, and 1.5 mg/kg, given intravenously twice a week for a total of three doses 
when compared to either the IgG1 isotype control ADC H3-1.4.1.2-vcE (p<0.0001) or the 5% Dextrose 
vehicle control (p<0.0001). Moreover, ASG-22CE at 0.5 mg/kg, 1.0 mg/kg, and 1.5 mg/kg, 
statistically significantly regressed the tumors by 12.0% (p=0.0044), 24.2% (p<0.0001), and 38.0%

(p<0.0001), respectively, when compared to the tumor size at the baseline.. Statistically significant 
difference in efficacy was observed between the 1.5 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg dose groups (p=0.0006) on 
day 21.

Efficacy Study Comparing Hybridoma Cell Line-Derived AGS-22M6E and CHO Cell Line-
Derived AGS-22C3E in a Subcutaneously Established Xenograft Model of Human Breast 
Cancer AG-Br7 in SCID Mice 
The antitumor efficacy of AGS-22M6E (HYBRIDOMA ADC)  produced in hybridoma cells was compared 
to AGS-22C3E produced in CHO cells using the AG-Br7 patient-derived human breast cancer xenograft 
model. AG-Br7 xenograft tumors were implanted subcutaneously in SCID mice, and treatment was 
initiated when tumors reached approximately 200 mm3. AG-Br7 tumor-bearing mice were randomized 
into control and treatment groups. Animals in each of the treatment groups were administered either 
AGS-22M6E (HYBRIDOMA ADC)  or AGS-22C3E, at 1.0 mg/kg or 2.0 mg/kg, twice per week until study 
termination. The control groups received the control ADC, H3-1.4.1.2-vcE, at 1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg, and 
also included a vehicle-treated arm (5% dextrose). 
The tumor growth inhibition caused by both the hybridoma-derived and the CHO-derived ADCs was 
similar with no statistical difference between the AGS-22M6E and AGS-22C3E-treated groups 
(p>0.9999). Neither AGS-22M6E (HYBRIDOMA ADC)  nor AGS-22C3E given at the lower dose of 1.0 
mg/kg showed significant efficacy when compared to the vehicle or to the control ADC, H3-1.4.1.2-
vcE, at identical dose (p=0.8879 and p=0.4154, respectively).

Figure 16 Tumor Volume Over time  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies of the ADCs were conducted; however, the hypothetical 
secondary effects of an ADC binding to Nectin-4 were discussed using a review of literature. 
Skin toxicity observed with enfortumab vedotin in animals and patientsis are considered due entirely to 
target-dependent ADC uptake of MMAE in rapidly dividing epithelial cells. 
The embryo-fetal toxicity observed is consistent with the pharmacology of MMAE on rapidly dividing 
cells.  
Male animals from the repeat dose cynomolgus monkey toxicity study showed no indications of 
mammary gland effects at lethal doses (6 mg/kg per week).  
In humans, Nectin-4 is involved as a mediator of measles virus entry into cells via Nectin-4-mediated 
micropinocytosis. There is a theoretical risk for coadministration of enfortumab vedotin with live 
measles vaccine. The attenuated live viruses used in measles vaccinations gain an adaption from 
growth in cell culture to enter cells also using CD46, a human membrane receptor expressed on all 
nucleated cells [Delpeut et al, 2014; Naniche et al, 1993]. Therefore, blockade of Nectin-4 is 
considered of minimal significance for vaccinations in the intended patient population.  
The toxicity studies results show the ADC and the unconjugated antibody have no similar toxicological 
findings to those observed with antiangiogenic compounds and hence this is not considered a relevant 
pharmacology aspect. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Enfortumab vedotin safety pharmocolagy have been studied in vitro and in vivo. In vitro safety 
pharmacology was limited to the effects of MMAE on potassium conductance via the hERG channel.

The effect of SGD-1010 on hERG K+ channels, heterologously expressed in Human Embryonic Kidney 
(HEK293) cells, was evaluated using the conventional whole cell voltage clamp technique. The effects 
on hERG K+ currents were examined by measuring peak hERG tail current before and during test and

control article exposure at 35 ± 1oC. SGD-1010 effects at 10 and 100 μM were compared to the 
negative control (extracellular saline). Cisapride hydrate (25nM) was used as a positive control. MMAE, 
at concentrations 19405-fold higher than the clinically observed Cmax, had limited (less than 50%) 
inhibition of potassium conductance via the hERG channel and at 10 μmol/L there was no significant 
inhibition of hERG channel activity.  
Table 11 Mean Fractional block of peak hERG tail current and summary statistics  
No effect was observed on the Fridericia corrected QT interval and RR-interval in cynomolgus monkeys 
at concentrations of AGS-22M6E up to approximately 6-fold the clinically observed Cmax. The ADC was 
not evaluated as the antibody component is too large to cross plasma membranes and therefore would 
be unable to access and block the promiscuous inner pore of the hERG channel.  
No effect was observed on ECG, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory or CNS safety pharmacology 
parameters evaluated as part of the general toxicology studies performed in cynomolgus monkeys with 
the ADC. 
Enfortumab vedotin has no signals for safety pharmacology endpoints. In addition, there was no 
evidence of a clinical safety pharmacology signal. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions of enfortumab vedotin have not been submitted in non-clinical 
studies. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics studies 
The pharmacokinetics (toxicokinetics) of enfortumab vedotin, AGS-22M6E (HYBRIDOMA ADC), AGS-
22M6 (unconjugated antibody) or MMAE were evaluated through 4-week intravenous dose toxicity 
studies in rats and/or cynomolgus monkeys after the first and the last dose. Immunogenicity of ADCs 
was also evaluated in these toxicity studies.  
Since enfortumab vedotin and AGS-22M6E (HYBRIDOMA ADC)  share the same linker-drug conjugation 
of brentuximab vedotin, historical plasma protein binding, metabolism, excretion and in vitro drug 
interaction potential of MMAE are discussed. No new studies were conducted to characterize the 
distribution, metabolism and excretion of enfortumab vedotin or AGS-22M6E (HYBRIDOMA ADC). 
Methods of analysis Distinct methods of analysis were used to detect the antibody and small 
molecule components of enfortumab vedotin to support the toxicokinetic evaluations for each species 
and with each drug substance. Methods included immunoassays for antibody analytes in various 
biological matrices and liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) for MMAE. 
All toxicokinetic assays were fully validated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/249357/2022 
Page 39/188 
 
 
 
 
 
Immunoassays were developed to measure the antibody components as well as immunogenicity 
against the therapeutic. LC-MS/MS assays were employed to measure circulating amounts of the small 
cytotoxic molecule released from the ADC. The toxicokinetic analytes measured included ADC (AGS-
22M6E (HYBRIDOMA ADC)  [hybridoma derived] or enfortumab vedotin [CHO derived]), TAb (ADC plus 
unconjugated antibody), MMAE and Anti Therapeutics Antibody (ATA).

Immunogenicity  
Anti-drug antibody (ADA) formation was evaluated in conjunction with the toxicokinetic assessment of 
exposure in nonclinical studies of AGS-22M6E, AGS-22M6 and enfortumab vedotin (Table 27 ). In 
general, the incidence of ATA to AGS-22M6E (HYBRIDOMA ADC) appeared to be higher in cynomolgus 
monkeys than in rats, and the incidence of ATA to AGS-22M6E (HYBRIDOMA ADC)  compared to 
enfortumab vedotin appeared to be similar in cynomolgus monkeys.

Distribution  
No distribution studies have been conducted with AGS-22M6E (HYBRIDOMA ADC)  or enfortumab 
vedotin.  
The distribution of MMAE was assessed by determination of in vitro plasma protein binding, blood cell 
partitioning and 3H-MMAE distribution in rats.

Tissue Distribution via Quantitative Whole-Body Autoradiography in Male Long-Evans Rats 
Following a Single Intravenous Bolus Administration of 3H-MMAE 
3H-MMAE-derived radioactivity in Long-Evans rats was well distributed and most tissues had 
concentrations that were higher than blood from 0.17 hours through 24 hours postdose. The highest 
overall concentrations were observed in bile (1.476 μg eq./g at 0.17 hours), the contents of the 
alimentary canal (Cmax ranged from 0.019 μg eq./g in stomach contents at 24 hours to 0.975 μg 
eq./g in large intestine contents at 12 hours) and urinary bladder (0.369 μg eq./g at 4 hours). 
Concentrations of > 0.20 μg eq./g at Cmax were found in anterior pituitary gland, lung, kidney cortex 
and kidney medulla. Elimination of radioactivity from most tissues was observed at 96 hours postdose, 
except for thymus, anterior and posterior pituitary glands and eye uveal tract, which were 0.013, 
0.006, 0.005 and 0.009 μg eq./g, respectively.  
The observed 3H-exchange in the plasma may have an effect on the interpretation of the tissue 
distribution data, especially after 4 hours postdose. There was approximately 10% in vivo 3H-
exchange in plasma observed at 0.17 hours, and the extent of 3H-exchange increased to 
approximately 36% at 4 hours, 49% at 12 hours, 73% at 24 hours, and 96% at 96 hours. 
Plasma Protein Binding Assay of MMAE by Ultracentrifugation 
The plasma protein binding of MMAE in mouse, rat, monkey and human was assessed by evaluation of 
the in vitro plasma protein binding ratios. [3H]-MMAE was added to mouse, rat, monkey and human 
plasma at 3 concentrations (1 nmol/L, 10 nmol/L and 100 nmol/L), and the mixtures were 
ultracentrifuged. Radioactivity in plasma and supernatant was measured by liquid scintillation counting 
and the plasma protein binding ratio was calculated. 
The protein binding ratios in mouse, rat, monkey and human plasma are tabulated below [3H]- MMAE, 
exhibits species dependent plasma protein binding and binding exhibits minimal dependence on [3H]-
MMAE concentration over the range of 1 – 100 nmol/L. 
An in vitro study was conducted to evaluate the red blood cell (RBC) partitioning potential of MMAE in 
mice, rats, cynomolgus monkeys and humans. The blood to plasma concentration ratios of MMAE were 
9.47 to 11.8 in mice, 1.86 to 2.36 in rats, 1.40 to 1.57 in cynomolgus monkeys and 0.926 to 0.976 in 
humans at 2 and 20 nmol/L (clinically relevant concentrations). The RBC partitioning was inversely 
concentration dependent at concentrations less than 1000 nmol/L in mouse, rat and cynomolgus 
monkey, whereas in human, no significant concentration dependency was observed. 
Metabolism  
Traditional metabolism studies were not performed for the antibody component, AGS-22C3, which is  
expected to be catabolized into small peptides and amino acids, and to be  excreted or recycled by the 
body.  
Metabolism studies with 3H-MMAE were performed using both cultured hepatocytes and liver 
microsomes in vitro model systems. Hepatocytes were employed for metabolite identification study, 
while the microsomal systems were used for reaction phenotyping. Key findings from these studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/249357/2022

showed in vitro metabolism of MMAE in human hepatocytes generated the same metabolites observed 
in rat and cynomolgus monkey in vitro assays and MMAE is a CYP3A4 substrate. 
In vitro metabolite profiling 
MMAE (Study XT084007, non-GLP) - Cross-Species Metabolism  
A non-GLP study was conducted to determine in vitro metabolic profile of 3H-MMAE at 10 μmol/L 
following incubation with cryopreserved Sprague-Dawley rat, Cynomolgus monkey and human 
hepatocytes. The substrate loss data suggest that the initial rate and overall extent of 3H-MMAE 
metabolism by hepatocytes were comparable for all three species. A substrate loss of 32, 18 and 32% 
was observed over the 240-min incubation period with rat, monkey and human hepatocytes, 
respectively. Mass spectrometry analysis of the samples proposes formation of metabolites by 
hydroxylation, demethylation, dehydrogenation or hydrolysis. All metabolites detected in human 
hepatocytes were also detected in rat and/or cynomolgus monkey hepatocytes. 
Table 23 Metabolites detected in vitro in animal species and in human 
Reaction Phenotyping - Human CYP Enzymes Involved in the In Vitro Metabolism 
MMAE (Study XT084006, non-GLP) 
3H-MMAE was converted to eight radioactive components by NADPH-fortified human liver microsomes, 
the major components being 7.0, 8.6 and 11.1. These components are proposed metabolites formed 
by O-demethylation (−14 amu), N-demethylation (−14 amu) and dehydrogenation (−2 amu), 
respectively. The formation of these major components by human liver microsomes was primarily 
mediated by CYP3A4 as determined by correlation analysis, experiments with recombinant human CYP 
enzymes and experiments with CYP-selective inhibitors. Additional CYP enzymes (e.g., CYP2D6) may 
be minor contributors to the formation of these components, and carbonyl reductases may conceivably 
contribute to the formation of component 11.1

In vivo  
MMAE in rats (study 420501, GLP) - Excretion, Mass Balance and Pharmacokinetics  
Metabolite profiling in urine and feces was conducted after intravenous administration of 3H-MMAE at 
0.056 mg/kg (GLP). The radioactive species in urine and feces were determined using an HPLC 
radiometric/UV detection method and metabolites identified by LC-MS/MS. The primary molecular 
species excreted in feces and urine in animals dosed with 3H-MMAE was identified as unchanged 3H-
MMAE. In feces, in addition to 3H-MMAE, a second radiolabeled molecular species was observed and 
identified by LC-MS/MS as dolaproline O-desmethyl-MMAE, a metabolite of the parent drug. 
In urine, additional metabolites were observed, but no attempt was made to identify them by LC-
MS/MS because of their low abundance. 
Comparison of MMAE metabolism between rat species and human (study CPH-SGN35-001)  
A clinical evaluation of the metabolism of MMAE in humans following a single intravenous dose of 
brentuximab vedotin (ADCETRIS, MAA in 2012) was performed with the excretion (urine and feces) 
samples collected. Patients with CD30-positive hematologic malignancies were treated with 1.8 mg/kg 
of brentuximab vedotin. Urine and feces were collected daily for 7 days post dose. Urine and feces 
were analyzed for MMAE metabolites by HPLC-MS/MS. Multiple minor metabolites were identified in 
urine and feces, presented in table 20.

Excretion  
An excretion study was performed in rats following a single intravenous dose of 3H-MMAE. No other 
nonclinical excretion studies have been performed. The major route of elimination in rats dosed with 
3H-MMAE was via feces. 
MMAE in rats (study 420501, GLP) - Excretion, Mass Balance and Pharmacokinetics  
Excretion was studied in urine and feces after intravenous administration of 3H-MMAE at 0.056 mg/kg 
in rats. The concentrations of radioactivity in blood, plasma, urine, feces and carcass were determined 
by liquid scintillation counting method. The major route of elimination in animals dosed with 3H-MMAE 
was via feces. For 3H-MMAE, mass balance was achieved with approximately 112% recovery of 
radioactivity in male and female rats. The majority of the radioactivity was recovered in feces for both 
male and female rats.

Excretion into milk 
Studies of enfortumab vedotin excretion in milk were not performed. Therefore, it is not known 
whether enfortumab vedotin or the active moiety SGD-1010 (MMAE)is excreted in human milk. 
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
The potential of MMAE to cause metabolic drug interactions has been assessed in vitro. In human 
hepatocytes, MMAE is not an inducer of CYP1A2, 2B6 and 3A4/5. MMAE was a moderate time-
dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4/5 and a relatively weak reversible inhibitor of CYP3A4/5. In humans, 
the mean Cmax of MMAE following weekly administration of enfortumab vedotin at 1.25 mg/kg was 
approximately 5.2 nmol/L or 3.7 ng/mL [Study EV-201] (data cutoff date: 01 Mar 2019), which is 
approximately 3 orders of magnitude lower than the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) for 
CYP3A4/5. MMAE is a substrate of P-gp but not a substrate of other transporters tested. MMAE is not 
an inhibitor of any of the transporters tested at clinically relevant concentrations. 
Based on in vitro and in vivo metabolism studies, the predominant clearance pathway of MMAE in 
humans was likely via biliary/fecal excretion of intact parent molecule with limited CYP3A4/5-mediated 
metabolism. MMAE was identified as a CYP3A4 substrate. 
In Vitro Evaluation of MMAE as an Inducer of Cytochrome P450 Expression in Cultured 
Human Hepatocytes 
A non-GLP in vitro study was conducted to assess the potential of MMAE for CYP induction in cultured 
human hepatocytes from 3 donors. Hepatocytes were treated once daily for 3 consecutive days with 
MMAE at 4 concentrations (1, 10, 100 and 1000 nmol/L). Under the conditions of this study, treatment 
Assessment report  
EMA/249357/2022 
Page 48/188 
 
 
 
 
 
 
of cultured human hepatocytes with up to 1000 nmol/L MMAE caused little or no increase in CYP1A2, 
2B6 and 3A4/5 metabolic activity. In addition, MMAE did not cause any increase in CYP1A2, 2B6 and 
3A4 messenger RNA levels or Western immunoblot protein levels. However, treatment of MMAE at the 
higher concentrations (100 and 1000 nmol/L) caused decreases in CYP1A2, 2B6 and 3A4/5 metabolic 
activity, messenger RNA levels or Western immunoblot protein levels from all three hepatocyte 
preparations tested. 
In Vitro Evaluation of MMAE as an Inhibitor of Human Cytochrome P450 Enzymes 
To evaluate MMAE as a direct inhibitor of CYP activity, human liver microsomes from a pool of 16 
individuals were incubated with marker substrates, at concentrations approximately equal to their 
apparent concentration of substrate that leads to half-maximal reaction velocity, in the presence or 
absence of MMAE at concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 μmol/L. MMAE caused little or no direct 
inhibition of CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19 or 2D6. MMAE did exhibit direct inhibition of CYP3A4/5 as 
measured by midazolam 1´-hydroxylation with an IC50 value of 10 μmol/L, but did not inhibit 
CYP3A4/5 when measured by testosterone 6β-hydroxylation. MMAE also caused time-dependent 
inhibition of CYP3A4/5 as measured by both testosterone 6β-hydroxylation and midazolam 1´-
hydroxylation. 
In vitro Interaction Studies of MMAE with human BCRP, BSEP and MRP2 Efflux (ABC) 
Transporters, and with human OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1 and OCT2 Uptake 
Transporters  
A non-GLP in vitro assay was conducted to characterize the interaction of MMAE with the human efflux 
transporters BCRP, BSEP and MRP2 using vesicular transport system, and the human uptake 
transporters OAT1, OAT3,OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1 and OCT2 using CHO or HEK293 cells. MMAE did 
not influence the transporter-mediated probe substrate accumulation in the tested concentration range 
(from 0.008 to 5 μmol/L) for BCRP, BSEP and MRP2 assays. MMAE inhibited the OCT1- and OCT2-
mediated metformin transport at 5 μmol/L (the highest tested concentration) by 29% and 23%, 
respectively; however, MMAE did not influence the OAT1-, OAT3-, OATP1B1- or OATP1B3-mediated 
probe substrate accumulation up to the highest tested concentration of 5 μmol/L. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
Rats and cynomolgus monkeys were selected as the nonclinical test species based on equivalent 
binding affinities of the ADC to rat, cynomolgus monkey and human Nectin-4.  
Single dose toxicity studies were not performed. 
Repeat dose toxicity  
Enfortumab vedotin and AGS-22M6E are cross-reactive in the rat and cynomolgus monkey with 
equivalent binding affinity to human Nectin-4. Repeat dose toxicity studies were performed in both 
species. In general, similar toxicity profiles were observed across species and therefore only the rat 
was studied in the chronic (13-week) repeat dose toxicity study (please refer to ICH S6, S9, S9 Q&A). 
The intravenous administration route and weekly dosing schedule were chosen to support the proposed 
clinical route and dose regimen.  
Assessment report

The toxicity of MMAE and the unconjugated antibody, AGS-22M6, were studied in a 4-week repeat 
dose study in the cynomolgus monkey, with the unconjugated antibody also studied in a 4-week repeat 
dose study in the rat.

by Intravenous Injection to Sprague-Dawley Rats, with a 6-Week Recovery Period 
(study 20005662) 
AGS-22M6E at 10 mg/kg/dose resulted in one early death on Day 27. 
AGS-22M6E-related changes in clinical observations included slight skin abrasions in the majority of 5 
mg/kg-dosed animals, slight to moderate skin abrasion/sores in all 10 mg/kg-dosed animals and urine 
staining in individual 10 mg/kg dosed animals. Body weight gain was moderately decreased in 10-
mg/kg-dosed males and the average food consumption was minimally lower in 10-mg/kg-dosed males 
between weeks 3-4. There were no AGS-22M6E-related clinical observations or changes in food 
consumption in recovery animals. AGS-22M6E-related changes in hematology parameters occurred in 
Groups 3 (5 mg/kg/dose) and 4 (10 mg/kg/dose) animals and included decreased indicators of red cell 
mass (RBC, hemoglobin concentration and hematocrit), and increased MCV, RDW, MCH and 
reticulocyte counts at Days 16 and 29. There was a higher incidence of abnormal red blood cell shape 
including slight spherocytes, schistocytes, and acanthocytes in 10 mg/kg-dosed animals. 
AGS-22M6E-related changes in clinical chemistry parameters included increases in ALT, AST, ALP, and 
GGT levels in individual animals dosed at 5 and 10 mg/kg. In addition, albumin concentration (and 
total protein) was decreased in 10 mg/kg-dosed animals. At the end of the dose-free period (Day 64), 
all of the red blood cell parameters were substantially recovered (i.e., comparable to control) except 
RBC and MCV in males that had been dosed at 5 mg/kg and in males and females that had been dosed 
at 10 mg/kg. Also in Group 4, RDW (males only) and MCH were minimally increased. These residual

changes are biologically inconsequential. Other hematology parameters had completely recovered on 
Day 64.

Infusion to Cynomolgus Monkeys, with a 6-Week Recovery Period (study 20005664) 
Table 27 Study 20005664 
Administration of 6 mg/kg/dose AGS-22M6E was associated with moribundity after the 2nd weekly 
dose resulting in the unscheduled euthanasia of 3 animals on study Days 11-13. Administration of 
0.1093 mg/kg MMAE on Days 1 and 8 and 0.0545 mg/kg MMAE on Days 15 and 22 resulted in 1 
unscheduled euthanasia (Animal No. 6503) on Day 19. One MMAE treated animal was found dead on 
Day 13. 
Administration of 3 mg/kg/dose AGS-22M6E did result in abrasions and dry/reddened skin, 
decreased reticulocyte count as compared to concurrent controls on Day 8 and on Day 15 (females 
only); decreased red cell parameters in females only on Days 15, 22, and 29; decreased neutrophils on 
Days 15 and 22; decreased eosinophils on Days 22 and 29; microscopic injection site lesions (mild 
mononuclear cell dermal inflammation and marked non-septic vascular thrombus) noted in 1 female, 
and mild thymic atrophy in 2 females.  
Administration of 6 mg/kg/dose AGS-22M6E on Days 1 and 8 resulted in the unscheduled 
euthanasia of 3 animals on Days 11-13 due to severe dry skin/reddened skin and abrasions occurring 
over the entire body and around the eyes. 
Other test article-related findings included hematology changes (reduced reticulocyte and leukocyte 
counts) consistent with bone marrow toxicity. Reticulocyte counts were decreased on Days 8 and 
15(males only) in spite of reduced red cell mass. Leukocyte counts were decreased on Day 8 (total 
leukocyte, neutrophil, lymphocyte, monocyte and eosinophil counts) but these changes showed partial 
recovery by Day 15 after dose discontinuation. In addition, these animals had clinical pathology 
changes consistent with an acute phase response (decreased albumin and increased globulin and 
fibrinogen) and increased potassium. Microscopic findings in the animals euthanized early included 
injection site lesions characterized by inflammation and/or hemorrhage in the dermis and perivascular 
area, mild subcutaneous degeneration of the veins and moderate erosion of the epidermis; ulceration, 
inflammation and hyperkeratosis of the skin; and thymic atrophy, possibly related to the general 
health condition of the animals 
Administration of 0.1093 mg/kg MMAE on Days 1 and 8 and 0.0545 mg/kg MMAE on Days 15 and 
22 resulted in 1 unscheduled euthanasia due to a large patch of skin missing near the buttocks that 
could not be surgically repaired. Other test article-related effects from animals in this dose group were 
Assessment report  
EMA/249357/2022

similar to those noted for animals dosed with 6 mg/kg/dose AGS-22M6E with the exception that the 
dry/reddened skin and abrasions were largely not detected, but low food consumption and watery 
feces were. Clinical pathology changes from these animals were similar to those noted for AGS-22M6E-
dosed animals and included changes consistent with bone marrow toxicity (decreased reticulocyte 
counts in spite of reduced red cell mass and reduction in leukocyte counts) on Day 8 with at least a 
partial recovery for most of these effects on Day 15, with a reduction in dose level beginning on this 
day 
Based on these results, the AGS-22M6E NOAEL was 3 mg/kg/day (Cmax of 76.6 μg/mL, AUC(0-168h) 
of 2450 μg·h/mL on Day 1). 
A 4-Week Study of AGS-22M6E and AGS-22C3E by Intravenous Infusion Administration in 
Cynomolgus Monkeys with a 6-Week Recovery Period (study 20021751) 
The objectives of the study were to compare toxicologic and toxicokinetic properties of AGS-22M6E and 
AGS-22C3E, hybridoma and CHO-derived versions of the same product, when given at the same dose 
by weekly intravenous infusion for 4 weeks to cynomolgus monkeys.

article-related effects considered biologically significant included dry skin, reddened areas of skin, 
minimally decreased erythrocyte mass (red blood cell, hemoglobin, and hematocrit count), 
reticulocytes, neutrophils, and eosinophil counts, and microscopic findings in bone marrow, injection 
site, and skin. 
The primary analysis for comparability was based on calculation of area under the concentration-time 
curve from time 0 to 7 days (AUC0-7) and Cmax after the first dose for AGS-22M6E and AGS-22C3EF. 
The 90% confidence intervals (CI) of the geometric mean ratios (GMR) for AUC0−7 and Cmax of ADC 
after the first dose were within the pre-specified comparability criteria (0.7−1.43) and therefore 
toxicokinetics of the two materials, AGS-22M6E and AGS-22C3E were considered to be 
comparable.(Table 34)

Maximum serum AGS-22 concentrations for both antibody drug conjugates (ADC) were generally 
attained at the end of the IV infusion and showed a bi-exponential decline thereafter. Serum AGS-22 
concentrations determined with the total antibody (TAb) ELISA were generally higher than the ADC 
concentrations. There were no sex-related differences observed in the toxicokinetic characteristics for 
ADC, TAb and small molecule metabolite for both ADC.  
Maximum Monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) metabolite concentration (Cmax) for both ADCs was 
attained between 24-72 hours post AGS-22 dose injection. The elimination half-life (T½ λz) for MMAE 
after administration of AGS-22M6E and AGS-22C3E was calculated as 4.31 days and 3.54 days, 
respectively. 
A GLP 3-Month Intravenous Toxicity Study of Enfortumab Vedotin in Sprague Dawley Rats 
Eighty main study (10/sex/Groups 1 through 4) and 54 toxicokinetic satellite Sprague Dawley rats 
(9/sex/Groups 5 through 7) were administered either control article (5% [w/v] sterile dextrose 
solution) or Enfortumab Vedotin as a once weekly IV bolus injection for 13 total doses (i.e., dosing on 
Days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, 43, 50, 57, 64, 71, 78, and 85) at dose levels of 0.5, 2.0, and 5.0 
mg/kg/dose. The dosing concentration was 1.0 mg/mL for all groups, and the dose volume was 
adjusted to achieve the intended dose levels. Animals were observed for 13 weeks following the first 
dose, with scheduled necropsy on Day 92 for all main study animals.  
Table 30 A GLP 3-Month Intravenous Toxicity Study of Enfortumab Vedotin in Sprague Dawley Rats 
Study endpoints included morbidity and mortality assessment, clinical observations (including 
quantitative food consumption), body weights and body weight gain, ophthalmic exams, clinical 
pathology (hematology, clinical chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis), blood collection for bioanalysis, 
toxicokinetic (TK), and anti-therapeutic antibody (ATA) evaluations, and pathology evaluation (gross 
necropsy findings, organ weights, and histopathologic examinations). 
There were no Enfortumab Vedotin-related deaths. Definitive Enfortumab Vedotin-related clinical 
observations were limited to abrasions at 5 mg/kg/dose.

There were Enfortumab Vedotin-related changes in hematology and clinical chemistry parameters, 
most notably at 5 mg/kg/dose. Changes in hematology parameters consisted of decreased RBC mass 
(red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit) for males at 5 mg/kg/dose and females at ≥ 0.5 
mg/kg/dose, associated with minimally to mildly increased reticulocytes, mean corpuscular volume 
(males only), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (males only), and red cell distribution width at 5 
mg/kg/dose, and minimally to mildly increased platelets at ≥ 2 mg/kg/dose. Changes in clinical 
chemistry parameters included minimally to mildly increased alanine aminotransferase, aspartate 
aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma glutamyltransferase (1 male), and bilirubin at 5 
mg/kg/dose, in addition to minimally decreased albumin (females only) and albumin:globulin ratio and 
increased globulins at 5 mg/kg/dose. On Day 92, macroscopic changes included small and/or soft 
testes (microscopic degeneration/atrophy) at ≥ 2 mg/kg/dose that correlated with decreased absolute 
and relative testis weights. Secondary to Enfortumab Vedotin-related testicular degeneration/atrophy, 
cell debris, and reduced sperm were present in the epididymis at ≥ 2 mg/kg/dose. Other target organs 
of toxicity were identified including testis (≥ 2 mg/kg/dose), epididymis (≥ 2 mg/kg/dose), mammary 
gland (≥ 2 mg/kg/dose), eye (≥ 0.5 mg/kg/dose), harderian gland (5 mg/kg/dose), IV administration 
site (≥ 0.5 mg/kg/dose), and skin (5 mg/kg/dose). The primary histology findings in these tissues were 
abnormal mitotic indices, single cell necrosis, and/or degeneration/atrophy. 
Genotoxicity 
Genotoxicity studies (table 37 below) were performed on the cytotoxic agent, MMAE. MMAE had no 
discernible in vitro genotoxic potential in a reverse mutation test in bacteria (Ames test) or in a L5178Y 
thymidine kinase+/- mouse lymphoma mutation assay. On the contrary, MMAE was aneugenic in the in 
vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus study, consistent with the pharmacological effect of MMAE on the 
mitotic apparatus (disruption of the microtubular network). 
The linker portion of enfortumab vedotin is composed of maleimide, a caproyl spacer, vc dipeptide, and 
p-aminobenzyloxy carbonyl. The genotoxic potential of the linker molecule was assessed based on 
publically available data and by an in silico analysis. Maleimide is reported as being mutagenic in both 
the bacterial reverse mutation assay and the L5178Y thymidine kinase (TK)+/- mouse lymphoma 
forward mutation assay [TOXNET Toxicology Data Network; search term: maleimide] while caproic acid 
was negative in the bacterial reverse mutation assay [TOXNET Toxicology Data Network; search term: 
caproic acid]. In silico assessments of the valine, citrulline and the p-aminobenzyloxy carbonyl group 
by DEREK for Windows (version 12) indicated no structure alert for mutagenic potential with either 
moiety.

Testicular toxicity of Enfortumab Vedotin was observed in rats on day 29 of the 4-week repeat dose 
study and on day 92 of the 13-week repeat dose study. Changes in the testes were noted at ≥2 mg/kg 
per dose in the 4-week study and the 13-week repeat dose rat study. Decreases in male reproductive 
organ (testes, epididymis, prostate, seminal vesicle) weights correlated with histological findings of 
tubular epithelial degenerations, abnormal spermatids and hypospermia. These findings were partially 
reversible at the end of a 24-week recovery period. These findings are consistent with the 
pharmacologic action of microtubule disrupting agents and have been reported with other MMAE 
containing ADCs.

Embryo-foetal development 
The  effect  of  enfortumab vedotin  on  embryo-foetal  development  was  assessed  in  rats  in  2  studies,  a 
pivotal Study with SGN-35 and SGD-1010 (MMAE) and a Study of enfortumab vedotin by intravenous 
injection in rats. 
Repeat-dose  IV  embryo-foetal  development  study  of  SGN-35  and  SGD-1010  (MMAE)in 
pregnant rats (8204937): 
Embryo-foetal development toxicity of SGN-35 and SGD-1010 (MMAE)was evaluated in a GLP-compliant 
study. Time-mated rats (25 + 9 TK/group) were treated IV on GD6 and 13 with vehicle, SGN-35 at 0.3, 
1, 3 or 10 mg/kg or SGN-35 at 0.2 mg/kg. Main study dams were euthanized on GD21, TK dams on 
GD18.  
In rats treated with SGN-35 at 0.3 and 1 mg/kg there were no adverse findings. However, treatment 
with SGN-35 at 3 and 10 mg/kg and SGD-1010 (MMAE)(0.2 mg/kg) resulted in embryo-foetal lethality 
and  treatment-related  effects  in  maternal  clinical  observations,  body  weight  and  food  consumption, 
haematology, uterine weight, macroscopic and microscopic findings (Table 39).  
In rats treated with SGN-35 at 3 and 10 mg/kg, body weights were decreased. This was partly attributed 
to decreases in mean gravid uterus weights in dams correlated with virtual absence (3 mg/kg) or absence 
(10  mg/kg)  of  viable  foetuses.  In  these  dams,  the  uterus  demonstrated  placentation  resorption 
consistent with the reduction or absence of viable foetuses. Pregnancy rates ranged from 96 – 100 %, 
however,  only  2  dams  (3  mg/kg)  had  litters  with  viable  foetuses.  Thus,  total  resorptions/post-
implantation loss was 99.4% and 100 %, and the incidence of dams without viable foetuses was 92 % 
and 100 %, respectively. Regarding foetal development, foetal weight was reduced at 3 mg/kg SGN-35. 
External  malformation  and  foetal  soft  tissue  variations/malformations  were  observed  occasionally  in 
SGN-35-treated  groups.  These  findings  were  considered  unrelated  to  treatment  due  to the  low  foetal 
and litter incidence of the findings.  
Dams treated with 0.2 mg/kg SGD-1010 (MMAE)demonstrated an increase in uterine weights associated 
with viable foetuses, associated with normal placentation and pregnancy-associated vaginal modification 
indicating presence of viable foetuses. In this group, pregnancy rate was 96 %, and all but 1 dam had 
litters with viable foetuses. Thus, post-implantation loss was 27.4 %, and the incidence of dams with no 
viable foetus was 4.2 %. Following treatment with SGD-1010 (MMAE)external malformations, foetal soft 
tissue variations and foetal skeletal variations were observed. These findings were considered unrelated 
to treatment due to the low foetal and litter incidence of the findings.

Table 34 Results for selected Parameters at the Mid and High doses of SGN-35 and the SGD-1010 
dose in a GLP-Compliance Repeat-dose Intravenous Bolus Injection Embryo-Fetal 
Development Study of SGN-35 and SGD-1010 in pregnant Sprague-Dawley 
Rats 
TK analysis revealed that SGN-35, TAb, and SGD-1010 were transferred across the placenta. In dams 
treated with SGN-35, concentrations of SGN-35 were lower in foetal serum than in maternal serum; in 
amniotic fluid SGN-35 concentrations were below the limit of quantitation in the majority of animals. In 
contrast,  SGD-1010  concentrations  were  higher  in  foetal  serum  and  amniotic  fluid  than  in  maternal 
serum where SGD-1010 was generally blow the limit of quantitation. 
In dams treated with SGD-1010, the toxin concentration (Cmax, AUC 0-1d) was higher than in dams 
treated with the antibody-drug conjugate while the residence time of SGD-1010 was shorter. Within 24 
hours SGD-1010 concentrations decreased rapidly. Nevertheless, on GD18 SGD-1010 concentrations in 
amniotic  fluid  and  foetal  serum  were  higher  than  in  maternal  serum  indicating  that  the  toxin  is 
transferred to the foetus.  
The NOAEL of SGN-35 when administered to pregnant rats as 2 weekly IV injections was 1 mg/kg. 
A Preliminary Embryo-Fetal Development Study of Enfortumab Vedotin by Intravenous Injection in Rats 
(study 20119695) 
A GLP study was conducted to provide an evaluation of the effects of enfortumab vedotin on pregnant 
Sprague-Dawley rats and embryo and fetal development from implantation to close of the hard palate 
This study included assessment of fetal survival, body weight, and external and visceral examinations.

This  study  was  designed  to  evaluate  ICH  Harmonised  Tripartite  Guideline  stages  C  to  D  of  the 
reproductive process. 
Enfortumab  vedotin  was  administered  at  dose  levels  of  0  (control  article,  5%  (w/v)  sterile  dextrose 
solution), 2.0, or 5.0 mg/kg per dose via intravenous (bolus) injection to 6 time-mated Sprague-Dawley 
female rats per group. Vehicle or enfortumab vedotin (2.0 or 5.0 mg/kg) was administered once on GD 
6 and again on GD 13 at approximately the same time on each dosing day. 
All  animals  survived  until  the  day  of  scheduled  euthanasia  (GD  21);  however,  enfortumab  vedotin 
administration resulted in maternal and embryo-fetal toxicity at both of the dose levels tested. 
Enfortumab vedotin-related dose–dependent reductions in body weight or body weight gain occurred at 
the 2.0 and 5.0 mg/kg dose. Maternal toxicity at the 2.0 mg/kg per dose level was limited to reductions 
in body weight changes attributed, at least in part, to the embryo-fetal toxicity observed at this dose 
level. Maternal toxicity including reductions in body weight, body weight gain and food consumption that 
occurred at the 5.0 mg/kg dose level was also attributed to embryo/fetal toxicity (total resorption of all 
litters) that occurred in this dose group. 
Prenatal and postnatal development, including maternal function 
Since enfortumab vedotin is intended for the treatment of patients with late stage and advanced 
cancer, studies of fertility and early embryonic development and pre- and postnatal toxicity were not 
conducted. 
Studies in which the offspring (juvenile animals) are dosed and/or further evaluated  
No studies in juvenile animals have been conducted.  
Local Tolerance  
Separate studies evaluating local tolerance of enfortumab vedotin were not performed. 
Histopathological examination of the injection sites occurred as part of the GLP repeat dose toxicology 
studies in both rats and cynomolgus monkeys. The treatment-related effects observed in rats and 
monkeys at or near the injection sites were considered related to the targeting of Nectin-4 which is 
expressed in the epidermis and epithelium of glands in the skin and were reversible at the end of the 
recovery period.

Dedicated non-clinical studies to evaluate the dependence potential of enfortumab vedotin have not been 
conducted. Such studies are not warranted because a) the target is not expressed in central nervous 
system  tissues,  b)  no  CNS  effects  were  noted  in  repeat-dose  toxicology  studies  and  c)  of  the  anti-
microtubule mechanism of action of SGD-1010.  
Metabolites 
The cytotoxic activity of the 3 major metabolites of SGD-1010 (MMAE), C4: O-demethyl-Dap-SGD-1010; 
C7: N-demethyl-Val-SGD-1010; C8: Keto-Nor-SGD-1010, was evaluated in vitro (study TRN-1201-A). 
CD30-positive  tumour  cells  lines  and  primary  human  bone  marrow  CD34-positive  cells  were  used  as 
target cells. Of the 3 metabolites, C8 was as cytotoxic as SGD-1010, while C4 and C7 were less cytotoxic 
against these targets than the parent drug. 
Studies on impurities  
The  test  material  used  in  pivotal  GLP-compliant  non-clinical  studies  was  comparable  or  identical  to 
material  used  in  clinical  studies  and  to  the  intended  marketed  product.  Thus,  all  impurities  were 
adequately assessed and no additional studies are necessary. 
Phototoxicity 
A non-GLP study was performed to evaluate the need for a photosafety assessment of SGD-1006 (vc-
MMAE), SGD-1427 (N-acetylcysteine-vcMMAE), and SGD-1010 (MMAE) (Study TRN-2926-A). 
According to guidance ICH S10, photoreactive potential should be considered if a compound has a 
molar extinction coefficient (MEC) greater than 1000 L mol-1 cm-1 (M-1cm-1) at any wavelength 
between 290 and 700 nm. Absorption spectra were collected for both SGD-1006 and SGD-1427 in 
methanol. For both compounds, the wavelength of maximum absorption over the range of 290 to 700 
nm was determined to be 290 nm. The MEC at this wavelength was calculated from triplicate sample 
preparations. The MEC of SGD-1006 was determined to be 770 M-1cm-1 at 290 nm while the MEC of 
SGD-1427 was determined to be 425 M-1cm-1. Thus, neither SGD-1006 nor SGD-1427 met the 
criteria for phototoxicity testing as defined in ICH S10. A subsequent study conducted on MMAE at 
SAFC (MilliporeSigma) confirmed that the compound has no absorption in the range of 290 to 700 nm 
and, as such, is not considered to pose a direct risk for phototoxicity. 
Other Studies 
Additional mechanistic toxicity studies were performed to better characterize the testicular toxicity 
observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies and to determine if the payload presented any specific effects 
relating to hyperglycaemia.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The procedure for Padcev included an CHMP environmental risk assessment (ERA) file. The risk 
assessment has been carried out according to the EMEA guideline CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr.2 and its Q 
& A document. 
Summary of main study results 
Substance (INN/Invented Name): Enfortumab vedotin 
CAS-number (if available): 1346452-25-2 
PBT-screening: The active ingredient is composed of an antibody linked to MMAE via a 
maleimidocaproyl valine-citrulline linker. The complete active ingredient is due to its mostly protein 
nature not amenable to determination of log Kow. Log Kow for the MMAE part of the molecule which 
is likely one of the excreted moieties, has been determined to be 2.23 at pH 9 and thus below the 
4.5 threshold (see below).

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
Initially, the nonclinical development program of enfortumab vedotin was conducted with the hybridoma 
cell line-derived ADC, AGS-22M6E (HYBRIDOMA ADC). The comparability between enfortumab vedotin 
and  AGS-22M6E  (HYBRIDOMA  ADC)  was  confirmed  also  with  similar  binding  to  the  human  Nectin-4-
expressing  PC3  cells  KD  values  of  0.062  and  0.057  respectively.  Both  AGS-22M6  and  AGS-22M6E 
(HYBRIDOMA ADC) bound to the human, cynomolgus and rat Nectin-4 orthologs with similar affinity.  
Enfortumab  vedotin  binds  to  Nectin-4  on  the  cell  surface  resulting  in  the  internalization  of  the  ADC-
Nectin-4  complex,  which  then  traffics  to  the  lysosomal  compartment  where  MMAE  is  released  via 
proteolytic  cleavage  of  the  linker.  ADC  internalisation  and  co-localization  with  the  lysosomal  marker 
LAMP1  was  demonstrated by  confocal  and  fluorescence  microscopy.  The intracellular  concentration  of 
MMAE delivered by AGS-22C3E was investigated and it was shown that AGS-22C3E delivers MMAE to 
tumor  cells  in  a  Nectin-4  dependent  manner  and  leads  to  disruption  of  microtubules.  AGS-22M6E 
(HYBRIDOMA  ADC)  induced  potent  cytotoxic  effect  in  PC3  cell  lines  engineered  to  express  different 
orthologs of Nectin-4 (human, cynomolgus monkey, rat and mouse), while AGS-22M6 parent antibody 
did not show any cytotoxic effect on these cells in the same assay. The cytotoxic effect against murine 
Nectin-4 expressing cells was lower which may reflect the lower binding affinity. 
The average % relative potency of AGS-22C3E when compared to AGS-22M6E (HYBRIDOMA ADC)  was 
calculated to be 91.4% when tested on PC3-AGS22 cells demonstrating similar potency of the hybridoma 
cell line-derived ADC, AGS-22M6E (HYBRIDOMA ADC)  and Enfortumab vedotin (AGS-22C3E). A newly 
Nectin  4  (AGS-22)  variant  7  was  discovered.  qPCR  data  indicated  that  this  Nectin-4  variant  was 
expressed  in  normal  and  tumour  tissues  at  levels  comparable  to  that  in  the  wild  type.  It  was 
demonstrated that variant-expressing cells were killed in a similar manner as the wild type Nectin 4-
expressing cells.  
Data indicated that Enfortumab vedotin exhibits no ADCC or CDC. It was further shown that enfortumab 
vedotin  has  some  variable  antibody-dependent  cellular  phagocytosis  (ADCP)  activity  in  vitro  which 
depends on the donors of macrophages but also on the mAb/ADC lot used in the assay. It is agreed that 
the effect might be neglected, as the unconjugated antibody shows no efficacy in the tumor xenograft 
models.   
It  was  demonstrated  that  AGS-22C3E  has  in  vitro  bystander  effect  activity  against  Nectin-4  negative 
bladder carcinoma cells when in co-culture with Nectin-4 expressing bladder carcinoma cells.  
The  antitumor  efficacy  of  AGS-22M6E  (HYBRIDOMA  ADC)  was  evaluated  in  a  human  bladder  cancer 
xenograft model at different dosage levels. The primary mechanism is targeted delivery of a cytotoxic 
payload  to  tumour  cells  via  cancer-associated  membrane  receptors.  However,  the  tumour 
microenvironment likely plays a role in ADC penetration, distribution, and processing and thus impacts 
the  overall  antitumor  activity.  The  potential  contribution  of  Fc–FcgR  interactions  between  ADCs  and 
tumour-associated macrophages (TAM) to the preclinical antitumor activities of ADCs was reported and 
demonstrated in xenograft models. The antitumor efficacy of AGS-22M6E (HYBRIDOMA ADC) produced 
in hybridoma cells was compared to AGS-22C3E produced in CHO cells using the AG-Br7 patient-derived 
human  breast  cancer  xenograft  model.  The  tumour  growth  inhibition  caused  by  both  the  hybridoma-
derived and the CHO-derived ADCs was similar. 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies of the ADCs were conducted but hypothetical secondary effects 
of an ADC binding to Nectin-4 were discussed using a review of literature. This is considered sufficient 
when considered in connection with the results of the toxicity studies.

The potential effect of ADC on hERG K+ channels was not evaluated as the antibody component is too 
large to cross plasma membranes. The effect of SGD-1010 (MMAE) on hERG K+ channels, heterologous 
expressed in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK293) cells, was evaluated using the conventional whole cell 
voltage clamp technique. In this assay a block of hERG channel was observed in cells treated with MMAE. 
This  block  was  significantly  different  from  control  values  at  high  concentration  (100  µM)  but  was  not 
large  enough  to  define  an  IC50.  At  100  µM,  the  MMAE  concentration  was  >  19.000x  higher  than  the 
Cmax in patients, which is considered a sufficient safety margin. At 10 µM, the block was not statistically 
different from the controls. No effect was observed on ECG, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory or 
CNS safety pharmacology parameters evaluated as part of the general toxicology studies performed in 
cynomolgus monkeys with the ADC. 
Pharmacodynamic  drug  interactions  of  enfortumab  vedotin  have  not  been  evaluated  in  non-clinical 
studies. The available human data are considered sufficient to evaluate drug-drug-interactions. 
Pharmacokinetics  
The  pharmacokinetics  of  enfortumab  vedotin,  AGS-22M6E  (HYBRIDOMA  ADC)  ,  AGS-22M6 
(unconjugated antibody) or MMAE were not evaluated, but toxicokinetics were evaluated from 4-week 
intravenous dose toxicity studies in rats and/or cynomolgus monkeys after the first and the last dose. 
Immunoassays were developed to measure the antibody components as well as immunogenicity.  
ADC, Tab and ADA concentrations in rat and cynomolgus monkey serum were determined by ELISA. LC-
MS/MS assays were employed to measure circulating amounts of MMAE released from the ADC.  
The analysis for the pharmacokinetic studies appears to be specific, sensitive and linear within the range 
of the specified concentrations. Methods of analysis and validations are sufficiently discussed. Units of 
measurement  are  clearly  defined.  Toxicokinetic  studies  were  conducted  in  compliance  with  GLP.  The 
toxicokinetics  of  AGS-22M6E  (HYBRIDOMA  ADC),  AGS-22M6,  enfortumab  vedotin,  MMAE  and  Tab 
following  intravenous  administration  of  AGS-22M6E  (HYBRIDOMA  ADC)  ,  AGS-22M6  or  enfortumab 
vedotin were evaluated in rats and cynomolgus monkeys. In cynomolgus monkeys, toxicokinetic profiles 
of enfortumab vedotin and AGS-22M6E (HYBRIDOMA ADC) were comparable. The toxicokinetics of MMAE 
following intravenous administration of unconjugated MMAE was also evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys. 
Exposure to AGS-22M6E (HYBRIDOMA ADC) was dose-proportional. No sex differences were observed.  
Tissue  distribution  studies  were  not  performed  for  AGS-22M6E  (HYBRIDOMA  ADC)  or  enfortumab 
vedotin. A high volume of distribution was determined for 3H-MMAE after single dose administration to 
rats. MMAE was well distributed and most tissues had concentrations that were higher than blood from 
0.17 hours through 24 hours post-dose. The plasma protein binding of MMAE was species-dependent, 
with  higher  levels  of  binding  in  rats  and  humans  than  in  mice  and  monkeys.  MMAE  showed  species-
dependent RBC partitioning with positive RBC partitioning in mouse, rat, and cynomolgus monkey blood, 
and negative RBC partitioning in human blood. 
AGS-22C3 is an antibody and is therefore catabolized into small peptides and amino acids. 12 metabolites 
were  identified  in  in  vitro  metabolism  studies  of  MMAE  in  rat,  monkey  and  human  hepatocytes. 
Metabolites formed in human hepatocytes were similar to those formed in rat and monkey hepatocytes. 
The major metabolites C4, C7, and C8 were found to be approximately as cytotoxic (C8) or less cytotoxic 
than MMAE (C4, C7). Incubations with a panel of recombinant human CYP enzymes revealed that CYP3A4 
converted 3H-MMAE to components C4, C7 and C8. CYP2D6 also converted 3H-MMAE to component C7. 
MMAE was metabolized in human liver microsomes primarily by CYP3A4, with minor contribution from 
CYP2D6.  Additional  information  was  obtained  from  clinical  evaluation  of  the  metabolism  of  MMAE  in 
humans following a single intravenous dose of brentuximab vedotin. All detected metabolites, except an 
Assessment report

additional C13 metabolite were previously observed in vitro. C13 was produced via a combination of the 
metabolic pathways of C4 and C8. Altogether, metabolism of MMAE was sufficiently investigated. 
A GLP-compliant mass balance study of MMAE was conducted in rats with another MMAE containing ADC 
(SGN-35) and 3H-MMAE  (SGD-1010). The major route of excretion in rats was via feces with urinary 
excretion accounting for less than 15%. SGD-1010 (MMAE) was the predominant metabolite excreted. 
Intact SGD-1010 (MMAE) was also the primary metabolite excreted in humans dosed with SGN-35 with 
higher excretion in feces than in urine, however, mass balance was not achieved in human studies.  
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions were studied in vitro for different drug transporters and CYP isozymes. 
SGD-1010 (MMAE) was shown to be a substrate for P-gp, but not a potent inhibitor. SGD-1010 (MMAE)  
was  identified  as  a  CYP3A4  substrate.  Therefore,  potent  CYP3A4  inducers  or  inhibitors  may  alter  the 
pharmacokinetics of SGD-1010. SGD-1010 was also shown to be a time-dependent irreversible inhibitor 
of CYP3A4/5, but the inhibition constant is much higher than clinical exposures at Cmax and  CYP3A4 
enzyme  turnover  suggests  complete  regeneration  within  the  dosing  interval.  Therefore,  no  clinical 
interactions should be expected from this irreversible inhibition. Apart from a potential involvement of 
OATPs, pharmacokinetic drug interactions were sufficiently addressed. 
The  Cmax  values  of  MMAE  following  AGS-22M6E  (HYBRIDOMA  ADC)  administration  to  rats  and 
cynomolgus  monkeys  were  approximately  0.2%  and  0.04%  of  peak  AGS-22M6E  (HYBRIDOMA  ADC)  
concentrations respectively, based on molar ratios, which indicates that AGS-22M6E (HYBRIDOMA ADC)  
is  stable  in  plasma  in  vivo.  Regarding  the  stability  of  the  ADC  (AGS-22M6E  (HYBRIDOMA  ADC)  and 
enfortumab  vedotin),  stability  studies  were  conducted  with  the  ADC  in  serum  in  the  ELISA  validation 
[Study AR3905, Study AR4854 and Study 7465-ME-0002]. These quantitation methods capture the ADC 
with the mouse anti-MMAE antibody immobilized on a plate. Study results also confirmed the stability of 
the  ADC  in  human  serum.  The  ADC  was  stable  in  human  serum  for  approximately  24  hours  at  room 
temperature. 
Toxicology  
Repeat  dose  toxicity  studies  were  performed  in  rat  and  cynomolgus  monkey.  Similar  toxicity  profiles 
were observed across species. Skin and bone marrow seem to be the predominant target tissues with 
repeat  dosing  of  both  enfortumab  vedotin  and  AGS-22M6E  (HYBRIDOMA  ADC)  in  both  rats  and 
cynomolgus monkeys. Skin toxicity such as abrasions and/or dry reddened skin was observed in both 
species. Skin lesions were noted in repeat dose studies in rats (4- and 13-weeks) and in monkeys (4-
weeks). The skin changes were fully reversible by the end of a 6 week recovery period (see SmPC 5.3). 
The skin toxicity seen in both rats and cynomolgus monkeys was considered related to expression of 
Nectin-4 in the skin. Bone marrow toxicity was dose limiting in cynomolgus monkeys dosed with MMAE 
alone and seems to be a nontarget-dependent toxicity. There were similar hematologic findings between-
species consistent with bone marrow toxicity. These included changes in parameters in red blood cells 
(RBCs)  indicating  reduced  erythropoiesis.  As  the  toxicity  profiles  seem  to  be comparable  between  rat 
and  cynomolgus,  and  considering  that  cross-reactivity  in  the  rat  and  cynomolgus  monkey  have 
equivalent binding affinity to human Nectin-4, it is acceptable to conduct the chronic (13-week) repeat 
dose toxicity study only in the rat. 
In addition to the skin and bone marrow toxicities, testicular toxicity was observed in the pivotal study 
performed in rats. Additional target organs include epididymis, spleen, eye (cornea), lymphoid tissue, 
adrenal  gland,  Harderian  gland,  intestine,  prostate,  mammary  gland,  and  liver.  AGS-22M6E 
(HYBRIDOMA ADC) AGS-22M6E (HYBRIDOMA ADC). 
The  genotoxic  potential  of  SGD-1010  (MMAE)  was  adequately  evaluated  in  a  standard in  vitro  and in 
vivo test battery. The toxin moiety of the ADC was found to be non-genotoxic in bacterial and mammalian 
cell mutation assays. However, in vivo SGD-1010 (MMAE) induced micronucleus formation in rat bone

marrow  at  a  single  dose  of  0.1  and  0.2  mg/kg.  Micronuclei  were  predominantly  centromere-positive, 
which is consistent with the mode of action of SGD-1010 (MMAE) (see SmPC 5.3). Information on the 
genotoxic activity of the linker was provided based on publicly available data (www.toxnet.org) and in 
silico analysis using the DEREK software. Considering the indication and the expected negligibly low free 
plasma concentrations for the linker and its potential fragments, further qualification was not considered 
necessary. 
As enfortumab vedotin is intended for the treatment of patients with late stage and advanced cancer the 
omission  of  carcinogenicity  studies  is  accepted.  Dedicated  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development 
studies were not conducted in accordance with ICH S9. 
Embryo-fetal development toxicity of SGN-35 and SGD-1010 was evaluated in a GLP-compliant repeat-
dose IV embryo-fetal development study in pregnant rats. Treatment with SGN-35 was associated with 
embryo-fetal lethality. Administration of SGN-35 at 10 mg/kg resulted in greater embryo-fetal toxicity 
than administration of the toxin SGD-1010 at an equivalent molar dose of 0.2 mg/kg. This is likely due 
to the rapid elimination of SGD-1010 from the maternal circulation.  
The embryo-fetal toxicity was appropriately evaluated and the observed findings are correctly reported 
in the SmPC. Enfortumab vedotin associated foetal skeletal variations were considered developmental 
delays. A dose of 2 mg/kg (approximately similar to the exposure at the recommended human dose) 
resulted  in  maternal  toxicity,  embryo-foetal  lethality  and  structural  malformations  that  included 
gastroschisis,  malrotated  hindlimb,  absent  forepaw,  malpositioned  internal  organs  and  fused  cervical 
arch.  Additionally,  skeletal  anomalies  (asymmetric,  fused,  incompletely  ossified,  and  misshapen 
sternebrae,  misshapen  cervical  arch,  and  unilateral  ossification  of  the  thoracic  centra)  and  decreased 
foetal weight were observed (see SmPC 5.3). Since enfortumab vedotin is intended for the treatment of 
patients with late stage and advanced cancer, studies of fertility and early embryonic development and 
pre- and postnatal toxicity were not conducted.  
Separate studies evaluating local tolerance of enfortumab vedotin were not performed. In accordance 
with  ICH  S6,  the  omission  of  dedicated  local  tolerance  studies  is  acceptable.  Histopathological 
examination of the injection sites was performed as part of the GLP repeat dose toxicology studies in 
both rats and cynomolgus monkeys. Increased inflammatory response at injection sites were found and 
are  considered  treatment-related  effects.  Injection  site  reactions  were  reversible  at  the  end  of  the 
recovery period. 
Additional  mechanistic  toxicity  studies  were  performed  to  better  characterize  the  testicular  toxicity 
observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies and to determine if the payload presented any specific effects 
relating to hyperglycemia and phototoxicity. A GLP 4-week study with a 24-week recovery period was 
conducted  to  determine  the  recovery  of  testicular  toxicity  of  enfortumab  vedotin  in  rat.  Repeat  dose 
resulted  in  testicular  toxicity  and  may  alter  male  fertility.  MMAE  has  been  shown  to  have  aneugenic 
properties. Testicular toxicity associated with enfortumab vedotin was partially reversible by the end of 
a 24 week recovery period (see SmPC 5.3). 
Tissue Cross Reactivity studies with of AGS-22M6E-biotin reveal that the ADC cross reacts with a panel 
of normal cynomolgus monkey tissues indicating unspecific cell killing. Positive staining was seen with 
AGS-22M6E-biotin in tissue structures and cell types of epithelial origin within a number of human tissues 
examined.  In  addition,  it  was  found  that  Nectin-4  is  expressed  in  a  variety  of  normal  human  tissues 
during adulthood. It is argued that Nectin-4 is mostly expressed at a low level and the over expression 
of Nectin-4 in human cancers may thus provide a therapeutic window for development of AGS-22M6E as 
a treatment of Nectin-4-expressing cancers.

SGD-1006  and  SGD-1427  were  evaluated  for  potential  phototoxicity  risks  according  to  the  principles 
outlined in ICH S10. Neither compound had absorbance in the range of natural sunlight that exceeded 
the defined threshold for potential phototoxic concern. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
An  adequate  program  of  in  vitro  and  in  vivo  pharmacology  was  conducted  in  disease  models  for 
enfortumab vedotin, supporting the intended clinical use.  
Pharmacokinetics of enfortumab vedotin are well described, and no deficiencies were identified. 
An abbreviated toxicology program was performed, in line with the ICH S6 and ICH S9 guidelines.  
The  SmPC  reflects  the  findings  of  the  toxicity  studies,  as  well  as  the  testicular  toxicity  observed. 
Enfortumab vedotin can cause foetal harm when administered to pregnant women based upon findings 
from  animal  studies.  Embryo  foetal  development  studies  in  female  rats  have  shown  that  intravenous 
administration of enfortumab vedotin resulted in reduced numbers of viable foetuses, reduced litter size, 
and increased early resorptions. It is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of childbearing 
potential  not  using  effective  contraception.  It  is  unknown  whether  enfortumab  vedotin  is  excreted  in 
human  milk.  A  risk  to  breast  fed  children  cannot  be  excluded.  Breastfeeding  should  be  discontinued 
during Padcev treatment and for at least 6 months after the last dose. In rats, repeat dose administration 
of enfortumab vedotin, resulted in testicular toxicity and may alter male fertility. MMAE has been shown 
to have aneugenic properties. Therefore, men being treated with this medicinal product are advised to 
have sperm samples frozen and stored before treatment. There are no data on the effect of Padcev on 
human fertility (see SmPC 4.6).

evaluation is included in this application. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Rationale for the Recommended dose selection 
Selection of the recommended dose of enfortumab vedotin was based on results from the phase 1 clinical 
studies, Study AGS-22M6E-11-1 and Study EV-101. Based on the overall benefit/risk in Study EV-101, 
enfortumab  vedotin  at  1.25  mg/kg  on  days  1,  8  and  15  of  a  28-day  cycle  was  selected  as  the 
recommended phase 2 dose.  This dose of 1.25 mg/kg was  evaluated in subsequent cohorts of Study 
EV-101, Study EV-102, Study EV-201 and Study  EV-301, the pivotal phase 3 study. 
The clinical pharmacology programme assessed the PK, PD, and immunogenicity of enfortumab vedotin, 
in the above listed studies, Table 43.  
Analytical methods 
Serum ADC or enfortumab vedotin (the conjugated monoclonal antibody) was determined with 
validated ELISA assays while free MMAE plasma concentrations (the unconjugated small molecule part 
of the drug) were determined using LC-MS/MS. Serum total antibody (TAb) and nAbs were determined 
using ELISA assays. Immunogenicity was assessed using ELISA or ECLIA assays. The bioanalysis 
conducted in support of enfortumab vedotin is considered well-documented.  
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis was used to assess the impact of covariates on the 
pharmacokinetics of enfortumab vedotin (ADC) and free MMAE. The relationship between enfortumab 
vedotin and free MMAE exposure and efficacy/safety endpoints were explored using model-based 
analysis. A linear mixed effects model was used to assess the relationship between enfortumab vedotin

or MMAE concentration and dQTcF intervals. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models 
were used for evaluation of the DDI potential of enfortumab vedotin and of free MMAE. 
Pop PK models 
A 3-compartment model with first-order elimination and a 2-compartment model with first-order 
elimination and time-varying conversion rate from enfortumab vedotin was used to characterise the 
concentration-time data of enfortumab vedotin and free MMAE, respectively.

The parameters of the final models were estimated with adequate precision. None of the 95% CIs 
contained the null and a high percentage of bootstrap simulations converged successfully indicating the 
models were stable.  
The provided Visual predictive checks (VPCs) for the final population and stratified for different 
influential covariates indicated that both models could describe the observed data. The Goodness of fit 
(GoF) plots did not indicate any major misspecifications.

Sex, baseline albumin, haemoglobin, sum of tumor diameters, analytical lab and manufacturing 
process were identified to be statistically significant covariates for enfortumab vedotin, while sex, 
baseline albumin, haemoglobin, bilirubin, sum of tumor diameters, ECOG performance status, and 
manufacturing process were identified as statistically significant covariates for free MMAE. Effect of 
ADAs and concomitant medication on exposure could not be evaluated due to low sample size. Lower 
albumin levels were associated with higher MMAE exposure. Haemoglobin and to a lesser extent 
bilirubin and ECOG had impact on Ctrough MMAE, which increased with decreasing haemoglobin and 
increasing bilirubin. None of the identified significant covariates had clinically relevant effect on 
exposure.

Model-based MMAE CLM was estimated to be 2.11 L/h and total volume of distribution at steady state to 
be 183.5 L. The elimination half-life was calculated to be 61.2 h (2.6 d). IIV were 43.5 %CV (CLM), 55 
%CV  (VM)  and  62.8%  (VMP),  and  the  corresponding  η-shrinkage  values  ranged  from  5%  to  31%. 
Clearance (CLM) and volume of distributions (VM and VMP) of free MMAE increased with increasing body 
weight. Free MMAE were predicted to have 23% higher CLM, 26% lower VM and 104% higher VMP for 
manufacturing process A. 
The final models of enfortumab vedotin and free MMAE were used to simulate enfortumab vedotin 1.25 
mg/kg exposure (Table 44). 
Table 39  Model-predicted exposures for enfortumab vedotin and free MMAE 
Exposure-response models 
For evaluation of exposure-response relations, cox proportional hazards modeling was used for overall 
survival (OS) data, while logistic regression models were used to model best overall response (BOR) 
and for modelling of selected safety measures. There was no adjustment of prognostic factors. Some 
safety endpoints with low occurrence were also included. Therefore, results should be interpreted with 
caution. 
The relationship between enfortumab vedotin or MMAE concentration and dQTcF intervals was 
assessed using independent linear mixed effects models with time-matched concentration and ECG 
data from study EV-102. ADC showed slight delayed response in ∆QTcF after 3 dosing events (counter 
clock wise hysteresis) with persistent effect even 48 hours post-dose. This is not seen after first dose 
nor for free MMAE. There was also a trend of ∆QTcF increasing with increasing ADC concentration with 
several occurrences of ∆QTcF >20 ms. However, the most pronounced ∆QTcF effect occurred at the 
lower dose 1.0 mg/kg which is unexpected. Antibody drugs are usually not expected to cause QT 
prolongation due to their big size however examples have been published (Oncotarget, 2018, Vol. 9, 
(No. 39), pp: 25738-25749). Only 2 subjects were female.

Figure 26  shows the change from baseline in QTcF (dQTcF) over time 0 to 48 hours after enfortumab 
vedotin intravenous administration for each dose 1 and dose 3 grouped by treatment dose, and a plot 
showing the change from baseline in heart rate (dHR) over time 0 to 48 hours after enfortumab vedotin 
intravenous administration for each dose 1 and dose 3 grouped by treatment dose are presented. Mean 
change from baseline in heart rate at dose 3 on cycle 1 day 15 was about up to 15 bpm and 17 bpm for 
doses of 1.25 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg, respectively (nominal time about 336 h). At 384 h, mean change 
from baseline was about up to 12 bpm to 14 bpm for doses of 1.25 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg, respectively.

PBPK models 
Brentuximab vedotin is an ADC conjugated to MMAE with a similar linker as enfortumab vedotin. The 
impact of ADC on midazolam (CYP3A4 substrate) and the impact of rifampin (CYP3A4 and P-gp 
inducer) and ketoconazole (CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor) on ADC and MMAE have been investigated in a 
published clinical DDI study with brentuximab vedotin [Han TH et al, 2013].

PBPK models were built for brentuximab vedotin and for enfortumab vedotin and verified against 
independent clinical PK data. Both models could reasonably well simulate observed concentration-time 
profiles after single dose and also after multiple dose administrations for enfortumab vedotin.

Predicted effects of brentuximab vedotin on midazolam, rifampin on ADC and MMAE in addition to 
ketoconazole on ADC and MMAE, were comparable to the published observed in terms of mean 
exposure ratios of Cmax and AUC. The brentuximab vedotin model utilized the same MMAE parameters 
as the enfortumab vedotin model.

The product is intended for intravenous administration, bio availability is therefore 100%, and the 
Cmax occurred at the end of infusion. The pharmacokinetic investigations included assessments of 
concentrations of both ADC, MMAE and Total Antibody (TAb).   
Study EV-101 investigated Cmax and AUC in subjects from the target population, (i.e. Part C which 
include subjects with mUC who had been previously treated with a check point inhibitor (CPI) in the 
metastatic setting) (Table 48, Table 49, Table 50)

Distribution 
Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, following a 1.25 mg/kg enfortumab vedotin 
intravenous dose, population mean total volume of distribution at steady state (sum of  volume 
distribution to central and peripheral compartments) was estimated to be 12.8 L.  
Metabolism 
As enfortumab vedotin is a monoclonal antibody, no dedicated drug metabolism studies were 
performed. However, in vitro studies showed that MMAE was metabolized in human liver microsomes 
primarily by CYP3A4, with minor contribution from CYP2D6.  
Elimination 
According to the population PK analysis, the mean clearance of enfortumab vedotin and free MMAE in 
patients was estimated to be 0.110 L/h and 2.11 L/h, respectively.  
Enfortumab vedotin and free MMAE exhibited multi-exponential declines with an elimination half-life of 
3.6 days (87.2 h) and 2.6 days (61.2 h), respectively. 
Based on Non-Compartmental Analysis (NCA) and across the clinical studies estimated half-life ranged 
from 3.04 to 5.19 d.  
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
Study EV-101 investigated pharmacokinetics of  escalating doses of enfortumab vedotin given as 
monotherapy in subjects with metastatic UC and other malignant solid tumours that express Nectin-4 
(part A). Dose-proportionality was demonstrated for ADC, MMAE and Tab, within a dose range of 0,5 
mg/kg – 1.25 mg/kg. Dose proportionality was assessed both after 1st dose, and after 3rd dose. See

Intra- and inter- individual variability 
Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, the model predicted Cycle 1 AUC(0-28d) and Cmax, 
and evaluated for the covariates following: 1.25 mg/kg enfortumab vedotin (capped at 125 mg for 
body weights ≥100 kg) were within 0.85 to 1.27-fold of enfortumab vedotin exposures and 0.79 to 
1.49-fold of free MMAE exposures for the reference population.  The model-predicted Cycle 1 Ctrough 
were within 0.65 to 1.29-fold of enfortumab vedotin exposures and 0.68 to 1.53-fold of free MMAE 
exposures for the reference population.  The range of effects for all the covariates relative to the 
reference population was within the observed variability in the modelling dataset for both analytes.

Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the pharmacokinetics of enfortumab vedotin and MMAE 
were not affected by baseline renal function in subjects with mild, moderate or severe renal function. 
Impaired hepatic function 
Based on population pharmacokinetic analysis, the pharmacokinetics of enfortumab vedotin were not 
affected by baseline hepatic function in subjects with mild hepatic impairment and there was a 37% 
AUC increase in free MMAE exposure in patients with mild hepatic impairment compared to normal 
hepatic function, while exposure to enfortumab vedotin was not  changed.  
The TEAEs observed in patients with mild hepatic impairment in study EV-301 were consistent with 
the  TEAEs observed in patients with normal hepatic function. Thus, no dose adjustments are warranted 
for subjects with mild hepatic impairment. 
Age, gender and race 
The population pharmacokinetic model of enfortumab vedotin included various intrinsic  covariates (i.e., 
age, race, sex and organ impairment).  Though some covariates showed a  difference in exposure, the 
magnitude of changes in exposure are not considered clinically meaningful. 
Weight 
Weight-based dosing with a dose cap of 125 mg for patients ≥100 kg for enfortumab vedotin  was 
supported by population pharmacokinetic modelling and simulation analyses. Although a maximum 
tolerated dose (MTD) for enfortumab vedotin was not identified, a maximum absolute dose limit of 
125 mg  (dose cap) was implemented following the potential treatment related adverse  events 
observed in obese subjects in the Phase 1 Study EV-101.  
Interactions 
Coadministration of CYP3A4 substrates  
Formal drug-drug interaction studies with enfortumab vedotin have not been conducted,  PBPK 
modeling was conducted to predict the drug-drug interaction potential of free MMAE. Based on PBPK 
analysis, concomitant use of enfortumab vedotin is predicted not to affect  exposure to midazolam (a 
sensitive in vivo probe of CYP3A4 activity). 
Coadministration of CYP3A4 Inhibitors 
Based on PBPK analysis, when 1.25 mg/kg of enfortumab vedotin is co-administered with  ketoconazole, 
a combined P-gp and strong CYP3A inhibitor, the geometric mean of Cmax  and  AUCinf  for free MMAE 
is predicted to increase by 15% and 38%, respectively, with no  change in ADC exposure.  
Coadministration of CYP3A4 inducers 
Based on PBPK modeling, when 1.25 mg/kg of enfortumab vedotin was administered with  rifampin, a 
combined  P-gp  and  strong  CYP3A  inducer,  the  Cmax  and  AUClast  for  free  MMAE  were  predicted  to 
decrease by 28% and 53%, respectively, with no change in ADC exposure.  
Immunogenicity 
A total of 590 patients were tested for immunogenicity to enfortumab vedotin 1.25 mg/kg; 15  patients 
were confirmed to be positive at baseline for antitherapeutic antibody (ATA), and in  patients who were 
negative at baseline (N = 575), a total of 16 (2.8%) were positive  postbaseline (13 transiently and 3 
persistently).

Pharmacodynamics  
Mechanism of action  
Enfortumab vedotin is an Antibody Drug conjugated (ADC) comprised of a fully human anti-Nectin-4 
IgG1 kappa monoclonal antibody conjugated to the small molecule microtubule disrupting agent, 
MMAE via a protease-cleavable maleimidocaproyl valine-citrulline (vc) linker. The drug-linker is 
conjugated to the antibody via cysteine residues. The conjugation process results in an ADC product 
with a drug-to-antibody ratio of approximately 3.8. 
Enfortumab vedotin is thought to induce cytotoxicity by ADC binding to Nectin-4 on the surface of 
cells, leading to internalization, proteolytic cleavage of the vc linker and release of MMAE that 
subsequently disrupts tubulin polymerization and leads to mitotic arrest and apoptotic cell death. 
Primary pharmacology 
In the ongoing pivotal EV-301 study, 98% of subjects with evaluable Nectin-4 results had detectable 
(H-score > 0) Nectin-4 by immunohistochemistry (IHC).  In both study arms, Nectin-4 was expressed 
at high levels, as evidenced by high median H-scores of 250 in the enfortumab vedotin arm and 270 in 
the chemotherapy arm, respectively (H-score range: 0 –  300). 
A relationship  between Nectin-4 expression and clinical response was assessed via box plots of 
baseline  Nectin-4 IHC H-scores by best overall response (BOR) category Figure 32  
BOR: best overall response; CR: complete response; FAS: Full Analysis Set; H-score: histoscore; Max:  maximum; Min: minimum;

Secondary pharmacology 
Relationship between PK and QTcF data 
To assess the potential for QTcF interval prolongation, the effect of enfortumab vedotin on the duration 
of cardiac ventricular repolarization was evaluated. Enfortumab vedotin and MMAE concentration-time 
data and ECG data from cycle 1 of phase 1 in study EV-102 were analysed. In this study 17 Japanese 
patients with urothelial cancer were treated with 1.0 mg/kg (n=7) or 1.25 mg/kg (n=8) enfortumab 
vedotin. Blood samples and ECG data were drawn in Cycle 1,Day 1 pre-dose, End of infusion (EOI) , 
0.5, 2, 4 (Day 1), and48 h post EOI (Day 3) and Cycle 1 Day 15 pre-dose, EOI, 0.5, 2, 4 (Day 15), and 
48 h post EOI (Day 17). 
QTc interval was corrected using Fridericia’s formula (QTcF = QT/(RR)1/3). Triplicate QTcF intervals 
were averaged and rounded to the nearest integer prior to analysis. Baseline was defined as the pre-
dose on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1D1) in triplicate. dQTcF intervals were calculated. The relationship between 
enfortumab vedotin or MMAE concentration and dQTcF intervals was assessed using the linear mixed 
effects model with the SAS MIXED procedure. A treatment effect was not included in the model since 
there was no placebo arm in the study. 
Of the 17 patients, 15 were male, and 2 were female. The median age was 67.0 (57 - 82) years, 
weight at baseline was 64.20 (50.3 - 77.6) kg. A total of 157 observations in 17 patients were used for 
this analysis. One patient had a QTcF change from baseline > 30 ms at 2 h and 48 h post EOI during 
cycle 1 day 15 and the safety follow-up visit, respectively. No patients had a QTcF interval > 450 ms or 
a change from baseline > 60 ms. Clinically significant ECG abnormalities were noted in five patients as 
assessed by the investigators; two patients at the screening visit prior to dosing of enfortumab vedotin 
and three patients after enfortumab vedotin administration. 
The dQTcF intervals predicted at the geometric mean Cmax for the dose of 1.25 mg/kg of enfortumab 
vedotin was 20.1 µg/mL and of MMAE 3.94 ng/mL. The tmax of MMAE ranged from 1 to 3 days. Intra-
cycle accumulation for Cmax in cycle 1 was 0.946 for enfortumab vedotin and 1.60 for MMAE at the 1.25 
mg/kg dose. At the 1.0 mg/kg and 1.25 mg/kg, the observed concentrations for enfortumab vedotin 
were 0.0354 - 35.3 µg/mL and for MMAE and 0.0182 - 10.7 ng/mL, respectively. 
A concentration-QTc interval model of dQTcF interval and enfortumab vedotin exposure using the 
linear mixed effects model provided a slope estimate of 0.539 ms/(µg/mL) with 90% CI (-0.0401, 1.12 
ms/(µg/mL) Figure 33. For free MMAE a negative slope of -2.40 ms/(ng/mL) with 90% CI (-6.28, 1.48 
ms/(ng/mL) was estimated. The slope estimates were not statistically significant.

Exposure-response for efficacy 
Cox proportional hazard analysis of exposure-OS relationship in study EV-301 enfortumab vedotin (EV) 
arm and suggested that enfortumab vedotin Cavg was not a statistically significant predictor of OS.  
However, when compared to chemotherapy, all the 4 quartiles of enfortumab vedotin Cavg (median 
OS: 11.0 to 15.2 months) were associated with longer median OS than that of chemotherapy (8.96 
months). Figure 34

Exposure- safety 
The exposure-response analyses established that enfortumab vedotin Cavg was a statistically 
significant positive predictor for the probability of drug-related TEAEs Grade ≥ 3, TEAEs leading to dose 
adjustment, rash or severe cutaneous adverse reaction Grade ≥ 3, peripheral neuropathy Grade ≥ 2, 
and any hyperglycaemia Grade ≥ 3. The increase in enfortumab vedotin Cavg was associated with 
increase in the probability of these adverse events. 
Free MMAE exposure was also identified as a statistically significant  predictor for all the adverse events 
in the exposure-safety modeling except for any  hyperglycaemia Grade ≥ 3.  Increase in free MMAE 
Cavg  was associated with increase of  probability of drug-related TEAEs Grade ≥ 3, TEAEs leading to 
dose adjustment and rash or  severe cutaneous adverse reaction Grade ≥ 3, while with decreased 
probability of peripheral  neuropathy Grade ≥ 2. 
Overall, despite these relationships between enfortumab vedotin exposure and  reported safety 
outcomes, treatment with 1.25 mg/kg enfortumab vedotin was generally well  tolerated with a 
manageable safety profile in patients with advanced urothelial cancer. 
Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Serum  of  enfortumab  vedotin  (the  conjugated  monoclonal  antibody)(ADC)  was  determined  with 
validated ELISA assays. Free MMAE plasma concentrations (the unconjugated small molecule part of the 
drug) were determined using LC-MS/MS. Serum total antibody (TAb) and nAbs were determined using 
ELISA assays and Immunogenicity was tested by ELISA or ECLIA assays.  
A  3-compartment  model  with  first-order  elimination  and  a  2-compartment  model  with  first-order 
elimination  and  time-varying  conversion  rate  from  enfortumab  vedotin  was  used  to  characterize  the 
Assessment report

concentration-time data of enfortumab vedotin and free MMAE, respectively. No target-mediated drug 
disposition model (TMDD) was tested during the model development procedure. Enfortumab vedotin and 
MMAE were not modelled in a combined model. Overall, the model for enfortumab vedotin seem able to 
describe the general trend of the concentration-time profiles. For MMAE, an under-prediction of the highly 
variable concentrations can be observed, in particular after the first dose, while this trend is reduced 
after the third dose. As the high variability of MMAE concentrations seems not to be captured very good 
by  the  model,  the  model-based  assumptions  for  pharmacokinetics  and  dose/exposure-response,  in 
particularly for MMAE, should be interpreted with caution. While different manufacturing processes lead 
to minor differences in exposure for enfortumab vedotin and free MMAE, the potential reasons for the 
observed differences remain unclear. Lower albumin levels were associated with higher MMAE exposure. 
Exposure-Response relations used cox proportional hazards modeling for overall survival (OS) data, and  
logistic regression models for best overall response (BOR) and for selected safety measures.  
The effect of enfortumab vedotin and MMAE on QTc was best described by a linear model, indicating no 
general trend for an increased ΔQTcF with concentration. 
No clinical DDI studies have been conducted. Physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models for 
both enfortumab vedotin and MMAE were used to assess potential DDI. A PBPK model was developed 
for  brentuximab  vedotin  which  is  an  ADC  with  MMAE  and  similar  linker.  Clinical  DDI  data  for  this 
compound were used to verify the brentuximab vedotin DDI model and to bridge to enfortumab vedotin. 
The PBPK model showed some limitations in the quantitative predictions which were considered minor in 
view of the overall weight of evidence supporting limited clinical impact in the population indicated for 
treatment.  Concomitant  use  of  enfortumab  vedotin  with  ketoconazole  (a  combined  P  gp  and  strong 
CYP3A inhibitor) is predicted to increase unconjugated MMAE Cmax and AUCexposure to a minor extent, 
with no change in ADC exposure. Concomitant use of enfortumab vedotin with rifampin (a combined P 
gp  and  strong  CYP3A  inducer)  is  predicted to  decrease  unconjugated  MMAE  Cmax  and  AUC  exposure 
with moderate effect, with no change in ADC exposure. The full impact of rifampin on the Cmax of MMAE 
may be underestimated in the PBPK model. Concomitant use of enfortumab vedotin is predicted not to 
affect exposure to midazolam (a sensitive CYP3A substrate) (see SmPC 5.2). 
Five  clinical  studies  form  the  basis  of  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  enfortumab  vedotin:  3  phase  1 
studies (Study AGS-22M6E-11-1, Study EV-101, and Study EV-102) one phase 2 study (Study EV-201, 
Cohorts 1 and 2) and a pivotal phase 3 study (EV-301).  
Overall, the submitted pharmacology package describes the pharmacokinetic of enfortumab vedotin in 
details. 
Based on these studies, a recommended dose selection of 1.25 mg/kg on days  1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day 
cycle was determined. 
The effect of renal impairment has been appropriately investigated. The pharmacokinetics of ADC and 
unconjugated  MMAE  were  evaluated  after  the  administration  of  1.25 mg/kg  of  enfortumab  vedotin  to 
patients with mild (CrCL >60–90 mL/min; n=272), moderate (CrCL 30–60 mL/min; n=315) and severe 
(CrCL 15–<30 mL/min; n=25) renal impairment. No significant differences in AUC exposure of ADC or 
unconjugated  MMAE  were  observed  in  patients  with  mild,  moderate  or  severe  renal  impairment 
compared to patients with normal renal function. Enfortumab vedotin has not been evaluated in patients 
with end stage renal disease (CrCL <15 mL/min) (see SmPC 5.2). 
As  for  hepatic  impairment,  only  data  from  patients  with  mild  impairment  are  available.  Based  on 
population  pharmacokinetics  analysis  using  data  from  clinical  studies  in  patients  with  metastatic  UC, 
there was no significant differences in ADC exposure and a 37% increase in unconjugated MMAE AUC 
were observed in patients with mild hepatic impairment (total bilirubin of 1 to 1.5 × ULN and AST any, 
or total bilirubin ≤ ULN and AST > ULN, n=65) compared to patients with normal hepatic function.  Weight

over 125 kg included in the pop PK analysis, and in one clinical study, was shown to increase the risk of 
adverse events. Enfortumab vedotin has only been studied in a limited number of patients with moderate 
hepatic impairment (n=3). The effect of moderate or severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >1.5 x 
ULN  and  AST  any)  or  liver  transplantation  on  the  pharmacokinetics  of  ADC  or  unconjugated  MMAE  is 
unknown.  
Concomitant administration of enfortumab vedotin and a CYP3A4 metabolised drug, did not show clinically 
relevant risk of inducing pharmacokinetic interactions.  
No  standalone  pharmacodynamic  studies  have  been  performed  which  is  in  accordance  with  the  EMA 
guideline on therapeutic proteins (CHMP/EWP/89249/2004) and thus acceptable. However, one clinical 
study has investigated whether use of enfortumab vedotin increases the risk of QTc prolongation (Study 
EV-102). 
Study EV-102, investigating the relationship between antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) and MMAE 
concentrations and the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to Fridericia’s formula (QTcF) and 
assessing the potential for QT prolongation, indicated that, at the recommended dose of 1.25 mg/kg, 
enfortumab vedotin had no large effect on QTc prolongation (>20 msec). 
A relationship between Nectin-4 expression and clinical response has been investigated in Study EV-301 
and is presented and discussed in the Efficacy section below. 
Exposure-response relationship between clinically relevant concentrations of enfortumab vedotin, and free 
MMAE and the risk of adverse events were investigated in Study EV-301. The results showed that  the 
increase in enfortumab vedotin Cavg, and free MMAE was associated with increase in the probability of 
adverse events. In general, these adverse events were well tolerated, and the safety was manageable.  
Relationship  between  exposure  and  efficacy  was  investigated  in  Study  EV-301.    Kaplan-Meier  Curves 
showing overall survival (OS) of Enfortumab Vedotin and free  MMAE exposure quartiles in Study EV-301 
were presented. Compared to chemotherapy, all 4 quartiles of enfortumab vedotin Cavg (median OS: 
11.0 to 15.2 months) were associated with longer median OS than that of chemotherapy (8.96 months). 
This is considered to be of clinically relevance, and it shows a relationship between exposure and efficacy. 
However,free MMAE Cavg  was identified as a statistically  significant negative predictor for OS in Study 
EV-301 and for best overall response (BOR) in Study EV-201  Cohort 2.  
The reason for this relationship with MMAE seems unknown. Multiple confounding disease factors may 
have negatively impacted both exposure  and response, as reported for other biologics [Wang et al, 2017; 
Kagedal et al, 2017; Li et al,  2017; Turner et al, 2018].  
Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology programme consists of five clinical studies, a pop PK analysis, and a PBPK 
analysis 
The mean estimate of steady state volume of distribution of ADC was 12.8 L following 1.25 mg/kg of 
enfortumab vedotin. In vitro, the binding of MMAE to human plasma proteins ranged from 68% to 
82%. MMAE is not likely to displace or to be displaced by highly protein bound medicinal products. In 
vitro studies indicate that MMAE is a substrate of P glycoprotein. A small fraction of MMAE released 
from enfortumab vedotin is metabolised. In vitro data indicate that the metabolism of MMAE occurs 
primarily via oxidation by CYP3A4. The mean clearance of ADC and unconjugated MMAE in patients 
was 0.11 L/h and 2.11 L/h, respectively. ADC elimination exhibited a multi exponential decline with a 
half life of 3.6 days. Elimination of MMAE appeared to be limited by its rate of release from enfortumab 
vedotin. MMAE elimination exhibited a multi exponential decline with a half-life of 2.6 days. The 
excretion of MMAE occurs mainly in faeces with a smaller proportion in urine. After a single dose of 
another ADC that contained MMAE, approximately 24% of the total MMAE administered was recovered

in faeces and urine as unchanged MMAE over a 1 week period. The majority of recovered MMAE was 
excreted in faeces (72%). A similar excretion profile is expected for MMAE after enfortumab vedotin 
administration. Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that age [range: 24 to 90 years; 60% 
(450/748) >65 years, 19% (143/748) >75 years, race [69% (519/748) White, 21% (158/748) Asian, 
1% (10/748) Black and 8% (61/748) others or unknown] and gender [73% (544/748) male] do not 
have a clinically meaningful effect on the pharmacokinetics of enfortumab vedotin (see SmPC 5.2).In 
conclusion, the pharmacology package is considered adequate and the proposed dosing of enfortumab 
vedotin is considered appropriate.

2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Rationale for the Recommended dose selection 
Selection of the recommended dose of enfortumab vedotin was based on results from phase 1 clinical 
studies, Study AGS-22M6E-11-1 and Study EV-101. Based on the overall benefit/risk in Study EV-101, 
enfortumab vedotin at 1.25 mg/kg on days  1, 8 and 15 of a 28-day cycle was selected as the 
recommended for subsequent studies: Study EV-102, Study EV-201 and the pivotal study (Study  EV-
301). 
2.5.2.  Main study 
Study EV-301 (7465-CL-0301) is a global, open-label, randomised phase III study in adult subjects 
with locally advanced or mUC who had received a platinum-containing chemotherapy and had 
experienced disease progression or relapse during or following treatment with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors.  
Figure 30: EV-301 study scheme 
Approximately 600 subjects were to be randomized to enfortumab vedotin (Arm A) or chemotherapy 
(Arm B) in a 1:1 ratio.  
Subjects started with cycle 1 and continued on to subsequent 21-day (Arm B) or 28-day (Arm A) 
cycles until one of the discontinuation criteria were met or upon study termination, or study 
completion, whichever occurred first.  
Subjects were evaluated for response based on investigator assessment according to RECIST v1.1. 
Imaging for both arms was performed at baseline and every 56 days (± 7 days) from the first dose of 
study treatment throughout the study until PFS1 was documented by radiological disease progression 
or the subject was lost to follow-up, died, withdrew study consent or started a subsequent anticancer 
therapy. 
Following PFS1, subjects entered the long-term follow-up period and were followed per institutional 
guidelines but not less than every 3 months from the date of the follow-up visit for survival status and 
progression status on subsequent therapy (i.e., PFS2). 
Vinflunine cap: Within the control arm, the overall proportion of subjects receiving vinflunine was to be 
capped at approximately 35%. After vinflunine cap was reached, subjects who had received both 
docetaxel and paclitaxel were to be excluded.

Methods 
Study Participants 
 Key inclusion criteria: 
1.  Subject had histologically or cytologically confirmed urothelial carcinoma (i.e., cancer of the 
bladder, renal pelvis, ureter or urethra). Subjects with urothelial carcinoma (transitional cell) with 
squamous differentiation or mixed cell types were eligible. 
2.  Subject must have experienced radiographic progression or relapse during or after a CPI (anti-PD-1 
or anti-PD-L1) for locally advanced or metastatic disease. Subjects who discontinued CPI treatment 
because of toxicity were eligible provided that they had evidence of disease progression following 
discontinuation. The CPI need not have been the most recent therapy. Subjects for whom the most 
recent therapy had been a non-CPI based regimen were eligible if they had progressed/relapsed 
during or after their most recent therapy. Locally advanced disease must not have been amenable 
to resection with curative intent per the treating physician. 
3.  Subject must have received a platinum-containing regimen (cisplatin or carboplatin) in the 
metastatic/locally advanced, neoadjuvant or adjuvant setting. If platinum was administered in the 
adjuvant/neoadjuvant setting, the subject must have progressed within 12 months of completion. 
4.  Subject had radiologically documented metastatic or locally advanced disease at baseline. 
5.  An archival tumour tissue sample was to have been available for submission to central laboratory 
prior to study treatment. If an archival tumour tissue sample was not available, a fresh tissue 
sample was to have been provided. If a fresh tissue sample could not be provided because of safety 
concerns, enrolment into the study was to have been discussed with the medical monitor. 
6.  Subject had ECOG PS of 0 or 1. 
7.  Adequate hematologic and end-organ function, as defined by laboratory results. 
Key exclusion criteria: 
1.   Subject had pre-existing sensory or motor neuropathy Grade ≥ 2. 
2.   Subject had active central nervous system (CNS) metastases. Subjects with treated CNS 
metastases were permitted on study if the metastases had been clinically stable for at least 6 
weeks prior to screening;. 
3.   Subject had ongoing clinically significant toxicity (≥ Grade 2 with the exception of alopecia) 
associated with prior treatment (including systemic therapy, radiotherapy or surgery). Subject 
with ≤ Grade 2 immunotherapy-related hypothyroidism or panhypopituitarism may have been 
enrolled when well-maintained/controlled on a stable dose of hormone replacement therapy (if 
indicated). Subjects with ongoing ≥ Grade 3 immunotherapy-related hypothyroidism or 
panhypopituitarism were excluded. Subjects with ongoing immunotherapy related colitis, uveitis, 
myocarditis, or pneumonitis or subjects with other immunotherapy related AEs requiring high 
doses of steroids (> 20 mg/day of prednisone or equivalent) were excluded. 
4.   Subject had received prior chemotherapy for UC with all available study therapies in the control 
arm (i.e., both prior paclitaxel and docetaxel in regions where vinflunine is not an approved 
therapy, or prior paclitaxel, docetaxel and vinflunine in regions where vinflunine is an approved 
therapy). 
Assessment report  
EMA/249357/2022 
Page 96/188 
 
 
 
 
6.   Subject had received more than 1 prior chemotherapy regimen for locally advanced or mUC, 
including chemotherapy for adjuvant or neo-adjuvant disease if recurrence had occurred within 12 
months of completing therapy. The substitution of carboplatin for cisplatin was not to constitute a 
new regimen provided no new chemotherapeutic agents had been added to the regimen. 
7.   Subject had history of another malignancy within 3 years before the first dose of study drug, or 
any evidence of residual disease from a previously diagnosed malignancy. Subjects with 
nonmelanoma skin cancer, localized prostate cancer treated with curative intent with no evidence 
of progression, low-risk or very low-risk (per standard guidelines) localized prostate cancer under 
active surveillance/watchful waiting without intent to treat, or carcinoma in situ of any type (if 
complete resection was performed) were allowed. 
8.   Subject had known active hepatitis B, active hepatitis C or known history of HIV infection. 
9.   Subject had documented history of a cerebral vascular event (stroke or transient ischemic attack), 
unstable angina, myocardial infarction, or cardiac symptoms (including congestive heart failure) 
consistent with New York Heart Association Class III-IV within 6 months prior to the first dose of 
study drug. 
10.  Subject has radiotherapy or major surgery within 4 weeks prior to first dose of study drug or 
chemotherapy, biologics, investigational agents, and/or antitumor treatment with immunotherapy 
that is not completed 2 weeks prior to first dose of study drug. 
11.  Subject has had chemotherapy, biologics, investigational agents, and/or antitumor treatment with 
immunotherapy that is not completed 2 weeks prior to first dose of study drug. 
12.  Subject has known active keratitis or corneal ulcerations. Subject with superficial punctate 
keratitis is allowed if the disorder is being adequately treated in the opinion of the investigator. 
13.  History of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus within 3 months of the first dose of study drug. 
Uncontrolled diabetes is defined as haemoglobin A1C (HbA1c) ≥ 8% or HbA1c between 7 and < 
8% with associated diabetes symptoms (polyuria or polydipsia) that are not otherwise explained. 
Treatments 
Enfortumab vedotin (EV) was administered at a dose of 1.25 mg/kg as an intravenous infusion over 
approximately 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 28-day cycle. 
Dose reduction to 1 mg/kg (a reduction of 1 dose level [to dose level – 1]) and to 0.75 mg/kg (a 
reduction of 2 dose levels [to dose level – 2]) was allowed depending on the type and severity of 
toxicity. Subjects requiring a dose reduction could be re-escalated by 1 dose level (i.e., subjects 
reduced to 0.75 mg/kg may only have been re-escalated to 1 mg/kg) provided the toxicity did not 
require study drug discontinuation and had returned to baseline or ≤ Grade 1. If the toxicity recurred, 
re-escalation was not permitted. Subjects with ≥ Grade 2 corneal AEs were not permitted to dose re-
escalate. 
Docetaxel was administered at 75 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion on day 1 of every 21-day cycle. 
All subjects were to have been premedicated per local standard of care with corticosteroids. 
Paclitaxel was administered at 175 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion on day 1 of every 21-day cycle. 
All subjects were to have been premedicated prior to paclitaxel administration in order to prevent 
severe hypersensitivity reactions. 
Vinflunine was administered at 320 mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion on day 1 of every 21-day cycle.  
Assessment report  
EMA/249357/2022 
Page 97/188 
 
 
 
 
In general, treatment with the chemotherapy comparators (docetaxel, paclitaxel or vinflunine) was to 
have been withheld for drug-related Grade 4 hematologic toxicities and for nonhematologic toxicity ≥ 
Grade 3, and subsequent doses modified as per the protocol. Dose modifications were applied for all 
subsequent doses. Specific dose modification guidance for docetaxel, vinflunine and paclitaxel can be 
found in the protocol. 
Crossover: No on-study crossover was allowed in the first three versions of the protocol. However, as 
of Amendment 3 (protocol version 4.0, 14-SEP-2020), a crossover extension study was implemented 
since the interim analysis resulted in a positive outcome: eligible Arm B subjects could be evaluated for 
eligibility for cross-over to EV treatment at the discretion of the subject and investigator. 
Subjects assigned to the chemotherapy arm were not allowed to switch to a different chemotherapy 
treatment during study treatment. 
Objectives 
The Primary objective was: 
To compare the OS of subjects with locally advanced or mUC treated with enfortumab vedotin to the 
OS of subjects treated with chemotherapy.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was: 
OS, defined as the time from the date of randomisation until the documented date of death from any 
cause. All events of death on or prior to analysis cut-off date will be included, regardless of whether 
the event occurred while the subject is still taking study drug or after the subject discontinue study 
drug.  
Secondary endpoints were: 
PFS1, defined as the time from the date of randomization until the date of documented radiological 
disease progression per investigator based on RECIST V1.1, or until death due to any cause, whichever 
occurs first.  
Overall response rate (ORR), defined as the proportion of subjects with best overall response (BOR) as 
confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR), per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by 
investigator.  
DOR, defined as the time from the date of the first CR/PR (whichever is first recorded) that is 
subsequently confirmed as assessed by investigator to the date of documented disease progression or 
death due to any cause whichever occurs first.  
Disease control rate (DCR), defined as the proportion of subjects with BOR of confirmed CR or 
confirmed PR or SD, per RECIST v1.1 as assessed by investigator.  
Exploratory efficacy endpoints 
Biomarkers: Nectin-4 and PD-L1 expression in tissue were tested using screening/baseline tumour 
tissue sample. Nectin-4 expression in tissue were assessed by IHC H-score. PD-L1 expression in tissue 
were assessed by IHC combined positive score (CPS) with validated IHC assay with monoclonal mouse 
anti-PD-L1, clone 22C3. Subjects may have also been tested for PD-L1 expression prior to enrolment 
and these PD-L1 test results (i.e., prior PD-L1 testing) were collected when available. 
PFS in the next line of therapy (PFS2),defined as the time from randomization to subsequent disease 
progression after initiation of new anti-cancer therapy, or death from any cause, whichever occurs 
first.  
Sample size 
Sample size was determined by primary endpoint OS. Assuming HR = 0.75 (median OS in Arm A and 
Arm B were 10.7 months and 8 months, respectively), drop-out rate of 10%, the final analysis at the 
planned 439 death events and 1 interim analysis at 65% of the total planned events (285 death 
events), this sample size will provide 85% power to detect a statistically significant difference at 
overall type I error rate of 1-sided 0.025. 
The planned sample size will provide more than 90% power to detect statistically significant differences 
on selected secondary endpoints: PFS1 (assuming median PFS1 in Arm A and Arm B are 6 months and 
4 months, respectively), ORR and DCR (assuming 15% treatment difference between Arm A and Arm B 
for both ORR and DCR). 
Following these calculations, approximately 600 subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 2 
treatment arms: EV (Arm A) and chemotherapy (Arm B). 
Assessment report  
EMA/249357/2022 
Page 99/188 
 
 
 
 
Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Subjects randomisation l occurred centrally through Interactive Response Technology (IRT). There 
were two treatment arms. Subjects were assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to Arm A (EV) OR Arm B 
(investigator’s choice of paclitaxel, docetaxel or vinflunine). Investigators must have selected one 
treatment among the Arm B options before randomization occurred, to use in the event that the 
subject is randomized to the Arm B. Within the control arm (Arm B), the overall proportion of subjects 
receiving vinflunine was capped at approximately 35%. 
Randomisation was stratified according to the following factors: 
(1) ECOG PS: 0 vs. 1 
(2) Region of the world: Western EU vs. US vs. Rest of World 
(3) Liver metastasis status: Yes vs. No 
Statistical methods 
Study population: The full analysis set (FAS) consists of all subjects who were randomized. This 
analysis set was in compliance with the ITT principle that includes all randomized subjects, the FAS 
was equivalent to the ITT population. The FAS was the primary analysis set for efficacy analyses 
except for response related efficacy endpoints. Demographic and baseline characteristics were 
summarized for the FAS. The response evaluable set (RES) was defined as all subjects in FAS who 
have measurable disease (per RECIST V1.1) per investigator at baseline. RES was used for primary 
efficacy analysis of response related endpoints, e.g., ORR and DCR. 
Primary endpoint – OS: The distribution of OS was estimated for each treatment arm using Kaplan-
Meier methodology and the primary analysis on comparing Arm A and Arm B was conducted using the 
log-rank test stratified by ECOG PS (0 vs. 1), region (US, EU and the Rest of world) and liver 
metastasis status (Yes vs. No) per IRT. In addition, stratified Cox proportional hazard model (same 
stratification factors as used for stratified log-rank test) was used to estimate the hazard ratio and the 
corresponding 95% confidence interval. Comparison of Arm A (EV) and Arm B (Chemotherapies) was 
tested at a planned interim analysis and the final (primary) analysis. 
Censoring rules for OS: All events of death on or prior to analysis cutoff date were to be included, 
regardless of whether the event occurred while the subject was still taking study drug or after the 
subject discontinue study drug. Subjects who were still alive at the time of data cutoff date were 
censored at the last known alive date or at the analysis cutoff date, whichever was earlier. Subjects 
with death or last known alive date after the analysis cutoff date were censored at the analysis cutoff 
date.  
Sensitivity analyses for OS: OS analyses based on unstratified log-rank test were performed to assess 
imbalance in the use of subsequent anti-cancer therapy (including subsequent use of EV) and  
to assess potential COVID-19 impact.  
Secondary endpoint – investigator-based PFS1:  
The distribution of PFS1 was estimated for each treatment arm using Kaplan-Meier methodology and 
compared between Arm A and Arm B using log-rank test stratified by ECOG PS (0 and 1), region (US, 
EU and the Rest of world) and liver metastasis status (Yes vs. No) per IRT. In addition, stratified Cox 
Assessment report

proportional hazard model was used to estimate the hazard ratio and the corresponding 95% 
confidence interval. 
Censoring rules for investigator-based PFS1 
Table 51 Censoring rules  
Sensitivity analysis for investigator-based PFS1 
• 
PFS1 analysis based on unstratified log-rank test 
•  Sensitivity analysis on FAS when removing the censoring of PD or death events occurred after 
missing 2 consecutive tumour assessments. 
• 
To assess potential COVID-19 impact, below sensitivity analyses maybe conducted: 
o  Same as OS primary analysis, except that subjects died due to COVID-19 infection will 
be censored at the death date. 
o  Same as OS primary analysis, but exclude the subjects died due to COVID-19 infection 
from the analysis. 
Secondary endpoint – ORR: The comparison of ORR between Arm A and Arm B was performed using 
stratified CMH test. The primary analysis was performed on RES. In addition, ORR for each arm was 
estimated and corresponding 95% confidence interval was constructed. 
Secondary endpoint – DCR: The comparison of DCR between Arm A and Arm B was performed using 
stratified CMH test. In addition, DCR for each arm was estimated and corresponding 95% confidence 
interval was constructed. 
Subgroup analyses: In order to determine whether the treatment effect was consistent across various 
subgroups, the estimate of the between-group treatment effect (with a nominal 95% CI) for OS, PFS1 
and ORR were estimated and plotted within each category of the following classification variables: age, 
sex, region, ECOG PS, liver metastases, pre-selected control therapy by INV,  primary site of tumour, 
prior lines of systemic therapy, and best response to CPI. 
Changes to study design and planned analyses 
Several changes to the design and statistical methods were done while the study was ongoing, as part 
Assessment report

of protocol amendments and SAP revisions. Details and justification regarding the main update to EV-
301  study  design,  represented  by  the  increase  in  sample  size  and  targeted  number  of  deaths,  were 
provided.  This  increase  was  related  to  an  increase  in  power  (from  80  to  85%),  and  interim  and 
multiplicity decision rules were adapted accordingly. These updates were introduced as part of protocol 
amendment 2 which was finalized on 11-DEC-2019. An OS analysis according to the original protocol 
plan for the interim analysis, i.e. based on the first 250 death events was also provided.  
Multiplicity Adjustment: 
The family-wise type I error rate for this study was strongly controlled at 2.5% (one -sided) that allows 
the study to declare positive on primary endpoint OS on the FAS population. OS was formally tested at 
both the interim analysis and final analysis according to the O’Brien-Fleming boundary per Lan and 
DeMets method.  
Formal hypothesis testings on the selected secondary endpoints including PFS1, ORR and DCR, were 
performed hierarchically (per the order of PFS1-> ORR->DCR) only when the OS testing result was 
rejected. PFS1was planned to test at either the interim analysis or final analysis when OS was rejected. 
The significance level of PFS1 at the interim and final analysis was based on Pocock boundary per Lan 
and DeMets method. ORR and DCR were tested only once after both OS and PFS1 were rejected (at 
either IA or FA) and the test statistics was computed from the interim data. The significance level of 
both ORR and DCR were 0.025. DCR was to be tested after ORR was rejected.

Results 
Participant flow 
From 27-JUN- 2018 to 15-JUL-2020 (the study data cutoff date), a total of 745 subjects gave informed 
consent to be enrolled in the study. A total of 608 subjects were randomized from 02-JUL-2018 to 17-
JAN-2020. Of the 608 randomized subjects, 587 subjects (296 subjects in the enfortumab vedotin arm 
and 291 subjects in the chemotherapy arm) received study drug. 
Out of the 291 subjects that received treatment in the chemotherapy arm, 109 (37%) received 
docetaxel, 107 (37%) paclitaxel and 75 (26%) vinflunine.

Conduct of the study 
The original protocol for EV-301 was dated 20-DEC-2017. There were 3 substantial amendments to the 
protocol.  
Substantial amendment 1 (Protocol V2.0, 22-AUG-2018) 
Whiting the 17 substantial amendments the following are considered clinically relevant: 
o  Update of the exclusion criteria  
o  Revision of the criteria detailing when imaging assessments every 56 days (± 7 days) were to end 
in the post-treatment follow-up period.  Revision was done to be consistent with on treatment 
follow-up for PFS1. To evaluate the impact on missing visits, additional sensitivity analysis on PFS1 
was to be conducted. 
o  Inclusion and definition of a new analysis set (response evaluable set [RES]) to use for efficacy 
analysis on ORR and DCR. Efficacy analysis on OS and PFS was to be conducted on the full analysis 
set. The pharmacodynamics analysis set was removed. The efficacy variables to be tested (only OS, 
PFS1, ORR and DCR) were stated formally and the multiplicity adjustment rule was included. 
o  Text was added to indicate that additional sensitivity analyses was to be performed for PFS1 for 
subjects censored when missing 2 consecutive tumour visits 
For the subgroup analyses, 1 subgroup (burden of disease at baseline) was removed and existing 
subgroups (prior platinum, setting of most recent prior chemotherapy, histology, time from 
completion/discontinuation of most recent platinum-based prior therapy and the primary site of 
tumour) were clarified. Substantial amendment 2 (Protocol version 3.0, 11-DEC-2019) 
o  The number of death events at the final analysis was increased from 384 to 439 to rise the power of 
the study from 80% to 85%, and to ensure sufficient statistical power for final analysis and 
increased the total number of subjects to be randomized from 550 to 600; this was associated with 
the aforementioned increase in the number of death events and to maintain the analysis timeline. It 
also increased the number of death events for the planned interim efficacy analysis from at least 
250 to 285 OS events (about 65% of the total planned events). 
o  Duration of treatment was amended and the text in bold was added: Subjects will continue to 
receive study treatment until radiological disease progression as determined per investigator 
Assessment report  
EMA/249357/2022 
Page 104/188 
 
 
 
 
 
 
assessment or other discontinuation criteria are met or upon study termination, or study 
completion, whichever occurs first. No on-study crossover will be allowed. 
Substantial amendment 3 (Protocol version 4.0, 14-SEP-2020) 
o  A crossover extension (COE) was added to the study design. Upon decision to stop the study for 
efficacy based on statistically significant OS result favouring EV, all eligible Arm B subjects could be 
evaluated for eligibility for COE EV treatment at the discretion of the subject and investigator. 
Treatment with EV would be stopped upon disease progression and/or when discontinuation criteria 
were met. Arm B Subjects who did not participate in the COE would continue to follow Arm B 
protocol procedures.

An additional dataset with data cut-off 30-JUL-2020, composed of subjects with available tissue 
samples for nectin-4 analysis, was provided during the procedure. This dataset included 15 additional 
tissue samples which increased the number of biomarker-available subjects for the final OS analysis to 
542 (n=274 in EV arm and n=268 in chemotherapy arm).

In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for efficacy  
Nectin-4 expression in tumour specimens was measured retrospectively by immunohistochemistry (IHC) 
using an analytically validated assay. Nectin-4 expression was reported using the IHC H-score ranging 
from 0 to 300, which combined percentage of positive tumour cells and intensity of expression of Nectin-
4.  Across  enfortumab  vedotin  clinical  studies,  IHC  assay  results  have  confirmed  Nectin-4  is  highly 
prevalent in urothelial carcinoma (i.e., expressed in over 96% of urothelial carcinoma patients).  
Nectin-4 assay analytical method 
Assessment report  
EMA/249357/2022 
Page 117/188 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Nectin-4 assay was developed as a semiquantitative IHC assay of Nectin-4 in formalin-fixed paraffin-
embedded  (FFPE)  human  tissue  using  the  Leica  Microsystems  BOND  autostainer  and  Bond  Polymer 
Refine Detection. Analytical assay validation was performed on formalin-fixed specimens only. 
To  summarize  the  IHC  staining  method,  after  routine  deparaffinization  and  rehydration  of  the  tissue 
samples,  an  epitope  retrieval  procedure  is  performed.  FFPE  specimens  are  then  incubated  with  the 
primary monoclonal antibody to Nectin-4 (mouse clone M22-321b41.1) or the negative control (mouse 
IgG2a antibody). Next, a horseradish peroxidase enzyme-labeled anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody is 
applied, which is directed against the IgG of the animal species in which the primary antibody has been 
raised.  Finally,  peroxidase  is  added,  which  reacts  with  the  chromagen  3,3`-diaminobenzidine  (DAB), 
producing brown precipitate at the reaction site. The specimens are counterstained to identify cellular 
and subcellular elements. 
The read-out method to evaluate Nectin-4 IHC staining was performed by a trained pathologist using 
microscopy visual evaluation. Nectin-4 expression was reported using the H-score that considers both 
staining intensity and the percentage of cells stained at a specific range of intensities. The H-score is 
calculated by summing the products of the percentages of cells stained at a given intensity (0 - 100) 
and  the  staining  intensity  (0  -  3;  0  =  no  stain,  1  =  low  intensity,  2  =  medium  intensity,  3  =  high 
intensity): 
H-score = [1 x (% cells with intensity of 1)] + [2 x (% cells with intensity of 2)] + [3 x (% cells with 
intensity of 3)] 
The IHC H-score range is 0 to 300. The H-score value of 150 was selected as it represents the mid-point 
of the H-score range (0 - 300). Likewise, an H-score value of 225 represents the mid-point between 150 
and 300 (i.e., 75% of the maximum Nectin-4 expression). 
Nectin-4 assay analytical validation 
•  The Nectin-4 IHC assay was used retrospectively. Validation was performed per College of American 
Pathologists  (CAP)  Principles  of  Analytical  Validation  of  Immunohistochemistry  Assays  and  Clinical 
Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) standards for assay validations for research use only. 
Assay validation included the following parameters:  
•  Sensitivity: defined as positive staining in the tissues expected to express the antigen based on the 
literature. 
•  Specificity: differential staining observed across various tissue types, both expected and not expected 
to express the antigen using human specimens, each assayed in triplicate. 
•  Precision (intra-run): assessment of quantitative agreement of H-score values across  replicates using  
FFPE specimens representing the full range of Nectin-4 expression. 
•  Precision (inter-run / reproducibility): assessment of quantitative agreement of H-score values using3 
FFPE specimens representing the full range of Nectin-4 expression. 
•  Concordance  (inter-laboratory  /  inter-pathologist):  concordance  (agreement)  was  assessed  using 
FFPE specimens. For each specimen, FFPE slides from the same block were stained and scored by  
different pathologists. 
A stability study demonstrated a minimum of 3 months cut-slide stability for the Nectin-4 IHC assayFor 
each validation parameter, the prespecified acceptance criteria were met. In addition, upon a technology 
transfer, assay parameters were evaluated using analytical sensitivity, inter-laboratory/inter-pathologist 
concordance and precision on FFPE tumor tissue samples and again all acceptance criteria were met. In 
Assessment report

accordance with the CAP common checklist COM.40000 on method validation/verification approval, the 
method is considered acceptable for human tissue sample testing. 
Nectin-4 assay clinical validity 
Clinical validation has not been performed for the Nectin-4 IHC assay. 
Nectin-4 cut-point selection and validation 
The Nectin-4 IHC assay was validated for exploratory purposes and has been used to assess Nectin-4 
expression  retrospectively  in  patients’  tumors  for  enfortumab  vedotin  clinical  studies  in  urothelial 
carcinoma. Cut-points have not been validated.

Patient Report Outcomes (PROs)  
Baseline compliance rates were comparable for enfortumab vedotin and chemotherapy treatment 
groups in both EORTC QLQ-C30 (90.7% and 88.6%, respectively) and EQ-5D-5L (91.0% and 89.9%, 
respectively). Baseline completion rates were similar for enfortumab vedotin and chemotherapy 
treatment groups in both the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire (90.7% and 88.6%, respectively) and EQ-
5D-5L (91.0% and 89.9%, respectively). There was a commensurate drop off in the number of 
subjects available for each visit in both instruments, with both compliance and completion rates 
between treatment groups comparable throughout the study, and a decrease post week 12. 
EORTC QLQ-C30: The change in the Global Health Status (QL2, 2-item QOL subscale of the EORTC 
QLQ-C30) score from baseline assessment to week 12 assessment was prespecified as a secondary 
endpoint in the study protocol and SAP. Mean baseline (SD) scores were 63.83 (19.89) in the 
enfortumab vedotin arm and 64.58 (19.19) in the chemotherapy arm. Results from the Model 
Repeated Measures Approach (MMRM) analysis of QL2 indicated that QOL was maintained from 
baseline to week 12, with a smaller decrease in estimate values for the enfortumab vedotin arm (-
2.825 [1.348]) compared to subjects in the chemotherapy arm (-4.996 [1.479]), and no significant 
differences noted (P = 0.2429). 
Mean (SD) scores from the EORTC QLQ-C30 showed there was little deterioration in self-rated 
functional health from baseline to week 12 in the enfortumab vedotin arm, with reductions ranging 
from -0.92 (15.76) in cognitive functioning to -5.12 (23.80) in social functioning. For subjects in the 
chemotherapy arm, worsening in mean scores was overall numerically larger, ranging from -0.49 
(16.66) in cognitive functioning to -9.15 (26.29) in role functioning. For subjects in the enfortumab 
vedotin arm, a decrease in symptom burden from baseline to week 12 was observed for several 
subscales, including numerical improvements in insomnia (-3.67 [30.06]) and constipation (-6.04 
[27.99]). The largest numerical improvement was seen in change from baseline to week 12 in 
reduction of self-reported pain (-6.96 [26.26]). Little change in nausea and vomiting (-0.39 [16.73]) 
was reported, with small numerical increases in fatigue (3.94 [23.32]), dyspnoea (4.20 [20.14]), 
appetite loss (5.77 [32.56]) and diarrhoea (3.94 [24.35]). For subjects in the chemotherapy arm, 
increases in symptoms from baseline to week 12 were reported in pain (1.96 [24.07]), diarrhoea (3.27

[19.63]), appetite loss (3.92 [27.87]), dyspnoea (4.90 [20.66]) and fatigue (6.64 [22.56]). Little 
change was seen in mean scores of nausea and vomiting (0.16 [14.55]) and constipation (-0.98 
[24.13]), with a small improvement in insomnia (-1.63 [27.90]). 
EQ-5D-5L: A total of 13 subjects from 4 sites were removed from the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) 
analysis because of device display error on the VAS and their data were not included in the VAS 
analysis. Descriptive results from the EQ-5D-5L were largely consistent with EORTC QLQ-C30 QOL 
findings. Mean (SD) VAS scores at baseline were 68.2 (18.1) (median 70.0 [range 0 to 100]) for 
subjects in the enfortumab vedotin arm and 68.3 (18.8) (median 71 [range 0 to 100]) for subjects in 
the chemotherapy arm. Little deterioration was reported in mean (SD) VAS score from baseline to 
week 12 in the enfortumab vedotin arm (-1.8 [16.6]), with a larger decrease during the same time 
period in the chemotherapy arm (-5.3 [14.5]). Frequencies of problems in mobility, self-care, usual 
activities, pain and anxiety/depression largely mirrored QLQ-C30 findings.

Supportive studies 
Study EV-201 
EV-201 was a phase 2, open-label, multicentre, multi-cohort study of EV in subjects who have 
previously received a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor. 
Cohort 1 enrolled patients similar to those enrolled in EV-301 with locally advanced or metastatic UC  
previously treated with a PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor and a platinum-containing chemotherapy in the 
neoadjuvant/adjuvant, locally advanced or metastatic setting.   
Cohort 2 was constituted by patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC who had received a PD-
1/PD-L1 inhibitor and were platinum-naïve in the locally advanced/metastatic setting and were not 
eligible for cisplatin-containing chemotherapy. 
Study EV-101 
EV-101 was a phase 1, open-label, nonrandomized, multicentre study of the safety and PK of

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The application for a marketing authorisation for EV is based on results from phase III trial EV-301, 
phase I EV-101 and phase II EV-201. 
Based on favourable efficacy and safety results from phase I EV-101 and phase II EV-201 trials, the 
applicant designed EV-301 as an open-label phase III randomised controlled trial to evaluate 
enfortumab vedotin (EV) in comparison to one of three chemotherapy choices (paclitaxel, docetaxel or 
vinflunine) in the post-platinum and post-immunotherapy setting of advanced urothelial cancer.  
The design of the pivotal EV-301 trial had been discussed with the CHMP before starting recruitment 
(SA dated November 2017, original protocol dated December 2017). The targeted population, primary 
and secondary endpoints, chemotherapy comparators in the control arm and statistical analysis plan 
were all deemed appropriate.  
Cross over from chemotherapy to EV was not allowed until after results from the interim analysis were 
considered final (protocol V4).  
Inclusion and exclusion criteria did not suffer major changes along protocol amendments during the 
recruitment period. The proposed therapeutic indication for EV reflects the population included in EV-
301.  
The primary endpoint of EV-301 was OS, which is considered appropriate and in accordance with 
relevant European guidelines (EMA/CHMP/205/95). Secondary endpoints (PFS, ORR, DCR, DOR) used 
RECIST criteria for response evaluation, and although an independent review of the imaging was not

set up, the risk of investigator-bias in this open label trial is considered mitigated by OS being the 
primary endpoint. 
Statistical methods: Sample size was increased while recruitment was ongoing, which is not expected 
to affect integrity of the trial. The randomisation procedure is appropriate and the stratification factors 
(ECOG PS, Region of the World and liver metastases) are clinically relevant. ITT was used for OS and 
PFS1 analyses, while patients without measurable disease at baseline were excluded from the 
denominator in response-dependent endpoints ORR and DCR. The statistical methods for the analysis 
of OS and PFS1 are endorsed and the strategies implemented to control type I error along hierarchical 
testing are appropriate. SAP amendments on censoring rules and sensitivity analyses do not affect the 
interpretation of the results. An independent data analysis centre (IDAC) was used to produce 
unblinded summaries for the IDMC session, and aggregate safety summaries combined treatment 
groups for medical monitoring. 
Major protocol violations were rare and balanced between arms. The main criticism to the conduct of 
the trial was removing prespecified subgroup analyses of efficacy according to nectin-4 expression in 
protocol V2, but this was addressed by submitting the required data (see below). 
Results: 608 patients were randomised in the recruitment period: 301 to the EV arm and the 
remainder 307 to chemotherapy. The subject disposition tree can be followed, noticing a slightly higher 
proportion of patients who were randomised and withdrew consent before treatment in the control 
arm, an expectable situation in open-label trials.  
The overall demographic and disease characteristics of the population were balanced between arms 
and fairly represent clinical practice in the post-platinum post-immunotherapy setting of Urothelial 
Cancer, except for the proportion of upper (34%) vs. lower tract disease (66%) in EV-301. The 
applicant explains this difference on better opportunity for trial participation for this subgroup with 
worse prognosis.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
At data cutoff 15-JUL-2020 and with a median follow-up of 11.1 months, 301 deaths had occurred 
(49.5% of OS maturity) in the ITT population of EV-301. The study met its primary endpoint, as HR for 
OS showed superiority of EV over chemotherapy: 0.70 (95% CI 0.56, 0.89), p-value 0.00142. K-M 
estimates of median OS are 12.9 months in the EV arm and 9.0 in the chemotherapy arm. Sensitivity 
analyses that account for the effect of cross-over (RPSFT and IPCW methods, using the number of OS 
events specified in the original protocol) produced consistent HRs. Updated data from the final analysis 
of OS (data cutoff 30-JUL-2021) with 73% of event maturity provided consistent results, with an HR of 
0.70 (95% CI 0.58, 0.85). 
At 71% of PFS events, HR for PFS1 was 0.62 (95% CI 0.51, 0.75), p-value <0.00001. K-M estimates 
of median PFS1 were 5.6 months in the EV arm and 3.7 in the chemotherapy arm. Sensitivity analyses 
with less conservative censoring rules produced similar results.  
Confirmed ORR rate was 41% in the EV arm and 18% in the chemo arm, noticing consistent results in 
requested sensitivity analyses that used ITT as denominator. K-M estimates of median DOR were 
numerically longer in the chemo arm (8.1 months) than the EV arm (7.4 months), but the 12-month 
landmark analyses of DOR suggest improved performance of EV (28% still on response) vs. chemo 
(20%). In support of the survival advantage, median PFS2 is numerically longer in the EV arm (9.6 
months) as compared to the chemo arm (7.0 months).  
Superiority of EV over chemo is observed across most of the predefined subgroup analyses of OS and 
PFS1, albeit noticing diminished survival in the female subgroup (HR 1.171, 95% CI 0.724, 1.894). The 
Assessment report  
EMA/249357/2022 
Page 128/188 
 
 
 
 
subgroup comprises 23% of the ITT, paralleling gender distribution of the global incidence of urothelial 
cancers.  Since the pattern of worse survival for female patients with bladder cancer seems established 
and attributable to a multiplicity of factors (Donsky et al, 2013; Liu et al, 2015), clinical plausibility of 
the findings from EV-301 appears unlikely.  
As supportive data, the applicant submitted efficacy results from advanced urothelial cancer cohorts of 
phase I and II trials along the clinical development of EV. ORR is consistently above 40% across prior-
platinum and platinum-naïve cohorts, noticing overall similar median PFS (range 5.55-6.60 months) 
and median OS (range 12.12-14.7 months). 
Efficacy according to nectin-4 expression:  
The mechanism of action of EV relies on cytotoxicity by specifically binding to nectin-4 protein, 
markedly upregulated on the surface of bladder cancer cells, and implicated in crucial tumoural biology 
mechanisms (proliferation, invasion, migration, metastasis, angiogenesis and anchorage 
independence). Since nectin-4 can be objectively measured (analytical validation of nectin-4 IHC is 
presented in the Ancillary analysis section), the potential relationship between this biomarker and 
efficacy was explored in patients from EV-301 with available tissue. 
Even if nectin-4 expression evaluability was not an inclusion criterion, IHC H-score results were 
retrospectively analysed for ~87% (n=527) of the ITT (N=608). Efficacy parameters and their 
confidence intervals in the biomarker-available population are overall comparable to those in the ITT 
population: HR for OS is 0.69 (0.70 in ITT); HR for PFS is 0.61 in both populations; ORR for EV is 39% 
(nectin-4) and 41% (ITT); and ORR for chemotherapy is 17% (nectin-4) and 18% (ITT). 
Albeit results from the initial analyses suggested that a survival advantage was not apparent in low-
expressors, data from the final analysis of OS indicate that there is insufficient evidence to conclude 
that efficacy is affected by nectin-4 expression in the biomarker-available population. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Pivotal study EV-301 had  a positive outcome, showing a statistically significant and clinically relevant 
survival advantage of enfortumab vedotin over chemotherapy in the post-platinum post-immunotherapy 
setting of advanced urothelial cancer. The benefit was observed across most subgroups, was consistent 
over  diverse  sensitivity  analyses  and  updated  results,  and  is  further  supported  by  superiority  across 
PFS1, PFS2 and response-related endpoints. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety profile of enfortumab vedotin was established from 5 ongoing or completed clinical studies 
and includes 680 unique subjects dosed with enfortumab vedotin 1.25 mg/kg. The overall safety 
evaluation is based on the EV-301 enfortumab vedotin population; the EV-301 chemotherapy 
population; Cohort 1 of EV-201; Cohort 2 of EV-201; and all subjects who received a starting dose of 
enfortumab vedotin of 1.25 mg/kg in EV-301, EV-201, EV-101 and EV-102 (enfortumab vedotin 
1.25 mg/kg safety analysis group). (Table 81).

The safety evaluation is mainly focus on the phase 3 study EV-301 and the additional data from study 
EV-201/ Cohort 1 (201/C1), where the patient population was similar to patients in study EV-301 
(prior PD1/PD-L1 inhibitor and cisplatin-containing therapy).  
Study EV-201, Cohort 2, had prior PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor therapy but were deemed ineligible for 
cisplatin-containing therapy (cut-off 8 Sep 2020).  
In addition, 170 patients having received 1.25 mg/kg enfortumab vedotin in the two phase 1 studies 
EV-101 and EV-102 were included in the entire 680 patients ISS (integrated summary of safety). 
Thirty-five of these did not have urothelial cancer but NSCLC or ovarian cancer.  
The median exposure to enfortumab vedotin in study EV-301 was 4.99 months and 4.60 months in 
study 201/ Cohort 1. Exposure to chemotherapy in study EV-301 was 3.45 months (Table 83).

An overview of TEAEs across the safety analysis groups is presented in Table 88 
Given the difference between the 2 treatment arms in terms of time on treatment (median duration of 
treatment was 4.99 months for the enfortumab vedotin arm and 3.45 months for the chemotherapy 
arm), AE data are also represented in terms of events per patient-year (P-Y).

Vascular Disorders 
Grade 3 and higher adverse events 
Grade ≥3 TEAEs reported in ≥5% of participants on the safety analysis set are summarised in Table 91 
In the enfortumab vedotin arm, TEAEs with NCI-CTCAE Grade 3 or 4 occurring in ≥ 5% of subjects by 
PT were anaemia, fatigue, neutrophil count decreased, hyperglycaemia, decreased appetite, and rash 
maculo-papular. In the chemotherapy arm, the most common TEAEs Grade 3 or 4 occurring in ≥ 5% of 
subjects by PT were neutrophil count decreased, anaemia, neutropenia, white blood cell count 
decreased, and febrile neutropenia. Although diarrhoea is a frequent AE for EV (34.8%), Grade 3-4 
was only observed in 3.7% [chemotherapy arm; 22.7% (all AEs) and 1.7% (Grade 3-4)].  
The incidence of Grade 3-4 Infections (SOC) in study EV-301 was higher in the EV-arm despite 
neutropenia (laboratory and AE) occurring more frequently in the chemotherapy arm. The exposure 
was +1.5 months longer in the EV arm.  
In study EV-301 Grade 3-4 hyperglycaemia occurred in 21 patients (7.1%;) in EV arm and in 2 
patients (0.7%) in the chemotherapy arm.  
The proportion of subjects who experienced TEAEs with Grade 3 or 4 in Cohort 1 EV-201 (74.4%) was 
numerically higher compared with Cohort 2 (68.5%).  
The incidence of Grade 3 or 4 acute kidney injury was numerically higher in Cohort 2-EV-201 (10.1%) 
than in Cohort 1 -EV-201 (3.2%) (Table 91)

Table 88 Treatment-emergent Adverse Events of Special Interest (SAF) 
Skin  Reactions 
The incidence of all skin reactions and severe cutaneous adverse reactions in the EV arm of study EV-
301 was high compared to the chemotherapy arm (53.7% / 26.0% vs 19.9% / 9.3%).  
In Study 201/C1 53.6% of subjects experienced skin reactions. The median time to first onset of any 
grade skin reaction was 0.49 months (range 0.1 to 13.1). Both the incidence and time to onset were 
similar to study EV-301/EV-arm (0.46 months). The median time to resolution was 0.72 months (range 
0.03 to 14.65) and the median time to improvement was 0.82 months (range 0.16 to 2.20). One patient 
experienced Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) as assessed by two dermatologists but not confirmed by 
a third dermatologist.

Peripheral Neuropathy 
The cytotoxic component of enfortumab vedotin, MMAE, is a microtubule-disrupting agent [Challita-Eid 
et al, 2016]. Peripheral neuropathy is often associated with drugs that affect microtubules and is 
associated with other MMAE ADCs [Donaghy, 2016]. 
Overall, peripheral neuropathy occurred commonly in the enfortumab vedotin-treated subjects, mainly 
at low grades; few subjects experienced Grade 3 events and 1 subject experienced a Grade 4 event.   
Peripheral neuropathy events were predominantly sensory in nature. Peripheral neuropathy was the 
most common adverse event overall leading to treatment discontinuation in the enfortumab vedotin 
safety population (4.8 % in study 301 EV arm compared to 2.1% in the chemo-arm and 7.2 % in 
study EV-201/C1, see Table 110 /SCS in the Discontinuation section below).

Enfortumab vedotin 1.25 mg/kg column includes all subjects in the following studies who received a 1.25 mg/kg dose of enfortumab vedotin: EV-101, EV-
102, EV-201, and EV-301. 
As of last follow-up, 15/70 subjects (21%) in study EV-201 had resolution of all events and an 
additional 24 subjects (34%) had resolution or improvement in at least some events meaning that 
55/125 patients still had some degree of neuropathy. The majority of subjects with ongoing PN at last 
follow-up had either Grade 1 (36/55 subjects; 66%) or Grade 2 (17/55 subjects; 31%) events.  
Recommendations regarding dose interruption, reduction, and discontinuation in case of peripheral 
neuropathy are included in the SmPC, section 4.2.  
Hyperglycaemia 
Overall, hyperglycemia has been reported in approximately 15% of subjects treated with enfortumab 
vedotin. Hyperglycemia events were most frequently Grade 3 in severity. In Study EV 301 11.8% in 
the EV arm and 2.7% in the Chemo-arm had any hyperglycaemic event, and one subject in the 
enfortumab vedotin arm died due to hyperglycemia. In Study EV-201 for subjects with treatment-
emergent hyperglycemia, the median time to first onset of any grade hyperglycemia in Cohort 1 was 
0.64 months (range 0.26 to 9.23) and the median time to first onset of ≥ Grade 3 hyperglycemia was 
1.13 months (range 0.3 to 2.3). Most cases resolved (18/20) and the median time to resolution was 
0.85 months (range 0.10 to 13.67).  
Study EV-301 data suggest that hyperglycemia events were more common in subjects with a baseline 
BMI  ≥  30  kg/m2  (Table  98)  and  in  patients  with  a  prior  medical  history  of  hyperglycemia  who  were 
treated with enfortumab vedotin.  
Recommendations regarding dose interruption in case of hyperglycaemia are included in SmPC section 
4.2 while in section 4.4 information regarding a higher risk of hyperglycaemia in patients with BMI ≥ 30 
kg/m2 is also stated.

Extravasation Events 
As enfortumab vedotin is administered intravenously extravasation may occur. In Study EV-301, 3 
subjects (1.0%) in the enfortumab vedotin arm and 7 subjects (2.4%) in the chemotherapy arm 
experienced any extravasation events. These events were Grade 1 or Grade 2. None of subjects in 
either the enfortumab vedotin or chemotherapy arms reported extravasation events that resulted in 
treatment withdrawal, and only 1 event in the chemotherapy arm was considered serious. The 
incidence and severity of extravasation events was consistent across the safety analysis groups. 
Infusion-related Reactions (IRRs) 
As enfortumab vedotin is an ADC, there is a potential risk of a hypersensitivity reaction and/or 
systemic infusion-related reactions. The incidence and severity of infusion-related reactions was similar 
across safety analysis groups. In the enfortumab vedotin 1.25 mg/kg group, 6.3% of subjects had any 
infusion-related reaction and 1.0% of subjects experienced a Grade 3 infusion-related reaction. In 
Study EV-301, 9.1% of subjects in the enfortumab vedotin arm and 5.8% of subjects in the 
chemotherapy arm experienced any infusion-related reactions.    
Anaemia and Neutropenia 
Anaemia:  
In Study EV-301, the proportion of subjects who experienced any anaemia event was higher in the 
chemotherapy arm (30.2%) compared with the enfortumab vedotin arm (19.9%) (Table 100).   
In study 201 the incidence of anaemia was higher than in study 301 (35.2% for Cohort 1 and 19.9%, 
respectively).

Enfortumab vedotin 1.25 mg/kg column includes all subjects in the following studies who received a 1.25 mg/kg dose of enfortumab vedotin: EV-101, EV-
102, EV-201 and EV-301. 
Neutropenia: 
In Study EV-301, the proportion of subjects who experienced any neutropenia event was higher in the 
chemotherapy arm (29.6%) compared with the enfortumab vedotin arm (18.2%). The corresponding 
Grade 3-4 neutropenia events were 8.5% vs 4.7% (Table 101). 
In Study EV-301 the incidence of subjects receiving colony stimulating factors was 7.1% in the 
enfortumab vedotin arm compared with 30.6% in the chemotherapy arm, which also has to be 
considered when assessing the incidence of neutropenia.  
Despite neutropenia being less frequent in the EV arm compared to the chemotherapy arm in study 
301 (4.7% vs 7.6%), the incidence of infections (by SOC) was higher in the EV arm (16.9% vs 9.6%) 
underlining the added risk of infection in the EV-arm despite the higher incidence of neutropenia in the 
chemotherapy arm.  
In study EV-301, based on an ad hoc analysis, the incidence of Grade 3 or 4 infections within 14 days 
after an AE of neutropenia or neutrophil laboratory value of grade 3 or 4 was comparable between the 
EV and chemo arm (2.4% vs 1.7%).

Gastrointestinal symptoms 
Nectin-4 expression has been identified in the esophagus and the stomach in Study ES10-001 [Study 
ES10-001] and weak staining was observed in the mucosal glands of other gastrointestinal tract 
organs including the small intestine, colon, and rectum. The gastrointestinal toxicities of diarrhea, 
nausea and vomiting, are common events reported with the use of MMAE-ADCs, including enfortumab 
vedotin. 
In Study EV-301, the incidence of diarrhoea was higher in the enfortumab vedotin arm (34.8%; 3.4% 
Grade 3, none Grade 4) compared with the chemotherapy arm (22.7%; 1.7% Grade 3, none Grade 4).  
Assessment report

The incidence of vomiting was similar in both the treatment groups (14.2% in the enfortumab vedotin 
arm and 15.1% in the chemotherapy arm). In study EV-201/C1 the incidence of diarrhoea was 42.4% 
of which 4% were Grade 3 and none Grade 4.  
No enfortumab vedotin subject reported gastrointestinal nonspecific symptoms and therapeutic 
procedure SMQs that resulted in treatment withdrawal, whereas three patients in the chemotherapy 
arm withdrew (1 due to vomiting, 2 due to constipation).

Ocular Disorders 
In Study EV-301, the proportion of subjects who experienced any ocular disorder event was higher in 
the enfortumab vedotin arm (28%) compared with the chemotherapy arm (7.9%) (Table 103 3/SCS). 
The majority of the ocular events were of Grade 1 or 2, with 2 subjects reporting Grade 3 events in the 
enfortumab vedotin arm, and 1 in the chemotherapy arm. One subject in the enfortumab vedotin arm 
and none in the chemotherapy arm reported ocular events that resulted in treatment withdrawal. Two 
subjects in the enfortumab vedotin arm and none in the chemotherapy arm experienced ocular event 
that was considered serious. In the enfortumab vedotin arm, the most common ocular disorder events 
occurring in ≥ 5% of subjects by PT were lacrimation increased, dry eye, vision blurred and 
conjunctivitis. In the chemotherapy arm, there were no ocular disorder events occurring in ≥ 5% of 
subjects.  
In Study EV-201, the proportion of subjects who experienced any ocular disorder event was higher in 
Cohort 1 (47.2%) compared with Cohort 2 (34.8%) and markedly higher than in study EV-301 (28%).

Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
See also section on Adverse events of interest/ anaemia and neutropenia. 
The incidence of Low lymphocytes, Grade 3-4, was higher in the chemotherapy arm in study EV-301 
(12.7%) compared to the enfortumab vedotin arm (9.3%) despite the target of the latter being the B-
lymphocytes. In study EV-201/ Cohort 1 the corresponding incidence was comparable (9.8%) and for 
the entire 1.25 mg/kg group it was 12.3%.

Generally various AEs (by SOC and PT) were slightly higher in patients age 75-85 years compared to the 
younger  cohorts.  There  were  too  few  patients  in  the  age  group  >  85  years  to  conclude  anything 
meaningful.   
Gender 
The effect of sex on the safety of enfortumab vedotin was assessed across the safety analysis groups.  
Urothelial  cancer  is  more  prevalent  in  males,  with  approximately  75%  of  all  new  cases  worldwide 
occurring in males and 25% in females.  
Ethnicity  
The two major ethnicities in the safety studies were White and Asian. Only seven patients in the safety 
population  were  Black  or  African  American.  No  marked  difference  in  safety  was  seen  with  regards  to 
race (White vs non-White).   
BMI 
The incidences of various AEs (SAEs, death, ≥ grade 3 AEs, discontinuation) were higher in patients with 
a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 in the enfortumab vedotin arm compared to the patients in the chemotherapy arm 
where the incidences were generally the same or lower in the ≥ 30 kg/m2 population. A table comparing 
the overview of TEAEs and the TEAEs by SOC and PT between subjects with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 and < 30 
kg/m2 treated by enfortumab vedotin using the 60 day updated safety data has been provided.  
Table 104 Overview of treatment-emergent Adverse events by baseline BMI category  
Assessment report  
EMA/249357/2022 
Page 166/188 
 
 
 
 
 
 
BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 was identified as a risk factor for hyperglycemia events. Additional TEAEs by SOCs and 
PT occurred more frequently in enfortumab vedotin–treated subjects with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 compared to 
<  30  kg/m2  in  the  EV  1.25  mg/kg  population:  Gastrointestinal  disorders  (+13.7%)  of  which  nausea 
(+21.2%)  and  diarrhoea  (+15.7%),  Metabolism  and  nutrition  disorders  (+10.7%)  of  which 
hyperglycemia  (+18.2%),  hypokalaemia  (+7.4%)  and  hyperuricaemia  (+  7.6%),  Renal  and  urinary 
disorders (+10.4%) including acute kidney injury (+10.6%). However, the limited number of patients in 
the BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 group prevents any clear conclusion.   
The higher incidence of hyperglycaemia in patients with a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 in the EV-arm is described in 
the Adverse events/ AESI section.  
Hepatic and Renal function 
No difference in adverse events (SAEs, death, discontinuation) were observed between normal and mild 
hepatic function in the EV arm of study EV-301 compared to the chemotherapy arm.  
In study EV-301, 45.9% of subjects in EV arm and 46.4% in the chemotherapy arm had a moderate 
renal function at baseline. The overall incidence of TEAEs (related, serious, discontinued, dose reduced, 
etc.) were comparable between arms.   
In  study  EV-301,  30.4%  of  subjects  in  EV  arm  and  31.6%  in  the  chemotherapy  arm  had  a  liver 
metastasis at baseline . Subjects with or without a liver metastasis at baseline had a similar overall 
incidence of TEAEs (related, serious, discontinued, dose reduced).  
ECOG status  
In  Study  EV-301,  61.5%  of  subjects  in  the  enfortumab  vedotin  arm  and  62.5%  of  subjects  in  the 
chemotherapy arm had an ECOG performance status of 1 at baseline; only 2 subjects (0.7%) in the 
enfortumab vedotin arm and no subjects in the chemotherapy had an ECOG performance status of 2 at 
baseline. The incidences of serious, discontinued, and dose reduced AEs were comparable between the 
two ECOG performance status’ in each arm, which is not unexpected given they are both low ECOGs.

TEAEs by Geographic Region: The incidence of the most common TEAEs occurring in ≥ 10% of 
subjects was similar across all geographical regions. Subjects in Study EV-301 had a similar overall 
incidence of TEAEs (serious, deaths, discontinued, dose reduced) regardless of the prior lines of 
therapy they received.  
Immunological events

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
See pharmacokinetic section.  
Discontinuation due to AES 
Treatment discontinuation  
In the enfortumab vedotin arm of study EV-301 the most common TEAEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation in ≥ 1% of subjects by PT were peripheral sensory neuropathy, peripheral motor 
neuropathy, malignant neoplasm progression, rash maculo-papular, and acute kidney injury. All these 
events were considered drug related, except for malignant neoplasm progression and for acute kidney 
injury. 
In the chemotherapy arm, the most common TEAE that led to treatment discontinuation occurring in ≥ 
1% of subjects by PT were febrile neutropenia, general physical health deterioration, sepsis, malignant 
neoplasm progression, and peripheral sensory neuropathy All events were considered drug related, 
except for malignant neoplasm progression.  The incidence of discontinuation was comparable between 
the arms in study 301 and to study 201/C1 (Table 110).  
In Study EV-301, in the enfortumab vedotin arm, the most common adverse events that led to 
treatment discontinuation occurring in ≥ 1% of subjects by PT were peripheral neuropathy, rash 
maculo-papular, and acute kidney injury (Table 24/ SCS). All these events were considered drug 
related, except for acute kidney injury, where only 1 subject out of 3 had an event that was considered 
drug related. In the chemotherapy arm, the most common TEAE that led to treatment discontinuation 
occurring in ≥ 1% of subjects by PT were febrile neutropenia, general physical health deterioration, 
sepsis, and peripheral (sensory) neuropathy. All events were considered drug related.

Dose reduction due to TEAEs 
In the enfortumab vedotin arm of study EV-301the most common TEAEs that led to a dose reduction 
occurring in ≥ 2% of subjects by PT were peripheral neuropathy, rash maculo-papular, decreased 
appetite, fatigue, and neutrophil count decreased (Table 111) The majority of these events were 
considered drug related. In the chemotherapy arm, the most common TEAEs leading to a dose 
reduction occurring in ≥ 2% of subjects by PT were peripheral neuropathy, fatigue, neutrophil count 
decreased, neutropenia, constipation, and febrile neutropenia. The majority of these events were 
considered drug related.

Adverse events related to study drug as assessed by the investigator, or missing relationship  
Post marketing experience 
Padcev has been approved on 18 Dec 2019 in the United States of America for the treatment of adult 
subjects with locally advanced or metastatic UC who have previously received a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor, 
and a platinum-containing chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant, locally advanced or metastatic 
setting.   
From 18 Dec 2019 to 17 Mar 2020, 55 cases were revealed. A total of 147 AEs was contained in the 55 
case reports received during the reporting period. Of these, 64 were serious and unexpected, 18 were 
serious  and  expected,  26  were  nonserious  and  unexpected  and  39  were  nonserious  and  expected 
(Periodic Adverse Drug Experience Report Date, 07 Apr 2020). The unexpected postmarketing AEs and 
all postmarketing serious AEs including deaths have been provided and discussed by the applicant.  
Events related to disease progression were the most frequently reported events in the postmarketing 
setting.  Skin  reactions including  skin toxicity,  SJS  and  TEN  are  listed  in  the most  frequently  reported 
unexpected postmarketing adverse events. Of the 8 cases of SJS, one recovered, 2 were fatal and the 
outcomes of the other cases were not reported. Of the 5 TEN, one was not recovered as of 15 June 2021, 
2 cases were fatal and the other cases had a non-reported outcome.  
There was a total of 11 cases of neutropenia reported in postmarketing setting. Based on an evaluation 
report, it is  concluded that there is sufficient evidence that supports a causal association between the 
occurrence of Neutropenia events and enfortumab vedotin.  
Based on the last quarterly periodic adverse experience report (PAER) an update of the United States 
Prescribing Information has been updated with a warning regarding skin reactions.

Additional safety information: 
The CHMP had initially adopted an opinion on 16 December 2021 but during the decision-making 
process further safety information was brought to the attention of the CHMP. In view of the 
seriousness of the safety findings, on 24 January 2022 the European Commission returned the pending 
decision Opinion to the CHMP in order to allow the CHMP to assess the possible impact of the findings 
on the marketing authorisation application.  
Ten serious cases of SCAR (severe cutaneous adverse reaction) among the 231 subjects from the EV-
902 expanded access program have been reported to the sponsor drug safety database as of 10 Jan 
2022. Five cases occurred in France, four of which were fatal.  Of the remaining 5 serious cases, 3 
occurred in Austria, 1 in Japan, and 1 in Switzerland. The case in Switzerland also reported a fatal 
outcome, bringing the total number of fatal cases of SCAR events from the EV-902 program to five.  
The most frequent PTs reported amongst all the 10 cases were dermatitis bullous (4 events) and SJS 
(3 events), TEN (2 events), SDRIFE (symmetrical drug-related intertriginous and flexural exanthema; 
1 event) and drug eruption (1 event). Three events of dermatitis bullous, 1 event of SDRIFE and 1 
event of SJS were reported with fatal outcome. The cause of death in the remaining 1 subject was 
MODS (multiple organ dysfunction syndrome). 
The MAH provided a Comprehensive Assessment Report (CAR) including available narrative for the 
fatal cases, possible correlation between the skin AE, systemic reactions and death and predisposition 
factors.  
Based on the assessment of these serious and fatal events the followings changes to the SmPC, 
section 4.2 and 4.4 were recommended:

Furthermore, the CHMP and PRAC consider appropriate the implementation of a Patient Card for each 
patient treated with Padcev – see the RMP section. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  evaluation  of  the  safety  profile  of  enfortumab  vedotin  in  the  intended  population,  i.e.  locally 
advanced  or  metastatic  UC  that  had  previously  received  therapy  with  a  PD-1/PD-L1  inhibitor  and  a 
platinum-containing chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant/adjuvant, locally advanced or metastatic setting, 
is based on a total of 680 subjects treated with enfortumab vedotin at the intended posology of 1.25 
mg/kg and 291 subjects treated with chemotherapy. A total of 4 clinical studies are included in the safety 
data sets for the current application (pivotal Study EV-301, Study EV-201, Study -101 and Study EV-
102). The safety evaluation mainly focussed on the phase 3 study EV-301 and the additional data from 
study 201/ Cohort 1, where the patient population was similar (prior PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor and cisplatin-
containing therapy). The number of patients in the phase 3 study (n=296 in the EV arm and n=291 in 
the chemo arm) supported by safety data from four SATs in patients (n=384) who received an EV dose 
of 1.25 mg/kg are considered sufficient to address all relatively frequent adverse events. 
The median exposure to enfortumab vedotin in study EV-301 was 4.99 months and 4.60 months in 
study EV-201/ Cohort 1. Exposure to chemotherapy in study EV-301 was 3.45 months.  
Assessment report  
EMA/249357/2022 
Page 175/188 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the main safety population (Study 301 and 201/C1) only 31 patients received enfortumab vedotin 
for ≥ 1 year. With the requested safety update the number of patients increased to 54; no new 
patients were included. Long-term safety data are scarce and are thus considered as Missing 
information in the Summary of safety concerns. (See RMP) 
In study EV-301 in the enfortumab vedotin arm, the most common TEAEs occurring in ≥ 20% of 
subjects by PT were alopecia, decreased appetite, fatigue, diarrhea, peripheral sensory neuropathy, 
pruritus, nausea, constipation, dysgeusia, and pyrexia.   
In the chemotherapy arm, the most common TEAEs occurring in ≥ 20% of subjects by PT were 
alopecia, anemia, decreased appetite, fatigue, nausea, constipation, diarrhea, and peripheral sensory 
neuropathy.   
Generally, the adverse events occurring with a higher incidence in the EV arm of study EV-301 
(compared to the chemotherapy arm) seemed to occur with an even higher incidence in study EV-
201/C1. This could be reasonably explained by the difference between the populations in the two 
studies, 17.6% patients with ≥ 3 prior systemic therapies in study Ev-301 vs 51.2% in the EV-201 
study.   
In the enfortumab vedotin arm, TEAEs with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-
CTCAE) Grade 3 or 4 occurring in ≥ 5% of subjects by PT were anemia, fatigue, neutrophil count 
decreased, hyperglycemia, decreased appetite, and rash maculo-papular. In the chemotherapy arm, 
the most common TEAEs Grade 3 or 4 occurring in ≥ 5% of subjects by PT were neutrophil count 
decreased, anemia, neutropenia, white blood cell count decreased, and febrile neutropenia.  
Of the drug-related TEAEs that occurred in ≥ 10% of subjects in either arm, the incidence of peripheral 
sensory neuropathy, dysgeusia, pruritis, rash, dry skin and rash maculo-papular was higher in the 
enfortumab vedotin arm. 
AEOIs for enfortumab vedotin include skin reactions (severe cutaneous adverse reactions and rash), 
peripheral neuropathy, hyperglycemia, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dry eye, anemia, extravasation 
events, neutropenia, infusion-related reactions (other than extravasation events), corneal disorders, 
blurred vision, and ATAs.   
Skin reactions are considered as on-target toxicity of enfortumab vedotin due to Nectin-4 expression in 
the skin. The incidence of all skin reactions and severe cutaneous adverse reactions in the EV arm in 
study EV-301 compared to the chemotherapy arm (53.7% / 26.0% vs 19.9% / 9.3%) was high. For 
resolution data references were made to data from study EV-201where 53.6% of subjects experienced 
skin reactions. The median time to resolution was 0.72 months (range 0.03 to 14.65) and the median 
time to improvement was 0.82 months (range 0.16 to 2.20). One patient experienced Stevens-
Johnson syndrome (SJS) as assessed by two dermatologists but not according to one other 
dermatologist. On February 2021, the studies’ sponsors informed of an important safety concern within 
enfortumab vedotin regarding severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including fatal cases of Stevens-
Johnson Syndrome (SJS) and toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) that have occurred in patients treated 
with enfortumab vedotin in the post-marketing setting and during clinical trials. These cutaneous 
adverse reactions have occurred predominantly during the first cycle of treatment with enfortumab 
vedotin but may occur later. Recommendations regarding dose interruption, reduction, and 
discontinuation in case of skin reactions including suspected SJS and toxic epidermal necrolysis are 
included in the SmPC, section 4.2. A review of all serious cases of skin reactions in the post-marketing 
setting and during clinical trials was performed by the applicant. At this stage, no additional 
minimization measure than those planned in the RMP is requested for the risk of skin reactions. SmPC 
section 4.4 reflects that skin reactions are associated with enfortumab vedotin as a result of 
Assessment report  
EMA/249357/2022

enfortumab vedotin binding to Nectin 4 expressed in the skin. Mild to moderate skin reactions, 
predominantly maculopapular rash, have been reported. Severe cutaneous adverse reactions, including 
SJS and TEN, with fatal outcome have also occurred in patients treated with enfortumab vedotin, 
predominantly during the first cycle of treatment. In clinical trials, the median time to onset of severe 
skin reactions was 0.6 months (range: 0.1 to 6.4). Patients should be monitored starting with the first 
cycle and throughout treatment for skin reactions. Appropriate treatment such as topical 
corticosteroids and antihistamines can be considered for mild to moderate skin reactions. For 
suspected SJS or TEN, withhold treatment and consider referral for specialised care. As discussed 
above (section 2.6) several fatal cases were observed in compassionate use programs. This 
information was assessed by the CHMP after the initial opinion and the SmPC and RMP were updated 
before the re-adoption of the opinion in order to properly mitigate these ADRs in the clinical setting.  
Overall, peripheral neuropathy occurred commonly in the enfortumab vedotin-treated subjects, mainly 
at low grades; few subjects experienced Grade 3 events and 1 subject experienced a Grade 4 event.  
Peripheral neuropathy (PN) has been identified as adverse event of interest since it is often associated 
with drugs that affect microtubules such as enfortumab vedotin and is associated with other MMAE ADCs. 
Peripheral neuropathy, event that was predominantly sensory in nature, was the most common adverse 
event overall leading to treatment discontinuation in the enfortumab vedotin safety population (4.8 % 
in study EV-301 EV arm compared to 2.1% in the chemo-arm and 7.2 % in study EV- 201/C1). Peripheral 
neuropathy can be quite debilitating. For study EV-201/C1, as of last follow-up, 15/70 subjects (21%) 
had resolution of all events and an additional 24 subjects (34%) had resolution or improvement in at 
least some events meaning that 55/125 patients still had some degree of neuropathy. The majority of 
subjects with ongoing PN at last follow-up had either Grade 1 (36/55 subjects; 66%) or Grade 2 (17/55 
subjects; 31%) events. Recommendations regarding dose interruption, reduction, and discontinuation 
in case of peripheral neuropathy are included in the SmPC, section 4.2. The SmPC reflects that peripheral 
neuropathy,  predominantly  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy,  has  occurred  with  enfortumab  vedotin, 
including Grade ≥3 reactions. Patients with pre-existing peripheral neuropathy Grade ≥2 were excluded 
from  clinical  trials.  Patients  should  be  monitored  for  symptoms  of  new  or  worsening  peripheral 
neuropathy  as  these  patients  may  require  a  delay,  dose  reduction  or  discontinuation  of  enfortumab 
vedotin. 
Hyperglycaemia is a key adverse event of interest. The causal mechanism is unknown. In Study EV-301, 
11.8% of subjects in the EV arm and 2.7% in the Chemo-arm had any hyperglycaemic event, with Grade 
3-4  hyperglycaemia  occurring  in  21  patients  (7.1%;)  in  the  EV  arm  and  in  2  patients  (0.7%)  in  the 
chemotherapy arm. A fatal case due to hyperglycaemia occurred in the enfortumab vedotin arm. Data 
in particular from the randomised study EV-301 suggest that hyperglycaemia events were more common 
in  subjects  with  a  baseline  BMI  ≥  30  kg/m2(Table  98)  and  in  patients  with  a  prior  medical  history  of 
hyperglycaemia (Ad-hoc Table 99), who were treated with enfortumab vedotin.  
Hyperglycaemia events generally occurred approximately 15 days after initiation of enfortumab vedotin 
treatment based on the median time to onset of 0.57 months (range 0.1 to 20.3) based on 98 events in 
EV  1.25mg/kg  group.  In  Study  EV-201,  the  median  time  to  resolution  of  hyperglycaemia  was  0.95 
months based on 27 events and the median time to improvement was 0.48 months based on 6 events. 
Most events resolved and subjects without preexisting hyperglycaemia or diabetes requiring treatment 
did  not  require  ongoing  anti-diabetic  medications.  Serious  hyperglycaemia  events  occurred  in  15/680 
(2.2%)  patients  from  enfortumab  vedotin  1.25  mg/kg  group  and  represents  15.3%  (15/98)  of  the 
hyperglycaemia events reported. Recommendations on dose interruption in case of hyperglycaemia are 
listed in the SmPC section 4.2. In section 4.4 information regarding a higher risk of hyperglycaemia in 
patients with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 is also stated.  
Assessment report  
EMA/249357/2022

In  Study  EV-301,  9.1%  of  subjects  in  the  enfortumab  vedotin  arm  and  5.8%  of  subjects  in  the 
chemotherapy  arm  experienced  any  infusion-related  reactions.  Information  regarding  the  use  of 
antihistamines, acetaminophen, and corticosteroids is given in section 4.4 in the SmPC.  
In Study EV-301, the proportion of subjects who experienced any anemia and neutropenia event was 
higher in the chemotherapy arm (30.2%; 29.6%) compared with the enfortumab vedotin arm (19.9%; 
18.2). Grade 3-4 neutropenia events were 8.5% in the chemotherapy arm vs 4.7% for the enfortumab 
vedotin arm. The incidence of subjects receiving colony stimulating factors was 7.1% in the 
enfortumab vedotin arm compared with 30.6% in the chemotherapy arm, which has to be considered 
when assessing the risk of neutropenia. Despite neutropenia being less frequent in the EV arm 
compared to the chemotherapy arm in study 301 (4.7% vs 7.6%), the incidence of infections (by SOC) 
was higher in the EV arm (16.9% vs 9.6%) underlining the added risk of infection in the EV-arm 
despite the higher incidence of neutropenia in the chemotherapy arm. Neutropenia, febrile neutropenia 
and neutrophil count decreased are listed as adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
The gastrointestinal toxicities of diarrhea, nausea and vomiting, are common events reported with the 
use  of  MMAE-ADCs,  including  enfortumab  vedotin.  In  Study  EV-301,  the  incidence  of  diarrhoea  was 
higher  in  the  enfortumab  vedotin  arm  (34.8%;  3.4%  Grade  3,  none  Grade  4)  compared  with  the 
chemotherapy arm (22.7%; 1.7% Grade 3, none Grade 4).  The incidence of vomiting was similar in 
both the treatment groups (14.2% in the enfortumab vedotin arm and 15.1% in the chemotherapy arm). 
In study 201/C1 the incidence of diarrhoea was 42.4% of which 4% were Grade 3 and none Grade 4. 
In Study EV-301, the proportion of subjects who experienced any ocular disorder event was higher in 
the enfortumab vedotin arm (28%) compared with the chemotherapy arm (7.9%) and the majority of 
events were of Grade 1 or 2. Section 4.4 of the SmPC reflects that ocular disorders, predominantly dry 
eye, have occurred in patients treated with enfortumab vedotin and that patients should be monitored 
for ocular disorders. 
During the SA in 2018 the CHMP advised that cardiac toxicity should be monitored carefully in EV-301 
trial. The applicant monitored cardiac events with standard methods; ECG, AEs and vital signs monitoring 
and  cardiac  events  as  part  of  routine  pharmacovigilance.  Two  patients  with  documented  abnormal 
clinically significant ECGs had other more likely causes for this than EV. 
The  causes  of  death  were  mainly  related  to  infections,  organ  dysfunction  (including  liver  and  kidney 
related  AEs),  and  the  AESI  hyperglycaemia  (including  ketoacidosis).  Going  through  the  narratives  of 
study 301/EV-arm all deaths not considered by the applicant as drug-related (except one) were in the 
setting of progressive disease.  
Although the incidence of febrile neutropenia was higher in the chemotherapy arm, the SAE incidence of 
Infections  and  Infestations  (SOC)  was  higher  in  the  EV  arm  (17.6%)  compared  to  the  chemotherapy 
arm (11.7%).  
The incidence of discontinuation was comparable between the arms in study 301 and to study 201/C1.  
A safety summary for drug interactions is not available due to the low number of subjects taking CYP3A4 
inhibitors (see SmPC 4.5). Patients receiving concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should be monitored 
more closely for signs of toxicities. 
Safety in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment is unknown, which has been stated in the 
SPC.

Given the mechanism of action (microtubule-disrupting agent) a potential for carcinogenicity could be 
expected.    As  enfortumab  vedotin  is  intended  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  late  stage  and 
advanced cancer the omission of carcinogenicity studies has been accepted.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Several  adverse  events  specifically  related  to  enfortumab  vedotin  have  been  identified.  The  most 
concerning events are severe skin reactions including fatal cases, hyperglycaemia, and polyneuropathy. 
Gastrointestinal adverse events affecting QoL are also of importance. In conclusion, the safety profile of 
enfortumab vedotin is clinically manageable and do not give rise to major objections.  
2.7.  Risk Management Plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version 0.5 with this application.  
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 0.5 is acceptable.

Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 18.12.2019. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.8.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that enfortumab vedotin has not been previously authorised in a medicinal 
product in the European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers enfortumab vedotin to be a new active substance as 
it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union.

2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Padcev (enfortumab vedotin) is included in 
the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The approved indication for enfortumab vedotin is as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients 
with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer who have previously received a platinum-
containing chemotherapy and a programmed death receptor 1 or programmed death ligand 1 inhibitor. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There is not an established standard of care in the post-platinum post-immunotherapy (anti PD-1/PD-
L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor) setting for patients with advanced urothelial cancer. Chemotherapy 
choices include taxanes and vinflunine, but historically only approximately 10% of patients respond 
after platinum-based chemotherapy, irrespective of whether they have received prior PD-1/PD-L1 
inhibitors, creating a significant unmet medical need for these patients. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The  main  evidence of  efficacy of  enfortumab  vedotin  submitted  comes  from  Study  EV-301  (7465-CL-
0301)  a  global,  open-label,  randomised  phase  III  study  in  adult  subjects  with  locally  advanced  or 
metastatic  UC  who  had  received  a  platinum-containing  chemotherapy  and  had  experienced  disease 
progression or relapse during or following treatment with PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors. The primary endpoint 
was OS. Secondary endpoints include PFS, ORR, disease control rate (DCR), DOR, safety, tolerability, 
quality  of  life  and  patient-reported  outcome  parameters.  The  primary  analysis  of  PFS,  ORR,  DCR  and 
DOR  was  based  on  RECIST  v1.1  as  assessed  by  the  investigator.  Cross-over  from  chemotherapy  to 
Enfortumab  Vedotin  was  allowed  after  the  results  from  the  interim  analysis  were  considered  final 
(protocol V4). 
Assessment report  
EMA/249357/2022 
Page 183/188 
 
 
 
 
 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
At data cutoff, after 49.5% of OS events, pivotal study EV-301 met its primary endpoint: OS in the EV 
arm  shows  statistical  superiority  over  chemotherapy  [HR  for  OS  0.70  (95%  CI  0.56,  0.89),  p-value 
0.00142]. K-M estimates of median OS are 12.9 months in the EV arm and  9.0 in the chemotherapy 
arm. The OS benefit from EV vs. chemo remains across diverse sensitivity analyses –also accounting for 
the effect of cross-over– and most of the predefined subgroups. Updated data from the final analysis of 
OS (data cutoff 30-JUL-2021) with 73% of event maturity provided consistent results with HR remaining 
0.70 (95% CI 0.58, 0.85).  
The PFS benefit in the EV arm is consistent with OS results: At 71% of PFS events, HR for PFS1 was 0.62 
(95% CI 0.51, 0.75), p-value <0.00001. K-M estimates of median PFS1 were 5.6 months in the EV arm 
and 3.7 in the chemotherapy arm. 
Confirmed ORR rate was 41% in the EV arm and 18% in the chemo arm. K-M estimates of median DOR 
were  numerically  longer  in  the  chemo  arm  (8.1  months)  than  the  EV  arm  (7.4  months),  but  the  12-
month  landmark  analyses  of  DOR  suggest  improved  performance  of  EV  (28%  still  on  response)  vs. 
chemo (20%). 
Median PFS2 was numerically longer in the EV arm (9.6 months) as compared to the chemo arm (7.0 
months). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
A survival advantage is not unequivocally established in the female subgroup (23% of ITT, HR for OS 
1.17, 95% CI 0.72, 1.89), but since the pattern of worse survival for female patients with bladder 
cancer seems established and attributable to a multiplicity of factors (Donsky et al, 2013; Liu et al, 
2015), clinical plausibility of the findings from EV-301 appears unlikely.   
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The most common TEAEs occurring in ≥ 20% of subjects in the enfortumab vedotin arm were alopecia, 
decreased  appetite,  fatigue,  diarrhea,  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy,  pruritus,  nausea,  constipation, 
dysgeusia, and pyrexia.  
The incidence of all skin reactions and severe cutaneous adverse reactions in the EV arm in study EV-
301 compared to the chemotherapy arm (53.7% / 26.0% vs 19.9% / 9.3%) was high.   
Peripheral neuropathy occurred commonly in the enfortumab vedotin-treated subjects (50.3% in the EV-
arm and 34.4% in the chemo-arm in study 301), mainly at low grades; few subjects experienced Grade 
3 events and 1 subject experienced a Grade 4 event. Peripheral neuropathy events were predominantly 
sensory  in  nature.  Peripheral  neuropathy  was  the  most  common  adverse  event  overall  leading  to 
treatment  discontinuation  in  the  enfortumab  vedotin  safety  population  (4.8  %  in  study  301  EV  arm 
compared to 2.1% in the chemo-arm and 7.2 % in study 201/C1). 
Hyperglycaemia is a key adverse event of interest. In Study EV-301, 11.8% of subjects in the EV arm 
and 2.7% in the Chemo-arm had any hyperglycaemic event, with Grade 3-4 hyperglycaemia occurring 
in 21 patients (7.1%;) in the EV arm and in 2 patients (0.7%) in the chemotherapy arm. A fatal case 
due to hyperglycaemia occurred in the enfortumab vedotin arm. Data in particular from the randomised 
study 301 suggested that hyperglycaemia events were more common in subjects with a baseline BMI ≥ 
Assessment report  
EMA/249357/2022 
Page 184/188 
 
 
 
 
 
30  kg/m2  and  in  patients  with  a  prior  medical  history  of  hyperglycaemia  who  were  treated  with 
enfortumab vedotin.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
•  Long-term safety data is scarce. In the updated main safety population (Study EV-301 and 201/C1) 
only 54 patients received enfortumab vedotin for ≥ 1 year. Long-term safety has been added to the 
Summary of Safety concerns as Missing information (see RMP).  
•  A  safety  summary  for  drug  interactions  is  not  available  due  to  the  low  number  of  subjects  taking 
CYP3A4 inhibitors (see SmPC 4.5). Patients receiving concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors should 
be monitored more closely for signs of toxicities. 
•  Safety in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment is unknown, which has been stated in 
the SPC 
•  Given the mechanism of action (microtubule-disrupting agent) a potential for carcinogenicity could 
be  expected.  As  enfortumab  vedotin  is  intended  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  late  stage  and 
advanced cancer the omission of carcinogenicity studies has been accepted.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Untreated locally advanced or metastatic urothelial cancer is associated with median survival time rarely 
exceeding 4-6 months. Once patients are beyond platinum and immunotherapy, treatment choices are 
scarce. Taxanes and vinflunine evoke modest response rates and are often used in the few patients who 
maintain  an  appropriate  clinical  status  to  consider  further  treatment.  As  such,  this  population  was 
enrolled in the comparator arm of the phase III trial EV-301, designed after promising response rates 
from enfortumab vedotin (EV) in preceding phase I and II studies on akin patient populations. The open-
label nature of the trial is understandable in view of the multiple treatment choices in the control arm, 
and hence the importance of prioritising survival as the primary endpoint, with all other investigator-
assessed endpoints as secondary. 
Results  of  the  interim  analysis  –now  considered  final–  outline  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically 
relevant survival advantage of the experimental EV arm over the chemotherapy arm. This benefit is seen 
across the majority of secondary endpoints and remains consistent in diverse sensitivity analysis of OS 
and PFS. Importantly, median PFS2 is also numerically longer in the experimental arm, supporting the 
notion  that  the  survival  advantage  is  specifically  increased  with  EV.  Upon  these  results,  as  the  last 
amendment to the protocol states, crossover to EV upon progression will be offered to the few patients 
still ongoing treatment in the chemotherapy arm.  
Subgroup analysis of survival showed benefit from EV over chemotherapy across most subgroups, except 
for the female subpopulation, but since clinical plausibility for this effect is not evident, this issue was 
not further pursued. Albeit results from the initial analyses suggested that a survival advantage was not

apparent in low nectin-4 expressors, data from the final analysis of OS does not allow to conclude that 
efficacy is affected by nectin-4 expression in the biomarker-available population. 
The  overall  toxicity  profile  of  EV  appears  similar  to  chemotherapy,  with  the  most  common  AEs  being 
alopecia,  decreased  appetite,  fatigue,  diarrhoea,  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy,  pruritus,  nausea, 
constipation, dysgeusia, and pyrexia. The main AEs of special interest were skin reactions, neuropathy, 
and hyperglycaemia. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Considering the clinically relevant improvement in overall survival and the acceptable safety profile, it 
can be concluded that the benefits of treatment with EV outweigh its risks in the post-platinum post-
immunotherapy treatment setting of advanced Urothelial Cancer. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable.  
Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Padcev (enfortumab vedotin) is positive subject to the conditions 
stated in section ‘Recommendations’.

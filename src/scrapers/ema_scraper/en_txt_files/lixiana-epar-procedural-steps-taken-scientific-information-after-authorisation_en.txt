authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to 
update the list of local representatives for Portugal in 
the Package Leaflet and to bring the PI in line with the

performed no later than 12 hours after the dose of Lixiana 
on the day of the procedure. 
For all patients undergoing cardioversion, confirmation 
should be sought prior to cardioversion that the patient has 
taken Lixiana as prescribed. Decisions on initiation and 
duration of treatment should follow established guidelines 
for anticoagulant treatment in patients undergoing

Executive Summary  
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers in both men and women, and the second 
most common cause of cancer mortality in Europe. Significant advances in the treatment of metastatic 
CRC have been made during the last 25 years with the introduction of chemotherapy agents. Current 
therapies used in clinical practice for first and second line treatment of metastatic CRC include 
irinotecan or oxaliplatin, each in combination with bolus and infusional 5FU/ LV. Standard second-line 
treatments for metastatic CRC have also evolved to include the addition of targeted biologic therapies 
such as bevacizumab, cetuximab and panitumumab. Despite these advances, the prognosis of patients 
with metastatic CRC undergoing second-line treatment is poor and the expected median overall 
survival is only approximately one year. 
In November 2012, the European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(CHMP) recommended the authorisation of aflibercept (Zaltrap) in combination with 
irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/folinic acid (FOLFIRI) chemotherapy in the treatment of adults with metastatic 
colorectal cancer (MCRC) that is resistant to or has progressed after an oxaliplatin-containing regimen. 
The recommended dose of aflibercept, administered as an intravenous infusion over 1 hour, is 4 mg/kg 
of body weight, followed by the FOLFIRI regimen. This is considered as one treatment cycle. The 
treatment cycle is repeated every 2 weeks.  
Aflibercept is a recombinant human fusion protein that acts as a high-affinity soluble decoy receptor 
that can block the VEGF pathway by preferentially binding to vascular endothelial growth factor A 
(VEGF-A), VEGF-B and placenta growth factor (PlGF) and preventing these factors from activating their 
endogenous receptors. By blocking this pathway, aflibercept is believed to exert direct anti-cancer 
activity and to potentiate the anti-cancer activity of chemotherapy agents by preventing new tumour 
vessel growth, regressing existing tumour vessels, normalising vasculature, affecting tumour cell 
function, offsetting of effects of chemotherapy induction of VEGF levels and potentially inhibiting VEGF 
repression of dendritic cell function. 
The demonstration of clinical benefit for aflibercept was based on a single randomised, double-blind 
controlled trial of aflibercept versus placebo in MCRC patients being treated with FOLFIRI after failure 
of an oxaliplatin based regimen (EFC10262- VELOUR). The primary efficacy analysis showed a small 
but clinically significant difference of 1.44 months in median overall survival between the study groups. 
In this trial, the risk of death associated with aflibercept was reduced by 18% compared to that 
observed in the control group (stratified Hazard Ratio 0.817, Confidence Interval: 0.713 to 0.937, 
p=0.0032). The median overall survival was 13.5 months in the aflibercept arm compared to 12.1 
months in the placebo arm. Secondary efficacy endpoints were consistent with the effect observed in 
terms of overall survival. Aflibercept was associated with an improvement of 2.23 months in duration 
of median progression-free survival and of 9% in objective response rate (19.8% versus 11.1% for 
aflibercept and placebo, respectively).  
The trial also included a subgroup of patients whose disease had progressed after treatment with 
bevacizumab. Bevacizumab has a mechanism of action similar to that of aflibercept. Because of the 
risk of cross-resistance between the two agents, a subgroup analysis was conducted to assess if an 
effect of aflibercept could be observed also in patients pre-treated with bevacizumab. In this subgroup 
analysis, a trend towards a favourable effect on overall survival was observed for aflibercept, but no 
definitive conclusions could be drawn. 
Treatment-emergent adverse events led to permanent discontinuation of treatment in 26.8% of 
patients in the aflibercept arm compared to 12.1% of patients in the placebo arm, clearly reflecting the 
toxic potential of the study drug when combined with FOLFIRI. Furthermore, substantially more dose

modifications and premature discontinuation of all study drugs as well as cycle delays were seen in the 
experimental arm. However, overall exposure to background chemotherapy (irinotecan and 5-
fluorouracil) on study was similar between the two treatment groups. Aflibercept was associated with 
anti-VEGF class side effects including hypertension, haemorrhage and fistulae. Addition of aflibercept 
also increased the frequency of adverse events associated with irinotecan and 5-FU, including 
diarrhoea, neutropenia, and stomatitis. Severe treatment-emergent adverse events occurred in 83.5% 
of patients in the aflibercept arm compared to 62.5% in the placebo arm. Severe events with a 
frequency ≥2% higher in the aflibercept arm included diarrhoea, hypertension, asthenic conditions, 
stomatitis and ulceration, and dehydration. Serious treatment-emergent adverse events (defined as 
events that are life-threatening, result in death, require in patient hospitalisation or prolong 
hospitalisation, result in persistent or significant disability, are congenital anomalies/birth defects or 
require intervention to prevent permanent impairment or damage) were reported in 48.1% of patients 
in the aflibercept arm compared to 32.7% in the placebo arm. The most common serious adverse 
events were gastrointestinal disorders (20% vs 11%) followed by infection and infestations (11.3% vs 
6.3%). In patients ≥65 years the incidence of specific AEs, such as diarrhoea, dizziness, asthenia, 
weight decrease and dehydration was ≥5% higher than in the younger population.  
In terms of balance of benefits and risks, the overall toxicity of aflibercept in the studied combination 
regimen was considered significant, not always manageable, and in some patients ultimately leading to 
termination also of the chemotherapy. However, despite this toxicity, there was still a small but 
clinically relevant survival advantage of 1.44 months (median). Thus, the benefits associated with 
aflibercept were considered to outweigh the risks. 
In order to optimise benefit–risk balance, it is essential to identify the proper target population for 
therapy. This might be possible to accomplish through the judicious use of biomarkers in all phases of 
clinical drug development. However, no validated predictive serum or plasma biomarkers have been 
identified during the development of aflibercept that correlate with treatment outcomes. Thus, the 
CHMP has requested to the applicant company to analyse plasma and tissue samples from the 
available trials, with the primary aim to identify biomarkers to allow better selection of the population 
likely to experience a beneficial effect following treatment with aflibercept.  
Finally, individual patient decisions should be based on clinical judgement and also take into account 
patient preferences.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Colorectal cancer (CRC) is one of the most common cancers in both men and women, and the second 
most common cause of cancer mortality in Europe (Ferlay et al, 2010). In 2011 more than 1.2 million 
new cases, and more than 600.000 deaths was attributed to colorectal cancer worldwide (Jemal et al, 
2011). In approximately 60% of CRC patients the initial diagnosis is carried out at late stages of 
disease which are characterised by a poor prognosis. In particular, the 5-year survival of metastatic 
colorectal cancer (MCRC) is around 12% (American Cancer Society, 2005). 
Significant advances in the treatment of MCRC have been made in a step-wise way during the last 20-
25 years, due to the introduction of active agents (5-FU, LV, irinotecan, oxaliplatin) and their use at 
different doses and schedule (ie, bolus and continuous infusion). Current therapies recognised in 
clinical practice as the standard of care for first and second line treatment of MCRC include irinotecan 
or oxaliplatin, each in combination with bolus and infusional 5FU/ LV (FOLFIRI and FOLFOX, 
respectively). No correlation between sequence of administration of the two regimens in first or second 
line and clinical efficacy have been reported (Tournigand et al, 2004). In current clinical practice, 
patients with MCRC who have received first-line oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy (ie, oxaliplatin/5-
FU/leucovorin [LV]) typically receive second-line treatment with irinotecan-based chemotherapy. 
Current standard second-line treatments for MCRC have also evolved to include the addition of 
targeted biologic therapies to the combination of 5-FU/LV with irinotecan. Targets for biologic therapies 
include VEGF and EGFR. MCRC is one of the first malignancies in which a clear benefit was 
demonstrated with an anti-VEGF treatment combined with chemotherapy in randomised clinical 
studies. Bevacizumab is a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody that inhibits angiogenesis 
through binding to VEGF. Cetuximab and panitumumab are anti-epidermal growth factor receptor 
(EGFR) monoclonal antibodies approved for use in patients with MCRC whose tumours harbour wild-
type KRAS. 
Aflibercept is a recombinant human fusion protein, composed of domain 2 from VEGFR-1 fused to 
domain 3 from VEGFR-2 attached to the hinge region of the Fc(a) domain of human immunoglobulin, 
acting as a high-affinity soluble decoy receptor that can block the VEGF pathway by preferentially 
binding to VEGF-A, VEGF-B and PlGF and preventing these factors from activating their endogenous 
receptors. It exhibits high binding affinity for the VEGF-A isoforms VEGF165 and VEGF121, VEGF-B, 
PlGF-1, and PIGF-2 but not for VEGF-C or VEGF-D. 
VEGF-A is a major mediator of tumour angiogenesis through its effects on endothelial cell survival, 
migration and proliferation. Initially discovered as a vascular permeability factor, VEGF-A also 
decreases barrier function of the endothelium and may be a cause of the increased extravasation of 
macromolecules from tumour-associated vessels. Other members of the VEGF gene family include 
VEGF-B, VEGF-C, VEGF-D, VEGF-E and PlGF. Various VEGF family members are processed as different 
splice isoforms that differ in molecular weight and degree of binding to the extracellular matrix. For 
example, tumour-derived VEGFA generally occurs as VEGF121 and VEGF165 isoforms. 
VEGF-A binds to two receptor tyrosine kinases, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2, to promote angiogenesis. The 
receptors VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 are found predominantly on the surface of vascular endothelial cells 
and, upon binding to VEGF-A, become phosphorylated and activate intracellular signals to promote cell 
survival, migration and proliferation. VEGFR-1 is also expressed by some leukocytes. PlGF binds only to 
VEGFR-1 and NRP1/NRP2, and may stimulate vessel formation directly by acting on endothelial cells, 
Zaltrap 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 10/91 
 
 
 
or indirectly by recruiting leukocytes and endothelial progenitor cells. A third receptor VEGFR-3, which 
binds VEGF-C and VEGF-D, is mainly involved in the regulation of lymphatic vessels (Figure 1).  
Figure 1: The VEGF pathway 
As a VEGFR binding antagonist, aflibercept is believed to exert direct anti-cancer activity and to 
potentiate the anti-cancer activity of chemotherapy agents through a variety of modes of actions. 
These include prevention of new tumour vessel growth, regression of existing tumour vessels, vascular 
normalisation, direct effects on tumour cell function, offsetting of effects of chemotherapy induction of 
VEGF levels, and inhibition of VEGF repression of dendritic cell function. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: Zaltrap in combination with irinotecan-
fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy is indicated in adults with metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC) 
previously treated with an oxaliplatin-containing regimen. 
The finally approved indication is: Zaltrap in combination with irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/folinic acid 
(FOLFIRI) chemotherapy is indicated in adults with metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC) that is 
resistant to or has progressed after an oxaliplatin-containing regimen. 
The recommended dose of Zaltrap, administered as an intravenous infusion over 1 hour, is 4 mg/kg of 
body weight, followed by the FOLFIRI regimen. This is considered as one treatment cycle. The 
treatment cycle is repeated every 2 weeks.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Aflibercept (VEGF Trap) is a fusion protein synthetised by Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells as a 
dimeric, secreted, soluble glycoprotein. Aflibercept has a protein molecular weight of 97 kDa and 
contains glycosylation, constituting an additional 15% of the total molecular mass, resulting in a total 
molecular weight of 115 kDa. Aflibercept is composed of domain 2 from VEGFR-1 (VEGF Receptor 1) 
Zaltrap 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 11/91 
 
 
 
 
(Flt-1) fused to domain 3 from VEGFR-2 (VEGF Receptor 2) (KDR, Flk-1), which is then fused to the 
hinge region of the Fc (a) domain of human immunoglobulin G1. 
Aflibercept drug product is packaged as a concentrate for solution for infusion at 25 mg/mL. Aflibercept 
drug product is a sterile, clear, colourless to pale yellow, non-pyrogenic, preservative free solution, and 
is supplied as 100 mg and 200 mg single-use vials delivering 4 mL and 8 mL of 25 mg/mL aflibercept 
solution, respectively.  
Aflibercept drug product has been formulated specifically for intravenous (IV) administration. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Zaltrap is formulated from aflibercept drug substance.  
The production process is typical for a recombinant-Fc fusion protein. The upstream process includes 
expansion of the CHO host cells and expression of recombinant aflibercept. The downstream process 
involves clarification and purification of the protein from the culture medium.  
Aflibercept drug substance is a recombinant human soluble fusion protein designed to provide 
pharmacological blockade of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) pathway through high 
affinity, specific binding to the VEGF ligand family members, VEGF-A, placenta growth factor (PlGF), 
and VEGF-B.  
Aflibercept is a dimeric glycoprotein with a protein molecular weight of 97 kDa and contains 
glycosylation, constituting an additional 15% of the total molecular mass, resulting in a total molecular 
weight of 115 kDa. 
Manufacture 
Manufacturer 
The drug substance is manufactured and released by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc., New-York, USA.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacturing process is initiated with the thawing and inoculation of one working cell bank (WCB) 
vial.  The cell culture is expanded until reaching sufficient density for inoculation into the production 
bioreactor.  
The downstream process consists of several chromatography steps (protein A affinity chromatography, 
Cation exchange chromatography, Anion exchange chromatography and Hydrophobic Interaction 
chromatography), and includes viral inactivation and filtration steps to clear potential adventitious viral 
agents. After processing through the step of concentration/diafiltration, the drug substance is filled into 
containers and stored frozen. 
No reprocessing is claimed for the standard manufacturing of the product. 
The drug substance manufacturing process was generally well described. In general, the in process 
control system is appropriate, including adequate tests to control consistency in product as well as to 
prevent or reduce bioburden, mycoplasma and adventitious viruses. The limits set for control of 
process parameters were satisfactorily justified.  
The construction of the expression vector and the establishment of the production cell line were 
appropriately described. The characterisation of the MCB, WCBs and EPCBs were performed in 
accordance with relevant guidelines. The specifications for control of new WCBs were considered 
Zaltrap 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 12/91 
 
 
 
acceptable. Limits are in place to control the maximum time/population doubling level in the 
production of new WCBs. 
Process Validation 
The studies reported from the validation of production in the commercial scale were considered 
acceptable, supporting consistent production.  
Manufacturing process development 
The manufacturing process evolved over the course of development through three process changes 
where the main objectives of the process modifications were to increase the scale and improve 
productivity and process yields. Comparability of product derived from the different production 
processes used in development has been demonstrated. 
Specification 
Characterisation 
Aflibercept has been extensively characterised for elucidation of the primary, secondary and tertiary 
structure. Characterisation studies confirmed the homodimeric structure of the protein, its amino acid 
sequence, the C-terminal sequence, the molecular weight, the expected pattern of disulphide bonds, 
the carbohydrate profile including the content in sialic acid, the quantitative monosaccharide 
composition, the profiling of oligosaccharide structures and the presence of N-linked carbohydrates.  
Adequate information was provided as regards product-related impurities (molecular variants of 
aflibercept resulting from various types of degradation). Process related impurities are reduced to an 
acceptable level during the manufacturing process. 
Control of Drug Substance 
The tests selected for control of drug substance specifications were overall considered appropriate.  
Host cell proteins, DNA, Protein A, bioburden and endotoxins are routinely tested at release.  
The purity is tested by SDS-PAGE and Size Exclusion HPLC, while charge heterogeneity is monitored by 
Isoelectric  Focusing.  Deamidation  is  also  monitored  on  a  routine  basis  by  enzyme-linked  detection  of 
isoaspartate with reversed-phase HPLC. 
A cell based bioassay and a binding assay were designed to evaluate potency. 
The  analytical  procedures  used  to  control  the  quality  of  the  drug  substance  were  appropriately 
validated. 
Container closure system 
Two container closure systems can alternatively be used for storage of the drug substance: 
polyethylene vinyl acetate bags and polycarbonate bottles. 
Stability 
Real-time stability data up to 24 months are available for three conformance batches showing that for 
most parameters the drug substance remains stable over the proposed storage time of 24 months and 
under the proposed conditions at -20°C protected from light.

2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Aflibercept drug product is manufactured by formulation of aflibercept drug substance with sucrose and 
polysorbate 20 (stabilisers), sodium chloride, citrate buffer, and sodium phosphate buffer, adjusted to 
final pH. Aflibercept (VEGF Trap, AVE0005) Drug Product is supplied in two drug product presentations: 
- a presentation at 100 mg / 4.0 mL (nominal concentration). 
- a second presentation at 200 mg / 8.0 mL (nominal concentration). 
Both presentations are manufactured from the same bulk sterile solution at 25 mg/mL of aflibercept. 
Prior to infusion to the patient, the concentrate solution is diluted with 0.9% sodium chloride solution 
or 5% dextrose. 
Manufacture of the product 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacturing process for the drug product is straightforward, including conventional steps for 
thawing, dissolving, mixing, pH-adjusting, sterile filtering and filling of product.  
The manufacturing processes for each presentation are generally well described, appropriately 
controlled and acceptably validated, including the bioburden reduction filtration, hold times, aseptic 
filling, container closure integrity and shipping. 
An acceptable review is provided of the studies conducted in development of drug product.  
In general, the in process control system is appropriate, including adequate tests to control 
consistency in product. 
Process Validation 
Validation of the commercial process has been satisfactorily conducted. The proposed procedures for 
validation of reprocessing under the defined conditions are considered acceptable. Studies supporting 
shipping of product are acceptable. 
Product specification 
Control of drug product 
The tests identified for control by drug product specifications were in general considered appropriate.  
Testing for sterility and endotoxin content is routinely performed at release. 
As  for  the  drug  substance,  the  purity  is  tested  by  SDS-PAGE  and  Size  Exclusion  HPLC,  while  charge 
heterogeneity and deamidation are monitored by Isoelectric Focusing and enzyme-linked detection of 
isoaspartate with reversed-phase HPLC, respectively.   
The potency is determined using a cell-based bioassay and a binding assay. 
The analytical procedures used to control the drug product quality were appropriately validated. 
Container closure system 
The drug product is filled into 5 mL or 10 mL, Type 1, clear borosilicate glass vial and capped with a 
flanged cap with tear-off lid and inserted rubber sealing disc, Flurotec® coated.

Stability of the product 
The recommended storage conditions for aflibercept concentrate for solution for infusion at 100 mg/4 
mL and 200 mg/8 mL are based on primary stability results on three batches of aflibercept concentrate 
at 100 mg/4 mL and three batches at 200 mg/8 mL.  
These batches were manufactured at ¾ of the full scale with the final drug product process from full-
scale batches of drug substance final process packed in EVA bags. Batches were packaged in the 
commercial packaging. 36-Month results under long-term conditions (5°C ± 3°C) are available on 
these batches. 
Comprehensive data were reported and in general, the results support the product shelf-life of 36 
months and storage conditions (2-8°C protected from light). 
Adventitious agents 
The overall viral safety of Zaltrap is considered satisfactory. The manufacturing process does not 
directly use any materials of biological origin. Cell banks were extensively controlled and no viral 
contaminants other than retroviral-like particles normally seen in CHO cells were observed.  
Global reduction factors reported in viral clearance studies were satisfactory for both enveloped viruses 
as well as for non-enveloped viruses. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
No major objections were raised during the assessment of the quality part of the dossier.  
The Applicant has responded satisfactorily to all of the other quality concerns and questions identified 
in the Day 120 List of Questions and in the Day 180 List of Outstanding Issues. 
Concerning the specifications for the drug substance, the proposed limits were generally set too wide 
and, based on manufacturing history and clinical experience, most specifications were tightened by the 
Applicant. Likewise, the proposed limits for the drug product were generally considered too wide and 
were re-evaluated during the course of the procedure. Most acceptance limits were subsequently 
tightened. 
The absence of test to control oxidation in the specifications for the drug substance and the choice of 
the ligand in the cell based bioassay were discussed and justified by the Applicant during the course of 
the evaluation. 
The Western blot method, performed as identity test for the release of the drug substance and drug 
product, displayed a non specific background binding with the products tested other than Aflibercept. 
The Applicant committed to improve the assay by further reducing the non specific background. 
A slightly deviant trend observed during stability studies between the drug substance stored in bags 
and that stored in bottles was discussed with the Applicant. Adequate justification to support storage in 
both types of containers was provided. Furthermore, satisfactory data was provided to support storage 
under the recommended conditions, showing that no trend can be identified for the drug substance 
stored at -20°C. 
The  Applicant  confirmed  during  the  procedure  its  manufacturing  practice  to  aseptically  fill  the  bulk 
sterile solution as soon as possible after sterile filtration and the maximum hold time between filtration 
and filling was justified. The Applicant committed to introduce a point-of-fill filtration in the production 
of the drug product.

In  conclusion,  information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  drug  substance  and  drug 
product  has  been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out  indicate 
satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn 
lead  to  the  conclusion  that  the  product  should  have  a  satisfactory  and  uniform  performance  in  the 
clinic. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
Based on the review of the data on quality, the manufacture and control of the aflibercept drug 
substance and the Zaltrap drug product are considered acceptable.  
The Quality of the product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in satisfactory way.  
Data has been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
•  Drug Substance: The Applicant is recommended to improve the method used for control of 
identity of the active substance, by further reducing the non-specific background of the assay. 
•  Drug Product: The Applicant is recommended to perform studies for introduction on a point-of-
fill filtration in the production of finished product. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In vivo pharmacodynamic studies were conducted in immunocompromised mice. Pharmacokinetic (PK) 
and toxicokinetic (TK) studies were conducted in mice, rats, and cynomolgus monkeys. Single-dose 
toxicity studies were conducted in rats and repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted in mice, rats 
and cynomolgus monkeys. An embryofoetal development study and a local tolerance study were 
conducted in rabbits. Safety pharmacology was investigated as part of the general repeat-dose 
toxicology studies in mice, rats, rabbits and monkeys. With the exception of studies to evaluate the 
effects of aflibercept on cardiovascular and renal systems in mice, all safety pharmacology studies 
were claimed to have been conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practices (GLP). Repeat-
dose toxicity studies in rats and monkeys, one of the two single-dose toxicity studies in rats, one rabbit 
embryofoetal development study, the rabbit local tolerance study and the human tissue cross reactivity 
study were also claimed to have been conducted in accordance with GLP. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
The equilibrium dissociation constants, KD for the interaction of aflibercept to nine VEGF family related 
ligands from human (monkey), mouse, rat and rabbit were determined by surface plasmon resonance 
technology (Table 1).

Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC), which express VEGF receptors can be cultured in vitro 
and their activation can be induced by exogenously added VEGF. The HUVECs were used to assess the 
ability of aflibercept to block VEGF-A165 dependent VEGFR-2 phosphorylation (Table 2).

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacology studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No specific in vivo safety pharmacology studies were conducted but the potential undesirable 
pharmacodynamic effects of aflibercept on physiological functions were investigated as part of the 
general repeat-dose toxicology studies in mice, rats, rabbits or monkeys.  
No significant direct treatment-related effects that could be related to an impairment of the central 
nervous system were observed in cynomolgus monkeys dosed subcutaneously at 1.5, 5, 15, and 30 
mg/kg/adm twice a week for 3 months, intravenously at 2, 10, and 30 mg/kg/adm once a week for 1 
month, intravenously at 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg/adm once a week for 3 months, or intravenously at 3, 
10, and 30 mg/kg/adm once a week for 15 weeks and then once every other week up to Week 27.

No significant treatment-related effects on ECG parameters were observed in cynomolgus monkeys 
dosed SC at 1.5, 5, 15, and 30 mg/kg twice a week for 3 months,  IV at 2, 10, and 30 mg/kg/ adm 
once a week for 1 month, IV at 3, 10, and 30 mg/kg once a week for 3 months,  or IV at 3, 10, and 30 
mg/kg once a week for 15 weeks and then once every other week up to Week 27. 
SC administrations of aflibercept (12.5 or 25 mg/kg for 2 weeks) resulted in statistically significant 
reductions in microvessel density in the following normal tissues: liver, pancreatic islets and thyroid 
follicles at all doses and time points evaluated. Less consistent and less marked decreases in 
microvessel density were also noted in the anterior or posterior pituitary gland and adipose tissue. No 
decreases in microvessel density were detected in the adrenal gland (medulla and cortex), duodenum, 
exocrine pancreas or retina at any dose level or time point. 
The potential effects of aflibercept on blood pressure were evaluated after a single subcutaneous 
administration at doses of 0, 2.5 and 25 mg/kg in telemetered C57BL/6 mice and at doses of 0, 0.05, 
0.15, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10 and 25 mg/kg in telemetered Wistar-Kyoto rats (3 to 9 animals/group). Blood 
pressure and/or heart rate were recorded from at least 48 hours before treatment up to 3 to 4 weeks 
after treatment. 
Aflibercept induced a moderate, sustained increase in blood pressure in rats and mice at doses (2.5 
mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg and above, respectively) lower than the active dose in pharmacological models. 
The duration of this increase in blood pressure was dose-related, and maximal changes in blood 
pressure were observed only at doses ≥10 mg/kg in rats, and ≥2.5 mg/kg in mice. The duration of 
blood pressure elevation was correlated with the presence of free aflibercept in the circulation, such 
that systolic and diastolic blood pressure remained elevated above pre-treatment baseline values until 
circulating aflibercept levels fell below approximately 1 μg/mL. 
Multiple classes of anti-hypertensives were found to be effective in lowering blood pressure in rats 
treated with aflibercept. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibition (Captopril, Ramipril), calcium 
modulators (Nifedipine and Hydralazine), alpha adrenergic receptor antagonism (Prazosin), and 
modulation of nitric oxide availability (Molsidomine) effectively reversed aflibercept-induced 
hypertension. 
The potential effects of aflibercept on venous and arterial thrombus formation were evaluated in the 
New Zealand White rabbit electrolytic injury model. Intravenous administration of aflibercept at dose 
levels of 0.3, 3.0, and 30 mg/kg/adm did not affect venous and arterial thrombus formation as 
assessed by activated clotting times, haematology and coagulation parameters, blood pressure, heart 
rate, blood flows (both descending aorta and right jugular vein), time elapsed between electrical 
current initiation and thrombotic occlusion or vessel weights (with associated thrombus when present) 
in an electrolytic injury model in the rabbit. 
The effects of aflibercept on the respiratory parameters were evaluated in the conscious, unrestrained 
Sprague Dawley rat (8 males/group), using whole body plethysmography, after a single 30-minute 
intravenous infusion at doses of 10, 50 and 150 mg/kg. Aflibercept did not induce any biologically 
relevant effects on the respiratory parameters regardless of the time of measurement on Day 1 after 
treatment and on Day 7. 
The subcutaneous administration of aflibercept at 25 mg/kg/adm twice a week for 4 weeks to normal, 
adult C57BL/6 male mice (6 animals/group) did not induce any biologically relevant effects on renal 
function. 
The effects of aflibercept on wound repair and healing were evaluated in a New Zealand White rabbit 
incisional wound healing model. Aflibercept was administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion on 
Days -2, 3, 7 and 11; Day 1 corresponded to model induction. Wound tensile strength was reduced on 
Days 4, 8 and 12 at all doses, relative to a negative control group. The effects of aflibercept on wound 
Zaltrap 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 19/91 
 
 
 
repair and healing were also evaluated in a New Zealand White rabbit excisional wound healing model. 
Aflibercept was administered as a 30-minute intravenous infusion on Days -2, 5, 11 and 17; Day 1 
corresponded to model induction. Administration of aflibercept at 0.3, 3 and 30 mg/kg produced dose 
related effects on excisional wound healing and related parameters. At 0.3 mg/kg, impairment of 
wound repair and healing was noted mainly on day 8 characterised by a reduced fibrous response and 
neovascularisation relative to controls. In contrast, at the 3 and 30 mg/kg doses, neovascularisation 
was nearly undetectable at all time points evaluated (days 8, 14 and 20), and fibrous responses and 
epidermal hyperplasia were also markedly reduced. Consequently, IV administration of aflibercept at 3 
and 30 mg/kg/adm resulted in larger wound areas on days 14 and 20, compared to controls, and an 
increased incidence of open wounds on day 20. 
Finally, in order to examine any role that Fc-mediated effector function may play in aflibercept activity, 
several ex vivo cell-based assays were developed to measure complement-dependent cytotoxicity 
(CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). Aflibercept was not able to mediate 
ADCC activity in either primary human umbilical vein endothelial cells or tumour cell lines. Similarly, 
aflibercept was unable to mediate CDC activity in either primary HUVEC or tumour cell lines in contrast 
to the positive control in the assay.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of free aflibercept were determined following single dose IV and SC 
administration to mice, rats and cynomolgus monkeys, to support regimens used in non clinical 
toxicology and efficacy studies as well as the proposed clinical route of administration (IV). Aflibercept 
exposures determined in the pivotal toxicology studies are also described.  
In mice following IV administration of 1 mg/kg, free aflibercept displayed a multicompartmental serum 
PK profile. The clearance was slow, t1/2 was prolonged and distribution was slightly larger than the 
central compartment. Free aflibercept serum concentrations were still detectable at 7 days after 
dosing. Bound aflibercept exposure (Cmax and AUC) increased in a linear manner with dose between 
0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg and then rapidly approached a plateau with further increases in dose. Free 
aflibercept exposures increased in a nonlinear manner with doses between 0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg, 
becoming approximately linear with doses greater than 2.5 mg/kg.  
In rat after IV administration of 1 mg/kg, free aflibercept displayed a multi-compartmental serum 
profile. The clearance was slow, t1/2 was prolonged and the steady state volume of distribution (Vss) 
Zaltrap 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 20/91 
 
 
 
was slightly larger than the central compartment. Free aflibercept serum concentrations were still 
detectable at 7 days after dosing. The mean free aflibercept t1/2 was similar for IV and SC 
administration and bioavailability following SC dosing was 33%. 
In monkey after a single 5 mg/kg IV administration, aflibercept displayed a multicompartmental serum 
profile. Clearance was slow, the t1/2 was prolonged, and distribution was slightly larger than the 
central compartment. Free aflibercept serum concentrations from all dose groups were still detectable 
in all monkeys 14 days after dosing. 
Following a single 1 mg/kg IV dose of [125I]-aflibercept to female rats, approximately 75% of the total 
dose of radioactivity was found in the serum at 5 minutes post-dosing; at 24 hours post-dosing, this 
amount had declined to 12.3% of the dose and by 168 hours post-dosing, only 0.76% of the total 
radioactive dose remained in the serum. The highest tissue levels of radioactivity were found in the 
organs of clearance and other highly perfused tissues (11.4%, 1.33%, 0.42%, 0.34%, and 0.19% of 
the total dose of radioactivity was localised in the liver, kidney, spleen, lung and heart, respectively). 
No formal metabolism studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). Following a 
single SC dose in mice, rats or cynomolgus monkeys, free aflibercept displayed nonlinear 
pharmacokinetics. Free aflibercept clearance ranged between 0.5 and 3.5 mL/h/kg. Elimination half-life 
ranged from 2 days in the mouse to 5 days in the monkey.  At higher concentrations, in the absence of 
free aflibercept in circulation, the elimination half-life of bound aflibercept was about 7 days in mice, 
i.e., much longer than that of free aflibercept (around 1 to 2 days). In monkey repeat dose toxicology 
studies, bound aflibercept was still present in plasma 3 months after the last dose. By comparing 
bound aflibercept concentrations at steady-state and 3 months following the last dose in the 13-week 
toxicity study in monkeys, the elimination half-life of bound aflibercept was roughly estimated to be 
approximately 20 days. 
To determine the potential for renal excretion of aflibercept, single 1 mg/kg IV doses were 
administered to functionally-nephrectomised and sham-operated female rats. Comparison of the key 
indices of free aflibercept exposure (Cmax, Tmax, AUC, and t1/2) revealed no apparent differences 
between the nephrectomised and sham-operated control animals. 
No animal drug-drug interaction studies were submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
In a study aimed at investigating the potential effect of aflibercept sialylation on its PK parameters, 
different lots of aflibercept with different degrees of sialylation but with similar purity and potency, 
were administered to rats and PK parameters were determined. Above a certain threshold of 
sialylation, no difference was detected in PK parameters. Below this level, aflibercept exposure (AUC 
and MRT) was directly correlated with the degree of sialylation, with exposure decreasing (and 
clearance increasing) with decreasing degree of sialylation. The terminal volume of distribution (Vz) 
was inversely correlated with the degree of sialylation (data not shown).

males; high urinary total protein, ↓ albumin, ↓ albumin/globulin ratios, ↑ cholesterol (1 male in 30 mg/kg/adm). 
Only the Albumin/globulin ratio was resolved following the 6-week recovery phase. Haematology: Marginally 
higher red blood cell mass (red blood cell count, haemoglobin and haematocrit) was noted in both sexes at all dose 
levels on Weeks 2 and 4. This change was completely resolved on Week 10. Necropsy: Growth plate changes; ↓ 
in metaphyseal capillary invasion, ↓ in primary bony trabeculae, degeneration of the cartilage matrix, 
disorganization of the chondrocyte columns, ↑ thickening of the physeal cartilage, and transverse subchondral bony 
plate. Kidneys; very slight or slight (and moderate in 1 monkey at 30 mg/kg/adm) increase in the mesangial 
matrix (1 male following dosing at 2 mg/kg/adm, 1 male following dosing at 10 mg/kg/adm and 3 males and 2 
females following dosing at 30 mg/kg/adm). Three monkeys with kidney histopathological findings (one dosed at 10 
and two dosed at 30 mg/kg/adm) also had increased urine protein and BUN levels and decreased serum albumin 
and/or serum total protein. Changes were not completely resolved after recovery. Adrenal glands; ↓ vacuolation of 
adrenal zona fasciculata cells with cytoplasmic eosinophilia was observed at all dose levels at the end of the dosing 
period only. Ovaries; Very slight or slight decreases in numbers of maturing follicles, granulosa and/or theca cells 
(10 and 30 mg/kg/adm). Resolved at the end of recovery. Antibody formation; 2 (30 mg/kg/adm) out of 36

Findings 
Clinical signs: One male monkey dosed at 3 mg/kg/adm was euthanised prematurely on Day 182. This animal 
showed marked anaemia related to nasal bleeding, increased white blood cell, reticulocyte and neutrophil counts, 
decreased platelet counts, decreases in cholesterol, total protein, albumin, globulin and albumin/globulin ratio, 
increases in triglycerides and urea levels. Gross necropsy confirmed extensive macroscopic findings in the nasal 
cavities, including blood clots, bent nasal septum and absence of the right middle concha. Haematological evidence 
showed marked anaemia. These changes were regarded as compound-related. All aflibercept-treated groups 
showed sneezing, stained red fur, dry skin, swelling, scabbing or redness of the muzzle or lower jaw, hunched 
posture, reduced appetite, thinness and/or hypoactivity.↓ in group mean body weights were noted at all dose levels 
(0.4%, 7.8% and 20.4% for the 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg/adm groups, respectively). Initial weights were gained back 
after the recovery period. Aflibercept-treated females at all doses stopped exhibiting signs of regular menstrual 
bleeding during the dosing phase of the study. Not fully resolved during recovery. Induction of pronounced, but fully 
reversible, impaired sperm motility and abnormal sperm morphology was observed at all doses. No treatment-
related changes on electrocardiograms, blood pressure readings and body temperature. Clinical chemistry: ↑ in 
cholesterol and significant elevations in C-reactive protein in all animals at all dose levels (weeks 4, 12 and 25 for 
cholesterol and weeks 4, 13 and 26 for C-reactive protein). Changes were fully reversible. ↑ in gamma glutamyl 
transferase (GGT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and/or alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) were noted at all doses in individual males and females. Changes were not fully resolved during recovery. Mild 
increases in group mean urine microalbumin and urine protein levels in all doses. Aflibercept at ≥3 mg/kg/adm 
abrogated normal cyclical fluctuations of 17β-estradiol, progesterone, follicule stimulating hormone (FSH) and 
inhibin B. Haematology: Slight to mild increases in fibrinogen, red cell distribution width, mean platelet volume, 
platelet counts, red blood cell counts, hemoglobin, hematocrit and reticulocyte counts in males and/or females 
treated at doses of 3 mg/kg/adm and higher during dosing Weeks 4, 12 and 25. Partially or fully reversible after 
recovery. Necropsy: Bone; Femur bone mineral content (BMC) values at all treated animals were slightly lowered. 
Not fully reversible after recovery. Radiography showed an irreversible increased incidence of kyphosis, 
degenerative joint disease of vertebral articular facets, periosteal reaction of the femur and ilium. Nasal cavity (≥3 
mg/kg/adm); atrophy/loss of the septum and/or turbinates associated with necrotizing inflammation and various 
other epithelial, microvascular, cartilaginous and osseous were noted. Bone (≥ 3 mg/kg/adm); irreversible 
osteocartilaginous exostoses, exostoses in the arches of the thoracic and lumbar vertebrae. Kidneys (≥ 3 
mg/kg/adm females); ↑ eosinophilic matrix in the glomerular tuft that stained positively with the periodic acid Schiff 
reaction. Glomerulopathy, often with tubulointerstitial inflammation and/or cast formation. Not fully reversible after 
recovery. Ovaries (≥ 3 mg/kg/adm); Compromised ovarian luteal development and follicular maturation, uterine 
endometrial and myometrial atrophy and vaginal epithelial atrophy. Effects were fully reversible after recovery.  
Vascular degeneration/proliferation was noted in duodenum and gallbladder at doses ≥10 mg/kg/adm. Adrenal 
glands (≥3 mg/kg/adm); ↓ cytoplasmic vacuolation with increased cytoplasmic eosinophilia, which correlated with 
macroscopic dark discoloration. Vascular proliferation (≥ 10 mg/kg/adm); In several other tissues, including the 
heart. CNS; Macrophage infiltration in the choroid plexus. Antibody formation: Fourteen study animals developed 
anti-aflibercept antibodies (3, 4 and 7 animals out of 12 in the 3, 10 and 30 mg/kg/adm groups, respectively).

Findings 
Clinical signs: Decreased maternal body weight. Some food consumption effects in the 15 and 60 mg/kg/adm 
groups. Necropsy: Decrease in uterus weight in the high-dose group leading to a lower number of viable foetuses. 
Increase in mean number of post-implantation loss (early resorption) in the high-dose group. Malformations: 
Anasarca in 2 fetuses (including 1 polymalformed fetus) from the 3 mg/kg/adm group, ectrodactyly in 1 fetus from 
the 15 mg/kg/adm group and anasarca, gastroschisis, anal atresia and/or short tail in 9 fetuses (including 6 
polymalformed fetus) from the 60 mg/kg/adm group. Heart; Ventricular septum defect, small or enlarged 
ventricular chamber and absence of the atrioventricular valve of fetuses from dams treated at 60 mg/kg/adm. 
Great vessels and arteries; Atresia of pulmonary trunk, narrowed pulmonary trunk, overriding aorta, reduced 
pulmonary artery branch, absent or narrowed ductus arteriosus, retroesophageal or dilated aortic arch, dilated aorta 
and retroesophageal subclavian artery of fetuses from dams treated at 60 mg/kg/adm. Skeletal (including 
variations); Fused caudal vertebrae, fused or supernumerary ribs, fused sternebrae, supernumerary arch and/or 
centrum of lumbar vertebrae and absence of arch and/or centrum of sacral vertebrae, increase in the incidence of 
absent or small interparietal skull bone, incomplete ossification of the hyoid, thoracic and lumbar vertebrae, 
sternebrae, talus and forepaw and hindpaw phalanxes in fetuses from the 60 mg/kg/adm group. 
Finally, a 13-week intravenous toxicity study (670144) was specifically conducted in sexually immature 
monkeys (2 to 2.5 years of age). This study showed similar safety signals as those seen in adult 
monkeys in the repeat-dose toxicity studies (data not shown). 
Toxicokinetic data 
In general, a no-observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) was not established following IV or SC 
administration of aflibercept in monkeys. Exposure ratios of free aflibercept, calculated at the lowest 
doses associated with findings in animals by comparing average Cmax and AUC (corrected to take into 
account the different schedules of administration) to exposures observed in cancer patients after a first 
Zaltrap 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 25/91 
 
 
 
 
IV dose of 4 mg/kg (administered every 2 weeks) or 6 mg/kg (administered every 3 weeks), are 
presented in the following table 9. 
Table 9: Exposure comparisons between animals and cancer patients 
Abbreviations: AUC: area under the concentration time curve, Cmax: maximal concentration, IV: intravenous, NA: not 
applicable, ND: not determined, NOAEL: no observable adverse effect level, LOAEL: lowest observable adverse effect level, 
Tmax: time of maximal concentration. 
a Exposure ratio = Cmax or AUC values in the nonclinical toxicity studies divided by the Cmax or AUC0-∞ estimated in 
humans at doses and regimens indicated in the table. 
b Cmax and AUC0-∞ values indicated in the table were calculated after the first administration in patients. 
c Cmax was observed at Tmax of 5 minutes after completion of IV infusion. 
d All Cmax values from monkeys obtained during the 27-week dosing duration were averaged; AUC0-168h values from 
monkeys were averaged over the 27-week dosing duration, taking into account the weekly regimen applied for the first 15 
weeks and the 1q2w regimen applied during the 12 remaining weeks; the calculated AUC0-168h values were then multiplied 
by 2 or 3 to allow the calculation of exposure ratios in comparison with the 1q2w and 1q3w regimens applied in cancer 
patients dosed at 4 and 6 mg/kg, respectively. 
e Dose expressed as a LOAEL because no NOAEL was defined in this study. 
f Cmax and AUC0-168h values from monkeys obtained after 1, 5, 9 and 13 weekly administrations were averaged; the 
calculated AUC0-168h values were then multiplied by 2 or 3 to allow the calculation of exposure ratios in comparison with the 
1q2w and 1q3w regimens applied in cancer patients dosed at 4 and 6 mg/kg, respectively. 
Local Tolerance 
No compound-related local reactions were noted at the injection sites following IV, IM, and SC injection 
of 24.4 mg/mL, 25 or 100 mg/mL of aflibercept to New Zealand White rabbits. There were no 
compound-related macroscopic and microscopic observations at the end of the 8-day observation 
period. The local tolerance of aflibercept was also assessed following intravenous administration in the 
4-week, 13-week and 6-month toxicity studies conducted in cynomolgus monkeys. No compound-
related microscopic findings were noted at the injection sites in monkeys after repeated intravenous 
infusions. 
Other toxicity studies 
In human tissue cross-reactivity studies aflibercept did not cross-react with any of the 33 human 
tissues tested (data not shown). 
Serum levels of anti-aflibercept antibodies were measured during the repeat-dose toxicity studies and 
the effect of these antibodies on aflibercept clearance was determined. Repeated administration of 
aflibercept to rats and mice resulted in an anti-aflibercept antibody response (ADA) that resulted in 
increased aflibercept clearance and nephrotoxicity that was associated with mortality. This precluded 
the use of these species in sub-chronic or chronic toxicity studies. 
Zaltrap 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 26/91 
 
 
 
 
In some pregnant female rabbits, a total of five IV administrations resulted in the presence of anti-
aflibercept antibodies associated with decreased levels of free aflibercept concentrations. In no case 
was toxicity in rabbits or monkeys associated with the presence of an anti-aflibercept antibody 
response, nor was the overall safety profile modified by the presence of anti-aflibercept antibodies in 
these animals. In monkeys after IV dose, ADA responses increased in frequency with the duration of 
dosing, with up to 12% of animals being ADA positive in the 3-month study and 36% being ADA 
positive in the 6-month study. Two of the 14 animals that were ADA positive in the 6-month toxicity 
study demonstrated increased clearance of both free and bound aflibercept. 
No haemolysis nor protein precipitate were observed when mixing whole heparinised blood, serum and 
plasma from monkeys and humans with aflibercept solutions at concentrations including the ones used 
in animal toxicity studies and in clinical practice (data not shown). 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In vitro, aflibercept blocked VEGF-induced proliferation of endothelial cells and inhibited microvessel 
outgrowth from rat aorta in vitro. In vivo pharmacology studies have indicated that treatment with 
aflibercept inhibits tumour growth of a wide variety of murine, rat, and human tumour cell lines 
implanted in mice. Aflibercept treatment of several established tumours also resulted in a decrease in 
tumour vessel density.  
Aflibercept was effective in combination with several widely-used chemotherapeutic agents. 
Combination of aflibercept with the antimetabolite, 5-FU, was synergistic in inhibiting the growth of 
early mammary MA13/C tumours. Combining aflibercept with the topoisomerase I inhibitor, irinotecan, 
was also synergistic over several dose levels in advanced colon HCT 116 tumours.  
No secondary pharmacology studies were submitted. The lack of secondary pharmacology studies was 
considered acceptable by the CHMP based on the safety pharmacology studies conducted in mice, rats 
and rabbits using the intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) routes of administration to help identify 
possible sequelae of stringent systemic inhibition of VEGF. Moreover, in human tissue cross-reactivity 
studies aflibercept did not cross-react with any of the 33 human tissues tested.  
No treatment related effects on ECG parameters were observed in any of the pivotal monkey repeat-
dose toxicity studies.  
Subcutaneous administrations of aflibercept resulted in statistically significant reductions in 
microvessel density within the liver, pancreatic islets and thyroid follicles at all doses and time points 
evaluated. Less consistent and less marked decreases in microvessel density were also noted in the 
anterior or posterior pituitary gland and adipose tissue. No decreases in microvessel density were 
detected in the adrenal gland (medulla and cortex), duodenum, exocrine pancreas or retina at any 
dose level or timepoint. It has been previously shown in the mouse that a subset of capillaries remains 
dependent on VEGF into adulthood, mainly in the pancreatic islets and thyroid (Kamba, et al. 2006). 
Several other tissues have also been identified, in which a subset of the capillaries remain VEGF 
dependent, including liver, pituitary and adipose tissue. The pharmacological inhibition of VEGF has 
been shown to increase endothelial cell thickness, and reduce the number of fenestrations in the 
capillaries of several endocrine organs (Kamba, T et al.). All classes of VEGF inhibitors evaluated to 
date, irrespective of their mechanism of action, produce these structural changes in susceptible 
subsets of capillaries showing that these are class effects attributable to inhibition of the VEGF/VEGF 
Receptor signaling pathway. Hypertension has been included as an identified risk in the RMP.

A single subcutaneous administration of aflibercept induced a moderate, sustained but reversible 
increase in blood pressure in rats and mice at doses (2.5 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg and above, 
respectively) lower than the active dose in pharmacological models. Multiple classes of anti-
hypertensives were found to be effective in lowering blood pressure in rats treated with aflibercept. 
Aflibercept has also shown blood pressure effect in clinical trials (see clinical AR). Similar effects on 
blood pressure were also noted in rats receiving a single dose of cediranib, a VEGF receptor tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor (Curwen, et al. 2008). Hypertension was reported first in patients treated with 
bevacizumab and is the predominant and expected side effect of anti-VEGF therapies (Launary-Vacher, 
et al. 2009). Hypertension induced by this class of drugs is related to the role of the VEGF/VEGFR 
signaling pathway in blood pressure homeostasis (Roodhart, et al. 2008). Blocking VEGFR signaling 
can result in a decrease in the secretion of vasodilation factors (nitric oxide and prostacyclin) and/or an 
increase in the secretion of vasoconstriction factors (endothelin- 1) by the endothelial cells leading to 
an increase in peripheral vascular resistance and an increase in blood pressure (Roodhart et al, 2008), 
(Verheul, et al. 2007). Since VEGF can also induce hypotension through an endothelial baroreceptor 
signaling cascade, VEGF pathway inhibition could result in hypertension through the disturbance of the 
baroreceptor response (Verheul, et al. 2007). In addition, hypertension induced by angiogenesis 
inhibitors may be due to an inappropriate reduction in the density of capillaries and arterioles (Verheul, 
et al. 2007). 
In rabbit, impairment of wound repair and healing was noted on day 8 at 0.3 mg/kg/adm, 
characterised by a reduced fibrous response and neovascularization relative to controls. Compromised 
wound healing was also evaluated in the clinical material, see clinical AR. The signal on compromised 
wound healing is included in section 5.3 of the SmPC and as wound healing impairment was included 
as an identified risk in the RMP.  
No safety pharmacology signals on central nervous system effects were detected in any of the repeat-
dose monkey studies, no effects on thrombus formation in exposed rabbits were detected, aflibercept 
treatment did not affect the respiratory function in conscious rats and no biologically relevant renal 
effects were detected in treated mice. 
Following IV administration to mice, rats and monkeys, free aflibercept displayed a 
multicompartmental PK serum profile. Clearance was slow, t1/2 long and the Vss was slightly greater 
than the volume of the central compartment. In rats, mice and monkeys administered SC doses of 
aflibercept at multiple dose levels, a nonlinear PK profile was observed, indicative of target-mediated 
clearance. This PK profile was characterised by an increased free aflibercept t1/2 and a positive 
deviation of exposure from dose proportionality at highest aflibercept dose levels. Aflibercept SC 
bioavailability was 94% in mice, 85% in monkeys and 33% in rats. Aflibercept complex accounted for a 
significant percentage of the circulating form of the drug, with the relative percentage increasing as 
the aflibercept dose was reduced. 
A study with radioactivity-labelled aflibercept showed that 5 minutes post-dosing, approximately 
11.4%, 1.33%, 0.42%, 0.34%, and 0.19% of the total dose of radioactivity was localised in the liver, 
kidney, spleen, lung and heart respectively. 
In summary, aflibercept has a long circulating t1/2, characteristic of an IgG1 fusion protein, and is 
cleared by multiple mechanisms, which include saturable binding to endogenous VEGF as well as 
proteolytic degradation. This also gives that the maximum pharmacological consequences of aflibercept 
binding to VEGF are reached, since all VEGF is bound, at relative low doses (2.5 mg/kg, single dose, in 
mice). 
Weekly/every two weeks intravenous administration of aflibercept to cynomolgus monkeys for up to 6 
months resulted in mean body weight decrease. Initial weights were gained back after the recovery 
period. Decreased body weight was also observed in male rats. More clinical signs of toxicity in the 
Zaltrap 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 28/91 
 
 
 
longer monkey studies included: red nasal discharge, stained red fur, dry skin, swelling, scabbing or 
redness of the muzzle or lower jaw and hunched posture and kyphosis.   
Changes in clinical chemistry included high urinary total protein, high microalbumin, increased 
triglyceride levels, increased cholesterol, elevated C-reative proteins, increase in liver enzymes (GGT, 
AST, ALP, ALT) and decrease in phosphorus levels. Aflibercept abrogated normal cyclical fluctuations of 
17β-estradiol, progesterone, follicule stimulating hormone (FSH) and inhibin B. Aflibercept-treated 
females at all doses stopped exhibiting signs of regular menstrual bleeding during the dosing phase of 
the study, which was not fully resolved during recovery. Some minor changes were also observed in 
fibrinogen, red cell distribution width, mean platelet volume, platelet counts, red blood cell counts, 
haemoglobin, haematocrit and reticulocyte counts. 
Organ toxicity was noted at all doses tested and the target organs were: 
- Bone; interference with growth plate maturation of long bones and osteocartilaginous exostoses of 
vertebrae. Similar changes in the growth plate have been reported in cynomolgus monkeys 
administered recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial cell growth factor.   
- Kidney; frequently increased glomerular mesangial matrix, occasionally hyperplasia of parietal 
epithelium and periglomerular fibrosis at 30 mg/kg/adm. The renal findings were reversible when the 
recovery period was 13 weeks or longer. Kidney glomerular changes were apparently not immune 
mediated (lack of staining of glomeruli with antibody against monkey IgM, monkey IgG, or human C3 
complement) and may be related to lack of circulating VEGF. No alterations in urinalysis parameters 
reflective of impaired renal function were observed in repeat dose monkey studies with a recombinant 
humanised monoclonal antibody to vascular endothelial cell growth factor. 
- Testis; Induction of pronounced, but fully reversible, impaired sperm motility and abnormal sperm 
morphology was observed at all doses. 
- Ovary; decreased number of maturing follicles, granulosa cells and/or theca cells. Similar changes 
have been reported in cynomolgus monkeys administered recombinant humanised monoclonal 
antibody to vascular endothelial cell growth factor.   
- The respiratory and olfactory epithelium of nasal turbinates and adrenal gland.  
- Skeletal changes: decreased metaphyseal capillary invasion, decreased primary bony trabeculae, 
increased thickness of physeal cartilage, disorganization of the chondrocyte columns, and degeneration 
of the cartilage matrix. These skeletal changes showed reversibility after shorter recovery periods. 
Osteocartilaginous exostoses and degenerative joint disease were also observed and were not 
reversible following a 5-month recovery period.  
No studies evaluating carcinogenicity or mutagenicity of aflibercept were submitted in agreement with 
the ICH S6 and ICH S9 guidelines (EMA/CHMP/ICH/731268/1998 and EMEA/CHMP/ICH/646107/2008). 
No specific studies with aflibercept have been conducted in animals to evaluate the effect on fertility. 
However, results from a repeat dose toxicity study suggest there is a potential for aflibercept to impair 
reproductive function and fertility. In sexually mature female cynomolgus monkeys inhibition of 
ovarian function and follicular development was evidenced. These animals also lost normal menstrual 
cycling. In sexually mature male cynomolgus monkeys a decrease in sperm motility and an increase in 
incidence of morphological abnormalities of spermatozoa were observed. There was no margin of 
exposure to patients in relation to these effects. These effects were fully reversible within 8-18 weeks 
after the last injection. This is described in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Women of childbearing potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant while on Zaltrap, and 
should be informed of the potential hazard to the foetus. Women of childbearing potential and fertile 
Zaltrap

males should use effective contraception during and up to a minimum of 6 months after the last dose 
of treatment. This is described in section 4.6 of the SmPC. 
Aflibercept has been shown to be embryotoxic and teratogenic when administered intravenously to 
pregnant rabbits every 3 days during the organogenesis period (gestation days 6 to 18) at doses 
approximately 1 to 15 times the human dose of 4 mg/kg every 2 weeks. Observed effects included 
decreases in maternal body weights, an increased number of foetal resorptions, and an increased 
incidence of external, visceral, and skeletal foetal malformations. This is described in section 5.3 of the 
SmPC. 
The applicant has not calculated AUC-values in all presented studies, but relied on Cmax in order to 
estimate exposure margins to human. Since the presented pharmacokinetic studies indicate a target 
saturation multicompartmental serum profile and a long half-life in both rat and monkey it is agreed 
that a Cmax approach to estimate human exposure margins is acceptable. The data show no margins 
between human exposure and toxic exposure in animals.  
In local tolerance studies, no compound-related local reactions were noted at the injection site after 
either way of administration. These findings are somewhat in contradiction with the finding of injection 
site lesions in the single dose toxicity study. From a clinical point of view, injection site lesions were 
not identified as a major side effect and thus the inconclusive non-clinical data were no longer 
considered. 
In rat, most animals developed anti- aflibercept antibodies. In high-titer animals an increase in 
clearance was observed, indicating that this was antibody mediated. In low-titer animals no increase in 
clearance was observed. In the 27 week repeat-dose monkey study, some animals developed anti-drug 
antibodies (14 out of 36 animals). In two of these animals the antibodies gave rise to an increased 
clearance of aflibercept. In the rest of the animals the applicant argued that, due to the low antibody 
titer, that there was no reduction in free aflibercept levels. In the embryo-foetal study no toxicokinetic 
data were collected from the main study group and it is not known whether the presence of anti- 
aflibercept antibodies (found in 21 out of 71 animals) in the main study group influences aflibercept 
exposure levels in the dams. However, all dose groups showed maternal and embryo-foetal toxicity so 
that it is clear that the aflibercept-directed antibodies did not abolish exposure. 
Finally, the absence of an ERA was considered acceptable by the CHMP as aflibercept is made up by 
naturally occurring peptides and therefore aflibercept is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment, in accordance with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of medicinal 
products for human use (EMA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00).

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
In order to characterise the pharmacokinetics of aflibercept, two analytes were quantified in healthy 
subjects and in patients: free aflibercept (compound not complexed to VEGF) and bound aflibercept 
(VEGF: aflibercept complex in a ratio 1:1). A commercially available assay was also used to detect free 
endogenous VEGF. Finally, two methods were developed and validated to detect binding anti-
aflibercept antibodies. A comparison study of both methods demonstrated that the assay used in phase 
2 and 3 studies was more sensitive than the original assay used in phase 1 and early phase 2 studies. 
A method for detecting neutralizing anti-aflibercept antibodies was also developed and validated.

For the pharmacokinetic data analysis in healthy volunteers, a non-compartmental analysis was 
performed for free, bound and total aflibercept. Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using 
non-compartmental methods. 
For the pharmacokinetic data analysis in cancer patients, pharmacokinetic properties of free and bound 
aflibercept were determined from non-compartmental PK analysis (NCA) in single agent 
(TED6115/TED6116) and 5 combination studies (TCD6117, TCD6118, TCD6119, TCD6120 and 
TCD6121). Then, PK was characterised by population approach from a pooled dataset using data from 
TED6115/TED6116, TCD6120-VT, TCD6118, ARD6122, ARD6123 and EFC6125. These population PK 
models for free and bound aflibercept were used to estimate PK parameters in the pivotal phase 3 
study (POH0265 for EFC10262/VELOUR) as well as in phase 3 studies in other indications (POH0262 
for EFC10547/VANILLA, POH0274 for EFC10261/VITAL) after implementation of their data in the 
pooled database. 
For the population pharmacokinetic data analysis, a population pharmacokinetic (PK) model of 
aflibercept was first developed for free and bound aflibercept in 56 healthy subjects after single IV 
doses of 1 to 4 mg/kg in PDY6655 and PDY6656 Phase 1 clinical studies (POH0251). Then Phase 1 and 
2 studies were conducted in patients in which aflibercept was administered intravenously every two 
weeks as either a single agent or in combination with various chemotherapy drugs at dose levels 
ranging from 2.0 to 6.0 mg/kg every two weeks or from 2.0 to 9.0 mg/kg every three weeks. Data 
from 433 patients were used in a population pharmacokinetic analysis of free aflibercept 
concentrations (POH0253). In this analysis, the influence of demographic factors (age, gender weight, 
race such as Caucasian, Black and Asian), laboratory determinations (albumin, serum alkaline 
phosphatase, total bilirubin, aspartate amino transferase, alanine amino transferase, total protein and 
creatinine clearance) and concomitantly used chemotherapy agent on the pharmacokinetics of free 
aflibercept was investigated. Later on, a population pharmacokinetic analysis was performed in 416 
patients with both free and bound aflibercept concentrations (POH0263) using the structural model 
that was developed in POH0251. The pharmacokinetics of free (including covariates assessment) and 
bound aflibercept was further investigated with the successive addition of 204 patients from 
EFC10547/VANILLA study (POH0262), 370 patients from EFC10261/VITAL study (POH0274) and 500 
patients from EFC10262/VELOUR study (POH0265 & POH0265- Amendment01). 
Absorption 
Aflibercept is to be administered by intravenous infusion; therefore no relevant studies were 
submitted. A single formulation of aflibercept was used during preclinical and clinical development and 
the same formulation will be used for marketing purposes. 
Distribution 
Aflibercept is distributed via target-mediated drug disposition (TMDD), as it is bound with high affinity 
to its pharmacologic target such that the interaction is reflected in the pharmacokinetic properties of 
the drug.  
According to the population PK model, free aflibercept volume of distribution (Vss) was 7.8, slightly 
greater than blood compartment (POH0265), at doses greater than 2 mg/kg. PK parameters for free 
aflibercept, as determined in the POH0265 final population PK analysis, are presented in the following 
Table 11. 
Zaltrap 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 32/91 
 
 
 
Table 11: PK parameters for free aflibercept in a typical patient, from the POH0265 final 
population PK model 
In the same analysis (POH0265), the final structural model, shown in Figure XXX below, involved two 
compartments for free aflibercept and one for bound aflibercept, with a Michaelis-Menten type binding 
of free aflibercept to VEGF from the peripheral compartment. Free aflibercept in plasma distributes to 
tissues then binds to VEGF to form the complex. The bound aflibercept is assumed to be directly 
eliminated through internalization and not to any appreciable extent through reversible dissociation to 
re-generate free aflibercept and free VEGF. Typical clearance and central volume of distribution for a 
male subject were 0.04 L/h (1.0 L/day) and 4.5 L, respectively. The terminal half-life was 140 hours 
(about 6 days). 
Figure 2: Structural model for free and bound aflibercept  
The Applicant hypothesised that maintaining a free/bound aflibercept ratio above 1 throughout the 
dosing interval would maximise binding of available endogenous VEGF. This ratio, measured in all 
studies, showed that free was consistently in excess of bound aflibercept throughout the treatment 
period at dose levels greater than 2 mg/kg every 2 weeks or greater than 4 mg/kg every three weeks 
(data not shown). 
Elimination 
According to the population PK model, free aflibercept clearance is around 1.0 L/day with a terminal 
half-life of around 6 days, at doses greater than 2 mg/kg. Elimination of VEGF-bound aflibercept is 
slower with an apparent clearance of 0.182 L/day and a half-life of 15 days. At dose levels of 2 mg/kg 
and above, plasma clearance values were in the same order of magnitude across studies. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
The dose proportionality of aflibercept administered as single agent has been evaluated between 0.3 to 
7 mg/kg in study TED6115/TED6116 (single agent) and between 2 and 9 mg/kg in combination with 
Zaltrap 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 33/91 
 
 
 
 
 
docetaxel in study TCD6120 and POH0253. Since docetaxel probably does not impact the 
pharmacokinetics of aflibercept, dose proportionality of free aflibercept was evaluated up to 9 mg/kg. 
Aflibercept exhibits a non linear PK with higher clearance at lowest dose levels. Then, pharmacokinetics 
of free aflibercept is linear over the 2-9 mg/kg dose range. In cancer patients, mean free aflibercept 
clearance decreased from 1.95 L/day at the dose of 0.3 mg/kg to 1.13 L/day at the dose of 2 mg/kg 
and then, remained stable over the 2-9 mg/kg range. Consistently, terminal half-life increased over 
the 0.3-2 mg/kg range and then was stable. This could be related to saturable high-affinity binding of 
aflibercept to endogenous VEGF at higher doses, limited by VEGF availability. 
Based on population PK analysis (POH0265), at 4 mg/kg every 2 weeks and 6 mg/kg every 3 weeks, 
the accumulation ratio for free aflibercept (AUCss/AUC0-336 and AUCss/AUC0-504, respectively) was 
1.2 and 1.1, respectively. After 4 mg/kg every 2 weeks, time to steady state estimated was 10 weeks, 
steady state is as good as reached at the 4th dose (by 6 weeks), and 81% of Ctrough,ss reached at the 
end of the first dose. 
Special populations 
No specific studies to assess the effect of gender, race, weight, age, renal or hepatic function were 
submitted. These effects were evaluated from the population PK analysis. 
Among the 1507 patients included in the population PK analysis (POH0265 and POH0265 - Amendment 
01), 549 (36%) patients were identified with mild renal impairment (50 ml/min ≤CLCR ≤80 ml/min), 
96 (6%) patients with moderate renal impairment (30 ml/min ≤CLCR <50 ml/min), and 5 (<1%) 
patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR <30 ml/min). Clearance decreased by 6.48% for a CLCR 
of 47.8 ml/min and increases by 10.2% for a CLCR of 148 ml/min (compared to a CLCR of 75.9). Mean 
free aflibercept clearance (based on individual post hoc estimates) was 0.65 l/day in patients with 
severe renal impairment (n=5), 0.80 l/day in moderately impaired patients (n=96), and 0.91 l/day in 
the mildly impaired patients (n=549) compared to 1.1 l/day in normal patients (n=857). 
Among the 1507 patients included in the population PK analysis (POH0265 and POH0265 - Amendment 
01), 63 were classified with mild hepatic impairment and 5 with moderate hepatic impairment. Patients 
with low serum albumin concentrations (≤0.568×upper limit of normal [ULN]) or high concentration of 
alkaline phosphatase (≥3.24×ULN) had a 18.7% and 12.9% increase in clearance respectively 
compared with a typical patient. No effect of total bilirubin, aspartate amino transferase and alanine 
amino transferase was identified. 
Gender was the most significant covariate for explaining the inter-individual variability of free 
aflibercept with a 15.5% higher clearance and a 20.6% higher volume of distribution in males than in 
females. However, no difference in AUC was noted between males and females.  
No effect of race was identified in the population analysis, where 92% of the included patients were 
Caucasians. 
Weight has a minor effect on aflibercept clearance with an 8.47% increase in clearance for extreme 
body weight (≥ 99.8 kg) and a higher effect on volume of 16.9%. The effect of weight on free 
aflibercept clearance and volume of distribution, combined with the weight-based dosing, resulted in a 
higher exposure in patients with higher body weight. Area under the curve (AUC) was 29% higher in 
the > 100 kg patient category compared to the 50-100 kg category.  
No effect of age was identified in the population analysis, where 31% of the patients were 65-75 years 
old and 5% of the patients were 75 years or older.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No specific drug-drug interaction studies with aflibercept were submitted. However, PK data from five 
combination Phase I studies were used to assess PK interactions between aflibercept and various other 
anti-cancer agents based on inter-study comparisons. In addition, the effect of combinations on the PK 
of aflibercept was also investigated via population PK analysis (data not shown, see discussion on 
clinical pharmacology). 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Human tissue cross-reactivity studies are described under non-clinical aspects. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
No studies addressing the mechanism of action were submitted. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
In the phase I study TED6115 the aflibercept dose of 4 mg/kg administered every 2 weeks as a 1-hour 
IV infusion was established as the recommended dose for further studies based on dose limiting 
toxicities observation (rectal ulcer and proteinuria observed at 7 mg/kg), analysis of the overall safety 
profile and free/bound level results. The mean trough free/bound aflibercept ratio was greater than 1 
at dose levels greater than 2 mg/kg. The dose of 4 mg/kg every 2 weeks was further confirmed when 
aflibercept was administered in combination with standard doses of the irinotecan and 5-
fluorouracil/leuvovorin regimen in the TCD 6118 Phase 1 study in patients with solid tumours. This 
phase 1 study included a dose escalation and an extension phase, which allowed confirmation of the 
aflibercept dose as well as assessment of the safety profile and preliminary anti-tumour activity of the 
combination at the aflibercept recommended dose of 4 mg/kg every 2 weeks. The trough free/bound 
aflibercept ratio exceeded 1 throughout the dosing interval for most of the patients treated at 4 mg/kg. 
In addition, this study showed promising antitumour activity in heavily pre-treated MCRC patients.  
Studies TED6115 and TCD6118 are described in more detail under dose-response studies. 
The potential aflibercept liability for QT prolongation was assessed in study TES10897. This was a 
prospective, multicentre, international, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group 
study to assess the effect on QTcF interval (QTc Fridericia) of aflibercept versus placebo in cancer 
patients. Aflibercept was administered at 6 mg/kg q3w in combination with docetaxel (every 3 weeks 
dose <75mg/m2). 88 patients were randomised, of whom 87 were treated and evaluated for PK, while 
84 patients were evaluated for PD. Free aflibercept and VEGF-bound aflibercept plasma concentrations 
and Cmax were measured. The PK samples for aflibercept were collected predose, at Cycle 1 and Cycle 
3 (different time points), and at the final Day 60 follow-up visit. ECG intervals (QTcF, QTcB, QTcN, HR, 
PR, QRS) were measured and the exposure-QT relationship (between baseline adjusted QTcF changes 
and log free aflibercept concentration plasma) was assessed. 
In TES10897, after infusion of 6 mg/Kg of aflibercept, the upper bound of the two sided 90% CI for the 
baseline-adjusted QTcF change was below 20 msec at both cycle 1 and cycle 3. The QT-exposure and 
relationship with free aflibercept were calculated at Cycle 1 and Cycle 3. At Cycle 1, the estimated 
slope of the relationship (95%CI) was - 0.013 (-0.044;0.019) versus + 0.048 (0.013;0.082) at Cycle 3 
showing a PK/PD relationship between QTcF change from baseline and free aflibercept concentrations; 
every increase in 100 μg/mL of free aflibercept being associated with null or small (5 msec) increase in

QTcF. In the safety population, analysis showed no QTcF >500 ms but one transient QTcF change from 
baseline ≥ 60 ms (in a patient with a past medical history of myocardial infarction). 
The effect of aflibercept on 24-hour ambulatory systolic and diastolic blood pressures (SBP/DBP) and 
allied physical and laboratory tests was evaluated in 2 single administration Phase 1 healthy male 
subjects studies (PDY6655,  PDY6656). Aflibercept significantly increased 24-hour mean SBP, with 
noticeably greater effects at 4 mg/kg when compared to 1 and 2 mg/kg. The increase in 24-hour mean 
SBP observed in subjects receiving aflibercept 4 mg/kg reached a peak of +14.54 mm Hg (placebo-
corrected mean difference) at week 2, and remained elevated, at +5.47 mmHg 6 weeks after the 
administration. DBP and night time blood pressure were also affected but not pulse pressure.  
Analysis of endothelium dysfunction markers suggested no major alteration of endothelium by 
aflibercept. In single dose Phase 1 studies, aflibercept did not induce proteinuria or microalbuminuria 
and did not modify electrolyte excretion or ClCr. Plasma active renin and aldosterone were decreased 
in aflibercept-treated subjects. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
In the pivotal VELOUR study (EFC10262), overall survival was significantly correlated with free 
aflibercept clearance (p=0.0147), as well as Cmax (p=0.0005), AUC extrapolated (p<0.0001), AUC at 
first cycle (p<0.0001) and average AUCcumOS (cumulative AUC up to last administration + 90 days + 
date of death or cutoff date whichever comes first) (p<0.0001). A significant relationship was also 
shown with bound aflibercept clearance (p<0.0001). For average AUCcumOS, an increase of 1000 
μg.h/mL was associated with a 13% increase in the survival hazard rate. 
Similar results to those observed with OS were observed for PFS: decreased free aflibercept clearance 
(p<0.0001), increased AUC extrapolated (p<0.0001), increased average AUCcumPFS (cumulative AUC 
up to last administration + 90 days or date of progression or cutoff date whichever comes first) 
(p=0.0001) and AUC of first cycle (p<0.0001) were significantly correlated with a higher PFS. Bound 
aflibercept clearance was also correlated with a higher PFS (p=0.0048). For OS and PFS, the results of 
multivariate analyses were consistent with those of the univariate analyses. When adding endogenous 
VEGF at baseline in the multivariate model (356 patients) the relationship between PK parameters and 
efficacy endpoints also remained significant, with a hazard ratio estimate in the same range as without 
VEGF in the model. 
With regard to safety and in the VELOUR study, the occurrence of any hypertension during cycles 1 
and 2 was significantly correlated with free aflibercept Cmax, AUC of first cycle, AUC extrapolated and 
cumulative AUC at cycles 1 and 2. The occurrence of haemorrhage at cycles 1 and 2 was significantly 
correlated with free aflibercept AUC extrapolated and cumulative AUC at cycles 1 and 2 (respective p-
values: 0.0577 and 0351). For proteinuria, a significant relationship was found with only one PK 
parameter: AUCcum at cycles 1 and 2, but with an opposite trend to the one observed for 
hypertension: an increase of 2000 μg.h/mL corresponded to a 51% decrease (p=0.0006 in the 
univariate analysis) in the odds of experiencing proteinuria.  
In the VANILLA study (metastatic pancreatic cancer), the occurrence of hypertension during cycles 1 
and 2 was found to be significantly associated with a decrease in free aflibercept clearance. In the 
VITAL study (advanced NSCLC), for the occurrence of hypertension during cycles 1 and 2, a significant 
relationship was shown with free aflibercept Cmax, AUC of first cycle and clearance. Increased free 
aflibercept Cmax was the only PK parameter significantly associated with the occurrence of any 
proteinuria grade ≥ 2 during cycles 1 and 2. A trend was observed towards higher incidence of venous 
thromboembolic event for lower free aflibercept clearance.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The analytical assays used to measure free and VEGF-bound aflibercept were considered adequately 
validated. 
Being a high molecular weight protein, aflibercept is expected to be eliminated to a large extent in a 
predictable manner and no specific studies have been performed to evaluate the aflibercept 
metabolism, excretion, as well as drug-drug interactions. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
The pharmacokinetic properties of aflibercept and the effect of impaired organ functions, gender, race, 
weight or age on aflibercept pharmacokinetics have to a large extent been derived from a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis with data from 1507 patients with various types of advanced malignancies.  
In preclinical tumour models, biologically active doses of aflibercept correlated with those necessary to 
produce circulating concentrations of free aflibercept in excess of VEGF bound aflibercept. Circulating 
concentrations of VEGF bound aflibercept increase with the aflibercept dose until most available VEGF 
is bound. Further increases in the aflibercept dose resulted in dose-related increases in circulating free 
aflibercept concentrations but only small further increases in the VEGF bound aflibercept concentration.   
In patients, Zaltrap is administered at the dose of 4 mg/kg intravenously every two weeks for which 
there is an excess of circulating free aflibercept compared to VEGF bound aflibercept.   
At the recommended dose regimen of 4 mg/kg every two weeks, concentration of free aflibercept were 
near steady state levels by the second cycle of treatment with essentially no accumulation 
(accumulation ratio of 1.2 at steady-state compared to the first administration). 
The volume of distribution of free aflibercept at steady state is approximately 8 litres.  
No metabolism studies have been conducted with aflibercept since it is a protein. Aflibercept is 
expected to degrade to small peptides and individual amino acids. Free aflibercept is primarily cleared 
by binding to endogenous VEGF to form a stable, inactive complex. As with other large proteins, both 
free and bound aflibercept are expected to be cleared, more slowly, by other biological mechanisms, 
such as proteolytic catabolism. At doses greater than 2 mg/kg, free aflibercept clearance was 
approximately 1.0 L/day with a terminal half life of 6 days. High molecular weight proteins are not 
cleared by the renal route, therefore renal elimination of aflibercept is expected to be minimal.   
Consistent with target mediated drug disposition, free aflibercept exhibits a faster (non linear) 
clearance at doses below 2 mg/kg, likely due to the high affinity binding of aflibercept to endogenous 
VEGF. Linear clearance observed in the dose range of 2 to 9 mg/kg is likely due to non saturable 
biological mechanisms of elimination such as protein catabolism. 
There was no effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of free aflibercept and no effect of race was 
identified in the population analysis, but these observations are based on a small number of patients. 
(see also discussion on clinical safety). 
Weight had an effect on free aflibercept clearance and volume of distribution resulting in a 29% 
increase in aflibercept exposure in patients weighing ≥100 kg. This variability was not considered 
clinically relevant. 
There have been no formal studies with Zaltrap in patients with hepatic impairment. In a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis with data from 1507 patients with various types of advanced malignancies 
receiving Zaltrap with or without chemotherapy, 63 patients with mild hepatic impairment (total 
bilirubin >1.0 x – 1.5 x ULN and any AST) and 5 patients with moderate hepatic impairment (total 
bilirubin >1.5 x – 3 x ULN and any AST) were treated with Zaltrap. In these mild and moderate hepatic 
impairment patients, there was no effect on clearance of aflibercept. There are no data available for 
Zaltrap 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 37/91 
 
 
 
patients with severe hepatic impairment (total bilirubin >3 x ULN and any AST). This information is 
included in section 5.2 of the SmPC (see also discussion on clinical safety). 
There have been no formal studies with Zaltrap in patients with renal impairment. A population 
pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted with data from 1507 patients with various types of advanced 
malignancies receiving Zaltrap with or without chemotherapy. This population included; 549 patients 
with mild renal impairment (CLCR between 50 80 ml/min), 96 patients with moderate renal 
impairment (CLCR between 30 50 ml/min), and 5 patients with severe renal impairment (CLCR <30 
ml/min). This population pharmacokinetic analysis revealed no clinically meaningful differences in 
clearance or systemic exposure (AUC) of free aflibercept in patients with moderate and mild renal 
impairment at the 4 mg/kg dose of Zaltrap as compared to the overall population studied. No 
conclusion can be drawn for patients with severe renal impairment due to very limited data available. 
In the few patients with severe renal impairment, drug exposure was similar to that observed in 
patients with normal renal function. This information is included in section 5.2 of the SmPC (see also 
discussion on clinical safety). 
Safety in terms of hypertension and venous thrombo-embolic event as wells as efficacy in terms of 
overall and progression free survival were significantly positively correlated with exposure to free 
aflibercept. A significant impact of the exposure level of free aflibercept on treatment outcome in terms 
of OS and PFS is shown with a decrease of the hazard rate by 70.1 % and 66.1 % respectively 
comparing 5th and 95th percentiles of exposure. This information is included in section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
No pharmacokinetic interaction studies were submitted. Population pharmacokinetics analysis and inter 
study comparisons did not reveal any pharmacokinetic drug drug interaction between aflibercept and 
the FOLFIRI regimen. This is described in section 4.5 of the SmPC. Considering that aflibercept is a 
protein and eliminated via protein catabolism, clinically relevant interactions are not expected, and the 
lack of proper drug-drug interaction studies is acceptable. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of aflibercept in healthy volunteers and patients with metastatic colorectal 
cancer is considered to be sufficiently characterised. A relationship between free aflibercept exposure 
and treatment outcome (OS and PFS) as well as AEs (hypertension and venous thrombo-embolic 
events) was established.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of aflibercept in its proposed indication is based on a single pivotal phase 3 trial 
(EFC10262- VELOUR) of aflibercept versus placebo in MCRC patients being treated with FOLFIRI after 
failure of an oxaliplatin based regimen. No formal phase II studies, preceding in development the 
pivotal trial, were submitted. 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
A series of dose finding phase I studies of aflibercept single agent (TED6115 and its extension part 
TED6116 study) and combined with various standard chemotherapy regimens (TCD6117, TCD6118, 
TCD6119, TCD6120, TCD6121, TCD10173), including irinotecan plus LV5FU2 (Douillard regimen, 
TCD6118), were submitted.

TED6115: An open-label, sequential-cohort, dose-escalation, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetic 
study of VEGF Trap (aflibercept) administered intravenously in patients with advanced solid tumours or 
lymphoma 
Evaluated for safety: 47 patients in the IV treatment group. 
IV administration: at the following order of dose levels: 0.3, 1.0, 2.0, 4.0, 3.0, 5.0, and 7.0 mg/kg. 
Duration of treatment: 1 dose on Day 1 and 1 dose on Day 15 (2 treatment cycles). 
Safety results  
A total of 47 patients were treated with IV aflibercept ranging from 0.3 to 7.0 mg/kg per a 2-week 
interval schedule. Aflibercept overall was well tolerated up to 7.0 mg/kg IV. Proteinuria and 
hypertension are TEAEs of particular interest, as they are known to be a common effect of this class of 
drugs, ie VEGF blockade. Both of these TEAEs increased in frequency and severity at the 4.0 mg/kg IV 
dose level and above. Across all IV dose levels, the overall frequency of hypertension was reported in 
18 (38.3%) patients and proteinuria in 5 (10.6%) patients. 
A total of 6 dose limiting toxicities were reported in 5 IV patients: 
1.0 mg/kg (N = 7): 1 Grade 3 arthralgia and 1 Grade 3 dysphonia (in the same patient) 
2.0 mg/kg (N = 6): 1 Grade 3 dyspnea 
4.0 mg/kg (N = 7): 1 Grade 3 hypertension 
7.0 mg/kg (N = 13): 1 Grade 2 rectal ulcer and 1 Grade 3 proteinuria 
The MTD of IV aflibercept was not formally determined after dosing at the 7.0 mg/kg level. 
TCD6118: A Phase 1, dose-escalation, sequential-cohort study of the safety, tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetics of intravenous AVE0005A (VEGF Trap) in combination with intravenous irinotecan/5-
fluorouracil/leucovorin administered every 2 weeks in patients with advanced solid malignancies. 
Number of patients: Study Part 1: Enrolled: 48 Treated: 38. Study Part 2: Randomised: 28 Treated: 
27. Total treated: 65 
Aflibercept dose: 2.0 mg/kg during the initial dosing and escalated to either 3.0 or 4.0 mg/kg, then 
escalated by 1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg increments until the RPTD was determined. In Part 2 aflibercept was 
administered at the defined RPTD dose. 
Combination therapy: Patients were given aflibercept followed by LV5FU2-CPT11 every 2 weeks in the 
absence of study withdrawal criteria. 
Safety results 
Part 1: Overall, 38 patients received 585 cycles of aflibercept across the 4 doses levels: 2, 4, 5 and 6 
mg/kg. Out of these, 60.5% had primary colorectal localisation.  
There were 2 patients who experienced a DLT (stomatitis, esophagitis) at the 5 mg/kg dose level and 1 
patient with 1 DLT (febrile neutropenia) reported at the 6 mg/kg dose level. 
Part 2: The 4 mg/kg aflibercept dose was selected for Part 2 of the study. Overall, 27 patients 
were treated whereof 70.4% with primary colorectal localisation. 
All 27 patients experienced at least 1 TEAE while on study treatment. The most frequent clinical TEAEs 
were asthenia/fatigue, diarrhoea, dysphonia, nausea, anorexia, alopecia, hypertension, stomatitis, 
vomiting, dyspnoea, epistaxis, and dry skin. Grade 3/4 clinical TEAEs reported most commonly were 
hypertension, asthenia/fatigue, dyspnea, and anorexia. Proteinuria was observed in 85% of patients 
Zaltrap 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 39/91 
 
 
 
with 34.6% ≥ Grade 2. Hematuria concomitant with proteinuria was observed in 6 patients (23.1%). 
There was 1 patient with a Grade 3 event of left ventricular dysfunction reported at Cycle 31, and 
another patient with a recto-vaginal fistula. Five patients were taken off study treatment due to AEs. 
One death was caused by drug-related cerebral haemorrhage and 1 by cardiac insufficiency. 
Efficacy results 
Seven patients out of 42 with MCRC showed objective PRs and 27 had an SD as best response 
category (ie, 81% of disease control). 
2.5.2.  Main study 
EFC10262 (VELOUR) 
Methods 
This was a randomised, double-blind study, comparing the efficacy of aflibercept versus placebo in 
patients with metastatic Colorectal Cancer (MCRC) treated with the irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/folinic acid 
combination (FOLFIRI) after failure of an oxaliplatin based regimen. 
The study was conducted in 176 centres in 28 countries; participating sites were from Western and 
Eastern Europe, North and South America, Australia, South Africa and in South Korea. 
Study Participants  
Inclusion criteria  
Patients meeting all of the following criteria were to be considered for enrolment into the study: 
•  Histologically or cytologically proven adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum  
•  Metastatic disease that was not amenable to potentially curative treatment (ie, inoperable)  
•  Measurable or non-measurable disease (as per RECIST).  
•  One and only one prior chemotherapeutic regimen for metastatic disease. This prior chemotherapy 
had to be an oxaliplatin containing regimen. Patients had to have progressed during or following the 
last administration of the oxaliplatin based chemotherapy. Patients who relapsed within 6 month of 
completion of oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy were eligible. 
Key exclusion criteria 
•  Prior therapy with irinotecan.  
•  Less than 28 days elapsed from prior radiotherapy, from prior surgery and prior chemotherapy to 
the time of randomization.  
•  Age <18 years.  
•  ECOG PS >2.  
•  History of brain metastases, uncontrolled spinal cord compression, or carcinomatous meningitis or 
new evidence of brain or leptomeningeal disease.  
•  Presence of anti-VEGF class related events: Proteinuria, uncontrolled hypertension, uncontrolled 
thromboembolic events within 3 months, deep vein thrombosis within 4 weeks, coagulopathy, non-
healing wounds. 
Zaltrap 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 40/91 
 
 
 
•  Conditions contraindicating FOLFIRI treatment: Dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency, 
uncontrolled small bowel or colonic disorders, enteropathy, chronic diarrhoea, bowel obstruction, 
known Gilbert's syndrome. 
• 
Inadequate bone marrow function: ANC <1.5 x 109/L, platelet count <100 x 109/L, hemoglobin 
<9.0 g/dL 
•  Serum creatinine >1.5 x upper limit of normal (ULN). If creatinine 1.0-1.5 x ULN, creatinine 
clearance, calculated according to Cockroft-Gault formula, <60 ml/min excluded the patient. 
• 
Inadequate liver function tests: Total bilirubin >1.5 x ULN, transaminases >3 x ULN (unless liver 
metastasis present, 5 x ULN in that case). Alkaline phosphatase >3 x ULN (unless liver metastasis 
present, 5 x ULN in that case). 
Treatments 
Study treatment administration had to start within 3 days of randomisation. 
•  Arm A, aflibercept: 4 mg/kg administered IV over 1 hour on Day 1, every 2 weeks.  
•  Arm B, placebo: 4 mg/kg administered IV over 1 hour on Day 1, every 2 weeks 
Immediately after aflibercept/placebo administration, all the patients were to receive the 
FOLFIRI regimen, administered as follows:  
• 
Irinotecan 180 mg/m2 IV infusion in 500 mL D5W over 90 minutes and dl leucovorin 400 
mg/m² IV infusion over 2 hours (leucovorin expressed in dl racemic, when the l-isomer form is 
used the dose should be divided by 2, ie, 200 mg/m²), at the same time, in bags using a Y-
line, followed by:  
•  5-FU 400 mg/m² IV bolus given over 2-4 minutes, followed by:  
•  5-FU 2400 mg/m² continuous IV infusion in 500 mL D5W (recommended) over 46-hours. 
In case BSA >2.0 m², the actual doses of irinotecan and 5-FU were to be adjusted to a maximum BSA 
of 2.0 m², for safety reasons. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study was to demonstrate improvement in OS with aflibercept by 
comparison to placebo in patients with colorectal cancer treated with FOLFIRI as second line treatment 
for metastatic disease.  
Secondary objectives included: to compare PFS in the two treatment arms; to evaluate overall RR, as 
per response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST), in the two treatment arms; to evaluate the 
safety profile in the two treatment arms; to assess immunogenicity of intravenous aflibercept; to 
assess pharmacokinetics of IV aflibercept and perform population PK evaluation. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
In terms of efficacy, the primary endpoint was Overall Survival (OS). Progression-free Survival (PFS) 
as assessed by an Independent Review Committee (IRC) was a secondary endpoint and it was to be 
considered as co-primary endpoint, if a statistically significant difference for OS failed to be observed 
(see statistical methods). Since IRC review was not in place at the start of the study, investigator 
assessment was used for patients who died prior to the implementation of Amendment 2 of the study 
protocol (see Conduct of the study below) and for those patients who did not consent to third party 
Zaltrap 
CHMP assessment report

review. If death or progression was not observed, the patient was censored at the date of last valid 
tumour assessment without evidence of progression or at the study cut-off date, whichever came first, 
regardless of initiation of further anti-tumour therapies.  
Response Rate (RR) based on IRC assessment was to be testedonly if OS or PFS tested positive. 
Sample size 
For the primary endpoint of OS, the expected median survival time in the control arm (FOLFIRI + 
placebo) was 11 months. A 20% risk reduction in aflibercept + FOLFIRI arm compared to FOLFIRI + 
placebo arm was expected (HR of 0.80, corresponding to a median OS improvement from 11 months 
in the control arm to 13.75 months in the test arm). Assuming that survival times would be 
exponentially distributed in both treatment arms, a total of 863 deaths was required to detect with 
90% power a 20% risk reduction in the aflibercept arm relative to the placebo arm, using a two sided 
log-rank test at a significance level of 0.0499. 
Based on an anticipated accrual period of 30 months followed by 9 months of follow-up after the 
randomisation of the last patient, a total of 1200 patients (600 in each arm) were required to achieve 
the targeted number of events. 
Randomisation 
Eligible patients were randomly assigned to either the control arm or the experimental arm in a 1:1 
ratio. Randomisation was stratified according to baseline Eastern cooperative oncology group 
performance status ([ECOG PS] 0 versus 1 versus 2) and prior bevacizumab (yes versus no). Patients 
who, at the time of randomisation, were on the follow-up phase of a double-blind controlled study with 
bevacizumab (either bevacizumab versus placebo or bevacizumab versus another biologic agent) while 
that study was still blinded, could still be randomised in the present study. In such cases, stratification 
for prior bevacizumab was to be ‘yes’. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. 
Statistical methods 
As per initial protocol, one formal interim analysis was planned when 561 death events (65% 
information fraction) had occurred, using a two-sided nominal significance level of 0.0107 based on an 
O’Brien-Fleming alpha spending function. An early stopping of the study for efficacy was to be 
considered if the O’Brien Fleming efficacy boundary was met. The final PFS analysis was performed at 
the time of that interim OS analysis. 
Upon request of the Data Monitoring Committee (DMC), an additional interim analysis of OS was 
performed to provide an early evaluation of the benefit-risk ratio, when 315 death events (36.5% 
information fraction) had occurred. A futility boundary was planned for that analysis, and in order to 
maintain the integrity of the trial (penalty for type-I error), a stopping boundary for possible 
overwhelming efficacy was also planned using the O’Brien-Fleming alpha spending function. The two-
sided nominal significance level for efficacy at this interim analysis was 0.00042. 
If the O'Brien-Fleming boundary was crossed by OS at the second interim (ie, p-value of OS was 
<0.0107), the study could be stopped; otherwise, the PFS would be used as a co-primary endpoint 
while the study would continue for OS. In that context, the alpha level was split between OS and PFS 
to adequately control the overall type I error rate. PFS was tested at a 2-sided 0.0001 level and the 
Zaltrap 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 42/91 
 
 
 
overall alpha level for OS was at a 2-sided 0.0499 level. Response rate was to be tested only after 
either OS or PFS was tested positive. 
Using a group sequential approach with an O’Brien Fleming Alpha-spending function and an overall 
two-sided α level of 0.0499, the two-sided nominal significance level to be used at the final analysis of 
OS was 0.0466.

Recruitment 
The first patient was enrolled in the study on 19 November 2007 and the last patient was enrolled on 
16 March 2010. The date for the data cut-off was 7 February 2011, upon occurrence of the 863rd 
patient’s dearth on study and final planned OS data analysis.  
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was subject to 5 amendments whereof the first was dated before start of 
enrolment. In the first amendment, in order to balance the number of patients with ECOG performance 
status equal to 0, 1 and 2, across treatment arms, stratification at randomisation for PS was changed

from 0-1 versus 2 to 0 versus 1 versus 2. Moreover, response rate (RR) was added as secondary 
efficacy endpoint. With the 2nd amendment, patients that were on the follow up phase of double blind 
trials with bevacizumab in first line metastatic colorectal cancer were allowed to participate in the 
study while the previous study was still blinded. An independent imaging third party review was set up. 
In the 3rd amendment, a supplemental analysis for an early evaluation of the benefit to risk ratio 
requested by the DMC was introduced, including an analysis of OS and a descriptive analysis of the 
secondary endpoint, PFS, as assessed by the investigators, to be performed when 315 death events 
had occurred. Furthermore, a change in the protocol was implemented, in which the disease 
progression event in the primary analysis of PFS was to be based on assessment of radiological tumour 
progression by the IRC. With amendment 4, use of G-CSF as necessary was recommended following 
DMC review of unblinded data and with amendment 5 the duration of study participation was extended 
for approximately 9 months beyond the cut-off data for the primary OS analysis. 
Overall, 16 patients had one important selection criteria deviation: 10 patients (1.6%) in the placebo 
arm and 6 patients (1.0%) in the aflibercept arm. These patients were not excluded from the ITT 
population or the evaluable population (EP). The most common reason was relapse more than 6 
months after completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, 5 patients in the placebo arm and 2 patients in 
the aflibercept arm. 
Seven patients received the wrong study medication: Four patients who were randomised to the 
placebo arm received at least one infusion of aflibercept and were therefore included in the aflibercept 
arm for the analysis of safety, and three patients who were randomised to the aflibercept arm received 
at least one infusion of placebo without impact on their treatment group for safety analysis.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Data from a single placebo-controlled phase III pivotal study, EFC10262 or VELOUR, are presented. In 
2007, when the pivotal study was being designed, the utility of the anti-VEGF agent, bevacizumab, had 
already been demonstrated in first-line therapy, with significant prolongation of survival observed 
when bevacizumab was added to irinotecan-based treatment (IFL). In patients with previously treated 
MCRC, a survival benefit of bevacizumab had been demonstrated with oxaliplatin-based treatment 
(FOLFOX). However, at that time, no large, randomised, controlled study had demonstrated a survival 
benefit with the use of an antiangiogenic agent, or with other targeted agents in combination with an 
irinotecan-based regimen, which had evolved to be the backbone chemotherapy for the second-line 
setting. 
The rationale for choice of dose and concomitant therapies is accepted. The results are considered 
valid for the EU. No protocol amendments or violations are identified that would substantially impact 
Zaltrap 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 55/91 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
on the efficacy analyses and conclusions. Thus, no major concerns regarding the conduct of the study 
are noted. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
For the primary efficacy endpoint, OS, the analysis was based on reasonably mature data and 
performed after a median follow-up time of 22.3 months. A statistically significant difference was 
observed between treatment groups in terms of the primary efficacy endpoint OS. The difference in 
median OS was 1.44 months in favour of the aflibercept arm. The sensitivity analyses exploring the 
effect in relevant subgroups were in support of the primary analysis. 
No baseline patient or disease characteristics significantly predictive of response to the addition of 
aflibercept to FOLFIRI have been identified so far. A numerically less beneficial effect on OS within the 
aflibercept arm was seen for patients previously treated with bevacizumab. However, no significant 
treatment interaction at the 10% level was noted in the subgroup analyses. Moreover, the study was 
not powered to demonstrate superiority of aflibercept over placebo in any particular subgroup so that 
any apparent lower OS benefit, e.g. for patients who received prior bevacizumab, could be due to 
random variation. Relevant information has been included in section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
PFS according to independent review was a secondary endpoint, performed at the second interim 
analysis. Median PFS was 2.23 months significantly longer in the aflibercept arm than in the placebo 
arm, HR 0.758. The sensitivity analyses performed are considered to be in support of the primary 
analysis, although the difference between study arms was not formally statistically significant 
(p=0.0017) in the investigators’ assessment-based analysis. 
Subgroup analyses for overall survival and progression free survival according to ECOG PS, age (<65; 
≥65), gender, presence of liver metastasis only (data not shown), history of prior hypertension and 
number of organs involved (data not shown), showed a treatment effect favouring the Zaltrap/FOLFIRI 
regimen over the placebo/FOLFIRI regimen. 
Overall objective response rate, performed in the evaluable population, was a secondary endpoint and 
showed a significantly better response rate in the aflibercept arm, 19.8% vs 11.1% in the placebo arm, 
stratified p=0.0001. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The application is supported by a well-conducted controlled study. Superiority of aflibercept combined 
with FOLFIRI over placebo combined with FOLFIRI in terms of OS was shown convincingly although the 
effect was small. The outcome of the primary efficacy analysis is supported by the outcome of the 
secondary endpoints PFS and OR. The external validity of the study is not questioned.  
No validated predictive serum or plasma biomarkers have been identified that correlate with treatment 
outcomes to aflibercept. The Applicant is planning to retrospectively analyse plasma and tissue 
samples from the EFC10262, EFC10668 and EFC11338 trials, with the primary aim to determine 
prognostic or predictive biomarkers correlating with OS. This information is considered key to the 
benefit-risk balance of the product, as it promises to help better define the target population.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The core safety data in support of the safety of aflibercept in the proposed indication were derived 
from the pivotal ECF10262/VELOUR study in MCRC patients. 
Eleven additional studies in which aflibercept was administered as single agent (6 Phase 1 or Phase 2 
studies) and in combination with other agents (5 combination Phase I studies) have been taken into 
account for the safety analysis, as well as data coming from two further completed Phase 3 studies 
(VANILLA/ VITAL). 
All together safety data from the three Phase 3 studies, single-agent Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies, and 
combination Phase 1 study have been reported in a integrate safety database (ISD) with a cut-off date 
of 07 February 2011. Overall, 2073 patients were exposed to aflibercept. 
Furthermore, in order to explore the relative risk of specific adverse events, a meta-analysis was 
performed on the 3 Phase 3 studies (ECF 10262/VELOUR, EFC10547/VANILLA and EFC10261/VITAL). 
Results from a Phase 1 QT interval prolongation study (TES10897), not included in the integrate safety 
database, have been also reported together with a summary of SAEs from ongoing trials sponsored by 
the Applicant and NCI.  
The source of safety data are summarised in the following Table 25.

(4) Not reported in MCRC study; however, PRES was reported in patients from other studies treated 
with aflibercept as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapies other than FOLFIRI 
The most frequently reported TEAEs were gastrointestinal disorders (placebo arm: 86.1%; aflibercept 
arm: 93.5%) and general disorders and administration site conditions (placebo arm: 62.6%; 
aflibercept arm: 71.5%).  
The most frequently reported gastrointestinal disorders (all grades, placebo arm versus aflibercept 
arm) were diarrhoea (56.5% versus 69.2%), nausea (54.0% versus 53.4%), stomatitis and ulceration 
(HLT, 34.9% versus 54.8%) and vomiting (33.4% versus 32.9%).  
Among general disorders, the most frequently reported TEAEs (all grades, placebo arm versus 
aflibercept arm) were asthenic conditions (HLT, 50.2% versus 60.4%). 
Events with an excess in incidence (all grades) in the aflibercept arm of more than 10% over the 
placebo arm were: hypertension (41.4% vs 10.7%), dysphonia (25.4% vs 3.3%), proteinuria (62.2% 
vs 40.7%), epistaxis (27.7% vs 7.4%), stomatitis and ulceration (54.8 vs 34.9%), weight decrease 
(31.9% vs 14.4%), thrombocytopenia (47.4% vs 33.8%), headache (22.3% vs 8.8%), infections and 
infestations (46.2% vs 32.7%), diarrhoea (69.2% vs 56.5%), neutropenia (67.8% vs 56.3%), asthenic 
conditions (60.4% vs 50.2%), ALT increase (47.3% vs 37.1%).

Grade 3 or 4 events were reported in 378 patients (62.5%) in the placebo arm and 510 patients 
(83.5%) in the aflibercept arm. A frequency ≥2% higher in the aflibercept arm in the incidence of 
grade 3 or 4 events was reported for hypertension (1.5% of patients in the placebo arm versus 19.1% 
of patients in the aflibercept arm), diarrhoea (7.8% versus 19.3%), stomatitis and ulceration (HLT; 
5.0% versus 13.7%), asthenic conditions (HLT; 10.6% versus 16.9%), GI and abdominal pains (HLT; 
3.3% versus 5.4%), dehydration (1.3% versus 4.3%), and palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia 
syndrome (0.5% versus 2.8%). 
The addition of aflibercept to FOLFIRI resulted in increased frequency of certain adverse events that 
are characteristic of irinotecan and 5-FU administration. The frequencies of all grades and of grade 3-4 
of both diarrhoea and neutropenia were increased in the aflibercept arm compared to the placebo arm. 
Similarly, the characteristic 5-FU toxicities of stomatitis and PPE syndrome both occurred more 
frequently under aflibercept treatment compared to placebo (all grades and grade 3 or 4). 
Potential anti-VEGF class events were analysed according to groups of TEAE terms, with clusters based 
upon the safety profile of aflibercept as observed in Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies as well as upon the 
known risks associated with other agents targeting the VEGF pathway. These specific group terms 
included: hypertension, haemorrhage, cardiac dysfunction, arterial and venous thromboembolic 
events, fistula, gastrointestinal perforation, compromised wound healing, osteonecrosis, reversible 
posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS), thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), haemolytic 
uremic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).  
A summary of grouped events (all grades and grade≥3) in VELOUR by risk ratio is provided in Tables 
30 and 31 below. Additionally, to asses the relative risk associated with aflibercept versus placebo, a 
meta-analysis of the 3 phase 3 studies completed was performed to explore the impact of the following 
selected events of interest.

Hypertension: In EFC10262, the number of patients with all grade hypertension was greater in the 
aflibercept arm (41.4%) than in the placebo arm (10.7%). In particular, the proportion of patients with 
grade 3 hypertension (requiring more than one drug or more intensive anti hypertensive therapy than 
previously) was higher in the aflibercept arm than in the placebo arm (19.1% versus 1.5%). One 
patient in the aflibercept arm developed a grade 4 event with no end-organ damaged reported.  
In both treatment arms, more than half of the patients who experienced hypertension had the first 
occurrence during the first two cycles of treatment with a median time to onset similar between both 
groups. 
Meta-analysis: The summary incidence of all grade hypertension in patients treated with aflibercept 
was 33.5% versus 7.9% in placebo-treated patients.For hypertension, treatment effects were 
consistent across Phase 3 studies (p-value for interaction: 0.32). The risk of occurrence of 
hypertension was consistently higher in the aflibercept arm compared to placebo whatever the 
background chemotherapy . The risk of developing hypertension was multiplied by 4.24-fold in 
aflibercept as compared to placebo (RR = 4.24, 95% CI: 3.48 to 5.18).  
Haemorrhage: In EFC10262, the number of patients with at least one haemorrhagic event (all 
grades) was greater in the aflibercept arm (37.8%) than in the placebo arm (19.0%). The most 
frequently reported TEAE (all grades) in this category was epistaxis, in both the placebo and aflibercept 
arms, reported in 7.4% and 27.7% of patients, respectively. In addition there was more haemorrhage 
(all grades) from gastrointestinal origin in the aflibercept arm compared to placebo (10.0% versus 
5.1%, respectively), and more haemoptysis (all grade 1 or 2 events).  
The timing of first occurrence of haemorrhagic events was comparable between arms, with more than 
half of the patients in each treatment arm first experiencing such events during the first 3 treatment 
cycles. 
One patient in the placebo arm and 12 patients in the aflibercept arm discontinued study treatment 
(premature or permanent discontinuation) due to haemorrhagic events. 
One patient in the aflibercept arm experienced a fatal gastrointestinal haemorrhage consequent to 
duodenal haemorrhage.  
Grade 3 or 4 haemorrhagic events were seen in other studies in solid tumour patients (total of 
43/1462 including 16 fatal events), including cases of intracranial and pulmonary haemorrhage.

Meta-analysis: The summary incidence of all grade haemorrhage in aflibercept treated patients was 
31.6% versus 14.6% among patients treated with placebo (the difference being mostly due to grade 1 
or 2 epistaxis). For haemorrhage, treatment effects were consistent across Phase 3 studies (p-value 
for interaction: 0.41). The risk of developing haemorrhage was multiplied by 2.16-fold in aflibercept as 
compared to placebo (RR = 2.16, 95%CI: 1.86 to 2.52). When considering grade 3 or 4 events, the 
overall incidence was numerically increased with aflibercept compared to placebo (3.1% and 1.5%, 
respectively). 
Cardiac dysfunction: Meta-analysis: The summary incidence of all grade cardiac dysfunction was 
0.2% of placebo treated patients and 0.7% of aflibercept treated patients (0.3% in EFC10262, 1.9% in 
EFC10547, and 0.4% in EFC10261). The risk ratio of aflibercept versus placebo for all grades cardiac 
dysfunction was 2.99 (95% CI: 0.81 to 11.02). 
The incidence reported in single-agent and combination Phase 1 and Phase 2 studies was 2% and 1%, 
respectively. 
Arterial thromboembolic events: In study EFC10262 all grade ATEs were reported in 9 patients 
(1.5%) in the placebo arm and 16 patients (2.6%) in the aflibercept arm. These arterial events were 
mainly from cardiac ischemic origin. Grade 3 or 4 events were reported in 3 patients in the placebo 
arm and 11 patients in the aflibercept arm. No fatal ATEs were reported during the study.  
Of the 16 patients in the aflibercept arm who experienced ATEs, 10 (62.5%) discontinued study 
treatment whilst in the placebo arm, 1 of the 9 patients (11.1%) with ATEs discontinued study 
treatment. 
The incidences of ATEs were similar in single-agent (2.7%) and combination (1.8%) Phase 1 and Phase 
2 studies.  
Meta-analysis: ATEs occurred in 1.7% of placebo treated patients in the 3 Phase 3 studies and 2.3% in 
aflibercept treated patients. The risk ratio of aflibercept over placebo for all grade ATE was 1.36 (95% 
CI: 0.79 to 2.34). 
Venous thromboembolic events: In study EFC10262, all grade VTEs were slightly more common in 
patients in the aflibercept arm (9.3%) than in the placebo arm (7.3%). The incidence of grade 3 or 4 
VTEs was 7.9% in the aflibercept arm and 6.3% in the placebo arm with over half of these grade 3 or 
4 events being pulmonary embolism events (aflibercept: 4.7%, placebo: 3.5%).  
Discontinuation of study treatment due to VTE was reported for 45.6% of patients with VTE in the 
aflibercept arm as compared to 36.4% in the placebo arm.  
One patient in the aflibercept arm experienced a fatal pulmonary embolism.  
Meta-analysis: In study EFC10547, VTE occurred in 11.1% of patients receiving placebo versus 8.9% 
of patients receiving aflibercept.  In EFC10261, VTE occurred in 4.6% of patients in the placebo arm 
versus 3.1% of patients receiving aflibercept. Overall, in the Phase 3 studies, the incidence of all grade 
VTE was 7.1% in both treatment groups (placebo and aflibercept). Aflibercept did not increase the risk 
of VTE compared to placebo (RR = 1.00 [95%CI: 0.76 to 1.31]). 
Fistula: In study EFC10262, 3 patients in the placebo arm and 9 patients in the aflibercept arm had a 
fistula either from GI or non GI origin. In the aflibercept arm, fistula events were observed without 
specific pattern in the timing of occurrence. Most of the primary tumours were rectum or rectosigmoid 
(8 out of 9). Four fistulae occurred in patients who had local abscess or tumour necrosis. No other 
specific risk factors could be identified. Fistula prevented continuation of study treatment in 7 patients. 
No fistula was fatal. 
Zaltrap 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 64/91 
 
 
 
Meta-analysis: Fistulae from GI and non GI origin were pooled for meta-analysis, due the low number 
of reported cases. Amongst the patients treated with aflibercept, the summary incidence of all grade 
fistulae was 1.1% versus 0.2% in the placebo arm. The overall risk of fistula was significantly 
increased with aflibercept, with respect to placebo (OR = 4.57, 95%CI: 1.42 to 20.01). 
Gastrointestinal perforation: In study EFC10262, 3 patients in the placebo arm and 3 patients in 
the aflibercept arm had a GI perforation. In the integrated safety database 19 patients exposed to 
aflibercept (0.9%) had a gastrointestinal perforation (9 ovarian/cervix, 6 NSCL, 3 
rectum/rectosigmoid, and 1 pancreas cancer). In the integrated safety database, 23 patients 
experienced GI perforation, 19 of them were treated with aflibercept (0.9%); there were 3 cases in 
rectum/rectosigmoid cancer patients. All but one were grade 3 or 4 and the events led to study 
treatment discontinuation in 15 patients. Overall, GI perforation events were fatal in 7 patients (3 with 
ovarian cancer, 3 with NSCLC and 1 rectosigmoid) despite corrective or palliative surgery, which was 
performed in 3 of them. Among the 7 fatal cases, 6 were diagnosed at cycle 1 or 2. 
Meta-analysis: In the 3 Phase 3 studies, gastrointestinal perforation occurred in 0.5% of patients in 
each arm in study EFC10262 and at rates of 0.3% and 0.8% for placebo and aflibercept patients, 
respectively. The risk ratio of aflibercept over placebo for all grades GI perforation was 2.49 (95% CI: 
0.78 to 7.93). 
Compromised wound healing: In EFC10262, compromised wound healing was reported in 3 patients 
(0.5%) in the aflibercept arm and 5 patients (0.8%) in the placebo arm. Grade 3 compromised wound 
healing was reported in 2 patients treated with aflibercept (0.3%) and in none of the placebo-treated 
patients. 
In the integrated safety database overall 9 patients (0.4%) had a compromised wound healing. 
Compromised wound healing led to aflibercept treatment discontinuation or cycle delay in 7 patients. 
The events resolved in 7 patients and were still present at the time of death for the 2 other patients. 
None of these events was fatal.  
Meta-analysis: Overall, the incidence of all grade compromised wound healing was 0.5% in the 
aflibercept arm and 0.4% in the placebo arm, RR of aflibercept versus placebo was 1.40 (95%CI: 0.44 
to 4.39). 
Osteonecrosis: Two cases of osteonecrosis were reported in patients receiving aflibercept in 
EFC10262. 
In the integrated safety database, a total of 7 cases of osteonecrosis have been reported, 6 of them in 
aflibercept treated patients (0.3%). No specific pattern was observed in the timing of occurrence. In 3 
cases there was a history of jaw inflammation and in 3 other cases, there was a history of 
biphosphonate use. Treatment was discontinued in 2 out of 6 patients. 
Meta-analysis: The RR of aflibercept over placebo for all grades osteonecrosis was 2.99 (95% CI: 0.31 
to 28.72. 
Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS): No RPLS was reported in study 
EFC10262. 
In the integrated safety database, RPLS occurred in 4 patients treated with aflibercept, was grade 3-4 
in 3 of them, and contributed to death in one of the patients (primary cause of death was disease 
progression) and treatment discontinuation in 2 others. Amongst the 4 RPLS, 2 occurred in patients 
receiving aflibercept as single-agent therapy (2/404, 0.5%).   
Notably, the 0708 study, in which aflibercept was combined with pemetrexed and cisplatin for the 
treatment of advanced carcinoma, was closed due to the occurrence of RPLS in 3 patients out 62 
Zaltrap 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 65/91 
 
 
 
enrolled (4.8%) compared to 8 patients out 2926 (0.27%) in all other trials sponsored by the 
Applicant. 
Overall, there are 17 cases of RPLS reported: 
• Study 0708 3 cases of RPLS in 62 patients (4.8%)  
• Phase 1 to 2 single agent studies with 2 cases in 404 patients (0.5 %);  
• Phase 1 to 2 studies with aflibercept in combination with cytotoxic chemotherapy with 4 cases in 577 
patients (0.7%); and  
• Phase 3 studies (non-squamous NSCLC, pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, and prostate cancer) 
with 2 cases in approximately 2069 patients (~ 0.10%)  
• NCI studies with 6 in 683 patients exposed (0.9%) 
Overall, there were 13 females and 4 males who developed the syndrome. Overall the mean age was 
60.5 years (SD 12.5) with a median age of 59 years (range 34 to 76 years). The mean cycle at 
diagnosis was 4.8 (SD 5.3), mean day from last administration was 10.4 (SD 6.8). Twelve cases were 
reported as having recovered, (for 1 of the 12 cases the outcome was not specifically reported 
however the end date for the event was reported as 3 days following the event onset). The mean 
duration for these 12 events was 13.5 days (SD 11.2). The dosing regimen of 4mg/kg aflibercept 
administered every 2 weeks was background treatment in 11 of the 17 cases. Of these 11 cases, 8 
were with single agent aflibercept and 3 were with aflibercept administered in combination with 
cytotoxic chemotherapy. 
Eight of the patients had a reported past medical history of hypertension. Of the 9 patients with no 
past medical history of hypertension 5 developed increased blood pressure on treatment prior to the 
event. Thus, careful treatment of hypertension might be an important prophylactic measure. 
Thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), hemolytic uremic syndrome, and thrombotic 
thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP): In the integrated safety database, overall 9 patients (0.4%) 
were reported as having TMA including one patient in EFC10262. Most of the cases appeared mild in 
severity, however, 3 biopsy-confirmed TMA were observed with concomitant abnormalities supporting 
the diagnosis. All of these 3 cases led to treatment discontinuation, needed corrective treatment and 
resolved. 
Two patients had a TTP and 1 patient a HUS. Two events led to treatment discontinuation and all 
resolved. 
Acute drug reactions: In EFC10262, acute drug reactions were reported with the same frequency in 
both treatment arms (26 patients = 4.3% in each arm), with 3 patients in each arm (0.5%) reporting 
grade 3 events. Events lasted less than 1 day in both arms. Skin disorders were more common in the 
aflibercept arm. Two patients in each treatment arm discontinued study treatment due to acute drug 
reactions.  
Meta-analysis: Among the patients treated with aflibercept, the summary incidence of all grade acute 
drug reaction was 4.4%, versus 3.5% in patients treated with placebo. The RR of aflibercept over 
placebo for all grades acute drug reactions was 1.26 (95% CI: 0.86 to 1.84). 
Immunological events: Serum samples were evaluated for binding anti-aflibercept antibodies using 
a sandwich or a bridging immunoassay (anti-drug antibody (ADA) assay). Serum samples that were 
positive in this bridging ADA assay were further evaluated for neutralising activity in the neutralising 
antibody (NAb) assay. It is noted that presence of rheumatoid factor could generate a positive 
response in the bridging immunoassay. In all Phase 1 studies, the lower limit of quantitation (LOQ) 
Zaltrap 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 66/91 
 
 
 
was 238.4 ng/mL, while in all Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies, the assay used a non-quantitative titre-
based measurement. 
Overall, among the 1671 patients treated with aflibercept and evaluable for immunogenicity, 
63 patients (3.8%) had a positive response for anti-aflibercept antibodies and 17 patients (1.3%) had 
neutralising anti-aflibercept antibodies.

In the pivotal EFC10262 study 1.5% (8 patients) had a positive response for ADA and 0.2% (1 patient) 
for NAb in the aflibercept arm, and 3.4% (18 patients) had positive response for ADA at least once 
post baseline and 0.4% (2 patients) for NAb in the placebo arm. Among patients with ADA positive, 4 
(50%) and 10 (56%) were positive at baseline in the aflibercept and placebo arms, respectively. The 
patient with NAb positive in aflibercept arm at cycle 3 received 10 cycles of treatment, had stable 
disease as best response and experienced disease progression after 189 days (6.2 months) on study.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
The total number of patients with SAEs was greater in the aflibercept arm (48.1%) than in the placebo 
arm (32.7%). Similarly, the incidence of grade 3-4 SAEs was more common in the aflibercept arm 
(41.6% of patients vs 28.8%). 
At the SOC level, the most frequently reported SAEs were gastrointestinal disorders, with a higher 
incidence seen amongst patients in the aflibercept arm (20.3% versus 11.2%), infection and 
infestations (11.3% vs 6.3%), blood and lymphatic system disorders (6.5% versus 2.5%), metabolism 
and nutrition disorders (4.9% versus 1.8%) and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (5.9% 
versus 3.0%).  
Serious adverse events in the pivotal study are summarised in the following Table 33.

More than 50% of the deaths in context other than disease progression (10/16 aflibercept; and 3/6 
placebo patients) were aged ≥65, while approximately one third of patients in the overall safety 
population were aged ≥65.  
Death occurrence was observed after an average of 6 cycles of study treatment in both arms with an 
average day of occurrence between Day 9 (placebo group) and Day 12 (aflibercept group) of the last 
cycle. In the aflibercept group, 7/16 events and half of the fatal events in the placebo group (3/6 
events) were assessed as related to study treatment. 
Deaths in the context of disease progression and in context other than disease progression are 
presented in the following Tables 35 and 36.

* AEs leading to death within 30 days of last dose of study medication or more than 30 days of last dose and due to 
AE  
The most frequent AEs leading to death within 30 days of last dose (other than disease progression) 
across both treatment groups was infection (4/16 in the aflibercept group and 3/6 in the placebo 
group). Two of the 4 fatal events in the aflibercept arm and 1 of the 3 in the placebo arm occurred in 
the context of neutropenia. The events of rectal abscess in the aflibercept group and the events of 
neutropenic infection and lobar pneumonia in the placebo group were assessed as related to study 
treatment.  
In the aflibercept arm, hypovolaemia and dehydration were contributing factors to fatal events in 4 out 
of 16 deaths. The fatal events were dehydration (2 cases), hypovolemic shock (1 case) and metabolic 
encephalopathy (1 case). Grade 3 or 4 dehydration was observed in all cases, and was a consequence 
of either grade 3 vomiting (1 patient who died from metabolic encephalopathy) or grade 3 or 4 
diarrhoea (3 patients). One of these cases was considered as related to study treatment (hypovolemic 
shock).

Safety analyses by baseline creatinine clearance categories (<50, ≥50-80, >80 mL/min) were 
performed in all evaluable patients from the 3 placebo-controlled studies (n=2067). In patients 
receiving aflibercept, the adverse reactions in patients with mild renal impairment at baseline (n=352) 
were generally comparable with that of patients without renal impairment (n=642). A limited number 
of patients having moderate/severe renal impairment at baseline (n=49) were treated with aflibercept 
in these trials. In these patients, a >10% all grades higher incidence in dehydration was noted while 
other non-renal events were generally comparable to that of patients without renal impairment. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No drug-drug interaction studies were submitted (see discussion on clinical pharmacology).

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In total 2073 patients treated with aflibercept and 1354 patients who received placebo and harbouring 
solid tumours were included in the integrated safety database. The pivotal safety population consists of 
all patients in the EFC10262 trial receiving at least one dose of study therapy, 605 in the placebo arm 
and 611 in the aflibercept arm (in total 1216 patients). A meta-analysis of certain selected side effects 
considered to be of special interest encompassing all 3 phase III studies was presented. The safety 
data base in mCRC is considered to be large enough for assessment of the benefit-risk balance. 
The toxic potential of aflibercept when combined with FOLFIRI was clearly reflected by the higher 
treatment discontinuation rates, both premature (not all treatment components) and permanent (all 
treatment components), dose modifications of 5-FU and irinotecan, and cycle delays seen in the 
experimental arm (data not shown). Of note, treatment-emergent AEs led to permanent 
discontinuation of treatment in 26.8% of patients in the aflibercept arm compared to 12.1% of patients 
in the placebo arm. This means that not all aflibercept-associated side effects are clinically 
manageable. 
Grade 3-4 TEAEs occurred in 83.5% of patients in the aflibercept arm compared to 62.5% in the 
placebo arm while serious TEAEs were reported in 48.1% of patients in the aflibercept arm compared 
to 32.7% in the placebo arm. Not unexpected, an increased frequency of typical anti-VEGF class side 
effects, including e.g. hypertension, proteinuria and haemorrhage, as well as of side effects associated 
with the chemotherapy backbone was seen in the aflibercept arm. 
More patients in the aflibercept arm died from AE (2.3% vs 0.7%) while more patients in the placebo 
arm died from progressive disease (72% vs 60%). Fatal AEs in other context than disease progression 
in the safety database included infection (also in context of neutropenia), hypovolaemia/dehydration, 
and haemorrhage. 
Zaltrap is contraindicated in case of hypersensitivity to aflibercept or to any of its excipients. 
Ophthalmic / intravitreal use is also contraindicated due to the hyperosmotic properties of Zaltrap. This 
information is included in section 4.3 of the SmPC. 
The following warnings have been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. As appropriate, relevant dosing 
recommendations have been included in section 4.2 of the SmPC and information has been included 
under the description of selected adverse reactions in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
- An increased risk of haemorrhage, including severe and sometimes fatal haemorrhagic events has 
been reported in patients treated with aflibercept. Patients should be monitored for signs and 
symptoms of gastrointestinal bleeding and other severe bleeding. Aflibercept should not be 
administered to patients with severe haemorrhage. Thrombocytopenia has been reported in patients 
treated with the Zaltrap/FOLFIRI regimen. Monitoring of complete blood count (CBC) with platelets is 
recommended at baseline, prior to initiation of each cycle of aflibercept, and as clinically necessary. 
Administration of the Zaltrap/FOLFIRI should be delayed until platelet count is ≥75 x 109/L.  
- Gastrointestinal perforation including fatal GI perforation has been reported in patients treated with 
aflibercept. Patients should be monitored for signs and symptoms of GI perforation. Aflibercept 
treatment should be discontinued in patients who experience GI perforation. 
- Fistula formation involving gastrointestinal and non-gastrointestinal sites has occurred in patients 
treated with aflibercept. Aflibercept treatment should be discontinued in patients who develop fistula. 
- An increased risk of grade 3-4 hypertension (including hypertension and one case of essential 
hypertension) has been observed in patients treated with the Zaltrap/FOLFIRI regimen. Pre existing 
hypertension must be adequately controlled before starting aflibercept. If hypertension cannot be 
Zaltrap 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 76/91 
 
 
 
adequately controlled, treatment with aflibercept should not be initiated. It is recommended to monitor 
blood pressure every two weeks, including before each administration or as clinically indicated during 
treatment with aflibercept. In the event of hypertension on aflibercept treatment, blood pressure 
should be controlled with appropriate anti hypertensive therapy and blood pressure should be 
monitored regularly. In case of severe hypertension, the treatment should be suspended until 
controlled and the aflibercept dose should be reduced to 2 mg/kg for subsequent cycles. Aflibercept 
should be permanently discontinued if hypertension cannot be adequately managed with appropriate 
anti hypertensive therapy, or if hypertensive crisis or hypertensive encephalopathy occurs. 
- Hypertension may exacerbate underlying cardiovascular disease. Caution should be exercised when 
treating patients with history of clinically significant cardiovascular disease such as coronary artery 
disease, or congestive heart failure with Zaltrap. Patients with NYHA class III or IV congestive heart 
failure should not be treated with Zaltrap. 
- Arterial thromboembolic events (ATE) (including transient ischaemic attack, cerebrovascular accident, 
angina pectoris, intracardiac thrombus, myocardial infarction, arterial embolism, and ischaemic colitis) 
have been observed in patients treated with aflibercept. Aflibercept treatment should be discontinued 
in patients who experience an ATE. Venous thromboembolic events (VTE) including deep vein 
thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (infrequently fatal) have been reported in patients treated 
with aflibercept. Zaltrap should be discontinued in patients with life threatening (Grade 4) 
thromboembolic events (including pulmonary embolism). Patients with Grade 3 DVT should be treated 
with anticoagulation as clinically indicated, and aflibercept therapy should be continued. In the event of 
recurrence, despite appropriate anticoagulation, aflibercept treatment should be discontinued. Patients 
with thromboembolic events of Grade 3 or lower need to be closely monitored.  
- Severe proteinuria, nephrotic syndrome, and thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) have been observed 
in patients treated with aflibercept. Proteinuria should be monitored by urine dipstick analysis and 
urinary protein creatinine ratio (UPCR) for the development or worsening of proteinuria before each 
aflibercept administration. Patients with a UPCR >1 should undergo a 24 hour urine collection. 
Aflibercept administration should be suspended for ≥2 grams of proteinuria/24 hours and restarted 
when proteinuria is <2 grams/24 hours. If there is recurrence, the administration should be suspended 
until <2 grams/24 hours and then the dose reduced to 2 mg/kg. Aflibercept treatment should be 
discontinued in patients who develop nephrotic syndrome or TMA. 
- A higher incidence of neutropenic complications (febrile neutropenia and neutropenic infection) has 
been observed in patients treated with the Zaltrap/FOLFIRI regimen. Monitoring of complete blood 
count (CBC) with differential count is recommended at baseline and prior to initiation of each cycle of 
aflibercept. Administration of Zaltrap/FOLFIRI should be delayed until neutrophil count is ≥1.5 x 109/L. 
Therapeutic use of G CSF at first occurrence of grade ≥3 neutropenia and secondary prophylaxis may 
be considered in patients who may be at increased risk for neutropenia complications. 
- In the pivotal study of MCRC patients, diarrhoea and dehydration (all grade and grade 3-4) was 
observed more frequently in patients treated with Zaltrap compared to patients treated with placebo. 
Dose modification of FOLFIRI regimen, anti diarrhoeal medicinal products, and rehydration should be 
instituted as needed. 
- In the pivotal study of MCRC patients, severe hypersensitivity reactions were reported in 0.3% of 
patients treated with Zaltrap and 0.5% of patients treated with placebo. In the event of a severe 
hypersensitivity reaction (including bronchospasm, dyspnoea, angioedema, and anaphylaxis), 
aflibercept should be discontinued and appropriate medical measures should be administered. In the 
event of a mild to moderate hypersensitivity reaction to Zaltrap (including flushing, rash, urticaria, and 
pruritus), aflibercept should be temporarily suspended until the reaction is resolved. Treatment with 
corticosteroids and/or antihistamines can be initiated as clinically indicated. Pre treatment with 
Zaltrap 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 77/91 
 
 
 
corticosteroids and/or antihistamines may be considered in subsequent cycles (see section 4.2). 
Caution should be used when retreating patients with prior hypersensitivity reactions as recurrent 
hypersensitivity reactions have been observed in some patients despite prophylaxis, including 
corticosteroids. 
- Aflibercept impaired wound healing in animal models (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). 
Potential for compromised wound healing (wound dehiscence, anastomotic leakage) has been reported 
with aflibercept. Aflibercept should be suspended for at least 4 weeks prior to elective surgery. It is 
recommended that aflibercept not be initiated for at least 4 weeks following major surgery and not 
until the surgical wound is fully healed. For minor surgery such as central venous access port 
placement, biopsy, and tooth extraction, aflibercept may be initiated/restarted once the surgical wound 
is fully healed. Aflibercept should be discontinued in patients with compromised wound healing 
requiring medical intervention. 
- Reversible posterior (leuko)encephalopathy syndrome (RPLS/PRES), a serious but known anti-VEGF 
class effect was not reported in the pivotal phase III study of MCRC patients. In other studies, PRES 
was reported in patients treated with aflibercept as monotherapy and in combination with other 
chemotherapies. PRES may present with altered mental status, seizure, nausea, vomiting, headache, 
or visual disturbances. The diagnosis of PRES is confirmed by brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
(MRI). Aflibercept should be discontinued in patients that develop PRES. 
- Elderly patients ≥65 years had an increased risk of diarrhoea, dizziness, asthenia, weight loss and 
dehydration. Careful monitoring is recommended in order to rapidly detect and treat signs and 
symptoms of diarrhoea and dehydration and to minimise potential risk. Safety in elderly patients is 
included as important missing information in the RMP. An observational cohort study will provide 
further safety information in this patient population. 
- The safety of aflibercept in patients with severe liver or renal impairment is unknown, and 
information is limited for patients with moderate organ impairment. Patients with ECOG performance 
status ≥2 or having significant co morbidities may be at greater risk for a poor clinical outcome and 
should be carefully monitored for early clinical deterioration. There were no noteworthy differences 
between males and females in pivotal study. Analyses according to race were not preformed as the 
large majority (87.3%) of patients were Caucasians. Safety in patients with ECOG PS ≥2, non-
caucasian patients or patients with renal or hepatic impairment is included as important missing 
information in the RMP. An observational cohort study will provide further safety information in non-
caucasian patients or patients with renal or hepatic impairment. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. With regard to selected adverse reactions: 
- Infections occurred at a higher frequency in patients receiving Zaltrap than in patients receiving 
placebo, including urinary tract infection, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, 
pneumonia, catheter site infection and tooth infection.  
- As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with Zaltrap. Overall across 
all clinical oncology studies, similar incidence of low titre anti drug antibody (ADA) responses (post 
baseline) in the ADA assay were observed in both patients treated with placebo and Zaltrap. High titre 
antibody responses to aflibercept were not detected in any patients. Some patients were also positive 
in the neutralising antibody assay. In the pivotal study of MCRC patients, positive responses in the ADA 
assay were observed at higher levels in patients treated with placebo than with Zaltrap. Positive results 
in the neutralising antibody assay in the MCRC pivotal study were also higher in patients treated with 
the placebo. There was no observed impact on the pharmacokinetic profile of aflibercept in patients 
who were positive in the immunogenicity assays. Given the similar ADA assay results in patients 
Zaltrap 
CHMP assessment report  
Page 78/91 
 
 
 
treated with placebo or Zaltrap, the actual incidence of immunogenicity with Zaltrap based on these 
assays is likely to be overestimated.   
Immunogenicity data are highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the assay. Additionally, 
the observed incidence of antibody positivity in an assay may be influenced by several factors, 
including sample handling, timing of sample collection, concomitant medicinal products, and underlying 
disease. For these reasons, comparison of the incidence of antibodies to Zaltrap with the incidence of 
antibodies to other products may be misleading. 
There are no data from the use of aflibercept in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see discussion on non-clinical aspects). As angiogenesis is critical to foetal 
development, the inhibition of angiogenesis following administration of Zaltrap may result in adverse 
effects on pregnancy. Zaltrap should be used only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risk 
during pregnancy. If the patient becomes pregnant while taking Zaltrap, the patient should be 
informed of the potential hazard to the foetus. This information was included in section 4.6 of the 
SmPC. 
No studies have been conducted to assess the impact of Zaltrap on milk production, its presence in 
breast milk or its effects on the breast fed child. It is unknown whether aflibercept is excreted in 
human milk. A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to 
discontinue breast feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Zaltrap therapy taking into account the 
benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. This information was 
included in section 4.6 of the SmPC. 
Zaltrap has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If patients are 
experiencing symptoms that affect their vision or concentration, or their ability to react, they should be 
advised not to drive or use machines. This information was included in section 4.7 of the SmPC. 
There is no information on the safety of aflibercept given at doses exceeding 7 mg/kg every 2 weeks or 
9 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The most commonly observed adverse reactions at these doses were similar 
to those observed at the therapeutic dose. There is no specific antidote to Zaltrap overdose. Cases of 
overdose should be managed by appropriate supportive measures particularly with regards to 
monitoring and treatment of hypertension and proteinuria. The patient should remain under close 
medical supervision to monitor any adverse reactions. This information was included in section 4.9 of 
the SmPC. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The size of the presented database is considered to be large enough for assessment of the benefit-risk 
balance. A substantially higher rate of treatment discontinuation, dose modifications of 5-
FU/irinotecan, and cycle delays in the experimental arm all show an important toxic potential of 
aflibercept when combined with FOLFIRI. The frequency of TEAEs grade 3-4, serious TEAEs, and fatal 
AEs were all considerably higher in the experimental arm including typical anti-VEGF class side effects 
as well as those associated with the chemotherapy backbone. Patients ≥65 years constitute a 
vulnerable group. RPLS/PRES has been reported in 18 patients in the aflibercept experience. It is 
concluded that the addition of aflibercept to FOLFIRI is associated with significant toxicity that not 
always is manageable and for certain patients ultimately leads to termination also of the 5-
FU/irinotecan backbone.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
First line treatment of metastasing colorectal cancer (mCRC) in Europe commonly consists of a 
combination of 5-FU, leucovorin, and irinotecan (FOLFIRI) followed by second line treatment with a 
combination of 5-FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin (FOLFOX), or the reverse chronological order. There is 
no data to support superiority of any of the orders. The anti-VEGF compound bevacizumab is licensed 
for the treatment of mCRC but regional differences in its use are at hand, with a substantial higher 
fraction of patients in US being exposed to the drug in the first line setting compared to European 
patients. 
Aflibercept is a novel anti-VEGF compound with a broader target range than bevacizumab. With the 
present application, licensure for aflibercept in combination with the FOLFIRI backbone in the 2nd line 
setting of mCRC after failure of an oxaliplatin-containing regimen is sought. Data from a single 
placebo-controlled phase III pivotal study, EFC10262, is presented. 
The rationales for choice of dose and companion drugs are accepted. The results are considered valid 
for the EU. No major concerns regarding the conduct of the study are noted. 
The primary efficacy endpoint, overall survival, was evaluated in the ITT population consisting of 612 
patients in the aflibercept arm and 614 patients in the placebo arm. The analysis was based on 
reasonably mature data and performed after a median follow-up time of 22.3 months. A statistically 
significant difference in overall survival between the study arms was noted, stratified HR 0.817 
(95.34% CI: 0.713 to 0.937), p=0.0032. The difference in median OS was 1.44 months in favour of 
the aflibercept arm, 13.50 months (95.34% CI:12.517 to 14.949) in the aflibercept arm compared to 
12.06 months (11.072 to 13.109) in the placebo arm. Sensitivity analyses were in support of the 
primary analysis. A sustained positive effect of aflibercept was still present at 30 months with a 
survival probability two-fold higher than in the placebo arm (22.3% vs 12%). 
Progression-free survival according to independent review was a secondary endpoint, performed at the 
second interim analysis and subject to a highly conservative split of alpha level with overall survival. 
Median PFS was 2.23 months significantly longer in the aflibercept arm (6.90 months) than in the 
placebo arm (4.67 months); stratified HR 0.758 (99.99% CI: 0.578-0.995), p=0.00007. The sensitivity 
analyses performed are considered to be in support of the primary analysis, although the difference 
between study arms was not formally statistically significant in the investigators’ assessment-based 
analysis. 
Overall objective response rate, performed in the evaluable population, was a secondary endpoint and 
showed a significantly better response rate in the aflibercept arm, 19.8% (95%CI: 16.4-23.2%) vs 
11.1% (8.5-13.8%) in the placebo arm, stratified p=0.0001. 
Thus, the results of the secondary analyses support the beneficial treatment effect seen with the 
addition of aflibercept to FOLFIRI in the primary analysis of overall survival. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
A numerically lower treatment effect on OS with the Zaltrap/FOLFIRI regimen was reported for patients 
with prior bevacizumab as compared to patients without prior bevacizumab exposure. Considering that 
this result was based on a subgroup analysis and that there was no evidence of heterogeneity in 
treatment effect (non significant interaction test), the CHMP considered that this did not raise concern.

A biomarker program encompassing the EFC10262, EFC10668 and EFC11338 studies has been 
initiated. The results of these studies may aid in the selection of patients for treatment with aflibercept 
and should be presented to the EMA as a post-authorisation commitment which is considered key to 
the benefit-risk balance. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Treatment-emergent AEs led to permanent discontinuation of treatment in 26.8% of patients in the 
aflibercept arm compared to 12.1% of patients in the placebo arm, clearly reflecting the toxic potential 
of the study drug when combined with FOLFIRI. Furthermore, substantially more dose modifications 
and premature discontinuation of all study drugs as well as cycle delays were seen in the experimental 
arm.  
Grade 3-4 TEAEs occurred in 83.5% of patients in the aflibercept arm compared to 62.5% in the 
placebo arm. Events with a frequency ≥2% higher in the aflibercept arm included diarrhoea, 
hypertension, asthenic conditions, stomatitis and ulceration, and dehydration. 
Serious TEAEs were reported in 48.1% of patients in the aflibercept arm compared to 32.7% in the 
placebo arm. The most common SAE (SOC, all grades) and also with the largest difference versus 
placebo was gastrointestinal disorders (20% vs 11%) followed by infection and infestations (11.3% vs 
6.3%). 
While more patients in the placebo arm died from progressive disease (72% vs 60%) more patients in 
the aflibercept arm died from AE (all within 30 days from last dose, 2.3% vs 0.7%). Fatal AEs in other 
context than disease progression in the safety database include, but are not restricted to, infection 
(also in context of neutropenia), hypovolaemia and dehydration, and haemorrhage. 
Aflibercept is associated anti-VEGF class side effects. Deduced from the meta-analysis including data 
from the 3 phase III studies, potential aflibercept-associated anti-VEGF class side effects considered to 
be of major clinical importance due to increased risk are: Hypertension (RR = 4.24 compared to 
placebo), haemorrhage (RR = 2.16), GI and non-GI fistulae (OR = 4.57). 
Addition of aflibercept also increased the frequency of certain AEs associated with irinotecan and 5-FU, 
including diarrhoea, neutropenia, and stomatitis. 
Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome, a serious but known anti-VEGF class effect, has 
been reported in 18 patients (0.5%) in the aflibercept experience, including cases associated with 
single drug therapy. This is within the range reported for other anti-VEGF compounds. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
In elderly patients ≥65 years the incidence of specific AEs, such as diarrhoea, dizziness, asthenia, 
weight decrease and dehydration was ≥5% higher than in the younger population. These data should 
not be underestimated, considering the CRC epidemiology. Further information on elderly patients is 
expected from an observational cohort study. 
The safety of aflibercept in patients with severe liver or renal impairment is unknown and restricted 
information exists for patients with moderate organ impairment. This information is included in section 
4.4 of the SmPC and organ impairment is included as important missing information in the RMP also to 
be addressed via an observational cohort study as additional pharmacovigilance activity.

Preclinical findings suggest a possible risk for decreased bone metabolism and it is not clear whether 
this translates into clinical relevance in terms of prolonged fracture healing. As a result, osteonecrosis, 
delayed fracture healing and bone exostosis are included as important potential risks in the RMP. These 
will also be addressed via an observational cohort study as additional pharmacovigilance activity. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
In the 2nd line setting of mCRC a median OS of approximately 10-13 months is currently expected. An 
overall survival benefit of HR 0.817, albeit robust, is considered as a relatively modest clinical benefit.  
The toxicity of aflibercept when combined with FOLFIRI is generally considered pronounced with a 
treatment discontinuation rate of 26.8% and a substantially larger fraction of patients experiencing all 
types of AEs than in the placebo arm. 
Benefit-risk balance 
In terms of balance of benefits and risks, the overall toxicity of aflibercept in the studied combination 
regimen was considered significant, not always manageable, and in some patients ultimately leading to 
termination also of the chemotherapy. However, despite this toxicity, there was still a small but 
clinically significant survival advantage. Thus, the benefits associated with aflibercept were considered 
to outweigh the risks.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
In order to optimise benefit–risk balance, it is essential to identify the proper target population for 
therapy. This might be possible to accomplish through the judicious use of biomarkers in all phases of 
clinical drug development. Regrettably, no validated predictive serum or plasma biomarkers have been 
identified during the development of aflibercept that correlate with treatment outcomes. Thus, the EMA 
has requested to the applicant company to analyse plasma and tissue samples from the available 
trials, with the primary aim to identify biomarkers to allow better selection of the population likely to 
experience a beneficial effect following treatment with aflibercept.  
4. Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority 
decision that the risk-benefit balance of Zaltrap in combination with irinotecan/5-fluorouracil/folinic 
acid (FOLFIRI) chemotherapy in the treatment of adults with metastatic colorectal cancer (MCRC) that 
is resistant to or has progressed after an oxaliplatin-containing regimen is favourable and therefore 
recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (See Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2).

Divergent positions to the majority recommendation are appended to this report. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of data on the quality properties of the active substance, the CHMP 
considers that aflibercept is qualified as a new active substance.

DIVERGENT POSITION EXPRESSED BY CHMP MEMBERS 
Although aflibercept exerts an anti angiogenesis activity, the favourable effects are considered modest. 
The toxicity is substantial. In the overall population, the observed improvement in OS by 1.44 month is 
associated with a 2.23 months gain in median PFS. This is considered of modest clinical relevance and 
not able to outweigh the substantial risks related to treatment with aflibercept.  
In the sub-group of patients pre-treated with bevacizumab the even smaller activity reported (when 
compared with bevacizumab naïve patients) is a major concern, in particular since most patients with 
mCRC will be treated with bevacizumab as part of first line palliative treatment in line with the current 
EU treatment guidelines. This population has not been sufficiently addressed and no markers are 
defined to distinguish patients that may encounter clinically relevant results. This will probably never 
be further addressed after the marketing of aflibercept. 
Crucial questions on the benefit-risk balance of this medicinal product will thus remain unanswered and 
all in all the benefit/risk is considered negative.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for ipilimumab, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
A cumulative review on Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN) from clinical trials and post-marketing 
setting for ipilimumab has resulted in a total of 8 cases, including fatal cases. One fatal case was 
thought to be related to sequential therapy of nivolumab and ipilimumab. Therefore, in view of 
available data, the PRAC agreed that changes to the product information are warranted to include a 
new warning against introducing a patient on ipilimumab who had previously experienced a severe 
or life-threatening skin adverse reaction on a prior cancer immune stimulatory therapy. 
In addition, during the reporting period, 4 cases of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic 
Symptoms (DRESS) associated with ipilimumab have been identified. Therefore this adverse 
reaction and a corresponding warning should be included in the product information. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding ipilimumab, the PRAC considered that changes to the 
product information were warranted.The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the 
PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ipilimumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product containing ipilimumab is favourable subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisations should be varied.

PART VI:  SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of Risk Management Plan for Kyprolis (Carfilzomib) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Kyprolis.  The RMP details 
important risks of Kyprolis, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information 
will be obtained about Kyprolis's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Kyprolis's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Kyprolis should be 
used. 
This summary of the RMP for Kyprolis should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all of which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Kyprolis's RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
Kyprolis is authorized for the treatment of adult patients with multiple myeloma who have 
received at least one prior therapy in combination with either lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone or dexamethasone alone (see SmPC for the full indication).  It contains 
carfilzomib as the active substance and it is given by intravenous route of administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of Kyprolis’s benefits can be found in Kyprolis’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage:  
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/Kyprolis. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or further 
characterize the risks  
Important risks of Kyprolis, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Kyprolis's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
 
•
•
The authorized pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to
ensure that the medicine is used correctly;
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the public (eg,
with or without prescription) can help to minimizes its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected 
continuously and regularly analyzed including Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 
assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary.  These measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
II.A.  List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of Kyprolis are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered.  Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks 
are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Kyprolis.  
Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is 
possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs further evaluation.  Missing information refers to information on the safety of the 
medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the 
long-term use of the medicine).

II.B.  Summary of Important Risks 
Important identified risk: Cardiac Toxicity (cardiac failure, myocardial ischemia, myocardial 
infarction and cardiac arrest) 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimization measures 
Data to evaluate safety concerns derive from clinical trials 
and postmarketing data.  The risk of cardiac toxicity with 
carfilzomib has been consistently reported from clinical 
trial data.  An increased incidence of cardiac failure with 
carfilzomib has been observed from clinical trial data and 
the strength of this evidence is strong. 
The risk of cardiac failure is increased in elderly patients 
(≥ 75 years) and in Asian patients.  Patients with NYHA 
Class III and IV heart failure, recent myocardial infarction, 
and conduction abnormalities uncontrolled by medications 
were not eligible for the clinical trials.  These patients may 
be at greater risk for cardiac complications. 
Routine risk minimization measures: 
•  SmPC Sections 4.2 and 4.4 where advice is given on 
monitoring volume overload/fluid 
requirements/hydration 
•  SmPC Section 4.4 where recommendation is given for 
stopping Kyprolis until recovery 
•  SmPC Section 4.4 where recommendation is given for 
caution in treating patients with NYHA Class III and IV 
heart failure, recent myocardial infarctions and 
conduction abnormalities 
•  SmPC Sections 4.8 and 5.3 
•  PL Sections 2 and 4 
Additional risk minimization measures: 
•  None 
Important identified risk: Pulmonary Toxicities 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
The data identifying pulmonary toxicities derive from 
clinical trials as well as postmarketing data.  The strength 
of the evidence is strong. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
No risk factors are known. 
Risk minimization measures 
Routine risk minimization measures: 
•  SmPC Section 4.4 where recommendation is given 
evaluating and stopping Kyprolis until recovery.

Important identified risk: Pulmonary Hypertension 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
The data identifying pulmonary hypertension derive from 
clinical trials as well as postmarketing data.  The strength 
of the evidence is strong. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimization measures 
Patients with NYHA Class III and IV heart failure, 
myocardial infarction in the preceding 6 months, and 
conduction abnormalities uncontrolled by medications 
were excluded from clinical trials with carfilzomib, as they 
may be at greater risk of cardio-pulmonary complications. 
Routine risk minimization measures: 
•  SmPC Section 4.4 where recommendation is given for 
stopping Kyprolis until recovery 
•  SmPC Sections 4.8 and 5.3 
•  PL Sections 2 and 4 
Additional risk minimization measures: 
•  None 
Important identified risk: Dyspnea 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Data to evaluate safety concerns derive from clinical trials 
and postmarketing data. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimization measures 
Dyspnea was associated with either cough or lower 
respiratory tract infection in more than 50% of subjects.  
Dyspnea has also been noted within a day of dosing as 
part of the constellation of symptoms associated with 
infusion reactions.  Based on a review of medical history 
for subjects who had an on-trial event of dyspnea or 
cough in clinical trials with carfilzomib, no risk factors for 
dyspnea or cough could be identified. 
Routine risk minimization measures: 
•  SmPC Section 4.4 where advice is given to evaluate 
event to exclude cardiopulmonary conditions and 
stop Kyprolis in subjects with Grade 3 or 4 dyspnea 
until resolved or returned to baseline 
•  SmPC Section 4.8 
•  PL Sections 2 and 4 
Additional risk minimization measures: 
•  None 
 
 
 
Important identified risk:  Hypertension Including Hypertensive Crises 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
The risk of hypertension with carfilzomib has been 
consistently reported from clinical trial data.  An increased 
incidence of hypertension with carfilzomib has been 
observed from clinical trial data and the strength of this 
evidence is strong. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
No risk factors are known. 
Risk minimization measures 
Routine risk minimization measures: 
•  SmPC Section 4.4 where advice is given to control 
hypertension prior to Kyprolis treatment, routine 
evaluate and reduce or stop Kyprolis if event not 
resolved 
•  SmPC Section 4.8 
•  PL Sections 2 and 4 
Additional risk minimization measures: 
•  None 
Important identified risk:  Acute Renal Failure 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine

evidence is strong. 
In clinical trials, the risk of renal failure events was higher 
in subjects with baseline characteristics suggestive of 
poor prognosis (such as increased beta-2-microglobulin 
and poorer overall performance status), and with impaired 
renal function at baseline. 
Routine risk minimization measures: 
•  SmPC Section 4.2 where advice is given regarding 
reduction for starting dose of lenalidomide in patients 
with baseline renal impairment and monitoring during 
Kypolis treatment 
•  SmPC Section 4.4 where recommendation is given for 
monitoring of renal failure. 
•  SmPC Sections 4.8, 5.2, and 5.3 
•  PL Sections 2 and 4

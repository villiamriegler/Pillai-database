1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Roche Registration Limited submitted on 20 April 2016 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Tecentriq, through the centralised 
procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 3 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The 
eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 18 December 2014.  
The applicant applied for the following indications  
 
Tecentriq is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
urothelial carcinoma after prior chemotherapy or who are considered cisplatin ineligible. 
 
Tecentriq is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after prior chemotherapy. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated 
that atezolizumab was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain tests or studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decisions PIP 
P/0220/2015 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0220/2015 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
NSCLC 
Data to support the application for atezolizumab monotherapy in patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC after prior chemotherapy are derived from two pivotal studies POPLAR and BIRCH, 
and two supportive Studies FIR and PCD4989g NSCLC Cohort. During the procedure the Applicant 
provided the results from the phase III OAK study. The Applicant seeks the following indication: 
Tecentriq is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after prior chemotherapy. 
UC 
Data to support the application for atezolizumab monotherapy in patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic UC or who are considered cisplatin ineligible are derived primarily from two studies: Pivotal 
Phase II Study IMvigor 210 and a supportive Phase Ia Study (PCD4989g). In addition, the applicant 
provided efficacy results of Study IMvigor 211. The Applicant seeks the following indication: 
Tecentriq is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial 
carcinoma after prior chemotherapy or who are considered cisplatin ineligible. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
NSCLC 
Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide in men and the second leading 
cause of cancer deaths worldwide in women. It accounted for approximately 13% of all new cancers in 
2012 (Torre et al. 2015). Non-small cell lung cancer is the predominant subtype, accounting for 
approximately 85% of all cases (Howlader et al. 2014; Molina et al. 2008). 
UC 
Urothelial carcinoma presents the highest recurrence rate among solid tumors and is the second 
leading cause of death in genitourinary cancers. Despite recent advances in the understanding of the 
pathophysiology of the disease, the management of UC patients remains a clinically challenging 
problem (Siegel et al. 2014).  
Approximately 10%-15% of patients present with metastatic UC at the time of diagnosis. Despite the 
low frequency of de novo disease, approximately half of the patients with locally advanced UC progress 
to metastatic disease within two years of cystectomy. 
2.1.3.  Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
Identification of cancer T-lymphocyte inhibitory signals, including PD-L1, has led to an important 
milestone in the development of effective cancer immunotherapies. These immune checkpoint 
inhibitors can prevent tumours from eluding immunosurveillance by removing an inhibitory signal 
Assessment report  
EMA/153102/2018  
Page 9/205 
 
 
 
 
 
 
provided to T lymphocytes, thereby allowing their activation and consequently a cytotoxic attack on 
tumour cells. Checkpoint proteins that are targeted by checkpoint inhibitors in the clinic include 
cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL)–associated antigen 4 (CTLA4), PD-1, and PD-L1. Immune checkpoint 
inhibitors, including anti-PD-L1 antibodies, have shown impressive clinical activity as monotherapy in a 
broad range of tumors, including NSCLC and UC. Atezolizumab targets human PD-L1 on ICs as well as 
TCs and inhibits its interaction with its receptors, PD-1 and B7.1 (CD80, B7-1). Both these interactions 
are reported to provide inhibitory signals to T lymphocytes. Therapeutic blockade of PD-L1 by 
atezolizumab is expected to reinvigorate and enhance the magnitude of tumour specific T-lymphocyte 
responses, resulting in improved anti-tumour activity. In addition, inhibition of the interaction between 
PD-L1 and B7.1 may also aid in the priming of new anti-tumour immune responses. Expression of PD-
L1 within the tumour microenvironment has been observed to be focal in nature, consistent with the 
hypothesis that PD-L1 expression reflects areas of interaction between TCs and ICs. Programmed 
death ligand 1 expression likely represents a feedback mechanism, functioning at multiple levels to 
dampen T-helper type 1 (Th1)/CTL-driven immune responses. Treatment with inhibitors of PD-L1 can 
lead to further anti-tumour immune activity and spread of PD-L1 expression within the tumour 
microenvironment. Thus, the presence of PD-L1 in the tumour microenvironment may act as an 
indicator of the presence of an active anti-tumour immune response and/or an anti-tumour immune 
response that is being repressed by the presence of PD-L1. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
NSCLC 
The overall 5-year survival rate for advanced NSCLC is 2%-4%, depending on geographic location 
(Cetin et al. 2011). Poor prognostic factors for survival in patients with NSCLC include advanced stage 
of disease at the time of initial diagnosis, poor performance status (PS), and a history of unintentional 
weight loss. More than half of the patients with NSCLC are diagnosed with distant metastatic disease, 
which directly contributes to poor survival prospects. 
UC 
The overall 5-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with metastatic UC is approximately 5.5% 
(Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results [SEER] 2015). Poor prognostic factors for survival in 
patients with metastatic UC include advanced stage of disease at the time of initial diagnosis, 
Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) <80%, and visceral metastasis (i.e., lung, liver, or bone; Bajorin 
et al. 1999). 
The presence of these unfavorable features was associated with a median survival of 4 months 
compared with 18 months in patients without these features (Bellmunt et al. 2010; Loehrer et al. 
1992). 
2.1.5.  Management 
NSCLC 
Outcomes are poor for patients with previously treated, advanced or metastatic NSCLC; systemic 
chemotherapy (e.g., docetaxel) or erlotinib provides only modest benefit (Al-Farsi and Ellis 2014; 
Stinchcombe and Socinski 2008). Cancer immunotherapy represents a new treatment option for these 
patients. Despite improvements in the 1L treatment of patients with advanced NSCLC that have 
resulted in longer survival times and reduced disease-related symptoms, nearly all patients experience 
disease progression. Docetaxel, pemetrexed, and erlotinib are three single agents approved by the 
Assessment report  
EMA/153102/2018  
Page 10/205 
 
 
 
 
 
 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) for use in the second-line and beyond (2L+) setting for an 
unselected population. Docetaxel was the first agent to demonstrate a survival benefit, with respect to 
best supportive care (BSC) in patients with relapsed NSCLC following 1L therapy and was associated 
with objective response rates (ORR) in the range of 6% to 11% and an estimated median overall 
survival (OS) of 6 to 10 months (Taxotere EPAR). Pemetrexed appeared non-inferior to docetaxel on 
efficacy outcomes as 2L therapy in advanced NSCLC (all histologies); subsequent subgroup analysis 
revealed improved survival in patients with non-squamous histologies, thus limiting its approval to 
patients with non-squamous NSCLC (Alimta EPAR). Improved OS was observed with erlotinib 
compared to BSC in a randomized study that included patients with poor Eastern Cooperative Oncology 
Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) (Tarceva EPAR). Erlotinib has therefore often been used for 
patients, who cannot receive cytotoxic chemotherapy due to poor performance status. 
The choice of agent used for patients being treated in the 2L setting depends on a number of factors, 
including tumour histology, the patient’s comorbidities, toxicity from previous treatments, toxicity 
profile for a given agent, smoking history, and patient preference. Overall, the therapeutic index of 
these 2L NSCLC therapies has been restricted both by limited survival benefit and significant toxicities 
such as myelosuppression and neuropathy (docetaxel), diarrhoea (pemetrexed, erlotinib), and rash 
(erlotinib) (Stinchcombe and Socinski 2008). 
Most recently, EMA and the FDA approved nivolumab and pembrolizumab for the treatment of 
metastatic 2L NSCLC with an improvement in OS.  
UC 
First-line Treatment for Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma 
Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is the preferred 1L therapy and has been shown to improve survival in 
patients with previously untreated metastatic UC (Loehrer et al. 1992; von der Maase et al. 2005). 
Cisplatin and gemcitabine (in combination with cisplatin; European Union only) are approved for 1L 
therapy; however, there are currently no approved 1L therapies for patients who have a 
contraindication to cisplatin or who are otherwise medically unfit for a cisplatin-based regimen. 
Treatments Available for Patients with Previously Untreated Cisplatin-Ineligible Metastatic Urothelial 
Carcinoma: Historical Evidence and Treatment Guidelines 
Patients who are medically unfit for cisplatin constitute a heterogeneous population, ranging from 
those who can tolerate the toxicity of combination chemotherapy to those who invariably cannot 
tolerate chemotherapy. This includes patients who are frail due to preexisting co-morbidities such as 
renal impairment, myelosuppression or hearing impairment, as well as those with a history of an 
allergy to cisplatin or other platinum containing regimens. While allergies to cisplatin are infrequent in 
the first cycle, the incidence increases significantly with subsequent cycles. 
For patients who are unable to receive cisplatin, options comprise a carboplatin-based regimen 
(carboplatin plus gemcitabine or carboplatin, gemcitabine plus paclitaxel), non-platinum based 
combination (e.g., paclitaxel plus gemcitabine), single-agent chemotherapy, BSC, and inclusion in 
clinical studies. According to the European Association of Urology (EAU) guidelines (Witjes et al. 2015), 
there is no defined standard chemotherapy for cisplatin-ineligible (medically unfit) patients with 
advanced or metastatic UC (level of evidence 2B), and the guidelines recommend the use of 
carboplatin combination chemotherapy or single agents, (Grading of Recommendation C). Treatment 
with carboplatin-containing combination chemotherapy, preferably with gemcitabine/carboplatin, is 
also recommended for patients with PS2 or impaired renal function, as well as for patients with 0 or 1 
poor Bajorin prognostic factors and impaired renal function (Grading of Recommendation B; Witjes et 
al. 2015). 
Assessment report  
EMA/153102/2018  
Page 11/205 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Similarly, the ESMO guidelines (Bellmunt et al. 2014) recommend use of carboplatin-based regimens 
or single agents (taxane, gemcitabine) for cisplatin ineligible patients and BSC or inclusion in a clinical 
study for patients with PS >=2 and poor renal function. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network 
(NCCN) guidelines (2015) recommend participation in clinical studies or carboplatin- or taxane-based 
regimens, based on 2B level of evidence. 
Second-Line Treatment for Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma 
Despite the efficacy of 1L regimens for patients treated with cisplatin-based regimens, responses 
showed limited durability, with nearly all patients experiencing disease progression. There is currently 
only one approved 2L therapy in the European Union (vinflunine). The approval of vinflunine was based 
on data from a single randomized Phase III study that compared vinflunine plus BSC with BSC alone in 
370 patients with advanced UC progressing after a platinum-containing therapy. Taxanes (paclitaxel 
and docetaxel) are commonly used as 2L therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC.  
About the product 
Atezolizumab targets human PD-L1 on ICs and TCs and inhibits its interaction with its receptors, PD-1 
and B7.1 (CD80, B7-1). Clinical studies utilizing anti-PD-1 antibodies (nivolumab, pembrolizumab) 
have established the therapeutic value of targeting the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway (Borghaei et al. 2015; 
Brahmer et al. 2015; Garon et al. 2015; Herbst et al. 2015). 
The authorised indications for atezolizumab are: 
Tecentriq as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) after prior platinum-containing chemotherapy or who are 
considered cisplatin ineligible. 
Tecentriq as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after prior chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR activating 
mutations or ALK-positive tumour mutations should also have received targeted therapy before 
receiving Tecentriq. 
Atezolizumab must be initiated and supervised by physicians experienced in the treatment of cancer. 
The recommended dose of atezolizumab is 1,200 mg administered intravenously every three weeks.  
It is recommended that patients are treated with atezolizumab until loss of clinical benefit (see 
section 5.1) or unmanageable toxicity. 
If a planned dose of atezolizumab is missed, it should be administered as soon as possible; it is 
recommended not to wait until the next planned dose. The schedule of administration must be 
adjusted to maintain a 3-week interval between doses.  
Dose reductions of atezolizumab are not recommended.

patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC who have not received prior systemic therapy and 
who are ineligible to receive cisplatin-based therapy.   
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Atezolizumab is an Fc-engineered, humanised IgG1 anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) 
monoclonal antibody produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology. 
PD-L1 may be expressed on tumour cells and/or tumour-infiltrating immune cells, and can contribute 
to the inhibition of the anti-tumour immune response in the tumour microenvironment. 
The proposed mechanism of action of atezolizumab involves a direct binding of atezolizumab to the PD-
L1 interface of the PD-L1:PD-1 and PD-L1:B7.1 binding sites, thus blocking the ability of PD-L1 to 
interact with these receptors. Disrupting the PD-L1/PD-1 and PD-L1/B7.1 pathways abrogates 
inhibition of antitumor T-cell activity. 
Tecentriq is presented as concentrate for solution for infusion. One vial of 20 mL concentrate contains 
1,200 mg atezolizumab, corresponding to a concentration before dilution of 60 mg/mL. Atezolizumab is 
formulated with L-histidine, glacial acetic acid, sucrose, polysorbate 20 and water for injections. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Atezolizumab is a humanised monoclonal antibody based on a human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) 
framework that contains heavy chain VHIII and light chain VκI subgroup sequences. The recombinant 
Assessment report  
EMA/153102/2018  
Page 15/205 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
antibody is produced in CHO cells and consists of two heavy chains (448 amino acid residues each) and 
two light chains (214 amino acid residues each). 
By design, atezolizumab incorporates an amino acid substitution (asparagine to alanine) at position 
298 in the CH2 domain of each heavy chain. This substitution results in a non-glycosylated antibody 
that has minimal binding to Fcγ receptors and thereby prevents Fc-effector function and depletion of 
cells expressing programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) at expected concentrations in humans. 
Product variants resulting from the post-translational modifications commonly present in CHO-derived 
monoclonal antibodies are observed for atezolizumab. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Introduction to the Quality by Design (QbD) approach 
It should be noted that the QbD approach applied for Tecentriq (Figure 1 is comparable to the one that 
has been used for the product and process development of two of Roche’s licensed products (Perjeta 
and Gazyvaro).  
Overall, the design space claimed is based on the outcome of the process characterisation / process 
validation (PC/PV) studies as well as platform knowledge, product characterisation and identified 
critical quality attributes (CQAs). 
The PALM plan (post-approval lifecycle management plan) for atezolizumab will contain elements covering 
process monitoring, control system updating and technical change management similar to the plans 
proposed for Perjeta and Gazyvaro. The approach provides assurance the process consistently 
produces material that meets all its CQAs and control strategy requirements throughout the product 
lifecycle.

Cell culture and harvest 
Atezolizumab is produced in a fed-batch process The source of cells is either the Master Cell Bank 
(MCB) or a Working Cell Bank (WCB) derived from the MCB. The cell culture process consists of three 
stages: seed train, inoculum train, and production culture. Upon completion of the production culture, 
atezolizumab in the cell culture fluid is physically separated from the CHO cells by harvesting via 
centrifugation and filtration. 
Purification 
Atezolizumab in the harvested cell culture fluid is initially purified by affinity chromatography, the 
recovered low pH pool is held to ensure potential viruses are inactivated, the pH adjusted affinity pool 
is further purified over a cation and anion chromatography step, and the pH adjusted anion exchange 
pool is filtered over a virus removal filter. The final step in the active substance purification process is 
concentration and buffer exchange to obtain the active substance specification (60 mg/mL 
atezolizumab in histidine acetate, sucrose, and polysorbate 20). The pool is 0.22 m filtered into a 
sterilised storage tank, frozen, and stored at ≤ -200C.  
Control of critical steps 
To ensure the quality of the active substance, in-process controls (IPCs) have been established. IPC 
tests and limits apply to the cell culture and harvest process steps and the purification process steps. 
Control of materials 
Atezolizumab is produced using a stably transfected CHO cell line. One of the clones resulting from this 
transfection was selected as the host cell for production cell-line construction. A two-tier cell banking 
system of master cell bank and working cell bank was developed and characterised in accordance with 
ICH guidelines. 
Process validation 
Development, characterisation, and validation of the atezolizumab process are based on a QbD 
approach. An overview of the QbD tools used is presented in Figure 1. 
Process characterisation and validation (PC/PV) studies were designed to demonstrate manufacturing 
process consistency for relevant product quality attributes and key performance indicators (KPIs) for 
CPPs and non-CPPs. These studies include a combination of qualified scale-down models and 
equipment and site-specific validation studies conducted at manufacturing scale. 
The results from characterisation studies are used to identify CPPs and support acceptable parameter 
ranges for commercial production. These studies were designed based on process understanding 
developed during process development, platform knowledge, and scientific and engineering principles.  
Manufacturing process development 
During pharmaceutical development, different versions of the active substance manufacturing process 
were used to manufacture atezolizumab for clinical trials. The manufacturing process is based on the 
Applicant’s CHO antibody manufacturing platform. 
The process changes occurring during development have been assessed for impact to product quality, 
and the atezolizumab manufactured at the commercial manufacturing site has been demonstrated to 
be comparable to the material used for clinical trials.

Characterisation 
Atezolizumab was extensively characterised in terms of physicochemical, biological, and 
immunochemical characteristics. 
Summary of physicochemical characteristics 
Atezolizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody based on an IgG1 (kappa) framework containing 
humanised heavy chain VHIII and light chain V kappa I subgroup sequences. The recombinant antibody 
is produced in CHO cells and consists of two heavy chains (448 amino acid residues each) and two light 
chains (214 amino acid residues each) with inter- and intrachain disulfide bonds that are typical of 
IgG1 antibodies. Atezolizumab was engineered to eliminate Fc-effector function via a single amino acid 
substitution (asparagine to alanine) at position 298 in the CH2 domain of the heavy chain, which 
results in a non-glycosylated antibody that has minimal binding to Fc receptors and consequently 
eliminates detectable Fc-effector functions and depletion of cells expressing PD-L1 at expected 
concentrations in humans. Orthogonal physicochemical methods were developed to characterise 
atezolizumab attributes and product variants. These methods include control system release assays 
that were validated following ICH guidance and extended characterisation. 
Summary of biological and immunochemical characteristics 
A number of in vitro assays were developed to reflect the proposed mode of action for atezolizumab.  
Additionally, assays to assess effector function and evaluate the binding of atezolizumab to FcRn were 
developed. These assays were used to assess the bioactivity of the active substance batches and to 
characterise the product, product variants, and stress samples. The suitability of these methods were 
either validated following ICH guidance or qualified for their intended purposes. 
Summary of CQA assessment 
CQAs identified for atezolizumab are divided into the following categories: product variants, process-
related impurities and obligatory CQAs. A CQA cut off score was determined by applying a CQA RRF 
tool to several examples of known high- and known low-risk quality attributes and establishing that the 
risk scores of known high-risk attributes were above the cut off. Quality attributes with moderate, 
high, and very high impact assessments will remain CQAs; reduced uncertainty will not move such 
attributes into the low-risk attribute category without corresponding low impact scores. 
The CQA acceptance criteria (CQA-AC) corresponds to the limit each CQA must meet throughout the 
finished product shelf life, independent of whether the CQA is routinely tested, tested through 
monitoring, or not tested. To meet the CQA-AC, restrictions have been included in the specifications of 
the finished product (release) and active substance (release and stability) based on the knowledge 
acquired on the process and stability for atezolizumab. For CQAs that are critical for bioactivity or 
pharmacokinetics (PK), CQA-ACs are established to ensure that CQA levels stay within the cumulative 
impact ranges for bioactivity and PK. 
Specification 
The release specifications for atezolizumab active substance have been suitably justified and are 
supported by consistent data from multiple lots. The specifications contain test for pharmacopoeial 
methods as well as specific methods to ensure sufficient safety and quality with respect to identity, 
purity, potency and other general tests. 
Reference standard 
A two-tiered approach was established for the commercial Reference Standard whereby the primary 
Reference Standard will be used to qualify future Reference Standards. The secondary Reference 
Assessment report  
EMA/153102/2018  
Page 18/205 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Standard is used as the working Reference Standard for testing of the active substance and finished 
product in all assays requiring a Reference Standard. Qualification of the commercial Reference 
Standards was conducted by release testing and extensive characterisation. 
Stability 
A shelf life of 24 months at ≤ -200C is claimed for the active substance based on stability data obtained 
with four batches manufactured using the commercial manufacturing process and is supported by data 
from five representative batches manufactured using the clinical manufacturing process.. 
Batches obtained with the clinical manufacturing process are comparable and considered 
representative of the commercial process. The comparability exercise did not show any significant 
difference between batches manufactured by the clinical and commercial process. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Description and composition of the finished product 
Atezolizumab finished product is provided as a sterile, single-use, colorless to slightly yellow solution 
for intravenous infusion and does not contain preservatives. 
Each 20 mL vial contains 1200 mg of atezolizumab, a nominal fill volume of 20 mL, at a target pH of 
5.8. The finished product is formulated as 60 mg/mL atezolizumab in 20 mM histidine acetate, 120 mM 
sucrose, 0.04% (w/v) polysorbate 20, pH 5.8. 
The container closure system consists of a Type I glass vial sealed with a rubber stopper and crimped 
with an aluminium seal fitted with a plastic flip-off cap. 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The finished product for commercial use contains 60 mg/mL atezolizumab in histidine acetate, sucrose, 
and polysorbate 20. These excipients are commonly used in formulation of biotech products. The 
Applicant established a quality target product profile (QTPP) which describes the desired performance 
characteristics of the product’s requirements with respect to quality, efficacy, and patient safety. 
Elements of the QTPP include requirements from the target product profile, scientific and technical 
knowledge, legal requirements (e.g. pharmacopeias and guidelines published by Health Authorities or 
ICH), and intrinsic drug substance properties. The QTPP also influences evaluation of CQAs and drives 
active substance/finished product process and formulation development. 
Manufacturing process development 
During development the finished product manufacturing was transferred to a different site. The 
finished product manufacturing process at both sites remained the same with some facility fit 
adaptations. 
Container closure system 
The finished product container closure system consists of the following components: 
- 20 mL Type I glass vial (Ph. Eur.); 
- 20 mm fluororesin-laminated rubber stopper (Ph. Eur.); 
- Aluminium seal fitted with a plastic flip-off cap. 
Assessment report  
EMA/153102/2018  
Page 19/205 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The 20 mL glass vial size selected as the primary packaging of the finished product is pharmaceutical 
grade and meets pharmacopeial standards. The 20 mm fluororesin-laminated liquid-type rubber 
stopper meets pharmacopeial requirements for container closure. Compatibility of the vial and stopper 
with the finished product is demonstrated by the long-term finished product stability data. The 
container closure system has been validated by container closure integrity testing. In addition, the 
primary packaging components (vial and stopper) for the finished product were selected from standard 
components that have been implemented for numerous other commercial products manufactured by 
the Applicant. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture and process controls 
The finished product was developed using a QbD approach and used the same RRF tools to define 
CQA-ACs, CPPs and the control strategy. However, no design space is claimed for the finished product 
manufacturing process. 
The commercial manufacturing process consists of thawing active substance, bioburden reduction and 
sterile filtrations, aseptic filling into glass vials, stoppering, capping and crimping, and visual 
inspection, including vial integrity testing.  
In-process controls composed of action limits and acceptance criteria for manufacture of the finished 
product are in place. 
Process validation 
The finished product process validation was performed on batches manufactured with the commercial 
process at the commercial site. 
Product specification 
The finished product specification includes pharmacopoeial methods as well as specific methods for 
control of identity, purity, potency. 
The control strategy for the finished product was developed using an approach similar to that used for 
the active substance. 
The Reference Standard used for finished product release and stability testing is the same as that used 
for the active substance 
Stability of the product 
The finished product stability claim of 24 months at 2-80C is based on primary stability data from three 
primary stability product Batches, which are considered representative of the commercial product. 
Commercial batches have been included in the stability program and will be monitored up to 48 
months in a long-term study. Also, one commercial batch will be added to the stability program 
annually if commercial production occurs during the calendar year. 
The compatibility/in-use study demonstrated that the finished product diluted solutions were 
physicochemically stable for 24 hours at 2-80C and 8hours at 300C in ambient room light conditions. 
Adventitious agents 
The risk of transmitting adventitious agents to humans, including transmissible spongiform 
encephalopathy (TSE), is thoroughly managed through the combination of control of raw and starting 
materials, process controls, and process understanding. 
Assessment report  
EMA/153102/2018  
Page 20/205 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There are no raw materials of human origin in the entire process. Raw materials of animal origin that 
are used in the commercial manufacturing process include recombinant human insulin and simethicone 
emulsion. Heat treatment, irradiation, and filtration of animal-derived raw materials, together with 
filtration and/or heat treatment steps, ensure control of non-viral and viral adventitious agents. All 
other raw materials used in the cell culture and purification process are not of animal or recombinant 
origin and are therefore safe with regard to contamination with agents causing TSE. 
All cell banks have been tested for non-viral and viral adventitious agents according to ICH Q5A and 
were found to be free of detectable adventitious viruses, as well as bacterial, fungal, and mycoplasma 
contamination. Results of routine testing of the active substance demonstrate that all batches 
produced are free from mycoplasma and within the acceptable limits set for bioburden and endotoxins. 
The process characterisation studies used to establish the design space includes the evaluation of four 
steps with regards to virus clearance and inactivation.  
Through systematic controls and comprehensive testing, as well as through the demonstration of 
clearance/inactivation included when moving within the design space, it can be ensured that the 
atezolizumab manufacturing process is safe with regard to potential viral and non-viral adventitious 
agent contamination. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
No Major Objection has been identified. The data presented on the chemical, pharmaceutical and 
biological aspects is very detailed and of high quality. Relevant guidelines and monographs have been 
taken into account. The development of the manufacturing process and the control strategy is based 
on a QbD approach and is generally considered properly described and justified. The dossier includes a 
post-approval lifecycle management (PALM) plan as well as Established Conditions. 
Critical process parameters (CPPs) are identified based on impact to critical quality attributes (CQAs). 
The process parameter classification and the defined ranges are acceptable and supported by process 
evaluation and/or validation.  
The Applicant demonstrated that due to the amino acid substitution atezolizumab has minimal binding 
to Fc receptors and consequently no detectable Fc-effector functions such as ADCC or CDC 
The commercial specification for the active substance for release and end-of-shelf-life are provided and 
based on the proposed control strategy. 
Stability data were provided to support the proposed shelf lives for active substance and finished 
product. 
Established conditions 
The Applicant has proposed Established Conditions (ECs) according to the draft ICH Q12 guidance on 
“Technical and Regulatory Considerations for Pharmaceutical Product Lifecycle Management”. The 
proposed definition of ECs is that they are legally binding information defined in a Marketing 
Authorisation Application. As a consequence, any change to an EC initiates a variation. Any change to a 
non-established condition does not require regulatory action. The proposed ECs represent the final 
outcome of many supportive activities such as validation, risk mitigation, characterisation, etc.  
Overall the attempt of the Applicant is very much appreciated and might trigger further discussion 
regarding product lifecycle management and dossier content. However, until the ICH Q12 discussions 
Assessment report  
EMA/153102/2018  
Page 21/205 
 
 
 
 
 
 
are finalised and a consensus is reached, the Applicant was asked to remove the reference to 
Established Conditions from the Module 3.2.R of the dossier. This request has been met. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Overall, the quality of Tecentriq is considered to be in line with the quality of other approved 
monoclonal antibodies. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
documentation comply with existing guidelines. The fermentation and purification of the active 
substance are adequately described, controlled and validated. The active substance is well 
characterised with regard to its physicochemical and biological characteristics, using state-of-the-art 
methods, and appropriate specifications are set. The manufacturing process of the finished product has 
been satisfactorily described and validated. The quality of the finished product is controlled by 
adequate test methods and specifications. 
Viral safety and the safety concerning other adventitious agents including TSE have been sufficiently 
assured. 
The overall quality of Tecentriq is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Expression of programmed deathligand 1 (PD-L1) is prevalent in many human tumours (Dong et al. 
2002), and its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis for patients with any of several 
epithelial cancers (Thompson et al. 2006; Hamanishi et al. 2007; Okazaki and Honjo 2007; Hino et al. 
2010).  Elevated expression of PD-L1 on tumour cells has been reported to impede anti-tumour 
immunity, resulting in immune evasion by tumour cells.  PD-L1 is one of two ligands that regulate the 
activity of programmed cell death1 (PD-1), an inhibitory receptor that modulates T-cell signalling and 
whose expression is induced on T cells following activation and sustained in sites of chronic stimulation 
such as the tumour microenvironment (Blank and Mackensen 2007).  Ligation of PD-1 impairs the 
capacity of chronically activated T cells to proliferate, produce cytokines, or effectively kill target cells 
in response to their cognate antigen.  Atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 
(IgG1) monoclonal antibody (mAb) that targets PD-L1 and inhibits its interaction with PD-1.  
Atezolizumab was engineered with an amino acid substitution at position 298, resulting in a non-
glycosylated antibody, to impair Fc receptor binding and to prevent Fc-mediated depletion of cells 
expressing PD-L1.

Binding of Atezolizumab to FcRs (Study 09-0426) 
The ability of atezolizumab to bind to human Fc receptors was assessed using a panel of in vitro 
ELISAs.  Atezolizumab exhibited minimal binding to each of the human Fc receptors tested (as shown 
in representative binding curves in Figure 1and Figure 2), relative to the humanized IgG1 control, 
trastuzumab, which bound to all Fc receptors tested.

In vivo tumour studies 
Evaluation of the Antitumor Efficacy of Anti-PD-L1 MAb in mice models (Studies 08 1033 E, 10 1883, 
Study 08-1734 D and 09-2165 I). 
The primary pharmacology of the mouse chimeric mAB derivative PRO314483 (atezolizumab PD-L1 
binding variable region set in a mouse IgG2a framework), also exhibit impaired Fc-mediated effector 
function) was studied in several syngeneic mouse models, in both colorectal tumours (MC38, 
MC38.OVA and CT 26) as well as one melanoma model (Cloudman S91). In the four studies, all treated 
groups showed improved average time to progression, and in MC38.OVA complete remission was 
observed in all treated animals with three weekly IP injections of 10 mg/kg PRO314483 for one up to 3 
weeks. In the study with melanoma (Cloudman S91), two (of 10) animals showed partial remission, 
however in all four studies tumour growth inhibition of 76% and above was observed.  
A summary of the designs and results from the in vivo tumour studies is provided in Table 5.

Evaluation  of  the  Impact  of  AntiPD-L1  in  a  Mouse  Model  of  LCMV  (Studies 08-0559A,  08-0559B, 
08-1160, 09-2500, 09-2500 B, 09-2501, 09-2501 A, 10-1394, and 08-1309 A) 
The objective of these studies was to evaluate the impact of atezolizumab in a mouse model of chronic 
viral infection (LCMV CL-13 model). 
When administered approx. 2 weeks after the initial infection, anti-PD-L1 treatment enhanced virus-
specific T cell function and reduced viral load without evidence of toxicity. Blockade of PD L1 at the 
peak of the acute T cell response and concomitant peak viremia following LCMV CL-13 infection (on 
Day 7) resulted in a mortality rate of 60%-100% (Study 08-0559B). Additional studies were conducted 
to determine the factors contributing to the enhanced disease and mortality in CL-13-infected mice 
following PD L1 blockade during peak viremia. 
The mortalities observed in the acute CL 13 infection model resulted from enhanced CD8+ T cell 
function in the setting of extremely high viral burden in multiple organs.  
Mortality with PD-L1 blockade was not seen in other acute viral infections that elicit robust T-cell 
responses and produce high viral titres with more restricted tissue tropism (e.g., Armstrong LCMV, 
vaccinia, and Adeno-5 virus) (Studies 09-2500, 09-2500 B, 09-2501, 09-2501 A, and 08-1309 A; 
Ha et al. 2008). 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No specific secondary pharmacodynamics studies have been conducted.

In vitro tissue cross reactivity studies were conducted with MPDL3280A using a full panel of human and 
Cynomolgus monkey tissues (see Study 08-1174).  In human tissues, biotin-MPDL3280Aspecific 
staining was detected in the placenta, lymph node, tonsil, and thymus.  Frequent, moderate, apical 
cytoplasmic and membranous staining was observed in syncytiotrophoblasts of the placenta.  Very 
rare, minimal to mild, cytoplasmic staining was observed in sinusoidal cells of lymph nodes and tonsil. 
Rare to frequent, mild to moderate, cytoplasmic staining was observed in thymic cortical and 
medullary cells. In Cynomolgus monkey tissues, biotin-MPDL3280Aspecific staining was detected only 
in the lymph node. Rare to frequent, minimal to moderate, cytoplasmic staining was observed in 
sinusoidal cells of lymph nodes. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No specific safety pharmacology studies have been conducted.  
Central nervous system, cardiovascular (telemetry and/or surface leads), and respiratory safety 
pharmacology parameters were evaluated as part of the 8- and 26-week GLP Cynomolgus monkey 
toxicology studies (Studies 08-1148 and 13-3278). No atezolizumab-related electrocardiographic 
findings were observed; all electrocardiograms evaluated in this study were qualitatively and 
quantitatively within normal limits. There were no changes in mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate, 
body temperature, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, or neurological parameters observed at doses 
up to 50 mg/kg given intravenously weekly for 26 weeks (total of 27 doses). 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies have been conducted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab was evaluated in a single-dose PK study in Cynomolgus 
monkeys. Repeat-dose toxicokinetics was assessed from the toxicity studies in Cynomolgus monkeys 
(8 and 26-weeks) and the exploratory toxicity study in mice (15 days). In addition, PK/PD of the 
chimeric anti-PD-L1 mAb PRO304397 was studied after single-dose administration in mice.   
Indirect antigen ELISAs were used for detection of atezolizumab or a chimeric anti-PD-L1 mAb in 
mouse and Cynomolgus serum. Bridging ELISAs were used for detection of anti-atezolizumab 
antibodies in mouse and Cynomolgus serum. All assays used in the pivotal Cynomolgus toxicity studies 
were adequately validated.  
In a PK/PD study in BALB/c mice, the PK of a chimeric anti-PD-L1 mAb and saturation of PD-L1 on 
peripheral blood T cells was evaluated after single IV doses from 1 to 30 mg/kg. The duration of PD-L1 
saturation on CD8+ and CD4+ T cells was dose-dependent and correlated with the amount of anti-PD-
L1 mAb in serum. 
Kinetics of atezolizumab in mice (C57BL/6 and CD1) was evaluated after 3 weekly IV doses of 10 and 
50 mg/kg. There was a dose-dependent increase in exposure after the first dose. However, 
atezolizumab serum concentrations dropped rapidly after the 3rd dose, which correlated with the 
presence of ATA in all mice after the 3rd dose. 
Assessment report  
EMA/153102/2018  
Page 28/205 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 6: Summary of non-clinical PK and TK studies 
Kinetics of atezolizumab in Cynomolgus monkeys were evaluated after single IV doses (up to 20 
mg/kg) and repeated IV and SC doses (up to 50 mg/kg). In all studies, a bi-phasic disposition was 
observed, with a rapid initial distribution phase followed by a slower elimination phase. The exposure 
was dose-proportional after the first dose in all dose groups, and in the mid- and high-dose group after 
the last dose.  
In the chronic toxicity study, after repeated once weekly administration, there was moderate 
accumulation of atezolizumab consistent with a half-life of 11.8 – 23.5 days. Bioavailability after SC 
administration ranged from 51.8 to 54.3%. In all studies the majority of Cynomolgus monkeys 
developed ATA, with a greater incidence in the low-dose group than in the high-dose group. In a 
number of animals, a decrease in atezolizumab serum concentration was evident after detection of 
ATA; this was most evident in the low-dose group.  
Studies on distribution, metabolism and excretion were not conducted.  
Non-clinical PK drug interaction studies were not conducted. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Toxicity of atezolizumab was evaluated in mice and Cynomolgus monkeys. Both species can be 
considered relevant for testing of atezolizumab. The toxicity programme consisted of a 2-week non-
GLP pilot study in mice, and 8-week and 26-week pivotal toxicity studies in Cynomolgus monkeys. In 
Assessment report  
EMA/153102/2018

Cynomolgus, the studies consisted of 3 dose groups in addition to a vehicle group; recovery animals 
were included in all dose groups. Local tolerance and immunotoxicity endpoints were evaluated as part 
of the repeat-dose studies. In addition, an in vitro cytokine release assay, a haemolytic potential and 
blood compatibility assay and a GLP tissue cross-reactivity study with human and Cynomolgus tissue 
was conducted. 
Single dose toxicity 
No single-dose toxicity studies were performed.

Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies were performed. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were performed. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were performed. 
Female and male reproductive organ systems were assessed as part of the chronic toxicity study 
(Study 13-3278, 26-Week Toxicity study in Cynomulgus monkeys). In females, menstrual cycles were 
monitored by daily vaginal swabs. An effect was observed on menstrual cycles at 50 mg/kg, with an 
irregular cycle pattern during the dosing phase with disturbed cycles especially between Weeks 8 and 
14. This finding correlated with an absence of fresh corpora lutea in the ovaries (lack of cycling 
activity) at the time of the terminal phase necropsy. This effect showed reversibility as the two females 
(from the recovery period) at 50 mg/kg demonstrated a return to normal menstrual cycling by vaginal 
swab data, and both animals had fresh corpus lutea at the recovery necropsy.  
In males, semen assessments, testicular evaluations, and serum testosterone level measurements 
were performed; there was no effect of atezolizumab on any of these parameters. 
Toxicokinetic data 
The toxicokinetics of atezolizumab were investigated in the repeat-dose toxicity studies 08-1148 and 
13-3278. 
Exposure to atezolizumab increased with the increase in dose level from 5 to 50 mg/kg.

Local Tolerance  
A separate local tolerance study of atezolizumab was not performed, as injection sites were examined 
macroscopically and microscopically as part of the 8- and 26-week repeat-dose Cynomolgus monkey 
toxicology studies (Studies 08-1148 and 13-3278, respectively). In Study 08-1148, a microscopic 
change related to the SC administration of atezolizumab was noted at terminal necropsy in 3 of 6 and 
6 of 6 animals given 15 and 50 mg/kg atezolizumab, respectively. The lesion was characterised as a 
minimal, focal to multifocal, and often perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrate in the SC tissue of 
injection sites. 
Other toxicity studies 
 
In Vitro Cytokine Release 
Study 08-1827: In Vitro Cytokine Release Study with Anti–PD-L1 Antibody in Human PBMCs  
The potential of atezolizumab to induce cytokine release from PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear 
cells) was evaluated in vitro. Isolated human PBMCs were cultured in the presence of solution-phase 
(soluble) or plate-bound (immobilised) atezolizumab at various concentrations (0.25-250 µg/mL) for 
24 or 48 hours, and supernatants were analysed for the presence of several cytokines and 
chemokines.   
Atezolizumab, over a concentration range of 0.25-250 µg/mL, did not induce cytokine release from 
isolated human PBMCs. The levels of GM-CSF, TNF-α, IL-8, IL-2, IFN-γ, IL-6, IL-1β, IL-10, IL-4, and 
IL-12 produced by PBMCs cultured with soluble or immobilized atezolizumab were comparable to those 
from PBMCs cultured in media alone or in the presence of the negative control antibody (anti-FGFR3) 
at both 24 and 48 hours.  
  Haemolytic Potential 
Study 08-1172: Haemolytic Potential Testing with atezolizumab in Cynomolgus Monkey and Human 
Blood  
Atezolizumab, at concentrations up to 125 mg/mL (the highest testable concentration), did not cause 
haemolysis of human or cynomolgus monkey erythrocytes. 
 
Tissue Cross-Reactivity study 
Tissue Cross-Reactivity of atezolizumab with Human and Cynomolgus Monkey Tissues Ex Vivo (Study 
08-1174) 
The cross-reactivity of biotinylated atezolizumab at concentrations of 0.25 and 1.25 µg/mL was 
evaluated immunohistochemically with cryosections of normal human and Cynomolgus monkey 
tissues.  
In human tissues, biotin-atezolizumab-specific staining was detected in the placenta, lymph node, 
tonsil, and thymus. Frequent, moderate, apical cytoplasmic and membranous staining was observed in 
syncytiotrophoblasts of the placenta. Very rare, minimal to mild, cytoplasmic staining was observed in 
sinusoidal cells of lymph nodes and tonsil. Rare to frequent, mild to moderate, cytoplasmic staining 
was observed in thymic cortical and medullary cells. 
In Cynomolgus monkey tissues, biotin-atezolizumab-specific staining was detected only in the lymph 
node. Rare to frequent, minimal to moderate cytoplasmic staining was observed in sinusoidal cells of 
lymph nodes.

therapeutic antibody (ATA) was investigated in studies 08-0806, 08-0598, 08-1148 and 13-3278.  
In study 08-0806, ATAs were detected in all animals 3 days after the last dose and through the end of 
the study. 
In study 08-0598, ATAs were observed post-dose in all animals given 0.5 mg/kg atezolizumab, all 
animals given 5 mg/kg atezolizumab, and all animals given 20 mg/kg atezolizumab at Day 14. All but 
one animal (in the 20 mg/kg group) remained ATA positive until the end of the study. 
In study 08-1148, 50 of 56 (89%) Cynomolgus monkeys dosed with atezolizumab developed ATA 
responses. Of these 50 ATA-positive Cynomolgus monkeys dosed with atezolizumab, 25 were female 
and 25 were male. 
Table 10: Non-compartmental PK parameter estimates (mean±SD) comparing ATA-positive and ATA-
negative Cynomolgus monkeys following nine weekly doses of atezolizumab (study 08-1148) 
In study 13-3278, ATAs were detected in 9 of 10 animals in the 5 mg/kg dose group, in 9 of 10 
animals in the 15 mg/kg dose group, and in 6 of 10 animals in the 50 mg/kg dose group (overall 
incidence of 80%). In general, there was a decrease in serum concentrations following detection of 
ATAs more particularly in the low dose group of 5 mg/kg. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Atezolizumab is a protein, which is expected to biodegrade in the environment and not be a significant 
risk to the environment. Thus, according to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of 
Medicinal Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), atezolizumab is exempt from 
preparation of an Environmental Risk Assessment as the product and excipients do not pose a 
significant risk to the environment.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Non-clinical in vitro data were submitted to describe the pharmacological mode of action of 
atezolizumab. The studies provide information on binding affinity of atezolizumab to its target PD-L1 
and on the inhibition of the PD-L1/PD-1 interaction. Atezolizumab did not bind to recombinant PD-L2-
Fc, while clear binding was detected with recombinant PD-L1-Fc. The lack of Fc functionality due to 
removal of the N-glycosylation site was demonstrated, except for the effect on CDC.  
The in vivo effect of blocking PD-L1 was adequately evaluated in murine syngeneic tumour models 
using chimeric anti-PD-L1 mAbs. These studies demonstrate that treatment with anti-PD-L1 mediates 
an effective anti-tumour response and provide sufficient proof-of-concept.  
Secondary pharmacology studies and pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were not performed 
which is considered acceptable. 
The pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab was evaluated in a single-dose PK study in Cynomolgus 
monkeys. Repeat-dose toxicokinetics were assessed from the toxicity studies in Cynomolgus monkeys 
(8 and 26-weeks) and the exploratory toxicity study in mice (15 days). In addition, PK/PD of the 
chimeric anti-PD-L1 mAb PRO304397 was studied after single-dose administration in mice.   
Indirect antigen ELISAs were used for detection of atezolizumab or a chimeric anti-PD-L1 mAb in 
mouse and Cynomolgus serum. Bridging ELISAs were used for detection of anti-atezolizumab 
antibodies in mouse and Cynomolgus serum. All assays used in the pivotal Cynomolgus toxicity studies 
were adequately validated.  
In a PK/PD study in BALB/c mice, the PK of a chimeric anti-PD-L1 mAb and saturation of PD-L1 on 
peripheral blood T cells was evaluated after single IV doses from 1 to 30 mg/kg. The duration of PD-L1 
saturation on CD8+ and CD4+ T cells was dose-dependent and correlated with the amount of anti-PD-
L1 mAb in serum. 
PK of atezolizumab in mice (C57BL/6 and CD1) was evaluated after 3 weekly IV doses of 10 and 50 
mg/kg. There was a dose-dependent increase in exposure after the first dose. However, atezolizumab 
serum concentrations dropped rapidly after the 3rd dose, which correlated with the presence of ATA in 
all mice after the 3rd dose. Therefore, complete TK characteristics could not be determined.  
PK of atezolizumab in Cynomolgus monkeys were evaluated after single IV doses (up to 20 mg/kg) and 
repeated IV and SC doses (up to 50 mg/kg). In all studies, a bi-phasic disposition was observed, with a 
rapid initial distribution phase followed by a slower elimination phase. The exposure was dose-
proportional after the first dose in all dose groups, and in the mid- and high-dose group after the last 
dose. In the chronic toxicity study, after repeated once weekly administration, there was moderate 
accumulation of atezolizumab consistent with a half-life of 11.8 – 23.5 days. Bioavailability after SC 
administration ranged from 51.8 to 54.3%. In all studies the majority of Cynomolgus monkeys 
developed ATA, with a greater incidence in the low-dose group than in the high-dose group. In a 
number of animals, a decrease in atezolizumab serum concentration was evident after detection of 
ATA; this was most evident in the low-dose group.  
In accordance with ICH S6 (R1), studies on distribution, metabolism and excretion were not 
conducted.  
Non-clinical PK drug interaction studies were not performed. This is acceptable, as monoclonal 
antibodies are not substrates for by cytochrome P450 enzymes or drug transporters. Furthermore, a 
cytokine-CYP-based drug-drug interaction between atezolizumab and small molecules is not expected 
given that atezolizumab by itself did not induce cytokine-release in vitro.

To support the safety of atezolizumab, toxicity was evaluated in mice and Cynomolgus monkeys. Both 
species can be considered relevant for testing of atezolizumab.  The toxicology programme is in 
accordance with current guidance and is considered appropriate.  
Atezolizumab-related findings in the repeated dose toxicity studies were sciatic neuropathy in C57BL/6 
mice and arteritis/periarteritis in Cynomolgus monkeys. Both findings may be due to enhancement of 
an autoreactive immune-response in pre-disposed animals. The toxicity studies provide no margin to 
the exposure at the proposed clinical dose of atezolizumab.  
Genotoxicity studies have not been conducted, which is in accordance with ICH S6(R1). 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been conducted in accordance with ICH S6(R1) and ICH S9. 
Furthermore, due to its mechanism of action, atezolizumab is not expected to be associated with an 
increased carcinogenic risk. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with atezolizumab. 
However, in the chronic toxicity study in sexually mature monkeys, atezolizumab treatment at the 
high-dose resulted in irregular menstrual cycles and a lack of newly formed corpora lutea in the 
ovaries. The finding was reversible after termination of atezolizumab. Inhibition of the PD-L1/PD-1 
pathway, which is intended to modulate the immune system by increasing T cell responses and pro-
inflammatory signals, may disrupt the delicate balance between the normal endocrine-immune axis 
required for maintaining normal ovarian cycling. 
Animal studies have demonstrated that inhibition of the PD L1/PD 1 pathway can lead to immune 
related rejection of the developing foetus resulting in foetal death. Administration of atezolizumab 
could cause foetal harm, including embryo foetal lethality (see section 5.3 of the SmPC). 
A weight-of-evidence approach in accordance to ICH S6(R1) was applied to describe the potential risk 
of atezolizumab to human pregnancy, which is acceptable. Given the role of the PD-L1/PD-1 pathway 
in maintaining materno-foetal tolerance, treatment with atezolizumab during pregnancy may lead to 
abortion or still births. This risk is reflected in section 4.6 of the SmPC: “Women of childbearing 
potential have to use effective contraception during and for 5 months after treatment with 
atezolizumab” and “Embryofetal toxicity” has been added as an important potential risk. 
Local tolerance was evaluated as part of the 8-week the repeat-dose toxicity studies in Cynomolgus 
monkeys. Microscopic changes at the SC injections sites were reversible and are considered consistent 
with administration of a heterologous protein.  
Atezolizumab does not pose a significant risk to the environment considering that it is a protein which 
is expected to biodegrade in the environment. According to the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk 
Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), atezolizumab is 
exempt from preparation of an Environmental Risk Assessment which is considered acceptable.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data submitted are considered appropriate and supportive of the MA for atezolizumab.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic data was collected from adult cancer patients only. The clinical pharmacology data is 
based on data from six clinical studies in cancer patients - two Phase I Studies (PCD4989g and 
JO28944, various cancer types), two Phase II Studies BIRCH and POPLAR (NSCLC) one Phase II Study 
IMvigor 210 (UC) and one supporting Phase II study FIR (NSCLC). The dose proposed for atezolizumab 
monotherapy is 1200 mg 3qw administered intravenously. 
During the course of atezolizumab development, several manufacturing changes were introduced. Two 
formulations of atezolizumab (identified as F01 and F03) have been developed and used in clinical 
trials. In vitro results and atezolizumab population PK analysis support comparability of the 
atezolizumab drug substance and drug product materials. No patients have been exposed to the 
commercial drug product.  
Table 12: Drug substance manufacturing process versions and drug product formulation 
Bioanalytical methods 
An indirect sandwich ELISA method has been used for the determination of atezolizumab levels in 
human serum. The assay was validated and run at two different sites. Cross-validation met criteria for 
equivalence.  
The ATA analysis strategy used a tiered approach. ATAs to atezolizumab in human serum were 
detected using a validated screening assay.  
The Nab assay uses a ligand binding assay format based on the ability of ATA to block the inhibition 
between PD-1 and PD-L1 by added atezolizumab. The drug tolerance reported is extremely low.  
PK of atezolizumab 
Non-compartmental (NCA) and population pharmacokinetic (popPK) analyses were conducted to 
quantitatively describe the pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab in patients and to evaluate the effects of 
relevant covariates. 
Absorption 
Atezolizumab is administered intravenously. There have been no studies performed with other routes 
of administration. Bioequivalence between the different versions or formulations has not been 
investigated.  
Assessment report  
EMA/153102/2018  
Page 40/205 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
The mean volume of distribution after a single dose administration is small as observed for other IgG 
mAbs with large molecular weight. 
The population PK analysis describes a linear 2-compartiment PK model with first order elimination. 
Body weight and gender are significant covariates. A flat dose regimen is suggested, as exposure-
efficacy and exposure-safety did not demonstrate expectedly clinically meaningful changes. This should 
be further justified. 
PopPK analysis indicates that V1 is 3.28 L and Vss is 6.91 L in the typical patient. 
Elimination 
Atezolizumab is supposedly - as other therapeutic proteins - cleared through receptor mediated 
endocytosis and/or non-specific endocytosis followed by catabolism. No renal elimination is expected 
given the large molecular weight of monoclonal antibodies. No classical studies regarding metabolism 
or elimination have been performed.  
A population pharmacokinetic analysis indicates that the typical clearance of atezolizumab was 0.200 
L/day and the typical terminal t1/2 was 27 days. Atezolizumab pharmacokinetics was consistent with 
linear pharmacokinetics over a dose range of 1 to 20 mg/kg of atezolizumab, including the fixed 1200 
mg dose of atezolizumab. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
  Dose proportionality 
The geometric mean dose-normalized AUC0-21, Cmax and Cmin, respectively appeared similar across the 
dose range 1 mg/kg – 20 mg/kg including the 1200 mg fixed dose (equivalent to ~15 mg/kg), 
indicating dose proportional PK for cycle 1 = single dose. Atezolizumab exposure data at steady state 
are also dose proportional.  
Geometric mean accumulation ratios for Cmin and Cmax ranged from 2.07 to 2.39 and 1.21 to 1.41, 
respectively. This extent of accumulation is line with predictions for a drug with this range of estimated 
t1/2 dosed q3w.

receiving 1mg/kg or higher) 
Inter-Individual and Intra-Individual variability 
The inter-individual variability is moderate. The results from the popPK analysis suggest the 
unexplained inter-individual variability is moderate for CL (i.e., 29%), V1 (i.e., 18%), and V2 (i.e., 
34%).  Of note, these values are based on Phase I study data from cancer patients characterized by a 
wide tumour type range including data from 20% of each UC and NSCLC patients. Unexplained IIV for 
CL decreased from 41% to 29%, for V1 from 27% to 18%, V2 was lowered only by 2% by introducing 
covariates.   
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The population pharmacokinetics (popPK) of atezolizumab was assessed based on Phase I data from 
two clinical studies PCD4989g and JO28944. From these studies, pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab in 
serum was evaluated in 472 patients with 4563 samples including 88 NSCLC and 92 UC patients. A 2-
compartment model was established and evaluated on this data base. From these patients, 88 NSCLC 
and 92 UC patients were included in the analysis population. 
PK in UC and NSCLC Patients 
The Phase I population PK model was subsequently subject to external validation for each indication 
separately, with the use of PK data collected in the NSCLC Phase II Studies BIRCH, POPLAR, and FIR 
(from 920 patients (out of 938 treated, 98.1%) with 3894 samples) and the UC Phase II Study IMvigor 
210 (PK samples from 423 patients (out of 429 treated, 98.6%) with 1248 samples). In total, 5142 
samples for external validation were collected from 1393 patients (UC and NSCLC) that received 1200 
mg of atezolizumab q3w IV in Phase II studies. Diagnostic plots and model-based simulation up to 10 
cycles of PK exposure metrics for each patient group showed deviations from observed data (sparse 
sampling) and thus will lead to biased exposure-response-relationships. The target patient population 
(UC and NSCLC patients receiving 1200 mg fix) is weakly represented.

PopPK analysis 
The popPK of atezolizumab was assessed based on Phase I data from two clinical studies PCD4989g 
and JO28944. From these studies, pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab in serum was evaluated in 472 
patients with 4563 samples including 88 NSCLC and 92 UC patients. A 2-compartment model was 
established and evaluated on this data base. From these patients, 88 NSCLC and 92 UC patients were 
included in the analysis population. Only patients receiving doses of 1-20 mg/kg atezolizumab q3w, or 
the 1200 mg q3w fixed dose by receiving the Phase III formulation F03 (N=45), were included in the 
evaluation. 
The PopPK model described the PK of atezolizumab by a linear two-compartment model with first-order 
elimination. 
Overall, females have a moderately higher exposure compared to males. Patients with low albumin 
tend to have a lower exposure with a larger effect on Cmin,ss. Baseline tumour burden and positive ATA 
have a minor impact on exposure over the dose range investigated in this analysis (i.e., 1 to 20 mg/kg 
of atezolizumab q3w, or the fixed 1200 mg dose q3w). Overall no covariate effect induces more than 
30% change in exposure from the typical patient (the typical patient is a male without positive ATA, 
weighing 77 kg, with an albumin level of 40 g/L and a tumour burden of 63 mm) except for body 
weight when evaluated at the lowest extreme of weight (i.e., 10th percentile). Patients with body 
weight lower than 54 kg would have up to a 32%, 28%, 40% higher AUC,ss, Cmax,ss or Cmin,ss, 
respectively, than the typical patient. None of these covariate effects would be expected to result in a 
Cmin,ss that would be lower than a targeted serum concentration of 6 μg/mL. 
The following statistically significant parameter-covariate relationships were identified (i denotes a 
specific patient):  
BWT = body weight (kg); ALBU = albumin (g/L); tumour burden (mm); ATAG = anti-therapeutic 
antibody. 
Special populations 
Based on population PK and exposure-response analyses age (21-89 years), region, ethnicity, renal 
impairment, mild hepatic impairment, level of PD-L1 expression, or ECOG performance status have no 
effect on atezolizumab pharmacokinetics. Body weight, gender, positive ATA status, albumin levels and 
tumour burden have a statistically significant, effect on atezolizumab pharmacokinetics. A sensitivity 
analysis was performed to examine the influence of the statistically significant covariates on steady-
state exposure (AUCss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss) of atezolizumab (see below).

  Renal impairment 
No dedicated studies of atezolizumab have been conducted in patients with renal impairment. In the 
population pharmacokinetic analysis, the impact of the degree of renal impairment on atezolizumab CL 
was further assessed by categorizing patients with varying degrees of renal impairment into 4 
categories based on their estimated eGFR (Normal: eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, Mild: eGFR ≥ 60 and 
< 90 mL/min/1.73 m2, Moderate: eGFR ≥ 30 and <60 mL/min/1.73 m2, and Severe: eGFR <30 
mL/min/1.73 m2).

Only a few patients had severe renal impairment (eGFR 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73 m2; n8). The effect of 
severe renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab is unknown. 
  Hepatic impairment 
No dedicated studies of atezolizumab have been conducted in patients with hepatic impairment. In the 
population pharmacokinetic analysis, 401 patients (85%) had normal hepatic function and 71 patients 
(15%) mild hepatic impairment. No data are available in patients with either moderate or severe 
hepatic impairment. The comparison of atezolizumab CL normalised on other covariates significant in 
the model in the patients with different hepatic functions is presented in the table below.

categories (mean, 90% CI of the mean) 
 
Elderly 
No dedicated studies of atezolizumab have been conducted in elderly patients. The effect of age on the 
pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab was assessed in a population pharmacokinetic analysis. Age was not 
identified as a significant covariate influencing atezolizumab pharmacokinetics based on patients of age 
range of 21-89 years (n472), and median of 62 years of age. No clinically important difference was 
observed in the pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab among patients <65 years (n=274), patients 
between 65-75 years (n=152) and patients > 75 years (n=46)

  Gender 
In the popPK analysis, gender was identified as a statistically significant covariate on both V1 and V2, 
but not CL, based upon a dataset including 276 men (58.5%) and 196 women (41.5%).  The extent of 
the effect of gender on AUCss, Cmax,ss, and Cmin,ss was determined by a sensitivity analysis and 
compared to a typical patient with other covariates kept fixed with median values. Tumor type /patient 
population was not a significant covariate. 
  Race 
After adjusting for covariate effects in the final popPK model, race (Asian n = 17, Black n = 15, and 
White n = 375) was not a significant covariate on the pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab and had no 
clinical relevance to atezolizumab CL. 
  Weight 
Covariate analysis identified body weight as most statistically significant covariate on CL resulting in a 
deviation in AUC of + 32% or -21% at the 10%- and 90%-percentiles compared to the typical patient 
(77 kg). The analysis dataset included patients of weight range from 36.5 to 168 kg. Body weight 
ranges for the target patent populations were similarly wide (UC: 39.6-161.8 kg, NSCLC: 34.9-175.8 
kg). The popPK modelling suggests an exponent of 0.8 indicating that body-weight adjusted dosing 
would be more appropriate regarding similar exposure in all patients (Wang et al, 2009).  
 
Immunogenicity 
In patients who were positive for ATA, CL is estimated to be 16% higher than in patients without ATA. 
Positive ATAG did not result in more than a 19% change in AUC,ss, Cmax,ss or Cmin,ss from the typical 
patient. 
The effect of NAbs is unknown due to limited performance of the NAb assay.   
  Albumin and tumour burden 
Albumin and baseline tumour burden were also identified as statistically significant covariates on CL. 
None of these covariates resulted in more than 28% change in AUC,ss, Cmax,ss or Cmin,ss, when evaluated 
at extreme values compared to the typical patient. 
 
PD-L1 status and tumour type 
Atezolizumab PK was not affected by PD-L1 status (IC score or TC score) or tumour type. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No formal drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
See section 2.3.2 non-clinical pharmacology. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Atezolizumab (MPDL3280A) is a humanised immunoglobulin G1 monoclonal antibody consisting of two 
heavy chains (448 amino acids) and two light chains (214 amino acids) and is produced in Chinese 
Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. Atezolizumab was engineered to eliminate Fc-effector function via a single 
amino acid substitution (asparagine to alanine) at position 298 on the heavy chain, which results in a 
non-glycosylated antibody that has minimal binding to Fc receptors and, consequently, eliminates 
detectable Fc-effector function and depletion of cells expressing programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in 
humans. Atezolizumab targets human PD-L1 on tumor-infiltrating immune cells (ICs) and tumor cells 
(TCs), and inhibits its interaction with its receptors programmed death 1 (PD-1) and B7.1, both of 
which can provide inhibitory signals to T cells. Atezolizumab is being investigated as a potential 
therapy against various solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. 
No studies with biomarkers have been submitted.  
Atezolizumab is moderately immunogenic with overall treatment-emergent incidence of ATA to 
atezolizumab ranged from 16.7 to 54.1%. The ATAs do not seem to impact on efficacy, but the 
confidence intervals are wide and no firm conclusion can be drawn. Especially, data to evaluate the 
duration of response in patients positive and negative for ATAs are immature.

atezolizumab of 10 (n=29), 15 (n=227), 20 (n=129) mg/kg or 1200 mg (n=32) were included in the

proposed 1200 mg fixed-dose (equivalent to 15 mg/kg) q3w dosing regimen will occur.

No formal DDI studies have been conducted. 
A flat dose of atezolizumab 1200 mg 3qw is proposed and has been the administered dose in the 
clinical studies.  
For UC and NSCLC patients, PK exposure Cmax, Cmin and AUC at cycle 1 and AUC at steady-state 
(AUC,ss) was estimated with the Phase I population PK model. They were compared with the objective 
response rate (ORR) for exposure-efficacy analyses. 
Albeit not shown constantly statistically significant, there is a trend in higher ORR vs. higher AUCss for 
UC and NSCLC patients. AUC,ss was identified to be most sensitive to body weight. PK exposure was 
only moderately well predicted (external validation).  
Data collected in POPLAR Study (not PD-L1 selected) from NSCLC patients were analysed regarding 
efficacy endpoint Overall Survival (OS). A constantly increasing trend of OS with atezolizumab 
exposure AUC was observed with the lowest AUC,ss-tertile showed efficacy that was comparable to 
docetaxel therapy. 
For urothelial carcinoma, no statistically significant ER relationships were identified with objective 
response rate (ORR) following atezolizumab 1200 mg q3w. In conclusion, disease modelling suggested 
an increasing trend of overall survival (OS) with atezolizumab exposure following administration of 
atezolizumab 1200 mg q3w. 
The atezolizumab exposure-safety analysis was performed on all treated NSCLC patients in the Phase 1 
Study PCD4989g and in the Phase 2 Studies BIRCH, FIR and POPLAR. The data set comprised a total of 
1007 patients with exposure data (out of 1026 treated patients in the four studies, 98.1%). Those 
patients received atezolizumab 1, 10, 15 or 20 mg/kg q3w or 1200 mg q3w. Most of these patients 
received atezolizumab 1200 mg q3w (N = 920, 91.4%). Two main adverse events (AE) were

investigated: Grade ≥3 AE (AEG35) and AE of special interest (AESI; potential immune related AEs) 
with respective incidences of 123 (12.5%) and 187 (18.6%). 
A statistically significant exposure-safety relationship was identified for AESIs. It was a slight increase 
in the probability of AESIs (estimate [95% prediction interval]) from 0.18 (0.16, 0.21) to 0.22 (0.18, 
0.26) for patients with the median and 90th percentile of AUCss, respectively. This change in 
probability of AESIs is not expected to be clinically meaningful. No statistically significant increasing 
trends of AEG35 with atezolizumab exposure were identified. 
Overall, as exposure-response analysis indicated more benefit for patients with higher AUC,ss level 
while no exposure-safety relationship could be detected, a dose adjustment for patients with high body 
weight or being characterised by other AUC-predictive factors might result in an improved benefit-risk-
ratio for those patients. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab has been characterised in cancer patients mainly by a 
population PK model. The popPK model is primarily based on the Phase 1a dose escalation study 
PCD4989g, but validated and found against PK data from the clinical phase II studies. PK 
characteristics are consistent in patients with urothelial carcinoma and patients with NSCLC.  
The formulation of atezolizumab finished product as presented in this application is not the same as 
the one which has been used in the clinical studies. Comparability has been demonstrated at the 
quality level and the differences appear to be minor and does not impact the safety and efficacy of the 
product. No clinical relevance in PK, efficacy or safety is expected.  
The ATA screening assay appears to be capable of measuring only free ATA molecules in the sample, 
and not those already bound to atezolizumab. Drug tolerance level of 200 µg/mL relates to a relatively 
high detection level of ATA positive control antibody (500 ng/mL). Thus, the sensitivity of the 
screening assay in the presence of 200 µg/mL of atezolizumab is only moderate. Furthermore, Cmin,ss 
levels in cancer patients are not far below this drug tolerance level (e.g. 170 ± 52 µg/mL in BIRCH 
study). The Nab assay does not have sufficient drug tolerance. This allows the conclusion that the 
clinical results concerning neutralising ADA occurrence are at least in part invalid and incidence is 
considered underestimated. 
The applicant is currently developing a more tolerant assay and is expected to provide validation 
results of the improved Nab assay as soon as available. The CHMP recommends providing validation 
results for the improved NAb assay by Q2 2018. 
No dedicated clinical pharmacology studies have been conducted, which is acceptable.  
Pop PK analyses suggested a linear two-compartment disposition model with first-order elimination 
over a dose range of 1 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg of atezolizumab, including the fixed 1200 mg dose (45 
patients). The popPK model is well-described and externally validated for each indication showing 
consistent PK.     
The pharmacokinetic parameters of atezolizumab are as expected for an IgG monoclonal antibody; 
elimination is linear within the therapeutic dose range and though some degree of target mediated 
elimination is likely as tumour burden is a significant covariate for clearance, no saturation of 
elimination pathways is observed.  
Body weight was identified as a statistically significant covariate on both clearance and distribution 
with impact at extreme values on AUCss, Cmax and Cmin of up to 32 %, 28 % and 40 % respectively.

The impact of the other statistically significant covariates (gender, positive ATA, albumin, tumour 
burden) is limited.  Body weight, gender, positive ATA status, albumin levels and tumour burden have 
a statistically significant, but not clinically relevant effect on atezolizumab pharmacokinetics. No dose 
adjustments are recommended, this has been reflected in Section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
The limited and lacking experience in patient with renal and hepatic impairment has been reflected in 
section 5.2 of the SmPC. No clinically important differences in CL were found for patients with mild and 
moderate renal impairment, but only few patients with severe renal impairment has been investigated. 
Mild hepatic function impairment (bilirubin between 1–1.5 × ULN or AST > ULN and bilirubin ≤ ULN) 
did not affect CL compared to normal hepatic function, but no patients with moderate or severe hepatic 
impairment has been investigated. Hence, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or 
moderate renal impairment or for patients with mild hepatic impairment Section 4.2 of the SmPC). 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, no dose adjustment of Tecentriq is required in 
patients ≥ 65 years of age (see section 4.2 of the SmPC). 
No drug-drug-interaction studies have been conducted, and no DDIs related to drug metabolising 
enzymes are expected. There is, however, a risk of pharmacodynamics DDIs, especially with immune-
modulating drugs. These were also restricted as concomitant medication in the clinical studies. Hence, 
the following recommendation has been made in section 4.5 of the SmPC: “The use of systemic 
corticosteroids or immunosuppressants before starting atezolizumab should be avoided because of 
their potential interference with the pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy of atezolizumab. However, 
systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants can be used to treat immune-related adverse 
reactions after starting atezolizumab (see section 4.4)”. 
A dedicated dose-finding study has not been conducted. Exposure-efficacy and exposure-safety were 
assessed with data from the clinical studies, dosing: atezolizumab 1200 mg 3qw. There is an 
increasing trend for better efficacy for patients with UC (not significant) NSCLC (significant), but a 
statistically significant (but unlikely clinically relevant) increasing trend with Adverse Event of Special 
Interest (AESIs) was also seen for patients with NSCLC. 
The Phase I population PK model was subsequently subject to external validation for each indication 
separately, with the use of PK data collected in the NSCLC Phase II Studies BIRCH, POPLAR, and FIR 
(from 920 patients (out of 938 treated, 98.1%) with 3894 samples) and the UC Phase II Study IMvigor 
210 (PK samples from 423 patients (out of 429 treated, 98.6%) with 1248 samples). Diagnostic plots 
and model-based simulation up to 10 cycles of PK exposure metrics for each patient group showed 
deviations from observed data (sparse sampling) and thus will lead to biased exposure-response-
relationships.  
The incidence of ATA to atezolizumab ranged from 16.7-54.1 % and atezolizumab is moderately 
immunogenic. Results of additional investigations requested during the procedure are plausible with 
decreasing recovery as the ATA concentration is increased relative to the atezolizumab concentration. 
ATA interference was becoming visible at ATA surrogate concentrations > 50 µg/mL in samples 
containing 50 µg/mL atezolizumab.  
It is agreed that the surrogate ATA might not reflect the concentration, neutralising ability, and affinity 
of ATA in each ATA-positive patient sample. However, as the geometric mean of Cmin values of 
atezolizumab at steady state were > 160 µg/mL in the UC and NSCLC patient groups, the results are 
ensuring that for the majority of PK trough samples, no relevant ATA interference is expected. Hence, 
the applicant is expected to provide validation results for the improved NAb assay.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In conclusion, pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab has been characterised in cancer patients by means of 
a popPK model and PK parameters are as observed for other IgG monoclonal antibodies.  
Atezolizumab is moderately immunogenic. The impact of ATAs and NAbs on efficacy and safety is 
inconclusive.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
The CHMP recommends providing validation results for the improved NAb assay by Q2 2018. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
The atezolizumab fixed dose of 1200 mg was selected on the basis of both nonclinical studies and 
available clinical data from Study PCD4989g as described below. The target exposure for atezolizumab 
was projected on the basis of nonclinical tissue distribution data in tumour-bearing mice, target-
receptor occupancy in the tumour, the observed atezolizumab interim PK in humans, and other factors. 
The target trough concentration (Ctrough) was projected to be 6 µg/mL on the basis of several 
assumptions, including: 1) 95% tumour-receptor saturation needed for efficacy and 2) the tumour-
interstitial concentration to plasma ratio of 0.30 based on tissue distribution data in tumour-bearing 
mice. 
The atezolizumab dose was also informed by available clinical activity, safety, PK, and immunogenicity 
(ATA) data. Anti-tumour activity has been observed across doses from 1 mg/kg to 20 mg/kg. The 
maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of atezolizumab was not reached, and no dose limiting toxicities 
(DLTs) were observed at any dose in Study PCD4989g. Available preliminary PK data (0.03-20 mg/kg) 
from Study PCD4989g suggested that for doses ≥1 mg/kg, overall atezolizumab exhibits PK that were 
both linear and consistent with typical IgG1 antibodies. ATAs were observed in patients at all dose 
levels but were associated with changes in pharmacokinetics for several patients in only the lower dose 
cohorts (0.3, 1, and 3 mg/kg). No clear relationship between the development of ATAs and safety or 
efficacy has been observed. Available data suggested that the development of detectable ATAs did not 
appear to have a significant impact on the pharmacokinetics for doses from 10 to 20 mg/kg in most 
patients. Accordingly, patients dosed at the 10-, 15-, and 20-mg/kg dose levels maintained target 
trough levels of drug despite the detection of ATAs. Currently available PK and ATA data suggest that 
the 15-mg/kg atezolizumab q3w regimen (or fixed-dose equivalent) for Phase II and Phase III studies 
would be sufficient to maintain Cmin ≥6 µg/mL. This dose level was also considered appropriate to 
safeguard against both inter-patient variability and the possibility that development of ATAs could lead 
to sub-therapeutic levels of atezolizumab relative to the 10-mg/kg atezolizumab q3w regimen (or 
fixed-dose equivalent). Simulations did not suggest any clinically meaningful differences in exposure 
following a fixed dose or a dose adjusted for weight. On the basis of this analysis, a fixed dose of 1200 
mg was selected (equivalent to an average body weight-based dose of 15 mg/kg). Selection of an 
every-21-day dosing interval was supported by this preliminary PK evaluation and allowed for a 
convenient integration with common chemotherapeutic regimens.

Treatments 
OAK: 
Atezolizumab 
The dose level of atezolizumab tested was 1200 mg (equivalent to an average body weight-based dose 
of 15 mg/kg) administered by IV infusion q3w (21 [±3] days) until loss of clinical benefit or 
unacceptable toxicity. 
Docetaxel 
The starting dose of docetaxel was 75 mg/m2 q3w. Dose modifications were performed according to 
the locally approved label. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
To determine if atezolizumab treatment results in an improved overall survival (OS) compared with 
docetaxel treatment in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have progressed 
during or following a platinum-containing regimen. 
Secondary objectives: 
• To evaluate efficacy of atezolizumab compared with docetaxel with respect to anti-tumour effects as 
measured by progression free survival (PFS) per investigator using RECIST v1.1 
• To evaluate efficacy of atezolizumab compared with docetaxel with respect to anti-tumour effects as 
measured by objective response rate (ORR) per investigator using RECIST v1.1 
• To evaluate efficacy of atezolizumab compared with docetaxel with respect to anti-tumour effects as 
measured by duration of response (DOR) per RECIST v1.1 for responding patients 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint: OS 
Secondary Endpoints: PFS, ORR and DOR, assessed by investigators using RECIST v1.1 
PD-L1 assessment 
An IUO-labelled assay was used to assess PD-L1 expression status at baseline in tissue from patients. 
The PD-L1 IHC assay and scoring system was developed to measure PD-L1-specific signals on both TCs 
and ICs using the SP142 IHC assay. Four levels of IC expression (IC0, IC1, IC2, IC3) and four levels of 
TC expression (TC0, TC1, TC2, TC3) were determined. Any cut-off references are to a single TC or IC 
score (e.g., TC2 or IC2) whereas patient population references include all IHC subgroups captured by a 
particular cut-off (e.g., TC2/3 population is captured by selection at the TC2 cut-off and include 
patients with TC expression level of TC2 or TC3).

Tumour Measurements 
Table 25: Schedule of tumour assessments across studies OAK, BIRCH, POPLAR, FIR and PCD4989g 
Tumour response was evaluated by radiologic imaging (CT scans or MRI) according to RECIST v1.1 and 
modified RECIST in OAK, BIRCH, POPLAR and FIR. The same radiographic procedure was used to 
assess disease sites at screening and throughout the study. The same evaluator performed the 
assessments if possible to ensure internal consistency across visits. At the investigator’s discretion, CT 
scans were repeated at any time if PD was suspected. For subsequent tumour assessments, 
procedures for tumour assessment were performed as clinically indicated. Specifically in BIRCH, scans 
were submitted for central review to an IRF. 
Tumour Response Criteria 
All studies used RECIST v.1.1 criteria to assess tumour response. In addition, Modified RECIST criteria 
were used in studies OAK, BIRCH, POPLAR, and FIR to further characterize response patterns that may

result from cancer immunotherapies, such as atezolizumab, which can produce delayed responses even 
after apparent radiological progression.  
In PCD4989g, immune-related response criteria (irRC) were used in addition to RECIST v.1.1. 
Table 26: Definition of immune-related response criteria (irRC) 
Sample size 
OAK 
Study OAK initially planned to enroll 850 patients in an Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population in order to 
have approximately 255 PD-L1 IC2/3 patients and 425 PD-L1 tumour-Infiltrating Immune Cell 
(IC1)/2/3 patients. Based on the interim analysis of POPLAR (randomized Phase II study) and 
additional data from PCD4989 and FIR studies, the Sponsor subsequently modified the statistical 
analysis plans according to the pre-specified Modification Plan (see the SAP and the study protocol 
Version 4). As a result, the sample size of OAK was increased to approximately 1100 patients (up to a 
maximum of 1300) in order to ensure at least 
220 patients with PD-L1 TC3 or IC3 status, assuming a 20% prevalence of the TC3 or IC3 subgroup. 
The final enrollment in OAK was 1225 randomized patients. Later, the primary analysis of POPLAR 
showed that OS treatment benefit extended beyond the TC3 or IC3 subgroup to broader subgroups. 
Study design assumptions in OAK based on these POPLAR results led to a fully powered study for OS 
evaluation in an ITT population with fewer than 1225 patients. Therefore, as outlined in the study 
protocol and prior to unblinding of the data, the planned primary OS analysis in OAK was modified to 
be conducted on the Primary Population (PP) of the first randomized 850 ITT patients at the Primary 
Analysis Time. The OS secondary analysis for the Secondary Population of all 1225 randomized ITT 
patients will be conducted at the Secondary Analyses Time To control the type I error rate in the 
evaluation of OS in the primary and secondary populations, alpha was split between the ITT population

and the TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 subgroup of the PP first. The OS testing in the PP started with a 3% alpha 
(two-sided) in the ITT population and a 2% alpha (two-sided) in the TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 subgroup of 
the PP (i.e., first 850randomized ITT patients). If either of these two hypotheses was rejected, then 
the remaining alpha would be split between the ITT population and the TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 subgroup 
of the SP first; subsequently, the further remaining alpha would be spent on the TC2/3 or IC2/3 
subgroup in the SP of the 1225 ITT patients, and lastly, passed down to the TC3 or IC3 subgroup in 
the SP of the 1225 ITT patients. 
Figure 7: Type I error control plan (two-sided)  
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised to one of the two treatment arms occurred in a 1:1 ratio. Permuted-block 
randomization was applied to ensure a balanced assignment to each treatment arm. Randomization 
was stratified by the following factors: 
 
PD-L1 expression on ICs by IHC (four categories of expression: IC0, IC1, IC2, and IC3 
  Number of prior chemotherapy regimens (1, 2) 
  Histology (non-squamous, squamous) 
If possible, patients received their first dose of study treatment on the day of randomization. If this 
was not possible, the first dose was administered no later than 3 business days after randomization. 
Blinding (masking) 
OAK study was open-label. 
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy endpoint is the duration (in months) of OS defined as the difference in time from 
the date of randomization to the date of death due to any cause. Data for patients who were not 
reported as having died at the time of analysis were censored at the date they were last known to be 
alive. Patients who did not have post-baseline information were censored at the date of randomization 
plus 1 day. The OS analyses were performed for the PP at the PAT and results are presented in this 
primary CSR. OS analyses will be performed for the SP at the SAT and results will be presented in a 
separate report.

For the PP of the first 850 randomized ITT patients, the two treatment comparisons with respect to OS 
were based on a stratified log-rank test at the two-sided level of significance, which was determined 
from the testing procedure described in Figure 2. The stratification factors were those used during 
randomization (i.e., tumor PD-L1 status [four categories of PD-L1 IC expression] per IxRS, the number 
of prior lines of therapy [1, 2] per IxRS, and histology [non-squamous, squamous] per eCRFs). An 
unstratified analysis was performed for the IHC subpopulations with the exception of the co-primary 
IHC subpopulation. 
The null and alternative hypotheses for the OS analysis in the ITT population, as well as in the TC1/2/3 
or IC1/2/3 subgroup, can be phrased in terms of the survival functions SA(t) and SB(t) in Arm A 
(atezolizumab) and Arm B (docetaxel), respectively: H0: SA(t) =SB(t) versus H1: SA(t)≠ SB(t) Kaplan-
Meier methodology was used to estimate the median OS for each treatment arm and to construct 
survival curves for the visual description of the difference between the treatment arms. The 
Brookmeyer-Crowley methodology was used to construct the 95% CI for the median OS for each 
treatment arm (Brookmeyer and Crowley 1982). The HR, λA/λB, where λA and λB represent the 
hazard of death in Arm A (atezolizumab) and Arm B (docetaxel), respectively, was estimated using a 
stratified Cox regression model with the same stratification variables used in the stratified log-rank 
test, including 95% CIs.

a One patient randomized to docetaxel received atezolizumab. 
b One patient withdrew from treatment before receiving any dose of study drug, but did not withdraw from the study at the time of the 
clinical cutoff date. 
c Two additional deaths (1 docetaxel, 1 atezolizumab) were collected from public record for a total of 298 deaths in the docetaxel 
arm and 271 deaths in the atezolizumab arm.  These 2 patients are captured in the study discontinuation eCRF as “withdrawal by

Conduct of the study 
The protocol was amended five times. The key changes to the protocol are summarized below. 
Protocol Amendment 2 (Version 3) – 5 August 2014. 
In this amendment, the treatment duration for atezolizumab was modified to allow patients to be 
treated until patients are no longer experiencing clinical benefit; accordingly, the 16-cycle or 12-month 
initial treatment, follow-up, and re-treatment periods no longer apply. 
An exclusion criterion regarding known tumor PD-L1 expression status from other clinical trials was 
added to ensure a natural distribution of the prevalence of PD-L1 expression levels. 
Protocol Amendment 3 (Version 4) – 2 December 2014. 
Planned PD-L1 expression subgroups for analysis were amended to include PD-L1 expression on TCs in 
addition to ICs. The sample size was increased from 850 to 1100 patients to allow for testing patients 
with TC3 or IC3 as first step in the hierarchy. 
Protocol Amendment 4 (Version 5) – 6 October 2015. 
Implementation of more stringent approaches for the management of immune-mediated toxicity; 
therefore, the management of gastrointestinal, dermatologic, endocrine, pulmonary toxicity, 
hepatotoxicity, potential pancreatic or eye toxicity and other immune-mediated adverse events was 
updated. 
Protocol Amendment 5 (Version 6) – 28 January 2016. 
The study was resized to fully power for testing OS benefit in this TC3 or IC3 patients (1100 patients, 
up to 1300). 
Changes to Planned Analyses 
The primary analysis population for ORR was changed to include all randomized patients regardless of 
whether they had measureable disease at baseline. For exploratory purposes, additional descriptive 
statistics were produced to summarize study drug exposure and efficacy after PD in patients who 
received at least one dose of atezolizumab after their first PD. The incidence of AEs before and after PD 
was also examined in patients who received at least one dose of atezolizumab after their first PD. 
Protocol violations OAK 
A major study conduct deviation was reported in 16.5% of patients in the docetaxel arm vs. 19.8% of 
patients in the atezolizumab arm. The most common on-study protocol deviation was “other procedural 
deviation significant for safety and/or efficacy” (i.e., not related to prohibited medication or incorrect 
dose received), with similar incidence between the arms. 
The category of “other procedural deviation significant for safety and/or efficacy” specifically included: 
missing lab or tumor assessment, tumor assessment performed out of window, failure to report SAE 
within 24 hours, delay in obtaining signature for informed consent form amendment or to allow 
continuation of treatment after disease progression. In addition, 3 patients (0.7%) in the docetaxel 
arm versus 19 patients (4.5%) in the atezolizumab arm received “treatment beyond discontinuation 
criteria”; 2 patients in the docetaxel arm and 1 patient in the atezolizumab arm received a prohibited 
concomitant medication; 2 patients in the docetaxel arm had deviations in the category of “incorrect 
study treatment or wrong dose” and of these 1 patient who was randomized to the docetaxel arm 
received atezolizumab.

PD-L1 Expression Status 
The majority of patients were IC0 (51.5% docetaxel vs. 49.4% atezolizumab) or IC1 (33.4% vs. 
37.2%). TC levels were also balanced between treatment arms across all expression levels with the 
majority of patients being TC0 (69.6% vs. 69.2%). The combination of TC and IC PD-L1 expression 
levels showed that all subgroups were balanced between treatment arms, except the atezolizumab arm 
had a higher proportion of patients in the mutually exclusive subgroup of TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 excluding 
TC2/3 or IC2/3 (20.5% vs. 26.1%).

Primary endpoint (OS) 
All-comers 
The Primary analysis of the study was performed as of the clinical cutoff date of 7 July 2016, at which 
time 569 deaths had occurred in the ITT population (event/patient ratio 66.9%). 
Atezolizumab treatment resulted in prolongation in OS as compared to docetaxel. The stratified HR was 
0.73 (95% CI: 0.62, 0.87; stratified log-rank p-value = 0.0003). Patients in the ITT population had a 
median OS that was 4.2 months longer in the atezolizumab arm: 9.6 months (95% CI: 8.6, 11.2) in 
the docetaxel arm versus 13.8 months (95% CI: 11.8, 15.7) in the atezolizumab arm.

Treatment with atezolizumab resulted in prolonged survival. The HR is 0.73 (95% CI; 0.62, 0.87), p-
value = 0.0003. Median OS was prolonged 4.2 months in the atezolizumab. These results are not only 
statistically significant, but also clinically highly relevant in a patient population with a dismal 
prognosis. The data are considered mature, as more than 66% of the events had occurred at the time 
of the clinical cut-off date.

EORTC QLQ-LC13 - Time to deterioration (TTD) of lung cancer symptoms 
Prolonged time to deterioration of patient-reported pain in chest as measured by the EORTC QLQ-LC13 
was observed with atezolizumab compared to docetaxel (HR of 0.71, 95% CI: 0.49, 1.05; median not 
reached in either arm). The time to deterioration in other lung cancer symptoms (i.e. cough, dyspnoea, 
and arm/shoulder pain) as measured by the EORTC QLQ-LC13 was similar between atezolizumab and 
docetaxel.

Please refer to Figure 17: Patient disposition (3rd interim analysis – ITT population) - POPLAR. 
Treatments 
POPLAR: 
Atezolizumab 
The dose level of atezolizumab tested was 1200 mg (equivalent to an average body weight-based dose 
of 15 mg/kg) administered by IV infusion q3w (21 [±2] days) until loss of clinical benefit or 
unacceptable toxicity. 
Docetaxel 
The starting dose of docetaxel was 75 mg/m2 q3w. Dose modifications were performed according to 
the locally approved label. Treatment continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
Objectives 
Primary objective: 
To estimate the efficacy of atezolizumab compared with docetaxel as measured by OS 
Secondary objectives: 
To evaluate the efficacy of atezolizumab compared with docetaxel with respect to anti-tumour effects 
measured by overall response, DOR, and PFS per RECIST v1.1 
To evaluate the efficacy of atezolizumab with respect to anti-tumour effects measured by overall 
response, DOR, and PFS per modified RECIST 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint: OS. 
Secondary Endpoints: PFS, ORR, DOR: by RECIST v1.1 and mRECIST. 
Please refer to “Outcome/endpoints” of OAK study for further information regarding PD-L1 assessment, 
tumour measurements and tumour response criteria. 
Sample size 
This Phase II study was designed to provide an assessment of the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab 
and the primary purpose was the estimation of the OS and PFS hazard ratios in the PD-L1 expression 
subgroups and in the ITT population. The study was designed to enrol a minimum of approximately 54 
Assessment report  
EMA/153102/2018  
Page 78/205 
 
 
 
 
 
 
PD-L1 IC2 or IC3 patients. In the case that the PD-L1 IC2 or IC3 prevalence was lower than 18%, up 
to a maximum of 300 total patients could be enrolled. 
The study was expected to enrol 285 total patients and 55 PD-L1 IC2 or IC3 patients. These numbers 
were used for the statistical calculations described below. 
The power and 95% CIs for OS and PFS in the PD-L1 IC2 or IC3 subset were based on the following 
assumptions: Event times are exponentially distributed, median PFS in the control arm is 3 months, 
median OS in the control arm is 8 months, and patients are enrolled over 8 months. 
The power and 95% CIs for OS and PFS in the ITT population are based on the following assumptions: 
Event times are exponentially distributed, median PFS in the control arm is 3 months, median OS in 
the control arm is 8 months, and patients are enrolled over 8 months. Patients were followed until 
approximately 180 patient deaths in the ITT population occurred. 
Randomisation 
Randomization was stratified by tumour tissue PD-L1 expression on tumour-infiltrating immune cells 
(IC0, IC1, IC2, and IC3), number of prior lines of chemotherapy (1 versus 2) and histology (non-
squamous versus squamous). Randomization was conducted using an Interactive Web Response 
System (IWRS). 
Blinding (masking) 
POPLAR study was open-label. 
Statistical methods 
Three interim OS analyses were conducted when approximately 30, 100, and 150 events in the ITT 
population occurred. An α of 0.0001, 0.0001, and 0.001 was spent for the first, second, and third 
planned interim analysis of OS, respectively. The primary OS analysis was conducted at the 4.88% 
level of significance when approximately 180 events were observed in the ITT population. The testing 
hierarchy for OS started with the subgroup of TC2/3 or IC2/3 at the two-sided alfa-level of 4.88% and 
in the event that the null hypothesis was rejected, the test continued to the next subgroup at the same 
4.88% level of significance.

Results 
Participant flow 
Figure 17: Patient disposition (3rd interim analysis – ITT population) - POPLAR 
Of the 240 patients that failed screening, there were 130 patients who failed to meet protocol-defined 
inclusion criteria, 90 patients who met conditions for exclusion, and 20 patients who failed screening 
for other reasons unrelated to inclusion and exclusion criteria. This was primarily driven by insufficient 
tumour sample for pathology (47 patients); Inadequate hematologic and end organ function (31 
patients); and 56 patients with known active or untreated CNS metastases. 
Recruitment 
First patient randomized: 5 August 2013. Last patient randomized: 31 March 2014.  
61 centers in 13 countries: USA (26 centers), Poland (4), Germany (4), Spain (4), France (5), Korea 
(3), Thailand (3), Great Britain (4), Belgium (1), Turkey (2), Canada (2), Italy (2), Sweden (1). 
Conduct of the study 
The protocol was amended five times. The key changes to the protocol are summarized below. 
Protocol Amendment 2 (Version 3) – 30 January 2014. 
Protocol revised to reflect the continuation of enrollment of patients until a minimum of approximately 
54 patients PD-L1−positive were accrued.  In  the  case  that  the prevalence of PD-L1−positive patients 
was lower than 18%, up to a maximum of approximately 300 total patients could be enrolled. 
Assessment report  
EMA/153102/2018  
Page 80/205 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Protocol Amendment 3 (Version 4) – 21 May 2014. 
Treatment duration for atezolizumab was modified to allow patients to be treated until  clinical benefit 
was  no  longer  being  experienced;  accordingly,  the  16-cycle  or  12-month  initial  treatment,  follow-up, 
and  re-treatment  periods  no  longer  applied.  The  timing  of  the  interim  safety  and  efficacy  data 
evaluation by the Internal Monitoring Committee changed from when 30 and 60 deaths were observed 
to when approximately 30 and 100 deaths had occurred. 
Protocol Amendment 5 (Version 6) – 24 February 2015. 
Adjusted  the  event  threshold  for  the  primary  analysis  to  approximately  180  death  events  and 
converted  the  originally  planned  analysis  at  approximately  150  death  events  to  an  interim  analysis. 
Clarified  that  stratification  by  PD-L1  IHC  status  was  based  on  PD-L1  expression  on  tumor-infiltrating 
immune cells. In addition to the primary analyses on the  ITT population and the subgroup of patients 
with PD-L1 IHC 2 or IHC 3 expression status in ICs, the protocol was amended to allow for subgroup 
analyses  based  on  other  categories  of  PD-L1  expression  (e.g.,  including  expression  on  tumor  cells 
[TCs]).

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
In order to evaluate consistency of efficacy across the studies in this application, the following section 
presents side-by-side comparisons of baseline characteristics and key efficacy results from 2L+ NSCLC 
patients across all four studies. The populations of these studies are different with respect to patient 
selection by PD-L1 status, which needs to be taken into consideration when comparing the efficacy 
data.

  BIRCH (GO28754):  A Phase II, Multicenter, Single-Arm Study of MPDL3280A in 
Patients with PD-L1-Positive Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non-Small Cell Lung 
Cancer. 
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of atezolizumab in patients with PD-L1 selected 
patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC as measured by the Independent Review Facility 
(IRF)-assessed ORR according to RECIST v1.1. 
The primary endpoint was IRF-assessed ORR per RECIST v1.1. The key secondary endpoints included 
investigator (INV)- assessed ORR, DoR, PFS and TIR per RECIST v1.1 and per modified RECIST. IRF-
assessed DOR, PFS, TIR per RECIST v1.1; PFS rate at 6 months and 1 year; OS, OS rate at 6 months 
and 1 year. 
In BIRCH, the efficacy analysis of the primary efficacy outcome measure, comparison of ORRs to 
historic controls (per data available in 2013, Massarelli et al. 2003, Younes et al. 2011, Zietemann and 
Duell 2011), followed a hierarchical fixed sequence procedure. In each of the seven sub-populations, 
the IRF-assessed ORR according to RECIST v1.1 was sequentially tested at a two-sided alfa-level of 
0.05. The overall type I error rate was controlled at a two-sided alfa-level of 0.05. 
Study participants: 
For inclusion/exclusion criteria, please refer to Table 23. 
Treatment: 
The dose level of atezolizumab in this study was 1200 mg every 3 weeks (q3w) administered by IV 
infusion.

Baseline characteristics 
Patients in the study were predominantly male (59%) and White (83%). Asians accounted for 12% of 
the overall population. The median age of the study population was 64 years (range 28-88 years). The 
majority of patients had a history of tobacco use; 72% were previous smokers and 11% were current 
smokers. Approximately 64% had a baseline ECOG PS of 1. 
With respect to disease characteristics, the predominant histologic type was non-squamous NSCLC 
(72%), 33% had a KRAS mutation, 12% had an EGFR mutation, and 2% had EML4-ALK 
rearrangement

treated patients - BIRCH 
  FIR: A phase II, multicentre, single-arm study of atezolizumab in patients with PD-L1 
positive locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC. 
The main objective of the study was to assess the clinical activity of atezolizumab, as measured by the 
investigator-assessed ORR per modified RECIST, in patients with PD-L1-positive locally advanced or 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. 
The secondary objectives were to estimate the ORR based on investigator assessment per RECISTv1.1, 
to assess the DOR, to estimate the PFS and estimate the OS.  
Study participants: 
Study FIR enrolled patients with locally advanced and metastatic NSCLC with PD-L1 expressing tumors 
and measurable disease at baseline assessed per RECIST v1.1 and ECOG PS of 0 or 1. Disease was 
progressing since the last antitumor therapy. Patients had either not received prior chemotherapy for 
advanced disease (Cohort 1), or had progressed during or following a prior platinum-based 
chemotherapy regimen for advanced disease (2L+; Cohort 2) or were 2L+ and previously treated for 
brain metastases. 
Treatment: 
The dose level of atezolizumab in this study was 1200 mg every 3 weeks (q3w) administered by IV 
infusion.  
Assessment report  
EMA/153102/2018  
Page 100/205 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients remained on study treatment as long as they continued to experience clinical benefit (or 
occurrence of unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic deterioration attributed to radiographic PD). 
Analysis population: 
The analyses of ORR, PFS, OS have been performed on all treated patients, i.e., all patients who 
received any dose of atezolizumab during the study treatment period (efficacy-evaluable population). 
DOR and TTOR have been assessed in all treated patients with objective response (efficacy-evaluable 
population with objective response). 
Patient disposition: 
At the time of the data cutoff (7 January, 2015), a total of 28 patients (7 in Cohort 1, 21 in Cohort 2) 
were continuing to receive treatment with atezolizumab. All 13 patients in Cohort 3 had withdrawn 
from study treatment. The primary reason for discontinuation from treatment remained progression of 
disease (59,8% [82/137 patients]). 
Baseline characteristics: 
Baseline characteristics of patients enrolled in the study were representative of the general population 
of patients with advanced NSCLC. Patients in the study were predominantly male (57.7%) and White 
(89.1%). The median age of the study population was 66 years (range 42-85 years). The majority of 
patients had a history of tobacco use with 73.0% being previous smokers and 13% current smokers. 
Approximately 70% had a baseline ECOG PS of 1. The predominant histologic type was non-squamous 
NSCLC (72.3%). 
To support the claimed indication, an interim analysis of FIR study was provided.

In line with above mentioned study results higher PD-L1 expression was associated with higher ORR in 
the FIR study: the TC3 or IC3 subgroup had the highest ORR (26.3% per modified RECIST and 23.7% 
per RECIST v1.1 vs. 17.2% per modified RECIST and 16.1% per RECIST v1.1 in TC2/3 or IC2/3). 
Restrictions are the limited duration of follow-up and immature OS and DOR data.

  PCD4989G 
Study PCD4989g is an ongoing Phase Ia, multicenter, first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation 
study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and PK of atezolizumab administered as a single agent by IV 
infusion q3w to patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancies, including NSCLC. 
Study participants: 
Study PCD4989g NSCLC Cohort enrolled patients with locally advanced and metastatic or recurrent 
NSCLC, with measurable disease at baseline assessed per RECIST v1.1 and ECOG PS of 0 or 1. Disease 
was progressing since the last antitumor therapy. 
The initial recruitment of patients into this dose expansion cohort was based on high PD-L1 expression 
as assessed by IHC (i.e., IC2/3) status. Once an efficacy signal was observed, recruitment was 
expanded to an all IC status population. Later, in order to have a more precise estimate of the ORR in 
the IC2/3 subset, enrolment was again limited to IC2/3 status.  Due to the resultant enrichment of 
IC2/3 status, the prevalence of PD-L1 IC scores in the study population did not reflect the natural 
prevalence in patients with NSCLC. 
Treatment: 
Atezolizumab IV infusion q3w at ≤1mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 15 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg. Overall, 88 patients 
received a weight-based dosing.  
Patients remained on study treatment as long as they continued to experience clinical benefit (or 
occurrence of unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic deterioration attributed to radiographic PD). 
Analysis populations: 
The primary analysis population identified for the NSCLC indication was the safety-evaluable 
population, which comprised all enrolled patients who received any amount of atezolizumab (n = 88) 
as of 2 December 2014. Analyses of ORR were performed on the objective response (OR)-evaluable 
population (efficacy evaluable population [received dose of ≥ 1 mg/kg] with measurable disease per 
RECIST v1.1 at baseline for PCD4989g). 
Efficacy Endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint for NSCLC was confirmed ORR assessed by INV-RECIST v1.1. Secondary 
endpoints comprised BOR (unconfirmed), DOR, 6-month PFS, 1-year PFS per RECIST v1.1; and 1-year 
OS. Exploratory endpoints comprised PFS, TIR, PFS in responders; TTOR, per RECIST v1.1; and OS.) 
Patient disposition: 
At the time of the 7 August 2015 clinical data cutoff for the updated efficacy analysis, 89.8% of the 
patients in the NSCLC cohort (79/88patients) were no longer receiving atezolizumab. The primary 
reason for discontinuation from treatment remained disease progression (58.0% [51/88 patients], at 
the 2 December 2014 clinical data cut. 
Baseline characteristics: 
Baseline characteristics were also representative of patients with poor prognostic factors inclusive of 
ECOG PS of 1 (71.6% of patients), smokers (81%, current or previous), and heavily pretreated 
(56.8% had received ≥ 3 prior lines of therapy). Of those patients tested, EGFR mutations were 
documented in 10 of 64 patients, KRAS in 14 of 51 patients, and EML4-ALK translocations in 2 of 46 
patients.

Baseline characteristics are comparable between POPLAR and Study PCD4989g besides the number of 
prior systemic regimens in the metastatic setting. Patients in the Phase I trial were more heavily pre-
treated (98% of ≥2 lines compared to 35.4% in Cohort 2 of POPLAR). 
Efficacy results

Confirmed and unconfirmed response rates are increasing with the level of PD-L1 expression (TC3/IC3 
vs TC2/3/IC2/3 vs TC0/1/IC0)) compared to low PD-L1 expression across all analysis. Response was 
durable. The median DOR per investigator assessed RECIST v1.1 for the 20 responders was 17.3 
months (95% CI: [14.2, 24.7]), and 8 of the 20 responders continued to respond. The median DOR 
was similar across all PD-L1 expression subgroups:  14.6 months (TC3 or IC3), 17.3 months (TC2/3 or 
IC2/3). 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Two pivotal (BIRCH and POPLAR) and two supportive studies (FIR and PCD4989G) were initially 
provided in support of the sought indication (Atezolizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after prior 
chemotherapy). During the procedure the primary results from the OAK study were also provided and 
assessed. The proposed posology is 1200 mg administered by IV infusion q3w. Treatment should be 
continued as long as clinical benefit is observed or until treatment is no longer tolerated by the patient. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The BIRCH and FIR study included PD-L1 selected patients across a range of lines (1L, 2L, 3L+), while 
the OAK, POPLAR and FIR study enrolled patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease that had 
progressed during or following a platinum-containing regimen, regardless of their PD-L1 expression. 
Furthermore, patients with EGFR mutation and ALK oncogene were also included.  
Assessment report  
EMA/153102/2018  
Page 103/205 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The BIRCH and FIR were single-arm studies with ORR as primary endpoint. ORR is a suitable endpoint 
for single-arm studies, and can be assessed earlier, compared to other endpoint, e.g. OS and PFS. 
Also, the observed effect is directly associated to the investigated drug.  
The OAK and POPLAR studies are a two-arm, open-label, randomised phase III and II studies 
respectively. Primary endpoint is OS in both studies. Few and clinically meaningful stratification factors 
have been applied. This is endorsed. Docetaxel is an adequate comparator for second line treatment, 
the open-label design is considered acceptable with regard to overall survival as primary endpoint. 
In the OAK study, it seems that about 50 % of the patients were ALK mutation positive. A proportion 
of less than 5 % would rather be expected (as observed in POPLAR, BIRCH, FIR and PCD4989g). The 
Applicant is asked to clarify. 
The Applicant has used “permuted-block randomization”. Despite large and randomly varied block 
sizes, this randomization procedure can still lead to bias, if the number of patients is small, thus, 
leading to imbalance in factors that are not included in the stratification. However, since the most 
important clinical factors are included in the stratification, there are no major concerns about the use 
of permuted-block randomization in the POPLAR and OAK studies. 
The Applicant has included several secondary and efficacy endpoints in the pivotal studies, including 
“biomarker analyses” and PRO data. 
Immune checkpoint inhibitors may require additional time to confirm a measurable or clinical effects 
compared with traditional cytotoxic chemotherapy (Chiou et al. 2015, JCO). In order to avoid cases of 
pseudo-progression, which is a recognized problem with PD-L1 check point inhibitors, the Applicant has 
implemented modified RECIST criteria. This is endorsed. A consecutive assessment is conducted ≥ 4 
weeks from the date first documented. This consecutive assessment should be able to detect cases of 
pseudo-progression. 
The Applicant has based the pre-specified historical control rate (BIRCH study) on previously published 
studies in 1L and 2L as seen in the below table. The Applicant clarifies that the wording of “5% to 
30%” in the study protocol refers to an increase from 5% (assumed historical control rate in the 3L 
setting which can be as low as 2%) (Massarelli et al. 2003) to 30% (expected ORR with the treatment 
of atezolizumab) and not to the range of the historical control rate. A large number of patients (3914) 
were screened for PD-L1 status, but only 967 were screened for study and 667 patients were included 
and the Applicant was asked to clarify the apparent large difference in patients screened for PD-L1 
status and the actual number of patients screened for study. The reason for the large pre-screen 
failure rate (56%) was mostly due to negative or non-evaluable PD-L1 status and no tissue provided. 
The screen failure of 300 patients were primarily driven by the following: PD-L1 status not confirmed, 
brain metastases, in- and exclusion criteria not met. These reasons are understandable and acceptable 
in the context of the targeted patient population The Applicant changed the planned analyses, and did 
not generate waterfall plots showing the best change in SLD. However, these data were provided upon 
request and the waterfall plots show that the treatment of atezolizumab is active in many patients and 
even a few CRs were observed. The inclusion/excl. criteria and thus the included patient population 
support the sought indication. 
In the OAK study, the primary analysis was planned (according to SAP v2) when in the PP population, 
595 deaths have occurred. This is, however, not in line with the actual timing of the analysis which was 
conducted after 569 events, i.e., 26 events earlier than the pre-planned timing. Additional analysis 
(based on 595 events) did not indicate a major impact of the early stopping on study results. 
Assessment report  
EMA/153102/2018  
Page 104/205 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Protocol GO28915 (V6) was amended for the final statistical analysis strategy on 28.01.2016 when all 
patients were already randomized following an amended SAP (V2) dated 10.12.2015. The additional 
analysis for the ITT population of the first 850 randomized patients with a data cutoff per 10 Dec 2015 
did not reveal a relevant difference to the primary analysis provided in the CSR. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Response rates in the range of 17% to 27% are observed in cohort 2 and 3 (2L and 3L respectively) in 
the BIRCH study. Compared to historical control rates, the results are statistically highly significant. 
However, it is not evident, how the Applicant has determined to the historical response rates in the 
different TC and IC subgroups. The Applicant was asked to clarify. 
The pivotal study OAK showed a median OS for atezolizumab of 13.8 months vs. 9.6 months for 
docetaxel and a HR of 0.73  (95%CI: 0.62, 0.87, p<0.0003) for the overall population. 
The study POPLAR showed a median OS for atezolizumab of 12.6 months vs. 9.7 months for docetaxel 
and a HR of 0.73  (95%CI: 0.56, 0.80, p<0.0404) for the overall population. 
In the POPLAR study, the subgroup analysis show consistent results across most subgroups. This is 
reassuring. It is noted that the effect of atezolizumab seems to be independent of sex, age and ECOG, 
but the effect seems to be comparable to docetaxel in the subgroup of patients that have received one 
prior line of therapy compared to patients having received 2 prior lines of therapy. Updated analyses 
confirm, similar to the primary analysis, that only patients in the atezolizumab arm with one prior 
therapy had improved survival over those in the docetaxel arm (unstratified HR of 0.56, 95% CI: 0.39, 
0.79). OS benefit was not significant for patients with two prior therapies, but the study is not powered 
for this subgroup analysis, hence, this result may not be valid and should not be reflected in the 
approved indication. Also, the effect of atezolizumab seems to be higher in non-squamous in the 
primary analysis. The HR in the squamous subgroup is 0.8, but the 95%CI (0.49, 1.30) is wide as 
result of low number of patients in this subgroup. However, the updated analyses (cut-off 1. Dec 2015) 
of OS by histology shows that the HR has improved to 0.66 (95%CI; 0.41, 1.05).  
In the OAK study, both squamous and non-squamous histology subgroups, the TC3 or IC3, TC2/3 or 
IC2/3, TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3, and TC0 and IC0 subgroups treated with atezolizumab showed OS 
improvement compared with patients treated with docetaxel. Across all PD-L1 expression subgroups 
defined by different TC or IC cutoffs, the point estimates of the HRs for OS were equal to or below 
0.82.  
Nonetheless, when taking into account the TCO/IC0 subgroup the visual inspection of OS survival 
curves shows a separation of the curves beyond 3 months with a trend to further increased differences 
at subsequent time points.  Thus, it was considered that the data were still immature and the Applicant 
was asked to present updated data for better understanding of the time dependent effect. The OS 
results at the update were similar to those from the primary analysis. 
Antibodies (ATA) 
Key  efficacy  endpoints,  including  ORR  and  DOR  in  all  four  studies  and  OS  and  PFS  in  POPLAR,  were 
also  analyzed  in  relation  to  ATA  status  (data  not  shown).  Overall,  there  was  no  clinically  relevant 
impact of ATA on efficacy. 
HRQoL 
Prolonged time to deterioration of patient reported pain in chest as measured by the EORTC QLQ LC13 
was observed with atezolizumab compared to docetaxel in the OAK study. The time to deterioration in 
Assessment report

other  lung  cancer  symptoms  (i.e.  cough,  dyspnoea,  and  arm/shoulder  pain)  as  measured  by  the 
EORTC QLQ LC13 was similar between atezolizumab and docetaxel. These results should be interpreted 
with caution due to the open-label design of the study. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy (NSCLC) 
Taken together the overall results of the OAK and POPLAR studies have demonstrated clinically 
meaningful improvement of OS compared to docetaxel in adult patients with advanced NSCLC who 
have disease progression on or after prior chemotherapy. These results are further supported by 
supportive studies. The effect of atezolizumab appears dependent on PD-L1 expression level, histology 
and the number of prior therapies. 
2.6.  Clinical efficacy – Urothelial Carcinoma (UC) 
The submission for UC is based on the analysis of the efficacy and safety data from: 
- 
IMvigor 210 (GO29293): a pivotal single-arm phase II study in patients with locally advanced 
or metastatic urothelial (bladder) cancer (UC) for the metastatic urothelial carcinoma indication;

IMvigor 211 (Study GO29294): a randomized phase III study comparing atezolizumab 
monotherapy to chemotherapy [investigator’s choice of one of vinflunine or a taxane such as paclitaxel 
or docetaxel] in second-/third-line patients with UC).  
- 
Supportive data from one phase Ia study PCD4989g (GO27831) conducted in patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic malignancies (including a cohort of patients with urothelial carcinoma) 
The proposed recommended dosage for atezolizumab in the treatment of UC is a fixed flat dose of 
1200 mg, every 3 weeks (q3w).  
2.6.1.  Dose response studies 
As described in section 2.5.1., the fixed dose of 1200 mg was selected on the basis of both nonclinical 
studies and available clinical data from Study PCD4989g. The atezolizumab dose was also informed by 
available clinical activity, safety, PK, and immunogenicity (ATA) data. No statistically significant 
Exposure- Response (ER) relationships were identified with ORR as assessed by an IRF using RECIST 
v1.1 following atezolizumab 1200 mg q3w in IMvigor 210, Cohorts 1 and 2. 
 
These results suggest no improved efficacy would be expected with atezolizumab doses higher 
than 1200 mg q3w. 
  None of the fold-changes in atezolizumab exposure associated with the statistically-significant 
covariates identified with the popPK model (body weight, gender, ATA, albumin, and tumor 
burden) would be expected to be clinically meaningful or require dose adjustment. 
 
The fold-reduction in atezolizumab exposure when evaluated at extreme values (i.e., 90th 
percentile) of weight compared to the typical patient following administration of the 
atezolizumab 1200 mg q3w flat dose would not be expected to be clinically meaningful or 
require dose adjustment by body size.

Urothelial Carcinoma Exposure-Safety Relationship 
  No statistically significant ER relationships were identified with AEG35 or AESIs following 
atezolizumab 15 mg/kg and 1200 mg q3w in patients with UC in the Phase Ia Study PCD4989g 
and in the Phase II Study IMvigor 210 (Cohort 1 and Cohort 2). 
 
These results suggest no improved safety would be expected with atezolizumab doses lower 
than 1200 mg q3w. 
  None of the fold-changes in atezolizumab exposure associated with the statistically significant 
covariates identified with the popPK model (body weight, gender, ATA, albumin, and tumour 
burden) would be expected to be clinically meaningful or require dose adjustment. 
 
The fold-elevation in atezolizumab exposure when evaluated at extreme values (i.e., 10th 
percentile) of weight compared to the typical patient following administration of the 
atezolizumab 1200 mg q3w flat dose would not be expected to be clinically meaningful or 
require dose adjustment by body size. 
2.6.2.  Main studies 
 
IMvigor 210 (GO29293) which is the pivotal study is a single-arm open-label Phase II study in

PD-L1 Expression, Scoring, and Selection Criteria in Urothelial Carcinoma 
In Study IMvigor 210 an investigational use only (IUO)-labeled assay was used to prospectively assess 
PD-L1 expression status in patients at baseline. The PD-L1 IHC assay and scoring system was 
developed to measure PD-L1-specific signals on both TCs and ICs using the VENTANA PD-L1 [SP142] 
IHC assay. The diagnostic assignment for ICs is shown in the Table below. Of note, although the IHC 
assay is optimized to measure PD-L1 expression on both TCs and ICs, the prevalence of PD-L1 
expression on TCs in UC is low. Therefore the VENTANA PD-L1 (SP142) IHC assay was not validated for 
intended use to measure PD-L1 expression on TCs in UC. PD-L1 expression on ICs was reported as the 
percentage of ICs with PD-L1 staining. Briefly, the scores of IC0, IC1, and IC2/3 were assigned to 
tumor samples with PD-L1 staining in < 1%, ≥ 1% to < 5%, and ≥ 5%, respectively of the ICs.

Treatments 
Patients were administered 1200 mg atezolizumab by IV infusion every 3 weeks (q3w). The initial dose 
of atezolizumab was delivered over 60 (± 15) minutes. If the first infusion was tolerated without 
infusion-associated AEs, the second infusion could be delivered over 30 (± 10) minutes. If the 30-
minute infusion was well tolerated, all subsequent infusions could be delivered over 30 (± 10) minutes. 
No premedication was allowed for the first dose of atezolizumab. Premedication could be administered 
for Cycles ≥ 2 at the discretion of the treating physician after consultation with the Medical Monitor. 
The management of infusion-related reactions was performed according to severity. 
Patients enrolled in Cohort 1 had to discontinue treatment at the first occurrence of unequivocal 
radiographic progression per RECIST v1.1.  
In Cohort 2, patients were permitted to continue study treatment beyond PD (per RECIST v1.1) if they 
met all of the following criteria: 
 
Evidence of clinical benefit (defined as the stabilization or improvement of disease-related 
symptoms) as assessed by the investigator  
  Absence of symptoms and signs indicating unequivocal progression of disease (including 
worsening of laboratory values; [e.g., new or worsening hypercalcemia])  
  No decline in ECOG PS from baseline that could be attributed to disease progression 
  Absence of tumour growth at critical anatomical sites (e.g., leptomeningeal disease) that could 
not be managed by protocol-allowed medical interventions  
At the discretion of the investigator, Cohort 2 patients for whom radiographic disease progression 
was confirmed at a subsequent tumour assessment could be considered for continued study 
treatment if they continued to meet the criteria above.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary: 
  ORR by IRF-assessment per RECIST v1.1 
  ORR by investigator  assessment per modified RECIST  (different criteria for  definition of  initial 
PD as most important difference compared to RECIST v 1.1) (Cohort 2 only) 
Secondary: 
  ORR by investigator assessment per RECIST v1.1 
  DOR and PFS by IRF assessment and by investigator-assessment per RECIST v1.1 
  DOR and PFS by investigator assessment per modified RECIST (Cohort 2 only) 
  OS and 1-year OS 
Sample size 
Enrollment of approximately 100 patients (minimum of 30 patients with IC2/3) was planned for Cohort 
1 of this study. With 30 IC2/3 patients dosed in Cohort 1, the 95% CI using the Clopper-Pearson 
method for an observed ORR of 40% would be 22.7%, 59.4%, and the study would have 98% power 
to detect a 30% increase in ORR from 10% to 40%. 
Enrollment of approximately 300 patients was planned for Cohort 2 of this study. The prevalence of 
IC2/3 was assumed to be approximately 30% in the overall locally advanced or metastatic urothelial 
carcinoma population. With 100 IC2/3 patients dosed in Cohort 2, the 95% CI using the Clopper-
Pearson method for an observed ORR of 40% would be 30.3%, 50.3%, and the study would have 
100% power to detect a 30% increase in ORR from 10% to 40%. Number planned: 400 patients 
(Cohort 1: approximately 100 patients; Cohort 2: approximately 300 patients). Number enrolled: 438 
patients (Cohort 1: 123 patients; Cohort 2: 315 patients). Number treated: 429 patients (Cohort 1: 
119 patients; Cohort 2: 310 patients). 
Randomisation 
No randomisation as this is a single-arm study. 
Blinding (masking) 
No blinding as this is a single-arm study. 
Statistical methods 
A hierarchical fixed-sequence testing procedure was used to compare the ORR in the three populations 
i.e., objective response-evaluable patients with an IHC score of IC2/3, objective response-evaluable 
patients with an IHC score of IC1/2/3, and all objective response-evaluable patients) separately in 
Cohorts 1 and 2, between the treatment arm with a historical control of 10%, while controlling the 
overall Type I error rate of 0.05. Estimates of ORR and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated 
using the Clopper-Pearson method. The exact binomial test was used to evaluate whether 
atezolizumab treatment resulted in a statistically significant difference in ORR between the observed 
ORR and the historical control ORR of 10%. 
Assessment report  
EMA/153102/2018  
Page 111/205 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Median OS, PFS, and DORs were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method; the 95% CIs for the 
median durations were computed using the Brookmeyer and Crowley method. Kaplan-Meier methods 
were used to estimate the OS rate at various timepoints (e.g., 1 year after enrollment); along with the 
corresponding 95% Cis constructed using Greenwood’s formula for the standard error. 
An interim efficacy analysis of Cohort 1 patients was planned to be performed at the final analysis of 
Cohort 2 when the last patient enrolled into Cohort 2 had at least 24 weeks of follow-up. For the 
Cohort 1 interim analyses, the efficacy analyses were performed on patients with at least 24 weeks of 
follow-up. The safety analyses were performed on patients treated as of the clinical cutoff date. The 
Cohort 1 final analysis will be performed when the last patient enrolled into Cohort 1 had at least 24 
weeks of follow-up. The alfa for the interim and final analyses for Cohort 1 was set as 0.001 and 
0.049, respectively.

Conduct of the study 
IMvigor 210 (GO29293) was an open label study and as such any change in study design during study 
conduct is considered critical. In this context, the major methodological changes introduced with 
amendment 6 (dated: 06.02.2015) are: Initially ORR was to be analysed in cohort 2 patients with IHC 
2/3, all treated patients with IHC 2/3 and all treated patients, however, with amendment 6 a statistical 
testing approach was introduced separately for cohort 1 and cohort 2 respectively with separate alpha 
spending for each cohort. Furthermore, in cohort 1, ORR according RECIST v1.1 should be analysed as 
primary endpoint while ORR according to modified RECIST v1.1 was no longer a primary endpoint in 
this cohort. These changes impact the value of p-values and the coverage of 95%-CI’s provided.

Table  63:  ORR  (IRF-Assessed)  per  RECIST  v1.1  (Cohort  1  Objective  Response  Evaluable  Population)  – 
IMvigor 210 
The result of the primary endpoint of IRF-assessed ORR per RECIST v1.1 did not meet statistical 
significance (p = 0.0717) compared to the historical control ORR of 10% in the IC2/3 subgroup, which 
was tested first in the hierarchical fixed-sequence procedure. The p-values for the IC1/2/3 subgroup 
and for all comers were 0.0247 and 0.0031, respectively. The p-values are provided for descriptive 
purposes only since the analyses in these populations were not to be formally conducted according to 
the pre-specified hierarchical fixed-sequence procedure. 
Updated data for Cohort 1 were provided with a clinical cut-off date (CCOD) of 4 July 2016 and a 
median survival follow-up of 17.2 months in the all comers population (representing approximately 10 
additional months of follow-up from the time of the primary analysis, 14 September 2015).

Notes 
Cohort 1: Primary endpoint (ORR per IRF, RECIST 1.1) in primary analysis (data cut-off 14 
Sept.  2015)  not  statistical  significant  (ORR  21.9%  for  IC2/3;  p  =  0.0717  compared  to 
historical control of 10%, pre-specified level of α = 0.049).  
Cohort 2: ORR results of the co-primary endpoints were statistical significant in the primary 
analysis (May 2015 data cut-off) for IC2/3, IC1/2/3 subgroups and all comers (compared to 
historical control of 10%). Statistical testing was not formally conducted for the updated 
analyses.

Clinical studies in special populations 
Atezolizumab has not been investigated in a paediatric patient population, this is reflected in section 
4.2.of the SmPC.  
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment and for patients 
with mild hepatic impairment; this is also reflected in section 4.2 of the SmPC.  
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses AND meta-analysis) 
 
Efficacy data from the primary analysis of Study IMvigor 210 Cohort 1 (data cutoff of 14 
September 2015) on 1L cisplatin-ineligible UC patients who received treatment with 
atezolizumab (1L cis-ineligible). Study IMvigor 210 is the first study in which atezolizumab is 
tested in this treatment-naive and cisplatin-ineligible UC population, and there are therefore no 
other studies on this population to be used for comparison in the following sections. 
 
Efficacy data from the primary analysis of Study IMvigor 210 Cohort 2 (data cutoff of 5 May 
2015) and the analysis of Study PCD4989g UC Cohort as of 2 December 2014 on 2L+ UC 
patients who received treatment with atezolizumab (2L+ UC). Data from selected efficacy 
endpoints from these individual studies are presented either side-by-side or in exploratory 
pooled analyses. 
Data are discussed for the pre-defined IC subgroups IC2/3 and IC1/2/3, all comers, as well as for the 
IC0 and IC1 subgroups for Study IMvigor 210 Cohort 1 and Cohort 2. Data are discussed by the IC 
subgroups IC0, IC1, IC2/3 for Study PCD4989g UC Cohort, the side-by-side presentations of Study 
IMvigor 210 Cohort 2 and Study PCD4989g UC Cohort, and the pooled efficacy population.

Treatments 
Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to treatment with either chemotherapy (vinflunine 320 mg/m2 
intravenous [IV] q3w, paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 IV q3w, or docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV q3w) or atezolizumab 
(1200 mg IV q3w). Within the chemotherapy arm, the percentage of patients treated with a taxane 
was intended to  be capped at approximately 40%; until that cap was reached, the selection of the 
specific chemotherapy (vinflunine or taxane) was per investigator’s choice. Patients in the 
chemotherapy arm received treatment until disease progression. Patients randomized to the 
atezolizumab arm received atezolizumab as long as they continued to experience clinical benefit in the 
opinion of the investigator or until unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic deterioration attributed to 
disease progression (i.e., pain secondary to disease or unmanageable ascites, etc.), as determined by 
the investigator after an integrated assessment of radiographic data, biopsy results (if available), and 
clinical status.

Objectives 
Primary objective: 
• 
OS,  defined  as  the  time  between  the  date  of  randomization  and  death  due  to  any  cause. 
Patients who were not reported as having died by the date of data cutoff for primary analysis 
were  censored  at  the  date  when  they  were last  known  to  be  alive.  Patients  who  do  not  have 
post-baseline information were censored at the date of randomization plus one day. 
Secondary objectives: 
 
 
 
 
ORR, defined as the proportion of patients with an objective response (either a complete 
response [CR] or partial response [PR]) as determined by the investigator with use of 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors, Version 1.1 (RECIST v1.1) 
PFS, defined as the time between the date of randomization and the date of first documented 
disease progression as determined by the investigator with use of RECIST v1.1 or death due to 
any cause, whichever occurs first 
DOR, defined as the time between the date of first documented response and the date of first 
documented disease progression as determined by the investigator with use of RECIST v1.1 or 
death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. 
Patient Reported Outcomes: UBC cancer symptoms, patient functioning, and health-related 
quality of life, (HRQoL) as measured by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment 
of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary: 
  OS  
Secondary: 
  ORR, PFS and DOR by investigator assessment per RECIST v1.1  
Sample size 
A total of 1360 patients were screened; of these, 931 patients were randomized: 464 patients to the 
chemotherapy arm (250 to vinflunine and 214 to taxanes) and 467 patients to the atezolizumab arm. 
A 40% cap on randomization to the taxanes within the chemotherapy arm was implemented as a 
protocol amendment after enrolment had begun. The number of events required to demonstrate 
efficacy of the atezolizumab treatment arm over the chemotherapy arm (i.e., vinflunine, paclitaxel, or 
docetaxel) with regard to OS were estimated on the basis of the following assumptions: 
• Two-sided significance level of 5% 
• 94% power for the primary analysis of OS in the IC2/3 population with an HR of 0.57, corresponding 
to an improvement in median OS from 7.5 months to 13.2 months 
• 98% power for the primary analysis of OS in the IC1/2/3 population with an HR of 0.68, 
corresponding to an improvement in median OS from 7.5 months to 11 months 
Assessment report  
EMA/153102/2018  
Page 132/205 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 97% power for the primary analysis of OS in the ITT population with an HR of 0.74, corresponding to 
an improvement in median OS from 7.5 months to 10.1 months 
• 1:1 randomization ratio 
• Dropout rate of 5% per year over 24 months 
Randomisation 
Eligible patients were randomized 1:1 to treatment with either chemotherapy (vinflunine 320 mg/m2 
intravenous [IV] q3w, paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 IV q3w, or docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV q3w) or atezolizumab 
(1200 mg IV q3w). Patients will receive atezolizumab as long as they continue to experience clinical 
benefit in the opinion of the investigator until unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic deterioration 
attributed to disease progression (i.e., pain secondary to disease or unmanageable ascites, etc.) as 
determined by the investigator after an integrated assessment of radiographic data, biopsy results (if 
available), and clinical status. Within the chemotherapy arm, the percentage of patients treated with a 
taxane was intended to be capped at approximately 40%; until that cap was reached, the selection of 
the specific chemotherapy (vinflunine or taxane) was per investigator’s choice. 
Randomization was stratified by chemotherapy (vinflunine vs. taxane), PD-L1 IHC status (IC0/1 vs. 
IC2/3), liver metastasis (yes vs. no) and number of baseline prognostic risk factors (0 vs. 1/2/3). 
Prognostic risk factors included time from prior chemotherapy of <3 months, Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status >0 and hemoglobin <10 g/dL. The choice of 
chemotherapy (vinflunine vs. taxane) was pre-specified by the investigator prior to randomization. 
Blinding (masking) 
IMvigor 211 was an open label study. 
Statistical methods 
Comparisons with respect to OS between the treatment arm and control arm within the IC2/3, 
IC1/2/3, and intent-to-treat (ITT, i.e. all-comers) populations were tested using a hierarchical fixed-
sequence procedure based on a stratified log-rank test at two-sided level of 5% as follows: step 1) 
IC2/3 population; step 2) IC1/2/3 population; step 3) all-comers population. Each of steps 2 and 3 
were to be tested only if the null hypothesis of its preceding step is rejected i.e. the IC1/2/3 population 
could be tested for statistical significance only if the primary endpoint was statistically significant in the 
IC2/3 population, and similarly the all-comers population could be tested for statistical significance 
only if the primary endpoint was statistically significant in the IC1/2/3 population. The analysis 
hierarchy also specified that the secondary endpoints of ORR and PFS were each to be tested in a 
similarly hierarchical fashion following the analysis of OS. The primary analysis was planned when 
approximately 152, 403, and 652 deaths had been observed in the IC2/3, IC1/2/3, and all-comers 
populations, respectively, whichever occurred later.

OS results were different according to the chemotherapy subgroup (taxane vs. vinflunine as specified 
by the investigator at the time of randomization). For patients who were intended to treat with taxane, 
a numerical OS improvement was observed in the atezolizumab arm (n=215) compared with taxanes 
(n=214); the HR was 0.75 (95%CI: 0.60, 0.94). In the vinflunine subgroup, no OS improvement was 
observed when comparing atezolizumab (n=252) with vinflunine (n=250) (HR=0.92 [0.75, 1.13]). KM

Supportive study – Study PCD4989g (GO27831)  
Study PCD4989g is an ongoing Phase Ia, multicentre, first-in-human, open-label, dose-escalation 
trial designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab in patients 
with locally advanced or metastatic solid malignancies or hematologic malignancies, including a cohort 
of patients with UC (2L+ UC). 
Study participants: 
Study PCD4989g UC Cohort enrolled patients with locally advanced and metastatic or recurrent UC, 
with measurable disease at baseline assessed per RECIST v1.1 and ECOG PS of 0 or 1. Disease was 
progressing since the last antitumor therapy. 
Treatment: 
Atezolizumab IV infusion q3w at 15 mg/kg or 1200 mg. Overall, 86 patients received a weight-based 
dosing of 15 mg/kg and 6 patients were dosed with a fixed flat dose of 1200 mg of atezolizumab.  
Patients remained on study treatment as long as they continued to experience clinical benefit (or 
occurrence of unacceptable toxicity or symptomatic deterioration attributed to radiographic PD). 
Analysis populations: 
The  primary  analysis  population  identified  for  the  UC  indication  was  the  safety-evaluable  population, 
which  comprised  all  enrolled  patients  who  received  any  amount  of  atezolizumab  (n  =  92)  as  of  2 
December 2014. 
Efficacy Endpoints 
Primary:  
  Confirmed ORR per investigator RECIST v1.1 and by IRF RECIST v1.1 assessments 
Secondary: 
  BOR (best overall response) (unconfirmed), DOR, 6-month PFS, 1-year PFS per RECIST v1.1; 
and 1-year OS IRF per RECIST v1.1 
In  the  updated  analysis  of  the  PCD4989g  UC  Cohort,  there  were  93  patients who  were  OR-evaluable 
with at least a 24-week follow-up. The median duration of follow-up in this updated analysis was 20.0

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
  Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal study is a single-arm study. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are uncontroversial and 
clearly define the target population as treatment-naïve cisplatin-ineligible patients or as patients that 
have progressed during or following a platinum-containing regimen.  
A single-arm trial design can be appropriate for a setting where there is no approved or acceptable 
therapeutic option. In the 1L cisplatin ineligible patients, there is no established standard of care, and 
having in mind the poor prognosis in these patient, it may be justified not randomizing patients to 
“physicians best choice”. With regard to 2L patients, vinflunine is currently the only approved option 
for patients that have progressed after or on first-line treatment with platinum-containing 
chemotherapy regimen.  
The 10% historical control rate was based on the SEER-medicare data, where the Applicant has 
calculated a weighted average where approximately 75% of the patients enrolled in Cohort 1 would not 
receive therapy (the expected ORR would be 0%), and 25% of the patients would receive 
carboplatinum-based therapy (the expected ORR would be 36%). The Applicant acknowledges that the 
patients enrolled in Cohort 1 did not match the expected population, and that statistical significance 
could not be demonstrated.

During the procedure the Applicant provided top-line results from study IMvigor 211, a randomised 
phase 3 study in the second line setting comparing atezolizumab to chemotherapy (vinflunine or 
taxanes (docetaxel or paclitaxel)). 
  Efficacy data and additional analyses 
IMvigor 210 - Cohort 1 – 1L cisplatin-ineligible 
The Applicant adjusted for multiplicity by using a hierarchical testing procedure, since the result in the 
IC2/3 subgroup was statistically non-significant (p=0.0717), statistical testing in the IC1/2/3 and the 
all comers group cannot formally be conducted. The p-value in these subgroups are significant 
(IC1/2/3 subgroup (p = 0.02469) and all comers (p = 0.0031)), but are as a consequence only for 
descriptive purposes alone. It is also important to mention that the number of patients in the IC2/3 
subgroup is very small (n=32). The ORR by INV is 31.3%, but only three more patients have been 
deemed to have a response.   
The effect of atezolizumab seems to be independent of PD-L1 expression level in 1L cisplatin-ineligible. 
In the primary analyses, patients with IC0 and IC1 obtain response rates of 20.5% and 16.7% 
respectively. The median duration of response (DOR) was not reached in any IC subgroup or all 
comers. Responses appear to be durable, with 22 of 23 responders having an ongoing response by the 
clinical cut-off date. However in the primary analysis this was based on a median duration of follow-up 
of 8.5 months (in the all comer population) and only 14 of 23 responders have a duration of follow-up 
of ≥ 6 months, 4 responders ≥ 9 months and none ≥ 12 months. 
The patient population enrolled into Cohort 1 did not match the expectations to include both 
chemotherapy eligible and ineligible patient populations. The 10% historical control response rate that 
was assumed at the time of the study design is therefore not appropriate as historical comparator. The 
patient population ultimately enrolled in Cohort 1 may be best compared to the population enrolled in 
the EORTC 30986 trial (with CarboGem representing the most appropriate historical comparator). The 
Applicant presented the baseline characteristics of the EORTC 30986 trial compared with IMvigor 210 
in order to justify that the two populations may be considered comparable. However some clinically 
relevant prognostic criteria appear more favourable for Cohort 1, such as the lower proportion of 
patients with ECOG PS 2, lower proportion of subjects with both impaired renal function and PS2, lower 
proportion of Bajorin risk group 2 and the inclusion of subjects with only prior chemotherapy in the 
neoadjuvant/adjuvant setting. Nonetheless it is acknowledged that overall subjects included in Cohort 
1 can be considered representative of a patient population that would be considered eligible for a 
carboplatin containing combination chemotherapy. 
Medians of IRF-assessed PFS per RECIST v1.1 were similar across the pre-defined IC subgroups and all 
comers (2.92, 2.30, and 2.40 months in the IC2/3 subgroup, the IC1/2/3 subgroup, and all comers, 
respectively). 
Median OS was 10.6 months in each of the IC2/3, IC1/2/3 subgroups, and in all comers. However, OS 
data were immature based on a median duration of follow-up of only 8.5 months.  
Updated data for Cohort 1 were provided with a clinical cut-off date (CCOD) of 4 July 2016 and a 
median survival follow-up of 17.2 months in the all comer population (representing approximately 10 
additional months of follow-up from the time of the primary analysis, 14 September 2015). With longer 
follow-up the number of responses increased from 23 to 27 leading to an ORR of 22.7% in the all 
comer population. With five additional complete responses updated CR rate was 9.2%. Responses 
remain ongoing for the majority of patients (70.4%), the median duration of response was not reached 
(range for all comers: 3.7 to 21.0 months). Median OS was 15.9 months (95% CI: 10.4, NE) in the all-
comers population, with a 12 months OS rate of 57.2%.

Although overall response rates of atezolizumab compare less favourably to the best historical 
comparator of CarboGem (22.7% vs. 36.1%), responses were ongoing in 70% of patients with a 
median follow-up of 17.2 months (median DOR not reached compared to 5.3 months for Carbo/Gem).  
In order to further support the efficacy of atezolizumab treatment in 1L UC patients, the applicant 
should submit the results of the ongoing post authorisation efficacy study (PAES) IMvigor 130, a Phase 
III randomized study evaluating the safety and efficacy of Atezolizumab monotherapy vs. Atezolizumab 
and carboplatin/gemcitabine vs cisplatin/gemcitabine in cisplatin-ineligible and –eligible patients which 
are expected to be available by 31 July 2021 (see Annex II). This data will provide further confirmation 
of the efficacy assumptions as determined from this application in a randomised controlled trial 
providing direct comparative efficacy results including PFS and OS. 
IMvigor 210 Cohort 2 – 2L+  
Efficacy results of the non-randomized Study Imvigor 210 (Cohort 2) demonstrated an ORR of 15.8% 
and a median OS of 7.9 months in the overall study population (n=310). These data are in the range 
of historical chemotherapy controls.  
IMvigor 211  
Overall, IMvigor 211 confirmed the efficacy results of IMvigor 210. Although ORR results are 
numerically slightly lower in IMvigor 211 compared to IMvigor 210 (about 5%), OS data are 
comparable. Median PFS of atezolizumab was 2.1 months both in IMvigor 211 and in IMvigor 210.  
With the applied hierarchical testing (based on the assumption of a predictive value of PD-L1 
expression) the study failed to demonstrate a statistically significant OS benefit.  
With a median duration of follow up of 17.3 months, response in the all-comers population was 
ongoing in a majority of responders in the atezolizumab arm (62.9%) compared to 21% in 
chemotherapy arm. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of median DOR in the atezolizumab arm was 21.7 
months compared to 7.4 months in the chemotherapy arm.  
A retrospective review of OS events in the period from randomization until the time of the crossing of 
the Kaplan Meier OS curves was performed. However, no specific characteristics could be identified to 
select a patient population likely not deriving benefit from atezolizumab.

Study IMvigor 211 resolved the concerns of a lower treatment effect of atezolizumab in subjects with 
lower PD-L1 expression subgroups (IC0/IC1), but failed to demonstrate significance in the primary OS 
analysis (which is partly attributed to the fact that PD-L1 expression proved to be rather of prognostic 
than of predictive value in this data set).  
OS data for atezolizumab were numerically superior to SOC for the overall study population and across 
all IC subgroups. Although this OS advantage appeared to be driven by the comparison to taxanes (HR 
0.75), OS for atezolizumab was similar based on visual exploration compared to vinflunine (the only 
approved drug in this disease setting) (HR 0.92).  
Hence, in order to further support the efficacy of atezolizumab treatment in 1L and 2L+ UC the 
applicant should submit the final results of the PAES IMvigor 210 which are expected to be available by 
30 June 2019 (see Annex II). In addition, the applicant should submit the final results of PAES IMvigor 
211 (see Annex II) by 31 May 2019.  
These data from studies IMvigor 210 and IMvigor 211 will provide further confirmation of the efficacy 
assumptions as determined from this application in terms of more mature efficacy outcomes and 
detailed results from study IMvigor 211 as only top-line results were available during the procedure.  
Finally, the applicant is recommended to provide a “biomarker analysis plan” with timelines and should 
submit the results of all ongoing and planned biomarker analyses post-approval. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, study IMvigor 211 resolved the concerns of a lower treatment effect of atezolizumab in 
subjects with lower PD-L1 expression subgroups (IC0/IC1), but failed to demonstrate significance in 
the primary OS analysis.  
Response rates in the same range as for chemotherapy have been demonstrated consistently in 767 2L 
UC patients across IMvigor 210 and IMvigor 211. Duration of responses was substantially longer for 
treatment with atezolizumab (median DOR 21.7 vs. 7.4 months in the atezolizumab vs. control arm). 
OS data for atezolizumab were numerically superior to SOC for the overall study population and across 
all IC subgroups. It is recognised that response rates (and the proportion of patients that clearly 
benefit from atezolizumab) are small in 2L UC (and in this setting there is ultimately a need for 
combination therapies). But given the sustained responses, the overall numerically favourable OS 
results, efficacy can be considered established.  
With regard to 1L cisplatin ineligible UC there is a high unmet medical need and durable responses 
have been demonstrated in Cohort 1 of IMvigor 210 that seem to be translated in a survival benefit. 
Results from the on-going randomized Study IMvigor 130, study IMvigor 210 and Study IMvigor 211 
are requested as PAES. Finally, the applicant is recommended to provide a “biomarker analysis plan” 
with timelines and should submit the results of all ongoing and planned biomarker analyses post-
approval. 
2.7.  Clinical safety 
The overall safety database includes a total of 2160 patients (All Patients Population), including 1636 
(75.7%) patients with NSCLC and 524 (24.3%) patients with UC, as per the below table.

From these studies, 3 main pooled safety populations were defined: 
 
Pooled All Patients (N=2160): all safety evaluable patients enrolled in Studies, OAK 
(atezolizumab treated patients only), BIRCH, POPLAR (atezolizumab treated patients only), 
FIR, the UC and NSCLC Cohorts of Study PCD4989g and the Cohorts 1 and 2 of study IMvigor 
210. 
 
Pooled All NSCLC population (N=1636): all NSCLC safety evaluable patients from Studies OAK 
(atezolizumab treated patients only), BIRCH, POPLAR (atezolizumab treated patients only), 
FIR, and the NSCLC Cohort of Study PCD4989g. 
o  A subpopulation analysis was performed based on all treated 2L+NSCLC patients 
(atezolizumab arm of OAK study, Cohorts 2 and 3 of BIRCH study, atezoluzumab arm 
of POPLAR, Cohorts 2 and 3 of FIR and NSCLC cohort (2L+) of study PCD4989g). 
 
Pooled All UC population (N=524): all safety evaluable patients with UC and comprises patients 
enrolled in Study IMvigor 210 (both Cohorts 1 and 2), and the UC Cohort of Study PCD4989g.  
In all atezolizumab clinical studies, patients were categorized based on PD-L1 expression in tumour 
cells (TC) (NCSLC setting only) and immune-cell (IC) (UC and NCSLC settings). Safety was also 
evaluated in the TC/IC subpopulations as described in the below table.

In addition, supportive safety data were provided from Study IMvigor 211. In this study, patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) who have progressed during or following a 
platinum-containing regimen were randomized to treatment with either chemotherapy (vinflunine 320 
mg/m2 intravenous [IV] q3w, paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 IV q3w, or docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV q3w) or 
atezolizumab (1200 mg IV q3w).

Atezolizumab-treated patients from this study were not included in the pooled analysis. 
Patient exposure 
All patients in the IMvigor 210, OAK, BIRCH, POPLAR and FIR studies were exposed to atezolizumab 
1200 mg given q3w. In the supportive study PCD4989g, 86 patients from the UC Cohort and 26 
patients from the NSCLC Cohort of PCD4989g received atezolizumab at a dose of 15 mg/kg q3w 
(equivalent to 1200 mg for an 80 kg adult patient), and 50 patients, 11 patients, and 1 patient in the 
NSCLC Cohort of PCD4989g received 20 mg/kg q3w, 10 mg/kg q3w, and 1 mg/kg q3w, respectively.  
At the fixed dose of 1200 mg, the median duration of exposure to atezolizumab was 3.5 months in the 
All Patients population (range 0.0-26.3 months): 2.9 months in the All UC population and 3.6 months 
in the All NSCLC population. Overall, 54.7% of patients had received more than 3 months of 
atezolizumab treatment, 37.0% had received more than 6 months of treatment, and 21.4% had 
received more than 12 months of treatment. The median number of treatment cycles received was 6 
(range: 1 - 38).

Adverse events 
Per the study protocols for Study IMvigor 210, OAK, POPLAR, BIRCH, FIR and PCD4989g, adverse 
events were collected from the day of administration of the first dose of study treatment until 30 days 
(IMvigor210, OAK and BIRCH) or 90 days (POPLAR, FIR and PCD4989g) after the last does of study 
drug or until initiation of another non-protocol anti-cancer therapy, whichever occurred first. For AESIs 
and treatment-related SAEs, no 30-day or 90-day window was applied. 
A categorical overview of the AE safety profile for the different populations is presented in the table

  Grade 5 AEs due to PD are excluded for studies GO27831 and GO28625. 
The incidence of fatigue, urinary tract infection (UTI), oedema peripheral, abdominal pain, and 
haematuria was higher in the All UC population, whereas dyspnoea and cough were more frequent in 
the All NSCLC population. 
The most common Grade 3 or 4 AEs (> 2% of patients) by preferred term were dyspnoea, anaemia, 
fatigue, hyponatraemia and pneumonia.

Adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
Overall, 30.0% of the All Patients Population reported at least one AESI. The most common AESIs (> 
2% of patients) were reported in the following SOCs (with the most common AE PTs, reported in at 
least 2% of patients): skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (16.0%), most commonly rash (10.6%) 
and maculo-papular rash (2.3%); Investigations (7.8%), most commonly AST (5.3%) and ALT (4.9%) 
increased; Endocrine disorders (4.8%), most commonly hypothyroidism (3.9%); Nervous system

disorders (3.8%), most commonly neuropathy peripheral (3.2%); Respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders (2.7%), most commonly pneumonitis (2.5%).  
The majority of patients experienced AESIs of Grade 1 or Grade 2 maximum intensity (81.0%, 
525/648). Overall, 79 patients (3.7%) experienced an AESI reported as serious, with the most 
commonly reported event of pneumonitis (1.3%, of which 24/28 were from the NSCLC population).  
Serious adverse events  
The proportion of patients reporting at least one SAE of any grade in the All Patients Population was 
38.5%, 44.7% in the All UC and 36.6% in the All NSCLC populations. The most common SAEs were 
reported in the following SOCs (≥5% of patients): Infections and infestations (10.2%), most 
commonly (more than 1% of patients) pneumonia and UTI; Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders (9.8%), most commonly dyspnoea, pneumonitis, pulmonary embolism, and pleural effusion; 
General disorders and administration site conditions (6.1%), most commonly pyrexia; Gastrointestinal 
disorders (6.0%). 
Other commonly reported SAEs by preferred term that occurred in more than 1% of patients in the ‘All 
Patients Population’ were back pain and pulmonary embolism.

Treatment-related SAEs were reported in 9.4% of patients in the ‘All Patients population’. Treatment-
related SAEs reported in 4 or more patients (≥0.3%) were pneumonitis (1.0%), pyrexia (0.8%), 
diarrhoea (0.6%), colitis, nausea, AST increased (0.4% each), pneumonia, ALT increased, 
hypothyroidism and muscular weakness (0.3% each). 
Deaths 
At the time of data cut-off dates for each study, a total of 1248 patients (57.8%) had died. The 
majority of deaths occurred beyond 30 days after last dose (80.7% [1007/1248]). The most common 
reason for death was progression of the underlying disease, which accounted for 85.1% (1062/1248) 
of all deaths.  
The causes of death are listed in the table below. 
Table 88 Summary of Deaths and Primary Cause of Death (Safety Evaluable Population) 
Overall, 80 deaths1 were attributed to AEs. Grade 5 AEs occurring within 30 days after last dose of 
study treatment or prior to initiation of non-protocol anti-cancer therapy were reported in 2.4% 
(52/2160) of All Patients, including 8 patients (1.5%) from the ALL UC population and 44 patients 
(2.7%) from the All NSCLC population. Grade 5 AEs were reported in a variety of system organ classes 
(SOCs) and the following AE preferred terms were reported for more than one patient: pneumonia (6), 
death (4), cardiac arrest (3), sepsis (3), sudden death (3), septic shock (2), respiratory failure (2), 
lung infection (2), and cardiac failure (2).  
Four Grade 5 AEs occurring within 30 days after the last dose of study treatment or prior to initiation of 
non-protocol therapy were considered by the investigator as treatment related. No patient experienced 
a fatal AE within 30 days after the last dose of study treatment or prior to initiation of non-protocol 
therapy that was considered by the investigator to be related to atezolizumab treatment in Studies 
OAK and PCD4989g.  
1 One patient death in Study BIRCH included in Table 88 was reported as a death due to AE at the time of data cut-
off but was actually a death due to progressive disease.

Within the ADRs, important immune-related events of particular clinical relevance (important ADRs) 
were identified and included hypothyroidism, hypophysistis, diabetes mellitus, pneumonitis, colitis, 
hyperthyroidism, pancreatitis, hepatitis, non-infectious meningoencephalitis, adrenal insufficiency, 
Guillain Barré syndrome, myasthenic syndrome, and infusion relation reactions. 
Overall, 549 patients (25.4%) experienced an important ADR, the majority (83.8% [460/549]) of 
these being Grade 1 or 2 maximum intensity. Eighty-eight of 549 patients (16.0%) with an important 
ADR had a Grade 3-4 event, and one patient had a Grade 5 event (pneumonitis).  
The most commonly observed immune-related events are hypothyroidism and pneumonitis. The 
incidence of immune-related pneumonitis is systematically higher in the All NSCLC Population, with AEs 
of higher Grade as compared to the All UC Population.  
Systemic corticosteroid treatment was administered to 78 patients of 549 (14.2%) patients with 
important ADRs. Atezolizumab treatment was discontinued for 28 patients (1.3%), and 101 patients 
(4.7%) had a dose interruption due to an important ADR. The median time to onset and median time 
from onset to resolution for all important ADR groups (for all patients and patients treated with 
systemic corticosteroids) differ from ADR to ADR. Details are provided in the table below. 
These observations were consistent between all patients’ populations (UC and NSCLC).

Table 91 Summary of safety information for important adverse drug reactions for atezolizumab (All 
Patient population) 
** Incidence reflects events included in respective SMQs and the sponsor defined AEGTs 
At the clinical cut-off dates for the 6 studies, no patients had AEs in the myasthenic syndrome SMQ, 
however, these events were observed in other clinical studies in the atezolizumab clinical development 
program.  
In the All Patients population, 308 patients (14.3%) treated with atezolizumab experienced infusion-
related reactions (IRRs)/hypersensitivity (type I). IRR include AEs under the sponsor defined AEGT 
occurring within 24 hours of dosing. Signs and symptoms of IRRs included in the sponsor defined AEGT 
overlap with several very common atezolizumab ADRs, including chills, dyspnoea, hypotension, 
influenza-like illness, pyrexia, and rash.  The rate of all grade IRR AEs was similar between UC 
(13.0%) and NSCLC (14.7%) patients.  This included 10 Grade 3 events and 1 Grade 4 event.  There 
were no Grade 5 events.  Five events required systemic corticosteroid treatment.  The majority of the 
IRRs were Grade 1 or 2 events.

Laboratory safety findings  
Haematology 
Overall, although small fluctuations were observed, medial values remained within the normal range 
during the entire treatment period. Of note, median values for hematocrit, hemoglobin and red blood 
cell counts at baseline were below or at the lower limit of the standard reference range in all studies. 
During treatment with atezolizumab, median values did not decrease further. 
Clinically relevant hematology laboratory abnormalities that were reported as AEs (i.e., Grade 3 or 4 
hematology AEs), occurred at a low incidence with the most common (≥2% of patients in any study) 
being anemia, and thrombocytopenia. 
Assessment report  
EMA/153102/2018  
Page 161/205 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Serum chemistry 
Abnormalities in blood chemistry parameters which were reported as Grade 3 or 4 AEs occurred at a 
low incidence with the most common events being hyponatraemia, hypokalaemia, ALT and AST 
increased. Chemistry laboratory results were consistent across the 6 studies. 
Overall,  22  patients  across  the  6  studies  fulfilled  the  laboratory  criteria  for  Hy’s  Law:  AST  and/or 
ALT    3  ULN  concurrent  (within  7  days)  with  total bilirubin  (TBILI)    2  ULN.  In  all  but  one patient, 
other confounding factors were present, so the cases do not qualify as Hy’s law cases.  For a patient 
that  developed  changes  in  liver  function  tests  after  four  cycles,  no  alternate  etiology  was  identified.  
However,  based  on  the  mechanism  of  action  of  atezolizumab,  changes  in  liver  function  tests  and 
hepatitis have been reported with atezolizumab and are considered a known risk.  
No  clinically  meaningful  changes  in  median  values  over  time  for  any  vital  sign  parameters  were 
observed in any of the 6 studies.  
Anti-Therapeutic Antibodies 
Overall, among the safety-evaluable patients with available post-treatment ATA status 39.1% 
(785/2007) had ATA. Irrespective of population, the incidences of Grade 5 AEs and AEs leading to 
treatment discontinuation were very low and comparable. With regard to Grade 3-4 AEs, sligthly more 
SAEs were observed in ATA-positive patients. Some numerical differences were observed in Grade 3-4 
AEs (40.7% in ATA-negative vs. 47.0% in ATA-positive patients), which was mainly driven by AEs 
reported in the Metabolism and nutrition disorders SOC (40.4% vs. 44.3%) and the decreased appetite 
PT (24.9% vs. 27.6%) within the Metabolism and nutrition disorders SOC in ATA-positive patients. The 
incidence of SAEs was numerically higher in ATA-positive patients (40.5%) compared with ATA-
negative patients (34.0%), but this difference was not driven by any specific SOC or individual AE 
preferred term. 
In the All Patients population, the incidence of hypersensitivity and IRRs (MedDRA PTs) (not 
necessarily occurring on the same day as an atezolizumab infusion) was low and consistent between 
ATA-positive and ATA-negative patients. Hypersensitivity events were reported in 24 patients (1.2%): 
9 ATA-negative (0.7%) and 15 ATA-positive (1.9%) patients. Infusion-related reactions occurred in 25 
patients (1.2%): 14 ATA-negative (1.1%) and 11 ATA-positive (1.4%) patients.

status) 
ECG and Vital signs 
No clinically meaningful changes were observed in median values over time for any vital sign 
parameters (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, pulse rate or respiratory rate) in the All Patient 
Population. 
Data available from the FIR study and extended analyses performed in the PCD4989g study showed no 
trend between atezolizumab concentration and QT interval in the studied dose range including the 
proposed dose of 1200 mg. Thus, no clinically meaningful QT changes are expected in relation to 
atezolizumab treatment. 
Treatment group comparisons 
Atezolizumab versus docetaxel in NSCLC patients 
Study OAK  
At the time of primary analysis, patients in the atezolizumab arm received treatment for a longer 
duration compared with docetaxel (median treatment duration: 2.1 months for docetaxel vs. 3.4 
months for atezolizumab). The proportion of patients receiving treatment for 12 months or more was 
higher in the atezolizumab arm (20.5%) compared with docetaxel (2.4%).

Table 94 Study OAK: Overview of safety (cut-off date: 7 July 2016) 
The most commonly reported AESIs (≥5% of patients in any treatment group) were dermatological 
reactions (rash) in both arms, nervous system disorders (peripheral neuropathy) in the docetaxel arm, 
and hepatic events (ALT and AST increased) in the atezolizumab arm. Grade 3 AESIs were reported for 
4.6% of patients receiving atezolizumab and 2.4% of patients receiving docetaxel. Three patients in 
the atezolizumab arm experienced Grade 4 AESIs (hepatitis [2 patients], blood bilirubin increased [1 
patient]). 
No clinically relevant changes in median values for laboratory safety parameters or vital signs were 
observed during atezolizumab treatment. Changes in median values for haematology parameters were 
as expected during docetaxel treatment.

In this study, patients in the atezolizumab arm (N=142) received treatment for a median of 3.7 
months as compared to patients in the docetaxel arm (N=135) who received treatment for a median of 
2.1 months. Additionally, the proportion of patients receiving treatment for ≥12 months was 21.1%

Grade 3 or 4 AEs occurred in 52.6% (docetaxel) and 40.1% (atezolizumab). Of these, 38.6% 
(docetaxel) and 11.3% (atezolizumab) were considered related to study drug. The incidence of Grade 
5 AEs was low (3.7% docetaxel vs. 4.2% atezolizumab) and only in few patients (3 (2.2%) docetaxel 
vs. 1 (0.7%) atezolizumab) were the Grade 5 AEs considered related to study treatment. With regard 
to SAEs, the incidence was 34.1% (docetaxel) and 35.2% (atezolizumab). Related SAEs occurred in 
17.0% (docetaxel) and 8.5% (atezolizumab). 
AESIs of any Grade were observed in 29.6% (docetaxel) and 28.9% (atezolizumab). The incidence of 
Grade 3-4 AESIs was 3.0% (docetaxel) and 5.6% (atezolizumab). No patients in either arm 
experienced a Grade 5 AESI.

To adjust for the longer period on treatment of the atezolizumab arm compared with the docetaxel 
arm, adjusted analyses for patient-year at risk were performed where atezolizumab had a higher 
incidence than docetaxel.

More patients receiving chemotherapy compared with atezolizumab reported treatment related Grade 3 
or 4 AEs, treatment related SAEs and treatment related AEs leading to dose withdrawal. The frequency 
of Grade 5 AEs (within 30 days after last dose) was comparable between treatment arms. The 
incidence of AESIs was higher in the atezolizumab arm than chemotherapy arm as these are specific to 
atezolizumab, however, in the majority of cases, these events were mild or moderate in severity. One 
Grade 5 AESI (with preferred term pneumonitis) was reported in the chemotherapy arm, and none in 
the atezolizumab arm.

Safety in special populations 
Age 
Overall, in the All Patients Population, there was no noteworthy difference in the safety profile of 
atezolizumab based on age (65 years vs 65 years). However numerical differences were observed 
between the age groups for AEs leading to dose interruption (23.7% for 65 vs. 27.2% for 65).  
No data are available with regard to the safety profile of Tecentriq in children and adolescents aged 
below 18 years.

Gender 
Nearly twice as many male as female study participants were included in the All Patients population. 
The total number of patients experiencing an AE was approximately 95% with an incidence slightly 
lower in the female All UC subgroup and slightly higher in the female All NSCLC subgroup. The 
incidence of Grade 5 AEs was low in all subgroups. With regard to SAEs, AEs leading to dose 
interruption and AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation, the incidences were systematically 
higher among the male subgroups. However there was no difference regarding the SOCs of the 
reported events.

Caucasians accounted for 84.8% of the All Patients population, as compared to 2.2% of Blacks, 7.7% 
of Asians and 5.3% of other races). 
Histology 
Based on NSCLC histology, the safety profile of atezolizumab was similar between subgroups and 
comparable to the 2L+NSCLC All Patients population. The total number of patients experiencing AEs 
was 92.0% (Squamous) vs. 95.9% (Non-squamous). There were no major differences between the 
squamous and non-squamous subpopulations.  
Table 103 Overview of Safety by Histology (2L+NSCLC Safety-Evaluable Patients) 
Level of PD-L1 expression 
  All NSCLC Population 
Based on PD-L1 expression, the total number of the All NSCLC population experiencing AEs was 
94.8%. Grade 3 or 4 AEs occurred in 40.3% while the incidence of Grade 5 AEs was low (2.7%). The 
incidence of SAEs was 36.6%. The incidence of AEs leading to dose interruption was 26.5%% while the 
incidence of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation was 7.2%. The incidence of AESIs of any Grade 
was 29.5%. The incidence of Grade 3 to 4 AESIs was 5.2% and one (<0.1%) Grade 5 AESI was 
observed in the 2L+NSCLC All Patients population.  
There were no major or clinically relevant differences between TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3 and TC2/3 or IC2/3.

Furthermore, when analysing safety data of patients expressing TC0 or IC0 for the docetaxel and 
atezolizumab treated patients of the OAK and POPLAR studies (see below table), the incidence of the 
various types of AEs is generally comparable to the ITT population meaning that quite consistently the 
incidence of the various types of AEs was lower in the atezolizumab arm as compared to the docetaxel 
arm. Overall, atezolizumab had a favourable safety profile compared to docetaxel in this subgroup of 
NSCLC patients.

  All UC Population  
1L UC All Comers population  
Based on PD-L1 expression, the total number of the 1L UC All Comers population experiencing AEs was 
96.6%, with Grade 3 or 4 AEs occurring in 42.9% and Grade 5 AEs in 3.4%. The incidence of SAEs was 
35.3% and the incidence of AEs leading to dose interruption was 32.8% while the incidence of AEs 
leading to treatment discontinuation was 5.9%. The incidence of AESIs of any Grade was 26.9%. The 
incidence of Grade 3 to 4 AESIs was 5.0% and no Grade 5 AESIs were observed in the 1L UC All 
Comers population.  
When dividing patients into subgroups based on IC0, IC1, IC1/2/3 or IC2/3 numerical differences were 
observed but the sample size was small in several of the subgroups and the differences were not 
considered clinically meaningful.  
2L+UC All Comers population  
Based on PD-L1 expression, the total number of 2L+UC All Comers population experiencing AEs was 
95.8%. Grade 3 or 4 AEs occurred in 47.4% while the incidence of Grade 5 AEs was low (1.0%). The 
incidence of SAEs were 44.7%. The incidence of AEs leading to dose interruption was 25.1% while the 
incidence of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation was 3.2%. The incidence of AESIs of any Grade 
was 26.8%. The incidence of Grade 3 to 4 AESIs was 4.7% and no Grade 5 AESIs were observed in the 
UC 1L All Comers population.  
When dividing patients into subgroups based on IC0, IC1, IC1/2/3 or IC2/3 once again numerical 
differences were observed. However, albeit the sample size in the subgroups was larger compared to 
the 1L UC population, it is still not considered clinically meaningful to draw conclusions based on the 
observed differences.

Evaluable Patients) 
Hepatic and renal function 
Safety data for patients with organ dysfunction is limited (e.g., kidney and liver dysfunction). Based on 
a popPK analysis, no dose adjustment is required in patients with renal impairment or in patients with 
mild hepatic impairment.  
There are no data in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment and data in patients with 
severe renal impairment are limited.

Use in pregnancy and lactation 
No data regarding pregnancies in the clinical studies were available at the cut-off date.  
Overdose 
No  data  regarding  overdose  with  atezolizumab  are  available.  The  highest  tested  dose  in  the  clinical 
development programme was 20 mg/kg every 3 weeks.  
Region 
The incidence of adverse events across regions is described in the below table: 
Table 107 Safety by region (safety evaluable patients) 
While differences by regions were noted, no individual SOCs or PTs were noted to account for these 
regional differences and these findings were not considered clinically significant.  
Overall, the safety profile of atezolizumab remained consistent across regions. 
Smoking status 
Patients who had never smoked accounted for 21.4% (462 of 2160 patients) of the All Patients 
population, and the remaining 78.6% (1698 of 2160 patients) were current or previous smokers.  
Increased toxicity was seen in the current or previous smoker group, especially grade 5 AEs in the 
NSCLC group. 
In the UC population, the increased incidence of serious adverse events were related to infections and 
infestations SOC (16.0% vs. 11.4%) and respiratory, thoracic, and mediastinal disorders SOC (8.0% 
vs. 4.0%).  
In the NSCLC group, grade 3-4 adverse events, grade 5 adverse events, serious adverse events, 
adverse events leading to treatment withdrawal, and adverse events leading to dose interruption were

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No formal studies investigating possible drug-drug interactions with atezolizumab have been conducted 
and thus no data are available. Atezolizumab is an antibody and is thus cleared principally by 
catabolism. Thus, atezolizumab is not expected to show pharmacokinetic interactions with other drugs.  
Atezolizumab enhances the immune response and concomitant administration of immuno-modulatory 
agents could result in pharmacodynamic interactions. Patients were excluded from atezolizumab 
clinical trials if they were administered immuno-modulatory products within 4 weeks prior to 
enrolment. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Overall, 148 (6.9%) of the All Patients Population experienced AEs leading to study treatment 
discontinuation, with a higher incidence in the All NSCLC Population (7.2%) compared to the All UC 
Population (5.7%).  By SOC, the most common AEs occurred within Respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders (1.5%), Infections and infestations (1.3%).

Table  109  Overview  of  frequency  and  reasons  for  study  treatment  discontinuation  (safety-evaluable 
patients) 
2.7.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety of Tecentriq is based on pooled data in 2,160 patients with metastatic UC (N=524) and 
NSCLC (N=1636). The number of patients included in the Pooled All Patients population (N=2160) and 
in each population based on malignancy is considered sufficient to evaluate the overall safety of 
atezolizumab in the population covered by the applied indications.  
Based on line of therapy, TC/IC status and/or cisplatin ineligibility/non-response, further sub-
populations were defined. As defining sub-populations divides the patients into multiple groups, some 
of these groups contain limited numbers of patients, making analyses of safety profiles in specific sub-
populations somewhat uncertain. The safety profiles in these sub-populations are thus primarily 
regarded as exploratory.  
All patients in the pivotal studies IMvigor 210, OAK, POPLAR, BIRCH, FIR and were exposed to the 
proposed dose. In the supportive study PCD4989g only 6 UC patients and no NSCLC patients were 
exposed to the proposed dose, albeit that a larger proportion may have been dosed close to the 
proposed dose. 86 patients from the UC Cohort and 26 patients from the NSCLC Cohort were dosed 15 
mg/kg every 3 weeks, equivalent to 1200 mg in patients weighing 80 kg. Further, 5 patients from the 
NSCLC Cohort were dosed 20 mg/kg every 3 weeks. Overall, it is considered that a sufficient number 
of patients were exposed to the proposed dose to document safety in the posology applied for.  
The median duration of exposure to atezolizumab at the proposed dose in the All Patients population 
was 3.5 months. The median duration of safety follow-up in the All Patients population was 4.5 
months. At the time of data cut-off for each study, 63.6% of study participants in the All Patients had 
withdrawn from the study. The majority, representing 69.1%, discontinued due to progressive disease. 
The reasons for study withdrawal were consistent between the All UC and All NSCLC safety 
populations. From a safety perspective this is considered acceptable.

Safety profile 
By SOC, the most frequently reported AEs (≥20% of patients) belonged to General disorders and 
administration site conditions, GI-disorders, Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, 
Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, Metabolism and nutrition disorders, Infections and 
infestation, Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, Nervous system disorders, Investigations, Blood 
and lymphatic system disorders and Renal and urinary tract disorders. Incidences varied slightly 
between studies. 
The incidence of fatigue, urinary tract infection (UTI), oedema peripheral, abdominal pain, and 
haematuria was higher in the All UC population, whereas dyspnoea and cough were more frequent in 
the All NSCLC population, which are consistent with the underlying diseases. 
Overall, 66.5% of the patients in the All Patients Population had at least one AE that was considered by 
the investigator to be related to atezolizumab treatment. The most common adverse reactions (any 
grade) were fatigue (35.4%), decreased appetite (25.5%), nausea (22.9%), dyspnoea (21.8%), 
diarrhoea (18.6%), rash (18.6%), pyrexia (18.3%), vomiting (15.0%), arthralgia (14.2%), asthenia 
(13.8%) and pruritus (11.3%). 
SAEs occurred in 38.5% of patients (All patients); 44.7% in the All UC and 36.6% in the All NSCLC 
populations. The most common SAEs were pneumonia, dyspnoea and pyrexia in the All NSCLC, while 
in the All UC population the most common SAEs were urinary tract infection, sepsis and haematuria. 
Treatment-related SAEs reported in 4 or more patients (≥0.3%) were pneumonitis (1.0%), pyrexia 
(0.8%), diarrhoea (0.6%), colitis, nausea, AST increased (0.4% each), pneumonia, ALT increased, 
hypothyroidism and muscular weakness (0.3% each). Treatment-related SAEs were reported in 9.4% 
of patients in the ‘All Patients population’.  
The majority of deaths occurred beyond 30 days after last dose (80.7% [1007/1248]). The most 
common reason for death was progression of the underlying disease, which accounted for 85.1% 
(1062/1248) of all deaths.  
AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation were experienced by 6.9% of the All Patients Population 
experienced. By Population, AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation occurred with higher 
incidence in the All NSCLC Population (7.2%) compared to the All UC Population (5.7%). This was 
primarily driven by AEs of pneumonitis, dyspnoea, pneumonia aspiration and pneumonia. However, 
based on the provided safety data there is no indication of increased risk of NSCLC patients having to 
discontinue treatment due to pulmonary adverse events caused by atezolizumab, as most events could 
be attributed to the underlying disease. 
Treatment with atezolizumab should continue until the patient no longer experiences clinical benefit or 
until development of unacceptable toxicity.  Long-term use is considered as missing information in the 
RMP and will be further investigated post-marketing in previously treated NSCLC patients and in 
patients with locally advance or metastatic urothelial or non-urothelial carcinoma of the urinary tract. 
Immune-related events 
Immune-related AEs are considered the key risk with the class of immune checkpoint inhibitors that 
target the PD-1/PD-L1 or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen signalling pathway. Accordingly, a subset of 
important immune-related events of particular clinical relevance were identified as important ADRs, 
which include hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, pneumonitis, colitis, hyperthyroidism, pancreatitis, 
hepatitis, non-infectious meningoencephalitis, adrenal insufficiency, myasthenic syndrome and 
Guillain-Barré syndrome and hypophysitis. Of these, the majority was Grade 1 or 2, and the most 
commonly observed immune-related events were hypothyroidism and pneumonitis. At the clinical cut-
Assessment report  
EMA/153102/2018  
Page 176/205 
 
 
 
 
 
 
off dates for all studies included in the pooled analysis, no patients had AEs in the myasthenic 
syndrome SMQ, however, these events were observed in other clinical studies in the atezolizumab 
clinical development program. 
It was observed that the incidence of immune-related pneumonitis was systematically higher in the All 
NSCLC Population, with AEs of higher Grade as compared to the All UC Population. This may partly be 
explained by an increased baseline risk in NSCLC due to atezolizumab induced immunologic response 
to tumour and surroundings. This seems to be in line with the observed safety profile of other immune 
checkpoint inhibitors, where a difference is also observed in lung vs. non-lung patients. As the 
incidences were relatively small and comparable with other studies of similar immune therapies, the 
provided data is considered acceptable. Most immune-related adverse reactions occurring during 
treatment with atezolizumab were reversible with interruptions of atezolizumab and initiation of 
corticosteroids and/or supportive care. In total 78/549 patients (14.2%) were in need of systemic 
corticosteroids. Only a minor fraction of the patients (28 (1.3%)) had to discontinue treatment due to 
immune-related reactions, and approximately 101 (4.7%) patients had to have a dose interruption. 
Median time to onset differed from ADR to ADR and likewise with median time to resolution.   
Patients should be monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of the above listed immune-related 
events (Increase in ALT, AST or bilirubin levels, thyroid function, motor and sensory neuropathy, 
increase in serum amylase or lipase levels). For suspected immune-related adverse reactions, 
thorough evaluation to confirm aetiology or exclude other causes should be performed. Based on the 
severity of the adverse reaction, atezolizumab should be withheld and corticosteroids administered. 
Upon improvement to Grade ≤ 1, corticosteroid should be tapered over ≥ 1 month. Based on limited 
data from clinical studies in patients whose immune-related adverse reactions could not be controlled 
with systemic corticosteroid use, administration of other systemic immunosuppressants may be 
considered. Atezolizumab must be permanently discontinued for any Grade 3 immune-related adverse 
reaction that recurs and for any Grade 4 immune-related adverse reactions, except for 
endocrinopathies that are controlled with replacement hormones (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 of the 
SmPC). 
Treatment with atezolizumab should also be permanently discontinued if a treatment-related toxicity 
does not resolve to Grade 0 or Grade 1 within 12 weeks after adverse reaction onset date, or if a 
corticosteroid dose of > 10 mg prednisone or equivalent per day is required for treatment-related 
toxicity beyond 12 weeks after adverse reaction onset date (see section 4.2 and 4.4 of the SmPC). 
In the All Patients population, 308 patients (14.3%) treated with atezolizumab infusion-related 
reactions (IRRs)/hypersensitivity (type I).  Signs and symptoms of IRRs overlap with several very 
common atezolizumab ADRs, including chills, dyspnoea, hypotension, influenza-like illness, pyrexia, 
and rash.  The rate of all grade IRR AEs was similar between UC (13.0%) and NSCLC (14.7%) 
patients.  These events were mild and seldomly required systemic treatment. Hence, pre-treatment is 
not deemed necessary. The rate of infusion should be reduced or treatment should be interrupted in 
patients with Grade 1 or 2 infusion related reactions. Atezolizumab should be permanently 
discontinued in patients with Grade 3 or 4 infusion related reactions. Patients with Grade 1 or 2 
infusion-related reactions may continue to receive atezolizumab with close monitoring. 
All the above listed immune-related events are listed as important identified risk in the RMP.  In order 
to increase awareness and provide information concerning their signs and symptoms and how to 
manage them, an educational programme has been developed for healthcare professionals and 
patients, including Physician Information and Management Guidelines and a Patient Alert Card.

Other important pharmacological class effects for immune checkpoint inhibitors include immune-
related myositis, immune-related nephritis, immune-related severe cutaneous adverse reactions and 
immune-related vasculitis as well as ocular inflammatory toxicity. Currently there is insufficient 
evidence to confirm a causal association with atezolizumab use and these events and these remain 
important potential risk. 
Among the safety-evaluable patients with available post-treatment anti-therapeutic antibody status, 
39.1% (785/2007) developed ATA. Irrespective of the population, the incidences of Grade 5 AEs and 
AEs leading to treatment discontinuation were very low and comparable. With regard to Grade 3-4 
AEs, slightly more SAEs are observed in ATA-positive patients. Some numerical differences were 
observed in Grade 3-4 AEs (40.7% in ATA negative vs. 47.0% in ATA-positive patients), which was 
mainly driven by AEs reported in the Metabolism and nutrition disorders SOC and the decreased 
appetite within the Metabolism and nutrition disorders SOC in ATA-positive patients. The incidence of 
SAEs was also slightly higher in ATA-positive patients (40.5%) compared with ATA-negative patients 
(34.0%), but this difference was not driven by any specific SOC or individual AE preferred term. The 
development of ATA is considered a potential important risk in the risk management plan and is being 
further investigated in Study OAK and Study IMvigor 211 (see Risk Management Plan). 
Subgroup analysis 
  NSCLC 
With regard to histology in NSCLC, there are no major differences between the squamous and non-
squamous subpopulations. Also, there were no major or clinically relevant differences between TC1/2/3 
or IC1/2/3 and TC2/3 or IC2/3. Furthermore, when analysing safety data of patients expressing TC0 or 
IC0 for the docetaxel and atezolizumab treated patients of the OAK and POPLAR studies, the incidence 
of the various types of AEs was generally comparable to the ITT population meaning that quite 
consistently the incidence of the various types of AEs was lower in the atezolizumab arm as compared 
to the docetaxel arm.  
In study POPLAR, by adjusting for person-years at risk the applicant has demonstrated no increased 
incidence among the atezolizumab-treated patients for the majority of AEs. However, musculoskeletal 
pain and pneumonia occurred with a higher incidence among the atezolizumab-treated patients as 
compared to the docetaxel-treated patients. Low grade musculoskeletal pain has been considered an 
expected event with atezolizumab as part of a cluster of symptoms associated with influenza-like 
illness and is probably related to the mechanism of action of atezolizumab, which causes activation of 
the immune system, and subsequent release of inflammatory cytokines. Musculoskeletal pain is 
reported as commonly with other immunotherapy drugs such as nivolumab and pembrolizumab. The 
observed musculoskeletal pain in the studies of atezolizumab is acceptable and do not represent a new 
safety signal. Regarding the increased incidence of pneumonia in the docetaxel arm (10.6 vs 3.6%), 
there was no evidence showing that this was related to the also increased frequency of neutropenia in 
the same arm (12.6 vs 1.4%). There were no significant difference between the treatment arms in the 
OAK trial, hence, this finding is not of any major concern.  
Overall, atezolizumab had a favourable safety profile as compared to docetaxel in NSCLC patients. 
  UC 
Based on PD-L1 expression, the total number of the 1L UC All Comers population experiencing AEs was 
96.6% and the total number of 2L+UC All Comers population experiencing AEs was 95.8%. When 
dividing patients into subgroups based on IC0, IC1, IC1/2/3 or IC2/3 numerical differences were 
observed but the sample size was small in several of the subgroups and the differences were not 
considered clinically meaningful to draw conclusions based on the observed differences.  
Assessment report  
EMA/153102/2018  
Page 178/205 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based on top-line results, the overall safety experience in the atezolizumab arm of the ongoing Study 
IMvigor 211 study was consistent with its known safety profile in a single-agent setting and was similar 
across the PD-L1 expression subgroups. No new safety signals were identified. The safety results 
provided also demonstrated that atezolizumab was better tolerated than chemotherapy, with an 
incidence of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation or modification/interruption, treatment related 
Grade 3 or 4 AEs and treatment related SAEs lower in the atezolizumab treatment arm compared to 
chemotherapy and each subgroups of chemotherapy regimen (vinflunine or taxanes). Subgroup 
analyses of safety by chemotherapy regimen (vinflunine vs. taxanes) showed a better toxicity profile of 
taxanes compared to vinflunine. This is considered relevant in the context of the different OS results 
according to the chemotherapy subgroup (OS HR 0.75 [95%CI: 0.60, 0.94] for atezolizumab compared 
with taxanes; HR 0.92 [0.75, 1.13] for the comparison of atezolizumab with vinflunine).  
The baseline and prognostic disease characteristics of the IMvigor210 Cohort 1 study population were 
overall comparable to patients in the clinic who would be considered cisplatin ineligible but would be 
eligible for a carboplatin-based combination chemotherapy. There are insufficient data for the subgroup 
of patients that would be unfit for any chemotherapy; therefore atezolizumab should be used with 
caution in these patients, after careful consideration of the potential balance of risks and benefits on an 
individual basis. Use of atezolizumab in previously untreated patients with urothelial carcinoma who 
are considered unfit for chemotherapy are also considered missing information and will be further 
investigated post-marketing. 
Safety in special populations 
Overall, in the All Patients Population, there was no noteworthy difference in the safety profile of 
atezolizumab based on age (65 years vs 65 years). No data are available with regard to the safety 
profile of Tecentriq in children and adolescents aged below 18 years. A Phase I/II, open-label study in 
paediatric and young adult patients with previously treated solid tumors is ongoing to evaluate the 
safety and tolerability of atezolizumab in this patient population. 
Nearly twice as many male as female study participants were included in the All Patients population. 
Nevertheless, the total number included in each gender subgroup is considered sufficient to provide for 
meaningful analyses. The total number of patients experiencing an AE was approximately 95% 
depending on subgroup although the incidence was slightly lower in the female All UC subgroup and 
slightly higher in the female All NSCLC subgroup. With regard to SAEs, AEs leading to dose interruption 
and AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation, the incidences were systematically higher among 
the male subgroups. However no difference was noted regarding the SOC. 
The majority of study participants were Caucasian. Due to the imbalance in race, no meaningful 
conclusions could be drawn from the analyses of safety by race. The majority of the patients were from 
North America and Europe. While differences in the incidence of adverse events across regions were 
noted, with lower Grade 3-4 and SAEs in Asian patients, no individual SOCs or PTs were noted to 
account for these regional differences and these findings were not considered clinically significant. 
No data are available in patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment and data in patients with 
severe renal impairment are limited. 
No data are available regarding the safety profile with regard to overdose, drug abuse, withdrawal and 
rebound or effects on ability to operate machinery or impairment of mental ability.  
In case of overdose, patients should be closely monitored for signs or symptoms of adverse reactions, 
and appropriate symptomatic treatment instituted (see section 4.9 of the SmPC). 
Assessment report  
EMA/153102/2018  
Page 179/205 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients experiencing fatigue should be advised not to drive and use machines until symptoms abate 
(see sections 4.7 and 4.8 of the SmPC) 
Also, no data regarding pregnancy or lactation were available at the cut-off date. However preclinical 
data suggest that PD-L1 has a role in establishing maternal/foetal tolerance. Therefore, women of 
childbearing potential have to use effective contraception during and for 5 months after treatment with 
atezolizumab, and atezolizumab should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of 
the woman requires treatment with atezolizumab. No data regarding possible excretion of 
atezolizumab in human milk are available and a risk to newborns/infants cannot be excluded (see 
Section 4.6 of the SmPC).  No clinical data are either available on the possible effects of atezolizumab 
on fertility. No reproductive and development toxicity studies have been conducted with atezolizumab. 
Hypersensitivity to atezolizumab or to any of the excipients was an exclusion criterion in atezolizumab 
clinical trial programme. Atezolizumab is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to 
atezolizumab or to any of the excipients. Other exclusion criteria included history of active autoimmune 
disease, concomitant use with other immuno-modulatory agents, concomitant treatment with systemic 
corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive medications, patients with history of severe reactions to 
immune checkpoint inhibitors, pre-existing viral or bacterial infection, concomitant administration of 
live attenuated vaccine, all of which are listed as missing information in the RMP. 
No data are available on concomitant or sequential use of atezolizumab with intra-vesical bacillus 
Calmette-Guérin vaccine for the treatment of urothelial carcinoma. Safety of atezolizumab 
administered with BCG will be investigated post-marketing. This is reflected in the RMP. 
2.7.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Based on the assessment of the currently submitted data, the size of the All Patients Population as well 
as the size of the All UC Population and All NSCLC Population, respectively, is considered sufficient to 
evaluate the safety profile. The majority of patients were exposed to the proposed dose and follow-up 
time is regarded sufficient.  
The ADRs reported for patients being treated with atezolizumab appear to be mostly of low grade and 
manageable, and the overall safety profile of atezolizumab is similar to that of other immune 
checkpoint inhibitors targeting the PD-1/PD-L1 signalling pathway.  
It was noted that immunological ADRs include hepatitis, pneumonitis, colitis, pancreatitis, 
endocrinopathies, neuropathies, and meningoencephalitis. These are managed appropriately with the 
recommendations as stated in the SmPC section 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8 and are also addressed in the RMP. 
However, in order to raise awareness of health care professionals, patients and/or their caregivers 
about the potential for immune-related adverse events and infusion-related reactions, which are 
considered important identified risks, the CHMP has imposed an educational programme for both 
healthcare professionals and patients to help on the identification and detection of the signs and 
symptoms relevant to the early recognition/identification of those ADRs.  
In conclusion, the CHMP considers that the safety and tolerability of atezolizumab has been described 
appropriately and is acceptable.

2.9.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 18.05.2016. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.10.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that atezolizumab has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in 
the European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers atezolizumab to be a new active substance as it is 
not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.11.  Product information 
2.11.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.11.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Tecentriq (atezolizumab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not 
contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance NSCLC indication 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Tecentriq as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after prior chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR activating 
mutations or ALK-positive tumour mutations should also have received targeted therapy before 
receiving Tecentriq. 
The aim of the therapy with atezolizumab is to prolong survival in patients with NSCLC that have failed 
on prior chemotherapy. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide in men and the second leading 
cause of cancer deaths worldwide in women. More than half of the patients with NSCLC are diagnosed 
with distant metastatic disease, which directly contributes to poor survival prospects. Thus, there is an 
unmet medical need for these patients, which are otherwise faced with a dismal prognosis. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Data to support the application for atezolizumab monotherapy in patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic NSCLC after prior chemotherapy are derived from the pivotal Study OAK and four 
supportive Studies POPLAR, BIRCH, FIR and PCD4989g NSCLC Cohort. During the procedure the 
Applicant provided results from the OAK study.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Atezolizumab exerts direct anti-tumour activity in patients with NSCLC as demonstrated by OS rates in 
controlled Phase II and III studies POPLAR and OAK. Both studies met their primary endpoint. 
Statistically significant and clinically relevant results were demonstrated. The curves start separating at 
3 months and continue to stay separated throughout the follow-up period. The pivotal study OAK 
showed a median OS for atezolizumab of 13.8 months vs. 9.6 months for docetaxel and a HR of 0.73  
(95%CI: 0.62, 0.87, p<0.0003) for the overall population. 
The study POPLAR showed a median OS for atezolizumab of 12.6 months vs. 9.7 months for docetaxel 
and a HR of 0.73  (95%CI: 0.56, 0.80, p<0.0404) for the overall population. In the OAK study, both 
squamous and non-squamous histology subgroups, the TC3 or IC3, TC2/3 or IC2/3, TC1/2/3 or 
IC1/2/3, and TC0 and IC0 subgroups treated with atezolizumab showed OS improvement compared 
with patients treated with docetaxel. Across all PD-L1 expression subgroups defined by different TC or 
IC cut-offs, the point estimates of the HRs for OS were equal to or below 0.82. 
In the POPLAR study HRs for OS favoured atezolizumab, ranging from 0.49 (TC3 or IC3) to 0.54 
(TC2/3 or IC2/3) to 0.59 (TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3). In the TC0 and IC0 subgroup, OS was similar between 
atezolizumab and docetaxel (HR 1.04; 95% CI: [0.62, 1.75]). In the OAK study, both squamous and 
Assessment report  
EMA/153102/2018  
Page 188/205 
 
 
 
 
 
 
non-squamous histology subgroups, the TC3 or IC3, TC2/3 or IC2/3, TC1/2/3 or IC1/2/3, and TC0 and 
IC0 subgroups treated with atezolizumab showed OS improvement compared with patients treated 
with docetaxel. Across all PD-L1 expression subgroups defined by different TC or IC cut-offs, the point 
estimates of the HRs for OS were equal to or below 0.82. 
Response rates in the range of 17% to 27% are observed in cohort 2 and 3 (2L and 3L respectively) in 
the BIRCH study. Having in mind that previous studies with docetaxel in 2L setting have resulted in 
response rates of 7-11 %, the observed ORR with atezolizumab may be considered clinically 
meaningful. Compared to historical control rates, the results are also statistically highly significant. 
Atezolizumab demonstrated a prolonged duration of response (DOR) relative to docetaxel for subjects 
in the ITT population, consistent with the superior OS of atezolizumab relative to docetaxel. The 
median DOR (per RECIST v1.1) in responders was nearly doubled in the atezolizumab arm compared 
with the docetaxel arm (14.3 months atezolizumab, 95% CI: 11.6, NE, versus 7.2 months docetaxel; 
95% CI 5.6, 12.5). 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
N/A 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In general, atezolizumab had a favourable safety profile compared to docetaxel. Atezolizumab was 
overall well tolerated in a fragile patient population. However, increased incidences of musculoskeletal 
pain was observed in the atezolizumab arm of the OAK and POPLAR studies as compared to the 
docetaxel arm. 
Common AEs included hypersensitivity, immune-related AEs, decreased appetite, hypokalaemia, 
hyponatremia, hypotension, dyspnpnoea, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, colitisj , 
dysphagia, AST increased , ALT increased, arthralgia, musculoskeletal pain, pyrexia, fatigue, asthenia, 
infusion related reaction, influenza like illness, and chills. 
AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation were more frequent in the All NSCLC Population as 
compared to the All UC Population and this was primarily driven by AEs of pneumonitis, dyspnea, 
pneumonia aspiration and pneumonia, but these seems to related to the underlying disease and not 
atezolizumab. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
A range of immune-related AEs occur at a very low incidence among the All Patients Population. The 
safety profile of other compounds of the same class indicates that the underlying frequency of these 
AEs is expected to be low. However, due to the limited number of patients included in the five 
atezolizumab registration studies, it is considered difficult to draw solid conclusions regarding the exact 
frequency of the respective immune-related AEs. Hence, educational materials for health care 
professionals are proposed which aims to facilitate early recognition and intervention of the important 
immune-related risks. A study will be conducted in order to evaluate the effectiveness of HCP 
educational materials. Data from HCP surveys and reporting rates for the important identified immune 
related risks will be collected and analysed to evaluate effectiveness of the HCP brochure (see RMP 
section).  
Assessment report

The post-baseline incidence of treatment emergent ATA was 31.3% in the All Patients population. The 
overall incidences of Grade 3-4 AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to dose interruptions were higher in the 
ATA-positive population compared to the ATA-negative population (differences pronounced in the UC 
population). The development of ATA is considered a potential important risk in the risk management 
plan and is being further investigated in Study OAK (see Risk Management Plan). 
Nonetheless, in the OAK and POPLAR studies the overall safety profile of atezolizumab compares 
favourably with docetaxel.

clinically significant.  
With regard to safety, immune-related AEs are considered the key risk with the class of immune 
checkpoint inhibitors that target the PD-1/PD-L1 or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen signaling pathway. 
A range of immune-related AEs occur at a very low incidence among the All Patients Population. The 
safety profile of other compounds of the same class indicates that the underlying frequency of these 
AEs is expected to be low. Direct comparison of safety in the POPLAR and OAK studies compares 
favourable for atezolizumab compared to docetaxel. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
A high unmet medical need for locally advanced and metastatic patients with non-small cell lung 
cancer is acknowledged. Statistically significant and clinically meaningfull results have been 
demonstrated. The safety profile is considered acceptable, despite some uncertainty about immune-
related AEs occurring at a very low incidence among the All Patients Population. Overall, the balance of 
benefits and risks is considered favourable. 
The overall treatment effect is consistently observed across TC and IC subgroups. The effect of 
atezolizumab in the so-called PD-L1 negative patients (TC0 or IC0) is considered clinically relevant 
based on the direct comparison with docetaxel in the POPLAR and OAK studies. Taken together the 
overall results of the OAK, BIRCH and POPLAR studies are clinically meaningful and welcomed in this 
patient population with a dismal prognosis. These results are further supported by two supportive 
studies.

metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) after prior platinum-containing chemotherapy or who are 
considered cisplatin ineligible. 
4.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
The overall 5-year survival rate for patients diagnosed with metastatic UC is approximately 5.5% 
(Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results [SEER] 2015). Poor prognostic factors for survival in

patients with metastatic UC include advanced stage of disease at the time of initial diagnosis, 
Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) <80%, and visceral metastasis (i.e., lung, liver, or bone; Bajorin 
et al. 1999). 
First-line Treatment for Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma 
Cisplatin-based chemotherapy is the preferred 1L therapy and has been shown to improve survival in 
patients with previously untreated metastatic UC (Loehrer et al. 1992; von der Maase et al. 2005). 
Cisplatin and gemcitabine (in combination with cisplatin; European Union only) are approved for 1L 
therapy; however, there are currently no approved 1L therapies for patients who have a 
contraindication to cisplatin or who are otherwise medically unfit for a cisplatin-based regimen. 
The ESMO guidelines (Bellmunt et al. 2014) recommend use of carboplatin-based regimens or single 
agents (taxane, gemcitabine) for cisplatin ineligible patients and BSC or inclusion in a clinical study for 
patients with PS >=2 and poor renal function. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
guidelines (2015) recommend participation in clinical studies or carboplatin- or taxane-based 
regimens, based on 2B level of evidence. 
Second-Line Treatment for Metastatic Urothelial Carcinoma 
Despite the efficacy of 1L regimens for patients treated with cisplatin-based regimens, responses 
showed limited durability, with nearly all patients experiencing disease progression. There is currently 
only one approved 2L therapy in the European Union (vinflunine). The approval of vinflunine was based 
on data from a single randomized Phase III study that compared vinflunine plus BSC with BSC alone in 
370 patients with advanced UC progressing after a platinum-containing therapy. Taxanes (paclitaxel 
and docetaxel) are commonly used as 2L therapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic UC.  
4.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Data to support the application for atezolizumab monotherapy in patients with locally advanced or 
metastatic UC or who are considered cisplatin ineligible are derived primarily from two studies: Pivotal 
Phase II Study IMvigor 210 and a supportive Phase Ia Study (PCD4989g). During the procedure the 
applicant also provided topline results from the phase III IMvigor 211 study.  
4.2.  Favourable effects 
Study IMvigor 210 and 211 showed durable responses supported by OS data in 2L patients. Durable 
responses are also shown in 1L cisplatin-ineligible patients, please see effects table.  
4.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Cohort 1: 1L cisplatin ineligible:  
The evidence for the benefit of atezolizumab for patients with previously untreated cisplatin-ineligible 
metastatic urothelial carcinoma is based on a single non-randomized study that enrolled 119 patients 
with ORR as primary endpoint. The non-randomized trial design in this submission is considered a large 
drawback, since comparisons of time-related endpoints and prognostic characteristics of study 
populations are associated with uncertainties. In order to further evaluate the efficacy of Tecentriq and 
provide further confirmation of the efficacy assumptions in 1L UC patients, the applicant should submit 
the results of IMvigor 130, a Phase III randomized study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of

Atezolizumab monotherapy vs. Atezolizumab and carboplatin/gemcitabine or cisplatin/gemcitabine in 
cisplatin-ineligible and –eligible patients.  
Cohort 2: 2L+  
Study IMvigor 211 did not demonstrate statistical significance in the primary OS analysis (which is 
partly attributed to hierarchical testing order with first test in the IC2/3 subgroup and the fact that PD-
L1 expression proved to be rather of prognostic than of predictive value in this data set). OS data for 
atezolizumab were numerically superior to SOC. “Explorative” p-value for the overall population was 
0.0378, meaning that a different study design with a primary testing in the overall study population 
would have led to a statistically significant outcome. The Kaplan-Meier OS curves showed a separation 
after approximately 7 months in favour of the atezolizumab arm, which was maintained thereafter. 
Subgroup analyses suggest a different treatment effect according to chemotherapy subgroups (OS HR 
0.75 [95%CI: 0.60, 0.94] for atezolizumab compared with taxanes; HR 0.92 [0.75, 1.13] for the 
comparison of atezolizumab with vinflunine). However OS for atezolizumab was not inferior compared 
to vinflunine (the only approved drug in this disease setting) and for the BR-balance with regards to 
vinflunine the unfavourable toxicity profile of vinflunine has to be taken into account that provides an 
even larger advantage of atezolizumab from the safety perspective. 
Confirmed ORRs are 13.4% in both treatment arms, but a higher proportion of patients had stable 
disease in the chemotherapy arm compared with the atezolizumab arm (35.1% vs. 19.9%). This 
suggests that   the proportion of patients that clearly benefit from atezolizumab monotherapy is small 
in 2L UC.   The Kaplan-Meier OS curves initially showed a favourable treatment effect for the control 
arm.  Retrospective analyses could not identify characteristics to select a patient population with lower 
likelihood to benefit from atezolizumab. 
Study IMvigor 211 resolved the concerns of a lower treatment effect of atezolizumab in subjects with 
lower PD-L1 expression subgroups (HR for OS 0.85 for all comers and 0.82 - 0.87 across all IC 
subgroups). Higher PD-L1 expression was associated with better efficacy results for atezolizumab. 
However the same association was also demonstrated for the control arm. 
In order to further evaluate the efficacy of Tecentriq and provide further confirmation of the efficacy 
assumptions in 1L and 2L UC, the applicant should submit the final results of study IMvigor 211 and 
study IMvigor 210.  
Finally, the applicant is recommended to provide a “biomarker analysis plan” with timelines and should 
submit the results of all ongoing and planned biomarker analyses post-approval. 
4.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Atezolizumab was overall well tolerated in a fragile patient population. Increased incidences of urinary 
tract infection and haematuria are observed in the All UC Cohort as compared to the All NSCLC Cohort, 
but this related to the underlying disease.  
AEs leading to study treatment discontinuation were more frequent in the All NSCLC Population as 
compared to the All UC Population and this was primarily driven by AEs of pneumonitis, dyspnea, 
pneumonia aspiration and pneumonia.  
Assessment report  
EMA/153102/2018  
Page 193/205 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Immune-related pneumonitis occurred with systematically higher incidence in the All NSCLC Population 
as compared to the All UC Population. Further, the events were generally of higher Grades. This may 
partly be explained by an increased baseline risk in NSCLC due to atezolizumab induced immunologic 
response to tumour and surroundings. This seems to be in line with the observed safety profile of other 
immune check point inhibitors, where a difference is also observed in lung vs. non-lung patients.  
4.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
A range of immune-related AEs occur at a very low incidence among the All Patients Population. The 
safety profile of other compounds of the same class indicates that the underlying frequency of these 
AEs is expected to be low. However, due to the limited number of patients included in the five 
atezolizumab registration studies, it is not possible to draw solid conclusions regarding the exact 
frequency of the respective immune-related AEs. Hence, educational materials for health care 
professionals are proposed which aims to facilitate early recognition and intervention of the important 
immune-related risks. A study will be conducted in order to evaluate the effectiveness of HCP 
educational materials. Data from HCP surveys and reporting rates for the important identified immune 
related risks will be collected and analysed to evaluate effectiveness of the HCP brochure. 
The post-baseline incidence of treatment emergent ATA was 31.3% in the All Patients population. The 
overall incidences of Grade 3-4 AEs, SAEs and AEs leading to dose interruptions were higher in the 
ATA-positive population compared to the ATA-negative population (differences pronounced in the UC 
population). The development of ATA is considered a potential important risk in the risk management 
plan and is being further investigated in Study IMvigor 211 (see Risk Management Plan).

4.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
4.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
2L+: 
Response rates in the same range as for chemotherapy have been demonstrated consistently in 767 2L 
UC patients across IMvigor 210 and IMvigor 211. Duration of responses was substantially longer for 
treatment with atezolizumab in study IMvigor 211 (median DOR 21.7 vs. 7.4 months in the 
atezolizumab vs. control arm). OS data for atezolizumab were numerically superior to SOC for the 
overall study population and across all IC subgroups. The Kaplan-Meier OS curves showed a separation 
after approximately 7 months in favour of the atezolizumab arm, which was maintained thereafter 
suggesting a non-negligible clinical benefit for those patients achieving a response. IMvigor 211 
confirmed the safety data of IMvigor 210 and demonstrated a better toxicity profile of atezolizumab 
compared to SOC chemotherapy. Thus given the efficacy considered at least non-inferior and the 
superior safety profile, atezolizumab could be considered an acceptable alternative treatment option in 
view of the unmet medical need in this setting.   
1L cisplatin ineligible: 
Although overall response rates of atezolizumab compare less favourably to the best historical 
comparator of CarboGem (22.7% vs. 36.1%), responses were ongoing in 70% of patients with a 
median follow-up of 17.2 months (compared to 5.3 months for Carbo/Gem). Considering the totality of 
evidence from different lines of therapy and in different diseases, the efficacy of atezolizumab in 1L 
cisplatin ineligible patients is considered established. 
The safety profile of atezolizumab in Cohort 1 was consistent with that derived from 2L UC and 2L 
NSCLC (including over 2500 patients). 
With regard to safety immune-related AEs are considered the key risk with the class of immune 
checkpoint inhibitors that target the PD-1/PD-L1 or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen signaling pathway. 
A range of immune-related AEs occur at a very low incidence among the All Patients Population.   
The safety data as provided in two large randomized phase III trials (OAK and IMvigor 211) 
demonstrated a more favourable profile for atezolizumab compared to SOC chemotherapy in UC. 
4.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Considering the sustained responses, the overall numerically favourable OS results in IMvigor 211 and 
the better safety profile of atezolizumab compared to SOC chemotherapy, atezolizumab is considered 
an acceptable alternative treatment option in the 2L+ setting.  
Additionally it is of importance that Study IMvigor 211 results are interpreted in context with data from 
other checkpoint inhibitors in the same indication, namely for nivolumab (single arm study CA209275: 
ORR 20%, median duration of response 10.4 months, median PFS 2.0 and median OS 8.6 months, J. 
Bellmunt et al, NEJM, February 17, 2017) and pembrolizumab (KN-045: ORR 21.1% vs. 11.4% for 
pembrolizumab vs. chemotherapy control, median OS 10.3 vs. 7.4 months [HR 0.73; p=0.002], 
median PFS 2.1 vs. 3.3 months). The results of all 2L UC studies with PD1/PDL1 checkpoint inhibitors 
are to a greater or lesser extent comparable.  
Assessment report  
EMA/153102/2018  
Page 196/205 
 
 
 
 
 
 
With regard to the 1L setting, the benefit-risk profile of atezolizumab in 1L UC is also considered 
positive.  Durable responses, promising OS data and a favourable safety profile has been 
demonstrated also in the 1L UC setting. Considering the totality of evidence from different lines of 
therapy and in different diseases, a positive B/R balance is confirmed.  
4.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
4.8.  Conclusions  
Based on the totality of the evidence, the benefit-risk balance of Tecentriq in 2nd line UC and in 1st line 
cisplatin-ineligible UC is considered positive.  
Divergent positions are appended to this report. 
5.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority 
decision that the risk-benefit balance of Tecentric is favourable in the following indications: 
 
Tecentriq as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced 
or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (UC) after prior platinum-containing chemotherapy or who 
are considered cisplatin ineligible. 
 
Tecentriq as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced 
or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after prior chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR 
activating mutations or ALK-positive tumour mutations should also have received targeted 
therapy before receiving Tecentriq. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use

Divergent Position 
The undersigned members of CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s opinion recommending the granting 
of a Marketing Authorisation for Tecentriq. 
The reasons for divergent opinion were as follows: 
Current evidence on efficacy and safety in first-line cisplatin-ineligible patients only comprises a single-
arm study (cohort 1 in study IMvigor210), where the response rate may be considered low. 
Comparison is made indirectly to CarboGem and does not allow concluding on an advantage for 
Tecentriq over CarboGem due to limitations related to indirect cross-trial comparison. Furthermore, 
efficacy outcomes of ORR and PFS are considered inferior to CarboGem. Although OS appears to be 
longer for Tecentriq compared to CarboGem and historical data, there are presently no available data 
from the ongoing, randomised comparative phase 3 study, IMvigor 130, in the first-line setting. The 
lack of direct comparative efficacy data with first line agents precludes a determination of the extent of 
any potential “loss of chance”. This is of particular importance as no biomarker or other factors to 
predict which patients may respond to Tecentriq in this setting have been identified. It is however 
acknowledged that responses to Tecentriq are more durable than what is seen with chemotherapy. 
Without data from the ongoing 1L phase 3 study (IMvigor130), the fate of those who do not respond to 
Tecentriq is not known.  
It is acknowledged that safety seems to be more favourable when compared to chemotherapy. 
In conclusion, the uncertainties in current data outweigh the favourable safety profile, and do not 
support approval in the overall cisplatin-ineligible population and an approval in this setting could 
deprive patients of an effective treatment option. Taken together, the benefit-risk balance is 
considered to be negative for this population. 
With regard to the second-line setting, currently evidence is based on a phase 2 single-arm study 
(cohort 2 in IMvigor210) and the phase 3 study IMvigor 211. The design of study IMvigor 210 was 
based on several assumptions that were not confirmed by the phase 3 data. The observed response 
rates in IC2/3 in cohort 2 in study IMvigor 210 are not translated into a statistically significant 
difference in terms of OS in study IMvigor 211. The favourable safety profile of atezolizumab does not 
outweigh the uncertainties related to the efficacy in this patient population.   
In conclusion, the effect of atezolizumab is demonstrated in the second-line setting in NSCLC, 
however, there are substantial uncertainties regarding the efficacy of atezolizumab for the treatment of 
adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma after prior chemotherapy or 
who are considered cisplatin ineligible, which are not outweighed by the likely favourable safety profile 
compared to available treatment options.

Divergent Position – Tecentriq (EMEA/H/C/4143/0000) 
The undersigned member of CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s opinion recommending the granting 
of a Marketing Authorisation for Tecentriq. 
The reasons for divergent opinion were as follows: 
Current evidence on efficacy and safety in first-line cisplatin-ineligible patients only comprises a single-
arm study (cohort 1 in study IMvigor210), where the response rate may be considered low. 
Comparison is made indirectly to CarboGem and does not allow concluding on an advantage for 
Tecentriq over CarboGem due to limitations related to indirect cross-trial comparison. Furthermore, 
efficacy outcomes of ORR and PFS are considered inferior to CarboGem. Although OS appears to be 
longer for Tecentriq compared to CarboGem and historical data, there are presently no available data 
from the ongoing, randomised comparative phase 3 study, IMvigor 130, in the first-line setting. The 
lack of direct comparative efficacy data with first line agents precludes a determination of the extent of 
any potential “loss of chance”. This is of particular importance as no biomarker or other factors to 
predict which patients may respond to Tecentriq in this setting have been identified. It is however 
acknowledged that responses to Tecentriq are more durable than what is seen with chemotherapy. 
Without data from the ongoing 1L phase 3 study (IMvigor130), the fate of those who do not respond to 
Tecentriq is not known.  
It is acknowledged that safety seems to be more favourable when compared to chemotherapy. 
In conclusion, the uncertainties in current data outweigh the favourable safety profile, and do not 
support approval in the overall cisplatin-ineligible population and an approval in this setting could 
deprive patients of an effective treatment option. Taken together, the benefit-risk balance is 
considered to be negative for this population.

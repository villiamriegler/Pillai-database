1.  Introduction 
On  06  June  2022,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  Fycompa  oral  suspension,  in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006,  as amended. 
Perampanel is a highly  selective non-competitive AMPA-type glutamate  receptor antagonist.  In the  EU, 
Fycompa  (perampanel), 
following  the  extension  of 
indication 
in  the  paediatric  population 
(EMEA/H/C/002434/II/0047),  is indicated for the adjunctive treatment of: 
- 
partial-onset seizures (POS) with  or without  secondarily generalised seizures in patients from 4 
years of age and older. 
- 
primary generalised tonic-clonic  (PGTC) seizures in patients  from 7 years of age and older with 
idiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE). 
Perampanel has  also been  approved as  monotherapy or adjunctive  therapy in  paediatric  patients  with 
POS aged  4  years and  older in  the  US as  of  September 2018.  The International  Birth  Date is  23  July 
2012 in the EU (via the centralized procedure). Perampanel is marketed under the trade name Fycompa 
and is available as 2-, 4-,  6-, 8-, 10-,  and 12-mg tablets and 0.5 mg/ml oral suspension. 
EISAI is hereby submitting final study results and report related to paediatric population for Study E2007-
G000-311  (referred to  as  Study 311).  This  study  311  is a required study  in  the  perampanel Paediatric 
Investigation Plan (PIP), EMEA-000467-PIP01-08-M015,  Study 9. Study 311 was a Phase 3, multicentre, 
open-label, single-arm study in children (aged 4 to <12 years) with inadequately controlled partial-onset 
seizures (POS)  or primary generalized tonic-clonic  seizures (PGTCS). The  study  enrolled 180  subjects 
(planned 160 subjects) and all subjects were treated with perampanel in the study. Of note, 146 subjects 
completed 
the  Core  Study,  of  which  136 
subjects  entered  Extension  A 
(refer 
to 
EMEA/H/C/002434/II/0047  extension of indication variation). And 53 subjects completed Extension A in 
Japan or France (those eligible to enrol in  Extension B), of which 43  subjects entered Extension B. 
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  perampanel  oral 
suspension as an adjunctive therapy in children (aged 4 to <12 years) with inadequately controlled POS 
or PGTCS. 
The Core and Extension  A data were already submitted  and  assessed in a  Type II variation, procedure 
EMEA\H\C\002434\II\0047,  to extend the approved indication for Fycompa to paediatric POS patients 4 
to  less than  12  years and  PGTC of IGE patients  7  to  less  than  12  years that  was approved on 10  Nov 
2020.  The Extension B data are now available and assessed in this submission. 
The submission of these final data is being made to the European Medicines Agency to fulfil the obligation 
to present data from any MAH-sponsored study in  a paediatric population.  
These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.

2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The investigational medicinal product tested in  Study 311  was Fycompa as 0.5 mg/ml oral suspension. 
Perampanel was orally administered once daily before bedtime. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The  MAH  submitted  a  final  report for  study  311,  multicentre,  open-label,  single-arm study  in  children 
(aged 4 to <12  years) with  inadequately controlled partial-onset seizures (POS) or primary generalized 
tonic-clonic seizures (PGTCS to evaluate the safety and tolerability of perampanel oral suspension as an 
adjunctive therapy. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Description 
The study  was  a Phase 3,  multicenter,  open-label, single-arm study  in  children (aged  4 to  <12  years) 
with  inadequately  controlled  POS  or  PGTCS.  Subjects  with  complex  partial  seizures  with  secondary 
generalization, ie, secondarily generalized tonic-clonic  seizures (SGTCS), were analyzed as a subset  of 
the  POS  cohort.  A  total  of  80  sites  were selected,  of  which  58  sites  enrolled subjects  in  Belgium  (2), 
France (5),  Hungary (4),  Japan (22),  Korea (1),  Latvia (1),  Poland (3), Spain (5),  and the  US (15).  No 
adult subjects participated in this  study. 
Subjects entered Extension B with their optimal perampanel dose (ie, the same dose of perampanel that 
they  were  maintained  on  at  the  end  of  Extension  A).  During  the  course  of  Extension  B,  doses  of 
perampanel and concomitant  antiepileptic  drugs (AEDs) could be adjusted (concomitant  AEDs could  be 
used in accordance with  the approved dosage and indication) based on clinical judgment. In Japan, the 
maximum dose of perampanel was 12 mg per day. In countries where an EAP could not be implemented, 
the maximum dose of perampanel was 12 mg per day in subjects not  taking any concomitant enzyme-
inducing antiepileptic  drugs (EIAEDs), or 16  mg per day in  subjects taking a concomitant EIAED. 
Tolerability at  a minimum  perampanel dose of  2 mg  per day was required to  continue  in the  program. 
Subjects who did not  tolerate the  minimum perampanel dose of 2  mg per day during the study  were to 
be discontinued from the  study. 
Conversion to monotherapy on perampanel was also permitted at the discretion of the investigator, if it 
was considered appropriate to control the seizures. 
The visit intervals in Extension B were every 12 weeks. All visits were to be done within ±6  days of the 
schedule. 
An overview of the study design (previous core study and extension A) is presented in Figure 1.

CHMP  comments: 
The total study duration of study 311 from 1st subject enrolled to last subject’s last visit/last assessment 
will be approximately 112 weeks (52 weeks of recruitment, up to 4 weeks ±3 days of Screening/Baseline, 
up  to 52  weeks  of treatment  [including  up to  an 11-week  Titration  Period, up to  12-week  Maintenance 
Period, and  up  to  29-week  Extension  Phase  (Extension  A)],  and  up  to  4  weeks  of  follow-up  [only  for 
those  subjects  not  entering  into  Extension  B]).  In  Japan,  4  weeks  ±3  days  of  baseline  is  required; 
however,  subjects  outside  of  Japan  may  begin  treatment  as  soon  as  baseline  procedures have  been 
completed and documentation  of eligibility  has been established. 
Extension Phase (Extension B) with  open-label treatment will  be available to  subjects enrolled in  Japan 
and  in  countries  where  an  extended  access  program  (EAP)  cannot  be  implemented,  after  having 
completed  Extension  A.  In  Japan,  participation  in  Extension  B  will  continue  as  long  as  clinically 
appropriate according to  the judgment  of the  investigator, until  the  subject reaches 12  years of age or 
perampanel is commercially available in Japan for treatment  of partial-onset seizures (POS) inpediatric 
subjects (4 to less than 12 years of age). In countries where an EAP cannot be implemented, participation 
in Extension B will continue as long as clinically appropriate according to the judgment of the investigator, 
until  the subject reaches 12 years of age or perampanel oral suspension is commercially available.

Overall the study 311 consisted of a Core Study and Extension A Phase for subjects globally as assessed 
during  the  EMEA/H/C/002434/II/0047  extension  of  indication  variation,  with  an  additional  open-label 
Extension  B  available  only  for  subjects  enrolled  in  Japan  and  in  countries  where  an  extended access 
program (EAP) could not be implemented after completion of Extension A.  
For  more  details  regarding  the  methodology  of  study  311,  refer  to  the  assessment  report  of 
EMEA/H/C/002434/II/0047  extension of indication  variation. 
This variation focused on data collected from subjects who entered Extension B, up  to time  of the data 
cutoff (30 Mar 2020). 
Methods 
Study participants 
To be eligible for Extension  B, subjects must  have resided in Japan  or in countries where an EAP could 
not  be  implemented, must  have completed  the  Core and Extension  A  of this  study,  were  less than  12 
years of  age  at  the  time  of  entering  Extension  B,  and  who,  in  the  opinion  of  the  investigator,  would 
continue to benefit from treatment with  perampanel. 
During Extension B, the duration of treatment was to continue as long as clinically appropriate according 
to  the judgment  of the  investigator. However, treatment  was to  be completed when  a subject reached 
12  years  of  age,  switched  to  the  commercial  perampanel  product,  or  discontinued  for  safety  or 
administrative reasons. 
Treatments 
Fycompa as 0.5 mg/ml  oral suspension were dosed orally once daily as per SmPC and standard clinical 
practice using  commercially available oral suspension. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the study  was to evaluate the long-term safety and tolerability of perampanel 
oral  suspension  when  administered  as  an  adjunctive  therapy  in  children  (aged  4  to  <12  years) with 
inadequately  controlled  partial-onset  seizures  (POS)  or  primary  generalized  tonic-clonic  seizures 
(PGTCS). 
There was no secondary objective for the Extension B of this study. 
Outcomes /endpoints 
For Extension B, only safety assessment. 
Adverse events 
AEs were coded using the MedDRA version 21.0 lower level term closest to the verbatim term. The linked 
MedDRA PT and primary SOC were also captured in the database. 
Only those AEs that occurred during Extension B for subjects in the Safety Analysis Set were included in 
summary tables.  
The incidence of TEAEs  were reported as the  number (percentage) of subjects with  TEAEs by  SOC and 
PT.  
The  number  (percentage) of  subjects  with  TEAEs  were  also summarized by  maximum  severity (mild, 
moderate, or severe).

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/795008/2022  
Page 6/21 
 
 
 
The  number (percentage) of  subjects with  TEAEs  were also summarized by  relationship to  study  drug 
(Yes [possibly related, probably related] and No [not related]). AEs were analyzed by the actual dose at 
AE onset.  
The number  (percentage) of subjects with  treatment-related TEAEs  were summarized by SOC and  PT. 
Treatment-related  TEAEs  included  those  events  considered by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  study 
drug. 
The number (percentage) of subjects with TEAEs leading to discontinuation from study drug, treatment-
emergent serious adverse events (SAEs) and TEAEs leading to death were summarized by MedDRA SOC 
and PT. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
A listing  of subjects  with  AEs related to  suicidality,  identified  by  the  depression and  suicide/self-injury 
Standardized MedDRA Query terms (SMQ), was provided. The TEAEs of special interest were summarized 
by SOC and PT. The SMQs were used to identify relevant terms for the following TEAEs: 
• TEAEs suggestive of abuse potential:  SMQ of drug abuse, dependence and withdrawal 
• TEAEs related to alertness and cognition: SMQ of dementia 
• TEAEs related to hostility/aggression: SMQ of hostility/aggression 
• TEAEs related to psychosis/psychotic disorders: SMQ of psychosis and psychotic disorders 
• TEAEs related to status  epilepticus/convulsions: SMQ of convulsions 
• TEAEs related to laboratory abnormalities: SMQ of drug-related hepatic disorders 
•  Cardiac  and  ECG  TEAEs:  SMQs  of  cardiac  arrhythmia  terms  (including  bradyarrhythmias  and 
tachyarrythmias,  arrhythmia 
related 
investigations,  signs  and  symptoms,  cardiac 
failure, 
cardiomyopathy, ischaemic heart disease, and Torsade de pointes/QT prolongation) 
• TEAEs related to rash: TEAEs related to rash were identified by medical review 
•  Falls,  regardless of causality,  were summarized for  the  Extension  B through  Follow-up  Period of  the 
Extension phase, by the actual dose at onset. 
Laboratory Values 
Laboratory results were summarized using SI units, as appropriate. For all quantitative parameters, the 
actual value and the change from baseline to each post baseline visit and to the end of treatment (defined 
as  the  last  on-treatment  value)  are  summarized  by  visit  using  descriptive  statistics.  Qualitative 
parameters were summarized using frequencies (number and percentage of subjects), and changes from 
baseline to each post baseline visit and to end of treatment were reported using shift tables.  
Vital Signs 
Descriptive  statistics  for  vital  signs  parameters  (ie,  systolic  and  diastolic  blood  pressure,  pulse, 
respiratory rate, temperature, weight)  and changes from baseline were presented by visit.  The number 
(percentage) of  subjects  with  clinically  notable  results over all  scheduled  and unscheduled  visits  were 
summarized. 
Sample size 
There was no sample size calculation.

Randomisation and  blinding (masking) 
No randomization and blinding are anticipated  for this  study.  
Statistical Methods 
All safety analyses were performed on the Safety Analysis Set.  
The Safety Analysis Set was defined as subjects who received at least 1 dose of perampanel and had at 
least 1 post-dose safety assessment in Extension B. 
Safety data were summarized using descriptive statistics (eg, n, mean, SD, median, minimum, maximum 
for continuous variables; n [%] for categorical variables).  
Safety  variables include  treatment-emergent  adverse events  (TEAEs),  clinical  laboratory parameters, 
vital signs, and weight.  Study Day 01 for all safety analyses was defined as the date of the first dose of 
study drug in the Core Study. 
For  completeness, subject  data  listings  include  cumulative  data  from Core  Study through  Extension A 
and Extension B for subjects who entered into  Extension B. 
Some data  of  5  subjects captured  in  the  electronic Case Report  Forms  (eCRFs) were  not  Source Data 
Verified  (SDV)  before  database  lock  (Table  1).  Due  to  the  coronavirus  disease  2019  (COVID-19) 
pandemic at  the time,  any non-urgent  visits at  study site  were not  allowed. These data  did not  have a 
significant  impact on the  overall study  objectives and endpoints,  and thus  it was  decided to  proceed to 
database lock without  SDV of the selected eCRF pages. 
All summaries were generated by disease cohort  (POS, SGTCS subset of POS, and PGTCS cohort),  age 
cohort (4  to <7  years and ≥7  to <12  years), and  inducer status (without  concomitant  EIAEDs and with 
concomitant EIAEDs). No summaries of subjects with IGE were produced since no subjects with IGE were 
enrolled in Extension B. 
All  analyses were conducted  only  for subjects who  have participated  in  the  Extension  B, with  baseline 
(before perampanel treatment initiation  in Core Study) data being included where appropriate. 
CHMP  comments: 
Taking  into  account  the  exceptional  circumstances  due  to  the  coronavirus  disease  2019  (COVID-19) 
pandemic  at  that  time,  the  decision  to  lock  the  database without  SDV  of  the  selected  eCRF  pages  of 
these 5 patients could be considered acceptable. 
Results 
Participant flow /recruitment 
Reminder  
•  Core study: 
Of the  208  subjects screened, 180  subjects were enrolled and treated in  the  Core Study  (149  subjects 
in the POS cohort and 31 subjects in the PGTCS cohort). All 180 subjects were in the Safety Analysis Set 
(SAS) and in the Full  Analysis Set (FAS). 
Within  the  SAS,  46  subjects  (POS:  40  and  PGTCS:  6)  were  in  the  4  to  <7  year age  group  and  134 
subjects (POS: 109  and PGTCS: 25)  were in the  ≥7 to  <12 year age group.

Page 8/21 
 
 
 
Of the  180  subjects enrolled and treated in  the  Core Study, 146  (81.1%)  subjects completed the  Core 
Study  (LSLV  was  20  Jul  2018).  The  main  reasons for  discontinuation  were  adverse events  (AEs)  (14 
[7.8%]  subjects),  subject  choice  (7  [3.9%]  subjects),  and  inadequate  therapeutic  effect  (8  [4.4%] 
subjects). 
• 
Extension A phase: 
Of the  146 subjects who  completed the Core Study,  136 subjects entered Extension A (116  subjects in 
the POS cohort and 20 subjects in the PGTCS cohort).  
Of the  136 subjects, 36  subjects (POS: 32  and PGTCS: 4)  were in the 4  to <7  year age group and 100 
subjects (POS: 84 and PGTCS: 16)  were in the ≥7 to <12  year age group. 
A total  of 122 (89.7%)  subjects completed Extension A (LSLV was  05 Feb 2019).  The main  reasons for 
discontinuation  of  perampanel  treatment  in  Extension  A  were  AEs  (5  [3.7%]  subjects),  inadequate 
therapeutic effect (4 [2.9%] subjects) and subject choice (3 [2.2%]  subjects). 
Patient disposition for Extension B: 
Of the  53  (100.0%)  subjects  who completed Extension  A in  Japan or France, 43  subjects  (81.1%)  (41 
subjects in  Japan  and 2  subjects in  France) entered Extension  B (42  subjects  in the  POS cohort  and 1 
subject in the PGTCS cohort). Of the 42 treated subjects, 11 subjects (all in the POS cohort) were in the 
4 to <7 year age group and 31  subjects (POS: 30  and PGTCS: 1) were in the ≥7 to <12 year age group.  
See table 2 for subject disposition  in the Extension B of study 311: 
CHMP  comments: 
A  total  of  122  (89.7%)  subjects  completed  Extension  A  phase  considering  all  concerned  countries: 
Belgium, France, Hungary, Japan, Korea, Latvia, Poland, Spain and the US. 
The  Extension  B  involves  subjects  who  completed  Extension  A  phase  only  in  Japan  or  France  (53 
subjects) and therefore implies a reduced proportion of those who overall completed Extension A phase.

Of the 42 treated subjects, 36 (85.7%) subjects completed Extension B as of data cut-off date of 30 Mar 
2020.  Five  (11.9%)  subjects  were  withdrawn  early  from  Extension  B.  The  main  reasons  for 
discontinuation  of  perampanel treatment  in  Extension B  were inadequate therapeutic  effect  (3  [7.1%] 
subjects), subject choice (1 [2.4%]  subject) and other reasons (1 [2.4%] subject).  
One subject in  France (Subject  15061002;  POS cohort,  4 to  <7  years old  without-concomitant-EIAEDs  
cohort) was ongoing in the study at the time of data cut-off. This last subject completed the study on 06 
Dec 2021. 
One subject  was 12  years old  just  when he completed Extension  A and entered Extension  B, and  thus 
was switched to commercial Fycompa and did not  receive study drug in Extension B. 
Baseline  data   
The  main  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  by  disease  cohort  during  the  Extension  B  are 
displayed in Table 3.

CHMP  comments: 
Of the 42 treated subjects in Extension B, there were 22  (52.4%) female subjects and 20 (47.6%)  male 
subjects. The majority of the subjects was Japanese (40 subjects). The mean (SD) values of age, weight, 
and  body  mass  index  (BMI)  were  7.8  (1.80)  years,  22.68  (6.313)  kg,  and  15.13  (2.383)  kg/m2, 
respectively. The median time since diagnosis was 6.355  years. 
Regarding the concomitant  AED,  a protocol amendment had changed the inclusion/exclusion criteria to 
increase the maximum number of approved AEDs from 2 to  3 to improve subjects’ enrolment. 
Extent  of exposure 
In Extension B Safety Analysis Set (N=42),  across the disease cohorts, the median (range) duration  of 
exposure was 63.0  (9 to 89)  weeks and the mean (SD) duration of exposure was 55.9  (24.38) weeks.

The mean (SD) of mean daily dose of perampanel was 7.8 (2.70) mg/day. The mean (SD) of mean daily 
dose of perampanel by disease cohorts were: POS –  7.8  (2.74)  mg/day, SGTCS –  7.5  (3.27)  mg/day, 
and PGTCS –  8.0  (NA) mg/day and  by age cohorts: 4  to  <7  years – 6.7  (2.78)  mg/day and  ≥7 to  <12 
years  –   8.2  (2.62)  mg/day.  When  analyzed  across  the  concomitant  EIAEDs  cohorts,  the  mean 
perampanel dose appeared to be similar in subjects in the with-concomitant-EIAEDs cohort (mean [SD] 
daily  dose  7.6  [3.19]  mg/day;  maximum  dose  received 9.0  [3.46]  mg/day),  relative  to  those  in  the 
without-concomitant-EIAEDs  cohort  (mean daily dose 7.8  [2.70]  mg/day; maximum dose received 8.4 
[2.90]  mg/day). 
CHMP  comments: 
The majority (≥70%)  of subjects who  entered Extension B  had cumulative exposure to perampanel for 
more than  100  weeks:  29  [70.7%]  subjects in  the  POS cohort, 15  [68.2%]  subjects in  SGTCS cohort, 
and  1  [100.0%]  subject  in  the  PGTCS  cohort  from  study  drug  treatment  initiation  through  end  of 
treatment in Extension B.  
The overall median duration of exposure was 116.7  weeks (range: 59  – 141  weeks), which  was similar 
across disease cohorts (POS: 116.1  weeks,  SGTCS: 114.0  weeks, and  PGTCS: 120.6  weeks), between 
the  two  age  cohorts  (4  to  <7  years: 124.0  weeks  and ≥7  to  <12  years: 116.0  weeks),  and  between 
subjects with or without  concomitant EIAEDs  (123.9 weeks and 116.1  weeks, respectively). 
Overall, based on  the  cumulative data  throughout  the  Core  Study,  Extension  A, and  Extension  B,  the 
average (SD)  of  the mean  daily dose of perampanel was 7.5  (2.27)  mg/day,  which  was similar across 
disease cohorts  (POS: 7.4 [2.30]  mg/day, SGTCS: 7.4  [2.78]  mg/day, and  PGTCS: 7.9  [NA]  mg/day), 
between the two  age cohorts (4 to <7  years: 7.1 [2.01]  mg/day, ≥7 to <12  years: 7.6 [2.37]  mg/day), 
and between subjects with  or without  concomitant EIAEDs  (7.5 [1.66]  mg/day and 7.5  [2.34]  mg/day, 
respectively). 
Efficacy results 
No efficacy evaluations were performed during Extension B. 
CHMP  comments: 
In study 311, efficacy was a secondary objective as measured by the median percent change in seizure 
frequency per 28  days, responder rates (≥25%, ≥50%, ≥75%)  and seizure-free rate, and CGIC.  
For  the  Core Study,  efficacy analyses were performed  using  the  FAS  (N=180  subjects)  including  data

Extension B 
•  Overview  of Adverse Events 
The AEs are presented Table 4 below for subjects in  the Extension B Safety Analysis Set: 
Overall in Extension B, 35 (83.3%)  subjects experienced TEAEs: 34 (82.9%)  subjects in the POS cohort, 
including  17  (77.3%)  subjects in  the  SGTCS subset of  the  POS cohort, and  1  (100.0%)  subject in  the 
PGTCS cohort. TEAEs were reported for 10 (90.9%) subjects in the 4 to <7 years cohort and 25 (80.6%) 
subjects  in  the  ≥7  to  <12  years cohort;  and  for  3  (75.0%)  subjects  in  the  with-concomitant-EIAEDs 
cohort and 32 (84.2%)  subjects in  the without-concomitant-EIAEDs  cohort. 
-  Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events by Severity  
The  majority of subjects  experienced TEAEs  that  were either  mild  (14  [33.3%]  subjects)  or moderate 
(15  [35.7%]  subjects)  in  severity. Overall, 6  (14.3%)  subjects had  severe TEAEs: 6  (14.6%)  subjects 
in the POS cohort, including 2 (9.1%) subjects in the SGTCS subset of the POS cohort. No severe TEAEs 
were reported in the PGTCS cohort. Of the 6 subjects with severe TEAEs, 1 (9.1%) subject was in the 4 
to <7  years age cohort and 5 (16.1%)  subjects were in ≥7 to <12  years age cohort.

CHMP  comments: 
Most  severe TEAE  were  related to  infections  and  infestations or  respiratory, thoracic  and  mediastinal 
disorders MedDRA SOC. 
-  Treatment-related TEAEs  
The majority of TEAEs reported were deemed not related to perampanel. Treatment-related TEAEs were 
reported  for  6  (14.3%)  subjects  overall:  5  (12.2%)  subjects  in  the  POS  cohort,  including  3  (13.6%) 
subjects in the SGTCS subset of the POS cohort, and 1 (100.0%)  subject in the PGTCS cohort. Of the 6 
subjects  with  treatment-related  TEAEs,  1  (9.1%)  subject  was  in  the  4  to  <7  years age  cohort  and  5 
(16.1%)  subjects were in ≥7 to <12 years age cohort. 
CHMP  comments: 
The treatment-related TEAEs included  1 yellow skin  in  a subject of the  4 to  <7  years age cohort and 1 
dysphagia, 1 DILI, 1 GGT increased, 1 headache and 1 somnolence in one subject each of the ≥7 to <12 
years age cohort. 
-  Death and other major issues 
No TEAEs leading to death, life-threatening situations,  persistent or significant disability or incapacity or 
important medical events were reported during the study. 
-  SAE 
A total  of 8  (19.0%)  subjects  (8  [19.5%]  subjects  in  the  POS cohort,  including  4  [18.2%]  subjects in 
the SGTCS subset of the POS cohort) experienced treatment-emergent SAEs. Treatment-emergent SAEs 
were not  reported for the  subject  in  the  PGTCS cohort.  None  of the  SAEs reported during  Extension B 
were assessed by the investigator as related to study drug.

CHMP  comments: 
None of  the 8  SAEs (enterocolitis, bronchitis,  lower respiratory tract infection,  pharyngitis,  pneumonia, 
pyelonephritis acute, pneumonia aspiration, upper respiratory tract inflammation, subgaleal haematoma) 
reported during Extension  B was  assessed by the  investigator as related to  study  drug. All  occurred in 
the POS cohort and none in the PGTCS cohort.  
-  TEAEs Leading to Discontinuation 
No subject in Extension B discontinued the study drug due to a TEAE. 
-  TEAEs Requiring Interruption,  Dose Reduction of Perampanel or withdrawal 
Overall, TEAEs leading to dose reduction were reported by 2 (4.8%) subjects (both in the SGTCS subset 
of the POS cohort). Both subjects were in the ≥7 to <12 years and without-concomitant-EIAEDs cohorts. 
There were no subjects with  TEAEs that led to dose interruption, dose increase or withdrawal. 
•  Common Treatment-Emergent  Adverse Events 
Common TEAEs (in at least 10% of subjects in any disease cohort) are summarized by MedDRA (Version 
21.0)  SOC and PT in  Table 5 below:  
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

CHMP  comments:  
Most frequently reported TEAEs that occurred in more than 10% of subjects overall were nasopharyngitis, 
influenza,  pneumonia,  and vomiting.  None  of  these  TEAE  observed in  at  least  10%  of  subjects  in  any 
disease cohort are stated in the SmPC of Fycompa and are considered treatment related.  
•  Analysis of Adverse Events 
-  Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Suggestive of Abuse Potential 
No TEAEs related to  abuse potential were identified. 
-  Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Related to  Alertness or Cognition 
In the search for narrow and broad SMQ terms, TEAEs related to  alertness and cognition  were reported 
by 2 (4.8%) subjects, of which both were in the SGTCS subset of the POS cohort, in the ≥7 to <12 years, 
and  without-concomitant-EIAEDs  cohorts.  These  TEAEs  included  restlessness  and  somnolence  in  1 
subject each. 
CHMP  comments:  
The  TEAE  restlessness  is  not  stated  in  the  SmPC  of  Fycompa  and  is  not  considered  related  to  the 
treatment by the investigator. 
-  Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Related to  Hostility/Aggression 
1 TEAE related to hostility/aggression of irritability was reported by 1 (2.4%) subject in the POS cohort, 
in the ≥7 to <12  years, and with-concomitant-EIAEDs  cohorts. 
CHMP  comments:  
The  TEAE  irritability  is  already stated  in  the  SmPC  of  Fycompa  and  more frequently  observed in  the 
paediatric population. 
-  Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Related to  Psychosis/Psychotic Disorders 
No TEAEs related to  Psychosis/Psychotic Disorders were reported by subjects in  Extension B. 
-  Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Related to  Status Epilepticus/Convulsions 
One  TEAE  of  seizure cluster was  reported by  1  (2.4%)  subject  (POS,  ≥7  to  <12  years,  and  without-
concomitant-EIAEDs cohorts. 
CHMP  comments:  
The  TEAE  seizure  cluster  is  not  stated  in  the  SmPC  of  Fycompa  and  is  not  considered  related to  the 
treatment by the investigator. 
-  Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events Related to  Laboratory Abnormalities 
Overall,  TEAEs  of  drug-related  hepatic  disorders  were  reported  in  4  (9.5%)  subjects  with  4  (9.8%) 
subjects in  the  POS  cohort, including  1  (4.5%)  subject  in  the  SGTCS subset  of  the  POS cohort,  and 2 
subjects in  each of  the  age cohorts.  The events reported included  gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) 
increased (2 [4.8%] subjects), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased, ammonia increased, aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) increased, drug-induced liver injury, and  yellow skin (1  [2.4%]  subject  each). 
All subjects were from the without-concomitant-EIAEDs  cohort, except for the subject with drug-induced 
liver injury (≥7 to <12 years cohort). These changes did not meet Hy’s Law criteria.

CHMP  comments:  
The  TEAE related  to  hepatic  laboratory abnormalities  is  already stated  in  the  SmPC  of  Fycompa as a 
special  warning  and  precaution  for use.  The  increased gamma-glutamyl  transferase (GGT),  the  drug-
induced liver injury and the yellow skin are considered related to the treatment by the investigator. The 
drug-induced  liver  injury  occurred  in  the  concomitant-EIAEDs  cohort  which  could  partly  mitigate  its 
relation. 
-  Cardiac and ECG TEAEs 
No cardiac or ECG TEAEs were reported by subjects in Extension B. 
-  Pregnancy 
No positive pregnancy results were reported for subjects in  Extension B. 
-  TEAEs Related to Rash 
Overall, TEAEs related to rash were reported by 14 (33.3%) subjects, of which 14 (34.1%) subjects were 
in  the  POS  cohort,  including  6  (27.3%)  subjects  in  the  SGTCS subset  of  the  POS  cohort.  The  TEAEs 
related to rash were reported for 5 (45%) subjects in the 4 to <7 years cohort and for 9 (29.0%) subjects 
in the ≥7 to <12  years cohort. Thirteen (34.2%)  subjects in the without-concomitant-EIAEDs  cohort and 
1 (25.0%)  subject in the with-concomitant-EIAEDs  cohort had TEAEs related to  rash. 
The TEAEs related to rash that occurred in more than 1 subject included events of dermatitis (3 [7.1%] 
subjects), and eczema, rash, and varicella (2 [4.8%]  subjects each). 
CHMP  comments: 
According  to  the  SmPC,  severe  cutaneous  adverse  reactions  (SCARs)  including  drug  reaction  with 
eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS)and Stevens - Johnson Syndrome (SJS), which can be life-
threatening  or  fatal,  have  been  reported  with  Fycompa.  No  such  severe  cutaneous  AE  have  been 
observed.  Fourteen  rashes  were  observed  and  none  was  considered  related  to  treatment  by  the 
investigator.  The  only  cutaneous  TEAE  considered related  to  treatment  by  the  investigator  were  nail 
dystrophia and yellow skin (see laboratory abnormalities above). 
-  TEAEs Related to Suicidality 
Subject 29061004  (male, 6 years, japanese) in the SGTCS subset of the POS cohort, taking a 4 mg dose 
of  perampanel,  reported  a  non-serious,  TEAE  of  intentional  self-injury,  which  were  assessed by  the 
investigator as mild in severity and not related to the study drug. The event occurred on Day 494, lasted 
145 days, no action was taken with  the study drug, and the event was considered resolved on Day 638. 
CHMP  comments:  
The TEAE  suicidality is not  considered related to  treatment by the  investigator and  is already stated  in 
the SmPC of Fycompa. 
•  Other  safety findings 
-  Laboratory results 
There were  no  clinically  important  changes in  mean hematology,  chemistry, or  urinalysis  values from 
baseline to end of data cut-off for subjects in  Extension B.  
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/795008/2022  
Page 18/21 
 
 
 
There were  some  markedly abnormal  laboratory values:  markedly abnormal  hematology  values were 
observed in  4  subjects  in  the  POS cohort  (3  [8.1%]  subjects  with  markedly abnormal  low  neutrophil 
counts and 1 [2.7%]  subject with markedly abnormal low hemoglobin).  
One subject in  the POS cohort had a markedly abnormal clinical chemistry results of high GGT.  
There were no markedly abnormal urinalysis values.  
CHMP  comments:  
No  clinical  concerns  were  identified  based  on  analysis  of  markedly  abnormal  laboratory  results.  The 
abnormal  clinical  laboratory  values  were  sporadic  and  there  were  no  consistent  trend  suggestive  of 
clinical concern. 
-  Vital signs 
No  changes of clinical importance in  mean vital signs values over time  and no  shifts of  clinical concern 
in vital signs values were observed. There was a mean (SD) increase in body weight of 6.20 (3.675)  kg 
from baseline to  end of treatment.  This magnitude of change is  expected for growing children up to  12 
years of age and thus  of no clinical concern. No meaningful difference in vital sign results across age or 
concomitant EIAEDs cohorts were observed. 
Clinically  notable low  vital  sign  results  were reported and  included  systolic blood  pressure (5  [12.8%] 
subjects)  (criteria:  <90  mmHg  and  decrease  of  ≥20  mmHg);  diastolic  blood  pressure  (4  [10.3%] 
subjects) (criteria: <50 mmHg and decrease of ≥15 mmHg); and pulse rate (1 [2.6%] subject) (criteria: 
<50 bpm and decrease of ≥15  bpm). 
Clinically  notable  high  vital  sign  results  were  reported  and  included  pulse  rate  (1  [2.6%]  subject) 
(criteria: >120  bpm  and increase of ≥15  bpm)  and weight  (37  [94.9%]  subjects) (criteria: increase of 
>7%). 
CHMP  comments:  
No  clinical  concerns were  identified based on  analysis of these  clinically notable  results.  The abnormal 
low  or  high  vital  signs  values  were sporadic and  there  were  no  consistent  trend  suggestive  of clinical 
concern. 
-  Electrocardiograms 
Not  recorded. 
Rapporteur’s overall Conclusion on safety data of Extension B 
The  results  from  the  data  collected  in  Extension  B  in  children  aged  4  to  <12  years of  age  receiving 
adjunctive perampanel therapy showed that: 
-  The incidence of TEAEs  was similar across the cohorts  of disease, age, and concomitant  EIAEDs  use. 
Most frequently reported TEAEs that occurred in more than 10% of subjects overall were nasopharyngitis, 
influenza, pneumonia, and vomiting. 
- The majority of SAEs and other significant  events of interest were transient and manageable meaning 
that  subjects recovered without  sequelae. 
- There were no trends of clinical concern identified  based on analysis of markedly abnormal laboratory 
results and  shifts  of laboratory parameters over time as  well as  no trends  of clinical  concern based on 
analysis  of  vital  signs,  including  body  weight  (normal  weight  gain  for  growing  paediatrics,  only  one 
subject with  a weight  gain of >  7%).

-  Long-term  daily doses of perampanel oral suspension (overall median duration  of  exposure of  116.7 
weeks i.e. > 2 years) were generally well-tolerated when administered as adjunctive therapy in children 
aged 4  to <12 years of age. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The  Sponsor  has  submitted  final  study  results  and  report  related  to  paediatric  population  for  Study 
E2007-G000-311  (referred to as Study 311). Study 311  was a Phase 3,  multicentre, open-label, single-
arm study in children (aged 4 to <12 years) with inadequately controlled partial-onset seizures (POS) or 
primary  generalized  tonic-clonic  seizures  (PGTCS).  The  study  enrolled  180  subjects  (planned  160 
subjects) and all  subjects were treated with  perampanel in the  study. Of note,  146  subjects completed 
the Core Study, of which 136  subjects entered Extension A. Fifty-three  subjects completed Extension A 
in Japan or France (those eligible to enrol in Extension B), of which  43 subjects entered Extension B. 
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  perampanel  oral 
suspension as an adjunctive therapy in children (aged 4 to <12 years) with inadequately controlled POS 
or PGTCS. 
The Core and Extension  A data were already submitted  and  assessed in a  Type II variation, procedure 
EMEA\H\C\002434\II\0047,  to extend the approved indication for Fycompa to paediatric POS patients 4 
to  less than  12  years and  PGTC of IGE patients  7  to  less  than  12  years that  was approved on 10  Nov 
2020.  The Extension B data were now available and assessed in this submission. 
Regarding efficacy data, no data on the maintenance of efficacy were submitted and assessed within the 
scope of this report.  
Regarding  safety  data,  the  results  of  Extension  B  of  Study  311  show  that  Fycompa  is  overall  well-
tolerated as adjunctive treatment of epilepsy.  
There were 35  (83.3%)  subjects experienced TEAEs during  this  study (10  (90.9%)  subjects in the  4 to 
<7 years cohort and 25 (80.6%)  subjects in the ≥7 to <12 years cohort). The majority of TEAEs reported 
were deemed not related to perampanel. Treatment-related TEAEs were reported for 6 (14.3%)  subjects 
overall. Of the 6 subjects, 1 (9.1%)  subject was in the 4 to <7 years age cohort and 5 (16.1%)  subjects 
were in ≥7  to <12 years age cohort. The treatment-related TEAEs included 1 yellow skin in a subject of 
the 4  to <7 years age cohort and 1 dysphagia, 1 DILI, 1 GGT increased, 1 headache and 1 somnolence 
in one subject each of the ≥7 to <12  years age cohort. 
The  majority of subjects  experienced TEAEs  that  were either  mild  (14  [33.3%]  subjects)  or moderate 
(15  [35.7%]  subjects)  in  severity. Overall, 6  (14.3%)  subjects  had  severe TEAEs.  Most  severe TEAE 
were  related  to  infections  and  infestations  or  respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastina  disorders  MedDRA 
SOC. 
There were 8 (19.0%) subjects who reported SAEs during Extension B of the study. None of the 8 SAEs 
(enterocolitis, bronchitis, lower respiratory tract infection, pharyngitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis acute, 
pneumonia aspiration, upper respiratory tract inflammation, subgaleal haematoma) was assessed by the 
investigator as related to study drug. All occurred in the POS cohort and none in the PGTCS cohort. 
No TEAEs leading to death, life-threatening situations,  persistent or significant disability or incapacity or 
important medical events were reported during Extension B of the study. 
No  subject  in  Extension  B  discontinued  the  study  drug  due  to  a  TEAE. Overall, TEAEs  leading  to  dose 
reduction  were  reported  by  2  (4.8%)  subjects  (both  in  the  SGTCS  subset  of  the  POS  cohort).  Both 
subjects were in the ≥7 to <12  years and without-concomitant-EIAEDs  cohorts. There were no subjects 
with  TEAEs that  led to dose interruption,  dose increase or withdrawal

The AEs described in Extension B of Study 311  are consistent with the known safety profile for Fycompa 
described in the  SmPC and do overall not differ between both  age cohorts (4 to  <7 years cohort and ≥7 
to  <12  years  cohort).  A  review  of  these  AEs  does  not  suggest  novel  or  unexpected  safety  signals 
emerging during the  Extension B  of the  study. There were no significant  changes in the  frequency and 
severity of previously identified adverse reactions or important/potential  risks. 
On the  basis of a review of  the TEAEs in  Extension B of Study 311,  no  additional changes to the  SmPC 
safety information are considered necessary at this time. The data submitted do not influence the benefit-
risk balance for Fycompa. Fycompa continues to  show a favorable benefit-risk profile for the treatment 
of indicated seizure types. 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
Extension B of Study 311 did  not change the benefit risk profile of perampanel as adjunctive treatment 
of focal seizures with or without  SGS in patients from 4 years of age and older and of primary generalised 
tonic-clonic seizures in patients  from 7 years of age and older with  idiopathic generalised epilepsy.  
The submission of this  paediatric study  pursuant to  article 46 of Regulation (EC)  No 1901/2006  did not 
provide new relevant clinical information on the safety in  the targeted paediatric population. 
No  additional  changes  to  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics  (SmPC)  are  requested  which  is 
endorsed.  The  submitted  data  do  not  put  into  question  the  well-known  benefit  to  risk  balance  for 
perampanel for the  adjunctive treatment of: 
- 
partial-onset seizures (POS) with  or without  secondarily generalised seizures in patients from 4 
years of age and older. 
- 
primary generalised tonic-clonic (PGTC) seizures in patients from 7 years of age and older with 
idiopathic generalised epilepsy (IGE).

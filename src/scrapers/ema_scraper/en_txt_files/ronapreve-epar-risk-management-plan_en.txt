Brief description of the product
Chemical class:
Recombinant monoclonal antibodies (IgG1 
isotype)
Summary of mode of action:
Casirivimab and imdevimab are a combination 
therapy of two recombinant human IgG1 
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which are 
unmodified in the Fc regions, where each 
antibody targets the spike protein of severe 
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2).  Casirivimab and imdevimab 
exhibits neutralization activity with a 
concentration of 31.0pM (0.005 μg/mL) 
providing inhibition of 50% of viral infection in a 
plaque-reduction assay (PRNT50). 
Casirivimab and imdevimab binds to non-
overlapping epitopes of the spike protein 
receptor-binding domain (RBD).  The blockage 
of the spike protein interaction with 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) leads 
to inhibition of infection of host cells.
Important information about its composition:
Casirivimab and imdevimab are recombinant 
proteins produced in Chinese Hamster Ovary 
(CHO) cells and purified with a series of 
chromatographic and filtration steps

PART II: SAFETY SPECIFICATION
PART II: MODULE SI EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE INDICATION(S) AND 
TARGET POPULATION(S)
SI.1 PREVENTION AND TREATMENT OF SARS-COV-2 INFECTION
Incidence and Prevalence
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the most recently 
discovered novel coronavirus named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) (WHO COVID-19 Pandemic).  As of 13 December 2021, over 267 million
confirmed cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally by the World Health 
Organization (WHO) with the cumulative prevalence of 3626 cases per 100,000 
population.  In the WHO European region, over 90 million cases were confirmed so far 
with a prevalence of 9932 cases per 100,000 population.  France and United Kingdom 
are the most affected nations in Europe with over 7.5 million and 10 million confirmed 
cases respectively (WHO COVID-19 Pandemic).  
Although, most patients have mild symptoms and good prognosis, COVID-19 can 
develop to severe illnesses including pneumonia, pulmonary edema, acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure, or even death in some cases (Li K et 
al. 2020).  A systematic review estimated that 33% of people with SARS-CoV-2 infection 
(diagnosed through Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests) 
never develop symptoms.  This estimate was based on four large population-based, 
cross-sectional surveys, among which the median proportion of individuals who had no 
symptoms at the time of a positive test was 46% (range: 43% to 77%), and on 14 
longitudinal studies, among which a median of 73% of initially asymptomatic individuals 
remained so on follow-up (Oran and Topol 2021).
Hospitalized patients:  Patients with severe COVID-19 may become critically ill and 
require hospitalization. The prevalence of COVID-19 from European Centre for Disease 
Prevention and Control (ECDC) available from EU/EEA for Week 48 (9 December 2021) 
depicted that the weekly hospitalization rates were 12.2 patients per 100,000 population. 
The rate of ICU admission due to COVID-19 was 1.9 per 100,000 population.  It was 
estimated that the weekly hospitalization peaked at around 15 November 2020 
accounting for the rate of 21.3 per 100,000 population.  The ICU admission rates peaked 
around April 2021 with the rate of 4.0 per 100,000 population (ECDC COVID-19 
Surveillance Report). In the USA, the COVID-19-Associated Hospitalization 
Surveillance Network (COVID-NET) estimates that the cumulative hospitalization rate 
due to COVID-19 on 4 December 2021 was 763.7 per 100,000 population, while the 
weekly hospitalization rate was 3.5 per 100,000 population.  Weekly hospitalization rates 
peaked in January with a rate of 20.7 per 100,000 population, observed on 9 January  
2021 (COVID-NET).

Demographics
Age: According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), SARS-CoV-2 –
the cause of COVID-19, infects people of all ages.  Per ECDC surveillance data for 9
December 2021, the overall 14-day case notification rate in the EU/EEA was 797 per 
100,000 population and in people aged 65 years and older for the EU/EEA, was 423.9
per 100,000 population.  As of week 48 (9 December 2021), the overall epidemiological 
situation in the EU/EEA is characterized by a high and rapidly increasing overall case 
notification rate and a slowly increasing death rate.  Increasing case notification rates 
and an epidemiological situation of high or very high concern are now been observed, 
particularly in western and northern parts of the EU/EEA (ECDC COVID-19 Surveillance 
Report). Data from the CDC COVID Data Tracker on 12 December 2021 reported that 
in the USA, the highest number of cases was in the age group of 18-29 years, 
accounting for 21.5% of the total cases followed by 50-64 years (19.1%), and 30-39 
years (16.6%).  However, evidence suggests that older people and those with underlying 
medical conditions (such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory 
disease, and immunocompromised) are at a higher risk of severe COVID-19 disease 
(COVID-19 CDC).
Gender:  The WHO reported that globally 51% of COVID-19 patients were females and 
49% were males.  In the WHO Europe region, 53% of COVID-19 patients were females 
and 47% were males (WHO COVID-19 cases and deaths with age and sex).  According 
to the CDC COVID Data Tracker, in the USA, a higher proportion of females (52.3%) 
compared to males (47.7%) were reported to be infected with SARS-CoV-2. 
Race/Ethnicity:  A systematic review of 59 cohort studies, including one case-controlled 
study included 17,950,989 COVID-19 cases, among which 64% were Whites, 2.1% were 
Blacks, 5.9% were Asians, 0.086% were Hispanics, and 26% had missing ethnicity data 
(Raharja et al. 2020).  Evidence from the CDC COVID Tracker revealed that in the USA, 
among all COVID-19 positive cases, 55.4% were Whites, followed by Hispanics (24.7%), 
Blacks (11.6%) and Asians (3.1%).
Hospitalized patients: According to the data obtained from ECDC weekly surveillance 
report (week 37, dated 18 September 2021), the hospitalization rates among the COVID-
19 cases for different age groups are presented in the table below.

The hospitalization rate ranged between 0.8% and 44.3% among males, while among 
females, the rates ranged between 0.9% and 30.9% for the same age groups.  However, 
it should be noted that the rates of hospitalization due to COVID-19 increases with the 
age for both sexes.  In addition, the hospitalization rate doubles between the 50-59 age 
group and 60-69 age group and then again between the 60-69 and 70-79 age groups. 
The same trend has been observed in both males and females (ECDC COVID-19 
Surveillance Report).
Among hospitalizations associated with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 reported 
through COVID-NET in the USA, the cumulative rate of hospitalization on 4 December 
2021 was reported to be 70.5 per 100,000 (for those  18 years of age) and, 957.5 per 
100,000 (for those  18 years of age).  The rate of hospitalization was 1127.7 per 
100,000 (for patients aged 50−64 years) and 2112 per 100,000 population for patients 
aged 65 years and older.  Males were reported to have slightly higher rate of 
hospitalization compared to females (782.9 vs 745.2 per 100,000 overall population) 
(COVID-NET). 
The Main Existing Prevention and Treatment Options
Vaccination is the first line of defense in the management and control of COVID-19. 
However, therapeutic agents are also required to support the prevention and treatment 
of COVID-19.  This section provides details on the prevention and potential treatments 
for COVID-19 that the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the 
European Medicines Agency (EMA) have approved/ authorized under emergency use 
provisions, conditional or full Marketing Authorizations, or have provided a scientific 
opinion under Article 5(3) of the EU Regulation (EC) No 726/2004.

According to the CDC treatment guidelines for COVID-19 (updated on 19 October 2021) 
for the USA, patients with COVID-19 infection can experience a range of clinical 
manifestations, from no symptoms to critical illness.  Patients who have mild illness 
usually recover at home, with supportive care and isolation.  Patients who have 
moderate disease should be monitored closely and those with severe disease or critical 
illness should be hospitalized (CDC Treatment Guidelines). 
Prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection:
As of 13 December 2021, the EMA has granted conditional marketing authorization to 
four vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19 (EMA Treatments and Vaccines 2021).  
The vaccines approved by EMA are:
 Comirnaty vaccine, developed by BioNTech and Pfizer, recommended in people 
from 5 years of age.  In May 2021 the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products 
for Human Use (CHMP) recommended granting an extension of indication for 
Comirnaty to include use in children aged 12 to 15 and in November 2021, this 
was extended to children aged 5-11.  The vaccine was already previously
approved for use in adults and adolescents aged 16 and over.  Comirnaty
contains a molecule called messenger RNA (mRNA) with instructions for 
producing a protein from SARS-CoV-2 and does not contain the virus itself.
 Ad26.COV2-S [recombinant] developed by Janssen is made up of another virus 
(of the adenovirus family) that has been modified to contain the gene for making 
the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.  The adenovirus passes the SARS-CoV-2 gene 
into the vaccinated person’s cells.  It is recommended for people aged 18 years 
and older.
 Spikevax, another mRNA vaccine (nucleoside modified) developed by Moderna 
is the third vaccine authorized by the EMA for people aged 12 years and older.
 Vaxzevria (previously named COVID-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca), that is also made 
up of another virus (of the adenovirus family) which has been modified to contain 
the gene for making a protein from SARS-CoV-2, has also received conditional 
approval. The adenovirus passes the SARS-CoV-2 gene into the vaccinated 
person’s cells.  This vaccine is recommended in people aged 18 years and older.
Vaccines which are still under evaluation, are COVID-19 Vaccine (Vero Cell) Inactivated 
(developed by Sinovac Life Sciences), Nuvaxovid (developed by Novavax CZ AS), 
Sputnik V (developed by Russia’s Gamaleya National Centre of Epidemiology and 
Microbiology),Vidprevtyn (Sanofi Pasteur) and VLA2001 (Valneva) (EMA Treatments 
and Vaccines 2021).  
In the USA, currently, two mRNA vaccines are available. The two-dose series of the 
BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine was approved by the FDA for individuals aged 
16 years, but it can be administered to individuals aged 5 years and older under an 
Emergency Use Authorization (EUA).  The two-dose series of the mRNA-1273 
(Moderna) vaccine has an EUA for individuals aged 18 years.  The FDA also issued an 
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 2.0 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd
casirivimab and imdevimab
17
of
147
EUA for a single dose human adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) vectored vaccine, 
Ad26.COV2.S (Johnson & Johnson/Janssen), for those aged 18 years (CDC Treatment 
Guidelines).  As of the 19 October 2021 guidelines, the CDC recommends giving an 
additional dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine to people who are at high risk of having 
suboptimal immune responses to a two-dose series. Because the effectiveness of the 
BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine may wane over time, CDC recommends 
administering a booster dose of the vaccine to these individuals at least 6 months after 
they complete the primary series. EMA’s human medicines committee (CHMP) has also 
concluded that an extra dose of the COVID-19 vaccines Comirnaty (BioNTech/Pfizer) 
and Spikevax (Moderna) may be given to people with severely weakened immune 
systems, at least 28 days after their second dose.
Treatment of COVID-19 disease:
Non-hospitalized patients:  The EMA’s CHMP has granted marketing authorization to 
the monoclonal antibodies’ (mAbs) combination (casirivimab/imdevimab) and Regkirona 
(regdanvimab) for treating COVID-19 in adults and adolescents (from 12 years of age 
and weighing at least 40 kilograms) who do not require supplemental oxygen and who 
are at increased risk of their disease becoming severe (EMA Treatments and Vaccines 
2021). Casirivimab/imdevimab combination had been granted EUA from FDA and on 3 
June 2021, the FDA re-issued the letter of authorization for casirivimab and imdevimab 
treatment for COVID-19 to authorize a dosage change from 1200 mg of casirivimab and 
1200 mg of imdevimab to 600 mg of casirivimab and 600 mg of imdevimab.  In addition, 
the FDA authorized SC injection as an alternative route of administration when IV
infusion is not feasible and would lead to delay in treatment (CDC Treatment 
Guidelines).  Bamlanivimab plus etesevimab, a mABs combination, had also been 
granted EUA by FDA to treat non-hospitalized patients with mild to moderate COVID-19, 
however EMA has ended the rolling review of bamlanivimab and etesevimab (CDC 
Treatment Guidelines, EMA Treatments and Vaccines 2021).  EMA has started 
evaluating an application for marketing authorization for the monoclonal antibody 
Xevudy (sotrovimab) for the treatment of adults and adolescents with COVID-19 who do 
not require supplemental oxygen therapy. FDA also recommended sotrovimab under 
EUA for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adult and pediatric patients who 
are at high risk for progression to severe COVID-19, including hospitalization or death
(CDC Treatment Guidelines, EMA Treatments and Vaccines 2021).  EMA has started 
evaluating an application for marketing authorization for the oral antiviral medicine 
Lagevrio (molnupiravir) that is intended for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults. EMA 
has started rolling review of Evusheld (also known as AZD7442), a combination of two 
monoclonal antibodies (tixagevimab and cilgavimab) for the prevention of COVID-19 in 
adults (EMA Treatments and Vaccines 2021). The FDA issued the EUA for Evusheld 
(tixagevimab with cilgavimab) for the pre-exposure prophylaxis (prevention) of COVID-
19 in certain adults and pediatric individuals (FDA News Release). EMA is reviewing 
currently available data on the use of Paxlovid (PF-07321332/ritonavir), an oral

treatment for COVID-19 in non-hospitalized patients with mild to moderate disease 
(EMA Treatments and Vaccines 2021). 
Hospitalized patients:  As therapeutic treatment, the EMA and the FDA granted a 
conditional marketing authorization and full authorization, respectively, to remdesivir for 
the treatment of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with 
pneumonia who require supplemental oxygen (CDC Treatment Guidelines, EMA 
Treatments and Vaccines 2021).  The EMA has also granted the marketing authorization 
to RoActemra (tocilizumab) for the treatment of adults with COVID-19 who are receiving 
systemic treatment with corticosteroids and require supplemental oxygen or mechanical 
ventilation.  Tocilizumab had also been granted EUA by FDA for the treatment of 
hospitalized adults and pediatric COVID-19 patients. On 11 February 2021, the National 
Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in the UK recommended tocilizumab as 
a treatment option through routine commissioning for adult patients (aged 18 years and 
older) hospitalized with COVID-19 (NICE 2021). 
The EMA has started evaluation of marketing authorizations for three drugs which 
include Kineret (anakinra) for treatment of COVID in adult patients with pneumonia who 
are at increased risk of severe respiratory failure, and Olumiant (baricitinib) for 
hospitalized COVID-19 patients requiring supplemental oxygen (EMA Treatments and 
Vaccines 2021). 
In the recent update of CDC treatment guidelines for COVID-19, the panel 
recommended using either baricitinib or tocilizumab in combination with dexamethasone 
alone or dexamethasone plus remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized 
In the rare circumstance when 
patients on high-flow oxygen or noninvasive ventilation.
corticosteroids cannot be used, the panel recommended using baricitinib in combination 
with remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19 in hospitalized, non-intubated patients 
who require oxygen supplementation.  The combination had already been granted EUA 
from FDA (CDC Treatment Guidelines).  Additionally, the CDC recommends that in
hospitalized patients that require invasive mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal 
membrane oxygenation, combination of dexamethasone plus IV tocilizumab should be 
used.  If IV tocilizumab is not available or feasible to use, IV sarilumab can be used 
(CDC Treatment Guidelines) supplemental oxygen therapy (EMA Treatments and 
Vaccines 2021).
Risk Factors for the Disease
Older adults are more likely to get severely ill from COVID-19.  More than 80% of 
COVID-19 deaths occur in people over age 65, and more than 95% of COVID-19 deaths 
occur in people older than 45.  Long-standing systemic health and social inequities have 
put various groups of people at increased risk of getting sick and dying from COVID-19, 
including many racial and ethnic minority groups and people with disabilities.  A meta-
analysis of 50 studies (42 were from the USA and 8 from the United Kingdom) reported

that individuals from Black [Relative Risk (RR): 2.02; 95% CI 1.67-2.44)] and Asian (RR: 
1.50; 95% CI 1.24-1.83) ethnicities had a higher risk of COVID-19 infection compared to 
White individuals.  Asians may be at higher risk of intensive therapy unit admission and 
death (Sze et al. 2020).
Chronic underlying health conditions also place patients at increased risk for developing 
severe disease.  These include cancer; chronic kidney disease; chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease; Down Syndrome; heart conditions, such as heart failure, coronary 
artery disease, or cardiomyopathies; immunocompromised state (weakened immune 
system); liver disease; obesity (body mass index [BMI] of 30 kg/m2 or higher but   40 
kg/m2); severe obesity (BMI  40 kg/m2); pregnancy; sickle cell disease; cerebrovascular 
disease; and Type 2 diabetes mellitus (ECDC High Risk Groups; CDC People at 
Increased Risk).  
Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the (Untreated) Population
As of 13 December 2021, there have been over 5.28 million deaths among 267.8 million 
cases worldwide due to COVID-19, a death rate of 72 per 100,000 population, with case 
fatality rates ranging from 1.4% (WHO western Pacific region) to 2.4% (WHO American 
Region).  In the WHO European region, approximately 1.59 million deaths were reported 
(case fatality rates: 1.8%), a death rate of 174 per 100,000 population (WHO COVID-19 
Pandemic). 
A systematic review of 51 studies consisting of 17,501,820 COVID-19 patients reported 
ethnicity-aggregated mortality data.  Among patients who died from COVID-19, 63% 
were Whites, 6.0% Asians, 2.1% were Blacks, 0.069% Hispanics, 2.9% others, and 26% 
had missing ethnicity data.  Compared to White ethnicity, age- and sex-adjusted all-
cause mortality risks were significantly elevated for Black (HR: 1.38 [1.09–1.75]) and 
Asian (HR: 1.42 [1.15–1.75]), but not for Hispanic (RR: 1.14 [0.93–1.40]) (Raharja et al. 
2020).
Hospitalized patients:  According to the ECDC Country Overview report dated 9
December 2021, the 14-day COVID-19 death rate for the EU/EEA was reported to be 
55.9 per 100,000 population and had been stable for two weeks (ECDC COVID-19 
Surveillance Report). 
A prospective observational study in East London, United Kingdom, included 1737 
patients aged 16 years and above admitted to hospital between 1 January and 13 May 
2020. 30-day mortality among hospitalized patients was found to be 29.2%, of whom 
31% were Asian, 20% were Blacks and 40% Whites (Apea et al. 2021).
According to the CDC COVID Data Tracker, in the USA, out of 674,231 deaths, data on 
Race/Ethnicity were available for 574,605 (85%) deaths, of which Non-Hispanic Whites 
(61.6%) were reported to be highest in mortality, followed by Hispanics (17.5%) and 
Non-Hispanic Blacks (13.7%).

A meta-analysis including data from 80 studies (n  25,385), reported a pooled in-
hospital mortality of 14% (95% CI: 12.2, 15.9) due to COVID-19.  The pooled in-hospital 
mortality of COVID-19 patients was 10.1%, 23.7%, and 25.4% in Asia, Europe, and 
North America, respectively.  Greater age (mean difference: 13.32), being male (odds 
ratio [OR]  1.66), hypertension (OR  2.67), and having diabetes (OR 2.14), chronic 
respiratory disease (OR  3.55), chronic heart disease/cardiovascular disease (OR 
3.15), elevated levels of high-sensitive cardiac troponin I (mean difference  66.65), D-
dimer (mean difference = 4.33), or C-reactive protein (mean difference  48.03), and a 
decreased level of albumin at admission (mean difference   −3.98) were associated 
with higher risk of death in patients with COVID-19 (Wu et al. 2021).  However, since the 
meta-analysis collected information only until 26 May 2020, the mortality rates and risk 
factors for mortality depicted here could differ compared to the current scenario.
Important Comorbidities
analysis included all COVID-19 studies published 
A systematic review and meta
between 1 January 2020 and 24 July 2020 in which there were reported comorbidities.  
Of the 120 studies with 125,446 COVID-19 patients, the most prevalent comorbidities 
were hypertension (32%), obesity (25%), diabetes (18%), cardiovascular disease (16%), 
lung disease (9%), chronic kidney or other renal diseases (6%), cancer (5%), liver 
disease (5%) and cerebrovascular accident (4%) (Thakur et al. 2021).
-
Hospitalized patients:  According to the ECDC, prevalence of preexisting medical 
conditions in hospitalized COVID-19 patients were cardiac disorders (23.6%), diabetes 
(16.8%), cancer (9%), chronic lung disease (3.6%), hypertension (2.6%), neurological 
disorders (1.8%), and asthma (1.3%) (ECDC COVID-19 Surveillance Report). 
In the USA, as of 30 September 2021, preliminary data from the CDC (COVID-NET) 
estimated that among hospitalized adults with information on underlying medical 
conditions, the most commonly reported were hypertension (56.8%), obesity (50.5%), 
metabolic disease (41.7%), and cardiovascular disease (36.7%).  Other underlying 
conditions included chronic lung disease (20.3%), neurologic diseases (18.9%) and 
renal disease (16%) (COVID-NET).
PART II: MODULE SII NONCLINICAL PART OF THE SAFETY 
SPECIFICATION
Key safety findings from nonclinical studies and relevance to human usage. 
TOXICITY
The in-vivo safety and toxicokinetic profiles of casirivimab and imdevimab alone and in 
combination were evaluated in a GLP-compliant 4-week repeat dose toxicology study in 
cynomolgus monkeys with an 8-week recovery period (R10933-TX-20064).  Both mAbs 
are directed against an exogenous target; therefore, a short-term study in one species is 
considered appropriate to support clinical development and is consistent with the 
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 2.0 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd
casirivimab and imdevimab
21
of
147
guidance “Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived Pharmaceuticals” (ICH 
S6 [R1], 2011).  The cynomolgus monkey was chosen as the test species to allow for a 
robust evaluation of cardiovascular and respiratory safety pharmacology endpoints and 
to facilitate pharmacokinetic assessment for estimating drug exposures in humans
Repeat dose toxicity
In Study R10933-TX-20064, once weekly IV injection of 50 mg/kg casirivimab alone or 
imdevimab alone or IV or SC injection of up to 150 mg/kg/antibody in combination for 4 
weeks was well tolerated in the cynomolgus monkey.  There was no mortality or adverse 
clinical signs evident throughout the study and there were no drug-related changes in 
any of the parameters evaluated. 
In all groups, including control, there were transient, minimal to mild increases in C-
reactive protein (CRP) on Day 2 and minimal increases in fibrinogen, with or without a 
minimal decrease in albumin, on Days 2 and/or 7, which returned to within normal range 
by Day 27.  Additionally, there were transient minimal to mild increases in aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and/or LDH in individual 
animals on Days 2 and 7 that returned within the range of control and/or baseline values 
by Day 27.  These observed changes were considered to be transient in nature 
corroborated by lack of cytokine correlates (CRP), low incidence, minimal to mild 
magnitude of change, lack of dose response, and/or presence of similar changes in 
controls.  As such, the observed changes are considered to be of uncertain relationship 
to casirivimab or imdevimab, are possibly related to study procedures, and are not 
considered to be adverse.  On Day 27, clinical pathology changes were limited to a 
minimal increase in serum globulins at 150 mg/kg/antibody IV and SC.  These changes 
are considered to be artifacts related to high doses of immunoglobulin administered 
during the study and are considered to be of no toxicological significance.  There were 
no macroscopic or microscopic findings or organ-weight changes related to the 
administration of casirivimab and/or imdevimab at the end of the dosing or recovery 
period.
Based on the above, the no-observed-adverse-effect level is considered to be 50 mg/kg 
casirivimab and 50 mg/kg imdevimab when administered alone and 150 mg/kg/antibody 
for casirivimab and imdevimab, the highest doses evaluated.
Relevance to human usage: Findings from repeat –dose toxicity study has not 
revealed a risk for humans.
Reproductive/developmental toxicity
Reproductive and developmental toxicology studies with casirivimab and imdevimab 
were not performed.  Given that both mAbs are directed against an exogenous target 
and consistent with the guidance “Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-Derived 
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 2.0 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd
casirivimab and imdevimab
22
of
147
Pharmaceuticals” (ICH S6 [R1], 2011), reproductive and developmental toxicology 
studies were considered not appropriate.
Furthermore, during the GLP 4-week toxicology study conducted in cynomolgus 
monkeys (Study R10933TX20064); there were no drug-related macroscopic or 
microscopic changes in the testes, epididymides, ovaries, uterus, or vagina.  The 4-week 
toxicology study did not identify any potential risks to fertility.
Relevance to human usage
As casirivimab and imdevimab, are directed towards an exogenous target, and no 
human fetal tissue binding was detected in tissue cross-reactivity studies, effects on 
fetus and reproductive organs in males and females are not anticipated.
GENERAL SAFETY PHARMACOLOGY 
Safety pharmacology evaluations were integrated into the ongoing GLP 4-week repeat
dose toxicology study conducted in cynomolgus monkeys (Study R10933TX-20064). 
There were no drug-related cardiovascular (electrocardiographic [ECG] measurements 
via Jacketed External Telemetry™), respiratory (pulse oximetry) or CNS (neurological 
examination) changes evident following the 4 once weekly doses of casirivimab or 
imdevimab alone (50 mg/kg) or in combination (up to 150 mg/kg/antibody).
Relevance to human usage: Findings from general safety pharmacology study 
(integrated into Study R10933TX-20064) have not revealed a risk for humans.
LOCAL TOLERABILITY
Local tolerability of the IV administration of casirivimab and imdevimab alone or the IV or 
SC administration of casirivimab and imdevimab was evaluated in the GLP 4-week 
repeat dose toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys (Study R10933 TX-20064).  
There were no drug-related clinical observations at the IV or SC administration sites 
during the 4-week dosing period.
Relevance to human usage: Findings from local tolerability study (integrated into Study 
R10933TX-20064) have not revealed a risk for humans.
PART II: MODULE SIII CLINICAL TRIAL EXPOSURE
Clinical trial exposure in the target populations is based on the following six studies: 
R10933-10987-COV-2066, R10933-10987-COV-2067, R10933-10987-COV-2069,

patients with 597.33 patient-years of exposure.  Patients in the IV Safety Analysis Set 
will be followed up for up to 24 weeks.  As of the cutoff dates for Studies COV-2067 (18
February 2021) and COV-20145 (8 February 2021), no patients had been followed up 
for 20 weeks or more.  Overall, the majority of patients (88.7% [4142/4666]) had been 
followed up for at least 4 weeks.  A total of 25 patients (25/4666 [0.53%]) had been 
followed up for at least 16 weeks (Table 4).
The IV Safety Analysis Set for Hospitalized Patients provided data from 5771 patients
with 502.9 patient-years of exposure. Overall, the majority of patients in COV-2066 
(73.3% [1080/1473]) had been followed up for at least 8 weeks while the majority of 
patients in RECOVERY (81.3%; [3495/4298]) had been followed up for at least 4 weeks.  
Data were only available for up to 4 weeks of follow-up for RECOVERY.  A confirmed 
total of 46 patients (46/6312 [0.7%]) in COV-2066 had been followed up for at least 16
weeks (Table 5).

The Single Dose SC Safety Analysis Set provided data from 1694 patients with 459.71
patient-years of exposure.  Patients in the Single Dose SC Analysis Set will be followed 
up for up to 32 weeks.  Overall, the majority of patients (91.5% [1550/1694]) had been 
followed up for at least 4 weeks.  A total of 16 patients (16/1694 [0.9%] had been 
followed up for at least 32 weeks (Table 6).
The Repeat Dose SC Analysis Set (Study HV-2093) provided data from 729 subjects 
with 245.70 person-years of exposure.  In Study HV-2093, subjects will be followed up 
for up to 53 weeks.  As of the cutoff date (13 March 2021), no subject had been followed 
up for up to 53 weeks.  Overall, the majority of subjects (99.5% [725/729]) had been 
followed up for at least 4 weeks.  A total of 41 subjects (41/729 [5.6%]) had been

EXPOSURE BY DOSE RECEIVED
In the IV Safety Analysis Set, exposure was calculated according to a patient’s actual 
treatment received.  
In the studies involving non-hospitalized patients, most patients (47.6% [n  2222]) 
received the 2.4 g (1.2 g of each mAb) IV dose, followed by the 8.0 g (4.0 g of each
mAb) IV dose, (27.2% [n  1272 patients)).  A total of 943 (20.2%) patients received the 
1.2 g (0.6 g of each mAb) IV dose (Table 12). 
For the studies involving Hospitalized Patients, most patients (87.2% [n  5031 patients]) 
received the 8.0g (4.0g of each mAb) IV dose, followed by the 2.4 g (1.2 g of each mAb) 
IV dose (12.8% [n  740 patients]) (Table 13).

Treatment indication (Study COV-2067):
Has participated, is participating, 
or plans to participate in a clinical 
research study evaluating any 
authorized, approved, or 
investigational vaccine for SARS-
CoV-2
CDC guidance recommends deferral of 
SARS-CoV-2 vaccination for at least 90 
days after administration of passive 
antibody therapy to avoid interference of 
the treatment with vaccine induced 
immune responses
No
Section 4.5 of the EU SmPC states that no 
formal drug-drug interaction studies have 
been performed.  Casirivimab and 
imdevimab are monoclonal antibodies, 
which are not renally excreted or 
metabolised by cytochrome P450 enzymes; 
therefore, interactions with concomitant 
medicinal products that are renally excreted 
or that are substrates, inducers, or 
inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes are 
unlikely.
An interaction study (COV-2118) to assess 
the immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability

No
Section 4.2 of the EU SmPC states that the 
administration of RONAPREVE should be 
under conditions where management of 
severe hypersensitivity reactions, such as 
anaphylaxis, is possible. Individuals should 
be monitored after administration according 
to local medical practice.
Section 4.4 of the EU SmPC states that 
hypersensitivity reactions, including 
anaphylaxis, have been reported with 
administration of casirivimab and 
imdevimab. If signs or symptoms of a 
clinically significant hypersensitivity reaction 
or anaphylaxis occur, immediately 
discontinue administration and initiate 
appropriate medications and/or supportive 
care.

Criterion
Reason for Exclusion
Pregnant or breastfeeding women 
were excluded in early versions of 
the protocols for Studies COV-
2066, COV-2067, COV-2069,and 
COV-20145 (without risk factors)
There is currently limited clinical 
experience in the use of casirivimab, 
imdevimab, and casirivimab  imdevimab 
in female subjects who are pregnant or 
breastfeeding.  As casirivimab and 
imdevimab are directed against an 
exogenous antigen (the S protein of 
SARS-CoV-2), administration 
casirivimab  imdevimab is not 
anticipated to affect endogenous 
pathways.  Therefore, the safety profile 
in pregnant women is expected to be 
similar to that observed in adults and 
adolescents.  Casirivimab and 
imdevimab should be used during 
pregnancy or breastfeeding only if the 
potential benefit justifies the potential 
risk for the mother and the fetus or 
breastfed child considering all 
associated health factors
Is it to be 
included as 
missing 
information? 
(Yes/No)
Rationale
Yes (use in 
pregnancy only)
Use in pregnancy - not applicable (included 
as missing information)
Section 4.6 of the EU SmPC states that It is 
unknown whether casirivimab and 
imdevimab are excreted in human milk, but 
maternal IgG is known to be transferred to 
milk during the first days after birth. As 
casirivimab and imdevimab directly target 
the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 and in 
view of low systemic absorption after oral 
ingestion of antibodies, administration of 
RONAPREVE whilst breastfeeding can be 
considered when clinically indicated.

The clinical trial development program for casirivimab and imdevimab was unable to 
detect adverse drug reactions that are:
 Rare adverse reactions: The casirivimab and imdevimab safety population 
provides data from 12860 patients with 5586.93 patient-years of follow-up from 
the Phase I, Phase II, Phase III, and Phase1/2/3 studies HV-2093 (Phase 1), 
COV-20145 (Phase 2), COV-2069 (Phase 3), COV-2066 (Phase 1/2/3), 
RECOVERY and COV-2067 (Phase 1/2/3).
 Caused by prolonged exposure: All patients in the IV Safety Analysis Set
(including hospitalized patients) and the SC Safety Analysis set received only 
one dose of casirivimab and imdevimab with the exception of subjects in Study 
HV-2093 who can receive up to 6 SC doses.  To date, no ADRs caused by 
prolonged exposure have been observed.
 Caused by cumulative exposure: There have been 12131 patients who 
received a single dose IV or SC of casirivimab and imdevimab and 729 patients 
received repeated dosing with cumulative exposure of 337.00 patient-years (see
Table 4, Table 5, Table 6, Table 7, respectively), and no cumulative toxicities 
have been observed to date.
 Have a long latency: Overall, as of the data cutoffs, the vast majority of patients 
had been followed up for safety for at least 4 weeks (88.7%, 91.5%, and 99.5% 
in the IV Safety Analysis Set, the Single Dose SC Safety Analysis Set, and the 
Repeat Dose SC Analysis Set, respectively).  In the non-hospitalized IV Safety 
Analysis Set 0.53% of patients have been followed up for at least 16 weeks.  In 
the IV Safety Analysis Set for hospitalized patients, 81.1% of patients have been 
followed up for at least 4 weeks and 0.7% of patients have been followed up for 
at least 16 weeks.  In the Single Dose SC Safety Analysis Set and in the Repeat 
Dose SC Analysis Set, 0.9% of patients and 5.6% of subjects, respectively, have 
been followed up for at least 32 weeks.  To date, no ADRs with long latency 
periods have been observed, however, the follow-up data available up to data 
cutoffs, are not yet sufficient to ascertain any long latency effects.

PART II: MODULE SV POST-AUTHORIZATION EXPERIENCE
Between 21 November 2020 to 31 October 2021, Roche has supplied Ronapreve 
(casirivimab and imdevimab) combo packs to approximately 1,000,000 patients globally, 
either through EUA equivalent regulatory pathways or Marketing Approval. Accurate 
exposure data are not available as Ronapreve has been provided to governmental

institutions, and its distribution is under the control and responsibility of national 
governments or Health Agencies.
Cumulative patient exposure from marketing experience
As of 30 September 2021, only IV use of Ronapreve for treatment of COVID-19 was
approved in the UK and Japan. 
United Kingdom: 
As of 30 September 2021, 49 patients had been exposed to Ronapreve in the UK 
(Table 26).
Japan
As of 30 September 2021, 30322 patients had been exposed to Ronapreve in Japan 
(Table 26).  Based on published age and gender data, the estimated exposure is as 
follows:



For patients treated with Ronapreve in Tokyo, it is estimated that of the age these 
patients were as follows: 27.0% were  65 years old, 73.0% were <65 years old
There is no meaningful difference in the ratio of newly infected persons between 
Tokyo and Japan at the age of 65
For the period 27 September 2021 to 05 October 2021, it is estimated that the 
gender of the patients was as follows:

PART II: MODULE SVI ADDITIONAL EU REQUIREMENTS FOR THE 
SAFETY SPECIFICATION
POTENTIAL FOR MISUSE FOR ILLEGAL PURPOSES
Drugs that have a potential for misuse for illegal purposes are expected to share general 
characteristics such as psychoactive, stimulant, or sedative effects, or less commonly, 
anabolic effects or enhancement of hemoglobin levels.  Casirivimab and imdevimab are 
directed at an exogenous antigen and do not react with mammalian tissues.  Based on 
nonclinical studies, casirivimab and imdevimab do not penetrate into the CNS; therefore,
it is unlikely that casirivimab and imdevimab will be misused for illegal purposes.

SVII.1.1
Safety Concerns in the RMP
Risks Not Considered Important for Inclusion in the List of 
Reason for NOT including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety 
concerns in the RMP:
Identified Risk Considered Not Important: 
Known risks that require no further characterisation and are followed up via routine 
pharmacovigilance namely through signal detection and adverse reaction reporting, and 
for which the risk minimisation messages in the product information are adhered to by 
prescribers (e.g. actions being part of standard clinical practice in each EU Member 
State where the product is authorised):
 Systemic hypersensitivity reactions (HSRs) (including acute infusion-related 
reactions [IRRs] and/or injection site reactions [ISRs])
Potential Risk Considered Not Important:
Risks with minimal clinical impact on patients (in relation to the severity of the indication 
treated): 

Immunogenic response following administration with possible consequences on 
safety and immunogenicity. 
Other reasons for considering the risks not important:
 Viral variants and potential promotion of resistant virus
 (assessed primarily as an efficacy concern)
 Embryo fetal toxicity (considered within the use in pregnancy missing 
information)

Missing Information of Use in Pregnancy
Risk-benefit impact: 
There is currently limited clinical experience with the use of casirivimab and imdevimab 
in patients and subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding (see Table 25).  In addition, 
animal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted.  As
casirivimab and imdevimab, are directed towards an exogenous target, and no human 
fetal tissue binding was detected in tissue cross-reactivity studies, effects on fetus and 
reproductive organs in males and females are not anticipated.
Casirivimab and imdevimab should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit 
justifies the potential risk for the mother and the fetus/baby considering all associated
health factors.

Presentation of the Missing Information
Evidence source:
Pregnancy
There are limited amount of data from the use of casirivimab and imdevimab in pregnant 
women (see Table 25).  Animal reproductive toxicity studies were not conducted;
however, in a tissue cross-reactivity study with casirivimab and imdevimab using human 
fetal tissues, as anticipated, no binding was detected, as both mAbs bind to exogenous 
protein.  Human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibodies are known to cross the placental

mAbs bind to exogenous protein.  Human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) antibodies are 
known to cross the placental barrier; therefore, casirivimab and imdevimab have the 
potential to be transferred from the mother to the developing fetus.  It is unknown 
whether the potential transfer of casirivimab and imdevimab provides any treatment 
benefit or risk to the developing fetus. 
Population in need of further characterization
The available data are insufficient to characterize the use of casirivimab and imdevimab 
in pregnant women and there is a need to further characterize their use in these 
patients.

Summary of Risk Management Plan for Ronapreve (casirivimab and 
Imdevimab)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for RONAPREVE.  The RMP 
details important risks of RONAPREVE, how these risks can be minimized, and how 
more information will be obtained about RONAPREVE’s risks and uncertainties (missing 
information).
RONAPREVE’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how RONAPREVE 
should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for RONAPREVE should be read in the context of all this 
information, including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all, which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
RONAPREVE’s RMP.
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
I.
RONAPREVE is a combination of casirivimab and imdevimab authorized for:



Treatment of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older 
weighing at least 40 kg who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at 
increased risk of progressing to severe COVID-19.
Treatment of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older 
weighing at least 40 kg and receiving supplemental oxygen, who have a negative 
SARS-CoV-2 antibody test result.
Prevention of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and older 
weighing at least 40 kg.
It contains casirivimab and imdevimab as the active substances, and it is given by 
intravenous (IV) or subcutaneous (SC) route.
Further information about the evaluation of RONAPREVE’s benefits can be found in 
RONAPREVE’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
Web site, under the medicine’s Web page:
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/ronapreve
II. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO 
MINIMIZE OR FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THE RISKS
Important risks of RONAPREVE, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about RONAPREVE’s risks are outlined below.

Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:




Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorized pack sizeThe amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so as to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly;
The medicine’s legal statusThe way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., 
with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected
continuously and regularly analyzed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate
action can be taken as necessary.  These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of casirivimab and imdevimab is not 
yet available, it is listed under “missing Information” below.
II.A
List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of RONAPREVE are risks that need special risk management activities 
to further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered.  Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks 
are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of RONAPREVE.  
Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is 
possible based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and 
needs further evaluation.  Missing information refers to information about the safety of 
the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the 
long-term use of the medicine).

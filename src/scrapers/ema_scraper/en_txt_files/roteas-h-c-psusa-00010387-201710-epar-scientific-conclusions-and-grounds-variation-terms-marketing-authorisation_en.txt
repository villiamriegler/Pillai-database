Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for edoxaban, the scientific 
conclusions of the CHMP are as follows:  
A number of cases of thrombocytopenia have been reported spontaneously and thrombocytopenia was 
uncommonly reported as an adverse event in pivotal clinical trials. Many of the spontaneously reported 
cases involved concomitant use of other medications and the causal role of edoxaban is difficult to 
establish, but equally in some cases the data are suggestive of a possible causal association. The MAH 
has already identified thrombocytopenia as a post-marketing adverse drug reaction (ADR) and the 
product information section 4.8 is being updated accordingly together with consequential changes to the 
Package Leaflet.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for edoxaban the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing edoxaban is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

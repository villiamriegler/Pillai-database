SmPC and PL 
Interaction study A4250-022 with a lipophilic combination 
order to update an existing warning, add drug-drug 
interaction (DDI) information with oral 
contraceptives and update information for women of 
childbearing potential, based on study A4250-022 
listed as a category 3 study in the RMP; this is an 
open-label, phase 1 DDI study to evaluate the 
interaction of odevixibat with oral lipophilic 
contraceptives in healthy volunteers. The Package 
Leaflet and the RMP vs 4.1 is updated accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
oral contraceptive containing ethinyl estradiol (EE) (0.03 
mg) and levonorgestrel (LVN) (0.15 mg) conducted in adult 
healthy females, concomitant use of odevixibat had no 
impact on the AUC of LVN and decreased the AUC of EE by 
17%, which is not considered clinically relevant. Interaction 
studies with other lipophilic medicinal products have not 
been performed, therefore, an effect on the absorption of 
other fat-soluble medicinal products cannot be excluded.

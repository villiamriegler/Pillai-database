2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) 
resulting in neurological impairment and severe disability. The present application seeks approval of 
cladribine for the treatment of adult patients with highly active relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) 
as defined by clinical or imaging features. During the course of the procedure the target population was 
revised to adult patients with highly active relapsing MS (RMS).  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
MS is the most common cause of serious neurological disability in young adults. It is estimated that more 
than 2.3 million people have MS worldwide. While MS is a global disease, its prevalence increases with 
distance from the equator. The prevalence of MS is highest in North America and Europe (140 and 108 per 
100,000 respectively) and lowest in sub-Saharan Africa and East Asia at 2.1 and 2.2 per 100,000, 
respectively.  
MS typically begins between the ages of 20 to 40 years. Overall, women are affected approximately twice as 
often as men, except in individuals with the primary-progressive form of the disease, where there is no 
gender prevalence difference. The vast majority of patients (approximately 85%) first present with the RRMS 
form (Lublin et al., 2014), which usually later evolves into secondary-progressive MS (SPMS). Within ten 
years more than 50% of patients who suffer from a relapsing-remitting form eventually develop SPMS, which 
is characterised by sustained disability with or without superimposed relapses. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
While the exact cause of MS is unknown, an autoimmune process has been implicated involving both a 
genetic predisposition and environmental triggers.  
The neuropathology of the disease is marked by an aberrant activation of specific T and B cells that recognize 
self-antigens (i.e., myelin) expressed in the CNS. MS relapses are considered the clinical expression of acute 
inflammatory focal lesions associated with an influx of inflammatory T cells and B cells into the CNS, leading 
to breakdown of the blood-brain barrier, followed by entry of innate immune cells including B cells 
andmonocytes and macrophages. This leads to oligodendrocyte loss, demyelination, axonal damage, and 
neuronal loss. 
In addition, disease progression irrespective of relapses can occur, which is considered due likely to a 
neurodegenerative process associated with demyelination, impaired remyelination, axonal loss and neuronal 
loss independent of CNS inflammation. 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 8/131 
  
  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis 
Relapsing MS is characterized by multifocal inflammatory lesions that can manifest clinically with neurological 
signs and symptoms with variable recovery (Phadke and Downie, 1987). The term comprises patients with 
RRMS and SPMS with superimposed relapses. In line with the CHMP Guideline on clinical investigations of 
medicinal products for the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (EMA/CHMP/771815/2011, Rev. 2), it can be 
assumed that relapses in RRMS and SPMS have the same underlying inflammatory pathophysiology. 
RRMS is characterized by periodic acute exacerbations of disease activity (relapses) and periods of remission, 
consisting of partial or complete recovery. The frequency of relapses and the incidence of brain lesions vary 
considerably in patients with RRMS; relapses and the presence of new brain lesions on magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) are used to define disease activity. With recurring relapses, disability tends to accumulate, and 
over time it may disrupt patients’ family, social, and working lives, undermining their capacity to function in 
society. As the disease progresses, patients may experience fewer relapses but continue to accumulate 
disability, a stage referred to as SPMS. Patients with SPMS continue to steadily accumulate disability 
irrespective of the presence or absence of superimposed relapses.  
Most countries in the world make use of the McDonald criteria for the diagnosis of MS, which are based on 
both clinical grounds and MRI imaging to demonstrate dissemination of lesions in space and time. A recent 
revision in 2010 resulted in a simplification of the criteria with fewer required MRI examinations. 
2.1.5.  Management 
Currently there is no cure for MS, but the aberrant activation of self-specific T and B cells observed in MS has 
been shown to be affected by immunomodulatory treatments, which can favourable alter the course of the 
disease. These therapeutic interventions are referred to as disease modifying drugs (DMDs). The goal of 
treatment of RMS with DMDs is to reduce the rate and severity of relapses and to delay disease progression 
by preventing accumulation of disability. 
MS therapies also include symptomatic treatment applied to improve symptoms and complications caused by 
the disease, e.g. fatigue, spasticity, ataxia, walking disability, weakness, bladder and bowel disturbances, 
and cognition disturbances etc. Furthermore, acute relapses can be treated with corticosteroids and the 
standard of care is methylprednisolone i.v. 
There are number of approved DMDs with different efficacy and safety profiles for the treatment of RRMS. 
Glatiramer acetate and interferon-beta (INF-ß) are considered as having a relatively mild-moderate effect 
(relative reduction by 30-40% of annualised relapse rate [ARR]) but on the other hand having rather benign 
safety profiles. Some INF-ß products are having broad indications including RRMS patients, patients with a 
single demyelinating event and SPMS patients with relapses (e.g. Betaferon, Extavia). Despite a rather 
benign safety profile, intramuscular (i.m.) or subcutaneous (s.c.) administration every other day (e.g. 
Betaferon) or once a week (Avonex) often cause local administration-related adverse drug reactions affecting 
the acceptability and compliance to the treatment. 
Other recently approved medicines like dimethylfumarate and teriflunomide are indicated for patients with 
RRMS and are considered to have modest efficacy (reduction of ARR approximately by 50% for 
dimethylfumarate and by 30% for teriflunomide). Despite convenient way of administration (per os [p.o.] 
once or twice daily), these medications have a more complex safety profile. Teriflunomide reduces white 
blood cell count approximately by 15 % from baseline values, requires frequent monitoring of liver function 
(every two weeks during the first 6 months of treatment, and every 8 weeks thereafter) and has very slow 
Assessment report

Page 9/131 
  
  
plasma elimination, which could take up to 2 years. Dimethylfumarate lowers lymphocyte counts by 
approximately 30% from baseline values and cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) 
have occurred in patients with moderate or severe prolonged lymphopenia. Daclizumab is also indicated for 
patients with RRMS and has moderate efficacy (approximately 46% relative reduction of ARR). It also induces 
reduction of total lymphocyte, T and B cell counts on average ≤10% from baseline during the first year of 
treatment. 
Alemtuzumab is indicated for ‘RRMS patients with active disease defined by clinical or imaging features’, 
while natalizumab and fingolimod have been approved for ‘highly active RRMS’.  Disease activity was defined 
based on clinical and MRI parameters with or without prior DMD. Alemtuzumab is administered as 
intravenous (i.v.) infusions during two treatment courses lasting 3-5 days each and separated by 12 months 
with safety follow up for 48 months after the last infusion (relative reduction of ARR by approximately 50%). 
Infusion related reactions, infections as well as autoimmune disorders including immune thrombocytopenia, 
nephropathies and thyroid disorders (up to 36% of treated patients) were reported in clinical trials with 
alemtuzumab. Alemtuzumab depletes T and B lymphocytes and total lymphocyte counts return to lower limit 
of normal by 6 months after the last infusion in 40% of patients.  
Natalizumab is administered as i.v. infusion every 4 weeks. It is very effective in highly active RRMS (relative 
reduction of ARR by approximately 70%). In contrast to other treatment alternatives in MS it is not inducing 
lymphopenia, but is associated with seriously increased risk of PML (varies from 0.1 to 10 per 1000 treated 
patient).  
Fingolimod is another alternative for patients with highly active RRMS (relative reduction of ARR by 
approximately 50-55%). However, it induces reduction of the peripheral lymphocyte count by approximately 
70-80% from baseline value. Fingolimod is also associated with the occurrence of PML cases, basal cell 
cancer and serious cardiac adverse reactions including bradycardia, as well as cases of QT prolongation and 
atrioventricular block. 
In summary, available treatment alternatives for highly active RRMS patients are relatively limited and even 
it these options are effective, the substantial safety concerns limit their use. Furthermore, in spite of a 
number of approved drugs for the treatment of RRMS, there is still an unmet medical need for treatment 
options which are easy to use for the patient, e.g. oral administration and/or short treatment courses, and 
which have high efficacy with a benign safety profile. 
About the product 
Cladribine (2-chloro-2′-deoxyadenosine, 2-CdA) is a nucleoside analogue of deoxyadenosine. It belongs to 
the class of antimetabolites and was initially developed as a synthetic anti-neoplastic agent for the treatment 
of lymphoid malignancies. It is approved in the European Union (EU)/European Economic Area (EEA) under 
the trade name Litak® as a solution for injection for the treatment of hairy-cell leukaemia. In contrast to that, 
MAVENCLAD was developed as an oral formulation of cladribine to improve patient adherence and 
compliance. 
Cladribine is a prodrug, which is activated after intracellular phosphorylation to 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine 
(CdATP). Cladribine through its active metabolite exerts reversible selective depletion of lymphocytes, which 
are thought to underlie the autoimmune processes involved in MS pathophysiology (see section 2.4.3. for a 
description of the mechanism of action).

Cladribine appears as a white to off-white, non-hygroscopic, crystalline powder. It is slightly soluble in water 
and methanol and practically insoluble in acetonitrile.Its pka was found to be 1.21. Partition coefficient (logP) 
of 0.0595 was determined at pH 7. Cladribine is stable at slightly basic and at neutral pH. 
Cladribine is a molecule with three stereogenic centres. Two stereoisomers are possible, 9-α and 9-β 
stereoisomer. Cladribine is the 9-β stereoisomer and is controlled by optical rotation according to the current 
Ph. Eur. monograph.  
Cladribine exhibits polymorphism. At least two polymorphs are known. The XRPD patterns of all cladribine 
batches manufactured to date are consistent with the same polymorph. In addition no interconversion of the 
produced form into another polymorph has been observed.  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of 
the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
The manufacturing process for cladribine active substance comprises two chemical steps and one purification 
step.  The starting materials have been sufficiently justified, are well-defined and adequately controlled by 
acceptable specifications.   
Critical steps and critical process parameters have been identified. Adequate in-process controls are applied 
during the synthesis.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. The fate and carry over of genotoxic impurities have been discussed 
satisfactorily.  
The active substance is packed in two low density polyethylene (LDPE) bags (primary packaging material) 
inside a polyethylene drum and lid, which are constructed of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) (secondary 
packaging). All components used as primary packaging material are food grade and comply with the 
requirements of Ph. Eur. and European Directive 10/2011 as amended.  
Specification 
The active substance specification includes appropriate tests and limits for appearance (visual), identity (IR, 
Ph. Eur.), appearance of a solution (Ph. Eur.), pH of solution, specific rotation (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals, 
residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), water content (Ph. Eur.), assay (Ph. Eur.), purity (HPLC, TLC, Ph. Eur.), 
residual solvents (GC), residual ammonia (ion chromatographic) and bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.). 
The specification of the active substance complies with the requirements in the Ph. Eur. monograph. The 
specified limits for genotoxic impurities are considered acceptable considering the indication and are in line 
with ICH M7 Guideline. The overall control strategy for the related impurities is acceptable; sufficient 
information has been provided on the control of the potential impurities (including genotoxic) and to 
demonstrate that potential impurities arising from the described route of synthesis are adequately removed.  
The omission of a specific identification test for polymorphism has been satisfactorily justified considering 
that no interconversion has been observed and that the polymorphic form is not a critical quality attribute 
because cladribine is dissolved in the manufacture of the finished product.

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and compendial methods have been adopted 
where applicable. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from three production scale batches of the active substance were provided. The results 
are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three pilot and seven production scale batches of cladribine from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial package up to 60 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) 
and intermediate conditions (30 ºC / 65% RH) has been provided according to the ICH guidelines. Pilot and 
production scale batches have been stored under accelerated condition (40 ºC / 75% RH) for 6 months. 
Results are all within specifications through the 24 month time point at 30 °C /65% RH condition. 
Samples for the pilot scale batches were tested for appearance, moisture, specific optical rotation, assay and 
purity by HPLC. Samples for appearance, appearance of solution (clarity and color), water content, assay by 
HPLC and purity by HPLC and TLC were tested for the production scale batches. The analytical methods and 
acceptance criteria are the same as applied for release testing and have been shown to be stability indicating. 
The stability of the polymorphic form of cladribine was also verified by XRPD analyses and it remains 
unchanged during 36 months of storage under the long term conditions and 3 months of storage under the 
accelerated conditions.  
Results on stress conditions of two batches (heat, humidity, basic, acidic, and oxidation studies) were also 
provided. The conclusion of the forced degradation studies was that cladribine is a stable molecule. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed as part of forced degradation study on 
one batch. The results showed that cladribine is not sensitive to light. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months of cladribine with no special 
storage conditions in the proposed container closure system. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as white, round and biconvex immediate release tablet, intended for oral 
administration. Each tablet contains 10 mg cladribine, sorbitol, hydroxypropyl betadex and magnesium 
stearate.  
The aim of the pharmaceutical development strategy was to achieve a solid oral dosage form with high 
bioavailability for cladribine.  The quality target product profile has been presented. 
Cladribine active substance (AS) is classified as BCS class III compound (low permeability, high solubility). It 
is unstable in acidic media therefore initial formulations were designed to protect cladribine from the acidic 
conditions of the stomach and to ensure maximum drug bioavailability. Therefore, several different types of 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 13/131 
  
  
 
formulations have been were developed and evaluated. The cladribine / hydroxypropyl betadex oral tablet 
formulation showed the most favourable PK profile and the lowest variability in the PK parameters estimated. 
The oral route of administration was pursued investigating two types of cyclodextrins. 
Complexation with hydroxypropyl betadex (synonym: 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, HPβCD) was 
selected and the process of complex formation was optimised (ratio and reaction temperature). The 
cladribine / hydroxypropyl betadex complex ratio was defined based on complexation studies at different 
ratios. Hydroxypropyl betadex is approved in Europe as food additive with an acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 
5 mg/kg/day. The amount of hydroxypropyl betadex per tablet is well below the ADI. The excipient 
properties was considered to be critical material attributes with regard to the quality of the finished product 
have been presented. Cladribine / hydroxypropyl betadex complex was characterised by Powder X-Ray 
Diffraction (PXRD), Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), solid-state Cross Polarization Magic Angle 
Spinning (CP-MAS) NMR and for properties in solution. The cladribine-hydroxypropyl betadex complex has 
been sufficiently characterised and its stability has been demonstrated. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. The choice and function of the 
excipients in the formulation has been justified. Their material attributes (physical, chemical, microbiological 
properties) were assessed applying a risk assessment for their criticality to the product quality following the 
recommendations of ICH Q8.  
The compatibility of cladribine with the excipients is demonstrated by stability studies carried out for 
cladribine finished product. No significant changes or variability over time and no degradation of cladribine or 
increase of degradation products was observed; therefore cladribine is regarded compatible with all the 
excipients employed. 
The changes to formulation used for the Phase I/II/III clinical trials were presented. The excipients are 
qualitatively the same and quantitatively very similar compared to the clinical formulation. Bioavailability 
trials confirmed that the PK parameters were not affected by the changes in formulation during the 
development phases. The in vitro dissolution profiles of the commercial and clinical formulation showed very 
rapid dissolution and are similar across the pH range 1.2-6.8.  
The choice of the dissolution method has been satisfactorily justified. The sink conditions were verified. The 
discriminatory power of a dissolution test method was evaluated by comparing several batches of different 
formulations and produced by different manufacturing processes. The provided dissolution data 
demonstrates that the dissolution method is discriminatory for differences in formulation and manufacturing 
processes. 
Manufacturing process development for the formulation as well as for the commercial formulation was 
initiated at one manufacturing site and was subsequently transferred to the proposed site, where process 
validation studies were performed. The process is considered successfully transferred and the robustness of 
the process has been confirmed. 
The tablet formulation was developed using a complexation technique where the complex is pre-milled, 
sieved and blended with excipients. The final blend is compressed into tablets. The complexation step was 
optimised with regard to hydroxypropyl betadex ratio, complexation time and temperature. The blending 
process has also been evaluated and optimised with regard to the relevant process parameters.During 
process transfer some further modifications in the manufacturing process were implemented. The process 
changes implemented were mainly due to the different batch size, while the process parameters remained 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 14/131 
  
  
essentially unchanged. These minor modifications ensure a more robust production process in terms of 
improved compressibility. 
The critical process parameters (CPPs) of the finished product manufacturing process were re-assessed at the 
proposed manufacturing site. The risk ranking method was presented and includes justification for the risk 
classification. CPPs have been identified for all the manufacturing steps. 
The primary packaging of Cladribine 10 mg immediate release tablets is OPA/ Al /PVC – aluminium blisters 
(oriented polyamide/ aluminium/ polyvinyl chloride – aluminium blisters) which are sealed in a cardboard 
wallet and fixed in a child-resistant carton. The primary packaging is of food grade and complies with Ph.Eur. 
and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
A usability study on the child-resistant packaging has also been submitted involving patients with mild or 
moderate dexterity impairments and testing all the handling steps that patients should perform in order to 
open the packaging and retrieve a tablet.  In general the results showed that patients rated that packaging 
gets easier to open after each use (i.e. they become more experienced with the method to open the 
packaging). In addition, the testing shows that even under circumstances where patients either do not read 
the instructions or misunderstand them, the packaging is still intuitive enough that the tablet can be 
extracted. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The  manufacturing  process  for  cladribine  drug  product  comprises  main  steps:  complexation,  pre-milling, 
sieving/blending, compression, and packaging. 
The  manufacturing  process  follows  the  conventional  approach  for  solid  dosage  forms,  employing  standard 
equipment  and  it  can  be  considered  as  a  standard  process.  Holding  time  for  cladribine  bulk  tablets  in  a 
suitable container was established. Critical process steps have been identified and the respective CPPs were 
defined to control the critical steps. The IPCs during the manufacturing process have been presented and are 
adequately  justified.  The  control  strategy  ensures  that  the  manufacturing  process  consistently  delivers  a 
product that meets the defined criteria for all release specifications. 
Process validation data comprise a range of studies including among others three commercial scale batches. 
In conclusion, it has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is sufficiently robust to provide 
assurance that immediate release tablets of consistent quality, complying with the designated specification, 
are produced. 
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests and limits for appearance 
(visual), dimensions, identification by retention time (RP-HPLC), identification by UV spectrum (RP-HPLC), 
assay (RP-HPLC), degradation products (RP-HPLC), elemental impurities (ICP-MS), water content (Ph. Eur.), 
dissolution (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units (HPLC, Ph. Eur.), and microbiological purity (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and validated in accordance with the ICH 
guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used in the routine analysis of finished 
product has been presented. 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 15/131 
  
  
Batch analysis data for a large number of batches (production and pilot scale) manufactured with the 
proposed commercial formulation of cladribine were presented. All batches are representative of the process 
and the results show that the finished product meets the proposed specification limits.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 5 commercial, 4 pilot and one laboratory scale batches of the finished product have been 
conducted in line with the ICH Stability Guidelines under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH for up to 36 
months, under 30 ºC / 75% RH for up to 24 months and accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH for 6 
months. Appropriate post-approval stability commitments are provided. The stability batches are identical to 
those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Stability of cladribine bulk tablets when stored in the proposed container closure system (double low-density 
PE bags, with desiccant in between the two bags, placed in high-density polyethylene drums) has also been 
investigated. The proposed holding time is considered adequately supported by presented data.  
The following parameters were investigated: description, water content, assay, related substances, 
dissolution test and microbial purity. The analytical procedures used for stability testing are the same as 
intended for release and are stability-indicating. No significant change in any of the tested parameters was 
observed during the study, as all the parameters tested met the acceptance criteria for all samples stored at 
long term and accelerated storage conditions. No trends were observed. 
A photostability study was conducted on one production scale batch according to ICH Q1B Guideline. No 
significant change was observed in any of the tested parameters (appearance, identification, assay, 
degradation products, water content and dissolution) and the results confirm that the product is not 
photosensitive and no storage restriction against light is found necessary. 
A thermal cycling study was performed with cladribine tablets packaged in aluminum/aluminium blisters to 
evaluate the effect of short-term excursions outside the proposed label storage condition that might occur 
during shipping. All stability data obtained after thermal cycling met the requirements of the shelf-life 
specification. No significant differences were observed for all parameters tested. The data are in line with the 
proposed shelf-life for the finished product. 
Based on the provided stability data, the proposed shelf life of 36 months stored in the original package in 
order to protect from moisture, as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
There are no materials of human or animal origin used in the manufacture of the finished product. 
Satisfactory TSE/BSE certificates are provided covering the synthesis of hydroxypropyl betadex. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Cladribine is a synthetic chlorinated analogue of the naturally occurring nucleoside deoxyadenosine, first 
developed for treatment of leukaemia and used for many years with parenteral formulations in patients with 
hairy cell leukaemia. An oral formulation (10mg tablets) was later developed for the treatment of MS. 
The non-clinical development programme consisted of a battery of primary, secondary and safety 
pharmacology studies as well PK and toxicology studies and comprised various species including mice, rats, 
guinea pigs, dogs, and monkeys. Initial in vivo non-clinical studies were performed by IP, IV or SC routes. 
Later studies were conducted by oral route to support the advanced clinical development and marketing 
application for oral cladribine in MS patients. 
All safety pharmacology, toxicology and toxicokinetic studies, as well as one secondary pharmacology study 
(in vivo study in dogs to evaluate cladribine effects on coagulation and platelets) were conducted in 
accordance with Good Laboratory Practice. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
The T cell dependent, relapsing/remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model was 
chosen as a rodent model for MS in order to assess the potential of cladribine to reduce clinical symptoms of 
MS. The effects of cladribine on EAE were evaluated in two experiments in female SJL/J mice which were 
sensitized with whole mouse spinal cord homogenate in complete Freund’s adjuvant and injected 
subsequently with pertussis toxin. In one experiment a total of 5 mg/kg cladribine was injected divided in five 
intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections (1mg/kg/day) after induction of EAE. In a second experiment cladribine was 
injected IV to three groups of EAE mice on day 0-9 with a total dose ranging from 5.0 – 30.0 mg/kg. All mice 
were evaluated for clinical signs of EAE. Furthermore, immunological and histological samples were collected. 
As clinical signs of EAE emerged within ten days after sensitization, samples were taken at day eight and at 
day fourteen. In neither of the studies cladribine exerted measurable effects on clinical signs of EAE.

EMA/435731/2017 
Page 17/131 
  
  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
For the prediction of non-specific off-target binding of cladribine, 115 cell receptors, ion channels and 
enzymes were investigated in various in vitro receptor binding and enzyme assays. None of the investigated 
off-targets were affected to more than 50% at 10 µM cladribine except for the adenosine receptor A1. 
Furthermore, PDE2A and PDE4D were inhibited by 62% compared to control by cladribine. The IC50 values 
were higher compared to the expected exposure at the proposed human clinical dose in MS patients, and but 
no related signals (CNS, vomiting) were found in the non-clinical studies (see below). The clinical safety 
relevance of the in vitro results was thus considered not relevant. 
Cladribine is structurally related to the endogeneous ligand adenosine. Therefore, and in light of the 
aforementioned results of receptor ligand binding assays, the affinity of cladribine for adenosine receptors A1, 
A2 and A3 were investigated on both rat and human material. Furthermore, the effects on adenosine uptake 
were investigated under in vitro conditions (guinea-pig). Compared to selective ligands for these receptor 
sites cladribine showed weak affinities to both adenosine receptors and the adenosine uptake site. The 
studies on human receptors demonstrated binding of cladribine to the hA1 receptor with Ki values of 1.5µM 
(agonistic radio-ligand) and 11µM (antagonistic radio-ligand). Less affinity was observed for hA2 and hA3 
receptors. Overall, binding to adenosine receptors was only seen at concentrations well above clinical plasma 
concentrations found with therapeutic doses (22 –29 ng/ml in human plasma).   
As part of general pharmacology studies the effects of cladribine on blood coagulation system (prothrombin 
time, activated partial thromboplastin, fibrinogen concentration), blood clotting time, ADP-induced platelet 
aggregation and haemolytic effects were studied using blood of rabbits and in vivo studies in dogs. At 
concentrations between 0.1 – 100 µM no effect was observed. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The tests included the assessment of effects on cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous system (CNS) 
and were supplemented by gastrointestinal and renal in vivo studies.  
In vitro, a slight effect on hERG tail current in HEK-293 cells stably transfected with hERG cDNA was 
observed at 10-4 M cladribine. No effects on action potential duration, in particular at 90% of repolarization, 
were observed at concentrations ranging from 10-7 to 10-4 M in isolated canine purkinje fibers. This 
conclusion was supported by the results of a 3-month toxicology study in monkeys (oral or SC 
administration), which also did not show any effect on the duration of the heart rate-corrected QT interval. 
In vivo cardiac safety was furthermore investigated in dogs and monkeys. In anaesthetised dogs, cladribine 
was investigated after cumulative IV administration of 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5 and 10 mg/kg. A slight decrease in 
systolic and diastolic systemic arterial blood pressure at doses ≥1 mg/kg coupled with an increase in heart 
rate and cardiac output at doses ≥0.5 mg/kg was observed. Furthermore, increased respiratory rate and 
volume were observed at doses ≥0.5 mg/kg. In awake dogs, on the contrary, oral administration of 
cladribine (80 mg/animal) did not induce any effect on heart rate, mean systolic and diastolic systemic 
arterial blood pressure. No ECG changes were seen and respiratory rate and rectal temperature did not 
change following administration of cladribine. Cladribine exposure in dogs (mean Cmax = 1775 ng/mL) was 
about 30 fold higher than the exposure in patients after oral administration of two 10 mg tablets for patients 
with a body weight ≥60 kg (i.e. maximum recommended human daily dose).  
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 18/131 
  
  
Cladribine had no effect on various different parameters addressing the function of the CNS in mice or rats 
after i.v. administration of 5 or 10 mg/kg. Additionally, no effects on gastrointestinal and renal function were 
seen up to 10 mg/kg IV.  
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Cladribine is intended as a monotherapy. Therefore, no specific pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies 
were performed, which was considered acceptable. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics (PK) 
The PK profile of cladribine was evaluated in vitro as well as in vivo. In vivo PK and toxicokinetic studies were 
performed in mice, rats, dogs and monkeys after oral administration, which is the intended route for human 
use, and in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and monkeys after parenteral administration (SC and/or IV). In addition, 
blood plasma (mouse, rat, dog, monkey, human), hepatic microsomes and hepatocytes (rat, human) were 
utilised for metabolism studies. Analytical methods used for determination of plasma (mice, rats, rabbit, dog, 
monkey) urine (monkeys) concentration of cladribine and its major metabolites were validated and assessed.  
Absorption studies have been done with different formulations of cladribine (cladribine in HPβCD water 
solution, HPβCD-tablets or capsules, cladribine dissolved in isotonic saline). Rate and extent of absorption of 
cladribine after oral administration were studied in rodents, dogs and monkeys. Oral bioavailability was 
determined for mice, rats and monkeys with the IV route as reference. Absorption was rapid in all species 
with a maximum plasma concentration (cmax) generally observed within 1h after administration, but the 
absolute bioavailability varied among the species: The highest values were found in mice (56%) and dogs 
(45%), whereas the values were lower in rats (27%) and monkeys (11%). Exposure to cladribine after oral 
dosing increased roughly in proportion to the increase in dose. No accumulation of the parent compound was 
found after repeated administration over 3 months.  
In vitro plasma protein binding of cladribine in rats, dogs and monkeys was rather low (10 to 20%). 
Distribution in mice, monkeys and human whole blood showed that cladribine was almost equally distributed 
between blood cells and plasma. After i.v. administration of cladribine, the calculated volume of distribution 
at steady state was equivalent to about 2-3 fold the total body water in rats, dogs and monkeys indicating an 
extensive distribution into the tissues. Quantitative whole body autoradiography after SC administration of 3H 
cladribine to mice showed that radioactivity was rapidly and widely distributed into most of the tissues, 
including the brain. Tissue distribution was rapid with a predominance of well-perfused organs and 
subsequently excretion organs including the gastrointestinal tract and bladder. Data in both dogs and 
monkeys also show that cladribine has the ability to distribute to the cerebrospinal fluid.   
Following incubation of [14C]-2-chlorodeoxyadenosine in hepatocyte cultures for 24 hours, the extent of 
metabolism was medium to low in all species (monkey, rabbit, rat, dog, mouse and human). The major 
routes of biotransformation were similar across the species but rather low in quantities and involved oxidative 
cleavage of adenine-deoxyribose bond to 2-chloroadenine, which was further oxidized, most likely via N-
oxidation or hydroxylation at the pyrimidine moiety. Parent compound also underwent N-oxidation or 
hydroxylation. In addition, four glucuronide conjugates of 2-chloroadenine were observed in varying amounts 
across the species and are likely to be a mixture of N- and O-glucuronides. In whole blood, after incubation of 
10 μM [14C]-cladribine for up to 24 h, cladribine was extensively metabolized. Prominent metabolites included 
2-chlorohypoxanthine in human and monkey plasma (43% of the total radioactivity) and the corresponding 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 19/131 
  
  
nucleoside 2-chlorodeoxyinosine (14 to 18%). In human and monkey blood cells the main constituent was 2-
chlorohypoxanthine besides parent drug with about remaining 23 to 25% of total radioactivity. 
In vivo, unchanged cladribine and up to 10 metabolites were identified in plasma, red blood cells, urine and 
faeces in mouse and monkey with similar metabolic profiles between species. No human mass balance study 
was performed, but given the very short exposure of the parent drug (2 treatment weeks per year one 
month apart), the rapid excretion (see below) and the similarity between the urine metabolites in mouse, 
monkey and human, this was accepted. 
The elimination of cladribine from plasma after parenteral administration was rapid in mouse, rat and rabbit 
with terminal plasma disposition half-life (t 1/2) values of 1.28, 0.92 and 0.64 hours, respectively, but slower 
in monkeys and dogs with a half-life of about 5.7 and 10.3 hours, respectively. After oral administration, 
cladribine elimination was in general relatively rapid in mice (t 1/2=1.17h), rats (t 1/2=1.16h), dogs 
(t 1/2=13.7h) and monkeys (t 1/2=3.6h). The mean systemic clearance after parenteral administration was 
moderate in rabbits (15.2 mL/min/kg) and moderate to high in monkeys (21.5 mL/min/kg) while it was high 
in mice, rats and dogs (70 mL/min/kg, 48.6 and 24.4 mL/min/kg respectively). In humans, systemic 
clearance was around 45.4 L/h and was considered as moderate to high. 
Results indicated that urinary excretion was the primary route of elimination for cladribine in the mouse. 
Approximately 74% of the 3H labelled dose was recovered in urine, faeces, and carcasses during a 96-hour 
period. Elimination appeared to be rapid, with approximately 62% of the administered radioactivity excreted 
in urine during the first 24 hours post-dose in both males and females. A biliar excretion study was not 
performed.  In humans, elimination was also rapid with 59% of administered dose recovered unchanged in 
urine in the 0-24h fractions. 
Studies related to possible drug–drug interactions have been done at the level of absorption and metabolism, 
respectively. Collectively, cytochrome (CYP) P450 mediated biotransformation of cladribine is considered of 
minor significance. Only very limited metabolism was observed at all concentration levels tested. Only 
incubation with CYPP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 minor cladribine transformation was detected (1%, 2-
chloroadine). Furthermore, in human hepatocytes there was no evidence of any cladribine derived induction 
of the major CYP P450 enzymes, i.e CYP1A2 and CYP3A4 (including 2C9 and 2C19). Likewise, no marked 
inhibitory interactions were observed with CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4 in human liver 
microsomes was observed at concentrations of up to 10 µM.  
Cladribine did not display any significant in vivo systemic inhibition potential of important transporter-
proteins [P-gp (ABCB1), BCRP (ABCG2), MRP2 (ABCC2), MRP4 (ABCC4), MRP5 (ABCC5), OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, 
OAT4]. Similarly, a significant in vivo inhibition of the hepatic uptake transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 
seems unlikely. Furthermore, significant alterations of transporter-functions at the intestinal level are 
considered unlikely for BCRP (ABCG2), and P-gp (ABCB1) at the clinical dose level. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The nonclinical toxicology profile of cladribine was characterized in a number of studies by parenteral and oral 
administration, including single-dose and repeat-dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive and 
developmental toxicity, local tolerance, antigenicity studies and studies on the excipient 
hydroxypropylbetadex (HPßCD) and on the metabolite 2-chloroadenine. Studies were conducted in both 
rodent (mice, rats) and non-rodent species (dog, cynomolgus monkey).  
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 20/131 
  
  
A summary of the studies is provided below with a focus on the studies using the intended route of 
administration (oral).  
Single dose toxicity 
Single dose toxicity studies have been performed with cladribine administered by IV or SC route to mice, rats 
and dogs. Mortality was observed at cladribine doses ranging from about 100 to 200 mg/kg regardless of the 
route of administration. The highest non-lethal dose in mice was 90 and 150 mg/kg by IV and SC routes, 
respectively. In rats the highest non-lethal dose was 48 mg/kg in males and 96 mg/kg in females by i.v. 
route and 100 mg/kg by s.c. route in both males and females. The main clinical signs observed at these 
doses consisted of prostration, decrease in activity and piloerection. In dogs, neither lethality nor clinical 
changes (except for foamy emesis) were seen after a single IV dose of 25 mg/kg, the highest feasible dose. 
Repeat dose toxicity  
The initial repeat-dose studies were conducted by i.v. or s.c. route using a daily dosing regimen or cyclic 
regimen. The pivotal studies designed to evaluate the repeat-dose toxicity of cladribine were conducted in 
mice and monkeys that are considered appropriate species due to similarities in plasma deoxycytidine level 
profile to humans. 
Repeated dose toxicity studies including toxicokinetic investigations were performed after both parenteral and 
oral administration in mice and cynomolgus monkey. The species were chosen due to similarities in plasma 
deoxycytidine (DKC) levels compared to humans, given that DKC can compete for enzymatic binding sites of 
cladribine within cells). Generally, the toxic effects observed in mice and monkeys were dose-dependent and 
reversible. The main symptoms observed in the studies were anaemia, leucopenia, lymphoid depletion of 
lymphoid system (spleen, thymus and lymph nodes) and bone marrow cellular depletion. Longer 
administration of cladribine at 1 mg/kg/day had also effects on the kidney (karyomegaly of renal tubular 
epithelium) and adrenals (adrenal cortex atrophy and decreased vacuolation). Additional microscopic changes 
were observed in the animals sacrificed early and included atrophy of gastric and small intestinal mucosa and 
testicular degeneration. Therefore, the target organs were the immune system (at 0.3 mg/kg/day), bone 
marrow, skin, mucous membranes, and testes (≥ 0.6 mg/kg/day) and kidneys (≥ 1 mg/kg/day).  
Safety margins (at least a factor of 1.6) were established based on the extrapolated exposure at the no-
observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) versus the projected human exposure at the anticipated oral clinical 
dose (i.e. 10 mg tablet/day corresponding to 0.175 mg/kg/day for a person of around 55-60 kg). No toxic 
effects were observed when cladribine was administered by oral route up to 20 mg/kg/day in mice and up to 
6 mg/kg/days in cynomolgus monkeys, respectively. The daily exposure associated to these NOAELs 
exceeded the daily human exposure at the oral clinical dose (10 mg /day) by a factor of at least 3.9-fold 
based on AUC0-24 and 8.2-fold based on projected cumulative AUC0-∞ (200 mg/year). Both values refer to the 
NOAEL found in monkeys. 
Furthermore, as HPßCD has previously been described to induce an increase in tumours of the exocrine 
pancreas in a carcinogenicity study, the application included a dedicated repeat-dose study in mice of the 
excipient alone in order to establish the relevance of the finding in relation to the proposed formulation and 
posology. The NOAEL with the cyclical regimen was 500 mg/kg/day corresponding to about 100 times the 
daily dose for a person weighing 60 kg and taking two 10 mg tablets. 
Genotoxicity 
The genotoxic potential of cladribine was tested in standard in vitro and in vivo tests. Cladribine was negative 
in bacterial and mammalian mutations assays and did not induce unscheduled DNA synthesis. However, it 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 21/131 
  
  
was shown to be genotoxic, causing chromosomal damage in the bone marrow of mice in vivo and in Chinese 
hamster ovary-wbl cells in vitro. These findings are not unexpected, since cladribine inhibits DNA repair and 
causes DNA double strand breaks. Cladribine did not induce gene mutations but it was clastogenic in 
mammalian cells. 
Carcinogenicity 
Cladribine was tested for its carcinogenic potential in a single 22-month study in mice (s.c., up to 
10mg/kg/day). Additionally, a 26-week transgenic bioassay in transgenic rasH2 mice (TgrasH2, 
administration by oral gavage, 5, 15 and 30 mg/kg/day) was conducted.  
A significant increase in Harderian gland tumours was observed in the long-term mouse study at a dose of 
10mg/kg/day. Although the majority of the tumours were benign adenomas, there were also three 
adenocarcinomas. No histomorphological signs of progression states to adenocarcinomas were found in any 
of the adenomas observed. This occurrence is not considered to have clinical relevance, as humans do not 
have a comparable anatomical structure (Carlton, 1991). No cladribine-related neoplastic findings were 
observed in TgrasH2 mice at any dose tested, either with cladribine tablet or with cladribine drug substance. 
Preliminary tumour findings in a dose-range study are considered as having occurred by chance.  
Reproduction Toxicity 
Studies investigating the effects of cladribine on male and female fertility in mice, embryofoetal development 
in mice and rabbits, and pre- and postnatal development were performed. The routes of administration were 
SC and IV. As these routes ensure high systemic administration, the lack of oral studies was accepted. 
In males, testes weights and the percentage of motile sperms were significantly decreased by cladribine at 
30 mg/kg/day. Testicular effects (marked testicular atrophy and the complete absence of spermatogenesis) 
have also been observed in one out of two monkeys in a repeated dose study after SC dosing of cladribine at 
1 mg/kg/day. Testicular (non-neoplastic) effects were also observed in the oral 26-week carcinogenicity 
study in TgrasH2 mice with cladribine tablets at 30 mg/kg/day consisting of reduced testes weights and 
degeneration of seminifeorus tubules or signs of atrophy of germinal epithelium. No effects were observed by 
cladribine up to 30 mg/kg on male libido or fertility. Given the mechanism of action of cladribine, together 
with these data, the potential of cladribine to affect male fertility in humans seems likely. When male mice 
had been treated with cladribine four weeks prior to mating and throughout mating, single instances of 
embryos with skeletal malformations similar to those found in the embryofoetal development studies in mice 
and rabbits were observed.  
Early embryo development was studied in mice at dosed up to 8 mg/kg/day (SC). Embryotoxicity was 
observed at the high dose group only, without maternal toxicity. NOAELs were determined to be 4 mg/kg/day 
(embryo) and 8 mg/kg/day (dams). Embryofetal development effects in mice and rabbits of i.v. 
administration of cladribine was also studied. In mice, the NOAEL for embryofetal development was 
0.5 mg/kg, whereas maternal NOAEL was 3.0 mg/kg/day. Maternal NOAEL was similar in rabbits 
(3.0 mg/kg/day), whereas the NOAEL for the embryofetal development was 1.0 mg/kg/day.   
In the pre- and postnatal development cladribine induced lethal effects in the offspring of mice at all stages 
of in utero development and was clearly teratogenic in mice and rabbits. Skeletal malformations were 
confirmed in a subset of pups. However, surviving pups did not show any effect on postnatal development 
including attainment of developmental milestones, behaviour, learning and reproductive functions.  
No juvenile toxicity studies were performed as cladribine is only intended for use in adults.

Local Tolerance  
Local tolerability studies were done using Syrian golden hamster treated in the cheek pouch, single dose SC 
irritation in mouse, intra and para-venous injection in rabbits, and intra-arterial injection in rabbits. The 
results of these irritation studies did not indicate any concerns about the clinical use of this compound by 
these routes of administration. 
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity of cladribine was studied in guinea pigs. In the active systemic anaphylaxis and the passive 
cutaneous anaphylaxis tests, cladribine did not show any antigenic potential. Analysis of the ultraviolet 
absorption spectrum showed that cladribine did not absorb light within the range of natural sunlight (290-
700 nm). No concern for direct phototoxicity was identified and no further studies evaluating the phototoxic 
potential of cladribine were performed.  
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An environmental risk assessment (ERA) according to Guideline EMEA/CHMP/4447/00 was provided. The n-
octanol-water partition coefficient (log K ow) for cladribine was 0.0595 at pH=7 (OECD 107; Lange, 2009). 
The predicted environmental concentration in surface-water (PECsurfacewater)  was calculated at 0.00027 µg/L 
based on a refined market penetration factor (Fpen) taking into account the proposed treatment regime 
(maximum of 10 treatment days per year, 20 treatment days in total over two years and dosing up to 20 
mg/treatment day). Notably, cladribine is also approved for the treatment of hairy cell leukemia and the 
combined PECsurfacewater for both indications is 0.00028 µg/L.

Therefore cladribine is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Cladribine is a well-known active substance with the ability to induce apoptosis in lymphocytes and used for 
the treatment of hairy cell leukaemia. Cladribine was extensively investigated in a variety of non-clinical 
studies aimed to characterize the pharmacological and PK profile as well as with regards to safety and 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 23/131 
  
  
 
 
toxicology. Safety pharmacology, toxicology and toxicokinetic studies conducted were done in accordance 
with GLP. 
In general, the pharmacology, PK, safety pharmacology and toxicology program was considered adequate to 
support the present application.  
The experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model was chosen as a rodent model for MS. In this 
model the applicant was unable to show exerted measurable effects on clinical signs of EAE or on 
histopathological and immunological parameters. It is speculated that this might be due to pharmacogenetic 
differences between rodents and humans affecting PK and pharmacodynamics (PD). It is hypothesized that 
the levels of cladribine (and of its active triphosphate form) necessary to suppress an immune response was 
either not achieved or not sustained for sufficient time to have an effect. While this explanation remains 
speculative, taking into consideration the limited predictive value of the EAE model, the missing proof of 
concept did not raise further concerns given the available evidence of efficacy from clinical trials (see sections 
2.4.3. and 2.5. ). 
In anaesthetized beagle dogs a slight decrease in systolic and diastolic systemic arterial blood pressure at 
doses ≥1 mg/kg coupled with an increase in heart rate and cardiac output at doses ≥0.5 mg/kg was 
observed. In a new study, performed in awake dogs, cladribine did not induce any effect on cardiovascular 
parameters. In this study the exposure was about 30 fold higher than the exposure in patients. The 
applicants speculates that the difference between anaesthetized and awake dogs in relation to the 
cardiovascular effects could be due to the presence of compensatory mechanisms in awake dogs and the 
mode of application in the study performed in awake dogs (oral) compared to anaesthetized animals (IV) and 
subsequent different PK profiles. It is agreed with the applicant that these are possible explanations and that 
the newly performed study in awake dogs is of greater relevance than the study performed in anaesthetized 
dogs. Based on these data it seems that the potential of cladribine to elicit cardiotoxic effects under 
therapeutic conditions is low. 
The additional safety pharmacology screening did not reveal any alterations including absence of any adverse 
CNS effect. The results of these studies support a considerable safety margin compared to doses and 
exposures intended for human use. 
Data pertaining to the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion of cladribine have been gathered in 
a series of studies conducted in mice, rats, rabbits, dogs and monkeys via three routes of administration: IV, 
SC and oral. Absorption was rapid in all species but oral bioavailability was clearly different among the 
species. However, rapid absorption and moderate oral bioavailability has been found in humans (see section 
2.3.3. ). Exposure to cladribine after oral dosing increased roughly in proportion to the increase in dose. The 
volume of distribution was large and distribution was rapid and wide including the brain.  
Metabolism studies revealed that cladribine is metabolized only to a small extent by phase I and II enzymes 
and neither induction nor marked inhibition of CYP450 enzymes has been found. Furthermore, the available 
data support a low potential for interaction with drug transporters. 
Unchanged cladribine and up to 10 metabolites were identified in plasma, red blood cells, urine and faeces in 
mouse and monkey, with similar metabolic profiles. However, no human mass balance study has been 
performed and there is insufficient understanding of any human specific drug related material in human 
plasma. Consequently, no comparable plasma metabolite exposures data between human and the species 
was available for safety testing. The applicant argued that since the metabolites found in mouse and monkey 
plasma are similar as well as the metabolites found in mouse, monkey and human urine, the metabolic 
pathways proposed for mice and monkey is also relevant for humans. Taking also into consideration the very 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 24/131 
  
  
short exposure of the parent drug (two treatments weeks per year, one month apart), and the rapid 
excretion, the issue was not further pursued. 
Non-clinical toxicology of cladribine was characterized in a set of single dose and repeat dose toxicity, 
genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, reproductive and developmental toxicity, local tolerance and antigenicity 
studies in different species (mouse, rat, rabbit, monkey and guinea pig). Most toxicology studies were 
performed by SC or IV routes, which, based on exposure were also considered relevant. 
The single-dose toxicity studies conducted demonstrate that cladribine is only moderately toxic following 
parenteral administration. The pivotal studies designed to evaluate the repeat-dose toxicity of cladribine were 
conducted in mice and cynomolgus monkeys. The toxic effects observed in mice and monkeys were generally 
dose-dependent and reversible. The primary target organs were the immune system, bone marrow, skin, 
mucous membranes, testes and kidneys. No toxic effects were observed when cladribine was administered by 
oral route up to 20 mg/kg/day in mice and up to 6 mg/kg/days in cynomolgus monkeys, respectively. The 
safety margin to intended clinical human exposure following oral administration in mice and monkeys at 
these NOAEL was 4 times or more (when considering the cumulative exposure). 
As part of its primary pharmacodynamic effects, cladribine causes DNA strand breaks and has DNA repair 
inhibiting effects. Thus, there is a risk for genotoxicity. In the long-term carcinogenicity study with mice, 
cladribine caused increased tumours only in the Harderian glands at an exposure exceeding the expected 
maximum human exposure by 15-fold. These tumours were considered clinically irrelevant as humans do not 
have a comparable anatomical structure. In addition, no tumours were observed in the short-term 
carcinogenicity study in Tg.rasH2 mice at an exposure exceeding the expected maximum human exposure up 
to 25-fold. Hence, no evidence for a relevant carcinogenic risk to humans was revealed in the mouse models. 
However, in the carcinogenicity studies with Tg.rasH2 mice also no cladribine-induced lymphopenia was 
observed.  
In reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in animals, cladribine was shown to be embryolethal and 
to induce fetal malformations. The adverse effects on development occurred at dosage levels lower than 
those causing maternal toxicity. Furthermore, while no effect on female fertility was observed, reduced testes 
weights and increased numbers of non-motile sperm was observed in a study with male mice, although no 
actual detrimental effects on fertility was seen. Testicular changes were also seen in monkeys. The potential 
of cladribine to affect male fertility in humans is unknown. However, based on cladribine genotoxicity, a 
potential risk that cladribine can affect maturing germ cells cannot be excluded. 
Based on these data, use of cladribine is contraindicated in pregnant and lactating women. Due to the 
genotoxic potential of cladribine and possible effects on spermatogonia and stem cells, an adequate timing to 
prevent pregnancies after end of treatment is recommended not only for women being treated with 
cladribine, but also for female partners of male patients. An access margin of 6 months after administration 
of the last cladribine dose was considered acceptable. Further information is provided in a prescribers and 
patient guide including advice for use of effective contraception. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical program was considered acceptable and adequate in order to support the present 
application for use of cladribine in the treatment of adult patients with highly active RMS. The findings from 
non-clinical pharmacology studies were in line with the mechanism of action of cladribine with the main 
target organs being lymphoid and haematopoietic systems. The non-clinical PK studies suggest a low 
Assessment report

potential of cladribine for drug-drug interaction. Toxicology studies showed a genotoxic and a teratogenic 
potential of cladribine. Based on the ERA results, cladribine is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
All clinical pharmacology studies were carried out in subjects with MS or haematological malignancies since it 
was not considered appropriate to conduct these in healthy volunteers in view of the nucleotide-related 
cytotoxicity of cladribine, especially on lymphocytes. 
A total of 10 phase I trials have been conducted to investigate the clinical pharmacology of cladribine (see 
Table 2). Furthermore, population pharmacokinetic (popPK) analyses based on the clinical pharmacology 
studies and a sub-population from the phase III trial CLARITY, as well as PK/PD modelling have been 
performed using pooled data pooled from Phase II and III studies in MS patients. In addition, 19 in vitro 
studies with human biomaterial have been performed. Validated methods have been applied for the analysis 
of cladribine and the metabolite 2-chloroadenine in human plasma or urine. 
The clinical pharmacology program aimed at describing the absorption and disposition of cladribine. 
Furthermore, clinical trials were conducted with the aim to identify factors, which may alter exposure and to 
reveal potential interactions with food and with other medical products. 
Absorption  
Different oral formulations were tested in biopharmaceutical studies. These oral formulations comprised 
HPβCD cladribine tablets, hard gelatin capsule formulations, as well as a mucoadhesive tablet formulation, 
with varying excipients, aimed at further increasing the bioavailability of cladribine and reducing variability. 
As a result of these studies the tablet employing HPβCD with a strength of 10 mg cladribine was selected 
based on its bioavailability and low variability as the clinical trial formulation. 
Cladribine is rapidly absorbed, with a median t max of 0.5h (range 0.5-1.5 h) following a single dose of a 
10 mg HPβCD tablets. Cladribine showed moderate permeability and high solubility. Administration of 10 mg 
cladribine resulted in a cladribine mean cmax in the range of 22 to 29 ng/mL and corresponding mean AUC in 
the range of 80 to 101 ng·h/mL.  
The absolute oral bioavailability in MS subjects is approximately 40%, which is mainly explained by 
incomplete absorption due to transporter-mediated efflux. According to in vitro studies, cladribine is a 
substrate of BCRP (ABCG2) transporter proteins, which is abundantly expressed in the small intestine. 
Cladribine was also shown to be a weak substrate of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), however the significance is likely 
low. Furthermore, it was a substrate of the nucleoside transporters CNTs (Concentrative Nucleoside 
Transporters) and ENTs (Equilibrative Nucleoside Transporters) more specifically ENT1 and CNT3.  
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 28/131 
  
  
In vitro and in vivo data showing lack of appreciable CYP-mediated drug metabolism suggest that any 
contribution of a pre-systemic metabolism/first pass effect to the intermediate bioavailability of cladribine is 
negligible.  
In comparing the tablet formulation intended for commercial use with the clinical trial formulation used in the 
pivotal studies, there were some differences in the composition. No comparative clinical bioavailability / 
bioequivalence study has been conducted comparing these two formulations. Instead, in vitro dissolution 
studies have shown comparable dissolution profiles. Furthermore, in vivo studies with different oral cladribine 
formulations showed that varying sorbitol contents across the range of both the cladribine clinical trials tablet 
formulation and the formulation intended for commercial use did not substantially alter the oral bioavailability 
of cladribine. 
Data from food-interaction studies  
When cladribine was administered together with a high fat meal, the absorption was delayed (t max 1.5h), 
Cmax was lower (by 29%), while the area under the curve (AUC) was minimally affected (AUC0-∞ reduced by 
4%).  
Distribution 
The applicant performed two in vitro studies to assess protein binding and blood/plasma distribution.  
The volume of distribution was found to be large (with a mean of 480–490 L), indicating extensive tissue 
distribution and intracellular uptake. In vitro experiments showed that cladribine and its phosphorylated 
metabolites were retained in lymphocytes isolated from healthy blood donors. The accumulation occurred 
almost completely in the first hour of incubation. Maximum concentrations of cladribine and/or its metabolites 
in lymphocytes at 0.1 µM incubations are about 30 to 40 times greater than in the total cell suspension.  
After entering the target cells, cladribine is phosphorylated to cladribine monophosphate (Cd-AMP ) by DCK 
(and also by deoxyguanosine kinase in the mitochondria). Cd-AMP is further phosphorylated to cladribine 
diphosphate (Cd-ADP) and cladribine triphosphate (Cd-ATP). The dephosphorylation and deactivation of 
Cd-AMP is catalysed by cytoplasmic 5'-NTase. In a study of the intracellular PK of Cd-AMP and Cd-ATP in 
patients with chronic myelogenous leukaemia, the levels of Cd-ATP were approximately half of the Cd-AMP 
levels. Intracellular half-life of Cd-AMP was 15 h. Intracellular half-life of Cd-ATP was 10 h. 
The plasma protein binding of cladribine is low (20%) and independent of plasma concentration. In a small 
study in cancer patients, the CSF/plasma ratio was approximately 0.25 following an IV infusion, indicating 
that cladribine penetrates the blood brain barrier. 
Elimination 
No radioactive labelled human mass balance study was performed due to the long retention of cladribine in 
lymphocytes.  
The metabolic profiles of cladribine were investigated in urine and plasma after IV and oral administration to 
humans. A total of 10 possible metabolites have been identified. These metabolites were formed by the 
following proposed pathways: oxidative cleavage at the adeninedeoxyribose bond, oxidation at the adenine or 
the deoxyribose moiety, and conjugation. Following both oral and IV administration, the parent compound 
cladribine was the main component present in plasma and urine (approximately 60% of a single dose was 
excreted as unchanged cladribine). No major plasma metabolites (i.e. exceeding 10% of the parent drug 
AUC) have been identified. The most notable metabolite, 2-chloroadenine, actually represents a minor 
metabolite in both plasma and urine and accounts for around 3% of parent drug exposure after oral 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 29/131 
  
  
administration. This metabolite is reported as being several fold less cytotoxic in different types of leukocytes 
compared to cladribine (Lindemalm et al., 2004). Low levels of carboxy-cladribine and N-oxide-2-
chloroadenine were also found in plasma. Additional metabolites detected at low levels in urine were carboxy-
cladribine after oral and IV administration, and N-oxide-cladribine and N-oxide-2-chloroadenine after oral 
administration. 
These metabolic characteristics are further supported by in vitro studies investigating potential CYP450 
enzymes in pooled human liver microsomes and in human hepatic S9 fractions, which showed limited 
metabolism with 92-100% of cladribine remaining as unchanged cladribine. However, based on in vitro cDNA 
expressed enzyme systems cladribine could be metabolised by CYP1A1, CYP1A2 and CYP2D6.  
Based on the popPK analysis, total mean clearance (CL) and typical t 1/2 in patients with MS was determined 
to be 45.8 L/h and 23h, respectively. The median values for elimination were 22.2 L/h for renal clearance and 
23.4 L/h for non-renal clearance. The renal clearance of cladribine exceeds the glomerular filtration rate, 
indicating active renal tubular secretion of cladribine. The non-renal elimination consists predominantly of 
intracellular metabolism and elimination of cladribine and phosphorylated forms of cladribine. Hepatic 
metabolism plays only a minor role (i.e. <10% of the total cladribine CL). There was no excretion data from 
faeces. 
From the population PK analysis, variability in cladribine pharmacokinetics parameters appears to be 
relatively small. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
After oral administration of cladribine across a dose range from 3 to 20 mg, Cmax and AUC increased in a 
dose-proportional fashion. No time dependence of cladribine exposure has been observed after multiple 
dosing. No significant accumulation of cladribine concentration in plasma has been observed after repeated 
dosing. 
Special populations 
No dedicated clinical pharmacology study has been performed to investigate potential PK differences for 
males or females. A trend towards a higher cladribine exposure in female subjects has however been 
observed in the popPK and PK/PD models. No specific study or population PK analysis comparing cladribine 
PK in different ethnic groups has been provided. This was accepted as no clinically relevant influence of ethnic 
differences on oral cladribine PK is expected. 
Clinical studies of cladribine did not include elderly subjects above 65 years. Therefore, it cannot be 
determined whether patients > 65 years may have different PK of cladribine than younger subjects. Likewise, 
no studies were conducted in the paediatric population. This is in line with the PIP waiver from birth to less 
than 18 years of age based on the ground that MAVENCLAD is likely to be unsafe in the paediatric population. 
The popPK model analysis did not show any effect of age (range 18 to 65 years) or gender on cladribine PK. 
Impaired renal and hepatic function 
No dedicated studies have been performed in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Given that cladribine 
is not excreted via the faeces and in light of its metabolism characteristics, hepatic impairment was not 
expected to have any substantial impact on the elimination of cladribine rendering any further study 
unnecessary.

Overall, approximately 30 patients in the clinical pharmacology program had a calculated creatinine clearance 
(Cockgroft-Gault, CLcr) < 90 mL/min and would be categorized as having mild renal impairment. The number 
of patients with moderate renal impairment was very low. 
In the population PK analysis in subjects with MS approximately half of the elimination of cladribine is related 
to renal elimination (CLR: 23.1 L/h, CLNR: 22.7 L/h).  Of the 173 patients included in the analysis, 151 had 
normal renal function, 21 patients had mild renal impairment, and 1 patient had moderate renal impairment. 
The median (range) CLcr was 107.9 (49.6 -244.4) mL/min. According to the popPK model, the predicted total 
clearance is 45.8 L/h at a CLcr of 90 mL/min and 37.4 L/h at a CLcr of 60 mL/min. This corresponds to a 
22% increase in exposure. The predicted decrease in total clearance for a typical patient with typical 
creatinine clearance representing the different degrees of renal function was predicted to 18% in mild 
impairment (CLcr= 65 ml/min), 30% in moderate renal impairment (CLcr = 40 ml/min), and 40% in severe 
renal impairment (CLcr = 20ml/min). 
PK interaction studies 
The potential for cladribine to inhibit CYP1A2, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1 and 3A4 was investigated in 
vitro in pooled human liver microsomes. There was no signal of CYP inhibition up to 5 µM (covering systemic 
inhibition potential), however too low cladribine concentration compared to the intestinal cut-off 
concentration was used for CYP3A4. A new in vitro study was conducted with acceptable study set up 
including appropriate incubation concentration to cover intestine concentration. The study confirmed that the 
risk of clinically relevant inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 is very low. 
The results from investigation whether cladribine is an inducer of CYP2B6 and CYP3A were inconclusive. An 
induction of CYP1A2 based on mRNA increases was a borderline in vitro finding. The clinical experience using 
cladribine within oncology is vast and no report of CYP induction is known.  
Cladribine was not an in vitro inhibitor of OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OAT4, MRP2, MRP4 and OAT1. 
However, it appears to be an inhibitor in vitro of BCRP, MRP5 and OAT3. Based on the estimated systemic 
and intestinal cut-offs the risk of clinically relevant interaction was however limited. 
Two clinical drug-drug-interaction studies were performed. 
The interaction between cladribine and IFN-β1a was studied in 15 patients with MS. This was a three-period 
open-label multiple dose study. The subjects received cladribine orally at 10 to 20 mg/day for five 
consecutive days (Days 1 to 5). After at least 2 days following the last dose of cladribine, subjects received 
IFN-β1a at different doses. The study suggests that co-administration of cladribine with IFN-β-1a has a small 
effect on cladribine clearance. However, the 11% increase in total clearance was not considered to be 
clinically relevant. 
The other study was an open label single-dose cross-over study in 18 MS patients. In one period, 10 mg 
cladribine was administered alone. In the other period, subjects received a dose of 40 mg pantoprazole on 
Days 1 and 2 and a single dose of cladribine on Day 2, 3 h after having received pantoprazole. The study 
showed that repeated oral pantoprazole 40 mg single doses administered 15h and 3h prior to administration 
of cladribine had no influence on the PK profile of cladribine. Therefore, a change in gastric pH induced by the 
concomitant administration of a proton pump inhibitor does not affect the rate and extent of cladribine 
absorption. 
Finally, the potential for complex formation between free cyclodextrin (HPßCD), released from the cladribine 
tablet formulation, and concomitant drugs (ibuprofen, furosemide, gabapentin) was investigated in vitro.

Complexation of these drugs with HPßCD was seen, however, no firm conclusions could be drawn from the 
study results.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Cladribine is a synthetic analogue of the nucleoside deoxyadenosine. It differs from deoxyadenosine only by 
the substitution of a chlorine for hydrogen in the 2-position of the purine ring. The chlorine substitution in the 
purine ring protects cladribine from degradation by adenosine deaminase, increasing the intracellular 
residence time (Beutler 1992, Sipe 2005). Cladribine is a product and activation requires intracellular 
phosphorylation to its active triphosphate form 2-CdATP. This is particularly efficiently achieved in 
lymphocytes, due to their constitutively high deoxycytidine kinase (DCK) and relatively low 5’-nucleotidase 
levels. A high DCK to 5’-nucleotidase ratio favours accumulation of 2-CdATP, making lymphocytes particularly 
susceptible to the effects of compound and differences in in expression levels of DCK and 5’-nucleotidase 
between immune cell subtypes may explain differences in immune cell sensitivity to cladribine (Salvat 2009; 
Leist and Weissert 2011).  
The molecular mechanism of action of 2-CdATP was studied in dividing and non-dividing lymphocytes and 
leukaemia cells including direct and indirect actions on DNA and pro-apoptotic effects on mitochondria 
(Freyer et al, 2015). In dividing cells, 2-CdATP can interfere with DNA synthesis via inhibition of 
ribonucleotide reductase and competes with deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP) for incorporation into DNA 
by DNA polymerases. In resting immune cells, cladribine causes DNA single-strand breaks, rapid nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide (NAD) consumption, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) depletion and cell death (Carson et 
al, 1983; Seto et al, 1985; Seto et al, 1986). In addition, cladribine can cause direct caspase dependent and 
independent apoptosis via the release of cytochrome C and apoptosis-inducing factor into the cytosol of non-
dividing cells (Leoni et al, 1998; Genini et al, 2000). 
MS involves a complex chain of events with a contribution from different immune cell types, with autoreactive 
T and B cells being the key players in the pathophysiological disease processes (Sipe 2010, Hemmer 2015). 
The mechanisms by which cladribine exerts its therapeutic effects in MS is not fully elucidated but its 
preferential effect on lymphocytes could potentially interrupt the cascade of immune events central to MS.  
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
No dedicated primary pharmacology studies have been performed in support of this application. However, the 
PD effects of parenteral cladribine have previously been extensively investigated in the setting of lymphoid 
malignancies. Furthermore, clinical studies performed with parenteral cladribine in MS have been performed 
and showed a preferential and sustained reduction in lymphocytes, with only minor effects on neutrophils, 
platelets, hemoglobin and hematocrit levels (Beutler et al., 1996; Romine et al., 1999; Rice et al., 2000). 
These effects of oral cladribine on haematologic parameters and in particular lymphocytes were also assessed 
in the phase III oral cladribine studies CLARITY, CLARITY EXTENSION and ORACLE MS. Furthermore, a 
popPK/PD model was developed in order to describe the time course of absolute lymphocyte count (ALC). 
Finally, a time-to-event population model was developed to support the choice of dose and the re-treatment 
criteria including a delay in case of insufficient recovery of lymphocyte counts. 
Cladribine has been shown to cause selective depletion of T and B cells, with a greater effect on CD4+ and 
CD8+ cells, with comparably low activity against other haematologic and immune cell types (Beutler et al., 
1996; Rice et al.,2000; Grieb et al., 2001). CD8+ T cells have a less pronounced decrease and a faster 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 32/131 
  
  
recovery, resulting in a decreased CD4:CD8 ratio. CD19+ B cells and CD14+/CD56+ natural killer cells are 
also affected but more transiently reduced than T cells. Changes in neutrophils, eosinophils, erythrocytes and 
platelets are relatively low and minimal (Sipe 2010, Leist and Weissert 2011). 
In terms of lymphocyte depletion dynamics, treatment with oral cladribine in CLARITY resulted in a dose 
dependent decrease of lymphocyte counts when compared to baseline levels, followed by a gradual increase. 
At first nadir (Week 16) following start of treatment in year 1 and second nadir (Week 55) following start of 
treatment in year 2, the median lymphocyte counts decreased by 42% and 58%, respectively, from baseline 
pre-treatment levels. Similar results were obtained in the ORACLE study and in the group of subjects of the 
CLARITY EXT study who received cladribine treatment for the first time after receiving placebo in CLARITY. 
Exploratory lymphocyte subset analyses in patient subgroups helped to better understand the effect of 
cladribine on absolute numbers of naïve and central memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, CD19+ B cells and 
CD16+/CD56+ natural killer cells. Treatment with oral cladribine 3.5 mg/kg resulted in a moderate, 
sustained decline in absolute numbers of circulating T-cell counts (as assessed by CD3, CD4, and CD8 
markers). In CLARITY, the median reduction seen at first and second nadir for the CD4+ subset was -56% 
and -72% respectively and, thus, higher than the reduction for the CD8+ subset at first nadir (-31%) and 
second nadir (-39%), consequently decreasing the CD4/CD8 ratio (see also laboratory findings in section 2.6. 
).  Similarly, absolute numbers of median CD4+ T cell counts were more affected than CD8+ cell counts in 
CLARITY EXT (subjects who received cladribine treatment for the first time after receiving placebo in 
CLARITY) and ORACLE trials, and also took longer to recover, again leading to a decrease in CD4/CD8 ratio. 
In summary, the absolute median numbers of CD4+ lymphocytes are decreased more than CD8+ cell counts, 
and the recovery of the latter is faster. Treatment with cladribine is therefore associated with a temporarily 
decreased CD4/CD8 ratio. 
To evaluate the dose- (exposure)-response relationship with respect to ALC following administration of 
cladribine, a popPK/PD model was developed. Data from CLARITY, CLARITY EXT and ORACLE MS were 
included in the analysis. The analysis dataset included 47,959 ALC observations from 1931 subjects. Hereof, 
508 observations were missing and a further 203 observations were ignored as some subjects had multiple 
recorded ALC observations at time 0. Accordingly, the total number of ALC measurements included in the 
analysis summed to 47,248. The analyses were performed using the non-linear mixed effects modelling 
approach. The final model described the ALC dynamics observed following cladribine administration by use of 
an indirect response model with cladribine stimulating the loss of ALC through an inhibitory maximum 
exposure (Emax) drug-effect relationship. According to the model, the time course of ALC response was 
characterized by a slow turnover of cells corresponding to a mean residence time of lymphocytes 2.4 years. 
Women were estimated to have a 17% lower nadir value compared to men due to a higher sensitivity to 
cladribine exposure. The inter-individual variability in C50 parameter was approximately 65%. This indicates 
that the individual response to a certain cladribine exposure level is highly variable. Concomitant 
administration of IFN-β-1a was associated with an additional 19% drop in ALC compared to cladribine alone, 
whilst concomitant glucocorticoids had no influence on ALC response to cladribine. 
Based on the long lasting PD properties of cladribine, the proposed posology consists of 2 treatment courses, 
each comprising 2 treatment weeks. To support the choice of dose to be used in clinical practice, the 
applicant developed a repeated time-to-event population model, initially using data from CLARITY and later 
extended to also include data from CLARITY EXT and ORACLE MS. The analysis dataset included a total of 
1542 subjects (1319 from CLARITY, 867 from CLARITY EXT and 223 from ORACLE MS [fulfilling McDonald 
2010 criteria]) and 753 relapse observations. The model described the time to occurrence and re-occurrence 
of qualifying relapses using a Weibull distribution with a decreasing hazard over time. The effect of cladribine 
was implemented on the hazard function using an Emax drug-effect relationship, whereby the effect is driven 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 33/131 
  
  
by a (decaying) effect compartment exposure related to the cumulative amount of cladribine administered 
adjusted for individual creatinine clearance. The number of relapses in the year prior to receiving cladribine 
treatment was included in the covariate model as a proportional increase of the scale parameter of the 
Weibull distribution. The model showed that a dose of 3.5 mg/kg over 2 years is appropriate in reducing the 
risk of relapses: increasing the dose above 3.5 mg/kg did not rapidly and substantially increase the effect on 
the underlying hazard, whilst decreasing it to lower doses moves the exposure to the steeper part of the 
curve, and quickly leads to a marked drop in efficacy. The relation between the hazard and the effect 
compartment exposure was derived at different times (Month 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, and 24) following the 
first dose for the typical subject. The predicted relationships during the first 2 years of treatment  with 
3.5mg/kg  cumulative  dose  showed that the  hazard  of  having  a  relapse  decreases  with  time  for  any  drug 
exposure,  and  decreases with  the  drug  exposure  at  any  time.   
Simulations  based  on  the relapse  rate  model jointly  with  the  ALC  model,  have  been  applied  to 
investigate  the  effect  of  treatment postponement in the second year (re-treatment criteria), allowing more 
time for the ALC to recover for those subjects who have not done so by the end of the first year. These 
simulations have shown that i) only very few subjects (1% or less) would not recover to Grade 1 or 0 within 
an additional 6 months before re-treatment in year 2, ii) in those  subjects  qualifying  for  postponement,  the 
proportion  reaching  Grade  3-4  lymphopenia  at some time in the study is decreased (from 23% to 15%) 
when the mitigation rule is applied, and iii)  such  a  delay  of  up  to  6 months  has  essentially  no  effect  on 
the  probability  of  experiencing relapses  during  the  second  year  of  cladribine  treatment.  In particular, the 
percentages of subjects not experiencing a certain (1 to 6) number of relapses, as well as the mean predicted 
relapse-free survival and its probability distribution over time, were comparable across the different scenarios 
considered during the analysis. This  means  that  if  drug  administration needs to be interrupted for 
lymphopenia, the effect on efficacy is sustained. 
With regards to secondary pharmacology, the effect of cladribine on QTc has been subject to detailed 
analyses based on a subpopulation of 143 patients from the CLARITY trial. This ECG sub-study in the target 
population of MS patients was designed to evaluate potential acute and/or cumulative effects of cladribine on 
the ECG time-intervals (RR, PR, QRS, QT, QTcB and QTcF) and T-wave morphology, with a particular 
emphasis on the heart rate corrected QT interval (QTcF primary, QTcB supportive), as a well-accepted 
surrogate measure signifying delay or heterogeneity in cardiac ventricular repolarization, which may be 
possibly associated with proarrhythmic product characteristics. QTcF was considered the primary outcome 
variable. According to the results, cladribine does not appear to influence the QTc interval to a clinically 
relevant extent. 
2.4.1.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Cladribine’s mechanism of action is based on 2 possible actions of the intracellularly formed metabolite 
CdATP, affecting both dividing and quiescent lymphocytes. It exerts reversible and long lasting selective 
depletion of lymphocytes, which are thought to underlie the autoimmune processes involved in MS 
pathophysiology. As a result, the design and conduct of a classical clinical pharmacology developmental 
program in healthy adult subjects was not feasible. Therefore, all clinical pharmacology and 
biopharmaceutical studies were designed and conducted in patients in the targeted indications of MS or 
haematological malignancies. For this very reason, it was acknowledged that not all typical elements of 
clinical pharmacology programs for non-cytotoxic new molecular entities could be conducted.

Results from PK studies show that the absolute bioavailability of oral tablets of HPβCD cladribine is 
approximately 40% and is mainly determined by the absorption process. The variability in exposure was 
acceptable. Following oral administration of tablets absorption was rapid, with a time to maximum 
concentration in the range of 0.5-1.5 hours. Intake of cladribine tablets with food resulted in a small delay of 
the absorption (t max 1.5h), and a small reduction in exposure requiring no dose adjustments. 
Furthermore, the exposure of cladribine was shown to be dose dependent over the investigated dose range. 
The volume of distribution is large and complex with specific accumulation of the phosphorylated forms of 
cladribine in lymphocytes. Plasma/serum protein binding of cladribine is overall low and concentration 
independent.  
The elimination of cladribine is equally dependent on renal (60% of dose excreted as parent compound) and 
non-renal routes, where the non-renal elimination consists predominantly of intracellular metabolism, non-
hepatic extra-cellular metabolism and only to a minor extent hepatic metabolism. The majority of the non-
renal elimination is likely related to the rapid uptake in lymphocytes and further forming phosphates. 
Cladribine has three chiral centres. Adenosine as well as 2-deoxy-D-ribose are natural compounds and their 
stereochemistry is well understood. With the introduction of the chlorine in the 2-position of the adenine 
moiety, the stereochemistry of the molecule is unlikely to be affected, while it renders the molecule more 
stable against metabolism by adenosine deaminase. Although this has not been studied, it appears plausible 
that cladribine does not have different properties from analogues like adenosine, which has well-known 
stereochemistry. 
Due to the lack of a human mass balance, there is insufficient understanding of the existence of any human 
specific circulating drug-related material in human plasma or any major circulating metabolite. Overall, this 
gap was addressed by the available in vitro data and identification of metabolites in human plasma, which 
showed that cladribine is not metabolised to a meaningful extent. 
While the turnover of cladribine in microsomes was low, the available data suggest some role of CYP1A1, 
CYP1A2 and CYP2D6 in the metabolism of cladribine. Overall, the importance of CYP enzymes in the 
elimination of cladribine was considered to be likely low. Renal clearance of cladribine exceeds the glomerular 
filtration rate, indicating the drug undergoes net tubular secretion in addition to glomerular filtration. This 
was consistently observed throughout the clinical pharmacology program. While no dedicated studies in 
patients with renal impairment have been conducted, there was some evidence for a dependence of total 
cladribine clearance on creatinine clearance based on popPK analyses. A modest reduction in total clearance 
for subjects with mild renal impairment is predicted. Cladribine is not recommended in patients with 
moderate or severe renal impairment. There is no experience in patients with hepatic impairment, which was 
considered acceptable given that cladribine is not excreted via the faeces and in light of its metabolism 
characteristics. 
No in vitro evidence for either inhibition or induction of CYP450 enzymes has been observed. This is 
confirmed by the drug-drug interaction studies with IFN-β-1a and pantoprazole showing that concomitant 
administration of these drugs does not lead to relevant PK interactions. At the level of cladribine absorption, 
the only conceivable interaction pathway of clinical relevance appears to be breast cancer resistance protein 
(BCRP or ABCG2). A possible decrease in cladribine exposure could thus occur if potent BCRP transporter 
inducers are co-administered. In vitro studies also indicate that cladribine is a substrate of the ENT1 and 
CNT3 transport proteins. Although the net contribution to cladribine exposure is not known, it could 
theoretically be altered by potent ENT1 and CNT3 transporter inhibitors. This information is reflected in SmPC 
section 4.5. Furthermore, the CHMP noted that the effect of cladribine on hormonal contraceptives is 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 35/131 
  
  
currently unknown. The CHMP therefore recommended that the applicant performed a drug-drug interaction 
study after approval. 
Complexation of other medicinal products with HPßCD was seen, however, no firm conclusions could be 
drawn from the study results. Besides, in the absence of in vivo interaction studies, clinically relevant drug 
interaction scenarios cannot be excluded. As a precautionary measure, administration of any other oral 
medicinal product should be separated from cladribine by at least 3hours. 
There is no clear evidence of gender-related differences in the PK of cladribine. Both the PK and PK/PD model 
suggest a small impact of age and/or weight on exposure and response. It is worth considering the observed 
gender difference as an effect of differing size/body composition of men and women leading to higher 
exposure in women. In the pop PK/PD model, ALC nadir was approximately 17% lower in women compared 
to men. This finding was in less than 50% explained by the higher exposure in women resulting from lower 
body weight and lower renal clearance. The difference in ALC nadir is therefore likely to reflect a higher 
sensitivity in women in terms of pharmacodynamic response to treatment. Overall, the level of evidence was 
limited and the effect was small. No dose-adjustment was considered necessary. 
Modelling and simulation outcomes also showed that ALC decreases as a function of cladribine exposure. 
Simulations furthermore suggested that cumulative cladribine doses lower than 3.5 mg/kg would result in 
lower efficacy outcomes and would not substantially reduce the risk of adverse events. Simulations based on 
the relapse rate model jointly with the ALC model furthermore showed that a delay of re-treatment in year 2 
of 6 months had no adverse effect on efficacy, while the majority of patients were likely to recover from 
severe lymphopenia during such period resulting in a reduced risk for future severe lymphopenia. These data 
thus supported the re-treatment guidelines.  
With regards to secondary pharmacology, the effect of cladribine on QTc has been studied based on a 
subpopulation of 143 patients from the CLARITY trial. According to the results, cladribine does not appear to 
influence the QTc interval to a clinically relevant extent. The design of the ECG study was not in accordance 
with the ICH E4 guideline, especially with respect to timing of ECG and the construction with serial ECG 
assessments following long-time on-treatment. These issues were however not considered to preclude a 
conclusion of an absence of a risk taking also into account the lack of signal from the integrated safety 
analysis and non-clinical studies. 
2.4.2.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the clinical pharmacology data were considered adequate to support the present application.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
To evaluate the clinical efficacy of cladribine, four clinical trials were conducted, including the pivotal 
Phase III trial and its 2-year extension study CLARITY and CLARITY-EXT in adult patients with RRMS.  
A summary of the study design, methods and main results is provided in this section. 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
No specific dose response studies in the target population have been conducted.  
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 36/131 
  
  
The choice of dose in the pivotal CLARITY trial was mainly based on the data from the initial Scripps studies, 
which investigated the use of a parenteral formulation of cladribine in the treatment of MS, in particular 
taking into account the risk of lymphopenia and herpes zoster infections. Safety data of the pooled Scripps 
studies Scripps-C, MS-Scripps, and MS-001 suggested that the risk of herpes zoster infections was dose-
related, increasing in frequency among cladribine-treated subjects who received parenteral doses of 2.8 
mg/kg or higher compared with subjects who received placebo or lower. Therefore, the doses selected to be 
carried forward in future studies were 2.1 mg/kg total cumulative dose and 1.4 mg/kg total cumulative dose, 
the lowest dose that had shown sustained beneficial MRI outcomes. 
Given that the absolute bioavailability achieved with oral dosage forms was approximately 40%, as 
demonstrated for the 10 mg cladribine HPβCD tablet (see section 2.4. ), the estimated corresponding oral 
dose to the parenteral cumulative dose of 2.1 mg/kg/year was 5.25 mg/kg and the oral equivalent to a 
parenteral cumulative dose of 1.4 mg/kg/year was 3.5 mg/kg. 
(Re-)treatment regimens, either two or four courses in the first year with repeat dosing of two courses in the 
second year, were also based on previous parenteral studies and were chosen to optimize the benefit-risk 
profile for the oral formulation of cladribine. 
A brief summary of the Scripps studies is provided below. 
Scripps-B (2-CdA-MS-SCRIPB) Cladribine (2-CdA) Treatment of Multiple Sclerosis: A Multicenter 
Trial 
This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled phase II study to 
evaluate safety and efficacy of immunosuppression with cladribine in subjects with chronic progressive 
multiple sclerosis. Subjects were randomized to one of these treatment groups: 2.1 mg/kg cladribine (total 
dose), 0.7 mg/kg cladribine (total dose), or placebo. A total of 11 subjects were enrolled in the study; 4 
received cladribine 0.7 mg/kg, 4 received cladribine 2.1 mg/kg and 3 received placebo.  
Cladribine was administered at 0.07 mg/kg/day by SC injection for 5 consecutive days per course every 28 
days. In the cladribine 2.1 mg/kg group, a maximum of 6 courses were to be active drug and 2 courses were 
placebo. In the cladribine 0.7 mg/kg group, a maximum of 2 courses were to be active drug and the 
remaining 6 courses were placebo. 
After completing the double-blind phase, subjects who had been treated with placebo or cladribine 0.7 mg/kg 
were eligible to receive 3 monthly courses of cladribine (0.14 mg/kg/day for 5 days every 28 days) for a total 
retreatment dose of 2.1 mg/kg. Subjects who were initially treated with cladribine 2.1 mg/kg received 
4 courses of placebo.  All 11 subjects entered the crossover re-treatment phase. 
Treatment with cladribine induced lymphopenia, which reached Grade 3-4 levels in all the subjects receiving 
the higher dose of cladribine. Infections, particularly urinary tract infections, were also commonly observed. 
No statistical analysis was performed on the efficacy data. 
Scripps-C (2CdA-MS-SCRIPC) Cladribine (2CdA) Treatment of Relapsing-Remitting Multiple 
Sclerosis 
This was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II study designed to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of cladribine in subjects with RRMS. This study utilized retrospective data collection 
and analysis. Subjects with RRMS were randomized to 1 of 2 treatment groups: Cladribine 2.1 mg/kg or 
placebo. Subjects in the cladribine group received 6 courses of cladribine, given as 5 consecutive daily SC 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 37/131 
  
  
injections at a dose of 0.07 mg/kg/day, every 28 days. The 6 courses were followed by 2 courses of placebo. 
Subjects in the placebo group were to receive 8 courses of placebo.  
The total duration of the double-blind phase of the study was 18 months, including an 8 month treatment 
period and a 10 month follow-up period.  
A total of 52 subjects were enrolled and randomized to receive study treatment. Of the 52 enrolled subjects, 
49 subjects (26 in the cladribine group and 23 in the placebo group) were included in the analysis population. 
Treatment with 2.1 mg/kg cladribine SC was superior to treatment with placebo in most of the trial efficacy 
endpoints: the annualized clinical relapse rate (ARR, cladribine 0.699, placebo 1.22; p=0.0125) , the 
proportion of subjects who were relapse free at Month 18 (cladribine 10/26, placebo 3/23; p=0.0223), the 
median number of active T1 Gd+ lesions at Month 18 per subject (cladribine 0.0, placebo 1.0; p=0.0004), 
and the median change from baseline in T2 lesion volumes at Month 18 (cladribine -0.12, placebo 1.42; 
p=0.0119). No statistically significant difference was observed for total relapse count between groups.  
As expected, more subjects in the cladribine group experienced Grade 3 or Grade 4 lymphopenia and more 
cladribine-treated subjects reported an infection as an adverse event. 
Notably, according to an independent third party audit at the study site, several major GCP violations and 
irregularities were revealed, based on which the US Food and Drug Administration concluded that the data 
generated from this site were not reliable to support a New Drug Application. 
MS-Scripps (2-CdA-MS-SCRIPP): Cladribine Clinical Trial in the Treatment of Chronic Progressive 
Multiple Sclerosis  
This was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group Phase IIb study 
designed to evaluate safety and efficacy of cladribine 2.8 mg/kg compared with placebo in subjects with 
CPMS. This study utilized retrospective data collection and analysis. The trial included 3 phases: screening, 
double-blind, and follow-up. Subjects who qualified for the study were matched in pairs according to age, 
sex, and severity of disease. The subjects in each pair were randomly assigned to different treatment groups 
for the 2-year double-blind interval.  
During Months 1 through 4 of Year 1, each subject received 4 monthly 7-day infusions of cladribine 
0.1 mg/kg per day or placebo, followed by an 8-month observation interval. Cladribine-treated subjects 
received a total dosage of 2.8 mg/kg. In the second year of the study, subjects initially randomized to 
placebo received a total dosage of cladribine 1.4 mg/kg for 4 months. Subjects who initially received 
cladribine in Year 1 received placebo during these 4 months of Year 2. Subjects were then observed for 
7 months with no treatment. 
The analysis included 49 subjects: 24 patients receiving placebo, then cladribine 1.4 mg/kg, and 25 patients 
receiving cladribine 2.8 mg/kg, then placebo. The results of the efficacy analyses of Year 1 data showed that 
cladribine 2.8 mg/kg was superior to placebo as indicated by the lower volume of T1 enhanced lesions 
(cladribine 1.25, placebo 200; p<0.001) and a lesser increase from baseline in MRI T2 lesion volume 
(cladribine -0.44, placebo 2.3; p=0.003). There was also a lower cumulative progression rate with cladribine 
measured as the change in EDSS score (cladribine 0.0, placebo 0.5; p=0.006) and Scripps Neurologic Rating 
Scale (SNRS) scores (cladribine 4.0, placebo -5.0; p<0.001). 
Adverse events reported for cladribine during this study, and changes in laboratory test results, were 
generally in line with the expected pharmacologic effects of cladribine on lymphocytes. The severity and 
persistence of most cladribine adverse effects appeared to be dose-related, with the exception of the degree

of decrease in lymphocyte count, which was similar following treatment with cladribine 1.4 mg/kg and 
2.8 mg/kg. 
MS-001 (2-CdA-MS-001): Cladribine Clinical Trial in Chronic Non-Remitting Progressive Multiple 
Sclerosis 
The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cladribine in subjects with CPMS and to 
evaluate the dose-response relationship. This was a randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-
controlled, multicenter study designed to compare cladribine 0.7 mg/kg and 2.1 mg/kg with placebo. 
Subjects received either a maximum of 2 weekly courses of cladribine 0.07 mg/kg per day (each treatment 
week consisting of 5 consecutive days) at 4 week intervals (plus 6 courses of placebo: total dose 0.7 mg/kg), 
or a maximum of 6 weekly courses of cladribine 0.07 mg/kg per day (each treatment week consisting of 5 
consecutive days) at 4 week intervals (plus 2 courses of placebo: total dose, 2.1 mg/kg), or 8 weekly courses 
of placebo. 
There were 54 subjects in the placebo group, 53 in the 0.7 mg/kg cladribine group, and 52 in the 2.1 mg/kg 
cladribine group. Both cladribine 0.7 mg/kg and 2.1 mg/kg treatments were superior to placebo treatment in 
subjects with CPMS with respect to the proportion of subjects having detectable MRI T1 enhanced lesions 
(0.7 mg/kg cladribine: 10% [5/53], 2.1 mg/kg cladribine: 6% [3/52], and placebo 31% [17/54], p=0.0080 
and p=0.0009, respectively). A significant difference in favour of both cladribine groups compared to placebo 
was also observed for the mean volume and number of such lesions.  
With regards to safety, a reduction in lymphocyte counts was observed, which was long-lasting and dose-
related. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
One main pivotal trial along with its 2-year extension study has been conducted to support the claimed 
indication. 
2.5.2.1.  CLARITY 
Study 25643 (CLARITY): A phase III, randomized, double-blind, three-arm, placebo-controlled, 
multi-center study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral cladribine in subjects with relapsing-
remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) 
This  was  a  96  week,  Phase  III,  randomized,  double-blind,  3-arm,  placebo-controlled,  multicentre  study  to 
evaluate  the  safety  and  efficacy  of  2  doses  of  oral  cladribine  (3.5 mg/kg  and  5.25  mg/kg)  in  subjects  with 
RRMS. The trial included a pre-trial evaluation period (up to 28 days prior to the start of treatment); an initial 
treatment period during Week 0-48; and a retreatment period during Week 48-96. 
The overall trial design is displayed in Figure 1.

Treatments 
Enrolled subjects were equally randomized into 3 groups to receive: 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 40/131 
  
  
 
 
 
 
•  Cladribine tablets 3.5 mg/kg (administered per os [p.o.] as 0.875 mg/kg/course for two courses plus 
placebo p.o. for two courses during the first 48 weeks and 0.875 mg/kg/course for two courses 
during the second 48 weeks), or 
•  Cladribine tablets 5.25 mg/kg (administered p.o. as 0.875 mg/kg/course for four courses during the 
first 48 weeks and 0.875 mg/kg/course for two courses during the second 48 weeks), or 
•  Matching placebo (administered p.o. for four courses during the first 48 weeks and two courses 
during the second 48 weeks). 
A course was defined as daily administration given consecutively over four to five days. Initial treatment 
during Week 0-48 was administered in two or four separate courses starting at Trial Day 1, Week 5, Week 9 
and Week 13. Retreatment during the Week 48-96 period was administered in two separate courses starting 
at Weeks 48 and 52. During the Week 48-96 period, those patients who received cladribine during Week 0-
48 (both cladribine 3.5 mg/kg and cladribine 5.25 mg/kg) continued to receive cladribine 3.5 mg/kg, and 
those patients who received placebo during Week 0-48 continued to receive placebo.  
Figure 2 displays the dosing courses for the three treatment groups. Study medication was administrated 
after an overnight fast on an empty stomach, and once administered, the patients were to wait at least one 
hour before eating. 
Figure 2 Treatment Dosing Diagram 
Permitted Medicines 
Corticosteroids were permitted for the treatment of acute relapses at the discretion of the Treating Physician. 
Steroid  treatments  for  relapses  were  to  consist  of  1g  i.v.  solumedrol  for  three  days.  If  not  possible,  oral 
steroids  could  be  utilised  for  no  more  than  fourteen  days  following  a  relapse.  Any  MRI  scans  conducted 
during  the trial  were  to  be  performed before  administration of  steroids  or  at  least  seven  days  after the last 
dose of steroids. 
Prohibited Medicines 
Prohibited  medicines  included  immunomodulatory  therapy,  immunosuppressive  therapy,  cytokine  or  anti-
cytokine therapy and medication suspected to interact with cladribine.  
Rescue Medication 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 41/131 
  
  
 
 
 
Beginning at Week 24, rescue medication became an option and patients who experienced greater than one 
qualifying relapse (see definition below) and/or a sustained increase in EDSS of ≥1, or ≥1.5 points if baseline 
EDSS  was  0  (over  a  period  of  at  least  three  months)  during  a  calendar  year  qualified  to  receive  rescue 
medication. Rebif® was the preferred rescue medication in the trial but the Investigator and patient may have 
elected  to  take  another  disease  modifying  drug.  Any  patient  who  accepted  rescue  medication  was 
permanently discontinued from trial medication and was to remain in the trial and perform all the scheduled 
assessments according to the visit schedule.  
Objectives 
Primary objective 
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of cladribine versus placebo in the reduction of qualifying 
relapse rate during 96 weeks of treatment in patients with RRMS. 
Secondary objectives 
The  secondary  objectives  were  to  assess  the  effect  of  cladribine  in  patients  with  RRMS  on  progression  of 
disability, and in reducing lesion activity as measured by MRI.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint was the qualifying relapse rate at 96 weeks. A qualifying relapse was defined as a two-
grade increase in one or more Kurtzke Functional Systems (KFS) or a one-grade increase in two or more KFS, 
excluding  changes  in  bowel/bladder  or  cognition,  in  the  absence  of  fever,  lasting  for  ≥24  hours,  and 
preceded by at least 30 days of clinical stability or improvement 
Secondary endpoints: 
• 
Proportion of patients qualifying relapse-free at 96 weeks 
•  Disability progression at 96 weeks (time to sustained change in EDSS ≥1 point, or ≥1.5 points if 
baseline EDSS was 0, over a period of at least 3 months) 
•  Mean number of active T1 gadolinium-enhanced lesions per patient per scan at 96 Weeks 
•  Mean number of active T2 lesions per patient per scan at 96 weeks 
•  Mean number of combined unique (CU) lesions defined as 1) new T1 gadolinium-enhancing, or 2) 
new T2 non-enhancing or enlarging lesions, or 3) both, without double-counting (designated “CU 
lesions”) per patient per scan at 96 weeks 
Tertiary endpoints 
Tertiary  endpoints  included,  amongst  other,  time  to  first  qualifying  relapse  at  96  weeks,  proportion  of 
subjects rescued at 96 weeks and the assessment of patient health related quality of life (HRQL) and health 
care resource utilisation (HRU).  
Sample size 
It was determined that a sample size of 1290 subjects (430 subjects in each group) provided 90% power to 
detect a clinically meaningful 25% relative reduction in the primary efficacy endpoint, when comparing each 
of the two cladribine dose groups to the placebo group. The calculation was performed using a two-sided t-
test with the following assumptions: the calculation assumed 2.1 for the mean number of qualifying relapses 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 42/131 
  
  
 
during 96 weeks in the placebo group, and a relative 25% reduction in mean number of qualifying relapses 
(i.e., the mean number of qualifying relapses during 96 weeks was 1.575 in the cladribine group). Other 
assumptions were a common standard deviation of 2.02 (estimated from PRISMS-2 year data in the placebo 
group) for the number of qualifying relapses, a 10% non-evaluable rate and a Type I error rate for each 
cladribine group versus the placebo group at 2.5%. 
Randomisation 
Subjects who satisfied the entry criteria were equally randomized (1:1:1) by a central randomization system 
and allocated a computer-generated treatment randomization number. Randomization occurred within the 
investigational sites. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind trial. A Treating Physician viewed clinical laboratory evaluations and assessed 
adverse events (AEs) and safety information, while an independent Evaluating Physician, who was blinded to 
treatment, performed neurological examinations. A central neuroradiology center, also blinded to treatment, 
assessed MRIs. 
Subjects received cladribine tablets or matching placebo. All subjects within a specific weight range received 
the same number of tablets per course. Subjects in the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg group received placebo tablets 
in courses three and four to maintain blinding with the cladribine 5.25 mg/kg group. 
The blinding could only be broken for an individual subject in the case of an emergency, when knowledge of 
the investigational medicinal product (IMP) was essential for the clinical management of the subject. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis Populations 
The analysis sets defined by the protocol consisted of:  
• 
• 
Intent-to-treat (ITT) population, comprising all subjects who were randomized into the trial. 
Evaluable population composed of the subjects who completed treatment without a major protocol 
deviation with 96-week data. 
•  Safety population, including all subjects who received at least one dose of trial medication with 
follow-up safety data. 
The ITT and Safety populations were the primary analysis populations for efficacy and safety analyses, 
respectively. The Evaluable population was utilized as the supportive analysis population. 
Evaluation of Efficacy 
All tests were two-sided and performed at the 5% significance level. For the analysis of baseline continuous 
parameters, confirmation of the ANOVA model assumptions (normality) was conducted. Normality was 
assessed using the normal probability plot and the Shapiro-Wilk statistic. If the model assumptions were 
satisfied, the ANOVA model with fixed effects for treatment and region was performed on the raw data; 
otherwise, the ANOVA model with fixed effects for treatment and region was performed on the ranked data. 
Primary and secondary efficacy analyses were performed on the ITT population.  
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 43/131 
  
  
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The qualifying relapse rate was analysed using a Poisson regression model with fixed effects for treatment 
group and region with log of time on study as an offset variable in the model. An approximate Chi-square 
test based on Wald statistics was used to compare treatment groups. In addition, the relative risk of 
developing a qualifying relapse and its associated 95% CI (97.5% CI) was estimated for each treatment 
group comparison. Annualised qualifying relapse rate and its associated 95% CI (97.5% CI) was estimated 
for each treatment group.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
A hierarchical test was used for the following three MRI parameters: the mean number of active T1 
gadolinium-enhanced (Gd+) lesions per subject per scan during 96 weeks, the mean number of active T2 
lesions per subject per scan during 96 weeks, and the mean number of combined unique (CU) lesions per 
subject per scan during 96 weeks. These MRI parameters were tested in hierarchical order following the 
testing of the primary efficacy parameter, and only for those cladribine doses that were determined to be 
significantly superior to placebo for the primary efficacy parameter. If both of the cladribine doses were 
determined to be significantly superior to placebo, then an α of 5% was used in the testing of these MRI 
parameters. If only one of the doses was significantly different from placebo, then only that dose at α of 
2.5% was tested for these MRI parameters.  
These MRI parameters were analysed using a non-parametric ANCOVA (analysis of covariance) model on 
ranked data with fixed effects for treatment group and region with adjustment for T1 Gd+ lesion, as there 
was no available baseline data for baseline T2 or CU lesions. 
The proportion of qualifying relapse-free subjects at the end of 96 weeks was analysed using a logistic 
regression model with fixed effects for treatment group and region. The odds ratio of being qualifying 
relapse-free in each of the cladribine groups versus the placebo group and the associated 95% (97.5%) CI 
was estimated. 
Time to 3-month sustained change in EDSS score was analysed using a Cox proportional hazards model with 
fixed effects for treatment group and region. An approximate Chi-square test based on Wald statistic was 
used to compare each cladribine group versus the placebo group. The hazard ratio of time to 3-month 
sustained change in EDSS score in each of the cladribine groups versus the placebo group and the associated 
95% (97.5%) CI was estimated. Kaplan-Meier plots of time to 3-month sustained change in EDSS score 
(survival function) were presented by treatment group.  
Results 
Participant flow 
A  total  of  1,641  patients  were  screened  for  enrollment  into  the  trial.  Of  these  patients,  1,326  were 
randomized (1:1:1) into the trial and 315 were screening failures.

Figure 3 - Disposition of Subjects for Treatment Completion and Study Completion 
The most common reason for treatment discontinuation was the "adverse event" for which the cladribine 
5.25 mg/kg group displayed a higher rate (7.7%) compared to the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg (3.5%) and placebo 
(2.1%) groups.

Recruitment 
A total of 1,326 patients were randomized into the trial from 155 investigative sites across 32 countries 
worldwide. Date of first patient first visit was 20 Apr 2005 and date of last patient last visit was 12 Nov 2008.

Nine protocol amendments were issued for this trial. Four of them were to adapt the protocol to country-
specific regulations. The rest of them included smaller modifications, e.g. further specifying the MRI criteria 
for MS, introducing additional pregnancy testing prior to retreatment and including mean brain atrophy 
measurements at baseline and at 48 weeks. 
The major protocol deviations were established prior to database lock. Subjects in the ITT population with 
major protocol deviations were excluded from the Evaluable population. Some of these protocol deviations 
were: history of malignancy (n=2), compromised blinding (n=4) and reports of pregnancy (n=23). 
Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics  
Demographic characteristics were well balanced for the cladribine 5.25 mg/kg, cladribine 3.5 mg/kg, and 
placebo groups (see Table 4). No statistically significant differences were observed among any of the 
demographic characteristics. The mean age (years) was 39.1 for the cladribine 5.25 mg/k group, 37.9 for the 
cladribine 3.5 mg/kg group and 38.7 for the placebo group. Most subjects were white (>97%) and 
approximately 70% were female. Demographic characteristics for the Evaluable population were similar to 
those in the ITT population.

Multiple Sclerosis History 
In general, MS history characteristics were well balanced across the 3 treatment groups (see Table 5). There 
was a shorter median time from first attack prior to Trial Day 1 in the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg treatment group 
compared  to  the  other  two  groups.  The  majority  (>94%)  of  the  patients  experienced  one  or  two  relapses

within  the  12  months  prior  to  Study  Day  1.  Only  one  or  two  patients  in  each  treatment  group  received 
treatment in the 3 months prior to Study Day 1. 
MS history characteristics for the Evaluable population were similar to those in the ITT population. 
Table 5 - Multiple Sclerosis History by Treatment Group – ITT Population 
Baseline Neurological and MRI assessment 
The baseline MRI and neurological assessments were also well balanced across the 3 treatment groups with 
few exceptions (see Table 6). The mean (SD) number of T1 hypointense lesions was greater for the cladribine 
5.25  mg/kg  group  compared  to  cladribine  3.5  mg/kg  and  placebo  (8.5  [9.3],  7.1  [8.2]  and  7.4  [8.0], 
respectively),  and  the  mean  T2  lesion  volume  (mm3)  was  greater  in  the  cladribine  5.25  mg/kg  group 
compared  to  cladribine  3.5  mg/kg  and  placebo  (17202.1  [17467.7],  14828.0  [16266.8],  and  14287.6 
[13104.8], respectively).  
The baseline MRI and neurological assessments for the Evaluable population were similar to those in the ITT 
population.

Prior and Concomitant Medication 
A greater proportion of patients in the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg group were naïve to DMD treatment compared to 
the cladribine 5.25 mg/kg and placebo groups (73.9%, 67.8%, and 67.5%, respectively). There was similar 
access  across  the  spectrum  of  DMD  agents  previously  used  by  patients  within  the  three  treatment  groups, 
with  prior  treatment  with  Copaxone®  varying  the  most  (8.3%,  4.4%,  and  6.6%,  for  the  cladribine  5.25 
mg/kg group, cladribine 3.5 mg/kg and placebo groups, respectively). 
The majority of concomitant medications taken by subjects during the trial were treatments commonly used 
by  MS  patients 
to 
treat  MS-related  symptoms  such  as  paracetamol,  acetylsalicylic  acid  and 
methylprednisolone.  Administration  of  antibiotics  for  systemic  use  was  comparable  in  all  three  treatments 
groups  (n=158  cladribine  5.25  mg/kg;  n=147  cladribine  3.5  mg/kg;  n=147  placebo).  The  placebo  group 
utilized a greater amount of corticosteroids for systemic use (n=124 cladribine 5.25 mg/kg; n=113 cladribine 
3.5 mg/kg; n=211 placebo). 
Numbers analysed 
Of  the  1326  subjects  included  in  the  ITT  population,  456  were  randomized  to  the  cladribine  5.25  mg/kg 
group,  433  were  randomized  to  the  cladribine  3.5  mg/kg  group  and  437  were  randomized  to  the  placebo 
group.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The  annualized  qualifying  relapse  rates  (ARR)  were  0.15  for  cladribine  5.25  mg/kg,  0.14  for  cladribine  3.5 
mg/kg, and 0.33 for placebo. Treatment with cladribine 5.25 mg/kg resulted in a 54.5% relative reduction in 
annualized  qualifying  relapse  rate  compared  to  placebo  (p<0.001).  Treatment  with  cladribine  3.5  mg/kg 
resulted in a 57.6% relative reduction in annualized qualifying relapse rate compared to placebo (p<0.001). 
As  compared  to  placebo,  the  relative  risk  of  developing  a  qualifying  relapse  for  each  cladribine  group  was 
35% and 54% for cladribine 5.25 mg/kg; and 34% and 54% for cladribine 3.5 mg/kg.

Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
•  Proportion of Qualifying Relapse-free Subjects 
A  total  of  78.9%  of  subjects  in  the  cladribine  5.25  mg/kg  group,  79.7%  of  subjects  in  the  cladribine 
3.5 mg/kg group, and 60.9% of subjects in the placebo group remained relapse-free at Week 96.

The OR was 2.43 (p<0.001; 95% CI of the OR=1.81; 3.27) for the cladribine 5.25 mg/kg group compared to 
the placebo group, indicating that the odds of subjects treated with cladribine 5.25 mg/kg remaining relapse-
free during the 96 weeks of therapy were 2.43 times higher than the odds of subjects treated with placebo. 
The OR was 2.53 (p<0.001; 95% CI of the OR=1.87; 3.43) for the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg group compared 
with the placebo group, indicating that the odds of subjects treated with cladribine 3.5 mg/kg remaining 
relapse-free during the 96 weeks of therapy were 2.53 times higher than the odds of subjects treated with 
placebo. 
•  Time to 3-month Confirmed EDSS Progression 
Treatment with cladribine 5.25 mg/kg and cladribine 3.5 mg/kg significantly prolonged the time to 3-month 
sustained change in EDSS score over 96 weeks compared to placebo. The HR was 0.69 (p = 0.026; 95% CI 
of the HR=0.49; 0.96) for cladribine 5.25 mg/kg compared to placebo, indicating that subjects in the 
cladribine 5.25 mg/kg group had a 31% reduction in the risk of experiencing a 3-month sustained change in 
their EDSS score compared to placebo. The HR was 0.67 (p = 0.018; 95% CI of the HR=0.48; 0.93) for 
cladribine 3.5 mg/kg compared to placebo, indicating that subjects in the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg group had a 
33% reduction in the risk to experience a 3-month sustained change in their EDSS score compared to 
placebo. 
•  Time to 6-month Confirmed EDSS Progression (post-hoc analysis) 
Treatment with cladribine prolonged the time to 6-month sustained change in EDSS score over 96 weeks 
compared to placebo. The HR was 0.68 (p= 0.0332; 95% CI of the HR=0.47;0.97) for cladribine 5.25 mg/kg 
compared to placebo, indicating that subjects in the cladribine 5.25 mg/kg group had a 32% reduction in the 
risk of experiencing a 6-month sustained change in their EDSS score compared to placebo. The HR was 0.53 
(p=0.0016; 95% CI of the HR=0.36;0.79) for cladribine 3.5 mg/kg compared to placebo, indicating that 
subjects in the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg group had a 47% reduction in the risk of experiencing a 6-month 
sustained change in their EDSS score compared to placebo. 
•  Mean Number of Active T1 Gadolinium-enhanced Lesions per Subject per Scan at 96 Weeks 
The adjusted mean number of active T1 Gd+ lesions per subject per scan at Week 96 for the cladribine 
5.25 mg/kg, cladribine 3.5 mg/kg, and placebo groups were 0.11, 0.12 and 0.91, respectively.  
Subjects treated with cladribine 5.25 mg/kg had a significantly lower mean number of active T1 Gd+ lesions 
per subject per scan when compared to those treated with placebo during the 96 week treatment period 
(p<0.001). This represents an 88% relative reduction in mean number of active T1 Gd+ lesions per subject 
per scan for cladribine 5.25 mg/kg. 
Similarly, subjects treated with cladribine 3.5 mg/kg experienced a significantly lower mean number of active 
T1 Gd+ lesions per subject per scan when compared to those treated with placebo during the 96 week 
treatment period (p<0.001). This represents an 86% relative reduction in mean number of active T1 Gd+ 
lesions per subject per scan for cladribine 3.5 mg/kg. 
•  Mean Number of Active T2 Lesions per Subject per Scan at 96 weeks 
The adjusted mean number of active T2 lesions per subject per scan at Week 96 for the cladribine 
5.25 mg/kg, cladribine 3.5 mg/kg, and placebo groups were 0.33, 0.38 and 1.43, respectively.  
Subjects treated with cladribine 5.25 mg/kg experienced significantly lower mean number of active T2 lesions 
per subject per scan when compared to those treated with placebo during the 96 week treatment period

•  Mean Number of CU Lesions per Subject per Scan at 96 weeks 
The mean number of CU lesions per subject per scan at Week 96 for the cladribine 5.25 mg/kg, cladribine 
3.5 mg/kg, and placebo groups were 0.38, 0.43 and 1.72, respectively.  
Subjects treated with cladribine 5.25 mg/kg experienced significantly lower mean number of CU lesions per 
subject per scan when compared to those treated with placebo during the 96 week treatment period 
(p<0.001). This represents a relative reduction of 78% in the mean number of CU lesions per subject per

per scan. 
Post hoc analysis in patients with High Disease Activity (HDA) 
The HDA definition was developed in line with a CHMP scientific advice using the definitions for highly active 
disease previously agreed for other DMDs, considering a number of clinical relapses in a previous year as well 
as a number of T1 Gd+ or T2 lesions as criteria to build this definition.  
The resulting HDA subgroups are descripted below, and compared in Table 9: 
•  HDA1: 
(a)   Subjects with at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on DMD therapy and at least 1 T1 Gd+ 
lesion or 9 T2 lesions, OR 
(b)   Subjects with 2 or more relapses in the previous year (no prior use of DMD at any time in subject 
history or duration of previous DMD therapy less than 1 year) and at least 1 T1 Gd+ lesion. 
•  HDA2: Subjects with 2 or more relapses in previous year (regardless of previous treatment status) 
•  HDA3: Subjects with 2 or more relapses in previous year (regardless of previous treatment status), AND 
at least: 1 T1 Gd+ lesion OR 9 T2 lesions. 
•  HDA4: 
(a)   Subjects with at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on DMD therapy and at least 1 T1 Gd+ 
lesion or 9 T2 lesions, OR 
(b)   Subjects with 2 or more relapses in the previous year (regardless of previous treatment status).

Results by HDA Subgroup  
With regards to the ARR for HDA1, HDA2, HDA3, and HDA4 in subjects treated with 3.5 mg/kg cladribine in 
CLARITY, the relative risk ratios ranged from 0.38 to 0.32, indicating a relative risk reduction of 62% to 68%. 
The relative risk ratios in HDA subgroups with the 5.25 mg/kg cladribine dose ranged from 0.25 to 0.39.  
In general, the effect of cladribine compared to placebo was larger across all HDA subgroups compared to the 
respective non-HDA groups. However, the differences did not reach statistical significance, although it 
became close for HDA2 versus non-HDA2 patients (p=0.0683 for cladribine 3.5mg/kg).

For the time to 3-month confirmed EDSS progression in subjects treated with 3.5 mg/kg cladribine, the 
HRs (95% CI) for HDA2, HDA3 and HDA4 were 0.28 (0.15, 0.54), 0.30 (0.15, 0.59) and 0.28 (0.15, 0.54), 
respectively, indicating a risk reduction of 72%, 70% and 72%. HDA2, HDA3 and HDA4 showed higher 
responses to cladribine 3.5 mg/kg than their non-HDA complementary subgroups (subgroup by treatment 
interaction resulted in p=0.0061, p=0.0140, and p=0.0079, respectively). HDA1, with a smaller subject 
number and a wider confidence interval, had point estimates that also favoured cladribine 3.5 mg/kg over 
placebo (HR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.35, 1.70), but no advantage compared to non-HDA1 was observed.  
In subjects receiving the 5.25 mg/kg dose, the HRs in HDA subgroups ranged from 0.32 to 0.41, with risk 
reductions of 62%, 65%, 68% and 59% seen in the HDA1 to HDA4 subgroups, respectively, and 40% (HR 
0.60) in the overall population. 
For the time to 6-month confirmed EDSS progression in subjects treated with 3.5 mg/kg cladribine, the 
HR for the HDA2, HDA3, and HDA4 subgroups was 0.18 in each case, indicating a risk reduction of 82%. The

HDA2, HDA3 and HDA4 subgroups showed consistent and higher responses to cladribine 3.5 mg/kg than their 
non-HDA complementary subgroups. A subgroup by treatment interaction was nominally statistically 
significant for HDA2 (p=0.0036), HDA3 (p=0.0061) and HDA4 (p=0.0037) indicating better efficacy of 
cladribine in HDA subjects compared to non-HDA subjects. HDA1, with a smaller subject number and a wider 
confidence interval, had point estimates that also favoured cladribine 3.5 mg/kg over placebo, but did not 
reach significance compared to non-HDA1. 
In subjects receiving the 5.25 mg/kg dose, the HRs in HDA subgroups ranged from 0.33 to 0.38, with risk 
reductions of 62%, 67%, 67% and 63% seen in the HDA1 to HDA4 subgroups, respectively, and 32% (HR 
0.68) in the overall population.

Subgroups for 3.5 mg/kg vs Placebo - CLARITY 
For the relative risk of cumulative new T1 Gd+ lesions in subjects treated with 3.5 mg/kg cladribine the 
relative risk ratio (95% CI) for the HDA1, HDA2, HDA3, and HDA4 subgroups was 0.08 (0.042, 0.147), 0.09 
(0.052, 0.144), 0.08 (0.045, 0.132) and 0.08 (0.046, 0.128), indicating a risk reduction of 92%, 91%, 92% 
and 92% in cumulative new T1  Gd+ lesions.  
In subjects receiving the 5.25 mg/kg dose, the relative risk in HDA subgroups ranged from 0.02 to 0.03, with 
risk reductions of 97%, 98%, 98% and 97% seen in the HDA1 to HDA4 subgroups, respectively. No 
difference between HAD and non-HAD subgroups was observed. Similar results were seen for analyses 
performed for active T2 lesions and CU lesions.  
For the assessment of disease-free status, No Evidence of Disease Activity (NEDA) was selected and 
defined as no relapses, no EDSS progression, no T1 Gd+ lesions and no active T2 lesions. For the proportion 
of subjects with NEDA in the 3.5 mg/kg cladribine group, the ORs (95% CI) for the HDA1, HDA2, HDA3, and

HDA4 subgroups were 5.49 (1.17, 17.58), 8.02 (3.93, 16.35), 7.06 (3.40, 14.65) and 7.82 (4.03, 15.19). 
Observed point estimates in HDA subgroups were systematically more favourable than the respective non-
HDA subgroups although not reaching nominal significance except for HDA4 (p=0.0435). 
In subjects receiving the 5.25 mg/kg dose, the ORs in HDA subgroups were 10.32, 7.91, 7.63 and 7.59 in the 
HDA1 to HDA4 subgroups, respectively, and 4.75 in the overall population. Observed point estimates in HDA

Figure 5 – Schematic Overview of CLARITY EXT Study Design 
This extension trial was initiated after 723 of the subjects enrolled in CLARITY (54%) had already completed 
that trial, resulting in a gap in prospective data collection of varying length between these subjects’ final 
visits in CLARITY and their first visits in CLARITY EXT. Similarly, 52 out of the 636 subjects who ultimately 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 55/131 
  
  
 
entered the supplemental follow-up phase (8%) had completed the double-blind period of CLARITY EXT 
before this phase was introduced by Protocol Amendment 3 on 28 April 2010.  
Methods 
Study participants  
Main inclusion criteria 
-  Randomization in CLARITY and completed scheduled visits for the full 96 weeks. 
-  No medical history or evidence of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) or TB, as evidenced by TB skin test or 
chest X-ray (this criterion was added in Amendment 2 to the Clinical Study Protocol). 
-  Following Protocol Amendment 2, subjects had to have all of the following laboratory  haematologic 
parameters evaluated as normal (as defined below, inclusively) within 28 days of  first dosing of blinded 
study medication at extension Study Day 1 for retreatment to occur:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Haemoglobin = 11.6 – 16.2 g/dL  
Leukocyte (total white blood cell [WBC]) count = 4.1 – 12.3 × 103/µL  
Absolute lymphocyte count  (ALC) = 1.02 – 3.36 × 103/µL  
Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) = 2.03 – 8.36 × 103/µL  
Platelet count = 140-450 × 103/µL 
Main Exclusion Criteria 
-  Inadequate liver function, defined by total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase 
or alkaline phosphatase >2.5 times the upper limit of the nomal values 
-  History of active or chronic infectious disease or any disease which compromises immune function (e.g. 
HIV+, Lyme disease) 
-  Positive stool heme-occult test at Pre-Study Evaluation 
-  History of seizures not adequately controlled by medications 
Treatments 
During the 96-week double-blind phase of this extension study, cladribine and matching placebo were 
administered as 2 treatment courses separated by 1 year. Only the lower dose of cladribine used in CLARITY 
was administered (total cumulative dose of 3.5 mg/kg) 
Each treatment course consisted of 2 treatment weeks separated by 1 month, and each treatment week 
consisted of 4 or 5 days on which eligible patients received 1 or 2 tablets (10 mg or 20 mg of cladribine or 
matching placebo) as a single daily dose, dependent on body weight. 
Subjects randomized to placebo during CLARITY were assigned to low-dose oral cladribine.   
Subjects randomized to oral cladribine during CLARITY were re-randomized in a 2:1 allocation ratio to receive 
either low-dose oral cladribine or placebo. 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 56/131 
  
  
The randomized treatment groups were defined as follows: 
•  Cladribine high/low dose (HLLL): subjects randomized to high-dose cladribine in the first 48 
weeks and low-dose cladribine in the second 48 weeks of CLARITY, and to low-dose cladribine in 
CLARITY EXT (the total cumulative dose expected was 8.75 mg/kg). 
•  Cladribine low/low dose (LLLL): subjects randomized to low-dose cladribine for all 96 weeks of 
CLARITY and in CLARITY EXT (the total cumulative dose expected was 7.0 mg/kg). 
•  Cladribine high dose/placebo (HLPP): subjects randomized to high-dose cladribine in the first 48 
weeks and low-dose cladribine in the second 48 weeks of CLARITY, and to placebo in CLARITY EXT 
(the total cumulative dose expected was 5.25 mg/kg). 
•  Cladribine low dose/placebo (LLPP): subjects randomized to low-dose cladribine for all 96 weeks 
of CLARITY and to placebo in CLARITY EXT (the total cumulative dose expected was 3.5 mg/kg). 
•  Placebo/cladribine low dose (PPLL): Subjects randomized to placebo for all 96 weeks of CLARITY 
and assigned to low-dose cladribine in CLARITY EXT (the total cumulative dose expected was 3.5 
mg/kg). 
The requirements for permitted, prohibited and rescue medication were the same as for CLARITY. 
For subjects who had to delay entry into the CLARITY Extension study or the 24-Week safety follow-up 
phase, whereby there was a gap interval of varying duration, and who during this interval received a DMD, 
the study protocol indicated that they had to discontinue the DMD for a period of at least 3 months prior to 
Study Day 1. Subjects who were unable or unwilling to discontinue their DMD could not be re-randomized to 
receive study medication. These subjects were encouraged to enter the study but could only be followed for 
safety. 
Objectives 
The primary objectives of the study were related to safety: 
• 
• 
To evaluate the safety of extended treatment with oral cladribine when administered according to a 
fixed annual dosing schedule to patients who completed CLARITY. 
To assess the safety of cladribine with an emphasis on cardiac repolarization as measured by changes 
in QT interval (in a subset of patients also participating in PK sampling and analysis). 
Amongst the explorative objectives was to determine the long-term benefit of treatment with oral cladribine 
vs. placebo. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy Endpoints (selected endpoints) 
• 
Proportion of subjects “qualifying” relapse-free. A qualifying relapse was defined as a two grade 
increase in one or more Kurtzke Functional Systems (KFS) or a one grade increase in two or more 
KFS, excluding changes in bowel/bladder or cognition, in the absence of fever, lasting for ≥24 hours, 
and preceded by at least 30 days of clinical stability or improvement 
•  Disability progression, defined as an increase in the EDSS scale of at least 1.0 point compared to 
baseline if baseline EDSS score was ≥0.5 or ≤4.5; ≥1.5 points if the baseline EDSS score was zero; 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 57/131 
  
  
and ≥0.5 points if the baseline EDSS score was ≥5.0. The following two progression endpoints were 
to be used: (i) Time to confirmed EDSS progression, confirmed after 3 months, and (ii) Time to 
confirmed EDSS progression, confirmed after 6 months. 
• 
Time to treatment start with rescue medication. 
•  Annualized “qualifying” relapse rate. 
• 
Time to first “qualifying” relapse. 
•  MRI efficacy endpoints included: 
−  Number of new T1 gadolinium-enhancing lesions. 
−  Number of active T2 lesions. 
−  Number of CU lesions, defined as (i) new T1 gadolinium-enhancing, or (ii) new or enlarging 
T2 lesions 
Sample size 
The number of subjects eligible to enter this study was limited by the enrolment, retention, and roll-over of 
patients from the preceding CLARITY study. Therefore, no statistical estimation of the sample size was 
performed. 
Randomisation 
Treatment allocation for the double-blind phase of CLARITY EXT was performed using a central randomization 
system, and depended on the subject’s initial treatment randomization in CLARITY (see treatment above).  
Subjects were assigned to treatment using a central interactive voice response system. 
Blinding (masking) 
This study was double-blinded. Cladribine tablets and matching placebo tablets were provided to the sites in 
identical blister packages, each containing up to 10 tablets.  
Only the Treating Physician – but not the Evaluating Physician (responsible for the neurological assessment) 
– had access to laboratory data in order to make safety assessments. 
The blind could be broken for an individual patient only in the case of an emergency when knowledge of the 
assigned treatment was essential for the clinical management of the patient.  
Statistical methods 
Analysis Sets 
The protocol defined the following data sets for analysis: 
• 
The Enrolled Analysis Set included all subjects who were enrolled in CLARITY EXT and signed an 
Informed Consent. 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 58/131 
  
  
• 
• 
• 
The ITT Analysis Set consisted of all subjects who were randomized or assigned to treatment in 
CLARITY EXT, analysed as randomized/assigned. 
The Safety Analysis Set comprised all subjects who received at least one dose of IMP in CLARITY EXT 
and had at least one safety assessment during the double-blind phase, analyzed as 
randomized/assigned. 
The Safety Follow-up Analysis Set included all subjects who were enrolled and had at least one safety 
assessment, but were not randomized or assigned to treatment because they were not eligible to 
receive study medication: subjects were analysed as randomized in CLARITY. 
All statistical tests comparing treatment arms were two-sided and conducted at the 2.5% level. CIs were 
two-sided with a confidence level of 97.5%, unless otherwise specified. A p-value less than 0.025 was 
considered to be “nominally” significant, given that all hypothesis tests were exploratory and were not pre-
specified. 
Efficacy data were summarised descriptively by randomised/assigned treatment group. Efficacy analyses 
were performed for the ITT analysis set only and included the following between-group comparisons: 
• 
Late treatment group (PPLL) vs. early treatment group (LLPP) 
•  192-week treatment group vs. 96-week treatment group: two comparisons, low-dose (LLLL vs. LLPP) 
and high-dose (HLLL vs. HLPP) 
•  Active treatment group (LLLL + HLLL) vs. placebo treatment group (LLPP + HLPP). 
Within-group comparisons of the effect of treatment during the CLARITY EXT period were also performed  for 
HLLL, LLLL, PPLL and LLPP (with the exception of “time to event” endpoints), using data from both CLARITY 
and CLARITY EXT, i.e. 192 weeks vs. 96 weeks. 
For the proportion of relapse-free subjects and the proportions of subjects with no lesions, the odds ratio for 
treatment effect (and 97.5% CI) was estimated for the between group comparisons using a logistic 
regression model with fixed effects for treatment group and region; treatment effect was tested using a Wald 
test. Within-group comparisons: The effect of treatment during the CLARITY EXT period on proportion of 
subjects relapse-free (or proportion with no lesions) was analysed using McNemar’s test. 
Kaplan-Meier plots of probability of surviving event-free were presented by treatment group and time-to-
event percentiles (and 95% CIs) were reported for time to first and second relapses, time to confirmed 
progression in EDSS and time to start of rescue medication. Between-group comparisons were based on the 
hazard ratio for treatment effect (and 97.5% CI), which was estimated using a Cox proportional hazards 
model with fixed effects for treatment group and region; treatment effect was tested using a Wald test. No 
between-group comparisons were performed for time to start of rescue medication because only 7 of the 806 
ITT subjects received any rescue medication.  
Annualised “qualifying” relapse rate and associated 97.5% CI was presented by treatment group. Between-
group comparisons included the relapse rate ratio for treatment effect (and 97.5% CI), which was estimated 
using a Poisson regression model with number of relapses as dependent variable, fixed effects for treatment 
group and region, and with the log of time on study as an offset variable; treatment effect was tested using a 
Wald test. Percent reduction in relapse rate was estimated using the same model. Within-group comparisons 
were performed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test (the null hypothesis was that the median difference 
between the pairs of rates was zero).

Between-group comparisons for the number of lesions were based on the lesion rate ratio for treatment 
effect (and 97.5% CI), which was estimated using a negative binomial model with cumulative number of 
lesions as dependent variable, fixed effects for treatment group and region, with baseline T1 Gd+ lesion 
count as a covariate, and with the log of the number of scans as an offset variable. Percent reduction in 
lesion rate was estimated using the same model. Within-group comparisons: were performed using the 
Wilcoxon signed rank test.  
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 1,326 patients were randomised into CLARITY. Of these, 883 patients were screened for 
participation in CLARITY EXT, 867 were enrolled and 806 were randomised or assigned to treatment (LLPP: 
98, HLPP: 92, LLLL: 186, HLLL: 186, PPLL: 244). Of the 806 patients who were randomised/assigned to 
treatment, 738 completed the 96-week double-blind phase of the study and 650 completed the planned 
study treatment. 
The most frequent reasons for study discontinuation were “other” (45 patients) and lost to follow-up 
(12 patients); 6 patients discontinued due to AEs, 3 patients died, and 2 were withdrawn because of protocol 
deviations. Of the 45 patients in the category “other,” the majority stated verbatim terms such as withdrawal 
of consent/patient’s decision/refusal (n=36). 
The most frequent reasons for treatment discontinuation were AEs (89 patients) and “other” (53 patients); 
9 patients were lost to follow-up, 3 patients died (the same patients for whom death was cited as the reason 
for study discontinuation), and 2 patients stopped treatment due to disease progression.  
Patient disposition and reasons for discontinuation during the double-blind phase of the extension study are 
presented in Table 12.

Patients were enrolled in 133 centers in 30 countries including Australia, the US and countries in Europe, Asia 
and South America.   
The study period was February 2008 to December 2011 (first patient’s first visit to last patient’s last visit). 
Conduct of the study 
The original protocol, dated 03 July 2007, was amended four times. One amendment applied to France only 
(Amendment 1). 
Protocol Amendment 2 (all countries; 16 December 2008) aimed at addressing potential safety issues 
identified by the Sponsor. To prevent the risk of treating a subject with a coincident laboratory 
haematological Grade 3 or Grade 4 toxicity, study procedures were amended to assure that a subject’s

haematological status was known prior to dosing with blinded study medication. Changes included 
introduction of an entry criterion requiring haematological values within normal ranges, modification of 
laboratory criteria for retreatment, and specification that subjects were not to take the study medication 
dispensed at Weeks 5 and 52 until instructed to do so by site staff, following confirmation that laboratory 
values were within acceptable limits. 
Protocol Amendment 3 (all countries; 28 April 2010) introduced an Interim Analysis and the 24-week 
supplemental follow-up phase that would provide extended monitoring and safety assessment of subjects 
who completed the double-blind phase. 
Protocol Amendment 4 (all countries; 28 February 2011): The main purposes of this amendment were to 
clarify the roles of the Treating Physician and Evaluating Physician and to ensure consistent guidance 
regarding the use of contraception by female subjects following the last dose of study medication. 
During the 96-week double-blind period of the study, a total of 27 major protocol deviations were identified 
in a total of 26 patients in the combined ITT Analysis Set. All deviations were identified prior to the database 
lock and described in the study report. The majority of protocol deviations (24) were related to use of 
another investigational drug, use of prohibited medications, use of DMD within 3 months of Study Day 1, 
extended use of steroids, or underdosing (insufficient compliance). Three patients continued study treatment 
despite a positive pregnancy test. 
Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics 
Baseline age at entry into CLARITY EXT ranged from 20 to 67 years, with an overall mean (SD) of 41.1 
(10.1) years and a median of 41.0 years. 65.9% were female and a great majority of patients were White 
(97.6% overall). Patient weight ranged from 40.0 to 120.4 kg at entry into CLARITY EXT, with an overall 
mean (SD) of 69.4 (14.8) kg and median of 67.0 kg.  
Multiple Sclerosis History 
Time since first MS attack ranged from 2.2 to 44.2 years, with an overall mean (SD) of 11.0 (7.3) years and 
median of 9.1 years and without substantial differences between treatment groups. Nearly all ITT patients 
(773 patients or 95.9% overall) had abnormalities related to MS on neurological examination. Three patients 
(0.4% overall) had received DMD treatment during the 3 months before study entry (all in the PPLL group).  
Overall,  98  ITT  patients  (12.2%)  had  experienced  a  relapse  between  the  end  of  CLARITY  and  the  start  of 
CLARITY EXT; the percentage of patients with relapses between studies was 18.9% in the PPLL group (i.e., 
those patients randomized to placebo in CLARITY) compared to 8.7%-9.7% in the other treatment groups.  
Among  patients  experiencing  relapse  between  studies,  time  since  most  recent  relapse  ranged  from  0.1  to 
21.9 months, with an overall mean (SD) of 5.6 (4.5) months and median of 4.6 months.   
Baseline Neurological and MRI Assessment 
Results of neurological assessment at baseline of CLARITY EXT revealed differences between the groups 
randomized to cladribine and to placebo in CLARITY, with higher EDSS scores and a higher proportion of 
patients reporting relapses since completion of CLARITY in the PPLL group (who had been randomized to 
placebo in CLARITY) than in the other treatment groups.  
It is possible that this group included patients with relatively benign disease (less than 2 relapses and no 
sustained increase in EDSS) – who were thus able to complete the 96 weeks of CLARITY without need for

rescue medication which could only be offered after a second relapse or a sustained increase in EDSS had 
occurred– than the groups that received cladribine in CLARITY.  
• 
EDSS ranged from 0.0 to 6.5 in the ITT Analysis Set, with an overall mean (SD) of 2.90 (1.52) and 
median of 2.50. Median EDSS scores were 2.50 in all treatment groups but the PPLL group, for which 
the median was 3.00.  
•  Distributions of EDSS scores by category were generally similar across treatment groups, but there 
was a slight tendency towards higher scores in the PPLL group: 22.1% of PPLL patients had EDSS 
scores of 3.0-3.5 compared to ≤19.4% in the other groups; the percentage of PPLL patients with 
EDSS 4.0-4.5 was comparable to or lower than those in other groups, but 15.2% of PPLL patients 
had EDSS ≥5.0 compared to ≤13.3 in the other groups (Table 11–6).  
Results of MRI assessment at baseline of CLARITY EXT were generally similar across treatment groups in the 
ITT Analysis Set, although considerable variation was seen at the patient level. 
Considering treatment group means, the PPLL group (who had been randomized to placebo in CLARITY) had 
higher numbers of T1 Gd+ lesions and higher T1 Gd+ lesion volumes. The mean (SD) was 0.77 (1.85) in the 
PPLL group compared to 0.10-0.31 in the other groups; for T1 Gd+ lesion volume, the mean (SD) was 
132.30 (415.18) mm3 for PPLL compared to 18.45-49.19 mm3 in the other groups. Third quartiles showed 
the same pattern. 
Prior and Concomitant Medications 
In the ITT Analysis Set, a total of 610 subjects (75.7%) reported use of at least one concomitant medication 
during the double-blind phase. The kinds of medications reported were typical for an MS population, and 
were generally similar across treatment groups. 
Duration of the Gap Interval between CLARITY and CLARITY EXT 
CLARITY EXT was initiated after 54% of the patients enrolled in CLARITY had already completed the study, 
resulting in a gap interval of varying length between these patients’ final visits in CLARITY and their first 
visits in CLARITY EXT. Gap duration was similar across treatment groups, with group median values ranging 
from 39.5 to 43.1 weeks, and group maximum values ranging from 111.0 to 118.0 weeks (Table 11–4). 
Overall, 86 patients (10.7%) had a gap of ≤4 weeks, while 361 patients (44.8%) had a gap of >4 to ≤43 
weeks and 359 patients (44.5%) had a gap of >43 weeks. 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 883 subjects were screened, of whom 867 were enrolled and 806 were randomized or assigned to 
treatment. The number of patients in the ITT and Safety Analysis Set were the same between treatment 
groups (LLPP=98, HLPP=92, LLLL=186, HLLL=186 and PPLL=244). A total of 636 subjects entered the safety 
follow-up phase, and 621 subjects completed the 24 weeks follow-up. A total of 61 subjects who were not 
eligible to receive treatment were followed for safety only in the safety follow-up phase (placebo=22, 
cladribine 3.5 mg/kg= 17, cladribine 5.25 mg/kg=22).

Outcomes and estimation 
•  Annualized Qualifying Relapse Rate 
Annualized qualifying relapse rates were broadly similar across treatment groups (≤ 0.15 in all groups: 0.15 
for the LLPP group, 0.13 for the HLPP group, 0.10 for the LLLL group, 0.12 for the HLLL group, and 0.10 for 
the PPLL group). Of the within-group comparisons performed, the ARR during CLARITY differed significantly 
from that during CLARITY EXT only in the PPLL group where it decreased from 0.26 in Period 1 to 0.10 in 
Period 2 (p<0.0001). 
There were no obvious differences in ARR between subgroups defined by gap duration. In subjects with gap 
duration >4 weeks and ≤43 weeks, the ARR ranged from 0.10 to 0.17, and in those with gap duration 
>43 weeks, ARR ranged from 0.10 to 0.14.

Proportion of Subjects Qualifying Relapse-Free 
More than 75% of subjects in all treatment groups whose relapse status was known were “qualifying” 
relapse-free over the entire extension trial, including the safety follow-up phase phase: the proportions 
ranged from 75.3% and 81.2%, with no discernible difference between the LLPP and HLPP groups and the 
HLLL group where subjects received the highest cumulative (continuous) cladribine dose. Follow-up time was 
comparable across treatment groups: medians by treatment group ranged from 122.9 to 123.9 weeks.

The percentage of subjects who were “qualifying” relapse-free during both trials was lower in the PPLL group 
(51.3%) than in the groups randomized to cladribine in CLARITY (≥61.1%, with a maximum of 68.5% for 
LLLL compared to 61.1% for LLPP and 62.2% for HLLL). 
• 
Time to First Qualifying Relapse 
Considering the entire period comprising CLARITY, CLARITY EXT, and the gap between these periods, the 
estimated time at which 25% of subjects had experienced a first “qualifying” relapse, measured from Study 
Day 1 of CLARITY, was longer for the LLLL group and shorter for the PPLL group compared to the other 
treatment groups: 25th percentiles for time to first “qualifying” relapse were 1291 days for the LLLL group 
(95% CI: 762, 1655) and 470 days for the PPLL group (95% CI: 323, 596). Time to first “qualifying” relapse 
in the LLPP group was similar to that in the LLLL group: the 25th percentile for LLPP was 1047 days (95% CI: 
717, 1771).

• 
EDSS progression 
During CLARITY EXT, between 9/92 (9.8%) (HLPP group) and 18/98 (18.4%) (LLPP group) of subjects, 
experienced 3 month confirmed progression in EDSS. An estimated 10% of subjects experienced 3-month 
confirmed EDSS progression by 533 days in the LLPP group, 1009 days in the HLPP group, 596 days in the 
LLLL group, 498 days in the HLLL group, and 429 days in the PPLL group. Between-group comparisons based 
on the HR for treatment effect, adjusted for region, did not show statistically significant differences in time to 
3-month confirmed progression in EDSS during CLARITY EXT between the active and placebo treatment 
groups (HLLL and LLLL, and HLPP and LLPP), the high-dose 192 week and 96 week treatment groups (HLLL 
and HLPP), the low-dose 192 week and 96 week treatment groups (LLLL and LLPP), or the late and early 
treatment groups (PPLL and LLPP). 
Percentages of subjects experiencing 6-month confirmed progression in EDSS during CLARITY EXT were 
≤13.3% for all treatment groups. Between-group comparisons did not show nominally significant differences 
in time to 6-month confirmed progression in EDSS between the active and placebo treatment groups (HLLL 
and LLLL, and HLPP and LLPP), the high-dose 192 week and 96 week treatment groups (HLLL and HLPP), the 
low-dose 192 week and 96 week treatment groups (LLLL and LLPP), or the late and early treatment groups 
(PPLL and LLPP).

•  Mean number of New T1 Gadolinium-Enhanced Lesions 
During CLARITY EXT, the mean number of new T1 Gd+ lesions per subject per scan ranged from 0.0 to 12.2 
overall (see Table 16). 
Between-group comparisons for mean number of new T1 Gd+ lesions per subject per scan during CLARITY 
EXT were nominally significant for the active vs placebo groups (HLLL and LLLL, and HLPP and LLPP; 
p<0.001), the low-dose 192 week vs 96 week treatment groups (LLLL and LLPP; p<0.001), and the late vs 
early treatment groups (PPLL and LLPP; p=0.003), but not for the high-dose 192 week vs 96 week treatment 
groups (HLLL and HLPP; p=0.047).

Examination of the distribution of subjects with different mean numbers of lesions per subject per scan 
during CLARITY EXT showed higher proportions of subjects with mean values ≥1.0 in the groups randomized 
to placebo in CLARITY EXT - and particularly in the LLPP group - compared to those randomized to cladribine 
(11.6% for the LLPP group and 6.6% for the HLPP group, compared to ≤2.9% in the other groups). No 
subject in the LLLL group had a mean value of 1.0 or higher 
In the LLPP group, mean numbers of new T1 Gd+ lesions were higher among subjects with gap duration 
>43 weeks than among subjects with gap duration between 4 and 43 weeks or subjects with gap duration ≤4 
weeks. Proportions of subjects with a mean of ≥1 new T1 Gd+ lesion per scan were also higher among 
subjects with gap duration >43 weeks compared to the other subgroups. 
•  Mean number of active T2 Lesions  
The mean number of active T2 lesions per subject per scan ranged from 0.0 to 32.3 overall (mean number 
± SD: LLPP 1.42 ± 3.64; HLPP 1.44 ± 2.40; LLLL 0.88 ± 1.63; HLLL 1.13 ± 2.78; PPLL 1.07 ± 1.84). There 
was an initial increase in active T2 lesions observed in all treatment groups during the first year of CLARITY 
EXT. Between-group comparisons for mean number of active T2 lesions per subject per scan during CLARITY 
EXT were nominally significant for the active vs. placebo groups (HLLL + LLLL vs. HLPP + LLPP; p=0.019), 
with nominally significantly lower mean numbers of active T2 lesions per subject per scan in the group 
randomized to cladribine in CLARITY EXT, but not for the high-dose 192-week vs. 96-week treatment groups 
(HLLL vs. HLPP; p=0.028), the low-dose 192-week vs. 96-week treatment groups (LLLL vs. LLPP; p=0.260), 
or the late vs. early treatment groups (PPLL vs. LLPP; p=0.470). 
•  Mean number of CU Lesions 
The mean number of CU lesions per subject per scan ranged from 0.0 to 34.0 overall (mean number ± SD: 
LLPP 1.49 ± 3.82; HLPP 1.52 ± 2.59; LLLL 0.88 ± 1.63; HLLL 1.19 ± 3.07; PPLL 1.08 ± 1.86). Between-
group comparisons for mean number of CU lesions per subject per scan during CLARITY EXT showed lower 
mean numbers of lesions per subject per scan for the groups randomized to cladribine in CLARITY EXT. The 
difference was nominally significant for the active vs. placebo groups (HLLL + LLLL vs. HLPP + LLPP; 
p=0.016), but not for the high-dose 192-week vs. 96-week treatment groups (HLLL vs. HLPP; p=0.027), the 
low-dose 192-week vs. 96-week treatment groups (LLLL vs. LLPP; p=0.214), or the late vs. early treatment 
groups (PPLL vs. LLPP; p=0.387).

Annualized qualifying relapse rate at 96 weeks. A 
qualifying relapse was defined as a two grade 
increase in one or more KFS or a one grade increase 
in two or more KFS, excluding changes in 
bowel/bladder or cognition, in the absence of fever, 
lasting for ≥24 hours, and preceded by at least 30 
days of clinical stability or improvement. 
The annualized relapse rate for each treatment group 
was calculated as the total number of confirmed 
relapses divided by the total number of days on 
study multiplied by 365.25.

2.5.3.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Efficacy data from the CLARITY, CLARITY EXT, and ONWARD studies (see section on supportive studies) were 
pooled to assess ARR, EDSS progression and MRI endpoints across these studies. The ORACLE MS study was 
not included as it included patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) and utilized an event driven study 
design that did not provide the consistent 2 year observation period for all study subjects provided by 
CLARITY, CLARITY EXT, and ONWARD.  The intention of the pooling was to increase the number of patients in 
order to evaluate long term efficacy of treatment.  
Statistical analyses were conducted using 2 cohorts, as follows: 
1. 96 Weeks Double-Blind was an integrated analysis of CLARITY and ONWARD double-blind period only.  
2. DB plus EXT was an integrated analysis of CLARITY, CLARITY EXT, and ONWARD including all periods. The 
DB plus EXT cohort was conducted to allow reporting of long term efficacy endpoints. 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 73/131 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Furthermore, analyses were conducted for the overall pooled population as well as for subgroups by baseline 
characteristics and HDAs (same definition as in CLARITY). 
An overview of the number of subjects in the pooled analysis is presented below: 
Table 19 - Overview of Subjects in the Pooled Analysis 
Since there were no subjects treated with placebo for more than 2 years in the DB plus EXT cohort, 
comparisons with the active treatments groups were difficult to make. Considering this limitations, data are 
presented in the following for the 96 Week DB cohort only. 
The same criteria and definitions of the HDA subgroups as for CLARITY were applied, with the following

The numbers in the analysis cohorts were generally balanced except for HDA1. This is due to the uneven 
contribution from the 5.25 mg/kg dose group as there were fewer patients in 5.25 mg/kg in ONWARD study 
following a protocol amendment removing this dose from the study. 
Results (CLARITY and ONWARD - 96 Weeks Double-Blind Cohort) 
The relative risks of qualified ARR in RRMS subjects were consistent with the efficacy shown in the analysis 
of CLARITY alone. For cladribine 3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/kg, the HDA1, HDA2, HDA3, HDA4 and 
corresponding non-HDA subgroups were similar to the overall population in terms of ARR results (57% 
reduction)  with statistically significant reductions (p<0.0001) seen in these subgroups. Observed point 
estimates in HDA2 to HDA4 subgroups were systematically more favourable than their non-HDA 
counterparts, reaching nominal significance for HDA2. The relative risk ratios for HDA-subgroups range from 
0.44 to 0.33 indicating a risk reduction of 56% to 67% in ARR.

with Cladribine 3.5 mg/kg vs Placebo – 96 Week DB Cohort 
The HRs for the time to 3-month confirmed EDSS progression for HDA1, HDA2, HDA3, and HDA4 
subgroups treated with 3.5 mg/kg cladribine were 0.90, 0.40, 0.43 and 0.47, respectively, indicating a risk 
reduction of 10%, 60%, 57%, and 53% in time to 3-month confirmed EDSS progression. Observed point 
estimates in HDA2 to HDA4 subgroups were systematically more favourable than their non-HDA 
counterparts, reaching nominal significance for HDA2. In subjects receiving the 5.25 mg/kg dose, the HRs in 
HDA subgroups with the 5.25 mg/kg cladribine dose ranged from 0.33 to 0.51, with risk reductions of 49%, 
64%, 67% and 51% seen in the HDA1 to HDA4 subgroups, respectively, and 37% (HR 0.63) in the overall 
population. 
Consistent results in favour of both cladribine doses were observed across subgroups by baseline 
demographics; the results suggested greater effects in males compared to females (interaction p=0.0338) 
and in younger patients (≤40 years, interaction p=0.0422), however, this has to be interpreted with caution, 
given the multiplicity of testing. 
For the time to 6-month confirmed EDSS progression HR for HDA1, HDA2, HDA3, HDA4 and their 
counterpart non-HDA subgroups in subjects treated with 3.5 mg/kg cladribine in the 96 Week DB period the 
HRs were 0.78, 0.29, 0.30, and 0.40 respectively, indicating a risk reduction of 22%; 71%; 70%; and 60% 
in time to 6-month confirmed EDSS progression. Observed point estimates in HDA2 to HDA4 subgroups were 
systematically more favourable than their non-HDA counterparts, reaching nominal significance for HDA2 and 
HDA3. In subjects receiving the 5.25 mg/kg dose, the HRs in HDA subgroups with the 5.25 mg/kg cladribine 
dose ranged from 0.34 to 0.40, with risk reductions of 60%, 65%, 66%, and 60% seen in the HDA1-4

subgroups, respectively, and 30% (HR 0.70) in the overall population. Generally, consistent results in favour 
of cladribine (both doses) compared to placebo were observed across subgroups by baseline demographics. 
The relative risk ratio for the HDA1, HDA2, HDA3, and HDA4 subgroups treated with 3.5 mg/kg cladribine 
was 0.10, 0.08, 0.07 and 0.09, indicating a risk reduction of 90%, 92%, 93% and 91% in cumulative new 
T1 Gd+ lesions. Similar results were shown for the non-HDA counterpart subgroups. Results in all 
subgroups are consistent with the findings in the overall population (relative risk ratio of 0.10), which had 
indicated a risk reduction of 90%. In subjects receiving the 5.25 mg/kg dose, the relative risk ratios in HDA 
subgroups were all 0.03, with risk reductions of 97% seen in the HDA1 to HDA4 subgroups and 94% (relative 
risk ratio 0.06) in the overall population. Subgroup analyses by baseline demographics suggest a greater 
effect in males compared to females (interaction p=0.0002). 
Clinical studies in special populations 
No dedicated clinical studies in special populations were performed. The main studies included adult patients 
up to the age of 65 years. No clinical studies were performed in the paediatric populations or in patients older 
than 65 years. 
2.5.4.  Supportive studies 
Clinical study 26593 (ONWARD): A Phase II, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, safety, tolerability and efficacy study of add-on cladribine tablet therapy with 
Interferon-beta (IFN-β) treatment in multiple sclerosis (MS) subjects with active disease. 
The ONWARD study was a Phase IIb, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, safety, 
tolerability and efficacy study of add-on cladribine and IFN-β in subjects with active RMS despite treatment 
with IFN-β therapy. Patients with active disease were defined as having experienced at least 1 relapse in the 
48 weeks prior to study entry despite concurrent treatment with IFN-β. The study included subjects with 
RRMS and 14.5% of the subjects had secondary progressive MS (SPMS) with relapses. 
According to the original protocol, subjects were randomized into 3 arms: 
• 
Placebo + IFN-β (Rebif®) 
•  Cladribine 3.5 mg/kg (same course regimen as in CLARITY) + IFN-β 
•  Cladribine 5.25 mg/kg (same course regimen as in CLARITY) + IFN-β 
The study protocol was amended following early safety signals related to haematologic toxicities and re-
evaluation of procedures for re-dosing. The amendment resulted in elimination of the high dose cladribine 
treatment group (5.25 mg/kg), implementation of risk minimization procedures related to haematologic 
testing prior to blinded study medication dosing, expansion of entry criteria to allow the enrollment of 
subjects taking other IFN-β treatments. Furthermore, in June 2011, the Sponsor decided to no longer pursue 
new development plans for oral cladribine, resulting in discontinuation of treatment with cladribine 
(treatment with IFN-β was to continue), and reduction of the Extension period to a maximum of 48 weeks, 
for the purpose of collecting safety data. 
After the protocol amendments, a total of 172 subjects were randomized to the double-blind period, 
48 subjects to the placebo + IFN-β group and 124 subjects to the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg + IFN-β group. By 
Assessment report

the time of study termination (October 2011), all subjects had completed the scheduled 96 weeks of the 
double-blind period, allowing analysis of the planned efficacy endpoints.  
Overall, in the placebo and 3.5 mg/kg groups, a total of 197 SPMS or RRMS patients, all of whom had had 
superimposed relapses in the previous year, were randomized: 26 were SPMS and 171 were RRMS patients. 
The  primary  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  3.5  mg/kg  oral  cladribine  tablets  as  an 
add-on  to  injectable  IFN-β  treatments.  The  secondary  objective  was  to  explore  the  efficacy  on  qualifying 
relapse rate, progression of disability and lesion activity (MRI). 
Results 
With regard to patient demographics and baseline characteristics after protocol amendments, mean age and 
EDSS were similar across groups, although there was a notable difference in the mean number of T1 lesions 
between groups, explained by the inclusion of a few subjects with a high load of T1 lesions in the cladribine 
3.5 mg/kg + IFN-β group with a maximum value of 34 whereas in the placebo + IFN-β group the maximum 
value was 6, while the median was zero in both groups. 
Annualized Qualifying Relapse Rate (ITT Population) 
The ARR for the placebo + IFN-β group and cladribine 3.5 mg/kg + IFN-β group were 0.32 and 0.12, 
respectively. The relative risk of 0.37 (95% CI: 0.22, 0.63) indicates that subjects in the cladribine 
3.5 mg/kg + IFN-β group were 63% less likely to experience a qualifying relapse than subjects in the placebo 
+ IFN-β group (p<0.001). In the SPMS subgroup, the relative risk was 0.11 (95% CI: 0.01, 0.94), indicating 
that subjects in the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg + IFN-β were 89% less likely to experience a qualifying relapse than 
subjects in the placebo + IFN-β group (p=0.0439). For patients in the RRMS subgroup with superimposed 
relapses, the relative risk was 0.50 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.84) in the cladribine over the placebo group, indicating 
that subjects in the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg + IFN-β were 50% less likely to experience a qualifying relapse than 
subjects in the placebo + IFN-β group (p=0.0090). 
Subgroup analyses in SPMS and RRMS patients showed a statistically significant reduction in ARR with active 
treatment compared to placebo in both patient groups (see Table 21).

EDSS 
In the placebo + IFN-β group, 6 (12.5%) of 48 subjects had a qualifying 3-month sustained EDSS disability 
progression compared with 19 (15.3%) of 124 subjects in the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg + IFN-β group 
(p=0.623). Similarly, no treatment effect was observed in either of the SPMS or RRMS subgroups, which is 
consistent with the overall study data and as expected given the low number of patients in the study. 
MRI 
There were 11 MRI efficacy endpoints. Of these, 7 MRI endpoints gave positive efficacy signals in favour of 
the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg + IFN-β group. There was a significant reduction in the mean (SD) number of new 
T1 Gd+ lesions per subject per scan during the 96 week double-blind period in the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg + 
IFN-β group (0.25 [1.46]) compared with the placebo + IFN-β group (1.27 [3.39]). For subjects in the SPMS 
subgroup, cladribine 3.5 mg/kg + IFN-β led to a reduction in both mean (SD) number of T1 Gd+ lesions 
(0.13±0.55) and mean number of active T2 lesions (0.29±0.52) per subject per scan compared to placebo + 
IFN-β (0.67±2.00 and 0.59±1.66 respectively). For subjects in the RRMS subgroup with superimposed 
relapses, cladribine 3.5 mg/kg + IFN-β showed superiority as well in reducing the mean (SD) number of T1 
Gd+ (0.05±0.31) and T2 lesions (0.58±1.40) per subject per scan compared to placebo + IFN-β (0.29±0.64 
and 1.31±2.36 respectively). 
Clinical study 28821 (ORACLE): A Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-
center clinical trial of oral cladribine in subjects with a first clinical event at high risk of 
converting to MS 
The ORACLE MS study was a Phase III, randomized, double-blind study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
oral doses of cladribine (3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/kg) vs placebo in subjects who had sustained a first clinical 
demyelinating event within 75 days prior to the screening visit. The study was terminated early in June 2011 
(protocol amendment 5).  
Subjects  were  randomized  to  either  oral  cladribine  5.25  mg/kg,  oral  cladribine  3.5  mg/kg,  or  matching 
placebo administered following the same course regime as in CLARITY. The treatment was administered over 
a  total  of  6  weeks,  at  the  start  of  Year  1  (4  weeks  of  treatment)  and  Year  2  (2  weeks  of  treatment).  This 
period was referred to as initial treatment period (96 weeks). 
The  primary  objective  was  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  oral  cladribine  on  the  time  to  conversion  from  CIS  to 
clinically definite MS (CDMS, defined according to the Poser criteria by either a second attack or an increase 
in the EDSS score of ≥ 1 point if baseline was ≥1 and ≤ 4.5, or of ≥ 1.5 points if baseline EDSS was 0, or of 
≥  0.5  point  if  baseline  EDSS  was  ≥  5,  sustained  over  a  period  of  at  least  3  months).  CIS  status  was 
confirmed  prior  to  randomisation  by  an  adjudication  committee  applying  the  same  standards  in  all  regions. 
Subjects converting to CDMS within the initial treatment period were to discontinue blinded study medication 
at the time of conversion to CDMS and initiate maintenance treatment with INF-ß in an open-label fashion for 
96 weeks.  
Subjects  who  did  not  convert  to  CDMS  during  the  initial  treatment  period  were  eligible  to  enroll  in  a  long-
term follow-up (LTFU) period. Subjects who developed MS according to the McDonald 2005 criteria received 
open-label cladribine 3.5 mg/kg upon entry into the LTFU. Subjects without signs of MS did not receive any 
treatment. After protocol amendment 5, subjects who converted to either MS diagnosis in the LTFU were to 
receive INF-ß. The original duration of the LTFU period was planned as a maximum of 96 weeks. Upon early 
termination  of  the  study,  the  period  was  reduced  to  allow  for  follow-up  of  subjects  for  24  weeks  from  the 
time of the last dose of cladribine.  
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017

A total of 617 subjects were randomized and 616 received at least 1 dose of blinded study medication (the 
ITT/Safety  Population);  204  subjects  in  the  cladribine  5.25  mg/kg group,  206  subjects in  the  cladribine  3.5 
mg/kg group, and 206 subjects in the placebo group. 
Results 
Main patient demographics and baseline characteristics were balanced across treatment groups, except for a 
higher proportion of subjects with T1 lesions in the cladribine 5.25 mg/kg group. It also appeared that more 
severe cases of CIS were recruited in Russia/Eastern Europe. 
Primary Endpoint - Conversion to CDMS 
At the time of protocol amendment 5, which required subjects to discontinue cladribine treatment, only 6.8% 
of subjects had discontinued early from the initial treatment period. At the time of the primary analysis of the 
initial treatment period, a total of 122 subjects in the ORACLE MS study had converted to CDMS (122/127 
[96.1%] of the planned number of events). Of the 122 subjects who converted to CDMS, 27 subjects had 
been treated with cladribine 3.5 mg/kg, 30 subjects had been treated with cladribine 5.25 mg/kg, and the 
remaining 65 subjects had been treated with placebo.  
Treatment with cladribine 3.5 mg/kg and cladribine 5.25 mg/kg delayed the time to CDMS conversion 
compared to placebo (p<0.0001 for each comparison) during the initial treatment period. The estimated HR 
for CDMS conversion was 0.354 (95% CI: 0.226, 0.555; p<0.0001) for the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg group vs the 
placebo group, indicating a 64.6% risk reduction of CDMS conversion relative to the placebo group. The 
estimated HR for the time to CDMS conversion was 0.414 (95% CI: 0.269, 0.639; p<0.0001) for the 
cladribine 5.25 mg/kg group vs the placebo group, indicating a 58.6% risk reduction of CDMS conversion in 
the cladribine 5.25 mg/kg group relative to the placebo group. 
The Kaplan-Meier estimates of the cumulative probability of CDMS conversion at the end of the double-blind 
period in the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg, cladribine 5.25 mg/kg, and placebo groups were 15.8%, 18.1%, and 
40.1%, respectively (see Figure 8).

The number and percentage of subjects in the ITT analysis set who satisfied the 2010 McDonald MS Criteria 
at baseline were 83 (40.7%) subjects in the cladribine 5.25 mg/kg group, 68 (33.0%) subjects in the 
cladribine 3.5 mg/kg group, and 72 (35.0%) subjects in the placebo group. For these subjects, there was a 
significant difference in favour of the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg group compared with the placebo in the time to 
CDMS conversion during the initial treatment phase. The HR was 0.258 (95% CI 0.116, 0.575; p=0.0009), 
indicating a 74.2% risk reduction of CDMS conversion compared to placebo. Although the HR for cladribine 
5.25 mg/kg versus placebo (0.628) was favourable for active treatment, it did not reach statistical 
significance (p=0.1364). 
2.5.5.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Efficacy data from four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II/III studies have been provided 
in support of the application for cladribine, covering a relatively broad spectrum of MS patients. Patients with 
RRMS were recruited in the pivotal Phase III study CLARITY along with its 2-year extension CLARITY EXT. 
While CLARITY mostly enrolled RRMS patients with low disease activity, the study also included a limited 
subset of patients with highly active RRMS, in line with the proposed target population. Supportive data were 
furthermore available in patients with SPMS and superimposed relapses, which were recruited in addition to 
RRMS patients in the ONWARD study. The use of cladribine was also evaluated in patients with CIS in the 
ORACLE study. Finally, additional data from the Scripps legacy studies were provided with parenteral 
cladribine. These studies were considered mainly in the context of the dose selection for the clinical trials with 
oral cladribine. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
All four clinical trials evaluated two cumulative doses of oral cladribine, 3.5mg/kg and 5.25 mg/kg. The 
choice of the doses was based on a number of small phase II studies (the Scripps studies) using parenteral 
cladribine and taking into account the bioavailability of cladribine after p.o. administration. 
CLARITY 
In CLARITY, RRMS patients were included in accordance with the McDonald’s 2005 criteria. The total 
treatment period was 96 weeks, whereby active treatment was administered at the beginning of Year 1 and 2 
in monthly courses of 0.875 mg/kg up to a cumulative dose of 3.5mg/kg and 5.25 mg/kg. The overall design 
of the study was considered acceptable. 
The primary objective was to evaluate the efficacy of cladribine versus placebo in the reduction of the 
annualized qualifying relapse rate (ARR) at the end of the treatment period compared to baseline, which is in 
line with the CHMP Guideline on clinical investigations of medicinal products for the treatment of Multiple 
Sclerosis (EMA/CHMP/771815/2011, Rev. 2). According to the Guideline, progression of disability should be a 
key secondary endpoint, and was investigated in CLARITY as time to sustained change in EDSS over a period 
of at least 3 months, although only as a regular secondary endpoint. Disease progression over a period of 6 
months was investigated in a post-hoc analysis, which was considered acceptable given that the study was 
conducted prior to the specification of the duration in the Guideline. The CHMP furthermore noted that the 
Guideline requires clinical global impression of change as well as patient reported outcomes to be included as 
secondary endpoints, which was not the case in CLARITY. However, as the tertiary endpoints included 
measurements to this end (e.g. health related quality of life [HRQL] and health care resource utilisation 
[HRU]), this was considered a minor issue.  
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 80/131 
  
  
For the statistical analyses, an ANOVA model with fixed effects for treatment group and region using a Chi-
square test based on Wald statistics was used, which was considered acceptable. The choice of a fixed effect 
model rather than a random effect model was considered acceptable as the study population was limited to 
RRMS patients. For the secondary endpoints, the hierarchical testing procedure as well as the hierarchical 
ranking (T1, T2, and CU) was also considered appropriate.  
In line with a CHMP Scientific Advice in December 2014, in order to identify a target population with a more 
favourable benefit-risk balance, post-hoc subgroup analyses were performed in patients with high disease 
activity (HDA). Four HDA groups were initially defined with high disease activity being measured in terms of 
occurrence of relapse and presence of MRI lesions with or without prior DMD treatment. The criteria defining 
the HDA4 subgroup of patients, i.e. at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on DMD therapy and at least 
1 T1 Gd+ lesion or 9 T2 lesions, OR with 2 or more relapses in the previous year (regardless of previous 
treatment status) resulted in the largest subgroups of patients in all three treatment groups. Still, the 
proportion of patients fulfilling this definition was limited.  
CLARITY EXT  
Patients who completed scheduled clinic visits for the full 96 weeks in the CLARITY study were eligible to 
participate in CLARITY EXT. The primary objective of this extension study was to investigate the long-term 
safety of oral cladribine, whereas efficacy was amongst the explorative objectives, which limits firm 
conclusions regarding efficacy.  
Compared to CLARITY, more restrictions related to safety parameters like comorbidities (LTBI and TB) as well 
as threshold blood test values were introduced. The stricter inclusion/exclusion criteria did not negatively 
affect recruitment, whereas it would likely enhance the safety of cladribine in clinical practice for which 
reason they are reflected in the SmPC sections 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 (see also section 2.6. on clinical safety).  
The study included a 96-week double-blind period (divided into two 48-week periods during which treatment 
was given according to the same schedule as in the second year of CLARITY). Five treatment groups were 
investigated: LLPP (3.5 mg/kg during CLARITY, placebo in CLARITY EXT), HLPP (5.25 mg/kg during CLARITY, 
placebo in CLARITY EXT), LLLL (3.5 mg/kg during CLARITY, 3.5 mg/kg in CLARITY EXT), HLLL (5.25 mg/kg 
during CLARITY, 3.5 mg/kg in CLARITY EXT) and PPLL (placebo during CLARITY, 3.5 mg/kg in CLARITY EXT). 
The choice to only use the 3.5 mg/kg dose in CLARITY EXT was considered appropriate as no clinical 
meaningful difference in efficacy between doses had previously been observed in CLARITY (see also 
discussion on efficacy data below). Overall, the design of the study was considered suitable in order to 
examine persistence of the treatment effect and the need for additional treatment cycles in year 3 and 4.   
With regards to the efficacy variables, which included both clinical and MRI endpoints, the CHMP noted that 
an extensive list of MRI parameters had been predefined, which increases the likelihood of chance-findings.  
Supportive studies (ONWARD and ORACLE) 
ONWARD was designed primarily to evaluate safety and tolerability of cladribine as add-on treatment to 
background INF-β treatment in patients with active RMS. The population studied in ONWARD was more 
advanced compared to CLARITY and ORACLE and included RMS patients, who despite treatment with INF-ß 
had at least one relapse during last 12 months. While the majority of patients had RRMS, 14.5% of patients 
recruited into this trial had SPMS with superimposed relapses (16.7% placebo; 13.7% cladribine 3.5mg/kg). 
All efficacy endpoints were secondary and included qualifying relapse rate, progression of disability and lesion 
activity (MRI) and the results were considered supportive for the present application. Moreover, although the 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 81/131 
  
  
number of SPMS patients was low, subgroup analyses were considered relevant to support efficacy of 
cladribine in this population.  
ORACLE was designed to test the efficacy of cladribine in preventing conversion of CIS to CDMS. Notably, 
some CIS patients (approximately 30%) could be retrospectively classified as RMS based on the 2010 
McDonald criteria. The population tested in the ORACLE study was considered to be representative of patients 
with very early stage in the disease development. More severe cases of CIS were recruited in Russia/Eastern 
Europe, but this was not regarded as a major issue, given that the present application concerns a different 
target population (RRMS patients with high disease activity). The study was prematurely terminated 
collecting 122 instead of 127 conversion to CDMS cases and resulting in changes to patient follow up. While 
the shorter follow up may have had an impact on the study results, it was considered unlikely that the 
deviation from the originally planned conversion rate had an impact on the primary efficacy results. 
Pooled analysis 
In order to increase the number of patients for the evaluation of long term efficacy of cladribine treatment, 
data from CLARITY, CLARITY EXT, and ONWARD were pooled. The main focus was on the 96 Week DB cohort 
including data from the double-blind period of CLARITY and ONWARD. However, while the advantages of a 
larger analysis population were acknowledged, the value of a pooled analysis in a heterogeneous patient 
population as the one resulting from the combination of CLARITY and ORACLE could be questioned. ONWARD 
compared cladribine + IFN-β to placebo + IFN-β, whereby the effect of INF-β in the treatment in RRMS is 
well established. This means that efficacy seen in ORACLE (both in the active and the placebo arm) cannot be 
solely attributed to cladribine. Further, a small subset of subjects in ONWARD was classified as SPMS 
(14.5%) with superimposed relapses. On the other hand, it could be expected that in order to demonstrate 
efficacy on ARR, EDSS and MRI endpoints in a more heterogeneous patient population could actually be more 
challenging. With that said, patients included into CLARITY, CLARITY EXT and ONWARD were considered an 
adequate group to study efficacy of cladribine in RRMS (as well as RMS) and data pooling helped to increase 
the size of the HDA analysis population. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
CLARITY 
A total of 1,326 patients were randomised into one of the treatment groups in CLARITY. Of these, 87.9% 
patients completed treatment and 89.3% completed the study, and the rates were comparable across 
treatment groups. In both cladribine groups, the most common reason for discontinuation of treatment was 
adverse events (AEs), whereas in the placebo-group the most common reason for discontinuation was 
disease progression (5.5%). Baseline demographics as well as MRI and neurological findings were generally 
well balanced across treatment groups, although T1 hypointense and T2 lesion load appeared to be greater in 
the cladribine 5.25 mg/kg group, suggesting that patients in this group may have had an increased disease 
burden at baseline. 
The primary endpoint was met for both doses of cladribine. The ARRs were 0.15 for patients receiving 
cladribine 5.25 mg/kg, 0.14 for patients receiving cladribine 3.5 mg/kg, and 0.33 for the placebo group. The 
difference between both active arms and placebo was statistically significant (p<0.001) and of clinically 
relevance with a relative reduction of the ARR of 54.5% with cladribine 5.25 mg/kg and 57.6% with 
cladribine 3.5 mg/kg compared to placebo. No difference in the effect size was observed between the 2 
cladribine doses, which supports the choice of the 3.5mg/kg dose for use in CLARITY EXT as well as in clinical 
practice. In general, the RRMS patients recruited in CLARITY were relatively mildly affected, which is reflected 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 82/131 
  
  
in the low ARR in the placebo group, which was in fact somewhat lower compared to the ARR in the placebo 
group of clinical trials with recently approved MS treatments.  
With regards to the time to 3-months sustained disability progression, the hazard ratios were 0.67 and 0.69 
for cladribine 3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/kg respectively versus placebo. The differences between the active 
arms and placebo were statistically significant and were considered clinically relevant, although in absolute 
figures for the 10th percentile, the difference between active treatment and placebo was only 84 days. There 
was no clinically meaningful difference between the two cladribine doses. Time to 6-month sustained change 
in EDSS showed similar results in favour of active treatment with a hazard ratio of 0.53 for cladribine 
3.5 mg/kg and 0.68 for cladribine 5.25 mg/kg (p=0.0016 and p=0.0332, respectively).  
Secondary MRI endpoints included the mean number of active T1 Gd+-enhanced lesions per subject per 
scan, mean number of active T2 lesions per subject per scan and mean number of CU lesions per subject per 
scan. For all imaging endpoints, a statistically significant difference between active treatment and placebo 
was found (p<0.001 for all comparisons). Yet again, no relevant difference between the cladribine doses was 
observed. Results for the tertiary endpoints supported the findings for the primary and secondary endpoints.  
CLARITY recruited a total of 32 patients older than 55 years (but less than 65 years). Recently, it was shown 
that natalizumab is more effective in younger patients compared to older ones (Matell et al., 2015). Given 
that cladribine, like natalizumab, could also be considered a potent anti-inflammatory treatment, a similar 
age-dependent effect could be possible. In response to a CHMP request, a subgroup analysis of patients aged 
≤50 years (N=1155) compared to patients >50 years (N=171) was performed. Despite higher disease 
activity in younger patients, the analysis showed beneficial effects of cladribine 3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/kg in 
both subgroups in line with the results for the overall study population. The relative risk for a qualifying 
relapse with cladribine 3.5mg/kg compared to placebo was 0.41 for patients ≤50 years (p<0.0001) and 0.48 
for patients >50 years (p=0.0273). 
With regards to high disease activity patients, treatment with cladribine was superior to placebo for all 
efficacy endpoints. With regards to ARR, HDA patients treated with cladribine 3.5 mg/kg had a relapse rate of 
0.16-0.22 compared to 0.47-0.57 in HDA patients treated with placebo. The relative risk ranged from 0.32 to 
0.38 across the 4 defined HDA subgroups. In non-HDA patients the relapse rate was 0.13-0.14 for patients 
receiving cladribine 3.5 mg/kg compared to 0.29-0.30 for placebo. The relative risk was within the range of 
0.43-0.49. These findings support a trend for a greater benefit of cladribine in patients with high disease 
activity. The same pattern was seen for the 5.25 mg/kg dose. A greater effect of cladribine in HDA patients 
compared to non-HDA patients was observed for other endpoints including time to 3 months or 6 months 
disease progression, but not for MRI and NEDA endpoints, where there was no difference. 
Overall, based on the disease activity in the placebo groups across the 4 HDA subgroups, all groups appear to 
have been reasonable defined to identify relevant patients. There were however substantial overlaps in the 
definition of the HDA groups and it was not possible to single out one of the HDA subgroups that improved 
most with cladribine. This was not considered a major issue though in light of the consistent trend of 
increased efficacy seen across all HDA subgroups.    
Overall, the CLARITY study showed a clinically relevant effect of cladribine in the treatment of adult patients 
with RRMS and subgroup analyses support a trend for a greater benefit of cladribine in HDA patients. As no 
additional effect was observed in patients treated with a cumulative cladribine dose of 5.25 mg/kg compared 
to patients receiving cladribine 3.5mg/kg, the lower dose was considered a more appropriate choice for use 
clinical practice. Modelling of the exposure-effect relationship suggested that 3.5 mg/kg was close to the 
minimal effective dose (see section 2.4.3. ). Modelling also supported the proposed duration between two

Page 83/131 
  
  
treatment courses including the proposition that the second dose in year 2 can be delayed up 6 months 
without loss of efficacy.  
CLARITY EXT 
Of the 1184 patients who completed CLARITY, only 883 patients were enrolled into CLARITY EXT. CLARITY 
EXT was not initiated immediately but only after 54% of the patients had completed CLARITY. The most 
frequent reasons for study discontinuation were patient’s decision, loss to follow-up or AEs. The gap between 
the two studies could explain why not all of the patients completing CLARITY continued in CLARITY EXT and 
could have contributed to the recruitment of a selected patient population. However, there were only few 
differences in the basic demographic characteristics of patients who entered CLARITY EXT and patients who 
never entered the study: patients who never entered CLARITY EXT had longer disease duration and slightly 
higher EDSS at baseline of CLARITY. Furthermore, patients randomised to placebo in CLARITY who never 
entered CLARITY EXT had a higher disease burden at the end of CLARITY, thus making the placebo/low dose 
group appear healthier (PPLL). 
Overall, the baseline demographic characteristics were similar for all treatment groups and resembled the 
baseline demographic characteristics in CLARITY. Notably, baseline EDSS score in the placebo treated 
patients had not changed at the time of entry into the CLARITY EXT study compared to enrolment in CLARITY 
i.e. for two years there was no worsening in disability despite absence of treatment. This again speaks for a 
mildly affected study population. 
Overall, the efficacy results from the study should be interpreted with caution, given the exploratory nature 
of the analyses. However, the majority of clinical efficacy results suggested that there was no relevant added 
benefit of additional treatment courses beyond year 2 and that the treatment effect obtained in CLARITY was 
maintained. Comparison of the ARRs observed in CLARITY and CLARITY EXT as well as across the treatment 
groups in CLARITY EXT showed no clinically meaningful difference for any of the comparisons, with the only 
exception, as expected, for the group of patients switching from placebo in CLARITY to low dose cladribine in 
CLARITY EXT. For these patients the ARR was reduced from 0.33 (at the end of CLARITY) to 0.10, which is in 
the range of the effect observed for the active treatment arms in CLARITY (see above). A similar pattern was 
observed for the proportion of patients who were qualifying relapse free during the CLARITY EXT.  
The gap-interval did not seem to influence the ARR. This adds some support to the possibility of having a six 
months delay in treatment between first and second treatment course, if needed (see clinical safety 
discussion in section 2.6. ).  
No clear pattern in the proportion of subjects with or without 3-month confirmed EDSS progression was 
observed. Numerically fewer patients in the HLPP and the LLLL treatment groups (9.8% and 11.8%, 
respectively) compared to patients in the LLPP treatment group (18.4%) experienced 3-month confirmed 
disease progression. While the comparison between LLPP and LLLL does not support a sustained effect of the 
lower dose of cladribine, the low proportion of patients with disability progression in the HLPP treatment 
group does. A similar pattern was seen for time to 6-month confirmed EDSS progression.  
The MRI endpoints did not unequivocally point in one direction and the interpretation of the results was 
severely hampered by the fact that there were different numbers of MRI scans for the CLARITY and the 
CLARITY EXT studies as well as a considerable proportion of missing data for certain analyses. The mean 
number of T1 Gd+ lesions appeared higher in the LLPP and HLPP groups compared to LLLL, HLLL or PPLL 
groups. Between-group comparisons were nominally significant for the active vs placebo groups (HLLL and 
LLLL, and HLPP and LLPP; p<0.001) as well as the low-dose 192 week vs 96 week treatment groups (LLLL 
and LLPP; p<0.001). In addition, in the LLPP group, mean numbers of new T1 Gd+ lesions were higher 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 84/131 
  
  
among subjects with gap duration >43 weeks than among subjects with gap duration between 4 and 43 
weeks or subjects with gap duration ≤4 weeks. In addition, proportions of subjects with a mean of at least 1 
new T1 Gd+ lesion per scan were higher among subjects with gap duration >43 weeks compared to the other 
subgroups. The inflammatory disease activity in the LLPP and HLPP groups reflected by higher number of 
T1Gd+ lesions might be an early subclinical signal of increasing risk for a relapse, even though it is not yet 
reflected in actual increase of the ARR. However, the need for re-treatment beyond 4 years has not been 
studied and no clear recommendations could be given. The applicant therefore agreed to further investigate 
recurrence of disease activity and the need for re-treatment as secondary objective in the planned long-term 
cohort post-authorisation study (see section 2.7. ). 
The initial increase in active T2 lesions observed in all treatment groups during the first year of CLARITY EXT 
can possibly be explained by the effect of the gap between studies and the dissemination in time of the 
disease however, even in the active treatment groups (LLLL and HLLL), the level from the CLARITY study was 
not reached by the end of CLARITY EXT. The Applicant suggested that the increase was driven by patients 
who entered CLARITY EXT as outliers in terms of disease activity as measured by MRI.  While not entirely 
convincing as a sole explanation, the outlier hypothesis may explain the finding to some extent. 
With regards to patients with high disease activity, the Applicant presented post hoc analyses for LLPP 
patients (patients receiving 3.5 mg/kg in CLARITY followed by placebo in CLARITY EXT). For LLPP patients, 
the ARR in the extension study remained low on average and similar to that seen on active treatment in 
CLARITY, whereas the mean number of active T2 lesions was as high as in the CLARITY placebo group. There 
were no meaningful differences in the ARR, T1 Gd+ lesions, or active T2 lesions during CLARITY EXT between 
LLPP patients fulfilling either HDA or non-HDA definitions.  
ONWARD 
In the placebo + IFN-β group, the mean (SD) number of qualifying relapses was 0.56 (0.90) compared with 
0.23 (0.53) relapses in the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg + IFN-β group. The CHMP noted that the ARR in the placebo 
+IFN-β group was similar to ARRs reported previously for different IFN-β products. Other secondary efficacy 
endpoints also consistently showed superior efficacy of add-on cladribine treatment compared to IFN-β 
treatment alone. However, no difference in the effect on disability progression between treatment groups was 
observed. Given the small number of patients and events and that the study was not designed for a formal 
proof of efficacy, it is possible that the study was not adequately powered for the efficacy evaluations. 
Although the low number of SPMS patients with superimposed relapses limits interpretation, subgroup 
analyses indicate a similar treatment effect in terms of relapse reduction with cladribine in both RRMS and 
SPMS patients with superimposed relapses. To further strengthen these results, analyses of the combined 
CLARITY + ONWARD patient population using baseline EDSS ≥ 3.5 as a proxy for SPMS (or high risk of 
transitioning to SPMS) was performed and there were no meaningful differences when comparing patients 
who entered the study with a baseline EDSS ≥ 3.5 and the complementary subgroup (EDSS ≤ 3). The ARR 
risk ratio was 0.40 in the EDSS ≤ 3 subgroup compared to 0.47 in the EDSS ≥ 3.5 subgroup. Based on these 
results and in order to keep consistency with recently approved MS DMDs as well as the Guideline on clinical 
investigation of medicinal products for the treatment of Multiple Sclerosis (EMA/CHMP/771815/2011, Rev. 2), 
which states that it is reasonable to assume that relapses in RRMS and SPMS have the same underlying 
inflammatory pathophysiology and therefore efficacy on relapses in RRMS patients may be extrapolated to 
efficacy on relapses in SPMS, the CHMP was of the view that are more appropriate target population for 
cladribine would be patients with highly active RMS instead of RRMS.

ORACLE 
Both cladribine doses tested (3.5mg/kg and 5.25 mg/kg) demonstrated superiority over placebo in 
conversion from CIS to CDMS in ORACLE study. The results for secondary endpoints were consistent with the 
primary efficacy analysis. The results of ORACLE, including the post-hoc analysis for the subgroup of patients 
retrospectively identified to fulfil the 2010 McDonald criteria were considered supportive. 
Pooled analysis 
Despite the heterogeneity of the combined study population from CLARITY and ONWARD, the pooled analysis 
showed almost identical efficacy results for the primary and secondary endpoints as in the CLARITY study 
including the analysis for HDA patients.   
Efficacy data were also compared for subgroups by baseline characteristics including number of relapses 
(no relapses versus ≥1 relapses), T1 Gd+ lesion counts (no T1 Gd+ versus ≥1 T1 Gd+), T2 lesion number 
(<9 T2 versus ≥ 9 T2), prior use of DMD, sex, age (≤40 versus >40 years old), EDSS (≤3 vs >3) and found 
no differences for most of parameters compared, except for an age effect on time to 3 month confirmed 
EDSS progression (worse effect in older than 40 years patients for cladribine 3.5mg/kg, interaction 
p=0.0422). However, the interaction of age was not reproduced in the cladribine 5.25 mg/kg versus placebo 
comparison. Given the multiplicity of the analyses, the observed age effect might be a chance finding. 
Further, some analyses (3 month confirmed EDSS progression as well as MRI endpoints) showed a better 
effect in males compared to females. The applicant explained that the mean numbers of T1 Gd+ lesions per 
patient per scan as well as the cumulative number of active T2 lesions during the 96-weeks of 
CLARITY+ONWARD was higher in males compared to females on placebo, which could to some extent explain 
the observed interaction of gender. Overall, it was considered reassuring that in both males and females a 
treatment benefit of cladribine has been shown. 
The analyses of efficacy for HDA subgroups were in general consistent with the analyses in CLARITY. 
Additional expert consultation 
During the course of the assessment of the present application, the CHMP decided to consult the scientific 
advisory group neurology on a number of questions related to the benefits, risks and the identification of a 
suitable target population for cladribine. The experts advised the following: 
Question 1: What is the SAG members view on the documented effect of cladribine, including the 
effect in the high disease activity (HDA) patient groups as well as the potential benefit associated 
with the posology (2 treatment weeks/year).  
All SAG members agreed that a clear beneficial effect of cladribine in the treatment of (R)RMS has been 
shown. The observed effect size was within the range of other disease modifying treatments (DMTs), 
although it was noted that the patient population recruited in the main study with cladribine (CLARITY) had 
overall rather low disease activity, which was in fact lower than in the patient populations in whom recently 
approved DMTs have been studied. Other limitations of the clinical trial program for cladribine include the 
lack of an active comparator and that the evidence in HDA patients was derived from a post-hoc subgroup 
analysis. Nevertheless, the experts considered the evidence convincing and some members even questioned 
the need for restricting the target population to HDA as cladribine could also be a treatment option in patients 
with mild or moderate disease. However, ultimately the majority of SAG members considered that the choice 
of the target population for cladribine needs to take into account the safety profile and related uncertainties 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 86/131 
  
  
(see also question 3) and that further evidence may be needed in order to support the use in a broader 
population. 
The oral route of administration and the need for very few treatment cycles only were considered a clear 
advantage for patients over most other available treatment options, many of which require frequent 
injections. This view was stressed by the patient representatives, who would welcome a therapeutic option 
with a low treatment burden.  
Question 2: What is the SAG members view on the risk of malignancies with the use of cladribine 
given the observed imbalance between cladribine and placebo in the rate of malignancies and in 
particular solid tumours (All Exposed Cohort), and considering the mechanism of action of 
cladribine? The experts are invited to reflect on all relevant non-clinical, clinical and 
epidemiological data as well as available data for other MS products. 
The SAG discussed the observed imbalance of malignancy cases observed with cladribine compared to 
placebo in the clinical trials program. The argument that the difference was driven by a lower than expected 
incidence rate in the placebo arm was not fully supported as the indirect comparisons with other DMTs and 
epidemiology data (GLOBOCAN) were viewed as problematic. Replication of the analyses performed and 
independent verification of the findings would be reassuring. However, in any event such indirect comparison 
was not considered suitable to fully address the uncertainty arising from a finding based on data from 
prospective, randomised, controlled trials. Another explanation for the low rate of cancers in patients 
receiving placebo could in fact be that the selected study population was generally at a low risk. One expert 
noted that the inclusion of older patients may have contributed to the study findings with regards to 
malignancies and that maybe use in younger patients e.g. aged less than 40 years could be an option. 
However, while among the baseline factors related to cancer risk, age was found to be of relevance, it did not 
explain the observed imbalance between cladribine and placebo (suggesting that cancer risk may generally 
be increased in elder patients). Furthermore, such age cut-off may be difficult to implement in clinical 
practice.  
In any event, the pattern of malignancies in terms of tumour types (including the lack of clear clusters) and 
latency was considered reassuring as it was not in line with what would be expected with a carcinogenic 
substance. The fact that hairy-cell leukaemia patients treated with cladribine seem not to have an increased 
risk of malignancies was also reassuring. Overall, the experts considered other risks with cladribine to be 
equally or even more relevant, in particular the risk of infections. Furthermore, the possibility of women of 
childbearing potential becoming pregnant during treatment with cladribine was a concern. 
Question 3: How do the SAG members perceive the benefits as discussed above, in light of the 
potential risk of malignancies in the treatment of (R)RMS? Taking into account currently available 
treatment options for (R)RMS, is there a suitable target population, including the applicant’s 
proposal for HDA patients, in whom cladribine would be a useful treatment alternative?  
The experts found it difficult to make a judgement where cladribine fits in the therapeutic armamentarium of 
MS treatments. Part of this is due to the fact that the studies were conducted several years ago and the 
therapeutic landscape has changed since. In this sense, the lack of an active comparator was unfortunate as 
it would have helped to put into context the benefits and risks of cladribine. Cladribine seems to have clear 
advantages over some existing treatment options such as the absence of secondary autoimmunity during the 
immune reconstitution phase. It also has a very low treatment and monitoring burden and could be a good 
addition to the range of available MS therapies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 87/131 
  
  
In order to decide on an adequate patient population, the experts felt that the total safety profile including 
the risk of infections should be considered. There was consensus that the benefits of treatment with 
cladribine outweighed the risks in a restricted target population with high disease activity, such as the one 
defined in the post-hoc analyses and proposed by the applicant for inclusion in the SmPC (i.e. subjects with 
at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on DMD therapy and at least 1 T1 Gd+ lesion or 9 T2 lesions, OR 
subjects with 2 or more relapses in the previous year regardless of previous treatment status). However, as 
previously mentioned (see question 1 and 2) there is only data form post-hoc subgroup analyses primarily 
based on a sinlgle randomised controlled trial and uncertainties with regards to safety remained. 
The experts highlighted the need for further data collection in the future and thorough post-marketing 
surveillance, such as safety of switching between cladribine and other DMTs, should the product be approved. 
Clear information on the risks of malignancies and infections should be presented in the product information 
to allow prescribers and patients to make an informed decision.  
2.5.6.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the available clinical efficacy data were considered adequate to support the use of cladribine in the 
treatment of adult patients with highly active RMS as defined by clinical or imaging features.  
Results from the pivotal study CLARITY showed a clinically relevant effect of cladribine in patients with RMS 
in terms of reduction of relapse rate as well as MRI lesions and delay in disability progression. Subgroup 
analyses suggested a larger effect size in patients with high disease activity. Furthermore, data in SPMS 
patients with superimposed relapses, although very limited, supported a beneficial effect of cladribine on the 
relapse rate in this population. Based on these data and since relapses in both SPMS and RRMS patients have 
the same underlying inflammatory pathophysiology, patients with RMS (instead of RRMS) were considered a 
more suitable target population.  
The data furthermore support the use of a cumulative dose of 3.5 mg/kg to be administered in 2 courses 
each for 2 years. Maintenance of the treatment effect in year 3 and 4 was supported by long-term data from 
CLARITY EXT. No clinically relevant added benefit of additional treatment cycles beyond year 2 was evident. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The main support for the clinical safety assessment was derived from data of the oral cladribine clinical 
development program including the 4 clinical phase II/III studies CLARITY, CLARITY EXT, ONWARD and 
ORACLE. In addition, supportive data were provided from the ongoing PREMIERE Registry and the safety 
study RECORD MS. Finally, safety data from the Scripps studies with parenteral cladribine also contributed to 
the overall safety database.

The PREMIERE registry (Prospective observational long-term safety REgistry of Multiple sclerosis patients who 
have participated in cladribine clinical studies PREMIERE) was ongoing at the time of this report and included 
subjects previously enrolled CLARITY, CLARITY EXT, ONWARD and ORACLE (as well as the pantoprazole DDI 
study 27967). For the purpose of this application, interim data were presented based on a data cut-off of 20 
February 2015. 
RECORD MS (Prospective Observational Post-Authorization Safety Study of Cladribine Tablets in Patients with 
Multiple Sclerosis in Australia) was a multicenter prospective single-arm cohort study of subjects diagnosed 
with relapsing forms of MS as per indication in Australian-approved Product Information, and initiating 
treatment with cladribine tablets administered in routine clinical practice. The main purpose of this study was 
to obtain long-term safety data on cladribine tablets in subjects with MS by estimating the frequency of 
serious adverse drug reactions over a period of time, extending beyond cladribine exposure, in a population 
of subjects who had been exposed to cladribine in a routine clinical practice setting. Notably, while cladribine 
was authorized for the treatment of RRMS in Australia (and Russia), the product was subsequently withdrawn 
from the market in these 2 countries. Enrolment in RECORD MS was stopped after a total of 35 subjects had 
been enrolled. 
An integrated data analysis was conducted focussing on 3 analysis cohorts: 
  All Exposed cohort: includes subjects from all Phase II/III studies with follow-up data (CLARITY, CLARITY 
EXT, ONWARD, ORACLE-MS, PREMIERE, Scripps A, Scripps B, Scripps C, MS-Scripps and MS-001) and 
with any formulation of cladribine. This cohort was used to identify potential safety signals for rare events 
and for events beyond 2 years after first treatment dose. . 
  Placebo-controlled Double-blind cohort: includes safety data from the placebo-controlled double-blind 
period of CLARITY, ORACLE MS, Scripps-B, Scripps-C, MS-Scripps (first sequence only), and MS-001 with 
a monotherapy application (oral or parenteral) of cladribine.  
  Monotherapy Oral cohort: includes safety data from all studies that used cladribine as oral monotherapy 
(CLARITY, CLARITY EXT, ORACLE MS and PREMIERE). This was the primary cohort for the safety 
assessment as it includes all the safety data from the target formulation and allows differentiation 
between the dose and the dose durations (ie, 2 years vs 4 years of therapy).   
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 89/131 
  
  
 
All analyses on the integrated clinical database were based on the safety analysis set, including all subjects 
treated at least once with cladribine, placebo, cladribine plus concomitant active therapy (IFN-β), or placebo 
plus concomitant active therapy (IFN-β). 
Safety data were furthermore analysed in a HDA cohort comprising the HDA subgroups from the CLARITY, 
CLARITY EXT, and ONWARD studies. See sections 2.5.2.1. and 2.5.3. for the HDA subgroup definition (Table 
9) and related efficacy analyses. 
Patient exposure 
Of the subjects included in the All Exposed cohort, 1976 subjects received at least one dose of cladribine and 
802 received placebo. Subjects exposed to cladribine were followed over a longer period of time (on average 
4.4 years) compared with placebo (on average 2.3 years), resulting in 8650 patient-years (PY) of treatment 
and follow-up for the cladribine-treated subjects compared to 2361 PYs of treatment and follow-up for the 
subjects on placebo.

* For the 3.5 mg and 5.25 mg/kg re-exposed arms, cumulative dose is computed from date of first treatment; these 
treatment groups include patient time and events from true re-exposure time.  
The patient population for the proposed indication (high disease activity [HDA]) included, depending on the 
definition of HDA cohort, up to 250 patients (see Table 24) who were exposed to the 3.5 mg/kg dose, of 
which 243 were exposed for at least 6 months, 217 for at least 12 months, 150 for at least 2 years and 
10 for at least 5 years.

a For the 5.25 mg/kg re-exposed* arm, cumulative dose is computed from date of first treatment. 
In the Monotherapy Oral cohort (which was as primary data set for the presentation of the safety data) 
median age of subjects who received placebo and those who received cladribine were very similar: 36.6 
years (range, 18 to 64) and 36.5 years (range, 18 to 65), respectively. By age category, the majority of 
patients belonged to the ≤40 years age group (64.7% placebo and 64.1% cladribine) and around two-thirds 
of the subjects were female (66.1% and 66.3%, respectively). The vast majority (96.9% placebo and 97.3% 
cladribine) of patients were white. Mean disease duration at baseline was 8.9(0.4- to 39.5) years for the 
placebo-exposed and 7.9 (0.3 to 42.3) years for the cladribine-exposed patients. Mean EDSS at baseline was 
2.5 for the placebo-exposed and 2.6 for the cladribine-exposed patients. Mean number of T1 Gd+ lesions for 
the placebo and cladribine exposed patients was 0.8 and 1.1 respectively. Mean number of T2 lesions for the 
placebo and cladribine exposed patients was 27.1 and 29.6 respectively. Around 20% of the participants had 
taken DMDs prior to study start, of which almost all had taken first line MS-DMDs. 
Demographics were overall comparable between treatment cohorts and between cladribine and placebo 
groups.  
Adverse events 
Adverse events (AEs) and medical histories in all studies were recoded into Medical Dictionary of Regulatory 
Activities (MedDRA) version 17.1. AE data were based on treatment-emerged adverse events (TEAEs). An AE 
was treatment-emerged in the period of interest (treatment period) if the AE occurred at or after day 1 of the 
period of interest, i.e. those events which were absent prior to treatment, but started during the treatment 
period or whose severity worsened during the treatment period relative to the pre-treatment state. AEs were 
indicated as ‘related’ to treatment if the investigator considered the relationship probable, probable/likely, 
certain, possible, very likely/certain, and missing. It was considered ‘unrelated’ if a relationship to study drug 
was judged as unlikely, doubtful, unlikely/doubtful, unrelated, not related and none. 
Safety data are presented primarily for the Monotherapy Oral cohort with a focus on cladribine 3.5 mg/kg 
proposed for use in clinical practice. The data are supplemented by data from the other cohorts as relevant 
for the assessment. For the identification of adverse reactions for inclusion into the SmPC, the AEs observed 
in the DB Placebo-Controlled cohort have also been considered. Incidence rates were provided as 
Assessment report

observation-adjusted incidence rates by 100PY to account for different duration of observation periods 
between treatment groups. 
An overview of the AEs reported in the Monotherapy Oral cohort is provided in Table 25. TEAEs were 
generally more frequent among the cladribine-treated patients compared to the placebo-treated patients and 
there was a dose-dependent increase in the rate of patients with at least 1 TEAE.

n = number of subjects with events; T = total subject's time on study in years (if a subject has multiple events, the time to 
first event is considered; for a subject with no event the time is censored at the last follow-up time for that subject); Adj-
AE per 100PY = the time adjusted AE incidence rate (number of events occurring in 100-patient years). 
a Preferred term “Multiple sclerosis relapse” was reported in PREMIERE where relapse was not an efficacy endpoint. 
The most frequently occurring AEs belonged to the MedDRA system organ class (SOC) of Blood and 
Lymphatic System Disorders (driven by the preferred term [PT] lymphopenia) and Infections and Infestations 
(including herpes zoster). The most common TEAE in the Monotherapy Oral cohort was headache, which was 
reported in similar incidences in terms of AEs per 100PY in the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg and placebo groups 
(8.71 vs. 8.82, respectively). TEAEs observed more frequently for cladribine 3.5 mg/kg compared to placebo 
(AE rate per 100PY, difference of ≥0.50), presented by frequency in the 3.5 mg/kg cladribine group) were:

herpes zoster (0.83 vs. 0.20) 
lymphocyte count decreased (0.78 vs. 0.10) 
neutropenia (0.80 vs. 0.20) 
For lymphopenia a dose-response relationship was observed. The findings in this cohort were generally 
similar to the findings for the All Exposed and Double-blind Placebo-controlled cohorts. 
AEs that were observed with a higher incidence rate on cladribine compared to placebo in the Placebo-
Controlled Double-Blind cohort and that also show an apparent dose response in the Monotherapy Oral cohort 
included alopecia and rash. The incidence rates in the Placebo-Controlled Double-Blind cohort for alopecia 
were 1.84 on cladribine vs. 1.16 on placebo and in the Monotherapy Oral cohort 0.40 on placebo, 0.60 on 
cladribine 3.5 mg/kg, and 0.97 on cladribine 5.25 mg/kg. A similar trend was seen in the CLARITY trial (1.10 
on placebo, 3.50 on cladribine 3.5 mg/kg, and 3.10 on cladribine 5.25 mg/kg). Incidence rates of 2.09 on 
cladribine vs. 1.34 on placebo were observed for events of rash in the Placebo-Controlled Double-Blind 
cohort. In the Monotherapy Oral cohort, rash occurred with an incidence of 0.45 on placebo, 0.60 on 
cladribine 3.5 mg/kg, and 0.75 on cladribine 5.25 mg/kg. In CLARITY, a similar trend was seen (1.1 on 
placebo, 2.3 on cladribine 3.5 mg/kg, and 2.4 on cladribine 5.25 mg/kg). Evaluation of the latency between 
first cladribine use and the first onset of the AE revealed that in approximately one third of the patients, rash 
occurred within the first 3 months of cladribine treatment.  
High disease activity (HDA) 
With regards to HDA patients, across the subgroups, lymphopenia was consistently reported at higher 
frequency rates (Adj-AE per 100 PY) compared to placebo.  
A comparison between HDA4 and non-HDA4 patients (which constituted the largest HDA subgroup and 
comprised all patients of the other 3 HDA subgroups) showed no major difference in the AE profile. With 
regard to SAEs, the total incidence rate was higher in the HDA4 subgroup (6.63) compared with the non-
HDA4 subgroup (4.22) but by PT, no particular pattern of SAEs could be identified. The incidence rate of 
lymphopenia was similar between the cladribine HDA4 (10.77) and non-HDA4 (11.89) subgroups. The 
incidence rate of the SOC Infections and Infestations was also similar between the cladribine HDA4 (31.03) 
and non-HDA4 (29.37) subgroups, as well as the corresponding placebo subgroups (31.53 versus 30.44). 
The incidence rate of the SOC Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified was 1.06 in cladribine HDA4 and 
1.76 in the corresponding non-HDA4.  
Abdominal pain upper, constipation, nausea, fall, arthralgia, back pain, musculoskeletal pain, and pain in 
extremity were reported at a slightly higher incidence rate in cladribine HDA4 compared to non-HDA4. 
However, the same trend was seen when comparing the placebo HDA4 and non-HDA4 subgroups. The 
incidence rate for asthenia was also slightly higher in cladribine HDA4 compared to cladribine non-HDA4, 
however the cladribine incidence rates as well as the placebo HDA4 incidence rate were lower than the 
placebo non-HDA4 incidence rate, indicating that the asthenia findings are most likely due to chance. For 
alopecia, a higher incidence rate was seen in cladribine HDA4 compared to non-HDA4, with the same trend 
being seen in the placebo groups.

AEs by severity and relatedness 
The majority of TEAEs in the Monotherapy Oral cohort were mild or moderate in severity. Severe 
lymphopenia was the only severe AE that occurred more frequently (difference ≥0.5 AE per 100PY) on 
cladribine 3.5 mg/kg than on placebo (0.59 vs. 0.00).  
Overall, most TEAEs that were considered to be possibly/probably related to treatment occurred at an 
observed Adj-AE per 100PY rate of <0.10. Of these frequently reported related TEAEs, 5 were identified as 
occurring with a higher observed Adj-AE per 100PY rate in the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/kg groups 
compared to subjects receiving only placebo (Adj-AE per 100PY for: placebo vs 3.5 mg/kg vs 5.25 mg/kg, 
respectively):  
• 
• 
• 
Lymphopenia: 0.65 vs 7.38 vs 12.31 
Leukopenia: 0.35 vs 1.25 vs 2.07 
Lymphocyte count decreased: 0.05 vs 0.66 vs 1.26 
•  Neutropenia: 0.10 vs 0.65 vs 0.71 
•  Herpes zoster: 0.10 vs 0.62 vs 0.66 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs) 
Three main categories of AESIs were defined for the clinical program: (i) Severe (≥Grade 3) sustained 
lymphopenia (expected event based on the mechanism of action of cladribine), (ii) infections (as a result of 
the impaired cell-mediated immunity), and (iii) malignancies. 
•  Severe lymphopenia (Grade ≥3) 
Overall, the incidence rate of lymphopenia  AEs was higher in each pooled cohort of cladribine-exposed 
subjects compared with placebo. Furthermore, the incidence rate of severe lymphopenia AEs in the 
3.5 mg/kg cladribine group was lower than that in the 5.25 mg/kg group (Adj-AESI per 100PY of 0.72 vs 
1.07 respectively, Monotherapy Oral cohort). Similarly, the incidence rate of lymphopenia AEs that led to 
treatment discontinuation was higher in each cohort of cladribine-exposed subjects compared with placebo 
and lower in the 3.5 mg/kg treatment group than that in the 5.25 mg/kg dose treatment group. Re-exposure 
in Years 3 and 4 was associated with an increase in the incidence rates of lymphopenia AEs (Adj-AESI per 
100PY of 1.94 in the cladribine 3.5mg/kg re-exposed group and 1.82 in the cladribine 5.25 mg/kg re-exposed 
group). 
Lymphopenia was consistently dose-dependent across the clinical program of oral cladribine: in CLARITY, 
Grade ≥3 lymphopenia occurred in 110 (25.6%) and 204 (44.9%) of subjects in 3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/kg 
dose groups, respectively; in ORACLE MS, Grade ≥3 lymphopenia occurred in 46 (22.3%) and 74 (36.5%) of 
subjects receiving 3.5 mg/kg or 5.25 mg/kg, respectively; and in patients treated according to the original 
protocol of ONWARD, Grade ≥3 lymphopenia occurred in 12 (75%) and 15 (88.2%) of subjects in the 
3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/kg dose groups, respectively. Notably, higher incidences of Grade ≥3 lymphopenia 
were observed when cladribine was given with concomitant IFN-β treatment in ONWARD compared to 
monotherapy in CLARITY. 
Grade 4 lymphopenia was infrequent throughout the clinical program. In CLARITY, Grade 4 lymphopenia 
occurred in only 3 subjects (0.7%) treated with oral cladribine at 3.5 mg/kg and in 13 subjects (2.9%) 
treated at 5.25 mg/kg. In the CLARITY EXT study in the LLPP group (cladribine 3.5 mg/kg over 2 years, 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 96/131 
  
  
followed by no treatment in the 2 years of EXT) no subjects had Grade 4 lymphopenia and 5 (5.1%) had 
Grade 3 at some time during the CLARITY EXT study.  
In CLARITY, median total lymphocyte counts reached a nadir at Week 16, in both the 3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 
mg/kg cladribine treatment groups; and the counts were lower at the cladribine 5.25 mg/kg dose 
(0.7 x 109/L) than at the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg dose (1.1 x 109/L). After re-treatment at Weeks 48 and 52, 
the nadirs of median total lymphocyte counts were observed at Week 55 (ie, 8 weeks after restarting 
cladribine in Year 2) and were lower than after initial treatment (0.6 x 109/L for cladribine 5.25 mg/kg and 
0.8 x 109/L for cladribine 3.5 mg/kg). At the first nadir (Week 16) following start of treatment in year 1, and 
the second nadir (Week 55) following start of treatment in year 2 (Week 8 after treatment at Week 48), the 
median lymphocyte counts decreased by 42% and 58%, respectively, from baseline pre-treatment levels in 
the oral cladribine 3.5 mg/kg group. The median durations of these Grade 3 or 4 lymphopenias were 23.4 
weeks (5.4 months) and 24.1 weeks (5.6 months), respectively, for the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg and cladribine 
5.25 mg/kg groups in CLARITY. 
At the end of the CLARITY study, 8 (0.9%) subjects in the 3.5 mg/kg group and 21 (2.4%) subjects in the 
5.25 mg/kg group  had Grade ≥3 lymphopenia. Further follow-up of these subjects showed that all those who 
received the 3.5 mg/kg dose eventually recovered to a lymphocyte count Grade 0 or 1. Results from the 
CLARITY and CLARITY EXT trials showed that even in subjects treated for more than 4 years with cladribine 
(cumulative dose of 7 mg/kg) the recovery to Grade 0 or 1 by the end of each treatment year occurred in the 
majority of patients (aproximately 86% of subjects), provided that their baseline lymphocyte counts were 
Grade 0 at baseline of year 1 and Grade 0 or 1 at each of the subsequent yearly treatment courses. The 
incidence of Grade ≥3 lymphopenia was lower at the end of the treatment years, if subjects were treated 
with cladribine 3.5 mg/kg only if they had a baseline lymphocyte count of Grade 0 in year 1 and of Grade 0 
to Grade 1 in year 2 (0.5% and 0.8% respectively), compared to subjects treated when lymphocyte grades 
were ≥1 at baseline of year 1 and Grade ≥2 at year 2 (3.6% and 12.2% respectively). No Grade 4 
lymphopenia was reported at the end of the treatment years in either group. 
Furthermore, in the ONWARD study (cladribine + IFN-β) after implementation of the amended protocol 
including the introduction of lymphocyte-based (re-)treatment guidelines (patients to have a normal ALC 
before initiation of cladribine treatment in year 1 and an ALC which is within the normal range or not worse 
than Grade 1 before treatment in year 2) and the discontinuation of the 5.25 mg/kg cladribine dose, only 2 
(1.6%) subjects in the 3.5 mg/kg cladribine group had Grade 4 lymphopenia. In comparison, under the 
original protocol, 2 subjects (12.5%) in the 3.5 mg/kg cladribine dose group and 3 subjects (17.5%) in the 
5.25 mg/kg cladribine dose group had Grade 4 lymphopenia. Furthermore, with the (re-)treatment criteria in 
place, at the end of year 1, only 1 (0.6%) subject had a Grade 3 lymphopenia, and at the end of year 2, only 
1 (1.2%) subject had Grade 3 lymphopenia. No subjects had Grade 4 lymphopenia at the end of either year. 
Post-hoc analyses performed on the lymphopenia data from the ORACLE MS study, in which treatment 
guidelines were applied throughout the study showed that the duration of Grade ≥3 lymphopenia in subjects 
treated with 3.5 mg/kg cladribine was shorter (median of 3.0 and 3.7 months, respectively, for the first and 
last episodes of Grade 3 or Grade 4 lymphopenia) than in CLARITY where the treatment guidelines were not 
applied. Furthermore, Grade 4 lymphopenia was limited to 3 subjects (1 subject [0.4%] in the cladribine 
3.5 mg/kg group and 2 subjects [1.0%] in the cladribine 5.25 mg/kg group). 
To support the re-treatment scheme, modeling and simulation analysis on the severity and duration of 
lymphopenia in cladribine-treated subjects were performed to gather further evidence on the best re-
treatment strategy for cladribine (see section 2.4.3. ). From the developed model, inferences about the time 
for return to a given lymphopenia grade from a certain ALC nadir could be made. The simulations showed 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 97/131 
  
  
that the proposed (re-)treatment guidelines applied to the use of cladribine at a cumulative dose of 
3.5 mg/kg as the proposed dosing scheme, resulted in shorter lymphopenia recovery time, a lower incidence 
of Grade 3 lymphopenia. Modeling and simulation analyses support the postponement of cladribine treatment 
in year 2 for 6 months. 
No effect on ALC measurements was seen when subjects had received concomitant glucocorticoids, but 
measurements associated with IFN-β-1a treatment (rescue therapy, as defined by the ORACLE MS protocol, 
for patients converting to clinically definite MS) were found to be approximately 19% lower than in the 
absence of IFN-β-1a treatment (p≤0.01). No effect of HDA on the ALC time-course could be identified in the 
covariate analysis. 
• 
Infections 
Incidende rates of the most common infections were similar between the placebo and the cladribine-exposed 
groups with the exception of herpes zoster (adj-AE per 100PY in the Monotherapy Oral cohort was 0.83 for 
cladribine 3.5 mg/kg and 0.20 for placebo) including severe cases (0.09 and 0.05, respectively.) The 
incidence of severe infections was generally higher among the cladribine-treated patients as compared to 
placebo albeit the absolute numbers were low (adj-AE per 100PY: 1.25 vs. 1.08, All Exposed cohort). Serious 
infections also occurred more frequently in the cladribine group compared to placebo (adj-AE per 100PY: 
0.94 vs. 0.64, All Exposed cohort)

cladribine 5.25 mg/kg, the respectve rates were 2.01 per 100 PY (with Grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia) and 0.756 
(without Grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia). 
Regarding opportunistic infections, a customized MedDRA query was used including tuberculosis, and 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). There was no evidence for an increased risk in subjects 
treated with cladribine, although for lymphopenic patients, the incidence was higher as compared to those 
without. In the Monotherapy Oral cohort, adj-AE per 100 PY were as follows: cladribine 3.5 mg/kg with 
lymphopenia (1.72 Adj-AE per 100PY); cladribine 3.5 mg/kg without lymphopenia (1.03 Adj-AE per 100PY); 
cladribine 5.25 mg/kg with lymphopenia (1.72 Adj-AE per 100PY); and cladribine 5.25 mg/kg without 
lymphopenia (0.86 Adj-AE per 100PY). 
In clinical trials of both oral and parenteral cladribine in MS, no PML cases have been reported during a total 
observation period of more than 8500 PYs. However, some cases have been reported with parenteral 
cladribine in lymphoma patients.  
Three cases of tuberculosis were reported in subjects exposed to cladribine (one case each in CLARITY 
[actual dose 0.84mg/kg], CLARITY EXT [assigned dose 8.75mg/kg], and PREMIERE assigned dose 
3.5mg/kg]). The case in CLARITY was fatal. All cases were reported prior to the implementation of the pre-
screening for tuberculosis in the study protocols. 
There were two case of hepatitis B. One subject, tested negative for hepatitis B prior to study entry, was 
diagnosed with hepatitis B on Study Day 43 and died from hepatitis B on Study Day 49. The event was 
considered unrelated to study treatment. 
•  Malignancies 
In general, malignancy rates were higher among the cladribine-treated patients as compared to placebo.  
As Table 28 displays, after adjudication, 37 cases of malignancies reported in 35 subjects across the 
cladribine clinical program were reported across the cladribine clinical program. Of these, 33 occurred under 
cladribine treatment (in 32 patients) and 4 with placebo. The majority of subjects were between 40 and 59 
years old. The types of malignancies seen in cladribine-treated subjects consisted only of solid tumors.  
Overall, there was no obvious pattern or cluster of specific tumour types or locations for either cladribine or 
placebo. There were no cases of leukemia, lymphoma or lymphoproliferative disorders.

In order to compare crude numbers of malignancies in patinets treated with cladribine and placebo, data 
from the 2-year, Phase III, placebo-controlled studies of CLARITY and ORACLE were used. There was a total 
of 5 malignancies reported in 636 patients (0.79%) in the 3.5 mg/kg cladribine group (3 in CLARITY and 2 in 
ORACLE), 2 in 658 patients (0.30%) in the 5.25 mg/kg group (2 in CLARITY and 0 in ORACLE), and 0 in 641 
patients in the placebo group. 
Table 29 provides the results of the comparative analyses for incidence rate ratios (RR) and incidence rate 
differences (RD) comparing cladribine to placebo. The RD for cladribine treatment groups was 0.2457 events 
per 100PY (95%CI: -0.1803; 0.5849) in the Placebo-controlled Double-blind cohort and 0.2033 events per 
100PY (95%CI: -0.0785; 0.3947) in the All Exposed cohort.

Per subject a unique event is a unique PT and date of onset. Total time at risk (T) is the total subject time on study in 
years. If a subject has multiple events, the time to first event is considered. For a subject with no event the time is 
censored at the last follow-up time for that subject.  
a CI is computed with the exact Clopper-Pearson formula.  
b CI is computed with the Wald method for the number of subject with events using a Poisson regression model with fixed 
effect for treatment group and with log of time at risk as an offset.  
c CI is computed using the Miettinen and Nurminen method. 
The risk for NMSC was not increased (RR=1.09). The risk for all skin cancers was only slightly increased 
(RR=1.51). However, analyses of all malignancies excluding non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) in the All 
Exposed cohort showed an RD of 0.19 (95% CI: -0.04; 0.35) and RR of 3.29 (95% CI: 0.78; 13.92). The RR 
of solid tumours excluding all skin cancers was 2.87 (95% CI 0.67; 12.26). 
An analysis of baseline risk factors for cancer in all treatment groups of the cladribine clinical studies was 
perfomed. The only baseline factor showing a prominent effect for all malignancies was age. Patients 
developing malignancies were on average 7 years older than those who did not delvelop malignancies. 
Furthermore, no association between malignancy cases and prior experience of lymphopenia of Grade ≥3, 
was found in an analysis of subjects from the Placebo-controlled Double-blind cohort with an odds ratio of 
1.01 [95% CI: 0.16, 5.19]. 
No dose-relationship was apparent with adj-AEs per 100 PY of 0.37 in the dose range of 0-3.5mg/kg, 0.42 in 
the dose range of >3.5 – 5.25mg/kg, 0.31 in the dose range of > 5.25 – 7.0mg/kg, 0.46 in the dose range of 
> 7.0 – 8.75mg/kg and 0.21 in the dose range of > 8.75mg/kg. 
In an analysis of the cumulative incidence for malignancies over time in the All Exposed cohort, it appears as 
if malignancies occurred sooner among cladribine-treated patients as compared to placebo-treated. By year 2 
on study, 1 malignancy had developed in the placebo group as opposed to 10 malignancies in the cladribine 
group. This trend continues through year 4 by which a total of 2 malignancies in the placebo group have 
developed as opposed to a total of 24 in the cladribine group. By year 6 this tendency is maintained. By the 
final observation, there was a total of 4 patients with malignancies in the placebo group. This is in contrast to 
the 32 patients with malignancies in the cladribine group. Overall, a constant malignancy incidence rate was 
observed for cladribine in Years 1 to 4 and in the period thereafter (incidence per 100PY was 0.38 for each 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 101/131 
  
  
 
 
 
 
period), whereas the incidence rates observed for placebo increased over time (0.10 for year 1-4 and 0.57 
thereafter). 
Comparison with epidemiology data 
To put the malignancy rates in the cladribine integrated safety database into perspective, a comparison with 
the GLOBOCAN (2012) database of malignancies was performed. For this, Standardized Incidence Ratio 
(SIRs) for the overall malignancies in the cladribine and placebo groups were calculated in relation to the 
GLOBOCAN reference population with matched follow-up distribution (with respect to sex, age, and country) 
and estimated by treatment group. NMSCs are not represented in the GLOBOCAN database and were 
therefore not included in this analysis.  
The results of these analyses are summarized in Table 30.

Comparison to Other MS DMDs 
A recent review of the malignancy risk for DMD treatments for MS by an academic group based in the UK 
(Pakpoor et al., 2015) compared published data from 2-year clinical studies. The results of CLARITY, the 
Phase III study of cladribine in RRMS was also included in the analysis. The malignancy rates in the 
treatment and control groups were compared using Fisher's exact test. The authors noted that the 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 102/131 
  
  
 
malignancy rate of cladribine-treated subjects in the CLARITY study (0.34%) was not significantly different 
from all other active treatment groups (0.67%, p=0.3669), see Figure 9.  
Figure 9 - Malignancy Rates for Treatment Groups of DMD MS Drugs in Phase III Trials 
Source: Pakpoor et al., 2015. 
DMD=disease-modifying drug; MS=multiple sclerosis. 
The superscripted numbers against the drug names indicate the publications from which the data are derived. Details of 
these publications are available from the Pakpoor publication (2015) referenced in the source. 
The malignancy rate displayed on the x axis corresponds to the proportion of subjects with relapsing multiple sclerosis in 
whom cancer occurred. 
The fact that no malignancies were observed in the placebo group of CLARITY was unique, and was found to 
be significantly different to the combined cancer rate of all the other placebo groups (1.19%; p=0.0159). The 
authors furthermore compared the RD between cladribine and the other DMDs using random-effects pooling 
and found the RD to be comparable to that of other DMDs. 
Safety after switching from cladribine to other DMDs 
Data from 941 subjects included in the ongoing PREMIERE Registry and previously treated with cladribine 
were analysed. For 33.9% (319/941) of subjects, subsequent DMDs after discontinuation of cladribine 
treatment were recorded: The highest proportions of subjects were treated with IFN-β: 23.0% (216/941), 
followed by glatiramer acetate (9.7%, 91/941). Overall, no specific pattern in the reported SAEs and no 
unexpected safety findings were observed. 
In the ORACLE study, after switching from cladribine to IFN-ß, the safety profile of subjects switching from 
placebo to IFN-ß was similar to that of those who switched from cladribine to IFN-ß, except for a higher rate 
of Grade 2 and 3 lymphopenias in the cladribine group.  
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 103/131 
  
  
 
  
 
 
In the 3.5 mg/group of the CLARITY trial, 11 subjects received rescue treatment with IFN-ß. Review of the 
subject data showed that the AE profiles observed in these subjects after switching from cladribine to IFN-ß 
did not reveal new safety findings compared to the known safety profiles of cladribine and IFN-ß. 
Data from the MSBase (Multiple Sclerosis Database) Foundation included longitudinal clinical data from 
90 cladribine-exposed patients from 55 Australian MS centers in February 2016. These patients had received 
cladribine as part of the Patient Familiarisation Program in 2011. Data were available for 62 patients (69%) 
who were exposed to another DMD following the commencement of the cladribine therapy. Of these, 10 
(11%) experienced 12 AEs during their exposure to these DMDs (annualized rate of 0.09 events per PY) and 
7/12 were evaluated as not being related to DMD. 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) and deaths 
Deaths 
Within All Exposed cohort, there were 24 death cases: 19 were reported for the cladribine-treated subjects 
and 5 for the placebo subjects. All PTs were single reports, with the exception of drowning in 3 cladribine-
treated subjects. 
Of the 24 deaths, 4 were considered related to cladribine treatment including a case of  tuberculosis 
(CLARITY), a case of bile duct adenocarcinoma and lymph node metastases (CLARITY EXT, PPLL group]),  a 
case of pyrexia and herpetic encephalopathy (PREMIERE Registry, cladribine-treatment group in the ONWARD 
study; concurrent fatal SAEs pneumonia and pneumothorax were not considered related) and a case of rectal 
adenocarcinoma (PREMIERE Registry, cladribine-treatment group in the CLARITY study). 
Among the 24 death cases were 4 cases in the SOC of Neoplasms Benign, Malignant and Unspecified 
(including Cysts and Polyps) SOC, all in cladribine-treated subjects: Rectal adenocarcinoma (related), 
pancreatic carcinoma metastatic (unrelated), ovarian cancer (unrelated), bile duct adenocarcinoma and 
metastases to lymph nodes (same subject, both related). There were furthermore 3 cases in the SOC of 
Infections and Infestations: Tuberculosis (cladribine subject, related), hepatitis B (cladribine subject, 
unrelated) and herpetic meningoencephalitis (cladribine subject, related), and 2 cases in the Psychiatric 
Disorders SOC: Completed suicide (placebo subject, unrelated), and intentional self-injury (cladribine subject, 
unrelated). 
The other cases occurred in the General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions SOC (7 deaths, 6 with 
cladribine and 1 with placebo, all unrelated except one case of pyrexia in a cladribine treated subject), the 
Cardiac Disorders SOC (5 deaths, 3 with cladribine, 2 with placebo, all unrelated), the Nervous System 
Disorders SOC (2 deaths, one each with cladribine and placebo, all unrelated), the Injury, Poisoning and 
Procedural Complications SOC (2 deaths, both unrelated and with cladribine), and the Respiratory, Thoracic, 
and Mediastinal Disorders SOC (1 death in a cladribine subject, unrelated). 
There was no difference in the incidence of TEAEs leading to death between the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg group 
and the placebo group: 0.26 Adj-AEs per 100PY were reported for 3.5 mg/kg cladribine-treated subjects and 
0.25 Adj-AEs per 100PY for the patients on placebo. The Adj-AE per 100PY rate of death were similar in 
cladribine and placebo treated patients in the All Exposed cohort (0.22 versus 0.21). In the Placebo-
Controlled Double-Blind Cohort, the Adj-AE per 100 PY (cladribine vs. placebo) were 0.29 versus 0.18 
(corresponding to 7 versus 2 cases).

EMA/435731/2017

Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) 
Overall, one or more SAEs were reported in 13.4% (124/923) of subjects in the 3.5 mg/kg cladribine group, 
11.4% (72/632) of subjects in the 5.25 mg/kg cladribine group and 10.5% (67/641) of subjects in the 
placebo group (Monotherapy Oral Cohort). In addition, 30/195 (15.4%) patients each of the cladribine re-
exposed cohorts experienced SAEs. 
The most frequently occurring SAEs reported were Lymphopenia, Infections and Malignancies (see detailed 
discussion above). Reported SAEs by PT occurring with an AE rate >0.1 in either placebo or cladribine 
3.5 mg/kg treated subjects were blood creatine phosphokinase increased (0.20 vs. 0.21), pneumonia (0.15 
vs. 0.18), uterine leiomyoma (0.10 vs. 0.15), lymphopenia (0 vs. 0.12), and urinary tract infection (0.05 vs. 
0.12). Although the observed incidence rate of serious urinary tract infections was numerically higher in the 
3.5 mg/kg cladribine group when compared to placebo, the incidence rate in the 5.25 mg/kg cladribine group 
was approximately as high as in subjects receiving placebo (0.04 vs. 0.05 AE per 100PY). Overall, the 
incidence rate of urinary tract infections was not elevated in subjects treated with cladribine. 
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory parameters evaluated include routine haematology (haemoglobin, WBC, neutrophils, 
lymphocytes, and platelets), speciality haematology (lymphocyte surface markers), and clinical chemistry 
(creatinine, creatine kinase, bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline 
phosphatase). The lymphocyte surface markers included: CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, CD19+, CD4+:CD8+ ratio, 
CD4+/CD45RO+, CD4+/CD45RA+, CD8+/CD45RO+, and CD8+/CD45RA+. 
Integrated  analysis  based  on  the  Monotherapy  Oral  cohort  indicates  that  cladribine  treatment  resulted  in  a 
decrease  of  WBC  counts,  neutrophils,  and  lymphocytes,  including  CD4+  and  CD8+  T-lymphocytes  and 
CD19+ B-lymphocytes. No meaningful changes were observed in group values for hemoglobin, monocytes or 
eosinophils.  
The median CD4+ counts decreased in the cladribine group after baseline. There was a general tendency for 
the CD4+ counts to recover over time although the median values remained below baseline at Week 240.

Page 105/131 
  
  
Figure 10 - Median (Interquartile Range) CD4 Abs (cells/ μL) Over Time, by Treatment 
(Monotherapy Oral Cohort) 
The median CD8+ counts also decreased in the cladribine group after baseline. There was evidence of 
recovery over time. Recovery appeare dto be faster compared to CD4+. 
With regards to B-cells a rapid decline of CD19+ was observed in the active groups at Week 5. The recovery 
continued over time with the median values at Week 240 close to baseline values. 
Neutrophil count decreased even more rapid than the T cell and B cell count with a slow but recovery towards 
baseline. The WBC count and the platelet count decreased rapidly and did not completely recover to baseline 
values. However, effects on platelets and neutrophils were overall less marked compared to lymphocyte 
markers and most decreases were within normal ranges. Notably, platelet values remained well above levels 
where platelet-deficiency itself posed a haemorrhagic risk. 
For other haematology parameters including red blood cell count, haematocrit values, basophils, and 
eosinophil values, no meaningful changes were detected.  
With regard to clinical chemistry, vital signs, ECG or physical findings, there were no major findings regarded 
as a safety issue.

Safety in special populations 
Age, Gender, Ethnicity and Weight 
No patients older than 65 years were enrolled in the clinical studies in the cladribine development program. 
Age categories of ≤25 years, 26-45 years, 46-55 years and ≥56 years were analysed. The majority of study 
subjects were 26-45 years. Overall, for most AEs a tendency towards increased frequency with increasing 
age was evident. In particular, the rate of lymphopenia was much higher in older people and there was a 
consistent increase with increasing age (Adj-AE per PY in cladribine treated patients: 7.75 for ≤25 years, 
10.75 for 26-45 years, 12.72 for 46-55 years and 22.53 for ≥56 years). When looking at Grade 3 or 4 
lymphopenia the same pattern is observed. However, when looking at cladribine 3.5 mg/kg only 
(Monotherapy Oral Cohort), no difference in the incidence of lymphopenia was observed between patients 
≤ 50 and patients > 50 years of age. 
No studies have been conducted with cladribine in the paediatric population. A product-specific PIP waiver 
has been granted for MS for all subsets of the paediatric population from birth to less than 18 years of age on 
the grounds that the specific medicinal product is likely to be unsafe. 
No major differences between female and male subjects were evident. 
The majority of subjects were white in the placebo (777 out of 802, 96.8%) and cladribine (1906 out of 1976 
subjects, 96.5%) groups making it difficult to draw any meaningful conclusions from the data on other 
ethnicities. 
There were no apparent differences with regard to frequency of AEs by weight category (≤60 kg; >60 to ≤80 
kg; and ≥80 kg). 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
No specific studies have been conducted in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.  
Pregnancy and lactation 
In total, 38 patients treated with cladribine experienced 44 pregnancies while 19 patients treated with 
placebo experienced 20 pregnancies. In the cladribine group, 41% of pregnancies resulted in live births while 
the corresponding proportion was 45% in the placebo group. Induced, spontaneous and medically indicated 
abortion accounted for 32%, 20% and 7% of pregnancies in the cladribine group and 20%, 25%, and 5% (1) 
of pregnancies in the placebo group. The outcome was unknown in1 case in the placebo group. 
Adverse outcomes were reported for the newborns of 3 subjects treated with cladribine. In one of the three 
cases (asphyxia of the fetus) no further information was available. In the other two cases, he women becam 
pregnant more than 2 years after last administration of cladribine. No adverse outcomes were reported for 
the newborns of trial subjects treated with placebo. 
Only 16 out of the total 38 patient who got pregnant became pregnant during administration of cladribine or 
within 6 months after the last dose. Three (3) of these pregnancies resulted in live births, 10 were 
terminated by abortion per decision of the patient, 1 was a medically induced abortion due to ectopic 
pregnancy, and 2 patients experienced spontaneous abortions. 
In total, 11 female partners of study participants experienced 12 pregnancies. Of the study participants, 
9 received cladribine and 2 received placebo. In the female partners of the 9 cladribine-treated subjects 
10 pregnancies were noted. Of these, 9 resulted in live births.

Overdose and drug abuse 
Events of overdose were few and no excessive toxicity was observed. 
Cladribine has no known potential for drug abuse. 
High Disease Activity 
Across HDA groups, lymphopenia was consistently reported with high Adj-AE per 100PY rates compared to 
placebo. Data regarding severity of AEs, SAEs and malignancies by HDA cohort have not been provided.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug-drug interaction studies with Refib and cladribine as well as with pantoprazole and cladribine have been 
conducted. These are discussed in section 2.4.  
Notably, a potentiation of haematological adverse events, particularly reduction of lymphocyte count, has 
been observed with some concomitant DMDs. The laboratory safety data obtained in the drug-drug 
interaction studies with Refib suggested potential additive PD effects of the known haematological 
treatment-emergent adverse effects of both products, which was corroborated by ALC modeling (on ORACLE 
MS). Furthermore, higher incidences of severe lymphopenia were observed when cladribine was given with 
concomitant IFN-β treatment in ONWARD compared to monotherapy in CLARITY. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Within the Monotherapy Oral cohort, the incidence rate of treatment discontinuation due to TEAEs was higher 
in the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg group than the placebo group (adj-AE per 100PY : 2.07 vs 1.05). There was 
evidence of a dose relationship (placebo, cladribine 3.5 mg/kg, and cladribine 5.25 mg/kg, respectively): 
1.05 vs 2.07 vs 2.44. 
In the cladribine-treated groups, TEAEs leading to discontinuation occurred primarily in the Blood and 
Lymphatic System Disorders SOC and the Investigations SOC, especially discontinuation due to lymphopenia 
was more pronounced upon re-exposure and differs from the placebo cohort (adj-AE per 100PY: 0.05 for 
placebo, 0.78 for cladribine 3.5 mg/kg, 1.30 for cladribine 5.25 mg/kg, 3.03 for cladribine 3.5 mg/kg re-
exposed, and 3.24 for cladribine 5.25 mg/kg re-exposed). Notably, in the All Exposed cohort, 2 cases of 
hepatitis B were reported as TEAEs leading to treatment discontinuation. One of these cases was fatal.  
Post-marketing experience 
Cladribine is not currently marketed for the treatment of MS. While a marketing authorisation was granted in 
Russia and Australia previously, it was later withdrawn. Overall, 22 case report of a total of 68 AEs were 
received by post-approval sources (cut-off date: 29 February 2016). The sources of these cases were 
consumers (8 reports) and health care professionals (14 reports). The most frequent events reported from 
post-approval sources were oropharyngeal pain (5 events), cough, fatigue and headache (4 events reported 
each) and nausea (3 reports). Lymphopenia and herpes zoster were reported once each (all non-serious).  
The RECORD MS Study, whose main objectives were to quantify the risk (cumulative incidence) of serious 
adverse drug reactions and to quantify and monitor the risk Grade 3 and Grade 4 lymphopenias, only 
Assessment report

Page 108/131 
  
  
recruited 35 patients. Two AEs (in the same subject) were assessed by the Investigator as serious adverse 
drug reactions: lymphocyte count decreased and prostate cancer. 
Cladribine parenteral solution is currently also approved for use in two oncology indications: hairy cell 
leukaemia and chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. In the EU, cladribine is approved for use in hairy cell 
leukaemia as (Litak® and Leustatin®). Notably, patients with hairy cell leukaemia have an inherent increase 
risk of secondary malignancies. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
For the integrated safety analyses, data were primarily derived from the CLARITY, CLARITY EXT, ORACLE MS, 
ONWARD and the PREMIERE Registry. The Scripps studies with parenteral cladribine also contributed data. 
Patients were analysed by three defined cohorts: All Exposed Cohort, Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled Cohort 
and Monotherapy Oral Cohort. 
Subjects exposed to cladribine were more numerous and followed over a longer period of time compared with 
placebo resulting in a larger exposure in terms of patient years of treatment and follow-up for the cladribine-
treated subjects: A total of 1976 subjects received at least one dose of cladribine and 802 received placebo in 
the integrated safety database translating into 8650 PY of exposure to cladribine (exposure and follow-up) 
and 2361 PY of exposure to placebo. The size of the patient population in the cladribine study program and 
the pooled number of PY of exposure to cladribine was considered sufficient to evaluate the overall safety 
profile of cladribine.  
The most frequently occurring AEs belonged to the MedDRA SOC of Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders 
and Infections and Infestations. TEAEs were generally more frequent among the cladribine-treated patients 
compared to the placebo-treated patients and there was a dose-dependent increase in the rate of patients 
with at least 1 TEAE. The majority of events were mild or moderate in severity. Severe lymphopenia was the 
only severe AE that occurred more frequently in patients receiving cladribine 3.5 mg/kg compared to placebo 
(Adj-AE per 100PY: 0.59 vs. 0.00). Amongst the TEAEs considered related to treatment, lymphopenia, 
leukopenia, lymphocyte count decreased, neutropenia and herpes zoster occured with a higher rate in the 
active arms compared to placebo. Data presented for HDA patients gave no indication of different AE profiles 
by HDA groups and compared to non-HDA patients. 
With regard to SAEs, the Adj-AE per 100PY rate of at least 1 SAE was 3.57 in the placebo group. 
Comparatively, in the 3.5 mg/kg cladribine group it was 4.00, and in the 3.5 mg/kg re-exposed cladribine 
group it was 4.29. Similar rates were observed in the 5.25 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/kg re-exposed groups. While 
the overall rate of SAEs was generally similar across treatment groups, differences between placebo and 
cladribine groups were observed for, among others, SAEs belonging to the SOCs of Neoplasms [Adj-AE per 
100PY rate 0.50 (placebo) vs. 0.74 (cladribine 3.5 mg/kg)], Infections and Infestations [Adj-AE per 100PY 
rate 0.50 (placebo) vs. 0.69 (cladribine 3.5 mg/kg)], Nervous System Disorders [Adj-AE per 100PY rate 0.25 
(placebo) vs. 0.32 (cladribine 3.5 mg/kg)] and Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders [Adj-AE per 100PY 
rate 0 (placebo) vs. 0.29 (cladribine 3.5 mg/kg)]. The latter was primarily driven by cases of serious 
lymphopenia. For most of the listed SOCs, an apparent dose-dependent pattern of SAEs was observed albeit 
the absolute number of SAEs was limited.  
In the Placebo-controlled Double-blind cohort, the Adj-AE per 100PY rate of death was higher in cladribine-
treated subjects (0.29),than among the placebo-treated patients (0.18) whereas there was no difference in 
the other cohorts. There was an apparent increased frequency of deaths due to malignancies (see discussion 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 109/131 
  
  
on malignancies below). No increased frequency of suicide, suicide attempts, potential suicide and suicidal 
ideation among cladribine-treated patients has been identified.  
Across the different cohorts and analyses conducted, lymphopenia consistently occurred at markedly 
increased rates in cladribine-treated patients compared with the placebo groups. Moreover, a dose-
dependent pattern was observed, e.g. in the Monotherapy Oral Cohort the rate of adj-AE per 100PY was 
12.62, 7.94 and 1.06 in the cladribine 5.25mg/kg, the cladribine 3.5mg/kg and the placebo groups, 
respectively. A dose-dependent increase was also observed for severe (Grade ≥3) lymphopenia. Notably, re-
exposure in Years 3 and 4 was associated with an increase in the incidence rates of lymphopenia AEs (Adj-
AESI per 100PY of 1.94 in the cladribine 3.5mg/kg re-exposed group and 1.82 in the cladribine 5.25 mg/kg 
re-exposed group). This is coupled with an increased occurrence of Herpes Zoster in patients treated with 
cladribine compared to placebo, which furthermore occurred at a higher rate in patients with Grade ≥3 
lymphopenia. These findings were not surprising given that the mechanism of action of cladribine is based on 
a selective depletion of lymphocytes which in turn predispose patients to infectious diseases. 
As supported by laboratory haematology parameters, cladribine treatment resulted in quite rapid and marked 
depletion of both T cell and B cell counts. There is evidence that particularly the T cells recover slowly, e.g. 
median CD4+ counts values remained below baseline at Week 240 in cladribine treatment groups including 
those without re-treatment in year 3 and 4. This is also supported by data from CLARITY with median 
durations of Grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia of 5.4 months and 5.6 months, respectively, for the cladribine 3.5 
mg/kg and cladribine 5.25 mg/kg groups. In contrast, although rapid decreases are evident, the B cell counts 
as well as the neutrophil count slowly but gradually recover towards baseline. Decreases in red blood cell 
count, haematocrit, haemoglobin or platelet count compared to baseline values have also been observed but 
these parameters usually remained within normal limits. 
During the course of the cladribine study program, risk minimization strategies involving stricter 
haematological criteria were implemented prior to initiation of treatment or re-treatment. Patients were to 
have a normal ALC before initiation of cladribine treatment in year 1 and an ALC which is within the normal 
range or not worse than Grade 1 (lower limt 800 cell/mm3) before treatment in year 2. Data from ORACLE 
MS and ONWARD indeed support that this measure contributed to reducing the number of cases of 
lymphopenia, their severity and duration. Modeling data further supported postponement of the 
administration of cladribine in year 2 by up to 6 months in the event of prolonged lymphopenia without 
adversely affecting efficacy (see section 2.4.3. ). However, prolonged severe lymphopenia also occurred in 
several patients with no apparent association with baseline haematological parameters. No indicators could 
be identified that were clearly predictive of prolonged severe lymphopenia. Nevertheless, as a risk 
minimization strategy, the proposed treatment initiation and re-treatment criteria were agreed. Furthermore, 
additional warnings and recommendation as regards to lymphocyte monitoring and anti-herpetic prophylaxis 
have been introduced in the SmPC. Further information and guidance was also agreed to be provided in a 
prescriber and patient guide (see section 2.7. ). 
With regards to infections, the incidences of the most frequently reported TEAEs were generally similar 
between placebo-treated and cladribine-treated groups with the exception of Herpes Zoster. A higher 
incidence of severe and serious infections was observed among the cladribine-treated patients as compared 
to placebo. However, absolute numbers were low. Further, there were 3 fatal cases of infection, all of which 
occurred in patients treated with cladribine.  
Three cases tuberculosis in the cladribine development programme were reported. All cases occurred before 
tuberculosis screening was introduced in the study protocols and no cases thereafter. Therefore, it was 
unknown whether these events were due to reactivation of latent tuberculosis or new events. There were also 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 110/131 
  
  
two cases of hepatitis B infection, one of which was fatal and probably acquired during the trial. No 
information was available to allow assessment of whether the other case was a reactivation of a latent 
infection. As a precautionary measure against reactivation of latent infections, the CHMP considered that 
cladribine should not be used in patient with active chronic infection, which was consequently added to the 
list of contraindications. Further, a warning was included in SmPC section 4.4 requiring screening for latent 
infections, in particular tuberculosis and hepatitis B and C, prior to initiation of therapy in year 1 and year 2. 
Vaccination of varicella zoster antibody-negative patients prior to treatment initiation as also recommended. 
Overall, the Adj-AE per 100PY of opportunistic infections (excluded herpetic infections) was similar between 
placebo-treated and cladribine-treated patients. Many of the observed events represented diseases that can 
also be observed in normal, non-immunocompromised patients. During periods of Grade 3 or 4 lymphopenia 
in patients treated with cladribine, more opportunistic infections were reported as compared to patients 
without severe lymphopenia (adj-AE per 1—PY 2.23 versus 0.93 in the All Exposed Cohort; 1.73 versus 1.03 
in the Monotherapy Oral Cohort). However, the overall incidence of opportunistic infections during severe 
lymphopenia was low and, with the exception of two events, of mild severity. Severe and opportunistic 
infections are considered an important potential risk of cladribine and risk mitigation measures include 
contraindications for immunocompromised patients and patients with human immunodeficiency virus 
infection. 
No cases of PML have been observed in over 8500 PYs of exposure to cladribine in the development program 
for MS. However, as PML has been observed in patients using cladribine for the treatment of hairy cell 
leukaemia, baseline MRI were recommended before initiating MAVENCLAD and PML should continue to be 
monitored as part of pharmacovigilance activities.  
With regards to malignancies, incidence rates were higher among the cladribine-treated patients as compared 
to placebo. In particular, there was the 3 fold higher incidence of solid tumours excluding NMSC in the 
cladibine group as compared to placebo (RR of 3.29 in the All Exposed cohort). Among the baseline factors 
related to cancer risk only age was convincingly demonstrated to be important but it did not explain the 
observed imbalance in incidence of malignancy. 
There was no evidence of an increased incidence of cervical dysplasia in the cladribine group compared to the 
placebo group and the cases with cervical dysplasia or cervix carcinoma did not show any relation to grade ≥ 
3 lymphopenia. 
Theoretically, the immunosuppressive properties, in particular the suppression of CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, 
may contribute to increased malignancy rates. As CD8+ T cells were suppressed for 2 years and CD4+ T cells 
were suppressed for 4 years following cladribine treatment, there is biological plausible mechanism that can 
explain the higher frequency of malignancies. Furthermore, it is striking that by year 2 on study, 1 
malignancy has developed in the placebo group as opposed to 10 malignancies in the cladribine group. This 
trend continues through year 4 by which a total of 2 malignancies in the placebo group have developed as 
opposed to a total of 24 in the cladribine group. By year 6 this tendency is maintained. By the final 
observation, a total of 4 malignancies have occurred in the placebo group. This is in contrast to the 32 
malignancies in the cladribine group. 
However, the Applicant has presented data regarding the CD4+ and CD8+ counts and associated 
malignancies and a causal relationship could not be established. A lower level of immune surveillance due to 
a reduction in CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes would result in virus-induced cancer or skin cancer. However, 
virus-induced cancer was not seen after cladribine treatment and skin cancer was not increased compared to 
placebo. In addition, the clinical program did not show malignancies of cell types which are mostly affected 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 111/131 
  
  
by cladribine’s mechanism of action (ie, lymphocytes). Further, the pattern of the malignancies with 
cladribine showed a high variety of tumour types and no clustering of specific tumour types has been seen.  
In addition, clinical data support an overall latency period, from the initiation of the neoplastic event to the 
actual clinical detection of a solid tumour commonly in the range of 10 to 20 years (Hill & Tannock, 1998). 
Time from exposure to cancer diagnosis thus would seem shorter than would have been expected in case of 
true solid cancer induction by cladribine. The pattern regarding time to occurrence and types of malignancies 
may be compatible with unspecific promotion of already induced malignancies. 
The Applicant also argued that the imbalance in the rate of malignancies between cladribine treated patients 
and those receiving placebo was driven by the low incidence rate under placebo. This was supported by a 
comparison with epidemiological data from the GLOBOCAN database as well as a cross-study comparison 
after 2-years of exposure with other DMDs. Nevertheless, uncertainties remained and the CHMP considered 
that any explanation regarding the observed imbalance in the incidence of malignancies remained largely 
speculative. Cladribine should therefore not be used in patients with active malignancies and standard cancer 
screening guidelines should be followed in patients treated with MAVENCLAD. Furthermore, a large, 
prospective, comparative Post Authorization Safety Study (PASS) will be performed to further monitor and 
characterize the potential malignancy risk with cladribine (category 3 in the RMP). 
For the AEs alopecia, rash, and neutrophil count decrease, higher incidence rates have been observed on 
cladribine compared to placebo in the Placebo-Controlled Double-Blind cohort, and an apparent dose 
relationship was seen in the Monotherapy Oral cohort. Therefore, these events were included in the list of 
adverse reactions in SmPC section 4.8. 
A number of special populations, such as patients with renal impairment, hepatic impairment, elderly and 
paediatric patients have not been studied and this is considered justified. Some experience with pregnancies 
and partner pregnancies was, however, available from the clinical trials program, despite pregnant or 
lactating women being excluded from all studies. No malformations or adverse pregnancy outcomes were 
observed that were attributable to cladribine exposure. However, the majority of pregnancies occurred some 
time after cladribine was administered and there is very limited from pregnancies carried through under 
actual exposure to cladribine. In light of the mechanism of action of cladribine and the non-clinical safety 
findings (see section 2.3. ), teratogenicity was considered a potential risk of cladribine treatment and the 
current recommendation to avoid pregnancy in the 6 months following the last dose of cladribine was 
considered appropriate. Furthermore, use in pregnant women is contraindicated. A pregnancy PASS will be 
conducted to gather additional data on the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in pregnant women exposed 
to oral cladribine and in pregnancies fathered by male partner exposed to oral cladribine (category 3 in the 
RMP). Furthermore, additional information will be provided in the prescriber and patient guide including 
advice for use of effective contraception. 
No significant PK interactions have been identified but PD interactions following simultaneous administration 
of immunosuppressive agents suggest a potential additive effect on the immune system caused by other 
immunosuppressants. Initiation of cladribine treatment in immunocompromised patients, including patients 
currently receiving immunosuppressive or myelosuppressive therapy is therefore contraindicated. Care 
should be taken when using cladribine in patients who have previously been treated with immunomodulatory 
or immunosuppressive medicinal products and also when such medicinal products are used after treatment 
with MAVENCLAD. Furthermore, a higher incidence of lymphopenia was observed when cladribine was given 
with concomitant IFN-β treatment. While no experience of concomitant use with other DMDs was available, 
concomitant treatment is not recommended. Furthermore, sequential use of cladribine and other DMDs will 
be evaluated in the long-term PASS.  
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 112/131 
  
  
No immunological events have been observed. As cladribine is a small molecule, immunological events are 
not expected to be associated with cladribine.  
Post-marketing data have contributed knowledge regarding cladribine used concomitantly or 
preceding/following other DMDs and reports of secondary malignancies have also been obtained through 
pharmacovigilance activities. With the exception of the possible malignancy signal (see above), post-
marketing reporting has not identified unexpected safety issues. Additional safety data will be gather post-
authorisation through routine Pharmacovigilance measures as well as via the PREMIERE registry, which 
includes subjects previously enrolled CLARITY, CLARITY EXT, ONWARD and ORACLE (category 3 PASS in the 
RMP) and other PASS as described above. 
Additional expert consultations 
During  the  course  of  the  assessment  of  the  present  application,  the  CHMP  decided  to  consult  the  Scientific 
Advisory Group Neurology on a number of questions related to the benefits, risks and the identification of a 
suitable target population for cladribine. See section 2.5.5. for the answers of the experts.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the CHMP was of the view that the available clinical safety data were adequate for the purpose of 
assessing the safety of cladribine for the use as treatment of adult patients with highly active RMS. The main 
safety issues were related to the risks of prolonged severe lymphopenia, infections including reactivation of 
latent infections and opportunistic infections as well as malignancies. For the latter, uncertainties due to the 
observed imbalance of cases occurring in patients treated with cladribine compared to placebo as well as the 
low number of events remained, although supportive analyses did not support a causal association. Overall, 
the risk minimisation measures including the safety information in the product information as well as the 
prescriber and patient guide were considered adequate to address the risks with cladribine treatment, while 
further data are gathered in the post-marketing setting.

Conclusion 
The  CHMP  and  PRAC  considered  that  the  risk  management  plan  version  1.3  (dated  18  June  2017)  is 
acceptable.  
2.8.   Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
Based on the difference in the patient population compared to approved cladribine products (hairy cell 
leukaemia) and in light of the risks of severe prolonged lymphopenia and infections, the CHMP is of the 
opinion that a separate entry in the EURD list for MAVENCLAD is needed, as it cannot follow the already 
existing entry for cladribine. The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this 
medicinal product are set out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request the 
alignment of the new PSUR cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 8 July 2010. The new 
EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
MAVENCLAD was initially proposed for the treatment of adult patients with highly active RRMS as defined by 
clinical or imaging features. During the course of the procedure the indication was revised to adult patients 
with highly active RMS. High disease activity (HDA) patients were defined taking into account clinical and MRI 
criteria as previously used for DMDs approved in MS patients with HDA (fingolimod and natalizumab) and 
included patients with 1 relapse in the previous year and at least 1 T1 Gd+ lesion or 9 or more T2 lesions, 
while on therapy with other DMDs or patients with 2 or more relapses in the previous year, whether on DMD 
treatment or not.  
MS is an inflammatory neurodegenerative disorder of the CNS which involves demyelination and neuronal 
loss resulting in neurological impairment and severe disability. In approximately 85% of patients, the disease 
initially presents as a relapsing, episodic disorder with gradual complete or incomplete recovery (RRMS). The 
aim of the treatment is to suppress relapses and delay disease progression. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
In addition to treatments for MS symptoms as well as acute relapses, there were 12 approved DMDs for the 
treatment of patients with RRMS and/or other forms of RMS in the EU at the time of this report. Therapy of 
patients with active disease is usually initiated with treatments with modest effect and more benign safety 
profile (e.g. IFN-ß, glatiramer acetate, or teriflunomide). If the treatment response is unsatisfactory, 
treatment alternatives with high efficacy and more unfavourable safety profile can be used such as 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 119/131 
  
  
 
natalizumab, alemtuzumab or fingolimod. The latter treatments are also authorised and used to initiate 
treatment in patients with HDA. 
Despite available treatment alternatives for RRMS patients there is a need for additional highly effective 
treatments with improved safety profile and convenient administration regimen in order to increase 
treatment compliance.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Four randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II/III studies have been provided in support of the 
present application for cladribine.  
The pivotal Phase III study CLARITY along with its 2-year extension CLARITY EXT were randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled trials evaluating the efficacy and safety of cladribine in patients with RRMS over a 
period of 2 years (96 weeks). A total of 1,326 patients were randomized in CLARITY and assigned to one of 
three treatment arms (low cumulative cladribine dose 3.5mg/kg, high cumulative cladribine dose 5.25mg/kg 
or placebo). Of these, 806 patients continued into CLARITY EXT to receive either placebo or low dose 
cladribine (3.5mg/kg) over an additional period of 2 years. Five treatment groups were investigated: LLPP 
(3.5 mg/kg during CLARITY, placebo in CLARITY EXT), HLPP (5.25 mg/kg during CLARITY, placebo in 
CLARITY EXT), LLLL (3.5 mg/kg during CLARITY, 3.5 mg/kg in CLARITY EXT), HLLL (5.25 mg/kg during 
CLARITY, 3.5 mg/kg in CLARITY EXT) and PPLL (placebo during CLARITY, 3.5 mg/kg in CLARITY EXT). 
Efficacy was evaluated based on both clinical and imaging parameters. The primary endpoint in CLARITY was 
ARR at 96 weeks. Secondary endpoints included time to sustained change (pre-defined at 3 months) in EDSS 
score over the course of the study as well as various MRI measures. Efficacy was an exploratory objective in 
CLARITY EXT; the main purpose of the extension study was to investigate long-term safety of cladribine. 
Additional supportive data were available from the Phase II, multicenter, double-blind, randomized study 
ONWARD which aimed at evaluating the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of oral cladribine as an add-on to 
IFN-β treatment in subjects with RMS (RRMS and SPMS with relapses) who had experienced a sub-optimal 
treatment response to IFN-β monotherapy. Furthermore, data were presented from ORACLE MS, a 96 week 
Phase III, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of oral cladribine in subjects with early disease who had experienced a first clinical demyelinating event and 
were at high risk of converting to definite MS.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the pivotal CLARITY study, the primary endpoint was met for both doses of cladribine. The ARRs were 0.15 
(95% CI: 0.12, 0.17) for cladribine 5.25 mg/kg, 0.14 (95% CI: 0.12, 0.17) for cladribine 3.5 mg/kg, and 
0.33 (95% CI: 0.29, 0.38) for placebo. The difference between both active arms and placebo were 
statistically significant (p<0.001). For the secondary endpoint, 3-month sustained change in EDSS score over 
96 weeks, the hazard ratios (HR) were 0.67 (95% CI: 0.48, 0.93, p = 0.018) and 0.69 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.96, 
p=0.026) for cladribine 3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/kg, respectively, compared to placebo. Post-hoc analysis 
defining the timeframe of sustained disease progression at 6-months in line with the MS Guideline resulted in 
HRs compared with placebo of 0.53 (95% CI: 0.36, 0.79, p=0.0016) and 0.68 (95% CI: 0.47, 0.97, 
p=0.0332) for cladribine 3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/kg respectively. Secondary MRI-related endpoints included 
the mean number of active T1 Gd+-enhanced lesions per subject per scan, mean number of active T2 lesions 
per subject per scan and mean number of CU lesions per subject per scan (all measured at 96 weeks). For all 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 120/131 
  
  
imaging endpoints, a statistically significant difference between active treatment (both doses) and placebo 
was found (p<0.001 for all comparisons). There were no differences between the cladribine doses.  
Post hoc analyses in high disease activity (HDA) patients were conducted using 4 different, although 
overlapping subgroup definitions (HDA1-4). Across all subgroups, HDA patients had more pronounced effects 
than non-HDA patients for both ARR and time to disability progression, but not for MRI and NEDA endpoints 
where there was no difference. For the primary endpoint ARR, HDA patients treated with cladribine 3.5 
mg/kg had a relapse rate of 0.16-0.22 versus 0.47-0.57 in HDA patients treated with placebo. The relative 
risk ranged from 0.32 to 0.38. In the non-HDA subgroups treated with cladribine 3.5 mg/kg, the relapse rate 
was 0.13-0.14 versus 0.29-0.30 in the non-HDA placebo groups. The relative risk was 0.43-0.49. While there 
was a trend of a larger effect size with cladribine 3.5mg/kg in HDA patients compared non-HDA patients 
throughout all 4 subgroups, the differences did not reach statistical significance. 
With regards to disability progression, patients treated with cladribine 3.5 mg/kg and having high disease 
activity defined by at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on DMD therapy and at least 1 T1 Gd+ lesion 
or 9 T2 lesions, OR 2 or more relapses in the previous year regardless of previous treatment status 
(subgroup HDA4) had lower HRs (HR = 0.28; 95%CI: 0.15, 0.54) compared to the HR in the non-HDA4 
patients (HR = 0.8; 95% CI: 0.55, 1,17) for time to 3 months confirmed EDSS disability progression. The 
difference was statistically significant (p=0.0079). For time to 6-months confirmed disease progression, the 
HR was 0.18 (95%CI: 0.07; 0.43) for HDA4 patients and 0.82 (95% CI: 0.51, 1.30) for non-HDA4 patients 
(p=0.0037).  
In the extension study CLARITY EXT, exploratory efficacy analyses were conducted including ARR: LLPP 0.15 
(97.5% CI: 0.09, 0.21), HLPP 0.13 (97.5% CI: 0.08; 0.19), LLLL 0.10 (97.5% CI: 0.06; 0.13), HLLL 0.12 
(97.5% CI: 0.08; 0.16) and PPLL 0.10 (97.5% CI: 0.07; 0.13). Comparison of the ARRs observed in CLARITY 
and CLARITY EXT as well as across the treatment groups in CLARITY EXT showed no clinically meaningful 
difference for any of the comparisons, with the only exception, as expected, for the group of patients 
switching from placebo in CLARITY to low dose cladribine in CLARITY EXT. For these patients the ARR was 
reduced from 0.33 (at the end of CLARITY) to 0.10, which is in the range of the effect observed for the active 
treatment arms in CLARITY (see above). No clear pattern in the proportion of subjects with or without 3-
month confirmed EDSS progression was observed.  
In the ONWARD study, the rate of relapses was 0.12 in the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg + IFN-β group and 0.32 in 
the placebo + IFN-β group. The relative risk was 0.37 (95% CI: 0.22, 0.63; p<0.001). Subgroup analyses in 
patients with SPMS and superimposed relapses showed a statistically significant reduction in ARR with 
cladribine 3.5mg/kg (ARR=0.03) compared to placebo (ARR=0.30) with a risk ratio of 0.11 (95% CI: 0.01; 
0.94). Furthermore, an analyses of the combined CLARITY + ONWARD patient population using baseline 
EDSS ≥ 3.5 as a proxy for SPMS (or high risk of transitioning to SPMS) showed no meaningful differences 
when comparing patients who entered the study with a baseline EDSS ≥ 3.5 and the complementary 
subgroup having a baseline EDSS ≤ 3.  
In the ORACLE study, the estimated HR for CDMS conversion was 0.354 (95% CI: 0.226, 0.555; p<0.0001) 
for the cladribine 3.5 mg/kg group vs the placebo group. The estimated HR for the time to CDMS conversion 
was 0.414 (95% CI: 0.269, 0.639; p<0.0001) for the cladribine 5.25 mg/kg group versus the placebo group. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The evaluation of the efficacy of cladribine in patients with high disease activity mainly relied on post hoc 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 121/131 
  
  
subgroup analyses in the CLARITY study. Patients recruited into CLARITY appeared to have generally mild 
disease, which is reflected in the low ARR in the placebo group (0.33), which was somewhat lower compared 
to the ARR in the placebo group of clinical trials with recently approved DMDs. As a consequence, the 
proportion of patients fulfilling the 4 HDA definitions was limited with the largest number patients (n=437, 
33%) fulfilling the criteria of subgroup HDA4 (patients with at least 1 relapse in the previous year while on 
DMD therapy and at least 1 T1 Gd+ lesion or 9 T2 lesions, OR 2 or more relapses in the previous year 
regardless of previous treatment status). However, despite this limitation, a trend for an increased effect in 
patients with HDA was observed both for reduction in ARR as well as for time to confirmed EDSS progression 
as compared to non-HDA patients. 
Experts consulted during the course of the procedure pointed out that some of the shortcomings in the 
clinical trial program of CLARITY may be due to the fact that the pivotal study was initiated several years 
ago, whereby in the meantime the therapeutic landscape has changed. For example an active comparator 
would have been desirable to put into perspective the benefits of cladribine. Furthermore, since the 
conception of CLARITY, guideline requirements have changed including the assessment of sustained disability 
progression over a period of 6 months rather than 3 months (as pre-defined in CLARITY). 
The CHMP also noted that results from CLARITY EXT were only exploratory and should thus be interpreted 
with caution. However, the results suggest that there was no added benefit with retreatment in years 3 and 
4. In addition, for the MRI endpoints the interpretation of the results is hampered by the fact that there were 
different numbers of MRI scans for CLARITY and the CLARITY EXT studies as well as a considerable 
proportion of missing data for certain analyses. The results of the MRI endpoint are, however, not pivotal for 
the benefit/risk assessment. It is currently not clear how the treating physicians would handle reoccurrence 
of disease activity. The applicant agreed to further investigate recurrence of disease activity and how this is 
handled post-authorisation as part of the planned long-term cohort PASS. 
Only a limited number of patients older than 55 years (n=32) was included in the clinical development 
program of cladribine. Given that recently, it was demonstrated that natalizumab is more effective in younger 
patients compared to the older ones (Matell et al., 2015), the question arose if a similar age effect was 
present for cladribine. However, subgroup analyses in patients aged ≤50 years (n=1155) compared to 
patients >50 years (n=171) showed beneficial effects of cladribine 3.5 mg/kg and 5.25 mg/kg in both age 
groups in line with the results for the overall study population. 
With regards to the ONWARD study, the study was not designed for a formal proof of efficacy and therefore 
likely not adequately powered for efficacy evaluation. In particular, subgroup analyses in SPMS patients with 
superimposed relapses were based on very low numbers of patients. The small number of patients and 
events may explain to some extent that no difference in the effect on disability progression between 
treatment groups was observed.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the integrated safety database comprised a total of 8650 PY of exposure to cladribine (exposure and 
follow-up) and 2361 PY of exposure to placebo.  
The most frequently occurring AEs belonged to the MedDRA SOC of Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders 
and Infections and Infestations. TEAEs were generally more frequent among the cladribine-treated patients 
compared to the placebo-treated patients and there was a dose-depended increase in the rate of patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 122/131 
  
  
with at least 1 TEAE. No major difference in the AE profiles of HDA compared to non-HDA patients was 
observed. 
Cladribine induced a 42% reduction of median lymphocyte counts during treatment year 1. Lymphopenia 
developed within weeks (nadir at Week 16 after start of treatment in year 1) and persisted for a prolonged 
period of time (mean duration of Grade ≥3 Lymphopenia in the cladribine 3.5mg/kg group in CLARITY was 
5.4 weeks) with signs of gradual recovery in most patients. In a small subset of patients, however, values 
remained well below baseline even after 240 weeks of follow-up. Patients treated with cladribine generally 
had more severe lymphopenia compared to placebo. Lymphopenia was consistently dose-dependent across 
the clinical programme of cladribine and re-exposure in years 3 and 4 was associated with an increase in the 
incidence rates of lymphopenia (Adj-AESI per 100PY of 1.94 in the cladribine 3.5mg/kg re-exposed group 
and 1.82 in the cladribine 5.25 mg/kg re-exposed group, Monotherapy Oral chohort). 
The overall incidence of infections was approximately about 25 events per 100 patient-years in the 3.5 
mg/kg group and was not more frequent in the cladribine group compared to placebo. However, both severe 
and serious infections per 100 PY were observed more frequently in cladribine treated patients compared to 
placebo; adj-SAE per 100 PY in the All Exposed Cohort was 0.64 (placebo) vs. 0.94 (cladribine). Furthermore, 
herpes zoster occurred more frequently in patients treated with cladribine compared to placebo (adj-AE per 
100PY of 0.20, 0.83, 0.84 for placebo, cladribine 3.5mg/kg, and cladribine 5.25mg/kg). Overall, Grade 3-4 
lymphopenia has been associated with about a two-fold increased risk for infections, e.g. for opportunistic 
infections and herpes zoster, the rates were 1.72 and 2.16 per 100 PY in patients receiving cladribine 
3.5mg/kg with severe lymphopenia and 1.03 and 0.75 in patients receiving cladribine 3.5mg/kg without 
severe lymphopenia. 
Overall, 3 cases of tuberculosis (1 fatal tuberculosis, 2 non-fatal pulmonary tuberculosis) have been seen in 
endemic areas before the introduction of tuberculosis screening and no cases thereafter. Furthermore, two 
cases of hepatitis B (one fatal, which was newly acquired during the study, one non-fatal) were seen. Based 
on these data, a possible role of cladribine in the potential reactivation of pre-existing latent infections cannot 
be ruled out. There were furthermore three deaths due to infections among cladribine treated patients vs. 
zero in the placebo groups, including one case of herpetic meningoencephalitis. So far, no cases of PML have 
been seen in MS patients.  
To address the risk of severe prolonged lymphopenia and associated infectious diseases, the applicant has 
introduced (re)-treatment guidelines for lymphopenia in the clinical programme and since their introduction, 
the duration of grade 3-4 lymphopenia has been reduced from a mean of 5.4 months to 3.0 months and the 
incidence of grade 4 lymphopenia was reduced to 0.4% (ORACLE MS). Furthermore, educational material in 
form of a prescribers and patient guide was agreed. 
There was furthermore a numerical imbalance for malignancies throughout the cladribine development 
programme, including 33 adjudicated malignant events in 32 patients in the cladribine group versus 4 in the 
placebo group in the All Exposed cohort. The comparison of malignant adjudicated tumours based on patient-
years at risk for cladribine versus placebo yields a risk ratio of 2.2 (95% CI 0.78-6.22). The risk was 
increased 3-fold when only considering solid tumours excluding NMSC in the cladribine group as compared to 
placebo (RR of 3.3 95% CI 0.78; 13.92).  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Cladribine has clear immunosuppressive effects and acts as an antimetabolite. In this context the numerical 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 123/131 
  
  
imbalance for malignancies caused concerns. In particular, the RR for solid tumours excluding NMSC (3.29) 
and solid tumours excluding all skin cancers (2.87) disfavoured cladribine. 
Based on experience e.g. from solid organ transplantation, profound immunosuppression over long term is 
expected to give rise to a major increase in NMSC (x20-40) and a modest increase in solid tumours (x2-4). 
Furthermore, certain adaptive immune cells, specifically CD8+ T cells and Th1-polarized CD4+ T cells, both of 
which are suppressed by cladribine, have been shown to exert antitumor effects, particularly in relation to 
solid tumours. Virus-related tumours, such as cervical cancer, are also expected to be more common in this 
setting. Cladribine data however only showed a slight increase in the risk for all skin cancers (RR 1.51) and 
NMSC was not increased (risk ratio 1.09). There was a 3-fold increase in the risk of solid tumours, but no 
increase in virus related tumours and any clear clustering of specific tumour types. In addition, no association 
between malignancy cases and prior experience of lymphopenia of Grade ≥3 was seen. The pattern thus 
clearly deviates from what is expected for an immunosuppressive compound. Furthermore, there were no 
malignancies of cell types which are mostly affected by cladribine’s mechanism of action (ie, lymphocytes).  
With regards to solid tumours, epidemiological data seem to indicate that the incidence in the placebo control 
is lower than expected, while the number of malignancies seen with cladribine was as expected. Furthermore, 
the majority of the cancers observed occurred within the first 4-5 years after treatment. A constant 
malignancy incidence rate was observed for cladribine in Years 1 to 4 and in the period thereafter. In 
contrast, the incidence rates observed for placebo increased over time. After year 4, the incidence of cancer 
was 0.38 per 100 PY in the cladrbine group vs. 0.57 per 100 PY in the placebo group. However, the duration 
of follow up in the placebo group is limited. Overall, it was considered reassuring that the incidence of 
malignancies in the cladribine group does not increase over time.    
Time from exposure to cancer diagnosis seems shorter than would have been expected from a true cancer 
induction by cladribine and the pattern regarding time to occurrence and types of malignancies with a high 
variety and mostly single cases may be more compatible with unspecific promotion of already induced 
malignancies.  
Taking all the available evidence into account, the CHMP was of the view that it was not possible to rule out 
an increased risk of malignancies with cladribine. In light of the uncertainties, the CHMP considered that 
additional data would be needed post-authorisation. To enable the generation of conclusive data on the long-
term cancer risk of cladribine, an additional study should be conducted where long-term treatment with 
cladribine is compared to an active comparator. This was agreed by the applicant who will conduct a post-
authorisation safety study, where cladribine will be compared to fingolimod over a period of 15 years. 
Furthermore, in the cladribine development programme, only about 25% of subjects were exposed to other 
MS-DMDs, of which the vast majority was exposed to IFN-β or glaritamer acetate and very few to other 
immunosuppressants or immunomodulators, prior to treatment with cladribine. Likewise, subsequent to 
cladribine treatment, most patients received the same types of first-line MS-DMDs. Thus, there is limited 
experience from sequential treatment with various types of MS-DMDs including those that act primarily via 
immunosuppression or immunomodulation, such as natalizumab, fingolimod, dimethyl fumarate, or 
alemtuzumab. Sequential use of various MS-DMDs may substantially increase the risk for development of 
malignancies and opportunistic infections such as PML. Therefore, sequential use of cladribine and other 
immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory agents is further studied after approval as part of the long-term 
PASS. This was supported by neurology experts consulted in the course of the procedure. 
Finally, there were 38 patients treated with cladribine experienced 44 pregnancies despite pregnant or 
lactating women being excluded from all studies. No malformations or adverse pregnancy outcomes were 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 124/131 
  
  
observed that were attributable to cladribine exposure. However, only very limited data were available for 
pregnancies during cladribine treatment up until 6 months thereafter. Given the teratogenic effect observed 
in non-clinical trials with mice and rabbits and in light of cladribine’s mechanism of action, teratogenicity was 
considered a potential risk and use in pregnant women is contraindicated. A pregnancy registry will be 
established to gather additional data in the post-authorisation phase. Furthermore, the prescriber and patient 
guide will advise on the risks and recommend use effective contraception.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
For patient with RRMS, a clinically relevant benefit has been shown with cladribine. This was evident from the 
pivotal CLARITY study where a statistically significant and clinically relevant effect on ARR and time to 3 
months and 6 months confirmed EDSS progression (e.g. HR of 0.53 for 6-months sustained change in EDSS 
score with cladribine 3.5mg/kg) over placebo was shown. The observed reduction in ARR by 57% with 
cladribine 3.5mg/kg compared to placebo is similar to efficacy results of some other drugs used for treatment 
of RRMS patients including those indicated for active or highly active disease (e.g. alemtuzumab and 
fingolimod) with the exception of natalizumab which offers approximately 70% reduction of ARR. It is 
acknowledged though that the indirect comparison of observed results in different studies is confounded by 
the limitations associated with cross-study comparisons. The post hoc analysis in patients with high disease 
activity also showed a clear and clinically relevant difference in relapse rate and disease progression 
compared to patients who did not have high disease activity, although cladribine is also effective in the latter 
population, which is reassuring. The observed reduction in ARR (62-68%) in high disease activity patients 
was larger than in the overall study population. 
The findings in CLARITY are to some degree supported by the data from CLARITY EXT, although the results 
from this study should be interpreted with caution, as efficacy was only an exploratory objective. Even if the 
efficacy data from the CLARITY EXTENSION study from a methodological point of view are not strong, the 
clinical efficacy data, in general, point in the same direction and show that the effect of cladribine treatment 
at the beginning of year 1 and 2 is sustained for at least an additional 2 years without any further treatment. 
The data showed that additional treatment cycles do not provide additional benefit but instead add significant 
toxicity in term of prolonged severe lymphopenia, more serious infection as well as a higher risk of 
developing malignancies compared to patients treated only in year 1 and 2.  
An effect on relapses was furthermore shown in a post hoc subgroup analysis in patients with SPMS to a 
similar extent as in RRMS patients. This finding was supported by analyses in patients with baseline EDSS ≥ 
3.5 as a proxy for SPMS (or high risk of transitioning to SPMS). These data support a benefit in patients with 
RMS and thus a broadening of the originally proposed indication in RRMS.  
Despite available treatment alternatives for RMS patients, there is a need for additional highly effective 
treatments with improved safety profile and convenient administration regimen in order to increase 
treatment compliance. In this context, the oral administration of cladribine in two courses separated by 12 
months, requiring no further treatment at least for a period of 4 years, was considered an advantage. This 
was supported by experts and patient representatives consulted during the course of this procedure.  
With respect to the safety profile, cladribine causes prolonged and severe lymphopenia coupled with an 
increase in the rate of serious and severe infections including opportunistic infections associated with 
lymphopenia. However, there were no deaths after implementation of the retreatment guidance. In addition, 
there was a numerical imbalance with regards to deaths caused by infections. These findings were not 
surprising given the mechanism of action of cladribine. Overall, the risk was considered manageable based on 
the implementation of haematological criteria for (re-)treatment and with screening for latent infections, and 
instigation of anti-herpes prophylaxis in case of Grade 4 lymphopenia.    
There was also an imbalance in the rate of malignancies with a 2-3 fold increased risk observed for cladribine 
compared to placebo. This imbalance creates an uncertainty, although the number of cases was overall small 
Assessment report

Page 128/131 
  
  
in particular in light of the large safety database. However, the strength of this signal is questioned based on 
pattern regarding time to occurrence (with the majority of the cancers occurring within the first 4-5 years 
after treatment and with the magnitude of the risk not increasing over time) and types of malignancies, 
which seemed to be more compatible with unspecific promotion of already induced malignancies. However, 
firm conclusion regarding the observed imbalance in the incidence of malignancies remained largely 
speculative and an increased cancer risk with cladribine could not be excluded at the time of this report. A 
post-authorisation safety study will be conducted to provide data for cladribine versus fingolimod and this 
may shed more light on the malignancy risk of cladribine. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
A clinically relevant benefit of cladribine treatment has been demonstrated in RMS patients both in terms of 
reducing the relapse rates and delaying disease progression. A trend towards a greater treatment benefit has 
been observed in a population with high disease activity and for this population the benefits of treatment 
were considered to outweigh the risks of severe prolonged lymphopenia and infections, as well as remaining 
uncertainties pertaining to the increased rate of malignancies seen with cladribine. This also took into account 
the benefits of an oral treatment only requiring two short (4-5 days) courses of treatment separated by 
12 months and with a maintained effect of 4 years. A Scientific Advisory Group consulted during the course of 
the procedure supported this position.  
Overall, the benefit/risk balance of cladribine in the treatment of adult patients with highly active relapsing 
multiple sclerosis as defined by clinical or imaging features was considered favourable. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of MAVENCLAD is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
risk-benefit balance of MAVENCLAD is favourable in the following indication: 
MAVENCLAD is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with highly active relapsing multiple sclerosis 
(MS) as defined by clinical or imaging features. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017

Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product within 
6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the 
RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior  to  launch  of  MAVENCLAD  (cladribine)  in  each  Member  State  (MS)  the  Marketing  Authorisation  Holder 
(MAH) must agree about the content and format of the educational materials (EM), including communication 
media,  distribution  modalities,  and  any  other  aspects  of  the  programme,  with  the  National  Competent 
Authority (NCA).  
The MAH shall ensure that in each MS where MAVENCLAD is marketed, all prescribers and patients who are 
expected to prescribe / use MAVENCLAD are provided with: 
• 
• 
The Prescriber Guide  
The Patient Guide 
The Prescriber Guide should include: 
Assessment report  
EMA/435731/2017 
Page 130/131 
  
  
•  An  introduction  to  MAVENCLAD,  reminding  the  prescriber  to  consider  the  Patient  Guide  while 
discussing  MAVENCLAD  treatment  with  the  patient,  to  support  the  early  identification  of  sign  and 
symptoms of adverse reactions and their timely treatment; 
• 
The treatment regimens; 
•  A  reminder  to  carefully  consider  data  on  blood  count  monitoring  and  screening  for  latent  infections 
before starting the treatment; 
•  Guidance for patient’s monitoring during the treatment;  
• 
Information on pregnancy prevention 
The Patient Guide should include an introduction to MAVENCLAD treatment, its side effects, potential risks 
and information on pregnancy prevention. 
The prescriber / patient guide should include information about the following safety concerns: 
• 
Important identified risks 
1.  Severe  (Grade  ≥  3)  lymphopenia,  to  ensure  compliance  to  haematological  testing  and  treatment 
requirements; 
2.  Herpes zoster infections, to ensure awareness of signs and symptoms suggestive for these infections; 
3.  Tuberculosis, to raise awareness about this risk; 
• 
Important potential risks 
1.  Progressive  multifocal  leukoencephalopathy  (PML),  opportunistic  infections  (other  than  PML  and 
tuberculosis) and severe infections, to ensure awareness of signs and symptoms suggestive of these 
risks; 
2.  Malignancies, to raise awareness on this risk because: 
a.  Patients with current active malignancies must not receive MAVENCLAD treatment;  
b.  Patients  should  be  advised  to  undertake  standard  cancer  screening  after  MAVENCLAD 
treatment; 
3.  Teratogenicity/adverse pregnancy outcomes, to ensure that female patients of child bearing potential 
/ partners of male patients receiving MAVENCLAD: 
a.  Receive  counselling  before  starting  the  treatment  (consisting  of  two  treatment  courses 
administered at the beginning of two consecutive years) both in year 1 and 2; 
b.  Use effective contraception during the treatment and for at least 6 months after the last dose  
It  is  currently  unknown  whether MAVENCLAD  may  reduce  the  effectiveness  of  systemically  acting  hormonal 
contraceptives.  Therefore  women  of  child  bearing  potential,  using  systemically  acting  hormonal 
contraceptives,  should  add  a  barrier  method  during  Cladribine  treatment  and  up  to  4  weeks  after  the  last 
dose.

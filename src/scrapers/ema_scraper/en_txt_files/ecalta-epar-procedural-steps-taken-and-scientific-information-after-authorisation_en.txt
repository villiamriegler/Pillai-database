Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and

efficacy, including all variations introduced since the 
and PL 
marketing authorisation was granted, the CHMP considers 
by consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Ecalta in the 
treatment of invasive candidiasis remains favourable and 
therefore recommends the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation. The CHMP agrees that the identified 
hepatobiliary effects remain a serious concern for Ecalta. 
Hepatobiliary effects have been observed in preclinical as 
well as clinical studies before marketing authorisation. 
Page 9/16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During post-marketing surveillance cases of various forms 
of hepatic injuries have been reported. Based on these 
pharmacovigilance grounds with the remaining concerns 
over identified serious hepatobiliary adverse effects, the 
CHMP agreed that the renewal for the Ecalta, powder for 
concentrate for solution for infusion, can be granted for a 
period of five years and that one additional five-year 
renewal is required.

previous 1-year PSUR. In addition, an increased number of 
reports of anaphylactic reactions and anaphylactic shock 
were reported (2 cases versus 1 and 4 cases versus 1 
respectively). Consequently, the CHMP agreed with the 
MAH’s proposal to update the Ecalta Product Information in 
order to add a warning regarding anaphylactic reactions 
and infusion-related reactions as well as to add 
anaphylactic reaction and anaphylactic shock among the 
undesirable effects. Given the uncommon frequency of the 
adverse events anaphylactic shock and anaphylactic 
reaction and considering the established efficacy of Ecalta, 
the benefit risk balance of this medicinal product remains 
positive.

requested by the CHMP, the MAH took the 
opportunity to propose an alternative wording to the 
hepatic effects warning in section 4.4.

increasing after repeated concentration. However, there 
was no discussion on the blood brain barrier and no 
interpretation for the human situation could be performed. 
The CHMP noted that, when the MAH will request an 
extension of the indication for a paediatric population, 
further discussion about the predictivity of animal data for 
the human situation will be needed. In one of the

confirmed in the second toxicological study. Overall these 
pharmacokinetic and toxicological observations and the 
conclusions of the studies are in line with those observed in 
the previously submitted studies and did not affect the 
risk/benefit balance of Ecalta. The proposed changes to 
update sections 4.4 and 5.3 of the SmPC are acceptable.

SmPC, Annex 
The cumulative review of infusion-associated reactions 
section 4.8 of the SmPC to add the infusion-
II and PL 
provided by the MAH showed a total of 19 cases. Of these, 
associated undesirable reactions and section 5.1 to 
update the microbiology data (activity in-vitro). In 
addition, section 4.4 was amended to clarify the 
description of hepatic failure. 
The MAH took the opportunity to update the internet 
address of the Agency in the Product Information 
and to update the RMP version number in Annex IIB. 
The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly. 
C.I.3.b - Implementation of change(s) requested 
following the assessment of an USR, class labelling, a 
PSUR, RMP, FUM/SO, data submitted under Article 
45/46, or amendments to reflect a Core SPC - 
Change(s) with new additional data submitted by the 
MAH 
10 cases were considered to be possible or probable 
infusion associated reactions based on the timing of the 
events, response to actions taken, and possible alternative 
causes for the events. Consequently, the CHMP agreed to 
add the terms 'Dyspnoea', 'Hypotension' and 
'Bronchospasm' to section 4.8 of the SmPC since they were 
reported in more than one case or represented a potentially 
more severe reaction than that ones already included in the 
SmPC. The CHMP also noted that the MAH will continue to 
monitor infusion-associated adverse events (inclusive 
anaesthetic exacerbations) and that the information in the 
SmPC may be further reviewed following the availability of 
on-going trials and on the basis of spontaneous reports. 
The CHMP agreed with the MAH proposal to replace the 
term 'Worsening hepatic failure' in section 4.4 of the SmPC 
with the corresponding Preferred Term 'Hepatic failure'. 
Three cases of 'hepatic failure' were reported in the MAH 
safety database. The MAH was also requested to follow-on 
and supplement the reported hepatic cases, as well as to 
perform a cumulative review and thoroughly discuss 
whether liver events will have to be included in the product

information within the next PSUR.  
In view of the most recent available data on susceptibility, 
the information on reports of Candida isolates with reduced 
susceptibility to echinocandins was updated in section 5.1. 
Considering that susceptibility breakpoints for 
echinocandins are being revised and/or established, it was 
agreed that it was premature to include interpretive criteria 
for in-vitro susceptibility.

4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Rapilysin is indicated for the thrombolytic treatment of suspected myocardial infarction with persistent 
ST elevation or recent left Bundle Branch Block within 12 hours after the onset of acute myocardial 
infarction AMI symptoms.  
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Treatment with reteplase should be initiated as soon as possible after the onset of AMI symptoms. 
Rapilysin should be prescribed by physicians experienced in the use of thrombolytic treatment and 
with the facilities to monitor its use. 
Posology 
Dosage of Rapilysin 
Rapilysin is administered as a 10 U bolus dose followed by a second 10 U bolus dose 30 minutes later 
(double bolus). 
Each bolus is administered as a slow intravenous injection within 2 minutes. Ensure that the injection 
is not mistakenly given paravenously. 
Heparin and acetylsalicylic acid should be administered before and following the administration of 
Rapilysin to reduce the risk of re-thrombosis. 
Dosage of Heparin 
The recommended dose of heparin is 5000 I.U. given as a bolus injection prior to reteplase therapy 
followed by an infusion of 1000 I.U. per hour starting after the second reteplase bolus. Heparin should 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be administered for at least 24 hours, preferably for 48 – 72 hours, aiming to keep aPTT values 1.5 to 
2 times normal. 
Dosage of Acetylsalicylic Acid 
The initial dose of acetylsalicylic acid prior to thrombolysis should be at least 250 mg (250 – 350 mg) 
followed by 75 – 150 mg/day at least until discharge. 
Paediatric population 
No data are available. 
Method of administration 
Reteplase is supplied as a freeze-dried substance in vials. The lyophilisate is reconstituted with the 
contents of the accompanying syringe. For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product 
before administration, see section 6.6. 
Rapilysin should be injected preferably through an intravenous line whose sole purpose is the injection 
of Rapilysin. No other medicines should be injected through the line reserved for Rapilysin, neither at 
the same time, nor prior to, nor following Rapilysin injection. This applies to all products including 
heparin, and acetylsalicylic acid, which should be administered before and following the 
administration of reteplase to reduce the risk of re-thrombosis. 
In those patients where the same line has to be used, this line (including Y-line) must be flushed 
thoroughly with 0.9 % sodium chloride or 5 % glucose solution prior to and following the Rapilysin 
injection. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Because thrombolytic therapy increases the risk of bleeding, reteplase is contra-indicated in the 
following situations: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
known haemorrhagic diathesis 
patients with current concomitant therapy with oral anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin sodium) 
intracranial neoplasm, arteriovenous malformation or aneurysm 
neoplasm with increased bleeding risk 
history of cerebrovascular accident 
recent (< 10 days) prolonged and vigorous external heart massage 
severe uncontrolled hypertension 
active peptic ulceration  
portal hypertension (oesophageal varices) 
severe liver or renal dysfunction 
acute pancreatitis, pericarditis, bacterial endocarditis 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
within 3 months of severe bleeding, major trauma or major surgery (e.g. coronary artery bypass 
graft, intracranial or intraspinal surgery or trauma), obstetrical delivery, organ biopsy, previous 
puncture of non-compressible vessels. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Each patient being considered for therapy with reteplase should be carefully evaluated. 
For information on product incompatibilities see section 6.2. 
Bleeding 
The most common complication encountered during reteplase therapy is bleeding. In the following 
conditions the risks of reteplase therapy may be increased and should be weighed against the 
anticipated benefits: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
cerebrovascular disease 
systolic blood pressure at entry > 160 mmHg 
recent gastrointestinal or genitourinary bleeding (within 10 days) 
high likelihood of left heart thrombus, e.g. mitral stenosis with atrial fibrillation 
septic thrombophlebitis or occluded arteriovenous cannula at seriously infected site 
age over 75 years 
any other condition in which bleeding constitutes a significant hazard or would be  particularly 
difficult because of its location 
The concomitant use of heparin anticoagulation may contribute to bleeding. As fibrin is lysed during 
reteplase therapy, bleeding from recent puncture sites may occur. Therefore, thrombolytic therapy 
requires careful attention to all possible bleeding sites (including catheter insertion sites, arterial and 
venous puncture sites, cut down sites and needle puncture sites). The use of rigid catheter as well as 
intramuscular injections and nonessential handling of the patient should be avoided during treatment 
with reteplase. 
Caution should be employed when used with other medicinal products affecting haemostasis such as 
heparin, low-molecular-weight heparins, heparinoids, oral anticoagulants and antiplatelet agents other 
than acetylsalicylic acid, such as dipyridamole, ticlopidine, clopidogrel or glycoprotein IIb/IIIa 
receptor antagonists. 
Should serious bleeding, in particular cerebral haemorrhage, occur any concomitant heparin should be 
terminated immediately. In addition, the second bolus of reteplase should not be given if the serious 
bleeding occurs before it is administered. In general, however, it is not necessary to replace the 
coagulation factors because of the relatively short half-life of reteplase. Most patients who have 
bleeding can be managed by interruption of thrombolytic and anticoagulant therapy, volume 
replacement and manual pressure applied to an incompetent vessel. Protamine should be considered if 
heparin has been administered within 4 hours of the onset of bleeding. In the patients who fail to 
respond to these conservative measures, judicious use of transfusion products may be indicated. 
Transfusions of cryoprecipitate, fibrinogen, fresh frozen plasma and platelets should be considered 
with clinical and laboratory reassessment after each administration. A target fibrinogen level of 1 g/l is 
desirable with cryoprecipitate or fibrinogen infusion. 
At present, insufficient data in patients with a diastolic blood pressure > 100 mmHg prior to 
thrombolytic therapy are available for reteplase. 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Arrhythmias 
Coronary thrombolysis may result in arrhythmias associated with reperfusion. It is strongly 
recommended that antiarrhythmic therapy for bradycardia and/or ventricular tachyarrhythmias (e.g. 
ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation) be available when reteplase is administered. 
Readministration 
Since at present there is no experience with readministration of reteplase, the readministration is not 
recommended. However, no antibody formation to the reteplase molecule has been observed. 
If an anaphylactoid reaction occurs, the injection should be discontinued immediately and appropriate 
therapy should be initiated. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed. Retrospective analyses of clinical studies did not reveal 
any clinically relevant interactions with medicinal product used concomitantly with reteplase in 
patients with acute myocardial infarction. Heparin, vitamin K antagonists and medicinal product that 
alter platelet function (such as acetylsalicylic acid, dipyridamole and abciximab) may increase the risk 
of bleeding if administered prior to, during or after reteplase therapy. 
Attention should be paid to this effect especially during periods of low plasma fibrinogen (up to about 
2 days after fibrinolytic therapy of AMI). 
For information on product incompatibilities see section 4.2. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no adequate data on the use of reteplase in pregnant women. The only relevant available 
animal data refer to studies performed in rabbits, which showed vaginal bleedings associated with 
abortions (see section 5.3). The potential risk for humans is unknown. 
Except in life-threatening situations, Rapilysin should not be used in pregnant women. 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether reteplase is excreted into breast milk. Breast milk should be discarded within 
the first 24 hours after thrombolytic therapy. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Not relevant. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most commonly reported adverse drug reaction associated with reteplase treatment is haemorrhage, 
predominantly at the injection site. Local reactions at injection site can also occur. 
As with other thrombolytic agents, recurrent ischaemia/angina, hypotension and heart failure/pulmonary 
oedema  have  been  reported  frequently  as  sequelae  of  myocardial  infarction  and/or  thrombolytic 
administration. 
Haemorrhage 
The most frequent adverse drug reaction associated with reteplase treatment is haemorrhage. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reports of intracranial bleeding, many of which are fatal, are of particular concern. 
Systolic blood pressure over 160 mmHg before thrombolysis with reteplase was associated with 
greater risk for cerebral bleeding. The risk of intracranial bleeding and fatal intracranial bleeding 
increases with increasing age. Blood transfusions were rarely required. Death and permanent disability 
are not uncommonly reported in patients who have experienced stroke (including intracranial 
bleeding) and other serious bleeding episodes. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The frequency of adverse reactions reported is listed in the following table. Frequencies are defined as 
very common (≥ 1/10), common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10), uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 
1/10,000 to < 1/1,000), very rare (< 1/10,000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available

1. Available evidence on reteplase does not indicate an antibody-mediated origin of these 
hypersensitivity reactions. 
2. Ischaemic or haemorrhagic cerebrovascular events may be contributing or underlying conditions. 
3. As with other thrombolytic agents these cardiovascular events have been reported as sequelae of 
myocardial infarction and/or thrombolytic administration. These events can be life-threatening and 
may lead to death. 
4. This event has been reported for the therapeutic class of thrombolytic agents. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In the event of overdosage one might expect depletion of fibrinogen and other blood coagulation 
components (e.g. coagulation factor V) with a consequent risk of bleeding. 
For further information see section 4.4, section bleeding.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antithrombotic agent, ATC Code: B01AD07 
Mechanism of action 
Reteplase is a recombinant plasminogen activator that catalyzes the cleavage of endogenous 
plasminogen to generate plasmin. This plasminogenolysis occurs preferentially in the presence of 
fibrin. Plasmin in turn degrades fibrin, which is the main component of the matrix of thrombi, thereby 
exerting its thrombolytic action. 
Reteplase (10+10 U) dose-dependently reduces plasma fibrinogen levels by about 60 to 80 %. The 
fibrinogen level normalises within 2 days. As with other plasminogen activators a rebound 
phenomenon then occurs during which fibrinogen levels reach a maximum within 9 days and remain 
elevated for up to 18 days. 
Reductions of plasma levels of plasminogen and α2-antiplasmin normalise within 1 to 3 days. 
Coagulation factor V, clotting factor VIII, α2-macroglobulin, and C1-esterase inhibitor are only 
slightly reduced and normalise within 1 to 2 days. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) activity 
can be reduced to around zero, but rapidly normalises within two hours showing a rebound 
phenomenon. Prothrombin activation fragment 1 levels and thrombin-antithrombin III-complexes 
increase during thrombolysis indicating thrombin production of which the clinical relevance is 
unknown. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
A large comparative mortality trial (INJECT) in approx. 6000 patients showed that reteplase reduced 
the incidence of heart failure (secondary efficacy criterion) in a significant manner and was at least 
equally effective in terms of reducing mortality (primary efficacy criterion) when compared to 
streptokinase. In two clinical trials aiming primarily at coronary artery patency (RAPID I and II) 
reteplase was associated with higher early patency rates (primary efficacy criterion), as well as with a 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
lower incidence of heart failure (secondary efficacy criterion) than alteplase (3 hour and "accelerated" 
dosage regimens). A clinical trial in approximately 15 000 patients comparing reteplase with the 
accelerated dose regimen of alteplase (GUSTO III) (2:1 randomisation reteplase: alteplase) did not 
show statistically different results for the primary endpoint of 30-day mortality (reteplase: 7.47 %, 
alteplase 7.23 %, p = 0.61) or for the combined endpoint of 30-day mortality and non-fatal disabling 
stroke (reteplase: 7.89 %, alteplase 7.88 %, p = 0.99). Overall stroke rates were 1.64 % in the reteplase 
and 1.79 % in the alteplase group. In the reteplase group, 49.4 % of these strokes were fatal and 
27.1 % were disabling. In the alteplase group 33.0 % were fatal and 39.8 % were disabling. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Elimination 
Following intravenous bolus injection of 10 + 10 U in patients with acute myocardial infarction 
reteplase antigen is distributed in plasma with a dominant half-life (t1/2α) of 18±5 min and eliminated 
with a terminal half-life (t1/2ß) of 5.5 hours±12.5 min at a clearance rate of 121±25 ml/min. Reteplase 
activity is cleared from the plasma at a rate of 283±101 ml/min, resulting in a dominant half-life 
(t1/2α) of 14.6±6.7 min and a terminal half-life (t1/2ß) of 1.6 hours±39 min. Only minor amounts of 
reteplase were immunologically detected in the urine. Exact data on the main elimination routes for 
reteplase in humans are not available and the consequences of hepatic or renal insufficiency are not 
known. Experiments in rats indicate that the liver and the kidneys are the main organs of active uptake 
and lysosomal degradation. 
Additional studies in human plasma samples in vitro suggest that complexation with C1-inactivator, 
α2-antiplasmin and α2-antitrypsin contributes to the inactivation of reteplase in plasma. The relative 
contribution of the inhibitors to inactivation of reteplase decreases as follows: C1-inactivator > α2-
antiplasmin > α2-antitrypsin. 
The half-life of reteplase was increased in patients with AMI as compared to healthy volunteers. An 
additional increase of half-life of activity in patients with myocardial infarction and severely impaired 
liver and renal function cannot be excluded, but no clinical data of pharmacokinetics of reteplase in 
these patients are available. Animal data show that in case of severely impaired renal function with a 
pronounced increase in serum creatinine and serum urea an increase in half-life of reteplase has to be 
expected. Mild impairment of renal function did not significantly affect the pharmacokinetic 
properties of reteplase. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Acute toxicity studies were performed in rats, rabbits and monkeys Subacute toxicity studies were 
performed in rats, dogs and monkeys. The predominant acute symptom after single high doses of 
reteplase in rats and rabbits was transient apathy shortly after injection. In cynomolgus monkeys, the 
sedative effect ranged from slight apathy to unconsciousness, caused by a reversible dose-related drop 
in blood pressure. There was increased local haemorrhage at the injection site. 
Subacute toxicity studies did not reveal any unexpected adverse events. In dogs repeated dosing of the 
human peptide reteplase led to immunologic-allergic reactions. Genotoxicity of reteplase was 
excluded by a complete battery of tests at different genetic end points in vitro and in vivo. 
Reproductive toxicity studies were performed in rats (fertility and embryo-foetotoxicity study 
including a littering phase) and in rabbits (embryo-foetotoxicity study, dose-range finding only). In 
rats, a species insensitive to the pharmacological effects of reteplase, there were no adverse effects on 
fertility, embryo-foetal development and offspring. In rabbits, vaginal bleedings and abortions 
possibly associated to prolonged haemostasis, but no foetal abnormalities were noted. A pre- and 
postnatal toxicity study was not performed with reteplase.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Rapilysin is and what it is used for 
Rapilysin contains the active substance reteplase(a recombinant plasminogen activator). It is a 
thrombolytic medicine used to dissolve blood clots that have formed in certain blood vessels and to 
restore the blood flow in these blocked vessels (=thrombolysis). 
Rapilysin is used after an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) in order to dissolve the blood clot 
causing the heart attack. It is given within 12 hours after the onset of symptoms. 
2.  What you need to know before Rapilysin is given to you 
The doctor will ask you questions before giving you Rapilysin, to find out if you have an increased 
risk of bleeding. 
Do not use Rapilysin 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
if you are allergic to reteplase or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 
6). 
if you have a bleeding disorder. 
if you are taking medicine to thin your blood (oral anticoagulants, e.g. warfarin). 
if you have a brain tumour or a malformed blood vessel or a vessel wall dilatation (aneurysm) in 
the brain. 
if you have other tumours associated with an increased risk of bleeding. 
if you have had a stroke. 
if you have had external heart massage within the past 10 days. 
if you have severe uncontrolled high blood pressure (hypertension). 
if you have an ulcer in the stomach or small intestine. 
if you have enlarged blood vessels in the gullet (oesophagus) (frequently caused by liver 
disease). 
if you have severe liver or kidney disease. 
if you have acute inflammation of the pancreas or pericardium (the sac surrounding the heart), 
or an infection of the heart muscle (bacterial endocarditis). 
if you have in the past 3 months had severe bleeding, a major injury or major surgery (e.g. 
coronary artery bypass graft, or surgery or injury to the head or spine), given birth, or had an 
organ biopsy or other medical / surgical procedure.

Warnings and precautions 
Bleeding 
The most common side effect of Rapilysin is bleeding. Therefore Rapilysin must be given only in the 
presence and under the instructions of an emergency doctor. 
Pay careful attention to all possible bleeding sites (e.g. injection sites). Heparin, which is given 
together with Rapilysin, may also increase bleeding. 
The risks of Rapilysin treatment may be increased if you have any of the following conditions: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
diseases of the blood vessels in the brain 
systolic blood pressure higher than 160 mmHg 
bleeding in the gastrointestinal, urinary or genital tract within the past 10 days 
high likelihood of a blood clot in the heart (e.g. as a result of narrowing of a heart valve or atrial 
fibrillation) 
septic inflammation of a vein with blood clotting (septic thrombophlebitis) or blocked blood 
vessels at an infected site 
age over 75 years 
any other condition in which bleeding might be especially dangerous or might occur at a site 
where it would be difficult to control 
• 
• 
• 
At present, little data are available on the use of Rapilysin in patients with diastolic blood pressure 
higher than 100 mmHg. 
Abnormal heart beats (arrhythmias) 
Thrombolytic treatment may cause the heart to beat irregularly. Therefore tell the medical staff 
immediately if you 
• 
feel palpitations or an irregular heart beat 
Repeated use 
At present there is no experience with repeated use of Rapilysin. Therefore, repeated use is not 
recommended. Antibody formation to the reteplase molecule has not been seen. 
Children 
Safety and effectiveness of Rapilysin in children have not been established. Treatment of children with 
Rapilysin is not recommended. 
Other medicines and Rapilysin: 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Heparin and other medicines that thin the blood (anticoagulants) and acetylsalicylic acid (a substance 
used in many medicines used to relieve pain and lower fever) may increase the risk of bleeding. 
For information on medicines that should not be physically mixed with Rapilysin solution for 
injection, see section 3. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before taking this medicine. 
Pregnancy 
There is no experience with Rapilysin in pregnant women. Therefore it should not be used except in 
life-threatening situations. You must tell your doctor if you are pregnant or think you are pregnant. 
Your doctor can tell you the risks and benefits of using Rapilysin during pregnancy. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Breast-feeding 
You should not breast-feed your baby during treatment with Rapilysin as it is not known whether 
Rapilysin is excreted into mother’s milk. Mother’s milk should be thrown away during the first 24 
hours after thrombolytic treatment. Discuss with your doctor when you can take up breast-feeding 
again. 
3. 
How to use Rapilysin  
Rapilysin is usually given in a hospital. The medicine is supplied in vials as a powder for injection. 
Before use, the powder for injection must be dissolved in the water for injection supplied in the 
prefilled syringe that is in the package. Do not add any other medicines. The resulting solution must be 
used immediately. The solution must be examined to ensure that only clear, colourless solution is 
injected. If the solution is not clear and colourless it should be thrown away. 
Treatment with Rapilysin 10 U should be started as soon as possible after the symptoms of heart attack 
begin. 
Heparin and Rapilysin cannot be mixed in the same solution. Other medicines may also not mix well 
with Rapilysin. No other medicines should be added to the injection solution (see below). Rapilysin 
should be injected preferably through an intravenous line that is used only for the injection of 
Rapilysin. No other medicines should be injected through the line reserved for Rapilysin, either at the 
same time, or before or after Rapilysin injection. This applies to all medicines including heparin and 
acetylsalicylic acid, which are given before and after Rapilysin to reduce the risk of new blood clots 
forming. 
If the same line has to be used, this line (including Y-line) must be flushed thoroughly with a 0.9 % 
sodium chloride or 5 % glucose solution before and after the Rapilysin injection.  
Dosage of Rapilysin 
Rapilysin is given as a 10 U injection followed by a second 10 U injection 30 minutes later (double 
bolus).  
Each injection should be given slowly within 2 minutes. The injection must not be given mistakenly 
outside the vein. Therefore, be sure to tell the medical staff if you experience pain during the injection. 
Heparin and acetylsalicylic acid are given before and after Rapilysin to reduce the risk of new blood 
clots forming. 
Dosage of Heparin 
The recommended dose of heparin is 5000 I.U. given as a single injection before Rapilysin, followed 
by an infusion of 1000 I.U. per hour starting after the second Rapilysin injection. Heparin should be 
given for at least 24 hours, preferably for 48-72 hours, in order to keep aPTT values 1.5 to 2 times 
normal. 
Dosage of Acetylsalicylic Acid  
The dose of acetylsalicylic acid given before Rapilysin should be at least 250 mg-350 mg and should 
be followed by 75-150 mg/day, at least until discharge from hospital. 
If more Rapilysin is used than recommended 
In the event of overdosage there may be an increased risk of bleeding.

• 
• 
• 
Very rare side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) 
• 
Events related to the nervous system (e.g. epileptic seizure, convulsion, speech disorder, 
delirium, agitation, confusion, depression, psychosis)  
severe allergic reaction, causing shock or collapse 
• 
Side effects of frequency not known (cannot be estimated from the available data) 
• 
Blockage of blood vessels due to cholesterol (fat) 
Cardiovascular events can be life-threatening or cause death.  
Patients with systolic blood pressure over 160 mmHg have a greater risk of bleeding in the brain. The 
risk of intracranial bleeding and fatal intracranial bleeding increases with increasing age. Blood 
transfusions were rarely required. Death or permanent disability are not uncommon in patients who 
have a stroke (including bleeding in the brain) or other serious bleeding problem. 
Be sure to tell hospital staff immediately if any of these symptoms appear.  
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Instructions for use/handling 
Incompatibility of some prefilled glass syringes (including Rapilysin) with certain needle free 
connectors has been reported. Therefore, the compatibility of the glass syringe and intravenous access 
should be ensured before use. In case of incompatibility an adaptor can be used and removed together 
with the glass syringe immediately after administration 
Use aseptic technique throughout.

3. 
4. 
Remove the protective flip-cap from the vial of Rapilysin 10 U and clean the rubber closure 
with an alcohol wipe. 
Open the package containing the reconstitution spike, remove both protective caps from the 
reconstitution spike. 
Insert the spike through the rubber closure into the vial of Rapilysin 10 U. 
Take the 10 ml syringe out of the package. Remove the tip cap from the syringe. Connect the 
syringe to the reconstitution spike and transfer the 10 ml of solvent into the vial of Rapilysin 
10 U. 
5.  With the reconstitution spike and syringe still attached to the vial, swirl the vial gently to 
dissolve the Rapilysin 10 U powder. DO NOT SHAKE.  
6. 
The reconstituted preparation results in a clear, colourless solution. If the solution is not clear 
and colourless it should be discarded. 
7.  Withdraw 10 ml of Rapilysin 10 U solution back into the syringe. A small amount of solution 
may remain in the vial due to overfill. 
8. 
9. 
Disconnect the syringe from the reconstitution spike. The dose is now ready for intravenous 
administration. 
No other medicines should be injected through the line reserved for Rapilysin either at the same 
time, or prior to, or following Rapilysin injection. This applies to all products including heparin 
and acetylsalicylic acid, which should be administered before and following the administration 
of reteplase to reduce the risk of re-thrombosis. 
10. 
In those patients where the same line has to be used, this line (including Y-line) must be flushed 
thoroughly with a 0.9 % sodium chloride or 5 % glucose solution prior to and following the 
Rapilysin injection.
